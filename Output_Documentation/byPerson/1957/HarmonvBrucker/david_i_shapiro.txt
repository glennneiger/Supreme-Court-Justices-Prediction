mr.
david
i.
shapiro
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
the
army
can
give
a
soldier
a
less
than
honorable
discharge
certificate,
when
the
actual
character
of
that
soldiers
service,
require
that
the
army
give
him
nothing
less
than
an
honorable
discharge.
these
are
the
facts,
on
the
31st
day
of
october,
1952,
the
petitioner
who
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york,
a
law
student
and
perspective
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar.
he
was
newly
inducted
into
the
army
under
the
provisions
of
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
of
1948.
on
february
9,
1954,
15
months
had
already
elapsed
from
the
time
he
had
been
inducted.
his
service,
as
disclosed
by
his
service
record,
was
excellent
and
he
was
then
directed
to
reply
the
certain
specific
derogatory
information.
contained
in
the
letter
of
allegations
proceed
from
the
adjutant
general
of
the
army.
this
derogatory
information
was
that
in
1951
and
1952,
he
worked
at
a
place
called
camp
lakeland
reportedly,
a
communist
operated
camp.
in
1949,
he
was
employed
by
the
detroit
urban
league
according
to
the
army
a
subversive
organization.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
it
is.
in
1952,
it
registered
to
vote
in
new
york
city
with
the
american
labor
party
which
had
been
cited
by
a
house
committee
as
under
communist
control.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that
he
had
been
employed
by
the
detroit
urban
league
i
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
it
is
not.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
according
to
the
army's
letter
of
allegations,
it
was
reportedly
a
subversive
organization.
how
it
got
there,
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
didn't
say
the
national
urban
league
but
they
--
they
did
specify
the
detroit
urban
league.
the
fourth
allegation
basically
was
that
he
had
solicited
contributions
for
the
legal
defense
of
persons
who
had
been
indictment
under
the
smith
act.
now,
harmon
was
also
directed
to
reply
to
certain
derogatory
information
concerning
both
his
father
and
his
stepmother
and
both
of
whom
were
alleged
to
have
had
subversive
associations,
his
father
reportedly,
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
several
weeks
after
he
got
the
letter
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
are
set
forth
at
pages
3
and
4
of
the
record
in
this
case.
that's
the
printed
record,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
he
did.
he
replied
with
respect
to
himself
and
he
said
that
he
was
not
then
and
he
had
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
but
he
refused
categorically
to
answer
any
questions
with
respect
to
either
his
father
or
his
stepmother.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
all
of
the
letter
of
allegations,
all
of
the
allegations
contained
in
the
letter,
relate
solely
to
legal
activities
which
this
young
man
carried
on
as
a
civilian
prior
to
the
time
he
was
inducted
into
the
army
with
two
exceptions.
he
continued
his
association
with
both
his
father
and
his
stepmother.
and
several
weeks
after
he'd
been
inducted,
he
did
write
a
letter
to
two
civilian
friends,
in
which
he
asked
that
they
make
a
contribution
to
the
legal
defense
of
two
persons
who'd
been
indicted
under
the
smith
act.
now,
on
the
2nd
of
june,
1954,
without
any
notice
or
hearing
or
whatever
other
than
this
letter
of
allegations
received
on
february
9th.
former
private
harmon
was
escorted
off
the
military
post
at
camp
pickett,
virginia
with
an
undesirable
discharge
certificate
in
his
pocket.
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
entire
19
months,
this
young
was
in
the
army,
the
only
known
ratings
on
his
service
record
were
excellent,
both
as
to
character
and
fitness.
six
days
after
his
undesirable
discharge,
harmon
applied
to
the
army
discharge
review
board
for
a
change
to
the
discharge
certificate
from
undesirable
to
honorable
and
he
appeared
before
that
board
and
testified
that
he'd
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
any
subversive
organization
and
he
was
completely
(inaudible)
loyal
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
and
further
than
that,
he
wouldn't
hesitate
to
lay
down
his
life
and
defense
of
his
country
against
any
or
all
of
its
enemies
whomsoever.
he
stated
this
under
oath.
on
the
15th
of
november,
the
same
year,
his
appeal
was
denied
and
then
he
immediately
appealed
to
the
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records.
but
they
wouldn't
even
hear
him
and
that
appeal
was
denied.
and
then
he
finally
appealed
to
the
secretary
of
the
army
himself
and
he
waited.
he
waited
until
may
2nd,
1955,
and
then
he
commenced
the
action
which
resulted
in
--
are
being
here
today.
he
brought
litigation
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
columbia,
in
which
he
prayed
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
which
would
invalidate
the
receipt
of
the
undesirable
discharge
and
he
also
asked
for
a
leave
which
would
change
the
character
of
the
discharge
certificate
from
undesirable
to
honorable.
now,
after
the
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court,
counsel
was
informed
that
the
army
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records,
which
wouldn't
even
hear
the
case
before,
had
been
ordered
to
make
a
fresh
evaluation
of
the
case.
now,
we
replied
that
we
would
rely
on
the
evidence,
which
had
already
been
furnished
through
testimony
before
the
army
discharge
review
board.
and
which
had
already
been
placed,
the
complete
file
of
transcript
and
record
into
the
hands
of
the
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records
since
we
have
no
additional
evidence
to
present
and
on
the
basis
of
the
plan
and
transcript
before
the
discharge
review
board,
the
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records
once
again
refused
to
change
the
character
of
the
discharge
certificate.
now,
in
the
district
court,
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment,
judgment
was
granted
in
the
army's
favor,
the
sole
ground
being
that
the
district
court
lack
jurisdiction
to
review
the
issuance
of
the
undesirable
discharge
certificate.
but
before
argument
was
had
in
the
court
of
appeals,
petitioner
was
notified
that
his
undesirable
discharge
certificate
had
been
up
rate.
he
wasn't
given
an
honorable
discharge.
he
was
given
something
in
between
that,
something
which
is
universally
regarded
by
everyone
as
“substandard”,
a
general
under
“honorable”
conditions
discharge.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
in
the
court
of
appeals
suggesting
mootness,
but
the
application
was
denied.
however,
on
the
31st
of
january
of
last
year,
1957,
the
court
below
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
judge
bazelon
dissented.
your
honors,
we
think
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
as
judge
bazelon
points
out
very
clearly
in
his
dissent
alone,
is
whether
section
4
(b)
of
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
pursuant
to
which
directive
5210.9,
and
that's
the
department
of
defense
directive
under
which
harmon
was
given
his
original
undesirable
discharge,
authorizes
the
issuance
of
less
than
honorable
discharge
certificate
in
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
now,
we
really
think
that
that's
the
only
issue
before
this
court
and
while
respondents
brief
includes
it
in
its
counter
statement
of
questions
presented,
his
entire
brief
is
spent
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
answering
that
question.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
we
say
that
that
is
really
the
key
issue
here
because
if
this
particular
direct
in
the
sense
that
we
claim
that
it
was
invalid
--
invalidly
authorized
and
void,
was
validly
authorized.
then
of
course,
his
position
has
a
great
deal
more
merit
but
if
it
was
not
validly
authorized,
if
in
fact
it
was
actually
in
excess
of
the
authority
granted
to
the
secretary
of
defense
under
section
4
(b),
then
we
say
that
the
entire
case
that
the
respondent
has
made
out
false.
and
i
think
i
can
make
that
clear.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i'm
saying
that
it
has
no
right
to
use
the
discharge
certificate,
this
kind
of
discharge
certificate
to
this
particular
petitioner,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
for
situations
that
are
appropriate
to
it.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
simply
this.
if
a
man
is
an
excellent
soldier,
his
discharge
certificate
has
got
to
say
so.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
that
true
and
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
major
allegations
in
this
case,
there
is
one
exception.
it
was
preinduction
conduct
and
activity
but
we
rest
here
on
a
broader
gap
ground
because
of
the
fact
that
several
weeks
after
he'd
been
inducted,
he
did
write
a
letter
to
two
civilian
friends,
which
was
made
the
subject
of
the
letter
of
allegation.
what
we're
really
contending
is
this.
that
a
man
can
be
a
security
risk,
whatever
that
is,
but
if
he
really
is
an
excellent
soldier
then
his
discharge
certificate
has
got
to
reflect
the
actual
character
of
the
service
he
is
rendering.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i'm
not
doing
that
because
on
the
record
here
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
question
of
the
character
of
the
service.
this
man's
service
for
all
the
time
that
he
was
in
except
for
two
periods
of
several
weeks,
were
known.
they
were
characterized
by
his
specific
commanding
officer
and
they
were
characterized
on
his
service
record,
both
with
respect
to
his
character
and
his
efficiency,
as
being
excellent.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
for
this
reason
and
that's
with
respect
to
this
particular
kind
of
case
because
the
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
which
is
army
regulation
615-360.
specifically
steps
and
that's
the
regulation,
his
own
regulation
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
discharge
certificates
and
which
sets
forth
the
criteria
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
honorable
discharge
certificates
states
as
follows,
“an
honorable
discharge
certificate
will
be
furnished
when
the
individual
meets
the
following
qualifications,
one
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
page
52
to
54,
your
honor
of
our
brief,
it
in
our
appendix.
that's
paragraph
--
it's
actually
on
page
52.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
in
our
petitioner's
brief,
that's
page
52.
one
has
character
ratings
of
at
least
very
good.
two,
has
efficiency
ratings
of
at
least
excellent.
three,
has
not
been
convicted
by
a
general
court
martial.
four,
has
not
been
convicted
more
than
once
by
a
special
court
martial.
now,
the
petitioner
met
all
of
these
qualifications
yet
he
was
furnished
a
substandard
discharge
certificate.
despite
the
fact
that
paragraph
seven
of
this
very
same
regulation
says,
“because
the
type
of
discharge
may
significantly
influence
an
individual
civilian
rights,
it
is
essential
that
all
factors
be
considered
so
that
the
type
of
discharge
reflect
accurately
the
nature
of
the
service
rendered.”
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
exception,
your
honor
is
the
exception
which
leads
us
into
the
department
of
defense
directive
5210.9.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
it
is
your
honor
and
i
think
really
that's
the
key
to
the
problem
of
the
case
for
these
reason.
when
a
man
commits
an
offense
against
the
civil
law
and
he's
in
the
army,
he
is
nevertheless
committing
an
act
which
is
very
much
relevant
to
his
service
because
he
is
placing
himself
by
his
conduct,
during
the
time
that
he
is
in
the
army
in
a
position
where
he
may
be
completely
disabled
by
the
nature
of
the
action
of
the
civil
--
civil
authorities
and
by
having
himself
incarcerated
and
to
doing
any
kind
of
service
for
the
army
whatever.
whereas
here,
the
activities
that
this
young
man
engaged
in,
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
and
were
completely
extraneous
from,
the
character
of
the
actual
military
service
that
he
gave
the
army
all
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
service.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
exactly.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
it
depends
of
course,
your
honor,
upon
your
definition
of
the
term
by
soldiering.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
if
he
committed
any
act
which
would
reflect
adversely,
as
the
opinion
of
an
attorney
general
on
this
particular
statute
has
said,
upon
his
military
career
such
as
powerless
for
example.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
could
extend
that
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
would
think,
your
honor
that
it
would
have
to
in
some
way
relate,
in
some
way.
and
i
think,
we
can
stretch
the
term
relate
as
far
as
it
goes
to
the
--
to
the
term
soldiering
before
it
could
have
some
effect
upon
the
discharge
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
really
know,
your
honor.
but
i
do
know
this
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
it's
a
violation
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
in
one
sense
your
honor
you
do,
but
if
the
first
question
is
answered,
then
all
of
the
subsidiary
questions
which
involve
this
question
to
of
jurisdiction
to
review
or
with
it
and
this
is
the
reason
for
that.
now,
in
the
respondents
brief
he
says,
first,
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
and
second
that
this
petitioner
has
suffered
no
injury
to
a
legally
protected
right.
now,
despite
the
holdings
below,
the
very
question
of
jurisdiction
to
review
was
specifically
left
open
by
this
court
in
a
case
called
patterson
against
lamb.
but
when
it's
considered
that
the
discharge
certificate
itself
confers
a
valuable
kind
of
status
and
the
district
judge
said
it
conferred
property
rights,
community
rights,
civil
respect
and
honor.
we
really
think
the
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
to
review
whenever
the
military's
action
was
arbitrary,
capricious
or
clearly
erroneous
is
a
matter
of
law.
now,
we
think
also
they
have
jurisdictional
review
if
the
challenge
of
the
administrative
determination
was
based
on
an
ultra
vires
for
unconstitutional
administrative
regulation,
as
we
say
it
was
in
this
case.
and
we
certainly
think
that
they
have
jurisdictional
review
with
constitutional
rights
had
been
invaded
by
that
action,
as
we
think
they
were
here.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i'd
like
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
it
also
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
because
under
this
court's
rule
of
restrictive
review
of
statutes
to
avoid
constitutional
questions.
we
think
the
statute
has
either
got.
number
one,
to
be
interpreted
in
the
manner
we
say
it
has
or
it's
got
to
be
stricken
down
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
none
whatever,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
believe
that
is
completely
conceded
except
that
it
may
violate
one
regulation
itself,
but
that's
the
regulation
which
is
attacked
here,

of
defense

5210.9.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
now,
under
the
holding
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
exactly,
that's
our
position.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not.
now,
that's
very
important
distinction.
in
all
of
the
cases
which
have
been
before
this
court
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
the
discharge,
these
cases
were
concerned
with
the
fact
of
discharge
itself.
now,
the
fact
of
discharge
is
not
in
this
case
at
all.
we
say
that
none
of
the
constitutional
questions,
none
of
the
statutory
questions
in
this
case,
relate
in
any
way
to
the
fact
of
his
being
discharged.
the
army
could
have
always
gotten
rid
of
harmon
if
they
thought
that
security
reasons
warranted
or
for
whatever
reason
they
chose.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
yes,
in
this
sense.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
defame
the
character
of
the
discharge
certificate
because
in
our
view
of
the
case,
according
even
to
the
army's
own
regulations.
the
discharge
certificate
is
one
to
record
the
character
of
the
actual
--
record
number
one,
the
fact
of
the
separation
from
the
service
and
two,
the
character
of
the
service
rendered
during
the
period
covered
by
the
discharge.
that
is
during
the
time
he
was
actually
in.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
all
right.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
we
think
that
question
is
very
much
principally
involved
in
the
case,
the
question
of
preinduction
activities
in
conduct.
but
since
we
also
do
have
the
question
of
the
letter
writings
several
weeks
after
he
was
inducted,
we
take
the
position
that
the
letter
writing
was
completely
extraneous
to
the
character
of
a
service.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
unqualifiedly,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
that's
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
your
honor.
then
of
course
we'd
have
a
very
interesting
problem.
we'd
have
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
statement
was
actually
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
and
then
if
the
statement
for
example
was
libelous
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no.
it's
a
defaming
not
so
much
for
the
man
but
a
defaming
of
his
actual
record
of
military
service.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
it,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
our
point.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
--
i
understand
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i'd
like
to
continue
my
argument.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
two
questions
were
asked
to
me
yesterday
by
members
of
the
court
which
i
think
either,
one
i
was
unable
to
answer
or
two
which
i
don't
feel
that
i
have
answered
adequately.
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
before
continuing
with
my
argument
to
those
questions.
the
first
one
was
the
question
of
mr.
justice
black
as
to
whether
or
not
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
contained
a
provision
similar
to
the
one
with
respect
to
conduct
on
becoming
an
officer
or
a
gentleman
for
enlisted
personnel.
there
is
such
an
article
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
it's
the
general
article,
article
134.
so
it
seems
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
is
so
whole
that
an
individual
who
commits
a
crime
while
he
is
a
soldier
and
he
gets
in
trouble
with
the
civilian
authorities
would
be
subject
to
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
under
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
equally
true
is
the
situation
where
the
enlisted
man
writes
scandalous
letters
to
his
commanding
officer's
wife.
that
too
would
come
under
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
so
we
see
that
in
every
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
have
any
scandalous
conduct
which
would
reflect
adversely
on
the
army
would
come
within
the
provisions
of
article
134.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
at
all.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
think
that
they
could
with
–
under
article
134.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
agree
with
you,
sir,
on
that.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
agree
that
i
don't
think
they
could
take
notice
that
he
was
that
kind
of
a
person.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
i
don't
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
now,
i
think
from
the
answer
to
this
question,
it
now
becomes
clear
that
army
regulation
seeks
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
they
couldn't
discharge
him
if
he
wrote
such
kind
of
letters.
i
mean
they
could
discharge
him
for
any
reason
that
they
wanted
but
the
question
here
is
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
the
army
can
discharge
an
individual
for
any
reason
it
sees
fit.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
if
they
don't
like
his
face,
they
can
discharge
him.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
--
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
that
they
could
discharge
him
and
they
could
not
make
public
that
fact.
now,
i
think
we
can
see
then
that
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
yes.
now,
with
respect
to
army
regulation
615-360,
we
now
see
that
unless
the
man
has
been
subject
to
a
general
court-martial,
unless
he
has
been
subject
to
more
than
one
special
court-martial,
and
if
he
has
ratings
of
excellent
as
to
character
and
ratings
of
excellent
as
to
efficiency,
he
must
receive
under
615-360
an
honorable
discharge
with
of
course
the
exceptions
spelled
out
in
the
army
security
risk
regulation
as
set
up
and
established
by
department
of
defense
directive
5210.9,
which
we
are
challenging
here.
the
second
question
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
the
one
asked
to
me
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
that
question
was
whether
or
not
our
position
in
this
case
could
be
analogized
to
the
situation
of
an
individual
who
had
been
fired
from
government
civilian
employment.
and
the
question
i
think
was
whether
or
not
it
was
our
position
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
could
not
make
a
public
statement
saying
why
the
individual
had
been
discharged.
i
would
agree
with
that
position
but
that's
not
this
case.
an
army
discharge
certificate
is
not
a
notification
of
personnel
action
which
terminates
a
federal
civilian
employee
from
his
job.
an
army
discharge
certificate,
that
is
an
honorable
discharge
certificate,
is
much
more
than
that.
not
only
does
it
record
the
fact
of
the
separation
of
service
but
it
is
in
the
words
of
this
court,
a
formal
final
judgment
by
the
government
on
the
military
record
of
the
soldier.
and
from
that
document
comes
certain
very
valuable
rights,
community
respect
and
honor
are
established
by
it,
and
those
rights
are
conclusive,
property
rights,
rights
for
example
to
various
benefits
provided
by
the
state,
provided
by
the
federal
government,
flow
from
that
document.
and
a
certain
kind
of
personal
honor,
a
personal
status
of
community
respect
and
honor
are
inherent
within
the
document
itself.
and
i
think
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
inherent
in
the
honorable
discharge.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
with
respect
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
those
representations
are
as
follows.
that
during
the
time
the
individual
was
in
the
service,
he
comported
himself
honorably
and
he
left
the
service
in
a
status
of
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
say
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
say
if
that
did
not
come
under
article
134,
it
could
not
be
used
to
stigmatize
his
discharge
certificate.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
really
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
i
would
think
not.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
unless
he
was
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
under
134.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
think
that
they
very
well
might
but
they
haven't
yet.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
our
position
that
when
congress
reenacted
article
108
of
the
articles
of
war
and
now
it's
set
forth
in
the
present
statute
which
is
the
statute
of
may
5,
1950,
which
is
the
reenactment
of
article
108
and
they
reenacted
it
without
material
change.
it
is
our
position
that
they
--
that
they
incorporated
all
of
the
rulings
of
the
judge
advocate
general
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
within
their
reenactment.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
correct.
the
army
has
the
right,
i
think,
by
statute
to
give
a
number
of
various
kinds
of
discharges.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
can
give
an
honorable
discharge,
they
can
give
a
general
discharge
under
honorable
conditions,
they
can
give
an
undesirable
discharge,
they
can
give
a
bad
conduct
discharge
and
they
can
give
a
dishonorable
discharge.
the
dishonorable
discharge
is
by
sentence
of
general
court-martial,
the
others
are
through
administrative
regulation
which
have
been
established
by
the
secretary
and
have
been
within
his
power
since
the
time
the
articles
of
war
were
first
enacted.
now,
this
is
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
at
and
i
think
that
this
is
really
the
key
issue
with
regard
to
the
statutory
construction.
it's
just
this.
the
army,
in
issuing
the
kinds
of
discharges
that
they
issue
have
to
take
into
account
and
be
limited
by
those
things
which
are
relevant
to
the
discharge
itself.
for
example,
a
discharge
certificate
is
not
a
certification
by
the
army,
that
a
man
was
for
example
or
was
not
a
bank
robber,
before
he
was
inducted,
and
it's
not
a
certification
either
that
he
may
not
become
a
bank
robber
after
he's
released
from
the
military
service
and
goes
into
civilian
life.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
i
say
that
the
quality
of
his
character
is
very
much
related
to
his
soldiering
because
the
army
provides
a
system
whereby
his
character
can
be
rated.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
wherever
there
were
ratings
as
to
this
man's
character,
he
was
rated
as
excellent.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
under
honorable
--
general
under
honorable
conditions
discharge.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
it
is
not
an
honorable
discharge.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i'm
afraid
i
can't
speak
for
my
adversary,
sir,
but
i
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
think
that's
the
army's
position.
i
think
really
that
they
found
that
the
letters
were
really
de
minimis.
i
think
they
were
actually
concerned
with
the
conduct
which
predated
his
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
induction.
but
that
so
far
as
we're
concerned
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
we
think
that
because
of
the
two
letters
which
he
wrote,
the
army
could
consider
this
as
part
of
an
overall
question
of
conduct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
that
was,
and
i
couldn't
speak
of
course
for
the
army.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
--
i
would
think
that
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
conduct
which
occurred
subsequent
to
induction
was
de
minimis
or
not
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
question
for
this
court
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
really,
your
honor,
we're
not
limited
to
that
question
here
for
this
additional
reason.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
findings,
your
honor,
i
think
perhaps
it
might
have
to
be
sent
back
for
a
determination
as
to
what
the
army
relied
on.
but
i
really
feel
and
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
two
letters
that
this
man
did
write
after
he
was
inducted
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
actual
character
of
the
service
he
rendered.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
we
do
not
concede
that
all.
we
say
that
with
respect
to
pre-induction
conduct,
number
one,
and
with
conduct
antedating
induction,
having
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
character
of
the
service,
none
of
these
factors
can
be
considered
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
discharged
issue.
now,
let
me
go
into
the
jurisdictional
question
for
a
moment,
the
question
of
this
court's
power
to
review.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
to
review
the
issuance,
the
action
of
the
army
in
issuing
this
man
the
kind
of
discharge
he
was
issued
on
the
basic
facts
of
this
case
as
they
stand
admitted
before
the
court.
we
think
that
under
this
court's
holding
in
perkins
against
elg,
even
if
the
district
court
had
no
power
to
compel
the
army
to
issue
the
petitioner
here
an
honorable
discharge
certificate,
certainly,
we
think
it
had
the
power
to
declare
invalid
or
unconstitutional
the
kind
of
discharge
he
did
get
if
the
reasons
for
the
action
were
invalid
or
unconstitutional.
nevertheless,
the
respondent
argues
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
statutes
providing
for
the
board
--
the
army
discharge
review
board
and
the
army
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records,
demonstrate
a
congressional
intent
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
this
kind
of
case.
we
disagree.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
term
"final"
as
used
both
in
section
301
of
the
servicemen's
readjustment
act
of
1944
and
in
207
of
the
legislative
reorganization
act,
indicate
that
congress
did
not
preclude
judicial
review
of
arbitrary
or
capricious
administrative
action
by
the
military.
of
course,
if
congress
had
said
that
the
administrative
determination
not
only
should
be
final
and
conclusive
but
that
no
court
of
the
united
states
should
have
jurisdiction
to
review
such
determination,
of
course,
the
army's
position
would
be
much
stronger.
but
here,
so
far
as
section
207
is
concerned,
such
words
were
specifically
deleted
from
the
statute
by
committee
amendment.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
from
the
bill,
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
the
second
half
of
the
army's
attempt
to
sidestep
what
we
consider
the
basic
issue
here,
is
the
contention
that
harmon
has
not
suffered
injury
to
a
legally
protected
right.
the
army
says
that
since
the
general
under
honorable
conditions
discharge
entitles
harmon
to
virtually
all
federal
veterans'
benefits.
he
hasn't
suffered
the
kind
of
injury
which
would
give
him
the
standing
to
raise
the
issues
he
seeks
to
raise
in
this
case.
now,
while
it's
true
that
the
general
discharge
will
not
automatically
deprive
harmon
of
federal
veterans'
benefits,
he
will
be
deprived
of
a
number
of
veterans'
benefits
provided
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
new
york
statutes
make
marked
distinction
between
an
honorable
discharge
and
a
discharge
under
honorable
conditions
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
specifically
to
the
education
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
distinction
between
section
609
of
the
education
law
and
section
608
as
it's
discussed
in
our
brief.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
it's
set
forth,
your
honor,
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
but
we
think
more
important
than
the
loss
of
these
state
veterans'
benefits
is
the
stigma
which
attaches
to
anything
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
just
a
discharge
under
honorable
conditions,
they
don't
use
the
word
general
in
the
statute.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
section
608
has
to
do
with
soldiers
who
have
been
--
educational
benefits
for
soldiers
who
have
been
discharged
under
honorable
conditions.
and
section
609
has
to
do
with
scholarships
for
the
children
of
veterans
who
have
been
honorably
discharged.
the
types
of
discharge,
a
discharge
under
honorable
conditions
and
an
honorable
discharge
are
very,
very
much
different.
the
--the
army
regulations
themselves
indicate
that
the
general
discharge
is
basically
a
substandard
discharge
for
those
who
do
not
meet
the
qualifications
of
an
honorable
discharge.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
that's
been
in,
your
honor,
since
some
time
after
the
first
world
war,
but
i
don't
think
that
i'm
quite
sure
on
that.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
it's
established
by
army
regulation.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
think
that
they
make
that
kind
of
distinction
but
i
think
that
they've
inherently
made
that
distinction
in
the
statute
so
that
if
the
statute
would
be
applied
to
harmon's
children,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
an
educational
scholarship
for
those
children
under
section
609.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
it
would,
your
honor,
there
have
been
no
rulings
on
it,
but
i
do
think
they
would.
judge
frank
indicated
they
would
in
the
case
of
schustack
against
herren
which
was
in
the
second
circuit,
and
he
thought
they
would.
and
i
think
the
statute
shows
a
marked
distinction
between
an
honorable
conditions
discharge
and
an
honorable
discharge.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
an
air
force
regulation,
air
force
regulation
39-10
section
3,
which
provides
that
a
general
discharge
may
be
a
disadvantage
to
an
airman
seeking
civilian
employment.
and
we
say
that
much
more
important
than
the
state
veterans
benefits,
is
this
stigma
which
attaches
to
anything
other
than
an
honorable
discharge
and
much
more
important
in
mr.
harmon's
case
is
the
fact
that
as
a
law
student
and
perspective
candidate
for
admission
to
the
bar,
he
may
find
by
reason
of
the
general
and
honorable
conditions
discharge,
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
the
committee
on
character
and
fitness
for
the
first
judicial
department
of
that
state.
judge
bazelon
in
his
dissent
below,
we
think,
put
it
very,
very
succinctly
when
he
said,
"but
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
technical
legal
equivalence
or
difference
between
the
two
types
of
discharge
from
a
real
life
point
of
view,
they
are
vastly
different.
the
portion
of
our
population
holding
honorable
discharge
certificates
from
the
armed
services
is
now
so
great
that
an
adverse
reflection
is
inherent
in
a
certificate
which
is
other
than
honorable."
this
is
of
course
confirmed
by
the
statement
of
appellee's
counsel
in
oral
argument,
that
every
soldier
gets
an
honorable
discharge
unless
there
is
some
blemish
on
his
record
on
account
of
which
he
receives
the
discharge
other
than
honorable.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
because
the
term
is
general,
your
honor.
it's
an
administrative
discharge
which
--
i
mean
the
normal
type
of
discharge
is
an
honorable
discharge.
it
says
in
big
letters
on
it,
"honorable
discharge."
those
are
the
standard
words
which
are
used
on
the
discharge
certificate.
anything
other
than
that
immediately
catches
the
attention.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
now,
if
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
your
honor
and
that's
exactly
the
point
i'm
coming
to
now.
now,
it's
true
that
the
term
“army
regulations
604-10”,
that's
the
army
security
risk
regulation,
does
not
apply
on
harmon's
discharge
certificate
or
on
his
official
report
of
separation.
however,
both
the
department
of
defense
director
and
ar
604-10
itself
require
that
the
discharge
certificate
be
so
marked.
now,
since
clerical
mistakes
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
not
on
this
one,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
but
since
clerical
mistakes
or
omissions
can
always
be
corrected
on
the
separation
certificate
even
after
its
issue,
we
cannot
presume
unless
of
course
this
court
reverses
the
court
below
that
the
army
will
fail
to
correct
this
omission
or
mistake
from
its
own
--
in
accordance
with
its
own
regulation,
and
of
course
the
director
from
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
it's
sometimes
used
in
lieu.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
it's
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
actually,
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
--
they
are
interchangeable
in
this
sense.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
official
report
of
separation
from
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
is
today
given
for
those
who
are
released
from
active
military
duty
and
placed
in
the
inactive
reserve.
they
actually
do
not
get
an
honorable
discharge
certificate
until
they
have
completed
their
required
eight
years
of
two
years
active
service,
six
years
inactive
service.
so
that
for
--
in
the
large
part
of
those
people
who
are
inducted
under
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act,
they
get
when
they
are
released
to
the
inactive
reserve
what
is
know
as
an
official
report
of
separation,
the
dd
form
214,
which
in
most
cases
serves
in
lieu
of
the
honorable
discharge.
now
here,
this
man
was
discharged
before
his
24
months
of
active
military
duty.
so
he
did
get
a
discharge
certificate
as
well
as
an
official
report
of
separation.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
exactly
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
it
is,
your
honor.
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
be
--
presumed
to
say
that.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
it's
set
forth
at
111
and
112
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
we
are,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
we
say
that
that
has
--
that
statement
on
the
record
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
a
man's
service,
because
in
box
one,
the
first
box
you
come
to
on
the
official
report
of
separation,
is
the
box
which
says
"character
of
separation."
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
a
man
was
an
excellent
soldier,
the
character
of
separation
has
got
to
be
nothing
less
than
honorable.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
it
may
very
well,
your
honor,
it's
used
in
lieu
of
the
actual
discharge
certificate.
it's
the
thing
for
example
which
the
veterans
administration
uses
to
base
its
benefits
on.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
as
well
as
the
certificate
itself.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
with
the
general
discharge
being
subject
to
an
identification
of
the
type
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
that's
the
way
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
they
have
been
printed,
they
are
two
separate
documents.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
to
my
knowledge
it's
always
been
so.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
think
so,
but
i
think
they
get
a
different
kind
of
a
discharge
certificate
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
that
may
very
well
have
been
but
i
know
that
for
enlisted
men,
that
they
do
issue
two
separate
documents.
i
have
got
two
separate
ones.
[laughter]
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
there
are
normally
two
documents.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
that
the
basis
for
the
discharge
is
the
man's
military
record.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
not
on
his
discharge
certificate
or
on
his
official
report
of
separation.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
with
that
because
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
that's
never
shown
to
the
public.
that's
not
the
certification
that
the
man
has.
it's
not
the
document
which
gives
him
rights
to
various
benefits
and
to
what
we
term
community
respect
and
all.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
