justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
you're
reading
from
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
exception?
where
do
you
find
the
exception
as
referred
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
question
the
right
of
the
army
to
discharge
him
for
any
reason
that
wished
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
he'd
answered
the
questionnaire
and
said,
“yes,
i
am
member
of
so,
number
so
and
so,
the
communist
party.”
you
would
say
that
he
was
still
entitled
to
an
honorable
discharge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
--
that
what
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
first
of
all,
when
he
was
first
visiting
separately
in
the
service,
before
he
went
into
enlisted
reserve,
he
got
an
honorable
discharge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
in
others
it
was
something
more
common
in
the
due
course
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
then,
when
he
went
in
to
the
enlisted
reserve
and
they
serve
him
with
this
notice,
he
made
an
application
--
he
got
then
a
--
he
got
then
an
undesirable
discharge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
did
he
have
a
hearing
of
any
kind
before
that
was
issued?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
did
he
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
you
call
the
demurrer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
for
the
purposes
of
the
case,
he
in
effect
admitted
for
the
purpose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
thats
is
the
charges.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
he
filed
an
application
apparently
for
a
correction
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
the
piece
of
paper
itself
with
the
undesirable
discharge,
where
do
you
find
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
by
referring
to
any
of
those
hieroglyphics
there,
can
you
there
refer
the
security
--
security
discharge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
ar
604-10?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
argument
come
down
to
this
of
the
statute
that
you
say
we
should
construe
it
as
not
relating
to
preinduction
or
pre-enlistment
activity?
justice
john
m.
harlan
whatever
of
their
nature.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
in
substance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
if
the
army
had
information
to
the
man
who's
engaging
espionage
activities,
for
example,
before
his
induction,
they'd
still
have
to
give
him
an
honorable
discharge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
having
taken
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
give
him
an
honorable
discharge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
you
haven't
addressed
yourself
to?
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
--
making
rules
of
the
governance
of
the
armed
forces,
what
oration
is
a
man's
preinduction
activities
got
to
the
character
of
the
discharge
that
he
is
given
on
leaving
the
army?
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
the
point
of
view
of
making
rules
with
the
government
of
the
armed
forces,
what
is
the
relationship
of
a
man's
preinduction
activities
that
is
before
he
got
into
the
army,
what
relation
does
that
got
to
the
governance
of
the
armed
forces
as
regard
to
character
of
the
certificate
of
discharge
that
he's
been
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
has
been
suggested
here,
that
maybe
he
wants
to
reenlist
and
therefore,
he
ought
to
--
the
army
ought
to
know
and
have
a
ready
piece
of
paper
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
shows
what
kind
of
a
fellow
he
is
when
he
applies
for
reenlistment,
that's
what
--
what
are
some
of
the
considerations,
what
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
but
isn't
the
purpose
of
the
discharge,
not
to
give
a
fellow
a
five-day
to
(inaudible)
or
something
else
just
to
show
that
he's
out
of
the
army.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean,
to
give
him
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
maybe
the
fellow
who
has
a
bad
preinduction
record,
from
that
point
of
view,
did
a
splendid
job
in
the
army.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
the
question
i
was
asking.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
question
i
was
asking
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
relationship
has
the
--
has
his
preinduction
activity
got
to
his
--
to
his
service
in
the
army?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
that
we
disagree
with
you
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
--
one
question?
do
you
consider
this
from
a
far
reaching
case
from
the
government's
point
of
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
forget
about
the
civil
courts
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you
is
this.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
department
of
justice
by
the
army
that
unless
you
could
win
this
case,
i'm
putting
it
in
substance,
on
the
basis
of
your
jurisdictional
point,
you
had
to
advice
the
army
that
they
had
no
business
to
issue
certificates
other
than
certificates
of
honorable
discharge,
where
the
events
on
which
they
rely
were
totally
--
totally
before
the
man
was
inducted
into
the
army.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
certificate
that
indicates
that
he
was
discharged
for
security
reasons.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
are
separate
pieces,
separate
documents
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
the
basic
statute
of
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
regulations
covering
these
different
categories
of
discharges
printed
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
we
get
that
one,
i
have
been
looking
for
it
and
can't
find
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
seems
to
me
that's
the
bottom
of
your
whole
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
doesn't
govern
this
case,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
pardon
me,
that's
the
one
that's
printed
in
page
52
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
is
that
right?
