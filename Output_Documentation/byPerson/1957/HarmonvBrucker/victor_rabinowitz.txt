mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
somewhat
similar
to
those
in
harmon,
but
the
facts,
i
think
are
in
some
respects
materially
different
and
i
believe
the
issues
are
posed
somewhat
more
shortly.
in
1951,
at
the
age
of
21,
the
petitioner
was
drafted
into
the
army.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
1951,
when
he
was
21
years
old.
from
may
1952
to
may
1953,
he
saw
active
service
as
an
artilleryman
on
the
korean
battlefront.
and
as
a
result
of
his
services,
he
was
awarded
the
korean
service
medal
and
the
united
nations
service
medal.
on
june
30,
1953,
he
received
an
honorable
separation
from
the
active
service.
and
pursuant
to
the
statute,
he
was
transferred
to
the
enlisted
reserves.
he
returned
to
his
civilian
life
and
took
up
the
education
that
had
been
interrupted
by
his
induction.
two
years
later,
he
received
from
the
army
a
letter
of
allegations
charging
that
before
his
induction,
he
had
engaged
in
political
activity
of
the
nature
that
the
court
is
well
familiar
with,
specifically
it
was
charged
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
when
he
was
18
or
19
years
old,
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
labor
youth
league
when
he
was
16
or
17
years
old,
and
that
he
had
subscribed
to
the
work
and
he's
been
a
member
of
some
other
organization
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing
before
an
army
field
board.
he
did
not
accept
that
opportunity.
in
effect,
he
demurred,
saying
that
as
he
understood
his
rights,
the
army
had
no
right,
constitutional,
statutory
or
in
any
other
way
to
take
action
against
him
now
on
the
basis
of
lawful
pre-induction
civilian
activity.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
army
notified
him
two
year
--
in
1955,
which
was
two
years
after
he
had
received
an
honorable
separation
from
the
armed
forces.
he
was
still
in
the
reserves.
and
on
the
13th
day
of
september,
he
received
a
certificate
suitable
in
form
but
not
in
content
of
discharge,
which
says
in
large
letters,
undesirable
discharge
from
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
and
in
somewhat
smaller
letters
ar
604-10,
which
is
the
security,
loyalty
regulation
of
the
army,
ar
604-10
applies.
he
brought
an
action
in
the
district
court,
lost.
the
court
below
saying
merely
in
a
single
sentence,
it
had
no
authority
to
review
the
action
of
the
army.
he
then
appealed
and
the
case
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
a
few
weeks
after
harmon.
and
the
panel
that
heard
the
case
said
that
it
felt
that
it
was
bound
by
harmon.
one
of
the
judges,
judge
bazelon,
who
had
dissented
in
harmon
said,
that
if
you
were
free
to
consider
the
case
again,
he
would
dissent
again.
and
a
second
of
the
judges,
judge
fahy
said
that
if
he
were
free
to
consider
the
question
anew,
he
would
like
to
consider
it
anew.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
there
was
no
opinion
by
the
district
judge
and
no
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals
either
except
saying
that
it
is
deciding
the
case
on
the
authority
upon
it.
the
position
taken
by
the
government
here
is
much
the
same
position
as
that
taken
below,
and
it
is
no
accident
that
the
appropriate
regulations
were
not
printed
in
the
record
or
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
harmon
case
or
in
this
case,
because
the
government's
theory
is
that
it
never
reaches
that
question.
it
is
not
just
a
fortuitous
matter
involved
with
who
wrote
the
brief
that
the
government
took
this
extreme
position
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
the
position
that
judge
black
and
justice
brennan
mentioned,
namely
that
no
matter
what
the
army
does
with
respect
to
a
discharge,
it
cannot
be
reviewed.
that
is
not
an
accident
because
that
is
precisely
the
argument
and
exactly
that
same
bold
form
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
that
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
having
prevailed
in
those
two
courts.
it
is
made
here
in
the
boldest
possible
form
namely
that
when
the
army
issues
a
discharge,
be
it
in
violation
of
statute,
be
it
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
be
it
in
violation
of
anything.
a
civil
court
has
no
right
to
review.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
very
well
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
very
well,
sir,
i'll
accept
that
--
that
this
court
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
court
doesn't
determine
whether
the
action
of
the
army
is
constitutional
or
not.
that
determination
is
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
army.
that
is
the
government's
position.
the
secretary
of
the
army
having
made
this
determination,
no
civil
court
can
review
it.
now,
im
not
going
to
argue
against
that
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
know
whether
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
but
--
very
well,
very
well,
sir.
i
think
that
in
this
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
--
well,
i
don't
think
i'm
inaccurate,
sir.
so
far
as
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
the
government
contends
that
a
court
has
no
right
to
review.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
i
accept
it.
i've
accepted
that
modification.
the
government
contends
that
no
court
has
the
right
to
review
its
activities
whether
they
be
in
violation
of
statute
or
not.
now,
i
contend
that
there
is
no
authority
for
that
extreme
position
that
this
court
has,
on
frequent
occasions,
reviewed
the
action
of
the
army
in
habeas
corpus
cases
for
example
and
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
brief
that
the
government
has
reviewed
the
action
of
all
other
arms
of
the
government
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
beyond
(inaudible)
case,
and
that
there
is
no
justification
in
our
constitutional
scheme.
and
no
suggestion
in
the
law
that
says
that
the
army
is
above
review
by
the
courts
and
that
the
army,
i
believe,
alone
of
all
of
the
agencies
of
the
government
is
not
subject
to
review
on
constitutional
grounds
by
the
district
courts
and
ultimately
by
this
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
of
course
not.
and
i
think
that
justice
frankfurter
in
the
memorandum
filed
in
the
burns
against
wilson
pointed
out
that
due
process
in
an
army
is
not
anything
like
or
may
not,
maybe
quite
different
from
due
process
in
civilian
life.
and
that
there
are
many
rights
that
a
soldier
does
not
have
that
a
civilian
does
have.
but
there
are
standards
in
both
the
army,
there
maybe
different
standards
but
there
are
standards
in
both
which
i
submit
a
court
and
this
court
has
ultimately
a
right
to
review.
because
the
government
takes
this
position,
as
i
say,
it
never
reaches
the
question
of
whether
the
regulations
are
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
and
therefore,
i
found
it
unnecessary
to
refer
to
the
regulations
in
any
extent
in
its
brief.
the
second
position
taken
by
the
government
is
that
there
is
no
justiciable
controversy
here.
and
there
is
no
justiciable
controversy
because
the
petitioner
has
not
been
injured.
there
is
no
significant
injury
here.
well,
i
don't
believe
that
that
argument
had
any
place
in
harmon
but
it
certainly
has
no
place
in
this
case,
because
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
legal
rights
between
an
employ
--
between
a
soldier
who
has
an
honorable
discharge
and
a
soldier
who
has
an
undesirable
discharge.
in
my
reply
brief,
i
have
set
forth
as
an
appendix
a
chart.
this
is
a
chart
that
was
submitted
to
a
congressional
committee
by
secretary
of
defense
wilson.
and
it
sets
forth
all
of
the
benefits
to
which
shows
soldiers
are
entitled
depending
on
whether
their
discharge
is
honorable,
general,
undesirable,
a
bad
conduct,
dishonorable
and
so
forth.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
chart
is
in
appendix
8
of
the
reply
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner.
and
your
honors
will
know
that
there
are
a
number
of
benefits
listed
to
which
a
soldier
with
an
honorable
discharge
is
entitled,
to
which
a
soldier
with
an
undesirable
discharge
is
not
eligible
and
there
are
many
benefits.
in
fact,
all
of
the
benefits
that
are
administered
by
the
veterans
administration
to
which
a
soldier
with
an
honorable
discharge
is
eligible
as
a
matter
of
rank,
but
a
soldier
with
an
undesirable
discharge
is
entitled
only
after
agency
review
of
the
facts,
presumably
as
a
matter
of
agency
discretion.
now,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
being
entitled,
for
example,
to
hospitalization
benefits
or
a
veteran's
pension,
or
other
veteran's
rights,
as
a
matter
of
right
and
being
entitled
to
them
only
after
the
exercise
of
agency
discretion
especially
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
extraordinarily
sympathetic
action
by
the
agency
is
not
likely
to
be
unaccountable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
army
in
its
regulation,
the
navy
in
its
regulations
and
the
air
force
in
its
regulations,
all
point
out
that
an
undesirable
discharge
will
result
in
very
serious
injury
to
the
man
who
receives
it.
and
that
a
soldier
who
gets
an
undesirable
discharge
may
expect
to
encounter
very
serious
handicaps
in
his
civilian
life
in
any
case
in
which
the
character
of
a
discharge
is
important.
and
if
that
is
true
of
an
undesirable
discharge,
generally,
it
is
particularly
true
of
an
undesirable
discharge
which
is
not
granted
pursuant
to
the
army's
loyalty
security
regulations.
it
means
government
employment
is
closed
to
him
forever.
it
means
that
most
large
employers
or
many
large
employers
will
not
employ
him.
it
means
that
in
the
case
of
a
professional
as
of
the
case
of
the
petitioner
here,
his
opportunities
for
employment
are
very,
very,
sharply
curtailed.
and
defense
department
representatives
have
admitted
this
very
thing
in
government
in
congressional
hearings.
mr.
fenton
appearing
as
a
representative
of
the
--
of
the
defense
department
said
that
the
consequences
of
an
undesirable
discharge
are
indeed
deep.
it
was
the
word
that
he
used.
more
than
any
of
these
or
perhaps
a
part
of
all
of
this
is
what
this
court
has
referred
to
as
the
badge
of
infamy
that
is
placed
on
any
person
who
in
these
days
is
ranked
as
being
suspect
for
one
reason
or
another
with
the
possibility
that
he
has
at
one
time
or
another
engaged
in
subversive
activity
and
to
say
that
this
is
so
trivial.
this
is
so
unimportant
that
it
does
not
even
give
a
man
a
right
to
come
into
court
and
seek
judicial
relief
is
i
think
contrary
to
bank,
contrary
to
life
and
it's
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
done.
and
he
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
was
in
the
inactive
reserve.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
in
actual
fact,
his
only
obligation
was
to
respond
if
the
president
should
call
him
and
the
president
has
a
right
to
call
the
inactive
reserve
in
time
of
war
or
grave
national
emergency,
that
did
not
happen
nor
has
it
happened
since
the
close
of
the
war
and
he
was
for
all
intents
and
purposes
a
civilian.
he
did
not
have
to
report.
he
did
not
have
to
undergo
any
training.
he
didn't
have
to
do
anything.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
his
party
membership
is
not
admitted,
that
was
a
demur
in
effect.
the
membership
was
alleged
to
have
been
in
1948
and
1949
i
think
or
1949
and
1950
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
had
an
opportunity
to
go
to
a
hearing.
the
army
offered
him
a
hearing.
he
declined
the
hearing
saying
that
the
charges
would
not
--
would
not
be
sufficient,
even
if
it's
true.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
charge
--
there
is
no
finding.
the
charge
is
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1948
and
1949.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
all
of
this
was
pre-induction.
there
is
no
charge
at
all
of
any
activity
after
his
induction
into
the
army.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
there
were
other
charges.
party
membership
in
1948
and
1949,
a
member
of
the
labor
youth
league
which
is
identified
as
an
organization
cited
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
as
a
communist
front
from
1949
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
appears
at
page
6
of
the
record.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
in
1948,
he
was
17
years
old.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
1948
and
1949,
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
got
an
--
well,
it
is
called
an
honorable
separation
and
it
doesn't
result
in
a
certificate
like
this
that
results
in
one
of
those
forms
dd-214
that
was
referred
to
before.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that's
right.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
was
offered
a
hearing.
he
was
given
an
alternative.
they
said
either
you
can
have
a
hearing
or
you
can
respond
in
writing
or
you
can
retire.
you
can
resign.
you
can
give
up
your
right
place
in
the
reserves
except
that
if
you
give
up
your
place
in
the
reserves,
you're
going
to
get
an
undesirable
discharge.
so
he
was
given
three
alternatives.
they
--
they
are
--
they
appear
at
pages
8
and
9
of
the
record.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
chose
the
second
of
the
alternatives
namely
to
respond
in
writing
and
his
response
in
writing,
that's
what
appears
at
pages
8
and
9
of
the
record.
his
response
in
writing
says
that
the
allegations
since
they
were
allegations
of
lawful
political
activity
prior
to
discharge
would
not
justify
an
undesirable
--
prior
to
induction.
i'm
sorry.
it
would
not
justify
an
action,
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
army.
and
therefore,
he
chose
not
to
respond
in
any
way.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
what
i
call
in
effect
a
demurrer.
he
said
even
if
the
charges
were
true,
it
would
not
justify
the
granting
of
any
kind
of
an
undesirable
discharge
by
the
army
because
my
military
service
was
honorable.
i
received
an
honorable
separation
from
the
armed
forces
and
all
of
this
is
pre-induction.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
purposes
of
the
--
well,
the
purpose
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
for
purposes
of
the
case
as
any
demurrer,
i
say
this
would
be
an
admission.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
yes.
he
went
through
the
administrative
procedures
in
the
army
which
are
prerequisites
to
the
bringing
of
the
lawsuit
or
at
least
for
the
court.
he
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies
to
use
the
usual
expression
and
having
done
that
he
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
two
years
--
between
two
years.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understood
the
question.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
normally
there
is
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
on
the
current
practice,
you
don't
get
a
discharge
until
you
have
finished
your
service
in
the
reserves.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
which
is
i
think
six
years
after
your
separation
from
active
service.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
so
there
is
a
six-year
lapse
normally.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
appears
at
record,
page
10.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
suggest
that
any
personnel
officer,
any
civil
service
commission,
any
veteran's
administration
representative,
anybody
who
is
knowledgeable
in
these
things
would
recognize
that
as
being
the
army
loyalty
security
regulation.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
--
that
appears
incidentally
in
the
petitioner's
brief
as

and
that
regulation
as
your
honors
will
see
is
what
may
be
characterized
as
a
typical
loyalty
security
regulation.
it
sets
forth
a
series
of
criteria
and
standard
which
begin
at
page
40
of
the
appendix.
among
the
criteria
that
are
listed
are
a
number
of
standards
beginning
at
page
41
which
are
contained
language
which
is
characteristic
of
all
loyalty,
security
and
regulations.
the
word
subversive
appears
in
substantially
every
one
of
these
criteria
that
becomes
a
sin
or
at
least
a
criteria
to
establish
or
continue
a
sympathetic
association
with
anybody
who
--
any
representative
of
foreign
nation
or
whose
interest
maybe
in
amicable
to
the
united
states
or
any
person
who
advocates
the
use
of
force
or
violence.
it
refers
to
membership
in
or
affiliation
or
sympathetic
association
with
any
subversive
organization.
it
refers
to
participation
in
the
activities
of
an
organization
as
a
front
for
a
subversive
organization.
generally
speaking,
it
contains
the
usual
kind
of
criteria
which
we
find
in
a
much
more
--
much
more
extreme
form
than
this
court
for
example
discussed
in
the
watkins
and
sweezy
cases
where
there
were
some
discussions
of
the
use
of
the
word
like
un-american
and
subversive.
clearly,
this
regulation
is
so
vague
that
it
could
not
possibly
have
given
notice
to
anyone
as
to
what
activities
he
could
have
engaged
in
lawfully.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
may
i
just
finish
the
sentence?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
notice
wouldn't
have
been
any
good
even
if
it
had
been
cleared
because
this
regulation
wasn't
passed
until
long
after
this
man
was
inducted
into
the
army.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
we
have
here
--
briefly
at
this
point,
a
situation
in
which
a
young
man
is
inducted
into
the
army,
not
at
his
request,
serves
under
fire
for
a
year
for
which
he
receives
service
medals
and
an
honorable
separation,
returns
to
civilian
life
and
two
years
later
is
inflicted
with
a
very
grievous
injury
because
he
has
alleged
to
have
engaged
in
lawful
political
activity
before
his
induction
into
the
army,
before
the
regulation,
which
is
applicable
to
him
was
passed
on
the
basis
of
a
regulation
which,
i
submit,
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
all
of
this
in
an
area
involving
very
fundamental
first
amendment
freedom.
the
implications
of
this
are
extremely
broad,
it
is
in
this
record,
but
the
fact
is,
that
the
army
claims
the
right,
also,
to
give
an
undesirable
discharge
because
of
political
activities
engaged
in
by
a
man
after
his
separation
from
the
service
during
the
six
years
of
his
service
in
the
inactive
reserves
and
there
are
such
cases
that
are
now
administratively
pending.
this
means
that
the
united
states
army,
if
this
be
a
valid
procedure,
is
given
the
right
to
censor
the
activities
of
substantially
every
young
man
in
the
united
states
up
to
about
the
age
of
30.
they
have
the
right
to
investigate,
look
at
those
activities
and
if
they
are
contrary
to
this
regulation
or
any
successive
regulation,
to
punish
him,
to
give
him
an
undesirable
discharge
because
those
activities
are
activities
of
which
the
army
does
not
approve.
and
this
is
a
most
stringent
form
of
censorship.
i
can't
think
of
no
agency
of
the
united
states
government
that
is
less
qualified
to
carry
on
this
function
than
the
united
states
army
because,
certainly,
there
is
nothing
in
the
training
of
the
army,
nothing
in
the
tradition
of
the
army,
that
gives
it
the
right
to
determine
whether
certain
political
activities
are
to
be
approved
or
disapproved.
to
say
that
this
raises
serious
constitutional
questions
is,
i
think,
an
understatement.
before
we
get
to
the
constitutional
issues
involved,
however,
because
i
know
that
this
court
would,
as
always,
prefer
not
to
have
to
pass
on
them,
let
us
see
what
is
the
statutory
authority
for
this
extremely
broad
assertion
of
authority.
let
me
say
preliminarily
that
although
we
have
had
an
army
in
this
country
since,
i
suppose,
1775
and
the
articles
of
war,
as
mr.
macguineas
has
said,
have
been
in
existence
since
the
continental
congress
passed
them
and
although
our
army
has
operated
for
almost
two
centuries
now,
all
during
this
period
of
time,
it
has
generally
been
regarded
that
a
discharge
is
to
be
determined,
it
is
a
reflection,
it
is
a
judgment
in
the
words
of
this
court,
a
judgment
on
a
man's
military
service,
not
on
what
he
did
before
he
got
in
to
the
army
or
what
he
did
after
he
was
in
the
army,
but
a
judgment
on
his
military
service.
it
is
a
final
statement.
this
man
has
served
honorably.
this
man
has
not
served
honorably.
now
we
had
a
sharp
break
with
that
history.
we
have
an
assertion
by
the
army
of
the
broadest
kind
of
power,
of
power
to
determine
and
to
visit,
as
i
said,
extreme
penalty
on
persons
who
do
not
live
up
to
its
standard
of
what
is
proper
political
conduct.
now
if,
as
i
say,
the
army
had
statutory
power
to
do
this,
we
would
have
to
face
the
constitutional
question.
but
what
is
statutory
power
to
do
it?
all
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
two
statutes
phrased
in
the
most
general
language
and
which
appear
at
page
two
of
petitioner's
brief.
one
is
the
act
of
may
5th,
1950
which
says
that
any
enlisted
--
all
enlisted
persons
who
are
discharged
from
the
united
states
service
--
military
service
of
the
united
states
shall
get
a
discharge
and
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
shall
prescribe
the
manner
for
such
discharge.
i'm
sorry.
there
are,
perhaps,
three
sections.
the
second
one,
section
248
of
the
armed
forces
reserve
act
of
1952
which
says
that
the
discharge
of
members
of
the
reserve
shall
be
in
accordance
with
regulations.
and
finally,
the
last
section
set
forth
at
the
bottom
page
2
which
says
that
if
a
man
gets
less
than
an
honorable
discharge
and
undesirable
discharge,
as
in
this
case,
it
shall
be
pursuant
to
the
approved
finding
of
a
board
of
officers.
nothing
in
here
that
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
army
a
general
political
censorship
that
the
congress
intended
by
these
statutes
to
make
that
break
with
history
and
to
give
to
the
army
the
power
to
exert
this
vast
censorship
over
30
years
of
a
young
man's
life.
this
is
an
extreme
power
indeed.
personally,
i
doubt
whether
congress
would
have
the
constitutional
power
to
give
the
united
states
army
that
right,
i
don't
believe
congress
has
the
power
to
give
anybody
that
right,
but
certainly
in
our
system
of
government,
not
the
united
states
army.
but
if
congress
did
intend
to
give
congress
that
right,
it
seems
to
me
the
--
that
the
least
that
could
be
required
under
these
circumstances
is
for
congress
to
say
so.
and
for
congress
to
give
to
the
army
the
right
to
make
political
tests,
to
impose
those
political
tests
on
a
man's
preinduction
activity
and
not
nearly
repeat,
which
in
substance,
it
has
done
here
the
language
of
statutes
which
in
one
form
or
another
had
been
in
effect
in
the
united
states
since
1775
and
in
england,
before
that
time.
this
is
a
great
and
important
power
which
the
army
is
here
contending
for.
if
it
has
that
right
as
a
matter
of
statute,
somewhere,
there
should
be
statute
that
says
so.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
i
should
think
it
should
not
be
related
to
first
amendment
activity
at
all.
but,
certainly,
for
the
sake
of
my
case,
let
us
say,
preinduction
activity.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
they
don't
want
to
take
him,
they
don't
have
to.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
certainty.
if
a
man
engage
--
if
a
man
is
guilty
of
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
if
a
man
is
guilty
of
robbery,
or
rape,
or
murder,
or
anything
else
before
he
gets
in
to
the
army
and
the
army
takes
him,
he
gets
--
he
gets
an
honorable
discharge,
if
his
service
has
been
honorable.
if
he's
guilty
of
espionage,
obviously,
he
should
be
indicted.
he
should
be
convicted
and
punished
accordingly.
if,
merely,
some
officer
of
the
army
suspects
that
he
maybe
engaged
in
espionage
and
if
the
united
states
attorney
does
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
proceed
on
that,
the
man
is
entitled
to
an
honorable
discharge
if
his
service
is
honorable.
what
--
how
he
has
to
answer
to
the
civilian
authorities
is
a
matter
for
the
civilian
authorities
to
determine
and
not
for
the
united
states
army.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
is
the
practice
of
the
army.
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
on
it
but
i
do
know
the
case
--
i
do
know
of
this
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
merely
that
--
in
discussing
this
with
members
of
--
of
--
with
representatives
of
the
army,
and
i
come
to
many
of
them
in
the
course
of
this
litigation,
they
have
so
advised
me.
there
are
cases
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
about
something
--
oh,
i
suppose
it
could
be
recorded
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
we
have
since
discovered
that
this
man
was
guilty
of
crimes
in
private
life
and
therefore,
we
don't
think
he
ought
to
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
thought
that
was
just
--
oh,
espionage?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
he
was
guilty
or
may
--
may
have
been
--
of
course
if
he
was
guilty
of
espionage.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
should
say
--
i
should
say
that
one
branch
of
the
army
would
have
the
right
to
advise
another
branch
of
the
army
that,
"we
don't
think
this
fellow
ought
to
be
taken
into
the
army
again
because
we
think
he
has
proclivities
in
this
direction.
in
any
event
we
don't
want
--
we
don't
want
to
take
the
chance."
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
on
dd
--
there
must
be
other
means
of
communication
within
the
army.
dd214
is
a
semipublic
document.
i
don't
believe
that
these
things
should
be
made
public
if
they're
intended
for
inner
army
consumption.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
constitutional
distinction
between
proclaiming
something
to
the
public
and
having
something
in
their
--
in
their
governmental
file,
just
as
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
so-called
unscreened
or
unevaluated
files
of
the
fbi
and
what
the
government
finds
as
a
matter
of
--
of
fact.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
know
this
problem
arises
and
i
don't
think
it
can
all
be
solved
in
a
sentence.
let
me
just
say
this,
sir.
i
do
know
that
there
are
cases
in
which
a
man
has
enlisted
in
the
army,
received
an
undesirable
discharge
then
accepted
for
reenlistment,
because
the
army
waived
the
undesirable
discharge,
and
at
the
close
of
his
second
enlistment,
if
his
service
was
honorable,
the
courts
had
held
the
--
or
the
adjutant
general
has
held
that
he
is
entitled
to
an
honorable
discharge
regardless
of
what
may
have
happened
in
the
course
of
his
first
enlistment.
i
believe
there
are
such
cases
cited
in
my
brief.
