the
lack
of
right
of
a
soldier
to
obey
the
order
of
his
commanding
officer,
would
you?
justice
charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
macguineas,
on
that
score,
let's
just
compare
was
the
calling
of
everyday
garden
variety
of
state
statutes
referring
the
giving
of
service
letters.
now,
there's
no
publication
in
the
sense
of
the
livelihood
law
when
the
employer
writes
the
letter
and
hands
it
to
the
employees,
as
the
statute
requires,
but
this
letter
must
to
restate
the
reason
for
the
separation
and
when
the
employee
goes
to
get
another
job,
he
asked
--
he's
asked
to
see
and
must
produce
slightly
or
he
won't
be
employed
to
the
service
letter.
did
not
--
did
not
in
the
--
it
comes
to
a
matter
on
the
service
letter
injure
him
and
give
him
standing
to
sue
damages
result?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
not
on
this
one?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
to
it
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
mr.
macguineas,
now
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you.
you
said
i
think
that
there
were
two
discharges
of
mr.
harmon.
well
now,
the
first
was
a
mere
transfer
to
another
department,
was
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
he
was
--
was
he
not
first
given
the
undesirable
discharge?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
this
--
this
man
got
first
an
undesirable
discharge,
then
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
discharge
was
administratively
changed
to
less
than
honorable
condition
or
to
do
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
an
honorable
condition.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right
now,
do
you
not
then
say
that
the
first
discharge
was
under
army
directive
number
5210.9,
which
was
before
the
formation
of
the
formal
regulations
on
april
10,
1954
which
became
regulation
604.10?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
only
the
directive
which
was
5210.9
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
now,
and
then
at
the
time
of
the
discharge,
the
first
one
under
which
the
undesirable
discharge
was
given,
the
long
fact
was
the
act
of
1920
and
the
directive
number
5210.9.
at
the
time
of
the
second
discharge
which
was
the
one
under
honorable
conditions,
the
army
had
formulated
its
formal
regulations
and
they
were
604.10,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
did
it
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
by
the
law
as
it
existed
and
the
regulations
as
they
existed
when
they
separated
from
the
service,
not
when
they
gave
him
the
second
discharge.
