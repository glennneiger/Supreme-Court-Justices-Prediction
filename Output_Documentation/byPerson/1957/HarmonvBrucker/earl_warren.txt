mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shapiro,
suppose
--
suppose
the
man
is
a
company
director
as
certified
by
his
company
commander,
he
was
excellent
in
this
case.
suppose
on
the
outside
(inaudible)
referred
to
or
some
other
crime,
can
they
discharge
the
mere
fact
of
his
company
conduct,
he's
excellent,
compel
them
to
give
him
an
honorable
discharge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
whether
that's
pertinent
thereafter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
--
do
you
claim
also,
mr.
shapiro,
that
having
serve
in
the
army
he
is
in
--
if
he
served
honorably
and
well
that
he's
entitled
to
the
status
of
honorably
discharge
soldier
of
the
united
states
army.
chief
justice
earl

oh,
yes,
of
course.

versus

mr.
rabinowitz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
date
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
old
would
he
have
been
in
1948?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
when
he
was
alleged
to
have
been
a
member
of
the
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macguineas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macguineas,
before
you
get
into
that,
may
i
ask
this
question?
do
you
agree
that
--
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
service
conduct
or
character
for
this
man
at
that
time
which
bears
upon
this
dishonorable
discharge,
in
other
words,
that
it
is
all
preinduction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
by
--
and
by
that
you
mean
that
that's
all
you
and
the
army
rely
on
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
just
wanted
to
be
sure
of
that
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
he
did
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
was
in
the
army?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
you
arbitrarily
give
him
one
--
give
him
less
than
an
honorable
discharge
if
his
conduct
was
excellent
while
in
--
in
the
service
or
something
he
had
done
before
he
went
into
the
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
happen
to
remember
that
during
world
war
ii,
the
armed
forces
cooperated
with
prison
officials
in
the
--
the
various
states
of
the
union
in
such
a
manner
as
to
get
prisoners
for
very
serious
crimes
paroled
on
condition
that
they
go
into
the
armed
services.
i
happen
to
know
of
a
good
many
prisoners
who
were
accorded
that
treatment.
i
happen
also
to
know
of
a
good
many
of
them
who
came
back
with
honorable
discharges
but
i
want
to
ask
you
is,
could
the
army,
if
it
chose
to
do
so,
could
grant
less
than
an
honorable
discharge
to
one
of
those
men
whom
it
took
into
the
service
and
those
--
under
those
conditions
granted
that
he
had
served
excellently
while
in
the
army
and
that
his
character
while
in
the
army
was
excellent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
discharge
them.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it
a
little
broader
question
than
that
that
it
isn't
a
question
whether
they
can
--
can
give
him
a
discharge
which
records
other
than
the
--
his
actual
conduct
and
character
as
a
member
of
the
armed
forces?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
--
how
do
you
attach
that
to
this
young
man?
here,
you
have
a
young
man,
21
years
of
age,
he
--
he
served
honorably
in
the
war,
served
in
combat
and
was
discharged
and
given
--
given
the
accolade,
as
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
you
said.
and
then
the
army
comes
back
and
says
when
he
was
17
years
of
age
and
not
later
than
that,
he
was
in
some
communist
or
--
or
so-called,
communist
organizations
and
that
from
that
reason,
and
that
reason
alone,
he
must
be
given
an
undesirable
discharge.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
when
you
don't
carry
this
conduct
into
or
through
his
army
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
believe
the
counsel
contest
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
agree
that
you
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
discharge
him
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
any
time
he
wants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
(voice
overlap).
now,
wait
a
minute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wish
you
will
restate
that
please
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
a
confession
there
as
i
see
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
just
said
--
you
just
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
you
go
back
to
the
--
you
--
you
admit
that
and
then
go
back
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
then
that's
the
only
issue
you
have
in
the
case
of
--
if
you
lose
on
jurisdiction
then
you
concede
that
--
you
concede
that
the
petitioner
wins?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
taken
an
hour
and
a
half
almost,
to
the
argument
in
the
great
deal
of
cause
(inaudible)
to
--
to
--
for
us
to
ascertain
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macguiness,
i
think
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
get
in
writing
avouchment
from
the
solicitor
general
for
your
position
here
you've
stated,
and
i'm
sure
you've
state
it
frankly
and
you
may
--
you
may
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
be
required
to
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
you
will
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
calls
for
any
response?
mr.
abramowitz,
you
may
of
course
respond
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
--
as
i
said
to
you
a
moment
ago
the
--
the
court
does
not
call
for
a
written
avouchment
for
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
versus
wilber
m.
brucker,
individually
and
as
--
of
the
army.
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
macguineas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macguineasm,
you
minimize
the
difference
between
this
discharge
and
an
honorable
discharge
and
i
think
it
strange
that
mr.
shapiro
would
--
would
urge
that
there
is
a
great
difference.
what
is
the
difference
and
--
and
why
do
you
have
the
two
--
two
forms
of
discharge
if
you
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wait
a
minute.
do
they
--
they
served
under
honorable
condition,
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
it
--
do
both
of
them
mean
that
he
served
honorably?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
both
of
them
say
that
he
served
honorably
while
in
the
armed
forces?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
were
--
you
were
trying
to
minimize
the
difference
between
these
two
discharges.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
does
the
general
discharge
import
that
he
served
honorably
in
the
army?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
percentages
of
--
of
discharge
servicemen
get
the
accolade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
place
in
the
--
in
the
briefs,
i
--
i
thought
i
saw
that
95%
of
all
servicemen
received
the
accolade,
is
that
--
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
they
--
but
they
don't
say
in
percentages.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
--
is
that
approximately
true
that
95%
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
what
approximation
will
get
a
dishonorable
discharge
or
a
bad
discharge
of
any
kind,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
must
be
a
sizable
number,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
the
point
--
point
is
simply
this
that
in
my
mind,
that
if
95%
get
an
honorable
discharge,
what
you
call
the
accolade,
and
a
large
number
of
them
get
dishonorable
discharges
and
--
and
discharges
below
even
the
one
that
this
man
got,
the
number
of
this
kind
of
discharges
is
apparently
very
small,
is
very,
very
small.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
all
right.
now
--
now
why
--
why
would
that
small
number
of
men
be
--
be
denied
the
honorable
discharge?
i
just
want
to
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
--
what
caused
it
and
why
you
do
it
and
what
the
necessity
for
--
for
the
two
different
kinds
are
if
you
want
the
public
to
believe
that
this
general
discharge
is
the
equivalent
of
an
honorable
discharge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
--
do
you
quote
the
--
the
regulation
under
which
the
general
discharge
is
issued?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not?
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
a
very
important
thing
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
you
read
it
to
us
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
to
me
it's
very
important
to
know
if
you've
got
a
regulation
for
--
for
an
honorable
discharge
and
another
regulation
for
a
general
discharge
and
you're
claiming
that
he's
only
entitled
to
a
general
discharge,
and
the
other
side
is
claiming
he
is
entitled
to
an
honorable
discharge,
seems
to
me
elementary
that
should
--
it
had
both
those
regulations
in
this
--
in
this
record
some
place
where
we
could
--
where
we
could
read
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
it
printed,
mr.
--
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
very
vital
elementary
in
this
case.
why
shouldn't
we
have
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
â€“
is
that
always
a
statement
of
that
kind
always
preclude
judicial
review?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
true
even
though
his
character
is
rated
as
excellent
and
his
performance
is
rated
as
excellent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
tell
me
please
how
you
justify
that
under
this
regulation
eight
as
it
appears
on
page
52
and
regulation
nine
as
it
appears
on
page
53
of
the
brief
for
petitioner
which
you
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
you
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
not
in
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
it
in
the
brief?
i
ask
you
once
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
about
each
of
these
because
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
so
unusual
that
the
government
would
not
print
in
its
--
in
its
briefs
a
statute
that
it
wants
us
to
rely
upon
in
a
case
of
this
--
case
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
regulations,
yes.
we
can
get
the
statutes
very
easily
but
the
regulations
are
a
little
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
difficult
to
get.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
really
is
a
brief
without
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
it
--
those
are
the
things
you
rely
upon
with
your
offices.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
think
you
take
some
comfort
in
that.
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
interested
in
the
first
one
too
so
i
suggest
that
you
tell
us
what
was
in
existence
when
the
first
one
came
up
and
then
what
was
in
existence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
33
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
had
he
--
had
this
man
been
dismissed
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
--
you
said
you
were
going
to
take
it
chronologically
and
--
and
there
were
only
--
only
these
two,
eight
and
nine
of
the
regulations
plus
this
directive
at
the
time
he
was
discharged.
the
time
he
got
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
undesirable
discharge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
mr.
macguineas,
i
--
i
--
under
those
circumstances,
i
can't
get
away
from
--
from
number
8,
regulation
8
of
52
of
petitioner's
brief
and
regulation
9
on
the
next
page.
now,
8
says
that
except
as
provided
in
these
regulations
and
pertinent
regulations
listed
in
paragraph
three,
an
honorable
discharge
certificate
will
be
furnished
when
the
individual
meets
the
following
qualifications.
one,
as
character
ratings
of
at
least
very
good.
has
efficiency
ratings
of
at
least
excellent.
three,
has
not
been
convicted
by
a
general
court
martial,
and
four,
has
not
been
convicted
more
than
once
by
a
special
court
martial.
now,
number
9
says,
general
discharge,
individuals
discharged
under
honorable
conditions
which
do
not
qualify
them
for
an
honorable
discharge
will
be
furnished
a
general
discharge
except
as
provided
below
and
then
below
they
make
exceptions
where
they
can
even
give
them
a
general
--
an
honorable
discharge
under
those
circumstances.
now,
i
want
you
if
you
will
please,
to
read
me
the
language
of
any
statute
which
govern
his
case
at
the
time
he
was
released
from
service
in
the
army.
you
say
it
isn't
relevant,
the
kind
of
discharge
he
got
when
he
was
separated
from
the
service,
but
i
want
to
know
what
conditions
--
under
what
conditions
he
was
discharged
and
i
want
to
know
the
statutory
or
regulatory
power
that
you
rely
on
to
vary
these
two
regulations.
now,
read
it
to
me
please
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
i
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
have
it
in
my
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
23.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
what
--
what
does
that
statute
refer
to
other
than
regulation
8
under
for
honorable
discharges
and
regulation
nine
regulating
general
discharges,
what
--
what
in
the
regulations
vary
from
those
two
sections?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
he
was
separated
from
the
service.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
what
did
--
what
did
that
--
what
language
do
you
rely
on
as
varying
this
number
nine,
so
as
to
warrant
the
department
of
the
army
giving
him
a
general
instead
of
an
honorable
discharge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
want
to
hear
the
language.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
where
in
the
--
what
in
the
regulations
do
you
rely
on,
please
read
me
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here's
a
man
who
had
no
physical
weakness,
it's
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
he
did
have
an
excellent
character
and
had
an
excellent
performance
record
according
to
the
records
of
the
army.
now,
what
is
it
that
shows
---
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you
can
give
a
man
of
that
kind
less
than
an
honorable
discharge
which
you
give
to
95%
of
all
the
men
who
go
through
the
