mr.
engene
l.
grimm
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
on
april
30,
1956,
federal
agents
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia
received
a
tip
from
an
informant
that
petitioner
had
installed
a
distillery
in
his
farmhouse.
he
had
--
he
had
previously
had
experience
along
that
line
and
so
the
agents
proceeded
to
his
farmhouse,
to
the
vicinity
thereof
to
investigate
the
situation.
they
found
spent
mash
running
from
a
rubber
hose
into
a
small
river,
in
a
hollow
behind
the
farmhouse
and
traces
to
within
approximately
50
yards
of
the
house.
the
following
day,
which
is
may
1st,
1956,
they
again
returned
to
the
vicinity.
they
found
at
that
time,
spent
mash
was
once
again
running
into
the
stream.
they
could
smell
the
odor
of
cooking
mash
in
the
area.
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
blower
burner
in
operation.
here,
i
might
say
that
a
blower
burner
is
used
to
transmit
fuel
oil
to
the
boiler,
which
generates
steam
and
steam
is
then
in
turn
used
in
distillation
process.
they
also
heard
voices
and
bumping
noises
and
continued
their
surveillance
at
that
time
until
about
2:00
a.m.on
the
morning
of
may
2nd.
so,
as
of
that
time,
the
agents
knew
that
a
distillery
was
in
operation
within
the
farmhouse
and
they
knew
that
several
persons
were
involved,
because
for
--
from
time
to
time
they
could
see
people
moving
around
the
premises.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
not
so
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
i
believe
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
i
believe
andersonville,
georgia.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
it
was
a
drive
for
the
federal
officers
of
about
30
to
45
minutes,
each
way.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
they
had
one
car
for
the
five.
they
were
five
in
the
group.
i
--
i'd
like
to
say
on
page
40
of
the
record,
state
agent
hollingsworth
is
testifying
and
he
testified,
it
took
30
to
45
minutes
to
drive
out
there.
later
on
that
day
of
may
2nd,
in
the
afternoon,
the
agents
procured
a
daytime
search
warrant
and
proceeded
in
a
party
of
five
again
to
the
vicinity
of
the
farmhouse.
they
arrived
there
in
about
an
hour
before
darkness.
it
was
a
gray
overcast
the
day.
they
took
up
a
position
in
a
small
grove
across
the
road
from
petitioner's
farmhouse.
and
the
agent
in
charge,
elect
in
charge
--
elected
to
continue
his
investigation
rather
than
serve
the
warrant
at
that
time.
he
testified
that
he
did
this
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
he
wanted
to
learn
whether
any
other
persons
were
implicated
in
the
operation
of
this
distillery.
he
wanted
to
learn
who
they
were
and
he
also
wanted
to
learn
whether
there
were
any
vehicles
involved.
it
began
to
rain
heavily
and
the
rain
slackened
off
then
at
about
7:00
p.m.
or
thereabout.
the
agents
heard
voices
from
the
farmhouse.
the
voices
inquired
whether
someone
would
like
to
bring
up
the
truck
at
that
time
and
an
unidentified
person
left
the
premises
and
went
down
to
the
home
of
petitioner's
father,
which
is
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
road.
thereafter,
a
truck
was
driven
into
the
farmyard
and
driven
around
behind
the
farmhouse,
out
of
sight
of
the
agents.
then,
the
agents
saw
people
moving
around
in
the
house
through
a
window,
a
lighted
window.
they
heard
heavy
bumping
noises,
as
though
heavy
objects
were
being
moved.
and
--
and
about
9:00
or
9:15
p.m.,
the
truck
motor
was
started
and
the
truck
began
to
drive
around
from
the
corner
of
the
farmhouse.
the
agents
then
began
to
move
across
the
road
and
as
the
truck
arrived
at
the
driveway
to
the
farmhouse
it
became
mired.
at
that
point,
the
agents
overtook
the
truck
and
they
arrested
two
persons
who
are
on
the
truck.
number
one,
james
mckinney,
who's
driving
the
truck
and
grady
jones,
the
brother
of
petitioner,
was
on
the
back.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
this
was
about
9:00
or
9:15
p.m.,
your
honor.
they
also
found
413
gallons
of
nontaxpaid
alcohol
on
the
truck.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
we
rely
upon
it,
only
insofar
that
it
contributes
to
the
entering
that
the
--
to
the
inference
that
the
agents
entered
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
arrest
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
searching
for
contraband,
having
made
the
--
as
i
will
say
later,
having
made
two
arrests,
having
known
that
several
persons
were
involved,
having
known
that
one
of
those
persons
was
petitioner,
he
not
having
been
on
the
truck
but
having
been
vitally
interested
of
course
in
the
removal
of
the
fruits
of
his
operation
from
the
premises.
we
think
that
we
have
reasonable
inference
that
the
agents
could
believe
that
he
was
therefore
in
the
house.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that
is
the
government's
contention,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not.
after
seized
--
after
making
the
arrest
on
the
truck
and
after
seizing
the
alcohol
on
the
truck,
the
agents
then
moved
to
both
the
front
and
back
door.
and
state
agent
hollingsworth,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
the
first
one
that
came
to
the
front
porch.
now,
while
they
were
making
the
arrest
at
the
truck,
an
unidentified
carrier
had
come
down
the
public
road,
turned
into
the
driveway
through
another
entrance
or
turned
into
the
farmyard
through
another
driveway.
and
so
when
agent
hollingsworth
arrived
at
the
front
porch,
he
found
petitioner's
wife
and
petitioner's
12-year-old
son
there
present.
now,
the
boy
was
standing
inside
the
doorway
and
he
was
holding
a
shotgun
at
point
arm.
hollingsworth
asked
him
to
hand
over
the
gun,
he
refused
to
do
so.
hollingsworth
then
asked
his
mother
to
tell
the
boy
to
hand
over
the
shotgun,
she
refused
to
do
so.
after
some
conversation
then,
hollingsworth
edged
closer
and
finally
succeeded
in
jumping
through
the
doorway
and
seizing
the
shotgun.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no,
sir,
but
the
district
court
expressly
found
in
its
findings
of
fact
that
the
first
entry
was
made
by
hollingsworth
for
the
purpose
of
disarming
the
boy.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that's
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
page
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
except
that
he
had
repeated
his
testimony,
but
that
is
the
only
expressed
statement
that
he
made.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
i
think
that
that
is
the
gist
of
his
entire
testimony.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
here,
i
should
point
out
that
earlier
in
his
testimony
--
testimony
hollingsworth
said.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
on
page
37.
"i
went
on
the
porch,
mr.
jones,
was
at
the
porch
--
on
the
porch
rather
and
as
i
run
upon
the
porch,
a
small
boy
there
grabbed
a
shotgun
and
held
it
up
more
or
less
as
at
port
arms
and
he
went
to
the
back."
that
is
from
front
to
back
to
the
house.
"i
hollered
to
woody
and
jim
that
he
was
coming
to
the
back
door
with
a
gun,
to
look
out."
and
after
he
went
to
the
backdoor,
i
told
mrs.jones,
"make
the
boy
put
the
gun
down."
and
she
says,
"i'm
not
going
to
do
it."
asked
for
a
search
warrant
and
i
told
her,
"we
didn't
need
a
search
warrant,"
and
the
kid
came
back
toward
me,
through
the
house
again
and
i
kept
telling
him,
"son,
don't
you
shoot
me.
give
me
that
gun,"
and
he
never
would
do
it.
i
was
standing
in
the
door
at
that
time.
i
haven't
entered.
so,
ever
when
the
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
the
kid
got
close
enough
--
from
this,
i
think
that
the
inference
may
flow
that
the
first
entry
into
the
residence
was
made
by
hollingsworth
to
secure
the
shotgun
because
the
boy
had
been
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
not
at
that
point,
but
then,
when
the
boy
got
close
enough,
he
--
as
he
said,
went
for
the
gun.
i
got
to
the
gun.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
thereafter,
agent
langford,
who
was
in
charge
of
this
group
and
agent
evans,
entered
the
house.
now,
in
the
house,
they
found
petitioner's
father
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
and
petitioner's
brother.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
sir.
all
the
rest
were
federal
officers.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
four
of
them.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
a
little
further
on,
on
that
page,
sir,
on
page
r31.
question
"did
you
push
or
shove
mrs.
jones
or
do
anything
like
that?"
answer
"i
did
not
touch
mrs.
jones
as
i
went
in
the
house."
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
i
don't
know.
i'm
willing
to
--
i'm
willing
to
say
that
the
record
shows
that
she
protested
their
entry.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
i'm
--
i'm
going
permission
or
did
they
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
no.
she
--
she
did
not
consent
to
the
entry
and
even
if
she
had,
i
suppose
we
would
have
--
that
could
then
be
very
reasonably
said,
that
well,
this
was
called
acquiescence.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
it
was
an
entry
of
a
protest.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
your
honor,
the
reason
--
i
don't
want
to
use
that
language
"breaking-in"
is
because
"breaking-in"
for
the
purpose
of
arrest,
that
is
in
testing
whether
there
was
a
“breaking-in”
in
the
law
of
arrest
is
“breaking”
has
the
same
meaning
and
“breaking”
has
in
the
law
of
burglary.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
or
a
door
opened
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
here
--
here,
sir,
first,
i
must
say
that
on
--
on
the
motion
to
suppress
which
was
filed
by
petitioner,
he
contended
that
the
search
was
unreasonable
and
that
he
had
not
consented
to
it
and
he
spelled
out
no
specific
reason
why
he
believes
to
be
unreasonable.
now,
at
the
trial,
an
issue
was
never
made,
as
it
was
in
the
miller,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
agents
had
given
notice
of
their
purpose
before
entry.
and
so,
in
the
course
of
a
narrative
statement,
agent
langford
testified
that
he
told
mrs.
millers
his
name.
he
told
her
that
he
was
a
federal
officer.
she
asked
for
a
search
warrant.
he
said
that
he
didn't
need
any
and
that
he
intended
to
enter.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
the
--
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
ever
told
her
that
and
he
was
never
asked.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
the
record
simply
doesn't
say,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that,
your
honor.
on
the
hand,
it
was
never
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
all
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
inconsistency
here,
your
honor.
there,
in
the
miller
case,
there
was
an
issue
as
to
whether
they
had
announced
the
purpose
for
their
entry.
here,
it
never
was
an
issue.
no
one
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
regardless
of
the
relevance
of
the
law,
and
so
the
officers
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
i
--
it
would
not
be
any
--
the
less
provided
that
the
record
established
that.
but
here,
i
will
--
i
cannot
accept
the
proposition
that
there
was
a
breaking-in.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
if
i
will
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
sir?
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
so
long
as
--
well,
so
long
as
there
was
no
manhandling,
no
touching,
no
forcing
her
out
of
the
way,
certainly.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
she
told
him
she
didn't
--
she
told
them
that
she
wanted
them
to
wait
until
--
until
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
was
--
was
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
what
sir?
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
it's
simply
they
entered
over
her
protest.
they
did
not
break-in.
having
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
once
it
would
depend
upon
the
lawfulness
of
their
entry.
otherwise,
as
we
argued
in
miller
and
as
i
say
here,
they're
entitled
to
break-in
or
enter
on
over
protest
only
if
they
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
they
can
make
a
valid
arrest
inside
the
house,
only
if
they
have
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
and
only
if
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
that
they
seek
is
within
the
house.
and
so,
once
again,
it
is
not
the
determinative
factor
in
testing
whether
the
entry
is
illegal.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
here,
i
must
say
that
the
district
court's
finding
was
rather
ambiguous.
however,
we
believe
fairly
implicit
within
his
finding
is
the
drawing
of
the
inference
that
the
agents
entered
to
make
an
arrest
on
probable
cause.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
the
taylor
case
is
on
the
books.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
johnson
is
on
the
books.
there
are
other
cases
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
of
similar
import
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
we
do
not
defend
this
on
the
proposition
that
a
probable
cause
to
make
a
search
for
contraband
alone
justifies
an
entry.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
it
has
to
be
incident
to
an
arrest
or
it
has
to
be
an
entry
made
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
arrest.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
on
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
appellant
is
within
the
house.
now
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
sir?
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
the
latter,
your
honor.
however
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
in
the
ultimate
resolution
of
this
case,
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
think
that
the
facts
carry
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
this
case
so
far
as
to
say
there
was
a
breaking.
that's
all.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that
is
precisely
so,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that
was
--
that
was
the
case
in
miller,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
i
say
that
it
is
irrelevant
that
they
entered
over
protest.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no,
it
is
because
an
issue
was
never
made,
as
it
was
in
the
miller
case,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
given
notice
to
the
wife
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
your
honor.
that
once
again
we
differ
as
to
whether
there
was
a
breaking
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
on
the
fact.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,

grimm
yes,
your

if
i
may
--
if
i
may
continue,
after
entry,
the
agents
found
petitioner's
father
and
petitioner's
brother
inside
the
house.
they
did
not
find
petitioner.
they
also
found
a
distillery
in
a
room
on
the
main
floor
of
the
house.
leading
up
in
this
room
was
a
stairway
to
the
attic.
in
the
attic,
they
found
barrels.
they
found
2700
gallons
of
mash,
a
mash
found
in
all
of
the
other
paraphernalia,
usually
associated
with
the
operation
of
a
distillery.
they
came
back
downstairs,
inquired
with
mrs.
jones
and
the
boy
and
then
went
up
on
the
front
porch
and
waited
for
petitioner.
he
returned
home
at
about
10:00
p.m.
and
admitted
ownership
of
the
still
and
denied
that
the
liquor
found
on
the
truck
came
from
his
operation.
thereafter,
the
agents
made
the
seizure
of
the
still
and
destroyed
that
portion
which
they
could
not
remove
with
them.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
was
a
--
well,
it
was
a
search
for
jones.
i
say
though
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
it
is
roy
jones
who
tell
this
--
in
his
testimony,
what
it
is
that
the
agents
did,
in
connection
with
this
distillery.
on
page
14,
he
says
the
question,
“now,
then,
did
they
seize
that
or
destroyed
or
take
it
with
them
or
what?”
they
took
part
of
it
with
them
and
destroyed
the
rest.
destroyed
it
right
there
in
the
house
or
take
it
outside?
they
destroyed
everything
in
the
house
rather
--
rather
than
the
beer
or
the
mash
whichever
one
you
might
want
to
call
it.
they
pumped
a
good
deal
of
heat
out
and
left
the
rest.
this,
i
take
it
to
--
from
this,
i
believe
you
can
draw
the
inference
that
he
was
there
when
they
did
it
and
that
would
have
to
be
after
he
returned.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
they
had
entered
and
they
have
looked
through
the
house
for
petitioner
and
they
had
come
upon
the
contraband
in
plain
view.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that
would
not
necessarily
be
so,
your
honor,
because
we
contend
that
the
contraband
having
been
in
plain
view
after
a
lawful
entry
and
the
agents
having
come
upon
it
in
plain
view
after
a
lawful
entry.
it
was
subject
to
immediate
forfeiture
and
seizure
by
these
agents.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that's
right,
your
honor.
however,
that
is
simply
the
--
the
way
the
facts
happened
as
--
as
i
believe
they
are
to
be
found.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
search
of
a
dwelling
house
is
justified
on
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
will
be
found
within.
however,
we
do
believe
that
agents
may
--
if
they
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
they
seek
is
within
the
dwelling
house
that
they
may
enter
for
the
purpose
of
finding
him
and
arresting
him.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
and
that
having
--
then,
coming
upon
contraband
in
plain
view,
the
contraband
is
subject
to
seizure.
here,
i
might
also
say
that
this
case
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
one
where
an
arrest
is
made
after
entry,
even
though
no
--
as
it
turned
out,
no
entry
--
no
arrest
was
made
thereafter
because
if
the
test
of
whether
or
not
they're
entitled
to
make
an
entry
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
is
within
there
then
the
fact
that
the
arrest
isn't
--
is
not
made
thereafter,
cannot
be
the
determining
issue.
we
could
not
justify
an
entry
by
what
is
found
thereafter
on
the
person
if
someone
who
was
arrested.
we
could
not
justify
his
arrest
by
the
fact
that
he
might
be
found
committing
a
felony.
the
test
is
still
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
committing
a
felony
at
the
time
of
entry.
and
so,
the
fact
that
an
arrest
could
not
be
made
ultimately,
does
not
measure
the
lawfulness
of
the
entry.
nonetheless,
we
come
back
to
the
proposition
that
if
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
they
sought
was
within
the
house
and
if
they
had
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest,
then
the
entry
is
lawful.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
they
could
have
made
the
seizure
at
the
time
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
they
were
first
within
the
house.
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
the
taking
of
the
barrel,
the
boiler,
and
the
burner.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
no,
your
honor.
it
is
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
by
--
by
finding
and
then
taking
charge
of
it.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
i
would
say
there
that
the
seizure
occurs
when
they
first
exercised
dominion
over
the
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
when
they
first
came
upon
it
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
because
certainly
thereafter,
they
would
not
permit
anyone
to
remove
it.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
in
--
in
legal
theory
that
might
well
be
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
in
practical
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
in
--
in
practical
--
well,
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
practical
effect,
when
they
put
their
hands
on
it,
when
they
made
a
physical
seizure
was
after
jones
returned.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
i
would
say
that
that
is
in
legal
theory
when
the
seizure
took
place.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
when
they
came
upon
the
contraband
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
i
would
say.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
in
the
home.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
sir?
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
as
of
the
morning
--
2:00
a.m.
in
the
morning
of
may
2nd
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
--
they
had
probable
cause,
at
least
then.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
that
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that
evening,
that
evening.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
a
day
--
a
day.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
i
think
so.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
but
may
i
--
may
i
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
they
had
--
as
i
say,
that
was
after
2:00
a.m.
on
the
morning
of
may
2nd.
that
afternoon,
they
did
go
and
obtained
a
daytime
search
warrant.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
now,
may
--
may
i
answer
your
--
take
time
to
answer
your
question,
sir.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
first
of
all,
when
i
used
the
word
“came
upon,”
they
--
they
entered
the
house
as
we
contend
to
arrest
petitioner.
now,
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
commotion
outside
and
they
could
reasonably
infer
that
he
might
be
hiding
inside
the
house.
and
so,
they
could
look
into
each
room
in
the
house.
now,
they
didn't
know
where
in
the
house
was
the
distillery
was
and
when
i
say,
“they
came
upon
it,”
i
mean,
“they
came
upon,”
it's
exactly
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
now,
insofar
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned,
it
is
true
as
--
as
you
--
certainly
true
as
you've
just
said
that
it
begins
a
person
--
people
shall
be
secured
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
that
no
warrant
shall
issue.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
amendment
has
been
read
by
this
court,
to
mean
that
the
latter
portion
of
the
amendment
limits
the
first
portion.
and
so,
through
judicial
decision,
we
have
evolved
the
concepts
of
certain
kinds
of
searches
that
are
reasonable,
thus,
the
search
on
proper
warrant.
search
warrant
is
reasonable,
thus,
the
search
incident
to
arrest
is
reasonable.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
sir?
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
arrest
on
probable
cause.
yes,
your
honor,
in
agnello.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
in
agnello
versus
u.s.,
269
u.s.10
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes,
sir.
but
that
was
an
arrest
on
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
that
was
an
arrest
on
probable
cause,
your
honor.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
without
warrant.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
it
was
committed
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
well,
the
construction
is,
it's
committed
in
their
presence
because
they
saw
it,
but
a
felony
is
also
generally
construed
to
be
in
your
presence
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
(voice
overlap)
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
sir?
kindly
--
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
[laugh]
i
don't
believe
i
said
that,
your
honor.
whether
or
not
they
did.
mr.
engene
l.
grimm
yes
--
yes,
sir,
surely.
and
it
is
one
of
the
later
pronouncements
of
this
court.
thank
you
your
honors.
