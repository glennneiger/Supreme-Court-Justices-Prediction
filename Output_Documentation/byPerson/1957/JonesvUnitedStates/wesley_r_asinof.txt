mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
involved
in
this
case
is
on
the
question
of
the
validity
of
a
search
of
a
private
dwelling
house
and
the
seizure
of
contraband
articles
without
a
search
warrant,
the
search
having
been
made
during
the
night
season
and
based
upon
probable
cause
in
a
case
wherein
the
federal
agents
had
ample
opportunity
to
procure
a
valid
search
warrant.
the
case
arose
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
and
from
the
facts
found
by
the
trial
judge
after
hearing
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
the
case
of
certain
articles
that
were
found
inside
the
house.
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
procure
a
search
warrant,
there
being
five
officers
in
approximately
two
doors.
the
evidence
disclosed
before
the
trial
judge
that
the
agents
of
the
government
had
had
the
dwelling
house
under
observation
for
approximately
three
days,
that
they
had
probable
cause
for
believing
that
a
--
an
illicit
distillery
was
in
operation
inside
the
house.
without
going
into
the
question
of
the
facts
that
gave
them
--
that
gave
rise
to
the
probable
cause,
we
will
concede
and
it
concede
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
probable
cause.
on
the
afternoon
of
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
for
the
procuring
of
a
warrant.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
yes,
sir.
during
the
afternoon
that
the
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
over
a
period
of
three
days.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
have
to
answer
it
in
this
way,
if
your
honor
please.
on
the
afternoon
of
the
--
on
the
afternoon
when
the
actual
search
was
made
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
the
search
was
made
at
9:15
but
during
the
afternoon
about
1
o'
clock
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
about
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
the
agents
went
to
gainesville,
some
distance
of
just
a
few
miles,
and
procured
a
daytime
search
warrant,
a
daylight
search
warrant
based
on
the
information
or
the
probable
cause
that
they
had.
the
commission
had
issued
a
warrant
to
the
agents
to
execute
a
search
warrant
during
the
daylight
hours.
they
then
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor,
rule
41
(c)
provides
that
if
the
--
if
the
affidavits
are
positive
that
--
that
the
contraband
is
in
the
house,
then
the
commission
may
--
may
authorize
the
search
to
be
made
at
any
time
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
but
if
they
are
based
upon
information
and
belief,
then
he
may
only
direct
the
search
to
be
made
in
the
daytime.
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
--
that
i
will
develop
in
my
argument.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
that
is
the
search
warrant
that
they
had
but
the
government
does
not
and
never
has
contended
it
was
used.
now,
what
they
did?
they
waited
until
9:15
that
night
until
after
it
became
dark.
the
trial
judge
found
that
the
reason
that
they
had
waited
was
because
the
agents
wanted
to
see
if
they
could
see
some
other
vehicles
that
they
might
have
seen
going
in
or
coming
out
of
that
property.
so,
at
9:15
at
night,
they
made
their
initial
move
to
search
the
premises.
at
the
time
the
petitioner,
roy
jones,
was
not
at
home
but
his
wife
and
little
boy
had
come
in
the
front
door
and
had
blocked
the
entrance
to
the
door
and
asked
him
not
to
come
in,
to
wait
until
the
husband
came
home,
not
with
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
to
search.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
--
the
reason
that
the
--
that
the
agents
gave
according
to
the
record
is
that
they
didn't
need
--
she
asked
them
for
a
warrant.
she
said,
“where
is
your
warrant?”
they
said,
“we
don't
need
a
warrant,
we're
coming
in.”
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
they
--
they
did
not,
at
that
time,
state
what
they
were
going
in
there
for.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
they
just
said
--
according
to
the
record
they
said,
“we
are
federal
law.
we
are
coming
in,
we
do
not
need
a
warrant.”
that
is
what
the
records
show.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
don't
believe
that
the
trial
judge
found.
he
did
find
that
--
that
--
i
believe
that
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
trial
judge
are
quite
extensive,
quite
lengthy.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
he
--
he
made
the
finding
of
fact
in
there
that
the
reason
that
they
did
not
execute
the
warrant
in
the
daytime
was
because
they
wanted
to
see
if
they
could
find
some
vehicles
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
they
told
her,
“we
are
going
in.”
they
did
not
state
that
--
they
just
simply,
according
to
the
record,
said
to
her,
“we
are
federal
law.
we
do
not
need
a
warrant.
we're
coming
in.”
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
specific
language
used
by
them
to
say,
“we're
going
in
for
either
to
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
recall
any
specific
language
that
was
used
along.
but
that
is
to
say
as
to
the
purpose
they
went.
however,
they
agent
who
was
in
charged
did
testify
and
he
was
asked
two
or
three
times,
and
i
pointed
it
out
in
my
reply
brief,
that
he
was
asked
several
times
why
they
--
why
they
went
in
there,
and
his
reply
to
it
was,
to
the
effect
that
they
had
gone
in
for
that
purpose.
he
just
--
he
never
did
say
that
they
had
gone
in
to
arrest
anyone
or
place
anyone
under
arrest.
that
was
the
government
contends
in
this
case
that
the
--
that
the
purpose
of
going
in
the
house
was
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
felony
was
being
committed
inside
the
house
and
having
that
probable
cause
that
they
had
the
right
to
go
in
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
and
that
after
they
got
in
the
house
that
they
discovered
that
there
was
an
illicit
distillery
in
the
house,
and
being
in
there
lawfully,
they
had
the
right
to
see
the
illicit
distillery.
that
was
the
point
that's
made
by
the
government.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir,
she
specifically
says,
“my
husband
is
not
at
home.
wait
until
roy
comes
back.”
and
they
--
they
went
in.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
finding
is
to
the
effect
that
the
husband
was
not
in
the
house
and
came
there
by
an
hour
later.
he
was
placed
under
arrest
after
the
distillery
had
been
seized.
now,
getting
to
the
point
that
they
had
secured
a
daylight
search
warrant,
they
went
in
the
premises
at
9:15
at
night
and
the
trial
judge
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
reason
that
they
had
waited
was
an
order
that
they
could
find
vehicles
either
going
in
or
coming
out.
but
they
--
the
probable
cause
that
we
contend
that
they
had
and
the
record
shows
that
they
had,
exist
at
the
time
they
went
to
gainesville
to
procure
the
daylight
search
warrant
and
based
on
that,
the
magistrate
authorized
him
to
make
a
daylight
search.
he
did
not
make
a
daylight
search
and
the
trial
judge
found,
and
it
was
conceded
by
the
government
in
the
trial
court
in
the
record,
that
the
search
was
not
made
pursuant
to
the
daylight
search
warrant
but
was
made
based
on
probable
cause.
now,
the
actual
finding
made
by
the
trial
judge,
that
is
to
say
the
conclusions
of
law
that
the
court
reached
in
--
in
overruling
the
motion
to
suppress
was
based
solely
upon
the
rabinowitz
case.
it
was
decided
by
this
court
some
few
years
ago
on
the
theory
as
the
trial
judge
held
and
upheld
in
a
per
curiam
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
that
they
do
not
need
a
search
warrant.
we
contend
that
probable
cause,
as
used
in
the
constitution
in
the
fourth
amendment,
relates
to
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
procure
a
search
warrant
and
not
what
must
exist
in
order
for
the
officer
to
make
a
search.
the
language
used
in
the
fourth
amendment
would
require
such
a
construction
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
is
correct.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
construction
or
the
interpretation
that
i
believe
that
you
would
have
to
put
on
the
trial
judge's
opinion
in
this
case.
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
the
--
the
government
takes
a
new
view
after
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
--
the
government
now
takes
this
view.
the
government
now
in
this
court,
for
the
first
time,
takes
the
view
that
--
that
in
this
case
that
the
officers
or
the
agents
had
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
go
into
a
house
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
and
that
after
they
got
in
there,
they
incidentally
found
that
there
was
an
illicit
distillery
in
the
house.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
the
language
that's
used
in
the
brief,
i
--
it
--
it's
not
fully
clear
to
me
as
to
exactly
which
view
they
are
taking.
they
say
that
they
do
not
read
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
as
justifying
the
conclusion
that
the
raid
was
made
or
the
seizure
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
going
in
there
without
going
in
to
make
an
arrest.
but
the
way
i
read
it,
of
course,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
clear,
one
way
or
the
other
that
they
did
go
in
and
that
they
had
a
probable
cause
and
they
had
submission
time
to
procure
one.
i
raised
this
pointed,
if
--
if
the
court
please,
that
when
the
officers
or
the
agents
went
to
gainesville
to
procure
the
daylight
search
warrant,
that
they
had
the
probable
cause
at
that
time,
whether
they
were
going
in
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
seizing
the
distillery
or
arresting
the
petitioner
because
of
the
probable
cause
that
they
had
to
arrest
him,
they
could
have,
at
that
time,
have
procured
a
warrant
to
arrest
him
if
that
probable
cause
exists
at
that
time
and
the
government
contends
that
it
did.
but
they
did
not,
at
any
time,
attempt
to
procure
a
warrant
to
arrest
or
to
search
with
the
exception
of
the
daylight
search
warrant
that
they
did
actually
procure.
now,
the
trial
judge
in
his
--
in
his
findings
of
fact
--
now,
we
--
there's
no
question
but
what
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
officers.
and
the
trial
judge
said
that
although
the
officers
had
ample
opportunity
to
execute
the
daylight
search
warrant
during
the
daylight
hours,
they
did
not
do
so
but
desiring
to
see
as
any
vehicles
engaged
in
removing
the
illicit
liquors,
they
did
not
immediately
execute
the
daylight
search
warrant
but
remained
on
watching
until
after
dark
until
about
9
o'clock
p.m.
and
this,
i
believe,
would
answer
your
honor's
question
that
at
that
time,
the
officers
attempt
to
gain
entrance
in
the
dwelling
of
roy
jones
who
was
not
at
home
at
that
time.
mrs.jones
attempted
to
block
the
doorway
requesting
the
officers
to
wait
until
the
husband
arrives.
and
at
that
time,
a
12-year
old
son
of
the
appellant
obtained
a
shotgun
and
held
it
in
a
threatening
manner
in
an
attempt
to
keep
the
officers
from
searching
the
premises.
mrs.
jones
asked
the
officer
if
he
had
a
search
warrant,
and
he
stated
that
he
did
not
need
one.
in
other
words,
she
specifically
did
ask,
according
to
the
record,
for
a
search
warrant.
so
we
contend
that
if
the
officers
had
gone
in
there
for
any
purpose
other
than
the
search
of
the
premises,
they
would
have,
at
that
time,
stated
so.
but
they
went
in
regardless
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
there
was
no
warrant
whatsoever.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor,
they
contend
this.
the
rabinowitz
case
is
a
case
wherein
the
--
the
deputy
marshals
having
a
valid
warrant
of
arrest
went
in
to
arrest
the
petitioner
and
at
that
time,
incidental
to
the
service
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
they
contend
--
they
--
they're
asking
for
an
extension
of
that
case
into
--into
this
sort
of
a
situation
that
where
officers
have
probable
cause
to
--
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
they
contend
that
they
have
the
right
to
go
in
to
private
property
in
order
to
make
that
arrest
and
then
after
they're
in
there,
incidentally,
if
they
find
illicit
property
that
they
therefore
have
the
right
to
seize.
we
contend
that's
not
the
law.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
don't
understand
that
either,
your
honor.
that
--
that
is
the
very
point
that
--
that's
the
very
point
that
i'm
--
i'm
merely
trying
to
argue
against
the
government's
contention.
i
do
not
understand
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
say
if
--
if
your
honor
please
that
--
that
where
a
sufficient
time
exists
to
procure
a
search
warrant
and
the
officers
do
not
procure
one
and
there
is
no
emergency
or
unusual
circumstances
or
it
is
not
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest
upon
a
valid
warrant
of
arrest,
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
make
the
search
without
a
valid
search
warrant.
but
in
such
cases,
they
must
procure
a
valid
search
warrant
where
it
is
practicable
to
procure
one.
in
other
words,
the
rabinowitz
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
is
--
that
is
my
interpretation
that
this
court
placed
upon
a
case
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
was
an
unreasonable
search.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
was
in
view
of
the
--
in
view
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
do
not
understand
that
the
--
that
the
law
authorizes
the
government
to
make
a
search
of
a
private
dwelling
house
except
in
two
instances.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
no,
your
honor,
the
taylor
case
is
not
against
that.
in
the
taylor
case,
as
i
--
as
i
recall,
the
government
relies
upon
the
taylor
case
but
we
do
also
--
the
taylor
case
did
not
hold
that
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
rabinowitz
case
is
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
that
--
that,
of
course,
is
--
that,
of
course,
is
what
made
it
reasonable
in
the
rabinowitz
case.
it
made
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
don't
know
what
case,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
the
rabinowitz
case
does
not
hold
that,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
holds
--
it
holds
incidental
to
a
--
to
a
valid
warrant
of
arrest
that
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
if
--
well,
that
--
in
that
case,
though
it
was
a
--
it
was
an
arrest
was
made
upon
a
valid
warrant
of
arrest.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
now
according
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
provided
the
search
is
reasonable.
now
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
reasonableness
is
the
main
--
is
the
main
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
but,
of
course,
reasonable
--
that
would
be
one
of
the
elements
of
reasonableness,
that
is
to
say
whether
or
not
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
that
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
but
then,
the
jeffers
case,
if
--
if
your
honor
please,
that
jeffers
case
change
that.
now,
in
the
jeffers
case,
this
court
went
on
and
said
over
and
again,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
the
mandate
of
the
amendment
requires
adherence
to
judicial
processes.
only
where
incidental
to
a
valid
arrest
or
in
exceptional
circumstances
may
an
exemption
lie
and
then
the
burden
is
on
those
seeking
the
exemption
to
show
the
need
for.
now,
that,
of
course,
is
--
was
the
one
of
the
latest
expressions
by
this
court
and
was
an
expression
related
in
the
rabinowitz
case.
now,
the
trial
judge
found
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
procure
--
to
--
to
make
the
search
that
they
do
not
need
a
search
warrant,
now,
if
that
is
the
law,
then
all
need
for
search
warrants
is
at
an
end
because,
as
i
understand,
the
decisions
thus
far
that
in
order
to
procure
a
valid
search
warrant,
the
officers
must
first
have
a
probable
cause.
and
probable
cause
is
something
that
must
be
determined
by
a
--
an
impartial
magistrate
and
not
by
the
officers
themselves.
in
order
to
procure
a
valid
warrant
to
search,
the
magistrate
must
pass
upon
whether
or
not
those
circumstances
are
sufficient
to
show
it.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
oh,
no.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
--
i
do
not.
i
do
not
except
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
except
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
don't
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
well,
they
did
not
act
on
what
this
court
has
decided,
if
your
honor
please,
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
just
wrote
a
per
curiam
decision
in
this
case
affirming
the
trial
judge.
and
the
trial
judge
based
it
upon
the
rabinowitz
case
which
is
not
in
point.
it
is
not
in
point
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
if
--
no,
your
honor.
there
--
there
was
no
arrest
made
in
the
house
and
that
is
the
point
in
this
case.
the
government
contends
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
they
did
not.
that
was
a
12-year
old
boy.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
he
was
inside
the
house.
but
there
was
no
arrest
made
in
the
house.
the
government
contends
that
the
officers
now,
the
government
contends
that
the
--
that
the
agents
went
in
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
arrest,
although
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
is
the
government's
contention
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record,
no
statement
by
any
agent
that
he
went
in
there
for
that
purpose.
there's
no
--
there's
no
statement
they
have
been
watching
the
house
for
about
three
days.
during
that
time,
there's
no
evidence
that
they
saw
the
petitioner
going
in
or
coming
out.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
thought
or
believed
he
was
in
there.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
had
--
that
they
had
anytime
attempted
to
procure
a
warrant
to
arrest
him
or
not.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that
is
correct
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
--
that
is
not
position
taken
by
the
government
in
--
in
the
trial
court
and
it
was
not
the
position
taken
by
the
government
in
the
appellate
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
position
was
first
taken
in
this
court.
now,
we
have,
in
this
case
--
we
--
we
contend
this,
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
daylight
search
warrant
and
a
nighttime
search
warrant,
a
distinction
made
by
rule
41
(c).
and
i
noticed
that
the
government
in
their
responds,
in
their
response
brief,
has
not,
at
any
time,
sought
to
answer
that
argument.
and
the
argument
is
this,
that
it
requires
positive
affidavits
in
order
to
procure
a
nighttime
search
warrant
and
merely
probable
affidavit
stating
probable
cause
to
procure
a
daylight
search
warrant.
the
officers
in
this
case
did
not
at
the
time
they
went
in
to
make
the
search
whether
with
or
without
the
warrant
at
9:15
at
night.
they
did
not
have
positive
information
that
a
distillery
was
in
operation
in
the
house,
and
they
went
in.
and
we
contend
that
even
under
rule
41
(c),
that
even
a
magistrate,
even
the
entire
judicial
power
of
the
--
of
the
united
states
could
not,
under
those
facts,
have
authorized
a
search
during
the
night
season.
and
that
when
the
officers
did
in
this
case
when
they
--
when
they
went
in
and
--
and
made
the
seizure,
during
the
night
season,
that
they
went
further
that
then
--
then
the
entire
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
could
have
actually
authorized
under
rule
41
(c).
now,
this
is
a
point
that
i
have
raised
in
my
brief
and
the
government
has
not
answered.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
--
i
have
better
ones
than
that
and
--
if
your
honor
please.
but
we
--
we
contend
that
in
this
case
that
the
government
--
the
government's
main
point
that
they
raise
is,
that
they
went
in
to
make
an
arrest,
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
going
in.
we
say
that
there
is
absolutely
not
want
to
order
of
testimony
in
the
record.
there's
no
evidence
and
there's
no
fact
finding
or
--
or
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
judge
to
sustain
the
contention
made
by
the
government
to
this
effect.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
think
it
made
no
difference,
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
constitution
still
stands
between
the
--
the
government
and
the
citizen
to
protect
them
for
many
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
this
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
according
to
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
was
a
steel.
a
steel
--
a
contraband
steel
was
seized.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
it
was
--
it
was
what
was
known
as
a
large-type
steel.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
they
--
they
destroyed
it
according
to
the
evidence.
they
destroyed
the
steel
inside
the
house.
and
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
about
five
minutes
of
my
time
(inaudible)
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
i
would
like
to
take
the
remaining
time
that
i
have
to
answer
a
question
from
mr.
justice
brennan,
with
reference
to
the
force
angle
that
was
used
in
--
and
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
on
page
19
of
that
brief.
there's
an
appendix
in
there
of
the
testimony
of
mrs.roy
jones
as
to
this
particular
portion,
right
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page,
this
is
her
answer.
speaking
about
the
agent,
the
federal
agent,
he
says,
“we
don't
wait.”
so,
he
kept
pushing
and
i
kept
pushing
back
and
they'd
sling
me
first
one
way
and
the
other.
but
then,
i
come
back
on
them
and
there's
one
of
them,
that
little
old,
i
don't
know
which
one
he
was,
a
little
short
one,
he
told
my
little
boy,
he
said,
“you
stand
back
or
i
slap
your
brains
out,”
and
i
say,
“you
won't
put
your
hands
on
my
kid.”
and
i
asked
the
question,
“how
old
is
that
little
boy?”
and
said
--
she
said,
“well,
he
was
12
at
that
time.”
i
say,
“you
won't
put
your
hands
on
my
kid.”
he
says,
“i'll
slap
his
damn
brains
out,”
and
there
was
another
one
there.
he
said
to
that
other
one,
he
says,
“here,
put
this
handcuffs
on
him.”
he
slapped
my
hands
behind
me
and
got
one
of
the
handcuffs
on
me.
woody
come
up
and
say,
“you
take
the
handcuffs
off
of
her,”
so
he
took
the
handcuffs
off
of
me.
and
then
right
on
the
bottom
of
page
20,
in
response
to
a
question
on
cross-examination
by
the
district
attorney.
question
“and
they
didn't
do
anything
to
you
except
to
go
pass
you
and
get
into
the
house?”
answer
“no.
they
--
i
was
at
the
door
and
they
pushed
me
against
the
side
of
the
door
and
i
run
in
front
of
them
again.
they
would
push
me
back
up
against
the
wall
and
i'd
come
back
and
i'd
pushed
them
again.
and
when
they
put
their
feet
and
skinned
--
well,
they
had
skinned
my
feet
all
over
kicking.
i
reckon
not
stopping,
as
i
was
pushing
them
backwards.”
now,
the
record
just
shows
that
this
was
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
your
honor.
it's
in
the
appendix
on
page
19
and
20.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
no,
your
honor.
we
--
we
omitted
it
from
printing,
but
we
put
in
the
other
--
in
as
much
as
the
solicitor
general
put
this
of
it.
now,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
also
to
another
question
as
for
mr.
justice
brennan
yesterday.
on
page
51
of
the
record,
this
testimony
appears
in
here
a
question.
“what
was
the
reason,
please
sir,
that
you
told
mrs.jones
that
you
did
not
need
a
search
warrant
or
didn't
have
one?”
answer
“because
i
thought
we
had
sufficient
evidence
to
go
in
the
premises
without
a
search
warrant.”
question
“you
didn't
exhibit
this
search
warrant
that
you
had
to
her?”
answer
“i
did
not.
that
was
a
daytime
search
warrant.”
and
on
page
54
of
the
record,
the
trial
judge
found
this
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
to
the
entry.
mrs.
jones
asked
officer
woody
langford
if
he
had
a
search
warrant
and
langford
replied
that
he
did
not
need
one
and
the
officers
then
searched
the
premises
without
a
search
warrant,
with
reference
to
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
on
the
same
page,
the
trial
judge
found
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
reference
to
the
--
he
says
the
house
had
only
two
or
three
doors
and
they
were
five
officers
watching
the
residence
and
would
have
been
possible
for
the
officers
to
watch
each
of
the
doors
and
still
send
another
officer
for
a
nighttime
search
warrant
had
the
officers
deemed
this
to
be
necessary.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
in
the
trial
judge's
findings
of
fact,
he
says,
"the
court
finds
that
probable
cause
for
the
search
existed
at
the
time
the
search
was
made.
there
was
no
finding
that
there
was
any
question
of
going
in
there
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
arrest,"
as
contended
by
the
government
in
this
court.
now,
this,
if
the
court
please,
we
say
that
this
case
is
on
all
fours
with
the
kaplan
case.
it
was
decided
by
judge
learned
hand
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
i
believe.
on
page
--
page
5
of
our
reply
brief.
in
that
case,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
with
reference
to
a
warrant
of
arrest
and
this
case
was
--
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
the
court
said
this,
“the
statute
certainly
requires
a
warrant
when
there
is
time
to
obtain
one
that
this
concession
is
limited
to
occasions
when
it
is
not
safe
to
wait,”
and
they
were
speaking
of
arrest
warrants
in
that
case.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
there
was
no
question,
but
what
they
did
have
was
an
ample
amount
of
time
to
have
obtained
some
warrant
of
some
kind,
either
to
search
or
to
arrest.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
there
was
a
warrant
for
arrest
in
rabinowitz
and
it
was
based
upon
that
warrant.
now,
we
respect
--
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
mr.
wesley
r.
asinof
that's
correct.
