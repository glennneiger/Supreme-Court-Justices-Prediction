justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
right
there,
did
--
what
did
the
officers
tell
the
wife?
what's
the
reason
they
wanted
to
go
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
only
reason
they
go
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
what
purpose
did
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they,
at
any
time
before
they
went
by
her
and
into
the
house,
say
why
it
was
they
wanted
to
go
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
fact
finding
whether
with
there
was
any
stated
purpose
and
what's
that
stated
purpose
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
make
any
finding
on
this
specific
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
matter
or
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
--
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
what
did
they
tell
the
wife
before
they
went
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
did
the
trial
judge
make
any
finding
whether
there
was
any
specific
language
used
by
them
as
to
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
wife
told
the
officers
before
they
went
to
inquire
and
into
the
house
that
the
husband
was
not
at
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
finding
whether
or
not
the
husband
was
in
the
house?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
view
of
the
government
here,
as
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
government
takes
the
view
that
there
has
to
have
been
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
and
the
search
incident
to
that
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
they're
not
defending
the
view
of
the
trial
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
did
i
understand
you?
there
was
no
warrant
of
arrest
here,
was
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
the
government's
position
that
they
might
reasonably
believe
that
the
husband
was
in
the
house
in
spite
the
wife's
denial
of
it
and
having
reasonable
or
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he's
guilty
of
the
crime
may
enter
to
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
him
even
though
he
wasn't
there,
that
their
entry
for
that
purpose
justified
their
seizing
the
evidence
which
was
subsequently
used
against
them
to
convict
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
you
telling
us
that
this
is
the
first
time
the
government
has
sought
to
sustain
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
seizure
on
the
basis
of
an
entry
with
probable
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
cause
to
believe
that
the
husband
was
there
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
better
points
on
the
matter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
seized?
a
steel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
steel?
big
one?
small
one?
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
difficult
to
move
or
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
grimm,
tell
me
you
rely
on
the
arrests
of
the
people
on
the
truck
as
having
any
bearing
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
entering
of
the
house?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
--
that
it
says
a
matter
of
evidence,
in
other
words,
that
it
is
evidence
which
shows
light
upon
that
purpose
in
entering
the
house
is
really
a
purpose
to
make
an
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
mr.
grimm,
in
that
respect,
his
testimony.
"i
was
standing
in
the
door
at
that
time,‚Äù
i'm
looking
at
page
38,
"hadn't
entered.
so,
ever
when
the
kid
got
close
enough
so
that
i
could
get
to
the
gun.
i
got
the
gun,
sir,
got
the
gun
from
the
kid."
now,
does
that
show
that
he
entered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
only
testimony
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
it,
upon
which
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
finding
the
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
support
any
finding
that
he
had
--
he
entered
to
get
the
gun,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
it
be
when
he
says,
"i
was
standing
in
the
door
at
that
time,
hadn't
enter.
so,
ever
when
the
kid
got
close
enough
so
that
i
could
get
to
the
gun,
i
got
the
gun,
sir.
i
got
the
gun
from
the
kid."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
where
you're
making
this
inference
that
he
had
entered
when
he
said
he
hadn't
entered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
other
officers,
was
it
evans?
i
guess
he
was
a
federal
officer,
hollingsworth
was
the
state
officer,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
federal
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
that
at
page
31,
evans
says,
"she,"
that's
the
wife,
"was
standing
in
the
front
door."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
came
in,
in
the
door,
she
was
standing
in
the
front
door
with
her
hands
like
this,
spread
from
one
side
to
the
door
way
to
the
other.
and
the
trial
judge,
the
finding
is
that
mrs.
roy
jones
undertook
to
block
the
door
way
to
keep
the
officers
from
entering
the
dwelling
house,
telling
the
officers
to
wait
until
her
husband
roy
jones
returned.
now,
did
the
officers
break-in
or
forced
their
way
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
if
they
didn't,
is
there
--
would
--
did
she
admit
them?
was
it
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
--
then
--
then
she
more
than
--
what
you
call
their
entry
then
was
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
wasn't
it
--
wasn't
it
a
breaking-in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
wasn't
my
question.
wasn't
it
a
breaking-in
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
perhaps
to
be
a
window
forced
or
a
door
forced
opened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
would
not
come
into
the
category
of
break-in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
then,
is
that
the
reason
the
government
hasn't
taken
the
position
it
did
in
the
miller
case
a
few
weeks
ago
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
give
notice
of
the
purpose
of
coming
in
if
you
are
breaking-in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
never
told
her
why
he
wanted
to
go
in.
he
never
told
her
he
was
entering
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
the
petitioner,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
didn't
tell
anybody
the
purpose,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
he
was
entering?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
whether
we
got
what
the
record
to
go
upon,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
at
all
that
shows
that
he
announced
his
purpose
for
desiring
to
enter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
just
interested
how
the
government
distinguishes
this
from
the
miller
case,
the
position
that
took
there
was
that
even
if
it
was
an
entry
on
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest,
it
would
be
unlawful
entry
except
there's
a
purpose
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
this
was
breaking-in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
was
a
breaking-in,
as
to
which
a
prior
statement
of
purpose
for
the
breaking
is
required,
would
it
be
any
less
and
unlawful
entry
because
the
petitioner
didn't
raise
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
because
they
didn't
break
a
door
or
a
window
and
that's
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
view
of
what's
the
breaking
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
view
of
what
a
breaking
is?
there
couldn't
be
if
they
did
force
their
way
pass
mrs.
jones,
that
would
not
be
a
break-in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
it
if
they
entered
over
her
protest.
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
what
kind
of
entry
was
it
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
weren't
admitted
voluntarily,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
they
entered
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you've
got
me
confused,
mr.
grimm.
i
thought
you
told
me
before
that
if
there
was
a
breaking,
if
this
was
a
break-in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
consistent
with
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
the
miller
case.
it
could
not
be
a
lawful
entry,
even
for
the
purposes
of
making
an
arrest
on
probable
cause
unless
that
it
was
first
announced
the
purpose
of
the
entry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
what
are
you
saying
here?
are
you
saying
here
that
even
if
there
was
a
breaking,
no
statement
of
purpose
was
required
or
that
there
was
no
breaking
in
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
because
this
was
not
a
breaking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
if
i
understand
it,
that
means
that
even
if
this
was
a
break-in
in
these
circumstances,
since
they
never
heretofore
raised
the
question
of
the
requirement
of
prior
notice
of
purpose
or
entry,
that
is
she
was
not
before,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
--
let
me
see
if
i
get
this
now.
is
this
the
position
that
there
was
no
seizure
at
all
until
after
jones
got
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
was
that
they
have
done
before
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they've
done
nothing
with
anything
until
he
arrived
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
are
you
cogitating
the
legality
of
the
seizure
then
upon
the
fact
that
all
were
secured
after
he
came
home
and
was
placed
under
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
position
you
take
in
your
brief,
isn't
it?
you
don't
relate
this
until
jones'
returned
home.
you
relate
it
to
the
fact
that
you
had
a
reasonable
cause
for
entering,
thinking
he
was
their
when
you
entered,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
arrest
on
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
arrest
on
warrant.
did
this
court
ever
gone
beyond
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assert
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
that
the
one
where
they
saw
him
through
the
window?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
very
different
from
this
one,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
they
saw
the
actual
crime
through
the
window
being
committed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suggest
you
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
very
different
case
than
the
one
we
have
here.
