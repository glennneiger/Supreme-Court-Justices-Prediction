had
you
completed
your
opening
argument,
mr.
asinof?
chief
justice
earl

you
may
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time
if
you
wish.
mr.

chief

she
was
--
suppose
she
was
out
on
the
porch
and
--
and
protested
the
entry
and
they
just
paid
no
attention
to
it,
went
over
and
opened
the
door
and
walked
in,
would
that
--
would
that
be
a
break-in,
an
entry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
constituted
the
seizure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
the
taking
possession
of
the
household
and
what's
in
there,
and
dispossessing
those
who
are
living
there
at
the
time,
although
they
were
not
--
practically
not
confused
of
violating
the
law
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
do
a
--
can
you
break
into
a
house
and
go
all
through
the
--
the
house
and
search
it
and
find
something
that
is
--
is
contraband
and
stay
there
as
officers
of
the
law,
in
charge
of
it
without
having
made
a
seizure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
there
is
no
seizure
until
--
until
they
removed
it
from
the
premises?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
when
did
they
first
exercise
dominion
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
now
wasn't
that
--
would
then
the
seizure
take
place
then
rather
than
when
jones
came
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
aren't
we
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
we
talking
about
legal
seizure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
you
relying
on
now,
the
time
as
before
the
seizure?
i
understood
you
a
little
while
ago
to
say
that
you
dated
the
seizure
from
the
time
that
jones
came
home,
but
i
understood
your
question
to
me
that
in
point
of
law
the
seizure
actually
took
place
when
they
took
dominion
over
the
home.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
when
did
the
seizure
take
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
home?
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
were
--
you
were
in
the
commissioner's
office
that
day
on
this
same
subject
and
you
did
do
the
affidavits
where
--
that
you
have
probable
cause
at
that
time,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
that
was
based
on
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
a
still
in
that
house.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
based
on
the
affidavit
of
the
officers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
asinof,
you
may
close
your
argument.
