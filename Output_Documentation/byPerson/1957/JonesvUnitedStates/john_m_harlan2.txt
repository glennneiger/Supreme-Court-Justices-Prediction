justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
--
you
think
that
the
court
read
the
rabinowitz
case
as
saying
independently
of
an
arrest
that
if
you
have
probable
cause,
you
can
search
without
a
warrant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
way
they
read
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
taylor
case
flatly
against
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
time
is
that?
what
time
of
the
day
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there's
no
dispute
that
after
he
disarmed
him,
they
prolonged
their
visit
in
the
house.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding
pf
the
purpose
of
the
entry
was
to
make
an
arrest?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
i
read
the
district
court's
opinion,
it
seemed
to
me
that
their
construction
of
it
was
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
he
said
that
we
didn't
have
to
have
a
search
warrant,
that
it
suffice
to
have
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
there
was
contraband
or
something
on
the
premises.
and
that
without
a
search
warrant,
that
was
enough
to
justify
the
entry.
and
you
don't
undertake
to
defend
the
case
on
that
basis.
now,
that's
the
way
i
read
the
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
--
yes,
it
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
--
to
be
frank
about
it,
isn't
the
plain
truth
in
the
matter
that
you
don't
undertake
to
justify
the
search
on
the
premise
--
on
the
premises
on
which
the
district
court
put
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
to
be
an
incident
to
an
arrest,
that's
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
claim
is
that
the
seizure
was
made
after
the
arrest?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
opted
it,
what
occurred
before
jones
showed
up
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
simply
a
reconnaissance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
jones
had
never
come
back
to
the
house
at
all,
your
position
would
be
that
they
could
have
seized
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(voice
overlap)
in
the
house.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
recall
that,
in
your
appendix
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
it
printed
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
warrant
of
arrest
in
rabinowitz,
if
you
got
them?
