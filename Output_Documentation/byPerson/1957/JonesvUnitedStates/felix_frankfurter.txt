probable
cause
for
--
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
--
to
have
gotten
a
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
i
think
the
detail
and
fact
are
essential,
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
time
of
the
case.
is
the
--
the
probable
cause
derived
on
your
concession
and
your
present
statement
on
the
basis
of
what
they'd
observed
over
what
period
of
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
did
--
when
did
the
situation
develop
that
lead
you
to
say
at
that
point
they
could
have
got
a
search
warrant?
when
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
the
second
day
or
third
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
out
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
at
night?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
customary
to
have
the
search
warrant
state
when
it
made
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
i
don't
understand
if
i
did
understand
you
correctly,
the
government's
defense
here
is
that
if
you
have
a
warrant
of
arrest,
incidentally,
you
may
search.
that
is
--
the
case
doesn't
present
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
but
how
does
that
help
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
wait
until
they
say
but
what
you're
--
what
--
i
asked
this
question
because
i
know
what
you
arguable
--
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
argument
is.
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
the
rabinowitz
case
says,
having
a
warrant
of
arrest,
you
may
incidentally
search.
here,
you
have
no
warrant
of
arrest,
though
the
premise
of
the
rabinowitz
case
is
out
but
because
if
you
have
a
warrant,
you
may
search
without
a
search
warrant.
in
this
case,
you
could
have
arrested
without
a
warrant
of
arrest
therefore,
you
can
also
search.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
something
else
that
--
i
followed
but
i
wondered
if
you
--
you're
free
to
argue,
mainly,
that
the
unreasonable
of
the
fourth
amendment
relates
not
unreasonable
in
abstract
or
that
is
if
it,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
world
outside,
bear
unreasonable
or
reasonable.
you
say
the
unreasonableness
is
related
to
what
it
is
you're
getting
search
warrant
for.
is
that
what
you've
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that.
but
is
that
what
the
case
has
thus
far
allow
you
to
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
--
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
the
cases
do
not
justify
government's
accuse
to
stand
on
the
case
that
you're
arguing?
you
may
consider
whether
or
not
it
was
unreasonable
or
reasonable
not
with
the
presupposition
with
the
starting
point
that
if
you
can,
you
must
get
a
search
warrant,
but
in
the
context
of
what
took
place,
forget
all
about
the
fourth
amendment,
or
this
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
search.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
saying,
isn't
--
isn't
that
what
the
case
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
talk
of
the
cases
and
this
court
upheld
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
if
you
don't
start
out
at
the
necessity
of
getting
your
search
warrant,
if
it's
feasible
to
do
so,
what
you'd
consider
independently
of
all
that
was
this
a
reasonable
or
an
unreasonable
search
in
relation
to
what
they
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i'm
suggesting
to
you
if
the
case
is,
if
i
understand
it,
allow
the
government
to
say
you
don't
start
out
with
the
duty
to
get
a
search
warrant
if
you
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
rabinowitz?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rabinowitz
made
it
reasonable
because
you
had
a
warrant
of
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
getting
the
right
to
search.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore
--
therefore
it
negative
the
requirements
that
you
urge,
namely,
you
have
to
consider
whether
they
can
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
they
can,
then
they
can't
search
without
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
how
does
the
fact
that
you
can
arrest,
give
them
leave
to
disregard
the
requirement
of
getting
a
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
doesn't
the
case
hold
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rabinowitz.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
it
hold?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we're
seeing
the
same
thing.
what
do
you
mean
by
incidental?
it
means
if
you
can
arrest,
you
don't
have
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes,
but
it
means
that
if
you
can
make
a
valid
arrest,
you
don't
have
to
bother
about
a
search
warrant.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
requirement
of
getting
a
search
warrant
if
you
can
is
not
the
doctrine
of
this
court
according
to
the
cases
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
nothing.
but
bearing
on
the
unreasonableness,
the
fact
that
you
get
a
search
warrant
isn't
relevant,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
reasonableness
unrelated
to
your
opportunity
or
rather
the
opportunity
of
the
law
which
is
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
according
to
the
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wasn't
all
has
been
--
what
you've
just
said,
all
been
set
(inaudible)
as
well
in
a
number
of
dissenting
opinions
and
are
you
asking
the
court
to
overrule
the
cases
in
which
those
are
dissenting
views
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rather
than
court
views?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
we
have
to
overrule
anything
besides
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
for
your
purposes
but
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
according
to
the
due
regard
for
what
has
been
said
here
before?
isn't
it
enough
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
if
they
acted
on
what
the
court
has
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
--
does
it
make
any
difference
this
was
contraband?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
if
--
if
the
record
discloses
or
a
--
a
judicial
notice
of
it.
this
was
a
farmhouse
near
dawsonville.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
get
the
--
was
there
a
united
states
commissioner
at
dawsonville?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
where
was
the
united
states
commissioner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
nearest
access
to
this
farmhouse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
of
course
had
cars,
did
they,
the
federal
officers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
left
me
--
you
left
me
in
doubt
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
your
answer
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
to
the
chief
justice,
namely,
are
you
saying
there
was
no
breaking
in
the
circumstance
on
the
fact
of
this
case
or
are
you
saying
that
this
--
they
had
a
lawful
right
to
enter.
you
did
no
more,
of
course,
that
was
necessary
to
make
the
arrest.
you
don't
have
to
bother
about
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
breaking,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
you
don't
have
to
enter
to
a
colloquy
between
you
and
justice
brennan
of
what
--
what
constitutes
a
breaking
is
from
your
point
of
view
to
be
irrelevant,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it
is
irrelevant,
then
the
first
thing
here
then
--
then
you
maybe
--
you
may
have
to
take
that
other
sense
you
drew
up.
but
the
first
thing
on
which
you
stand,
i
gather
therefore
as
an
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
that
whatever
it
may
be
denominated
is
before
--
to
be
determined
nearly
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
a
breaking,
you
don't
have
to
pass
on
it.
you
will
have
to
take
the
position,
because
you
justify
that
the
lawful
entry
to
make
a
lawful
arrest,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
understand
that
the
--
or
defending
a
case
or
this
particular
case.
okay,
this
is
my
position
but
even
if
you
--
the
court
goes
against
me
and
then
move
on
to
the
next
one.
but
i
do
submit
the
importance
of
the
clarity
of
understanding
not
to
mix
the
two
up
and
say,
because
i
understood
to
take
the
position,
one,
we
don't
have
to
consider
breaking
in
this
case
in
view
of
the
fact
of
the
circumstances
of
the
entry
for
the
purpose
of
the
arrest
is
lawful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
then
move
on
however
and
say,
if
the
court's
(inaudible)
goes
against
me
on
that,
i
contend
in
the
alternative
that
in
fact
there
was
no
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
believe
this
position
of
yours.
i
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
kept
apart.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
grimm,
your
time
is
nearly
up
and
you
haven't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
me
is
the
most
important
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'd
like
to
point
it.
is
it
the
comment
or
in
relation
to
a
phrase
that
you've
just
used
a
minute
that
you
mentioned
before,
having
gone
in
there,
having
entered,
was
viewed
to
arresting
somebody
who
they
have
the
right
to
arrest
with
probable
cause.
you
used
the
word,
the
phrase,
“they
came
upon
the
things
that
they
seized,”
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
they
come
upon
them
then
in
the
sense
which
come
upon
means
something
that
they
had
to
find
unexpected,
a
revelation
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
not
a
fact
that
for
two
days,
they
had
probable
cause
on
the
basis
of
which
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right,
that
they
did
had
probable
cause
for
two
days
to
go
to
a
commissioner
and
get
a
search
warrant,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
and
--
and
when
did
they
begin
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
give
me
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
had
the
whole
night,
whatever
that
was,
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
day.
so
that
for
a
full
day,
they
could
have
brought
them
--
held
within
the
fourth
amendment,
namely,
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
securing
their
person,
how
could
a
state
in
effect,
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure?
the
government
interfered
with
cases
and
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
the
court
i
think
has
taken
that
brief
out
of
context
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
shall
not
be
violated
as
no
warrant
shall
issue.
in
other
words,
warrant
appears
there
for
the
first
time
in
relation
to
what
we
preceded,
namely,
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
is
something
by
which
no
warrant
was
issued
because
it
says
there,
no
warrant
shall
issue.
that's
the
way
to
avoid
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
except
in
the
restricted
and
limited,
and
closely
confined
situation
of
necessity
where
you
couldn't
get
a
warrant
issued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
said
they
came
upon
it?
i
point
it
to
you
that
they
had
(inaudible)
a
day,
a
whole
day
which
they
could
have
gone
to
the
very
(inaudible)
and
got
to
this
farm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
think
it
came
upon
as
a
rather
--
may
i
say
loosely
of
describing
their
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
case,
that
was
all
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
that
i'm
entirely
--
i
think
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
--
actually,
i
won't
say
it
fairly
because
i
assumed
counsel
--
i
assumed
the
counsel
(inaudible)
in
answering
the
question.
i
think
it's
accurate
and
that's
why
i
question
your
--
your
petition
here,
it's
the
argument
yesterday
in
asking
him
whether
he's
asking
us
to
overrule
or
whether
he
is
standing
on
the
cases
that
has
been
decided
because
i
think
you're
quite
right
in
making
the
comment
that
was
made.
but
i
wish
to
add
to
that
that
in
the
field
which
--
in
which
there
has
been
so
much
conflict,
such
conflict
within
the
court.
i
respect
the
decision
as
long
as
it
stands.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
problem
as
to
which
it
has
been
continuous
difficulty
and
difference
in
the
court.
and
therefore,
i
suggest
that
the
government
ought
to
be
prepared
to
defend
their
position
and
not
here
withstand
on
the
immediate
result
of
a
contested
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
we
reject
that
they
were
entitled
to
stand
on
it,
if
it's
covered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
mean
the
implication
of
what
we've
just
said,
if
isn't
it,
that
although
they
could
have
searched
and
seized
more
particularly
to
the
extent
that
it
was
done
in
this
case
as
an
incident,
in
the
government's
point
of
view,
before
there
was
an
arrest,
assume
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
opportunity
or
that
right
is
denied
or
simply,
it
doesn't
come
into
play,
is
there
a
matter
of
fact,
before
the
necessity
for
making
the
arrest,
they
could
have
got
a
search
warrant
to
search
and
seize
what
they
did
into
that
search?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
