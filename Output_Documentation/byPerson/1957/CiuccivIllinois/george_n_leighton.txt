mr.
george
n.
leighton
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
grant
of
certiorari
to
review
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
which
the
conviction
of
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
was
affirmed
and
a
death
sentence
imposed.
the
federal
question
which
is
presented
here
is
whether
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
a
state
can
construe
the
alleged
criminal
acts
of
a
defendant
so
as
to
indict
him
under
four
separate
indictments,
try
him
four
times
introducing
in
evidence
against
him
the
same
proof
showing
that
he
committed
four
offenses
which
the
state
contends
are
distinct
crimes.
now,
if
i
may
be
allowed
a
moment
to
state
the
facts
of
which
this
question
arises,
if
your
honors
please.
vincent
ciucci
was
indicted
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
charged
with
the
murder
of
his
wife
and
three
children
and
the
incident
giving
rise
to
the
indictments
occurred
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
december
5,
1953
when
his
home
was
discovered
on
fire.
the
firemen
found
his
wife
and
his
three
children
dead
in
the
little
home
they
occupied
as
part
of
a
store
that
was
owned
and
operated
by
the
ciucci
family.
ciucci
first
was
indicted
separately
for
the
murder
of
his
wife
and
he
was
tried
in
a
separate
trial
and
he
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
20
years
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary.
the
state
of
illinois
does
not
contradict
the
facts
that
at
that
first
trial
there
was
introduced
in
evidence
all
of
the
facts
showing
the
killing
of
four
persons.
the
jury
considered
all
these
evidence
and
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
sentenced
ciucci
to
20
years
imprisonment
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary.
as
soon
as
that
happened
the
prosecutor
for
cook
county
announced
in
the
newspapers
that
this
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice
and
that
he,
the
prosecutor,
was
going
to
see
to
it
that
some
jury
was
found
that
would
impose
what
he
thought
was
an
adequate
penalty
for
this
crime
which
he
thought
enormous.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
are
not,
your
honor.
now,
they
proceeded
to
try
him
the
second
time
and
it
is
not
contradicted
that
at
the
second
trial,
they
introduced
the
same
proof
that
they
had
submitted
to
the
jury
in
the
first
case.
and
the
jury
again,
considered
the
evidence
from
all
that
appears
adequately
and
properly
and
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
sentenced
him
this
time
for
the
murder
of
his
oldest
daughter
angeline
to
a
term
of
45
years
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary.
contemporaneous
with
that,
the
prosecutor
announced
in
the
newspapers
that
this
also
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice
and
that
he
said,
he
thought
that
some
jury
ought
to
see
what
he
thought
in
the
matter
that
only
death
was
a
proper
penalty
for
ciucci.
now,
it
happens
that
in
the
first
trial,
they
discovered
there
was
some
inconsistency
in
the
proof.
there
was
some
question
where
these
three
persons
had
met
their
deaths
by
inhalation
of
carbon
monoxide
or
whether
they
had
come
to
their
deaths
by
shooting.
so
that,
the
state's
attorney
while
the
three
remaining
of
the
four
indictments
obtained
in
1953
remained
pending,
went
before
the
grand
jury
and
obtained
three
others.
so,
as
we
point
out
in
this
brief
at
one
time,
ciucci
had
been
under
six
separate
indictments
charging
him
with
three
separate
crimes.
in
april
of
1954
on
motion
of
the
prosecution,
three
of
the
remaining
indictments
obtained
in
1953
with
nolle
prosequi
on
motion
of
the
state
and
there
remained
the
three
indictments
obtained
in
1954.
after
the
second
trial
in
which
ciucci
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
45
years
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary,
again,
the
prosecutor
announced
this
was
not
satisfactory.
and
he
proceeded
then
to
try
him
a
third
time
under
the
indictment
charging
him
with
the
murder
of
his
son,
vincent,
jr.
this
time
when
the
trial
had
gone
on
in
a
few
days
a
mishap
occurred
and
a
mistrial
was
declared
on
motion
of
the
defendant.
and
then
the
fourth
trial
was
begun.
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
this
record,
and
certainly
all
of
us
who
have
had
experience
in
the
trial
of
criminal
cases
known,
that
by
the
simple
process
of
rearranging
the
evidence
they
finally
--
as
we
argue
here,
found
an
arrangement
of
the
evidence,
the
same
proof,
the
same
evidence,
but
a
rearrangement
of
it
by
this
experience
of
three
trials.
they
found
an
arrangement
which
convinced
the
jury
that
this
crime
was
of
the
enormity
deserving
the
extreme
penalty.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
could
be,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
could,
your
honor.
it
is
not
unusual
for
an
indictment
to
be
returned
in
which
there
will
be
one
indictment
several
counts.
it
all
arose
out
of
the
same
transaction.
they
could
have
been
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
speaking
from
personal
experience,
i
have
never
seen
one,
but
if
your
honor
--
but
it
could
be
it'll
need
a
little
more
practice.
in
fact
that's
the
point
we
make
this
case,
that's
what
should
have
been
done
in
the
case
like
this.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
sir,
i
have
been
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
don't
think
your
honor
will
find
an
answer
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
that
might
be
the
most
accurate
answer
possible
under
circumstances.
however,
i
would
say
this
to
your
honor
that
in
illinois,
under
the
illinois
criminal
law
of
practice
it
is
common
for
the
prosecutor
to
charge
in
one
indictment,
under
separate
count,
all
of
the
crimes
which
are
related
and
which
make
a
part
of
the
same
criminal
transaction.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor,
there
could
be
a
difference.
and
your
honor,
there
was
a
difference
here
and
that
is
--
and
that
i
would
like
to
say,
is
why
this
case
is
before
this
court.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
think
we'd
all
agree
with
that,
your
honor
except
that
it
sounds
a
bit
inversed
if
the
state
were
reasoning
in
that
way,
to
say
that
they
wouldn't
impose
upon
him
a
trial
in
which
there
is
alleged
in
the
indictment,
several
murders
but
then
at
the
proof
of
the
case
on
a
construction
of
a
rule
of
evidence
of
illinois
as
they
did
in
this
case
relying
on
people
versus
murphy
the
doctrine
of
res
gestae
which
is
the
knob
of
the
contention
of
the
state,
that
under
the
doctrine
of
res
gestae,
though
--
and
this
is
where
the
state's
position
in
my
judgment
is
a
--
inconsistent
and
indefensible.
they
say
on
one
hand
these
are
separate
and
distinct
crimes.
but
then
they
said,
"and
the
record
is
clear
and
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
hasn't
changed
one
with
from
the
beginning
to
the
day."
then
they
say
that
while
it
is
a
distinct
crime
we
have
the
right
to
introduce
before
a
jury
the
evidence
that
you
committed
this
great
enormous
crime
consisting
of
four
murders.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
first
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
was
in
the
third
trial.
there
was
a
mistrial
as
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
then
there
was
a
fourth
trial.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
which
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
that
if
they
have
separate
indictments
on
the
illinois
criminal
law
of
practice.
there
is
nothing
statutorial
case
law
that
prevents
that.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there
is
nothing
that
would
prevent
that
--
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
that.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
the
point,
your
honor.
but
if
at
the
trial
in
which
the
case
resulted
either
in
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction
in
which
the
same
evidence
was
introduced.
you
see
your
honor,
the
--
the
constitutional
question
arises
here,
in
my
judgment,
it
wouldn't
be
as
pointed
if
the
state
had
taken
a
consistent
position
that
these
were
distinct
crimes
and
that
he
should
have
been
tried
separately
for
these
distinct
crimes
then
punish
for
the
distinct
crimes.
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
insist
that
they
were
distinct
crimes,
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
right
to
show
in
the
jury
each
time
that
he
committed
not
only
the
crime
of
murdering
his
wife
for
which
he
was
tried
the
first
time,
not
for
the
crime
of
murdering
his
daughter
for
which
he
was
tried
the
second
time,
not
the
crime
for
murdering
his
son
which
he
was
tried
the
third
time,
but
that
he
committed
this
heinous
crime
of
wiping
out
his
family.
in
fact
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
each
--
each
time.
in
fact,
the
way
the
question
which
is
before
this
court
was
raised
was
by
a
motion
which
a
--
one
of
the
trial
attorneys
filed
raising
the
question,
and
it
was
alleged
in
allegation
which
is
not
successful
to
understanding,
and
we
cited
on
page
8
to
the
brief.
and
he
alleged
that
the
facts
and
the
evidence
upon
which
the
instant
indictment,
number
54839
is
based
are
the
same,
that
a
trial
in
this
instant
case
will
be
a
retrial
of
the
above
and
foregoing
two-named
indictment
namely
841
and
532415
which
had
been
previously
called.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
only
difference
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
only
difference
--
the
only
difference.
and
you
see,
if
i
may
press
the
point
further.
by
the
time
they
got
to
this
case,
incidentally,
they
had
gone
through
the
matter
so
often
that
they
had
finally
had,
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
one
of
the
most
experienced
prosecutors
in
cook
county.
and
the
newspaper
references
showed
that
mr.
sam
(inaudible)
who
had
been
in
the
state
attorney's
office
some
--
almost
30
years.
if
i'm
wrong
one
--
i
may
stand
corrected.
but
sam
(inaudible)
was
known
as
one
of
the
most
experienced
prosecutors
in
cook
county.
he'd
been
through
several
administrations
of
the
cook
county
--
of
the
state
attorney's
office.
so
that
--
it
was
by
the
rearrangement
of
proof
and
incidentally,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
we
raised
that
point,
that
it
was
this
rearrangement
of
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
they
started
off
this
time
with
putting
on
carol
amora,
the
young
girl,
whom
he
had
seduced
and
who
had
a
child
for
him.
they
had
tried
in
the
various
cases
to
put
carol
amora
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
or
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
and
in
this
trial,
they
started
off
with
carol
amora.
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
the
opinion
which
is
published
in
the
record
of
this
case,
we
pointed
out
that
in
allowing
carol
amora
to
testify
first
about
her
illicit
relationship
with
this
defendant
for
bearing
a
child,
they
even
went
to
the
point
of
bringing
out
that
he
had
swindled
her
out
of
$300
to
buy
a
cadillac.
they
started
off
with
that
frame
of
mind
on
the
jury
that
he
was
not
a
murderer
but
as
the
state's
attorney
said
before
the
supreme
court,
a
stinger,
a
rocker,
that's
how
they
started
the
fourth
and
final
trial.
in
that
tone,
this
was
not
a
man
who
had
the
innocence
of
heart
to
wipe
out
his
family
but
a
man
also,
who
would
seduce
a
young
girl
of
18.
that's
how
they
started
the
fourth
trial,
by
this
rearrangement
of
proof.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
they
do
in
illinois.
now,
if
he
were
tried
in
the
fashion,
your
honor's
suggestion,
your
honor's
hypothetical
case,
he
would
give
--
be
given
one
sentence
in
a
manner
informed
as
charged
in
the
indictment
and
he
would
be
sentenced
for
the
crime
charged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
statute
in
illinois
so
provided.
however
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
there
are
decisions
on
that
for
which
i
cannot
give,
your
honor,
one
right
at
this
moment.
however,
i
would
say
this.
the
custom
in
practice
in
--
under
illinois
criminal
law
in
such
a
case
as,
your
honor
puts,
is
to
impose
if
there
are
separate
findings
of
guilty
as
to
each
count.
if
there
are,
is
to
impose
sentences
on
those
findings
to
run
as
a
rule
concurrent
with.
now,
that
--
that's
the
usual
custom.
it
is
rare
indeed
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
requirement
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
under
the
law
of
attempt,
the
punishment
is
the
same
as
the
crime
for
which
the
--
the
attempt
was
made.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
well
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
it
will
be
a
felony
under
illinois,
punishable
under
the
code.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
without
any
limit.
now,
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
though,
so
as
i
may
not
mislead,
your
honor.
in
the
case
you
put,
now
that
i
have
understood
your
honor's
point,
there
is
nothing
to
delimit
the
court's
power
in
imposing
separate
penalties
for
each
count.
if
there
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
if
there
is
a
separate
finding.
but
there
is
this
much
to
be
said
in
illinois
practice.
there
is
a
discretion
given
to
the
court
to
compel
an
election.
you
see,
your
honor
the
question
you
put
brings
up
the
question
which
is
raised
here.
if
this
procedure
were
followed
in
the
ciucci
case,
then
ciucci
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
moved
to
compel
the
state
to
have
elected
on
which
count
they
were
proceeding,
and
then
the
question
could
have
been
raised,
he
would
have
had
his
hearing
right
there
and
then
as
to
that.
all
the
procedural
safeguards
against
the
multiplicity
of
prosecutions
would
have
been
afforded
him
if
such
a
--
a
proceeding
had
been
instituted
by
the
state
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
but,
your
honor,
in
this
case
we
also
have
the
question
which
we
raised
here.
that
this
is
not
the
exercise
of
the
sovereign
power
of
illinois
to
correct
what
is
considered
to
be
a
criminal
act.
this
is
an
arbitrary
use
of
state
power
because
it
would
be
just
as
if
any
state
officer
should
decide
to
arbitrarily
or
discriminatorily
impose
a
state
act
against
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
without
going
through
the
details,
your
honors
have
held
consistently,
that
an
arbitrary
discriminate
use
of
state
power
against
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
so
as
deprive
him
of
his
life
liberty
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
this
case
puts
out
the
fact
that
ciucci
was
treated
in
a
manner
solely
to
obtain
the
extreme
penalty
and
that
he
was
tried
several
times
and
because
the
prosecutor
had
in
his
mind
that
the
only
way
to
punish
this
man
is
to
put
him
to
death.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
your
honor
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
if
the
jury
--
if
the
case
is
--
it's
a
trial
by
jury,
the
jury
fixes
the
penalty
in
murder.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
your
honor.
in
illinois
in
--
for
trial
for
murder
and
if
it's
tried
by
the
court,
it's
for
the
court
to
set
the
penalty.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
they're
all
tried
by
jury.
now
within
the
time
allotted
to
me,
i
would
like
to
go
to
what
strikes
me
as
a
persuasive
point
in
these
cases.
authorities
on
the
subject,
students
of
this
subject
have
asked
the
question,
"why
is
it
that
in
civil
proceeding
we
don't
allow
a
party
who
has
a
cause
of
action
against
another
party
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction
to
chop
up
his
cause
of
action
and
try
it
at
his
own
whim
and
go
on
before
one
jury
and
rearranging
his
proof
at
his
own
discretion
and
his
own
arraignment?"
we
don't
do
that.
in
fact
it
is
almost
consistent
throughout
the
country
that
in
civil
cases
we
require
the
individual
with
a
--
with
a
cause
of
action
to
bring
his
case
at
that
time,
otherwise,
he
shall
be
barred
under
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
now,
the
question
i
raise
in
this
case,
why
should
the
state
of
illinois
have
greater
rights
than
individual
members
of
its
sovereign
body?
what
is
it
about
the
criminal
law
administration
that
will
allow
a
--
a
digression
from
what
is
uniformly
considered?
just
a
simple
fairness,
that
if
you
have
a
case
against
the
man
bring
it
all
at
one
time
so
you
may
have
his
one
day
in
court
and
defend
himself.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
is
true,
your
honor.
now,
we
say
that
the
case
here
where
one
is
put
against
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state,
that
he
should
be
treated
in
a
manner
consistent
with
fairness,
and
consistent
with
fairness
within
the
concepts
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
but
i
say
that
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
it
was
the
use
by
him,
a
state
officer
of
the
state
prosecution
power
in
this
way
that
denies
the
petitioner
the
protection
of
the
law
that
we
now
assert
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
protection.
now,
i
have
elected,
if
your
honors
please,
to
reserve
10
minutes
for
rebuttal
as
i
understand
my
time.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
all
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
if
your
honor
please.
in
answer
to
the
question
put
to
mr.
wines
by
mr.
justice
whittaker.
if
your
honor
please,
the
proof
in
the
record
as
to
the
deaths
of
the
other
members
of
the
petitioner's
family
went
even
to
the
point
of
the
embalming
of
the
body.
the
record
shows
that
each
one
of
these
bodies
were
taken
out
of
this
home
by
a
different
fireman,
and
i
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
that
since
that
was
the
case,
this
was
not
a
case
which
the
death
of
one
had
to
be
shown
to
prove
the
death
of
another
because
the
bodies
were
taken
out
of
the
room
separately.
they
even
went
to
the
point
of
showing
how
much
embalming
fluid
they
put
into
the
seven-year-old
child.
they
went
through
all
the
gory
details,
revolting
and
all
that.
they
--
they
proved
every
--
even
down
to
the
point
of
how
much
--
how
much
embalming
fluid
necessary
to
embalm
the
body
of
the
little
girl.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
you
see,
your
honor
there
was
--
there's
nothing
--
under
illinois
criminal
practice,
the
prosecution
could
not
show
that
unless
he
took
the
stand.
they
couldn't
show
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
prior
offense
unless
he
testified
so
that
at
the
second
trial,
and
at
the
third
trial,
and
at
the
fourth
trial,
he,
of
course,
remained
from
the
witness
stand.
because
as
we
point
out
in
this
brief
you
can
see
the
effect
upon
the
jury
of
being
told
that
this
defendant
killed
the
mother
of
this
child
for
whom
he's
being
prosecuted.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
mr.
justice
--
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
if
this
petitioner
had
been
represented
at
the
trial
by
in
an
astute
counsel
who
could
see
the
point
that,
your
honor
raised.
you
see,
your
honor
it
would
take
a
lot
of
--
it
would
take
a
lot
of
trial
court
courage
in
representing
a
man
before
a
jury
for
murder.
to
prove
that
he
had
been
convicted
twice,
it
would
be
stroke
of
genius
of
advocacy,
it
would
be
an
amazing
amount
of
perception.
and
i
suppose
that
one
would
say
now
in
retrospect
that
perhaps,
that
was
the
thing
to
do,
but
it
would
take
on
a
kind
of
ability
for
a
trial
counsel
that
this
petitioner
couldn't
afford
by
the
time
he
was
tried
in
this
case.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
your
honor,
that
can
only
be
done
by
inference
from
the
record
and
i
took
the
liberty
in
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
think
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
from
the
record
itself,
the
contention
made
in
the
trial
court,
that
he
was
being
prosecuted
successively
by
a
prosecutor
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
extreme
penalty.
the
question
raised
by
motion.
i
simply
took
the
liberty
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no
--
no,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think
i
should
make
it
very
clear,
your
honor,
that
these
statements
of
the
prosecutor
were
not
made
during
trial.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
were
made
outside.
they
were
made
soon
after
the
defendant
was
tried
and
convicted
the
first
time.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
then
there
--
then
there
was
a
big
lapse
of
time,
then
he
was
tried
the
second
time,
then
after
he
was
convicted
the
second
time
and
sentenced
to
45
years.then
the
state
was
again
--
then
there
was
a
big
lapse
of
time.
you
see
this
is
not
the
case
of
a
statement
that
the
prosecutor
made
during
trial
or
just
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
just
a
matter
of
taking
into
account
the
entire
total
aura
of
this
case.
now
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
from
the
facts
of
the
prosecution,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
what
i
know
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
they
did,
your
honor.
all
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
there's
--
there's
no
rule
of
court
to
which
i
can
point
to,
as
you
all
know,
nor
is
there
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor
we
did
not.
we
did
not.
that
precise
question,
don't
put
that
way
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
we
had
raised
the
federal
question
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
and
i
might
add
to
inform
the
court
that
i
did
not
represent
this
man
at
the
trial.
i
undertook
to
represent
him
after
his
conviction.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that
the
multiplicity
of
the
--
of
the
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
as
such.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
now,
if
your
honor
observed
in
--
on
page
9
of
the
brief,
on
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
again,
we
made
a
claim,
what
was
the
federal
constitution
question
being
urged.
now,
i
will
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
on
page
9
of
petitioner's
brief.
see,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
cited
people
versus
allen
as
the
sole
authority
for
denying
the
constitutional
question.
and
i
have
not
had
the
time,
but
i
think
it's
quite
plain
to
your
honor,
that
people
versus
allen
is
not
authority
for
the
proposition
which
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
cited
it.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
not
the
earlier
trial.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
your
honor,
it
is
very
clear
that
at
this
present
trial,
the
prosecutor
made
no
comment
about
the
prior
conviction.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
there
was
nothing
said
about
those.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no.
under
illinois
practice,
that
would
have
been
a
reversible
error.
the
supreme
of
illinois
would
have
reversed.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
there
isn't
anything
like
that.
i'm
sure
there
isn't.
i
might
say
in
frankness
to
the
court,
that
this
appendage
to
this
petition
was
my
idea
in
--
in
bringing
before
this
court
the
detail
as
to
the
--
the
forces
behind
this
prosecution.
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
mr.
wines
and
mr.
wines
said
he
doesn't
remember
any
such
case
in
which
any
man
had
been
treated
in
this
fashion.
now,
mr.
wines
could
remember
there
was
a
case
in
illinois
which
a
man
set
a
fire
to
several
buildings
and
killed
eleven
people.
he
was
indicted
eleven
times,
he
went
into
trial
once,
on
the
second
trial
when
he
came
up,
he
pled
double
jeopardy
and
the
plea
was
sustained.
the
states
attorney
of
cook
county
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
error
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
dismissed
the
writ
of
error
saying
that
while
the
plea
may
not
have
been
signed,
there
was
no
writ
of
error
to
review,
sustaining
of
a
plea
of
double
jeopardy
under
illinois
practice
by
the
prosecution.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
your
honor,
he
was
tried
in
1953.
the
fire
--
the
first
trial
was
in
1953.
he
was
--
the
fire
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
the
occurrence
december
5,
1953.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
he
was
--
he
was
tried
during
the
latter
part
of
december
1953.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
well,
a
short
time.
it
was
short
then
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
your
honor.
no
--
no,
it's
not.
not
for
murder
cases.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh,
yes.
there
was
--
mr.
george
n.
leighton
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
now,
if
your
honor
will
allow
me
just
to
say
this
final
word.
you
see
these
statements
that
we
make
point
of
here
were
not
made
in
connection
with
the
intended
first
prosecution.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
oh,
yes
--
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
yes.
mr.
george
n.
leighton
that's
right.
now,
in
the
final
word,
in
mr.
wines'
comment
about
the
english-speaking
world,
i
don't
think
mr.
wines'
research
would
reveal
one
single
case
in
which
a
defendant
had
been
tried
in
a
series
of
prosecutions
and
in
which
the
same
evidence
was
introduced
against
him
in
this
manner,
and
that
is
why
we
raised
the
federal
question.
thank
you,
your
honor.
