justice
felix
frankfurter
in
illinois,
according
to
illinois
law,
could
there
have
been
a
trial
for
the
death
of
all
the
victims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
could
have
tried
for
the
prosecution
for
the
death
of
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
normally
so.
i
wondered
if
--
i'm
asking
whether
they
saw
there's
a
capital
offence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
there
--
there
must
be
--
if
there's
no
statutory
disposition
of
the
question.
there's
no
statute
in
illinois
which
gives
an
answer
to
my
question.
in
case
you
give
an
answer
to
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
no
enactment
of
the
state
legislature,
which
gives
me
an
answer
to
that
question,
would
i
find
an
answer
in
some
of
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
the
answers
--
i
quote
the
answers
and
you
can't
answer
it,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
see
a
difference
in
that
rule
with
reference
to
charges
of
murder.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
--
it
--
it
may
make
a
difference
from
the
out
--
and
i
don't
say
it
is.
i
haven't
--
there's
nothing
on
that.
but
i
should
think
we
have
one
question.
if
a
state
says
"in
fairness
to
the
defendant,
we
do
not
allow
him
to
be
charged
with
the
murder
of
more
than
one
human
being,
and
that
he
can't
be
put
on
trial
for
the
murder
of
two
people
before
that
may
have,"
--
i
should
think
it
might
easily
have
"a
prejudicial
influence
upon
the
jury
as
against
the
state
who
does
allow
such
a
trial,
chooses
not
to
try
the
defendant
that
way
but
chooses
to
try
him
in
possession
if
he
commits
more
than
one
murder."
i'd
like
to
submit
the
court
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
understand
--
did
i
understand
on
the
first
trial
there
was
a
disagreement
of
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
there
is
a
disagreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
then
a
fourth
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
who
was
tried
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
my
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposed
they
had
a
state
of
(inaudible)
in
my
mind,
suppose
the
state
claims
that
there
were
four
murders
committed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
roughly
speaking,
in
--
on
one
occasion,
one
temporal
unit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
within
one
temporal
unit,
and
suppose
at
the
trial
for
the
murder
of
a
and
the
jury
disagrees,
i
take
it
under
illinois
law
there
could
be
a
retrial
for
murder
of
a.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
state
say,
"well,
it
will
not
rhyme
for
the
murder
of
b."
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there's
a
mistrial
and
both
the
jury
disagreed
as
to
c,
the
then
crime
for
the
murder
of
c
under
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say,
but
you
say,
that
if
and
either
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction
that
as
it
were
liquidates
the
affair?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
that's
bearing
on
--
your
to
enlighten
my
mind
on
singular
against
collective
offenses.
suppose
he
had
attempted
to
murder
--
the
part
that
they
should
meet
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposed
he'd
attempted
to
murder
his
family,
wife
and
three
children,
and
he
had
failed
in
his
purpose
but
they
were
all
injured
so
that
there's
manslaughter
or
some
other
--
a
high
degree
of
that
whatever
it
should
be
called
in
illinois,
under
the
illinois
penal
code,
as
i
understood
you,
certainly
as
to
those
cases
there
could
be
trial
of
all
four
before
the
attack
on
all
four,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
you
mind
expressing
your
view
whether
there
could
be
punishment,
accumulated
punishment
for
each
of
the
victims
could
pose
the
maximum
was
10
years
for
the
particular
offense
that
the
court
give
a
sentence
of
40
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
makes
you
say
that?
is
there
some
decision
of
illinois
which
says,
if
a
person
by
one
comprehensive
deed,
brings
injury,
violence,
mens
rea
injury
to
for
four
people
we
cannot
be
given
more
than
the
maximum
of
one
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
any
decision
that
should
be
right
on
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
doubt
a
court
--
no
doubt
a
court,
i
suppose
can
do
that.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
the
requirements
of
illinois
law
are,
limiting
that
power
or
allowing
a
trial
judge
to
make
accumulate
--
give
accumulated
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
if
he
puts
forth
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
before
(inaudible)
et
cetera,
attempted
--
take
attempted
murder.
what
is
the
punishment
of
illinois
for
attempted
murder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
is
death
for
attempted
murder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
sounds
shocking
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
limit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
filing
them
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
lots
of
--
there
are
lots
of
things
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
that
a
humane
and
wise
system
would
enforce
by
a
state
law
the
absolute
which
doesn't
make
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
all
the
things
you've
indicated
that
are
maybe
your
prosecution-elect
or
looking
in
the
direction
not
multiplying.
but
we're
here
concerned
as
well,
whatever
maybe
illinois
law,
in
her
own
good
or
bad
wisdom,
it
--
it
transgresses
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
all
turns
on
what
the
--
the
case
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
have
--
you're
going
back
to
your
original
starting
point
as
to
what
the
case
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
your
case,
in
view
what
you
said
earlier,
your
position
is
that
in
this
case,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
in
view
of
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
in
his
behavior,
all
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
saying
or
are
you
saying
that
if
by
one
comprehensive
act
for
dealing,
for
things
that
the
state
of
illinois
says,
that
it
was
being
singled,
constitutes
a
crime,
must
be
tried
all
in
one
case.
you're
not
saying
that,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
--
that
the
--
the
particular
relation
what
the
district
attorney
or
whatever
he
is
called,
a
prosecutor
here
did
and
the
way
he
managed
these
prosecutions,
these
successive
prosecutions,
that
that's
what
--
that's
the
problem
in
the
view
of
the
complainant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wines,
may
i
put
this
to
you,
if
you
consider
it
sometime
before
you
sit
down
that,
argumentatively,
let
me
see
if
i
can
state
on.
there
it
denies,
considering
the
fact
the
hoag
case
is
still
before
us
and
the
case
of
--
of
an
acquittal,
there
is
the
argument
of
--
of
the
hazard
to
the
jury
trial
etcetera,
etcetera.
but
if
there
is
a
conviction
and
the
state
tries
again,
a
conviction
in
which
the
sentence
was
short
of
the
ultimate
sentence
and
then
is
there
an
escape
from
the
consideration.
i'm
not
saying
it's
controlling
of
what
he
does,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
there
was
an
escape
from
the
consideration
that
by
retrying,
having
had
guilt
established
but
a
lower
sentence
in
the
alternate
sentence,
the
state
is
really
complaining
or
not
satisfied
that
does
what
it
does
however,
you
choose
to
put
it
because
it
isn't
satisfied
with
the
heaviness
of
the
sentence.
isn't
that
what
--
is
there
an
inference
unentitiled
necessarily
to
draw.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
reasonably
sensibly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sensibly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
state
is
really
--
the
state
wants
to
get
another
crack
at
getting
a
heavier
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
use
of
algorithm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
changes
your
position.
it
was
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
difference,
that's
the
whole
point.
if
--
if
a
jury
has
it
within
its
power,
it
has
in
so
many
states
including
illinois,
to
say,
"no.
we
don't
want
to
send
this
fellow
to
death
and
we
merely
give
him
a
life
sentence,"
is
not
a
fair,
sensible
in
this
limited
powerful
world
of
ours.
is
it
a
fair
inference
for
me
to
say
that
what
the
state
is
about
--
going
to
get
a
death
sentence
although
the
jury
merely
gave
a
life
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
get
two
deaths
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wines,
would
you
state
with
your
customary
fairness
as
you
will,
as
one
who
is
much
interested
in
these
aspects
of
these
cases.
how
much
publicity
was
there
about
all
this
business
and
how
much
public
addressing
as
it
were
was
there
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
he's
after.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
--
there
was
no
motion
made
by
mr.
leighton
in
which
this
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
any
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
case
in
connection
with
the
mail
bag
case
is?
what
cases
in
this
court,
mr.
wine,
or
cases
that
raised
not
the
question
of
accumulated
sentence
but
successive
trials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
mail
--
the
mail
and
narcotic.
you
had
none
of
the
successive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
wines
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
express
your
view
as
to
the
extent
to
which,
if
it
all,
the
conduct
of
the
public
utterances
of
the
prosecutor
relevantly
to
be
taken
into
account
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
--
at
no
time
--
was
this
the
first
time
that
the
mention
was
made
to
this
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
counsel
--
did
he
have
counsel
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
same
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
court
appointed
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
assuming
you
have
a
right
to
--
you
have
a
right
to
urge
if
we
can,
we
must
be
unmindful
of
it,
but
assuming
it
were
in
the
record
and
not
merely
printed
in
the
book,
what
would
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
way,
you
--
you
candidly
--
i
think,
it
answered
justice
harlan
in
that
question
correctly
to
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
go
on
from
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
--
you
make
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
successive,
weren't
they?
according
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
this
matter
before
the
supreme
court
of
your
state,
the
conduct
of
the
prosecutor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
other
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question
whether
there
could
have
been
one
prosecution
for
all
four
deaths?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be
tried
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
covered
a
good
deal
of
territory.
you
--
you
said
in
the
--
i
can
get
what
your
phrase
was,
your
opening
--
the
whole
--
the
jurisprudence
of
the
whole
english-speaking
world
support
your
position,
is
that
right?
something
like
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
is
--
are
there
decisions
in
the
different
jurisdictions,
british
commonwealth
on
--
are
they
on
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
in
the
48
states
have
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
canvassed
all
the
--
all
the
adjudications
there
are
on
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
you
--
have
you
tried
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
enumerated
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
on
mr.
leighton's
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
leighton,
will
you
please
tell
me
how
i
can
take
note
of
the
behavior
of
which
you
now
complain
of
the
prosecutor
on
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
will
be
the
basis
of
the
inference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
perfectly
ready
to
draw
inferences
that
the
reasoning
power
from
this
one
to
draw
from
what
appears
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
--
where
was
it?
the
prosecutor
said
that
to
whom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
jury
in
order
to
get
a
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
they
were
made
outside.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
you're
complaining
of
those
you
hear,
urged
those
statements,
if
i
understand
it,
as
an
evidence
of
the
state
of
mind
as
a
conduct
of
the
prosecutor
in
securing
the
conviction
that
he
did
secure
which
is
the
only
thing
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
death
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i'm
asking
is,
how
can
i
take
if
you
give
me
the
basis
for
allowable
consideration
of
those
successive
statements
by
the
prosecutor
that
he's
going
to
persist
in
this
until
an
understanding
from
his
point
of
view,
until
an
effective
jury
brings
in
the
death
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
well
--
but
aura
implies
something.
now,
where
--
where
can
i
-
-and
what
can
i
--
on
what
basis
can
i
find
this
aura
which
gives
me
any
kind
of
indication
that
those
were
the
considerations
that
underlay
the
fourth
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mere
fact
of
the
prosecutor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
enable
me
to
--
to
treat
these
statements
which
you've
appended,
as
i
understand
it,
i
looked
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
public
utterances
in
the
chicago
press,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably,
read
that
they
appear
in
all
the
papers
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
asking
me
to
take
into
account
as
an
element
in
the
--
what
does
or
doesn't
amount
to
due
process,
that
the
prosecutor
was
bent
on
getting
a
death
sentence.
and
i'm
asking
you,
on
what
take
can
i
take
notice
of
those
statements,
handle
statements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
the
--
was
your
position
--
what
was
your
position
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
such
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
he
was
finally,
he
was
sentenced
to
death
in
a
trial
when
there
had
been
three
preceding
trials
of
convictions
for
other
victims,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
9?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rather
end
up
with
the
wrong
concerning
which
the
defendant
complained
and
before
that,
you
do
not
consider
determinative,
the
constitutional
question
that
defendant's
case
does
not
fall
into
the
established
rules
of
double
jeopardy.
the
gravamen
of
the
wrong
concerning
which
the
defendant
complained
was
the
multiple
forms
of
prosecution
against
it,
elected
by
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
so
far
as
you
candidly
stated,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
enables
me
to
go
outside,
that
statement
of
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
trouble
you
to
state,
how
soon
after
the
crime,
the
prosecution
got
under
--
how
soon
was
the
first
trial
after
this
affair?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
occurrence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
