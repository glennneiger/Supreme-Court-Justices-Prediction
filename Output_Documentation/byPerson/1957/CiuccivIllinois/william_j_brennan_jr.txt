justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
mr.
leighton
that
in
each
of
those
several
trials,
part
of
the
state's
proof
was
that,
in
fact,
there
were
four
killings
not
just
the
one
where
indictment
of
which
he
was
on
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
happened
every
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
get
this
clear.
is
that
to
say
then,
there
was
actually
no
difference
except
as
you
suggested
earlier,
perhaps,
in
the
arrangement
of
the
proofs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
proofs,
except
that
there
was
a
different
name
on
the
particular
indictment
under
trial
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
a
different
name
received?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that.
can
you
say
shortly
what
the
rearrangement
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
have
you
prosecuted
him
for
the
full
extent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
death.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
you
wanted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
more
than
a
fair
inference.
it's
--
it's
an
inevitable
inference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
though
as
i
understand
it,
the
third
trial
and
the
fourth
trial
were
for
the
same
death,
weren't
they?
in
other
words
a
mistrial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
actually
he's
never
been
tried
for
more
than
just
three
deaths?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
never
been
tried
for
the
fourth
death.
