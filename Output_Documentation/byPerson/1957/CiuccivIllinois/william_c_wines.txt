mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
your
honors,
despite
the
great
importance
of
this
case,
not
only
to
petitioner
but
in
the
field
of
constitutional
law
and
criminal
jurisprudence,
it
can
be
argued
briefly
and
simply,
and
i
know
that
i
won't
be
understood
as
deprecating
the
importance
of
the
case
if
i
do
argue
it
briefly
and
simply.
the
facts
that
give
emergence
to
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
can
be
briefly
summarized.
the
petitioner
had
been
engaged
in
an
illicit
love
affair
with
a
young
woman
by
the
name
of
carol
amora.
she
had
conceived
a
child
by
him.
he
had
been
refused
to
divorce
by
his
wife
who
would
yield
him
only
separate
maintenance.
on
the
night
in
question,
in
the
building
in
which
he
live
with
his
wife
and
three
children,
was
found
in
flames.
he
was
found
crouched
in
a
doorway.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
sorry.
he
was
found
--
the
building
in
which
they
live
was
found
in
flames.
he
was
found
crouched
in
the
doorway.
the
day
before
the
fire,
he
had
borrowed
a
22-caliber
rifle
from
a
friend
saying
that
he
wanted
to
use
it
in
hunting.
his
wife
and
three
children
were
found
dead.
apparently,
overcome
by
carbon
monoxide
asphyxiated,
but
each
of
them
had
a
hole
shot
through
his
or
her
head,
wife,
two
daughters
and
son
were
killed.
the
state
of
illinois
first
indicted
petitioner
for
the
murder
of
his
wife.
the
trial
on
that
case
ultimate
in
a
verdict,
the
jury
fixes
the
penalty
in
illinois
in
a
murder
case.
we
don't
have
degrees
of
murder
of
20
years.
he
was
subsequently
tried
before
another
jury
for
the
murder
of
his
daughter
and
was
given
20
--
that
was
given
45
years.
a
third
case
resulted
in
a
mistrial,
and
in
the
fourth
case
a
prosecution
for
the
murder
of
his
son,
the
jury
fixed
the
penalty
at
death.
petitioner
contended,
and
contends
here
that
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law
and
that
he
was
subjected
to
three
separate
prosecutions,
there
was
one
mistrial,
four
trials
but
three
separate
prosecutions,
and
presumably
would
have
faced
a
possible
fourth
prosecution
for
the
death
of
these
four
people.
he
also
contends
that
it
was
error
to
admit
in
evidence
as
to
each,
the
scene
for
which
he
was
tried,
respectively,
evidence
of
the
deaths
of
the
other
members
of
his
family
although,
all
of
them
perished
on
the
same
occasion.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
in
accordance
with
inveterate
practice
throughout
the
english-speaking
world
at
least,
where
a
defendant
kills
or
robs
or
rapes
or
otherwise
injures,
or
damnifies
four
a
separate
persons
and
is
convicted.
i
want
to
emphasize
"convicted"
for
one
of
such
damnifications,
that
conviction
does
not
bar
prosecution
for
other
injuries
to
other
people
even
though
the
transactions
are
contemporaneous.
i
will
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
think
--
it
is
a
different
case,
your
honor.
we
would
be
prepared
to
argue
as
was
argued
in
the
hoag
case
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
even
--
even
an
acquittal
would
not
bar
the
further
prosecution.
that's
an
argument
i
would
make
but
i'm
not
compelled
to
make
it
in
this
case
because
it
is
my
position,
that
even
if
an
acquittal
would
bar
a
further
prosecution.
mr.
william
c.
wines
what?
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
i
am
making
--
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
at
least
where
there
is
a
conviction
for
one
of
the
four
deaths,
robberies,
larcenies,
assaults,
rapes,
slanders
or
the
like,
at
least
in
that
case,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
bar
a
second
prosecution
even
if
it
would
bar
it
in
the
event
of
an
acquittal.
however,
even
in
the
case
of
an
acquittal
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
successive
trials
as
long
as
there
were
separate
injuries.
i
realized
that
your
honors
have
before
you
the
case
of
hoag
against
new
jersey
which
is
not,
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
been
yet
decided
by
this
court.
but
in
the
hoag
case
there
was
an
acquittal
of
the
first
robbery
and
that
poses
a
very
different
question.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
wouldn't
say
necessarily,
but
it
certainly
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
--
but
i
would
say
reasonably
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
sensibly.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
would
say
your
honor
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
your
honor
that
even
if
--
if
they
had
imposed
the
heaviest
sentence
provided
that
sentence
hasn't
been
death,
the
state
could
go
ahead
and
prosecute
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
for
--
for
the
other
crimes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
that's
a
fair
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference.
i
don't
think
it's
an
inevitable
or
necessary
inference.
the
state
attorney
might
feel
compelled
as
a
matter
of
duty
to
prosecute
for
each
of
the
separate
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
presumed
that
since
he
is
already
been
sentenced
to
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
to
death.
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
--
that
--
i
–
i
think
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
–
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
not.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
didn't
hear,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
were
four
trials,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
--
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
he's
never
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
he's
never
been
tried
for
the
fourth
death.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
record
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
record
doesn't
show,
but
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
there
was
a
good
deal.
these
excerpts
from
the
newspapers
are
not
in
the
record
but
it's
not
said
that
they're
not
in
fact
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
so
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
so
far
as
i
know
generally
speaking,
there
has
not
been.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
my
position
on
that
is
--
is
this.
we
say,
i
really
think,
that
due
process
permits
successive
trials
for
successive
deaths,
assaults,
slanders,
or
similar
offenses
against
individuals,
even
though
the
transactions
are
virtually
simultaneous
and
there
is
an
acquittal
in
the
first
or
the
first
two
or
three
of
them.
that's
the
hoag
case.
but
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
i
say
that
at
least
where
there
is
a
conviction,
the
state
has
a
right
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
more
than
one
person
has
been
damaged
and
to
inflict
successive
punishments
and
penalties
for
that
injury.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
aren't
too
many
decisions
of
this
court
directly
on
the
point
but
i
will
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
case
of
flemister
against
the
united
states
cited
and
discussed
in
our
briefs
in
207
united
states,
a
unanimous
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
that
case
arose
in
the
philippine
islands.
the
accused
had
struck
a
policeman
and
simultaneously
assaulted
another
public
official.
he
was
tried
for
the
first
of
these
offenses,
punished,
tried
for
the
second,
pleaded
in
effect
double
jeopardy
and
mr.
justice
holmes
is
writing
for
a
unanimous
court
sustained
both
convictions
and
held
that
there
was
no
infraction
of
the
due
process
clause.
a
similar
result
was
reached
in
the
hotema
case,
that's
a
little
different.
there
the
defendant
was
indicted
for
killing
three
persons
on
the
same
day.
in
two
trials,
he
was
found
to
have
been
insane,
in
the
third
trial
he
was
found
to
be
sane,
and
this
court
rejected
as
"wholly
without
merit"
the
plea
of
"once
in
jeopardy."
your
honors
have
in
mind
other
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
the
recent
arguments
in
this
case,
your
honors
have
in
mind
the
mail
bag
cases
where
a
man
who
slits
several
mail
bags
even
though
at
the
same
time
has
been
held
punishable
for
each
of
those
offenses,
and
your
honors
have
mind
the
cases
in
which
it
has
been
held
that
both
the
state
and
federal
government
may
prosecute
for
the
same
--
or
virtually
the
same
act.
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
philippine
case
was
successive.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
that's
one.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
now,
we
say
this,
very
earnestly,
your
honors,
that
while
due
process
is
a
steadily
evolving
concept,
there
are
guides
of
history
and
it
has
been
as
we
all
know
the
welna
universal
consensus
throughout
the
english-speaking
world
that
a
man
who
kills
more
than
one
person
is
subject
to
several
punishments.
states
don't
deny
due
process
of
law
when
even
though
there
may
be
some
tincture
or
parodistic
nature
of
vengeance
in
the
sentence,
they
punish
several
offenses.
i
have
in
mind
the
case
that
we're
all
familiar
with
which
did
not
reach
this
court
at
least
certiorari
wasn't
granted
where
a
man
blew
up
an
airplane
and
killed
40
passengers.
now,
we
say
that
there
is
nothing
so
shocking
to
the
universal
sense
of
justice
about
prosecuting
that
man
for
a
more
than
one
of
those
deaths
as
wouldn't
deny
due
process
of
law.
it
might
be
that
there's
much
to
be
said
--
i
want
to
be
entirely
fair
in
arguing
with
the
court
–
for
a
system
of
jurisprudence
in
which
there
would
be
only
one
investigation
of
guilt
and
only
one
punishment
for
what
is
in
effect
one
transaction.
but
we
say,
that
a
state
doesn't
deny
due
process
of
law
when
it
applies
to
the
maximum,
if
men
will
multiply
crimes,
the
state
will
multiply
prosecutions
and
punishments.
one
other
contention
need
detain
us
for
only
a
moment.
it
is
contended
here
that
due
process
was
denied
because
on
each
of
these
trials,
the
state
was
permitted
to
show
all
four
of
the
killings
while
on
the
very
simplest
principles
of
evidence
they
were
all
part
of
the
res
gestae,
they
were
all
part
of
a
single
scheme,
they
were
all
part
of
a
single
transaction.
now,
petitioner
says,
'well,
if
you're
going
to
treat
it
that
way
for
the
purpose
of
rules
of
evidence
then
it's
all
part
of
one
transaction
for
the
purpose
of
punishment,"
we
say
that,
"it
was
not
in
accord
with
the
historic
contours
of
the
due
process
clause."
and
we
think,
that
whatever
your
honors
might
wish
to
make
the
law,
due
process
is
not
denied
by
multiple
prosecutions
for
multiple
crimes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
don't
think
they
should
be
taken
into
account
at
all
because
they're
not
a
part
of
the
record
and
after
all,
we
are
entitled
to
a
--
a
hearing
on
the
record.
but
if
they
were
a
part
of
the
record
i
would
say
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
so
far
as
i
--
so
far
as
i
know
yes,
your
honor.
they're
just
--
just
reprinted
as
--
as
appendices
to
the
petitioner's
brief
with
no
--
no
citation
to
the
record
at
all.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
had
counsel
at
all
trials,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
had
a
counsel
of
his
own
choice
in
the
first
trial
and
he
had
court-appointed
counsel
in
subsequent
trials.
i
really
am
not
sure
about
the
second
trial.
i
should
know
but
i
don't.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
the
question
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
i
don't
question
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
correctness
of
quotations
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
i
don't
want
to
be
in
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
the
error
would
not
be
such
as
to
deny
due
process.
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
matter
that
could
be
taken
care
of,
my
instructions
to
the
jury.
and
i
have
in
mind
how
difficult
it
is
to
erase
from
a
jury's
mind
utterances
but
i
don't
think
that
an
in
temper
utterance
of
a
prosecutor
ought
to
operate
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
successive,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
not
these
utterances,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
--
oh,
yes,
it
was
contended
that
it
shouldn't
have
been
allowed
to
--
to
show
the
--
the
other
deaths
and
it
was
contended
that
it
shouldn't
have
been
allowed
to
show
the
extent
of
the
illicit
relations
with
--
with
the
question
of
evidence
but
not
--
but
not
as
far
as
these
utterances
are
concerned.
mr.
william
c.
wines
not
the
fact
of
his
previous
conviction.
oh,
that's
--
that's
a
point
that
i
--
that
i
would
--
that
i
should
discuss.
now
petitioner
--
petitioner
makes
the
point
that
he
was
prevented
from
trying
--
from
--
from
testifying
on
his
subsequent
trials
because
had
he
testified,
his
original
conviction
would
have
been
admissible
to
impeaching.
that
is
correct,
but
we
say
that
that
is
in
accordance
with
a
very
well-set
of
rules
of
criminal
evidence
everywhere,
that
prior
convictions
are
admissible
to
impeach
when
you
take
the
stand
and
that
no
question
of
due
process
is
raised
by
that.
i'm
--
i
think
mr.
leighton
made
a
slight
mistake
as
to
illinois
law.
he
said
that
the
punishment
for
an
attempt
is
the
same
as
a
punishment
for
the
commission
of
a
crime.
he's
mistaken
about
that
if
he
meant
to
say
it.
have
these
people
not
died,
to
my
understanding
of
the
illinois
law,
and
i'm
quite
sure
i'm
correct
about
it,
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
subject
to
a
prosecution
for
assault
with
intent
to
commit
murder
and
the
maximum
penalty
would
have
been
14
years
which
is
a
minimum
penalty
for
murder.
but
there
is
no
death
penalty
in
illinois
for
an
attempted
murder
that's
not
successful.
i
don't
think
mr.
leighton
meant
to
say
that
there
was.
mr.
william
c.
wines
my
understanding
based
on
my
general
knowledge
of
the
illinois
criminal
law
is
just
exactly
the
same
as
mr.
leighton's,
but
i'm
not
able
to
fortify
it
by
a
citation
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
i'm
not
able
to
support
it
by
--
by
a
citation
of
any
decision
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
can't
think
of
one
by
name
but
i
do
know
that
there
are
occasional
successive
prosecutions
for,
but
i
can't
give
you
the
name
of
one
even
from
--
even
from
the
trial
court.
i
know
it
does
happen.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
don't
say
without
any
--
without
any
deviations
or
variations
but
i
say
that
the
overwhelming
consensus
is
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
have
any
from
the
british
commonwealth.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
in
fact
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
couldn't
say
--
i
couldn't
say
all
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes
--
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
will
not
--
not
really.
there
weren't
--
there
weren't
too
many.
and
i
will
say
this
for
petitioner.
petitioner's
--
petitioner's
brief
itself
collects,
and
we
cite
two.
there
were
a
number
of
cases,
recent
cases,
where
a
single
automobile
accident
has
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
several
people
and
these
several
states
hold
for
it
generally
that
that
subjects
the
driver
to
successive
prosecutions
for
manslaughter.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
they
are
on
mr.
leighton's
brief.
he
is
very
candid
about
citing
them.
he
has
made
a
very
fair
argument
and
a
very
fair
presentation.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
it
shows
that
each
one
was
shot
through
--
was
found
shot
through
the
head
and
overcome
--
yes,
after
--
as
a
result
of
this
fire,
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
that'll
conclude
my
submission.
