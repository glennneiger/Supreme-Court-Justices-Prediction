mr.
wines,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
your
answer
with
justice
douglas.
you
had
made
one
statement.he
asked
you
a
question
that
applied
to
acquittal
and
conviction,
that
you
answered
him
in
a
slightly
different
matter
from
my
standpoint.
your
original
statement
that
least
in
the
english-speaking
world
as
you've
talked
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
insofar
as
convictions
were
concerned
it
had
been
held
that
there
could
be
trials
of
(inaudible)
such
as
we
have
here,
into
different
offenses
by
reason
of
conviction
of
damage
to
different
persons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
based
that
on
history
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
when
you
answered
promptly,
justice
douglas
asked
if
you
are
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
two,
you
went
back
to
--
you
didn't
say
based
on
history.
as
far
as
the
english-speaking
world
is
concerned
that
you
were
talking
about,
as
you've
investigated,
has
there
been
any
difference
drawn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
regard
to
those
two
circuits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
whatever
you
would
say
with
reference
to
the
convictions,
four
convictions,
the
three
convictions
it
apply
alike
so
far
as
history
is
concerned
four
acquittals
or
three
acquittals
are
forth
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
distinction
you
draw
is
not
based
as
i
understand
here
on
different
treatment
in
connection
with
those
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
past.
