l.
black
you
made
one
statement
of
it.
you
said
all
that

he
--
was
after
this
hearing
on

point

in
there
to
have
this
--
by
a
proper
hearing
on
this
question
on
the
voluntariness
in
connection
with
the
sheriff's
statement
that
you
arrest
him
on
the
fact
that
the
court
below,
as
i
gather
that
the
court
looked
at
the
record
and
read
the
evidence
that
it
was
--
it
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
heat
the
witnesses
the
second
or
time
on
this
issue.
justice
hugo
l.

your
case?
justice

l.
black
you,
of
course,
claim
that
the
jury
and
the
court
were
right
in
the
first
place
that
you
say
whether
so
or
not,
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
new
trial
of
that
issue
in
the
district
court,
although
it
was
asked.
