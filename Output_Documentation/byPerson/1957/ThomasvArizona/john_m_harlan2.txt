we
find
the
two
confessions
or
written
confessions
that

printed?
justice

m.
harlan
in
the
typewritten
record.
justice

harlan
is
that
in
the
start
in
record?
justice
john

page
is

on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
your
brief.
justice

where
does
the
costoversion
appear?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
in
the
typewritten
record
or
is
it
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
go
to
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
very
little
of
this
record
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
facilitate
matters,
could
you
leave
with
the
clerk
after
argument,
if
the
chief
justice
approves,
just
the
notations
of
pages
on
the
record
where
this
stuff
is
controverted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
the
--
isn't
the
briefs?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
--
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that.
i
am
simply
a
special
assistant
of
the
attorney
general,
and
we
think
to
argue
this
case,
that
--
that
i
got
into
it
after
the
--
the
record
was
formulated.
but
on
this
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
question,
were
the
unused
confession
--
conceded
confession
for
the
the
district
court,
united
states
disctrict
court
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
printed
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
when
the
state
or
the
magistrate
--
testify
in
the
magistrate,
justice
of
the
peace
was
admitted,
the
first
confession,
there
was
an
objection
made
to
it
by
mr.
morgan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
objection
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
care
about
that
particularly,
which
is
general
as
that,
but
was
there
any
argument
made
by
mr.
morgan
at
the
time
that
statement
was
admitted
that
in
view
of
the
court's
exclusion
of
the
subsequent
confessions
that
was
--
the
ourt
had
no
business
admitting
this
earliest
testimony
of
the
magistrate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
didn't
make
--
he
made
that
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
did
--
what
did
the
court
say
to
him?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
pretty
vital
--
so
far
as
the
record,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
and
i'd
like
to
see
it.
well,
without
taking
up
the
time
of
the
court,
perhaps,
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice,
you'd
release
that
reference
to
the
clerk.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
--
