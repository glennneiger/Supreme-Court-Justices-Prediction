mr.
w.
edward
morgan
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
and
this
case
comes
before
you
arising
originally
in
the
state
of
arizona
in
a
capital
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
punishment
was
set
to
death.
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
the
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction.
the
defendant
subsequently,
filed
an
extraordinary
motion
for
new
trial
which
was
denied
by
the
lower
court,
appealed
to
the
state
supreme
court.
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
the
denial
by
the
superior
court
which
is
our
court
of
first
instance.
and
the
petitioner
herein
then
filed
an
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
with
the
united
states
supreme
court,
which
was
not
granted.
the
petitioner
then
filed
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
phoenix,
arizona.
and
he
filed
that
in
two
forms,
through
his
counsel.
and
was
counsel
here,
today.
the
writ
was
heard
on
by
--
with
argument
and
by
examination
of
a
--
of
the
transcript
of
the
original
trial,
eight
volumes
which
had
been
and
more
forward
into
this
court.
the
applications
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
or
any
one
but
they
were
in
two
forms,
were
denied
by
judge
mccollough.
and
from
that
denial,
the
petitioner
obtained
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
from
the
judge
of
the
district
court
and
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
which
the
--
it
was
a
hearing
and
the
district
court
was
affirmed
and
from
the
affirmation
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
the
district
court's
of
--
denial
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
counsel
filed
a
petition
for
an
application
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
it
--
it
is
that
--
it
was
on
that
base
that
we
have
before
you
today.
the
--
the
fundamental
--
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
--
to
the
application
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
most
fundamental
one,
of
course,
goes
to
the
admission
into
evidence
in
the
original
trial
of
a
confession
of
the
defendant
and
the
petitioner
herein.
the
trial
court
had
before
it
a
number
of
confessions
of
the
petitioner,
arthur
thomas.
most
of
them,
written,
transcribed
by
secretaries
and
read
and
then
signed
by
the
petitioner
--
by
the
defendant,
arthur
thomas.
the
trial
court
heard
the
--
these
confessions
in
an
ancillary
procedure,
that
is
a
procedural
side
of
the
--
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
predicated
upon
the
original
arrest
and
the
method
of
the
arrest
of
the
defendant,
held
the
confessions
to
be
involuntary.
the
circumstances
of
that
arrest
were
in
the
nature
of
a
putative
lynching.
the
testimony
which
was
admitted
by
the
state's
witnesses,
including
the
sheriff,
was
that
the
defendant
was
found
about
30
or
40
miles
north
of
bisbee,
in
a
small
community,
a
cotton
area
which
had
recently
been
put
into
cotton
production
and
he
was
a
cotton
chopper
there
and
this
was
his
occupation.
he
lived
with
a
common-law
wife
in
a
--
in
a
housing
provided
by
the
owners
or
the
managers
of
this
--
of
this
cotton
acreage.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i
don't
know
when
you
were
there,
sir.
its
--
during
the
war
and
just
subsequent
to
the
war,
they
started
mining
water
in
that
area
and
pouring
it
on
the
ground
and
raising
high
grade
cotton.
and
this
area
was
in
--
being
cleared
at
this
time
and
being
put
into
production
for
a
long
staple
egyptian
cotton.
and
the
defendant
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
here
was
a
itinerant
worker.
he
came
from
west
texas
and
was
working
in
the
fields,
at
this
time,
pulling
out
roots.
he
was
discovered,
there's
been
a
--
the
homicide
was
discovered
in
the
morning
and
the
sheriff
went
out
and
they
searched
and
they
found
certain
information
which
indicated
that
the
party
they
were
looking
for
was
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
arthur
thomas.
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
date
of
discovery
of
the
homicide,
they
went
out
with
a
group
of
men
anywhere
from
10
to
11
to
12,
maybe
more,
some
on
horseback,
who
collected
together,
local
ranchers
who
knew
the
deceased
who
was
a
white
woman,
who
ran
a
small
market
where
her
body
was
found.
and
off
in
the
desert,
they
discovered
the
defendant
and
the
sheriff
came
along
and
was
discovered
by
one
of
the
sheriff's
deputies
and
he
was
handcuffed
and
bought
out,
the
other
men
gathered
about
and
the
sheriff
was
there
with
a
representative
with
the
state
highway
patrol,
the
young
man
by
the
name
of
harry
(inaudible)
and
a
sergeant
(inaudible)
from
the
arizona
state
highway
department,
i
believe,
was
there.
and
at
this
point,
after
the
defendant
who
had
not
put
up
any
resistance
and
was
handcuffed
while
he
was
roped
about
the
neck
and
there
is
a
conflict
then
of
testimony
as
to
what
occurred
as
it's
shown
by
the
record.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no,
sir.
no.
it
was
a
rancher
whom
subsequently
in
the
trial,
refused
to
testify
on
the
basis
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
and
claim
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
there
were
other
officers
there.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
the
sheriff
was
there.
the
sheriff
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
took
the
rope
off
the
defendant's
neck
and
said
in
effect
to
the
man
leave
this
--
leave
the
defendant
alone.
the
--
there
was
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
sir.
and
the
defendant
was
on
the
ground
handcuffed
and
the
--
there
was
testimony
by
harry
(inaudible),
the
state
highway
patrolman
which
was
introduced
to
the
effect
that
the
sheriff
said,
“if
you
don't
tell
the
truth,
i'll
let
them
go
ahead
with
this.”
the
sheriff
denied
this
under
oath.
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
took
the
defendant
--
he
took
the
rope
off
the
defendant's
neck
and
immediately
took
him
to
his
car.
there
was
other
testimony
in
the
record
by
other
parties
present
that
they
--
that
the
defendant
was
moved
along
for
a
considerable
space
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
in
the
general
directions
of
a
tree.
this
--
but
the
uncontradicted
portion
of
this
is
that
the
defendant
was
roped
and
roped
around
the
neck.
the
position
of
what
the
sheriff
did
or
didn't
do
is
in
--
is
in
dispute.
the
defendant
at
that
time
indicated
that
a
third
party,
a
young
boy
by
the
name
ross
lee
cooper
was
a
culpable
party
and
that
he
was
the
culpable
party.
and
he
was
asked
where
the
--
where
this
ross
lee
cooper
was
and
he
told
the
sheriff
where
he
was
which
only
about
three
miles
north
in
another
area
where
they
were
clearing
land
and
this
other
party
was
picking
up
routes.
the
unofficial
posse
or
group
of
men,
some
of
them
with
--
the
sheriff
said
that
none
of
them
had
any
guns,
but
others
testified
that
they
had
a
rifle
and
some
of
the
men
were
on
horseback
with
guns
and
some
were
on
foot,
moved
off
by
horse
and
by
foot
and
by
car
north
about
three
miles
to
look
for
the
other
party,
ross
lee
cooper.
the
uncontradicted
testimony
again
is
that
the
ross
lee
cooper
was
roped
and
there
are
some
question,
as
a
argument
as
to
terminology,
as
to
whether
he
was
lead
across
the
open
field
as
one
would
a
well-trained
dog
or
whether
he
was
jerked
across
the
field
in
the
--
towards
where
the
defendant,
thomas,
was
standing
with
the
sheriff.
but
it's
uncontradicted
that
he
was
roped
and
brought
to
where
thomas
was
at
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
within
eyesight
view
of
where
thomas
was
and
then
the
uncontradicted
testimony
is
that
when
thomas
--
when
cooper
came
up
to
where
thomas
was,
both
of
them
were
handcuffed
and
they
were
again
roped.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
varies
from
somewhere
about
10
upwards
or
maybe
15
or
so.
it's
not
a
very
--
the
area
was
going
outside
the
record,
if
the
court
please,
it's
a
--
it's
a
couple
of
houses
in
this
area,
that's
all.
that's
an
inhabitant
area.
it
was
just
being
--
it
was
a
desert
which
was
that
being
broken
into
--
into
cotton
lands.
there
was
a
(inaudible)
there
and
this
little
market
in
which
the
deceased
was
killed.
now,
this
group
were
men,
two
of
them,
we
at
least
know
by
the
record,
were
acquainted
with
the
deceased
who
apparently
was
a
very
respected
white
woman
who
was
running
--
a
widow
woman,
who
was
a
running
a
store
there.
her
body
had
been
viewed
by
some
of
them
including
the
sheriff
and
she
was
--
had
been
burned
and
a
pretty
grizzly
situation.
the
testimony
was,
of
course,
that
everyone
acted
calmly
and
cooly
and
it
was
not
at
least
bit
upset
about
it.
but
the
two
men
were
roped
and
then
there
are
some
contradicts,
some
quibble
of
words
as
whether
they
would
jerked
to
the
ground
or
whether
they
stumbled
over
some
of
the
high
hillocks
to
the
ground.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
they
--
were
to
the
ground
at
least
once
with
a
rope
around
them
and
there
were
some
dispute
as
to
whether
at
each
particular
time
the
rope
was
around
their
necks
or
whether
at
one
time,
it
was
around
part
of
their
neck
and
part
of
their
body
or
whether
it
was
around
their
body.
these
were
all
state
witnesses
as
to
--
as
to
--
and
they
contradicted
themselves
as
to
the
position
of
the
rope.
the
--
then
according
to
the
evidence,
the
--
both
defendants
were
taken
north
to
willcox
to
be
purportedly
brought
before
a
--
a
magistrate
and
the
evidence
within
the
--
that
was
the
sole
evidence
that
they
were
brought
north
to
willcox,
maybe
another
30
or
40
miles
north
to
a
small
community,
willcox,
to
be
brought
before
a
justice
of
peace
by
the
name
of
chastain.
the
--
when
they
got
to
willcox,
the
justice
of
peace
or
the
magistrate,
and
a
committee
of
magistrate
was
unavailable
by
a
reason
that
he
was
out
doing
his
other
job
of
collecting
children
for
the
--
as
a
school
bus
driver.
they
did
not
wait
for
the
--
for
the
justice
chastain
to
come
back
and
to
hold
the
arraignment.
they
took
the
two
defendants
to
the
local
mortuary
where
the
body
of
the
deceased
had
been
removed
earlier
in
the
day
and
they
were
there
introduced
to
the
charred
remains
of
the
body.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
without
willcox,
they
have
taken
the
--
it
was
--
the
mortuary
was
in
the
same
community
in
which
they
purportedly
took
the
defendants
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
on
before
the
magistrate
in
accordance
with
the
arizona
mandate,
arizona
statute
which
is
similar
to
the
one
as
i
heard
yesterday
from
arkansas
that
the
defendant
shall
be,
forthwith
brought
before
a
committee
magistrate,
where
there
has
been
no
warrant
for
arrest,
but
where
there
has
been
an
arrest
on
basis
of
information.
now
--
but
they
didn't
wait
in
--
in
willcox
according
to
the
record
for
the
return
of
the
justice
chastain
after
taking
the
man
to
the
mortuary.
they
took
--
drove
the
men
back
the
70
miles
or
so
to
bisbee
and
they
brought
the
defendants
to
the
house
of
the
county
attorney,
mr.
polley,
who's
here
today.
who
was
at
that
time,
recovering
from
a
severe
injury
and
was
in
a
body
cast
and
was
at
home.
and
the
defendants
were
brought
to
--
to
mr.
polley's
home
and
they're
interrogated
and
it
is
at
that
place
that
the
first
statement
was
taken
from
the
defendant
which
was
not
a
confession
but
is
a
--
exculpatory
statement.
this
as
pointed
out
in
the
appellees
and
the
brief
of
the
respondent's,
this
statement
was
never
introduced
in
evidence,
the
one
that's
in
the
appendix
--
in
the
appendix
of
the
--
of
the
respondent's
brief.
it
was
marked
for
identification,
i
believe.
as
i
point
--
i
believe
it's
pointed
out
in
their
brief.
the
defendant,
arthur
thomas,
the
petitioner
here
was
suffering
from
a
hand
wound
and
had
been
when
he
was
discovered,
he
was
discovered
with
his
hand
cut,
his
thumb,
bottom
of
his
thumb
and
several
fingers
were
cut.
and
after
spending
three
hours
--
now,
let's
see,
is
picked
up
early
in
the
afternoon
and
the
--
about
9
o'clock
or
maybe
10,
he
finally
was
taken
after
three
hours
at
the
county
attorney's
office
in
the
evening,
county
attorney's
house.
he
was
then
taken
to
the
hospital
for
medical
treatment.
after
going
to
the
hospital
in
which
the
testimony
was
--
was
more
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
taken
after
treatment
so
much
as
to
find
out
what
was
wrong
with
him,
so
it
could
be
introduced
in
evidence
subsequently,
at
least
that
was
testimony
of
the
sheriff's
office.
his
hand
was
treated
and
he
was
taken
back
to
the
jail
in
--
in
bisbee.
and
there,
a
--
a
(inaudible)
of
his
clothes
removed
and
the
pair
of
shoes
were
taken
off
him.
and
the
next
morning,
he
was
taken
by
the
--
the
following
morning,
near
noontime,
he
was
taken
down
to
the
--
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
bisbee,
judge
frazier,
at
which
time
he
was
arraigned
in
the
--
in
the
sense
that
he
was
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not,
he
wanted
a
preliminary
hearing
or
not
and
being
charged
with
--
he
was
charged
with
the
--
with
a
homicide
and
asked
whether
or
not
he
wants
a
preliminary
hearing
which
he
had
a
right
under
our
statutes
when
he
was
charged
with
felony.
i
came
to
the
courtroom,
barefooted
according
to
the
testimony
and
judge
frazier
exercised
little
judicial
restraint
and
start
acting
in
our
position
has
then,
as
a
--
as
an
interrogator
and
as
a
part
of
the
prosecutor's
office
rather
than
as
a
judge.
and
the
defendant's
made
statements
there
that
he
didn't
want
to
--
that
in
either
trial
that
he
was
guilty.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
or
at
the
exact
words
are
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i
don't
need
a
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
he
--
he
was
then
interrogated
a
little
bit
further
by
judge
frazier
who
asked
him,
whether
or
not
he
used
an
axe.
the
judge
had
some
interest
in
this
matter.
the
examination
of
judge
frazier
is
--
it
was
interesting
and
that
our
first
examination,
we
couldn't
--
he
answered
that
he
had
not
advised
the
defendant
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
after
a
recess
and
opportunity
to
discuss
the
matter
with
counsel
for
the
state,
who
came
on
the
stand
and
--
by
the
way,
advised
us
that
he
had
testified
that
he
had
told
the
defendant
that
--
to
have
a
lawyer
and
that
he
needn't
testify
if
he
didn't
feel
like
it.
it
is
to
that
--
that
was
the
only
--
that
was
the
only
confession
which
was
admitted
into
evidence.
now,
there
was
a
confession.
the
defendant
walked
out
of
judge
frazier's
courtroom
and
this
is
a
converted
store.
and
walked
out
of
there
with

the
house
of
the
county
attorney
again,
mr.
polley.
and
there
gave
another
statement
which
was
reduced
the
right
and
that
statement
was
held
involuntary
by
the
trial
court
and
not
admitted
into
evidence
for
the
reason
of
the
continuing
fear,
which
the
court
felt
arose
from
the
original
punitive
lynching.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
the
one
--
the
statement
before
judge
frazier
was

mr.

the
crime
and
to
discover
whether
and
if

for
bond

and
to
determine

or
not
he
desired
a
preliminary

mr.

they
were
all
excluded.
mr.

mr.

just
an
oral

an
oral
statement.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.

edward

say
somewhere
2
--
3
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
preceding
day
to
noon
of
the
following
day.
mr.
w.
edward

it
was
--
mr.
w.
edward

there
was
no
mob
--
there
was
no
mob
after
the
time
of
the
arrest
out
in
the
--
out
in
the
farm
area.
there
was
no
mob.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
two
or
three,
somewhere
in
that
out
--
in
time
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
he
was
taken
by
car
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
oh,
willcox
--
when
he
was
taken
north
and
then
he
was
brought
south
again,
all
30
miles
or
so.
mr.
w.
edward

in
the
county
jail
in
bisbee.
mr.
w.
edward

yes.
mr.
w.
edward

no.
mr.
w.
edward

no.
mr.
w.
edward

yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
edward

no.
mr.
w.
edward

no.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
was
a
--
not
in
the
same
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no.
he
walked
in
accompanied
by
the
sheriff.
therefore,
they
just
in
with
the
sheriff
and
one
other
deputy
--
mr.
w.
edward

no,
none,
whatsoever.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
didn't
have
any
--
i
don't
want
to
tackle
with
words.
didn't
have
any
immediate
pressure,
if
there
was
any
pressure,
it
was
the
remembrance
of
what
had
occurred
out
in
the
--
in
the
field.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
in
fact,
there
was
no
present
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
that's
right,
but
there
was
no
immediate
pressure,
in
all
honesty
if
your
answer.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i
have
no
idea
from
the
record
itself,
no.
the
defendant
was
acquainted
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
i
was
(inaudible)
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
none,
none
whatsoever.
no.
the
trial
court
followed
the
thinking
of
the
--
of
the
counsel,
myself,
it
was
counsel
in
the
--
in
the
original
trial
that
have
been
counsel
all
the
way
through.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
about
--
about
two
days
later.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
already
waives
his
preliminary
so
the
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no
mob.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no
mob.
the
--
the
record
does
not
show
but
i
--
i
went
down
to
make
an
investigation
[laughs]
and
if
may
go
off
the
record,
there
was
no
mob.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
no.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
that's
--
it
was
hard
for
me
to
answer.
i
would
think,
yes,
but
that
would
depend
on
how
you
approached
it
in
--
your
honor
thinking
and
in
terms
of
--
of
a
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no
--
no.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
they
are
not
printed
in
your
transcript.
they
are
in
--
you
have
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
there
is
in
there.
it
should
be
the
guide,
all
the
confessions.
if
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
judge
frazier,
i
think,
testified
as
to
his
demeanor.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no.
they
don't
protest.
the
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
--
i
think
an
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
yesterday
regarding
the
attitude
of
the
counsel
--
the
publicity
regarding
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
in
this
case.i
think
it
might
be
pertinent
to
remark
that
counsel
at
the
time,
felt
it
was
so
flamboyant
and
tending
to
bring
the
defendants
into
hate
in
this
community
that
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
was
--
was
brought
by
counsel
at
the
time
the
trial
was
denied.
the
--
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
also
in
addition
to
the
confessions
that
the
arrest
took
place
on
march
17th
and
the
last
confession
obtained
from
the
defendant
was
on
april
1st,
which
was
in
the
--
while
the
defendant
was
still
in
the
cochise
county
jail
at
bisbee,
and
that
this
confession
was
also
ruled
by
the
trial
judge
as
being
inadmissible
--
as
being
involuntary
by
reason
of
the
original
incidents
of
his
arrest
and
this
was
a
considerable
time.
in
a
connection
with
the
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
the
--
the
roping
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
--
if
the
court
please.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
his
distinction
set
forth
in
his
--
we
ask
the
trial
judge
that
a
direct
question,
we
ask
him
why
he
did
this.
he
said
i
--
if
counsel
wants
to
know
the
answer,
the
answer
is
that
i
feel
that
he
was
in
the
--
he
was
in
the
courtroom
and
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
--
of
the
man
who
had
saved
him,
that
is
the
sheriff
jack
howard
who
had
saved
him
from
this
--
from
the
posse.
there
is,
i
think,
maybe
a
more
fundamental
reason
and
that
is
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
have
the
testimony
of
the
state
highway
patrolman
harry
selchow
at
the
time
he
made
his
ruling
on
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
ancillary
hearing.
the
--
that
testimony
of
the
state
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
outside
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
--
of
the
--
of
the
jury.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
it
was.
and
at
that
time,
for
the
first
time,
who
was
given
the
testimony
of
the
state
highway
patrolman
harry
selchow.
we
had
released
the
witness
harry
selchow
to
give
testimony
in
a
murder
case
in
tucson
in
the
federal
court
upon
three
hours
notice
to
return.
and
in
the
proceedings
aside
from
the
jury,
we
came
to
a
point
very
rapidly,
very
unexpectedly,
the
judge
ruled
on
the
confessions
and
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
bring
back
sergeant
selchow
nor
did
we
know
what
his
testimony
was
going
to
be.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
oh,
about
two
or
three
days.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
two
days,
at
least,
before
we
got
to
the
point
of
our
putting
on
our
case.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
but
we
didn't
know
what
he
was
testifying.
we
took
a
chance
when
we
put
him
on
the
stand.we
did
not
know
what
he
would
testify
to.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
the
matter
was
already
before
the
jury.[laughs]
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
the
jury
had
heard
what
had
happened.
the
court
had
admitted
the
confession
to
the
jury.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
we
ask
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
it
could
have
i
think
he
was
in
error
or
not.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
we
--
we
made
a
motion
for
mistrial.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
and
we,
of
course,
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trail
after
it
even
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
the
officer
testified
that
the
sheriff
--
that
the
sheriff
stated
to
--
that
the
sheriff
said
to
the
defendant,
arthur
thomas,
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
while
a
rope
was
around
his
neck,
yet
the
exact
words
(inaudible)
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
it's
in
your
printed
record.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
according
to
the
sheriff
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
--
said
the
sheriff
quotes
who
claim
to
have
saved
the
defendant.
his
words
were
to
the
affect
of,
“if
you
don't
tell
the
truth,
i
will
let
them
go
ahead.
i
will
let
them
go
ahead
with
this
thing."
the
sheriff's
words,
"sheriff,
according
to
officer
selchow
who
testified
before
the
jury
and
his
words
were
the
--
at
the
time
that
the
--
arthur
thomas
was
first
arrested,
his
words
were
to
the
effect,
“if
you
don't
tell
the
--
if
you
don't
go
ahead
and
tell
them,
i
will
let
them
go
ahead
with
this.”
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
pardon
me.
if
i
can
--
and
i
admit
he
was
--
excuse
me.
you
see
it's
--
it's
in
here
appended
to
my
brief,
i
think
maybe
appended
to
my
brief.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
at
least
two.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
well,
one
in
the
two
that
were
excluded,
the
arrest
was
on
the
17th
in
the
afternoon.
the
first
confession
which
was
excluded
was
taken
in
the
following
afternoon
on
the
--
around
1
o'clock
of
the
following
afternoon
at
the
county
attorney's
home,
that
was
about
20
minutes
after
the
oral
statement.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
he
talked
to
the
local
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
in
the
morning
around
12
o'clock.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
within
about
20
minutes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
that
was
excluded.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
on
april
1st,
approximately
april
1st
was
a
--
there
was
a
confession
which
had
been
previously
transcribed
and
was
--
to
which
was
taken
up
to
the
defendant
when
he
was
in
jail
by
mr.
percy
boudin.
and
he
was
asked
to
read
it
and
initial
it,
and
this
was
after
counsel
had
been
appointed
in
the
case.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
this
is
march.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
march,
sir.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
march.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
15
days
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
--
two
weeks,
15
days.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
there
are
--
there
are
two
things
further
on
that,
of
course,
the
--
there
is
testimony
and
there
were
pictures
introduced
showing
the
--
the
rope
burns
on
both
the
necks
of
the
other
party,
rose
lee
cooper,
the
other
boy
who
was
roped.
and
there
were
pictures
introduced
of
the
rope
burns
on
the
neck
of
defendant,
arthur
thomas,
showing
the
large
welts
from
where
the
rope
which
according
to
some
of
the
sheriff's
officers
had
been
around
their
neck,
left
the
mark
around
his
neck.
in
addition,
a
--
there
was
testimony
that
is
late
as
four
days
after
the
time
of
his
arrest
and
certainly
after
the
time
of
his
appearance
in
the
justice
court,
he
was
still
suffering
pain
from
the
cuts
and
wounds
in
his
hands,
in
his
hand.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
very
definitely.
it
was
evidence
of
his
guilts
in
the
case.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
because
of
the
fact
that
a
--
the
way
that
the
hand
was
cut
mimicked
the
cuts
that
were
found
in
a
bloody
glove
which
was
found
on
the
premises
of
the
defendant.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
that
is
the
pertinent
testimony.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
that's
right,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i
presume
he
came
back
the
next
day,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
and
we
didn't
recognize
that
--
we
couldn't
make
an
offer
of
proof
because
of
we
--
as
we
laid
before
a
federal
district
court
and
as
we
have
laid
before
this
court.
officer
selchow
refused
upon
two
occasions,
upon
my
original
investigation
in
the
case
and
subsequently,
he
refused
at
the
time
of
our
release
of
him.
as
a
witness,
he
was
called
--
he
was
put
on
the
information
as
a
state's
witness.
and
we
discussed
it
with
him
at
that
time
and
then
he
refused
to
tell
us
what
his
testimony
would
be.
said,
“i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
what
i
will
testify
to.”
and
when
we
called
officer
selchow
as
a
rebuttal
witness,
we
did
it
as
an
act
of
desperation
and
as
a
guess
--
as
to
what
he
would
testify.
we
did
not
know
what
his
testimony
was
going
to
be.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
(voice

it's
not
in
the
record,
it
is
not
in
the
record.
it
is
not
in
the
record
at
any
place
that
i
know
of.
the
--
it
was
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
no,
it
was
not,
we
did
not
bring
it
out
either
in
the
state
courts
because,
be
off
the
record,
if
i
--
if
i
say
why
[laughs]
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
we
did
not
do
it.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i've
used
my
time
up
--
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
i
had
the
red
light.
mr.
w.
edward

well
i
have
--
i
was
assigned
in
the
state

but
not
in
any
of
the
fields
of
the
federal
court.
mr.

edward

yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
edward
morgan
mr.
chief
justice.
i
like
to
point
out
to
you
the
record
and
give
you
the
notation
of
it
in
the
state
transcript
at
page
2137
about
the
--
the
very
important
witness,
mr.
byrd
who
was
unconcerned
with
the
case
and
therefore,
was
the
only
person
who
gave
accurate
testimony
as
to
what
happened
at
the
roping.
and
particularly
with
reference
to
the
purported
statement
of
the
sheriff,
mr.
jack
howard,
at

of
the
state

he
continues
to
say

on

mr.

this
is
the
witness,
mr.
byrd.
who

(inaudible)
byrd
who
was
referred
to
by

mr.

yes,
this
