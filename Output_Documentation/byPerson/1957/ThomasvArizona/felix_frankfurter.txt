may

stop

justice

--
you
long
enough
to

have
you
elucidate
this
last
statement,
were
those

you
said
they
were
excluded
because
of
the
incidents
connected
with
the
time
of
his

justice

i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
felix

well
--
justice

frankfurter
--
if
later
confessions
--
these
were
later,
were
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
later
confessions
were
excluded
by
the
trial
court
because
of
the
continuing,
disturbing,
undermining
influence
of
the
incident
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
how
did
he
differentiate
admitting
to
the
judge
orally,
which
was
earlier
in
time
than
the
confessions
which
he
excluded?
justice

ancillary
hearing
was

--
justice

--
in
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
wasn't
the
matter
again
put
before
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
time
elapsed
between
the
ruling
of
the
court
in
chambers
and
the
submission
of
the
evidence
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
this
--
was
this
witness
then
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
after
he
testified,
the
matter
was
then
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
my
--
my
inquiry
is
why,
if
you
deemed
that
so
relevant,
it
wouldn't
have
changed
the
court's
judgment
on
the
validity
of
the
admission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
all
of
weaknesses
of
telling
a
jury
not
to
tend
what
they
heard,
at
least,
he
could've
made
that
correction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
morgan,
this
--
this
matter,
it
seems
to
me
--
to
me,
at
least,
so
crucial
that
i'd
like
to
ask,
if
i
may,
one
or
two
questions
so
that
when
the
attorney
general
put
the
state's
case,
you
will
be
able
to
deal
with
it.
you
will
deal
with
it.
let's
see
if
i
understand
this.
there
was
an
oral
disclosure
by
thomas
in
this
--
in
this
informal
courthouse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
he
there
said
was
admitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
admission
was
first
in
chambers
before
the
judge
and
the
preliminary
i
think,
and
then
the
matter
was
right
before
the
jury
and
left
for
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
subsequently
two
so-called
confessions,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
of
which
were
excluded
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
ground,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
--
that
the
subverting,
the
coercing
effect
of
his
experience
at
the
time
of
arrest
continued
and
operated
to
make
what
his
--
that
make
his
confession
involuntary,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
now,
if
you'll
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
how
much
time
elapsed
between
the
arrest,
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
the
two
confessions
that
were
excluded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
meantime,
you
talked
to
the
local
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
morning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
he
went
to
the
--
to
the
prosecutor
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
that
was
excluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
was
the
second?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
april
was
--
when
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
18
to
what
month,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon.
march?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
this
was
nearly
two
weeks
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
15
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
one
final
question,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
was
explicit
in
excluding
the
march
18
and
the
april
1st
confession
on
the
ground
that
the
--
that
the
--
what
shall
i
call
it,
the
destructive
influence
of
the
circumstances
of
his
arrest
continued
their
invalidating
cause
of
those
two
dates,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
the
attorney
general
will
deal
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
his
statement
--
purported
statement
of
the
sheriff
is
controverted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
the
printed
record
was
that
by
agreement
of
the
two
sides
or
that
you
determined
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
we
--
could
we
--
in
the
interest
of
the
entire
(inaudible)
knowing
that
mr.
morgan
has
been
retained
after
the
case
got
into
the
federal
courts,
or
did
he
just
carried
on
the
litigation
now,
out
of
interest,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
what
i'm
looking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
the,
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
this
question
when
you
say,
this
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please
identify
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
general
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
you
made
an
offer
of
proof.
you
said,
your
honor
we're
indicated
--
you're
going
to
introduce
the
confession.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
and
then
the
other
side
did
something
or
didn't
something
and
the
court
of
its
own
motion
says,
“he
better
adjourn
to
my
chambers.
we
will
see
with
its
vountariness.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
it
--
was
that
a
reply
to
a
question
for
mr.
morgan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
he
come
to
deny,
if
there
is
no
evidence
as
yet
that
he
had
said
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
specific
--
was
there
an
instructional
with
reference
to
this
specific
issue
of
the
conflict
regarding
the
exact
--
for
the
substantial
offerings
of
the
sheriff?
or
--
or
was
the
general
question
that
the
jury
must
determine
whether
the
thing
is
voluntary
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
--
but
could
it
put
that
issue.
he
couldn't
comment
on
it.
but
could
it
put
that
issue
that
it's
for
you
to
decide
who
is
telling
--
who
is
accurate
or
truthful
whatever
the
phrase
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
in
for
these
general
--
general
charges
to
jury,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
meant
by
general,
namely,
it
wasn't
directed
during
this
specific
item
of
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
you
rather
indicated
that
that
might
--
that
all
events
is
not
the
practice.
it
might
be
very
dubious
as
to
propriety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
answer
to
a
question
by
my
brother,
douglas,
you
indicated
--
you
did
not
know
whether
that
or
i
think
you
said
that
the
particular
issue
as
to
the
right
--
as
to
what
it
is
the
sheriff
really
said,
was
not
put
to
the
federal
court
for
its
determination.
is
that
the
specific
question?
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
didn't
know
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
federal
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
specifically
or
as
part
of
the
general
request
that
there
be
a
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
included
in
the
request
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
that
there'd
be
a
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
that
wasn't
singled,
forgive
me.
that
wasn't
singledout
as
something
on
which
the
petitioner,
nor
if
he
had
a
right,
he'd
have
a
hearing
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
understood
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
right
there,
when
you
say
that
they
did
not
hear,
thing
that
sometimes
said
that
people
in
the
immediate
relation
to
the
utterance
may
not
have
heard
it.
that
merely
means
the
fellow
says,
“i
didn't
hear
it”.
and
he
didn't
hear
it,
non
constat.
it
wasn't
said.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
there
anything
--
the
reason
--
is
there
anything
in
the
evidence
that
indicates
a
better
advantage
of
the
--
of
the
--
this
patrolman?
what
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
highway
patrolman
was
better
placed
to
hear
everything
the
sheriff
said
than
the
other
witnesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
sheriff
--
the
sheriff,
himself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
denied
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there
was
--
there
was
a
group
around
of
--
how
many
--
how
many
county
officials
did
you
put
on,
six,
five?
justice
felix
frankfurter
six
and
they
were
all
in
the
vicinity
of
the
sheriff.
and
they
were
all
more
or
less,
equally
well
placed
to
hear
what
was
said
if
it
was
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
why
--
that's
why
a
conflict
of
having
testified
to
something
being
said
or
not
said,
may
not
involve
perjury
or
conscious
concealment,
may
involve
hearing,
may
involve
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
thomas,
himself,
the
witness
in
chambers
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
investigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
what
we
have
is
by
designation
and
cross-designation
of
counsel.
what
--
the
record
we
have
is
as
before
by
agreement
of
counsel.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
that
isn't
the
information
i
asked
(inaudible).
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
this
laying
the
foundation
was
all
a
single
proceeding
as
you
indicated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
--
i
feel
this
way
about
it,
that
i
followed
you
up
at
the
time
that
you
read
this,
namely
that
there
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
an
unrelated
issue
which
you
resisted
and
the
court
decided
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
motion
by
mr.
morgan
for
mistrial
on
an
unrelated
issue,
another
issue
unrelated
to
our
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then,
you
now
read
--
the
court
went
on
his
--
on
the
court
voluntarily
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
feel
this
way
about,
it
--
was
there
no
antecedent
to
this,
it.
what
is
the
"it"
refer
to?
i
feel
this
way
about
"it"?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question
whether
there
was
a
finding
of
facts
by
the
trial
court
that
these
confessions
were
involuntary
and
therefore
to
be
excluded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
reading
what
he
does
say
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
reason
--
the
reason
that
it's
important
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
are
--
we
are
bound
by
--
we
certainly
would
be
bound
by
a
finding
of
the
trial
court
and
we
couldn't
here
say
it
included
that
he
was
wrong
and
not
admitting
this
and
therefore
he
was
right
in
defeating
what
he
did
admit,
could
we?
he
couldn't
here
say,
he
was
wrong
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
we
can't
say
will
--
what's
suppose
(inaudible)
who
would
have
been
bound
by
the
finding
of
fact
of
a
trial
court.
if
a
finding
of
fact
is
at
its
--
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
we
can't
say
here
that
was
an
improper
ruling,
can
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
said
the
--
we
might
find
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
disregarding
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
we
could
hardly
say
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
dealing
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
applied
for
within
the
90
days
from
the
final
disposition
in
your
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
from
the
different
ground,
but
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
aim
the
same
thing
namely
to
set
aside
that
judgment
as
invalidly
secure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
required
that
the
--
that
the
judgment,
the
sentence
of
death
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
nullified
and
that
he
have
a
new
trial,
all-in-one
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
take
part
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
motion
for
new
trial,
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
this
new
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
is
that?
that
was
a
proceeding
that
was
still
going
on
under
the
remedies
available
under
your
state
law
and
therefore,
i
should
think
mr.
morgan
that
he
was
in
the
case
as
well
advised
not
to
file
the
petition
for
certiorari
here
until
that
supplementary
proceeding
in
your
state
court
was
--
was
completed.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
therefore,
my
question
to
you,
if
the
petition
which
this
court
or
if
the
petition
which
was
filed
on
october
24th,
1955
was
within
the
90
days
of
the
final
disposition
of
everything
that
was
open
under
arizona
procedure,
he
is
quite
within
our
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
having
been
denied,
he
then
was
entitled
to
bring
his
petition
for
his
application
for
habeas
corpus
and
indeed,
he
couldn't
have
brought
it
before,
could
he?
he
had
to
come
here
under
darr
and
burford.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
should
think
it
was
all
according
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
all
terms
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
all
terms
whether
he
came
here
within
90
days
of
the
last
stage
of
arizona
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
pidgeon,
if
--
if
mr.
morgan
had
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
after
the
disposition
of
the
main
trial
in
your
supreme
court
and
there
has
been
pending
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
under
arizona
law,
i
should
think
you
would've
said
to
this
court,
"those
--
this
is
a
premature
petition
for
certiorari
because
non-concept,
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
that
you
might
be
granted
in
this
arizona
court?”
and
therefore,
the
questions
on
which
you're
asked
this
rather
petition,
would
become
nonexistent,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
possible
because
this
court
certainly
wouldn't
grant
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
a
capital
case
when
there
is
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
before
the
--
some
lower
court
in
arizona,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
that
very
case
and
i
shouldn't
think
we
wouldn't
speculate
whether
we
knew
it
or
not,
i
assume
counsel's
duty
would
be
to
tell
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
secret
among
lawyers
who
filed
motions
or
prosecutors
against
whom
it
is
filed,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
the
whole
procedure
which
is
opened
by
a
state
law
is
completed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
all
depends
on
state
procedure
for
the
state
allows
such
a
motion
forever.
and
the
case
isn't
closed,
but
there
is,
in
fact,
an
exercise
of
that
power
to
file
a
motion
for
new
trial.
there's
no
case
for
this
court,
non-concept,
the
state
wouldn't
take
care
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
morgan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assuming
that
on
--
of
course,
in
every
respect
of
--
of
intention
to
be
accurate
to
counsel
in
this
case,
would
you
say
that
one
could
really
form
a
fair
estimate
of
what
took
place
without
reading
at
least
that
part
of
the
record?
