mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
make
two
points.
one
is
when
we
talk
about
habeas
corpus
itself.
and
in
this
particular
case,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
judge,
the
united
states
federal
judge,
was
correct
in
denying
this
application
for
habeas
corpus
on
the
grounds
that
the
remedies
had
not
been
exhausted.
now,
if
i
understand
correctly,
rule
22
(1)
of
this
court
provides
that
you
have
90
days
from
the
final
hearing
in
the
state
supreme
court
within
which
to
file
certiorari
appear.
in
this
particular
case,
the
appeal
was
decided
in
arizona
on
october
18,
1954.
a
rehearing
was
denied
on
november
16th,
1954.
it
is
the
state's
contention
that
the
90
days
commenced
to
run
when
that
rehearing
was
denied.
however,
it
wasn't
until
october
24th,
1955,
about
11
months
later
that
certiorari
was
applied
for
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
in
the
meantime,
it
is
true
there
had
been
an
application
for
a
new
trial
in
the
trial
court
on
the
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence
that
no
point
that
was
brought
up
in
the
trial
was
brought
up
in
that
particular
application
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
but
it
wasn't
until
after
that
matter
had
been
applied
for
in
the
superior
court
and
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
a
rehearing
denied
that
certiorari
was
for
the
first
time
applied
for
here.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
it
was
in
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
within
90
days
after
the
denial
of
this
motion
for
a
new
trial.
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
but
that
was
on
an
entirely
different
ground,
on
entirely
new
points
than
where
decided
in
the
first
arizona
supreme
court
decision.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
it's
the
same
case.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
no.
it
was
to
have
a
new
trial
on
two
grounds.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
they
had
some
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
well,
it's
my
understanding
from
brown
versus
allen
and
darr
versus
burford
that
in
order
to
apply
for
habeas
corpus
that
you
must
exhaust
your
state
remedies.
now,
in
order
to
exhaust
your
state
remedies,
you
must
use
them.
in
order
to
use
them,
you
must
make
a
timely
application
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
trial?
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
you
have
--
it
might
be
very
true,
but
that's
not
my
position.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
well
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes,
he
did.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
but
he
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
if
that
is
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes,
your
honor,
at
90
days.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes,
your
honor.
he
can
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence
tomorrow,
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
that's
possibly
true,
but
if
we
follow
that
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
if
we
do
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
no,
it's
no
secret,
pardon
me?
well
then
the
rule
requiring
that
90-day
--
to
file
your
petition
for
certiorari
within
90
days
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
and
--
and
that
can
be
done
at
anytime.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
that
can
be
done
at
anytime,
as
he
files
his
new
motions
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
well,
the
court
understands
my
position
and
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
--
right
or
wrong.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
the
second
matter
--
the
court
will
bare
with
me
for
just
a
few
moments
--
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
--
is
the
fact
that
the
other
evidence
outside
of
this
particular
oral
confession
to
the
court
does
show
is
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
to
show
that
this
man
was
guilty
of
the
crime
of
which
he
was
charged.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
yes,
if
this
court
says
from
a
matter
of
the
uncontradicted
evidence
that's
involuntary,
that
is
true.
but
if,
as
in
the
stein
case,
where
it
is
questionable,
and
i
certainly
think
that
that
is,
at
least,
the
case
here
that
it
is
questionable
whether
this
was
involuntary
or
not,
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
otherwise,
then
the
decision
should
stand
if
it's
submitted
in
--
in
the
right
way.
now,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
in
this
particular
case,
the
confession
which
was
admitted
to
the
jury
was
voluntary
and
there's
no
question
of
that.
now,
mr.
polley
has
argued
that,
but
in
the
event
that
it
is
questionable,
then
i
believe
that
the
rule
of
the
stein
case
applies
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
a
proper
instruction
and
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
with
which
to
convict
and
therefore,
they're
not
entitled
to
their
habeas
corpus.
but
rather
than
take
up
the
court's
time,
those
facts
do
appear
in
the
brief,
the
other
facts.
mr.
john
g.
pidgeon
thank
you
for
the
additional
time.
