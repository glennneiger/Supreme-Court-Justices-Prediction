he
knelt
down
beside
mr.

he
talked
to
him
and
asked
him
why
he
had
killed
the
woman.
he
said,
“no
i
didn't,
the
other
boy
did.”
mr.
howard
said,
“we
have
your
blood
from

we
have
your
shoes

we
have
tracked
you

mr.

you

and
mr.

up
and
i
put
the
handcuffs
on
him.”

“and
then
what
happened,

anything?
somewhere
from

me
a
rope
was
thrown
over
mr.

neck
and
he
was
pulled
back
into
me
and
we
stumbled
a
little
bit
and
i
had
to
hold
of
the
rope
and
then
--
then
mr.
howard
came
around
me
and
i
said,
“jack
this
is
no
way
to
handle
this.”
mr.
howard
went
on
to
the
rope
and
took
hold
of
it,
at
that
point
he
says,
“will
you
tell
the
truth
or
i
will
let
them
go
ahead
and
do
this
or
i'll
go
ahead
and
let
them
use
this?”

and
that
was
the
sheriff
that
he
was
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
was
a
highway
patrolman.
he
was
a
highway
patrolman,
the
man
who
gave
a
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
that
witness
you
say,
you
were
deprived
of
--
of
using
at
the
side
hearing
before
the
--
before
the
court
because
he
was
excused
to
--
to
be
a
witness
at
--
at
another
case
in
the
federal
court
with
instructions
to

chief

on
your

for
a

or

that
brought
out?
chief
justice
earl

well,
you
didn't.
that's
(inaudible)
chief

all
right,
you
may

mr.
polley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
convicted
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
is
mr.
morgan
the
assigned
counsel,
was
he
assigned
by
the
court
to
represent
him,
you
represent
him
all
the
way
through
as
assigned
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
was
the
answer,
mr.
morgan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
by
reason
as
assignment,
you
carried
it
all
the
way
through,
is
that
what
i
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
polley,
may
i
ask
another
and
just
to
get
oriented.
i'd
like
to
get
the
order
of
this
proof
about
what
happened
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
now,
i
like
to
know
how
this
testimony
was
controverted.
did
the
--
did
the
witnesses
for
the
state
just
testify
what
happened
and
then
--
and
then
this
officer
for
--
of
the
highway
patrol
came
along
and
testified
to
something
that
no
one
had
ever
testified
about
before
without
any
rebuttal
to
that?
did
they
leave
the
stand
or
did
--
did
the
sheriff
thereafter,
take
the
stand
and
say
that,
“i
did
not,
i
did
not
say
to
this
man,
"will
you
tell
the
truth
or
i
will
let
them
go
ahead
and
do
this?”
or
did
he
just
let
his
testimony
stand
as
to
what
he
generally
did
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
left
one
off.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
highway
patrolman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
you
didn't
put
them
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
of
the
county
officers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
anticipated
that
this
officer
was
going
to
testify
the
way
he
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
know
that
at
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
testimony
all
came
though
before
the
highway
patrolman
testified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
all
i
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
--
was
that
testimony
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
gave
--
who
gave
that
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
somebody
must
hid
something,
if
the
--
whether
it
was
the
highway
patrolman
or
the
sheriff,
if
one
said,
“if
you
don't
talk,
i'm
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
let
him
do
this
to
you.”
and
the
other
said
that
nothing
of
that
kind
who
said
somebody
was
--
was
concealing
something
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
it
is,
i
don't
--
i
don't
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
petitioner
ask
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
as
it
taken
off
of
him
when
--
when
it
was
thrown
around
him
or
after
he
gotten
into
his
car?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
part
of
--
that
these
cop
ranchers
were
not
a
part
of
the
sheriff's
posse.
how
does
it
happen
--
how
does
it
happen
that
they
were
there
at
the
time
they
arrested
the
second
man
three
miles
away
if
they
weren't
in
the
official
party?
you
said
only
this
man
and
the
sheriff
went
there
to
the
place
where
the
second
boy
was
apprehended.
how
does
it
come
that
the
two
were
there
if
he
wasn't
there
with
the
sheriff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
instance
of
the
sheriff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
--
isn't
that
in
the
defendant's
records?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
this
wasn't
in
the
trial
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
wasn't
used
in
the
trial
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
you
did
attach
that
to
--
to
the
record
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
federal
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
those
were
both
offered
in
evidence,
were
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
contest
--
you
contest
the
finding
on
the
court
that
these
were
involuntary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
the
motion
would
came
as
a
result
of
the
testimony
that
i
would
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
reading
to
us
what
the
trial
court
said
at
the
time
that
excluded
this
confession
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
go
ahead.
let's
hear
the
rest
of
it.
let's
see
what
he
says.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
--
are
you
going
right
on
from
where
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
were?
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
this
was
--
this
was
before
the
hearing
that
he
held
and
it's
chambers
on
the
admissibility
of
this
--
of
these
confessions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
did
you
go
on
and
complete
them
after
this
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
just
said
a
little
while
ago
to
us
that
the
--
in
that
--
in
that
hearing,
it
was
denied
that
there
was
any
such
thing
happened
as
the
highway
patrolman
stated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
was
evidence
in
there,
wasn't
there
that
--
that
a
rope
has
been
thrown
over
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
pretty
good
evidence
isn't
it,
if
a
man's
got
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
someone's
pulling
at
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
polley
--
oh,
pardon
me.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
then
you
accepted
a
finding
of
the
court
that
--
that
the
--
the
confession
against
the
defendant
is
admissible.
you
--
you
say
that
that's
all
right,
but
you
contest
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
the
others
are
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let
me
ask
--
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
there
was
or
if
we
should
conclude
that
there
is
a
finding
by
the
court
in
the
record
that
those
subsequent
confessions
were
involuntary
by
reason
of
the
so-called
lynching
effort
that
was
made
at
the
time
he
was
arrested.
if
we
conceive
that
there
was
a
finding
of
that
kind
by
the
--
by
the
court,
do
you
believe
that
we
can
sustain
the
admitting
of
a
confession
that
was
given
between
the
time
of
the
so-called
lynching
episode
and
the
time
of
the
confessions
that
were
excluded?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
would
you
mind
elaborating
on
that.
tell
us
what
your
reasoning
is
on
that
score.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
challenge
as
to
the
conditions
under
which
you
personally
took
the
statements
from
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
why
do
you
say
that
the
judge
probably
based
it
upon
that
when
there
was
no
evidence
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
there
that
we
should
say
that
--
that
the
judge
acted
prematurely
and
without
--
without
consideration
for
the
facts,
words
against
you,
but
on
the
other
hand
that
he
acted
properly
when
he
acted
for
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
leyra
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
my
point
was
on
the
merits
of
the
case
of
the
extent
of
the
--
of
the
coercion
used,
put
on
the
question
of
subsequent
--
subsequent
confessions
that
one
was
--
if
one
was
bad,
those
that
followed
it
were
bad.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
trial
court
didn't
think
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
that?
will
you
do
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
polley,
but
i
see
mr.
pidgeon
has
been
sitting
there
anxious
to
--
to
say
something
in
this
--
in
this
matter.
you
mentioned
that
he
did.
could
you
in
two
or
three
minutes
make
your
point
mr.
--
mr.
pidgeon?
we'll
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
if
you
--
you
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
we
do,
mr.
pidgeon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
pidgeon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.

you
have
some
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
says?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
merchant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
would
--
would
you
go
--
start
again
and
tell
us
what
you're
just
telling
us,
about
you
wanted
the
whole
transcript.
chief

there.
