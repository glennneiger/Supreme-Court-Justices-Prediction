mr.
wesley
e.
polley
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
say
on
behalf
on
the
state
of
arizona
that
the
state
is
just
as
interested
as
is
this
court
in
seeing
that
its
criminal
processes
and
procedures
aren't
designed
in
such
a
way
as
to
deny
due
process
nor
administered
is
such
as
a
way
as
to
deny
due
process
to
any
person
no
matter
who
that
person
maybe.
now,
this
case
depends
to
a
great
extent,
upon
facts
and
facts
alone.
it
is
here
on
habeas
corpus.
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
why
we
believe
that
petitioner
wasn't
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
district
court.
we
will
not
go
into
that
on
this
argument.
we
further
believe
under
the
rules
of
this
court
that
the
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
there
was
a
petition
filed
in
the
state
of
arizona.
it
was
invited
to
file
opposition
to
that
petition.
there
was
no
testimony
taken.
it
was
simply
--
we
might
say
battle
of
affidavits.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
transcript
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
--
the
state
filed
a
response
and
attached
to
that
response
was
an
affidavit
of
the
county
attorney.
the
admission
against
interest
which
was
taken
by
the
county
attorney,
all
of
the
transcripts
of
the
testimony
and
of
the
lower
court
that
is
the
superior
court,
all
--
all
of
the
briefs
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
on
both
sides.
now,
under
the
rulings
of
this
court,
i
believe
that
the
court
will
examine
the
evidence
in
this
light.
it
will
not
review
disputed
questions
of
fact
and
substitute
its
own
decision
thereon
for
that
of
the
state
jury
and
the
state
courts.
(2)
this
court
will
review
the
undisputed
questions
of
--
the
undisputed
facts
and
will
apply
its
own
independent
legal
judgment
to
those
facts
and
the
law
as
which
defines
due
process.
now,
on
that
basis
i
will
attempt
to
state
the
undisputed
facts
to
the
court
and
just
a
fair
as
way
as
i
can
possibly
do.
i
will
leave
out
nothing
which
might
be
unfavorable
to
the
state
and
i
will
leave
out
nothing
which
would
be
favorable
to
the
state.
i
will
state
nothing
that
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
first,
the
petitioner,
arthur
thomas,
is
a
negro,
27
years
old,
male,
a
very
--
a
quite
large
man,
over
six
feet
tall.
he
is
of
normal
intelligence.
his
education
progressed
into
high
school.
he
served
in
the
united
states
navy,
but
it
doesn't
appear
how
many
years
although
we
know
that
he
was
there
in
1942,
when
he
was
in
the
brig
and
he
was
there
in
1946
when
he
was
in
the
brig.
he
had
been
in
jail
as
a
juvenile.
he
had
been
in
prison
twice
on
felonies.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
convicted
and
actually
served
time.
one
--
or
the
last
time,
i
believe,
was
for
a
felony
in
the
state
of
texas.
he
received
a
five-year
sentence
and
serve
14
months
of
it.
now,
when
he
was
arrested,
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
rope
was
thrown
around
his
neck
by
two
irresponsible
people
who
were
no
part
of
the
official
sheriff's
posse.
the
state
of
arizona,
i
will
confess,
is
not
proud
of
that
fact.
however,
we
do
not
believe
that
that
fact
should
be
exaggerated
and
over-emphasized
and
magnetized
to
where
the
entire
picture
is
clearly
thrown
out
of
focus.
the
undisputed
evidence
is
that
the
sheriff,
himself,
did
take
the
rope
off
in
each
instance.
now,
it
is
the
claim
of
the
petitioner
that
the
confession
which
was
actually
introduced
in
evidence
was
the
product
of
the
fear
created
by
the
throwing
of
this
rope.
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
time
this
rope
was
thrown,
at
the
time
that
the
controverted
facts
state,
the
sheriff
said,
“if
you
don't
tell
the
truth
i
will
let
them
use
this.”
that
it
wasn't
--
it
didn't
create
such
a
furious
to
cause
him
to
confess
because
he
didn't
confess.
he
said
that
he
didn't
do
it,
but
he
knew
he
did
and
he
pointed
out
a
17
year
old
negro
boy
as
the
person
who
had
actually
committed
the
crime.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
is
controverted,
if
the
court
please,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
sheriff
made
the
statement
is
controverted
by
every
witness
who
testified
--
who
was
there
with
the
exception
of
the
highway
patrolman.
in
other
words,
it's
the
word
of
highway
patrolman
against
all
of
these
other
people.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
in
--
in
the
record,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
in
the
typewritten
record,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
--
that
is
true,
if
the
court
please.
that
in
order
to
properly
present
this
question,
we
decided
that
if
we
made
it
a
part
of
the
written
record,
we
would
have
to
print
practically
the
entire
eight
volumes,
because
all
of
these
circumstances
in
one
way
or
another
have
a
bearing
upon
those
questions.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
--
depends
on
the
briefs.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
i
was
the
county
attorney
who
will
--
involved
in
the
case,
i
tried
it
the
superior
court.
but
i
did
not
choose
to
run
for
county
attorney
that
i
went
into
private
practice
one
year
ago,
but
i
have
been
retained
by
the
state
with
the
sole
purpose
of
arguing
this
case,
but
i
didn't.
i
participated
in
writing
the
brief,
but
i
didn't
to
get
into
the
case
at
the
time
that
the
--
the
--
arrangement
made
for
the
record.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
out
of
interest,
sir.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
was
taken
in
my
home.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
one
was
never
offered.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
purpose
in
putting
it
here,
if
the
court
please,
was
that
it
was
made
a
part
of
the
record
before
the
district
court.
it
was
attached
to
my
affidavit.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
federal
district
court.
yes,
sir.
to
show
that
there
couldn't
have
been
too
much
fear
in
the
heart
and
mind
of
arthur
thomas
at
the
time
that
he
made
the
statement
before
judge
frazier,
because
he
had
absolutely
denied
any
guilt
to
me,
deny
it
before.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
was
on
the
17th.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
now,
to
get
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
will
explain
that,
if
the
court
please
in
this
way.
that
in
the
auxiliary
hearing
which
was
the
one
held
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
judge
making
up
his
mind
whether
it
should
be
admitted
or
not,
the
state
put
on
all
of
the
officers
who
were
present
at
that
time
in
order
to
lay
the
foundation.
mr.
morgan
cross-examined
those
officers.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
who
was
that?
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
is
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
all
--
all
of
the
county
officers,
i
will
correct
myself.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
sir.
we
also
put
on
a
--
probably
the
only
unbiased
witness
who
was
there,
that
was
(inaudible)
byrd,
a
storekeeper
who
was
there
at
all
of
the
time
that
these
ropings
were
supposed
to
have
happened.
he
testified
that
he
was
there.
he
was
there
under
circumstances
were
he
could
have
heard
everything
that
was
said
that
he
didn't
hear
sheriff
howard
say
anything
like
that.
he
didn't
hear
any
other
person
to
say
anything
like
that.
the
deputy
sheriffs
who
were
there,
testified
to
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
this
issue
was
going
to
be
raised.
the
court
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
it
--
in
fact,
to
the
--
there
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no.
we
anticipated
that
this
question
was
going
to
be
raised.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
question
about
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
--
the
question
as
to
the
involuntary
nature
of
the
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
and
that
is
why
the
foundation
was
being
laid
in
respect
to
all
of
the
confessions
not
this
one,
especially.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
under
the
law
of
arizona,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
he
can
hear
that
preliminary
evidence
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
or
he
can
go
ahead
and
require
that
the
foundation
be
laid
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
in
this
case,
the
court,
in
an
abundance
of
caution,
required
the
state
to
lay
its
foundation
in
the
absence
of
the
jury,
first.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
everybody
agreed
that
there
should
be
a
preliminary
hearing.
but
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
sheriff
testified.
i
believe
two
deputy
sheriffs,
who
were
there
in
that
particular
time
testified
and
this
storekeeper
testified.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
sheriff
said
that
he
did
not
say
any
such
thing
and
that
he
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
was
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
mr.
morgan
brought
the
matter
out
in
the
cross-examination
of
each
one
of
these
state
witnesses.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
so
is
the
record
stands
before
this
court,
the
patrolman
testified
that
the
sheriff
made
this
threat.
the
other
witnesses
testified,
that
is
the
other
three
or
four
who
testified,
that
sheriff
howard,
himself,
did
not
make
the
threat
and
further
that
no
one
made
a
threat
in
their
presence.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
was
resolved
by
the
state
court
in
favor
of
the
state.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
don't
believe,
if
the
court
please,
that
any
application
was
ever
made
to
the
federal
court
for
additional
testimony
concerning
this
particular
issue.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
won't
say
that
because
i
don't
know
exactly
what
mr.
morgan
did.
i
do
know
that
--
that
--
the
district
court
determined
that
he
could
make
a
fair
evaluation
of
the
question
by
a
review
of
the
state
record.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
you
mean
--
if
the
court
please,
the
same
foundation
evidence?
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
substantially
the
same
foundation
evidence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
on
that
point.
i'm
--
i'm
safe
in
saying
that.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
he
testified
there
before
the
jury
and
he
was
cross-examined
on
that
point?
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
there
was
a
violent
dispute
as
to
that
statement.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
was
under
the
instructions
which
were
copied
from
the
lyons
case.
it
was
approved
by
this
court
and
were
in
--
i
believe
the
instruction
was
improved
upon
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
would
be
the
general
question,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
--
under
the
constitution
of
arizona.
the
court
couldn't
comment
upon
the
evidence.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
don't
believe
it
was
that
specific.
it
simply
told
the
jury
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
the
--
this
--
this
instruction
can't
be
termed
the
general
instruction.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
you
find
on
page
25
of
the
printed
record,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
under
the
constitution
of
arizona
that
the
court
may
not
comment
upon
the
evidence
or
singleout
any
--
any
evidence
in
its
instructions.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
didn't
make
my
point
clear.
the
--
the
question
of
whether
the
sheriff
made
this
thing
or
whether
he
didn't,
certainly
was
put
to
the
district
court.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
but
as
part
of
--
of
--
that
was
the
main.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
now,
if
i
might
briefly
run
through
the
other
events
in
the
chronological
order,
i
think
that
--
that
i
can
orient
the
court
as
to
actually
what
happened
in
this
series
of
events
or
after
this,
the
--
the
incident
we're
talking
about
that
the
petitioner
saw
the
other
negro
boy,
cooper,
later
cross
a
field
where
he
was
apprehended
to
the
sheriff's
car
with
a
rope
of
the
same
car
(inaudible)
around
his
waste.
he
also
saw
the
sheriff
take
the
rope
off
and
admonished
the
cop
ranchers
to
desist.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
well
--
the
petitioner
and
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
all
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
just
now
giving
ultimate
facts
as
which
i
have
claimed
to
undisputed
facts
that
it
is
the
--
the
result
of
all
the
witnesses'
testimony
that
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
all
of
this
testimony
that
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
various
officers
involved.
there
--
there
was
no
attempt
to
hide
anything.
the
officers
told
the
story
exactly
as
it
happened.
all
that
i
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
have
no
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
have
no
doubt
of
that,
if
the
court
please
though.
our
deputies
say
that
they
did
not
hear
that,
that
they
heard
no
one
say
that.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that's
correct.
that
is
the
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
highway
patrolman?
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
highway
patrolman.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
don't
believe
so,
if
the
court
please.
this
storekeeper
who
had
no
interest
in
the
matter,
one
way
or
another,
testified
that
he
was
within
10
feet
of
where
this
conversation
was
suppose
to
have
been
taken
place
in
an
angry
tone
of
voice
and
he
testified
that
he
heard
nothing.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
sheriff,
himself
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
--
denied
it,
flatly.
what
you
see
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
about
six,
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that
wasn't
the
way
that
it
happened.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
court
must
remember,
this
man
was
apprehended
about
300
yards
off
of
the
county
road
in
a
(inaudible)
under
a
big
pile
of
tumbleweeds.
he
was
found
first,
by
officer
brashear
who
well
were
to
him
and
called
to
this
grocer
(inaudible)
byrd,
to
come
over.
these
other
officers
were
scattered
out
over
an
area
of
maybe
500
or
600
yards,
so,
each
of
them
got
to
the
scene
at
different
times.
now,
at
the
time
this
conversation
was
suppose
to
have
been
held,
they're
certainly
were
present,
arthur
thomas,
the
sheriff,
the
highway
patrolman,
deputy
sheriff
brashear
and
deputy
sheriff
(inaudible),
but
no
doubt
about
that
and
they
were
all
in
comparable
position
where
they
would
have
heard
anything
had
it
been
said.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
thomas
himself
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
he
was
not
a
witness
in
chambers.
they
didn't
ask
that
--
that
he'll
be
put
on
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
they
didn't
even
ask
that
he'd
be
put
on
under
limited
cross-examination.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
i
--
i
know
what
the
--
that
page.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
is
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
believe
that
under
the
rule
of
brown
versus
allen
there
was
sufficient
in
the
record
to
be
reviewed
by
the
federal
court
for
that
court
to
make
up
its
independent
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
due
process
have
been
violated
and
apparently
that
was
the
--
the
judge
mcculloch's
holding
and
also
the
--
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
court.
now,
if
the
court
would
permit
me,
i
would
like
to
run
through
the
subsequent
events
which
i
believe
are
very,
very
immaterial.
as
i
say,
after
thomas,
the
petitioner
was
apprehended
and
he
said
that
this
other
negro
boy,
cooper,
had
actually
committed
the
murder,
then,
the
party
went
to
another
field
which
was
two
or
three
miles
from
the
first
field
where
cooper
was
apprehended.
now,
i
believe
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
evidence
that
he
--
that
cooper
was
out
in
this
field
about
some
witnesses
say
a
half
a
mile
from
the
road
where
the
sheriff's
car
was
left,
(inaudible)
the
sheriff
went
over
there
unarmed.
he
got
cooper
and
the
same
cop
rancher
was
accompanying
the
sheriff.
he
threw
a
rope
around
cooper,
around
his
waste
and
he
was
laid
back
to
his
car.the
rope
was
taken
off
of
cooper
by
the
sheriff.
then,
while
the
two
of
them
were
standing
together,
the
same
cop
rancher.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no.
it
--
it
was
taken
off
--
i
believe
the
testimony
was
that
he
was
laid
about
50
feet
towards
the
car
and
then
the
rope
was
taken
off.
and
while
cooper
and
thomas
were
standing
there
being
questioned,
a
rope
was
thrown
around
the
two
of
them,
there
is
a
conflict
as
to
whether
or
not,
they
were
jerked
off
their
feet
or
not.
some
witnesses
say
that
they
were.
some
witnesses
say
that
they
weren't.
however
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
either
than
one
or
another
one.
there
were
two
cop
rancher
involved,
if
the
court
please.
there
are
only
two
men
on
horses.
now,
at
that
time
that
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted,
that
the
sheriff
got
mad
at
the
cop
rancher
which
certainly
took
considerable
time
in
doing
and
admonished
that
there
would
be
no
more
of
this.
and
from
that
time
on,
there
wasn't.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
he
was
there
if
the
court
please,
with
the
sheriff
in
the
sense
that
he
tagged
along
and
went
along,
but
there
was
no
official
posse
ever
selected.
that
is
true
that
these
two
men
were
--
were
there
on
horses.
they
--
they
were
helping
go
through
this
large
field
to
following
these
tracks
which
lead
to
the
finding
of
--
of
thomas
to
begin
with.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
doesn't
appear
whether
that
he
asked
them
or
not.
however,
we
concede
that
they
were
there
with
his
acquiescence.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
those
incidents
caused
fear
in
the
mind
of
thomas,
it
must
be
admitted.
he
didn't
confess
at
that
time.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
he
confessed
the
next
day.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
night,
about
7
o'clock.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
he
denied
guilt
at
that
time
and
--
and
still
insisted
that
this
young
17
year
old
boy
was
the
murderer.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
circumstances
the
next
day
is
that
--
that
he
got
up.
the
sheriff
--
the
night
before,
if
the
court
please,
his
upright
questioning,
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
where
his
hand
was
dressed
and
where
he
made
no
complaints
whatsoever,
about
any
roping
incident
or
about
any
damage
to
his
neck.
he
was
taken
to
jail
and
his
clothes
were
taken
from
him
because
we
wanted
to
use
them
as
evidence.
his
--
he
--
overalls
were
replaced
with
ordinary
jail
coveralls.
his
shoes
could
not
be
placed
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
sheriff
had
no
shoes
large
enough
to
fit
this
man.
the
next
morning,
he
was
taken
to
the
justice
of
the
peace,
judge
frazier,
the
magistrate
for
arraignment.
the
record
shows
that
he
was
barefooted.
now,
he
was
barefooted
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
still
couldn't
find
the
pair
of
shoes,
big
enough
to
fit
the
man.
when
the
sheriff,
it
must
be
conceded,
took
him
from
the
jail
down
to
the
lower
justice
court
which
by
the
way
isn't
any
converted
store.
it's
an
office
building,
the
justice
court
building
which
has
been
made
for
20
or
30
years.
the
sheriff
took
him
there
in
an
automobile
by
himself
and
believe
it
or
not
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
sheriff
had
a
gun
but
he
--
it
was
in
the
seat
between
him
and
the
petitioner.
when
he
got
to
the
justice
court,
the
petitioner
was
taken
into
the
justice
court.
there
were
two
men
in
the
justice
court
who
were
transacting
business
with
the
justice.
he
was
doing
some
notary
work
or
something
like
that
which
took
five
or
10
minutes.
when
the
work
was
finished,
the
next
order
of
business
was
the
arraignment
of
arthur
thomas.
the
justice
court
or
the
judge
asked
him
if
that
was
his
name
and
he
said,
“yes.”
the
justice
then
read
the
complaint
to
him,
told
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
--
to
employ
an
attorney
and
that
he
could
either
wave
his
preliminary
hearing
or
if
he
didn't
want
to
wave
the
preliminary
hearing,
one
would
be
held.
and
it
was
then
out
of
the
clearest
sky
with
no
prompting
from
anyone
that
the
petitioner
said,
“i
don't
need
a
lawyer.
i'm
guilty.
i
killed
a
woman.”
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
was
the
first
confession.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
we
--
we'll
find
that,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
as
i've
said,
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that
because
i
wasn't
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
must
hurry,
if
the
court
please.
my
time
is
growing
short.
that
after
the
two
men
were
put
in
the
automobile,
they
were
taken
to
willcox
at
a
distance
of
about
15
miles
to
the
nearest
justice
of
the
peace,
for
--
the
justice
was
out
driving
a
school
bus,
so
the
party
then
went
to
the
mortuary
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
picture
of
the
deceased.
the
photographer
was
riding
with
the
sheriff
that
i
don't
think
it's
a
fair
inference
from
the
testimony
that
--
that
the
petitioner
was
taken
there
to
view
the
remains.
it
was
simply
with
the
sheriff
and
this
photographer.he
certainly
was
enforced
to
--
to
view
the
remains.
the
party
was
then
taken
to
bisbee.
they
got
there
approximately
6:30
in
the
afternoon
after
the
local
justice
office
had
closed.
they
were
brought
to
my
house
for
this
simple
reason
that
i
was
in
the
stretcher
and
it
was
more
convenient
to
interview
them
there
than
it
was
for
me
to
be
loaded
into
an
ambulance
and
taken
to
the
courthouse.
i
questioned
each
of
the
negroes.
they
were
in
my
house
approximately
two
and
a
half
to
three
hours.
i
questioned
them
each
for
about
an
hour.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
was
the
afternoon
of
the
apprehension
on
march
the
17th.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
day
before,
yes,
your
honor.
then,
the
--
the
other
hour
in
the
three
was
taken
up
in
getting
a
court
reporter
down
there.
the
petitioner
gave
me
his
statement
was
an
accusation
against
the
other
boy
and
which
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
as
an
appendix.
at
that
time,
before
i
started
taking
this
statement
or
in
--
in
the
first
portion
of
the
statement,
i
advised
him
is
this.
“now,
you
know
that
i'm
the
county
attorney
of
this
county
here
and
all
of
these
gentlemen
around
here
are
either
deputy
sheriffs
or
deputy
county
attorneys.
i
want
to
ask
you
about
this
occurrence
and
kansas
settlement.
i
am
not
going
to
make
you
any
promises
if
you
do
talk
to
me
and
i'm
not
going
to
make
you
any
threats,
if
you
don't
talk
to
me.
whatever
i
ask
you,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
freely
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
truth.”
then,
he
started
telling
me
that
the
other
boy
done
it.
later,
when
we
were
finishing
up
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
pardon?
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
it
was
marked
for
identification,
but
it
was
never
used.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
district
court
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
in
the
federal
court
and
it
was
considered
by
judge
mcculloch
in
the
federal
court.
now,
again
on
page
30
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
i
stated
this
to
him.
question,
“well,
i'm
going
to
let
you
go
now
for
a
little
while.
now,
everything
that
you
have
told
me
has
been
the
truth
hasn't
it?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.”
question,
“and
you
swear
to
god
that
it
is
the
truth?”
question,
“and
everything
you
told
me,
you
have
voluntarily
told
me
haven't
you?”
answer,
“yes.”
question,
“and
you
understand
like
i
told
you
when
we
started
that
i'm
not
making
you
any
promises
if
you
do
talk
to
me.
i'm
not
making
you
any
promises
if
you
don't
talk
and
i'm
not
making
you
any
threats
if
you
don't
talk,
you
understand
that?”
question,
“and
you
understand
that
when
you
started,
you
didn't
have
to
talk
to
me
unless
you
wanted
to
--
to,
do
you
understand
that?”
now,
after
that
was
taken,
he
was
taken
back
to
the
jail.
the
next
day,
if
the
court
please,
which
--
no,
the
day
after
that
on
the
20th,
that
i
again
questioned
him
in
the
courthouse,
in
--
in
my
office
in
the
presence
of
a
different
set
of
officers
altogether,
sheriff
howard
or
none
of
the
officers
involved
in
his
arrest
were
there.
present
was
percy
bowden,
the
chief
of
police
of
douglas
and
a
--
i
mean
who
was
also
a
deputy
united
states
marshall.
at
that
time
that
arthur
thomas
was
shown
the
transcript
of
the
statement
that
he
had
made
me
at
my
home
and
he
read
it
and
initialled
it.
i
then
proceeded
to
question
him
again
in
the
presence
of
these
officers.
going
into
the
matter
much
more
in
detail
as
to
how
the
crime
was
committed,
he
gave
me
that
willingly
as
the
--
the
evidence
shows.
not
only
willingly
that
he
talked
to
me,
but
he
assisted
me
in
explaining
how
the
thing
had
happened
by
marking
a
big
diagram
with
crayons,
different
colored
crayons
as
we
went
along.
that
was
testified
too,
without
contradiction.
then,
11
days
after
that,
on
april
1st
after
this
statement
had
been
typed
up,
it
was
given
to
the
deputy
united
states
marshall
who
went
up
into
the
jail
and
interviewed
thomas
in
the
fingerprint
room
of
the
sheriff's
office,
not
in
any
cell
or
anywhere
else.
he
told
thomas
why
he
was
there
that
he
wanted
him
to
read
each
and
every
page
of
this
statement
if
it
was
the
truth
to
initial
it.
if
it
wasn't
the
truth
and
not
to
initial
it,
that
thomas
went
ahead
and
took
approximately
an
hour,
read
each
page,
initialled
it
as
he
went
along
and
then
signed
the
last
page.
now,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
thomas
was
in
fear
of
the
sheriff
himself,
i
would
like
to
read
the
court's
--
this
part
of
the
transcript.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no.
that
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
they're
not
in
the
printed
record
and
unfortunately,
they're
not
before
this
court.
i
thought
that
they
were.
however,
the
testimony
shows
generally
what
each
of
them
consisted
of.
and
the
testimony
shows
conclusively
that
the
man
was
advised
of
his
rights
at
the
beginning
of
each
statement
and
again
at
the
end
of
each
statement.
now
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
your
honor,
that
--
they
were
presented
to
the
court
while
we
were
laying
this
foundation.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
for
the
purpose
of
the
court
making
up
his
mind
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
testimony
should
be
put
to
the
jury.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
yes,
for
all
of
the
confessions.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
we
weren't
even
finished
laying
our
foundation
when
the
court
came
back
from
phoenix
over
a
weekend
and
while
mr.
morgan
was
making
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
on
something
else.
the
court
said,
“mr.
morgan,
i
am
going
to
deny
your
motion
for
a
mistrial,
but
i've
been
thinking
about
these
confessions
and
i'm
not
going
to
let
them
in.”
well,
it
never
been
even
offered
at
that
time.we
never
had
an
opportunity
to
argue
the
matter
to
the
court.
we
--
i
sincerely
believe
that
the
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
certainly
do,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
court
actually
made
this
is
what
i
would
like
to
--
to
--
this
is
what
the
court
actually
said.
it
appears
on
page
2063
of
the
record
in
the
superior
court.
the
court
--
well,
the
court
feels
this
way
about
it.
oh,
before
that
on
--
on
the
page
before
mr.
morgan
had
just
gotten
through
arguing
his
motion
for
a
mistrial,
the
court,
“do
you
have
something
mr.
polley?”
mr.
polley,
“nothing
except
that
we
--
we
resist
the
motion,
if
the
court
please,
which
resists
other
motion.”
the
court
--
well,
the
court
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
it
was
--
it
was
another
motion
all
together.
it
was
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
on
one
of
the
many,
many
numerous
grounds
that
were
urged.
the
court
said
this,
“well,
the
court
feels
this
way
about
it.
i
have
read
your
authorities
on
voluntary
and
involuntary
confessions.”
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
this
was
a
motion
for
a
mistrial.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that's
right.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
that
is
correct.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
about
the
whole
question,
i
imagine,
if
the
court
please,
that
i
--
i
reiterate
to
the
court.
we
haven't
completed
putting
our
foundation
testimony
when
the
court,
out
of
a
clear
sky,
made
this
statement
and
without
taking
the
time
of
the
court
to
read
it.
it
appears
on
page
2063
of
the
superior
court
record.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
there
is
no
finding
of
fact
to
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
i
--
i'll
read
it.
well,
the
court
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
believe
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
it's
possible
the
court
was
right
in
excluding
the
confession
to
the
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
believe
in
the
stroble
case
that
that
was
done,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
in
the
stroble
case,
if
the
court
please,
this
court's
decision
had
the
effect
of
overruling
the
supreme
court
of
california,
which
held
or
which
assumed
that
a
confession
was
--
was
involuntary
and
didn't
admit
it.
when
this
court
reviewed
it,
this
court
held
that
the
--
that
the
excluded
confession
was
actually
voluntary
and
should've
been
admitted.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
“i
have
read
your
authorities
on
voluntary
and
involuntary
confessions
and
i
have
studied
the
citations
carefully.
and
i
have
studied
the
exhibits
in
relation
to
those
and
the
court
recognizes
the
fact
that
the
friends
and
neighbors
of
the
deceased
might
well
have
been
highly
unjustifiably
incensed
on
finding
her
slain
body.
many
others
might
well
have
felt
the
same
way.
however,
neither
good
morals
nor
the
constitutions
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
arizona
will
tolerate
an
individual
or
a
group
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands.
there
are
countries
where
confessions
are
extorted
by
devious
and
improper
methods
that
run
countered
to
our
american
way
of
life
or
of
our
constitution.
our
ancestors
gave
us
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
law
of
due
process
and
to
scuttle
this
time
honored
in
sacred
laws
will
be
to
invite
anarchy
and
dictatorship.
the
court
will
not,
in
any
way,
honor
any
confession
cured
by
an
underthreat
of
attempted
lynching.
under
such
circumstances,
a
confession
is
not
voluntary
and
its
credibility
is
doubtful,
then
therefore
barred
by
our
constitution
and
the
court
therefore
feels
and
he
--
he
ruled."
now
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
“i
have
been
studying
the
matter.
counsel
brought
this
matter
to
a
hearing
before
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
have
been
studying
the
matter.
counsel
brought
this
matter
to
a
head
before
the
court
intended
saying
any
more
about
it,
but
since
counsel
has,
i
am
going
to
sustain
counsel's
objection
to
the
introduction
of
state's
exhibits
51
and
53
because
they
are
confessions
and
they
are
obtained
having
been
procured
by
threat
of
lynch
and
the
court
does
not
propose
to
be
a
party
in
any
ways
to
any
attempt
of
lynching,
and
i
will
deny
the
motion
for
mistrial.
that
takes
away
the
confession
that
you
say
that
percy
bowden
secured
and
it
takes
away
number
51.
i
believe
53
was
the
one
that
was
under
the
influence
of
percy
bowden.
now,
the
percy
bowden
incident,
mr.
morgan
was
asking
for
a
mistrial
upon
the
grounds
that
percy
bowden
had
taken
this
last
confession
to
thomas
in
jail
and
had
him
initial
it
after
counsel
was
appointed.
that
was
the
matter
that
was
before
the
court.
now,
the
--
the
important
thing
about
what
i
just
read,
if
the
court
please,
where
this
--
judge
jennings
mentions
threat
of
attempted
lynching.
at
that
time,
there
wasn't
one
word
in
the
record
about
any
attempted
lynching.
apparently,
that
judge
jennings
have
been
reading
the
newspapers
also.
there
wasn't
anything
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
this
ruling,
if
the
court
please,
was
made
during
the
time
we
were
holding
these
preliminary
hearings
and
before
we
had
completed
them.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
it
was
denied
by
the
officers
on
cross-examination.
no
affirmative
evidence
was
in
the
record
as
to
any
attempt
or
any
threat
of
lynching
had
ever
occurred.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
there
was
that
evidence,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this,
if
the
court
please.
now,
my
time
is
almost
up.
could
i
pass
to
one
more
subject
as
to
whether
or
not
these
--
or
that
thomas
was
actually
injured
or
the
defendant
put
on
a
newspaper
reporter
who
was
a
very
belligerent
witness
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned.
he
went
to
the
prison
on
either
the
18th
--
i'm
not
--
or
to
the
jail,
on
either
the
18th
or
the
19th
of
march
to
take
a
picture
of
the
petitioner
and
to
look
for
any
marks
or
bruises
which
might
be
on
his
body.
he
took
a
picture
of
him
and
that
was
introduced
in
evidence.
on
cross-examination,
he
was
asked.
question,
“and
the
picture
you
published
in
connection
with
the
story?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.”
question,
“and
the
footnote
to
the
picture
stated
this,
did
it
not?"
"the
six-foot
negro
agreed
with
howard's
statement
that
he
had
saved
the
farmworker's
life.”
answer,
“that
is
exactly
what
i
just
finished
saying.”
so,
there
is
no
doubt
that
on
the
18th
that
the
petitioner
did
concede
that
if
howard
had
any
part
in
his
roping
at
all,
it
was
as
his
benefactor
and
nothing
else.
now,
insofar
as
the
marks
are
concerned,
this
is
what
--
this
appears
on
page
1943
of
the
superior
court
transcript.
question,
“and
when
--
where
were
those
marks?”
answer,
“he
had
one
mark
on
the
--
a
very
small
minor
abrasion
on
the
left
side
of
his
neck
and
he
had
a
larger
abrasion
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
on
the
right
side
of
his
neck.”
now,
those
were
the
extent
of
the
injuries.
now,
mr.
pidgeon
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
court
upon
the
evidence
in
the
record
other
than
this
confession.
i
would
simply
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
under
the
ruling
of
this
court,
itself,
in
the
lisenba
case,
in
the
lyons
case,
in
the
gallegos
case
and
in
the
stroble
case
that
physical
abuse,
itself,
even
though
admitted,
isn't
sufficient
to
make
a
confession
involuntary.unless
that
it
is
going
further
and
shown
that
the
physical
abuse
did
create
some
inducement
or
some
fear
which
actually
produced
the
confession.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
it.
we
deplore
that
it
happened.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
sufficient
to
upset
the
conviction
of
the
state
court.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
do
not
believe
that
judge
jennings
ruled
on
that
particular
thing.
i
think
judge
jennings
in
an
outburst
of
--
of
indignation
as
to
the
--
brought
on
by
the
fact
that
this
roping
had
actually
happened,
said
in
short,
“i
am
not
going
to
permit
the
state
to
use
this
confession
after
that
happened.”
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
question
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
there
was
fear
or
whether
there
wasn't
fear.
we
have
no
opportunity
to
argue
the
time
sequence
of
these
various
confessions
and
i'm
certain
that
judge
jennings
never
realized
it.
that
is,
i
reiterate,
we
haven't
finished
our
foundation.
we
had
never
offered
a
single
one
of
these
confessions
at
the
time
that
he
ruled
out
the
ones
that
he
did.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
do,
your
honor,
and
under
the
authority
of
the
stroble
case.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
sincerely
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
well,
the
simple
reason
that
it
may
have
been
judge
jennings'
idea
that
after
the
confession
was
made
to
judge
frazier
in
the
sanctity
of
this
court
where
there
was
no
mob
present,
no
anything,
or
it
couldn't
reasonably
be
--
be
believed
that
any
harm
was
going
to
come
to
the
defendant.
that
that
confession
was
admissible
while
a
later
confession
given
to
me
in
my
home
in
the
presence
of
these
officers
and
a
later
confession
given
to
me
in
my
office
in
the
presence
of
officers,
although
different
ones,
that
there
was
a
sufficient
change
of
circumstances
as
of
--
of
this
court
has
well
emphasized
in
the
lyons
case.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
none
whatsoever.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
think
that
the
judge
ruled
prematurely.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
think
that
--
that
judge
jennings
ruled
prematurely
without
a
--
a
careful
consideration
of
the
facts.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
must
be
consistent.
i
believe
that
each
of
the
confessions
was
admissible
and
all
that
i
ask
is
that
the
court
examined
the
facts
under
the
light
of
the
decisions
on
the
haley
case
and
the
malinski
case,
considered
the
undisputed
facts
and
then
way
those
undisputed
facts
against
the
law
of
due
process.
i
think
that
i'm
confident
if
that
is
done
that
this
conviction
will
be
upheld.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
do
not
believe
that
the
leyra
case
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case
upon
the
merits
that
there
is
--
is
--
a
mere
reading
of
that
case
is
revolting.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
is
revolting.
that
is
the
facts
in
that
case
is
to
what
was
done
with
the
defendant
in
that
case
by
going
back
to
the
--
the
various
reports
in
--
in
the
state
courts
and
the
--
the
report
in
this
--
from
this
court
that
that
man,
there
was
every
advantage
taken
on
the
man.
it
was
done
in
that
case
where
he
was
questioned
for
hour
after
hour
after
hour
without
proper
care
where
he
was
--
they
knew
that
he
was
sick.
that
is
the
officer's
did.
so,
he
asked
for
a
doctor
and
they
brought
in
a
doctor
who
he
thought
was
a
doctor,
but
he
wasn't
a
doctor.
he
was
a
state
agent
and
by
the
use
of
the
confidential
relationship
between
this
doctor
and
the
patient,
where
the
--
the
doctor,
he
didn't
exactly
threatened
him,
but
he
offered
all
the
inducements
in
the
world
that
he
wasn't
--
he
stated
to
him,
“you're
not
more
than
guilty.
that
it'll
be
better
if
you
would
go
ahead
and
tell
us
what
happened.
now,
why
don't
you
tell
us
what
happened,
and
so
forth."
that
--
that
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
in
the
--
the
distinction,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
in
the
leyra
case,
all
of
the
confessions
were
secured
within
a
period
of
five
hours.
there
was
certainly
no
change
of
circumstances.
i
--
i
believe
that
the
effect
of
promises
of
leniency
are
much
more
far
reaching
and
continue
much
longer
than
--
than
threats
of
violence.
if
--
if
thomas
in
this
case,
had
any
idea
that
he
was
going
to
suffer
physical
punishment
if
he
didn't
confess
from
what
happened
out
there
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
i
think
that
they
were
dispelled
when
i
advised
him
of
his
rights
and
when
he
still
didn't
confess
when
he
was
put
back
in
the
--
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
and
he
still
didn't
suffer
any
abuse
when
even
the
next
morning,
he
went
to
the
justice
court
that
no
abuse
was
offered
to
him
that
--
i
simply
can't
see
why,
if
there
was
any
fear
that
it
wasn't
broken
at
the
time
that
i
talked
to
him.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
he
did
with
--
with
--
in
connection
with
the
confession
which
was
admitted
and
i
--
i
don't
wish
to
be
a
repetition
--
repetitious
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
trial
court's
ruling
on
the
other
confession
was
--
was
seriously
considered.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
when
it
was
first
admitted
before
the
jury.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
there
was
no
objection
until
the
statement
was
in
evidence.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
they
objected
to
upon
improper
grounds.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
he
objected
on
the
ground
practically
every
amendment
except
the
fourteenth.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
the
court
made
practically
the
same
argument
that
i
have
made
here
that
there
was
sufficient
change
of
circumstances
to
where
the
one
did
necessarily
control
the
other.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
yes.
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
can
tell
the
court
where
it
is.
it
--
it
is
right
after
selchow
testified.
see,
after
--
after
the
highway
patrolman
testified
that
mr.
morgan
made
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
at
that
time
when
this
matter
was
thoroughly
argued
to
the
court.
but
mr.
pidgeon,
informed
we
don't
have
that
volume,
that
it
would
be
--
mr.
wesley
e.
polley
i
will
do
so.
