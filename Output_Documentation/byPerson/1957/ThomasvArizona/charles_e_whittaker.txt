justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
told
us
yesterday,
i
believe,
how
that
happened,
did
you,
mr.
morgan,
this
injury
in
his
hand
would
have
anything
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
of
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
--
of
some
kind
of
a
hearing
before
the
district
court.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
you
filed
a
transcript
of
the
testimony.
justice

e.
whittaker
they
filed
the
transcript.
justice

e.
whittaker
what
is
the
answer
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
wait
a
minute,
i'm
getting
lost.
you
say
that
was
in
the
hearing
before
the
court,
at
chambers?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
how
had
there
been
an
issue
about
what
officer
selchow
was
going
to
say
if
he
hadn't
testified?
at
that
time,
officer
selchow
had
not
had
testified,
had
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then,
how
could
there
have
been
rebuttal
testimony
offered
before
the
court
in
chambers
on
the
matter
that
selchow
later
testified
about.
i
don't
understand
this
argument.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
you
anticipated
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
wasn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
you
say
brought
the
matter
out,
you
mean
he's
right
into
it?

(inaudible)
justice
charles

whittaker
the

actually
made
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
your
procedure,
an
appeal
is
allowed
from
the
judgment
and
also
a
separate
appeal
is
allowed
from
the
order
on
a
subsequent
motion
for
a
new
trial.
that
was
done
in
this
case
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
a
little
peculiar
to
me.
i've
never
heard
of
procedure
like
that,
but
let
me
ask
this
question.
is
it
your
position
that
a
petition
for
certiorari
must
have
been
filed
insofar
as
it
--
to
sought
review
of
the
judgment
of
guilty
within
the
60
days
after
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
arizona
of
the
judgment
of
guilty?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
90
days
and
that
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
was
a
separate
appeal
was
a
separate
proceeding,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
