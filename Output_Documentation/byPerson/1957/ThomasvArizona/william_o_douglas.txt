this
conflict
in
the
testimony

and
the
other
officers,
does
--
was
resolved
by
then
the

justice
william

but
in
the
federal
court,
the
petitioner
was
not
allowed
to
have
a
hearing
on
that
issue
though?

what

on
the

it
appears
that

at
the
bottom
of
page

the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
submitted
that
the
district
court
erred
and
not
granting
the
defendant
the
right
of
his
opinion
and
bring
forward
the
witness
to
show
how
the
defendant's
rights
have
been
violated.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
petitioner
asked
for
that,
in
his
petition
and
he
listed
a
series
of
witnesses
who
he
wanted
to
call
that
each
of
those
witnesses
had
testified
in
the
superior
court
with
the
exception
of
one
major
dorsey
who
according
to
the
application,
it
doesn't
appear
as
to
what
he
could
testify
to.
certainly,
he
wasn't
there.
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
what's
the
relevance
in
that
here
as
to
take
this
purpose
of
the
federal
--
justice
william

douglas
did
he
file
(inaudible)
come
to
our
attention
that
there's
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
--
that's
stroble,
as
i
remember,
that
that
being
irrelevant,
the
confession
was
involuntary.
