mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
very
apparent
and
the
court
will
see
it
as
we
proceed
that
it
couldn't
be
a
more
varied
opinion
or
at
more
opposite
end
to
many
pole
as
my
good
friend
mr.
friedman
and
i
as
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
and
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
two
decisions
which
have
resulted
in
the
matter
being
before
you
today.
we
are
agreed
specifically,
however,
in
their
brief
and
in
ours
on
one
matter
and
that
is
this.
the
statute
in
its
very
language
does
not
prohibit
tie-in
sale.
that
it
is
necessary
that
a
broad
interpretation
at
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
distilled
brands
case,
it
is
necessary
that
a
broad
interpretation
be
applied
to
the
statute
before
it
can
be
applied
to
the
practice
of
tie-in
sales.
the
second
circuit
based
its
decision
on
two
major
premises
that
tie-in
sales
being
reprobated
generally
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
affecting
commerce
were
therefore
reprobated
under
this
statute
because
the
treasury
department
had
a
contemporaneous
and
consistent
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
that
effect.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
however,
the
second
circuit
was
justified
in
its
decision
in
the
facts
before
it
but
the
second
circuit
did
not
have
before
it
matters
which
are
before
us
and
those
are
matters
that
relate
to,
first,
the
congressional
intent
and
secondly
to
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
we
will
not
read
this
statute
broadly
because
it
appears
to
us
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
tie-in
sales
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
administrative
determination
to
support
the
decision
in
the
distilled
brands
case
because
it
did
not
have
before
it
a
very
important
letter,
written
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
by
the
acting
president
or
acting
secretary
of
the
treasury,
a
letter
which
naturally
the
government
has
sought
to
slur
over
and
to
deprecate
but
which
is
very
important
in
the
consideration
of
this
case.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
the
second
circuit
also
did
not
seem
to
have
before
it
certain
of
the
material
which
was
in
the
fifth
circuit
as
to
the
reports
of
the
congressional
committees
on
the
statute
and
i
have
examined
the
briefs
in
the
second
circuit
case
and
found
that
they
have
some
of
the
material
before
but
did
not
have
all
of
that
material
which
we
presented
to
the
fifth
circuit.
this
letter
is
important
to
us
because
of
the
argument
which
has
been
made
by
counsel
that
in
1946,
some
146
suspension
orders
were
issued
based
on
tie-in
sales.
in
the
treasury's
own
language,
there
was
no
problem
apparently
of
tie-in
sales
until
1946
at
which
time
it
issued
show
cause
orders
to
a
great
number
of
retailers.
those
show
cause
orders
were
dismissed,
dismissed
on
a
stipulation
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
our
case,
the
stipulation
said
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
it
was
not
to
be
used
to
the
prejudice
of
the
parties
to
the
stipulation
in
any
other
legal
proceedings.
immediately,
after
this
stipulation,
they
addressed
this
letter
to
congress
and
they
said,
we
interpret
this
statute
to
apply
the
tie-in
sale
but
we
have
doubt
whether
we
can
sustain
our
interpretation.
furthermore,
the
industry
says
that
the
statute
applies
to
exclusive
outlets
and
tied
houses
and
therefore
we
asked
the
congress
to
clarify
this
and
to
put
in
section
5
(c)
of
the
act
precise
language
defining
a
tie-in
sale.
on
two
subsequent
occasions,
the
treasury
department
sought
again
to
introduce
legislation
specifically
reprobating
and
prohibiting
tie-in
sales
and
on
every
occasion
those
fail.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
yes
it
is
but
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
the
list
i
get
out
of
the
letter
is
that
the
decision
say
that
the
court
may,
if
it
will,
give
weight
to
a
contemporaneous
and
a
consistent
administrative
policy
and
the
distilled
brands
case
found
that
there
was
such
a
contemporaneous
consistent
policy.
but
here,
the
department
comes
along
and
says,
first,
it
wasn't
contemporaneous
because
we
didn't
make
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
apply
the
tie-in
sales
until
1946.
the
statute
was
enacted
in
the
1930s.
secondly,
it
says,
we
have
doubt
whether
we
can
successfully
enforce
the
statute.
i
believe
that
--
that
should
negate
the
position
that
the
treasury
department
had
a
consistent
and
a
contemporaneous
policy
which
would
support
a
court's
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
that
therefore
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
in
not
following
the
administrative
interpretation
but
applying
the
only
white
light
of
its
own
inquiry
into
the
meaning
of
the
statute
based
upon
the
congressional
reports
and
the
very
language
itself.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
the
two
provisions
which
the
government
seeks
to
enforce
in
this
case
and
we
have
set
out
a
definition
of
tie-in
sales
and
i
submit
that
you
will
find
that
they
are
synonymous
and
that
a
very
broad
interpretation
of
the
language
must
take
place
to
include
the
offense
of
a
tie-in
sale
and
to
even
a
partial
exclusive
outlet
or
a
partial
tied
house.
in
addition
to
the
position
in
that
regard,
may
i
point
this
out
to
the
court
also
a
factor
which
i
think
is
also
pointed
up
in
the
distilled
brands
case
and
by
the
government
in
its
argument.
and
that
is
the
idea
of
a
requirement.
section
5
(a)
says
that
where
a
wholesaler
requires
a
retail
to
take
his
product
in
exclusion
of
others
whether
it
is
in
whole
or
in
part,
referring
to
the
concept
of
an
exclusive
outlet
which
congress
said
was
bringing
about
certain
social
as
well
as
the
treasury
department
(inaudible)
where
the
wholesaler
dominated
the
retailer
so
that
he
took
all
his
particular
product
to
all
of
his
particular
wine.
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
alleged.
there
is
nothing
proven
that
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
in
this
case,
the
wholesaler
required
the
retailer
in
this
case
to
do
anything
whatsoever.
the
entire
proof
in
the
entire
allegation
is
that
the
wholesaler
said
to
the
retailer,
if
you
want
my
scarce
item,
you
can't
have
it
alone.
you
have
to
have
some
of
my
other
products
to
merit
my
scarce
items
if
you
want
blended
whisky
in
the
form
of
7-crown
or
if
you
want
gin,
you
may
have
it
along
with
the
item.
but
at
no
time
and
it
certainly
isn't
contended
by
the
government
at
no
time
did
the
wholesaler
say
to
the
retailer,
if
you
don't
buy
my
v.o.
and
you
don't
buy
my
7-crown,
you
can't
buy
from
me
at
all.
you
must
buy
from
me.
the
wholesaler
at
all
times
was
willing
to
sell
the
items
that
were
in
common
demand
and
in
supply.
the
wholesaler
would
have
sold
the
7-crown.
the
wholesaler
would
have
sold
the
gin.
the
wholesaler
in
this
case
as
it's
pointed
out
in
the
record,
carry
some
40
or
50
brands
of
other
items,
anything
could
have
been
purchased
except
for
the
retailer
to
merit
items
in
short
supply
in
the
language
of
the
wholesale.
he
had
to
have
a
reasonable
purchasing
record
and
in
this
case,
these
men
said,
we
knew
we
had
to
buy
other
products
and
so
we
bought
them.
one
of
the
host
--
the
retailer
said,
we
knew
that
it
was
our
obligation
to
buy
the
entire
line
and
at
no
time
anywhere
in
this
record
do
you
find
any
wholesaler
saying
any
retailer
saying
that
i
am
dominated
by,
i
am
controlled
by
or
i
am
even
influenced
by
this
wholesaler.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
the
exclusive
outlet
is
to
require
by
agreement
or
otherwise
that
a
retailer
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
yes.
it
was
a
contemporaneous
agreement.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
--
purchase,
it
is
illegal
agreement
to
purchase
any
such
products
to
the
exclusion
or
in
part
of
the
distilled
spirits
of
another
purchase.
we
contend
that
there
was
no
requirement.
the
record
shows,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
was
no
requirement.
mr.
(inaudible)
said
he
didn't
buy
anything.
i
didn't
buy
any
7-crown.
i
didn't
buy
any
v.o.
i
got
the
v.o.
i
wanted
last
time
and
i
didn't
want
anything.
nobody
required
him
to
do
anything.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
well,
may
i
point
out
that
on
that
regard,
out
of
the
eight
retailers
called,
only
one
testified
that
he
bought
--
that
he
was
excluded
from
the
market
of
buying
any
other
product.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
well
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
when
the
i
--
i
feel
that
the
phrase
to
the
exclusion
in
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
--
in
this
statute
is
jurisdictional.
i
recall
a
concurring
opinion
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
and
i
believe
the
frankfort
distilleries
case
when
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
there
was
an
abridgement
of
the
commerce
clause
and
you
held
and
rightly,
twenty-first
amendment
did
not
abridge
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
i
feel
that
the
--
to
the
exclusion
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
as
set
forth
in
this
statute,
relates
to
the
concept
of
the
necessity
of
their
being
an
interstate
commerce
feature
to
this
case
before
the
department
had
any
jurisdiction
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
i
feel
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
we
have
a
much
more
limited
and
much
more
confined
phase
of
an
unfair
trade
practice
as
we
have
in
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act
or
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
the
ins
--
exclusion
must
be
an
interstate
commerce
whereas
the
exclusion
is
not
an
interstate
commerce,
you
have
no
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
--
phase
at
all.
now,
in
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
well,
the
interstate
commerce
point
was
raised
by
us
with
the
effect
fact
that
there
is
no
substantial
exclusion
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
was
a
factor
which
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
did
not
consider.
the
fifth
circuit
said
there
were
another
other
--
a
number
of
other
factors
in
this
case
which
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
yes.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
yes,
it's
in
the
statute
and
it
is
likewise
in
the
(voice
overlap)
to
cite
that
brief
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
--
excluded
interstate
commerce.
it
excludes
the
product
of
other
wholesalers
to
such
an
extent
as
to
amount
to
a
deprivation
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
the
exact
language.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
it
does
say
substantially.
i'm
trying
to
find
it
in
the
government's
brief.
page
3,
substantially
to
restrain
or
prevent
transactions
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
i
think
the
court
has
also
held
in
the
atlanta
law
in
these
cases
that
substantial
was
quantitative
and
in
that
case
where
some
two
or
three
percent
of
the
business
was
all
that
was
involved,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
substantial
restraint
and
i
think
in
the
times-picayune
case
which
arose
in
our
own
jurisdiction,
it
was
pointed
out
there
that
substantial
was
a
quantitative
matter
and
in
that
case,
the
court
went
to
great
length
to
point
out
that
the
dominant
position
of
the
newspaper
was
based
upon
a
quantitative
approach
as
to
what
its
effect
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
i
think
the
quantity
related
to
the
two
competitors
to
the
effect
of
the
action
on
interstate
commerce.
under
the
sherman
act,
i
think
the
court
has
held
in
the
international
salt
case
or
the
standard
oil
case
that
the
quantity
of
business
would
indicate
that
it
was
a
substantial
commerce
but
then
it
was
pointed
out
that
under
the
clayton
act,
that
you
had
not
only
to
consider
the
phase
on
interstate
commerce
but
the
relationship
of
the
parties
as
well
and
that
it
becomes
a
quantitative
concept.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
no,
sir,
because
it
was
not
the
rationale
at
all
of
the
fifth
circuit.
with
respect
to
205
(b),
i
believe
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
inquiry
into
that
section
that
the
tied
house
provision
wouldn't
apply
at
all.
in
the
first
place,
the
tied
house
provision
in
its
other
phases
such
signs
and
commercial
bribery,
relate
rather
to
something
which
the
wholesaler
is
giving
to
the
retailer
to
induce
him,
to
prejudice
him,
to
affect
him
in
some
way,
to
bribe
him
in
other
words
because
it's
called
a
commercial
bribery
statute
generally.
but
the
--
the
tied
house
idea
relates
to
a
quota.
it
relates
to
the
idea
that
you
must
take
25%
of
your
blended
whisky
from
us.
you
must
take
15%
of
all
you
buy
from
us.
it
talks
about
a
quota
in
the
very
provision
applied
to
this
case
by
requiring
him
to
take
a
quota.
there
is
no
requirement
in
this
case
argued
i'm
sure
that
anyone
attempted
to
force
a
quota
and
i
recall
in
the
argument
that
counsel
made
that
--
an
attempt
was
made
to
prove
a
pattern
that
you
had
to
take
so
many
cases
of
one
to
get
to
other.
i
might
point
out
that
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
that
was
absurd.
the
fifth
circuit,
if
you
will
bear
with
me
while
i
read
what
it
finds
as
a
matter
of
fact,
found
that
the
investigator
testified
that
in
his
effort
to
ascertain
whether
appellant
tying
v.o.
with
gin
and
other
products.
he
picked
isolated
invoices
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
a
pattern.
he
just
went
out
and
picked
isolated
ideas
to
prove
a
pattern.
in
other
words,
to
prove
a
quota,
to
prove
a
relationship
but
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
any
quota.
and
i
submit
that
if
we
went
in
to
this
man
and
said,
you
must
purchase
all
of
your
blended
whisky
from
us.
that
is
a
violation
of
section
5
(a).
if
we
went
to
him
and
said,
we
don't
care
what
you
buy
from
us
but
you
must
buy
15%
of
your
product
from
us
or
you
must
buy
5%
of
your
product
or
you
must
buy
a
quota
from
us.
we
would
violate
section
5
(b).
but
what
we
are
accused
up
of
saying
to
this
man
in
this
case
is
not
a
tie-in
agreement
of
our
gasoline
to
our
pumps
or
our
ibm
cards
to
machines
over
a
long
course
of
time
related
to
a
monopolized
product
which
we
had
a
complete
control
as
in
the
ibm
case
but
we're
merely
accused
of
saying
to
these
people
in
a
time
which
the
government
recognized
is
a
time
of
scarcity
that
you
can't
just
purchase
from
us
only
of
our
scarce
product.
you
can
have
anything
else
you
want.
you
can
buy
as
much
or
as
little
as
you
want.
but
if
you're
going
to
buy
our
scarce
product
then
you've
got
to
buy
something
else
otherwise
how
can
we
distribute
the
scarce
product
and
that
there
is
no
element
of
requirement
there.
we
have
no
dominance
over
this
retailer.
we
have
no
control
of
it.
he
can
do
exactly
as
one
of
the
men
in
this
case
did.
i
don't
want
to
buy
anything
from
you
today.
i
don't
want
to
buy.
he
has
complete
control.
there's
no
dominance
and
that
leads
me
frankly
into
the
major
reason
we
believe
that
section
5
(a)
and
5
(b)
do
not
apply
to
a
tie-in
sale.
it
is
pointed
out
in
both
of
our
briefs
that
under
the
times-picayune
case
which
summarized
the
jurisprudence
on
tie-in
agreements
that
the
major
reason
that
tying
agreements
are
reprobated
is
because
of
their
effect
on
commerce
that
they
do
affect
commerce,
that
they
reduce
competition.
if
you
will
read
these
congressional
reports
at
least
as
we
see
them.
we
submit
that
the
congressional
report
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
not
to
set
up
along
with
the
antitrust
statute
in
the
clayton
act
and
the
robinson-patman
act
and
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
another
broad
concept
of
unfair
competition
but
rather
a
statute.
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
govern
the
relationship
between
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
in
a
very
limited
industry,
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
aimed
at
very
items
which
existed
before
prohibition.
the
reports
say
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
to
enact
as
much
of
the
codes
as
it
could.
we
grant
that
the
statute
went
beyond
the
code.
we
grant
that
it
says
in
whole
or
in
part
but
we
don't
believe
that,
such
action
takes
it
from
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute
which
was
to
govern
the
beverage
industry,
the
relationship
of
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer.
now
if
that
is
the
rationale
of
the
statute,
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
tying
agreement
say
that
the
effect
of
a
tie-in
sale
as
between
the
two
parties
not
on
the
question
of
commerce
but
on
the
two
parties
is
solely
to
abridge
the
judgment
of
the
purchaser
as
to
the
tied
product.
the
court
would
have
to
say
then
that
this
abridgement
in
isolated
cases
in
a
particular
period
of
time
was
such
an
action
of
domination
and
control
by
a
wholesaler
over
a
retailer
that
it
was
an
incipient
tendency
to
a
monopoly
in
order
for
it
to
meet
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
we
see
it.
and
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
that
is
not
the
case
here,
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
i
don't
think
it's
contended
or
urged
if
there
was
any
domination
or
control
or
monopolistic
tendency.
the
contention
is
that
you
cannot
have
a
tie-in
sale
because
it
is
assumed
and
is
particularly
assumed
by
the
second
circuit
that
every
tie-in
sale
excludes
the
purchase
of
another
item.
this
record
is
absolute
proof
that
you
can't
make
such
an
assumption.
one
of
the
wholesaler
said
as
mr.
friedman
point
out,
all
this
meant
to
me
was
that
i
bought
a
large
quantity
now
and
i
kept
it
here
until
i
sold
it
but
i
bought
everything
else
that
i
needed.
the
other
one
said,
i
continued
to
buy
all
of
the
other
products
that
i
had
to
buy
that
i
wasn't
stopped
from
buying
other
gins
when
i
bought
seagram's
v.o.
the
other
one
said,
i
understood
this
as
a
concept
of
a
sales
practice
to
put
on
the
market
all
brands
through
a
retail
but
it
didn't
stop
me
from
buying
anything
from
anyone
else
and
you
will
find
that
the
major
competitors
name
time
and
time
again
throughout
the
record
show,
came
in
and
said,
they
sold
everything
they
have.
every
item
they
had,
they
sold.
so
the
basic
assumption
that
a
tie-in
sale
of
necessity
excludes
another
sale
is
not
basic.
it
is
not
sound
because
the
tie-in
sale
may
only
result
in
lesser
purchases
of
the
same
wholesaler
over
a
longer
period
of
time.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
well,
i'm
arguing
that
--
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
i'm
arguing
that
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i'm
arguing
it
to
show
that
to
render
a
decision
saying
that
a
tie-in
sale,
a
fortiori
results
in
an
exclusion
is
an
improper
assumption
to
be
made
as
the
basic
concept
of
holding
tie-in
sales
are
reprobated
by
the
statute.
i
do
say
that
the
record
does
not
show
exclusion.
we
believe
we
urged
that
to
the
fifth
circuit
also
and
that
is
--
they
would
consider
if
this
case
were
remanded.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
preadmitting
that
as
a
question
of
fact
in
this
case,
as
a
holding
by
the
court
in
this
case
that
those
facts
that
appear
in
the
record,
and
which
i've
cited
to
this
court
in
our
footnote,
are
an
effective
rebuttal
to
saying
that
it
is
a
legal
assumption
that
if
i
buy
one
product,
i
have
necessity
exclude
and
prevent
the
sale
of
another
because
as
a
practical
matter,
it
isn't
correct.
by
way
of
summary,
may
i
point
out
that
it
has
been
the
continuous
contention
in
this
case
that
the
statute
should
be
read
in
the
light
of
its
exact
language
in
applying
to
an
exclusive
outlet
and
a
tied
house
that
although
congress
knew
as
a
result
of
the
federal
trade
commission
case
versus
(inaudible)
that
there
was
such
thing
as
tie-in
sales.
they
had
no
time
included
them
specifically
in
the
statute
when
it
was
enacted
that
the
treasury
department,
which
was
the
author
of
this
legislation
did
not
include
it
and
in
its
letter
has
said
it
had
doubts
as
to
whether
it
was
included.
the
three
occasions
before
congress,
an
amendment
has
been
introduced
to
amend
the
statute.all
of
which
have
proved
a
point.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
considering
the
nature
of
the
statute,
considering
the
titles,
considering
the
fact
that
this
is
dealing
with
property
rights
which
are
going
to
be
taken
away
as
a
result
of
its
enforcement
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
criminal
proceeding,
we
do
not
believe
that
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
statute
should
be
made
for
such
a
broad
interpretation
in
our
eyes,
makes
a
permittee
act
at
its
peril
in
almost
all
of
its
actions.
now,
i
think
the
court
will
know
that
there
is
no
more
heavily
regulated
industry
in
the
world
than
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry,
than
the
liquor
industry.
they
even
go
so
far
as
to
prescribe
the
very
size
and
content
of
a
sign
to
be
on
the
outside
of
let
us
say
a
rectifying
plan.
for
12
years,
the
treasury
department
issued
no
rule,
no
directive,
no
positive
statement
and
no
promulgation
of
anything
that
a
tie-in
sale
was
considered
illegal.
suddenly,
it
did
come
forth,
but
when
it
did,
it
did
it
in
a
weekly
fashion.
it
dismissed
all
of
its
actions
and
it
declared
to
congress
and
to
the
industry,
we
have
doubts.
we
have
doubts
as
to
what
we
are
doing.
we
question
our
own
action.
mr.
moise
s.
steeg,
jr.
at
that
time,
sir
you
--
they
said
that
but
they
went
further
by
failing
to
take
any
action
from
1946
to
1952
when
this
case
came
about.
and
we
submit
that
the
fifth
circuit,
which
considered
this
entire
background,
was
correct
and
wholly
that
tie-in
sales
are
not
specifically
prohibited
under
the
provisions
of
sections
5
(a)
and
5
(b)
of
the
act.
