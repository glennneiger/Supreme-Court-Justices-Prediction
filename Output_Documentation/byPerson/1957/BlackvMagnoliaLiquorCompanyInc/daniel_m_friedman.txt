mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
is
whether
under
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
it's
illegal
for
a
wholesaler
of
alcoholic
beverages
to
engage
in
so-called
tie-in
sales
with
a
retailer.
that
is
sales
under
which
the
wholesaler
requires
the
retailer
as
a
condition
to
obtaining
wanted
items
in
alcoholic
beverages
to
purchase
unwanted
items.
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
contains
a
system
of
permits
for
wholesalers
under
which
a
wholesaler
cannot
operate
in
interstate
commerce
without
a
permit.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
given
authority
to
suspend
permits
under
a
statutory
provision
which
makes
compliance
with
certain
provisions
of
the
act
including
the
provisions
i
shall
discuss
in
a
moment,
a
condition
of
the
permit.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
the
assistant
regional
commissioner
to
whom
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
delegated
authority
to
suspend
basic
permits.
the
respondent
is
a
large
wholesaler
in
the
new
orleans
area
who
is
the
exclusive
distributor
of
seagram's
product
in
that
area.
the
assistant
regional
commissioner,
through
a
hearing
exam,
conducted
a
full
administrative
proceeding,
the
culmination
of
which
was
that
he
found
that
the
respondent
had
engaged
in
tie-in
sales
and
that
he
had
required
a
number
of
retailers
to
purchase
at
a
condition
to
getting
two
scarce
items
which
were
seagram's
v.o.canadian
whiskey
and
seagram's
johnny
walker
scotch.
two
items
which
is
found
were
either
not
wanted
or
were
in
long
supply,
namely
seagram's
ancient
bottle
gin
and
seagram's
7-crown
whiskey,
blended
whisky.
he
ultimately
imposed
a
15-day
suspension
of
the
respondent's
permit
for
violations
of
section
5
(a)
and
5
(b)
of
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
without
reaching
any
of
the
other
contentions
which
the
respondent
had
presented
to
the
court,
set
the
suspension
order
aside
on
the
ground
that
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
making
of
tie-in
sale
and
reaching
that
result,
it
recognized
that
it
was
disagreeing
with
a
contrary
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
in
a
case
entitled
distilled
brands
v.dunigan.
the
statutory
provisions
involved
in
this
case
is
set
forth
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief
and
a
section
of
the
act,
section
5
which
it
had
an
unfair
competition
and
unlawful
practices
and
this
section
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
wholesaler
to
require
by
agreement
or
otherwise
that
any
retailer
engaged
in
the
sale
of
distilled
spirits
purchased
any
such
products
from
such
person,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
this,
to
the
exclusion
in
whole
or
in
part,
in
whole
or
in
part
of
distilled
spirits
sold
or
off
it
was
sale
by
other
persons
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
tie-in
sale
under
which
a
wholesaler
requires
a
retailer
to
take
an
unwanted
product
as
a
condition
of
obtaining
a
wanted
product
excludes
in
part
the
tied
product,
the
unwanted
product
which
is
sold
or
offered
for
sale
by
other
wholesalers
of
alcoholic
beverages.
now
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
some
of
the
retailers,
who
testified,
stated
explicitly
that
if
they
had
not
been
required
to
purchase
certain
tied
products
from
the
respondent,
they
would
have
purchased
other
brands
of
these
products.
so
there
is
explicit
evidence
here
and
the
hearing
examiner
so
found
that
there
is
exclusion
of
the
tied
products.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice,
if
they
hadn't
taken
this
man's
gin,
they
wukk
report
someone
else's
gin.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
gin.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
this
particular
brand.
it
was
just
the
seagram's
gin
which
it
was
testified
it
was
more
expensive
amount
of
popular
gin.
now,
by
similar
reasoning
we
think
that
these
practices
also
violates
section
5
(b)
(7)
of
the
act
which
required
--
prohibits
a
wholesaler
from
inducing
any
retailer
to
purchase
distilled
spirits
from
him
to
the
exclusion
in
whole
or
in
part
by
requiring
the
retailer
to
just
take
and
dispose
off
a
quota
of
any
such
product
and
similarly
in
this
case,
there
was
a
showing
that
certain
quotas
was
set
up
in
order
to
get
five
bottles
of
one
thing,
he
had
to
buy
ten
of
another,
that
kind
of
quota.
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
think
without
analysis
of
this
precise
legislative
--
precise
language,
suggested
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
tie-in
sales
for
the
following
reasons.
it
stated
that
this
statute
grew
out
of
the
nra
“code
of
fair
competition”
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry,
that
under
the
code,
tie-in
sales
were
not
prohibited
and
that
this
statute
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
reenactment
of
certain
of
the
code
provisions
and
therefore
the
failure
in
specific
terms
to
outlaw
a
tie-in
sale
precludes
the
statute's
application
to
this
practice.
now
in
considering
this
contention,
we
think
it's
important
to
indicate
briefly
what
the
codes
purported
to
do
and
what
we
think
are
very
significant
changes
which
the
statute
made
in
the
code.
we
strongly
disagree
with
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
all
of
these
statute
represented
a
reenactment
of
the
code
provisions.
the
codes
were
drafted
shortly
after
prohibition
was
repealed.
at
that
time,
congress
was
not
in
session
and
the
nra
program
had
just
been
set
up
in
a
series
of
codes
of
the
various
phases
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry
were
promulgated.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
27
to
30,
one
of
the
particular
code
provisions
which
we
think
is
significant
in
the
wholesaler's
code
and
this
code
have
a
large
number
of
provisions
dealing
with
unfair
methods
of
competition.
section
8
of
the
code
which
is
set
forth
at
20,
page
29
of
our
brief
purported
to
regulate
control
of
retail
outlets
which
in
a
sense
is
similar
to
the
provisions
dealing
with
tied
hazards
in
section
5
(b)
and
section
11
of
the
code
captioned
exclusive
outlets,
purports
to
be
the
counterpart
of
the
present
section
5
(a).
but
these
provisions
dealing
with
exclusive
outlets
and
control
of
retail
outlets
were
very
limited.
in
the
first
place,
they
apply
only
to
sales
by
retailers
for
consumption
on
the
premise
as
the
bar,
cocktail
lounge
and
saloon.
they
did
not
purport
to
prohibit
these
practices
by
a
wholesaler
in
dealing
with
the
so-called
package
store.
secondly,
they're
just
blanket
prohibition.
there
is
no
reference
in
this
particular
provision
to
any
of
the
competitive
effects
of
the
practice.
but
when
congress
came
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
after
this
court
had
invalidated
the
nra
in
(inaudible)
case,
it
substantially
broadened
these
provisions.
in
the
first
place,
it
extended
the
prohibitions
not
from
the
whole
--
the
retailer
on
the
premises
but
the
man
who
also
sold
in
a
package
store.
but
more
significantly,
it
injected
a
new
element,
we
think,
into
the
concept
of
violation.
that
is
the
competitive
effect
of
these
practices.
the
statutes
initially,
the
code
rather
had
merely
prohibited
exclusive
sell
--
selling
in
--
in
a
way
that
require
him
to
handle
only
the
product
of
a
particular
wholesaler.
this
was
broadened
in
the
statute
to
cover
sales
which
result
in
the
exclusion
in
whole
or
in
part.
the
significant
fact
that
the
congress
injected
into
these
statute
was
that
it
excluded
in
whole
or
in
part
products
sold
by
other
persons,
product
sold
by
competitors
of
a
wholesaler.
the
same
language
is
found
in
section
5
(b)
of
the
act
and
also
in
section
(5)
(c)
of
the
act
which
prohibits
commercial
bribery.
all
three
sections
require
as
an
element
of
violation,
a
significant
element
that
the
effect
of
this
be
to
exclude
in
whole
or
in
part
products
offered
for
sale
by
competing
wholesaler.
and
indeed,
congress
put
in
another
provision
in
the
statute
in
section
8
which
prohibits
interlocking
directives
between
various
distillers
in
there.
it's
prohibited
unless
the
holder
of
the
directive
is
able
to
make
an
affirmative
showing
that
will
tend
to
interfere
with
competition.
the
reason
we
believe
that
these
provisions
were
injected
into
the
statute
is
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
which
we
will
prefer
to
you
briefly
on
page
20
of
our
brief
which
congress
indicated
what
it
was
seeking
to
do
in
these
prohibitions
under
section
5
on
unfair
methods
of
competition
was
to
prohibit
practices
which
tended
to
produce
monopolistic
control
of
retail
outlets
and
it
sought
to
strike
at
the
incipiency
of
monopolies
and
such
restraints.
and
it
further
stated
in
discussing
section
5
that
the
practices
condemned
in
that
section
are
analogous
to
those
prohibited
by
the
antitrust
laws.
tie-in
agreements
as
this
court
has
stated
in
(inaudible)
case
have
always
paired
harshly
under
the
antitrust
laws.
this
court
has
also
pointed
out
that
they
serve
no
purpose
other
than
the
suppression
of
competition
and
we
all
think
there
can
be
any
question
but
a
tie-in
practice
under
which
a
wholesaler
requires
a
retailer
to
purchase
unwanted
products
as
a
condition
to
buying
scarce
products
as
designed
only
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
on
the
retailer
the
particular
product
which
he
would
not
otherwise
buy.
in
the
distilled
brands
case,
judge
clark
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court
in
upholding
the
application
of
the
statute
to
prohibit
tie-in
sales
pointed
out
that
these
sales
have
a
double
effect.
in
the
first
place,
they
force
the
retailer
to
purchase
unwanted
products.
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
two
of
the
retailer
witnesses
testified
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
16
months
after
these
tie-in
practices
had
occurred,
they
still
had
on
their
shelves
some
of
the
items
which
they
have
been
forced
to
take
on
a
tied
basis.
the
second
element
which
judge
clark
point
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
because
if
it
speaks
of
exclusion
in
whole
or
in
part.
i'm
just
trying
to
indicate
the
kind
of
--
the
type
of
the
effect
of
this
practice
as
to
why
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is.
it
is
a
narrow
concept
but
believe
it
embodied
at
least
in
the
area
of
tie-in
sale
in
view
of
this
broad
language,
the
basic
concept
which
this
court
has
developed
with
respect
to
clients.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
the
other
effect
is
the
exclusionary
effect
on
the
competing
sellers
of
products.
now,
this
view
and
i'd
also
point
out
that
tie-in
sales
do
violate
the
act,
is
the
view
that
the
alcohol
administration
has
had
since
1946.
in
that
year,
it
brought
146
proceedings
against
virtually
the
entire
wholesale
industry
based
on
tie-in
practices.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
this
administrative
instruction
but
founded
unpersuasive
because
it
said
in
1947,
the
acting
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
recommended
to
congress
that
the
statute
be
amended
specifically
to
prohibit
tie-in
sale.
and
in
that
letter
which
is
set
out
at
pages
31
to
35
of
our
--
36
of
our
brief,
there
is
some
statement
that
the
court
construed
as
doubt
by
the
administrative
agency
as
to
validity
of
its
construction.
and
therefore
it
said
since
the
administrative
agency
had
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
its
interpretation,
that
interpretation
is
not
very
persuasive.
well,
i
think
the
letter
shows
that
the
doubt
they
had
was
not
a
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
their
construction
of
the
statute,
but
rather
a
doubt
as
to
whether
in
view
of
the
repeated
position
taken
by
the
industry
that
tie-in
sales
are
not
prohibited
whether
in
subsequent
proceedings
the
statute
would
be
held
to
prohibit
tie-in
sales
and
they
therefore
pointed
out
that
instead
of
bringing
criminal
proceedings
for
these
violations,
they
elected
to
institute
civil
proceedings
which
were
subsequently
settled
by
stipulation.
in
1946
and
1947,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
reported
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
he
did
construe
the
act
as
covering
tie-in
sales
that
it's
unequivocally
without
any
doubt.
furthermore,
the
mere
fact
that
a
bill
has
been
introduced
in
congress
without
any
further
congressional
proceeding
other
than
referring
the
bill
to
a
committee,
this
court
had
pointed
out,
does
not
indicate
the
congress
in
any
way
acquiesces
in
the
view
that
the
statute
as
presently
written
does
not
cover
the
practice
which
the
bill
was
designed
to
change.
the
court
of
appeals
also
placed
considerable
reliance
on
the
fact
that
these
provisions
have
the
captions,
exclusive
outlets
and
tied
house
which
it
read
as
limiting
the
proper
scope
of
the
provision
and
therefore
they
said
that,
since
the
tied
sale
is
neither
an
exclusive
outlet
or
a
near
exclusive
dealing
on
a
tied
house,
this
thing
does
not
come
within
the
statute.
well,
once
again,
we
recognize
that
the
headings
of
sections
are
of
course
entitled
to
weigh
and
construing
them.
on
the
other
hand,
the
exclusive
outlet
section
seems
to
be
merely
a
repetition
of
what
was
in
the
code.
these
particular
captions
were
not
the
subject
of
any
congressional
debated
and
we
think
they're
merely
a
shorthand
method
of
covering
what
is
the
general
subject
and
in
the
light
of
the
specific
language
in
here
providing
for
exclusion
in
whole
or
in
part,
we
don't
think
that
the
caption
can
fairly
be
read
as
limiting
the
particular
language.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so,
mr.
justice
brennan
too
because
it's
again
a
shorthand
method
for
indicating
the
kinds
of
practices
which
results
in
the
wholesaler
obtaining
control
over
the
retail
and
again
we
think
the
specific
reference
in
taking
a
quote
there
is
broad
enough
to
cover
this
contract.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it
does.
it's
a
phrase
that
grew
up
in
the
liquor
industry
and
is
specifically
referred
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
those
are
all
provisions
which
maybe
the
way
in
which
you
can
control
such
as
giving
signs,
such
as
obtaining
an
interest
in
the
license
and
interest
in
real
estate,
giving
very
successive
things
and
so
on
--
guaranteeing
loans
and
so
forth.
we
don't
claim
that
there
is
any
particular
provision,
which
would
not
be
covered
by
tied
house.
we
do
claim
that
tied
house
doesn't
limit
it
and
that
this
particular
type
of
practice
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
could
lead
to
a
tied
house
was
broadened
up
and
was
contemplated
by
congress
if
the
statute
is
broadly
grown.
my
opponent
will
undoubtedly
refer
in
considerable
detail
to
the
fact
that
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
passed,
the
tie
--
the
tie-in
sale
was
not
then
known
as
a
particularly
--
as
a
practice
engaged
in
by
the
alcoholic
beverage
industry.
the
reason
of
course
to
that
is
that
by
its
very
nature,
a
tie-in
sale
can
only
exist
in
the
time
of
scarcity.
the
only
time
you
can
get
sufficient
leverage
to
force
a
person
to
take
something
he
doesn't
want
is
when
you
have
scarce
commodity.
but
that
frankly,
we
don't
think
justifies
the
restrictive
construction
of
this
act
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
language
is
broad
and
we
think
the
legislative
history
does
show
a
broad
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
to
condemn
as
it
said,
practices
analogous
to
those
prohibited
in
the
antitrust
laws
and
to
strike
at
the
strengths
of
trade
and
monopolies
in
their
incipiency.
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
just
a
few
words
what
this
court
said
in
the
joiner
case
as
to
the
construction
to
be
given
to
statutes
which
provides
for
a
regulatory
pattern
even
though
the
violation
of
the
statute
may
also
be
a
crime
as
it's
true
in
this
case.
the
court
said
that
the
courts
will
interpret
the
text
so
far
as
the
meaning
of
the
words
fairly
permit
so
as
to
carry
out
in
particular
cases
the
generally
expressed
legislative
policy
and
we
believe
that
construing
this
language
is
broad
enough
to
cover
tie-in
sales
does
carry
out
that
general
legislative
policy.
i
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
most
of
mr.
steeg's
arguments,
seem
to
me
relate
to
questions
which
are
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
unnecessary
to
raise
such
as
the
substantiality
of
the
act
on
interstate
commerce
whether
in
fact
it
proves
a
sufficient
volumes
of
tie-in
sales
that
the
question
brought
to
this
court
by
the
government
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
question
is
to
which
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
circuits,
is
whether
this
statute
covers
tie-in
sales
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
we
think
from
the
statute
says
to
require
a
retailer
to
purchase
such
products,
and
such
person
to
the
exclusion
in
whole
or
in
part
of
distilled
spirits
sold
or
offered
for
sale
by
other
persons
in
interstate
commerce,
that
language
does
cover
tie-in
sale.
now,
one
thing
i
might
mention
on
the
interstate
commerce
point
is
that
the
examiner
did
find
that
the
competing
products,
many
of
which
was
said
to
have
been
actually
excluded
in
the
sense
that
retailers
have
purchased
on
a
tied
basis,
will
not
or
therefore
did
not
purchase
the
other
product
were
found
to
have
come
in
to
the
state
of
louisiana
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
examiner
found
there
is
no
registered
distillery
in
interstate
commerce.
and
one
final
point
that
mr.
steeg
made
that
he
seem
to
suggest
that
because
there
is
nothing
done
from
1946
to
1952,
the
administrative
agency
didn't
have
much
faith
in
its
interpretation.
well,
to
begin
with,
in
1946,
the
entire
industry
had
entered
into
a
consensus
stipulation.
secondly,
as
pretty
well
recognized,
tie-in
sales
become
a
serious
problem
only
in
times
of
scarcity
and
there
was
the
immediate
post
war
scarcity,
then
liquor
became
more
plentiful
and
it
was
only
in
the
advent
of
the
korean
emergency
that
the
scarcity
is
again
developing.
as
soon
as
that
happened,
there
was
this
case,
there
was
the
distilled
brands
case
and
there
was
a
third
case
referred
to
in
our
brief
which
we
settle
by
stipulation.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
administrative
interpretation
has
been
consisted
that
the
administration
has
never
conceded
any
doubt
on
its
part
as
to
the
correctness
of
this
instruction
and
that
this
self
administrative
interpretation
reinforced
us
and
serves
to
emphasize
the
correctness
of
the
basic
statutory
view
that
a
tie-in
sale
is
prohibited
because
it
excludes
in
part
distilled
spirit
sale
--
sold
or
offered
for
sale
by
other
persons.
thank
you.
