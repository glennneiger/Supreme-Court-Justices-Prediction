mr.
steeg
would
you
be
good
enough
to
take
us
explicitly
through
the
quotation
you
gave
on
page
10
of
your
brief.
the
exclusive
outlet
provision
and
just
in
reading
it,
state
why
that
does
not
cover
a
tie-in
sale.
just
take
it
step
by
step
to
require
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
there
was
an
agreement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
purchase
to
the
exclusion.
the
phrase
is
purchase
to
the
exclusion,
not
require
him
to
purchase.
purchase
to
the
exclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
record
says
on
that
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i'm
just
dealing
with
the
statutory
definition
as
an
entirety
and
we'd
like
to
know
why
it
doesn't
cover
a
tie-in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
whole
or
in
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
the
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
is
sold
or
offered
for
sale
by
other
persons
in
interstate
commerce
that
it
qualifies
the
immediate
preceding
clause.
you
don't
think
that's
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
controversy
in
this
case,
the
interstate
commerce
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
--
you
introduced
a
new
--
if
i
follow
you,
you've
just
introduced
i
think
a
new
component
namely
substantial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
--
is
that
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
this
court
has
held
almost
nothing
is
enough
to
constitute
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
is
that
mean
--
what
we've
held
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
awfully
little
as
substantial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
the
quantity
in
that
sense
mean
the
totality
of
interstate
commerce
within
that
industry
or
this
quantity
mean
in
relation
to
the
two
competitors
which?
