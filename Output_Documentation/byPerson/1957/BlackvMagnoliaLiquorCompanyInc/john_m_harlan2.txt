let
me
see
if
i
understand
you
on
that
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
a
narrow
concept
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
only
thing
that
the
second
circuit
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you
really
get
out
of
this
letter.
they
didn't
say
that
we're
going
to
try
to
get
away
with
this
although
we
think
it's
doubtful
ourselves,
they
said
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
sustain
what
they
regard
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
court,
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
i
don't
quite
see
what
list
you
get
out
of
this
letter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but
the
statute
does
say
substantially,
doesn't
it?
it's
quoted
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
really
don't
argue
this
in
your
brief,
if
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
a
little
confused.
what
you're
arguing
now
is
in
effect
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
show
a
violation
of
the
statute
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
assuming
the
statute
applies
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
we
are
doing
is
to
whether
the
statute
--
if
we
construe
this
--
we
think
it
should
be
construed.
