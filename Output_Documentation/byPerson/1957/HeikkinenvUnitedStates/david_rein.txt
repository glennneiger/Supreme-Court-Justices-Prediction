mr.
david
rein
court
please,
petitioner
here
was
convicted
on
both
counts
of
the
two-count
indictment
charging
a
violation
of
section
23
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
the
offenses
alleged
in
the
indictment
provided
under
statute
in
which
he
was
convicted
were
one,
a
willful
failure
to
depart;
and
two,
the
second
count,
a
willful
failure
to
make
a
timely
application
for
travel
documents
necessary
to
his
departure
from
the
country.
both
of
these
failures
were
alleged
to
have
occurred
during
the
six-month
period
following
an
order
of
deportation
entered
against
the
petitioner.
in
other
words
under
the
statute,
under
the
statute
the
crime
is
for
an
alien
against
whom
an
order
of
deportation
as
been
entered,
willfully
fails
to
depart
or
willfully
fails
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
as
i
say
the
petitioner
is
convicted
on
both
counts.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
five-year
of
prison
term
on
the
first
account,
and
imposition
of
sentence
on
the
second
count
was
differed
until
completion
of
the
sentence
on
count
one.
petitioner
is
a
67-year
old
alien,
a
native
of
finland.
he
was
ordered
to
be
deported
by
the
immigration
service
on
the
basis
of
a
finding
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
from
1922
to
1930
and
he
was
therefore
deportable
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
22
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
this
order
of
deportation
was
affirmed
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
on
april
9th
1952.
some
nine
or
ten
days
after
the
order
of
deportation
was
affirmed
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
the
petitioner
was
visited
by
a
representative
of
the
immigration
service,
mr.
maki.
the
purpose
of
this
visit
was
to
complete
a
service
form,
to
prepare
and
complete
a
service
form
headed
passport
data
for
alien
deportees.
this
was
the
form
regularly
utilized
by
the
service
to
obtain
the
personal
history
of
any
deportees
in
order
to
procure
in
accordance
with
its
usual
practice,
the
necessary
travel
documents
for
aliens.
mr.
maki
told
the
petitioner
that
the
form
would
be
used
by
the
government
for
that
purpose.
the
petitioner
fully
cooperated
with
mr.
maki.
he
gave
him
all
the
necessary
information
and
the
form
was
duly
forwarded
to
the
chicago
office
of
the
service
for
processing.
the
record
does
not
indicate
what
happened
to
that
form
subsequently.
the
government
introduced
no
evidence
on
the
point.
petitioner's
efforts
at
the
trial
to
discover
what
had
occurred
with
that
form
was
blocked
by
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
saying
it
was
completely
irrelevant
since
the
government
owed
the
petitioner,
in
the
trial
court's
language
owed
the
petitioner
no
duty
to
assist
him
in
affecting
his
departure.
on
april
30th
1952,
and
this
is
about
a
week
to
ten
days
after
the
visit
to
the
petitioner
by
mr.
maki,
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
duluth
service,
duluth
office
of
the
immigration
service
sent
a
form
letter
to
petitioner.
it
was
on
a
mimeograph
form
and
that
letter
is
set
out
in
full
at
page
8
to
9
of
our
brief
beginning,
“dear
sir,
an
order
of
which
you
have
been
notified
directing
your
deportation
on
the
following
grounds
has
been
entered.”
the
crucial
paragraph,
we'll
now
deal
with
that
letter,
we
have
italicized,
upright
italics
at
page
a
and
that
paragraph
reads
as
follows.
“arrangements
to
affect
your
deportation
pursuant
to
search
order
are
being
made
and
when
completed,
you
will
be
notified
when
and
where
to
present
yourself
for
deportation.”
mr.
david
rein
no,
the
original
form
merely
contained,
it
was
not
a
form
letter
sent
to
--
it
was
a
blank
--
mr.
david
rein
--
in
which
the
petitioner
--
all
the
information
on
the
form
was
filled
out
by
the
petitioner,
in
which
he
gave
his
name,
his
birthplace,
his
residence,
where
he
might
have
been
a
citizen
and
the
purpose
of
that,
sole
purpose
of
that
form
was
so
that
the
service
should
have
the
necessary
data
to
procure
travel
documents
for
him
to
be
deported.
the
petitioner
had
in
the
deportation
proceeding
indicated,
as
he
is
entitled
to
under
the
statute,
as
it
is
granted
the
right
on
the
statute,
the
choice
of
country
to
which
he
should
be
deported
as
finland,
his
native
country
and
this
form
is
to
get
the
necessary
information
so
that
the
immigration
service
can
go
to
finland
or
the
proper
authorities
in
finland
to
get
travel
documents
for
him
to
go
to
finland
and
he
did
not
keep
that
form,
that
form
was
then
taken
by
the
representative
of
service.
mr.
david
rein
well
it
normally
does
so
far
as
it
is
in
this
record
as
a
matter
of
fact,
within
the
service
that
is
usual
practice
to
take
the
labeling.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
the
only
testimony
on
this
court,
in
this
record,
the
testimony
given
by
the
same
mr.
maki
that
so
far
as
he
knew,
the
petitioner
could
not
have
gotten
a
passport
or
travel
documents
except
by
going
through
the
service.
he
did
not
know,
well,
let's
put
it
this
way,
the
question
was
asked
could
the
petitioner
have
gotten
travel
documents
on
his
own
and
he
said,
“i
do
not
know
if
that
would
have
been
possible.”
mr.
david
rein
just
something
that
seems
to
be
their
normal
practice,
i
can
say
that
under
the
statute
they
are
required
to
do
it
or
they
have
the
legal
obligation,
it
just
seems
to
be
their
normal
procedure,
procedure
which
--
that
people
get
deported.
as
i
understand
the
purpose
of
it
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
in
a
case
where
they
in
some
reason
or
rather
didn't
succeed
they
could
call
upon
the
petitioner
or
the
alien
to
do
whatever
might
be
necessary
to
pull
out
whatever
documents
might
be
necessary
or
to
assist
them
in
any
way.
i
don't
say
that
statute
puts
that
upon
the
service,
but
that
does
seems
to
be
the
normal
practice
at
least
far
as
appears
from
this
case
and
is,
that
is
my
notion.
now
perhaps
the
government
might
say
otherwise.
mr.
david
rein
no
questionnaires
was
not
excluded
i
am
sorry
--
mr.
david
rein
the
questionnaire
which
he
filled
out
is
in
evidence
and
that
indicated
that
the
choice
of
country
is
finland.
what
was
excluded
by
the
court,
was
what
was
--
information
as
to
what
the
service
did
with
that
questionnaire
and
that
form.
in
other
words,
we
know
that
he
filled
out
the
questionnaire,
mr.
maki
took
the
questionnaire.
it
was
sent
from
the
duluth
office
of
service
to
chicago,
and
then
we
have
a
blank
as
to
what
the
service
did
with
it,
whether
they
sent
it
on
to
finland,
the
finnish
embassy
or
didn't
or
just
what
happened,
i
mean
that
aspect
was
excluded,
but
the
actual
questionnaire
is
an
exhibit
in
evidence
i
think
it's
exhibit
number
nine.
mr.
david
rein
i
am
sorry.
mr.
david
rein
questionnaire?
mr.
david
rein
well,
it
was
excluded
by
the
fact
--
it
was
done
at
the
--
prior
to
the
trial,
a
motion
was
made,
for
the
documents
which
would
show
what
the
government
did
in
order
to
process
his
application
and
at
page
--
the
record
at
page
19,
that
motion
was
denied
by
the
court
on
the
ground,
you'll
find
the
colloquy
from
19
to
21
in
which
the
motion
was
made
at
pre-trial
to
get
the
correspondence
that
the
government
may
have
had
with
finland,
canada
or
any
other
country
on
the
basis
of
that
questionnaire
and
the
court
there
said,
that
it
would
not
permit
that
to
be
brought
into
evidence,
we
were
directed
to
be
produced
on
the
ground
and
i
think
it
is
set
out
on
page
19.
i
don't
care
what
correspondence
the
government
had
with
finland
or
canada
or
anywhere
else
for
the
records
to
his
deportation
after
that
order
was
entered.
they
owe
him
no
duty.
it
was
his
duty
to
obey
that
order.
that
is
all
to
this
and
that's
what
the
court's
view
point.
we
proceed
then
on
the
chronology
of
events
here,
this
letter
of
april
30th
which
i
have
read
the
italicized
paragraph
informing
the
petitioner
that
the
government
was
proceeding
to
make
arrangements
to
effect
his
deportation
and
that
he
will
then
be
notified
when
and
where
to
present
himself
for
deportation.
the
letter
then
set
out
the
text
of
section
23
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
and
concluded
at
page
9
with
a
paragraph,
“therefore
you
will
recognize
the
importance
of
making
every
effort
in
good
faith
to
obtain
passport
or
other
travel
documents
so
that
you
may
effect
your
departure
pursuant
to
the
said
order
of
deportation
within
the
time
prescribed
by
the
quotation
above
in
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.”
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
rein
no
i
am
sorry
i
mean
page
9
of
my
brief.
it
appears
in
the
record
at
74
to
75,
but
it
is
set
out
in
our
brief
this
particular
letter
at
page
8
to
9.
mr.
david
rein
there
was
an
evidence,
what
was
excluded,
if
i
may
make
that
clear,
is
what
the
government
did
with
that
form.
mr.
david
rein
the
record
does
not
show
what
the
counsel's
arguments
to
the
jury,
and
i
don't
know
what
--
what
arguments
were
made
to
the
jury.
i
don't
think
they
were
transcribed
at
all,
and
the
record
does
not
contain
the
jury
arguments.
i
would
indicate
as
i
get
to
later
that
under
the
instructions,
it
would
have
been
completely
irrelevant
as
far
as
the
court
seem
to
think.
petitioner
was
again
interviewed
by
representatives
of
the
service
on
february
12th
1953
at
which
time
he
gave
them
a
sworn
statement
that
was
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
record
and
it
is
set
out
or
the
pertinent
portions
of
them
were
set
out
in
full
at
our
brief
from
page
9
to
12.
the
gist
of
this
statement
was
the
petitioner's
acknowledgment
that
subsequent
to
the
interview,
which
he
had
with
mr.
maki
in
april
of
1952,
he
had
taken
no
steps
and
had
done
nothing
to
obtain
travel
documents.
he
gave
as
a
reason
for
this
failure
that
it
was
his
impression
as
a
result
of
his
interview
with
mr.
maki
in
april
that
the
government
was
taking
care
of
the
matter
and
that
if
the
government
wished
anything
further
from
him,
he
would
be
so
informed.
petitioner
had
in
fact
informed
his
counsel
of
his
interview
with
mr.
maki
and
he
had
been
advised
by
his
counsel
that
there
was
nothing
further
for
him
to
do
until
he
received
further
advice
from
the
immigration
authorities.
the
petitioner
at
this
time,
february
12,
again
stated
that
he
was
willing
to
cooperate,
do
anything
necessary
to
obtain
a
passport
and
depart
to
finland
and
he
would
do
anything
the
attorney
general
wished
him
to
do.
he
did
say
that
if
the
attorney
general
wished
him
to
depart
to
some
other
country,
he
would
wish
first
to
consult
with
this
attorney
before
stating
his
position.
even
at
this
late
date,
february
12th
after
this
interview
which,
on
which
the
government
so
heavily
relies
in
showing
a
failure
of
the
petitioner
to
carry
out
his
obligation,
the
question
as
to
what
the
service
wished
the
petitioner
to
do
is
left
up
in
the
air.
the
service
officials
still
did
not
indicate
to
the
petitioner
that
they
thought
he
was
delinquent
in
any
respect,
or
that
there
was
anything
that
they
thought
he
should
do
at
this
time.
now
this
really
in
substance
is
the
government's
case.
they
have
the
letter
of
april
30th,
they
have
his
sworn
statement
of
february
12th
1953.
they
have
one
other
item
of
evidence
and
that
consisted
of
the
testimony
of
mr.
maki
who
gave
his
version
of
the
april
interview
with
the
petitioner.
maki's
version
of
that
april
interview,
upon
which
the
petitioner
stated,
gave
him
the
impression
that
he
need
do
nothing,
in
all
important
respects
fully
corroborated
the
petitioner.
maki
said
he
didn't
recall
the
details
of
the
interview.
he
denied
when
asked
whether
he
had
specifically
instructed
petitioner
that
he
need
do
nothing
on
his
own
until
he
heard
from
the
service,
but
this
denial
of
course
in
no
way
conflicts
with
petitioner's
statement
because
petitioner
never
said
that
he
was
specifically
told
by
maki
that
he
need
to
do
nothing.
he
stated
only
that
that
was
impression
had
gained
as
a
result
of
the
interview
and
on
the
basis
of
maki's
testimony
even
if
we
don't
credit
the
petitioner
of
his
own
statement,
that
was
the
only
reasonable
impression
he
could
have
gotten.
maki
did
testify
that
he
informed
petitioner
that
the
purpose
of
the
interview
was
to
obtain
information
which
will
be
forwarded
to
the
chicago
office
so
that
it
might
take
the
necessary
steps
to
obtain
travel
documents.
maki
acknowledged
further
that
so
far
as
he
knew,
there
was
no
other
method
by
which
petitioner
acting
on
his
own
could
have
obtained
the
necessary
documents
and
there
was
no
question
under
any
version
of
the
interview
and
maki
himself
conceded
that
he
did
not
tell
petitioner
that
he
had
to
proceed
independently
of
the
service
to
obtain
travel
documents.
mr.
david
rein
well
they
had
two
other
witnesses
who
testified
to
really
nothing,
they
had
another
witness
who
testified,
the
officer
in
charge
identified
the
letter
of
april
30th
which
he
had
sent.
they
had
another
witness
who
is
the
one
who
took
the
interview,
the
sworn
statement,
a
mr.
bolden
who
took
the
sworn
statement
in
the
interview
of
february
12th
1953
which
was
then
introduced
in
evidence.
i
mean
there
were
two
other
witnesses
but
they
testified
to
nothing
of
any
consequence.
and
maki
was
the
only
government
official
who
spoke
to
the
petitioner
between
the
time
of
his
deportation
and
the
time
of
the
february
12th
1953
interview.
there
was
no
other
contact
between
him
and
the
service
except
for
the
letter
of
april
30,
which
was
sent
to
him.
in
other
words
there
was
no
other
conversation
between
the
petitioner
and
any
other
official
of
the
service
other
than
mr.
maki.
so
i
say
that
there
weren't
other
government
witness
to
identify
the
documents
so
that
this
really
is
the
government's
case.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct,
i
said
the
government
will
now
get
to
it,
government
did
not
prove
either
the
failure
to
apply
for
the
travel
documents
and
certainly
did
not
prove
whatever
failure
that
might
have
been
was
local.
your
honor
certainly
to
be
local
the
petitioner
must
have
had
some
knowledge
of
what
was
required
and
that
--
i
think
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
the
petitioner
then
only,
the
only
reasonable
thing
to
do,
he
took
the
government
at
its
word,
when
they
said
they
were
taking
care
of
the
matter,
when
they
sent
him
a
letter
saying
arrangements
to
effect
you
deportation
of
being
made
we
will
notify
you
when
and
where
to
report,
he
took
them
at
their
word
and
waited
to
hear
from
them.
mr.
david
rein
yes
there
was
a
motion
for
the
judgment
of
acquittal?
mr.
david
rein
no
he
did
not.
mr.
david
rein
that's
right.
there
is
no
evidence
presented
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
at
all.
he
did
not
take
the
stand
or
did
he
present
any
evidence
so
that's
the
government's
case,
a
complete
picture
to
conquest.
i
should
say
this
with
regard
to
mr.
maki's
testimony
and
one
real
item
that
the
government
attempts
to
make
something
out
it,
out
of.
mr.
maki
in
response
to
a
leading
question
said
that
he
did
not
make
any
statements
to
petitioner
that
would
give
petitioner
the
impression
that
he
should
wait
until
he
heard
from
the
service.
we
argue
that
that
does
not
help
the
government
at
all
because
this
was
simply
an
inadmissible
erroneous
opinion
characterization
of
the
clear
meaning
of
his
words.
the
impression
that
petitioner
could
or
would
have
gotten
from
his
interview
with
maki
should
be
gotten
from
what
mr.
maki
told
him,
not
from
mr.
maki's
characterization
of
what
he
told
him,
should
not
have
given
him
that
impression.
i'd
say
short
of
that
piece
of
evidence
the
government
has
nothing
to
indicate
that
--
mr.
david
rein
yes,
he
was
tried
for
a
jury.
to
change
our
argument
as
i
have
indicated
earlier
the
government,
the
petitioner
here
was
convicted
on
two
counts;
one
is
failure
to
depart
from
the
country,
two
a
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
however,
as
indicated
by
the
instructions
of
the
court
and
by
the
evidence
both
counts
rest
entirely
on
the
government's
position
that
there
was
a
failure
to
apply
to
travel
documents.
i
wanted
to
deal
with
it
later
with
the
fact
that
that
in
itself
was
an
invalid
position
but
i
want
to
address
myself
now
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
show
a
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
the
indictment
and
the
language
of
the
statute
charged
the
petitioner
failed,
“to
make
timely
application
in
good
faith
for
travel
or
other
documents
necessary
to
his
departure.”
the
statute
does
not
require
an
application
in
any
way
or
indicate
to
whom
the
application
must
be
made.
the
petitioner
here
did
in
fact
make
an
application
for
travel
documents
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
he
did
fill
out
this
passport
data
for
alien
deportees,
which
was
a
form
supplied
by
the
service
and
regularly
used
by
the
service
to
obtain
travel
documents
for
aliens
under
orders
of
deportation.
if
moreover
was
told
that
the
documents
would
be
used
for
that
purpose
and
the
evidence
in
this
record
as
indicated
by
mr.
maki's
testimony
shows
that
the
government
had
in
the
past
obtained
travel
documents
on
the
basis
of
just
such
a
form
and
indeed
as
i've
already
indicated,
mr.
maki
indicated
he
didn't
know
of
any
other
procedure
for
obtaining
travel
documents.
the
validity
of
this
particular
section
of
this
statute
was
before
this
court
in
spector,
at
which
time
this
court
sustained
that
provision
of
the
statute
against
the
charge
that
it
was
too
vague,
it
would
be
impossible.
but
as
i
read
spector,
we
read
spector,
it
did
it
only
on
the
ground
and
it
could
only
upon
the
ground
that
in
any
particular
case
the
passport
visa
requirements
of
a
particular
country
were
ascertainable,
and
that
evidence
would
be
shown
in
any
particular
case
as
to
what
was
required.
the
government
apparently
assumes
that
the
application
which
the
alien
here
made
to
the
service
was
not
a
proper
application
for
travel
documents,
it
was
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute,
but
there
is
no
evidence
here
to
support
such
an
assumption.
there
is
no
evidence
here,
the
government
introduced
no
evidence
to
show
what
would
have
been
a
proper
application
or
what
it
apparently
maintains
or
contends
that
the
petitioner
should
have
done
in
the
way
of
making
an
application
for
travel
documents.
thus
on
this
record,
petitioner
was
convicted
for
failing
to
take
some
undefined
action,
which
was
not
shown
to
be
the
necessary,
useful
or
appropriate
for
the
obtaining
of
travel
documents,
but
he
did
apply
for
travel
documents
which
was
the
normal
channel
for
such
application
through
the
service,
and
although
it
does
not
appear
that
any
other
application
was
needed
or
would
have
even
been
useful.
in
spector,
which
i
have
indicated
earlier,
the
court
sustained
this
provision
of
the
statute
against
the
charge
of
vagueness,
the
court
said,
the
statute
might
well
be
a
trap,
if
for
example
if
required
the
alien
to
know
the
visa
requirements
for
one
or
more
countries.
i
would
say
that
the
government's
view
of
the
statute,
which
it
takes
here
and
which
says
that
petitioner
could
be
guilty
of
a
crime
without
defining
exactly
what
it
was
he
failed
to
do,
would
so
convert
the
statute
into
a
trap.
mr.
david
rein
the
passport
form?
i
have
a
record
reference
to
127.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
know
if
it's
printed
there
or
if
it's
just
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
the
exhibit
is
not
actually
printed
in
the
record,
but
here
in
the
office
it's
part
of
the
record
here
and
it's
been
furnished
to
the
court.
the
government
does
concede,
i
wish
now
to
turn
to
what
the
government
does
concede
is
a
necessary
element
in
this
crime,
but
even
if
there
was
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
apply
for
travel
documents
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
that
as
i
say
under
the
government's
concession,
the
petitioner
would
not
be
guilty
unless
that
failure
was
a
willful
failure.
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
prove
that
the
petitioner's
failure
to
take
action
was
in-spite
of
his
knowledge
of
what
was
required
of
him
and
with
the
intent
of
completing
his
obligation
under
the
statute.
in
other
words,
because
of
the
presence
of
the
word
willful
in
the
statute,
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
morris
act
we
have
to
prove
not
only
his
failure
to
do
something,
but
we
have
to
prove
his
criminal
intent.
now
the
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
willfulness
in
this
case,
is
not
only
total
lacking,
but
on
the
contrary
all
of
the
evidence
that
there
is
here
shows
not
only
that
the
government
did
not
prove
willfulness,
but
it
completely
negates
any
possibility
of
willfulness.
first
there
was
petitioner's
statement
which
was
introduced
by
the
government.
now
that
clearly
negates
willfulness.
he
explained
his
failure
to
take
any
action
by
the
impression
he
obtained
from
the
interview
with
maki,
that
he
need
do
nothing
until
he
heard
from
the
service.
he
indicated
he
checked
with
his
counsel.
his
counsel
told
him
that
he
need
do
nothing
until
he
heard
from
the
service.
the
government
concedes
that
if
that
statement
is
taken
on
its
face,
that
it
does
establish
the
petitioner's
innocence.
in
other
words
if
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
petitioner
there
were
true,
that
was
indeed
his
honest
impression,
the
government
concedes
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
must
have
been
entered.
it
argues
however,
that
the
jury
could
have
disbelieved
the
petitioner's
assertion
of
good
faith
on
the
basis
of
other
evidence
in
the
record,
but
as
i
have
indicated
earlier
in
my
statement
in
that
case,
there
is
no
other
evidence
that
conflicts
with
petitioner's
assertion
of
good
faith.
on
the
contrary
all
of
the
other
evidence
corroborates
it.
now
i'll
go
so
far
as
to
say
quite
apart
from
the
petitioner's
statement,
as
to
why
he
took
no
action
because
he
was
relying
on
mr.
maki,
but
even
the
evidence
aside
from
that
proves
his
good
faith
and
what
is
this
evidence?
one,
there
is
maki's
version
of
the
interview
with
petitioner.
i've
already
gone
over
that
to
show
that
it's
fully
collaborating
the
petitioner
and
he
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
use
this
form,
it
was
going
to
be
sent
to
chicago,
and
he
did
not
say
to
him
that
he
need
do
anything
on
his
own;
secondly,
the
letter
of
april
3rd.
now
the
government
makes
the
point
in
that
letter,
in
which
it
says
that,
sure
they
did
have
this
paragraph
which
i
have
italicized,
in
which
it
said
arrangements
to
effect
your
deportation
are
being
made
and
we
will
let
you
know
when
and
where
to
present
yourself
for
deportation.
but
says
the
government,
the
letter
then
did
go
on
to
set
out
the
text
of
the
statute
and
presumably
according
to
the
government,
the
petitioner
should
have
read
the
text
of
the
statute
as
nullifying
the
flat
statement
of
the
government,
saying
that
they
were
taking
care
of
the
matter
and
they
would
let
him
know
when
they
wished
him
to
do
something.
now
i
submit
the
text
of
the
statute
does
not
indicate
to
me,
does
not
indicate
to
this
court
in
spector
and
cannot
possibly
indicate
to
anyone,
that
there
is
a
requirement,
an
unequivocal
plain
requirement
on
the
petitioner
to
do
something
independently
of
his
own.
if
they
had
sent
him
the
text
of
the
statute
alone
it
would
not
have
given
him
that
notice,
but
to
argue
as
the
government
does
that
he
should
read
from
the
text
of
that
statute,
that
nullification
as
clear
language
by
the
government,
that
they
were
taking
care
of
the
matter
and
he
could
wait
until
he
heard
from
them,
i
say
is
simple
nonsense.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof
(inaudible),
even
if
we
wind
up
with
the
conclusion
that
there
was
an
ambiguity
or
confusion,
then
the
petitioner
here
was
innocent,
because
even
if
he
failed
to
do
something
because
he
was
confused,
he
is
entitled
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
david
rein
it's
mimeograph
form,
yes,
presumably
sent
to
all
aliens
in
a
similar
position
as
the
petitioner.
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
prove
willfulness,
the
government
relies
on
the
curios
argument
that
the
petitioner
was
mature
and
literate
man
and
should
not
have
misunderstood
the
service.
but
as
i
have
indicated,
i
think
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
there
really
was
no
misunderstanding.
he
did
what
the
service
asked
him
to
do,
he
gave
the
information,
he
took
the
service
at
their
word.
the
real
confusion
if
there
is
any
in
this
case,
is
exactly
what
it
was
that
the
service
was
up
to
and
why
they
not
follow
out
the
usual
procedure,
why
they
didn't
process
the
documents
and
why
after
having
mislead
the
petitioner
in
believing
that
he
could
rely
up
on
their
records
to
obtain
travel
documents,
they
then
pounced
up
on
him
and
brought
this
indictment.
now
in
its
--
mr.
david
rein
all
i
know
(inaudible)
one
of
them
to
my
knowledge,
that's
all
i
know
of.
mr.
david
rein
it
was
not
in
appeal.
mr.
david
rein
that's
all
i
know
of
your
honor.
there
was
an
indictment
in
spector
which
came
up
before
this
court,
but
the
government
has
never
proceeded
to
take
that
case
to
trail,
even
after
this
court
sustained
the
indictment
that
we've
gone
through.
i've
heard
of
one
other
prosecution
which
was
not
appealed,
so
far
as
i
know
this
has
been
the
only
other
case
under
this
statute.
mr.
david
rein
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
there
when
they
went
to
see
him
in
april,
he
was
there
when
they
went
to
see
him
on
february
12,
1953
and
he
has
been
readily
available
at
all
times.
no
contention.
i
do
want
to
deal
with
one
aspect
of
this
case,
which
the
government
i
think
tries
to
rely
on
in
appeal
although
at
the
trial,
no
emphasis
was
placed
upon
it
all.
the
petitioner,
although
a
native
of
finland,
had
been
a
citizen
of
canada
before
he
came
to
the
united
states
and
there
was
some
question
at
the
time
as
to
whether
or
not
he
might
be
able
to
go
into
canada.
now
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
the
statute
gives
him
an
absolute
statutory
right
to
pick
the
country
of
his
choice
and
under
the
statute
he
must
be
deported
to
that
country
unless
and
until
that
country
refuses
to
accept
him,
and
there
was
no
refusal
here
by
finland
to
accept
him.
the
government
attempts
in
its
brief
to
say
that
in
any
event
the
petitioner
could
have
gone
to
canada
during
this
period.
now
obviously
this
makes
no
sense
because
he
would
have
needed
travel
document
to
go
to
canada,
the
same
way
he
needed
to
go
to
finland.
it's
indicated
by
the
opinion
in
spector,
the
statute
when
it
says
to
depart
from
the
country
means
to
lawfully
depart
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
of
this
country
and
the
other
country,
and
you
would
have
had
the
same
problem
if
he
was
still
waiting
to
hear
from
the
service.
mr.
david
rein
of
the
statute
in
question,
parole,
supervisory
parole,
yes
he
was.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
don't
know.
i'm
just
saying
that
speculating
as
to
the
fact
that
this
apparently
was
the
citizen
of
canada,
he
could
have
gone
to
canada,
but
he
couldn't
go
to
canada
anymore
than
he
could
go
to
finland
until
he
had
the
permission
of
canada
to
enter,
and
so
he
could
not
go
into
canada.
he
would
be
in
the
same
position
vis-à-vis
canada
as
he
was
in
finland,
but
he
was
waiting
to
hear
from
the
service
as
to
what
further
he
should
do.
i
make
the
added
point
that
he
could
not
be
compelled
to
go
to
canada
under
this
statute
unless
finland
had
first
turned
him
down
and
finland
had
not
turned
him
down.
one
other
aspect
of
this
deals
with
the
instructions
of
this
case.
even
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
government
did
prove
a
case
on
the
failure
to
apply
for
documents
and
did
prove
the
case
on
willfulness,
certainly
the
instructions
which
the
court
gave
the
jury
here
were
totally
inadequate
to
support
any
conviction.
the
government
concedes
that
the
factual
issue
for
the
jury
to
decide
was
whether
the
petitioner's
failure
to
take
any
action
subsequent
to
his
interview
with
mr.
maki
was
due
to
his
honest
belief
that
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
the
government,
but
whether
the
failure
was
done
with
the
knowledge
by
the
petitioner
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
some
independent
action
and
in
total
disregard
of
that
obligation.
now
that
could
have
been
the
only
real
factual
issue
present
to
the
jury,
but
the
jury
was
never
informed
in
any
manner,
shape
or
form
that,
that
was
the
issue
before
it.
consequently
--
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
know
that
a
specific
exception
was
taken
to
that
charge.
other
instructions
were
given
which
were
rejected,
but
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
that
under
that
decisions
of
this
court,
where
there
is
a
conviction
in
which
a
charge
is
so
completely
inadequate
to
define
guilt
or
innocence
in
all,
this
court
has
held
that
that's
reversible
error.
mr.
david
rein
well,
it
should
plain
error,
but
it's
so
clearly
error
where
the
jury
is
given
absolutely
no
guide
and
is
not
even
informed
of
the
nature
of
the
crime,
but
i
think
this
failure
in
the
instructions
in
this
particular
case
falls
in
that
type
of
a
category.
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
eliminated
by
its
instruction
the
requirement
to
(inaudible)
and
that
he
did
affirmatively,
not
negatively.
we
have
set
out
briefly
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
seven,
some
of
the
language
used
by
this
court,
some
of
these
leading
questions
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
willful
in
the
statute
and
what
it
means
in
terms
of
criminal
intent.
the
leading
case
on
that
is
felton
against
united
states
in
which
this
court
said
that
doing
or
omitting
to
do
a
thing
knowingly
and
wilfully
implies
not
only
a
knowledge
of
the
trend,
but
it's
determination
with
a
bad
intent
do
it
or
omit
to
do
it.
now
this
is
what
the
court
told
the
jury.
mr.
david
rein
(inaudible)
certainly
with
the
word
willful
is
broad
in
the
statute.
i
think
it's
been
definitely
followed
by
this
court
--
mr.
david
rein
courts
consistently
adhere
to
the
rule.
mr.
david
rein
what
is
the
language?
mr.
david
rein
with
a
bad
intent
to
do
it
or
omit
to
do
it.
perhaps
the
court
has
used
some
other
phraseology
--
mr.
david
rein
but
this
court
has
been
generalization.
mr.
david
rein
in
cases
which
i
have
set
forth,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
it
is
not.
mr.
david
rein
well,
in
any
event,
let's
look
at
what
the
court
did
tell
the
jury
here.
he
told
them,
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
32
of
my
brief,
he
told
them
that
the
petitioner
can't
remain
idle.
he
must
take
the
necessary
steps
to
affect
his
departure
from
this
country
within
that
period
of
six
months
and
if
he
fails
to
do
so,
he
has
violated
the
law
and
the
statute
involved
in
this
case.
he
has
also
told
them
that
wrongful
acts
knowingly
or
intentionally
committed
can
be
neither
justified
nor
excused
on
the
ground
of
innocent
intent.
mr.
david
rein
well,
it
indicates
--
i
think
the
clear
meaning
of
that
is
in
this
context,
in
this
case,
particularly
in
view
of
the
instructions
given
by
the
court
to
the
jury,
for
further
instruction,
and
it
was
not
the
government's
duty
to
deport
the
witness,
the
petitioner,
but
his
own
duty,
and
once
he
has
failed
in
that
duty,
and
he
was
no
longer
--
had
not
departed
from
the
country,
he
was
guilty
regardless
of
the
circumstance
and
regardless
of
his
intent.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
say
it
was
clear.
imagine
that
even
though
the
jury
found
that
he
had
failed
to
take
action,
because
he
honestly
relied
upon
his
belief
that
the
government
was
taking
care
of
the
matter
he
was
still
guilty,
that
is
the
clear
import,
that
instruction
and
the
top
of
instructions
given
by
the
court
to
that
jury.
i
say
it
was
unambiguous
in
that
respect,
perhaps
if
there
had
been
some
confusion
the
jury
might
have
acquitted.
but
in
effect
–
mr.
david
rein
well
this
far
worse
when
it
is
very,
very
clear
that
on
a
set
of
facts,
which
would
warrant
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
the
jury
is
told
you
should
convict
on
that
set
of
facts.
i
think
that's
even
far
more
or
far
worse
than
an
ambiguous
construction.
i
wish
now
to
turn
to
one
another
point
before
i
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
in
the
remaining
time
left,
and
that
is
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
both
of
a
failure
to
depart
and
a
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
that
on
evidence
and
on
instructions
by
the
court,
that
the
gist
of
the
failure
to
depart
offence
consistent
of
his
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
mr.
david
rein
sure.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
yes
i
am.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
well
no,
i
am
saying
that
it's
an
incorrect
charge.
i
say
that
it
makes
no
difference
as
a
matter
of
law
here
and
i'm
not
pressing
the
point
as
to
whether
the
duty
is
on
the
government
or
on
petitioner?
i
say
it's
an
incorrect
charge
to
give
the
jury
in
this
particular
case
where
the
issue
is
whether
he
has
willfully
failed.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
i
am
making
the
appointment
that
there
is
--
the
charge,
that
there
is
an
absolute
duty
upon
him
and
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
government
or
the
government
office
assistance
is
an
incorrect
statement.
mr.
david
rein
i
am
making
no
point
to
the
sufficiency
of
that,
independent
as
the
appellant
relates
on
the
question
of
willfulness.
as
i
say
under
the
instructions
and
under
the
evidence,
he
was
convicted
of
the
offense
of
failure
to
depart
solely
upon
evidence,
which
approved
anything.
it
only
proved
a
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
we
contend
that
these
two
crimes
are
not
identical
and
that
one
cannot
be
convicted
of
a
failure
to
depart
where
that
value
is
due
solely
and
entirely
to
a
failure
to
apply
to
travel
documents.
now
the
government
tries
to
turn
our
contention
around
their
brief
to
say
that
we
are
arguing
that
an
individual
cannot
be
guilty
of
both
offenses
in
the
same
prosecution.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
that
is
not
our
contention,
but
we
say
that
since
the
crimes
are
not
identical,
one
cannot
make
out
a
failure
to
depart
solely
by
showing
a
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
one
must
also
show
something
in
addition
and
that
may
be
either
that
despite
his
failure
to
apply
to
travel
documents,
travel
documents
were
obtained
and
he
still
failed
to
depart,
or
that
one
reason
or
another
he
could
have
departed
without
obtaining
any
travel
documents.
both
those
elements
are
absent
in
this
case.
as
we
show
in
our
brief
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that
he
would
have
gone?
mr.
david
rein
he
could
have
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
the
government
presented
no
claim
--
mr.
david
rein
i
say
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
he
would
actually
have
to
have
--
before
the
crime
of
failure
to
depart
came
about,
he
would
actually
have
to
have
travel
documents.
now
that
principle
of
not
multiplying
offenses
making
two
offenses,
two
crimes
out
of
one
offense,
there
is
a
line
with
the
canons
of
interpretation
which
this
court
has
set
out.
we
have
set
them
out
briefly
on
page
25
to
27.
i
think
that
i
don't
want
to
go
into
it
any
greater
detail
here
and
i
think
it's
fully
and
adequately
covered
in
our
brief,
the
general
principle
and
we
have
a
number
of
grounds
to
that
general
principle
as
to
why
we
do
not
normally
make
two
offenses
out
of
one.
and
in
addition
to
that,
it
seems
to
me
the
government's
position
would
conflict
with
the
fifth
amendment's
probation
against
double
jeopardy.
on
this
particular
point
in
issue
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
indicate
the
congressional
intent
and
that
is
contrary
to
the
government's
assertion.
the
government
in
their
brief
cite
some
legislative
history
which
they
say
indicates
that
congress
desired
to
make
two
offenses
out
of
the
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
we
wish
to
comment
only
that
the
legislative
history
which
they
cite
is
not
upon
the
statute
which
was
passed
but
upon
some
previous
proposals
which
were
rejected
by
congress
and
which
had
no
reference
whatsoever
the
question
out
of
crime
by
virtue
of
a
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
we
submit
therefore
that
in
the
absence
of
any
legislative
history
illuminating
of
any
kind
or
character
the
court
should
follow
its
usual
canons
of
interpretation
and
limit
the
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents
evidenced
to
failure
to
apply
for
travel
documents
as
being
evidenced
only
of
that
offense
and
not
of
the
offense
of
failure
to
depart
and
under
that
construction,
certainly
that
--
there
would
be
no
proof
of
a
failure
to
depart
in
any
event.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
he
was
sentenced
on
the
failure
to
depart.
that
would
mean
necessary
to
reverse
because
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
david
rein
well
except
your
honor
i
would
say
that
the
case
does
come
to
posture
in
which
there
is
a
finding
of
guilty
on
the
other
count
and
if
there
is,
as
we
contend
quickly
insufficient
evidence
to
show
a
--
to
support
the
conviction
on
the
other
count
i
do
think
that
it
would
not
be
helpful
at
this
stage
to
send
it
back
for
a
possible
sentence
on
that
count
and
let
it
come
all
the
way
back
up
here.
mr.
david
rein
oh
yes.
mr.
david
rein
well
i
thought
you
weren't
--
yes
if
all
the
other
points
were
filed
against
this,
he
would
still
be
entitled
to
reversal
on
that
point
alone,
and
re-sentence
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
there
has
been
no
sentence
at
all.
the
court
deferred
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
until
completion
of
the
sentence.
mr.
david
rein
yes
there
is
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
i
think
under
the
(inaudible)
case
that
is
before
your
honors
to
review
even
though
no
sentencing
was
reversed.
i
think
it
was
(inaudible)
and
i
think
this
court
cited
on
that.
turning
to
how
--
my
remaining
time
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
the
deportation
order
on
which
this
proceeding
is
based
was
issued
against
the
petitioner
as
a
result
of
an
administrative
proceeding
before
the
service.
in
the
first
trial,
i
should
indicate
at
this
stage
your
honor
that
this
conviction
which
is
coming
up
here
as
a
result
of
a
second
trial
on
this
indictment,
the
first
trial
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
because
the
validity
of
that
deportation
order
was
not
considered
at
all
in
the
trial.
in
the
second
trial
in
which
our
present
appeal
was
taken
the
trial
judge
reviewed
the
record
of
the
deportation
procedure.
he
made
a
finding
on
the
basis
of
his
review
of
the
record
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
the
immigration
officials
and
that
the
deportation
order
was
valid.
he
ruled,
however,
that
the
validity
of
the
order
or
of
the
facts
underlined
--
underlying
facts
justifying
the
order
was
not
a
jury
issue
and
that
would
not
be
determined
by
the
jury.
we
contend
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
as
applied.
we
relied
principally
for
this
argument
on
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
jackson
in
the
spector
case
and
on
his
reasoning
there.
i
should
note
although
i
call
it
a
dissent,
it
is
not
a
dissent
from
majority
views
in
that
case
because
the
majority
in
that
case
said
with
regard
to
the
aspect
of
the
case
covered
by
justice
jackson's
opinion,
the
case
did
not
reach
the
issue
since
it
had
not
been
briefed
and
argued
before
them
and
they
were
not
going
to
consider
it.
so
the
view
point
is
presented
although
a
dissent,
majority
has
not
spoken
upon
the
matter.
it
was
left
open
specifically
in
spector
--
it
was
stated
to
be
an
open
question
for
consideration
by
this
court
at
an
appropriate
time.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct,
whether
the
statute
was
valid
on
its
face
because
as
justice
jackson
put
it,
the
statute
in
effect
split
up
two
elements
of
the
crime,
that
there
were
two
essential
elements
of
the
crime;
one
was
the
deportability
of
the
alien
and
the
second
the
willful
failure
to
leave
the
country
or
to
apply
for
travel
documents.
and
that
the
first
of
these
elements
was
submitted
to
an
administrative
proceeding,
thus
avoiding
the
constitutional
guarantees
for
the
trial
of
this
portion
of
the
crime.
we
have
set
out,
and
i
want
to
make
only
very
brief
reference
to
it,
the
number
of
constitutional
guarantees
which
would
be
available
in
a
criminal
trial,
which
is
denied
in
an
administrative
proceeding
on
a
deportation.
they
are
briefly
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
the
right
not
to
be
prosecuted
against
except
by
indictment,
the
right
against
double
jeopardy,
the
right
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
confronted
with
witnesses,
the
right
in
accused
failure
to
testify
is
not
evidence
of
guilt
guarantee
by
the
fifth
amendment,
the
right
not
to
be
tried
by
your
accuser,
and
that
your
guilt
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now
all
of
these
elements
are
not
present
in
an
administrative
proceeding.
the
government
latches
on
to
one
phrase
in
justice
jackson's
opinion.
mr.
jackson
and
at
time
of
the
spector
case
had
said
in
his
opinion
that
the
deportation
order
would
be
conclusive
in
the
trial
proceedings.
the
government
says
that
therefore
apparently
justice
jackson's
objection
was
met,
because
here,
the
validity
was
not
conclusive
because
the
trial
court
made
an
independent
review.
we
submit
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
justice
jackson's
reading
of
the
statute
is
probably
the
correct
one.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
justified
what
the
trial
court
did
here
in
making
its
own
independent
review,
because
the
statute
only
refers
to
an
outstanding
deportation
order.
but
even
assuming
that
the
statute
can
be
so
interpreted
in
order
to
save
constitutionality,
it
does
not
meet
the
real
basis
of
the
objections
made
in
the
spector
case,
because
even
if
the
matter
is
reviewed
by
the
court,
we
still
have
the
problem
as
put
by
justice
jackson,
the
adjudication
that
an
alien
has
been
guilty
of
conduct
subjecting
him
to
deportation
is
not
made
by
procedures
constitutional
or
judgment
of
crime.
and
even
where
there
is
review
all
that
the
judge
reviews
is
that
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
it,
that
there
has
not
been
a
violation
of
some
regulation.
it
does
not,
therefore
substitute
or
give
him
the
right
that
you
would
have
in
a
criminal
case
of
trial
by
jury.
mr.
david
rein
yes
--
mr.
david
rein
it's
made
only
in
respect
to
the
statute.
mr.
david
rein
it's
perfectly
(inaudible).
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
just
the
point
made
in
the
dissent
of
justice
jackson's
opinion,
that
all
of
this
procedure
and
this
lack
of
procedure
and
differences
between
the
administrative
procedure
and
the
criminal
procedure,
that
we
have
sustained
that,
speaking
of
the
court
throughout
its
history
has
sustained
that
in
deportation
procedures,
on
the
government's
continued
insistence
that
a
deportation
proceeding
is
a
purely
civil
matter,
with
absolutely
no
criminal
consequences,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
you
have
sustained
it
and
sustained
the
validity
of
that
procedure
to
support
a
deportation
order.
but
when
that
deportation
order
is
made
to
carry
consequences,
as
it
is
here,
resulting
in
an
imprisonment
of
five
years,
then
that
procedure
falls
because
the
deportation
order
is
now
not
purely
civil
in
its
aspect,
but
its
criminal,
because
of
the
factors
being
employed
criminal,
no
tax
is
being
made
on
validity
audit
as
an
order,
standing
by
itself.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
that
would
be
the
only
way
to
sustain
it
as
constitutional.
mr.
david
rein
you've
joined
in
the
opinion
your
honor.
mr.
david
rein
i
can
only
say
your
honor
that
i'm
delinquent
in
that
respect,
i'm
not
aware
of
the
cases
and
i
didn't
want
to
rely
on
it.
mr.
david
rein
well
that
in
the
remaining
time
and
if
the
court
pleases,
in
the
light
of
justice
frankfurter's
suggestion
if
the
court
wishes,
i'll
be
glad
to
examine
those
cases.
mr.
david
rein
we
discussed
cox
and
yakus,
yes
and
i
would
like
to
ask
in
view
of
justice
frankfurter's
comments
and
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
file
a
brief
memorandum
on
the
significance
of
the
cases
decided
by
justice
frankfurter
if
i
may?
mr.
david
rein
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
david
rein
the
distinction
made,
if
i
may
turn
to
question
of
the
yakus
case,
or
between
this
case
and
the
yakus
case,
is
that
the
yakus
case
was
an
administrative
regulatory
procedure
setting
out
standards
of
conduct
to
guide
people
in
the
future,
in
contrast
to
the
nature
of
a
deportation
order
which
is
an
adjudication
of
guilt
in
a
particular
case
against
a
particular
individual,
and
it
is
not
a
general
regulatory
matter.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
significant,
i
think
this
point
should
be
made
clear,
that
this
statute,
that
is
this
self
deportation
statute
does
not
apply
to
any
order
of
the
deportation,
it
applies
only
to
orders
of
deportation
based
upon
certain
grounds,
and
those
grounds
are
grounds
which
apparently
the
congress
had
some
guilt
attached
to
that,
because
they
referred
to
some
persons,
criminals.
this
particular
alien
here
was
ordered
deported
on
two
grounds,
one
his
entry
into
this
country
without
a
visa
as
well
as
his
past
membership
in
a
communist
party.
the
order
of
deportation
so
far
as
it
rests
on
the
first
ground
would
not
be
a
basis
for
application
of
the
statute
here.
so
that
the
very
conduct
of
deportation,
this
very
cause
underlying
the
deportation
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
crime
in
this
particular
case,
and
it's
because
of
that
the
procedure
adopted
here
of
eliminating
that
portion
of
the
crime,
in
the
consideration
of
the
jury
runs
into
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
david
rein
we
argue
that
the
cox
case,
really
in
this
respect
can
prove
and
prove
on
my
brief
at
all,
the
cox
case
is
unlike
yakus,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
a
general
regulatory
procedure.
but
that
case
we
say
where
you
have
an
administrative
classification
for
draft
purposes
is
very
different
from
a
determination
that
an
individual
is
guilty
of
some
past
misconduct.
you
had
in
cox,
an
application
by
an
individual
to
be
exempt
from
a
rule
that
applies
in
general
to
all
people,
and
the
determination
made
there
by
the
selective
service
boards
is
not
a
finding
of
guilt,
but
simply
that
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
an
exceptional
privilege,
and
we
here
say
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
whole
procedure
which
is
employed
in
the
cox
statute,
seem
to
indicate
by
this
court's
opinion
also
in
the
nugent
case
show
that
was
a
type
of
procedure
in
which
this
court
thought
because
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
that
the
individual
was
entitled
to
very
low
in
the
nature
of
due
process
and
as
i
said,
that
also
underlie
the
aspect
of
the
nugent
case.
i
would
say
that
cox
a
very
special
case
limited
it
to
the
fact
that
here
is
an
individual
who
is
asking
for
a
special
privilege
from
an
obligation
imposed
upon
all
citizens
in
the
service,
is
not
the
same
that's
involved
in
this
type
of
case
where
there
is
finding
of
guilt.
i
would
like
to
indicate
just
one
other
portion
of
argument
on
constitutionality
dealing
with
the
nature
of
the
cause
for
deportation
that
that
is
covered
in
our
brief,
my
time
has
expired.
