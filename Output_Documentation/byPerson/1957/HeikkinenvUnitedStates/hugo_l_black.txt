justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
record
where
do
we
find
that
question
that
you
referred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
excluded
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
proof
here
on
which
the
court
could
have
found
that
had
he
applied,
he
would
have
bound
to
go?
i
understand
you
say
that
they
mount
on
the
fact
that
he
didn't
apply
the
travel
document
that
he
willfully
refused
to
depart.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
proof
here
or
anything
which
it
did
infer
that
if
he
had
applied,
it
was
inevitable
that
he
would
have
gone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
could
have
gone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
offer
any
proof
to
show
that
he
could
have
got,
that
he
could
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
claim
they
had
enough
evidence
to
show
maybe
that
he
didn't
apply,
that
he
didn't
apply
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
that
it's
not
enough
to
show
that
he
willfully
failed
to
depart.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
your
arguing
that
attempt
to
filing
would
not
merely
be
an
application
but
again
it
is
sort
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
failure
to
concern.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
try
to
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
immigration
authority.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
there
was
an
effort
made
to
get
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
an
effort
made
shown
by
the
record
to
prove
what
the
government
did
in
connection
with
trying
to
get
this
man
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
effort
made
to
get
any
evidence
to
show
what
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
impertinent
to
the
enquiry
if
the
government
trial
couldn't
get
it,
how
could
a
jury
find
that
he
could
have
done
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
imagine
a
lot
of
district
judges
in
the
united
states
couldn't
get
them.
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
this
man
is
convicted
of
willful
failing
to
depart.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
by
some
evidence
--
i
suppose
that
would
require
some
evidence
to
show
he
could
depart
and
didn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
convicted
for
willfully
refusing
to
go
to
finland
or
willfully
refusing
to
go
to
canada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
he
convicted
for
willfully
doing
nothing
about
going
to
going
to
canada
or
finland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that
the
government
if
it
has
to
give
a
bill
of
particulars
would
have
been
required
to
say
whether
he
has
failed
--
refused
to
go
to
finland
or
canada,
which
did
he
refuse,
which
was
he
convicted
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
still
here
and
that
hasn't
gone
and
therefore
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
would
require
would
it
not,
that
the
government
proves
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
failed
go
to
go
to
finland
or
canada
or
both,
when
he
could
have
done
so
in
order
to
convict
him
of
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
claim
that
they
have
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
he
could
have
gone
to
finland
or
canada
and
didn't
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
pick
you
third
element
that
he
could
have
gone
had
he
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
either
anywhere.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
then
rely
on
the
canadian
instead
of
the
finland.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
your
evidence
that
he
could
have
gone
to
finland
had
he
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
he
convicted
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
failing,
refusing
to
go
when
he
could
have
gone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
your
evidence
that
he
could
have
gone
to
finland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
convict
a
man,
give
him
ten
years
in
a
penitentiary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
refusing
to
go
to
a
place
without
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
could
have
gone
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
have
very
easily
proved
if
you
were
making
the
effort
to
get
it
and
you
could
have
shown
that
he
could
go
to
finland.
you
could
have
had
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
he
could
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
crime
you
convicted
him
of
there
is
refusal
to
go,
failure,
willful
failure
and
refusal
to
go
which
has
to
embrace
that,
the
fact
that
he
could
have
gone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
on
the
government
or
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
on
the
government,
it
is
the
government's
burden
to
prove
that
he
is
guilty
or
his
burden
to
prove
that
he
is
innocent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
your
argument
with
reference
to
a
charge
of
a
crime
that
a
man
had
to
file
the
papers,
he
didn't
apply,
but
i
do
not
understand
your
argument
as
made
in
connection
with
the
criminal
charge
that
he
could
have
gone,
he
willfully
failed
and
refused
to
go
to
a
country,
i
do
not
understand
how
you
say
that
the
government
is
free
from
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
could
have
gone
there.
how
could
he
have
wilfully
failed
to
do
so?
