justice

do
you
think
that's
the
universal
rule,
do
you
in
criminal
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
this
that
last
phrase
what
intent?
evil
what
is
it
all
that
moralistic
language?
justice
felix
frankfurter
consistent
is
a
big
word
in
this
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
this
last
phrase?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
relates
--
it
varies
with
statutes.
i
think
the
one
generalization
you
can
make
is
that
you
can't
make
a
generalization
about
this
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
swear
that
to
being
the
big
generalization
and
eat
him
away.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
very
illuminating,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
hoping
to
help
you
by
suggesting
it
wasn't
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
think
if
a
charge
was
ambiguous
that's
pretty
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rein
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
i
have
a
good
deal
of
--
i
have
more
than
sympathies
for
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
dissent
of
mr.
justice
jackson,
by
i
like
to
have
a
constitutional
question
thoroughly
argued
instead
of
resting
on
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
i'm
surprised
that
neither
you
nor
the
government
make
any
reference
either
to
union
bridge
or
monongahela
in
216
in
which
that
problem
was
reconsidered
on
a
rehearing
and
thoroughly
canvassed.
this
business
of
just
pulling
out
a
dissent
opinion,
and
i'm
thinking
that's
all
you
have
to
do
isn't
very
helpful
towards
the
determination
of
a
statute
which
has
stood
all
these
years
and
i
suggest
you
consider
both
of
you,
union
bridge
company
in
214,
and
monongahela
in
216,
which
on
principal
is
decisive
as
kind
of
a
situation,
namely
that's
where
the
secretary
of
war
made
a
declaration
and
there
was
disobedience,
criminal
prosecution
for
disobedience,
and
the
question
was
whether
the
administrative
determination
was
conclusive
in
the
criminal
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
doesn't
get
cases
out
of
the
sky,
one
has
to
look
for
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
those
are
the
only
ones,
but
those
that
happen
to
be
in
my
head,
and
this
is
a
very
serious
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
was
well
aware
of
it
when
he
joined
in
the
dissent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
what
day
--
the
case
is
no
longer
respected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
how
–
i'm
a
believer
of
venial
offense
but
the
monongahela
case
is
case
especially
important
because
there
the
court
was
asked
in
one
of
the
most
powerful
briefs,
in
my
recollection,
in
one
of
the
most
powerful
arguments
to
reconsider
a
decision
that
it
had
taken
several
years
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
exhibit
some
of
the
considerations
with
which
as
i
have
indicated
i
sympathize
or
urge
there
and
reject
it.
so
that
case
seems
to
me
of
a
special
reason
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
looked
at
your
brief
except
the
index
to
find
out
whether
you
cited,
does
the
government
set
forth
--because
when
it
comes
to
the
responsibility
of
actually
declaring
something
unconstitutional,
i
for
one
like
to
get
an
implication,
the
implication
of
such
definition.
has
the
government
cited
the
statute
that
would
be
--
that
would
equally
have
to
fall
if
this
argument
prevails?
i
should
think
there
must
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
shall
think
there
must
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
numerous
statutes
in
which
an
administrative
determination
has
made
the
basis
of
an
indictment
for
disobedience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
merely
volume
of
--
the
number
of
persons
affected,
but
the
body
of
legislation
if
there
be
a
body
that
presents
this
very
serious
problem
namely
to
what
extent
can
you
administratively
predetermine
an
element
of
the
criminal
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
controlling
would
mean
than
anybody
else
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bishop
you
till
now
hoped
to
me
that
i
wouldn't
have
to
read
the
record,
i'm
not
so
sure
after
listening
to
this
9in
colloquy
and
so
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
questions.
as
i
understand
you,
your
position
is
that
the
conviction
can
rest
on
count
two,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you
whether
the
sentence
can
be
sustained
if
count
two
is
sustained
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
judge
specifically
sentenced
on
count
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
on
both
counts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
the
record
sustains
count
two
then
there
is
raised
the
question
that
justice
harlan
put
to
you
earlier,
the
problem
of
resentence,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
problem
even
for
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know,
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
on
this
record
is
there
is
a
sentence
now
or
is
there
a
sentence
that
would
legally
be
imposed,
which
would
sustain
a
conviction
of
a
count
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
so
directing
myself
to
count
two,
i
want
to
ask
these
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
read
this
whole
record
and
i
haven't
read
it
at
all,
will
i
find
that
the
issue
under
count
two
was
the
issue,
not
what
could
have
been
the
issue,
what
might
have
been
made
the
issue
by
a
bill
of
particular
or
evidence
or
anything
else,
what
was
before
the
jury,
what
was
contested,
was
sought
to
be
proved,
now
as
resistance,
well
i
understand
there
was
no
evidence
for
the
defendant,
if
the
case
had
gone
to
the
jury
involved
making,
failure
to
make
a
timely
application,
in
good
faith
of
travel
or
other
documents
necessary
to
his
departure
from
the
united
states
and
i'm
going
to
add
it
was
stupendous,
was
that
the
issue
before
that
jury?
because
if
that
was
the
issue
before
the
jury
then
we
can't
tell
whether
they
might
have
found
it
was
sustainable
as
to
canada.
and
if
that
wasn't
the
issue,
but
if
the
issue
was
at
large
namely
did
he
take
no
step
whatever
during
six
months
to
get
a
travel
document
somewhere
either
his
choice
or
the
attorney
general's
designation,
which
it
was
within
his
power
to
obtain
not
foreclosed
either
because
finland
announced
they
wouldn't
give
any
visas
of
some
other
country,
then
we've
got
a
different
problem.
now
can
you
answer
that,
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
issue
with
reference
to
which
the
court
made
the
general
charge
to
the
jury?
it
doesn't
have
–
well
this
to
me,
a
good
abstract
charge
at
large
if
in
fact
the
only
evidence
before
the
jury
was
whether
or
not
he
could
get
a
piece
of
paper
that
would
take
him
to
finland.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
count
two
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
sustainable
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
isn't
the
important
thing
if
the
statute
was
cut
down
to
narrower
limits
in
the
proceedings
before
the
jury,
for
the
jury
when
it
retires,
retires
to
deliberate
regarding
the
matter
that
was
before
it
and
not
matter
that
wasn't
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
that
the
jury
was
there
before
the
jury
--
in
some
form
or
other,
in
a
legal
form
that
he
wasn't
restricted
to
applying
for
travel
to
finland.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
challenging
any
of
these
things,
i'm
trying
to
find
out,
i
must
say
i'm
considerably
confused
from
what
has
taken
place
back
and
forth.
now
when
they
went
for
the
jury
--
when
they
retire,
was
there
before
them
a
reasonable
basis
for
considering,
a)
whether
he
had
a
choice
not
restricted
to
finland
b)
there's
–
that
nothing
to
show
that
he
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
get
a
piece
of
paper
for
some
country
get
out
of
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
merely
what
you
call
prima
facie.
it
must
be
whatever
the
tag,
the
latin
tag
maybe,
are
there
enough
from
which
the
jury
could
have
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
person
having
a
duty
under
the
laws
instructed
by
the
court
to
get
a
piece
of
paper
to
get
out,
no
matter
what
think
of
the
whole
business,
to
get
a
piece
of
paper
to
get
out
somewhere,
there
was
no
restriction
upon
him
to
get
a
piece
of
paper
that
would
take
him
somewhere
out
of
the
confines
of
the
united
states.
