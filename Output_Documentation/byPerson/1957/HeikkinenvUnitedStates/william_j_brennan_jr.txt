does
the

take
a
labeling

â€“
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
is
the
service's
labeling
or
is
that
the
consequence
of
any
statute
or
just
something
the
service
does?

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
mean
page
9
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
all
add
in
the
--
you
raising
an
issue
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
government's
case
you
are
in
the
jury
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
motion
for
acquittal
at
the
closing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
take
the
stand
himself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all
that
there
is
in
the
case,
the
government's
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
were
exceptions
taken
to
the
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
plain
error
you
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
one
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
--
part
of
this
charge
which
reads
there
is
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
assist
the
defendant
affecting
his
departure.
the
government
will
if
requested
assistance,
but
the
duty
evolves
upon
the
defendant
to
comply
with
that
order
of
deportation,
and
i
know
this
that
an
express
exception
was
taken
to
that
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
not
making
a
point
on
your
brief
or
on
your
argument,
are
you
that,
that
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
improper
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
independently
and
not
as
bearing
on
the
issue
of
his
willfulness
or
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
but
just
as
an
incorrect
charge
in
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
get
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
not
independent
of
that
issue,
are
you
challenging
the
sufficiency
of
this
structure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
there
is
no
sentence
at
all
in
the
second
count,
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
is
a
judgment
of
conviction
before
us
on
that
second
count?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
there
is
an
argument
that,
this
if
so
would
be
true
only
if
the
statute
involved
here
was
invoked
by
the
government
to
secure
indictment
for
the
failure
of
its
part
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
in
respect
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
generally
that
an
administrative
determination
of
affordability
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
discuss
the
cox
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
is
the
practice,
is
there
any
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
further
before
you
get
to
that,
i
gather
that
this
obligation
part
is
only
those
who
are
deported
for
certain
reasons,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
assuming
he
was
for
the
purpose
of
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
for
the
purpose
of
my
question,
just
what
is
that
the
service
does
in
these
case,
where
there
is
an
obligation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
all
this
--
of
what
you've
now
said,
i
think
adds
up
for
me
to
this,
that
what
the
government
does
is
not
going
to
help
him,
but
rather
to
be
sure
that
he
is
out,
to
effect
the
congressional
intent
that
he
shall
be
got
out
of
the
country
within
the
time
limit,
either
on
his
own
or
because
the
government
gives
him
a
push,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
may
seem
clear
to
you,
but
does
it
make
clear
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
is
that
made
clear
to
the
deportee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
you
said
may
assist
him.
