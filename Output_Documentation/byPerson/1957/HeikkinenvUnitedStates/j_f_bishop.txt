mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
would
like
to
say
one
word
about
monongahela
before
i
go
into
the
argument.
there
is
a
delicate
question
of
the
extent
to
which
we
should
pledge
in
the
court
with
all
of
the
authorities
that
monongahela
case
was
back
in
216
us
177,
i'm
not
excusing
and
explaining
if
i
may.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
not
what
i
am
getting
at,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
were
recent
cases
that
followed
the
same
line,
we
cited
the
most
recent
ones,
the
ones
that
had
been
cited
by
for
comparison
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
case
of
spector
and
of
course
that
doesn't
absolve
us,
but
we
are
always
confronted
with
a
problem
of
making
a
brief
of
unwieldy
length
and
i
apologize
for
not
having
thrown
that
in.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
think
a
very
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
think
it's
of
great
help
to
the
government
and
i
also
--
we
have
not
cited
wadley
southern
railways
versus
georgia
235
us
561
and
--
which
we
think
is
very
significant.
we
did
not
cite
east
(inaudible)
or
accumulate
all
of
the
decisions
that
have
been
based
on
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
we
have
indicated
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
we
have
given
examples
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
we
have
cited
those
in
the
footnote
to
our
brief.
as
additional
examples
we
cited
of
course
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
most
pertinent
that
is
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
that
were
given
the
draft
classifications
and
the
numerous
cases
of
which
many
of
them
before
this
court
in
which
they
have
been
indicted.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
we,
as
i
said
we
have
cited
some
examples
of
that
in
the
federal
communications
commission,
civil
aeronautics
board,
we
also
cited
even
a
further
field
without
belaboring
the
point
we
cited
maki
in
the
bankruptcy
field
in
which
there
is
very
pertinent
language
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
believe
of
the
dangers
of
retrying
every
administrative
determination
by
the
--.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
i
am
stating
that
the
examples
that
we
did
give
and
that
is
not
only
the
administrative
area,
it
is
a
terrific
field
and
we
thought
that
the
thing
had
been
very
well
decided
more
recently
--
very
well.
now
this
case
has
so
many
issues
as
to
which
various
states
of
facts
are
pertinent
that
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
summarize
first
what
the
government
says
rather
than
leaving
to
its
presentation
before
as
to
what
we
contend
and
secondly
to
give
some
run
down
on
these
facts
and
their
order.
we
think
it's
very
important
that
when
a
certain
interview
happened,
when
a
certain
notice
was
served
and
i
am
going
to
try
the
rather
difficult
thing
of
at
least
presenting
this
whole
picture
so
that
we
have
the
order
because
after
all
this
is
a
very
important
request
that
this
court
should
go
over
a
cold
record
and
disbelieve
the
witnesses
that
the
jury
patently
believed,
get
the
impression
that
the
instructions
were
not
adequate
without
any
view
of
the
entirety
of
those
instructions
and
without
any
view
also
on
the
facts
that
were
in
the
case,
so
i
am
--
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
give
the
chronology
as
quickly
as
possible
with
the,
with
two
caveats
to
the
court.
one
i
expect
to
support
everyone
one
of
those
items
on
the
evidence
point
by
going
directly
to
the
record
later
after
i
finish
this
brief
summary
and
secondly
the
court
should
have
in
mind
that
since
there
are
some
other
questions
that
is
the
attack
on
the
deportation
proceedings,
the
innuendo
that
the
government
is
holding
out
things
and
is
entrapping
him
and
the
complaint
that
the
judge
shouldn't
have
sentenced
this
man
severely,
that
the
facts
--
that
other
certain
facts
that
were
before
the
judge
and
were
not
before
the
jury
are
going
to
have
to
be
told
in
this
chronology.
i
want
to
warn
the
court
that
when
i
get
to
discussing
the
evidence
before
the
jury,
then
i
will
restrict
myself
to
the
evidence
before
the
jury,
but
in
this
summary
relating
to
these
other
questions
at
the
outset,
the
facts
up
to
the
trial
are
in
exhibits
one
and
two
that
are
lodged
with
this
court
and
did
not
go
to
the
jury
because
this
judge
was
scrupulously
careful
to
keep
from
the
jury,
all
the
troublesome
things
that
had
been
adduced
to
him
in
the
assault
on
the
deportation
proceedings.
he
kept
even
the
board
of
immigration
appeals'
opinion
from
the
jury
and
only
allowed
to
be
read
in
the
facts
that
they
had
decided
against
petitioner
and
not
the
reasons.
so
in
this
chronology
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me,
when
i
get
to
the
evidence,
i
am
going
to
be
very
careful
of
what
was
before
the
jury,
that
i
don't
want
to
misrepresent
to
the
court
within
these
earlier
things.
there
is
--
all
of
this
went
to
the
judge.
now
petitioner
was
born
in
1890.
he
came
to
canada
in
1910
and
he
became
a
canadian
citizen.
he
has
been
a
canadian
citizen
for
anything
that
appears
on
the
record
all
of
the
time,
since
that
time
and
through
the
six
months
period
that's
critical
in
this
criminal
indictment
and
let
me
interrupt
myself
this
is
--
this
evidence
was
before
the
jury
as
well
as
all
the
other
cases.
he
has
been
a
canadian
citizen
for
over
40
years.
he
came
to
the
united
states
in
1916
and
that
entry
was
a
legal
entry,
probably
the
last
legal
entry.
he
joined
the
communist
party
in
1922
or
'23.
there
is
a
dispute
about
it,
but
there
is
no
dispute
that
he
was
in
it
until
1930.
the
court
of
appeals
below
found
that
he
had
been
communist
party
member
after
that.
he
went
to
russia
in
1932
without
travel
documents.
he
stayed
there
for
three
years
in
the
soviet
union.
he
came
back
in
1935
also
got
in
without
travel
documents.
then
in
19
--
i
should
say
also
that
for
15
years
he
was
editor
of
a
newspaper,
a
finnish
language
newspaper.
now,
in
1949
the
government
began
the
process
of
trying
to
deport
him.
at
that
time
there
were
two
grounds,
one
because
when
he
came
back
from
russia
he
came
out
--
came
in
without
the
proper
documents.
two
as
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization,
and
that
was
changed
after
the
1950
act,
to
the
specific
designation
of
the
communist
party
membership.
now
the
length
of
time
in
which
these
proceedings
were
delayed
i
don't
want
the
court
to
get
an
impression
of
any
improper
delay
there,
because
it
was
--
the
petitioner
was
entitled
of
course
to
pursue
every
remedy,
but
all
things
do
come
to
an
end
that
he
was
properly
ordered
deported
in
april
9
of
1952,
that
is
one
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
finally
included
these
deportation
proceedings,
after
many
--
after
appeals
to
that
board
and
the
matter
was
completed.
then
i
would
like
to
fix
that
date
by
repetition.
we
are
now
in
1952
and
we
are
beginning
that
six
months
period
in
which
the
statute
required
that
he
do
something.
now
we
will
look
at
that
statute,
which
was
passed
in
1950.
that
statute
provided
a
penalty
if
the
alien
did
not
depart,
if
the
alien
did
not
get
travel
documents
and
three,
not
indicted
here,
but
of
significant
contrast,
if
he
connived
to
hamper
the
getting
of
documents
for
it,
and
four
the
completely
differentiated
thing,
if
he
failed
to
show
up
when
the
attorney
general
ordered
him
to
show
up
for
deportation.
that's
the
statute
and
the
statute
of
course
is
presented
fully
in
our
brief
here
and
elsewhere.
well
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
summarize
in
its
opinion
those
four
aspects
of
it,
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
and
i
don't
know
that
the
petitioner
has
blankly
stated
that
there
is
any
doubt.
i
may
explain
about
that
statute,
that
it
arose
on
legislative
history,
not
concerning
the
separation
of
offences
as
has
been
stated
to
the
court,
but
to
meet
the
single
problem
that
there
were
hoards
of
aliens
left
in
this
country
who
just
couldn't
be
deported
and
the
legislative
history
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
was
the
testimony
before
the
congress,
before
prior
legislation
which
did
become
this
legislation
only
with
a
more
severe
criminal
penalty
indeed.
there
was
testimony
that
aliens
whom
the
government
could
not
deport
by
itself
applying
for
papers,
could
get
out
when
they
chose
to
do
so,
the
then
attorney
general,
now
of
this
court
testifies
as
to
nine
specific
cases
in
which
that
had
happened,
that
is
also
cited
in
our
brief
and
that
is
what
is
the
object
of
this
statute.
so
that
in
a
sense
the
inquiry
as
to
what
the
government
did
or
did
not
do
concurrently
is
not
significant.
now,
as
to
that
statute
let
me
state
something
else,
we
do
not
state,
nor
has
there
been
any
confusion
whatsoever
that
the
government
could
go
ahead
concurrently
and
as
an
ordinary
matter,
it
did
do
so.
it
did
not
trust
either
the
integrity
or
the
competence
of
some
of
these
aliens
to
get
going.
while
this
statute
was
specifically
designed
as
reported
from
the
congressional
record
to
give
an
incentive
to
these
aliens
to
do
something
themselves,
nevertheless
the
government
was
not
required
to
wait
for
them
to
do
something.
so
that,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
we
do
not
contend
here
that
the
government
can't
do
anything
or
that
the
government
doesn't
do
anything.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
ordinary
practice
as
of
this
date
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
correct
and
that
is
not
challenged
here.
he
was
of
the
group
that
was
designated,
except
there
is
a
statutory
ploy
question
which
i
will
try
to
reach
later,
in
which
they
contend
that
under
the
language
of
this
statute,
he
was
not
of
that
group,
i
don't
want
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
let
us
assume
that
for
this
and
our
brief
is
very
clear
on
that
point.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
will
answer
that
in
two
ways,
one
on
what
was
before
the
jury,
in
the
record
and
then
i
will
go
further
than
that,
if
the
court
wishes.
there
was
definite
and
uncontested
evidence
by
the
immigration
inspector
that
the
government
ordinarily
tries
to
get
the
man
out
even
while
he
is
making
his
concurrent
efforts,
but
there
was
a
definite
denial
that
the
government
does
it
in
all
cases
and
for
that
purpose,
let
me
explain
something
about
this
form
without
reaching
it
yet.
this
data
form
exhibit
9,
i
better
refer
to
it
that
way,
that
the
inspector
goes
out
right
after
the
deportation
order
and
gets,
is
an
information
form
on
which
the
government
tries
to
act,
but
on
the
back
of
that
form,
i'm
sorry
this
is
not
reprinted,
it
is
an
exhibit,
on
the
back
of
that
form
there
is
a
paragraph
in
which
it
is
asked
that
the
alien
disclose
whether
he
has
an
expired
passport,
birth
certificate
and
other
certificates
which
has
been
used
by
the
government.
if
he
disclosed
that
he
had
papers
already
and
could
get
out
by
himself,
in
those
cases
and
now
i'm
speaking
off
the
record,
the
government
does
nothing,
and
i
think
that
those
are
the
cases
referred
to
in
the
testimony
before
the
jury,
where
this
man
vigorously
denied,
i
mean
the
immigration
testimony,
vigorously
denied
that
in
all
cases
they
do
it.
very
diligent
counsel
for
petitioner
asked
his
man
maki
over
and
over
again,
the
immigration
inspector,
doesn't
this
mean
that
the
government
will
do
something,
and
he
repeatedly
said
no
they
will
consider
it,
that's
what
this
form
is
for;
this
is
not
an
application
form.
it
was
filled
out
by
the
immigration
inspector,
it
is
not
signed,
it's
a
data
form,
and
there
is,
and
i'm
quoting
the
record
here,
the
office
in
charge
stated
that
this
form
is
sometimes
taken
by
a
hearing
officer.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
application
for
documents
at
all,
and
of
course
it's
differentiated
from
document
because
it
refers
to
the
documents
right
within
the
form
asking
whether
he
has
it,
that
there
be
no
confusion
of
this
form,
once
it's
examined.
now
does
that
answer
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
it's
just
--
the
immigration
inspector
goes
out
after
a
deportation
order
and
he
tries
to
find
out
all
of
the
data
about
this
man.
the
object
of
course
is
for
the
government's
purposes
and
not
for
his
purposes,
so
that
the
government
can
get
going
on
efforts,
if
those
efforts
are
necessary.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
seems
so
clear
to
me
and
i
shall
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
why
--
that
is
clearly
my
understanding
of
it
and
that
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
deportee
is
not
advised
by
the
immigration
service,
the
immigration
service
could
submit
documents
if
it
chose
to
do
so,
and
request
him
to
sign
it
under
the
fourth
paragraph
of
this
statute
assuredly,
but
under
the
first
two
aspects
of
this
statute,
that
is
his
own
duty
to
depart,
his
own
to
duty
to
get
going
with
the
documents,
the
government
may
or
may
not
assist
him,
but
it
does
not
undertake
to
advise
him
and
i
might
state
going
back
to
the
actual
record
of
this
case
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
may
assist
him
assuredly,
if
he
should
ask
for
it,
i'm
sure
it
would,
but
--
and
let
me
point
to
two
things
in
this
record.
there
is
affirmative
clear
evidence.
the
officer
in
charge
definitely
testified
that
he
presented
a
canadian
passport,
to
this
man,
and
that
was
after
the
six
months
period,
so
that
there
is
no
question
of
expiry.
he
was
still
a
citizen
through
this
whole
six
months
as
far
as
this
record
discloses,
and
he
presented
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
he
had
been
--
had
lost
his
canadian
citizenship
until
afterwards,
and
as
the
records
says,
a
long
time
after.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
would
have
this.
that
after
six
months
if
he
couldn't
get
into
finland
by
himself,
the
statute
provides
that
then
attorney
general
shall
deport
him
to
where
it
can
be
gotten.
he
doesn't
a
clean
bill
of
health
to
sit
down
and
do
nothing
and
make
the
government
wait
in
that.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
does,
he
does,
but
i
am
stating
this
as
evidence
of
what
this
particular
petitioner
was
about
in
the
matter
of
competence
and
clever
heel
dragging.
the
six
months
went
by
there
is
no
slightest
evidence
that
he
did
anything
about
finland.
and
his
only
excuse
which
the
jury
frankly
did
not
buy
was
that
he
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
government
to
do
something
in
spite
of
the
statute,
in
spite
of
the
notice
which
i'll
get
to
and
in
spite
of
his
clear
duty.
he
said
that
he
got
the
impression
from
this
man
who
was
just
set
up
to
get
information
that
now
he
can
sit
down
and
do
nothing
that's
his
picture.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
am
tempted
to
deal
with
it
rather
emotionally
i
will
just
subside
and
say
this,
that
i
will
request
the
court
in
reading
this
form
of
notice
by
the
government
to
read
it
as
it's
put
in
the
footnote
of
the
government's
brief
in
its
entirety
and
without
italicizing.
the
jury
took
this
form
of
notice
into
the
jury
room
with
it.
and
when
it
is
read
without
prior
emphasis,
i
think
that
the
jury
was
well
entitled
not
to
rely
on
just
one
paragraph
of
it
but
recognize
that
form
for
what
it
was,
a
form
that
stated
a
variety
of
contingencies
and
what
is
more
particularly,
the
last
paragraph
which
could
not
have
related
to
the
government.
in
other
words
the
first
paragraph
advised
him,
the
government
was
going
to
try
to
act.
he
needed,
he
was
properly
warned
of
that.
then
it
stated
the
statute
which
showed
the
four
different
activities,
his
own
duty
to
depart,
his
own
duty
to
get
documents,
his
own
duty
not
to
connive
to
hamper
and
his
own
duty,
and
then
his
duty
not
to
refuse
the
documents
if
the
attorney
general
should
present
to
it.
and
then
comes
the
last
paragraph
of
all
which
if
we
were
italicizing,
i
would
italicize,
here
is
what
it
says.
“therefore
you
will
recognize
the
importance
of
making
every
effort
in
good
faith.”
let
me
stop
there,
if
they
have
been
talking
about
government
efforts,
they
wouldn't
have
said
in
good
faith,
they
were
talking
to
him
then.
“to
obtain
passport
or
other
travel
documents
so
that
you
may
affect
your
departure
pursuant
to
the
said
order
of
deportation
within
the
time
prescribed
by
the
quotation
above
from
the
internal
security
act.”
now
of
course
i
know
the
argument
on
that
and
that
is
that
he
was
a
poor
ignorant
man
that
couldn't
be
expected
to
deduce
all
of
those
from
this
notice.
but
the
answer
to
it
is
that
this
man
didn't
do
anything
without
checking
with
his
attorney,
he
had
long
experience
in
picking
everything
possible
available
to
his
case.
what's
that?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
very
much
so.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
yes
that
is,
that
is
affirmative
letter
indeed
and
i
am
getting
ahead
of
my
story
a
little
bit,
but
let
me
just
say
as
to
this
formal
notice.
when
it
was
read
without
the
italics
that
have
been
inserted
by
a
jury
which
is
perhaps
better
able,
the
judge
what
it
means
to
a
layman
than
i
as
a
lawyer
or
then
the
trial
judge
did,
that
jury
happily
could
have
seen
whether
anyone
would
be
confused
by
it
and
i
want
to
add
one
more
thing
and
then
i
will
get
on
with
the
chronology
of
it.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well
in
argument
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
in
argument
yes,
in
argument
yes.
not
in
the
statement
of
facts.
the
entire
thing
is
put
here.
in
other
words
in
any
denotable
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well
i
mean
that
that
i
feel
that
that
bringing
a
form
of
this
kind
with
italicizing
in
the
statement
of
facts
is
liable
to
get
a
person
off
on
the
wrong
start
in
the
argument
or
if
it
were
treated
as
a
summary
and
then
reporting
it,
well
then,
then
i
would
say
the
first
time
you
read
that,
you
can
read
it
in
its
entirety.
but
if
it's
the
first
time
in
the
statement
facts,
it
confronts
you,
you
are
bound
to
look
more
at
that
italicized
portion
than
the
exhibit
which
is
reproduced.
that
is
all,
i
have
to
say
that
is
all.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
is,
and
i
--
i
have
no
intent
to
say
that
there
was
anything
intentional
because
as
it
was
stated
in
the
brief
of
course
that
it
was
italicized,
but
this
is
was
a
statement
of
facts.
all
i
am
arguing
is
that
when
the
court
looks
at
this,
when
it
is
asked
to
set
aside
this
jury's
finding
on
the
whole
record
that
it
do
so
on
the
document
that
was
before
the
jury
and
without
prior
warning,
without
prior
standing
out
of
this
one
thing
out
of
a
long
list,
that's
all
to
that
moment.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
--
first
of
all
i
can't
pose
that
--
you
are
asking
of
course
what
it
would
mean
to
me?
the
first
thing
i
would
do,
would
be
to
go
to
a
lawyer
and
he'd
tell
me
very
quickly
and
i
would
rely
on
that,
because
he
would
know
what
that
statute
is
for.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
what's
that
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
second
thing
that
i
would
do
would
be
to
at
least
enquire
and
the
third
thing
i
question
whether
my
judgment
on
that
is
as
good
as
the
jury
that
have
had
that
form
before
it
and
was
told,
and
i
have
countered
this
in
the
record
17
times
it
appears
in
the
record
that
was
before,
that
was
read
to
this
jury
that
he
thought
that
it
meant
something
else.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
jury
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
believe
that
in
the
whole
context
of
the
instructions
anything
of
that
kind
was
said.
i
am
going
to
review
those
instructions
at
great
length
at
this
time,
but
i
can't
pull
one
word
on
the
instructions
when
the
world
‘willfully'
is
hammered
at
the
jury
as
often
as
it
was
here.
i
think
that
there
was
no
doubt
possible
for
this
jury
that
a
number
of
times
it
was
emphasized
in
the
evidence
in
petitioners'
own
words
that
he
had
been
confused
that
this
jury
couldn't
size
up
the
man
they
had
before
them,
very
well
indeed
and
better
than
i
could
on
the
whole
record,
because
i
didn't
see
the
witness
that
told
about
this
man.
now
this
notice
of
course
comes
in
a
chronology
and
i
think
i
better
get
back
to
the
order
in
which
that
notice
appeared
so
that
we'll
have
that
as
it
appeared
also
before
the
jury
in
evidence.
in
other
words
i
had
gotten
to
the
point
where
the
deportation
proceedings
had
finally
resulted
in
an
order
of
deportation
and
then
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
not
being
noticed.
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
the
investigator
came
out
to
get
data.
now
petitioner,
enough
has
been
said
about
what
petitioner
says
he
got
as
an
impression,
i
can
only
recommend
that
the
court
go
very
carefully
to
the
testimony
of
this
man
maki
and
also
to
the
testimony
of
the
officer
in
charge
at
duluth,
both
of
whom
stated
very
specifically
what
--
what
this
man
was
to
do.
he
was
out
there
to
get
information.
he
was
not
out
there
to
instruct
the
deportee
as
to
his
duties.
he
was
not
out
there
the
least
of
all
with
any
authority
to
waive
what
the
congress
have
enacted
to,
where
the
congress
had
said
it's
your
duty
--
for
him
to
go
out
and
say
well
it's
your
duty
until
the
--
after
the
government
has
done
something.
that
wasn't
in
the
statute,
that
wasn't
in
the
notice.
now
the
testimony
of
maki
is
very
clear
and
i
expect
to
get
to
that
too
if
i
can
just
get
on
to
the
dates.
april
9
was
the
date
of
deportation,
april
21
this
man
maki
came
to
get
the
information
for
this
sheet
and
went
his
way.
petitioner
didn't
sign
anything.
he
according
to
maki,
according
to
the
only
live
testimony
before
this
jury,
maki
said
nothing
of
the
kind,
he
got
his
information
and
left,
he
remembered
the
interview
very
well.
then
on
the
30th
of
april
this
form
notice
came
out
and
petitioner
was
advised
of
whatever
that
form
meant,
but
the
form
as
i've
stated
is
in
the
exhibits
left
before
the
jury.
it's
not
something
that
was
in
the
side
proceedings
at
all.
now,
nothing
was
done
by
petitioner.
there
was
no
inquiry
made
by
petitioner
as
to
what
it
could
mean
or
as
to
why
the
government
was
so
long
about
speaking
to
him
again
about
it
if
he
had
truly
thought
the
government
was
getting
him
some
papers,
i
don't
think
he
would
have
quite
weighed
it
that
happened
here,
at
least
that's
an
item
that
the
jury
could
well
evaluate,
especially
when
all
he
had
to
do
was
pick
up
the
phone
and
ask
about
the
matter,
and
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
what's
that?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
officer
in
charge
at
duluth.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
he
would
call
up
the
office
to
find
out
what
was
happening.
in
fact
there
is
affirmative
testimony
after
the
six
months
were
over,
and
the
matter
began
to
get
a
little
bit
hot
and
he
was
being
investigated
as
to
why
he
hadn't
done
anything
then
he
admitted
that
he
had
wondered
a
little
bit
about
it
himself.
well,
so
much
for
that
six
months
period,
and
i
think
a
great
deal
of
light
is
cast
upon
what
he
was
thinking
about
and
what
he
was
trying
to
do
by
the
events
immediately
after
that
six
months
period.
under
the
law,
if
he
hasn't
left
in
six
months,
has
not
been
deported
by
the
government
in
six
months,
it
comes
under
supervision
as
this
court
knows
from
other
cases.
he
was
called
in
on
october,
in
october
and
here
we
have
the
testimony
of
a
man
bolton,
who
was
an
immigration
inspector,
who
gave
him
his
order
of
supervision
and
at
that
time
it
was
affirmatively
brought
to
his
attention
the
matter
of
his
own
efforts
to
get
travel
documents
and
there
was
a
specific
clause
put
in
to
his
supervision
order
to
report
his
evidence.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
was
october
27th,
right
at
the
end
of
this
period.
now,
if
the
jury
was
to
believe
his
protestations
of
innocence,
they
could
not
have
lasted
beyond
that
time,
and
yet
he
did
nothing,
from
that
time
on
for
another
quarter
of
a
year.
in
february,
bolton
went
out
to
check
up
with
him
and
that
is
when
this
statement
came
and
then
come
these
excuses,
and
among
other
things
he
was
asked
was,
what
he
thought
that
clause
was
about,
as
to
why
he
hadn't
reported
any
efforts
to
get
documents,
and
at
that
time,
he
didn't
give
the
--
ask
for
that
one,
he
didn't
state
that
he
had
relied
on
that
interview
anymore,
then
he
said
he
must
have
missed
that,
and
that's
in
the
record
too,
that
went
before
the
jury.
so
that
what
the
--
what
you
have
is
the
picture
of
a
man
and
this
is
the
government's
view
of
it
and
we
submit
the
jury's
view
of
it,
that
was
dragging
his
heals
as
long
as
he
could,
and
then
when
he
couldn't
succeed
any
longer
still
did
nothing.
and
here
is
the
critical
thing,
after
that
six
months
period
expired,
the
officer
in
charge
was
presented
him
with
a
canadian
--
presented
a
canadian
passport
to
him,
and
there
is
testimony
before
the
jury
of
the
additional
documents
that
would
have
been
required
for
getting
into
canada
and
you
may
judge
as
the
jury
could
judge
from
that
testimony,
whether
there
would
have
been
a
deal
for
him
to
get
into
canada.
he
did
nothing
then
either.
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
he
was
planning
to
stay
as
long
as
he
could
and
that
was
it.
now
i
have
given
a
chronology
here
and
i
had
said
that
i
was
going
to
back
it
up
and
now
i
want
to
go
to
the
record
of
what
was
before
this
jury,
and
i
think
that
the
proper
place
to
start,
i
am
now
exclusively
in
what
was
before
this
jury.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
oh,
that
is
in
the
record
too.
that
question
was
posed
to,
it
was
asked
and
the
immigration
inspector
was
asked
about
the
processes,
while
he
didn't
claim
to
know
that
this
particular
petitioner
would
have
had
to
do,
he
would
go
to
the
consul
or
whoever
or
the
lawyer
with
whom
he
was
in
touch
in
new
york,
go
to
the
consulate,
get
the
papers
and
fill
them
out
and
try
to
get
in.
now
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
see
that,
that
follows.
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
finnish
consulate
in
duluth
or
a
superior,
where
there
are
a
great
number
of
finns,
but
in
any
event
his
attorney
could
have
handled
it
for
him
or
he
could
have
written.
there
is
no
great
mystery
about
applying
to
the
consulate
to
which
you
are
--
if
you
really
sincerely
want
to
go,
you
ask
and
get
the
documents
and
you
fill
them
out.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
think
that
is
true,
i
said
that
he
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no.
he
didn't
want
to
commit
himself.
he
didn't
state
that
he
had
seen
any
evidence
of
this
man
doing
anything
at
the
time,
but
he
point
to
a
certificate
of
identity
and
the
normal
documents.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
who?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
not
on
the
record,
and
the
reason
it
is
not
on
the
record
is
because
the
question
of
whether
the
government
could
get
it
is
just
what
this
statute
was
designed
to
obviate.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
do
you
want
me
to
go
off
the
record?
i
mean
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
the
government
did,
the
complaint
here
is
totally
of
what
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
know
of
none,
the
petitioner
didn't
put
in
any
testimony.
he
asked
for
the
government
records
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
as
to
what
the
government
did
and
that's
what
i've
used
as
being
impertinent
to
this
enquiry,
because
the
whole
step
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
in
this
way.
if
you
had
proof
that
the
government
applied
to
soviet
russia
to
take
him
back.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well
i'm
giving
an
example,
i'll
get
to
that.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
would
say
the
same
thing,
if
the
government
sent
papers
to
finland
and
couldn't
get
action
on
them,
that
is
no
proof
that
he
could
not
have,
and
i'll
go
to
the
record
on
that.
the
record
shows
in
exhibit
9
that
this
man
had
a
sister
who
was
married
to
a
district
judge
in
finland,
i
don't
think
it
needs
much
savoir
faire
to
know
that
he
might
have
done
a
lot
better
job
on
it
than
the
government
if
he
had
been
so
disposed.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
say
that
he
could
get
them,
but
i
say
that
the
effort
of
the
government,
the
success
or
failure
of
the
government
is
not
--
it
gives
no
idea.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
but
he
was
not
restricted
to
finland.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
supplied
by
the
alternative
that
was
given.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
canada,
he
was
a
canadian
citizen,
in
fact
there
is
a
very
serious
doubt
which
the
jury
could
legitimately
find
from
the
record
as
to
whether
he
wasn't
indulging
in
the
trick
of
naming
finland
because
that
would
be
tough,
whereas
canada
was
what
he
was
a
citizen
of
could
of
walked
across
the
border
with
just
numbers
on
him.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
was
convicted
for
wilfully
doing
nothing.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
there
was
no
such
distinction.
he
was
convicted
of
a
fact
that
he
did
not
leave,
and
that
he
applied
for
new
documents.
that
was
(inaudible),
not
that
the
government
didn't
--
that
the
government
presented
anything,
it's
admitted
the
government
didn't
get
him
out.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
had
asked
for
that
bill
of
particulars;
it
would
have
shown
only
first
on
the
affirmative
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
was
still
around
at
the
end
of
the
six
months.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
that
isn't
all.
well,
his
duty
was
not
restricted
to
going
to
the
place
where
he
chose,
especially
when
he
chose
a
country
of
which
he
hadn't
been
a
citizen
for
40
years
and
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
had
a
right
to
make
the
election
in
the
first
instance,
but
if
he
applied
to
finland
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
persists
only
to
the
time
where
he
gets
busy,
files
travel
documents
and
is
told
no.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
right,
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
believe
so,
if
it
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
he
was
turned
down
–
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
concur
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
play
around
for
six
months
if
you
know
you
can't
go
to
finland;
you
have
to
get
busy,
find
your
papers
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
would
say
that
the
government
makes
its
prima
facie
case
by
showing
that
he
didn't
go
and
that
the
evidence
afterward
showed
us
a
great
disposition
not
to
go,
and
a
failure
on
his
part
then
to
go
forward
with
the
evidence,
to
show
what
he
did
do.
the
government
cannot
negate
that
he
applied
to
finland
or
that
he
applied
to
anyone
of
a
half
a
dozen
other
countries,
the
countries
that
he
could
have
gone
to.
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
any
country
he
wanted
and
he
was
also
allowed
the
choice,
but
he
was
not
allowed
a
choice
to
sit
around
and
do
nothing
and
then
say
prove
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
did.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
any
time
that
he
could
have
disclosed
another
country
under
the
regulations,
the
officer
in
charge
could
have
permitted
him
to
get
out,
he
was
not
--
that
was
not
binding
him.
his
duty
was
to
get
out
and
the
statutory
duty
is
not
couched
in
limiting
him
to
making
one
effort.
he
gets
the
first
choice
and
that
is
only
the
springboard
for
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
make
a
choice.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
what's
that?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
he
proves
that
he
made
some
efforts
he
does.
if
he
does
not,
why
we
can't
speculate
after
it's
shown
that
he
is
still
here,
that
he
did
anything.
that
is
evidence
that
is
so
clearly
within
his
own
power
to
produce
if
he
were
actually
in
good
faith
that
the
government
by
having
taken
the
laboring
off,
putting
in
evidence
that
he
wasn't
there,
putting
in
evidence
showing
a
clear
disposition
to
drag
his
heels
even
when
he
could
go
after
the
six
months,
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
has
to
disprove
every
possible
explanation
he
could
have
made.
he
was
still
here
at
the
end
of
the
six
months.
he
was
doing
nothing.
he
didn't
say
he
was
doing
anything.
he
admits
that
he
did
nothing
because
he
says
the
reasons
he
did
nothing
was
he
had
an
impression
that
he
could
nothing.
this
is
not
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
right,
now
how
does
it
go
about
proving?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
right
and
here
is
the
way
it's
proved.
the
government
first
put
in
testimony
that
he
was
still
here,
no
question
about
his
failure
to
depart.
there
is
no
quarrel
about
that.
two,
it
put
in
the
testimony
in
which
he
had
admitted
he
did
nothing.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
he
admitted
he
did
nothing.
the
only
excuse
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
to
where?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
canada,
it
did
prove
that,
it
had
testament.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
was
after
the
six
month
period,
he
chose
his
disposition.
but
you're
speaking
now
-
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
government
only
has
to
prove
on
this
second
count
we
are
discussing
that
he
did
not
apply
for
the
documents.
he
admitted
that,
that's
in
the
evidence.
he
did
not
make
any
application
anywhere.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
both,
failure
to
get
documents.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
has
to
prove
that.
it
has
made
its
prima
facie
case.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
five.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
there
is
no
way
that
the
government
can
prove
that
because
he
has
to
apply
for
documents
himself,
to
make
that
proof
possible.
the
government
cannot
prove
that
he
can't
go
here
and
he
can't
go
there
if
he
doesn't
even
take
the
first
step.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
the
--
that
he
supposes
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
but
the
proof
of
that.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
is
amply
made
out
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
what's
that?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
government
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence,
but
after
it
has
gone
forward
with
the
evidence
of
showing
that
he
didn't
do
a
thing,
the
government
is
no
position
to
prove
that
if
he
had
done
something,
in
this
sort
of
a
case
that
they
would
have
been
successful,
because
there
are
so
many
efforts
that
are
diligent
he
thought
he
can
employ,
that
was
why
this
statute
was
passed.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
in
this
respect,
the
government
proves
he
is
still
here.
it's
common
knowledge
and
i
think
that
this
much
can
be
conceded
that
some
people
can
get
in
to
various
countries.
he
is
not
restricted
to
finland,
he
is
not
restrict
to
finland.
if
the
fact
is
that
finland
would
not
take
him,
he
could
explore
that
fact
if
you
just
sat
tight
and
done
nothing.
we're
not
quarreling
here
about
how
much
he
has
to
do,
or
what
it
would
have
disclosed,
this
is
a
case
where
he
just
did
nothing
at
all,
and
his
whole
reliance
is
that
he
thought
he
didn't
have
to
do
anything
at
all
now.
now
the
government
has
shown
that
he
was
still
here.
his
--
there
is
the
fact
that
was
before
the
jury
that
he
was
able
to
get
in
and
out
of
russia
on
his
own,
that
he
was
able
to
get
in
and
out
of
canada
on
his
own.
now
wait
a
second
let
me
retract
that.
that
business
of
the
fact
that
he
had
gotten
in
and
out
of
canada
on
his
own
without
difficulty
is
in
exhibit
1
here
which
was
before
the
judge,
not
before
the
jury,
but
he
had
shown
great
facility
in
that
respect
and
the
fact
and
with
those
facts
before
the
jury.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
what's
that?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
on
the
russian
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i'm
speaking
of
the
soviet
--
after
his
three
years
in
the
soviet
union
he
came
in,
and
without
papers.
to
canada,
he
went
to
canada
and
it's
not
--
and
exhibit
1
doesn't
indicate
the
means
that
he
went
in
and
out,
but
he
did
do
that,
but
i
don't
want
to
bid,
i
don't
want
to
go
at
it
in
that
respect,
but
what
i
do
want
to
show
here
is
that
the
failure
to
prove
that
finland
would
take
him
is
not
conclusive,
because
the
government
did
show
that
even
if
finland
had
not
taken
him,
he
could
have
gotten
into
canada
and
the
government
cannot
disprove
that
he
couldn't
have
gotten
into
russia
or
any
one
of
1,000
places.
the
government
cannot
just
prove
that
if
he
had
gotten
going,
that
he
wouldn't
have
been
as
successful
as
thousands
of
other
people
are
successful.
the
government
did
prove
to
the
jury
that
this
man
had
no
disposition
to
anything
and
then
if
he
had
failed
in
finland
he
could
have
gotten
into
canada,
that's
affirmative
and
that's
there.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
are
you
saying
that
the
conviction
on
count
one
can
rest
on
count
two?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
sentence
was
on
count
one,
the
failure
to
apply,
correct?
is
this
the
--
is
this
directed
to
your
question?
the
sentence
was
on
count
one
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes
and
the
sentence
was
deferred
on
count
two
failure
to
get
documents.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
did
that,
it
found
him
guilty
on
both
counts.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well
that
was
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
a
problem.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that,
but
if
the
statement
is
that
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
it
has
taken
five
years.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
issue
before
the
jury
was
this
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
on
count
two.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
the
statute
embodied
a
blanket
command
that
he
apply
for
the
travel
documents,
and
also
within
a
reasonable
time,
time
length
etc.
it
did
not
specify
and
i
don't
think
the
statute
indicates
in
any
respect
that
he
was
restricted
to
any
country
or
to
the
country
that
he
designated
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
right,
the
jury
retired
to
deliberate
on
the
question
as
to
whether
he
in
good
faith
made
timely
application
for
documents,
it
had
before
it
his
own
statement
that
he
didn't
do
a
thing.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
think
that
that
was
clearly
before
the
jury
in
the
affirmative
testimony
of
the
officer
in
charge
that
if
they're
presenting
the
canada
affidavit.
i
think
it
was
also
before
the
jury
in
this
form
9,
which
disclosed
that
he
had
been
a
canadian
citizen
for
40
years.
it
was
before
the
jury
in
the
testimony
of
the
immigration
officer
as
to
what
nominal
documents
you
need
in
addition
as
a
canadian
citizen
to
go
from
the
superior,
wisconsin
to
canada.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
answer
is
yes
to
both
for
those
alternatives,
yes.
that
was
before
the
jury
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
think
that
was
clearly
before
the
jury.
that
was
clearly
before
the
jury
and
the
--
and
he
didn't
even
--
and
that
sort
of
thing
was
not
raised
at
the
trial.
what
was
before
the
jury
was
his
excuse
that
he
was
an
innocent
man.
that
was
the
–
that
was
the
only
problem
before
that
jury
and
they
just
didn't
believe
him.
they
believed
the
testimony
that
was
before
them.
i
have
–
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
get
to
that
record,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
best
–
the
instructions
i
can
only
ask
that
the
entirety
of
the
instructions
be
read
with
a
repetitious
and
careful
separation
of
these
two
offenses
in
several
readings
and
with
the
repeated
emphasis
on
willfulness
and
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
this
jury
had
a
hammered
into
it,
as
i
said,
17
times
that
the
petitioner
didn't
say
he
tried
to
do
anything
but
he
just
thought,
he
didn't
have
to
and
that
was
the
issue
and
the
instructions
were
very
clearly
as
to
that
issue
so
forth,
i
do
wanted
to
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well
it
seem
to
me
it
was
more
than
4,
5
pages.
i
want
to
say
this
that
on
willfulness
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
some
discussion
with
the
judge
before
the
instructions
were
framed
and
there
had
been
some,
even
some
quarreling
about
that
one
might
say
the
–
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
right
and
there
was
no
exception
taken
to
that.
in
fact
very
diligent
counsel
accepted
to
everything
and
you'll
find
this
in
the
record
right
up
to
the
word
‘willfulness,'
so
that
we
must
presume
that
to
the
counsel
who
was
present
at
that
hearing
that
that
instruction
did
the
job
and
posed
fairly
enough
before
the
jury
the
question
as
to
whether
this
man
actually
believed
he
could
do
nothing
or
whether
was
just
dragging
his
heels
and
figuring
on
crying
about
it
later.
i
think
that
this
record
as
it
is
read
will
prove
very
definitely
that
the
government
proved
that
everything
that
it
can
prove
and
that
it,
that
it
made
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
these
matters
in
defense,
and
these
speculations
that
he
couldn't
have
gotten
into
finland
or
into
other
countries
are
speculations
that
he
frankly
didn't
back
up
by
himself
going
forward
with
the
evidence
and
showing
that
he
filed
some
papers
in
finland
and
was
turned
down.
that
didn't
happen.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
assuredly
this
statute
is
not
a
trap.
if
he
had
gone
in
good
faith
anywhere
and
been
turned
down,
he
would
not
have
been
willful.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
correct.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes
it
was
intended
and
he
presented
--
the
only
thing
that
he
did
present
at
the
trial,
an
affirmative
defense.
he
did
not
present
the
affirmative
defense
that
he
couldn't
have
gotten
them
if
he
had
tried,
he
said
he
didn't
do
anything
at
all
because
he
had
gotten
the
impression
from
this
limited
officer
that
came
to
get
questions
answered
that
he
didn't
have
to
do
anything.
well
the
statute
said
he
did
notice,
we
did
and
the
jury
had
that
notice
too
and
the
government
cannot
go
and
disprove
all
the
defenses
that
might
be
contradictory.
the
government
proved
its
case,
and
the
jury
believed
it.
now
we
are
supposed
to
go
on
a
whole
record
and
speculate
that
if
he
had
gone,
if
he
had
really
made
energetic
efforts
to
get
into
finland,
he
couldn't
have
done
it,
well
there
is
no
proof
of
that.
and
the
government
did
prove
that
he
did
nothing
and
the
government
in
a
case
of
this
kind
cannot
undertake
to
disapprove
every
possible
defense.
the
government
has
gone
form
over
the
evidence.
it
has
the
ultimate
burden
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
the
question
of
fact,
may
i
answer
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
question
of
fact
which
was
put
before
the
jury
and
it
would
not
rest
alone
on
the
letter
but
on
all
of
the
facts
which
disclosed
that
this
man
was
a
very
cynical
man,
who
relied
on
his
attorney
and
who
could
have
enquired
about
this
letter
and
who
did
nothing
even
when
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it.
