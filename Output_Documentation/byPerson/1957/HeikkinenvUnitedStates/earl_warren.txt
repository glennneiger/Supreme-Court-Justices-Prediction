chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rein,
was
there
any
such
language
in
that
form,
that
original
form
that
you
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago,
was
a
clause
like
that
given?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
blank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
a
common
prosecution
or
is
it
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
entire
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
entire
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
object,
why
do
object
to
italicizing
this,
don't
you
do
the
same
thing
in
your
briefs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
a
lot
of
ways
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
quite
understand
you
when
you
said
you
were
tempted
to
treat
this
thing
emotionally,
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
all
the
emotion
you
have
in
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop
may
i
just
pursue
one
important
step
further,
don't
you
believe
that
if
you
are
deportee
or
this
time
that
the
form
was
presented
to
you
in
circumstance
of
this
kind
that
you
might
emphasis
a
paragraph
of
this
kind
where
it
says
arrangements
to
effect
your
deportation
pursuant
to
such
order,
the
one
that
they
are
talking
about
here,
are
being
made
and
when
completed
you
will
be
notified
when
and
where
to
present
yourself
with
the
petition.
don't
you
think
that
might
strike
a
deportee
as
a
rather
foreseeable
and
rather
expressing
the
intent
of
the
government
to
do
something?
what
would
it
mean
if
it
didn't
mean
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
my
instruction
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
might
not
--
that
instruction
that
counsel
was
talking
about
have
something
to
do
with
that
where
the
court
told
him
or
whether
he
believed
that
the
government
was
going
to
do
anything
or
not
that
he
was
still
guilty
if
he
didn't,
if
he
didn't
take
the
steps?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
would
he
ask?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
would
he
ask?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
immigration
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
man
who
testified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop
could
i
interrupt
you
just
once
more
to
ask
you
how
would
a
man
in
duluth
go
about
getting
this
passport
or
getting
this
visa
to
go
back
to
finland?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
wait
a
minute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
man
living
in
duluth,
would
be
obliged
to
go
to
new
york.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
apparently
there
is
some
mystery
so
far
as
the
immigration
inspector
was
concerned
he
didn't
how
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
just
told
us
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
russia,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not
take
(inaudible)
he
did
want
to
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
got
in
without
papers,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
use
papers
at
that
time,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
get
him
around
to
canada.
i
thought
the
government
didn't
know
how
he
came
in,
he
came
in
surreptitiously,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
of
course.
