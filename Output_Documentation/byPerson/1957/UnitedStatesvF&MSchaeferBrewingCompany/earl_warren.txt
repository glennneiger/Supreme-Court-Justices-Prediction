chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burke,
the
--
the
complaint
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
wonder
if
the
judgment,
the
final
judgment,
whichever
is
the
final
judgment,
used
judgment
for
the
precise
amount
paid
for
in
the
complaint.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burke,
would
you
--
would
you
answer
justice
black's
question
to
mr.
sand
as
to
whether
you
wouldâ€™ve
levied
the
execution
on
that
first
minute
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
--
what
was
the
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
you
--
why
did
you
compute
it
up
to
the
formal
judgment
if
you
rely
it
on
the
--
on
the
first
minute
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
took
the
same
position
as
the
government
at
that
time.
