mr.
thomas
c.
burke
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
as
to
the
timeliness
of
the
appeal
in
this
case
depends
on
when
judgment
was
rendered
and
when
judgment
was
entered.
although
that
question
may
depend
to
some
extent
on
local
rules
and
practice
as
they
affect
judicial
intent,
our
first
point
of
departure
is
rule
58
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
plaintiff's
contention
of
respondent
here,
is
that
in
this
case,
rule
58
disposes
of
the
question
completely
without
ever
having
to
resort
to
local
rules
to
ascertain
the
judicial
intent.
this
was
a
case
for
the
recovery
of
money
only.
the
sentence
of
rule
58
which
mr.
justice
whittaker
read
a
few
moments
ago
expressly
provides
that
where
only
money
is
recovered
where
there
is
a
direction
for
the
recovery
only
of
money,
judgment
is
to
be
entered
forthwith.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
rule
of
--
of
--
i
don't
want
to
dispute
the
--
the
--
but
i
would
like
to
quote
the
exact
language
of
the
rule
which
states,
"when
the
court
directs
that
a
party
recover
only
money,
etcetera,
the
clerk
shall
enter
a
judgment
forthwith
upon
receipt
by
him
of
the
direction."
the
word
direction
must
prefer
to
the
--
relate
back
to
the
word
directs
in
the
clause
preceding
it.
it's
enough
that
there
be
a
direction
for
the
recovery
of
money
to
permit
the
clerk
to
enter
a
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
--
is
a
--
are
you
referring
to
the
final
judgment
as
the
later
document
which
the
judge
signed?
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
oh,
may
i
say
this
that
the
compliant
does
expressly
set
forth
the
amount
that
was
paid
and
for
which
suit
was
being
brought.
it
also
sets
forth
the
date
of
payment
so
that
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
the
amount
of
interest
or
the
amount
of
the
recovery
attack
itself.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
judgment
sets
forth
the
--
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
was
paid.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
there
was
no
dispute
over
the
dates.
the
--
the
judge
might
or
might
not
have
put
it
in
but
there
was
certainly
no
reason
for
his
putting
it
in.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
clerk
can
automatically
compute
the
interest.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
hindsight,
mr.
justice
harlan,
suggest
to
us
that
--
that
it
might
have
been
the
better
course
not
to
do
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
cannot
say
from
personal
knowledge
why
it
was
done
except
that
the
individual
who
did
prepare
and
submit
it
may
have
been
affected
by
notions
of
state
practice.
the
fact
that
it
was
done
however,
what
we
submit,
cannot
affect
the
proper
instruction
of
this
federal
rule.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
well,
may
i
say
this,
your
honor,
it
--
it
is
certainly
a
frequent
thing
to
do.
i
can't
introduce
any
statistics
as
to
how
often
it's
done.
but
in
view
of
the
repeated
pronouncements
of
the
second
circuit
that
the
practice
is
incorrect,
i
can't
see
any
reason
why
it
should
be
considered.
and
i
can't
see
that
it
should
be
allowed
to
become
the
correct
practice
merely
because
lawyers
do
what
their
circuit
says
that's
improper.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
--
in
all
inclusive
rule
can
be
stated
on
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
for
this
reason,
there
are
--
there
are
two
types
of
cases,
i
think.
the
first
type
would
be
where
the
direction
for
the
recovery
of
money
is
clear
on
its
basis.
we
say
parenthetically
that
it
was
clear
here
because
the
amount
was
stated
in
the
opinion
and
the
opinion
was
clear
that
it
represented
the
respondent's
adjudication.
the
second
type
of
case
would
be
where
the
direction
is
not
so
clear.
it
may
or
may
not
constitute
a
direction.
in
those
cases,
the
judicial
intent
can
be
clarified
by
--
resort
to
local
rules
in
practice.
when
we
do
that
on
each
case,
assuming
that
the
direction
was
not
clear
on
its
face,
we
find
a
local
rule
which
states
that
the
memorandum
of
a
termination
of
a
motion
shall
constitute
the
order.
the
order
is
a
direction
and
therefore
under
the
local
rule
which
have
now
been
construed
by
--
by
the
number
of
decisions
of
the
second
circuit
and
are
no
longer
open
to
doubt
as
to
their
own
rule.
under
those
local
rules,
we
do
have
the
words
of
direction
which
might
or
might
otherwise
be
spelled
out
from
the
district
judge's
actions.
turning
just
briefly
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
there
is
very
little
in
the
decided
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
roth
case
thus
--
makes
some
analysis
of
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
united
states
versus
roth.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
that
case
did
not
come
up
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
not
on
that
point.
in
that
case,
there
is
some
analysis
of
local
practice
but
it
is
not
by
any
means
all
inclusive
and
really
doesn't
a
shed
a
great
deal.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
well,
of
course,
i
believe
in
this
case
that
in
any
circuit,
the
government's
appeal
would
have
been
untimely
by
reason
of
rule
58.
i
certainly
agree
that
appeal
should
be
expeditious
in
--
in
all
circuits.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
question
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
it's
possible
although
--
we
don't
know
that
the
clerk
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
should
be
that
the
clerk's
job
is
not
to
decide
or
to
interpret
but
simply
to
record.
if
the
opinion
did
constitute
a
judgment,
then
the
clerk's
act
in
duly
recording
it
was
an
act
of
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
oh
that's
what
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
but
our
point
is
that
the
clerk
is
directed
by
the
rules
to
perform
a
ministerial
act
which
he
did
in
fact
perform
on
the
earlier
date.
and
if
he
performed
all
that
was
required
under
the
rules,
then
there
was
a
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
he
might
not
have
thought
about
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
he
performed
his
ministerial
duty
in
--
in
entering
the
judgment
on
the
earlier
date
and
he
may
or
may
not
have
thought
that
that
was
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
when
the
later
document
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
that
entry
was
enough
to
tell
anyone
who
is
interested
in
the
case
exactly
what
had
happened.
the
parties
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
there
had
been
only
one
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
that
motion
was
granted.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
well,
may
i
say
this
that
there
is
a
difference
between
what
a
party
may
do
and
a
difference
between
what
he
ought
to
do.
we
don't
claim
to
be
able
to
shed
--
to
destroy
the
validity
of
the
judgment
by
any
actions
which
we
may
have
taken
ourselves.
if
what
was
done
on
the
earlier
date
did
constitute
the
entry
of
judgment,
nothing
we
could
do
to
change
that
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
was
just
turning
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
and
i
can
only
state
in
my
opinion
as
a
lawyer
and
not
from
any
factual
material
in
the
record
that
execution
could
have
been
obtained.
the
practice
in
the
second
circuit
is
that
a
lawyer
acting
as
an
officer
of
the
court
swears
out
a
writ
of
execution
before
the
clerk.
the
clerk
may
or
may
not
check
some
record
of
judgments.
assuming
that
the
clerk
first
of
all
might
have
refused
to
issue
an
execution,
if
in
fact,
there
was
a
judgment
here,
there
was
certainly
a
procedure
whereby
the
clerk
could
have
been
directed
to
issue
execution.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
why?
i
don't
think
there
are
or
has
been
such
an
attempt,
mr.
chief
justice
but
further
proceedings
by
way
of
mandamus
would
undoubtedly
be
proper.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
believe
it
could
have,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
on
that
--
the
execution
could
have
included
interest,
i
believe.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
oh
well,
the
money,
the
--
the
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
amount
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
--
the
amount
would
have
been
the
tax
plus
interest.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
of
course,
the
judge
said
more
than
that.
he
said
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
in
any
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
you
may
go
behind
the
judgment,
we
submit.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
we
think
we
do,
mr.
justice
black
and
we
think
that
the
federal
rules
contemplate
it.
rule
58,
another
portion
of
the
rule
expressly
states
that
entry
of
judgment
is
not
to
be
delayed
for
the
taxing
of
cost.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
but
how
cost
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
opinion
of
the
court,
mr.
justice
complied
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
rule
58.
it
was
as
much
of
a
direction
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
would
like
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
--
to
say
first
of
all
that
that
is
a
different
case
from
ours
because
our
--
our
opinion
did
state
the
amount.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
it
does
say
that
the
plaintiff
sues
for
a
specific
sum
of
money.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
and
as
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
made
for
that
specific
sum
and
the
opinion
ends
with
the
words,
plaintiff's
motion
is
granted.
there
is
no
possible
interpretation
except
that
the
motion
was
being
granted
for
the
sum
in
suit.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
why,
simply
because
the
overall
policy
of
the
federal
rules
as
one
of
the
expeditious
entry
of
judgment
and
the
prosecution
of
the
field.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
of
course,
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
that
there
was
uncertainty
in
the
amount
in
this
case.
if
--
your
question
is
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
it
does
fix
the
amount
to
this
extent
that
it
states
the
precise
sum
for
which
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
we
--
we
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
--
say
as
the
judgment
does.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
yes,
sir.
we
are,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
we
think
that
the
short
opinion
in
this
case
was
the
judgment,
the
opinion
as
a
whole.
it
does
end
with
the
words
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
there
is
certainly
no
question
reading
the
memorandum
opinion
as
to
how
much
the
government
owed
to
plaintiff.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
well,
there
are
two
items
here.
first
of
all,
the
questions
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
oh,
i
think
it's
a
proper
notation
of
an
entry
of
judgment.
there
is
a
difference
between
what
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
what
constitutes
an
entry
of
judgment.
the
clerk's
docket
entry
was
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
the
judgment
itself.
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
the
statement
that
there
may
well
be
cases
where
it's
desirable
to
have
a
formalized
judgment.
but,
the
decision
as
to
what
those
cases
are
should
rest
with
the
court
and
it's
easy
enough
for
the
court
to
state
in
its
opinion
that
counsel
should
submit
a
form
of
judgment
for
the
court
to
consider.
in
this
complicated
cases
involving
computations,
it
may
well
be
that
that's
the
preferable
procedure.
but
it's
for
the
judge
to
decide
that
and
not
for
the
attorneys
and
if
in
fact,
the
judge
does
show
final
adjudication,
then
he
has
rendered
judgment.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
in
very
--
many
of
the
cases,
a
computation
is
necessary.
that
is
almost
always
apparent
from
the
case
itself.
certainly,
if
it
is
not
apparent,
the
attorney
should
bring
it
home
to
the
court
that
some
computation
is
necessary
and
the
court
can
be
guided
by
their
advice
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
necessary
to
have
a
formal
order.
in
the
second
circuit,
there
is
a
standard
practice
when
the
court
intends
to
have
a
party
submit
orders
for
the
judge's
signature.
the
word
settle
orders
are
comparable
language
are
used
where
the
court
does
not
intend
to
have
a
further
order
presented,
those
words
are
lacking.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
so
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
so,
i
was
--
i
was
just
going
to
conclude
that
in
those
cases
where
it
is
desirable
to
have
the
further
formalized
order,
there
is
an
appropriate
procedure
for
doing
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
why?
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
in
the
ordinary
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
they
are
nominal.i
know
--
know
cases
where
they're
really
sizable.
i
certainly
haven't
seen
any
where
they’ve
been
(inaudible).
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
the
printing
in
the
ordinary
case
is
--
is
not
taxable
as
part
of
the
cost
in
the
federal
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
they
would
be,
yes.
there
--
there
could
well,
be
cases
where
the
cost
are
--
are
substantial.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
like
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
difference
depending
on
how
large
cost
may
be
or
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
oh,
that
--
that’s
correct,
your
honor
and
it
does
show
that
every
judgment
so
far
as
execution
is
concerned
that
may
differ
from
the
ultimate
amount
that
may
be
recovered.
that's
true
of
interest,
too
where
interest
continues
to
run
after
the
date
to
which
it's
been
computed.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
interest
was
actually
computed
to
the
date
of
the
formal
entry
which
i
think
may
have
deprived
plaintiff
of
a
few
dollars
to
which
he
was
entitled
on
the
theory
that
subsequent
to
that
date,
interest
runs
on
interest
by
incorporating
interest
in
the
amount
of
principle
that
you
--
recovered
himself.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
no,
because
interest
continues
to
run
afterwards
and
if
you
have
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
--
interest
running
for
longer
period,
it
would
have
a
larger
principal
to
someone
which
in
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
it
--
it
would
be
a
--
it
could
vary
depending
on
how
long
afterwards
the
recovery
of
the
actual
payment
is
made.
it
could
be
greater
or
less
depending
on
--
on
the
time
of
law
in
--
in
minor
amounts.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
i
think
at
the
time
that
formal
judgment
was
submitted,
there
was
no
thought
of
this
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
it
was
lack
of
thought
rather
than
affirmative
thought.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
but
we
--
we
don't
contend
that
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
--
that
the
procedural
steps
--
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
but
we
would
like
to
--
thought
about
it
a
little.
mr.
thomas
c.
burke
well,
in
the
--
the
bedford
case
differed
from
this
in
that
it
was
an
appeal
or
certiorari
to
