and
the

writes
up
an
opinion,
it
says
on
the

then
the

made
it
with
some
clerk,
he
says,
"i
want
an

how
much
is
he
getting
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
about
–
do
you
go
behind
the
judgment
to
find
out
the
amount,
to
look
at
the
papers,
and
the
evidence,
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
have
to
depend
to
your
amount
on
the
judgment
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
via
of
course
a
motion
to
amend
nunc
pro
tunc,
i
suppose,
or
something
of
that
kind.
but
can
you
have
a
good
judgment
when
you
have
sued
for
a
certain
amount
either
in
court
or
here
and
the
judge
just
said,
judgment
for
plaintiffs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
an
entry
of
--
a
judgment
of
something
that
a
man
had
that
tells
him
he's
got
the
right
to
some
either
money,
an
injunction,
order
somebody
to
do
something.
what
order
was
made
here,
either
what
the
definite
thing
had
to
be
done?
how
can
you
say
there
is
a
judgment
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
rule
58
provide
that
hereafter,
a
judgment
need
--
never
state
the
amount
that
that
could
be
left
in
the
air
and
the
clerk
somehow
can
figure
that.

did
it
say
a
judgment

i
understand
it
said
that
and
he
could
say
that
in
a
court.
you
said,
he
sued
for
$5000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
a
man
have
to
appeal
from
the
judgment,
from
an
order
which
doesn't
state
that
he
–
how
much
he
is
to
pay
somebody
on
the
money
claimed?
why

why
would
his

you
claim
you're
entitled

for
a

amount,
made
the
most
into
the

you
call
it
some
kind
of
a
primary
entry
or
a
primary
entry
of
a
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
that,
expeditious
but
does
it
do
away
with
certainty
in
the
amount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
it
doesn't
have
to
appear
in
the
judgment.
whenever
--
whichever
the
judgment
was,
whether
it's
a
personal
(inaudible).
you
say
it's
a
good
judgment
even
though
it
doesn't
fix
the
amount.
justice

the
judgment
does?
justice
hugo

black
well,
i

i
--
justice

are
you
relying
on
the
whole
opinion

justice

of
the
judgment?
justice

what
then
--
well,
do
you
--
do
you
find
in
there
a
definite
statement
that
he
owed
a
certain
amount
from
--
from
the
judgment?
justice
hugo

you
do
not
rest
then
on
this

order
that
was
made
on

your

might
be
better
than
the
second.
[laughter]
justice
hugo

black
when
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
that
was
a
little
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
ask
you
one
more
question.
i
don't
know
if
it
has
anything
to
do
with
it
but
i'm
wondering
if
there
are
any
particular
statute
which
controlled
government
agents
in
the
payments
of
judgment
against
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
challenge
to
the
validity
of
that
regulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
an
idea
that
there
were
general
statutes
which
(inaudible)
considerably
in
the
payment
of
judgment
complying,
it
must
be
at
a
particular
(inaudible)
formal
judgment
of
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
--
that's
the
one
you
referred
to.
