justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
mr.
sand,
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you.
are
you
saying
the
clerk
has
the
discretion
as
to
whether
he
will
treat
the
court's
announcement
as
a
judgment
or
won't?
isn't
this
the
situation,
the
appeal
of
course
in
real
time
runs
from
the
date
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment?
this
is
an
action
for
the
recovery
of
money,
isn't
it?
rule
58
says
that
when
the
court
directs
that
a
party
recover
only
money
or
cost
or
that
all
right
be
denied,
the
clerk
shall
enter
judgment
forthwith
upon
receipt
of
the
direction.
now,
the
clerk
has
no
authority
to
enter
the
judgment
until
he
has
a
direction
to
do
so
from
the
court.
am
i
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
not
need
not
be
in
writing,
you
don't
insist,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
the
lower
court,
as
i
have
done
many
times,
simply
direct
the
clerk
from
the
bench
to
enter
a
specific
judgment.
isn't
that
good?
or
couldn't
i
do
the
same
thing
in
a
written
opinion
where
i
dispose
of
the
issue?
you've
been
writing
a
direction
to
the
clerk
down
to
the
same
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
verbal
announcement.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
correct.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
pursuant
to
that
direction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
local
rules
couldn't
affect
that,
could
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
you
contend
here
that
the
--
if
there
was
a
direction,
it
was
not
complete.
in
that
it
did
not
fix
the
date
from
upon
which
the
or
from
which
interest
would
accrue,
isn't
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
sand
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
just
one
brief
question.
i
know
--
i
hate
to
take
your
time.
but,
if
the
intention
has
anything
to
do
with
this,
the
intention
of
the
district
judge
does
not
the
fact
that
he
later,
after
pronouncing
orally
the
judgment
or
the
writing
of
his
opinion
later
enters
a
formal
entry
of
judgment
have
some
bearing
upon
the
fact
that
he
didn't
intend
his
first
pronouncement
to
be
the
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
in
other
words,
there
cannot
be
more
than
one
judgment,
is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
the
court
so
directs
the
clerk
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
appears
from
the
requirement
in
the
complaint?
does
it
require
the
dates
here,
some
requirement
from
the
complaint
whether
that
should
be
in
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
now,
if
it
is
in
there,
can
the
clerk
automatically
compute
the
interest?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
are
rather
sent
back
as
on
(inaudible)
because
i
guaranteed
from
the
oral
direction
of
the
clerk
--
the
court,
didn’t
the
clerk
enter
a
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
doesn’t
appeal.
the
appeal
was
premature.
you
have
to
await
the
entry
of
the
formal
entry
of
judgment.
and
i
--
that
the
--
the
type
of
thing
that
ought
to
be
settled
uniformly
throughout
the
country,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
roth?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
shouldn't
be
all
be
expeditious?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
rules
of
requirements.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
