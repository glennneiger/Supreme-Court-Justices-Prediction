mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
court
dismissed
the
government's
appeal
as
untimely
filed.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
this
was
a
suit
for
refund
of
taxes
and
the
taxpayer
moved
in
the
district
court
for
summary
judgment.
and
on
april
14th,
1955,
the
district
judge
granted
an
opinion
which
quoted
and
relied
upon
the
opinion
of
another
district
judge
in
another
case.
and
that
opinion
concluded
with
the
language
which
appears
on
page
4
of
the
record.
i
am
in
agreement
with
judge
leibell's
analysis
and
accordingly,
the
plaintiff's
motion
is
granted.
on
that
same
day,
the
clerk
of
the
court
made
an
entry
in
the
civil
docket
which
appears
at
the
top
of
page
2
of
the
record."april
14th,
rayfiel,
j.
decision
rendered
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
motion
granted.
see
opinion
on
file."
on
may
24,
1955,
the
district
judge
signed
a
paper
submitted
not
by
the
government
but
by
the
taxpayer
which
was
--
had
a
judgment
and
which
appears
on
pages
4
and
5
of
the
record.
that
document
after
--
reciting
that
the
court's
opinion
having
been
duly
filed
herein,
it
has
ordered
adjudged
and
decreed
that
the
plaintiff,
schaefer
brewing
company
recover
of
the
defendant
certain
sums
spelled
out
in
that
document.
the
document
was
stamped,
judgment
rendered,
dated
may
24,
1955.
and
on
that
date,
the
clerk
made
the
docket
entry
which
appears
on
page
2
of
the
record.
may
24,
rayfiel
j.
judgment
filed
and
docketed
against
defendant
in
various
sums
of
money
that
spelled
out.
the
government
filed
its
notice
of
appeal
on
july
21,
1955
which
was
98
days
from
the
original
grant
of
the
motion
from
the
decision
and
58
days
from
the
filing
of
the
judgment,
the
form
of
judgment
signed
on
may
24th.
the
taxpayer
moved
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
the
government's
appeal
as
not
timely
brought.
that
is
not
brought
within
60
days
from
the
entry
of
the
judgment
as
required
by
rule
73.
thus,
looking
at
pages
4
and
5
of
the
record,
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
granting
the
motion
was
in
and
of
itself
the
judgment
of
the
court,
the
final
disposition
by
the
district
judge
of
that
case.
or
whether
the
document
headed
in
a
stamped
judgment
dated
may
24th,
1955
submitted
by
the
taxpayer
and
signed
by
the
district
judge
constitutes
the
judgment
in
the
case.
and
the
second
issue,
looking
at
page
2
of
the
record
is
whether
the
april
14th
entry
decision
rendered
on
motion
for
summary
judgment
constitutes
an
entry
of
judgment,
a
docket
entry
of
judgment
which
contains
the
nature
and
substance
of
the
judgment
as
required
by
the
rules
to
begin
the
running
of
the
period
within
which
an
appeal
must
be
taken.
or
whether
the
may
24th
entry
is
the
applicable
judgment
entry.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
crucial
question
that
the
second
circuit
has
--
has
held
and
the
other
circuits
would
agree,
is
the
intent
of
the
--
of
the
district
judge.
and
to
some
extent
in
evaluating,
in
categorizing
the
words
used
by
the
district
judge
resort
has
had
to
local
practice.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
not.
i
think
that
one
says
--
let
me
make
that
clear.
i
think
that
there
is
now
an
explicit
conflict
between
the
second
circuit
and
the
first
circuit.
and
--
and
that
the
decision
below
is
also
inconsistent
with
decisions
reached
in
the
fourth
and
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
that
these
circuits
disagree
as
to
the
interpretation
of
rule
58.
subsequent
to
the
decision
in
the
schaefer
case,
the
first
circuit
in
united
states
against
higginson
reached
a
result
which
it
recognized
was
inconsistent
with
the
second
circuit's
result.
the
first
circuit
said
that
where
the
district
judge
later
signs
a
formal
order
that
becomes
relevant
in
determining
whether
he
intended
the
first
memorandum
decision
to
be
his
final
disposition
in
the
case.
and
referring
to
the
schaefer
opinion
said
that
that
was
influenced
by
a
local
rule.
subsequent
thereto,
the
second
circuit
decided
the
matteson
case
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
and
in
that
opinion,
judge
clark
said,
"no,
the
local
rule
merely
corroborates
rule
58
and
this
--
our
decision
is
based
on
--
on
rule
58."
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
you
--
you
look
to
the
words
and
--
and
you
look
also
the
words
used
by
the
district
judge
and
you
look
also
to
the
rules
of
--
of
civil
procedure
which
of
course
a
uniform
throughout
the
country
to
see
whether
those
words
satisfy
the
requirements
set
forth
in
the
rules.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there
is
a
clear
conflict
between
the
circuits
which
is
in
no
sense
dependent
on
any
local
rule
of
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i--
i
know
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
it
goes
on
to
say
mr.
justice
harlan
that
nothing
in
that
rule
will
prevent
the
district
judge
from
settling
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
a
more
formal
order
which
--
which
in
fact
the
district
judge
did
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it's
--
exactly
so.
and
--
and
so
the
decision
stands
as
an
interpretation
of
rule
--
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
apart
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
certain
that
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think,
no.
i
think
that
--
that
it's
clear
under
the
rules
of
as
--
as
they
now
exist
that
if
the
decision
of
the
district
judge
satisfied
the
requisites
of
a
judgment
and
by
that
--
and
we
take
those
requisites
to
be
that
it
contained
judgment
language
that
language
which
will
clearly
indicate
to
the
lay
personnel
of
the
clerk
or
clerk's
office
that
it
is
to
be
the
judgment.
and
if
it
goes
on
to
state
the
--
the
amount
of
the
recovery,
the
--
if
it
tells
what
a
judgment
must
tell,
who
is
to
pay
what
to
whom
and
the
money
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
if
that
had
been
the
case
and
had
the
clerk
made
a
--
an
entry
in
the
docket
which
satisfied
a
rule
79
indicating
the
nature
and
substance
of
the
judgment
then
--
then
the
time
to
appeal
would
begin
to
run
from
the
time
of
that
entry.
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
government
does
not
take
the
view
that
--
that
the
document
which
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
cannot
also
serve
as
the
judgment
of
the
court
if
it
contains
the
essential
elements
of
the
judgment,
which
is
as
i
say,
if
it
contains
language
which
directs
the
use
of
language
of
the
rule
directs
the
clerk
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
recover
the
money
and
if
it
spells
out
the
--
the
essential
elements
of
a
judgment,
who
is
to
pay
what
to
whom.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
i
--
i
think
not.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
if
this
court
reverses
and
says,
no,
the
opinion
of
april
14th
did
not
constitute.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
then
the
rule
would
be
for
the
future.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
that
for
an
opinion,
the
document
which
also
serves
as
the
opinion
to
constitute
the
judgment
of
the
court
for
it
to
serve
those
purposes,
it
must
contain
two
elements
which
the
opinion
in
this
case
did
not
contain.
it
was
contained,
one,
a
direction
to
the
clerk
operative
language
not
merely
plaintiff's
motion
is
granted
which
is
--
which
is
opinion
language.
these
--
the
entries
have
to
made
by
--
by
court
clerks.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
there
are
--
there
are
two
elements
in
your
--
your
remarks
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
i'm
not
clear
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
it
could
not
provide
that
in
opinion
which
i
suppose
one
could
conceive
of
a
rule
which
would
say
hereafter,
whenever
a
district
court
opinion
ends
a
motion
granted
and
if
the
opinion
states
the
--
all
the
requisites
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
the
judgment,
that
will
be
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
they
--
they
could.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
in
which
case
there
would
be
a
change
in
--
in
the
practice
as
it
--
as
its
invasion
by
the
schaefer
decision.
there
would
--
there
would
not
really
be
a
continuation
of
--
of
the
result
that
we
see
reflected
in
schaefer
because
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
they
could
do
that.
but
i
think
they
would
also
have
to
say
before
the
date
of
the
opinion
will
be
the
date
of
the
judgment.
it
must
comply
with
the
rules
and
it
must
indicate
that
it
is
to
be
a
judgment
and
it
must
contain
the
essential
elements
in
the
judgment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
but
i
don't
think
that
the
judge
in
this
case
did
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
they
could
not
do
that.
the
government
concedes
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
presumption
will
--
should
be
that
a
case
will
be
terminated
in
a
form
of
judgment.
we
concede
that
under
the
rules
as
they
now
stand,
there
is
not
a
need
in
every
case
for
a
separate
document
to
be
had
at
formal
judgment
that
it
is
possible
under
the
rules
for
the
document
which
is
the
opinion
also
to
serve
as
the
formal
judgment.
if
in
fact
it
contains
the
elements
which
--
which
we
regard
as
essential
to
a
judgment
a
direction
for
the
clerk
and
an
indication
of
who
is
to
pay
what
to
whom.
if
--
if
the
opinion
is
so
clear
that
--
that
it
is
to
be
treated
as
a
judgment
and
in
fact
the
clerk
regards
it
as
a
judgment
and
makes
the
--
a
judgment
entry
then
there
is
--
is
no
need,
we
conceive,
for
a
separate
document.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
but
--
it
could
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
you
could
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
--
and
if
--
if
it
was
a
direction
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
if
the
opinion
or
other
document
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
in
which
that
direction
was
embodied.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
or
verbal
announcement,
had
all
the
requisites
of
the
judgment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
the
clerk
made
a
notation
in
the
docket
which
contains
a
nature
in
substance
of
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
then
--
then
the
time
to
appeal
would
begin
to
run
from
that
entry.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
this
would
--
this
would
be
under
the
--
under
the
federal
rules.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
that
--
that
it
contained
--
it
lacked
the
direction.
it
merely
has
the
--
the
general
language
motion
is
granted
and
also
it
did
not
say
who
was
to
pay
what
to
whom.
it
was
impossible
looking
at
the
four
corners
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
judge
in
this
case
to
determine
the
exact
amount
which
was
the
plaintiff
was
to
recover
of
the
defendant.
and
--
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
opinion
did
not
satisfy
the
requisites
of
a
judgment.
and
--
and
we
also
think
that
the
entry
of
the
clerk
which
did
not
even
indicate
which
party
had
prevailed
below
on
april
14th
was
not
an
entry
of
the
--
which
indicated
the
nature
and
substance
of
a
judgment
which
the
rules
require.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
the
only
definition
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
only
definition
of
judgment
is
in
rule
54
(a)
and
it
is
as
your
honor
stated.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
with
--
envisions
a
document
which
will
culminate
the
litigation.
a
--
a
document
which
will
apprise
the
parties
of
--
of
what
the
consequences
of
the
decision
below
has
been
and
we
think
that
one
of
the
evils
of
--
of
--
of
the
--
the
decision
below
is
that
it
treated
an
opinion
which
did
not
do
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
as
to
judgment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
know
nothing
in
the
rules
that
would
prevent
a
particular
circuit
from
saying
when
a
district
judge
determines
a
motion,
he
shall
also
enter
judgment
--
indicate
the
judgment
in
that
case
by
directing
the
clerk
to
--
by
directing
that
the
party
recover
and
spelling
out
the
exact
amount.
but
the
difficulty
that
arises
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
in
--
in
some
cases,
particularly
in
tax
cases,
the
--
let
me
--
if
i
may
present
a
hypothetical.
suppose
the
issue
is
whether
a
particular
transaction
resulted
in
income
in
1941
and
1952
or
was
--
or
was
a
gift
or
not
a
sale.
the
district
court
may
in
an
opinion
indicate
how
the
various
transactions
are
to
be
treated.
but
the
computation
which
must
follow
thereafter
becomes
an
extended
process.
if
--
if
under
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
that's
right.
but
if
--
if
the
opinion
does
not
leave
unanswered
only
matters
which
can
be
ministerially
handled
and
is
accorded
a
judgment
--
the
status
of
judgment
which
--
which
schaefer
indicates
would
be
the
case,
then
the
time
to
appeal
might
begin
to
run
or
even
expire
before
the
parties
knew
who
was
to
pay
what
to
whom.
and
--
and
as
mr.
justice
whitaker
indicated,
the
opinion
of
the
district
judge
below
did
not
indicate
one
of
the
crucial
elements
in
determining
what
the
consequences
of
this
judgment
would
be.
he
did
not
indicate
the
date
on
which
the
taxpayer
paid
his
taxes.
and
under
the
applicable
statute,
interest
runs
from
that
date
of
payment.
so,
if
that
have
been
possible
for
the
clerks
in
this
case
from
the
--
within
the
four
points
as
of
the
opinion
itself
to
have
determine
the
amount
--
the
amount
of
the
judgment.
they
would
have
to
go
beyond
that
to
the
pleadings
and
to
the
answer
and
submit
that
the
--
the
function
of
a
judgment
is
--
is
--
is
to
be
a
document
which
culminates
the
litigation
and
which
presents
in
that
one
collection
of
words,
the
--
the
consequences
of
the
litigation.

think

mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
under
the
--
under
the
practices
of
--
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think,
no.
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
it
--
the
writ
of
execution
must
be
for
a
--
a
specific
sum
which
must
be
spelled
out.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
--
as
we
show
in
our
reply
brief,
the
taxpayer
who
now
says
that
the
formal
judgment
was
a
useless
thing,
could
not
have
been
paid
unless
he
had
a
document
which
spelled
out
the
amount
of
the
recovery.
but
the
suit
was
brought
not
to
obtain
an
opinion
but
to
obtain
the
payment
of
money
and
without
--
without
going
beyond
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
securing
this
formal
document
--
this
document
which
said
who
was
to
pay
what
to
whom,
the
taxpayer
could
not
have
--
have
received
its
money.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
it
has
--
it's
crucial.
and
the
first
circuit
agrees
and
the
fourth
and
the
ninth
circuit
agrees.
and
--
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
hark
is
to
the
same
effect.
one
shouldn't
presume
that
the
district
judge
in
later
signing
the
formal
order
performed
a
useless
act
or
an
act
intended
improperly
to
extend
the
time
--
the
time
for
appeal.
i
think
that
--
that
that
--
that
in
determining
intent,
of
course
we
should
look
to
what
the
--
what
the
district
judge
later
did.
i
think
there's
--
i
think
that
court
congestion
need
not
result
from
a
--
a
reversal
of
the
decision
below.
it
is
always
available
to
the
district
judge.
if
he
does
not
have
before
him
the
necessary
information
to
--
to
enter
a
--
a
document
which
contains
the
requisites
of
a
judgment
to
prescribe
the
time
within
which
the
parties
must
do
that,
he
can
still
retain
control.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
the
only
reason
we
--
we
refer
to
retention
is
because
the
variety
--
there's
a
variety
of
words
which
may
be
used
that
--
and
words
have
--
in
interpreting
words,
one
--
one
frequently
lead
us
to
retention.
we
think
the
consequence
of
the
decision
below
will
be
the
--
in
many
cases
rather
than
eliminating
another
document
of
formal
judgment.
there
will
be
two
judgments,
one
of
which
will
measure
the
time
for
appeal,
one
of
which
will
be
necessary
to
secure
execution,
to
secure
payment
to
record
the
judgment
to
obtain
a
lien
in
--
in
the
state
courts.
nothing
in
the
federal
rules
suggest
that
there
should
be
more
than
one
judgment
and
the
result
we
think
needs
--
leads
to
ambiguities
and
confusions.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
it's
implicit
throughout
the
rules
and
in
the
whole
concept
of
a
judgment
that
it
is
a
single
document
which
--
which
culminates
the
litigation
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
as
to
whether
writ
of
execution
could
be
--
could
be
obtained.
i
--
i
agree
with
mr.
burke
that
further
proceedings
would
have
been
necessary
before
execution
could
have
been
obtained
and
it
could
not
have
been
obtained
merely
on
this
opinion.
and
i
suggest
that
further
proceedings
that
would
have
been
necessary
would
have
been
mandamus
to
compel
the
district
judge
to
sign
a
document
which
contains
the
elements
that
are
found
in
the
formal
judgment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
even
if
you
can,
it
was
not
done
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
certainly
in
the
april
14th
entry.
and
secondly,
within
the
four
corners
of
the
opinion,
you
could
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
in
this
case
have
calculated
the
amount.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
cite
in
the
--
in
our
reply
brief
to
page
5,
the
treasury
regulations
which
applied
at
the
time
--
the
district
court
rendered
its
decision
in
schaefer
and
the
construction
of
those
by
the
internal
revenue
service
and
they
would
not
have
made
payment
unless
they
were
submitted
to
them
a
document
which
contained
the
exact
amount
of
the
recovery.
and
so,
the
taxpayer
was
qualified
in
this
case
to
have
secured
the
additional
document
high
insider
or
not
because
without
such
a
document,
it
could
never
had
been
paid.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
there
was
one
--
which
applied
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case
that
the
prospect
of
the
possibility
of
the
taxpayer
going
to
the
internal
revenue
service
with
this
opinion
to
obtain
payment
is
what
is
on
the
(inaudible).
