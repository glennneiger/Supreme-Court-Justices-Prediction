excuse.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
any
other
circuit
that
have
local
rule
10
that
they
have
in
the
southern
district
and
the
eastern
district?
justice

m.
harlan
local
rule
10
in
effect
says
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
to
be
deemed
the
order,
right?

judge
hartigan
distinguished
in
the
higginson
case,
the
schaefer
case
on
the
basis
of
the
local
rule
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
schaefer
case
was
intended
to
mean
more
than
the
reliance
on
a
local
rule.
they
disagreed
with
it
in
the
first
circuit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
judge
clark
came
back
and
said
that
local
rule
didn't
have
any
independent
force,
it
was
of
the
confirmatory
of
what
the
second
circuit
understood
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
be,
isn't
that
the
wording?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
they
couldn't
do
that
if
we
interpreted
the
federal
rule
is
requiring
a
separate
instrument
entitled
to
a
judgment,
could
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
thought
you
had
a
judgment
by
virtue
of
judge
rayfiel's
opinion,
why
did
you
submit
a
judgment
for
signature?

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
that
(voice

every
careful
law
office
does.
i
can't
remember
a
case
that
i
had
where
i
didn't
follow
and
particularly
if
i
wanted,
by
a
formal
judgment.
