mr.

justice
william
j.
brennan,

go
ahead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sands,
may
i
--
do
i
correctly
infer
from
what
you
have
said
about
the
determination
of
several
circuits
that
none
of
them
has
suggested
that
without
regard
to
the
attempt
of
the
district
judge,
there
was
no
judgment
until
a
formal
paper
captioned
judgment
is
entered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
mean
--
what
i
mean
is,
has
it
been
suggested
by
anyone
that
you
don't
have
a
judgment
until
there's
a
formal
judgment
entered,
in
other
words,
that
you
can't
spell
a
judgment
merely
out
of
a
docket
entry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
but
here,
it
had
said
at
the
end
of
the
opinion,
the
district
judge
have
said,
"i
adjudge
and
decree
that
there
shall
be
recovered
by
the
plaintiff
from
the
united
states
x
dollars."
that
would
have
satisfied
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
government
doesn't
take
a
different
view
of
the
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
burke
this
question.
as
i
recall
it,
the
clerk
stamped
the
--
the
formal
judgment,
would
he
not,
with
a
stamp
which
judgment
entered
the
day
of
may
24
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
indication
that
to
him
at
least,
the
judgment
was
the
formal
document
that
he
so
stamps
and
that
the
notation
that
he
made
was
not
a
judgment
in
response
to
any
direction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
--
just
from
the
face
of
it,
the
stamp
is
that
judgment
entered,
(inaudible)
may
24th,
1955,
(inaudible),
clerk.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
rule
itself
contemplates
that
there's
no
judgment
although
there's
--
such
action
taken
by
the
clerk,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
rule
says
that
the
--
the
clerk
shall
enter
the
judgment
forthwith
upon
receipt
by
him
of
the
direction.
and
they
gather
that
at
least
--
certainly
it's
permissible
entrance
from
what
he
did
down
the
formal
document
that
he
thought
within
response
to
his
--
the
direction,
this
was
the
judgment
entered
on
that
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
even
though
he
didn't
think
he
was
doing
it.
and
assuming
that
that
have
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
he
didn't
think
he
was,
nevertheless,
the
notation
he
made,
motion
granted
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
look
at
that.
all
that
he
did
on
april
14th,
was
that
the
note,
rayfiel,
j.
decision
rendered
on
motion
for
summary
judgment.
motion
granted.see
opinion
on
file.
that’s
all
he
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
same
with
what
i've
told
you
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
for
me,
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
seem
that
--
it
been
--
that
information
to
you
because
you
later
submitted
a
formal
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
with
the
case
here,
mr.
burke,
was
interest
computed
to
the
date
of
the
form
--
entry
of
the
formal
judgment
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
--
(inaudible)
--
and
this
one
is
to
the
date
of
may
24th
which
was
the
date
of
the
formal
judgment
presented
not
merely
the
april
14,
the
date
of
the
judgment
decision,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn’t
deprive
himself
of
anything,
get
something
more
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
until
the
date
of
(voice
overlap)
of
the
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he'd
waited
another
couple
of
months,
you
mean,
it's
been
a
larger
