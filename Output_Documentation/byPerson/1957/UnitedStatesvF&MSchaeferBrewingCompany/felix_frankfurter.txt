justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
may
i
ask
at
the
outset,
in
order
to
appreciate
the
reach
of
this
--
does
the
--
in
the
problem
of
this
kind,
appreciate
the
general
problem,
but
does
the
specific
setting
in
which
the
problem
arises
in
the
second
circuit
raised
the
question
for
all
the
other
circuits
or
other
variations
in
the
different
circuits
regarding
the
practice
of
what
they
do
about,
what
they
say
when
they
file
opinions
and
make
docket
entries
thereon
and
then
later
there's
a
later
entry.
what
is
(inaudible)?
what
is
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
this
question
may
not
--
this
--
you
--
one
cannot
say
that
this
raises
that
question
of
statutory
construction
which
will
hereafter
govern
every
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
that.
i
only
let
you
--
see
what
you
have
to
say
but
if
the
thing
turns
on
intent
--
intent,
maybe
what
the
district
judge
manage
to
do,
what
he
sought
to
be
accomplished,
then
one
either
has
to
say
that
you
look
for
nothing
but
the
word
and
they
must
mean
the
same
thing
in
whatever
circuit
they
arise
or
if
its
other
things
--
other
understanding
except
words,
then
that's
(inaudible),
you
must
have
local
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
may
get
--
one
gets
lost
in
words
in
this
problem.
i
rely
on
words
for
the
--
for
the
proposition
obvious
enough
that
while
no
local
rule
can
change
the
terms
of
the
legislation
or
that
the
statute
of
congress
or
the
rules
adopted
not
changed
by
congress.
statutory
standard
cannot
be
changed
by
local
practice
but
local
practice
may
determine
whether
the
standard
is
satisfying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
bedford
case,
for
--
even
for
all
the
purposes
of
our
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
tomorrow,
if
this
court
sustained
--
if
we
sustain
the
government's
claim
in
this
case
to
theirs,
our
judgment
comes
down,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
can
effectuate
its
present
rule
by
--
by
providing
for
its
own
rules
that
that
what
was
done
on
april
14th
to
be
final
and
nothing
more
shall
be
entered,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case,
i'm
talking
about
the
future.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
of
that
could
be
direct
--
well
then,
tell
me
why
i
am
wrong.
i
am
not
saying
that
that
makes
any
difference
but
i
just
want
to
see
what
we're
going
to
do
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong
in
thinking
that
if
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
to
stay,
the
second
circuit
can
continue
what
it
conceives
to
be
its
lawful
present
practice
by
--
so
provided
so
that
by
then
--
and
furthermore,
i
don't
think
i
agree
with
you
that
an
incorporation
by
a
reference
in
the
prior
decision
doesn't
tell
you
what
the
decision
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
assume
--
don't
--
go
into
that
--
go
into
the
--
assume
the
opinion
satisfies
the
--
the
particularity
required
by
the
rules.
according
to
the
second
circuit
tomorrow
in
futuro
provide
for
it
to
continue
into
this
present
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
could
agree
upon
that
when
they
lunched
together.
those
judges
do
in
the
second
circuit
that
hereafter,
whenever
they
do
that,
the
opinion
should
set
forth
with
particularity,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
they
could
make
the
date
of
the
appeal
run
from
the
days
that
the
judge
decides
that
he
thought
definitively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
for
the
district
judge
to
do
that
on
april
14th?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
it's
very
difficult
for
judges
to
do
that
hereafter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
--
i'm
not
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
consequence
of
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
the
questions
that's
involved
here,
as
to
whether
the
rules
does
require
a
separate
instrument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
am
i
right
in
--
in
reading
the
--
the
rules,
the
federal
rules
as
defining
a
judgment
not
intrinsically
but
functionally.
it's
the
basis
on
which
an
appeal
lie,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
function
that
it
said,
mainly,
it's
the
last
step
in
the
process
so
that
you
can
go
up
to
the
higher
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
rules
that
prevents
a
particular
circuit
in
the
interest
of
expediting
appeals
in
arresting
that
great
evil
in
american
litigation
dilatory
to
provide
that
it
should
all
be
done
on
the
final
day,
in
one
act.
the
judge
should
hand
on
an
opinion,
that
he
writes
an
opinion
as
he
should
in
all
but
exceptional
cases.
and
then
in
there
translates
that
opinion
into
a
final
document
for
purposes
of
going
upstairs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
anything
but
a
ministerial
process.of
course,
it
can't
be
anything
but
a
ministerial
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
clerk
can
fill
out
that
he
can't
do
anything
except
an
arithmetic
or
what
i
call
a
ministerial
thing.
otherwise,
you're
transferring
the
judicial
functions
to
the
clerk's
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
suggest
or
agree
that
intention
is
the
determining
thing.
why
should
we
--
isn't
that
a
confusing
and
a
disturbing
test
to
apply?
we're
not
saying,
why
not
go
after
what
is
essential
mainly?
whether
the
particular
situation,
the
particular
piece
of
paper,
the
particular
entry
is
or
is
not
a
finality
of
the
process
so
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned
as
a
basis
of
going
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
is
concerned
for
coming
here,
for
being
allowed
to
come
here.
why
is
that
--
why
do
we
have
to
constantly
invoke
that
cloudy
search
intention
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
disregard
the
intention.
i
should
pick
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
--
of
the
circuit
is
the
best
and
most
authoritative
voice
as
to
what
is
intended
and
yet
it's
disregarded
here?
why
do
we
disregard
it?
because
the
objective
circumstances
as
you
argue
don't
satisfy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
depends
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
any
of
these
opinions
to
which
you
refer
give
any
history
beyond
whet
judge
clark
gave
in
his
opinion?
as
to
the
origin
of
it
and
the
consideration
of
it,
and
things
that
move
those
judges?
they
were
after
all
have
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
of
these
matters
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
there
to
be
such
a
rule
and
to
sanction
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
that
came
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
on
that
point.
yes,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
my
self,
i
don't
see
why
one
circuit
shouldn’t
be
more
expeditious
than
another.
i
can't
understand
why
that
should
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
meant
--
the
notion
of
how
to
expedite
differ,
which
is
a
large
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
burke
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
costs,
do
the
--
what
is
the
range
of
cost
of
litigation
in
the
southern
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sometimes
sizeable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
asked
that
question
is
because
that
the
rule
provide
with
the
entry
of
judgment
shall
not
await
taxation
of
cost.
but
you
can
have
a
judgment
which
is
leviable
in
which
you
can
get
execution
all
over
the
total
amount
recoverable
is
not
yet
ascertained,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
either
but
you
may
have
a
case
in
which
as
justice
whittaker
suggest.
the
cost
may
amount
to
something,
at
least
to
some
litigants
who
aren't
multimillionaires
and
yet,
is
that
a
judgment
on
which
execution
for
the
basis
of
which
you
can
get
execution
but
you
haven't
got
execution
for
all
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
note
that
you
say
to
the
government
you're
another
because
they
argued
it,
to
borrow
this
court's
from
years
ago
that
the
opinion
was
a
judgment.
for
purposes
of
this
very
kind
of
a
question,
bedford
stated
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
yes,
i
know
but
the
question
is
to
say
what
you
can
do
whether
90
days
means
90
days
from
what
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
suggesting,
the
government
thought
an
opinion
when
the
judgment
was
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
a
hard
time
to
disapprove
that
the
government
was
right,
to
prove
the
government
was
right,
isn’t
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
answer
--
that
answer
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
a
specific
figure
in
the
judges'
opinions
are
not
to
be
deemed
incorporated
in
the
judgment,
i.e.
the
entry
of
april
14th
that
that's
really
at
the
heart
of
this
business,
to
what
extent
you
can
incorporate
in
an
informal
statement
to
formalize
terms
and
statement
of
the
judges'
opinion.
if
--
if
--
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
emphasized
it
maybe,
if
in
this
case,
there
isn’t
any
doubt
as
to
the
mathematical
computation
which
followed
the
amount
for
which
recovery
could
be
had
and
the
judge
says,
"yes,
you
can
recover
what
you
asked
for,
$6000,
whatever
it
is."
it's
just
like
a
bill
in
equity
for
specific
performance
in
which
you
asked
for
the
delivery
of
a
(inaudible)
and
the
judge
says
"yes."
that's
the
--
the
bill
for
specific
performance
is
granted
and
the
(inaudible)
should
be
delivered.
now,
i
--
you
can't
incorporate
that
in
the
formalized
statement
of
a
--
of
a
clerk's
entry.
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
