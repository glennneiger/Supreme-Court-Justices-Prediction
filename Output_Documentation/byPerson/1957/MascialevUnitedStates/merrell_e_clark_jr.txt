mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
court
had
affirmed
by
a
divided
court
the
petitioner's
conviction
of
violation
of
the
narcotics
laws.
the
particular
statutes
involved
are
listed
on
page
2
of
petitioner's
brief
and
are
printed
in
the
appendix,
but
they
do
not
raise
the
question
which
is
really
at
issue
here.
petitioner
was
tried
by
a
jury
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
and
was
convicted
of
unlawfully
selling
and
conspiring
to
sell
an
ounce
and
a
quarter
of
heroin
hydrochloride.
he
received
a
three-year
sentence.
upon
appeal,
a
counsel
was
assigned
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
through
the
new
york
legal
aid
society.
now,
the
fact
is
that
petitioner
did
participate
in
that
narcotic
sale.
that
participation
is
freely
conceded
here
and
was
freely
conceded
on
the
trial.
the
defense
was
that
of
entrapment.
in
other
words,
the
particular
sale
of
narcotics
in
which
petitioner
participated
was
induced
by
a
federal
agent.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
trial
court
erred
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury,
when
the
undisputed
facts
showed,
first,
the
inducement
by
the
document;
second,
the
petitioner
had
not
previously
dealt
in
narcotics,
or
in
fact
that
he
was
not
a
user
of
narcotics;
third,
that
the
urging
of
the
government
agents
had
continued
for
a
period
of
over
two
months
before
the
petitioner
actually
committed
the
illegal
act
and
fourth,
whether
the
government
failed
to
produce
any
evidence
whatsoever
of
the
inducements
first
offered
to
the
petitioner
and
his
response
thereto.
now,
before
turning
to
the
facts
i
would
just
like
mention
one
decision
of
this
court
as
a
sort
of
background
to
the
facts
that
is
the
case
of
sorrells
versus
united
states,
287
u.s.
435
(1932).
i
mention
it,
because
it
is
to
my
knowledge
the
only
occasion
on
which
this
court
has
spoken
on
the
defense
of
entrapment,
and
most
of
what
i
will
say
refers
to
that
case
as
the
touchstone.
in
that
case
this
court
first
held
that
entrapment
was
a
valid
defense,
and
the
court
said
the
controlling
question,
the
controlling
question
is,
whether
the
defendant
is
a
person,
otherwise
innocent,
whom
the
government
is
seeking
to
punish
for
an
alleged
offense
which
is
the
product
of
the
creative
activity
of
its
officials?
now,
the
facts
are
these.
the
narcotic
sale
we
are
concerned
with
took
place
in
brooklyn
on
march
2,
1954.
the
purchaser
is
a
man
name
marshall,
who
was
a
government
agent.
the
actual
seller
was
never
apprehended.
he
dealt
with
marshall
on
the
telephone,
he
was
never
identified,
and
the
government
never
succeeded
in
catching
him.
marshall
dealt
through
a
middleman,
a
man
named
seifert.
i
am
sorry
to
bother
you
with
all
this
dramatic
personae,
but
it
is
important,
a
man
named
seifert
who
introduced
agent
marshall
to
the
seller
over
the
telephone
and
who
led
agent
marshall
to
the
empty
lot,
where
the
ounce
and
a
quarter
of
heroin
had
been
lodged.
now,
petitioner's
role
in
the
transaction
was
to
introduce
marshall,
the
government
agent,
to
seifert,
the
middleman,
and
that
is
virtually
all
he
had
to
do
for
the
transaction.
the
story
begins
chronologically
in
december
1953,
approximately
three
months
before
the
sale
took
place
when
one
kowel
appeared
in
agent
marshall's
office
and
applied
for
employment
as
someone
familiar
with
the
narcotics
business.
agent
marshall
testified
that
he
hired
kowel
as
a
special
employee,
paid
him
on
an
informal
basis.
kowel
would
come
in
and
say
he
had
spent
five
or
ten
dollars
in
a
bar
the
night
before
and
marshall
would
reimburse
him.
but
there
has
been
no
contention
as
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
kowel
was
anything
but
an
agent
of
the
government.
kowel
was
also,
and
had
been
for
some
years,
a
friend
of
the
defendant.
shortly
after
kowel's
employment
by
agent
marshall,
he
suggested
to
the
defendant
that
the
defendant
enter
the
narcotics
business.
he
pointed
out
to
the
defendant
that
there
was
a
lot
of
money
to
be
made
in
the
narcotics
business.
the
defendant,
as
he
testified,
kowel
himself
did
not
testify,
and
the
only
knowledge
we
have
as
to
this
early
stage
of
the
story
comes
from
the
defendant.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
the
defendant,
your
honor,
so
far
as
the
record
showed,
i
believe
the
record
doesn't
show
what
his
business
was,
he
actually
had
worked
on
the
waterfront,
had
been
a
truck
driver,
he
had
two
convictions
for
gambling
and
one
conviction
for
conspiracy
to
attempt
to
commit
a
robbery.
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
whatsoever,
and
i
believe
it's
not
contended
that
he
had
ever
dealt
in
narcotics
previously.
the
defendant
testified,
as
i
say
his
testimony
was
uncontradicted,
that
he
in
the
first
instance
rejected
these
suggestions.
he
told
kowel
he
wanted
no
part
in
the
narcotics
business,
but
kowel
was
persistent,
repeated
his
suggestion
on
two
or
three
separate
occasions
and
finally
urged
the
defendant
to
meet
a
big
buyer
of
narcotics
from
texas,
whom
kowel
was
going
to
introduce
him
to.
well,
again,
the
defendant
resisted
the
suggestion,
but
in
the
end
he
consented
to
meet
the
big
buyer
from
texas.
the
meeting
took
place
in
brooklyn
on
january
14,
and
as
the
court
has
no
doubt
surmised,
the
big
buyer
from
texas
was
agent
marshall,
and
marshall
asked
the
defendant
if
he
could
locate
a
source
of
narcotics.
marshall
testified
as
to
this
meeting.
his
testimony
in
substance
was
that
the
defendant
was
willing,
expressed
willingness
to
try
to
locate
a
source
of
narcotics
for
him,
boasted
that
in
his
gambling
contacts
he
had
known
in
the
past
at
least
of
people
who
were
in
the
narcotics
business.
but
he
told
marshall
and
marshall
so
testified
that
he
did
not
know
right
then
any
source
of
narcotics,
but
he
undertook
to
try
to
find
the
source.
then
his
testimony,
which
of
course,
i
think,
we
must
assume
the
jury
disbelieved
that
he
was
just
stringing
marshall
along,
but
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
this
review
we
must
assume
that
he
was
actually
at
that
point
willing
to
find
a
source
of
narcotics
for
the
buyer
from
texas.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
he
was
asked,
your
honor,
i
think
on
direct,
i
don't
recall.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir
and
he
was
and
he
testified,
he
had
never
dealt
with
narcotics
and
never
used
narcotics.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
oh
no,
not
as
to
that,
your
honor.
i
say
no.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
they
might
have
disregarded
it,
but
if
they
disregard
that,
they
are
left
with
the
case
where
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
as
to
whether
the
man
ever
had
or
had
not
dealt
with
narcotics.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
that's
my
position.
now,
following
this
meeting
of
january
14,
there
ensued
a
period
of
approximately
six
weeks
during
which
the
defendant
undertook
to
locate
a
source
of
narcotics
for
the
buyer
from
texas.
agent
marshall
testified
that
he
spoke
to
the
defendant
during
that
period
perhaps
ten
times,
two
or
three
of
which
were
in
person,
about
among
other
things
the
defendant's
inability
to
locate
a
source
of
narcotics.
finally
however,
the
defendant
did
locate
a
source
of
narcotics
and
on
march
1,
he
introduced
agent
marshall
to
the
middleman
seifert.
seifert
then
introduced
marshall
to
the
seller
and
the
transaction
took
place.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
the
evidence
on
that
score,
your
honor,
is
this,
seifert
pleaded
guilty
and
tuned
state's
evidence
and
both
he
and
the
defendant
testified
that
they
had
not
known
each
other
on
january
14,
that
is
at
the
time
when
the
defendant
was
first
approached
by
marshall
to
find
a
source
of
narcotics.
they
testified
they
have
known
each
other
about
a
month
prior
to
march
1
and
they
testified
both
that
the
first
time
the
defendant
mentioned
seifert
the
possibility
of
selling
narcotics
was
march
1,
the
very
day
when
the
defendant
introduced
seifert
to
marshall.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
first
approach
by
kowel
was,
we
contend,
and
it
was
conceded
a
government
agent,
was
either
late
december
or
early
january.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
there
is
not
evidence
whatsoever
that
he
had
any
relations
with
the
source
he
ultimately
located.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
mean
to
be
and
i
anticipate
another
question.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
the
next
question
is,
that
the
only
evidence
that
he
had
any
connection
at
all
ever
with
any
source
of
narcotics
was
marshall's
testimony
that
at
their
first
meeting
on
january
14,
petitioner
said
in
the
past,
in
his
gambling
activities,
he
had
known
people
in
narcotics.
he
no
longer
knew
those
people,
but
he
would
try
to
find
a
source
for
marshall.
that's
the
story.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
sir,
the
allowable
evidence
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes,
that
he
had
contacts.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
the
allowable
evidence
sir,
i
think
is
no
more
than
this,
that
he
did
meet
seifert
around
february
1.
we
don't
know
exactly
how.
they
were
introduced
by
a
mutual
friend
in
a
restaurant,
but
narcotics
both
of
them
said
were
not
discussed.
there
is
then
a
hiatus
until
march
1,
when
the
defendant
ran
into
seifert,
brought
up
the
question
of
narcotics.
seifert
indicated
that
he
had
a
source
and
the
defendant
right
then
and
there
arranged
a
meeting
between
marshall
and
seifert.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
don't
know
of
anything,
your
honor,
and
the
government
hasn't
suggested
anything.
now,
i
mentioned
that
the
defendant
had
other
convictions,
two
for
gambling
and
one
for
conspiracy
to
commit
robbery.
the
court
below
didn't
refer
to
those
as
in
any
way
significant,
apparently
because
they
are
so
unrelated
to
the
narcotics
field
as
perhaps
not
to
indicate
any
predisposition
to
sell
narcotics.
now
i
will
return
once
again
to
the
sorrells'
case,
because
it
is
virtually
all
we
have
to
work
with.
it's
the
landmark
case
as
i
indicated
that
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
oh
there
is
a
great
volume
of
material
below,
yes
sir.
the
cases
are
virtually
numerous,
it's
true.
the
sorrells
case
is
a
landmark
case,
l.
chadmick
was
a
valid
defense.
it
set
up
rather
general
standards
from
which
the
law
of
courts
were
to
work
in
determining
whether
the
defense
has
been
proved
or
not.
i
mentioned
the
controlling
question
is
whether
the
person
is
otherwise
innocent.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
oh
yes.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
go
along
with
the
majority
of
opinion
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
the
philosophy
of
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
the
legislature
didn't
intend
the
law
to
apply.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well
i
am
sorry
if
i
used
the
word
defense
loosely,
your
honor.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
i
subscribe
to
that
completely.
now
in
deciding
this
controlling
question
of
whether
the
person
is
otherwise
innocent,
this
court
said,
the
predisposition
and
criminal
design
of
the
defendant
are
relevant
and
went
to
say
that
defendant
could
not
complain
of
a
searching
inquiry
into
his
own
conduct
and
predisposition
as
bearing
on
the
issue.
now
sir,
within
that
framework,
we
say
here,
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
of
predisposition
or
criminal
design,
and
that
is,
point
one
of
the
case.
the
only
evidence
here
is
evidence
at
the
most,
the
willingness
to
be
seduced
by
the
government
agent
at
the
time
of
the
meeting
with
marshall.
we
submit
if
that
is
all
that
the
court
below
rested
its
decision
upon
and
we
submit
that
it
was
erroneous
in
that
regard.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
would
say
that
case
is
a
clear
case
of
entrapment,
your
honor,
and
there
should
be
no
convictions.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
oh
no,
i
think
there
will
be
controversy
right
here,
but
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
and
he
immediately
accepted.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well
sir
–
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
what
do
you
mean
by
not
sorrells,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
clear
case
of
a
ballot
defense
of
entrapment.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
think
it's
arguable,
yes
indeed.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well
sir,
as
i
interpret
the
majority
below,
i
believe
what
they
have
said
here
is
this
defendant
acquiesced
so
willingly
in
the
suggestion
that
that
is
enough
to
rebut
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
clear
case
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
this
or
a
sub-clause
2,
that
they
would
fall
on
the
same
side
of
the
line,
yes
sir.
and
my
reason
for
it,
it's
really
kind
of
expressed
by
judge
frank
below
than
by
me.
he
discusses
the
majority
of
decisions
on
page
119
of
the
record,
and
then
says
in
his
words
which
to
me
are
very
persuasive.
if
my
colleague's
distinction
between
easy
and
a
difficult
persuasion
is
adopted,
how
will
it
work?
just
what
is
an
easy
seduction,
what
is
its
measure?
after
how
long
a
period
of
official
instigation
is
a
defendant's
literal
infarction
of
a
statute
not
a
crime?
will
it
be
a
crime
if
he
yields
to
be
detected
as
blandishment
at
the
end
of
two
or
three
months
but
not
at
the
end
of
8
or
10?
in
other
words,
i
think
any
case
which
rests
for
its
rebuttal
of
the
defense
on
the
defendant's
willingness,
whether
it's
instantaneous
or
in
your
case,
two
or
three
months,
i
think
any
case
where
that
is
the
only
evidence
to
rebut
the
defense,
the
defense
is
not
rebutted,
because
i
think
it's
unworkable.
i
think
there
must
be
evidence
of
predisposition
of
some
past
conduct
which
will
justify
what
this
court
said
in
the
sorrells
case
is
a
questionable
practice
on
the
part
of
law
and
enforcement
officials,
only
justified
as
a
device
or
a
strategem
to
catch
somebody
who
they
can't
otherwise
catch,
who
is
engaged
in
the
criminal
activity.
now,
there
is
no
evidence
here,
no
evidence
here
of
past
sales
of
narcotics,
no
evidence
of
narcotic
use,
no
evidence,
in
fact,
on
the
contrary,
clear
proof
that
this
defendant
was
unprepared
on
january
14
to
sell
narcotics,
because
assuming
the
greatest
willingness,
it
took
him
six
weeks
to
find
even
a
middleman
who
could
lead
the
agent
to
somebody
with
narcotics.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
is
evidence
of
that,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
of
course
it
was
pure
heresy
as
far
as
the
truth
of
it
was
concerned.
i
think
it's
admissible
because
it
was
part
of
the
circumstances
which
got
marshall
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
defendant.
but
so
far
as
being
evidence
of
past
activity,
i
don't
believe
it
was
evidence
of
that.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
was
it
limited
at
the
trial?
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
not.
now,
there
is
a
second
ground
here
your
honors
which
applies
to
this
case,
i
think
more,
specifically
than
the
general
matter
i
have
been
discussing,
and
that
is,
even
if
ready
acquiescence
is
enough,
it
must
at
least
be
ready
acquiescence
expressed
to
the
first
persuader.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
right
for
the
court
to
say,
oh,
i
have
missed
a
defendant.
when
marshall
came
to
you,
you
said,
fine,
i
will
go
and
locate
you
a
source.
that's
not
enough
because
absent
--
the
defendant's
testimony,
the
record
is
silent
on
the
persuasion
practiced
on
him
by
the
first
government
agent
kowel.
so
that
even
on
this
issue
of
willingness
or
this
rebuttal
to
the
defense
of
entrapment
based
on
defendant's
willingness
there
is,
we
contend,
a
fatal
hole
in
the
government's
case.
the
defendant
testified
as
to
it
at
length,
described
his
reluctance,
as
ultimately
reluctant
to
yielding
kowel's
persuasion
and
of
course
the
jury
disbelieved
it,
but
once
again,
if
it
is
disbelieved,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
what
kowel
said
to
the
man
or
what
his
reaction
was
to
it.
those
are
the
two
grounds,
your
honor,
the
first
that
willingness
alone
is
not
enough,
there
must
be
some
evidence
of
predisposition,
past
conduct
or
preparedness,
and
even
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
ready
acquiescence
might
be
evidence,
if
you
will,
of
predisposition,
in
this
case
there
was
not
prima
facie
proof
of
willingness
because
the
record
of
silent,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
of
the
artifices
practiced.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
the
court
for
its
charge,
your
honor,
really
quoted
from
the
first
sherman
case
in
the
second
circuit.
in
other
words,
it
charged
that
once
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
yes
sir,
we
are
content
with
the
charge,
yes,
we
are.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes,
they
did.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
charge
is
at
page
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
second
one
is
following
me
right
here
today;
the
first
one
was
the
one
learned
hand
wrote
the
opinion.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
first
one
that
the
charge
came,
that's
correct.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
it's
at
page
97
of
the
printed
transcript.
if
i
may
summarize
briefly
on
it,
i
think
it
is
a
proper
standard.
the
court
said
in
substance
that
once
inducement
by
the
government
has
been
shown,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
defendant
was
ready
and
willing
without
persuasion
to
commit
the
offense
shown
and
our
contention
is
here
that
there
is
no
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
the
defendant
was
ready
and
willing
without
persuasion
to
commit
the
offense.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
just
a
minute
on
this
question
of
burden.
it's
quite
true
as
mr.
knapp
said
that
sorrell's
case
doesn't
discuss
it.
the
rule
which
the
second
circuit
has
announced
and
followed
in
this
case
and
which
i
submit
is
the
correct
rule,
is
that
once
the
defendant
proves
inducement
by
the
government,
the
government
then
has
the
burden
of
meeting
the
sorrell
standard,
that
is
the
government
then
has
the
burden
and
at
the
same
degree
of
proof
that
the
government
must
satisfy
in
any
criminal
case,
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
defendant
was
not
a
person
otherwise
innocent.
in
the
opinion
below
here,
majority
opinion,
at
page
115
of
the
transcript,
the
majority
says
we
think
it
plain
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
both
the
sale
and
the
conspiracy
were
induced
by
marshall,
a
government
agent
and
that
being
so,
the
burden
was
on
the
government
by
way
of
reply
to
the
defensive
entrapment
to
prove
a
sufficient
excuse
for
the
entrapment.
now
in
proving
that
sufficient
excuse
i
submit
that
it
is
not
enough
to
show
as
mr.
knapp
has
urged
the
mental
process
of
the
defendant.
i
think
that
is
a
very
slim
and
insubstantial
standard
by
which
to
judge
guilt
or
innocence.
a
man
maybe
easily
persuaded,
he
may
as
mr.
knapp
pointed
out
in
the
record
here
need
money.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
had
understood
mr.
knapp
to
say
mr.
justice
harlan
that
if
the
government
could
show
that
in
the
defendant's
mental
process,
he
was
not
an
innocent
person
then
the
defense
of
entrapment
is
rebutted
and
i
take
issue
with
that.
i
think
his
mental
process
--
i
think
his
mental
process
is
not
the
test,
perhaps
i've
misstated.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
sir
if
that's
the
fact
then
we
certainly,
we
agree
on
that.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well,
then
let
me
go
further,
i
certainly
accept
that
as
my
view
of
the
case
too
and
i
go
further
and
say
that
the
expression
of
willingness
at
the
first
meeting
between
the
government
agent
and
the
potential
defendant,
that
expression
of
willingness
is
not
evidence
itself
of
prior
dealings
in
narcotics
and
whether
we
differ
about
that
i
don't
know.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
he
has
here,
what
i
consider
the
evidence
how
much
the
court
below
the
line
the
evidence
of
the
second
conversation
at
which
the
defendant,
so
both
sides
testified,
expressed
himself
as
willingness
to
take
the
ball
and
to
run
with
it.
now
my
opinion
that's
the
only
substantial
evidence
in
the
case
as
to
the
defendant's
mental
attitude
or
his
past
activities
or
anything
else
and
i
say
that
is
insufficient.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i'd
say
it
does
not.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
that's
correct,
yes
sir,
and
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
sure
your
honor
and
i
think
it
goes
right
back
to
this
question
of
otherwise
innocent.
this
man
or
any
man
might
go
through
his
entire
life
without
the
improper
suggestion
having
ever
been
made
and
if
that's
state
of
the
record
i'd
say
he
was
entrapped.
if
on
the
other
hand
you
can
start
preparedness
or
if
you
can
show
past
conduct
or
any
facts
outside
of
his
mental
condition
then
that
evidence
is
relevant
and
maybe
introduced
to
rebut
the
evidence
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
exactly
sir,
exactly
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
there
is
not
your
honor,
and
if
there
isn't,
i
am
pleased
that
there
isn't
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir
(attempt
to
laughter)
now,
on
the
question
of
kowel
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
first
time
marshall
met
that
time
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
answer
the
thrust
of
your
question
first.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
willingness
goes
to
the
question
or
it
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
the
question,
absent
evidence
of
conduct
or
preparedness.
now,
i
do
have
to
disagree
with
you
about
the
statement
of
fact,
quinine
which
was
the
question,
quinine
is
not
a
narcotic,
anybody
can
buy
it
in
the
drug
store,
there
is
no
crime
involved
in
selling
it.
there
is
no
crime
involved
in
selling
quinine
which
was
the
particular
article
which
kowel
had
said,
the
defendant
had
previously
sold.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
no,
it's
not
a
narcotic
your
honor.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
it
is
used
by
persons
in
the
narcotics
business
to
weaken
the
strength
of
a
narcotic
in
the
same
way
you
might
water
a
whisky.
that's
its
purpose.
so
that
even
if
it
were
true
what
kowel
said
and
the
evidence,
says
the
evidence
of
course,
even
if
it
were,
and
i
think
the
proper
terms
is
substantially
and
competent
evidence
from
which
the
jury
might
have
found
that
my
client
did
sell
the
quinine.
it
was
nearly
going
to
do
it
and
i
don't
think
it
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
he
trafficked
in
narcotics
or
not.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is.
i
think
this
sir,
i
think
again
giving
it
the
weight
which
you
say
evidence
should
be
given,
it
is
not
substantial
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
have
found
that
he
was
engaged
in
narcotic
business.
and
i
think
it
is
that
bit
of
evidence,
if
it
is
evidence
at
all
on
this
issue,
is
the
only
(inaudible)
evidence
it's
in
the
record
of
any
conduct
on
the
defendant's
part
with
the
narcotic
business,
and
even
that
is
the
solicitation
if
you
will
of
offers
and
doesn't
indicate
that
he
was
actually
engaged
in
the
business.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well
your
honor,
frankly
i
am
not
sure
this
was
in
fact
should
be
given
it.
it
wasn't
discussed
by
the
court
below
and
hasn't
been
in
issue
in
the
case
until
now.
it
is
clear
what
he
was
saying,
it
was
induced
by
the
defendant's
attorney
on
cross-examination.
it's
relevant
in
the
sense
of
showing
what
led
marshall
to
the
defendant.
i
myself,
the
question
has
been
raised
at
all
would
have
got
a
proper
instruction
to
the
jury,
would
have
been
that
they
should
not
accept
it
as
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
statement,
but
merely
as
evidence
that
that
remark
was
made
to
marshall
and
then
he
then
approached
the
defendant.
but
i
don't
think
that
for
purposes
of
reviewing
the
record,
it
is
efficient
for
saying
that
was
substantial
and
competent
evidence
in
which
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
defendant
was
in
the
narcotics
business.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
well
your
honor,
to
be
frank
about
it,
the
reason
for
the
strategy
of
the
case
if
you
will
was
that
the
prospects
of
ever
writing
at
this
court
are
so
slim
when
you
are
appealing
from
the
trial
court,
i
was
appealing
to
the
second
circuit,
the
charge
was
almost
a
verbatim
quote
from
the
sherman
case
at
that
circuit
which
i
think
is
a
correct
holding.
and
i
was
sure
at
that
point,
i
turned
out
to
be
wrong,
but
i
was
sure
at
that
point
that
if
court
followed
the
sherman
case,
i
would
have
won
a
reversal.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
i
didn't
raise
it
below,
i
certainly
not
before
you
--
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
no
sir
i
was
not.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
oh
yes
sir,
i
certainly
did.
i
thought
it
was
a
correct
charge.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
no
there
were
no
exceptions
taken.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
would
have
had
to,
that's
true
and
then
perfectly
frankly
i
thought
that
in
substance
it
was
a
correct
charge
and
following
the
language
of
it,
the
judge
should
have
directed
the
entry
of
judgment
of
acquittal.
now,
i
do
wish
to
make
one
comment
again
about
the
question
of
the
man
kowel.
i
am
not
sure
whether
it's
still
conceded
that
he
was
an
employee
of
the
government,
i
assume
it
is.
i
agree
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
about
his
approach
to
the
defendant,
when
he
approached
the
defendant,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
he
brought
the
defendant
and
marshall
together
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
narcotics.
and
i
think
the
very
uncertainty
which
fills
the
record
on
the
subject
of
how
they
met,
what
they
talked
about,
what
the
defendant
said,
kowel
said,
that
very
uncertainty
creates
the
hole
in
the
government's
case
that
i
have
mentioned
before.
how
can
you
say
a
man
is
not
otherwise
innocent
in
regards
to
an
illegal
proposal
when
you
don't
know
what
the
proposer
said
to
him
and
you
don't
know
what
he
said
to
the
proposer
and
really
kowel
approached
him
first.
it's
not
fair
to
judge
the
defendant
by
his
reaction
to
marshall
when
you
don't
know
how
he
reacted
to
kowel.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
no
this
is
the
verbatim
minute.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
yes
sir,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
merrell
e.
clark,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor,
i
am
very
grateful
for
that.
