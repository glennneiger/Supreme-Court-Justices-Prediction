ask

a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
in
here
argument
here
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
raises
the
issue
of
(inaudible)
what
is
it
that
you
don't
subscribe?
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice

m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there
is
no
issue
between
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
mr.
knapp
there
is
no
issue
on
that
between
you
as
far
as
the
standards
are
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
not
proved
in
this
record
that
the
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
this
man
was
engaged
in
narcotic
activities
(inaudible)
agree
with
you
of
this
case
for
this
man.
justice

m.
harlan
that's
(inaudible)
but
that's
what
i
understood
he
say.

got
more
than
that,

got
the
second
conversation.

that
you
are
actually
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
am
puzzled
why
you
so
readily
accept
the
judge's
charge
as
adequate
in
the
process
that
you
arguing
the
case.
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
said
that
the
judge
should
have
charged
the
jury,
that
they
could
not
find
that
this
man
who's
well
indicted,
in
the
absence
of
finding
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
business
or
had
contacts
with
the
business,
there
is
nothing
of
that
kind
in
the
judge's
charge
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
all
events
the
question
of
charge
is
not
before
us,
but
you
didn't
raise
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
don't
misunderstand
me
i
am
not
criticizing
you,
all
i
was
just
trying
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
what
your
point
was,
what
are
those
charges
you
made
