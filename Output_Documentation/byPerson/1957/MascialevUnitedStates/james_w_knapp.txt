mr.
james
w.
knapp
may
it
please
your
honor,
it
seems
that
the
defense's
contention
is
really
this,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
he
what
hasn't
almost
abandoned
or
one
of
them.
i
may
be
incorrect
in
that,
but
there
were
two
government
agents.
he
says
i
was
trapped
by
both
of
them,
at
least
that's
what
i
thought
he
was
arguing
until
i
heard
him
argue
and
he
seems
to
admit
that
as
to
the
approach
by
the
government
agent
marshall
that
the
evidence
shows
willingness
and
readiness
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
to
engage
in
the
narcotics
traffic.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
if
that
is
the
case
and
we
will
show
(inaudible)
to
contend
of
course
that
willingness
is
not
enough,
that
we
have
to
show
more
than
willingness
to
make
out
that
there
was
no
entrapment
in
this
issue.
but
he
admits
that
the
testimony,
as
far
as
marshall
was
concerned,
is
that
the
defendant
was
ready
and
willing
to
engage
in
the
narcotics
traffic
on
january
14,
1954,
when
marshall
first
approached
him
about
it
and
i
would
like
to
read
for
your
honor
the
testimony
of
marshall
in
that
respect.
he
said,
chappy,
jack
and
i
then
sat
down
in
one
of
the
booths
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
from
record,
page
6,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
almost
immediately
we
started
to
discuss
the
narcotics
traffic.
i
told
chappy
that
i
was
interested
in
large
quantities
of
drugs,
heroin
to
be
exact,
and
not
as
a
street
pusher.
and
if
i
may
quote,
but
that
i
have
transacted
my
business,
posed
as
a
seller
out
of
new
york
city,
and
i
was
only
interested
in
good
and
large
quantities.
and
he
should
tell
me
right
away
if
he
is
not
the
person
to
see,
then
we
will
finish
this
conversation
pleasantly
right
then
and
there.
now,
that's
what
his
initial
approach
to
the
defendant
was,
but
the
defendant
didn't
tell
him
he
was
not
willing.
he
questioned
the
man
as
to
his
knowledge
of
the
narcotics
traffic.
the
entire
topic
was
to
find
out
my
extent
of
my
--
of
the
narcotics
traffic
and
then
mr.
masciale
told
me
and
this
is
record
page
7,
your
honor
that
primarily
he
was
a
gambler
and
that
he
was
not
a
narcotics
trafficker
as
such,
that
his
business
was
mostly
gambling,
but
that
he
knew
the
right
people
in
the
narcotics
traffic.
he
further
said
that
up
to
a
week
ago
or
a
week
prior
question
that
would
have
been
a
week
prior
to
january
14th,
prior
to
january
14th
he
knew
or
he
had
a
very
good
source
which
could
supply
me
with
x
amount
of
quality
of
heroine,
but
that
somehow
he
had
a
falling
out
with
these
people.
he
said
further
that
he
knew
someone
whom
he
considered
high
up
in
the
narcotics
traffic
and
to
whom
he
could
introduce
me
in
that
i
was
able
to
get
and
i
can
quote
this,
“88%
pure
heroine”
from
this
source.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
if
he
produced
the
man,
of
course
he
would,
because
he
would,
because
he
was
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
do
not
think
that
what
go
far
enough
to
making
an
aider
and
abettor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
it
is
a
close
question,
your
honor.
it
might
very
well
make
it
a
coconspirator.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
do
not
think
it
is
merely
sitting
down
and
discussing
it,
but
when
you
consider
all
other
facts
here
did
not
merely
discuss
it.
he
went
further.
he
went
further
here.
he
said
that
masciale
told
me
he
is
primarily
a
gambler
that
he
is
not
a
narcotics
trafficker
as
such,
but
that
he
knew
the
right
people,
that
he
had
a
very
good
source
which
could
supply
me
with
an
excellent
quality
of
heroine,
but
somehow
he
had
had
a
falling
out
with
him,
and
that
he
knew
someone
he
considered
high
in
the
narcotics
traffic
to
whom
he
could
introduce
me,
and
that
i
was
able
to
get
88%
pure
heroin.
it
is
much
further
than
just
sitting
down
and
having
an
accidental
conversation
in
which
he
mentions
the
man's
name
where
he
might
able
to
get
it.
now
that
is
a
different
situation.
he
is
going
further
and
he
has
taken
the
ball
after
it
has
been
given
to
him
and
he
is
running
with
it.
he
says
he
can
talk.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now
as
i
understand
at
this
sorrells'
case
resulted
in
just
that
conflict
among
his
bench.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
the
majority
of
the
court,
there
was
one
judge
who
said
it
was
not
entrapment
at
all
and
the
majority
opinion
said
there
is
not
any
offence.
this
isn't
where
you
plea
in
bar
say
i
did
it
with
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
says
this
is
no
offense.
now
the
reason
it
is
not
an
offense
is
that
the
government
will
not
be
presumed
to
intent
--
the
right
of
the
congress
to
intent
the
conviction
of
people
who
are
enticed
and
induced
into
the
commission
of
the
government's
agent.
it
is
the
government's
duty
to
prevent
crime
and
not
to
incite
it,
the
real
freedom
of
man.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
please,
we,
of
course,
agree
with
the
theory
of
the
sorrells
case,
but
as
i
believe
mr.
judge
hand
pointed
out
in
the
(inaudible)
case
afterwards
that
it
did
not
solve
everything.
it
was
a
general
laying
down
the
principles
of
law
which
the
district
courts
and
circuit
courts
had
to
work
in
and
they
had
to
find
the
means
of
carrying
out
this
mandate
of
this
court.
perhaps,
that
is
where
we
have
no
trouble.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
understand
your
honor
and
i
think
i
understand
the
reason,
because
if
the
position
of
the
majority
and
of
the
court
has
a
final
say
is
that
it
is
no
offense,
it
is
a
not
guilty
plea
and
it
is
showing
in
which
you
are
entitled
to
finding
not
guilty.
he
did
not
commit
it.
and
in
that
respect,
the
sorrells
case,
those
it
seems
to
me
the
courts
did
not
bother
whether
he
is
entrapped
or
not
is
not
simply
what
was
done,
what
was
asked,
but
what
was
his
mental
process
at
the
time.
was
he
a
person
who
was
otherwise
innocent
who
would
not
have
ever
committed
this
or
ever
done
this
thing
if
it
had
not
been
brought
out
and
suggested
and
induced
and
incited
by
the
government?
now
when
we
get
to
that
question
of
what
was
his
mental
process
at
the
time
the
only
way
we
can
ever
tell
is
by
the
evidence
and
by
what
the
factual
situation
is.
here
in
this
case
how
do
we
tell
his
mental
process,
by
what
he
said,
his
willingness
to
go
along
with
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
excuse
me
–
mr.
james
w.
knapp
thank
you.
at
the
recess
i
was
speaking
i
believe
of
the
evidence
of
intent
which
is
important,
because
we
maintain
that
this
is
a
jury
question,
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
whether
this
man
had
decreed
this
position,
the
intent
in
his
mind
at
the
time
he
was
approached
by
marshall.
and
in
that
respect
the
evidence
which
i
have
read
from
the
record
i
think
conclusively
proves
that
at
the
time
he
was
first
approached
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
say
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
traffic,
but
he
didn't.
he
was
like
the
merchant
who
when
you
walking
and
ask
him
for
something
says
i
don't
have
it,
but
come
back.
he's
ready
to
sell
it
to
you.
it
maybe
an
article
he'd
never
even
heard
off,
but
he's
convinced
that
he's
able
to
purchase
it
and
resell
it
at
a
profit.
now
that's
what
this
man
was
doing.
he
may
not
have
had,
and
as
he
said,
a
ready
market
because
--
a
ready
source
rather,
because
his
previous
source
he
had
had
some
difficulty
with.
but
he
thought
he
knew
where
he
could
get
and
he
said
to
him
come
back
and
they
exchanged
telephone
numbers.
and
thereafter,
the
witness
marshall
testified
about
further
meeting
at
which
they
drove
around
brooklyn
looking
and
talking
and
discussing
the
possible
sources
of
narcotics
and
how
the
petitioner
had
gotten
out
of
his
car
and
went
around
the
block
or
around
the
corner
and
came
back
and
said
he
thought
he
had
seen
someone.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
please
i
don't
know
whether
that
conversation
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
he
was
in
the
business.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
it
is
very
close
to
it,
because
he
certainly
a
man
who
has
said,
i
have
sources.
i
have
had
some
trouble
with
my
sources
and
i
know
other
sources
where
i
can
get
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes
sir.
mr.
masciale
told
me
primarily
he
was
a
gambler.
he
was
not
narcotics
trafficker
as
such.
that
his
business
was
mostly
gambling,
but
he
knew
the
right
people
in
the
narcotics
traffic
and
he
said
that
up
to
a
week
ago
prior,
prior
to
january
14th
he
knew
had
a
very
good
source
which
could
supply
me
with
excellent
quality
of
heroin,
but
that
somehow
he
had
a
falling
out
with
these
people.
so
he
said
that
he
had
a
source.
i
think
you
might
readily
infer
from
that
he
might
have
been
in
the
business.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
page
7
your
honor
and
he
said
further
that
he
knew
someone
whom
he
considered
high
up
in
the
narcotics
traffic,
to
whom
he
would
introduced
me
and
that
i
would
be
able
to
get,
and
i
can
quote
this,
88%
pure
heroin,
certainly
indicates
that
he
thought
he
knew
where
he
could
go
to
get
it
even
though
his
prior
source
he
had
had
a
falling
out
with.
so
and
his
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
should
think
your
honor
that
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
if
you
mean
by
initiated
whether
he
asked
the
defendant.
he
might
not
have
asked
him
in
so
many
words,
can
you
get
me
narcotics,
but
he
did
say
and
he
should
tell
me
right
away
if
he's
not
the
person
to
see.
now
that
certainly
implies
he
is
really
asking,
there
is
no
--
i
don't
think
there
is
much
dispute
about
that,
sir.
now
the
petitioner
said
he
needed
money.
he
admitted
telling
marshall
that
he
needed
money.
he
needed
money,
because
he
had
to
pay
his
lawyer.
he
admitted
telling
marshall
that
he
had
learned
about
narcotics
traffic
through
his
big
gambling
contacts,
although
he
did
blame
that
on
kowel.
he
admitted
his
gambling
convictions.
he
admitted
a
conviction
for
conspiracy
to
rob
on
--
that
was
his
direct
testimony,
and
seifert,
the
other
actual
procurer
or
the
actual
middleman
testified
that
he
was
to
make
a
$100
from
this
transaction
and
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
petitioner
and
that
he
did
give
him
$50.
so
there
is
some
evidence.
he
admitted
that
he
had
prior
been
a
gambler
which
connects
with
his
first
statement
to
marshall
and
seifert
at
least
produced
evidence
stating
that
he
had
gotten
money
out
of
this
transaction.
so
that
when
you
take
his
admissions
plus
the
evidence
of
seifert,
there
is
certainly
some
corroboration
for
the
idea
that
he
was
telling
mr.
marshall
exactly
the
truth
of
this
original
conversation.
now
there
were
some
subsequent
conversations
after
january
14th
and
leading
up
to
march
1st,
the
day
when
they
finally
made
contact
with
seifert
who
obtained
and
procured
the
narcotics
on
the
2nd
of
march.
now
in
this
respect
of
the
petitioner
did
locate
seifert
and
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes
sir,
that
evidence
was
adduced
by
the
defendant
on
cross-examination
of
marshall
and
that
evidence
certainly
indicates
that
the
petitioner
masciale
had
previously
been
engaged
in
narcotics
or
that
he
was
certainly
interested
in
engaging
in
narcotics
at
the
time
of
meeting
of
january
14th.
now
there
is
further
in
the
records
of
government
chemist
testified
that
quinine
is
used
as
an
adulterant
for
heroin
and
so
that
the
700
–-
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
as
an
adulterant
for
heroin.
so
that
in
that
respect
he
at
least
is
on
the
fringes
of
the
narcotic
business
producing
700
ounces
of
quinine
and
selling
it
and
plus
the
testimony
that
he
had
told
kowel
that
if
he
ever
anyone
who
was
interested
to
bring
him
over
and
kowel
said
let's
go
see
chappie,
naturally.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
so
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
in
the
form
of
marshall's
testimony
as
to
what
he
was
told
by
kowel
that
the
defendant
had
prior
intention
of
engaging
in
the
narcotics
traffic.
now
during
these
six
weeks,
your
honors,
there
were
numerous
contacts
between
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
certainly.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
so.
once
he
raises
the
issue
of
entrapment.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
subscribe
to
judge
frank's
rule
of
view,
because
i
don't
think
judge
frank
allows
a
scope
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
is
entitled
to
have
on
the
evidence.
the
question
is
whether
the
evidence
shows
a
predisposition,
a
willingness
to
engage
in
this
traffic.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes
sir,
as
to
marshall.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
mean
as
to
his
dealings
with
marshall.
we
are
speaking
of
his
dealings
with
marshall,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
what
is
the
evidence
in
the
record
on
page
18
which
mr.
justice
whitaker
read,
page
18
of
the
record
--
yes
sir,
right
begins
almost
at
the
top
of
the
page.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
right.
this
is
what
marshall
said
kowel
told
him.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no
sir.
kowel
was
not
a
witness.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
apparently
not
at
that
time.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
at
that
time
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
government
did
not
know
where
he
was
and
he
was
not
available.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
right
sir.
that
is
correct
and
on
cross-examination
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
frank
read
his
question,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
page
16
of
the
record
cross-examination
by
mr.
lockeruba
who
is
jack
kowel?
jack
kowel
was
a
special
employee
of
mine.
special
employee
of
yours?
yes
sir.
how
long
a
time
have
you
known
jack
or
jeck
kowel?
very
short
time
prior
to
january
14th.
would
you
say
a
short
time
being
two
months?
answer,
i
doubt
if
even
that
long
perhaps
only
and
he's
broken
into
question;
less
than
two
months,
answer;
less
than
two
months.
so
there
is
an
indication
there
that
he'd
only
known
kowel
for
a
short
time.
on
page
17,
he
stated
how
did
you
meet
jack
kowel?
he
came
into
my
office
one
day
and
he
again
the
question;
voluntarily,
answer;
voluntarily
of
his
own
free
will,
answer;
of
his
own
free
will.
so
and
there
is
further
evidence
on
top
of
page
17
that
he
was
only
paid
expenses
so
while
this
man
has
designated
as
a
special
employee
he
is
actually
an
informant
who
is
receiving
some
expense
money
from
the
government
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
understand
that
to
be
the
case,
you
know
and
it
certainly
is
–
it
seems
that
way
from
this
record.
i
understand
that
he
is
man
who
from
this
record
that
came
into
the
office
voluntarily
and
gave
this
information.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
next
question
is
kowel.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
kowel
–-
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no
sir.
kowel
was
not
an
addict.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
that
on
the
page
--
record
page
19,
you'll
find
that
marshall
was
cross-examined
about
that.
question;
did
he
have
a
prior
record,
answer;
none
that
i
could
find;
none
that
you
could
find?
in
other
words,
i
looked
it
up
or
i
checked
it
in
our
files
and
he
had
no
previous
conviction
as
to
any
narcotics
violations.
i
see
so
that
you
limited
yourself
to
any
narcotics
convictions
or
that
your
record
showed
under
the
name
jack
kowel.
that
is
correct.
did
you
take
his
fingerprints?
no,
i
did
not.
now
the
defendant
has
testified
that
he
knew
this
man
kowel
under
a
different
name,
but
at
least
as
far
as
the
government's
check
of
the
man
kowel
under
the
name
of
kowel
it
produced
no
records
of
having
had
any
narcotic
addiction
or
having
ever
been
engaged
in
the
trafficking.
now
as
far
as
the
testimony
is
concerned,
the
record
indicates
that
the
government
did
not
know
at
the
time
of
trial
where
kowel
was
because
he
asked
indeed
--
in
the
cross
examination
the
defense
attorney
asked
do
you
know
what
the
address
of
this
jack
kowel
is,
answer
right
now
sir,
question,
at
that
time?
i
did
know
at
that
time,
yes
sir,
i
cannot
remember.
now
it
was
somewhere
in
the
bronx
of
dunhill
road.
would
have
it
been
116090
(inaudible)
avenue
in
the
bronx?
it
could
be.
i
cannot
be
certain,
i
was
there
once.
do
you
know
where
this
person
is
now?
answer
the
last
i
heard
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
california
somewhere.
then
there
are
questions
about
him
being
married
and
having
--
and
the
witness
answers
he
was
married,
his
wife
had
tuberculosis,
he
had
two
children,
and
i
think
he
had
a
boy
and
a
girl.
he
was
afraid
that
the
boy
was
also
contaminated
with
the
disease
and
the
last
time
i
saw
him
i
think
it
was
in
the
spring
of
1954
when
he
told
me
that
his
wife
was
due
out
of
the
sanitarium
very
shortly
that
new
york
was
not
the
place
for
him
and
he
got
a
job
as
a
truck
driver
or
something
like
that
on
the
west
coast
where
he
and
his
wife
and
kids
would
be
much
better
off
because
of
tuberculosis.
and
the
defendant
cross
examining
asked
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
not
he
leave
his
wife
and
children
and
go
to
the
west
coast
by
himself.
the
answer
was,
it
is
possible,
i
do
not
know.
so
that,
i
think
the
record
is
clear
here
that
the
government
did
not
know
where
kowel
was.
it
was
unable
to
produce
kowel
and
that
is
the
reason
why
evidence
was
adduced
to
contradict
the
defendant
in
his
own
testimony
of
his
relations
with
kowel.
now
the
government
seriously
contends
with
respect
to
the
other
contention
of
the
defendant
or
this
petitioner
which
seems
to
be
that
he
must
escape
solely
on
the
basis
of
his
own
testimony
of
his
relations
with
the
informant
kowel.
you
see
as
i
understand
it
is
because
he
has
had
two
horns
here.
one
he
says
i
was
entrapped
by
marshall
and
secondly
he
says,
well,
before
i
was
even
entrapped
by
marshall
i
was
entrapped
by
informant
kowel.
now
the
record
isn't
too
clear
as
to
exactly
kowel's
position
with
respect
to
his
employment,
if
you
call
it
employment,
by
the
government.
that
certainly
leaves
some
doubt
as
to
exactly
when
marshall
first
met
kowel
and
whether
at
any
time
prior
to
january
14,
there
were
any
discussions
with
respect
to
the
defendant
masciale
and
he
did
testify
however
as
to
the
duties
of
kowel.
a
question
was
asked
on
the
page
16
of
the
record,
were
the
duties
of
jack
kowel
to
locate
people
who
know
something
about
narcotics?
answer
not
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
there
were
other
circumstances
involved
as
far
as
kowel
was
concerned.
so
we
are
in
an
area
there
which
there
is
uncertainty
as
to
just
when
kowel
came
into
the
picture
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
but
in
any
event
he
cannot
escape
on
his
own
testimony.
in
the
first
place,
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
entrapment
and
his
testimony
is
a
testimony
of
a
defendant
who
has
been
shown
to
have
been
willing
almost
to
the
point
of
being
anxious
to
please
marshall
on
the
first
contact.
he
is
a
man
who
said
that
he
knew
of
narcotics
sources
through
his
gambling
context.
he
had
been
convicted
twice
of
gambling
and
his
whole
defense
was
that,
well
i
was
entrapped
by
this
man
who
is
not
here,
the
man
the
government
couldn't
bring.
now
we
think
that
the
jury
could
have
reasons
to
disbelieve
the
petitioner's
own
testimony.
in
the
first
place,
he
is
a
party
partly
interested
in
the
lawsuit
and
his
own
actions,
as
i
pointed
out,
his
actions
and
ready
acceptance
of
the
possibility
of
selling
narcotics
of
his
continued
meetings
with
marshall,
and
of
the
fact
that
he
himself
testified
on
one
occasion,
he
even
took
$200
from
marshall
and
went
out
somewhere
along
and
the
statement
of
marshall
he
is
going
to
buy
narcotics
for
me.
and
he
came
back
and
he
gave
the
money
back,
but
he
explained
that,
he
said,
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
to
appear
that
i
was
still
interested
in
this,
and
he
blames
it
all
on
kowel.
he
says
that
kowel
wanted
me
to
string
him
along.
he
wanted
me
to
keep
him
going
here,
because
it
would
hurt
kowel
if
i
pulled
out.
and
so
his
--
all
of
his
actions,
everything
he
does
he
blames
on
the
other
fellow,
but
still
the
actions,
are
the
actions
of
a
person
who
is
interested
in
getting
narcotics.
now
when
you
get
right
down
to
it,
he
needed
money.
he
admitted
it.
the
record
shows
he
was
paying
for
this.
he
brought
out
on
redirect
record
93
that
at
the
time
he
was
unemployed.
now
the
petitioner
even
went
so
far
on
cross-examination,
record
86
and
92
to
admit
that
kowel
was
completely
out
of
the
picture
when
he
first
approached
seifert.
now
if
he
was
stringing
marshall
along
for
kowel's
benefit
and
so
forth,
why
would
he
then
after
kowel
was
completely
out
of
the
picture,
no
longer
had
anything
to
do
with
this
transaction
as
he
so
testified?
why
then
did
he
get
seifert
and
continue
the
--
and
sell
the
narcotics,
arrange
with
the
sale
of
the
narcotics,
and
he
was
active
in
that.
on
the
morning
of
march
2,
he
was
present
at
the
time
the
agents
met
seifert
and
there
were
some
discussion.
seifert
wanted
$400,
the
agents
didn't
know
whether
to
give
it
to
it
and
finally
seifert
said,
i'll
take
$200
and
go
get
it.
well,
he
didn't
know
whether
to
trust
him
with
the
$200,
after
all
he
is
the
fellow
they
just
met
the
night
before.
and
the
petitioner
says,
i'll
vouch
for
you,
i'll
lend
him
my
sister's
car.
and
he
gave
him
the
sister's
car
and
the
agent
and
seifert
used
the
car
to
go
locate
the
narcotics
and
finally
picked
it
up.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
record
shows
marshall
was
saying
10,
either
by
telephone
or
in
person.
they
were
not
in
person,
but
i
mean
there
were
10
contacts
and
i
think
the
record
on
the
petitioner's
own
testimony
makes
up
approximately
10
contacts.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
certainly
the
meeting
of
march
1st
was
at
masciale's
initiation.
he
called
him
up
and
said
that
he
had
someone.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
in
the
next
meeting,
as
i
understand
it
both
the
government
and
the
defendant
agree
that
as
far
as
the
next
meeting
was
concerned
that
it
was
initiated
by
marshall,
and
there
are
undoubtedly
several
meetings
that
were
initiated
by
marshall,
and
several
by
the
defendant
either
through
the
--
actually
the
petitioner
is
the
only
one
that
testifies
as
to
the
contact
where
he
took
the
money
to
go
get
narcotics
and
came
back
to
set
a
trail.
and
he
testified
that
was
by
accident
that
he
met
him
at
1st
street
and
1st
avenue
and
it
wasn't
by
full
arrangement.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes
sir,
marshall's
testimony
is
that
he
did
ring
up
the
defendant.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
he
went
after.
he
went
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
right.
he
went
--
he
asked
even
gambler
second
time
and
they
eventually
–
i
believe
the
court
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
but
in
every
--
well
i
think,
your
honor
i
can't
find
it
exactly
in
the
record,
but
i
think
the
petitioner's
own
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
the
marshall
did
say,
are
you
going
to
get
the
ball
rolling
for
me?
and
that
he
said,
well,
i
am
trying.
now,
his
answer
in
every
case
was
i
am
trying
or
i
haven't
got
a
source.
he
never
said,
no,
i
am
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
first
contact,
the
first
contact
was
by
the
government
through
the
informant
kowel,
the
second
contact
was
by
marshall
by
telephone
and
then
he
went
over
and
saw
him.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
there
were
other
contacts
some
of
which
were
initiated
by
masciale
and
the
final
contact
which
resulted
in
the
meeting
with
seifert
which
resulted
in
the
buy
was
made
by
masciale.
so
that
you
have
in
that
instance
some
where
the
government
started,
some
where
masciale
started,
so
that
--
now
to
get
back
to
kowel's
testimony,
i
mean
to
the
petitioner's
testimony
with
respect
to
kowel,
we
say
that,
that
is
proper
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
on
the
proper
instruction
and
no
question
has
been
raised
with
respect
to
the
instructions
given
by
the
court
in
this
case.
and
we
say
that
the
jury
might
well
disbelieve
this
man.
they
are
not
bound
to
believe
him.
his
testimony
doesn't
have
to
be
accepted
as
gospel,
particularly
under
these
circumstances
in
that
there
is
testimony
from
which
the
jury
might
disbelieve
his
story
of
blaming
everything
on
kowel
and
if
you
get
to
that
point
and
you
say
we
don't
believe
him
and
we
don't
think
kowel
initiated,
we
think
that
he
did.
we
don't
believe
that
testimony
at
all
about
kowel.
you
have
another
testimony
of
entrapment
by
kowel
and
the
jury
that
justified
in
convicting
him.
he
has
a
burden
of
establishing
to
the
jury
that
he
was
in
fact
entrapped
by
kowel.
and
that
decision
is
strictly
a
jury
question
of
whether
they
believe
this
man,
especially
in
view
of
the
contradictions
in
his
story.
the
reasons
why
they
--
plenty
of
reasons
why
the
jury
didn't
believe
him
and
that
is
all
we
say
that,
that's
a
jury
question,
and
the
government
doesn't
take
the
position
your
honor
that
every
entrapment
case
is
a
jury
question
at
all.
but,
we
say
that
in
this
case,
it
certainly
was
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide
whether
he
was
in
fact
entrapped
by
kowel
and
if
they
found
that
he
was
not,
they
didn't
believe
his
story,
then
there
was
a
further
question
from
which
they
could
find
that
he
was
as
far
as
marshall
was
concerned
ready
and
willing
to
engage
in
the
narcotic
trade.
now,
my
second
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes
sir,
i
believe
he
did.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
think
it
is
on
record,
page
103.
now,
i
will
go
back
to
the
middle
of
the
page.
now,
i
will
go
back
to
that
subject
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset.
this
question
of
entrapment,
and
i
do
that
because
as
i
must
remind
you
that
defense
does
not
dispute
the
transactions
related
by
the
government
witness
as
the
sale
delivery.
defendant's
case
turns
upon
this
question
of
whether
he
was
induced
being
first
otherwise
not
inclined
to
disobey
this
branch
of
the
law
that
he
was
induced
to
do
it
first
through
interviews
with
this
person
who
has
known
to
us
by
two
names,
jack
kowel
and
jack
kowalski.
then
he
goes
on
about
marshall.
since
kowel
was
not
a
--
over
to
page
104,
he
told
you
at
great
length
of
a
series
of
interviews,
this
is
at
the
top
of
the
page
in
the
middle
of
this
first
full
paragraph
on
page
104,
he
told
he
had
great
length
of
a
series
of
interviews,
personal
and
over
the
phone,
between
him
and
this
man,
kowel
that
preceded
the
interview
of
january
14.
and
thus
we
have
the
defendant's
version
that
this
purchase
was
suggested
to
him
by
the
government.
now
the
next
paragraph,
since
kowel
is
not
a
witness
and
marshall
has
told
you
that
kowel
was
there,
you
may
wish
to
accept
the
defendant's
version
of
kowel's
initial
suggestion
to
him.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
since
kowel
is
not
a
witness
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
in
other
words,
the
government
certainly
has
admitted
that
kowel
was
in
the
picture,
through
marshall's
testimony
places,
kowel
was
in
the
picture
and
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
it
does
say
that
you
may
wish
to
accept
the
defendant's
version.
so
it
was
--
it
did
go
to
the
jury
on
that
question
of
entrapment.
and
that's,
what
we
say
now
the
issue
of
willingness
i
think
has
been
covered
in
my
general
discussion
here
that
was
our
second
point
and
we
say
that
readiness
and
willingness
isn't
enough
because
it
goes
to
the
mental
process
of
the
man
at
the
time
of
the
initial
discussion
and
that
as
the
sorrell's
case
points
out,
he
is
not
entrapped
unless
he
is
an
innocent
person.
that
is
one
of
the
natures
of
entrapment.
he
not
only
must
be
approached
and
induced
and
incited
and
i
say
that
i
think
there
was
very
little
incitement
or
inducement
here
by
marshall.
but
still
he
has
the
burden
of
showing
or
rather
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
is
the
person
who
was
not
an
innocent
man.
when,
that
in
considering
that
question
of
what
his
mental
process
was
at
the
time
he
entered
into
this,
it's
a
jury
question,
it's
a
question
in
fact
based
upon
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
case.
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
dealings
that
the
jury
has
to
and
it's
a
jury
question
for
him
to
go
into
and
what
was
this
man
thinking
of
when
he
was
first
approached?
mr.
james

the
cases
so
say
that,
the
circuit
court
cases
so
say,
but
the
sorrell's
case
doesn't
exactly
say
it's
a
government's
burden.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
think
it's
merely
a
burden
based
on
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
i
think
it's
really
a
jury
question.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
if
there
are
other
means
other
than
showing
evidence
from
which
a
jury
might
find
relating
to
his
mental
process.
so
i
think
you
can
take
that
from
all
of
the
facts
in
the
case
and
as
a
matter
of
the
fact
the
way
i
read
the
sorrell's
case
that
when
he
puts
an
entrapment,
he
opens
the
door
to
all
natures
of
proof
by
the
government
relating
to
his
mental
processes.
i
see
my
time
is
up
now.
