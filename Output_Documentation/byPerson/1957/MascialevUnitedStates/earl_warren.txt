mr.
knapp,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
give
me
a
little
more
to
it
than
that
though
in
this,
(inaudible)
actually
testified
that
in
the
first
conversation,
he
said
we
fell
bad
in
the
talking
about
narcotics
immediately.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
defendant
told
me
that
he
didn't
have
any
contacts
right
now
but
he
had
had
some
contacts
in
his
work,
it
wasn't
in
narcotics
primarily,
he
was
a
gambler,
but
he
used
to
know
where
has
he
been
get
the
first
class
heroin
and
he
thought
he
might
set
up
some
connections
again.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that
was
at
the
very
first
time
they
met,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
right
into
talking
along
those
lines
and
he
sort
of
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
don't
you
think
that
when
you
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
man
kowel
had
told
marshall
that
he
had
once
been
an
intermediary
between
the
defendant,
and
another
man
for
$800
worth
of
narcotics,
and
that
he
was
in
that
business,
the
fact
is
–
it
goes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
induced
into
doing
this
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

it
wasn't
a
narcotic?
