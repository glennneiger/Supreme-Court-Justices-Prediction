mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
before
i
start,
may
i
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
black's
last
question
to
mr.
freedman
and
point
out
that
while
on
page
418
of
the
record,
the
third
paragraph
on
that
page
is
the
one
that
has
voted
in
mr.
freedman's'
brief
that
the
two
preceding
paragraphs
deal
with
the
--
at
the
pertinent
subject
and
the
paragraph
that
supported
this
but
one.
in
other
words,
the
court
is
not
being
able
to
deal
with
three
subjects
in
the
same
paragraph
and
the
same
words
shows
it
dealt
with,
than
to
deal
with
him
in
three
succeeding
paragraphs.
and
i
think,
sir,
that
when
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
context,
you
will
see
that's
what
the
district
judge
did.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
he
explains
or
rather
he
does
not
hold
that
you
may
not
have
unseaworthiness
without
negligence.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
the
fact,
sir,
that
the
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
understand
that.
i
would
like
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
would
like
to
start,
sir,
then
--
and
then
say
this,
the
facts
which
have
been
argued
here
at
oral
argument
lead
to
me
to
think
that
the
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
to
review
the
facts
and
make
its
own
findings
independent
of
those
of
the
trial
court.
it
had
been
my
understanding
that
the
fact
that
in
admiralty,
there
was
a
trial
de
--
de
novo
had
been
laid
to
rest
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
mcallister
versus
the
united
states.
i
do
not
therefore
intend
to
argue
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
intend
to
rest
my
position
upon
the
findings
and
the
opinion
of
the
courts
below,
and
as
i
see
the
crux
of
this
case,
it
--
it
becomes
one,
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
two,
question
of
the
interpretation
of
a
regulation.
i'll
deal
with
the
regulation
first.
the
regulation
in
question
is
one
promulgated
by
the
coast
guard
and
when
the
owners
look
at
the
original,
we
will
see
that's
headed
to
regulations
for
the
prevention
of
collisions
that's
clear
from
a
title.
it
requires
that
lights
on
certain
barges
shall
be
at
certain
height
above
the
water
and
ours
were
not
on
that
night.
the
position
that
the
court
below
took
and
i
think
it
is
well
founded,
well
based
in
a
party
is
that
where
you
have
a
regulation
for
the
prevention
of
collision,
that
you
maybe
negligent
to
cause
a
violation
where
there
is
collision,
but
that
is
not
evidence
of
negligence,
nor
is
it
evidence
of
unseaworthiness.
now,
to
get
into
the
question
of
unseaworthiness
which
as
i
see
it
is
the
crux
of
the
present
case.
i
think
we
have
to
define
our
terms.
the
most
recent
definition
that
i
know
off
is
that
by
this
court
and
mr.
justice
douglas,
you
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
boudoin
versus
lykes
brothers
case.
and
you
there
said
that,
"unseaworthiness
was
not
something
that
was
absolutely
terms.
it
was
all
relevant.
now,
it's
--
if
it
is
relevant
at
all,
then
i
think
you
have
to
apply
the
rules
of
the
facts
which
were
before
the
district
court
in
this
case.
we
have
a
situation
where
--
and
the
findings
of
the
fact
are
not
that
there
were
a
--
mist
or
vapor
all
permeating
this
area.
the
findings
of
fact
on
page
416
of
the
record
is
that
the
cause
of
the
fire
was
the
admission
of
a
highly
inflammable
vapor
lying
above
an
extensive
accumulation
of
some
petroleum
products
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
river.
and
i
think
that
what
district
judge
kirkpatrick
was
talking
about
in
his
opinion
was
whether
you
had
to
hold
under
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness
that
where
a
fire
occur
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
surface
of
a
navigable
river
suddenly
and
quite
and
most
unexpectedly
burst
into
flame,
that
that
was
something
that
a
shipowner
or
tug
owner
had
to
anticipate
and
his
failure
to
anticipate
it
was
either
negligence
or
it
rendered
in
a
ship
unseaworthy.
now,
if
the
rule
on
unseaworthiness
is
absolute
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
a
ship
is
going
past
cape
canaveral
of
the
coast
to
florida
and
one
of
our
test
rockets
should
come
out
of
the
air
because
it
misfires
and
hits
that
ship,
then
at
the
moment
of
impact,
the
place
of
work
that
the
seaman
on
that
ship
where
they're
working
is
unsafe.
and
then,
if
my
opponent's
position
of
what
the
law
should
be
is
correct,
then
i
presuppose
that
everything
else
aside,
that
ship
would,
at
the
moment
that
the
rocket
struck
it,
be
unseaworthy
and
therefore,
there
would
be
absolute
liability
of
the
shipowner
to
members
of
the
crew
working
upon
it.
and
i
suggest
that
that's
analogous
to
the
situation.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
your
honor,
they
were
the
first
people
they
sued.
if
you
will
turn
to
the
brief
and
opposition
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
you
will
find
a
complaint
against
gulf
oil
corporation
set
out
for
bottom
as
an
appendix.
that
suit
was
filed
approximately
one
month
before
american
dredging
company
was
sued.
that
suit
has
been
stayed
to
the
trial,
i
presume,
by
some
arrangement
between
counsel
for
gulf
oil
company
and
--
and
counsel
for
these
petitioners
while
the
petitioners
here
and
the
plaintiffs,
in
the
--
being
the
same
persons
in
the
gulf
oil
company
suit
are
represented
by
the
same
counsel.
i
do
not
represent
gulf
oil
corporation.
it's
only
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
agreed,
sir
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
harrington
has
a
very
minor
claim.
he's
represented
by
another
counsel
and
i
agree
that
harrington's
case
would
abide
the
result
of
this
one.
it
was
frankly,
mr.
justice
warren,
a
question
of
courtesy
and
economics.
this
case
would
not
warrant
all
of
the
expense
involved
in
coming
to
this
court.
if
this
court
should
by
chance
which
i
hope
it
shall
not,
reverse
the
judgment,
mr.
harrington
will
come
in
by
my
agreement.
i
want
to
turn
to
the
fact
that
this
court
is
being
asked
to
deal
with
the
limitation
liability
statute
of
the
united
states.
i
have
gone
in
somewhat
to
the
history
of
that
statute
in
the
brief.
i
have
pointed
out
that
congress
has
amended
it
from
time
to
time
that
when
congress
amended
it
last
in
1935
and
1936,
it
had
before
it,
such
cases
as
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
in
the
lusitania.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
princess
sophia,
it's
actually
reported
as
(inaudible)
versus
canadian
pacific
but
that
doesn't
matter.
and
it
did
not
change
the
law
on
the
point
which
is
here
involved
that
is,
that
where
there
is
a
violation
of
a
statutory
regulation
where
the
regulation
has
been
designed
to
be
the
particular
evil
or
prevent
a
particular
risk
and
there
is
a
loss.
it
did
not
seek
and
the
laws
is
not
within
the
purview
of
the
--
that
presumably
the
regulation
or
statute
was
intended
to
prevent
but
that
does
not
impose
liability,
did
not
render
the
princess
sophia
unseaworthy.
it
so
happened
in
that
case,
there
were
not
a
sufficient
number
of
life
boats
or
the
passengers
that
were
all
board.
in
other
words,
there
were
not
a
--
that
was
a
violation
of
regulation.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
that
was
a
material.
it
did
not
render
the
ship
unseaworthiness,
no
one
escaped
that
disaster
and
therefore
it
had
no
--
it
was
not
the
purpose,
which
the
legislation
would
design
to
accomplish,
had
not
--
had
any
material
bearing.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
causation,
i
think,
that
the
thing
to
determine
that
i
want
to
--
i'm
groping
for
between
the
statutory
violation
and
the
result
which
followed.
i
think
that
that's
all
that
the
courts
below
in
this
case
had
done.
and
i
have
referred
here
--
this
court
to
mr.
justice
holmes
holding
in
the
eugene
myers
rather
an
old
case.
i
pointed
out
that
the
english
war
on
this
same
question
was
the
same
as
ours
and
so
far
as
i
know,
the
only
law
where
causation
alone
is
a
factor
is
that
of
the
communist
countries.
the
general
western
european
law
all
has
its
--
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
find,
all
has
that
same
concept
that
you
do
not
violate
a
duty
where
the
duty
is
imposed
to
accomplish
a
particular
purpose
and
something
else
happens.
i
suppose
that
--
all
i
know,
there
are
regulations
that
prevent
the
ships
carrying
dynamite
and
such
other
things
and
if
the
--
mr.
justice
warren
the
--
it's
time
up?
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
there
are
regulations
that
prevent
the
carrying
of
dynamite.
if
a
ship
carried
dynamite
and
a
--
a
seaman
tripped
over
a
case
of
it,
not
because
it
wasn't
labeled
dynamite
but
because
it
was
put
in
some
place.
i
question
very
much
that
there
is
any
nation,
any
maritime
nation
certainly
not
france,
england
or
the
united
states
up
to
this
point
which
would
say
that
the
ship
was
therefore
unseaworthy.
it
would
have
definitely
been
unseaworthy
because
of
improper
labeling
of
this
case,
if
there'd
an
explosion
of
the
dynamite
and
that's
almost
the
situation
we
have
here.
now
again,
getting
to
the
field
of
international
law
and
i'm
trying
to
go
as
fast
as
i
can.
i
want
to
call
the
attention
of
this
court,
the
fact
that
the
limitation
of
liability
statute
of
the
united
states
while
it's
over
100
years
old
and
hasn't
been
amended
in
27
years,
there,
the
united
states
was
one
of
32
member-nations
which
in
october
of
this
year,
met
at
brussels,
the
draft
of
a
convention,
an
international
convention
relating
to
the
limitation
of
liability
of
owners
of
seagoing
vessels
was
released
by
the
state
department
on
october
15th,
1957
as
its
document
number
577.
this
information
has
come
to
my
possession
since
my
brief
was
filed.
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
of
the
32
member-nations
attending,
more
than
half
of
them
have
already
signed
the
convention
and
that
the
announcement
of
the
state
department
was
the
effect
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
press
release
of
october
15th."
the
decision
as
to
whether
the
convention
will
be
signed
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
will
not
be
made
until
there
has
been
consultation
between
the
department
of
state,
commerce,
justice
of
navy
and
with
the
admiralty
bar
and
shipping
industry."
the
fact
to
that
matter
has
come
to
my
attention
because
the
draft
of
it
has
already
been
submitted
to
a
subcommittee
of
what
is
known
as
the
american
merchant
marine
institute
and
i
am
informed
unofficially
that
it
has
recommended
that
the
united
states
sign
these
brussels
convention.
i
don't
know
whether
it
will
or
not
of
course.
the
united
states
did
not
and
i
believe
frankly
the
court
did
not
sign
on
1922
brussels
convention
because
in
objective
to
certain
of
the
provisions,
the
present
convention
or
the
draft
of
it
or
its
actually
the
convention
now
has,
i
believe,
met
many
of
the
objections
which
the
united
states
had
to
the
1922
brussels
convention.
now,
i
point
this
out
to
the
court
as
solely
to
point
up
this
fact
that
should
we
become
a
signatory
to
this
brussels
convention
and
should
our
law
be
that
a
violation
of
a
regulation
almost
in
vacuo
in
other
words,
a
regulation
intended
to
prevent
one
arm
and
another
arm
occurs,
rendering
a
ship
unseaworthy.
that
is
going
to
have
a
great
effect
upon
this
nation's
merchant
marine,
because
we
will
then
be
subjecting
our
industry
to
a
bargain
of
defending
itself
or
being
unable
to
avail
itself
of
limitation
liability
in
cases
where
ships
of
other
nations
can
do
so.
and
it
isn't
a
problem
which
is
as
narrow
as
the
facts
of
whether
the
widows
in
this
case
shall
recover
from
this
defendant
or
not.
we
realized
that
it's
outside
the
scope
of
my
argument
here,
but
this
people
did
have
an
opportunity
to
obtain
workmen's
compensation,
they
rejected
it.
they
have
also
apparently
heard
good
opportunity
to
recover
from
a
tortfeasor.
and
this
court
i
think
would
have
to
set
aside
justice
holmes
holding
in
the
eugene
myers
where
the
situation
involved
this
same
regulation
involving
lights
upon
vessels.
it
was
a
violation
there
and
i
don't
want
to
quote
from
memory,
but
roughly
he
said
that
where
there's
a
violation
of
a
regulation,
that
should
not
and
is
enough
under
american
law
and
he
also
quoted
english
law
to
impose
liability
upon
a
violator
for
the
tort
of
the
third
person.
and
i
think
that's
precisely
the
situation
which
we
have
here
and
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
further
extension
of
the
law
of
the
united
states
to
the
effect
that
unseaworthiness
and
the
absolute
liability
which
follows
it,
come
--
comes
--
shall
be
the
result
except
in
those
cases
where
the
intrumentality
is
intended
to
guard
against
the
harm.
these
lights
were
intended
to
guard
against
the
harm
of
collision.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh,
the
safety
appliance
act
cases,
sir,
first
of
all,
i
think
that
when
this
court
said
that
the
safety
appliance
act
shall
--
acts
shall
apply
let's
say
the
more
than
the
man
who
was
actually
getting
in
between
the
cars,
they
were
saying,
the
--
the
class
of
persons
who
was
intended
to
be
protected
by
the
safety
appliance
act
is
the
railroad
workers.
now,
in
--
in
this
case
extending
the
protection
of
the
clash,
this
clash
already
has
it
and
we
don't
--
we're
not
quarreling
with
that.
we're
saying
that
you're
changing
the
scope
of
the
regulation
here.
in
other
words,
you
--
the
deal
with
the
wolfe
case
and
the
--
some
of
the
other
cases
cited
by
our
opponent
under
the
safety
appliance
act
were
held
against
the
railroad
companies
who
try
to
defend
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
heresy
--
defect
and
errors
of
man
intended
to
be
protected.
he
was
hurt
because
of
the
defect.
but
this
court
said,
"the
fact
that
there
is
a
recital
in
the
congressional
history
of
that
act
that
it's
to
protect
--
they're
only
man
on
coupling
is
not
the
test.
it's
to
protect
a
man
of
this
class,
railroad
workers
from
injury.
though,
i
--
i
say
in
this
case,
this
is
not
a
statute
intended
primarily
to
protect
anybody
from
injuries
--
intended
to
prevent
collisions
between
vessels.
secondly,
i
say
this,
sir,
that
this
--
the
safety
appliance
act
is
specifically
intended
to
prevent
injuries
to
workmen.
now,
this
is
a
--
it
is
present
regulation.
it
is
not
of
that
same
class.
it
is
a
statute
which
is
intended
to
prevent
collisions
of
vessels
on
water.
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
regulation
--
had
this
collision
rather,
occurred
in
daylight,
there
would've
been
no
violation
even
though
we
had
the
lights
on
the
same
place
because
we
could
smoke
and
cook
and
have
a
bonfire
on
the
deck
of
this
thing.
there's
no
--
absolutely
no
regulation
to
prevent
that
as
the
court
below
points
out.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
--
if
these
parties
are
entitled
to
bringing
this
action
by
reason
of
their
provisions
of
the
jones
act,
so
far
as
survival
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
the
jones
act,
their
rights
are
given
them
by
the
jones
act.
in
other
words,
the
jones
act
perpetuates
the
right
which
the
general
admiralty
law
does
not
give
to
maintain
a
--
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
these
people
being
our
employees
upon
navigable
words,
that
right
flows
to
them
from
the
jones
act,
yes,
sir.
it
is
however,
a
--
an
action
under
the
limitation
of
liability
statute.
it
was
so
instituted
and
so
tried
throughout.
i
do
want
to
point
out
sir,
though,
that
the
fact
findings
and
also
the
finding
of
causation
which
to
me
is
very
important
in
this
case
is
generally
considered,
i
thought
to
be
an
issue
for
the
fact
finder
and
not
one
of
law
or
a
review
by
an
appellate
court.
and
the
district
judge
as
i
read
his
opinion
has
held
in
our
favor
on
that
point.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
of
course.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir
the
jones
act
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
i've
not
--
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
the
right
to
maintain
this
action,
sir,
there's
--
another
words,
the
survival
under
the
administrator
of
a
dead
man
is
given
by
the
jones
act.
in
other
words,
the
right
--
the
right
of
action
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
negligence.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
that's
right.
