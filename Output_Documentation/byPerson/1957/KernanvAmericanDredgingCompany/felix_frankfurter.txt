justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
and
fela
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
it
please
ask
a
question
if
there's
a
fela
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
argument
seemed
to
give
some
unseaworthiness?
a
part
of
general
maritime
law,
not
fela
but
all
the
advantages
of
a
fela.
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
cannot
be
what
the
maritime
law
already
provided
for.
if
fela
is
an
exceptional
case
and
then
you
enlarge
the
scope
of
what
maritime
law
was
constitutionally
speaking,
which
is
what
you've
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
didn't
know
what
the
fela,
how
enlarged
that
was
until
the
other
day,
namely
rogers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
it
is,
you'd
get
the
advantage
of
it,
the
maritime
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
i
wish
you
wouldn't
call
a
general
maritime
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
yes.
that's
it.
