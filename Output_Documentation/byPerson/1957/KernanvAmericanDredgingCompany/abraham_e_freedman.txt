mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
sir.
court
please,
these
are
two
cases
claiming
death
--
claiming
damages
for
death
of
--
on
account
of
the
rising
out
of
a
marine
disaster
on
the
schuylkill
river
on
november
of
1952,
sir.
briefly,
two
questions
are
raised
in
this
court.
one,
is
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
qualified
by
considerations
of
negligence.
and
two,
where
in
the
violation
of
a
--
of
a
regulation
--
of
a
governmental
regulation
--
is
it
necessary
to
show
that
the
injury
involved
was
within
the
contemplated
purpose
of
the
regulation
despite
the
fact
that
the
--
the
violation
itself
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
injury.
briefly
sirs,
these
are
the
facts.
the
respondent
here,
the
american
dredging
company,
was
engaged
to
dredge
a
pier
or
at
a
pier
of
the
atlantic
refining
company
in
the
schuylkill
river
in
philadelphia.
the
schuylkill
river
within
the
territory
limits
--
within
the
boundaries
of
philadelphia,
has
lined
along
its
--
its
banks,
a
number
--
probably,
a
half
a
dozen
refineries,
at
several
of
which
there
are
piers
where
ocean
going
tankers
call
and
load,
and
discharge
petroleum
products.
now,
on
this
particular
day,
sirs,
the
american
dredging
company
was
dredging
at
a
point
called
point
breeze
and
--
the
--
several
miles
up
beyond
the
point
where
this
accident
happened
and
the
--
in
connection
with
that
dredging
operation,
the
respondent
here
was
using
a
tugboat
called
the
arthur
n.
herron,
which
was
towing
barges,
flat
barges,
down
the
river
loaded
to
a
dumping
ground
and
then
he
would
bring
them
back
light
to
the
point
breeze,
where
the
dredging
operation
was
being
done.
and
then
pick
up
another
one.
on
this
particular
occasion,
the
arthur
n.
herron,
i
should
say
too,
your
honors,
and
this
is
of
extraordinary
importance
in
this
case
that
along
--
this
accident
happened
opposite
--
in
the
delaware
river,
opposite
the
gulf
refining
piers
or
gulf
refining
plant,
i
should
say.
it's
--
there
are
not
only
piers,
but
there's
a
refining
company
there
as
well.
it's
a
huge
plant
extending
crops
over
several
blocks.
and
on
the
shore
side,
there
were
signs
saying,
"no
smoking.
no
naked
lights."
and
on
the
water
side,
on
the
docks
facing
the
river,
there
were
also
space
every
50
feet
apart,
there
were
signs,
"no
naked
lights.
no
smoking."
now,
in
addition
to
that,
on
this
particular
day
and
of
this
night,
there
were
seven
tankers
that
were
loading
or
discharging
petroleum
products
at
the
gulf
oil
spillways.
it
is
--
testimony
shows
quite
clearly
that
in
connection
with
the
loading
or
discharging
operations,
petroleum
fumes
are
given
off
and
in
the
various
governmental
periodicals,
a
good
bit
of
which
is
within
the
coast
guard
regulations.
it
is
a
known
fact
that
these
gases
tend
to
permeate
the
atmosphere
and
sometimes
they
can
be
flashed
some
distance
away
and
the
flash
will
set
the
whole
area
or
fire
back
to
the
point
of
origin,
even
to
the
ship.
now,
on
this
particular
day,
the
arthur
herron
had
picked
up
somewhere
about
8
o'clock
or
in
that
area
in
the
evening
at
a
light
barge,
a
--
a
scow
designed
and
it
was
towing
it
back
up
the
river
to
the
place
where
the
dredging
operation
was
taking
place.
it
is
important
to
note
that
at
that
time,
the
barge
add
about
five
feet
of
freeboard.
that
means,
there
was
--
there
were
five
feet
between
--
there
was
five
feet
between
the
surface
of
the
water
and
the
deck
of
the
barge.
coming
up
the
river,
this
barge
had
two
lanterns,
open
flame,
naked
lights,
these
flamed
kerosene
lanterns,
one
on
the
forepart
and
the
other
on
the
stern
of
the
barge,
laying
flat
on
the
deck
of
the
barge.
when
--
it
was
coming
up,
i
said
it
had
about
five
feet
of
freeboard
therefore,
the
lights
were
approximately
five
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
when
it
was
coming
up,
as
it
passed
the
same
gulf
refining
area.
it
got
to
this
point
breeze,
scene
of
operations,
sometime
later
which
was
a
couple
of
miles
up
the
river
and
then
it
transferred
the
--
it
let
--
let
go
of
the
light
barge,
the
light
scow
and
picked
up
a
loaded
scow
and
transferred
the
two
naked
lights
which
had
been
burning
all
during
that
period
of
time
to
the
loaded
scow.
now,
the
loaded
scow
had
between
two
and
a
half
and
three
feet
of
freeboard,
which
meant
that
the
lights
then
came
much
closer,
about
two
feet
closer
to
the
surface
of
the
water.
it
is
conceded
hereto,
when
i
say
conceded,
i
mean
the
test
--
there
was
no
dispute
on
the
testimony
and
the
captain
of
the
said
boat
that
was
towing
the
barge
admitted
at
this
time
that
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
on
this
--
in
this
area,
the
fuse,
which
were
given
of
from
these
discharging
operations
were
heavier
than
there.
they
had
a
tendency
to
light
and
make
a
fashion
upon
the
water.
and
at
the
lower,
they
are
in
the
water
--
the
water
--
the
concentration
--
the
inflammable
concentration
appears.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
as
this
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
sir,
your
honor.
i
point
these
facts
out
because
they
are
important
in
determining
whether
or
not,
there
is
a
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
dispute
of
facts
here.
i'm
not
asking
your
honor
to
reverse
any
finding
of
fact.
what
i've
said
to
your
honors,
one
of
the
facts
which
i've
related
to
your
honors
are
undisputed
facts
in
the
record.
i
think
these
are
basic
to
the
questions.
i
didn't
want
to
just
give
your
honors
a
--
a
proposition,
a
legal
proposition
to
operate
in
a
vacuum,
sirs.
as
this
tugboat
towing
this
barge,
this
scow
on
its
starboard
side,
was
coming
down
the
river.
i
should
say
that
the
type
was
flat
and
it
was
there
for
bucking
the
tide.
the
wind
was
about
four
to
five
miles
per
hour.
very,
very
slight
wind
coming
from
the
southeast,
so
that
it
was
against
the
tug
also,
and
from
the
area
of
the
gulf
refining
up
the
river
in
the
direction
which
the
tug
was
coming,
as
this
--
oh
and
i
should
say
one
--
i
should
tell
your
honors
one
more
fact
which
has
bearing
on
it
and
that
is
that
these
seven
tankers
which
they
moored
at
these
spillways
at
the
gulf,
at
least
some
of
them,
we
were
unable
to
get
all
of
the
captains,
but
at
least
some
of
them
were
carrying
red
lights
at
the
masthead
which
was
in
accordance
with
governmental
regulations,
a
danger
signal.
i
should
say
also
that
the
--
the
lights,
the
governmental
regulations
require
that
two
lights
be
carried
on
this
kind
of
nondescript
vessel,
eight
feet
above
the
water
--
eight
feet
above
the
water.
that's
what
the
governmental
regulation
requires.
there
is
a
question
in
the
case
as
to
whether
or
not,
they
--
we
may
assume
for
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
was
to
prevent
collisions
that
the
lights
were
designed
to
prevent
collisions
although,
the
general
purpose
of
all
of
these
regulations
was
for
and
i
quoted,
“safety
of
life
at
sea."
now,
as
this
tugboat
with
its
flotilla,
where
the
barge
were
beside,
it
was
coming
down
this
river
as
it
get
--
opposite
the
gulf
refining
plant,
about
a
half
a
mile
up
to
where
these
vessels
were
discharging,
the
captain
of
the
tugboat,
captain
taylor,
called
up
one
of
the
deckhands
to
stay
and
watch
at
the
bridge
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
vessels
just
down
the
river
with
the
red
lights
showing,
and
he
went
down
for
a
cup
of
coffee.
he
left
this
deckhand
in
charge
of
the
bridge
while
he
went
down.
and
while
he
was
down,
and
he
talked
to
the
engineers
down
there
for
a
few
minutes.
while
down
there,
he
noticed
a
ribbon
of
flame
starting
up
--
on
the
barge
opposite
where
the
naked
lights
were
located
and
it
travelled
around
the
left
of
the
barge
and
then
the
whole
area
was
just
a
mass
of
flames
around
the
flotilla
within
a
matter
of
seconds
after
that.
captain
taylor
stood
transfixed
for
about
a
minute.
i
think
that's
his
testimony,
he
didn't
do
anything.
he
didn't
put
the
fire
fighting
apparatus
into
operation.
he
just
stood
there.
and
then,
sprang
into
action,
he
ran
into
the
engine
room.
he
had
been
staying
there
talking
to
the
engineer.
one
of
the
decedents
here
named,
milan,
the
gentleman,
the
--
the
member
of
the
crew
that
he
had
sent
up
to
the
bridge,
was
the
other
decedent,
his
name
was
worrell.
he
was
the
deckhand.
i
should
tell,
your
honors,
also
that
this
barge
was
of
all
steel
construction
except
the
--
the
deckhouse
which
was
wood.
as
soon
as
this
fire
started
within
a
minute
after
that,
about
a
minute
after
that,
captain
taylor
then
jumped
into
the
engine
room
with
another
man,
another
deckhand
who
was
there
and
then
he
sealed
all
the
hatches.
he
closed
the
doors,
closed
the
vents
and
everything
else
and
of
course,
the
room
became
filled
with
smoke
very
quickly.
he
had
a
telephone
connection
between
the
engine
room
and
the
wheelhouse
were
worrell
was
located
but
did
not
call
worrell
to
tell
him
to
come
down
of
the
engine
room
or
to
get
out
of
there
where
it
was
all
wood
construction.
mcginley,
the
cook,
was
also
in
his
quarters
on
another
part
of
the
vessel.
he
did
not
call
him.
he
state
the
first
order
that
he
gave
in
the
engine
room
was
to
stop
the
engines
and
then
his
second
order
was
to
reverse
the
engines,
and
his
third
order,
he
after
--
he'd
been
in
about
three
minutes
and
he
looked
out
on
the
water
and
he
saw
the
fire
coming
--
coming
down
or
practically
dying
out,
he
then
gave
his
third
order
to
stop
the
engines
again
and
then
he
yelled,
“everybody
overboard!”
he
dashed
out
of
the
door
to
the
stern,
he
was
the
first
man
out
of
the
engine
room
to
the
stern
where
he
found
the
cook
mcginley
with
a
light
boat
and
that
he
ordered
him
over
board,
he
jumped
over
behind
him.
when
he
got
to
the
dock,
the
other
two
men
on
the
engine
room
--
oh,
that's
one
point
that
i
forgot
to
tell
your
honors
about
and
that
is
that
when
he
gave
the
third
order
to
stop
the
engines
so
that
he
could
get
out
and
go
overboard,
he
didn't
get
any
response
from
the
engineer,
milan,
and
he
said
to
himself,
he
thought
then
that
milan
had
been
overcome
by
smoke,
so
that
he
reached
over
himself
and
he
shut
the
controls
off
so
the
engines
were
stopped
and
then
he
went
out
leaving
milan
there,
him
thinking
that
milan
was
overcome
by
smoke.
as
i
said,
he
left
everybody
else
in
the
engine
room,
went
over
the
side
and
so
fast
that
he
go
that
by
--
that
by
the
time
the
other
man,
the
oiler
and
the
other
deckhand
got
to
the
stern,
he
was
already
on
the
--
on
the
dock,
the
light
of
dock
at
the
gulf
where
the
gulf
employees
were
ready
with
hoses
and
so
on.
he
ordered
them.
he
yelled
to
them
to
come
over
and
they
jumped
overboard
and
swam
to
the
dock.
now,
the
court
below
--
we
contended
and
the
court
below
that
there
was
not
only
unseaworthiness,
but
there
was
negligence.
there
was
negligence
and
that
the
naked
light
should
not
of
--
never
have
been
used
in
that
area
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
and
that
she
was
not
adequate.
she
was
not
--
she
was
in
unsafe
place.
it
constituted
--
those
naked
lights
constituted
an
unsafe
appliance
in
that
area
where
you
have
the
petroleum
refineries
and
where
vessels
were
loading
and
discharging
liquid
petroleum
and
particularly,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
have
these
signs,
i
don't
know
if
that
--
that
makes
--
that
would
be
necessary,
but
it
only
emphasized
the
--
the
danger
that
was
involved.
the
court
below
rejected
all
of
the
contentions
of
liability.
he
said
that
this
vessel
was
in
a
sudden
emergency.
he
said
that
it
was
not
considered
to
be
a
danger
area
and
here
is
where
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
comes
in.
he
said
that
it
wasn't
considered
to
be
a
danger
area
and
therefore,
it
was
not
negligent.
the
word
that
he
used
was,
"negligent".
therefore,
it
was
not
negligent
for
this
vessel
to
have
carried
these
naked
lights
in
this
situation.
he
did
find
also
that
the
configuration
was
caused
by
the
naked
lights
and
he
said
that
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
disaster.
the
violation
of
the
regulation
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
disaster.
he
refused
liability
for
the
--
because
of
the
violation
of
the
regulation,
because
he
said
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
was
to
prevent
collisions
and
not
to
prevent
fires.
and
therefore,
he
said
that
the
fact
that
the
--
the
lights
were
carried
at
the
lower
level,
despite
the
fact
that
because
they
were
carried
at
the
lower
level,
they
caused
the
fire
and
you
couldn't
base
liability
on
that.
i
should
have
told
your
honors
that
the
testimony
shows
that
the
higher
up,
the
light
scow,
the
less
danger
there
would
have
been
of
any
fire
of
the
--
they're
being
a
dangerous
concentration
at
eight
feet.
the
testimony
showed
and
the
court
so
found
that
--
had
the
lights
been
carried
higher,
the
fire
might
had
been
averted.
our
position
was
that
they
should
have
carried
battery
lights
in
that
area
and
not
even
taken
any
chance
with
--
with
these
naked
lights
at
all.
we
also
contended
there
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
because
this
particular
captain
was
not
adequate
to
the
situation
that
he
was
not
equal
in
disposition
to
other
seamen
in
the
same
category
that
while
--
anyone
would
have
been
frightened
that
--
anyone
would've
been
scared
under
the
same
circumstances,
nevertheless,
we
felt
that
as
captain
of
the
vessel,
he
owed
a
duty
to
those
men,
to
the
man
up
on
the
bridge
that
he
had
left
there
who
was
bound
to
stand
duty
until
relieved
and
to
milan
that
he
thought
was
overcome
by
smoke
in
the
engine
room,
we
say
that
as
a
master
of
the
vessel,
he
owed
a
greater
duty
even
--
despite
the
fact
that
he
might
had
been
scared.
however
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
we
--
yes,
your
honor,
we
had
those
two
but
we
--
we--
have
not
urged
in
this
petition
for
certiorari.
we
have
chosen
to
limit
this
argument
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
carrying
of
those
lights
constituted
an
unseaworthy
condition
under
those
circumstances
and
whether
or
not
the
violation
of
the
regulation
was
negligence
per
se
despite
the
fact
that
the
injury
itself
was
not
contemplated
within
the
--
within
the
purpose
of
the
regulation.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
we
--
we
in
court
below
did,
sir.
but
in
this
court,
we
felt
that
we
should
narrow
the
issues
and
therefore,
those
were
the
two
points
that
we
presented.
if
your
honors
find
any
further
facts,
i
--
i
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
your
honors
were
wrong,
i
personally
feel
that
this
was
gross
negligence
that
this
vessel
was
unseaworthy
also
because
this
captain
was
not
equal
in
disposition
under
seamanship
in
accordance
with
your
honors
decision
on
the
(inaudible)
case.
those
are
my
contentions.
but
as
i
said,
i
do
not
want
to
burden
to
this
court
with
argument.
i
thought
that
my
arguments
on
the
naked
lights
and
on
the
violation
of
statute
were
so
strong
that
i
was
willing
to
hang
my
head
on
those
two
points,
without
intending
to
--
to
indicate
in
the
slightest
degree
that
i
have
no
confidence
on
those
points
at
all.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
and
i
--
i
will
make
this,
i
know
my
time
is
limited.
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
does
not
contemplate
any
considerations
of
negligence
whatsoever.
the
court
below,
as
your
honors
will
note
from
his
opinion
said,
"he
was
treating
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
with
a
negligence
together
and
they
both
depended
upon
whether
or
not
the
area
was
considered
to
be
a
dangerous
area."
now
that
doctrine
was
completely
foreign
to
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
as
this
court
has
announced
the
--
in
the
mahnich
case
and
the
sieracki
case
and
all
of
these
succeeding
cases
which
have
come
before
this
court.
in
mahnich,
this
court
said,
"that
due
diligence
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness."
it
is
an
absolute
form
of
--
of
duty,
of
obligation
and
if
in
fact,
the
place
of
work
where
the
appliance
itself
is
unsafe,
then
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
--
whether
the
shipowner
knew
or
didn't
know
about
it
or
whether
he
could
have
known
about
it,
as
for
example
on
the
sieracki
case
where
there
was
a
--
a
defective
shackle
involved
which
could
not
have
been
discovered
by
any
reasonable
inspection.
this
court
held
that
it
was
in
fact
an
unsafe
appliance
and
has
made
no
difference
whether
the
shipowner
could
or
could
not
have
ascertained
its
effectiveness
and
therefore,
it
was
a
breach
of
the
warranty.
i
might
invite
your
honors'
attention
to
the
decision
by
chief
judge
parker
and
by
judge
learned
hand
in
the
(inaudible)
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief
in
which
he
points
out
the
distinction
between
a
liability
under
warranty
and
a
liability
under
negligence.
he
says
the
warranty
is
a
promise
that
a
fact
is
so,
in
this
situation,
is
as
a
promise
that
the
--
that
the
ship
is
seaworthy,
that
in
fact,
it
is
safe
under
the
circumstances
as
distinguished
from
considerations
of
due
--
due
diligence,
the
reasonable
care
to
make
it
safe.
that
is
as
relevant
only
in
connection
with
determining
the
negligence,
but
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever,
in
determining
the
question
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
now
on
the
--
on
the
second
questions
so
far
as
the
violation
of
the
regulation
is
concerned,
this
court
treated
that
subject
and
six
different
cases
and
i
believe
finally
concluded
in
the
--
its
--
its
decision
in
the
--
and
set
the
rule
at
rest
in
the
davis
versus
wolfe
case,
which
i've
cited
to
your
honors
and
in
the
coray
versus
southern
transportation
company
case.
prior
to
that
time,
there
were
series
of
four
cases,
the
kennedy
and
the
(inaudible)
case
wherein
a
--
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
of
a
regulation
where
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
liability
because
it
was
incidental.
the
--
the
violation
of
regulation
was
not
the
proximate
cause,
but
it
was
only
the
incidental
matter.
in
the
two
following
cases
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief
in
this
court
came
the
layton
and
the
gotschall
cases,
where
just
the
reverse
was
true.
finally,
the
question
came
up
again
in
this
court
in
davis
versus
wolfe.
and
this
court
laid
down
a
rule
that
if
in
fact,
the
--
the
breach
of
the
regulation
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
injury,
then
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
injury
was
not
contemplated
within
the
original
purpose
of
the
regulation.
and
--
and
there
--
as
liability
float
from
that
fact
alone.
this
court
confirmed
that
doctrine
in
the
coray
case.
we
therefore,
suggest
to
your
honors
that
upon
either
ground
--
either
upon
the
ground
that
--
both
upon
the
ground
of
unseaworthiness,
there
was
a
clear
breach
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
here
and
the
violation
of
the
regulation
as
found
by
the
court
below
since
it
was
found
by
the
court
below
to
be
the
proximate
cause
of
the
accident,
then
the
fact
that
it
may
not
had
been
contemplated
within
the
original
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
regulation.
for
that
ground
alone
too,
liability
should
have
been
imposed.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
sir.
i
have
it
set
forth
in
my
brief
on
page
8,
sir.
on
page
8,
if
i
may
read
it
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
page
8
of
my
brief
sir,
my
brief
on
certiorari
--
on
the
--
the
blue
briefs.
that's
the
one.
may
i
read
it,
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
--
the
--
the
quotation,
sir,
as
--
from
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
all
there
is
in
this
opinion
regarding
unseaworthiness
and
negligence.
this
is
his
whole
finding
to
the
extent
that
applies
to
negligence
as
well
as
unseaworthiness.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
oh,
for
that,
sir
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
court
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
that's
exactly
what
he
said,
sir.
and
i'm
picking
out
of
those
opinion
or
just
a
moment.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
i
have
made
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
i
just
like
to
reserve
the
minute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
--
for
rebuttal,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
sir.
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
last
question
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
jones
act
didn't
more
than
merely
create
a
right
of
action
for
death,
sir.
if
i
may
quote
it
and
i
think
this
is
verbatim,
it
said,
"that
in
such
action,
all
statutes
relating
to
railway
employees
shall
apply.”
in
other
words,
all
of
these
regulations,
all
of
these
statutes
which
apply
to
railway
employees
are
equally
applicable
to
merchant
seaman
by
its
present
corporation
into
the
maritime
law
by
the
jones
act.
so
that
your
honors
question
before
mr.
justice
harlan
fits
right
in
here.
if
it's
a
statutory
violation
involving
the
fela,
a
liability
can
be
predicated
on
that
in
this
kind
of
an
action
because
the
jones
act
incorporated
into
the
maritime
law,
all
of
the
statutes
relating
to
railway
employees
so
that
the
remedy
today
is
as
this
court
said
at
panama
railroad
versus
johnson,
the
maritime
law
as
modified
by
the
jones
act,
so
that
the
seaman
today
have
a
right
to
recover
for
unseaworthiness
and,
or
for
negligence.
and
in
that
negligence
action,
all
of
these
railway
employees
are
--
its
actions
are
applicable.
now,
in
this
situation,
precisely
the
same
interpretation
which
this
court
gave
to
the
fela
cases
and
the
coray
and
in
the
davis
case
where
it
said
that
if
the
--
if
the
violation
is
the
proximate
cause,
then
liability
flows
even
though
the
injury
itself
is
not
within
the
intended
purpose
of
the
act.
and
on
that
point
if
i
may
read
to
your
honors
just
what
justice
kirkpatrick
said
there's
only
one
line,
two
lines.
my
--
my
friend
just
forgot
--
he
read
part
of
it.
he
said
that
the
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
at
page
416,
sir.
the
end
of
the
second
paragraph
where
my
friend
read
that
the
--
the
cause
of
the
fire
was
the
ignition
of
highly
inflammable
vapor
lying
above
and
extends
of
accumulation
of
some
petroleum
product
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
river
and
that's
where
he
stopped.
but
the
court
goes
on
to
say
which
was
touched
off
by
an
open
flame
kerosene
lantern
carried
on
a
deck
of
the
scow
at
the
rear
point
corner.
so
that
--
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
proximate
cause
of
this
accident
was
this
naked
light
and
even
holds
that
there
was
probity
if
there
were
liabilities
so
that
these
made
liability,
there
would
be
probity.
so
that
actually
in
this
case,
we
apply
all
of
the
same
constructions
that
are
applicable
to
the
railway
employees.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
--
as
i
read
the
moran
case,
there's
nothing
in
there,
sirs,
which
is
in
anyway
in
conflict
with
what
we
have
said
here.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
as
--
as
i
read
the
moran
case,
there
was
a
question
of
a
collision
and
there
were
other
factors
involved.
the
precise
situation
involved
here
was
not
involved
there.
first
of
all,
it
was
not
a
personal
injury
case.
and
your
honors,
i've
treated
fela,
a
personal
injury
cases
particularly
over
the
fela
with
some
different
constructions.
in
other
words,
where
personal
injuries
are
involved,
a
different
construction
is
warranted
that
where
a
mere
collision
is
involved.
that
is
the
--
the
fela
statute
are
entitled
to
a
--
to
a
more
liberal
construction.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
davis
and
in
the
coray
cases
and
even
in
the
line
and
the
other
four
cases
where
--
and
two
situations
the
--
this
court
held
the
contrary
because
the
accident
was
simply
--
that
is
a
breach
of
the
violation
was
only
incidental
and
not
the
proximate
cause.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
this
is
a
maritime
case,
but
which
has
all
of
the
advantages
over
an
fela
case,
without
exception,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
at
the
--
this
court
said,
if
i
may
use
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it's
a
--
it's
a
maritime
case.
it's
--
there
--
it
never
changes
your
honor,
despite
the
fact
that
all
of
the
statutes
are
--
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
--
to
define
that,
when
this
--
when
the
constitution
of
this
country
was
adopted,
this
court
said
in
(inaudible)
case
that
it
embodied
within
the
constitution
the
maritime
law
as
it
then
existed
and
congress,
not
even
congress
would
change
that
law.
that
is,
it
could
not
take
anything
out
inherently
which
belonged
in
it
and
they
couldn't
change
the
characteristic
features
of
the
law
without
a
constitutional
amendment.
that's
what
came
up
right
in
the
panama
railroad
versus
johnson
case.
now,
when
the
--
when
the
jones
act
was
--
was
enacted,
it
held
that
the
--
all
of
the
statutes
relating
to
railway
employees
were
incorporated
into
the
general
remedy.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
change
at
any.
it
supplemented
it.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
provide
an
alternative,
but
it
supplemented
what
--
what
the
old
maritime
law
already
provided
for
and
this
court
held
in
panama
railroad
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
this
court
held
that
the
--
that
the
incorporation
of
the
fela
into
the
maritime
law
did
not
change
the
characteristic
features.
had
that
been
so,
this
court
would've
held
the
jones
act
unconstitutional.
that
was
the
very
question
involved
in
the
panama
railroad.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
it
was
intended
that
whatever
--
whatever
benefit
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
if
this
court
said
that
whatever
benefits
the
railway
employees
got,
it
was
intended.
congress
intended
that
seamen
should
have
it,
because
the
statute
reads
literally
just
that
way.
that
all
statutes
relating
to
railway
employees
shall
not
be
applicable
in
these
actions
brought
by
this
merchant
seaman.
now
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
but
the
remedy
is
still
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
remedy
is
still
the
general
--
there
is
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you,
sir.
regarding
the
gulf
oil
suit,
sir,
we
started
an
action
against
the
gulf
oil.
gulf
oil
says
there
are
a
lot
of
refineries
on
this
river.
there
is
one
across
the
way,
esso
refining.
there's
another
one
just
a
little
bit
further
down
the
river,
the
atlantic
refining
where
this
dredging
operation
was
taking
place
and
there
are
others
on
the
river.
now,
they
say
that
it
could
--
that
gas
could've
come
from
anywhere.
we
say
that
the
party
to
sue
is
the
party
that
took
us
into
that
area.
he
had
the
obligation.
he
had
the
safety
of
these
people
right
on
his
hand.
that
is
the
shipowner.
and
it
was
his
responsibility
as
this
court
has
said
many,
many
times
in
these
cases.
it
is
the
primary
responsibility
to
look
after
the
safety
of
this
people
that
is
of
the
shipowner.
if
he
has
any
right
of
action
over
against
gulf
or
anybody
else,
he
could've
pleaded
them,
there's
a
real
reason
why
he
didn't
have
plead
them.
the
same
underwriter
represents
gulf
and
this
--
and
this
--
this
company,
travelers
insurance
company
--
that's
why
they
weren't
pleaded
in
this
situation.
now,
i
--
i
trust
that
i've
answered
your
honor,
justice
burton's
question.
i
only
want
to
make
one
more
statement,
sirs
and
i
will
conclude.
i
have
listened
to
my
friend
here
with
great
attention
when
he
talks
about
the
limitation
of
liability
statutes.
i
--
i
frankly
cannot
understand
why
he
introduced
it.
i
may
say
since
i'm
member
of
the
subcommittee
that
he
referred
to
before,
the
maritime
law
association,
there
has
been
no
action
taken.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
--
this
committee
is
hostile
to
it,
but
they
have
referred
it
for
further
study.
but
i
still
don't
know
why
it's
in
this
case.
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
warranty.
it
only
has
to
do
where
the
question
of
whether
or
not
in
limiting
liability,
the
value
will
be
greater
or
less
of
the
vessel,
that
is
fund
for
distribution
in
cases
involving
limitation
of
liabilities,
sir.
