of

petitioners,
versus
john

murff,
district
director
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
services.
mr.
gim,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
last
statement
again,
mr.
gim?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
are
the
government's
doctors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
were
the
experts
employed
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what
grounds
do
you
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
is
a
fair
--
fair
statement
of
the
position
of
the
doctor
--
the
government
doctor
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
tests
here.
mr.
--
mr.
gim
said
that
that
he
wouldn't
stand
by
it.
he
said
they
couldn't
be
relied
upon
because
of
there
--
what
is
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
is
your
recollection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
won't
be
necessary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
government
cite
any
case
where
they
have
birth
certificates
where
they
were
not
given
blood
tests?
chief
justice
earl
warren
offer
to
prove
what
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
because
they
have
--
they
have
birth
certificates?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
were
there
some
other
reasons?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you
in
the
administrative
proceedings
and
in
the
court
below?
was
this
position
of
the
government
frankly
taken
there
to
the
effect
that
--
that
you
had
required
these
blood
tests
only
from
chinese,
not
from
others
and
--
and
for
the
reasons
that
you
have
mentioned
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
the
chinese
that
they
recognize
this,
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
the
--
that
they
blood
tested
all
chinese
and
that
they
did
not
blood
test
anyone
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
take
that
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
very
frankly
--
you
say
here
very
frankly
we
--
we're
not
a
part
from
mr.
gim
on
these
facts,
we
did
do
this
in
1951.
we
did
blood
test
only
chinese.
we
did
not
blood
test
others.
now,
i
want
--
all
i
want
to
know
is
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding
as
the
government
did
in
that
or
have
you
taken
--
have
they
taken
below
a
different
position
that
try
to
establish
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
that
sense
if
you
require
the
chinese
to
have
the
blood
test
but
not
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
no
one
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
such
an
extent
to
make
into
practice
or
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
then
mr.
davis?
did
they
have
--
did
they
have
an
opportunity
to
litigate
their
case
on
that
basis
in
the
administrative
proceedings
and
in
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
--
there's
no
question
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
this
--
just
one
more
question
--
this
report
that
mr.
gim
mentioned,
the
consular
report,
was
that
similar
to
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
on
what
theory
does
it
come
here
then
if
it
--
if
it
would
establish
lack
of
discrimination,
now
why
wasn't
it
presented
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
may
be
the
necessity
for
finger
printing
--
not
finger
printing
but
blood
testing
chinese
and
not
other
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
made
four
years
later.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
might
be
a
difference
here
because
mr.
gim
said
that
the
government
refused
to
--
at
the
hearings
to
state
what
the
--
what
the
practices
were
and
what
the
orders
and
directions
to
the
--
to
the
government
offices
were
so
far
as
these
blood
tests
were
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gim,
do
you
want
to
respond?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
doctor
is
that?
is
that
the
government
doctor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
used
by
the
government,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
would
you
answer
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
whether
this
was
once
classified
and
then
declassified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
determine
if
this
was
classified
at
one
time
and
if
declassified
to
the
extent
that
it
has
been
when?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
you
answer
this
question,
mr.
davis?
is
there
anything
in
that
report
that
has
not
been
available
to
the
petitioner
on
his
way
up
to
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
it
was
only
written
a
year
or
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
information
in
there.
did
he
put
in
there
any
information
that
would
help
the
cause
of
the
government
in
this
court
that
was
not
available
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
