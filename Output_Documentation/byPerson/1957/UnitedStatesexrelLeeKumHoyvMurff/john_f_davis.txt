mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
a
very
narrow
issue
and
that
is
as
limited
by
the
author
of
the
court
in
granting
certiorari
and
that
is
whether
or
not
there
is
racial
--
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
these
petitioners
by
use
of
the
blood
test.
under
this
question,
there
is
really
no
question
before
the
court
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
record
with
respect
to
the
facts
shown
by
the
blood
test.
what
happened
is
that
the
blood
test,
the
evidence
that
was
introduced,
showed
that
two
of
the
children
could
not
have
been
the
children
of
the
alleged
parents.
this
was
attacked
at
the
second
hearing
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
on
cross-examination
they
extracted
some
of
the
testimony
which
counsel
has
referred
to.
the
hearing
examiner,
special
inquiry
officer,
found
that
on
the
basis
of
this
test,
they
could
not
be
the
children
of
the
alleged
parent
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirmed
that
holding.
there
is
no
holding
by
the
district
court
with
respect
to
that,
to
that
fact.
he
eventually
decided
the
case
on
the
grounds
of
discrimination
and
i
submit
that
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
the
issue
of
the
sufficiency
and
the
accuracy
of
the
blood
test
is
not
here
at
this
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
don't
--
i
do
not
so
read
this
testimony.
the
test,
there
were
--
there
were
inaccuracies
in
some
of
the
test.
the
two
tests
are
different
and
there's
no
question
that
the
evidence
is
not
as
--
because
of
the
discrepancy
between
the
two
tests,
one
could
--
one
could
possibly
have
said
that
they
needed
a
blood
test.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
judge
when
he
sent
it
back
for
the
first
time
suggested
that
there
should
be
further
test
and
opportunity
was
given
to
the
petitioners
to
have
a
third
test
in
order
that
any
possible
inconsistency
could
be
removed
and
the
petitioners
refuse
to
submit
to
a
--
to
a
third
test.
actually,
the
first
and
second
tests
were
entirely
consistent
with
respect
to
the
blood
grouping
under
the
a,
b
and
o
classifications.
there
was
no
discrepancy
in
those.
there
was
a
discrepancy
with
respect
to
the
more
difficult
test
which
i
call
the
m
and
the
n,
and
the
mn
test.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
the
test
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
testimony
is
that
the
test
in
this
--
there
was
testimony
to
support
these
tests.
i
mean
that's
when
it
went
back
the
first
time,
that
was
--
they
--
they
were
given
the
chance
to
attack
them
and
there
was
a
testimony
in
both
ways
with
respect
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
test.
what
i'm
urging
this
court
is
that
that
issue
is
no
longer
before
us.
it
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
it's
--
the
issue
before
us
is
--
is
a
much
broader
issue
than
that
factual
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
regret
that
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
summarize
that
evidence
for
your
honor
at
the
moment.
i
would
have
--
i
would
have
to
reexamine
it
and
submit
it
in
an
additional
memorandum
only
if
the
court
pleases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
--
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
feeling
that
this
was
not
the
issue
before
the
court,
i
would
hesitate
now
to
try
to
summarize
what
the
doctor
said
without
--
without
reviewing
it
again.
i
think
that
basically
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
course
that
is
right.
what
i
am
saying
is
simply
this
that
there
was
disputed
evidence
before
the
triers
of
fact
that
it
was
determined
and
that
this
was
not
an
issue.
it
was
not
determined
adversely
to
the
government
at
any
stage,
at
any
stage
in
the
proceeding.
now,
if
there
were
no
evidence
there
was
accountable
error
in
spite
of
the
limitation
on
certiorari
or
any
other
reason
why
the
court
should
of
course
correct
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'd
be
--
i'd
be
glad
to
review
this
evidence
and
give
it
to
the
court.
i
--
i
have
not
believed
that
that
was
the
issue
before
the
court
and
i
have
not
briefed
it
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
do
--
to
summarize
it
without
further
studying
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
the
blood
test?
yes,
indeed.
the
inquiry
officer
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
both
made
the
findings
on
the
blood
test.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
the
district
court
never
passed,
never
specifically
passed
on
the
blood
test.
they
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
it
was
proper
to
use
blood
test
under
any
circumstances
and
they
denied
an
appeal
without
stating
why
but
they
--
i
mean
they
denied
the
--
the
ground
that
the
petitioners
in
habeas
corpus
had
raised
on
the
ground
of
the
insufficiency
and
returned
it
only
on
the
ground
and
granted
the
writ
only
on
the
ground
of
discrimination.
then
there
was
a
cross-appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
again
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
government
on
all
grounds
except
including
the
discrimination
ground.
i
think
that
really
mr.
gim
and
i
are
not
too
far
apart
on
even
on
what
the
basic
--
on
what
the
basic
facts
are
with
respect
to
the
--
the
practice
at
the
time
these
particular
petitioners
applied
for
admission.
i
am
prepared
to
admit
the
fact
that
at
the
time
these
children
applied
for
admission
in
new
york,
they
were
given
blood
test
which
in
all
likelihood
would
not
have
been
required
of
them,
had
they
been
children
coming
from
western
europe.
and
i'm
also
prepared
to
accept
the
proposition
that
at
this
period
of
time,
the
immigration
service
as
a
matter
of
practice,
applied
these
blood
tests
to
chinese
--
to
persons
of
chinese
extraction
generally
applying
for
admission
to
citizens
even
though
they
did
not
make
these
tests
with
respect
to
applicants
of
other
races.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
means
that
there
was
necessarily
an
unconstitutional
race
discrimination
practiced
against
the
chinese.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
irrespective.
i
would
admit
that
there
were
cases
where
there
were
chinese
with
birth
certificates
--
there
were
general
cases
where
they
gave
it
to
chinese
with
birth
certificates
as
to
the
cases
that
were
cited
and
probably
other
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
well
in
the
--
in
the
application
for
rehearing
why
we
present,
we
offer
--
made
the
offer
of
proof
whether
that's
reopened.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
there
were,
i
believe,
it
was
50
cases
where
they
have
been
admitted
without
blood
test
--
chinese.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
was
because
the
immigration
authorities
were
satisfied
on
the
evidence
that
they
were
citizens
without
the
necessity
of
blood
testing.
it
wasn't
only
on
birth
certificates
presumably.
it
was
on
the
records
as
i
know.
but
it
is
our
position
here
that
there
are
very
special
circumstances
which
are
applicable
because
of
the
attempts
of
many
persons
in
a
position
similar
to
that
of
these
petitioners
to
come
into
the
country
illegally
and
that
therefore
special
precautions
against
this
type
of
fraud
were
necessary
in
this
type
of
situation.
historically,
there
has
always
been
resentment
by
the
chinese
against
the
american
immigration
policy
arising
particularly
from
the
chinese
exclusion
act
of
1882.
and
historically,
the
chinese
who
are
normally
law
abiding
citizens
have
felt
no
compulsion
against
gaining
entry
into
this
country
by
fraud.
and
actually,
relying
upon
the
destruction
of
the
birth
records
in
san
francisco
at
the
time
of
the
san
francisco
fire,
enough
persons
of
chinese
ancestry
claimed
to
have
been
born
in
the
united
states
so
that
if
all
of
their
claims
were
true,
each
chinese
women
legally
in
the
united
states
who
have
to
had
to
have
given
birth
to
800
chinese
in
order
to
make
that
to
permit
this
number
of
people
to
begin.
the
repeal
of
the
exclusion
act
in
1943
has
not
really
helped
the
situation
very
much.
the
quota
for
chinese
is
105
persons
a
year
and
so
the
pressure
for
admittance
continues
to
be
very
great.
on
the
other
hand,
the
opportunity
of
checking
the
voracity
of
applicants
for
entry
of
citizens
is
small.
customarily,
they
claim
that
they
come
from
rural
sections
of
china
where
there
are
no
birth
records
and
in
fact
they
frequently
present
no
written
evidence
of
any
kind
as
it
was
true
in
this
case.
since
the
communist
have
taken
over
the
mainland
of
china,
there's
no
opportunity
at
all
to
make
a
field
check
in
the
places
where
the
applicants
claim
that
they
were
born.
difficulties
in
language
and
in
translation,
in
the
customs,
and
the
chinese
calendar
as
against
our
calendar,
the
names,
all
make
it
difficult
to
check
or
to
detect
fabrication.
and
then
there
is
one
other
feature
which
makes
it
particularly
difficult
and
that
is
the
customary
pattern
of
citizens
of
chinese
ancestry
returning
to
china
to
marry.
there
were
fewer
chinese
women
in
this
country
than
chinese
men
because
of
the
early
history
and
because
of
the
exclusion
act
and
so
it
became
customary
for
american
citizens
of
chinese
ancestry
to
return
to
china
to
marry,
remained
a
year
or
two
and
since
their
wives
could
not
return
with
them,
they'll
come
back
to
the
country
and
perhaps
make
repeated
trips
back
to
china
to
see
their
wives
and
families.
and
then
as
the
children
grew
old
enough,
the
children
would
then
apply
for
admission
as
american
citizens.
their
wives
wouldn't
--
their
wives
wouldn't
be
an
american
citizen
and
couldn't
come
in.
the
children
would
be
american
citizens
by
derivation
and
would
be
admissible
as
citizens.
now,
this
makes
a
great
difficulty
in
determining
the
bona
fides
of
the
applications
and
the
immigration
officials
and
the
state
department
people
who
had
to
issue
passports
and
travel
documents
in
china
became
convinced
that
much
of
the
evidence
which
was
being
produced
in
many
of
the
applicants
who
were
appearing
before
them
were
not
genuine,
and
that
there
was
a
tremendous
fraud
being
--
being
operated
through
filling
the
possible
vacancies
that
the
people
who
were
claimed
to
have
been
born
with
other
individuals
who
wished
to
come
to
this
country.
and
so,
it
was
that
in
1951,
the
state
department
instituted
a
program
requiring
a
blood
check
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
applicant
was
in
fact
the
son
of
the
father
whom
as
he
claimed.
the
--
the
program
turned
up
a
great
number
of
cases
in
which
the
applicant
was
not
the
child
of
the
alleged
father
and
the
immigration
people
then
undertook
the
same
type
of
program
when
the
applicants
knock
for
admission
at
the
door
here
in
this
country.
and
as
it
was
in
1952,
just
about
the
time
that
these
petitioners
came
to
new
york
that
the
immigration
service
commenced
the
program
of
--
of
requiring
blood
test.
and
because
of
this
history
which
i
have
given
you,
it
was
not
--
it's
not
strange
that
the
--
where
they
started
this
program,
where
they
actually
made
these
requirements
was
in
the
case
of
chinese
because
it
was
in
the
case
of
chinese
that
we
have
these
peculiar
circumstances
of
tremendous
pressure
for
inference
and
this
readymade
opportunity
for
fraud.
now,
at
the
present
time,
this
program
is
not
in
any
way
limited
to
chinese.
there
are
no
instructions,
there
are
no
regulations
that
require
it
to
be
applied
to
chinese
particularly
and
it
is,
in
fact,
applied
across
the
board
to
any
applicants
where
paternity
is
an
issue
and
where
this
type
of
testing
is
appropriate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well
not,
not
as
a
clearly
as
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
because
even
the
facts
are
not
as
clear
as
that.
but
the
position
taken
was
that
it
was
--
it
was
recognized
all
along,
this
was
primarily
a
chinese
problem
but
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
and
so
did
the
--
and
so
did
the
expert,
mr.
friedman
who
testified
for
the
--
for
the
government.
he
--
he
asserted
and
he
gave
the
--
and
the
immigration
files
are
not
prepared
with
this
blood
testing,
on
the
basis
of
blood
testing
statistics
of
it.
he
can't
reach
and
find
how
many
times
blood
testing
was
used
and
how
many
times
it
wasn't.
he,
out
of
his
experience,
testified
as
to
four
cases
and
only
four,
but
four
cases
where
he
said
it
has
been
used
with
non-chinese
applicants.
he
was
cross-examined
with
respect
to
these
cases
and
it
seems
possible
that
two
of
them
seems
probable
indeed
that
two
of
them
may
have
been
negroes
if
that
has
been
of
importance.
they
weren't
tested
because
they
were
negroes
but
at
least
they
were
not
white
persons.
so
far
as
i
know,
that
evidence
still
stands
that
it
was
used
in
some
other
cases
and
these
four
cases
were
the
ones
that
the
witness
could
testify
as
to
--
but
the
government
never
did
established
that
it
was
used
generally
in
more
than
these
four
cases.
now,
originally,
the
statements
were
made
that
the
basis
was
lack
of
trust.
there's
is
no
question
about
that.
that
was
put
in
--
in
an
affidavit
in
response
to
--
to
a
claim.
later,
the
--
maybe
on
reconsideration
and
consultation
with
others
in
the
immigration
service,
the
testimony
in
the
final
hearing
was
consistent
--
entirely
consistent
with
the
testimony
which
the
position
we're
taking
today
that
it
was
a
special
situation
which
required
this
kind
of
testing.
that
--
that
is
the
testimony
of
mr.
friedman
before
the
hearing
--
hearing
officer
on
this
question
of
discrimination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
no
and
that
isn't
the
position.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
took
the
position
in
those
hearings
that
it
--
that
it
wasn't
limited
to
chinese.
they
definitely
took
the
position
that
it
was
the
circumstances
that
because
it
wasn't
limited
to
chinese
in
the
hearings
before
the
--
before
the
hearing
officers
in
the
immigration
service.
and
my
position
today
is
not
that
it
was
required
of
all
chinese
or
that
there
were
no
chinese
that
were
exempted.
my
position
is
instead
that
with
few
exceptions,
i
mean
it's
the
same
as
it
was
in
that
case
that
primarily,
the
chinese
is
a
question
of
testing
and
that
primarily
and
that
by
and
large,
all
of
the
chinese
under
these
circumstances
were
given
the
test.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
--
well
--
and
by
and
large
no
one
else
but
there
are
cases
where
it
was
used
with
others
that
were
in
that
case,
and
that
was
--
and
that
was
argued
before
the
--
before
the
inquiry
officer
and
it's
our
position
today
that
--
that
there
were
instances
where
it
was
used
with
others.
that
is
my
position
today
before
this
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
wouldn't
say
it
was
the
practice,
it
was
the
exception.
it
was
the
exception.
mr.
john
f.
davis
so
that
if
this
isn't
a
black
and
white
situation,
the
situation
is
today
as
it
was
then
except
that
with
more
consideration
of
the
files
and
the
circumstances,
we
feel
that
we
cannot
make
this
a
broader
claim
as
it
was
made
in
that
case
that
it
was
done
across
the
board.
in
all
cases,
it
wasn't.
it
was
done
only
in
exceptional
cases
with
respect
to
those
which
were
not
chinese.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
precisely
my
position.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
they
did.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
that
was
not
(voice
overlap)
court
below.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
the
status
of
the
1955
so
it
couldn't
have
been
prepared
that
a
kind
of
evidence
was
taken
in
the
case
below.
this
is
a
relatively
reason
to
report.
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor
that
this
is
the
type
of
material
which
is
required
to
be
introduced
as
evidence
in
the
case.
the
material
in
this
report
has
no
reference
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
particular
case.
the
material
in
this
report
is
the
--
well
it's
described
in
our
response
to
the
motion
as
the
climate.
it
describes
the
climate
in
which
this
practice
took
place.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
truth
or
falsity
of
this
report
is
really
not
an
issue.
if
it
has
been
introduced,
i
would
not
think
it
would
have
been
properly
subject
to
cross-examination
because
if
every
fact
in
this
report
were
false
and
make
no
mistake,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
conceding
falsity
in
this
report
but
if
every
fact
in
this
report
were
false,
this
was
still
the
basic
belief
of
the
immigration
people
and
of
the
--
of
the
state
department
people
and
the
reason
--
the
reason
under
which
the
--
by
reason
of
which
they
adopted
this
blood
testing
technique.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
--
that
--
that's
right.
they
didn't
do
it
on
the
basis
of
this
report
but
these
are
the
--
this
is
the
description
of
the
practices
which
they
had
in
mind.
this
report
is
no
different
than
making
reference
to
other
current
materials
which
described
the
--
the
matters
on
which
you
may
take
judicial
notice.
it's
--
well,
it's
different
and
that
it
is
an
official
government
report
and
therefore
carries
somewhat
more
weight
but
it
is
a
background
factual
material
such
as
what's
introduced
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
hours
of
labor
and
wage
cases
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
substantiate
the
reasonableness
of
limiting
hours
of
--
hours
of
labor
for
women.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
friedman
who
testified
at
the
report
at
the
hearing,
testified
as
to
what
the
practices
were
and
testified
that
there
was
no
discrimination
and
there
was
a
full
--
there
was
a
full
hearing
on
this
matter.
what
he
refused
to
do
was
to
turn
over
files
or
to
make
available
the
operating
instructions
which
the
field
force
was
suppose
to
use
in
testing
applicants.
there
were
no
instructions
or
regulations
with
respect
to
exclusion
cases.
there
were
some
operating
instructions
with
respect
to
other
types
of
cases
which
set
forth
the
--
what
were
called
operating
instructions.
it
was
the
field
methods
of
testing
and
it
was
felt
that
if
there
were
disclosures
made
as
to
what
the
field
members,
the
officials
were
told
to
do
in
particular
instances,
that
then
the
applicants
would
know
what
to
avoid
but
they
weren't
instructions
which
were
directly
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
were
not
instructions
which
dealt
with
exclusions,
which
they
dealt
with
the
kind
of
proceeding
which
was
here
involved
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
there
were
--
but
there
were
instructions
with
respect
to
visas
and
certificates
of
citizenship.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
with
respect
to
--
and
whether
--
with
respect
to
blood
test
and
that
was
one
of
them
which
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
should
be
used
with
chinese.
it
made
a
specific
reference
to
the
chinese.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
think
that
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
blood
testing
which
was
imposed
specifically
with
respect
to
chinese
is
based
upon
race
prejudice
or
whether
it
has
a
reasonable
basis
for
falsifications
apart
from
race
prejudice.
i
think
that
you
have
to
--
we
have
to
consider
whether
this
case
falls
within
the
line
of
the
yick
wo
case
against
hopkins
where
specifically
an
act
was
applied
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
chinese
people
from
doing
--
carrying
on
a
business
which
they
would
have
had
a
legal
right
to
do
when
others
were
permitted
to
do
it
or
whether
this
case
falls
within
the
kind
of
situation
that
occurred
during
the
curfew
regulations
during
the
war
in
china,
in
the
west
coast
where
the
japanese
who
have
specific
laws
were
passed
with
respect
to
the
japanese
and
those
were
upheld
by
this
court.
they
were
--
they
were
discriminatory
and
they
were
applicable
to
the
japanese
as
such
that
the
court
in
examining
the
factual
background
found
that
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
other
than
race
prejudice
for
the
application
of
those
--
of
those
rules.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
those
figures
are
not
given.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
are
given
annual
reports
of
the
--
i
think
that
i
can
get
them
from
an
annual
report
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
be
glad
to
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
--
i
want
to
call
--
to
make
one
analogy
that
i
think
will
make
my
point
clear.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
problems
facing
immigration
--
the
immigration
people,
is
investigations
for
health.
the
public
health
people
make
physical
examinations
in
accordance
with
instructions
in
order
to
determine
whether
applicants
for
entry
have
communicable
diseases.
now,
the
current
public
health
manual,
the
last
one
that
i
saw,
provides
with
respect
to
amoebic
dysentery
that
special
test
shall
be
made
of
all
persons
from
the
rural
areas
of
japan
and
greece.
now,
we
assume
that
an
applicant
for
entry
from
japan
agrees
with
--
were
tested
for
amoebic
dysentery
and
it
was
found
that
he
had
it.
i
submit
that
they
would
--
he
would
have
no
basis
for
claiming
that
this
special
test
and
it
is
a
special
test
made
as
to
these
people
was
the
result
of
race
prejudice
or
rather
it
is
a
result
of
a
determination
that
this
particular
test
is
necessary
with
respect
to
these
particular
applicants
because
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
their
application.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
no
--
there
are
no
regulations
which
deal
specifically
with
where
it
shall
be
used.
there
is
a
regulation
only
in
general
that
it
can
be
required
in
appropriate
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
all
there
is.
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
have
no
specific
information
that
it
was
ever
--
whether
it
was
ever
classified
or
not
but
the
distribution
which
appears,
the
last
paragraph
on
the
facing
page
provides
for
a
general
distribution,
not
a
general
distribution
but
for
a
distribution
to
places
outside
of
the
state
department
and
to
many
offices.
and
i
--
i
would
doubt
that
it
was
ever
classified.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
quite
right.
it
was
not
declassified.
mr.
john
f.
davis
certainly,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
statement
of
facts
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
we
have
referred
to
the
report
once
or
twice,
very
little
that
we've
relied
on
it
in
our
brief
as
they've
come
to
it
--
referred
to
report
at
one
--
at
one
place
and
i
think
it
was
obviously
referred
to
the
report
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
relying
on
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
most
of
it
--
most
of
it
comes
form
the
testimony
of
mr.
friedman
at
the
hearing
most
of
the
materials
in
the
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
have
to
check
particularly
all
the
statements
in
the
brief
and
in
order
to
answer
that
categorically.
i
think
--
my
belief
is
that
except
for
the
footnote
that
describes
the
report
in
one
place
where
there
is
a
reference
to
the
report
later
on
in
the
brief
where
it
is
identified.
i
think
that
the
information
comes
from
mr.
friedman's
testimony
rather
than
this
report
in
the
proceedings,
but
i
would
--
i
would
want
to
check
carefully
before
i
have
to
rely
on
that
statement.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
have
filed
that
so
that
you
may
the
information
as
to
the
background
material
or
so
that
you
may
take
judicial
notice
of
it
and
we
do
it
the
same
--
in
the
same
way
that
i
would
make
a
reference
to
it
if
it
were
readily
available
to
you
in
the
brief
for
you
to
find
it
in
the
library.
i
--
i
file
this
as
material
which
it
is
appropriate
for
you
to
take
judicial
notice
of,
and
for
your
convenience,
i'll
give
you
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
maybe
no
one
would
have
objected.
i
would
think
it
would
not
change
the
nature
of
the
document
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
just
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
--
this
report
itself
has
been
available
to
him
if
he
had
the
part
--
if
he
knew
about
it
and
if
he
asked
for
it
whether
the
information
--
all
of
the
information
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
but
i
mean
since
it
was
written.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
to
the
details,
i
do
not
know
how
much
they
had
available
to
them.
generally
speaking
in
this
--
and
i'm
sorry
to
speak
in
generalities
but
it's
all
that
i
can
do.
the
--
the
situation
described
in
this
report
is
the
same
situation
which
has
been
testified
to
in
district
courts
as
referred
to
in
several
district
courts
in
california.
the
--
the
general
situation
which
is
described
in
particular
in
this
report
has
been
received
wide
notoriety.
this
in
--
there
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
before
and
since.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
before
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
certainly
a
particular
documentation
of
--
of
a
situation
which
has
been
described
by
witnesses
in
the
courts
and
is
referred
to
in
their
opinions.
i
mean
the
district
courts
in
california
have
in
dealing
with
this
problem
have
described
the
same
thing.
perhaps
not
in
this
great
detail
but
have
described
the
same
thing
which
is
described
in
this
document
in
several
cases
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief.
