you
--
you
wouldn't
exclude
the
circumstance
that's
warranted,
the
court
could
find
on
the
base
of
the
record,
accountable
error
which
is
required.
i'm
not
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
you
do
about
it
but
i
just
want
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
as
to
what
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
all
i
meant.
i
(voice
overlap)
as
i've
said
i
don't
know
what
it's
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i'm
not
interested
at
the
moment
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
somebody
proves
to
me
that
there's
a
palpable
screeching
error
that
could
prevent
us
from
considering
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
it's
your
position
--
it's
the
government's
position
to
grant
the
blood
testing
of
chinese
is
not
a
discriminate
--
is
not
in
fact,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
law,
is
not
in
fact
a
discriminatory
classification
purposefully
directed
to
chinese
as
such,
like
the
yick
wo
case,
but
that
in
fact
the
incidence
of
the
use
of
effect
means
for
preeminent
on
the
chinese.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
may
i
ask
whether
your
brief
tells
how
many
people
are
qualified,
the
total
number
of
persons
who
sought
admission
to
this
country
on
the
claim
of
citizenship,
and
secondly,
what
proportion
of
that
total
were
people
of
chinese
variation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
going
to
the
last
two
or
three
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
the
author
of
that
article,
isn't
he
mr.
gim?
i
mean
the
one
who
coauthored
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
same
article,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
have
taken
out
of
mr.
davis'
time.
i
see
on
top
unclassified
and
i
assume
that
that
was
the
classification
of
--
it
had
at
the
time
it
was
--
on
december
9th,
1955,
you
just
said
something
that
disturbs
me
a
little
bit.
it
was
classified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
it
wasn't
unclassified
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
answer
if
i
take
it
explicitly
that
it
was
not
unclassified
for
purposes
abused
by
the
government
(voice

argued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
--
i
take
it
if
you
suggest
that
if
this
has
been
forwarded
to
congress
and
put
it
as
a
public
document,
the
question
wouldn't
arise,
is
that
right?
this
has
been
a
congressional
document.
i
suppose
you
could
turn
to
it.
i
don't
know
--
i'm
not
saying
for
what
the
purposes
or
what
it
proves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
had
any
doubt
that
if
it
were
a
congressional
document
if
you
looked
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
made
before
or
since
the
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
assume
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assume
that
a
fact
document
like
this
submitted
by
the
consul
general
at
hong
kong,
where
the
closing
paragraph
to
which
you've
called
attention
that
it
should
be
made
available
to
all
its
agencies
of
the
government
must
have
contained
something
and
not
be
merely
an
anchor
of
well
known
facts.
