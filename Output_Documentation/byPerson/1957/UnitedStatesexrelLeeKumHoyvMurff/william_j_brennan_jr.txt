high
degree
of
efficiency
in

particular
--
justice

had
birth
certificates?

they
were
not
instructions

--
directly
to

did
these
things,
apply
that
that's
only
for

it
make

any
of

made
specific

specifically,
right.

all
there

to
it.

mr.

may

last
question?
i
don't

answered
it.
would
you
suggest
that
the
justification
is
where
having
filed
that
in
the
court?
