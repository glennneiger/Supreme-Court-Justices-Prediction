mr.
benjamin
gim
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
and
involves
a
question
of
whether
the
immigration
service
made
lawfully
imposed
blood
test
on
chinese
alone
and
not
on
other
persons
in
cases
involving
claims
to
writ
their
citizenship
based
on
a
relationship
to
the
citizen
parent.
the
district
court
found
that
unlawful
racial
discrimination
had
been
practiced
against
the
petitioners
and
sustained
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
circuit
court,
judge
frank
dissenting,
reversed
this
decision
and
judgment.
the
petitioners,
two
boys
and
a
girl
being
then
at
the
ages
of
22,
13,
and
12,
arrived
in
the
united
states
at
ellis
island
in
june
of
1952
seeking
admission
as
citizens.
in
july
and
august
of
1952,
they
were
blood
tested
twice.
these
two
blood
tests
conflicted.
the
first
blood
test
excluded
all
three
petitioners
as
being
the
possible
children
of
the
citizen
parent.
the
second
blood
test
excluded
two
of
them.
on
the
bases
of
these
conflicting
blood
tests,
the
immigration
service
ordered
the
exclusion
of
all
three
of
the
petitioners
and
incarcerated
them
in
ellis
island
for
a
period
of
over
two
years.
in
a
review
of
these
proceedings
before
the
district
court,
judge
dimock
remanded
the
proceedings
to
the
immigration
service
for
a
reopen
hearing
to
allow
cross-examination
of
the
blood
test
technicians
and
to
develop
evidence
on
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination.
at
the
reopened
hearing,
the
immigration
service
refused
to
produce
an
official
to
testify
on
the
policy
of
the
service
with
regard
to
blood
test.
they
also
refused
to
produce
facts
and
figures
as
to
the
number
of
chinese
blood
tested
and
whites
if
any.
the
service
position
at
that
time
was
that
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
had
no
possible
bearing
on
the
decision
of
this
case.
notwithstanding,
the
refusal
of
the
immigration
service
to
produce
an
official
to
testify
on
the
policy
of
blood
test,
the
petitioners
went
ahead
and
proved
that
the
blood
test
program
commenced
with
the
sending
of
a
circular
at
the
direction
of
the
immigration
service
to
the
public
health
authorities.
this
circular
directed
blood
testing
of
chinese
persons.
it
did
not
specify
blood
test
for
any
other
nationality.
the
public
health
service
doctor
testified
that
pursuant
to
this
circular,
he
conducted
200
blood
tests
that
all
the
persons
tested
were
chinese
and
that
he
never
tested
a
white
person.
then
beginning
june
of
1953,
the
immigration
service
discontinued
using
the
public
health
service
to
conduct
these
tests
and
turn
the
matter
over
to
private
experts
such
as
dr.
leon
sussman.
now
dr.
sussman
testified
that
he
conducted
300
blood
tests
at
the
request
of
the
immigration
service
that
all
300
of
the
persons
tested
were
chinese
and
that
he
never
had
occasion
to
blood
test
a
non-chinese.
then
both
of
these
doctors
testified
at
the
hearing
that
these
two
blood
tests
were
invalid
and
inaccurate
and
insufficient
to
form
any
conclusions
as
to
paternity
or
non-paternity
in
this
case.
when
the
matter
went
back
to
a
district
court
--
mr.
benjamin
gim
the
two
doctors
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
gim
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
gim
testified
that
the
blood
tests
in
this
case
were
invalid
and
inaccurate
and
was
insufficient
to
base
any
conclusion
as
to
paternity
or
non-paternity.
mr.
benjamin
gim
this
was
a
private
expert
and
the
government
doctor.
mr.
benjamin
gim
dr.
leon
sussman
was
the
witness
for
the
petitioners.
mr.
benjamin
gim
well,
dr.
sussman
who
was
a
recognized
expert
and
who
was
used
by
the
immigration
service
said
that
there
were
enough
errors
in
the
report
themselves.
they
were
conflicting.
they
indicated
they
were
not
done
properly
and
therefore
he
would
place
no
reliance
on
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
gim
no,
sir.
they
were
done
by
a
transfusionist
in
the
public
health
service
and
the
doctor
who
supervised
these
blood
tests
himself
refused
to
standby
the
conclusions
of
these
tests.
when
the
matter
went
back
to
the
district
court,
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
the
writ.
the
government,
contending
that
blood
tests
were
not
imposed
on
chinese
alone
but
were
required
of
all
persons
who
did
not
have
birth
certificates
to
prove
their
identity
and
relationship.
now,
petitioners
answered
this
argument
by
citing
cases
of
chinese
who
had
birth
certificates
and
who
were
nevertheless
were
blood
tested.
judge
dimock
noted
that
these
cases
led
in
substance
to
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
immigration
authorities
for
the
second
time
for
the
specific
purpose
of
developing
evidence
on
the
issue
of
discrimination.
now,
this
time
at
the
second
reopen
hearing,
the
immigration
service
did
produce
a
witness.
now
this
witness
was
the
very
same
attorney
who
had
argued
the
prior
proceedings
before
judge
dimock.
this
witness
minimized
for
the
first
time
a
birth
certificate
matter
as
a
--
any
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
blood
test
would
be
needed.
he
stated
that
the
most
important
factor
in
determining
whether
a
blood
test
was
required
in
any
particular
case
was
whether
or
not
the
citizenship
claimant
was
born
in
an
area
which
was
accessible
to
an
investigation
by
the
american
consul.
he
said
that
if
the
american
consul
could
investigate
the
area
of
the
person's
claim
birth
and
ascertain
from
his
neighbors
and
relatives
and
local
government
officials
his
identity
and
relationship,
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
blood
test.
he
went
on
to
say
that
this
was
seldom
true
in
chinese
cases
that
all
the
chinese
applicants
were
born
in
the
remote
interiors
of
china
and
they
were
inaccessible
or
rather
the
areas
of
their
birth
were
inaccessible
to
a
consul
investigation.
however,
on
cross-examination,
this
witness,
although
he
conceded
that
the
consular
investigation
factor
was
a
long
standing
factor
in
determining
whether
blood
test
would
be
needed,
this
witness
conceded
that
in
all
the
prior
proceedings
before
judge
dimock,
he
had
never
once
mentioned
the
factor
of
a
consular
investigation
as
being
at
all
important
in
determining
whether
blood
tests
were
necessary.
at
that
time
in
those
proceedings
before
dimock
--
judge
dimock,
the
government
placed
sole
reliance
on
the
birth
certificate
as
the
most
important
factor
in
determining
whether
blood
test
would
be
needed.
now
on
further
cross-examination,
this
witness
who
appeared
as
the
immigration
service
expert
on
the
policy
insofar
as
on
discrimination,
this
witness
was
unable
to
cite
a
single
case
from
the
beginning
of
the
blood
test
where
a
white
person
had
ever
been
required
to
take
a
blood
test.
he
was
also
unable
to
cite
a
single
case
of
a
chinese
who
was
ever
exempted
from
the
blood
test.
then
these
witnesses
also
forced
to
admit
that
the
operation
instructions
of
the
immigration
service
did
at
one
time
contain
a
specific
direction
to
blood
test
chinese
but
this
witness
refused
to
produce
these
instructions
for
the
examination
of
consul.
this
witness
even
refused
to
summarize
the
language
of
these
operations
and
instructions.
mr.
benjamin
gim
this
witness
stated
that
the
government
instructions
were
confidential
and
to
review
it
would
be
prejudicial,
your
honor.
petitioners
went
ahead
to
prove
their
contention
that
chinese,
all
chinese,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
have
birth
certificates
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
were
born
in
areas
which
were
accessible
to
consular
investigation,
were
always
required
to
take
a
blood
test
and
other
persons
never
were.
the
form
of
proof
which
the
petitioners
introduced
consisted
of
several
cases
of
chinese
infants
who
were
born
in
the
british
territory
of
hong
kong.
none
of
these
infants
exceeded
the
age
of
six.
each
one
of
these
infants
had
never
been
to
china.
they
were
born
in
the
british
territory
of
hong
kong.
in
addition,
each
one
of
these
infants
had
a
british
government
birth
certificate.
his
parents
had
british
marriage
certificates.
in
one
of
these
cases,
the
american
consul
himself
had
issued
a
birth
certificate
for
the
child.
and
most
important,
there
is
a
large
american
consul
staff
in
hong
kong
and
these
applicants
were
thoroughly
investigated.
nevertheless,
each
one
of
these
children,
two
of
them
being
only
one-and-a-half
years
of
age
were
required
to
take
a
blood
test.
now,
on
the
face
of
this
record,
judge
dimock
found
that
the
policy
of
the
immigration
service
was
to
blood
test
all
chinese
and
no
whites
and
he
sustained
the
writ.
now,
the
circuit
court
with
judge
frank
dissenting
conceded
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
had
proved
that
there
were
500
cases
of
chinese
blood
testing.
that
there
were
no
cases
of
chinese
exemptions
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
white
person
blood
tested.
but
the
circuit
court
reasoned
that
the
petitioners
had
failed
to
prove
discrimination
because
they
have
failed
to
prove
that
the
immigration
service
officials
were
actuated
by
an
evil
motive
or
conscious
racial
prejudice.
this
court
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
sole
issue
of
racial
--
whether
or
not
racial
discrimination
was
practiced
in
this
case.
now,
petitioners
submit
that
the
factual
issue
tried
administratively
and
reviewed
by
the
district
court
was
whether
in
fact
all
chinese
were
blood
tested
or
whether
the
blood
test
extended
to
white
persons.
the
government
itself
put
this
issue
in
question
by
contending
that
blood
tests
were
not
restricted
to
chinese
but
were
applied
to
all
persons
without
birth
certificates.
then
the
government
later
changed
this
position
and
claimed
that
blood
tests
were
imposed
on
all
persons,
chinese
and
non-chinese
alike
who
were
born
in
areas
which
were
not
accessible
to
an
investigation
by
the
american
consul.
the
petitioners
submit
that
we
have
shown
that
these
two
excuses
advanced
by
the
government
for
blood
testing
chinese
only
are
really
inconsistent
and
tardy
afterthoughts.
we
think
further
that
the
citation
of
the
several
cases
of
blood
testing
of
hong
kong
chinese
infants
who
have
birth
certificates
and
who
are
accessible
to
a
consular
investigation
prove
that
no
chinese
were
ever
exempted
from
the
blood
test.
now
this
is
the
record
which
this
court
is
asked
to
review.
namely,
whether
or
not,
the
blood
tests
were
extended
to
white
persons
or
whether
or
not
the
blood
tests
were
confined
and
restricted
to
chinese.
on
this
posture
of
the
record,
it
is
submitted
that
judge
dimock's
finding
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
is
imminently
correct.
now,
after
the
government
lost
this
case
before
judge
dimock
and
after
judge
dimock
had
entered
a
judgement
for
the
petitioners,
the
government
for
the
first
time
moved
in
a
motion
for
reargument
claiming
on
a
basis
of
an
ex
parte
affidavit
that
beginning
in
1955,
60
white
persons
had
been
blood
tested.
now,
petitioners
submit
that
the
evidence
of
blood
testing
of
white
persons
in
1955,
the
petitioners
themselves
being
blood
tested
in
1952,
the
evidence
of
blood
testing
of
white
persons
in
1955
if
that
be
so
does
not
absolve
retroactively
a
discriminatory
practice
imposed
upon
chinese
in
1952.
moreover,
the
actual
citation
of
the
60
white
person
blood
tested
in
1955
actually
lend
support
to
the
proof
of
discrimination
in
this
case
because
if
there
were
reason
to
blood
test
60
white
persons
in
1955,
surely
there
were
reason
--
similar
reasons
existed
for
blood
testing
whites
in
1952,
in
1953
and
1954.
and
yet
in
all
these
years,
despite
the
reasons
for
demanding
a
blood
test,
the
immigration
service
could
not
show
any
examples
of
white
persons
blood
tested
in
those
years.
now,
the
government
argues
in
its
brief
that
well
beginning
1955,
especially
after
judge
dimock
had
condemned
racial
discrimination
in
blood
testing
chinese
beginning
1955,
we
reformed
and
there
is
no
reason
to
exclude
the
discriminatory
blood
test
in
this
case.
petitioners
submit
that
the
--
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
procedures
in
effect
in
1952
and
the
subsequent
repentance
by
the
government
in
blood
testing
white
persons
in
1955
does
not
retroactively
cure
any
discrimination
in
blood
testing
chinese
in
1952.
now,
it
may
be
true
that
if
--
as
claimed
by
the
government
that
they
have
reformed
and
now
the
blood
testing
--
and
if
blood
testing
is
now
administered
on
a
widespread
basis,
it
maybe
true
perhaps
that
any
chinese
hereafter
may
not
claim
discrimination
but
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
procedures
and
the
practices
of
1952
and
the
petitioners
were
entitled
to
be
determined
that
--
were
entitled
to
have
a
case
determined
on
the
procedures,
the
lawful
procedures
in
effect
of
1952.
now,
at
--
at
this
late
stage,
the
government
has
shifted
its
ground
again
and
has
advanced
another
justification.
now
this
justification
comes
in
the
form
of
a
consular
report
--
it's
apparently
unclassified
and
the
author
of
the
report
and
the
date
of
the
report
is
not
clear
but
this
report
purports
to
recite
a
high
incidence
of
fraud
among
chinese
persons
and
the
government
argues
that
from
this
report
which
is
replete
with
dubious
generalities
and
racial
insinuations
that
blood
testing
is
somewhat
justified
on
a
reasonable
basis.
petitioners
submit
that
this
document
was
never
submitted
in
the
administrative
hearings
or
before
judge
dimock.
it
is
submitted
in
the
first
in
this
court.
if
the
--
if
this
report
had
been
submitted,
petitioners
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
attack
the
conclusions
and
cross-examine
the
author
or
authors.
the
introduction
of
this
report
at
this
time
is
highly
unfair
and
prejudicial
and
the
petitioners
have
made
a
motion
to
strike
this
report
from
the
records.
now
petitioners
submit
that
the
only
effective
way
of
ensuring
the
constitutional
rights
--
kind
of
constitutional
rights
in
this
case
is
to
exclude
the
evidence
illegally
obtained
whereas
judge
learned
hand
once
observed
that
the
exclusion
of
improper
evidence
is
the
only
practical
way
the
courts
have
of
enforcing
constitutional
privilege.
now,
petitioners
submit
and
the
immigration
service
concedes
that
eliminating
the
disputed
and
inaccurate
blood
test,
all
the
other
evidences
in
this
case
clearly
establishes
the
relationship
and
furnishes
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
petitioner's
claim
to
citizenship.
mr.
benjamin
gim
the
government
does
not
concede
that
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
gim
yes,
sir.
i
may
have
a
few
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
gim
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
make
a
reply
to
the
question
i
believe
this
court
has
addressed
to
mr.
davis
on
whether
or
not
the
--
what
the
government
doctor's
position
was
on
the
accuracy
of
his
blood
test
and
i
believe
that
it's
found
on
page
216.
the
government
doctor
was
asked
on
the
one
segment
of
the
blood
test,
the
abo
segment
which
is
the
simplest
part
of
the
blood
test
and
the
doctor
was
asked
this
question.
would
you
be
--
do
you
feel
on
that
factor
alone
being
the
abo,
you
would
be
prepared
to
stand
by
your
conclusions
even
from
a
medical-legal
point
of
view?
and
the
doctor
replied,
“no,
i
don't
think
so”.
now
this
is
what
the
--
the
recognized
expert
said
on
the
blood
test.
dr.
sussman
on
page
178,
i
am
questioning
the
validity
or
accuracy
of
this
report
and
on
the
basis
of
such,
i
cannot
exclude
paternity.
i
am
not
saying
that
blood
testing
is
not
a
good
way
to
establish
on
paternity
but
on
these
particular
reports,
i
am
loathe
to
do
it
because
of
a
feeling
that
there
are
inaccuracies
which
prevent
me
from
establishing
these
as
good
evidence
of
paternity
or
non-paternity.
mr.
benjamin
gim
that
is
a
private
expert
used
by
the
government,
your
honor.

benjamin

leon
sussman.
mr.
benjamin
gim
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
gim
yes,
he's
the
coauthor
in
the
article.
mr.
benjamin
gim
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
gim
now,
the
court
also
said
on
page
47
that
these
--
that
the
trial
court
did,
the
pieces
of
blood
test
reports
are
clouded
in
inaccuracies
and
shrouded
mystery.
now,
mr.
davis
with
commendable
candor
admitted
that
at
the
time
the
petitioners
had
blood
test
in
this
case,
the
practice
was
to
ask
all
chinese
to
take
blood
test
and
that
these
blood
tests
were
not
extending
to
other
people.
i
only
regret
that
the
government
counsel
below
did
not
have
the
same
degree
of
candor.
now,
on
page
15,
this
is
the
pleadings
which
the
government
set
in
joint
issue.
the
petitioner
charged
that
blood
tests
were
administered
discriminatorily
against
chinese
only
and
this
is
what
the
government
said
in
its
return.
this
is
on
page
15.
while
it
is
true
that
such
blood
grouping
test
have
been
requested
principally
in
chinese
cases,
these
relaters
have
not
been
singled
out
for
unusual
treatment
since
such
test
are
uniformly
now
requested
of
all
applicants
for
admission
who
are
similarly
situated.
now
mr.
davis
cites
in
response
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
question
as
to
whether
any
chinese
were
exempted,
mr.
davis
said
that
there
were
50
chinese
exempted
and
i
think
what
mr.
davis
is
referring
to
is
page
99
which
is
the
ex
parte
government
affidavits
submitted
after
the
decision
was
in.
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
these
40
cases,
rather
50
--
the
latest
date
of
the
admission
is
june
16,
1952.
this
is
obviously
before
the
blood
test
program
commenced
and
obviously
that
40
chinese
were
admitted
before
the
blood
test
program
commenced
is
totally
irrelevant
and
is
no
showing
that
any
chinese
were
exempted.
i
think
more
significant,
however,
is
that
after
the
decision
was
in
and
after
the
government
took
the
trouble
to
dredge
up
the
statistics
which
they
had
maintained
all
along,
there
were
none.
they
have
failed
to
show
any
cases
after
june,
after
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
blood
tested.
they
have
failed
to
show
a
single
case
of
a
chinese
exemption.
i
think
that
is
more
significant.
now,
mr.
davis
also
mentioned
that
there's
a
great
difficulty
in
these
case
because
the
chinese
make
a
habit
of
going
back
and
be
getting
shown
abroad.
now,
on
our
--
in
our
reply
affidavit
on
page
8,
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
chinese
are
not
alone
in
this
practice
for
instance
in
--
from
the
immigration
annual
report
of
1954,
foreign-born
children
from
italy,
numbered
2,736
as
compared
to
only
336
from
china.
now,
a
passing
comment
on
this
hong
kong
report
that
i
--
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
court
may
not
take
judicial
notice
of
it
because
it's
not
an
official
published
report.
it
apparently
was
classified
at
one
time.
it
certainly
disputable,
it
was
never
made
accessible
to
the
public.
it
was
never
printed
by
the
government
printing
office.
it
is
not
entitled
to
the
same
status
as
an
official
report
of
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice.
mr.
benjamin
gim
well
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
benjamin
gim
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
from
whence
this
report
came.
just
one
closing
comment,
mr.
davis
says
that
the
issue
was
really
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
admitting
that
blood
testing,
for
a
specific
period
of
time,
was
limited
to
chinese.
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
reasonable
basis
was
never
an
issue
advanced
by
the
government,
that
the
government's
sole
reliance
in
the
trial
court
below
was
that
blood
tests
were
extended
to
other
people.
they
had
never
raised
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reasonable
justification.
now,
petitioners
submit
that
the
issue
of
reasonable
justification
is
not
before
this
court
and
especially
in
cases
involving
racial
discrimination,
the
classification
has
to
be
more
than
reasonable.
i
think
this
court
has
enunciated
that
racial
discrimination
is
odious
and
are
foreign
to
our
institutions
and
there
must
be
a
compelling
justification
and
exceptional
circumstances.
this,
we
submit,
the
government
has
failed
to
do.
thank
you.
