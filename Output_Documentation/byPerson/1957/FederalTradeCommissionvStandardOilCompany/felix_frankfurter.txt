justice

frankfurter
were
proceedings
against
these
alleged
competitors
of
standard
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
gather
--
so
i
gather
that
claim
of
standard
that
this
is
the
universal
practice
wasn't
accepted
by
everybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
the
hearings
that
were
instituted
against
so-called
competitors
were
to
abide
the
event
of
this
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
have
(inaudible)
it's
relevant
but
there's
the
commission
bringing
a
whole
industry
where
this
kind
of
a
practice
is
involved
or
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you
said
that
apart
from
other
considerations,
it
is
not
a
starting
point
in
this
case
that
at
least
some
of
its
competitors
do
the
same
thing
in
the
detroit
market.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
understand
that
proposition
but
i
want
to
know
the
question
of
fact.
is
this
to
be
assumed
that
it
is
not
to
be
accepted
that
then
the
defense
at
least
that
some
of
its
competitors
disproved.
that's
been
testified
originally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
standard
says
it
has
three
or
four
competitors,
may
do
the
same
thing.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no,
prop
--
i
understand
the
proposition,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
i
want
to
know
is,
assuming
it
did
make
a
difference,
are
we
to
assume
that
you're
denying
that
that's
so
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
only
question
of
law
is
--
the
question
before
us
whether,
even
i'm
assuming
that
their
defense
is
true
in
fact
is
immaterial
in
law,
is
that
the
center
of
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
be
both
defensive
and
responsive,
is
your
position,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
bring
them
in
all
--
under
the
same
umbrella
of
condemnation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
--
unless
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
bring
in
the
whole
market
in
the
industry
and
put
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
commission
found
that
in
order
for
enforcement
of
its
order
could
stand,
go
to
the
court
appeals
and
ask
for
an
enforcement
of
its
order?
i
though
it
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unlike
the
national
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
yes.
the
record
--
the
--
now
the
record
shows
that
in
volume
8.
it
shows
the
efforts
of
the
commission
to
certify
these
--
these
findings
to
the
seventh
circuit
so
as
to
get
a
speedy
and
expeditious
answer.
i
think
some
of
these
matters
are
dealt
with
in
the
materials
starting
at
page
5422
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
break
in
mr.
chaffetz?
wasn't
the
mandate
of
this
court
went
down?
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
certified
the
case
back
to
the
commission,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
happened
after
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
got
back
to
the
commission,
you
mentioned
15
months,
what
happened
during
those
15
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
due
to
the
post
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
there'd
been
no
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
what
were
the
findings
based
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
still
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
don't
understand.
we
sent
the
case
back
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
certain
determinations
and
there
were
proposed
findings
although
there'd
been
no
proceedings
with
reference
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
--
i
still
don't
understand
how
a
tribunal
can
issue
proposed
findings
without
determining
whether
there
should
be
proposed
findings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
filling
in
--
you
left
me
after
you
--
after
a
year
you
got
a
letter
and
surely
thereafter
the
proposed
findings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
take
the
rest
of
the
litigation
after
that
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
the
order
to
which
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
from
your
--
am
i
justified
in
inferring
from
what
you've
said
that
your
case
essentially
rests
in
supporting
the
decision
below
on
a
demonstration
of
the
record
that
these
were
responsive,
defensive
action,
do
i
understand
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
you
moved
in,
in
order
to
anticipate
their
moving
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
basis
of
granting
or
denying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
bear
under
good
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
were
recovered
by
then
is
i
don't
--
i'm
confused.
i
don't
understand
what
the
cost
defense
has
to
bear
--
if
you
call
that
related
to
the
good
faith?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
denied
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
asking
to
present
a
meeting
with
the
chief
justice
question,
but
before
you
sit
down,
i
wonder
if
it'd
be
fair
to
ask
you
this
question,
to
address
yourself
with
this.
what
do
you
regard
as
the
vital
finding
of
the
commission
against
you
and
what
reason
do
you
offer
by
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
have
deferred
to
those
findings?
before
you
sit
down,
if
you'll
deal
with
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
it
to
you
in
a
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
crucial
ground
on
which
the
commission
decided
against
you
and
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
refer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
did
(inaudible)
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
going
to
ask
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pollock
the
same
question.
do
i
infer
from
what
you
just
said
that
the
commission
held
in
effect
that
you
had
a
generalized
system
which
in
and
of
itself
was
violated
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
sit
here
and
make
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
sit
here
and
pursue
a
prophecy
whether
or
not
you
have
customers
anyhow.
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
try
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
to
him
is
a
question
of
fact,
isn't
it?
at
least
in
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
know,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
just
an
abstract
question
of
law,
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
deriving
it
from
a
finding
by
the
commission
as
to
what
that
system
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
told
me
i've
got
a
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
to
this
--
there's
one
more
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
commission
find
that
classifying
between
a
tank-car
and
a
tank
--
is
then
it
sells
from
illegal
classification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
of
the
cost-justification
is
a
--
is
--
is
a
classification
on
this
record
and
the
findings
of
the
commission
of
some
customers
of
standard
as
tank-car
customers
and
others
as
tank
--
what's
the
other
one?
wagon
customer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
classification
in
and
of
itself
as
spurious
and
therefore,
an
illegal
classification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
nobody
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
nobody
could
get
a
tank-car
price
anyhow.
is
that
it?
that's
all
--
and
that's
what
it
has
to
mean
to
mean
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
can
--
then
you
say
the
whole
of
ed
--
ned's
--
is
it
ed
or
ned's?
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
ned's
story
is
--
is
irrelevant.
it's
a
red
herring.
is
that
it?
the
whole
ned's
story
because
no
matter
how
true
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
he
couldn't
be
--
he
couldn't
be
classified
as
a
tank-car
seller.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
tank
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
can't
be
--
he
couldn't
be
classified.
nobody
could
be
classified
as
tank-car
seller.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
understand
what
you
--
what
--
what
you're
saying.
is
that
right?
nobody
could
be
classified
as
a
tank
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
(inaudible)
that
that
classification
is
in
inherent,
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
illegal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pollock,
may
i
ask
you?
and
the
slightest
notion
was
the
answer.
may
i
ask
you
whether
it
would
be
violated
with
robinson-patman,
to
differentiate
between
a
jobber,
doing
a
jobber's
business
with
--
in
all
its
ramifications
of
independent
jobber's
business,
and
five
or
six,
a
number
of
retailers
engaging
in
as
it
were
a
cooperative
scheme
merely
for
wholesale
value.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
have
function
of
discount
to
show
that
their
price
justification
is
wholly
--
which
would
not
exist
if
the
--
if
the
retailers
got
together
and
formed
a
purchasing
agency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
will.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
and
what
constitutes
a
bona
fide
jobber's
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
your
point
of
--
your
argument
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
before
or
after,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
mr.
chaffetz
indicated
that
this
case
really
centers
around
the
axis
of
the
case
of
ned's,
or
whatever
the
phrase
was.
now,
suppose
only
ned's
were
in
the
case,
would
the
record
show
that
seduction
was
--
the
process
of
seduction
had
began
against
ned's
and
this
is
a
response
to
that
attempted
seduction.would
that
be
within
or
without
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
forget
the
other
three.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
meant
is
on
--
on
your
statement,
would
the
whole
thing
fall
or
could
ned's
be
--
could
the
ned's
discrimination
so-called
survive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
--
would
mr.
chaffetz's
statement
both
accurate
and
well-balanced
in
the
picture
he
gave
us
of
how
they
held
out
against
ned's
in
a
kind
of
a
yield
instead
of
accurate
conveyance.
i
don't
mean
to
say
he
wouldn't
be
otherwise
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
purposely
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
inaccurate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
ned's
told
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
isn't
he
right
in
saying
what
you
and
i,
certainly
i
might
(inaudible)
what
was
it?
the
red
wing.
that
was
the
fleet-wing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
very
--
not
a
very
magnetic
name,
but
that's
--
i
never
heard
of
it.
but
if
he
thought
he
could
get
away
with
red
wing
sales
to
--
to
you
and
the
rest
of
the
people
who
drive
up
to
get
some
gas,
wouldn't
that
be
sufficient?
if
he
thought
that
--
that
he
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
replace
standard
with
red
wing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
system,
but
as
to
ned's.
