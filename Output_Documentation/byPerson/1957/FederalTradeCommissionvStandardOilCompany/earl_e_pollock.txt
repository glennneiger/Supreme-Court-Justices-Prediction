mr.
earl
e.
pollock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
by
a
coincidence,
this
case
also
involves
the
detroit-michigan
area
and
it
also
involves
the
problem
of
discriminatory
classification,
but
instead
of
dealing
with
taxes,
we're
concerned
here
with
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
the
question
presented
is
whether
regular
and
systematic
price
discrimination
which
is
otherwise
unlawful
and
which
is
merely
an
application
of
the
seller's
discriminatory
pricing
policy
can
be
justified
under
section
2
(b)
as
a
good
faith
meeting
a
competition.
section
2
was
amended
in
1936
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
as
amended,
section
2
(a)
prohibits
a
seller
in
interstate
commerce
from
discriminating
among
his
customers
by
granting
to
certain
customers
a
preferential
discount
where
the
effect
of
that
discount
maybe
to
injure
competition
and
where
the
amount
of
the
discount
cannot
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
cost
saving.
section
2
(b)
however,
provides
that
a
seller
may
rebut
a
prima
facie
case
against
him
by
showing
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
his
discriminatory
lower
price
was
made
in
good
faith
to
meet
the
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor.
we
are
concerned
here
exclusively
with
the
section
2
(b)
defense.
apart
form
that
defense,
the
illegality
of
standard
discount
is
now
established
by
prior
adjudications.
this
case
is
a
sequel
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1951
in
the
case
of
standard
oil
against
the
federal
trade
commission.
in
that
case,
this
court
construed
section
2
(b)
as
providing
a
complete
defense
if
proven
by
the
seller.
the
case
was
therefore
remanded
to
the
commission
for
findings
on
the
question
whether
standard
had
established
the
defense.
on
remand,
the
commission
resolved
that
question
in
the
negative.
it
held
that
standard
had
failed
to
satisfy
its
burden
of
proving
good
faith
under
section
2
(b).
i
intend
to
discuss
the
commission's
findings
on
this
issue
later
but
briefly
stated,
the
commission
found
that
all
of
the
discriminations
involved
here
were
not
made
in
response
to
competitive
offers.
and
further
more,
were
not
departures
from
a
nondiscriminatory
price
policy
but
instead
represented
only
the
continuous
and
regular
application
of
the
seller's
long
established
discriminatory
policy.
in
other
words,
the
commission
placed
this
decision
squarely
on
this
court's
decisions
in
the
staley
case
and
in
the
later
cement
case.
on
judicial
review,
the
commissioner's
decision
was
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
after
first
pointing
out
that
the
only
question
before
was
one
of
law
found
that
the
staley
and
cement
cases
were
inapplicable
here.
the
case
is
now
here
on
certiorari.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it's
most
important
to
understand
the
basic
economic
situation
which
gave
rise
to
this
commission
proceeding.
this
basic
economic
situation
is
reflected
in
appendix
b
of
our
reply
brief.
for
the
court's
convenience
we
have
reproduced
that
appendix
along
with
appendix
a
on
a
separate
sheet
and
i
believe
copies
have
been
distributed
on
the
bench.
as
you
will
see
from
this
diagram,
standard
sells
in
the
detroit
area
to
362
customers
who
resell
the
gasoline
at
retail
to
the
consuming
public.
all
362
of
these
customers
are
in
direct
competition
with
each
other
with
respect
to
the
sales
at
retail.
three
hundred
and
fifty-eight
of
these
customers
who
are
designated
in
the
box
on
the
left
side
of
the
diagram
as
the
non-jobber
dealers.
three
hundred
and
fifty-eight
of
these
customers
are
typical
individually
operated
filling
stations.
they
buy
their
price
--
they
buy
their
gasoline
from
standard
at
the
so-called
tank-wagon
price.
now,
this
tank-wagon
price
is
1.5
cents
or
approx
--
approximately
22%
higher
than
the
tank-car
price,
the
tank-car
price
which
standard
accords
to
its
other
four
customers
in
the
detroit
area.
i
might
also
add
that
these
358
non-jobber
dealers
sell
approximately
80%
of
all
standard
gasoline
in
the
detroit
area.
the
balance
is
sold
through
these
other
four
dealers.
now,
these
four
dealers
are
classified
by
standard
as
so-called
jobbers.
as
you
will
see
from
the
diagram,
three
of
these
four
jobbers
resell
their
gasoline
both
at
wholesale,
that
is,
to
other
retail
stations
and
also
at
retail
to
the
consuming
public.
the
fourth
jobber,
ned's,
sells
exclusively
at
retail.
now
as
we've
already
pointed
out,
these
four
jobbers
obtain
their
gasoline
on
all
of
their
purchases
and
not
merely
on
wholesale
sales,
on
all
of
their
purchases
obtain
this
gasoline
at
the
so-called
tank-car
price
which
is
considerably
lower
than
the
tank-wagon
price
which
is
charged
to
these
358
non-jobber
dealers.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
tank-car
price
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
typical
car-load
price
which
in
many
industries
and
from
many
companies
is
available
to
any
purchaser
who
wants
to
buy
more
than
a
less-than-carload
shipment
for
it
was
standard's
fixed
policy
that
it
would
never
grant
this
jobber
discount,
this
differential
of
1.5
cents
on
gasoline
sold
at
retail
unless
the
customer
had
an
annual
volume
of
at
least
one
to
two
million
gallons
a
year.
in
that
respect,
this
discount
is
very
similar
to
the
cumulative
volume
discount
involved
in
the
morton
salt
case
and
the
discount
i
might
add
which
the
entire
course
including
those
who
joined
the
separate
opinion
condemn.
now,
in
its
answer
to
the
commission's
complaint,
standard
was
quite
explicit
about
that
--
the
various
aspects
of
this
policy,
standard
called
it,
“its
general
policy
and
practice
of
bona
fide
selecting
and
classifying
gasoline
customers
as
wholesale
or
jobber
customers
as
distinguished
from
retail
resellers.”
standard
stated
in
its
answer
that
“such
system
and
practice
of
selection
and
classification
of
customers”
was
common
in
the
oil
industry,
it
was
recognized
by
many
other
suppliers
as
well
as
standard,
stated
that
this
jobber
discount
was
an
intrical
and
basically
essential
part
of
this
system
and
practice
and
that
was
the
language
of
the
answer,
i
might
add.
the
answer
further
stated
that
these
four
so-called
jobbers
regardless
of
how
they
sold,
whether
they
sell
exclusively
at
retail
or
partly
at
retail
were
entitled
to
this
jobber
discount
because
they
met
standard's
requirements
for
jobber
status.
that
is,
they
have
the
annual
volume
of
one
to
two
million
gallons
a
year.
they
also
have
obtained
storage
and
hauling
facilities
and
they
have
an
adequate
credit
rate.
i
might
add
throughout
the
lengthy
hearings
in
this
case,
standard
not
only
did
not
disavow
any
of
the
statements
and
its
answer,
but
on
the
contrary
introduced
voluminous
evidence
including
the
testimony
of
its
key
officials
which
was
designed
to
prove
each
and
everyone
of
the
statements.
we
have
set
out
in
both
our
main
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
the
copious
record
citations
where
these
--
this
testimony
maybe
found.
i
might
add
that
the
pertinent
paragraphs
of
this
answer
are
set
forth
as
an
appendix
to
our
main
brief.
now,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concern,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
at
all
what
this
method
is
called.
we
don't
care
whether
you
use
standard's
characterization
of
policy,
practice,
system,
or
whether
you
call
it
anything
else.
the
label
is
not
important.
what
is
important
here
we
believe
is
the
content
and
that
content
consist
of
the
following
elements
which
are
established
by
standard's
own
testimony
as
well
as
its
formal
pleadings
in
this
case.
i
want
to
add
that
the
government
in
this
case
is
not
relying
to
any
extent
on
government's
witnesses
or
government's
documents
in
the
record.we
are
relying
entirely
on
standard's
own
witnesses
and
standard's
own
pleadings
filed
during
the
proceeding.
the
first
element
is
that
standard
had
throughout
this
period
at
least
from
1928
on
when
citrin-kolb,
one
of
these
four
jobbers
was
granted
this
tank-car
price.
standard
has
always
had
two
prices,
the
tank-car
price
and
the
tank-wagon
price.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
standard's
witnesses
including
a
manager
of
its
gasoline
department
testified
that
this
practice
had
been
going
on
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
and
he
apparently
got
into
the
industry
around
1910.
in
other
words,
standard
had
two
prices,
the
tank-wagon
price
and
the
lower
tank-car
price.
two,
standard
had
fixed
criteria
for
determining
who
would
get
this
lowered
tank-car
price.
three,
these
requirements
were
as
i've
already
mentioned,
this
annual
volume
of
one
to
two
million
galloons
a
year,
the
maintenance
of
bulk
storage
and
hauling
facilities,
and
an
adequate
credit
rate.
four,
these
requirements
were
rigidly
followed.standard
would
give
up
a
customer
before
it
would
depart
from
anyone
of
these
requirements
or
before
it
would
increase
the
one-and-one-half-cent
differential.
appendix
a
just
above
this
diagram
consist
of
a
pricelist
which
standard
itself
into
this
--
into
this
proceeding,
and
as
you
will
see
from
the
time
of
the
robinson-patman
act
on,
the
third
column
shows
the
consistency
of
this
jobber
discount.
at
one
or
two
points,
the
differential
was
reduced
to
1.25
cent
or
1
cent
for
a
matter
of
weeks.
but
the
--
this
pricelist
itself
which
was
furnished
by
standard
shows
the
nature
of
this
dual
price
formula
throughout
the
period
in
question.
the
last
column
on
the
bottom
line
shows
that
the
average
that
the
retail
dealer
margin
enjoyed
by
the
tank-wagon
customers,
that
is
the
so-called
non-jobber
was
3.3
cents
per
gallon.
now,
with
this
additional
1.5
cent
it
meant
for
these
four
jobbers
on
all
of
their
retail
sales
had
a
margin
of
4.8
which
gave
them
even
--
after
deducting
the
cost
of
these
various
facilities
gave
them
at
least
a
30%
rate
of
profit
margin
than
the
non-jobber
customers.
and
five,
every
price
found
to
be
discriminatory
in
this
proceeding
was
in
exact
accord
with
this
formula.
now,
on
the
2
(b)
issue
the
commission
first
address
itself
to
the
evidence
offered
by
standard
as
to
specific
offers
received
by
these
four
jobbers
from
other
suppliers.
commission
found
that
during
the
period
in
question,
there
were
no
offers
whatsoever
to
two
of
the
four
jobbers,
stikeman
and
wayne
and
that
the
offers
to
ned's
and
citrin-kolb
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
grant
or
the
continuance
of
this
jobber
discount.
the
commission
then
turned
to
the
evidence
introduced
by
standard
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
it
on
this
to
the
effect
that
if
standard
stopped
granting
this
discriminatory
lower
price
and
the
prior
proceedings
have
established
the
illegality
of
this
discount
apart
from
2
(b)
that
if
standard
stopped
granting
this
discriminatory
lower
price
that
other
companies
who
are
following
the
same
practice,
this
practice
which
standard
witnesses
characterize
as
a
universal
practice
in
the
industry
not
only
in
detroit
but
through
out
the
country,
that
if
they
stopped
doing
that
that
these
other
suppliers
who
are
following
the
same
practice
and
who
would
not
discontinue
their
adherence
to
this
policy
would
obtain
these
four
jobber
customers
because
their
requirements
for
a
jobber
status
were
identical
to
standard's
policy.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
at
the
time
of
the
complaint
against
standard
was
issued
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
commission
also
issued
complaints
against
three
principle
competitors
in
the
detroit
area,
gulf,
texas,
and
shell.
by
agreement
among
counsel,
it
was
understood
that
this
case
would
be
the
test
case
and
that
proceedings
on
those
complaints
would
be
deferred
until
this
case
had
been
adjudicated.
those
complaints
never
went
before
a
hearing
examiner.
earlier
this
year,
they
were
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
they
had
never
gone
to
trial
and
that
--
it
would
be
impossible
to
hold
hearings
now
on
the
period
in
question.
but
shortly
thereafter,
the
commission
initiated
a
new
investigation
against
these
three
companies
based
on
their
present
continuance
of
the
same
practice.
there's
no
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
it's
a
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it's
quite
clear
that
it's
not
a
universal
practice.
it's
followed
by
a
large
segment
of
the
gasoline
industry.
that's
shown
by
this
record.
but
standard's
two
principal
competitors
in
the
detroit
area,
socony-vacuum
and
sun
did
not
follow
it,
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
use
this
practice.
they
sold
exclusively
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
at
the
tank-wagon
price.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
--
that's
right.
of
course,
there
might
still
be
some
problem
as
to
cost
justification
which
might
require
some
--
some
hearings
on
a
limited
basis.
but
this
case
was
recognized
by
everyone
as
the
basic
test
case.
of
course
it's
taken
a
good
deal
of
time
for
this
case
to
reach
here.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it's
very
common
to
issue
a
number
of
complaints
at
one
time
in
a
given
market.
it's
also
common
that
since
the
robinson-patman
act
which
amended
the
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
is
directed
against
the
action
of
a
single
seller
that
for
the
sake
of
handling
the
case
without
getting
bogged
down
in
a
record
longer
than
the
5500
pages
in
this
case
that
they
will
take
one
of
this
--
one
of
the
sellers
involved
may
perhaps
one
of
the
principal
violators
or
perhaps
the
market
leader
as
in
this
case.
standard
sells
more
gasoline
in
detroit
than
anyone
else.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
but
the
commission
takes
the
position
that
the
mere
fact
that
these
other
companies
are
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
they
have
about
18
or
19
that
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
about
18
or
19
according
to
their
count.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
no.
we're
not
denying
that
so.
as
a
matter
fact
if
this
--
if
the
commission's
order
is
reinstated
here,
the
commission
would
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
other
companies
would
bring
their
price
policies
into
line
and
failing
that
they
would
initiate
proceedings.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i'd
say
the
--
an
investigation
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no.
the
commission
also
found
that
--
as
i
say
that
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
standard
hadn't
--
had
never
accorded
these
prices
in
response
to
specific
offers
from
suppliers.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
and
went
further
and
said
that
even
apart
from
specific
offers,
it's
maybe
doubted
whether
it's
even
necessary
to
go
ahead
on
this
because
there
are
some
room
for
argument
that
the
only
time
the
2
(b)
defense
comes
into
play
is
when
there
is
a
specific
offer.
but
the
commission
went
ahead
and
said,
"wholly
apart
from
the
question
of
specific
offers.
the
mere
facts
that
these
four
jobbers
might
be
able
to
get
the
same
kind
of
deal
from
other
companies
following
the
same
discriminatory
pricing
--
practice
does
not
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
satisfy
the
good
faith
of
the
requirement
here."
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
as
the
commission
put
it,
these
prices
were
not
the
result
of
departures
from
a
nondiscriminatory
price
scale
which
were
made
to
meet
the
equally
low
prices
of
the
competitors.
they
represented
only
the
continued
application
of
standard's
discriminatory
policy.
all
of
the
discriminations
involved
here
were
in
accordance
with
and
pursuant
to
standard's
discriminatory
policy.
the
trouble
here,
in
other
words
is
not
consists
in
a
deviation
from
standard's
normal
and
customary
as
the
long
established
price
scale.
but
the
discriminations
here
consist
of
the
repeated
continuos
in
fact
for
decades,
application
of
this
policy
or
system
which
is
itself
discriminatory.
in
other
words,
the
policy
have
a
congenital
defect
and
the
commission
took
the
position
that
the
2
(b)
defense
under
this
court's
decision
in
staley
and
cement
and
only
this
last
term,
in
national
lead,
of
course
national
lead
has
not
been
decided
but
national
lead
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
the
2
(b)
defense
presupposes
a
nondiscriminatory
price
scale
and
then
reductions
from
this
price
scale
in
response
to
individual
competitive
situations.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
so.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
but
in
this
case,
the
question
of
whether
the
--
these
so-called
lower
prices
were
responsive
is
really
immaterial
under
the
commission's
findings
although
that
might
have
been
an
independent
ground
for
rejecting
the
defense
but
the
commission
believes
and
it
reads
this
court's
decision
saying,
"that
a
seller
cannot
be
said
to
be
in
good
faith
under
2
(b)
until
he
first
establishes
a
nondiscriminatory
price
scale."
a
seller
in
other
words
can't
merely
continue
going
along
with
the
discriminatory
pricing
policy
and
rely
on
the
fact
that
everybody
else
in
the
industry
or
a
large
segment
of
the
industry
is
following
the
same
discriminatory
policy.
the
commission
pointed
out
what
would
be
the
cons
--
inevitable
consequence
of
adopting
that
kind
of
argument.
if
standard
can
defend
its
continuation
of
these
discriminations
year
after
year
after
year,
simply
on
the
ground
that
other
suppliers
are
following
the
same
practice,
then
by
the
same
token,
standard's
competitors
when
their
discriminatory
price
scale
is
challenged
and
rely
on
the
fact
that
standard
is
following
the
same
policy.
the
result
would
be
to
virtually
nullify
the
robinson-patman
act
in
any
industry
where
price
discrimination
is
really
serious.
that
is
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
you
mean
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
of
course
it
would
have
been
--
i
think
--
i
think
that's
right
that
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
if
that
would
have
been
feasible,
of
course
i
think
that
it's
a
--
the
commission
had
undertaken
to
do
that,
this
case
which
standard
already
says
is
long
and
much
over
aged.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
started
in
1940.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
all.
it's
still
in
its
adolescence
mr.
justice
black.
[laughter]
but
in
that
respect,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
case
is
still
very
timely.
the
--
the
record
relates
to
discriminations
during
the
1936
and
1940
period.
but
if
standard
is
right
in
its
contentions,
it
has
a
right
to
continue
doing
this
today
and
indefinitely.
and
the
record
has
already
been
made
up.
there's
nothing
stale
about
it
with
respect
to
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
it's
most
unfortunate
that
a
--
such
a
proceeding
takes
that
long.
of
course
as
i
pointed
it
out
before
the
case
was
here
before
in
1950.
it
came
up
here
first
1949,
was
argued
twice
on
a
question
of
whether
2
(b)
constitutes
complete
defense.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
--
i
couldn't
provide
any
explanation
except
for
the
fact
that
the
case
bitterly
fought
by
the
parties
that
every
stage.
the
--
the
commission
tried
to
expedite
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
commission
tried
to
expedite
the
--
this
case
by
certifying
its
decision
on
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals.standard
immediately
attacked
that
proceeding
and
said
that
a
--
that
was
not
the
proper
way
and
persuaded
the
court
of
appeals
after
much
--
much
argument
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
commission.
so,
that
even
though
the
commission
finally
made
these
findings
in
1953,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
decision
until
1956.
certiorari
was
granted
last
year
and
here
we
are
now.
i
think
it's
unfortunate.
but
what's
this
--
the
principle
which
is
involved
here
is
established.
i
think
we
have
every
right
to
expect
that
other
suppliers
as
well
as
standard
will
abide
by
what
is
declared
to
be
the
law.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
if
that's
so,
i'm
--
i'm
completely
unaware
of
it,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
could
indicate
that
and
i'm
not
aware
of
it
otherwise.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
seventeen.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
wouldn't
want
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
what
--
i
think
the
time
table
is
approximately
this
that
the
case
was
decided
here
in
1951.
the
commission
issued
its
proposed
findings
on
remand
in
1952,
there
were
then
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes.
and
a
year
later
the
commission
issued
its
proposed
findings
there
was
then
argument
and
briefs
on
those
proposed
findings
and
those
findings
were
finally
promulgated
i
think
in
january
1953.
and
the
case
was
not
heard
in
the
court
of
appeals
until
1950
--
i
believe
--
i
think
1955,
1956.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that
partly
it
was
because
of
the
--
of
the
squabble
which
developed
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
could
expedite
things
by
sending
the
--
its
new
findings
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals.
standard
fought
that
vigorously.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
no.
standard
insisted
that
the
only
way
that
it
could
--
that
this
case,
at
least
findings
could
be
reviewed
is
by
letting
it
file
its
own
petition
for
review.
and
there
is
no
--
there's
no
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there
is
no
--
i
want
to
find
out
there
is
no
time
limitation
for
filing
a
petition
for
review
on
the
commission's
findings
under
this
act.
so
the
commission
had
no
alternative
but
to
wait
until
the
standard
undertook
to
bring
this
case
up
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
and
i
confirm
to
this
that
the
commission
cannot
appeal
until
the
--
there's
been
a
refusal
or
neglect
to
obey.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there
has
to
be
an
enforcement
proceeding
and
that
--
that
court
--
this
court
dealt
with
that
problem
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
do
want
to
repeat
that
one
of
the
basic
assumptions
that
the
robinson-patman
act
is
--
operates
on
is
that
it
is
not
--
will
not
be
necessary
to
bring
a
separate
proceeding
like
this
every
time
everyone
engages
in
a
discriminatory
policy.
once
--
it
is
established
that
the
2
(b)
defense
is
not
available
here.
i
think
we
would
have
a
right
to
expect
that
suppliers
not
only
in
detroit
but
elsewhere
that
follow
the
identical
pricing
policy
would
bring
their
policies
in
the
line.
now,
failing
that
if
they
refused
to
do
so
then
of
course
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
commission
to
bring
supplemental
proceedings,
but
this
is
a
test
case
it
that
respect
and
an
important.
now,
the
court
below
set
aside
the
commission's
decision.
it
held
that
staley
and
cement
were
inapplicable.
as
we
understand
its
opinion
which
it
said
is
squarely
on
a
legal
question
and
was
devoted
only
to
the
question
of
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
legal
reasoning,
the
court
held
that
stanley
and
cement
involved
only
the
meeting
of
illegal
prices
of
competitors.
now
this
analysis,
stanley
and
cement,
simply
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
express
holdings
of
--
of
those
decisions.
apparently,
standard
recognizes
that
because
standard
has
in
effect
confessed
error
on
the
court
below.
nowhere
in
its
75
page
brief,
doesn't
attempt
to
uphold
that
analysis
or
that
holding
of
the
court
below.
standard
now
agrees
that
stanley
and
cement
are
controlling
precedence.
standard
now
agrees
that
its
discriminations
in
order
to
be
justifiable
must
have
occurred
in
individual
transactions,
individual
competitive
situations.
it
attempts
to
meet
that
test
however
by
reliance
on
a
statement
in
the
latter
part
of
the
court's
opinion
which
is
as
follows.
“standard
sold
invariably
at
its
uniform
tank-wagon
price
except
when
at
different
times
it
reduced
its
price
to
meet
competitive
offers
in
order
to
retain
a
customer.”
that's
at
page
5501
of
the
record.
standard
repeats
that
again
and
again
throughout
its
brief.
it
says
that
thus,
the
court
below
decided
this
case
on
factual
grounds,
on
factual
grounds.
and
according
to
standard's
analysis
of
the
decision
below,
the
court
below
actually
held
that
standard
simply
met
specific
offers
and
departed
from
a
uniform
tank-wagon
price
in
individual
competitive
situations.
now
this
assertion,
this
--
or
dictum
whatever
it
might
be
classified
as
in
the
opinion
below
is
clearly
erroneous
and
i
think
we
can
show
that
it
is
quite
readily
in
just
a
moment.
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
if
standard
is
correct
in
its
analysis
of
the
decision
below,
that
is
that
the
court
place
its
decision
on
factual
grounds
we
would
have
a
truly
extraordinary
situation
in
which
a
court
of
appeals
says,
“for
purpose
of
determining
our
scope
of
review
we
say
that
this
is
a
question
of
law.”
and
then
having
gotten
its
foot
in
the
door
the
court
then
proceeds
to
decide
the
case
on
factual
grounds.
if
that
or
precisely
what
happened,
what
happened
here
and
we
don't
think
so
but
standard
argues
that
it
--
that
is
what
happened.
and
i
think
that
any
such
actions
in
itself
which
surely
require
correction
by
this
court
because
it
was
apparent
from
the
discussion
of
the
court
below
as
to
whether
it
was
a
law
of
fact
question
that
was
trying
to
overcome
the
limitations
imposed
by
this
court
on
the
review
of
factual
findings
of
the
commission.
but
let's
assume
that
that's
what
the
court
did.
the
court
in
making
this
statement
that
standard
sold
invariably
at
its
uniform
tank-wagon
price
except
on
different
times
it
reduced
its
price
to
meet
competitive
offers
in
order
to
retain
a
customer
obviously
refers
to
the
initial
grant
of
the
tank-car
price
to
these
four
customers.
now
i'd
like
to
make
a
categorical
statement
here
which
can
clarify
the
--
i
hope,
the
basis
or
lack
of
basis
for
this
assertion.
as
to
three
of
these
four
jobbers,
citrin-kolb,
stikeman
and
wayne,
there
not
only
is
not
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
--
this
assertion
of
the
court
below,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
that
assertion.
now,
if
that
categorical
statement
is
wrong
then
i
think
counsel
for
standard
should
be
--
since
they
placed
their
case
squarely
on
that
one
sentence
should
come
forward
and
tell
us
with
appropriate
record
citations
just
who
these
suppliers
were
who
made
these
other
offers
and
what
the
prices
were
which
they
offered.
obviously,
this
must
be
on
the
record
if
their
--
if
this
assertion
of
the
court
below
can
be
supported.
now
we
have
at
least
a
number
three
or
four
other
reasons
why
this
statement
is
erroneous
and
we
have
discussed
those
in
our
reply
brief.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
before
the
government
is
under
any
obligation
to
undertake
or
review
of
the
facts
of
this
case
the
standard
should
at
least
come
forward
and
show
us
some
evidence
as
to
the
circumstances
involving
the
grant
of
jobber
status
to
three
of
these
four
jobbers
which
are
involved
here.
i
would
also
add
that
i
have
some
doubt
as
to
whether
standard
really
is
in
a
position
to
argue
now
that
the
decision
below
really
turned
on
factual
grounds.
for
in
its
brief
below
which
is
on
file
with
the
court,
standard
said
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
standard
asked
for
reversal
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
own
findings
as
a
matter
of
law.
yet,
now
standard
tells
us
that
the
decision
below
is
simply
one
of
fact
and
that
this
court
shouldn't
wade
through
the
voluminous
record
in
order
to
overrule
the
decision
below.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
real
difficulties
in
clarifying
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
ease
with
which
standard
has
repeatedly
shifted
its
position
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding.
in
the
court
below,
for
example,
standard
did
not
attack
the
finding,
the
factual
findings
of
the
commission.
the
standard
said
in
its
brief,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
commission
may
reject
petitioner's
meeting
competition
defense
in
defiance
of
these
judicial
directors
and
in
spite
of
its
own
factual
findings
that
established
petitioner's
good
faith
as
a
matter
of
law.
again,
on
page
6
of
their
brief,
and
these
briefs
had
been
filed
with
the
court,
standard
says,
“the
controlling
facts
are
not
in
dispute.”
standard
thereupon
asked
for
reversal
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
own
findings.
the
court
below
agreed
with
standards
as
to
what
the
question
was
that
was
presented.
the
court
below
said,
“we
are
confronted
here
only
with
a
question
of
law,
not
a
question
of
fact.”
we
are
not
limited,”
the
court
said,
"by
the
admonitions
in
this
court
--
in
this
court's
decisions
in
staley
and
other
decisions
about
interfering
unduly
with
the
--
the
administrator
process.”
the
court
said,
“we're
dealing
here
only
with
the
question
of
law
and
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
legal
decision
depends
solely
on
the
correctness
of
its
legal
reason.”
that
is
what
happened
in
the
court
below.
now,
it
is
true
that
toward
the
end
of
its
opinion,
the
court,
and
what
i
think
was
only
a
matter
of
obiter
dictum
said
--
it
did
--
said
--
make
a
statement
on
what
--
what
standard
now
says
is
the
gist
of
the
entire
decision
below
and
on
the
basis
of
that
statement,
it
now
comes
to
this
court
and
for
the
first
time,
says
that
this
court
should
defer
to
the
decision
below
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
would
be
improper
to
undertake
the
de
novo
appraisal
of
the
record
in
the
same
way
that
the
court
below
did.
we
submit
that
the
only
question
is
one
of
law
and
that
standard
at
this
late
date
cannot
undertake
to
attack
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
commission,
even
apart
from
the
question
of
whether,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
been
obliged
to
defer
to
those
factual
findings.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
question
of
law
that
i
believe
is
presented
here
is,
of
course,
generally
whether
standard
has
proved,
carried
its
burden
of
proving
it's
good
faith,
but
more
specifically
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
not
according
to
the
court
below.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
court
below
said
that
it
was
a
question
of
law.
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it's
--
naturally,
you
can't
get
away
from
the
facts
because
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
law
in
fact
aren't
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
we
always
have
to
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
factual
basis
for
--
for
the
question
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
of
law.
that's
right.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
seller
--
which
has
a
discriminatory
price
policy,
whether
or
not
that
seller
can
continue
to
discriminate,
pursuant
to
and
accordance
with
that
policy
and
still
be
said
to
be
in
good
faith.
the
commission's
view
on
the
other
hand
is
that
a
seller
to
be
in
good
faith
must
first
of
all
undertake
to
establish
a
nondiscriminatory
price
scale.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
standard
has
completely
abandoned
the
argument
which
it
made
below.
the
argument
which
it
said
was
the
principal
argument
below.
it
now
has
confessed
error
on
the
court
below
and
it
ceases
on
this
one
sense.
in
the
opinion
below,
it
says
that
this
constitutes
the
crux
of
the
decision
below
and
i'd
like
to
examine
that
sentence.
well,
i
think
i
can
show
quite
readily,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
it
is
completely
unsupported
by
the
record.
this
sentence
was
this.
it
appear
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
it's
best
set
forth
in
its
--
by
its
--
key
officials
during
--
during
the
hearing
and
also
in
its
answer.
let
me
illustrate
if
i
can.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
surely.
the
commission
in
paragraph
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
in
paragraph
14
of
its
findings.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
all
right,
let's
start
with
paragraph
13
at
page
5383.
commissioner
pointed
out
that
respondent's
method
of
pricing
its
gasoline
in
the
detroit
area
is
to
sell
its
customers
generally
at
what
is
designated
in
the
oil
industry
as
the
tank-wagon
price
and
to
sell
to
a
much
more
limited
--
limited
number
of
purchasers
at
a
tank-car
price.
the
latter
being
one
and
a
half
cents
per
gallon
lower
than
the
former.
the
tank-car
price
is
also
generally
referred
to
as
the
jobber
price
although
the
granting
of
such
price
is
not
based
upon
any
consideration
of
a
method
of
resale
by
the
purchaser.
for
example,
ned's
is
classified
as
a
jobber,
even
though
it
had
no
wholesale
sale
and
so
on.
it
merely
constituted
a
chain
of
service
stations,
but
standard
said,
"well,
you
are
a
jobber
and
we
will
give
you
a
jobber
price."
the
commission
goes
on
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
exclusively
through
his
own
chain
and
that
this
was
--
this
was
called
a
jobber
and
--
and
this
court's
ruberoid
decision,
the
court
made
perfectly
clear
that
sellers
can't
use
ambiguous
labels
to
cover
up
preferential
discount.
it's
the
content
that
matters.
it's
the
competition
that
mattered,
not
the
fact
of
what
you
call
it.
otherwise
the
robinson-patman
act
would
be
a
dead
letter
by
just
assigning
a
--
a
high-sounding
label
to
a
particular
group
of
customers
that
you
want
to
favor.
now,
going
on
here,
the
respondent
standard
for
granting
the
tank-car
price
is
that
a
purchaser
make
annual
purchases
of
from
one
to
two
million
gallons
of
gasoline,
have
storage
facilities
and
have
a
credit
rating
satisfactory
to
assure
payment.
now,
let
me
now
illustrate
how
this
works.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
surely
mr.
justice.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
no.
it
--
it
depends
entirely,
first
of
all,
whether
there
is
proof
of
competitive
injury.
that's
out
of
the
case.
that's
established
now.
and
also,
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
discount
can
be
cost-justified,
the
overwhelming
evidence
here.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
wagon.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh,
yes.
the
commission
found
that
that
was
a
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
was
an
arbitrary
classification.
that
was
arbitrary
classification.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
oh
but
--
let
me
rephrase
that,
mr.
justice.
commission
filed
was
an
arbitrary
classification
because
these
jobbers
do
not
sell
exclusively
at
wholesale.
in
fact,
an
outlet
like
ned's
sold
exclusively
at
retail,
said
it's
an
arbitrary
classification
to
say,
“we
will
call
you
a
jobber
even
though
you
have
a
service
station
right
across
the
street
from
jim
smith,”
who
sells
under
a
million
gallons
a
year.
we
--
we
charge
him
the
tank-wagon
price
because
he
doesn't
have
a
big
enough
volume.
but
this
station
across
the
way,
that's
one
of
--
that's
part
of
a
chain
and
we
give
them
the
tank-car
price
because
they
sell
a
lot
of
gasoline
for
us.
in
this
respect,
it's
just
like
cumulative
discount
which
was
involved
in
the
morton
salt
case
and
which
this
court
unanimously
condemned,
even
in
the
separate
opinion
of
mr.
justice
jackson.
it's
that
kind
of
classification,
which
is
invalid,
apart
--
as
long
--
unless
these
other
defenses
can
be
made
out.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
ned's.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
as
a
tank-wagon.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
he
couldn't
be
classified
as
a
tank-wagon
customer.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
either
that
he
was
classified
as
a
tank-car
customer,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
four
customers
were.
four
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
--
that's
the
whole
basis
of
this
case.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
now,
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
illustrate
this,
but
i
kind
of
think
it
will
make
it
a
good
deal,
more
concrete
than
the
case
has
been
so
far.
unfortunately,
it's
been
discussed
too
much
so
on
an
abstract
level.
let's
assume
that
we
have
here
in
detroit
a
busy
intersection
at
the
corner
of
maine
and
broad
street.
at
one
corner
is
the
station
owned
by
jim
smith.
he
--
he
owns
the
station
and
he
operates
himself.
he
sells
200,000
gallons
of
gas
a
year.
down
the
block
is
another
standard
station.
this
station
is
part
of
a
chain,
which
also
--
which
is
owned
by
a
so-called
jobber.
this
jobber
gets
this
price
not
because
of
an
--
of
a
competitive
offer
made
by
another
company
but
rather
because
he
has
sufficient
gallonage.
he
has
--
his
buys
at
least
a
million
gallons
a
year
from
standard
oil.
now,
jim
smith,
on
the
other
hand,
pays
the
tank-wagon
price
as
distinguished
from
the
tank-car.
now,
he
has
a
margin
of
three
and
three-tenths
cent
on
each
gallon
of
gas.
his
competitor
right
down
the
block
is
selling
the
same
product,
has
a
margin
of
4.8.
he
goes
to
standard.
he
says,
“look,
i
can't
compete
with
them
if
--
if
they
--
when
they
cut
two
cents
off
their
price,
i
can't
make
my
overhead
because
they
have
a
--
a
much
bigger
margin
to
play
with.”
he
says,
“look,
i'll
go
and
buy
bulk
storage
facilities.
it's
--
they're
readily
available.
will
you
then
give
me
this
tank-car
price?”
and
standard
says,
“no.
we
will
not
because
you
do
not
have
--
do
not
buy
one,
two
million
gallons
a
year.”
suppose
then
that
jim
smith
says
--
goes
back
a
second
time
and
he
says,
“now
look,
it
doesn't
cost
you
anymore
money
to
--
to
send
your
transport
truck
to
my
bulk
plant
than
it
does
to
my
competitor's
bulk
plant.
yet
you
give
him
a
30%
greater
margin
on
his
--
on
his
sales
on
his
retail
sales
in
direct
competition
with
me.
jim
smith
says,
“well,
how
did
the
five
other
filling
station
operators,
just
like
myself,
non-jobbers
so-called.
how
did
the
--
if
we
all
get
together
and
buy
on
a
group
basis
because
altogether,
we
buy
from
you
at
least
a
million
gallons
a
year.
again,
they
go
to
standard
and
standard
says,
“sorry,
it
is
our
definite
policy
and
practice
that
we
will
not
permit
this
kind
of
discount
to
being
accorded
to
anyone
of
our
customers
except
the
customer
that
singly
buys
a
million
gallons
a
year.
and
that
is
what
we're
talking
about
here.
it's
that
time
of
continuous
regular
discrimination,
not
only
for
years,
but
for
decades.
we've
talked
on
thursday
about
the
age
of
this
proceeding
as
true
enough
that
17
years
old,
five
of
that
was
--
was
involved
in
judicial
review
proceedings,
even
the
--
when
the
case
was
here
before.
two
and
a
half
years
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
two
years
in
this
court
went
back.standard,
i
think,
is
itself
responsible
for
what
--
delay
of
two
years
for
failing
to
immediately
file
a
petition
for
review.
but
wholly
apart
from
that,
if
anyone
has
any
just
claim
about
the
delay
involved
in
this
proceeding,
it's
--
it
is
this
group
of
358
filling
station
operators
who
have
been
suffering
the
kind
of
injury
which
is
involved
here
for
longer
than
17
years
and
they
will
continue
to
suffer
it
for
another
17
years
or
even
longer
unless
the
commission's
order
is
reinstated.
apart
from
the
2
(b)
defense,
this
is
a
classic
--
a
classic
robinson-patman
act
case.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
the
commission
in
there
is
--
certainly
in
this
case,
and
in
no
other
case
that
we're
aware
of
has
ever
said
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
functional
discount
to
a
wholesaler.
in
this
case,
these
jobbers
can
continue
to
have
the
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
well,
if
i
understand
your
--
your
question
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
your
honor
as
far
as
the
functional
discount
is
concerned,
the
question
of
cost
savings
doesn't
present
itself.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
there's
--
then
the
commission's
order
in
this
case
does
not
prevent
the
standard
from
continuing
in
this
jobber
differential
on
bona
fide
jobber
sales.
for
example,
citrin
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
it
depends
on
the
manner
of
use.
if,
for
example,
ned's
sold
exclusively
at
retail,
it
can't
be
called
a
jobber
or
a
wholesaler
except
by
a
flight
of
fancy.
as
far
as
this
court's
ruberoid
decision
is
concerned,
that
company
is
a
retailer.
it's
in
direct
competition
with
all
of
these
so-called
non-jobbers
and
as
far
as
it
is
concerned,
it
is
entitled
to
no
greater
differential
than
a
differential
whether
it
makes
due
allowance
or
cost
savings.
for
example,
let's
--
let's
see
just
what
standard
could
have
done
in
this
case
to
have
been
in
good
faith,
when
the
robinson-patman
act
was
passed.
suppose
standard
thereupon
said
to
its
four
jobber
customers,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
none
of
these
four
jobbers
was
ever
accorded
this
tank-car
price
in
response
to
a
competitive
offer.
as
to
three
of
them,
there
is
no
evidence,
no
evidence.
mr.
chaffetz
on
thursday
referred
to
commissioner
(inaudible)
opinion
as
containing
this
evidence
when
i
asked
him
for
such
evidence.
you
will
find,
if
you
will
look
at
commissioner
(inaudible)
opinion,
not
a
single
reference
to
a
single
competitive
offer
that
was
made
to
these
three
jobbers
prior
to
the
time
they
were
granted
the
tank-car
price.
in
fact,
commissioner
(inaudible)
opinion
is
quite
different
from
standard's
present
position.
commissioner
(inaudible)
recognized
this
policy,
but
said
that
they
had
the
right
to
continue
it
because
everyone
else
in
the
industry
was
doing
it
and
because
there
were
certain
offers
after
they
had
been
accorded
the
tank-car
price.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think
that's
right
because
when
the
robinson-patman
act
was
passed,
a
seller
could
not
daily
go
along
its
way
without
taking
cognizance
of
this
legislative
act.
congress
expected
some
kind
of
results.
now,
what
could
standard
have
done
suppose
standard
had
said
to
its
jobber
customers,
“look,
we
have
to
comply
with
this
act.
what
we're
going
to
do
now
is
we're
going
to
continue
the
jobber
discount
deal
on
all
of
you
wholesale
sales,
from
the
sales
that
these
jobbers,
some
of
the
jobbers
make
to
other
retailers.
and
on
--
as
to
the
gasoline
which
you
sell
at
retail,
we'll
give
you
a
half
cent
off
because
that
reflects
cost
savings.”
now,
in
that
situation,
we
would
have
a
nondiscriminatory
price
scale.
let's
suppose
then
that
the
situation
arose
in
which
ned's
or
some
other
customer
came
to
standard
and
said,
“look,
the
texas
company
or
gulf
or
over
here
is
--
is
tempting
me
with
a
very
attractive
offer.”
now,
in
that
event,
we
would
have
an
individual
competitive
situation
and
a
--
the
basis
for
a
departure
from
a
nondiscriminatory
price
scale.
but
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
standard
did
nothing
when
the
robinson-patman
act
became
law.
it
just
went
along
as
the
commission
said
relying
on
the
proposition
that
it
couldn't
be
touched
as
long
as
its
competitors
were
using
the
same
discriminatory
policy.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
if
we
had
a
situation
in
which
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
if
we
--
yes.
we
had
a
situation
which
standard
was
--
would
have
made
some
kind
of
bona
fide
effort
to
sell
on
--
at
a
--
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
and
then
the
ned's
situation
came
up.
i
think
that
it
might
very
well
be
a
good
face
up.
for
example,
the
commission
apparently
recognized
that
the
half
cent
reduction
to
ned's
and
that's
what
mr.
chaffetz
was
talking
about
at
some
length
that
this
half
cent
reduction
was
not
--
an
illegal
discrimination
because
there
seemed
to
be
in
that
situation
a
basis
for
saying
that
standard
was
departing
from
its
customary
price
scale.
but
as
to
all
of
these
other
discriminations,
standard
merely
applied
this
dual
price
formula
year
after
year
after
year.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
think,
had
that
situation
existed,
we
--
we
would
then
be
confronted
with
the
problem
of
how
long
could
ned's
have
--
have
enjoyed
this
--
this
discrimination.
i
think
we
have
to
operate
on
the
assumption
by
that
--
that
by
that
time,
these
other
companies,
such
as
texas,
would
have
been
preceded
against
so
that
this
illegal
offer
would
have
been
withdrawn.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
would
say
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
would
--
i
would
be
obliged
to
say
--
i
would
be
obliged
to
say
it
is
inaccurate.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
for
example,
in
the
discussion
with
the
--
mr.
chaffetz
talked
about
this
great
tug
of
war
with
red
indian,
the
fleet-wing
gasoline.
the
president
of
red
indian
was
put
on
the
stand
and
he
was
asked,
“well,
how
do
you
think
your
--
your
brand
compares
with
this
--
with
standard
oil?”
and
he
said,
“oh,
i
--
it
--
it
isn't
anywhere.
it's
--
it
doesn't
have
any
of
or
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
--
we're
nearly
in
public
acceptance
of
those
brands"
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
fleet-wing,
which
was
sold
by
red
indian.
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
if
we
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
yes,
i
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
i
--
i
think
it
might
be.
it
--
it
could
well
have
been
but
on
this
evidence,
and
we've
--
we've
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
on
this
evidence,
the
commission
examined
the
situation.
it
said
there
was
no
cause
or
relationship
between
this
kind
of
offer
and
this,
and
i
can't
imagine
--
mr.
earl
e.
pollock
that's
right.
conceivably,
in
that
situation,
there
might
have
been
a
2
(b)
defense.
we
--
we
happen
to
think
that
the
2
(b)
defense
has
--
has
a
great
deal
of
merit.
now,
speaking
on
behalf
of
department
of
justice
and
not
on
the
part
of
both,
the
commission
and
the
department
of
justice,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
2
(b)
defense
cannot
be
interpreted
so
broadly
as
standard
would
have
this
court
interpret
that,
so
as
to
nullify
the
very
purpose
of
a
robinson-patman
act.
