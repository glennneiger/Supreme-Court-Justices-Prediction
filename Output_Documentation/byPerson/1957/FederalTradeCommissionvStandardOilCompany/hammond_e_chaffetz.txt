mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
take
as
our
point
of
departure
in
this
argument
the
unanimous
agreement,
agreement
of
all
concerned
that
respondent,
standard,
couldn't
hold
to
retain
these
customers
unless
it
gave
them
the
lower
price.
the
condition
so
found
in
its
own
formal
findings.
the
practical
question
from
our
point
of
view
is
whether
despite
the
former
decision,
prior
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case
we
still
have
no
right
to
try
to
hold
these
customers
by
giving
them
the
price
that
we
had
to
give
them
in
order
to
meet
the
lower
offers
of
competitors.
now
the
court
of
appeals
found
--
held,
i
should
say
unanimously
that
standard's
evidence
in
support
of
its
section
2
(b)
defense
firmly
establish
that
defense.
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
basis
in
the
record
for
the
contention
that
it
is
made
here
today
that
standard
pursued
a
pricing
system.
the
court
could
find
no
basis
for
the
contention
in
the
record.
the
court
noted
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
which
on
this
point
supported
the
respondent,
the
finding
examiner
had
found
against
the
respondent
on
the
key
issues
at
that
time.
on
this
particular
point
the
trial
examiner
had
found
for
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
was
impressed
with
the
fact
that
the
commission
didn't
directly
challenge
those
findings
when
the
case
was
before
it.
the
court
noted
also
that
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
the
factual
evidence
that
was
reported
by
the
examiner.
the
court
said
it
could
see
no
basis
for
the
commission's
contention
that
respondent
failed
to
depart
from
its
otherwise
uniform
price
in
specific
instances.
the
court
said
the
contrary
is
affirmatively
established
by
the
record.
we
say
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
squarely
in
accord
with
all
of
the
key
pricing
robinson-patman
cases
of
this
court.
the
court
held
unanimously
beyond
for
it
ventured,
that
all
standard
did
was
to
meet
the
offers
--
the
lower
offers
of
competitors
in
individual
instances.
and
curiously
enough,
the
attorney
general
himself
in
advising
the
senate
judiciary
committee
as
to
what
the
court
below
held
spoke
of
that
decision
in
precisely
those
terms.
the
attorney
general
said
as
we
say
that
that
is
what
the
--
the
lower
court
held.
yes,
it's
part
of
the
background
and
there
is
a
voluminous
background
in
this
case.
i
like
to
just
mention
some
of
the
matters
in
the
record
apart
from
the
evidence
which
tend
to
confirm
what
the
lower
court
did.
the
first
question
we
have
the
trial
examiner's
findings,
unfortunately
in
this
case
the
trial
examiner
did
a
very
thorough
job.
he
summarized
the
pertinent
testimony
under
the
various
questions
that
were
presented.
he
analyzed
the
competitive
offers
the
testimony
concerning
them
and
their
impact
on
the
issue
of
the
good
faith
meeting
of
competition.
and
he
answered
each
of
the
questions.
he,
i
think
very
fairly
distilled
from
the
record
the
essence,
the
essence
of
the
testimony
so
that
if
you
read
his
findings
you
can
see
in
brief
what
the
--
what
the
testimony
was
and
you
won't
find
that
testimony
as
much
as
referred
to
in
the
findings
of
the
commission,
of
the
majority
of
the
commission.
when
the
matter
was
decided
adversely
to
respondent
by
the
commission
and
was
brought
before
the
commission
on
a
motion
for
re-argument
counsel
for
respondent
at
that
time
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record,
as
he
put
it,
controverting
the
good
faith
meeting
of
competition
defense.
and
mr.
walter
b.
wooden,
then
the
associate
of
general
counsel
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
commission's
leading
expert
on
the
robinson-patman
said
to
the
commission,
apparently
no
evidence
controverting
that
defense
was
offered.
the
situation
he
said
is
i
assume
the
same
as
if
that
matter
had
been
conceded.
this
was
in
1946,
if
your
honors
please.
and
then
the
matter
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
legal
question
as
to
whether
the
defense
is
or
is
not
absolute.
and
judge
(inaudible)
writing
for
that
court
at
that
time
said
the
evidence
in
this
record
on
this
issue
is
voluminous
and
we
can
assume
that
it
is
conclusive.
the
case
came
before
this
court
and
both
opinions
--
both
opinions,
the
majority
opinion
and
the
minority
opinion
expressed
the
review
that
the
defense
had
been
made
out
at
least
to
this
extent.
mr.
justice
burton's
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
footnote
distinguishing
the
staley
case,
he
says,
“unlike
that
case,
at
least
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
examiner
here
indicate
that
the
defense
was
made
out"
but
the
commission
refused
to
give
affect
to
those
findings.
and
mr.
justice
reed
in
his
dissenting
opinion
said
that
the
elements
of
the
defense
were
made
out.
the
elements
of
this
defense
were
made
out.
on
remand
a
bare
majority
of
the
commission
after
holding
the
matter
under
advisement
for
some
15
months
and
declining
to
hear
from
us
until
after
these
findings
were
published
and
proposed,
declining
even
then
to
pass
on
the
question
of
lawfulness
of
these
competitive
offers
although
the
mandate
of
this
court
call
for
a
finding
on
whether
the
competitive
offers
were
lawful.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that
was
in
january.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
in
--
in
march
of
1951,
two
months
after
the
case
went
back
from
it's
--
i
go
to
the
commission
and
said
before
you
decide
what
to
do
on
the
mandate,
i
would
like
to
be
heard.
a
full
year
later,
i
received
a
letter
from
the
commission
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
a
full
year
later
i
received
a
letter
from
the
commission.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
it
wasn't
due
to
the
post
office.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
saying
--
this
--
this
is
quite
interesting
because
they
said
in
further
reference,
in
the
--
my
first
letter
had
acknowledged,
in
further
reference
to
your
request
to
be
heard
before
the
commission
takes
any
action
on
the
mandate,
this
is
to
advice
you
that
if
the
commission
should
decide
to
take
any
action
addressed
to
you,
you
will
be
heard.
and
three
or
four
days
later
--
three
or
four
days
later,
i
received
a
copy
of
these
proposed
findings
in
haec
verba
in
which
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
there
had
been
no
hearing
advanced.
but
this
was
on
--
and
i
was
given
an
opportunity
to
come
down
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
--
and
show
cause
afterwards,
after
the
event.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
let's
see
if
i
can
shed
some
light
on
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
they
were
proposed
findings.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
although
they
recited
that
the
commission
is
convinced
that
standard
was
not
in
good
faith
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
--
and
then
they
heard
us
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
on
the
old
record.
the
commission
didn't
entertain
any
motion
as
to
whether
the
record
should
be
reopened.
they
--
they
heard
no
suggestions
from
us
in
advance
of
proposing
their
finding.
you're
right
mr.
justice
douglas,
these
were
proposed
findings
and
when
they
were
sent
to
us
they
were
sent
to
us
with
an
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
let
me
add
to
what
i've
said
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
after
our
oral
argument
before
the
commission
on
these
proposed
findings
at
least
one
of
the
commissioner
--
at
least
one
of
the
commissioner
said
that
he
was
going
to
review
the
record
and
he
did
and
the
actual
findings
weren't
issued
for
many
months,
i
think
almost
a
year
thereafter.
and
commissioner
caretta
prepared
and
published
a
dissenting
opinion,
dissenting
from
these
findings
here.
and
that
dissent
is
of
great
significance
to
--
because
like
the
examiner's
findings
it
is
factual.
it
--
commissioner
caretta
obviously
made
an
independent
study
of
the
record
and
he
summarized
the
evidence
item
by
item,
taking
each
one
of
these
four
jobber
customers.
and
although
we're
told
today
that
there
is
no
evidence,
there
is
no
evidence
with
respect
to
two
or
three
of
those
jobbers
with
respect
to
offers
to
them.
commissioner
caretta
found
a
good
deal
of
evidence
and
he
sets
it
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
on
the
basis
of
which
he
concludes
that
the
respondent
in
meeting
the
competition
in
some
instances
and
refusing
to
meet
competition
in
other
instances
acted
only
as
a
prudent
and
reasonable
person
would
do.
and
so
you
have
on
the
one
hand
these
numerous
appraisals
of
this
record
by
the
very
conscientiousness
and
able
trial
examiner
who
undertakes
to
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
his
analysis
of
the
entire
record.
you
have
the
admission
of
the
associate
general
counsel
before
the
commission
itself.
you
have
the
appraisal
by
a
unanimous
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
appeal.
and
then
you
have
the
caretta
dissent
in
which
commissioner
mason
also
joined.
this
was
a
three-to-two
decision.
you
have
all
that
on
the
one
hand.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
these
findings
of
a
bare
majority
of
the
commission
which
are
not
detailed,
which
are
generalized,
argumentative,
they
do
not
purport
to
illuminate
the
record,
discuss
the
testimony,
they're
pretty
much
directed
at
the
objective
that
the
writer
of
that
opinion
of
those
findings
had
in
mind
or
at
least
i
so
urge.
on
those
--
in
the
case
of
those
circumstances
with
the
court
of
appeals
having
decided
that
there
was
no
foundation
at
all
in
the
record
for
the
system,
pricing
system
argument
that
is
made
here
under
numerous
decisions
by
this
court.
i
think
the
initial
question
here
is
whether
this
court
will
look
further
for
why
it
should
look
further.
at
--
as
this
court
has
said,
the
supreme
court
--
the
congress
has
--
has
denominated
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
initial
reviewer
of
the
findings
and
whether
they
are
supported
by
the
evidence
and
certainly
it
cannot
be
said
in
the
light
of
the
matters
to
which
i've
adverted
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
make
a
fair
assessment
of
the
record.
it
can't
be
said
that
reasonable
people,
reasonable
judges,
and
the
position
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
reached
the
decision
they
did,
if
you
don't
go
beyond
what
i've
already
mentioned
here.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
then
--
then
as
i
say,
commissioner
caretta,
commissioner
mason,
dissented.
that
takes
us
to
sometime
in
the
end
of
the
1952
and
--
and
then
this
is
what
happened.
the
commission
was
reconstituted.
this
was
after
these
findings
--
shortly
after
these
findings
were
promulgated.
the
commission
was
reconstituted
and
the
new
commission
majority
expressed
the
views
to
committees
of
congress
that
were
opposed
to
those
held
by
the
majority
that
had
decided
this
case.
incidentally,
the
majority
that
had
decided
this
case
had
reported
to
congress
that
they
were
in
disagreement
with
the
prior
opinion
of
this
court.
they
thought
it
--
it
restricted
the
proper
scope
of
the
robinson-patman
act
but
now
we
had
a
--
a
reconstituted
commission
and
we
thought
it
appropriate
in
view
of
the
length
of
time
--
do
you
want
--
do
you
want
me
to
stop
and
answer
that
question?
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
have
the
reconstituted
commission
in
the
light
of
the
then
new
policy
of
the
commission
as
expressed
to
congress,
a
new
feeling
about
the
statute.
we
found
it
appropriate
to
ask
them
to
look
at
this
case.
and
what
the
commission
did
was
this,
they
told
the
old
majority
a
week
before
the
effect
of
the
reconstitution
of
the
commission,
they
certified
their
findings
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
protested.
and
we
asked
the
court
to
send
the
findings
back
so
that
we
could
ask
the
commission
to
review
those
findings,
this
newly
reconstituted
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
order,
that's
right.
and
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
at
some
study,
and
that
did
take
some
time,
finally
agreed
with
us
that
under
the
statute,
under
the
statute,
the
commission
didn't
have
authority
to
certify
the
findings
back
and
the
case
went
back.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
thursday
last,
i'd
made
the
point
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
the
court's
holding,
was
squarely
in
accord
with
the
controlling
decisions
of
this
court.
the
attorney
general's
letter
to
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
is
appended
to
our
brief
indicates
that
the
department
of
justice
takes
precisely
the
same
view
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
as
we
do,
namely,
that
it
applied
--
accepted
principles
of
law
and
simply
conformed
to
the
prior
opinion
of
this
court
in
this
very
case.
with
respect
to
the
factual
conclusions
of
the
court
below,
i
pointed
out
that
there
are
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
independent
appraisals
of
the
record
that
are
incorporated
in
the
record.
the
trial
examiner,
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
appeal,
the
dissenting
commissioners,
all
of
which
are
in
accord
with
the
conclusion,
the
factual
conclusion
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
from
which
i
draw
the
conclusion
that
it
might
--
that
it
should
be
rather
difficult
for
anybody
to
assert
now
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
wasn't
rational
and
didn't
reflect
a
fair
assessment
of
the
record.
there
were
just
too
many
other
independent
examinations
of
the
record,
which
came
through
precisely
the
same
conclusion
as
the
--
as
the
lower
court
did.
now,
this
morning,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
some
of
the
highlights
of
the
--
of
the
factual
evidence
to
deal
with
the
competitive
offers,
the
efforts
of
respondent
to
retain
these
four
customers.
i
shall
refer
to
the
fact
that
a
number
of
customers
were
lost
to
competitors
because
of
even
lower
offers
and
then
respondent
was
willing
to
meet.
i
should
talk
about
the
practices
of
--
of
respondent's
competitors
and
point
out
that
the
--
it
isn't
true,
that
--
that
all
conduct
their
business
in
the
same
way
or
even
substantially
the
same
way.
i
shall
point
out
that
the
offers
that
were
made
by
our
competitors
were
not
unlawful
offers.
they
were
on
this
record
and
this
--
and
this
posture
of
the
case
of
lawful
offers
of
competitors.
and
i
shall
point
out
that
many
of
the
competitive
offers
were
from
suppliers
who
sold
only
at
one
price.
i
shall
have
occasion
to
--
to
note
that
gasoline
of
the
standard
oil
company
of
ohio,
the
ohio
oil
company,
pure,
phillips,
cities
service,
aurora,
a
local
refinery.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
precisely,
your
honor.
and
we
do
not
contend,
we
do
not
contend
even
remotely
that
we
were
entitled
to
follow
a
discriminatory
policy
because
our
competitors
were
following
the
same
policy.
if
that
were
the
factual
situation,
i
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
because
if
you
reach
the
point
where
your
only
alternative
is
to
examine
the
entire
record
then
you
fall
back
on
universal
camera,
pittsburgh
steamship
and
--
and
cases
of
that
sort
which
indicate
that
where
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
rational
presents
a
fair
assessment.
this
court
doesn't
sit
to
conduct,
to
make
an
independent
reexamination
of
--
of
the
record.
and
i
think
there's
more
than
enough
in
this
record
to
reassure,
your
honors,
that
it
isn't
necessary
to
examine
the
record.
if
you
look
at
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner,
if
you
look
at
the
dissenting
opinion
of
--
of
mr.
--
commissioner
--
the
commissioner
(inaudible)
and
the
dissenting
opinion
of
--
of
commissioner
mason
and
--
and
the
other
--
and
that
is
in
the
record
to
which
i
referred
on
--
on
thursday.
i
feel
confident
that
you,
too,
will
be
satisfied
that
the
court
below
did
make
a
fair
assessment
of
--
of
the
entire
record.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
may
i
answer
that
question
this
way,
mr.
justice
harlan.
hence,
what
you
mean
by
--
by
response
to,
we
contend
that
if
we
continue
to
give
the
price,
our
price,
to
these
customers
because
of
offers
made
to
them
at
lower
level,
of
lower
offers
made
to
them.
we
were
doing
so
in
response
to
those
offers
because
if
we
would
do
our
lower
price,
we
would
lose
in
this
customer.
now,
let
me
illustrate
that
concrete
and
it's
on
the
record.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
this
is
a
long
history.
it's
a
long
history,
your
honor.
and
i
will
come
to
that.
i'd
like
to
deal
with
how
we
took
on
each
of
these
--
and
what
the
record
show
because
i'll
come
to
that
--
but
--
but
for
the
moment
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
you
have
this
concrete
situation
in
the
record,
a
competitor
made
an
offer
to
two
of
respondent's
customer,
a
lower
offer
than
the
price
that
--
that
respondent
would
make,
lower
than
respondent's
tank-car
price.
the
offer
was
made
to
citrin-kolb
and
another
jobber
that
standard
had
at
that
time,
middleton.
middleton
accepted
the
offer
and
was
lost
to
respondent
as
the
customer.
citrin-kolb
was
persuaded
by
respondent
to
stay
on
despite
the
fact
that
the
other
offer
was
--
was
lower.
now,
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
commission
counsel
here,
it
is,
that
the
--
that
the
respondent
didn't
respond
to
the
offer
that
was
made
to
citrin-kolb
because
we
didn't
do
anything
about
it.
we
simply
continued
to
give
the
--
the
lower
price.
we
contend
that
with
lower
offers
like
that
being
constantly
made
to
our
customers,
we
had
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
give
them
a
price
not
as
low
as
that
offered
to
them
by
our
competitors
and
these
offers
were
continuous
through
the
--
through
the
period
here
in
question.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
not
--
let
me
answer
that
in
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
issue
in
the
case
--
the
issue
in
the
case
as
claimed
by
the
trial
examiner
in
which
all
the
parties
agreed
to
was
what
the
situation
was
after
the
enactment
of
the
robinson-patman
act
in
1936.
but
the
trial
examiner
concerned
himself
with
was
whether
after
that
act
became
law
in
1936,
we
had
a
right
to
keep
these
four
jobber
customers
and
what
we
have
to
do
in
order
to
retain
them
as
such
--
as
in
the
light
of
the
provisions
of
that
statute
and
whether
we
have
to
continue
to
give
them,
the
lower
price
that
they
had
received
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
but
early
history,
it
did
come
into
the
record
and
it
is
illuminating
on
the
circumstances
under
which
we
did
and
i'd
like
to
go
right
to
that
now,
the
circumstances
under
which
we
did
say
to
go
on
these
customers
initially,
even
before
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
entirely,
your
honor.
we
would
say
if
that
was
the
question
presented,
we
lose.
we
--
we
make
no
argument
here
that
we're
entitled
to
pursue
a
discriminatory
policy
because
our
competitors
follow
the
same
--
it's
gone
a
bit
farther.
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
say
first,
the
record
is
clear
that
--
that
respondent
was
set
up
in
detroit,
primarily
on
a
tank-wagon
basis
so,
out
of
their
own
bulk
plant
to
tank-wagon
deliveries
to
dealers.
back
in
1928
was
the
--
was
the
time
that
the
first
of
these
four
customers
became
a
jobber.
that
was
citrin-kolb.
they
had
been
a
retail
dealer
of
respondent
since
1922.
in
1928,
citrin-kolb
decided
to
become
a
jobber,
discussed
the
matter
with
a
former
supplier,
paragon,
wanted
to
know
how
they
went
about
it,
and
they
made
arrangements
to
acquire
bulk
plant
facilities.
and
then
came
to
respondent
and
while
the
record
isn't
--
is
fully
detailed,
as
you
would
like.
the
only
--
all
they're
duly
emphasizing
for
the
record
is
that
--
that
they
said
to
respondent,
“we're
going
to
be
your
jobber
and
we'll
deal
with
you
if
you'll
deal
with
us
as
a
jobber,
otherwise,
we'll
look
--
we'll
look
elsewhere.
then
--
then
after
considerable
negotiations,
citrin-kolb
became
the
jobber
and
bought
at
the
tank-car
price.
the
next
situation
was
in
1931,
that
the
jobber
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
and
they
continued
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
and
they
--
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
separately.
may
i,
in
a
moment,
as
that
also
is
a
very
nice
event,
a
very
nice
question.
in
--
1931
stikeman
organized
for
the
first
time
when
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
1929.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
it
was
a
jobber
in
1929,
customers
in
1922,
retail
customers.
in
1931,
the
stikeman
is
a
new
company,
no
customer
or
anybody
else
started
to
do
business
with
standard.
and
apparently,
as
--
as
a
jobber,
although
the
record
isn't
entirely
clear
but
the
point
we
emphasize
about
stikeman
is
that
very
shortly
after
stikeman
became
a
customer
of
this
firm,
stikeman
was
lost
to
a
competitor
for
an
even
lower
price,
lower
than
standard's
tank-car
price.
and
respondent
was
able,
a
year
later,
to
get
stikeman
back
again,
despite
the
fact
that
the
competitor's
price
was
even
lower.
that
was
the
circumstance
under
which
stikeman
became
a
jobber
customer.
in
1935,
wayne
the
third
of
these
jobbers
became
a
--
a
jobber
customer
of
standard
under
these
circumstances.
wayne
had
been
a
retail
dealer
too,
retail
customer
of
standard's
for
many
years,
since
1931.
in
1933,
wayne
decided
it
wanted
to
become
a
jobber,
and
it
went
to
standard
and
said,
“we
want
to
buy
in
tank-car
prices
so
we
want
to
be
a
jobber.”
and
it
wasn't
until
two
years
later
that
--
that
standard
finally
yielded
and
allowed
wayne
to
become
a
jobber.and
now,
i
want
to
talk
about
the
matter
that
the
chief
justice
laid
did
they
continue
to
sell
at
retail.
of
considerable
significance
is
the
fact
that
when
wayne
became
a
jobber,
it
discontinued
all
retail
business.
it
became
purely
a
wholesaler.
both
had
at
that
moment,
there
was
no
question
under
this
case.
it
wasn't
the
wholesaler
who
also
was
retailer.
and
wayne
didn't
again
sell
at
retail
until
sometime
in
1938
and
only
under
circumstances
where
being
the
owner
of
retail
properties
and
not
having
an
independent
lessee,
from
time
to
time,
wayne
was
compelled
to
operate
the
station
itself
at
retail.
and
this
was
also
true
of
stikeman
and
citrin-kolb.
they
were
wholesalers,
primarily
wholesalers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
some
time
in
1938
up
until
the
time
of
the
testimony,
stikeman
didn't
sell
a
gallon
at
retail.
it
just
so
happened
it
did
have
a
situation
that
wayne
had
after
1938
where
they
had
to
take
over
a
station
from
time
to
time
and
citrin-kolb,
likewise.
they
sold
a
very,
very
small
percentage
of
--
of
gas
they
made
--
from
standard
at
retail.
but
having
said
that,
i
must
come
to
the
ned's
situation,
where
ned's
sold
at
all
times
all
of
the
gas
they
just
bought
from
standard
at
retail.
and
that's
important
because
really,
it's
the
ned's
situation
that
this
case
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
ned's,
n-e-d
apostrophe
s,
your
honor.
that's
what
this
case
is
really
all
about.
there'd
been
no
case
if
only
stikeman,
citrin-kolb
and
--
and
wayne
went
also
so
far
as
retail
sales
are
concerned.
but
--
but
ned's
was
--
was
a
large
--
a
retailer
and
--
and
they
sold
at
a
--
entirely
at
--
at
retail
and
--
and
was
a
price
cut
and
that's
--
that's
--
the
argument
of
this
--
of
this
case.
and
so,
i'd
like
to
take
a
little
more
time
to
tell
you
of
the
history
of
--
of
ned,
the
history
(inaudible)
ned's
has
been
a
customer,
a
retailer,
tank-wagon
customer
of
respondent
since
1918.
the
senior
(inaudible)
founded
the
business
and
he
with
his
five
sons
built
up
that
purely,
retail
business.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
at
four
locations
first,
then
five
and
then
six.
it
was
light
volume
station
to
where
they
became
respondent's
single,
most
important
retailer
customers
in
the
city
of
detroit.
beginning
about
1930,
they
were
confronted
with
one
offer
after
another
from
a
competitor
who
wanted
their
business
at
a
lower
price.
not
a
jobber
price,
it's
not
a
--
not
--
not
as
a
jobber,
but
of
a
substantially
lower
price.
the
examiner
found
that
from
1930
to
1936,
ned's
was
confronted
with
offers
from
numerous
responsible
suppliers
at
lower
prices
than
--
than
respondents
on
gasoline
of
like
grade
and
quality.
ned's
came
to
respondent
finally,
in
1936
and
said,
“you
either
give
us
a
lower
price,
we
want
a
cent
less
or
else.”
when
they
got
--
when
ned's
got
no
satisfaction
from
the
manger
in
detroit,
he
insisted
on
talking
to
the
top
officials
of
--
of
respondent
in
chicago.
he
wrote
a
letter
which
he
called
an
ultimatum
and
he
said
before
finally
breaking
off,
i
want
to
talk
to
the
--
to
--
to
your
superior
he
said
to
the
manager
of
detroit.
they
came
to
chicago
and
the
people
in
chicago
--
i
think
it's
very
interesting
from
the
standpoint
of
the
meaning
of
good
faith
in
what
a
seller
must
do
before
he
demonstrate
his
--
his
good
faith.
the
people
in
chicago
start
to
impress
upon
ned's
that
he's
been
a
customer
of
standard's
for
many
years.
he
said,
"now,
you
really
don't
want
to
leave
us.
your
father
established
this
business.
we
have
a
relationship
here
and
they
worked
that
to
the
last
draw."
but
finally,
sensing
that
ned's
was
serious
and
was
going
to
leave,
they
gave
ned's
a
half-cent
a
gallon
off
in
1936.
and
temporarily,
ned's
accepted
that,
but
they
weren't
satisfied,
and
the
relations
between
ned's
under
the
certain
manager
of
--
of
respondent,
weren't
very
happy
relations
for
the
next
18
months
or
two
years,
while
ned's
is
insistent
that
he
should
have
a
lower
price.
meanwhile,
ned's--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
1936.
meanwhile,
ned's
is
getting
offers
from
--
from
other
suppliers.
and
finally
in
1938,
the
issue
was
brought
up
again
and
ned's
said,
”this
time,
we're
through.
we
get
the
tank-car
price
or
we're
leaving
you.”
ned's
went
out
and
acquired
bulk
plant
facilities
on
his
own
and
it
notified
respondent
that
they
were
going
to
buy
as
a
tank-car
buyer
and
handle
their
own
wholesaling
function
from
respondent
or
someone
else.
under
those
circumstances,
respondent
finally
yielded
and
gave
ned's
the
tank-car
price.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
on
its
own.
ned's
went
out
and
bought
tank-car
storage
and
came
to
respondent
and
said,
“we've
got
tank-car
storage.
we're
going
to
buy
from
you
on
that
basis
or
from
somebody
else.”
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
at
that
time,
in
1938,
we
were
selling
wayne,
stikeman
and
--
and
citrin-kolb
at
the
tank-car
price.
they
also,
having
their
own
storage
facilities
and
performing
the
entire
wholesale
function
themselves
and
so,
it's
yes,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
said
also,
of
course,
at
that
time,
up
until
that
time,
wayne
hadn't
sold
a
gallon
in
retail,
so
there
was
no
question
insofar
as
stikeman
and
citrin-kolb
were
concerned
they
sold
it
only
incidentally
at
retail
from
time
to
time
when
they
had
a
retail
station,
they
didn't
want
to
--
they
didn't
want
it
bulk.
now,
the
point
i
make
is
this.
if
standard
had
a
rigid
policy,
and
a
policy
of
selling
at
two
prices,
jobbers
at
the
tank-car
price
and
dealers
at
the
--
at
the
dealer
price,
whichever
the
customer
chose,
certainly
in
the
case
of
ned's,
that
policy
would
have
been
pursued.
ned's
was
the
biggest
customer
that
standard
had,
the
most
important
customer
that
standard
had.
why
would
there
have
been
such
reluctance
on
the
part
of
respondent
to
--
to
recognize
ned's
as
a
jobber
if
--
if
had
a
policy
of
just
--
just
selling
to
jobbers,
if
--
if
they
bought
on
the
tank-car
basis.
i
think
the
whole
history,
and
--
and
i'd
say
the
trial
examiner
was
--
was
very
much
impressed
with
that,
as
well
as
the
court
below.
the
court
below
said
the
whole
story
history
of
respondent's
dealings
with
ned's
was
inconsistent
within
any
theory
of
a
--
of
a
pricing
system.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
now,
during
this
same
period
that
we're
talking
about,
respondent
also
lost
a
number
of
customers,
some
of
whom
were
already
receiving
standard's
tank-car
price.
others
of
who
wanted
the
tank-car
price
for
standard
refused
to
give
it
to
them.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
the
basis
of
granting
or
denying
was
the
policy
that
standard
had,
which
i
believe
is
a
very
conservative
policy
and
one
which
supports
the
purposes
of
the
act
rather
than
--
than
the
pieces.
this
was
their
policy.
under
no
circumstances,
would
standard
allow
more
than
one
and
a
half
cents
off
of
the
tank-wagon
price
to
any
customer,
to
any
tank-car
or
otherwise.
not
more
than
one
has,
even
though
many
of
its
competitors,
allow
the
jobber
rate
two
cent
differential.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
prevailing
differential
in
the
middle
west
at
that
time
was
about
two
cents,
but
standard
wouldn't
go
more
than
a
half-cent
below
tank-wagon.
secondly,
standard
wouldn't
give
the
tank-wagon
price
to
any
customer
unless
he
performed
the
whole
selling
function,
unless
he
incurred
the
capital
costs
and
the
expenses
of
running
the
wholesale
operation.
this
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
the
tank-car
price.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
said
tank-wagon
price,
that
was
at
the
time.
they
--
they
wouldn't
allow
the
tank-car
price,
the
cent
and
a
half
off,
unless
the
--
unless
the
customer
assumed
that
the
--
the
function
for
which
that
price
was
intended
and
that
--
not
a
great
deal
because
you
have
to
invest
in
large
bulk
--
storage
to
handle
three
grades
of
gasoline.
we
talked
about
only
one
here
but
there
actually
were
--
were
three
grades
of
gasoline.
you
had
to
own
the
trucks.
you
had
to
deliver
and
where
you
sued
outside
customers.
you
had
to
compete
with
others
in
serving
the
--
the
dealer
customers.
i'm
talking
about
citrin
and
wayne
and
--
and
stikeman
that
when
they
sold
to
the
two
of
the
retailer.
you
had
to
furnish
free
gobs
and
free
pumps
and
cave,
driveways
and
--
and
all
that
kind
of
thing.
and
this
was
--
one
and
a
half
cent
so
it
was
all
they
got
that
what
we
say
about
that
is
that
that
the
effect
of
this
policy
of
standards
far
from
showing
the
purpose
or
effect
of
violating
the
robinson-patman
act
was
to
--
to
show
that
--
that
we
were
trying
to
conform
at
least
with
the
spirit
of
the
statute,
did
not
give
a
discrimination
unless
it
was
substantially
offset
by
a
cost
incurred
by
the
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no.
the
finding
was
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
we
had
a
cost
justification.
we
had
a
cost
justification
defense
which
--
which
failed
and
i
wanted
to
address
myself
to
that,
too,
because
there
was
a
problem
in
--
in
the
record
on
that.
the
trial
examiner
did
find
that
that
function
could
be
performed
for
half
a
cent
and
that
was
a
manifest
error.
i
--
i
might
say
that
it
would
seem
to
me,
at
least,
rather
obvious
that
if
you
allow
a
cent
and
a
half,
and
that's
the
general
fact
that's
in
entry
or
if
it
allowed
two
cents,
which
is
what
most
jobbers
has
got
below
tank-wagon.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
assume
that
--
that
all
it
costs
the
jobber
was
a
half
a
cent,
and
that
he
kept
the
three
times
or
four
times
as
much
as
this
cost.
now
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no.
it
didn't
--
that
was
a
collateral.
it
was
a
collateral
point.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
it
doesn't
bear
on
the
good
faith
at
all,
really,
but
--
but
it's
--
it's
simply
background
color,
but
i
do
want
to
point
this
out
because
our
plans
make
a
good
deal
of
that
fact.
they
assume
this
half-cent
to
be
--
to
be
the
cost.
now,
where
the
trial
examiner
got
into
error
there
was
the
competitor
of
ours
testified
that
he
could
perform
the
operation
for
half
a
cent
but
his
circumstances
were
entirely
unlike
ours
or
our
customers.
that
was
a
company
that
sold
only
one
grade
of
gasoline.
it
had
a
system
of
--
of
deliveries
to
selected
stations,
no
less
that
2000
gallons
per
delivery
and
you
took
it
when
your
turn
came,
whereas,
we
and
our
customers,
our
jobber
customers
who
sold
at
retail,
so
we
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
it
doesn't,
you
honor.
although
the
--
the
--
one
of
the
key
findings
--
one
of
the
key
findings
of
the
--
of
the
--
commission
majority
here
was
just
that.
they
said,
"because
we
failed
on
our
cost
justification
defense
that
defeated
our
good
faith.”
that
is
one
of
the
findings
in
one
of
the
legal
conclusions
of
--
of
the
--
but
i
don't
really
think
he
does
--
the
only
thing
he
does,
is
go
to
the
court
--
will
understand
that
this
one
and
a
half
cent
lower
price
that
we
made
wasn't
a
arbitrary
lower
price.
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
giving
one
customer
full
cent
and
a
half
less
than
another
customer.
that
one
and
half
cent
was
substantially
offset
and
the
two
of
our
jobbers
who
testified
about
their
cost
testified
that
their
cost
fairly
approximated
the
--
the
cent
and
a
half.
ned's
cost
might
have
been
a
little
bit
lower
because
ned's
was
fully
integrated.
ned's
also
did
a
lot
of
other
business.
ned's
sold
sporting
goods
and
household
appliances
and
--
and
things
of
that
sort.
now,
the
testimony
was
--
was
this
during
this
period,
1936
to
1940,
the
crucial
period
here,
the
testimony
was
that
competitors
were
constantly
trying
to
proselyte
our
jobber
customers.
the
examiner
repeats
that
testimony,
reports
that
testimony
in
--
in
his
--
in
his
findings
and
the
examiner
was
--
was
entirely
satisfied
that
--
that
unless
--
through
that
period,
we
gave
these
because
at
least
this,
this
was
the
minimum,
cent
and
a
half
cent
low
where
they
perform
the
function.
we
had
no
hope
of
keeping
them
as
customers
because
competitors
were
offering
them
constantly,
substantially
lower
prices
and
competitors
were
constantly
trying
to
take
these
customers
away.
let
me
illustrate
that
point
in
this
way,
i
can't
possibly
try
to
give
the
--
the
record.
but
take
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
time
the
testimony
was
taken
here.
i
think
it
is
highly
significant.
but
even
while
the
testimony
is
being
taken
before
the
examiner
and
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
each
one
of
these
jobbers
were
engaged
in
serious
negotiations
with
the
competitor,
where
the
competitor
was
offering
an
even
lower
price
than
respondent
was
giving
at
the
time.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
with
what?
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
first,
there's
no
finding
here,
although
this
court
afforded
the
commission
and
the
officers
to
make
the
finding.
there's
no
finding
here
that
any
offers
by
our
competitors
were
unlawful.
the
commission
just
didn't
make
that
finding
and
we're
assuming
that
--
that
these
offers
were
unlawful.
but
to
answer
your
question
further,
mr.
justice
black,
it
just
so
happened
that
these
offers
that
i
have
in
mind
that
were
made
at
the
time
of
this
--
the
complaint
was
filed,
one
or
two
--
just
after
the
complaint
was
filed
and
before
the
test
was
taken
were
offers
by
--
by
competitors
who
sold
only
in
one
price.
they
were
not
discriminatory
prices
at
all.
let
me
take
one
of
those.
the
national
refining
company,
then
a
well-known
company,
in
cleveland,
ohio,
that
sold
throughout
the
middle
west,
in
--
in
michigan,
but
had
no
outlets
in
detroit
were
seeking
to
set
up
a
distribution,
to
set
up
distribution
in
detroit
and
they
went
to
two
of
our
four
customers,
wayne
and
stikeman.
they
said,
“we
will
give
you
a
better
quality
gasoline
than
standard's
at
a
lower
price
if
you
will
do
business
with
us.”
now,
it
so
happens
that
the
precise
offer
from
national
to
these
two
customers
postdated
the
complaint,
came
in
after
the
complaint
but
the
negotiations
had
been
in
progress
before
the
date
of
the
complaint.
and
i
don't
think
the
day
of
the
complaint
is
significant,
anyway.
this
thing
looks
to
the
--
looks
to
the
future.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
examiner
ruled
out
that
evidence
initially
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
evidence
after
complaint,
but
the
commission
itself
reversed
the
exam
and
held
that
the
evidence
was
valid.
during
the
same
period,
i
come
back
to
ned's
because
i
--
as
i
said,
i
think
ned's
is
--
is
the
key
situation
here.
ned's
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no.
it's
factual.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
sir.
i'm
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that
--
that
--
yes.
yes.
except
--
yes.
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
i'm
talking
about
the
fact
situation.
i'm
emphasizing
the
facts
with
respect
to
ned's
because
that's
the
key
situation.
i
think
the
record
indicate
that
ned's
is
--
what
--
what
brought
this
case
about.
and
--
and
so
far
as
ned's
is
concerned,
but
throughout
the
period
--
throughout
the
period,
ned's
had
offers
from
--
from
other
competitors.
i
want
to
talk
about
one
of
those
only.
one,
of
standard
ohio
company,
fleet-wing
gasoline
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that
was
a
continuous
offer.
ned's
was
buying
its
motor
oil
from
--
from
fleet-wing
and
--
and
they
were
trying
to
get
his
gasoline
business
and
the
commission
of
majority
recognized
that
that
offer
was
--
was
extent
down
to
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
--
what
will
they
say
about
that
offer?
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that
fleet-wing
gasoline
didn't
have
the
same
public
acceptance
as
respondent's
product.
but
i'm
using
this
just
to
illustrate
that
point.
this
--
this
is
comes
up
--
oh,
this
--
but
what
i
have
to
say
will
cover
the
whole
situation.
and
he
said,
“fleet-wing
gasoline
didn't
have
the
same
--
but
you
didn't
have
to
worry
about
losing
ned's
to
--
to
fleet-wing.
he
wouldn't
have
bought
fleet-wing
gasoline.
on
that,
i'll
say
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
the
testimony
about
how
close
ned's
came
to
--
to
taking
fleet-wing
gasoline
and
you
realize
that
--
that
the
commission
isn't
giving
effective
testimony
to
the
realities,
to
--
to
what
did
take
place.
theirs
is
a
logical
argument
and
not
a
--
a
factual
argument.
let
me
say
also
that
the
commission
was
in
error
--
was
in
error.
they
misunderstood
the
record
when
they
said
fleet-wing
gasoline
didn't
have
the
same
public
acceptance.
they
said
it
was
an
offbrand.
they
misread
the
trial
examiner's
findings,
where
he
said
--
where
he
said
with
respect
to
fleet-wing
and
several
others
that
they
--
including
cleveland,
were
in
direct
and
immediate
competition
with
respondent's
product
and
have
the
same
acceptance
in
the
public
mind.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
1938,
standard
lost
another
customer
to
fleet-wing
gasoline,
(inaudible)
miller,
who
--
who
did
leave
standard
to
buy
fleet-wing
gasoline.
and
fleet-wing
had
something
like
a
hundred
stations
with
their
name
of
--
and
this
was
the
standard
oil
company
of
ohio
gasoline.
this
wasn't
a
third-rate
--
a
--
a
third
rate
product.
so
--
so
the
commission
was,
factually
wrong
there
with
effect
of
whether
it
did
have
public
acceptance,
but
most
important
--
i
don't
guess
is
real.
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
you
or
i
believe
that
this
gasoline
was
plumbable.
it's
whether
ned's
was
ready
to
give
up
respondent's
gasoline
to
deal
with
fleet-wing
at
a
lower
price
and
the
record
is
--
is
just
conclusive
on
that.
one
--
one
thing
before
i
leave,
that
standard's
policy,
it's
very
important
here,
the
policy
of
not
giving
more
than
a
cent
and
a
half
and
refusing
--
it's
as
our
friends
on
the
other
side
emphasize,
“we
wouldn't
even
give
a
lower
price
to
keep
a
customer”
they
say,
which
shows
how
rigidly
we
adhere
to
our
policy.
respect
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
don't
see
the
issues
the
same
way,
your
honor.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
don't
have
any
--
we
didn't
have
any
pricing
system.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
sir.
what
we
say
is
to
hold
a
customer.
to
hold
a
customer,
we
--
we
would
do
that.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
no,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
their
contention.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
their
contention.
we
deny
the
record
shows
that.
and
--
and
the
court
below
addressed
itself
directly
to
that
question
and
found
to
the
contrary
and
said
there
was
no
support.
the
court
below
said,
“we
can't
find
any
support
in
the
record
for
such
a
system
contention,”
and
they
said,
“the
history
of
our
dealings
with
ned's
belies
that
contention.”
that
was
the
court
below.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
don't
believe
the
commission
actually
found
that.
commission's
findings
aren't
entirely
satisfactory,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
say
so.
now,
what
they
did
say
was
this
--
what
the
commission
found
was
this.
they
said,
“these
offers
--
let
me
take
again
an
illustration.
they
said,
“in
1939,
citrin-kolb
had
an
offer
from
the
argo
oil
company
--
of
gasoline
of
the
ohio
oil
company,
and
i
think
with
(inaudible)
they
say,
“obviously,
that
offer
in
1939
couldn't
have
been
put
in
evidence.
so,
why
citrin-kolb
was
recognized
as
a
jobber
in
1929?
the
offer
in
1939,
couldn't
have
been
used
by
us
to
--
just
to
show
why
citrin-kolb
was
made
a
jobber
in
1929.”
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no.
as
i
--
i
think
that
was
tongue-in-cheek.
it's
so
obvious,
but
the
commission
does
say
that
in
--
in
so
many
words.
they
say
this
evidence
must
have
been.
this
is
what
they
said.
this
evidence
must
have
been
offered
by
respondent
to
show
the
need
for
continuing
to
give
the
tank-car
price
to
citrin-kolb.
but
obviously,
of
course
that's
why
--
several
case
the
examiner
made
that
entirely
clear.
but
the
commission
does
--
do
say
that.
then
they
go
on
to
say,
“having
reviewed
these
offers
that
we
on
account
of
this
testimony,
had
--
must
have
had
reason
to
believe,
or
did
have
reason
to
believe
that
we
would
lose
these
customers
if
we
didn't
continue
to
give
them
the
lower
price.
but
they
said
that
the
reason
our
customers
were
going
to
get
the
lower
price
was
that
our
competitors
were
following
the
same
system
we
were.
they
didn't
use
the
word
"system."
i
think
that's
important
too.
commission
and
its
finding
didn't
refer
to
staley,
didn't
say
anything
about
pricing
system.
what
it
said
was
we
had
our
method
of
policy
and
the
method
of
policy
was
the
one
that
we
relied
on,
as
i've
said,
that
we
wouldn't
give
more.
but
they
said
they
call
that
a
method
of
policy
and
they
said,
“our
competitors
had
a
similar
policy,
so
it
was
only
logical
to
believe
that
our
customers
would
get
lower
prices
from
our
competitors.”
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
no.
now,
that
--
that's
correct.
we
did
it.
we
used
the
word
“system”
back
in
1940,
but
we
didn't
mean
system
in
the
staley
sense.
we
were
talking
about
something
else
and
i'd
like
to
talk
about
our
answer,
too.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
--
that
--
that's
the
next
point
i
was
coming
to
is
just
what
we
said
in
--in
1940.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
before
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i'd
--
i'd
be
delighted
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
first,
let
me
just
say
this,
and
i
want
to
come
to
the
chief
justice's
point
but
i'll
reach
it
this
way.
i
want
to
make
clear
here
that
there
was
no
system
in
detroit.
there
was
no
price
uniformity,
even
remotely,
nothing
like
cement,
staley
the
national
lead.
prices
were
figuratively
all
over
the
law.
some
people
sold
at
--
at
one
and
a
half
cents
off
of
the
prevailing
tank-wagon,
some
two.
some
required
bulk
plant
facility,
some
didn't
and
some
just
gave
odd
--
odd
prices.
there
was
nothing
systematic
about
pricing
in
--
in
detroit.
and
so,
were
far
removed
from
--
from
staley.
there
was
no
system
with
respect
to
method.
it
wasn't
as
though
everybody
--
so,
there
are
both
dealers
and
jobbers,
and
that's
the
picture
that
i
think
commission
counsel
has
started
to
--
to
present
here,
that
everybody
sold
in
the
same
way
and
they
say
that
--
that,
”sure,
we
justify
our
lower
prices
because
of
offers
from
competitors
and
they
would
do
likewise.”
well,
that
just
isn't
so.
i
think
the
majority
of
the
offers
here
were
from
competitors
who
didn't
sell
dually,
who
didn't
sell
to
both
jobbers
and
dealers.
they
sold
only
at
--at
one
price.
so
--
so,
there
was
no
system
even
with
this
industry-wise
or
--
or
generally
to
--
no
system.
such
as
i
think
was
pictured
here
on
--
on
thursday.
now,
how
do
we
get
to
--
our
--
our
having
to
use
the
word
“system”
and
--
and
i
must
say
that
this
--
this
argument
of
--
of
the
government
is
the
more
we
market
in
that
--
as
i
understood
the
argument
the
other
day,
they
tell
the
court
that
this
case
was
disposed
of
when
we
filed
our
answer.
they
say
in
our
answer,
we
defeated
our
own
defense
and
they
say
that
all
the
evidence
they
rely
on
is
the
evidence
that
we
are
in
support
of
our
defense
and
they
say,
“that
shows
that
we
won
in
good
faith.”
i
just
point
that
out
to
suggest
that
there
is
something
rather
strange
about
that
situation.
it's
seventeen
years
later
--
17
years
later,
the
government
wakes
up
to
the
fact
that
in
1940,
we
talked
ourselves
out
of
court.
but
what
happened
was
this.
because
of
this
policy
that
we
had,
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
of
refusing
to
give
this
lower
price,
except
where
the
customer
performed
the
wholesaling
function
and
stuff.
that
situation
gave
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
you
can
call
it
a
system.
it's
a
label.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
you
can
call
it
--
i
--
i
shy
away
from
the
word
“system”
because
“system”
in
the
context
here,
to
me
means
staley.
it
means
cement.
it
means
the
kind
of
thing
your
honors
referred
to
in
--
in
the
cement
decision,
where
you
said
that
with
that
kind
of
a
system,
there
was
no
chance
of
anybody
ever
losing
a
customer.
the
industry
saw
to
it
that
every
customer
got
the
same
price
delivered
at
the
same
point
with
those
chances.
this
is
just
the
reverse
of
that.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
not
just
reverse
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
sir.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
did
it
--
we
did
it
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
--
we
did
it
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
had
three
defenses.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
had
three
defenses
originally,
your
honor.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
right.
that's
the
one
(inaudible)
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
--
that's
right.
but
--
but
the
government
preferred
to
rely
on
a
different
defense
that
we
raised
in
1940,
and
that's
where
this
argument
--
other
argument
--
we
--
we
asserted
in
our
answer
three
defenses.
one
of
them
was
cost
justification.
because
we
made
them
take
over
the
functions,
there
was
obviously
an
area
of
--
of
cost
justification.
secondly,
because
we
were
so
careful
in
classifying
our
customers,
jobbers
on
the
one
hand
and
dealers
on
the
hand,
we
have
the
defense
of
--
of
functional
classification
of
customers
and
that
was
the
defense
that
we
asserted
and
we
said,
“that
because
these
were
honest-to-goodness
jobbers
and
were
recognized
in
the
industry
and
in
all
other
industries.
there
wasn't
only
two.
we
said
jobbers
of
well-known
all
over
because
we
were
careful
to
distinguish
between
jobbers
on
the
one
hand
and
preferred
to
lose
customers
rather
that
to
give
a
jobber
price
to
a
man,
unless,
he
was
a
jobber.
we
said
that
gave
us
a
defense
of
--
of
functional
classification
of
customer.
the
examiner
found
on
that,
only,
it
didn't
sustain
out
of
fancy,
found
on
--
on
that
--
only
that
what
we
did
was
arbitrary,
as
--
as
the
commission
claim.
but
we
didn't
say
that
that
was
our
only
defense.
we
have
that
defense.
we
have
cost
justification
and
we
have
the
principal
defense,
of
meeting
competition.
and
in
our
answer,
if
you
read
our
whole
answer,
which
i
think
you
have
to
do
if
you
could
read
the
defense
that
isn't
theirs
here
which
is
appended
to
the
government's
brief.
in
our
brief,
we
appended
the
--
our
allegations,
our
government's
with
respect
to
meeting
competition
in
good
faith,
and
--
and
the
whole
story
as
later
was
proved
in
the
record
was
--
was
pointed
out
as
to
why
we
gave
the
lower
price,
only
as
we
said
in
individual
emphasis
in
order
to
keep
a
customer.
that
was
our
defense
in
1940.
we
haven't
changed
our
position
when
--
when
i
ordered
except
that
we
are
not
now
not
pressing
these
other
two
defenses
here.
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
--
is
on
this
one
defense
that
we
heard
in
1940.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
black.
what
we
did
was
this,
and
what
we
said
at
that
time,
in
our
answer,
if
you
read
that
whole
answer,
it
says
that
we
refuse
to
give
the
lower
price
to
anybody
except
to
meet
competition
in
good
faith
and
even
then
--
even
then
we
wouldn't
do
it
unless
the
man
was
bona
fide
a
jobber.
that
was
a
--
this
--
this
a
lower
price
to
--
to
the
jobber
or
recognition
of
the
jobber
was
a
maximum
kind
of
thing,
not
a
minimum
kind
of
thing.
it
wasn't
a
systematic
thing.
it
was
a
systematic
thing
we
have
had
many
jobbers.
we
did
that
selling
to
jobbers
as
we
sell
to
dealers.
we
dealt
with
each
of
these
customers
as
an
individual
situation
and
in
doing
so,
in
dealing
with
them
as
an
individual
situation,
we
did
three
things.
we
were
careful
to
be
sure
that
we
only
gave
them
the
price
that
we
had
to
give
to
this
competition.
secondly,
we
wanted
to
reserve
a
price
justification
defense
by
refusing
to
give
them
this
lower
price,
unless,
they
had
offsetting
cost.
and
thirdly,
we
wanted
to
also
reserve
the
customer
classification
defense
that
we
were
only
giving
a
jobber
price
to
--
to
a
jobber.
what
i
say
is
we
went
beyond,
far
beyond
what
section
2
(b)
required.
we
tried
to
preserve
additional
defenses,
but
it
was
not,
your
honors,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this.
there
was
in
a
situation
where
we
just
had
two
crises
and
anybody
who
was
a
jobber
got
the
jobber
first,
anybody
who
would
do
would
do
that
that
was
not
a
system.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
let
me
--
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
there
is
not
--
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
anybody
else
in
any
other
company
had
the
same
policy
we
did.
this
conservative
policy
of
ours
of
refusing
to
sell
except
where
they
--
they
had
their
own
bulk
plant,
so
there's
no
evidence
that
any
other
competitor
had
that
policy.
the
evidence
as
to
what
competitors
did
is
a
generalized
kind
of
evidence.
they
sold
to
jobbers,
some
sold
to
dealers
and
jobbers.
no
indication
as
to
whether
--
whether
they
like
we
gave
a
maximum,
cent
and
a
half,
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary.
some
of
them
gave
two
cents.
no
evidence
that
they
like
we
insisted
that
the
jobber
have
bulk
plant
facilities.
several
of
our
customers
were
lost
to
competitors
who
gave
them
the
one
and
a
half
cent
price
even
though
they
didn't
have
bulk
plant
facility.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
there
is
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
well
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that
is
the
finding,
i
must
say
that.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
the
finding
that
ned's
is
sold
cheaper,
but
i
think
that's
the
first
case.
that
was
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
right.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we're
relying
here
solely
on
the
defense.
we
have
to
convince
this
court
that
the
lower
court
was
correct
in
finding
as
a
fact
--
in
finding
as
a
fact
that
we
departed
from
our
otherwise
uniform
tank-wagon
price,
only
where
we
had
to,
to
keep
a
customer.
that
--
that's
all
this
case
is
about
and
--
and
my
time
is
about
up.
i
want
to
say
this
in
conclusion,
which
i
think
is
--
that
it
is
significant
here.
the
question
that
brought
the
case
here,
the
certiorari
question,
was
the
question
which
justice
black
just
has
--
did
post,
whether
we
are
entitled
to
continue
to
give
a
discriminatory
price
because
our
competitors
were
giving
a
similar
discriminatory
price.
i
say
that
question
isn't
in
the
record.
it
isn't
raised
by
the
opinion
below.
the
opinion
below
says
that
there
--
that
question
isn't
here,
the
record
is
--
is
to
the
conflict.
not
only
that
but
the
petition
for
certiorari
refer
to
the
three
companion
cases,
which
said
would
be
governed
by
this
case.
those
companion
cases
were
shortly
after
dismissed
even
--
dismissed
on
a
motion
--
on
a
motion
of
staff
council,
the
commissioner
had
been
pending
for
two
years
before
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
the
dismissal
was
shortly
after
the
--
the
grant
for
certiorari
here.
so
part
of
the
effect
to
this
case
on
the
companion
case
is
concerned
sorry
i'm
just
about
to
have
--
and
they
also
said
that
there
were
other
cases
pending
in
the
court
below
involving
systematic
pricing
and
this
case
would
have
a
direct
impact
on
those
cases.
it
just
so
happens
that
those
cases,
the
automotive
parts
case
which
are
now
here,
didn't
involve
the
issue
of
this
case
and
i
say
that
assuredly
because
counsel
on
neither
side
nor
the
court
itself
had
any
occasion
to
mention
this
case
in
those
cases.
those
cases
were
not
affected,
didn't
involve
the
issue
here.
i
think
the
issue
here
is
--
is
a
narrow
issue,
the
one
that
mr.
justice
black
just
--
just
gave,
the
factual
issue.
did
we,
on
traditional
ground,
(inaudible)
question
of
law.
traditional
ground,
did
we
come
within
staley?
the
language
stated
where
it
said
did
you
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
you
had
to
give
the
lower
price
to
the
competitors.
now,
i
say
is
that
the
court
examined
that
question
and
--
and
came
down
with
--
with
firm,
factual
conclusion,
which
is
supported
by
a
whole
series
of
other
appraisals
in
the
record,
all
--
all
to
the
same
effect.
on
the
universal
camera
--
on
the
universal
camera
and
pittsburgh
steamship
and
all
of
those
other
case
i
can't
imagine
this
court
is
going
to
undertake
a
new
review
of
that
pure
factual
question.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i'm
sorry.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
--
i
had
thought
that
i'd
answer
the
question.
let
me
summarize
in
a
sentence,
too,
this
way.
as
i
say,
the
commission's
findings
are
not
satisfactory.
you
can't
parse
them
that
--
that
easily.
but
i
have
a
different
understanding
of
them
now
after
hearing
the
argument
here
than
i
had
when
we
were
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
they
decided
--
here's
--
here's
what
they
said.
recognizing
that
this
evidence
of
offers,
as
they
say,
probably
was
--
was
shown
to
demonstrate
that
we
had
to
give
these
lower
prices
in
order
to
keep
the
customers.
they
say
"that
doesn't
overwhelm
us
because
they
said
you
had
a
--
a
policy
and
your
--
your
competitors
had
a
--
a
similar
policy
and
they
were
bound
to
get
the
--
the
lower
prices.”
and
--
and
that
they
said
is
only
the
background,
only
the
background
for
their
real
decision
and
curiously
enough,
the
real
grounds
of
the
court
--
of
the
commission's
findings
haven't
been
mentioned
here
yet.
with
that
background,
they
said,
"because,
of
course,
we
--
we
could
expect
that
our
customers
would
get
lower
prices
from
competitors
because
do
they
followed
the
same
practice
as
we
did.
they
said,
"in
those
circumstances
--
in
those
circumstances,
we
should
have
looked
around
and
had
we
looked
around,
we
would
have
discovered
that
our
lower
prices
were
bound
to
cause
injury
to
competition."
and
that
they
said
proves
bad
faith
and
they
also
said
that
we
should
have
had
reason
to
believe
that
our
lower
prices
couldn't
be
cost-justified
and
that
shows
bad
faith.
it
--
it
was
things
of
that
sort
and
when
we
argued
before
the
commission
and
we
went
to
the
court
below,
those
stood
in
our
mind
as
the
real
ground,
a
legal
ground
of
the
commission's
decision
against
it.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
they
weren't
even
as
precise
as
that.
they
--
they
use
the
same
word.
they
said,
"we
had
a
policy
or
method
and
our
competitors
likewise
had
a
similar
policy."
but
they
were
very
careful
to
avoid
pinning
it
down
to
just
what
our
competitors
had
and
did.
did
our
competitors
have
the
same
policy
we
did?
did
they
sell
to
both
the
jobbers
and
--
and
dealers
that
--
that
we
did.
and
that
comes
up,
mr.
justice,
in
this
way,
if
i
may
have
just
30
--
a
second
more.
we
were
assured
here
that
if
we
do
lose
these
customers,
it
will
only
be
temporary
and
that
the
commission
will
promptly
proceed
against
our
competitors
who
they
say
have
the
same
policy
and
practice,
but
nowhere
do
they
tell
us
what
they
will
do
about
fleet-wing,
argo,
national
refining
--
these
whole
series
--
whole
series
of
--
of
competitors
who
sell
only
in
one
price,
whose
price
isn't
even
discriminatory
apart
from
the
question
whether
or
not
it
could
be
cost
justified
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
--
or
was
lawful
and
insult
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
well,
the
point
is
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
--
the
point
is
they
say
that
they're
going
to
treat
our
customers
the
same
as
--
as
they
treat
us
and
they're
going
to
stop
everybody
from
doing
it.
but
they
overlooked
the
fact
that
you
don't
stop
everybody
from
doing
it
unless
everybody
is
doing
the
same
thing
we
do
and
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
the
record
shows
the
contrary,
and
they're
vague
on
that,
mr.
justice
black,
in
their
finding,
the
findings
are
very
vague.
it's
generalized
language.
there
is
no
finding
that
the
practice
was
uniform
or
--
or
that
extensive
answer.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
right.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
but
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
with
the
permission
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no.
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
in
just
one
sentence.
had
we
done
what
the
commission
suggested
we
ought
to
do,
we
would
have
been
in
bad
faith?
had
we,
because
we
gave
this
lower
price
to
ned's,
offered
the
same
price
to
all
other
similarly
situated,
then
we'd
had
no
good
faith
defense
because
we
had
no
evidence
that
we
had
another
customer
whom
in
order
to
retain
him
as
a
customer,
we
had
to
give
this
lower
price
to.
we
didn't
rely
on
the
customer
classification
on
the
theory
that
we
were
offering
the
same
price
to
everybody
similarly
situated.
had
we
done
so,
we
wouldn't
have
been
here
today.
we'd
have
lost
this
case
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
well,
the
record
is
so
--
or
the
--or
the
other
way.
here
--
here's
the
situation.
first,
we
set
this
up
in
our
answer,
"is
it
conceivable?"
is
it
conceivable
that
we
set
this
up
in
our
answer
if
it
defeated
that
--
the
staley
case
you
know
was
before
the
commission
at
that
time,
the
cement
complaint
had
been
filed
in
1937.
this
isn't
new.
but
we
didn't
set
up
a
pricing
system
in
our
own
defense
at
that
time.
we
thought
that
we
were
in
good
faith
to
this
extent
and
i
think
today
on
this
record
before
this
court,
it
demonstrates,
rather
negative
i
should
say.
i
think
we
would
not
have
been
in
good
faith
if
we
gave
this
same
price
to
everybody
who
came
along
and
--
and
asked
for
it,
who
also
had
a
bulk
plant
facility.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
who
was
similarly
situated.
we
would
not
have
been
in
good
faith.
we
would
have
forfeited
our
defense
that
we're
relying
on
here
today.
we
can
only
use
that
defense
and
only
give
that
lower
price
to
the
particular
customer
to
whom
we
had
to
give
that
customer
in
order
to
retain
it
as
a
customer.
i'm
very
sorry
to
--
i'm
over
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you
for
your
valuable
time.
