you
tried

the

tried
to
get

up

couldn't

justice

would
that

were

was

made

in

more
than

is
any

justice

did

would
that

to

violating

when
was

it's

don't
quite
understand

laid.
justice

what
about

justice

well,
did
you
provide
that

did
the
evidence
show
or
was
there
a
finding

there
was
a
system
under
the
which
you
would
give
people
that
equipment

ned's
to
secure
the
(inaudible)
justice

i
understand
you
say
that
--
justice

but
if
you
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
through
the
pricing
system.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
not
based
on
the
difference
in
cost
but
based
on
the
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
certain
equipment
this
man
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
deny
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
record
shows
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
what
they
found
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
dispute
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
that
was
the
system,
i
think
that
you
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
not
true
here
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
admit
you
saw
that
by
admitting,
do
you
not,
that
you
did
sell
to
ned's
cheaper
than
you
sold
to
other
wholesaler.
though
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
people
agreed
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
just
--
justice
hugo

black
--
justified

justice
hugo

black
--
on
the
ground
that
you
had
to

to
meet

low
price.
justice

but
that's
the
one
that's
narrowed
to
now.
justice

l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
i
don't
quite
understand
you.
i
understand
that
you
defended
them
and
you
still
say
that
you
had
this
factor,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
under
which
you
classified
as
jobbers,
people
whom
they
say
are
not
going
to
try
these
jobbers,
in
the
general
sense.
and
that
you
sold
to
those
people
at
a
lower
price
than
you
sold
to
your
other
customers
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

i'm
trying
to
get
just
what
the
issues
between
--
what
they
say
is,
as
i
understand
it,
the
argument
if
there's
some
findings
at
all
that
the
evidence
there
is
that
you
had
this
system
or
this
--
this
method,
whether
you
followed
it,
to
their
a
reference
to
everybody
or
just
followed
to
the
reference
of
a
certain
one
is
that
you
had
to
subtract
nothing
and
that
the
other
people
picked
up
your
method
and
competed
with
you
on
the
basis
of
your
method
as
given
to
these
people
they
call
jobbers,
the
same
kind
of
price
lower
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
of
whether
ned's
sold
cheaper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
on
account
of
the
discounts
you
gave
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
his
competitors
did
and
the
retail
vendors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
unless
you
have
a
--
is
that
what
you
claim
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
did
it
in
good
faith
to
meet
competitor's
price
within
whatever
meaning
that
you
had,
you
have
no
defense
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
mentioned
one
thing
that
found
(inaudible)
it
seems
rather
important
to
me
in
connection
with
the
answers.
as
i
understand
it,
the
commission
has
found
that
you
used
the
classification
of
a
jobber
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
was
not
a
true
classification.
you
called
him
a
jobber
when
he
wasn't
a
jobber.
he
was
competing
with
retailers
who
were
retailing
and
they
say
that
from
that,
you
can
find
that
it
was
not
good
faith
that
he's
been
(inaudible)
for
you
to
reduce
that
price,
you
didn't
say
anything
about
it.
you
never
did
say
anything
about
it.
you
didn't
tell
your
other
customers.
you
didn't
tell
anybody
that
you
were
doing
--
classifying
this
man
as
a
jobber
or
not
to
correct
it
is
illegal.
you
--
you
put
it
on
that
basis
rather
than
to
meet
prices
of
competitors
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
you
put
it
right
and
right
or
wrong
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
when
that
happens
on
that
basis
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
one
couldn't
have
found
that
that
infers
if
that
was
your
reason,
even
though
you
say
none.
if
you
have
a
--
which
seemed
on
its
face
to
be
plausible,
you'd
classify
them
as
a
jobber,
you
gave
him
a
special
rate
for
that.
would
they
--
would
they
infer
from
that
you're
--
go
get
your
cover-up
(voice

--
justice

who
was
similarly
situated.
justice

would
you
state
succinctly
what
you
consider
the
question
of
law
to
be?
justice
hugo

before
you
do
that,
do
you
--
in
answering
the
question,
i
want
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
--
you
said
they
had
a
discriminatory
system,
if
he
does,
what
was
that?
