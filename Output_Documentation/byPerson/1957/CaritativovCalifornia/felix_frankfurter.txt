justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
interrupting
you
if
you
stated
what
proposition
of
law
you're
here
to
earn?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
what
are
the
questions
of
law
on
which
you
solicit
a
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
this
first
question
is
a
pure
question
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
why
all
of
this
and
why
do
we
--
why
do
you
take
the
time
into
all
these
preliminaries?
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
the
first?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
not
necessarily?
are
they
at
all
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
be
relevant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
second
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
second
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
at
that
point,
what
have
been
the
pleadings
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
the
only
plea
could
have
been
at
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
does
pled
not
guilty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore
the
trial
would
be
on
that
plea
of
not
guilty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
insanity
--
the
issue
of
insanity
is
--
is
that
tried
before
the
same
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
--
would
that
plea
of
--
contingent
plea
of
insanity
have
to
be
known
by
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
philosophy
behind
the
california
legislation
is
to
sever
the
two
questions
and
not
have
a
single
jury
be
confused
by
two
very
disparate
issues,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
they
are
through
with
the
merits
so
to
speak
of
the
conviction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
it
true
that
they
wanted
to
keep
the
issue
of
mentally
irresponsibility
out
of
the
case
and
make
it
a
separate
traversable
issue
after
guilt
has
been
determined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
the
practice,
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
suppose
you
had
served
nothing,
you
went
to
the
trial
of
--
of
the
main
issue
under
california
law
in
case
the
defendant
had
been
--
he
was
convicted,
would
you
then
have
been
barred
from
saying,
“your
honor,
i
now
enter
--
i
now
--
or
to
bring
to
your
honor's
attention
that
person
just
convicted
is
insane
and
i'm
already
going
to
the
issue
on
that.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
california
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
apparently,
what
do
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
is
it
--
why
is
it
--
it
may
be
a
wrong
interpretation
but
why
is
it
an
unconstitutional
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
unconstitutional
for
california
to
say
in
the
light
of
the
experience
one
has
had
in
american
criminal
trials
about
the
defense
of
insanity,
counsel
must
make
that
charge
at
the
beginning
to
say
that
(a)
their
client
didn't
commit
the
crime
or
if
he
did,
he
was
insane
at
the
time
but
we
tried
the
issue
separately?
what
is
unconstitutional
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
prepared
to
tell
this
court
that
it's
the
adjudication
of
california
that
if
a
counsel
is
defending
a
person
for
murder
or
a
burglary
or
whatnot,
without
any
possible
basis
for
claiming
insanity
at
the
time
when
he
puts
--
puts
in
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
that
goes
to
issue,
but
that
it's
subsequent
without
any
reason
for
a
non-disclosure
before
or
knowledge
before,
if
subsequently
knowledge
has
come
to
counsel
that
in
fact
you're
dealing
with
a
mentally
unbalanced
person
or
a
mentally
sick
person
or
whatever
the
phrasing
of
your
statutes
are,
that
such
subsequently
acquired
knowledge
would
not
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
the
plea
of
insanity
then
tried
after
conviction?
are
you
prepared
to
tell
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
already
knew
yourself,
by
your
own
statement,
indicated
that
something
was
stirring
in
your
mind
that
made
you
wonder
whether
this
fellow
wasn't
insane.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
had
some
previous
knowledge
and
is
not
the
case
that
i
put
to
you,
namely
where
there's
no
basis
for
putting
in
a
plea
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
contingently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you,
the
trial
court
said,
“if
you
want
to
make
that
plea
contingently,
make
it
now,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
you
were
in
a
position
then
and
there
to
put
in
that
contingent
plea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
establish
for
me
at
least,
one
further
adjudication
of
california
courts,
namely
that
if
you
didn't
know
at
the
time
you
examined
the
jury
on
the
main
issue
and
therefore
wouldn't
brought
--
wouldn't
examine
him
on
the
voir
dire,
use
of
insanity
that
if
that
same
jury
is
impaneled
to
try
the
issue
of
insanity,
you
wouldn't
have
another
chance
of
having
an
examination
of
the
man
there
abused
regarding
insanity.
has
that
been
established
by
california?
you're
asking
us
to
make
a
lot
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judgments
of
the
california
law
which
may
only
not
being
settled
but
unless
it
is
settled,
we
can't
speculate
that
all
this
carefully
constructed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
scheme
of
california
is
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you
say
has
been
--
what
you
tell
us
is
the
construction
of
the
california
scheme
of
guilty
because
of
--
despite
insanity
or
because
of
it,
what
you
say
has
been
the
construction
is
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
law
of
about
46
states
in
this
union,
namely
that
you
must
make
your
examination
of
voir
dire
even
in
order
to
acquit
your
client
or
let
him
go
or
on
the
question
of
insanity,
that's
the
common
place
for
it.
and
this
measure
in
california
was
the
so-called
“forward
measures,”
as
i
believe
it
so
have
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
taking
your
time
because
i
don't
want
you
to
assume
your
short
time
on
this
second
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
considering
what
i
deemed
to
be
the
gravity
of
the
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
the
procedure
is
arbitrary,
not
that
he
as
a
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
linn,
am
i
to
infer
that
you're
suggesting
that
this
case
could
go
off
on
the
proposition
that
on
this
record
--
on
this
record,
it
does
not
appear
that
the
california
statute
precludes
the
opportunity
of
a
person
in
the
position
of
this
petitioner
to
have
at
least
an
adversary
proceeding
before
the
warden?
you
want
us
to
go
up
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
question
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
raising
it
--
you're
suggesting
that
if
--
that
if
a
proposal
had
been
made
at
some
recognized
and
properly
accredited
psychiatrist
had
been
asked
by
mr.
davis
to
participate
in
this
determination
by
the
warden,
he
would
have
had
admission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
that
on
this
record
we
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
it
--
on
its
faith
so
to
speak
is
not
before
us,
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
putting
this
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
pass
--
i'm
the
last
person
who
wants
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
or
any
other
statute
unless
i
have
to.
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
whether
i
do
have
to
pass
on
the
statute
as
written
or
whether
i
can
avoid
that
by
saying
as
a
matter
of
practical
construction
mr.
davis
didn't
avail
himself
of
a
channel
of
inquiry
that
was
opened
to
him,
that
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
care
about
preference.
i
mean,
my
responsibility
on
the
basis
of
the
coercion
of
the
record,
not
preference.
we're
not
here
giving
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
favoritism.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
linn,
you
have
a
responsibility
which
i
know
from
previous
experience
you're
very
scrupulous
in
discharging.
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
does
this
record,
in
addition
to
what
you've
just
told
us,
permit
me
--
and
i
can
only
speak
of
my
own
response
to
them
--
permit
me
to
say,
“we
don't
have
--
i
don't
have
to
decide
the
constitutionality.”
i
--
i
can
say
that
this
may
--
the
case
may
go
back
to
california
where
on
proper
application
of
an
appropriate
psychiatrist,
the
warden
will
let
him
in.
can
i
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
did
--
you
did
your
duty,
if
i
may
say
so,
in
the
phyle
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
in
your
view
with
the
respondent,
representing
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
in
your
view
there
was
a
procedure
of
whom
--
through
state
action.
and
that
being
so,
the
constitutional
question
couldn't
be
reached,
not
as
a
matter
of
preference.
this
isn't
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
that's
a
proof
of
sanity,
mr.
linn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
that's
a
proof
of
sanity
on
my
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
positive
answer,
isn't
it?[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
average
number,
mr.
linn?
what
is
--
during
the
last
five
years
or
--
has
been
the
average
number
of
capital
state
prisoners
right
for
execution
in
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
mooney-holohan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
the
perjury
part.
are
you
suggesting
a
disposition
similar
to
that
of
the
nature
which
was
made
by
this
court
in
mooney
against
holohan,
namely
a
finding
that
the
denial
of
any
opportunity
or
review
would
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process
clause,
but
that
this
court
is
not
prepared
to
say
there
wouldn't
be
some
relief
in
the
california
courts?
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
will
you
please
state,
just
sketch
the
order
that
you
want
this
court
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
supreme
court
has
already
said
that
whether
or
not
this
was
not
the
same
or
it
is
--
it's
not
a
matter
for
judicial
determination
or
for
determination
in
any
other
way
or
by
any
other
tribunal
except
the
warden
of
the
prison.
isn't
that
what
your
supreme
court
has
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
that's
not
what
the
--
isn't
that
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
what
you
should
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
statute
--
your
supreme
court
says,
"the
law
of
california
bars
us
from
going
into
this
matter
and
the
law
of
california
in
barring
us
is
not
unconstitutional."
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
how
can
i
escape
the
passing
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
setting
it
aside,
it's
construing
the
california
statute.
it
has
construed
it
to
allow
no
--
it's
--
it
is
construing
it
to
hold
to
require
that
the
warden
has
not
only
the
last
say,
but
the
only
say.
and
it
is
further
that
any
--
that
that
is
not
a
violation
before
this
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
it
was,
the
supreme
court
of
california
wouldn't
sustain
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
just
what
they'd
held
unless
i
can
read
english.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
said
we
can't
cancel
this.
what
the
warden
has
done
no
matter
what
the
basis
for
his
judgment
is.
that
is
one
of
those
things
that
is
not
susceptible
of
being
reviewed
beyond
the
conflicts
of
the
warden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
they
have
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
not
quarreling
with
your
being
here.
i'm
--
i'm
confused
by
the
offer
you
made
to
me
but
i
i
don't
have
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
--
yes,
and
you
haven't
yet
done
it
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
failure
words
on
your
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes
and
--
or
the
statute
as
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
are
not
dealing
with
abstractions
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
supreme
court
of
california
construed
the
statute,
validated
it
and
implying
they
had
validated
it
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
one
must
reach
the
validity
or
the
correctness
of
that
determination
which
means
reaching
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
he
didn't
write
the
opinion
of
the
court,
and
it
is
his
fair
little
incumbent
to
find
out
what
he
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
implies
but
you
just
wanted
to
exclude
the
possibility
that
we
will
read
the
other
petitions
and
saying,
"although
i'm
insane
man,
i
take
this
california
statute
regarding
constitution."
of
course
we
would
state
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
must
get
down
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
want
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
regardless
of
the
fact
you
assert
but
that
the
place
in
--
as
it
did
whether
the
facts
or
what
they
asserted
is
with
warden
and
nowhere
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
aren't
--
these
aren't
mathematically
incontestable
so-called
factual
issue.
they're
all
matters
of
judgment
of
--
between
--
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
warden
shall
be
the
exclusive
determiner
of
these
--
more
or
less,
as
we
sit
back.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
justice
harlan
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
are
reasons
for
not
depositing
such
ex
parte
authority
in
the
warden.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
corroborate
language,
that's
what
you
say
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
at
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
this
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
little
earlier,
you've
indicated
that
you're
not
urging
judicial
review
and
regular
adversary
court
proceeding.
i
thought
you
said
that
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
point
is
not
the
factual
situation
to
their
factual
situation
but
that
the
protection
of
the
interest
that
you're
here
to
protect,
the
human
interest,
do
not
have
--
do
not
require
judicial
protection.
i
understood
your
statement
a
little
while
ago.
you
said
that
you
don't
mean
that
you
have
to
have
a
regular
a
against
--
jones
against
the
commonwealth
of
the
state
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
require
a
jury
or
a
judge.
it
may
all
began
--
it
was
some
other
tribunal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
mean
all
judicial
protection
of
this
court
in
saying
it
can't
be
done
by
the
warden
all
by
himself
in
the
secrecy
--
secrecy
of
his
own
conscientious
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
that,
you
don't
have
to
say
it
must
be
done
before
judge
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
must
it
be
done
by
a
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
helps.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
have
fairness
before
--
before
a
warden
or
before
the
state
court
of
parole
or
whatever
you've
got
out
of
fairness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
need
judicial
protection
necessarily.
and
so
you
may
need
judicial
protection
to
get
fairness
to
the
appropriate
instrument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
regard
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
regard
the
non-execution
of
a
person
who
had
some
insane
after
his
sentence?
do
you
regard
the
non-execution
of
an
insane
person
as
an
act
of
mercy
and
grace
similar
to
the
commutation
of
a
death
sentence
to
a
life
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
you
to
relate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
just
like
a
pardoning
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
notion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whether
--
but
whether
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
governor
of
--
but
whether
a
governor
of
california
shall
commute
a
sentence
from
death
to
life,
depends
on
the
particular
outlook
and
the
particular
contentious
judgment
of
the
particular
occupant
at
sacramento
on
the
question
of
death
sentence
as
against
life
sentence,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
known
in
eastern
--
in
two
eastern
states
where
the
governor
himself
initiated
such
action
because
of
his
own
views
on
the
case
before
us.
so
that
that
--
you're
in
different
realm,
and
you're
in
the
realm
of
the
pardoning
power
of
governors
and
a
statutory
policy
expressing
the
law
of
centuries
that
you
don't
execute
an
insane
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
man
most
involved
and
fatally
involved
doesn't
get
a
chance
to
put
his
case,
well,
those
on
his
behalf
to
put
their
case
by
a
sister
of
this
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
judicial,
i'm
just
saying
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
therefore
not
to
say
judicial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
what
you're
implying
is
subject
to
comment,
namely
that
considering
the
due
process
is
what
it
is,
an
appropriate
way
of
protecting
certain
rights.
can
one
say
that
the
kind
of
reliance
that
a
state
or
even
this
court
may
rightfully
attribute
to
the
action
of
a
governor,
does
not
necessarily
apply
in
anything
like
the
equal
measure
to
the
conduct
of
a
warden?
this
is
no
reflection
on
wardens
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
when
you
deal
with
the
highest
officer
of
the
state,
the
symbol
of
its
magistrate,
then
you
may
say
that
by
virtue
of
that
very
office
there
are
protections
just
as
for
myself.
there
are
protections
in
the
home
office
with
its
tradition
etcetera,
etcetera
and
the
system
of
parliamentary
inquiry
that
may
very
well
and
in
my
opinion
does
offer
an
adequate
substitute
for
our
due
process.
and
you
can't
say
because
what
we
did
in
--
in
--
and
i
accept
that.
i
start
from
there
as
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
we
did
as
to
the
investing
power
of
the
governor,
ergo
necessarily
imply.
you
can
do
the
same
thing
as
to
wardens.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
the
--
the
governor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
a
reprieve.
there's
--
there's
the
flattest
question
that
emphasize.
you
have
here
a
granted,
a
formally
granted
right
which
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
this
situation
and
individualized
intervention
of
a
governor
with
all
the
views
that
different
governors
have
in
deciding
whether
a
man
should
go
to
his
death
or
not.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
grace.
there's
a
statute,
and
the
statute
based
on
three
or
four,
in
the
years
of
the
common
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
am
i
to
suggest
that
the
governor
of
california
probably
has
some
other
troubles
except
to
oversee
everything
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
over
that
the
statute
has,
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
bases
this
in
the
warden
and
what
was
suggested
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
there
are
a
lot
of
subsidiary
protections
to
see
to
it
that
the
warden
isn't
an
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
it
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
he
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happened
over
those
four
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happened
over
those
four
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
went
up
with
the
burden
of
this
--
from
my
point
of
view,
our
greatest
delays
in
enforcing
the
criminal
law
in
almost
every
state
of
the
union
on
--
on
the
embarrassment
that
it
was
caused
to
have
somebody
present
putting
the
defendant's
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
the
basis
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
upon
which
he
should
make
the
determination,
not
whether
he
should
make
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
this
statute
--
when
did
the
statute
originate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
this
crime
--
when
was
the
crime
committed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
year.
