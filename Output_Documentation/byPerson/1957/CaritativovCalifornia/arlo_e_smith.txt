mr.
arlo
e.
smith
your
honors,
it's
been
suggested
by
petitioner's
counsel
that
--
asked
the
question
that
this
case
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
law
of
california
is
clear
and
unequivocal
that
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
the
warden's
determination
of
an
inmate's
insanity.
that
he
and
he
alone
makes
the
determination
as
to
demand
sanity
of
the
type
of
execution.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
with
the
exception
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
the
statute
is
framed
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
he
has
reason
to
believe,
good
cause
to
believe.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
if
he
does
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
has
a
due
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
that's
correct,
you're
honor.
he
does
not
act.
there
is
a
presumption
that
he
has
no
reason,
no
good
cause
to
believe
that
the
man
is
insane.
as
argued
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
not
reviewable.
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
as
i
have
pointed
out,
your
honor,
the
real
sense
is
a
review
here.
the
power
to
grant
a
reprieve
is
granted
to
the
governor
of
california
under
article
vii.
and
in
a
sense,
there
is
a
review,
if
petitioner's
counsel
or
petitioner
is
unsatisfied
with
the
warden's
determination,
he
may
always
proceed
to
the
governor
to
seek
a
reprieve.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
correct,
without
any
type
of
adversary
hearing.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
assuming
that
he's
inaction
was
arbitrary,
the
--
the
review
would
be
in
a
sense
my
appeal
to
the
government.
but
of
course,
would
--
we
cannot
assume
that
a
--
executive
officer
will
act
arbitrarily
and
that
a
judicial
officer
will
not
act
arbitrarily.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
would
be
acting
--
the
--
that's
correct.
if
he
acted
arbitrarily,
he
would
not
be
following
the
statute.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
do
not.
i
believe
that
the
california
decisions
are
clear
that
there
is
no
review,
that
even
no
judicial
review,
even
though
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
warden
has
acted
or
his
inaction
is
arbitrary.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
under
california
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
could
not.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
my
interpretation
of
california
law.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think,
your
honor
that
it
is
related
to
the
power
to
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
commute
the
party.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
i
have
--
i
have
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think,
your
honor
that
that
proposition
can
be
maintained
as
a
--
can
be
maintained
as
a
matter
of
common
law
precedence.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
that
--
that
is
true.
california,
we
do
not
have
a
policy
of
executing
insane
people.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
or
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
our
law
--
our
statutes
provide
that
a
man
shall
not
be
executed
if
he
is
insane.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
the
procedure
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
it
might
at
a
question
of
pardon.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well
--
well,
our
--
in
california,
the
--
the
expressly
--
not
only
the
power
to
pardon
and
commute
but
also
the
expressed
power
to
grant
a
reprieve
which
is
a
mere
stay
or
under
common
law,
is
a
common
law
term
where
the
condemned
person
is
consult
or
insane.
but
of
course,
such
a
proceeding
before
the
governor
would
be
initiated
by
petitioner
or
his
counsel
who
would
present
to
the
governor
or
his
secretary,
his
version
of
the
facts
concerning
the
man's
insanity.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
concede
that
that
is
a
policy
of
california,
but
it
doesn't
and
it
may
even
be
a
due
process
requirement
that
such
a
policy
exist
in
a
state.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
it
does
not
follow.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
it
does
follow
from
either
as
a
matter
of
due
process
or
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
that
the
procedures
to
determine
that
man's
sanity
are
regulated
by
due
process
that
there
is
any
fixed
method
or
manner
of
making
this
determination
that
it
must
be
a
judicial
determination,
that
it
must
be
an
adversary
hearing.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
there
is
a
procedure
in
the
statute.
the
warden
has
the
duty
of
making
that
determination.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
any
judicial
type
hearing?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
is
in
a
judicial
type
hearing.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
or
an
administrative
type
hearing.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
there
are
--
are
--
there
are
several
states
who
operate
similarly
to
california
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
his
dissent
in
the
solesbee
versus
balkcom
case
as
set
out
in
great
detail,
the
procedures
followed
by
the
various
states.
many
states
follow
the
--
a
procedure
similar
to
california.
some
states
have
no
procedure
set
up.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
number
of
--
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
there
are
--
there
are
several.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
there
are
some
which
--
which
provide
a
judicial
determination.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
do
not
recall
of
any.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
they
are
not.
they're
in
--
they're
all
set
out
in
--
in
the
dissent
in
the
solesbee
versus
balkcom
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
think
that
that's
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer
and
that
it
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
is
not
related
to
this
problem
for
this
reason
that
we
--
we
are
talking
there
about
procedures
which
go
to
the
validity
of
the
judgment,
the
judgment
of
conviction.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
the
validity
or
any
procedure
which
affects
the
validity
of
the
judgment
of
conviction
which
would
require
a
judicial
type
hearing.
that
is
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
i
think
that
is
clear.
that
the
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
in
an
element
which
would
go
to
the
--
to
the
validity
of
the
judgment,
must
be
--
the
determination
must
be
made
in
a
judicial
type
hearing.
but
here,
we
have
an
admittedly
valid
judgment
of
conviction,
a
judgment
of
conviction
after
a
trial
on
both
the
issue
of
guilt
and
on
the
issue
of
sanity.
the
jury
has
determined
this
man
to
be
sane,
to
have
been
sane
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
in
all
of
these
facts,
but
two
exceptions
were
filtered
through
the
jury.
all
of
these
matters
were
presented
to
the
jury.
the
jury
determined
that
william
francis
rupp
was
sane
under
the
mcnaughton
test.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
even
though
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
but
we're
not
talking
about
the
judgment.
we're
talking
about
a
procedure
after
the
judgment
in
the
nature
of
--
of
power
to
pardon
commute
a
reprieve.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well
--
well,
that's
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
that's
true
as
a
general
proposition,
but
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
which
brings
me
to
the
observation
that
i
was
about
to
make
and
that
is
that
if
this
court
follows
its
prior
decision
in
solesbee
versus
balkcom,
the
only
mistake
the
california
legislature
made
if
it
made
a
mistake
and
denied
due
process
--
the
mistake
it
made
in
which
resulted
in
the
denial
of
due
process
was
to
grant
these
petitioners
a
greater
right
that
was
necessary
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
solesbee
versus
balkcom.
in
other
words,
the
power
to
grant
a
reprieve
which
is
a
common
law
of
reprieve
or
purposes
where
the
--
where
the
condemned
person
is
insane
is
placed
by
the
constitution
in
the
governor.
now,
in
addition
to
this,
our
legislature
has
added
to
the
penal
code,
section
37
--
3701
which
provides
that
the
warden
if
he
has
cause
to
believe
that
a
man
is
insane
shall
certify
him
to
the
district
attorney
of
the
county
which
the
prison
is
for
trial
on
this
question.
now,
under
the
solesbee
case,
the
legislature
had
not
made
such
a
prohibition
but
had
simply
left
this
power
to
be
exercised
by
the
governor
and
to
make
it
identical
with
solesbee
to
have
adopted
the
procedures
which
are
actually
utilized
by
the
warden,
that
is
to
say
reports
from
his
medical
and
psychiatric
stand
to
be
furnished
to
the
governor,
we
would
have
solesbee
versus
balkcom
right
in
point.
so
that
if
california
has
denied
rupp
and
caritativo
due
process
of
law,
by
this
procedure,
it
has
denied
it
them
due
process
only
because
it
has
given
them
a
greater
right
than
this
court
has
held
necessary
in
the
decision
of
solesbee
versus
balkcom.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
so,
my
point
is
that
this
power
still
exists
in
california,
in
the
governor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
the
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
expressly
by
the
california
constitution,
the
power
to
grant
a
reprieve
is
given
to
the
governor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
but
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
he's
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
and
he's
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
corrections.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
certainly,
the
governor
would
have
the
independent
power
to
grant
a
reprieve.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
that
he
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
he
has
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes,
i
point.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
addition.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
california
constitution
places
that
responsibility
with
the
governor.
that
this
is
an
additional
protection
offered
by
the
--
by
the
state
government
of
california.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
article
7.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
it
says
that
the
governor
has
the
power
to
grant
pardons
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
commutations
and
reprieves.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
that
--
that
is
not
the
particular
power
that
we're
talking
about.
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
not
--
to
my
knowledge,
no.
there's
never
been
any
allegation
of
discriminatory
application
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
--
except
to
the
implication
that
it
was
--
that
his
action
here
is
--
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no.
there's
no
allegation
in
terms
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
no.
i
might
add
or
finish
on
this
note.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
no,
i
think
that
a
question
of
alleged
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
due
process.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
that
the
--
that
the
wisdom
of
this
court
in
both
the
noble's
and
the
solesbee
case
in
--
in
this
--
is
contained
in
its
statement
that
if
we
are
required
to
provide
a
judicial
type
review
of
these
proceedings
that
an
execution
will
depend
upon
the
ability
of
a
prisoner
to
draft
a
petition
and
present
it
to
the
court
for
review,
that
this
will
become
an
endless
proceeding
as
indicated
by
the
records
in
the
--
in
these
cases.
in
this
case,
petitioner
rupp
was
convicted
approximately
four
years.
there
are
no
facts
in
this
petition
that
were
unknown
to
anyone,
at
that
time.
yet,
the
first
suggestion
of
insanity
comes
four
years
later.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
after
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
many
collateral
attacks
upon
the
judgment
by
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
what?
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
well,
it
was.
that's
correct.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
they
waited
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
warden
of
course
ultimately
is
--
is
the
only
man
who
can
determine
the
insanity
or
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
execution.
since
sanity
is
a
condition
and
a
status
which
is
subject
to
change.
any
judicial
determination
is
meaningless.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
while
--
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
while
the
judicial
body
or
other
tribunal
is
deliberating
his
insanity,
he
may
become
insane.
the
only
person
who
can
make
the
determination
and
bring
that
determination
up
to
the
time
of
the
--
the
execution
is
the
warden.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
the
statute
--
this
one
originated
in
1872
and
preceded
it
the
criminal
practice
of
that
in
substances
back
with
1851.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
there's
no
judicial
review.
that's
on
phyle
versus
duffy
case.
phyle
versus
duffy
puts
no
problems
on
the
governor.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
when
you
came
to
the
noble's
case,
there's
--
or
your
--
your
solesbee
case,
the
only
review
was
the
governor.
the
governor
here.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
that's
--
that's
true
and
what
the
court
said,
"we
have
--
we
cannot
reach
the
constitutional
point."
they
just
decided
the
constitutional
point.
i
don't
believe
we
can't
reach
it
because
of
these
other
matters.
they
reached
--
this
court,
i
believe,
reached
it
in
the
solesbee
case.
mr.
arlo
e.
smith
yes.
i
think
we
reached
it.
