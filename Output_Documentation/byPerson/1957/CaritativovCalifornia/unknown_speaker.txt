i
have
one
--
one
point
here
that
(voice
overlap)
the
judgment
against
a
statute,
3700
was
immediately
precedes
3701.
it
reads,
"there's
no
judge
of
the
court
or
officer
other
than
the
governor,
can
suspend
the
execution
of
the
sentence,
judgment
of
death,
except
the
warden
of
the
state
prison
whom
he
is
delivered."
so
that
--
in
other
words,
the
statute
directly
imply
that
the
governor
in
his
entirety.
