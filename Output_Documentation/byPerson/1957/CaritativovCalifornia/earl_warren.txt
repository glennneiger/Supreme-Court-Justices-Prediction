wherein
did
he
not
follow
this
proscription?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
is
that
--
is
that
your
position
that
at
all
of
events,
the
courts
must
pass
upon
this
and
that
the
warden
cannot
have
the
last
word.

chief
justice
earl

well,
what
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you?
what
--
what
is
the
practice
in
other
states?
what
it
takes
in
states
that
are
comparable
to
california
and
--
and
tell
me
what
their
procedure
is
there?
do
they
--
do
they
operate
somewhat
similarly
to
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
many?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
that
have
the
--
a
procedure
such
as
that
contended
for
by
the
petitioners
in
these
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
in
your
briefs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
warden
isn't
entirely
in
the
non
--
a
not
--
autonomous
officer
in
california,
is
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
has
more
than
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
me
as
awarded
a
prison
terms
with
paroles
that
has
jurisdiction
over
the
prisoners
and
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
prisons
so
far
as
their
--
their
punishment
is
concerned
and
then
it
has
a
director
of
--
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
corrections
over
him
was
responsible
for
the
entire
--
entire
prison
system
and
then
he
asked
the
governor
over
him
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
any
of
them
or
at
least
the
--
the
governor
and
the
director
would
have
the
right
to
direct
him
to
do
one
thing
or
--
or
another.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
do
you
think
he
doesn't
oversee
what
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
warden
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
we're
not
mistaken
because
it's
very
important
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
very
important
part
of
his
duty.
