are
you
saying
that
that's
what
you
understand
the
law
to
be
that
he
can
do
that
if
he
wants
to?

justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
rather
note,
mr.
linn
made
a
very
fair
presentation
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
under
due
--
due
process
clause,
forbid
him
to
make
a
final
--
make
a
final
decision.
justice

(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
it
doesn't
permit
him
to
say
--
say
the
last
words
before
it
have
to
pass
when
they
pass
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
would
determine
whether
it
was
fair,
whether
the
warden
is
doing
fairly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
you
do
it
in
view
of
the
fact
that
counsel,
the
state
of
california
has
declared
it
to
be
the
law.
there's
no
insane
person
shall
be
executed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
a
question
of
policy,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
that
it
says
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
meant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
necessary
for
it
to
be
a
due
process
requirement
here
that
such
a
policy
that
you
have,
a
statute
which
tells
everybody
in
california,
"you
cannot
be
executed
if
you're
insane."
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
instead
of
having
some
--
suppose
instead
of
having
separate
statutes
which
says
that
in
order
for
an
insane
person
to
be
executed
in
your
definition
of
murder,
you
define
the
murder
and
says,
"this
shall
not
apply
to
any
insane
person."
then,
you
would
consider
to
divide
the
trial
of
--
in
two
parts.
one,
to
try
the
man
for
murder,
the
other,
to
have
the
warden
decide
as
you
do
here
that
he
is
not
sane?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
statute
steps
in
and
says
even
though
this
is
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
cannot
be
executed
and
carry
out
this
jury
verdict
if
he's
insane.
justice
hugo
l.

(voice

that
the
state
doesn't
have
to
provide
you
the
law,
many
privileges
it
doesn't
have
to
afford.
many
safeguards
and
securities
not
required
by
the
due
process
clause
to
the
grant
which
if
it
does
grant,
with
be
administered
in
accordance
with
the
rights
granted
under
other
laws
of
the
state,
cannot
be
arbitrary

hugo

if
you
want
to
call
it
their
denial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
about
that
because
that
to
me
is
the
important
thing
in
this
case.
i
--
if
the
state
had
not
passed
the
statute
at
that
time,
it
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
certainly
then
reach
the
due
process.
