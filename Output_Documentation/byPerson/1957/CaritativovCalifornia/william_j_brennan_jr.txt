brennan,
jr.
and

justice

j.
brennan,

reviewable,
rebuttable,
however
you
put
it.
whether
he
acts
on
much
or
little
on
hearing,
on
personal
inquiry
or
no
inquiry
at
all,
if
he
does
nothing
and
doesn't
proceed
further
with
a
--
as
a
statute
permits
as
i
understand
it,
doesn't
it?
some
kind
of
proceeding
he
may
then
again.
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
no
one
may
look
into
what
he's
done
or
how
it
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
go
further.
even
if
it
could
be
established
that
his
inaction
were
arbitrary,
stubborn,
obsolete
or
any
reason
could
any
court
inquire
into
it
under

as

california

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
supreme
court
has
interpreted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
suggests
something.
if
there
were,
well,
do
you
think
your
california
supreme
court
decision
would
embrace
such
a
charge
as
also
non-reviewable
judicially?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
you
have
your
own
equal
protection
clause.
you
have
your
own
state
equal
protection
clause
within
your
topic.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
has
it
been
interpreted
as
the
equal
protection
clause?
