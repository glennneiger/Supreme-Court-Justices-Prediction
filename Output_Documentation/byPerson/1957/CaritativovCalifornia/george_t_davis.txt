mr.
george
t.
davis
may
it
please
the
court,
and
counsel
at
the
counsel
table.
this
case
involves
the
two
questions
which
have
arisen
in
connection
with
the
trial
of
a
man
named
bart
luis
caritativo.
both
of
these
questions
have
to
do
with
a
question
of
due
process
in
the
application
of
certain
california
statutes.
statutes
are
different
and
i
think
that
if
i
could
make
a
thumbnail
statement
about
the
facts
of
the
case
i
will
bring
the
questions
to
the
court's
attention
most
quickly
and
more
to
the
point.
caritativo
was
arrested
in
marin
county
which
is
a
suburb
of
san
francisco
and
charged
with
murder,
the
murder
of
two
people.
he
was
arrested
sometime
in
late
1954
and
he
was
brought
to
trial
in
january
of
1955
before
a
superior
court
judge
with
a
duly
impaneled
jury
and
at
that
time
he
had
two
lawyers
who
were
representing
him
and
under
california
law
which
requires
that
if
you
are
going
to
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
that
must
be
a
separate
plea.
there
are
two
pleas
that
must
be
made.
this
man
had
only
entered
by
and
through
his
lawyers
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
now,
an
unusual
thing
happened
in
this
case
pretty
much
without
precedent
in
many
respects.
on
the
second
day
of
the
trial
after
witnesses
had
testified
for
the
prosecution,
mr.
caritativo
unexpectedly
to
all
concerned
got
up
in
the
courtroom
and
made
a
statement
that
he
wanted
to
change
lawyers.
i
believe
they
were
three
or
four
or
five
prosecution
witnesses
who
had
already
testified,
the
jury
had
been
impaneled
of
course
and
the
trial
was
on
and
he
got
up
and
made
the
statement.
the
trial
judge
stopped
the
trial,
asked
him
what
his
reasons
were
for
changing
lawyers.
and
he
said
in
effect
that
he
no
longer
trusted
his
lawyers.
he
vacillated
somewhat
about
it,
but
the
judge
then
took
an
adjournment
and
said
in
effect
i'm
going
to
look
into
this.
there
was
a
hearing
in
chambers
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
he
was
questioned
again
why
he
was
discharging
his
lawyers
and
whether
he
really
wanted
another
lawyer
or
just
wanted
to
add
a
lawyer
and
he
said
he
very
vacillated
around.
finally,
the
judge
gave
him
24
hours
to
see
if
he
could
find
himself
another
lawyer.
meanwhile,
the
jury
was
coming
in
and
going
out
but
none
of
these
proceedings
were
going
on
in
front
of
the
jury.
they
were
just
sitting
in
or
standing
around
the
courtroom
waiting.
mr.
george
t.
davis
they
were
not
appointed
lawyers.
they
had
been
retained
apparently
under
whatever
circumstances,
i
do
not
know,
but
they
were
not
court-appointed
lawyers.
now
about
the
second
day
of
the
discussions,
i
was
contacted
by
a
friend
of
this
man
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
not
at
all.
i
thought
i
could
come
to
it
quicker
this
way
but
i
have
two
propositions
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
one
question
of
law
is
whether
it
has
to
do
with
a
question
involving
present
or
rather
insanity
after
a
conviction,
after
a
conviction
and
a
sentence.
and
that
question
is
framed
in
our
--
in
our
--
as
our
--
in
our
brief
here
in
this
way.
may
the
life
of
an
insane
prisoner
under
sentence
of
death
be
taken
by
the
state
as
the
result
of
a
non-reviewable
ex
parte
determination
of
the
crucial
fact
of
sanity
made
by
a
single
executive
officer.
now,
this
is
the
question
that
was
before
this
court
in
the
phyle
case.
it's
exactly
the
same
question
and
the
circumstances
are
such
that
we
are
now
here
again
on
that
question.
there
is
a
second
question,
and
that
second
question
is
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
it
would
seem
to
be,
yes.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
they're
necessary,
they're
pertinent
to
the
second
question.
mr.
george
t.
davis
more
than
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
not
necessarily
to
the
first,
you're
quite
right.
now
with
reference
to
the
second
question
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
i
think
they
may
be
relevant.
mr.
george
t.
davis
they
may
be
relevant.
i
think
i'll
point
out
where
and
why
is
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
they'll
be
--
i
think
they
are
relevant
to
the
first
question
also
to
a
certain
extent.
mr.
george
t.
davis
the
second
question
is
whether
as
--
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
california
law
and
procedure
thereunder
whereby
this
petitioner
was
not
permitted
to
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
at
the
end
of
the
trial
of
his
case
in
the
california
superior
court
and
prior
to
judgment.
now
--
that
i
have
to
go
into
the
facts
in
order
to
indicate
how
that
question
arose.
when
i
came
into
the
case
on
the
second
or
third
day
and
after
three
or
four
days
of
discussion
back
and
forth,
i
was
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
this
man
as
his
counsel
in
the
trial
and
the
two
other
counsel
were
dismissed.
mr.
george
t.
davis
not
guilty
was
the
only
pleading
in
the
case
at
that
point.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
previous
to
that
point
he
could
have
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
in
which
event
under
california
law,
he
would
have
had
a
trial
on
the
not
guilty
plea
at
the
end
of
which
he
would
have
a
trial
on
his
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
if
found
guilty
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
george
t.
davis
he
just
pled
not
guilty.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
all
the
trial
would
be
on.
and
of
course
the
trial
would
only
be
on
the
plea
of
not
guilty
anyhow
except
for
the
fact
that
if
the
double
plea
had
been
entered
he
would
have
the
right
to
an
additional
trial
at
the
end
of
the
first
trial.
this
is
not
like
the
federal
procedure
where
all
matters
are
tried
in
one
trial.
now
the
first
--
the
reason
i
think
these
facts
become
somewhat
pertinent
is
because
on
the
very
first
day
that
i
was
brought
into
the
case
as
counsel,
i
told
the
trial
judge
--
and
it's
in
the
record,
that
i
thought
this
man
was
insane,
that
i
had
doubts
about
it
and
that
i
didn't
know
whether
i
had
or
was
representing
a
sane
client.
i
said
to
the
judge
that
i
did
--
also
didn't
know.
i
wanted
a
mistrial
and
i
moved
for
it
and
it
was
denied.
i
said
let's
start
anew,
it
was
denied.
i
said
then,
your
honor,
may
i
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
at
the
end
of
this
trial
so
that
he
may
have
some
hearing
on
this
issue.
the
judge
said
no,
you
may
enter
that
plea
now
if
you
wish.
you
may
now
enter
it.
i
said
i
can't
fairly
or
properly
enter
it
now
because
i
would
have
no
right
to
make
a
voir
dire
examination
of
this
jury
which
i
would
have
if
i
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well
it
may
either
be
tried
before
the
same
jury
or
before
another
jury.
it's
in
the
discretion
of
the
court.
i
--
i
said
to
the
judge
in
my
effort
to
try
to
find
a
way
out
of
this,
if
you
won't
give
me
a
mistrial
then
i
don't
want
to
plead
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity
the
first
day
i
come
in
to
this
trial
and
thereby
practically
convict
the
man
before
this
jury
because
of
the
implications
that
will
come
from
that
statement
or
with
that
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well
i
--
i
felt
that
it
would
have
to
be
and
the
judge
insisted
that
it
be
done
in
open
court.
the
judge
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
that
maybe
the
philosophy
but
the
practice
is
to
have
the
same
jury
tried
both
cases.
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
after
they
have
convicted
a
man
presumably
on
the
grounds
that
he
is
sane
then
they
have
to
try
him
on
the
question
whether
he's
innocent.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
the
theory
behind
it,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
with
the
wells
case
and
other
cases
now
the
practice
is
beginning
to
merge
so
that
we're
almost
getting
to
the
point
now
where
we
tried
the
sanity
question
in
the
first
case
only
we
just
don't
call
it
sanity.
we
call
it
mitigation
or
something
else.
now,
getting
back
to
this,
this
was
a
very,
very
--
an
impossible
dilemma
to
be
in.
i
--
and
i
explained
this
to
the
court
and
said
that
i
think
the
solution
to
it
is
very
simple,
just
let
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
be
entered
after
the
first
trial
is
over
and
before
the
jury
is
dismissed.
mr.
george
t.
davis
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense?
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
you
would
be
barred
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
apparently
the
california
law
as
it
is
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well
it
is
the
california
law
as
it
stands
now
and
the
way
the
statutes
are
interpreted
and
i
am
not
for
years,
that
this
was
an
unconstitutional
interpretation
and
application
of
these
statutes.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
because
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
denial
of
due
process
depending
on
facts
that
may
develop
such
as
the
very
fact
that
developed
in
this
case.
i
didn't
come
into
the
case,
i
was
appointed
by
the
court.
i
didn't
seek
to
come
into
this
case.
i
didn't
come
into
it
until
two
days
after
the
case
had
started.
i
didn't
know
that
there
was
any
doubt
about
this
man's
sanity
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
that
i
could've
raised
it
by
a
plea
previously.
it's
true
you
may
say
that
while
he
had
counsel
and
he's
bound
by
what
his
counsel
did
but
i
feel,
your
honor,
that
if
as
in
this
case
or
as
in
a
proper
extension
of
what
happened
in
this
case,
if
as
a
trial
proceeded
where
you
suddenly
realized
that
you
were
defending
a
man
who
was
insane
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed,
why
shouldn't
you
have
a
right
to
put
that
plea
in
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
if
that
developed
after
you
got
into
it?
excuse
me.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
that's
exactly
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
what
the
court
held
in
this
case.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
this
case.
there
was
a
hearing
in
front
of
the
court
after
the
finding
of
guilty
and
before
sentence.
mr.
george
t.
davis
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
oh,
but
your
honor
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
but
your
honor,
i
didn't
--
remember,
i
didn't
come
into
this
case
until
after
this
was
done.
i
didn't
come
into
this
case
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
until
after
the
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes,
the
judge
did
say
that.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
i
don't
think
that
i
was
in
fairness
and
in
respect
--
and
out
of
respect
and
care
for
the
rights
of
this
man
because
if
i
had
put
the
plea
in
at
that
time,
i
would've
then
been
deprived
of
what
i
think
is
another
very
fundamental
right.
when
you
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
previous
to
the
beginning
of
a
trial,
at
the
time
of
the
examination
of
the
jury
on
--
who
are
going
to
try
both
issues
presumably,
you
have
a
right
to
voir
dire
examine
jurors
both
as
to
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
also
with
reference
to
their
attitudes
about
the
insanity
plea.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
understand.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
but
your
honor,
i
will
say
dispositively
about
that
subject
as
it
developed
in
this
case.
the
judge
made
it
clear
that
a
plea
of
insanity
could
be
entered
before
the
trial
was
ended.
he
also
made
it
clear
that
there
would
be
no
further
voir
dire
examination
of
that
jury.
and
it
was
my
position
and
expectation
that
i
would
have
to
go
to
trial
then,
in
front
of
that
same
jury
on
a
plea
of
insanity
without
having
had
any
voir
dire
examination
or
any
right
to
interrogate
or
examine
those
jurors.
now
i
--
i
had
to
assume
that
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
law
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
because
that's
what
the
judge
said.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well
i've
--
i've
had
an
opinion,
if
i
may
say
it,
that
some
years
ago
when
this
question
did
come
up
about
the
double
pleas
and
it
was
sustained
as
constitutional,
that
maybe
in
the
interim
after
an
opportunity
to
look
at
it,
it
may
not
be
as
constitutional
as
it
was
thought
to
be
at
that
time.
and
i
think
the
time
has
come
for
a
reappraisal
in
this
case
on
these
facts
because
you
have
to
--
we
have
to
come
to
it
in
a
case
that
presents
the
facts.
this
case
on
these
facts
may
bring
us
to
the
--
or
may
bring
the
court,
may
i
respectfully
say,
to
a
reappraisal
of
the
due
process
phases
of
that.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
understand.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
i
will
go
right
to
the
first,
if
i
may.
mr.
george
t.
davis
it's
on
page
6,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
davis
in
the
--
oh
i
beg
your
pardon,
at
your
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
no,
i
have
--
i
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
use
--
i'm
speaking
of
my
brief.
i've
discussed
it
and
argued
it
in
the
opening
brief.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i'm
afraid
that
i
may
not
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
don't
know
whether
i
did
or
not.
i
don't
think
it
was.
mr.
george
t.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
if
it
isn't
there,
it
isn't
there,
your
honor.
i
thought
it
was
--
i
thought
it
had
been
raised
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
let
me
--
let
me
come
back
to
that
on
my
--
on
my
rebuttal.
that's
a
good
question
and
i
think
it
is
here.
i
think
it's
here.
now,
if
i
may
--
let
me
take
up
this
other
question
because
i
don't
want
to
consume
my
time
and
your
honor
has
properly
put
it
on
this
without
getting
to
the
other
very
basic
question.
this
question,
the
other
one,
and
the
real
question
in
a
sense,
is
the
question
that
was
before
this
court
in
the
phyle
case.
now,
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
with
reference
to
this
question
of
insanity
developing,
present
insanity
developing
in
connection
with
a
person
who
is
about
to
be
executed
or
who
has
been
sentenced
and
is
presumably
to
be
executed.
the
court
said
with
reference
to
that
question
in
the
phyle
case
that
it
was
a
serious
constitutional
question.
but
upon
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general,
and
i
believe
it
was
mr.
linn
at
the
time,
but
at
any
rate
upon
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
that
there
was
a
procedure
in
california
namely
by
mandamus
by
which
this
question,
the
constitutionality
of
that
question
could
be
tested,
the
court
said
that
the
issue
was
not
ripe
for
decision.
and
presumably
the
case
went
back
to
the
california
courts
on
the
theory
that
there
was
a
remedy,
there
was
a
way,
there
was
some
method
in
the
california
courts
by
which
some
form
of
judicial
hearing
or
some
form
at
least
of
administrative
hearing
could
be
guaranteed
to
a
person
who
raised
the
question
of
presently
existing
insanity.
now
that
was
the
situation
in
california
at
the
time
the
caritativo
case
was
first
begun
through
the
courts
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.
when
the
petition
for
mandamus
was
filed
in
the
caritativo
case
based
on
the
phyle
case,
the
california
courts
refused
to
issue
mandamus
and
said
in
effect
and
point
blank,
which
is
of
course
the
thing
that
puts
the
issue
before
this
court
in
almost
a
truly
legal
forum.
the
court
said
in
effect,
“there
is
no
remedy
by
mandamus.”
they
even
went
to
the
extent
in
the
--
in
their
opinion
of
saying
--
in
the
majority
opinion
of
saying
that
there
is
no
remedy
even
by
habeas
corpus
in
cases
such
of
this
--
as
this.
mr.
george
t.
davis
they
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
sir?
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
they
said
that
the
whole
thing
rested
on
the
warden.
that
it
was
entirely
within
the
scope
of
the
warden's
purview
so
to
speak
to
make
this
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
present
insanity
existed.
if
they
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
there's
no
requirement
of
a
hearing.
the
warden
is
not
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
yes.
mr.
george
t.
davis
no.
then
the
court
--
the
court
said
that
this
is
final.
this
is
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
mandamus.
mr.
george
t.
davis
it
cannot
be
tested
through
habeas
corpus
and
it
cannot
be
tested
by
any
court
in
any
judicial
manner.
now,
there
was
an
implication
in
the
statement
of
one
of
the
judges,
a
concurring
opinion
in
--
of
the
state
supreme
court
that
nevertheless
this
judge
didn't
want
to
go
along
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
didn't
think
there
might
be
some
remedy
in
habeas
corpus.
he
concurred.
he
didn't
dissent,
but
he
just
implied
that
he
thought
that
habeas
corpus
might
possibly
apply.
so
at
a
subsequent
time
a
petition
was
filed
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
order
to
be
positive
and
certain
that
there
was
--
that
the
question
was
resolved
the
way
it
appeared
to
be
resolved.
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
the
california
supreme
court
then
unequivocally
said
that
there
was
no
remedy
in
the
courts
that
this
california
statute,
which
provides
that
the
warden
shall
make
this
determination
was
exclusive,
so
to
speak,
that
it
provided
in
its
application
that
this
might
be
done
in
secret
or
it
might
be
done
in
any
other
manner
without
notice,
without
hearing,
without
anybody
having
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
or
be
present,
and
that
it
was
unreviewable
by
any
court
and
that
it
would
be
final
in
that
sense.
now
the
warden,
the
prison
authorities,
have
made
themselves
very
clear
on
the
subject.
they've
made
themselves
clear
to
the
extent
that
they
will
not
give
you
any
information
about
a
person
as
to
whom
you
allege
there
is
a
case
--
a
state
of
present
insanity.
they
have
taken
the
position
that
they
will
decide
that
question
within
themselves
in
the
prison.
they
will
make
their
own
decision.
they
will
not
allow,
upon
request,
they
will
not
allow
a
counsel
or
a
representative
of
an
allegedly
insane
person
to
bring
in
a
psychiatrist
to
make
an
examination.
they
will
not
allow
any
examination
of
their
records,
of
their
own
prison
records
with
reference
to
whatever
investigations
they
have
made.
they
have
taken
a
position
that
these
are
confidential
and
that
no
one
is
entitled
to
them
and
that
the
warden's
final
word
whether
it
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
otherwise,
without
any
possibility
of
review,
is
the
final
word.
now,
this
was
the
ruling
of
the
california
supreme
court
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
and
it
is
from
that
petition
that
we
came
to
this
court
in
order
--
and
ask
for
certiorari.
mr.
george
t.
davis
the
warden
had
said
that
he
did
consult
prison
psychiatrist
and
that
based
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
no,
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
disputed.
and
in
this
particular
case
there
was
even
a
--
a
letter
was
written
to
me
at
one
time
stating
substantially
that
the
man
was
a
schizoid
personality
and
that
he
had
delusions
and
hallucinations,
and
that
he
was
psychotic
or
neurotic
--
not
psychotic,
but
that
he
was
neurotic,
but
that
they
still
thought
that
he
was
not
insane.
and
when
i
asked
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
factual
material
upon
which
that
conclusion
was
based
i
was
informed
that
such
material
would
not
be
available
to
me,
that
it
was
confidential.
now
the
position
we
have
here
of
course
is
very
similar
as
i'm
--
as
--
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
to
the
situation
in
the
companion
case
that
comes
afterwards.
and
it
puts
us
in
this
very
strange
position
where
we
have
the
law
of
the
state
of
california
saying
definitely,
as
a
matter
of
law
and
in
conformity,
with
apparently
what
was
the
common
law
and
with
what
seems
to
be
the
accepted
standard
of
justice
in
this
kind
of
a
subject
that
an
insane
person
may
not
be
executed.
but
--
and
that
--
and
the
law
further
states
that
if
there
is
good
cause
appearing
why
--
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
present
insanity
that
the
warden
shall
mandatorily,
under
a
mandatory
statute,
do
certain
things.
but
we
find
ourselves
in
the
position
wherein
the
application
of
this
statute
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
there
is
no
way
open
to
a
petitioner
or
to
his
counsel
to
take
any
legal
steps
or
to
make
any
legal
moves
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
to
protect
the
situation
or
to
present
the
situation
legally
to
any
court
if
it
does
develop
that
there
is
a
question,
a
serious
question,
about
the
sanity
or
the
present
sanity
of
a
condemned
man.
now
it
is
stated
in
the
petition
and
we
have
--
we
have
pretty
much
followed
the
language
that
was
used
in
connection
with
the
phyle
case
because
this
court
seemed
to
go
into
that
subject
rather
carefully
in
the
phyle
case
and
although
it
didn't
make
a
decision,
it
didn't
make
the
decision
in
that
case
on
the
constitutional
questions
because
it
felt
that
the
decision
or
the
subject
matter
so
to
speak,
was
not
ripe
for
decision
at
that
time.
we
certainly
submit
to
the
court
that
on
this
particular
question
the
matter
is
now
ripe
for
decision.
and
we
feel
that
the
court
should
consider
it
and
make
its
decision.
now
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
other
time
i
have
to
mr.
linn
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
t.
davis
no.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
contending
that
there
was
any
bad
faith
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
--
or
that
--
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
--
i'd
like
to
put
it
in
this
form.
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
absence
of
a
judicial
review
is
one
point
that
i
have
in
mind
but
i'd
go
a
step
further
and
say
that
under
the
statute,
as
it
now
stands,
there
is
not
even
--
there
is
no
provision
even
for
an
administrative
hearing
where
anyone
representing
the
party
is
allowed
to
appear.
this
is
all
done
ex
parte.
and
i
feel
that
the
absence
of
either
administrative
type
of
hearing
or
judicial
hearing
certainly
is
a
deprivation
of
rights
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
i
--
i
no,
i
won't
abandon
it
but
i
--
may
i
explain
it
to
this
extent.
it
is
characterized
as
being
arbitrary
because
of
the
failure
to
allow
anyone
representing
the
petitioner
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
proceedings
or
to
appear
or
to
be
heard.
now
as
to
what
he
did
to
himself
within
the
hearing,
of
course,
i
have
no
knowledge
or
no
way
to
know
what
he
did.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i
--
i'm
afraid
i
would
have
to
say
that
it's
a
conclusion
because
i
know
--
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
arbitrary
or
whether
he
just
smoked
the
pipe
and
said,
“i'll
wait
five
minutes
and
claim
that
he's
sane.”
mr.
george
t.
davis
that
is
a
more
correct
statement
of
what
i'm
contending.
mr.
george
t.
davis
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes.
i
--
i
do
enjoy
and
appreciate
the
--
mr.
linn's
sense
of
humor
and
especially
on
these
cases.
he
is
sometimes
referred
to
at
home
as
guest
house
clearance
and
i
suppose
that
that's
--
comports
with
his
manner
of
handling
this
type
of
case.
now
mr.
linn
makes
a
very
interesting
plea
here
in
which
he
tells
you
how
psychiatrists
act
and
how
wardens
act.
i
could
make
quite
a
contrary
statement
about
the
subject.
i'm
not
going
to
impose
upon
your
time
to
do
it.
i
presume
the
court
is
just
as
aware
as
i
am
that
this
rather
coy
and
subtle
and
suave
approach
by
mr.
linn
on
the
basis
of
things
entirely
outside
of
the
record
have
really
no
bearing
on
this
situation.
mr.
george
t.
davis
well,
i
--
i
feel
that
his
statements
on
the
subject
of
what
prison
psychiatrists
do
are
at
least
subject
to
some
contrary
statement
on
my
side.
now,
we
have
felt
and
i
think
you're
going
to
find
out
when
you
hear
the
facts
as
distinguished
from
the
law
with
reference
to
the
next
case
that
mr.
linn's
discussion
about
what
happens
isn't
quite
what
happens.
now,
the
fact
to
the
matter
as
i
see
it
is
this.
it's
not
a
question
whether
people
have
a
right
to
do
something
if
they
want
to
do
it
and
such
as
the
warden's
attitude
or
actions
here,
well
whether
it's
a
situation
where
he
can
examine
if
he
wishes
to,
whether
he
can
let
you
come
in
with
a
psychiatrist
if
he
wishes
to,
the
question
is
do
we
have
a
right
to
it
or
not?
does
the
law
as
it
should
be
interpreted
and
should
be
applied
does
due
process
of
law
as
it
--
as
we
feel
it
should
be
interpreted
and
applied
in
this
case?
does
it
put
us
in
the
position
where
we
have
rights
rather
than
where
we
just
rely
on
the
good
wishes,
the
goodwill
or
the
whims
or
the
caprice
of
the
warden
in
a
particular
case
at
a
particular
time?
he
won't
let
dr.
diamond
in
but
if
he
feels
like
it
he'll
let
someone
else
in.
now
we
take
the
position
that
we
are
entitled
to
an
application
and
to
an
interpretation
of
the
law
that
clarifies
that
situation.
either
we
have
a
right
to
go
there
and
we
have
a
right
to
have
some
kind
of
a
hearing,
and
we
have
a
right
to
do
something
other
than
secrecy
and
ex
parte
procedure
or
we
don't.
now,
this
endless
argument
about
the
endless
petitions,
it's
been
made
many
times
that
if
you
don't
watch
out
you're
going
to
find
a
petition
here
sort
of
as
was
set
in
the
nobles
case.
petitions
will
continue
to
be
made
dependent
upon
the
fecundity
of
the
ideas
of
the
--
of
the
prisoners.
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
also
contained
in
the
nobles
case.
after
all,
petitions
for
certiorari
can
be
filed
just
about
as
fast
as
often
as
anybody
can
draw
up
a
piece
of
paper
and
file
them
but
they're
not
granted.
and
the
courts
have
a
right
and
there
is
a
place
and
a
way
where
these
endless
procedures
can
be
prevented
and
can
be
stopped,
and
it
is
not
a
fair
statement
of
this
problem
to
say
that
because
it
is
subject
of
possibility
of
abuse
that
abuse
must
necessarily
follow.
i
don't
think
that
that
will
necessarily
follow
and
i
don't
think
that
should
be
a
prevailing
matter
before
this
court.
i
don't
know
why
mr.
linn
went
into
this
discussion
about
the
last
night
of
filing
of
the
petition
for
mandamus.
but
as
long
as
he
tells
you
what
everybody
else
has
told
him,
i'd
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
since
he's
raised
that
question,
i
didn't
even
want
to
file
a
petition
for
mandamus.
i've
been
reluctant
because
i've
been
an
unpaid
pro-bono
public
counsel
all
through
in
this
case.
and
finally
on
the
last
night,
i
called
the
catholic
prison
chaplain
who
certainly
has
more
contact
with
these
people
than
the
warden
or
anybody
else
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
this
man
was
insane.
and
he
said
he
did.
and
i
couldn't
do
anything
but
file
that
petition
after
a
statement
like
that
even
though
it
was
an
hour
or
two
before
the
scheduled
time
of
execution.
now
my
position
before
the
court
is
this,
and
may
i
say
this
to
your
honor,
that
i
--
i
want
to
make
one
explanation.
i
was
looking
at
my
petition
and
i
must
say
that
i
have
filed
so
many
petitions.
i
had
just
filed
a
petition
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
which
i
raised
both
of
these
questions.
then
i
filed
this
petition
in
this
court
and
i
have
reached
the
point
where
i
was
just
about
hopeless
about
it.
i
did
not
put
that
question
in
the
petition
on
file.
but
when
i
suddenly
found
that
certiorari
had
been
granted,
i
went
ahead
and
argued
the
point
because
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
subject
matter
had
some
relevance
even
to
the
first
point.
and
i
--
i
must
admit
--
and
will
say
frankly
to
the
court
--
that
it
was
argued
but
it
is
not
properly
before
the
court
on
the
petition.
the
other
point,
however
is
and
i
certainly
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
way
that
mr.
linn
has
vacillated
in
a
sense
about
what
he
thinks
ought
to
be
done
in
the
previous
history
of
this
case
or
this
type
of
case
would
seem
to
indicate
that
in
order
to
set
this
subject
at
rest
there
ought
to
be
a
decision
on
the
fundamental
basic
legal
question
involved.
because
i
will
concede
and
i
don't
want
you,
mr.
justice
black
to
think
that
i
meant
anything
offensive
to
mr.
linn
by
my
remark.
i
want
to
concede
along
with
him,
that
if
this
is
not
set
at
rest
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
very
strange
and
perhaps
difficult
situation
may
develop
in
california
because
if
there
are
going
to
be
statements
made
or
if
the
court
is
going
to
send
it
back
again
on
the
theory
that
if
the
warden
wants
to
do
what
he
can
do
then
there
will
be
petitions
and
matters
before
the
warden
and
we
can
be
practically
assured
that
the
net
result
will
be
that
the
cases
will
be
back
up
here
again
in
several
years
from
now
because
obviously
it
is
not
the
intention
of
the
warden
or
any
of
the
public
authorities
in
california
to
grant
any
hearings
or
give
anybody
a
hearing
on
these
matters.
and
they
have
pretty
well
made
their
position
clear
in
the
--
in
the
papers
that
are
on
file
and
certainly
it
ought
to
be
clear
in
listening
to
mr.
clarence
linn
discuss
the
subject.
now,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
matter
of
rights,
not
a
matter
of
privilege
or
permission
and
we
ask
you
to
decide
it
on
that
basis.
mr.
george
t.
davis
thank
you.
