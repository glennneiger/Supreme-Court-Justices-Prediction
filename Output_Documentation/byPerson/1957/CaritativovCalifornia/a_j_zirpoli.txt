mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
case
of
william
francis
rupp,
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
to
review
the
denial
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
of
a
petition
filed
by
laura
(inaudible),
the
sister
of
the
prisoner
in
condemned
role
in
which
she
alleges
and
set
forth
--
sets
forth
that
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
a
defendant
now
under
death
sentence
is
insane.
and
she
proceeded
in
her
petition
to
set
forth
factual
allegations
supporting
this
conclusion.
the
warden
had
denied
--
had
refused
to
call
the
question
of
the
sanity
of
the
condemned
prisoner
to
the
attention
of
the
district
attorney
in
the
manner
required
by
section
3701
of
the
penal
code
of
california.
now,
before
reviewing
the
facts
in
the
law
pertinent
to
the
instant
case
with
the
kind
indulgence
of
this
honorable
court,
i
should
like
first
to
direct
some
preliminary
observations
to
a
question
asked
by
justice
felix
frankfurter,
in
order
that
thereby,
we
may
clarify
and
focus
as
sharply
as
possible
our
attention
on
the
specific
issue
before
the
court
at
this
time.
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
--
if
i
recall
his
question
correctly,
stated,
"does
this
record
permit
me
to
say
i
don't
now
have
to
decide
constitutionality
of
this
statute?"
i
respectfully
submit
at
the
outset
that
the
petitioner
does
not
now
necessarily
question
the
constitutionality
of
section
3701
of
the
penal
code
of
california.
hence,
i
would
say
in
response
to
the
question
of
justice
frankfurter
that
it
is
not
now
necessary
for
this
court
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
section
3701
as
a
statute.
i
say
it
does
--
it
is
--
does
not
now
necessarily
have
to
question
the
authority
or
the
propriety
of
having
the
warden
make
the
determination
of
the
sanity
of
the
condemned
prisoner.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
does
not
question
why
did
the
california
court
did
summarily
deny
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
where
the
facts
alleged
merely
show
a
suggested
insanity.
the
words
used
in
both
the
noble's
case
and
in
the
case
of
solesbee
versus
balkcom.
however,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
does
insist
that
the
california
courts
have
the
power
to
entertain
judicial
process
when
the
facts
alleged
show
a
clear
abuse
of
authority
on
the
part
of
the
warden.
this
power
closed
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
absolute
refusal
of
the
court
to
exercise
the
power
results
in
a
denial
of
due
process
and
because
of
these
observations
on
the
question
propounded
by
justice
felix
frankfurter,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
question
as
suggested
on
page
1
of
the
brief
by
the
respondent
which
reads,
"is
the
california
procedure,
which
provides
no
judicial
review
of
a
warden's
determination
of
a
condemned
prisoner
sanity
constitutional?"
this
question
in
my
opinion
is
not
the
proper
question
for
this
case,
and
while
i
set
forth
two
suggested
questions
in
--
in
my
brief
and
in
the
petition
of
writ
of
certiorari,
i
must
confess
that
on
further
consideration
of
this
case,
the
questions
should
be
even
more
pointed
and
become
even
more
precise
--
precise.
and
that
the
basic
question
here
is,
"does
the
refusal
of
the
california
courts
to
grant
a
review
of
the
warden's
ex
parte
determination
of
the
sanity
of
a
prisoner
under
sentence
of
execution,
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process
when
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
prisoner
is
insane."
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
no,
your
honor,
not
in
the
slightest.
no.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
no,
i
might
--
i
might
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
order
that
i
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
order
that
i
would
like
to
have
this
court
make
is
this.
that
we
have
before
us
a
petition
which
sets
forth
facts
14
paragraphs
at
least,
showing
that
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
prisoner
is
insane,
that
there
has
been
no
traverse
filed
in
the
court
below
or
any
efforts
or
a
pleading
or
many
kind
or
character.
that
because
of
that
circumstance,
we
must
accept
as
truth
every
allegation
contained
in
the
petition.
and
considering
the
petition
and
the
allegations
thereof,
we
find
that
it
can
--
in
all
propriety,
he
said
that
there
is
good
quality
brief
--
belief
that
this
prisoner
is
insane.
and
when
we
say
there
is
good
cause
to
believe
that
this
prisoner
is
insane,
we
say
good
--
good
cause
as
it
must
and
necessity
be
interpreted
by
law
and
not
necessarily
by
the
judgment
of
a
single
man
because
he
is
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
this
supreme
court
--
i
--
i
can't
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
supreme
court
of
california.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
oh,
yes.
well,
i
thought
your
honor
was
saying
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
--
that
this
court
here
had
said
that.
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
this
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
i
say
that
that
--
i
say
that
is
on
the
constitution
and
the
refusal
of
the
court
under
those
circumstances
to
review
the
case
is
what
brings
about
the
unconstitutionality.
this
is
the
statute
that's
unconstitutional.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
it
isn't
the
procedure
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes,
but
the
facts
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
i
--
i
would
like
very
much
for
your
honor
to
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
--
to
have
passed
upon
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
state
of
california,
but
i
don't
think
in
--
in
full
fairness
to
my
man
that
we
have
necessarily
to
require
this
court
to
go
that
far.
i
say
this
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
says
that
it's
not
unconstitutional,
to
deny
to
give
him
a
review.
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
for
the
moment
setting
aside
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
for
the
moment
saying
that
there
has
been
a
suspension.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes,
and
i
say
that
the
supreme
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that's
right.
and
i
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
wrong
when
it
doesn't
put
the
qualification
provided
he
does
not
act
arbitrary.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
limit
to
--
to
his
right.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that
he
has
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
i
say
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well
that
--
that
may
be
what
they
said
and
that's
why
we're
here.
and
because
i
had
before
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well
i
--
i
still
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well
yes,
your
honor.
i
still
respectfully
submit
and
i
recognize
that
i
have
not
done
in
at
all.
i
still
respectfully
submit,
despite
the
inadequacy
in
which
i
am
expressing.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that
this
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
it
is.
i
still
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
such.
there
can
be
violation
of
due
process
in
the
application
of
the
law
as
well
as
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that's
right.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
as
applied
in
this
case,
it
is.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
that
is
correct.
but
when
we
look
at
the
concurring
opinion
and
you
look
at
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
carter,
you'll
find
it
in
the
concurring
opinion.
justice
shaw
said,
"i
do
not
however
concur
in
any
possible
implication
that
an
insane
person
may
be
executed
or
the
right
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus
may
be
suspended
or
denied
absolutely."
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
he
expresses
the
opposite
view
and
the
view
in
the
sense
that
i
am
expressing
on
this
appeal.
now,
i
might
--
continuing
with
the
--
with
a
presentation
with
relation
to
the
case
that
your
honors
just
heard
and
this
case.
and
that
is
that
there
are
certain
differences
between
the
caritativo
case
and
this
case,
which
i
should
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
towards
to
avoid
the
danger
of
a
rationale
that
would
--
that
the
decision
which
might
be
rendered
in
the
caritativo
case
would
necessarily
be
conclusive
on
the
ruff
case.
and
the
difference
is,
i
respectfully
submit
are
three
in
number.
the
first
difference
is
the
difference
with
relation
to
the
petitions
themselves.
in
the
caritativo
petition,
there
are
two
paragraphs
which
are
in
effect
conclusions
of
law
if
they
relate
to
the
question
of
the
sanity
--
claimed
sanity
of
the
prisoner.
whereas
in
the
rupp
case,
there
are
14
paragraphs
relating
to
the
claimed
insanity
of
the
prisoner
which
show
a
history
of
mental
and
physical
disorder
of
the
condemned
man
from
the
day
of
his
birth
to
and
including
his
incarceration
and
condemned
row.
and
i
do
not
propose
to
go
into
all
of
those
facts
except
to
quote
if
i
might
from
this
including
paragraph
of
the
--
of
a
medical
doctor,
william
f.
gray,
who
served
on
the
staff
at
san
quentin
who
had
seen
rupp
at
the
time
of
his
admission
to
the
prison
and
who
had
visited
him
over
a
period
of
two
--
two
years
in
his
rounds
of
the
prison.
and
he
said,
"i
found
william
rupp
to
be
a
deeply
withdrawn
child-like
personality
who
mentally
might
be
best
be
termed
a
low-grade
moron."
i
do
not
believe
that
william
rupp
has
the
mental
capacity
to
understand
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
crime
or
his
punishment.
the
second
difference
is
the
fact
that
in
the
caritativo
case,
there
was
an
affidavit
on
file
from
the
warden
which
was
tantamount
to
a
return
to
order
to
show
cause.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
affidavit
on
file.
there
is
no
traverse
of
any
kind
for
character.
and
again,
i
repeat,
we
are
bound
by
the
phraseology
and
the
words
contained
in
the
petition
itself
and
the
truth
of
which
must
be
accepted
under
these
circumstances
if
i
correctly
interpret
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
he
had
a
trial
in
which
he
pleaded
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
both
cases
were
tried
before
the
same
jury.
the
question
of
the
denial
of
due
process
in
the
trial
itself
had
been
raised
in
previous
petitions
and
decided
adversely
by
the
appellate
court
and
certiorari
denied
by
this
court.
the
question
of
his
present
insanity
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
should
say
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandate
which
the
court
denied.
and
in
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
when
it
became
apparent
that
mandamus
would
not
lie
with
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
caratativo
versus
teets.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
there
--
but
there
--
but
there
are
--
there
history
from
the
time
of
trial
up
to
and
including
his
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
more
--
the
substantial
part
of
this
went
to
a
jury
at
the
trial.
that
is
correct.
that
is
everything
that's
contained
in
the
petition
and
where
the
historical
review
of
the
physical
and
mental
history
of
the
condemned
man,
went
into
the
trial.
this
and
the
events
which
pertained
to
the
subsequent
history
of
the
man
of
course
were
not
in
the
trial.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
actually,
stand
trial
itself?
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
not
that
i
recall
from
the
record.
the
--
the
case
had
been
tried
in
orange
county.
the
basic
question
which
was
raised
to
know
or
what
they
--
they
attempted
to
raise
--
there
was
no
question
of
forces
to
the
guilt
and
this
old
question
was
the
mental
capacity
of
the
defendant
to
formulate
the
requisite
intent
on
the
charge
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
while
attempting
to
commit
rape.
and
the
entire
proceeding
revolved
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
certain
evidence
offered
on
the
part
of
the
defense
was
admissible.
and
that
was
--
had
been
a
contention
made
that
because
this
was
his
sole
defense
and
because
of
the
complete
limitations
thereof,
he
had
been
denied
due
process
in
the
trial
itself.
all
of
those
questions
have
been
decided
adversely
to
the
petitioner
and
i,
of
course
respectfully
submit,
are
not
now
before
this
court.
and
the
basic
question
before
this
court
is,
"do
the
facts
in
my
opinion
show
--
show
that
this
man
--
that
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
presently
insane?"
if
the
facts
show
that
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
presently
insane?
"was
the
action
of
the
warden
arbitrary,
and
if
the
action
--
and
if
those
two
facts
are
established
in
the
fear
from
the
petition,
does
due
process
require
that
there
shall
be
a
judicial
review
of
such
finding
of
the
warden?"
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
oh,
no.
i
do
not
necessarily
submit
on
a
--
on
judicial
review
but
at
some
form
of
review
that
would
at
least
enable
the
full
assertion
of
the
claim
of
the
insane
person.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
it
--
it
could
be,
had
before
the
warden
and
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
no
such
opportunity
was
given
this
man
before
the
warden.
as
the
petitioner
request,
certain
requests
were
made
of
the
warden
and
they
were
denied.
and
there
is
no
showing
in
the
form
of
a
traverse
or
a
response
in
order
to
show
cause
in
this
case
on
the
part
of
the
warden
and
in
order
to
show
--
cause
issue
as
there
have
been
a
showing
there
on.
and
of
to
subsequently
developed
then
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
there
wasn't
adequate
opportunity
to
present
evidence
to
show
the
present
insanity
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
defendant
serving
this
sentence
and
awaiting
execution,
then
it
might
be
said
that
there's
a
basis
for
the
findings
of
the
warden
that
he
does
not
find
that
there
is
--
there
is
reason,
a
good
cause
--
good
reason
to
believe.
if
i
might
state,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
the
warden
shall
find
good
reason.
of
course,
i
recognize
he's
the
one
who
must
do
it
but
the
statute
says
that
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
and
the
warden
must
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
district
attorney.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
his
opinion
insane.
that's
right.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes,
it
does
make
a
defendant
upon
the
opinion
of
the
warden
but
let's
assume
that
--
that
a
warden
acts
for
the
moment,
and
i'll
take
the
actual
extreme
--
extreme
that
there
isn't
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world.
let's
say
everyone
but
the
warden
that
this
man
is
insane.
and
let's
say
that
the
warden
then
were
to
insist
on
his
position.
the
supreme
court
of
california
says,
"well,
it's
unfortunate
that
that
is
the
fact
and
it's
unfortunate
that
this
man
is
insane
and
it's
unfortunate
we
must
prove
it.
unfortunate
but
we
must
proceed
with
the
execution
of
a
known
insane
man."
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
you're
bound
by
it
unless
it's
unconstitutional,
i
will
agree,
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
it's
identical
with
--
on
the
basic
law,
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
but
except
for
one
thing
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
and
the
reason
i
pinpointed
that
out
is
that
--
if
--
if
a
petition
fails
to
state
facts
sufficient
on
its
face
to
warrant
the
granting
of
relief,
of
course
the
court
can
deny
it
for
that
reason
and
i
didn't
want
if
some
--
with
such
reason
where
(inaudible)
in
the
other
case.
i
didn't
want
that
reason
be
necessarily
to
find
over
and
--
and
encompass
william
francis
rupp.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
trying
to
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes,
i
know.
i'm
not
trying
to
make
that
assumption
your
honor.
i
just
--
i
want
to
make
sure
that
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
i'm
not
laxing
in
my
presentation
of
the
case
of
this
man.
now,
there
are
--
there
are
two
basic
arguments
that
the
attorney
general
has
made
and
i
might
pull
directly
from
his
brief.
he
says,
the
granting
of
reprieves
for
the
reason
that
a
condemned
inmate
has
become
insane
is
a
matter
of
grace
and
not
a
requirement
of
due
process.
now,
while
there
may
be
some
historical
basis
for
the
argument
that
there
were
is
some
relationship
between
executive
clemency
and
the
power
to
retrieve.
the
fact
remains
that
historically
and
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
as
best
as
i
can
determine
in
every
state
of
the
union,
the
execution
of
--
of
an
insane
person
is
deemed
contrary
to
all
humanitarian
and
moral
principles
and
violates
the
universal
sense
of
justice.
and
in
california,
in
recognition,
you
might
say,
this
basic
and
--
and
basic
principle
of
universal
justice,
in
the
california
recognition
of
it,
we
have
two
statutes.
we
have
section
1367
of
the
penal
code
which
says
a
person
cannot
be
tried
sentence
or
punished
for
a
public
offense
while
he's
insane
and
as
a
further
--
and
in
further
implementation
thereof,
we
find
3701
directs
to
warden
when
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
is
insane
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
district
attorney.
now,
this
statutory
provision
is
not
a
matter
of
grace,
but
it's
a
codification
in
the
sense
of
the
basic
precept
of
justice
to
which
i
have
previously
referred.
if
the
conduct
violates
due
process,
it
can't
be
a
matter
of
grace.
section
371
would
conform
--
would
conform
the
due
process
when
the
award
max
within
the
discretion
granted
to
him.
but
when
he
disobeys
the
law,
he
completely
refuses
to
adhere
to
the
direction,
a
mandatory
direction
to
use
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
the
filed
case
when
he
refuses
to
adhere
to
such
mandatory
direction
that
he
shall
call
the
prisoner
to
the
attention
of
the
district
attorney,
then
such
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
court
constitutes
a
denial
of
due
process
and
that
is
of
complete
failure
to
protect
the
prisoner
who's
about
to
be
executed.
the
district
attorney
goes
on
and
says,
"due
process
at
most
requires
that
the
power
to
grant
a
reprieve
to
a
condemned
inmate
who
has
become
insane
if
he
reposed
in
some
officer
tribunal."
he
then
says,
"due
process
does
not
require
a
jury
trial
or
other
adverse
--
adversary
hearing
to
the
determination
of
the
question.
now,
i
would
be
prepared
to
concede
both
of
those
statements
in
their
general
sense.
i
think
that
the
power
can
repose
in
some
officer
or
tribunal.
i
do
not
think
that
it's
necessary
that
there
be
a
jury
trial
or
adversary
proceeding
in
that
sense."
and
then
he
says,
"the
procedure
used
in
california
affords
due
process."
now,
if
the
last
call,
the
procedure
used
in
california
affords
due
process,
if
by
that,
he
means
the
procedure
proscribed
by
section
3701,
if
followed,
provides
due
process
of
law,
then
again,
i
would
be
in
the
court
ruling.
but
the
point
we
make,
the
procedure
proscribed
by
section
3701
was
not
followed
in
this
case.
and
hence,
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
he
did.
i
don't
mean
it
in
the
sense
that
he
didn't
physically
follow.
i
mean
it
in
the
sense
that
there
was
--
there
were
facts
to
show
a
good
reason
to
believe
that
he's
insane,
and
such
facts
being
in
existence
and
being
indirectly
or
not
indirectly
be
--
being
called
to
his
attention
as
we
had
indicated
that
we
have
requested
him
to
certify
this
case
to
the
district
attorney.
such
fact
is
being
called
to
his
attention.
in
that
degree,
there
is
a
failure
on
his
part
to
follow
the
mandate
and
directive,
and
there
is
the
good
reason.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that's
right.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
in
that
respect,
i
say
they
are
wrong
when
they
say
it's
not
subject
to
review
at
all
regardless
of
the
nature
of
proceedings
that
you
may
file
and
regardless
of
the
--
of
the
facts
which
you
may
allege.
when
the
california
court
goes
that
far,
then
i
say
the
california
court
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
place
is
--
yes,
but
if
there
is
no
opportunity
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
they
are
--
they
are,
but
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
--
as
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
but
even
though
they
are
a
manner
of
degree,
that
does
not
preclude
the
possibility
to
the
warden's
conduct
may
be
so
beyond
the
degree
of
the
normal
concept
of
society
that
he
may
proceed
even
to
that
degree.
i
don't
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes.
i
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
their
reasons
for
not
depositing
it
to
that
ultimate
in
the
warden,
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
to
that
ultimate
degree.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
i
say
the
due
process
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
--
clause
is
--
permits
him
and
i
would
like
to
say
and
i
still
would
like
to
insist
that
it
doesn't
have
to
permit
him
to
arbitrarily
make
it.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
i
--
i
would
like
to
definitely
insist
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes.
in
other
words,
may
i
--
may
i
read
what
would
be
the
conclusion
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
in
view
of
the
observations
made,
i
take
that
position
now,
definitely.
and
i
take
the
further
position
that
they
have
to
pass
upon
him
when
his
conduct
becomes
arbitrarily
--
arbitrary.
and
i
want
to
make
--
to
read
one
paragraph
from
solesbee
versus
balkcom
if
i
may.
the
court
and
practically,
the
concluding
paragraph
says,
"there
is
no
indication
that
either
the
governor
or
the
positions
who
acted
on
petitioner's
application
violated
the
humanitarian
policy
of
georgia
against
the
execution
of
the
insane."
we
hold
that
the
georgia
statute
has
applied,
it's
not
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
i
hold
that
3701
as
applied
in
this
case
is
a
denial
of
due
--
due
process
because
there
are
facts
alleged,
uncontradicted
facts
alleged
which
would
give
reason
to
believe
that
this
man
is
insane,
and
therefore,
he
is
about
to
violate
the
humanitarian
policy
of
california
against
the
execution
of
the
insane.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
i've
heard
it
frankly,
your
honor.
i
still
--
into
a
sense,
i
--
i
still
in
the
sense
don't
think
that
this
court
in
this
case
have
to
go
quite
that
far.
and
i
--
and
i
--
and
i'm
trying
to
present
the
avenues
to
this
court
so
that
the
court
will
consider
the
factual
situation
as
disclosed
by
the
petition
itself.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
no,
i
can't
go
there.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
i
can't
go
quite
that
far
because
if
i
were
to
say
it
doesn't
require
judicial
--
judicial
protection,
i
wouldn't
be
here
at
all.
i
couldn't
be
here
because
i'm
here
seeking
the
judicial
protection
which
i
feel
it
requires.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes,
that
i
say
and
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that's
right.
i
still
say
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
no,
i
say
but
it
cannot
be
done
by
the
judge
in
his
own
secrecy.
in
other
words,
he
cannot
set
himself
--
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
well,
i
don't
think
necessary
it
has
to
be
done
by
a
judge.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
if
--
if
the
elements
of
fairness
are
presented,
if
an
opportunity
to
present
the
adverse
claim
is
presented,
there
you
have
all
the
elements
of
fairness
which
might
not
make
it
all
necessary
through
a
judge.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
yes,
you
do.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
that's
right.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
court
would
determine
if
the
facts
presented
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
are
such
to
show
that
it
should
entertain
jurisdiction
and
determine.
i
shall
conclude
my
observations,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
i
have
few
more
moments.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
attorney
general
had
said
in
responsible
to
a
question
of
justice
brennan,
at
least
if
i
interpret
what
he
said
correctly.
he
said
that
if
there
had
been
an
assertion
of
a
--
of
a
violation
of
the
equal
protections
of
the
law's
clause
that
the
court
could
entertain
judicial
--
judicial
review.
well,
i
just
like
to
say
briefly
that
i
cannot
see
how
he
can
consistently
take
that
position,
and
at
the
same
time
take
the
position
that
there
can
be
no
judicial
review
if
the
question
involved
stood
on
another
constitutional
privilege
and
that
is
the
privilege
of
due
process.
and
there
was
one
other
comment
that
was
made
and
that's
the
fact
of
the
four-year
delay.
well,
i'm
not
here
by
way
of
apology,
but
the
factor
of
four-year
delay
would
require
a
--
a
detailed
statement
as
to
all
of
the
history
of
this
case
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
came
to
this
case
four
years
ago
at
the
appointment
of
the
district
court
under
circumstances
in
which
the
petitioner
and
the
petition
previously
filed
had
alleged
that
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
in
the
trial
court
itself.
but
there
had
not
been
an
exhaustion
of
the
state
remedies
as
a
consequence
of
which
and
because
of
appeals
that
the
petitioner
insisted
in
taking
in
which
i
would
not
participate,
at
least
as
far
as
certiorari
to
this
court
is
concerned.
the
case
ran
through
the
gauntlet
then
to
determine
the
fact
that
he
had
not
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
thereafter,
i
did
file
a
petition
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
for
the
purpose
of
determining
that
question
and
exhausting
the
state
remedies
if
it
became
necessary.
that
petition
was
denied,
certiorari
was
denied.
and
then
having
exhausted
my
state
remedies
pursuant
to
section
2255
of
title
28,
i
went
into
the
district
court
and
raised
the
question
of
the
due
process
of
law
insofar
as
the
trial
itself
is
concerned
and
that
case
then
went
through
the
usual
gauntlet
and
it
was
not
until
that
point
and
until
an
effort
to
have
the
governor
commute
the
sentence
of
the
prisoner
to
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole
that
i
came
into
court
and
sought
to
establish
the
present
sanity,
the
question
of
the
present
sanity
of
the
accused.
because
his
sanity
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offense
and
that
the
question
of
where
there's
a
denial
of
due
process
in
the
trial
itself
was
a
paramount
importance
because
it
went
to
the
very
innocence
or
guilt
of
the
accused
if
he
were
incapable
to
formulate
the
intended
--
if
that
were
a
defense,
the
denial
of
which
would
have
constituted
due
process
of
law.
hence,
that
is
the
history
of
this
case.
it's
an
unfortunate
gauntlet
that
one
must
go
through
in
these
circumstances
but
it's
unavoidable.
however,
regardless
of
justifiable
or
lack
of
justifiable
cause,
the
question
is
now
before
this
court.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
the
crime
was
committed
in
august
of
1952,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
i
beg
your
honors
pardon?
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
i
distinguish
the
solesbee
case
in
this
that
as
applied,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
here.
as
applied,
this
court
ruled
the
--
the
statute
of
georgia
was
not
unconstitutional
and
that's
the
basic
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
a.
j.
zirpoli
thank
you,
your
honor.
