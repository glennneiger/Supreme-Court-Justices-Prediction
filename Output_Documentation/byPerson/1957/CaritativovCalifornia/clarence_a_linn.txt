mr.
clarence
a.
linn
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
first
point
raised
by
mr.
davis,
we'll
find
a
little
--
a
little
basis
in
fact
or
no
basis
in
fact
in
this
record.
our
little
basis
of
fact
in
the
record
of
the
trial
i
believe
that
your
honors
have
in
the
records
of
this
court,
the
complete
record
of
the
trial
of
caritativo
which
came
up
here
on
certiorari
in
another
proceeding.
if
necessary,
we
can
call
your
attention
to
it.
this
is
sufficient
answer
to
the
points.
the
record
will
show
that
what
happened
when
mr.
davis
was
subjected
into
the
case
one
way
or
another
was
that
he
--
either
i
--
i
think
this
man
is
crazy
and
i
--
i
want
to
plead
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
and
the
judge,
“why
don't
you
do
it
right
now?”
and
he
said,
“no,
i
want
a
mistrial
first.
part
of
the
case
had
been
in.
the
jury
had
been
selected.
i
want
a
mistrial.
i
won't
--
i
don't
want
to
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
now.
i
want
a
mistrial
now.”
these
--
these
points
were
not
passed
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
the
original
caritativo
case.
they
weren't
raised
by
counsel
on
a
certiorari
aimed
at
that
original
case.
under
brown
versus
allen
they've
been
abandoned.
they
were
abandoned
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
they
were
abandoned
here.
and
they're
still
abandoned
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
--
our
brief.
one
point
i
want
to
clear
up
about
an
independent
psychiatrist
coming
into
the
jail
to
examined
the
man.
they
asked
for
one
particular
independent
psychiatrist
they
named
him.
and
the
warden
said,
“no,
that
psychiatrist
cannot
come
here.”
we
can
well
imagine
that
there
may
be
a
no
particular
reason
for
that
psychiatrist
not
being
admitted.
i
think
i
am
the
reason
because
he
was
admitted
on
another
occasion.
some
things
transpired
that
were
not
in
regulation
as
far
as
prison
regulations
are
concerned
and
he
couldn't
come
in.
i
don't
know
what
the
warden
would
have
done
about
another
psychiatrist.
i
told
him
that
that
was
his
business
and
that
all
the
psychiatrists
that
he
wanted
to
or
he
could
keep
them
out.
in
accordance
with
his
security
regulations
with
the
safety
of
prisoners
in
considering
the
fact
that
he
might
have
a
string
of
psychiatrists
coming
through
making
studies,
as
what's
done
in
this
case,
studies
of
condemned
men
for
papers,
for
learned
treatises
of
things
at
that
time
which
the
prisoners
themselves
didn't
enjoy
at
the
time
that
it
happened.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
that
has
never
happened.
there's
never
been
an
adversary
proceeding
before
the
warden.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
and
i
don't
want
anybody
to
start
one
now.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i'm
perfectly
frank
about
it.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
they
have
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
made
a
suggestion
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
before
in
this
court
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
i
got
the
problem
back,
that
i'm
here
because
i
--
i'd
like
to
have
this
--
let's
say
this,
the
warden,
the
wardens
of
the
state
prison
in
california
have
been
very
humane
men.
if
a
prisoner
is
ill
or
sick
and
anyone
here
arrested
wants
the
consolation
of
having
that
man
examined,
they
can
do
it.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
if
i
had
a
preference
i'd
prefer
you
decide
it
on
the
statute.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
under
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
dr.
diamond
didn't
get
in.
he
was
a
--
he
was
the
psychiatrist
sent.
other
psychiatrists
have
got
in
and
on
another
occasion,
dr.
diamond
got
in.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
no.
that's
a
matter
in
the
warden's
bosom
and
in
my
bosom
as
to
why
he
didn't
get
in.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
don't
do
it,
judge.
do
it
the
other
way.[laughter]
i
fell
in
--
i
don't
say
i
fell
into
a
trap
but
i
made
a
statement
in
response
in
the
phyle
case
to
a
similar
question.
i
answered
it.
and
the
court
went
further
than
i
thought
my
answer
required
it
to
go.
i
went
back
to
california
and
they
went
further
than
this
court,
went
where
i
went
and
then
they've
got
tired
of
it
and
they
threw
the
whole
mandamus
thing
out.
and
they
used
to
call
me
mandamus
linn
and
now
they
say
"you're
ex-mandamus
linn"
in
the
elevators
of
the
state
building.[laughs]
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes
sir.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
know.but
being
a
modest
man
i
came
back
to
california,
the
chief
justice
of
california
stopped
in
the
elevator
and
he
says,
“linn,
who
declares
the
law
in
california?”
i
said,
“see
phyle
versus
duffy.”
and
we
both
parted
and
that
point.
where
you
said
that
the
chief
--
the
attorney
general
--
to
which
--
which
is
correct,
but
i'd
like
to
assume
a
case
where
the
warden
said,
“i
am
satisfied
with
my
own
psychiatrist
and
i
don't
want
any
more
of
them
in
here.”
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
he
can
do
that
if
he
wants
to.
as
to
that
prison,
as
i'd
say
it's
within
the
bosom
and
the
conscience
of
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
i
would
like
it
decided
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
that
final.
wardens
make
their
mistakes
and
their
mistakes
if
they're
not
reviewable
they're
not
mistakes
then,
i
guess,
i
don't
know.
now,
the
--
the
facts
in
this
case
--
the
facts
in
this
case
were
--
before
the
supreme
court
of
california
were
not
only
the
petition
filed
by
mr.
davis
for
habeas
corpus
which
by
the
way
was
denied
without
opinion,
but
there
was
also
immediately
preceding
it
a
petition
for
mandamus
which
the
court
went
into
the
facts
fully,
and
there
is
a
record
there,
and
that
record
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
which
it
denied.
so
what
i
say
is
a
matter
within
the
judicial
knowledge
of
this
court.
it
showed
that
for
over
six
months.
mr.
davis
have
been
coming
and
going
from
the
prison
indicating
that
the
man
was
insane,
if
he
wanted
to
call
us
in
dr.
diamond
in.
six
months
before
the
date
of
execution
the
warden
told
mr.
davis,
“i
am
going
to
rely
upon
my
psychiatrist
and
i'm
not
going
to
let
dr.
diamond
in.”
the
day
before
the
execution,
mr.
davis
filed
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
that
standard
operational
procedure
these
days
and
a
stay
was
granted
and
habeas
corpus
was
denied
and
it
came
up
--
it
came
up
here
in
the
--
but
on
the
--
on
the
mandamus
proceeding.
i
do
--
did
as
i
always
do
in
these
cases,
i
am
not
content
to
rest
upon
presumptions.
i
went
into
court,
the
appellate
court
and
moved
to
dismiss
the
mandamus
proceeding
on
the
ground
that
it
was
frivolous
and
interposed
solely
for
the
purposes
of
delay.
and
i
set
out
all
of
the
facts,
the
facts
are
--
are
appearing
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
on
the
mandamus
proceeding,
they
are
printed
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
warden
had
been
advised
on
five
separate
occasions
by
his
psychiatrist
that
this
man
was
not
insane.
and
if
you'll
read
those
reports
that
he
sets
out
you
will
see
that
psychiatric
--
psychiatric
observation
is
prevalent
on
what
we
call
death
row
in
san
quentin.
they're
the
staff
of
psychiatrists
aside
from
the
medical
officer
in
charge
who
was
admiral
wilkins
who
used
to
be
in
charge
of
the
fester
down
here.
he
is
--
he's
in
charge
of
all
of
the
medical
work.
he
has
a
staff
of
psychiatrists
under
him.
he
examined
the
man,
the
psychiatrist
examined
him.
they
said
he
was
not
insane.
the
warden
acted
on
that.
he
said
he
did
not
need
any
further
information.
he
relied
upon
his
prison
force.
now
the
california
statute
covers
up
with
consideration.
it's
not
anything
novel.
it
goes
way
back
into
the
english
common
law,
the
halsbury's
laws
of
england
which
we
have
cited,
show
that
in
england
from
ancient
time,
a
practice
similar
to
this
was
filed.
the
sheriffs,
the
judge
on
the
circuit
and
down
into
modern
times,
the
home
office
makes
an
investigation
which
is
not
reviewable,
which
is
ex
parte.
they
examined
the
man
through
a
psychiatrist.
the
home
office
is
advised
and
kept
advised
and
that's
parallel
in
california.
the
warden
examines
these
men.
he
examines
them
from
time
to
time.
he
says
he
sees
them
himself
once
a
week
on
the
row.
the
psychiatrists
visit
them
at
least
20
days
before
execution,
60
days
after
they
come
in.
there's
a
continuum
of
movement
of
psychiatrists
in
and
out
of
the
row
examining
these
men.
they
make
their
reports
in
writing
to
the
warden.
the
warden
has
the
report
and
goes
and
talk
to
them.
that's
the
california
system
in
practice.
it
was
the
british
system.
it
is
the
system
in
most
of
the
states
of
this
union.
now,
why
it
should
it
be
in
the
warden?
because
the
warden
is
the
last
man
who
sees
this
condemned
prisoner.
he
walks
down
the
aisle
with
him.
he
is
the
man
who
must
decide
and
the
man
who
was
on-the-spot
that
makes
the
decision
to
have
judicial
review
or
any
kind
of
review
with
what
we
know
what
mental
illnesses,
the
psychiatrists
tell
us,
i'm
fearful
they
may
be
right.
i
may
be
sane
one
day
and
insane
another
day.
regain
my
insanity
then
become
insane
again.
and
--
and
if
the
contention
asked
for
is
the
proper
contention,
well
then
it
means
today's
adjudication
on
review
goes
in
the
waste
paper
basket
tomorrow
as
useless
because
i
may
lose
my
sanity.
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
in
california,
we
have
certain
safeguards
at
execution.
a
new
date
of
execution
has
to
be
set
not
less
than
20,
no
more
than
60
days
from
the
day
the
judge
sets
the
date
which
is
that
on.
there'll
be
a
two-month
interval
each
time
the
man
can
get
crazy
or
even
crazier.
and
a
new
examination
made,
a
new
review,
and
so
on
out
in
the
negative.
that
is
the
reason
why
this
common
law
proposition
is
drawn
up.
now
you
say
the
lack
of
due
process,
i
know
that's
a
matter
close
to
your
hearts
and
in
particular
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
be
very
close
to
the
heart
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
continuing
my
research
up
to
the
last
minute
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
what?
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
we
have
some
of
the
best
lawyers
on
death
row
who
claimed
they're
insane
now
and
that
are
filing
petitions
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
what?
now,
we
tell
him
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
the
due
process
to
show
that
it
worked
up
to
the
last
minute,
i
got
this
during
the
last
half
of
the
luncheon
recess.
this
phrase
due
process
formulates
a
concept
less
rigid
and
more
fluid
than
those
envisioned
in
their
specific
--
in
any
other
specific
or
particular
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights.
this
is
a
fluid
thing,
this
due
process.
some
--
it's
not
new
with
our
bill
of
rights,
it
was
a
magna
carta
and
there
it
took
the
term
law
of
the
land.
it's
the
law
of
the
land.
and
i
don't
mean
any
new
law
that
comes
in
that
may
abrogate
some
right
but
if
the
law
of
the
land
that
have
stood
anciently
from
time
immemorial
is
the
thing
that
is
followed,
that
is
the
law
of
the
land.
from
earliest
english
common
law
right
straight
down
to
the
criminal
lunatics
act
now
enforced
in
england,
the
present
laws
in
this
country,
that's
the
law
of
yesterday
and
the
law
of
today,
the
law
of
tomorrow
as
projected
by
the
american
law
institute
is
almost
identical
with
this
except
they
give
this
power
to
the
warden
--
to
the
governor.
now,
governors
in
california
by
inference
--
inferentially
he
has
this
right
because
i
can
again
let
you
in
on
a
state
secret.
the
governor
gets
a
report
of
all
of
these
matters
periodically.
a
report
from
all
the
offices
involved
from
this
offense
from
the
very
beginning
down
to
the
moment
he
gets
the
report,
a
few
days
before
execution
or
a
month
before
so
he
can
study
it.
in
practice,
every
safeguard
that
the
most
meticulous
student
of
due
process
would
want
is
here.
every
particular
of
the
law
of
the
land
is
observed
in
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
i
don't
know
the
average
number.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
there
are
24
there
now
and
it's
been
fairly
constant.
as
i
say
they
come
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
come
--
come
and
go.
in
the
last
10
years,
your
honors
may
be
interested,
the
warden
have,
including
the
phyle
case,
on
three
occasions
certified
men
who
in
their
reason,
who
in
their
belief
were
insane
and
sent
them
to
the
superior
court.
and
in
one
case
--
one
case
the
jury
found
him
insane,
he's
still
in
the
mental
hospital.
another
case
the
jury
found
them
sane.
and
then
the
phyle
case,
they
went
to
the
mental
--
mental
hospital
and
they
frankly
told
the
people
that
he
had
--
that's
about
our
psychiatrist,
how
they
lean
over
backwards,
phyle
had
told
them
at
the
mental
hospital
that
he
had
fooled
them
at
the
state
prison.
and
then
they
asked,
"why?
what
did
you
do
that
for?”
phyle
who
thought
he
was
out
said,
“well,
wouldn't
you
if
you're
wearing
effects?”
they
certified
him
back
under
an
improper
certification
as
cured
because
there's
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
certifying
back
as
feigning.
i'll
rest
at
this
point.
