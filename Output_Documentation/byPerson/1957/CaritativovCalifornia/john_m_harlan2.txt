justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
just
looking
at
your
petition
for
certiorari.
where
do
you
raise
that
second
question
that
you're
talking
about?

justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
looking
at
page
two
questions
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
only
question
i
see
is
the
one
that
--
it's
all
the
first
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
didn't
raise
it
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
did
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
isn't
here,
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
with
the
main
question
that
we've
got
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
in
fact
the
warden
did
consult
psychiatrist
before
he
refused
to
bring
a
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
not
--
that's
not
disputed.
you
--
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
make
any
contention
that
the
warden
did
not
act
in
good
faith?
that
he
didn't
act
as
he
was
required
to
act
under
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
simply
arguing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
general
question
at
the
absence
of
judicial
review
no
matter
what
the
facts
are
in
which
the
warden
acted
violates
the
process
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
allege
that
as
a
conclusion
of
law
and
not
an
allegation
of
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
why
dr.
diamond
didn't
get
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we're
bound
by
that
on
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
unless
it's
unconstitutional.
so,
the
base
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
basic
question
in
this
case,
although
you
put
it
differently
is
identical
with
the
other
cases.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
are
they?
do
you
know
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
somewhat
off
to
a
different
line?
is
there
any
charge
in
this
case
that
the
statute
was
discriminatorily
applied
by
the
warden?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
--
as
against
this
petition.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
but
there
is
no
claim
here
that
this
man
--
this
prisoner
was
treated
differently
by
the
warden
from
what
other
people
has
been
treated
in
terms
of
the
standards
or
motive
under
what
--
