mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
deportation
case.
the
petitioner,
frank
bonetti,
was
born
in
france
of
italian
parentage.
in
1923,
when
he
was
15
years
old,
he
entered
to
the
united
states
and
then
was
admitted
for
permanent
residence
as
a
quota
immigrant.
in
the
depression
year
of
1932
in
los
angeles,
he
joined
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
and
sometime
during
1936,
he
dropped
out
of
the
communist
party.
he
understood
that
communism
meant
the
public
ownership
of
the
principal
means
of
production.
and
he
did
not
believe
that
the
communist
party
stood
for
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
it
is
interesting
that
in
both
1932
when
bonetti
joined
the
communist
party
and
1936
when
he
left
the
communist
party,
the
presidential
ticket
in
california,
in
those
election
years,
included
candidates
on
the
communist
party
ticket.
some
months
after
bonetti
left
the
communist
party,
on
june
28,
1937,
he
left
the
united
states
and
went
to
spain
to
fight
on
the
side
of
the
spanish
republic
in
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade.
he
did
so
as
he
testified
because
he
felt
that
franco,
in
the
franco
rebellion,
was
an
instrument
of
mussolini
and
hitler
and
he
felt
that
the
rome-berlin
axis
were
not
stopped
in
this
particular
aggression
in
spain,
they
would
persist
in
aggression
until
the
a
world
war
would
start.
bonetti
was
in
active
combat
in
spain,
was
wounded
and
lost
a
foot.
late
in
september
of
1938,
he
returned
to
the
united
states
with
a
visa
and
was
stopped
(inaudible).
he
was
given
a
hearing
before
a
board
of
special
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not,
he
should
be
admitted.
at
this
hearing,
he
testified
fully
to
his
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
between
1932
and
1936
and
he
testified
that
he
had
fought
in
spain
on
the
side
of
the
spanish
republic.
the
board
of
special
inquiry
ordered
him
excluded.
that
was
appealed
and
that
decision
by
the
board
of
special
inquiry
was
reversed
by
the
--
in
washington,
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
so
that
on
october
8,
1938,
for
the
second
time,
but
that
he
was
admitted
for
permanent
residence,
under
the
new
quota
of
for
that
year,
as
a
quota
immigrant
and
as
a
new
resident.
since
that
day,
of
october
8,
1938,
when
he
was
readmitted,
he
has
resided
in
the
united
states,
in
california.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
could've
been
excluded
in
1938
for
just
about
any
reason
that
the
immigration
authorities
wanted
to
exclude
him.
he
could
not
have
been
--
there
was
no
provision
of
law
in
1938
which
excluded
persons
who
had
previous
--
who
had
before
been
the
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct.
now,
he
has
resided
in
the
united
states
since
his
second
entry
in
october
1938.
in
the
summer
of
1939,
he
did
leave
the
country
for
a
one-day
trip
to
mexico
and
returned
the
same
day
or
the
next
day.
he
has
not
belonged
to
the
communist
party
since
he
left
it
in
1936,
so
the
--
he
has
not
belonged
to
the
communist
party
at
any
time
since
he
came
back
to
the
united
states
and
for
some
time
before
that.
in
1942,
bonetti
married
a
native
born
american
citizen,
to
whom
he
is
still
married
and
he
became
the
stepfather
of
her
two
children.
in
1940,
bonetti
obtained
his
first
citizenship
papers
and
in
may
of
1943,
he
filed
a
petition
for
naturalization.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
interviewed
bonetti
in
1944
and
1946,
about
his
citizenship
application.
in
those
interviews
he
testified
to
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
the
period
mentioned
and
to
have
been
fought
in
spain.
his
application
was
not
further
processed,
and
it
wasn't
passed,
and
he
just
never
became
a
citizen.
on
september
23rd,
1950,
14
years
after
bonetti
left
that
party,
the
congress
enacted
over
the
president's
veto,
the
internal
security
act.
also
known
as
the
mccarran
act,
section
22
of
that
act,
"provided
for
the
first
time,
for
the
expulsion
of
any
alien
who
was
at
that
time
was
entering
the
united
states
or
has
been
at
anytime
thereafter,
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states."
a
year
or
so
later
in
october
of
1951,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
instituted
deportation
proceedings
under
this
provision
against
bonetti
and
he
was
ordered
deported
under
that
provision.
in
the
deportation
proceeding,
the
sole
evidence
of
his
past
membership
in
the
communist
party,
which
was
the
ground
on
which
he
was
deported,
consisted
of
bonetti's
own
admission,
namely,
the
testimony
that
he
gave
before
the
board
of
special
inquiry
at
his
exclusion
hearing
in
1938,
the
statement
that
he
made
on
his
alien
registration
form
which
asked
the
question
what
organizations
had
he
ever
belonged
to.
the
statements
he
made
to
officials
of
the
immigration
in
--
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
when
they
interviewed
him
in
1944
and
1946
on
his
application
for
naturalization
and
the
statement
he
had
made
to
an
immigration
and
natural
--
naturalization
service
investigator.
after
bonetti
had
exhausted
his
administrative
remedy,
he
filed
suit
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
declaratory
judgment
and
to
enjoin
the
deportation,
the
district
court
gave
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
government.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
statute
under
which
petitioner
was
ordered
deported,
that
is
the
internal
security
act,
as
well
as
the
current
immigration
and
nationality
act,
which
the
court
below
mistakenly
could
apply,
but
which
technically
does
not
apply,
but
we
make
no
point
to
that
because
obviously,
both
acts
should
have
to
be
interpreted
the
same.
but
both
statutes
provide
for
the
expulsion
of
any
alien
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
or
after
entry.
neither
statute
provides
for
expulsion
of
an
alien
merely
on
account
of
communist
party
membership
before
entry.
in
this
case,
the
alien
made
three
entries,
in
1923,
1938
and
1939,
respectively.
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
after
his
first
entry.
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
after
or
at
the
time
of,
either
of
his
last
two
entries.
so
the
precise
question
of
statutory
construction,
which
is
involved
here,
is
which
of
petitioner's
three
entries
is
included
in
the
statutory
phrase
which
expels
aliens
for
communist
party
membership,
"after
entering
the
united
states."
now,
we
believe
that
the
statute
refers
only
to
communist
party
membership
after
the
last
of
several
entries
and
if
we
are
right,
then
the
petitioner
is
obviously
not
deportable
under
the
statute.
but
before
turning
to
the
affirmative
reasons
in
favor
of
this
interpretation,
i
want
to
deal
first
with
the
grounds
on
which
the
court
below
held
that
after
entry
or
after
entering
in
the
statute,
means
after
any
of
several
entries
or
after
any
(inaudible).
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
the
word
"entry"
is
defined
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
to
mean
subject
to
limitations
that
don't
apply
here,
"any
coming
of
an
alien
into
the
united
states
from
a
foreign
place."
this
definition
corresponds
to
and
was
derived
from
the
case
definition
which
had
evolved
prior
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
the
court
below
said,
â€œwell,
since
an
entry
is
any
coming,
a
statute
which
expels
for
a
membership
after
entry
means
membership
after
any
entry."
now,
this
is
plainly
a
non
sequitur.
the
statutory
definition
of
entry
merely
describes
what
kind
of
an
arrival
constitutes
an
entry.
the
phrase,
"any
coming"
is
used
in
the
section
qualitatively,
as
it
were
to
mean
a
coming
of
any
kind
subject
to
certain
specified
exceptions.
for
example,
it
means
the
coming
for
permanent
residents
or
as
a
visitor,
or
as
a
seaman,
or
in
transit,
or
as
stow
away.
the
exclusions
from
the
definition
are
also
qualitative.
for
example,
an
entry
doesn't
include
a
coming
preceded
an
involuntary
departure,
nor
does
it
include
a
coming
which
consist
of
a
passage
by
sea
from
one
american
port
to
another,
although
exceptions
being
--
having
been
first
developed
by
cases
in
this
court.
now,
it's
simply
a
distortion
of
language
to
treat
a
definition
of
what
kind
of
conduct,
what
kind
of
coming
constitutes
an
entry
as
--
is
positive
of
which
particular
coming
of
several
comings,
is
referred
to
by
other
sections
of
the
act.
the
fact
that
a
--
an
entry
is
any
kind
of
coming
just
does
not
mean
that
every
statutory
reference
to
entry
means
any
entry.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
--
well,
the
word,
"coming"
is
in
the
statutory
definition
which
in
turn
is
derived
from
--
mr.
joseph
forer
the
statutory
definition?
mr.
joseph
forer
on
page
4
of
my
brief.
and
i've
been
referring
to
that
in
explaining
why
the
definition
is
a
qualitative
one
as
to
the
kind
of
coming.
mr.
joseph
forer
it
goes
back
to
cases
in
--
you
mean
of
the
definition
of
entry?
mr.
joseph
forer
it
--
it
goes
back
to
decisions
in
this
court
such
as
lewis
against
frick
and
following
that
the
volpe
and
claussen
cases.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
that's
what
i
said.
the
--
the
statutory
reference
is
derived
from
and
based
on
language
used
by
this
court
repeatedly.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
this
--
the
immigration
nationality
act
is
the
first
time
that
congress
defined
the
phrase
in
so
many
words.
up
to
then
the
phrase
was
defined
by
this
court.
now
--
mr.
joseph
forer
they
did.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
my
point
and
that's
what
i'm
coming
to.
the
case
definition
was
spelled
out
in
litigation
which
centered
about
the
question
of
what
kind
of
arrival
constitutes
an
entry.
it
did
--
did
not
center
about
the
question
presented
here
which
is
--
which
of
several
entries
is
critical
for
determining
status.
and
this
includes
the
volpe
and
claussen
cases
on
which
the
government
relies.
in
the
cases
in
this
court,
which
developed
the
meaning
of
the
term,
"entry",
it
was
always
assumed
that
the
last
entry
was
the
critical
entry
in
determining
status
and
the
question
which
was
always
argued
and
considered
was
whether
or
not,
a
second
coming
was
by
its
nature,
an
entry.
for
example,
the
original
problem
was
an
assertion
that
when
an
alien
who
has
resided
in
this
country
left
the
country
without
giving
up
his
domicile,
and
tending
to
come
back,
stayed
out
for
a
brief
period
and
then
returned.
and
it
was
argued
that
his
return
was
not
a
coming
because
--
it
was
not
an
entry,
because
entry
meant
coming
in
for
a
permanent
stay.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
they
didn't
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
am
saying
the
opposite.
i'm
saying
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
when
--
mr.
joseph
forer
the
decisions
of
this
court
said
that
any
coming
into
the
united
states
from
a
foreign
court
is
an
entry
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
a
first
coming
is
an
entry,
a
return
is
an
entry.
a
third
coming
is
an
entry.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
forer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct.
is
an
entry.
mr.
joseph
forer
but,
none
of
the
decisions
said
that
in
construing
a
statute
expelling
for
conduct
after
entry,
none
of
the
decisions
concerned
themselves
whether
the
words,
"after
entry"
referred
to
after
the
first
entry
or
to
the
last
entry.
they
all
assumed
that
meant
after
the
last
entry.
now,
we're
not
--
the
question
here
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
isn't
the
meaning
of
the
word,
"entry".
the
question
here
is
the
meaning
of
the
word,
"after
entry".
this
man
made
reentries
by
any
definition,
by
the
statutory
definition
and
by
the
case
definition.
but
the
statute
says
"refers
the
membership
after
entry
and
that
therefore,
the
question
is,
which
entry
does
it
refer
to
and
the
only
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
court
below
oversimplified
the
matter
by
thinking
that
it
could
discover
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
"after
entry",
merely
by
discovering
the
meaning
of
the
word,
"entry".
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is
the
meaning
of,
after
entry.
mr.
joseph
forer
no
it
did
have
a
you
--
your
honor,
you
did
misunderstand
what
i
said.
mr.
joseph
forer
it
did
have
--
i
said
it
had
a
qualitative
content
in
both
cases.
it
was
the
definition
of
entry
by
this
court
was
never
intended
to
distinguish
which
of
several
entries
was
the
critical
entry,
that's
what
i
thought.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct
and
it
doesn't
tell
us
which
entry
is
referred
to
when
the
statute
says
after
entry.
that
seems
to
me
that
the
plain
logic
and
the
only
reason
--
mr.
joseph
forer
because
i
didn't
say,
entry
doesn't
mean
when
you
come
in
again.
i
said,
after
entry.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
word,
"entry"
means
any
coming
in.
i
don't
care
whether
it's
first,
second
or
tenth,
but
the
question
here
which
is
the
question
that
the
court
below
missed
is
that
the
question
is
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
"after
entry"
and
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
entry.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
if
you
look
on
page
2
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
of
my
brief.
as
at
the
--
page
2,
the
--
the
very
last
section,
section
4
(a),
"any
alien
who
was
at
the
time
of
entering
the
united
states
or
has
been
at
anytime
thereafter."
and
the
question
is,
thereafter,
meaning
thereafter
entering
and
the
question
is
whether
after
entering,
refers
to
--
includes
his
first
entry
or
whether
it's
limited
as
i
say
to
his
last
entry.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
i
still
say
the
question
is
what
does
after
entering
mean
and
not
what
does
entering
mean.
the
court
took
the
definition
of
entering
and
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem
of
what
is
meant
by
after
entering,
when
you
have
entered
several
times.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
not
abandoning
in
my
argument
--
your
honor,
i
think,
we're
just
using
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
forer
(voice
overlap)
but
using
different
--
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
now,
i
--
i
want
to
get
on
to
the
affirmative
reasons
why
we
think
that
after
entering
in
the
statute,
refers
to
following
the
last
entry
and
only
the
last
entry.
first
of
all,
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
general
scheme
of
deportation
legislation.
it
is
a
general
feature
of
the
immigration
statute
that
--
and
this
particularly
true
of
the
deportation
statutes
referring
to
the
expulsion
of
political
radicals.
it's
a
general
scheme
of
these
statutes
that
once
an
immigrant
has
satisfied
the
admission
requirements,
he
is
not
thereafter
expelled
for
pre-entry
conduct
or
pre-entry
characteristics.
as
a
general
rule,
when
new
causes
for
expulsion
were
enacted
specially
for
radicals,
they
were
given
retroactive
effect
only
to
the
time
of
entry
or
the
period
after
entry.
this
represents
the
policy
not
to
upset
a
governmental
determination
of
the
alien
suitability
on
the
count
of
pre-entry
conduct,
which
did
not
disqualify
them
under
the
law
existing
at
the
time
of
entering.
it
recognizes
that
once
the
government
has
adjudicated
the
alien's
suitability,
it
would
be
a
breach
of
good
faith
if
after
the
alien
has
rooted
himself
in
this
country.
the
determination
of
suitability
is
changed
because
of
conduct
which
preceded
the
determination.
but
it
is
also
established
that
the
governmental
determination
of
suitability
is
made
with
each
entry
made
by
an
alien.
a
resident
alien
who
leaves
the
country
even
for
only
a
day
is
under
the
theory
of
the
immigration
laws,
a
newcomer
on
his
return,
so
these
two
principles
therefore,
operate
together.
first,
a
governmental
determination
of
suitability
protects
the
alien
against
expulsion
for
pre-entry
conduct.
second
on
each
entry,
there
is
made
a
governmental
determination
of
suitability
as
if
the
alien
were
a
newcomer.
it
follows
that
the
latest
governmental
determination
of
suitability
that
is
the
last
entry
provides
--
protects
the
alien
against
expulsion
for
conduct
which
preceded
that,
namely
the
last
entry.
now
normally,
these
principles
operate
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
alien.
for
example,
the
alien
maybe
expelled
for
committing
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
within
five
years
after
entry.
under
the
principle
that
a
returning
alien
is
a
newcomer,
this
five
year
probationary
period
starts
afresh
everytime
the
alien
steps
across
the
boarder
and
back.
but
there
is
no
reason
for
applying
the
theory
that
the
reentering
alien
is
a
newcomer
whenever
it
makes
the
alien
verso
and
discarding
it
in
the
more
unusual
case
like
here
in
which
it
makes
him
better
off.
this
principle
that
it
is
the
latest
entry
which
is
critical
is
--
manifested
in
the
text
of
section
241
(a)
which
is
the
deportation
section
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
subdivision
6
to
that
section
provides
for
expelling
persons
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party
after
entry.
but
subdivision
1
of
that
section
expels
aliens
who
were
excludable
at
the
time
of
their
entry,
including
persons
who
are
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry
if
they
entered
without
a
valid
immigration
visa.
and
subdivision
2
expels
aliens
who
entered
without
inspection.
now,
it
is
impossible
to
contend
and
i
am
sure
that
the
immigration
service
would
not
contend
that
an
alien
who
is
lawfully
admitted
on
a
proper
visa
and
after
inspection
is
expellable
because
on
some
earlier
occasion,
he
had
stole
it
into
the
country
and
then
left
on
his
own
volition.
if
that
were
the
case,
a
privilege
of
voluntary
departure
which
maybe
extended
to
illegal
entrance
who
have
been
ordered
deported,
in
order
to
allow
them
to
reenter
lawfully,
would
be
of
no
or
little
of
value.
so
it's
clear
and
i
don't
think
that
the
immigration
service
could
contest
it
that
subsection
(1)
of
the
deportation
section,
when
it
says
that
"aliens
shall
be
expelled
if
they
were
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry,"
means
excludable
at
the
time
of
last
entry.
and
subsection
(2),
when
it
says
that
"an
alien
is
expellable
if
he
entered
without
inspection,"
means
he
is
expellable
if
he
last
entered
without
inspection.
it
should
follow
that
subsection
(6)
when
it
says,
"an
entry
is
expellable
--
an
alien
is
expellable
for
communist
party
membership
after
entry,"
means
after
last
entry.
moreover,
there
is
one
subsection,
subsection
(13)
of
this
deportation
section
in
which
congress,
for
reasons
of
its
own,
chose
to
depart
from
the
statutory
scheme
that
is
the
last
entry
which
counts.
and
here
congress
expressly
used
the
words,
"any
entry".
so
under
one
occasion
in
which
congress
meant
any
of
several
entries
to
count
and
to
be
critical
rather
than
just
the
last
entry,
it
was
able
to
and
did
expressly
say
any
entry.
mr.
joseph
forer
there
is
nothing
that
either
side
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
seems
to
me,
can
cite
in
the
history
of
the
act,
of
any
real
relevance.
now,
at
the
very
least,
the
statute
is
ambiguous
and
it
is
an
accepted
principle
of
construction
often
announced
by
this
court
that
deportation
laws,
because
of
their
harshness,
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
alien.
also,
we
believe
that
this
construction
avoids
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
is
being
unconstitutionally
applied.
it
was
only
with
great
misgivings
that
this
court
sustained
the
validity
of
the
statute
expelling
aliens
for
past
communist
party
membership.
this
case
contains
all
the
dubious
features
of
the
typical
case
under
the
statute
and
then
adds
others
of
its
own.
here,
as
in
the
preceding
cases,
an
alien
is
being
banished
under
a
statute
enacted
years
after
the
cause.
and
what
was
this
cause?
the
peaceable
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
of
association
and
political
advocacy,
in
these
cases
and
the
others,
it
is
hard
to
see.
i
think
it
is
impossible
to
see
any
rational
connection
between
the
legislation
and
any
of
the
powers
delegated
to
congress.
but
here
we
also
have
something
more.
we
have
here
a
breach
of
governmental
good
faith
because
that's
what
it
is
to
expel
an
alien
for
a
cause
which
she
divulged
on
seeking
entry
and
which
was
held
not
to
exclude
him.
this
man
came
to
our
shores
20
years
ago,
crippled
by
having
fought
and
risked
his
life
in
an
antifascist
war.
he
disclosed
to
the
government
his
former
connection
of
the
communist
party,
a
connection
which
arose
from
his
idealism
and
doesn't
fit
some
stereotyped
conspiracy.
the
government
decided
that
he
was
fit
to
reside
in
this
country.
that
decision
shaped
his
life.
he
took
an
american
spouse.
he
worked
here,
thereby,
contributing
to
our
society.
he
fixed
his
roots
here.
he
permanently
estranged
himself
from
the
country
of
his
origin.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
has
made
an
application
for
discretionary
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
--
the
--
a
board
of
immigration
appeals
rejected
it
because
the
record
was
in
the
court.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
no,
that's
impossible.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
would
be
the
last
entry,
but
it
wouldn't
get
rid
of
a
cause
for
expulsion.
mr.
joseph
forer
now,
let
me
--
let
me
answer,
that
question,
justice
whittaker.
mr.
joseph
forer
under
the
immigration
laws,
if
an
alien
is
under
some
expellable
cause,
which
could
--
and
that
expellable
cause
could
be
past
communist
party
membership
as
well
as
present
membership.
mr.
joseph
forer
if
he
is
under
some
expellable
cause
under
the
law
then
existing,
he
cannot
get
rid
of
it
by
stepping
across
the
boarder,
because
once
he
steps
across
the
boarders,
that
same
cause
which
made
him
expellable,
prevents
him
from
returning.
it
makes
him
excludable
and
if
he
comes
back
anyway,
as
--
because
of
negligent
inspection
or
lack
of
inspection
or
because
he
doesn't
make
a
full
disclosure,
if
he
comes
back
anyway,
he
is
then
deportable
because
he
entered
at
the
time
of
his
last
entry
in
violation
of
the
exclusion
laws.
so
that
you
cannot,
by
stepping
across
the
border
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
at
that
--
at
that
time,
when
he
stepped
across
the
border,
the
cause
for
expulsion
did
not
exist.
mr.
joseph
forer
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
cannot
get
rid
of
a
presently
existing
cause
for
expulsion
by
stepping
across
the
border,
which
is
the
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
joseph
forer
no
--
no,
your
honor,
in
volpe
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
i
--
i'm
not
arguing
that
entries.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
in
volpe,
the
court
said
that
both
entries
--
his
first
entry
and
the
second
entry
was
an
entry
and
they
said
that
a
crime
committed
within
five
years
before
the
last
entry
satisfies
the
statute.
so
the
actual
holding
read
the
statute
as
if
it
read
last
entry,
although
they
said
that
the
prior
entry
was
also
an
entry.
i
truly
admit
that
all
three
entries
made
here
by
bonetti
were
entries,
but
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem
of
which
entry
congress
was
referring
to
when
they
used
the
words,
"having
been
a
membership
in
the
communist
party,
after
entering
the
united
states."
mr.
joseph
forer
it
--
it
doesn't
say
after
any
entry.
there's
no
more
reason
to
read
the
word
"any
in",
than
to
read
the
word,
"last
in".
and
as
i
tried
to
show
--
if
you
look
at
the
current
deportation
section,
you
can't
make
any
sense
at
all
or
can't
reconcile
yourself
the
practice
with
regard
to
aliens
who
came
in
without
inspection
or
illegal
entrance.
if
you
mean
that
an
--
an
alien
can
never
come
back
with
a
visa
without
being
expellable
for
a
prior
entry.
and
--
it
had
--
it
simply
is
ambiguous
and
therefore
the
rule
of
lenity
of
construction
is
involved.
thank
you.
