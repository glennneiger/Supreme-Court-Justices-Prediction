ask,
you
would

if
the
immigration
authorities
violates
the
law
and
they

him
to
come
back
the
second
time,
knowing
(inaudible)
that
he
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
did
have
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
an
introductory
because
he
went
through
the
same
kind
of
examination
that
he
would
have
and
he
never
been
in
the
country
before?
justice
hugo
l.

he
had
no
right
to
get
here
at
that
time
acceptable
of
his
being

justice

black
that
doesn't
solve,
does
it,
at
anytime,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem
we
have
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
you're
not
assuming
that
yourself
in
your
argument,
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore
--
you
therefore
know
that
it's
the
entry
--
entry
in
the
first
instance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
by
reading.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
say
so
long
as
--
as
to
the
first
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
think
there's
a
difference,
however,
i
--
i
don't
know,
but
i
wanted
to
(inaudible)
as
a
man
who
comes
here,
goes
back,
gives
up
any
idea
of
being
considered
on
living
based
on
you,
then
applies
on
the
new
(inaudible)
and
goes
through
new
proceedings
and
he's
admitted,
how
can
you
say
there's
no
reason
that
perfectly
the
acts
of
this
congress
has
meaning,
that
it's
that
entry
that
counts.
because
what
they
wanted
to
see,
that
no
man
(inaudible)
becomes
a
member
of
this
communist
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
assume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
assume
was
it
not,
that
they
wanted
despite
of
the
fact
that
people
went
over
(inaudible)
maybe
10
years,
maybe
had
been
only
a
day,
or
week.
it
come
back
in
10
years,
went
through
all
the
process
and
all
the
efforts
and
yet
they
meant
that
they
could
be
put
out
even
though
they
--
when
they
came
in
told
everything
about
it.
they
came
back
on
the
congress
(inaudible)
they
were
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
that?
i
wonder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
i
don't
understand
that
you
say
it's
(inaudible)
suppose
a
man
has
come
in
(inaudible)
three
days
and
went
back,
lived
that
10
years
and
then
he
went
through
all
the
process
in
the
american
consulate
and
all
that.
finally,
they
gave
him
that
is
--
he's
saying
he
came
back
told
--
wrote
the
consul
and
people
over
here,
came
in
and
said
where
he
had
been,
that
--
that's
more
than
a
paper,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
(inaudible)
one
perspective
was
only
those
who
did
that
after
entering,
this
act
applies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
depends
on
which
--
depends
on
which
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
(inaudible)
this
act,
they
--
as
they
came
out.
suppose
he
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
during
the
same
year
before
he
came
in
the
second
time
(inaudible)
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
europe,
constant
loyal
(inaudible)
he
came
in
and
they
let
him
would
he
then
be
covered
by
this
act,
if
he
did
not
become
a
member
of
the
--
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
thereafter,
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
under
any
provision,
does
the
law
now,
as
it
(inaudible)
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
reason
(inaudible)
does
it
authorize
the
deportation
of
aliens
who
came
here
and
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party
at
that
time.
he
didn't
become
so
actually,
but
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
in
europe.
