suppose
--
suppose
the
petitioner
had
not
returned
to
this
country
until
after
the
1952
act
was
in
effect
and
he
had
his
administrative
hearings
and
was
admitted
as
he
was
--
as
he
was
here,
would
you
say
that
after
admitting
him,
after
1952,
that
the
government
could
turn
right
around
and
--
and
deport
him,
before
he
has
made
--
where
he
has
made
the
full
and
fair
disclosure
of
--
of
his
past
(voice

--
chief

earl
warren
is
that
right?
