mr.
roger
d.
fisher
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
plunging
in
to
the
detailed
arguments
as
to
how
the
statute
should
be
construed,
i'd
like
to
try
and
put
the
petitioner's
position
in
the
broad
perspective
of
--
cancel
legislation
which
congress
has
adopted.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
request
for
suspension
for
deportation
was
denied
without
prejudice
to
reapply
later,
if
all
the
physical
documents
were
not
in
the
hands
of
the
immigration
service
when
he
applied
and
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
their
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
immigration
--
my
--
my
experience
with
immigration
service
would
indicate
they
are.
that
there
will
be
an
elaborate
file
giving
all
the
information's
thereby
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
they
are
not
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
their
--
if
i
withdrawn
from
the
court
below,
the
admitted
party
doesn't
name
him
as
part
of
the
record
up
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
i'll
find
out.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
at
the
time,
he
asked
for
suspension
of
deportation,
the
documents
had
been
turned
over,
i
understand,
to
the
court
at
its
request,
and
it
was
denied
without
prejudice
to
his
(inaudible)
against
for
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
the
--
not
as
far
as
i
know.
the
physical
absence
of
the
material
do
not
know
when
they're
going
to
get
it
(voice

--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'll
--
i'll
look
to
it
and
find
out
if
the
court
would
like
on
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
my
understanding
that
it
was
not
denied
for
that
reason
but
it's
on
a
--
on
a
comment
--
telephone
comment
(inaudible)
on
service.
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
help
--
look
into
what
the
court
would
like.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
he
would
--
yes.
i'm
not
sure
there
wouldn't
be
other
problems
in
the
statute
to
attempt
--
it
cannot,
but
i
think
the
case
would
be.
i
--
i
wouldn't
--
i'd
make
a
commitment
on
that,
but
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
might
effect
the
status
in
some
other
way.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
statute
is
harsh
and
it's
for
the
government
and
the
court
to
conclude
the
statute.
the
--
there
are
four
statutes
involved
here.
there
is
the
1918
act,
which
congress
first
made
deportable
aliens
who
had
after
entry
become
members
of
organizations
advocating
the
violent
overthrow
of
this
government.
at
the
basic
act
those
persons
who
had
after
entry
become
members
of
such
organizations.
in
1940,
the
statute
was
amended
to
make
it
apply
to
persons
who
have
become
but
no
longer
were
members
of
subversive
organizations.
in
1950,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
was
named
in
the
statute
as
a
party
of
which
former
membership
were
the
grounds
for
deportation.
and
then
in
1952,
the
immigration
nationality
act
would
(inaudible)
definitions
were
adopted.
this
proceeding
is
governed
by
the
1950
statute
of
legislation,
in
effect,
at
that
time.
the
basic
operative
language
as
to
going
back
and
getting
ex-members,
however,
was
that
putting
the
act
in
1940.
petitioner's
position
in
substance
says
that
in
1940,
when
congress
was
reaching
back
to
make
deportable
ex-members
of
subversive
organizations,
organizations
advocating
to
overthrow
by
force
and
violence,
that
at
that
time,
all
ex-members
who
had
since
leaving
the
party,
decided
continuously
in
this
country,
were
to
be
deported.
all
ex-members
who
at
some
time
seem
since
(inaudible)
party
had
taken
a
trip
and
left
the
country
and
come
back,
were
not
to
be
deported.
we
can
--
you
can
take
the
ex-members
of
subversive
organizations
and
put
them
in
the
two
classes.
those
who
since
--
leaving
the
party,
one
of
these
organizations
but
not
the
communist
party
by
name
at
that
time
as
organizations
advocating
violent
overthrow,
take
ex-members
who
had
left
the
organization
and
resided
continuously
here,
petitioner
concedes
all
those
persons
must
be
deported
under
the
legislation.
aliens
who
had
left
the
party
years
before,
but
who
at
some
point
had
taken
the
trip
or
had
left
the
country
for
good
and
come
back
and
again,
this
--
this
category
of
aliens
with
an
additional
foreign
connection,
were
to
be
not
deported.
now,
this
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
every
other
provision
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
laws
in
which
in
every
case,
the
person
who
continues
--
continuously
resides
in
the
united
states
and
aliens
who
continuously
reside
here
is
preferred
over
the
alien
who
has
left
the
country
and
returned,
who
has
had
traveled.
who
was
deported
from
the
country
and
come
back
in.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
they
did
not.
at
the
time
in
1938
of
his
entry,
the
exclusion
provisions
only
applied
to
current
members
of
such
organization.
of
--
of
organization
which
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
so
the
issue
with
1938
was
did
he
then
--
or
was
he
then
a
member
of
an
organization
advocating
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government
and
there
was
no
mistake
made.
he
was
properly
admissible
under
the
law
--
existing
in
1938.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
on
the
question,
i
believe,
of
his
then
present
membership
and
then
present
beliefs,
which
were
relevant
under
the
then
statute.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
any
alien
returning
to
the
united
states,
having
left
the
united
states,
everytime
he
--
he
is
--
he
loses
every
benefit
he
had
before,
except
only
his
quota
status.
he
does
not
have
to
wait
on
the
quota
anymore.
in
this
case,
he
came
in
under
a
new
quota,
so
he'd
--
he
abandoned
that
prior
right.but
whether
that
was
forced
on
him
or
whether
he
just
simplified
on
a
new
quota,
because
there
was
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right
he
came
in
--
he
came
in
oppressed
at
that
time
on
this
--
on
the
paper
application
he
made.
in
construing
the
statute,
the
--
mr.
forer
suggested
it's
as
easy
to
put
in
the
word,
"last
entry"
as
it
is
the
word,
"any".
i
suggest
there
is
no
need
to
insert
any
word
in
the
statute
on
its
face,
petitioner
here
is
deportable.
section
4
(a)
printed
on
page
2
of
petitioners
brief,
"any
alien
who
was
at
that
time
of
entering
the
united
states
or
has
been
at
anytime,
thereafter."
mr.
forer
and
petitioner
must
agree
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
that
he
was
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
that
--
he
entered
the
united
states
--
petitioner
here,
entered
the
united
states
in
1923.
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
entered
the
united
states
in
1923
and
it
is
not
disputed
the
he
entered
the
united
states
in
1923.
it
is
not
disputed
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
thereafter.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
there
is
no
reference
any
of
which
in
the
statute,
this
--
he,
in
asking
the
question,
he
has
assumed
his
answers.
in
asking,
the
question
is
which
entry
he
has
assumed
the
statute
refers
to
a
particular
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
i'm
saying
it
assumes
any
entry.
i'm
saying
if
i
can't
find
that
he
entered
the
united
states,
i
find
an
entry
in
the
united
states,
a
find
that
thereafter,
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
is
by
--
he
was
an
alien
in
the
--
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
therefore,
entry
meant
entry.
and
that
he
--
any
alien
who,
at
that
time
of
entering
the
united
states.
mr.
forer
(inaudible)
entered
the
united
states
in
1923.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
the
district
came
in
on
1923.
he
came
in
at
1938
and
1939,
but
he
also
came
in
1923.
a
person
is
deportable,
who
after
entry,
has
been
at
anytime
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
time
of
entering
--
entering
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
several
times.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
at
--
at
the
time
of
an
act
known
as
entering,
at
which
this
might
be
any,
but
the
--
the
--
it's
the
time
of
entering
or
the
time
of
an
entry,
or
after
entry
be
--
but
i'd
--
i
think
that
the
statute
on
its
face
read
literally
as
against
the
petitioner.
the
--
i'd
like
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
is
an
alien
in
the
united
states
who
after
entering
the
untied
states
became
the
member
of
the
communist
party.
that
--
but
i
--
i
the
--
the
issue
is
far
more
--
i
think
the
issue
must
to
be
resolved
in
terms
of
what
congress
intended
in
the
other
legislative
materials
bearing
on
it,
which
petitioner
says
are
not
illuminating
and
which
he
totally
ignores.
the
--
i
might
also
point
out
the
time
of
his
--
the
problem
of
mr.
justice
whittaker
mentioned,
the
time
--
the
1950
legislation,
there
were
two
other
grounds
for
deportation
under
the
1940
act
then
in
effect,
which
had
multiple
acts."
an
alien
who
at
anytime
after
entry,
shall
have
on
more
that
one
occasion,
knowingly
aided
and
assisted
another
alien
from
entering
the
united
states,
on
more
than
one
occasion."
now,
reading
the
statute
as
petitioner
would
have
us
read
it,
that
alien
once
he's
got
one
these
occasions
to
his
discredit,
he
can
go
into
canada
and
come
back
in.
a
single
such
incident
is
not
a
grounds
for
exclusion.
he
wipes
that
one
off,
comes
back
in
and
he
can
then
go
on,
if
he
gets
the
other
one.
then
he
can
go
--
go
outside
the
border
and
come
back
in,
because
this
single
one
after
entry
is
not
a
ground
for
deportation
or
not
a
ground
for
exclusion.
the
same
is
true
when
--
of
the
then
legislation
and
the
present
legislation
as
any
alien
who
shall
have
been
convicted
more
than
once
of
violating
the
provisions
of
title
1
of
the
alien
registration
act.
here
again,
are
two
convictions
under
the
meaning
given
to
the
after
entry
by
petitioner,
after
last
entry.
once
an
alien
has
one
such
conviction,
he
can
take
a
trip
and
come
back
in.
i
might
say
a
single
such
conviction
is
not
a
ground
for
exclusion
under
the
legislation.
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
think
the
government
would
be
required
to.
it
would've
been
illegal
for
him
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
would've
been
illegal
for
him
to
enter
the
united
states
under
the
1952
law
as
a
former
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
under
the
legislation
as
drafted,
an
alien
who
enters
and
who
is
excludable
at
the
time
of
his
entry
as
such,
then
would
--
he
must
be
deported
thereafter
found
to
be,
so
that
if
he
had
made
the
same
statements
here,
it
would
been
an
error
to
admit.
we
do
not
have
the
case
of
whether,
the
administrative
decisions,
making
a
mistake,
combined
the
government
thereafter
from
deporting.
we
have
the
case
here,
i
might
say
there
are
two
alien,
both
of
them
were
ex-members.
one
of
whom
always
stayed
in
this
country.
there
was
no
question
raised
about
his
right
to
resign
here.
the
law
unquestionably
requires
a
deportation
as
an
ex-member.
another
alien
who
--
an
ex-member
went
to
spain,
came
back.
no,
there's
no
impropriety
in
going.
no
impropriety
in
coming
back.
once
he's
here,
he
is
--
certainly,
we
submit,
no
better
off
for
having
been
legally
admitted
the
second
time,
than
the
alien
who
continuously
resided
in
this
country.
now,
whether
congress
intended
aliens
who
took
a
trip,
went
abroad
and
reformed
to
--
intended
to
give
them
a
different
treatment
i
think
is
clear
right
from
the
beginning.
in
the
1918
act
to
which
the
provisions
are
printed
in
the
supplemental
memorandum
made
available
for
the
court,
given
the
text
to
some
of
this
law,
that's
on
page
3.
the
two
line
--
two
sentences
were
put
in
there,
the
bottom
sentence
on
the
page
3
indicating
the
provisions
on
this
section
shall
be
applicable
to
the
class
of
aliens
mentioned
in
this
act,
irrespective
to
the
time
of
their
entry
in
the
united
states,
has
been
carried
forward
continuously
showing
it
is
meant
to
apply
to
entries
and
long
time
back.
but
the
section
3
of
the
1918
act
appearing
on
page
4
of
our
supplemental
memorandum,
"suppose
that
any
alien
who
having
been
deported
so
thereafter
returned,
shall
deemed
guilty
of
a
felony
and
deported
again."
and
there
was
some
debate
on
that.
mr.
(inaudible)
thought
this
was
pretty
rough.
this
was
very
severe.
he
spoke
of
the
alien
who
had
some
really
and
sincerely
reformed
having
left
the
country
and
wanted
to
come
back.
they
asked
at
the
end
of
his
speech,
is
there
anything
that
permit
him
to
come
back
and
of
the
country
under
existing
law
under
this
proposed
law.
mr.
burnett
i
think
not
and
i
do
not
think
we
should
adopt
anything
that
would,
because
it
would
open
the
door
to
too
many
cases
of
pretended
reaffirmation.
now,
this
was
dealing
with
persons
who
were
actually
been
deported,
but
it
does
indicate
the
total
was
that
the
fact
person
left
the
country
and
sincerely
reformed
and
wanted
to
come
in
on
a
fresh
start
the
proposal
mr.
burnett
sponsored
of
the
then
bill,
thinking
in
behalf
of
it,
opposed
the
suggestion
that
he
be
allowed
any
reaffirmation.
now,
turning
to
--
and
between
1918
and
1940,
there
are
three
cases
decided
by
this
court,
which
i
think
are
particularly
significant,
i'll
discuss
here
in
--
in
connection
with
the
--
the
history
of
this
legislation.
first
of
these,
in
1929
is,
claussen
against
day,
which
is
--
where
the
question
a
--
an
alien
entered
in
1912
and
reentered
in
1918
and
in
three
years
later
was
convicted
in
manslaughter
and
the
problem
was
whether
this
is
a
conviction
in
fives
years,
after
entry.
this
court
held
that
it
was
and
there
was
not
--
the
issue
there
and
the
issue
in
the
volpe
case
was
not,
i
submit,
a
one
of
equality.
what
kind
of
an
entry
in
the
sense
of
was
it
a
visit
or
was
it
arrival.
the
--
the
court
projected
the
argument
that
the
word,
"entries"
should
be
modified
or
limited
in
any
way
and
said
one
petitioner
landed
at
boston
and
is
returned
from
south
america.
he
made
an
entry
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
the
court
construed
after
entry
as
meaning
after
an
entry
and
the
second
entry
there
accounted.
but
the
theory
was
not
that
it
was
after
the
last
entry.
the
theory
was
that
it
--
what
he
did
prior
to
this
deportable
conduct
was
an
entry,
that's
coming
in.
now,
in
the
volpe
case,
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
matter
of
a
conviction
of
the
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
prior
to
entry.
volpe
came
to
the
united
states,
was
here
convicted
of
counterfeiting,
left
the
united
states
and
came
back
in.
this
court
held
that
his
--
his
conviction
of
counterfeiting
in
this
country
was
a
--
a
conviction
of
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude
prior
to
entry
--
prior
to
an
entry.
we
--
in
the
court's
opinion
there,
quoted
in
page
12
of
our
brief,
"we
accept
that
view
that
word,
"entry"
includes
any
coming
of
an
alien
from
a
foreign
country
into
the
united
states,
whether
such
coming
be
the
first
or
any
subsequent
one."
now,
the
--
the
petitioner
in
his
brief,
in
his
footnotes,
suggest
that
volpe
was
not
really
arguing.
he
was
questioning
whether
the
second
coming
was
in
fact,
an
entry.
petitioner's
brief
in
the
volpe
case
which
i
respectfully
refer
to
the
court,
does
not
make
any
such
argument.
he
speaks
of
this
two
comings
as
two
entries,
as
they
reentry
and
argue
the
question
here
that
the
word,
"entry"
should
defined
in
one
way
so
that
pre-entry
conduct
should
be
pre
first
entry
conduct
rather
than
just
any
pre
any
entry,
pre
any
entry
conduct.
now
the
--
in
the
third
case,
1939
was
kessler
against
strecker
which
this
court
interpreted
in
the
1918
statute,
as
requiring
the
deportation
only
of
those
members
of
subversive
organizations
who
were
still
members
at
the
time
the
--
the
warrant
of
deportation
was
served
upon
them.
they
--
they
found
the
statute
had
no
--
the
1918
act
was
not
intended
to
reach
persons
who
had
left
the
party.
in
1940,
right
after
that
statute
--
if
i
have
that
case
was
decided
by
this
court.
congress
amended
and
adopted
the
language
--
the
retrospective
language
we're
here
concerned
with
today.
in
the
1940
act,
congress
repeatedly
used
the
phrase,
"entering
in
the
concept
of
after
entry",
as
they
had
before.
now,
that
phrase
it
since
then
been
defined
clearly
as
meaning
the
first
or
any
subsequent
entry
for
purposes
of
grounds
of
deportation.
there
was
no
attempt
to
modify,
limit
or
change
that
broad
definition.
however,
in
the
kessler
and
strecker
problem
of
former
members,
the
court
--
the
congress
did
enact
legislation
to
change
the
law
as
to
that
situation.
the
purpose
of
the
change
was
to
deport
former
members
of
subversive
organizations.
now,
the
--
in
supporting
former
members,
the
senate
report
quoted
on
page
17
of
the
government's
brief,
summarizing
that
proposed
amendment
and
to
also
provide
that
any
alien,
i'm
reading
from
the
bottom,
two
lines
of
that
page
--
page
17,
"any
alien
who
has
been
a
member
of
such
classes
at
any
time
after
the
admission
to
the
united
states
for
no
matter
how
short
a
time
or
how
far
in
the
past,
so
long
as
there
was
act
of
(inaudible)
entry,
shall
be
deported.
that
we
--
we
regarded
it's
inconsistent
for
them
to
read
providing
he
had
not
taken
the
trip
abroad
in
the
meantime,
as
being
a
reasonable
legislative
construction
of
the
--
of
the
intent
at
that
time.
that
--
that
if
you
read
the
way
petitioner
says
that
anytime
after
his
admission,
for
no
matter
how
short
of
time
or
how
far
in
the
past,
so
as
long
as
after
the
date
of
his
first
entry
and
so
long
as
he
has
not
taken
a
trip
abroad
or
left
the
united
states,
at
any
point
since
then.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
i'm
saying
he
would
--
reading
it
--
i
would
be
reading
the
report
if
the
statute
meant
this
amendment,
as
petitioner
would
have
agreed.
these
--
all
persons
who
after
the
first
entry,
shall
be
--
who
have
been
a
member
anytime
shall
be
deported,
unless
they
have
taken
a
trip
since
then.
and
i
submit
that
--
in
saying,
"oh,
were
just
putting
after
last
entry
in
there,
you
are
changing
congressional
--
a
policy
of
no
--
no
recovery
for
any
ex-members
of
the
subversive
organizations.
they
were
not
to
be
able
to
--
to
reform
and
live
in
this
country
--
i
could
to
the
rest
to
the
debate
and
other
comments
on
the
1940
act
make
this
even
more
clear.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
submit
that
what
congress
was
concerned
with
in
using
the
phrase,
"after
entry"
and
"prior
to
entry"
was
not
his
last
arrival
in
this
country.
they
were
concerned
with
people
who
are
members
of
such
organizations
in
this
country
as
contrasting
with
those
who
are
members
elsewhere,
who
left.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
you
--
in
making
that
suggestion,
your
honor,
you
put
the
alien
--
this
--
this
trip
was
16
months.
he
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
went
from
here
to
spain
and
is
back
16
months
later.
the
--
and
when
he
left
there
was
--
although
in
fact
he
came
in
under
a
new
quota,
there
is
nothing
he
did
at
that
time
he
left
to
determine
that
--
that
facts
of
--
he
might
have
been
applied
for
returning
as
returning
resident
alien.
he
did
not.
he
applied
under
a
new
quota.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
do
not
know,
i
couldn't
find
out.
i
tried
to
find
out
why
he
done
it
that
way
and
why
this
is
happening,
i'm
unable
to
find
out.
now,
there
are
two
argument
--
two
reasons
why
i
cannot
accept
your
suggestion.
one
is
that
the
statute
in
the
entire
law
used
entry
as
meaning
any
coming
and
it's
very
hard
to
distinguish
between
the
alien
who
--
who
--
or
they
might
come
from
a
country
such
as
alien
with
a
quota
has
long
backlog
and
who
could
not
afford
to
leave
the
country
and
come
in
on
a
new
quota
with
that
long
wait.
and
the
alien
from
a
country
which
has
no
backlog
on
the
quota
list
and
could
leave
voluntarily
and
come
in
new
quota,
easily,
they
could
come
back
in
on
a
--
on
this
old
one.
i
--
i
think
the
distinction
that
any
such
decision
this
court
would
made
would
be
making
paper
formalities
of
which
type
of
paper
came
back
in
on
that
they
get
a
reentry
permit
after
his
16
months,
or
did
he
come
in
on
new
visa
for
16
months?
as
determinative
when
there's
no
indication
that
it
should
be
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
or
the
regulations
to
slam
any
support
to
such
a
distinction.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
take
more
time
to
fill
out
these
forms
or
wait.
it
would
depend
on
what
country
it
was
coming
from.
but
what
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to,
your
honor.
this
statute
here
excluded
henceforth
all
such
persons
from
entering
thereafter.
so
there
was
not
to
be
any
forgiveness
anybody
coming
in.
and
the
question
we're
--
we're
examining
is,
did
they
mean
as
to
that
group
who
theretofore
prior
to
the
1940
or
1950
amendment,
theretofore
had
been
members
and
no
longer
work.
it's
only
retrospective
in
this
that's
the
only
issue
we're
concerned
with.
there's
no
more
--
no
one
else
can
now
save
himself
by
going
out
and
coming
in
from
this
particular
clause,
because
they're
excludable.
so,
when
congress
was
dealing
backwards
with
ex-members,
do
they
mean
to
say
all
those
who
continuously
resided
in
this
country
who
had
no
additional
foreign
connection
whatever,
must
be
deported?
whereas
all
those
who
had
a
foreign
connection,
whether
it's
one
day
or
in
the
case
you
suggest,
a
longer
period
of
time,
a
substantial
foreign
connection
since
being
a
member
of
the
party,
they
can
be
allowed
to
remain.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
i
can
try
and
see
why
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
statute
says
after
entering
the
united
states.
petitioner
entered
the
united
states
in
1923.
now,
as
to
whether
--
and
he
was
a
member
after
entering
the
united
states,
which
is
undisputed.
now,
in
--
in
the
1940
act,
it
was
proposed
that
aliens
who
have
been
members,
this
is
the
time
they
went
back
--
that
have
been
members
who
had
reformed,
who
had
come
in
and
proved
that
they
left
in
good
faith
that
for
five
years,
they
had
not
been
members
of
the
party
--
five
years
not
been
members
of
the
subversive
organization,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
stay.
this
--
this
was
a
--
proposed
by
mr.
(inaudible)
and
he
talked
about
the
hardship.
that
persons
who
are
long
time
back,
would
want
to
start
fresh.
he
suggests
that
--
this
was
not
too
liberal
to
say
that
if
they
could
prove,
they
left
five
years
before
in
good
faith,
the
mr.
hobbs,
who
was
managing
the
bill
in
the
house
said
--
we've
quoted
at
length
in
our
--
our
brief
on
his
speech.
"we
want
those
who
have
never
sent,
those
aliens
who
have
never
been
a
member
of
such
organization."
and
he
--
and
the
proposal
was
defeated
on
the
grounds
they
wanted
no
procedure
whereby
an
ex-member
will
be
preferred
to
this
country
and
allowed
to
stay
over
aliens
who
were
clamoring
for
admission,
who
had
never
been
members.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
not
by
this
provision.
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
europe,
he
would
not
be
deportable
except
however,
this
may
shed
light
on
your
problem.
if
he
had
previously
entered
the
united
states
and
then
joined,
it
specifically
provides
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
foreign
communist
organizations
indicating
that
they
visualize
persons
might
be
deportable
who
had
been
members
of
foreign
communist
organizations.
now,
the
act
--
the
act
as
we
--
as
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
i
think
was
directed
at
those
persons
who
in
this
country
as
mr.
(inaudible)
in
his
final
statement
said,
"we
want
to
preserve
america
for
those
who
have
never
send
by
espousing
the
cause
of
assassination
of
our
officials
or
government."
and
they've
distinguished
between
those
who
have
been
members
of
other
organizations
abroad
but
those
who
have
sinned,
what
he
calls
sinned,
but
those
are
the
members
of
organizations
seeking
to
overthrow
this
country
and
we
believe
that
is
the
--
the
critical
distinction
between
prior
entry
and
after
entry.
i'd
also
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
--
to
the
other
material
in
the
brief
particularly
the
other
language
in
the
suspension
of
deportations
provisions
in
which
congress
in
the
1952
act
referred
to
last
entered
--
last
entered,
where
they
meant
use
that
language
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
i
--
i
did,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
last
footnote
on
page
23
of
our
brief
which
states
that
the
--
this
action
does
not
preclude
petitioner
from
seeking
discretionary
relief
from
suspension
deportation
under
section
240.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
is
no
--
there
is
--
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
legislations
which
would
or
any
fact
which
would
preclude
petitioner
now
from
applying
for
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i've
looked
into
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
do
not.
i
don't
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
it
is
previous
--
i
don't
know.
i
don't
believe
he's
barred.
i
do
not
know,
on
--
on
this
--
this
--
on
the
timing
in
this
case.
