where
-
where
is
that
in
your
--
justice

yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
does
the
--
what's
the
origin
of
--
the
statutory
origin
or
--
or
its
antecedent
or
its
answers
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
coming.
where
is
it?
mean
any
coming
if
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
is
that
this
court
in
construing
what
an
entry
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
used
that
phrase
and
then
the
--
congress
picked
it
up,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
when
did
the
phrase
--
when
did
congress
first
in
--
by
way
of
definition,
the
word,
"coming".
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
put
--
put
myself,
if
i
may.
do
i
understand
you
that
coming
legislatively
used,
the
word,
"coming",
legislatively
used,
first
appears
in
the
1952
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
prior
thereto,
this
court,
by
way
of
explaining
or
applying
the
word,
"entrance"
have
been
in
the
immigration
laws
so
far
as
i
know,
well,
all
my
life
that
long,
50
years
something
like
that.
that
in
construing
what
an
entry
is,
they
used
this
court
in
decisions
used,
any
coming
in
the
sense
of
--
in
a
temporal
sense,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that,
by
coming
to
them
at
any
time
you're
coming
again,
or
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
have
been
here
less.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
so
far
as
the
--
i
--
i'm
not
arguing
now.
or
not
the
meaning
to
present
any
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
facts
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

is
this
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
was
then
legislatively
adopted,
gave
the
word,
"coming"
in
construing
the
--
the
statutory
phrase,
entry,
a
meaning
other
than
touching
the
shore
whenever
you
touch
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
by
(voice
overlap)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anytime
you
--
anytime
you
touch
the
shore,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
the
--
why
your
discussion
that
coming
means
--
has
a
qualitative
content
in
the
statute
when
it
didn't
have
on
this
--
i
misunderstand
you,
a
qualitative
content
renewed
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
to
be
sure
entry
means
anytime
you
come
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
one
after
the
act.
but
that
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
consequence
of
the
entry
is.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
that
that.
(inaudible)
if
you
tell
me
that
entry
has
always
been
--
entry
has
been
construed
by
this
court
as
meaning
anytime
you
come
in
first,
second,
third
or
fourth,
no
matter
how
long
you've
been
here
and
left
and
then
come
back.
how
can
you
then
say
that
entry
doesn't
mean
when
you
come
in
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
phrase
that
we
have
construe,
after
entry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
we
can
--
can
we
and
i
clear
my
own
mind
by
assuming
that
entry
means
physical
entrance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
when,
we
are
coming
--
coming
means
the
same
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
that
qualitative
content
has
anything
to
do
with
the
content
to
get
to
entry
of
coming,
but
may
have
something
to
do
what
happens
after
you
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
you
--
you
--
i
suggest
on
your
own
argument,
must
throw
out
that
coming
has
a
qualitative
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
trying
to
follow
your
argument,
if
you'll
abandon
it,
that's
all
what
(voice

--
justice
felix

don't
tell
me
to
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
tell
me
some
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
do
that
would
you
mind
stating
in
a
sentence
what
and
make
a
comment
on
mr.
forer's
remarks
that
the
dispensations
provisions
couldn't
be
invoked
or
the
physical
record
wasn't
in
somebody's
hands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
like
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
precious,
you
need
documents
for
which
there
are
no
copies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

i
don't
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
they
here
are
now,
are
these
documents
all
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
where
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
where
are
they
physically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
immigration
authorities
couldn't
get
hold?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
if
--
if
the
suggestion
isn't
a
joke.
they
don't
want
to
pass
on
it
until
the
court
gets
through
that
isn't
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
sounds
awfully
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
negative
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
if
tomorrow
they
grant
that,
this
case
is
moot
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
like
for
myself
to
say
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
may
i
ask
you,
are
you
sure
what
you
actually
gave
him
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
the
department
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
bureau
does
not
deem
itself
included
and
(inaudible)
for
relieving
action
because
it

that
was
defending
in
the
court.
is
that
--
that's
what
you
said,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right
now,
today,
this
afternoon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
--
all
the
department
from

in
view
of
fact
that
such
application
had
been
made
to
the
passing

any
rule
or
procedure
