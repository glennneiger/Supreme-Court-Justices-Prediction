justice
john
m.
harlan
could
he
been
excluded
in
1938,
on
the
basis
that
are
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
law
now,
or
wasn't
been
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
case
is
that
had
defined
the
phrase
did
not
give
it
to
connotation
that
you
call
a
qualitative
connotation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
--
was
there
any
application
for
discretionary
relief
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
hasn't
been
acted
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
record
was
in
the
court,
would
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
mean,
they
didn't
have
it
before
them
physically?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
no.
you
could
say,
either
the
last
entry
or
the
last
entry
under
--
or
the
last
entry
of
which
he
was
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
in
other
words,
if
he
chose
his
second
entry
here
as
the
critical
entry,
that
deems
the
entry
on
which
he
was
admitted
as
a
quota
immigrant,
the
--
his
reentries
--
last
entry
was
merely
returning
and
didn't
get
the
--
wasn't
charged
to
a
new
quota.
but
i
think
that
that's
what
the
statute
means.
i
personally
think
that
it
means
last
entry
and
i
think
that
that's
all
that
section
241
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
can
mean.
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
wouldn't
have
been
true
at
that
time,
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
you're
really
arguing
here
is
the
converse
of
what
was
argued
unsuccessfully
in
volpe.
that's
what
coming
down
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
volpe,
they
contented
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
alien
contended
that
entry
meant
original
entry,
because
the
statute
there
--
the
ground
for
deportation
there
was
a
prior
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
here,
you're
arguing
that
--
that
entry
means
last
entry,
because
you're
dealing
with
an
after
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
what
they
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
they
--
reason
they
don't
pass
on
is
because
they
want
a
decision
on
the
question
of
law.
it
seems
to
me
extraordinary
and
they
don't
act
on
the
thing
that
might
run
to
this
whole
thing
(inaudible)
this
is
a
very
tough
case.
