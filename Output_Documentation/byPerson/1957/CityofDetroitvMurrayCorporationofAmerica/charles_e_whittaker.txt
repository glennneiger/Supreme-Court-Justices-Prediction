justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
fisher,
i
--
i
understood
mr.
taylor's
argument
that
this
contract,
when
read
as
a
whole,
establishes
that
all
the
government
had
was
a
security
land.
now,
would
decision
not
depend
upon
a
construction
of
this
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
part
of
the
situation.
i
understood
that
before
the
(inaudible)
the
government
had
advanced
as
advanced
payments,
some
$510,000
against
which
they
claimed
title
to
property
was
$2
million.
is
it
your
idea
that
you
purchased
and
bought
for
those
advanced
payments,
the
property
worth
$2
million?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
are
the
amounts
wouldn't
make
any
difference
on
the
terms
of
this
contract
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
or
even
if
only
$1000
has
been
paid.
as
i
read
it,
you
would
have
title
to
whatever
dollar
amount
of
property
was
in
the
possession
of
the
contractor.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
then
when
he
uses
your
property
in
the
construction
of
the
chattels
which
you
buy,
you
give
him
credit
or
--
or
you
charge
him
with
the
payments
you've
already
made
on
that
material
and
then
you
pay
him
in
full
for
the
chattel,
at
the
contract
price.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
could
that
not
be
done
by
a
mortgage?
same
as
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
ask
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
a
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
fisher,
you
referred
to
paragraph
(c)
this
contract.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
does
that
provision
not
mean
that
these
partial
payments
shall
in
fact
be
credited
against
the
purchase
price
of
the
goods
when
delivered?
the
language
is
in
making
payment
for
the
supplies
furnished
hereunder,
there
shall
be
deducted
--
and
i
emphasize
that
word,
when
they
asked
you
whether
or
not
that
is
not
the
equivalent
of
saying
that
there
shall
be
credited
upon
the
price,
a
proportionate
--
a
part
of
the
partial
payments
that
were
made.
and
doesn't
that
really
mean
that
the
partial
payments
to
the
extent
applicable
shall
be
credited
as
a
part
of
the
payment
made
by
the
government
for
the
goods?
