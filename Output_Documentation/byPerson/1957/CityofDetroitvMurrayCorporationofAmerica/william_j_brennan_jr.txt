justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
your
argument
then
that
permit
a
michigan
ad
valorem
tax
on
the
federal
post
office
in
detroit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what's
the
effect
of
such
economic
if
--
as
i
understand
it
this
is
a
non
discriminatory
ad
valorem
tax,
that's
your
position
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
effect
except
economic
arises
from
a
property
tax
levied
against
the
post
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
tell
me
the
facts
against
the
post
office
would
be
--
run
afoul
of
federal
immunity
but
this
tax
does
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
you
are
telling
me
that
your
position
would
lead
to
a
valid
tax,
ad
valorem
property
tax
at
least
against
the
federal
post
office
in
detroit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
but
i
don't
--
i
still
don't
understand
how
you
make
the
distinction
between
one
formed
out,
one
not
formed
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
gathered
that
your
argument
was
leading
to
the
proposition
that
the
tax
would
equally
be
valid
against
the
post
office
directly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
before
you
seize
the
taxpayer's
property
under
michigan
law
must
you
obtain
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
tax
a
personal
judgment
against
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
choice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
argument
actually
postulates
titles
to
these
materials
in
the
federal
government,
doesn't
it
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
argument
that
you
are
making?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
we
don't
make
a
problem
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
argument
that
you
are
now
making
postulates
title
of
these
materials
in
the
federal
government,
nevertheless
you
say
that
taxes
assessed
against
the
murray
corporation
measured
by
the
value
of
those
materials.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
this
an
ad
valorem
property
tax,
is
there
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
have
you
any
michigan
decisions
to
say
that
it
is
not
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
any
court
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
michigan
supreme
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that
cited?
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
ingalls
suppose
general
motors
owns
i
gather,
let's
assume,
i'm
not
sure
where
it
is,
the
headquarters
are
in
detroit,
but
it
has
some
of
these
machines
on
lease
on
the
assessment
base
in
some
other
municipality,
in
some
other
county
of
michigan,
which
county
assesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
if
you
have
an
owner
of
personal
property
who
lives
in
one
county,
but
on
the
assessment
date
the
property
is
in
fact
located
in
another
county,
in
the
possession
of
someone
else,
who
taxes
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let's
take
an
actual
situation
of
an
owner
in
your
county
on
the
assessment
date,
you
have
a
single
assessment
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right,
on
january
the
1st
there's
an
owner
of
machine
tools,
he
has
no
residence
except
in
your
county,
but
his
machine
tools
are
in
some
other
county
on
january
1,
in
the
possession
of
somebody
under
lease
or
otherwise.
now
which
county
assesses
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
can't
reach
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
can't
reach
him
in
your
county
even
though
he
lives
there,
can
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
isn't
this
then
just
an
ordinary
ad
valorem
property
tax,
how
can
it
be
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
here
this
opinion
you
referred
us
to
(inaudible)
in
which
what
the
court
says
is,
there
the
tax
is
against
the
person
because
he
owns
personal
property,
or
it's
the
only
reason
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
read
into
it,
reading
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
klein
is
that
tax
rate
a
constant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
it's
arrived
at
by
dividing
what
has
to
be
arrived
at
in
the
way
of
income,
municipal
or
county
as
the
case
maybe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
take
the
total
assessment
and
that
gives
you
rates,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
actually
the
assessments
then,
if
they
include
the
value
of
this
property,
have
their
reflection
in
the
tax
rate
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i've
always
understood
that
was
an
ad
valorem
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fisher
whether
there
is
an
exemption
provision
in
the
michigan
law
which
exempts
property
belonging
to
the
united
states,
there
usually
is
i
think
in
most
of
these
ad
valorem
tax
laws.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
not.
