mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
the
assessment
on
which
the
tax
question
here
was
levied
covered
personal
properties
of
appellee
murray
valued
all
together
at
$12,183,000.
of
this
amount,
appellee
claimed
that
certain
items
described
as
belonging
to
the
united
states
had
been
included,
the
value
of
which
was
determined
to
be
$20,43,670.
such
items
consisted
of
basic
materials
purchased
from
suppliers
by
the
appellee,
an
independent
sub
contractor,
which
it
was
processing
for
parts
and
components
of
aircraft
and
aircraft
engines
to
be
delivered
to
kaiser
manufacturing
company
and
curtis
wright
incorporation
respectively,
the
latter
being
prime
contractors
with
the
united
states
air
force
and
engaged
in
manufacturing
airplanes
for
the
government.
these
assessments
appear
in
the
1952
assessment
roll,
as
charged
to
murray
corporation
of
america.
on
the
specific
line,
the
assessing
officer,
has
in
each
case,
stamped
this
location,
assessed
subject
to
prior
rights
of
the
federal
government.
these
assessments
were
made
under
authority
of
the
charter
of
the
city
of
detroit
and
of
the
general
property
tax
law
of
michigan.
the
total
amount
involved
in
this
specific
case
is
roughly
$80,000.
the
amount
involved
in
other
cases
is
much
greater.
the
subcontract
of
murray
with
kaiser
consisted
of
a
letter
of
intent
executed
on
march
23rd
1951
and
under
this
letter
of
intent,
there
was
included,
a
partial
payment
cause
which
will
be
discussed
later.
kaiser
had
a
contract
running
back
to
the
december
20th
1950
with
the
federal
government
and
wright
had
a
contract
running
back
to
december
12,
1950.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
it
is
murray.
murray
was
the
subcontractor
who
was
the
plaintiff
originally
in
this
action.
kaiser
and
wright
were
prime
contractors
with
the
federal
government,
murray
was
a
subcontractor.
the
partial
payment
clause
provides
in
substance
that
upon
the
making
of
any
partial
payment
under
the
contract,
title
to
all
parts,
materials,
inventory,
work-in-process,
and
non
durable
tools
theretofore
acquired
or
produced
by
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
as
the
case
maybe,
and
properly
chargeable
to
the
contract
under
sound
accounting
practice
will
vest
in
the
government
title
to
all
like
property
thereafter
acquired
or
produced
or
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
the
contract
shall
also
vest
in
the
government.
the
subcontracts
contained
a
number
of
reservations
and
other
sub
paragraphs
immediately
following
the
partial
payment
title
vesting
clause,
notably
the
right
to
acquire
and
dispose
a
property
is
reserved
in
the
subcontractor
subject
to
approval
of
the
terms
by
the
contracting
officer,
which
is
of
course
an
employee
of
the
federal
government.
this
right
maybe
exercised
both
before
and
after
termination
at
the
option
of
the
government
and
by
termination
at
the
option
of
the
government,
it
does
not
mean
that
that
right
maybe
exercised
before
or
after
at
the
option
of
the
government.
it
means
that
termination
is
at
the
option
of
the
government.
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
in
that
respect.
in
any
event
the
proceeds
from
any
disposition
of
the
property
were
to
be
paid
or
credited
to
the
government
as
a
contracting
officer
might
direct
so
long
as
such
proceeds
did
not
exceeds
the
balance
of
any
partial
payments.
upon
liquidation
of
all
partial
payments
received
by
the
subcontractor,
title
would
then
to
whatever
goods
remains
would
revest
in
the
subcontractor
hopping
or
skipping
back
from
the
government.
further
more
property
to
which
--
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
it
would
be
of
any
property
that
had
not
been
delivered
and
which
was
and
which
exceeded
in
value,
the
amount
of
the
partial
payments.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
it
could
be
and
in
fact
it
most
likely
would
be
i
would
think
because
in
the
machine
tools
which
had
been
made
would
already
be
in
existence
and
probably
would
have
been
paid
for
prior
to
this
time
though
it
is
possible
that
machine
tools
in
the
process
of
construction
could
still
have
been
included
in
this
property
that
would
revest.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
well,
it
covers
in
a
property
in
existence.
let
us
say
if
the
government
decided
to
terminate
the
contract
at
any
time
and
it
might
not
be
overproduction
if
there
were
change
in
plans.
i
can
readily
see
how
quite
a
bit
of
raw
materials
and
working
process
that
had
been
accumulated
would
revest
in
the
contractor
who
would
of
course
have
the
right
to
sell
it
and
apply
anything
over
what
he
would
get
on
redo
--
negotiation
of
its
contract
at
the
termination
of
it
to
his
own
profit.
the
title
to
the
property
revest
in
the
contractor.
the
partial
payments
that
are
important
to
this
particular
case
were
received
in
october
of
1951
and
in
december
of
1951.
in
fact
in
each
contract
partial
payments
were
received
on
december
31st
1951
and
tax
day
in
michigan
is
january
1st
of
the
year.
this
court
has
reserved
the
question
of
jurisdiction
on
appeal
although
granting
certiorari
in
this
manner.
we
would
like
to
say
in
reference
to
this
matter
that
we
feel
that
the
court
likewise
has
jurisdiction
on
appeal.
the
statutory
ground
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
a
repugnancy
of
the
state
statute
with
the
--
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
none
really
to
us
but
--
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
we
are
delighted
to
sir.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
it
saves
us
time.
coming
then
to
the
next
point
the
three
major
issues
involved,
and
which
appear
to
be
agreed
upon
by
all
parties,
are
further
the
provisions
for
transfer
of
title
to
the
united
states
of
material
in
possession
of
an
independent
subcontractor
is
authorized
under
federal
law.
secondly
that
if
the
inclusion
of
title
transfer
provisions
was
authorized,
did
the
related
contract
terms
and
undisputed
course
of
conduct
nevertheless
establish
ownership
in
murray
and
paper
title
in
the
government.
and
lastly
whether
or
not
state
and
local
tax
laws
and
non
discriminatory
taxes
levied
there
under,
valid
in
much
as
no
direct
burden
is
imposed
on
the
federal
government
may
be
levied
despite
constitutional
immunity.
i
shall
discuss
the
first
two
questions
and
mr.
ingalls,
my
associate,
shall
discuss
the
last
one.
in
this
connection
also
it
should
be
noted
that
murray
has
raised
the
question
of
so
called
collateral
attack
of
government
contract
in
this
proceeding.
it
should
be
noted,
however,
that
we
are
the
defendants
of
this
proceeding
and
that
it
was
the
plaintiffs
who
is
opposing
government
contract
as
a
means
of
avoiding
this
tax
and
therefore
i
do
not
believe
that
we
are
collaterally
attacking
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
see
no
way
for
this
court
to
ever
get
jurisdiction
of
a
contract,
and
if
the
work
and
activities
of
government
contracting
officers
were
sacrosanct
and
could
not
be
questioned
in
any
proceeding
in
which
a
tax
was
levied.
as
to
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
provide
for
a
partial
payment
title
vesting
provisions,
we
have
raised
the
question
that
section
3648
of
the
revised
statutes
of
the
united
states
prevents
the
advance
of
public
money
to
be
made
in
any
case
unless
authorized
by
the
appropriation
concerned
or
by
other
law.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
“in
all
cases
of
contracts
for
the
performance
of
any
service
or
the
delivery
of
articles
of
any
description
for
the
use
of
the
united
states,
payment
shall
not
exceed
the
value
of
the
service
rendered,
or
of
the
articles
delivered
previously
to
such
payment.”
now
it
is
to
be
noted
that
this
section
of
law
refers
to
advance
of
public
money
and
not
to
the
fine
distinction
which
we
now
draw
between
advance
payment
and
partial
payments,
advance
payments
being
a
loan
by
the
government
for
which
a
lien
is
received
and
of
course
partial
payments
being
advances
made
periodically
during
the
term
of
the
contract
secured
either
by
picking
titles
to
the
materials
or
by
some
other
method.
it
is
also
to
be
noted
in
this
respect
that
the
interpretations
of
section
3648
throughout
the
history
of
its
existence
has
required
that
an
equivalent
in
value
be
given
to
the
government
in
return
for
the
advance
of
public
monies.
in
this
connection,
two
statutes
are
involved
under
which
the
appellee
and
under
which
the
government
claims
authority
to
avoid
section
3648
of
the
revised
statutes.
they
are
the
first
war
powers
act
and
the
armed
services
procurement
act
of
1947.
they
also
claim
some
sort
of
general
authority
without
benefit
of
any
statute,
a
general
authority
to
enter
in
to
contracts
for
governmental
purposes.
with
reference
to
the
armed
services
procurement
act,
i
think
it
should
be
stated
that
the
language
“use
again”
which
authorizes
the
making
of
contracts
of
any
type
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
agents
it
had
would
best
promote
the
interest
of
the
government
refers
to
generic
types
of
contract
rather
than
to
specific
and
(inaudible)
phrases
in
contracts.
on
our
brief
on
page
40,
there
is
shown
a
colloquy
between
members
of
congress
and
a
witness
testifying
for
the
defense
department
in
which
mr.
cole
asked
what
does
that
mean
that
a
contract
maybe
of
any
type?
and
mr.
hill
replied
that
prior
to
the
war,
the
type
of
contract
which
was
generally
used
was
a
lump
sum
or
fixed
price
type
of
contract.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
explain
that
they
are
referring
to
cost
plus
fix
free
contacts,
costs
with
the
predetermined
overhead
contracts,
time
and
material
contracts,
incentive
contracts
and
other
types
of
contracts.
this
we
believe
to
be
the
true
meaning
of
that
section
of
the
act,
and
that
it
does
not
give
the
government
a
general
power
to
make
any
type
of
contract
in
violation
of
specific
statutory
prohibitions.
now
in
the
first
war
powers
act
there
is
clearly
granted
authority
to
enter
into
all
types
of
partial
payment
contracts.
and
had
this
contract
been
made
under
the
first
war
powers
act,
i
do
not
believe
we
would
be
here
in
court
today.
but
in
the
first
place
this
contract
specifically
cities
the
armed
services
procurement
act
of
1947
and
secondly
the
authority
which
was
given
by
congress
to
the
executive
branch
in
the
first
war
powers
act,
although
delegated
by
the
president
to
the
secretary
of
defense
and
by
him
to
the
undersecretary
of
defense
and
through
the
secretaries
of
the
army,
was
not
so
far
as
we
can
ascertain
ever
finally
delegated
to
contracting
officers
so
that
its
provisions
could
be
used
for
that
purpose.
this
means
of
course
that
these
contracting
officers
quite
differently
from
the
claim
of
the
government
in
their
brief,
i
think
it's
page
16
of
their
brief,
quite
different,
it
is
in
their
claim,
did
not
have
authority
under
the
first
war
powers
act
to
enter
into
these
contracts.
now
the
history
of
the
partial
payments
causes
in
this
country
does
not
justify
the
assertion
that
this
type
of
clause
has
been
permitted
to
insulate
or
(inaudible)
section
3648
for
in
all
cases
up
to
the
present
type
of
contract
and
in
the
many
decisions
of
the
attorney
general,
and
of
the
comptroller
general
which
are
mentioned
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellee
and
of
the
government,
we
find
that
something
material
was
being
given
in
return.
but
in
this
case,
we
find
that
it
is
cost,
the
expenses,
traveling
expenses,
(inaudible)
preparations,
all
of
these
are
part
of
the
costs
up
on
which
partial
payments
are
made.
and
these
are
intangible
items
which
if
the
government
sought
to
take
possession
of
them,
they
would
find
that
there
was
nothing
there
to
take
without
forcing
that
this
represents
a
substantial
departure
from
the
original
type
of
situation
which
we
face.
a
very
good
discussion
of
these
is
contained
in
a
recent
article
by
mr.
phelean,
professor
phelean
in
the
summer
issue
of
the
fordham
law
journal
and
i
understand
that
he
was
for
many
years
a
teacher
in
the
judge
advocates
general
school
and
is
one
of
the
authors
of
the
standard
text
on
army
procurement
law
which
is
utilized
by
the
army
in
training
its
officers.
so
our
position
then
on
this
point
is
simply
this
that
as
there
is
a
specific
and
positive
prohibition
of
law
in
section
3648,
there
can
be
no
general
authority
claimed
in
violation
of
a
specific
prohibition
of
law
and
that
under
the
remaining
statutes
there
has
been
delegated
to
these
contracting
officers
no
authority
to
make
this
type
of
a
clause
and
to
place
it
in
procurement
contract.
now
we
come
to
what
i
feel
to
be
the
major
consideration
in
the
study
of
the
partial
payments
clause,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
government
took
title
to
the
property
in
question
and
that
is
we
feel
of
course
always
a
matter
of
intent.
here
the
government
in
murray
seems
to
be
base
their
entire
position
on
one
clause
leaving
out
in
a
reference
to
the
rest
of
the
contract.
they
ask
that
we
look
at
a
language
in
the
partial
payments
title
vesting
clause
to
show
that
title
does
pass.
our
position,
however,
is
based
on
the
entire
contract.
we
ask
examination
of
all
of
the
clauses
as
a
related
whole
for
this
is
the
only
way
at
which
the
true
intent
of
the
parties
can
be
ascertained.
from
an
examination
of
it,
it
is
clear
that
the
government
never
intended
to
buy
raw
material,
plant
layout,
liaison
work
or
other
items
of
costs
useful
and
necessary
for
the
final
production
of
the
desired
in
item.
the
contract
authorized
murray,
as
stated
before,
to
acquire
and
dispose
of
property.
it
gave
murray
an
unrestricted
control
over
scrap
and
determined
what
was
scrap
and
what
was
not
scrap,
placed
the
risk
of
laws
upon
murray
and
provided
for
reversion
of
title
to
murray
upon
liquidation
of
partial
payments.
the
government's
only
real
interest
in
murray's
activities
were
to
examine
and
control
accounting
procedures.
and
in
this
connection,
it
should
again
be
noted
the
use
of
this
phrase
'properly
chargeable
under
sound
accounting
practices'.
in
other
words.
this
was
a
method
of
cost
accounting
not
a
method
of
determining
what
property
was
passed
to
the
government
under
the
title
vesting
provision.
payments
were
made
upon
these
costs
which
included
intangible
items
not
upon
the
value
of
the
materials
appropriated
for
the
execution
of
the
contract.
this
is
not
the
buying
of
goods.
this
is
simply
cost
reimbursement.
compare,
if
you
will,
this
situation,
which
prevailed
in
ansonia
--
in
the
ansonia
case,
which
is
the
leading
case
cited
by
the
appellee
in
support
of
the
progress
--
payments
clause.
in
the
ansonia
contract,
we
find
the
language
parts
paid
for
under
the
system
of
partial
payment
shall
become
thereby
the
sole
property
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
ansonia
contract
the
united
states
government
bought
a
ship
in
parts
as
it
was
delivered.
they
inspected
it,
paid
for
these
parts
and
attached
it
to
the
ship.
this
then
in
each
of
these
cases
there
was
an
equivalent
for
the
money
which
was
expended.
the
main
--
and
not
only
was
this
an
equivalent
i
should
say,
but
it
was
--
the
equivalent
was
a
main
subject
of
a
contract,
the
thing
which
the
government
actually
wanted
to
buy.
the
conclusion
here
reached
by
us
in
reference
to
this
point
is
we
think
heightened
by
the
conduct
of
the
parties.
these
practices
are
set
forth
beginning
on
page
69
of
our
brief
and
perhaps
(inaudible)
were
mentioned
at
this
time,
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
insurance
was
that
the
beneficiary
of
the
insurance
policy
was
murray
only,
not
murray
and
the
government
as
their
interest
might
appear
or
anything
of
that
sort.
that
in
the
conduct
of
this
contract
murray
treated
this
as
its
own
property.
finally
and
this
is
perhaps
the
more
substantial
of
their
argument,
the
government
in
murray
urged
that
ownership
passes
here
because
the
government
wanted
to
maintain
control
over
materials
in
the
process
of
defense
production,
but
it
is
a
clear
control
that
comes
into
being
only
upon
the
option
of
the
party
whom
you
desire
to
control.
in
this
connection
it
should
be
noted
that
kaiser
at
one
time
took
the
partial
payments
clause
out
of
its
contract,
out
of
its
prime
contract,
and
that
it
was
reinstated
in
kaiser's
prime
contract
only
because
murray
insisted
upon
a
partial
payments
clause
as
a
condition
of
accepting
a
subcontract
with
kaiser.
this
means
then
that
as
certainly
as
to
the
kaiser
contract,
the
government
had
no
particular
interest
in
the
control
or
production
under
that
contract
and
that
the
only
reason
that
in
a
such
control
was
ever
given
again
would
be
because
of
the
fact
that
murray
who
wanted
financing
insisted
upon
it
as
a
condition
of
entering
into
the
contract
with
kaiser.
this
means
i
think
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
fiction
and
the
proof
of
that
fiction
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
power,
the
option
to
pass
ownership
to
the
government
rests
with
the
contractor
because
it
is
only
he
who
can
then
initiate
a
demand
for
partial
payments
and
in
this
case
with
a
subcontractor
who
was
not
even
a
party
to
the
contract
with
the
united
states
government.
now
many
cases
are
cited
in
appellee's
briefs,
but
the
other
two
cases
other
than
this
one
which
have
the
precise
clause
involved
here
are
united
states
against
lenox
and
american
motors
against
the
city
of
kenosha.
in
both
of
these
cases,
only
a
paper
of
security
title
is
found.
in
lenox
this
interest
is
designated
as
an
equitable
lien
and
in
the
kenosha
case,
in
american
motors
against
kenosha,
it
is
designated
as
a
paper
i.e.
security
title.
we
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
those
cases
fully
explain
and
justify
the
position
which
we
have
taken
in
this
matter.
and
this
court
has
indicated
that
they
are
willing
to
look
through
such
paper
titles
because
in
allegheny,
it
was
said
that
where
the
private
interest
is
so
propounding
that
all
the
government
holds
is
a
naked
title
and
of
nominal
interest,
the
whole
value
is
taxable
to
the
equitable
owner.
now
i
would
like
to
say
that
although
we
believe
that
this
disposes
of
the
case,
we
also
think
that
this
court
did
not
take
jurisdiction
of
this
clause
simply
to
determine
a
problem
in
the
law
of
sales.
rather
we
think
that
this
action
expresses
a
concern
for
the
problem
which
local
government
faces
from
a
further
expansion
of
federal
power
and
a
further
diminution
of
the
resources
necessary
to
provide
essential
services
at
the
local
level.
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
percentage
of
total
taxes
collected
by
local
government
has
fallen
from
56%
to
12%
between
1932
and
1952
while
debt
collected
by
the
federal
government
has
arisen
from
22%
to
75%.
yet
local
government
must
continue
to
provide
the
necessary
utilities
and
services
for
an
increasing
population
and
an
expanding
federal
program
and
these
efforts
about
which
are
insignificant
to
the
federal
government
become
vital
to
local
government.
this
tax
is
one
within
the
traditional
ambit
of
state
authority.
it
is
not
levied
upon
and
represents
no
discrimination
against
the
federal
government.
it
falls
upon
and
it
falls
equally
upon
all
prime
contractors,
all
private
contractors
including
those
who
do
not
have
progress
payment
clauses
in
their
contract.
there
are
pot-full
claims
of
ownership
here
made,
founded
upon
the
will
of
a
contracting
officer
and
the
decision
of
a
private
contractor
should
not
determine
whether
the
doctrine
of
immunity
recognized
by
the
courts
as
requisite
or
for
our
dual
form
of
government
should
or
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
first,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
remark
which
had
just
been
made
with
respect
to
the
government's
great
desire
for
control
over
the
property.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
partial
payment
are
made
only
at
the
option
of
the
contractor
that
the
government
is
not
overly
concern
about
it
because
this
contract,
that
has
the
power
to
finance
this
contract
by
any
private
means
if
he
so
desires.
the
cost
of
which
would
be
an
element
of
cost
to
him
and
to
the
government
eventually.
but
if
he
chooses
to
take
money
from
the
government
rather
from
his
bank
then
this
so-called
title
comes
into
existence.
now,
the
government
obviously
could
not
be
so
concerned
about
having
control
over
the
goods
as
my
brother
indicates,
otherwise,
that
would
not
be
this
option
on
the
part
of
the
contractor
whether
the
government
would
provide
that
the
moment
that
materials
were
required
for
the
purpose
of
the
contract
title
would
vest
in
the
government
and
no
parts
of
him
should
be
required
at
all.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
actually
have
here
is
a
security
arrangement.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
one
or
two
more
things.
yesterday
the
impression
may
have
been
given
that
this
was
some
type
of
peculiar,
an
unusual
personal
property
tax.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
so.
i
think
that
what
my
brother
meant
yesterday
was
and
as
he
explained
it
to
me
or
is
it
he
was
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
tax
in
this
case
and
the
tax
been
allegating,
but
this
is
an
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax.
i
should
say
this.
our
research
in
this
matter
has
tended
to
indicate
that
perhaps
allegheny
should
be
reconsidered.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
reconsider
allegheny
or
to
do
anything
to
kern-limerick
to
decide
in
this
court's
and
a
title
this
case
can
be
decided
on
whether
or
not
the
government
had
title
to
the
property
or
whether
or
not
this
was
a
security
title
or
a
lien
as
was
held
in
(inaudible)
but
if
we
--
you
wanted
to
go
back
to
reconsider
the
problems
that
were
present
in
allegheny
and
perhaps
some
very
broad
language
in
kern-limerick
as
the
government
can
do
whatever
sound
business
practice
dictates
words
to
that
effect,
which
is
rather
wavering
on
uncertain
standard.
why
--
i
think
that
perhaps
what
would
not
be
inappropriate.
but
so
far
as
we're
concern,
we
have
here
what
amounts
to
no
more
than
an
overreaching
on
the
part
of
government
contracting
officers
you
know
no
doubt
to
their
feeling
that
the
congress
has
been
somewhat
penurious
in
their
granting
of
moneys
to
them.
and
an
effort
to
further
finance
government
contracts
at
the
expense
of
the
state
government
because
this
amounts
to
an
invasion
and
encroachment
and
to
appeal
which
has
been
traditionally
one
on
which
the
states
could
tax.
raw
materials,
things
or
which
had
not
been
put
into
their
finished
forms.
with
respect
to
this
particular
matter,
too,
i
think
it's
in
order
to
emphasize,
the
partial
payments
are
not
made
just
on
property.
partial
payments
are
made
on
cost
incurred.
and
in
the
partial
payments
in
these
case
as
the
stipulation
shows,
there
were
such
matters
including
this
traveling
expenses,
make
ready
cost,
liaison
work,
all
sorts
of
items,
of
course,
which
they
allocated
to
this
contract
but
which
were
not
in
fact
property
or
anything
that
would
give
the
government
any
type
of
security
or
anything
that
they
can
take
over.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
theories
which
you
expressed
with
regard
to
contract
is
overbearing
are
--
are
quite
real
because
if
a
contract
had
made
a
mistake,
let's
say
an
over
purchased
property
for
the
purpose
of
this
contract
knowing
that
he
was
nearing
the
completion
of
it
and
that
therefore
the
title
would
revest
in
him
and
be
useful
for
his
ordinary
business
and
affairs.
if
he
did
it,
the
only
real
remedy
that
the
government
would
exercise
because
as
this
stipulation
shows
also
all
they
did
was
check
their
accounting.
that
was
all
that
was
really
done
in
reference
to
this
matter.
the
only
thing
that
would
be
done
is
that
the
contractor
would
not
receive
partial
payments
based
upon
the
excess
property.
as
a
result
therefore,
he
would
still
be
in
a
position
after
tax
day,
he'd
have
a
whole
year
in
which
he
could
divert
upon
the
completion
of
this
contract
in
which
he
could
divert
the
property
to
his
own
uses.
and
it
seems
like
to
me
that
this
is
indeed
a
very
dangerous
clause
because
it
not
only
inhibits
us
in
an
area
where
we
should
be
permitted
to
tax
but
it
also
permits
evasion
on
other
taxes.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
the
only
practical
--
no.
really,
no.
because
i
think
that
what
happens
is
that
in
each
case
advances
are
made
and
security
is
taken
for
them.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
we
contend
that
as
well,
yes.
but
i
would
say
that
our
chief
ground
as
a
matter
--
mr.
hobart
taylor,
jr.
yes,
that
is
right.
