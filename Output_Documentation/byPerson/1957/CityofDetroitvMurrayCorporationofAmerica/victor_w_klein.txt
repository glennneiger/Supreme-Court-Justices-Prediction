mr.
victor
w.
klein
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
view
of
the
line
of
questioning
of
the
court
i'll
change
the
order
of
my
presentation
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
short
memory
of
the
corporation
counsel
for
the
city
of
detroit
in
characterizing
this
personal
property
ad
valorem
tax
because
shortly
ago,
recently,
the
corporation
counsel
of
the
city
of
detroit
in
a
tax
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
his
brief
said
to
that
court,
“under
the
provisions
of
our
charter
in
an
ad
valorem
assessment
tax
upon
personal
property,
the
property
and
not
the
person
is
assessed
and
yet
he
comes
before
this
court
advocating
the
direct
opposite.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
the
substance
counts
and
it's
for
this
court
to
determine
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
merely
want
to
point
out
to
your
honor
the
provisions
of
the
charter
which
require
jurisdiction
of
the
property
as
the
basis
of
assessment,
all
personal
property
within
the
subsidy
shall
be
the
subject
of
taxation.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
am
sir.
the
meat
in
the
coconut
sir
is
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
upon
the
property
and
jurisdiction
over
the
property
is
the
basis
for
the
tax.
and
there
is
a
case
michigan,
the
phillip's
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
which
hold
that
where
the
property
is
situated
in
a
different
jurisdiction
within
the
state
then
the
owner
of
the
property,
the
place
where
the
property
is
situated,
the
sites,
that
city
has
the
power
to
tax
irrespective
of
the
residence
of
the
owner.
and
that
was
the
question
which
was
discussed
in
allegheny
as
you
recall,
jurisdiction
over
the
property
is
the
determining
basis
for
the
tax
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
tax
bill
is
sent
to
the
owner
or
to
the
person
in
possession
if
the
owner
is
not
there,
is
not
--
does
not
determine
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
the
incident
is
upon
the
property
owned
in
this
case
we
submit
by
the
united
states
government
and
the
mere
fact
that
murray
is
in
possession
in
manufacturing
goods
for
the
united
states
title
to
which
is
in
the
united
states
is
unimportant.
at
least
that
is
our
position
and
we
discussed
it,
we
say
that
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
is
the
situs
of
the
property
within
the
jurisdiction
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
collected
from
the
owner
or
the
person
in
possession
is
unimportant.
and
even
the
person
in
possession,
if
you
please,
under
both
the
city
charter
and
the
state
law
has
the
right
to
go
against
the
owner
to
collect
and
in
--
under
state
law
he
has
lien
for
that
purpose.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
think
i
agree
with
that
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
think
that
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
that
is
correct
sir
and
the
reading
of
the
statute
and
a
reading
of
the
charter
indicates
that
the
thing
taxes
is
property
and
not
the
person
--
the
collection
machinery
is
from
the
person,
but
the
tax
is
imposed
--
and
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
upon
the
property.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
in
that
situation
i
do
agree
sir
if
the
assessment
is
to
the
extent
of
the
lessee's
value
and
not
valued
upon
the
value
of
the
entire
property,
but
of
course
that
is
not
this
case
here
at
all.
and
to
that
point
i
will
now
address
myself,
the
partial
payment
clause,
title
vesting
clause,
here
before
the
court
is
one
that
has
been
used
for
many,
many
years
and
it
doesn't
affect
a
leasing
or
a
use
situation
where
the
contractor
gets
the
use
of
something.
as
you
pointed
out
in
this
court,
in
the
ansonia
case
which
goes
away
back
to
the
early
1900s,
this
very
question
was
before
this
court
and
there,
there
was
a
contract
which
provided
that
a
ship
builder
would
build
a
ship
and
as
percentages
10%,
20%
and
so
forth
of
the
work
was
done
on
the
ship,
partial
payment
would
be
made
to
that
extent
and
title
would
vest
in
the
government.
and
in
the
ansonia
case,
218
us,
the
question
was
whether
that
was
beneficial
ownership
in
title
or
merely
lien
type
because
the
state
of
virginia
lien
laws
came
into
apply
and
if
it
was
merely
lien
type
the
virginia
liens
would
take
precedence
over
the
government's
title
if
it
was
only
lien
title.
and
this
court
pointed
out
though
generally
under
the
law
of
sales
where
a
manufacturer
manufactures
and
a
person
buys,
title
ordinarily
does
not
pass
until
completion
and
delivery.
if
the
parties
clearly
indicate
by
their
contract
that
they
intend
that
title
should
pass
during
the
course
of
construction
if
you
please,
during
the
progress
of
the
work
and
that
is
clearly
stated
that
title,
and
it
isn't
only
lien
title
it's
absolute
beneficial
ownership
passes
as
the
work
progresses
and
you
so
held
in
ansonia
and
i
know
of
no
case
since
then
which
holds
to
the
contrary.
and
we
say
that
the
title
of
partial
payment
title
vesting
clause
in
this
case
and
this
case
used
in
80%
of
the
air
force
contracts
if
you
please,
the
language
is
clear
and
unmistaken
that
this
is
a
payment
upon
the
purchase
price,
it
isn't
merely
for
the
use
of
materials
in
process
in
murray's
hands.
the
government
wants
title
to
the
goods
in
process
while
it
is
being
made
by
murray,
and
it
is
applying
that
upon
the
purchase
price.
the
partial
payment
here
is
not
a
loan.
it
is
not
an
advance
which
can
be
repaid.
there
is
no
provision
for
repayment.
murray
could
not
repay
any
partial
payment.
there
is
no
interest
provided
for
it.
it
is
merely
a
situation
where
a
contractor
is
called
upon
to
perform
a
large
contract
which
will
take
a
lot
of
time
and
where
lot
of
money
is
involved
and
the
government
says
to
him
you
may
get
partial
payments
on
the
purchase
price
as
the
work
progresses
and
the
government
retains
title
until
the
work
is
completed
and
the
finished
end
product
in
which
the
government
wishes
for
its
military
service
is
actually
delivered.
and
the
purpose
of
that
has
been
demonstrated
in
many
cases,
the
government
wants
control
of
these
materials
the
minute
it
arrives
at
the
contractors'
plant.
some
of
these
goods
are
of
high
priority.
during
this
period
steel
and
aluminium
were
in
very
short
supply.
they
were
only
gotten
by
priority.
the
contractor
couldn't
use
them
for
his
own
automative
production.
the
government
wanted
to
be
sure
that
if
something
happened
to
the
contractor,
he
failed
to
perform,
or
he
went
bankrupt
or
whatever
the
cause
maybe
that
it
could
step
in
immediately
and
take
it
because
it
owned
it
and
remove
it
to
another
plant
for
completion.
in
fact
in
this
very
murray
case
goods
were
delivered
to
other
prime
contractors
at
the
direction
of
the
government
where
the
other
government
facilities
were
in
short
supply
of
these
goods.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
think
this
partial
payment
clause
go
back
as
far
as
70
years.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
military,
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
sir,
i
can't
give
you
the
exact
amount
of
time,
i
think
it
developed
from
world
war
ii
and
then
it
was
continued
on
under
the
armed
services
procurement
act?
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
think
that
was
the
case
in
california
called
douglas
versus
(inaudible)
which
involved
almost
not
quite
but
almost
this
identical
clause
in
which
the
position
we
here
assert
was
sustained
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
can
give
you
the
citation
where
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
1942
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no,
it
did
not
immediate
court
sir
and
it's
not
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no
what
was
done
in
california
i
am
advised
sir
was
that
california
then
attempted
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
leasing
of
machinery,
not
just
--
we
are
not
talking
about
this
but
a
use
tax
on
leasing
a
machinery,
but
not
i
am
not
aware
that
there
was
any
problem
on
this
question
as
being
litigated,
again
if
that's
what
you
are
asking
me
sir.
this
very
question
is
again
being
litigated
in
california,
i'm
advised.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
all
i
can
refer
your
honor
to
is
that
the
decision
in
42
and
to
say
the
subject
is
still
being
contested
because
i
am
glad
you
mentioned
that,
because
in
the
present
posture,
defense
spending
is
very
high,
in
fact
with
the
impending
threat
it's
going
to
be
billions
higher
undoubtedly,
the
airforce
advises
me
that
there
is
a
stake
in
this
decision
to
the
airforce
$100,000,000
a
year
in
taxes.
so
conversely
if
the
federal
government
has
stake
in
its
airforce
program
a
$100,000,000
a
year
on
this
decision,
the
state
seeking
to
get
that
$100,000,000
will
be
pressing
for
it
as
they
have
been
pressing
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
it's
a
difficult
question
for
the
court,
which
this
court
very
properly
said
it's
a
matter
for
congress.
if
there
is
immunity
congress
may
waive
the
immunity,
congress
may
waive
this
question
and
in
fact
there
is
before
congress
now
a
number
of
bills,
a
very
comprehensive
study
by
congress
and
another
study
by
a
presidential
committee,
we
make
reference
in
our
brief
the
last
page
of
our
brief
to
these
studies.
and
that's
a
difficult
question.
we
recognize
that
state
government
–
i'm
from
detroit,
i
want
detroit
to
get
as
much
taxes
as
it
can
but
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
what's
that
sir?
mr.
victor
w.
klein
but
as
a
lawyer
well
it's
not
going
to
get
it
from
murray
in
any
event
sir.
the
government
is
going
to
pay
the
bill,
it's
not
going
to
get
it
from
murray.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no
i
didn't
quite
understand.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
say,
as
i
understand
that
proposition
that
question
was
left
open
in
allegheny
and
i
think
that
it
opened
a
serious
question
of
whether
or
not
government
property
leased
to
a
private
contractor
under
the
government's
power
of
ownership
could
be
a
subject
of
a
privilege
tax
if
measured
by
the
extent
of
the
privilege.
i
think
it's
opened
a
question
and
i
think
mr.
fisher
is
to
argue
that
question
in
the
succeeding
case.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
have
not
gone
to
that
part.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
appreciate
that
sir.
that
is
not
in
this
case
because
there
is
nothing
leased
here.
murray
is
not
leasing
goods
as
it
gets
them.
murray
buys
goods
and
makes
them
for
a
prime
contractor
for
the
government
and
the
subcontract
requires
the
approval
of
the
government
that
government
inspector
is
required
to
be
at
the
murray
plant
inspecting
these
goods.
murray
cannot
dispose
of
these
goods,
as
is
suggested
by
counsel,
without
the
approval
of
the
contracting
officer
and
the
fact
remains
under
--
on
this
record
nothing
was
disposed
off
by
murray
to
anyone
except
at
the
government's
direction
for
government
use
in
another
government
contractor's
plant
where
they
were
in
short
supply.
murray
segregated
these
goods,
tagged
them,
earmarked
them
by
contract
number,
the
buildings
were
separate
where
the
defense
work
was
carried
out.
the
goods
were
identified.
they
were
appropriated.
they
were
earmarked
there
could
be
no
question
what
goods
belonged
to
the
government.
then
when
the
partial
payment
was
made
under
the
contract,
title
vested
in
the
government,
what
kind
of
title?
ansonia
says
beneficial
ownership
title.
title
because
the
goods
were
to
be
used
by
the
united
states
when
completed
in
the
end
product
to
what
airplanes,
in
ansonia
ships.
the
government
was
interested
in
those
goods
from
the
beginning
because
the
reason
i
pointed
out
it
wished
to
have
control
and
we've
cited
cases
in
our
brief
american
boiler,
read-york
and
others,
some
involving
almost
identical
partial
payments
in
american
boiler
title
pass
without
any
payment.
payment
is
not
required
to
vest
title
if
two
people,
a
buyer
and
seller
so
agree
and
completion
is
not
required
if
they
agree
under
their
contract.
and
the
clause
here
as
i
say
is
designed
to
pay
a
contractor
part
of
his
purchase
price
as
he
goes
along
on
a
long-term
contract
instead
of
making
him
wait
to
the
end
of
the
road,
but
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
advance
payments
which
are
loans
in
advance
of
anything
being
done,
which
the
contractor
must
repay
and
partial
payments,
which
are
payments
upon
the
purchase
price
which
the
contractor
is
neither
obliged
to
pay
--
repay
nor
is
he
permitted
to
repay
because
the
government
does
not
wish
to
give
up
title
to
the
goods
in
process.
and
the
only
time,
i
think
justice
burton
mentioned
this
vestiture
clause,
the
only
time
that
comes
into
play
sir
is
when
the
contract
is
complete,
the
parts
have
all
been
delivered
and
there
is
some
residual
material
left
over
of
little
or
no
value
because
the
government
ultimately
wants
the
end
products,
holds
the
title
from
the
beginning
and
goes
through
and
gets
the
end
product
and
non
durable
tools
which
have
low
or
no
value
then
vest
in
the
contractor,
but
the
goods
themselves
stay
in
the
government
from
the
beginning
until
final
delivery
and
it's
only
this
minimal
residual
material
which
would
cost
the
government
more
to
move
out
and
store
and
settle
than
to
leave
it
there
that
that
clause
comes
into
operation.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
that
is
right
sir
and
the
history
of
that
clause
about
the
vesting
of
residual
material
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
it
appeared
in
the
federal
register
and
i
think
it
clearly
demonstrates
that,
that
was
the
purpose.
it
was
more
of
a
nuisance
for
the
government
to
get
these
leftovers
store,
sell
it,
and
whatnot
than
to
leave
it.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
what
was
that
sir?
mr.
victor
w.
klein
if
the
contract
is
terminated
before
completion
sir,
the
title
of
the
goods
is
in
the
government
all
the
time,
but
they
are
disposed
of,
the
goods
are
disposed
of,
at
the
direction
of
the
contracting
officer
not
murray.
murray
doesn't
determine
the
disposition
of
it.
the
contracting
officer
does
and
the
proceeds
are
applied
upon
first
the
partial
payments
theretofore
made
by
the
government
to
the
contractor,
because
it's
paid
75%
in
one
case
and
90%
of
the
other
for
the
goods,
so
the
proceeds
are
paid
to
the
government
and
on
termination
as
you
well
know
sir,
the
material
is
virtually
scraped
and
the
government
probably
won't
even
get
enough
to
pay
it's
partial
taxes
and
then
the
contractor
in
turn
files
his
termination
claim
with
the
government
for
the
unpaid
balance
of
his
contract
and
in
these
contracts
before
the
court
it
specifies
particularly,
these
were
letter
contracts
pending
a
definitive
contract,
and
it
says
if
it's
terminated
before
the
contract
it
would
get
fully
paid.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
would
say
yes
sir,
it
would
be
tax
passed
on
to
the
government,
but
that
is
not
determinative
of
the
issue
here.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
i
would
like
to
check
it,
but
that's
my
recollection.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no
sir,
that
was
in
allegheny
and
you
discussed
that,
the
mere
fact
if
it's
a
tax
on
the
property
and
the
property
is
owned
by
the
united
states
and
in
this
case
its
owned
for
its
sovereign
purposes
to
what
airplanes
for
the
military,
that's
what
these
parts
were.
the
tax
is
on
the
property,
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
property.
the
mere
circumstance
that
the
collection
machinery
of
the
tax,
this
ad
valorem
tax
is
against
murray,
doesn't
mean
that
it's
a
valid
tax
or
if
murray
pays
it
that
it
nonetheless
not
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
the
property,
which
is
what
you
in
allegheny
said,
in
fact
in
my
opinion
sir,
your
--
if
i
read
your
dissent
correctly
there,
the
dissent
wouldn't
apply
in
this
situation
because
here
is
the
tax
is
directly
on
the
very
property
to
which
ownership
of
the
government
attaches.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
that's
my
reading
of
it
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
it
is
in
the
brief
douglas
aircraft
versus
byram,
it's
at
page
29
and
64
of
our
briefs.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
well
it
varies
according
to
the
total
assessment
in
the
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
that's
right.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
correct
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
well,
michigan
courts
have
so
stated
and
we've
cited
the
cases
in
our
brief,
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
to
go
into
it,
but
it's
always
been
considered
and
the
michigan
court
has
so
considered
a
tax
on
the
property,
and
even
in
the
(inaudible)
case
sir,
the
question
there
is
one
of
collection
not
of
whether
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
upon
the
person.
they
are
talking
about
terms
of
collection
in
that
(inaudible)
case
and
we
cite
several
other
cases
in
our
brief
where
the
court
clearly
says
it's
a
tax
upon
the
property
and
i
think
you
were
satisfied
when
you
checked
those
cases.
may
i
point
out
that
counsel
for
the
city
and
county
two
days
ago
filed
a
very
voluminous
reply
brief,
some
of
the
statements
of
which
i
believe
are
substantially
in
error.
if
we
would
be
permitted
a
ten-page
brief
within
the
week
i
would
be
very
grateful,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
you
sir.
just
filed
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
we'll
get
it
in
sooner.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
all
right,
we
will
do
that
sir.
