mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
(inaudible)
if
it
please
the
court,
to
supplement
my
learned
colleague's
argument
i
wish
to
refer
the
court
to
the
concern
which
this
court
has
had
over
this
problem
since
1819
when
the
great
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
and
his
court
considered
a
case
of
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
which
case
established
the
so
called
doctrine
or
principle
of
implied
constitutional
immunity
of
the
government
from
taxation,
local
taxation
or
regulation.
the
case
of
mcculloch
versus
maryland
was
unique
in
the
history
of
this
principle.
in
the
fact
that
the
case
as
this
court
undoubtedly
knows
was
involved
rather
a
tax
which
was
a
discriminatory
or
political
tax
levied
by
the
state
of
maryland
on
a
branch
bank
of
the
united
states
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
destroying
that
branch
bank.
in
order
to
protect
the
new
federal
government
from
actions
of
this
kind
by
not
only
maryland,
but
by
other
states,
chief
justice
marshall
handed
down
the
opinion
in
that
case
which
established
the
rule
that
no
tax
could
be
levied
upon
the
means
of
government
operations
and
any
tax
or
regulation
which
would
hinder
or
impede
or
burden
or
control
the
operations
of
the
federal
government
would
be
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
which
provides
simply
that
the
laws
of
congress
are
the
supreme
laws
of
the
land.
now
the
concern
of
the
court
today
is
the
same
as
the
concern
of
the
court
was
in
1819
with
one
exception
and
that's
a
very
important
one
we
feel.
the
history
of
that
case
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland
was
built
up
over
a
long
period
of
years
as
this
court
knows
out
of
a
--
out
of
controversies
between
the
states
and
the
new
federal
government
some
of
the
states
resenting
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
and
seeking
to
either
nullify
them
or
destroy
them.
no
case
since
that
time
that
i
know
of
that
i
have
read
has
involved
a
tax
even
remotely
like
the
tax
in
that
case.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that's
come
before
this
court
since
that
time,
i
maybe
wrong
and
i
stand
to
be
corrected
if
there
has
been
one,
which
involved
a
discriminatory
tax
deliberately
intended
to
destroy
or
impair
or
interfere
with
the
operations
of
the
federal
government.
and
the
tax
now
before
this
court
is
non-discriminatory
tax,
as
my
brother
counsel
has
pointed
out,
levied
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
city
of
detroit
and
the
county
of
wayne's
taxation
procedure
under
the
charter
of
the
city
of
detroit
and
the
state
laws.
a
tax
which
is
levied
in
common
not
only
on
murray,
but
upon
all
comparable
persons
in
possession
or
owning
personal
property
in
the
city
of
detroit
and
the
county
of
wayne.
now,
what
is
the
real
concern
of
this
court
in
a
case
of
this
kind?
it
is
merely
the
question
of
whether
or
not
if
this
tax
is
to
be
a
regulation
could
in
any
way
threaten
a
preservation
and
protection
of
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
government.
if
the
tax
or
the
regulation
has
none
of
the
qualities
of
destruction
or
interference
with
that
supremacy,
it
should
be
good.
if
it
has
the
qualities
or
the
possibilities
of
interference
with
the
activities
of
the
government
and
in
this
instance
with
the
production
of
aircraft
for
the
defense
department,
then
it
should
be
stricken
down
and
i
want
to
say
at
this
point
that
if
counsel
for
the
government
or
for
murray
corporation
can
point
out
any
way
in
which
this
tax,
this
assessment
can
harm
the
government,
can
interfere
with
the
production
of
aircraft,
can
destroy
any
instrumentality
of
the
government,
then
we
say
the
tax
is
bad,
but
i
don't
think
they
could
point
out
on
it.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
murray
has
already
paid
it
of
course,
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
if
the
provisions
of
the
contract
--
by
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
it
maybe
that
in
the
negotiations,
they
have
already
occurred,
i
don't
know
what
has
happened,
in
the
negotiations
for
settling
the
cost
of
the
contract,
these
were
letters
of
intent
contracts
and
so
on,
of
which
i
am
not
too
familiar,
but
in
those
negotiations
for
settling
the
final
costs,
the
profits
between
the
government
and
--
not
between
the
government
and
murray,
but
between
the
government
and
the
prime
contractors,
and
then
through
them
to
murray,
the
tax
that
murray
would
have
to
pay,
maybe
an
element
of
cost
whether
it
be
reimbursable
fully
or
only
partly
i
do
not
know.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
only
in
that
respect
that
the
government
may,
through
the
contract,
have
to
reimburse
murray
for
the
taxes.
what
i'm
talking
about
in
the
way
of
interference
or
in
the
way
of
destruction
and
so
on,
is
outside
of
the
economic
effect.
this
court
has
for
the
past
several
years
held
that
the
economic
impact
of
the
tax
on
the
government,
if
the
government
does
not
have
to
directly
bear
the
tax,
is
not
a
consideration
for
invalidating
a
tax
since
james
versus
dravo,
graves
versus
new
york
and
a
number
of
other
cases
has
settled
that
policy
i
believe.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
directly
on
the
federal
post
office,
no.
if
the
post
office
was
in
the
hands
of
a
private
contractor,
a
private
contractor
was
taxed
for
the
value
of
that
post
office
and
his
own
business
and
only
indirectly
the
economic
affect
being
on
the
government
then
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
correct.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
this
could
result,
and
it
can't
result
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
since
united
states
versus
alabama
was
decided
by
this
court,
but
this
could
be
the
effect
and
the
only
effect
and
the
only
interference
with
the
government
would
be
upon
foreclosure
of
the
lien
provided
in
the
statute
and
the
taking
over
of
the
post
office
by
the
city
or
the
county,
for
non
payment
of
tax.
that
could
not
occur
sir
if
the
government
has
title
or
ownership
of
that
property.
it
could
not
occur,
because
in
united
states
versus
alabama,
this
court
held
that
no
suit
of
course
could
be
brought
against
the
government
and
no
proceeding
for
the
collection
of
any
taxes
could
be
brought
against
the
government
or
its
property.
that
case
was
a
case
where
the
tax
itself
originally
was
assessed
against
a
private
individual
and
the
lien
went
into
effect
when
the
private
individual
owned
the
property.
but
the
government
bought
the
property
after
that
and
then
they
refused
to
pay
the
tax
and
then
a
proceeding
was
brought
for
enforcement
of
that
lien
against
the
government's
property
which
was
(inaudible).
the
court
said,
chief
justice
hughes
delivering
the
opinion
that
the
tax
was
good,
the
lien
was
good,
but
it
could
not
be
collected
by
foreclosure
against
the
government
property.
so
at
all
times,
the
government
and
its
property
is
protected
from
any
adverse
action
in
the
way
of
seizure
of
its
property.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
didn't
say
it
would,
under
those
circumstances
if
it
pleases
you.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
maybe
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
it
was
formed
out,
that's
right,
it
was
leased
out
to
a
private
corporation
for
profit
and
the
tax
was
against
that
private
corporation,
as
it
is
here
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
distinction
is
this,
and
this
court
has
made
the
distinction.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
no,
no,
you
misunderstood
or
i
didn't
make
myself
clear,
absolutely
not,
we
do
not
contend
that
a
direct
tax
against
a
post
office
or
against
this
building
or
any
government
building
without
an
intervening
third
party
who
was
the
tax
payer
and
whom
we
can
assess
the
tax
against
and
also
collect
from,
i
say
no,
those
taxes
would
be
bad.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
correct.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
if
it
pleases
the
court.
i
think
its
time
that
both
allegheny
and
(inaudible)
be
reappraised
by
this
court
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
--
in
the
light
of
correct
principles
of
this
doctrine.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
do
say
this,
that
this
case
is
distinguished
from
both
allegheny
and
(inaudible)
in
the
facts
but
the
distinction
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
how
is
it
different
from
allegheny?
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
well
number
one,
the
machinery
which
was
involved
in
the
allegheny
case
was
owned,
purchased,
owned,
delivered
to
the
government.
it
was
machinery
either
brought
into
the
plant
of
mesta
in
that
case
by
the
government
from
some
other
place,
or
manufactured
by
mesta
or
ordered
by
mesta,
but
the
government
owned
the
property
and
owned
the
machinery,
paid
for
it
and
then
leased
it
back
to
mesta
for
use
in
the
production
under
a
government
contract.
that
is
one
of
the
distinctions.
the
second
distinction
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
it
was
leased
back
to
mesta,
that's
correct.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
don't
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
don't
think
it
should
and
i
think
your
honor
was
correct
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
maybe
it
comfort
your
honor
to
have
a
re-appraisal
of
that
case
and
that's
what
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
(inaudible)
there
was
property
which
was
--
now
there
was
a
contract
as
your
honor
recalls
which
had
a
provision
making
the
contractor
the
purchasing
agent
of
the
government,
so
that
the
contractor
in
purchasing
these
particular
materials,
i
remember
i
think
they
were
tractors
for
use
in
the
government
construction
contract,
in
purchasing
those,
he
was
subject
to
the
or
the
purchaser
rather
was
subject
to
the
state
sales
tax,
because
the
state
sales
tax
provided
that
the
purchaser
was
a
taxpayer
responsible
for
payment
of
the
tax.
so
that
when
the
government
via
the
contractor
made
itself
or
made
the
contractor
its
agent,
rather
than
independent
contractor,
then
it
was
the
same
result,
the
tax
was
directly
upon
the
government.
now
that
of
course
is
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
but
it's
not
the
situation
here,
because
the
contractor
is
not
the
purchasing
agent
of
the
government,
not
the
tenant
either,
that
the
contractor
is
the
purchasing
agent
of
the
government.
he
is
an
independent
contractor,
in
fact
a
subcontractor
and
the
contract
even
provides
that
the
government
is
not
a
party
to
the
contract
and
there
is
no
obligation
upon
the
part
of
the
government
under
that
contract,
strictly
a
contract
between
the
five
contractors
and
murray
which
is
the
subcontractor.
now
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
not
at
all,
not
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
partial
payment
clause
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
by
force
(inaudible)
partial
payment
clause
the
government
acquires
title
to
recent
material
and
work-in-process,
upon
the
making,
a
meeting
upon
the
making
of
the
partial
payment.
now
the
partial
payment
maybe
in
any
amount
of
course,
but
not
only
does
the
government
take
pay
roll
to
the
partial
payments
for
which
costs
have
already
been
incurred
by
the
contractor,
but
also
for
all
future
acquired
materials
in
that
claim.
now
this
tax
is
not
directed,
we
say
against
the
materials.
it
is
directed
against
a
private
corporation.
it
is
a
personal
tax
in
nature.
the
contractor
here
distinguishing
from
(inaudible)
is
not
in
any
respect
the
agent
of
the
government.
he
is
completely
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
legal
incidence
is
entirely
upon
the
murray
corporation.
the
legal
instance
entirely
upon
him,
not
only
in
the
assessment,
in
the
collection
which
can
only
be
made
against
murray
corporation,
the
city
of
detroit
and
the
county
of
wayne
can
sue
murray
corporation
for
collection
if
it
does
pay
it
as
a
debt,
as
a
personal
obligation
and
can
seize
any
of
his
personal
property.
we
cannot
seize
and
we
cannot
touch
any
property
of
the
federal
government,
if
this
is
property
of
the
federal
government,
truly
we
cannot
touch
it.
now
we
say,
in
our
brief
we've
discussed
this
quite
at
length,
that
the
federal
government
and
its
property
if
this
is
truly
the
property
of
the
federal
government
is
completely
protected
from
any
action
by
the
city
or
the
county,
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
harm
outside
of
economics
to
the
government
in
this
case.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
in
this
particular
instance
--
no
we
have
a
choice,
we
have
a
choice
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
--
to
proceed
against
him,
in
this
instance
under
the
charter
and
the
state
tax
law,
we
can
make
the
taxpayer
or
make
the
person
in
possession
of
personal
property
the
taxpayer
and
that's
what
we've
done
here
and
then
if
its
not
paid
we
can
sue
him
as
a
debt
in
assumption.
we
collect
that
tax
or
we
can
proceed
against
the
property
or
any
of
his
property
no
matter
what
it
is,
where
we
can
find
it.
that's
a
remedy.
now
we
can
also
--
it's
true
there
is
question
about
it,
seize
the
property
which
is
used
for
evaluation
of
this
tax,
the
materials,
if
a
private
corporation
owned
these
materials
under
our
tax
law
we
could
these
materials
in
payment
of
the
debt.
but
if
the
government
has
title
to
them,
no
matter
what
the
title,
then
we
can't
touch
them.
now
the
effect
on
the
government,
so
far
as
these
materials
are
concerned
would
be
much
worse
if
they
were
completely
owned
by
the
murray
corporation,
and
this
court
would
not
be
concerned
with
that
at
all.
in
other
words,
the
property
of
the
murray
corporation,
the
real
property,
there
is
no
question
about
the
tax
on
the
real
property
of
the
murray
corporation,
but
if
we
seize
that
plant
out
from
under
murray
and
he
can't
use
it
for
producing
government
goods,
then
there
is
more
harm
certainly
to
the
government
then
there
possible
could
be
in
this
instance.
i
haven't
been
watching
my
time.
the
sum
in
substance
of
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
federal
government
is
in
no
way
harmed,
nor
could
it
possibly
be
harmed,
there
is
no
threat
to
the
preservation
or
the
protection
of
the
federal
government
or
its
supremacy
in
the
levying
of
this
tax
or
in
the
collection
of
the
tax
or
in
anyway
possible.
we
feel
that
the
cases
of
james
versus
dravo,
of
graves
versus
new
york,
oklahoma
tax
commission
versus
texas
and
so
on,
all
of
which
have
laid
down
the
principle
following
the
principle
in
mcculloch,
that
an
indirect
tax
which
does
not
interfere
with
the
activities
or
the
functions
of
the
federal
government
should
be
a
valid
tax
under
the
immunity
doctrine.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
because
it's
levied
against
a
private
corporation
and
collectable
against
the
private
corporation.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
presumably
for
their
payment
of
their
share
of
the
local
cost
of
government.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
we
say
it's
levied
against
the
murray
corporation
under
our
charter
–-
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
--
actual
levy
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
for
the
payment
of
murray's
share
of
the
cost
of
local
government.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
subject
matter
of
the
tax
so
far
as
its
valuation
is
concerned
or
so
far
as
it's
measurement
is
concerned
is
the
material,
that's
correct.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
possession
alone,
we
can
tax
under
the
charter
in
laws
and
that's
been
upheld
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
possession
alone,
we
can
tax
the
person
in
possession.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
not
necessarily
–-
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
if
they
are
not
in
the
federal
government
then
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
then
murray
is
the
owner.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
correct,
and
it
could
be
either
way,
i
mean
if
he
could
be
the
owner
and
still
be
the
same
tax,
the
same
material.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
very
--
because
murray
is
in
possession
of
these
materials
is
permitted
under
the
charter,
that
we
tax
him.
that's
only
true
in
cases
of
personal
property.
it's
not
through
in
case
of
real
property
in
michigan.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
we
don't
feel
that
it
is.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
recognize
that.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
right
in
our
brief
we
have
the
decision
and
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
says
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
yes
court
decision
(inaudible)
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
a
michigan
supreme
court
case
which
says
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
in
personam.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
understand,
we
would
then
--
the
assessors
rather
would
then
try
to
determine
the
owner
and
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
owner
of
the
property
of
the
materials
or
of
the
(inaudible)
the
materials,
determine
the
owner
or
the
person
in
possession
and
name
that
person
whoever
he
maybe
as
the
tax
payer
on
the
tax
roll.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
for
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
for
a
tax
which
would
be
measured
by
the
value
of
that
property
which
he
either
owned
or
had
in
his
possession.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
right,
the
ratable
portion.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
right.
he
doesn't
have
to
have
it
for
year,
as
long
as
he
has
in
his
possession
on
tax
days.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
he
is
the
tax
payer.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
well,
it
could
be
the
owner.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
it
probably
could
be
both.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
we
don't
say
we're
taxing
possession,
but
we're
taxing
him
because
he
has
it
in
his
possession.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
only
one
tax.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
owner
if
he
can
be
found
or
determined,
sometimes
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
owner
of
personal
property.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
yes.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
this
is
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
this
is
a
little
different
from
that,
we
don't
claim
this
is
a
privilege
tax.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
we're
not
claiming
it's
a
privilege
tax.
it's
a
personal
property
tax
which
can
be
and
is
levied
against
a
private
person
collectable
against
that
private
person.
that's
our
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
we
are
not.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
right.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
it
maybe
at
our
choice,
yes.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
it
is
not
mandatory.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
not
at
all,
and
these
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
exactly,
in
these
charter
provisions
are
the
same
charter
provisions
in
effect
for
200
years,
or
150.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
didn't
quite
get
that
query.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
well,
under
certain
circumstances
we
can
levy
the
tax
--
the
tax
can
be
levied
by
the
jurisdiction
having
jurisdiction
over
the
owner.
in
other
words
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
right.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
january
1st.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
undoubtedly
the
other
county.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
person
in
possession.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
wouldn't
say
so,
no
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
it
has
the
characteristic
certainly
of
an
ad
valorem
property
tax,
but
are
our
only
contention
in
this
case
is
that
it
also
is
in
the
nature
of
a
personal
tax,
because
it
can
be
levied
against
the
person
and
collectable
against
the
person
without
touching
the
property.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
read
into
that
or
because
he
is
in
possession
of
personal
property
which
is
this
instance,
and
that
instance
he
happened
to
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
well
if
you
read
the
charter
into
that,
which
permits
us
to
levy
the
tax
against
a
person
in
possession.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
city
charter,
that's
correct.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
could
be.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
not
under
those
circumstances
your
honor
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
--
where
the
government
has
taken
over.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
private
corporations
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
if
the
government
had
taken
over
the
private
corporation
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
no,
only
if
the
private
corporation
was
still
operating
as
a
private
corporation,
not
taken
over
by
the
government
as
its
agents,
then
we
could
tax
the
private
corporation.
that
would
be
a
direct
tax
against
a
private
corporation
and
not
against
the
government.
government
might
have
to
pay
the
tax
in
the
record.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
they
are
not
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
or
the
correct
principles
of
the
doctrine
at
all.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
when
your
honor
said
that
yourself,
i'm
not
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
it
is
presumptuous
on
my
part
to
ask
that
your
honor.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
right.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
that's
correct.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
effect
is
same
your
honor.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
the
effect
is
same.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
no
that's
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
we
do
not
care
to
rely
upon
fictions
or
upon
labels
or
titles,
if
the
court
please?
we
would
like
the
court
to
look
to
substance
in
this
case.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
what
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
we
only
thought
that
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
if
it
pleases
your
honor
we
only
talk
that
way
because
distinctions
have
to
be
made
and
are
being
made
with
alleghany
and
cases
of
that
kind.
we
think
the
substance
of
this
--
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i
maybe
suggesting
that.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
most
of
these
distinctions
your
honor
are
distinctions
without
much
difference.
i
intended
to
reserve
sometime
for
the
rebuttal,
because
of
the
questions
i've
lost
track
of
the
time.
mr.
vance
g.
ingalls
i'm
sorry.
