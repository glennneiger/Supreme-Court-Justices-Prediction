mr.

chief
justice
earl

mr.
ingalls.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
your
law
is
there
any
distinction
between
this
particular
tax
and
the
tax
that
you
normally
levy
against
an
automobile
or
a
tractor
or
a
bicycle
or
something
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
the
same
tax.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
your
time
has
been
up
for
some
time
mr.
ingalls,
but
that's
not
your
fault,
i
admit
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
klien.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
has
that
been
the
custom
of
the
government
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
80%
of
the
air
corps
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
contracts
are
that
way
how
long
have
they
been
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
--
the
reason
i
ask
you
is
i
don't
question
right
except
for
this
extent
i
seem
to
remember
that
in
my
state
where
they
had
a
great
deal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
airplane
manufactured,
and
the
government
provided
them
as
contracts
but
those
planes
should
be
delivered
in
another
state.
we
taxed
them
in
california
and
i
seem
to
remember
army
officers
and
airforce
officers
up
at
our
state
capital
trying
to
get
the
law
changed
so
that
we
would
not
charge
them
not
because
the
government
is
particularly
interested,
but
because
it
would
put
our
airplane
industry
in
a
bad
position
economically
with
other
airplane
manufacturers
in
the
country.
now
am
i
wrong
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
how
long
ago
was
that
just
if
you
remember,
if
you
don't
well
i
don't
–
don't
worry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
that
discontinue
the,
did
that
discontinue
the
practice
of
taxing
in
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
but
what
i
was,
what
i
was
thinking
of
it,
the
government
had
done
that
clearly
for
many
years
and
it
had
been
accepted,
i
wonder
why
the
government
would
be
up
at
our
state
capital
trying
to
get
the
legislature
to
relieve
these
machines
from
taxation
after
they
were
completed
not
during
the
course
but
after
they
are
completed
and
before
they
flew
out
of
the
state
to
some
other
point
of
delivery.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
other
fellow?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
for
the
other
fellow?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
klein,
could
you
gave
me
the
name
of
that
california
case,
you
spoke
of,
is
it
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
assume
you
are
going
to
be
that
long
you
better
get
in
sooner
than
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
better
get
it
in
this
week.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
that
about
again
please,
i
missed
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher
may
i
–
may
i
--
do
you
happen
to
know
how
long
the
air
force
has
been
doing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
new
since
memory,
current
memory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
devised,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
rather
uniformly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
they
do
like
they
did
in
the
(inaudible)
just
in
that
particular
case
the
contracting
officer
as
i
understood
it
made
that
contract.
it
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
the
contract
in
general
use
in
air
force
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
apparently.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
18
and
number
32
--
or
36.
mr.
fisher,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher,
has
the
state
of
michigan
interpreted
it
that
way
in
its
decisions
or
has
it
interpreted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
authorizing
to
say
that
if
he
thinks
the
automobile
is
outmoded,
he
can
sell
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you
to
just
follow
up
that
sentence
you
were
reading
about
the
scrap
on
liquidation
of
all
partial
payments
hereunder
or
upon
completion
of
deliveries
called
for
or
by
this
contract
titled
to
all
property
or
the
proceeds
thereon
which
has
not
been
delivered
to
and
accepted
by
the
government
under
this
contract
or
which
has
not
been
incorporated
in
supplies
delivered
to
and
accepted
by
the
government
under
this
contract
and
to
which
title
has
vested
in
the
government
under
this
article
shall
vest
in
the
contractor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
do
you
get
that
out?
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
this
particular
section
that
i
just
read
to
you?
tell
me
in
the
languages
of
that
what
limits
it
to
scrap
for
the
jigs
says
upon
liquidation
and
so
forth,
titled
to
old
property
or
the
proceeds
thereof,
which
has
not
been
delivered
to
and
accepted
by
the
government
under
this
contract
or
which
has
not
been
incorporated
in
supplies
delivered
to
and
accepted
by
the
government
under
this
contract
and
to
which
title
has
vested
in
the
government
under
this
article
shall
vest
in
the
contractor.
now,
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
scrap
of
jigs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
necessarily.
they
might
have
--
they
might
have
purchased
a
lot
of
things
in
the
eventuality
that
--
that
should
have
a
lot
of
breakage
and
a
lot
replacements
and
things
of
that
kind
and
it
would
be
valuable
property
that
was
--
was
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
--
that
isn't
scrap
and
that
isn't
jigs
as
i
understood
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
were
not
used.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
let's
go
and
say
that
--
let's
say
that
weren't
used
if
they
were
property
of
the
government
and
under
your
theory
and
they
give
them
back,
revest
them
in
--
revest
them
in
the
corporation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
fisher?
just
supposed
that
a
--
that
a
corporation
was
tax
minded
and
it
--
it
said
in
--
if
we
take
a
very
extreme
case
who
said
that
instead
of
--
of
putting
in
this
--
into
this
contract
the
exact
amount
of
materials
that
are
needed
and
it
will
--
will
just
put
up
twice
as
much
and
then
it
won't
be
necessary
for
us
to
pay
any
taxes
on
it
and
they
go
ahead
and
build
the
--
the
machinery
whatever
it
was.
and
at
the
end
of
that
time,
it
had
enough
left
over
for
another
machine.
in
the
meantime,
he's
escaped
taxes
on
that.
is
that
--
would
that
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
wouldn't
it
be
a
little
more
accurate
to
say
that
the
tailor
bought
the
goods
for
let's
say
$50
and
you
said
that
when
we
pay
you
$10,
it
belongs
to
us
and
then
you
go
ahead
and
make
it
up,
isn't
that
what
you
do
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
lot
of
difference
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
isn't
it
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
of
goods.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that'd
be
20%
of
a
suit
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
do
you
mean
by
--
by
that
the
government
could
defeat
the
--
the
tax
of
the
city
by
paying
nothing
to
the
man
at
all
by
just
saying
we
own
it
and
we
own
whatever
you
have
purchased
to
--
to
manufacture
this
--
this
article
and
we
can
dispose
of
it
as
we
you
believe
that
without
any
payment
at
all
it,
it
could
defeat
this
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
taylor,
would
you
like
five
minutes?
we
--
we
cut
you
off
pretty
--
we
charged
with
a
lot
questions.if
you
want
five
minutes,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
--
you
may
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
taylor.
