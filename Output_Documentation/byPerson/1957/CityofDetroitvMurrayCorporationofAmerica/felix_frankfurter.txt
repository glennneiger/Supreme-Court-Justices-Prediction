justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
if
the
post
office
were
formed
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
the
third
person
insulates
it
even
though
an
economic
burden
is
passed
on
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
aren't
you,
in
saying
that
aren't
you
really
asking
this
court
--
aren't
you
rearguing
allegheny?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
but
that
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
agree
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
take
care
of
justice
douglas's
(inaudible)
tell
how
it's
differentiated
from
allegheny?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
a
significant
distinction?
it
was
leased
in
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
title,
all
the
niceties
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
comforts
me,
but
it
doesn't
wipe
out
the
fact
the
decision
went
against
my
views?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what
levied
against
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
don't
mean
generally,
but
what
is
the
object
of
the
tax?
what
is
the
subject
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
said
that
we
don't
care
what
label
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
puts
on
a
tax,
and
it
may
even
deny
that
a
tax
is
a
certain
tax,
is
that
this
court
find
that
it
is
or
it
isn't
and
to
state
its
constitutionality
or
find
unconstitutionality,
so
forget
all
about
labels;
all,
everything
that
your
supreme
court
has
said
and
that
you
said,
it
would
help
me
greatly
if
you
would
take
exactly
this
same
situation,
the
murray
corporation,
the
same
things,
the
same
transactions
except
the
private
person
in
relation,
in
the
position
of
where
the
united
states
is,
just
give
me
a
concrete
case
and
then
state
what
it
is
that
would
be
taxed
in
that
court
for
what
amount
and
what
the
remedies
would
be?
have
i
put
my
question?
just
forget
about
the
united
states,
assume
a
big
corporation
named
uncle
sam,
a
private
corporation
engaged
not
in
war
business,
but
in
automobile
business,
has
this
same
relation,
the
same
kind
of
an
agreement,
same
kind
of
a
transaction
with
the
murray
corporation.
now
what
would
happen
in
michigan
or
wayne
county?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
owner
you
mean
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what,
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
concrete
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
murray
corporation,
suppose
a
subcontractor
of
a
ford
or
the
general
motors
has
things
like
this
in
its
possession
by
the
same
kind
of
leasing
arrangement
or
contract
arrangement,
he
would
be
taxed,
it
would
be
taxed
for
the
value
for
a
certain
percentage
of
the
value
of
the
total
value
of
what
he
has
in
his
position,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
and
you
wouldn't
care
whether
you
owned
it,
so
long
as
he
has
the
use
of
(inaudible)
for
a
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whatever
it
is,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
owner
you
mean
that
fellow
who
got
the
full
title,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
you
would
tax
the
owner
because
he
owns
it.
you
could
tax
the
lessee
because
he
enjoys
its
use.
but
that
isn't
what
you
are
doing
in
michigan,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
are
you
doing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
you
are
taxing
the
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
figurative
way
of
talking
because
things
aren't
owned,
somebody
owns
it,
and
while
we
talk
that
way,
it
means
you
are
taxing
somebody
who
has
a
proprietary
relation
to
something
called
property
and
you
say
that
you
could
tax
the
owner
if
you
can
get
hold
of
him
although
he
may
have
leased
his
machine,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
can
get
to
the
owner,
if
is
it
merely
(inaudible)
of
getting
the
owner
or
at
your
choice,
if
you
go
after
the
fellow
who
actually
at
the
time
has
the
thing
is
his
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ingalls,
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is
now
of
course,
but
not
so
long
ago
fellows
who
make
shoes
in
michigan,
there
must
have
been
shoe
factories
for
big
shoe
makers,
had
to
--
if
they
had
machines
they
leased
them
from
the
shoe
machines
of
the
united
shoe
machinery
company.
now
in
that
case,
this
tax
would
be
levied
against
all
the
fellows
around
detroit
who
had
leased
two
machines
from
the
united
shoe
of
massachusetts,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
the
united
states
government
during
war
had
taken
over
united
shoe
machinery,
had
taken
over
all
the
outstanding
leases,
your
argument
is,
that
detroit
could
still
have
accessed,
levied
this
tax,
whatever
it
is,
against
those
shoe
fellows,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
government
has
taking
over
the
business
of
the
shoe
machinery,
but
it
hasn't
taken
over
the
manufacturing
of
shoes,
it
took
over
the
leases
whereby
the
shoe
machinery
was
leased
throughout
the
united
states
by
the
united
shoe
machinery
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
the
government
had
taken
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
lease,
yes,
if
it
taken
over
these
outstanding
leases,
and
thereafter
royalties
would
to
be
paid
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
yes.
but
this,
the
government
here,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
does
this
great
problem,
for
a
great
problem
it
is,
at
least
to
me
a
very
great
problem,
the
allocation,
the
tapping
of
resource
within
states
and
municipalities
in
which
the
government
has
some
kind
of
interest,
i
purposely
use
that
loose
phrase,
this
great
problem
of
determining
what
resources
may
still
be
trappable
by
the
local
communities,
although
the
government
has
some
kind
of
interest
in
it.
now
some
things
are
clear.
the
government's
own
ownership
can't
be
taxed.
you
can't
tax
the
post
office
as
you
indicated
in
detroit.
another
thing
is
clear
that
no
matter
how
it
forms
out
its
business
you
can't
levy
to
take
over
the
billing
in
fact
it
does
government
business,
because
there
you
are
interfering
with
government
operation.
then
we've
got
in
between
things
to
which
dravo
is
one
thing,
to
which
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
an
incidence
of
financial
burden
to
the
government
isn't
enough
to
immunize,
that's
dravo,
if
it
means
anything,
it
means
that.
then
you've
got
alleghany
which
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
know
what
it
means,
but
it
can't
turn
on
these
niceties
of
title
or
the
niceties
of
looking
where
or
who
has
--
who
is
owner,
that's
of
all
the
treacherous
phrases,
that's
one
of
the
worst.
what
is
your
position
on
this
thing?
i
can
understand
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
these
two
cases
you've
been
talking
about
on
the
theory
that
they
are
negative
or
that
they
contradict
the
implications
of
dravo,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you're
--
i'm
respectful
when
this
court
says
it
has
decided
and
it
is
in
accord
with
principle,
it
is
that
until
i
get
overruled
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know,
but
it
isn't
any
good
to
you,
unless
you
can
get
five
others
to
agree
with
you.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
a
gross
fiction
to
day
you
can't
find
them
because
you
can't
tax
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
terrible
fiction
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
why
do
you
shrink
from
saying
that
a
fellow
who
has
the
use
of
property
although
it's
owned
by
the
united
state
enjoys
wealth
can
exercise
power
although
uncle
sam
made
it
possible
for
him
to
exercise
that
power
and
we'll
tax
him
for
that.
these
labels
are
no
good
at
all
for
my
--
for
me
not
one
of
them
is
worth
anything
except
to
reach
a
result
that
you
reach
otherwise.
but
you
can't
get
anywhere
by
talking
in
personal,
at
that
(inaudible),
at
personal
property,
is
that
real
property,
is
it
a
licence
tax,
is
it
a
privilege
tax,
those
are
all
nice
checkers
on
the
checker
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
not
reality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
take
the
distinction
isn't
any
good
and
you
very
candidly
ask
this
court
to
reconsider
the
whole
problem,
isn't
that
what
you're
doing?
i
thought
you
did,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it's
perfectly
appropriate
to
ask
of
course
to
reconsider
a
constitutional
principle,
but
you've
got
them
--
if
you're
going
to
make
a
distinction,
(inaudible)
and
you
certainly
can't
get
any
comfort
from
the
dissenting
opinion
except
intellectual
comfort
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
would
it
make
a
difference
to
you
if
i
don't
know
how
the
charter
is
deployed,
is
that
a
home
rule
charter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
this
court
should
sustain
your
position,
affirm
this
judgment
and
then
the
appropriate
charter
amending
authorities
would
say
we've
heard
this,
the
client
say
this
is
argued
vigorously
and
persuasively
but
this
is
a
property
tax,
we
now
have
to
change
it,
would
that
be,
would
you
then
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
saying
that's
an
error?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
difference
does
it
make
that
he
said
that
in
a
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
they
called
it
very
elegantly
as
language
can
be
drafted
in
detroit
and
it
can
be
i
know
some
of
the
lawyers
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
they
call
it
the
privilege
tax
whereas
the
murray
company
is
enhanced
in
its
power
in
having
property
on
lease
belonging
to
the
united
states
(inaudible)
mean
something,
will
that
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
let's
get
down
to
the
real
stuff
in
the
coconut.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
whether
i
am
wrong
in
thinking
that
jurisdiction
to
tax,
the
jurisdiction
to
tax
property
means
only
that
the
taxing
power
has
such
relation
to
the
property
that
there
is
no
constitutional
barrier
to
make
some
exaction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
the
jurisdiction
--
i
mean
the
privilege
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
it
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
have
some
relation,
a
state
or
the
united
states
or
a
city
has
to
have
some
relation
to
the
things
in
relation
to
which
an
exaction
is
imposed
that
isn't
barred
by
some
constitutional
principle
either
direct
or
in
this
case
by
the
implication
that
belongs
to
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
you
--
then
please
tell
me
why
you
don't
agree
that
although
uncle
sam
may
own
property
in
defense
in
which
one
uses
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
leases
it
to
a
private
person,
that
a
state
or
a
city
may
enjoy
and
may
tax
the
enjoyment
of
the
lessee
of
property
though
owned
by
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
that
go
on
to
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
an
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
klein
may
i
put
to
you,
continue
the
question
which
you
suggested
a
little
while
ago
and
i
understood
you
to
agree
part
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
the
state
or
the
municipality
could
tax
the
privilege
of
having
a
lease,
is
that
right?
didn't
i
understand
you
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
differentiated
it,
that
in
this
case
they
tax
for
the
whole
value
of
the
property,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
i
just
leave
that
for
him
to
take
care
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
that
is
open,
then
one
goes
to
the
next
step,
the
obvious
next
step,
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
great
scope
of
discretion
to
the
taxing
authority
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
your
friend
on
the
other
side
were
asked,
i'd
like
to
have
you
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
case
murray
should
be
taxable,
does
the
tax
pass
on
to
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
it
was
i
just
want
to
know
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
draw
an
inference
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
difference,
because
on
that
--
from
the
pennsylvania
cases
apart
from
justice
roberts'
expertness
on
the
subject,
the
pennsylvania
laws,
if
that
was
a
tax
on
the
property,
on
the
land
of
(inaudible)
enhanced
by
the
presence
on
the
land,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
it
might
infer
that
whatever
local
taxation
is
involved
would
be
passed
on
to
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
be
true
at
least
as
to
some
of
the
taxes
assessable
against
the
$4
billion
outstanding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
last
statement
looks
suspicious
in
light
that
question
of
state
--
construction
of
a
state
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
if
michigan
as
a
matter
of
state
construction
says
that
which
belongs
to
the
united
states
is
not
taxed,
that
this
construction
of
the
statute,
is
that
right
and
then
they
say
--
so
the
question
here
really
is
whether,
whatever
belonged
--
whether
this
belonged
to
be
united
states,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
did
the
michigan
--
oh
this
is
not.
in
michigan
did
they
give
that
conclusion,
namely
if
it
belongs
a
county
tax,
as
a
matter
of
compulsion,
constitutional
compulsion,
was
that
their
construction
of
the
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
property
distrainable
for
non-payment
--
non-payment
of
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
this
property,
but
in
this
is
the
--
is
the
property
for
which
this
tax
for
getting
the
immunity
problem
distrainable
or
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
was
also
suggest
that
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
it
doesn't
follow
--
it
doesn't
follow,
does
it?
that
because
the
property
is
subject
to
a
tax,
therefore,
it's
distrainable
in
relation
to
the
united
--
if
the
united
states
has
some
interest
in
the
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
not
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
just
want
to
know,
i
had
to
follow
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
a
different
question,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
would
agree
that
what
the
michigan
court
said
as
to
the
nature
of
the
tax,
doesn't
determine
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
incidence
of
the
tax
and
what
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
you
claim
not
merely
a
construction
of
the
contract
which
withdraws
it
from
being
what
is
here
being
called
owned
by
the
government.
but
you
say
that
the
government
contracting
officers
were
not
empowered
to
make
a
contract
which
would
put
the
ownership
whatever
that
may
mean
in
