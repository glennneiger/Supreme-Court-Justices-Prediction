what?
justice

for
what?

against
him
for
what,
on
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
your
tax
is
levied
against?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
levying
it
against
the
company
for
the
property
it
used
or
for
the
action
by
murray
in
doing
business
is
your
state,
now
what
is
the
tax
for,
i
think
that's
what
we
were
trying
to
find
out?
what's
your
contention
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
left
me
a
little
in
doubt
there.
you
said
tax
it
to
the
owner
or
the
one
in
possession.
suppose
that
owner
is
not
in
any
possession
or
that
another
person
is
in
possession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
the
tax
payer,
not
the
owner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
be
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
taxing
possession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
tax
the
other
man
because
he
owns
it,
would
you
have
two
taxes
or
just
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
which
one
under
the
law
you
have
some
(inaudible)
which
one
under
the
law
would
you
tax
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
this
that
(inaudible)?
you're
saying
that
in
michigan
there
is
no
personal
property
tax
is
levied
on
the
owner,
it
is
there,
has
it
in
his
possession
if
you
find
any.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he's
not
there
and
you
can't
find
him
and
you
find
his
property,
you
levied
against
anyone
whose
in
possession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
saying
here
that
the
united
states
government
because
it
is
immune
is
to
be
treated
precisely
as
an
owner
of
property
(inaudible)
who
has
left
the
state
and
you
can't
service
him.
you
can
therefore
put
your
tax
on
the
person
who
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
fisher,
you
take
the
position
again
this
morning
that
their
cities
premised
here,
that
the
government
does
not
own
the
property.
of
course,
if
that's
true,
then
it
is
a
question
not
quite
a
constitutional
question.
now,
have
they
said
that
in
their
brief
that
the
government
does
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
to
put
it
on
that
basis.
