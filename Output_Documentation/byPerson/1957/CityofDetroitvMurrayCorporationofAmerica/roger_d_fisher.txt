mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court?
the
united
states
intervenes
in
this
suit
both
because
of
its
financial
interest
in
the
particular
case,
because
the
property
involved
we
believe
belongs
to
the
united
states
and
was
immune
taxation.
it's
been
estimated
that
about
$4
billion
worth
of
parts,
materials,
of
goods
and
process
are
outstanding
owned
by
the
united
states
under
the
terms
comparable
to
these
at
the
air
force
and
other
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
has
been
estimated
that
there
are
about
$4
billion
worth
of
personal
property
consisting
of
defense
procurement
supplies
which
belonged
to
the
united
states
under
clauses
similar
to
that
here
in
litigation,
that's
all
the
armed
services,
the
figures
obviously
fluctuating
at
all
times,
that's
the
rough
figure
which
is
given
in
the
brief
and
the
authority
for
it
decided
in
the
municipal
brief
amicus
filed
today
or
filed
yesterday.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
on
tax
day
it
was
a
cost
reimbursement
contract
if
terminated.
if
the
tax
has
been
paid
on
tax
assessment
day
with
the
contracts
then
outstanding,
the
full
cost
would
be
borne
by
the
united
states.
the
contract
was
later
changed
as
contemplated
to
a
fixed
price
contract
with
price
redeterminations
forward
and
backward
based
on
cost
experience.
there
has
been
a
price
redetermination
based
on
the
fact
detroit
and
wayne
county
collected
this
tax.
there
were
a
number
of
elements
of
cost
which
murray
came
to
the
united
states
and
said
look
our
costs
are
higher
in
these
respects
then
we
estimated
and
we
think
the
price
ought
to
go
up
so
much,
the
united
states
agreed
on
a
middle
price,
so
certainly
some
of
the
tax
burden
is
being
borne
by
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
would
be
true
as
to
most
presumably
of
the
tax
assessed.
there
are
other
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
as
i
understand
since
in
the
second
world
war
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
was
devised
during
the
second
world
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
put
into
effect
if
i'm
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
during
the
second
world
war
this
clause
was
in
use.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
increasingly,
so
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
the
(inaudible)
one
did
reflect
a
policy
change
following
king
and
booth
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
the
present
clause
now
has
provided
for
in
the
regulations.
there
are
--
appellant
here
make
four,
in
substance
what
are
four
arguments.
first
they
argued
that
this
not
a
property
tax.
i
don't
want
to
quibble
about
words,
the
michigan
statute
which
authorized
the
tax
says
that
property
shall
be
subject
to
taxation,
which
is
the
language
authorizing
tax
and
the
tax
here
not
only
measured
for
the
property
but
because
of
the
property.
i
want
to
meet
a
point
you
raised
mr.
justice
frankfurter
on
the
privilege
of
use.
most
of
the
machine
tools
used
by
murray
in
this
--
all
of
the
machines
tools
i
believe
used
by
murray
in
this
production
are
owned
by
the
united
states.
these
are
being
beneficially
used
by
murray.
they
are
not
being
taxed.
there
is
no
question,
michigan
tax
does
not
apply
to
that.
tools
which
murray
made,
durable
tools
which
murray
made
for
this
job,
in
their
plant,
titles
passed
to
the
united
states,
they're
completed,
they
have
been
inspected
and
accepted,
they
are
being
used
in
the
plant.
they
are
not
been
taxed
by
michigan.
this
tax
is
not
an
enjoyment
of
government
property
tax.
it
could
not
be
so
construed.
it's
a
tax
because
of
property
in
their
possession.
the
same
tax
would
be
imposed
on
a
warehouse
full
of
government
owned
equipment
if
they
thought
the
ownership
was
not
really
in
the
united
states.
the
question
here
under
the
--
as
explained
in
the
court
below
and
as
the
michigan
statute
bears
on
it,
is
are
these
goods
united
states
goods
or
not
and
that
michigan
would
concede
that
if
goods
“belong
to
the
united
states”,
their
tax
does
not
apply.
they
are
so
recognized
with
regard
to
balance
machinery.
their
second
argument
is
that
this
court
should
overrule
a
long
line
of
cases
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
that
the
tax
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
the
question
is
whether
this
property
is
such
an
interest
in
the
united
states,
that
the
united
states
has
such
ownership
interest
in
this
property,
that
michigan
under
the
--
this
is
like
the
post
office,
this
is
like
other
government
owned
property
in
the
possession
of
individuals
who
were
being
paid,
the
post
master
gets
paid,
their
tax
could
be
assessed
on
the
post
master's
private
capacity,
because
they
are
using
the
post
office
building,
he
is
doing
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
murray
is
here
making
goods,
doing
work,
doing
the
government's
business
with
government
property.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
it's
their
constructional
constitutional
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
compulsion
i
would
suppose,
but
they
do
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
do
not
know,
mr.
taylor
is
there
a
provision
in
your
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'm
advised
as
to
real
property
there
is,
as
to
personal
property
is
it
not.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
is
not.
the
tax
here
is
because
of
the
property,
it's
not
because
of
anything
else
relating
to
it,
and
that's
when
i
say
it's
not
a
question
of
what
michigan
says,
it's
what
they
do,
and
this
tax
is
because
of
property,
if
there
is
some
property
there
they
tax
it,
and
they
are
not
taxing
the
privilege
of
beneficial
use,
they
don't
see
whether
you're
enjoying
the
property
or
whether
you're
merely
having
a
storage,
these
goods
in
process
were
not
being
enjoyed,
they
were
being
worked
on.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
said
that
there
were
four
main
points
raised
by
the
appellants,
petitioners
in
this
case.
first,
some
question
about
whether
this
is
the
tax
on
property
or
on
the
person.
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
this
is
the
common
garden
variety
of
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax.their
argument
is
not
direct
to
the
point.
this
statute
is
different
from
any
other
statute.
there
is
--
the
thrust
of
their
argument
is
that
it's
the
person
who
paid
the
tax,
not
the
property
and
that
the
tax
is
not
on
the
property.
but
it
is
the
common
garden
variety
it's
one
of
the
oldest
statutes
on
the
books
in
michigan
and
detroit
and
this
is
the
personal
property
ad
valorem
tax.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
stated
the
general
property
generally
is
under
their
tax.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
in
this
case,
on
the
books
in
detroit,
they
said
subject
to
whatever
the
interests
of
the
united
states
are
or
some
statement
of
that
kind
on
the
register.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
believe
it
is,
yes.
yes,
i've
no
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
it
wouldn't
necessary
follow.
i
want
to
get
the
kind
of
tax
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
are
--
they
are
different
questions.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
but
what
we're
dealing
with,
the
tax
we're
dealing
is
a
plain
old
personal
property
ad
valorem
tax.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
to
my
understanding
of
its
decisions
is
this
is
that
tax.
now,
on
--
in
connection
with
the
particular
case
as
to
when
you
can
collect
from
a
husband
for
a
wife
in
this
property
--
of
for
property
in
his
wife's
possession,
they
kind
of
said
what
the
tax
is
on.
but
it
--
it
is
the
general
personal
property
tax
throughout
michigan.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
but
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
tax
is
because
of
property
measured
by
the
property
as
a
property
tax.
the
second
suggestion
they
made
to
this
court
is
that
you
might
you
reconsider
the
allegheny
and
kern-limerick
cases
and
that
therefore,
if
you
just
--
if
you
overruled
or
limited
those
cases,
you
might
hold
for
them
here.
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
this
is
--
would
require
not
only
overruling
allegheny
and
kern-limerick,
but
if
they're
correct
if
we
are
correct,
the
united
states
owned
this
property.
their
position
would
require
overruling
100
years
of
cases
saying
that
property
of
the
united
states
is
not
subject
to
a
personal
property
ad
valorem
tax.
we
think
that
congress
which
has
legislated
in
this
field
for
100
years
based
on
the
assumption
that
government-owned
property
is
not
subject
to
a
personal
property
tax,
should
make
any
changes
of
this
kind.
congress
had
the
power
and
it
would
be
a
--
upsetting
ruling
to
reverse
the
100
years
of
decisions.
the
third
argument
is
that
the
united
states
executive
branch
has
no
authority
to
acquire
material
or
semi
completed
goods.
they
argue
that
the
executive
branch
does
not
have
--
it's
prevented
by
the
revised
statute
which
they
cite,
requiring
material
or
goods
that
are
not
completed
items.
we
believe
this
argument
is
wholly
without
merits,
that
their
argument
really
turns
on
their
conclusion
that
the
united
states
did
not
own
the
property.
they
say
this
is
an
advanced
--
and
advanced
payments
are
prohibited.
if
the
united
states
actually
acquired
all
the
own
--
incidents
of
ownership,
the
bulk
of
the
bundle
of
rights
in
this
property,
their
argument
would
be
if
united
states
cannot
buy
materials
which
is
clearly
wrong,
that
we
cannot
buy
uncompleted
items
has
been
well
settled
since
ansonia
where
the
united
states
bought
a
vessel
in
the
process
of
completion
making
payments
of
10%,
20%
and
so
forth.
but
the
vessel
throughout
the
stage
belonged
to
the
united
states
at
least
as
against
a
lien
of
any
state
property
supplier.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
--
i
think,
i
can
clarify
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
i
can.
they
--
their
contention
is
that
the
title
interest
which
the
united
states
passed
is
a
security
interest
and
their
--
i
think
it
has
clarified
their
position
and
the
issue
which
i
believe
is
before
the
court,
to
indicate
the
two
cases
which
they
chiefly
relied
on
this
point,
are
the
new
brunswick
case
in
276
u.s.
and
s.r.a.
against
minnesota.
these
are
cases,
the
first
one
where
united
states
sold
property,
homes
to
buyers.
when
they
paid
10%,
they
were
to
acquire
title.
the
united
states
was
to
convey
the
title.
the
united
states
wrongly
refused
to
convey
the
title
after
the
payments
were
made.
new
brunswick
imposed
the
tax
on
the
property.
this
court
held
that
the
owners,
the
buyers
of
that
property
were
the
equitable
owners
and
that
even
though
the
united
states
held
the
legal
title
because
it
has
refused
to
convey
a
deed,
the
property
was
subject
to
tax
since
all
the
possessory
rights,
everything
was
in
the
purchasers
except
the
united
states'
legal
title.
in
s.r.a.
against
--
incorporated
against
minnesota
in
327
u.s.,
a
similar
situation
existed.
the
property
had
been
sold
by
the
united
states.
it
kept
the
title
however,
throughout
the
payments
for
its
security,
as
security
against
the
payments
which
were
to
be
made
in
installments.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
i've
--
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
agree
entirely
and
i
believe
the
entire
case
turns
on
a
construction
of
this
contract
as
a
whole
to
see
whether
the
united
states
has
merely
a
bare
legal
title,
which
the
contract
obviously
gives
us,
or
whether
we
really
have
substantial
ownership
interests
such
as
to
make
this
in
effect
and
in
substance,
property
of
the
united
states.
i
will
turn
to
that
point.
with
the
first
thing
to
realize,
seems
to
me,
is
that
this
is
custom-made
property.
these
parts
of
jet
engines
and
parts
of
aircraft
assemblies
which
the
murray
corporation
are
making,
are
of
no
use
to
anybody
except
the
united
states.
murray
corporation
cannot
dispose
of
a
specification
rear
bearing
(inaudible)
for
a
combat
jet
airplane
engine
to
anybody
else.
it's
as
though
i
went
to
a
tailor.
i
bought
a
bolt
of
cloth
from
him.
i
paid
him
for
it.
we
agreed
in
writing
that
i
was
to
have
title
to
own
the
cloth.
i
then
asked
the
--
the
tailor
to
make
me
a
suit.
now,
i
submit
that
i
could
own
that
suit
in
process
of
manufacture,
but
that
is
in
substance
what
this
is.
and
that
the
basic
right
which
murray
has
here
to
decide
what
is
scrap
and
to
keep
scrap
is
the
same
right
that
tailor
would
have
--
could
have
by
agreement
that
he
could
keep
the
remnants
that
were
left
over
after
the
suit
has
been
made.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
with
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
does
not
--
what
one
exception,
your
honor,
that
these
were,
by
the
terms
not
advanced
payments.
these
were
partial
payments,
progress
payments
and
not
in
the
nature
of
an
advance.
there
was
no
interest
on
them.
they
could
not
pay
them
back.
we
--
and
the
fact
the
figure
was
as
much
out
of
line
as
of
january
1st,
1952,
only
reflects
the
fact
that
this
contract
was
just
getting
going.
but
six
months
later,
murray
corporation
owned
some
$16
million
worth
of
--
or
had
acquired
--
had
four
works
in
process.
some
$16
million
of
which
the
united
states
had
bought
from
--
had
bought
them
and
to
which
we
paid
some
$15
million.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
--
that
--
that's
correct.
it
leas
to
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
there
are
this
--
i
think
there's
--
are
some
misunderstanding
in
this
and
some
misstatements
of
the
two
of
the
are
unintentional,
i'm
sure,
of
some
of
the
relevant
clauses
in
this
and
i
think
if
i
could
spell
it
out
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
in
some
detail,
your
honor,
it
may
help.
the
purpose
of
this
clause
was
one
of
substance.
the
united
--
it
stipulated
in
the
record
86,
that
the
--
in
the
primary
contract
into
which
this
clause
was
inserted
that
neither
parties,
the
negotiating
parties
that's
in
the
prime
contracts,
air
force,
kaiser
and
wright,
did
not
consider
possible
avoidance
of
city
and
county
taxes
as
an
element
in
their
decision.
that's
on
record
85
and
record
86.
the
--
the
basic
consideration
was
that
the
contractor
needed
the
money.
he
wanted
to
sell
these
goods
and
the
desire
of
the
air
force
to
maintain
control
of
material
and
work
in
process
during
the
life
of
the
contract
so
that
such
material
could
be
moved
elsewhere
in
the
event
of
nonperformance.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
would
be
a
foreclosure
and
there's
no
debt.
this
--
this
is
not
a
security
interest,
your
honor,
because
there's
no
debt
to
secure.
we
have
some
special
parts
that
murray
is
working
on.
murray
doesn't
owe
any
money.
it's
not
a
case
of
us
having
sold
something
and
waiting
for
payment.
we're
not
going
to
be
paid
anything.
we
have
the
parts.
you
would
see
even
this
in
material.
now,
these
materials
when
it
was
suggested
yesterday,
that
this
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
contractor
as
to
whether
we
shall
--
he
shall
get
a
part
payment
or
not.
simply,
he
changes
title
if
he
wants
to
get
some
money,
then
he's
tax-exempt.
on
the
contrary,
murray
corporation
bought
a
lot
of
material.
maybe
it's
$2
million
worth
of
materials.
they
were
engaged
in
large
industrial
enterprise
themselves.
material
was
in
scarce
supply,
was
short.
when
they
got
a
part
payment,
they
sold
this
material
to
the
united
states.
it
was
earmarked,
labeled
u.s.
property,
kept
apart
and
they
had
no
right
to
use
any
of
it
for
their
own
operation.
they
could
not
take
a
nut
or
a
bolt
out
of
the
bins
labeled
united
states
property
and
use
it
for
their
own
operations
regardless
of
what
they
paid
us
for
it
or
what
they
agreed
to
pay
for
it.
it
became
the
government
property.but
that
we've
--
the
contractor
needed
funds,
the
united
states
wanted
absolute
control
because
the
parts,
the
aircraft
engine
parts
were
classified
the
security
restriction
posed
on
the
parts
of
these
jet
engines.
we
did
not
want
to
have
to
go
through
a
local
foreclosure
procedure
having
a
mortgage.
if
there
was
a
strike
or
insolvency,
nonperformance
or
bad
performance,
or
if
simply,
we
had
a
higher
priority
project
somewhere
else,
we
could
take
materials
from
murray,
delivered
to
other
--
with
other
contractor
regardless
to
the
effect
on
murray's
operations.
and
we
did
that
in
this
very
case.
it
stipulated
that
the
parts,
property
of
the
united
states
in
the
possession
of
murray
was
to
direction
of
the
united
states
sent
to
other
manufacturers,
other
contractors
for
air
force.
this
clause
is
not
based
on
kern-limerick
tax
consideration
consequence.
the
tax
that
here
involved
was
two
years
before
the
kern-limerick
decision.
now,
the
--
this
property
was
treated
by
murray
as
belonging
to
the
united
states.
it
was
not
carried
on
their
inventory.
it
was
segregated,
labeled,
marked,
set
apart.
and
none
of
the
material
which
they
acquired
was
used
by
murray
in
any
way
or
the
--
the
appellants
rely
on
four
factors
which
they
think
to
sshow
that
murray
corporation
really
owned
this
property.
the
first
of
these
is
scrap.
murray
was
authorized
on
the
record
--
in
the
murray
--
in
the
kaiser
sub-contract
was
on
record
176.
they
were
authorized
--
the
current
--
the
current
production
of
scrap
may
be
sold
by
the
contractor
without
approval
of
the
contracting
officer.
proceed
would
be
credit
to
the
united
states.
the
--
we
submit,
that
delegating
the
man
who
was
making
this
tool,
making
these
parts
to
decide
when
he's
(inaudible)
when
he
can
scrap
it.
it's
a
reasonable
delegation
every
time
one
of
us
takes
his
car
to
the
garage
and
say,
“would
you
please
fix
the
spark
plugs
or
fix
the
carburetor,
we
delegate,
impliedly
authorize
the
mechanic
to
throw
away
or
scrap
parts
that
he
finds
are
no
good,
fix
it
up.he
doesn't
even
credit
us
with
the
scrap
price.
i
did
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
murray
has
no
such
authorization.
current
production
scrap
is
a
standard
which
can
be
defined
and
we
can
tell
whether
a
part
is
scrap
or
whether
its
not.
murray
who
was
making
these
parts
to
sell
--
to
receive
the
balance
of
the
contract
price,
murray
must
finish
the
parts.the
contract
price
is
about
--
usually
scrap
runs
around
2%
of
what
the
contract
calls
for.
if
murray
is
not
going
to
scrap,
sell
and
credit
to
united
states
in
scrap
prices,
parts
that
are
in
fact
good.
there's
no
interest
there,
so
we
have
inspectors,
government
inspectors
are
there.
the
machine
tools
they
are
using
are
government
owned.
we
--
we're
--
we
have
inspector
and
inspectors,
we're
on
the
--
there's
a
--
scrap
is
a
standard
which
we
believe
is
reasonable
and
it's
not
an
unlimited
delegation
to
say
something
is
scrap
which
is
not
scrap.
i
might
actually
point
out
that
in
the
operations
of
its
contract
as
is
stipulated
in
the
record,
murray
always
got
the
government
approval
before
disposing
of
any
scrap.
again
reflecting,
this
is
the
practical
operation.
this
property
was
considered
government
property.
it
was
labeled
that.
the
workers
were
--
knew
that.
now,
before
the
stipulations
were
obtained,
this
is
not
just
the
hypothetical
case,
counsel
went
through
that.
and
both
sides
went
through
the
--
planned
in
some
detail
and
they
were
satisfied
to
be
--
or
these
is
the
fact
of
the
situation,
where
this
is
--
that
this
is
the
case.
now,
the
second
consideration
to
which
appellants
rely
is
the
risk
of
loss.
they
said
the
fact
that
the
contract
put
the
risk
of
loss
on
murray
shows
that
murray
was
the
owner
of
these
goods.
the
--
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
ansonia
case
where
the
ship
was
being
built,
the
contract
with
the
united
states
similarly
puts
the
risk
of
loss
on
the
contractor
as
you
or
i
might
do,
if
you
left
our
suit
was
to
be
--
a
suit
to
be
made,
to
be
finished
or
take
our
watch
to
the
dealer
would
assume
that
he
was
going
to
have
insurance
on
any
loss
that
occurs
to
your
property
while
bailed
to
him.
i
might
point
out
that
the
insurance
contract
in
which
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
that
is
the
fourth
point.
i'll
come
right
to
it
now.
its
one
of
the
four
considerations
to
which
--
which
appellants
relied.
they
say
the
murray
corporation
has
the
right
to
get
the
title
back.
now,
there
--
there
are
two
--
this
is
--
this
is
critical,
i
think,
and
i
believe
they
misunderstand
the
contract
in
one
critical
respect.
appellants
state
in
their
brief,
how
this
clause
operates
which
is
unfortunately
incorrect.
they
say,
"but
the
provision
of
this
contract
permits
the
government
title
--
i'm
reading
from
page
64,
appellants'
brief
--
"permits
the
government
title
to
revest
in
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
as
soon
as
the
government
has
been
delivered
goods
equivalent
to
the
value
of
its
investment
therein.
this
assumes
that
deliveries
under
the
contract
are
applied
first
to
the
partial
payments."
so
that
if,
that
the
example
i
gave
on
page
65
with
partial
payments
were
equal
to
20
--
a
quarter
of
the
total
contract
price
and
as
soon
as
goods
have
been
delivered
to
a
quarter
of
the
price,
they
contend
that
the
title
would
revest
back
or
vest
--
would
go
with
vest
into
the
murray
corporation.
and
that
is
one
of
the
major
things
upon
which
they
rely.
it
comes
from
a
misreading
of
the
contract.
the
clause
controlling
this
appears
on
page
175
of
the
record,
it
is
subparagraph
(c),
immediately
preceding
subparagraph
(d).
in
making
payments
for
the
second
payment
for
the
supplies
furnished
hereunder,
there
shall
be
deducted
from
the
contract
price
therefore,
a
proportionate
amount
of
the
partial
payments
theretofore
made
to
the
contractor
under
the
authority
herein
contained.
a
proportionate
amount,
so
that
if
we
have
paid
25%
of
the
--
if
by
partial
payments,
we
have
paid
25%
of
the
contract
price
for
the
finished
items,
that
he
should
deliver
25%
or
deliver
a
certain
portion
of
the
--
a
number
of
items
being
delivered.
the
partial
payments
would
be
reduced
in
proportion
so
we
would
still
have
a
partial
payment
of
25%
outstanding
on
the
balance
of
the
property
and
it
would
not
revest.
the
only
way
that
--
that
the
--
the
only
way
the
murray
corporation
can
get
title
back
is
upon
completing
the
contract,
delivering
every
item
which
it
is
--
which
is
provided.
he
then
gets
title
to
the
scraps,
the
remnants
and
the
jigs
or
consumable
tools
which
are
worth
nothing
by
hypothesis.
if
their
excess
materials
were
not
necessary
to
the
contract
and
he
gets,
they
come
back.
if
they
were
consumable
tools
which
are
not
durable
tools
and
which
are
--
or
value
only
the
contract
and
are
worthless,
he
keeps
them.
the
--
these
tools
are
typically
a
piece
of
steel
pipe,
welded
on
to
something
so
it'd
hold
each
part
right
in
rigid
place
as
they're
working
on
it.
this
jig
or
consumable
tool
is
worth
nothing
once
that
specifications
have
been
changed
and
you
produce
a
different
part.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
only
--
there's
the
--
i'll
see
if
i
make
my
point
clear,
your
honor.
there
are
--
upon
liquidation
of
all
partial
payments
hereunder,
or
upon
completion
of
deliveries.
now,
upon
completion
of
deliveries,
i
believe
you
would
--
would
agree
that
that
--
if
they
delivered
everything
the
contract
calls
for,
then
all
that
is
left
are
scraps
and
non-things
that
were
not
required
by
the
contract.
things
that
they
produced
that
were
not
--
not
needed
to
produce
for
the
contract.
so,
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
this
--
this
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
materials
leftover
that
were
--
there
were
in
fact
not
necessary
for
the
contract.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
turned
out
in
fact
not
to
be
necessary,
if
i
may
--
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
at
the
time
this
contract
--
its
letter
contracts
were
in
effect,
there
was
the
termination
clause.
there
was
no
final
contract.
there
was
no
price
fixed.
these
were
cost
contracts.
if
termination
occurred
before
a
definitive
contract
had
been
made,
the
united
states
would
pay
them
their
total
cost
and
would
take
everything
that
was
there.
that's
the
termination
provision,
under
that
contract,
if
they
were
terminated
at
that
time.
they'
then
were
changed
over
to
a
fixed
price,
definitive
contract
in
effect,
after
the
tax
they
--
here
involved.
this
--
this
clause
is
--
the
--
that
this
is
a
clause
from
the
--
a
typical
definitive
contract,
which
is
put
into
the
letter
of
contract
and
speaks
upon
completion
of
the
contract
which
is
a
completion
of
the
final
--
all
the
items
required.
but
before
that
time,
they
had
a
fixed
price.
it
was
a
fixed
price
contract,
so
that
your
price
pre-determination
is
based
on
forward,
based
on
cost
experience.
the
--
the
price
was
fixed
based
on
an
estimated
cost.
if
the
contractor,
this
is
an
incentive
fixed
price
contract,
its
incentive
contract
to
keep
the
contract,
they're
trying
to
keep
cost
as
low
as
it
can.
if
the
contractor
here
could
use
less
material,
less
aluminum,
if
he
could
more
efficiently
stamp
out
the
tail
surfaces
for
these
jet
planes
and
end
up
with
a
stack
of
aluminum
sheets,
that
is
part
of
his
profit.
this
was
a
part
of
the
cost
incentive
plan
on
a
fix
price
arrangements,
so
that
he
would
get
back
any
savings
he
could
make
on
the
materials
were
an
element
of
his
profit
and
a
title
revested
to
the
supplies
that
were
left
over
in
the
contract.
now,
the
more
closely
a
contractor
could
estimate
what
was
going
to
be
needed
the
less
he
would
put
in
the
government
bins
where
he
had
no
control
over
for
a
six
months
or
a
two-year
period
and
then
he
could
only
get
it
back
later.
materials
were
scarce,
high
priority
items
and
he
would
not
have
to
put
them
to
the
--
he
would
not
have
to
put
title
to
the
government
by
selling
them
to
the
government
if
he
thought
they
were
not
necessary
for
the
contract.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
contract
provides
that
material
--
and
it's
the
clause
which
mr.
taylor,
it
worried
him
a
little,
the
materials
are
properly
and
things
are
properly
allocated
to
the
contract.
we
have
government
inspectors
there
examining
this.
if
they
have
obtained
more
material
and
is
properly
allocated
to
the
contract,
they
will
not
be
paid,
the
partial
payment
on
that
and
the
contract
is
not
provided.
if
and
--
if
they've
overestimated
and
it's
not
caught
by
inspectors
and
we
find
that
there
seems
to
be
more
aluminum
here,
the
united
states
material
is
being
critically
short,
time
of
this
when
they
are
going
to
buy,
would
take
that
material
and
give
it
to
other
contractors
working
for
the
united
states,
who
needed
more.
we
have
absolute
power.
to
wit,
the
murray
corporation
could
not
acquire
this
for
themselves.
they
could
not
dispose
off
to
others
except
with
our
consent.
at
no
time,
in
this
contract
was
our
consent
given.
now,
at
--
on
that
point
the
wisconsin
case,
american
motors
--
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
construed
that
clause
as
only
giving
us
control
over
the
price
and
they
said
--
they
quoted
that
that
is
the
section
on
176
that
they
that
which
gives
murray
corporation
the
right
to
acquire
or
dispose
off
property
to
its
title
in
the
government
upon
terms
approved
by
the
contracting
officer.
they
construed
that
by
giving
us
only
control
over
the
price.
that
is
not
the
way
it's
been
construed
by
either
party
and
the
clause
on
scrap
which
merely
follows
it
that
says
they
can
sell
scrap
without
approval,
indicates
that
this
clause
is
total
approval.
and
we
certainly
would
not
allow
them
to
sell
scarce
materials
required
in
this
contract
simply
because
they
can
get
a
premium
price
for
it.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
in
this
fashion.
the
--
we
have
bought
these
goods
under
our
theory
and
anyone's
theory,
we
have
the
title
--
legal
title
to
them.
we
have
substantial
rights
over
them
and
we
have
paid
a
price
based
on
the
then
cost.
when
the
goods
are
completed,
we
must
pay
them
a
price
based
upon
the
fixed
price
agreed
or
at
the
time
of
the
interim
arrangement
if
they
never
finished
any
items,
of
course,
before
the
definitive
contract
was
made.
that
the
price
we
would
pay
would
be
the
contract
price.
now,
if
i
bought
my
cloth,
my
bolt
of
cloth
from
the
tailor.
i
paid
him
90%
of
the
cost
for
that
bolt
of
cloth.
i
took
the
title
to
it.
we
agreed
i
was
to
own,
i
could
take
it
away
if
i
had
wanted
to.
he
didn't
get
on
with
the
suit.
i
could
take
that
cloth
to
somebody
else.
i'll
leave--
i'll
leave
the
cloth
with
him
and
he
finishes
the
suit.
the
suit
costs
more
than
the
cloth.
when
i
pay
him
for
the
final
job,
i
pay
him
the
price
for
the
suit
less
what
i've
already
paid
him
because
i
bought
the
cloth.
and
if
we
pay
them
here,
the
contract
price
for
the
item
less
a
proportionate
amount
of
the
partial
payments
based
on
their
cost
at
the
time
they
requested
it.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if,
whatever
the
price
of
the
goods.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
isn't.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
because
you
--
under
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
under
the
contract
here,
the
murray
corporation
could
receive
up
to
90%
of
their
cost,
90%
of
the
contract
price.
it
happens
that
this
--
this
contract
started
in
the
summer
of
1951
and
was
rapidly
expanded.
they
have
$2
million
worth
of
goods
by
january
1st.
they
had
$16
million
worth
six
months
later.
at
the
time
of
tax
date,
the
partial
payment
they
have
requested
were
only
for
25%
--
about
20%
of
the
cost
as
of
that
day.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
30%
of
bolt
of
cloth.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
which
is
all
they'd
have
for
as
of
the
day.
they
had
the
right
and
as
soon
as
the
paperwork
was
done,
they
quickly
exercised
that
right
and
received
90%
of
the
bolt
of
--
price
of
my
bolt
cloth
or
90%
of
their
cost.
you
see,
just
about
80%
and
90%.
they
--
you're
exercising
right
at
the
edge.
this
was
an
expensive
contract,
million
of
dollars
and
no
--
in
murray
corporation
or
anyone
else
is
going
to
sell
his
materials
to
the
united
states
and
not
get
as
soon
as
he
can
as
much
as
he's
entitled
to
get
for
that
sale.
the
--
the
point
that
seems
critical
here
is
that
the
tax
incidence
falls
if
the
united
--
this
court
has
held.
if
the
united
states
only
has
a
lien,
security
title.
here,
by
contract,
whatever
we
had
paid
or
there
nothing.
if
we
agreed
to
take
the
title,
i
believe
we
could
take
the
title
and
if
we
agreed,
we
would
have
the
right
to
take
that
bolt
of
cloth
or
take
this
material,
put
them
where
we
wanted
to
take
them
for
other
contract,
this
is
an
integrator
for
higher
security
--
for
higher
priority
projects.
we
had
absolute
control
over
these
materials.
we
had
inspectors
there.
they
were
labeled
as
government
property.
they
were
more
clearly
government
property,
and
the
machine
tools
on
which
he
was
working,
which
detroit
conceived
are
government
property
and
not
taxable.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
put
it
this
way
i
believe
the
united
states
can
buy
on
credit
and
if
we
buy,
take,
exercise,
control
over
and
own
a
post
office
building,
airplane
park
and
we'd
agreed
the
final
price
to
be
paid
a
year
later
and
a
--
the
contractor
says
that's
“all
right”
or
we
take
books
and
the
sellers
says,
“pay
me
in
--
in
60
days,”
that
if
tax
day
came
in
between
time
and
nothing
had
been
paid
on
those,
they
will
be
government
property
depending
upon
the
rights
which
the
united
states
had
over
them.
we
exercise
these
rights
in
the
interest
of
national
defense.
these
were
substantive
rights
or
reasons
the
government
to
do
with
the
production
of
aircraft.
we
wanted
power.
we
--
we've
provided
the
contract.
we
would
have
power
over
these
goods.
and
we
believe
these
are
as
clearly
the
property
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
not
subject
to
local
ad
valorem
taxes
as
any
other
property
of
united
states.
