mr.
rampton,
may
i
--
do
i
correctly
get
you
on
your
use
of
this
exhibit
64
is
merely
to
show
that
that
is
a
difference
in
density
which
establishes
the
necessity
to
make
a
case
for
the
railroads
to
make
a
case
--
justice

stewart
--
of
proving
either
identity
and
densities
or
not
such
a
different
as
that
--
it
can
make
a
difference
in
the
result.
in
other
words
you're
not
giving
us
this
chart
or
referring
to
it,
to
prove
any
case
on
your
behalf,
are
you,
beyond
that
they
should
have
included
as
a
factor
to
make
out
a
case.

justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
weston
(voice
overlap)
you're
here
as
i
recall
it
on
milwaukee-chicago
suburban
case,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
that
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
remember
that
one
the
--
all
of
the
evidence
went
to
a
breakdown
of
revenues
and
expenses
on
the
suburban
traffic
as
suppose
to
interstate.
and
i
supposed
there
that's
because
they
don't
carry
this.
