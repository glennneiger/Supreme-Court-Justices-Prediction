mr.
keith
sohm
i'm
glad
to
say
that
we
have
no
difficulty
on
the
density
problem.
mr.
keith
sohm
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
weston
i
think
mentioned
in
great
detail
and
the
first
part
of
this
testimony,
i
mean
the
argument
of
mr.
calvin,
excuse
me,
mentioned
in
great
detail
on
the
fist
part
of
his
argument
and
it
seemed
to
infer
all
of
it
that
the
only
thing
they
think
is
necessary
is
to
show
that
there
is
substantial
conditions
that
are
the
same
in
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce.
we
submit
that
they
did
not
so
do
and
came
far
from
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
because
much
of
the
utah
evidence
introduced
shows
that
the
rates,
in
a
lot
of
instances
in
intrastate
commerce
was
higher
than
rates
on
in
--
interstate
commerce
in
similar
conditions
and
similar
situations.
this
was
observed
by
the
honorable
judge
christensen
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
when
he
dissented
from
the
majority
decision
--
circuit
court
and
district
court
excuse
me,
when
he
stated
this.
other
evidential
matters
mentioned
in
the
prevailing
opinion
as
a
foundation
for
the
commission's
conclusion
are
belief
insufficient
to
permit
possible
inferences
to
that
effect
in
view
of
the
record
as
a
whole.
such
disparity
of
rates
as
were
shown
are
in
both
directions
and
it
is
well
established
that
a
mere
disparity
of
rates
establishes
no
sufficient
basis
for
such
an
order.
we
recognize
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
a
disparity
rates
but
the
disparity
was
of
course
in
both
directions,
some
of
them
in
favor
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
some
otherwise.
now,
an
argument,
mr.
collins
mentioned
that
there
was
a
saving
clause
which
was
suppose
to
protect
the
state
commission
in
case
any
rates
where
slightly
higher
in
intrastate
commerce
than
in
interstate
commerce
and
we
submit
that
that
saving
clause
has
no
effect
and
gives
us
no
advantage
because
the
principal
number
of
rates
and
the
principal
structure
of
rates
within
the
state
of
course.
it
is
impossible
to
identify
similar
circumstances
and
similar
instances
under
which
we
can
take
advantage
of
that
saving
clause
so
that
with
the
exception
of
very
few
instances
that
saving
clause
has
no
effect
or
no
advantage
to
the
public
service
commission
of
utah
and
the
rates
within
the
state
of
utah.
now,
we
have
no
argument
with
the
railroads
and
we're
not
attempting
to
frustrate
the
court
nor
the
interstate
commerce
commission
though
i
may
admit
we
probably
frustrated
the
railroads
to
a
short
degree
because
we
haven't
fallen
in
line
with
all
of
the
states
that
have
been
asking
for
increases,
all
of
the
states
that
have
denied
or
granted
these
increases
for
instance.
on
november
or
october
the
10th,
1957,
the
--
alabama
commission
granted
an
increase
in
rates
that
was
petitioned
before
them
by
the
railroads
and
this
is
the
--
in
granting
it,
they
state
this.
“it
is
with
reluctance
and
a
definite
misgiving
that
we
authorize
the
sought
increase.”
nevertheless,
we
cannot
ignore
the
strong
compelling
consideration
of
the
ever
threatening
mess
to
our
power
in
jurisdiction
and
existence
of
the
federal
statute
books
of
the
13th
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
rights
of
the
state
of
alabama
as
well
as
other
individual
states
to
regulate
the
intrastate
general
rate
level
according
to
its
best
judgment
has
been
all
but
negated
by
federal
encroachment
under
the
strained
and
continue
--
continually
broadening
construction
of
the
provision
of
federal
law.
we
just
haven't
been
quite
as
remiss
in
allowing
railroads
to
take
over
our
rates
had
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
the
alabama
and
other
commission's
have.
now,
we
haven't
then
unfair
with
the
railroads.
in
this
last
case
in
which
they're
appealing
from
now,
we
held
a
hearing,
asked
them
for
evidence
to
prove
that
they
needed
this
increase
and
they
failed
to
produce
it
so
we
left
the
record
open.
they
left
the
record
open
as
they
stated
for
60
days
but
instead
ended
up
by
living
record
open
for
three
years.
they're
asking
the
railroads
to
comeback
and
give
us
some
evidence
and
show
us
where
you
need
these
rates
in
the
state
of
utah
and
they
did
not
so
do.
there's
lots
of
--
lots
of
problems
suggested
that
are
complicated
and
involved
by
the
arguments
and
the
briefs
on
both
sides
in
this
case
but
it's
fundamental.
and
i
think
your
honors
can
appreciate
that,
that
this
railroad
whether
it's
in
an
interstate
commerce
commission
proceeding
where
the
interstate
commerce
commission
initiates
the
proceeding
upon
petition
by
the
railroads
or
whether
it's
a
railroad
case
before
the
state
commission
that
they've
got
to
make
a
case
and
they've
got
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
they
need
these
rates
in
the
state
of
utah
and
that
the
state
of
utah
is
not
bearing
its
fair
share
of
the
interstate
and
the
overall
revenues
of
the
railroads.
they
did
not
so
make
a
prima
facie
case
and
carry
that
burden
of
proof
and
as
counsel
for
the
appellants
have
argued
the
first
instance,
stated,
the
utah
commission,
when
he
state
further
--
step
further
and
did
introduced
evidence
to
show
that
in
many
instances
the
rates
in
the
state
of
utah
are
already
higher
that
the
--
the
density
was
higher
and
therefore
of
a
greater
benefit
to
the
railroads
that
the
--
and
i
refer
to
the
brief
of
counsel
in
this
matter
that
the
ton
mile
figures
as
a
matter
of
fact.
in
the
record,
page
116,
an
analysis
of
the
revenue
for
ton
mile
produced
by
the
utah
commission
statistical
expert
show
--
break
--
brought
down
the
products
into
manufactured
and
miscellaneous
agriculture,
animals,
and
mines.
and
showed
that
the
total
of
these
products
in
intrastate
was
produced
a
revenue
for
ton
mile
of
$1.21.
in
interstate
it
produced
a
revenue
of
$1.06.
the
railroads
have
produced
a
ton
mile
study
of
their
own
and
introduced
it
in
the
record
in
page
99.
and
that
they
have
taken
the
overall
of
the
whole
united
states
to
show
what
the
revenue
for
ton
mile
was.
they
have
taken
the
western
district
and
they
have
taken
the
figure
in
connection
with
utah
to
show
what
the
ton
mile
figures
are.
we
submit
that
the
--
that
the
railroads
not
only
have
failed
to
carry
their
burden
of
proof
but
they
have
--
but
we
have
already
actually
taken
the
burden
and
shown
that
they
should
not
have
the
increases
within
the
state
of
utah
and
that
if
they
did
so
have
them,
they
would
be
discriminating
against
the
intrastate
commerce.
in
the
railroads
position
that
they
should
have
automatically
an
increase
the
same
as
and
identical
to
that
increase
granted
on
interstate
commerce
commission
is
an
absurdity
to
presume
that
the
conditions
within
the
state
of
utah
are
identical
to
the
conditions
in
alabama
for
instance
or
the
conditions
in
new
york.
and
that
they
--
the
exact
amount
of
increase
should
be
imposed
upon
utah
as
in
those
areas.
for
instance
in
the
original
case
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
investigation
in
which
time
they
actually
imposed
this
15%
increase,
their
order
called
ex
parte
175.
three
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
commissioners
joined
in
a
dissent
and
they
stated
this,
it
was
written
by
atchison.
“i
cannot
agree
that
the
revenue
needs
of
the
petitioning
railroads
and
all
three
great
territories
are
so
equal
as
to
warrant
a
uniform
nationwide
increase
in
rates.
and
that
same
commissioner,
i'm
sure
would
look
at
this
thing
and
say,
“no.
i
can't
understand
and
i
can't
agree
that
the
needs
of
all
of
the
railroads
throughout
the
united
states
is
equal
and
exact
than
all
of
the
states
of
the
union
that
utah
has
to
be
exactly
the
same
as
these
others
that
the
uniform
rate
increase
on
other
states
is
not
necessarily
the
particular
rate
increase
that
should
be
imposed
upon
the
state
of
utah.
it's
time
to
say
that
our
little
tulare
valley
railroad
in
salt
lake,
in
utah
or
the
bamberger
railroad
in
utah
has
to
have
and
has
the
exact
revenue
needs
that
new
york
central
has
that
that
obviously
is
not
true.
the
railroads
gave
us
no
evidence
upon
which
we
could
really
determine
what
the
revenue
needs
were
of
the
railroads
in
utah
as
distinguished
from
the
railroads
that
are
out
of
the
united
states.
the
railroads
gave
no
evidence
of
their
cost
of
operation
in
utah
as
compared
to
the
revenues
in
utah.
they
did
state
that
we
need
$1,860,000
in
order
to
--
to
make
the
operations
in
utah
and
bring
us
a
fair
return
but
that's
like
an
employees
saying
to
his
employer
that
last
year
if
you
had
given
me
15%
increase,
i
will
donate
1000
more
dollars.
and
therefore
i'm
losing
$1000.
therefore
this
year
given
15%
increase
in
my
wages
so
that
i
won't
lose
$1000
this
year.
it's
not
evidence.
it's
a
conclusion
and
a
finding.
the
carriers
in
the
west
by
evidence
is
shown
in
the
exhibits
are
in
a
more
favorable
position
than
the
carriers
in
the
east.
the
illustration
given
by
the
counsel
in
the
first
argument,
mr.
rampton
showed
that
the
d
&
r.g.had
a
6.06
rate
of
return,
whose
operations
are
50%
within
the
state
of
utah.
the
bamberger
railroad
which
is
all
commodity
railroad
operating
with
its
line
solely
within
the
state
of
utah
has
a
very
high
rate
of
return
15.98%.
it
has
never
been
adequately
explained
by
the
railroads
nor
the
interstate
commerce
commission
why
that
high
rate
of
return
exists
within
the
state
of
utah
on
an
all
commodity
road.
mr.
keith
sohm
it
--
its
rate
would
be
raised
15%
along
with
the
others.
that
is
the
reason
that
we
feel
that
they
can't
have
a
flat
overall
uniform
rate
increase
without
showing
something
distinguishing
about
the
state
of
utah
from
the
other
conditions
in
the
interstate
commerce.
the
--
mr.
keith
sohm
no,
the
bamberger
road
is
an
individual
railroad
which
operates
over
a
distance
of
about
35
miles.
mr.
keith
sohm
within
utah
entirely.
mr.
keith
sohm
now
it
does
carry
and
we
will
admit
that
it
does
carry
interstate
commerce
traffic
as
well
as
intrastate
commerce
traffic.
mr.
keith
sohm
it
connects,
i
think
all
of
the
principal
railroads,
both
the
southern
pacific,
the
western
pacific
and
the
union
pacific
and
i
believe
the
d
&
r.g.also.
but
that
its
--
its
level
of
rates
on
interstate
commerce
is
held
down
to
its
intrastate
level
of
rates
which
still
holds
it
at
the
intrastate
level
on
its
--
on
its
return.
mr.
keith
sohm
well,
we
--
we
have
--
mr.
keith
sohm
now
--
mr.
keith
sohm
no.
we
--
we
feel
that
--
that
it
is
just
an
exemplary
railroad
of
the
--
of
the
railroads
that's
operating
within
the
state
of
utah
and
that
be
in
a
representative
railroad
all
in
all
commodities
as
much
as
the
denver
and
rio
grande
and
the
western
pacific
and
the
southern
pacific
and
union
pacific
that
it
is
represented
with
the
type
of
returns
that
are
being
gained
from
those
railroads
in
the
state
of
utah.
and
that
the
railroads
have
not
carried
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that's
not
true.
mr.
keith
sohm
i
have
--
i
don't
know
of
the
--
mr.
keith
sohm
i
don't
know
--
mr.
keith
sohm
--
if
they
usually
do
it
or
not
but
we
--
we
surprise
them
--
mr.
keith
sohm
they
did
here.
mr.
keith
sohm
we
surprise
them
--
mr.
keith
sohm
yes,
maybe
so.
i
know
that
the
pattern
they
used
in
lighting
up
the
order
imposing
the
increase
is
up
on
the
state
of
utah
is
almost
identical
than
you
can
put
it
page
for
page
--
mr.
keith
sohm
--
on
the
patterns
used
by
the
other
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
against
to
other
states.
mr.
keith
sohm
no.
[laughs]
to
that
degree,
they
did
not.
so
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
railroads
have
argued
that
all
conditions
are
the
same
in
utah
as
in
interstate
commission
as
stated
by
counsel
is
--
is
not
the
same,
not
only
because
the
density
figures
we
introduced
to
show
were
not
the
same
whether
they're
or
for
against
us,
they
show
that
they're
not
the
same
but
because
the
railroads
in
their
own
exhibit
stated
that
the
revenue
needs
of
the
railroads
were
for
$1,860,000
as
$60,000
and
that
most
of
that
is
actually
products
of
mines
$1,500,000
so
that
that
alone
shows
that
the
movements
are
considerably
different.
thank
you,
your
honors.
