mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
if
the
court
please.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
utah.
the
action
was
brought
by
the
appellants
here,
the
plaintiff
below,
for
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
taking
jurisdiction
of
and
raising
utah
intrastate
railroad
freight
rates
under
the
provisions
of
section
13
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
decision
below
was
a
2-to-1
decision.
the
majority
report
was
concurred
in
by
circuit
judge
pickett
and
judge
ritter
and
a
minority
opinion
written
by
judge
christensen.
the
opinions
are
--
appear
in
the
record.
the
manner
in
which
this
case
arose
is
as
follows.
in
1951
or
shortly
before
that
date,
the
railroads,
class
one
railroads
of
the
united
states
made
application
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
an
increase
in
substantially
all
interstate
rail
freight
rates.
the
first
hearing
on
this
application
which
was
given
the
number
ex
parte
175,
and
by
which
i
will
refer
to
the
proceedings
hereafter,
all
railroads
in
the
united
states
were
granted
permission
to
increase
their
freight
rates
by
2%
with
certain
hold-down
which
are
not
material
here.
at
a
subsequent
hearing,
the
eastern
roads
were
permitted
to
take
an
additional
7%
and
the
western
and
southern
roads
an
additional
4%.
and
there's
still
a
third
here
on
hearing
under
ex
parte
175.
the
eastern
roads
were
permitted
to
take
an
additional
6%
and
the
western
and
southern
roads
an
additional
9%
so
that
all
told
under
ex
parte
175,
the
interstate
rate
--
freight
rates
of
all
the
railroads
with,
as
i
said,
certain
hold-downs
which
are
not
material
here
were
increased
by
15%.
shortly
after
the
original
application
was
made
with
the
public
or
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
class
one
railways
which
operated
within
and
through
the
state
of
utah,
made
application
to
the
public
service
commission
of
utah
for
authority
to
increase
their
intrastate
rates
by
the
same
percentages
being
sought
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
interstate
rates.
the
time
of
the
first
increase
before
the
i.c.c.,
a
hearing
was
held
for
the
utah
commission.
the
conclusion
of
this
hearing,
the
utah
commission
ruled,
the
railroads
have
not
introduced
evidence
sufficient
to
authorize
the
increase
of
the
intrastate
rates.
the
time
of
the
second
order
in
the
ex
parte
175,
a
further
petition
was
filed
with
the
utah
commission
but
no
hearing
was
ever
had
on
that.
and
then
at
the
time
of
the
final
order,
in
ex
parte
175
on
the
--
that
had
build
up
to
15%,
a
third
petition
was
filed
by
the
utah
commission
with
this
class
one
railways
and
a
full
hearing
was
held
thereon
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
utah
commission
ruled
that
the
petitioning
railroads
have
not
introduced
evidence
sufficient
to
authorize
the
increase
of
the
utah
intrastate
rates
and
held
that
the
application
was
denied
subject
to
the
right
of
the
railroad
to
make
a
petition
to
reopen
to
introduce
the
additional
evidence
if
they
could
do
it.
the
railroads
did
not
make
further
application
to
the
utah
commission
nor
did
they
take
any
appeal
in
the
utah
courts,
rather
they
made
application
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
the
provisions
of
section
13
to
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission
take
jurisdiction
of
this
utah
rates
and
raise
them.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
proceeded
with
a
hearing
of
the
utah
intrastate
rates.
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
hearing,
issued
the
report
and
order
which
appears
evidence
in
the
court
below
in
which
they
held
that
the
requisite
jurisdictional
facts
had
been
established
to
authorize
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
utah
rates.
they
did
take
jurisdiction
of
the
utah
intrastate
rail
rates
and
ordered
them
increased
by
15%
with
certain
restricted
hold-down
which
again
are
not
material
here.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
the
case
was
heard
by
an
examiner
and
tried
to
visualize
the
--
i
argued
the
case
but
i
can't
recall
whether
one
of
our
commissioners
sat
at
the
time
the
section
13
case
was
held.
on
the
opinion,
he
did
not.
an
action
was
brought
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
they
appeared
as
a
party.
the
commission
appeared
as
a
party
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes,
but
not
--
it
wasn't
in
a
joint
board
hearing
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
--
if
that's
what
your
honor
want
to
know.
no,
it
was
not.
this
action
as
i've
stated
then
--
was
then
brought
in
the
three-judge
court
to
set
aside
this
order.
a
preliminary
injunction
was
entered
holding
the
rates
out
of
effect
while
the
matter
was
considered
and
this
stayed
in
effect
until
a
matter
was
decided
on
its
merits
and
as
i've
stated
by
two
to
one
decision,
the
action
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
upheld
by
the
utah
three-judge
court.
now,
we
are
not
here
of
course
protesting
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
take
jurisdiction
of
intrastate
rates
in
a
proper
case.
we
recognized
the
necessity
where
interstate
and
intrastate
service
is
rendered
by
a
common
economic
unit
that
somebody
must
have
overall
control
to
determine
that
too
much
of
the
burden
is
not
shifted
one
way
or
the
other
and
even
before
the
section
13
was
adopted,
this
court
have
already
decided
that
that
power
existed
inherently
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that
was
in
the
houston
case.
the
interstate
--
the
section
13
was
merely
a
codification
of
the
houston
case
and
it
decided
or
it
establishes
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
take
jurisdiction
of
purely
intrastate
rates
only
if
one
of
two
conditions
exists.
the
first
condition
is,
if
the
intrastate
rates
are
so
low
that
they
make
a
discrimination
between
persons
shipping
on
--
in
interstate
commerce
on
the
one
hand
and
intrastate
commerce
on
the
other.
now,
with
regard
to
that
first
ground
of
jurisdiction,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decided
that
the
railroads
did
not
establish
that
ground
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
and
so
we
need
to
concern
ourselves
no
further
here
with
the
first
ground
of
jurisdiction
under
the
13th
section.
the
second
ground
of
jurisdiction
under
which
the
railroad
or
the
i.c.c.may
take
jurisdiction
of
intrastate
rates
is
this,
if
the
rates
are
so
low
that
they
cast
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
in
other
words,
if
the
intrastate
revenue
--
net
revenue
that
is
the
amount
of
railroads
can
keep
after
paying
the
expenses
is
so
low
that
it
does
not
pay
the
railroads
return
on
that
portion
of
the
capital,
devolves
the
intrastate
commerce
and
therefore
that
an
extra
financial
burden
must
be
placed
on
interstate
commerce
then
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
that
situation
may
take
jurisdiction
of
intrastate
rates
and
raise
them.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that
may
well
be,
your
honor.
at
the
present
time
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
--
because
that
is
under
the
section
13.
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
i.c.c.took
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
they
held
that
the
evidence
did
establish
that
the
utah
intrastate
rates
were
so
low
that
they
did
cast
a
burden
upon
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that
is
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
we're
concerned
here
with
the
overall
earnings
and
not
with
any
specific
rate
that
is
being
considered.
now,
furthermore,
we're
not
here
attacking
the
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case.
we'll
agree
that
the
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case
meet
the
requirements
that
this
court
laid
down
in
the
recent
king
case.
in
fact,
they
were
copied
verbatim
from
the
king
case
as
merely
as
i
can
determine
with
merely
a
change
in
the
word
here
and
i
make
the
florida
case
fit
the
utah
situation.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
what's
that?
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
ultimate
findings.
yes,
your
honor.
the
ultimate
findings
i
should
say
subsidiary
findings
we
do
quarrel
with,
but
the
ultimate
findings,
we
do
not.
they
meet
--
they
meet
the
demand
of
the
king
case.but
we
do
say
that
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
under
the
king
case,
even
under
the
king
case
to
find
in
this
situation
that
the
utah
intrastate
rates
are
as
low
as
to
cast
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
obviously,
the
most
practical
and
direct
way
if
you
could
do
it,
i
think
they
can
but
the
railroad
said
they
can't.
in
the
king's
case
said
they
don't
have
to,
to
show
what
your
intrastate
rates
were
returning,
whether
it
would
be
breakdown
revenues,
cost,
and
make
an
allocation
of
your
equipment
and
work
up
an
intrastate
rate
of
return.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes.
we
challenge
the
findings
--
i'll
try
to
give
it
verbatim.
i
may
not
be
able
to.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
findings
that
conditions
affecting
the
transportation
of
utah
freight
intrastate
are
not
more
favorable
than
those
affecting
interstate
traffic.
with
--
from
the
points
in
utah
to
points
beyond
utah,
that
is
the
specific
finding
that
we
attack
and
we
say
that
is
the
thing
which
they
didn't
prove
even
under
the
formula
which
is
laid
down
in
the
king
case.
now
under
the
king
case
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes,
under
the
doctrine
in
the
king
case.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that
is
right.
that's
--
that's
the
whole
--
that's
the
whole
case
we
have,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well,
all
of
them
would
be
involved
in
directly
but
the
one
that
is
involved
directly
at
the
moment
would
be
number
one.
the
one
we
attack
directly,
we
say
their
balance
of
them
falls
along
one
if
one
falls,
that's
at
the
top
of
page
118.
and
that
finding
of
course,
number
one
finding
on
page
118,
that's
--
that's
something
you
got
to
have
under
the
king
case
and
you've
got
to
have
it
supported
under
the
king
case
because
the
king
case
rest
upon
just
exactly
that
finding
there.
the
king
case,
as
i
read
it,
and
also
the
illinois
commerce
case
which
it
quotes,
is
merely
a
syllogistic
reasoning,
it
says
this
in
effect,
“you're
relieved
to
breaking
down
your
revenues,
your
expenses
and
your
investment
between
intrastate
and
interstate,
if
you
can
meet
this
test.
and
it's
a
test
--
it
is
a
syllogism
in
fact”.
the
king
case
based
upon
a
syllogism
is
this.
your
major
premise
is
the
railroads
are
in
need
of
a
general
overall
increase
in
their
railroad
rates.
your
minor
premise
is
this,
“all
factors
which
affect
the
reasonableness
of
rates
are
identical
or
reasonably
similar
as
to
both
intrastate
and
interstate
commerce.
therefore,
you
should
have
an
increase
in
intrastate
rates”.
now,
if
either
your
major
or
minor
premise
breaks
down
of
course
your
conclusion
doesnt
follow.
and
we
say
that
in
this
case,
the
finding
number
one
being
the
minor
premise
in
that
syllogism
has
broken
down
and
so
that
the
conclusion,
that
utah
intrastate
rate
is
abnormally
low
doesn't
follow.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
all
--
all
major
--
all
material
factors.
we
don't
say
that
you
must
get
laid
down
to
the
most
minute
factor.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
oh
i
--
i
assume
so.
but
all
material
factors
affecting
the
thing
we
think
must
be
shown
--
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
king
case,
must
be
shown
to
be
not
more
favorable
in
favor
of
intrastate
commerce
and
they
aren't.
they
have
interstate
commerce.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
the
key
to
the
thing
in
my
opinion.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
believe
the
king
case
is
an
exercise
in
formal
logic,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
you
--
you
are
--
all
you've
got
in
regard
to
the
--
to
the
earnings
of
the
railroad
or
your
overall
earnings,
they
say
they
can't
break
them
down.
they
say
they
can't
break
their
earnings
out
or
maybe
they
could
break
their
earnings
out
but
they
couldn't
break
their
cost
and
their
investments
on
intrastate.
and
so,
we're
dealing
with
overall
figures
of
the
railroad
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
--
with
both
intrastate
and
interstate
lumped
in
there.
all
right
now,
i
will
agree
and
i'm
not
calling
with
the
fact
that
they
did
a
good
job
in
this
case
of
establishing
a
need
for
overall
revenue
about
80%
of
their
evidence
goes
to
that
point
and
they've
established
that
they
need
some
additional
money.
all
right,
now
the
question
is,
where
does
it
got
--
come
from
it?
it
doesn't
prove
a
thing
merely
to
prove
you
need
additional
money.
that
doesn't
prove
that
the
intrastate
rates
aren't
contributing
their
share,
if
we
just
go
that
far.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
all
right,
now
we
come
to
the
second
step
which
i
say
is
the
minor
premise
in
syllogism
which
is
this.
they
must
show
that
all
of
material
factors
affecting
the
two
classes
of
traffic
are
the
same
and
if
they
can
establish
that,
then
under
the
king
case
it
follows
that
both
intrastate
and
interstate
rates
should
move
out.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
if
that
breaks
down,
then
the
--
then
it
doesn't
follow
at
all.
it
may
be
that
one
or
the
other
should
go
up
and
should
take
that
one
or
the
other
should
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well
i
--
i
quite
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
but,
i
feel
that
--
and
i
might
say
that
i
had
one
for
the
judge's
below
that
felt
along
with
me
that
this
matter
of
density
of
traffic
was
a
major
factor
that
not
all
--
now,
we
felt
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
belong
to
them.
we
should
felt
that
they
should
show
that
all
major
factors
are
the
same.
they
didn't
put
a
word
in
on
density
of
traffic
then
we
picked
up
the
ball
when
we
don't
think
we
have
to
carry
it
and
we
showed
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
density
of
traffic
only
to
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rather
dismiss
our
figures.
now,
i'll
come
to
that
a
little
more
fully
in
just
a
moment
if
i
may.
on
the
question
of
the
level
of
the
rates
themselves
and
of
course
that's
the
first
thing
you've
got
to
consider
is
which
now
is
higher
for
a
comparable
service,
the
intrastate
or
interstate
rates.
there
was
a
--
there
was
evidence
on
both
sides
there
and
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
weigh
that
evidence
at
this
time.
we
feel
that
the
evidence
heavenly
preponderates
in
favor
of
the
--
of
our
position
that
the
intrastate
rates
from
utah
were
already
considerably
higher
for
a
comparable
service
without
the
15%
increase
in
the
interstate
rates
or
before
they
got.
but
once
again
i
say
there
was
evidence
on
both
sides
of
that
and
we're
not
here
asking
the
supreme
court
to
weigh
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
the
court
below.
but
now,
going
to
the
other
side
of
the
picture,
and
you've
got
to
go
to
both
sides
of
the
picture
in
determining
the
thing.
that
is
the
question
of
cost
in
rendering
the
service
because
we're
not
worried
of
gross
revenues
here
as
mr.
collins
so
well
points
out
in
his
brief.
what
we're
worrying
about
is
how
much
the
railroads
have
left
over
to
spend.
so
you've
got
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
thing
and
look
at
the
cost
factor.
what
do
we
have
in
the
way
of
identity
of
factors
that
affect
the
cost
of
rendering
railroad
service
intrastate
and
interstate?
now,
the
railroads
introduced
one
bit
of
evidence
on
that
point,
a
one
bit
of
evidence
only
and
if
that
evidence
is
sufficient,
i
suppose,
i
have
no
standing
before
this
court.
if
it's
not,
i
should
prevail.
the
evidence
that
they
introduced
and
they
didn't
have
to
introduce
it
at
all
because
this
court
has
taken
the
judicial
notice
of
it
several
times
and
so
as
the
commission.
the
evidence
they
introduced
is
the
identity
of
cost
factors
was
the
fact
that
intrastate
and
interstate
shipments
are
commonly
mingled
on
the
same
cars,
handled
over
the
same
rails
to
the
same
station
to
the
same
billing
crews
and
so
forth.
now,
i
--
it's
our
position
that
while
that
does
establish
that
many
of
these
factors
are
similar,
it
does
ignore
entirely
the
question
of
density
of
traffic
which
we
feel
that
one
of
the
major
items
which
go
to
make
up
the
revenue
cost
of
rendering
the
service
of
the
railroad.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
the
density
of
traffic
is
a
major
factor
affecting
cost
is
quite
obvious.
you
can
break
railroad
cost
or
any
transportation
cost
or
i
suppose
the
cost
of
doing
business
in
any
business
down
roughly
into
two
categories.
that
is
your
fixed
cost
and
your
variable
cost.
your
fixed
cost
stays
just
about
the
same
regardless
of
how
much
you
produce.
your
variable
cost
tends
to
vary
almost
exactly
with
your
output.
and
generally,
your
output
on
the
railroad
is
raised
in
terms
of
ton
miles.
so
your
fix
cost
saying
the
same
regardless
of
your
output
of
ton
miles
will
bear
heavier
on
each
ton
mile
as
your
density
decreases.
and
as
your
density
goes
up,
your
fixed
cost
staying
the
same
will
be
scattered
out
and
spread
over
a
greater
number
of
ton
miles
and
so
the
greater
the
density,
the
lower
the
cost
of
producing
each
ton
mile.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes,
as
your
density
increases
you
--
your
proportion
of
the
fixed
cost
becomes
lower
proportionately
on
each
unit
of
transportation
produce.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
we
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes,
it's
in
the
record.
i
might
say
this,
your
honor.
the
railroads,
although
we
feel
that
they
have
the
burden,
showed
nothing
on
that.
they
said
we
ship
--
we
ship
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
on
the
same
cargo
with
the
same
rails
period.
that's
it.
that's
all
we're
going
to
put
in.
that's
all
we
have
put
in
on
identity.
we
then
went
on
and
showed
by
a
study
which
we
have
and
which
appears
in
the
record
exhibits
and
--
exhibit
65
i
believe
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
it's
in
the
second
volume.
i
will
attempt
to
find
it
here.
it
shows
that
in
regard
to
the
four
major
railroads
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
exhibit
64
it's
referred
to
in
my
brief
if
i
remember
your
honor
but
i
can't
seem
to
locate
it
very
quickly.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
548,
let
me
see,
your
honor.
it's
exhibit
64
i
believe.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
it's
exhibit
64
on
page
548
which
shows
the
density
of
traffic
intrastate
or
system-wide
on
the
various
railroads
concerned
for
the
years
1950
to
1953
and
the
density
of
traffic
intrastate
within
the
state
of
utah.
and
if
you
will
examine
that,
you
will
see
that
in
every
year
for
each
of
the
four
railroads
and
these
railroads
makeup
all
95%
to
98%
of
the
traffic
that
we're
concerned
with
here.
in
each
of
those
years,
on
each
of
those
four
railroads,
the
density
was
materially
higher
within
the
state
of
utah
than
it
was
system-wide.
now,
this
is
true.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court
on
that.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
this
is
main-line.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no.
that's
the
ground
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
attack
it
on.
there's
another
ground
that
the
counsel
for
the
government
is
attacked
on
in
his
brief.
and
i'd
like
to
mention
both
of
those,
the
counsel
for
the
government
attacks
on
the
ground
that
what
we
call
intrastate
statistics
are
not
purely
intrastate.
they
do
include
bridge
traffic
but
of
course
the
bridge
traffic
goes
clear
across.
we
have
no
way
of
breaking
it
out.
but
the
fact
that
--
but
bridge
traffic
would
be
constant
system-wide
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
difference
within
the
state
of
utah,
the
density
much
higher
there
than
system-wide
with
the
bridge
traffic
remaining
constant
could
be
a
tribute
and
only
to
the
fact
that
utah
intrastate
traffic
was
considerably
higher
than
the
intrastate
traffic
in
the
other
states.
do
i
make
myself
clear?
now,
the
problem
that
the
i.c.c.raises
to
this
study
is
this.
they
say,
“well
the
problem
of
that
study
is
they
practically
pushed
it
out
of
consideration
was
that
its
density
of
traffic
for
main-line
rack
only
and
not
for
main-line
plus
branch.”
well
that's
true
but
for
the
life
of
me,
i
can't
see
what
difference
it
makes,
if
we
use
branch
--
included
branch
on
one
side
and
only
main-line
on
the
other,
obviously,
it
would
be
a
false
comparison.
but
if
we
have
main
and
branch
system-wide
as
well
as
intrastate
while
it
would
change
the
density
figures,
it
wouldn't
change
their
relative
position.
in
other
words,
both
of
them
would
move
up
or
move
down.
and
i
believe
that
the
main-line
study
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no,
they
do
not.
neither
of
them
included
branch
figures,
your
honor.
they're
both.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
they
may
have
that
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
oh
no,
density
doesn't
take
everything
into
account
sir.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
it
does
not.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
quite
agree
with
that,
your
honor
but
i
believe
that
the
identity
--
that's
one
place
i
believe
the
railroad
has
born
their
burden
of
proof.
i
think
their
testimony
or
if
you
want
to
put
at
the
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
your
intra
--
or
that
you
handle
intrastate
and
interstate
shipments
on
the
same
train,
their
both
going
to
go
over
the
same
track,
over
the
same
rates
and
so
forth
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that
is
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well
that
may
well
be.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no,
they
are
not
and
we
don't
think
that
we
bear
the
burden
of
proving
or
disapproving.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
think
perhaps
that
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no,
i
think
they
are
--
i
think
they
maybe
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
if
there
is
a
difference
then
i
think
they
are
relevant.
but
i
think
if
they
are
relevant
then
it's
the
railroads
burden
and
not
ours
to
produce
them.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well,
it
is.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes,
sir.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well,
the
details
are
complicated,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
but
i
think
the
railroads
are
attempting
to
unduly
simplify
them.
i
believe
what
the
railroads
are
doing
in
this
case,
not
only
in
the
state
of
utah,
but
throughout
the
nation
in
175
--
it
is
175,
they're
attempting
to
push
the
king
case
to
a
length
that
this
commission
never
intended
it
to
go.
i
might
say
that
i
don't
agree
with
the
king
case
but
there
is
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
we'll
start
from
the
king
case
and
what
it
is
and
they're
attempting
to
prove
--
to
push
it
to
lengths
that
this
commission
never
intended
it
to
go
so
that
it
forces
absolute,
automatic
uniformity
in
a
rate,
every
time
you
get
a
rate
increase.
and
if
what
--
if
they
can
prove
the
case
before
the
i.c.c.by
the
evidence
they've
got
in
here
then
there's
no
need
for
a
section
13
hearing.
there's
no
need
for
a
public
service
commission
hearing
because
every
time
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
says,
“the
railroads
are
entitled
to
additional
revenues
overall
then
by
the
mere
application
that
this
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
you
intermingle
your
freight,
then
automatically
that
increase
should
go
on
to
intrastate
freight
as
well
as
interstate.
and
so,
all
of
your
--
all
of
your
problem
before
your
state
commission
and
your
section
13
case
is
a
mere
surplus
because
they
can
only
come
out
one
way
in
the
end
anyway.
now,
that's
--
that
appears
to
be
mr.
collins'
position.
now,
the
government
doesn't
go
quite
far
in
their
brief.
they
don't
say
that
the
king
case
forces
you
definitely
to
that
position
but
they
say
the
fact
that
you
intermingle
your
freight,
raises
a
strong
presumption
that
all
factors
are
the
same
and
to
quote
the
government's
brief,
they
say
it
is
possible
although
not
probable
that
notwithstanding
identity
in
the
character
of
interstate
in
interstate
operations
therein
may
exist
certain
circumstances.
in
other
words,
they
say
once
we
have
proved
this
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
to
intermingle
them,
then
the
burden
of
proof
approve
is
on
the
--
the
opponents
of
an
increase
and
to
show
that
the
factors
are
different.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that
is
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
exactly,
your
honor.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
my
burden.
i
just
--
we
introduced
it
for
exactly
the
purpose,
your
honor
set
forth.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
answer
is
yes
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
this
would
have
been
a
more
valuable
study,
had
you
related
your
traffic
in
arriving
at
a
density
figure,
had
you
related
your
traffic
move
to
total
mileage
of
main-line
and
branch
rather
than
merely
main-line
as
you
did?
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
now,
we
--
we
used
our
density
figure
here
is
total
--
total
tons
moved
or
total
ton
miles
moved
divided
by
main-line
track.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
what
we've
done
both
system-wide
and
what
we
have
designated
interstate.
now,
we
could
have
done
it
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said,
we
could
have
taken
your
total
ton
miles
and
divided
it
by
your
branch
line
plus
your
main-line.
if
you
did,
it
would
have
given
a
somewhat
lower
density
figure
because
you'd
be
taking
the
same
ton
miles
in
using
more
miles
of
track
to
divide
it
by.
but
it
would
--
we
say
it
wouldn't
have
changed
the
relative
position
between
your
intrastate
statistics
and
your
system
statistics
because
lower
them
both
and
substantially
the
same
proportion.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
exactly
right,
we
put
this
in
here
merely
for
the
purpose
that
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
--
to
point
out
the
fact
that
here
is
a
--
not
only
a
factor
but
a
most
material
factor
that
they've
missed
on
which
they
bare
--
bore
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
you
mean
for
practical
standpoint?
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
for
the
practical
standpoint,
it
happens
this
way.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
it
is
not
in
the
evidence.
i'm
telling
you
something
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
it
does.
southern
pacific
comes
in
to
utah
and
california.
it
extends
in
the
utah
from
the
western
border
to
salt
lake
city.
it
extends
through
a
heavy
livestock
company
as
--
area
and
there
are
some
salt
mines
and
such
things
as
that
on
the
train
so
--
on
the
track
between
utah
and
the
border.
and
so
between
salt
lake
and
the
border
of
utah
there
is
heavy
traffic
and
heavy
commodity
whereas
you
get
beyond
the
border
into
nevada
and
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
don't
recall
an
intrastate
case
that
has
considered
that
but
many
cases
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
study
density
of
traffic
for
the
purpose
of
determining
comparative
rates
of
interstate.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
other
in
this
one,
i
do
not.
we
introduced
some
other
evidence
which
i
just
--
my
time
is
almost
up.
i
want
to
leave
some
for
--
for
rebuttal.
there
was
other
evidence
which
we
introduced
that
we
didn't
think
we
had
to
which
tends
to
show
that
the
railroads
are
a
lot
better-off
under
utah
intrastate
traffic
than
they
are
elsewhere.
for
instance,
bamberger
railroad
company,
the
only
one
--
the
only
general
commodity
carrier
that
was
making
application
that
operates
entirely
within
the
state
of
utah
in
the
year
preceding
this
hearing,
showed
a
rate
of
return
of
some
15.93%.
in
addition
to
that
from
the
railroad's
own
figures,
you
can
glean
these
facts
that
bamberger,
as
i
say,
solely
within
the
state,
showed
a
rate
of
return
of
15.3%.
denver
and
rio
grande
which
is
about
half
in
the
state
of
utah
and
half
in
the
state
of
colorado
showed
a
6.06%
rate
of
return.
the
union
pacific
which
has
some
in
utah
although
a
much
smaller
percentage
showed
3.56%
returns
while
the
denver
or
the
southern
pacific
that
pass
just
a
minute
fraction
of
its
business
in
the
state
of
utah
showed
only
a
3.48%
rate
of
return.
in
other
words,
on
these
roads,
that
--
from
their
own
evidence
as
the
percentage
of
the
railroad
business
in
utah
intrastate
traffic
tends
to
increase
the
rate
of
return
of
those
roads
tends
to
increase
right
along
with.
now,
we
say
there
--
ones
again
you
can
determine
the
reason
for
that
from
the
economic
studies
that
have
been
put
in
here.
now,
they
put
in
economic
studies
in
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
showing,
i
think,
that
utah
could
stand
the
increase.
we
say
it
doesn't
mean
anything
from
there
because
that
isn't
a
basis
for
a
jurisdiction
under
the
13th
section.
in
other
words,
if
the
i.c.c.have
general
jurisdiction,
they
may
say,
“we'll
put
the
burden
on
the
high
moving
traffic”
but
they
can't
say
to
utah
shippers,
we
know
you're
paying
your
share
now
but
can
afford
to
pay
more
so
we'll
take
jurisdiction
under
the
13th
section.
we
think
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
--
presupposes
that
the
investors
wouldn't
get
a
fair
return,
i
think
that's
what
it
presupposes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
right.
i
agree.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes,
sir.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
answer
to
that
is,
i
think,
you
can't
do
it,
your
honor.
under
the
constitution,
under
the
13
section
because
the
i.c.c.doesn't
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
all
right.
let's
--
unless
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
let's
stay
with
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
all
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
but
under
the
13th
section,
the
i.c.c.doesn't
have
primary
jurisdiction
in
the
utah
rates,
it's
gets
only
under
extraordinary
condition.
and
the
extraordinary
condition
set
forth
there
isn't
that
the
railroads
needs
some
fact
here,
some
we
can
go
get
the
condition
of
them
taking
us
is
the
railroads
leave
some
fact,
they're
getting
all
they
can
get
here.
here's
a
place
up
here
that
isn't
giving
its
share.
therefore
we're
going
to
dig
in
to
that.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
because
of
(voice
overlap)
competitive
situations.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
because
of
competitive
situations.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
all
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
all
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes.
i
would
say
definitely
that
under
the
13th
section,
you
may
not
impose
an
extra
burden
on
intrastate
traffic
to
compensate
for
the
fact
that
interstate
traffic
can't
bear
its
full
share.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
the
thing
works
in
the
reverse.
you
could
--
you
may
--
they
may
take
jurisdiction
of
intrastate
traffic
only
when
the
evidence
shows
that
the
intrastate
is
not
bearing
its
share.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
well
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no.
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
your
honor.
if
they
--
if
--
if
they
want
to
--
if
the
railroads
want
to
address
that
kind
of
logic,
the
place
they've
got
to
go
is
to
the
commission
that
holds
primary
jurisdiction
of
intrastate
rates.
that
is
to
the
various
state
commissions.
if
they
could
go
to
various
state
commissions
and
say,
the
intrastate
--
the
interstate
rates
can't
bear
their
full
burden,
therefore,
unless
your
men
take
up
to
some
of
the
burden
they
can't
bear,
you're
going
to
lose
your
rail
service.
that's
the
place
to
go
with
that
but
the
i.c.c.--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i've
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
no.
i
think
they
cannot,
your
honor.
i
think,
under
the
section
13,
the
i.c.c.may
take
jurisdiction
only
when
the
interstate
rates
are
contributing
their
fair
share
on
the
intrastate
rates
that
they're
going
after
are
not
contributing
their
fair
share.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
anything
else
into
section
13
or
into
the
decisions
of
this
court,
interpreting
section
13
other
than
that.
i
know
that
you
have
held
and
i
think
quite
properly,
that
15
(a)
should
be
read
in
connection
with
13
(4).
but
i
don't
think
it
expands
the
power
of
the
commission
under
13
(4),
when
you
got
a
jurisdictional
question
involved.
once
you
get
over
the
jurisdictional
question,
i
think,
then
perhaps
15
(a)
does
come
in
to
operation,
but
until
you
get
to
jurisdictional
requirements,
i
think
you've
got
to
look
at
13
(4)
further.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
--
for
rebuttal.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
yes.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
--
for
affirmative
action
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
we
agree
to
that
is
so.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
--
i
so
stated
in
my
argument
mr.--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
sohm
is
going
to
handle
our
rebuttal
but
i
would
like
the
permission
of
the
court
to
break
our
argument
once
more
to
take
just
a
moment
to
try
and
get
myself
out
of
trouble,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
i
think
i'll
try
to
explain
that
exhibit.
mr.
calvin
l.
rampton
and
it's
--
it's
in
my
brief
how
it
was
figured
so
--
