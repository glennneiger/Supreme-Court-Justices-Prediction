what
i
consider
the
material
factor
that
they
did
not
prove
and
that
we
think
we'd
prove
--
we
think
we
picked
up
a
burden
of
proof
that
we
didn't
have

bear
and
show
that
there
was
a
difference.

that
is
the
question
of
density
of
traffic.
that's
the

of
traffic,
your
honor.

order
to
prove
that
all
facts
which

calvi
