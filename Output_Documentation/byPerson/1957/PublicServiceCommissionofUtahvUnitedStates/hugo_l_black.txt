could
you
state
in
a
sentence
that
it
might
not
be
possible
what
has
to
be
shown
in
addition
to
the
showing
that
raised
--
raised
interstate
rates
15%
(inaudible).
what
has
to
be
shown?
what
is
the
standard
on
which
you
would
determine
whether
the
commission
was
acting
properly
in
raising
the
state
--
intrastate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
that
concededly
true
here,
your
second
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
left
me
a
little
in
doubt
yet
in
your
criteria.
maybe
--
maybe
it's
suggested
that
you
could
get
it.
your
first
one
seems
to
be
the
only
one
that
have
any
--
cover
any
crucial
significance
here,
namely,
the
operating
conditions
are
different.
you
mean
the
operating
conditions
in
the
state
are
different
in
the
operated
conditions
outside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
favorable?
it
cost
more
or
less
or
what?
what
--
what
is
a
--
i
don't
quite
yet
get
to
understand
what
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
by
reason
of
mass
transportation.
i'm
speaking
in
terms
(inaudible)
prefer
to
transportation
to
something
like
a
mass
production.
suppose
it
by
reason
of
mass
transportation
inside
the
state.
the
railroad
can
really
make
more
money
on
the
traffic
that
it
can
on
interstate
commerce.
is
that
--
would
that
come
within
your
criteria?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
total
quantity
of
transportation
inside
the
state,
to
a
such
nature
that
so
many
(inaudible)
the
result
that
the
intrastate
in
utah
actually
cost
less
than
the
others.
could
you
raised
up
utah
rates
for
those
in
the
interstate
commerce
under
your
criteria?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
weston,
your
argument
leaves
me
a
little
doubt.
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
all
cases,
you
have
that
special
identity
of
operation.
suppose
they
operate
the
same
kind
of
car,
place
the
same
kind
of
wage
in
it,
and
therefore
since
there
is
an
identity
of
operation
is
automatically
followed
that
the
commission
had
a
right
to
equalize
the
rate.
now,
if
that's
the
case,
why
isn't
that
true
all
over
the
country
with
reference
to
every
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
didn't
--
why
isn't
that
urging
if
that
that
they
have
the
power
to
say
that
despite
congress'
definition
there
that
they
can
show
identity
of
operation
by
showing
what
everybody
knows
the
average
kind
of
train
with
the
same
kind
of
employees
is
entitled
to
equalized
rate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
right.
but
i'm
--
i'm
just
wondering
how
you
--
well
the
way
you
define
identity
of
rates,
it
sound
--
operation,
it
sounds
that's
what
you
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
should
the
commission
show
that
is
the
burden
on
them
or
is
the
burden
on
the
other
end
to
show
that
there
are
special
lines
of
that
kind
in
such
a
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
that
just
the
same
fact
by
saying
that
what
we
are
faced
with
here
is
there
are
two
sections.
one
of
them
says
you've
got
to
consider
all
national
railroads.
there's
not
any
doubt
about
that.
this
court
recognizes
time
and
time
again
that
another
one
gives
power
to
change
the
intrastate
rates
if
they're
unjust
and
discriminatory.
but
if
--
if
all
you
have
to
show
there
is
that
operations
are
alike
because
they're
always
are,
except
maybe
in
special
isolated
instances
(inaudible).
now,
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
your
argument
leave
to
the
conclusion
that
the
commission
has
a
right
to
do
this
automatically
because
the
train
is
over
a
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
guess
that
would
be
a
little
difficult
to
show
when
you
get
a
15%
raise
of
freight.
people
got
to
carry
it.
of
course
it's
conceivable
that
it
might
go
up
so
high
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
is
general
--
general
increases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
specialize
and
pick
up
certain
things
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
the
premise
from
which
i
understood
mr.
rampton
argued
is
correct.
let's
suppose
it's
correct.
i
understood
him
and
maybe
i
understood
him
--
i
understood
him
to
take
the
position
of
utah
or
somewhat
like
texas
and
other
institute.
utah
is
big
of
a
state
that
by
reason
of
vast
business
enterprises
moving
backwards
and
forward,
here
and
there
just
different.
a
lot
of
business.
it's
taking
all
that
business
together.
he
says,
they
carry
this
stuff
cheaper.
i
understood
there
to
be
the
line
of
his
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he's
right
in
that,
where
they
right
in
--
was
the
commission
right
in
giving
his
raise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
ask
you
to
see
before
you
did
it,
whether
where
would
come
out
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
crucial
or
is
it
not.
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now
how
is
that
possible?
the
same
railroad
tracks
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
the
operating
conditions
of
tracks
and
rails
that
the
people
is
doing,
how
is
it
possible
for
you
that
that
not
to
be
the
same
with
reference
to
both
interstate
and
intrastate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
have
to
prove?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
why
is
that
necessary
to
prove?
maybe
they
are
but
i
would
suppose
as
all
railroad
where
they're
operate
in
interstate
and
intrastate.
can
interstate
or
intrastate
have
right
on
the
same
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
at
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
have
no
doubt
about
that
but
when
it
gives
rates
that
are
going
to
interstate
--
things
that
are
going
interstate
is
carried
on
the
same
rate,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
same
track.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
done
in
birmingham,
alabama
every
hour
of
the
day.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
its
rates
could
be
raised?
