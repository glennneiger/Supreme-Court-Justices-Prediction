mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
the
court
please.
as
it
has
been
said,
this
case
grew
out
of
the
15%
increase
in
interstate
rates,
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
authorized
in
its
175
proceeding.
and
this
was
the
fourth
general
increase,
rate
increase
given
by
the
commission
since
world
war
iv.
this
rate
increases
have
not
been
granted
previously,
they
have
been
granted
because
of
the
constantly
or
gradually
at
least,
rising
price
cost
of
operation.
as
operating
cost
go
up,
revenue
has
to
also
otherwise
that
the
weak
roads
will
suffer
deficits
and
they
go
into
receivership.
and
the
stronger
roads
will
have
difficulty
in
financing,
capital
improvements,
purchase
of
new
equipment
which
is
necessary
or
desirable
to
increase
efficiency
and
improve
service.
now,
this
clear
statutory
authority
for
the
commission's
action
in
granting
this
across
the
board
rate
increases.
section
15
(a),
which
was
written
into
to
the
act
in
1920,
they
did
the
duty
of
the
commission
in
determining
or
prescribing
just
and
reasonable
rate
to
give
consideration
to
the
need
of
the
carriers
for
revenues
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
provide
adequate
and
efficient
transportation
service.
in
effect,
congress
recognized
that
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
preserve
the
economic
health
of
the
railroad
industry.
this
new
statutory
provision
was
prompted
by
the
par
less
condition,
credit
and
income
conditions
of
the
railroads,
following
termination
of
war
time
federal
control.
now,
the
results
of
the
railroad
operation
or
both
--
those
of
its
intrastate
and
its
interstate
operations,
it
was
therefore
appropriate
for
congress
when
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
say
it's
--
well
if
the
revenue
needs
or
determined
by
its
entire
operations
which
are
naturally
both
intrastate
and
interstate
and
when
congress
gave
the
condition
prior
to
adjust
interstate
rates
in
relation
to
revenue
requirements.
it
was
appropriate
to
give
it
some
control
over
interstate
rates
so
that
the
additional
revenue
derived
from
higher
rates
would
not
come
exclusively
from
interstate
commerce.
and
congress,
when
it
enacted
15
(a)
also
enacted
subsection
(4)
of
section
13.
and
that
section
directs
the
commission
if
it
finds
that
existing
intrastate
rates
aren't
justly
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
to
order
those
rates
to
remove
the
discrimination.
but
with
constant
railroad
commission
case
in
257
u.s.,
this
was
the
first
case
under
this
section
to
come
before
this
court.
the
court
said
that
there
was
dovetail
relation
between
13
(4)
and
the
present
13
(a).
and
that
there
must
be
equality
between
the
intrastate
rate
level
and
the
interstate
rate
level
if
interstate
commerce
was
to
bear
its
fair
proportionate
share
of
the
carriers
total
revenue
affirmance.
there
has
been
no
departure
from
the
meaning
that
was
given
by
the
court
in
that
first
decision,
to
section
13
(4).
now,
i
also
going
to
point
out
that
the
court
has
consistently
refused
to
construe
either
13
(4)
or
15
(a)
as
imposing
requirements
which
would
defeat
the
statutory
purpose.
when
revenue
and
expense
were
out
of
balance,
a
long
lay
in
correcting
the
imbalance
is
certainly
tends
to
defeat
the
statutory
purpose.
and
this
court
has
held
that
when
the
commission
is
acting
under
these
sections,
it
is
not
to
be
held
to
requirements
of
proof
that
are
so
exacting,
that
they
would
make
the
administrative
test
practically
impossible
and
would
paralyze
the
administrative
order
of
the
commission
and
thereby
prevent
the
prompt
administrative
action
which
these
sections
contemplate.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
certainly,
i
would
agree
on
that
and
of
course
to
us
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
certainly,
i
agree
to
what
you
said.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
certainly,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
it
was
a
very
considerable
hearing
as
the
record
here
would
indicate
before
it
was
on
the
action
taken
with
respect
to
the
interstate
rate.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
shown
that
the
operating
conditions
within
the
state
are
no
more
favorable
than
those
as
to
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
shown
that
the
existing
interstate
rate
level
is
below
the
level
of
the
interstate
rates
as
increased.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
second
point,
i
understood,
was
contested
by
appellants
in
the
brief
that
i
also
inter
--
understood,
mr.
rampton
to
say
that
as
to
his
evidence
both
ways
on
the
point,
he
was
not
pressing
that.
i
am
prepared
to
argue
it
here
if
the
court
wishes
me
to.
then
in
addition,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
all
right.
in
addition,
it
has
to
be
fair
that
the
rates
has
raised
will
be
reasonable
rates.
and
that
the
increase
in
the
intrastate
rate
will
in
fact
add
to
the
railroads
income.
it's
frequently
--
the
issue
is
frequently
raised
in
these
cases
that
if
rates
were
raised,
the
traffic
will
be
lost
and
there
would
be
no
income
return
and
sometimes
the
commission
recognizes
that
and
therefore,
it
does
not
increase
rates,
other
times
it
thinks
that
that
is
not
the
correct
conclusion
and
that
does
present
an
issue
that
has
to
be
passed
upon.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
don't
think
that
it
claims
the
first
and
i
think
that
it
claims
simply
that
the
railroads
have
not
established
the
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
don't
believe
they
could
in
this
proceeding
but
in
any
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
is
the
commission
has
to
find,
i
think,
before
it
can
act
that
the
state
conditions
are
no
more
favorable
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
would
be
the
--
yes.
it
would
be
the
--
the
effect
the
net
return
that
traffic
would
--
would
yield,
i
would
say
would
be
operating
conditions
and
that
would
--
you'd
have
to
take
it
into
account
all
tractors
of
operating
expense.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
certainly,
think
it
would.
i
think
that
that
would
just
apply
the
state
in
maintaining
a
lower
interstate
rate
on
that
particular
traffic
as
compared
with
corresponding
interstate
traffic.
in
other
words,
if
the
conditions
were
such
that
--
and
it
was
showed
and
established
that
the
--
the
nature
of
the
traffic
was
such
that
it
produced
special
economies.
i
think
that
on
that,
the
state
could
properly
maintain
a
--
as
i
say
a
lower
rate
in
corresponding
interstate
traffic.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
that
would
be
doubtful
if
that
result
that
you
suggest
could
be
doubtful
if
you
are
breaking
the
test
all
movement
within
the
state
of
utah.
now,
the
commission,
if
it
--
if
all
movements
include,
as
i
assume
that
they
would
in
your
question,
many
interstate
movements,
those
already
have
the
higher
rate
and
there
is
no
reason
to
--
in
my
mind
to
think
that
what
maybe
true
of
the
state
as
a
whole
will
establish
the
conditions
applicable
to
the
interstate
traffic.
the
traffic
which
is
--
with
which
we're
concerned
in
the
13
(4)
proceeding.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
the
ultimate
question.
certainly
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
it
follows
from
two
things.
one,
its
finding
that
the
operating
conditions
were
no
more
favorable
in
utah,
that
means
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
well
if
you
want
me
to
talk
about
the
evidence
where,
i
can
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
all
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
let
me
devote
myself
to
the
question
of
the
evidence
relating
to
similarity
in
operating
conditions.
officers
of
the
union
pacific,
in
the
denver
and
rio
grande
and
those
are
the
two
roads
that
carry
most
of
the
utah
traffic.
testified
that
in
utah,
intrastate
and
interstate
traffic
were
carried
in
the
same
trains,
same
cars
were
handled
by
the
same
men
in
every
respect
in
the
same
manner.
and
that
in
effect,
in
actual
operation,
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
were
inextricably
intermingled.
now,
where
you
have
one
transportation
system
serving
in
part
interstate
commerce,
in
part
intrastate
commerce.
that
would
seem
to
me
the
strongest
possible
kind
of
evidence
that
the
operating
conditions
of
the
two
are
the
same.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
could
i
--
wait
just
a
minute.
i
will
come
to
that,
yes.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that,
you
might
say
the
universality
of
the
facts
to
which
the
witnesses
testified,
destroys
this
testimony,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
strengthen
it.
it
doesn't
lose
its
probity
force
because
what
is
true
in
utah
is
true
in
other
places.
now,
the
appellants
did
attempt
to
show
or
introduce
evidence
to
overcome
this
proof
that
was
before
the
commission.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
proves
that
they
--
when
they're
operated
in
the
same
way
that
the
--
and
they're
on
the
same
train,
same
cars
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
no,no.
i've
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
shows
that
irrespective
of
the
proportion
of
one
to
the
other
that
you'll
be
paying
the
same
wages
to
your
train
crew
using
the
same
coal
per
turn
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
of
course,
it
would
in
--
in
freight
collected
from
the
--
from
transporting
that
number
but
the
question
would
be
whether
they
should
pay
at
a
higher
rate.
supposing
this,
we'll
say
$3
a
ton
for
the
interstate
charge
shouldn't
be
interstate
charge
where
the
same
services
performed
under
the
same
conditions.
they're
the
same
as
to
the
interstate
charge
and
assuming
the
same
distance.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
i
--
i
say.
but
i
think
that
this
evidence
and
more.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
in
a
situation
without
more.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
shows
that
whatever
expense
they
have
as
to
one
kind
of
traffic
is
applicable
to
the
other
because
they
handle
it
as
a
unit.
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,no.
it
does
not.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
it
would
not
i
think
bear
greatly
on
the
question
of
whether
the
operating
conditions
are
from
the
expense
put
were
different.
it
might
bear
on
the
--
on
the
revenue
received
and
if
you
have
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
here
on
then
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
under
some
circumstances,
it
maybe,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
when
these
identity
in
operating
conditions
is
established,
then
it
becomes
incumbent
to
show
in
what
respect
that
general
proposition
is
not
true
and
appellants
did
undertake
to
make
such
a
showing
here
and
they
gave
this
density
figures.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
it's
initially
on
the
railroads,
but
i
think
that
after
they
established
that
the
same
methods
are
used
in
both
inter
and
intrastate
commerce,
that
then
to
chose
special
conditions
affecting
intrastate
commerce
that
make
that
general
proposition
in
our
--
rest
on
the
--
those
who
are
contesting
the
application.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
--
that's
absence
in
showing
they
would
take
it
out
of
that
general
proposition.
now,
such
proposition
--
such
situations
you
gave
earlier.
let
me
say,
supposing
there
was
a
branch
line
running
from
the
mine
to
main
consuming
center.
the
traffic
movement
was
by
trains,
train
movement
regular
and
substantial
from
a
showing
like
that
that
would,
in
my
opinion,
justify
a
lower
intrastate
rate
for
that
branch
line
traffic
then
for
corresponding
interstate
traffic.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
because
of
the
identity
in
the
manner
of
handling
and
which
i
think
grows
out
of
the
fact
that
we
have
one
way
over
the
systems.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
serving
undistinguished
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
that
is
the
case
really
where
the
burden
lies.
i
think
that
when
you
establish
that
identity
and
it
might
not
always
be
true
then
i
think
the
burden
does
shift.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
maybe
various
things
that
might
be
shown
that
for
example
in
raising
the
interstate
rates
would
not
increase
revenue.
that
would
be
a
defense
if
it's
shown.
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
this
very
(voice
overlap)
track
competition
that
makes
--
that
in
effect
such
as
the
sealing
and
if
the
sealing
is
already
at
the
present
level
then
they
can't
go
up
without
losing
the
traffic.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
one
of
the
example
i
gave
earlier
of
special
conditions
is
to
--
as
to
certain
traffic,
branch
is
heavy
movement
from
the
mine
to
consuming
center
with
regular
train
movements
producing
operating
economies.
i
suppose
that
if
you
had
a
very
heavy
industrial
movement
from
--
then
it
might
be
circumstances
under
which
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
when
you
consider
that,
you
have
to
consider
the
fact
of
what
the
utah
commission
did.
in
nearly
all
prior
13
(4)
proceeding
which
at
least
those
which
have
come
before
the
courts,
the
state
regulatory
commission
has
authorized
an
increase
transferring
to
interstate
increase
except
as
to
particular
commodities.
now,
here
the
utah
commission
just
didn't
allow
it
on
anything
and
the
13
(4)
proceeding
then
involved
all
commodities.
in
other
words,
there
is
sweep
here
that
indirectly
is
due
to
what
the
utah
commission
did.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
rather
than
give
such
a
general
answer,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
traffic
density
and
what
it
really
signifies
because
that
is
the
factor
that
i
think,
mr.
rampton
stressed
more
than
any
other.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
where
you
show
differences,
it
should
be
shown
with
reference
to
what
is
intrastate
as
distinguished
from
interstate
rather
than
just
on
what
moves
within
the
state
is
distinguished
from
what
moves
somewhere
else.
now,
the
--
it
has
been
mentioned
that
this
--
this
density
figures
were
based
solely
on
main-line
traffic.
it's
perfectly
true
that
branch
line
traffic
was
excluded
in
both
sides.
that
is
on
the
system-wide
figures
and
the
state
figure.
but
without
the
total
trackage
certainly,
the
figures
are
uncertain
as
to
whether
they
really
reflect
operations.
but
i
think
a
more
important
consideration
is
that,
what
is
called
interstate
density
represents
all
movements
within
the
state
of
utah.
it
includes
the
utah
league
of
shipments
which
start
in
utah
going
to
an
out
of
state
destination.
the
utah
league
of
shipments
coming
in
the
utah
from
outside
the
state
and
the
movement
through
utah
what
is
called
bridge
traffic
which
goes
across
the
state
and
doesn't
have
either
an
origin
of
destination
in
utah.
now,
would
this
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
what
i
think,
that's
our
position.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
precisely.
you'll
find
the
record
support
for
the
statements
in
our
brief.
in
fact
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
don't
know
that
we
can
call
it
entirely
artificial.
i
wouldn't
go
as
far
as
that.
it
was
made
on
the
basis
of
whatever
move
within
utah.
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
systemize
figures
covered
their
entire
traffic
but
the
intrastate
figures
covered
not
what
was
really
interstate
commerce
but
interstate
commerce
plus
this
mingled
--
well,
plus
what
was
interstate
commerce
because
as
i
say,
came
in
the
utah
from
another
state.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
entire
system
figures
that
would
include
the
interstate
commerce
in
other
states
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
in
which
the
railroads
operated.
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
you'll
turn
to
page
21
of
our
brief,
the
first
paragraph,
first
paragraph
in
that
page.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
if
you've
turn
to
those
we
--
we
cite
record
293,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
of
the
record
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
mr.
rampton
said
that
he
agrees
that
that
is
so.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
intrastate
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
thought,
you
said
intrastate
rate.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
intrastate
rates
which
the
commission
imposed
of
course
apply
only
to
those
movements
but
the
intrastate
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
we
are
now
talking
about
this
density
figures?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
density
figures
include
the
utah
part
of
the
movement.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
the
correct
definition
should
be
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
some
of
it.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
that
is
the
real
explanation
for
that
extraordinary
difference
is
to
the
southern
pacific
in
the
density
figures
which
you
know
that
when
you
question
mr.
rampton.
now,
there's
one
other
thing
on
density,
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
lower
operating
cost,
is
the
number
ton
miles
transported
per
mile
of
track.
now,
take
a
case
where
--
where
two
trains,
each
of
50
cars
operating
within
a
giving
time
over
a
certain
track
and
at
the
same
time
over
another
track,
one
train
of
75
cars.
the
first
track
would
have
greater
density,
track
density
--
traffic
density,
there
would
be
hundred
cars
in
the
same
time
as
there
were
75
cars
in
the
other
line
but
would
have
higher
operating
cost
because
it
would
be
two
train
movements
instead
one.
now,
the
same
point
that
i've
made,
the
same
basis
for
computing
the
intrastate
density
figures
was
the
basis
for
computing
the
so-called
interstate
operating
ratios.
they
also
include
the
utah
leg
of
every
movement
coming
or
passing
through
the
state
or
going
out
of
it.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
the
commission
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
don't
think
it
must.
it
--
it
necessarily
has
to
take
in
to
consideration
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
test
is
not
just
discrimination
and
i
think
that
the
commission
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
at
least
is
the
initial
step
and
when
that
has
been
taken
then
i
think
the
burden
the
proof
shifts.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
it
would
have
to
show
that
--
for
one
thing,
it
would
have
to
show
that
in
fact
the
increase
would
bring
a
return
an
income
and
additional
revenue
and
it
would
have
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
no,
no.
the
definite
statistics
are
put
in.
they
made
a
study,
a
four
months
study
taking
one
month
in
each
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
so
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
they
have
to
prove
that
the
rates
will
be
reasonable
and
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
rate
is
raised.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
think
that
all
the
elements
that
are
there
for
reasonable
rates
must
be
considered
by
the
commission
in
the
13
(4)
proceeding
just
as
in
any
other.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
the
comparison
with
other
rates
on
the
same
kind
of
commodity,
something
about
the
volume
of
movement
and
all
--
i
don't
pretend
to
be
a
rate
expert
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
but
the
various
factors
that
would
be
considered
in
determining
reasonable
rates.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
discrimination
would
probably
be
the
--
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
would
be
drawn
from
those
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
i
think
that
there
may
be
many
circumstances
in
which
there
would
be
special
operating
conditions.
i
think
that
it
probably
could
have
been
established
here
in
--
what
i
see
in
the
evidence,
a
case
could
have
been
made
as
particular
traffic
for
a
lower
intrastate
rate
than
for
interstate.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
because
if
--
if
the
flow
is
much
more
fast
and
even
and
if
--
if
its
--
will
say
true
from
origin
to
destination
so
then
that
cost
stops
that
--
that
means
that
there
is
an
actual
--
actually
a
greater
return
at
a
given
rate
doesn't
--
on
some
other
traffic
which
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
--
that
means
that
when
--
when
that
is
established
then
you
have
to
show
your
special
conditions
which
take
it
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
take
it
out
of
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
at
least
we
--
at
least
the
court
isn't
face
with
that
in
--
in
this
case
because
there
was
a
testimony
by
officials
who
had
experience
who
had
been
in
charge
of
utah
operations
for
their
railroads.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
they
knew
the
conditions
at
first
hand.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
--
that
maybe
true
and
i
will
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
would
be
certainly.
normally
the
normal
type
of
railroad
operation
and
i
think
that
it
show
variance
should
be
--
there
should
be
affirmative
proof
of
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no.
there
is
--
the
facts
were
established
as
to
that.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
wasn't.
i
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
wasn't
in
the
court
either.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
details
of
that
case.
well,
i
just
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
--
that
--
that
should
be
affirmatively
show
that
that's
case
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
that
should
be
affirmatively
shown
where
that
is
the
case
and
that
--
where
that
was
affirmatively
shown,
it
would
might
establish
conditions
from
a
lower
interstate
rate.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
that
that
is
enough
if
this
--
if
there
is
no
rebuttal
evidence.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
yes.
