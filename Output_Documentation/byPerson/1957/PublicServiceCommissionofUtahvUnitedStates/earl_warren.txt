density

--
chief
justice
earl

yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
unit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rampton.
may
i
--
may
i
trouble
you
just
once
more
to
relate
these
statistics
to
each
other,
the
system
statistics
and
the
intrastate.
i
don't
--
i
didn't
quite
get
your
statement
on
it.
i'd
like
to
ask
first,
do
the
same
factors
exist
in
--
in
both
sides
of
your
exhibit
there,
namely,
the
same
factors
and
the
system
statistics
is
in
the
intrastate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
or
are
the
--
or
is
the
factor
of
your
branch
lines
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
they
have
no
bearing
on
it
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
will
you
tell
me
what
your
last
statement
was
about
the
branch
lines.
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
quite
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
all
events,
it's
your
position
that
if
the
statistics
do
not
include
all
the
factors
that
--
that
should
be
in
them
then
it's
--
the
burden
is
on
the
other
side
and
not
on
you
because
it
wasn't
on
you
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may,
mr.(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weston.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
don't
take
that
into
consideration,
aren't
you
back
to
the
--
to
the
point
where
we
started
when
you
were
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
--
whether
the
--
the
mere
raising
of
the
interstate
rates
gave
the
commission
the
right
to
--
to
raise
the
intrastate
rates
without
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
that
--
what
does
that
prove,
mr.
weston
as
to
what
the
cost
of
operating
is
intrastate
wise
and
interstate
wise
and
what
is
the
revenue
of
contribution
intrastate
wise
and
interstate
wise?
what
is
the
density
of
the
traffic
and
all
of
those
things?
how
does
that
general
statement
to
those
men
bear
upon
those
subjects?
will
you
just
dissect
their
statement
and
say
how
--
and
show
how
it
bears
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
don't
mean
by
that
that
every
train
--
every
train
has
both
intrastate
and
interstate
traffic
on
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
you
have
--
supposed
you
have
a
hundred.
suppose
you
have
a
hundred
intrastate
trains
and
one
train
that
was
interstate,
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
bear
on
it
very
greatly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
contribution
that
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
verify
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
important?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
it
essential
to
one
of
these
hearings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
was
the
burden
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
showing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weston,
may
ask
you
this
question
in
--
in
longer
line
that
justice
frankfurter
was
asking
you
about.
do
you
contend
that
this
testimony
that
the
railroad
officials
gave
to
the
effect
that
--
that
the
traffic,
intrastate
and
interstate,
both
went
over
the
same
lines
and
the
same
trains
meant
that
there
were
no
such
conditions
as
justice
frankfurter
mentioned.
namely,
that
on
some
--
on
some
branch
lines
that
there
might
be
transportation
of
cattle
only
on
--
on
a
branch
line
to
the
main
lines
and
so
forth
maybe
--
maybe
minerals
carried
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
the
testimony
of
these
--
these
officials
excludes
any
such
consideration
in
the
state
unless,
unless
it
is
rebutted
by
the
state
of
utah?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
burden
is
on
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
mr.
weston.
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case,
is
it
necessary
for
the
railroads
to
prove
discrimination
so
far
as
intrastate
rates
are
concerned
or
is
it
the
duty
of
the
appellants
to
show
that
there
is
no
discrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
must
be
one
of
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
haven't
answered
my
question
yet
and
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
have
to
prove
undue
discrimination.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
will
you
tell
us
in
your
records
what
proof
you
rely
on
to
that
effect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
tell
us
in
--
in
a
few
a
words
what
the
nature
of
that
testimony
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sohm.
