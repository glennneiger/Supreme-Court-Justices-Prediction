justice
felix
frankfurter
is
any
member
of
your
commission
sit
with
the
i.c.c.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must
have
been
notified
of
course?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
party
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
not
codification.
that
was
new
--
that
was
new
legislation.
that
was
not
--
it
could
not
have
done
that
under
the
shreveport
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
makes
an
important
distinction
mr.
rampton
because
under
the
shreveport
doctrine,
it
was
merely
--
interstate
commerce
commission
has
power
to
find
specific
discrimination
against
a
specific
rate
or
commodity
by
virtue
of
the
state
rate.
in
other
words,
the
area
of
jurisdiction
was
ever
so
much
more
restricted.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
case
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
--
would
it
trouble
you,
your
argument
--
the
order
of
your
argument
if
you
tell
us
now
what
specific
findings
you
challenge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
just
indicate
what
kind
of
issues
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
challenge
--
you
say
there's
no
support
for
that,
if
there
were
support
for
that,
would
the
conclusion
of
the
commission
flow
from
that
finding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
so
that
we
--
so
that
you
invite
us,
indeed
we
have
to
go
to
the
record
to
find
out
what
the
commission
could
on
this
record
have
reached
that
--
made
that
finding,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
a
little
bothered
by
this
rigorous
syllogistic
problem
that
you
put
to
us.
and
though
this
is
just
an
exercise
in
formal
logic
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
that
this
is
not
a
problem
in
arithmetic
or
mathematics
that
the
fact
does
--
elements
of
the
problem
will
awfully
dubious,
ambivalent
and
illusive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
let
me
ask
you
a
simple-minded
question
that's
maybe
has
no
bearing.
this
plot,
statistical
comparisons
leave
out
of
all
account
as
i've
seen
them.
the
difference
is
in
cost.
in
other
words,
you
may
have
less
density
over
interstate
--
i
mean
interstate
shipment
and
yet
the
burden
on
the
road
because
of
the
great
--
greatness
and
whatnot,
tunneling
and
so
on,
may
have
relevance
it
so
seems
to
me
that
would
not
be
reflected
by
these
figures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
take
me
into
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
know
density.
but
do
this
--
does
the
record
before
the
commission
takes
those
factors
into
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
maintenance
of
an
interstate
road,
if
you
please
perhaps
even
at
a
--
at
a
heavier
cost,
bordering
on
a
deficit,
is
very
important
in
the
national
system
of
transportation.
and
it
maybe
that,
i'm
not
saying
it
is,
i
don't
know.
i'm
really
inquiring
because
this
is
all
very
difficult
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
not
outside
of
utah.
the
condition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
comparing
utah
conditions
with
--
with
--
beyond
utah.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
beyond
utah
conditions
may
be
far
less
favorable
or
more
closely
and
yet
beneath
for
the
national
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
those
factors
all
involved
in
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
asking
for
enlightenment
and
not
for
you
to
rigor
these
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
those
relevant
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
plainly
(voice
overlap)
if
they're
not
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
quite
naive
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
have
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
deep
instinct,
you're
thinking
that
this
is
all
a
mathematical
problem
or
a
logical
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
sense
of
formal
logic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
you're
resting
your
case
on
that,
because
we
have
to
go
to
the
details.
but
i
wonder
how
much
more
complicated
the
details
are
than
these
figures
show.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
start
from
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rampton,
will
you
please
tell
a
stupid
color
and
i
don't
mean
to
--
to
be
falsely
modest
about
this.
why?
please
explain
the
practical
--
enlighten
me
why
the
density
of
southern
pacific
within
utah
should
be
12
million
and
the
system,
3
million.
four
times
as
much
internal
density
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
mean?
that
--
that
bothers
me
a
little.
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it's
four
times
as
much
but
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
must
have
some
meaning
otherwise
the
figures
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
repetitive
--
the
repetitive
movements
gives
these
figures,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
explore
that
a
little
bit
and
believe
me
that
i
have
despite
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
notion
what
i
think
about
this
case
but
i'm
trying
to
understand
it.
you
start
of
course
necessarily
that
the
roads
need
more
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
presupposes
that
if
they
didn't
have
more
money,
there'd
be
some
default
in
the
operation
of
the
road
as
an
interstate
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
investors
don't
get
--
you
need
some
investment
in
order
to
keep
the
road
going.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
need
new
capital,
you
need
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
replacements
and
all
the
rest
of
it
so
that
if
you
haven't
got
this
money,
something
would
happen,
i
don't
mean,
right
away,
quick
but
something
would
happen.
they
might
--
the
service
might
be
--
the
service
might
depreciate,
they
might
get
trains
off.
they
couldn't
raise
--
there
are
limits
to
which
raising
rates
as
possible
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
often
as
not
or
sufficiently
often,
it
dries
out
rather
than
begets
traffic,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
then,
to
what
extent
these
inquiries
are
addressed
and
adjunct.
to
what
extent
maybe
may
the
commission
take
into
account
that
they
finally
need
money,
the
interstate
system
need
money,
having
found
they
can't
raise
their
rates,
profitably,
it
would
it
dry
out
staff
that
consequences
would
follow
even
if
they
didn't
--
trains
off
or
limiting
the
traffic
or
what
not.
and
here
is
a
part
of
a
general
system
to
be
sure
for
constitutional
purposes
intra
versus
interstate.
no
one
believes
that
more
than
i
do.
nevertheless,
if
you
got
one
system,
making
a
lot
of
money
or
having
a
very
profitable
business
at
a
very
conditions
on
which
you
rely
against
the
conclusion
and
that
it
bears
its
fair
share
by
taking
some
of
the
fact
off
the
local
traffic.
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
constitution
because
you
yourself
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
postpone
the
constitution
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
until
we
have
to
get
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
that,
but
it
isn't
getting
its
share
because
it
can't
impose
a
greater
ex
hypothesi.
they're
going
to
be
logical
about
it.
it
can't
increase
the
rates
of
the
interstate
shipments.
i'm
supposing
this
thing
and
i
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
interstate
traffic
as
such
can't
bear
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
such
an
element
as
what
the
traffic
will
bear
in
a
legitimate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sense,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rampton,
you've
shown
to
me
a
delectable
interest
in
logic.
but
when
you
say,
it
can't
put
an
unfair
burden,
aren't
you
a
little
bit
begging
the
question
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
as
a
system,
if
the
maintenance
of
the
system
requires
necessary
funds
and
it
can't
get
in
by
raising
the
rate
on
the
mere
interstate
and
isn't
as
such
an
interdependence
between
intrastate
and
interstate
that
it
isn't
an
unfair
burden
to
say,
here's
the
profitable
part
of
the
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
i.c.c.can't
review
such
a
determination
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i'm
not
making
any
new
--
such
a
determination
which
naturally
is
influenced,
i
say
properly
influenced
by
a
state
commission
in
regard
to
mere
state
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
you
said
about
both
interstate?
i
just
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weston,
could
we
agree
as
a
starting
point
that
the
commission
could
not
in
looking
at
the
needs
of
the
road
and
finding
it
needs
more
money
and
raise
without
more
--
without
more
to
raise
the
rates
both
of
intrastate
and
interstate.
was
the
same
considerations
or
on
merely
on
the
same
basis
or
under
basis
of
the
same
data
by
which
it
raises
the
interstate
rates,
7%,
9%
whatever
you
wish,
could
we
agree
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there's
(voice
overlap)
required,
i'm
not
now,
getting
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
get
my
directions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
there
is
require
because
of
the
continuing
authority
recognized
in
the
regulation
of
intrastate
rate,
a
specific
direction
and
a
specific
justification
for
touching
intrastate
road
--
rates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
commission
--
and
this
court
in
addition
to
the
other
things
it
has
held,
had
also
rigorously
insisted
upon
as
--
emphasize
the
importance
of
being
specific
and
responsible
in
relation
to
the
rate
system
of
the
state
and
not
having
a
change
in
the
rate
system
of
the
states
through
merely
from
a
change
in
the
interstate
rate,
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
utah
--
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't.
does
utah
--
let
me
start
again.
there
is
an
area
within
which
a
rate
is
reasonable
or
range.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
all
agree
to
that.
does
utah
claim
that
the
rate
in
fact
would
be
unreasonably
high
or
does
it
merely
claim
it
for
the
utah
commission
to
determine
what
within
the
range
it
should
impose,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
challenge
the
reasonableness
which
is
the
last
point
you've
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
this
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weston,
could
i
ask
you
this
in
order
to
make
this
case
more
concrete
at
least
for
me.
would
you
mind
stating,
forgetting
all
about
law
for
the
moment.
would
you
mind
stating,
what
there
was
before
the
commission
that
justified
its
conclusion
that
utah
traffic
wasn't
bearing
its
fair
share
in
the
sum
total
of
the
cost
of
maintaining
this
system,
isn't
that
the
real
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
only
get
the
trouble
about
subsidiary
and
it
means
nothing
to
me
usually.
i
want
to
know
what
the
content
of
that
is.
now,
what
is
the
--
what
is
there
that
the
commission
established
justifying
it,
to
say
that
utah
didn't
bear
it's
bear
it
fair
share
of
the
southern
pacific
then
the
real
cost.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
--
that's
the
conclusion
but
what
appeared
before
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
what
we
finally
agreed
into
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
find
out
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
you
get
through
with
the
job,
density
more
favorable
or
less
favorable.
what
is
there
that
justified
and
say
us
or
justified
us
in
saying
that
there
was
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
meaning
by
that.
and
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
you
will
correct
me,
that
utah
wasn't
maintaining
its
fair
share
of
the
total
cost
of
this
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that
[laughter]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
i
--
i
think
i
know
the
meaning
of
all
the
word
you
brought
it
but
i
don't
understand
that
in
this
whole
table
between
intrastate
and
interstate.
there's
no
meaning
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
is
that
--
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
--
from
you
point
of
view
perhaps,
on
what
artificial
assumption
was
this
table
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
then
the
interstate
was
not
based
on
whatever
move
interstate,
is
that
right?
intrastate
maybe
descriptive
for
a
portion
of
an
interstate
road
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
interstate
is
not
descriptive
if
it
excludes
a
shipment
that
takes
place
not
wholly
within
utah,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
other
way
around.interstate
on
the
right
hand
column
of
that
table,
is
not
descriptive
or
what
we
usually
call
interstate
namely,
something
beginning
in
one
state
and
not
ending
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
going
outside
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
--
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
record
confirmation
of
what
you've
said
--
you've
just
said
and
since
mr.
rampton
relied
heavily
on
that
density
factor,
it
becomes
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
you're
saying
--
let's
see
if
i
understand.
what
you're
saying
is
that
which
is
labeled
intrastate
which
until
you
spoke.
i
assume
it
was
traffic
originating
and
concluding
and
terminating
in
utah
and
not
travelling
outside
even
that
--
those
exceptional
cases
and
coming
back
that
--
that
label
intrastate
--
intrastate
is
not
descriptive
of
such
utah
containing
traffic.
that
is
correct,is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
293
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
very
sorry.
it
is
the
first
time
i
didn't
hear
an
argument
that
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
intrastate
is
not
confined
physically
to
utah.
that's
what
you're
saying.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that
but
i
--
i
like
to
put
it
my
way
not
out
of
vanity
but
because
it
lies
at
in
my
head.
when
i
say
intrastate
as
against
interstate,
i
mean
traffic
that
begins
in
the
state
and
ends
in
that
same
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
that
is
not
what
is
covered
by
intrastate
on
this
exhibit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
includes
any
portion
of
traffic
no
matter
where
originating
so
long
as
it's
physically
transpires
within
utah.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
don't
know
what
portion
of
(voice
overlap)
of
the
southern
pacific
may
have
originated
in
california
or
where
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
take
judicial
notice
of
that,
if
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
certainly,
whatever
i
didn't
know
is
very
rusty
but
i
suppose
in
some
of
the
industrial
states
there's
not
an
inconsiderable
volume
of
wholly
local
traffic
carried

that's
in
this
case.
that
is
that
they
carry
those
kinds
of
traffic
on
the
same
train.
but
i
suggest
that
if
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
traffic
of
a
various
state
that
it
carried
on
separate
train
for
intrastate

interstate
traffic.

assure
you
quite
the

without
another

i'm
trying

call

being
troubled
of
my
remissness?
justice

well,
the
difficulty
that

you
may
have
the

of

well
how
does
it
--
justice

frankfurter
but
does
it
connect
with
some
road?

why
should
its

be
raised?

not
part
of
an
interstate

is
it

well,
i
don't
mean
economically
but
i
mean
legally.

it
can't
discriminate

justice

in
these

in
these
orders,

i
wrong
in
being
under

that

commission
in
making
these
certain
full
orders,
usually,
has
a
saving
clause
in
the

they
can
come
in
and
make
exceptions
to
it.

is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
do
appeal?
justice
felix

yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
conventional
form
of
the
order
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
--
they
didn't
discriminate
against
utah.
