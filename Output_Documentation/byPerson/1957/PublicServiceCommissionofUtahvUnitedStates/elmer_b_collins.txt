mr.
elmer
b.
collins
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
first
to
this
court
that
this
case
follows
a
pattern
that
has
been
followed
since
this
court
decided
the
wisconsin
commission
case
on
february
27th,
1922.
the
first
case
decided
after
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
rather
after
it
declared
the
13th
section
powers
and
exercise
them
in
that
case.
no
two
cases
are
identical.
there'll
be
variations
between
this
one
today
and
another
one
tomorrow.
this
court
in
that
case
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
grant
of
power
and
rejected
the
contention
that
the
federal
government
was
encroaching
upon
the
states
and
laid
down
the
law
to
be
that
whatever
encroachment
there
might
be,
i
mean
it
was
not
an
unconstitutional
encroachment
and
that
whatever
encroachment
there
were
was
in
--
was
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
an
adequate
national
railroad
system.
now,
from
that
day
until
this,
this
court
has
upheld
and
ordered
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
followed
that
pattern.
i'm
constrained
to
suggest
these
things
to
you
because
the
state
of
utah,
in
an
effort
to
try
to
frustrate
the
commission's
powers
under
section
13
of
the
act
is
resorted
to
all
sorts
of
free
arguments
like
this
density
of
traffic
thing
and
we
--
they're
much
pleased
with
themselves
to
try
to
break
up
the
pattern
that
this
court
has
followed
for
35
years
within
--
within
the
last
few
months
or
certainly
since
your
decision
in
the
king
case,
the
florida
case.
this
court
has
adopted
or
has
--
i'm
not
sure
over
the
mechanics
of
it,
granted
motions
to
affirm
decisions
of
three-judge
lower
courts
which
decisions
sustain
or
is
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
louisiana
public
service
case,
the
north
carolina
commission
case,
the
arkansas
commission
case.
now
all
those
three
had
been
affirmed
by
this
court
without
listening
to
argument,
without
taking
them
for
argument,
without
citing
a
single
decision
as
the
court
in
way
back
when
i
was
young
did
cite
some
decisions
in
a
per
curiam
affirmance.
now
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
in
this
case,
i
was
sorry
to
notice
so
many
questions
from
the
bench
employing
the
use
of
the
term
burden
of
proof.
in
this
case,
the
railroads
petition
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
please
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
question
whether
or
not
the
utah
intrastate
rates
do
as
claimed
by
the
railroads,
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
then
the
commission
sets
a
hearing,
the
railroads
come
in
and
submit
what
they
think
is
proof
of
the
discrimination
by
the
intrastate
rates
against
interstate
commerce.
and
the
in
this
case
as
in
all
the
previous
ones
they
showed.i
might
interrupt
myself
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
--
to
express
my
appreciation
for
your
observation
a
while
ago
that
the
jurisdiction
under
this
section
13
is
far
in
the
way
then
extension
over
the
old
shreveport
jurisdiction.
the
thing
we
are
prone
to
call
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
in
these
cases
under
section
13
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
not
just
that
alone,
it's
a
--
it
is
a
matter
of
providing
revenues
sufficient
to
enable
the
railroads
to
maintain
an
adequate
national
railroad
transportation
system
which
was
a
matter
of
such
concern
to
congress
that
they
decided
that
they
put
a
stop
to
the
state
commissions
from
forcing
undue
preference
of
its
state
traffic
and
that's
the
history
of
the
1920
transportation
act.
we
prove
the
discrimination,
if
anybody
wants
to
read
the
record,
will
show
that
the
intrastate
rates
in
utah
were
lower,
except
of
few
rare
instances
and
those
who
will
be
save
for
the
saving
clause
in
the
commission's
order
and
report.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
against
interstate
commerce
and
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
--
that's
what
was
proved
here,
yes.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
--
all
of
the
--
the
oral
testimony
in
the
first
volume
until
you
get
to
that
testimony
which
identifies
itself
as
being
testimony
of
protesting
parties
those
who
protest
against
the
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
would
you
allow
me
to
refer
you
to
the
--
to
a
better
statement
than
i
have
time
to
make
of
it
which
has
been
made
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
report
and
nobody
--
are
opponents
don't
dispute
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
--
that
the
commission
has
properly
characterized
the
testimony
that
was
introduced
in
the
commission's
reports
begins
at
page
94,
volume
one
of
this
record.
you'll
see
that
the
commission
there
dealt
with
some
20
commodities
in
detail
as
to
volume
and
revenues
and
all
of
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
the
needs
of
the
revenues
were
going
into
the
fact
that
we
derive
from
intrastate
traffic
in
utah,
a
lower
ton
mile
reward
or
earning
from
hauling
the
traffic
of
that
state
then
we
do
for
holding
traffic
in
the
western
district
generally,
the
interstate
traffic
i
mean.
the
shipper
of
interstate
traffic
pays
more
to
get
this
traffic
across
the
state
of
utah
mile
from
mile
in
all
but
a
few
isolated
distances
then
the
intrastate
shipper
pays
for
a
holding
having
his
traffic
hold
from
inside
the
eastern
border
to
just
inside
the
western
border
of
the
state.
now,
our
lower
ton
mile
earnings
that
is
a
lower
compensation
for
the
word
that
we
do
in
hauling
this
intrastate
traffic
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
exercising
the
power
given
the
commission
under
section
13
of
the
act.
they
said
that
this
section
13
was
intended
to
make
states
traffic
pay
for
states
work
by
railroads
in
hauling
that
traffic.
now,
i
want
to
call
your
attention,
if
you
please,
to
the
fact
that
a
fair
return
as
such
so
that
the
investors
can
have
better
dividends
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
section
13
power.
it
is
that
i
said
to
make
state
traffic
pay
for
states
work
in
transportation
but
the
fundamental
purpose
has
been
stated
over
and
over
by
this
court
since
the
original
decision
to
maintain
or
to
produce
revenues
sufficient
to
unable
the
carriers
to
maintain
a
transportation
system.
and
now,
since
1933,
when
section
15
(a)
(2)
--
15
(a)
paragraph
two
was
amended,
congress
struck
out
or
rather
repealed,
remember
the
old
recapture
section
and
language
there
that
enable
the
commission
to
give
the
railroads
rates
which
as
nearly
as
maybe
might
earn
five-and-a-half
or
five-and-three
quarters
percent
return.
well,
that
wasn't
workable.
in
1933,
they
amended
that
to
in
--
in
this
present
language
to
require
the
commission
to
give
the
railroads
or
rather
to
take
into
consideration
in
its
exercising
its
power
to
provide
just
and
reasonable
rates.
to
take
into
consideration
among
other
factors,
the
effect
of
rates
on
the
movement
of
traffic
and
to
the
need
and
the
public
interest
of
adequate
and
efficient
railway
transportation
service
at
the
lowest
cost
system
with
the
furnishing
of
such
service
to
the
neither
revenue
sufficient
to
enable
the
carriers
under
honest,
efficient
and
economical
management.
now,
the
commission
has
been
delegated
to
duty
by
congress
to
the
make
the
determination
as
to
when
the
carrier's
revenue
for
national
purposes
and
for
all
purposes
is
inadequate.
the
commission
makes
that
determination
and
they've
not
let
any
of
that
power
as
such
to
the
utah
commission
which
seems
determined
to
try
to
usurp
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
jurisdiction
to
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
trans
--
more
revenues
are
needed
for
national
purposes.
i
did
want
to
say
to
you.
i
don't
know
whether
this
light
means
me
or
not.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
five
minutes.
thank
you.
mr.
rampton
with
his
ingenuity
has
picked
on
density
of
traffic.
i
wish
would
look
at
page
84
of
the
railroads
brief
which
has
a
slightly
lighter
great
cover
than
the
government's
brief.
and
you
will
see
why
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
not
accept
any
conclusions
drawn
in
the
--
i'm
referring
to
the
quoted
language
on
top
of
page
84
and
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
84,
yes.
the
discussion
that
follows
that
two
to
three
pages
in
that
brief.
the
commission
in
treating
the
testimony
introduced
by
the
utah
commission,
patiently
explained
in
each
instance
and
with
respect
to
each
item
of
testimony
why
the
testimony
was
so
undependable.
it
had
a
--
it
had
a
freak
or
phony
i
can't
think
of
a
defective
basis
because
of
the
annual
reports
and
the
method
of
reporting
that
the
utah
commission
forces
the
railroads
to
submit
to
it.
in
other
words,
they
forced
defective
and
misleading
and
erroneous
breakdowns,
they
want
to
credit
to
the
state
of
utah
the
--
the
revenues
allocated
on
a
mileage
basis
and
then
credit
that
states
into
intrastate
traffic
for
a
--
with
the
revenue
that
interstate
traffic
pays
for
crossing
the
state.
you
can't
--
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
hoped
that
this
court
could
sustain
a
doctrine
to
the
effect
that
the
utah
intrastate
shipper
is
entitled
to
have
lower
rates
just
because
we
have
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
little
traffic
moving
at
higher
interstate
rates
across
that
state
of
utah.
the
density
of
traffic
question
are
cited
at
page
--
well
i
forget
what
page
in
the
railroads
brief,
will
show
there
by
reference
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
annotated
the
publication
of
official
status.
if
you'll
look
at
the
decision
you
will
find
over
600
back
doors
or
elements
that
have
been
considered
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
have
a
relevance
in
the
determination
of
the
--
of
the
reasonableness
of
interstate
rates.
the
commission
is
though
in
its
exercise
of
the
section
13
power
determining
reasonableness
of
rates
as
such
in
utah.
it
is
already
laid
down
the
guide
as
this
court
said
in
the
king
case,
its
action
in
ex
parte
14
--
175
became
the
natural
basis
for
the
action
in
the
state
to
determine
whether
the
state
rates
in
utah
bore
a
proper
relation
to
income.
if
you
look
on
pages
52
and
53
of
the
railroads
brief,
you'll
see
illustrations
there
just
examples
of
the
rate
relationship.
they're
put
in
juxtaposition
to
each
other
to
show
you
what
was
before
the
commission
in
this
record
and
then
if
you'll
look
at
further
--
or
at
page
--
i
can't
locate
the
sentence.
it's
in
some
place
in
the
railroads
brief
where
they
--
i
quote
from
a
commission
report
as
far
back
as
1935
in
which
they
said
prior
to
that
date,
the
rail
--
the
intrastate
rates
in
utah
and
the
interstate
rates
in
traffic
to
through
and
from
the
state
and
in
adjoining
areas
was
generally
on
--
on
approximately
equal
level.
now,
utah
commission
and
none
of
the
opposing
shippers
have
cited
you
to
anything
that
has
brought
about
the
change
in
the
rates
or
any
reason
why
if
--
as
the
commission
made
the
finding
there
then
and
nobody
is
the
position
now
to
challenge
it,
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
in
the
proceeding
before
you
now.
and
nothing
has
happened
following
the
constant
increases
since
1946
when
they
went
into
this
inflationary
spiral.
nothing
--
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
to
bring
the
two
sets
of
rates
intrastate
and
interstate
out
of
the
line
and
to
each
other
is
the
refusal
of
the
utah
commission
to
go
along
with
the
interstate
commerce
commissions
finding
that
such
and
such
revenue
is
needed
for
the
maintenance
of
the
(inaudible).
you'll
find
no
law
that
says
that
the
commission
must
have
a
--
have
evidence
of
density
of
traffic
in
order
to
render
a
decision
at
all.
i
thank
you.
