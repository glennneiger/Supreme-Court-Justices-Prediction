you
mean
the
ultimate
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
may
i
ask
in
that
same
connection.
i'm
looking
at
page
118
and
119
of
the
record.
by
numbers,
which
of
those
findings
are
involved
under
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
your
--
your
minor
premise
is
all
factors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
there
are
several
hundred
actual
factors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
disorganize
your
argument
now
just
briefly
to
spell
out
what
you
consider
the
material
factor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
key?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
mean
really
is
to
lower
the
portion
of
a
fix
cost,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
can
you
tell
us
quickly
what
--
what's
the
contest
in
the
apportionment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
second
volume?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rampton,
has
the
commission
to
your
knowledge
ever
used
a
density
figure
of
this
kind
in
support
of
a
raise
in
intrastate
rates
on
the
13th?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let
me
ask
you
the
other
way.
do
you
know
of
any
interstate
commerce
determine
--
commission
determination
which
rejected
this
factor
in
the
13
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what's
that
proof?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
that
evidence
proved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
suppose
--
you
suppose
you
had
hundred
--
a
hundred
car
freight
of
which
10
cars
were
bound
interstate
and
90
cars
were
intrastate,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
i
--
i
would
suppose
in
return
the
90
car
intrastate
would
mean
very
much
more
to
the
railroad
than
the
10
car
interstate
traffic,
wouldn't
it,
even
though
they
have
the
same
train
crew.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
else
--
what
else
--
you
start
--
you
gave
one
that
increase
rates
might
lose
traffic
and
now
what
--
what
else
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
mr.
weston
as
i
understood
mr.
rampton,
he
isn't
offering
this
to
prove
any
beyond
that
indicates
that
there
was
a
reason
for
a
railroad
to
the
law
of
any
factor
which
was
not
develop
and
which
the
commission
didn't
require
them
to
develop.
and
as
i
understand
you
now
all
that
you
feel
that
is
required
within
the
definition
of
operating
condition
is
that
to
use
the
same
tracks,
the
same
train
crews,
the
same
billing
methods
and
same
billing
procedure,
if
you
established
that
and
at
the
same
--
those
procedures
apply
both
to
intrastate
and
interstate,
thereby,
there
is
a
established
in
identity
operating
conditions
from
which
in
the
absence
of
anything
from
the
state
commission
in
our
position,
there
must
follow
an
increase
to
the
interstate
level
of
the
intrastate
rate.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
asking,
must?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
railroad
application
for
increase
of
the
level
of
the
intrastate
rates
to
the
interstate
rate,
is
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
get
back
to
my
question
again,
mr.
weston.
do
i
--
do
i
correctly
understand
you
that
operating
conditions
in
your
view
or
what
i
define
them
to
be
the
same
rails,
the
same
cars
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
same
crews
and
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
supposed
that
all
appeared
in
this
whole
case
were
the
statements
of
the
two
officers
which
you
referred
us
to,
in
which
they
said
and
they
could
say
it
in
five
minutes,
we
used
the
same
crews,
the
same
rails,
the
same
cars,
the
same
tracks.
no
cross
examination
when
they
sat
down.
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence,
could
the
commission
have
increased
these
rates
up
to
the
level
of
the
interstate
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
(voice
overlap).
well,
how
do
they
establish
that?
through
statistics
or
what
or
just
an
officer
say
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
showing
that
there
would
be
an
increase
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
else
do
they
have
to
prove?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
goes
into
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
goes
into
that?
reasonable
in
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
the
elements
doesn't
help
me.
what
elements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
else
goes
into
the
railroad
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
--
from
that
--
that
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
make
a
case
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
places
of
which
there
could
be
an
interest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
that
come
down
merely
to
saying
the
reasonableness
of
rates
and
increase
of
revenues
is
really
all
they
have
to
establish?
because
everybody
knows,
that
in
fact
the
traffic
moves
on
the
same
rails,
and
the
same
cars,
build
with
the
same
procedure.
