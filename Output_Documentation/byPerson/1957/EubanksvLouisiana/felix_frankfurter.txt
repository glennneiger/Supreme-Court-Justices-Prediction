justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
beyond
the
knowledge
of
the
negroes
sitting
on
the
petit
jury?
is
that
--
how
long
was
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
actually
--
even
if
(inaudible)
the
negroes
sit
in
juries,
in
petit
juries
in
louisiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
judge
see
that
the
president
in
the
criminal
cases
challenging
negroes
from
sitting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
colored
man
under
prosecution
and
this
man
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
criticizing,
framing
or
blaming
you.
before
you
can
do
that
(inaudible)
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
bring
the
cassell
case
to
defend
from
your
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
bring
any
cases
of
this
court
on
the
subject
(inaudible)
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
court
itself
refers
to
the
reese
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
was
argued
before
and
what
was
considered
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
itself
relied
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
those
--
all
of
those
are
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
those
cases
went
on
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
the
information
that
you
--
which
--
apart
from
drawing
on
your
own
experience,
to
what
you
just
put
to
the
court.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
when
colored
folks
are
drawn,
they
ask
to
be
excused?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
culligan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
interrupt
your
argument
if
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
--
how
you
would
summarize
the
jurisprudence
if
you
just
canvassed
in
its
bearing
on
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
presumption
--
the
presumption
that's
laid
in,
in
this
case
is
that
over
a
period
of
time
you
will
tell
me
what
the
period
is
there
never
once
was
a
negro
on
--
on
your
--
on
the
grand
jury
of
the
new
orleans
parish.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that's
a
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
arises
--
that
would
stir
in
anybody's
mind
a
wiggly
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
rebuts
the
strong
presumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
very
--
what
shall
i
say
--
a
very
esoteric
or
very
onerous
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
potential
grand
juror.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now
in
this
--
in
the
record
that
we
have,
does
it
appear
that
this
last
question
which
you
say
is
left
up
to
the
court
that
there
had
been
instances,
sufficiently
significant,
in
which
the
examining
trial
judge,
in
fact,
examined
or
took
steps
to
inquire
whether
any
of
the
negroes
were
competent
with
grand
jury
service?
was
there,
in
fact,
a
rejection
of
potential
grand
jurors
among
the
negro
population
followed
on
specific
ad
hoc
examination
not
to
satisfy
the
criteria
which
bind
united
states,
has
to
enforce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
--
would
the
law
of
the
candidates
be
such
that
invariably
in
the
course
of
all
the
years
in
which
you
yourself
bring
your
own
experience
that
there
never
was
a
case
whereby
the
sequence
of
examination
there'd
turn
up
a
negro
who
was
competent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
negroes
in
your
--
in
the
parish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
have
that
--
but
that's
the
total
negro
population?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
of
the
total
negro
population,
how
many
--
i
don't
--
are
women
eligible
in
--
in
the
parish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
how
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
call
them
all
out,
how
many
males
abstractly
eligible
of
the
200
odd
thousand
on
deck
of
the
parish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
approximately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
settle
on
let's
say
not
less
than
25,000
abstractly
qualified
potential
negro
jurors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
no
matter
how
gregarious
and
socially
--
sociable
--
characteristically
sociable,
your
new
orleans
judges,
like
new
orleans
people
generally
are,
it
would
be
unusual
to
assume
that
they
would
know
all
of
25,000
negroes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
therefore,
it
gets
down
to
a
selection
from
a
pool
which
couldn't
be
within
the
abstracted
or
particularized
knowledge
if
the
judge
was
examining
these?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
would
have
your
--
they
would
have
your
answer
to
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
--
or
they
would
have
some
question
and
answered
by
other
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
that
true
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you
were
good
enough
to
quote
the
(inaudible)
to
further
what
i've
said.
i
also
said
that
if
the
guy
told
his
father
it
as
a
seven
and
11,
it
can't
be
act
of
nature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
will
always
happen
that
there
is
never
of
the
negroes
selected
and
there
are
25,000
people,
at
least,
to
choose
from
will
potentially
qualify
and
somehow
rather
no
negro
ever
turns
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
considerations
of
human
will
but
it
takes
a
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
now
this
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
reference
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
in
your
own
way,
how
it
comes
that
somehow
rather
in
a
city
that
has
as
many
negroes
and
presumably
one
(inaudible)
many
a
negroes
were
college
graduates.
many
a
negroes
are
substance
--
a
man
of
substance
in
new
orleans.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
13
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
believe
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
in
30
years,
the
(inaudible)
was
so
impersonally
operating
or
without
any
--
without
any
--
with
complete
indifference
to
some
pre-determining
selective
process
so
that
no
negro
will
ever
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposing
that
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
could
not
say,
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let's
say
irrelevant
to
give
us
the
local
division.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
every
one
of
those
--
everyone
of
those
excluding
or
excusing
consideration
that
you
just
indicated
is
offered
--
is
equally
as
to
comparable
professions
and
calling
by
white
folks
as
by
colored
folks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet,
somehow
have
a
void
for
if
you
get
on
the
jury
and
the
colored
fellow
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know.
but
no
matter
what
the
proportion
of
two
to
one,
three
to
one,
four
to
one
here
the
proportion
is
--
is
100
and
zero.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
that
is
in
the
record
testimony
of
mathematicians
from
tulane
university
that
the
law
of
kansas
would
operate
in
this
way
and
so
many
--
and
so
many
cases,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
duty.
i've
just
i
wondered
what
the
evidence
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
you
should
have
a
proportionate
representation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
this,
about
the
petit
jury.
you
do
get
your
colored
people
on
the
petit
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
they
get
on
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
--
like
in
petit
jury
some
are
rather
by
a
selective
process
to
get
on
in
that
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
they
actually
serve
on
petit
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
some
are
rather
did
have
selective
chance
system,
doesn't
exclude
negroes
for
the
petit
jury
but
some
other
way,
it
operates
or
is
operating
by
the
ruthless
laws
of
mathematics
and
the
law
of
kansas,
the
law
of
probability
that
they
get
off,
but
they
do
not
get
on
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
in
the
selective
process
before
grand
jury
there
are
standards
of
competence
or
fitness
or
qualifications
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
tie
up
and
do
not
operate
to
get
to
the
petit
jury
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
he
may
have
stiffer
status
than
the
opposing
lawyers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
evidence
on
that
point
mr.
culligan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
evidence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
the
--
now,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
very
sympathetic
to
giving
broad
--
so
far
as
sympathy
has
anything
to
do
with
this
thing.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
of
law,
i
think
your
state
and
every
state
has
broad
leeway
in
the
selection
of
it's
juror
both
petit
and
grand
so
long
as
the
generalization
which
you
have
made
are
not
violative.
and
therefore,
it
give
that
a
situation
taking
from
myself
where
a
particular
class
constantly
will
asked
to
be
relieved
from
service
for
reasons
of
--
economic
reasons
you
surely
avoid
the
other
reasons,
that's
an
important
thing.
now,
what's
the
evidence
that
--
that
judges
say
it
would
be
futile
to
call
a
colored
fellow
for
a
grand
jury
because
he'll
asked
to
be
excused
and
the
judge
would
think
it
desired
for
the
exclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
discretion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
discretion
implied
judgment
after
jury
got
with
all
the
relevant
factors
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
inclusion
the
--
of
potential
negro
jurors
is
also
a
factor
that
should
--
on
the
basis
of
which
discretion
choice
should
be
exercised
and
there
is
a
problem
that
is
raised
by
justice
black's
question.
namely,
how
is
it
--
how
is
it
that
the
raw
materials
on
which
he
had
although
it
has
this
large
negro
population
never
prevents
himself
with
the
choice
of
picking
a
colored
fellow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
there
may
be
--
then
there
may
be
--
that
brings
me
to
the
question
that
i
was
anticipating
in
my
mind
whether
it
just
carried
me
to
ask
of
you
and
i
would
totally
understand
because
i'm
doubtful
in
my
own
mind,
i
don't
mean
to
tell
you
it's
you
it's
non-trick
question
but
i
don't
know.
if
you
would
say
it
was
very
hard
to
answer
it
i
would
totally
understand.
my
question
is
this.
assume
--
assume
we
reversed
this
case
and
say
that
that
was
justice
black
had
been
saying
the
last
minute
or
so.
namely,
that
a
system
that
operates
--
that
a
system
that
gives
the
result
that
this
system
has
given
for
a
period
of
50
years
whereby
the
potential
colored
ingredient
in
the
grand
jury
that
two
out
of
which
selection
is
made
never
brings
forth
the
colored
grand
jury
and
there's
something
the
matter
with
it
at
some
stage
wherein
some
aspects
or
through
the
working
of
somebody
whereby
they
used
the
only
12
people
come
before
the
judge
who
will
select
but
they're
all
white
people.
that
there's
some
defect
to
the
machinery
somewhere
in
the
process
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
suppose
this
court
reversed
on
that
ground.
what
would
your
judiciary
or
the
attorney
general
if
he
has
any
jurisdiction
to
the
matter
do
about
such
a
decision?
or
would
they
say
we
can't
do
anything
because
these
are
the
operations
of
nature
i.e.,
mathematics
shows
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
maybe
the
list
he
gets
from
somebody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
put
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
process
is
of
which
ends
up
in
the
selection
of
12
people
to
be
your
grand
jury.
and
summing
it
out
of
that
process
over
a
period
of
50
years
has
always
resulted
in
the
absence
of
a
colored
person
in
a
community
that
has
the
colored
resources
in
which
you
take
just
pride.
so,
that
there
may
be
some
defect
--
somewhere
along
the
line
which
it
would
be
the
duty
of
somebody
to
--
to
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
pool
out
of
which
the
president
selects
judges
whether
in
a
court
or
any
other
court
is
a
very
small
pool.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
the
75
when
he
comes
out
of
the
--
what
you
and
i
agreed
are
not
less
than
25,
000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
may
i
suggest
this.
this
is
not
a
proceeding
to
mandamus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
district
judges
to
put
negroes
on
the
grand
jury.
this
is
a
specific
situation.
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
in
an
orderly
way
which
says,
“as
a
result
a
system
--
as
a
result
a
system
of
which
this
particular
petitioner
is
the
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
derogatory
--
being
a
victim”
which
involved
this
particular
petitioner.
it
so
happened
through
this
system
that
a
result
is
achieved
to
which
the
constitution
if
it's
achieved
not
the
man
who's
designing
to
protect
him
again.
and
therefore,
he's
complaining
about
this
verdict.
this
judgment,
dissent,
is
this
the
thing
--
your
judges
should
do
this
or
that.
it
says
your
state
should
do
something
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
culligan,
i
should
think
for
you
to
take
almost
we've
had.
i
was
--
i
was
so
honored.
i
think
we
should
take
judicial
notice
of
the
experience.
in
other
words,
we've
left
not
that
lower
court
narrate
by
mr.
justice
whittaker.
if
that
happens
and
we
have
records
in
this
court
that
leads
us
to
--
leads
one
to
refer
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice.
that
happens,
namely,
that
people
want
to
get
off
jury
duty
for
good
reasons
and
bad
reasons
and
the
different
reasons
they
do.
that's
almost
an
american
--
that's
one
of
the
charges
to
begin
in
my
point
of
view,
collect
charges.
one
aspect
of
american
justice
come
with
that.
but,
that
still
doesn't
get
to
the
point
that
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
happen
by
a
mere
--
of
the
law
of
probability
always,
so
as
to
exclude
a
negro.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
--
do
you
say
that
--
didn't
this
case
--
negroes
has
been
on
grand
jury
to
the
parish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
that
you
say,
since
this
case
you
mean
since
the
trial
since
1954
or
since
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
case
--
this
case
is
the
--
june
14.
the
arraignment
was
june
14,
1954.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
the
worry
off
your
mind
and
just
tell
us
the
concrete
facts.
[laughter]
since
1952
--
since
1952,
there
had
been
grand
--
negroes
on
grand
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
was
it
competent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
competence
of
negroes
risen
since
1952
in
new
orleans?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
merely
the
discovery
of
their
competence
was
written.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
did
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
did
that
in
my
view,
when
i
was
the
youngest
u.s.
attorney.
but,
it
didn't
happen
that
somehow
or
the
other
that
the
selection
they
made
always
excluded
the
negro.
it
just
didn't
happen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what
the
design
--
what
the
design
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
design?
the
design
means
some
conscious
plan
to
terminate
which
tends
to
test
consciously
on
and
consciously
carried
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
design?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or?
or
and
--
?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
--
why
don't
you
make
broad
--
why
did
you
not
make
then
a
broader
and
if
i
may
say
so,
easier
attack
on
to
select
on
the
jury
system?
namely,
that
there
wasn't
a
fair
representation
of
the
different
categories
to
the
population.
you
just
said
that
they
--
the
system
is
to
select
merely
men
of
substance,
broadly
speaking,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
the
defect
i
should
think
is
deeper
than
merely
excluding
or
not
including
colored
people.
and
indeed,
it
doesn't
--
it
can't
be
in
that
line,
it
must
be
men
of
substance
who
are
white
(inaudible)
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
is
--
is
that
true
of
your
jury
system?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
thought
everybody
except
people
who
are
well-known
in
the
community,
the
relatively
few
people
from
among
whom
they
select?
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
--
excluding
perfectly
worthy
and
competent,
otherwise
competent
except
they
have
no
substance.
and
--
and
or
colored
people
or
men
who
are
intrinsically
competent,
is
that
right?
now,
what's
the
evidence
for
that
apart
from
the
fact
that
no
colored
person
have
served?
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
that
fact,
apart
from
the
objective
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
knew
who
they
were
by
name?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
give
a
curriculum
vitae,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
district
judge
in
sitting
in
the
parish
of
orleans
are
localized
there
through
the
existence
of
a
parish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
the
only
reason
why
you
are
here.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
that
isn't
the
only
reason
that
you
are
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
ought
to
be
fair
to
yourself
and
your
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
i
ask
whether
you
to
turn
to
page
142
of
the
record
in
judge
o'hara's
opinion,
one
of
whom
the
third
whole
parish
where
he
says
in
the
selections
of
our
grand
jury,
this
court
approaches
the
selection
of
that
grand
jury
to
the
determination
(inaudible)
grand
jury.
it's
feasible
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
(inaudible)
record,
the
grand
jury
is
the
only
and
legally
(inaudible)
of
that
record
as
well
as
in
regards
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
the
final
result
was
no
negroes
on
the
grand
jury.
now,
i
do
no
more
than
that,
perhaps
the
lack
of
english
words,
what
means
to
me
that
(inaudible)
exceptional
colored
men
under
this,
the
white
man
and
by
the
choice
of
his
own
testimony
is
to
select
people
fit
for
grand
jury
service,
he
did
imply
among
those
negroes
who
aren't
so
fit.
but
didn't
begin
to
exclude
them
on
the
theory
that
no
negro
could
be
fit
and
therefore
there's
no
point
of
making
examinations,
is
that
right?
is
that
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
and
that
is
precisely
what
i
don't
want.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
that
paragraph,
what
does
that
paragraph
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
he
says,
there
are
as
a
final
result
there's
no
negroes
on
this
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
that
parish
that
he
recognized
it
would
be
wrong
for
him
to
exclude
negroes
at
a
class
where
he
makes
--
must
make
an
individualized
judgment
of
the
negroes
on
the
list
and
exercise
that
individualized
judgment
if
he
found
no
negro
qualified.
is
that
right,
is
that
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
definitely
(inaudible)
only
as
to
that
paragraph,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
didn't
throw
them
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
probably
excluded
some
white
folks
at
the
same
time,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
give
reasons
other
than
the
fact
that
they
were
negroes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
you
come
to
what
he
says
on
the
next
page,
the
reason
(inaudible)
was
that
paragraph
in
the
context.
and
on
the
next
page,
on
page
143,
paragraph
4,
my
reading
of
it
is
he
contradicts
what
he
said
on
page
142.
namely,
that
he's
just
nominating
anyone
with
the
exercise
of
discretion
was
the
traditional
standard
of
selection
which
traditional
standards
would
ordinarily
eliminate
the
colored
denying
them
as
a
grand
jury
selectee
as
it
has
to
the
fact
that
the
system
would
eliminate
it,
the
colored
denied.
there
he
says,
that
they're
just
following
the
tradition
of
this
parish
to
keep
negroes
off.
but
in
the
paragraph
which
i
first
called
your
attention
to,
he
says
that,
let's
do
our
best
to
come
within
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
put
an
end
to
the
legal
individual
consequences
of
our
past
records
and
try
to
select
them
on
their
respective
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'd
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
try
to
understand
it
before
i
condemn
or
praise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
get
out
of
it,
it's
--
if
i
may
so,
much
could
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
they
did?
what
did
they
do?
and
why
they
did
it
and
why
they
didn't?
whether
you
can
overcome
all
the
facts
that
it
just
so
happened
that
they
couldn't
give
whatever
it
is,
no
negro
happened
to
turn
up
in
the
selective
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
after
what?
after
eubanks'
trial
or
after
the
decision,
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
fact,
would
you
say
that
that's
the
current
contemporary
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
you
are
really
saying
to
this
court's
--
it's
your
tradition
--
is
saying
to
this
court
should
give
constitutional
confirmation
of
the
reforms
that
were
set
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
it's
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
this
system,
your
breeding
point
is
in
part
at
least,
the
momentum
makes
for
its
adoption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
