what

did

show?

and
never
a

at

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
i
--
that's
why
i
asked
earlier,
mr.
garon.
i
think
you
told
me
that
there
is
a
discretion
in
the
selecting
judge
based
upon
his
judgment
of
those
who
are
the
better
qualified
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

now,
where
does
that
appear?
i
see
at
page
5
--
4
and
5
of
your
brief,
a
statute,
section
196.
is
that
the
one
you're
referring
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
that
--
that
merely
says
that
the
judge
in
the
name
submitted
that
--
in
the
75
shall
select
12
persons.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
one
i'm
looking
at
page
3.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that's
right.

justice

(inaudible)
deny
that
under
louisiana
law,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
a
discretion
in
the
judge
to
select
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
very
broad,
isn't
it,
under
your
law
in
the
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
it's
a
much
broader
discretion
than
the
discretion
of
the
jury
commissioners
from
selecting
the
large
panel
of
750,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
it,
so
that
your
--
your
burden
in
the
first
instance
which
you
established
that
within
that
very
broad
bounds
of
that
discretion,
then,
nevertheless,
was
in
fact
a
systematic
exclusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
we
previously
had
a
case
here
where
we
reviewed
the
matter
of
this
kind
whether
discretions
been
exercised
by
a
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
we're
not
concerned
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
jury
commissioners
here
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
there
isn't
--
i
--
i
don't
if
i've
quite
understood.
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
upon
whom
was
the
burden
to
show
that
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
garon,
do
i
--
do
i
correctly
understand
that
you
concede
that
the
selection
process
gives
the
selecting
judge
a
broad
discretion
to
determine
competency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i
--
what
--
what
strikes
me
is
this
statutory
provision
if
i'm
looking
at
the
right
one.
it
seems
to
use
competency
and
the
discussion
in
the
judge
competency
in
a
very
limited
sense,
more
as
a
disqualification.
the
way
it
reads
is,
“shall
have
discussion
that
decide
upon
the
competency
of
jurors
in
particular
cases
where
from
physical
infirmity
or
from
relationship
or
other
causes
the
person
may
be
in
the
opinion
of
the
judge,
incompetent
to
sit
upon
the
trial
of
any
particular
case.”
now,
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
competency
in
the
sense
that
you
and
mr.
culligan
have
been
debating
but
rather
competency
in
the
sense
of
a
disqualification
from
physical
and
fitness
or
relationship
to
the
parties
or
something
else.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then
you
are
telling
me
that
there
isn't
any
such
limitations
as
i
thought
might
be
implicit
in
the
language,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you're
suggesting
then
a
competency
in
192
is
used
in
a
different
sense
perhaps
in
competency
in
172?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
question
is
the
definition
of
competency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
definition
in
192
or
172
which
is
rather
more
limited
than
in
the
sense
you
and
mr.
culligan
have
been
debating.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
not
--
you're
not
making
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
suppose
that's
important
what
--
how
significant
i
consider
it
if
your
supreme
court
has
passed
upon
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
me
this
mr.
garon?
has
there
ever
been
any
explicit
construction
of
competency
in
192
in
relation
to
the
more
limited
--
seemingly
more
limited
definition
of
it
in
172?
