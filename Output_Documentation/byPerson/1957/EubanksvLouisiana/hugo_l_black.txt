now,
you

if
this
statement
made
in
the

one
of
our
opinions
is
to
read,
how
would
you
answer
in
this
case?
one
of
your
selection
plans,
whatever
it
is,
operates
in
such
a
way
as
always
to
result
and
speak
and
long
convenient
exclusion
of
any
representative
at
all
from
a
large
group
of
negroes
or
any
other
racial
group
indictment
and
verdict
(inaudible)
by
a
jury
thus
selected
(inaudible)
how
would
you
answer
that
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
is
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
a
strong
--
strong
presumption
after
all
of
this
length
of
time
in
the
admission
that
there
are
people
who
are
competent.
what
we
said
was,
maybe
it
was
too
strong
and
maybe
you
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
made
a
plan
whatever
it
is,
operated
in
such
ways
as
always
the
result
of
free
and
long
continued
exclusions
of
any
representatives
at
all
from
a
large
group
of
negroes
or
any
other
races
with
indictments
and

returned
against
them
by
juries
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
answer
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
modified
that
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
concurred
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
opinion
from
which
i've
just
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
must
be
a
movement
however
in
--
in
the
direction
of
the
importance
to
prove
that
cassell
case
that
if
they
took
some
--
if
they
got
(inaudible)
i
cannot
understand
how
it
is
possible
to
attribute
to
execute
the
standing
of
physical
practice
of
50
years
and
always
reserve
to
the
exclusion
of
one
group.
i
--
i
don't
mean
by
that
if
you
are
right
in
saying
that
the
judges
are
honest
in
what
they
view
and
makes
this
right
whatever
it
is.but
how
can
you
attribute
to
the
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
while,
you
do
not
attribute
it
to
the
fact
that
they
are
not
competent
colored
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
however
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
particularly
if
they're
competency
is
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
about
competency,
do
you
--
do
you
--
is
there
any
reason
to
suggest
that
they're
not
competent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
your
difference
(inaudible)
but,
do
i
understand
now
that
you
were
saying
that
out
of
that
25,000
they
are
no
substantial
number
that
needs
to
be
competent
in
the
qualification
of
competency.

black
--
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
get
held
several
times,

i'm
wrong,
where

years
that
there
have
been
no

(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
show
why
they
didn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
evidence
show
that
there
have
been
grand
juries
of
a
federal
court
that
has
no
negroes
for
the
last
25
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
there
ever
been
an
absence
within
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
within
on
this
the

is
that
it?
justice
