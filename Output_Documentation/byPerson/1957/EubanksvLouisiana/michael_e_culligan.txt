mr.
michael
e.
culligan
good
morning
your
honors.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
the
court,
before
presenting
argument
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
permit
me
to
first
express
the
best
wishes
of
our
attorney
general,
jack
gremillion
on
his
request
to
also
thank
your
honors
again
because
of
the
consideration
which
your
honors
extended
to
him
on
his
last
argument
in
this
court.
again,
i
am
very
honored
and
privileged
to
address
your
honors
today
on
law
day.
this
case
is
typical
exactly
of
what
mr.
justice
clark
said
this
morning
in
his
telecast.
this
is
an
unfortunate
defendant
of
the
colored
race
without
funds
here
before
your
honors
in
forma
pauperis
with
both
the
record
and
the
brief
being
paid
for
--
by
the
united
states
government.
his
attorney
being
appointed
by
the
state
of
louisiana,
former
assistant
district
attorney,
a
high-minded,
high-spirited
young
man
of
our
city
who
is
now
the
assistant
city
attorney
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
whose
expenses
are
being
paid,
travel
expenses
by
the
city
of
new
orleans.
in
order
to
properly
present
this
case,
i
think
i
should
inform
your
honors
this
case
concerns
only
the
jury
system
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
the
case
is
properly
stated
by
mr.
garon
yesterday.
it
comes
before
your
honors
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
louisiana
supreme
court,
the
petitioner
having
been
charged
of
the
crime
of
murder,
being
a
young
college
youth,
and
the
victim
in
the
case,
being
a
white
woman
of
the
age
of
the
approximately
70.
the
alleged
motive
being
burglary
and
according
to
his
counsel
and
his
brief
before
for
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
she
was
brutally
hacked
to
death
by
both
blunt
and
sharp
instruments
and
finally
killed.
his
defense
in
the
lower
court
simply
being
that
he
attempted
to
burglarize
the
place
but
denied
any
knowledge
of
the
murder
itself.
there
are
no
constitutional
questions
involved
before
this
court
at
this
time,
except
that
of
an
alleged
discrimination
before
the
grand
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
yesterday
morning,
asked
if
there
was
specific
specification
of
error
by
mr.
eubanks'
counsel
and
my
desire
to
inform
justice
whittaker
that
on
page
37
of
the
record,
mr.
garon
in
his
motion,
of
course,
does
refer
to
a
violation
of
both
the
louisiana
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
he
further
particularized
in
his
brief,
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
its
specification
of
errors
that
it
was
a
violation
of
not
--
not
only
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
but
also
a
violation
of
article
1,
section
2
of
the
louisiana
constitution
and
of
the
congressional
act
of
1875
making
in
defense
for
anyone
to
deliberately,
purposely
exclude
any
person
on
account
of
race
or
color.
the
parish
of
orleans
which
is
the
only
parish
in
our
state
that
has
a
different
jury
selection
system
consists
purely
and
simply
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
the
territorial
limits
of
the
parish
of
orleans
and
the
territorial
limits
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
are
one
and
the
same.
again,
the
parish
of
orleans
differs
entirely
from
the
other
parishes
of
the
state.our
district
judges
in
the
parish
of
orleans
are
divided
into
a
civil
bench
and
a
criminal
bench.
in
other
words,
in
the
other
parishes,
the
district
judge
is
the
same
as
the
united
states
district
court
judges,
handle
all
types
of
law.
whereas,
in
the
parish
of
orleans,
the
criminal
district
court
is
strictly
a
court
exclusively
of
criminal
jurisdiction,
whereas,
the
civil
court
is
civil
and
probate
jurisdiction.
again,
on
a
selection
of
the
very
jury
commission
itself
and
the
parishes
other
than
orleans,
the
jury
commission
is
appointed
and
selected
by
the
district
judge,
the
clerk
of
court
being
the
ex
officio
chairman
of
the
commission
which
is
somewhat
similar,
if
not
entirely
similar
as
to
the
juries
as
far
as
the
united
states
courts
are
concerned.
in
the
parish
of
orleans,
the
jury
commission
is
not
selected
by
the
district
judge.the
jury
commission
is
appointed
for
a
term
of
four
years
by
the
governor
or
during
or
at
the
pleasure
of
governor.
in
the
parishes,
the
jury
commission
says
at
the
pleasure
of
the
district
judge
who
has
appointed
him.
again,
to
draw
distinctions
and
i'm
doing
this,
sir,
because,
the
cases
become
--
that
have
come
before
your
honors
have
never
arisen
out
of
the
parish
of
orleans.
there
is
no
case
ever
in
this
court
from
the
parish
of
orleans
on
this
particular
subject
matter.
the
number
of
names
that
go
into
the
--
what
we
call
the
jury
wheel
or
the
general
venire
is
different,
300
in
the
country
parishes
minimum,
750
minimum
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
again
is
different
in
the
country
parishes
than
it
is
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
in
the
country
parishes
out
of
the
300
names
that
are
in
the
general
venire,
20
names
are
selected
by
the
jury
commission
and
placed
in
an
envelope.
it
is
sealed
and
then
from
that
envelope
--
i've
gone
a
little
ahead
of
myself
the
names
of
those
20
are
placed
on
a
list.
the
district
judge
and
the
parishes
other
than
orleans,
selects
one
of
those
20
names
and
appoint
him
as
foreman
of
the
grand
jury.
out
of
the
19
remaining
names,
then
11
are
drawn
by
a
lot
of
chance
and
that
constitutes
the
grand
jury.
in
the
parish
of
orleans,
out
of
the
750
names,
the
jury
commission
takes
and
draws
700
--
put
750
names
minimum
in
this
jury
wheel.
mechanically,
it
is
a
large
very
ornate
brass
drum
that
is
about
the
size
of
a
oil
barrel
drum
that
has
a
manually
operated
control
handle
in
which
the
names
are
placed.
the
sheriff,
the
clerk
of
court
and
anybody
else
can
be
present
at
the
time
of
the
drawing.
the
wheel
is
simply
turning
around,
the
drum
is
rotated.
the
names
are
drawn
out
and
then
the
names
are
placed
on
a
list.
that
list
does
not
show
whether
there
are
black,
white
or
indian
and
we
have
indians
in
new
orleans
as
well
as
negroes,
chinese
and
whatnots.
now,
the
75
names
that
are
drawn
or
placed
upon
a
list,
again
that
list
has
no
indication
in
any
manner,
shape
or
form
of
the
color,
of
the
particular
perspective
jury.
the
list
goes
to
the
district
judge
and
i
will,
later
on,
in
the
course
of
this
discourse
show
how
each
one
of
the
judges
does
with
that
list
after
he
receives
it.
we
have
in
orleans
parish
at
this
time,
eight
sections
of
our
criminal
court
and
eight
sections
of
our
civil
court.
the
jury
is
picked
by
rotation
which
makes
today,
a
judge
select
a
grand
jury
once
every
four
years.
at
the
time
of
this
particular
case
there
were
only
six
judges.
so,
a
grand
jury
was
selected
once
by
each
judge
every
three
years.
now,
departing
for
a
minute
from
the
background
history,
i
would
like
first
to
explain
to
your
honors
the
similarity
of
our
laws.
in
other
words,
the
united
states
constitutional
--
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
is
the
equal
protection
clause
and
under
which
this
case
is
--
comes
up
was
ratified
in
the
state
of
the
louisiana
in
1868.
in
1879,
our
constitution
which
is
article
1,
section
2
repeats
practically
verbatim,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
part
of
the
louisiana
constitution.
again,
on
the
question
of
--
there
being
no
distinction
as
to
race
or
color.
we
antedated
the
congress
of
the
united
states
on
statutory
law.
i
have
quoted
the
exact
statute
in
our
brief.our
first
statute
was
passed
in
the
year
1868.
the
federal
statute
was
not
passed
until
the
year
1875.
i'm
saying
that
to
your
honors
for
this
reason
that
in
the
number
of
these
cases
this
court
has
commented
on
the
fact
that
certain
states
have
by
innovations
tried
to
let
us
say
evade
the
jurisprudence
of
this
honorable
court.
our
state
has
not
done
that.
we've
not
only
agree
with
the
united
states,
we
have
been
anticipated
the
united
states
on
this
particular
negro
question
in
criminal
law.
our
louisiana
supreme
court
has
followed
every
decision
that
your
honors
have
ever
written.
we
are
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
we
have
never
had
a
criminal
case
since
1938,
remanded
to
our
louisiana
supreme
court.
1938
was
the
famous
pierre
case
written
by
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
remember
correctly
sir.
and
in
1939,
immediately
after
that
decision
that
was
not
from
the
parish
of
orleans,
it
was
going
to
parish
of
st.
charles
where
an
entirely
different
system
of
jury
selection
was
in
effect.
the
jury
system
was
immediately
changed
in
that
parish.
pierre
was
retried
and
sentenced
to
death
and
hanged
after
again
an
appeal
taken
to
this
court
and
your
honors
approved
our
change
in
jury
system.
so,
we
have
followed
and
kept
abreast
of
every
case
that
has
been
spoken
of
in
this
court.
one
new
orleans
yesterday
has
the
part
of
cassell
case.
i
forgot
which
one
new
orleans
made
that
comment.
cassell
case
was
courted
by
the
state
in
its
brief
in
this
particular
case,
the
eubanks
case.
the
cassell
case
was
also
used
in
the
foundation
by
louisiana
supreme
court
and
i
think
the
case
of
state
versus
allan.
i
will
be
sure
about
the
name
later
in
which,
to
one
of
our
district
attorneys
immediately
upon
the
handing
down
of
the
cassell
case
said
that
they
were
on
the
wrong
track
as
far
as
the
interpretation
of
the
decision
of
this
honorable
court
and
immediately
had
a
grand
jury
thrown
out
and
a
new
grand
jury
empowered.
that
again
was
from
allan
parish
or
one
of
the
north
louisiana
parishes.
the
legal
situation
here
has
been
covered.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
in
all
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir,
not
all
the
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
all
capital
cases
under
the
constitution,
article
1,
section
9
sir
must
be
by
grand
jury
indictment.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
any
other
cases
are
just
by,
as
the
rule,
direct
votes
of
information
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
in
the
parishes
other
than
the
city
of
new
orleans,
the
grand
jury
is
used
in
practically
every
case,
but
in
orleans
parish
due
to
the
volume
of
business,
that
is
practically
used
today
for
capital
cases
and
for
investigations
of
great
public
interest
such
as
vote
frauds,
graft
in
police
departments,
mismanagement
of
public
funds
where
it
is
in
strictly
an
inquisitorial
body,
not
just
a
case
between
the
state
and
a
particular
defendant.
that
is
one
reason
why
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
few
minutes,
why
that
distinction
in
the
parish
of
orleans
is
against
the
other
parishes.
in
other
words,
our
city
is
the
largest
city
we
believe
in
the
south
and
(inaudible)
for
its
chamber
of
commerce.
but
we
sincerely
believe
that
we
have
the
largest
cosmopolitan
seaport
in
the
southern
territory.
we
have
been
abreast
not
only
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
but
abreast
of
the
times
as
far
as
law
is
concerned.
the
decision
to
this
that
i
might
also
say
this
inasmuch
as
your
honor
asked
about
that
grand
jury
proposition.
both
grand
juries
and
petit
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans
received
absolutely
no
pay,
no
mileage,
no
conversation
of
any
character
description.
therefore,
there
is
a
tendency,
it
might
say
psychologically
speaking
of
escape
by
particularly
our
colored
citizens
because
it
would
be
very
onerous
to
them
to
serve
on
either
petit
juries
or
particularly
on
grand
juries
without
any
type
of
compensation
and
i
say
particularly
on
grand
juries
because
the
grand
juries
are
in
employment
for
six
months,
20
times
to
meet
four
and
five
times
in
one
week,
whereas
the
petit
juries
as
rule
is
usually
a
maximum
of
about
12
days
service
in
one
month.
out
of
maybe
a
150
names
on
a
petit
jury
panel,
the
average
man
may
only
serve
one
case
and
then
he's
discharged
for
the
statutory
part
to
be
recalled
after
six
--
six
months
or
a
year.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
i
was
going
in
--
it
--
direct
me
in
the
record
sir,
and
what
i
intended
to
do
sir
if
your
honors
please
so
that
your
honors
will,
i
think
be
well
satisfied.
i
intended
reviewing
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
the
effect
of
the
jurisprudence
as
opposed
to
these
courts
has
simply
been
this.
over
30
years
since
1879
since
the
virginia
versus
rives
case
and
strauder
versus
west
virgina.
the
jurisprudence
has
been
built
up
is
as
it
were
over
30
years
it
has
been
a
continuous
lack
of
the
negro
either
on
a
petit
jury
or
a
grand
jury
that
that
is
a
strong
presumption
that
the
exclusion
has
been
quite
slow,
systematic
and
solely
on
account
of
race
and
color.
the
jurisprudence
has
also
we
think
that
that
is
rebuttable
and
that
is
why
i
stated
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
just
now,
i
will
review
the
jurisprudence
placed
and
then
from
the
facts
that
i
just
gave
you
which
will
be
from
either
the
whites
of
the
jury
commissioners,
that's
in
the
record
and
whites
of
the
former
district
attorneys
since
my
day
back
in
1928
up
to
present
day,
everyday
district
attorney
was
called
in
this
case.
every
district
judge
it
was
alive
was
called
and
not
only
now,
but
way
back
in
1941,
this
same
case
was
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court
the
same
factual
situation
in
which
these
same
judges
testified.
however,
that
case
has
never
come
up
before
your
honors
because
it
was
replaced
on
a
different
point
entirely
of
louisiana
law
and
not
on
the
constitutional
law
of
point.
the
case
of
akins
versus
texas,
the
majority
opinion
there
was
by
mr.
justice
reed
all
of
these
cases,
sir,
without
going
into
detail
or
naturally
capital
cases.
that
was
the
texas
system
at
that
time.this
case
was
in
1945.
and
i'll
give
a
more
elaborate
description
when
i
hit
the
cassell
case,
where
the
jury
commission
in
the
state
of
texas
in
interpreting
your
honors'
previous
decisions
in
i
think
pierre
versus
texas
and
possibly
the
smith
versus
texas,
one
of
the
impression
that
they
put
one
man
on
this
jury
panel,
the
grand
jury
panel,
that
that
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
rulings
of
this
court.
in
other
words,
the
jury
system
in
texas
which
the
plan
has
been
approved
by
this
court
in
cassell
versus
texas
in
which
is
a
self
--
i'll
give
a
more
full
explanation
of
later.
16
men
were
selected
by
the
jury
commission
out
of
which
12
were
then
taken
by
the
judge.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
that
one
token
representation
was
just
as
bad
as
none
at
all.
carter
versus
texas
was
way
back
in
1900.
in
that
case,
under
the
then
existing
texas
law,
you
had
to
challenge
the
grand
jury
before
they
took
office.
carter
committed
a
crime
after
the
grand
jury
took
office.
therefore,
carter
had
no
opportunity
of
challenging
the
grand
jury
at
all.
the
court
nicely
replaced
that
case.
cassell
versus
texas
i'll
place
on
the
side
at
this
minute
for
the
reason
that
cassell
versus
texas
as
opposed
to
its
approach
to
any
jurisprudence
either
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
or
in
your
honor's
court.
although,
there
is
no
point,
no
case
exactly
in
point
in
either
court
because
nothing
of
this
kind
has
ever
come
before
this
court
or
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court
except
in
state
versus
dorsey
which
never
got
before
your
honors.
in
gibson
versus
mississippi,
that
was
a
denial
way
back
in
1896
by
then
justice
harlan.
i
know
that's
not
new
orleans
but
it
was
that
justice
harlan
at
that
time,
he
wrote
the
majority
opinion.
the
removal
was
denied
on
the
basis
that
the
state
of
mississippi
were
not
disqualifying
the
negroes
from
the
jury
and
the
court
never
did
actually
decide
the
question
of
the
exclusion
from
the
panel
list
and
was
never
properly
raised.
in
the
case
of
hernandez
versus
texas,
that
again
was
an
exclusion
of
mexicans.
in
that
case,
the
court
found
a
systematic
exclusion
of
the
mexicans
because
at
no
time,
mexicans
had
ever
been
put
on
a
jury
list
of
any
kind.
the
court
said
that
just
from
the
time
alone
that
they
could
tell
from
the
name
that
that
was
a
mexican
descent
and
the
jury
commissions
themselves
might
have
been
unconscious
of
what
they
were
doing,
but
they
did
it
straight
on.
hill
versus
texas
was
in
1942
after
the
texas
law
had
been
changed.
the
--
again,
there
was
never
a
negro
on
the
grand
jury
list.
the
jury
commission,
however
had
to
pick
the
petit
jury
and
actually
the
general
venire
out
of
which
the
grand
jury
his
place
has
been
selected.
the
jury
commission
testified
that
they
did
not
even
know
a
single
qualified
negro
in
the
whole
city
of
dallas,
texas.
the
court
did
not
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt.
that
means
that
they
replaced
the
case.
martin
versus
texas,
the
defendant
in
that
case
did
not
get
any
jurisprudence
out
of
this
court
from
sufficient
reason
that
all
they
did
was
file
an
affidavit
and
offered
no
evidence.
neal
versus
delaware
which
was
the
case
back
in
1880.
the
court
--
the
state
court
refused
to
allow
the
introduction
of
any
evidence
to
prove
exclusion.
in
1935,
norris
versus
alabama,
that's
one
of
the
celebrated
scottsboro
cases
written
by
chief
justice
hughes.
there've
never
been
any
negroes
and
there
was
a
total
exclusion,
no
attempt
made,
to
ever
put
anybody,
any
negroes
or
any
type
of
jury,
grand
or
petit.patton
versus
mississippi
in
1947,
the
attack
there
was
made
on
account
of
exclusion
over
a
period
of
30
years
on
the
petit
juries
and
the
state
made
no
defense.
it
failed
to
make
out
any
--
give
any
evidence
of
exclusion.
pierre
versus
louisiana
was
in
1938
in
which
as
i
stated
before,
justice
black
wrote
that
opinion.
that's
from
the
parish
of
st.
charles
which
has
this
different
system
of
jury
selection.
in
that
particular
case,
the
district
judge
held
that
there
was
discrimination
but
along
the
lines
of
an
opinion
that
had
been
written
by
mr.
justice
jackson
and
then
as
much
as
the
attack
was
levelled
against
the
grand
jury
that
it
did
not
affect
guilt
or
innocence
and
therefore
could
not
be
prejudicial
so
he
refused
to
sustain
the
motion
to
quash.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
he
was
wrong
on
the
second
premise,
he
was
right
on
the
second
premise
but
he
was
wrong
on
the
first
premise
that
there
was
no
exclusion.
our
chief
justice,
our
late,
commended
and
beloved
charles
o'neil
decided
with
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
and
said
the
district
judge
was
absolutely
correct.
justice
black
agreed
or
i
should
say
can
claim
the
dissenting
opinion
of
our
chief
justice
in
which
justice
black
pointed
out
that
chief
justice
o'neil
was
correct
for
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
was
a
competent
lawyer
before
he
went
on
the
bench.
he
had
been
a
district
attorney.
he
had
been
a
judge
from
a
number
of
years,
and
he
certainly
knew
local
conditions
somewhat
better
than
the
other
gentleman
who
had
won
our
louisiana
supreme
court.
the
second
pierre
case
was
affirmed
by
this
court
because
as
i
say
the
jury
system
was
changed.
reece
versus
georgia
was
written
i
think
by
justice
clark.reece
versus
georgia,
we
say
with
honorable
pride
is
practically
a
restatement
of
our
louisiana
supreme
court
in
state
versus
nichols.
the
same
identical
principle
of
the
law
is
laid
down
10
years
before
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
state
versus
nichols
on
the
basis
that
the
--
the
case
actually
did
not
turn
in
on
the
point.
it
was
in
our
case
of
sate
versus
nichols.
in
other
words,
in
our
case
it
was
token
representation.
the
case
was
not
decided
here
on
that
point
but
the
logic
of
the
case
is
exactly
the
same.
rogers
versus
alabama,
again,
it
was
remanded
because
the
district
court
refused
to
permit
any
evidence
to
be
introduced
of
the
exclusion.
smith
versus
texas
in
that
case
in
1940
the
opinion
was
written
by
justice
black.
the
commissioners
in
that
case
--
the
jury
commissioners
said
that
they
just
choose
to
place
the
persons
on
the
grand
jury
list
from
among
their
personal
appointees.
that
they
wanted
to
claim
if
there
were
any
negroes,
therefore,
they
didn't
worry
upon
it
so
they
just
didn't
put
any
on
the
jury.
the
case
was
properly
reversed.
strauder
versus
west
virginia
was
in
1879
in
which
the
statutes
of
west
virginia
absolutely
excluded
the
negro
because
they
said
that
the
men
to
serve
on
juries
jury
had
to
be
white
males.
a
number
of
the
states
later
amended
similar
statutes,
cut
out
the
word
“white”
and
the
word
“males”
after
the
emancipation
of
women
and
also
putting
“females.”
now,
as
far
as
the
very
first
case
on
the
subject
in
this
court
was
virginia
versus
reece
in
1879,
100
u.s.
in
which
the
court
stated
that
while
the
facts
might
have
been
stated
that
no
negroes
were
on
the
grand
jury
or
on
a
petit
jury
have
ever
been
put
on
there.
and
how
did
it
--
the
jury
which
indicted
them
and
have
found
that
summons
to
trial
had
been
impartially
selected
that
the
test
was
not
a
mixed
jury
in
any
particular
case
that
that
was
not
a
sanction
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
and
a
right
is
not
given
for
any
law
of
virginia
or
by
any
federal
statute
to
have
a
mixed
jury.
complaint
in
this
case
while
theoretically
might
be
said
not
to
be
exactly
this.
i
say
it's
nothing
more
or
less
and
exactly
the
same
complaint
that
was
made
in
virginia
versus
reece
back
in
1879.the
complaint
is
that
there
was
no
negroes
on
this
panel
although
they
could've
been.
the
case
state
versus
green,
i
mention
state
versus
green
here,
this
is
a
louisiana
case
which
is
written
by
mr.
justice
mccaleb.
that
was
the
case
where
the
district
attorney
called
the
grand
jury
and
he
says
“gentlemen
since
the
cassell
case,
we've
been
doing
things
all
wrong
in
this
parish.”
so
the
judge
discharged
the
grand
jury
and
immediately
went
to
work
and
had
new
men
the
will
open
--
new
men
put
in
so
that
there
would
be
representation
by
negro
race.
in
that
case,
the
--
there
was
a
claim
inclusion
made
but
not
passed
upon.
now,
i
mentioned
already
the
words
of
justice
black
--
mr.
justice
black
in
the
pierre
case.
also,
as
i
mentioned
the
case
of
state
versus
nichols,
a
louisiana
case,
mr.
justice
morris
out
of
avoyelles
parish,
where
out
of
the
panel
of
300,
only
there
was
--
there
was
only
three
negroes.
the
clerk
of
court
was
the
ex
officio
jury
commissioner
in
that
case
testified
that
in
his
opinion
no
negroes
ought
to
serve
on
jury.
so
justice
morris
very
promptly
reversed
the
case,
sent
it
back.
and
in
that
case
again,
showing
you
the
consciousness
of
our
supreme
court
of
the
impact
of
your
honors
on
our
jurisprudence.
justice
morris
in
that
case
placed,
i
might
say
somewhat
poetic
words
said
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
a
planet
into
whose
orbit,
the
vortex
of
all
the
judicial
opinions
of
the
entire
united
states
must
ultimately
pass
in
order
to
give
the
law
it
stated.
our
past
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir
i'm
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
we're
very
pleased
to
answer
any
and
all
questions.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
would
say
this
sir
that
it
gets
back
to
what
probably
your
honor
will
remember
that
your
honors
said
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
cassell
case.
the
issue
here
is
a
constitutional
issue.
and
in
every
case
the
constitutional
issue
can
only
be
decided
by
an
examination
of
the
question
of
fact
in
each
particular
case
and
whether
the
inference
or
the
presumption
can
or
cannot
be
rebut.
if
it
can
be
rebutted
then
has
the
state
rebutted.
if
the
state
has
not
rebutted
it,
we
are
out
of
court.
we
must
rebut
to
presumption.
there's
no
doubt
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
that
is
generally
correct
sir
with
some
dispute
in
the
record.
there
was
actually
one
negro
on
a
grand
jury
panel.
again,
i
say
psychologically,
with
the
escape
proposition
nobody
knew
the
man
mr.
walker
was
a
negro.
he
was
selected
by
the
late
justice
shabane.
mr.
walker
called
at
the
attention
of
mr.
koch
who
was
then
district
judge
who
was
--
i
mean,
who
was
then
the
district
attorney
who
was
now
district
judge.
mr.
koch
called
to
the
attention
that
judge
shabane
and
the
man
continued
to
serve
on
the
jury.
there
has
never
been
as
far
as
i
know
in
my
experience
back
to
19
--
i
--
i
didn't
testify
in
the
case
if
your
honor
please
but
i'm
only
answering
your
honor's
questions.
since
1928,
i
personally
don't
know
of
any
negro
ever
having
served
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes?
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
a
strong
presumption.
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
the
testimony
of
each
and
every
one
of
these
judges
plus
the
louisiana
law
itself.
in
other
words,
under
article
172,
the
jury
commission
must
qualify
each
and
everyone
of
the
men.
the
qualifications
for
a
man
to
be
a
jury
and
it
simply
they
must
be
21
--
at
least
21
years
of
age
in
accordance
to
that.
that
he
must
not
have
been
interdicted,
convicted
of
a
felony
and
that
particularly
is
the
qualifications.
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
in
other
words,
almost
any
man
that
--
that
has
gone
through
the
first
grader
that
becomes
21
years
of
age
and
has
not
been
found
insane
or
convicted
of
a
felony
is
eligible
for
jury
service.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
he's
a
potential
the
minute
he
goes
in
because
the
same
law
applies
to
both.
the
bottom
paragraph
of
172
does
get
in
to
what
you
might
call
rather
than
a
qualification,
a
question
of
competence
where
it
says
in
addition
to
the
above
qualifications,
the
man
must
be
of
well
known
good
character
and
standing
in
a
community.
that,
however,
is
from
the
jury
commission's
standpoint.
now,
from
the
judge's
standpoint
in
addition
to
that
admonition
to
the
judge
that
all
juryman
are
a
must
be
of
well
known
good
character
in
the
first
section
of
that
article,
the
proviso,
the
authority
as
to
the
competency
of
each
and
every
juryman
whether
he's
a
petit
juryman
or
a
grand
juryman
is
left
up
to
the
court.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
can
only
answer
that,
sir
by
saying
that
the
different
judges,
those
different
five
judges,
some
of
them
interviewed
the
entire
75
names.
in
other
words,
they
sent
to
everybody
who
was
on
the
jury
list.
others
did
not
do
that.
others
were
sent
to
maybe
20
or
30
that
were
on
the
list
and
interviewed
them
and
as
long
as
they
found
12
that
were
competent,
they
went
right
ahead
and
took
those
12.
so,
each
one
of
them
did
not
choose
the
same
system
of
--
of
selection
as
to
competence.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
think
that's
very
possible
both
mathematically
and
practically
sir,
for
this
reason.
the
testimony
of
the
jury
commissions
will
show
that
from
1938
on
after
the
pierre
case
that
the
jury
commission
became
very
conscious
and
had
an
awful
time
even
finding
enough
negroes
to
put
in
the
general
venire.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
roughly,
above
one-third.
i'd
say
200,000.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
oh,
i'd
say
that
roughly
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
for
jury
service?
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
they
must
volunteer
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
first.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
couldn't
say
that,
sir,
except
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
well,
i
could
only
by
approximation
say
this
sir.
it's
about
42,000
negroes
are
registered
to
vote
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
so
taking
that
as
a
criterion
sir,
those
in
order
to
vote,
they'd
have
to
be
over
21.
they
would
not
necessarily
have
to
read
and
write
because
they
can
register
in
our
state
under
an
--
in
a
--
under
an
illiterate
section
of
our
constitution
are
entitled
to
register.
and
then
it's,
of
course,
some
of
them
are
over
65
and
so
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
they're
humanly
impossible,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
except
from
the
standpoint
sir,
that
when
you
go
to
passing
on
competency
exactly
the
same
way
as
you
take
a
civil
service
examination.
they
can
pass
on
my
competency
without
--
or
seeing
me
and
without
--
and
would
have
known
whether
i'm
black
or
white.
in
other
words
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
but
you
have
this
situation
that
i
think
justice
whittaker
mentioned
yesterday.
on
this
list
sir,
you
have
the
name,
the
address,
the
telephone
number,
the
occupation
and
the
previous
service
that
these
are
a
petit
or
a
grand
juryman.
now,
i
say
that
as
your
honor
said
i
think
in
the
cassell
case,
that
possibly
that
method
of
competency
might
be
rough
and
ready
and
a
pragmatic
selection.
still,
there's
nothing
evil
about
it
and
nothing
that
violates
the
federal
constitution
sir
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
in
my
opinion.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
that's
correct
sir.
but
we're
not
rolling
dice
in
this
case.
we're
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
we're
depending
on
the
discretion
of
your
honors
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
well,
that's
possibly
true
and
it
has
to
be
a
determination,
sir.
in
order
to
make
a
selection
there
must
always
be
a
determination.
in
order
to
have
determination
you
must
have
a
discretion.
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
our
judge
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
our
judge
does
not
have
to
pick
out
the
25,000
names,
our
--
our
judge
is
only
picking
from
a
list
of
75
names.
our
jury
commission,
itself,
do
take
out
of
that
25,000
names
and
there
is
no
complaint
about
the
selection
of
our
jury
commission.
now,
the
75
names
that
come
out
of
that
will
come
out
of
the
will
by
a
lot
of
by
chance,
out
of
750,
not
out
of
25,000.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
we
have
13
millionaires
in
our
city,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
we're
very
proud
of
the
fact
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
that
we
have
a
very
good
population.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
that's
shown
by
the
testimony
of
judge
o'hara
in
the
dorsey
case.
he
testified
in
the
dorsey
case
way
back
in
1941.
in
the
dorsey
case,
we
took
--
put
in
there
1284
men
whose
names
was
in
the
panel
and
that
each
and
everyone
of
them
to
be
examined
that
was
in
the
general
venire.
judge
o'hara
in
that
case
testified
that
he
had
approximately
six
men
on
his
grand
jurors.
one
of
them
would
support.
several
of
the
others
asked
to
be
excluded
or
to
be
excused
and
the
balance
of
all
could
not
say.
now,
when
a
judge
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
he
doesn't
mention,
sir
and
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
report
so
i
wouldn't
want
to
give
my
personal
opinion
to
that
because
i'm
trying
to
stick
as
close
as
to
the
records
your
honor,
if
i
can.
i'm
not
trying
to
go
out
of
the
record
but
i
do
have
to
occasionally
call
on
my
own
personal
practical
experience.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
now,
in
the
--
to
get
to
that
exact
analyzation,
sir
in
the
instant
case
of
what
your
honor's
speaking
about.
mr.
dillon
was
our
jury
commissioner
down
after
1928
to
1940.
every
jury
commissioner
besides
mr.
dillon
testified.
in
other
words,
either
by
actual
testimony
or
by
stipulation
between
counsel
and
mr.
dillon's
testimony
and
has
to
be
the
same.
that
after
the
pierre
case
in
fact
this
is
before
the
pierre
case
when
mr.
dillon
was
first
sworn
as
a
jury
commissioner
back
in
1928.
he
went
to
the
then
district
attorney,
eugene
stanley
who
was
also
a
teacher
of
law
and
a
writer
of
law
books.
and
mr.
stanley
suggested
to
him
to
try
to
get
this
jury
wills
where
there
wouldn't
be
any
possibility
of
any
discrimination
being
and
always
before
any
of
these
courts.
mr.
dillon
said
he
did
that
and
that
it
--
he
was
complimented
on
for
a
wise
move.
now,
this
again
might
answer
partially
what
your
honor
just
asked
that
the
jury
commissioner
himself
excused
the
white
and
colored
attorneys.
we
have
plenty
of
them.
in
fact,
next
week,
one
of
our
assistant
district
attorneys,
a
very
fine
colored
gentleman
named
mr.
(inaudible)
will
be
on
the
staff
for
the
new
orleans
district
attorney's
office.
he
also
excused
the
colored
positions
of
which
we
have
hundreds
of
them.
we
have
one
of
the
largest
hospitals
in
louisiana,
the
flint-goodrich
in
which
we
have
some
very
competent
colored
positions
and
surgeons.
school
teachers
as
your
honor
will
read
the
record,
we
have
as
many
negro
school
teachers
as
we
have
white
school
teachers.
the
record
is
not
broke
down
as
to
whether
they
are
male
or
female.
the
school
bus
drivers.
and
our
law
itself
does
excuse
as
a
matter
of
law,
apothecaries,
the
paid
fire
departments,
commercial
travelers,
commission
merchants,
manufactures,
places
over
65
in
place
of
electrical
light
systems,
and
that
there
was
never
any
exclusions
on
account
of
color.
that
the
excuse
is
given
where
the
jury
commission
excused
and
applied
equally
as
well
on
the
count
of
the
economic
situations
to
the
whites
as
to
the
colored.
in
other
words,
a
man
who
comes
up
before
the
jury
commission,
a
barber
would
run
his
own
business
couldn't
possibly
afford
from
an
economic
standpoint.
so,
whether
he's
a
white
barber
or
a
black
barber
it
made
no
difference
to
the
jury
commission
nor
to
our
district
judge
when
they
will
put
on
the
grand
jury
panel
if
they
got
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
panel.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir
in
both
races.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
because
there's
a
difference
of
almost
two
to
one
in
the
economic
situation.
it's
not
exactly
equal.
in
other
words,
we
have
2000
lawyers
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
eventually
to
say
not
more
than
40
colored
lawyers.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
well,
that's
possibly
correct
sir,
i'd
say
12
to
one.
in
other
words,
six
out
of
75
in
--
like
in
this
case.
we're
going
to
six
numbers
--
only
six
colored
was
or
was
selected
by
a
lot
of
by
chance
to
go
on
the
list.
so,
that's
a
12
to
one
shot.
the
judge
has
to
take
12
out
of
75.
now,
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
the
duty
of
the
state
to
put
his
testimony
in.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
there's
no
such
mathematical
testimony
principally
on
account
of
the
fact
with
your
honors.
and
most
your
decisions
have
held
that
the
question
of
percentage
or
ratio
population
has
never
been
the
intention
of
this
court
in
the
selection
of
juries
but
only
in
the
absence
of
other
evidence
that
has
been
your
honors
ruling,
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no
sir.
i
understand
that
and
that's
why
i'm
qualifying
that
and
for
more
for
saying
it.
i
think
your
honor
subscribes
to
that
theory
that
the
proportional
representation
was
not
necessary
but
could
be
used
as
your
honor
is
doing
right
now
in
the
absence
of
any
other
evidence,
but
we
have
all
the
evidence
in
this
case,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes
sir,
time
after
time.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
they're
21
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
because
they
come
in
under
the
qualification
of
21
years
of
age,
able
to
read
and
write.
they
get
a
notice
from
the
jury
commission
and
they
walk
up
then.
the
jury
commission
says,
"can
you
read
and
write?"
in
one
of
the
commissioners,
"yes
sir.”
“you're
over
21
years
of
age?”
“yes.”
“have
you
ever
been
interdicted?”
“no.”
“have
you
ever
been
charged
with
the
felony?”
swear
up
all
of
your
writing
in.
he's
on
his
way
and
he's
qualified.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
now,
when
he
gets
--
when
he
gets
--
if
your
honor,
please
excuse
me
if
i
interrupt
you.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
when
it
gets
before
the
court
itself,
then
you
come
in
to
the
challenge
system
of
both
the
state
and
defense.
then
again,
you
get
to
the
discretion
after
the
preemptory
challenges
are
exhausted
on
the
challenge
for
cause.
then
a
judge
gets
to
a
question
of
discretion
again
and
unless
there's
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
selection.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
i've
seen
them
serve
on
petit
juries.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
i
say
there's
a
difference
between
competency
in
one
case
whether
it's
being
passed
upon
in
qualification.
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
because
in
the
petit
jury
system
the
--
the
district
attorney
on
the
one
side
goes
into
the
question
of
competency
so
there's
a
defense
lawyer
on
the
other
side.
now,
when
it
comes
to
the
judge
on
the
grand
jury
he
hasn't
got
two
counsels
one
on
each
side.
he
has
to
make
the
decision.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
he
could
have,
yes,
sir.
and
plenty
of
cases
i
think
they're
referring
to.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
that's
correct,
sir.
it's
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
there's
no
question
about
that
the
judge
in
the
petit
jury
proposition
is
never
antecedent
to
the
picture
until
the
preemptory
challenges
are
exhausted
by
both
sides.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
it
not
only
counts
for
the
fact
that
way
but
it
also
--
and
there's
another
way
that's
accountable
which
i
think
i
tried.
and
if
i
didn't
make
myself
clear
in
answering
mr.
justice
frankfurter
the
negro
himself
excludes
himself
from
the
grand
juries.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
say
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
the
test
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i'm
just
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
don't
misunderstand
me.
our
judges
have
never
refused
to
call
a
colored
person.
they
don't
know
whether
they're
white,
black
or
indian
from
that
list.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
one
judge
said
that
he
interviewed
all
of
them.
judge
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
he
would
know
(inaudible)
because
he
--
well,
no,
not
necessarily
this.
we
have
a
number
of
our
citizens
that
are
octoroons,
quadroons,
and
that
you
can't
tell
them
apart
and
the
names
don't
indicate.
they
have
black
sullivans
and
they
have
white
sullivans.
they
have
mr.
white
which
just
as
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
and
mr.
black
is
one
of
the
most
trustable
white
gentleman
in
our
city.
you
can't
tell
him
by
name
and
you
can't
tell
them,
white
parents.
it
would
all
going
to
be
intrinsically
impossible
like
it's
testified
right
in
this
case.
mr.
walker
is
a
contractor,
as
my
recollection
is,
and
mr.
walker
looks
like
a
white
man.
we
have
it
everyday
in
a
week.
now,
generally
speaking,
no,
you
would
be
able
to
tell
nationally
just
like
up
here,
sir.
you'd
be
able
to
tell
a
black
man
from
a
white
man,
of
course.
no
question
to
that.
now,
where
those
judges
do
send
a
form
they
can't
tell
by
color
whether
their
white
or
black.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
between
the
state
and
defense
that
if
a
hundred
particular
colored
persons
were
called
that
they
would
have
been
qualified
for
a
grand
jury
service
would
be
also
the
stipulation
by
the
state
that
the
state
could
also
dictate
a
thousand
other
names
besides
those
hundreds
who
are
also
qualified
and
also
were
never
called.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i'd
say
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i'd
say
that
that's
exactly
what
i've
said
to
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
was
there
would
be
a
strong
presumption.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
say
that
--
no,
sir,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
but
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i'd
answer
that
by
your
honors
decision
in
the
cassell
case
which
is
a
later
case
if
i'm
correct,
i
think
the
cassell
case
is
in
1950.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
think
the
cassell
case
modified
it
in
a
big
way.
the
cassell
case
was
written
by
justice
reed
your
honor.
and
mr.
justice
black
concurred
with
justice
reed
and
the
late
chief
justice
mr.
vinson.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
concurred
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
now,
that
was
the
first
opinion
or
the
majority
opinion
written
by
justice
reed.
justice
frankfurter
brought
a
concurring
opinion
which
was
concurred
in
by
justice
burton
and
justice
murphy.
i
think
that
justice
frankfurter
will
recall
and
he
started
his
opinion
off
in
that
case
since
1880
that
all
of
the
states
were
bound
by
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
and
i
think
i've
pointed
that
out
as
we
have
been
bound
and
we're
trying
to
live
up
and
we
believe
we
have
lift
up
within
the
statutory
limitations
in
the
selection
of
our
grand
juries.
in
other
words,
if
i
understood
justice
reed's
opinion
in
that
case,
there
was
a
deliberate
limitation
or
a
failure
to
acquaint
themselves
with
available
negroes.
now,
this
is
no
deliberate
limitation
by
our
judges.
this
is
no
failure
to
acquaint
themselves
with
available
negroes.
the
list
that
they
have
in
front
of
them
is
exactly
a
list
of
citizens,
not
first
class
or
second
class
citizens
of
louisiana.
and
it
said
duly
under
the
law
to
pick
12
competent
citizens.
in
other
words,
it
could
be
mathematically
possible
as
justice
frankfurter
mentioned,
it
could
be
mathematically
possible
that
the
75
names
going
out
would
be
all
called
and
our
judges
would
have
to
pick
12
negroes
or
vice
versa.
there
might
be
a
--
a
situation
where
you've
had
60
against
75.
that
is
simply
the
law
of
chances
as
to
who
gets
on
to
the
list.
the
matter
of
competency
though
is
what
our
supreme
court
says
and
i
think
that
is
your
honor's
jurisprudence.
this
is
of
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
my
reason
for
that
would
be
this
and
then
you
would
run
into
a
situation
of
token
inclusion
which
is
just
as
bad
as
token
exclusion.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
say
then
we
could
be
--
and
that
with
the
proposition
of
token
inclusion
just
as
much
and
total
exclusion.
in
other
words,
if
our
judges
want
to
wait
it
takes
nine
out
of
12
on
our
grand
jury
to
bring
in
an
indictment.
our
judges,
if
they
were
trying
to
be
hypocritical
about
this
matter
could
be
very
easy.
take
one
or
two
or
three
and
put
them
on
a
grand
jury
if
they
were
trying
to
be
hypocritical.
our
judges
are
not
doing
that,
so
they're
honest
gentleman.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
they
don't
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
and
you
would
have
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
if
we
took
three
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
if
our
judges
would
take
three,
then
the
next
time
we'll
be
apt
to
arguing
on
the
other
situation.
they
would
claim
that
our
judges
were
deliberately
including
and
therefore
excluding
whites.
so
we're
between
the
horns
of
a
dilemma.
in
other
words
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
don't
--
i
do
not
attribute
it
to
tax.
we
never
have.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
attribute
to
the
fact
that
the
judge
has
wide
discretion
when
he
faced
12
competent
men
that
is
his
duty
under
law
and
he
does
not
violate
any
constitutional
provision
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
the
state
of
that.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
that's
right.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
very
simply
sir,
for
the
reason
i
stated
a
while
ago.
he
does
not
have
that
large
25,000
peoples
to
select
from.
he
only
has
once
it
come
out
and
a
lot
of
chance
from
a
general
venire.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
unless
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
would
say,
very
--
very
honestly
to
--
to
your
honors
i
have
not
been
in
a
criminal
court
of
the
parish
of
orleans
in
a
number
of
years.
and
this
is
only
hearsay,
but
i
do
understand
that
one
of
our
judges
--
judge
o'hara
has
adopted
some
kind
of
a
theory
now
were
he's
trying
to
compare
the
competency
of
the
white
man
against
the
competency
of
the
negro
man.
to
try
to
prosper
--
eliminate
just
what
your
honor
has
said.
that
anybody
would
say
that
our
judges
must
be
doing
that
either
consciously
or
unconsciously.
part
of
my
point
in
this
case
does
not
claim
that
because,
exactly
the
words
i
think
of
justice
black
and
says
that
he
admits
that
our
judges
did
not
either
ingeniously
or
ingeniously
through
that
that
the
only
thing
that
he's
standing
on
is
the
fact.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
all
right,
sir.
then
i'd
say
that
that
would
be
a
--
not
matter
of
judicial
correction
but
of
correction
by
our
legislature,
because
we
have
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
federal
judiciary.
in
other
words,
i
say
they
wouldn't
claim,
it's
because
the
president
of
our
united
states
has
never
appointed
a
negro
judge
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
or
the
western
district
of
louisiana
that
he
has
discriminated
against
the
negroes
in
louisiana.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
that's
exactly
why
i
say
that.
so,
this
also
is
a
very
small
pool
of
75
men
out
of
which
the
judge
has
to
take
12
out
of
that
very
small
pool
of
75.
not
out
of
our
total
population
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
and
a
--
the
counsel
has
agreed
and
it's
a
matter
of
known
fact
over
30
years
that
since
1938,
we
cannot
possibly
be
criticized
because
we've
done
everything
that's
known
to
guard
a
man
to
put
as
many
negroes
competent,
qualified
negroes
and
that
will
as
can
possibly
be
done.
the
testimony
of
mr.
dillon
shows
that,
that
we
got
the
negro
list
of
all
of
the
different
negro
organizations
in
our
city
the
better
class
and
the
lower
class,
the
laboring
organization.
we
are
doing
everything
down
there
gentlemen,
to
try
to
give
the
negro
the
proper
representation.
we
are
not
bearing
down
on
them
on
a
contrary.
their
economy
is
our
economy.
we'll
hope
to
see
them
progress.
we're
trying
to
make
them
progress.
but
it's
not
our
fault
if
they
won't
come
up
to
the
competency
of
the
white
man
at
this
time.
maybe
in
10,
20
years
they
will.
but
we
hope
that
they
do.
we're
trying
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes
mr.
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir
they're
qualified.
i
think
the
term
used
is
“qualified”.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes
sir.
there's
a
big
difference
between
qualification
and
competence.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no
sir,
positively
not.
i'd
say
that
there's
thousands
not
a
hundred,
thousands
of
colored
people
in
new
orleans
that
would
be
perfectly
competent
if
they
got
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
into
the
jury
wheel,
then
by
a
lot
of
by
chance
were
taken
out
and
came
over
to
the
judge.
but
until
such
a
time
as
that
situation
exists
for
a
lot
of
chance
the
district
judge
can't
go
out
and
find
them.
it's
not
his
duty
to
go
out
and
find
them.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
all
right
so
my
answer
to
that,
sir,
is
simply
this.
it's
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
sir.
that
the
taking
of
a
result
and
then
reasoning
backwards,
forwards
that
if
the
result
is
this,
then
it
must
necessarily
follow
that
it
must
be
an
evil
proposition.
i
can't
agree
with
that
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
that's
important.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
correct,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
he's
notified
to
come
in
sir
on
the
first
morning
of
the
commencement
of
the
jury
trial.
for
instance,
our
jury
is
at
september
and
march.
he's
notified
to
appear
the
first
monday
in
september.
he
comes
in
at
the
same
time
the
petit
jury
felony
sits
up
in
the
courtroom
with
the
--
with
the
petit
jury
panel.
the
judge
that
tells
them
the
system
is
that
gentlemen
you
all
have
been
--
received
the
notice
to
appear
in
this
court
this
morning.
all
right,
hold
up
your
right
hand
and
then
he
re-qualifies.
now,
have
any
of
you
gentlemen
any
reason
that
you
would
care
to
offer
at
this
time?
come
up
to
the
bench.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
grand
jury
or
petit
jury,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
now,
in
addition
to
that
i
might
say
this
for
the
benefit
of
--
of
what
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
to
me
a
while
ago
about
the
pool.
in
the
federal
courts
in
our
city,
we
have
two
grand
juries
that
sit
two
terms
a
year.
as
your
honors
know,
the
federal
grand
jury
is
a
23-man.
the
testimony
in
this
record
by
mr.
donald
o'brien
who's
been
the
in
the
court
of
our
united
states
district
court
with
a
personal
friend,
a
high
class
gentleman
and
born
and
raised
in
the
city
new
orleans
is
the
same
as
i
am.
that
he
has
had
great
difficulty
getting
any
kind
of
a
jury.
now,
we
have
one
parish
to
draw
from.
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
has
32
parishes
and,
of
course,
we
have
a
new
orleans
division.
he
draws
from
orleans
according
to
his
testimony,
orleans,
st.
charles,
st.
bernard
and
occasionally
from
franklin
parish.
and
again,
over
his
experience,
he
only
gets
one
out
of
23
on
his
balance.
so,
he
has
a
very
small
pool
because
in
his
court,
50
names
are
drawn
out.
now,
as
your
honors
know
on
the
federal
system
the
minimum
is
16
and
the
maximum
is
23.
so,
they
have
to
go
straight
on
down
the
line
to
23,
at
least,
before
they
could
even
get
one
negro.
our
system
is
no
more
unfair
than
the
federal
system.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
there's
nothing
to
show
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
either
by
the
defense
and
again,
that
would
be
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
part
of
defendant
not
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
i
can't
say
whether
they
were
considered
because
judge
echezabal
in
his
testimony,
simply
says
that
he
don't
know
whether
they
were
white
or
black.
that
he
want
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
that
the
strong
presumption
will
arise
then
a
state
must
rebut
that
presumption.
then
i
say
that
once
we
have
rebutted
that
presumption
which
we
have
and
the
only
means
it's
possible
for
the
jury
commission
and
the
judges
that
then
the
defendant
has
to
go
forward
something
else
which
would
be
actual
proof
rather
than
the
inferences.
you
got
inference
against
inference,
presumption
against
presumption.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
comes
within
then
a
violation
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
federal
congressional
statute.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
on
the
--
mr.
dillon's
testimony
there
is
an
average
of
one
every
six
months
on
a
panel
of
23,
sir.
that
is
what
the
evidence
shows,
one.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
not
according
to
the
record.
i
wouldn't
know
that,
sir
and
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
according
to
the
record,
that
mr.
o'brien's
testimony
and
i
have
no
reason,
in
any
manner,
shape
or
form
to
doubt.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
judge
that
has
happened
to
my
experience
since
at
first
i
was
in
the
district
attorney's
office
and
when
i
started
off
by
saying,
“an
escape
tendency.”
a
man
who
have
one-man
business
don't
want
to
serve
on
grand
juries.
they
don't
want
to
lose
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
plenty
of
the
employees
and
the
employers
will
call
you
up.
and
ask
you,
“would
you
kindly
see
the
judge?
because,
they
can't
get
in
touch
with
me.”
and
the
answer
of
the
judge,
“kindly
excuse
this
man,
because,
he's
the
most
valuable
employee.
he's
the
head
of
the
accounting
department
or
he's
the
head
of
the
sales
department.”
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
the
judges
do
usually
cooperate,
sir.
right
or
wrong
the
judges
do
usually
cooperate
to
excuse
those
men.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
and
that's
the
system
over
the
entire
united
states
and
the
system
also
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
judge,
i'm
again
to
argue
from
there.
i
mean
i
don't
know
whether
it's
in
this
actual
transcript
of
testimony.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
well,
i
was
going
to
say
i
don't
know
in
this
eubanks
record
if
there
is.
but
definitely,
you
will
find
in
state
places,
dorsey
where
judge
o'hara
who
was
one
of
the
judges
and
one
of
the
judges
in
this
case.
but
judge
o'hara
made
that
statement.
you
will
also
find
a
statement
by
judge
platt
that
in
his
opinion
after
sending
from
and
he's
one
of
the
judges
that
send
for.
that
99
and
nine-tenths
percent
weren't
confident
to
say,
i
think
mr.
garon
admits
it.
that's
in
his
record
by
judge
platt.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
well,
that's
just
what
i
say,
sir.
i
don't
contend
that
this
is
done
by
chance.
i
say
it
is
deliberately
done
on
a
question
of
competency
and
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
by
a
district
judge
within
the
balance
of
your
honors'
jurisprudence.
thank
you
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
negro
grand
jurors
in
the
other
parishes?
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
we've
had
them
in
parish
of
orleans
since
this
case
sir,
i
know.
i
think
mr.
garon
will
tell
say
that.
and
i
know
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
say
since
this
case
we've
also
had
them
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
--
no,
sir.
not
that
i
know
of,
sir.
and
again
it
would
probably
be
for
another
reason.
if
you
have
a
smaller
--
we
have
300
names
in
the
wheel
out
of
which
only
20
names
are
drawn.
in
some
of
the
northern
parishes
you
might
have
that
where
the
negro
population
might
be
60%
against
the
white
population
of
40%.
in
some
of
the
parishes,
the
negro
population
while
almost
50%,
50%.
they
can't
--
they
can
read
and
write
in
french
but
not
read
and
write
english.
so,
they
just
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i'd
say
that
yes,
sir.because,
frankly
i
don't
know
in
every
parish
of
our
state,
sir,
i
wouldn't
want
to
make
that
is
so.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir.
i've
been
informed
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
i
mean
it.
i
think
it's
right
after
1952,
mr.
garon,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
and
right
after
1952,
which
was
prior
to
this
case
sir,
that
judge
o'hara
handed
down
a
decision
in
the
case
of
state
versus
dallas.
mr.
garon
had
not
made
that
part
of
his
record
and
i
believe
that
your
honors
you
should
know
that.
so,
i
agree
to
a
stipulation
to
permit
mr.
garon
to
put
judge
o'hara's
entire
opinion
in
this
record.
in
1952,
as
i'm
sure
that
that's
the
date
sir,
october
i
think
of
1952
which
is
part
of
the
trial
of
this
case.
judge
o'hara
reevaluated.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
well,
this
was
prior
to
that
sir.
where
the
negroes
were
placed
on
grand
juries
by
judge
o'hara
but
we've
always
been
worried
about
that
for
the
reason
as
i
just
said.
that
judge
o'hara
might
then
be
charged
with
deliberately
including
the
negro,
and
therefore,
deliberately
excluding
the
white
man.
in
other
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i'd
say
as
far
as
judge
o'hara's
selections,
yes.
since
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
wouldn't
know,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir
because
this
is
the
only
case
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
no,
sir.
since
--
since
this
is
the
only
case
that's
up
here,
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
questioned
before.
and
as
judge
o'hara
says
in
the
delaware
case,
it's
been
traditional
and
i
think
that's
just
exactly
what
judge
--
justice
whittaker
has
said.
it's
been
traditional
for
the
judges
to
pick
who
they
thought
were
the
best,
competent
men
to
handle
the
affairs
of
a
grand
jury
who
do
not
just
pass
on
guilty
or
innocent
but
they
also
constantly
pass
on
other
affairs
--
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
--
throughout.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
i
didn't
get
--
quite
that
part
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
it
wouldn't
be
any
incessant
so
they
could
pick
out
12
and
say,
“this
is
it.
period.”
so,
they
do
allow
in
our
state
and
your
honors
have
approved
the
system
or
selection
of
this
kind
in
the
cassell
case.
in
other
words,
the
only
difference
in
the
cassell
case
was
that
those
jury
commissioners
just
deliberately
said
that
they
didn't
put
any
negroes
in.
so,
you
couldn't
pull
them
out.
our
jury
commission
pulls
them
in,
but
your
honors
said
that
the
selection
of
12
out
of
16
in
texas
that
voids
identical
in
--
in
judge
reed's
opinion.
we
have
approved
of
this
up,
on
the
top
page
on
left
hand
side
of
page
3
of
the
opinion.
we
have
approved
of
this
plan.
now,
we
have
the
same
plan.
ours
is
12
out
of
75
against
12
out
16.
i
think
we'd
given
that
quite
a
margin.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
yes,
sir
i
thought
so.
(voice
overlap)
--
appreciate
very
much
your
kindness
and
consideration
and
may
i
express
again
my
thanks
to
your
honors
support.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
maybe
you've
been
listening
a
little
longer
to
need
what
i
should
have
spoken.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
well,
thank
you.
mr.
michael
e.
culligan
thank
you
very
much.
it's
been
a
great
honor,
sir.
