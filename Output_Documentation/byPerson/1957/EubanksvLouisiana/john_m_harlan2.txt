out
of
the
75
--
75
selected
from
the
750
by
taking
out
in
a
wheel
or
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
know
this
is
irrelevant
but
i'm
curious
about
it.
was
this
same
phenomenon
that
you
point
to
here,
rely
on
here,
namely,
absence
of
negroes
in
the
grand
jury,
is
that
obtained
too
in
the
case
of
petit
juries?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
do
you
have
negroes
sitting
on
your
petit
jury
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
is
that
i
know
that
in
some
jurisdiction
adduced
service
on
a
grand
jury,
besides
being
a
public
duty
is
in
regard
in
sort
of
a
social,
the
social
aspect
to
acknowledge
one
or
another
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
a
practical
matter
whether
your
statutes
here
reflect
that
kind
of
a
philosophy,
whether
it's
good
or
bad
that
somehow
rather
it's
a
special
privilege
to
sit
on
a
grand
jury.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it
would
be
true?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
wheel.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
did
judge
hart,
if
that
was
his
name,
why
did
he
decline
to
testify?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
he
the
man
who
decided
the
dowels
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
o'hara,
a
different
man?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
indication
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
not
true
that
in
the
selection
of
petit
juries
there's
nothing
comparable
in
the
stages
selection
to
what
your
have
in
grand
juries
namely,
that
the
judge
picks
out
12
men?
in
other
words,
their
names
are
put
in
the
box,
the
panel
comes
in
and
then
the
rest
of
it
is
between
the
lawyers,
isn't
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
there's
--
is
that
very
distinct
difference
between
the
two
methods
of
selection
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
might
account
with
the
difference
between
the
fact
that
you
have
negroes
and
your
petit
juries
and
not
in
your
grand
jury.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
are
white?
