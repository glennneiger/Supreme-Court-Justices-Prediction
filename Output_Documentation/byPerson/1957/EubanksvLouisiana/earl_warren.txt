mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
culligan,
may
i
ask
you?
are
--
are
all
of
your
cases
tried
by
--
are
prosecuted
through
indictment
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
all
--
not
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
some
of
the
judges
interviewed
everyone
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
would
know
certainly
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
culligan,
if
--
if
the
judges
want
to
be
fair
with
this
group
and
wanted
to
give
the
--
see
that
they
were
not
excluded
from
grand
jury
service,
why
shouldn't
they
see
them?
why
shouldn't
they
see
them
and
make
their
selection
when
they
do
know
that
they
are
not
discriminating
against
any
group?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
won't
have
to
be
--
there'd
have
to
be
the
danger
of
arbitrary
inclusion
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
the
judge
merely
take
a
look
at
all
of
them
and
--
and
asked
some
questions
to
find
out
whether
they
were
competent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
terms
of
services.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
mr.
--
mr.
culligan,
i
understood
counsel.
there
have
been
from
six
to
10
negroes
in
this
group
of
75
over
a
period
of
a
good
many
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
those
--
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
whether
those
people
will
serve
or
not.
they
--
the
--
the
jury
commissioner
has
picked
them.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
any
of
those
men
were
asked
to
serve
by
the
judge
and
beg
off
because
of
economic
or
other
reasons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
then,
let's
get
back
to
the
question
as
to
whether
they
were
ever
considered
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
mr.
culligan
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
culligan
in
the
--
in
this
case
where
the
judges
all
testified
as
why
there
were
not
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
with
their
--
any
testimony
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
reasons
there
were
not
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
was
because
after
being
drawn
in
this
group
of
75
they
implored
the
judge
to
let
them
off.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
counsel
shakes
his
head
and
he
says,
“there
was
--
there
is
nothing
in
there.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
culligan,
one
more
--
one
more
thing
i'd
like
to
ask.
in
the
other
parishes
which
operate
differently.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
negro
grand
jurors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
mean
prior
to
this
--
prior
to
this
case,
have
--
have
they
been
having
grand
jurors
in
the
other
parishes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
apparently
--
apparently
whether
--
whether
your
system
leaves
it
to
chance
as
you
do
in
the
other
parishes
or
whether
you
put
the
human
equation
into
it
in
--
in
orleans
parish,
they
failed
to
get
on
the
grand
jury
under
either
system
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
your
time
is
--
your
time
is
up
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
you
didn't
talk
to
you
once
you
were
answering
our
questions
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i
think
they
have
been
answered.
mr.
garon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
garon,
before
you
sit
down,
i
just
like
to
say
that
the
--
the
court
notes
from
the
transcript
that
you
were
appointed
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant
in
the
outset
of
this
proceeding
and
carried
it
through
all
of
the
state
courts,
and
carried
it
through
to
--
to
this
court.
i
--
i
would
have
you
know
that
we're
all
grateful
to
you
for
doing
this
because
we
--
we
had
a
great
consolation
from
the
fact
that
lawyers
will
give
their
time
and
attention
to
cases
of
indigent
appellants
for
this
matter.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
you
are
here
in
this
--
in
this
way,
on
this
day
which
we
call
law
day
makes
the
day
more
significant
for
us
as
well
as
the
people
of
the
--
of
the
nation.
and
we
thank
you
for
--
for
what
you
have
done
and
i
say
that
regardless
of
the
way
this
case
will
turn
out
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
of
course,
mr.
culligan,
i
--
i
would
thank
you
for
the
--
for
the
ardent
way
in
which
you
represented
the
interest
of
your
state
and
for
your
frankness
with
this
--
with
this
court,
and
very,
very
frank
with
us
and
everything
you
have
done.
well,
gentlemen,
i
thank
both
of
you.
