mr.
herbert
j.
garon
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
appears
before
your
honors
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
petitioner
is
a
negro,
indicted
by
the
orleans
parish
grand
jury
for
the
murder
of
a
white
woman.
never
in
the
history
of
the
parish
of
orleans
has
there
been
a
single
negro
who
has
ever
been
called
to
service
on
the
grand
jury
for
the
parish
of
orleans
within
the
memory
of
any
living
man.
therefore,
the
question
before
your
honors
is
whether
the
total
exclusion
of
negroes
on
the
grand
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans
constitute
such
systematic
exclusion
as
to
deny
to
the
negroes
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protection
of
the
law
as
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
in
louisiana,
may
it
please
your
honors,
no
person
is
held
to
answer
to
in
--
to
a
criminal
offense
of
a
capital
nature
unless
upon
presentment
or
upon
indictment
by
a
grand
jury.
in
orleans
parish,
which
is
new
orleans,
the
judges
select
the
grand
jury
consisting
of
12
of
an
original
750
member
panel.
the
jury
commissioners
select
the
750
from
all
sources
and
from
that
750
names
are
selected
75
names.
and
those
75
names
are
presented
to
the
court
that
is
then
presiding
over
the
empanelling
of
the
grand
jury
with
the
names,
the
addresses,
the
occupations
and
the
previous
history
of
grand
and
petit
jury
service,
and
from
that
list
of
75,
then
the
judges
in
rotation
every
six
months
select
the
eventual
grand
jury
consisting
of
12
citizens.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
take
those
from
the
wheel
and
we
have
no
quarrel
in
anticipating
your
question.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
manner
on
which
those
are
selected.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
there
were
six
negroes
as
was
proved
below
in
the
trial
court,
six
qualified
negroes
on
the
panel
of
75
originally.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
of
course,
we
--
we
must
read
the
minds
of
the
judges
of
the
individual
judges.
there
are
six
section
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
--
no,
sir.
the
qualifications
for
service
on
the
grand
jury
is
identical
with
the
qualifications
for
service
to
register
to
vote
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
qualifications
are
the
same.
there
are
no
additional
qualifications.
however,
the
judges,
within
their
discretion
according
to
our
statute,
may
select
competent
jurors
from
the
75
names
submitted
to
it.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
what
criterion?
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
criterion,
of
course,
has
been
established
by
the
judges
themselves.
as
long
as
they
--
as
long
as
those
who
are
on
the
panel
of
75
are
qualified,
the
judges
may
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
it
--
it
is
assumed
that
they
are
qualified
by
the
judges.
they,
themselves,
assumed
that,
however,
they
have
the
right
to
find
that
certain
members
of
that
75
are
in
fact
not
qualified.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
testimony
that
was
adduced
in
the
motion
to
quash
below,
judge
echezabal,
the
judge
who
selected
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
the
petitioner,
said
that
he
assumed
that
they
were
well
qualified
and
then
selected
12
of
his
own
choosing
from
the
75
without
regard
to
who
was
or
was
not
listed
on
that
panel
other
than
those
12,
as
i
will
go
into
more
in
detail.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
but
my
attack
--
may
--
may
it
please
your
honor,
is
that
the
12
were
selected
just
as
--
12
members
of
the
grand
juries
have
been
selected
by
all
of
the
judges
in
orleans
parish
from
time
immemorial
under
a
system
that
would
necessarily
exclude
the
negro.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
there
are,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
--
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
under
the
motion
show
--
showed
that
there
were
between
six
and
10
negroes
on
every
venire
of
75
for
the
last
25
years.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
and
never
a
selection
of
a
negro
with
--
but
one
exception,
which,
i
think,
i
must
make
clear
for
the
court
and
that
was
a
selection
of
a
man
who
possessed
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
white
man
and
who
was
mistakenly
selected
as
a
white
man
and
it
was
only
learned
that
he
was
negro
by
his
own
revelation
to
the
then
district
attorney
who
is
now
one
of
the
six
judges
of
our
criminal
district
court.
according
to
the
testimony
of
--
of
this
judge,
then
district
attorney,
this
man
came
to
the
district
attorney,
asked
the
district
attorney,
identified
himself
as
a
negro
and
asked
the
district
attorney
should
he
remain
in
this
panel
because
of
an
obvious
feeling
that
he
would
be
embarrassed
sitting
with
the
11
other
white
man.
and
this
district
attorney,
judge
koch
today,
brought
this
gentleman
to
the
judge
who
chose
him.
and
to
the
surprise
of
the
judge
who
chose
him,
he
was
identified
as
a
negro
and
they
decided
that
the
better
part
of
discretion
was
to
allow
him
to
remain
on
the
panel
trusting
that
it
would
not
cause
any
difficulty
during
the
ensuing
six
months.
but
except
for
that
exception,
i
think
that
--
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
here,
i
think
counsel
can
say,
certainly
without
hesitation,
that
other
than
that,
there
have
been
no
negroes
in
the
history
of
the
parish
of
orleans
ever
serving
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
supreme
court
in
this
case
did
not
justify
it
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
qualification,
unless
it
were
to
be
considered
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
says
that
it's
quite
proper
to
select
one
man
who
is
better
than
another
man
because,
according
to
the
supreme
court
decision
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
quote
this
from
the
--
from
the
supreme
court
shamefacedly
because
i'm
sure
that
that
is
not
the
law.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
saying
the
only
reason
negroes
were
not
selected
to
serve
was
that
the
judge
selecting
the
grand
jury
thought
that
the
white
person
selected
were
better
qualified,
which,
i
know,
your
honors
will
agree
is
--
is
not
the
criterion
for
selection
to
grand
jury
service
and
which
system
of
selection
would
--
has
obviously
excluded
defectively
the
negro
for
time
immemorial
in
our
parish.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
statute
leaves
it
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
select
12
competent
man
of
good
standing
and
the
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
correct
but
you
must
read
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
with
section
172
which
appears
on
page
3
of
my
brief.
in
the
last
paragraph,
in
addition
to
the
foregoing
qualifications,
jurors
shall
be
persons
of
well-known
good
character
and
standing
in
the
community.
the
person
may
be,
in
the
opinion
of
the
judge,
incompetent
to
sit
upon
the
trial
of
any
particular
case.
if
you
would
care
to,
i
would
--
i
will
read
quickly
the
section
172.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
and
provided
further
that
the
district
judge
shall
have
discretion
to
decide
upon
the
competency
of
jurors.
is
--
is
that
your
question,
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
shall
have
discretion
to
decide
upon
the
competency
of
jurors
in
particular
cases
where
from
physical
infirmity
or
from
relationship
or
the
causes,
the
person
may
be,
in
the
opinion
of
the
judge,
incompetent
to
sit
upon
the
trial
of
any
particular
case.
i
think
that
refers
to
a
very
particular
situation.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
they
may
--
there
is
no
distinction.
no
distinction
at
all.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir,
but
it
is
not
the
criterion
which
has
been
set
forth
by
the
supreme
court
in
this
particular
case,
our
supreme
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
--
there's
a
different
question
with
regard
to
petit
juries,
mr.
justice
harlan,
because,
of
course
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
we
have
negroes
sitting
on
our
petit
juries.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
i
think
that
would
be
true,
sir,
and
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
the
criterion
is
--
it's
a
traditional
standard
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
in
--
in
louisiana
particularly
in
--
in
the
great
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
traditional
standard
being
that
only
the
very
best,
the
vice
president's
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
of
the
banks
and
the
presidents
of
(inaudible)
incorporated
and
--
and
of
our
new
orleans
public
service
are
the
ones
who
are
endowed
with
the
right
to
sit
upon
the
grand
juries
and
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
he
is.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
he
does.
but
it's
quite
true
also,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
the
judges
who
are
distinguished
gentlemen
themselves
do
not
rub
elbows
with
any
--
any
but
the
president
that
i
point
out
who
have
the
right
and
do
sit
on
the
grand
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
jurors
have
been
conscientiously
placed
upon
our
grand
jury
wheels
of
750.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
mean
--
our
--
our
jury
wheels.
it's
the
same
components.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
--
the
will
that
contains
the
750
men.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
very
seldom
in
orleans
parish,
very
seldom,
but
i
can't
use
that
particular
phenomenon
as
an
argument
to
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
of
course,
in
all
fairness,
your
honor,
they
are
often
challenged
by
defense
counsel
in
orleans
parish.
and
for
that
reason,
they
do
not
frequently
sit
because
they
are
to
challenge
by
the
state
or
by
the
defendant.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
pardon
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes.
we
have
--
we
have
approximately
of
a
--
of
a
panel
of
150,
40
who
are
on
the
panel
and
they
are
called
indiscriminately
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
to
petit
jury
service.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
i
must
say
that,
no
offense.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
trial
technique,
sir,
it
depends
upon
the
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
now,
in
this
particular
case,
this
young
colored
man
was
indicted
as
aforesaid
by
the
grand
jury
and
the
motion
to
quash
was,
of
course,
raised
timely.
and
under
the
motion
to
quash,
evidence
was
adduced.
the
motion
was
denied
without
opinion
or
without
comment.
and,
of
course,
the
case
went
to
trial,
ended
in
a
conviction,
guilty
as
charged
in
a
death
sentence
by
electrocution.
the
case
was
appealed
timely
to
the
supreme
court
which
passed,
of
course,
on
these
questions
and
--
and
affirmed
the
conviction,
affirmed
the
sentence
to
the
lower
court.
we
applied
to
your
honors
for
a
certiorari
which
was
granted
last
october.
under
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
it
was
established
overwhelmingly
and
without
serious
comment
to
the
contrary
that
in
new
orleans,
there
are
--
which
is
orleans
parish,
one
and
the
same,
there
are
approximately
32%
of
our
population
who
are
negro.
it
was
established
that
of
those
32%
that
there
are
many
qualified
persons,
qualified
in
every
way
to
serve
on
grand
and
petit
juries.
it
was
established
also
that
while
one
in
the
same
time,
juries
in
the
state
courts
have
excluded
from
selection
negroes
that
the
federal
juries
--
federal
grand
juries
have
selected
negroes
to
serve
at
least
to
a
year
for
the
last
50
years.
it
was
established,
of
course,
that
there
were
28,000
negroes
registered
to
vote
in
the
parish
of
orleans
during
the
last
year
prior
to
this
indictment
and
it
was
significant
to
note
here
that
the
same
qualifications
to
register
to
vote
or
the
identical
qualifications
with
those
to
serve
on
grand
jury.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
we
have
--
we
have
approximately
three
times
the
number
of
white
registered
voters
over
colored
registered
voters.
now,
all
of
this
was
established
in
addition
to
the
establishment
of
the
fact
that
there
were
six
qualified
negroes
on
this
particular
grand
jury.
and
it
was
equally
established
by
calling
all
of
the
living
judges,
all
of
the
living
district
attorneys,
former
district
attorneys,
the
clerk
of
court
who
has
been
serving
in
that
capacity
since
1920,
all
of
these
people
were
called
and
no
one
in
--
could
testify,
of
course,
that
any
negro
ever
served
on
the
grand
jury
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
his
only
comment,
mr.
justice
harlan,
was
that
he
was
the
judge
of
the
case
and
therefore,
he
could
not
be
the
witness.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
sir.
that
was
judge
o'hara.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
all
of
the
other
judges,
however,
were
called
and
examined
by
counsel
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
now,
with
regard
to
the
--
as
i
say,
there
was
no
--
no
comment
on
the
part
of
judge
hart's
with
regard
to
the
motion
to
quash.
he
simply
denied
it.
our
supreme
court
said
only
that
there
was
no
discrimination
because
the
white
person
selected
by
judge
echezabal,
the
judge
who
selected
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
the
petitioner
that
the
white
persons
were
better
qualified
as
than
the
negroes
and
therefore,
no
discrimination.
now,
these
are
the
facts
and
this
is
the
background
which
we
have
to
lay
before
your
honors
in
asking
relief
in
this
case.
we
are
cognizant
of
your
honors'
ruling
time
and
time
again
to
the
effect
that
where
there
are
large
numbers
of
negroes
or
any
class
and
where
those
are
qualified
to
serve
and
where
they
have
not
been
called
to
serve
though
available
that
that
set
of
facts
alone
is
a
combination
of
facts
which
establishes
a
prima
facie
case
of
systematic
exclusion.
we
are
equally
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
the
burden
then
to
overcome
that
by
rebuttal
and
we
tell
your
honors
that
there
has
been
no
rebuttal
of
any
effective
and
nature
in
this
case.
and
we
also
say
here
now
that
we
are
cognizant
of
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
not
to
guarantee
that
there
shall
be
a
proportionate
number
of
negroes
or
any
single
jury
containing
one
or
more
negroes
but
that
there
shall
be
an
opportunity
to
serve.
and
where
a
law
does
not
provide
such
an
opportunity
for
all
classes
of
persons
to
serve,
then
that
law
will
be
stricken
down
by
your
honors.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir,
there
was.
there
was
the
usual
testimony
of
the
judges
that
we
are
not
prejudiced
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir,
but
your
honors
have
held
time
and
again
that
mere
assertions
of
public
officials
to
the
effect
that
they
have
followed
the
law
is
certainly
not
a
criterion
by
which
you
will
conclude
that
they
did
in
fact
followed
the
law.
and
it
has
been
said
by
this
court
that
if
such
were
the
case
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
be
just
a
vain
and
illusory
requirement
affording
protection
to
no
class
of
persons
who
happened
just
by
chance
to
be
a
member
of
a
minority
group.
and
this
is
the
type
of
rebuttal
that
the
state
will
have
to
offer
you
and
nothing
more,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
there
is
the
distinction
that
we
have
a
more
dignified
group
of
persons
who
are
doing
the
selecting
in
orleans
parish.
we
have
judges
who
have
presumed
that
the
law
is
correct,
the
way
in
which
they
interpret
it,
where
we
have,
on
the
other
hand,
jury
commissioners
without
the
qualifications
and
background
that
our
judges
have.
but
by
the
same
token,
if
there
is
no
real
distinction
between
selection
by
judges
and
selection
by
commissioners
when
the
judges
themselves
have
lost
sight
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
they
have
in
new
orleans.
now,
by
examination
of
the
testimony
of
judge
echezabal,
which,
i
think,
is
primarily
of
interest
to
this
court
because
it
is
the
--
he
reveals
at
the
only
place
that
is
in
the
motion
to
quash,
he
reveals
for
the
only
time
in
the
case
his
criteria
and
now
reopens
his
mind
to
us
for
the
only
time
in
this
case
and
says
that
he
did
not
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
were
negroes
on
his
--his
panel
of
75.
he
says,
"as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
been
sitting
for
33
years
and
i
don't
know
until
this
day
that
there
has
ever
been
a
negro
that's
ever
been
on
my
panel,"
and
he
explains
why.
now,
we
must
believe
the
honorable
judge
echezabal
and
i
do
believe
him
when
he
says
that
he
did
not
take
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
negroes
were
in
fact
on
his
panels
for
33
years.
but
if
i
do
that,
then
i
must
also
conclude
that
judge
echezabal
has
never
considered
negroes
for
service
on
the
grand
jury.
and
if
he
has
never
considered
negroes
and
has
only
considered
his
friends
or
persons
of
great
reputation
in
the
community,
then
he
has
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
violated
the
most
astuteness
decisions
of
--
of
this
honorable
court.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
here
too
that
there
is
a
strange
irreconcilable
conflict
between
what
judge
echezabal
says
he
did
in
the
selection
of
his
grand
jury
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
says
judge
echezabal
did.
judge
echezabal,
according
to
his
testimony,
says,
“i
look
for
no
negroes,
i
look
for
no
one
in
particular
except
my
friends.
and
if
i
couldn't
find
12
friends,
i
look
to
find
persons
of
great
reputation
who
would
make
up
the
panel
of
12.”
and
this
is
the
confession
of
judge
echezabal.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
discretion
is
broad,
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
would
say
so
because,
of
course,
we
have
in
any
absolute
criterion
to
look
into
the
minds
of
the
courts
to
find
out
just
how
far
they
can
go
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
in
deciding.
there's
no
--
no
bounds
as
established
by
our
state
courts
--
our
state
laws
rather.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
yes,
sir
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
because
no
matter
how
wide
the
discretion
may
be,
it
still
must
fit
within
the
bonds
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
--
and
your
honors
have
so
held.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
you
had
some
cases
from
new
orleans
as
late
as
two
or
three
years
ago
of
the
poret,
michel
and
labat
cases.
of
course,
it
--
it
fell
on
a
different
--
on
a
different
issue.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
pardon,
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
you
--
you
passed
on
a
particular
statute,
statute
202
of
--
of
our
law
which
in
--
in
significance
was
a
limitation
of
the
time
limit
in
which
counsel
can
urge
such
a
--
such
a
--
a
defect.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
we're
right
squarely
in
the
middle
of
this
case,
your
honor.
we
--
we
did
file
timely
and
we
do
not
have
the
question
of
--
of
state
statutory
law
prevailing
by
failure
to
exercise
our
rights
or
latches
or
for
any
other
reason
within
the
--
within
the
period
that
the
grand
jury
or
three
days
after
the
grand
jury
has
served
its
term.
that
was
the
question
in
those
cases.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
sir,
not
--
not
squarely
the
same
facts
as
our
case.
you
have
a
different
situation
in
the
country
parishes
or
the
country
counties
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
judge
does
select
to
form
another
grand
jury.
the
jury
commission
selects
20
members
of
the
grand
jury
but
--
and
you
did
pass
on
--
on
pierre
versus
the
state
of
louisiana
some
many
years
ago,
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.
but
again,
it's
not
squarely
concerning
the
wide
discretion
of
our
judges.
but
you
have
said
time
and
time
again
that
wide
discretion
will
not
permit
jury
commissioners
to
go
beyond
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
will
not
allow
them.
however,
wide
the
discretion,
i
believe,
that
was
said
in
the
norris
versus
alabama
case.
however,
high
the
standards
are
or
how
wide
the
discretion
may
be,
still,
the
selection
of
grand
juries
must
be
within
the
bounds
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
witnesses
that
i
called
were
all
judges
of
the
criminal
district
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
none
of
the
states
attorney's
office,
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
we
tried
the
case
contradictorily
with
the
district
attorney
of
the
parish
of
orleans
and
we
called
all
of
the
district
attorneys
and
all
of
the
judges
and
clerks
and
court
attachés
and
jury
commissioners.
we
called
mr.
(inaudible)
who
was
the
clerk
and
ex-officio
jury
commissioner
of
the
federal
system
to
show
that
there
are
negroes
serving
at
all
times
from
the
same
group
of
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
disallowed
that
to
which
i
took
a
bill.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
correct,
sir.
but
the
reason
that
the
court
found
that
that
was
proper
to
--
that
the
lower
court
properly
overruled
me
was
as
the
result
of
their
authority
in
the
green
case.
but
the
green
case
is
a
different
situation
entirely
because
there,
it
was
shown
that
there
were
--
there
was
a
change,
an
absolute
change
in
the
system
that
the
--
that
the
court's
mended
their
ways,
the
jury
commissioners
mended
their
ways
after
--
after
reading
cassell
versus
texas.
and
they
began
to
select
negroes
and
there
were
three,
in
fact,
on
the
grand
jury
at
that
time.
so
therefore,
that
was
--
that
was
not
true
authority
but
there's
nothing
to
differentiate
the
grand
jury
that
was
selected
by
--
by
judge
echezabal
and
this
case
from
the
long
succession
of
grand
juries
and
the
parish
of
orleans
from
whose
rosters
negroes
have
been
conspicuously
and
continuously
excluded
for
all
times.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
there
were
--
at
the
time
of
this
indictment,
there
were
six
district
courts,
six
judges,
they
are
now
eight
judges.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
they
rotate.
that's
correct,
sir,
so
that
at
that
time
they
were
serving
--
they
were
selecting
one
grand
jury
every
three
years,
two
every
--
every
year
were
selected
by
the
six
judges.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
sir.
i'm
--i'm
confining
my
argument
to
your
honors
on
the
question
of
the
constitutional
exclusion
of
negroes
in
the
grand
jury.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
in
raising
the
question?
let
me
see
if
i
understand,
your
honor.
you
refer
to
page
40
of
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
i
most
assuredly
pointed
out
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
first
paragraph
of
that
amendment,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
oh,
i
--
i
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
i
argue
that
orally
to
the
court.
in
--
in
other
words,
you
are
asking
me,
i
believe,
if
i
understand
correctly,
whether
i
prepared
before
the
court
some
error
that
pertained
to
a
specific
section
of
united
states
constitution.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
think
not,
sir.
in
--
in
oral
--
in
oral
argument,
however,
i
pointed
out
all
of
these
facts
to
the
court.
i
--
in
all
fairness,
the
background
was
simply
this,
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
in
my
estimation
and
i
simply
had
to
build
up
my
record.
and
i
knew
your
honors
would
recognize
immediately
what
section
of
the
constitution
it
was
that
i
was
aiming
at.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
the
only
thing
that
the
state
says
in
this
case
is
that
judge
echezabal
and
all
other
fine
judges
in
orleans
parish
have
not
discriminated
because
they
say
they
have
not
discriminated.
they
also
say
that
the
jury
commissioners
have
not
discriminated
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
four
in
fact.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
sir,
that's
correct.
and
they
do
say
this,
which
is
very
interesting
to
me
because
of
the
cassell
case,
they
say
that
we
--
to
strike
down
the
grand
jury
that
was
selected
by
judge
echezabal
would
be
in
a
sense
to
apply
evil
intent
to
our
judge
echezabal
and
of
course,
we
don't
mean
that
at
all
because
as
your
honors
have
so
well
and
often
pointed
out,
it
is
not
a
question
of
evil
intent,
it's
simply
a
question
of,
perhaps,
a
misconception
of
what
the
duty
requires
of
a
judge.
and
i
think
your
honors
have
said
that
in
the
cassell
case.
and
we,
of
course,
do
not
believe
that
judge
echezabal
has
any
evil
intent.
we
believe
that
he
simply
has
neglected
to
reconsider,
because
he's
a
very
learned
gentleman,
reconsidered
in
the
last
33
years
just
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
means
and
has
violated
it
unconsciously
and
without
evil
intent
meaningfully
only
in
the
fact
that
he
selected
his
friends
and
selected
other
persons
of
great
prominence
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
am
not
certain
that
i
did
that.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
think
i
brought
all
of
the
cases
up
--
unto
the
reese
case.
i
think
that
i
may
or
may
not
have
brought
the
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
court
itself
referred
to
the
reese
case
but
i
don't
think
it
helped
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
correct.
in
addition,
hill
versus
texas
and
patton
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
all
of
those
i
have
my
--
my
supreme
court
brief
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
i'm
just
reading
the
index,
smith
versus
texas,
state
versus
pierre.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
brief
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
--
no,
sir,
the
only
--
the
--
the
brief
--
no,
the
brief
of
the
state
court
is
not
before
your
honor
but
i'd
be
very
happy
to
leave
one.
i
have
only
one
copy
and
i'd
be
very
happy
to
do
that
if
you
--
if
--
but
the
point
that
i
was
making
previously
was
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
while
judge
echezabal
says
that
he
makes
no
--
takes
no
cognizance
of
whether
there
was
in
fact
negroes
or
none
on
the
grand
jury
panel,
the
supreme
court
rather
cavalierly
has
dismissed
my
very
serious
constitutional
question
by
saying
that
the
reason
that
there
were
no
negroes
on
this
particular
jury
was
because
the
white
persons
thereon
were
better
qualified.
now,
better
means
or
envisions
a
comparison.
someone
is
better
than
someone
else
by
comparison
and
there
was
no
comparison
by
virtue
of
the
testimony
of
judge
echezabal
himself
who
says,
"i
made
no
comparison.
i
didn't
even
know
they
were
there.for
33
years,
i
haven't
made
any
effort
to
find
out
whether
negroes
were
there
or
not
and
i
do
not
compare."
and
he
does
not
have
to
compare
because,
of
course,
as
a
distinguished
judge,
he
know
so
many
qualified
persons
who
would
be
part
of
that
particular
grand
jury.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
if
you
think
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
of
course,
they
--
there's
no
confession
of
it
except
by
judge
o'hara's
confession.
he
is
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
oh,
quite
right,
sir,
because
this
is
--
as
much
discrimination
by
jurists
who
no
know
negroes
as
those
who
know
and
do
not
select
them.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i'm
sure
you
have,
sir.
it's
a
quotation
from
your
honor.
but
be
that
as
it
--
as
it
may,
the
--
the
court
in
this
particular
case
makes
it
impossible
under
theory
that
--
that
is
whether
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
is
correct
when
it
says
there
was
such
a
comparison
or
whether
we
believe
judge
echezabal
who
can't
believe
both
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
whether
we
believe
one
or
the
other
it
makes
no
difference
because
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
is
correct,
then
we
have
a
very
dangerous
president
which
our
state
is
--
is
about
to
start
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
that
is
by
placing
such
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
judge.
at
best,
we
have
a
situation
where
69
or
70
white
men
are
--
are
placed
in
a
contest
with
only
six
or
seven
negroes,
grand
jury
in
and
grand
jury
out.
and
you
are
not
only
discriminating
against
the
negro
if
you
are
causing
such
a
system
to
prevail
where
those
six
must
compete
in
the
contest
with
those
69.
but
i
say
that
you
are
ensuring
racial
discrimination
in
the
state
of
--
in
the
parish
of
orleans,
you
are
ensuring
it
by
that
very
technique.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
there
are
12
always.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
always
12.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
sir,
its
nine
or
12.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
so
therefore,
whatever
system
has
been
employed
and
i
say
that
no
matter
who
has
sat
on
the
--
on
the
bench
or
what
era
it
was
or
whether
it
was
judge
o'hara,
whether
it
was
judge
echezabal
or
whether
--
whoever
the
district
attorney
may
have
been,
it
made
no
difference.
the
effect
in
the
result
in
the
parish
of
orleans
has
been
constant
and
continuous
for
the
many
years
in
the
history
of
--
of
our
parish.
and
it
does
not
make
any
difference
obviously
because
the
method
that
the
court
imposes
upon
itself
by
placing
at
best
within
its
power
the
weapon
to
choose
a
better
man
against
another
man,
you're
--
you're
giving,
to
the
court,
a
discretion
which
i
think
must
be
stricken
down
if
we
ought
to
apply
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
it's
true
sense.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
think
that
perhaps
we
--
we
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
i
have
reserved
some
time
up
to
now,
have
i
not?
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
fine.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
it
is
so
seldom
that
anyone
has
the
opportunity
of
correcting
statements
of
the
eminent
assistant
attorney
general
that
it
is
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
that
i
am
a
position
now
and
certainly
i
will
not
take
advantage
of
the
fact
but
it
is
a
--
an
unusually
unique
experience
to
be
able
to
be
here
and
to
correct
the
statement
by
someone
so
capable
and
competent
in
our
state
as
the
assistant
attorney
general,
mr.
culligan.
but
it
necessarily
because
of
my
representation
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
point
out
the
fact
that
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
outside
of
the
parish
of
orleans,
grand
--
negro
grand
jurors
are
serving
everyday.
it
is
only
in
the
parish
of
orleans
to
my
knowledge
and
to
the
knowledge
of
this
record
that
negroes
are
not
serving
and
that
is
not
a
mystery.
it
is
because
the
judges
in
the
parish
of
orleans
have
been
by
system,
by
method,
by
design,
by
device
or
scheme
excluding
negroes
from
service
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
of
course,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
it
must
be
consciously
carried
out.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
it
must
be
consciously
carried
out.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
design
is
to
select
those
persons
by
traditional
new
orleans
standards
who
are
men
of
great
prominence
and
who
are
well
acquainted
to
the
courts
themselves,
to
the
judges
themselves.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
and
or
white.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
and
or
white.
they
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
--
that's
true
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
true
of
our
jury
system
in
orleans
parish.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
taken
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
is
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
testimony
of
the
judges
themselves
point
out
that
they
do
not
even
consider
negroes.
and
the
reason
that
they
do
not
consider
negroes
is
because
they
are
under
the
mistaken
belief
that
simply
by
choosing
the
elite,
that
they
do
not
have
to
consider
those
who
are
not
elite
and
judge
echezabal
testifies
that
for
33
years,
he
has
not
changed
his
system
of
jury
selection,
but
has
always
looked
at
his
list
of
75
found
that
the
--
that
the
facts
contained
on
that
list
was
sufficient
to
tell
him
who
--
who
were
the
--
who
were
the
presidents
of
the
banks
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
who
were
the
vice
presidents
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
he
knew
them
by
name.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
they
give
an
occupation
and
they
give
the
location
of
their
business
address
and
they
give
the
name
of
their
business,
and
they
give
the
past
history
of
grand
and
petit
jury
service.
and
this,
according
to
the
very
testimony
of
the
judge
echezabal
was
sufficient.
but
judge
echezabal
goes
one
step
further
and
he
says,
“in
my
77
years
on
the
bench,
i
know
most
of
the
people
that
are
on
the
--
the
panels
of
75,
time
and
time
again.
and
i
know
10
or
12
of
these.
i
don't
have
to
go
beyond
that.”
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
he
grew
up
with
the
city,
yes
sir.
[laughter]
and
this
is
his
testimony
and
may
i
point
out
to
your
honors
that
we
have
two
avenues
of
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
grand
jury
system
in
orleans
parish.
not
only
are
we
relying
upon
the
past
history
which
has
been
complete,
constant,
continuous
exclusion
of
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
but
we
are
also
pointing
out
the
fact
that
even
if
all
of
the
other
five
judges
were
perfectly
constitutional
in
their
--
their
evasion
of
a
--
of
a
system
of
selection,
that
judge
echezabal
himself
and
we've
primarily
considered
--
primarily
interest
in
judge
echezabal
because
it's
his
grand
jury
that
has
brought
in
the
indictment
herein.
judge
echezabal
himself
has
pointed
out
his
own
failure
to
abide
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
just
in
the
parish
of
orleans
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
and
only
for
criminal
jurisdiction.
and
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
strange
to
your
honors
that
in
the
last
50
years
that
from
the
parish
of
orleans,
year
after
year,
grand
jury
after
grand
jury
and
that
would
be
two
a
year,
there
were
100
grand
juries
in
the
federal
court
systems
selecting
systems,
selecting
persons
from
orleans
parish
to
sit
on
the
grand
jury
and
there
were
at
least
two
every
year
in
the
federal
grand
jury
system
and
none
in
orleans
parish?
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
o'brien
at
page
81
of
your
honor's
record
is
“i
would
say
i
don't
recall
a
negro
ever
being
on
the
grand
jury
who
was
a
resident
of
another
parish
other
than
orleans.”
so,
the
reason
i
point
that
out
is
because
while
the
--
while
it's
true
that
the
federal
system
calls
upon
four
distinct
parishes
including
orleans,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
because
of
the
large
size
and
convenience
of
orleans
parish
residents
being
near
the
orleans
parish
courthouse,
so
that
is
the
federal
district
courthouse.
invariably,
the
selection
is
from
orleans
parish
residents.
so,
therefore,
we
have
on
one
side
for
50
years,
two
jurors
selected
from
orleans
parish
every
year
to
serve
on
the
federal
grand
jury
system
and
none
for
the
last
50
years
serving
in
orleans
parish.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
of
pittance,
a
very
small
pittance.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
state
pays
them
nothing.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
think
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
three
or
four
dollars
per
day.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i'm
--
i
think
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
he
would,
yes
sir.
however,
there
is
no
testimony,
whatsoever,
in
this
record,
not
a
bit,
to
show
that
anyone
of
the
many
negroes
that
have
been
on
our
panels
for
the
last
30,
40,
or
50
years,
not
one
has
asked
to
be
excluded
because
they
could
not
survive
by
serving
for
six
months
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
point
at
all.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
think
it
is
the
burden
of
the
defendant
and
petitioner
to
show
that
there
has
been
systematic
exclusion
on
--
by
the
same
rule
that
has
been
established
by
this
court
in
patton
versus
mississippi
to
show
that
there
are
large
numbers
of
negroes,
available
and
qualified
to
serve
and
that
they
have
not
served
over
time
immemorial.
and
after
establishing
that,
we
have
established
the
prima
facie
of
case
and
it
is
then
the
burden
of
the
state
to
show
that
the
reason
why
there
are
no
negro
serving
or
no
negroes
called
by
the
judges
or
selected
by
them
is
because
they
would
starve
to
death
if
they
were
to
serve.
and
the
state
has
failed
to
establish
any
of
that
evidence
and
has
failed
to
meet
the
burden
of
proof.
there
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
if
your
honors
believe
that
the
expression
in
our
statute,
judges
of
the
several
district
courts
shall
have
the
right
to
decide
upon
the
competency
of
jurors
as
granting
to
them
wide
discretion,
i
must
agree
with
you.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
spoke
of
that
yesterday
when
you
asked
me
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
the
question
to
--
to
supply
you
the
reference
of
our
statute
and
we
talked
about
this
being
a
very
particularized
situation.
however,
i
asked
you
at
that
time
if
you
would
please
read
that
with
the
other
statute
if
you
will
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
we
must
be
fair
and
we
must
recognize
that
there
there's
besides
section
172
of
our
title
15,
also
section
192.
i
don't
--
i
--
i
don't
feel
i'm
risking
anything
by
being
fair
because
i
think
by
--
by
--
looking
at
190
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
pardon
sir?
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no.
[laughter]
i
--
i
trust
that
your
honors
will
--
will
acknowledge
the
fact
that
i
--
i
would
only
represent
the
--
the
fairness
of
the
situation.
but
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes
sir,
thank
you.
[laughter].
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
i'm
saying
--
i'm
saying
this
that
if
i
were
to
argue
to
your
honors
that
mr.
culligan
has
been
wrong
all
of
this
time
that
we
must
consider
that
the
competency
or
the
discretion
as
to
selecting
full
competency
is
limited
to
article
172.
i
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
say
but
what
about
192?
do
not
the
judges
of
orleans
parish
have
the
final
say
with
regard
to
competency?
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
i
must
embrace
that
argument
as
being
--
being
a
--
a
very
good
one
for
our
position.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
making
it,
i'm
--
i'm
embracing
it
now,
of
course,
because
your
honor
considers
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
significant
one.
[laughter]
but
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
again,
i'm
shame-faced
in
saying
that
our
supreme
court
i
think
has
--
has
lost
a
complete
concept
of
--
of
what
is
the
law
in
this
field.
i
--
i
certainly
do
not
want
to
give
the
impression
that
i
am
leaning
over
backwards
to
offend
my
supreme
court
which
is
not
the
case
at
all.
but
i
must
say
that
when
i
read
the
opinion
of
justice
(inaudible)
of
our
supreme
court,
the
very
same
justice
who
spoke
of
--
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
being
a
judicial
planet
in
whose
orbit
the
decisions
of
the
state
courts
are
drawn
through
it's
vortex
and
that
sort
of
language,
in
order
--
as
he
says
to
maintain
the
law
and
--
and
the
majesty
of
final
decision.
when
i
read
that
decision
and
then
read
his
decision
in
the
eubanks
case
in
which
he
says,
“there's
been
no
discrimination
in
orleans
parish
because
judge
echezabal
selected
the
white
men
who
are
better
qualified
than
the
negroes
then
i
am
saying
that
i
must
attack
the
supreme
court
as
having
lost
sight
of
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no
sir.
there
has
not
--
there
has
not
been.
it
is
true
that
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
has
been
cognizant
in
the
past
of
the
interpretation
in
this
field
that
your
honors
have
placed
upon
this
body
of
law.
but
it
is
equally
true
that
they
have
completely
gone
astray
in
the
--
in
this
instance
by
not
interpreting
it
at
all.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
according
to
its
opinion
was
satisfied
that
the
state
simply
rebutted
our
case
by
saying
--
by
pointing
out
the
testimony
of
judge
(inaudible)
who
made
an
assertion
that
he
has
never
discriminated
against
negroes.
and
they
were
satisfied
with
that
without
going
beyond
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
my
attitude
is
simply
this
mr.
justice
black,
there
is
a
constitutional
inhibition.
we
--
we
all
recognize
that
it's
an
inhibition
and
yet
at
the
same
time,
there
--
there
has
been
a
--
a
disobedience,
if
you
will,
to
that
inhibition
on
the
grounds
that
we
have
wide
discretion.
we
are
the
judges
of
the
orleans
parish
court
and
our
statute
says
that
we
may
decide
on
the
competency
of
jurors
and
we
need
not
consider
that
we
are
inhibited
by
the
united
states
constitution.
and
that's
why
i
say
and
say
seriously
that
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
now,
how
could
i
--
i
say
that
in
--
in
advancing
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
of
mr.
justice
black
and
say
it
meaningfully?
obviously,
i
must
say
that
if
the
judges
go
astray
as
the
jury
commissioners
in
the
past
have
gone
astray,
they
must
be
stricken
down
just
as
quickly
and
--
and
just
as
deliberately
by
the
majesty
of
--
of
the
united
states
supreme
law
as
--
as
though
they
were
one
and
the
same.
and
it
is
not
necessarily
true,
may
it
please
your
honor
that
it
--
these
cases
that
have
come
before
you
have
always
been
as
a
result
of
discrimination
by
the
jury
commissioners.
there
are
instances
such
as
in
texas
where
at
least
the
judges
select
12
out
of
the
16.
so
although
they
limit
--
although
they're
limited
to
16
to
begin
with
and
not
75,
there
is
still
judicial
discretion
that
has
been
abused
and
your
honors
have
deliberately
and
forcefully
stricken
them
down.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
--
i
don't
--
if
this
paragraph
is
read
with
the
entire
opinion
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
oh,
i
see.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
the
paragraph
in
my
opinion
means
that
judge
o'hara,
one
of
the
six
judges
of
whom
we're
speaking,
is
a
self-confessed
sinner.
and
as
a
sinner,
he
has
now
come
to
the
realization
that
he
and
his
colleagues
in
the
orleans
parish
bench
have
not
recognized
the
united
states
constitution,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
thereof.
and
that
he
has
now
for
the
very
first
time,
realized
his
duty
to
consider
negroes
for
selection
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
and
the
reason
for
that
and
he
goes
in
more
detail
at
another
time.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
we
--
we
must
talk
about
what
he
means
by
qualified
for
me
to
answer
that
correctly,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
it
means
qualified
but
in
certain
significance
that
only
judge
o'hara
has
--
has
shown
because
judge
o'hara
found
three
competent
negroes
on
his
previous
grand
jury
in
1952.
mr.
culligan
referred
to
that
instance.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
he
did
throw
them
off.
he
threw
them
off
because
his
explanation
was
that
we
were
in
the
throes
at
that
time
of
a
police
investigation.
the
police
system
was
under
attack
for
the
first
time
in
--
in
many,
many
years
in
orleans
parish
and
he
felt
that
it
would
be
an
inopportune
time
to
select
these
three
most
qualified
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
and
he
did
not.
he
purposely
excluded
them.
he
--
he
tried
to
justify
it
by
saying
it
was
for
their
own
protection
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
but
he
--
but
he
found
--
he
did,
of
course.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
he
gave
reasons
for
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
--
the
first
time.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
that's
correct,
sir.
is
that
--
not
a
confession
of
the
court
and
i
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
no,
sir.
i
--
i
mean
that
that
--
that
is
--
is
--
it
is
revealing
for
the
first
time
that
the
judges
of
the
orleans
parish
court
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
well,
i
think
that
--
of
course,
i'm
not
here
to
defend
that
mind,
sir,
and
--
and
i
speak
seriously
with
you
but
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
by
just
a
reading
of
the
testimony
of
the
judges
themselves,
your
honor
would
show
that
--
that
they
themselves
have
not
considered
negroes.
when
they
send
letters
out,
they
have
75
names.
when
they
send
letters
out
to
20,
invariably,
those
20
are
white.
when
--
another
judge
will
send
letters
out
to
35,
invariably,
they
will
be
white.
now,
since
this
question
was
raised
in
eubanks
versus
the
state
of
louisiana,
it
is
quite
a
fact
that
while
50
years
before,
there
have
been
no
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
that
since
the
eubanks
case,
there
have
been
six.
judge
o'hara
has
broken
the
unbroken
record
up
to
that
time
by
selecting
two
after
the
eubanks
case,
judge
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
after
the
eubanks
trial
and
as
late
as
the
case
having
gone
to
the
supreme
court
or
in
between
the
--
the
case
going
from
the
--
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
i
--
i
must
say
that
it
--
it
is
the
practice
although
all
of
the
judges
don't
practice
it
in
our
parish.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
if
your
honor
would
sanction
it
otherwise
why
we
would
probably
revert
to
a
system
where
we
had
no
negroes
for
some
50
years.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
that's
right.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
herbert
j.
garon
thank
you
very
much.
