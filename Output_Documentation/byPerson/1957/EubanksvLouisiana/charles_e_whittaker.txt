you
said
endowed
with
the
right.
do
you
really
mean
that
or
isn't
that
the
case
that
as
a
practical
matter,
out
of
this
large
number
from
whom
--
from
which
the
judge
may
make
the
selection
and
takes
the
people
he
knows,
you
assume
(inaudible)
that,
isn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
did
not
stop.
justice
charles

whittaker
all
would
be
a
better
word.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
on
the
panel
might
be
a
better
word
--
justice
charles

whittaker
--
to
sit
on
jury.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles

the

whittaker
mr.
--
mr.
culligan.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
have
if
i'm
asked.
i've
had
some
experience
with
this
kind
of
attrition
rate
that
called
for
jurors
in
jurisdictions
where
they're
reasonably
paid
mileage.
i
know
that
if
you
have
some
problem
in
getting
even
public
jurors
who
will
serve
for
a
two
week
period
and
i've
had
greater
difficultly
in
getting
grand
jurors
who
were
to
serve
from
nine
year
--
or
nine
month
period
or
a
year.
and
in
your
jurisdiction
i
understand
that
they
are
not
paid.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
after
the
75
are
drawn
from
the
field,
out
of
which
the
12
who
will
constitute
the
grand
jury
are
selected.
when
is
the
--
the
juror
drawn
advised
of
the
fact
that
he
has
been
gone
and
thereby
giving
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
make
his
hard
enough
plea
to
the
judge
for
excuse?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
clear
up
now
you
gentlemen.
is
there
--
why
they
would
not
wish
to
serve
on
a
grand
jury?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
does
--
or
do
they
know
that
the
grand
jury
service
under
your
system
will
be
at
least
six
months?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
culligan.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
might
i
ask
you
one
last
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
know
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
or
do
you
know
from
your
experience
why
they're
going
to
that
--
people
who
are
selected
on
this
panel
of
potential
grand
jury
and
are
thus
to
serve
its
actually
sworn
and
accepted
for
at
least
six
months
come
in
to
the
judges
and
say,
“judge,
i
cannot
do
this,
because
i'll
leave
my
job”.
and
then
the
employers
intervene
and
say
to
the
judge,
“this
is
the
man
we
can't
spare
for
that
length
of
time.”
you
know
if
that
happens
if
you're
not
down
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
talking
more
about
the
employees,
as
well.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i've
had
them,
too
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
the
discretion
to
some
extent
is
not
there
and
to
be
exercised.
then
answer
me
why
draw
more
than
12?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
say
if
the
judge
is
not
to
exercise
a
discretion
in
the
selection
of
the
12
out
of
the
75,
why
draw
more
than
12?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
that
you
mentioned
that
the
federal
government
pays
jurors
to
date,
per
diem
and
mileage?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
state
pays
them
nothing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
you
say
a
pittance,
do
you
not
get
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
each
way?
and
then
you
do
not
get
the
per
diem
in
addition?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
federal
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
believe
it's
more.
but,
one
who
would
possibly
live
over
the
period
of
six
months
and
served
on
the
grand
jury
and
the
federal
court
whereas
in
the
state
court,
he
would
have
starved
to
death
wouldn't
he?
