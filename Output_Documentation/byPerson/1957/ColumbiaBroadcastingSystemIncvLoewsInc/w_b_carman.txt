mr.
w.
b.
carman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
which
tests
the
right
of
the
copyright
in
order
to
limit,
control
or
prohibit
some
other
author
in
the
creation
of
a
parody
or
burlesque
and
in
that
--
to
that
extend
it
test
the
legitimacy
of
the
arts
of
parody
and
burlesque.
before
i
state
the
facts,
i'd
like
to
get
a
little
terminology
out
of
the
way.
there
will
be
no
distinction
made
there
in
my
talk
between
the
voice
of
parody
or
burlesque.
the
nature
of
the
parody
or
burlesque,
there
may
be
some
distinctions
that
i
shan't
make
them.
the
nature
of
parody
or
burlesque,
i
may
say
it's
pretty
easier
to
recognize,
one
that
it
is
to
define
one,
but
the
art
consists
generally
in
picking
on
some
original,
and
in
this
discussion
the
original
will
be
limited
to
a
particular
work
of
a
particular
author
and
then
by
use
of
exaggeration,
distortion,
all
of
the
comic
arts,
all
of
the
arts
of
humor,
turning
that
original,
metamorphosing
as
it
might
be
the
original
and
it's
something
comic
and
unusual.
the
peculiar
and
unique
effect
with
parody
is
really
created
by
its
audience
and
to
a
certain
extent,
where
the
writer
presents
sufficient
similarities
to
the
original
in
his
work,
so
that
the
both
similarities
call
back
to
the
audience,
their
remembrance
of
what
they
first
saw,
and
then
they
contrast
that,
in
their
minds
with
the
funny
things
which
the
new
author
has
done
with
it
and
that
produces
that
rare
unique
result
of
a
parody.
its
peculiar
humor
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
audience
recognizes
the
object
of
a
parody,
and
if
doesn't
recognize
the
object,
then
it
fails.
so
obviously
the
parodist
needs
to
use
a
good
deal
of
the
original
copyrighted
work,
because
he
has
to
point
up
the
similarities
between
that
work
and
his
work,
as
well
he
does
the
differences.
now
i
come
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
that's
correct.
he
stimulates
the
memory
of
the
audience
of
the
original
if
i
may
say
it,
justice
frankfurter.
in
1944
loew's
incorporated
produced
a
very
fine
motion
picture
called
‘gaslight'
which
was
copyrighted.
it
was
based
on
a
play
by
mr.
hamilton,
but
the
play
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
only
the
motion
picture
copyright
and
there
is
a
synopsis
of
this
melodrama
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
it
was
an
expensive
play,
a
very
successful
play;
it
played
to
about
altogether
around
15
million
people.
in
1946,
it
was
withdrawn
from
domestic
exhibition,
but
it
continued
to
be
used
abroad.
mr.
benny
as
we
probably
all
know
was
a
very
successful
comedian
and
actor
in
the
motion
pictures,
satires,
stage,
screen,
radio
and
television
and
he
had
accustomed
in
his
radio
programs,
so
that
from
time
to
time,
the
parody
or
burlesque
of
various
motion
pictures,
and
when
he
came
into
television
in
1952,
he
put
on
a
television
parody
or
burlesque
of
this
picture
‘gaslight,'
this
loew's
motion
picture
‘gaslight',
and
it
was
about
15
minutes
skit
on
his
television
program
in
which
he
--
it
was
stated
to
be
a
satire
on
gaslight
and
he
took
a
few
of
the
incidents
in
the
general
storyline.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
he
said
it
was
a
satire
on
the
production
of
‘gaslight,'
the
words
that
i
think
he
used
and
there's
a
synopsis
to
that
also
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
to
the
extent
that
anybody
can
synopsize
a
parody
or
burlesque.
loew's
objected
to
that
action
on
the
ground
that
it
wasn't
infringement
of
copyright.
the
broadcasters
claimed
that
it
was
fairly
used
and
nothing
was
done
about
that
particular
program.
that
happened
to
have
been
what
we
call
a
live
broadcast;
it
was
a
broadcast
direct
from
the
stage
over
the
air.
now
subsequently
it
became
the
custom
to
a
photograph
he
had
broadcast
and
put
then
on
the
film.
and
when
i
met
mr.
benny
in
1953,
was
preparing
his
next
season's
series
of
five
programs,
he
decided
to
repeat
or
remake
this
broadcast,
this
parody
of
‘gaslight'.
loew's
found
out
that
he
was
about
to
do
that
through
the
newspaper
publicity
and
they
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
the
production
of
the
program.
that
temporary
restraining
order
was
amended
by
stipulation
to
permit
the
photographing
of
the
program
on
film;
the
case
was
then
tried
on
stipulated
facts.
there
was
only
one
witness,
a
dr.
baxter
of
the
university
of
southern
california
who
talked
about
the
literary
rights;
and
the
court
held
that
there
wasn't
infringement.
the
court
first
stated
in
its
opinion
and
this
was
just
to
judge
carter,
that
the
owner
of
a
copyright
was
entitled
to
be
protected
against
the
taking
of
our
substantial
portion
of
its
protectable
material
when
that
the
copying
of
a
substantial
part
constitutes
an
infringement.
that's
the
general
rule;
it
took
from
what
we
call
a
plagiarism
case.
it
found
then
upon
examination
of
the
works,
that
there
was
a
substantial
taking
by
defendant
from
the
plaintiff's
copyrighted
property,
and
it
declared
that
under
these
circumstances
if
this
were
the
ordinary
plagiarism
case,
without
the
defense
of
burlesque
as
a
fair
us,
it
would
clear
under
the
authorities
that
there
had
been
access,
a
substantial
taking,
and
therefore,
infringement.
now,
we
concede
that
if
this
were
an
ordinary
plagiarism
case
with
two
similar
works
involved
that
the
taking
of
amount
which
we
use
for
the
parody,
could
properly
be
held
to
be
a
substantial
taking
from
the
original
work.
the
court,
trial
court
then
went
on
and
cited
and
discussed
a
number
of
the
cases
involving
fair
use,
but
it
categorized
its
pretence,
the
proposition
that
burlesques
as
a
fair
use
justifies
a
substantial
taking
and
it
concluded
and
i
quote,
“parody
or
burlesque
taking
is
to
be
treated
no
differently
from
any
other
appropriation,
that
as
in
all
other
cases
of
burlesques
taking
the
issue
becomes
first,
one
of
the
fact
that
is,
what
was
taken,
and
how
substantial
was
the
taking,
and
if
it
is
determined
that
there
was
a
substantial
taking,
infringement
exists.
the
court
made
then
formal
finding
that
the
television
program
copied
a
substantial
part
--
was
copied
in
substantial
part
from
the
moving
picture
and
that
such
part
was
a
substantial
part
of
the
program.
if
the
use
wasn't
fair,
and
are
made
fair
by
the
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
use
was
for
parody
or
burlesque.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
you
have
to
look
at
the
film
your
honor
and
we
concede
there
was
a
taking
which
would
have
been
substantial
under
the
rule,
under
the
plagiarism
rule,
we
concede
that.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
we
may
say
definitely,
it
is
not
enough
your
honor,
definitely
it
is
not
enough.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
no
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
the
dividing
line
is
this
and
now
--
i
hope
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
what
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
w.
b.
carman
i'll
definitely
come
to
that.
injunction
was
made
permanent
in
this
case.
no
damage
has
been
asked
by
loew's
since
it
was
a
test
case
and
no
damage
was
awarded.
now
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
substantially
on
judge
carter's
opinion.
it
accepted
the
finding
that
there
was
a
copy
of
a
substantial
part.
it
found
that
was
supported
by
the
evidence,
and
as
i
say
we
concede
that.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
yes.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
oh
no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
very
bitterly
contested
case,
what
mr.
selvin
described
it
below
as
being
a
case
brought
on
principle,
and
i
think
it
is
a
case
brought
on
principle.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
yes,
it
certainly
can.
the
court
in
the
court
of
appeal
looked
down
the
fair
use
doctrine
as
being
generally
limited
to
the
when
“compilation
(inaudible)
things
digest
and
the
like
and
it
then
adapted
judge
carter's
rule
that
you
test
a
parody
and
burlesque
just
the
same
as
you
do
any
other
taking,
and
that
the
issue
is
what
is
taken.
how
substantially
was
the
taking,
and
if
it
was
substantial,
then
infringement
exists.
now
therefore,
the
lower
courts
held
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
a
parody
and
burlesque
was
legitimate
only,
if
the
amount
of
the
copyright
of
the
original
which
was
used
in
its
creation,
is
not
substantial.
we
thought
that
was
an
erroneous,
considered
as
an
erroneous
ruling,
we
asked
for
certiorari
and
it
was
granted.
now
at
the
outset,
this
case
depends
upon
the
rule
over
your
honor,
which
we
think
is
applicable
here
of
fair
use.
in
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
want
to
develop
and
it
takes
me
a
few
minutes
to
develop
the
limitations
of
this
rule,
which
is
the
fair
used
doctrine.
we
start
with
this
proposition
that
the
copyright
act
itself
is
broad
in
its
language.
for
our
purposes
it
provides
that
the
copyright
owner
has
the
exclusive
right
to
print
copy
or
sell
his
copyrighted
work,
to
translate
it
or
make
any
other
versions,
to
exhibit,
perform,
represent,
produce
or
reproduce
it
any
manner
or
by
any
methods
whatsoever.
but
the
copyright
act
stems
of
course,
as
all
laws
do
from
the
constitution
and
the
constitutional
provision
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please
is
a
rather
unusual
one.
it's
article
1
section
8,
which
says,
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
useful
arts,
by
securing
for
limited
times
through
authors
and
inventors,
the
exclusive
right
to
their
respective
writings
and
discoveries.
you
will
note
that
the
constitution
specifically
provides,
in
this
case
the
purpose
of
the
copyright
law,
which
is
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
the
useful
arts.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
no
sir,
i
do
not.
i
think
that
justice
holmes
in
the
bilstein
case,
as
well
determined
that
that's
not
the
province
of
the
courts.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
now
all
of
the
rights
even
offered
after
publication
stem
from
the
copyright
law,
because
at
common
law,
once
an
author
had
written
a
work
and
published
it,
he
had
no
further
rights
therein.
that's
the
american
common
law,
has
been
declared
by
this
court
as
early
as
wheaton
against
peters
and
has
always
been
the
law
of
the
court.
on
other
words,
the
author's
right
stemmed
directly
from
the
law.
a
common
law,
once
you've
published
it,
anybody
could
use
it,
he
had
no
more
rights
therein.
now
the
makers
of
the
constitution
recognized
that
it
was
tremendously
important
to
this
country,
to
see
that
learning
and
knowledge
be
disseminated
and
that
the
arts
and
sciences
grow
and
flourish.
and
they
felt
that
they
there
was
no
real
encouragement
offered
to
produce
that
result,
because
once
he
had
utilized
his
power
to
make
a
first
publication,
he
had
no
further
rights.
so,
again,
in
order
to
promote
the
science
and
the
useful
arts
and
for
that
purpose
only,
they
decided
it
give
the
author
certain
rights.
and
the
primary
right
obviously
that
the
author
should
have,
or
at
least
they
felt
he
should
have
was
the
right
to
market
his
work
after
publication
for
a
limited
period
time
and
being
free
from
having
somebody
else
market
the
same
work,
but
may
i
point
out
that
this
reward
which
they
gave
to
the
author
under
the
constitution
was
purely
secondary
and
this
court
has
so
held,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
promote
science
and
the
useable
arts
and
only
the
rewards
of
the
author
was
secondary
to
that
purpose.
this
court
has
stated
that
principle
very
recently,
it
goes
back
to
chief
justice
hughes'
statement
in
fox
film
against
doyal
in
286
federal,
but
this
court
has
repeated
this
statement
in
the
paramount
case,
in
334
us
and
(inaudible)
against
stein,
i.e.,
that
the
primary
purposes
the
promotion
of
the
arts
and
the
author's
reward
is
purely
secondary.
now
then,
we
therefore
must
construe
the
copyright
act
in
connection
with
its
primary
purpose
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
the
useful
art.
therefore,
while
we're
not
going
to
permit,
and
we
should
not
permit
some
other
author
to
market
the
copyright
owner's
work,
we
should
not
prohibit
him
from
impeding
the
progress
of
these
arts
from
destroying
the
very
purpose
of
the
constitution
by
prohibiting
him
from
using
that
work,
and
consequently
it
is
not
the
law
and
it
never
has
been
the
law,
that
regardless
of
the
language
of
the
act,
that
a
copyright
owner
has
a
complete
monopoly
of
everything
that
appears
in
his
work.
i
can
state
it
no
better
than
as
the
late
(inaudible)
chapuis
stated
it
in
an
article
in
which
he
wrote
for
the
45
(inaudible)
law
review
as
filed.
nobody
else
should
mark
the
author's
book,
but
we
refuse
to
say
nobody
else
should
use
it.
progress
would
be
stippled
if
the
author
had
a
complete
monopoly
of
everything
in
his
book
for
56
years
or
any
longer
period.
some
of
its
contents
must
be
permitted
in
connection
with
the
independent
creation
of
the
other
authors.
the
very
policy
which
leaves
the
law
to
encourage
his
creativeness
also
justifies
it
in
facilitating
the
creativeness
of
others.
now
may
i
give
an
example,
if
it
please
the
court,
and
this
is
purely
an
example,
for
that
reason
there,
i
will
bring
things
in
a
copyrighted
work
that
are
not
covered
by
exclusive
rights
of
the
authors.
the
best
what
we
call
uncopyrighted
material,
thoughts,
concepts,
ideas,
now
these
maybe
entirely
original,
they
maybe
very
valuable,
they
may
appear
no
where
else,
except
in
the
copyrighted
work,
but
they
are
not
protected.
the
best
there
are
being
not
protected
as
so
called
uncopyrightable
property,
the
best
of
rule
has
been
stated
many
times,
but
the
best
statement
is
that
of
justice
learned
hand
i
think,
in
the
nichols
case
which
is
in
45
f.2d
119
and
the
reason
why
those
ideas,
no
matter
how
important
they
are,
how
valuable,
how
unique
are
not
protected,
is
well
stated
by
the
court
in
(inaudible)
because
it
says
that
otherwise
you
did
try
to
protect
them,
science,
poetry,
narrative
and
dramatic
fiction
and
other
branches
of
literature
would
be
hindered
by
copyright,
instead
of
being
promoted.
now
i
don't
claim.
i
want
to
make
this
clear;
we
don't
claim
that
what
we
took
here
was
uncopyrighted
property.
we
agree
that
what
we
took
here
was
copyrighted
property
and
in
the
amount,
which
the
court
might
properly
have
found
used
i
should
say,
instead
it
took,
we
used
copyrighted
property
and
in
an
amount
which
the
court
might
find
to
be
substantial,
but
i
give
this
as
an
example
your
honors
to
show
that
the
copyright
monopoly
is
not
all
embracing
and
doesn't
cover
everything
and
never
has.
and
by
the
same
reason,
and
for
the
same
reasons,
the
doctrine
of
fair
use
to
get
to
mr.
chief
justice's
question,
the
doctrine
of
fair
use
has
been
established
in
the
law
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
certain
uses
of
copyrightable
property,
because
otherwise,
for
the
same
reason,
the
progress
of
arts
and
science
in
the
primary
purpose
of
the
copyright
law
would
be
destroyed.
now
the
fair
use
doctrine
is
not
as
the
court
of
appeal
seem
to
think
sort
of
a
convenient
catchall
phrase
for
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
exceptions
to
the
law,
and
it
certainly
is
not
as
respondents
argue,
just
another
name
for
the
rule
which
says
that
a
substantial
taking
maybe
infringement.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
respondent's
argument,
it
is
that
any
taking
which
is
substantial
is
an
infringement
and
the
fair
use
rule
that
simply
means
that
an
insubstantial
taking
is
not
an
infringement.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
that
is
exactly
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
exactly
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
the
principle
upon
which
i
propose
to
proceed
when
i
got
my
very
fair
use
rule
to
applying.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
there
have
some
very
restrictive
decisions;
one
decision
for
example
said
three
sentences
were
substantial,
but
i
know
another
reason
is
your
honor
is
the
very
strange
view
that's
grown
up
over
the
years
that
you
can't
use
anything
unless
you
put
less
affirmation,
that
rule
has
no
basis
in
fact
whatsoever.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
yes.
now
with
the
fair
use
of
rule,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
not
as
i
have
said
just
a
miscellaneous
a
tag.
it's
a
fundamental
concept
of
our
copyright
law,
just
as
fundamental
as
any
other
part
of
in
every
word
judge
(inaudible)
says
about
it.
he
says,
fair
use
was
evolved
as
a
concept
by
the
course
in
the
english
speaking
world
where
they
view
to
aiding
the
development
of
science
and
arts
by
allowing
the
use
of
copyrighted
materials,
despite
the
monopoly
of
copyright.
now
let
us
see
in
what
area
this
fair
use
rule
populates,
from
directly
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
we
have
on
the
one
hand
this
rule
of
substantiality
which
is
the
rule
the
lower
court
applies
stated
conversely,
no
taking
is
an
infringement
unless
it
constitutes
a
substantial
part.
there
must
be
a
substantial
taking
to
be
an
infringement.
now
the
lower
court
said
there
was
a
substantial
taking,
hence
an
infringement.
the
rule
is
there
must
be
a
substantial
taking
to
be
an
infringement.
now
that's
in
the
nature
of
our
rule
de
minimus.
it's
been
so
stated
by
some
other
courts.
the
way
you
test
that
rule,
the
way
you
find
out
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
taking,
you
take
a
look
at
the
two
works.
you'll
find
a
similarity
that
exists
between
the
two
works.
and
then
you'll
see
whether
looking
only
at
the
copyrighted
work,
the
material
in
the
copyrighted
work
that
appears
in
the
new
work
is
substantial,
is
more
than
not
de
minimus.
now
that's
a
restrictive
and
rigorous
rule
that
you
can
imagine
because
it's
usually
applied
in
cases
where
there
has
been
a
literary
effect.
somebody
has
just
walked
in
and
taken
it
and
used
it
for
their
own.
now
we
in
our
brief
set
forth
how
(inaudible)
it
is,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
a
single
sequence
from
a
movie
has
been
held
substantial.
an
incident
or
a
part
of
an
incident
in
a
play
has
been
held
a
substantial
taking.
the
using
of
three
sentences
from
one
book
was
held
a
substantial
taking.
the
using
of
the
lyrics
of
the
chorus
of
a
popular
song
is
a
substantial
taking.
all
those
are
held
substantial
taking,
under
the
substantial
taking
rule.
but
there's
an
area,
your
honors,
between
that
rule
which
says
there
must
be
a
substantial
taking
to
be
an
infringement
and
the
other
end
of
the
scale
with
which
we
concur
that
says
that
you
must
take
so
much
of
a
man's
work
that
you're
trying
to
market
his
work
as
your
own.
that's
the
area,
if
the
chief
justice
will
please,
where
the
fair
use
rule
comes
in
operation.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
certainly,
i
do,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
you
cannot
take
as
much
by
burlesque
as
will
reproduce
in
substantial
part
to
the
mind
of
the
audience,
the
thing
from
which
you
took,
so
that
it
won't
want
to
go
and
buy
or
see
the
things
from
which
you
took.
when
it
comes
to
the
point
of
substitution
where
your
substituting
in
this
burlesque
for
the
sufficiently,
so
that
the
audience's
interest
in
the
original
show
has
been
said
here
to
be
satisfied.
you've
gone
too
far
because
then
you
destroyed
or
impaired.
the
secondary
purpose
of
the
act
which
was
to
give
the
author
enough
encouragement
so
he
wouldn't
go
ahead
and
produce
these
literary
works
and
you
gave
him
that
encouragement
by
in
effect
saying,
if
you
publish,
we'll
give
you
the
right
to
have
the
monopoly
on
that
publication
and
the
right
to
gain
money
by
it
and
nobody
else
can
probably
show
work
for
a
period
of
56
years.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
but
your
honor,
that's
something
different
again.
but,
your
honor,
is
really
saying
in
that
case
is
that
they
saw
the
lampooning
so
good
that
they
thought
the
original
work
wasn't
much
worth
seeing.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
well,
but
i
think
that
answer
is
--
mr.
w.
b.
carman
without
a
doubt,
but
your
answer,
your
honor,
all
you're
doing
there
is
what
you
do
in
the
ordinary
case
of
literary
criticism
and
that's
the
best
example
of
the
fair
use
rule.
i
think
the
fair
use
rule,
your
honor,
is
an
--
mr.
w.
b.
carman
you
bet
he
can,
i
am
sorry
your
honor
he
certainly
can.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
he
certainly
can,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
cover
that
right
at
this
point.
i
will
say
that
that
principle
is
very
best
demonstrated
by
the
cases
that
deal
with
literary
criticism
and
review.
the
whole
fair
use
principle
is
best
demonstrated
by
those.
the
literary
critic
can
tell
a
story,
he
can
go
into
detail,
you're
reading
the
papers
and
you
tell
the
whole
story
of
the
motion
picture
which
you're
going
to
see
which
no
other
author
can
take.
that's
a
substantial
part
certainly,
a
critic
can
do
it.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
may
i
give,
your
honor,
the
rule
and
the
case
as
it's
laid
down
by
justice
story
because
i
think
--
mr.
w.
b.
carman
your
honor,
i
can't
give
you
any
illustration
of
a
case
because
all
of
the
literary
criticism
situations
although
is
accepted
by
all
the
courts
in
this
country
and
england
are
dicta
with
one
exception.
now
let
me,
may
i
state
what
justice
story
said
in
this
connection?
justice
story
says
this,
in
sitting
in
circuit
in
folsom
against
marsh.
no
one,
there
is
an
exception,
your
honor,
an
english
case
bell
against
white
and
which
i
think
is
directly
where
they
did
quote
a
very
substantial
part
in
the
criticism
and
it
was
held
perfectly
proper,
but
let
me
quote
justice
story's
statement.
no
one
can
doubt
that
a
reviewer
may
fairly
cite
largely
from
the
original
work,
if
his
design
be
really
and
truly
to
use
the
passages
for
the
purposes
of
fair
and
reasonable
criticism.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
as
clear
that
if
he
cites
the
more
important
parts
of
the
work
with
the
view
not
to
criticize
but
to
supersede
the
use
of
the
original
work
and
substitute
the
review
for
it
such
a
use
such
will
be
deemed
to
be
piracy.
and
justice
clifford
sitting
in
the
case,
in
circuit
in
the
case
of
lawrence
v.
dana,
said
the
same
thing,
reviewers
may
make
extract
sufficient
to
show
the
merits
or
demerits
of
the
work,
but
they
cannot
so
exercise
the
privilege
as
to
supersede
the
original
work.
and
again,
to
answer
to
your
question
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
the
wrongness
of
the
review,
may
i
quote
from
the
case
of
hill
against
whalen
where
it
says
this,
“the
reduction
in
demand,
speaking
of
a
literary
criticism
case,
to
be
a
ground
of
complaint,
must
result
from
the
partial
satisfaction
of
that
demand
by
the
alleged
infringing
production
and
a
criticism
of
the
original
work,
which
lessened
its
money
value
by
showing
that
it
was
not
worth
seeing
or
hearing,
could
not
give
any
right
of
action
for
infringement
of
copyright.
i
picked
that
for
washington
post
and
i
read
an
article
about
review
of
a
new
play
that
was
going
on
down
here
and
it
gave
the
story,
the
plan
for
rebuttal
and
i
didn't
want
and
go
and
see
the
play,
but
nobody
could
sue
the
washington
post
for
infringement
of
copyright
because
the
critic
didn't
like
the
play
and
i
was
in
(inaudible)
what
the
critic
said.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
well
the
difficulty
in
these
literary
property
cases
as
we
put
awful
jobs
on
courts
every
time
we
turn
around,
as
justice
hand
--
judge
hand
said,
he
is
trying
to
draw
the
line
between
un-copyrighted
and
copyrighted
property.
he
says
--
he
said,
nobody
have
ever
drawn
a
boundary
and
nobody
ever
can.
this
is
as
much
as
you
can
say
it.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
i
think
this
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
a
duty
of
a
court.
i
think
this,
that
if
a
court
with
finding
that
a
particular
parody
or
burlesque
was
dishonest,
if
a
person
try
to
go
just
as
close
to
the
line
as
he
could,
not
try
to
make
a
burlesque,
but
try
to
get
as
much
benefit
out
of
the
original
work
as
he
could
in
a
sly
way
without
quite
stepping
over
that
line
which
i
mentioned,
where
he
substituted
for
it,
and
i
think
if
the
court
found
out
or
had
that
feeling,
they
would
say
it's
not
a
fair
use,
because
the
principle
of
fair
use
your
honor,
is
the
principle
of
the
copyrighted
act
itself
that
is
to
promote
science
and
the
useful
arts
and
you're
not
promoting
it,
if
you
permit
them
to
act
dishonestly.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
but
i
think
the
same
is
--
i
think
the
same
is
true
of
criticism
your
honor,
i
think
the
same
rule
is
applied.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
your
honor
--
mr.
w.
b.
carman
there
are
other
cases.
there
are
no
cases
as
closely
in
point
as
a
criticism
and
parody
case,
and
for
this
reason.
the
reason
literary
criticism
is
so
given
such
broad
use
is
this.
in
the
first
place
it's
a
very
valuable
art,
the
art
of
criticism
and
then
the
second
place,
the
normal
critics
got
to
use
the
work
if
he
is
going
to
do
a
job,
he
can't
write
a
book,
if
he
doesn't
tell
what
the
book
is
about
and
usually
he's
going
to
quote
them,
so
that
in
order
to
promote
science
and
the
useful
art
we're
going
to
give
that
critic
the
broad
extent
of
this
rule
of
fair
use
within
the
area
if
it
please
the
court
of
fair
use.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
weighing
on
the
one
hand,
the
claim
of
monopoly
of
the
offer,
the
claim
to
be
exclusive
just
to
be
exclusive,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
public
interest
and
the
public
need
in
making
the
particular
use.
now
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
for
example
to
many
of
it
through
the
dictionary
cases
and
to
the
other
cases
of
fair
use.
we've
the
fair
use
doctrine
for
example
in
treatises
where
one
historian
will
write
a
book
and
he'll
go
and
get
a
lot
of
information
and
maybe
quote
quite
a
bit
from
other
historian.
all
we've
like
in
cases
of
text
books
and
we
have
written
cases
of
synopsis
and
we
have,
we
have
a
number
of
incidental
uses,
all
of
which
are
set
forth
in
my
book
–
in
our
brief
and
your
honors
we'll
find
an
article
that
collects
most
of
the
cases
in
six
as
kept
copyright
symposium
at
page
43.
now
you
don't
permit
so
much
of
a
use
in
the
case
of
the
historian
who
goes
to
book
and
gets
some
information
on
it,
but
as
you
do
in
the
literary
criticism
cases,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
historian
doesn't
have
to
go
there.
he
can
go
back
and
do
all
of
his
own
original
research
if
he
wants
to,
but
literary
critic
can't.
like
the
parodist
the
literary
critic
has
to
operate
on
something
that's
already
there,
but
the
historian
can,
so
you're
going
to,
in
these
cases,
you're
going
to
measure,
you're
going
to
weigh
and
the
amount
that's
taken
is
going
to
be,
is
going
to
be
one
important
part.
it's
not
going
to
be
the
major
part,
it's
not
going
to
be
the
substantiality
rule,
like
mechanical
rule.
you're
not
only
going
to
say
how
much
did
he
take,
you're
going
to
say,
why
did
he
take,
what
did
he
do
with
what
he
got,
what
product
did
he
produce,
and
is
it
necessary
or
desirable
for
the
progress
of
science
and
the
arts,
can
he
be
permitted
to
take
or
on
the
contrary,
will
the
science
and
the
arts,
will
the
useful
arts
in
the
dissemination
of
knowledge
be
held
if
you
don't
let
him
take
it.
now
it's
clear
the
substantiality
rule
is
not
proper
test.
i've
already
given
the
literary
criticism
cases
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
nobody
else
with
literary
criticism
statements
could
use
the,
tell
about
the
whole
story
of
the
play
or
a
book,
or
quote
copiously
from
it
if
he
wasn't
going
to
do
it
for
literary
criticism
because
if
he
did
he
would
be
infringing
those
exclusive
rights
which
the
copyright
act
says,
but
the
critic
can
do
it.
because
it's
a
public
interest
that
he
do,
do
it
and
therefore
we
won't
let
the
office
say,
well,
i'm
the
exclusive
owner,
so
i
won't
let
you
use
any
of
my
work,
even
though
it
doesn't
hurt
me
financially.
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't
interfere
with
my
right
to
market
my
own
work.
i'll
give
one
more
example
of
the
fact
that
the
substantiality
rule
is
not
the
basic
rule.
it's
been
a
held
in
two
other
case,
one
is
cited
in
mr.
selvin
and
one
in
ours,
the
robbins
case
in
our
reply
and
the
john's
case
and
mr.
selvin's
brief,
that
the
taking
of
a
single
course
from
a
copyrighted
song
is
a
substantial
taking,
but
on
four
occasions
it's
been
held
that
the
use
of
a
single
course
from
the
copyright
song
is
a
fair
use
and
it's
depended
on
how
it
was
used
in
one
case,
in
an
article,
about
the
green
bay
packers,
they
use
the
green
bay
packers
song,
held
it
a
fair
use.
in
another
case,
in
an
article
about
the
(inaudible)
if
the
pro
white
they
use
the
old
perils
of
pauline
song
that
we
remember
many
years
ago,
held
the
fair
use.
in
another
case
in
the
story,
where
(inaudible)
he
quoted
a
popular
song
as
an
incident,
held
to
be
fair
use.
in
another
case,
a
singer
is
saying
the
chorus
of
a
popular
song,
held
a
fair
use
because
in
those
situations
there
wasn't
any
destruction
of
this
marketability
right,
and
it
was
in
the
public
interest
of
(inaudible)
and
therefore
the
court
said,
there
is
no
infringement
in
those
situations.
now
it's
our
position
your
honor
that
parody
and
burlesque
are
entitled
to
the
same
rights,
be
measured
by
this
same
kind
of
measurement
as
literary
criticism,
and
for
the
same
reasons,
not
because
they
are
criticism,
they
are,
a
parody
can
be
a
very
vital
criticism.
i
don't
think
there
was
ever
any
better
criticism
than
fielding's
shamela
when
he
hit
at
richardson's
pamela,
but
it's
not
because
it
and
most
parodies
are
critics
because
most
parodies
that
make
people
think
of
themselves
well,
really
was
that
original
(inaudible)
as
i
thought
it
was
when
i
heard
it.
the
parody
kind
of
gives
you
a
little
doubt
in
your
mind,
but
that
isn't
the
reason.
the
reason
why
parodies
and
burlesques
are
entitled
to
the
same
fair
use
as
is
literary
criticism,
is
for
the
same
reasons.
first,
it's
an
important
art.
it's
one
that
we
ought
to
protect
and
foster,
and
second,
it's
got
to
use
the
substantial
part
of
the
original
in
order
to
live
and
to
grow.
i
don't
have
to
do
much
arguing.
i
don't
think
about
saying
that
parody
and
burlesque
is
an
important
art.
it's
as
old
–
older
than
the
greek.
somebody
and
i
don't
know
who
it
was,
once
said,
that
the
first
parodist
was
the
witty
neighbor
of
the
first
(inaudible)
and
it
goes
back
as
(inaudible)
in
the
greeks.
most
of
our
great
writers,
many
of
our
great
writers
have
written
parodies,
fatery,
(inaudible)
fielding
i've
already
mentioned,
kipling
has
written
them.
it's
a
special
kind
of
art
that
the
freedom
loving
people
like.
americans,
and
english
and
french
are
the
real
artists
at
parody.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
i
have
never
your
honor.
i've
never
heard
of
a
russian
or
a
german
parody.
there
maybe
some
but
i
never
heard
of.
it's
a
kind
of
a
thing
that
we
like
to
laugh
at
each
other
and
we
like
to
laugh
on
ourselves
and
that's
what
a
parody
does.
it's
sort
of
says
in
effect
why
so
(inaudible)
little
man,
you
have
been
awfully
serious
about
this.
you
see
how,
and
that's
a
good
thing
for
all
of
us.
it's
a
wonderful
thing
and
we
ought
to
protect
it.
it's,
i
don't
think
i
have
to
argue
that's
a
important
art.
now
secondly
your
honor,
it's
got
to
use
a
substantial
part
of
the
work
and
the
plagiarism
sense.
i
know
that
mr.
selvin
will
disagree
with
me
on
this
subject,
but
i
think
that
from
the
very
nature
of
this
kind
of
an
art
it
must
use
a
substantial
part
of
the
work.
after
all
it's
got
to
use
the
original,
you
can't
have
a
parody
without
an
original,
and
if
it's
going
to
strike
at
the
story
just
as
gaslight
struck
at
the
story
in
this
situation,
it's
going
to
have
to
use
a
part
of
that
story
or
it
doesn't
have
any
effect.
i
think
if
your
honors
will
read
and
look
at
the
parodies
in
the
appendixes
which
we
have
summarized
parodies
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
you
would
realize
that
every
one
of
them
took
what
that
de
minimis
or
substantiality
rule
would
call
substantial.
they
have
to,
to
get
any
effect
to
them
and
get
a
new
(inaudible).
mr.
selvin
suggests
where
you
can
use
un-copyrighted
property?
you
can
use
ideas
or
concepts
and
you
can
do
it
that
way?
oh,
you
can
sure.
there
have
been
parodies
of
style
yes,
many
of
them.
there
have
been
parodies
that
don't
strike
at
particular
book,
many
of
them.
you
can
do
that.
i
suppose
you
can
paint
a
great
work
of
art
and
you
don't
have
to
use
color,
but
when
you
come
down
and
having
a
thing
that's
going
to
live,
after
all
these
things
are
un-copyrighted.
they
are
not
protectable
because
of
their
generalities,
and
the
parody
is
got
to
be
protected.
now
i
have
got
parody
never
substitutes
for
the
original.
it
never
detracts
from
the
people's
enjoyment
of
that
original.
if
it
does,
if
it
substitutes,
if
you
can
go
and
see
the
parody
and
say,
well
i
don't
care
i
have
seen
all
of
my
need
to
see
the
original
show
then
it's
an
infringement
your
honor.
it
comes
into
that,
but
that
isn't
what
a
parody
does.
the
parodist
doesn't
sell
the
original.
he
tells
the
people
--
he
doesn't
say
look
i
am
showing
you
the
original.
he
says,
this
original
belongs
to
the
man
who
wrote
it,
now
look
what
i
do
with
it.
you
remember,
you
remember
how
this
person
did
this
line.
for
example,
let's
take
lewis
carroll's
famous
parody,
‘you
are
old,
father
william
the
young
man
said,
that's
a
direct
parody.
that
line
is
directly
taken
from
a
very
moral
poem
by
southey,
and
i
am
sure
that
when
the
lewis
carroll's
poem
came
out
everybody
saw
it,
well
look
at
how
moral
and
look
at
how
pious
southey
was
and
look
what
lewis
carroll
does
with
it.
and
he
wasn't
trying
to
sell
southey's
work
and
we
in
gaslight
--
in
our
parody
we
weren't
trying
to
sell
gaslight,
we
weren't
trying
to
show
to
the
people
what
they
did
in
gaslight.
we
were
trying
to
show
to
the
people,
to
say
to
them,
this
you
remember
what
they
did
in
gaslight,
look
how
we
fixed
it
up.
look
how
we
made
it
funny,
look
how
we
changed
it
and
create
that
aspect
in
the
minds
of
the
operators.
so,
i
think
that
the
parody
and
burlesque
fulfill
all
of
the
requirements.
for
the
right
of
fair
use
just
as
literary
criticism
does,
not
because
it
is
criticism,
but
because
it's
an
art
that
we
want
to
protect.
we
want
to
have
more
parodies
like
those
i
put
in
our
appendix.
we
want
to
keep,
we
don't
want
to
lose
it,
we
don't
want
to
say
that
come
1958
those
parodies
die
in
america.
and
it's
an
art
that
we
want
to
protect
and
those
parodies
had
to
use
what
would
have
been
a
substantial
part
under
the
plagiarism
rule
of
the
other
work.
now
i
would
like
to
cover
briefly
two
or
three
criticisms
of
this
rule
that
respondents
have
put
up.
they
say
in
the
first
place,
well
your
parody
was
commercial.
you
put
it
on
television
and
after
all
the
american
tobacco
company
sponsored
it,
so
you
had
a
commercial
use.
your
honor,
it
wasn't
commercial,
the
parody
wasn't
commercial.
it's
certainly
isn't
commercial
because
somebody
paid
the
author,
and
i
don't
think
it's
commercial
because
it
happened
to
be
the
american
tobacco
company
to
pay
the
author.
the
parody
wasn't
an
advertisement.
that's
simply
a
new
method
which
we
have
developed
over
the
years
in
this
country
for,
of
economy,
of
the
economics
of
it.
television
and
radio
operates
and
they
produce
their
works
of
art
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
and
they
are
paid
for
by
advertising
sponsor,
but
that
doesn't
make
what
they
produced
is
commercial.
there
is
nothing
commercial
about
that,
perhaps
i
won't
say
that
auto
light
was
the
work
of
art,
that's
the
name
of
our
parody.
i
won't
say
that
it
was.
it
gave
me
a
lot
of
fun
and
i
think
it
was
a
much
work
of
art
as
a
lot
of
movies
i
have
seen
and
lot
of
books
i
have
read,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that.
but
if
it
wasn't,
may
be
tomorrow
one
will
be
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
put
on
television
and
sponsored
by
a
sponsor
doesn't
make
parody
advertising
or
the
parody
commercial,
any
more
than
it
would
be,
if
the
bob
merrill
company
should
decide
to
give
away
a
bunch
of
books
for
the
purpose
of
advertising,
not
anymore
your
honor,
then
is
the
case
where
the
artist
or
(inaudible)
where
right
next
in
the
middle
of
your
story
you
see
the
advertisement
for
the
buick
automobile
and
probably
the
writer
of
that
story
got
most
of
his
money
in
the
record
from
the
general
motors
who
bought
the
advertisement,
but
that
doesn't
make
the
story
commercial.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
well,
i
would
imagine
that
perhaps
the
same
commercial
would
be,
would
be
commercial
your
honor.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
well,
i
will
say
that
too
your
honor.
now
the
other
point
that
mr.
selvin
makes,
first
he
says,
well,
we
ought
to
have
the
right
to
make
the
parody.
you
took
away
that
right.
we
shouldn't
write
to
make
our
own
parody.
well,
your
honor
i
don't
think
the
copyright
law
intended
to
give
him
a
right
to
make
his
own
parody
anymore
than
it
intended
to
give
him
a
right
to
control
criticism.
he
might
just
as
well
have
said,
well
you
can't
choose
anything
in
this
article
criticizing
my
work,
unless
you
get
my
permission
and
you
got
to
say
good
things
about
it.
so
i
don't
think
--
now
another
point
that
they
try
to
make
it
is
there
is
competition.
well,
there
isn't
any
competition
between
our
work
and
his
work
as
being
the
same
work.
surely,
there
is
competition
but
every
parody
competes
for
the
eyes
and
the
ears
of
whoever
is
going
to
see
it,
it
only
goes
to
the
people
who
can
read
or
see
or
hear.
take
ms.
skinner's
wonderful
parody
and
i
hope
your
honors
have
all
read
it,
called,
'for
whom
the
gong
sounds'
and
it's
a
wonderful
parody
of
mr.
hemingway's,
'for
whom
the
bell
tolls'.
we
have
it
set
out
in
full
in
our
appendix,
and
i
hope
you
have
all
read
it.
now
that
competed
it.
if
i
had
$2.5
and
went
down
to
(inaudible)
to
buy
a
book,
i
could
either
buy
'for
whom
the
bell
tolls'
or
'for
whom
the
gong
sounds'.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
i
have
now
doubt,
but
certainly
that
doesn't
make
ms.
skinner's
parody
or
burlesque
illegitimate,
because
of
that
fact.
in
the
turn
of
the
century
here
(inaudible)
field
used
to
put
on
--
that's
before
my
time,
but
(inaudible)
field
used
to
put
on
a
burlesque
in
one
theater
right
next
door
the
original
would
be
playing,
and
i
could
walk
down
and
had
i
been
there
and
have
taken
my
choice.
now
i
didn't
--
wouldn't
have
gone
to
see
(inaudible)
field
because
i
thought
i
was
going
to
see
the
show
that
was
being
on
next
door,
it
would
have
been
a
kind
of
thing
i
wanted
to
see
with
(inaudible)
field
is
dead.
so
i
don't
think
that
going
to
competition.
you
should
have
fair.
then
the
final
thing
is
as
i
have
already
mentioned
and
mr.
selvin
says,
well
maybe
you
have
got
a
dim
view
or
a
picture
from
looking
at
this
parody.
well
that's
something
he
is
got
to
expect.
i
mean
the
writer
of
a
book
has
got
to
expect
that
somebody
is
going
to
take
a
dim
view
of
his
book
and
i
don't
think
he
can
complain
about
that
kind
of
a
situation.
i
think
that's
one
he
must
face
by
himself.
so
basically
it
seems
to
me
parody
has
these
rights.
now
your
honor,
we
do
not
want
to
get
very
much
help
out
to
the
authorities.
we
have
got
them
all
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
we
have
got
them
set
forth
and
mr.
selvin
going
to
set
forth
in
his
brief,
but
you
won't
get
much
help
out
of
the
authorities,
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression,
neither
the
case
authorities
nor
the
text
books.
i
agree
with
mr.
selvin,
most
of
the
american
text
say
you
can
parody
and
burlesque,
it's
fair
use,
but
they
don't
say
why
and
they
don't
say
much
about
it.
there
are
two
notable
exceptions
which
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention.
first,
a
very
fine
article
by
a
judge
yankwich
in
33
canadian
bar
review
on
this
case
and
on
this
problem,
which
is
entitled
parody
and
burlesque
in
the
law
of
copyright
and
secondly
a
very
extensive
note
in
56
columbia
law.
and
i
would
to
take
a
moment
to
talk
about
the
second
parody
case,
there
has
only
been
two
really
in
the
country
and
that
came
up
subsequent
to
this
case
it
is
what
i
call
the
attorney
case.
it
was
a
case
of
columbia
broadcast,
columbia
company,
columbia
pictures
company
against
national
broadcasting
company
in
137
federal
supp.
348
and
that
was
a
case
in
which
after
the
benny
parody,
since
these
are
put
on
one
of
the
picture
from
here
to
eternity
called
here
to
obscurity.
in
those
days
your
honor
we
had
a
few
parodies
on
television.
since
this
case
got
started
we
don't
have
many
more
because
nobody
can
face
that
substantiality
rule,
nobody
would
dare
to
write
a
parody
with
a
substantiality
rules
during
the
phase
of
de
minimis
rule,
so
we
don't
have
them.
this
case
has
done
that.
much
it's
almost
--
mr.
w.
b.
carman
how
can
i
tell
what
your
honor?
mr.
w.
b.
carman
because
i
watch
television,
if
your
honor
please
and
i
don't
see
them
anymore.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
there
may
be,
but
i
think
this
is
--
knowing
the
industry
a
little
bit
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
reason.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
no
it
is
not,
neither
half
of
it
your
honor
in
the
--
since
these
are
put
on
this
parody
called
from
here
to
obscurity
and
columbia
sued
him.
that
case
also
came
before
judge
carter
and
he
decided
and
favored
the
defendants.
he
decided
there
was
no
one
infringement.
he
was
faced
with
a
dilemma
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
we
had
--
the
obscurity
hadn't
used
what
he
called
the
storyline
to
the
same
extent
that
they
had
in
this
situation.
judge
carter
was
somewhat
obsessed
by
this
storyline
idea
that
the
parody
was
bad
if
it
took
the
storyline.
but,
he
thought
we
ought
to
be
able
to
do
the
eternity
case.
he
thought
we
ought
to
be
able
to
do
that.
at
the
same
time
in
that
year
since
we've
learned
a
little
bit
more
about
how
to
present
a
case
and
maybe
judge
carter
thought
a
little
bit
more
about
it,
he
also
came
to
the
conclusion
as
he
says
in
his
opinion
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
take
more
if
you
were
using
a
burlesque
or
a
parody
than
you
were
on
a
serious
proposition.
you
remember
his
first
rule
was
treat
it
the
same
as
any
other
appropriation,
but
in
this
case
he
decided
to
really
opt
it,
but
he
had
a
dilemma.
he
had
many
cases
in
front
of
him
in
which
he
said
the
substantiality
rule
was
the
basis
of
it,
that's
all,
he
(inaudible)
point
of
dilemma,
and
he
said
in
the
eternity
case,
yes,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
take
more
than
you
could
if
it
was
a
serious
case,
so
long
as
it
is
substantial
or
you
can
see
the
obvious
the
contradiction
that
arose
in
that
situation.
now,
on
the
ultimate
issue
of
fact
in
this
case
your
honor
is
to
whether
applying
the
rule
for
which
i
have
argued,
the
rule
of
fair
use
which
is
that
in
this
area,
this
area
between
no
infringement
on
the
one
side,
and
all
was
infringement
when
you
substitute
on
the
other,
you
ought
to
consider
the
rights
of
the
public,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act.
upon
the
–
(inaudible)
an
issue
of
fact
is
to
whether
this
parody
did
substitute
and
therefore
was
back,
all
right,
that
matter
has
never
been
decided.
the
lower
court
simply
said,
if
you
take
more
than
a
substantial,
it's
an
infringement.
so
that
issue
wasn't
that
--
which
we
feel
is
entirely
wrong,
that
issue
was
never
been
heard;
perhaps
this
court
will
prefer
to
send
the
case
back
to
be
heard
again.
maybe
this
court
would
like
to
see
the
two
works
and
decide
that
issue
of
fact
for
itself.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
i
would
say
that
the
issue
of
fact
in
this
case
is
this.
does
this
parody
of
ours
violate
the
fair
use
rule
in
that,
it
take
so
much
of
the
original
work
that
it
substitutes
therefore
in
the
minds
of
the
audience
and
therefore
destroys
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
whip
the
purpose
to
give
him
in
for
a
limited
period
of
time
the
right
to
market
his
own
work
free
from
somebody
else's
marketing
that
same
work.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
from
the
original,
and
that's
all.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
qed,
that's
what
this
court
--
mr.
w.
b.
carman
that's
exactly
correct
your
honor.
now,
i
don't
think
i
am
not
going
to
argue
this
--
the
matter
of
fact
because
if
this
court
wants
to
see
those
pictures,
it's
another
case
where
10,000
words
don't
equal
one
picture.
that's
a
determination
and
the
only
way
you
can
determine
is
by
looking
at
the
pictures
themselves.
i
will
say
this
that
i
don't
believe
this
court
or
any
court
would
ever
holds
that
there
has
been
a
substitution
that
what
we
did
was
put
on
gaslight
in
whole
substantial
part,
we
didn't,
we
put
on
our
parody
of
gaslight.
we
didn't
put
on
gaslight,
we
didn't
try
to
sell
gaslight,
and
we
didn't
interfere
with
their
selling
gaslight.
now
your
honor,
when
this
case
was
in
the
lower
court,
mr.
selvin
said
and
i
think
properly
so
that
this
was
a
case
of
principle.
the
principle
for
which
he
contends
which
is
the
substantiality
rule,
means
that
while
you
do
protect
the
naked
exclusivity
rights
of
the
author,
you
do
so
by
hamstringing
if
not
destroying
parodies
and
burlesques.
the
principle
for
which
we
contend
on
the
other
hand
while
it
maintains
the
copyright
owner's
right
to
market
his
work
free
of
the
claims
than
anybody
else
to
market
the
same
work
and
that's
what
rightly
was
given
so
that
there
would
be
encouragement
to
produce,
nevertheless
permits
parodies
and
burlesque
to
continue.
it
will
permit
not
only
us,
we
are
here
today,
but
those
who
come
after
us
to
see
and
hear
parodies
at
the
time
we
have
in
our
appendix
there
to
see
again
or
hear
again
a
chandler,
a
salt
water
taffy,
a
rupert
the
resselmbler,
of
for
whom
gone
son,
those
types
of
things
that
the
future
can
see
in
here,
they
took
substantial
work,
yes,
they
took
substantial
parts,
yes,
but
it
will
permit
that
to
be
done
in
the
future,
and
thereby
in
my
opinion,
it
will
fulfill
the
constitutional
mandate
to
promote
these
useful
arts
rather
destroying
them
or
hamstringing
them
to
the
point
where
they
won't
be
effectively
done.
mr.
w.
b.
carman
may
i
simply
say
to
the
court,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
except
to
say
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referring
to
the
case
of
bell
against
white
case
in
eight
english
report
new
series
of
141,
that
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
for
asking
the
question
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
up.
in
that
case
a
quarter
of
the
article
was
used,
quarter
of
the
--
one-fourth
of
the
work
was
used
in
a
criticism.
the
critic
had
quoted
one-fourth
of
the
work
and
then
commented
on
it,
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
was
a
fair
use.
