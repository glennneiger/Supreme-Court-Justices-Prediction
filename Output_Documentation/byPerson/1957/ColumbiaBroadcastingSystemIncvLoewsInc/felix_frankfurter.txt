you
may
need
to
rely
on
the
memory
of
the
audience
to
the
original?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
this
was
a
test
case,
mr.
carman?
justice
felix

and
people
just
wanted
to
get
a
ruling
from

even
principles
can
be

can
have
standing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you're
not
going
to
argue
that
we
have
to
judge
in
each
case
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
promote
--
justice

right!
and
release
the

mr.
carman
it
isn't
relevant
i
think
to
your
problem,
except
your
answer
under
substantial
use,
but
why
is
it
that
even
taking
a
sentence
or
a
paragraph
of
a
whole
book
now
requires
or
is
assumed
to
require
permission
of
the
author
and
publishers?
is
it
because
there
have
been
very
restricted
decisions
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course
a
nice
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wondered
if
that
test
could
scarcely
were
not
in
that
case,
if
the
man
is
(inaudible)
is
good
enough,
you
wouldn't
want
to
see
the
original;
it
would
expire
very

justice

that's
right.
justice

the
original
work
could
be
shabby
and
yet
entitled
to
copyright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
a
literary
critic
in
order
to
show
his
disregard
to
this
or
that
bestseller
just
quote
chunks
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
just
have
understood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
can
edmund
wilson
just
quote
three
chapters
from
books
that
i
could
name,
but
more
in
order
to
show
how
bad
they
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
give
me
an
illustration
of
a
case
in
which
a
critic
just
quotes
verbatim
chapters
in
order
to
prove
that
it's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
justice

test
that
it's
the
subjective
determination,
think
of
--
just
apply
those
words.
is
the
critic
doing
this
in
order
to
indicate,
to
make
clear
what
kind
of
style
it
is
or
is
he
doing
it
really
to
do
the
book
in
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
boundary,
but
i'm
talking
of
direction,
which
is
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
question,
it
didn't
deal
with,
i
haven't
got
the
parody,
i've
got
---
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
another
category
of
these
problems
mr.
carman,
the
dictionary
cases
or
the
cases
where
you
get
a
scheme
out
of
an
author
and
you
use
the
scheme
in
your
own
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
you
can't
parallel
the
literary
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
hope
that
you
would
mention
max
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
make
it
commercial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
a
bit
surprised
that
you
don't
say
--
the
commercial
argument
and
so
what.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
both
took
even
greater
author
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
brave
industry,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
restate
what
you
think
is
an
issue
of
fact
that
would
be
appropriately
--
that
would
be
an
appropriate
test
for
adjudication
by
the
trier
of
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
i
followed
your
argument
as
i
did
with
intentionity,
very
carefully,
you
would
say
that
the
error
of
the
lower
court
or
courts,
both
of
them,
lies
in
the
fact,
they
thought
that
they
apply
the
test
of
substantial
content
taking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
have
a
substantial,
whatever
that
maybe,
even
in
this
case
it
was,
a
substantial
content
demonstrated
by
parallel
columns,
qed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
selvin,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
i
have
asked
of
mr.
carman.
i
suppose
a
voluminous
single
body
of
writers
in
english
is
the
writing
of
critics,
critical
literature,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
(inaudible)
literary
criticism,
say
by,
matthew
arnold,
by
(inaudible),
by
mccarthy
the
voluminous
writer,
critical
writers
and
by
reviewers,
people
who
dealt
fiercely
with
the
literature
of
their
day,
whether
there
has
turned
up
a
case
in
which
one
of
these
severe
devastating
critics
in
order
to
make
his
point
about
the
flatulence
or
the
emptiness
or
the
undesirability
in
whatever
form
and
desirability
may
express
it
there,
whether
such
a
critics
in
order
to
prove
his
point
quoted
elaborate
from
the
author
criticized
and
to
other
such
situation
has
turned
up
in
the
court
in
your
investigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
gave
the
campbell
case
and
that
is
different,
because
there
was
an
excuse,
but
i
am
trying
to
think
of
honest
and
these
moral
questions
seem
to
me
to
complicate
it.
a
critic
who
wanted
to
do
really
damn
a
work
and
then
prove
his
object
by
quoting
just
blocks
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
the
question
of
just
finding
out
whether
there
are
six
inches
of
it
or
one
ounce
of
the
weight
of
the
book
as
i
gather
from
what
you
say.
it
is
a
question
of
taking
it
to
make
a
point,
but
i
wonder
how
much
you
may
take
to
make
a
point?
this
is
pretty
one-side,
whether
this
was
to
make
a
point
or
make
to
make
something
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
be
very
much
surprised
if
these
questions
as
deceptible
and
as
arithmetic
(inaudible)
measurement.
