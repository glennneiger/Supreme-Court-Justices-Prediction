mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
being
conceded
as
indeed
it
has
been
conceded
since
the
inception
of
this
case
that
what
was
taken
by
the
petitioner's
parody
a
part
was
the
kind
of
a
taking
which
all
of
the
decisions
hold
to
being
infringement
of
copyright.
the
difference
between
mr.
carman
and
myself
becomes
somewhat
a
narrow
one.
his
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
parody
because
of
its
peculiar
needs
must
be
subjected
to
a
somewhat
different
rule
in
the
respect,
in
respect
of
what
it
may
take
from
a
copyrighted
work
than
any
other
work,
and
that
the
doctrine
of
fair
use
so
called
is
not
as
i
hope
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
before
i
am
through
it
is,
merely
a
convenient
expression
for
the
proposition
that
one
does
not
infringe
a
copyrighted
work
if
he
takes
less
than
a
substantial
part
of
its
copyrightable
elements.
now,
since
the
right
which
was
held
infringed
here
is
a
statutory
right
and
cannot
exist
apart
from
statute,
perhaps
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
start
is
with
the
statute.
but,
before
starting
with
the
statute,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
constitutional
power
pursuant
to
which
the
statute
was
enacted,
and
even
beyond
that
to
the
legal
context
in
which
the
constitution
was
enacted
and
with
which
legal
context,
the
framers,
certainly
those
who
were
primarily
responsible
for
the
copyright
power
were
familiar.
it
had
been
determined
in
england
sometime
before
the
constitution
was
adopted,
and
i
think
the
best
expression
of
it,
certainly
the
first
expression
of
it
was
in
the
judgment
of
justice
willes
in
millar
against
taylor
which
was
decided
i
believe
in
1769,
that
the
teaching
of
a
copyright
work
was
free
for
all
to
use,
but,
when
an
author
published
a
book
even
though
copyrighted
under
the
then
existing
english
statute
which
was
the
first
copyright
statute
so
far
as
we
know
under
the
anglo-american
jurisdiction,
he
presented
to
the
public
his
ideas,
his
intellectual
conceptions,
his
theme,
the
teaching
of
the
work,
and
that
all
were
free
to
use
that
for
any
purpose
which
they
desired.
but
and
he
justified
that
or
pretty
much
the
reason
that
mr.
carman
has
stated
that
it
was
necessary
and
desirable
to
promote
the
progress
of
the
arts
and
sciences
by
disseminating
information
and
learning
the
researchers
and
discoveries
of
the
learner.
but,
he
went
on
to
say
in
effect
the
manner
of
expression,
the
arrangement
of
the
words,
the
sequence
of
the
words,
the
individual
touch
that
the
author
gives,
the
concrete
form
into
which
he
puts
the
abstractions,
the
intellectual
abstractions
are
the
things
which
copyright
protect.
now,
madison
and
pinckney
who
proposed
the
copyright
power
in
the
constitutional
convention
were
undoubtedly
familiar
with
millar
against
taylor.
it
was
not
only
the
leading
case
at
that
time,
but
it
was
about
the
only
decision
in
england
at
that
time
as
well
as
donaldson
against
beckett
which
came
up
in
the
house
of
lords
after
millar
against
taylor.
when
they
drafted
the
constitutional
power
reciting
its
purpose
to
promote
the
progress
of
the
sciences
and
useful
arts;
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
they
had
in
mind
this
very
proposition
that
had
already
been
laid
down
in
the
english
cases.
now,
if
they
were
thinking
of
promotion
by
disseminating
the
teaching
of
the
work,
but
not
by
making
the
work
public
property
and
so
far
as
its
concrete
form
or
expression
is
concerned,
and
i
think
that's
shown
by
another
part
of
the
same
constitutional
provision
which
is
just
as
important
as
the
statement
of
its
purpose
and
that
is
the
method
by
which
that
purpose
was
to
be
achieved,
and
the
method
was
by
securing
to
authors
the
exclusive
right
to
their
writings.
now,
the
congress
conformably
to
that
power
has
enacted
from
time
to
time
copyright
statutes,
resulting
in
1909
in
a
general
revision
which
is
our
present
statute
with
very
few
changes
since
then.
the
right
which
it
confers
as
it
must
be
under
the
constitution
is
an
exclusive
right,
and
that
right
in
relation
to
our
problem
is
this,
to
copy
an
event,
to
perform,
represent,
or
exhibit,
to
make
or
cause
to
be
made
a
transcription
or
recording
by
which
in
any
manner
or
by
any
method,
the
work
maybe
performed,
represented,
or
exhibited,
and
to
perform,
represent,
and
exhibit.
so
far
as
statutory
language
is
concerned,
the
act
makes
no
distinction
among
the
classes
of
works
or
the
classes
of
persons
who
are
subject
to
the
exclusive
right
thus
granted.
it
carves
out
no
exception
for
parodies
or
for
parodists.
it
carves
out
no
exception
for
any
kind
of
work.
there
is
significance
in
the
use
in
the
statute
of
the
phrase
in
any
manner
or
by
any
method.
the
drafters
there
were
not
indulging
in
the
favor
of
lawyer's
habit
of
cumulating
synonyms.
they
were
referring
to
two
different
ideas,
in
any
manner,
meaning
in
any
mode
or
in
any
medium,
by
any
method
meaning
by
any
mechanical
means
which
maybe
available
to
transcribe
or
record
or
reproduce
the
work
if
it
is
a
work
susceptible
of
that
kind
of
expression.
now
the
1909
revision
was
not
just
another
day's
work
in
the
congress
of
that
era.
that
provision
was
the
product
of
over
100
years
experience
with
copyright
statutes
beginning
in
1790
as
far
as
the
federal
statute
is
concerned
and
constantly
amended
over
the
time
and
amended
i
think
with
some
significance,
always
in
the
direction
of
broadening
the
coverage
of
copyright,
so
that
eventually
as
we
have
it
now,
virtually
all
the
forms
of
creative
expression
are
now
subject
to
the
copyright
act,
maybe
copyrighted,
and
therefore
obtain
the
exclusive
right
to
which
the
statute
refers.
it
was
the
product
of
more
than
that
100
years
experience
and
that
broadening
trend
that
has
continued
ever
since
the
first
statute.
it
was
the
product
of
a
very
determined
movement
among
representatives
of
all
of
the
creative
branches
of
the
arts
in
this
country,
who
felt
that
the
copyright
statutes
were
patchwork
as
of
the
turn
of
the
century,
but
they
didn't
adequately
meet
modern
demands.
a
movement
which
was
headed
up
considerable
part
by
men
such
as
victor
herbert,
john
philip
sousa,
mark
twain
and
certainly
the
latter
was
no
stranger
to
parody
or
burlesque.
the
congress
itself
or
a
committee
of
the
congress,
committee
on
patents,
held
extensive
and
intensive
and
elaborate
theories
on
the
revision
of
the
copyright
act.
as
the
report
says,
all
of
us
who
desired
to
be
heard
were
heard.
we
cannot
assume
in
view
that
history
and
a
few
of
the
ancient
lineage
of
parody
to
which
mr.
carman
refers,
we
cannot
assume
that
the
congress
was
unaware
of
the
act
or
indifferent
to
the
needs
of
it,
and
when
it
failed
to
make
any
exception
in
favor
of
parody
or
parodists
of
the
1909
revision
broadly
granting
an
exclusive
right
as
it
did,
its
failure
was
significant.
had
the
congress
wanted
the
exception
for
which
mr.
carman
speaks,
it
no
doubt
would
have
said
so
in
1909
or
in
the
50
years
since.
now,
we
come
to
the
argument
of
necessity.
in
all
through
this
case
the
petitioner's
reliance
has
been
on
the
argument
of
necessity.
you
can't
have
parody
they
say
and
they
have
said
it
from
the
start,
you
can't
have
parody
without
taking
something
from
the
work
that
you
are
parodying.
well,
i
would
like
to
suggest
in
the
first
instance
with
respect
to
that
argument,
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
question
of
policy
for
the
congress
to
determine,
not
a
question
of
fact
or
a
question
of
law
for
the
court
to
decide.
and
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
indicated,
we
can't
assume
that
the
congress
went
ahead
blindly
for
forgetting
parody
when
it
enacted
the
present
law.
but
if
it
is
a
question
with
which
we
should
be
concerned
in
this
case,
i
make
two
further
suggestions,
that
both
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
as
a
matter
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
argument
for
necessity
is
destroyed.
no
doubt
there
are
and
have
been
in
the
thousand
years
or
more
of
which
we
know
of
parody.
there
have
been
so
called
direct
parodies,
where
some
single
specific
work
is
burlesque.
but,
by
and
large,
so
far
as
my
survey
of
the
field
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
form
an
opinion,
by
and
large
the
great
mass
of
parody
or
burlesque
is
parody
of
ideas,
of
schools
of
thought,
of
attitudes,
of
political
and
social
causes,
and
even
in
the
literally
and
dramatic
field,
not
of
specific
works,
but
of
schools
of
work.
you
take
--
following
up
mentioned
in
the
oral
argument
an
example
which
is
emphasized
in
petitioner's
brief
northanger
abbey
by
jane
austen,
yes,
northanger
abbey
started
out
as
a
lampoon,
had
something
called
the
mysteries
of
udolpho,
but,
what
it
wound
up
as
was
not
a
parody
of
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
but
of
a
class
of
novels
of
which
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
was
typical,
and
it
lampooned
not
the
specific
work
udolpho
but
the
whole
class
of
so
called
horror
novels
and
their
own
realistic
approach
to
the
problems
of
life.
and
that's
typical
of
most
burlesque
or
parody.
but,
even
in
the
direct
parody,
when
that
which
all
everybody
agrees
is
free
even
in
a
copyright
work;
it's
plot,
it's
theme,
it's
intellectual
conceptions,
it's
ideas,
it's
teaching,
when
that
is
free
to
anyone,
even
the
direct
parodist
has
all
the
material
that
he
needs
with
which
to
furnish
the
identification
with
the
original
that
is
the
basis
of
the
claim
of
necessity.
from
here
the
eternity
is
a
good
example
regardless
of
what
mr.
carson's
opinion
may
be
--
carton's
opinion
maybe
as
to
judge
carter's
--
the
reason
for
judge
carter's
decision
in
that
case,
his
decision
in
that
case
and
in
this
case
are
perfectly
consistent
with
each
other.
he
looked
at
the
words
in
each,
he
said,
in
our
case,
there
has
been
a
substantial
taking,
a
substantiality
is
measured
in
the
law
of
copyright,
but
in
the
eternity
case
there
hasn't
been,
why?
because
sid
scissors
stuck
to
the
general
coop,
the
general
theme
from
here
to
eternity.
anybody
who
saw
the
parody
and
who
had
read
either
the
novel
or
seen
the
motion
picture
would
know
immediately
what
was
being
parody.
but,
he
had
only
taken
that,
which
is
free
to
everyone,
and
he
made
a
very
good
parody,
just
as
funny
as
the
one
that's
involved
in
this
case,
if
it's
fun
that
we
are
after.
now
dr.
baxter
who
testified
as
an
expert
witness
for
the
petitioner
is
not
really
when
you
read
his
testimony
at
large,
is
not
really
in
disagreement
with
that
proposition.
dr.
baxter
is
a
very
charming
and
learned
man.
i
do
not
appreciate
either
his
honesty
or
his
fairness
or
his
learning
when
i
say
that
as
an
expert
witness,
he
was
an
advocate
just
as
the
lawyers
were
and
quite
properly
so.
nevertheless,
there
is
much
in
his
testimony,
supporting
that
idea
if
we
are
going
to
decide
this
question
in
a
lawsuit
rather
than
in
the
sort
of
an
investigation,
it
could
be
made
by
a
legislature,
there
was
much
support
to
the
idea,
that
true
parody,
true
burlesque
does
not
parallel
the
original,
never
does,
but
actually,
it
is
as
he
said
i
think
at
page
150
of
the
record,
simply
an
excuse
for
having
fun
with
an
idea.
well,
ideas
as
one
district
judge
in
new
york
said,
ideas
are
free
as
air
as
even
the
stationers'
company
in
england
would
admit.
so,
we
say
that
the
argument
of
necessity
has
no
support
actually
either
in
the
record
of
this
case
or
in
common
knowledge
as
to
the
nature
of
the
art.
well
--
and
what
about
fair
use?
fair
use
with
all
difference
to
the
many
judges
who
have
used
the
expression
is
a
tag,
it's
a
label.
and
whenever
a
legal
concept
or
a
legal
doctrine
is
given
a
tag
of
that
sort,
there
is
always
the
danger
that
if
we
concentrate
on
the
label,
we
won't
see
what's
inside
the
package,
and
that's
what's
happened
with
the
so
called
doctrine
of
fair
use
as
it
is
sought
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
fair
use
does
not
have
the
term,
fair
use
does
not
have
a
mysterious
origin.
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover,
its
first
use
or
of
an
equivalent
expression,
was
in
england
in
1810
in
a
judgment
of
lord
evelyn,
brookins
against
stacey,
the
cases
to
which
i
refer
are
all
cited
in
the
brief,
so
i
don't
stop
to
give
volume
or
page
number.
lord
evelyn
was
significantly
enough
discussing
in
that
part
of
his
opinion
the
question
of
how
far
a
critic
or
reviewer
could
go.
and
he
said
that
the
critic
or
reviewer
has
no
right
to
copy
or
reproduce
the
whole
or
a
substantial
or
material
part
of
the
copyrighted
work,
although
he
may
indulge
in
fair
quotation.
now,
it's
quite
obvious
when
you
see
it
in
the
acquisition
of
those
two
terms.
the
whole
or
a
material
part
of
the
work
on
the
one
hand,
fair
quotation
on
the
other,
that
lord
evelyn
was
not
thinking
of
where
quotation
in
the
sense
of
anything
that
would
be
more
than
substantial
itself
or
substantial.
well,
that
usage
of
translated
into
the
term
fair
use
apparently
caught
on
with
british
judges.
what
we
find
in
the
house
of
lords
in
chatterton
against
cave
which
came
about
1878,
we
find
lord
hatherly
saying,
again
discussing
the
question
of
how
far
a
critic
could
go
in
a
review.
if
the
part
taken
is
neither
material
nor
substantial,
if
in
other
words
as
some
judges
put
it
lord
hatherly
said
only
a
fair
use
is
made,
there
is
no
infringement
and
that
usage
is
continued
in
england
down
to
the
present
day,
even
though
the
act
of
1911,
the
copyright
act
of
1911
made
a
very
substantial
change
in
the
english
law
in
certain
situation.
the
american
usage
has
conformed
to
the
english
usage.
it
has
been
here
as
in
england,
simply
a
convenient
label
for
the
legal
concept
that
infringement
requires
substantial
taking
of
the
copyrightable
elements
of
the
work,
not
a
taking
of
the
taking
of
the
uncopyrightable
elements
or
something
less
than
substantial
of
the
copyrighted
elements.
in
america,
i
think
the
usage
starts
with
the
case
to
which
mr.
carman
referred,
with
mr.
justice
story's
opinion
when
on
circuit
in
folsom
against
marsh.
folsom
against
marsh
is
an
interesting
case
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
involved
copyrighting
the
private
letters
of
president
washington.
it
contains
as
an
attempt
on
mr.
justice
story's
part
to
give
some
specificity,
some
specific
content
to
the
substantiality
rule,
probably
the
most
widely
cited
and
quoted
passage
in
copyright
law
when
he
said
that
what
the
courts
will
look
at
are
the
nature,
the
quantity,
and
the
value
of
the
extracts
made,
the
purpose
and
objects
of
the
selection
or
the
selections
made,
the
effect
upon
the
copyrighted
work,
those
three
elements,
the
same
three
elements
and
i
might
add
which
chief
judge
yankwich
adapted
in
the
article
to
which
mr.
carman
referred
and
which
incidentally
was
a
critical
comment
by
judge
yankwich
upon
judge
carter's
decision
in
this
case
while
this
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now
justice
story's
comment
obviously
had
in
mind
the
english
usage
and
i
think
that
is
established
by
an
interesting
fact
among
the
very
many
times
from
which
the
passage
has
been
quoted
are
at
least
two
occasions
when
it
was
it
quoted
with
approval
by
two
different
vice-chancellors
in
england,
about
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
at
a
time
when
english
judges
were
little
aware
and
wholly
indifferent
to
what
american
courts
were
doing
as
a
rule.
actually,
the
strongest
authority
it
seems
to
be
that
can
be
cited
for
the
proposition
of
fair
use
means
what
i
have
tried
to
say
it
means
instead
of
what
mr.
carman
says
it
means
is
the
authority
judge
learned
hand
who
on
two,
at
least
two
different
occasions
in
the
second
circuit
said
this,
“the
question
in
any
case
is
whether
the
part
so
taken
is
substantial
and
therefore
not
a
fair
use
of
the
copyrighted
work.”

that
is

your
honor.
i
am
actually
reading
from
our
brief
at
page
29.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
and
then
in
the
sheldon
case
he
went
to
say
copying
might
at
times
be
a
fair
use,
but
it
is
convenient
to
define
such
a
use
by
saying
that
others
may
copy
the
theme
or
ideas,
or
the
like,
of
a
work,
though
not
its
expression.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
no
neither
of
these
were
parody.

dishonored

and
letty

both
being
based
to
some
extent
on
the
case
of

in
scotland.
well
now
if
fair
use
is
merely
the
label
as
i
have
tried
to
say
or
the
concept
of
substantial
taking
which
from
the
beginning
has
permeated
copyright
law,
there
is,
i
respectfully
submit,
no
question
left
in
the
case
where
the
finding
a
fact
that
there
was
a
substantial
taking
of
copyrightable
and
copyrightable
material
is
not
only
not
challenged,
but
is
conceded
to
be
correct
from
the
facts
and
if
fair
use
does
not
permit
anything
more
than
a
substantial
taking;
if
it
is
not
an
excuse
for
substantial
taking
then
infringement
has
been
made
up.
even
so,
if
we
take
the
three
criteria
of
mr.
justice
story
and
they
have
been
frequently
repeated
throughout
the
cases
and
assume
that
fair
use
means
something
more
that
just
the
ordinary
test
of
substantiality,
it
seems
to
me
we
must
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
which
was
reached
both
courts
below.
as
to
quantity
and
value
of
the
parts
taken
the
finding
is
dispositive,
definitive,
obsessive
with
substantial.
now
substantiality
is
not
a
mechanical
test.
it
is
a
pretty
flexible
one.
it
can
vary
with
the
nature
of
the
work
from
which
the
material
is
taken,
the
nature
of
the
work
into
which
it
is
taken,
the
nature
of
the
material
and
its
importance
in
place
in
both
works.
mr.
carman
referred
to
various
instances
which
i
gathered
he
thought
was
somewhat
shocking.
one
sequence
of
a
motion
picture
was
held
to
be
substantial.
well,
that
is
the
harold
lloyd
case,
harold
lloyd
against
universal.
one
sequence,
why,
because
the
court
said
it
was
the
core
or
the
heart
of
the
comedy
in
the
picture
around
which
all
else
revolved
and
therefore
it
was
so
important
in
the
picture
that
it
was
substantial,
even
though
it
wasn't
the
whole
picture.
three
sentences
from
a
whole
book.
well,
that
was
held
to
be
an
unfair
use.
three
sentences
on
the
effect
of
tobacco
on
the
throat,
taken
out
of
a
medical
textbook
and
quoted
in
a
cigarette
ad.
why
did
the
court
say
that
was
substantial?
because
it
represented
all
of
the
medical
treaters
substantially,
all
of
the
medical
treaters
had
to
say
about
it
and
it
was
a
very
prominent
part
of
the
advertisement
into
which
it
was
it
copied.
they
said
it
was
not
a
fairy
use.
it
is
the
chorus
of
the
popular
song
held
to
be
substantial.
well,
anyone
familiar
with
the
material
that
comes
out
of
tin
pan
alley
knows
that
a
popular
song
has
as
fixed
form
as
a
sonnet.
sixteen
bars
repeated.
it
makes
up
the
chorus
of
a
popular
song
and
it
has
gotten
so
now
that
i
don't
think
popular
musicians
even
write
an
introduction,
because
it
is
never
played.
all
you
ever
hear
is
the
chorus.
so
if
you
take
eight
bars
of
the
sixteen,
you
have
taken
at
least
half
of
the
song
and
if
you
take
sixteen
bars
you
have
taken
the
whole
song
in
popular
music,
because
that
is
the
formula,
sixteen
bars
repeated.
but
in
any
case,
any
court
has
considerable
flexibility
in
its
determination
of
what
is
or
what
is
not
substantial
or
an
important
taking.
well,
the
second
of
the
criteria
the
effect
upon
the
plaintiff's
works.
if
recognized
both
here
and
in
england
then
under
copyright
statute
such
as
exist
in
those
two
countries
proofs
of
injury
is
not
necessary.
it
is
enough
that
your
right
of
exclusion
has
been
invaded,
but
if
injury
is
necessary,
we
can
have
it
here.
the
copyright
act
gives
us
the
right
to
reproduce
this
work
in
any
manner
or
by
any
method.
that
means
we
can
remake
it,
if
we
desire.
and
by
remake
i
do
not
mean
so
simply
reprinting
the
old
prints,
but
actually
making
the
picture
over
again,
rewriting
it,
a
new
script
with
a
new
cast,
and
actually
photographing
it
all
over
again.
we
can
do
that
as
one
of
our
rights
and
for
the
period
of
the
copyright
it
is
an
exclusive
right.
we
can
remake
it
if
we
wanted
a
humorous
version.
if
we
desire
we
can
make
it
in
a
condensed
version
serious
or
comic
suitable
for
exhibition
on
television
at
either
15
or
30
minutes
periods
or
one
hour
periods.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
as
motion
pictures
photoplays
they
could
be
or
as
dramas.
now
that's
a
right
and
a
potential
market
form
which
we
have
been
forced
off.
benny's
motion
picture
program
of
his
parodies
on
motion
picture
film,
it
can
be
exhibited
and
re-exhibited
all
over
the
country
on
television.
it
can
be
exhibited
at
motion
picture
theaters.
now
remember,
concededly
it
is
composed
of
our
material.
it
is
conceded
that
in
substantial
part
is
our
material.
they
can
put
it
on
television,
the
records
show
that
on
the
average
they
estimate
that
benny
gets
about
25
million
viewers
on
any
one
night.
the
25
million
people
watching
benny
using
our
material
when
some
of
them
might
perhaps
be
in
motion
picture
theater
watching
one
of
our
pictures.
now
as
i
said
in
the
brief,
of
course,
we
have
to
suffer
competition
from
television
and
from
everyone
else,
but
why,
when
we
have
a
property
right
which
the
statute
says
is
the
exclusive,
are
we
compelled
to
suffer
that
competition
from
our
own
material,
taken
without
our
authority
and
against
our
consent.
then
the
third
of
the
criteria,
the
purpose
and
object
of
selections
made.
if
there
is
any
unanimity
on
the
doctrine
of
fair
use
both
here
and
in
england,
it
is
on
this
proposition
that
the
doctrine,
no
matter
how
liberal,
does
not
justify
one
person
simply
for
the
purpose
of
earning
a
profit
for
himself,
saving
himself
time,
expense,
and
money
by
appropriating
a
substantial
part
of
another's
copyright
material.
now
if
the
profit
motive
is
secondary
in
copyright
as
mr.
carman
has
suggested,
it
occupies
even
a
more
subordinate
position
with
respect
to
the
second
user
who
takes
our
material.
and
yet
for
what
purpose
was
this
material
taken?
and
you
cannot
differentiate
among
benny,
cvs,
or
american
in
that
respect
because
they
were
all
engaged
in
the
same
enterprise
and
that
enterprise
was
to
advertise
lucky
strike
cigarettes
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it.
they
need
this
entertainment
material
in
order
to
attract
an
audience,
because
the
commercial
is
no
good
unless
somebody
is
listening
to
it
and
they
are
not
going
to
get
an
audience
by
just
telling
them
that
the
announcer
is
going
to
come
on
and
tell
them
what
a
good
smoke
lucky
strike
is.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
entertainment
material,
a
substantial
part
of
which
concededly
they
took
from
our
copyright
picture
was
taken
in
order
to
attract
an
audience
so
that
jack
benny
and
don
wilson
could
tell
that
audience
to
smoke
lucky
strike
cigarettes.
now
that
is
a
kind
of
a
purpose
that
no
fair
use
decision
has
ever,
has
ever
countenanced.
nor
is
it
the
kind
of
a
purpose
which
would
countenance
an
ostensible
criticism
or
review
assuming
that
eautolight
ten
years
after
the
event
is
a
review
of
gaslight.
there
is
a
case
in
england
that
i
think
is
pretty
good
on
that
subject
campbell
against
scott.
the
defendant
there
had
published
what
purported
to
be
a
critical
review
of
the
poetry
and
poets
of
the
19th
century.
what
it
consisted
of
was
a
few
pages
of
an
introductory
survey
of
19th
century
poetry
and
then
a
reprint
of
a
great
deal
of
poetry
that
had
been
written
by
19th
century
poets.
it
was
in
effect
an
anthology
of
poetry,
although
put
out
under
the
guise
of
being
a
critical
assay.
well,
campbell
objected.
he
did
not
want
his
poetry
published
without
his
permission,
and
what
is,
i
suppose
just
as
important,
without
getting
compensated
for
it.
and
the
defense,
as
you
might
expect,
was
that
this
was
just
criticism,
review,
got
to
promote
through
the
arts
of
sciences
only
tried
one
of
the
little
gambit
that
dr.
baxter
introduced
into
his
testimony
here
too
that
it
was
a
compliment
to
the
plaintiff.
dr.
baxter
testified
it
is
compliment
to
a
person
to
be
parodied,
because
you
generally
did
not
parody
an
unsuccessful
work
or
an
unsuccessful
author.
well,
in
campbell
against
scott
the
defendant
said
that
they
considered
they
would
have
done
campbell
a
great
injustice
had
they
failed
to
take
notice
of
him
as
one
of
the
celebrated
poets
of
the
19th
century
and
had
reprinted
samples
of
his
work.
notwithstanding
the
english
court
had
no
difficulty
in
determining
that
that
was
not
fair
use,
but
infringement
of
copyright
and
that
the
critical
flavor
to
the
book
was
merely
a
pretext
or
a
guise.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
think
if
it
is
sought
to
be
defended
as
criticism
or
reviewed
i
think
you
have
to
ascertain
whether
it
is
in
good
faith
intended
as
such
or
whether
it
is
merely
a
cover
for
appropriating
oneself
for
one
zone
profit
to
copyright
material
of
another.
at
any
rate,
mr.
justice
black
that
was
the
approach
the
english
cases
have
taken
to
that
problem
and
the
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief.
campbell
against
scott
is
one
of
them.
there
are
several
others.
and
they
make
it
quite
clear
that
to
be
defensable
as
criticism
it
must
be
bona
fide
to
criticism
and
not
merely
a
patchwork
job
or
scissors
and
paste-pot
job
where
the
critical
flavor
is
introduced
merely
for
the
purpose
of
circumventing
the
copyright.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
unless
along
with
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
copy.
now
the
only
purpose
or
the
only
effect
of
criticism
or
review
or
parody
for
that
matter,
as
i
see
it,
is
that
it
introduces
some
elements
of
flexibility
into
the
standard
of
substantiality.
in
a
bona
fide
or
a
bona
fide
review
where
there
is
no
attempt
simply
to
get
the
free
ride
on
the
other
person's
(inaudible),
well
obviously,
has
presented
for
a
different
purpose.
you
can,
i
think,
very
well
indulge
a
more
liberal
factual
test
of
how
much
is
substantial.
and
you
can
then,
in
now
those
cases,
as
court
do,
in
these
three
tests
of
which
mr.
judge
story
referred,
they
do
not
all
have
to
go
inside,
and
you
find
a
greater
or
lesser
emphasis
on
one
or
the
other
of
them
as
the
facts
of
the
case
seem
to
be
appeal
to
the
particular
court.
but
when
the
purpose
seems
to
be
on
honest
one,
when
there
is
no
attempt
to
get
the
free
ride,
as
i
say,
courts
tend
to
look
more
closely
at
the
extent
of
injury
if
any
to
the
plaintiff
before
a
determination
of
substantiality.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
i
think
there
is
a
comparable
case
in
england
in
which
the
use
was
held
to
be
fair.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
the
case
--
i
think
it
is
scott
against
sanford,
but
i
am
not
sure
in
any
event
the
case
is
in
my
brief,
but
that
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
criticism
of
a
play
and
quite
of
bit
of
a
dialog
and
the
action
of
the
play
was
copied
into
the
critique
and
the
english
court
held
that
to
be
a
fair
use
in
circumstances
pointing
out
that
it
was
not
the
whole
play.
it
did
not
tell
the
connected
story
of
the
play,
but
there
were
excerpts
taken
to
illustrate
the
particular
points
made.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
you
cannot
--
i
do
not
know
that
you
can
lay
down
any
rule
of
thumb.
now
in
smith
against
shadow,
which
is
another
english
case
there
is
the
opposite
of
that
where
a
great
deal
was
taken
to
make
a
point
and
the
english
court
held
it
was
not
fair
use
and
that
was
the
work
called
thackeriana
where
the
author
set
out
to
prove
that
thackeray's
novels
were
autobiographical.
that
was
his
thesis
and
in
order
to
prove
his
point
he
copied
quite
a
bit
of
thackeray,
enough
so
that
the
english
court,
liberal
as
it
has
been
in
the
criticism
cases,
said
that
he
had
exceeded
the
bounds
of
fair
use.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that
is
smith
against
shadow.
that
is
also
cited
in
our
brief.
that
is
the
thackariana
case.
that
incidentally
is
one
of
the
cases
which
quoted
mr.
judge
story's
passage
in
scott
against
sanford,
there
is
another
one
of
the
cases
in
england
which
is
quoted
there.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
smith
against
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
smith
against
shadow,
the
second
of
the
two
was
the
one
that
quoted
mr.
justice
story.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
that
was
campbell
against
scott.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that
was
the
(inaudible)
poet's
case.
now
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
try
to
say
it
in
two
or
three
sentences
what
i
have
been
trying
to
say
for
the
nearly
hour
that
i
have
than
up
here.
since
it
is
conceded
that
the
kind
of
appropriation
was
made
here
would
in
the
ordinary
case
bringing
an
infringement
of
copyright,
it
must
follow
that
that
is
true
here
unless
some
special
rule
is
to
be
derived
or
devised
for
parody.
that
it
should
have
a
special
rule
that
it
is
argued
arises
from
the
necessities
of
the
art.
we
say
the
necessities
are
far
from
proved.
in
fact,
are
disproved
in
this
case,
and
in
any
event
that
is
a
question
of
policy
for
congress,
not
a
judiciary
question.
and
whether
the
fair
use
is
merely
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
substantial
taking
or
not,
whether
it
is
the
kind
of
a
doctrine
to
which
mr.
carman
referred,
the
criteria
which
test
its
application
to
any
given
set
of
fact
require
the
conclusion,
which
was
reached
here
by
the
courts
below.
for
those
reasons
we
think
the
judgment
below
be
affirmed
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
know
of
no
issues
of
fact
to
be
determined.
the
finding
of
substantiality
is
not
challenged.
if
that
isn't
enough
i
do
not
know
of
any
additional
fact.
i
must
confess,
i
cannot
follow
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
there
are
no
questions
of
fact
that
could
not
be
resolved
in
my
opinion
by
simply
a
comparison
of
two
works.
