justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
best
source
of
finding
out
measuring
the
substantial
taking?
you
have
to
look
at
the
film
or
do
you
have
to
--
you
get
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah,
but
that's,
that's
not
enough.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
you
have
an
honest-to-goodness
burlesque,
jack
benny's
plus,
do
you
recognize
then
this
any
limit
to
the
taking?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
you
tell
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
just
said,
the
number
of
parodies
is
diminished
since
the
decision
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
might
be
other
reasons?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
selvin?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
in
a
case
where
you
find
that
there
hasn't
been
a
substantial
copied?
justice
john
m.
harlan
still
you
strike
it
down
if
you
find
that
you
hold
it
is
infringement
if
you
find
that
there
is
not
a
bona
fide
use?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
one
you
were
referring
to
just
before?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
the
first
case
you
gave
an
answer
to
justice
frankfurter.
you
have
given
us
two
opposite
sides
of
the
coin,
what
is
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
one
before
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
assuming
we
should
disagreed
with
you,
what
about
the
question
is
to
where
the
case
should
go
back,
would
you
think
that
there
are
issues
of
fact
then
would
have
to
be
determined
or
whether
the
case
can
be
disposed
off
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
follow
substantiality
or
fair
use
that
the
--
that
is
too
strict
a
standard
of
the
substantiality
had
been
applied,
would
there
then
questions
of
fact,
because
there
ought
to
be
â€“
the
case
ought
to
be
sent
back
for
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
films
are
up
here,
i
think.
