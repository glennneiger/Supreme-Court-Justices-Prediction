mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
if
the
court
please.
we
will
if
time
permits
get
to
the
icc
aspect
of
the
case,
which
i
don't
think
is
actually
involved
in
this
case,
but
which
has
been
brought
in
later
on
in
the
day.
first,
in
respect
to
the
board's
statement
of
the
facts,
i
think
there's
one
or
two
things
which
should
be
added.
first,
it
must
be
deemed
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
the
particular
hot
cargo
or
struck
goods
clause,
as
we
prefer
to
call
it,
was
entered
into
freely
between
the
carriers
here
and
the
union
for
valid
or
mutual
considerations
of
some
sort
in
the
give
and
take
collective
bargaining
that
the
union
merely
requested
first
members
to
take
advantage
of
the
terms
of
the
clause
that
did
not
coerce
them
into
refusing
to
handle
the
goods
under
the
clause.
and
finally
that
at
least
one
of
the
said
carriers
that's
involved
in
this
--
that
are
involved
in
this
case
leeway
was
perfectly
willing
to
have
his
employees
not
unload
the
american
iron
freight
when
it
came
to
the
dock
and
made
no
request
that
they
not
unload
it.
in
other
words,
he
was
willing
to
comply
completely
with
the
contract
and
not
repudiate
it.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
in
--
in
trying
to
find
out
just
what
the
congress
thought
of
this
hot
cargo
or
struck
goods
agreements
to
know
a
little
bit
about
the
--
their
nature
and
their
purpose.
and
we
have
submitted
for
the
court's
examination
a
so-called
economic
--
economic
brief
which
does
set
forth
at
some
length
the
function
of
these
agreements,
their
widespread
use
not
only
with
the
--
in
the
trucking
industry,
but
in
other
areas
and
in
addition,
the
aflcio
as
amicus
has
filed
a
brief
which
in
addition
to
going
into
the
legislative
history,
deals
with
further
--
with
a
further
economic
inquiry
into
the
scope
and
purpose
of
the
so-called
unfair
goods
or
hot
cargo
goods
agreements
and
industries
other
than
transportation.
and
it's
--
you
will
see
there
that
these
agreements
have
our
--
our
traditional
labor
agreement
just
like
the
union
shall.
it's
an
important
part
of
the
whole
fabric
of
union
protection
and
the
union
weapon
in
their
dealings
with
employers
and
in
their
--
taking
their
part
from
the
economic
life
of
the
country.
there's
nothing
invidious
about
these
agreements.
they
have
many,
many
constructive
purposes.
they
are
used
widely
in
all
industries,
in
many
industries
and
they
have
been
used
traditionally
for
many,
many
years.
the
relevance
of
that
in
connection
with
congress,
whether
congress
could
possibly,
but
intended
to
outlaw
these
agreements
without
even
discussing
them
in
the
legislative
debates.
i
will
discuss
it
little
later
on.
employers
--
employers
enter
into
these
agreements
for
many
reasons
as
the
board
itself
has
pointed
out
in
earlier
briefs
that
it
is
filed
in
the
circuit
court.
employers
may
desire
to
assist
the
union
in
order
to
eliminate
cut-rate
wave's
condition
in
the
competing
plants.
that
is
a
benefit
then
for
the
employer
to
agree
that
his
employees
don't
have
to
assist
in
the
strike
at
that
cut-rate
plant
or
the
employer
may
as
often
happens
gain
some
sort
of
a
specific
confession
in
the
bargaining
process
in
return
for
which
he
gives
this
hot
cargo
or
struck
clause
agreement,
or
he
may
desire
to
maintain
harmony
in
the
plants
or
finally,
he
may
just
do
plain
in
sympathy
with
the
union's
position
in
the
strike
and
agrees
that
his
employees
don't
have
to
act
in
any
sort
of
strike
breaking
passage.
for
the
union,
the
hot
goods
clause
as
in
struck
goods
clause
has
traditionally
represented
a
formalization
of
their
basic
--
the
basic
concept
of
the
entire
labor
movement,
namely
the
concept
of
mutual
aid
and
assistance
that
working
people
in
unions
strive
wherever
possible
to
assist
each
other
in
their
labor
disputes
and
try
not
to
act
adversely
against
other
unions
engaged
in
a
strike
situation.
and
so,
these
clauses
have
been
traditionally
bargained
for
and
are
presently
contained
in
agreements,
the
length
and
press
of
this
nation.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
some
do
and
some
don't.
that's
a
make
way
to
--
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
either
the
clause
is
legal
or
illegal.
in
this
particular
case,
i
don't
know
who
drew
this
particular
clause,
but
that's
a
make
way
that's
put
into
some
union
security
clauses
which
they
may
be
adopt,
but
it
and
itself
doesn't
determine
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
clause
naturally.
most
clauses
don't
have
that
for
what
its
worth.
this
clause
also,
i
might
point
out
goes
a
little
bit
further
than
other
clauses
and
says
that
the
employees
shall
not
be
allowed
usually
because
they
shall
not
be
required
to
handle
struck
goods.
this
clause
says
that
they
shall
not
be
allowed
to
handle
unfair
or
struck
goods,
which
is
relevant
in
connection
with
whether
this
is
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
the
history
of
this
--
of
the
litigation
of
the
validity
or
enforceability
of
the
hot
cargo/struck
goods
clause
before
the
board
who's
very
little
up
until
1952,
the
board
was
pretty
unanimous
in
saying
that
these
clauses
are
legal
and
enforceable,
both.
since
1952,
beginning
of
1953,
no
two
members
of
the
board
have
been
able
to
agree
on
any
aspect
of
either
validity
or
enforceability
of
these
clauses,
so
that
you'll
see
all
of
the
board's
opinions
dealing,
which
they
changed
the
position
as
new
members
are
appointed.
all
of
these
opinions
are
--
are
contained
in
two
and
sometimes
three
separate
--
sometimes
four
separate
concurring
or
dissenting
opinions
by
the
various
board
members.
and
it's
a
very
--
i
suppose
that
one
thing
that
is
proved
by
these
history
of
litigation
before
the
--
before
the
board
anyway
is
that
we
certainly
haven't
got
any
question
of
administrative
expertise
here
that
this
court
have
to
be
concerned
about
setting
some
fields
or
technically
train
consideration
or
view
of
the
hot
cargo
problem.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
we
have
here
a
simply
problem
of
construction
of
an
act
of
congress
but
the
words
--
what
the
words
means,
what
was
congress'
intent
for
all
we
have
here.
so
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
with
what
the
board
as
a
body
of
experts
might
consider
because
as
i
said,
no
two
of
them
agree
on
anything.
now,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
we
have
injected
here
at
least
to
the
--
pretty
strongly
in
the
board's
brief,
although
not
so
strongly
in
board
argument,
oral
argument,
the
question
of
the
legality
of
hot
cargo
or
struck
goods
clause
as
such.
that
is
whether
the
mere
making
of
such
a
clause
or
the
clause
after
it
made
is
in
itself
an
illegal
clause
for
some
reason
or
they're
under
taft-hartley
for
federal
public
policy
because
it
was
prohibited
by
the
language
or
whatnot.
that
is
not
part
of
this
particular
case,
because
as
what's
pointed
out
by
counsel
for
the
board,
mr.
manoli,
the
board
here,
all
four
--
four
of
the
five
members
either
stated
or
assumed
that
the
clauses
in
this
case
were
legal
and
merely
then
went
on
to
hold
for
various
reasons
or
three
of
the
members
went
on
to
hold
for
various
reasons
--
two
of
the
members
only
went
on
to
hold
for
their
reasons
that
the
clauses
were
not
enforceable
for
the
reasons
stated
by
mr.
manoli
and
the
third
member
said
that
the
clauses
as
he
has
consistently
said,
mr.
rogers
said
that
the
clauses
are
against
public
policies
as
expressed
in
the
act
and
are
therefore
unenforceable
for
that
reason
and
not
the
reason
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
closest
i
suppose
is
the
union
--
it's
a
closed
shop
or
union
shop
clause
and
that's
done
rather
indirectly.
it's
not
done
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
in
so
many
words,
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
some
language
of
the
act
or
some
purpose
of
the
act.
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
not
yet.
we
may
come
to
that
when
we
have
other
board
members,
but
as
of
yet,
there's
only
one
board
member
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
this
case
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
not
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but,
i
think
at
least
to
a
degree
that
the
legality
issue
is
implicit
here
for
the
reason
that
all
of
the
or
that
the
basic
prepositional
premise
on
which
the
board
basis
this
argument
of
unenforceability
is
the
same
premise,
the
same
proposition
which
is
used
to
argue
that
the
clause
is
illegal
in
itself.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
a
premise
pointed
out
by
justice
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
are
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
are
of
course
many
in
this
country.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
that
as
we
--
as
i
will
show
that
it's
not
our
case
because
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
the
execution
or
enforcement
is
not
contrary.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
correct.
but
that's
not
our
--
our
case
here.
as
pointed
up
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
board's
basic
premise
in
this
entire
argument
here
and
unless
that
premise
supported
this
case
as
mr.
manoli
very
honestly
admitted,
but
that
premise
that
supported
this
case
got
collapsed,
is
that
congress
intended
not
to
protect
under
8
(b)
4,
not
just
to
protect
the
innocent
third
party
neutral
who
is
being
struck
in
an
effort
to
get
him
to
cease
dealing
with
the
primary
employer
that's
engaged
in
the
labor
dispute
or
strike
somewhere
else
in
which
neutral
has
no
power
to
do
anything
about
the
dispute.
he
couldn't
settle
the
dispute,
the
primary
dispute.
it
was
not
congress'
intention
merely
to
protect
that
individual
against
this
course
of
strikes
which
is
the
traditional
secondary
boycott.
but
also,
congress
intended
and
by
its
language
sought
to
protect
the
--
any
person,
now
that
it
goes
with
that
part,
any
person
who
might
be
affected
by
the
refusal
to
handle
which
is
carried
on
by
the
so-called
innocent
third
party
neutral.
in
other
words,
the
primary
employer
as
stated
by
the
board,
who
is
actually
engaged
in
a
primary
dispute,
the
board
says
that
he's
being
protected
somehow.
the
board
says
apparently
the
customers,
consumers,
any
--
i
don't
know
where
the
language
is
drawn.
the
board
hasn't
attempted
to
draw
a
line,
but
apparently
anyone
who
is
affected
by
that
secondary
strike
or
that
secondary
boycott
against
the
neutral
is
being
--
the
congress
has
sought
to
protect.
and
in
that
premise,
it
argues
of
course
the
invalidity
of
the
hot
cargo
as
such
as
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
act
and
its
unenforceability
because
enforcing
it
would
result
in
hurting
these
third--
third
parties.
and
also,
the
board
argues
from
the
same
premise
for
an
expanded
interpretation
of
the
language,
of
the
literal
language
of
8
(b)
(4),
in
a
matter
which
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
in
a
matter
which
i
will
get
to
shortly.
so
the
whole
case
here
will
rise
and
fall
on
whether
either
the
language
of
the
act
or
its
legislative
history
demonstrates
inclusively
that
congress
did
intend
to
protect
not
just
the
third
party
neutral,
but
everyone
that
might
be
affected
by
--
by
this
action
taken
against
them.
let's
see
what
the
language
says
first.
so
the
language
is
set
forth
--
on
what
page
the
board
--
page
two
of
the
board's
brief,
the
language
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
is
pretty
narrowly
drawn.
to
examine
it,
what
it
does
is
--
is
prescribe
first
of
all
the
union
activity,
not
employer
activity.
it
doesn't
reach
any
employer
activity
no
matter
what
its
impact
may
be
elsewhere.it
only
reaches
activities
of
unions.
it
only
reaches
a
certain
type
of
activity
of
unions,
namely
a
strike
or
an
inducement
to
strike.
now,
what
--
what
is
meant
by
the
term
concerted
--
concerted
refusal,
we'll
come
to
shortly.
we
say
it
means
a
partial
strike.
it
was
meant
to
embrace
a
partial
strike,
what
you
do
have
in
this
refusal
to
handle
case,
the
refusal
to
handle
only
a
particular
product,
not
all
products
with
a
prospect.
but
at
anyway,
it
prohibits
only
a
union
from
engaging
number
two
in
a
strike
or
inducing
a
strike.
and
three,
for
the
purpose
of
forcing,
and
the
word
forcing
is
important,
of
enforcing
any
employer
of
the
term
or
other
person
to
cease
dealing
with
someone
else.
now,
that
is
pretty
narrow
language
if
congress
actually
intended
to
give
the
broad
protections
which
are
contended
for
by
the
board.
for
instance,
they
could
have
said
after
the
words
"any
employer"
in
the
a
part
of
our
page
2
there,
any
employer
or
other
person
or
any
other
employer
or
other
person.
what
is
meant
by
term
other
person,
we'll
come
to
shortly.
that
was
not
done.
the
struck
good
or
hot
cargo
agreement
as
such
was
not
outlawed
in
so
many
words
as
congress
very
easily
could
have
done.
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
no
clause
--
no
contract
as
such
has
been
specifically
outlawed,
but
it's
significant
that
when
they
came
to
the
closed
shop
or
union
shop,
it
was
said
that
at
least
pretty
directly,
not
in
so
many
words,
but
in
unmistakable
language
which
it
had
to
include
the
union
shop
agreement.
that's
section
8
(a)
(3).
congress
--
congress
didn't
even
do
that.
the
phrase
"other
persons"
is
what
the
board
hang
its
head
on
primarily,
the
other
phrase
other
person.
the
court
below
in
the
second
circuit
(inaudible)
and
the
board
prior
to
this
board
in
past
years
has
construed
that
term
to
mean
persons
who
don't
come
under
the
definition
of
an
employer
under
the
act,
which
means
that
they
would
have
to
have
someone
under
their
hire
and
thus,
it
embraces
sole
proprietors
or
persons
like
that
who
are
often
secondarily
boycott,
but
who
may
not
have
employees
and
because
they
don't
have
employees
may
not
achieve
the
protection
which
congress
sought
to
give
all
innocent
third
party
neutrals,
whether
they
were
actual
employers
or
employees
or
not.
that
is
what
--
what
the
earlier
board
construed
this
section
and
how
the
court
below
has
construed
it
and
we
think
it's
perfectly
reasonable
and
sensible
construction.
the
legislative
history
is
not
put
on
this
at
all.
it
says
nothing
about
what
other
person
for
that
particular
language
was
intended
to
cover.
but
i
think
we
should
bear
this
in
mind,
surely
the
evil
of
the
secondary
boycott
lies
not
in
its
impact
on
other
person
or
on
third
--
remote
third
parties,
but
on
the
pressure
puts
on
an
innocent
neutral.
because
if
the
real
evil
is
the
effect
on
third
parties,
consumers,
the
general
public
and
so
on,
then
any
economic
action
by
union,
a
strike,
a
straight
strike
which
had
wide
fold
impacts
often,
depending
upon
the
severity
of
the
strike,
that
strike
should
be
outlawed
too.
congress,
of
course,
has
not
done
that.
so
it's
simply
isn't
consistent
or
logical
to
say
that
congress
must
have
been
concerned
with
all
of
these
remote
third
parties
or
that
the
evil
of
the
secondary
boycott
anymore
than
the
evil
of
any
other
strike
action
or
economic
action
by
the
union,
lies
in
its
impact
upon
remote
third
parties
as
distinguished
from
the
immediate
--
immediately
struck
innocent
third
party
neutral.
now,
getting
to
the
legislative
history,
i
think
the
most
striking
feature
of
that
history
is
this,
that
although
the
hot
cargo
or
struck
goods
clause
is
in
a
traditional
feature
of
union
--
a
traditional
matter
which
union
is
surviving
for
many,
many
years
preceding
even
the
wagner
act
and
a
law
they
were
in
widespread
used
as
pointed
out
by
board
and
as
we
point
out
by
the
time
taft-hartley
was
being
considered
in
1947,
1946,
there's
not
a
single
mentioned
by
any
of
the
legislators,
any
of
the
congressmen
or
senators
or
any
of
the
reports
of
the
hot
cargo
agreement
as
such
or
the
struck
clause
agreement
as
such,
no
statement
even
that
we
intend
by
it
be
forced
to
outlaw
the
struck
goods
agreements
which
are
so
widely
used
and
so
on
which
would
normally
you
think
appear
there
if
was
a
congressional
purpose
actually
to
outlaw
or
to
limit
the
enforceability
of
these
agreements.
but
there
simply
is
nothing
the
legislative
history
on
the
hot
cargo
agreement
as
such
expressed
by
the
legislatures.
now,
there
is
some
testimony
of
course
by
employer
witnesses
who
protest
the
hot
cargo
clause,
but
that
type
of
testimony
is
evidence
of
legislative
intent,
then
i
don't
know
any
union
activity
that
you
couldn't
find
a
basis
for
prescription
under
taft-hartley
act.
the
legislative
history
is
set
forth
at
some
short
length
in
our
brief,
in
longer
length
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
aflcio,
which
i
will
read,
the
amicus
brief.
that
legislative
history
shows
conclusively
this,
that
in
addition
not
to
even
--
in
addition
not
even
to
having
taken
off
and
debated,
argued
about
the
hot
cargo
situation
as
such.
the
actual
discussion
when
they
were
talking
about
secondary
boycotts,
all
was
centered
around
the
strike
that
is
directed
against
some
innocent
third
party
neutral
who
has
nothing
to
do
anything
about
the
primary
strike
that
is
drawn
in.
all
the
discussions
referred
to
those
to
two
aspects.
first
a
strike,
the
congress
was
--
was
very
much
--
i
won't
say
horrified,
but
they
were
very
much
impressed
with
the
evil
of
an
innocent
party
being
subjected
to
a
strike
number
one
and
number
two,
being
forced
against
his
will
to
give
up
business
dealings
with
someone
else.
that
is
what
congress
was
talking
about
all
through
these
rather
general
references
to
secondary
boycott,
determine
itself
to
mean
a
thousand
things
as
both
of
our
briefs
point
out.
but
the
actual
discussion
centered
around
the
strike
situation
and
against
a
particular
neutral.
there
was
not
talk
about
the
public
generally
or
other
third
parties
other
than
the
neutral,
except
in
a
very
limited
way,
in
a
very
incidental
way.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
--
one
answer
for
that
is
that
congress
shy
away
from
the
practice
of
giving
any
nongovernmental
party,
any
private
party
the
right
to
go
into
court
for
an
injunction
in
the
light
of
our
unsavory
past
experience
with
the
private
use
of
injunctions
in
labor
dispute
in
the
federal
courts.
i
suppose
i
find
it
in
the
principal
reason.
that
was
--
what
actually
was
done
was
that
the
right
of
injunction
was
given
only
to
the
board
and
to
no
other
private
party,
the
third
party
or
the
neutral
or
the
primary
party
for
that
matter.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
we're
--
it
is
(inaudible)
progressing.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
i'm
not
sure.
so,
this
entire
lack
of
discussion
and
arguments
about
the
hot
cargo
clause
as
such
and
the
limitation
of
the
discussion
to
the
evil
of
a
neutral
being
heard
indicates
we
say
and
you'll
read
the
numerous
excerpts
there,
i
think
you
will
agree.
indicate
that
congress
intended
actually
to
get
out
to
protect
only
that
innocent
third
party
neutral.
that's
a
traditional
concept
of
a
--
of
a
secondary
boycott,
that
a
fourth
or
third
party
out
here
that
has
no
interest
in
the
dispute
is
being
attacked
by
a
strike
or
something.
and
the
--
the
sympathy
goes
to
him
and
congress,
legislated
to
protect
him
and
it
did.
but
it
didn't
seek
anymore
than
it's
out
in
the
primary
strike
situation
to
protect
all
persons
who
might
be
affected.
now,
even
more
revealing
than
what
congress
said
in
the
debates
and
whatnot
or
what
its
language
says,
i
think
is
what
congress
has
specifically
refrained
from
doing.
first
of
all,
it
refrained
in
the
house
version
of
the
bill,
the
plan
became
8
(b)
(4),
to
outlaw
threats
against
--
threats
of
strike
action
against
the
neutral.
there
was
only
actual
strikes
against
the
neutral
which
were
outlawed.
so
that,
therefore,
the
law
is
today
held
by
many
circuits
that
a
union
has
a
right
to
threaten
a
neutral
with
a
strike
in
order
to
force
that
neutral
not
to
do
business
with
someone
else.
that's
perfectly
--
perfectly
permissible
today
and
the
board
grants
it.
congress
failed
to
outlaw
that
type
of
threat
which
certainly
doesn't
indicate
any
great
concern
for
the
public.
the
second
and
more
important,
if
refused
specifically
to
pass
specific
legislation
introduced
in
the
83rd
and
84th
congress
designed
to
outlaw
the
hot
cargo
or
struck
goods
agreement
in
so
many
words.
senator
schoeppel
in
19
--
in
the
83rd
congress
and
senator
curtis
in
the
congress
before
the
present
one,
introduced
bills
and
argued
strongly
against
the
evils
and
so-called
or
they
can
see
them
of
hot
cargo
agreements,
but
these
bills
were
rejected.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
they're
in
page
--
page
19
of
our
brief
and
it
referred
to
in
the
brief
of
the
aflcio
somewhere.
that
under
many
rulings
of
this
court,
the
international
boxing
club
is
one
of
them,
others
set
forth
in
our
brief.
it's
a
pretty
strong
indication
that
congress
couldn't
have
been
so
worried
about
these
protections
of
third
parties
that
might
be
affected
or
even
about
the
outlawing
of
the
hot
cargo
agreement
itself.
in
addition
to
all
that,
these
questions
can
--
the
board
hasn't
yet
answered.
if
congress
was
so
concerned
with
the
public,
the
general
public
or
third
parties
who
might
be
affected
and
not
just
the
direct
innocent
third
party
neutral
that
they
were
so
concerned,
that
congress
was
so
concerned
with
that
that
the
board
argues.
why
didn't
it
outlaw
consumer
boycotts
of
the
innocent
third
parties?
those
are
perfectly
legal
under
taft-hartley.
why
didn't
it
outlaw
the
voluntary
action
of
a
neutral
in
refusing
to
deal
with
someone
else
which
has
impacts
--
which
might
have
the
same
exact
impacts
as
an
involuntary
refusal
as
far
as
third
parties
are
concerned?why
did
congress
in
8
(b)
(4)
permit
even
direct
strikes
against
neutrals
in
the
situation
where
they
were
trying
to
get
to
the
neutral
to
bring
pressure
on
the
primary
employer
who
has
refused
to
recognize
a
certified
union.
that
of
course
has
the
same
impacts
on
the
public.
why
did
congress
permit
employee
--
permit
union
and
employers
to
write
clauses
in
their
agreements
which
would
permit
--
which
would
--
which
would
prevent
the
employer
from
requiring
his
employee's
to
cross
picket
line.
the
board
--
the
8
(b)
(4)
or
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(4)
does
that
and
this
court
in
the
rockaway
news
case
that's
set
forth
--
mentioned
in
our
brief
specifically
said
that
this
type
of
agreement
which
is
closely
akin
to
the
struck
goods
agree
--
agreement
are
perfectly
valid.
and
finally,
what
are
we
gonna
do
about
the
anomalus
situation
that's
created
under
the
301
when
the
union
seeks
--
when
an
employer
refuses
and
the
board
says,
"we
have
no
right
to
go
to
our
employees
and
say
refuse
to
comply
with
the
hot
cargo
clause."
and
the
board
says,
"we
can't
go
to
our
employees
and
tell
them
to
comply
with
the
clause."
then
we
go
into
court
and
seek
specific
enforcement
under
--
under
301,
section
301.
the
board
in
its
own
brief
suggested
that
that
is
a
possible
remedy
when
we
said,
"what
happened
to
our
contract?"
the
board
says,
"well,
one
of
your
remedies
is
to
go
to
court."
supposing
we
got
our
specific
performance,
of
course,
the
impact
on
third
parties
is
exactly
the
same
as
in
our
--
in
the
first
instance
the
employees
had
refused
to
handle.
so
again,
this
whole
business
of
--
in
attempt,
object
to
protect
parties,
third
parties
indirectly
affected
parties
other
than
the
immediately
struck
neutral,
we
say
is
simply
without
support
in
the
language
of
the
act,
its
legislative
history
and
logic
and
common
sense
or
any
other
premise.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
--
with
our
agreement.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i'd
say
it's
(inaudible)
i'd
say
--
i
mean,
assuming
the
board
is
right
that
we
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
either
congress
intended
to
protect
other
than
that
third
party
neutral
and
as
in
effect,
either
outlawed
the
hot
cargo
clause
or
at
least
denied
enforcement
by
the
union
or
it
didn't.
now,
if
it
didn't
as
we
contend,
then
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
enforce
and
to
make
these
clauses.
i
mean,
congress
has
got
to
--
this
court
will
have
to
decide
that
congress
intended
one
or
the
other
and
if
it
--
if
it
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right.
and
it
simply
points
the
protection
to
third
party
neutral
on
its
face
and
therefore
since
we're
not
what
we
agree
with
that,
we
are
free
to
make
and
enforce
these
agreements.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
then
it's
up
to
this
court
put
the
proper
construction
on
it.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
don't
think
it
would
get
much
better
to
administrative
expertise
in
this
situation.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you
can
go
to
any
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
except
we
have
here
primarily
a
question
of
statutory
construction
which
is
the
job
of
the
courts
more
than
the
job
of
the
board.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
either
which
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i
--
if
i
meant
to
comply
that
there
could
be
possible
basis
for
the
board's
argument
here.
i'll
withdraw
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
we
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
we
say
pretty
clearly
here,
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
do
have
to
refer
to
administrative
expertise
where
you
do
have
to
fulfill
a
court's
function
of
determining
what
the
meaning
of
the
act
is,
what
the
congressional
purpose
was,
which
is
the
function
of
this
court
and
not
the
board,
or
at
least
the
board's
conclusions
are
not
entitled
to
a
greater
weight.
now,
let's
--
so
much
for
the
general
--
what
the
general
congressional
purpose
was
or
should
be
considered
in
this
case.
let's
apply
the
language
of
8
(b)
(4)
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
see
how
we
come
out.
the
board
has
argued
for
the
way
they
expanded
reading
of
8
(b)
(4)
under
which
any
union
inducements,
whether
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
strike
or
not
of
its
members
to
refuse
to
handle
trades,
is
a
literal
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4).
and
it
reaches
--
it
argues
for
this
expanded
reading
on
the
assumption
that
is
the
congressional
purpose
to
protect
third
parties
other
than
the
neutral.
because
if
you
didn't
--
because
in
order
to
achieve
that
purpose,
you've
got
to
read
--
to
read
the
8
(b)
(4)
in
the
expanded
fashion
that
argues.
now,
and
it
says
therefore
that
even
--
that
even
though
the
employer
repudiates
the
agreement,
still,
the
union
can
enforce,
and
that
is
this
case.
let's
consider
first
the
implications
of
that
argument.
apparently,
the
board
would
permit
and
in
fact
encourage
employers
to
repudiate
valid
commitments
that
are
made
in
the
give
and
take
of
collective
bargaining
where
concessions
are
made
back
and
forth.
we
know
that
these
agreements
aren't
reached
in
a
day.
each
clause
represents
a
concession
from
one
side
or
the
other
that
the
employer
has
the
right
to
repudiate
these
agreements
and
go
gus
merry
way
leaving
the
unions
and
whatever
other
remedies
it
might
have,
which
it
--
which
at
best
are
impractical
as
suggested
by
the
board.
it
does
this
in
the
face
of
a
specific
policy
in
the
act
to
encourage
the
making
of
collective
agreements
and
to
protect
these
agreements
when
made
and
to
provide
means
for
the
enforcement
of
these
agreements.
the
whole
bend
of
the
act
is
towards
encouraging
unions
and
employers
to
get
together
and
make
collective
agreements
in
each
of
the
acceptable
terms
and
then
to
see
to
it
that
these
collective
agreements
are
enforced,
to
say
it
at
least,
it's
shocking
to
hear
anyone
suggest
that
a
party
is
free
to
repudiate
an
agreement
solemnly
made
for
good
considerations
and
we
don't
know
how
we
can
assume
a
very
valuable
considerations
here.
it's
even
more
shocking
for
the
labor
board
as
the
guardian
of
the
labor
management
relations
to
make
that
suggestion
in
the
labor
management
field
where
if
anywhere
it's
applied
over
the
mutual
promises
be
--
of
the
parties
be
respected.
the
court
below
was
shocked
with
this
--
with
this
position
of
the
board,
the
second
circuit
in
(inaudible)
was
and
for
the
centers
murdock
peterson
were
much
shocked.
but
aside
from
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
in
the
same
(inaudible)
the
same
expressions
of
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
your
honor.
aside
from
that
--
the
affects
of
the
board's
argument,
we
submit
that
none
of
the
elements,
none
of
the
four
elements
which
go
to
make
an
8
(b)
(4)
violation
are
present
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
first
of
all,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
requires
that
the
union
has
engaged
in
a
strike
or
an
inducement
to
strike
or
--
or
engaged
in
a
concerted
refusal
to
do
work.
now,
obviously,
we
have
not
a
strike
situation
here
when
the
employer
has
consented
in
advance
that
not
only
shall
not
the
employees
be
required
to
handle
american
iron
freight,
but
they
shall
not
be
allowed
to.
the
board
doesn't
argue
that
we
haven't
got
--
that
that
element
is
not
here.
we
haven't
got
a
strike.
the
union
has
not
induced
a
strike
in
this
case.
the
board
says,
however,
we
have
induced
some
sort
of
a
literal
concerted
refusal
going
out
and
taking
the
word
refusal
in
its
very
literal
sense.
well,
now,
we
state
and
it's
been
--
it's
found
support
in
prior
decisions
of
the
board
here
and
in
the
decisions
of
the
second
circuit
in
(inaudible)
and
the
court
below
that
the
term
concerted
refusal
was
used
by
congress
to
include
something
which
might
be
less
than
a
strike
as
commonly
understood,
a
partial
strike,
and
was
used
to
--
in
order
to
get
at
this
very
situation
here
where
in
the
absence
of
a
--
of
a
hot
cargo
agreement,
employees
may
--
or
union
may
go
to
a
employer,
a
neutral
third
party
neutral
and
order
those
employees
of
that
third
party
neutral
not
to
handle
just
a
particular
--
a
piece
of
freight
that
came
in
whereas,
during
the
rest
of
the
day,
they
were
free
to
work.
now,
maybe
that
wouldn't
constitute
a
strike,
like
in
the
present
case
of
which
we
have
no
hot
cargo
agreement
here
at
all
or
no
struck
goods
agreement
and
the
union
had
forced
its
employees
--
had
told
its
employees,
its
members
there,
"don't
handle
american
iron
freight,
but
handle
all
the
rest
of
the
freight
that
comes
in,
or
else
when
american
iron
freight
comes
in,
go
do
something
else."
in
other
words,
work
all
day
long
so
you
don't
engage
in
a
strike,
but
don't
handle
american
iron
freight.
now,
that
situation
wasn't
perhaps
embraced
by
the
word
strike,
so
congress
used
the
phrase
concerted
refusal
to
handle
--
to
take
care
of
that
very
situation
and
not
all
of
it.
it
cannot
mean
any
literal
refusal
to
handle
except
on
the
premise
of
the
board
that
you're
out
to
protect
the
entire
--
all
members
of
the
public,
not
just
the
neutral.
there
could
be
no
refusal
or
partial
refusal
or
partial
strike
here,
which
involves
the
element
of
insubordination
when
the
employer
as
here
has
consented
in
advance
to
this
very
activity,
and
it's
actually
stated
that
the
employees
shall
not
be
allowed
to
handle
american
iron
freight
when
it
appears
(inaudible)
so
there
is
no
--
that
first
element
is
simply
added
in
this
case.
the
second
element
is
that
the
refusal
to
handle
had
to
be
done
in
the
course
of
the
employee's
employment.
the
word
in
the
course
of
employment,
the
phrase
is
used
in
8
(b)
(4).
we
say
that
means
and
it
must
mean
this
that
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
any
strike
or
insubordination
or
disobedience
of
orders
to
work
made
by
the
employer
was
a
proper
order,
namely
was
one
made
in
the
course
of
the
employees
employment
and
the
board
put
this
phrase
in,
which
it
did.
the
board
prior
to
1952
construed
the
phrase
course
of
employment
to
mean
just
that
and
it
meant
just
that.
the
second
circuit
since
the
conway
case
way
back
in
1949
--
since
1949,
the
circuit
court
considered
the
problem
--
have
adopted
that
meaning
of
the
word
course
of
employment
other
than
the
ninth
circuit.
the
board
says
--
this
phrase
and
course
of
employment
was
to
--
was
meant
to
make
clear
that
they
didn't
want
to
get
after
boycotting
activities
of
employees,
done
by
employees
in
their
capacity
as
consumers,
but
that
would
be
superpose
the
purpose
the
act
merely
interdicts
employees
from
doing
something.
and
if
they
aren't
employees,
then
no
need
to
worry
about
what
to
do
in
their
consumers.
so
we
say
the
only
logical
meaning
to
the
phrase
in
the
course
of
employment
was
to
tighten
down
what
acts
of
disobedience
to
orders
meant.
here,
of
course,
the
work
of
handling
american
iron
freight
was
not
part
of
the
employments,
duties
of
the
particular
employees
here
because
it
has
been
specifically
taken
out.
in
fact,
the
clause
said
that
employees
shall
not
be
allowed
much
stronger
than
to
not
be
required,
shall
not
be
allowed
to
handle
american
iron
freight.
therefore,
we
insist
that
the
second
elements
of
an
8
(b)
(4)
violation
does
not
exist
here.
i
may
point
out
that
the
board's
insistence
that
the
parties
do
not
have
a
right
to
try
to
define
their
own
terms
of
employment,
which
is
traditionally
done
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
applies
directly
to
the
face
of
this
court's
admonition
to
the
board
in
the
american
insurance
case
where
it
says
it's
none
of
the
board's
business,
what
the
--
what
the
substantive
terms
of
the
agreement
are
and
particularly
the
scope
of
the
employment's
relationship,
which
was
involved
in
that
case.
it's
traditional
for
union,
for
instance,
to
put
in
their
contracts.
employers
do
agree
that
foremen
can't
do
the
work
of
non-supervisory
employees
or
vice
versa
or
in
the
case
of
female
employees,
they
don't
have
to
do
certain
types
of
heavy
work.
now,
certainly,
that
sort
of
opposes
in
the
contract
and
the
union
told
its
members
to
observe
it
that
would
never
consider
the
secondary
boycott,
and
we
have
the
same
type
of
clause
here.
for
instance,
in
this
very
case
here,
one
of
the
freight
that
came
up
from
american
iron
was
this
little
light
packages,
and
the
employer
told
its
office
personnel,
girls
or
otherwise
who
were
represented
by
some
other
union
to
go
ahead
and
unload
that
--
those
packages
because
our
dock
people
won't
and
the
union
told
them
not
to
unload,
their
union,
the
office
workers
union
told
them
not
to
unload.
that
would
be
considered
to
be
a
violation,
clearly
not
because
that
is
not
worth
that
in
the
course
of
the
employment
of
those
office
workers.
and
in
our
case,
it
simply
is
not
part
of
the
employments
relationship
or
the
usual
expected
job
of
the
dock
hence
that
they
unload
struck
goods.
spelled
out
long
in
advance
of
any
strike,
long
in
advance
of
any
labor
difficulties
and
clearly
understood
by
both
parties.
that
they
--
when
that
situation
arose,
their
job
did
not
require
them
to
unload
that
particular
freight.
the
third
element
of
an
8
(b)
(4)
violation
is
that
the
strike
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
and
the
union
attempted
to
induce?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
told
the
office
people.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
if
the
employer
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
that's
right
if
the
employer
urged
of
that
action.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
employer.
and
that
would
of
course
result
in
not
handling
those
goods
and
would
have
all
the
third
party
impact
that
the
board
says
congress
is
worried
about.
but
that's
legal.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
what
if
employer
insisted?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
and
what
if
the
employer
insisted?
for
instance,
insisted
that
the
office
shall
unload
these
goods.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
not
that
the
employer
insisted.
unless
he
want
to
condone
breaches
of
employer's
commitment.
that's
something
else.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
has
no
commitment.
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
the
employers
don't
have
on
his
own.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
which
will
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
if
he's
been
forced
to
do
it,
that's
one
thing.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
which
is
--
which
is
something
we
have
not
get
here.
where
the
employer
has
agreed
in
advance,
how
can
you
say
that
he's
been
enforced?
how
is
the
requirement
which
this
court
say
when
they
first
consider
8
(b)
(4)
in
denver
billing
trade
that
8
(b)
(4)
is
meant
to
--
is
meant
to
prohibit
strikes
which
have
the
purpose
of
forcing
a
third
party
to
stop
dealing
with
someone
else.
the
word
forcing
is
used
by
this
court.
what
forcing
have
we
hear
when
the
employer
has
agreed
specifically
that
way
in
advance
of
any
american
iron
freight
appearing
in
the
platform
that
he
won't
require
his
people.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
requiring
is
--
has
not
this
--
the
element
of
force
and
i
suppose
that
forcing
had.
this
court
apparently
construed
the
two
much
the
same,
because
it
used
the
phrase
force,
not
requiring,
referring
generally
to
the
8
(b)
(4)
--
the
meaning
of
8
(b)
(4).
but,
there's
no
requiring
here
either,
because
requirement,
again,
announce
--
would
imply
some
element
of
against
the
will,
i
suppose.
and
the
dictionary
definitions
would
as
set
forth
in
our
briefs
would
indicate
that.
and
here,
there
is
no
element
of
coercion
whatsoever
because
the
employers
agree
long
in
advance
that
he
wouldn't
do
this
--
that
people
would
do
this
unloading.
and
finally,
we
have
the
final
element
of
8
(b)
(4)
which
is
that
the
causing
of
a
strike,
employees
of
a
neutral
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
--
must
be
for
an
object,
an
object
of
inducing
that
neutral
not
to
deal
with
someone
else.
in
this
case,
in
other
words,
the
purpose
of
our
request
to
the
employees
not
to
handle
american
iron
must
have
been
for
an
actual
object
of
inducing
the
carriers
not
to
deal
with
american
iron
as
such.and
we
say
that
was
not
our
extra
logic
here
and
object,
a
real
object
or
natural
object.
our
logical
object
was
merely
to
obtain
compliance
with
the
contract
to
see
to
it
that
the
--
that
can
--
do
not
have
to
act
in
any
strike
breaking
capacity.
that
was
merely
a
(inaudible)
that
american
iron
happened
to
be
involved.
the
union
had
no
evidence
against
american
iron
that
could
have
been
a
thousand
in
one
other
employers
that
the
carriers
might
have
been
dealing
with,
that
there
was
no
actual
object
to
get
after
american
iron.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
american
iron
and
so
therefore,
for
the
board
to
conclude
that
it
was
an
object
as
to
confuse
the
effect
of
what
we
did
with
what
the
actual
object
was
and
that
therefore,
the
fourth
object
--
the
fourth
element
of
an
8
(b)
(4)
violation
is
not
present
in
this
case.
so
we
say
both
by
virtue
of
the
general
purpose
of
congress
and
finally
by
application
of
the
words
used
by
congress
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
we
have
no
8
(b)
(4)
violation
here
either
by
reason
of
the
making
or
the
existence
of
struck
good
agreement
or
finally
by
the
--
attempt
by
the
union
to
enforce
the
agreement
by
asking
its
employees
at
the
dock
pursuant
to
that
agreement
not
to
unload
american
iron
freight
when
it
came
to
the
docks.
well,
we've
got
a
little
time
for
the
question
of
icc
and
genuine
parts
decision
of
the
board,
interstate
commerce.
as
the
board
indicated,
the
interstate
--
the
genuine
parts
decision
was
decided
after
this
case
had
gone
through
this
--
this
case
here
had
gone
through
the
court
of
appeals
below.
i
think
after
certiorari
was
granted
here.
in
the
genuine
parts
case,
two
members
of
the
board
decided
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
--
the
hot
cargo
clause
as
such
on
its
phase,
the
making
of
it,
the
existence
of
it
was
contrary
to
public
policy
in
the
legal
under
taft-hartley.
now,
i
don't
--
that
--
that
issue,
i
don't
think
is
part
of
this
case.
this
wasn't
argued
below,
brief
below
or
decide
below.
board
has
interposed
here
in
its
brief
and
of
the
entire
genuine
parts
decision
as
an
appendix
to
their
brief.
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
answer
--
to
make
that
argument,
which
we
will
get
here
sooner
or
later,
i
suppose,
about
the
validity
of
hot
cargo
goods
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
do
want
to
just
point
out
a
couple
of
problems
though
which
we
will
have
to
meet
when
we
do
get
that
case
before
this
court
in
which
it
does
illustrates
a
little
credence
at
this
point
perhaps
this
court
can
give
to
the
genuine
parts
case,
in
this
particular
case.
first
place,
one
major
problem
at
the
outset
is
whether
dock
employees
that
are
involved
here
in
american
iron,
dock
employees
as
distinguished
from
drivers
are
even
subject
to
icc
regulations.
normally,
they
are
under
wage
hour,
not
icc.
second
is
that
any
function
of
the
board
--
the
labor
board
or
these
two
members
of
labor
board
anyway
to
attempt
to
--
to
adjudicate
for
the
icc
in
icc
area
--
in
an
icc
area.
whether
hot
cargo
agreements
violate
that
act.
the
board
here,
believe
it
or
not,
has
these
two
members
anyway
have
said
that
the
hot
cargo
agreement
is
--
not
that
it's
illegal
under
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
because
of
its
language,
but
it's
illegal
because
of
the
language
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
in
other
words,
they
put
themselves
in
a
place
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
had
made
a
decision
for
them.
this,
they
did
about
two
weeks
before
the
icc
itself
decided
that
very
case
in
which
the
icc
--
that's
galveston
truck
line
corp.
versus
ada
motorlines
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
galveston
truck
line
corp.
versus
ada
motorlines
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
icc
said
in
so
many
words
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction
under
icc
or
under
ica
to
determine
the
legality
under
ica
of
this
hot
cargo
agreement.
and
we're
not
going
to
determine,
although
they
were
very
strongly
urged
to
determine.
we
are
not
going
to
determine
that
issue
and
we
will
never
determine
that
issue.
and
they
said
that
that
is
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
that
board
alone
to
adjudicate.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
was
a
full
commission
not
a
panel,
full
commission.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
they
did
decide
this,
your
honor.
they
did
decide
that
in
that
particular
case,
the
hot
cargo
agreement
as
such
may
or
may
not
be
applicable.
the
question
whether
it
was
really
invoked
or
not.
but
they
did
say
in
dicta.
they
did
say
this
in
dictum.
they
said
that
the
bare
assertion
of
a
hot
cargo
clause
by
a
carrier
as
an
excuse
for
fare
to
interline
freight
would
not
--
would
not
be
allowed
by
them.
that
they
would
not
permit
the
bare
assertion
of
that
clause
as
an
excuse
for
refusing
to
accept
goods
to
borrow
their
duties
under
--
to
accept
goods
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
they
went
a
little
further
than
they
had
before,
sir.
there
are
three
or
four
earlier
icc
decisions
in
the
field,
two
involving
montgomery
ward
company,
another
is
planters
peanut
--
i
forgot
the
fourth.
in
those,
they
--
in
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
montgomery
ward
cases
they're
in
our
brief,
i
think.
in
one
of
montgomery
ward
cases,
the
board
--
the
full
icc
did
hold
that
a
refusal
across
a
picket
line
clause,
which
is
greatly
akin
to
the
struck
goods
clause
entered
into
between
a
carrier
and
a
union,
constituted
an
excuse
for
not
accepting
goods
across
that
line,
which
is
--
which
would
seem
to
be
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
was
not,
your
honor.
it
was
not.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
that
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
but
the
hot
cargo
clause
was
not
involved
in
those
cases.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
there
are
plenty
case
on
that,
plenty
case
on
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
right.
whether
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
very
much
so.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
of
course
all
sorts
of
elements
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
for
instance,
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
this
court
here,
american
tobacco.
very
--
almost
explicitly
said
so.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
weber
versus
anheuser-busch
and
general
drivers
versus
american
tobacco.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
american
tobacco
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
will
tell
you
why.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
american
tobacco,
the
precise
issue
was
this.
it
was
a
hot
cargo
clause
in
a
carriers'
agreement,
interstate
commerce
carriers
agreement,
which
the
state
courts
held
was
invalid
under
state
law
as
a
--
is
not
complying
with
the
carrier's
duty
under
state
law
to
accept
all
merchandise.
the
court
said
specifically
--
the
court
of
texas
--
kentucky
court
said
specifically
that
that
clause
is
illegal
under
our
law
because
it
conflicts
with
the
common
carriers
duties.
this
court
says
that
we
don't
care
what
you
say
about
the
common
carriers
duties
or
the
validity
of
this
clause.
it
didn't
say
that
because
of
the
per
curiam
decision,
but
i
suppose
imply
to
this
because
it
reverse
the
court
above
and
said
that
in
effect,
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
labor
board
to
determine
the
validity
of
these
clauses
as
had
been
determined
in
other
cases
and
that
the
taft-hartley
act
has
preempted
the
state
court
from
making
that
determination
of
validity.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
general
drivers
versus
american
tobacco
company
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
which
is
a
per
curiam
following
weber
versus
anheuser-busch.
in
weber
versus
anheuser-busch,
we
did
have
a
clause
though
which
the
--
between
--
agreed
between
the
union
and
the
employer,
which
said
that
the
employer
can
deal
with
only
certain
types
of
outside
contractors,
fair
contractors.
union
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
interstate
commerce
act
wasn't
involved
in
that.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
--
it
does
not.
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
does
not.
the
interstate
commerce
act
merely
says
that
it's
the
--
the
general
duty
to
accept
all
freight.
you
can
be
excused
from
doing
this
depending
on
circumstances.
and
then
they
look
to
see
whether
you're
reasonable
if
there
is
a
hurricane
or
if
there's
a
strike.
many
cases
have
held
that
if
there
is
a
strike,
you're
excused.
other
--
other
features
which
may
intervene,
which
excuse
reasonably
the
carrier
from
carrying
out
his
duties.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i
haven't,
your
honor.
we
didn't
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there's
no
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
is
no
such
--
there's
no
such
precise
language.
there
is
none,
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
doesn't
say
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
says
that
they
will
not
discriminate
--
yes,
they
said
they
shall
not
discriminate
it.
it
doesn't
say
that
it's
their
precise
duty
to
or
not
to
go
in
a
particular
case
to
accept
freight
or
not
do
it.
that
depends
on
the
circumstances.
but
--
but
the
law
is
that
there
is
a
duty,
common
law
and
--
the
interstate
commerce
act
duty
to
accept
freight
nondiscriminatorily.
but
you
can
be
excused
from
that
duty
in
a
particular
situation
depending
on
all
of
the
circumstances.
now,
maybe
the
element
of
a
hot
cargo
clause
is
or
is
not
a
circumstance
which
would
excuse
them.
we
suggest
that
american
tobacco
might
imply
that
it
would
offer
an
excuse.
if
congress,
having
taken
this
subject
in
hand
and
having
said
that
certain
types
of
agreement
are
valid,
because
they
are
--
they
are
helpful
in
--
in
the
management
--
labor
management
area
and
that
unions
has
certain
rights
to
engage
in
activities
for
mutual
aid
and
assistance
and
can
attempt
to
preserve
these
rights,
to
prevent
themselves
from
being
strike
breakers
as
part
of
protections
afforded
under
taft-hartley
and
the
employer
enters
into
an
agreement
which
observes
that
right.
maybe
that
will
bore
an
excuse.
we
don't
know.
this
--
this
precise
galveston
case
did
not
plan
to
determine
that,
because
the
hot
good
--
struck
goods
clause
were
mentioned
only
in
passing.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
and
we're
purported
to
that.
i
could
say
very
briefly
here
that
the
section
10
(a)
of
the
act,
of
the
taft-hartley
act
expressly
imports
transportation,
the
whole
field
of
transportation
into
the
hands
of
the
labor
board
alone.
transportation
is
one
of
the
few
things
that
the
board
cannot
delegate
to
a
state
board,
under
section
10
(a).
furthermore,
section
10
(a)
says
that
the
board's
power
of
adjudication
"shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
law."
it
makes
that
--
congress
puts
that
flat
provision
in
section
10
(a).
now,
since
taft-hartley
antedated
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
some
years
very
conceivably,
congress
intended
that
the
board,
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
that
board
alone
make
adjudications
in
the
field
of
transportation,
including
the
validity
of
struck
goods
agreements,
which
cannot
be
affected
by
other
intervening
sources,
state
or
federal.
i
suppose
if
it
is
important
to
have
a
single
administrative
body
in
the
single
guiding
authority
in
this
field
of
labor
management
relations,
then
this
court
should
resist
intrusion
from
any
source,
state
or
federal.
it
is
consistent
to
resist
that
intrusion
from
a
federal
--
from
a
state
source
under
the
doctrine
of
preemption.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
sir.
the
specific
reference
to
that
i
mean.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
exempts
that
specifically.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
specifically
exempts.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
except
the
question
of
whether
employees
have
a
right
to
engage
in
a
mutual
aid
and
assistance
pacts
with
employers.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
given
under
section
7,
rights
to
engage
in
activities
for
mutual
aid
and
assistance
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
expressly
said.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
taft-hartley
field.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
we're
talking
about
motor
carriers
which
are
not
--
which
is
something
else.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
right.
we
have
two
--
we
have
two
federal
laws.
one,
an
earlier
law
and
one
a
later.
we
have
a
possible
conflict
in
a
field
of
labor
relations.
motor
carrier
act
does
not
give
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
interstate
commission
just
held
any
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
in
the
field
of
hot
cargo
at
all
and
they're
not
going
to
this
yet.
that's
for
the
labor
board.
we
say
if
the
labor
board
has
that
jurisdiction,
which
it
has,
if
congress
said
that
that
right
to
adjudicate
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
law
which
it
has
said
and
has
specifically
said
that
transportation
which
has
got
to
include
motor
freight
transportation,
because
the
other
railroad
transportation
has
specifically
taken
out,
which
has
got
to
include
motor
carrier
transportation.
that
specifically
is
very
carefully
preserved
for
the
labor
board.
under
those
circumstances,
we
say
we
have
a
case
of
supersession
if
not
preemption.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
or
other
circumstances,
including
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
it
may
be,
but
i'm
not
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
i
don't
mean
to.
if
i
am,
that's
because
i'm
not
fully
prepared
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
at
all.
that's
not
in
this
case.
the
case
does
have
--
that
case
when
it
reaches
this
court
of
the
very
respective
areas
of
jurisdiction
on
this
issue
between
icc
and
the
labor
board.
there
are
many,
many
problems
which
i
haven't
even
attempted
to
touch
here,
but
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
all
members
of
the
board,
in
this
case,
held
that
the
particular
hot
cargo
clause
in
this
case
is
legal
under
taft-hartley.
no
member
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no
member
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you
do
have
a
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you
do
have
--
you
do
have
a
question
of
whether
then
perhaps
the
case
would
be
remanded
to
the
court
below
if
they
have
the
chance
to
pass
on
this,
but
the
thing
was
never
argued
anywhere,
never
suggested
by
any
board
member
even
until
after
the
court
--
this
court
has
headed
to
accept
certiorari
in
the
present
case
and
if
we're
going
to
have
to
meet
that
argument,
we'd
like
to
have
a
chance
to
fully
brief
and
really
argue
it.
but
i
don't
see
how
since
there's
only
two
members
of
the
board
that
taken
this
position,
number
one.
since
in
any
event,
we
have
a
carpenters
case
here,
which
doesn't
involve
any
element
of
icc.
we
have
the
(inaudible)
case
pending
on
certiorari.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
which
are
different
cases,
but
we
have
the
case
right
now,
which
doesn't
involve
icc.
if
the
board
wants
to
--
if
someone
wants
to
say
that
some
teamsters
unions
can
have
a
hot
cargo
clause
and
the
others
can't,
i
don't
--
i
say
we
should
be
given
a
chance
to
argue
in
brief
that
--
that
aspect
if
that's
going
to
be
introduced
here.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that's
right
unless
--
unless
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
we
have
to
find
that
out
in
the
precise
brought
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
i
agree.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
arrive
that
in
a
case
brought
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
when
there's
no
complaint
in
this
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
and
there's
no
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right,
and
there's
no
complaints
here
that
in
this
case
and
it
couldn't
be
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
been
violated
in
any
way
when
and
if
there
is
such
a
complaint
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
adjudicated
on
it,
then
we
can
come
up
here
and
argue
what
--
which
forum
has
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
there
might
be
some
real
basis
in
protecting
the
duty
of
the
carrier
broadly
and
permitting
them
to
enter
into
these
types
of
agreements
because
supposing
--
because
these
hot
cargo
agreements
do
serve
to
greatly
narrow
the
area
of
the
dispute
conceivably
if
there
was
trouble
somewhere
else
and
the
employees
didn't
want
to
unload
and
the
carrier
insisted
that
they
unload,
maybe
his
whole
--
his
whole
operation
would
be
shutdown.
and
in
that
event,
not
only
just
american
iron,
but
all
of
the
other
employers
with
whom
the
carrier
might
deal
would
be
--
would
not
have
their
freight
delivered.
so
there
is
--
certainly,
you
aren't
in
opposition
to
the
congressional
purpose
of
providing
free
shipments
of
goods
when
you
merely
limit
to
the
particular
situation
like
in
this
case
in
the
--
to
the
american
iron
situation
rather
than
encourage
a
strike
in
the
old
carriers
operations.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
but
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
will
have
to
be
met,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
right
but
the
carrier
has
that
duty
--
he
also
has
the
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
over
traditional
subject
matters
of
bargaining.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
what
about
if
it's
tariff?
what
if
his
tariff
he
said,
"i'm
not
going
to
hold
myself
out
to
take
goods
from
a
struck
plant,"
which
is
done
in
many
terms.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
now,
that's
up
for
the
icc
right
now.
that's
not
--
there
are
some
motor
cases,
a
pickup
delivery
case
which
says
that
such
a
carrier
is
legal
in
which
the
carrier
says,
"i
will
not
move
myself
out
to
having
to
take
goods
from
a
plant
that's
from
--
from
someone
else
that's
in
labor
trouble."
and
that
in
an
earlier
icc
case,
the
pickup
and
delivery
case
--
i
haven't
got
that
in
my
brief
here,
but
there
is
such
a
case
in
which
the
icc
at
that
time
said
that
such
a
tariff
was
legal.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it's
on
the
record,
but
i'll
endeavor
to
find
out,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
different.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it's
not
an
actual
party,
no.
the
only
parties
are
the
union
and
the
american
iron
company
which
is
not
a
carrier,
a
manufacturer.
