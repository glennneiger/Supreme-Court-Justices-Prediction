mr.
arthur
garrett
if
your
honors
please,
there
is
no
question
of
carriers
in
this
case
and
it
involves
doors,
rather
than
sand
and
gravel.
the
locale
of
this
case
is
los
angeles,
california
and
all
of
the
relevant
actions
and
declarations
occurred
on
a
billing
job
in
east
los
angeles.
the
only
other
location
in
the
area
relevant
to
the
facts
in
this
case
is
glendale,
california.
the
jurisdiction
of
another
carpenter's
local
union
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
say
that
because
distance
is
a
rather
large
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
there
is
a
distance
of
some
15
or
more
miles
between
this
construction
site
and
the
headquarters
of
the
glendale
carpenters
union.
now
the
construction
in
east
los
angeles
in
which
carpenters
as
well
as
other
trades
were
employed
was
under
a
general
contractor
whom
i
will,
havstad
and
jen
--
jensen
whom
i
would
refer
to
as
havstad.
havstad
was
a
party
to
an
area
agreement
made
for
him
with
the
carpenters'
union
by
his
employer's
association
called
the
building
contractors
association
and
that
is
the
terms
of
that
agreement,
the
essential
parts
of
which
are
set
up
in
the
transcript
here.
and
as
to
the
fact
that
that
agreement
was
at
all
times
binding,
upon
both
havstad
and
the
unions
and
havstad's
agents
and
the
members
of
the
unions
as
to
the
existence
and
effect
of
that
contractor
is
no
dispute
in
this
record.
pursuant
to
certain
contract
provisions
on
the
--
on
the
17th
day
of
august
1954,
nathan
fleisher,
the
business
agent
of
carpenters
local
union,
number
1976
in
east
los
angeles,
the
area
of
this
construction,
called
at
the
office
of
havstad
and
jensen,
which
was
on
the
jobsite.
he
had
been
there
the
previous
day
and
waited
three
hours
to
talk
to
someone
in
authority
apparently
not
being
successful
in
doing
so,
he
had
returned
on
august
17th,
1954.
his
visit
on
the
previous
day
is
established
by
the
testimony
of
the
office
girl
for
havstad
and
jensen,
which
is
in
the
record.
now,
when
fleisher
went
there,
he
got
there
reasonably
early
in
the
morning
at
which
time
the
only
person
in
authority
for
havstad
and
jensen,
was
one
arnold
steinert,
the
foreman
and
that's
where
this
glendale
location
comes
in,
because
steinert
was
not
a
member
of
any
union
in
east
los
angeles,
but
he
was
a
member
and
only
a
member
that
is
he
held
no
other
union
position
and
not
of
mere
membership.
in
the
glendale
local,
which
is
local
563,
there
are
many
other
carpenters
on
this
job,
all
of
which
were
members
of
nathan
fleisher's
east
los
angeles
local
union
1976.
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
nicholson,
the
general
superintendent
for
havstad,
establishes
that
not
only
had
he
secured
all
of
his
carpenters
from
that
local
union
over
a
long
period
of
years,
the
period
of
years
at
least
covered
by
the
existence
of
preceding
renewals
of
the
same
area
labor
agreement
that
he
testifies
10
years,
although
the
actual
original
execution
of
the
agreement
was,
as
i
recall
it
in
1941.
but
nicholson
testifies
that
for
preceding
10
years,
havstad
and
jensen,
for
whom
he
was
general
construction
superintendent
had
been
working
under
this
agreement
and
that
during
that
said
time,
he
had
not
only
been
getting
all
of
these
carpenters
from
nathan
fleisher
and
these
are
the
carpenters
local
union
1976,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he'd
been
insisting
on
talking
to
fleisher
about
the
dispatch
of
each
man,
that
is
he
would
not
--
he
was
not
content
just
to
leave
an
order
in
the
office,
but
he
had
those
men
there
personally
from
fleisher.
and
among
those
men,
the
two
men
on
the
job,
on
this
critical
day
who
come
into
the
evidence
are
the
agronovich's
father
and
son,
sam,
a
carpenter
and
sol,
a
carpenter
on
the
job
who
is
also
the
shop
steward
on
the
job
for
the
carpenters,
that
is
the
shop
steward
from
mr.
fleisher
and
his
carpenters
local
1976.
now,
the
testimony
of
mr.
fleisher
and
mr.
nicholson
and
mr.
steinert
establishes
without
doubt
that
there
were
only
two
persons
who
are
in
supervisorial
positions
there
for
the
general
contractor
havstad
and
jensen.
one
of
these
persons
was
mr.
nicholson,
the
general
building
superintendent.
the
other
was
mr.
arnold
steinert
whom
i
referred
to
as
construction
foreman.
steinert
being
at
all
times
in
complete
authority
when
--
and
it
sets
time
as
mr.
nicholson
might
be
absent
from
the
operation.
now
it
happens
that
this
visit
of
mr.
fleisher's
pursuant
to
the
contract
provisions
i
have
mentioned,
but
not
directly
outlined
occurred
on
the
morning
of
august
17th,
1954
and
the
transaction
was
completed
between
him
and
mr.
steinert
before
mr.
nicholson
even
came
to
the
job.
the
testimony
of
mr.
steinert
indicates
that
at
least
a
half
hour
had
elapsed
following
his
giving
of
his
instructions
to
the
carpenters
involved
in
this
contract
question,
a
half
hour
between
that
time
in
the
first
arrival
of
mr.
nicholson.
now,
as
you
may
have
assumed,
the
position
of
the
board
here
is
that
something
must
have
happened
in
that
half
hour,
which
constituted
a
--
an
inducement
or
a
direction
from
mr.
fleisher
directly
to
the
employees.
pursuant
to
this
contract
clause,
which
was
a
clause
that
said
in
so
many
words,
"workmen
shall
not
be
required
to
handle
non-union
material."
you'll
find
it
is
the
petitioner
carpenters'
position
that
such
a
conclusion
is
orderly
without
reasonable
foundation
on
the
record
considered
as
a
whole
or
at
all.
now,
there
had
been
and
this
was
the
occasion
from
mr.
fleisher's
visit
to
a
job.
a
shipment
of
doors
received
from
wisconsin
on
the
job
known
as
paine
doors.
that
was
the
reason
mr.
fleisher,
the
business
agent
had
been
there
the
day
before
and
that
was
the
reason
he
was
there
talking
to
mr.
steinert
this
morning.
on
this
morning
in
question,
mr.
fleisher
was
arriving
at
a
job
where
every
carpenter
on
the
job
was
a
member
of
his
union.
he
was
arriving
this
morning
on
a
job
where
every
carpenter
on
the
job
was
not
only
a
member
of
his
union
but
a
member
he
had
personally
dispatched
to
the
job,
according
to
the
invariable
custom
of
building
superintendent
nicholson
in
ordering
his
men.
and
he
was
furthermore,
arriving
at
a
job,
on
which
he
had
a
union
representative
mr.
sol
agronovich,
the
shop
steward
for
local
1976
of
which
mr.
fleisher
was
business
representative.
and
yet
on
the
preceding
day,
he
waited
three
hours
in
the
office
for
someone
in
authority
and
then
left
without
going
to
anyone
of
this
--
his
own
carpenters
about
these
doors,
and
i
expect
to
show
you
from
the
record
on
the
morning
in
question,
he
talked
to
not
a
single
one
of
this
his
own
carpenters
about
the
doors,
but
he
said
to
mr.
steinert
who
was
in
a
complete
in
charge
of
the
job
who
was
supervision
and
the
only
supervision
available
for
him
to
talk
to.
and
because
this
is
going
to
come
into
question
again,
i'd
like
to
read
it
verbatim
from
page
165
of
the
record,
the
testimony
of
mr.
steinert,
as
to
what
mr.
fleisher
told
him,
“you're
under
oath
at
the
board
hearing.
there
had
been
in
this
case
as
in
the
preceding
cases
a
previous
application
for
the
--
by
the
board
at
the
time
of
these
events
to
the
federal
district
court
for
a
taft-hartley
injunction
which
was
refused
them,
so
that
this
testimony
is
at
the
board
hearing
which
was
held
i
believe
sometime
in
around
april
of
the
following
year.
beginning
at
page
165,
where
the
board
attorney
is
asking
mr.
steinert
what
fleisher
told
him.
question.
“what
did
you
say
to
him
and
what
did
he
say
to
you?”
answer.
“well,
he
told
me
that
we'd
have
to
quit
hanging
the
doors
until
they
got
it
settled
that
they
were
union
or
non-union
doors
and
they
were
going
to
check
on
them
and
in
a
day
or
two,
they
would
be
cleared
and
we
could
go
ahead
and
go
to
work.”
“did
mr.
nathan
fleisher
use
the
word
“veil”
all
the
way
through
--
all
the
way
through
there
in
your
conversation?”
“well,
i
don't
remember.
no.”
“mr.
steinert,
i
want
you
to
recall
just
as
well
as
you
can
what
mr.
fleisher's
words
were
to
you?”
“well
he
said,
there
non-union
doors
and
they
didn't
have
a
label
and
we'd
have
to
quit
hanging
the
doors
until
it
was
settled.”
“and
then
what
did
you
say
to
him?”
“i
said
all
right.”
i
want
to
stop
at
that
point
to
interpolate
that
that
is
the
point
where
the
employer,
according
to
the
contract,
if
mr.
steinert
was
their
foreman
and
agent
as
he
seemed
to
be,
made
the
decision
on
the
question
of
whether
it
would
permit
the
hot
cargo
clause
to
be
invoked.
now
continuing
on
the
record.
“then
what
did
you
do?”
“well,
the
laborers
were
moving
the
doors
from
floor
to
floor
and
i
told
them
to
leave
them
alone,
leave
them
set
and
we
went
down
into
the
basement
where
sam
agronovich
was
working
and
told
him
we'd
have
to
quit
hanging
the
doors
because
they
weren't
union
until
they
got
it
settled.”
“did
you
tell
mr.
agronovich
to
do
anything
else?”
“i
told
him
that
he
could
put
his
tools
away
and
then
he
could
put
on
the
door
butts
on
the
metal
jambs.”
interpolating
again
the
previous
testimony
show
that
prior
to
this
time,
instead
of
working
on
the
door
butts
and
the
metal
jambs,
which
were
affixed
to
the
door
before
they
were
affixed
to
the
door
opening,
that
mr.
agronovich
had
been
working
on
jigs,
which
were
to
be
used
in
connection
with
the
fitting
of
the
doors.”
returning
to
the
record.
“that
was
the
same
time?
“yes.”
“and
mr.
fleisher
was
present
when
you
talked
to
mr.
agronovich?”
dropping
down
through
three
sets
of
questions
and
answers,
which
i
do
not
consider
essential,
i
want
to
resume
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
“when
did
you
first
see
the
superintendent
mr.
nicholson?”
“i
don't
know.
i
guess
it
was
around
11
or
a
little
after
11
o'clock.”
“how
long
after
you
had
given
these
instructions
to
the
carpenters
and
to
the
laborers?
was
it
that
you
first
saw,
mr.
nicholson?”
“well,
i'll
say
it
was
about
a
half
hour.”
and
i
would
like
to
interpolate
at
this
point
that
the
testimony
of
mr.
nicholson
here
and
after
given
in
the
record,
shows
that
he
has
been
away
from
a
job
until
or
had
not
arrived
on
the
job
actually
until
the
time
that
mr.
steinert
actually
saw
him
one
and
a
half
hour
after
giving
these
directions
and
that
mr.
steinert
had
been
completely
in
charge
in
his
place
instead.
now,
that
still
left
the
question
as
to
what
if
anything
had
been
said
in
this
conversation
between
mr.
steinert
and
mr.
sam
agronovich,
who
was
the
only
carpenter
actually
involved
with
the
doors,
and
that
was
cleared
up
by
cross-examination,
the
cross-examination
consisting
of
just
two
lines.
cross-examination
of
mr.
steinert,
question
by
mr.
nicholson,
“when
you
went
to
stop
sam
agronovich
from
hanging
the
doors,
did
mr.
fleisher
say
anything?”
“to
sam?”
“not
that
i
know
of,
no.”
now
later
on,
mr.
nicholson,
the
general
superintendent
arrived
on
the
job.
he
had
a
conversation
with
his
foreman,
mr.
steinert
and
with
mr.
fleisher.
that
was
at
the
job
site
also.
in
that
conversation,
mr.
fleisher
spoke
to
no
one
except
mr.
nicholson
and
mr.
steinert.
in
that
conversation,
mr.
nicholson
did
not
countermand
anything
that
mr.
steinert
had
said.
he
complained
about
shortness
of
notice,
but
he
did
not
complain
about
being
requested
not
to
hang
the
doors.
that
is
to
put
the
hot
cargo
clause
into
effect.
and
it
was
not
until
--
and
if
that
occurred
there
--
during
the
injunction
proceeding
in
the
federal
district
court,
that
any
request
was
made
of
any
workmen
by
management
that
hang
any
of
these
doors.
and
in
connection
with
that,
a
significant
thing
occurred
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
when
mr.
steinert
said,
“i
said
all
right
in
response
to
this
request
to
invoke
the
hot
cargo
law
or
the
hot
cargo
provision
--
the
hot
cargo
contract
provision.
an
important
thing
occurred
that
there
is
light
--
threw
his
light
on
the
question
of
whether
steinert,
the
foreman,
was
representing
management
when
he
acquiesced
or
whether
he
was
merely
acting
under
the
direction
to
the
union
and
it
is
upon
that
rather
fine
point
that
we've
been
charged
for
responsibility
for
violation
of
the
taft-harley
section.
now,
during
the
--
as
it
will
be
shown
by
the
testimony
of
both
steinert
and
nicholson,
during
the
hearing
on
the
taft-hartley
injunction,
it
appeared
that
a
weak
point
in
the
regional
directors
or
general
counsel's
petition
for
injunctions
appeared
in
the
fact
that
whether
by
fleisher
or
as
they
contended
by
fleisher
and
steinert,
the
weak
point
appeared
in
the
fact
that
an
inducement
or
encouragement
of
direction
has
been
given
only
to
one
workman,
sam
agronovich,
and
so
someone
who
was
interested
in
getting
the
taft-hartley
injunction,
one
of
the
charging
parties
i
believe,
the
charging
party
in
this
case
being
the
regional
distributor
for
these
doors,
sand,
recently
distributor
for
paine,
the
manufacturer
and
the
charging
party.
sands
or
someone
on
his
behalf
called
up
nicholson
and
said,
“here,
it
looks
like
since
these
inducements
or
representations
had
been
conveyed
in
whatever
way
they
were
conveyed,
the
only
one
workman,
we
think
you
have
to
go
around
and
talk
to
the
others
and
ask
them
whether
they're
willing
to
hang
these
doors.
and
it
then
appears
that
nicholson,
according
to
his
own
testimony
said
to
those
who
are
so
importuning
him.
“i
can
do
that.
i
don't
have
direct
charge
or
authority
over
these
men.
i
have
got
to
get
steinert
to
do
it.”
and
attend
to
those
that
at
this
later
day,
steinert,
sometimes
in
the
company
of
nicholson,
the
general
superintendent,
but
always
steinert,
the
foreman,
went
around
individually
and
ad
seriatim
one
of
this
men
and
said
to
them,
“will
you
or
will
you
not
hang
these
doors?”
and
they
all
said
they
didn't
care
to
do
it.
now,
i'm
impressed.
before
we
leave
the
facts
with
several
things,
one
is
that
fleisher,
the
business
agent,
had
wanted
to
make
a
direct
demand
or
direction
or
inducement
to
the
carpenters
who
were
to
be
involved
in
hanging
these
doors.
he
had
every
opportunity
to
do
so
although
he
didn't.
they
were
his
own
members.
he
dispatched
everyone
of
them
personally
to
the
job.
presumably
he
knew
everyone
of
them
personally.
he
had
his
own
shop
steward
on
the
job.
in
fact,
he's
a
sponsor
or
he's
intermediary
and
yet
we
find
him
not
addressing
a
single
word
to
any
one
of
them
and
in
fact
waiting
alone
in
the
office
for
several
hours
on
the
proceeding
days
rather
than
contacting
his
men
who
were
right
on
the
other
side
of
the
door.
now,
i'm
impressed
with
the
fact
that
steinert,
who's
made
in
the
findings
an
award
of
the
board
and
in
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
a
mere
instrument
of
the
respondent,
the
petitioners
here
that
what
we
contend
is
merely
a
--
a
semantic
exchange.
i'm
impressed
with
the
fact
that
he
had
no
connection
either
with
steinert
or
his
local
union,
that
he
held
no
position
in
any
union,
and
that
his
union
affiliation,
although
with
the
carpenters
union,
was
with
the
carpenters
union
far
--
far
distant.
i'm
impressed
with
the
fact
that
he
was
so
much
the
instrumentality
of
many
that
in
this
demand
that
were
finally
made
on
the
carpenters
after
management
had
once
consented
to
the
contrary
when
these
demands
were
finally
made
upon
the
carpenters
to
set
the
doors.
only
steinert
was
deemed
by
management,
the
person
qualified
to
be
the
avenue
for
the
making
of
this
demand.
now,
we
are
charged
in
the
point
as
amended,
on
which
we
went
to
hearing
in
this
case
with
instructing
and
inducing
and
encouraging
these
employees,
the
very
carpenters
who
were
employees
of
havstad
i've
been
talking
about
to
refuse
to
install
these
doors
and
we're
charged
in
the
same
complaint
with
having
done
so
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
in
business
relations,
between
paine
and
sand,
pain
is
distributor
on
the
one
hand
and
havstad
and
jensen,
the
building
contractor
and
watson
and
the
dreps
on
the
other,
watson
and
dreps
being
the
middleman
after
which
havstad
and
jensen
purchased
the
doors
from
sands.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
evidence
that
whatever
the
respondent
union
did
in
this
case
was
done
for
any
purpose
other
than
to
exercise
their
rights
under
this
hot
cargo
labor
provision
event.
now
in
that
connection,
the
position
of
the
union
is
this.
particularly
since
1947,
we
pursue
our
organizing
and
representative
of
carpenter
employees
in
southern
california
subject
to
the
permission
and
subject
to
the
hindrance
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
their
pronouncements,
and
we
follow
closely,
since
the
ravelin
case
was
maintained
in
our
contracts,
the
hot
cargo
waiver
provision,
which
i
have
mentioned
to
you
before,
single
line
and
one
of
the
longer
paragraphs
of
the
contract,
it
says
that
no
work
minimal
required
to
handle
non-union
goods.
in
the
record
of
this
case,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
doors
i've
been
talking
to
you
about
were
non-union,
just
that,
non-union.
now,
it
is
of
course
a
practical
fact
that
the
man
who
works
on
struck
goods
in
his
own
plant
is
acting
against
the
strikers
in
the
plant
that
produced
those
goods
just
the
same
as
though
he
were
to
go
to
that
other
plant
and
walk
through
the
picket
line
of
those
strikers.
to
the
same
extent,
the
same
thing
can
be
said
of
non-union
goods.
in
the
same
situation,
the
same
thing
can
be
said
of
the
employer
who
brings
into
his
plant
non-union
or
struck
goods
and
has
them
work
on
there.
that's
particularly
true
of
course
to
the
situation
of
struck
goods.
now,
much
has
been
said
about
the
construct
--
construction
of
neutrals
in
this
hot
cargo
in
the
secondary
boycott
controversies,
some
of
it
by
this
court.
i
think
that
the
unions
in
southern
california
in
following
the
policy
of
this
board
as
laid
down
in
the
ravelin
case
and
incorporating
the
permissible
provisions
about
working
on
struck
or
non-union
goods
giving
their
men
an
option
not
to
work
on
those
goods.
i
think
that
both
the
unions
and
the
employers
have
felt
that
the
presence
of
such
provisions
in
labor
contract
give
the
employer
an
opportunity
to
avoid
being
conscripted.
on
behalf
of
a
labor
dispute
in
some
other
plant
or
industry
that
he
has
that
provision
and
his
agreement.
he
is
not
likely
to
be
put
in
a
position
where
he
has
to
take
one
side
or
the
other
and
somebody
else's
strike.
now,
if
you
will
look
and
i
know
you
will
at
the
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
follows
the
board,
you
will
see
that
while
it
might
appear
to
be
otherwise,
it
actually
depends
upon
the
same
principles
that
are
relied
upon
by
this
so-called
majority
in
the
board.
that
is
that
although
the
contract
clause
in
question
is
not
illegal
although
a
question
of
law
enforceability.
the
culpability
of
the
union
in
this
case
must
be
predicated
upon
evidence
that
they
induced
the
refusal
to
work
on
the
doors.
and
while
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
would
seem
to
rest
upon
other
evidence,
it
will
be
found
that
it
actually
rests
upon
the
assumption
that
nobody
induced
this
refusal
except
steinert,
the
employer's
foreman,
but
that
his
act
can
be
transferred
to
the
union
upon
a
theory
under
which
they
have
transferred
him
from
being
an
agent
of
the
employer
into
being
an
agent
of
the
union,
a
matter
i
want
to
go
into
a
little
more
later.
now,
you'll
notice
that
is
implicit
in
their
decision
because
they
say
--
mr.
arthur
garrett
i
think
that
the
direct
answer
would
be
to
that,
that
although
it
is
treated
thoroughly
by
both
sides
in
the
briefs,
the
petition
for
certiorari,
enumerating
the
points
that
has
been
raised
in
the
appellate
court
or
rather
the
circuit
court
that
says,
i
think
at
the
point
probably
you're
reading
and
we
rely
only
on
the
last
of
these
points,
which
was
the
point
that
related
to
the
hot
cargo
--
to
the
hot
cargo
waiver
clause.
mr.
arthur
garrett
that
is
right,
but
we
--
when
i
wrote
that,
i
forgot
that
implicit
in
that
question
was
this
question
of
agency
because
the
reason
they
say
that
we
can't
have
a
benefit,
i
should
have
said
that
we
want
to
raise
this
question
of
who
steinert
was
agent
for
too
because
--
mr.
arthur
garrett
that
may
be,
that
may
be.
the
briefs
however
argued
the
matter
on
both
sides.
may
i
proceed?
mr.
arthur
garrett
yes,
thank
you.
i
--
i
don't
think
we
took
advantage
of
counsel.
i
think
that
--
mr.
arthur
garrett
i
see.
well,
i
--
mr.
arthur
garrett
i've
been
conscious
of
that,
but
i've
also
been
conscious
to
the
fact
that
this
question
of
agency
as
related
to
steinert
is
inextricably
connected
with
the
legal
questions
connected
with
the
applications
of
this
car
--
cargo
waiver
clause.
i
believe
at
any
rate
and
i
won't
allege
with
the
issue
any
further
that
although
the
district
court
mentions
a
certain
evidence
such
was
--
such
as
at
one
point
in
their
decision,
they
say
fleisher
was
present
when
steinert
talked
to
agronovich.
but
then
you've
just
heard,
the
testimony
of
steinert
on
his
cross-examination,
which
was
that
although
fleisher
was
present
at
that
time,
he
didn't
say
anything.
now,
as
i'd
--
i'd
say,
i
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
--
to
conclude
that
everyone
has
concluded
here
that
--
that
the
union
induced
this
refusal
to
work
because
they
were
able
to
find
that
steinert,
despite
the
circumstances
i'd
mentioned
to
you,
was
the
agent
of
the
union
--
union.
now
on
that
question
of
agency,
if
i
may
be
heard,
the
circumstances
are
these.
steinert's
agency
is
predicated
if
anything
upon
a
number
of
documents
to
that
of
which
he
was
a
party.
steinert's
agency
for
the
union
isn't
predicated
on
anything
that
his
employers
said
to
him,
or
he
said
to
his
employer.
it
isn't
predicated
to
find
any
qualification
of
his
agency
resulting
from
his
employment
by
havstad
and
jensen.
it's
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
the
union
bylaws
contain
a
provision
that
--
as
what'll
be
found
in
the
record
on
page
--
on
page
198
and
199.
the
bylaws
of
the
district
council
of
carpenters
for
this
particular
area
are
shown
to
contain
the
language
quoted
in
all
of
the
decisions
in
this
case
and
quoted
in
the
briefs.
no
member
shall
use,
handle
and
install
or
erect
any
material
produced
or
manufactured
from
wood
that
is
not
produced
and
manufactured
by
members
of
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
and
joiners
of
america.
now
that,
connected
with
the
following
provision
that
all
foremen
are
equally
responsible
with
the
shop
stewards
for
the
enforcement
of
the
bylaws,
is
the
basis
for
the
holding
that
steinert
was
the
agent
of
the
union
and
not
of
his
employer
and
therefore
that
his
acts
although
apparently
the
acts
of
the
employer
were
actually
the
acts
of
the
union,
so
that
when
he
told
his
workmen,
"don't
proceed
with
this
work,"
it
was
actually
the
union
telling
him
that.
now,
i
want
you
to
consider
this
matter.
if
you
will
look
at
the
provision
on
the
bylaws,
which
i
first
read
to
you,
you
will
see
that
it
contains
another
sentence
preceding
what
i
read.
it
says,
“only
members
of
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
and
joiners
of
america
shall
be
permitted
to
do
carpenter
work
on
any
jobs.”
now,
as
given
in
that
form
in
the
bylaws,
that
sentence
would
seem
to
indicate
that
all
carpenters
on
all
jobs
from
the
time
of
their
employment
would
have
to
be
members
of
the
carpenters
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
carpenter's
contracts
in
this
area
don't
provide
that
even
before
the
taft-hartley
act.
they
provided
only
that
carpenters
working
on
a
job
should
become
members
of
the
union
after
a
given
time.
the
enactment
of
the
taft-
hartley
act
only
resulted
in
that
time
being
extended
for
30
days.
there
has
been,
as
you
can
see,
no
change
however
in
the
provision
to
be
found
in
the
bylaws
of
the
local
union
or
of
the
district
council.
now,
we
call
the
attention
of
both
the
board
and
the
court
to
the
fact
that
in
the
area
agreement
with
the
employers,
the
provision
is
made
not
only
that
this
is
working
on
the
struck
or
non-union
material,
shall
be
(inaudible)
with
the
man
that
they
won't
be
forced
to
work
on
it.
we
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
contract
specifically
provided
that
in
matters
between
the
employers
and
the
members
of
the
union,
the
provisions
of
these
bylaws,
which
are
relied
upon
by
the
board
here,
would
be
subordinate
to
and
would
be
waived
in
favor
of
the
provisions
of
the
area
agreement.
now,
the
conclusion
that
the
board
had
come
to
concerning
the
foreman,
being
the
agent
for
the
union
and
not
the
employer,
it
seems
to
me
totally
ignores
the
practical
effect
of
that
contract
provision.
i
think
it
is
rather
farfetched
and
absurd
to
say
that
the
foreman
is
bound
by
this
provision
in
the
bylaws,
which
is
the
second
part
of
the
--
of
the
paragraph
and
he's
not
bound
by
the
first.
i
think
a
fairer
interpretation
of
bylaws
and
contract
would
be
that
wherever
they're
in
conflict,
that
wherever
one
qualifies
the
other,
the
terms
of
the
contract,
government.
in
other
words,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
fair
to
say
that
we
could
not
for
a
moment
be
--
would
not
for
a
moment
be
permitted
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
california
to
discipline
or
fine
a
foreman
because
he
didn't
require
carpenters
at
the
time
of
their
employment
to
be
members
of
the
union
when
by
our
contract,
which
waives
the
provisions
of
the
bylaws
when
in
contract,
we've
said
they
don't
have
to
be
members
of
the
union
until
after
they
last
30
days.
and
i
think
it's
the
same
situation
with
respect
to
this
provision
about
not
working
on
union
goods,
around
non-union
goods.
i
think
that
while
that
is
in
the
bylaws
that
when
we
put
contrary
provisions
--
contrary
provisions
into
the
agreement
and
they
certainly
are
contracts
because
what
we
put
into
the
agreement
was
not
a
proviso
that
no
workmen
should
be
allowed
to
work
on
non-union
goods.
it
was
a
statement
that
they
would
not
be
compelled
to
work
upon
union
goods.
it
was
an
option
given,
an
option
which
incidentally,
the
employer
finally
required
to
be
definitely
exercised.
now
in
that
situation,
that's
the
situation
in
which
i
thought
i
could
come
before
you
in
the
first
instance
and
say
that
i
did
not
think
that
the
documents
involved,
there
weren't
any
justification
for
reversing
the
--
the
current
agency
of
mr.
steinert.
now,
there
is
one
other
thing
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
and
that
is
this.
with
respect
to
the
making
of
this
agreement,
the
question
may
arise
--
well,
who
told
the
employees
that
they
had
this
right
to
exercise
their
option
under
this
agreement?
our
answer
to
that
is
this,
that
at
least
in
matters
of
contract,
first
we're
governed
by
the
state
of
california
and
our
organizations
are
voluntary
associations.
when
one
of
our
--
the
obligations
of
our
contracts
imposed
upon
the
members
of
this
voluntary
on
incorporated
associations,
the
liabilities
roughly
that
will
be
found
in
partnerships.
the
organization
itself
is
not
inanity
except
to
a
very
limited
degree.
when
one
of
our
members
is
charged
under
a
contract,
he
doesn't
have
to
be
shown
to
have
been
a
maker
of
the
contract.
he
isn't
asked
whether
he
has
read
the
contract.
the
contract
is
proved
--
put
in
evidence
and
he
is
bound
by
it
just
like
every
other
members.
the
actions
a
member
takes
under
the
contract
just
like
the
liabilities
that
he
sustains
under
the
contract
or
the
actions
of
the
association
and
the
actions
of
the
association
are
therefore
his
actions.
with
respect
to
the
obligations
or
the
option
to
work
or
not
to
work
upon
these
goods,
given
the
individual
members
by
the
contract,
we
submit
that
the
ordinary
rule
of
the
contract
instruction
required,
the
inference,
which
i
think
is
a
governing
inference
here,
that
in
the
actions
of
this
men,
they
acted
pursuant
to
the
rights
that
they
had
under
the
contract
which
had
been
made
not
for
them,
but
for
which
they
had
made
themselves
and
by
which
they
were
bound.
i
thank
you.
