justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
take
out
of
the
consideration
of
the
case
the
railway
labor
act
of
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
said
this
is
a
legal
arrangement?
is
it
the
court
below
who
said
this
is
not
illegal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
without
arguing
what
your
view
is,
about
the
bearing
of
that
kind
of
arrangements
by
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
what
is
your
view?
what
is
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
a
railroad
in
other
words
make
a
contract
with
a
union
but
it
deems
carry
certain
goods
because
of
the
strike
interest
in
--
in
the
interest
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
question
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
must.
i
haven't
looked
at
the
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
part
from
the
taft-hartley,
would
--
is
there
any
controversy
that
this
would
be
a
hot
cargo
clause
or
a
carrier
--
the
union
people
would
violate
would
be
an
impermissible
limitation
upon
the
duty
of
the
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it
is.
i
can
see
in
that
argument
that
pleading
the
two
together
just
might
qualify.
but,
apart
from
a
hot
cargo
contract,
it
is
still
in
the
area
of
dispute
that
carrier
can
disable
itself
by
a
private
agreement
with
the
union
in
carrying
goods
(inaudible).
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
--
what
the
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
had
one
several
years
ago
with
--
involving
the
(inaudible)
what
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
a
hot
cargo
(inaudible)
their
rule
is
that
the
obligation
of
the
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
hot
cargo
but
you
did
go
on
the
question
that
the
duty
of
the
carrier
is
not
excused
by
the
fact
that
it
--
there's
a
strike
going
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
apart
from
that,
what
is
--
what
was
invoked?
has
that
been
invoked?
why
should
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
a
carrier
can't
--
refused
to
carry
goods
because
this
would
displease
my
employees
or
typically
where
the
strike
comes
from
the
shipper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
make
a
distinction
--
i
won't
take
more
of
your
time
--
between
that
problem
in
light
of
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act
(inaudible)
prior
to
1935
but
the
carrier
excuse
itself
in
carrying
goods
because
these
employees
are
in
sympathy
with
the
shipper's
union
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
i
wasn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
be
unique
in
the
law
that
things
that
are
not
illegal
in
the
sense
of
unlawful
nevertheless
in
certain
circumstances
don't
get
legal
sanction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
restricted
covenant
of
the
case
in
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
the
fisher
cut
bait
in
this
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
--
why
you
shy
away
from
justice
harlan's
question?
why
you
don't
say
that
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
what
it
is
and
that
you
don't
now
have
to
decide
whether
congress
may
have
thought
that
it's
an
impractical
worry
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
employer's
responding
to
this
kind
of
a
contract
and
there
will
be
time
enough
to
build
with
that
when
that's
the
issue
and
somebody
goes
into
a
court
of
law
and
try
to
get
an
injunction
or
money
damages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
we
have
to
always
decide
more
than
we
have
to
decide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
board's
reason
to
decide
at
anyhow.
that's
the
question
of
law
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
how
can
the
court
or
why
should
the
court,
the
board
decide
something
beyond
its
purview.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
when
is
law
become
a
perfect,
nice
logical
system?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
authorized
to
ask
us
to
issue
a
mandamus
against
the
board,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
leave
no
doubt
about
the
distinction
between
the
two,
because
the
state
did
not
but
as
to
common
carriers,
not
only
can
the
contract
not
be
invoked,
but
the
shipper
can
get
affirmative
relief
from
a
court
to
compel
a
carrier
to
take
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thatcher,
will
you
please
instruct
me
that
the
statute
specifically
makes
illegal
any
particular
--
any
kind
of
a
contract?
is
there
anything
in
the
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
says
this
is
an
illegal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
so
that
the
only
question
about
a
contract
is
whether
a
particular
contract
cuts
into
some
otherwise
restriction
in
the
acts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board
isn't
concerned
with
illegal
--
illegalizing
contract.
it
can
take
a
contract
--
an
alleged
contract
by
way
of
a
defense,
but
the
board
isn't
engaging
in
deciding
whether
this,
that
or
any
other
contract
is
against
public
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i'm
asking
about
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there
might
be.
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you
and
i
can
figure
more
than
i
contrast
that
the
union
can
enter
into
that
the
court
of
law
wouldn't
enforce
it
against
public
policy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
the
court
--
with
which
the
board
would
have
nothing
whatever
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
many.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
two
different
realms
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
that
judge
(inaudible)
suggestion
that
it
is
significant
that
congress
didn't
authorize
the
neutral,
it
recruited
--
enforced
neutral
from
giving
--
by
giving
him
relief.
he
only
gave
relief
to
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
what's
happening
now,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
private
party
has
no
right
of
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
and
some
of
the
--
or
even
be
available
to
the
disposition,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
suppose
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
standoff,
the
board
construction
has
something
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
is
a
standoff,
then
either
one
is
proper
and
therefore
the
board
prevail
as
i
understand
construction
of
a
dubious
statute,
put
into
the
hands
of
an
administrative
agency.
do
we
pay
no
attention
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
this
court
changes
its
mind.
that
doesn't
make
the
last
(inaudible)
negligible
one,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
starting
point
is
you're
at
session
or
exceeding
to
the
suggestion
that
there
might
be
a
standoff,
whatever
that
may
mean.
if
that
means
as
i
understand
it
to
me
that
it
could
be
either
one
or
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
weight
of
the
board's
finding
has
some
bearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i'm
troubled
by
having
in
one
case
an
argument
made
the
board's
finding
should
weigh
with
us
and
another
case
that
it
shouldn't
weigh
anything.
but
then
that's
--
that's
maybe
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
doctrine
in
the
mind
of
mine
that
this
is
like
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
equally
true
if
there
was
a
struck
goods
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
employer
told
them
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
told
his
employees,
"i
don't
want
to
get
messed
up
with
this
thing."
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
equally
true.
as
i
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
cargo
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
suggest
--
i
suggest
that
argument.
that
part
of
the
argument
really
begs
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
implies
that
it's
all
right
for
the
--
for
the
employees
to
--
to
be
induced
not
to
do
that
and
then
the
employer
says,
"all
right,
i
don't
want
to
get
messed
up
with
this,
so
don't
do
this
thing."
and
therefore
they're
not
in
the
course
of
employment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
--
about
sending
in
goods
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
people
whose
job
it
is,
but
they're
induced
not
to
do
it.
therefore,
that
piece
is
to
be
their
cause
of
employment.
i
suggest
that's
begging
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
if
he
has
no
commitment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
has
no
commitment
and
then
he
says,
"i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
this
thing."
and
then
tells
him
not
to
do
it,
when
they're
induced
not
to
do
it,
"it's
all
right,
i
don't
want
to
get
in
that
stuff."
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
i
take
it
out
of
the
course
of
your
employment
and
then
the
very
thing
which
makes
it
a
violation
of
the
act
takes
it
out
of
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
done
it
on
his
own
because
he's
been
induced
to
do
it
by
the
desire
of
the
men.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
you
know
what
term
that
is,
labor
relations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
they
decide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
model
about
that
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ask
you
what
i
asked
mr.
manoli.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
cases
have
arisen
in
the
court
for
a
shipper
got
affirmative
relief
as
a
carrier
accept
his
goods?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
yes
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
rest
on
the
duty
of
the
carrier
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
a
hot
cargo
contract
would
make
a
difference,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
suggestion
at
any
case
that
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
totally
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
cite
that,
mister?
you
know
much
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
cite
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
hartley
act
(inaudible)
railway
labor
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
does
it
exempts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
whole
business
of
labor
relations
on
railroad
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
left
that
the
board
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
how
do
you
get
that
what
you
just
read
as
a
limit
--
as
a
limitation,
a
limitation
about
the
--
upon
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
reference
to
a
scope
of
activity
in
which
the
board
has
nothing
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
that
--
that's
all
governed
by
the
complicated
machinery
of
the
railway
labor
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
the
taft-hartley
act
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
the
industrial
relations
on
railroads.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
duties
of
motor
carriers
to
carry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
limit,
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question
was
that
that
limited
the
duty
which
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
affirmatively
in
the
light
of
the
whole
history
of
interstate
carriers,
places
upon
carriers
to
accept
goods
if
they
are
presented
in
a
fit
condition
that
the
national
guard
doesn't
prevent
carriage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
sure,
if
we
got
an
act
of
congress,
we
wouldn't
be
arguing
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
why
it
isn't
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case.
i'm
not
saying
with
the
other
motor
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thatcher,
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
businesses
can
do
things
that
railroads
and
motor
carriers
can't
do.
that's
the
whole
point
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
what
the
board
has
got
to
do
or
how
the
board
can
enlighten
us
on
whether
or
not
a
carrier
is
released
from
the
otherwise
duty
of
carrying
goods
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
it
can't
be
brought
under
the
national
labor
relations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
none
of
their
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thatcher,
could
we
--
i'd
just
like
to
(inaudible)
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
become
relevant.
can
we
find
out
whether
the
tariffs
in
this
case
by
the
carriers
excluded
hot
cargo
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
may
make
a
difference
somehow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
still
leads
up
to
the
question
that
justice
black
put
a
minute
ago
whether
if
a
shipper
comes
in
and
has
that
portion
of
the
carrier
declares
before
the
icc
to
be
invalid
inclusion
that
the
commission
(inaudible)
