mr.

may
it
please
the
court.
cases
273
and
324,
which
arise
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts
are
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
general,
these
cases
like
the
one
that
follows
these
two
cases,
deal
with
the
effect
of
the
hot
cargo
clause
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
a
union
and
an
employer
which
purports
to
excuse
employees
from
handling
disfavored
goods,
the
effect
of
that
clause
upon
the
reach
of
the
so-called
"secondary
boycott
provisions"
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute
which
is
often
referred
to
us
the
"secondary
boycott
provisions"
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
basing
to
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
engage
in
a
strike
or
to
induce
or
encourage
employees
of
any
employer
to
engage
in
a
strike
or
in
a
concerted
refusal
to
perform
services
or
to
handle
goods
where
an
object
thereof
is
to
force
or
require
any
employer
or
other
person
to
cease
handling
the
goods
of
any
producer
or
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
the
principal
question
which
we
have
here
is
whether
union
inducement,
union
appeals,
union
directions
to
employees
not
to
handle
these
favorite
goods,
which
would
normally
be
within
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute
are
outside
or
removed
from
the
reach
of
the
statue
by
virtue
of
the
so-called
"hot
cargo
agreement"
between
the
union
and
the
employer
which
as
i
say
purports
to
excuse
the
employees
from
having
disfavored
goods.
the
subsidiary
question
in
this
case,
particularly
in
327,
is
whether
the
protection,
if
any,
which
extends
to
the
union
which
is
a
party
to
the
contract
--
to
the
contract
which
is
a
part
to
the
hot
cargo
clause
also
extends
to
a
union
which
is
not
a
party
to
the
agreement
but
is
engaged
in
conduct
which
normally
would
be
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute.
now,
let
me
summarize
the
facts
briefly
which
give
rise
to
these
issues
before
this
court.
in
1954,
the
machinists
union
which
represented
the
employees
of
the
american
iron
company,
went
out
on
strike.
and
in
connection
with
that
strike,
it
set
a
picket
line
around
the
premises
of
the
company.
as
a
result
of
the
picket
line
around
the
premises
of
the
american
machinery
company,
a
number
of
carrier
--
a
number
of
common
carriers
who
normally
serviced
the
american
iron
company
discontinued
making
deliveries
or
pickups
at
the
american
iron
plant.
and
thereafter,
the
american
iron
company
hauled
its
own
freight
and
its
own
trucks
to
the
loading
platforms
of
these
various
common
carriers.
these
trucks
were
followed
by
the
machinists
union
to
the
loading
platforms
of
the
common
carriers
and
there,
there
was
some
sort
of
a
picket
line
established
in
the
vicinity
of
the
truck
as
well
as
the
loading
platform
of
the
carriers,
and
the
machinists
representatives
went
to
the
employees
of
the
carriers
and
requested
them
not
to
handle
the
american
iron
freight.
now,
the
employees
of
the
carriers
were
represented
by
the
teamsters
union.
the
teamsters
union
and
these
various
carriers,
five
in
number,
had
an
agreement
--
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
one
of
the
clauses
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provided
that
the
employees
were
not
allowed
to
handle
--
not
allowed
to
handle
freight
from
an
unfair
company.
when
the
freight
from
the
american
iron
company
came
to
this
american
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right.
american
iron
company
came
to
the
platform
to
this
common
carrier,
the
representatives
of
the
teamsters
union
directed
the
employees
not
to
handle
this
freight
all
but
one
of
the
five
common
carriers
requested
or
directed
their
employees
to
handle
the
freight.
but
despite
the
instructions
of
the
employer,
the
employees
however
obeyed
the
instructions
of
their
union
--
the
teamsters
union
and
refused
to
handle
the
freight
which
has
been
brought
to
the
loading
platforms
of
various
common
carriers.
these
are
briefly
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
on
these
facts,
the
board
found
that
the
machinists
union
by
their
appeals
to
the
employees
of
the
carriers,
and
the
teamsters
union
by
their
directions
to
the
employees
of
the
carriers
not
to
handle
the
american
iron
freight
had
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute
regardless,
regardless
of
the
hot
cargo
clause
between
the
teamsters
and
the
common
carriers.
the
court
below
disagreed
with
the
board
with
judge
prettyman
dissenting
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
disagreed
with
the
board
with
respect
to
the
teamsters.
it
held
that
the
contract,
the
hot
cargo
clause
between
the
teamsters
and
the
carriers
was
not
unlawful
and
that
the
teamsters,
under
cover
of
that
clause,
could
appeal
or
instruct
or
direct
the
employees
not
to
handle
the
unfair
--
the
disfavored
freight.
as
to
the
machinists,
however,
and
here
judge
washington
dissented,
asked
the
machinists
the
majority
of
the
court
below
agreed
with
the
board
that
they
had
committed
a
violation
of
the
statute,
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
on
this
--
on
this
phrase
of
the
case
was
that
the
machinists
were
not
parties
to
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
teamsters
and
carriers
which
contained
the
hot
cargo
clause
and
therefore
they
could
not
rely
upon
that
clause
to
legalize
or
justify
their
conduct
which
otherwise
throw
within
the
prohibition
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
no,
we
will
come
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
i
will.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
below
held
that
the
arrangement
in
the
teamsters
and
the
carriers
was
not
--
was
not
unlawful
and
that
therefore,
the
teamsters,
the
parties
to
the
contract,
could
rely
upon
this
clause
and
go
to
the
employees
directly.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
interstate
commerce
commission
quite
recently,
your
honor,
has
held
that
a
clause
of
this
kind
does
not
relieve
a
common
carrier
from
the
obligation
to
service
without
discrimination
shippers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know.
there
may
be,
this
was
challenged
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
rely
on
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
challenged
its
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
he
challenges
that
--
yes,
he
does,
and
he
also
challenges
the
application
of
the
rules
under
the
icc
to
this
--
to
the
statute.
now,
there
--
i
think
it
can
be
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
there
can
be
a
little
question
that
apart
from
the
hot
cargo
clause
here
that
the
conduct
of
both
the
teamsters
and
the
machinists
case
--
and
the
machinists
clause
within
the
normal
prohibition
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
the
contract
to
one
side
as
i
say,
there
are
--
there
is
in
this
case
the
three
elements
of
the
violation
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
violation
and
these
are
inducement,
a
concerted
refusal
on
the
course
of
employment
and
finally,
the
illegal
objective
of
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
to
cease
doing
business
with
another
employer.
now,
it's
no
secret
–
and
i
think
we
may
as
well
bring
this
out
--
this
point
that
it
is
no
secret
that
the
board's
position
on
this
issue
has
changed.
originally,
when
this
problem
came
before
the
board
--
the
board
held
that
the
contract
for
the
hot
cargo
clause
legalized
--
legalized
action
which
would
otherwise
be
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
thereafter,
the
view
is
advanced
in
the
board
that
at
least
in
the
case
where
the
employer
repudiated
his
agreement
and
the
union
went
to
the
employees
and
asked
them
or
directed
them,
instructed
them
not
to
handle
certain
goods,
that
the
union
was
violating
the
statute
in
that
situation.
in
these
cases,
the
american
iron
case
and
the
case
which
follows
this
one
which
we
called
the
"sand
door
case",
the
majority
of
the
board
concluded
that
regardless
of
the
hot
cargo
clause
and
irrespective
of
the
acquiescence
or
non-acquiescence
of
the
employer
that
the
union
could
not
go
to
the
employees
and
directly
appeal
to
them
not
to
handle
the
disfavored
goods,
that
if
it
did,
they
say
regardless
of
the
hot
cargo
clause,
the
acquiescence
or
non-acquiescence
of
the
employer
that
the
union
committed
the
violation
of
the
statute
if
it
did
that.
now,
in
order
to
complete
the
history
of
this
problem
before
the
board,
i
should
add
that
since
these
cases
were
decided,
in
fact
while
these
cases
were
pending
here
after
the
writ
had
been
granted,
the
board
issued
its
decision
of
what
we
--
is
known
as
the
genuine
parts
case
and
we
have
appended
the
opinion
in
that
case
to
our
brief
in
this
--
in
this
case.
and
in
that
--
in
that
case,
a
majority
of
the
board
reached
the
common
ground
that
at
least
with
respect
to
common
carriers,
the
hot
cargo
clause
is
illegal
against
the
policy
of
the
statute
and
that
that
is
an
additional
reason
why
the
hot
cargo
clause
cannot
immunize
action
of
--
cannot
take
out
of
the
writ
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
appeals
the
directions
by
union
to
the
employees
of
a
carrier
not
to
handle
disfavored
goods.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
rely
upon
what
the
icc
has
recently
held,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
have
been
some
cases.
i
think
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
piggyback
case?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
was
--
it
didn't
involve
that
kind
of
a
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
question
there
was
whether
the
railroad
could
file
a
charge
with
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
with
the
board
and
invoke
the
protection
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
there
was
no
hot
cargo
or
agreement
involved.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
recall
that
there
was
any
advertence
to
that
issue.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
there's
probably
been
considered
more
on
a
common
law
to
that
effect
the
carrier
can't
excuse
themselves
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
and
the
problem,
as
i
say,
has
recently
come
up
before
the
icc
as
to
whether
or
not
one
of
these
hot
cargo
commitments
excuses
the
carrier.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
haven't
checked
the
law
that
far
back,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
probably
not.
i
don't
do
--
misstated.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
–-
as
i've
indicated,
there
have
been
these
varying
views
in
the
board
and
of
course
there
have
been
differences
of
opinions
among
the
board
members
itself
with
respect
to
each
position
that
the
board
has
taken.
and
the
courts
of
appeals
also
have
disagreed
on
this
question.
the
court
below
and
the
second
circuit
in
a
case
which
is
pending
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
have
disagreed
with
the
board's
position
that
these
clauses
do
not
immunize
or
take
out
of
the
writ
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
union
appeals
or
inducement
to
employees.
under
their
hand,
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
companion
case
of
this
one
here
and
also
the
sixth
circuit
have
agreed
with
the
board's
position
that
these
contracts
do
not
--
do
not
legalize
conduct
which
would
otherwise
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
these
conflicting
views
obviously
suggest,
i
think,
that
the
statute
itself
is
susceptible
to
different
interpretations
and
that
perhaps
each
is
not
without
some
support,
and
that
neither
the
statute
nor
its
legislative
history
furnished
easy
conclusive
answers
to
our
problem,
and
that
therefore
our
task
here,
as
it
often
is,
it
seems
to
be
very
often
in
the
case
of
labor
legislation,
that
our
task
here
is
to
find
that
interpretation
which
can
most
fairly
be
said
to
be
embedded
in
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
policy
and
purposes.
within
this
frame
of
reference,
i
want
to
turn
to
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
legislative
policy
and
purpose
behind
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute.
and
secondly,
to
indicate
how
that
--
how
that
congressional
policy
or
purpose
finds
expression
in
the
statute
itself.
a
part
from
our
different
reading
of
the
statutory
language,
itself
perhaps
one
of
the
more
important
and
perhaps
the
most
decisive
differences
between
us
and
the
unions
on
the
other
side
in
these
cases
is
the
--
are
different,
conflicting
understanding
of
what
the
legislative
purpose
was
behind
the
statute.
now,
i
think
there
can
be
a
little
doubt
after
one
reached
the
legislative
history
back
to
the
taft-hartley
bill.
there
can
be
a
little
doubt
that
congress
being
this
union-inspired
secondary
work
stoppages
as
undesirable,
as
inimical
to
the
public
interest.
indeed,
the
teamsters
brief
in
this
case
concedes
that
the
legislative
history
leaves
no
room
for
question.
congress'
undoubted
the
version
as
the
brief
puts
it,
undoubted
the
version
to
this
form
of
secondary
work
--
to
the
secondary
work
stoppages
or
sympathetic
strikes.
and
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
represents
the
congressional
purpose
to
remove
this
type
of
secondary
work
stoppages
from
the
american
industrial
sea,
and
the
purpose
with
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
intended
to
serve,
i
think
was
well-illustrated
by
senator
taft
and
the
examples
which
i'm
about
to
refer
are
at
very
--
are
very
aptly
to
cases
that
we
had
before
us
here.
during
the
course
of
the
debates,
senator
taft
stated
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
intended
to
meet
–
excuse
me
--
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
intended
to
meet
one,
the
situation
where
all
over
the
united
states,
the
teamsters
are
saying,
"we
will
not
handle
this
lumber
because
it
is
made
in
a
fact
where
a
cio
union
is
certified."
second
example,
it
was
designed
to
meet
the
situation
where
all
over
the
united
states
carpenters
--
and
i
might
say
that
in
the
second
case
which
follows
this
one,
the
carpenters
are
involved,
here
of
course
we
have
the
teamsters
and
the
machinists.
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
intended
to
meet
the
situation
where
all
over
the
united
states,
carpenters
are
refusing
to
handle
lumber
which
is
finished
in
a
mill
--
in
which
cio
workers
are
employed,
or
another
cases
in
which
american
federation
of
labor
workers
are
employed.
and
finally,
he
said,
"in
this
statute,
we
are
dealing
with
the
checking
of
deliveries
to
the
secondary
boycotts
or
jurisdictional
strikes.
the
trouble
is
that
the
man
drives
up
to
the
delivery
point,"
that's
what
happened
here.
the
trouble
is,
the
man
who
drives
it
to
the
delivery
point
and
because
the
teamsters
union
says
that
he
does
not
have
a
teamsters
cart
--
here
was
disfavored
goods.
then
the
union
and
the
plant,
the
unloaders
or
longshoremen,
or
whatever
they
may
be
will
not
unload
his
truck.
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
reach
in
this
case.
that
is
what
the
congress
is
trying
to
reach
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
and
perhaps
it
is
not
unfair
to
say
that
senator
morse
had
these
examples
in
mind
when
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
he
said
during
the
course
of
legislative
debate
that
i
want
to
point
out
that
under
the
procedures
provided
in
the
bill,
the
so-called
"hot
cargo
cases"
are
very
well
handled.
now,
for
a
number
of
years
prior
to
taft-hartley,
it
has
been
a
common
practice
among
unions
to
label
goods
as
unfair
or
is
hot
--
hot
cargo,
and
by
invoking
these
labels
and
going
to
the
employees,
inducing
them
not
to
handle
disfavored
goods.
this
is
the
classic
kind
of
secondary
work
stoppage
that
the
congress
meant
to
prove
--
prohibit
by
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
and
there
is
no
question
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
reaches
that
kind
of
a
situation.
it
also
been
the
practice
particularly
by
the
teamsters
and
the
carpenters
for
some
30
years
or
more
perhaps,
prior
to
the
adoption
of
taft-hartley
for
them
to
--
in
a
--
in
effect
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
employer
to
these
refusals
to
perform
services
or
to
handle
certain
goods,
they
would
get
that
by
means
of
these
hot
cargo
clauses
in
a
collective
bargaining
contracts,
which
i
say
purport
to
excuse
the
employees
from
handling
the
disfavored
goods.
now,
congress
was
aware
of
this
practice.
the
congress
which
enacted
this
legislation
was
aware
of
this
practice
and
we
think
that
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
congress
meant
to
draw
no
distinction
between
union
appeals,
union
labeling
of
goods
as
hot
cargo
even
where
they
had
no
contract
with
the
employer,
and
getting
the
employers
not
to
handle
those
particular
goods
or
the
situation
where
they
did
have
an
agreement
with
the
employer
and
then
went
to
the
employees
and
say,
"this
is
hot
cargo,
don't
handle
it."
we
think
that
congress
and
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
meant
to
reach
both
types
of
inducement
regardless
of
the
hot
cargo
clause.
now,
what
makes
me
said
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute
broadly
prohibits
secondary
work
stoppages
without
any
qualification
on
the
basis
of
any
contracts
where
congress
wanted
to
remove
certain
types
of
work
stoppages,
certain
types
of
secondary
work
stoppages
from
the
reach,
the
broad
reach,
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
it
expressly
did
so
in
the
statute
itself.
for
example,
in
the
companion
section,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
of
the
statute,
the
congress
removed
from
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
secondary
work
stoppages
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
an
employer
to
recognize
a
union
which
had
been
certified
by
the
board,
secondary
pressure
for
that
purpose
is
alright
under
the
statute.
in
the
jurisdictional
section
of
the
statute
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
the
congress
removed
from
the
reach
of
this
section,
a
strike
to
--
the
jurisdictional
strikes
where
the
employer
was
failing
to
abide
by
a
board
certification
or
by
a
board
order.
and
finally,
in
the
proviso
to
the
entire
section
--
the
proviso
to
the
entire
section
8
(b)
(4),
congress
expressly
exempted
from
the
reach
of
the
statute
refusals
to
cross
a
picket
line
at
a
primary
employers
place
of
business
under
the
circumstances
outlined
in
that
particular
section.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
initially,
i
could
say
that
the
only
question
presented
in
this
case
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
initially,
i
think
i
should
say
that
the
only
question
which
was
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here
was
whether
this
hot
cargo
clauses
exempted
from
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
the
conduct
and
union
inducement
of
employees.
in
the
lower
court,
as
well
as
before
the
board,
there
had
been
a
factual
issue
as
to
the
--
whether
the
inducement
has
been
directed
to
a
man
in
his
capacity
as
representative
of
management
or
in
his
capacity
as
a
member
of
the
union
with
the
obligation
to
enforce
the
union's
rules
and
there
also
the
question
of
whether
the
--
that
man
was
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
union
when
he
issued
instructions
to
the
carpenters
not
to
handle
these
doors.
those
questions
are
--
are
essentially
factual.
they
were
resolved
against
the
petitioner
both
by
the
board
and
in
the
court
below.
they
were
not
preserved
in
petition
for
certiorari.
and
contrary
to
mr.
garrett's
suggestion,
we
have
not
dealt
with
them
in
our
brief.
i
think
we
can
put
those
issues
to
one
side.
and
so
here
again
in
this
case
as
in
the
other
case,
we
have
this
basic
problem
of
whether
the
union
inducement
of
employees
not
to
handle
certain
good
is
removed
from
the
reach
of
the
statute
by
virtue
of
a
hot
--
of
a
--
of
a
hot
cargo
clause
and
the
clause
here
reads
slightly
different
on
the
clause
in
the
other
case,
something
to
the
effect
that
the
employee
shall
not
be
required
to
handle
non-union
goods.
and
here,
the
doors
which
havstad
and
jensen,
the
contractors,
were
going
to
--
were
going
to
install
came
--
were
purchased
from
an
intermediate
distributor
in
california
who
in
turn
had
purchased
them
from
the
paine
lumber
company
in
california
who
was
non-union.
and
when
these
doors
came
upon
at
the
hospital
project
where
havstad
and
jensen
were
working,
the
representative
of
the
union
approached
the
--
this
man
who
had
the
dual
capacity
of
a
foreman
as
well
as
a
member
of
the
union,
instructed
him
not
to
install
these
doors.
and
then
this
man
in
the
presence
of
the
union's
representative
went
to
the
employees
and
directed
them
not
to
--
not
to
install
these
doors.
and
despite
appeals
by
the
employer
--
request
rather
by
the
employer
--
of
these
employees
whether
--
whether
these
employees
would
or
would
not
install
the
doors,
the
employees
refused
to
do
so.
and
this
--
in
this
case,
the
board
held
--
in
fact,
the
decision
in
this
case
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
the
earlier
case.
the
board
held
that
irrespective
of
the
hot
cargo
clause,
irrespective
of
the
acquiescence
or
non-acquiescence
of
the
employer,
the
union's
inducement
of
the
employer
to
engage
in
this
conduct
violates
the
statute
and
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
us.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
here
that
this
is
not
really
a
secondary
strike
activity
or
sympathetic
work
stoppage,
but
that
the
employees
are
trying
to
force
their
particular
employer
was
entered
into
this
hot
cargo
agreement
to
carry
out
that
agreement,
that
when
they
refused
to
--
when
they
refused
to
handle
these
doors
or
in
effect
have
a
dispute
with
their
employer
and
that
they
are
seeking
to
compel
him
to
submit
to
their
demands
that
they'll
not
be
--
that
they'll
not
handle
any
equip
--
they'll
not
require
them
to
install
these
non-union
doors.
but
of
course
in
the
sense
--
in
the
sense
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
denver
building
case,
the
first
secondary
boycott
cases
to
reach
this
court
--
in
a
sense,
every
secondary
dispute
has
that
element
in
it,
but
the
base
of
real
dispute,
however,
is
not
with
a
secondary
employer.
the
dispute
or
--
is
--
is
with
the
disfavored
partner
either
because
he's
non-union
or
because
he
is
struck
or
because
the
union
for
some
reason
or
the
other
doesn't
like
--
doesn't
like
it.
and
the
hot
cargo
clause
--
the
hot
cargo
clause
in
essence
--
in
essence
requires
--
requires
the
employer
to
seize
doing
business
--
to
seize
doing
business
with
another
employer
who
is
disfavored.
and
when
the
union
seeks
to
implement
that
--
that
type
of
agreement
by
means
of
inducement,
it
is
engaging
as
i've
said
before
in
the
conduct
of
the
statute
prescribes
and
that
necessarily
the
forceable
consequence
of
its
conduct
is
a
sensation
of
business
--
is
a
cessation
of
business
between
the
employer
that
has
entered
into
this
agreement
and
the
employer
who
is
disfavored.
now,
under
the
statute
--
under
the
statute,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
sole
object.
the
statute
says,
“where
an
object
thereof
is
a
cessation
or
destruction
of
business
relations.”
and
congress
deliberately
--
originally,
congress
had
used
the
word
"the
object"
and
deliberately
changed
it
to
“an
object”
and
we
believe
that
that
requirement
is
satisfied
in
this
case.
now,
there's
also
been
a
suggestion
that
by
the
use
of
the
word
"struck
goods"
that
possibly
--
and
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
dispel
in
the
misconception
there
might
be
on
this
point.
i'd
use
the
word
"struck
goods"
that
here
we
may
have
a
situation
where
the
doors
were
in
unfinished
condition
that
came
out
of
a
struck
plant
or
of
a
non-union
plant
and
then
that
they
are
set
to
some
other
employer
to
finish
these
goods
in
effect
that
the
secondary
employers
people
are
being
asked
to
act
as
strikebreakers.
now
we
don't
have
that
situation
here
at
all,
either
in
this
case
or
in
the
other
case,
it's
an
entirely
different
case
where
may
well
be
that
there
is
such
a
community
of
interest
between
the
employees
and
one
group
is
not
required
to
act
as
strikebreakers.
but
in
this
type
of
case
so,
when
congress
--
when
it
was
dealing
with
the
secondary
--
when
it
was
considering
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
was
faced
with
the
argument,
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
had
made
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
(inaudible),
that
there
was
a
community
of
interest
between
the
employees
of
employer
a
over
here
and
the
employees
of
employer
b
here
so
that
if
these
employers
got
into
trouble
with
their
employer,
these
employees
over
here
should
be
able
to
help
them.
congress
specifically
rejected
for
better
or
for
worse,
specifically
rejected
that
philosophy.
and
while
these
clauses
may
be
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
union
--
while
these
clauses
may
be
entered
into
by
the
union
for
purpose
of
preserving
standards
or
what
have
you,
as
i
say
congress
specifically
rejected
that
concept.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
understand
your
honor
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
thank
you.
on
the
lone
point
of
the
agency
of
steinert,
i
should
like
to
correct
myself,
justice
black
said,
“correction,
i
--
i
certainly
merit.”
the
question
is
not
treated
at
all
in
the
board's
brief,
but
is
the
subject
of
an
entire
section
of
the
brief
that
we
filed
starting
on
page
19.
i
wanted
to
make
that
statement
because
perhaps
although
under
the
statement
of
issues
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
question
was
not
specifically
mentioned
as
i
say
i
think
because
i
thought
it
was
a
part
of
the
hot
cargo
waiver
clause
issue.
we
did
devote
a
considerable
portion
of
our
briefs
to
it.
now,
i
should
like
to
say
that
while
it
is
probably
implicit
in
the
consequences
of
any
inducement
not
to
handle
struck
or
non-union
material
that
a
consequence
will
be
that
the
trade
of
some
maker
or
handler
of
that
material
may
be
effective.
the
language
of
the
act
here
requires
that
such
effect
be
not
a
mere
effect,
but
a
union
objective,
and
it
was
the
lack
of
evidence
as
to
any
objective
of
the
union
rather
than
the
enforcement
of
the
contract
provision
to
which
i
referred
in
my
opening
argument.
i
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
court
arose
yesterday,
i
was
making
the
point
that
congress
was
aware
of
these
hot
cargo
agreements
between
employer's
and
unions
and
was
also
aware
of
the
practices
of
these
unions
to
invoke
these
hot
cargo
labels,
these
hot
cargo
contracts
and
appeal
directly
to
the
employee's
not
to
handle
disfavored
goods.
we
believed
that
congress
intended
to
draw
no
distinction
between
union
appeals
to
the
employee's
where
there
were
no
hot
cargo
contracts
between
the
union
and
the
employer
and
situations
where
there
are.
the
statute
itself,
as
i
indicated
briefly
yesterday,
the
statute
itself
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
statute
broadly
prohibits
secondary
work
stoppages
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
some
other
employer
to
yield
the
union's
demands
or
because
these
goods
are
disfavored.
where
congress
wanted
to
draw
an
exception
to
the
broad
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4),
it
did
so
expressly.
thus,
for
example,
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
the
companion
section
to
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
congress
withdrew
from
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
secondary
work
stoppages
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
an
employer
to
recognize
a
certified
bargain
represented.
similarly,
in
section
8
(d)
of
the
statute,
which
deals
with
jurisdictional
strikes,
congress
again
expressly,
removed
from
the
reach
of
the
statute
such
strikes
where
the
employer
was
failing
to
honor
a
board
certificate
or
a
board
order.
and
finally,
in
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(4)
itself,
congress
expressly
removed
from
the
reach
--
if,
your
honors
are
looking
for
the
statute,
it's
at
page
--
at
page
66
of
our
brief.
the
proviso
that
i'm
speaking
of,
page
67
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
that
in
that
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(4),
congress
specifically
removed
from
the
broad
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
refuses
to
cross
a
picket
line
at
a
primary
employer's
place
of
business
which
had
been
established
by
the
recognized
bargain
representative
of
the
employee's.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
these
expressed
exceptions
for
the
broad
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
suggests
that
if
congress
had
wanted
to
remove
union
appeals,
the
union
inducements
to
the
employee's
to
engage
in
a
secondary
or
sympathetic
work
stoppages
where
there
was
an
existence
a
hot
cargo
contract
between
the
employer
of
the
union
that
it
would
have
expressly
made
such
an
exception.
now,
congress
certainly
knew
how
to
do
that
and
i
think
that
this
is
illustrated
by
the
proviso
to
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
statute.
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
statute
deals
with
discrimination
by
an
employer
on
the
basis
of
union
membership
or
non-membership.
congress
wanted
to
remove
from
the
broad
reach
of
that
section,
union
shop
contracts,
and
it
expressly
provided
in
the
proviso
to
section
8
(a)
(3)
that
such
contracts
when
entered
into
executed
under
the
circumstances
indicated
in
the
statute
itself
that
these
contracts
which
of
course
compel
the
employee's
to
join
the
union
after
certain
period
of
time
that
they
were
removed
from
the
broad
reach
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
so
here,
i
repeat,
that
certainly,
congress
knew
how
to
do
it,
that
if
they
wanted
to
remove
secondary
work
stoppages
from
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
where
there
were
--
was
an
existence
a
hot
cargo
contract
between
the
union
and
the
employer,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
most
natural
thing
would
have
been
for
congress
to
have
said
so
specifically.
it
did
and
the
fact
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
statute
does
not
in
turn
make
these
contracts
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
did
not
outlaw
them,
but
it
did
not
affirmatively
sanction
them.
now,
the
board's
position
on
that
is
this,
your
honor.
a
majority
of
the
board,
in
these
cases
have
concluded
that
while
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
does
not
in
turns
outlaw
the
making
of
these
contracts
that
nevertheless
the
statute
prohibits
the
inducement
of
employee's
without
any
qualification
based
upon
these
contracts
and
that
the
--
when
the
union,
it
goes
to
the
employers
and
makes
direct
appeals
to
the
employee's
to
engage
in
the
sympathetic
work
stoppages
that
the
union
has
violated
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor
that
raises
a
very
nice
question
as
to
whether
they
are
enforceable
at
all
in
a
court
of
law.
i
suppose
that
the
answer
to
that
problem
will
depend
largely
upon
what
this
court
does
here.
but
if
we
are
correct
in
our
appeal
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
the
board's
position,
the
union
might
perhaps
go
to
the
employer,
employer
directly
and
appeal
to
him
to
abide
by
this
contract.
what
is
wrong
in
the
board's
view
is
that
the
union
is
going
directly
to
the
employee's.
board
says
--
the
board,
"the
union
cannot
go
to
the
employee's
because
the
statute
flatly
prohibits
that
kind
of
conduct.
the
union
possibly
might
appeal
to
the
employer
himself
and
there
is
nothing
we
could
do
under
those
circumstances."
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
employer
may
refuse
to
do
so
and
he
may
order
his
employee's
not
to
handle
these
goods,
but
the
union
may
not
do
so.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
now,
i
might
add
this,
your
honor,
that
one
member
of
the
majority
of
the
board
believes
that
these
contracts
against
the
policy
of
the
statute.
now,
however,
though,
it
is
conceded
that
even
though
these
contracts
may
be
against
the
policy
of
the
statute
that
nevertheless,
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
does
not
reach
the
making
of
these
contracts
or
does
not
reach
the
employer's
carrying
out
the
contract,
but
that's
what
the
statute
does
reach,
as
i
say,
is
the
union's
direct
appeals
to
the
employee's.
there
is
no
qualification
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
such
appeals
based
upon
the
existence
of
a
contract
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
correct,
sir.
correct.
now,
the
further
fact
that
suggests
to
us
that
the
congress
meant
to
draw
no
distinction
between
situations,
whether
it's
a
hot
cargo
and
whether
it's
not,
senator
taft's
explanation
of
--
one
of
the
--
an
explanation
that
he
advised
and
the
course
to
debate
on
the
senate
floor,
he
said
that
the
committee,
the
senate
labor
committee
have
heard
testimony
for
weeks
as
to
the
difference
between
good
and
secondary
boycotts
and
that
nobody
had
ever
succeeded.
so
he
said,
"had
ever
succeeded
and
explained
to
them
the
difference
between
these
different
types
of
boycotts."
and
so
he
said,
"we
have
made
all
of
these
secondary
work
stoppages
an
unfair
labor
practice."
now,
the
argument
is
made
and
we've
already
touched
upon
this
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question.
the
argument
is
made
that
these
contracts
are
not
on
law
and
that
therefore,
if
they're
not
unlawful,
there
should
be
no
reason
why
the
union
under
--
could
not
invoke
this
contract
and
appeal
to
the
employer's
directly
to
do
what
the
contract
presumably
permits
the
employee's
to
do,
that
is
to
refrain
from
having
disfavored
goods.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
assuming
that
we
are
correct
in
our
view
that
these
clauses
do
not
permit
a
union
to
go
to
the
employee's
and
even
though
it
may
be
true
that
the
statute
does
not
outlaw
the
making
of
these
contracts.
nevertheless,
if
a
union
were
to
go
in
court,
let's
say
section
301,
seeks
specific
performance
to
this
kind
of
contract.
i
think
the
problem
would
be
raised
whether
these
contracts
are
not
against
the
policy
of
the
statute
that
there
are
way
of
circumventing
the
protection
which
a
statute,
as
i
will
point
out
later,
which
a
statute
intends
to
give
to
the
public
to
other
employee's
at
large
and
possibly
and
i
am
only
speculating
on
this
because
it's
a
very
difficult
question.
possibly
a
court
of
law
even
though
we
ourselves
cannot
reach
the
execution
of
the
contract
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
a
court
of
law
might
declare
these
contracts
to
be
against
public
policy
and
hence
unenforceable
and
that
the
only
thing
that
the
union
can
do
in
answer
to
your
honors
question
is
simply
make
an
appeal
to
the
employer.
if
the
employer
goes,
it
may
have
no
more
than
that,
simply
that
the
employer
will
respect
the
commitment
or
not
but
not
to
be
able
to
enforce
it
either
by
strike
action.
you
say
certainly
it
cannot
enforce
it
by
strike
action
in
our
position
or
not
even
go
into
the
court
of
law
and
enforce
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
even
though
the
board
itself
has
not
reached
that
position
of
declaring
these
contracts
generally
as
being
against
public
policy,
they
have
reached
that
point
in
connection
with
common
carriers
as
i
will
explain
in
a
moment
that
much
of
what
we
say
here
in
support
of
our
argument
that
these
contracts
do
not
constitute
a
defense
to
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
i
think
points
in
the
direction
of
outlawing
these
contracts
all
together
as
against
the
policy
of
the
statute.
it
may
be
that
all
--
all
that
the
union
has
is
something
in
the
nature
of
shall
i
say
a
moral
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
respect
this
commitment
but
no
more
than
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
reach
that,
your
honor,
in
this
case.
i
think
that
it
would
be
enough
for
--
from
our
position,
from
our
standpoint
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
for
our
purposes
to
say
that
whether
these
contracts
are
legal
or
not,
the
statutes
flatly
prohibits
--
the
statute
flatly
prohibits
union
appeals
and
inducements
to
the
employee's
and
when
the
union
engages
in
that
regardless
of
what
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
contract,
that
the
union
cannot
engage
in
that
kind
of
conduct,
because
that's
the
very
unfair
labor
practice
that
the
statute
prohibits.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
as
an
individual
employee's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
rights.
that's
right,
because
the
statute
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
part
of
a
labor
organization.
it
has
to
make
individual
action
of
the
employer's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
position
of
one
member
of
the
board,
your
honor,
that
joined
the
majority
here
that
in
effect,
these
contracts
are
against
the
policy
of
the
statute
because
they
circumvent
--
they
circumvent
or
bring
about
the
very
evil
that
the
statute
were
designed
to
remove
from
the
american
industrial.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
i'm
coming
to
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
a
very
important
consideration
that
this
statute
was
designed
for
more
than
the
protection
of
the
immediate
secondary
employer,
but
it
is
also
designed
for
the
protection
of
the
public
at
large
and
was
also
designed
for
the
protection
of
their
primary
employer
that
was
involved
in
the
dispute.
and
that
their
interest
--
their
interest
in
being
protected
against
these
secondary
pressures
cannot
be
waived
by
the
immediate
secondary
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
i
say,
you
might
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
problem
might
well
arise
if
the
union,
for
example,
were
to
go
under
court
of
law
and
seek
specific
enforcement
or
seek
damages
on
the
--
from
the
employer
who
ignored
this
commitment,
then
i
think
the
question
would
be
squarely
raised
as
to
what
the
--
as
to
the
legality
of
these
contracts.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
as
far
as
our
statute
goes.
it
only
goes
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
have
a
board
majority.
and
i
have
to
--
now,
i
do
have
a
--
i
do
have
a
board
majority
with
respect
to
these
contracts
insofar
as
they
affect
common
carriers
and
this
brings
me
to
the
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
appreciate
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
appreciate
your
restatement
of
what
i
thought
i
had
said
before,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
quite
agree
with
your
--
with
what
you
say.
but
i
went
on
to
say
that
if
you're
asking
me
why
i
shy
away
if
for
no
other
reason,
i
have
to
shy
away
from
it
because
i
don't
have
the
majority
of
the
board
holding
at
these
contracts
generally
against
the
policy
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
am
the
spokesman.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
think
it
needs
to,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
need
to.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
let
me
turn
now
to
the
statute
itself
and
indicate
how
we
think
this
case
fits
into
the
statutory
phraseology.
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
violation
consists
of
three
elements,
namely
the
inducement
of
employee's,
secondly,
the
concerted
refusal
on
the
course
of
their
employment,
and
third,
the
illegal
object
of
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
or
other
person
to
cease
doing
business
or
handling
the
products
of
another.
we
think
that
all
these
three
elements
here
despite
the
hot
cargo
clause
are
present.
as
to
the
first
element,
the
element
of
inducement,
i
need
not
draw
on
that
very
long
because
the
record
amply
shows
that
both
the
machinist
and
the
teamsters
appealed
or
directed
the
employer's
to
carriers
not
to
handle
the
goods
of
american
iron
and
indeed
and
its
answer
to
the
board's
complaint,
the
teamsters
freely
admitted
that
they
had
directed
the
employee's
of
the
carriers
not
to
handle
these
goods.
now,
the
second
element
is
the
element
of
concerted
refusal
in
the
course
of
their
employment
and
i
will
break
those
into
two
sections.
certainly
and
literally,
we
think
that
there
was
a
concerted
refusal
in
this
case
and
that
whether
or
not,
the
employer
was
consenting
is
wholly
irrelevant
because
the
significant
factor
is
that
the
union
had
induced
in
a
concerted
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
employee's
towards
american
freight,
american
iron
freight.
now,
the
argument
is
made.
it
has
been
made
in
the
court
below.
it's
been
in
other
the
courts
which
have
disagreed
with
us,
that
cons
--
the
term
concerted
refusal
like
the
term
strike
presupposes
action
in
defiance
of
the
employer's
wishes
and
normally
of
course
that
is
--
that
is
the
case.
but
we
think
that
congress
in
using
the
term
concerted
refusal
in
the
statute
is
meant
to
go
beyond
that
and
they
meant
to
include
concerted
refusals
by
employee's
even
though
--
even
in
cases
where
the
employer
was
acquiesce
in
that
--
in
that
conduct.
now,
the
--
the
forerunner
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
is
of
course
was
enacted
in
1947
was
the
case
bill
which
came
out
congress
in
1946
and
which
was
vetoed
by
the
president.
the
case
bill
as
it
came
out
of
the
house
had
a
provision
banning
secondary
boycott
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
the
employee's.
concerted
refusal
(voice
overlap)
by
the
employee's,
that's
right.
the
--
the
case
bill
as
it
left
the
house,
had
a
provision
which
banned
secondary
boycotts
and
it
provided
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
by
means
of
a
concerted
refusal
to
use
hand
the
law
otherwise
do
et
cetera
or
to
induce
or
require
or
attempt
to
induce
or
require
another
person
to
recognize,
deal
with,
comply
with
and
--
or
employee,
members
of
any
labor
organization.
now,
when
the
case
still
came
to
the
senate,
senator
ball
and
taft,
who
of
course
were
among
the
principal
proponents
of
the
taft-hartley
bill
in
the
following
session
of
congress,
introduced
this
amendment.
they
wanted
to
make
it
a
violation
to
the
antitrust
law
for
labor
organization
by
strikes
or
threats
of
strike
or
by
concerted
refusal
to
use,
handle,
transport
or
otherwise
deal,
the
language
is
almost
identical
with
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
from
thereon.
they
had
added
to
the
house
bill
which
contained
that
it
was
unlawful
to
engage
in
a
concerted
refusal.
they
added
the
word
strikes
or
threats
of
strike.
now,
explaining
the
addition
of
the
word
strike
and
also
explaining
the
--
what
they
thought
concerted
refusal
meant
in
the
context
of
that
--
both
of
that
bill,
senator
ball
said,
"we
had
to
include
the
word
strikes
because
obviously
if
the
construction
union
says
we
will
put
on
our
own
fair
list
this
product
made
by
general
electric
or
westinghouse,
we
will
not
use
it."
and
the
employer
says,
"well,
i
will
go
along."
and
he
merely
stacks
it
up
in
the
corner.
that
is
a
concerted
refusal
to
use.
the
example
that
he
gives
there
is
one
with
employer's
acquiescing
in
the
employee's
refusal
and
senator
ball
says
that
is
a
concerted
refusal
to
use.
then
he
goes
on
to
explain
what
is
meant
by
strike
that
strike
was
something
in
defiance
of
the
employer's
wishes.
so
here,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
use
of
the
term
concerted
refusal
in
our
statute
which
is
in
a
context
almost
parallel
to
the
one
of
this
ball
amendment
in
the
case
bill
that
it
suggest
to
us
that
congress
meant
to
give
the
term
concerted
refusal
a
broader
meaning
that
action
in
defiance
of
the
employer's
wishes
that
it
also
meant
to
include
concerted
refusal
by
the
employee's
even
though
the
employer
was
acquiescing
in
that
action.
now,
the
further
argument
is
made
that
the
hot
cargo
clause
which
purports
to
excuse
the
employees
from
handling
--
from
handling
these
goods
in
effect
removes
--
removes
the
handling
of
these
goods
from
the
course
of
their
employment.
and
the
element
of
the
statute
that
we're
concerned
with
now
says
concerted
refusal
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
so
the
argument
is
made
that
the
handling
of
these
goods
by
virtue
of
the
hot
cargo
clause
has
been
removed
from
the
course
of
the
employer's
employment
and
therefore,
this
element
is
missing.
now,
i
suggest,
your
honors,
that
this
is
a
rather
artificial
interpretation
of
the
phrase
and
the
course
of
employment
as
it
appears
in
our
statute
and
that
it
suggest
that
goods
are
within
or
without
the
employer's
course
of
employment
depending
upon
one
day
they
may
be
fair
or
another
day
they
may
be
unfair.
the
simple
fact
is
that
congress
included
the
words
in
the
course
of
employment
in
this
statute
to
distinguish
between
refusals
by
employees
as
employees
to
handle
this
favored
goods
and
refusal
by
employees
as
members
of
the
consuming
public.
as
members
of
consuming
public
to
not
to
--
not
to
patronize
--
not
to
patronize
this
favored
employers
or
purchase
their
goods.
and
that
this
phrase
is
--
was
not
intended.
it's
a
rather
artificial
construction
seems
to
us
to
say
that
in
hot
cargo
clause
removes
the
handling
of
freight
which
is
normally
their
business,
normally
their
business
that
it
removes
it
from
their
course
of
their
employment.
now,
finally,
i
come
to
the
third
element.
the
third
element
of
the
violation
and
that
is
the
forcing
or
requiring
of
any
employer
or
the
person
to
cease
doing
business
with
someone
else.
the
union's
referring
to
the
statute
--
again,
once
more,
the
statute
says
that
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
induce
or
encourage
the
employer's
of
any
employer
to
engage
in
the
sympathetic
strikes.
then
down
to
subparagraph
(a)
on
page
66-4a
where
an
object
their
obvious
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
or
self-employed
--
skipped
a
couple
of
lines
--
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
or
other
person
to
cease
using,
selling,
handling,
transporting
or
otherwise
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
now,
the
unions
would
have
the
phrase
in
subparagraph
(4)
(a)
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
or
other
person
to
meet
that
employer.
that
is
the
employer
--
the
media
secondary
employer
whose
employees
are
out
--
are
engaging
in
this
sympathetic
work
stoppage.
now,
the
statute
--
the
statutory
phrase
is
not
limited
that
way.
it
says
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
or
other
person.
we
think
the
phrase
is
broad
enough
to
cover
not
only
the
immediate
secondary
employer
--
not
only
the
immediate
secondary
employer,
but
also
other
employers
who
will
be
forced
or
required
to
cease
doing
business
with
some
other
employer.
there
certainly
is
no
reason,
certainly
we're
not
required
to
read
that
phrase
as
narrowly
as
the
unions
--
as
the
unions
are
suggesting
in
this
case.
and
let
me
illustrate
what
i
mean.
in
the
case
which
follows
this
one.
the
secondary
employer
whose
employees
were
refusing
to
do,
handle
certain
work
on
certain
nonunion
doors,
in
turn
purchased
these
doors
from
a
local
intermediate
--
from
a
local
distributor.
the
local
distributor
in
turn
purchased
them
from
the
manufacturer
who
is
nonunion.
now,
while
it
might
be
said
that
the
immediate
secondary
employer
who
was
party
to
the
hot
cargo
agreement
was
not
being
forced
or
required
--
not
being
forced
or
required
to
cease
doing
business
with
anybody
since
he
had
presumably
consented
in
advance.
though
concerted
refusal
by
his
employees
would
force
the
intermediate
--
the
intermediate
local
distributor
to
cease
doing
business
not
only
with
the
contractor
of
this
action,
but
also
with
the
manufacturer
of
the
doors
of
the
other
end
and
certainly,
that
intermedia
distributor
was
as
much
of
a
neutral
person,
a
distinctive
person
as
congress
saw
it
as
the
--
as
an
immediate
secondary
employer
who
was
not
involved
in
the
dispute.
and
certainly,
we
think
that
congress
meant
to
protect
the
interest
of
those
employers
even
though
their
own
employees
were
not
engaging
in
some
strike
action,
meant
to
protect
their
interest
and
that
the
statutory
phrase,
the
comprehensive
phrase
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
is
satisfied
--
is
satisfied
when
you
have
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
if
the
employer
decides
not
to
do
business
with
someone
else,
that's
--
nothing
in
the
statute
about
that.
it
is
only
when
the
union
--
what
the
statute
prohibits
is
a
union
inducement
or
appeals
to
the
employees
of
a
secondary
employer
in
order
to
compel
him
or
some
other
person
to
cease
doing
business
with
the
chauffeurs
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
what
the
statute
prohibits,
that
very
thing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
but
it
--
the
statute
certainly
prohibits
--
certainly
prohibits
the
union
from
going
to
the
employees
and
put
aside
for
the
moment
the
hot
cargo
contract.
say
there
was
no
hot
cargo
clause
in
here
that
the
union
should
go
to
the
employees
of
the
secondary
employer
and
said,
"we
don't
want
you
to
handle
certain
goods."
that's
a
violation
of
the
statute,
a
clear
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
if
the
employer
eyes
only
without
any
pressure
from
the
union,
any
--
any
strike
pressure
from
the
union
decides
not
to
do
business
with
someone
else,
there's
nothing
that
we
can
do
about
that
under
our
statute.
and
even
in
the
case
where
the
employer
has
--
there
is
this
hot
cargo
clause
so
that
they
can
--
it
might
be
said
that
he
himself
as
in
advance
consented
to
his
employers
refusal
to
perform
services.
in
effect,
he's
agreed
in
advance
not
to
do
business,
not
to
do
business
with
an
employer
who
is
disfavored.
we
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
we
can
do
about
that
as
long
as
the
union
does
not
go
to
the
employee.
but
once
the
union
goes
to
the
employees,
that's
the
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
makes
no
qualification
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
conduct
where
there
is
a
hot
cargo
clause
in
effect.
now,
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
--
practically,
the
situation
arises
when
there
are
some
companies
on
--
maybe
on
strike
or
when
it's
good
to
maybe
a
nonunion
and
when
it's
good
to
arrive
on
the
scene.
for
example,
here
when
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
conceivably,
the
union
may
talk
to
the
employees
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
get
this
kind
of
a
contract
from
the
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
of
course,
undoubtedly,
the
union
will
inform
the
employees
immediately
after
the
execution
of
the
contract
what
they
have.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
there
is
--
at
stage
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
at
that
stage,
there's
been
no
inducement
or
encouragement
that
are
engaged
in
the
strike
action
for
concerted
refusal
to
handle
goods
and
that's
the
--
the
vital
thing
for
the
--
they
have
a
violation
on
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
all
it
may
have.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
all
it
may
have.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
may
do
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
well,
sometimes
they
don't.
sometimes
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i'm
not
slumping
it
all,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
not
slumping
at
all.
i
feel
that
i
am
limited
somewhat
by
my
client's
views
on
this.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
now,
let
me
add
further
to
continue
with
the
argument
that
this
statute
was
designed
--
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
protect
interest
of
those
of
the
immediate
secondary
employer.
i've
already
indicated
that
it
was
designed
to
protect
the
interest
of
secondary
and
other
secondary
employers
who
may
be
in
the
middle
between
the
primary
employer
and
the
secondary
employer
whose
employees
are
engaging
in
a
sympathetic
strike
action.
further,
we
think
that
congress
intended
to
protect
the
primary
employer,
the
fellow
who
is
directly
involved
in
a
dispute
with
this
union
and
his
employees
that
intended
to
protect
him
also.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
narrow
insofar
as
possible
with
few
exceptions
like
section
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
was
to
narrow
and
insofar
as
possibly
the
area
of
industrial
warfare
to
the
employer
who
is
immediately
involved
in
dispute
and
his
employers
of
the
union
representing
his
employees.
by
that
token,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
was
concerned
not
only
with
protecting
the
immediate
--
the
secondary
employer,
the
fellow
who
is
not
at
all
involved
in
the
dispute
but
also
deemed
it
unfair
to
the
primary
employer
to
subject
him
to
this
kind
of
--
to
these
secondary
pressures
in
order
to
compel
him
to
accept
the
union's
--
or
yield
to
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
have
said,
your
honor,
that
--
our
argument
may
very
well
point
in
that
direction,
but
i
can't
quite
go
that
far
with
--
with
you
because
the
limitations
that
i
feel
are
upon
the
point.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand
that.
now,
let
me
add
one
further
consideration
and
that
is
i've
mentioned
that
the
secondary
employers
are
protected,
primary
employers
also
is
intended
to
be
protected
against
this
unrestricted
warfare
and
finally,
of
course
and
perhaps
this
is
the
most
important
of
all
and
that
is
the
public
interest.
the
proponents
of
this
statute
felt
that
if
you
permitted
the
sympathetic
strike
actions
to
continue,
to
go
on
as
they
had
in
the
past
that
there
was
a
very
serious
danger.
senator
taft
expressed
this
fear
that
there
was
a
very
serious
danger
that
the
--
a
large
segment
of
the
economy
would
be
tied
up
by
the
sympathetic
strikes
of
course
to
the
detriment
of
the
public
at
large.
now,
senator
taft,
i
think
summed
up
what
we
have
set
forth
in
several
pages
of
our
brief,
of
contemporaneous
legislative
history,
legislative
history
during
the
period
that
this
bill
was
under
consideration.
he
summed
that
up
in
what
i
regard
as
a
very
up
sentence
sometime
in
1949
during
the
course
of
committee
hearings
on
administration
proposals
to
repeal
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
of
the
statute.
and
i
--
in
order
to
avoid
any
suggestion
that
i'm
using
post
legislative
history,
let
me
say
that
first
of
all,
this
is
senator
taft
who
i
think
can
be
said
to
speak
with
some
degree
of
assurance
as
to
what
the
statute
was
intended
and
finally
that
all
that
this
sentence
does
and
i'm
about
to
read
to
simply
summarize
very
handily
in
one
sentence
what
we
have
set
forth
over
three
or
four
pages
of
our
brief.
i'll
be
through
in
just
a
minute.
he
said,
speaking
of
the
hot
cargo,
the
secondary
--
rather
speaking
the
secondary
boycotts
and
what
he
thought
the
statute
--
the
evil
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
reach.
he
said
it
is
it,
the
secondary
boycott
is
certainly
is
an
attack
and
it
hits
right
and
left
any
number
of
people
and
the
public
who
haven't
got
the
slightest
interest
in
the
dispute
and
does
them
serious
financial
damage.
now,
i
think
if
we
have
a
right
to
propose,
if
we
have
right
in
these
considerations,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
unrealistic
suppose
that
congress
meant
intended
a
private
party,
a
private
party
to
deprive
these
other
interest,
the
interest
of
the
public,
the
interest
of
other
secondary
employers,
the
interest
of
the
primary
employer
to
deprive
them
of
the
protection
of
this
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
fundamentally
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
fundamentally
--
fundamentally,
your
honor,
the
argument
which
i've
made
here,
this
case
happens
to
involve
common
carriers.
the
argument
which
i
have
made
here
is
substantially
the
argument
which
we
also
make
in
connection
with
non-common
carriers.
there
is
this
additional
element
that
has
been
introduced
by
the
board's
decision
in
the
genuine
parts
case
which
came
down
after
this
--
after
this
cases
came
to
this
court
and
which
we
have
apprehended
to
our
brief.
in
the
genuine
parts
case
which
also
involved
a
common
carrier,
a
majority
of
the
board
took
the
position
that
these
contracts
are
against
--
are
invalid
to
begin
with,
are
invalid
to
begin
with
and
that
therefore
they
cannot
serve
to
justify
the
union's
action,
remove
the
union's
action
from
the
reach
of
the
statute.
now,
two
of
those
members
--
two
of
the
members
at
majority
felt
that
that
because
of
the
obligation
on
common
carriers
to
service
all
shippers
without
discrimination
that
the
common
carrier
couldn't
enter
this
kind
of
agreement,
the
third
member
of
the
majority
has
concluded.
he
concluded
in
these
cases
as
well
as
in
genuine
parts
that
these
contracts
generally
are
against
the
policy
of
the
statute
and
although
the
statute
does
reach
them
so
that
we
can
prevent
their
execution
or
compel
their
decision,
that
nevertheless,
they
are
against
the
policy
of
the
statute
and
that
they
employ
the
unions
no
protection.
now,
that
as
i
say,
is
the
view
of
one
member
at
this
majority.
now,
let
me
say
in
--
in
connection
with
that
that
recently,
the
icc
has
had
the
question
of
the
effect
of
these
hot
cargo
clauses
upon
the
shippers
obligation,
upon
the
carriers
obligation
to
a
shipper.
and
in
that
case,
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
held
that
these
hot
cargo
clauses
cannot
serve
to
excuse
the
carrier
from
his
obligation
with
respect
to
shippers,
to
serve
--
to
serve
shippers
and
the
situation
there
was
somewhat
like
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
now,
one
of
the
bases
of
the
arguments
that
the
union's
can
engage
in
this
kind
conduct
is
that
the
employer
--
it
is
not
unlawful
for
the
employer
and
the
union
to
get
together
and
for
the
employer
to
say,
"i
will
not
deal
with
so
and
so."
now,
at
least
with
respect
to
common
carriers
on
the
basis
of
the
icc's
decision,
that
basis
of
that
--
that
argument
of
the
union
is
gone
because
as
the
icc
views
it,
a
common
carrier
is
not
permitted
to
relieve
himself
of
his
duty
to
serve
shippers.
and
as
i
say
but
apart
from
that
and
i
will
conclude,
apart
from
that,
it
seems
to
us
that
one
of
these
contracts
are
legal
or
not
--
or
illegal,
the
hard
fact
is
--
the
hard
fact
is
that
this
statute
prohibits
union
inducement
without
any
qualifications
based
upon
the
existence
of
(inaudible).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that
may
well
be.
