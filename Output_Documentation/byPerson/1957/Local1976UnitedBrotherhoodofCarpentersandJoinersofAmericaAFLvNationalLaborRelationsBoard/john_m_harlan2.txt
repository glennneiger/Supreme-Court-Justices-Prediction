justice
john
m.
harlan
so
basically
your
position
is
that
the
search
is
designed
to
protect
the
public
rather
than
a
secondary
--
a
secondary
employer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
all
stands
to
it
--
it
comes
down
to
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
should
think
that
if
the
statute
is
designed
only
to
protect
the
secondary
employer,
you're
out
of
court
because
he
can
waive
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
the
same
token
that
it's
presented
--
if
it
is
intended
to
protect
the
public
generally
and
i
say
the
contract
is
bad.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you've
got
the
fisher
cut
bait
on
the
thing,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
maybe
not
in
this
proceeding
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
a
very
odd
position
that
seems
to
me
in
this
field
to
have
a
kind
of
unenforceable
contract.
justice
john
m.
harlan
hangs
in
limbo.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
you
shy
away
from
saying
that
the
contracts
against
public
policy
are
bad?
why
don't
you
put
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
are
you
reluctant
to
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
that
the
secondary
contractor
has
no
contract
with
the
primary
employer.
he
just
said,
"i
don't
want
to
do
business
with
you
anymore."
would
you
say
the
statute
prevents
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that,
but
when
the
secondary
employer
here
themselves
has
quit
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
it
add
to
the
--
what
does
it
add
to
the
problem
to
say
whether
the
union
--
why
can't
the
unions
encourage
the
employees
not
to
follow
the
instructions
of
their
employer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
question
is
whether
it
does.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
your
theory,
what
is
the
union
getting?
what
makes
a
cargo
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
getting
a
right,
an
unenforceable
right
to
hope
that
the
employer
is
going
to
be
--
could
support
enough
to
live
up
to
his
promise,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
all
it
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
a
kind
of
a
contract.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
argument
i
can
understand,
but
the
consequence
of
it
is
it
seems
to
me
the
contract
is
now
good.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
wouldn't
feel
free
to
express
your
own
point
of
view
as
a
lawyer.
that's
not
a
fair
question.
i
withdraw
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
they
usually
take
--
contain
the
qualification
that
this
agreement
does
which
provided
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
it
means
anything?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
recognition
as
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
we
can't
decide
then
you
got
the
statute
on
its
face
and
you
say
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
