that
you
consider
that

chief

but
what
is
your
position
as
to
whether
they
are
illegal
or
not?you
say
congress
did
outlaw
them.
now,
if
it
did
outlaw
them,
did
it
make
them
illegal?
chief

now,
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
this
kind
of
a

didn't
force
against
the
employees.
chief

have
--
aren't
those

well

not
--
