mr.
louis
p.
poulton
pleases
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
case
number
324
was
a
machinists
union
that
started
this
whole
thing,
the
dispute.
we
would
like
to
raise
two
defenses
to
the
board's
charges.
the
first
defense
that
we
would
raise
would
be
that
the
controversy
was
rendered
moot
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
and
secondly,
assuming
that
the
teamsters
can
rely
on
the
hot
cargo
clause
as
a
defense
to
their
actions,
we
would
contend
it
also
a
defense
to
our
action
although
we
are
not
the
contracting
union
to
the
contract
to
contain
the
hot
cargo
clause.
i'd
like
to
first
argue
to
mootness
argument,
if
i
might.
now,
the
facts
are
necessary
for
consideration
of
the
court
to
decide
whether
this
case
was
actually
rendered
moot
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
complaint.
now,
on
september
15,
1954,
the
machinists
union
which
represented
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
of
american
iron,
the
primary
employer,
to
engage
in
a
lawful
economic
strike
over
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now
during
the
strike,
american
iron
found
it
necessary
to
deliver
their
products
to
the
common
carriers
by
their
own
vehicles.
does
my
time
expire?
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
during
the
strike,
american
iron
delivered
these
goods
to
the
common
carriers
by
their
own
vehicle.
the
machinists
union
followed
these
trucks
to
the
various
common
carriers
docks
and
picket
them
in
a
u
shape
form
around
the
truck
while
the
truck
was
at
the
carriers
docks.contrary
to
the
statement
of
mr.
manoli,
the
union
did
not
picket
the
premises
of
the
common
carrier.
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
just
before
recess,
i
mentioned
that
the
machinists
union
raises
the
defense
of
mootness
if
the
court
should
decide
that
this
case
is
moot
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
go
into
the
second
defense
of
the
reliance
upon
the
hot
cargo
clause
in
the
teamsters'
contract.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
prior
to
noon
--
luncheon
recess,
on
september
15th,
1954,
the
machinists
union,
which
represented
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
of
the
american
iron
and
machine
works
company,
engaged
in
an
economic
dispute
over
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
employer.
and
as
i
said,
during
the
strike,
american
iron
found
it
necessary
to
deliver
its
products
to
the
common
carrier's
docks
by
means
of
its
own
vehicles.
and
the
machinists
pickets
follow
these
trucks
and
picket
them
in
a
u-shaped
form
at
the
common
carrier's
docks
and
only
while
they
were
at
the
docks.
when
the
truck
arrived,
the
pickets
would
picket
and
when
the
truck
left,
the
pickets
would
leave.
now,
due
to
this
activity
on
the
part
of
the
machinists,
american
iron
filed
a
charge
with
the
regional
director
for
the
16th
regional
board
on
september
24th,
1954
alleging
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
by
the
board,
the
regional
director
petitioned
the
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
oklahoma
seeking
a
temporary
--
a
preliminary
injunction
under
section
10
(l)
of
the
act.
this
petition
was
filed
on
october
the
11th,
1954.
the
case
was
heard
by
judge
wallace
and
it
is
known
as
civil
case
no.
6428
and
is
unrecorded.
the
case
was
tried
and
heard
on
october
16th,
1954,
which
time
judge
wallace
dismissed
the
petition
for
the
preliminary
injunction.
now,
on
october
the
21st,
1954,
american
iron
and
the
machinists
signed
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
thereby
settling
the
underlying
dispute.
this
agreement
contained
a
no-strike
clause
and
was
for
the
period
of
two
years,
all
picketing
by
the
machinists
ceased
on
october
21st,
1954.
now,
two
days
after
the
underlying
dispute
was
completely
settled,
the
complaint
was
issued
by
the
regional
director.
we
contend
that
by
issuing
this
complaint
after
the
dispute
had
been
settled,
the
regional
director
clearly
abused
his
discretion
since
the
controversy
was
rendered
moot.
now,
this
court
--
first,
let
me
say
that
the
question
of
mootness
is
not
raised
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
the
question
was
originally
raised
before
the
trial
examiner
at
the
original
hearing
in
the
case.
it
was
raised
by
way
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
the
controversy
was
rendered
moot.
this
motion
was
denied.
it
was
again
reinstated
before
the
trial
examiner
and
has
been
preserved
all
the
way
through
to
this
court.
the
court
of
--
the
board
did
not
precisely
rule
on
the
question
of
mootness
but
rather
accepted
the
trial
examiner's
intermediate
report
as
to
this
aspect.
now,
the
trial
examiner's
intermediate
report
merely
stated
this
and
i'd
like
to
quote
from
its
record,
page
31,
“the
undersigned
finds
that
these
developments,
that
was
the
signing
of
the
contract,
had
not
rendered
the
present
proceeding
moot,
orders
dealing
with
unfair
labor
practices
have
preventative
as
well
as
remedial
purpose
in
effect.”
the
voluntary
cessation
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
private
agreements
for
their
end,
do
not
deprive
the
board
of
its
power
to
add
the
sanction
of
a
board
order
and
the
possibly
--
possible
enforcement
proceedings
in
order
to
bar
any
recurrence
of
those
practices.
the
petitioner
in
324,
machinists
moved
the
board,
reconsider
their
decision
and
order
on
the
grounds
that
the
controversy
was
rendered
moot
and
that
they
had
not
decided
that
issue.
this
was
summarily
denied.
now,
this
court,
in
united
states
versus
w.
t.
grant
company,
345
u.s.
629
at
page
633,
stated
in
a
question
involving
a
violation
of
the
clayton
act
whether
that
violation
had
been
rendered
moot,
and
i
quote,
“if
the
moving
party
must
satisfy
the
court,
a
relief
is
needed.”
the
necessary
determination
is
that
there
exists
some
cognizable
danger
of
recurrent
violation,
something
more
than
the
mere
possibility
which
serves
to
keep
the
case
alive.
and
we
contend
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
recurrence
of
the
violation
since
the
contract
had
settled
the
underlying
dispute.
and
this
court
in
local
74,
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
&
joiners
of
america
versus
national
labor
relations
board,
341
u.s.
707
at
page
715.
now
this
case,
i'd
like
to
go
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
case
involved
a
secondary
boycott
by
the
carpenters
union
of
a
renovation
project.
now,
the
renovation
project
was
completed.
prior
to
that,
there
was
a
charge
filed
for
by
the
--
i
think
it
was
the
employer
if
i'm
not
mistaken
because
of
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
now,
the
carpenters
raised
the
question
of
mootness
whether
the
completion
of
the
renovation
project
had
rendered
the
controversy
moot.
this
court
stated
and
i
quote
again,
“this
case
has
not
become
moot
by
the
completion
of
the
renovation
project.”
the
complaint
was
against
petitioners'
use
of
secondary
pressure
upon
watsons,
and
that
was
the
construction
project
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
the
statute.
the
use
of
such
pressure
on
this
renovation
project
was
merely
a
sample
of
what
might
be
repeated
elsewhere
if
not
prohibited.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
the
underlying
dispute
between
petitioners
and
watsons
has
not
shown
to
have
been
resolved.
now
in
this
case,
we
contend
that
the
underlying
dispute
has
been
completely
resolved.
the
dispute
which
gave
rise
to
the
picketing
of
machinists
was
the
economic
strike
over
the
terms
of
the
contract.
that
dispute
had
been
settled
prior,
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
complaint.
now,
the
board
cites
various
cases
--
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
yes,
sir.
the
contract
was
completely
negotiated
and
was
a
new
contract,
sir,
for
a
period
of
two
years.
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
what
clause
were
you
referring
to,
sir?
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
the
hot
cargo
clause,
sir?
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
let
me
--
let
me
say
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
hot
cargo
clause
was
not
in
the
machinists
contract,
sir.
it
was
in
the
contract
between
the
teamsters
and
the
common
carriers.
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
now,
the
board
cites
various
cases
to
support
its
theory
that
this
controversy
was
not
rendered
moot.
i
merely
like
to
point
out
in
the
cases
cited
by
the
board,
there
were
no
factual
situations
where
the
controversy
had
been
rendered
moot
prior
to
the
settlement
--
have
been
rendered
moot
by
a
settlement
of
the
underlying
dispute
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
complaint.
this
case,
we
feel,
falls
into
the
dictum
in
the
carpenters
case
and
we
feel
the
board
and
the
general
counsel
abused
its
discretion
by
issuing
a
complaint
two
days
after
the
underlying
dispute
had
been
settled.
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
yes,
sir.
it
was.
mr.
louis
p.
poulton
no,
sir.
they
did
not.
i'd
like
to
explain
it
if
i
may,
sir.
the
contract
between
the
teamsters
contains
the
hot
cargo
clause
and
that
was
what
the
violation,
as
i
understand,
section
8
(b)
(4)
was
predicated
upon
against
the
teamsters.
that
dispute
had
not
been
settled.
they
still
had
that
clause
in
their
contracts,
sir.
therefore,
their
case
would
not
be
rendered
moot
and
they
did
not
raise
that
contention.
now,
i
like
to
now
turn
to
the
hot
cargo
agreement,
the
machinists
reliance
thereupon.
we,
of
course,
will
adapt
the
teamsters'
position
that
the
clause
is
legal
and
enforceable
by
direct
inducement
of
the
secondary
employees.
the
courts
below
in
the
rabouin
case,
crowley
milk
case,
and
in
this
case
itself,
found
that
the
hot
cargo
clause
removes
the
elements
necessary
to
a
finding
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
against
the
teamsters.
now,
if
the
clause
itself
removes
the
elements
necessary
to
a
finding
of
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
it
removes
the
elements
not
only
as
to
the
teamsters
but
as
to
whatever
union
is
enthusing
the
secondary
employees.
there
have
been
three
courts
at
the
present
time
that
have
considered
the
precise
question
of
whether
a
union
which
is
not
a
party
to
the
contract
containing
hot
cargo
clause
may
use
the
hot
cargo
clause
as
a
defense,
one
court
being
the
court
below
in
this
case
which
by
a
divided
decision
found
that
the
clause
was
not
available
to
the
machinists
union,
although
judge
washington
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
found
that
the
clause
was
available
as
well
to
the
machinists
as
it
was
to
the
teamsters.
and
he
stated
it
made
no
difference
as
to
who
was
doing
the
enthusing,
whether
it
was
the
teamsters
or
the
machinists.
now,
also
in
this
case
in
the
10
(l)
proceedings,
the
same
precise
question
was
before
judge
wallace.
judge
wallace
summarily,
i
might
say,
denied
the
petitions
for
injunction
and
therefore
we
contend
that
he
also
found
or
that
he
found
that
the
hot
cargo
clause
was
available
to
the
machinists
as
a
defense.
now,
the
third
court
which
considered
the
contention
was
the
district
court
in
united
states
district
court
for
southern
district
of
new
york.
in
dallas
versus
teamsters,
local
707
in
1205,
the
district
judge
concluded
that
the
hot
cargo
clause
was
not
a
defense
as
to
a
non-contracting
union.
he
found
it
on
the
basis
that
the
contracting
union,
pursuant
to
the
actual
language
of
the
clause,
reserves
the
right
to
apply
the
clause.
the
right
was
reserved.
therefore,
he
found
that
until
the
contracting
union
actually
exercised
its
rights
under
the
clause,
it
was
not
a
defense
to
a
non-contracting
union.
and
when
i
say
non-contracting
union,
i
mean
a
union
that
is
not
a
party
to
the
hot
cargo
clause.
now,
that
case
can
clearly
be
distinguished
and
i
think
we
can
--
a
petitioner
in
324
can
cite
that
as
authority
for
our
case
in
support
of
our
contention
that
we
can
rely
upon
this
hot
cargo
clause,
since
the
clause
in
the
present
case
says
that
the
employees
shall
not
be
allowed,
shall
not
be
allowed
to
handle
hot
goods.
there
is
no
necessity
on
the
part
of
the
contracting
union
to
exercise
an
option.
there's
no
option
given
to
them.
so
therefore,
we
contend
that
if
the
same
factual
report,
the
district
court,
the
same
clause
it
would
have
decided
that
the
handling
of
struck
goods
was
removed
from
the
course
of
the
secondary
employee's
employment
and
the
clause
was
available
to
a
non-contracting
union
as
a
defense.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
something
else
that
the
circuit
court
in
this
case
--
first
i'd
like
to
say
this,
i'd
say
the
board
did
not
pass
on
this
precise
question
of
whether
the
defense
was
available
to
the
machinists
because
they
found
that
the
defense
was
not
available
to
the
teamsters
union
therefore,
automatically
they
found
it
wasn't
available
to
the
machinists.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
i
said
by
divided
decision,
found
that
the
clause
was
not
available
and
they
found
it
on
these
grounds,
that
the
machinists
union
was
neither
the
contracting
union
did
not
hold
the
contract
containing
hot
cargo
clause
nor
where
we
--
third-party
beneficiary.
well,
we
will
concede
in
any
strict
contractual
sense
we
were
neither
--
we
cannot
deny
that
we
were
not
the
contracting
party,
but
in
a
strict
contractual
sense,
we
were
not
a
third-party
beneficiary
to
the
hot
cargo
clause.
however,
the
clause
was
made
for
the
benefit
of
another
union
other
than
the
contracting
union
since
the
clause
would
be
valueless
to
the
contracting
union.
they
would
have
no
need
for
the
clause.
it
was
made
for
the
sole
purpose
of
helping
either
sister
locals
of
the
teamsters
or
other
labor
unions
that
were
caught
in
the
throes
of
a
strike.
in
summing
up,
i
would
like
to
say
just
this
that
first
--
our
first
contention
is
the
case
was
rendered
moot
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
and
we
think
the
board
and
general
counsel
abused
its
discretion
by
issuing
the
complaint
because
of
the
mootness.
and
secondly,
we
would
like
to
say
that
if
the
teamsters
conduct
is
permissive
and
the
hot
cargo
clause
is
legal
and
enforceable
by
direct
inducement
of
the
secondary
employees,
then
we
feel
that
the
clause
is
equally
a
defense
to
the
machinists
contract.
i
thank
you.
