justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
what
circumstances
are
they
enforceable
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
mean,
on
the
board's
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
board's
position,
are
there
any
circumstances
in
which
they
might
be
enforced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
mean
by
that
that
if
the
employer
agrees
then
that
the
bound
by
the
bars,
the
employer
may
refuse
to
handle
and
the
employee's
may
refuse
to
handle.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
that
circumstance,
there'd
be
no
violation
of
any
kind
to
the
employee's
view?
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
get
this,
mr.
manoli.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
for
example
there
is
one
of
these
clauses
and
the
employee's
of
their
own
volition
because
there
is
such
a
clause
that
says
if
they
need
not
handle
these
goods,
do
not
handle
the
goods.
i
gather
the
board's
position
is
that
there's
nothing
the
board
can
do
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
there
representative
should
meet
with
them
and
say,
we
have
this
contract
with
your
employer
and
you
obey
the
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
are
hot
goods.
don't
handle
them.
then
you
say
the
board
can
reach
the
union.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
in
to
that,
mr.
manoli.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
concerted
refusal
has
reference
to
a
concert
of
who
with
whom.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
manoli,
you
say
when
the
union
goes
to
the
employee,
what
time
does
this
--
does
that
relate,
to
a
time
does
that
relate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
suppose
i
take
it
that
the
--
where
you
have
one
of
these
clauses
in
the
contract,
the
hot
cargo
clause
and
the
contract
with
the
secondary
employer
with
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
union
have
anything
to
do
going
to
the
employees
at
that
time
to
have
the
clause
included
in
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
practical
practice,
of
course
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
there
would
be
some
situations
in
which
there'd
be
no
contract
until
the
employees
at
first
approved
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
i
suppose
the
negotiators
of
the
contract
that
is
their
representatives.
the
employee's
representatives
can
do
something
about
persuading
the
employees
that
a
hot
cargo
clause
in
their
agreement,
it's
a
good
thing
for
them
to
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
violation
at
that
stage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
would
it
mean
this
as
a
practical
matter
that
if
the
secondary
employer
has
a
construction
contract
and
he
has
to
buy
doors
that
he'd
be
very
careful
not
to
patronize
any
suppliers
of
doors
unless
they
make
doors
that
his
employees
would
handle,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
probably
does,
doesn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
of
this
--
all
of
this
goes
to
the
public
policy
considerations
that
i
think
you
rather
slump
off
too
lightly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
shouldn't
say
you
are,
perhaps
that's
your
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forcing
or
requiring,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
complaint
--
was
that
complaint
also
against
the
teamsters?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
--
did
they
join
your
mootness
contention?
