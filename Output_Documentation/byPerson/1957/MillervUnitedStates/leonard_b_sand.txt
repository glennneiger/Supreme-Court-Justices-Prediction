mr.
leonard
b.
sand
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
court
has
--
has
noted
what
is
the
reasonable
search
and
seizure
is
not
to
be
determined
by
any
fixed
formula.
one
has
to
look
carefully
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case.
and
to
this,
with
respect
to
the
fact
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
was
a
paraphrase
--
there
was
a
paraphrase
of
--
of
language
of
this
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
areas
or
the
crucial
areas
of
difference
between
counsel
for
a
petitioner
and
for
the
government
relate
to
the
facts
in
this
case
rather
than
to
the
abstract
principles
of
--
of
law
which
--
which
may
apply
and
therefore,
i'd
like
to
outline
those
facts.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
errors
of
omission,
very
serious
error
of
omission
particularly
with
respect
to
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
record
concerning
a
notification
by
the
officers
as
to
their
purpose
in
seeking
entry.
i
have
reference
to
the
testimony
at
page
29
where
the
officer
testified.
he
said
--
well,
i
--
i'll
address
myself
directly
to
that
--
that
incident
although
it
occurred
somewhat
in
--
in
the
middle
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
at
page
29.
now,
this
is
the
testimony
at
the
trial.
agent
wilson
is
relating
what
occurred
when
he
sought
entry
into
petitioner's
apartment.
this
is
after
not
being
him
sayung,
"police!
open
the
door!"
and
then
about
three
quarters
of
the
way
down
the
page,
the
question
is
asked
what
happened
then?
he
said,
“what
do
you
all
want?”
and
he
says
“police!
you
are
under
arrest.
we
want
in.”
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i'm
reading
from
page
99
of
the
record?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
99
--
oh
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
page
99
of
the
--
of
the
record.
and
that
three
quarters
of
the
way
down
the
page,
he
said,
“what
do
you
all
want?”
and
he
says
“police!
you
are
under
arrest.
we
want
in.”
he
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
let
us
in
or
something
like
that.
and
so,
officer
wurms
took
a
hold
at
the
door
and
pulled
it
open.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
understood
the
contention
to
be
made
that
--
that
blue
had
asked,
“what
do
you
want?”
and
that
there
was
no
answer,
i
suggest
that
--
that
the
--
the
testimony
indicates
--
at
least,
a
testimony
at
the
trial
indicates
that
there
was
an
explicit
statement
by
the
officer
that
the
purpose
for
which
they
sought
entry
into
the
apartment
was
to
arrest
the
petitioner.
and
so,
we
concede
that
before
there
can
be
an
entry
based
on
--
on
probable
cause
with
the
use
of
force
that
there
must
consist
with
the
common
law,
the
--
an
identification
by
the
officers
and
an
announcement
of
the
purpose.
we
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
it's
true
that
--
that
it's
not
entirely
clear.
obviously,
all
these
took
place
within
a
--
a
matter
of
seconds.
agent
wilson
and
officer
wurms
have
had
previous
contact
with
miller
and
with
byrd
in
connection
with
--
with
past
narcotics
violations.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
to
that
--
there's
--
there
is
also
no
evidence,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
it
--
that
it
was
not
heard.
obviously,
miller
heard
the
knock
on
the
door.
he
said,
“what
do
you
want?”
so
that
--
so
that
there
was
somebody
at
the
other
side
either
two
of
them
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
yes.
we
think
that
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
think
there
has
to
be
a
--
a
sufficient
communication
to
the
person
against
whose
will,
entry
is
sought
so
that
he
knows
that
--
that
persons
who
are
law
enforcement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
were
justified
in
seeking
the
entry
and
that
the
amount
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
defendant.
i
--
i
would
think
that
the
government
can't
prove
the
negative.
the
government
can't
prove
that
the
defendant
did
not
hear
this.
there
was
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress
in
this
case,
if
the
defendant
had
full
opportunity
to
testify
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
and
if
he
did
not
hear
this,
he
--
he
could
have
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
oh,
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
which
was
before
the
trial.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
there
was
sufficient
evidence
before
the
judge
on
the
hearing,
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
this
--
the
passage
on
page
99
as
--
as
i
pointed
out,
was
at
the
trial.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
and
that
appeared
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
--
yes,
i
--
i
think
you
can
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
to
the
extent
that
i
rely
on
the
testimony
at
--
at
page
99
of
the
record,
i'm
doing
that
and
in
the
carroll
case,
this
court
said
that
in
passing
upon
a
motion
to
suppress,
when
we
look
at
--
at
all
the
testimony
including
the
testimony
adduced
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
not
merely
the
testimony
which
was
adduced
at
the
hearing.
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
on
that
strength
of
--
of
that
ruling
by
this
court
that
i
make
reference
to
the
testimony
at
page
99
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
of
the
record.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
he
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
at
the
hearing.
now,
there
was
a
hearing.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
oh,
yes,
which
we
do.
he
--
he
made
what
i
suppose
amounts
to
--
to
an
oral
opinion.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
that
would
be
at
the
conclusion
of
the
--
the
motion
to
suppress
and
that
would
be
on
pages
31
and
--
and
32
of
the
--
the
record.
in
--
in
essence,
what
he
--
what
he
--
judge
holtzoff
says
there
is
--
is
that
the
probable
cause
existed
and
on
the
basis
of
the
existence
of
probable
cause,
he
denied
the
motion
to
--
to
suppress.
the
focus
and
i
think
the
reason
why
this
testimony
at
--
at
page
99
was
not
brought
out
as
--
as
i
shall
show
in
the
moment,
at
the
--
at
the
hearing
and
the
motion
to
suppress
was
then
the
--
the
issue
was
focused
on
the
question
of
--
of
probable
cause.
no
reference
was
--
was
made
to
the
--
to
the
statute
which
passed
some
light
on
the
--
on
the
obligations
of
the
police
officers.
i
think
--
i
think
it
--
the
fact
that
miller
and
wurms
had
previous
contact
--
excuse
me,
that
officer
wilson
and
wurms
had
previous
contact
with
miller
is
significant
in
trying
to
evaluate
just
what
it
is
that
took
place
within
the
--
within
the
few
seconds
when
the
store
was
opened
and
--
and
then
an
attempt
was
made
to
--
to
close
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
i
--
i
would
like
to
do
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
i
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
i
intended
to
begin
in
that
way
and
--
and
did
not.
i
--
i
think
there
are
three
questions
in
this
case,
one
is
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
which
the
counsel
of
petitioner
does
not
concede,
but
does
not
press.
the
--
the
other
question
relates
to
the
mode
of
entry
into
the
apartment.
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
notification
of
identity
and
purpose
before
the
use
of
the
minimal
amount
of
force
which
was
--
which
was
used
in
this
case,
and
the
third
relates
to
--
to
the
search
which
was
made
--
which
the
government
supports
as
being
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
those
are
the
three
questions
in
the
case
and
as
i
--
as
petitioner
does
not
strenuously
press
the
question
of
--
of
probable
cause,
i
--
i
will
not
belabor
it.
i
would,
however,
like
to
point
out
the
fact
which
--
which
has
not
been
--
as
yet
called
to
this
court's
attention
and
that
is
that
shepherd,
the
--
the
runner
for
miller,
the
man
who
--
who
was
the
contact
with
reed,
was
the
brother
of
the
codefendant,
byrd,
and
the
testimony
is
that
he
could
generally
be
located
at
petitioner's,
mother's
house.
now,
i
think
that
this
is
significant
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
conduct
of
the
officers
who
sought
to
make
the
entry
at
--
at
4:00
a.m.,
in
the
morning,
without
a
warrant.
because
having
arrested
reed
and
then
shepherd
and
in
the
light
of
this
relationship
between
shepherd
and
--
and
petitioner,
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
had
they
not
immediately
sought
to
arrest
miller,
he
would've
learned
by
virtue
of
this
relationship
or
perhaps
the
general
jailhouse
grapevine.
he
would've
learned
that
the
narcotics
officers
had
detected
the
operation
of
this
--
of
this
group.
and
so,
when
that
fact
is
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
officers
first
learned
to
visit
1:35
in
the
morning
and
that
everything
which
takes
place
in
this
--
in
this
case
took
place
within
the
interval
between
1:35
and
4:00
a.m.,
in
the
morning,
i
think
that
it
it's
apparent
that
the
officers
were
acting
not
only
reasonably,
but
under
the
present
of
circumstances.
there
was
--
there
was
a
necessity
for
them
to
affect
the
arrest
immediately.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
smiled,
mr.
justice.
no.
on
the
contrary,
i
smiled
because
i
--
i
had
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
same
difficulties
with
the
district
of
columbia
code
that
--
that
you
have
had.
and
the
answer,
i
think,
is
contained
in
the
cases
which
are
cited
on
--
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
in
essence,
the
desolation
of
it
is
that
the
law
of
arrest
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
common
law
--
law
of
arrest.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
dealing
with
the
matter
of
district
of
columbia
law,
reaches
the
result
that
--
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
it
--
it
appears
that
it
was
from
the
building
that
the
petitioner
made
the
sale
of
narcotics.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
obviously,
some
of
the
--
there
were
overt
acts
committed
in
the
building,
but
the
district
of
columbia
code
is
obviously
anachronistic
in
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
the
fact
that
--
that
what
took
place
--
took
place
in
the
building
is
--
is
of
a
peculiar
significance
here,
because
this
is
not
the
sort
of
case,
where
agents
having
cause
to
arrest
a
defendant,
trail
them
and
wait
until
he
gets
into
his
apartment.
and
i
think
when
the
facts
are
of
that
nature,
then
they
called
to
close
scrutiny
as
to
whether
the
arrest
was
a
subterfuge
for
a
search,
but
here
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
i
was
addressing
myself
to
--
to
the
different
point
and
that
is
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
search,
because
i
think
what's
significant
here
is
not
merely
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
petitioner
and
the
fact
that
that
arrest
had
to
be
made
promptly.
but
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
in
the
apartment
which
is
the
--
the
only
place
where
a
petitioner
could
be
found
immediately
after
that
probable
cause
arose.
and
the
place
from
which
petitioner
had
in
fact
committed
the
crime.
so,
i
think,
there
was
no
reasonable
suggestion
in
the
facts
in
this
case
that
the
arrest
was
--
was
a
pretext
for
the
search.
and
in
fact,
it
--
it
would
--
the
petitioner
was
arrested
and
the
only
place
he
could've
been
--
been
arrested.
so,
that
i
--
i
think
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
it
was
a
--
a
necessity
to
arrest
him
immediately.
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
them
in
the
apartment
and
from
the
facts
which
the
agents
knew
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
marked
money
was
in
the
--
in
the
apartment
and
that
there
might
very
well
be
additional
narcotics
in
the
apartment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
is
true
that
that
does
not
necessarily
follow.
i
attempted
to
--
to
deal
with
the
facts
chronologically
because
frequently,
the
government
is
accused
in
search
and
seizure
case
of
attempting
to
justify
the
arrest
or
the
--
or
the
entry
on
the
basis
of
what
the
search
uncovers.
therefore,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
situation
as
it
confronted
the
officers
at
the
various
times
they
took
the
steps
they
did.
and
we
--
we
come
then,
i
think,
to
the
point
at
which
the
officers
are
outside
the
door
of
petitioner's
apartment,
at
4:00
a.m.,
in
the
morning,
having
probable
cause
to
believe
the
things
i've
--
i've
just
stated
and
the
necessity
to
--
to
act
promptly.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
that
there
are
--
this
requires
a
brief
description
of
the
physical
properties
of
this
building
and
--
and
is
fairly
typical
with
--
with
--
in
new
york
we
call
brownstone
buildings,
i
don't
know
what
the
term
is,
general.
there
are
two
--
two
ways
by
which
you
can
gain
access
to
the
basement
apartment.
one
is
through
an
open
staircase,
which
leads
directly
down
to
the
basement
and
that
is
the
roof
which
was
taken
by
agent
wilson
and
(inaudible)
other
of
the
officers
there.
there
is
a
second
way
by
which
you
can
gain
access
to
that
basement
and
that
is
through
the
first
floor
at
the
level
above
the
basement
apartment
and
that
is
the
roof
which
one
of
the
officers,
officer
wurms
took,
and
he
went
and
he
opened
a
doorway
using
a
skeleton
key
which
lead
only
to
a
stairway
and
that
stairway
went
down
into
the
furnace
room
and
he
went
to
the
furnace
room
to
the
door
of
the
furnace
room,
at
which
point,
he
came
out
in
the
hallway,
the
very
same
hallway
he
would've
been
had
he
come
down
the
open
staircase
from
--
from
the
outside,
the
same
room
which
was
taken
by
the
other
--
the
other
officers.
the
record
isn't
explicit
as
to
why
he
took
this
route,
but
there
are
some
reasons
in
the
record
to
believe
that
this
was
to
prevent
any
possible
escape
through
--
through
a
backdoor,
had
there
been
a
backdoor.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
entry
was
made
into
petitioner's
apartment,
officer
wurms
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
with
--
with
the
other
officers
who
--
who
came
down
the
--
the
front
stairs.
and
so,
in
relation
to
the
petitioner,
the
fact
that
he
took
this
--
this
ultimate
route,
the
government
feels
is
--
is
without
significance.
and
so
--
and
so
all
the
officers
are
standing
outside
the
door
to
petitioner's
apartment
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
well,
i
don't
consider
it
a
--
a
breaking
in
or
a
trespass
with
relation
to
petitioner.
this
was
an
entry
into
a
common
stairway
and
--
and
into
a
furnace
room.
after
he
went
through
the
--
the
common
stairway
and
to
the
furnace
room,
he
was
then
in
the
hallway
and
he
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
--
as
where
the
--
where
the
other
officers.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
when
--
when
agent
wilson
first
observed
shepherd
go
down
the
basement
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
he
--
he
followed
down
--
he
followed
down
the
stairs
and
looked
in
the
hallway
and
there
are
two
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
agent
wilson
is
--
is
following
shepherd,
the
runner,
who
has
gone
down
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
in
the
basement
and
there
are
--
there
are
three
doors
as
--
as
counsel
of
the
petitioner
stated.
one
is
the
door
at
which
--
which
just
leads
to
the
entrance
and
that
was
open.
there
were
two
doors,
one
of
which
leads
to
the
furnace
room
and
one
of
which
leads
to
petitioner's
apartment.
nobody
was
in
the
hallway.
the
inference
being
inescapable
that
shepherd
went
either
into
the
furnace
room
or
into
petitioner's
apartment.
agent
wilson
then
ascended
the
stairs
and
crossed
the
street.
he
then
saw
a
light
go
on
for
the
first
time
in
the
furnace
room.
it
went
off
and
then
some
moments
later,
shepard
came
out.
he
had
a
taxicab
waiting
all
this
time.
i
think
the
entrance
that
--
that
shepard
had
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
is
no
evidence,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
any
search
was
made.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
he
went
there,
i
think,
and
the
--
and
the
record
is
not
--
not
too
clear
on
this.
i
think
he
went
to
preclude
the
possibility
that
miller
would
escape
through
some
--
through
some
backdoor,
some
other
exit.
the
--
the
officer
is
not
--
not
being
in
--
familiar
with
--
with
the
premises.
not
having
--
not
having
previously
searched
the
premises.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
is
this
interval
between
the
--
between
the
time
that
shepherd
goes
down
the
stairs
and
the
--
and
the
time
the
light
goes
on
in
the
furnace
room
is
significant
because
i
think
in
that
interval,
it's
clear
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
furnace
room.
and
so,
petitioner
--
and
so,
shepard
must
have
gone
into
petitioner's
apartment.
i
think
it's
a
fact
which
fortified
the
existence
of
a
--
a
probable
cause.
and
i
think
for
purposes
of
completion,
i
--
i
--
completeness
i
should
state
that
--
that
they
were
subsequently
found
in
the
furnace
room,
381
capsules
of
heroin
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
judge
youngdahl,
dismissed
the
counts
that
were
predicated
on
that,
because
he
thought
that
the
government
had
not
sufficiently
proved
possession
of
the
--
of
the
--
possession
control
of
the
furnace
room
by
--
by
petitioner
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
accepting
that,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
entry
into
the
furnace
room
which
was
a
common
area
was
a
search
affected
as
the
result
of
--
of
an
illegal
entry.
this
--
this
case
is
--
is
different
from
the
mcdonald
case,
where
without
the
existence
of
probable
cause,
law
enforcement
agents
entered
an
occupied
bedroom
apartment.
i
--
i
think
the
facts
are
--
are
entirely
different.
with
--
with
respect
to
the
means
by
which
the
officers,
all
of
the
officers,
including
officer
wurms,
who
--
who
came
down
from
the
furnace
room
gained
access
to
petitioner's
apartment.
the
testimony
that
appears
at
--
at
page
27
of
the
record
is
that
after
the
officers
said,
"blue,
police!"
he,
meaning
miller,
opened
the
door
slightly.
it
was
on
a
chain.
he
took
one
look
at
me
and
tried
to
slam
the
door
at
which
time
i
grabbed
the
door
and
opened
it.
“did
you
know
this
person,
blue,
who
opened
the
door?”
“yes.”
“how
did
you
know
him?”
“previous
knowledge,
i
have
seen
him
before.”
the
majority
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
reading
the
--
the
record
and
there
are
other
passages
in
the
record
which
are
--
which
are
consistent
with
--
with
that,
said
that
upon
the
sum
total
of
what
must
have
flashed
through
his,
miller's
mind,
that
he
recognized
the
officers
instantly
as
the
narcotic
squad
may
fairly
may
inferred.
and
--
and
we
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
record
does
--
does
support
that
inference.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
inference
that
--
that
miller
having
been
told,
"police."
having
them
told
that
the
testimony
as
--
as
the
trial
indicates,
“you
are
under
arrest.
we
want
in.”
when
he
opened
the
door
and
he
saw
the
members
of
the
narcotics
squad
with
whom
he
had
previous
contact
before
him.
they
were
sufficiently
communicated
to
him,
the
fact
that
these
people
who
were
outside
his
door,
the
law
enforcement
officials
who
sought
entry
into
his
apartment
for
purposes
of
arresting
him.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
testimony
--
the
--
the
passage
which
i
--
which
i
have
just
read,
of
course,
is
testimony
by
the
officer
who
--
who
sought
entry
that
he
had
--
had
previous
knowledge
with
--
in
connection
with
the
narcotics
violation
on
the
part
of
miller.
i
--
i
think
it
appears
at
page
27
of
the
--
of
the
record.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
basis
for
the
court's
exclusion
was
that
--
that
--
he
excluded
the
question
because
of
the
--
the
premise
in
it
that
there
was
a
necessity
to
--
to
obtain
a
--
a
warrant
and
he
excluded
the
question
because
probable
cause
existing.
there
was
as
--
as
the
rule
of
no
necessity
to
obtain
the
warrant.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
oh,
well,
that
they
were
--
that
the
other
testimony
indicates
that
--
that
defense
counsel
were
afforded
the
opportunity
--
was
afforded
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
there
was
no
restriction
of
the
latitude
apart
from
this
question
which
was
improper
as
to
form.
there
was
no
restriction
of
the
latitude
of
the
--
of
defense
counsel
at
the
--
at
the
hearing
and
there
was
--
there
was
inquiry
in
the
cross-examination
of
wilson
as
to
the
extent
of
his
previous
contacts
with
miller
and
i
think
that
this
one
--
one
objection
is
properly
sustained
because
the
question
was
--
was
improper
as
to
form.
i
--
i
don't
know
that
the
defense
counsel,
the
counsel
for
petitioner
contending
that
they
were
unduly
restricted
at
the
--
the
hearing
on
the
--
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
also,
at
page
--
at
page
16
of
the
--
of
the
record,
if
--
if
the
court
please,
or
officer
--
another
officer
is
accounting
the
--
the
same
events
and
he
is
saying
that
he
said
in
low
voice,
“police.”
and
the
door
was
opened
slowly.
“who
is
the
man
who
looked
around
the
door?”
“william
miller.”
“was
he
known
to
you?”
“yes,
sir.”
“is
that
the
same
william
miller
that
you
have
previously
known
in
connection
with
the
narcotics
case?”
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
but
it's
--
it
creates
--
it
--
there
is
a
--
an
inference
which
can
be
drawn
and
if,
in
fact,
miller
did
not
know
him,
this
was
without
a
jury
that
he
had
full
opportunity
to
state
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
the
testimony,
he
took
one
look
at
me
and
tried
to
slam
the
door,
supports
that
inference.
i
think
almost
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
police
--
when
--
when
he
said
(voice

--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
page
27.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
testimony
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
but
with
--
with
respect
to
that,
when
the
testimony
at
the
trial,
i
--
i
think
it
what
occurred
that
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
entire
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
excerpts
from
which
your
honor
had
just
had
reference
to.
that
the
primary
attack
was
based
on
the
question
of
probable
cause,
and
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
focus
was
on
that
question.
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
when
their
testimony
at
--
came
out,
at
--
at
greater
detail
of
the
trial,
as
appears
at
--
at
99
of
the
record,
“police!
you
are
under
arrest.
we
want
in.”
that
no
attempt
was
made
by
counsel
for
petitioner
to
--
to
cross-examine
with
respect
to
--
to
any
inconsistency
and
as
i
say
under
the
carroll
case,
this
court
has
said
that
in
determining
the
propriety
of
the
ruling
and
a
motion
to
suppress,
one
may
--
one
may
look
at
--
at
all
the
testimony
including
that
adduced
at
the
trial.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
--
with
a
question
of
--
of
fact.
what,
in
fact,
occurred
within
the
few
split
seconds
when
--
when
the
door
was
opened
and
closed?
we
think
that
where
an
entry
by
means
of
force,
such
force,
even
the
minimal
force
which
was
used
here,
in
preventing
the
door
from
being
slammed
in
the
face
of
the
officers,
there
must
be
a
notification
of
--
of
identity
and
--
and
purpose.
but
the
law
does
not
require
police
officers
to
--
to
elaborate
on
the
obvious
--
or
--
or
to
--
to
make
speeches
while
--
while
in
the
press
of
circumstances,
such
as
this.
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
--
and
not
require
an
elaborate
statement
of
the
obvious
and
--
and
this
is
what
the
cases
hold.
the
--
the
statute
which
is
involved
here
is
a
--
is
a
fairly
common
statute.
the
states
have
it
and
they
have
said
that
--
that
what
is
necessary
is
--
is
that
they
are
not
required,
the
--
a
statement
of
the
obvious,
an
early
connecticut
case
says
that
it
would
be
a
palpable
perversion
of
the
rule
to
permit
the
benefit
of
it
to
--
to
accrue
to
somebody
who
obviously
knew
of
what
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
one
of
the
considerations
is
that.
and
here
of
course,
we're
dealing
with
narcotics
and
marked
money
and
as
--
as
up
to
the
records
in
other
cases
indicated,
it's
--
it
is
very
frequent
that
when
narcotics
violators
suspected
they're
about
to
be
apprehended,
they
can
quickly
destroy
the
--
the
narcotics
and
that
is
the
case
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
indicates
that
a
frequent
means
is
merely
to
flush
the
narcotics
and
the
money
down
in
the
toilet.
and
of
course
that
could've
--
could've
happened
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
--
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
certainly
not
stated
at
--
at
that
very
moment,
while
the
door
is
being
slammed,
i
think
that
after
they
were
in,
had
there
been
a
--
a
question
as
to
why
the
--
the
petitioner
was
being
held,
then
he
would've
been
entitled
to
know
what
--
what
the
offense
was.
of
course,
what
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
there
was
no
explicit
statement
to
that
effect
prior
to
the
entry.
once
the
entry
was
made,
what
--
what
then
occurred
is
that
immediately,
both
the
petitioner
and
the
codefendant,
byrd,
were
placed
under
arrest.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
no,
there
was
not.
and
--
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
law
should
require
police
officers
who
have
to
ask
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
there
are
decisions
as
to
what
must
be
stated
prior
to
entry
on
the
statutes
of
this
sort
and
some
of
them
are
--
are
cited
at
page
27
of
the
government's
brief.
and
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
one
of
those
cases
which
is
a
decision
by
--
by
judge
rosenberry
in
wisconsin,
the
case
is
hiller
against
state
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
a
state
case,
but
--
but
the
requirement
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
there
was
no
federal
cases
that
--
that
deal
with
facts
of
the
sort
that
we
have
here,
there
is
--
there
is
the
accarino
and
the
gatewood
cases,
but
i
think
there,
there
was
no
probable
cause,
that
there
was
subterfuge.
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
--
is
no,
but
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
and
we're
willing
to
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
and
we're
willing
to
accept
the
--
the
accarino
case,
on
the
facts
of
the
accarino
case,
particularly
the
passage
which
appears
at
--
at
page
26
of
the
government's
brief
to
the
effect
that
before
doors
are
broken,
there
must
be
a
necessity
for
so
doing
and
the
notice
of
the
authority
and
purpose
to
make
the
arrest
must
be
given
and
a
demand
in
the
refusal
--
refusal
of
admission
must
be
made.
unless
this
is
already
understood
or
the
peril
would
be
increased
--
now
obviously,
if
you
look
through
a
screen
door
and
you
see
that
the
--
that
the
man
you
seek
to
arrest
is
standing
there
loading
a
shotgun,
you
--
you
move
quickly.
you
move
quickly
in
--
or
--
or
your
life
is
in
jeopardy.
the
rationale
of
the
rule,
i
think,
is
to
minimize
violence,
to
--
to
inform
the
defendant
whether
he
--
he
has
the
grounds
to
resist
an
unlawful
arrest
and
to
minimize
violence.
and
i
think
that
what
the
agents
did
here
in
preventing
the
door
from
being
slammed
and
in
--
in
gaining
access
the
way
they
did,
was
a
--
a
method
and
a
mode
of
entry
reasonably
calculated
to
--
to
minimize
violence.
i
think
there
has
been
a
--
there
was
here,
a
compliance
with
the
requirement
that
they'd
be
communicated
notice
of
purpose
and
authority.
in
the
hiller
case,
the
--
it
was
liquor
case
that
the
--
a
woman
in
the
house
apparently
saw
the
officers
and
came
and
--
and
put
a
hook
on
the
screen
door
and
proceeded
to
dump
the
--
the
bootleg
--
bootleg
liquor,
and
judge
rosenburg
said
--
judge
rosenberry,
excuse
me,
said,
“the
officers
must
act
on
the
situation
that
appears
to
him
and
when
those
in
possession
of
the
premises
to
be
searched
give
no
opportunity
for
a
formal
statement,
that
there
is
no
ceremony
required.”
and
i
think
that
that
--
that
is
this
case.
immediately,
after
gaining
access
to
the
apartment,
both
the
defendant
and
codefendant
were
--
were
placed
under
arrest
and
mr.
justice
douglas
had
some
question
as
to
the
means
by
which
the
--
the
government
acquired
possession
of
the
$34
which
was
on
the
person
of
the
defendant
and
the
testimony
to
that
effect
appears
at
pages
27
and
28
of
the
record.
they
entered
the
apartment.
they
said,
“bessie,
you
are
under
arrest.”
she
stood
up,
her
pocket
was
bulging.
she
stuffed
her
hand
in
when
she
was
asked
what
the
bulge
was.
she
stuck
her
hand
and
said,
“nothing,
but
money.”
she
stuck
her
hand
in
into
the
pocket
and
took
the
money
out.
and
took
the
money
out,
"yes,
sir."
"what
did
you
do
then?”
"i
took
the
money
from
her
and
handed
it
over
to
agent
wilson.
thereafter,
the
money
is
checked
against
the
list
of
the
--
the
marked
money
and
it
is
found
that
$34
of
that
money
was
the
money
which
was
used
to
purchase
the
narcotics.
i
think
no
one
questions
that
in
making
a
lawful
arrest,
there
is
the
right
to
search
the
person
of
the
defendant.
the
bulge
in
the
pocket
could
just
as
easily
have
been
--
been
a
gun
or
a
knife,
a
weapon
to
protect
themselves.
the
officers
have
to
search
the
person
arrested.
it
is
thereafter,
after
the
arrest
and
after
the
discovery
of
the
$34
on
the
person
who
(inaudible)
that
the
search
is
made,
the
search
which
uncovers
various
evidences
of
--
of
engaging
in
the
narcotics
traffic
in
--
in
that
room
on
which
discloses
the
381
capsules
of
heroin
in
furnace
room
as
to
which
the
counts
were
dismissed.
in
urging
the
search
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
they
were
--
they
were
adjacent
rooms
in
the
--
in
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
there
was
a
door.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
you
had
to
go
from
petitioner's
apartment
to
the
common
hallway
to
the
furnace
room.
in
stating
that
the
search
here,
which
uncovered
the
balance
of
the
$100,
was
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
we
emphasize
the
specificity
of
the
search,
that
this
was
not
a
general
rummaging
for
a
private
paper.
this
was
a
search
designed
to
locate
narcotics
which
the
officers
that
had
reason
to
believe
might
--
might
be
on
the
premises
because
a
sale
of
some
narcotics
had
just
been
made
from
those
premises.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
search
was
--
was
from
the
government's
marked
fund.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
said
it
--
it
was
not
a
general
rummaging
through
--
through
the
personal
effects.
it
was
not
a
fishing
expedition.
the
officers
knew
what
they
were
looking
for.
in
fact,
the
testimony
were
stated
what
they
were
looking
for
and
the
nature
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
question
then
would
be
whether
having
--
having
arrested
the
--
the
person,
having
uncovered
34
of
the
dollars,
knowing
that
the
balance
of
the
money
is
on
the
--
is
on
the
premises
and
the
--
the
money
is
the
government's
marked
funds,
which
the
government
is
seeking
to
recapture.
whether
then
you
would
--
you
would
require
a
cessation
and
the
procurement
of
a
--
of
a
search
warrant.
i
think
--
i
think
no
case
imposes
such
a
restriction
upon
the
government.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
these
people
were
taken
for
all
that
it
appears
i
--
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
suppose
--
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
--
an
officer
could've
been
left
at
the
premises.
they
left
the
premises
from
4
a.m.,
in
the
morning,
until
such
time
as
--
as
the
warrant
could've
been
procured.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
what
--
what've
been
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that
this
is
--
is
not
a
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
this
is
not
a
case
which
bears
that
out,
but
yes
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i'm
--
of
course
it's
just
one
thing
but
i
think
that
the
conduct
of
--
of
the
officers
in
this
case
is
not
susceptible
to
the
--
to
any
inference
that
--
that
the
search
was
a
pretext
or
that
there
was
abuse
of
inference.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
it's
--
it's
the
government's
position
that
--
that
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
this
case
that
the
officers
acted
reasonably
and
in
accordance
with
the
--
the
principles
which
have
been
laid
down.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
it
gets
down
to
that.
more
than
that,
i
think
it
gets
down
to
law
enforcement
officials
enforcing
the
law,
pursuant
to
the
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
it
would
have
been
possible
for
them
to
do
that.
it
would
not
have
been
unreasonable
for
them
to
do
that.
i
think
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
them
to
do
what
that
they
did
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
assume
that's
--
that's
why
we're
--
we're
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but,
as
i
say,
in
view
of
the
--
the
knowledge
that
the
balance
of
the
--
of
the
money
was
on
the
premises,
the
fact
that
what
was
sought
to
the
government's
marked
funds
and
all
the
circumstances
at
this
case,
the
limited
specific
search
which
was
made,
i
think
under
all
of
the
majority
opinions
of
this
court,
would
be
sustained.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
in
--
in
certain
circumstances,
there
would
be
no
embarrassment.
i
think
that
it
would
depend
on
--
on
all
those
circumstances
of
the
case.
i
think
that
when
an
officer
and
on
the
assumption
that
--
that
the
physical
premises
could
remain
intact.
i
think
that
--
that
the
cases
have
--
have
held
that
where
an
arrest
is
made,
there
is
the
authority
to
search
not
--
not
only
the
person
(inaudible)
the
defendant,
but
those
things
which
are
in
his
possession
and
control.
and
this
court
has
--
has
sustained
that
authority
in
--
in
many
cases.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think
there's
no
decision
of
--
of
this
court
which
denies
the
authority
to
make
a
search
of
the
sort
that
was
made
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
certainly
--
certainly,
we
have
been
shown
no
such
authority
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
record
shows
that
there
was
a
search
for
an
hour
and
a
half.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
was
an
extensive
search,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
marked
money,
the
balance
of
which
was
in
fact
on
the
premises,
as
the
agents
knew
it
today,
was
concealed
in
the
bed
sheets.
had
--
if
there
would've
been
a
--
the
search
would
have
lasted
two
minutes,
had
miller
said,
“yes,
it's
there.”
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
it's
a
--
one
gives
credit
to
the
--
to
the
ingenuity
of
narcotics
violators
if
the
criterion
becomes
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
--
to
uncover
what
is
known
to
be
on
the
premises.
you
see,
here
they
know
there's
$100
in
the
premises.
they
go
in
$34.
roughly,
a
third,
this
was
on
the
person
of
--
of
one
of
the
defendants.
they
know
that
the
balance
of
that
money
has
to
be
on
--
on
those
--
on
the
premises.
and
--
and
so,
they
--
they
made
the
search
limited
--
limited
to
--
to
the
uncovery
of
the
fountain
of
money
and
--
and
any
additional
narcotics
and
they
were
found
on
the
premises
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
my
reference
to
the
ingenuity
was
only
in
--
in
the
context
of
how
long
it
took
to
--
to
uncover
the
money.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
case
in
which
--
which
by
hypothesis,
if
we
reach
this
question.
the
officers
are
lawfully
on
the
premises,
have
made
a
lawful
arrest,
have
lawfully
uncovered
one-third
of
the
marked
money
and
know
that
the
balances
on
the
premises
and
--
and
i
think
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
say
that
--
that
such
a
search
should
be
sustained
by
--
by
this
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
if
there
is
a
case
even
under
--
under
the
view
which
--
which
you've
expressed
in
the
dissenting
opinions
in
--
in
harris
and
in
rabinowitz,
if
there
is
a
case
in
which
even
under
--
under
the
view
which
you
have
expressed,
where
a
search
will
be
permitted
beyond
the
--
the
physical
person
of
the
defendant,
this
is
such
a
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
was
a
search
that
was
made
at
the
furnace
room
which
uncovered
considerable
narcotics.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
at
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
judge
youngdahl
dismissed
the
counts
with
--
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
respect
to
the
narcotic
confession.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
so,
that's
--
that's
not
in
the
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
it
might
in
the
given
case.
in
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
in
this
case,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
limited
to
the
$100,
which
was
found
in
the
apartment
and
counsel
for
the
defendant
explicitly
stated
in
an
answer
to
a
question
from
the
court
at
the
motion
to
suppress,
that
he
was
--
his
motion
was
limited
to
the
$100,
found
in
the
apartment
and
that
he
made
no
motion
with
respect
to
the
narcotics
found
in
the
furnace
room.
he
was,
of
course,
disclaiming
any
--
any
ownership
or
interest
in
those
narcotics.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
--
that
the
record
is
--
is
clear,
but
--
but
i
will
assume
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
would
presume
that.
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
even
though
in
fact,
judge
youngdahl
dismissed
the
counts
in
the
furnace
room
and
there's
a
colloquy,
before
he
does
that
which
he
indicates
that
--
that
he
felt
that
it
--
it
complicated
what
was
a
fairly
simple
--
simple
case
as
--
as
he
saw
it
that
the
--
that
the
counts
with
respect
to
the
furnace
room
inject
the
complications
into
the
case
and
--
and
because
there
were
doubts
as
to
possession
and
control
and
--
and
he
--
he
dismissed
those
counts.
but
i
think
that
--
that
in
the
light
of
what
the
narcotic
agents
observed
when
revealing
with
the
question
of
probable
cause
and
not
with
the
question
of
legal
evidence
establishing
truth
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
i
think
there
--
it
would
have
been
reasonable
and
--
and
was
reasonable
for
the
--
for
the
agents
to
search
the
furnace
room
as
well.
this
is
not
--
this
--
these
--
this
is
an
adjacent
area
in
--
in
a
--
in
a
basement
of
a
--
of
a
rather
small
building.
this
is
not
a
--
a
vast
expense
and
this
is
not
a
search
of
--
of
an
entire
building.
this
is
a
search
of
--
of
the
--
what
is
an
essence,
a
one-room
apartment
and
the
adjacent
furnace
area.
as
to
both
areas,
the
officers
having
reason
to
believe
that
--
that
either
narcotics
or
marked
money
are
--
are
on
the
premises.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think,
i
can
best
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
--
by
again
stating
the
facts,
the
--
the
physical
layout
here.
when
you
go
through
the
--
the
outside
entrance,
there
are
two
doors.
one
of
which
is
to
the
furnace
room
and
the
other
which
is
to
petitioner's
apartment.
there
is
another
means
by
which
you
can
gain
access
to
the
basement
and
that
is
by
going
through
an
upper
level
which
officer
wurms
did
using
the
skeleton
key
to
open
the
door
which
lead
only
to
a
staircase,
down
to
the
furnace
room.
that's
--
the
--
the
skeleton
key
is
used
on
the
--
on
this
upper
level,
then
going
through
the
furnace
room
and
--
and
coming
out
into
the
hallway.
now,
what
agent
wilson
observed
is
shepherd
going
down
the
stairs
into
the
basement
area
and
then
nobody
in
the
hallway.
he
crossed
the
street.
he
looked
across
the
street
and
then
saw
a
light
go
on
in
the
furnace
room,
which
up
to
that
point,
had
been
darkened
which
i
think
supports
the
inference
that
up
until
that
point,
there
was
nobody
in
the
furnace
room.
thereafter,
shepherd
comes
out.
i
think
that
those
facts
certainly
supply
probable
cause
for
the
agents
to
believe
that
what
had
occurred
is
that
shepherd
went
into
petitioner's
apartment
that
thereafter,
somebody
went
from
petitioner's
apartment
into
the
furnace
room
and
thereafter,
shepherd
--
shepherd
emerged.
i
think
it
is
not
necessarily
inconsistent
to
say
that
it
was
not
--
that
the
--
as
--
as
judge
youngdahl
did
say
that
there
was
not
sufficient
legal
competent
evidence
to
establish
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
petitioner
had
possession
of
the
furnace
room,
not
in
--
necessarily
inconsistent
to
say
that
and
to
say
at
the
same
time
that
there
was,
on
the
basis
of
this
--
these
facts
observed
by
the
agents,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
in
the
furnace
room
as
well
in
petitioner's
apartment,
there
might
be
the
marked
money
or
the
narcotics.
i
--
i
would
like
to
make
reference
to
--
to
two
other
matters.
one
is
although
not
raised
by
petitioner
in
this
case,
there
is
a
question
as
to
sentence.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
as
to
sentence.
there
were
consecutive
sentences
given
here
with
respect
to
the
same
narcotics
transaction,
which
raises
problems
which
this
court
will
--
will
consider
in
the
grower
case,
in
which
certiorari
has
been
granted.
there
is
no
need
however,
to
withhold
disposition
of
this
case.
the
government
respectfully
submits
pending
the
outcome
in
grower
because
in
--
in
any
event,
petitioner
would
be
serving
a
--
a
legal
sentence.
consecutive
sentences
were
imposed
on
counts
two
and
three
with
respect
to
the
same
narcotics
and
in
the
grower
case,
the
question
is
whether
such
consecutive
sentences
can
be
given.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
although
not
raised
here,
the
record
indicates
that
that
problem
is
here,
but
that
should
--
if
this
court
should
decide
that
those
sentences
are
--
cannot
be
imposed
by
collateral
means,
the
--
the
sentences
can
be
corrected,
so
there
is
no
need
to
--
to
withhold
this
decision.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
period
was
from
one
to
four
years
on
the
--
in
the
first
count
which
was
the
conspiracy
and
one
to
four
years
in
count
one
and
30-month
state
years
on
each
of
counts
two
and
three.

the
difficulty
between

to
anticipate
the
basis
on

this
is
the
same
sort
of
problem
as
the
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard

sand
the
unit
of
crime
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
if
it
raises
double
jeopardy
problems
and
it
is
such
a
problem.
in
other
words,
i

i
think
that

mr.
leonard

mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
it
will
show
the
narcotics

will
show
the

of
the

it
will
show
that
--
that
one
count
which
is
for
the

the
other
count
which
is
for

i
think
whether

mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
it
is
doing
that,
is
the
problem.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
apparently.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
would
like
all
to
just
--
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
one
case
which
unfortunately
is
not
--
not
cited
in
the
government's
brief
which
raises
a
question
that
i
have
not

have
not
been
totally
covered
in
oral
argument

that
is
barientes

whether
the

will
be
invoked,
where
the
question
