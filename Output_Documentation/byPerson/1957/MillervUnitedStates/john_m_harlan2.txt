they
searched
on
the
same
room
where
the
rest
remained?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
do
you
concede
see
that
at
this
time
under
district
of
columbia
law,
there
was
a
right
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
for
a
crime
not
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
officers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i'm
puzzled
by
--
this
is
on
--
it
maybe
--
should
ask
the
district
attorney
or
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i'm
raising
the
question
is
that
the
district
of
columbia
code,
as
i
read
it,
"provides
that
ordinary
police
officers
can
only
arrest
without
a
warrant
for
crimes
committed
in
their
presence
and
that
only
the
major
and
the
superintendent
of
police
are
authorized
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
for
a
crime
not
committed
in
their
presence."
i'm
puzzled
by
it,
because
the
case,
it
seemed
to
be
on
the
other
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
maybe
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
united
states
attorney
can
clear
up
my
property.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
adaptation
says,
for
a
probable
inclusion
of
(inaudible)
and
other
offenses,
see
sections
406,
and
you
turn
to
those
and
i
don't
get
any
answer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
happened
to
mrs.
byrd,
she
cried?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
she's
not
up
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
says
they
can't
make
out
in
the
record
just
what
did
happen.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
straighten
me
out
on
this
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
code?
you
smiled,
so
that
will
be
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
answer
to
it,
but
i
don't
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
why
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
don't
refer
to
it
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
ignore
the
code
then.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
much
did
she
get
in
total
or
he
gets?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
--
supposing
the
chain
hadn't
been
broken
and
the
door
was
opened
and
the
police
officers
put
there
--
put
in,
pushed
their
way
in,
could
that
have
been
bad?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
probable
cause,
et
cetera.
justice
john
m.
harlan
depends
on
how
heavy
you
are.
