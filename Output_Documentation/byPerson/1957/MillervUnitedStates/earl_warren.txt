william
miller,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
harris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
rule
out
the
reasonableness
of
the
authority
to
conclude
that
if
they
waited
for
the
second
--
for
the
other
things
that
you
speak
off,
that
the
defendant
took
the
prospective
or
the
--
the
suspected
people
might
elude
the
law.
will
you
rule
out
that
that's
a
reasonable
conduct
on
their
part,
not
to
wait
for
better,
later
opportunities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
the
--
i
haven't
read
the
accarino
case,
except
the
quotation
from
it
in
chief
justice's
dissent,
but
there's
an
--
there's
an
opening,
qualifying
phrase,
“unless
the
necessities
of
the
moment
required
that
the
officer
breakdown
the
door.”
what
do
you
think
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
understand
the
difference
between
the
--
a
warrant,
the
function
of
which
had
become
exhausted
by
prior
use
and
having
no
warrant
at
all.
why
should
there
be
a
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
mean,
what's
the
deception
if
you
got
a
warrant,
there
isn't
any
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
any
worse
than
having
no
warrant
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
include
--
does
that
include
the
right
to
break
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
99?
that's
just
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
--
would
you
discussing
for
a
moment
that
portion
of
the
--
of
the
action
of
the
police
where
they
went
into
a
portion
of
this
building
with
a
--
with
a
passkey?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
might
have
some
bearing
to
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
concern
that
a
breaking
in,
when
he
used
that
--
that
skeleton
key
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
search
that
place
or
to
do
whatever
he
is
going
to
do
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
i
understand
from
mr.
harris
that
--
that
there
had
been
a
light
down
there
in
the
furnace
room
and
that
was
the
reason
perhaps
that
they
used
the
skeleton
key
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
investigate
the
activities
down
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
were
searching
the
place
right
then,
weren't
they,
when
he
went
--
when
he
went
in
with
that
passkey
into
that
room
that
had
--
had
been
occupied
just
a
few
moments
before
by
--
by
one
of
the
participants
in
this
crime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
go
there
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
support
what
inference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
this
--
where
does
this
appear
in
the
record?
what
opportunity
miller
had
to
know
that
these
men
were
police
officers
through
activities
that
he
had
--
or
transactions
he
had
with
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i
--
i
thought
at
one
place
here,
that
you
pointed
out
to
us
on
page
31,
where
counsel
for
petitioner
said
to
one
of
the
officers,
“now,
up
--
up
until
that
time
officer,
did
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
defendant,
miller,
had
done
anything
upon
which
you
could
justify
and
secure
warrant
for
his
arrest?”
and
the
court
said,
“i'm
going
to
exclude
that.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
was
--
that
was
the
court's
conclusion,
but
if
--
if
you're
going
to
rely
upon
the
fact
that
miller
had
contact
with
these
officers
to
a
point
that
he
knew
who
they
were
and
that
they
were
after
him
for
all
violations
in
connection
with
narcotics,
why
shouldn't
he
have
been
enable
to
--
to
ask
that
question
of
the
officer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
they
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
defendant
miller
had
done
anything
up
to
this
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
said
it
was
police,
didn't
he?
that's
the
reason
he
slammed
the
door,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
pointed
out
--
you
pointed
out
to
us,
two
instance
in
the
--
instances
here
where
all
was
said
was
--
as
it
appears
on
page
16.
"will
you
tell
us
what
happened
when
you
went
down
into
the
premise
--
premises
there?"
answer,
“officer
williams
knocked
on
the
door
and
a
voice
from
inside
said,
who
is
there?"
officer
wurms
repeated
the
name,
"blue",
called
"blue."
then
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
“police.”
now,
another
phrase
you
pointed
out
to
us,
one
of
the
officers
testified
to
exactly
the
--
the
same
thing.
i
forgotten
what
page
it
was,
27,
28
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
now,
the
--
the
officer
testified.
“at
that
time,
i
knocked
on
the
door
and
a
--
and
a
voice
inside
asked,
"who
was
there?”
and
i
said
“blue,
police!”
and
he
said,
“who?”
i
said
“blue,
police.”
he
opened
the
door
slightly.
it
was
on
a
chain.
he
took
one
look
at
me
and
tried
to
slam
the
door
at
which
time
i
grabbed
the
door
and
opened
it.”
now,
he
didn't
say
anything
in
either
of
those
places
about
--
about
saying,
“you're
under
arrest.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
that's
when
they
direct
examination,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
responsibility
on
the
police
in
such
circumstances
to
state
what
the
arrest
is
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
they
inform
him
at
all?
did
they
inform
him
at
all
here
that
they
intended
to
arrest
him
for
narcotics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
mean,
before
they
broke
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
no
decisions
on
that
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
a
--
a
state
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
no
--
are
there
no
federal
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
shows
that
--
that
they
searched
for
an
hour
and
a
half?
chief
justice
earl
warren
quite
extensive
search
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
during
this
hour
and
a
half,
did
they
search
the
furnace
room?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
was
that
in
the
possession
or
the
immediate
possession
of
the
--
of
the
defendants?
i
thought
you
said
that
you
had
to
go
out
of
his
apartment,
go
across
the
common
hall,
then
go
down
through
a
passkey
and
to
another
--
into
another
room
in
order
to
get
to
the
furnace
room.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
you
think
it's
into
the
--
if
we're
going
to
determine
whether
the
search
was
reasonable
or
not.
suppose
they
went
through
the
whole
--
whole
building,
through
every
apartment
in
the
building
and
searching
for
something
in
connection
with
this
and
the
judge
said,
“well,
we'll
throw
out
the
--
we'll
throw
out
the
counts
that
--
that
have
to
do
with
the
rest
of
the
building.”
still,
wouldn't
that
bear
upon
the
reasonableness
of
this
particular
search?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose,
they
were
searching
in
the
furnace
room
for
the
$100
just
as
much
as
they
were
narcotics,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
probably
you're
presuming
so
many
things
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
understood
you
--
you
pointed
out
that
this
was
so
detached.
the
furnace
room
was
so
detached
from
the
quarters
of
the
defendant,
that
you
--
you
couldn't
say
that
when
he
used
his
passkey
on
the
furnace
room,
he
was
making
an
illegal
search
on
the
--
on
the
defendant's
premises.
but
now,
you
--
you
take
the
other
view
of
it
and
you
say
that
they
are
so
closely
connected
between
the
two.
that
is
perfectly
reasonable
for
them
to
--
to
search
the
furnace
room
because
they
were
also
searching
his
apartment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren

harris.
