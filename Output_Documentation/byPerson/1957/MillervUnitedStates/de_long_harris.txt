mr.
de
long
harris
thank
you,
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
an
issue
involving
the
breaking
of
a
citizen's
door,
the
nighttime
hours
without
a
warrant
and
without
notification
of
the
purpose
of
seeking
entry.
the
fact
behind
that
question
as
they
arose
in
this
case,
briefly
are
as
follows.
back
in
march
of
1955,
about
1:35
in
the
morning,
federal
bureau
of
narcotics,
agent
wilson
arrested
a
known
narcotic
addict
who
had
given
him
some
information
of
the
payoffs
named
reed.
reed
was
arrested
on
a
warrant
and
charged
a
violation
of
the
narcotic
laws
on
january
20th,
1955.
reed
told
mr.
wilson
that
he
got
his
narcotics
from
the
petitioner
and
from
bessie
byrd
and
he
went
into
a
little
detail.
he
said
that
he
usually
met
a
man
named
shepherd,
about
3
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
that
he
purchased
100-capsule
lots
of
narcotics
from
shepherd,
paying
therefore,
$100.
and
that
usually,
he
would
wait
for
shepherd
to
return
with
the
narcotics,
but
on
other
occasions,
he
had
accompanied
shepherd
in
a
taxicab
up
to
the
1300
block
of
columbia
road,
where
shepherd
would
get
out
of
the
cab
and
go
into
1337
columbia
road,
at
a
place
where
an
apartment
was
occupied
by
the
petitioner,
miller,
and
by
a
codefendant
in
the
case
below,
bessie
byrd.
mr.
wilson
took
reed
down
to
police
headquarters,
but
he
didn't
book
him.
he
didn't
charge
him.
he
didn't
incarcerate
him,
but
rather
took
him
to
a
street
corner
in
the
district
of
columbia
whereby,
a
prearrangement
--
they
met
with
several
district
of
columbia
police
officers,
two
virginia
state
police
officers
and
a
number
of
federal
bureau
of
narcotics
agents.
it
was
planned
and
agreed
as
between
the
group
that
this
man,
reed,
would
cooperate
with
agent
lewis
in
obtaining
a
purchase
of
drugs
from
the
brought
shepherd.
and
in
connection
with
that
plan,
lewis
was
given
$100
in
marked
money
and
it
was
also
understood
that
reed
would
go
along
with
lewis
and
that
there
would
come
a
time
when
he
would
give
reed
some
of
the
money
to
show
shepherd
and
to
tell
him
that
his
partner
would
supply
additional
funds.
now,
the
police
officers
and
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics
agents
occupied
two
cars
and
these
cars
were
equipped
with
radio
so
that
they
could
commincate
as
between
the
two
cars.
so
reed
and
lewis,
the
training
agent
lewis
left
in
a
taxicab
and
proceeded
to
the
home
of
shepherd.
shepherd
got
out
of
the
cab
--
reed
got
out
of
the
cab,
went
into
the
house,
came
back
with
shepherd.
and
it
was
later
said
that
in
the
meanwhile,
reed
had
shown
shepherd
$50
of
the
marked
money
as
a
sort
of
a
bait
or
to
show
him
that
there
was
available
cash.
then
reed,
shepherd
got
back
in
the
cab
with
lewis
and
they
proceeded
to
the
home
of
reed
and
it
had
also
been
agreed
that
lewis
was
to
make
an
attempt
to
put
the
money
on
the
proposed
defendant,
shepherd.
and
that
if
he
did
that
as
a
signal,
lewis
and
reed
was
to
enter
the
vermont
avenue
house,
formerly
the
dwelling
of
reed.
so,
that
happened.
shepherd
remained
in
the
taxicab
and
of
course
he
was
followed
by
the
two
--
followed
the
police
officers
and
agents.
and
the
taxicab
went
in
a
great
circle
of
route,
on
route
picking
up
a
soldier
and
two
other
passengers
and
taking
them
to
their
destination
and
ultimately
coming
to
the
1300
block
of
columbia
road,
nw.
the
cab
double
parked
and
shepherd
got
out
of
the
cab
and
went
into
the
basement
of
1337
which
is
an
apartment
dwelling.
mr.
wilson,
the
narcotic
agent,
followed
him
to
the
door,
looked
into
the
hallway
and
saw
that
shepherd
has
disappeared.
agent
wilson
then
went
across
the
street
where
he
observed
the
light
go
on,
not
in
the
apartment,
but
in
a
furnace
room
that
was
also
in
the
basement.
and
incidentally,
in
this
basement,
there
were
three
entrances,
one
leading
to
the
street,
one
leading
to
the
furnace
room
and
one
leading
to
apartment
no.
1,
which
was
occupied
by
the
petitioner
and
by
bessie
byrd.
now,
wilson
then
got
back
into
his
car,
and
the
two
followed
--
the
officers
followed
the
taxicab
now
occupied
by
shepherd
for
about
three
or
four
blocks
and
then
in
a
rather
dramatic
passion,
they
forced
the
taxicab
over,
stopped
it
and
the
cab
driver
got
out.
the
dome
light
flashed
on
and
shepherd
was
observed
to
put
a
package
under
the
front
seat.
shepherd
was
immediately
arrested
and
he
was
then
searched.
he
was
found
not
to
have
the
marked
money.
and
then,
the
cab
was
searched
and
the
package
was
found
under
the
front
seat
containing
100
capsules
of
a
suspected
opium
derivative
and
i
believe
they
performed
an
immediate
field
test
confirming
that.
shepherd
was
questioned
about
the
package
and
he
first
denied
any
knowledge
of
it.
then
later,
he
said
that
he
has
been
up
to
columbia
road,
but
that
he
had
done
that
at
the
behest
of
reed
and
lewis
and
that
he
had
been
told
that
if
he
looked
behind
the
fire
extinguisher
in
the
hallway,
he
would
find
the
narcotics.
the
agents
and
officers
then
immediately
proceeded
to
1337
columbia
road
where
police
officer
wurms
went
upstairs
to
the
first
floor
entrance
and
he
proceeded
down
the
hall
to
a
doorway
and
down
from
stairs.
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
there
was
a
door
leading
to
the
furnace
room
and
to
the
basement
hallway
and
this
door
was
locked.
also,
wurms
used
the
skeleton
key
and
affected
an
entry
into
the
--
the
basement
hallway.
in
the
meanwhile,
mr.
wilson
had
gone
through
the
basement
door,
put
it
there
to
the
door
of
apartment
no.
1
and
in
effort
to
ascertain
if
he
could
hear
any
movements
or
signs
of
life
inside,
and
he
heard
no
such
sound.
wurms
then
joined
wilson
at
the
door.
mr.
de
long
harris
he
heard
no
signs
of
life
inside
the
apartment.
now,
when
wurms
joined
wilson
at
the
door,
one
or
both
of
them
knocked
and
they
said
they
knocked
very
softly
and
in
a
very
low
voice
said,
“police
--
blue.
police
open
up!"
and
that
was
repeated
twice.
a
voice
from
the
inside
said,
“who's
there?”
and
then,
the
door
was
partially
opened
and
it
was
secured
by
an
ordinary
chain
lock
or
chain
latch.
officer
wurms
testified
that
--
know
if
--
wanted
to
know
what
they
were
doing
there
and
to
quote
what
was
said
by
miller
as
testified
to
by
wurms.
he
said,
“what
do
you
all
want?”
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
question
was
ever
answered.
and
then
mr.
wurms
put
his
hand
inside
the
door,
caught
a
hold
of
the
chain
and
the
door
and
forced
the
door
open
and
in
the
process,
broke
off
the
chain
from
the
door.
when
they
went
inside,
they
said
to
miller,
“sit
down,
you're
under
arrest.”
and
likewise
told
bessie
byrd
the
same
thing
and
said,
“we
are
looking
for
our
marked
money.”
bessie
byrd
handed
on
a
housecoat,
“we
are
looking
for
our
marked
money.”
now,
bessie
byrd
handed
on
a
housecoat
and
the
pocket
of
that
housecoat
contains
the
money
and
it
proves
to
contain
$34
of
the
marked
currency.
then,
a
search
ensued
and
at
the
end
of
about
an
hour
and
a
half,
the
remaining
$66
--
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
i
say
it
was
not
done
voluntarily.
she
had
her
hand
in
her
coat
pocket.
officer
wurms
asked
her,
“what
do
you
have
here?”
she
said,
“it's
only
money.”
and
according
to
the
testimony
as
i
recall,
he
said,
“the
money
was
then
taken
from
her.”
mr.
de
long
harris
officer
wurms.
now
--
mr.
de
long
harris
there
is
no
conflict.
there's
no
contention
that
this
money
was
given
voluntarily
by
bessie
byrd.
at
the
end
of
this
hour
and
a
half
long
search,
some
of
the
money
was
found
between
sheets
on
the
bed
and
the
rest
of
it
in
the
hat
box,
so
that
the
whole
$100
of
marked
money
was
recovered.
mr.
de
long
harris
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
it
appeared
that
this
was
an
apartment
consisting
of
a
sort
of
hallway
and
a
bedroom.
now,
when
the
door
to
apartment
1
opens
up,
you
are
in
the
bedroom,
as
i
understand
the
record.
mr.
de
long
harris
the
search
went
on
for
one
hour
and
a
half.
now,
in
our
question
--
mr.
de
long
harris
the
$66,
part
was
found
in
a
hatbox
in
the
apartment
and
the
rest
was
found
in
the
bed
between
the
sheets.
mr.
de
long
harris
the
record
does
not
say
it.
now,
it
is
this
petitioner's
position
that
the
rationale
of
title
18,
section
3109
which
incidentally
only
provides
for
search
warrants,
but
says
this,
“the
officer
may
break
open
any
(inaudible)
or
any
door
or
window
of
the
house,
or
any
part
of
the
house
or
anything
there
is
to
execute
a
search
warrant,
if
after
notice
of
his
authority
and
purpose,
he
had
has
refused
admittance
or
when
necessary
to
liberate
himself
or
first
in
aiding
him
in
the
execution
of
the
warrant.”
that,
of
course,
pertains
to
search
warrants.
the
government
however
on
pages
10
and
page
23
of
its
brief,
concedes
that
the
entry
here
must
be
tested
under
the
standard
as
enunciated
in
section
3109.
so,
i
will
not
concern
myself
later
to
that
particular
point.
however,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
original
3109
which
was
called
section
619
of
title
11
of
the
espionage
act,
was
enacted
at
a
time
when
congress
gave
to
the
federal
agents
and
to
the
federal
government
for
the
first
time,
a
general
power
of
search.
and
incidentally,
3109
was
taken
almost
verbatim
from
the
new
york
law
on
this
subject,
but
of
course,
since
it
only
pertained
to
search
warrants,
it
had
nothing
to
do,
of
course,
with
arrest
without
a
warrant.
mr.
de
long
harris
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
de
long
harris
the
government
says
that
they
agreed
that
the
validity
of
the
entry
herein
question,
must
be
tested
under
the
standard
of
3109.
mr.
de
long
harris
no,
i
--
i
don't
believe
that's
the
question
that
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
de
long
harris
i'm
not
contesting
that
--
mr.
de
long
harris
i
am
not.
i
am
agreeing
with
them.
i'm
saying
that
as
a
result
of
that
concession,
i
don't
--
my
burden
is
made
lighter.
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
particular
point.
i'm
saying
that
the
--
mr.
de
long
harris
even
with
a
search
warrant,
this
entry
would
not
be
valid.
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
we're
saying
not
that
the
--
the
law
applies,
but
the
rationale
behind
the
particular
statute
and
i'm
about
to
come
to
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
it
applies
in
the
district,
pertaining
directly
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
in
a
home.
mr.
de
long
harris
no.
that
is
not
my
main
theory.
justice
frankfurter,
we
are
saying
that
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
says
that
before
you
can
arrest
a
citizen
in
his
home,
you
must
not
and
you
must
do
two
things.
you
must
notify
him
of
the
authority
and
notify
him
of
your
purpose.
mr.
de
long
harris
the
arrest
and
the
entry.
yes.
mr.
de
long
harris
that
is
correct.
mr.
de
long
harris
and
we
say
that
the
arrest
was
illegal
because
the
entry
was
illegal
under
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia.
incidentally
--
mr.
de
long
harris
there
was
no
warrant.
no
effort
to
make
--
to
obtain
a
warrant
and
the
government
argues
that
here
was
a
situation
where
they
had
to
act
in
a
hurry,
but
of
course,
we
disagree
with
that
contention.
mr.
de
long
harris
at
1:35
in
the
morning,
that
same
morning,
the
narcotic
addict,
reed,
told
wilson
that
he
had
bought
his
narcotics
from
shepherd
and
that
shepherd,
in
turn,
got
the
narcotics
from
william
miller.
mr.
de
long
harris
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned.
mr.
de
long
harris
1:35
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
de
long
harris
4
--
4
a.m.
mr.
de
long
harris
i
do
not
concede
that,
because
according
--
mr.
de
long
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
de
long
harris
however,
the
authorities
could
have
done
this.
shepherd,
according
to
their
plan,
was
about
to
bring
some
narcotics
back
to
--
the
agent
lewis.
and
there
was
no
occasion
really
for
immediately
arresting
shepherd
in
this
dramatic
street
arrest
when
they
could've
gotten
a
perfect
case
on
him
by
allowing
him
to
deliver
the
narcotics
to
lewis.
and
of
course,
the
warrant
could
have
been
gotten
until
the
next
morning,
that
morning
or
so
or
weeks,
thereafter.
mr.
de
long
harris
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
i
would
rule
it
out
and
i
would
say
that
it
would've
been
a
wide
one.
certainly,
a
more
judicial
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
officers
to
let
there
be
some
judicial
magistrate
or
some
intervening
authority
to
be
determined
--
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
all
that
happened,
as
they
arrested
shepherd
on
the
street.
they
say
that
shepherd's
arrest
would
--
might
have
tipped
off
miller.
the
way
they
did
it,
that
might
have
happened,
but
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
--
that
need
not
have
been.
they
didn't
need
to
immediately
arrest
shepherd.
shepherd
was
going
to
bring
the
narcotics
back
to
lewis,
back
on
vermont
avenue,
where
lewis
was
supposed
to
be
at
least
waiting
for
him.
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
let
me
say,
justice
frankfurter,
that
that
is
not
the
burden
of
my
argument
here.
we
are
saying
that
we
don't
say
that
they
had
probable
cause.
we
say
they
did
not
have
probable
cause,
but
that
is
not
the
principal
portion
of
our
argument.
we
are
saying
not
only
if
they
had
probable
cause,
but
if
this
apartment
had
a
plate
glass
window
and
they
had
klieg
lights
and
could've
seen
the
transaction,
they
still
have
to
knock
on
the
door
and
let
no
one
know
who
they
were
and
why
they
were
seeking
entry
to
his
house.
that
is
our
argument
and
the
--
of
course,
the
question
of
probable
cause
has
been
argued
by
the
government
in
point
1
of
their
brief.
they
say
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause.
and
therefore,
they
had
a
right
to
arrest
miller
in
his
apartment.
without
conceding
the
point,
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
let
us
suppose
that
they
did
have
probable
cause,
and
that
not
only
has
probable
cause,
but
they
had
knowledge.
we
are
saying
that
in
the
law,
in
the
district
of
columbia
required
the
officers
to
give
notice
of
their
purpose
to
let
him
know
the
cause
of
their
demands
for
entering.
now,
of
course,
there
is
no
federal
law
treating
of
arrest
without
a
warrant
and
searches
of
this
particular
sort.
so
according
to
the
--
the
di
re
decision
of
this
court,
the
local
state
law
would
apply.
now,
unfortunately
for
the
petitioner,
we
have
some
very
good
and
very
clear
law
on
this
subject,
the
accarino
case
in
which
there's
a
very
long
and
very
scholarly
discussion
by
judge
prettyman,
discusses
all
of
the
pertinent
american
authorities,
all
of
the
historical
background,
hale,
byrnes,
blackstone
and
as
far
back
as
some
of
these
cases.
and
insofar
as
the
district
of
columbia
is
concerned,
they
say
or
judge
prettyman
said
in
the
accarino
decision
that
“you
cannot
enter
the
citizen's
home
without
a
warrant
to
arrest
him,
without
first
giving
a
cause
of
your
demand
for
entry.”
mr.
de
long
harris
well
--
merely,
the
--
the
thing
from
accarino,
the
whole
quotation,
because
as
i
understand
accarino,
it's
a
twofold
holding.
accarino
said
that
the
arrest
in
accarino
was
illegal
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
unless
the
necessities
of
the
moment
demand
and
in
reasonable
contemplation,
the
officers
could
not
have
secured
a
warrant,
then
the
officer
may
not
breakdown
the
citizen's
door
to
arrest
him.
the
second
aspect
of
accarino
and
this
is
the
aspect
that
i
am
arguing
here
primarily,
says
that,
“given
probable
cause
--
in
so
many
words,
judge
prettyman
said
that,
“given
probable
cause,
you
must
first
make
known
the
cause
of
your
demand
for
entry.”
and
judge
prettyman
says
that
all
of
the
authorities
are
in
agreement
in
that
particular
respect.
let
me
read
from
it.
upon
one
topic,
there
appears
to
be
no
dispute
in
authorities.
before
an
officer
can
break
open
a
door
to
a
home,
he
must
make
known
the
cause
of
his
demands
for
entry.
there
is
no
claim
in
the
case
at
bar
that
the
officers
advised
the
suspect
to
the
cause
of
their
demand,
before
they
broke
down
the
door.
upon
that
clear
ground
alone,
the
breaking
of
the
door
was
unlawful.
the
presence
of
the
officers
in
the
apartment
was
unlawful
and
so,
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
now,
that
is
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
accarino,
is
not
an
isolated
decision,
accarino
was
again
reiterated
and
reaffirmed
in
a
case
called
gatewood
against
united
sates,
the
citation
for
which
is
in
my
brief
wherein
the
government
tries
to
distinguish
gatewood
saying
there
was
also
a
subterfuge
view.
in
the
gatewood
case,
the
officers
had
a
warrant,
but
as
it
turned
out,
it
was
a
bench
warrant
that
had
already
been
executed.
so,
the
warrant
was
in
fact,
invalid.
nevertheless,
in
that
decision,
they
say
that
the
principle
of
accarino
must
apply
and
that
because
in
that
particular
case
without
giving
notice
of
their
true
purpose,
they
forced
their
way
into
the
apartment
of
gatewood,
and
therefore
their
entry
was
illegal
and
the
arrest
was
illegal
in
the
same
fashion
as
--
was
to
in
accarino.
now
--
mr.
de
long
harris
there
is
no
difference.
gatewood
--
the
holding
in
gatewood
was
these
officers
were
in
fact
entering
without
a
warrant.
mr.
de
long
harris
oh,
the
deception?
mr.
de
long
harris
no,
the
deception
was
they
cried
out,
instead
of
saying,
"police!"
they
said,
“western
union.”
and
the
man,
gatewood,
partially
opened
his
door
in
response
to
the
cry
of
western
union,
so
that
would
be
subtefuge
in
the
gatewood
case,
and
i
really
don't
think
that
is
important
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
it
matters
to
our
purpose
in
here
now.
in
another
case
--
mr.
de
long
harris
that
is
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
i'm
saying
here
--
mr.
de
long
harris
you
may
arrest
in
the
district
of
columbia
upon
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
we
don't
concede
the
probable
cause.
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
that's
entitled
for,
i
believe
that
your
honor
--
mr.
de
long
harris
--
maybe
informed
and
i
have
read
that
--
mr.
de
long
harris
i
have
read
that
section
and
i
read
the
adaptation
in
the
--
adaptations
of
the
code,
but
they
say
by
inference
that
the
major
and
superintendent
might
delegate
his
authority.
it's
somewhere
on
the
adaptation,
but
--
mr.
de
long
harris
406
does
not
answer
the
problem.
mr.
de
long
harris
but
i
can
confess,
insofar
as
the
printed
law
is
concerned,
there
is
nothing
clear
on
it,
but
we
have
operated
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
--
all
through
the
years
on
the
assumption
that
an
officer
can
make
an
arrest
for
that
one.
mr.
de
long
harris
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
de
long
harris
no,
but
--
mr.
de
long
harris
no
question
about
that
whatsoever,
nothing
whatsoever.
and
we
are
saying
--
mr.
de
long
harris
of
course
not,
chief
justice.
we
are
--
we
are
saying
that's
our
argument
here.
there
is
no
law
authorizing
anybody
to
break
in
to
a
man's
house
without
giving
notice
of
his
authority
purpose,
no
law
anywhere.
now,
some
other
states,
kentucky,
one,
new
york,
one,
california,
for
another,
have
statutes
pertaining
to
arrest,
but
containing
the
context
similar
to
that
contained
in
3109
requiring
--
giving
the
--
of
notice
of
authority
and
purpose,
but
they
used
curiously
enough
the
word
"explain".
the
officer
shall
not
break
the
door
unless
he
explains
his
purpose.
and
i
think
when
you
come
to
a
man's
door
and
cry
out,
“police!”
you
are
not
explaining
your
purpose.
you
are
not
telling
why
you
are
there.
you
are
not
telling
why
you
are
asking,
entering
into
the
man's
house.
if
these
officers
had
been
in
the
full
red
and
blue
uniform,
miller
could've
opened
his
door
and
he
could've
seen
that
they
were
police,
but
that
didn't
give
them
any
authority
to
break
his
door
down
unless
they
first
told
him
why
they
wanted
to
come
in.
now,
the
government
argues
that
there
was
some
knowledge
on
the
part
of
miller.
it
seemed
as
though
wilson
said
that
he,
on
a
previous
occasion,
a
previous
narcotic
arrest
had
seen
miller.
and
had
some
contact
with
him,
but
they
never
had
any
conversation
and
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
though
wilson
knew
miller,
that
miller
knew
wilson
and
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
impute
knowledge
for
the
suspect
and
as
a
result
of
the
imputation
of
knowledge
to
the
suspect,
his
offense
would
be
primary
and
plain
required
duty
of
the
officer
to
make
such
an
announcement.
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
do
that
and
as
judge
edgerton
says
in
the
dissent
here,
even
assuming
--
even
if
you
assume
that
miller
did
know
wilson,
there
was
no
reason
why
wilson
and
wurms
should
not
answer,
asked
to
them,
why
they
wanted
to
come
into
this
house.
now
--
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
knowledge
as
to
who
wilson
was,
not
knowledge
as
to
his
purpose
in
entering
the
premises,
but
they
say
that
wilson
had
seen,
know
of
before
in
a
previous
narcotic
arrest
and
that
therefore,
miller
knew
wilson.
we
don't
agree
with
that
of
course,
but
we
say
that
even
if
miller
did
know
wilson,
it
wouldn't
make
a
part
to
be
different,
because
you
cannot
dispense
with
the
obligation
of
the
officers
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
enunciated
in
the
accarino
case
or
making
that
announcement.
and
we
say
also
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
it
appeared
that
the
primary
and
almost
sole
purpose
of
the
officers
was
to
recover
the
$100,
in
marked
currency.
and
that
as
the
consequence,
the
arrest
was
merely
a
pretext
for
the
search,
the
officers,
all
through
the
record,
they
say
when
they
first
got
in,
“we
are
looking
for
our
marked
money.”
the
marked
money
was
really
what
they
wanted
and
i
don't
believe
that
they
could've
mean
any
thought
of
the
case
without
the
marked
money
and
therefore,
they
were
intent
upon
obtaining
the
marked
money
and
incidentally,
of
course,
arresting
miller.
mr.
de
long
harris
she
was
crying
and
in
--
at
the
trial,
she,
jointly
with
miller,
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
this
evidence
which
was
heard
and
denied
and
she
also
appealed
to
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
the
district
of
columbia,
but
the
appeal
--
the
result
was
a
split
court,
judge
edgerton
dissenting
in
the
conviction
of
byrd
was
upheld.
mr.
de
long
harris
she
did
not
feel
good.
she
did
not
file
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
de
long
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
de
long
harris
i
don't
know
if
we
can
have
our
case
in
either
two,
but
we're
going
to
take
both
of
those
petitions.
mr.
de
long
harris
as
to
the
contrary,
i
--
mr.
de
long
harris
[laughs]
thank
you.
mr.
de
long
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
the
barientes
case
that
my
friend
just
mentioned
here,
for
the
case
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
was
from
the
fifth
circuit.
there
was
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
which
the
court
used
this
language
in
the
per
curiam
opinion,
while
the
use
of
the
excessive
force
that
is
unnecessary
for
as
in
any
case
be
depreciated,
evidence
obtained
on
a
valid
one
is
not
thereby
made
inadmissible.
so
on
the
first
phase
barientes
which
is
not
the
situation
here,
because
there
was
a
valid
one
and
they
were
of
course
discussing
what
i
first
discussed,
3109.
but
the
curious
thing
about
the
barientes
decision
is
that
judge
reeves
concurred
specially
and
in
the
special
concurring
opinion,
judge
brown
concurred
with
the
special
concurrence
wherein
they
held
that
barientes
really
didn't
have
a
question
of
excessive
force
because
the
record
shows
that
there
was
no
force,
and
the
government
argued
and
in
the
petition
before
this
court,
in
our
position
to
the
petitioner
for
certiorari,
the
government
argued
that
in
barientes,
there
was
cause
used.
and
probably,
it
might
have
been
the
basis
of
the
denial
certiorari
of
the
barientes
case.
so,
barientes
case
certainly
doesn't
apply
here.
i
--
you
have
the
barientes
case.
in
fact,
i
have
a
copies
of
the
petition
and
the
brief,
you
all
know
about
it,
but
the
factual
question
was
not
present
in
that
case.
and
secondly,
it
was
a
case
we
won.
i
would
like
also
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
wilson's
testimony
at
the
trial.
now,
throughout
all
these
proceedings
at
the
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
majority
opinion
said
that
they
could
not
tell
from
the
record
what
actually
happened
outside
the
door
in
a
few
minutes.
but
the
government
had
no
time
to
argue
that
it
was
the
fact
that
anybody
said,
“you
are
under
arrest,”
before
that
door
was
broken.
mr.
sand
also
complains
that
we
didn't
cross-examine
wilson
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
now,
bear
in
mind,
wilson
had
testified
on
the
hearing
on
the
motion.
now,
this
motion
to
suppress
was
filed
within
a
matter
of
days
after
the
arrest
and
filed
to
indictment.
after
the
indictment
and
during
trial
and
before
the
jury
during
the
general
hearing
of
this
case,
it
was
then
that
mr.
wilson
said
that
--
these
words,
“you
are
under
arrest.
we
want
in.”
but
curiously
enough,
wilson
didn't
even
remember
the
chains
being
on
the
door's
(inaudible).
and
to
refresh
his
memory,
the
counsels
for
miller
had
to
produce
the
transcript
on
the
motion
to
read
to
him
his
testimony
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
showing
that
he
had
talked
about
breaking
the
chain.
but
when
he
got
to
the
trial
stage
of
this
proceeding,
he
didn't
remember
anything
at
all
about
the
chain
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
in
the
trial
proceeding,
the
united
states
hasn't
mentioned
so
much
about
this
testimony
of
wilson,
because
wurms
was
the
man.
he
put
his
hand
and
ripped
the
--
the
chain
off.
he
was
the
man
who
broke
the
door
and
at
the
motion,
and
at
trial,
he
testified
that
there
was
nothing
said
about
arrests
prior
to
the
breaking
of
the
chain.
now,
on
page
134
of
the
record
if
the
cross
--
if
the
--
the
cross-examination
of
mr.
wilson,
i
think
it
starts
on
--
at
the
trial,
starts
on
133.
and
on
page
--
page
140
--
134,
wilson,
on
cross-examination,
is
asked
this
question.
and
of
course,
he
has
said
above
in
answer
to
the
question
by
the
court,
the
court
says,
“all
right,
we
want
a
deference,
the
witness.”
also,
wurms
knocked
on
the
door,
he
says,
“blue,
open
the
door.
police!”
there
was
a
voice
inside
that
says;
“who's
there?”
and
wurms
again
knocked
in
the
door
--
on
the
door
and
says,
“blue,
open
the
door.
now,
that
was
a
response
to
an
inquiry
by
judge
youngdahl
at
the
trial.
then,
following
that
inquiry
by
the
court,
he
was
asked
this
question.
“that
was
everything
also
wurms
or
yourself
said?"
answer,
"until
the
door
was
opened
yet.”
"now,
when
you
say,
until
the
door
was
opened,
is
it
a
fact
that
the
door
was
not
opened
except
by
yourself
and
also
wurms?"
"no,
sir,
it
is
not."
question,
“well,
i
think
you
testified
there
was
a
chain
on
the
door
which
was
forced
by
yourself
and
also
wurms.
didn't
you
testify
to
that?”
the
court,
“he
did
so
testify.
i
don't
remember
him
saying
anything
about
the
chain
being
forced.”
question
by
mr.
willams,
“how
was
(inaudible)
to
the
effectiveness
to
the
apartment?"
answer,
“until
now,
i
had
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
at
the
door
and
then
refused
to
let
us
in
the
place,
the
door
was
forced
open
then.”
question,
“was
there
a
chain
on
the
door?”
answer,
“not
to
my
recollection.”
now,
that
is
the
same
wilson
who
also
in
the
other
proceeding,
had
told
and
described
in
perfect
detail
what
had
--
happened
with
respect
to
the
chain.
and
that
in
the
--
the
further
cross-examination
of
mr.
wilson,
when
he
was
confronted
with
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion,
he
then
recall
that
he
had
so
testified
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
and
i
think
this
testimony
concerning
the
word,
“arrest”
prior
to
the
answer
to
the
door,
comes
within
the
same
category.
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
if
all
that
--
mr.
de
long
harris
well,
in
the
gatewood
case,
there
was
no
act
of
breaking
on
the
door.
it
was
just
according
to
the
record.
in
that
case,
they
forced
open
the
door.
now,
in
the
district
of
columbia,
we
have
the
(inaudible)
decision
which
is
in
the
(inaudible)
and
i
believe
quoted
in
our
brief
wherein
they've
called
back
again
to
the
common
law,
where
they
said,
“you
find
a
--
a
door
slightly
ajar.
you
may
push
it,
but
if
any
force
is
required
to
open
that
door,
it
constitutes
a
breaking
and
you
can't
do
that."
so,
i
think,
if
you've
got
to
use
a
force
by
pushing
with
a
foot,
i
think
that
constitutes
a
breaking.
mr.
de
long
harris
that
depends,
your
honor.
i'm
naturally
150
pounds
[laughs].
thank
you,
your
honor.
