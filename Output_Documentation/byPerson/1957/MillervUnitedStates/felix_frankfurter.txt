justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
--
do
you
say
the
government
--
there
was
no
search
warrant
and
that's
the
reason?
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet,
you
say
the
government
rests
on
defenses
on
3109,
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
when
you
got
a
search
warrant
or
not,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
what
it
means
to
say
that
you
have
a
provision
of
--
that
congress
provided,
the
power
of
search
warrant
maybe
executed.
and
yet,
you
indicate
that
you're
contesting
the
government's
position
that
the
standard
of
determining
how
you
can
search
without
a
warrant
is
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
you're
objecting
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
if
--
even
if
this
was
a
search
warrant,
this
wouldn't
be
valid,
if
you're
saying
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
why
you
argue
that.
why
we
should
say
that
the
provision
specifications
by
congress
and
how
a
search
warrant
maybe
executed
apply
when
you
haven't
got
a
search
warrant?
i
don't
understand
that
kind
of
an
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
go
ahead
and
argue
your
way,
but
i
don't
understand
an
argument
that
takes
to
determine
whether
behavior
without
a
search
warrant
is
legal
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
search
warrant.(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
now
talking
about
the
legality
of
arrest,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
that's
a
different
story
again.
you're
now
considering
whether
this
is
an
allowable
search
on
the
basis
of
a
legal
arrest
and
you're
not
challenging
the
legality
of
the
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
hold
you
up
long
enough
to
ask
(inaudible)
you
probably
stated
and
i
not
heard
it
or
attend
to
it.
does
the
record
show
when
the
authorities
first
had
reasonable
ground
or
some
ground
for
suspecting
the
present
petitioner?
the
record
shed
any
light
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
the
first
knowledge
i
had
about
the
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1:35
a.m.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
was
the
transaction
in
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
4
a.m.
so
that
as
the
matter
of
time,
in
this
case,
it
isn't
like
other
cases
that
come
become
before
this
court
where
the
authorities
had
ample
notice.
you've
got
to
be
able
to
get
a
search
warrant,
is
that
right?
or
don't
you
concede
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
time
is
pretty
short
here,
between
1:35
in
the
morning
and
4
something
in
--
the
same
morning,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
might
have
been
tipped
off.
the
suspects
might
have
been
tipped
off
by
somebody
and
--
and
make
way,
make
a
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
foreclose
the
question
of
search,
certainly
not,
but
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
you
think,
the
court
should
lay
down
such
nice
judgment
or
such
careful
judgments
upon
the
arresting
officers
as
to
lead
us
to
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
didn't
have
to
act
at
once.
they
could've
waited
for
the
net
to
be
strung
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
there's
--
there's
nothing
unique
about
that
is
there
in
the
criminal
procedure
of
the
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
an
officer
can
arrest,
although
the
crime
is
not
committed
in
his
presence
to
be
as
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
the
particular
person
is
the
comitant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
unique
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
your
argument
is
(a)
the
arrest
was
illegal
and
therefore
everything
that
follows
is
illegal,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
the
arrest
was
legal.
do
you
then
agree
or
concede,
what
i
mean
a
confession,
does
it
follow
that
on
this
record,
the
search
was
legal?
in
short,
as
your
whole
case
turn
on
the
illegality
of
the
arrest
which
renders
the
sequence
of
the
illegality
to
which
the
search
also
illegal,
or
may
you
disagree
with
the
--
on
the
legality
of
the
--
the
arrest
and
still
trying
to
search
him
still.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
not,
the
fact
of
an
arrest
is
legal
doesn't
mean
that
the
police
can
do
anything
they
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well
therefore,
someone
who
said,
the
only
way
you
can
have
a
case
is
to
beat
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
what
our
cases
add
up
to
--
up
to
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
very
a
clear
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
--
the
many
language
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
if
it's
before
the
court
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
as
you
just
said.
now,
did
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
necessary
that
it
should
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
the
preliminary
question
of
the
admissibility
is
not
before
the
court
alone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
now,
all
this
and
that
--
if
the
determination
of
that
motion
turned
on
whether
the
arrest
was
legal,
all
that
evidence
must've
been
before
the
trial
judges
bearing
on
the
legality
of
the
arrest,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
testimony
of
the
police,
what
they
said
in
counter
testimony
if
there
were,
there
had
been
counter
testimony,
all
that
is
before
the
trial
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
before
--
before
the
trial
on
the
preliminary
motion
to
suppress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it
is
on
that,
that
the
admissibility
term.
you
can't
make
up
for
it
by
later
testimony
that
came
out
of
the
trial,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
accept
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
statement
to
what
the
colloquy
showed,
but
it
isn't
fresh
in
my
mind,
but
it
occurs
to
the
--
the
basis
of
my
inquiry
is
this,
that
if
a
motion
to
suppress
--
if
the
transaction
out
of
which
the
search
grew
turned
on
the
legality
of
the
arrest,
it
would
be
important
for
me
to
know
what
the
trial
judge's
judgment
was
on
the
adequacy
of
the
basis
for
the
subsequent
search
and
i
should
like
to
note,
is
there
any
light
on
that,
whether
there
was
any
ruling
by
the
trial
judge
on
that
legal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
yes,
but
he
made
no
comment.
as
no
--
we
have
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
would
it
bother
you
--
would
it
bother
you
if
you
first
stated
what
your
legal
propositions
are
with
reference
to
which
one
is
to
judge
the
facts
of
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
bother
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
read
the
--
the
provisions
to
which
justice
harlan
called
my
attention
that
the
limitation
to
--
to
major
or
police
and
the
other
people,
relates
to
felonies
committed
in
a
building.
now,
is
this
--
does
it
appear
from
the
record,
this
is
committed
in
a
building?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
conspiracy
was
committed
in
the
building?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
but
there's
a
count
on
conspiracy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
maybe
one
reason.
and
that
a
straight
provision
like
that,
making
a
difference
between
a
crime
committed
in
a
building
or
on
a
wall,
or
in
a
ship,
but
leave
at
large
a
conspiracy
which
isn't
committed
in
any
of
these
things,
but
in
men's
minds
floating
around.
i
can
see
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there's
no
difficulty
about
judges
from
the
--
having
ruled
the
way
they
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
opposite
is
--
that
the
complementary
importance
is
also
true,
namely,
if
a
code
provision
restricts
the
matter
in
which
you
make
an
arrest
in
a
building
on
a
theory
that
a
building
is
every
man's
castle
et
cetera,
then
you
want
to
be
very
scrupulous
in
enforcing
the
limitations.
so,
it
works
both
ways.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that.
that's
the
third
theory
discussed,
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
because
there
is
a
need
of
constituting
arrest
that
there's
likeness
at
large,
or
--
or
leave
at
large
to
search
everything
in
sight,
because
the
police
can
hold
their
men,
prevent
disposition
of
the
things
to
be
searched
long
enough
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
does
that
--
does
that
prove,
the
fact
that
he
had
known
miller
doesn't
prove
that
miller
knew
him,
but
he
knew
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
about
miller,
doesn't
prove
that
he
--
miller
knew
about
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
well,
go
on,
i
don't
follow.
the
narcotics
people
know
about
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
know
them.
indeed,
i
should
take
a
look,
but
that's
one
of
their
chief
jobs
to
know
about
people
who
don't
know
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
leave
an
important
consideration
is
that
no
needless,
no
superfluous
opportunity
be
left
to
suspects,
to
put
away
with
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
your
implication
is
that
there
is
no
federal
law,
that
there
is
no
national
federal
law
on
what
is
a
valid
arrest
and
that
therefore
if
you
look
to
the
local
law,
to
the
state
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
termination
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
what
was
the
geographic
relation
of
the
furnace
room
to
the
room
in
which
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
open
--
open
connection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
had
to
go
through
the
door
into
the
next
room?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
was
not
--
why
do
you
say
it
was
not
a
private
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
why
did
you
say
it
was
not
in
a
--
what
did
you
about
private
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
makes
it
--
as
to
my
mind,
it
makes
it
easier
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
police
have
power
either
by
explicit
statute
or
by
implication
of
their
authority
to
padlock
the
place?
but
they
--
they
took
these
people
away
right
away,
to
the
police
station?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
padlocked
the
place,
if
they
had
a
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
keen
for
search
warrants.
they're
keen
for
non-search
warrants.
that's
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
about
police
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
says
that
--
it
says
the
--
this
is
the
only
case
i
hold
from
under
my
eyes
since
i've
been
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
made
the
remotest
suggestion.
it
just
doesn't
manifest
disinterested
or
--
or
appropriate
zeal
on
the
part
of
the
law
enforcing
authorities.
my
question
has
behind
it,
some
other
thoughts,
namely,
the
restricted
procedures
under
which
they
should
operate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that,
you
don't
feel
angry
that
they
did
something
awful?
they
really
enforced
the
law
which
has
behind
it
in
an
important
public
interest
and
you
ought
to
be
very
flustered
and
fastidious
about
seeing
how
they
do
it.
that's
what
it
gets
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
it,
but
i'm
suggesting
they
could
very
be
left,
officer-in-charge
without
a
search
warrant,
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
or
8
o'clock
with
your
information
that
you
ever
is
(inaudible)
are
available
and
then
search
the
place
thoroughly
on
the
very
good
cause
they
had
here
for
searching.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends
on
what
this
court
will
decide
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you
in
connection
with
the
questions
i've
asked
you
and
i'm
not
unmindful
of
the
problems
that
confront
the
police.
i
hope
i'm
not.
i'm
sure
i'm
not.
could
you
tell
me
what
disadvantages
to
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
law
would
be
an
order
of
the
chief
of
police,
if
that's
his
name,
or
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
if
they
have
the
means
of
protecting
the
potential
evidence
that
they
should
not
search
outside
of
the
person
and
immediate
things
that
i
sought
of
an
extension
of
the
person,
what
should
hold
the
situation
by
appropriate
means
until
they
do
get
a
search
warrant.
please
tell
me
what
embarrassment
to
a
--
a
civilized
mode
of
law
enforcement
is
involved
if
that
procedure
became
conventional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
the
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
you
very
well
know,
do
not
constitute
a
straight
line
on
this
subject,
does
it,
maybe
an
undulating
line,
but
not
a
straight
line?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
so.
i
--
i
come
from
missouri
still,
though
that's
where
my
brother
would've
become.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
that's
my
trouble
with
this
problem.
during
the
prohibition
days,
one
talked
about
the
ingenuity
of
prohibition
violated,
narcotic
violated
are
in
--
are
astute.
petitioner's
literature
is
also
the
--
and
they're
also
astute
people.
that's
the
trouble
with
this
business
of
being
over
impressed
by
the
needs
of
--
of
quick
(inaudible)
and
carelessness,
casualness
and
often
disordered
and
that's
the
--
the
carrying
out
of
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
way
in
which
you
pressed
the
--
the
feasibility
or
desirability
of
this
kind
of
conduct,
that
when
which
you
pressed
the
position
of
the
police
and
despite
of
quarrel,
either
with
your
duty
to
do
so
or
would
there
be,
my
difficulty
is
why
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
sand,
on
the
assumption
that
you
properly
made
in
putting
the
matters
to
the
court.
is
the
question
one,
because
they
made
a
different
problem
(inaudible)
but
when
it
says,
is
the
question
one
--
would
the
question
be
one
of
statutory
construction,
namely
put
under
the
statute?
these
must
be
separately
imposed,
maybe
separately
imposed
or
like
the
--
whatever
the
name
of
that
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
a
(inaudible)
settle
the
rule
that
wouldn't
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
it
a
statutory
question
problem
that
could
dispose
of
it
without
--
with
this
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
asking
for
an
answer
because
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
want
to
know
if
this
is
a
statutory
--
if
it's
a
question
of
construction
of
the
statute,
so
that
one
may
base
that
and
not
be
confronted
with
double
jeopardy
problems
as
such
constitutionally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
could
one
construe
the
narcotics
statute.
i
don't
know
what
to
say,
but
it
disallowed
having
two
counts
for
this
kind
of
separate
units
within
a
bunch
of
--
of
alcohol
and
elicit
