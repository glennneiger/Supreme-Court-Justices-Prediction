justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
sarner,
may
i
ask
you?
however
uncertain
may
be
the
meaning
in
this
context
of
the
words
ordinary
and
necessary,
does
that
seem
uncertainty
obtained
to
the
words
business
expense?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
case
which
holds
that
an
expenditure
made
in
violation
of
the
law
could
be
a
business
expense,
whether
necessary
and
ordinary
to
the
business
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
wasn't
that
a
matter
expressly
covered
by
the
code
itself.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
doesn't
the
statute
say
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
were
these
the
fixed
amounts
of
fine
for
a
particular
violation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
raised
any
question,
mr.
solicitor,
about
the
standing
of
petitioner
to
sue
in
number
109
and
that
the
tax
was
not
imposed
by
pennsylvania
upon
him
that
one
he
voluntarily
assumed
by
contract?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
was
a
little
surprise
frankly,
for
--
to
hear
you
emphasize
the
modifying
words
of
ordinary
and
necessary
rather
than
the
real
subject,
it
seems
to
me,
business
expenses.
now,
how
far
--
is
it
not
true
that
in
last
analysis
it
must
be
a
business
expense
of
these
words
ordinary
and
usual,
merely
qualified
business
expense?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
first
of
all,
you
got
to
get
business.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then
how
can
he
find
--
well,
for
violating
a
law
be
of
business
expense.
