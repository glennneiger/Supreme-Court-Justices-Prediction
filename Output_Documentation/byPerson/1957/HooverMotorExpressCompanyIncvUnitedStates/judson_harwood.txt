mr.
judson
harwood
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
these
two
cases
have
been
consolidated,
would
i
be
out
of
order
to
ask
a
question,
shall
we
argue
currently
and,
i
understand
the
court
will
adjourn
at
4:30.
mr.
judson
harwood
and
i
naturally
would
prefer
not
to
use
all
of
my
argument
today
in
--
if
the
case
is
going
to
be
concluded
tomorrow.
i
don't
know
what
order
in
which
the
court
would
want
to
hear
the
argument
of
the
case
as
i
understand
i
have
25
minutes,
or
24
minutes
to
go.
mr.
judson
harwood
would
i
be
permitted
for
my
half
of
it
to
reserve
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
a
substantial
portion
of
my
argument.
mr.
judson
harwood
or
a
rebuttal
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
if
the
cases
will
go
until
tomorrow.
mr.
judson
harwood
if
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
case
for
the
recovery
of
corporate
income
taxes.
the
petitioner
here
is
a
motor
carrier
of
freight
and
it
holds
a
license
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
operates
pursuant
to
certificates
issued
by
the
commission.
in
the
industry,
it's
referred
to
as
a
draft
freight
or
general
commodity
carrier,
that
is
that
it
carries
in
--
in
all
commodities
tendered
to
it
by
the
public
with
a
few
exceptions
such
as
articles
and
book
and
things
of
that
nature.
the
years
involved
or
for
the
years
1951,
1952
and
1953,
the
question
here
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned
is
strictly
a
legal
question
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
bring
to
this
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals
any
of
the
record
below
except
the
technical
record.
in
1942,
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
promulgated
a
regulation
or
an
interpretation.
the
effect
of
which
was
to
permit
a
motor
carrier
to
deduct
under
section
23
(a)
of
the
revenue
act
sums
that
it
was
required
to
pay
to
various
states
because
its
vehicles
had
in
some
way
violated
the
weight
limitation
laws
of
the
states.
that
ruling
was
--
remained
in
effect
until
december
1,
1950.
at
that
time,
the
commissioner,
and
i
might
say
a
new
or
different
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
reversed
the
earlier
ruling
and
held
that
such
sums
were
not
deductible
as
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
under
section
23
(a)
of
the
--
the
revenue
act.
as
a
result
of
that
latter
interpretation,
the
agent
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
audited
the
tax
returns
for
the
petitioner,
hoover,
for
the
years
1951,
1952
and
1953.
and
insofar
as
we
are
here
concerned,
the
only
change
was
that
certain
sums
paid
by
the
petitioner
as
fines
under
the
various
statutes
of
the
various
states
through
which
it
operated,
were
disallowed
as
an
operating
expense,
an
additional
tax
was
assessed
against
petitioner
by
reason
of
the
disallowance
of
these
items
which
had
been
claimed
as
expenses.
the
petitioner
paid
the
additional
tax,
filed
a
claim
for
refund
which
as
you
know
is
a
prerequisite
to
a
suit
for
recovery.
when
the
claim
for
refund
was
denied,
a
suit
for
recovery
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
the
case
was
there
tried,
evidence
was
introduced
and
the
court
decided
the
case
adversely
to
the
contentions
of
petitioner.
and
in
doing
so,
it
made
it
unnecessary
to
transcribe
the
testimony
in
the
case.
the
petitioner,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
offered
substantial
evidence
that
--
to
the
effect
that
its
violations
or
the
fines
resulted
not
from
any
willful
act
on
its
part
or
not
from
any
negligent
act
but
in
spite
of
all
reasonable
care
that
it
could
take.
now,
the
court
below,
in
deciding
the
case,
predicated
its
decision
upon
the
assumption
that
the
petitioner
did
not
act
willfully
in
anyway
in
overloading
any
truck
nor
it
was
--
did
it
fail
to
take
all
reasonable
precautions
consistent
with
a
practical
operation
of
its
business.
did
in
spite
of
those
--
of
that
assumption,
the
district
court
held
that
to
allow
the
deduction
would
frustrate
the
enforcement
of
state
--
state
weight
acts
and
therefore
were
not
deductible.
now,
this
court
has
never
expressly
held
that,
if
i
may
refer
to
it
as
a
frustration
theory,
was
or
was
not
valid.
this
court
has
had
two
cases
in
which
it
is
discussed
and
the
first
one
was
referred
to
as
the
heininger
case
and
judge
learned
hand
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
rossman
case,
construed
that
case
as
we
contend
it
should
be
construed.
later,
this
court,
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
lilly
case
in
passing
on
that
question,
expressly
limited
the
effect
of
that
decision
insofar
as
the
commissioner
here
attempting
to
invoke
it.
i
won't
read
that
now
but
it
states
in
substance
that
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
there
may
be
a
situation
where
an
expense
is
ordinary
and
necessary
and
still
it
would
not
be
allowed
as
a
deduction
because
it
would
frustrate
some
sharply
defined
public
power
that
the
facts
in
the
lilly
case
did
not
--
were
not
in
that
category.
now,
it
is
our
position
here,
one,
that
the
revenue
act
is
a
revenue
producing
statute
and
it
is
not
a
policing
statute.
congress
never
intended
for
the
revenue
act
to
be
used
as
a
supplement
to
enforce
all
of
the
laws
of
all
of
the
states.
second,
even
if
the
frustration
theory
as
--
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court
on
two
occasions
is
sound
which
we
deny
that
even
that
would
not
permit
or
would
not
forbid
the
deductions
in
this
case.
now,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
which
affirmed
him
in
a
very
short
per
curiam
opinion
and
adopted
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
did
not
hold
that
these
expenses
were
not
ordinary
and
necessary.
they
did
not
--
they
based
the
decision
solely
on
the
fact
that
even
if
they
are
ordinary
and
necessary,
and
to
allow
them
would
frustrate
the
enforcement
of
the
state
statute.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
an
erroneous
legal
conclusion.
if
a
carrier
has
done
what
the
district
court
assumed
that
it
did,
that
is
that
it
took
all
reasonable
precautions
to
comply
with
all
of
the
state
weight
limitation
laws.
they
could
reasonably
be
expected
of
it
consistent
with
the
practical
operation
of
its
business.
if
you
take
that
assumption
of
fact,
then
the
allowance
or
disallowance
of
these
fines
as
an
expense
is
going
to
have
absolutely
no
bearing
on
future
violations
or
future
compliance.
if
it
has
no
bearing
on
future
violations
or
future
compliance,
then
it
cannot
frustrate
the
enforcement
of
that
act.
so
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
are
not
deductible
if
they
would
--
if
the
allowance
would
tend
to
frustrate
the
sharply
defined
policies
or
public
policies
of
the
state
that
even
in
--
that
would
not
preclude
the
recovery
under
the
factual
situation
under
which
we're
trying
this
case.
mr.
judson
harwood
that
is
the
theory
on
which
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
denied.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
case
that
i
think
best
analyzes
the
entire
situation
is
the
case
of
rossman
corporation
versus
commissioner
175
f.2d.
that
decision
was
written
by
judge
learned
hand
and
it
did
involve
a
penalty
under
the
opa
statute.
now,
i
have
quoted
at
length
at
pages
6,
7
and
8
of
our
brief
the
--
that
opinion.
judge
hand
in
substance
says,
“there
are
penalties
and
penalty.
some
are
deductible
and
some
are
not.”
that's
the
way
he
construes
this
court's
decision
in
the
heininger
case.
and
he
also
recognizes
the
distinction
between
an
unlawful
activity
which
has
resulted
in
an
expenditure
that
was
willful
or
negligent
and
one
that
was
non-willful
or
non-negligent.
he
states
on
the
other
hand,
“lack
of
proper
care
would
be
relevant
to
whether
the
allowance
would
frustrate
the
act.”
now,
the
commissioner
in
the
lower
courts
and
in
his
brief
here
has
made
substantial
argument
out
of
the
fact
that
the
opa
statute,
by
its
very
terms,
drew
a
distinction
between
a
willful
violation
and
a
non-willful.
well,
if
the
court
please,
that
is
true
but
the
distinction
only
went
to
the
degree
of
the
punishment.
if
you
were
willfully
violating
that
act,
you
paid
one
thing.
if
you
--
if
the
administrator
found
that
your
violation
was
not
willful,
you
paid
another
thing.
you
paid
a
smaller
amount.
mr.
judson
harwood
if
the
court
please,
we
don't
think
so.
now,
if
you
analyze
it
the
--
in
this
case
while
the
transcript
is
not
here,
the
pleadings
and
the
admission
show,
this
carrier
operates
some
200
trucks,
five
or
six
nights
a
week.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
in
this
case,
not
the
assumption
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
fines
which
were
imposed
upon
this
carrier,
resulted
in
--
from
situations
where
the
vehicle
was
well
within
the
weight
limitation
prescribed
by
the
law
of
the
states
that
imposed
the
fine.
but
during
the
transit,
that
load
in
these
large
tractor-trailers
can
shift
just
a
few
inches
one
way
or
the
other,
and
by
reason
of
that
shifting,
an
actual
violation
had
occurred.
now,
insofar
as
mid
--
mr.
judson
harwood
the
vast
majority
were.
now,
the
breakdown
of
the
fines
is
not
in
the
record
because
of
the
way
the
court
decided
the
case,
of
course,
it
is
below.
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
them
were
that
category.
now,
there
were
--
the
others
where
there
was
an
entire
overload
on
vehicle,
the
proof
showed
three
category
--
three
causes.
the
court
mentioned
two
in
its
opinion.
they
were
that
this
carrier
has
its
authority
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
not
only
authorizes
it
but
requires
it
to
serve
a
large
segment
of
population
out
in
the
old
highway.
well,
the
only
way
they
can
pick
up
freight
is
to
have
a
truck
rundown
through
a
lot
of
small
crossroad
communities
and
pick
it
up.
they
rely
on
the
weights
as
shown
on
the
bill
of
lading
until
they
get
to
a
terminal
to
weigh
it.
quite
frequently,
a
shipper
will
not
include
in
his
weight
all
of
the
weight
of
the
article.
frequently,
they
do
not
take
into
consideration
the
weight
of
the
container.
another
cause
was
that
this
being
a
continually
changing
industry
and
a
growing
industry,
the
power
units
that
are
used
from
time
to
time
changed
and
the
newer
units
were
substantially
heavier
than
the
old
ones.
and
there
were
instances
where
an
older
tractor
which
is
a
power
unit
would
breakdown
on
the
road
and
the
only
other
unit
available
sent
after
it
was
a
new
one
which
weighed
more.
mr.
judson
harwood
no,
sir.
it's
--
it's
all
involves
the
weight
limitation,
either
on
an
actual
basis
or
the
whole
vehicle
basis.
these
statutes
provide
that
you
can't
carry
one
vehicle
with
more
than
so
many
found
and
you
can't
put
more
than
so
much
of
it
on
a
particular
axle.
you
have
to
distribute
the
weight.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
--
that
this
court
in
the
lilly
case,
has
expressly
reserved
this
so-called
frustration
theory.
and
before
reading
the
language
of
this
court,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
a
number
of
cases
have
held
that
certain
expenditures
were
not
deductible,
but
if
you
get
right
down
to
it,
the
basis
of
the
decision
was
that
they
were
not
ordinary
and
necessary.
now,
in
this
particular
instance
and
in
this
industry,
it
is
impossible
for
a
carrier
to
prevent
freight
from
shifting
within
a
vehicle.
now,
if
you
were
carrying
only
one
commodity
with
one
size
and
shape
or
package
that
would
be
different.
but
a
general
commodity
carrier
that
has
all
sorts
of
sizes
and
shapes
of
--
of
shipments
on
its
truck
has
to
stack
them
in
the
best
way
that
it
can.
mr.
judson
harwood
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
companion
case
here
is
that
case.
my
--
mr.
judson
harwood
i
think
the
burden
of
--
if
--
if
--
i
think
this
court
can
decide
this
case
properly
for
the
tax
payer
on
either
of
two
theories.
one
is
that
if
a
carrier
has
incurred
an
expense
that
is
inevitable
in
the
practical
operation
of
its
business
--
mr.
judson
harwood
that
is
--
mr.
judson
harwood
there
is
certainly
some
truth
in
there.
mr.
judson
harwood
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
judson
harwood
if
the
court
please,
if
the
court
decided
it
on
that
basis,
then
i
think
if
the
burden
of
proof
in
each
instance
would
be
on
the
carrier
to
show
that
he
would
--
did
not
act
with
willful
intent
and
that
he
took
all
reasonable
precautions
that
he
could.
mr.
judson
harwood
he
would
have
to
show
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
and
if
the
commissioner
--
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
you
have
--
in
the
department,
you
have
certain
conference
procedures,
but
if
you're
not
able
to
show
it
to
his
satisfaction
and
you
still
think
that
you've
shown
it,
then
you
would
have
to
put
--
carry
that
burden
in
court
if
--
either
the
tax
court
or
in
the
district
court
depending
on
which
way
you
proceed.
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
in
one
sense
of
the
word,
the
court
--
and
in
--
this
is
particularly
true
in
this
companion
case.
if
the
court
takes
the
position
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
passing
the
revenue
act
to
differentiate
between
lawful
and
unlawful
expenditures.
it
says,
all
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
are
deductible.
now,
the
limitation
on
that
that
the
courts
have
put,
if
you
really
analyze
it,
go
back
to
the
proposition
if
they
hold
that
they
not
necessary
or
not
ordinary.
but
now
in
this
case,
neither
court
has
said
that
they
are
not
ordinary
and
necessary,
that
is
neither
the
lower
courts.
on
the
contrary,
if
it's
an
expense
that
cannot
be
avoided
in
spite
of
all
reasonable
care,
then
it
is
certainly
ordinary
and
necessary.
now,
this
court
knows
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
fixes
the
rates
that
these
carriers
can
charge.
they
have
all
sorts
of
rates.
they
have
volume
rates.
and
those
volume
rates
are
fixed
on
what
a
carrier
can
hold
in
one
load
--
what
it
cost
him
to
hold
it,
of
course,
is
the
determining
part
of
what
the
rate
will
be.
now,
you
can
avoid
it
if
you
want
to
run
half
loaded
trucks.
of
course,
you
wouldn't
have
any
income
tax
problems
if
you
did
that,
if
the
court
please.
you've
got
to
try
to
operate
your
business
with
a
practical
viewpoint.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
don't
--
i
don't
have
too
much
time
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
things.
this
court
in
the
lilly
case
says
this,
neither
--
referring
to
the
heininger
case,
says,
“neither
that
decision
nor
the
rule
suggested
by
it,
requires
disallowance
of
petitioner's
expenditures
as
deduction
in
the
instant
case.”
now,
this
is
the
importance.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that's
all
this
court
has
ever
said
about
the
so-called
frustration
doctrine.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
under
some
circumstances,
business
expenditures
which
are
ordinary
and
necessary
in
the
generally
accepted
meaning
of
those
words
may
not
be
deducted
as
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
under
23
(a)
(1)
(a)
when
they
frustrate,
sharply
define
national
or
state
policies.
the
conduct
here
does
not
fall
within
that
category.
now,
in
our
case,
if
--
if
this
case
go,
it
would
--
if
you
--
if
your
honor
should
agree
with
us,
it
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court.
i
don't
know
whether
you
would
go
through
the
court
of
appeals
or
not.
but
if
the
district
court
finds
this
effect,
which
i'm
sure
you
will,
that
we
did
not
act
with
willful
intent
and
that
we
did
take
all
practical
precautions,
then
they
can't
under
any
--
and
as
i
see
it,
there
can
be
no
frustration.
now,
we
have
one
or
two
things
that
i
think
are
material
to
show
the
congressional
intent.
the
revenue
act,
by
expressed
terms,
permits
you
to
deduct
gambling
losses
up
to
the
extent
of
gambling
games.
well
now,
the
court,
gambling
is
unlawful
in
most
of
the
states,
it's
unlawful
in
tennessee.
but
i
can
win
a
thousand
dollars
in
a
crap
game
and
i've
got
to
report
it
as
income.
i
can
go
over
and
lose
$800
in
another
crap
game
and
i
can
deduct
it,
but
that's
--
that
is
violating
the
law
of
tennessee.
now,
if
you
carry
this
to
its
ultimate
conclusion,
the
allowance
of
that
deduction
is
going
to
frustrate
the
enforcement
of
the
gambling
laws
in
tennessee.
but
congress
says,
gambling
is
that
losses
are
deductible
up
to
that
extent
without
regard
to
the
law
of
the
state.
so
we
think
that
is
material
in
determining,
“did
congress
intend
for
an
unavoidable
expense
that
is
certainly
a
business
expense?”
should
not
be
deducted
because
the
various
states
by
various
legislation
has
denominated
it
a
fine.
now,
in
that
regard,
there
are
two
or
three
things
that
i
think
are
important.
first,
kentucky
and
tennessee
are
the
states
to
which
most
of
these
fines
were
paid.
during
these
years
and
up
until
the
middle
1953,
tennessee
and
kentucky
had
much
more
restrictive
weight
limitation
laws
district
--
than
did
the
other
states
through
which
petitioner
--
mr.
judson
harwood
no,
sir.
the
statute
--
mr.
judson
harwood
the
statute
just
says
that
if
you
--
if
you
operate
a
vehicle
and
permit
it
to
be
operated
with
so
much
weight,
you're
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
they
don't
make
any
distinction
between
a
willful
and
an
innocent
victim.
mr.
judson
harwood
our
way
and
our
practice
at
home,
if
the
court
please
and
i
understand
in
kentucky,
most
of
them
have
paid
through
a
jp
who
is
more
interested
in
collecting
his
court
cost
than
he
is
to
fine.
but
nevertheless
they
are
--
they
are
denominated
under
the
statutes
as
--
as
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
misdemeanor.
mr.
judson
harwood
i
would
--
i
--
certainly,
a
business
that
is
lawful
to
the
extent
that
an
instrumentality
of
the
government
has
issued
it
a
special
license
to
operate,
is
not
a
criminal.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
three
things
very
briefly.
one,
in
1953,
tennessee
amended
its
statute
to
increase
the
loads
which
resulted
in
1953
being
the
smallest
year
that
we
involve
with
here
dollar
wise.
in
1956,
kentucky
amended
its
law,
all
of
which
raised
them
up
to
the
keeping
--
in
keeping
with
the
surrounding
states.
now,
those
changes
don't
affect
the
liability
for
the
finding
but
they
do
have
a
bearing
on
whether
the
allowance
of
these
deductions
are
going
to
frustrate
anything
in
these
states.
and
one
thing
i
think
is
quite
important,
kentucky
and
its
amendment,
if
the
court
please,
had
a
special
section
which
provides
that
a
--
an
axle
variation
not
to
exceed
5%
will
not
be
a
violation
if
the
overall
vehicle
is
within
limits.
now,
there
is
a
legislative
recognition
in
kentucky
that
a
rigid
axle
weight
is
not
realistic
in
this
industry
that
you're
going
to
have
some
leeway
and
some
shifting.
now,
there's
one
state
by
expressed
legislation
has
made
lawful
what
we
couldn't
help
but
do
proud
of
that
of
that
amendment.
now,
we
think
that's
material.
delaware
--
i
mean
indiana,
a
state
through
which
we
operate,
in
--
amended
its
act
to
remove
the
stigma
of
a
crime
and
they
made
them
all
subject
to
a
flat
$5
fine
and
the
rest
was
called
a
civil
penalty.
we
think
that
is
a
legislative
recognition
that
the
trucking
industry
is
not
run
by
criminals.
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
now,
in
our
case,
that
amendment
occurred
after
the
years
involved.
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
the
commissioner
has
ruled
in
its
regulation
which
is
copied
in
the
record
here
that
a
fine
--
and
they
treat
fines
and
penalties
in
the
same
category
in
their
brief
and
i
assume
their
position
would
be
that
even
if
it's
called
a
civil
penalty,
it's
still
would
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
would
not
be
deductible.
but
we
think,
one,
that
congress
never
intended
for
the
revenue
act
to
be
used
as
a
policing
measure
to
enforce
everybody
else
a
statute.
second,
that
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
there
is
merit
to
the
frustration
theory
that
if
--
if
a
taxpayer
has
done
all
that
he
can
reasonably
do,
there
can
be
no
frustration.
and
therefore,
that
in
either
view,
the
court
takes
of
it
that
we
are
entitled
to
recover
and
it's
an
unfair
and
an
undue
burden
to
place
on
a
carrier
to
say
that
he's
got
to
pay
a
fine
out
of
net
income
after
taxes
of
an
item
that's
just
as
much
an
expense
item
in
this
industry
as
is
gasoline
bill
is.
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
the
commissioner
would
--
i
assume
if
you
want
your
lawsuits,
you
could
deduct
your
fee,
if
you
lost
it,
you
couldn't.
i
say
that
seems
to
be
the
general
theory
of
the
department
and
i
think
that
in
a
lot
of
these
cases,
the
proof
show
that
there
--
mr.
judson
harwood
i
don't
--
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
i
don't
have
that
here.
i
don't
think
that
the
department
would
recognize
the
legal
fee
if
you
were
convicted
of
a
crime.
now,
if
you
were
acquitted,
i
think
they
would.
i
haven't
briefed
that
theory
too
fully.
but
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
legitimate
business
and
it's
a
new
business.
the
states
are
constantly
changing
and
i
think
that
for
--
for
many
years,
we
will
have
a
uniform
statute
that
will
be
applicable
all
over
the
state.
but
this
carrier
has
to
operate
from
atlanta,
georgia
across
tennessee
and
kentucky
and
to
the
middle
states
and
they've
got
four
different
weight
laws.
they
have
to
try
to
load
efficiently
in
accordance
with
the
minimum
weight
law
or
else
they
couldn't
possibly
stay
in
business.
they
have
operated
in
good
faith.
they
have
not
taken
a
calculated
risk
as
is
the
case
in
the
companion
case.
i
think
i
don't
--
i
think
his
case
has
merit.
i
think
i
was
--
has
merit.
if
he's
as
good,
certainly
i
was
as
good.
but
in
any
event,
now,
we
acted
in
good
faith
and
we
just
don't
think
congress
intended
to
deprive
us
f
that
deduction.
mr.
judson
harwood
i
was
handed
a
note
that
mr.
sarner
used
my
time.
i
didn't
know
he
was
using
my
time.
i
saved
some
from
yesterday
--
it
was
--
could
i
have
my
five
minutes?
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
i
haven't
used
25
minutes.
i
was
charged
--
mr.
judson
harwood
well,
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
--
mr.
judson
harwood
--
i
didn't
used
time
and
i
didn't
know
someone
else
was
using
my
time.
