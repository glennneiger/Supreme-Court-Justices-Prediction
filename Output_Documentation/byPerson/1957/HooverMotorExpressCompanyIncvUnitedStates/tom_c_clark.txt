what
did
you
say
the
--
in
the
second
case
of
pennsylvania
instead
of
setting
this
up
as
a
fine
and
set
it
up
as
a
road
toll
and
made
every
--
every
truck
to
pay
this
amount
before
he
go
on
the
road.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
toll
would
be
aimed
at
the
revenue
for
the
purposes
of
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
you
say
that
your
contention
is
that
this
is
aimed
to
traffic
safety.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
shifting
of
a
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
i
understand
hoover,
it's
not
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
hoover,
when
it's
not
the
gasoline
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
the
shifting
of
the
packages
that
they
pick
up
didn't
have
any
effect
as
the
record
show
or
do
you
know
on
the
safety,
the
records
of
driving
where
it
makes
--
the
truck
may
swerve?
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
the
facts
showed
beyond
dispute
that
the
man
was
in
the
gambling
business,
can
the
government
tax
him?
the
facts
showed
beyond
dispute
that
he's
in
the
gambling
business
(inaudible)
because
he
was
paying
not
so
much
for
equal
protection.
you
might
get
around
that
on
something
but
could
you
get
around
it
on
the
basis
that
it
wasn't
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expense
of
his
gambling
business
which
the
government
taxed.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
different
to
saying
it
was
not
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
even
though
it's
a
fact.
