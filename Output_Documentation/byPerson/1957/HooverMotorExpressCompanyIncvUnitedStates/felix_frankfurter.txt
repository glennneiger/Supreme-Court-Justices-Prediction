is
it
--
is
it
fair
to
say
that
if
your
view
prevailed,
somebody,
even
the
treasury
of
the
courts,
i
don't
know
who,
would
have
to
consider
--
would
have
to
determine
whether
these
are
inevitable
incidents
of
the
enterprise,
quite
innocent,
whatever
maybe
the
policy
of
restriction,
rather
than
a
blockade
running,
running
your
chances
from
not
being
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
know,
but
isn't
--
wouldn't
every
case
require
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
inevitability
depends
on
--
on
the
state
of
mind
or
the
diligence
of
--
of
the
employees
or
the
extent
to
which
he
wants
to
run
the
risk
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
overweight,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
truth
but
there
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
must
the
particular
quantity,
volume
of
truth
in
it,
will
that
be
open
for
determination
of
each
one
of
these
tax
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
whom
would
he
have
to
show
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
it
locality
and
then
he
goes
up
all
the
way
up,
maybe
to
consider
it
in
the
treasury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
are
you
suggesting
a
rule
by
which
the
necessity
of
making
those
determinations
would
be
avoided
--
could
be
avoided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
fines
pursuable
and
ordinary,
old
common
law
--
of
common
conduct,
ordinary
(inaudible)
like
a
contract
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
passing
of
debt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
didn't
mean
that
distinction
but
for
instance,
a
number
--
fines,
prohibitions
by
congress
with
a
fine
shall
define
counsel,
many
of
them,
i
don't
know
how
many
but
certainly
some
are
suable
in
the
ordinary
--
on
the
civil
side
of
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
shouldn't
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
maybe
the
difference
whether
they
are
suable
on
the
civil
side
or
whether
the
commission
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
is
what
is
denominated
civil
penalty
always
--
also
nondeductible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
yes.
i'm
just
asking
if
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
treasury
has
ruled
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
made
any
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
know
why
congress
rejects
a
proposal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
build
--
i
don't
know
why
i
take
it
out
of
view.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hear
these
arguments
frequently,
sometimes
from
the
government,
and
sometimes
the
government
opposes,
but
how
do
we
know
why
an
amendment
is
rejected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
still
--
may
i
put
this
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
public
policy,
isn't
it
just
as
fair
to
put
this
problem
if
we
have
to
--
necessary
as
in
the
self
defining
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
i've
been
here
any
number
of
times.
we
had
all
sorts
of
statutes,
so
what
is
included
in
the
conflict
if
necessary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
real
question?
so,
whenever
we
come
to
define
the
limit
or
determine
the
content,
what
is
within
the
content
are
necessary
or
is
it
ordinary
and
necessary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
stage
concept
--
conjunction
of
words,
anyhow,
ordinary
and
necessary.
the
things
maybe
ordinary,
they're
unnecessary
and
vice
versa.
whenever
we
come
to
define
and
determine
what
the
content
is,
we
have
to
take
into
consideration
relevant
factors
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
involve
that
public
policy
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
no
more
a
different
public
policy
then
other
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
--
that
gives
me
the
answer.
it
doesn't
give
me
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
don't
want
you
to
label
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
contention
of
some
extraneous
consideration
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
government
could
--
the
presupposition
of
that
--
this
whole
business
with
regard
to
gambling
game
is
that
that's
also
a
form
of
business,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
it's
a
business,
the
government
can
have
it
both
ways
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
business
for
one
purpose
and
not
for
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
(inaudible).
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
so
far
as
moral
were
concerned,
you
were
just
as
high-minded,
as
the
high-minded
people
who
violated
the
(inaudible)
act
and
so
long
as
it's
on
the
books,
you
suffer
the
consequences
of
being
prosecuted
for
that
delinquency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
the
ordinary
answer
is
whether
or
not
it
is
this
kind
of
an
expense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
--
does
it
follow
because
what
the
catholic
church
called
the
venial
defense
--
offense
are
committed
that
therefore
every
venial,
every
petty
violation
of
law
has
a
moral
stigma
to
it?
does
it
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
on
our
whole
law
and
all
our
ethics
makes
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
mean
that
--
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
insofar,
as
a
shipment
originated
in
pennsylvania
or
pennsylvania
was
the
destination,
it
was
impossible
to
comply
with
the
weight
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
--
i've
heard
it
said
but
i
don't
know,
what
is
the
authority
from
saying
that
this
was
statewide
within
pennsylvania?
justice
felix
frankfurter
statewide
infraction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
finding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
the
finding
that
it
was
statewide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
a
lot
of
people
did
but
the
fact
--
that
was
in
the
industry
infraction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
is
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
industry
is
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
other
15?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
this
--
did
i
infer
from
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
the
law
has
been
changed
in
pennsylvania.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
long
was
it
under
the
45,000
or
40,000
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
1943
to
1955?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
going
for
the
appeal
but
just
as
a
student
of
legislation.
what
efforts
were
made
by
the
industry
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
or
do
you
--
perhaps
i'm
anticipating,
so
don't
bother
to
answer
if
i
ask.
you
do
not
make
a
distinction
then
when
you
say
none
of
the
laws?
can
you
make
a
distinction
between
any
regulatory
measures,
whether
they're
potentially
dangerous
to
life
or
whether
they
are
in
the
opinion
of
the
legislature
desirable
for
some
other
public
policy
of
the
state?
all
we
ask
of
this
case
to
draw
a
line
between
deductibility
of
so-called
fines
which
the
state
for
whatever
reason
of
policy
it
may
choose
to
put
things
on
the
statute
books
as
made
the
formulated
conduct
against
public
policy
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
administrative
expenses
for
recording
things
or
things
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
--
you
know
at
least,
as
well
as
i
do
that
there's
a
few
things
more
difficult
to
determine
than
when
a
so-called
revenue
measure
is
for
purposes
of
money
or
for
purposes
of
--
of
some
other
purpose,
some
derivative
so-called
free-power
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
--
who
is
to
determine
that,
the
commissioner
each
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
--
take
narcotic
cases,
because
they
have
been
mentioned
where
drug
stores,
where
an
owner
may
be
as
innocent
as
you
are
and
he
has
to
pay
a
heavy
fine
or
may
even
go
to
jail.
now,
is
that
deductible?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
as
innocent
as
a
newborn
baby
and
under
the
law,
that
innocent
is
a
material
so
far
as
that's
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
no
prison
fine
was
imposed,
does
the
statute
permits
prison
fines?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
solicitor?
how
many
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
there
have
been
--
which
have
not
yet
come
to
this
court
if
any,
supporting
the
position
that
you're
urging
and
were
they
all
unanimous
and
over
what
period
of
time
did
this
judicial
construction
prevail?
because
i
for
one,
take
great
regard
to
construction
of
dubious
--
of
a
phrase,
general
terms
is
about
which
you
can
argue
abstract
until
the
(inaudible)
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
unanimity
of
judgment
by
court
of
appeals
over
the
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
--
if
i
understood
counsel,
this
--
the
pennsylvania
--
what
is
it?
40,000
pounds
rule
whatever
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
enforced
until
55
or
more
than
--
for
about
a
decade
of
their
regard.
and
therefore,
it
bears
on
the
argument
that
this
was
net
--
an
industry
wide
persistent,
more
or
less
inevitable.
that's
the
argument,
cause
of
conduct
and
hasn't
it
come
up
all
through
that
either
before
the
treasury
or
somewhere?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
brings
us
on
the
1945.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
still
leaves
a
decade
nearly,
between
1945
and
1955.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
hand
rule
require
that
each
particular
case,
and
i'm
not
merely
referring
to
this
kind
of
a
fine
because
this
is
a
far
reaching
problem
that
you're
presenting,
was
the
--
would
the
hand
rule
require
for
the
commissioner,
the
respective
commissioners
in
the
various
districts,
to
pass
on
the
set
of
circumstances?
i'm
inquiring.
i
draw
no
inference
from
it.
i
just
want
know
what
--
what
you
think
we're
doing
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
taxpayer
would
have
to
make
a
l
--
but
could
the
taxpayer
come
--
come
in
within
under
the
hand
rule
and
say
this
is
inadvertence,
i
give
strict
orders
to
my
employees
not
to
do
this,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
if
the
fine
was
imposed
within
--
for
the
tax
people
used
there
to
go
behind
what
the
state
has
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
--
do
the
business
expense
mean
anything
more
than
an
expense
incurred
in
the
course
of
the
conduct
of
your
business.
if
we're
going
to
go
in
chopping
up
a
business
into
--
or
turn
the
business
into
all
sorts
of
implications
that
the
words
do
not
ordinarily
carry
anybody
and
common
usually,
we
think
that
if
money
put
out
in
relation
to
the
conduct
of
your
business,
is
a
business
expense.
and
that's
why
the
qualifying
words
are
so
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
might
the
political
assessment
--
judge's
political
assessment
shared
on
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
a
case
here,
didn't
we?
in
which
we
have
to
determine
whether
judges
--
whether
a
political
assessment
imposed
upon
a
fellow
who's
running
for
a
judgeship
was
a
deductible
ordinary
and
necessary
expense
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
about
that?
there's
considerable
division
of
opinion
on
--
in
the
court
on.
what
lied
to
that
shed
that
was
running
for
officers
--
becoming
a
judge
isn't
a
business
but
certainly
is
for
purposes
to
tax
an
income.
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
not
--
we
held
it
non-deductible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughter]
wonderful
conclusion.
