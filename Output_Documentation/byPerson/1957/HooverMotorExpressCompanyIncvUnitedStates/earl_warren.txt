don't
understand
your
question.
you
--
chief

you
may
reserve
what
--
chief

--
whatever
portion
of
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice

you
may

reserve

you
wish
after

mr.

chief

earl

did
you
say
29?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
21,
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
do
you
mean
that
they
--
they
find
it
normally
and
necessary
for
them
to
violate
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
base
that
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you
this,
can
you
--
you
take
the
position
that
you
have
the
right
to
defy
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
to
tell
them
that
you
will
not
conform
to
their
laws,
that
you
will
drive
you
trucks
in
any
--
in
any
way
that
you
desire
over
their
roads
and
that
when
you
are
--
when
you
are
prosecuted
and
convicted
of
it,
that
you
can
deduct
that
as
a
--
as
an
expense,
ordinary
business
expense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
just
what
you're
saying.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
saying
that
you
can't
and
you
won't
will.
and
you
will
(voice
overlap)
by
the
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
cast
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
would
carry
that
then
under
that
theory
to
any
kind
of
offense
that
a
businessman
might
commit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
--
one
moment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
take
the
position
of
we're
a
high-minded
organization
and
everybody
knows
that
we're
moral
and
so
forth
in
transacting
at
--
an
honorable
business
and
the
next
minute,
you
say
that
you
can
--
you
can
defy
the
law,
as
the
--
as
the
liquor
violators
violated.
so,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you,
whether
you
are
in
this
legitimate
trucking
industry
or
whether
you
are
in
--
an
underworld
activities
that
there
--
that
there's
not
question
about
the
legitimacy
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
that's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
since
we
take
the
--
we
take
the
narcotic
traffic
or
the
liquor
traffic
and
the
--
and
if
a
state
has
--
has
laws
--
one
state
has
laws
then
are
--
are
more
stringent
than
its
neighbors
and
they
used
them
to
--
to
stop
the
narcotic
and
liquor
traffic,
you
say
that
because
it's
necessary
to
--
to
keep
up
with
your
competitors
and
to
--
and
to
do
business
in
an
active
way
in
that
--
in
that
state
and
in
order
for
venture
from
going
out
of
business
that
you
have
the
right
to
defy
the
laws
of
that
state,
pay
your
--
pay
your
fines
and
then
claim
them
as
a
deduction
on
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
you
kill
about
40,000
people
on
our
highways,
largely
because
of
the
use
of
--
of
these
big
trucks
on
a
highway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
--
but
that's
the
difference
of
opinion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
--
some
of
them
now
have
a
hundred
and
some
of
them
would
have
60
in
various
parts
of
the
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
depends
upon
the
kind
of
roads
that
they're
able
to
build.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
--
if
they
build
--
build
roads
that
are
--
that
will
only
support
60,000
and
the
trucking
concerns
come
in
and
defy
the
laws
of
the
state
and
tear
them
to
pieces
and
carry
weights
on
them
that
are
liable
to
shift
in
a
manner
--
on
curves
and
so
forth,
in
a
manner
that
will
--
will
take
human
life,
you
don't
call
that
hardly
that
--
an
inconsequential
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
--
that's
a
different
thing.
that's
all
i
want
to
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
what
your
position
is
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
don't
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
--
all
the
trucking
people
do
not
violate
the
law
with
impunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
--
there
are
--
there
are
some
who
will
not
hire
men
--
who
will
not
hire
men
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
violate
--
to
violate
the
law.
and
there
are
others
--
there
are
others
who
--
who
defy
the
law
openly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
you
have
suggested
they
have
the
right
to
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
do
--
what
do
you
do
between
the
other
states
where
one
has
60,000
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
other
has
100,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
not
those
things
largely
determined
by
the
--
the
kind
of
highways
that
they
build
in
the
states
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
kind
of
highways
depend
upon
the
amount
of
money
they
had
and
the
number
of
highways
they
--
they
need?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
but
do
not
some
truck
driver
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
--
in
the
industry
--
industry
by
determining
on
its
own
motion,
the
extent
to
which
it
will
violate
the
law
can
determine
for
income
tax
purposes
what
is
ordinary
and
necessary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
load
shifts
to
one
side
and
--
and
you
go
around
the
curve,
it
has
a
--
it
has
a
very
distinct
effect
on
the
equilibrium
of
the
truck,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
mr.
harwood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
if
it's
within
your
time,
you
can,
if
it
isn't,
well
you
cannot
because
we
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
keep
track
of
the
time.
your
time
has
expired,
i'm
sorry.
we'll
have
to
take
it
from
your
brief
because
we
have
people
from
out
of
town
who
were
waiting
to
be
heard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.well,
i
didn't
either.
