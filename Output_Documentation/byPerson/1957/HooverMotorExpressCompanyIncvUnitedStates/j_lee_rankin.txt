mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
ordinary
and
necessary
means
and
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
this
court
should
not
put
its
stamp
of
approval
upon
allowing
the
deduction
under
the
guise
or
theory
of
ordinary
or
--
and
necessary,
the
various
charges
that
a
law
breaker
incurs
in
running
his
business.
now,
the
effect
of
such
an
action
is
obvious,
if
you
will
follow
me
regarding
the
economics
of
the
situation,
we
are
not
for
a
moment
saying
that
federal
government
should
take
upon
itself
the
of
enforcing
all
of
the
state
laws
of
this
country.
it
has
enough
of
a
problem
as
it
is,
but
we
are
saying
that
this
court
should
not
approve
in
anyway
or
intrude
upon
the
sound
decisions
of
the
lower
court
where
they
say
that
you
can't
violate
the
laws
of
the
federal
government
of
the
state.
and
then
charge
off,
to
the
extent
of
that
federal
tax,
the
cost
of
that
violation
and
thereby
frustrate
or
reduce
the
penalty
conceived
by
the
states
and
deplete
the
enforcement
of
their
laws.
now
that's
the
issue.
in
this
case
of
the
tank
truck
company,
they
entered
upon
a
deliberate
plan
over
a
term
of
years
to
violate
the
laws
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and
they
want
the
united
states
government
and
in
the
end
result,
the
rest
of
the
taxpayers
of
this
country
to
pay
that
bill.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
preceding
case,
we
do
not
have
a
willful
violation.
the
court
did
not
make
a
finding
but
the
government's
willing
to
concede
that
there
was
not
a
willful
violation.
we
do
not
concede
that
there
were
not
ways
that
they
could
avoid
if
they
want
to
pay
the
price.
now,
the
problem
you
have
in
the
preceding
case
is
that
there
is
about
$28,000
of
fines
and
these
laws
are
not
just
made
to
protect
the
roads
or
to
get
enough
money
so
the
state
can
replace
the
road
that
a
truck
breaks
down
because
it
violates
these
laws.
they're
made
for
two
reasons,
that's
one
of
them.
the
other
reason
is
to
protect
the
life
and
safety
of
the
people
who
travel
on
those
roads
and
the
courts
have
so
held
constantly.
and
the
court
of
pennsylvania
and
third
--
third
circuit,
another
case
is
upheld
explicitly
that
that's
the
purpose
of
these
laws.
now,
when
you
take
a
truck
and
you
overload
one
of
the
assets,
there
isn't
any
question
of
what
you're
going
to
keep
pounding
and
pounding
on
that
part
of
the
truck
and
do
greater
damage
than
if
you
spread
that
load.
and
that's
the
reason
for
that
particular
provision
of
the
law.
they
say
that
they're
so
busy
picking
up
different
packages
from
over
the
country
side
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
they
can't
take
and
use
a
scale
on
those
packages.
they
just
take
the
weight
of
the
man
that
wants
to
put
a
--
any
kind
of
waste
that
he
may
have
taken
in
good
faith,
maybe
the
good
out
proper
care
and
toss
it
in
the
truck
and
proceeded.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that's
been
given
by
counsel
and
it's
shown
in
the
record
for
they're
having
overweight
on
the
one
act
in
violation
of
this
law.
another
is
that
their
weight
shifts,
during
the
shift
over
the
roads
and
they
say
that
can't
be
avoided.
now,
if
the
space
were
large
enough
so
that
it
would
cut
in
to
their
net
property
in
a
very
substantial
way
and
they
could
use
--
they
could
see
that
they
might
save
it.
don't
you
think
they
could
put
a
scale
off
in
the
countryside
and
take
a
couple
of
minutes
to
weigh
it
and
see
that
they
didn't
violate
this
law
or
don't
you
think
they
could
have
a
compartment
or
several
compartments
in
their
truck
or
ways
of
holding
this
merchandise
so
it
wouldn't
shift?
if
it
involved
enough
money
in
the
trucking
business
in
the
way
of
fines,
so
it
was
worthwhile?
but
the
first
petitioner
comes
here
with
a
$6
million
annual
business
and
his
total
fines
for
the
three
years,
$28,000.
now,
i
think
if
you
will
just
consider
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
the
hoover.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
will
agree
with
me
that
they
just
sat
down
and
figured
out
on
their
gross
and
on
their
net
what
amount
$28,000
was
to
a
$6
million
gross
take
and
whether
or
not
it
was
worth
the
cost
of
trying
to
comply
with
this
law.
and
if
you
cut
that
in
half
like
we
do
in
the
corporation
laws
by
approving
that
kind
of
conduct,
you
will
find
that
none
of
the
laws
will
be
evaded
in
regard
of
the
things
of
that
character.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
lower
courts
have
drawn
this
kind
of
a
line
and
i
think
the
o.p.a.cases
demonstrate
it
and
i
think
there's
some
sense
to
it.
when
the
charge,
the
o.p.a.cases
are
civil
cases,
when
the
charge
is
in
the
nature
of
compensation
to
try
to
make
up
for
the
extent
that's
involved
to
the
state
or
to
the
individual,
they
have
not
treated
and
the
court's
have
not
treated
as
far
as
deduction
is
concerned
on
the
same
basis
as
they
have
when
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
penalty
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
or
to
replenish
something
that
would
be
destroyed
or
something
of
that
character.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
they
do
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
no.
it
appears
clearly
in
the
o.p.a.
if
you
recall
in
the
early
days
of
the
o.p.a.in
the
rossman
case
period,
the
administrator
interpreted
to
the
law
that
if
there
was
treble
damages
involved,
that
was
a
penalty,
that
was
because
there
was
a
willful
violation
that
was
found
and
they
were
trying
to
stop
other
people
from
willful
violations
and
including
this
person
and
they
therefore,
the
courts
have
held,
you
can't
deduct
that
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expense.
but
if
the
single
amount
was
involved,
they
said
you
could
because
that
was
only
an
element
of
the
government
trying
to
recover
an
unjust
enrichment
of
the
tax
--
taxpayer
involved.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
the
law
itself
does
not
recognize
the
distinction
between
willfulness
or
non-willfulness,
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
it's
the
legislature
that
that
question
should
be
addressed
to
it
if
you
want
to
have
some
relief.
but
oftentimes,
the
legislature
does
not
want
to
permit,
(a)
to
go
out
and
say,
“i
don't
care
what
happens,
i'm
going
to
run
my
business
in
such
a
way
that
whether
i'm
abiding
by
the
law
or
not
abiding
by
it,
whether
i'm
innocent
or
not,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
me,
i'm
not
going
to
try.”
and
so
the
legislature
says
whether
you're
innocent,
willful
or
not
willful,
you
pay
the
fine.
and
i
think
in
the
legislative
judgment,
they're
trying
to
handle
it
in
that
manner
with
the
idea
if
it
will
be
determined.
and
the
moment
that
you
give
the
benefit
of
the
tax
deduction
which
in
corporations
it's
52%
today
and
it's
a
much
more
important
element
with
it
--
with
that
much
involved
than
it
was
in
the
earlier
days
when
the
tax
was
much
less.
but
if
you
take
that
much
out
of
this
determined,
you
take
50%
out
of
it
and
it
just
becomes
an
attractive
thing
which
does
from
amongst
dollar
and
cents
proposition.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
was
the
--
the
contention
that
has
been
argued
by
counsel
in
their
brief
to
some
extent
and
the
courts
have
treated
it
differently
if
it
was
only
a
road
toll.
and
the
commissioner,
in
his
first
ruling
was
referred
to
by
counsel,
treated
it
as
though
it
was
a
road
toll.
and
then
when
he
revived
and
reversed
that
ruling
in
1950,
december,
he
said
that
the
--
he‘s
been
an
error
--
the
commission
had
been
in
error
in
assuming
that
it
was
just
a
toll
because
he
had
assumed
that
there
could
be
a
permit
obtained
for
the
larger
amount
and
that
wasn't
true.
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
determine
to
penalize
and
therefore,
there
should
be
no
deductions
and
that
was
the
expressed
ruling.
i
think
there's
an
entirely
different
situation
in
the
nature
of
the
toll.
but
let
me
demonstrate
to
you,
what
would
happen
in
this
case
if
it
was
a
toll.
these
people
have
77,000
trips
in
this
one
year
tax
--
taxable
year,
77,000
trips.
how
many
times
would
they
pay
a
fine?
711.
now,
they
conceived
that
60%
of
the
time
in
the
summer
they
were
overweight
in
violation
and
75%
of
the
time
in
the
winter.
now,
just
take
the
60%
figure
and
you
got
somewhere
around
42,000
to
45,000
times
that
they
made
trips
that
they
were
in
violation
knowing
every
mile
that
they
traverse
to
the
state
they
were
in
violation
of
the
law
and
they
paid
fines
the
times
they
got
caught,
711.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
it's
graduated
if
it's
higher
but
it
isn't
very
large.
and
there
were
no
imprisonments
imposed
on
them
and
they
even
made
a
contract
with
their
employees,
labor
contract
whereby
they
would
agree
to
pay
these
fines
that
were
not
imposed
on
the
company
but
were
imposed
upon
the
employees
that
drove
the
trucks.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
not
--
no,
it
did
not,
so
that
you
see
if
you
talk
about
tolls,
these
people
weren't
paying
any
kind
of
toll,
they
paid
on
such
occasions
as
they
got
caught.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
both.
the
--
the
maintenance
and
protection
of
the
roads
and
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
and
that
third
circuit
which
we
think
this
court
would
respect
and
follow
have
both
held
that
those
were
the
two
elements
that
this
--
these
particular
laws
of
pennsylvania
were
addressed
to.
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
it
and
they
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
just
recovering
whatever
was
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
roads.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
i
know
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
consider
that
that
hasn't
effect
on
maintenance
and
safety
both.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
record
doesn't
show.
i
would
argue
my
--
in
my
own
experience
that
that
makes
it
more
difficult
to
keep
the
truck
properly
on
the
road
and
the
--
that
it
was
more
of
a
hazard
to
anybody
driving
near
it
and
including
the
driver
himself
but
that's
just
my
own
experience
and
it
maybe
wrong,
i'm
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i
think
and
there's
no
question
in
the
tank
truck
case,
that
its
--
the
evidence
shows
that
if
the
oil
was
not
filled
to
capacity
in
that
truck
that
the
shifting
of
that
kind
of
a
load
would
clearly
be
a
--
a
hazard
to
the
truck
and
anybody
near
it.
and
i
would
think
that
the
mere
fact
it
was
a
package
instead
of
oil
would
no
--
make
no
difference
from
the
physics
of
the
matter.
now,
this
court
has
not
passed
squarely
from
this
question
but
in
several
cases,
it
has
come
up
to
the
proposition
and
certainly
to
the
government
indicated
that
it
would
not
tolerate
the
deduction
which
would
frustrate
a
public
policy
if
it
was
sharply
defined.
now,
the
lilly
case,
the
court
was
very
explicit
to
state
in
that
case
that
the
reason
they
allowed
the
deductions
for
the
payments
to
the
doctrine
in
connection
with
these
eyeglasses
was
because
there
was
no
declaration,
either
federal
or
state
of
any
sharply
defined
policies.
and
the
court
very
carefully
said
that
it
was
not
in
any
way
approving
this
practice
which
had
been
condemned
by
the
industry
by
that
time
and
was
reflected
on
and
so
forth.
but
the
court
found
that
at
the
time
involved
in
the
deductions,
there
had
become
no
sharply
defined
policy.
now,
the
government's
position
is
not
that
any
policy
that
seems
to
be
unattractive
should
be
the
basis
for
this
action.
we're
talking
on
the
thing
that's
involved
in
this
cases
is
a
sharply
defined
policy
as
declared
by
a
state
or
federal
legislature
where
anybody
concede
and
there
isn't
any
question
in
these
cases
but
what
this
very
parties
knew
what
the
law
was
and
the
tank
truck
started
out
to
deliberately
violate
it
and
the
other
people
didn't
seem
to
care
enough
to
take
the
steps
at
the
cause
that
it
would
have
been
to
in
order
to
comply
with
the
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
in
the
hoover
case
did
not
find
whether
it
was
willful
or
non-willful.
but
it
said
that
it
--
it
--
in
its
opinion,
it
would
make
no
difference
so
it
made
no
finding
on
that
question.
in
the
tank
truck,
it
was
admitted
by
everybody.
it
was
deliberate
and
purposely
done
because
it
was
conceived
that
that's
the
only
way
they
could
conduct
their
business
and
stay
in
business.
and
on
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
to
face
up
to
the
proposition
that
if
this
kind
of
a
deduction
is
allowed,
businessmen
can
come
to
this
court
and
say
we
--
we
had
to
violate
this
law
or
we
--
it
was
attracted
to
violate
this
law
and
they're
certain,
you
can
take,
go
down
the
statute
books
either
federal
or
state.
and
you
can
find
dozens
of
laws
that
businessmen
can
make
a
lot
more
money
if
there
can
be
free
to
violate
and
charge
the
expense
to
somebody
else.
and
they
wind
up
in
this
kind
of
operation
with
the
general
taxpayers
of
this
country
having
to
make
it
up.
now,
we're
talking
about
the
--
in
these
cases
a
substantial
amount
of
money
in
taxes
but
if
you'll
look
at
in
the
brief,
you'll
see
the
record
as
to
what
defines
for
violation
of
this
maximum
truck
laws
were
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
during
this
period
of
this
year.
and
you'll
find
that
that
was
over
a
million
dollars.
now,
if
this
can
be
approved
for
the
tank
truck
people,
certainly,
all
businessmen
that
had
any
kind
of
a
profit
would
be
entitled
of
the
same
deduction
in
the
trucking
business
which
would
mean
in
prosperous
times
like
we've
had
that
such
a
rule
would
take
a
million
--
$200,000
cut
it
in
half
and
you
transfer
that
load
under
the
--
under
the
other
taxpayers
in
the
country.
that's
the
only
place
that
you
can
do
--
get
it
because
it
has
to
be
made
up
to
carry
the
government.
now
that
--
the
courts
over
a
number
of
years
have
taken
the
position
that
they
just
would
not
approve
a
course
of
action
which
frustrated
a
public
policy
that
was
clearly
defined.
and
the
problem
has
been
what
it
was
clearly
defined
and
they
have
initiated
and
taken
that
action
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
isn't
only
a
matter
of
regulation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can't
answer
the
question
about
the
number
of
courts
of
appeals.
the
only
other
one
that
i
recall
offhand
is
judge
hand's
decision
that's
been
referred
to
here,
which
--
in
which
he
clearly
recognized
the
principle
and
said
it
was
a
question
of
ad
hoc
consideration
in
each
case
and
dealt
with
the
proposition
in
that
case
of
being
a
single
amount,
not
treble
damage
as
being
compensatory
and
therefore
outside
of
the
ordinary
rule.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
have
a
problem
in
that
period
in
regard
to
the
war
period
and
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
there
was
such
restrictions
on
the
kind
of
trucks
that
you
could
get,
trailers
that
the
difficulty
with
compliance
was
recognized
by
the
state
during
the
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we're
dealing
with
51
here.
and
the
change
by
the
commissioner
was
at
the
close
of
1950
when
there
wasn't
any
question
of
what
they
could
have
got
at
that
time
equipment
to
comply
with
the
law.
so
at
that
period,
there
was
a
different
situation.
now,
up
to
1950,
you
see,
you
had
the
commissioner's
ruling
that
would
permit
them
to
have
it
and
the
moment
after
the
ruling
was
reversed,
we
have
this
case
in
1951
that
squarely
deals
with
it.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
had
no
difficulty
and
the
sixth
circuit
had
no
difficulty
holding
against
the
petitioner's
in
both
of
these
cases.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
that
the
hand
rule
would
involve
that
kind
of
a
problem.
i
think,
if
the
commissioner
would
find
that
it
was
a
--
a
fine
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty,
either
under
state
or
federal
law
that
to
allow
the
deduction
would
not
be
ordinary
and
necessary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
hand's
opinion
that
i
see
that
would
indicate
any
recognition
if
there
was
a
fine
or
penalty
that
the
legislature
imposed
as
determined
that
you
would
disregard
that
and
allow
it
to
be
deducted.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
now
if
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
if
this
fine,
there's
something
wrong
with
it,
if
you
can't
run
your
business
and
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
law,
it
seems
to
me
there
--
that
question
should
be
addressed
either
to
the
legislature
or
the
court
where
you
get
the
fine
if
it's
a
violation
of
due
process
because
it's
impossible
to
run
a
business
and
comply
with
the
law
or
some
other
legal
interference
with
it
being
valid.
the
proper
place
is
to
raise
it
in
that
court
and
try
to
establish
that
it's
not
a
valid
fine
or
statute.
but
that
isn't
the
case
here.
they
didn't
raise
that
at
all,
they
just
proceed
to
pay
it.
and
they
made
a
deal
with
their
employees
in
the
tank
trucks
but
they
had
paid
their
fines
for
them
to
take
care
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
are
two
with
the
government
and
one
against.
the
next
case
involved
the
seventh
circuit
that
is
against.
there
are
great
many
lower
courts
and
i
think
that
when
justice
holmes
in
the
sullivan
case
said
that
there'd
be
time
enough
to
deal
with
this
problem
when
the
taxpayer
had
them
to
merit
it
and
bring
it
before
the
courts
that
each
cared
of
a
good
many
--
that
might
have
been
here
earlier.
it
seems
to
me
it
was
pretty
clear
what
he
thought
at
least,
whether
the
whole
court
felt
that
or
not
of
such
a
contention
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
your
pardon?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
that's
the
next
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
the
wages
for
recording
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
think
that
there
--
it's
a
different
problem.
but
we
think
that
they're
both
governed
by
the
same
general
rule
but
the
court
could
consider
that
as
different
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that
involves
payments
that
were
in
direct
violation
of
the
statute
to
induce
the
commission
of
--
of
crimes.
that's
the
issue
there.
we
think
that's
more
aggravated
than
these
that
are
incidental
in
the
nature
of
fines
and
penalties.
but
even
in
the
seventh
circuit
--
the
seventh
circuit
referred
to
fines
and
penalties
and
said
those
are
concomitant
expenses
and
those,
of
course,
would
not
be
deducted.
so
that
to
that
extent
on
this
kind
of
a
case,
apparently
the
seventh
circuit
would
agree,
that
these
particular
charges
were
not
deductible
in
any
event
because
they
expressly
referred
to
fines
and
penalties
as
being
concomitant
expenses
and
not
as
they
call
it,
the
integral
expenses.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
refer
to
that
in
the
brief
and
we
said
--
say
that,
of
course,
if
they're
not
his
expenses,
they're
his
not
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
true.
the
--
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
you
recognize
this
agreement
as
creating
it
and
causing
it
to
be
a
business
expense
of
this
particular
taxpayer.
then
if
you
do
find
that
fact,
however,
you
still
have
to
find
that
it's
ordinary
and
necessary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
a
question
of
whether
this
court
is
going
to
recognize
that
it's
the
business
expense
for
men
to
violate
the
law
and
pay
fines
for
it
in
the
conduct
of
business
in
this
country.
now,
that's
the
issue
that's
put
up
to
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
oftentimes
or
usually,
the
court
has
dealt
with
this
under
the
ordinary
and
necessary
language
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
--
as
to
that
being
controlling.
it's
the
government's
position
that
it
is
not
ordinary
and
necessary
for
men
to
violate
the
law
in
this
country
and
that
therefore,
since
they
don't
come
within
that
qualification
of
the
statute,
they're
not
entitled
to
the
deduction
and
the
grant
from
the
--
the
deduction
would
be
to
interfere
with
the
enforcement
of
the
state
laws
and
make
it
very
difficult
to
apply
them
and
have
them
effective.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
courts
have
generally
held
that
extortion
payments,
as
well
as
bribes,
lobbying
expense
and
all
payments
of
that
character
were
not
deductible
but
they
are
not
ordinary
and
necessary
to
business
and
the
court
just
wouldn't
recognize
it
as
such.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
courts
have
said
that
no
matter
how
much
he
said,
i
can't
run
my
business
and
actually,
this
court
dealt
with
that
very
problem
in
the
textile
mills
case
because
if
you
will
recall
that
case
with
the
question
of
lobbying
to
try
to
get
the
return
of
the
alien
property.
and
the
corporation
undertook
to
try
to
lobby
that
through
the
congress
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
under
23
(a),
they
could
deduct
the
amount
of
money
that
they
paid
to
a
publicist
and
two
lawyers.
now,
their
contract
provided
they
would
lobby
this
very
thing
through
congress
and
they
got
it
done.
and
certainly,
it
was
ordinary
and
necessary
and
it
was
an
integral
part
of
what
they
were
trying
to
do
under
their
contract,
to
try
to
get
that
legislation
through
and
the
only
way
they
could
do
it
is
by
using
such
personnel.
and
this
court
said
that
would
frustrate
the
policy
to
permit
anything
of
that
character.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
because
you
put
a
gloss
on
ordinary
and
necessary
in
that
situation.
the
court
says,
“we
will
not
recognize
the
idea
that
it's
ordinary
and
necessary
to
frustrate
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
the
states.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
believe
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
in
the
next
case
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
