mr.
leonard
sarner
if
your
honors
please.
you'll
recall
that
mr.
harwood
was
presenting
the
argument
--
part
of
the
argument
on
behalf
of
both
these
carriers
and
he
has
a
little
time
left.
he'd
like
to
reserve
that
until
the
end
of
the
argument
to
present
these
points.
if
you
will
read
now
to
these
--
these
cases
involved
the
deductibility
for
income
tax
purposes
of
fines
paid
to
various
states
were
operating
on
a
highways
at
these
states,
motor
vehicles
which
exceeded
the
maximum
weights
or
actual
weight
limitations
prescribed
by
the
states.
the
--
they
raised
the
problem
with
the
allied
case,
cases
of
sullivan,
massei
and
ross
of
the
use
of
a
public
policy
rationale
or
as
the
government
is
raising
in
the
allied
cases,
payments
which
are
made
for
the
--
to
obtain
the
commission
of
a
crime
by
the
recipient
as
being
excluded
from
this
concept
of
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
for
purposes
of
deduction.
of
course,
i
think,
we'll
all
agree
that
the
use
of
public
policy
that
to
allow
us
for
example
to
deduct
these
fines
in
someway
remits,
reduces
the
punishment
using
it
in
a
broad
sense
which
the
state
has
imposed
upon
us
for
exceeding
this
weight
laws
or
its
subsidiary
that
you
can't
deduct
illegal
payments
and
i
call
your
attention
your
honors
that
this
is
a
subsidiary
argument
and
subsidiary
rationale.
the
reason
why
illegal
payments
if
they
cannot
be
deducted
would
depend
again
on
the
fact
that
it
frustrates
the
policy
of
the
state
which
makes
this
activity
for
which
the
payment
has
made
a
particular
crime
or
proscribes
its
commission,
of
course,
this
has
a
smooth
sounding
clause
ability.
i
mean
it
may
shock
all
of
us,
most
of
us,
that
businessmen
will
transgress
the
law
and
that
when
they're
following
for
this
transgression,
when
they're
so-called
punished
for
the
transgression
or
when
they
want
to
make
payments
which
are
proscribed,
which
are
designated
possibly
a
crime
or
some
sort
of
prohibited
activity
that
the
tax
law
should
so
recognize
these
payments
as
to
allow
that
deductibility
in
computing
the
revenue,
the
amount
which
has
to
be
paid
to
the
government.
but
your
honors,
this
use
of
public
policy
or
this
use
of
an
illegal
payment
by
the
government
in
these
cases
which
has
been,
to
some
extent
as
we
all
see,
developed
in
a
very
confusing
way
by
the
courts
is
a
completely
foreign
concept
to
the
purposes,
to
the
intendment
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
i'd
like
your
honors
to
look
at
page
21
of
our
brief.
we
quote
what
the
congress
--
what
the
committee
of
congress
was
considering
when
the
original
1913
bill
was
passed
after
the
enactment
of
the
sixteenth
amendment.
and
at
this
time,
it
was
suggested
by
senator
starling
that
there
should
be
some
amendments
to
the
bill
which
would
limit
the
deductibility
of
expenses
in
computing
income
to
legal
expenses,
to
a
legal
trade
or
business.
and
senator
williams,
who
was
a
ranking
member
of
the
committee
at
that
time,
said
the
object
of
this
bill
is
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
on
page
21.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
he
said
the
object
of
this
bill
is
to
tax
a
man's
net
income.
that
is
to
say,
what
he
has
at
the
end
of
the
year
after
deducting
from
his
receipts,
his
expenditures
or
losses.
it
is
not
to
reform
man's
moral
characters,
that
is
not
the
object
of
the
bill
at
all.
the
tax
is
not
levied
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
people
from
betting
on
horse
races
or
upon
futures,
but
the
tax
is
framed
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
man
pay
upon
his
net
income,
his
actual
profit
during
the
year.
the
law
does
not
care
where
he
got
it
form,
so
far
as
the
tax
is
concerned
although
the
law
may
very
properly
care
in
another
way.
now,
i'm
sure
that
my
friends
representing
the
--
the
respondents
in
sullivan,
ross
and
massei
will
amplify
this
concept
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
various
times
that
it
was
sought
by
the
congress,
by
some
members
of
congress
to
proscribe
the
concept
of
ordinary
and
necessary
by
a
limitation
that
it
can't
be
some
sort
of
an
illegal
expense
and
all
of
these
times,
this
was
rejected
by
the
congress.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
we
made
up
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well
we
do
--
we
know
in
one
sense
insofar
in
1951
your
honors
will
see
when
i'm
sure
the
--
other
counsel
raised
the
point,
senator
(inaudible)
attempted
to
have
an
actual
limitation
on
deductibility
of
expenses,
denying
any
expenses
incurred
in
the
operation
of
illegal
wagering
or
gambling.
and
the
debates
at
that
point
of
time
point
out
that
this
actually
would
amount
to
a
tax
on
gross
income,
not
on
net
income
which
is
the
intendment
of
the
revenue
act.
it's
not
to
enforce
the
--
the
particular
penalty
provisions
or
the
public
policies
of
the
--
of
the
criminal
laws
of
the
states,
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
and
there
are
many
effective
ways
to
do
that
and
that
the
object
of
the
income
tax
law,
regardless
of
what
maybe
the
objects
of
other
so-called
revenue
measures
is
to
produce
the
fair
share
of
income
which
a
man
should
pay.
mr.
leonard
sarner
surely.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
sir.
mr.
leonard
sarner
surely.
mr.
leonard
sarner
ordinary
and
necessary.
mr.
leonard
sarner
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
sarner
well
i
--
that's
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
sir.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
well
i
think
i
can
give
you
the
answer,
your
honor,
and
of
course
that's
what
i
--
i
hope
to
do.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well
it
isn't
--
it
is
an
extraneous
consideration
and
the
context
that
it's
used
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
by
the
weights
then
used
by
the
lower
courts
in
our
two
cases,
it's
completely
foreign
and
extraneous
concept
having
no
bail
as
we
all
see
in
any
workable
rule
whatsoever.
but
i
just
--
before
i
--
and
i'll
answer
that
in
one
moment.
i
do
want
to
make
one
further
point,
because
this
runs
through
the,
seems
to
me,
through
the
entire
government's
position.
they
take
the
view
that
just
because
an
expenditure
is
economically
involved
or
integral,
so
intertwined
with
the
production
of
the
income
that
in
and
of
itself
does
not
make
the
expense
deductible
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
we
agreed
the
three
quarters
of
--
of
some
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
are
made
or
what
i
say
is
the
straw
premise,
we
don't
deny
that
merely
because
an
expenditure
is
economically
involved
in
the
production
of
income
that
it
is
automatically
deductible.
we
admit
that
it
must
be
ordinary
and
necessary,
and
here
an
answer
to
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
we
come
to
the
point
of
the
role
that
public
policy
in
the
context
that
its
used
by
these
courts
and
by
the
respondent
that
in
someway
the
--
the
states
set
forth
a
policy
and
to
allow
an
income
tax
deduction
of
expenditures
made
which
may
be
in
violation
of
that
policy,
frustrates,
prevents,
interferes
with
the
states'
enforcement.
that's
the
sense
that‘s
used
in
this
so-called
public
policy
rationale.
mr.
leonard
sarner
possibly
the
same
--
sure
i
would
say
the
same
uncertainty
does
obtain
but
i
don't
think
your
honor
that
there
is
this
much
uncertainty
as
--
as
to
the
meaning
of
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses.
we
have
had
your
honors
have
decided
a
number
of
cases
insofar
as
the
business
aspect
is,
what
is
a
business
expense,
the
kornhauser
case
points
out
that
if
it's
approximately
results
from
--
is
connected
with
--
directly
connected
with
the
business,
it
is
a
business
expense.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
it
depends
what
you
mean,
your
honor.
in
violation
--
in
violation
of
law
and
violation
of
law
has
a
lot
different
meanings.
there
are
have
been
--
there
had
been
cases
for
example
--
well,
you
take
the
ross,
sullivan
and
--
and
massei
cases
which
will
be
presented
to
you.
their
expenditures
under
the
government's
view
were
made
by
the
taxpayer
engaged
in
illegal
book
making,
wagering
to
employees
in
the
expenditure
itself
aside
from
the
activity
of
the
taxpayer
being
to
get
the
employee
to
himself
commit
the
crime,
that's
independently
made
a
crime.
seventh
circuit
said
that
this
is
no
question
that
this
is
a
deductable
ordinary
--
no
they
admitted
it
was
a
business
expense,
it
was
a
question
of
whether
it
was
ordinary
and
necessary
expense.
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
rent
in
the
--
in
the
sullivan
and
massei
cases.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
the
--
the
--
that's
the
taxpayer's
argument,
that
insofar
as
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
--
insofar
as
salaries
and
rental
concern,
the
taxpayer
says
that
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
take
any
position
contrary
to
his.
but
i
think
that
the
government
probably
will
point
out
to
your
honors
that
--
that
salaries
and
rents
don't
embrace
anything
further.
these
are
just
illustrative
of
typical
types
of
business
expenses
which
have
further
limitations
on
them
that
salaries
must
be
reasonable.
rent
must
be
not
connected
with
buying
the
business,
buying
the
property
but
merely
for
using
it.
i
don't
personally
think
that
--
that
--
that
is
the
touchstone
the
fact
that
the
code
happens
to
designate
salary
or
rent
as
such.
but
to
come
back
to
what
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
in
a
big
sense,
public
policy
and
illegality
plays
a
very
important
part
in
what
is
ordinary
and
necessary.
that
is
when
the
law
of
a
state,
where
people
are
doing
business,
proscribed
certain
conduct,
when
societies
for
example,
professional
societies
frown
upon
certain
conduct,
this
puts
a
general
limitation
on
what
people
ordinarily
and
normally
do.
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
it's
illegal
to
--
to
make
certain
types
of
payments
generally,
in
the
business
community,
in
the
reputable
business
community,
people
will
not
make
those
certain
types
of
payments.
but
the
concept
of
--
and
to
that
extent,
it
plays
into
the
concept
of
ordinary
and
necessary
because
ordinary,
as
your
honors
have
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
cases,
means
common,
frequent,
normal,
usual
in
this
particular
type
of
business
and
i
agree
that
in
a
--
in
a
normal
let
us
say,
in
the
normal
legitimate
business,
it
is
unusual,
it
is
not
common,
it
is
not
frequent
to
find
that
the
taxpayer
is
bribing
public
officials
to
get
state
contracts
to
find
that
the
--
that
the
taxpayer
is
--
is
otherwise
violating
the
law
in
his
expenditures.
and
hence,
it's
not
that
the
state
proscribes
this
and
says,
“this
is
a
--
a
criminal
act
or
this
is
a
penalty,
we
punish
you
for
doing
this.”
this
sets
the
normal
pattern
of
what
people
do
in
the
business
community,
the
community
with
which
we
are
particularly
interested.
but
this
court
has
also
pointed
out,
your
honors,
in
the
--
in
the
lilly
case,
the
heininger
case,
you
pointed
out
that
what
is
ordinary
and
normal
means
for
a
particular
business.
and
therefore,
if
you
have
in
the
gamblers
cases,
i
have
no
doubt
if
you
have
an
illegal
business
and
you
do
have
expenses
which
are
integral
and
normal
and
common,
assuming
you
as
--
you
work
with
the
assumption
that
you
do
have
the
illegal
business
operating,
that
government
for
purposes
of
revenue,
for
tax
purposes
is
interested
and
so
intended,
when
it
enacted
the
revenue
act
to
take
just
the
net
amount
of
the
income.
mr.
leonard
sarner
surely.
oh,
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
it
can't
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
that
exactly
right.
in
mr.
harwood,
you
may
recall
yesterday,
pointed
out
on
the
wagering
that
wagering
losses
are
admittedly
deductible
as
against
wagering
expenses
--
as
against
wagering
gains.
recognizing
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
why
because
the
whole
object
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
to
tax
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
tax
a
man's
net
income.
that's
right.
but
still
we
must
--
we
still
--
presented
here
with
defining
the
limits
as
to
what
expenses
can
be
deducted.
and
i
think
that
those
limits,
you
can
use
public
policy,
you
can
use
legality
or
illegality
not
in
the
sense
that
the
lower
court's
have
used
it
or
not
in
the
sense
that
the
government
is
going
to
urge
here
as
an
independent
ground
for
--
as
an
independent
ground
for
disallowing
the
deduction,
not
at
all,
but
to
fine
in
the
context
of
what
is
proscribed
by
the
state,
what
do
the
people
in
this
very
industry
normally,
commonly,
frequently
find
it
necessary
to
do.
now,
you
take
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
positively.
now,
that's
--
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
you
--
you
take
our
very
case,
your
honor.
the
tank
truck
case
involves
motor
carriers
of
bulk
liquid
that
is
gasoline,
kerosene
the
fuel
oils.
all
the
equipment
in
the
taxable
year
in
1951
was
completely
standardized
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
during
the
world
war
ii
years,
there
were
restrictions
on
the
production
of
steel
and
on
the
making
of
these
tank
trucks
of
the
trailer
trucks
so
that
a
uniform
size
of
tanks,
some
4500
to
5000
gallons
was
the
only
type
of
equipment
available
and
the
only
type
of
equipment
used
in
the
taxable
year.
the
rates
of
the
entire
industry
are
predicated
upon
the
carriage
of
a
minimum
of
4500
gallons.
pennsylvania,
for
reasons
of
its
own,
of
all
the
other
states
with
which
our
industry
operated
and
we
represent
in
this
case
the
--
the
substantial
--
carriers
of
the
substantial
amount
of
bulk
liquids
in
the
pennsylvania,
new
jersey,
delaware,
west
virginia,
ohio.
pennsylvania,
of
all
these
states
had
a
maximum
weight
of
4500
gallons.
all
the
other
states
had
some
60000
gallons
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
gallons
--
six
--
to
pounds
--
pounds,
i'm
sorry.
the
weight
of
the
--
of
the
liquids
were,
of
course,
standardized.
whenever
our
carriers
carried
anything
but
gasoline,
they
were
over
the
weight
set
in
pennsylvania.
so,
whenever
--
obviously,
and
we
carry
gasoline
in
the
summer,
some
35%
of
the
times
and
the
winter
only
25%.
so,
between
65%
and
75%
of
the
time
that
we
either
came
into
pennsylvania
or
left
pennsylvania
for
one
of
the
other
states,
we
we're
violating
the
pennsylvania
weight
limitation
law.
we
knew
it,
we
had
to
buy.
now,
why
did
we
find
it
necessary?
as
i
say,
it
was
a
question
could
we
have
increased
the
rates?
the
--
we
--
i
think,
the
government
can
see
what
the
tax
court
found,
that
if
we
have
particular
company,
had
increased
the
rates,
this
would
have
referred
the
business
to
the
other
carriers,
we
would
have
gone
out
of
business,
the
exact
phrase.
if
the
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
now,
--
of
course
the
--
the
lilly
case
pointed
--
answered
that
argument.i
f
you
recall
the
lilly
case,
it
was
in
our
petition,
who
--
opticians
were
making
kickbacks
or
facts
to
physicians.
and
the
argument
was
that
--
well
of
this
optician,
this
taxpayer
had
refused
to
make
the
kickbacks
then
he
would
have
--
the
business
would
have
been
referred
to
other
opticians
and
the
argument
was,
well,
then
all
of
them
would
have
refused.
well,
it
so
happens
that
an
economic
reality
--
if
we
had
increased
the
rates,
the
others
would
have
continued
to
operate
the
same
and
we
would
have
gone
out
of
business.
but
the
answer
is
just
as
well
for
the
others.
insofar
as
the
industry
is
concerned,
it
was
impossible
for
the
industry
to
keep
--
to
increase
the
rates.
the
rates
are
so
geared
to
the
railroad
rates
and
are
so
geared
to
the
rates
of
private
carriers,
that
is
the
oil
companies
themselves
have
private
--
have
their
own
fleet
of
trucks
where
the
--
over
the
road
industry.
we
don't
carry
just
within
--
within
a
municipality
but
within
a
state
from
one
city
to
another
or
interstate
of
course.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
sir.
this
--
this
is
--
this
--
every
the
long
established,
complete
practice
in
pennsylvania
was
to
fill
the
load
--
the
trucks,
the
capacity
to
have
this
4500
gallons
of
--
of
freight
of
oil
--
of
liquid,
pardon
me.
and
inevitably,
when
anything
was
carried
other
than
gasoline,
they
were
in
violation
of
the
weight
laws
of
pennsylvania.
they
were
completely
permissible
within
the
rate
set
--
within
the
weight
set
by
the
other
states.
mr.
leonard
sarner
surely.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
yes.
i
mean
--
but
i,
of
course,
i
wouldn't
present
it
in
the
way
that
your
honor
did.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
say
this.
now,
i
think
it's--
i
think
it's
--
it's
not
to
be
cast
in
that
way.
mr.
leonard
sarner
all
right.
yes.
(voice
overlap)
i
--
i
think
that
when
a
state
proscribes
certain
activity
and
the
weight
laws
say
that
we
must
--
and
the
industry
unquestionably
reputable
important
industry
determines
that
it
cannot
economically
survive
under
this
pros
--
proscription
of
the
state.
and
therefore,
it
incurs
expenses
which
are
unavoidable
under
its
determination
that
it
either
has
to
remain
in
business
or
go
out
of
business
then
for
revenue
purposes,
the
government,
the
tax
laws
are
not
to
pay
--
double
the
punish.
we
paid
to
find
once
the
--
justice
burton
had
asked
mr.
harwood,
“well,
aren't
you
getting
the
--
the
government
to
pay
part
of
your
--
your
fine?”
well,
in
a
sense,
yes,
but
the
government
in
the
sense
pays
part
of
every
expense.
i
mean
that
government
pays
part
of
the
salary
expense,
of
the
--
of
oil
expense,
we
can
obtain
permits
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
leonard
sarner
it
might,
it
very
well
might.
and
if
congress
so
determines,
i
think
then
possibly,
we
would
have
a
different
question
that
is
here
in
congress.
mr.
leonard
sarner
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yeah,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
i
--
i
--
your
honor,
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
leonard
sarner
if
you
used
the
--
the
concept
of
ordinary
and
necessary.
mr.
leonard
sarner
if
you
used
that
concept
and
if
you
find
in
this
particular
industry,
in
this
trade,
in
this
business,
it
is
ordinary
and
necessary
to
make
these
expenditures
which
are
in
violation
of
law
or
to
commit
certain
activities
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
--
for
which
you
are
fine
then
it
makes
no
difference
whether
this
is
a
legitimate,
recognized
industry
or
an
illegitimate
one
or
one
which
is
--
which
is
prohibited.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
that
--
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no,
it
does
not
follow.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
i
--
i
will
(voice
overlap).
but
of
course
we
--
we
would
take
the
position.
but
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
that's
not
so,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
it
is,
but
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
not
--
not
on
the
use.
you
must
remember
in
this
particular
case,
pennsylvania,
of
all
the
states
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
--
had
--
had
a
4500
pound
limitation,
every
other
state
had
60,
pennsylvania
now
has
60.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
sarner
right.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
i
wouldn't
call
--
i
mean
if
--
if
what
you
say
is
so,
i
would
not
at
all
call
it
an
inconsequential
thing
but
i
would
say
i
don't
see
where
the
revenue
code
has
any
play
in
this.
mr.
leonard
sarner
that's
right.
i
mean
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
and
i
think
your
honor,
that
--
that
if
the
facts
as
you've
exist,
as
you've
indicated,
you
will
not
find
the
trucking
industry
doing
commonly,
normally
and
ordinarily
the
things
which
you've
mentioned.
mr.
leonard
sarner
they
don't
do
that.
mr.
leonard
sarner
absolutely.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
there's
no
question
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
but
there's
no
question.
utah
and
pennsylvania,
when
we
had
any
interstate
shipment,
we
were
insofar,
we
couldn't
carry
the
4500
pounds
and
operate
at
all
in
ohio,
in
delaware,
in
new
jersey
and
make
and
--
and
be
in
business
for
-
-for
a
week.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
they
all
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
they
all
--
well,
we
don't
--
we
didn't
run
into
any
of
that
problem
here.
our
problem
here
was
that
all
of
the
states
had
an
approximate
$60,000
weight
limit
except
pennsylvania.
mr.
leonard
sarner
well
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
the
tax
court
so
found
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
and
the
testimony
so
indicated,
you
see,
we
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
a
common
wide,
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
industry
in
--
in
fact,
we
represented
the
industry.
we
actually
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
tank
truck
in
the
sense
that
we
are
not
certificated
carriers.
we
lease
our
equipment,
there
were
three
big
carriers
in
this
industry,
in
the
--
in
the
eastern
area
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
the
--
85%
of
the
business
is
carried
by
three
carriers.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
no
evidence
of
the
other.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes,
1955.
mr.
leonard
sarner
from
1943.
mr.
leonard
sarner
to
1955.
mr.
leonard
sarner
every
--
that's
all
in
the
record.
every
two
years,
a
new
weight
bill
was
introduced
and
defeated
for
purposes
of
which
we
--
we
think
we
know
but
eventually
it
was
passed.
mr.
leonard
sarner
oh
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
positively.
i
mean
we're
not
--
we're
not
in
anyway
attacking
the
wisdom
of
--
of
the
pennsylvania
weight
legislation.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no.
mr.
leonard
sarner
we
don't
pay
it.
mr.
leonard
sarner
no?
mr.
leonard
sarner
maybe
--
maybe
they
do,
yes
--
maybe
they
do.
well,
i
mean
i
--
i
think
it
can
be
answered.
i
mean,
i
think,
you
take
the
concept
of
what
is
ordinary
and
what
is
necessary.
and
if
--
and
if
you
find
that
it
is
ordinary
in
--
in
this
particular
industry
to
speed,
then
i
think
--
then
i
think
that
the
--
that
so
far
as
tax
purposes
are
concerned,
this
is
deductible.
but
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
well,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
say
in
--
insofar
as
we
have
no
limitation
set
forth
in
the
statute.
no
regulation,
whatsoever,
which
covers
this
matter
then
we're
bound
by
the
phrase
what
is
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenditure
and
its
all
common,
usual,
frequent,
necessary
to
this
industry.
your
honors,
i
like
to
--
since
i
just
got
a
few
minutes
left,
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
or
two
things,
the
concept
of
frustration
has
no
bounds,
whatsoever,
because
if
you
say
that
to
allow
the
deduction
of
this
fine
would
frustrate
interfere
with
the
policy
set
forth
by
the
weight
limitation
laws
then
even
more
so,
does
it
interfere
with
those
policies
to
allow
the
deduction
of
the
drivers'
salaries,
to
allow
the
depreciation
on
the
vehicles,
to
allow
us
to
deduct
any
expenditure
involved
in
the
operation
of
this
business.
and
that
of
course
comes
to
the
position
that
former
attorney
brown
now
had
taken
when
he
addressed
the
american
bar
association
to
a
position
which
the
government
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
reaching
to
take
but
would
say
refraining
from
in
this
brief.
and
that
is
that
whenever
you
have
an
illegal
business
or
whenever
you
have
say
a
transgression
of
a
legal
business,
you
attack
the
entire
gross
income,
not
the
net
income
because
to
allow
any
expenditure,
any
expenditure
as
a
deduction
for
tax
purposes,
allows
this
activity
to
continue
in
existence.
and
therefore,
if
you
want
to
use
the
revenue
law
to
enforce
these
state
laws,
then
disallow
all
expenses
whatsoever.
and
i
think,
your
honors,
it's
very
important
to
note
that
not
only
is
there
nothing
in
the
code
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
at
all
to
cover
this
matter.
but
the
regulations
do
have
a
penalty
provision.
at
the
time
this
doctrine
was
being
evolved
in
the
courts
about
frustrating
public
policy,
the
--
one
of
the
circuits
decided
the
case
that
penalty
payments
paid
for
violation
of
federal
income
tax
laws
such
as
the
fraud
payment,
or
the
negligence
or
the
delinquency
payments
were
not
deductible
as
necessary
in
ordinary
business
expense
though
they
thought
there
might
be
some
doubt
about
it.
and
thereafter,
the
treasury
incorporated
in
the
regulations,
this
penalty
provision
and
it
is
limited
to
penalty
payments
made
in
connection
with
violation
of
the
federal
income
tax
law.
now,
of
course
that's
a
totally
different
problem.
we
don't
deny
that
congress
on
one
hand
can
make
a
determination
and
therefore,
in
order
to
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
its
own
laws,
can
deny
income
tax
recognition
to
a
lot
of
things.
but
that's
not
our
problem,
our
problem
is,
are
we
to
take
an
absolute
determination
by
the
state.
pennsylvania
has
a
blue
law
which
is
now
sought
to
be
enforced.
and
the
commissioner
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
doyle
case
pointed
this
out,
insofar
as
of
--
some
of
pennsylvania
dealers
may
now
sell
on
sundays,
in
violation
of
the
pennsylvania
law
which
has
been
on
the
books
for
200
years
and
which
has
been
always
violated,
are
they
not
to
be
allowed
their
normal,
usual,
common
expenses
of
operating
on
a
sunday
whereas
in
other
states,
this
activity
is
permitted
and
there's
no
question
and
it
--
mr.
leonard
sarner
no
--
no.
and
--
and
the
government
maybe
not
in
this
particular
case,
but
in
the
arguments
before
the
--
in
the
argument
before
the
lower
courts
and
a
variety
of
cases,
sees
no
difference,
whatsoever,
in
that
situation.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
yes.
mr.
leonard
sarner
there
--
there
is
no
basis
for
that,
your
honor.
and
that
at
the
--
at
some
fines
were
allowed
insofar
as
the
penalty
payment
is
made
to
the
government
for
an
innocent
violation,
they
allow
the
deduction
to
be
taken.
the
government
in
those
cases
has
lost
but
has
argued
that
there
is
no
difference,
whatsoever,
between
the
cost
of
good
soul
to
allow
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
the
illegal
payment
enforced
to
goods
or
to
deduct
illegal
penalty
payments.
they'd
argued.
they
lost
those
cases
and
i
think
that
you
will
see,
your
honors,
that
insofar
as
this
matter
has
evolved
in
the
courts,
there
is
no
pattern
whatsoever.
and
hence,
what
we
must
do
is
to
limit
ourselves
to
the
concept
of
ordinary
and
necessary
within
the
framework
of
the
decision
of
the
court.
