what
about
the
preceding
case
where
you
haven't
got
that
on
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
that
point,
are
the
findings
of
the
court
different
--
in
the
different
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
circuits
are
there
on
each
side
of
this
conflict?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
judges
case
to
which
reference
has
been
made
was
not
decided
(inaudible).
as
i
recall
it,
the
basis
of
it
was
--
that
it
was
--
nobody
could
suppose
under
any
circumstances
that
a
man
would
put
his
practice
of
law
and
accepted
a
job
as
judge
with
the
agreement
to
run
--
run
for
it,
that
it
was
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
for
him
to
pay
the
assessment
which
was
laid
on
him
in
order
to
get
the
privilege
of
running.
and
who
did
hold
there,
they
didn't
follow
the
tax
court
which
held
that
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
in
this
country
that
any
judge
had
ever
held
that
position
who's
at
all
influenced
by
the
desire
to
get
the
salary.
