mr.
john
j.
o'connor
may
it
please
the
court.
i
apologize
for
a
bad
throat.
i've
been
in
bed
for
four
days,
but
i'd
like
to
defer
answering
the
distinguished
counsel
for
the
petitioners
here.
i
think
they
have
been
mistaken
in
all
their
answers
to
the
court's
inquiries,
until
i
make
an
attempt
to
lay
before
this
court
a
picture
of
just
what
this
system
is.
now
the
main
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
a
common
carrier
in
the
ocean
trade,
obligated
to
take
every
shippers'
cargo
within
their
capacity,
can
and
in
concert
charge
two
shippers
two
different
rates
for
identical
transportation,
being
the
same
in
every
respect
as
to
the
type
of
cargo,
the
quantity
of
cargo,
the
distance
involved,
loaded
at
the
same
port,
discharged
at
the
same
port,
handled
under
these
very
same
conditions,
placed
even
on
the
same
ship,
whether
or
not
they
can
do
that
under
the
1916
act
or
under
any
provision
of
law.
of
course
they
couldn't
do
it
in
common
law.
that
was
definitely
held
in
thompson
against
kaiser
which
just
before
the
1916
act
held
that
the
system
was
illegal
in
ocean
transportation.
now,
the
only
consideration
for
the
lower
rate
is
the
agreement
by
the
shipper
to
give
his
exclusive
patronage
to
the
conference
lines
and
to
boycott
any
other
line,
an
independent
line
such
as
isbrandtsen
which
is
the
only
independent
line
in
this
trade.
there
is
no
question
of
volume
involved,
section
14(a)
handles
that
and
would
restrict
any
dealing
with
that.
there
is
no
question
of
frequency
of
service.
we
say
and
have
said
from
the
beginning
for
ten
years,
that
it
just
cannot
be
done,
whether
it
can
be
accomplished
by
precise
legislation
which
has
already
been
drafted
we
understand,
is
a
serious
question
which
we
shall
met
when
we
come
to
that
bridge.
to
start
out
it's
a
price
fixing
arrangement
among
these
carriers,
and
in
addition
to
that
you
have
the
tie-in
arrangement,
both
of
which
are
fundamentally
unlawful
under
our
laws.
now
it
maybe
the
section
15
permits
these
companies
to
get
together
and
fix
prices,
uniform
rates,
that
was
the
purpose
of
it,
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
bulwinkle
act
for
railroads
to
get
together,
but
there
is
no
provision
that
they
could
fix
two
rates
for
the
same
transportation
services
and
in
no
other
form
of
transportation
is
that
even
attempted
to
fix
tour
rates
under
an
exclusive
patronage
contract.
now
it
says
in
section
15
permitting
this
extraordinary
privilege,
and
this
limited
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws,
that
they
may
even
destroy
competition,
but
it
is
not
even
claimed
by
the
board
that
they
can
do
more
than
destroy
competition
among
themselves,
and
not
destroy
any
outside
competition.
and
because
of
these
theories
and
this
testimony
before
the
alexander
committee,
not
a
report
just
testimony,
stands
for
anything,
it
shows
repeatedly
if
there
was
attempt
of
congress
to
spray
limits
that
it
was
the
intent
to
preserve
independent
competition;
that,
that
runs
through
it
and
the
other
theme
running
through
the
whole
historical
background
which
they
call
is
there
shall
be
no
retaliation.
the
word
retaliation
is
constantly
used.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
well,
they
found
many
instances
of
retaliation
against
shippers
who
would
not
patronize
or
exclusively
sign
up
even
with
one
carrier
or
with
a
group
of
carriers.
they
were
not
given
service,
they
were
charged
higher
rates,
they
were
not
given
service
to
particular
ports,
they
couldn't
pick
the
ports
to
which
they
were
to
ship
their
goods
and
so
forth
and
i
don't
believe
retaliation
here
is
used
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
like
for
like
as
the
board
would
have
it,
and
the
court
below
of
course
went
into
that
and
said
retaliation
here
is
doing
something
to
a
shipper
because
he
will
not
surrender
his
fundamental
right
to
do
a
certain
thing.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
oh
no
i
think
there
is
a
variety
of
meanings
for
it.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
meaning
is
applicable
here,
except
by
reading
the
statute
and
seeing
right
from
the
statute
itself
there
is
no
ambiguity.
reading
the
statute
and
seeing
what
the
aim
was
to
protect
shippers
and
you
go
through
section
16,
17
you
will
find
other
provisions
against
discrimination,
against
preferences
and
so
forth.
now
the
court
below
found
that
the
board
had
no
authority
to
approve
such
a
system
and
even
in
the
swayne
&
hoyt
case
which
has
been
cited
to
you
as
some
authority
which
we
dispute
for
a
decision
in
this
case,
that
court
said
that
this
system
which
is
known
not
as
a
contract
rate
system
as
counsel
as
said,
it's
generally
known
as
the
exclusive
patronage
contract,
non-contract,
dual
rate
system.
it
was
created
in
1923
in
this
country,
seven
years
after
1916
act
and
it
was
not
enforced
in
any
extent
by
conferences
till
the
30's.
now,
it's
just
a
substitute
as
the
supreme
court
said
in
swayne
&
hoyt,
for
the
outlaw
deferred
rebate
system.
now
gentlemen
these
conferences
are
nothing
less
than
cartels
and
the
(inaudible)
cartels,
they
are
known
as
cartels.
the
latest
book
on
this
subject
is
by
professor
marx
of
gartner
international
shipping
cartels,
in
england
they
are
know
as
shipping
rings.
now
the
only
system
ever
used
before
1923
other
than
the
referred
rebate
system
which
we
have
outlawed
made
a
crime,
was
the
contract
system,
and
you
notice
that's
all
counsel
said,
the
contract
system,
a
contract
of
shipment,
whereby
the
shipper
agreed
to
send
his
goods
exclusively
by
the
particular
line
of
the
conference
lines
in
consideration
of
a
certain
rate.
now
one
of
the
justices,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
contract
used
by
this
conference,
whether
or
not
there
was
any
provision
as
to
two
rates
whether
there
is
or
not.
on
page
203
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
find
that
the
contract
which
the
conference
submits
to
the
shippers
refers
to
--
gives
them
the
contract
rate,
and
of
course
that
implies
that
if
they
don't
sign
up
they'll
pay
the
non-contract
rate,
which
of
course
is
in
this
instance
substantially
10%
higher
and
some
shippers
said
well
it'd
put
out
of
business,
that's
our
margin
of
profit.
some
rates
run
to
$200
a
ton
that
will
be
$20.
now
this
conference
going
the
other
way,
outbound,
which
is
the
profitable
trade,
that's
why
the
homeward
bound
ships,
the
same
ships
are
overtonnaged.
the
conference
going
the
other
way
of
the
same
line
substantially
to
file
these
to
conference,
they
only
charged
a
flat
rate
of
$4
a
ton.
we
claim
not
only
is
this
system
unlawful
under
section
14
of
the
16
act,
we
claim
is
unlawful
under
section
15,
16
and
17
that's
unlawful
under
the
anti-trust
laws
which
still
persists
because
of
the
limited
immunity
in
section
15
and
this
act
as
unlawful
under
the
constitution.
the
court
below
of
course
having
arrived
at
this
illegality
under
section
14(3)
saw
no
occasion
to
discuss
these
other
questions.
in
all
there
were
five
questions
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
considered,
but
we
believe
here
that
there
should
be
due
respect
of
the
court
an
earnest
consideration
of
these
other
questions
which
we
submitted
to
the
court
below
and
especially
in
any
case
that
there
is
an
attempt
to
revive
this
system,
in
1936
there
was
an
attempt
to
revise
this
outlawed
dual
rate
system
and
in
1938
there
was
an
attempt
to
legalize
it,
to
revive
the
deferred
rebate
system
and
in
1938
there
was
an
attempt
to
legalize
the
dual
rate
system,
this
is
exclusive
package
system.
now
all
these
petitioners
or
appellants
have
to
stand
upon,
and
had
to
stand
upon
for
10
years
during
which
we
have
been
in
this
ligation
and
two
implications
admittedly
they
have
nothing.
they
claim
that
this
system
was
impliedly
approved
by
the
alexander
committee
because
it
was
not
condemned
and
i
practically
quote
their
language
and
they
say
it
was
also
impliedly
approved
by
at
least
two
decisions
of
this
court
because
it
was
not
specifically
condemned.
and
of
course
they
will
not
argue
that
it
was
ever
an
issue
before
this
court
or
before
any
other
court
because
counsel
for
board
and
the
board
chairman
have
admitted
that
issue
has
never
been
before
this
court
and
the
court
says
this
as
they
cited
this
quote,
well
merely
cases.
some
of
you
distinguished
justices
will
recall
upon
these
conference
case
in
1952
was
merely
a
case
of
primary
jurisdiction.
likewise
the
cunard
referred
to
here
in
284
us
was
merely
a
case
of
primary
jurisdiction
both
sent
back
to
the
board
for
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy.
and
the
swayne
&
hoyt
case
so
called
which
had
some
dictum,
admittedly
dictum
by
the
chairman
of
the
board,
did
not
have
the
issue
as
to
the
legality
of
this
system
before
it,
merely
whether
or
not
it
violated
section
16
of
the
act
as
to
unjust
discrimination
between
shippers
and
the
court
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
maritime
authority
that
it
did
violate.
now
that's
all,
those
are
the
weak
reasons
to
which
they
cling
throughout
these
cases.
for
10
years
we've
struggled.
say
–
we
use
grants
in
departments
of
justice
and
agriculture
have
struggled
to
get
a
definitive
determination
of
this
issue
and
we
have
been
brought
that
every
move
by
a
claim
of
primary
jurisdiction
would
been
brought
by
the
conferences
and
we
have
been
brought
principally
by
the
maritime
board
which
in
each
case
has
sat
as
the
judge
in
–
at
least
i
(inaudible)
as
it
were.
but
it's
been
the
most
active
appellant
mover
for
certiorari
to
stop
any
upsetting
of
this
cartel.
well
as
to
the
alexander
committee
report
as
important,
on
the
first
page
of
it,
board
counsel
and
department
of
justice
admit
the
submission
of
these
extracts
carries
with
it
no
implication
as
to
its
relevance
or
significance
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
shipping
act.
outside
of
that
it
can
be
taken
for
whatever
word
can
be
found
in
it,
whenever
company
has
any
legislation
it
was
a
just
a
summary
by
a
paid
employee
of
certain
testimony
would
be
forced.
the
committee
back
in
1912
the
members
of
which
did
not
survive
to
enact
the
law
in
1916
and
when
counsel
for
the
board
says
it
was
a
summary
by
the
committee,
he
innocently
mistakes
the
summary
by
a
higher
employee
of
the
committee.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
they
use
the
written,
but
they,
they
are
written,
they
accomplish
some
legislation.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
i
am
afraid
that
no
member
of
the
committee,
the
changes
were
so
great
and
the
time
had
lapsed
nearly
four
years,
no
member
of
the
committee
had
much
to
do
with
this
writing
because
they
had
a
professor,
professor
of
transportation
mr.
huebner
from
university
of
pennsylvania
and
he
sat
down
and
he
attempted
to
summarize
and
you
have
been
read
to
use
something
about
--
the
deferred
rebate
system
of
course
was
a
hardship
but
the
contract
system
he
didn't
say
that
the
committee
found,
he
said
it
was
argued.
now
in
five
places
in
the
board's
brief
they
drop
out
the
words,
‘it
was
argued'
and
it
was
left
to
this
court,
language
quoted
as
if
the
committee
itself
said
or
found
that
the
ordinary
contract
system,
and
notice
the
language
‘the
ordinary
contract
system.'
now
you've
had
section
14
(3)
written.
now
the
court
below
in
these
two
separate
opinions
found
that
to
retaliate
against
a
shipper
because
he
would
not
sign
the
exclusive
patronage
contract
was
the
one
of
the
methods
of
retaliation
referred
to
in
the
act.
in
addition
of
course
if
after
citing
you
patronize
a
non-conference
independent
operator,
he
would
be
fined
50%
of
the
freight
which
he
would
have
paid
to
conference.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
steamship
lines
make
50%
of
freights
they
take
in.
now
an
important
point
in
here,
over
the
years
it's
been
said
well,
all
discrimination
must
be
unjust,
unreasonable,
and
as
we
point
out
the
history
of
this
legislation
puts
the
words
‘unjust'
in
every
section
except
section
14
(3)
and
the
history
of
the
legislation
of
various
views
that
went
through
the
process
and
is
finally
adopted,
it
is
clear
beyond
question
that
those
qualifying
words
were
deliberately
left
out
of
section
14
(3)
because
of
the
intent
desire
of
congress
to
prevent
retaliation
of
any
kind.
now
section
15
would
be
reason
to
disapprove
the
section,
the
system,
section
16
which
forbids,
which
forbids
giving
any
undue
or
unreasonably
preference
or
advantage
to
any
particular
person,
section
17
all
common
carrier
shall
charge
any
rate,
was
unjustly
discriminatory
between
shippers.
now
let
me
address
myself
to
the
others,
substantially
which
we
couldn't
even
get
the
board
to
pay
any
attention
to
us
about.
we
claim
that
this
system
is
fundamentally
illegal
because
it
informs
the
signing
of
the
shippers'
contract
between
the
conference
or
the
conference
on
behalf
of
its
lines
and
a
shipper.
and
such
a
contract
is
not
granted
any
immunity
under
section
15
of
the
act
because
a
shipper
is
not
a
person
subject
to
the
act.
only
person
subject
to
the
act
carriers
and
forwarders
can
enter
into
a
combination
or
conference.
now
when
the
--
the
means
of
carrying
out
this
system
is
this
contract,
printed
at
page
203
of
the
joint
appendix,
between
the
conference
and
the
shipper
whereby
he
agrees
to
patronize
those
lines
exclusively,
the
other
side
brushes
it
aside.
they
don't
immediately
–
even
their
brief
says
oh
that's
just
a
contract
carries
out
--
enter
in
to
a
contract
with
shippers,
sure
they
do.
on
the
ordinary
system
they
on
every
shipping
transaction,
they
enter
into
a
bill
of
lading.
and
they
do
here
where
they
use
this
exclusive
patronage
system
but
in
between
that
and
the
agreement
of
a
set
up
of
a
system,
there
is
a
contract
entered
into
between
the
conference
and
the
shipper.
and
that
contract
is
never
filed
for
approval
and
has
never
been
approved
by
the
board.
likewise
we
contend
and
is
a
very
serious
question
that
if
by
any
possibility
such
a
power
was
lodged
in
the
board,
as
placed
by
the
proponents
of
the
system,
it
would
be
an
undue
delegation
of
power
to
the
board
without
the
fixing
of
proper
standards.
and
further
than
that
and
worst,
it
would
be
--
it
is
further
delegated
by
the
board
to
the
conferences
under
what
they
call
self
regulation
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
conferences
shall
be
put
a
non
conference
independent
carrier
out
of
business.
let
me
quote
to
you
what
the
board
itself
and
the
chairman
think
about
this
system.
it's
only
recently
they
claim
it,
if
this
isn't
intended
we
would
stand
for
monopoly.
in
the
first
case
we
brought
back
in
1948
to
test
this
question,
isbrandtsen
case
before
a
statutory
court
in
new
york
which
ultimately
came
here
in
342
us
1952,
board
counsel
made
this
statement
which
judge
frank
quoted.
“that
the
purpose
of
the
dual
rate
provisions
was
if
possible
to
bring
about
a
condition
in
which
an
independent
carrier,”
such
as
isbrandtsen,
“could
be
compelled
through
loss
or
threatened
loss
of
profits
either
to
join
the
conference
or
go
out
of
business.
if
a
contract
system
is
wholly
effective,
it
will
result
in
a
complete
monopoly.
necessarily,
in
these
circumstances,
there
would
be
no
service
by
independent
operators.”
isbrandtsen
is
the
american
flag
line
competing
against
12
foreign
liners,
eight
of
them
japanese
lines
and
the
board's
chairman
said
in
a
decision,
coming
down
in
just
about
the
same
time,
a
decision
in
this
particular
conference
case,
“in
considering
an
application
to
institute
a
dual
rate
system
in
any
trade,
we
must
recognize
the
immediate
purpose
of
the
system
simply
stated
to
be
the
elimination
of
non
conference
competition
as
such.”
now,
well,
that's
what
congress
intended
and
they
wasted
lot
of
language
in
the
16
act
trying
to
protect
shippers
and
trying
to
protect
independent
operators.
now
over
the
years
the
board
and
the
champions
of
this
cartel
system
have
had
two
alibis
as
it
were,
have
been
expressed
almost
ad
nauseam.
some
of
us
simple
people
claim
that
it
even
in
(inaudible)
intelligence.
they
say
first
the
shipper
who
refuses
to
sign
up
can
do
so
if
he
wants
to,
can't
he,
can't
he
sign
up,
not
so
preventive.
well,
of
course
the
board
itself
in
the
early
30s
when
they
used
reason
(inaudible)
ridicule
that
silly
alibi.
and
the
second
is
that
isbrandtsen
is
an
independent,
he
could
joint
the
conference,
can't
he,
not
to
prevent
them,
but
of
course
(inaudible)
imagine
that
the
victim
of
alibaba
and
his
40
thieves
might
have
had
that
opportunity
to
join
up
to
become
that
41st.
but
surely
in
this
land
of
ours,
there's
no
such
as
this
compulsory
joining
to
save
one's
skin,
but
that
wouldn't
even
help
a
large
segment
of
this
trade,
which
is
another
serious
consideration
here
because
clamp
operators,
bulk
carriers,
comprise
a
tremendous
portion
of
our
foreign
commerce.
they
compete
with
these
conference
lines
and
the
conference
lines
always
cite
their
competition
when
they
come
in
and
ask
for
permission
to
use
a
dual
rate
system.
and
under
the
act,
clamp
operators
are
not
permitted
to
join
a
conference
because
only
common
carriers
could
join.
now
as
i
say
for
ten
years
we
have
struggled
against
this
matter
down
to
a
position
of
a
definitive
determination
on
the
fundamental
issue
involved.
so
that's
why
we
are
here
again
today.
we
were
here
five
years
ago,
and
the
isbrandtsen
case
went
off
on
another
tangent,
we
won
it
but
didn't
go
to
the
fundamental
legal
question.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
has
not
been
introduced.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
i
understand
it
is
ready
to
be
introduced
in
the
event
of
certain
decision
by
certain
tribunal.
but
we
ask
this
court
to
give,
fortuitous
to
say
serious
consideration,
give
considerations
to
all
of
the
questions
involved
here
because
they
are
fundamental,
every
exporter,
importer
and
consumer
of
the
united
states.
i
remind
you,
let
me
--
one
word
as
to
the
indispensability
of
this,
only
half
the
conference
is
used.
another
point
they
say
the
board
says
we
only
given
permit
the
system
to
be
used
to
meet
independent
competition.
and
in
the
62
conferences
which
use
the
system,
in
only
three
of
them
is
there
any
independent
competition.
so
they
sign
up
all
shippers
but
the
real
purpose
of
the
system
is
to
deter
any
independent
entering
a
trade
that's
what
that
board
calls
potential
competition.
so
even
on
the
board's
own
criteria
of
preventing
monopoly,
stability
of
rates,
there
was
no
instability
of
rates
here
or
to
meet
independent
competition,
there
is
no
situation
in
this
case
and
even
the
chairman
said
to
prescribe
that
--
to
guess
that
isbrandtsen
would
get
10%
in
this
trade
if
this
system
was
set
up
was
a
pure
hazard,
just
looking
into
a
crystal
ball,
no
one
had
the
right
to
make
such
an
estimation
in
any
trade.
for
those
reasons
we
respectfully
submit
it
to
you.
we
have
gone
through
the
torture
ten
years
and
even
a
victory
at
the
end
of
that
time
does
not
entirely
relieve
the
torture.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
in
this
conference
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
i
think
the
record
shows,
the
records
has
attached
to
it,
certain
tables
showing
the
rates
of
this
conference,
of
course
in
the
various
conferences
of
the
125
conferences
authorized,
only
62
used
the
system,
the
others
will
(inaudible)
and
that
the
conferences
authorized
the
spread
of
differential
between
the
contract
and
non-
contract
rates,
varies
from
$4
a
ton
to
$9
a
ton,
where
they
used
the
flat
dollars.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
well
i
don't
think
it's
actually
in
the
record
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
well
i
don't
think
its
disputed,
it's
in
the
record
of
the
maritime
board,
and
the
only
deferential
here
is
9.5%
and
was
so
low
and
not
20
or
30,
because
the
japanese
authorities
had
adopted
that
limit,
japanese
authorities
did
not
approve
this
system,
but
they
said
if
you
do
use
any
system
you
can't
use
over
9.5%,
that's
the
only
reason
for
this,
minimum,
this
is
the
very
minimum
they
charge,
they
charge
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor
yes
it
does.
thank
you.
