mr.
warner
w.
gardner
may
it
please
the
court?
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
set
aside
orders
of
the
federal
maritime
board,
approving
a
so
called
contract
rate
system
proposed
by
the
japan-atlantic
and
gulf
freight
conference.
a
contract
rate
system
is
broadly
an
agreement
by
the
member
of
lines
of
the
steamship
conference
that
they
will
contract
with
the
shippers
in
the
trade,
so
that
in
return
for
a
promise
to
ship
only
by
member
lines,
the
shippers
will
be
charged
this
smaller
freight,
here
nine-and-one-half
percent
less
than
the
rate
charged
non-signatories.
by
pre-hearing
stipulation
of
that
order,
the
review
of
the
boards
orders
confined
to
the
fact
as
found
by
the
board.
the
trade
involved
is
the
trade
from
japan
okinawa
and
korea
to
the
united
states
atlantic
and
gulf
ports.
the
important
movement
is
from
japan
to
the
north
atlantic
ports.
the
trade
is
overtonnage
that
is
too
little
cargo
moves
for
the
330
odd
sailings
made
each
year
and
all
vessels
carry
substantial
empty
space
on
their
inbound
journey
to
the
united
states.
the
trade
is
served
by
18
steamship
lines
operating
a
regular
or
berth
liner
service.
all
except
one,
the
respondent
isbrandtsen
here,
are
members
of
the
conference.
the
stated
purpose
of
the
conference
is
to
establish
and
maintain
agreed
rate.
any
line
regularly
operating
in
the
trade
may
become
a
member
of
the
conference.
until
march
of
1953,
the
conference
operated
to
prevent
rate
wars,
to
preserve
rate
stability
and
regularity
of
the
service.
in
1949,
isbrandtsen
entered
the
east
bound
trade
from
japan
to
the
united
states
atlantic
ports.
isbrandtsen,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
refuses
to
join
conferences
and
quotes
rates
which
are
ordinarily
10%
below
the
conference
rates,
whatever
those
rates
maybe.
so
long
as
it
is
thus
freed
of
rate
competition
from
conference
members
who
adhere
to
their
agreed
rate,
isbrandtsen
can,
by
its
10%
differential,
attract
substantial
cargos
away
from
its
competitors
and
to
its
own
vessels.
in
each
year,
from
1950
through
1952,
isbrandtsen
on
the
average
loaded
more
than
three
times
the
amount
of
cargo
that
was
loaded
by
the
average
conference
line
vessel.
the
conference
lines
considered
that
they
must
take
protective
steps.
the
conference
accordingly,
in
december
1952,
filed
with
the
board,
a
proposal
to
inaugurate
a
contract
rate
system
upon
the
approval
of
the
board.
after
notice,
the
respondents
here
entered
protest.
the
board
sent
the
case
for
a
hearing,
but
refused
to
suspend
the
contract
rate
system
pending
that
hearing.
the
court
below
first
restrained
and
then
enjoined
that
interlocutory
order
holding
that
the
contract
rate
system
could
not
be
inaugurated
even
provisionally
without
full
approval
of
the
board.
the
conference,
in
march
1953
with
its
contract
rate
system
restrained,
voted
to
open
rates
on
10
major
commodities,
that
is
to
leave
each
line
free
to
make
the
isbrandtsen
competition
by
quoting
its
own
rates.
within
a
short
time
the
rates
on
all
significant
commodities
in
the
trade
had
been
opened.
the
rates
fell
to
about
one-third
of
the
march
levels.
on
a
number
of
commodities,
the
rates
were
well
below
the
costs
merely
of
loading
and
discharging
the
cargo.
there
was,
in
short,
a
full
fledged
rate
war.
isbrandtsen
dropped
out
of
the
rate
war
in
may
of
1953
and
has
since
carried
little
cargo
in
the
trade.
this
is
not
a
shipper's
paradise.
while
the
rates
are
low
they
are
fluctuating
and
unpredictable.
there
is
no
assurance
that
competing
sellers
will
not
have
different
freight
rates.
forward
buying
becomes
a
gamble.

orders
were
postponed.
in
fact,
the
shippers,
while
believing
that
the
march
1953
rates
were
too
high,
have
requested
the
conference
to
close
its
rates
and
it
testified
in
the
hearing
before
the
board
that
they
considered
the
nine-and-a-half
percent
differential
to
be
reasonable.
the
contract
which
the
conference
lines
have
here
agreed
to
be
submitted
to
the
shippers
is
to
be
read
against
the
tariff
published
by
the
conference
which
contains
two
rates,
the
contract
rate
and
the
non-contract
rate,
with
the
rate
for
contract
shippers'
nine-and-a-half
percent
below
the
non-contract
rate.
the
actual
contract
agreed
to
be
submitted
to
the
shippers
has
these
salient
provisions.
the
shipper
agrees
to
forward
all
shipments
by
conference
line
vessels.
the
carriers
agree
to
maintain
a
service
adequate
to
meet
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
trade
and
to
carry
the
goods
so
far
as
regular
vessels
are
available
and
they
note
that
they
will
always
be
available
in
this
overtonnage

year,
but
should
they
not
be,
the
shipper
is
released
from
his
obligation
to
use
only
conference
line
vessels
and
the
conference
liability
maybe
put
to
arbitration.

the
board
held

hearings
and
filed
a
comprehensive
report
covering

pages
of
the
printed
record

starting
at

19.
its
salient
findings
were
these.
the
contract
rate
system
is
necessary
for
the
survival
of
the
conference
and
necessary
to
preserve
rate
stability
and
regular
service
in
this
trade.
the
nine-and-a-half
percent
differential,
the
board
found
to
be
reasonable.
it
is
generally
accepted
by
the
shippers
to
protect
the
conference
lines
against
undue
diversion
of
traffic
to
isbrandtsen
and
yet
will
not
drive
isbrandtsen
from
the
trade.
in
fact
isbrandtsen
is
about
7%
of
the
sailings
in
1953,
who
probably,
the
board
found,
carried
10%
or
somewhat
more
of
the
traffic.
their
well
and
short
be
that
many
shippers
who
will
find
it
advantageous
to
use
isbrandtsen
charging
rates
10%
below
the
contract
rate
and
when
necessary
to
supplement
isbrandtsen's
fortnightly
service
to
pay
the
full
contract
rate,
to
conference
line.
possibly
a
arithmetical
example
will
make
that
a
little
clear.
if
you
assume
a
contract
--
a
non-contract
rate
of
$33
a
ton,
the
conference
proposes
to
offer
to
the
shippers
a
rate
of
$30
a
ton
if
they
agree
to
patronize
the
conference
line.
isbrandtsen
on
past
performance
and
on
the
basis
of
the
announcement
made
to
the
trade
will
reduce
the
$30
rate
by
another
10%
making
it
$27.
accordingly,
for
a
number
of
shippers
it'll
be
advantageous
to
pay
$27
to
isbrandtsen,
when
they
can
use
the
isbrandtsen
service
and
$33
to
the
conference
when
they're
forced
to
use
conference
vessels.
other
shippers,
and
undoubtedly
the
majority
will
find
it
advantageous
to
pay
the
straight
$30
to
the
conference
who
will
accordingly
sign
the
contracts
proposed
by
the
conference.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
review,
held
that
the
board
had
no
power
to
approve
a
contract
rate
system.
its
reasons
were
given
in
two
opinions,
in
each
of
which
all
three
judges
joined.
judge
fay
said
that
the
contract
rate
system
was
condemned
by
section
14
third
of
the
shipping
act
of
1916,
as
a
retaliatory
and
discriminating
method
resorted
to
because
the
shipper
had
patronized
another
carrier.
since
we
consider
it
was
absolutely
banned,
the
opinion
continues
that
it's
immaterial
that
the
contract
rate
system
maybe
desirable,
or
that
it
maybe
reasonable
or
that
it's
objectives
maybe
consistent
with
the
statute.
judge
washington
added
that
the
exclusive
patronage
contracts
which
were
known
to
and
impliedly
proved
by
the
congress
when
the
shipping
act
was
enacted,
for
what
he
considered
to
be
bona
fide
requirement
contracts,
quite
different
from
those
at
the
bar.
we
must
start
with
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
of
1916,
printed
at
pages
77
and
78
of
the
board's
briefs.
section
15
requires
that
all
agreements
between
carriers
be
filed,
including
those
fixing
or
regulating
transportation
rates
or
fares,
pooling
earnings
or
traffic,
allotting
ports
or
regulating
the
sailings
or
volume
or
character
of
freight,
and
also
those
agreements
giving
or
receiving
special
rates,
privileges
or
advantages,
and
those
controlling,
regulating,
preventing
or
destroying
competition.
the
board
is
directed
to
approve
any
such
agreement,
unless
it
finds
it
to
be
unjustly
discriminatory
or
unfair,
detrimental
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
or
in
violation
of
the
act.
approved
agreements
are
accepted
from
the
antitrust
laws.
the
shipping
act
does
not,
the
court
will
note,
enact
a
limited
exception
to
the
antitrust
laws
as
does
the
interstate
commerce
act,
but
moves
along
a
broad
car,
very
far
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction.
no
other
statute
enacted
by
the
congress,
has
ever
gone
so
far
away
from
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
statutory
recognition
of
agreements
controlling,
regulating,
preventing,
or
destroying
competition
is
not
an
exception
to,
but
in
the
field
of
ocean
shipping
is
a
reversal
of
the
antitrust
principles.
the
explanation
of
section
15
is
not
hard
to
find.
from
1875
onwards,
when
the
steam
engines
had
made
regular
liner
service,
the
order
of
the
day,
it
has
been
painfully
evident
that
rate
competition
is
almost
inevitably
destructive
of
ocean
transport
service
and
almost
inevitably
favors
the
large
shippers
over
the
small.
we
show
in
our
main
brief
the
economic
forces
which
inexorably
drive
competing
ocean
liners
into
rate
wars,
in
which
only
the
largest
and
the
strongest
line
can
survive.
it's
sufficient
here
that
the
congressional
committee
which
in
1912
set
out
under
its
resolution
to
investigate
whether
any
such
ship
lines
had
formed
any
agreements
preventing
or
destroying
competition,
ended
up
after
long
and
careful
investigation
by
authorizing
just
such
agreements,
these
were
the
same
men
who
contemporaneously
were
strengthening
and
expanding
in
fields
other
than
ocean
transport,
the
antitrust
laws
by
enactment
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
trade
commission
act.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
there
have
not
been
into
almost
contemporaneously
with
the
enactment
of
the
act.
in
1915,
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
so
called
dual
rate
system
was
not
violative
of
the
sherman
antitrust
law.
in
1917,
this
court
on
a
triple
damage
suit
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes
sir.
the
government's
suits
became
moot.
one
private
triple
damage
suit
survived
and
was
decided
by
this
court.
i
want
to
repeat
the
committee's
reasons
which
must
be
remembered
if
the
shipping
act
of
1916
is
to
be
intelligible
to
a
court,
which
is
more
familiar
with
the
sherman
act
than
with
ocean
trade
rates.
rate
competition,
the
committee
found,
means
rate
wars,
which
in
turn
means
the
death
of
the
weaker
line
and
favoritism
to
the
large
shippers.
yet
rate
regulation
by
a
single
government
was
impossible.
having
found
rate
competition
intolerable
and
rate
regulation
impossible,
the
congress
provided
a
supervised
conference
system
by
which
the
carriers,
subject
to
governmental
protection
against
abuse,
could
reach
rate
agreements.
basically
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
congress,
in
1916,
intended
that
the
conferences,
they
were
thus
establishing
and
making
their
main
reliance
for
control
of
ocean
shipping,
were
to
have
some
capacity
or
none
at
all,
to
protect
themselves
against
dissolution
in
the
face
of
outside
competition.
specifically,
the
issue
in
this
particular
form
is
whether
the
contract
rate
system
is
forbidden
by
section
14
third
of
the
act.
that
section
is
printed
at
page
76
of
our
brief.
it
enacts
four
categories
of
offenses,
each
punishable
by
a
fine
of
$25,000
for
an
offense.
fourteen
first,
forbids
deferred
rebates
precisely
defined
by
the
statute,
as
meaning
giving
a
rebate
for
exclusive
patronage,
both
during
the
agreed
period
in
which
it
accrued
and
a
further
period
of
deferment.
fourteen
second,
prohibited
fighting
ships,
again
precisely
defined.
section
14
fourth,
prohibited
miscellaneous
unfair
practices.
section
14
third
with
which
we
are
here
concerned,
admits,
as
a
matter
of
grammar
of
at
least
three
readings,
literally
it
can
be
read,
to
make
it
unlawful
to
resort
to
discriminating
methods
for
any
reason.
this
would
contradict
or
make
surplusage
virtually
the
whole
of
the
act
and
is
urged
by
none.
the
court
below
and
the
respondents
temper
this
extreme
literalism
and
read
two
qualifications
into
the
broad
prohibition.
it's
unlawful,
they
say,
to
retaliate
against
any
shipper
by
resort
to
other
discriminating
methods
because
that
shipper
had
patronized
any
other
carrier.
this
reading
of
the
court
below,
makes
section
14
first
complete
an
unnecessary
surplusage,
that
the
congress
thus
intended
by
section
14
third
to
outlaw
all
expressive
patronage
rate
inducements.
it
hardly
found
it
necessary
to
make
the
detailed
and
precise
condemnation
of
one
deferred
rebates
which
is
found
in
section
14
first.
we
say
the
statute
should
be
made
consistent
and
surplusage
is
voided
by
carrying
a
gist
in
generous,
one
small
step
farther,
so
that
it
is
unlawful
to
retaliate
against
any
shipper
by
refusing
a
space
accommodation
or
resort
to
similar
discriminating
or
unfair
methods,
because
such
shippers
patronize
any
other
carrier
or
for
any
other
reason.
under
our
view
section
14
third
is
concerned
with
the
denial
of
space
or
service.
it
is
in
that
view
unimportant
here,
whether
or
not
a
contract
rate
system
could
ever
be
called
retaliatory.
that
word
is
however
important
that
section
14
third
should
be
thought
to
reach
to
rate
making.
we
show
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
seven
and
eight
that
as
it
is
universally
defined,
retaliation
simply
cannot
be
stretched
to
include
the
offer
of
a
rate
discount
in
order
to
induce
exclusive
patronage.
the
court
does
not
have
section
14
third
placed
before
it
on
a
fresh
and
newly
turned
page
of
history.
from
1916,
until
the
decision
below
40
years
later,
no
agency
and
no
court
has
ever
read
section
14
third
to
condemn
the
contract
rate
system.
to
the
contrary
the
board
and
its
predecessor
agencies,
from
1922
to
1957,
have
seven
times
held
that
the
contract
rate
system
is
not
prohibited
by
section
14
third.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
other
sir
by
a
uniform
and
widely
applied
rudimentary
rule
of
a
gist
and
generous,
we
say
should
be
read
to
mean
similar.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
one
example
given
to
the
alexander
committee
was
of
lighterage
in
buenos
aires,
for
the
lighterage
firm
is
owned
by
a
conference
member,
people
did
not
ship
by
conference
lines,
found
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
testify,
to
get
the
cargo
alight
at
the
shore.
that
was
the
only
other
concrete
example
given
to
the
committee.
in
point
of
fact,
through
the
testimony
and
through
the
summaries
by
the
committee,
it
is
confined
exclusively
to
denial
of
space
accommodation,
the
last
recommendation
of
the
committee,
the
sixth
time
they
dealt
with
it,
mentioned
or
other
unfair
methods.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
no
sir,
by
the
simple
process
of
reading
other
to
be
similar,
the
act
becomes
consistent
and
consistent
not
only
with
its
text,
but
with
its
very
full
and
very
complete
--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
that's
right
sir,
there
is
nothing
under
the
face
of
the
statute.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
every
complaint
made
to
the
committee
dealt
with
the
denial
of
space
accommodations,
except
for
one,
relating
to
lighterage.
the
committee
directed
itself
explicitly
to
space
accommodations
until
the
final
paragraph
of
its
recommendation,
the
sixth
time
that
it
deal
with
retaliation,
therefore
always
in
terms
of
space
accommodation
and
it
added
those
three
general
words.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
that
is
the
third
we
have
been
discussing,
the
second
is
that
of
the
court
below,
which
limits
what
could
be
the
very
broad
--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
that
was
the
court
below.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
all
right,
the
third,
the
one
which
i
mentioned
first
is
to
take
these
broad
clauses
without
any
of
the
qualifications
which
can
be
attached
to
it
and
find
a
prohibition
against
the
use
of
any
discriminating
method,
which
goes
so
far
as
to
make
a
mockery
of
the
rest
of
the
act.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
it
was
sir.
it
was
denied
by
judge
washington
below.
it's
not
that
contact
are
somehow
different
from
those
concurrently
before
the
court
and
i
believe
the
respondents
say
that
there
is
something
to
distinguished
from
it.
i
have
taken
the
pains
in
pages
12
to
15
of
our
reply
brief
to
provide
a
summary
analysis
of
the
70
contract
rate
arrangements
that
were
exhibited
to
or
described
to
the
committee.
if
you
will
glance
through
the
legislative
history
which
solicitor
general
and
the
board
have
jointly
presented
in
the
court,
you
will
find
virtually
every
witness
asked
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
do
you
have
a
contract
system?
do
you
have
contracts
with
shipper?
the
witnesses
say
yes.
the
chairman
will
pass
on
to
points
that
are
quite
evidently
concerned
him,
did
it
discriminate
between
the
large
shipper
and
the
small
and
some
of
them
did.
the
congress
prohibited
that
discrimination.
they
prohibited
the
deferred
rebate.
they
did
not
prohibit
the
contract
rate
system.
the
reason
sir
is
ready
at
hand.
the
committee
said
at
page
185
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
summarizing
the
disadvantages
of
the
conference
system,
it
included
this
condemnation
of
the
deferred
rebate.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
the
so
called
joint
(inaudible)
which
solicitor
general
and
the
board
have
joined
together
to
commit
to
the
court.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
185.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
by
deferring
the
payment
of
the
rebates
until
three
or
six
months
following
the
period
to
which
the
rebate
applied
ship
owners
effectively
tied
the
merchants
to
a
group
of
line
for
successive
periods.
in
this
connection,
it
is
argued
that
the
ordinary
contract
rate
system,
note
the
ordinary
contract
rate
system,
does
not
place
the
shipper
in
the
position
of
continued
dependence
that
results
in
the
deferred
rebate
system.
the
congress,
just
as
other
countries
dealing
with
the
similar
problem
that
found
the
deferred
rebate
objectionable
did
not
find
the
contract
rate
system
which
did
not
tie
the
shipper
over
for
a
successive
periods
to
be
objectionable.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
if
by
retaliatory
do
you
mean
the
clause
requiring
the
shipper
to
live
up
to
his
agreement,
the
liquidated
damage
clause.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
oh,
certainly.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes
sir,
all
these
contracts
–
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--
provided
a
lower
rate
for
the
shipper
who
signed
the
contract.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
if
he
got
the
lowered
rate
you
had
to
sign
the
contract
in
confining
all
of
his
shipments
to
the
member
lines
or
in
some
cases
the
individual
lines.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes
sir.
you
will
find
a,
what
i
consider
a
complete
index
to
those
contracts
in
our
reply
brief.
they
were
so
numerous
--
the
reference
is
so
numerous
that
on
some
point
or
two
there
maybe
an
error,
but
basically
i
think
you
can
find
any
point
of
those
contract
by
turning
the
pages
--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
if
it
has
not
been
i
am
sure
that
it
is
now
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
i
am
sure
that
it
is
now
if
it's
not
there.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
in
issue.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
in
general
i
think
the
thought
has
been
that
there
weren't
any
contract
rate
system
in
effect
in
1913.
i
think
that
was
a
provision
impossible
to
maintain
and
i
would
expect
the
empirical
shift
to
one
detail
or
another,
but
basically
the
lowered
rates
were
exclusive
patronage,
the
cost
was
recognized
by
the
congress
not
condemned,
present
then
and
present
now.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
you
will
find
the
following;
an
agreed
rate
in
the
contract,
an
agreement
by
the
shipper
to
confine
all
of
his
shipments
through
the
line
or
the
conference
lines.
you
will
not
find
a
recitation
of
the
higher
rate
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
testimony
of
the
man
who
introduced
the
contract
to
explain
that
the
rate
is
lower
than
that
otherwise
charged.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
no
sir,
i
think
there
is
no
provision
for
liquidated
damages
there.
the
actual
damages
were
that
the
conference
rates
demonstrate
be
higher
than
the
liquidated
damages
here
provided.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
no
sir,
no
problem
--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
i
am
thinking
it's
supported
and
relying
on
the
committee
that
passed
the
act
and
on
this
court's
analysis
of
the
act
and
of
the
issue
in
swayne
&
hoyt
in
300
united
states
and
the
consistent
40-year
history
of
board
decisions.
i
fear
my
time
has
expired.
