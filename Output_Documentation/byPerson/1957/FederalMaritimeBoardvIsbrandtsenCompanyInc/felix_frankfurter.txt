there
have
been
decisions
bringing
ocean
traffic
within
the
sherman
law,
have
there
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
had
been
litigation
which
became
moot
during
the
first
world
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gardner,
before
--
may
i
break
in,
before
you
go
on
with
what
is
administrative
or
judicial
construction,
to
go
on
to
your,
abstract
analysis
of
14
third,
and
that's
where
i
followed
you.
you
said
after
rejecting
what
you
would
regard
as
a
conclusion
of
separate,
you
referenced
at
first,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it's
restricted
to
refusal
of
space
accommodation
or
resort
to
other
discriminating
or
unfair
methods,
you
gave
that
sort
of
concrete
confining
process,
meaning.
now
what
is
--
i
follow
the
brief,
i
understand
that,
but
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
resort
to
other
discriminating
or
unfair
methods
in
your
view,
in
that
construction,
this
is
second
view
offered,
what
is
the
confining
limitation
of
other
discriminating
or
unfair
method?
i
understand
space
accommodation
that's
concrete,
now
what
are
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
now
what
are
the
similar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you've
passed
this
and
you've
put
before
me
at
least
dilemma
of
either
dealing
with
first
a
surplusage,
or
third
is
read
out
what
is
the
third,
if
it's
confined
to
space
accommodation
and
i'm
confronted
with
the
other
difficulty
of
giving
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
have
to
fish
around
and
find
out
what
the
other
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
third,
well
i
don't
care
about
merely
the
face
of
the
statute,
we
are
dealing
with
an
industry
and
presumably
congress
addressed
itself
to
the
industry
and
i'm
perfectly
hospitable
to
getting
other
concrete
suggestions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
question,
you
said
there
were
three
possible
readings,
what
is
the
third?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
first
was
that
which
you
found
involves
a
collision
between
first
and
third,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one,
the
second
is
yours
that
it's
used
in
generous,
what's
the
third?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
mr.
gardner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
now
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
an
innocent
question?
if
one
goes
to
the
hearings
of
the
alexander
committee,
are
there
in
those
hearings
set
forth
the
contract
in
terms
by
which
without
anybody's
aid
except
ordinary
intelligent
reading
of
english
i
will
find
the
kind
of
a
provision
that
mr.
chief
justice
referred
namely
two
level
contracts,
two
level
rates;
one
where
a
shipper
bind
themselves
for
a
lower
rate
by
the
conference
and
to
use
those
ships
exclusively
and
one
way
it
does
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
--
the
gravamen
of
the
controversy
doesn't
or
does
it,
i
don't
know,
turn
on
the
question
of
the
enforceability
for
such
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
that
it
exists
is
what
i
--
that's
a
different
question
maybe
irrelevant
today
but
the
essential
question
is
that
you
are
seeking
to
support
an
arrangement
whereby
a
shipper
will
bind
himself
to
use
exclusively
conference
lines
will
get
a
lower
rate
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
as
i
understood
mr.
gardner's
hindsight
was
that
the
contracts
that
were
before
the
alexander
committee
did
not
have
interns,
there
was
provision
in
the
contract
between
the
hearings
whatever
they
extended
themselves
from
15,
16
whatever
it
was
that
there
was
no
provision
in
the
then
outstanding
contracts
of
the
conference
explicitly
stating
the
lower
rate
for
exclusive
patronage,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
contract
we
now
have
is
evidently
has
great
explicitness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
must
be
different,
mr.
gardner
said
it
is
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
difference?
state
the
difference
as
per
the
rate
structure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
this
new
provision
come
in,
as
soon
as
you
came
under
the
maritime
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
as
i
understand
do
you
say
that
contracts
that
were
before
the
committee
about
which
the
chief
justice
interrogated
mr.
gardener,
it
sounds
at
face
a
lesser
rate,
and
to
me
a
lesser
rate
implies
there
must
somewhere
else
to
hide
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
a
little
confused
all
over
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
the
chief
justice
question
and
i
like
to
join
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
i
may
say
we
want
to
know
is
whether
before
the
alexander
commission,
there
were
contracts
which
in
fact
no
matter
how
worded
indicated
to
that
commission
that
an
exclusive
patronage
meant
a
lower
rate
to
the
person,
to
the
shipper
who
availed
himself
of
the
exclusive
patronage.
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
are
you
saying
that
now
the
difference
is
that
now
your
tariffs
have
to
filed
and
therefore
somewhere
in
washington
on
file,
if
that's
where
the
maritime
commission
is,
somewhere
there
is
a
tariff
filed,
a
document
which
tells
you
it's
33
and
when
the
alexander
committee
was
sitting
there
was
no
such
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
independent
lines
are
there
at
the
conference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
independent
lines
unconnected
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know,
but
i
don't,
does
the
act
control,
regulate;
attempted
control
of
one
by
another
or
acquisition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
no
such
specific
provision
is
there
in
the
interstate
commerce
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
the
origin
--
do
we
know
the
origin
of
the
use
of
that
word
in
this
context
or
is
it
just
an
english
word
that
they
thought
was
appropriate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
no
other
meaning
for
the
english
word
retaliate
is
permissible
under
that
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
may
become
important?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
way
reports
are
usually
written,
aren't
they
mr.
o'connor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
addressing
myself
on
that,
but
i
am
sure
you
have
the
same
high
respect
particularly
of
your
experience
for
the
people
who
really
write
these
reports.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
--
am
i
wrong
mr.
elman
in
reading
section
15
as
cutting
into
some
extent,
i'm
not
saying
to
your
extent.
section
15
does
cut
into
the
common
law
of
a
carrier's
liability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
that,
i'm
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
suggesting,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
that
the
common
law
of
common
carrier
is
not
the
measure
of
construction
of
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
about
carrying
any
innuendo
if
it's
relevant
in
this
case
under
the
statute,
under
the
existing
law
may
an
individual
carrier
make
a
dual
rate
contract
to
the
ship,
meaning
by
that
they
are
giving
two
rates
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
whether
one
or
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
main
individual
carriers
say,
i
will
give
you
rate,
rate
of
â€“
the
rate
is
x
for
anybody
coming
along,
it's
x-y
to
deal
exclusively
with
me.
is
it
lawful
under
the
act,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
couldn't
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
revise
on
the
tonnage
of
a
big
shipper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
mr.
elman,
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
this
question,
which
will
indicate
you
in
my
difficulty.
section
15
prohibits
agreement,
an
enumerated
category
of
agreement
except
that
the
board
may
by
order
disprove,
cancel
or
modify
any
agreement
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
haven't
put
my
question
yet.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
file.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
that's
quite
correct,
should
file
in
this
area.
they
can't
do
this
without
going
to
the
board,
that's
what
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
(voice
overlap)
prohibit.
they
can't
do
this
of
their
own
accord.
they've
got
to
go
and
file
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
but
it
enumerates
a
category
of
a
concerted
action
by
ocean
carriers
and
then
the
next
paragraph
says
that
it
may
disapprove,
cancel,
or
modify
or
approve.
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
to,
and
you
emphasized,
if
i
may
say
so
correctly
or
to
be
in
violation
of
this
act.
now,
what
i
want
to
put
to
you
is
this.
the
agreements
which
ocean
carriers
may
file,
deal
with
matters
which
if
they
were
all
out,
it
would
seem
to
be
nonsense
for
congress
to
enumerate.
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
no
such
provision
whereby
they're
authorized
--
they
are
required
to
file
with
specification
such
as
controlling,
regulating,
preventing
or
destroying
competition
such
as
special
raise,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
quite
--
i
understand
that
but
i
say
the
fact
that
the
next
paragraph
authorizes
the
board
to
pass
on
them
presumably
implies
--
you
shake
your
head
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
be
right,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
say
to
you
as
i'm
reading
this
statute
and
comparing
with
the
interstate
commerce
act.
there
is
no
such
provision
that
you
must
file
agreement
on
these
subjects
which
are
outlawed
by
general
categories
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
here,
you've
got
section
1,
anything
pertaining
to
this
subject
you
must
file
and
then
the
board
made
by
order
to
disapprove,
cancel
or
modify
which
at
least
is
alternatively
permitted
to
be
read,
the
board
in
its
discretion
considering
the
public
interest
and
the
nature
of
ocean
shipping
may
then
pass
on
it
whether
the
general
interest
of
the
statute
permit
it.
i'm
not
offering
this
as
my
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
that's
why
i'm
putting
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
appreciate
that
and
what
i
say
to
you
is
what
i
got
out
of
your
own
argument,
namely,
that
the
limitation
upon
board
action
in
the
second
paragraph
of
15
is
not
merely
the
specific
enumeration
but
the
comprehensive
to
be
in
violation
of
this
act,
then
you
go
to
other
provisions
of
the
act
and
where
you
have
specific
limitations.
of
course
they
control.
and
so,
we
are
thrown
back
as
to
the
scope
of
the
specific
limitation,
but
i
suggest
to
you,
you
can't
disregard
the
scope
of
15.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right
about
that
then
the
whole
question
--
the
whole
thing
falls.there's
nothing
more
to
be
fixed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
maybe
right.
i'm
not
saying
you're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
read
that,
if
that's
what
you
--
what
you
say,
is
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
read
that
and
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
