mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
i
speak
for
the
united
states
and
for
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
whose
contention
it
is
that
the
order
of
the
federal
maritime
board
approving
the
dual
rate
system
proposed
in
this
case
by
the
conference
rests
upon
errors
of
law
and
should
therefore
be
set
aside.
as
mr.
gardner
has
stated,
all
parties
accept
the
facts
as
found
by
the
board.
our
disagreement
is
solely
as
to
the
legal
consequences
of
those
facts,
the
central
fact
in
the
case
being
of
course,
the
nature,
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
the
dual
rate
system.
at
the
outset
i
should
state
very
clearly,
that
the
essence
of
that
system
is
an
agreement
among
carriers.
it
is
an
agreement
among
all
the
members
of
the
conference
that
they
will
charge
two
sets
of
rates
to
shippers
for
precisely
the
same
transportation
service,
costing
exactly
the
same
to
the
carrier,
having
the
same
value
to
the
shippers
involved.
they
will
charge
two
system,
two
sets
of
rates
depending
solely
upon
whether
the
shippers
have
agreed
to
give
all
of
their
business
for
the
indefinite
future
exclusively
to
the
conference
upon
penalty
of
a
50%
liquidated
damages
provision
and
where
it
is
admitted
by
the
conference
in
tendering
this
system,
this
agreement
among
themselves
to
the
board
for
approval,
and
where
the
board
itself
recognizes
that
the
purpose
of
this
arrangement
among
the
carriers
is
to
meet
the
competition
of
an
independent
carrier
who
for
reasons
of
his
own,
desires
to
stay
outside
the
conference
and
to
be
independent.
the
purpose
of
this
arrangement
is
to
compel
that
independent
carrier
either
to
join
the
conference
or
to
suffer
a
very
substantial
diminution
of
his
business,
perhaps
even
to
eliminate
him
from
the
trade
entirely.
that
is
the
dual
rate
system.
it
is
a
phenomenon
which
is
unique
to
the
maritime
transportation
industry.
it
is
unknown
in
any
other
mode
of
transportation.
it
is
not
used
by
carriers
or
groups
of
carriers
by
rail,
by
motor,
by
air.
if
any
such
other
mode
of
transportation
attempted
to
use
such
a
system
on
elementary
principles
of
transportation
law,
not
antitrust
law
but
transportation
law,
principles
of
transportation
law
antedating
interstate
commerce
act
of
1887
recognized
a
common
law,
under
those
principles,
such
a
system
would
be
clearly
illegal,
because
it
would
involve
charging
shippers
different
rates
for
precisely
the
same
service
and
the
courts
have
--
from
beginning
of
the
regulation
of
public
utilities
and
common
carriers
applied
the
principle
that
shipper
a
cannot
be
discriminated
against
in
relation
to
shipper
b
for
precisely
exactly
the
same
kind
of
service
he
receives
from
a
common
carrier,
unless
there
is
a
difference
in
the
cost
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes
sir.
our
contention
is,
that
when
an
argument
is
made
to
this
court,
that
congress
has
in
the
shipping
act
of
1916,
made
something
legal
for
the
maritime
business
which
it
has
made
illegal
for
every
other
business,
certainly
one
would
expect
to
find
rather
clear,
rather
explicit
indication
of
congressional
purpose,
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
the
statute
or
at
least
in
the
committee
reports
which
accompanied
the
statute.
on
the
contrarily
we
find
here
the
reliance
is
not
what
is
in
the
statute,
but
rather
on
what
is
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
philip
elman
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
no
you're
not
wrong.
section
15
carries
out
what
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
1916
to
legalize
conference
agreements,
which
would
otherwise
be
illegal
to
the
extent
that
those
agreements
among
the
carriers
fixed
rates
among
themselves,
but
congress
didn't
stop
there,
congress
didn't
give
the
conferences
a
blank
check
anymore
than
it
gave
a
federal
maritime
board
a
blank
check.
mr.
philip
elman
the
question,
the
question
of
this,
the
meaning
of
this
statute
we
think
it
can
be
determined
entirely
within
the
four
borders
of
that
statute.
we
rely
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
rely
on
what
the
committee
said
and
rather
as
a
board
and
the
petitioner,
and
the
petitioner
conference
rely,
not
on
what
was
said
by
the
committee,
but
what
was
said
to
the
committee.
the
reliance
in
this,
in
the
legislative
history
and
i
think
that
there
perhaps
maybe
some
misunderstanding
as
mr.
o'connor
has
pointed
to
this.
the
government
has
furnished
to
the
court
for
its
conveyance
a
joint
appendix
setting
forth
the
excerpts
from
the
alexander
report
upon
which
reliance
is
made
here.
but
everything
prior
to
page
195
of
that
report,
not
a
word
in
this
joint
appendix
prior
to
page
195
of
the
report
was
written
by
the
committee
or
in
its
name
as
a
recommendation
of
the
committee.
the
recommendations
of
the
committee
appear
on
the
last
ten
pages
of
volume
4
of
the
alexander
report.
what
was
has
been
read
to
your
honors
by
petitioner's
counsel
is
a
summary
of
the
recommendations
made
by
witnesses
before
the
committee.
now
mr.
o'connor
pointed
out
that
professor
huebner
wrote
that
summary,
he
was
writing
it
as
a
summary
of
a
testimony
before
the
committee.
now
i
don't
think
that
that
the
materials
referred
to
have
any
great
significance
even
if
they
were
directly
the
product
of
the
committee
itself,
but
i
thought
it's
important
to
clarify
that
point.
the
dual
rate
system
as
a
system
of
excluding
competition,
as
system
for
agreement
among
carriers
is
of
relatively
recent
origin
even
in
the
maritime
industry.
it
came
into
common
use
in
the
1920s
long
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
in
this
particular
trade,
the
japan
atlantic
trade,
it
appears
for
the
first
time,
as
the
board
found
in
its
report
in
1928,
at
that
time
it
was
limited
to
three
commodities,
in
1934
it
was
extended
across
the
board
to
the
major
important
commodities.
with
the
advent
of
hostilities
in
1941
all
that
stopped.
it
was
not
--
the
dual
rate
system
was
not
resumed
after
world
war
ii.
the
respondent
isbrandtsen
is
the
18th
the
lone
rugged
individualist
of
the
--
of
this
trade
as
in
other
trades.
it
entered
this
trade
in
1949.
it
suffers
under
certain
serious
competitive
disadvantages.
it
has
only
26
sailings
a
year
as
compared
to
300
of
the
conference
vessels.
its
equipment
does
not
match
that
of
conference
vessels.
it
does
not
go
the
gulf
course.
so
as
the
board
found
here
any,
any
shipper
or
exporter
from
japan
who
has
a
need
for
service
more
frequent
than
the
fortnightly
service
offered
by
isbrandtsen,
who
needs
special
shelf
rooms
or
refrigeration
service
not
offered
by
isbrandtsen
such
a
shipper
has
to
use
the
conference
vessels.
despite
that
--
those
handicaps
isbrandtsen
in
the
years
1949
to
1953
was
able
to
enjoy
a
very
substantial
share
of
the
business
here.
it
was
able
to
do
so
because
of
its
policy
of
consistently
offering
lower
rates.
it
was
--
its
policy
was
to
offer
rates
10%
lower
than
those
offered
by
the
conference.
as
a
result
many
shippers
to
whom
that
10%
difference
was
important
used
isbrandtsen
despite
some
of
the
disadvantages
of
doing
so.
the
conference
was
thus
confronted
with
--
to
a
very
serious
problem.
it
responded
to
it
in
two
ways.
first
in
december
in
1952
it
proposed
this
dual
rate
system
for
the
federal
maritime
board.
it
proposed
that
that
system
which
had
not
been
in
use
since
1941
should
again
be
instituted.
the
conference
took
another
action,
a
very
important
action
within
three
months
thereafter
before
the
federal
maritime
board
could
take
any
action
on
this
proposal
for
a
dual
rate
system.
in
march
of
1953
a
proposal
was
made
within
the
conference
that
it,
that
there
be
a
20%
reduction
of
the
conference
rates
in
order
to
meet
isbrandtsen's
competition.
that
proposal
was
rejected,
instead
the
conference
decided
to
open
the
rates,
that
is
that
it
would
no
longer
hold
any
of
the
conference
lines
bound
by
the
conference
fixed
rate.
the
board
found
that
the
purpose
of
that
action,
the
hope
of
the
conference
in
opening
the
rates
was
that
the
rate
war,
which
would
thereafter
ensue,
would
leave
isbrandtsen
to
join
the
conference.
or
in
the
alternative
that
it
would
lead
to
the
institution
of
the
dual
rate
system.
as
a
result
of
that
rate
war,
isbrandtsen,
as
mr.
gardner
stated,
has
effectively
lost
almost
all
of
its
business
in
this
trade,
nonetheless
it
did
not
join
the
conference.
the
conference
succeeded,
however,
in
its
second
phase.
the
federal
maritime
board
has
approved
this
dual
rate
system.
now
we
contend
that
in
doing
so
the
federal
maritime
board
misconstrued
the
statute.
it
applied
an
erroneous
standard
of
law.
we
think
that
congress
in
enacting
this
statute,
as
is
stated
in
the
last
10
pages
of
this
joint
appendix
and
the
committee
report
itself,
congress
found
in
1916
that
these
shipping
conferences
or
shipping
rings
had
established
domination
over
the
shipping
business.
the
choice
before
congress
was
either
to
prohibit
these
combinations
entirely,
apply
the
principles
of
strict
free
competition
or
to
legalize
them
entirely
or
without
any
restraints
at
all
or
a
third
alternative,
the
one
actually
chosen
by
congress
was
to
legalize
these
agreements,
permit
the
conferences
to
get
together
among
themselves
fix
rates
subject
to
effective
governmental
restrain.
now
in
1916,
the
problem
of
meeting
non-conference
competition
was
just
as
important
as
it
is
now.
the
dual
rate
system
wasn't
used
because
there
were
far
more
effective
methods
used.
first
most
effective
was
a
so
called
deferred
rebate
system
whereby
a
shipper
who
violated
his
commitment
to
use
all
the
vessels
of
a
conference
lost
a
rebate,
a
fixed
rebate.
another
method
that
was
used
was
a
so
called
fighting
ship.
that
was
a
ship
used
by
--
subsidized
by
all
of
the
members
of
the
conference,
it
went
into
a
particular
port
where
the
independent
was,
it
was
equivalent
to
a
lost
leader
and
that
ship
consistently
undercut
the
independent,
so
the
independent
either
had
to
join
the
conference
or
go
out
of
business.
those
were
the
crude
but
very
effective
methods
that
were
in
use
in
1916.
the
dual
rate
system
was
not
in
use.
it
is
true
as
has
been
mentioned
that
there
were
contracts
between
carriers,
individual
carriers
and
individual
shippers.
those
were
negotiated
contracts
for
the
most
part.
they
varied
in
length
of
time,
they
varied
in
the
differential,
but
the
crucial
difference,
the
essential
difference
is
that
those
were
not
contracts
among
the
members
of
the
conference
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
competition.
you
will
find
what
the
board
itself
characterizes
as
a
sample
of
such
a
contract
on
page
44
of
its
brief,
brief
with
a
light
grey
cover.
and
i
must
say
in
all
honesty
that
we
have
not
found
any
other
contract
precisely
along
these
lines,
it
goes
quite
as
far
as
being
conference
among
more
than
one
carrier,
a
contract
between
more
than
one
carrier.
but
assuming
this
is
the
best,
this
is
the
closest
you
can
get
to
something
evidencing
a
dual
rate
system
prior
to
enactment
of
the
shipping
act,
it
falls
very
far
from
what
we
have
here
which
is
a
conference
agreement.
an
agreement
among
the
ship
--
among
the
ship
lines
themselves
whereby
they
establish
two
systems
of
rates,
systems
of
rates.
all
this
contract
did
on
page
44
is
a
negotiated
contract
on
behalf
of
named
carriers
specifying
named
rates
for
named
commodities.
and
this
one
contains
a
firm
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
alliance
to
provide
space
and
as
judge
washington
pointed
it's
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
a
requirements
contract
whereby
the
seller
makes
a
firm
commitment
as
this
space
where
space
is
important
and
when
there
is
no
--
mr.
philip
elman
an
individual
carrier
with
one
shipper?
mr.
philip
elman
with
one
shipper?
mr.
philip
elman
well
let
me
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
it's
a,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
the
problem
would
be
precisely
the
same
under
this
act
as
it
would
be
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
if
you
had
such
a
contract
which
presumably
would
not
run
afoul
with
the
specific
probation
with
section
14
which
i
am
going
to
talk
about
later.
but
assuming
14
isn't
there
and
it's
just
the
question
of
unjust
discrimination,
your
initial
question
would
be
whether
the
obligation
to
give,
give
all
of
your
--
the
commitment
to
give
on
part
of
the
shipper
to
give
all
of
its
business
exclusively
to
a
carrier
and
would
entitle
him
to
a
difference
in
rates.
suppose
for
example
an
individual
railroad
undertook
to
make
such
an
agreement.
mr.
philip
elman
i
would,
i
would
assume
that
the
principle
that
forbids
discrimination
against
shippers
unless
there
is
a
difference
in
service
would
preclude
it.
but
let's
assume
that
you
don't
apply
that
here.
at
the
very
least
if
you
--
if
the
shipper
who
receives
a
discount
because
he
commits
all
of
his
business
to
the
carrier,
the
spread,
the
differential
should
bear
some
relation
to
a
difference
in
costs.
if
you
could,
if
you
could
show
that
by
reason
of
an
exclusive
patronage
contract,
an
individual
carrier
is
enabled
to
make
some
savings
in
this
hour
in
determining
a
saving
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
he
can
show
--
if
he
can
show
that
he
saves
x
amount,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
very
least
you
have
to
show
that
the
x
amount,
which
the
shipper
is
given
by
way
of
a
reduction
is
the
same.
now
of
course
this
differential
is
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
if
--
that
it
is
not
measured
at
all
by
any
differences
in
cost,
any
savings
to
the
carrier.
the
only
reason
for
the
differential,
the
basis
upon
which
it
was
computed
was
effective
to
accomplish
its
purpose
namely
to
take
the
business
away
from
isbrandtsen
and
bring
it
back
to
the
conference
and
by
bringing
it
back
from
the
conference,
it
would
enable
a
conference
to
fill
these
otherwise
half
empty
vessels.
mr.
philip
elman
if
the
court
please.
by
way
of
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
the
legality
of
a
dual
rate
formula
used
by
a
single
carrier,
let
me
refer
to
the
first
case
arising
before
the
shipping
board
as
to
dual
rate.
in
1922,
the
eden
mining
company
case
which
is
cited
and
quoted
and
discussed
starting
at
page
51
of
the
government's
brief.
that
case
arose
and
was
decided
by
the
board
not
under
section
14,
since
section
14
was
not
involved.
that's
a
collective
retaliation
section
but
under
section
16
and
17.
and
the
board
found
that
a
dual
rate
formula,
when
used
by
a
single
carrier,
is
illegal.
and
the
board
said
that
it
is
evident
that
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
these
provisions
of
the
statute
was
to
impose
upon
common
carriers
within
the
purview
thereof,
the
duty
of
charging
uniform
rates
to
all
shippers
we've
seen
in
a
similar
transportation
service.
the
board
went
on
to
refer
the
leading
i.c.c.
case,
the
western
union
telegraphic
company
case,
181
u.s.,
reading
from
the
bottom
of
the
page,
but
that
principle
of
equality
does
forbid
any
difference
in
charge
which
is
not
based
on
difference
in
service
and
even
when
based
upon
difference
of
service
must
have
some
reasonable
relation
to
the
amount
of
difference.
now,
we
have
undertaken
to
meet
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
there's
been
a
consistent
administrative
construction
of
the
board
here.
the
dual
rate
system
is
perfectly
all
right
by
showing
as
judge
frank
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
for
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
north
atlantic
case.
but
the
board
--
the
board
which
really
of
course
represents
four
successive
agencies.
first,
the
shipping
board
then
the
secretary
of
commerce
then
the
maritime
commission
and
now
the
federal
maritime
board.
their
decisions
of
every
--
have
gone
every
which
way
on
this
and
it
wasn't
really
until
1933,
17
years
after
the
shipping
act,
you
have
the
first
case
upholding
a
dual
rate
system
when
used
by
carriers.
mr.
philip
elman
1933.
that's
the
rowley
case
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
immediately
after
the
eden
case.
that's
the
secondary
case.
that
--
that
is
1933,
17
years
after
the
act,
far
from
a
contemporaneous
interpretation,
inconsistent
with
the
eden
case
which
i've
mentioned.
now,
i
have
--
i
said
at
the
outset
that
we
--
we
regard
the
order
of
the
board
here
which
is
under
a
--
which
is
what's
on
the
review
as
being
infected
with
areas
of
the
law.
we
think
that
the
board
applied
an
erroneous
standard.
the
board
here
conceded
that
the
dual
rate
system
was
discriminatory,
that
it
was
monopolistic,
conceded
that
it
was
--
its
purpose
was
anti-competitive
to
eliminate
an
independent
--
from
business
or
to
join
a
con
--
conference.
the
board
nevertheless
said,
those
--
that
discrimination,
that
monopolistic
feature
is
outweighed
by
the
fact
that
it
produces
rate
stability.
it
eliminates
competition
among
carriers
as
to
rates
and
stability
of
rate
is
a
good
thing
and
it's
a
justification.
now,
we
find
on
our
reading
of
the
statute
and
our
reading
of
the
committee
report
that
while
congress
was
concerned
with
rate
stability
and
was
anxious
to
maintain
rate
stability.
it
didn't
make
an
absolute
dogma
of
rate
stability.
it
permitted
the
board
in
considering
whether
to
approve
conference
agreements
under
section
15,
to
consider
whether
such
an
agreement
would
be
desirable,
would
produce
stability.
but
that
was
an
agreement
among
the
carriers
themselves
as
to
what
each
one
of
them
was
charged.
and
--
and
congress
has
said
“yes,
the
board
has
the
power
to
permit
this
car
--
conference
carriers
to
form
an
association
among
themselves
so
they
can
fix
their
own
rate,
they
can
eliminate
rate
competition
among
each
other.
you
can
have
stability
to
that
extent.”
but
congress
didn't
stop
with
section
15.
congress
put
in
the
statute,
section
14
and
section
16
and
17
--
16
and
17
which
are
on
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
60
--
pages
65
and
66,
those
provisions
are
taken
from
the
interstate
commerce
act.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
cunard
case
and
the
swayne
&
hoyt
case.
congress
permitted
the
board
to
suspend
pro
tanto
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
extent
that
it
could
approve
these
conference
agreements
fixing
rates
among
themselves.
but
congress
went
further.
it
subjected
these
conferences
to
the
--
the
restrictions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that
was
done
in
16
and
17,
16
and
17
says
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
between
shippers,
that's
the
consequence
of
dual
rate
system.
but
specifically,
congress
didn't
even
stop
with
16
and
17,
congress
put
in
section
14.
section
14
is
cashed
in
terms
of
outright
prohibitions.
it
prohibits
in
section
first
the
deferred
rate
--
rebate
system.
now,
the
deferred
rebate
system
was
the
system
which
was
then
widely
used
prior
to
1916.
that
was
the
system
for
eliminating
competition.
that
was
the
system
for
producing
rate
stability.
that
was
the
system
that
would
prevent
rate
wars
to
the
extent
that
it
was
effective,
you
have
a
complete
destruction,
elimination
of
independent
competition.
congress
said
“no,
you
--”
to
the
board,
“you
can't
approve
that
because
in
section
15
the
grant
of
power
to
the
board
to
approve
conference
agreements
is
specifically
limited.”
the
board
is
given
no
power
to
approve
any
agreement
which
is
that
it
--
which
is
unjustly
discriminatory
unfair
as
between
carriers
which
operates
the
detrimental
commerce
of
the
united
states
or
in
violation
of
this
act.
and
to
find
out
whether
it's
in
violation
of
the
act,
you
look
to
the
whole
act.
not
just
section
15,
you
look
at
14
as
well
as
16
and
17.
and
if
a
--
if
an
agreement
is
in
violation
of
section
14,
the
board
has
no
power
to
approve
it.
now,
section
14,
second
--
prohibits
a
fighting
ship,
again
a
fighting
ship
is
a
device
to
deal
with
competition
of
independence.
it
produces
rate
stability.
but
certainly,
if
the
federal
maritime
board
could
not
enter
an
order
today
saying
that
a
fighting
ship
or
a
deferred
rebate
or
the
specific
restraint
mentioned
in
14
third,
a
refusal
or
a
threat
--
or
a
threat
of
refuse
of
space
accommodations,
suppose
it
--
suppose
a
conference
came
to
the
board
and
offered
to
setup
a
system
providing
further
deferred
rebate,
fighting
ship
or
refusal
of
space
accommodation.
could
the
board
use
as
the
standard
of
law
under
section
14,
the
proposition?
well,
this
will
produce
rate
stability
and
we
think
that
in
this
industry,
competition
isn't
a
good
thing
and
therefore
we
will
permit
it.
the
answer
is
section
14
precludes
the
board
from
taking
in
to
consideration
that
standard.
it's
a
standard
for
approving
agreements
among
the
conference
--
conference
carriers
themselves.
they
can
fix
rates
among
each
other
but
they
can't
--
they
can't
agree
also
that
they
will
go
after
an
independent
carrier
who
wishes
to
stay
outside
the
conference
and
drive
them
in
to
the
conference
or
drive
them
out
of
business.
now,
section
14
third
which
has
been
the
main
provision
in
this
case,
prohibits
retaliation
against
any
shipper
by
refusing
or
threatening
to
refuse
space
accommodation
when
such
are
available,
specific
or
resort
to
other
discriminating
or
unfair
methods.
now,
congress
specifically
outlawed
these
three
things
that
were
unused
--
used
then,
but
it
didn't
stop
there,
it
flatly,
sweepingly
then
every
discriminating
or
unfair
method
which
was
used
because
such
shipper
has
patronized
any
other
carrier
or
has
filed
a
complaint
charging
unfair
treatment
or
for
any
other
reason.
so
you
have
two
catchall
clauses
here.
you've
got
a
catchall
clause
condemning
every
method
which
is
unfair
and
discriminating
which
is
used
to
retaliate
against
the
shippers
who
reserve
the
right
to
patronize
carriers
and
retaliation
is
not
merely
for
patronizing
another
carrier
but
for
any
other
reason.
now,
the
board
has
construed
section
14
and
that
--
and
these
errors
of
law
light
the
very
threshold
of
it's
--
of
its
report.
the
board
has
construed
section
14
as
if
these
two
catchall
clauses
weren't
in
there
at
all.
i
refer
specifically
to
page
52
of
its
report
where
the
board
said
--
after
referring
to
the
swayne
&
hoyt
case
and
to
the
legislative
material,
mr.
gardner
has
referred
to.
the
board
says
in
--
in
support
of
the
view
that
congress
intended
in
the
act
to
prohibit
only
those
practices
specifically
condemned,
we
offer
the
following
testimony
of
a
witness
on
another
bill
which
did
not
become
a
shipping
act.
the
--
the
board
expresses
the
view
that
section
14
third
covers
only
the
specific
practices
and
if
i
may
finish
the
sentence
mr.
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
elman
in
page
58
--
in
page
58
of
its
report,
referring
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
“retaliation”
and
this
is
in
the
question
of
administrative
expertise.
the
board
has
no
greater
insight
into
the
meaning
of
these
words
than
others
have.
the
board
says
the
word
--
quoting
and
relying
on
its
prior
opinion
in
the
north
atlantic
freight
conference
case,
which
was
a
case
that
came
here
in
1952.
the
board
adopts
the
view
--
that
the
higher
rate
cannot
be
said
to
be
charged
as
a
retaliation
for
patronizing
any
other
carrier.
it
is
charged
because
the
shipper
does
not
sign
the
contract
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he
patronizes
any
other
carrier.
a
non-signing
shipper
who
does
not
patronize
a
north
conference
carrier
is
treated
as
harshly
as
a
non-signing
shipper
who
ships
partially
and
exclusively
with
such
a
carrier.
in
other
words,
the
--
or
for
any
other
reason,
is
--
is
not
given
any
concern
of
this
--
of
the
50
pages
of
this
report,
more
than
32
pages
are
devoted
to
discussion
of
law,
discussion
of
swayne
&
hoyt
case
in
which
the
board
takes
out
of
context
the
footnote
by
mr.
justice
stone
referring
to
legislative
history
giving
it
a
meaning
it
doesn't
bare.
the
board
has
not
quoted
the
statute.
we
think
that
there's
an
error
of
law
in
leaving
out
of
its
consideration
of
these
two
catchall
clauses.
under
the
board's
construction
if
there
were
a
flat
refusal
by
conference
carriers
to
--
of
space
accommodations
specifically
outlawed
under
14
third.
nevertheless,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
the
refusal
was
not
for
patronizing
another
carrier
but
because
they
merely
reserve
the
right
to
do
so
by
failing
to
enter
into
an
exclusive
patronage
of
payment.
that
we
say
is
an
error
of
law
requiring
reversal
of
the
board's
order.
mr.
philip
elman
may
i
--
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt?
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
you
--
you're
inaccurate
in
your
statement
in
section
15
because
section
15
in
the
first
paragraph
doesn't
prohibit
anything.it
merely
requires
conference
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
carriers
to
file.
it's
just
for
filing.
it
doesn't
prohibit
it.
mr.
philip
elman
they've
got
to
file
everything
with
the
board.
mr.
philip
elman
file.
mr.
philip
elman
right.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
a
publicity
requirement
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
shake
my
head
because
i
disagree,
sir.
because
the
next
paragraph
significantly
begins
the
board
may
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
by
order
to
disapprove
and
then
it
goes
on,
if
i
may
finish,
and
at
the
last
sent
--
the
last
clause
of
that
paragraph
is,
“and
shall
approve
all
other
agreements.”
the
plain
implication
is
the
--
an
agreement
which
is
invalid
under
the
statute
need
not
be
disapproved
by
the
board
because
no
board
action
of
disapproval
is
required
under
the
statute.
the
statute
makes
it
illegal
not
in
the
action
of
the
board
so
therefore
the
board
doesn't
have
to
do
anything.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
can
only
read
the
statute
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
may
i
offer
an
answer
to
it?
mr.
philip
elman
the
answer
to
that
is
that
on
that
construction
of
section
15
that
the
board
sits
there
to
prove
or
disapprove
of
everything.
section
14
serves
no
function
that
if
the
board
--
if
the
board
has
the
authority
to
just
sit
there
and
decide
what's
the
best
interest
of
the
shipping
industry,
or
what's
in
the
best
interest
of
an
efficient
merchant
marine,
congress
has
given
the
board
an
entirely
free
hand.
they
can
do
anything
what
they
think
is
best.
i
think
there
might
be
some
other
objections
but
certainly
it
is
a
--
a
sufficient
objection
to
such
a
construction
of
section
15
that
congress
enacted
specific
provision
in
section
14
as
to
what
the
board
could
not
approve.
mr.
philip
elman
we
think
that
the
statute
has
to
be
read
together.
section
15
and
section
14
of
course
are
parts
of
the
same
statute
and
not
to
be
read
(inaudible).
we
think
--
we
think
that
when
the
congress
specifically
forbad
all
methods
of
retaliation
which
are
discriminatory
or
unfair
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
well.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
if
we
--
we
think
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
you
--
mr.
philip
elman
you
read
that.
you
read
it
in
the
context
of
the
whole
statute,
read
it
in
the
context
to
the
committee
report,
read
it
in
the
context
to
what
this
court
said
as
distinguished
from
its
--
its
dicta
in
the
swayne
&
hoyt
case
and
we
think
that
the
answer
is
clear.
mr.
philip
elman
thank
you.
