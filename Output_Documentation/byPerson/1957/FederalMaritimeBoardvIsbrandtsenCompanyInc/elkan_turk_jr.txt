mr.
elkan
turk
you
heard
the
pleasure
of
mr.
o'connor's
presentation.
mr.
elkan
turk
yes.
i
would
like
to
say
in
addition
to
what
mr.
gardner
has
told
you
that
the
following
appears
in
the
alexander
committee
report
which
appears
on
page
161
of
this
joint
appendix
presented
by
the
two
government
departments.
it's
contractual
shippers
which
maybe
classified
as
follows,
a)
joint
contracts
made
by
the
conference
as
a
whole,
such
contracts
are
made
for
the
account
of
all
of
the
alliance
in
the
agreement.
each
carrying
its
proportion
of
the
contract
freight
as
tended
from
time
to
time.
the
contracting
lines
agree
to
furnish
steamers
at
regular
intervals
and
the
shipper
agrees
to
confine
all
of
his
shipments
to
the
conference
steamers
and
to
announce
the
quantity
of
cargo
to
be
shipped
in
ample
time
to
allow
for
proper
supply
of
tonnage.
the
rates
on
such
contracts
are
less
than
those
specified
in
the
regular
tariff.
but
the
alliance
generally
pursued
a
policy
of
giving
the
small
shipper
the
same
contract
rates
as
the
large
shipper
i.e.
willing
at
all
times
to
contract
with
all
shippers
on
the
same
terms.
the
way
that
that
appeared
is
a
--
was
accurately
stated
by
mr.
gardner,
perhaps
i
should
like
to
emphasis
it.
the
carriers
would
produce
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
or
request
of
the
alexander
committee
a
contract
which
they
had
made
say
with
the
international
harvester
company
at
a
certain
rate.
then
they
would
be
asked
whether
or
not
that
same
contract
at
the
same
rate
would
be
open
to
other
shippers
of
agricultural
influence.
the
answer
would
be
if
they
sign
the
contract,
yes.
and
the
question
is
what
would
they
pay
if
they
didn't
sign
the
contract,
and
this
was
an
exclusive
patronage
contract,
the
answer
was
they
would
pay
then
the
regular
tariff
rates.
now
this
--
there
is
no
question
about
that
that
the
alexander
committee
thought
of
such
contracts
and
i
think
that
after
looking
at
the
reply
brief
of
the
federal
maritime
board
with
its
70
illustrations,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
any
one
--
any
reasonable
person
will
be
convinced
that
they
actually
did
see
that
sort
of
contract
and
that
they
didn't
condemn
it.
mr.
elkan
turk
it
stated
the
lower
rate,
but
it
didn't
say
that
there
was
also
a
higher
rate,
nor
does
our
contract.
mr.
elkan
turk
no,
no
it
merely
says,
--
mr.
elkan
turk
well
--
mr.
elkan
turk
as
far
as
a
rate
structure
is
concerned
today
we
have
a
federal
maritime
board
and
we
file
a
tariff
of
contract
–
mr.
elkan
turk
--
and
non-contract
rates.
the
contract
merely
entitles
the
shipper
to
the
contract
rates.
it
doesn't
say
that
anyone
who
doesn't
sign
must
pay
the
non-contract
rate.
mr.
elkan
turk
the
first
actual
contract
system
after
the
shipping
act
was
adopted
came
into
affect
in
1922,
but
in
the
mean
time
we'd
have
the
war
with
the
destruction
of
tonnage
and
the
american
government
really
was
the
only
carrier.
then
as
soon
as
the
foreign
shipping
sprang
up
again
and
there
was
an
overtonnaging,
immediately
they
have
this
cut
rate
competition
and
the
maritime
board
itself
in
those
days
the
old
shipping
board
took
the
initiative
and
said
we've
got
to
have
a
conference
to
govern
these
rates
and
the
first
contract
system
was
at
that
time
adopted
and
that's
now
been
35
years
ago.
mr.
elkan
turk
it
doesn't
say,
i
think
that
mr.
gardner
will
agree
that
it
didn't
say
this
is
a
lesser
rate,
they
say
that
your
rate
is
so
and
so.
mr.
elkan
turk
the
testimony
was
--
mr.
elkan
turk
i
am
sorry.
mr.
elkan
turk
yes.
mr.
elkan
turk
that
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
this,
that
if
you
take
the
contract
and
the
testimony
of
both
the
carriers
and
the
shippers,
you
know
that
this
rate
that
is
specified
is
the
lower
of
that
two
rates
and
the
same
thing
would
be
true
of
our
contract.
if
you'd
look
at
our
contract,
you'd
have
to
go
to
external
evidence
which
is
our
tariff
to
see
what
the
higher
rate
is.
i
hope
i've
answered
the
question.
mr.
elkan
turk
yes.
mr.
elkan
turk
that's
right,
you
would
see
in
our
tariff
that
in
our
contract
that
he
is
entitled
to
contract
rates.
then
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
tariff
to
see
what
--
dependant
on
what
he
wants
to
ship.
today
he
may
want
to
ship
groceries
and
tomorrow
hardware
and
unless
you
went
to
the
tariff
you
wouldn't
know
what
the
rate
on
groceries
was
contract
and
non-contract,
no
other
rate
on
hardware
contract.
mr.
elkan
turk
those
were
secrets
at
that
time.
mr.
elkan
turk
that
was
the
only
difference
but
in
substance
there
was
actually
no
difference.
there
are
a
couple
of
points
of
fact
that
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
for
a
moment
before
i
discuss
the
legal
aspect
of
this
thing.
mr.
gardner
i
think
fail
to
give
to
the
court
the
impression
of
the
extent
to
which
isbrandtsen's
rate
cutting
does
diminish
the
carryings
of
the
conference
lines.
by
1953,
after
this
had
gone
on
for
three
or
four
years,
isbrandtsen's
vessels
were
carrying
three
times
as
much
japanese
cargo
per
vessel
as
the
conference
lines
and
i'd
like
just
to
canvas
with
you
for
a
moment
what
the
effect
of
that
sort
of
difference
is.
the
business
of
ocean
carriage
is
one
what
the
economists
call
a
business
of
increasing
profits
or
decreasing
costs.
a
ship
is
a
tremendous
carrying
inflexible
entity,
and
if
you
start
that
ship
on
its
voyage
you
incur
all
of
the
expenses
by
way
of
crews'
wages
and
subsistence
on
fuel
and
the
overhead
item
such
as
depreciation,
if
she
is
full
or
if
she
is
empty.
the
result
is
that
if
you
pass
a
certain
breakeven
point
on
your
costs,
over
and
above
the
actual
cost
of
loading
and
discharge,
the
more
cargo
you
carry,
the
more
profit
you
make
and
correspondingly
the
less
cargo
you
carry,
the
greater
your
loses
are.
therefore
if
you
have
the
apparent
anomaly
that
isbrandtsen
while
charging
10%
less
than
the
conference,
is
making
good
money
whereas
the
conference
lines
by
carrying
less
than
the
breakeven
point
at
a
10%
higher
rate
are
losing
and
losing
very
heavily,
the
evidence
was
here
$500,000
a
month.
another
thing
i
would
like
to
bring
out
is
what
is
the
nature
of
a
conference?
a
conference
is
not
a
monolithic
unit
by
any
means.
the
conference
agreement
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
their
only
common
interest
is
in
fixing
rates.
they
do
not
pool
earnings,
they
do
not
fix
sailings.
they
have
no
common
interest
by
way
of
stock
holdings
and
when
they
get
through
with
fixing
the
rate,
from
that
time
on,
they
are
the
most
vigorous
competitors
and
that
competition
takes
the
form
not
of
cutting
rates,
as
long
as
the
conference
is
not
subjected
to
this
sort
of
competition,
but
in
the
matter
of
service
and
today
in
these
trades
we
have
vessels
that
are
capable
of
making
18
and
20
and
greater
speed
than
that,
i'm
speaking
of
knots,
whereas
in
the
days
when
the
first
conference
here
was
organized
they
were
happy
to
have
a
10
knot
steamer
and
only
three
a
month
and
today
as
mr.
gardner
said
they
have
300
a
year,
that
is
the
effect
of
eliminating
rate
competition
and
bringing
into
effect
competition
by
way
of
service.
mr.
elkan
turk
how
many?
mr.
elkan
turk
there
are
17,
of
which
two
i
think
must
be
eliminated
for
this
reason,
that
one
of
them
goes
around
through
suez
and
the
other
one
carries
cargo
only
to
the
gulf
and
isbrandtsen
doesn't
carry
cargo
to
the
gulf
so
that
i
think
that
we
must
speak
here
of
15
lines
who
have
this
interest.
now
and
therefore
when
mr.
gardner
said
that
as
the
board
found,
the
conference
might
carry
approximately
90%
of
the
cargo
if
the
dual
rate
system
was
in
effect
and
isbrandtsen
10%,
to
find
out
what
the
individual
conference
line
would
average
you
would
have
to
divide
the
90
by
15
and
you
will
see
that
isbrandtsen
would
come
out
better
even
if
we
had
the
contract
system
in
effect
so
far
as
carryings
are
concerned,
although
they
would
not
have
the
tremendous
advantage
that
they
did
--
that
they
have
had
up
to
the
time
when
this
great
competition
came
in,
when
they
were
carrying
three
to
one
over
us.
mr.
elkan
turk
yes,
they
have
absolutely
no
interest
one
on
the
other
and
i
can
assure
you
that
in
every
way
they
are
at
each
other's
throats
except
that
they
agree
on
rates.
mr.
elkan
turk
you
would
have
to
judge
that
by
section
15,
which
says
all
agreements
among
common
carriers
or
other
persons
subject
to
the
act,
which
effect
or
control
or
regulate
competition
must
be
filed
and
approved
and
my
answer
to
you
would
be
this,
that
i
assume
that
(inaudible)
merger
might
not
require
--
mr.
elkan
turk
no,
not
affecting
consolidations
or
mergers.
having
passed
over
that
--
those
economic
features,
i'd
like
to
consider
with
you
something
of
the
broad
basis
of
this
legislation.
now
mr.
gardner
says
it
travels
in
the
up
direction
which
is
opposite
to
the
direction
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act,
and
i'd
like
to
examine
with
you
for
a
moment
why
that
is
necessarily
so.
when
you
come
to
ocean
shipping,
as
contrasted
even
with
such
public
service
companies
as
the
railroads
and
the
telephone
company,
you
have
to
deal
with
different
nationalities.
in
the
course
of
every
voyage,
let
us
say
in
the
japan,
atlantic
and
gulf
trade,
you
have
not
alone
the
laws
of
japan
to
take
into
account,
but
also
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
vice
versa.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
engaged
in
this
trade
vessels
of
many
other
nationalities
who
have
treaties
of
friendship
and
commerce
with
us
and
when
you
come
to
the
matter
of
over
tonnaging
which
mr.
gardner
expressed,
when
you
come
to
the
matter
of
that
kind,
you
find
that
our
government
is
not
able
to
deal
with
the
problem
at
all
because
we
cannot
shut
our
ports
to
the
vessels
of
friendly
countries.
the
only
possible
way
that
we
could
deal
with
over
tonnaging
is
by
telling
the
american
flag
vessels
that
they
should
stop
serving
this
american
trade
and
that
is
directly
contrary
to
the
primary
objective
of
shipping
act
1916
and
merchant
marine
act
1936.
the
next
problem
where
the
international
phase
comes
in
is
the
matter
of
rate
fixing.
we
cannot
fix
rates
by
government
edict
in
foreign
commerce
as
we
can
in
interstate
and
domestic
commerce.
let's
assume
an
illustration,
let's
take
the
--
a
case
suppose
our
federal
maritime
board
would
say
that
the
minimum
rate
on
goods,
on
chinaware
should
be
$30.
and
suppose
the
japanese
government
would
say
that
the
maximum
rate
should
be
$25.
by
then
there
is
only
one
way
that
you
could
possibly
dispose
of
that
sort
of
an
argument
and
that
is
by
arising
to
the
diplomatic
level
and
having
our
consuls
or
diplomats
get
together
to
decide
what
rates
should
be
charged
in
the
carriage
of
goods
from
japan
to
united
states.
now
in
all
other
countries,
in
all
other
countries,
this
problem
has
been
dealt
with
by
the
meeting
together
of
the
ship
owners
and
determining
what
the
rates
should
be.
in
all
countries
except
japan,
which
moved
along
our
lines
under
the
american
post
war
influence,
those
conferences
are
without
regulation.
and
the
countries,
the
governments
depend
for
the
protection
of
the
shippers
on
the
enlightened
self
interest
of
the
carriers
because
they
know
that
if
they
charge
rates
which
will
put
the
japanese
merchant
out
of
business
here,
that
the
german
merchant
will
get
the
business
and
our
vessels
will
carry
even
less
cargo.
our
answer,
our
answer
to
that
problem
is
the,
is
the
matter
that
engaged
the
attention
of
the
alexander
committee
back
in
1912.
and
they
came
up
with
the
answer
that
we
cannot,
we
cannot
outlaw
conferences
because
if
you
do
--
you
are
not
alone
going
to
have
non-conference
competition
of
one
against
all
but
every
--
every
carrier
is
going
to
be
at
the
throat
of
every
other
carrier.
and
the
committee
said
that
they
were
convinced
that
in
such
a
situation
they
--
that
the
large
carriers
would
survive
and
the
smaller
ones
would
be
driven
out
of
business.
whenever
you
have
such
a
situation
prevailing
in
a
public
service
field,
it's
always
the
small
man
in
business
who
gets
the
worst
of
it
and
the
big
man
who
can
hold
out
in
this
bargaining
field
who
can
get
the
best
rates.
and
that
is
the
testimony
before
the
alexander
committee
that
the,
that
where
there
was
open
competition,
it
was
in
the
interests
of
the
big
and
contrary
to
the
interest
of
the
small
carriers.
now
i
would
like
to
go
with
your
honors
for
just
a
second
on
this
section
14
third
which
was
the,
the
statutory
enactment
that
caused
us
the
trouble
in
the
court
of
appeals.
as
mr.
gardner
said
that
he
didn't
think
that
there
was
any
other
evidence
in
the
statute
as
to
what
might
possibly
be
the
kinds
of
physical
common
carrier
facilities
which
might
be
denied
by
way
of
retaliation,
but
i
think
that
if
we
will
drop
down
to
the
next
section
which
is
section
14
fourth,
and
which
does
not
setup
a
per
se
violation
but
only
a
discretionary
violation,
it
says,
“make
any
unfair
or
--”
this
is
on
page
2a
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
i
think
it's
the
easiest
way
to
find
it,
2a.
it
says
“make
any
unfair
or
unjustly
discriminatory
contract
with
any
shipper
based
on
the
volume
of
traffic
offered
or
unfairly
treat
or
unjustly
discriminate
against
any
shipper
in
the
matter
of
a)
cargo
space
accommodations
when
the
same
are
available,”
there
we
find
the
same
language
as
we
had
in
subdivision
3rd
due
regard
being
had
for
the
proper
loading
of
the
vessel,
“b)
the
loading
and
landing
of
freight
in
proper
condition,
and
c)
the
adjustment
and
settlement
of
claims.”
now
there
we
have
two
illustrations,
they
certainly
are
not
all
inclusive
but
there
are
two
illustrations
of
cases
in
which
a
carrier
could,
retaliate
against
a
shipper
in
matters
other
than
rate
discrimination.
and
may
i
say
this,
your
honors
that
mr.
o'connor
in
his
brief
has
cited
a
case,
the
alaska
steamship
company
case
and
i
don't
think
it's
got
too
much
to
do
with
this
case,
this
situation,
but
it
does
have
a
great
value
on
this
point,
it
is
a
perfect
catalog
of
ways
in
which
a
shipper
can
retaliate
against
a
carrier,
i
am
sorry,
a
carrier
can
retaliate
against
a
shipper
in
matters
that
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
rate
matters,
a
rate
adjustment.
now
it's
our
position
if
the
court
please
that
even
if,
even
if
section
14
third
should
be
read
as
the
court
below
read
it
so
that
it
would
condemn
retaliation
because
a
shipper
had
entered
into
a
freight
contract
it
still
would
not
justify
any
holding
that
the
dual
rate
system
is
illegal
per
se.
and
that
is
true
for
this
very
simple
reason
that
whenever
anybody
enters
into
any
kind
of
a
contract,
the
man
who
contracts
obtains
an
advantage
for
which
he
bargained.
the
man
who
doesn't
contract
does
not
obtain
the
advantage,
question
retaliation,
ordinarily
not,
because
that
may
have
horses
to
sell
and
the
man
who
buys
them
and
pays
the
price
gets
the
horses,
and
the
man
who
doesn't,
isn't
retaliated
against.
when
you
come
to
the
situation
of
a,
an
exclusive
patronage
contract
then
you
might
have
a
closer
question
and
i
think
there
motivation
will
enter
in.
if
the
carriers
here
had
in
mind
the
punishment
of
some
carrier,
some
shippers
who
had
been
patronizing
outside
lines
in
a
--
some
penal
manner
i
would
say
then
yes.
in
fact
you
have
retaliation.
in
our
case
our
good
friends
specifically
asked
the
board
to
make
a
finding
that
there
was
retaliation.
and
there
was
a
factual
finding
that
there
was
no
retaliation.
and
not
only
did
the
board
refuse
to
find
retaliation
but
they
actually
found
that
there
were
good
business
reasons,
reasons
in
our
own
self
interest
whereby
we
would
put
this
system
into
effect,
and
why?
because
as
against
the
cut
rate
independent
competition
it
would
enable
us
to
get
for
our
15
lines
who
are
directly
in
this
trade
approximately
6.5%
of
the
business
on
the
average
among
them.
it
wouldn't
work
out
that
way
evenly
because
as
i
said
there
are
strokes
whereas
the
court
found,
i
am
sorry
the
board
found
that
is
isbrandtsen
would
retain
at
least
10%.
now
i
would
like
next
to
consider
in
the
very
few
minutes
that
i
have
before
me,
have
before
me,
some
of
the
cases
that
are
decided
in
this
court
and
which
i
believe
unless
they
are
reversed
require
a
decision
in
our
favor.
and
the
first
one
is
the
united
states
navigation
against
cunard
steamship
company.
in
that
case
--
that
case
came
up
to
this
court
on
a
private
antitrust
--
in
a
private
antitrust
suit
in
which
an
injunction
only
was
added,
it
was
requested
no
damages.
in
that
case
a
dual
rate
system
was
alleged.
as
contrasted
with
our
--
mr.
elkan
turk
alright,
as
contrasted
with
our
9.5%
spread,
the
complaint
alleged
that
there
was
as
high
as
100%
spread
between
the
contract
and
non-contract
rates.
i
wish
that
i
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
this,
but
my
time
is
up.
