e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
you
said
you
had

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice

e.
whittaker
you
admit
that
you
did
have
a
place
of
business
in
alabama?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
admit
that
--
therein
that
you're
doing
business
in
alabama?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
which
to
comply.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
on
the
30th,
you
did
tender
all
the
materials
required
by
the

(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
mostly
denied
on
the
next
day,
the
31st
of
july.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
same
--
same
date?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
july
30?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
a
civil
contempt
order
that
is
purgeable
or
is
this
an
outright
fine
as
to
a
criminal
contempt?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
sorry
if
i
interrupt
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
i
might
find
out
the
answer
to
this
(inaudible).
do
you
claim
that
it
was
not
within
the
power
of
the
trial
court
in
sustaining
this
motion
to
produce,
to
require
you
to
give
the
names
and
the
addresses
of
your
members,
not
within
his
power?
was
that
relevant
in
other
words
to
the
lawsuit
pending
before
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
you
were
doing
business
there
and
within
the
power
of
the
trial
court
so
to
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
i
think
so.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
wanted
to
file
the
--
pay
the
charges,
the
fees,
registration
fees
and
so
forth
at
the
same
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
you
don't
argue
mr.
carter
that
failure
to
enforce
the
law
for
a
period
stops
the
sovereign
from
enforcement
later.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
--
do
you
--
is
it
--
did
the
alabama
trial
court
have
legal
authority
to
impose
under
the
law
of
alabama
some
penalty
of
whatsoever
kind
for
the
failure
to
comply
within
the
time
prescribed
with
an
order
to
produce?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
the
trial
court
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
yes,
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
sorry
to
ask
you
some
more
questions.
do
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
to
justice
frankfurter
that
you're
complaining
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
as
well
as
the
finding
of
the
contempt
in
which
here
is
defined?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
i'm
asking
you
how
you
get
the
temporary
injunction
if
there
is
no
temporary
restraining
order
--
temporary
injunction
as
i
understood
(inaudible)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
district
court
or
the
trial
court
except
by
a
motion
to
dissolve
which
was
never
heard
and
that
all
(inaudible)
was
issued
upon
and
probably
were
not,
then
you
will
properly
cite
the
contempt
to
fine.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rinehart,
how
in
alabama
do
you
raise
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
preliminary
injunction
was
legally
or
illegally
entered?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
what
i
thought.
now,
until
the
motion
to
resolve
has
been
heard,
you
have
--
you're
not
out
of
the
trial
court
and
there
is
nothing
yet
to
review.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
have
two
aspects
here,
one
is
the
temporary
injunction
but
as
a
collateral
appendix
to
the
determination
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
injunction
might
be
maintained.
an
argument
was
entered
by
the
trial
court
for
the
production
of
certain
documents.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
law
of
alabama,
does
the
court
have
an
inherent
or
a
statutory
power
to
impose
penalty
for
disobedience
of
his
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
what's
the
remedy
--
that's
final
when
the
penalty
is
assessed,
isn't
it?
that's
--
that's
immediately
reviewable
whether
by
appeal,
certiorari,
mandamus
or
whatnot,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
how
do
you
get
a
review
on
that
issue,
you
say
by
mandamus,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
to
test
only
the
conviction
for
contempt
for
disobedience
to
the
order
to
produce,
that's
what
you
mean
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
in
missouri,
you
would
have
to
do
this
not
by
mandamus
but
by
a
prohibition.
now,
but
in
your
state,
you
do
it
by
mandamus.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
let's
go
back
to
the
injunction
feature,
the
temporary
injunction.how
is
that
reviewed
after
the
motion
for
--
to
dissolve
has
been
overruled?
how
do
you
review
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
a
direct
appeal.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
relation
to
the
injunction
feature?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
know
mr.
carter
that
the
court's
order
of
requiring
such
and
that
order
stands
until
vacated
by
some
procedure
which
alabama
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
whether
the
--
until
it's
at
least
raised
in
some
way
which
the
alabama
law
specifies.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
i
know
--
first
thing
i
know.
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
order
to
produce.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
this
is
the
same
thing
too
on
the
temporary
restraining
order.
there,
it
was
--
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
power
to
handle
it,
the
trial
court
whether
it's
right
or
wrong.
now,
until
a
motion
to
dissolve,
it
has
been
denied
(inaudible)
that
court,
no
way
to
go
--
any
place
else
and
--
isn't
that
right?and
therefore
you
haven't
--
can't
have
a
review
of
that
temporary
injunction
until
you
have
had
an
order
of
willing
the
motion
to
dissolve.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
thing
that
you
say
barred
you
from
alabama
was
the
temporary
injunction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
--
is
that
before
us,
can
there
be
a
review
of
the
evidence
and
to
point
out
until
a
motion
to
dissolve
it
has
been
presented
and
denied.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
issuing
the
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
jurisdiction
in
the
court
at
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
think
that
it
naturally
follows
if
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
then
everything
it
did
was
of
nullity.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
am
i
right,
no
jurisdiction?
