mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please.
this
calls
us
here
from
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
dismissing
and
denying
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
filed
by
petitioner
seeking
to
review
in
the
alabama
court
an
adjudication
of
contempt
and
a
fine
in
the
sum
of
$100,000
on
the
failure
of
petitioner
to
submit
its
membership
lists
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county.
the
issues
arose
in
the
following
manner.
on
june
1,
1956,
the
attorney
general
filed
the
bill
of
complaint
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county,
alleging
that
petitioner
was
doing
business
in
alabama
without
complying
with
the
foreign
registration
act
of
alabama.
and
alleging,
in
addition,
various
of
illegal
acts,
the
--
the
two
that
they've
named
was
the
fact
that
the
allegation
was
that
petitioner
had
given
moneys
to
two
persons
to
induce
them
to
apply
to
the
university
of
alabama
to
test
these
policies
excluding
negroes
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we're
incorporated
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
under
the
new
york
membership
(inaudible)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
new
york
membership.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
membership
corporations
act.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
charged
that
we
have
failed
to
register
as
a
foreign
corporation
that
we
were
doing
business
in
alabama
without
first
complying
with
this
act
which
requires
foreign
corporations
to
submit
their
articles
in
a
corporation
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
designate
a
place
of
business,
but
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
precisely.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
in
addition
to
this
failure,
they
charge
that
we
have
done
other
illegal
acts.
and
as
i
started
to
indicate,
the
acts
that
they're
charge
were
that
we've
given
money
--
alleged
that
we've
given
money
to
two
persons
to
induce
them
to
enroll
at
the
university
of
alabama
to
test
this
policy
that
we
had
furnished
counsel
for
these
persons
and
that
we
had
incited
and
aided
the
montgomery
citizens
to
boycott
the
bus
lines
when
they
were
attempting
to
secure
unsegregated
(inaudible).
on
the
basis
of
these
allegations
alone
and
without
a
hearing
and
with
nothing
further,
we
were
without
notice,
enjoined
from
operation.
the
--
the
state
asked
that
we'd
be
enjoined
from
all
organizational
activities.
we
were
so
enjoined
ex
parte
and
in
addition
although
this
was
not
requested
by
the
state,
the
court
enjoined
us
from
taking
any
steps
to
comply
with
the
law
of
requiring
foreign
corporations
to
domesticate.
now,
we
then
filed
on
july
2nd
a
motion
to
vacate
to
dissolve
the
--
the
injunction
of
temporary
decree,
which
is
the
procedure
that
one
follows
an
alabama
law.
on
july
5th,
the
state
came
with
a
motion
requiring
us
to
produce
pretrial
production
of
various
doctrines,
including
a
list
of
our
members
and
various
other
items.
this
motion
was
heard
on
july
9
and
on
july
9
towards
july
11,
the
court
ordered
us
to
produce
these
various
items
including
a
list
of
our
members
and
we've
cited
the
--
the
specific
things
that
the
court
asked
that
are
cited
on
pages
6,
7,
and
8
of
our
petition
filed
here.
the
court
asked
that
these
or
these
items
be
produced
on
july
16,
but
it
subsequently
extended
the
time
for
us
to
produce
until
july
25th
and
then
simultaneously
continued
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
to
july
25th.
we
then
filed
an
answer
on
july
23rd
in
which
we
admitted
that
we
had
--
that
we
were
--
had
charted
branches
in
the
state
that
we
had
been
in
alabama
since
1918,
that
we
had
not
registered
under
the
--
under
the
act
because
it
was
our
good
faith
belief
that
we
were
not
required
to
do
so
that
we
had
not
furnished
any
moneys
to
anybody
to
enroll
in
the
university
of
alabama
although
we
did
admit
that
we've
furnished
legal
counsel
and
aide
to
ms.
lucy
to
prosecute
our
suit,
but
we
have
not
participated
in
the
montgomery
situation,
but
that
we
had
given
financial
assistance
and
legal
aide
to
the
persons
who
were
charged
with
--
with
violations
of
the
state
law
from
refusing
to
ride
the
buses
unsegregated.
we
are
--
in
our
answer,
we
said
that
although
we
do
not
feel
that
we
are
obliged
to
abide
this
law,
we
attached
the
--
the
requisite
form
and
asked
the
court
to
resend
its
order
and
vacate
its
order,
barring
us
from
registry
so
that
we
could
comply
with
the
law.
in
other
words,
we
indicate
that
we're
willing
to
wait
whatever
contentions
we
had
on
that
ground.
with
this
answer,
we
filed
the
motion
to
vacate
the
interlocutory
order
of
the
court
requiring
us
to
produce
on
constitutional
ground
and
on
the
ground
that
the
issue
was
no
longer
--
the
issue
of
the
--
getting
all
these
documents
was
no
longer
an
issue
because
of
the
fact
that
we
had
made
a
full
answer
and
this
was
a
legal
question
in
terms
of
whether
we
were
or
we're
not
doing
business.
but
on
our
refusal
to
--
the
court
refused
to
grant
this
motion
and
on
our
refusal
to
give
all
the
names
of
our
members,
the
court
adjudged
us
in
contempt
and
find
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
not
yet,
your
honor.
we
didn't
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
we
not
only
expressed
readiness,
we
had
secured
the
forms
and
attached
them
to
our
--
to
our
answer.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
we
have.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
the
only
thing
that
the
form
requires
them,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
you
file
your
articles
of
incorporation
which
incidentally
the
state
already
had.
they
were
attached
to
the
complaint
which
was
filed
by
the
attorney
general
and
that
you
designate
your
place
of
business
which
the
state
knew
because
it's
so
designated
in
the
bill
of
complaint
and
indicating
agent
for
service,
these
things
we
do.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
we
understand
the
law.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
secured
them
from
the
--
from
the
secretary
of
state
and
attached
them
to
our
answer
and
indicating
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
filled
them
out.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
we
have
a
southeast
regional
office
in
birmingham
which
was
maintained
by
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
are
contesting
as
i
attempt
to
make
it,
your
honor.
our
contention
was
that
we
do
not
think
that
we
are
doing
business
in
alabama.
we
do
not
think
that
we're
doing
business
in
alabama
and
we
do
not
think
that
this
law
applies,
but
we
were
willing
to
waive
and
comply
with
the
law
and
therefore
we
proceeded
to
attempt
to
domestic.
now,
we've
indicated
that
we
would
file
these
forms
if
the
court
would
permit
as
to
do.
the
court
had
indicated
that
we
could
not
even
make
any
attempts
to
write
this.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
was
the
--
the
form
was
filled
out
by
the
--
by
the
organization.
i
think
it
has
to
be
signed
by
the
president.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
appears
the
name
of
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
person,
i
believe.
now,
i
can't
be
sure
of
this
but
let
me
say
this
that
whatever
was
required
in
terms
of
the
form,
we
did
it
and
i
--
i'm
not
really
clear
as
to
whether
or
not
the
name
appear
by
--
as
i
remember.
the
--
the
name
of
the
president
of
the
corporation
has
to
be
signed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
as
i
indicated,
when
we
continued
to
--
to
refuse,
to
divulge
the
names
of
our
members
pursuant
to
our
--
we
were
fined,
adjudged
in
contempt
and
fined
$10,000
with
a
proviso
that
we
did
not
comply
within
five
days
and
the
fine
would
be
$100,000.
now,
on
july
20
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
we
have
cited
the
order
of
--
of
the
judge,
if
the
court
pleases,
in
the
record.
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
judge
indicates
before
the
--
our
refusal
to
submit
the
names
as
of
july
25.
we
were
fined
$10,000
and
adjudged
in
contempt.
if
we
did
not
comply
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
now,
this
is
cited
as
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
were
cited
at
page
13
on
--
of
the
--
at
the
appendix
13
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
on
july
30
which
is
four
days
afterwards,
we
came
into
the
trial
court
with
a
motion
to
vacate,
stay
or
set
aside
the
court's
contempt
order.
and
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
burton,
we
tendered
compliance
with
the
order
of
the
court
with
the
exception
of
the
--
the
prior
portion
of
the
order
requiring
us
to
give
the
names
and
addresses
of
our
members
and
a
portion
of
the
order
which
asked
us
to
submit
all
of
our
files,
all
of
our
letters,
all
of
our
correspondents
and
so
forth
which
we
contended
was
burdensome
and
would
completely
disrupt
our
operation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir
and
i
--
as
i
indicated
in
that
item,
all
of
which
required
us
to
submit
all
of
our
files
and
so
forth,
which
we
could
properly
--
we
could
not
comply
with
and
we
indicated
that
into
the
court.
this
was
just
physically
impossible
for
us
to
do
and
we
so
said
--
said
this
in
our
--
in
our
motion.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
that
was
denied
on
july
30.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
the
--
temporary
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
temporary
restraining
order
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
restrained
us
from
doing
business
and
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
from
doing
any
business,
from
soliciting,
from
maintaining
any
chapters
and
holding
any
meetings
in
alabama
and
from
carrying
on
any
activities
in
alabama.
that
would
be
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
never
came
on
for
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
did
--
we
obeyed
the
order
that
is
that
we
notified
our
affiliates
that
the
order
was
enforced
and
we
had
no
meetings
and
we
did
nothing
to
disobey
the
order.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
--
the
restraining
order
is
still
in
effect.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir,
because
--
because
of
the
fact
that
we
--
because
we
are
in
contempt
under
alabama
law,
we
have
no
right
to
proceed
on
the
merits
of
the
restraining
order.
our
motion
to
dissolve
was
never
heard
so
that
the
restraining
order
has
been
in
effect,
ex
parte
since
june
1st,
1956.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
--
that's
the
situation
precisely.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
provision
with
respect
to
the
--
the
state
has
made
no
effort
to
collect
the
fund.
we
don't
have
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
we
have
no
funds
in
alabama
and
there
are
some
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
under
the
conflict
rules
of
alabama
could
collect
the
--
the
money,
but
i
think
that
alabama
has
accomplished
its
purpose
which
was
to
get
at
that
business
and
put
us
out
of
alabama
and
the
state
has
not
proceeded
to
file
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
when
we
filed
that
motion
to
dissolve
on
july
the
2nd,
it
was
set
down
for
hearing
on
july
17th.
on
july
5,
the
state
comes
in
and
says
for
us
to
disclose
our
members.
on
july
9,
that
was
heard
and
granted.
when
we
refused
to
the
hearing
on
these
objections
and
so
forth,
the
court
continued
the
hearing
that
the
--
time
for
us
comply
and
then
continue
the
hearing
on
a
motion
to
dissolve
so
it
would
be
behind
the
hearing
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
were
to
comply
with
the
order.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
that
was
--
that's
the
--
the
exact
result
of
what's
going
on.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
apparently
so,
your
honor,
because
it
may
well
be
that
if
we
would
have
paid
the
$100,000
that
we
would
be
considered
purge
of
contempt,
but
then
we
will
be
ordered
to
comply
with
the
order
and
we
could
be
found
in
contempt
again
until
the
whole
thing
would
go
on.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
the
discovery.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir,
the
discovery
order,
the
interlocutory.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
that
its
civil
contempt.
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
supreme
court
has
held
--
of
alabama
has
held
that
it's
--
it's
a
civil
contempt.
if
it
were
a
criminal
contempt,
the
fine
could
have
--
could
only
be
$50
so
that
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
it's
--
we
contend
it
under
the
law
of
alabama
that
--
and
some
of
the
cases
of
the
supreme
court
that
this
should
be
considered
as
criminal
contempt
and
the
fine
of
$50.
but
in
this
opinion,
the
supreme
court
disagrees
and
holds
that
it
is
civil
contempt.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
on
the
--
with
this
--
on
july
10
that
i
--
that
i
can
recapture
the
sequence
of
event,
this
motion
was
denied.
we
then
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
with
a
motion
to
stay
or
satisfy
the
--
the
order
of
the
lower
court
pending
review
on
certiorari,
pending
the
filing
or
disposition
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
i
am
not
clear.
i
think
it
was
technically
that
we
had
failed
to
put
in
the
petition,
certain
allegations
which
we
have
set
forth
fully
in
our
brief,
but
they
held
that
we
hadn't
technically
complied
with
their
rules.
now,
in
its
opinion
on
december
6,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
refused
to
grant
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
ground
that
if
we
had
desire
to
seek
a
review
on
the
merits
of
the
order
to
disclose,
the
interlocutory
order
to
disclose,
that
the
proper
method
for
us
to
sought
such
a
review
was
by
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.
that
on
certiorari,
adjudications
of
contempt
on
certiorari
that
the
court
is
concerned
only
to
jurisdictional
matter
that
it
has
to
find
that
the
order
is
void
on
its
face
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
or
that
contempt
was
not
in
fact
committed
or
that
the
citation
was
in
someway
insufficient.
and
the
court
found
jurisdictionally
and
so
forth
that
this
case
met
all
these
requirements
and
therefore
that
the
circuit
court
had
the
authority
to
find
us
in
contempt
in
a
jurisdiction
and
then
in
addition,
but
even
though
it
said
we
don't
have
to,
the
court
went
to
the
merits
of
the
order
and
held
that
on
the
merits,
the
court
below
had
the
authority
to
issue
the
order
itself.
now,
we
are
--
we
therefore
feel
that
the
very
outside
of
these
proceedings
were
met
with
the
question
of
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
and
we
think
that
it
unquestionably
had.
we
--
we
take
that
position
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
under
the
authority
of
rogers
versus
alabama.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
on
to
--
to
raise
the
issues
that
we
won't
raise.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no.
the
court
--
well,
i've
tend
to
take
the
position
that
that's
what
happened,
but
the
--
but
to
no
offense
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
all
honesty
so
far
as
this
decision
was
concerned,
it
said
that
although
we
don't
have
to
go
for
it
and
we
can
stop
after
we
find
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
--
and
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
think
so.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
court
said
that
we
don't
have
to
do
anything
further,
but
it
went
on
and
said
that
on
the
merits
of
the
order,
the
order
is
valid
and
should
be
sustained.
we
think
in
--
in
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
we
think
that
in
effect,
the
court
indicated
that
if
we
had
come
upon
that
damage,
it
would
have
sustained
the
order
on
the
merits,
but
that's
the
substance
of
the
opinion.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
i
--
the
reason
i
say,
“no,
sir”
is
because
if
i
remember
a
decision
of
this
court
in
thomas
versus
collins
where
this
same
kind
of
thing
was
done,
i
think
that
this
court
said
that
even
though
the
court
indicated
that
it
did
not
have
to
go
into
the
merits,
since
it
did
go
into
the
merits,
the
issue
was
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
well,
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
as
we
indicated
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
we
think
that
what
alabama
has
done
is
to
seek
here
too
unfairly,
to
seek
our
right
to
have
this
--
this
case
reviewed
for
federal
rights
which
we
think
are
here
under
the
guides
of
local
practice.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
think
so
although,
mr.
justice
burton.
there
are
some
decisions
in
alabama
where
a
person
has
come
up
to
the
supreme
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
or
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
and
the
court
said,
“you've
taken
the
wrong
proceeding,
but
we
will
treat
it
as
a
--
as
the
proper
proceeding
as
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.”
they
did
not
do
it
here
so
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
--
there
is
a
case
and
the
only
case
i
know
of
quite
frankly
which
was
decided
where
--
in
which
a
--
an
alabama
--
i
think
it
was
in
(inaudible),
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.
the
court
held
that
this
should
have
been
from
contempt
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
but
since
you've
asked
for
such
further
relief,
we're
going
to
grant
--
we're
going
to
treat
it
as
a
petition,
as
a
proper
petition
and
i
--
i
think
i
can
cite
that
case
for
you
to.
it
is
armstrong
versus
green
which
is
cited
at
60
s.
2d
834.
we
do
not
cite
it
in
our
brief.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there's
no
question.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
our
--
that's
our
position
that
--
that
under
alabama
law,
the
--
the
same
kind
of
questions
that
we
have
here
which
go
to
the
validity
of
the
order,
disobedience
of
which
led
to
the
citation
of
contempt
and
which
raised
constitutional
questions
involved,
alabama
has
decided
those
cases
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
contempt.
and
in
fact,
we
go
further
insofar
as
we
understood
alabama
law,
this
was
the
customary
way
in
which
issues
of
this
kind
were
raised
and
treated.
and,
so
that
we
think
that
under
the
--
we've
decided
the
case
which
we
think
are
in
point
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
alabama
law
and
we
think
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
now,
before
i
go
into
the
argument
of
the
merits,
i
think
it's
best
for
me
to
try
to
recapitulate
what
i
think
are
the
orders
which
are
before
the
court
and
before
this
court
which
we
ought
to
review.
we
think
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
which
barred
us
from
all
activities
and
in
fact
ousted
us
from
the
state,
and
barred
us
in
complying
with
the
law,
the
interlocutory
order
requiring
us,
among
other
things,
to
disclose
the
identification
and
the
addresses
of
our
members.
the
first
adjudication
of
contempt
and
the
fine
of
$10,000
which
was
entered
on
july
25,
the
second
adjudication
of
contempt
in
the
fine
of
$100,000
which
was
issued
on
july
31,
and
the
order
and
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
denying
the
petition
--
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
this
is
the
--
i
--
i
meant
that
when
i
said
that
the
order
and
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
--
in
this
case,
that's
the
opinion
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
yes,
that
--
that
opinion
is
--
is
here
on
(inaudible)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
think
that
the
rest
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
think
that
the
rest
is
here
and
i
--
if
i'm
--
i
would
--
if
permitted,
i
would
like
to
indicate
how
in
a
moment.
it's
our
contention
that
the
entire
proceedings
in
alabama
are
void
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
alabama
authorities
had
no
--
no
authority
and
no
power
and
no
--
to
oust
us
from
the
state.
that
we
have
been
deprived
the
right
to
carry
on
our
lawful
--
lawful
activities
pursuant
to
a
temporary
restraining
order,
the
order
to
disclose
the
list
of
our
members
and
it
is
contempt
to
adjudications.
we
contend
that
the
order
requiring
us
to
disclose
the
list
of
our
members
is
a
denial
of
our
right,
the
right
of
the
corporation
and
the
right
of
its
members
to
free
speech
and
freedom
of
association
and
as
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
contend
that
if
we
have
disclosed
the
list
of
our
members,
they
would
have
been
subjected
to
possible
harm,
threats,
and
fears.we
further
contend
that
the
punishment
for
contempt
and
the
fines
issued
was
so
vindictive
that
they
in
and
of
themselves,
an
excess
--
that
in
and
of
itself
constitute
as
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
that
the
atmosphere
in
alabama
which
was
one
of
open
hostility
to
our
organization
and
--
and
its
members
that
this
has
so
insinuated
itself
into
the
proceedings
in
the
court
that
we
think
that
the
whole
proceedings
below
was
in
fact
a
perversion
of
the
judicial
process.
now,
with
respect
to
the
free
speech
contentions,
it's
our
view
that
as
an
organization
whose
purpose
is
to
seek
to
improve
the
status
of
negroes
in
america
and
to
remove
color
discrimination,
that
we
are
to
pursue
this
objective
in
a
lawful
manner,
and
that
we
are
entitled,
and
our
members
are
entitled
to
associate
together
to
pursue
this
objective
and
that
we
have
the
protection
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
so
doing.
now,
it
is
true
that
under
the
present
status
of
affairs
in
alabama
that
at
the
present
time,
our
aims
are
at
bearings
with
the
--
with
state
policy,
but
the
aims
of
--
and
the
objectives
of
the
organization
which
are
to
remove
racial
and
color
discrimination
from
american
life
are
in
accord
with
the
--
with
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
guaranteed
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
although
alabama
in
a
desire
to
maintain
segregation
and
so
forth,
we
think
that
we
have
a
right
to
pursue
our
objectives
of
the
removal
of
segregation,
even
though
it
would
be
a
bearing
with
the
state
policy
and
that
the
state
policy
in
this
regard
has
no
effect
whatever.
now,
insofar
as
our
members
are
concerned
in
the
right
of
the
organization
to
do
this,
it
is
our
belief
that
under
the
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
our
members
in
the
organization
are
entitled
to
pursue
these
objectives
free
and
unsighted
from
any
state
control,
acts
compelling
justification.
we
think
that's
what
the
decision
in
this
court
hold
and
we
think
that
that
has
been
repeated
in
the
two
latest
decisions
that
we
know
of
on
the
subject
decided
last
term,
sweezy
and
watkins.
now,
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
contend
of
course
that
the
state
may
not
control
the
organization
and
may
not
limit
its
activities
in
some
way,
but
we
do
--
we
do
contend
that
whereas
here,
first
amendment
rights
are
being
invaded
that
the
balance
has
to
be
struck
between
the
necessity
for
the
regulation
and
the
freedom
which
has
to
--
which
we
feel
we're
entitled
to
have.
alabama
has
offered
no
justification
whatever
in
any
--
in
any
paper
filed
in
this
case
to
warrant
the
--
the
restraints
issued
or
to
warrant
the
order
with
regard
to
our
members.
there
is
no
necessity,
no
need
that
has
been
shown
as
to
why
this
--
the
attorney
general
desires
to
know
who
our
members
are.
no
purpose
would
be
served
by
it,
in
fact,
what
would
happen
insofar
we
are
concerned
with
this
is
that
the
status
spreading
on
the
ground
which
has
no
right
to
trail.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
surely.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
we
think
it
was
not.
we
think
not
only
was
it
not
relevant.
we
think
that
the
trial
court
had
no
authority
to
order
this
disclosure
because
of
the
fact
that
our
contention
is
that
the
right
of
our
members
to
associate
together
in
the
organization,
to
associate
together
is
--
is
protected
from
enforced
disclosure
to
any
state
authority.this
is
our
contention.
now,
on
the
question
of
relevance,
if
we
think
it
is
not
a
basic
question,
but
on
the
question
of
relevance
in
--
in
the
light
of
our
answer
in
which
we
had
admitted
that
we
had
the
kinds
of
operation
that
we
have
been
carrying
on,
what
we
have
been,
the
character
of
our
--
of
our
operation,
not
only
in
the
alabama
but
throughout
the
united
states,
the
question
of
who
are
members
were
have
nothing
and
no
relevance
whatever
to
the
--
the
question
which
was
purportedly
before
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
we
were
doing
business.
and
besides
that,
when
we
offered
to
register
and
offered
to
waive
our
right
to
object
to
alabama
saying
whether
we
were
or
we're
not
doing
business,
if
there
had
been
any
relevance,
we
submit
that
it
was
lost
at
that
point.
there
was
no
issue
before
the
court
from
which
the
--
the
identification
of
our
members
had
any
relevance
whatever.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
it's
our
--
our
theory
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
order
to
disclose
was
in
order
that
the
alabama
court
and
the
--
the
attorney
general
was
in
fact
seeking
to
use
this
so
that
we
would
be
placed
with
two
which
we
consider
unconstitutional
conditions.
either
we
have
to
comply
with
the
order
to
disclose
and
therefore,
submit
to
a
violation
of
our
right
of
free
speech
and
right
of
free
association,
or
we
risk
content
and
we
are
ousted
from
the
state
as
we
were
and
never
get
an
opportunity
to
test
the
merits
of
the
order.
now,
in
our
view,
the
--
the
respondents
have
sought
to
utilize
the
subversion
cases
and
the
bryant
versus
zimmerman
which
we
think
have
no
relevance
whatsoever
in
this
case.
we're
not
--
we're
not
subversive.
there
is
no
allegation
that
we
were
subversive.
there
is
no
allegation
in
fact
in
the
pleadings
that
--
that
we
have
done
anything
illegal
other
than
that
we
have
been
in
alabama
according
to
the
state's
complaint
without
registering.
and
we
think
that
these
cases
have
no
purpose
here
because
in
those
cases
where
the
court
felt
that
the
state
might
require
or
the
federal
government
might
require
some
invasion
of
free
speech
that
in
those
instances,
the
court
found
that
there
was
some
justification
for
it
which
we
contend
the
court
cannot
find
in
this
particular
case.
we
feel
that
the
--
and
we
think
that
the
record
shows
that
alabama
was
using
its
foreign
corporations
registration
act
in
this
proceeding
as
a
cloak
to
require
conformance
in
the
state
on
this
issue
of
segregation
as
--
as
oppose
to
anti-segregation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
don't
think
it
is
an
issue
any
longer,
but
we
don't
think
it
is
in
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
don't
think
so.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
we
offer
to
comply
insofar
as
the
law
is
concerned.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir..
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so.
i
--
i
think
that
in
alabama
--
all
alabama
requires
for
persons
to
domesticate
are
that
they
file
their
articles
of
a
corporation
which
lists
the
persons
that
are
incorporated
and
i
--
and
i
believe
the
members
of
the
board
of
directors
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
we
--
we
don't
--
we
offered
to
--
to
comply
and
the
reason
i
--
i
think
that
all
of
this
is,
even
if
we
take
the
position
and
concede
that
alabama
had
the
right
to
request
us
to
do
that,
we
think
that
they
have
no
authority
to
--
to
use
this
as
a
jumping
off
ground
to
do
the
things
that
it
had
started
and
we
say
this
for
this
reason.
the
--
the
law
in
alabama
requiring
foreign
corporations
to
domesticate
is
to
do
precisely
what
you've
indicated.
now,
technically,
admitting
that
we
were
doing
business,
technically
only
were
we
in
violation
because
of
the
fact
that
alabama
knew
our
--
knew
that
we
have
a
southeast
regional
office.
in
fact
of
the
matter
is
their
tax
is
an
exhibit
to
their
complaint.
they
served
the
complaint
on
--
on
us
there.we
submitted
to
the
state's
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
indication
at
all
as
between
1918
and
1956
and
we
have
been
--
had
affiliates
and
had
been
doing
the
same
thing
in
alabama
during
that
period
of
time
that
we
--
in
1918
and
1956,
that
there
was
ever
any
effort
by
any
alabama
citizen
to
sue
the
corporation
which
was
defeated
because
we
had
not
complied.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
we
don't
argue
that
at
all.
we
do
think
that
it
raises
some
presumption
that
this
irreparable
harm
that's
with
no
other
contentions
that
this
irreparable
harm
which
the
state
alleged
did
not
in
fact
takes
place.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
mean
in
order
to
produce
the
names
and
the
address
of
our
members?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
assuming
that
the
order
is
a
valid
order,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
have
the
--
they
would
have
that
now
under
content
if
we
--
if
we
disobeyed
it.
as
i
understand
alabama
law,
if
we
--
as
we
disobey
that
order
as
any
other
order,
we're
contempt
to
court.
and
the
court
has
the
power
to
--
to
enforce
it
by
its
contempt
to
adjudication,
fine
et
cetera,
but
we
don't
think
that
they
--
i
don't
know
of
any
other
power
that
they
had
in
terms
of
this
order
that
you
are
referring
to.
let's
assume
that
it
was
a
valid
order,
but
we
don't
contend
that
it
was
a
valid
order.
i
mean,
that's
our
position.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
--
if
at
any
time
in
the
proceeding,
if
the
court
pleases,
as
i
understand
alabama
law
and
i
think
that
the
attorney
general
concedes
this.
if
--
if
at
anytime
in
the
proceeding,
the
result
of
this
order,
we
are
put
in
contempt
then
the
whole
proceedings
is
aborted,
stopped
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
whatever
has
happened
remains
and
i
would
suspect
that
the
attorney
general
would
then
have
the
right
to
--
to
obtain
a
default
judgment
and
which
will
then
perhaps
make
this
appealable.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
we
say
not
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
so,
we
think
that
the
contempt
itself
is
so
outrageous,
but
now
i
mean
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
a
$100,000
fine.
we
think
that's
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
--
as
i
understood
that,
that
was
the
distinction
that
this
court
made
between
criminal
and
civil
contempt
and
that
we
have
obeyed
the
temporary
restraining
order,
so
that
we
have
not
--
there
is
no
public
defiance
of
the
--
of
the
alabama
court.
we
disobeyed
the
--
the
order
of
--
ordering
us
to
disclose
because
we
thought
that
this
was
the
only
way
that
we
can
preserve
our
rights.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
the
--
we
think
that
the
court
below
has
no
juries
--
that
the
court
in
effect
acted
arbitrarily,
ousted
us
in
alabama.
it
had
no
jurisdiction,
no
authority
to
do
this
under
the
basis
of
this
record.
we
think
further
if
i
--
if
i
may
just
finish.
we
--
we
think
further
that
the
--
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
sustained
the
authority
of
the
court
to
issue
this
temporary
restraining
order,
even
under
the
theory
of
the
contempt
which
it
had
because
it
said
that
they
have
to
be
in
jurisdiction
in
order
for
--
for
--
it
could
have
reviewed
jurisdiction
on
certiorari.
so
the
supreme
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
to
necessarily,
we
thin,
raise
the
issue
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
in
that
court.
it
held
that
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction
to
do
what
it
did.
now,
in
so
doing,
we
contend
that
it
has
to
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
court
had
the
right
to
issue
the
temporary
restraining
order/
otherwise,
it
would
have
to
upheld
that
the
order
to
produce
constant
with
it
was
void.
we
think
that
this
is
very
definitely
before
the
court,
but
not
only
as
the
temporary
--
not
only
as
the
order
to
disclose
in
the
contempt
before
the
court,
but
to
go
back
to
the
initial
thing
that
started
the
temporary
restraining
order
itself.
and
--
and
our
contention
is
that
all
of
these
matters
are
here
and
that
they
should
be
disposed
of
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
black.
i
expressed
some
interest
in
some
of
the
pleadings
which
are
not
here.
as
you
know,
this
was
an
ancillary
proceeding
and
this
was
the
record
which
was
certified
and
printed
from
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
if
the
court
desires
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
--
could
undertake
to
get
the
motions
and
all
the
other
pleadings
if
that's
--
if
that
is
what
is
desired
with
respect
to
the
motion
to
stay
and
the
first
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
bill
of
complaint
filed
by
the
state
and
our
answer.
that's
--
if
the
court
decide
for
me
to
do
that,
i
will
certainly
undertake
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
they
--
we
do
not.
they're
in
--
in
my
office
in
new
york
and
i
could
have
printed
it.
that's
what
the
court
wants
me
to
do.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
the
--
the
ultimate
question
--
the
preliminary
question
rather
of
jurisdiction,
of
course
will
be
decided
by
this
court
on
a
reading
of
the
cases
but
on
the
questions
that
were
asked
to
mr.
rinehart,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
15,
an
excerpt
from
ex
parte
dickens
which
we
set
out
on
page
15
of
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
i
think
shows
without
question
that
on
certiorari
the
court
does
go
using
the
validity
and
the
merits
of
the
order
which
is
disobeyed.
we
think
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
a
reading
of
the
cases
which
you
applied
will
sustain
that
position
except
here.
on
certiorari,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
talks
about
first
amendment
freedoms
--
freedom
from
privilege
of
self-incrimination
and
indicate
that
this
excerpt
says
that
they
will
go
into
the
merits
and
if
they
don't,
these
opinions
are
not
that
we
need
go
no
further.
these
opinions
are
clearly
on
point
but
as
i
said,
the
court
will
read
the
decisions
that
come
to
its
own
conclusions.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
those
are
the
ones
that
we
rely
on.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
the
armstrong
--
the
reason
i
say
that
the
armstrong
case
was
the
--
merely
to
show
that
at
times
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
treated
these
various
papers
file
as
even
though
they
would
call
something
else
that
treated
them
as
the
proper
paper.
in
other
words,
armstrong
could
have
come
up
or
should
have
come
up
to
alabama
instead
on
certiorari.
it
was
to
call
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said,
“we
will
treat
as
a
petition
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
alabama
pleadings,
one
asked
on
these
pleadings
for
such
other
and
further
relief
as
the
court
may
deem
appropriate.
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
that
we
will
treat
this
as
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
crosses
an
entirely
different
question
and
we
merely
raised
this
to
show
that
the
procedure
is
not
as
strict
on
this
issue
as
--
as
the
state
attempts
to
maintain.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
took
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
from
the
interlocutory
or
the
restraining
order
from
the
first
and
second
adjudications
of
contempt.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
has
not
been
repudiated.
that
has
been
the
laws,
we
understood
it
until
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
ex
parte
dickens
was
referred
to
in
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
(inaudible)
beginning
on
page
24
of
the
last
paragraph,
the
court
says
--
of
the
record
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
of
the
record,
yes.
well,
we've
set
out
the
court's
opinion.
the
court
says,
“on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
sole
and
only
reviewable
order
or
decree
is
that
which
adjudged
the
petitioner
to
be
in
contempt.certiorari
cannot
be
made
a
substitute
for
an
appeal
or
other
method
of
review.
certiorari
lies
to
review
an
order
of
judgment
of
contempt
for
the
reason
that
there
is
no
other
method
of
review
citing
ex
parte
dickens.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
--
as
i
understand
the
decision
here,
they
--
the
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
contempt
is
not
the
reach
of
certiorari
but
the
question
of
what
fine
the
court
below
may
impose.
in
criminal
contempt
on
alabama
law,
the
court
is
limited
by
statutes
to
the
amount
of
fine
that
for
an
individual,
they
can
across
toward
an
individual
order
and
across
with
five
days
and
a
fine
of
$50.
on
civil
contempt,
the
court's
power
is
unlimited
to
the
--
to
the
kind
of
punishment
it
may
impose
and
this
was
the
distinction
which
apparently
the
--
which
apparently
to
which
the
court
makes
with
respect
to
this
case.
as
we
read
the
decision
on
ex
parte
dickens
as
referred
to
throughout
the
opinion,
the
court
was
really
misquoting
and
misciting
its
own
decisions
because
ex
parte
dickens
specifically
says
that
certiorari
used
to
be
limited
by
jurisdiction
of
the
questions
of
jurisdiction
but
now
it
could
reach
the
question
of
the
merits.
i
assume
my
time
is
up
but
i
just
wanted
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
thank
you.
well,
our
position
here
in
our
contentions
that
this
is
not
appropriately
a
proceeding
to
require
us
out
to
register.
i
think
that's
clear
from
what
was
said
today
and
it's
clear
from
the
papers
and
what
has
been
--
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
if
the
alabama
wanted
the
corporation
to
register,
we
offered
to
register
and
we
would
have
done
so.
now,
so
this
is
really
not
what
this
case
is
all
about.
we
think
that
alabama,
because
of
the
ideas
which
we
expose
that
alabama
has
sought
to
use
the
far
failure
to
register
which
they
knew
for
a
long
number
of
years
and
which
has
been
very
obvious
in
alabama
for
--
for
many
years,
our
failure
to
register
as
a
--
as
a
device
to
suppress
the
organization
and
to
get
ousters
from
the
state.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
understand
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
but
our
position
is,
if
the
court
please,
that
at
the
very
outset,
the
alabama
court,
the
court
in
this
instance
took
illegal
action
because
the
only
action
that
we
are
aware
of
that
alabama
could
exert
against
the
corporation
for
failure
to
register
was
the
action
which
is
the
statutory
penalties
which
are
set
out
on
our
brief
at
page
35.
so,
we
are
faced
at
the
very
outset,
we're
being
put
out
of
business
without
a
hearing
and
then
being
ordered
as
a
condition
of
--
of
having
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
of
that
--
at
that
point,
we
are
then
required
to
either
submit
to
what
we
consider
unconstitutional
conditions
or
in
effect
stay
ousted
and
have
a
final
judgment
entered
against
us
in
effect
because
we
cannot
prosecute
this
claim
until
the
contempt
proceedings
had
been
finally
adjudicated.
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
our
view
is
that
the
order
requiring
our
members
to
--
requiring
a
production
of
the
names
of
our
members
has
no
relevance
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
are
doing
business
in
the
state
and
particularly
we
believe
this
is
so
since
we
have
taken
that
issue
out
of
the
case
by
ourselves
indicating
to
the
state
that
we
are
willing
to
comply
with
the
law
insofar
as
registration
is
concerned.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
are
you
--
you're
talking
of
the
temporary
restraining
order?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
think
that
that
order
was
put
in
issue,
necessarily
put
in
issue
by
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
indicated
that
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction
that
when
it
went
to
the
question
that
we
contend
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
oust
this
from
the
state
on
the
basis
of
this
pleading
and
that
therefore
the
temporary
restraining
order
is
that
issue
because
we
raised
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
not
only
is
that
alabama
wrong
in
ordering
us
to
produce
the
names
of
our
members
but
we
think
that
at
the
outset,
the
state
court
was
wrong
in
dissolving
in
fact,
barring
us
from
the
state
without
a
hearing
because
our
contention
is
that
there
is
no
authority
under
the
alabama
law
and
on
the
basis
of
this
record
for
this
to
be
done.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
our
theory,
if
the
court
please,
our
theory
is
that
it
is
before
---
properly
before
the
court
because
alabama
acted
arbitrarily
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
that
--
in
issuing
the
temporary
restraining
order
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
our
contention
is
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
alabama
court
to
do
what
the
restrainer
under
the
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
this
record
as
a
bond
corporation
or
our
failure
to
register.
this
is
our
contention
and
that
we
--
and
that
when
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
sustained
jurisdiction
that
it
necessarily
approve
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
this
respect
and
that
is
before
the
court
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
our
view
is
--
that
is
our
view
of
course.
our
view
is
that
they
have
no
right.
that
the
only
thing
that
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
jurisdiction,
that
the
only
power
that
the
alabama
has
upon
the
basis
of
our
failure
to
register
was
to,
one,
require
us
to
register
or
issues
the
