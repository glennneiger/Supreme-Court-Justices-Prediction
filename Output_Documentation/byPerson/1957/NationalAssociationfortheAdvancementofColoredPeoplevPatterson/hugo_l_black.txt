justice
hugo
l.
black
in
alabama,
are
petitions
for
certiorari
ever
treated
as
petitions
for
mandamus
and
decided
on
that
basis
by
the
supreme
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
original
petition
on
the
writ
--
the
contempt
order
was
issued
in
the
record
before
us.
i
did
not
find
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
state's
petition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
their
petition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
printed
that
constitutional
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
say?
what
is
it?
would
you
mind
reading
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
law
of
alabama
which
tells
a
delinquent
corporation
cannot
register
--
cannot
register?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
considering
the
merits,
it
means
that
(inaudible).
you
would
tell
me
what
issue
was
left
upon
which
an
order
could
rest
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
after
you
had,
on
your
petition,
you
oust
these
people
because
they
were
delinquent
after
they
had
offered
to
file
the
secretary's
claims,
a
certificate,
which
if
they
have
been
permitted
to
file,
he
could
not
have
(inaudible).
what
issue
was
left
on
which
orders
could
be
issued
in
your
brief
after
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
they
ever
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
never
had
a
case
where
a
corporation
was
delinquent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
want
to
consume
all
your
time
on
this
but
i
had
been
wondering
if
this
--
is
this
--
if
they
had
been
permitted
to
file
this
registration
certificate
with
the
secretary
of
state.
he
could
not
have
refused
it,
couldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
they
offered
to
file
these
both,
could
he
have
refused
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
basis
for
this
action
originally
except
that
they
were
delinquent
in
registration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
pleadings
are
not
here
that's
the
reason
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
--
on
what
did
you
--
from
what
did
you
take
your
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
unless
at
this
case,
made
a
specific
repudiation
on
what
it
said
in
ex
parte
dickens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
they
head
up
the
question
of
certiorari
as
a
proper
remedy
for
--
to
review
contempt.
the
court
said,
â€œwe
think
that
certiorari
has
a
better
remedy
than
mandamus,
because
the
office
of
a
mandamus
is
to
require
the
lower
court
adjudge
an
act
and
not
to
correct
error
as
the
reverse
--
on
a
reversed
judicial
action.
and
that's
been
referred
to
in
litigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
this
case
referred
to
in
the,
you
say
the
supreme
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
was
said
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
also
referred
to
and
they
distinguished
it
on
the
ground
that
one
would
show
them
on
one
criminal
contempt?
