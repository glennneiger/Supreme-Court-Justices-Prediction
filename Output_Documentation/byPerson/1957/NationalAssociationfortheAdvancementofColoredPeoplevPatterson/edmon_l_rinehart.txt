mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
is
what
i
would
like
to
concern
myself
with
at
the
outset
because
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
case
of
what
this
court
has
to
review.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
deals
with
the
alabama
law
on
certiorari
in
a
limited
review
which
that
application
or
petition
for
that
particular
remedial
writ
is
limited
to,
and
that
is
jurisdiction
of
a
person,
jurisdiction
of
a
subject
matter,
the
regularity
of
the
contempt
proceedings,
for
example,
whether
there
was
a
correct
citation,
whether
there
was
even
a
hearing
on
this
contempt.
all
of
those
things
will
be
looked
at
on
the
face
of
the
record.
that
is
all
that
you
get
by
certiorari
and
that's
all
this
court
looked
at.
it
is
true
and
we
do
not
deny
that
the
court
then
went
on
and
discussed
certain
constitutional
questions,
not
all
of
the
constitutional
questions
which,
mr.
carter
has
discussed
here,
but
certain
of
them,
such
as
the
question
of
a
corporation's
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
whether
a
--
you
can
raise
the
rights
of
persons.
in
other
words,
whether
certain
of
these
rights
are
personal
rights
and
you
may
not
assert
the
right
of
another.
those
things
were
discussed,
but
they
there
were
not
made
the
basis
of
the
decision.
they
said
mandamus
was
the
proper
way
in
which
to
review
the
order
to
produce
and
that
a
review
of
that
order
to
produce
was
not
before
that
court,
and
i
would
like
to
--
now,
enter
on
a
--
i
hope
i'm
not
too
late
with
the
discussion
of
the
common
law
writs
of
mandamus
in
alabama.
it
is
the
established
law
of
alabama
that
the
review
of
interlocutory
order
of
a
court
of
whatever
nature
is
by
writ
of
mandamus,
petition
i
should
say
for
writ
of
mandamus.ex
parte
hart
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
also
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
this
is
--
i'm
reading
now
from
the
record
or
transcript
of
record
at
page
25,
an
order
requiring
defendant
to
produce
evidence
in
a
pending
clause
maybe
reviewed
on
petition
for
mandamus,
ex
parte
hart,
240
ala.
642.
there
is
no
lengthy
discussion
of
the
use
of
mandamus
in
that
opinion.
it
was
merely
assumed
that
that
was
the
proper
way
and
it
has
always
to
my
knowledge
been
the
proper
way
to
review
in
order
to
produce.
for
example,
other
types
of
interlocutory
orders
in
a
pending
criminal
proceeding.
the
state
made
what
amounted
to
a
type
of
motion
to
have
the
defendants
examined
set
to
the
tuscaloosa
hospital
for
mental
examination
to
determine
his
present
sanity
or
his
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
defense.
the
trial
court
refused
to
make
--
to
send
the
defendant
there
as
a
denial
of
certain
constitutional
rights
which
are
not
relevant.
the
law
of
alabama
is
that
when
you
have
an
order
of
that
nature,
fundamental
to
the
future
conduct
of
the
proceedings
that
it
should
be
tested
by
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus,
the
state
in
fact
applied
for
the
writ
and
i
may
also
say
that
it's
still
pending,
not
whether
the
writ
--
whether
it's
a
wrong
remedy,
but
the
question
of
whether
we're
entitled
of
the
writ,
whether
the
order
is
unconstitutional.
now,
the
orderly
--
this
is
one
of
these
springs,
these
traps
for
the
unwary
that
have
been
criticized
at
all.
this
is
a
very
orderly
way
to
proceed
in
these
matters,
every
logical
way
to
proceed
in
these
matters,
because
what
happens
as
in
this
case
on
the
11th
of
july,
there
is
an
order
to
produce
at
a
future
time.
what
is
the
remedy?
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
they
contest
every
single
constitutional
question
concerning
the
justification
of
that
order,
the
questions
of
its
relevancy.
all
of
those
questions
maybe
going
into,
but
this
petitioner
chose
--
didn't
choose
that
path.
he
waited
until
the
11th
hour.
now,
i'm
a
little
ahead
of
myself.
i
should
say
he
waited
until
the
23rd
of
july
and
then
filed
an
answer.
now,
that
answer,
i
must
disagree
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
is
a
rather
odd
type
of
answer
and
then
he
said,
“well,
we
do
maintain
an
office
and
we
do
have
a
couple
of
employees
there.
we
don't
think
we
have
to
register,
but
we
would
be
willing
to
register,”
but
they
never
really
come
out
and
say,
“we're
doing
business
in
alabama.”
and
that
is
an
extremely
important
issue
despite
the
tender
of
compliance
with
the
registration
statute.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
the
statutes
on
that
are
set
out
in
petitioner's
brief
at
page
35.
they
are,
there
is
more
than
that
and
of
course
even
compliance
with
registration
means
that
you
have
--
you
can't
exceed
whatever
powers
you
have.
you
can't
--
you
can't
counter
to
alabama's
laws.
all
of
those
things
involved.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
there
is
a
very
small
filing
fee.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
one
of
the
important
questions
and
the
reason
for
the
relevancy
of
the
document's
requested,
because
the
government
or
the
theory
of
the
state's
case
is
not
merely
--
you
ought
to
do
it
now,
regardless
of
what
you've
done
in
the
past
and
you
can
pay
your
petty
little
fee
here
and
do
this
and
go
and
send
no
more.
we
think
that
the
state
has
–
i
didn't
wish
to
get
on
this,
but
we
think
the
state
has
a
power
to
exclude.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
–
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
as
far
as
--
just
coming
in,
if
when
a
corporation
first
comes
to
alabama
or
decides
they
want
to,
they
come
in
and
they
file
these
papers.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
think
that
they
are
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
have
no
detailed
information
on
that.
we
would
take
the
position
that
they
should
do
that
before
they
start
business.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
can't
answer
that
question
directly.
i
simply
do
not
have
the
--
the
information.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
a
--
a
great
delay,
a
many
years
delay.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
we
are.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
we're
making
that
--
it's
one
of
the
most
important
matters
in
the
case
once
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
whole
merits
of
the
case
are
subject
to
review.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
would
say,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
can
only
speak
of
my
own
knowledge
which
would
at
least
go
back
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
--
go
back
for
several
years,
two
or
three
years
at
a
minimum.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
i
think
in
fact
the
petitioner
admits
that
they
have
taken
certain
activities
for
great
many
years
but
denied
essentially
that
that
was
doing
business
in
alabama.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
sir.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
think
that
would
be
correct
if
we
ever
got
to
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
temporary
restraining
order,
which
i
don't
think
we
ever
do
get
to
really.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
service
of
process.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
--
that
is
the
most
important
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that's
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
there's
a
constitutional
provision
and
it's
not
merely
a
statutory
provision.
and
in
fact,
the
constitutional
provision
is
held
to
be
self-enabling.
and
so,
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
can
look
at
this
and
say
you
have
everything,
though
the
statute
doesn't
say
why
it
is.
i
mean
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
constitutional
provision,
section
232
doesn't
say
what
its
purpose
is
except
to
protect
people
for
this
service
or
process.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
there
is
question
of
franchise
taxes
involved
also
which
they
are
supposed
to,
but
they
--
before
--
to
get
an
exemption
from
certain
taxes,
you
must
establish
the
nature
of
your
corporation,
too.
and
of
course
we're
not
making
a
great
point
of
that
in
this
particular
case.
rather,
we
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
there
is
no
such
statutory
authority.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
there
is
no
case
law
and
no
statutory
law,
either.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
mr.
chief
justice,
just
before
closing
you
asked
me
a
question
concerning
the
alabama
statutes
dealing
with
these
domestication
statutes
and
the
enforcement
thereof.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
there
are
two
criminal
statutes.
they
are
set
out
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
36
in
a
footnote.
they
--
one
of
those
denies
a
foreign
corporation
which
makes
a
contract
in
alabama
the
power
to
assert
their
rights
under
that
contract.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
they
had
also
set
certain
penalties
which
are
misdemeanors
and
those
are
enforced
by
the
solicitors
of
our
respective
circuits
and
counties
and
on
appeals
where
the
attorney
general's
office
would
handle
loss.
those
are
the
only
statutes
in
alabama
which
deal
with
what
we
would
call
the
enforcement,
that
is
the
method
of
penalizing
a
corporation
or
its
agents
for
coming
in
and
doing
business
without
a
license.
we
do
not
place
our
action
or
base
our
action
in
any
way
on
those.
in
fact,
part
of
the
basis
of
our
action
is
that
those
do
not
provide
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
not
a
penalty
but
we
believe
a
power
in
the
court
of
equity
in
its
equity
jurisdiction
to
police,
perhaps
police
is
not
the
correct
word,
to
supervise
corporations
once
it
has
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
in
this
case
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
we
petitioned
not
only
for
temporary
injunction
but
a
permanent
injunction
and
ultimately
an
order
of
ouster
basing
it
on
the
power
of
the
state
to
exclude
a
corporation
completely.
if
we
had
not
in
the
first
place
let
it
in,
we
don't
--
we
actually
concede,
if
we
let
a
corporation
in,
we
allowed
to
qualify,
we
can't
then
turn
around
and
say,
“we're
sorry,
we
just
don't
like
you
anymore.”
or
we
can't
ask
them
to
waive
their
constitutional
rights
in
advance
and
coming
in
as
a
condition
preceding
to
entry.
but
where
they
are
interlopers
as
we
consider
this
corporation
to
be
doing
business
in
alabama
without
even
the
slightest
action
toward
complying
with
our
laws
that
they
are
interlopers
and
that
they
have
absolutely
no
right
to
be
here
and
that
the
equity
power
is
the
only
effective
way
to
protect
and
vindicate
the
constitutional
provision
which
is
involved
here
--
the
constitution
that
is
of
alabama,
section
232.
and
that
the
equity
courts
have
that
power.
and
if
they
have
the
power
to
oust,
they
have
the
lesser
concluded
power
to
restrain
their
qualified
as
a
--
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
think
that
the
records
to
get
to
the
merits
of
this
case
--
no
i
mean
the
merits
before
the
circuit
court
is
so
important
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
be
ousted
in
a
proceeding
of
equity
in
the
nature
of
(inaudible)
such
as
kansas
did
in
state
ex
rel
griffith
against
knights
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
states
petition,
a
sworn
bill,
i
might
add,
a
sworn
bill
in
equity
which
was
filed
on
june
1,
1956.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
if
they
are
doing
business
in
alabama
without
qualifying,
they
cannot
sue
at
our
courts.
that
is
correct.
i
am
--
i
stand
corrected
on
that.
they
may
not
enforce
rights
in
our
court
growing
out
of
that
business
in
alabama.
yes,
a
corporation
may
come
in
and
sue
for
instance
an
insurance
company
in
certain
conditions
and
that
is
not
considered
doing
business
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
and
--
if
that
is
why
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
of
an
extremely
limited
nature.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
just
this,
our
--
we
allege
that
they
are
doing
intrastate
business
in
alabama.
we
--
one
of
the
most
important
phases
of
that
business
and
there
are
others
alleged
which
are
not
admitted
is
that
they
are
soliciting
members.
we
allege
and
believe
a
large
number
of
members.
that
is
a
financial
transaction
conducted
in
alabama
by
agents
of
this
organization
to
support
branches
which
we
alleged
they
control
on
alabama.
and
if
that
is
doing
business
in
alabama
that
we
are
in
the
position
of
proving
that
and
it's
going
--
the
best
way
of
proving
how
a
corporation
operates
that
i
know
of,
is
to
get
their
records
and
look
at
them
and
see
what
they
really
do,
what
their
own
record
show.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no.
they
we're
prepared
to
admit
and
if
i
may,
i
shall
read
from
the

am
now
reading
from

10,
code
of
alabama
1940.
further,
petitioner
denied
11
that
these
acts
are
causing
irreparable
injury
to
the
property
of
civil
rights
of
the
citizens,
residents
and
citizens
of
the
state
of
alabama.
now,
we
do
not
concede
that
that
is
an
admission
of
doing
business
in
alabama.in
fact,
it
is
one
of
those
things
to
say
we're
admitting
we're
doing
a,
b
and
c
but
we
deny
these
other
things
and
when
you
get
all
finished,
your
laws
don't
apply.
now
section
232
was
all
inclusive,
it
says
all
corporations
doing
business
in
alabama,
and
i
could
only
construe
that
to
mean
that
they're
are
saying
that
“while
we
admit
doing
certain
things,
we're
not
doing
business
in
alabama
within
the
meaning
of
your
laws.”
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
you
mean
the
assertion
that
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
various
defenses
to
the
bill
of
complaint,
petitioner,
while
asserting
the
title
10,
sections
192,
193
and
194
of
the
code
of
alabama
1940
was
not
applicable,
had
procured
the
necessary
forms
from
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state,
montgomery,
alabama
and
had
filled
in
the
forms
as
required
by
law
and
offered
to
file
the
same.
said
forms
were
attached
to
his
answer
and
petitioner
stated
that
it
would
file
these
forms
if
the
court
would
dissolve
its
orders
buying
petition
from
registering
and
would
permit
petitioner
to
file
the
forms
attached
to
his
answer.
we
submit
it
does
not
and
for
some
very
definite
reasons.
one,
on
reviewing
the
chronology
of
this
case,
you
will
see
that
petitioner
didn't
file
any
pleadings
until
31
days
after
the
temporary
injunction
of
that,
on
the
fifth
of
july
which
was
three
days
after
and
i
might
add,
that
then
the
trial
judge
set
down
the
hearing
on
a
motion
to
dissolve
a
temporary
injunction
for
the
16th
of
july.
the
state
then
moved
to
produce
--
rather
moved
for
an
order
for
them
to
produce,
which
motion
was
heard
on
the
9th
of
july
which
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
present.
the
case
was
fully
argued
and
presented
on
that
question
purely
of
the
production
and
the
order
was
granted
on
the
11th.
then
their
time
was
extended.
then
the
order
said
produce
on
the
16th
which
was
the
day
before
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
temporary
injunction.
now,
alabama
procedure
is
that
while
oral
testimony
may
not
be
introduced
on
such
a
hearing
as
a
matter
of
right,
you
can
put
it
in
if
it
isn't
objected
to.
but
in
addition,
the
hearing
can
be
on
affidavits
of
both
sides.
we
thought
it's
extremely
important
to
have
those
records
to
sustain
and
(inaudible)
the
allegations
of
the
bill
to
prepare
affidavits,
to
obtain
affidavits.
then
the
trial
judge
extended
their
time
to
produce.he
correspondingly
extended
our
time
for
the
hearing
because
we
needed
those
documents
in
connection
with
the
hearing.
now
then,
at
the
last
hour
or
if
not
the
12th
hour,
at
least
the
11th
hour,
they
come
in
with
an
answer.
now,
we're
not
interested
in
a
corporation
filing
these
papers
if
they
don't
have
to
file
them.if
they
are
exempt,
they
don't
need
to
tender
it.
alabama
isn't
interested
in
a
corporation
not
doing
business
in
alabama,
filing
these
documents.
we
are
not
trying
to
assert
a
right
we
don't
have
but
we
think
we're
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
doing
business
in
alabama
because
our
ultimate
aim
in
this,
admittedly,
i
couldn't
deny
it
on
what
we've
alleged
here,
is
that
we
think
they
are
long-past
record
of
ignoring
our
laws
warranted
something
more
than
a
slap
on
the
wrist
saying,
“well,
now
you
can
pay
it
and
go
and
send
no
more.”
but
we
felt
that
like
kansas,
we
had
a
right
to
oust
them,
completely.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
agree
what
they
offered
to
do
in
alabama.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
accept
everything
except
the
very
last
statement
with
a
reservation
as
being
absolutely
a
correct
statement.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
all
right.
what
we
say
is
this,
first
statement
i
will
make
is
that
the
offer
which
they
made
was
after
the
ex
--
and
i
admit
ex
parte
restraining
order
and
the
offer
wasn't
made
until
after
we
we're
going
to
get
down
to
the
nub
of
the
case,
the
facts
of
the
case
and
that
is
something
i
think
that
should
be
borne
in
mind
into
spelling
this
which
i
think
petitioner
is
trying
to
create,
this
aura
of
unfairness
in
alabama.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
oh
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
they
are,
sir.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes.
they
have
not
at
that
point,
however,
made
any
offer
of
compliance,
whatsoever.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no,
that
is
not
a
frivolous
question.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
am
going
to
make
one
correction
and
i
think
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
--
the
most
important
correction.
alabama
did
not
throw
them
into
contempt.
they
need
never
have
been
in
contempt.
they
could
have
tested
the
order
to
produce
without
ever
the
slightest
risk
of
contempt.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
our
cases
don't
hold
that
in
a
proper
way.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
specific
question
in
--
in
considerable
detail
and
explain
the
fairness
of
the
alabama
procedure
and
that
is
this,
the
alabama
procedure
on
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
if
in
case
of
a
third
party
or
an
order
to
produce
documents
is
that
that
is
an
interlocutory
order
not
appealable.
the
proper
remedy
is
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.
and
why
is
that?
because
the
person
does
not
have
to
set
himself
up
as
the
sole
judge
of
relevancy,
the
sole
judge
of
constitutionality
and
bring
himself
to
the
position
of
flat
out
as
this
petitioner
did
in
open
court
and
saying,
“we
don't
need
anymore
time.
we
choose
to
stand
on
these
rights.”
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
if
i'm
right.
well,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
9
and
17,
thereof,
ex
parte
monroe
county
bank,
254
ala.
515.
now
that
i
will
grant
you
the
monroe
county
bank
was
not
a
party
to
the
action.
they
were
--
this
was
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
in
that
case,
they
didn't
choose
or
felt
that
they
did
not
have
the
duty
to
produce
certain
records
in
a
divorce
proceeding.
husband
against
wife
and
of
course
these
financial
matters
become
very
important.
if
they
proceeded
by
writ
of
mandamus
to
test
the
validity
of
that
subpoena
duces
tecum
in
the
alabama
court
and
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
and
all
the
questions
we're
passed
on
it.
now
that
isn't
enough.
that
doesn't
make
a
great
long
line
of
cases.
in
addition,
ex
parte
hart
cited
in
the
supreme
courts'
opinion
had
a
similar
question
of
an
order
to
produce.
the
court
didn't
discuss
that
thing
at
length.
it
was
just
the
well
accepted
method
in
alabama.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
all
right.
i
--
i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
a
petition
for
certiorari
has
ever
been
treated
as
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
the
cases
which
both
parties
have
cited,
ex
parte
morris
at
pages
8,
14
and
15
of
the
respondent's
brief,
is
a
case
which
comes
to
mind
as
well
as
the
instant
case.
of
course
we
submit
in
the
instant
case
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
we
are
going
to
exposit
essentially.
we're
going
to
demonstrate
for
future
guidance
of
use
but
they
did
not
make
them
the
basis
of
the
decision.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
distinction
to
make
and
extremely
important
one
in
this
case
and
also
in
ex
parte
morris.
ex
parte
morris
concerned
this
question.
a
--
an
officer
of
the
ku
klux
klan
was
directed
to
bring
before
the
grand
jury
records
of
that
corporation
--
of
that
organization.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no,
this
is
not,
sir.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
this
is
an
alabama
case.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
this
was
a
grand
jury
proceeding
on
a
preliminary
i
suppose
to
some
criminal
action.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
and
he
said
he
stood
on
his
constitutional
rights
not
to
do
it
and
was
held
in
contempt.
he
--
he
was
brought
in
before
the
judge
and
the
judge
says,
“you'll
produce
them.”
now,
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
is
the
established
law
of
alabama
for
reviewing
contempt
citations
whether
civil
or
criminal
and
a
writ
for
certiorari
was
denied
because
on
the
face
of
the
proceedings,
the
court
had
jurisdiction,
nice
little
memorandum
decision.
then
they
said,
“however,
we're
going
to
exposit
our
views
on
these
constitutional
questions,
not
as
a
basis
of
decision
as
i
read
the
case.
but
merely
because
we'd
like
people
to
know
that
corporations,
for
example,
don't
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
don't
have
a
right
of
secrecy.”
now
those
are
the
chief
cases
which
i
have
studied
on
this
other
than
--
and
that
i
know
of
myself
that
really
face
up
to
these
problems
except
ex
parte
dickens
also
cited
in
petitioner's
brief
and
our
brief.
if
you
wish,
i
will
refer
the
page
number
and
i
think
i
can
explain
that
case
too,
and
it
shows
that
the
merits
of
the
case
we're
not
considered.
in
that
case,
petition
for
certiorari,
what
was
considered
was
contempt
of
an
order
to
deliver
certain
bonds
and
other
documents
to
a
receiver
and
equity.
the
court
reiterated
the
traditional
view
that
certiorari
--
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
proceedings.
you
see
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
of
the
persons
--
the
parties
i
should
say,
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
whether
there
was
a
contempt,
whether
all
the
procedural
aspects
of
a
contempt
proceeding
are
followed,
remembering
that
it
is
a
completely
ancillary
proceeding.
now,
and
they
held
that
in
fact
since
the
face
of
the
proceeding
is
so
that
in
fact
the
he
had
obeyed
the
order
and
that
there
hadn't
been
any
new
order,
even
though
a
new
receiver
had
been
appointed,
there
was
no
contempt.
they
went
on
to
say
that
if
there
was
a
question
of
a
payment
of
a
debt,
the
debt
could
be
reviewed
on
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now
they
didn't
say
--
they
didn't
do
as
the
morris
case
and
in
this
case.
they
didn't
say,
“well,
now,
we
said
all,
we're
got
to
say
all
we
have
to
say.”
they
just
went
on
and
discussed
this
question
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
had
he
been
imprisoned
in
this
case
to
pay
a
debt
which
might
well
had
been
the
case,
why
then
he
could
have
reviewed
it
for
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
there
maybe
other
cases
in
alabama,
i
regret
i
don't
know
of
any
other
which
bears
on
this
issue.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
understand
it
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
am
to
assume
this
fact
and
this
is
the
only
one
i
understand
that
the
case
history
of
alabama
shows
that
while
they
pretend
to
this
nicety
of
pleading
in
practice,
that
in
fact
when
they
get
one
of
these
important
questions
where
they
simply
just
say,
“well,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
thing
anyway.”
that's
--
that's
what
i
am
to
assume.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
then
i
think
that
there
is
--
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
--
has
an
extremely
dubious
case
of
no
federal
question.
in
other
words,
that
--
that
--
but
if
you
can
reach
this
position
which
i
would
--
it
would
seem
to
me
you
were
heading
that
they
decided
to
make
some
sort
of
an
exception
in
this
case.
then
it
--
i
think
it
were
perilously
close
to
a
case
which
was
decided
here
monday,
this
baxley
case.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
don't
concede
entrapment
however
or
springs
in
this
case.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
on
a
motion
to
dissolve.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
our
contention
and
that
is
correct
under
my
understanding
of
the
law.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
it
has
an
inherent
power.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
and
also
a
statutory
in
the
case
of
criminal
contempt.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
because
we
break
it
down
into
--
into
two
steps,
you
have
really
two
ancillary
proceedings
and
ancillary
questions.
you
have
first
the
validity
of
the
order
to
produce
which
is
tested
by
mandamus
and
secondly,
then
if
they
choose
to
just
say
as
this
petitioner
did,
we're
not
going
to
--
we
ignore
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
but
they
did
to
test
only
the
order
to
produce
and
if
you
then
choose
the
route
of
saying
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no.
first,
the
mandamus
goes
only
to
test
the
validity
of
the
order
to
produce
and
maybe
commenced
anytime
after
the
order
is
entered
and
being
an
interlocutory
non-appealable
order.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
frankly,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
writ
of
mandamus
and
writ
of
prohibition
are
--
are
--
if
i
were
a
purist,
i
would
say
often
what
appears
to
be
mandamus
is
a
writ
of
prohibition.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
by
appeal.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
absolutely
and
there
is
a
very
important
point
to
me
in
connection
with
that.
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
now,
there
was
a
case
cited
yesterday
which
i
was
not
personally
aware
of.
i
believe
i
have
that
citation
68
so.2d
834,
this
armstrong
case
which
is
a
--
we
maintained
--
the
court
did
not
look
at
the
merits.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
they
applied
for
certiorari
and
it
was
treated
as
mandamus.
the
case
isn't
at
all
that
case.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
oh
this
was
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
at
armstrong
case,
it's
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
that
bears
--
that
seems
to
even
bear
on
it.
and
that
in
fact
was
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
court
to
hold
the
man
in
contempt
to
take
contempt
proceeding
against
and
even
though
he
had
very
possibly
on
a
record
violated
the
order
and
then
they
threw
in
a
sort
of
general
prayer
on
top
of
the
appeal.
and
the
court
reviewed
the
portion
of
the
contempt
proceedings,
they
also
reviewed
other
matters
on
the
merits
of
the
whole
case
as
i
see
it
on
the
appeal
feature
but
specifically
on
the
contempt
feature,
they
said,
“well,
as
far
as
this
contempt
--
pure
contempt
angle,
we
will
consider
to
that
extent
certiorari,”
and
they
did
in
fact.
they
didn't
look
at
the
merits
except
to
this
extent
which
is
the
established
alabama
law
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
a
contempt.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
see
what
you're
--
absolutely
what
you're
getting
at.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
understand.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
in
that
case,
they
did
in
fact
told
that
this
was
a
proper
order
and
as
i
say,
it
seem
to
me
they
looked
at
it
on
the
appeal
feature.
in
other
words
they
appealed
--
in
this
question
of
appeal
whether
the
order
was
an
order
which
was
proper.
they
didn't
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
oh,
not
in
our
case.
i'm
not
speaking
of
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i'm
taking
about
this
armstrong
case
which
was
a
--
one
of
this
custody
of
children
cases
among
other
things
and
also
a
question
of
accrued
alimony.
there
are
a
number
of
complicating
features.
i
--
i
see
the
--
not
only
the
drift
of
the
question
but
you
do
get
sort
to
that
point
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
as
far
as
the
way
the
court
talks
they
say
we're
looking
strictly
at
the
face
of
these
contempt
proceedings
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
think
that
if
the
case
is
in
fact
ran
that
way
i
think
that
you
would
be
correct.
i
--
i
don't
know
that
--
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
do
go
that
way.
the
armstrong
case
has
opposed
this
thing
to
that.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
would
likely
to
explain
exactly
what
happened
in
that
case.
they
made
an
application
for
stay.
there's
no
petition
for
certiorari
or
with
any
kind
of
pleading.
they
just
went
up
there
and
said
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
“we're
in
this
terrible
fix.
there
were
no
facts
or
anything,
just
stay
in
the
proceedings.”
and
the
court
said,
“we
--
when
there
--
it's
a
question
of
a
contempt
proceeding
certiorari
--
the
contempt
proceeding,
the
review
of
a
contempt
proceeding,
we
have
to
have
a
petition
for
certiorari.”
(voice
overlap)
jurisdiction.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
first
of
all,
taking
what
was
actually
before
the
court
in
the
second
petition,
it
amount
--
it
had
no
facts
alleged.
they
were
merely
what
we
can
call
assignments
of
error
which
are
set
out
in
our
briefs.
i
stand
corrected
on
that.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no
they
are
not
in
this
record.
they
are
not
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
they
have
not.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
printed
record
in
this
case
which
consists
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
exhibits
is
the
record
in
the
case.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
it
is
included
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
the
state's
petition
is
included
in
the
record.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
record
pages
1,
2
and
3.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
stand
corrected,
what
i
should
say
is
that
this
is
a
synopsis
and
rather
of
our
petition.
it
is
not
the
petition
itself,
i
stand
corrected.
the
petition
itself
that
we
filed
in
the
initial
proceedings
is
not
in
this
record.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
have
--
do
not
have
them
with
me
here.i
am
certain
that
if
as
for
--
they
will
all
be
supplied.
all
that
was
before
the
supreme
court
was
set
up
that
was
asked
for
from
the
supreme
court.
now
in
addition,
there
were
--
was
this
initial
petition
for
certiorari
--
i'm
not
addressing
myself
now
to
our
petition
but
this
initial
petition
for
certiorari
which
page
--
appears
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record.
i
should
again
qualify
that
statement
by
saying
that
these
are
the
grounds
alleged
in
that
and
that
all
that
was
alleged
in
it
was
what
i
call
an
assignment
of
error.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
is
correct.
we
did
--
we
concurred
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
should
be
happy
to,
your
honor.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
now,
there
are
really
several
questions
of
the
merits
involved
here.
there
is
first
the
merit
--
the
question
of
the
state's
power
to
take
any
such
initial
action
and
we
based
that
on
the
plenary
common
law
powers
of
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
to
vindicate
and
enforce
the
public
policy
of
alabama
concerning
the
domestication
of
foreign
corporations.
i'm
talking
about
that
constitutional
provision,
section
232
which
is
self-implementing.
we
think
that
an
attorney
general
has
the
inherent
right
and
in
fact
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
it
is
not
set
out
in
the
briefs,
i
have
it
here.
i'm
now
reading
from
the
alabama
code
of
1940
which
also
includes
the
alabama
constitution,
article
xii
section
232.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
--
right
now.
“no
foreign
corporation
shall
do
any
business
in
this
state
without
having
at
least
one
known
place
of
business
and
an
authorized
agent
or
agents
therein,
and
without
filing
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
certified
copy
of
its
articles
of
incorporation
or
association.
such
corporation
maybe
sued
in
any
county
where
it
does
business
by
service
of
process
upon
an
agent
anywhere
in
the
state.
the
legislature
shall,
by
general
law,
provide
for
the
payment
to
the
state
of
alabama
of
a
franchise
tax
by
such
corporation,
but
such
franchise
tax
shall
be
based
on
the
actual
amount
of
capital
employed
in
this
state.
strictly
benevolent,
educational
or
religious
corporations
shall
not
be
required
to
pay
such
tax.”
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
certainly
shall.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
was
saying
that
we
have
the
plenary
common
law
powers
that
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
is
a
constitutional
officer
who
has
the
same
powers
which
the
attorney
general
of
great
britain
had
at
common
law.
we
depend
upon
those
cases,
a
long
line
of
cases
which
say
that
a
corporation
doing
intrastate
business
in
a
state
or
rather
the
supreme
court
decisions
which
say
that
a
corporation
maybe
prevented
doing
intrastate
business
within
a
state
if
it
hasn't
first
gone
there
and
conform
to
the
laws
of
that
state.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
absolutely
not,
no
statutory
law
whatsoever.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
whether
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
think
that
the
--
the
authority
to
oust
is
--
is
in
the
courts
of
alabama
to
punish
--
perhaps
punish
is
not
--
is
too
strong
a
word,
but
to
--
i
believe
it
is
a
correct
one
for
having
--
for
a
long
period
of
time
ignored
our
laws
and
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
they
were
doing
business
and
how
long
in
the
extent
and
nature
of
there
--
were
absolutely
essential
to
the
case.
now,
we
think
that
the
power
to
oust
for
past
misconduct
included
the
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo
as
between
the
parties,
and
that
is
what
this
order
denying
the
right
to
register
did.
it's
the
traditional
power
of
the
court
of
equity.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no.
we've
never
had
an
--
we've
never
had
a
case
like
this
before.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
we've
had
cases
where
--
where
corporations
--
oh,
i
won't
say
that.
i
don't
know
of
anywhere
corporations
were
delinquent
in
this
manner.
there
are
other
constitutional
questions
--
i
don't
want
to
dodge
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
there's
--
there
is
a
dispute
in
our
opinion
which
has
never
been
written,
i
admit.
our
opinion
is
that
he
could,
first
of
all,
he
has
the
duty
to
refer
it
to
the
franchise
tax
people
for
determination
of
whether
or
not
in
fact
this
is
a
benevolent
corporation
within
the
meaning
of
the
law
of
exemptions
or
a
charitable
and
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
oh,
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
in
fact
accept
the
filing
and
it
is
not
accepted
until
the
franchise
tax
people
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
franchise
taxes
due.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
procedure.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
that
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
the
basis
for
the
action
is
that
they
were
delinquent
--
the
basis
of
the
action
is
a
long-term
extensive
delinquency
which
we
think
is
in
derogation
of
the
rights
of
the
people
of
alabama
not
to
have
corporations
come
in,
foreign
corporations,
and
just
ignore
their
statutes.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
you
mean
why
is
that
relevant?
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
well,
i
--
i
disagree
with
that
contention
entirely.
i
don't
believe
a
corporation
has
any
right
of
privacy
and
that
any
case
of
this
court
or
--
has
ever
held
any
such
thing.
i
can
address
myself
to
that.
i
think
the
recent
cases
such
as
watkins
and
sweezy
are
questions
of
assertions
of
individual
rights,
i
see.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
am.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
understand.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
my
first
answer
of
course
is
i
don't
agree
with
that
portion
of
the
opinion
but
i
will
also
direct
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
individual
opinion,
that's
what
i
mean,
mr.
justice
jackson.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
all
right.
i
--
i
would
--
if
i
may
address
myself
exactly
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
jackson,
preliminarily
to
holding
--
making
that
statement
held
that
a
corporation
had
no
right
of
privacy,
that
in
fact
if
all
the
order
of
the
attorney
general
in
that
case
had
done
was
hold
individual
members
up
to
contumely
and
unpopularity
and
all
of
the
things
which
i
might
say
are
speculative
in
the
instant
case,
through
speculation,
that
if
that
were
all,
he
would
say
that
the
corporation
did
have
any
standing
but
that
would
had
happened
and
remind
--
i
want
to
remind
you
that
it
was
entirely
state
action.
both
the
first
and
second
pressures
brought
there
was
entirely
state
action.
one
was
the
ex
parte
action
of
the
attorney
general
in
declaring
the
organization
subversive
which
i
--
insofar
there
is
a
majority
opinion
i
would
say
the
basis
of
it
and
then
you
get
to
the
next
step
which
was
by
virtue
of
that
order,
here,
where
a
lot
of
innocent
people
who
are
going
to
lose
jobs
automatically
state
job
--
and
the
jobs
which
they
were
going
to
lose
automatically
were
government
jobs
so
that
was
obviously
government
action.
now
i
--
perhaps
i
haven't
exactly
answered
the
content
--
that
is
how
i
explained
that
decision.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
damageable
from
whom
is
that
important
question.
first
of
all,
i
would
want
to
make
a
point
which
bears
precisely
on
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
oh,
the
state
isn't
going
to
bring
any
pressure
to
bear
on
these
individuals.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
anything
in
the
law
that
says
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
person
may
become
unpopular
as
a
result
of
a
disclosure
gives
him
a
constitutional
right
to
keep
a
secret.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
--
i
have
a
hard
time
feeling
that
that
--
there
would
be
probably
an
embarrassing
word
of
justiciable
issue
there.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
unless
he
can
get
--
bring
it
against
an
alleged
extremely
specific
details
in
that.
in
other
words,
say
that
this
person
is
without
justification
causing
me
to
lose
my
business.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
because
the
--
the
thing
which
may
--
which
may
and
that's
pure
speculation
in
the
allegations
in
here
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
sir?
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
believe
it
would
and
i
will
explain
why.
i
believe
neither
the
sweezy
cases
and
the
watkins
case
which
seemed
to
pair
on
this
right
to
not
to
have
to
testify
about
associations,
our
answer
on
this
basis
that
in
this
case,
we
have
relevancy
to
a
judicial
proceeding
and
we
submit
an
extremely
valid
judicial
proceeding
and
i
might
add
in
this
particular
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
no,
no,
no,
to
the
--
to
the
central
issue
in
the
case
whether
they're
doing
business
in
alabama
and
whether
they
should
be
ousted.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
agree.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
don't
think
a
person
has
such
immunity
from
testifying
in
a
case
that
he
is
properly
subpoenaed.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
oh,
it
does
and
i
--
i
can't
--
i
failed
to
find
any
judicial
authority
for
that
particular
--
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
show
that
our
questions
were
relevant
to
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
don't
believe
that
he
could.
in
fact,
i
--
deny
that
he
could.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
i
wish
i
could
--
i
do
not
detain
anyone
further
in
this
matter.
mr.
edmon
l.
rinehart
(inaudible)
your
honor.
