justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
incorporation,
would
you
mind
being
a
little
more
specific?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
--
under
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that's
what
i
meant.
it's
a
particular
kind
of
associated
body,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
tender
to
the
court
all
the
documents
except
for
the
members
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
i
--
i
want
to
be
sure.
i
heard
mr.
carter
to
say,
did
you
express
readiness
to
file?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
still
not
all
of
the
--
all
the
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
or
are
there
items
in
the
forms
which
you
were
unrelated
to,
to
which
you're
not
willing
to
respond?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
did
this
filled
out
form
bear
the
name
of
any
person
and
the
signature?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
it
--
what
i
want
to
know.
was
there
--
was
there
in
that
form
appears
the
name
of
any
person
or
persons?
justice
felix
frankfurter
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
has
pertinence
as
you
will
doubt
as
well
as
infer
from
what
is
required
and
what
may
be
required
--
or
may
not
be
required
in
the
disclosure,
that's
why
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
it
--
was
there
any
trading
by
the
judge
or
was
there
any
statement
of
what
the
$10,000
fine
was
for
or
against?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
you
continued
to
disobey.
that's
what
the
$100,000
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
$10,000
fine
must
have
been
for
the
refusal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
purging
yourself
of
all
the
contempt
except
on
the
member's
list.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
the
interlocutory
decree,
there
was
an
ex
parte
--
that
was
ex
parte,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ex
parte
proceeding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
did
that
restrain
you
--
didn't
that
restrain
you
from
doing
any
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
together?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
merely
a
dislocation,
but
you
were
restrained
from
doing
any
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
ex
parte.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
tied
you
completely.
that
immobilized
you
until
the
restraining
order
came
on
--
if
it
did
come
on
for
a
hearing.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
never
came.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
you
continue
under
the
restraint
of
that
until
the
contempt
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
when
did
the
--
when
did
the
obligation
of
that
restraining
order
seized?
when
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
restraining
order
continued
to
run
and
runs
to
this
moment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
according
to
alabama
law,
whether
it's
the
decision
of
the
statute,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
according
to
alabama
law,
a
restraining
order,
putting
new
for
the
time
being
out
of
business
completely,
continues
and
has
not
been
reviewed
or
it
has
not
been
considered
for
the
view
--
to
setting
it
aside
and
making
it
permanent
because
in
the
meantime
--
in
the
meantime,
the
state
moved
disclosure
and
you
did
not
fully
satisfy
the
requirement
of
disclosure
granted
by
the
judge.
you
offered
some
compliance,
but
not
all
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
thereupon
cast
you
in
contempt
and
that
--
that
as
it
was
suspended
any
action
on
the
restraining
order
except
that
the
restraining
order
still
restrained
you.is
that
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
under
alabama
law,
supposed
you
were
to
pay
the
$100,000
because
you
continued
in
recalcitrance
and
disobedience,
and
referred
yourself
by
performance,
but
paid
the
fine.
is
the
restraining
order,
the
motion
to
dissolve
not
appealable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
there
is
this
extensive
restraining
order.
in
the
meantime,
the
state
asked
for
some
disclosure
and
you
feel
that
that's
the
thing
you
shouldn't
disclose
and
you
stand
part
on
that.
does
that
mean
you
have
to
live
under
that
restraining
order
continuously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
$100,000
--
this
isn't
a
bargain.you
don't
say
you
can
either
obey
or
pay
$100,000.
it
isn't
that
kind
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
to
hold
the
order
of
contempt
that's
set
to
--
to
set
it
aside
in
state,
throughout
the
state
for
the
proceedings
or
set
it
aside
until
we
had
an
opportunity
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
july
31st,
we
had
a
hearing
before
the
court,
ruled
that
the
only
way
for
the
supreme
court
to
review
contempt
adjudications
was
on
certiorari,
but
since
we
have
not
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
it
did
not
considered
that
it
could
interfere
the
action
of
the
court
insofar
as
the
contempt
of
adjudication
is
concerned.
at
that
point
and
even
before
this
decision
was
handed
down,
the
circuit
court
issued
its
second
order
of
contempt
which
find
--
found
that
we
have
failed
to
comply
within
five
days
and
found
this
in
further
contempt
and
fined
us
for
$100,000.
on
august
the
8th,
we
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
this
was
denied
as
insufficient
after
hearing
on
august
the
13th.
we
filed
another
petition
on
august
20
and
that
petition
was
--
the
opinion
was
handed
down
which
is
the
--
which
is
in
the
record
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
mr.
carter,
if
you,
conscientiously
and
unquestioningly,
concluded
that
under
alabama
law,
these
should
have
been
raised
on
mandamus.
that
was
your
clear
conviction.
then,
you
would
think
the
state
court
decided
it
on
a
state
ground
which
if
you
sought
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand.
if
they
said
we
decide
it,
but
i
thought
this
depends
on
justice
brennan
that
you
said
you
had
honestly
to
say
that
they
said
we
don't
indeed,
although
we
talk
about
this
thing.
we
really
go
in
that
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
if
you
thought
that's
the
ground
they
went
on
and
if
you
thought
they
were
right
about
that
ground
then
it
would
be
a
state
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
but
--
but
your
contention
is
that
that
isn't
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
contention
is
that
a
fair
reading
of
alabama
cases
makes
clear
that
as
a
matter
of
facts,
on
certiorari
it
does
go
beyond
for
mere
technical
questions
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
that's
alabama
law
in
other
cases,
they
can't
refuse
it
in
a
case
involving
a
federal
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr
carter,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
your
position
on
the
question
of
the
duty
to
file
a
certificate
with
the
secretary
of
state
if
that's
the
official.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
was
all
that
was
in
issue
here,
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
you
profit
the
signing
of
it.
that's
because
you
are
ready
to
file
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
isn't
before
us
then,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
reason
for
--
the
reason
why
states
want
to
have
foreign
corporation
so-called
to
file
their
certificate
is
in
order
to
protect
their
own
citizens
for
various
reasons,
so
as
to
know
whom
to
sue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
have
your
membership
corporation,
which
mean
that
you're
doing
business
without
profit
and
therefore,
the
restriction
or
the
qualifications
are
different
in
new
york
from
what
they
have
forbidden.
if
you
raised
this
file
and
if
the
state
has
a
right
or
at
least
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
to
bar
louisiana
--
alabama
from
saying,
“you
must
file
a
certificate,”
because
if
you
are
engaged
in
any
kind
of
activity,
have
an
office,
you
rent
something.
you
may
owe
the
landlord
or
you're
--
the
conditions
maybe
in
--
in
such
order,
that
order
that
the
licensee
coming
in
therefore
and
sue
somebody,
and
they
have
the
right
to
know
whom
to
sue,
who's
responsible.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there
is
a
distinction
that
i'd
like
to
put
it
here,
between
requiring
--
i'm
not
saying
what
the
legal
consequence
is.
there
is
a
distinction
between
alabama's
right
to
say,
“you
give
us
the
names
of
your
officers,
and
you
give
us
the
names
of
people
scattered
all
over
alabama
which
support
your
cost.”
isn't
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
responsible
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
no
objection
to
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr
carter,
may
i
get
a
little
more
light
from
you?
it
is
alabama
law
you
say
that
when
a
--
when
a
--
what
do
you
call
that,
restraining
order
is
outstanding,
if
you
don't
obey
it,
if
you
don't
obey
and
therefore
it
could
be
thrown
into
contempt.
you
can't
raise
the
--
the
validity
or
the
scope
of
the
restraining
order.
is
that
right?
that's
what
you
say
is
alabama
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
that
ordinary
provision
of
alabama
law
suspending
a
restraining
order
does
not
bar
this
court
from
saying
that
you
were
thrown
into
contempt
for
disobeying
a
restraining
order
that
was
--
that
exceeded
the
constitutional
speed
limit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that,
they
prohibited
you
from
doing
business
when
there
was
no
relation
between
that
protection
given
to
alabama
and
any
interest
of
it
under
--
ensured
that
there
was
no
possible
irreparable
damage
that
required
such
an
extreme
restriction
of
your
right.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although
on
a
restraining
order
in
ordinary
instances,
that
might
be
alright.
now
second,
do
you
say
that
you're
drawn
in
contempt
because
you
disobeyed
or
build
with
discovery
or
whatever
it's
called,
one
of
the
features
of
which
was
the
disclosure
of
your
membership
and
that
alabama
had
no
right
to
exact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
the
two
chief
--
are
those
the
two
things?
what
else
is
there
that
you
complain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
i
understand,
those
are
the
two
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
the
fine
--
the
amount?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
say
to
the
decision
of
this
court
that
obedience
is
due
to
an
order
even
though
a
court
may
later
be
found
to
have
improperly
issued
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
the
only
way
you
contest
that.
so
that
you're
not
within
louis
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that,
you
didn't
snap
your
fingers
at
the
junction
--
the
injunctive
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
ordered
to
produce
and
you
think
you're
ordered
to
produce
something
that
the
constitution
had
no
right
to
ask
you
to
produce
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
stood
your
ground.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
a
particular
provision
of
that
restraining
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all,
was
this
--
was
this
corporation
notoriously
doing
business
in
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
they've
been
notoriously
doing
business
for
a
good
many
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
probably
before
that,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
they
do
that,
but
i
mean
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
importance
to
you
of
their
disobedience
from
the
state
point
of
view
to
file
a
certificate
or
to
apply
for
it.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
they've
been
doing
this
notorious
business
as
i
should
think
they
would
take
judicial
notice
of.
state
officials
also
have
this
knowledge
and
--
and
therefore,
it
has
some
bearing
on
it
on
whether
overnight
you
need
to
put
him
out
of
business
by
a
restraining
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
statute
regarding
the
domestication
of
foreign
corporation
have
a
provision
that
until
such
a
certificate
of
whatever
you
call
it,
have
foreign
corporation
can
sue
in
your
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
legal
person
capable
of
being
brought,
coming
in
to
court
and
being
brought
to
this
case
shows
in
to
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
got
a
legal
existence
as
it
were
subject
to
handicap.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
they're
subject
to
handicaps.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this.
you
correct
me
if
i
misunderstand
it
--
if
my
understanding
is
inaccurate.
you
brought
out
the
proceeding
against
the
naacp.
they
said
they
didn't
come
within
your
law
either
because
they
are
a
membership
corporation
of
new
york
or
because
what
they
did
in
alabama
does
not
include
what
legally
speaking
is
doing
business
in
alabama.
but
they
said
as
you
can
have
them
to
say,
i
think
to
seldom
say
on
the
advice
of
counsel,
well
whether
we
are
right
or
wrong
and
lead
him
first
to
comply.
so
they
say
we're
ready
to
file
this
certificate
if
this
is
what
you
want.
but
they
did
contend
the
coercive
power
of
alabama
to
make
this
file.
that's
correct
isn't
it?
didn't
they
deny
that
they
come
within
your
law
requiring
to
do
anything
including
what
they
did
do
in
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
they
--
but
you
said,
they
have
been
doing
over
these
years
during
which
they
didn't
file
--
that
they
should
have
filed
a
certificate
and
domesticate
themselves,
isn't
that
true?
you
said
they've
been
doing
business
for
good
many
years
in
alabama
and
certainly
way
back
since
1918
or
probably
earlier
in
connection
with
their
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
say,
you've
been
doing
business
without
the
requisite
provision
of
alabama.
they
said,
“we
don't
come
within
your
law.we
didn't
have
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
getting
a
certificate
but
in
the
interest
of
whatever
it
is,
convenience,
we
are
ready
to
file
this
certificate.”
and
you
said,
“no,
we
don't
have
to
accept
it.”
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
and
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that's
quickly
summarized,
the
state
got
a
restraining
order
against
them
calling
for
the
cessation
of
all
business
although
they
raised,
what
i
supposed,
is
not
a
frivolous
or
a
ridiculous
objection
to
the
claim
asserted
by
the
state.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
there's
much
to
the
point,
but
sometimes
it
drives
how
often
--
a
majority
of
my
brothers
think
there's
something
to
a
point
which
i
think
there's
nothing
or
by
subversive.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
correct
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
what
i've
stated
was
merely
preliminary
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
think
on
that
statement
that
alabama
did
something
that
was
wrong.
this
is
merely
--
i
want
to
see
if
the
preliminary
facts
seemed
to
me
irrelevant
to
the
question
i'm
going
to
put
to
you
or
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
you
get
a
restraining
order
against
him
not
to
do
business.
they
must
shut
up
sharp,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
did
--
you
told
them
they
must
shut
up
sharp.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
validity
of
that
order,
not
only
the
validity
of
the
order
but
the
scope
of
the
decree
could
be
contested.
the
state
begins
another
proceeding
and
says,
produce
certain
documents.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
you
are
asking
us
to
produce
documents
which
we
are
entitled.
now
whatever
rights
--
by
the
rights
we
have
under
the
united
states
constitution
to
withhold.
that
certainty
is
not
a
frivolous
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
being
so,
what
i
want
to
put
to
you
is
that
pending
the
determination
of
what
is
not
a
frivolous
question,
what
is
a
substantial
question
that
respectable
lawyers
can
raise
and
do
raise
and
have
raised,
alabama
takes
the
position
that
although
this
organization
has
been
in
alabama
all
these
years
without
any
attention
or
objection
from
the
authority
with
alabama.
i
am
not
talking
about
a
stopple.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
nature
of
the
remedy.
although
that
has
been
so
and
although
they
raised
that
question
ancillary
to
the
proceedings
of
oust.
alabama
says,
“you
go
out
of
business
until
this
long
trail
of
litigation
because
you
have,
standing
on
constitutional
right
said,
“you
don't
have
to
obey
this.”
alabama
then
throws
them
in
contempt
but
all
this
time
they
are
executed.
they
get
a
death
sentence
pro
tem
although
in
the
end,
it
may
turn
out
that
they
we're
constitutionally
right.
you're
not
(voice
overlap)
of
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
tested
it
in
way
in
which
they
thought
they
contested
according
to
your
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
the
question
before
us
whether
they
raise
it
by
a
--
whether
a
certiorari
by
which
they
sought
to
raise
it,
raised
all
these
issues.
and
even
your
supreme
court
said
we
don't
have
to
consider
this
but
we
do
consider
them.
it's
the
love
of
the
counsel
that
they
had
a
right
to
pursue
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
and
that's
the
only
person
to
whom
i
can
ever
(inaudible).
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
if
it
can
be
established
that
the
orderly,
traditional,
settled
procedure
of
alabama
requires
the
rating
of
these
questions
solely
by
mandamus
and
i
think
the
other
side
is
out
of
court
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
because
alabama
has
the
right
to
say,
“it
should
be
raised
by
mandamus
and
not
by
certiorari,
if
you're
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
if
my
reading
with
all
the
consciousness
that
one
should
have
about
reading
the
decisions
of
a
state
or
the
law
which
he
isn't
familiar
except
by
reading.
if
my
reading
of
your
cases
were
a
consistent
document
that
mandamus
is
the
crucial
remedy,
i
would
have
to
go
with
you.
but
if
my
reading
of
your
cases
is
this
that
sometimes
alabama
does
and
sometimes
alabama
doesn't
allow
all
the
substantive
questions
to
be
raised
on
certiorari
then
i'd
say
to
you
that
it
can't
invoke
that
doctrine
when
the
federal
right
is
asserted
when
it
doesn't
invoke
at
another
instances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i
suggested.
i
don't
think
this
court
--
i
don't
think
i
can
say
that
that
which
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
treats
a
certiorari
should
be
deemed
to
be
a
mandamus.
that's
not
my
function.
but
if
i
find
that
on
certiorari,
it
has
intermittently
considered
all
substantive
questions
and
then
it
can
draw
the
curtain
when
a
federal
question
is
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
suppose
--
suppose
one
finds
that
while,
as
a
matter
of
(inaudible),
your
court
thinks
mandamus
is
the
way
to
do
it
but
suppose
as
a
matter
of
practice,
one
finds
that
in
fact
they
do
consider,
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
habit
or
course
of
judicial
practice.
they
do
consider
the
merit
and
that
one
further
finds
that
they've
been
drawn
--
they
drew
the
distinction
in
this
case
but
they
haven't
gone
with
others
and
reaches
the
merits.
let's
make
that
assumption
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
can.
we
lawyers
can
see
both
sides
as
we
are
supposed
to.
why
do
you
say
then
assuming
that
the
case
is
here
in
other
words
is
not
to
be
dismissed
because,
one,
of
the
federal
question
and
the
other
one
of
the
disposition
of
a
--
in
a
local
ground,
what
do
you
say
to
the
procedure,
to
the
decree
of
the
restraining
order
which
puts
and
an
enterprise
out
of
business
although
it
raises
--
barely
raises
federal
constitutional
question
and
although
no
--
no
grounds
at
least
i
heard,
mentioned,
given
some.
there's
no
--
no
serious
ground
for
saying
anything
will
happen.
there
will
be
irreparable
damage
if
you,
for
the
time
being,
you
don't
put
a
body
out
of
business
although
ultimately
it
maybe
found
that
you
had
no
business
to
restrain
it
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
that
--
that
they
drew
the
line
here
that
you're
asking
us
to
draw
the
line
here
but
we
find
the
case
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
court
did
review
it
--
did
review
the
issues,
the
federal
question
that
it
is
here
that
is
sought
to
be
brought
here
and
that
therefore
it
is
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
certiorari
--
one
more
question.
is
certiorari
a
discretionary
writ
in
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
before
you
sit
down,
your
doubt
is
familiar
with
the
joint
facet
of
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
your
doubt
is
familiar
with
the
diversity
of
views
expressed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
one
cannot
say
that
there
was
anything
but
a
single
judgment.
but
you
will
recall,
mr.
justice
jackson,
in
which
he
sustain
standing
to
sue
on
the
part
of
the
corporate
entities,
the
non-individual
bodies
that
would
be
forced
in
that
case
on
the
ground
that
if
the
individuals
cannot
assert
their
constitutional
claim,
members,
in
other
words
in
an
organization
which
is
asked
to
make
disclosure
and
the
individuals
who
are
members
can't
themselves
come
in
to
protect
what
they
claim
to
be
a
constitutional
right
without
frustrating,
without
nullifying
the
very
right
which
they
claim
by
making
a
disclosure.
but
then,
the
corporate
body
can
assert
those
individual
rights.
in
short,
assuming
that
individuals
in
alabama,
inherently
appropriate
(inaudible)
and
say
you
can't
ask
us
whether
we
belong
to
the
n.a.a.c.p,
that's
a
territory
that
is
protected,
i'm
making
that
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
otherwise
there's
no
point.
we
--
we
can
withhold
--
we
don't
have
to
tell
alabama
or
new
york
or
anybody
else
to
what
club
we
belong
provided
that
it
isn't
a
tradition
to
organization.
i'm
putting
that
to
one.
that's
our
constitutional
right.
but
if
we
go
--
have
to
go
on
to
court
and
say,
if
what
you
were
asking
the
organization
to
do
make
hindrance
on
my
right
and
by
that
very
proceeding,
you
nullify
your
rights.
then
the
corporate
body
having
this
undisclosable
--
this
list
of
undisclosable
membership
does
have
a
standing
to
speak
for
the
individual
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
an
opinion.
it
was
an
individual's
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
maybe
was
quite
candid
in
saying
that
he
thought
the
corporation
would
not
have
standing
to
sue
except
in
this
(inaudible)
the
individual
right
does
come
into
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
and
i
suppose
what
is
behind
this
claim
of
refusal
to
disclose
the
individual
members
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
alabama.
i've
taken
that
direct
to
pleading
but
i
take
it
the
thought
is
and
the
reason
for
this
claim
why
the
individuals
don't
step
forward
is
because
they
are
potentially
in
a
damageable
condition
if
they
do
make
disclosure.
that's
how
they
were
told.
justice
felix
frankfurter
damageable
by
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
pressure
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
state
compelled
a
disclosure
if
they
may
just
as
it's
going
to
fascist
case
if
one
of
these
organizations
and
the
attorney
general
had
to
make
closed.
it
would
affect
people.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
an
private
employment
or
public
employment
so
long
as
the
governmental
authority
takes
away
something
that
it
can't
--
can't
take
away?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
implication
of
my
question.
is
it
inconceivable
that
an
individual
might
bring
in
a
--
bring
a
suit
in
alabama
and
say
if
i
make
a
disclosure
that
i'm
a
member
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.,
i
lose
my
business.
is
that
inconceivable
hypothesis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
to
lose
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
this
person
being
--
the
starting
point
is
that
the
state
of
alabama
or
any
other
--
the
state
of
massachusetts
doesn't
make
a
difference
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
state
is
asking
me
to
make
a
disclosure
which
i
am
entitled
to
withhold
and
by
making
such
disclosure,
my
business
will
be
shut
down.
the
government
isn't
shutting
down
the
business
but
it
is
taking
action
which
results
in
the
shutting
down
and
that's
not
justiciable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
can't
--
they
may
not
be
able
to
make
good
on
that.
they
may
not
be
able
to
make
good
on
that
but
if
you
--
supposed
the
joint
fascist
suit
that
old
case
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
have
filed
what
is
practically
a
demurrer
and
said
--
well
suppose
everything
you
say
is
so,
that's
the
basis
on
which
i
have
--
one
has
to
meet
these
legal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
it's
so
that
john
smith
and
whatever
it
is
in
alabama
--
sometimes
alabama
says,
“i
received
a
request
from
the
attorney
general
to
tell
him
--
to
tell
me
whether
i'm
a
member
of
n.a.a.c.p.
and
i
refused
to
do
so.”
and
he
says,
“well
that's
required
by
some
decree
of
the
court
and
if
i
make
this
disclosure
which
i'm
entitled
to
refuse
to
make,
i
will
suffer
and
my
business.
would
that
be
demurrable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
mandamus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
supposed
you
win
on
that,
and
that
supposed
you
can
oust
the
in
the
meantime,
supposed
you
are
entitled
to
oust
them,
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
individuals
may
have
to
make
disclosure
that
they
were
members
of
the
ousted
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
--
if
they
can
allege
and
subsequently
prove
that
in
fact
the
human
inevitable
consequence
is
material
monetary
mundane
punishment
and
their
property
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
that
was
the
demerit
of
whether
such
an
exertion
can
be
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
alabama
tomorrow
can
subpoena
a
lot
of
individuals
in
this
litigation,
supposed
this
proceeds
because
you're
allowed
to
proceed
at
the
ouster
proceeding.
what
you're
saying
is
that
as
a
matter
of
substantive
constitutional
law,
if
alabama's
subpoena
smith
jones
robinson
and
asked
him
on
a
--
him
or
her
on
the
stand,
“are
you
now
or
were
you
a
member
of
n.a.a.c.p.?”
they
could
not
say,
your
honor,
in
every
respect,
i
decline
to
answer
because
i'm
protected
by
the
constitution.
that's
what
you
say
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
there,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
go,
mr.
rinehart
candidly
admitted
that
in
fact
the
supreme
court
goes
ahead
and
talks
about
things
which
it
says
it
merely
talked
about,
it
does
so
merely
makes
speeches
because
it
restricts
its
decision
to
what
it
needs
to
restrict
it
to,
namely,
whether
the
jurisdictions
may
gain
on
the
face
of
the
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
in
other
words
if
the
state
said
we
go
on
this
ground
--
on
the
state
ground,
you
follow
--
you've
taken
the
wrong
attorney,
you
followed
the
wrong
procedure
but
we've
got
lose
up
here,
we
talk
about
things
we
didn't
even
talk
about
and
so
we
make
a
speech.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
but
i
understand
why
you're
arguing
this
because
unless
i
completely
misunderstood
mr.
rinehart,
the
state
isn't
arguing
here
that
we
have
to
pass
on
alabama's
right
of
ouster.
that
isn't
the
issue
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
issue
here
is
the
validity
of
the
contempt
order
as
against
certain
constitutional
claim,
is
that
right?
