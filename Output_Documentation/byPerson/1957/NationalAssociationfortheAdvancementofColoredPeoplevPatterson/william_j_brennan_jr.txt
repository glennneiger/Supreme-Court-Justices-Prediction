justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
under
what
law
did
you
say
the
case
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
membership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
mean
mr.
carter
that,
ordinarily,
a
foreign
corporation
needs
to
do
more
--
no
more
than
that?
is
that
the
case
in
alabama?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
to
this
provision
requiring
(inaudible)
the
fund,
is
that
state
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it
your
motion
to
dissolve
was
never
heard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
they
say
they'll
not
hear
it
unless
you
comply
with
the
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
carter,
will
you
clear
me
up
on
this.
you
read
the
supreme
court's
opinion
as
saying
initially
that
this
should
have
been
by
way
of
mandamus,
not
certiorari.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
yes,
but
then
after
having
decided
that
the
circuit
court
did
have
jurisdiction,
treating
as
within
those
limits
under
certiorari
then
went
on
to
deal
with
the
merits.
is
that
to
say
that
the
merits
were
dealt
with
as
if
you
had
applied
for
mandamus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
is
they
could
have
stopped
in
suggesting
that
the
court
in
fact
went
on
and
dealt
with
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
dealing
with
the
merits,
did
the
court
do
what
it
would
have
done
had
you
come
up
by
way
of
mandamus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
carter,
we
were
to
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
what
was
done
here.
would
you
then
now
have
to
argue
the
question
you
are
about
to
argue?
this
is
not
an
ultimate
ground
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
they
unfairly,
under
the
guidance
of
state
practice
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
even
get
to
it
if
we
agree
with
your
first.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rinehart,
those
statutes
at
35,
do
i
read
them
accurately
that
section
192
requires
the
filing
of
a
certified
copy
of
articles
of
incorporation
under
seal
and
so
forth
and
signed
by
the
president
and
the
secretary,
designating
at
least
one
known
place
of
business
and
an
authorized
agent
or
agents
residing
thereat.
that
is
within
the
state.
now,
that's
all
wasn't
it?
is
there
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
$10
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
--
what
i
was
interested
at
the
moment.
this
is
all
that
the
organization
was
required
to
do
to
domesticate
as
we've
been
using
that
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
not
sure,
it
must
be
true
in
alabama.
i
know
it
is
in
new
jersey,
but
very
often
foreign
corporations
who
have
the
same
obligation
in
my
state
that
they
do
in
europe.
maybe
they're
quite
awhile
before
they
make
these
filings.
that
must
be
so
in
your
state,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
--
oh,
i
know.
they
take
that
position.
the
secretary
of
state
in
new
jersey
takes
the
same
position,
but
i'm
sure
that
there
are
great
many
of
them
who
don't
get
around
to
doing
it
for
some
time.
they
don't
all
do
it
the
first
day
they
show
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
making
a
point
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
delay
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
it
was,
a
year
or
two
years,
whatever
it
maybe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
making
the
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rinehart,
one
last
question
about
this.
this
statute
speaks
of
designating
a
known
place
of
business
and
an
authorized
agent,
authorized
for
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
the
statute
has
a
single
purpose,
doesn't
it,
to
have
a
place
at
which
the
officers
of
the
state
required
to
serve
process
upon
it,
knows
where
it
can
be
reached
and
upon
whom
to
make
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
there's
nothing
unusual
about
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
give
me
one
of
the
48
states
has
an
identical
statute,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
this..
are
you
suggesting
that
on
your
analysis
of
the
alabama
cases,
there
is
none
where
in
fact
in
review
on
certiorari
of
an
order
of
civil
contempt,
your
supreme
court
has
ever
reviewed
the
merits
of
an
order
of
the
underlying
order
which
--
which
was
disobeyed
and
upon
which
the
contempt
finding
was
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
not
addressing
myself
to
that.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
what
happens
when
in
fact
an
order
of
civil
contempt
is
reviewed
on
writ
of
certiorari
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
your
supreme
court
entertain
argument
and
dispose
of
any
arguments
addressed
to
the
validity
of
the
order
allege
to
have
been
disobeyed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
that
involve
--
whether
or
not
there
was
a
contempt
that
is
whether
or
not
there
was
disobedience
for
the
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
to
decide
whether
there's
been
a
disobedience
to
the
order,
don't
perhaps
decide
whether
the
features
of
the
order
alleged
to
have
been
disobeyed
or
valid
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
scope
of
the
actual
review
on
certiorari
and
a
civil
contempt
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
--
anyone
reading
the
alabama
cases
and
finding
that
in
fact
on
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
review
of
civil
contempt
order
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
actually
inquires
into
the
validity
of
the
order
alleged
to
have
been
disobeyed.
will
he
not
think
that
that
was
an
appropriate
--
he
might
appropriately
believe
that
the
next
time
he
came
up
by
certiorari
not
only
with
the
contempt
itself
whether
there's
been
a
disobedience
but
as
well
whether
or
not
what
was
disobeyed
was
valid
would
be
considered
by
your
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
frankly,
what
i'm
addressing
myself
to,
i
notice
that
you
have
--
your
supreme
court
had
a
per
curiam
which
is
in
91
so.
2d
221.
at
the
time
there
was
an
application
for
stay
in
the
supreme
court,
i
think
that
was
the
application
of
july
31st,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
just
the
point
but
the
way
the
per
curiam
reads
this,
it
is
the
established
rule
of
this
court
that
the
proper
method
of
reviewing
a
judgment
for
civil
contempt
to
the
kind
here
involved
is
by
a
petition
for
common
law
writ
of
certiorari.
and
this
court
as
through
the
years
upheld
to
grant
the
writ
for
the
purposes
of
review
where
a
reasonable
ground
for
its
issuance
is
properly
presented
in
such
petition.
and
it
was
after
that
decision
and
that
per
curiam
that
the
first
petition
for
certiorari,
i
see
it's
all
on
the
same
page,
on
august
13
rather
cryptically
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
the
insufficient
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
the
writ,
the
averments
of
the
petitioner
insufficient
as
to
say
in
what
respect
insufficient.
and
then
it
was
followed
on
august,
the
petition
which
led
to
the
judgment
and
opinion
before
us
and
i'm
just
was
wondering
how
anyone
was
involved
in
this
very
case.
if
reading
your
cases
before
this
one
felt
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
review
both
of
the
underlying
order
as
well
as
of
the
contempt
itself.
i
could
help
but
take
this
as
an
instruction
of
your
supreme
court,
go
ahead
and
follow
the
root
of
writ
of
certiorari
and
we
will
consider
both
the
contempt
and
the
order
upon
which
it
would
take.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can't
find
any
in
the
record,
any
of
these
papers
that
underlay
either
those
application.
are
they
in
this
record,
do
you
know
mr.
rinehart?
are
they
not
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
filed
with
this
court,
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
these
underlying
papers
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that's
the
petition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rinehart,
do
you
suppose,
i
don't
know
if
it's
appropriate
or
not.
you
tell
if
me
if
you
don't
think
so,
if
you
don't
believe
it
is.
could
we
have
--
provided
us
the
record
and
all
of
these
applications
to
your
supreme
court,
the
petitions
that
were
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
--
as
i
understand,
the
only
one
we
have
here
is
a
petition
which
was
filed
on
the
20th
of
august.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
apparently
there
was
a
petition
filed
somewhere
on
august
the
13th
which
we
do
not
have
and
as
to
which
your
court
--
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
averments
were
insufficient.
then
before
that
on
july
31,
there
must
have
been
some
kind
of
paper
filed
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
stay
and
we
don't
have
that
paper
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
that
from
the
file
in
the
clerk's
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
say
about
their
membership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
there
decision
of
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
carter,
are
you
suggesting
that
dickens,
wheeler,
blakey,
boscowitz,
sellers
and
morris
support
your
position,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
are
the
ones
you
rely
on
particularly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
armstrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
said
the
affirmance,
as
i
read
it,
were
sufficient
so
that
it
might
be
considered
as
a
petition
for
certiorari.
