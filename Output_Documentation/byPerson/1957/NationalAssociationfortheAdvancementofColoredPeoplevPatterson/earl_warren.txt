chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rinehart,
if
--
if
a
corporation
is
delinquent
in
complying
with
law,
is
there
any
authority
of
anyone
in
the
state
to
prohibit
them
from
complying
with
the
law
when
they
are
--
was
called
to
their
attention?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
authority?
we
--
yes.
we
think
--
we
think
the
authority
can
be
found
in
state
ex
rel
griffith
against
knights
and
the
ku
klux
klan,
a
kansas
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
a
kansas
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
i
am
getting
at
is
this.
has
it
ever
been
declared
to
be
the
law
of
alabama
that
anybody
in
the
state
can
--
can
prevent
them
from
complying
merely
because
they
were
delinquent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
case
or
statutory
law.
well
now,
then
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
to
--
to
what
laws
we
--
we
have
and
i
notice
here
that
--
that
the
--
on
page
35
of
the
brief
for
our
petitioner
that
you
just
called
our
attention
to
that
there
are
certain
penalties
prescribed
for
not
complying
and
for
doing
business
without
complying.
if
that
is
true
and
the
state
has
set
those
penalties
and
there
is
no
other
statutory
law
or
no
--
no
judicial
law,
aren't
those
the
only
penalties
that
you
should
be
looking
at
exactly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
think
you
might
as
well
answer
that
in
the
morning.
we'll
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
adjourn.

justice

warren
number
91,
national
association
for
the
advance
of
colored
people,
petitioner,
versus
state
of
alabama.
mr.
patterson
or
mr.
rinehart,
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
was
thinking
about
mr.
rinehart
was
whether
it
has
a
penalty
for
having
--
having
been
delinquent
in
that
query.
there
was
any
authority
in
anyone
to
say
to
that
corporation
that
you
cannot
now
qualify.
i
consider
there
will
be
many
number
of
penalties
that
might
attach
to
it
but
is
there
such
a
penalty
as
a
denial
of
the
right
to
register
because
of
the
delinquency
in
registering
beforehand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
rinehart,
doesn't
next
paragraph
though
bear
on
that?
