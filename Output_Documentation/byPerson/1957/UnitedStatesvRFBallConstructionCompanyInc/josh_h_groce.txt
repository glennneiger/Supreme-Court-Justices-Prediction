mr.
josh
h.
groce
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
--
he
states
that
--
counsel
stated
that
the
surety
was
urging
this
interpleader
thing.
actually,
i
am
forced
to
argue
something
in
which,
i
am
not
at
all
interested
by
virtue
of
the
court's
rule,
but
i
will
have
to
argue
the
interpleader
side,
because
the
court
would
not
allow
division
argument.
the
interpleader
is
the
one
who
is
interested
in
the
interpleader's
fee
and
not
--
by
not
the
surety
company.
the
surety
is
--
concedes
that
the
interpleader
should
be
entitled
to
its
plea.
the
question
here
is
in
connection
with
the
interpleader
plea
is
where
the
sovereign
seeks
the
benefits
of
an
interpleader
action.
can
that
sovereign
escape
the
burdens
of
that?
here,
it's
undisputed
as
to
ball's
position
in
this
matter.
it
had
in
his
hands
some
13
odd
thousand
dollars
of
money
that
the
government
was
claiming.
the
surety
was
claiming,
materialmen
were
claiming,
it
could
not
be
safe
to
itself
determine
whom
--
to
whom
to
pay
that
fund.so,
it
interpleaded
the
fund
and
it
stipulated
that
a
$500
interpleader
fee
would
be
reasonable
in
the
case.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
it
stipulated
that
a
$500
fee
would
be
reasonable
if
allowable
under
the
law.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
the
government
did,
government
so
stipulated,
yes,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
they
are
contending,
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
liverpool
case,
he
spoke
of
it
as
the
scoville
case,
it's
the
liverpool
case,
your
honor.
they
say
that
the
liverpool
case
forecloses
that.
well,
that
is
not
the
case.
i
have
here
the
briefs
of
the
government
in
the
liverpool
case.
the
government
in
that
case
insisted
that
that
was
not
an
interpleader
action,
it
was
a
garnishment
action
controlled
by
rule
677
of
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure.
this
court
followed
them
and
there
was
not
one
thing
said
about
an
interpleader's
fee
whatsoever.
that
cost
would
be
taxed
according
to
rule
677,
which
is
the
garnishment
rule
in
texas.
now
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
that's
exactly
what
have
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
so
far
as
i
know,
this
court
has
never
passed
on
that
question.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir.
not
--
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
sir?
no,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
it
is
not.
the
federal
interpleader
statute
is
not
a
statute,
it
--
well,
it
is
a
statute,
but
the
attorney's
fees
that
are
allowable
is
not
mentioned
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
oh
yes.
that
is
correct,
but
not
--
not
the
matter
of
attorney's
fees.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
now,
this
court
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
the
interpleader
asked
for
five
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
left
--
left
that
to
the
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
--
to
the
inferential
powers
of
the
courts.
now,
this
court
followed
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
what
to
do
--
what
the
lower
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir,
there
are
four.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
nothing
in
--
there
are
four
--
four
cases
in
the
lower
court,
but
this
--
this
particular
case
being
two
of
them
once
in
the
trial
court
and
once
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
but
the
ellman
case
and
the
american
airlines
insurance
case,
that
is
the
decision
from
the
missouri
court
in
299
south
western
second
which
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
and
there
the
missouri
court
said,
that
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
sir?
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
what's
involved
in
--
on
the
question
and
is
discussing
federal
law.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
the
circuit
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
the
circuit
court
in
this
case
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
--
is
the
first
--
is
the
first
circuit
court
to
pass
upon
the
question.
there
are
these
other
cases
that
i
will
refer
to.
in
that
case,
the
missouri
court
said,
“the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
many
times
held
that
where
the
sovereign
invokes
the
aid
of
a
court,
it
must
submit
to
the
applications
of
the
same
principles
which
govern
private
suitors
citing
many
authorities
from
this
court.
any
other
rule
would
be
unconscionable
and
we,
to
use
our
courts,
free
from
the
obligation
to
abide
by
the
rule
which
binds
other
litigants.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
sorry
i
am
arguing
in
another
lawyer's
point.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
i
--
i
am
--
i
can't
say
that
i
have
exhausted
the
authorities.
i'm
merely
arguing
as
the
other
lawyer
asked
me
to
argue.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
[laughs]
except
that
i
have
--
had
to
resume
this
responsibility.
the
next
case
is
the
ellman
case
which
we
--
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
interpleader.
and
there
it's
--
there
the
trial
court
said,
“there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute,”
that's
the
interpleader
statute,
which
would
warrant
the
court
in
penalizing
an
innocent
stakeholder
simply
because
the
united
states
happens
to
be
a
party
to
a
litigation,
it
hold
it
holy
as
contended
for
by
the
government
would
engraft
by
decisional
law
a
purpose
in
favor
of
the
united
states,
not
specifically
provided
for
by
congress
and
unwarranted
on
equitable
principles.
now,
will
this
court?
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir,
i
would
--
that
sounds
--
sounds
fairly
reasonable
to
me,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
not
in
an
interpleader
action,
your
honor.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
and
there
is
that
congress
passed
the
interpleader
statute
and
it
made
no
specific
exceptions
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned
and
at
a
time
when
in
all
times,
the
interpleader
who
was
an
innocent
stake
holder
was
entitled
to
his
fees
that
he
should
not
be
penalized
just
because
the
government
was
a
party
to
the
--
party
to
the
suit.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
i
would
like
too,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
[laughs]
thank
you.
the
question
with
reference
to
the
principle
element
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not,
prior
contract
rights
may
be
destroyed
by
subsequently
file
tax
liens.
now,
in
order
to
get
to
that,
let's
get
a
brief
resume
of
what
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
are.
on
june
the
26th,
1951,
a
contract
for
the
construction
of
a
housing
project
of
over
three-and-a-half
million
dollars
was
left
by
the
san
antonio
housing
authority
to
r.f.
ball
construction
company.
r.f.
ball
construction
company
was
desirous
of
subcontracting
the
painting
and
the
interior
decorating,
which
he
entered
into
a
contract
with
jacobs
for
approximately
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
for
that.
jacobs
then
was
required
to
put
up
a
platform
performance-bond.
and
he
applied
to
the
united
pacific
insurance
company
for
this
performance-bond.
and
in
consideration
of
them
executing
this
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
bond,
he
read
--
he
assigned
to
the
united
pacific
insurance
company
all
of
the
retained
percentages
on
that
job,
your
honors
are
familiar
with
the
---
where
a
construction
contract
where
10%
is
withheld
each
month
from
the
amounts
that
are
paid
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
time,
there
would
be
that
sum
for
the
protection.
those
retained
percentages
on
the
job
were
assigned
in
the
following
language
to
the
bonding
company.
that
jacobs
does
assign,
transfer,
and
convey
as
of
this
date
as
collateral
security
for
the
payment
of
any
other
indebtedness
or
liability
of
jacobs
to
the
company
whether
heretofore
or
hereafter
incurred.
now,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
transaction?
i
believe
justice
whittaker
calls
attention
that
that
is
an
everyday
business
transaction.
it's
done
everyday.
it's
a
perfectly
legitimate
and
valid
transaction
whereby
the
bonding
company
can
procure
some
security.
yes
sir?
mr.
josh
h.
groce
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
all
right.
there
were
no
taxes
even
due
at
that
time.
none
of
the
taxes
that
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
collect
were
even
due
at
that
time,
or
had
accrued.
now,
some
nine
months
later,
the
surety
incurred
an
additional
liability
on
the
kentucky
contract,
which
under
the
law
and
by
contract,
jacobs
was
obligated
to
indemnify
the
surety
against
loss
on
that
job.
but
that
was
a
present
obligation
incurred
by
the
surety
on
april
the
4th,
1952.
and
it
was
a
present
obligation
to
pay
subject
only
to
be
defeated
or
nullified
by
the
performance
of
the
principle
which
the
principle
never
did.
and
whether
what
--
what
--
is
anything
wrong
with
that
transaction?
now,
here
we
have
the
surety
company
with
the
retained
percentages
at
that
time
and
mind
you,
the
san
antonio
job
had
been
going
on
for
some
nine
months
and
presumably
their
retained
percentages
have
been
retained
every
month
and
that
there
was
money
on
hand.
at
that
time
of
the
execution
of
the
kentucky
contract,
you
have
a
situation
where
there
are
certain
funds
supposed
the
san
antonio
job
had
already
been
completed
and
this
$13,000
was
there.
and
suppose
immediately
the
kentucky
contract
went
sour
and
the
bonding
company
had
to
take
over
at
a
lost
of
the
$13,000.
could
it
be
said
for
a
moment
that
the
bonding
company
wasn't
secured
by
that
assignment
of
those
--
of
those
retained
percentages?
well,
of
course
it
could.
now,
what
is
the
next
step
in
the
picture?
the
next
step
in
the
picture
is
that
on
april
the
30th,
1953,
the
housing
authority
in
san
antonio
accepted
the
work
of
ball,
the
general
contractor
which
showed
that
all
work,
including
jacobs'
work
of
painting
and
interior
decorating
had
been
completed.
now,
just
how
long
before
that
had
been
completed?
it's
not
in
the
record
but
i
assume
that
jacobs'
work
had
been
completed
for
some
time
because
it
was
the
painting
and
the
interior
decorating
and
not
landscaping
which
is
the
last
thing
on
the
job.
still,
up
to
the
--
and
on
april
the
30th,
it
was
agreed
that
on
this
jacobs'
contract,
there
were
$13,228
of
retained
percentages.
all
right,
what
do
you
have
there?
there's
still,
not
one
single
tax
lien
has
been
filed.
and
mind
you,
that
is
against
mortgagees,
pledgees,
purchasers,
a
tax
lien
is
not
valid
until
it
has
been
filed,
and
not
one
single
--
single
cent
of
a
tax
lien
has
been
filed
at
that
time.
there's
still
no
notice
of
--
notice
of
a
tax
lien.
the
surety
now,
what
was
the
situation
now?
the
surety
was
obligated
on
its
$36,000
kentucky
contract
bond,
and
it
had
as
collateral
security
to
protect
the
assignment
of
$13,000
which
was
in
the
hands
of
ball.
now,
thereafter,
in
may,
june,
and
september
of
1953
for
the
first
time
notices
of
tax
liens
were
filed
in
accordance
with
3672.
now,
when
the
first
default
on
the
kentucky
contract
took
place
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
sir?
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir.
the
taxes
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
either
of
these
two
jobs.
yes.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
all
right,
sir.
let
us
say,
when
the
first
default
to
be
stipulated
here,
it
is
that
the
parties
made
no
stipulation
as
to
where
these
taxes
came
from.
let's
put
it
that
way
so
that
they
--
the
government
does
not
claim
that
they
were
taxes
due
on
this
particular
job
and
the
bond
--
the
government
does
not
claim
that
the
bonding
company
owes
the
taxes.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
the
government
has
tried
often
hard
to
make
the
bonding
company
pay
these
taxes
but
they
--
been
the
surety
companies
have
been
successful
so
far.
let
us
say,
just
when
the
first
default
on
the
kentucky
contract
took
place,
it's
not
in
the
record.
but
mind
you,
on
this
obligation
which
the
bonding
company
surety
assumed
in
april
--
on
april
the
4rth,
1952.
it
was
required
to
pay.
it
didn't
voluntarily
pay,
but
it
was
required
to
pay
during
december
of
1953
and
march
of
1954,
the
sum
of
$12,900
and
whatever
--
whatever
it
is.
now,
this
--
it
was
required
to
pay
that
and
it
was
based
upon
that
present
obligation,
it
was
not
an
open-end
mortgage
at
all.
and
what
is
the
legal?
then
now,
so,
let's
go
back.
now
what
is
the
legal
effect
of
this
assignment
that
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
i
used
the
term
“open-end”
mortgage,
your
honor,
to
mean
where
you
go
to
the
bank
and
make
an
assignment
in
consideration
of
the
bank
advancing
new
moneys
over
a
period
of
time.
under
the
phillips
case,
where
the
bank
does
that
and
is
under
no
obligation
to
pay
to
--
the
lien
to
the
money
--
the
federal
tax
lien
comes
in
and
cuts
off
the
bank's
right
to
give
you
any
further
--
i
make
use
of
any
further
loans,
now
that
is
what
is
known
as
an
open-end
mortgage
in
the
way
i
used
it.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
[laughs]
all
right.
all
right,
sir.
what
is
--
what
was
the
effect
of
this
assignment
as
collateral
security?
well,
obviously,
it's
either
one,
a
mortgage
or
a
pledge,
or
two,
it's
an
outright
assignment.
now,
if
it
was
a
mortgage
or
a
pledge,
then
on
the
3672,
it
being
prior
in
time,
it
is
prior
in
length.
it's
a
--
if
it
is
an
outright
assignment,
then
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
tax
liens,
jacobs,
under
3670,
had
no
property
or
rights
to
property
in
the
fund
to
which
the
tax
lien
could
apply.
the
texas
law
which
created
these
and
this
is
the
law
that
prevailed.i
believe,
your
honor,
asked
what
law
prevails
on
that.
this
court
in
the
case
of
morgan
versus
the
commissioner,
309
u.s.
held
that
unequivocally
on
a
very
recent
case
from
new
york
based
upon
that,
held
the
same
thing,
that
its
state
law,
the
court
explains,
creates
legal
interest
and
rights.
the
federal
revenue
act
designate
what
rights
or
interest
so
created
shall
be
so
taxed.
so,
under
the
texas
law,
what
is
the
effect
of
this
assignment?
i
read
from
the
texas
case
of
southern
surety
company
versus
bering.
when
this,
as
a
part
of
the
consideration
for
the
execution
of
the
surety
bond
by
the
appellant
surety
company
conveyed
and
assigned
under
said
surety
company
as
security
for
indebtedness,
then
due
by
him
to
the
company
and
any
subsequent
indebtedness
which
he
might
incur
to
it,
any
and
all
payments.
funds,
moneys
or
property
due
are
to
become
due
to
him
under
his
building
contract
with
the
press
company,
he
is
thereby
assigned
the
bond
in
question
in
this
case,
the
validity
of
the
assignment
is
in
no
way
affected
by
the
fact
that
there
was
no
bond
in
actual
existence
at
the
time
that
it
was
made.
now,
that's
the
texas
law
that
this
court
said
that
must
be
applied.
as
early
as
150
years
ago,
this
court,
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
john
marshall
in
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
coy,
upheld
what
is
known
in
law
as
indemnity
mortgages.
there,
a
deed
has
been
made
to
one
coy
by
one
fitzgerald
who
was
a
public
servant
of
the
united
states
government
to
secure
coy
from
any
liability
that
he
might
have
--
might
have
to
pay
by
virtue
of
his
security
to
the
united
states
government.
in
consideration
of
the
payment
--
well,
here
is
what
this
court
said.
the
deed
is
made
to
save
coy
harmless
on
account
of
his
having
become
surety
of
fitzgerald
to
the
united
states.
all
the
covenants
in
the
deed
appeared
to
the
court
to
be
fair,
legitimate
and
consistent
with
common
usage.
that
is
--
that
has
been
the
law
of
this
court
for
more
than
150
years.
the
law
of
texas
though
is
the
one
that
prevails
so
we
cite
the
supreme
court
of
texas
on
an
indemnity
mortgage
where
it
says
the
same
thing.
the
desire
to
indemnify
a
security
against
loss
was
a
sufficient
consideration
for
the
execution
of
the
mortgages.
now
here
is
what
corpus
juris
says
with
reference
to
indemnity
mortgages.
it
is
well
settled
that
a
mortgage
given
by
way
of
indemnity,
that
is
not
found
on
the
present
debt
but
meant
to
secure
the
mortgagee
against
loss
or
damage
in
consequence
of
any
contingent
liability
or
responsibility
which
he
has
assumed
or
agreed
to
assume
for
or
on
behalf
of
mortgagor
and
surety
as
bail,
endorsed
or
otherwise
is
valid
and
be
enforceable.
an
indemnity
mortgage
maybe
given
to
secure
the
mortgagee
not
only
as
against
debts
or
liabilities
for
which
he
has
already
assumed
responsibility
or
liability
but
also
to
protect
him
against
loss
or
damage
on
endorsement,
suretyships,
or
other
liabilities
which
he
may
in
the
future
entered
into
for
the
benefit
of
the
mortgagor.
now,
when
congress
used
the
term
that
a
federal
tax
lien
should
not
be
valid
as
against
any
mortgagee,
pledgee,
or
purchaser,
any
mortgagee
which
is
prior
in
time,
what
does
it
mean?
does
it
mean
nor
we
are
eliminating
indemnity
mortgages
from
that
--
that
category
of
any
mortgagee.
no,
we're
going
to
eliminate
that,
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
--
what
the
government
in
this
case
is
contending
in
this
court.
now
of
course,
it
could
be
said
to
be
a
pledgee
in
this
case
because
it
is
--
it
is
cash,
you
might
say,
because
these
retained
percentages
have
been
referred
to
in
by
the
decisions
as
just
so
much
--
like
so
much
liberty
bonds.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
that's
--
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
they
come
back
and
say
it
can't
be
a
pledge
because
there
was
no
transfer
of
the
possession.
well,
of
course,
there
couldn't
have
been
any
transfer
of
possession
because
the
pledgor
didn't
have
possession
to
begin
with.
the
--
the
possession
was
in
the
--
in
r.f.
ball
construction
company.
but
even
if
this
assignment
as
collateral
security
is
not
a
mortgage
or
a
pledge,
it
was
still
an
assignment.
and
under
the
texas
law,
that's
southern
surety
case
versus
bering
manufacturing
company
that
i
quoted
for
you
just
a
moment
ago,
as
well
as
numerous
federal
decisions
including
several
decisions
of
this
court,
salem
trust
company
versus
manufacturers'
trust
--
finance
company,
conard
versus
insurance
company,
u.s.
versus
kaufman,
harrison
versus
terry,
brent
versus
the
bank
of
washington.
after
jacobs
made
the
assignment,
he
no
longer
had
any
property
or
rights
to
property
in
this
fund
to
which
the
lien,
the
tax
lien
could
apply
under
3670,
because
the
3670
says
that
the
lien
shall
apply
only
to
property
or
rights
to
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer
and
subsequent
to
the
assignment,
he
had
no
such
--
no
such
interest.
the
government
would
say
that
these
principles
that
are
of
the
scoville,
the
avery
case,
the
new
britain,
the
security
trust,
all
of
those
cases,
not
one
single
one
of
those
cases
had
to
do
with
contract
rights,
your
honors.
they
had
to
do
with
some
state
statutory
lien
such
as
a
water-rent
lien,
a
landlord's
lien,
an
attachment
lien,
a
garnishment
lien.
things
of
that
sort
which
sought
to
come
in
under
the
term
of
judgment
creditor.
not
mortgagee,
pledgee,
or
purchaser,
but
judgement
creditor
and
they
have
not
ripened
into.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
oh
yes,
sir.
not
that
i
think
that
congress
intended
that
it
had
to
ripen
because
after
all
no
mortgage
is
coy
if
you
want
to
use
the
word
coy
in
the
sense
that
it's
complete
until
after
it
has
been
foreclosed,
because
you
don't
know
how
much
interest
is
going
to
be
due,
you
don't
know
how
whether
the
mortgagors
are
going
to
pay
part
of
it,
you
don't
know
whether
--
whether
attorney's
fees
are
going
to
be
added
to
it
by
people
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
oh
no,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
new
britain
was
a
mechanics
lien
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
oh,
there
were
so
many
other
things
that
had
to
be
done
in
order
to
perfect
the
lien.
oh,
yes,
there
were
many
things
that
had
to
be
done
to
perfect
that
lien
that
had
not
been
done.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
sir?
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
i
--
i
think
your
honor
is
wrong.
i'm
not
sure
but
i
think
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
[laughs]
there's
a
sequel
to
that.
i
see
that
430
is
here
so
--
mr.
josh
h.
groce
thank
you,
sir.
the
government
says
that
the
liability
of
the
surety
arose
subsequent
to
the
state
that
these
liens
were
filed.
now,
that
is
sheer
sophistry.
the
liability
of
the
surety
when
it
executed
this
bond
on
april
the
4th,
1953,
was
fixed
at
that
time.
now
it's
true
that
that
liability
was
not
discharged
until
after
the
fixing
of
the
lien.
but
that,
when
they
paid
those
--
when
they
paid
off
that
claim,
they
had
no
alternative.
it
was
not
a
question
of
an
open-end
mortgage
because
here,
we
have
the
obligation
to
fight
and
we
had
relied
upon
our
security,
and
so
if
the
liability
was
fixed
as
of
april
--
of
april
the
4th,
1953
where
it's
more
than
a
year
after
that,
that
the
government
filed
their
--
filed
their
liens.
and
here,
the
government
states
something
about
the
doctrine
of
relation
back.
we're
not
contending
for
any
doctrine
of
relation
back.
the
doctrine
of
relation
back
is
an
equitable
doctrine.
we
claim
that
we
have
a
perfectly
valid
legal
mortgage
or
pledge
or
assignment.
and
we're
not
asking
for
the
court
to
apply
any
equitable
doctrine
of
relation
back
at
all.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir,
but
3670
says
it
must
--
it
must
be
property
belonging
to
and
if
he
has
already
assigned
it,
it
doesn't
belong
to
him.
that's
the
--
that's
my
argument
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
by
adding
the
alternative
an
assignment
out
of
him
which
divested
him
of
any
property
or
rights
to
property
in
the
fund,
one
or
the
other.
now
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
government
in
this
case
is
seeking
to
have
this
court
judicially
legislate
on
a
matter
that
congress
not
only
has
failed
to
legislate
on
but
has
specifically
refused
to
legislate
on.
i
have
attached
to
my
brief
the
report
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee.
in
1954,
congress
was
in
the
process
of
completely
revamping
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
ways
and
means
committee,
their
first
report
was
to
come
in
and
spell
out
3672
and
did
it
find
just
who
was
a
mortgagee
pledgee
or
purchaser.
but,
it
went
then
to
the
senate
finance
committee
and
i
have
the
report
of
the
senate
finance
committee.
and
the
senate
finance
committee
says,
“no,
we
are
satisfied
with
the
then
court
decisions
construing
who
is
a
mortgagee
or
a
pledge
or
a
pledgee
by
the
actualities
rather
than
by
nomenclature
or
some
theoretical
way.”
the
courts
have
and
we've
cited
those
authorities
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
brief.
many
courts
have
passed
upon
the
trial
court
in
this
instance.
he
says
that
the
--
the
courts
do
not
decide
cases
on
nomenclature.
it's
true
that
the
parties
to
this
transaction
didn't
place
the
label
on
it
of
either
a
mortgage
or
a
pledge
but
as
the
trial
court
says
courts
do
not
decide
cases
on
nomenclatures,
they
look
to
the
substance
of
the
transaction.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
yes,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
not
now,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
no,
sir.
mr.
josh
h.
groce
the
--
there's
a
good
deal
of
history
and
i
thought
that
the
government
had
abandoned
any
question
with
reference
to
that.
they
did
not
brief
it.
they
did
not
put
it
on
certiorari
--
on
their
application
--
petition
for
certiorari,
and
i
assume
that
they
had
abandoned
it
but
counsel
did
say
something
about
not
recording
the
--
the
instrument.
there
was
a
statute
that
is
in
the
record
here
that
would
have
permitted
it
to
be
of
record
as
of
the
time
but
that
as
soon
as
that
--
a
decision
of
the
state
court
came
out,
the
legislature
immediately
knocked
that
out
and
said
“no,
it
did
not
apply
to
transactions
such
as
this
one.”
so
congress
then
refused
to
legislate
as
they're
asking
this
court
now
to
legislate.
thank
you
very
much.
