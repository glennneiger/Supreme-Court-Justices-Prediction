disqualification

justice

are
there
no
--
has
this
question
not
come
up
where
property
is
put
into
the
treasury
of
the
court
and
to
rule
about
it,
i
mean
the
interpleader
problem
or
the
surrender
of
property
in
which
the
government
claimed
an
interest
and
then
the
question
arises
whether
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
they're
being
advanced
before
the
court,
the
court
as
a
matter
of
conscious
can
deal
with
it
in
relation
to
the
funds?
justice

i
have
not
--
justice
felix

i
think,

justice
felix

what
are
the

the

anything,
“never

the

anything
about

and
fee
--
attorneys
fee?
justice
felix

the
interpleader
asks.
it's
done
by
presentation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
statute,
a
general
rule
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
inferential
power
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
lower
court
says
the
question
hasn't
arisen
whether
the
recent
court
and
the
united
states
has
a
claim
to
it
whether
then
it
is
to
be
treated
like
any
other
litigant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
asking
you
whether
there
had
been
no
adjudication
either
since
the
beginning
of
the
nations.
has
there
been
no
adjudications
in
the
lower

on
this
question
of
making
a
reasonable

and
wrote
upon
the
immunity
of
the
sovereign
against
from
being
charged
with
cost
of
fee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
difference.
for
instance,
there
are
english
cases
which
make
a
difference
of
this
sovereign
immunity
pursuit,
if
in
fact
there's
--
there
is
in
court,
then
the
court
can
make
this
position
even
though
the
sovereign
has
an
interest
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
is
there
nothing
in
the
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
are
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
state
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
state
case
and
i'll
be
glad
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
want
to
know
--
that
you'd
have
to
tell
us,
not
just
the
docket
at
least,
i
want
to
know
if
there
were
any
explicit
decisions
by
anybody
on
circuit
or
district
or
circuit
court
or
courts
of
appeals
to
date.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
there
something
on
this
under
western
may
by
mr.
justice
holmes?
a
case
called
the
western
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
in
the
envy
of
a
position
of
a
barrister.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
suggest,
speaking
to
you
in
behalf
of
your
legal
client,
may
i
suggest
that
that
--
that
if
there
is
a
strong
controlling
long
continued
statutory
policy
--
policy
expressed
in
legislation
by
congress,
that
becomes
not
irrelevant
in
determining
and
then
putting
this
court
whether
it
should
as
a
matter
of
decisional
law
go
against
such
a
policy
of
congress
or
should
respected
as
part
of
its
own
discretionary
determination
of
law
that
congress
has
decided.
that
--
that's
not
an
unknown
principle
of
judicial
consideration,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
1789,
congress
has
felt
that
uncle
sam
should
be
treated
as
to
these
matters.
as
a
--
i
don't
mean
in
this
kind
of
a
case
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
this
right
--
this
is
--
this
right
more
than
--
than
the
interest
of
new
britain
in
the
new
britain
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
it
--
all
of
it
was
to
new
britain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
what
more
--
in
what
sense
was
that
in
coy
in
the
sense
in
which
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
had
been
(inaudible)
about
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
in
the
(inaudible)
about
and
foreclosed
the
interest
of
the
city.
that's
all
as
i
remember
new
britain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
think
--
i'm
with
you
on
new
britain
because
i
didn't
like
that
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
district
court
of
appeals
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
that
up
(inaudible)
you
give
it
to
the
clerk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
read
the
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
can
state
on
what
page.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
name
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
us
the
spelling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
importance
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
