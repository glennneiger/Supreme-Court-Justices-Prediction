mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
stipulated
that
the
sum
impleaded
in
this
case
is
a
balance
to
--
from
the
r.f.
ball
construction
company
for
--
to
the
taxpayer
for
having
completed
a
contract
in
san
antonio,
texas.
the
first
question
presented
is
the
relative
priority
of
federal
tax
liens
in
this
fund
and
those
of
claims
made
by
the
surety
under
the
texas
contract
for
payments
that
was
required
to
make
in
an
entirely
separate
contract
under
which
the
taxpayer
defaulted
in
kentucky.
the
court
below
has
held
that
the
application
of
the
--
which
was
executed
by
the
partnership
with
predecessor
of
the
taxpayer
corporation
where
the
mortgage
within
the
meaning
of
section
3672
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code.
that
statute,
insofar
as
pertinent
here,
provides
that
no
federal
tax
liens
shall
be
valid
against
the
purchaser,
mortgagee,
pledgee,
or
judgment
creditor.
the
statute
was
enacted
to
protect
the
public
from
secret
federal
tax
liens.
the
application
which
the
court
below
held
made
the
surety,
a
mortgagee
provided
that
the
partnership
had
transferred
and
conveyed
as
of
this
date,
that's
the
date
of
the
texas
contract
to
the
surety
all
right,
title
and
interest
of
the
undersigned
to
all
percentages
and
all
of
the
sums
which
would
come
to,
to
the
undersigned
as
collateral,
security
of
the
full
performance
of
the
texas
contract
which
was
performed,
and
the
payment
of
any
other
indebtedness
or
liability
to
the
undersigned
into
the
company
whether
heretofore
or
hereafter
incurred.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
we
have
made
a
search,
if
the
court
please,
of
the
textbooks
and
of
the
decisions
of
the
states
that
its
default
and
yet
the
--
any
other
indebtedness
or
liability,
when
it
appears
in
each
instrument,
the
courts
some
hold
that
there's
no
mortgage
at
all.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
i
trust
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
and
a
like
one
was
executed
late
--
late
application
was
executed
by
the
taxpayer
when
the
bonding
company
became
surety
on
the
kentucky
bonds.
this
contract
or
this
assignment
was
executed
in
july
of
1951.
a
few
months
afterwards,
the
partnership
was
incorporated
and
the
taxpayer
assumed
the
liabilities
and
took
all
of
its
assets.
about
nine
months
after
the
execution
of
this
instrument,
the
taxpayer
corporation
entered
into
the
kentucky
contract.
in
march
of
1952
--
1953,
the
first
government
lien
arose.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
six
thousand
and
some
dollars,
if
your
honor
please,
plus
interest.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
(inaudible)
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
yes,
sir,
there
were
two
other
liens.
on
april
the
30th,
1953,
the
work
of
the
r.f.
ball
construction
company
was
accepted
by
the
housing
authority
that
is
the
work
under
the
texas
contract.
between
that
period
and
the
date
upon
which
it
was
agreed
as
to
the
amount
that
the
two
--
the
taxpayers
under
the
texas
contract,
the
other
two
liens
arose
and
all
of
the
notices
were
filed.
it
was
not
until
december,
1953
between
december,
1953
and
march
of
1954
that
any
liability
arose
under
the
kentucky
contract
that
is
the
date
that
the
payments
were
made
by
the
surety
under
the
kentucky
contract
or
from
december,
1953
to
march
of
1954.
now,
the
real
question
in
this
case
seems
to
be
whether,
we
can
apply
or
we
ought
to
apply
the
principles
that
this
court
has
announced
in
connection
with
lien
cases
and
statutory
liens
of
all
types
to
a
contract.
there's
no
question
and
the
court
below
found
and
held
that
the
liability
of
the
surety
here
arose
subsequent
to
the
date
all
of
the
liens
were
filed.
yet,
distinguished
the
recent
decisions
to
this
case
and
surety
clauses,
the
(inaudible)
nor
the
lien
cases
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
question
of
statutory
lien
while
here,
the
liens
arose
out
of
contract.
however,
there
was
no
lien
at
the
time
that
the
government's
liens
were
filed.
the
surety
had
no
lien.
i
have
to
say
first
though
that
among
the
tax
writers,
they
all
say
this
is
a
contrariety
of
opinion
among
the
states
as
to
how
they
would
treat
mortgages
which
provide
for
future
advances
and
then
the
mortgages
which
were
treated
the
same.
they
do
state
and
i
think
that
this
is
in
connection
with
this
court's
admonition
that
the
taxing
statutes
ought
to
be
applied
uniformly
throughout
united
states
and
that
the
terms
used
in
section
3672
ought
to
be
used
in
there
or
to
be
construed
in
their
conventional
sense.
there
is
no
conventional
sense
among
the
decisions
as
to
the
treatment
of
this
type
of
mortgage.
the
case
cited
on
the
surety's
brief,
wright
against
voorhees,
an
iowa
case,
the
last
case
in
his
index
where
the
suit
brought
by
a
mortgagee
against
his
mortgagor
to
recover
two
losses.
he
had
pledged
a
security
for
loans
specified
and
paid.
the
mortgagee
defended
on
a
condition
which
included
any
other
indebtedness
similar
to
the
condition
here.
and
the
court
held
that
to
accept
the
mortgagee's
decision
would
convert
the
instrument
into
a
mere
blanket
mortgage
having
no
reference
to
the
subject
matter
referred
to
in
the
instrument,
and
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
mortgagor
was
affirmed.
now
most
of
the
states
hold
that
where
there's
an
open-end
mortgage,
here,
we
have
one
that's
sold
from
both
ends
and
first
i
should
perhaps
say
that
where
there
is
no
security
that
security
has
promised
which
the
court
hold
in
a
case
where
there
is
an
assignment
of
potential
gross
income
or
acquired
property.
the
lien,
if
it
did
exist,
attaches
to
the
act
that
acquires
property
when
acquired
but
under
the
statutes
relates
back
to
the
date
of
the
execution
of
the
instrument.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
the
--
the
3672
of
the
1939
code
determines
whether
it'll
have
the
status
and
preference
it
will
have
over
the
liens.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
federal
law,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
priority,
its
priority
over
a
federal
tax
lien.
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
it
is
always
a
federal
question
to
determine
the
type
of
adverse
lien
where
this
court
--
in
court
not
to
be
determined
by
state
laws.
if
--
if
there'd
be
some
questions
in
your
honors'
mind
on
the
question
of
an
interest
in
the
property,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
the
decision
new
york
against
maclay.
and
there
the
court
was
applying
the
priority
statute
provides
statutes
3466.
it
first
held
that
an
adverse
lien
of
the
state
was
in
court
and
then
questioned
the
correctness
of
the
so-called
mortgagee
cases.
and
referring
to
the
mortgagee
cases,
it
referred
to
the
regular
common
law
mortgage
as
distinguished
from
an
equitable
mortgage
and
it
indicated
there
the
possibility
or
perhaps
i
might
seem
to
say
the
likelihood
that
the
government
could
take
under
3466
ahead
of
the
mortgage,
a
common
law
mortgage.
evidently,
the
court
is
not
suggesting
that
you
could
take
other
people's
property.
here,
the
assignment
is
specifically
for
security.
now,
as
i
have
said,
the
question
really
is,
does
the
doctrine
of
relation
apply
against
the
united
states
in
a
contract
of
this
type
where
admittedly,
the
mortgagee,
as
he
calls
himself,
was
not
--
had
no
lien.
at
the
time
the
instrument
was
executed,
he
had
no
lien
and
certainly
no
court
lien
at
the
time
the
government's
first
lien
arose.
he
had
no
lien
that
he
could
enforce
at
the
time
our
notices
of
liens
were
filed.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
the
mortgages
and
lien
and
all
of
the
tax
writers
who
attempt
to
define
it,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
well,
i
think
not
--
i
don't
think
there's
such
a
suggestion
in
the
decision
below,
if
your
honor
please.
but
it
was
--
the
assignment
was
specifically
as
security,
that's
quoted
from
the
instrument.
and
we
start
from
there
and
find
that
we
have
no
lien
up
to
the
time
that
our
tax
liens
go
on.
that's
under
the
decisions
--
the
majority
decisions
of
the
states.
most
of
the
decisions
of
the
states
hold
that
they
had
no
lien,
but
they
say
that
when
the
lien
that
comes
to
court,
it
will
relate
back
to
the
date
of
the
execution
of
the
instrument.
there's
another
reason,
we
submit,
why
the
doctrine
of
relation
should
not
be
applied
against
the
united
states
in
mortgages,
where
a
subsequent
encumbrance
of
it
and
this
is
non-recorded
instrument.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
may
--
becomes
such
before
a
--
an
advance
which
is
filed
under
the
instrument
is
made.
he
taxed
ahead
in
--
on
the
motion
of
the
decisions,
some
of
them
none.
under
some
of
the
decisions
and
i
have
heard
in
connecticut
the
decision
of
this
court
which
was
connecticut
law,
the
--
the
mortgage,
he
doesn't
even
take
his
original
--
original
sum,
it's
$6000
in
that
case.
but
gives
way
took
a
subsequent
encumbrance
of
it.
it
seems
astounding,
if
the
court
please,
that
that
of
those
the
way
the
decisions
run
in
determining
the
effect
of
this
type
of
mortgage.
the
--
i'm
sorry
about
the
--
not
on
the
brief,
townsend
against
todd,
91
u.s.452.
in
addition,
it
was
contended
by
the
government
below
that
we
came
within
the
texas
statute
because
the
systems
have
not
been
recorded.
the
court
below
held
otherwise.
however,
the
fifth
circuit
has
already
held
in
another
case,
that
one
of
the
recording
statutes
and
under
one
of
the
recording
statutes
of
texas,
the
united
states
was
a
creditor,
and
as
a
creditor,
the
mortgage
unrecorded
was
not
valid.
if
the
government
cannot
either
look
to
the
state
statutes
which
would
not
give
uniformity
if
it
were
filed,
then
it
seems
this
court
or
the
federal
court
must
look
to
the
realities
if
this
mortgage
is
used
in
3672
is
to
be
uniformly
applied.
and
the
--
the
--
it
seems
not
unreasonable,
certainly,
that
congress
intended
by
mortgage
to
put
the
government
in
a
position
where
a
junior
creditor
could
not
--
a
credit
--
a
junior
mortgagee
that
is
one
junior
to
federal
tax
liens
could
obtain
upon
what
the
federal
government
could
not.
under
state
court
decisions,
many
of
them
or
most
of
them
will
say,
the
unrecorded
lien
of
this
type
or
an
innocent
take
of
the
value
would
come
between
those
two,
the
first
mortgage
and
the
second
mortgage,
that
the
second
mortgage,
in
attack
of
the
first
mortgage
and
united
states
cannot
unless
the
realities
of
the
situation
are
considered.
there
is
a
second
question
in
the
case
and
that
if
the
allowance
of
attorney's
fees
to
the
interpleader.
this
court
holds
in
scope
here,
we
think,
that
attorney's
fees
may
not
be
allowed
out
of
the
fund
upon
which
the
federal
government
has
tax
liens.
there
are
several
court
decisions
cited
on
the
government's
brief
which
are
in
accord
with
our
position,
the
ellman
case
was
distinguished
which
was
cited
by
the
taxpayer
or
the
surety
historically
and
by
the
court
below.
the
rules,
we
submit,
and
the
statutes
provide
that
no
cost
shall
be
assessed
against
the
united
states
unless
there
be
some
statutes
specifically
permitting
it.
there
is
no
such
statute
pointed
to
and
the
ellman
case
and
this
case
used
the
discretion,
equitable
discretion,
of
the
district
court
in
allowing
an
attorney's
fee
out
of
fund
to
which
the
federal
government
had
the
lien.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
may
it
please
the
court.
the
texas
statute
at
the
time
of
this
transaction
did
require
the
liquidation
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
the
liquidation
of
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
--
this
type
of
instrument.
it
was
substance
to
this
kind
after
it
was
amended.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
yes.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
i
mean,
an
indemnity
mortgage,
sir.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
an
instrument
that's
claimed
to
be
--
have
been
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
it
was
amended
effective
may
21,
1955,
provide
that
money
to
a
contractor
on
a
construction
contract
where
the
contractor
assignor
has
furnished
a
surety
bond
shall
not
be
included
in
it
the
definition
of
an
account
receivable.
that
statute
prior
to
that
amendment,
this
type
of
instrument
was
included
as
an
account
receivable
and
that
an
assignment
was
an
account
receivable
and
liquidation
was
essential
to
its
validity.
i
should
like
firstly
to
--
the
government
does
not
contend
that
a
valid
indemnity
mortgage
cannot
be
entered
into.
we
make
no
such
contention,
but
most
of
the
states
hold
that
you
must
set
forth
the
condition
contemplated
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
instrument
with
sufficient
particularity
that
it
--
and
some
of
them
say,
“gentlemen,
you
can
put
a
limit
upon
it.”
but
if
you
--
if
this
instrument
had
said
that
this
was
to
cover
the
liability
of
the
surety
under
the
kentucky
contract,
then
it
might
have
been
a
mortgage
within
the
rulings
of
the
states,
most
of
the
states,
they
are
not
in
court.
the
second
--
secondly,
most
that
states
hold
that
a
mortgage
is
to
secure
a
debt
and
without
a
debt,
it
has
no
effect
as
a
lien.
now
there
was
no
debt
here
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
liens
were
on
before
the
potential
liability
of
the
surety
became
an
actual
liability.
the
liens
were
filed,
have
been
filed.
the
voluntary
advances
take
ahead
of
future
encumbrances
only
if
the
advances
be
prior
in
time
to
the
encumbrance.
this
is
what
most
of
the
states
hold.
and
where
a
mortgagee
is
bound
to
make
future
advances
or
indemnifies
then
up
to
the
amount
fixed
in
the
mortgage,
all
for
that
indemnity
specified
the
lien
for
such
advances
relates
back
to
the
date
of
the
mortgage
and
it's
superior
to
subsequent
liens.
that
is
where
there
is
a
specified
indemnity
in
the
instrument
or
it
is
set
forth
limited
in
amount.
here,
there's
no
limited
amount.
if
this
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
i
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
no,
sir,
i
don't
mean
that.
the
condition
of
the
instrument
must
be
set
aside.
there's
nothing
in
this
instrument
that
specifies
--
it
has
to
do
with
this
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
that
was
the
amount
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
that
was
the
date
that
it
was
determined
that
an
amount
was
due
that
is
the
date
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
--
that
was
accepted.
no,
sir.
actually,
the
date
that
that
was
determined
was
in
october
of
1953
as
of
that
date,
and
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
yes,
that's
--
no
the
amount
due
to
the
taxpayer,
sir.
if
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
yes,
sir.
the
amount
due
to
the
taxpayer
was
agreed
to
between
the
taxpayer
and
r.f.
ball
construction
company
in
october
of
1953
after
all
of
our
liens
on.
the
acceptance
of
the
housing
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
that's
what
my
learned
opponent
here
made
a
mistake
when
he
said
so.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
may
i
read
that,
the
--
from
the
opinion
of
court

true.

sir.
there

a
case
--
i

--

find
it.
i
should
like
to
--
well,
how
could
i
cite
it
to
the
court,
may
i
make
another
list
of
applications
and
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
--
and
to
call
the
court's
attention?
what
date
was
that
decided?
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
you
have
it
then?
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
yes,
sir.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
we
don't
have
it
yet,
sir.
it's
a
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
i
have
the
opinion
here.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
that
was
under
review
by
publication,
we
don't
think
it
has
(inaudible)
your
honor.
it's
been
passed
a
couple
of
weeks.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
three
weeks.
it's
aquilino.
it's
robert
aquilino
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
a-q-u-i-l-i-n-o
and
another
copartnership,
et
cetera,
against
the
united
states
and
others.
that's
a
--
that
is
the
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
sir,
which
is
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
itself
on
former
decisions.
in
a
case
involving
the
balance
due
on
a
municipal
contract
under
new
york
statutes,
the
balance
due
on
such
contract
is
to
be
treated
as
a
trust
fund
for
the
payment
of
the
--
(inaudible)
--
and
may
i
just
leave
in
part
of
that
--
the
court
said
and
then
i'll
--
that
runs
pretty
close,
we
say,
to
contracts,
we
submit.
it
says
--
i
mean
that
court
said
in
reversing
its
former
decisions,
it
is
now
exceedingly
well-settled
that
no
state
created
rule
may
defeat
the
paramount
right
of
the
united
states
to
levy
and
collect
its
taxes
uniformly
throughout
the
land.
well,
that
is
said
in
connection
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
oh
no,
sir.
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
oh
no,
sir.
that
--
that
is
important
--
mr.
alexander
f.
prescott
thank
you
sir.
also
because
the
fact
that
it's
in
court
where
the
united
states
against
kings
county
which
is
a
second
circuit
decision.
