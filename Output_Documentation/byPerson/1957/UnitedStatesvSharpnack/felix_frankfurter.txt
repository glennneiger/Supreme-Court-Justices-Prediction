justice

frankfurter
what
is
the
provision
in
the
constitution
either
expressed
or
implied
on
which
you
rely
saying
that
congress
cannot
legislate
in
this
way?
cannot
say,
"we
now
legislate"
that
in
view
of
the
existing
enactment
of
state
law
in
this
old
times
either
lightening
the
sentences
or
stiffening
sentences
or
new
conditions
bringing
new
situations.
we
now
legislate
and
put
our
authority
behind
the
obstruction
of
what
the
state
--
what
is
there
--
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
follows
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
hang
it
onto
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
a
correct
statement
of
what
happened,
really
because
texas
wants
something
to
be
a
crime.
because
the
congress
of
the
united
states
facing
actuality
says
that
we
now
announce
that
whenever
that
which
on
a
place
which
is
part
of
texas
for
all
practical
reasons
but
jurisdictionally
belongs
to
the
united
states
could
be
treated
the
way
texas
--
all
other
parts
of
texas
had
been
re-legislate
there.
they
didn't
say
we'd
leave
it
all
to
texas.
they
put
their
will
behind
it.
the
president,
if
he
doesn't
like
that,
he
can
veto
it.
if
the
president
--
if
congress
had
signed
it
and
the
president
haven't
vetoed
it
or
his
veto
is
overwritten,
i
don't
know
which
would
be
true
in
this
case,
and
it's
just
as
much
a
law
as
that
which
says
that
tomorrow
something
shall
be
a
crime
on
--
the
concern
with
exclusively
federal
matters.
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
in
texas,
that
is
half
the
statement.
texas
cannot
do
it
without
the
most
solemn
determination
of
the
legislative
and
executive
process
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
itself
constantly
--
not
constantly
but
fairly
--
certainly
you
--
way
back
from
the
(inaudible)
made
legislation
contingent
on
something
that
wasn't
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
agree
that
there's
a
difference.
what
i
want
to
know
--
what
is
the
constitutional
difference
between
the
exercise
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
congress
that
that's
the
way
it
wants
to
legislate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
it?
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
meaningless
when
congress
does
this?
would
it
just
be
nothing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
did
do
something
on
a
day
on
which
you
couldn't
tell
what
the
circumstances
are
that
will
affect
people's
rights.
it
all
looked
to
the
future
and
the
future
may
have
--
they
just
said
in
advance
that
when
something
happens
in
the
future,
this
is
the
consequence.
now,
i
well
understand
the
difference
between
civil
and
criminal
cases.
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
the
differences
so
far
as
exercising
the
legislative
power
which
article
1
of
the
constitution
gives
to
the
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
congress
could
do
a
lot
of
things.
congress
could
remit
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases
to
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
whole
--
then
you
have
the
same
result
by
a
wholesale
in
futuro
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
there
are
reasons
why
congress
saw
fit
that
when
things
happened
on
west
point
as
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
not
under
a
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
you
to
another
bearing
(inaudible)
suppose
congress
seeding
jurisdiction
to
the
states
for
all
criminal
--
for
all
acts
committed
on
federal
territory
that
it
would
be
a
crime
under
state
law,
subject
to
state
jurisdiction.
it
has
provided,
however,
that
the
defendant
if
he
so
chooses
may
remove
the
case
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court.
could
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
now
removal
of
statute
in
case
where
a
federal
official
make
out
a
case
of
unfairness
in
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
trial
is
for
--
if
the
crime
is
a
state
crime.
is
that
at
all
a
subject
of
difficulty
one
should
begin
to
fuss
around
about
what
action
by
congress
duly
taken
according
to
the
legislative
process
has
future
consequences.
what
you
want
is
the
responsibility
of
congress
that
no
mandamus
can
make
them
responsible
beyond
what
the
capacities
of
men
can
do.
