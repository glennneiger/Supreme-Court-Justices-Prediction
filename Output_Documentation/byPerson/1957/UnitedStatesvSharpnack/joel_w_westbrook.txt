mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
texas
has
a
statute,
penal
code
article
492
which
provides
for
confinement
of
the
penitentiary
of
two
to
five
years
for
acts
of
miscegenation.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
believe
that
the
--
that
this
statute
is
a
very
good
starting
point
for
discussion
of
what
we
consider
to
be
the
real
central
issue
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
constitutional
responsibility
in
the
enactment
of
the
federal
criminal
law
on
the
part
of
the
congress
and
on
the
part
of
the
president.
now,
in
appellant's
brief,
we
have
been
told
that
throughout
the
entire
history
of
all
of
the
assimilative
crimes
acts
that
congress
has
not
scrutinized
the
state
laws
which
it
has
adopted
in
the
federal
criminal
law.
appellant
in
his
brief
tells
us
that
congress
has
not
excluded
from
the
scope
of
any
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
any
state
criminal
laws,
the
good,
the
bad,
the
indifferent,
or
the
probably
unconstitutional.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
it
would
definitely
be
an
inconvenience,
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
it
would
be
inconvenient,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir,
very
definitely.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
this
--
this
court
in
franklin
versus
pierce
held
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
limited
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
is
constitutional.
but
this
court
remarked
and
we
think
most
significantly
in
the
franklin
case,
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
unconstitutional
delegation,
that
there
was
no
attempt
to
apply
the
laws
to
the
future.
that's
dictum
but
we
think
it's
a
significant
statement.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir.
the
assimilative
crimes
act
prior
to
1948,
were
adoption
by
reference
of
the
state
laws
this
court
called
that
in
the
puerto
rico
versus
shell
company
case
cited
in
the
brief.
it
was
an
adoption
of
the
state
laws
then
in
existence.
now,
appellant
has
told
us
that
this
policy
of
conformity
is
a
desirable
policy
even
when
congress
doesn't
scrutinize
the
laws
it
adopts
and
that
it's
convenient
that
this
policy
of
conformity
extend
to
an
undiscriminating
acceptance
in
advance
into
federal
criminal
law
of
any
state
criminal
law
that's
enacted
after
the
1948
act.
now,
we
believe
that
prospective
assimilation
of
state
criminal
laws
is
unconstitutional
whether
it's
desirable
or
convenient
or
not.
however,
we
believe
that
it's
at
least
arguable
whether
the
policy
is
desirable
and
convenient.
and
we
believe
that
this
texas,
article
492,
this
statute
that
punishes
miscegenation,
illustrates
the
mixture
of
adopting
state
criminal
laws
without
scrutiny
and
we
believe
that
prospective
assimilation
is
inherently
mischievous
and
inherently
irresponsible.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
appellant
have
said
that
congress
had
not
sir
and
appellant
has
said
and
we
accept
it
that
there
had
been
no
state
criminal
laws
excluded
from
its
operation.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
think
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice,
i
said
mischievous
only
as
a
matter
of
practice
in
the
--
not
in
the
constitutional
sense.
in
its
prospective
assimilation
i
think
it
is
inherently
and
constitutionally
mischievous.
now,
this
--
this
article
492
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
examined
the
texas
criminal
laws
in
that
respect
because
i
anticipate
it
and
that
is
a
valid
question.
in
the
language
of
the
indictment,
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
assume
that
the
--
that
the
indictment
speaks
the
facts,
i
do
not
know
any
texas
law
which
is
covered.
you'd
noticed
that
one
of
these
counts,
if
it
had
alleged
the
act
itself,
possibly
it
would
be
covered
by
--
by
another
texas
act
enacted
prior
to
1948.
but
it
alleges
the
crime
of
enticing
the
--
the
prosecuting
witness
into
the
room
for
the
purpose
of
proposing
the
act
which
was
not
prior
to
that
time
covered
by
any
texas
statute.
i
believe
they're
not
in
the
texas
statute
which
we
cover
the
challenge
in
the
indictment.
and
according
again
to
what
mr.
justice
harlan
has
said,
we
believe
that
if
congress
had
scrutinized
as
criminal
acts
of
the
states
when
they
adopted
state
laws,
that
they
would
have
excluded
such
acts
as
texas
article
492
on
--
on
miscegenation
because
on
the
face
of
it,
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
western
district
of
texas
had
a
duty
to
prosecute
right
now,
today
in
a
federal
court,
a
negro
airman
and
his
wife
living
together
on
randolph
air
force
base
in
texas.
now,
if
a
grand
jury
were
to
indict
--
a
federal
grand
jury
were
to
indict,
the
united
states
attorney
might
move
to
dismiss
and
the
judge
might
grant
the
motion.
if
he
was
tried
and
convicted,
it
might
very
well
be
that
the
indictment
itself,
the
conviction
will
be
held
void
and
unconstitutional.
but
the
point
is
that
the
congress
in
the
first
instance
has
the
duty
to
ensure
the
citizens
are
not
punished
federally
in
the
first
place
by
laws
which
congress
itself
were
independently
considered
foolish
and
unwise
and
it
has
the
duty
to
ensure
that
citizens
are
not
subjected
to
the
harassment
and
expense
of
defending
themselves
to
prosecution
under
laws
which
congress
independently
would
consider
to
be
unconstitutional.
now,
the
president
had
a
role
in
this
legislative
process
also.
and
we
think
that
this
prospective
assimilation
of
state
criminal
law
seriously
depreciates
the
role
of
the
president
in
the
legislative
process.
here's
what
we
mean
by
that.
if
we
have
assimilative
crimes
act
limited
to
a
date
not
later
than
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
then
the
president,
if
he
feels
that
certain
state
criminal
law
should
not
be
adopted
into
federal
law,
can
by
use
of
his
veto
power
or
the
breadth
of
it,
force
individual
state
laws
foolish
ones
or
ones
he
considers
unconstitutional
to
be
excluded
from
the
scope
of
the
act.
and
in
so
doing,
his
pleasure
in
that
respect
would
prevail
unless
overwritten
by
two-thirds
vote
of
each
house
of
congress.
but
if
prospective
assimilation
of
state
law
were
permitted
and
a
state
law
is
subsequently
enacted
which
is
considered
foolish
or
mischievous
or
perhaps
unconstitutional
and
the
president
considers
that
that
should
not
be
federal
criminal
law
then
in
order
for
his
disapproval
to
take
effect,
he
must
have
the
concurrence
of
majority
of
both
arguable
crimes
rather
than
the
support
only
of
one-third
plus
aggravated
case
in
expressing
a
disapproval
of
an
assimilative
crimes
act
limited
to
the
date
of
enactment.
we
--
we
feel
that
if
a
citizen
is
indicted
by
federal
grand
jury
for
something
he
does
or
--
or
fails
to
do
on
a
federal
enclave,
he's
prosecuted
by
--
by
a
federal
prosecutor
and
convicted
by
a
federal
petty
jury
and
sentenced
by
a
federal
judge
and
confined
in
a
federal
penitentiary
then
these
results
ought
--
ought
to
flow
from
the
specific
imperative
of
--
of
a
federal
criminal
law
enacted
by
the
federal
congress
and
approved
by
the
president.
now,
there's
only
been
one
case
in
132-year
history
of
the
federal
assimilative
crimes
act
in
which
a
federal
court
has
had
occasioned
to
consider
whether
or
not
a
citizen
could
be
punished
in
federal
court
for
committing
an
act
on
a
federal
enclave
punishable
by
state
law
enacted
subsequent
to
the
assimilative
crimes
act
and
that
is
the
case
cited
by
counsel
for
the
government,
united
states
versus
paul.
there,
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
prosecute
for
acts
committed
on
the
federal
enclave
of
west
point.
under
the
1825
assimilative
crimes
act,
an
attempt
to
assimilate
for
purposes
of
this
prosecution,
an
1829
new
york
statute,
enacted
four
years
later,
john
marshal
wrote
it
is
true.
it
was
a
short
opinion.
that
short
opinion
does
not
say
that
the
1825
act
is
to
be
construed
as
limited
to
the
date
of
the
act.
it
simply
says
and
actually,
the
language
of
the
statute
as
counsel
said
is
somewhat
ambiguous
because
it
says
that
provide
--
provides
for
the
same
punishment
as
the
laws
of
the
state
provide
for
the
like
offense
when
committed
within
such
state,
susceptible
we
think
of
the
construction
perhaps
either
way,
certain
concept
of
construction
as
of
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
marshall
simply
said,
this
1825
act
is
to
be
limited
to
state
laws
enforced
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
1825
act.
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
said,
the
congress
had
apparently
interpreted
the
paul
decision
as
being
a
constitutional
restriction,
a
constitutional
limitation.
and
of
necessity,
all
the
cases
bearing
on
are
mentioning
the
assimilative
crimes
act
since
then,
have
been
dictum
--
dicta
because
congress
has
specifically
since
then
limited
the
--
the
force
of
the
act
to
the
state
laws
enforced
at
the
time
of
the
act
or
at
a
date
prior
to
that.
so,
everything
has
been
written
about
it
since
then
has
been
dicta.
there
have
been
several
expressions
by
the
lower
federal
courts
in
--
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
they
have
assumed
that
the
paul
case
was
a
constitutional
limitation.
and
then
what
we
feel
to
be
as
the
construction
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
franklin
case.
now
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
we
believe
that
the
assimilative
crimes
acts
which
were
enacted
prior
to
1948
which
limited
the
adoption
of
a
state
law
to
the
state
laws
enforced
as
of
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
is
an
alternative
and
it
is
a
constitutional
alternative
and
this
court
has
so
held
that
that
is
constitutional.
the
only
feature
of
the
1948
act
was,
we
believe,
is
constitutionally
cannot
be
done
is
to
--
it's
a
prospective
assimilation.
we
believe
that
--
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
congress
may
adopt
by
reference
all
the
state
criminal
laws
for
federal
enclaves
in
existence
at
the
time
of
passage
of
an
act.
that
is
the
alternative
and
it
does
mean
that
perhaps
if
they
do
wish
to
follow
the
policy
of
conformity
without
scrutiny
or
with
scrutiny
that
every
few
years
that
they
would
have
to
reenact
it
if
they
wanted
to
bring
all
the
--
all
of
the
state
laws
then
up
to
date.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
justice,
in
the
first
place,
you
said
specific
that
is
expressed
or
implied.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
do
not
know
of
any
expressed
limitation.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir.
the
constitution
provides
for
a
means
by
which
the
congress
shall
enact
laws.
the
process
of
passage
of
the
--
through
congress
and
provides
for
the
president's
participation
in
the
legislative
process
by
vetoing
or
approving
bills.
now
then,
our
--
what
we
draw
from
that
is
that
that
is
the
way
and
the
only
way
that
a
criminal
law
may
become
a
federal
imperative
that
when
something
has
not
previously
been
a
crime
at
randolph
air
force
base
and
becomes
a
crime
only
because
the
state
of
texas
expresses
its
will
through
its
legislature
that
then
the
constitutionally
envisioned
process
of
how
our
laws
become
law,
has
just
has
not
been
required.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
it
is
our
view
mr.
justice
that
--
to
permit
this
adoption
of
something
which
isn't
in
existence,
adoption
in
futuro.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir.
and
in
our
view,
there
is
a
difference,
mr.
justice
between
defining
a
crime
and
fixing
a
punishment
therefore
and
defining
in
part
a
crime
and
leaving
the
conditions
upon
which
it
operates
incomplete.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
difference
between
defining
a
substantive
right
and
then
saying
that
the
conditions
upon
which
these
rights
will
operate
is
the
finding
of
facts
--
certain
facts
by
administrative
agency
or
the
existence
of
certain
state
laws.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
well,
i
believe
that
when
it
was
remarked
by
mr.
justice
that
as
a
matter
of
the
will
of
congress,
i
think
that
there
is
probably
where
the
philosophical
difference
comes.
if
--
if
you
consider
that
when
congress
has
said
we
will
permit
whatever
the
states
enact
to
become
federal
criminal
law
on
federal
enclaves.
if
that
is
the
will
of
congress
acting,
if
it's
--
if
that
is
what
is
considered
to
be
then
our
position
is
not
well
taken.
if
that
isn't
the
kind
of
act
or
will
that
this
court
was
speaking
about
in
the
clark
distilling
company
case.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
in
our
view
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
in
our
view,
mr.
justice,
it
is
not
an
expression
of
the
will
of
congress
in
a
sense
to
which
this
court
is
speaking
in
the
clark
distilling
company
case.
in
the
clark
distilling
company
case
which
was
not
a
criminal
case
by
the
way
because
the
webb-kenyon
act
did
not
have
--
when
this
court
decided
the
clark
distilling
case,
january
1917,
did
not
have
any
criminal
sanctions.
it
simply
said
that
--
that
this
transportation
in
violation
of
the
state
laws
is
prohibited.
and
it
wasn't
until
a
couple
months
later,
i
believe,
in
a
post
office
corporation
bill
that
it
was
made
a
criminal
violation
to
transport
liquor
in
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that
in
the
one
case,
it
would
be
--
that
is
to
say
when
you
prospectively
assimilate
state
laws
that
what
you're
doing
is
having
the
federal
courts
enforce
state
laws
whereas
in
a
case
of
laws
adopted
as
of
the
date
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
you
are
enforcing
federal
criminal
law.
the
--
the
--
it
has
been
expressed
by
this
--
by
two
circuits
i
believe.
it
was
expressed
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
maccoy
versus
hester
which
--
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
there
was
involved
--
there
again,
a
texas
--
it
was
a
texas
libel
law
which
was
being
applied
on
a
federal
reservation.
and
the
--
the
defendant
there
contended
that
the
construction
of
that
law
should
be
or
under
the
control
by
the
decision
to
the
state
of
texas
and
the
eighth
circuit
rejected
that
contention
and
said
"no,
that's
not
so
because
we're
not
enforcing,
in
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
we're
not
enforcing
state
criminal
law,
we're
enforcing
federal
criminal
law,"
which
we
think
was
true
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
enacted
up
to
1948.
but
when
you
start
enforcing
in
federal
courts
laws
that
come
into
existence,
punishment
that
comes
into
existence
only
after
the
date
of
the
act
then
it
seems
to
us
that
you're
enforcing
a
state
criminal
laws.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
assuming
if
the
practice
on
the
part
of
congress
has
not
scrutinizing
it
is
not
only
constitutional
but
wise.
now,
we
agree
that
it's
constitutional
that
they
can
adopt
state
laws,
enforce
the
time
of
the
act
constitutionally
without
scrutinizing
whether
it's
wise
or
not.
but
we
believe
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
a
very
substantial
difference
and
the
difference
--
and
at
least
they,
congress,
has
taken
the
responsibility
for
saying
that
we
know
all
the
state
laws
are
here
but
we're
not
going
to
look
at
them,
we're
not
going
to
differentiate
between
the
good
and
the
bad
and
the
indifference
and
so
we're
taking
the
responsibility
for
it.
whereas,
in
the
case
of
prospective
assimilation,
the
irresponsibility
is
far
more
widespread
because
they
have
--
they
have
said
that
whatever
is
enacted,
we
--
we're
going
to
accept
and
we
believe
that
the
irresponsibility
there
is
inherent.
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
matter
of
practice.
it
--
it's
just
inherent
in
the
type
of
legislation.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
could
adopt
the
policy
all
the
way
from
doing
what
had
been
suggested,
adopting
a
complete
criminal
code
which
would
not
be
a
policy
of
conformity.
or
congress
could
do
what
it
has
been
doing
up
to
now
just
adopting
all
state
laws
without
scrutiny.
or
congress
could
do
something
in
between,
that
is
adopt
all
state
laws
except
that
they
might
feel
that
certain
ones
were
particularly
mischievous
or
unconstitutional
perhaps
and
that
they
should
not
subject
hundreds
of
thousands
of
military
personnel
to
work
on
this
base
and
that
base
without
their
choice,
sir,
not
to
--
in
--
in
texas,
sir,
many
have
been
(inaudible)
by
--
by
choice
being
subjected
to
--
to
federal
power.
that
they're
being
penalized
and
punished
by
the
federal
government
and
we
believe
that
congress
ought
to
take
the
responsibility
for
determining
that
--
that
the
federal
power
is
being
used
to
do
this.
now,
counsel
said
that
this
is
only
petty
crimes
that
are
--
that
are
involved
here.
there
--
there
are
some
--
quite
a
number
of
serious
crimes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
they're
serious
or
not,
it
depends
upon
whether
the
state
enacts
a
crime
to
which
it
affix
it
was
a
heavy
penalty.
in
addition
in
the
area
not
troubled
at
all
by
the
federal
criminal
court
are
--
where
they
might
have
minor
penalties
or
what
--
the
myriad
of
welfare
statutes
involving
health
and
regulations
of
water
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
which
is
true,
might
get
up
to
this
court
if
they
interfere
too
--
too
much
with
the
people's
living
on
federal
reservations
that
might
get
up
to
this
court
or
subordinate
court
to
be
held
unconstitutional
is
conflict
in
the
federal
policy.
we
believe
that
congress
has
the
responsibility
before
it
imposes
on
individuals,
on
prosecutors,
and
on
courts,
the
--
the
shifting
out
of
what's
in
conflict
of
federal
policy
or
it
is
probably
unconstitutional.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
if
i
may
be
pardoned
to
using
this
kind
of
language,
i
--
i
think
that
would
be
the
candid
way
of
going
about
it
if
they
wanted
to
do
it.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
justice,
in
the
clark
distilling
company
case,
in
a
certain
sense
it
might
be
said
that
that
is
what
congress
was
doing.
so
the
act
was
entitled
and
--
and
this
court
said
that
they
were
divesting
liquor
of
its
interstate
carriers.
however,
in
that
act,
congress
had
picked
up
the
subject
matter
and
they
said,
this
--
this
subject
matter,
this
thing,
liquor,
cannot
be
transported,
didn't
impose
any
criminal
sanction
for
it
because
it
can't
be
transported
if
it's
in
violation
of
state
laws.
at
least
congress
had
specifically
acted
there.
they
didn't
say
whatever
state
law
is
passed
or
whatever
law
the
states
passed
about
liquor
or
criminal
laws,
we're
going
to
enforce
it
criminally
in
a
court.
this
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
you
can't
have
a
crime,
and
we
believe
that
crime
is
different
from
--
from
civil
law,
that
you
can't
have
a
crime
unless
the
legislature
has
defined
it
and
the
legislature
has
fixed
the
punishment.
now,
if
you're
going
to
punish
people
federally
by
the
--
federal
processes,
federal
grand
juries,
federal
prosecutors,
federal
petty
juries,
federal
judges,
federal
penitentiaries,
then
we
believe
that
the
definition
of
the
crime
and
the
--
the
fixing
of
the
punishment
whether
it's
six
months
or
five
years
should
be
the
responsibility
even
though
it
may
not
actually
undertake
to
spell
it
out.
you
may
do
it
by
reference
but
it
should
be
the
responsibility
with
the
opportunity
to
scrutinize
of
the
federal
congress.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
justice,
i
have
the
doubt
about
it
that
--
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
removed
unless
it
could
be
originally
maintained
in
the
federal
court
and
you
would
have
presumably
the
state
being
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
thank
you.
