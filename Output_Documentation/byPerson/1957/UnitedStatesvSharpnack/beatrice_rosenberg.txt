ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
by
the
government
which
brings
up
a
problem
under
the
so-called
assimilative
crimes
act
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment
to
set
the
question
in
its
setting.
the
united
states
federal
government
in
almost
all
of
the
states,
owned
areas
of
land
greater
or
less
than,
and
over
much
of
this
area,
it
has
what
is
known
as
exclusive
jurisdiction.
the
full
power
of
legislation
is
in
the
united
states.
as
a
result,
an
act
is
a
crime
if
committed
in
those
areas
only
if
congress
says
it
is
a
crime.
now,
congress
has
designed
for
these
areas
of
exclusive
jurisdiction,
some
of
the
major
crimes
such
as
murder,
arson,
and
rape.
but
beyond
that,
it
has
said,
and
this
is
a
statute
here
involved
section
13
of
title
18,
that
a
person
guilty
of
any
act
or
omission
which
although
not
made
punishable
by
congress,
would
be
punishable
if
committed
or
omitted
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
in
which
the
federal
enclave
is
situated.
by
the
laws
thereof
enforced
at
the
time
of
such
act
or
omission,
shall
be
guilty
of
a
like
offense
and
subject
to
like
punishment,
now,
with
the
phrase,
"by
the
laws
thereof
at
the
time
of
such
act
or
omission,"
which
gives
rise
to
the
problem
here.
appellee
was
indicted
under
a
texas
statute
regarding
--
impairing
the
(inaudible)
--
morals
of
the
minor,
which
was
passed
in
1950,
two
years
after
the
enactment
of
section
13
of
title
18
in
the
1948
revision
of
the
code.
and
the
district
court
held
that
section
13,
insofar
as
it
is
docked,
state
laws
passed
after
1948,
after
the
federal
statute,
is
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
the
powers
of
congress
and
that's
the
constitutional
question
which
the
government
has
brought
here
on
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
now,
let
me
just
briefly
state
the
core
of
the
government's
position
before
i
go
into
the
history
of
the
statute
because
if
the
history
in
a
sense
which
gives
i
think
rise
to
the
decision
below
and
which
we
think
answers
the
decision
below
as
well.
but
basically,
our
position
is
this,
that
this
isn't
in
essence
a
problem
of
delegation.
what
this
statute
is,
is
the
implementation
of
the
federal
policy.
this
statute
represents
a
judgment
by
congress
that
for
federal
enclave
it
is
good
federal
policy
to
have
mind
--
on
the
whole
mind
of
crimes,
those
crimes
which
congress
has
not
thought
important
enough
to
define,
conform
to
the
laws
of
the
surrounding
areas
which
govern
them.
and
if
that's
the
basis
of
the
statute
that
this
federal
policy
which
is
the
basis
of
the
statute
is
more
effectively
implemented
by
this
kind
of
a
statute
which
adopt
the
state
laws
at
the
time
of
the
offense
then
it
is
by
a
statute
which
may
be
two
years
old
or
five
years
old
and
so
on.
if
conformity
is
the
federal
policy,
this
is
a
statute
which
carries
out
that
conformity.
as
i
said,
that's
the
heart
of
our
position
and
we
think
the
history
of
the
statute
bears
it
out.
this
is
an
old
statute.
it
was
enacted
--
first
enacted
in
1825
to
meet
the
problem
of
what
should
be
crime
on
areas
of
exclusive
jurisdiction.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it
wasn't
in
this
form
but
it
was
not
as
originally
acted
very
different,
your
honor.
in
the
1825
version,
it's
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
and
it
provided
that
a
person
committing
an
act
which
will
--
would
be
liable
to
and
receive
the
same
punishment
as
the
laws
of
the
state
provide
for
a
like
offense.
this
is
a
--
the
1825
act,
for
a
like
offense
when
committed
within
the
body
of
the
state.
now,
that
wasn't
clear
one
way
or
another
and
that's
the
question
that
came
up
for
decision
before
this
court,
in
united
states
against
paul
in
1832.
there,
on
a
certificate
of
division,
from
the
circuit
court
of
new
york,
this
court,
without
argument,
a
very
brief
opinion
by
chief
justice
marshall,
which
is
set
out
--
footnote
on
page
11,
the
whole
opinion
is
set
out
there.
this
court
ruled
that
the
act
of
1825
was
to
be
construed
as
limited
to
the
adoption
of
state
laws
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
enactment.
i
donâ€™t
think
the
word
is
compelled
that
this
was
a
construction
given
by
this
court
and
where
that
decision
was
not
couched
in
constitutional
term.
it
was
probably
meant
to
be
and
it
was
certainly
interpreted
by
congress,
i
think,
to
be
a
constitutional
decision
to
the
effect
that
this
construction
was
required.
and
so,
thereafter,
congress
has
statutes
to
catch
up.
it
did
that
in
1866.
it
did
it
again
in
1898.
and
at
that
point,
it
recognized
--
in
those
two
reenactments
it
recognized
the
limitations
of
the
paul
decision.
it
provided
that
what
should
be
a
crime
on
a
federal
enclave
was
that
which
was
a
crime
by
the
laws
of
the
surrounding
state
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1866
and
in
1880
--
1898
and
1899,
it
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
even
the
repeal
of
the
state
law
would
not
affect
the
federal
crime
as
such.
from
1933
on,
congress
showed
increasingly,
i
think,
that
--
shall
i
say
increasing
strain
against
the
paul
decision.
for
one
thing
in
1933
--
after
1933,
there
were
many
more
reenactments
of
the
statute,
much
more
frequently.
there
was
a
reenactment
in
1933
to
bring
it
up
to
state
laws
at
that
date
and
then
again
in
1935
to
bring
it
up
to
state
laws
at
that
date
and
then
in
1940.
and
finally,
in
the
1940
act
revision
of
the
criminal
code,
the
reviser
said,
we
see
no
reason
for
this
pro
forma
amendment.
we
want
to
bring
in
the
state
the
congressional
law
up
to
date
all
the
time
and
therefore
they
passed
the
act
in
its
present
form.
now,
in
the
period
from
1933
before
1948,
congress
showed
its
intention
that
its
basic
policy
was
conformity
in
several
other
way.
for
example,
as
i've
said
before,
the
oldest
statutes
had
provided
that
even
though
the
state
law
was
repealed,
it
still
remained
an
offense
for
federal
law.
congress
changed
that
in
1933
and
provided
that
it
was
a
federal
offense
at
the
time
of
enactment,
that
was
assumed
to
be
necessary
at
that
time
but
that
if
by
the
time
the
act
was
done,
the
state
law
had
been
repealed
then
it
was
not
to
be
a
federal
statute.
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
various
enactments
show
as
congress
said
in
1940,
legislation
of
this
type
is
passed
every
few
years
in
order
to
bring
the
criminal
law
in
effect
on
federal
reservations
as
nearly
as
possible
into
conformity
with
the
law
currently
in
effect
in
the
state.
1935
revision
shows
that
the
only
reason
congress
kept
inserting
dates
was
that
they
thought
they
had
to.
and
mr.
justice
black,
the
193
--
1933
amendment
which
you
sponsored,
you
said
as
senator,
that
while
there
might
be
some
questions,
you
have
some
doubt
as
to
the
policy
of
conformity.
it
seems
that
if
we
were
going
to
have
conformity
in
order
to
be
up
to
date
and
not
out
of
date.
now,
i
think
that
it
is
the
paul
decision
with
which
we
have
to
deal
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
history
of
the
statute
show
that
whatever
may
have
been
true
in
1825
or
1832
at
the
time
of
the
paul
decision,
at
the
time
when
the
federal
government
was
very
jealous
of
its
jurisdiction
that
as
of
1948
and
as
of
now,
this
isn't
realistically
--
the
statute
cannot
truly
fit
as
if
--
one
of
the
opinion
said,
as
if
the
laws
of
each
of
the
48
states
have
been
set
out
as
in
extenso.
that
isn't
the
rationale
of
the
statute.congress
has
said
so,
the
language
said
so,
the
practicality
of
the
situation
shows
that
what
congress
has
decided
really
is
that
its
desirable
federal
policy
to
have
conformity
in
this
minor
matters
to
state
law.
and
if
that's
the
federal
policy
and
i
guess
i'm
going
to
say
this
a
few
times,
if
conformity
is
an
invalid
policy
then
this
is
the
statute
which
conforms.
i
think
it
gets
those
illustrations
if
we
think
of
it
in
terms
of
an
important
area
covered
by
the
statute,
traffic
regulations.
in
1933,
we
were
enforcing
traffic
regulations
in
existence
in
1909.
and,
i
think
on
that
basis,
one
might
well
challenge
the
rationality
of
the
statute
whereas
enforced,
it
is
obviously
sensible
for
congress
to
say,
if
we
have
a
little
area
in
the
middle
of
a
state
here,
the
sensible
thing
is
to
have
traffic
regulations
the
same
as
the
whole
surrounding
state.
and
i
think
more
basic
than
that
even,
the
whole
justifications
of
the
statute
in
a
sense
has
to
be
the
policy
of
conformity.
after
all,
congress
without
some
good
reason
can't
say
that
an
act,
reckless
driving
let's
say,
is
punishable
by
six
months
imprisonment
in
this
area
and
possible
year
imprisonment
maybe
five
miles
away
in
another
state.
now,
what's
the
reason
why
this
is
possible?
this
is
possible
because
when
you
take
into
consideration
the
dual
nature
of
our
government,
the
somewhat
anomalous
position
of
federal
enclaves
in
our
dual
system
of
government,
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
state
in
this
field
of
criminal
law
and
particularly
the
so-called
common
crime,
then
it
is
rational.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
paul
and
the
subsequent
franklin
decision,
upheld
the
validity
of
the
older
form
of
a
statute,
this
court
recognize
that
it
is
rational
for
congress
to
say
under
our
system
of
government,
of
federal
enclave,
it
makes
sense
to
have
the
law
of
a
federal
enclave
conform
to
the
law
of
the
state.
and
so,
if
the
statute
--
if
the
whole
theory
of
the
assimilative
crime
act
is
valid,
it
must
be
justified
on
the
grounds
that
conformity
to
state
law
is
a
valid
federal
policy.
and
i
said
i
was
going
to
say
this
several
times,
if
conformity
is
a
valid
federal
policy
then
true
conformity
is
a
valid
policy
because
it
is
more
real
conformity
to
have
it
up
to
date
than
it
is
to
have
it
five
or
six
or
10
years
old.
i
think
that
becomes
very
clear
when
--
when
texas
cases
in
relation
to
two
decisions
by
this
court
where
it
was
held
that
this
--
that
the
federal
government
could
not
adopt
state
laws.
and
those
were
knickerbocker
ice
and
washington
against
dawson
in
253
and
274
united
states
where
on
vigorous
dissents
by
justice
holmes
and
justice
brandeis,
this
court
held
that
congress
could
not
pass
state
maritime
as
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
apply
to
maritime
industries.
but
what's
interesting
about
the
majority
opinions
in
those
cases
is
that
that
was
put
on
the
ground
that
maritime
law
has
to
be
uniform.
and
it
said
we
couldn't
have
maritime
law,
we
had
law
in
one
place
and
one
law
in
another
and
one
in
the
third.
but
this
court
has
--
the
implications
of
paul
way
back
in
1832,
and
the
implications
of
franklin
in
1909
to
16
united
states
or
that
when
it
comes
to
criminal
jurisdiction
on
federal
enclave,
it
is
valid
to
have
non-uniformity.
it
is
valid
to
look
to
the
state
law
and
therefore
it
--
it
is
valid
to
look
to
the
state
law
then
it
seems
also
valid
to
look
to
the
state
law
as
it
exist
at
the
time
that
the
act
was
done.
now,
in
addition
to
that
and
thinking
now
particularly
in
terms
of
delegation,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
history
of
the
statute
indicates
why
this
is
not
an
invalid
delegation
even
if
it
is
treated
as
such.
for
one
thing,
the
history
of
the
statute
makes
clear
that
one
has
a
right
to
consider
in
--
at
least
in
the
--
in
the
question
of
delegation
that
this
is
not
carte
blanche.
before
the
act
of
1825
and
at
all
times
then,
congress
has
designed
most
of
the
major
crimes,
most
of
the
offenses
that
have
come
up
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act
are
minor
offenses.
there
are
very
some
barely
serious
offenses
that
are
not
designed
by
congress
and
they
do
occasionally
arise.
but
the
majority
--
but
the
fact
is,
however,
the
congress
has
said,
we
are
looking
to
the
state
law
only
in
those
areas
that
we
do
not
think
important
enough
to
deform
so
that
this
is
not
a
sort
of
delegation
to
the
state
saying
we
have
no
legislative
policy.
congress
has
a
legislative
policy.
in
addition,
the
courts
have
held
by
now
and
accepted
even
though
it
is
the
lower
court's
decision
that
so
long
as
there
is
any
federal
policy
shown
in
the
field,
the
assimilative
crimes
act
will
not
apply.
for
example,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
had
a
regulation
prohibiting
segregation
in
airport.
it
was
held
that
in
view
of
that
federal
policy
expressed
by
that
federal
regulation,
the
state's
segregation
laws
did
not
apply
to
airport
in
virginia.
so
that
again,
we
have
a
limited
area
in
which
this
operates,
congress
isn't
just
generally
adopting
all
state
laws.
it
is
adopting
those
which
it
has
not
thought
in
court
and
to
design.
it
is
adopting
those
as
to
which
congress
has
in
other
fields
and
administrative
agencies
have
no
policy
so
that
this
works
in
the
quite
limited
areas.
and
thirdly,
there
is
the
limitations
that
adhere
from
the
facts
that
this
is
a
federal
system
--
that
this
is
a
federal
crime
declared
by
congress.
i
take
it
and
it
seems
to
be
more
theoretical
that
one
could
conjure
up
situations
where
conceivably
the
state
might
have
a
law
which
would
come
within
the
limitations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
the
area
that
is
led
to
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
bill.
and
i
suppose
that's
where
the
greatest
possible
question
of
delegation
of
powers
that
arise.
but
this
is
more
--
this
is
not
fair.
actually,
this
is
a
--
when
one
examines
this,
this
possibility
cannot
arise
because
these
crimes
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act
are
federal
crimes
to
be
prosecuted
by
federal
prosecutors
in
federal
court.
and
therefore,
if
one
does
conceive
as
an
area
which
might
be
valid
to
the
state
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
could
not
so
long
as
the
federal
government
has
to
act
--
would
have
to
act
within
the
limitations
of
the
fifth.
so
that
on
this
basis,
as
of
1948
or
as
of
the
present
time,
the
implications
of
the
paul
decision
are
shown
by
a
hundred
years
of
history
to
be
less
fraud
than
may
appear
at
that
time.
and
as
a
result,
it
seems
that
as
i
said
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
consider
this
really
a
delegation.
this
is
really
congress
acting
but
even
if
it
is
thought
to
be
delegation,
the
delegation
is
in
a
very
limited
area
which
circumscribed
bounds
and
considering
that
we
are
dealing
here
not
within
an
administrative
agency.
if
--
if
one
thinks
of
it
in
terms
of
delegation,
we
are
dealing
with
the
problem
that
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
we
are
a
federal
system
of
government
that
such
--
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
area
which
even
now,
is
considered
primarily
the
place
where
the
judgment
of
the
state
as
reflected
by
the
state
legislature,
this
is
the
area
which
under
our
system
of
government
is
primarily
left
for
state
legislation.
on
that
basis,
even
as
delegation,
we
think
as
of
this
time
that
delegation
would
be
appropriate.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
in
essence
it
is
not
delegation
because
its
congress
that
makes
the
policy
and
it
is
a
policy
which
has
it
--
has
its
foundation
of
fact
that
conformity
to
state
law
is
something
which
our
system
permit
and
which
is
rational
under
that
system
and
that
if
you
accept
that
as
paul
and
franklin
do,
you
accept
the
principle
that
there
should
be
conformity
and
this
is
the
actual
conformity.
this
court
has
held
several
times
and
particularly
in
relation
to
--
in
clark
distilling
and
hornbuckle
242
united
states
that
where
congress
says,
"we
will
prohibit
interstate
commerce
to
things
that
are
in
violation
of
a
policy
of
a
state."
for
example,
it
is
unlawful
under
federal
law
to
ship
liquor
into
a
dry
state.
and
this
comes
into
effect
in
the
future
whenever
a
state
decides
to
go
dry
if
it
does
or
it
--
if
the
law
ceases
to
have
effect
when
the
state
decides
not
to
be
dry.
this
court
--
this
court
held
in
clark
distilling
at
that
time
that
that
was
an
unconstitutional
delegation
because
it
was
the
will
of
congress
that
gave
this
statute
its
implications.
it
was
the
will
of
congress
that
made
the
act
criminal.
well,
that's
the
same
thing
here.
it
is
congress
--
if
the
policy
of
congress,
not
the
policy
of
the
state,
it's
the
policy
of
congress
that
said,
"we
think
it's
a
good
government
for
a
federal
enclave
to
have
these
on
the
whole
minor
laws
conform
to
the
laws
of
the
surrounding
state."
and
to
that
extent,
we
--
it
is
the
federal
will
that
makes
this
thing
a
crime
and
we
think
that
the
rational,
although
different,
is
very
much
the
same
because
it
is
the
will
of
congress
and
it
is
based
on
a
policy
which
under
our
federal
system
has
validity.
i
just
want
to
make
one
point
in
answer
to
my
opponent's
brief.
and
he
cite
the
--
and
placed
assembly
lines
on
the
penn
dairies
case
and
the
pacific
coast
dairy
case
decided
by
this
court
in
318
united
states
which
deals
with
the
field
of
regulation
licensing.
those
are
cases
which
arise
under
the
civil
law
and
the
civil
law
of
federal
enclave
is
different
from
the
criminal
because
in
the
civil
law,
congress
has
not
acted
except
in
very
limited
areas,
taxation,
workmen's
compensation.
on
the
civil
law,
congress
has
not
passed
the
equivalent
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
and
this
court
has
said
that
what
you
apply
there
is
the
rule
of
international
law
that
you
take
over
the
private
law
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
session.
but
if
the
absence
of
action
in
a
sense
that
has
made
the
problems
of
federal
enclave,
these
have
been
a
subject
to
the
two
volume
study
by
the
president's
committee
but
the
problems
are
almost
or
to
a
large
extent
i
should
say,
civil
and
many
more
cases,
a
matter
of
fact,
into
--
have
arisen
which
presents
problems
in
the
civil
field
rather
than
the
criminal.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
the
very
fact
that
congress
has
not
made
--
affected
general
policy
in
the
civil
field
whereas
in
the
criminal
law,
it
has
consistently
done
so
and
its
policy
looking
over
this
hundred
years
of
history
is
clearly
that
that
as
to
minor
offenses,
conformity
is
a
desirable
policy
and
as
we
say
this
is
the
statute
that
has
the
true,
the
contemporaneous,
the
actual
conformity.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
it
is
constitutional.
