chief
justice
earl
warren
i
notice
--
i
noticed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
westbrook
that
the
federal
statute
was
passed
in
1948
and
--
and
these
crimes
were
defined
in
1950.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
no
texas
statutes
making
these
things
offensive
before
1950?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
westbrook,
is
there
any
other
alternative
than
--
than
to
have
the
government
enact
--
the
congress
enact
a
--
a
complete
criminal
code
keeping
it
up
to
--
to
date
or
on
the
other
hand
leaving
many
serious
crimes
uncovered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
--
what
is
your
alternative
under
your
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
westbrook,
isn't
it
almost
a
distinction
without
a
difference
to
say
that
--
that
it's
an
unconstitutional
--
unconstitutional
delegation
if
congress
declares
the
policy
of
adopting
these
laws
prospectively
and
then
on
the
other
hand
that
they
may,
each
year,
by
a
validation
act
without
consideration
of
the
thousands
of
acts
that
are
passed
by
all
the
legislators
make
a
sound
policy
of
adopting
state
laws?
isn't
--
isnâ€™t
it
almost
distinct
and
without
a
difference,
the
practical
standpoint
at
least?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
if
there
is
--
if
you
require
congress
to
do
that,
to
pick
and
choose
the
laws
that
it's
going
to
ratify
each
year,
that
you
immediately
get
down
to
the
position
where
congress
has
to
have
a
full
criminal
code
for
all
--
all
of
the
state
offenses
in
--
in
every
state
of
the
union
and
--
and
i
thought
you
said
that
there
was
an
alternative
premise
other
than
that.
