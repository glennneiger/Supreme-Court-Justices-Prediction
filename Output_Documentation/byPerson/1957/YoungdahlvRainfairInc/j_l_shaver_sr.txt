mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
please.
at
the
outset,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
--
i've
gotten
seriously
whether
we
would
be
the
termed
strike
breakers.
that
puts
us
on
defensive
to
be
a
strike
breaker.
i'd
like
to
drop
that
in
because
we
were
working
at
the
plant.
these
employees
were
working
at
the
plant.
they
had
the
right
to
work
at
the
plant
and
they
wanted
to
continue
to
work
at
the
plant.
49
people
went
out
on
strike
and
when
they
went
out
on
strike,
the
rest
of
them
did
not
go
out
on
strike
but
continued
to
work.
so,
as
to
whether
we
are
strike
breakers
are
not
under
arkansas
law
or
scabs
or
whatever,
the
union
which
is
to
call
us,
we
say
that
we
are
not.
now,
the
case
to
--
to
us
seems
simple.
rainfair
incorporated
manufacture
slacks
and
they
have
been
in
a
little
town
of
wynne
where
i
was
born
and
raised
and
i
like
it.
and
there
are
107
employees,
the
people
of
wynne
are
trying
to
get
in
the
industry
and
they
donated
and
put
up
money
and
got
industry,
got
the
one
little
plant
there
to
manufacture
slacks.
well,
on
the
week
ending
before
may
2nd,
i
believe
on
monday,
may
2nd,
on
saturday
or
friday,
everybody
was
happy
and
quit
work
and
on
monday,
when
the
management
got
there,
there's
a
picket
line
around
the
plant
in
about
10
o'clock
and
11
o'clock.
the
union
warns
management
that
a
strike
was
going
on.
now,
29
of
the
employees
struck
and
they
picketed
there
for
i'd
say
two
weeks.
i
--
i
believe,
i'm
correct
on
that.
nobody
--
may
the
19th,
they
quit.
now,
doing
that
picket
line,
they
didn't
do
very
much
damage.
they
threatened
to
whip
the
manager,
mr.
bonady
said
he's
a
northerner
came
from
wisconsin
and
that
he
was
going
to
run
back
to
wisconsin
and
wipe
up
the
conflict
with
it.
around
the
plant
is
parking
places
for
cars,
there
was
nails
found
strewn
all
of
over
parking
area
one
morning.
and
those,
as
i've
said
found
strewn
on
that.
and
another
time,
there
was
a
cart
of
roof
intact.
beautiful
shining
roof
intact,
it
was
thrown
in
mr.
bonady's
driveway
and
in
the
driveway
of
the
employees.
and
they
were
no
--
i
say,
they
were
found
that
the
next
morning.
but
with
all
of
that,
there
was
--
there's
nothing
that
was
done
about
the
picket
line.
on
the
19th,
the
union
warned
that
they
were
sending
back
this
29
employees
or
they
notified
mandate.
when
the
--
i
forgot
to
tell
you
this,
when
the
29
refused
to
report
for
work
monday
morning,
management
wrote
them
a
letter
and
asked
them
to
come
back
and
said,
“if
you
don't
come
back,
we
presume
that
you
do
not
want
to
be
an
employee”
and
i
think
three
came
back.
now,
when
these
other
employees
came
back
to
work,
the
management
didn't
take
them,
they
employed
13
additional
people.
and
then
it
brought
their
own
until
about
june
20th
and
they
had
the
meeting
down
at
forrest
city,
arkansas
and
what
happened
at
that
time
was
simply
this.
they
voted
to
go
on
a
strike
and
i
believe
it
was
started,
i
think,
i
say
the
picket
line
was
started
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
now,
if
you
would
listen
here
to
mr.
isaacson,
you
would
think
that
with
this
woman
that
was
pregnant
and
the
snake
in
this
garden
--
you'd
think
that
we're
in
the
garden
of
eden
when
he
talks
about
what
happened
but
the
picket
line
started
at
12:30
at
night
because
two
of
the
strikers
who
didn't
did
like
mrs.
newby
who
was
a
worker,
drove
up
in
front
of
her
house
and
mrs.
newby
lived
in
a
trailer.
and
mrs.
newby
wasn't
asleep.
she
had
a
daughter
stay
in
there.
so
these
two
strikers
had
been
going
back
and
forth
on
rowena
street
which
runs
north
and
south
in
a
little
town
and
the
plants
on
the
west
side
and
mrs.
newby's
trailer
is
on
the
east
side
of
rowena
and
just
north
to
the
plant.
that
was
her
home
and
she
will
sleep
there
and
she
had
gone
down
and
wasn't
asleep,
she
was
leaning
down
and
all
of
a
sudden,
she
stepped
out
and
two
of
these
strikers,
i
believe
roberts
and
someone
i
don't
know,
punctured
two
of
the
tires
of
other
one.
a
punctured
toward
the
tires
of
the
automobile
that
mrs.
newby's
daughter
owned
and
was
parked
in
front
of
her
home.
she
immediately
got
up
and
called
the
law.
the
law
arrested
them.
they
went
down
and
try
them
and
was
convicted
and
fined
and
that's
undisputed
in
this
record.
well,
about
5:30
or
6
o'clock,
the
law
was
called
again
and
one
of
the
windows
of
the
plant
was
knocked
out
and
there
was
a
five
foot
black
snake
laying
closed
to
the
broken
window.
and
the
city
marshal
down
there
(inaudible)
he
goes
own
and
he
captured
the
snake.
so,
we've
got
--
we've
got
a
snake
in
the
plant
at
5:30
in
the
morning
and
we've
got
these
two
strikers
operating
at
12:30
that
night.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
all
i
know,
it
was
a
black
snake.
[laughter]
so,
when
the
picket
line
started
the
next
morning,
they
rendered
a
lot
right
across
from
rowena
street
on
the
east
side
of
the
streets
18
feet
wide,
the
grass
was
18
feet
on
it.
and
right
over
here
was
the
lot,
they
put
a
tent
and
three
benches
and
some
chairs,
and
that
was
the
focal
point
for
the
--
what
the
union
folks
called
“picketing
activity.”
and
that
was
a
place
that
all
the
trouble
start.
now,
they
said
that
they
just
walk
up
and
down
the
street
out
there
and
having
a
picket
and
add
something
on
it
--
some
kind
of
a
sign
on
it
but
that
didn't
work
out.
now,
what
--
what
really
happened
out
there,
when
the
picketing
was
resumed
then
usually
one
or
two
pickets
would
walk
and
carry
signs
up
and
down
rowena
street.
other
union
staff
members
strike
as
they
sympathizes
would
assemble
under
and
around
the
tent
in
groups
estimated
at
different
time
from
8
to
37.
it
was
a
focal
point
of
all
these
picketing
and
the
headquarters
for
the
concerted
action
will
be
the
name
calling,
singing
or
jeering.
as
the
employees
would
go
to
and
from
work
at
the
plant,
or
go
to
lunch,
or
take
a
recess,
this
was
a
persistent
thing.
this
was
a
combination
of
people.
the
strikers
would
contemplate
along
the
west
edge
of
their
lot
and
sometimes
in
rowena
street
engaged
in
loud
and
offensive
name
calling,
singing,
and
shouting
directly
at
the
workers.
now,
what
did
they
do?
this
group
fair
would
insult
these
workers
and
when
we
were
asked
--
when
mr.
youngdahl,
mr.
becker
and
the
other
gentleman
that
represent
the
union
was
asked
“why
did
you
insult
them?”
“oh,
was
that
insulting
them?”
”yes,
it
was
insulting
them.”
“do
you
mean
calling
them
those
names
was
an
insult?”
“yes,
that
was
an
insult.”
“do
you
think
you
could
persuade
people
by
insulting
them?”
“no,
i
don't
think
we
could.”
now,
the
question
here
with
reference
to
the
meaning
of
scab
right
there,
i
say,
that
question
is
outside
of
this
lawsuit.
now,
when
the
people
themselves
who
used
the
word
and
who
construed
it
to
be
an
insult
and
who
said
that
if
they
had
been
called
those
names,
they
would
have
been
insulted.
i
don't
see
why
we
have
to
go
to
webster
or
merriam
or
greenway,
or
any
of
these
people
that
defines
the
meaning
of
various
words.
now,
is
there
--
is
there
any
question
about
a
person
having
any
privacy
about
going
to
work?
for
instance,
if
i
am
going
down
the
streets
of
wynne,
arkansas
and
it
is
a
little
town
again
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
4500.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
it's
the
right
east
--
right
west
of
memphis.
it's
about
50
miles
west
of
memphis.
those
are
good
times.
[laughs]
and
i'd
like
to
say,
they're
good
people
down
there
and
when
he
charges
in
his
brief
here
about
our
ignorance
and
how
cool
we
are
down
there.
i'd
like
to
take
exceptions
to
that,
that
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
lawsuit
here.
any
charges
that
these
people
that
didn't
strike
were
those
kind
of
people
but
what
kind
of
people
were
those
that
did
strike?
were
they
the
same
type
that
they
accused
us
of
being
in?
in
other
words,
i
feel
more
here
like
i'm
arguing
to
a
question
of
fact
to
a
jury
in
this
--
in
this
thing,
what
is
the
question
of
facts
here?
now,
the
thing
that
always
approached
me
as
i
sit
down
there
and
meditate
and
contemplate,
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
it
is
really
a
great
honor
to
me
to
have
the
opportunity
to
address
the
court.
i
sit
down
there
and
wonder.
do
these
people
that
want
to
strike
and
these
people
that
don't
want
to
strike
--
do
these
people
that
strike,
do
they
have
the
right
to
mistreat
and
abuse
people
that
got
the
same
constitutional
right
that
they
have
on
their
philosophy
of
life?
in
other
words,
aren't
we
weighing
and
equating
here
just
enough
in
this
little
rowena
street
strike,
the
question
of
the
right
to
work,
the
police
filed
a
state,
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state,
the
right
to
strike.
if
--
do
this
make
sense?
if
i'm
walking
down
the
street
with
my
wife
and
she
was
pregnant,
and
from
8
to
25
people,
four
times
a
day
for
four
days,
or
twice
a
day,
would
stop
her
and
say
--
well,
the
first
time
that
they
will
picket
--
if
they
didn't
have
anything
to
say
to
me,
i
mean
you
know
they
didn't
say
anything
but
the
last
time
when
they
hollered,
“go
get
the
hot
water
ready.
and
i'm
coming
to
make
another
payment
on
the
baby,
call
doctor
beat”
and
here
last
week,
i
went
to
the
doctor
and
one
day
they
said,
“well,
you
can
work
another
hour
until
you
go
into
the
delivery
room.”
they
said,
“there's
no
need
in
going
up
there
right
now.”
and
when
i
came
back,
they
asked
me,
“did
i
go
on
a
false
alarm.”
yes,
conditions
like
that.
there's
the
law.
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
deal
to
anybody
that
wants
to
strike,
a
constitutional
right
to
insult
a
woman
because
she
has
to
work
and
carrying
a
baby?
now,
let's
see
what
they
said
about
it.this
is
their
construction.
on
page
58
of
the
brief,
when
taken
place
between
women,
either
who
have
grown
up
together
in
a
rural
community,
who
have
attended
the
same
school,
and
who
now
attend
the
same
church,
they
appear
to
be
little
more
than
good
natured
man.
in
this
category
or
the
jocular
remarks
addressed
to
one
of
the
women
who
was
pregnant,
and
another
whose
dress
was
cut
somewhat
revealingly.
they
not
only
called
those
workers
persistently,
call
them
“fools”.
is
any
--
does
that
convey
any
idea?
is
there
something
society
gets
out
to
call
a
man
a
fool?
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
think
it's
an
insult.
they
call
them
“yellow
scabs”,
“cotton
patch
scabs.”
now,
who
did
all
these?
mr.
youngdahl,
mr.
becker,
and
i
can't
recall
the
other
man
and
the
two
other
staff
members
who
were
ruth
kimsey
(ph)
and
(inaudible)
that
was
the
staff
there.
they
did
this
thing
persistently
and
continuing.
there
is
one
--
one
instance
--
let's
take
this.
perhaps
it
shows
what
they
did
here.
two
of
those
young
ladies
left
in
the
car
and
went
downtown
to
get
some
gasoline
and
two
of
the
strikers
drove
up
and
said,
“don't
wait
on
them.”
the
filling
station
man
says,
“who
got
here
first?”
and
he
said,
“don't
wait
on
them
because
they
are
scabs.”
now
that
happened.
now,
what
did
they
do
to
the
manager?
well,
the
manager
would
leave
and
go
to
town
or
go
to
different
places
and
they
followed
him
in
the
car.
they
just
--
the
strikers
would
follow
him
and
they'd
go
where
he
went
and
just
followed
him
and
escorted
him.
they
say,
“that's
not
intimidation”.
“i
guess
the
man
has
got
a
right
to
drive
his
car
downtown
without
being
followed”.
i
don't
know
whether
he
has
not.
now,
what
did
they
do
to
his
home
at
night,
the
phone
would
ring,
they
add
on
party
lines
out
there,
like
61f
and
so
forth
and
then
you
--
everybody
rings
on
the
party
line
and
he
answers
and
he
can't
find
out
who's
calling.
so,
it
continues
to
ring
until
12
o'clock
at
night
and
finally
he
has
to
have
it
shut
off
and
that
--
and
that's
what
happened
in
that
case.
so
these
things
continued
on
to
four
days
until
we
got
the
injunction.
now,
something
has
been
said
about
this
one
snake
in
the
plant.
during
the
trial
of
the
lawsuit,
there
was
a
lot
of
glass
found,
strewn
all
over
the
parking
lot
and
during
that
trial
they
didn't
--
the
court
didn't
like
it.
they
had
issued
the
temporary
injunction
and
on
its
motion,
the
court
turned
the
glass
over
to
the
sheriff
and
asked
the
sheriff
to
find
out
who
did
it
or
the
city
marshal.
and
they
found
out
that
two
boys
did
it
and
he
cited
the
boys
and
their
parents
to
show
cause,
why
they
shouldn't
be
adjudged
and
contempt
to
court.
during
that
hearing,
the
--
one
of
the
called
boys
said,
the
reason
he
did
it,
he
just
didn't
like
mrs.
newby.
she
was
a
worker
and
she
was
--
she
was
--
they
didn't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
mrs.
newby.
the
other
boy
said
he
didn't
know
why
he
did
it
but
there's
a
good
friend
of
mine,
we
know
everybody
down
there
in
my
town.
i
know
all
these
person
and
i
know
lee
hamrick
was
one
of
the
boy's
father
and
lee
had
been
a
striker
in
the
first
strike
and
had
a
home
right
there
where
ms.
newby's
home
was.
so,
lee
got
up
to
testify
because
he
--
he
was
cited
for
contempt
and
just
before
he
got
out
off
the
stand,
i
asked
him
this
questions
and
i'm
reading
from
189
of
the
record.
question.
“i
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
is
this
true
or
not?
did
you
tell
me
out
there
when
we
were
talking
at
the
reason
you
got
out
the
union
was
because
they
had
tried
to
get
you
to
do
violence
and
destroy
property?”
“i
said
some
of
them
had
tried,
mr.
shaver
and
i
wouldn't
do
it.”
”wait
a
minute.
what
did
you
say?”
answer.
“you
couldn't
hear
me?”
“no,
sir.”
“i
said
they
did
try
to
get
me
to
and
i
wouldn't
do
it.”
“who
tried?”
“i
didn't
say
who.”
“i
know
you
didn't
say
it
but
would
you
tell
me
now?”
“no,
sir.
i
won't
tell
you
now.”
“wouldn't
you
tell
me
whether
--
some
of
the
people
who
were
on
the
picket
line?”
i
won't
tell
you
that.”
“you
won't
do
that?
was
it
mr.
youngdahl?”
i
won't
say
that.”
“you
won't
say
that?”
“you
can
call
them
all
and
ask
them."
the
court.
mr.
hamrick
started
out
off
the
stand
and
the
court
intervened
at
that
time
because
he
told,
he
won't
answer
the
question.
and
the
court
said,
“i
think
you
can
answer
the
question,
mr.
hamrick.
you
would
have
this
sit
up
here.”
“did
mr.
youngdahl
try
to
get
through
to
destroy
the
property?”
“now,
answer
the
question.”
“all
right.”
“now,
i
want
to
ask
you
to
give
the
names
of
the
people
who
were
on
the
picket
line
that
is,
that
were
involved
in
the
strike.”
“it
wasn't
any
of
them.”
“wait
a
minute.
name
the
people
involved
in
the
strike
that
tried
to
get
you
to
destroy
or
damage
property.”
“now,
i
want
you
to
give
the
names
of
the
people
here,
who
asked
you
to
damage
or
destroy
a
property,
the
rainfair
people
or
the
workers
of
the
rainfair
corporation?”
“didn't
anyone
asked
me
to
destroy
the
property.”
“what
did
they
asked
you
to
do?”
“they
asked
me
to
put
snakes
and
stuff
like
that
in
there.
they
asked
me
too
but
i
wouldn't
do
it.
now,
i
didn't
know
what
he
was
going
to
say.
he
had
told
me
--
i
thought
he
had
told
me
to
try
to
get
in
to
destroy
a
property.”
and
then
i
say,
“wait
a
minute.
they
wanted
you
to
put
snake?”
“yes.”
“in
the
plant?
you
knew
a
snake
was
found
in
that
plant.
didn't
you?
“did
you
put
the
snake
in
there?”
“no.
i
didn't.”
“who
was
it,
wanted
you
to
put
the
snake
in
there?”
and
i
allowed
him,
this
is
what
you
call
dodge
in
the
law
you
know
when
he's
asking.
well,
he
lives
in
augusta
now,
that's
another
town
over
there
and
i
didn't
pursue
it
any
further
because
that's
about
what
he
said,
happened
in
that
case.
but
anyway,
we
do
have
here
the
findings
of
the
court.
we
have
the
--
of
the
lower
court,
we
have
the
--
the
recruiting
of
people
to
throw
snakes
in
the
plant.
we
have
a
snake
in
the
plant
and
we
have
two
girls
sitting
in
the
lawn
one
afternoon
when
two
of
the
strikers
went
by
and
said,
“you
better
shake
your
sheets
tonight.
you
might
find
some
snakes
in
your
sheet.”
now,
i
don't
know
whether
that's
enough
testimony
or
not.
it
was
enough
testimony
for
the
lower
court
and
it
was
enough
testimony
for
the
supreme
court
on
--
on
that
one
basis.
but
in
order
to
sum
up
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
it
would
seem
that
the
tacks,
the
nails,
the
snake,
the
testimony
of
hamrick,
the
congregating,
the
blocking
of
the
workers
coming
in
and
going
to
the
plant
and
coming
in
to
the
highway
and
backing
the
cars
out,
what
i
call
mass
picketing,
they
call
it
concerted
activity.
i
call
it
as
much
picketing
as
to
come
out
in
a
group
and
have
a
plan
to
stop
people
from
going
to
work,
as
much
picketing
as
it
is
can
assign
in
walking
down
the
road.
so,
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
i
take
it
that
it's
still
the
law
that
the
court
will
forward
the
facts
here
that
is
defining
of
the
state
court
would
be
supported
and
these
cases.
there's
no
--
you
gentlemen
--
these
cases
cited
in
this
brief
here.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
it
starts
from
thornhill
v.
alabama,
a
group
--
it
is
imperative
that
when
the
effective
exercise
of
these
rights
are
claimed
to
be
abridged,
the
court
should
weigh
the
circumstances
and
the
phrase
of
substantiality
of
the
reasons
advanced
in
support
of
the
challenge
regulation.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
or
what
we
do,
we
say
that
this
whole
thing
was
plain
a
pattern
and
we
think
after
may,
the
violence
there
was
--
was
the
tacks
and
the
nails
and
the
threats.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
in
other
words
you
mean
in
the
first
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
oh,
i
think
if
all
that's
done
is
walk
up
and
down
and
there's
been
nothing
more,
i
think
it
has
been
a
peaceful
picketing.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
it
is
--
i
think
that's
the
--
i
think
that's
the
only
question
in
this
case
in
my
humble
opinion.
in
other
words,
is
the
--
is
this
injunction
too
broad?
that's
--
that's
the
question
they
raised
there.
now,
this
--
may
i
address
myself
to
that
question?
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
well,
you
say
meadowmoor.
now
of
course
we
understand
the
meadowmoor
case
that
you've
got
to
get
killed
and
bombed
and
stench
bombs
and
--
and
all
those
things
before
we
have
any
right.
the
--
the
lawyers
talk
about
--
you
have
to
have
actual
violence
not
intimidation
or
coercion
or
it
continues
of
it
after
the
injunction
is
granted,
the
expectation
of
a
continuance
of
it.
and
that's
what
i
understood
meadowmoor
was.
now,
we
had
a
judge
down
there
in
arkansas
named
judge
frank
smith.
he's
very
much
beloved.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir,
for
30
odd
years.
and
it
became
his
--
if
you'd
pardon
me
for
quoting
this
just
a
minute
because
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
also
quoted
as
i
understand.
i
quoted
an
arkansas
case
once
before
judge
trieber,
federal
judge
in
little
rock
and
he
told
me
never
to
do
that
again.
he
was
just
joking
with
me.
i
presumed
i
was
young
and
scared
to
death
and
i
toss
my
book
up
immediately.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
he
was
a
wonderful
judge.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
but
in
this
--
this
135
arkansas
at
page
86.
it
--
it's
the
foundation
case
of
arkansas
law.
and
it
was
decided
in
1918
and
it
is
a
question
of
first
impression
in
this
state
and
a
number
of
other
states
like
this
one
have
no
cases
on
the
subject.
so,
all
this
case
holds
the
--
the
right
to
carry
on
a
lawful
business
without
obstruction
is
a
property
right.
and
one
which
the
courts
have
never
hesitated
to
protect
and
its
protection
is
the
proper
object
for
the
granting
of
an
injunction.
it's
a
well
thought
out
case.
it
quotes
here
from
a
georgia
court,
in
discussing
a
similar
question,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
that
the
conduct
which
operates
upon
ones
fear
rather
that
upon
his
judgment
or
his
sympathy
is
coercive,
crowd
is
naturally
collect,
disturbances
of
the
peace
always
eminent.
the
interference
with
this
business
was
direct
and
immediate
and
it
was
intended
to
be.
in
other
words,
they
intended
to
insult
these
people
and
they
intended
to
create
--
intimidate
them
and
create
fear
in
them
so
that
they
would
not
go
back
to
work
because
they
said
they
intended
to
do
it.
well,
this
case
that's
--
that's
the
case,
that's
been
the
law
in
arkansas
since
1918
but
they've
got
to
jump
on
the
judge
opinion
and
said
his
opinion
was
an
anachronism.
it
was
out
of
date.
and
that
was
riggs
v.
tucker
duck
&
rubber
company.
it's
cited
in
the
brief,
its
196
ark.
71.
and
in
this
--
in
this
case,
they
answered
our
procedure
down
there
and
i
don't
know
where
the
--
and
in
this
case
came
up
from
fort
smith
and
it's
a
question
of
an
injunction
being
all
inclusive
and
this
injunction,
it's
drawn
in
this
case,
it
was
drawn
from
the
worrying
of
this
--
the
tuckers
case
and
the
riggs-tucker
case.
in
other
words,
i
copied
the
words
from
them.
that's
where
i
got
the
injunction.
the
objection
of
that
injunction
against
all
picketing
of
appellee's
place
of
business
whether
done
peaceably
or
not
was
too
broad
and
in
access
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
grant
could
not
be
sustained
where
the
answers
to
the
complaint
asking
that
the
injunction
be
made
violent,
did
not
raise
such
an
issue
or
denied
that
the
picketing
had
been
conducted
in
an
unlawful
manner
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
an
intention
to
modify
the
methods
used.
no
legislation
has
been
enacted
in
this
state,
depriving
the
courts
of
power
to
issue
injunctions
and
labor
strikes
and
proper
cases.
while
labors
have
the
right
to
organize
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
improve
the
conditions
upon
which
they
work
to
go
on
strike
if
these
demands
are
not
met
and
to
peacefully
picket
as
a
means
of
enforcing
their
demands,
they
may
not
use
force,
violence,
coercion
or
intimidation
but
must
so
use
their
right
to
strike
and
picket
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
others.
when
picketing
is
so
unlawful
as
to
indicate
the
defendants
do
not
intend
to
use
their
right
in
a
lawful
manner.
it
may
reasonably
be
expected
that
such
unlawful
conduct
will
in
the
absence
of
an
injunction
continue
and
the
trial
court
may
in
exercise
of
their
discretion
enjoined
further
picketing
all
together.
where
picketing
conducted
by
defendant
consists
of
one
continuous
transaction
involving
unlawful
conduct
on
their
part
and
showing
by
a
systematic
course
of
conduct
and
concerted
action,
their
intention
to
accomplish
their
purpose
even
by
unlawful
means,
actually
will
do
complete
justice
by
enjoining
the
whole
of
the
unlawful
proceeding.
now,
over
here,
that
--
that
has
been
the
law
in
our
states
since
1980.
now,
the
last
--
on
page
584
of
the
opinion,
we
repeat
again
the
issue
involved
in
the
trial
of
this
court
and
the
court
rule
was
not
that
of
the
right
to
picket
peacefully.
the
chancery
on
his
opinion
quoted
from
mr.
(inaudible)
case
which
expressly
recognizes
that
right.
the
appellants
did
not
ask
a
modification
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
to
that
effect.
on
the
contrary,
they
denied
having
violated
any
law
or
any
of
the
rights
of
their
employer
and
there
was
manifested
an
intention
to
continue
the
conduct
they
had
previously
pursued.
it
was
evidently
the
view
of
the
court
below
that
the
right
of
picketing
peacefully
could
not
be
made
excuse
for
the
concerted
plan
of
intimidation,
coercion
and
violence
which
the
pickets
were
employing,
not
only
with
the
approval
but
with
the
instigation
--
instigation
of
the
leaders.
now,
that
--
that
has
been
our
law
down
there
and
it
--
the
question
is
whether
that
violates
the
--
it's
too
broad
or
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
don't
think
it
does
in
this
case
because
as
we
quote
in
our
brief,
milk
wagon
drivers
versus
meadowmoor
and
also,
132
a.l.r.
and
down
the
proper
procedure
is
for
respondents
to
file
a
motion
to
modify
the
injunction
in
the
trial
court
even
when
respondents
are
able
to
show
the
trial
court,
that
peaceful
picketing
would
be
carried
on
by
the
union,
they
are
free
to
do
so.
the
union
does
not
attempt
to
make
any
such
showing.
now,
there
are
three
cases
there
that's
what
our
court
has
said
as
to
how
to
get
your
record
straight.
that's
221
ark.
509
and
225
ark.
699.
those
are
two
of
the
late
cases
in
our
state.
and
this
(voice
overlap)
case
is
--
hadn't
been
out
here.
it's
in
the
advance
sheets.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
think
--
i
can't
answer
that.
i
know
that
this
last
case
was
not.
what
happened
there
was
that
a
person
has
been
enjoined
from
operating
his
grocery
store
on
sunday
and
he
kept
on
operating.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
gather
that
you
are
--
you
argue
that
the
meadowmoor
case
is
--
doesn't
go
quite
far
enough
but
it
provided
it
in
the
background
of
(inaudible)
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
well,
i'll
cite
the
pattern
set
at
the
early
picketing
devotes
on
--
on
may,
the
--
the
nails
and
the
tacks
and
the
threats
to
wipe
the
street
clean,
the
manager
and
the
threat
to
ms.
newby
and
move
her
out
of
her
house,
that's
all
in
that
record.
and
then
they
--
then
after
they
come
back
the
second
time
was
then
they
come
back
by
puncturing
these
tires
and
throwing
a
snake
and
that's
all
the
violence
there
is
in
the
second
picket.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
that
the
--
the
puncturing
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes.
that's
all
it's
--
that's
all
it
said
in
that
second
picket
line.
when
we
tried
--
i
tried
to
show
the
whole
pattern
of
the
conduct
during
the
whole
period
of
time
is
what
i've
tried
to
do.
now,
then
these
other
matters,
i
just
like
to
take
them
up
shortly.
i'd
like
to
raise
this
before
i
overlook
and
that's
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
any
question
of
preemption
ever
raised
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
preemption.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
when
this
case
was
tried
and
all
this
labor
record
that
mr.
isaacson
has
talked
about.
there's
nothing
like
that
in
this
record.
this
was
just
a
straight
suit
to
enjoin
intimidation,
violence
and
so
forth
by
a
state,
before
a
state
chancery
court.
that's
all
it
intends
in
this
record.
now,
all
this
other
that
they
brought
in
here,
they
brought
it
in
within
their
brief.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
it
was
raised
in
the
arkansas
state
supreme
court
the
first
time.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
trial
court.
the
answers
in
the
trial
court
set
out
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
they
set
out
further
about
the
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
that's
one
of
their
answers
in
the
lower
court,
unfair
labor
practice.
there's
no
evidence.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
except
that
long
statement
of
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
didn't
even
argue
it,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
don't
think
they
meant
to.
judge
mulvey
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
have
that.
he
said
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
sir?
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
your
honor.
he
--
he
really
talked
about
it
but
he
said
that
--
and
it
hasn't
been
raised.
it's
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
and
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
first
time
it
was
brought
up.
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
record
and
all
this
record
--
in
this
brief
that
mr.
isaacson
had
here.
there's
nothing
like
that.
now,
there's
a
question
involved
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
the
record
shows
that
they
ask
for
an
election.
and
after
they
had
the
strike
and
did
29
strikes,
they
withdrew
their
request
for
an
election.
that
is
the
union
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
there
was
a
testimony
by
mr.
youngdahl.
in
taking
the
testimony,
i
asked
him
and
they
withdrawn
their
request
for
an
election.
i
think,
i'm
quoting
the
record
straight
and
that's
the
only
place
it
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
it
was
not.
only
that
one
--
one
statement
in
the
record,
mr.
justice,
it
was
--
it
had
one
statement
by
mr.
youngdahl
in
that
record.
i
can't
put
my
--
my
hand
on
it
now.
but
that's
the
only
place
in
the
record
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
election,
i
mean
any
testimony.
and
i
think
counsel
for
the
other
side
will
agree
to
that.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
can't
answer
that.
i
just
represented
the
rainfair
in
this
injunction
proceeding.
i
had
nothing
or
whatever
to
do
with
that.
but
as
i
understand
it
why
they
--
and
i'm
--
i'm
telling
you
from
--
your
honor,
from
just
as
i
understand
it
now.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
but
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
for
instance
they
claim
that
they
would
discriminate
against
because
they
weren't
permitted
to
vote
and
they
filed
83
charges
but
the
board
held
that
it
wasn't
to
discriminate
the
labor
board.
and
then
--
they
--
what
happened
to
them,
they
just
lost
the
election.
and
they
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
--
and
other
thing
had
happened
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
--
i
read
it
for
the
first
time
at
noon
today
that
they
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
that's
the
first
time
i've
seen
it
and
they
required
to
post
a
notice
to
some
but
they
went
on
and
they
finally
agreed
to
an
election.
and
then
here's
another
thing.
it
wasn't
29
that
went
out
on
a
strike.
what
was
the
management
supposed
to
do
under
the
arkansas
freedom
to
work
law?
79
of
them
or
80
of
them
wanted
to
work
and
they
had
a
right
to
ask
for
an
election.
the
management
asked
for
an
election
and
so
did
labor
and
finally
they
had
an
election
in
labor
law.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
am
i
sir?
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
wasn't
the
lawyer.
mr.
sorbello
(ph)
represented
them
at
that
time.
i
didn't
represent
them,
your
honor.
that's
an
actual
statement
of
fact.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
don't
think
it
did.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
but
it
--
i'll
tell
you
it
is
not
in
the
record.
it's
none
of
this
labor
business
in
this
record.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
well,
these
--
these
cases
that
i
cite
here.
i
--
i'll
try
to
--
i'll
try
to
come
under
the
--
the
police
power
of
the
state
where
the
exception
has
been
made
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
well,
take
--
i
think
united
auto
versus
wisconsin.
i
think
that
case
decided
here
in
1956
as
a
general
matter.
we
have
held
that
a
state
may
not
in
accordance
of
its
public
policy
enjoin
conduct
which
made
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
federal
statute.
but
our
post
taft-hartley
opinion
have
made
it
clear
that
this
general
rule
does
not
take
from
the
states,
file
to
prevent
mass
picketing,
violence,
overt
threats
of
violence.
now
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
well
in
the
sense
that
they
are
preempted
under
the
--
under
the
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
--
i
say
the
unfair
labor
practice
--
i
say
that
they're
entitled
to
be
enjoined
under
this
case
and
these
other
case
and
your
cases
because
its
intimidation
and
force
and
violence
and
mass
picketing
and
threatening,
that's
what
i'll
say
about
it
and
it's
not
protected.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
well,
it
would
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
this
was
(voice
overlap)
this
was
a
prosecution
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
haven't
any
--
i
haven't
to
any
cases
in
arkansas
where
they
have
been
enjoined.
i
can't
cite
you
to
any.
i
can
cite
these
cases
worthy
of
finding
that
this
law
--
these
different
things
that
you
say
to
people
constitute
to
breach
of
the
peace.
and
i
say
in
this
case
that
they
admitted
they
set
them
to
insult
them.
so
there's
no
dispute
in
the
question
of
fact
except
where
it
was
calculated
to
drive
them
to
anger.
and
then
i'd
like
to
bring
about
one
of
other
thing
and
that's
about
this
chaplinsky
case,
new
hampshire
about
(inaudible)
and
fighting
words
and
libelous
and
insulting
words.
they
in
their
brief,
they
tried
to
limit
that
case
to
causing
out
the
man
they'd
arrested.
now,
this
--
this
cantwell
case
and
the
chaplinsky
case
is
really
some
philosophy
in
both
those
cases.
in
other
words,
in
one
of
them
they
say,
the
very
utterance
of
which
causes
as
not
protected.
in
other
words,
there's
nothing
social,
no
information
conveyed
by
insults
and
fighting
words
and
they're
not
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
you
mean
in
my
brief?
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no.
that
--
that
was
raised
in
this
rubber
duck
case,
i
--
they
argue
there
it
was
forever
in
this
--
the
procedure
as
it's
pointed
out
in
my
--
in
our
brief
there
that
the
procedure
is
to
file
a
motion.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
it's
set
out
--
it
set
out
in
those
cases
that
i
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
those
three
cases
in
the
brief
it
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
they
just
filed
a
motion.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
as
i
understand
it,
it's
the
lower
court,
you
come
in
and
say
now,
we
are
not
doing
this
and
we
won't
--
the
court
modified
the
injunction
and
he
has
the
way
we
will
picket
and
i
understand
that's
the
way
--
that's
our
procedure
down
there.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
not
in
my
opinion.
i
think
they
could
come
in
tomorrow.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
they
would
have
to
show
that
they
were
--
were
not
going
to
intimidate
and
puncture
tires
and
throw
snakes
and
in
other
words,
they
will
go
and
they'd
come
in
and
show
how
they
are
going
to
picket
and
now
the
--
it
would
be
my
--
it's
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
the
court
sets
out
the
manner
in
which
they
will
picket.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
yes,
sir.
that's
the
way
i
understand
it
to
be,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
they
didn't
have
it
rented
for
30
days.
in
other
words,
they
--
they
rented
that
lot
for
30
days
so
they
--
i
guess
your
question
is
moot
on
that
because
they
just
leased
it
for
30
days.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
and
loitering.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
at
--
at
that
lot.
they
have
leased
a
lot
right
in
front
of
this
rainfair
for
30
days
and
paid
$10
for
the
lease.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
oh,
sure.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
sure.
if
it's
eminent
to
this
lot
right
across
from
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
it's
limited.
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice,
it's
limited
to
that
specific
lot.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
at
that
lot.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
that's
what
it
means.
yes,
sir,
that
one
lot
there
across
the
plant
that
they
put
the
tent
on
and
the
benches
and
the
--
and
their
seat.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no,
sir.
but
this
is
a
rather
unusual
place.
they
--
they
rented
this
right
across
from
the
lot
and
that's
where
all
the
trouble
started
with
coming
out
into
the
road
and
persistently
doing
these
things
from
this
piece
of
property.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
as
i
understand
it,
this
injunction
would
be
outstanding
against
these
people
until
it
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
that's
what
i
mean.
the
union
until
they
make
a
motion
to
modify.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
don't
think
it
would
impose
a
very
heavy
burden.
i
don't
personally
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
we've
got
to
find
a
judge
down
there
and
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
i
think
the
matter
is
lift
up
to
the
--
as
i
understand,
is
lift
up
to
the
lower
court
under
these
cases
i've
cited.
i
think
if
they'd
come
in
and
say
we
want
a
picket
and
we're
not
going
to
threaten
and
--
mr.
j.
l.
shaver,
sr.
no
more
snakes.
he
doesn't
like
that.
i
think
the
court
would
regulate
like
they
do
in
the
other
cases
and
tell
them
they
won't
picket.
they
picket
for
two
weeks
there
and
there
weren't
anything
done
about
it.
thank
you
very
much.
