mr.
isaacson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
revert
back
to
the,
what
you
call
settlement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
use
of
word
“settlement”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
happened
--
what
--
is
there
anything
more
to
say
about
the
relation
of
the
employees
or
more
particularly
the
union,
the
local
as
i
--
the
local
of
amalgamated,
is
there
a
local
down
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tell
us
or
outside
the
record
that
is
or
as
it
could
be
put
to
the
court,
it
is
relevant
and
to
what
the
--
what
are
the
more
detailed
facts
and
consequences
of
this
settlement
are,
as
you
call
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
court,
as
i
am
in
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
being
--
the
injunction
was
when?
1955?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
settlement
followed
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you're
attacking
the
whole
injunction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
preemption
ground,
do
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
attacking
at
least
portions
--
these
portions
of
the
injunction
in
any
event
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
any
event
--
in
any
event,
you
go
further
and
say
in
any
event,
what
justice
burton
had
referred
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
your
final
retirement
of
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
who
was
the
settlement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
union
isn't
mentioned
in
the
settlement?
may
i
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
suggest
this?
in
as
much
as
you
say,
as
you're
arguing
for
all
i
know,
quite
correctly,
i'm
not
suggesting
in
contrary.
in
as
much
as
you
have
just
considered
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
a
moot,
i
put
it
to
you
whether
it
isn't
appropriate
to
put
the
document
into,
lay
the
document
before
the
court
so
that
one
may
discuss
so
considered
this
question
in
the
light
of
the
document
which
you
reject
to
proving
nothing
--
rejecting
mootness.
i'm
not
saying
it
is
moot.
i'm
not
--
all
i'm
saying
is
the
question
has
been
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
as
whether
you
shouldn't
--
this
is
a
proper
document
to
put
to
the
court.
perhaps
at
your
observations
that
you
just
made
and
the
respondent's
observation.
what
the
bearing
of
this
settlement
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
it
was
a
voluntary
or
whether
the
union
did
come
or
not.
i'm
not
--
the
slightest
thought
on
the
subject
in
my
mind.
the
questions
are
raised
that
you
yourself
know
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
is
clear
as
to
the
number
of
pickets?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
give
the
number
of
the
pickets?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
put
together.
i
suppose
all
the
facts
must
be
gathered
from
the
testimony
so
the
court
--
just
to
meet
a
general
finding
in
a
degree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
counsel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
trial
court,
paragraph
1
is
a
general
--
what
i
call
a
general
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
counsel
have
found
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
as
to
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
forced
way
of
violence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
your
--
what
--
what
your
interesting
argument
occurs
in
my
mind
is
to
whether
that
you
--
unless
you
really,
the
ultimate
reach
of
what
you're
arguing,
ultimately,
to
me
as
your
argument
was
that
you
really
ought
to
attack
the
right
--
constitutionality
of
the
right
to
work
statutes
because,
i
know
you're
not
making
that
argument
but
that's
what
it
gets
down
to.if
arkansas
and
other
state
passed
a
statute
of
a
rigorous
kind
that
they
do
whereby
they
want
not
only
to
have
no
coercion
by
the
employer
but
also
affirmatively
as
it
were,
keep
the
line
very
free
for
a
fellow
who
doesn't
want
to
join
the
--
a
good
reason
or
a
bad
reason
or
even
different
reason
that
he
shouldn't
be
persuaded
in
that
by
--
i
think
that
i'm
dealing
this
argument
from
the
paper
or
in
books
or
in
legal
periodicals
or
journals.
but
the
fact
you
--
that
you
reiterate
this
is
a
small
town
to
withdraw.
the
smallness
has
in
effect
the
other
way
around
in
a
community
in
which
the
policy
of
the
state
is
or
it
is
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
--
and
if
the
state
say
that
is
its
policy
and
the
people
who
want
to
enforce
that
policy
or
like
that
policy
are
to
get
out
obstructions
put
in
their
way
that
may
recently
be
deemed
by
the
state
of
the
obstruction.
it
may
not
fit
in
here
an
independent
judgment
as
to
the
--
whether
they
are
or
aren't.
it
is
merely
a
question
that
you
must
prove
coercion,
what
you
call
coercion,
violence,
is
that
all
there's
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying,
i'm
not
shutting
you
off
from
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
(voice

and
referring
to
a
woman's
condition
etcetera,
etcetera.
that
isn't
just
dissuading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
has
found
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
of
assistance
and
--
an
accumulative
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
saying
--
just
saying
“would
you
please,
in
your
country
or
in
your
long
reign
of
self-interest
consider
whether
it
isn't
desirable
for
you
to
join
the
union.”
that
isn't
what
this
is
and
i'm
not
saying
that
i
haven't
--
as
i
have
written
at
least
one
opinion
to
reveal
of
sympathy,
what
you
say
about
--
what
are
the
usual
terms.
what
we
are
dealing
here
was
a
large
policy
of
a
state
which
for
all
i'm
concerned
has
been
attacked?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
operating
under
a
statute
like
this
which
the
state
deems
as
the
desirable
authorized
policy
of
the
state.
he
was
just
dealing
with
common
law
question
of
granting
on
denying
an
injunction
which
is
a
very
different
story.
he
wasn't
passing
on
the
constitutional
power
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
quite
a
quoter
himself,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
quoted
a
lot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
preemption,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
shaver,
if
your
supreme
court
in
fact
--
if
your
supreme
court
had
said
you
can't
raise
these
question
for
the
first
time
before
us,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
that
would
have
been
one
thing,
but
your
supreme
court
passed
on
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
but
they
--
they
accepted
the
issue
and
dealt
with
it
on
the
merits,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
rejected
it
but
they
--
they
rejected
the
validity
of
the
argument
but
they
considered
it
and
passed
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
talking
about
it,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
talked
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
inferring
that
you
--
you
are
the
lawyer
for
rainfair
inc.?
is
that
a
fair
inference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
the
lawyer
--
that
you
are
the
lawyer
for
this
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
must
say
and
maybe
it's
just
my
curiosity
that
speaks
about
a
settlement
in
a
factory
and
neither
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
of
the
company
doesn't
know
anything
about
it
and
counsel
for
the
--
for
the
union
says
he
doesn't
know
--
the
union
wasn't
a
party
to
it.
i
wonder
with
whom
this
settlement
was
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
person
to
blame
if
you
were
or
weren't
but
i
thought
you're
the
counsel
in
this
case
and
you
said
this,
the
first
time
you
read
of
this
settlement?
mr.
isaacson
said
that
the
union
isn't
the
party
to
it.
i
just
wonder
whether
this
settlement
came
out
of
the
sky.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
it
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
small
town
for
those
who
would
love
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
could
they
tomorrow
if
--
if
you'll
excuse
me,
if
i
show
ignorance
about
that
kind
of
a
small
town,
though
i
envy
you
and
practically
in
a
city
in
which
you
know
everybody.
could
they
tomorrow
hire
a
building
and
meet
there
not
at
this
lot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
be
endangered
being
within
this
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
may
i
ask
you.
i
didn't
wholly
hear
the
colloquy
between
you
and
my
brother
brennan.
certainly,
if
tomorrow
another
factory
opens
at
wynne,
this
injunction
would
have
no
relation
to
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
asked
you
about
the
perpetuity
of
the
order
in
relation
to
rainfair.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
if
two
years
from
now,
rainfair
grows,
(inaudible)
it
will
be
able
to
grow
maybe
you
don't
want
it
to.
i'm
not
a
great
believer
in
the
growth
if
that's
(inaudible).
will
this
injunction
still
be
outstanding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
plus
the
--
plus
the
amount
--
plus
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
they
make
a
motion
to
modify,
they
would
in
effect
have
to
prove
or
satisfy
the
court
that
they're
good
boys
now,
wouldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
kind
of
a
burden
does
that
impose
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
there's
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
anything
in
--
in
the
procedure
in
your
--
either
statute
or
arkansas
(inaudible)
as
you'd
call
them
that
indicates
the
reasonable
reliance
that
they
wouldn't
have
to
carry
an
excessive
burden
--
a
heavy
burden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
more
snakes.
