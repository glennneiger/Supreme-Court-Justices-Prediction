mr.
william
j.
isaacson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
under
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
petitioners
here
are
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
of
america,
the
labor
organization
and
10
individuals.
three
of
these
individuals
are
representatives
of
the
amalgamated
or
are
employed
by
it.
seven
of
these
petitioners
are
employees
of
the
rainfair,
incorporated,
a
company
involved
in
this
proceeding
and
made
application
for
membership
to
be
amalgamated
and
designated
it
as
their
bargaining
representative.
rainfair,
the
company
here,
has
two
plants.
one
of
which
is
in
the
racine,
wisconsin
and
one,
in
wynne,
arkansas,
a
small
community
in
the
eastern
half
of
that
state.
if
the
plant
in
wynne,
arkansas
which
is
involved
in
this
proceeding
and
only
that
plant,
as
to
that
--
as
to
the
fact
that
rainfair
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
denial
of
it,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
submitted
in
this
brief
of
my
opponent
in
behalf
of
rainfair.
the
company
at
wynne,
arkansas
employees,
time
is
a
controversy,
came
into
being
some
107
people,
predominantly
women.
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
which
i
have
come
in
a
moment
which
is
the
key
question
here,
there
were
some
87
people,
80
of
whom
were
women.
throughout
all
of
the
proceeding
here,
i
shall
discuss
that
the
plant
was
mostly
women.
now,
the
injunction
issued
by
a
trial
court
(inaudible)
from
engaging
in
any
activity
at
--
engaged
near
the
plant
of
rainfair
(inaudible).
this
included
or
this
precluded
rather,
the
picketing
that
precluded
assembly
on
a
vacant
lot
across
these
premises
and
it
precluded
any
form
of
speech
near
the
plant.
this
injunction
was
challenged
by
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
below
on
two
basic
grounds
and
the
court
below
--
the
court
--
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
a
challenge
was
made
on
the
ground
that
this
injunction
contravene
this
assembly,
that
the
petitioner
held
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
secondly,
an
independent
ground,
it
was
challenged
on
the
ground
of
the
supreme
court
that
the
trial
court
here
had
cut
across,
interferes
with
protected
activities
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
had
taken
upon
itself
the
function
of
the
labor
board,
function
exclusively
that
of
the
labor
board
to
cross
this
unfair
labor
practice.
on
march
19,
1956,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
upheld
and
affirmed
the
injunctions
which
i
described,
primarily
and
substantially
on
the
ground
of
striking
in
their
activities
during
a
strike
from
june
20
to
june
24,
had
a
view
in
strike
breakers
and
is
the
views
to
perform
substantially
of
calling
the
strike
breakers
scabs
and
variance
of
that
term.
there
--
the
complaint
by
the
company
in
the
trial
court
on
which
the
ex
parte
injunction
first
granted
and
finally
the
permanent
injunction,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
objective
of
these
activities
were
illegal
under
arkansas
law,
first,
that
it
was
contrary
to
their
right
to
work
constitutional
amendment
in
enabling
statute,
and
that
also
that
these
activities
were
illegal
because
they
were
for
the
purposes
of
coercing
the
employee
to
join
an
organization
or
rather
coercing
the
employer,
coerce
the
employee
to
join
the
organization
contrary
to
their
desires.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
which
is
the
only
court
in
petition
in
the
opinion
in
this
proceeding,
did
not
find
either
of
the
objectives
to
be
illegal.
it
did
not
discuss
it
in
terms
of
objective.
the
supreme
court
in
arkansas
found,
as
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
that
we
raised.
they
found
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
protect
these
activities
here
because
as
they
say
the
act
of
--
even
if
they
conceded
that
the
acts
of
violence
involved
here
fall
in
that
category,
the
category
of
isolated
episodic
act,
there
was
nothing
isolated
or
infrequent
about
persistent
abuse,
insults,
etiquette
along
the
picket
line.
many
jurisdictions
have
authorized
such
injunctions
with
the
strikers'
acts
and
conduct
had
been
so
entangled
with
violence,
another
illegal
conduct,
that
future
excesses
might
reasonably
be
anticipated
in
light
of
what
is
previously
done.
the
conduct,
as
i
initially
stated,
to
which
this
court
makes
reference
at
this
point
was
substantially
and
basically
the
calling
of
the
strike
breakers
as
they
entered
and
left
the
plant,
scabs
and
variance
of
that
term.
the
court,
so
far
as
the
preemption
question
is
concerned,
said
that
while
they
realized
that
the
ultimate
decision
would
have
to
be
made
by
this
court.
then
went
on
to
say,
so
far
the
state
courts
had
been
unanimous
in
holding
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
preclude
them
from
granting
injunctive
relief
against
picketing
in
a
manner
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law.
until,
otherwise
told,
we
shall
assume
that
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
federal
act
to
deprive
a
state
court
of
its
ancient
jurisdiction
in
such
matters.
these
are
the
basic
holdings
of
the
court
on
which
this
all
embrace
the
injunction
was
granted.
now,
the
facts
which
led
up
to
the
strike
which
is
an
issue
here
are
briefly
these.
in
the
early
part
of
1955,
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers
proceeded
to
attempt
to
organize
these
employees,
at
that
organization
met
with
some
success
that
demonstrated
in
a
number
of
ways.
the
organization
by
april
was
in
a
position
where
they
thought
they
could
go
to
the
employer
and
make
a
request
for
exclusive
recognition
as
a
bargaining
agent
and
there
is
evidence
that
during
a
--
peace
meeting
with
the
employer,
they
stated
that
they
represent
the
majority
of
the
employees
as
many
as
80.
the
employer,
however,
sought
it
not
to
recognize
the
union
and
instead
engaged
in
what
the
petitioner,
amalgamated,
regarded
as
unfair
labor
practices
because
on
april
the
5th,
charges
were
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
at
the
sub-regional
office
of
memphis
to
the
--
tennessee,
to
the
effect
that
these
activities
constitute
on
the
part
of
the
company
in
response
to
the
union's
organizational
campaign
and
request
for
recognition,
constituted
interference,
straight
coercion
in
the
terms
of
statute.
subsequently,
sometime
in
the
month
of
april,
there
was
a
petition
for
an
election
filed
by
the
amalgamated.
this
petition,
however,
withdrawn
in
the
light
of
what
the
organization,
the
amalgamated,
considered
to
be
the
unfair
labor
practices
continuation
of
those
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
apparently,
there
was
a
feeling
that
it
could
not
be
an
untrammeled
choice
at
this
particular
time
in
the
light
of
these
unfair
labor
practices.
on
the
2nd
of
may,
there
was
a
strike
called
by
the
amalgamated,
29
persons
went
out
on
that
strike.
the
day
that
the
strike
was
called,
the
employer
countered
with
a
letter
to
the
strikers,
to
the
effect
that
if
they
did
not
return
to
work,
that
they
--
places
would
be
failed,
and
there
will
be
no
jobs
for
them.
as
the
result
of
this
letter,
some
three
persons
did
return
to
work,
the
other
26
continued
on
strike
until
may
the
19th,
when
the
realization
came
upon
the
organization
and
these
persons
were
a
part
of
--
of
this
strike,
that
this
was
not
a
strike
which
could
be
successful.
on
that
day,
they
abandoned
the
strike.
so,
advised,
the
employer
of
the
strike
was
abandoned
and
asked
that
all
of
these
persons
be
reinstated.
the
company
was
so
apprised
of
that
fact
on
the
19th
of
may.
the
company,
however,
although
that
they
had
not
replaced
all
of
these
persons,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
hired
some
13
persons,
the
testimony
developed
in
the
proceeding
before
the
trial
court.
although
they
hired
some
13
persons,
they
nevertheless
sought
it
not
to
take
on
any
of
these
people.
as
a
result
of
this,
additional
charges
were
filed,
amended
charges
were
filed
broadening
the
initial
charge
to
include
an
83
on
the
ground
of
--
there
had
been
discrimination
in
view
of
the
company's
refusal
to
reinstate
these
particular
persons
when
they've
made
their
offer,
after
their
sort
of
activity
have
come
to
end.
and
there
was
an
additional
charge
filed
between
the
charge,
the
general
interference,
and
the
restrain
charge
and
that
which
i
now
described
of
a
refusal
of
bargain
in
the
interval.
so,
by
this
time
on
june
the
6th,
we
have
charges
now
of
interference
restraint
and
coercion,
refusal
of
bargain
and
discrimination
by
virtue
of
this
failure
to
reinstate
--
refusal
to
reinstate
of
these
persons,
these
15
persons
were
part
of
the
26
on
the
strike.
the
company
nevertheless,
did
not
reinstate
any
of
these
employees
and
consequently,
on
june
the
28th,
the
union
went
out
on
strike
again.
i
say
consequently
because
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
dispute
that
the
union
strike
on
june
the
20th
was
because
of
the,
that
they
consider
it
to
be
the
company's
unfair
labor
practice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
brief
of
the
company,
it's
described
in
this
way
on
pages
3
and
4
of
the
brief
of
the
company,
described
this
way.
bottom
page
3,
on
june
17,
1955
the
strikers
met
with
several
staff
members
of
the
union
of
forrest
city
arkansas
and
vote
to
reestablish
the
picket
line
because
rainfair
refused
to
reinstate
the
strikers
or
for
continuing
unfair
labor
practices.
the
strike
which
began
on
june
the
20th
and
which
terminated
on
june
24th
on
an
ex
parte
injunction
is
the
only
strike
and
only
picketing
activity
which
is
before
--
which
was
before
the
court
in
arkansas,
and
now
before
this
court.
the
--
at
this
strike,
we
do
not
have
the
precise
numbers
that
engaged
these
strikes.
it
was
a
presumably,
something
less
told
than
the
26
employees
who
have
not
been
reinstated
because
some
of
these
26
had
gone
off
to
other
job.
there
are
no
additional
adherence
to
this
strike
activity
at
this
time.
so,
there
was
something
less
than
26
employees
who
are
now
out
on
strike.
this
strike
continued
until,
as
i
said,
until
the
24th,
when
the
ex
parte
injunction
was
granted
--
granted
on
the
faces
of
a
verified
complaint,
verified
by
the
plant
manager
and
according
to
the
record,
oral
testimony
by
the
plant
manager.
there
was
a
hearing
held
on
this
injunction
on
the
1st
of
july,
and
on
september
the
15th,
this
injunction
was
made
permanent.
on
the
15th
also,
and
i
refer
to
this
only
because
the
point
that
was
made
in
the
brief
of
counsel
for
the
company,
they
also
dismissed
a
contempt
by
taking,
which
had
been
heard
on
july
the
20th
against
two
youngsters
who
had
broken
some
bottles
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant
sometime
during
the
month
of
july.
and
this
--
after
--
after
the
strike
was
concluded
and
that
the
--
this
activity
was
in
contempt
with
the
court
decree.
the
court
did
not
find
so
however.
however,
there
is
in
fact
some
reference
to
it,
some
lengths,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
brief
for
the
company
here.
at
this
point,
faced
now
with
the
september
the
15th,
faced
with
a
permanent
injunction
and
realizing
and
recognizing
that
there
would
be
tending
delay
on
appellate
review
in
the
state
court.
the
union
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
thing
that
could
salvage
out
of
this
proceeding,
was
to
go
to
an
immediate
election.
this
--
they
decided
to
do,
and
there
was
a
stipulation
for
an
election.
on
that
--
on
that,
election
held
on
october
the
19th,
some
57
people
voted
against
the
union
and
48
people
voted
for
the
union
even
though,
there
has
been
an
injunction
in
effect
for
all
these
several
months.
nevertheless,
there
were
some
48
persons,
who
still
adhere
to
their
original
affiliation
with
the
organization.
some
15
persons
voted
what
the
board
refers
to
as
challenged
ballots
that
as
they're
committed
to
vote
but
their
ballots
are
--
their
ballots
are
sequestered
from
the
ballots
to
which
no
challenge
was
made
and
helpful
examination.
these
challenge
ballots
were
subsequently,
several
months
later,
not
to
be
entitled
to
vote.
as
i've
said
on
march
the
19th,
in
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
affirmed
the
injunction
of
the
lower
court.
subsequently,
to
the
affirmation
of
the
injunction,
the
last
act,
when
the
proceeding,
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
took
place
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
settlement
of
the
charges
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
amended,
a
settlement
providing
with
the
--
the
posting
of
a
notice
on
the
bulletin
board
of
the
company
and
that
notice
provided
that
the
company
would
not
interfere,
restrain
or
coerce
the
employees,
would
not
interrogate
the
employees
and
that
it
would
not
permit
the
wynne
industrial
development
corporation,
a
group
of
businessmen
in
wynne,
to
use
the
premises
of
the
company
for
purpose
of
interference
and
restraint
and
they
would
not
hold
them
out
as
the
agents
of
the
company.
obviously,
i
cannot
give
this
court,
that
it's
not
a
matter
of
record,
the
precise
detail
which
led
up
to
the
settlement
that
prompt
the
company
to
enter
into
this
kind
of
settlement
at
that
time.
that
is
not
before
the
--
that
is
not
before
us
now
because
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
proceeding.
have
there
been
a
labor
board
proceeding
and
undoubtedly
it
would
have
been
made
a
--
a
part
of
a
formal
transcript.
now,
as
to
the
precise
--
as
to
the
strike
itself
to
which
the
challenge
is
made
by
the
employer
in
its
complaint.
as
i've
said,
there
would
--
there
was
a
picketing
--
there
was
picketing
in
may
of
1955,
may
the
2nd,
may
19th
which
was
brought
to
an
end
by
the
realization
that
the
strike
could
not
succeed.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
it's
the
settlement
to
which
the
employer
was
a
party,
under
which
they
agree
with
the
labor
board,
the
regional
director
of
the
labor
board
to
post
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
they
would
not
interfere
that
the
--
the
notices
in
the
normal
standard
fourth
language
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
there
is
none.
it's
just
the
--
there
is
no
local
in
the
area
there.
this
is
a
--
an
area
in
which
this
was
the
wholly
plant,
as
i've
come
to
in
a
moment.
so
we
have
no
local
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
unfortunately,
justice
frankfurter,
in
these
cases
which
do
not
proceed
through
the
board,
the
state
court
has
very
little
interest
in
going
into
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
there
are
unfair
labor
practices
on
the
part
of
the
employer
in
determining
what
revenue,
if
any,
they
should
make
against
the
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
the
union.
so,
nothing
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
nothing
--
yes.
but
nothing
was
brought
out.
this
is
my
point
nothing
was
brought
out
in
the
state
court
proceeding,
concerning
the
fact
underlying
this
settlement
agreement.
the
settlement
agreement,
i
have
a
copy
of
it
here
and
a
part
of
the
formal
government
file
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
settlement
agreement
was
approved
on
march
the
21st,
1956.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
the
injunction
was
1955.
march
the
19th,
1956,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
affirmed
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
followed
the
(inaudible).
this
was
the
--
the
last
act
and
this
point,
there's
nothing
left
to
be
done.
this
strike
comes
to
an
end
really
on
july
--
on
june
the
24th
of
the
year
previously
--
and
that
really
was
the
end
of
the
union's
activities
here
in
which
they
have
a
real
understanding
but
nevertheless
it
went
through
the
formalities
and
that's
all
that
there
were
after
that
injunction
was
issued.
there
were
nothing
more
than
formalities,
it
went
through
the
formalities
of
the
court
proceeding
but
there
could
not
be
at
that
point
and
in
vindication
of
the
rights
under
the
statue.
both
rights
had
been
irreparably
and
irrevocably
taken
away
from
them.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
we
attack
--
we
attack
the
entire
injunction,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
there
was
no
basis
for
any
part
of
the
injunction.
alternatively
though
in
our
brief
we
make
the
point
that
even
the
state
court
had
the
power
in
the
terms
of
preemption
question,
had
the
power
to
enjoin
the
activities,
the
calling
of
the
strike
breakers,
scabs
and
variations
of
that
term
even
if
they
have
that
power,
they
have
no
power
over
the
rest
of
the
controversy.
in
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
say
that
even
if
they
have
the
power
to
enjoin
that
activity,
which
i
described,
they
certainly
had
no
power
to
enjoin
anything
else,
the
peaceful
activity.
so,
we
argue
in
the
alternative
to
that
extent.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
we
are
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
we
attack
it
on
the
preemption
ground.
that
is
right.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
with
this
--
with
this
--
correction,
your
honor.
we
attack
the
entire
injunction
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
too,
because
we
claim
that
this
right,
we
claim
the
right
on
the
part
of
the
strikers,
calling
strike
breakers,
scabs
and
variations
of
that
term.
we
claim
this
part
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
guaranteed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
that
is
right.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
i
am
to
this
--
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
because
i
feel
that
when
you've
developed
this
proceeding
and
show
the
alternating
proceedings
before
the
labor
board
and
before
the
court
at
the
state
court
in
arkansas,
you
understand
fully
and
get
the
full
flavor
of
the
enmeshment
here
of
the
proceedings
before
the
labor
board
and
before
the
state
court
particularly
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would.
it
doesn't
read
--
it
doesn't
say
that
it
would
made
prejudice
simply
it's
withdrawn
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
we
would
now
be
precluded
by
--
we
would
now
be
precluded
by
the
taft-hartley
statute
of
limitations,
a
six-month
statute
of
limitations
that
we
could
no
longer
reinstitute
these
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
no,
not
all,
because
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
very
time
at
the
--
at
the
most
critical
period
in
the
union's
campaign
the
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
the
election
--
the
election
itself.
they
were
under
the
heaviest
of
restraint
from
engaging
in
any
activities
at
the
most
critical
place,
the
most
decisive
place
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
--
in
many
decisions
near
the
plant
premises.
this
is
a
small
community
in
which
most
of
the
persons
drive
to
work
and
the
place
where
they
can
be
most
effectively
organized
is
at
or
near
the
plant
and
it
was
here
from
which
we
were
precluded
from
taking
any
of
the
activities,
which
i've
described
as
falling
under
the
state
court
restraints.
so,
it's
hardly
moot
because
the
most,
as
i've
said,
the
most
critical
period
in
union's
organizational
campaign.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
may
i
say
this?
that
point,
we
weren't
a
party
to
the
settlement
at
this
point,
that
there
was
little
that
we
could
do
in
any
event
(voice

are
not

long
and

as
quickly
as
i
can.
but
as
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
but,
coming
back
to
justice
brennan's
point,
i'll
say
this,
repeat
that
at
the
time
the
injunction
was
in
effect
was
the
critical
time,
so
far
as
the
union
organization
is
concerned
and
when
we
came
through
the
test
at
the
ballot
box
which
we
thought
compelled
to
go
into
at
that
time
because
we
have
no
other
recourse.
we
were
enjoined
to
take
any
other
step.
we
have
no
record
what
to
perceive
or
what
we
thought
would
be
a
very
poor
(inaudible)
and
effort
there,
we
proceeded
with
this
heavy
restraint
of
an
injunction
upon
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
precluding
all

mr.
william

so
far
as
i
can
tell
from
this
copy
which
i
have,
before
me
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
no.
the
union
doesn't
have
to
consent
on
this
(voice

--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
no.
it
did
not
consent,
so
far
as
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
we
did
not
take
in
--
we
did
not
take
an
appeal
from
the
general
counsel
from
the
settlement.
we
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
we
did
object
to
it
at
that
time.
we
did
not
take
an
appeal
or
to
the
general
counsel,
so
that
brought
--
that
brought
it
to
an
end
when
there
was
no
field
taken.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
injunction
here
in
which
the
court
below
affirmed
the
injunction.
that
is
the
strike
and
picketing
which
began
on
june
the
20th,
1955.
picketing
was
by
one
or
two
pickets
in
front
of
the
rainfair
plant
and
they
carry
a
sign
which
read,
“rainfair
workers
on
strike,
rainfair
is
unfair
to
its
employees,
amalgamated
clothing
workers
of
america,
cio.”
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
there
is
no
challenge
--
there
is
no
challenge
as
to
the
picketing
itself
in
front
of
the
plant
premises,
none
whatsoever.
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
it
appears
all
the
pickets
themselves
did
was
carry
the
--
the
signs
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes,
one
to
two
--
one
to
two
at
each
entrance.
the
plant
is
located
on
a
corner
at
a
street,
rowena
street
and
there's
another
street
called
martin
drive,
intersecting
with
rowena
street
and
apparently
there
are
one
to
two
pickets
at
each
of
these
entrances.
normally
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
the
court
--
the
court
didn't
make
any
findings
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
the
trial
court
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes,
yes.
but
in
the
--
in
the
supreme
court,
however,
of
arkansas,
they
referred
to
the
one
of
the
two
pickets
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
take
any
exception
to
--
to
that
statement
part.
there
was
no
violence.
there's
no
threat
of
violence
and
that
as
far
as
we
--
as
i
said,
so
far
as
we
can
tell
there's
no
conduct
whatsoever
there.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
not
as
to
the
picketing
itself.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
oh,
now,
i
come
--
i
come
to
the
next
aspect
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
of
the
strike
activity.
yes.
i'm
talking
merely
now
with
the
pickets
themselves.
now,
the
next
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
activity
is
the
activities
in
the
part
of
the
strikers
on
a
vacant
lot,
strikers
and
representatives
of
the
amalgamated
on
a
vacant
lot
across
the
street
from
the
plant.
the
location
of
the
plant
was
on
rowena
street
and
martin
drive.
across
from
rowena
street,
there
was
a
vacant
lot
which
the
amalgamated
leaves
during
the
strike
as
strike
headquarters.
and
it
was
on
this
lot,
they
erected
a
tent,
they
serve
meals
to
the
pickets,
pickets
would
wait
there
for
their
turn
to
take
their
turn
at
picketing.
and
it
was
on
this
lot
too,
they
--
on
occasion,
they
would
meet
and
discuss
the
strike
and
how
it
was
going
and
there
was
a
telephone
there
too,
in
event,
they
had
telephone
from
the
strike
headquarters
anywhere
else.
now,
this
was
the
strike
headquarters
immediately
across
to
the
plant
and
it
was
here
that
we
find
that
persons,
the
amalgamated
testified
some
four
to
eight
would
gather
there
normally
times
a
few
more
than
10,
12,
14.
the
court
found
that
it's
high
as
35,
as
i
recollect,
gathered
at
this
place.
as
high
as
that
and
ranging
from
8
to
35
would
gather
on
this
vacant
lot.
the
street,
rowena
street
there
was
some
20
feet
wide.
there
are
some
questions
as
to
whether
there
was
a
ditch
on
both
sides
of
the
street.
the
record
doesn't
make
it
absolutely
clear
but
there
is
at
least
one
ditch
of
some
10
feet
on
one
side
of
the
--
on
one
side
of
rowena
street.
so,
there's
at
least
30
feet
separating
the
vacant
lot
and
the
plant
premises.
the
plant
gave
itself
to
some
35
to
40
feet
from
the
--
from
the
street
and
the
tent
itself
on
the
vacant
lot
was
approximately
40
to
50
feet
from
the
--
from
the
lot
line.
it
was
here
that
the
strikers
would
gather
and
if
--
if
this
conduct
that
particularly
challenged
by
the
court.
the
strikers
would
gather
there
and
they
would
--
they
would
sing
the
songs
that
are
traditional
to
the
picket
line.
these
songs
are
the
--
one
of
the
songs
to
which
the
court
made
reference,
it
was
“when
the
saints
come
marching
in”
was
changed
to
“when
the
scabs
come
marching
in.”
this
is
normal
with
picket
lines
normally,
as
we
--
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
it's
to
take
songs
which
are
religious
songs
and
which
groups
can
sing
on
the
favor,
appealing
and
to
convert
them
into
union
song.
this
particular
song
is
--
as
the
record
discloses,
turned
out
to
be
duke
box
favored
about
that
particular
time
and
was
used
the
another
one
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
no.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
i
am
asking
(voice
overlap)
as
far
as
the
coercion,
the
intimidation,
and
calculated
the
cause,
breaches
of
the
peace.
yes.
we
are
asking
this
court.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
to
go
behind
that
and
this
court
has
done
that
in
numerous
occasions
with
constitutional
issues
that
are
brought
into
question.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes,
i
--
i
am.
and
what
--
but
if
we
come
though,
as
we
come
to
the
question
here,
you'll
see
that
the
court
--
the
court
below
does
not
rely
on
the
so-called
incidence
of
violence.
the
court
below
pays
rather
special
and
careful
attention
to
the
picket
line
activity
as
described
on
the
vacant
lot
to
wit
the
singing
and
the
calling
to
the
strike
breakers
as
they
enter
the
plant.
the
court
particularly,
the
court
below
particularly
states
--
i'm
--
i'm
reading
on
page
202
of
the
record
and
the
first
complete
paragraph,
“it
is
true
that
an
injunction
prohibiting
all
picketing
may
not
be
based
on
isolated
and
episodic
acts
of
violence
or
other
unlawful
conduct.”
even
if
it
would
be
conceded
that
the
acts
of
violence
involved
here,
fall
in
that
category
and
they
then
proceed
to
go
on
into
the,
a
holding
which
i
read
to
the
court
in
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
so,
the
court
doesn't
rely
on
these
so-called
acts
of
violence,
to
which
i
will
come
in
a
moment
to
this
so-called
acts
of
violence.
they
relied
particularly
and
principally
on
the
strikers
calling
across
the
street
to
the
strike
breakers
as
they
entered
and
left
the
plant
that
they
were
scabs
and
variations
of
that
word.
and
as
to
the
songs,
they
mentioned
the
fact,
there
were
this
song
--
there
was
this
song
that
i've
just
referred
to
when
the
scabs
go
marching
in
and
also,
they
took
the
song
“davy
crockett”
and
--
and
utilized
it
there
to
the
striker's
purpose
--
to
the
striker's
purpose
thereto
and
we
have
the
--
we
have
the
language
of
that
in
our
brief.
now,
the
thing
that
the
court
drew
particular
attention
to
and
which
throughout
the
trial
of
the
case
was
the
main
thing
was
that
it
--
as
the
people
would
come
in
and
go
out
of
the
plant,
these
persons,
numbering
from
8
to
37
in
terms
of
the
court
and
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
go
behind
that
finding.
numbering
somewhere
between
8
to
37
would
stand
and
would
--
would
shout
to
the
strike
breakers
as
they
would
walk
in.
they
would
--
they
would
as
the
court
below
found,
used
such
terms
as
“fat
scabs,”
“yellow
scabs,”
“pony
tailed
scabs,”
“crazy
scabs,”
“cotton
patch
scabs,”
and
“fuzzy
headed
scabs.”
on
a
few
occasions,
the
court
below
noted,
the
strikers
were
referred
to
as
“fools,”
or
“cotton
picking
fools.”
these
were
relevantly
few
occasions
as
the
court
makes
perfectly
claim.
so,
we
come
down
then
to
using
these
word
“scab.”
i
assume
that
this
is
a
qualifying
adjective
which
drew
the
attention
or
ire
of
the
court
and
brought
down
this
injunction.
presumably,
it's
the
one
word,
that
word
is
“scab.”
now,
nowhere
in
the
court's
findings
is
there
any
indication,
if
there's
any
obscenity,
there's
no
profanity,
no
rudeness
of
any
kind,
must
be
remembered
also,
as
i've
stated
at
the
very
outset,
they
were
women
talking
with
women.
the
--
there's
no
real
question
here
--
there's
no
real
question
here
of
any
fear
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
strike
breakers.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
careful
reading
of
the
record
as
demonstrated
that
as
far
as
any
of
the
employees
who
walked
across
that
picket
line,
day
in
and
day
out
for
these
four
days
that
not
one
of
them
testified
that
they're
reporting
fear
of
physical
safety,
not
one.
the
only
evidence
along
those
lines
comes
from
the
plant
manager
without
any
support
whatsoever.
but
not
one
of
the
employees
stated
that
she
was
put
in
fear
of
physical
safety
by
the
women
across
the
street
shouted
at
them.
now,
throughout
the
strike,
throughout
these
four
days,
all
of
these
strike
breakers
continued
to
walk
in
and
out
of
that
plant
just
as
they
customarily
did.
they
came
down
to
rowena
street,
which
is
the
street
on
which
the
vacant
lot
is
located
where
they
could
have
used
martin
drive
have
they
had
any
feeling
there,
as
they
have
any
feeling
that
they
were
disturbed
about
coming
into
that
plant
but
they
did
not.
they
came
to
--
where
they
normally
came
and
it
was
down
rowena
street
they
would
come
across
the
--
as
they
came
down
to
rowena
street,
they
would
turn
over
a
ditch
and
park
with
their
--
the
front
end
of
their
car
right
at
the
building
line
of
the
plant
there.
they
would
leave
their
cars,
in
other
words,
on
rowena
street
right
across
to
where
the
strikers
were
located,
no
fear
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
the
lunch
hour,
they
would
go
out
and
they
will
have
their
lunch
at
the
--
at
the
street
there
and
that
there's
no
violence
here.
that
there
was
no
violence
whatsoever
in
connection
to
this
picket
line
or
with
the
activities
on
this
vacant
lot
as
demonstrated
from
the
plant
manager's
testimony
at
the
trial
and
also
from
testimony
of
the
chief
of
police,
who
said
that
he
had
been
there
everyday,
he
would
go
down
there
everyday
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
never
an
arrest,
never
attempted
an
arrest
and
his
testimony
is.
now
chief
--
i'm
reading
from
page
14
of
our
brief
and
it's
153
in
the
record,
that
this
particular
question
and
answer
took
place.
he
said,
“now,
chief,
you
don't
know
of
any
actual
violence
having
occurred
down
there,
do
you?
do
you
know
any?”
and
the
answer
is
“no,
sir.
we
have
none.”
this
is
the
chief
of
police
of
wynne.
as
to
the
plant
manager
and
this
is
also
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
126
in
the
record.
now,
mr.
bonady,
when
the
picket
line
was
thrown
up
the
second
time,
do
you
know
of
any
actual
incidents
of
violence
that
have
occurred
out
there
in
connection
with
the
picket
line?
you
are
talking
about
physical
violence?”
that's
the
answer.
“is
that
what
you
call
violence?”
question.
“yes,
physical
violence.”
answer,
“i've
never
observed
anybody.”
now,
this
comes
from
the
principal
witness
in
behalf
of
the
company,
the
plant
manager
and
on
behalf
of
the
chief
police
officer
of
the
community
in
which
the
strike
took
place.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
i'm
coming
to
that
sir.
at
that
the
moment,
i'm
developing
just
the
picket
line
activity
and
i'll
come
immediately
to
this
incidents
to
which
the
court
averted
on
which
it
did
not
rely
though,
as
i
put
it
out
before
in
support
of
its
injunction.
they
merely
adverted
to
it
and
the
current
purpose
i
assumed
practicing
their
--
their
general
opinion
here.
but
i
would
come
to
that,
if
--
if
you
--
if
you
will
in
just
one
moment.
now,
on
the
--
still
talking
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
picket
line,
every
precaution
was
taken
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
representatives
of
the
amalgamated
to
avoid
any
violence
because
they
did,
they
were
quite
conscious
of
the
fact
that
they
were
in
an
area
where
an
injunction
might
very
well
--
might
very
well
issue
and
they
did
not
--
they
want
to
be
perfectly
playing
that
there
would
not
be
anything
that
could
smack
a
violence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
several
instances,
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
amalgamated
asked
the
chief
of
police
to
be
sure
and
be
there
just
to
check
up,
so
that
the
event,
if
his
testimony
wherever
necessary
to
any
proceeding,
he
could
tell
that
there
was
no
violence
whatsoever
in
connection
to
this
proceeding.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
chief
of
police
did
testify,
although
as
a
company
witness
that
there
was
none.
there
was
also
an
instruction
by
sign.
it
was
posted
on
the
--
on
the
vacant
lot
which
was
used
as
strike
headquarters
to
the
effect
that
there'd
be
no
violence
and
they
meant
this
completely.
they
meant
this
officially
and
unofficially
that
there
would
be
no
violence
whatsoever
or
any
threat.
now,
in
addition
to
court
refers
still
--
if
i
may,
on
the
picket
line
activities
themselves.
they
refer
to
two
incidents,
and
one
of
these
incidents
is
that
the
two
other
women
strikers
make
fun
of
the
pregnancy
of
a
strike
breaker.
this
could
take
place.
two
of
the
women
strikers
did
judge
a
--
one
of
the
strike
breakers
on
the
fact
she
was
pregnant.she
said
later
--
she
said,
“i
thought
i
was
friend
of
--
i
thought
they
were
friends
of
mine
before
this
thing
all
began
but
nevertheless,
this
is
what
they
did.”
she
did
not
feel
intimidated
about
it
and
she
felt
--
she
felt
somewhat
hurt
that
they
--
these
friends
of
hers
would
do
this
kind
of
a
thing
during
this
particular
period.
another
one
of
the
women
on
which
the
court
placed
a
very
heavy
reliant,
is
the
fact
that
one
of
the
women,
they
judge
with
one
of
the
women
about
the
fact
that
she
had
a
low-cut
dress
and
she
wore
a
big
earring.
the
court
felt
that
this
woman
felt
very
angry
as
the
result
of
this
and
that
she
felt
it's
necessary
to
work
because
she
had
children
to
support
and
she
took
very
unkindly
to
this
--
to
this
comment
that
is
made
to
her,
she
walked
in
and
out
of
the
picket
line.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
though
and
i
think
it
is
some
significance
to
show
the
lengths
to
which
this
court
went
to
support
this
all
embracing
injunction
and
how
little
--
how
little
there
really
is
in
this
record
of
anything
other
than
what
i
have
related
up
to
now.
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
--
the
testimony
of
a
particular
employee
in
question
that
appears
at
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief
at
146
and
147
of
the
record.
the
question,
“would
you--”
this
is
on
--
on
direct-examination
by
mr.
shaver,
who
was
counsel
for
the
company.
“could
you
please
tell
the
court
what
they
called
you?”
“well,
one
afternoon
i
left
as
i've
started
to
leave
the
plant
when
i
got
off
and
i
was
walking
by
the
warehouse
and
my
friends
always
parks
their
car
in
the
martin
side
drive
and
i
was
going
around
and
louis
morrison,
one
of
the
strikers
hollered,
“oh,
look.look
there
at
that
low-cut
dress
and
big
earring
girl”
and
the
speech
referring
to
the
manager
of
the
plant,
the
speech
“still
like
low-cut
dresses
and
earrings
and
i
said,
“i
don't
know,
you
will
have
to
ask
him”.
and
she
said,
“if
he
does,
i
think
i
would
get
me
one”
and
i
said,
“it
won't
do
you
any
good,
you
don't
have
anything
to
fill
it
up.”
now,
the
court
--
the
court
felt
this
woman
was
very
--
very
angry
and
this
is
one
of
the
--
this
is
one
of
the
main
incidents
outside
of
the
calling
of
--
of
scab
on
which
they
play
such
very
heavy
reliance.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
this
--
this
question
was
put
to
me
by
mr.
justice
burton
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
and
at
that
time,
i
said,
“no,
it
would
not.”
it
might
adhere
to
this
injunction
--
this
injunction
has
no
support
whatsoever.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
well,
this
is
the
practical
question,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
really
don't
feel
qualified
to
answer
now.
what
we
would
have
done
under
--
what
we
would
have
done
had
i
been
consulted
under
the
--
under
the
exigencies
of
the
moment.
i
don't
know.
i
feel
now
very
clearly
though
that
the
language
which
i
have
read
supported
by
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
this
doesn't
support
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
any
injunction.
this
is
my
point.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
no
injunction
whatsoever.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
i
want
to
make
that
point
very
plain
now.
it
doesn't
support
any
injunction
either
under
our
argument
that
contravenes
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
the
argument
that
it
contravenes
or
rather
it
cuts
across,
interferes
with
activity
which
are
permanently
protected
under
section
7
and
section
13
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
just
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
question?
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
my
point
is
that,
this
clearly
false
encompass
of
free
speech.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
and
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
yes.
and
i
--
and
i'll
come
to
that
point
right
now,
if
i
may,
because
the
question
is
does
this
--
does
this
speech
on
the
part
of
these
employees,
the
strikers,
does
it
--
actually,
the
court
below
found
coerced
and
intimidate.
does
is
it
calculated
or
the
breach
of
the
peace.
but
i
think
the
number
of
the
circumstances
here,
first
taking
the
empirical
demonstration
that
there
was
no
violence
--
there
was
no
outburst,
there
was
no
question
raised
at
all
here
during
the
activities.
i
think
this
go
as
far
to
show
that
this
--
this
was
pure
speech
in
this
particular
instance.
further,
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
here's
a
group,
a
small
minority
in
this
very
rural
community,
wynne,
arkansas,
who
have
just
recently
bonded
together
there,
to
get
for
themselves
higher
wages
in
condition
to
the
employment
through
a
labor
organization.
they
find
themselves
immediately
thrust
into
this
position
of
martyrdom.
they
are
discharged
from
the
plant.
under
these
circumstances,
the
only
way
that
they
can
really
begin
to
bolster
their
--
their
standing
there
at
all
--
if
not
to
standby
silently
as
the
strike
breakers
who
had
been
part
of
their
organization.
a
few
of
the
strike
breakers
testified
that
they
had
signed
this
card
but
nevertheless,
the
immediacy
of
the
moment,
the
need
for
--
the
need
for
food
as
one
of
the
woman
put
it,
made
her
go
through
this
--
through
this
picket
line.
i'm
sure
this
was
a
difficult
choice
for
her
to
make
and
was
a
very
difficult
thing
for
the
strike
--
for
the
strikers,
to
see
these
persons
who
had
been
part
of
their
group
activity
there
walking,
knowing
full
well
that
at
this
point,
they
were
now
embarked
on
very
forlorn
effort
because
this
company
has
not
be
turning
to
--
to
the
plant
and
they
knew
--
they
knew
then
that
very
little
chance
of
going
back
to
that
plant.
now,
the
persons
who
are
walking
into
the
plant
knew
that
they
had
the
support
of
the
employer,
the
single
employer
in
this
community,
which
is
a
powerful
support
in
a
small
area
where
there
aren't
any
other
employing
industries.
they
knew
that
they
have
the
support
of
the
wynne
industrial
development
corporation
of
businessmen
in
the
city.
they
knew
that
the
police
were
not
unfriendly
to
them.
they
came
--
they
came
in
there
completely
free
of
any
fear,
of
any
molestations,
of
intimidation,
of
coercion
of
any
kind,
and
the
fact
is
best
born
out
as
i
--
as
i
began
saying
by
the
--
this
empirical
demonstration
that
nothing
took
place.
no
one
ever
interfered
with
them
and
not
one
of
these
employees
by
the
way,
not
only
was
not
in
turn
going
into
the
plant.
not
one
of
these
employees
was
persuaded.
now,
this
may
show
that
this
argument
which
was
being
advanced
by
the
strikers,
through
the
strike
breakers
was
not
an
ineffective
one.
but
the
fact
that
ineffective
or
ineffectual
under
these
particular
circumstances
does
not
take
away
from
it,
its
constitutional
protections.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
if
i
may
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
may
i
say
this
--
may
i
say
this
in
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
you
used
the
term
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
permit
people
to
dissuade
these
persons
from
going
in.
at
one
point
in
your
question,
you
said
that
the
--
that
the
state
of
arkansas
said
that
these
people
should
not
be
allowed
to
dissuade
this
persons
from
going
in.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
but
let
me
just
say
this.
these
were
not
the
exact
result,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
real
question
is
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
the
real
question
is
scab
here
and
this
was
what
the
testimony
develops
and
this
is
what
the
court
to
say
in
its
opinion.
and
as
to
that,
what
the
strikers
were
doing
under
those
circumstances,
were
really
asking
these
persons
to
examine
the
moral
implications
of
their
break
from
the
group
activity
of
which
they
had
been
apart.
now,
it's
true
that
it's
a
vigorous
word
they
were
using,
a
most
vigorous
word.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
but
it
was
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
i'm
going
--
i'm
going
to
reserve
just
a
few
moments
of
the
--
my
time,
if
i
may?
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
and
merely
to
just
say
this
in
response
to
your
question
here.
that
the
fact
it
was
insistent,
the
fact
that
it
was
done
there
by
this
persons
standing
on
the
vacant
lot,
doesn't
in
my
mind
show
any
intimidation
or
coercion
here
but
this
wasn't
it,
this
was
a
truthful
appellation
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
if
they
find,
if
they
were
to
find
this
use
of
the
term
“scab”,
a
truthful
appellation
were
to
be
part
and
not
fall
within
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
then
(voice
overlap)
they
may
very
welcome
to
say
that
strike
breakers
to
be
barred
or
traitor
or
judas
or
all
of
the
galaxy
of
synonyms
here
for
what
these
persons
has
really
done
here
in
breaking
away
from
the
group
activity.
is
this
court
going
to
do
what
justice
cardozo,
at
one
point,
sitting
as
a
judge
in
new
york
court
of
appeals,
engaging
this
very
ludicrous
process
of
finding
which
--
which
of
these
truthful
appellations
the
strikers
may
or
may
not
use.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
and
may
i
--
well,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
--
if
i
may.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
the
court
please.
i'm
sure
there
is
inadvertent
on
mr.
shaver's
part
to
indicate
that
there
was
anything
--
for
example
the
mass
picketing
here.
there
is
no
such
finding
in
this
record
on
the
court
below,
none
whatsoever.
there
was
no
mass
picketing
here
of
any
kind.
people
walk
in
and
out
with
no
blockage
or
interference
or
interest
here.
now,
i
want
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
--
to
the
meadowmoor
point
that
seven
of
the
justices
raised
in
the
question
of
mr.
shaver
here.
i
think
that
it
was
explained
from
the
--
some
of
the
questions
were
put
that
there's
a
complete
understanding
as
to
what
meadowmoor
meant.
meadowmoor
meant
that
where
you
have
violence
in
such
frequency
in
depth
and
the
character
that
you
had
in
meadowmoor
is
there,
such
intensity
that
you
had
in
meadowmoor
that
if
you
have
a
course
of
trust
into
the
future
so
that
any
beholder
of
a
picket
line
knowing
of
the
past
would
look
upon
that
picket
line
as
--
as
a
arm
with
a
club,
so
to
speak,
or
arm
with
a
bomb
which
is
true
in
meadowmoor
then
under
those
circumstances
--
under
those
circumstances
you
can
prevent
--
prohibit
all
picketing
including
peaceful
picketing
because
there
is
no
such
thing.
it's
been
transmuted
into
something
quite
different
than
peaceful
picketing.
this
is
not
the
situation
here.
here,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
very
image
was
not
sufficient
to
deter
or
persuade
anyone
not
to
enter.
certainly,
the
after
image
if
there
is
an
after
image
here
of
the
speech.
this
is
what
you
have
to
find.
there
is
an
after
image
of
the
speech,
certainly
wasn't
sufficient.
now,
turning
for
a
moment
to
the
violence,
so-called
acts
of
violence
which
the
court
below
apparently
considered
to
be
violent.
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
these
several
incidents,
as
mr.
shaver
has
indicated,
two
of
them
took
place
during
the
earlier
proceeding
there
and
which
is
not
--
which
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
the
complaint
and
certainly
cannot
be
a
--
a
matter
concerning
which
a
--
a
court
can
utilize
the
support
for
an
injunction
this
was
a
matter
at
the
prior
proceeding
there.
now,
as
to
one
of
the
matters
there,
i
think,
mr.
shaver
press
inadvertently
didn't
elaborate
upon
and
that
was
the
so-called
threat.
it's
only
the
threat
in
the
record
to
personal
safety
of
any
of
these
--
any
person
and
that
i'm
sure
its
inadvertence
in
his
part
when
he
failed
to
mention
the
plant
manager,
that
he's
doing
the
threats
addressed
about
wiping
up
the
walk
with
the
sending
back
to
wisconsin.
that
was
made
by
a
woman
and
that
mr.
bonady,
the
plant
manager
said
in
the
record
personally,
“i
don't
think
she's
big
enough
to
do
it
unless
she's
going
to
have
an
awful
lot
of
help.”
this
doesn't
sound
to
me
--
this
doesn't
make
any
seriousness
or
take
it
with
any
degree
of
seriousness.
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
incident
concerning
which
justice
whittaker
asked
me,
that
is
the
snake,
i
think
it's
plain
the
from
the
testimony
that
--
that
mr.
shaver
himself
read
into
the
record
there,
at
great
length
that
there
is
no
connection
whatsoever.
none
whatsoever
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
doesn't
find
the
connection
between
the
snake
incident
and
strikers.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
if
can
turn
to
my
fellow
counsel
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
i
just
--
i
will
now
--
will
now
come
back
to
the
--
to
the
question
here
which
is
--
which
as
i
see
it
and
it
would
appear
from
the
question.
the
only
question
we
--
before
this
court
really
at
this
point
is
the
right
of
strikers
to
stand
on
their
property
by
the
way
and
the
court
makes
this
point
on
their
property
for
the
most
part.
there
are
some
indications
there
may
have
been
on
the
street
on
occasion
that
the
court
makes
no
real
point
of
that.
it
would
appear
that
to
the
most
part,
they
stood
on
their
property
on
strike
headquarters
and
call
the
strike
breakers
scab.
i
would
like
to
say
as
to
that,
particularly
relating
it
to
questions
of
mr.
justice
black
and
that
is
this.
that
this
is
the
precisely
the
kind
of
question
on
which
the
expertise
of
the
labor
board
must
be
brought
into.
this
is
the
kind
of
question
in
which
the
board
has
passed
several
times
now
and
has
been
referred
to
these
cases
in
our
brief
and
has
found
this
kind
of
activity
to
be
protected.
we're
not
only
talking
now
about
the
preemption
in
the
terms
of
garner.
we
were
talking
about
an
interference
with
protected
activity
under
section
7
and
section
13
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
submit
to
this
court
where
you
have
this
kind
of
a
question,
certainly,
it
should
in
the
first
instance
as
this
court
has
said
in
countless
preemption
cases
and
all.
there'd
be
some
16
since
garner
by
this
court
and
countless
of
those
cases,
this
court
has
said
in
the
first
instance
where
you
have
this
kind
of
a
question,
where
you
cannot
be
sure
as
to
whether
it
is
a
protected
activity
or
a
proscribed
activity
that
it
must
go
to
the
labor
board
in
the
first
instance.
and
i
say
to
you
that
if
it
is
a
proscribed
activity,
then
certainly
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated,
then
it
certainly
a
matter
for
the
labor
board
and
this
is
not
the
kind
of
situation
which
was
meant
in
the
kohler
case
which
came
up
here
under
the
name
of
uaw
against
wisconsin
employment
relations
board
at
the
last
term
or
the
term
preceding
the
last
term
and
that
is
this
is
not
the
kind
of
situation
where
you
have
violence.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
situation
where
you
have
overt
threat
or
violence.
it's
not
the
kind
of
situation
where
you
have
mass
picketing
where
you
have
this
kind
of
post
question,
i
say
it
must
in
the
first
instance
go
to
the
labor
board
to
determine
whether
it's
protected
or
whether
it's
proscribed.
and
let
me
just
make
the
final
observation,
had
it
gone
to
the
labor
board
how
different
--
how
different
the
circumstance
would
be
now.
had
it
gone
to
the
labor
board,
the
labor
board
would
have
done
probably
what
the
wisconsin
labor
relations
board
did
if
it
found
--
if
it
found
this
to
be
appropriate
activity.
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
limited
its
injunction.
if
you
recall
in
the
kohler
case,
when
it
came
before
this
court,
in
the
kohler
case,
the
wisconsin
labor
relations
board
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
dealing
with
threats,
despite
the
fact
they
were
dealing
with
mass
picketing,
despite
the
kind
of
rather
intensive
conduct
that
they
had
--
misconduct
that
they
had
there.
despite
all
of
that
there
is
a
limited
--
a
limited
cease
and
desist
order
that
--
that
issue
certainly
in
this
particular
proceeding,
i
am
certain
that
this
labor
board
would
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
of
a
limited
nature
applying
only
to
the
calling
of
the
term
scab
if
they
found
it
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
one
final
observation,
if
i
may,
and
that
is
that
this
labor
board
would
certainly
have
considered
the
fact
in
coming
to
the
question
that
whether
or
not
strikers,
standing
as
a
minority
here
in
this
small
community
in
arkansas
whether
or
not
strikers
have
the
right
to
utter
this
kind
of
thing,
they
would
have
considered
the
provocation
and
unfair
labor
practices
on
the
part
of
the
company.
this
is
what
this
court
had
reference
to
in
the
(inaudible)
case
when
they
made
this
point
so
very
carefully
there
that
there
is
something
quite
different
when
it
comes
before
the
labor
board
which
has
the
power
to
go
in
and
look
into
all
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
and
break
the
barrier
of
its
expertise
upon
the
entire
labor
relations
controversy
not
piecemeal.
i
say
that
the
board
would
have
under
those
circumstances
look
into
the
entire
controversy
and
into
the
unfair
labor
practices
which
were
i
believe
they
would
have
found
on
the
record
here.
mr.
william
j.
isaacson
there's
no
question
about
that.
some
denied
--
it's
submitted
in
the
brief
of
the
--
it's
submitted
in
the
brief
of
--
of
mr.
shaver
and
mr.
brennan
asked
a
question
of
--
of
counsel,
i
will

for
the
company,
i

we'll
refer
him
to
pages
45
and
46
of

record,

testimony
and
also
