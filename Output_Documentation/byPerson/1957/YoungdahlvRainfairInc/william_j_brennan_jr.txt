justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
isaacson,
may
you
tell
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
significance
of
assisting,
given
to
the
board
proceeding
on
the
preemption
point
or
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you're
using
that
in
support
of
the
preemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
--
does
this
settlement
agreement
for
close
both
employer
and
the
union
from
further
proceedings
before
the
board,
arising
out
of
this
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
from
that,
is
there
anything
in
the
settlement
agreement
which
perhaps
may
render
the
absent
quite
moot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
intervened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
union
(voice
overlap)
--
but
the
union
for
reasons
would
at
least,
if
it
went
a
long
voluntarily
on
a
settlement
as
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
you
were
or
we're
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i'm
puzzled
mr.
isaacson
about
this
settlement
agreement.
i
had
the
impression
when
you
first
mentioned
it
that
the
union
was
a
party
to
it.
now,
you
said
it's
only
between
the
board
and
the
--
the
--
director
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
union
have
--
didn't
the
union
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
has
to
consent
but
did
it
or
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
object?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
--
did
you
object
to
it
when
it
was
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
isaacson,
you're
going
into
some
of
the
details
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
evidence.
i'm
just
wondering,
what
are
we
suppose
to
do
with
the
findings.
i
gather
this
as
the
significant
one,
isn't
it?
paragraph
2
of
the
restraint
that
is
--
have
resorted
to
violence,
coercion
and
intimidation
and
such
other
unlawful
conduct
that
miscalculate
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
--
i
noticed
that
two
of
two
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
this,
“according
to
the
undisputed
evidence
here,
the
whole
pattern
of
conduct
along
the
picket
line
discloses
a
clear
design
on
the
part
of
the
appellants,
to
intimidate
and
coerce
their
former
fellow
workers
by
a
persistent
abuse,
insults,
and
conduct
calculated
the
cause,
breaches
of
the
peace
and
other
unlawful
results.”
are
you
asking
us
now
to
look
behind
the
--
those
strike
to
me
as
being
concurrent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
go
behind
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
isaacson,
on
your
view
of
this
record,
would
--
it
had
been
appropriate
for
the
trial
judge
to
have
allowed
picketing
but
conditioned
upon
the
discontinuance
of
this
kind
of
name-calling
an
epithet.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
speaking
of
that.
i'm
--
i'm
supposing
an
injunction
which
merely
enjoined
this
kind
of
name-calling,
an
epithet
but
permitted
picketing
to
continue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
injunction
is
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
injunction
of
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
forgetting
the
preemption
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
scab
and
no
matter
how
qualified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
often
they
tell
them
to
reiterate
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
shaver,
may
i
ask
you
another
--
your
supreme
court,
said
not
only
--
i'm
looking
at
page
202
of
the
record.
was
the
question
not
raised
below
but
then
follows
this.
in
the
appellants
expressed
the
unwillingness
to
await
the
action
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
their
charges
of
unfair
labor
practices
against
(inaudible).
before
proceeding
with
the
trial
of
the
instant
case,
what
does
that
concern
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wasn't
referring
to
that.
apparently,
in
the
court
below,
what
--
what
does
this
mean,
the
appellants
expressed
an
unwillingness
to
await
the
action
of
the
board,
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
their
charges
of
unfair
labor
practice
before
proceeding
with
the
trial
of
the
instant
case.
did
that
happened
in
the
trial
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
what
your
supreme
court
means
then
when
it.
this
indicates
that
there
must
--
the
issue
must
have
been
raised
somehow
in
the
trial
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
shaver,
did
i
understand
you,
as
i
understand
that
this
restraint
now
means
that
amalgamated
clothing
workers
of
america
at
least
and
the
individual
named
defendants
and
all
their
agents
and
employees
and
all
sympathizers
are
permanently
restrained
forever
from
ever
attempting
to
organize
this
plant
at
least
through
the
means
of
picketing
on
any
other
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
mean
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
said,
in
other
words,
they
have
to
get
relieved
from
the
obligation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
these
restraints
by
a
special
proceeding
where,
back
in
the
original
chancery
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
recall.
don't
repeat
them,
i
remember
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
shortly,
are
there
any
special
criteria
which
have
to
be
satisfied
in
order
to
get
relief
from
this
kind
of
restraint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now.
let's
say,
over
two
years
have
elapsed
now
since
this
was
issued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
time
limit
within
which
it
may
come
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
have
to
show
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
court
then
in
this
instance
probably
would
say,
we
will
allow
you
as
long
as
you
have
not
more
than
x
number
before
such
and
such
a
case
and
as
long
as
they
do
not
conduct
themselves
except
on
this
manner
or
except
as
they
carry
no
signs
except
signs
so
and
so
were
--
is
that
the
way
it
will
be
done?
