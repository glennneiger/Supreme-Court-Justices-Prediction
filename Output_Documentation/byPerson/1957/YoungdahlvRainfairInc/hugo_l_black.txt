as
i
understand,
are
you
objecting
now
to
the
entire
injunction
for
just
that
(inaudible)
of
injunction
that
applies
to
all
action
including
the
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we'll
recess
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
its
population?
justice
hugo
l.
black
pretty
good
size
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
where
there
was
actual
violence
perpetrated
by
the
picketing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
grant
the
injunctions
and
he
claimed
that
that
the
injunction
was
too
broad
and
they
claimed
that
proper
the
places
--
the
supreme
court
says,
the
proper
place
to
get
this
done
is
for
the
trial
court
to
show
that
you
will
peaceful
picket
and
the
--
the
owner
will
be
taken
care
of
at
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
actual
violence.
an
injunction
could
be
issued
to
refrain
even
peaceful
picketing.
you
say
that
the
same
things
should
apply
here
so
--
and
you
cite
that
the
violence
made
with
the
rattle
snake
--
not
a
rattle
snake,
i
guess?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
plain
black
snake.
justice
hugo
l.
black
exactly.
that
would
be
lawlessness
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
violence
also
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assumed,
mr.
shaver.
that
if
the
company
--
if
the
union
is
guilty
of
the
things
that
the
courts
found
them
guilty
of,
it
was
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
law
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
wasn't
talking
about
that.
if
--
if
they're
guilty
there
that
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice
isn't
it
under
the
--
they
have
done
this
intimidation
and
coercion
and
threatening
and
so
forth
there.
they
would
--
would
that
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
all
these
name
--
this
scabs
holding
and
all
that
what
you
call
this
none
(inaudible)
words
they
used
there.
those
would
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
circumstances
before
it
was
found,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know.
i'm
not
talking
about
preemption.
i'm
just
wondering
if
it's
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
maybe
you
might,
maybe
the
state
might
still
enjoin
or
do
you
argue
that
they
would
not
--
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
federal
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
mass
picketing
out
--
it
might
be
(inaudible)
but
usually
that
wouldn't
be
quite
figured
out
to
be
a
mass
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
quite
a
difference
however
in
the
locality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
it
was
a
street
one
but
18
feet
wide
and
everyday
they'd
come
across
there
in
the
street.
i'd
like
to
say
just
two
things,
you've
been
gracious
to
me
and
that
is
about
this
breach
of
peace.
now,
we've
got
an
arkansas
statute
down
there
that
is
narrowly
withdrawn
as
chaplinsky
and
it's
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
and
it
just
says
that
--
that
this
is
a
crime
in
arkansas.
it's
been
on
the
statute
long
time
called
peace
and
tranquility
law.
â€œif
any
person
shall
make
use
of
any
profane,
violent,
vulgar,
abusive
or
insulting
language
toward
or
about
any
other
person
in
his
presence
or
hearing,
which
language
in
common
acceptation
is
calculated
to
arouse
to
anger
the
person
about
or
to
whom
it
is
spoken
and
addressed,
or
to
cause
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
a
breach
of
peace.
now,
the
courts
have
--
gone
ahead
and
say,
that
this
statute
not
only
recognize
the
right
of
a
person
to
not
only
to
be
safe
but
to
feel
safe
and
as
the
case
cited
207
ark.
with
reference
to
insulting
a
girl,
wanting
to
pay
of
$10,
the
court
held
that
was
a
breach
of
the
peace.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
they
ever
been
enjoined
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
securing
its
people
to
the
crowd
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
the
first
case
of
injunction
for
that
kind
of
a
statute,
for
that
kind
of
conduct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
how
can
they
meet
at
their
headquarters,
under
your
injunction,
could
they
meet
in
the
headquarters
under
your
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
know
where
it
was.
i
just
noticed
that
they
--
they
were
enjoined
congregating
and
(voice

--
justice
hugo

loitering
or
congregating
at
their
headquarters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
is
it
limited
in
the
--
in
the
order?
i
didn't
find
it.
i
was
a
little
curious
for
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
says
on
a
property
used
as
the
union's
headquarters
and
you
say
that
the
evidence
show
that
the
headquarters
that
they
probably
use
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
this
lot,
is
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
believe
i
have
ever
seen
one
before
whether
they
were
enjoined
congregating
at
their
headquarters.
did
you
run
up
on
the
meaning
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
the
plant?
how
close
to
the
city
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
wonder
if
the
snakes
were
located
around
that
yard.
it
didn't
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
that
the
company
was
subject
to
the
act?
