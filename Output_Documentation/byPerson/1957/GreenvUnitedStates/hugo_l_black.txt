justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
new
statute
thread
on
the
subject
of
notice
or
knowledge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
thats
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
defendants
have
seen
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
other
question
because
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
the
statement
made,
made
it
correct,
statement
made
by
justice
(inaudible)
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
--
it
was
--
could
not
be
a
crime
to
conspire
or
to
plan
with
others
to
obstruct
toward
the
chief
justice
by
refusing
to
be
present
to
await
the
final
action
of
the
court,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
any
statutory
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
any
--
any
--
do
you
concede
that
it's
not
a
violation
of
any
statute
to
do
this
and
then
there's
no
statute
of
recovery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
leave
--
well
--
well,
yes.
we'll
first
leave
out
the
element
of
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice,
that
wouldn't
cover
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
looked
at
it.
i
--
i
said
i
haven't
looked
at
the
statute
so
i'm
just
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
it
specify
this
particular
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
other
statute
under
which
he
could
have
been
charged
with
violating
a
criminal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
was
a
conspiracy
between
them
to
do
that,
could
they
have
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that
on
that
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
ever
appear
after
the
first
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
did
this
petitioner
ever
appear?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
first
order,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
didn't
appear
after
the
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
common
law
contempt
to
which
you
refer
requires
a
knowing
disobedience
of
the
order
with
knowledge
that
the
order
was
out,
the
common
law
contempt
to
which
you've
just
referred.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
under
this
particular
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
knowledge
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
that
include
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
it's
an
order.
could
a
man
be
convicted
of
willful
violation
without
showing
that
he
knew
the
order
was
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
it
wrote
anything
in
1871?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
to
the
power
of
that
contempt
and
aren't
you
a
little
strong
in
saying
everybody
has
always
recognized
the
power
to
punish
the
criminal
contempt,
inherent
power
of
courts,
isn't
that
a
little
strong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
early?
and
then
some
statements
had
just
eased
itself
into
the
common
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
section
402
of
18
u.s.
code
defines
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
it
says
constituting
contempt,
constituting
crime.
do
you
think
that
provides
for
the
trial
of
a
man
for
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
section
402,
contempts
constituting
crimes,
any
person
is
so-called
willful
in
disobeying
any
local
order.
is
statutory
contempts
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
statute
or
the
--
which
called
the
court's
inherit
power
to
punish
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
defines
itself
as
a
crime,
doesn't
it?
what
i'm
getting
at
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it
constitutes
a
conduct
or
authority,
doesn't
it?
the
prosecution
of
a
crime
where
the
man
was
entitled
to
have
a
trial
in
accordance
to
the
crime,
the
trial
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned.
i
suppose.
i
didn't
suppose
there
were
a
dispute
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
criminal
contempt.
i'm
talking
about
a
crime,
where
the
statute
makes
a
crime
and
forbids
certain
conduct
that
it
ceased
to
be
a
crime
because
the
statute
refers
to
it
as
contempt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not
all
of
them
so
far
as
the
statutory
contempt
you
say.
i'm
not
talking
about
now
what's
called
the
inherent
power
of
the
court.
i'm
talking
about
when
congress
comes
along
and
says
certain
things
and
held
not
to
be
done
and
that
makes
it
a
crime
--
makes
it
an
offense
punishable,
can
that
be
any
less
a
crime
because
it's
defined
as
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
defines
what
it
is,
command
of
any
district
court,
provision
the
order
by
doing
anything
or
act
forbidden,
if
the
actual
thing
he's
done
of
such
characters
constitute
also
a
criminal
offense
under
any
statute
of
the
united
states
shall
be
prosecuted
in
such
contempt
and
so
forth.
what
i'm
getting
at
here
--
where
does
it
--
if
the
man
can
be
prosecuted
under
the
statutory
offense
or
a
contempt
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
can
he
also
be
prosecuted
under
the
other
statute
which
makes
that
same
conduct
a
crime
under
another
name.
congress
has
attempted
to
preserve
the
right
to
punish
twice
for
the
same
conduct
both
of
them
defining
what
i
would
call
crime.
what
do
you
think
about
that
face
of
the
statute?
do
you
think
you
could
be
prosecuted
both
by
statutory
contempt
under
401
and
if
it
was
an
assault
and
battery,
could
also
be
constituted
or
prosecuted
for
assault
and
battery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
draw
a
distinction
between
statutory
contempt
defined
by
congress
at
these
statutes
and
contempt
which
is
not
under
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
insofar
as
the
statements
the
court
has
made
from
time
to
time
that
it
is
not
a
crime
within
the
fifth
amendment.
suppose
this
punishment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
this
statute
had
been
five
years,
it
said
that
for
disobeying
an
order
of
the
court,
a
man
should
be
given
five
years,
is
it
your
judgment,
he
could
be
tried
without
a
jury
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
with
you
fully
in
the
statement
that
these
statutes
have
done
away
with
what
was
called
inherent
power
of
the
court
punishment
for
contempt,
and
with
that
i
agree.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
his
argument
that
the
fact
that
it
was
customary
when
this
court
affirmed
the
case
and
send
back
a
mandate
plus
the
fact
that
the
court
immediately
issued
an
order
which
was
received
by
the
lawyers,
plus
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
said
that
he
told
this
man
that
he
had
--
about
(inaudible)
notice
containing
a
copy
of
the
proposed
order.
and
if
they
want
to
meet
on
that
date,
a
certain
date,
what
do
you
say
to
his
argument
that
a
jury
would
have
a
right
to
find
from
that
evidence
reasonably
or
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
man
did
have
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
presumptions
now.
i'm
talking
about
--
he
takes
the
position
that
from
that
evidence,
they
could
draw
reasonable
inferences
so
that
they
could
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
knew
about
this
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
the
additional
fact
that
a
statement
was
made
when
he
left,
that
he's
trying
to
get
away.
when
he
came
back,
did
he
--
had
gotten
away,
had
been
a
fugitive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
coule
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
he
be
a
fugitive
without
some
kind
of
an
order
of
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he
--
supposed
it
been
shown
that
he
knowing
--
knew
that
his
bail
has
been
forfeited
and
that
he
knew
that
after
the
bail
was
forfeited
the
man
refused
to
come
in
and
(inaudible)
be
afugitive.
do
you
say
that
--
there's
no
evidence
in
which
you
inferred
that
he
knew
that
the
--
the
court
have
made
a
sufficient
order
to
impose
on
him
the
duty
of
coming
back.
