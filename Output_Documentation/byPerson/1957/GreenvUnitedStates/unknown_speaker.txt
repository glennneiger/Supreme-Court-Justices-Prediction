could
they
have
been
convicted
of
anything?

(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
acknowledge
--
then
you
take
the
position,
it's
not
necessary
for
you
to
prove
as
a
matter
of
mathematical
or
geometrical
demonstration
but
as
a
matter
of
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
that's
all
you
have
to
do.
unknown
speaker
could
you
do
that
in
any
criminal
offense
that's
new
--
that's
recognized
as
a
criminal
offense,
hold
a
man
guilty
on
the
matter
of
being
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
--
unknown
speaker
--
was
a
crucial
point
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
--
i
can't
understand
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
can
understand
that
if
you
have
circumstances
sufficient.
but
apart
from
circumstances,
you
say
sufficient,
do
you
know
of
any
instance
in
which
in
a
criminal
case,
a
man
charged
with
a
felony,
let
us
say,
he
can
be
found
guilty
on
lack
of
evidence
on
a
crucial
point
on
this
premise
that
he
is
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
with
that
knowledge.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
a
method
--
that
then
would
be
(voice

to
the
fact
--
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
sufficient
to
hold
it
as
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
you
say
as
a
matter
of
policy
but
is
there
any
policy
that's
stronger
in
the
law
so
far
as
crime
is
concerned,
the
question
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
your
other
--
your
other
point
to
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
can
it
be
--
can
it
be
invoked
unless
there
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
the
question
i
asked.
unknown
speaker
the
question
i'm
--
understand
is,
can
it
be
invoked
unless
there
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
a
crucial
fact
upon
which
guilt
or
innocence
depends?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
could
come
in
conflict
with
--
unknown

come
in
conflict
with
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states?
