william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
spritzer,
i
understood
you
to
say
did
i
not
that
the
order
handed
to
the
notice
of
june
29th
or
whatever
day
that
was
(inaudible)
is
in
the
typed
form
that
the
order
was
july
2
as
entered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
inclusive
even
to
the
date
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
inclusive
even
to
the
date,
the
date,
july
2,
1951
appeared
as
i
am
--
do
i
correctly
understand
as
it
was
the
text
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
spritzer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wondered,
did
i
correct
you
--
correctly
understand
you
to
argue
on
this
matter
of
knowledge
and
the
order
alternatively
that
from
the
facts
and
circumstances,
knowledge
of
the
order
is
to
be
implied
as
a
matter
of
law
or
that
from
the
facts
and
circumstances
justifiably
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
actual
knowledge
maybe
incurred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
doing
it
alternatively
and
not
arguing
--
or
standing
in
one
or
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
that
first
sanction,
as
i
understand
it,
might
well
have
been
applied
whether
or
not
there's
been
any
conviction
(inaudible)
an
absconder
after
in
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
may
well
be,
there
were
no
orders
such
as
the
outlined
in
here
which
is
the
matter
before
us
and
i
gather
that
your
position
is
that
the
breadth
of
this
statute
embraces
this
order
and
this
is
an
order
of
his
disobedience
for
that
order
for
which
a
criminal
contempt
prosecution
was
held
and
that
we're
not
really
concerned
with
the
limits
on
outlawry
at
common
law,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
it,
these
--
these
contempts
were
not
present
at
least
technically
by
--
because
these
men
absconded
so
much
as
because
they
disobeyed
the
order
to
report.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
spritzer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
going
to
ask,
if
this
case
that
arisen
or
this
action
that
these
petitioners
had
arisen
after
the
bail
jumping
statute,
do
i
correctly
read
the
bail
jumping
statute
as
authorizing
both
a
criminal
prosecution
under
that
statute
for
the
possible
sentence
to
five
years
to
$5000
enclosure
and
also
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
there
might
have
been
both
in
that
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
abt,
was
this
really
a
contempt
prosecution
for
absconding
or
is
it
rather
one
for
disobedience
of
this
order
of
july
