mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
for
review,
two
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirming
convictions
of
the
petitioners
for
criminal
contempt
of
an
order
of
the
district
court
that
was
entered
on
july
2nd,
1951.
the
order
in
question
requires
the
petitioners
to
surrender
to
the
united
states
marshal
in
consequence
of
the
affirmance
by
this
court
in
dennis
versus
the
united
states
of
their
convictions
for
conspiring
to
violate
the
smith
act.
each
petitioner
was
separately
tried
by
the
court
without
a
jury
and
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
in
a
penitentiary
for
a
term
of
three
years
consecutive
upon
his
five-year
sentence
in
dennis.
the
questions
along
the
two
cases
are
identical
and
there
has
no
material
difference
between
them
as
to
the
facts.
the
first
point
that
i
shall
argue
is
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
sustain
the
conviction.
each
contempt
proceeding
was
initiated
by
an
affidavit
of
the
united
states
attorney
and
the
issuance
of
an
order
to
show
cost
followed
by
the
filing
of
specifications
of
criminal
contempt.
these
documents
charge
that
the
petitioners
had
and
i
quote,
“willfully
and
knowingly
disobeyed
the
order
for
their
surrender
which
is
entered
on
july
2,
1951”
and
which,
and
again
i
quote,
“they
well
knew
to
the
outstanding.”
accordingly,
knowledge
by
the
petitioners
of
the
existence
of
the
order
was
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
and
one
which
the
government
was
required
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
government,
however,
introduced
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
petitioners
knew
that
the
order
for
their
surrender
had
been
issued.
the
government's
evidence,
petitioners
offered
none
established
appellant.
the
dennis'
defendants
were
convicted
and
sentenced
in
the
1949
after
which
they
were
enlarged
on
bail
and
pending
appeal.
this
court
affirmed
their
conviction
on
june
4th,
1951.
thereafter,
on
june
28th,
1951,
the
united
states
attorney
served
defense
counsel
with
a
notice
that
on
july
2nd,
he
would
make
application
to
district
judge
ryan
for
an
order
requiring
all
of
the
defendants
to
surrender
through
the
marshal
on
july
2nd.
the
next
day,
june
29th,
counsel
for
both
sides
appeared
before
judge
ryan
in
connection
with
certain
motion
that
the
defense
desired
to
make.
believing
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
case
because
the
mandate
of
this
court
had
not
yet
been
received
by
the
district
court,
judge
ryan
deferred
consideration
of
all
matters
until
july
2nd.
at
that
point,
one
of
the
defense
attorneys
gave
the
court
the
assurance
that
he
would
have
all
the
defendants
in
court
on
july
2nd.
later,
the
same
day,
that
is
after
the
appearance
before
judge
ryan.
two
of
the
defense
attorneys
saw
their
clients
including
the
petitioner
advised
them
of
their
presence
in
court
on
july
2nd.
it
was
required
and
were
assured
that
the
petitioners
would
be
present
on
that
day.
petitioners
and
two
of
the
other
dennis'
defendants
all
--
and
thompson,
did
not
appear
on
july
2nd.
at
which
time,
judge
ryan
declared
their
bail
forfeited
and
issued
bench
warrants
for
their
arrest.
he
also
signed
the
proposed
order
requiring
the
immediate
surrender
of
all
of
the
dennis'
defendants
including
the
four
fugitives.
now,
i
shall
point
out
in
greater
detail
later
that
as
the
government,
i
think,
concedes,
this
appears
to
be
the
only
instance
in
the
entire
history
of
anglo-american
law
of
the
entry
of
an
order
for
the
appearance
or
surrender
of
a
defendant
after
the
defendant
had
absconded.
in
any
event,
petitioners
were
not
seen
or
heard
from
again
until
the
time
of
their
voluntary
surrender,
green
on
february
27th
and
winston
on
march
5th,
1956.
each
petitioner
announced
his
intention
to
surrender
in
a
statement
that
he
mailed
to
the
press
the
day
before
his
appearance
in
the
court
house.
the
substance
of
this
statement
was
that
petitioners
had
fled
in
1951
as
a
means
of
resisting
what
they
believe
to
be
a
(inaudible)
in
this
country.
and
that
their
surrender
was
motivated
by
what
they
regarded
as
a
change
in
the
political
climate
which
made
this
form
of
resistance
unnecessary.
green
made
similar
statements
upon
interviews
by
the
press
at
his
appearance
--
at
the
time
of
his
appearance
at
the
court
house.
now,
these
statements,
of
course,
acknowledge
the
obvious
that
both
petitioners
had
pled
to
obey
the
imprisonment
and
so
much
counsel
conceded
at
the
trials.
however,
there's
nothing
in
their
statements
to
indicate
that
they
have
knowledge
of
the
issuance
of
a
surrender
order
of
july
2nd
and
under
that
order
which
they
were
charged
with
willfully
unknowingly
disobeying
well
knowing
and
without
standing.
i
have
now
recited
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
what
i've
said
is
not
only
my
version
to
the
fact,
but
the
fact
as
found
by
the
district
court.
his
appearance
from
his
written
opinion
on
the
green
case,
record
67,
a
relevant
paragraph
as
quoted
of
my
--
in
my
brief
at
page
12
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
it.
the
trial
court
found
that
this
evidence
which
i
have
now
summarized
was
sufficient
to
establish
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
petitioners
knowingly
disobeyed
the
order
for
their
surrender.
but
i
submit
that
the
evidence
offers
no
support
for
that
conclusion.
mr.
john
j.
abt
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess,
i
was
making
the
point
that
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
petitioners
had
knowingly
violated
the
order
for
their
surrender
was
without
support
in
the
evidence
as
i
recited
it
or
indeed
in
the
facts
as
found
by
the
trial
court
itself.
all
of
the
evidence
established
was
that
petitioners
knew
that
they
were
to
be
in
court
on
july
2nd.
knew
that
in
all
probability,
they
would
be
committed
on
that
day
and
that
they
fled
in
order
to
avoid
service
of
sentences
which
they
knew
were
in
store
for
them.
but
petitioners
were
not
charged
and
could
not
have
been
convicted
of
contempt
merely
because
a
jump-bail
and
were
fugitives
from
justice.
they
were
charged
with
and
convicted
of
knowing
disobedience
of
a
specific
order
for
their
surrender
which
they
well
knew
to
the
outstanding.
proof
that
they
had
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
that
order
was
therefore
required
and
there
was
no
such
proof.
apparently,
the
trial
judge
himself
recognized
the
vulnerable
--
vulnerability
of
this
finding
that
petitioners
have
knowledge
of
the
surrender
order.
for
he
made
the
further
finding
in
the
green
case
that
green
had
and
i
quote
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
record
page
67,
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
his
written
opinion
that's
--
the
written
opinion
on
the
green
case,
the
trial
court
made
the
further
finding
that
green
had
notice
of
the
order
and
willfully
disobeyed
it.
in
support
of
this
finding
that
is
that
green
have
notice
of
the
order,
the
court
cited
united
states
versus
hall,
a
second
circuit
decision
in
which
the
majority
of
the
court
sustained
the
contempt
conviction
of
another
absconding
dennis
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
abt
made
both
findings,
your
honor.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
a
finding
of
notice
that
the
judge
had
been
fully
satisfied
that
the
evidence
established
knowledge.
and
the
very
fact
that
he
went
on
to
find
notice
is
at
least
an
indication
that
he
had
some
doubt
as
--
as
to
the
validity
of
his
findings
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
as
to
the
the
notice?
record
67,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
--
in
which
case,
in
the
winston
case?
mr.
john
j.
abt
no.
there
was
--
there
was
no
written
opinion
on
the
winston
case.
and
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
in
his
oral
opinion
in
the
winston
case
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
the
judge
made
no
finding
as
to
notice
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
had
rested
entirely
on
knowledge.
however,
of
the
--
when
he
got
to
write
the
opinion
and
he
only
wrote
only
one,
he
made
the
finding
of
notice.
and
as
i
say,
in
support
of
that
finding,
he
cited
united
states
versus
hall
and
that
brings
me
necessarily
to
a
consideration
of
the
second
circuit
decision
in
that
case.
the
charge
against
hall
was
identical
with
that
on
which
the
petitioners
were
tried
and
the
evidence
was
substantially
the
same
as
in
the
present
cases
except
that
hall
was
apprehended
--
file
of
petitioners
here
voluntarily
surrendered.
now,
unlike
the
trial
judge
in
these
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
hall
case
did
not
find
that
hall
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
surrender
order.
instead,
it
sustained
the
conviction
on
a
theory
that
hall
was
chargeable
with
notice
of
the
order
because
it
found
from
the
evidence
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
an
application
for
the
order
would
be
made.
in
other
words,
it
held
that
knowledge
of
the
application
for
the
order
was
notice
of
the
order
itself
and
sufficient
to
hold
hall
in
that
case,
criminally
liable
for
disobedience
of
the
order
once
it
was
entered.
now,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
there
are
three
errors
in
this
theory
of
guilt
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
notice
theory.
in
the
first
place,
a
person
may
not
be
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
of
an
order
merely
on
proof
that
he
knew
that
the
order
would
be
applied
for
and
disobeyed
it
after
it
was
issued.
proof
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
is
required
to
sustain
a
conviction
for
criminal
contempt.
the
majority
involved
relied
in
a
dictum
in
pettibone
versus
the
united
states
cited
by
this
court,
148
united
states,
to
support
its
notice
theory.
i
quote
the
passage
from
hall
from
pettibone
at
page
15
of
my
brief,
it's
very
brief,
perhaps
i
should
take
a
moment
to
read
it
to
the
court.
in
pettibone,
the
court
said
and
as
i
say
the
statement
was
clearly
dictum.
"in
matters
of
contempt,
persons
are
not
held
liable
for
the
breach
of
a
restraining
order
or
injunction
unless
they
know
or
have
notice
or
a
chargeable
with
notice
--
with
knowledge
or
notice
that
the
writ
has
been
issued",
and
then
follows
the
important
phrase,
"or
the
order
entered
or
at
least
that
application
is
to
be
made."
i
think
it's
plain
that
the
court
did
not
intend
this
statement
to
apply
to
criminal
contempt.
for
the
three
authorities
which
it
cites
at
the
inclusion
of
the
statement
and
which
are
quoted
at
pages
17
and
18
of
my
brief,
all
hold
unequivocally
that
actual
notice
or
knowledge
of
the
making
of
an
order
is
a
prerequisite
to
conviction
for
criminal
contempt.
the
only
exception
and
it
isn't
a
true
exception
at
all
as
stated
by
daniell
in
his
chancery
pleading
and
practice
as
follows.
if
the
party
remains
in
court
until
the
order
is
about
to
be
made,
he
cannot
by
leaving
at
that
instant,
avoid
its
consequences.
now,
a
situation
that
daniell
described
was
of
course
not
the
situation
here.
the
petitioners
were
not
in
court
on
july
2nd
when
the
order
was
about
to
be
made
nor
did
they
leave
at
that
instance.
the
notice
theory
of
the
hall
case
is
not
only
contrary
to
the
authorities
cited
in
the
pettibone
case
but
as
wholly
unprecedented.
for
as
judge
biggs
stated
in
his
dissent,
the
doctrine
of
constructive
notice
and
that's
what
this
really
comes
down
to
as
i
see
it
and
as
judge
biggs
did,
has
never
before
been
substituted
for
proof
of
knowledge
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
or
in
any
other
criminal
case.
and
in
the
case
of
in
re
lennon
decided
by
this
court
in
166
united
states
and
cited
by
the
respondent
in
its
brief,
the
court
flatly
stated
that
proof
of
actual
notice
of
an
order
is
a
prerequisite
to
a
conviction
for
criminal
contempt
of
the
provisions
of
the
order.
moreover,
as
i
show
in
my
brief
and
as
judge
biggs
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
hall
case,
the
notice
there
is
not
only
contrary
to
authority
but
denies
the
accused,
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
violates
due
process.
the
second
error
in
the
notice
theory
of
guilt
is
that
the
charge
against
petitioners
was
not
that
they
had
notice
of
the
order
as
a
matter
of
law
but
that
they
had
actual
knowledge
of
its
existence.
having
been
tried
on
the
latter
charge,
their
convictions
cannot
be
sustained
on
an
entirely
different
theory
of
guilt.
and
finally,
the
notice
theory
is
untenable
because
while
petitioners,
as
it
appear
in
the
evidence,
were
told
to
appear
in
the
court
on
july
2nd.
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
were
informed
or
knew
that
application
for
a
surrender
order
would
be
made
on
that
day.
and
there
was
therefore,
no
proof
that
they
had
knowledge
of
the
application.
indeed,
as
appears
from
the
written
opinion
in
the
green
case,
again
in
the
record
67,
the
trial
judge
made
no
--
made
no
finding
that
the
petitioners
had
knowledge
that
an
application
for
the
surrender
order
would
be
made.
all
that
he
found
was
that
petitioners
were
told
to
be
in
court
on
july
2nd.
the
government
in
its
brief,
deliberately,
i
think
confuses
the
knowledge
and
notice
theories
of
guilt
and
argues
as
there
were
no
distinction
either
in
fact
or
in
law
between
them.
it
contends
that
the
evidence
shows
that
on
june
29,
1951,
petitioners
knew
that
the
entry
of
an
order
for
their
surrender
--
and
i
quote
from
the
government's
brief
was
both
"certain
and
imminent."
from
this,
the
government
argues
that
on
july
2nd,
petitioners
must
have
known,
and
again
i
quote
from
their
brief,
"that
the
order
they
had
every
reason
in
the
world
to
expect
had
in
fact
issued."
thus,
the
government's
contention
is
that
petitioners
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
issuance
of
the
order
of
july
2nd
because
prior
to
july
2nd,
they
knew
with
certainty
that
it
would
issue.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
argument
revolves
an
obvious
logical
uncertainty
for
it
is
impossible
to
prove
that
petitioners
knew
that
an
order
had
been
entered
on
the
basis
of
evidence
of
what
they
knew
or
did
before
it
wasn't.
moreover,
as
the
government
concedes,
the
dennis
fugitives
appeared
to
be
the
only
person
in
the
whole
course
of
our
law
against
whom
a
surrender
order
was
issued
after
they
had
absconded.
accordingly,
nothing
had
occurred
prior
to
july
2nd
could
possibly
have
conveyed
to
them
the
knowledge
that
on
that
day,
the
court
would
invoke
a
unique
procedure
which
no
judge
or
prosecutor
had
ever
in
the
history
of
our
law
thought
of
before.
to
use
the
government's
phrase,
they
had
every
reason
in
the
world
to
expect
that
they'd
be
treated
like
all
other
absconders.
that
is
to
say
that
their
bail
would
be
forfeited
and
a
bench
warrant
issued
for
their
arrest
and
that's
all.
now,
obviously,
if
that's
all
that
had
occurred,
they
could
not
have
been
convicted
of
contempt.
mr.
john
j.
abt
they
couldn't
been
convicted
of
anything,
your
honor.
as
of
that
time
--
as
of
today,
they
could
have
been
convicted
under
18
united
states
code
3146
adopted
or
passed
by
congress
in
1954
which
makes
a
bail
jumping
a
crime.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
3146,
your
honor.
more
than
that,
it
follows
from
the
government's
own
logic
that
the
petitioners
must
have
known
of
the
existence
of
the
order
upon
its
issuance
on
july
2nd.
yet
the
government
makes
no
such
claim.
it
says
only
that
petitioners
must
have
learned
of
the
order
and
i
quote
from
their
brief
at
page
24,
"at
some
point
during
the
long
period
when
they
were
in
hiding."
but
the
solicitor
general
cites
no
evidence
and
there
is
none
as
to
when
or
how
petitioners
acquired
this
information.
it
is
reduced
to
suggesting
that
petitioners
must
have
read
newspaper
reports
of
the
entry
of
the
order
and
that
the
court
should
take
judicial
notice
that
they
did
so.
that's
the
best
that
the
government
can
order
--
offer
in
the
satisfaction
of
its
burden
of
proof
of
knowledge.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
your
honor.
it
provides
simply
that
anyone
who
--
a
defendant
who
is
obliged
on
bail
and
who
jumps
bail
is
criminally
liable.
makes
--
makes
simply
makes
bail
jumping
as
such
a
crime
irrespective
of
the
issuance
of
any
order
for
declaratory
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
knowledge
as
in
the
statute,
anyone
who
knowingly
fails
to
appear
on
his
appearance
(inaudible)
on
bail.
all
that
is
stated,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
petitioners,
two
communist
committed
an
obstruction
of
justice
so
flagrant
that
they
are
to
be
punished
without
regard
for
the
presumption
of
the
innocence
or
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
the
guarantees
of
due
process.
now,
certainly,
petitioners
conduct
was
reprehensible
but
the
violation
of
fundamental
procedural
rights
on
which
their
contempt
--
convictions
were
based
does
not
indicate
the
majesty
of
the
law
but
defiles
it,
i
submit.
my
second
point
is
that
disobedience
of
an
order
for
the
appearance
or
surrender
of
a
defendant
enlarged
on
bail
is
not
punishable
as
a
contempt.
exhibit
a
in
support
of
this
proposition
is
the
fact
that
the
four
dennis
fugitives
are
the
first
and
to
date
the
only
absconders
in
the
entire
history
of
anglo-american
law
who
have
been
prosecuted
for
contempt
of
an
order
for
their
appearance
or
surrender.
in
all
other
cases,
absent
a
statute
making
bail
jumping
a
crime,
the
practice
in
this
country
has
been
simply
to
forfeit
the
defendant's
bail
and
issue
a
bench
warrant
for
his
arrest.
as
i
shall
attempt
to
show
the
use
of
the
contempt
power
to
punish
the
petitioners
and
the
other
dennis
absconders
is
not
only
unprecedented
but
it
is
also
unauthorized.
first,
as
this
court
has
held
and
as
the
government
acknowledges,
the
contempt
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
under
section
17
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
was
utmost
coextensive
with
the
contempt
jurisdiction
that
existed
as
common
law.
but
the
common
law
did
not
punish
absconding
as
a
contempt.
instead,
it
employed
a
process
of
outlawry
which
became
final
only
upon
the
failure
of
the
fugitive
to
appear
after
his
presence
had
been
demanded
in
five
successive
county
courts.
if
he
surrendered
before
the
fifth
demand
for
his
appearance,
he
was
not
held
in
contempt
for
disobedience
of
the
prior
demands
but
suffered
no
punishment
whatsoever.
since
absconding
in
violation
of
an
order
for
the
appearance
or
surrender
of
a
defendant
was
not
a
contempt
to
common
law,
it
was
not
punishable
as
such
under
section
7
of
the
judiciary
act,
the
first
judiciary
act.
i
demonstrate
in
my
brief,
pages
23
and
24.
i
can't
repeat
the
demonstration
here
that
neither
the
act
of
march
2nd,
1831,
nor
section
401
of
title
18
under
which
the
petitioners
here
were
prosecuted,
enlarged
the
categories
of
orders
for
disobedience
of
which
the
contempt
power
was
available
under
the
first
judiciary
act.
accordingly,
disobedience
of
a
surrender
order,
if
it
couldn't
have
been
punished
as
a
contempt
under
the
first
judiciary
act,
is
not
punishable
under
section
401.
the
government
argues
that
since
disobedience
of
a
subpoena
is
punishable
as
a
contempt,
the
same
remedy
should
be
available
for
disobedience
of
an
order
for
appearance
for
surrender.
thus,
the
two
orders
--
the
two
kinds
of
main
process
are
very
much
alike.
but
there
are
two
crucial
differences
between
the
two.
in
the
first
place,
disobedience
of
a
subpoena
was
always
punished
as
a
contempt
of
common
law,
the
file
as
i
have
shown,
disobedience
of
his
surrender
order
was
not.
in
the
second
place,
contempt
is
the
only
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
subpoena
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
of
course,
making
it
a
crime.
while
there
has
always
been
other
means
of
indicating
the
authority
of
the
court
against
absconders,
that
is
to
say
the
process
outlawry
until
the
government's
disuse
and
today
a
forfeiture
of
bail
and
arrest.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
simply
the
absence
of
cases,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
never
--
no
reported
case
of
such
of
a
prosecution.
there
are
two
state
cases
cited
in
my
brief
in
which
a
contempt
proceeding
was
instituted
against
a
defendant
who
failed
to
appear
but
of
course
no
order
for
the
appearance
had
been
made.
the
court
--
courts
in
both
those
state
cases
held
that
--
obviously
there
was
no
contempt
because
there
--
there
was
no
order
if
--
no
disobedience
to
any
order.
but
there
never
has
been
a
case,
your
honor,
reported
case
anywhere
in
england
or
in
this
country,
of
a
prosecution
of
this
character.
and
since
as
i
say
other
remedies
have
been
available
or
violations
for
bail
jumping
or
for
violation
of
an
order
for
appearance
or
surrender,
there
is
no
foundation
and
necessity
for
the
unprecedented
use
of
the
contempt
power
against
the
dennis
fugitives.
finally,
this
judicial
innovation
and
it's
surely
was
that
has
been
employed,
i
think,
in
a
discriminatory
and
indicative
manner
which
should
condemn
it.
for
it
was
invoked
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
at
the
height
of
the
anti-communist
hysteria
against
four
communists
as
a
device
for
keeping
additional
punishment
upon
them
over
and
above
their
sentences
for
a
political
crime.
the
third
and
the
final
point
that
i
shall
argue
is
that
the
trial
court
was
without
power
to
sentence
petitioners
to
prison
terms
in
excess
of
one
year.
the
point
presents
a
question
which
this
court
has
never
had
occasioned
to
consider,
that
is,
do
the
federal
courts
have
unlimited
power
to
punish
criminal
contempts
by
penitentiary
sentences
or
any
term
whatsoever
including
99
years
or
life
time?
petitioners
believe
that
this
question
must
be
answered
in
the
negative.
it
is
our
position
that
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
punish
criminal
contempts
is
restricted
to
the
imposition
of
sentence
as
in
the
case
of
offenses
which
are
not
infamous.
now,
since
1885,
an
infamous
offense,
as
been
defined
by
this
court
as
one
which
may
be
punished
by
confinement
in
a
penitentiary.
that
was
first
held
in
mackin
versus
united
states.
section
4083
of
title
18,
authorizes
confinement
in
a
penitentiary
where
the
term
is
for
more
than
one
year.
it
follows
that
all
of
offenses
that
may
be
punished
by
imprisonment
or
a
term
of
more
than
a
year
are
infamous.
hence,
if
contempt
is
not
an
infamous
offense,
it
may
not
be
punished
by
a
sentence
in
excess
of
a
year.
to
put
my
position
in
other
words,
it
is
that
a
criminal
contempt
as
misdemeanor
and
not
a
felony
as
these
two
terms
are
defined
in
section
1
of
title
18.
the
conclusion
that
criminal
contempt
is
not
subject
to
infamous
punishment
is
required,
i
believe,
by
section
401
of
title
18.
by
section
24
of
the
clayton
act,
now
section
402
of
title
18
and
by
rule
7
(a)
of
the
criminal
rules.
moreover,
a
contrary
conclusion
should
be
avoided
that
that
is
possible
and
i
think
it
is,
because
such
a
conclusion
would
violate
the
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
infamous
crimes
must
be
prosecuted
by
indictment.
i
first
consider
section
401.
that
section
in
language
derived
from
the
section
17
of
the
first
judiciary
act,
authorizes
a
court
to
punish
contempts
by
fine
or
imprisonment
at
its
discretion.
now,
the
government,
like
the
court
below,
argues
that
the
phrase
"at
its
discretion"
answers
the
question
how
long
a
term
of
imprisonment
which
is
normally
answered
to
--
in
a
criminal
statute
by
a
specific
number
of
years
and
answers
that
question,
how
long
a
term
of
imprisonment
by
leaving
the
length
of
a
sentence
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
however,
the
relevant
question
to
which
an
answer
must
be
sought
from
section
401
is
not
as
to
the
length
of
the
sentence
but
as
to
its
character,
that
is
to
say
whether
or
not
the
section
authorizes
infamous
punishment.
now,
when
the
reference
to
discretion
was
written
into
section
17
of
the
first
judiciary
act
in
1789,
there
was
no
statute
on
the
books
like
section
4083
of
title
18
which
determined
the
character
of
a
sentence
by
reference
to
its
language.
indeed,
the
first
judiciary
act
antedated
by
almost
a
century,
the
emergence
of
the
concept
that
confinement
in
a
penitentiary
constitutes
infamous
punishment
while
a
confinement
in
a
common
jail
does
not.
in
1789,
it
was
not
the
place
or
the
term
of
the
confinement
but
such
super
added
incidence
of
the
imprisonment
as
hard
labor
or
the
pillory
which
determined
the
infamous
character
of
the
sentence
--
of
the
punishment
rather.
since
none
of
this
incidence
was
authorized
by
the
act
of
1789,
that
act
did
not
authorize
infamous
punishment
for
contempt
as
infamous
punishment
was
conceived
of
at
that
time.
hence,
in
historical
context,
the
phrase
imprisonment
at
its
discretion
that
now
appears
in
section
401,
does
not
authorize
infamous
punishment
for
contempt
even
if
it's
to
be
said
to
give
the
court
discretion
over
the
length
of
the
sentence.
the
very
best
i
think
that
can
be
said
of
the
punishment
provisions
of
section
401
is
that
they're
ambiguous.
that
would
be
true
under
the
rule
of
strict
constructions,
the
punishment
may
not
be
infamous.
my
brief
cites
a
long
line
of
state
court
decisions
to
that
effect
including
one
that
arose
under
a
contempt
statute,
an
oklahoma
statute
substantially
identical
with
section
401
which
it
was
held
that
the
statute
for
the
reasons
i've
indicated
didn't
authorize
infamous
punishment.
furthermore,
the
fact
is
that
the
limitation
on
the
power
to
punish
which
as
i've
tried
to
show
was
inherent
in
section
401
and
its
predecessors
was
adhered
to
in
practice
from
1789
until
1916.
during
that
entire
period,
there
was
not
a
single
reported
incidence
of
infamous
punishment
for
contempt
in
either
the
federal
or
the
state
courts.
this
century
in
the
quarter
of
undeviating
practice
even
if
it
is
not
required
by
section
17
of
the
act
of
1789
and
its
successors,
was
frozen
into
law
by
section
24
of
the
clayton
act
of
1914
to
which
i
now
turn.
sections
21
and
22
of
the
clayton
act,
they're
set
forth
at
pages
84
and
85
of
the
respondent's
brief,
required
jury
trials
and
limit
imprisonment
to
a
maximum
of
six
months
for
contemptuous
conduct
and
disobedience
of
a
court
order
provided
that
such
conduct
also
constitutes
a
crime
under
federal
or
state
law.
that's
section
21
and
section
22.
section
24
of
the
same
act,
accomplishes
two
purposes.
first,
it
provides
at
the
jury
trial
and
maximum
punishment
provisions
of
section
22
shall
not
apply
to
contempts
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
or
so
near
as
to
obstruct
justice
or
to
contempts
like
those
about
here
of
orders
entered
in
suits
brought
by
the
united
states.
that's
the
first
thing
that
section
24
does.
but
section
24
does
something
else.
it
further
provides
that
contempts
of
the
kinds
that
i
have
just
described
and
i
quote,
"may
be
punished
in
conformity
to
the
usages
and
equity
and
law
now
prevailing".
the
legislative
history
contains
no
discussion
of
the
second
clause
which
i
call
the
prevailing
usage
clause
of
section
24.
but
it
finally
provides
that
contempts
of
the
kinds
described
in
section
24,
shall
be
punished
in
accordance
with
the
usage
that
prevailed
in
1914
when
the
clayton
act
was
passed.
as
i
have
shown,
the
usage
that
prevailed
without
exception
from
1789
until
1916,
two
years
after
the
clayton
act,
was
to
punish
contempt
as
an
offense
not
infamous.
hence,
even
were
the
court
to
hold
that
this
limitation
on
the
power
to
punish
is
not
inherent
in
section
401
and
its
predecessors,
it
was
given
the
force
of
law
by
the
prevailing
usage
clause
of
the
clayton
act.

john

that
i

one
exception
to
your
statement,
mr.

frankfurter.
i
don't
--
i
don't
put
it
negatively.
grammar
requires
me
to
phrase
it
in
a
negative
fashion
because
there
are
no
positive
words
to
say
it.
my
point
is
that
the
prevailing
usage
--
usage
to
prevail
without
exception
from
1789
to
1916
was
to
punish
offenses
--
punish
contempt
as
an
offense
not
infamous.
now,
i

that

an
infamous
offense
in
1789,
by
1885
as
been
said
by
this
court
to
be
an
infamous
offense.
in
other
words,
let
--
let
me
restate
my
point.
in
1789,
it
wasn't
the
place
of
confinement
that
determine
whether
punishment
was
infamous
or
not.
it
was
abuse
of
the
pillory
or
--
or
hard
labor.

j.
abt
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
follow,
your
honor,
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
sir.
but
infamous
crime
or
infamous
punishment
is
a
notion
of
a
punishment
which
involves
some
kind
of
disgrace.

yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
it
is
not
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
abt
let
me
restate
them.
let
us
assume
that
contempt
is
not
a
crime
within
the
fifth
amendment.
nevertheless,
if
the
--
if
the
usage
had
been
as
it
was
for
125
years
to
punish
contempt
as
though
it
were
a
crime
not
infamous
and
if
as
i
have
shown,
in
1914,
the
clayton
act
placed
the
limitation
on
the
punishment
for
contempt.
that
limitation
being
the
usage
which
previously
prevailed,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
irrespective
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
the
section
24
of
the
clayton
act
limits
the
punishment
of
contempt
to
punishment
for
--
on
infamous.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
--
that's
my
whole
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
to
be
a
foggy
issue?
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
--
i
have
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
that
--
and
my
point
is
i
--
i
think
this
court
did
never
reached
the
constitutional
question
because
under
a
proper
construction
of
401
and
402
as
--
that's
the
usage
clause,
that
the
court
is
without
power
to
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
substance
of
section
24
of
the
clayton
act
was
incorporated
in
section
402
of
title
18
when
the
criminal
statutes
were
revised
and
codified
in
1948.
the
codification
modified
some
of
the
wording
of
section
24,
but
as
my
brief
shows
and
as
the
government
does
not
deny,
the
codification
did
not
alter
the
substance
of
the
original
enactment
and
these
are
adviser's
notes
to
section
402
which
were
made
a
part
of
the
house
and
senate
committee
reports
specifically
state
that
the
changes
in
phraseology
did
not
change
the
meaning
or
substance
of
section
24.
accordingly,
section
402
like
its
predecessor
codifies
the
usage
which
prevailed
in
1914,
prohibits
infamous
punishment
for
contempt
and
by
virtue
of
section
4083
of
title
18,
limits
the
maximum
sentence
for
contempt
for
one
year.
the
government
makes
two
replies
to
this
contention.
first,
it
says
that
if
section
24
of
the
clayton
act
had
been
intended
to
set
a
maximum
prison
term
for
the
contempts
excluded
from
section
22,
congress
would
have
done
so
by
expressly
limiting
the
sentence
to
one
year.
in
effect,
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
because
the
prevailing
usage
clause
employs
what
he
characterizes
as
certain
elocutionary
language,
the
clause
should
be
disregarded
altogether.
or
he
insist
that
the
sole
purpose
of
section
24
was
to
confine
the
jury
trial
and
six
months
sentence
provisions
of
section
22
for
the
type
of
contempt
described
in
section
21.
as
i
have
shown,
however,
that
purpose
was
accomplished
by
these
explicit
provisions
of
the
first
clause
of
section
24.
hence,
the
respondent's
reading
of
section
24
makes
the
prevailing
usage
clause
completely
redundant.
second,
the
government
cites
a
number
of
federal
cases
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
clayton
act
in
which
contempt
sentences
of
more
than
one
year
were
imposed.
before
coming
to
these
cases,
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
state
law
on
the
question.
there
have
been
only
three
reported
instances
of
infamous
punishment
for
contempt
in
the
state
courts
and
in
all
three
of
these
cases
the
sentences
were
reversed
as
beyond
the
power
of
the
court
to
impose.
currently,
the
punishment
for
contempt
is
regulated
by
statute
in
36
states.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
we're
not
on
the
statutory
ground,
your
honor.
that
is
some
of
the
particular
statutory
grounds
i
discussed.
in
one
of
the
cases
it
was
reversed
on
constitutional
ground,
the
grounds
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
discussing
a
moment
ago.
and
the
other
two,
the
reversal
was
on
the
ground
that
unless
the
statute
specifically
and
expressly
provides
for
infamous
punishment,
infamous
punishment
may
not
be
imposed.
in
furtherance,
i
say
the
punishment
for
contempt
is
regulated
by
statute
in
36
states.
i
summarized
the
statutes
at
page
45
of
my
brief.
none
of
them
authorizes
infamous
punishment.
nineteen
states
fixed
the
maximum
term
at
30
days
or
less
and
of
the
29
states
which
specify
the
length
of
the
sentence,
only
two
authorize
imprisonment
for
a
period
as
long
as
one
year.
i
turn
now
to
the
federal
authority.
since
1914,
the
date
of
the
clayton
act,
there
had
been
nine
reported
cases
in
which
infamous
punishment,
that
is
sentence
of
more
than
one
year,
has
been
affirmed.
with
one
exception,
however,
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
impose
infamous
punishment
was
not
raised
or
considered
in
any
of
these
cases.
the
exception
is
creekmore
versus
united
states
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
1916,
two
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
clayton
act.
the
decision,
however,
does
not
mention
the
prevailing
usage
clause
which
evidently
had
not
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
this
court
has
affirmed
a
criminal
contempt
sentence
of
more
than
one
year
in
only
case,
hill
versus
united
states
decided
in
1937.
all
that
that
case
decided,
however,
was
at
the
maximum
sentence
of
six
months
specified
in
section
22
of
the
clayton
act
is
inapplicable
to
contempt
for
disobedience
of
an
order
entered
in
an
action
brought
by
the
united
states.
thus,
the
court
in
this
case
is
free
to
write
on
a
clean
slate.
now,
i
don't
suppose
that
there
can
ever
be
a
dogmatic
answer
to
any
novel
question
of
law.
and
this
is
certainly,
particularly
true
when
the
question
lies
in
the
difficult
area
of
statutory
construction.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
necessary
to
establish
that
mine
is
the
only
possible
interpretation
of
the
contempt
statutes
which
i
have
discussed
and
of
rule
7
(a)
of
the
criminal
rules
which
i
discussed
in
my
brief
(inaudible)
further
here.
it
is
enough
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
the
interpretation
for
which
i
contend
is
tenable.
if
so,
i
submit
it
should
be
adopted
for
a
contrary
conclusion
would
pose
a
major
constitutional
question
which
as
this
court
has
so
often
held
should
be
avoided
if
possible.
the
question
is
one
which
the
court
has
never
had
occasion
to
decide.
it
arises
from
the
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
infamous
crime,
that
is
crimes
that
are
punishable
by
infamous
punishment
must
be
prosecuted
by
indictment.
the
government
contends
that
the
question
is
insubstantial
because
criminal
contempt
is
sui
generis
and
hence
is
not
a
crime
within
the
meaning
of
the
amendment.
but
i
think
that
the
question
cannot
be
so
lightly
dismissed.
as
mr.
justice
holmes
said
of
criminal
contempts
in
the
first
(inaudible)
case
and
i
quote
him.
"if
such
acts
are
not
criminal,
we
are
in
error
as
to
the
most
fundamental
characteristic
of
crimes
as
that
word
has
been
understood
in
english
speech".
accordingly,
many
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
for
the
protection
of
those
accused
of
crime
had
been
held
applicable
to
prosecutions
for
criminal
contempt
including
such
the
other
guarantees
of
the
fifth
amendment
against
double
jeopardy
and
compelled
testimony
against
one's
self.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
mr.
justice
holmes
did
not.
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
the
fact
is
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
statute
of
limitations,
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
the
fact
is
that
this
court
has
held
for
example
that
the
double
jeopardy
and
provision
and
the
guarantee
against
compelled
testimony
of
the
fifth
amendment
are
applicable
to
criminal
contempt.
the
exception
is
the
holding
that
criminal
contempt
sui
generis
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
requirement
of
a
jury
trial
in
criminal
cases.
as
i
show
in
my
briefs,
this
exception
appears
to
rest
on
an
erroneous
reading
of
history.
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
was
the
case.
certainly,
a
substantial
constitutional
question
as
presented
by
the
decision
below
and
the
contention
of
the
government
which
would
compound
this
error
of
history
by
a
ruling
that
criminal
contempt
is
not
a
crime
within
the
indictment
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
construction
of
the
contempt
statutes
and
of
rule
7
(a)
of
the
criminal
rules
for
which
i
contend
avoids
the
constitutional
question.
it
equates
the
power
of
federal
judges
to
punish
criminal
contempt
with
the
power
that
they
exercise
during
the
first
century
and
a
quarter
of
our
history
and
which
still
prevails
in
every
state
and
it
implements
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
sound
democratic
principle
that
no
court
should
be
called
with
limitless
power
over
the
extent
and
character
of
the
punishment
that
it
may
impose.
to
conclude,
as
i
have
shown,
the
cases
of
petitioners
and
the
other
two
dennis'
fugitives
are
wholly
without
precedent
in
three
respects.
first,
in
the
use
of
the
contempt
power
as
a
device
for
punishing
absconders.
second,
the
theory
of
the
evidence
on
which
their
convictions
were
faced
and
third
in
the
severity
of
their
sentences.
in
each
of
these
respects,
the
convictions
and
sentences
are
not
only
unprecedented
but
are
unauthorized
by
law
and
impinged
on
constitutionally
protected
rights.
a
reversal,
i
submit,
is
therefore
required.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'll
attempt
to
conclude
in
four
minutes,
you
honor
so
that
i
won't
(inaudible)
court.
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh,
i
understand.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
normal
first
reaction
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
take
it
that
that
was
the
reaction
of
this
court
is
that
the
man
who
absconds
after
his
conviction
and
certainly
after
his
conviction
has
been
affirmed
by
this
court
is
guilty
of
some
kind
of
an
offense
for
which
he
ought
to
be
punished.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
if
the
court
please,
that
except
where
a
statute
makes
bail
jumping
a
crime,
neither
the
government
nor
i
have
been
able
to
find
any
case
in
which
an
absconder
has
suffered
any
punishment
other
than
the
forfeiture
of
his
bail
and
the
issuance
of
a
bench
warrant
for
his
arrest,
if
that
be
called
punishment.
that
--
that
just
happens
to
be
the
state
of
the
law
and
has
been
since
the
beginning
in
the
case
of
his
character.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
coming
--
i'm
coming
to
that
next,
your
honor.
but
what
i
said
applies
to
any
kind
of
absconding
whether
there
---
there
has
never
been
a
case
before
as
i've
said
earlier
in
which
an
order
to
surrender
was
entered
against
the
defendant
after
he
have
absconded,
just
never
heard
anybody
before.
now,
certainly
if
no
order
had
been
entered
in
this
case,
no
surrender
order
had
ever
been
entered
in
this
case,
there
couldn't
have
been
a
contempt
prosecution.
and
similarly,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
defendant
didn't
know
that
a
contempt
order
was
entered,
he
can't
be
held
in
contempt
any
more
than
he
could
have
been
of
no
order
at
the
moment.
now,
the
only
evidence
that
the
government
has
been
able
to
--
even
to
suggest
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
order,
is
contained
in
the
statements
that
the
defendants
issued
immediately
prior
to
their
surrender,
which
as
the
government
says,
indicated
that
they
knew
they
were
fugitives.
well
of
course,
they
knew
they
were
fugitives,
nobody
could
deny
that.
the
government
says,
since
they
knew
that
they
were
fugitives,
they
must
have
known
that
the
order
for
their
surrender
had
been
entered.
but
the
government's
conclusion
doesn't
follow
from
its
premise.
if
the
court
had
done
what
every
--
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
discover,
every
court
has
done
in
the
past
really
forfeited
the
defendant's
bail.
when
his
bail
was
forfeited
and
he
became
fugitive.
and
all
--
when
--
when
the
statements
--
and
i
agree
with
mr.
spritzer,
the
statements
indicate
that
the
man
knew
they
were
fugitive.
but
it
doesn't
indicate
that
they
knew
that
they
were
fugitives
by
virtue
of
the
entry
of
the
surrender
order.
they
could
just
as
well
have
been
fugitives
by
virtue
of
the
forfeiture
of
their
bail.
and
as
i
say,
that's
--
that's
the
only
bit
of
evidence
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
government
concedes
on
as
evidence
of
knowledge.
everything
else
that
it
says
is
not
on
the
basis
of
actual
knowledge
of
a
surrender
order
but
on
the
theory
that
mr.
spritzer
stated
very
correctly,
that
the
defendants
are
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
with
knowledge
of
the
order
that
is
if
they
have
notice,
some
kind
of
constructive
or
implied
notice
of
the
order.
and
what
mr.
spritzer
said
i
think
in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
black
is
that
justice
black
said,
"will,
the
law
--
as
i
understood
you,
sir,
you
said,
"will
the
law
imply
knowledge
in
a
criminal
case?"
and
mr.
spritzer
answered,
"yes,
the
law
will
imply
knowledge
when
not
to
do
so
would
permit
a
defendant
to
flout
the
law."
well,
that's
to
me
like
saying
that
because
you
think
a
man
is
guilty
and
ought
to
be
punished,
you
punish
him
even
though
we've
got
no
evidence
that
he
is
guilty
and
you
can't
prove
he's
guilty
under
reasonable
doubt.
that's
what
it
comes
down
to.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
think
toth,
if
you
cite
it,
your
honor
is
applicable
there.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
comes
down
to
a
presumption,
your
honor.
i
serve
you
with
a
--
with
a
notice
that
tomorrow
i'm
going
to
apply
for
an
order.
lots
of
things
happened
between
a
notice
of
an
order
and
the
issuance
of
the
order.
the
order
of
reapplication
can
be
withdrawn.
the
court
can
deny
the
order.
it
can
enter
as
a
modified
form,
something
that
can
happen
--
can
happen
will
render
the
application
moot
before
it's
ever
made
so
that
there
can
be
no
presumption
or
inference
that
an
order
has
been
entered
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
an
order
has
been
applied
for.
now,
it's
true
that
there's
an
inference
i
suppose,
the
man
will
be
charged
with
knowledge
that
he
knew
that
it
was
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
that
the
sun
was
up.
but
orders
don't
follow
from
applications
like
the
sunrise
from
the
revolution
of
the
earth.
mr.
john
j.
abt
been
a
fugitive.
mr.
john
j.
abt
all
that
means,
your
honor
at
most
--
of
course
he
knew
he
was
a
fugitive.
he
knew
he
was
supposed
to
go
to
jail.
and
let
--
i
suppose
he
knew
that
if
he
didn't
show
up,
his
bail
would
be
forfeited.
and
therefore,
he
was
a
fugitive
but
he
--
but
there
was
nothing
in
that
statement
to
indicate
that
he
knew
that
a
specific
order
was
entered
for
his
surrender
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
and
that's
what
he
was
charged
with.
mr.
john
j.
abt
surely,
sir.
his
bail
was
--
if
an
order
was
entered
forfeiting
his
bail
and
that
would
be
the
normal
thing
and
then
he
is
no
longer
be
on
bail,
he'd
be
a
fugitive
from
justice,
he
should
be
in
jail.
and
that
--
that
could
all
happen
without
entering
an
order
for
his
surrender.
he
wasn't
charged
just
by
being
a
fugitive
from
justice,
being
a
man
that
ought
to
be
in
jail
and
wasn't.
he
was
charged
with
contempt
because
he
knowingly
violated
a
specific
order
for
his
surrender.
mr.
john
j.
abt
he
had
a
duty
to
come
back,
your
honor.
the
question
is,
was
his
--
was
his
failure
to
perform
that
duty
a
contempt
and
it
wasn't
a
contempt
unless
he
knowingly
violated
an
order
for
his
surrender
and
my
--
my
whole
point
is
that
there
was
no
knowledge
that
he
had
--
no
evidence
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
issuance
of
the
order.
i
want
to
end
the
court
(inaudible).
