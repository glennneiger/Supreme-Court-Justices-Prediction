mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
i
shall
attempt
to
address
myself
to
the
questions
which
have
been
presented
by
petitioners
in
the
same
order
that
petitioners'
counsel
had
done
so.
that
brings
me
first
therefore
to
the
contention
that
the
government
failed
adequately
to
prove
in
this
case
that
the
petitioners
had
knowledge
of
the
order
which
they
were
charged
was
willfully
violated.
i'd
like
to
review
very
briefly
the
sequence
of
events,
the
circumstances
which
bear
on
the
question
of
proof
of
knowledge.
perhaps
first,
i
should
say
that
we
contend
on
two
bases
that
this
aspect
of
the
government
case
was
made
out.
the
first
is
that
petitioners
are
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
with
knowledge
of
the
order
which
was
ultimately
issued
and
the
second
is
that
there
was
an
adequate
basis
for
the
court's
finding
that
there
was
in
fact
such
knowledge
on
their
part.
now,
the
sequence
of
event
is
i
think
important.
as
pointed
out
earlier,
the
petitioners
were
out
on
bail
during
the
course
of
their
appeals
from
the
conviction
in
the
main
case.
the
affirmance
by
the
second
circuit
took
place
in
1950
and
this
court's
decision
in
the
dennis
case
was
handed
down
on
june
4,
1951.
thereafter,
an
application
was
made
to
mr.
justice
jackson
for
a
stay
of
this
court's
mandate.
it
was
denied.
the
united
states
attorney
thereafter
proceeded
on
june
28,
1951
to
serve
a
notice
on
all
of
the
defendants
in
the
dennis
case.
that
notice
was
served
together
with
a
proposed
order
and
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
57
of
the
notice
and
then
the
order
which
was
ultimately
signed
by
judge
ryan
appears
on
pages
59
and
60.
your
honors
will
note
that
that
is
an
order
on
mandate
which
is
specific,
which
is
complete
in
its
detail,
down
to
the
point
that
it
provides
that
the
defendant
shall
surrender
themselves
in
room
318
of
the
courthouse
at
foley
square
on
the
2nd
of
july
at
11:05
in
the
forenoon.
your
honors,
will
also
note
from
the
notice
of
settlement
of
that
order
on
page
57
that
the
application
for
the
signature
of
this
order
was
to
be
presented
at
10
o'clock
on
july
2nd.
in
substance
then,
the
u.s.
attorney
put
the
defendants
in
the
dennis
case
on
notice.
that
on
july
2nd
in
the
morning
and
july
2nd
was
a
monday,
he
would
present
to
the
court
for
signature
an
order
which
would
require
them
to
surrender
themselves
for
their
--
for
the
service
if
their
sentence
that
same
morning.
now,
as
i
say,
this
notice
of
settlement
and
the
proposed
order
was
served
on
june
28.
on
june
29,
friday,
june
29,
petitioners
through
their
counsel,
went
before
judge
ryan
who
was
the
judge
scheduled
to
sit
in
criminal
motions
for
the
following
monday.
and
as
petitioner's
counsel
has
pointed
out,
they
make
certain
motions.
one
of
the
motions
or
applications
which
they
presented
to
judge
ryan
on
friday,
june
29
was
their
request
made
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
dennis
defendants
that
the
dates
for
their
commitment,
they
put
over
until
after
the
july
4th
holiday.
judge
ryan
did
not
grant
that
motion.
he
did
not
act
on
any
of
the
applications
made.
he
did
tell
the
petitioner's
counsel
that
he
wanted
them
to
be
sure
to
bring
all
of
the
defendant
into
the
courtroom
on
the
following
monday
morning.
the
counsel
agreed
to
do
so.
and
as
testified
later
at
the
hearing
on
contempt,
counsel,
did
in
fact
inform
all
of
the
dennis
defendants
that
they
were
to
be
in
court
on
the
following
monday
morning.
now,
against
this
background
of
facts
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
29th,
a
wednesday.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
at
page
11.
there
is
a
--
some
of
that
colloquy
comes
in
the
form
of
a
quotation
of
the
earlier
colloquy
given
at
the
ultimate
hearing
on
contempt.
now,
these
circumstances
that
are
just
recited
seem
to
us
to
show
that
the
petitioners
on
june
29,
certainly,
knew
that
the
entry
of
the
order
on
mandate
was
certain
and
imminent.
incidentally,
i
have
not
mentioned
that
appears
also
that
the
reason
of
the
hearing
was
set
for
july
2nd
was
that
that
was
date
that
it
was
anticipated
that
this
court's
mandate
was
going
to
be
received
by
the
district
court.
in
other
words,
the
u.s.
attorney
had
ascertained
when
this
court's
mandate
would
come
down
and
he
had
learned
apparently
that
it
was
going
to
be
there
by
the
second
and
therefore
filed
--
prepared
an
order
which
would
have
permitted
the
dennis
defendants
on
that
day.
in
addition
to
being
aware
of
the
proposed
order
which
had
been
served
on
their
counsel,
petitioners
were
aware
that
the
united
state's
attorney
and
subsequently
judge
ryan
on
june
29
had
not
favorably
entertained
a
request
to
put
over
the
date
of
the
commitment
until
after
the
july
4th
holiday.
we
submit
in
a
word
that
petitioners
knew
that
the
end
of
the
road
has
been
reached
and
that
they
were
about
to
be
required
to
begin
asserting
their
sentences.
so
notified,
we
think,
petitioners
could
not
disappear
on
the
eve
or
the
virtual
eve
of
the
date
of
surrender
and
then
claim
that
they
were
not
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
the
order
as
issued.
anymore,
we
think,
than
somebody
who
knows
an
injunction
is
about
to
issue
can
go
out
and
change
the
facts
and
put
the
matter
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
before
the
judge
puts
it
in
to
paper.
anymore
we
think,
than
someone
about
to
be
served
and
knowing
he
is
about
to
be
served
with
an
order
for
production
of
document
can
go
out
and
say,
"we've
got
to
hurry
and
burn
the
papers,
the
judge
is
just
about
to
sign
the
order."
now,
we
think
that
is
the
fair
meaning
of
the
rule
stated
in
the
pettibone
case
to
which
mr.
abt
earlier
made
reference.
as
the
court
will
recall,
it
was
said
in
that
case
that
somebody
is
chargeable
if
he
had
--
or
is
not
chargeable
unless
he
at
least
has
notice
of
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings
or
that
an
application
is
about
to
be
made.
now,
here
we
say,
petitioners
knew
far
more
than
that
an
application
was
to
be
made.
well,
they
not
only
has
this
notice
of
settlement,
they
have
seen
the
proposed
order
complete
in
its
detail
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
at
least
their
counsel
had.
and
they
were
further
aware
that
they
had
been
summoned
through
their
counsel
by
judge
ryan
to
be
in
court
on
monday
morning,
july
2nd.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
counsel
in
court
with
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
all
the
four
of
the
dennis
defendants.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
record
does
not
show,
i
presume
from
what
is
shown
here
that
the
request
to
put
the
date
of
surrender
over
until
after
july
4th
was
renewed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it
was
not
over
to
them.
on
june
29th,
they
said
to
judge
ryan,
"we'd
like
to
have
a
later
date."
judge
ryan
didn't
take
final
action.
he
just
said
the
lawyers
will
--
i'll
see
about
that
later
but
you're
going
to
have
your
people
in
court
monday
morning.
so,
i
assume
they
renewed
that
request.
i'm
speculating
that
--
i
suppose
they
did
at
that
time.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
on
july
2,
of
course,
as
your
honors
know,
all
of
the
defendant
--
dennis
defendants
except
four,
including
these
two
petitioners
appeared,
these
two
petitioners
were
absent
for
four
and
one
half
years
thereafter.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there's
no
indication
that
any
change
was
made
in
the
order.
it
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
the
proposed
--
the
order
your
honors
see
on
pages
59
and
60
is
the
signed
order
which
corresponds
--
presumably
it's
the
same
copy
as
the
original,
the
proposed
order.
there's
no
suggestion
as
i
think,
petitioner's
counsel
agrees
that
there
was
any
variation
between
the
proposed
order
as
served
with
the
notice
of
settlement
and
the
order
as
ultimately
signed
several
days
later
by
judge
ryan.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
there
were
no
other
notices
in
the
--
in
the
contempt
aspects
in
the
course
that
i
am
familiar
of.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i've
been
arguing
up
to
this
point,
i
think
that
the
circumstances
are
sufficient
to
make
out.
the
petitioners
are
chargeable
with
knowledge
because
they
could
not
defeat
the
process
of
the
court
knowing
that
the
court
was
about
to
act
by
closing
their
ears
or
running
away
or
covering
their
eye.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
it's
--
now,
i
guess
to
the
case
i
mentioned
before,
a
party
to
a
civil
proceeding
goes
in
to
court
to
apply
for
an
order
of
production
and
he
gets
the
matter
set
for
hearing
before
a
judge.
the
other
party
gets
wind
of
it
and
says,
"i'm
going
to
defeat
this
possibility
before
the
order
is
entered."
it
seems
to
me
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
law
in
order
to
protect
his
own
processes
must
hold
that
the
party
who
knew
the
action
to
be
pending
may
not
without
committing
contempt
of
the
court
altered
the
situation
so
as
to
place
it
beyond
the
capacity
of
the
court
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
think
the
way
in
which
the
law
has
put
that
is
in
terms
of
saying
he
is
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
with
knowledge.
now,
i
think
further
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
he
becomes
responsible
for
the
situation
that
he
has
created
if
the
order
then
does
issue.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
have
a
further
point
to
make
on
this
question
of
knowledge
because
petitioners
made
rather
elaborate
statements
not
to
be
sure
in
court
but
in
press
releases
and
in
press
interviews
contemporaneous
--
contemporaneously
with
their
surrender
four
and
a
half
years
later.
those
statements
were
made
a
part
of
the
record
at
the
hearing
on
contempt.
now,
in
those
statements,
petitioners
flatly
asserted
that
they
took
flight
as
a
means
of
asserting
resistance
to
and
protest
against
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
main
case
and
as
a
means
of
publicizing
their
cause.
more
pointedly,
their
statements
show
that
petitioners
knew
they
were
fugitives
during
the
entire
period
of
their
absence.
they
--
they
stated
that,
we
are
ceasing
on
such
and
such
a
date
to
be
fugitive.
the
choice
we
made
five
years
ago,
we
made
for
such
and
such
reasons.
so
we
think
that
this
was
a
calculated
matter.
there
was
no
question
about
the
motive
for
departure.
there
is
a
further
point
to
be
made
in
the
same
connection.
petitioners
didn't
become
fugitives
until
an
order
did
issue.
a
recognizance
did
not
contain
a
direction
to
appear
at
any
specific
time
and
place.
they
were
at
liberty
under
that
recognizance
until
further
order
of
the
court.
the
recognizant
appears
at
pages
55
and
56,
i
believe,
of
the
record.
your
honor
will
note
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
on
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
top
of
the
next
page.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
55
at
the
bottom.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
56
at
the
top.
that
they
are
to
surrender
if
the
judgment
appealed
from
shall
be
affirmed
on
such
day
or
days
as
well.
to
surrender
on
such
day,
the
court
may
direct
or
in
the
event
of
retrial,
on
such
a
day
or
days
as
the
court
may
direct.
therefore,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
petitioner's
acknowledgement
that
they
were
knowingly
fugitives
from
justice
during
the
entire
period
of
their
absence,
carries
with
it
by
necessary
implication,
knowledge
that
the
court
had
acted.
that
it
had
not
continued
their
enlargement
on
bail
but
had
entered
the
order
which
terminated
such
enlargement.
i
turn
then
secondly
to
petitioner's
argument
that
willful
disobedience
of
an
order
to
surrender
for
--
for
commitment
should
not
be
deemed
a
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
we
take
the
position
that
it
was
inferable
from
the
fact
that
they
knew
and
also
that
those
same
facts
and
circumstances
made
them
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
with
knowledge.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
that
there
were
many
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
situations
in
which
knowledge
was
attributable
on
the
basis
of
circumstances.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
that
one
could
invoke
a
theory
of
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
in
a
situation
where
there
was
not
a
wholly
rational
basis
for
making
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
for
a
holding,
it
was
possible.
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
the
same
circumstances
which
support
the
inference
of
fact,
supports
the
strong
policy
consideration
that
you
won't
permit
a
person
to
say,
"i
didn't
know
because
i
closed
my
eyes.
even
though
i
was
told
a
few
seconds
ago
that
it
was
going
to
happen."
in
that
kind
of
situation,
i
think
there
is
no
unfairness
in
attributing
knowledge.
i
don't
see
how
the
law
could
operate
in
respect
of
many
of
its
orders
if
it
were
open
to
parties
as
soon
as
they
ascertain
that
the
court
was
going
to
act
in
order
to
preserve
a
situation
to
change
it,
and
thus,
to
frustrate
the
process
of
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
would
--
i
would
certainly
agree
with
the
--
with
your
honor
that
this
chargeable
as
a
matter
of
law
cannot
be
invoked
in
a
situation
where
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
then
obvious
fiction.
i
think
it
is
anything
and
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
there
must
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
i
think
that
the
law
can
imply
knowledge
in
certain
circumstances
where
to
fail
to
do
so
would
be
to
permit
the
party
to
set
the
law
--
not
and
where
the
presumption
or
inference
of
--
as
of
law
is
a
rational
one
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
as
i
will
think
it
to
be
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
this
was
not
because
i
think
the
presumption
that
these
people
knew
that
the
order
had
issued.
when
they
knew
that
it
was
certain
and
imminent
and
they
fled
on
the
eve
of
the
departure,
and
then
the
order
did
in
fact
issue
and
was
a
public
matter
is
not
arbitrary.
but
i
think
in
any
event,
if
your
honors
disagree
with
that
as
to
that
that
the
admission
by
the
petitioners,
when
they
surrendered
that
they
knew
the
entire
time
they
were
gone
that
they
were
fugitives
with
the
fact
from
which
the
court
could
infer
that
there
was
actual
knowledge
taking
that
together
with
the
sequence
of
events
leading
up
to
their
departure.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
there
might
be
impotence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
there
might
be
impotence
if
you
couldn't
proceed
on
the
basis
of
disobedience
of
an
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
we
rest
on
the
fact
that
an
order
was
issued.
i
would
not
argue
that
if
the
petitioners
here
had
left
new
york
and
absconded
the
day
after
this
court's
dennis
decision
that
there
would
have
been
a
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
for
induction
in
military
service?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
here,
we
are
operating
under
18
u.s.c.
401
which
would
not
be
applicable
in
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
certainly,
i
--
i
would
certainly
think
there
was
no
doubt
that
if
the
contempt
power
is
to
be
efficacious
at
all,
if
the
courts
can
implement
their
orders
that
they
have
to
implement
them
whether
the
violation
is
affirmative
action
or
inaction.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
indication
that
there
could
have
been
a
basis
for
charging
conspiracy
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
leaving
out
the
elements
of
conspiracy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it
is
now
of
course,
there's
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
under
the
1954
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
then
i
think
it
would
have
been
under
the
--
concluded
in
the
family
of
offenses
which
relates
to
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice.
petitioners,
i
may
say
don't
contend
and
they
never
contended
that
this
was
an
independent
crime
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
or
that
there
was
any
avenue
other
than
the
contempt
process
which
would
had
--
which
was
open
to
the
government.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we've
argued
both
from
(inaudible).
turning
to
the
second
argument
that
petitioners
had
made,
it
is
that
contempt
doesn't
cover
willful
disobedience
of
an
order
to
surrender
for
commitment.
now,
of
course,
18
u.s.c.
401
covers
willful
disobedience
of
any
lawful
order
of
the
court.
and
therefore,
what
petitioners
are
saying
is
that
this
court
should
carve
out
an
exception
for
the
class
of
orders
of
the
type
here
involved.
and
it
supports
that
by
saying
that
there
are
no
common
law
cases
involving
the
matter
of
treating
absconding
as
a
contempt
and
therefore,
the
argument
is,
you
shouldn't
regard
it
as
within
the
historic
framework
or
historic
meaning
of
contempt
to
court
as
used
in
these
country's
contempt
statutes
since
1789.
now,
we
think
to
rely
on
the
common
law
here
is
to
look
at
history
through
blinders.
it's
true
that
one
who
was
indicted
for
a
crime
at
common
law
and
then
failed
to
appear
at
his
trial
was
not
attached
for
contempt
but
the
reason
was
that
the
common
law
had
available
to
it,
what
was
a
greatly
heightened
form
of
contempt
process
with
far
more
baneful
sanction,
the
process
with
outlawry,
which
pollock
and
maitland
described
as
an
engine
for
compelling
the
contumacious
and
i
emphasize
that
word
to
abide
the
judgment
of
the
courts.
now,
if
a
criminal
defendant
failed
to
appear
after
having
been
five
times
summoned
for
his
trial.
if
he
failed
to
appear
at
common
law,
he
was
a
convict
of
outlawry.
that
meant
that
there
was
a
total
forfeiture
of
his
property.
it
meant
that
anybody
might
hunt
him
down
because
he
was
beyond
the
bail
and
protection
of
the
law.
it
meant
that
he's
apprehended.
he
stood
convict
without
further
trial
of
the
substantive
offense
for
which
he
had
been
indicted
which
in
turn
meant
that
if
he
had
been
indicted
originally
for
a
common
law
felony
that
he
was
subject
to
capital
punishment.
so,
it
will
hardly
do,
i
think,
to
suggest
that
the
failure
of
a
criminal
defendant
to
answer
the
process
of
the
court
was
likely
regarded
as
common
law.
professor
beale
has
stated
in
his
article
on
contempt
of
court
that
the
word
"contempt"
is
a
very
old
word
to
cover
any
act
done
in
violation
of
a
direct
order
of
the
king
for
any
governmental
process.
he
goes
on
to
show
in
that
same
article
that
some
of
the
earliest
cases
of
contempt
and
trial
of
contempts
by
courts
involved
failures
of
parties
to
appear
in
response
to
process.
he
mentioned
that
in
the
time
of
henry
ii.
it
was
laid
down
that
if
a
tenant
duly
summoned
in
the
court
was
absent,
the
king
or
his
justices
might
have
their
pleasure,
punish
him
for
his
contempt
of
court.
now,
a
common
place
of
course
to
this
day,
that
a
witness
who
fails
to
respond
to
a
subpoena,
a
party
who
fails
to
produce
documents
in
response
to
an
order
of
discovery,
a
party
who
fails
to
honor
other
form
of
process
is
liable
in
contempt.
and
we
see
no
basis
for
making
the
suggestion
that
a
criminal
defendant
and
especially
one
who
has
first
exhausted
all
the
processes
of
the
law
that
there's
any
left
to
contempt
for
him
to
flout
the
order
of
the
court
to
appear
and
to
begin
serving
his
penalty.
petitioners
also
say
that
if
this,
as
the
government
argues,
is
a
contempt
within
a
classic
category,
why
is
it
that
there
are
no
other
reported
cases
involving
a
proceeding
for
contempt
for
a
violation
of
this
kind
of
order.
i
think
that
the
dearth
of
such
cases
has
a
ready
explanation.
under
the
contempt
statutes,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
basis
for
a
proceeding
unless,
first,
a
specific
order
had
been
laid
at
the
door
of
the
party
who
was
to
appear.
and
in
the
nature
of
things,
most
bail
jumping
occurs
before
the
court
ever
gets
around
to
setting
a
time
and
place
certain
for
a
hearing.
if
in
this
case,
as
i
earlier
remarked,
the
petitioners
had
left
town
the
day
this
court
decided
the
dennis
case.
there
would
have
been
no
notice
of
settlement
of
an
order
of
mandate,
no
possibility
of
serving
such
a
notice
on
them
and
i
don't
think
we
could
lay
a
foundation
by
way
of
showing
the
issuance
of
a
specific
order
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
which
will
support
a
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
401
is
limited
in
its
definitions
of
contempt.
it
says,
the
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
power
to
punish
by
fine
or
imprisonment,
at
its
discretion,
such
contempt
of
authority
and
none
other.
that's
on
page
82
of
that
statute
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
the
first
subparagraph
is
misbehavior
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
failure
to
appear
would
not
be
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
paragraph
two
which
relates
to
officers
of
the
court
is
not
applicable.
so
i
think
necessarily,
if
it
is
a
contempt,
as
we
think
it
was
in
these
circumstances,
it
must
come
under
subparagraph
(3),
which
embraces
disobedience
or
resistance
to
its
lawful
writ,
process,
order,
rule,
decree,
or
command.
now,
the
first
command,
the
first
order
of
a
specific
nature
to
appear
was
the
order
of
july
2.
i
don't
think
that
the
mere
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
the
main
case
would
have
the
specificity
of
that
--
of
the
command,
which
would
be,
i
take
it,
a
necessary
foundation
for
charge
of
willful
disobedience.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
did
the
petitioners?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
court?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
not
until
between
that
time
and
the
signature
of
the
order?
is
that
what
your
honor
has
in
mind?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
so,
the
answer
is
no.
they
appeared
by
counsel.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
four
and
a
half
years
after.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
extending
the
contempt
power
considerably
more
than
any
application
here
of
the
contempt
statute
would
require
because
here
we're
relying
on
an
order
which
is
much
more
specific.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly,
if
he
knew
about
the
--
the
order
will
stand.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
no
one
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
say
at
common
law
and
in
the
18th
century
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
as
well
the
process
by
which
criminal
defendants
were
punished.
if
they
absconded
before
trial
with
the
process
of
outlawry
which
was
much
more
severe
and
heightened,
if
you
will,
contempt
sanction
than
the
attachment
for
contempt.
outlawry
of
course
was
imported
into
this
country
during
the
colonial
period
and
it
fell
into
its
use
in
the
early
19th
century.
what
i'm
saying
more
broadly
here
is
that
--
that
common
law,
every
--
virtually
every
form
of
violation
of
order
and
particularly
every
form
of
violations
the
king's
writ,
the
king's
process
which
was
punished
by
attachment
for
contempt.
beale
so
state
facts
in
his
research
emphasizes
that
an
early
form
of
contempt
at
common
law
was
the
form
of
order
disobedience.
at
the
very
early
--
at
the
very
earliest,
it
was
disobedience
of
the
king's
writ
and
then
it
became
--
came
to
be
extended
soon
thereafter
to
disobedience
of
the
rule
of
the
court
or
decision
of
the
court.
but
that
is
an
ancient
form
of
contempt
which
has
been
punished
continuously
under
every
american
contempt
statute
since
and
--
since
1789
by
words
which
say
willful
disobedience
of
any
lawful
order
of
the
court.
now,
i
cannot
see
with
such
comprehensive
language
in
the
application
of
it
to
all
forms
of
disobedience
process
that
there
is
any
reason
to
state
that
disobedience
of
an
order
of
criminal
defendant
to
appear
in
court
is
somehow
an
exception,
assuming
we
have
the
necessary
foundation
of
such
disobedience
an
order
here
because
certainly
that
would
seem
a
formal
--
a
serious
form
of
contempt.
then
let
us
say,
a
witness
in
a
civil
case,
perhaps
failing
to
get
there
and
coming
in
a
few
hours
late
and
being
held
in
contempt.
here,
the
refusal
was
a
refusal
to
obey
an
order
to
begin
serving
a
sentence
which
had
been
imposed,
which
had
been
tested
on
appeal
and
affirmed
by
the
highest
court
in
the
land.
if
it
was
a
contempt,
it
seems
to
me,
it
was
quite
serious
and
aggravated
one
as
well.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
know
how
strict
the
common
law
was
in
insisting
our
knowledge
but
i
am
certainly
ready
to
concede
that
we
are
required
through
willfulness
under
the
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
this
case,
we
have
to
prove
willful
disobedience.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
charge
was
willful
disobedience
and
knowing
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
can
refer,
your
honor
to
the
citation
for
contempt.
i
think
we
are
required
under
the
citation
for
contempt
to
show
that
this
order
was
willfully
disobeyed
with
knowledge
of
its
issuance.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
there,
of
course,
bail
after
conviction
was
quite
un
--
well,
more
than
uncommon.
i
suppose
unheard
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
at
common
law,
to
the
early
common
law.
so
all
of
the
cases
of
outlawry
are
instances
in
which
somebody
is
at
large
prior
to
trial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
in
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
of
course
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
is
talking
certainly
in
the
context
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
outlawry
of
a
criminal
defense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
cited
several
of
those
early
outlawry
cases
in
our
briefs.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
fact,
it
would
invariably
be
so
applied
because
he
wouldn't
be
out
on
bail
after
a
conviction.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
the
--
we
said
clearly
within
the
statute's
language
and
the
reason
i
refer
to
the
process
of
outlawry
is
solely
by
way
of
explaining
petitioner's
comment
that
there
were
no
contempt
cases
for
--
arising
out
of
absconding
at
common
law.
i
was
merely
remarking,
at
common
law,
they
had
a
much
more
severe
process
which
was
employed
as
against
the
criminal
defendant
who
absconded
the
day
of
the
trial.
of
course
after
trial,
you
never
have
the
situation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
to
surrender,
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
petitioner's
contention
is
that
such
an
order
is
somehow
accepted
or
should
be
accepted
despite
the
comprehensive
language
of
401.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
we
have
for
other
purposes,
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
constitutional
argument
which
petitioners
make
in
this
case
made
a
rather
intensive
effort
to
find
and
i'll
come
to
it
later,
whether
there
was
any
in
discussion
at
all
of
the
contempt
power
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention
or
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
we'd
look
at
the
convention
proceedings
and
the
ratification
proceedings,
the
annals
of
congress
as
the
first
ten
amendments.
as
i
say
in
relation
to
the
argument
that
contempt
is
within
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
well,
this
i
think
maybe
relevant
to
the
constitutional
argument
later,
so
i'll
complete
the
thought.
we
did
not
find
any
reference
at
the
constitutional
convention
to
the
matter
of
contempt
at
all
and
we
looked
in
the
writings
as
well
of
many
of
the
leading
figures
of
the
constitutional
period
with
that
same
result.
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
briefly
with
the
statutory
language
for
petitioners
who
are
arguing
that
on
their
third
point
that
there
is
a
statutory
basis
for
implying
a
one
year
limitation
on
the
fine
or
imprisonment
which
may
be
imposed
in
a
criminal
contempt
case.
i've
already
referred
to
section
401
and
if
the
court
is
aware
in
terms,
it
says
that
the
power
to
punish
by
fine
or
imprisonment
at
its
discretion
is
conferred
upon
the
court.
now,
that
language
at
its
discretion
is
not
ambiguous,
it
seems
to
us,
and
it
has
been
in
every
contempt
statute
since
1789.
the
argument
is
then
made
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
the
contempt
statute
confers
discretion
as
to
the
quantum
of
the
punishment
to
be
imposed
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
by
way
of
fine
or
by
way
of
imprisonment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
the
power
to
punish
by
fine
or
imprisonment
means
you
can
do
either.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
therefore,
that
the
word
"at
its
discretion"
if
they
are
not
redundant
means
that
the
court
shall
have
discretion
as
to
the
amount
of
punishment
in
whichever
of
the
due
form
imposed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
certainly
think
that
discretion
can
be
abused
and
that
the
court
--
and
that
the
appellate
court
and
this
court
would
not
approve
a
sentence
in
a
contempt
case
which
it
believes
to
be
inordinate.
the
court
has
assumed
in
the
past
the
--
that
it
has
the
power
to
abuse
sentences
in
contempt
even
though
it
has
proclaimed
from
reviewing
sentences
in
a
case
of
violation
of
the
criminal
law.
so
i
think
there's
always
open
a
question
and
such
a
question
--
such
a
contention
is
made
here,
always
open
to
a
person
held
in
contempt
to
argue
the
sentence
was
represented
in
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
i
can
only
refer
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
the
district
judge
is
to
consider
the
various
circumstances,
the
gravity
of
the
contempt,
the
amount
of
the
harm
done,
the
duration
of
the
contempt.
the
court
laid
down
such
standards
in
--
in
the
united
mine
workers
case,
which
it
was
based
with
the
rather
novel
problem
of
deciding
whether
to
who
they
fine,
i
suppose,
unheard
of
proportion
at
that
time,
a
three
and
a
half
million
dollar
fine.
this
court
ultimately
concluded
that
it
should
affirm
that
fine
to
the
extent
of
$700,000
and
that
modified
the
district
court's
judgment.
now,
i
--
i
think
that
it's
inherent
in
--
in
every
case
of
criminal
contempt
that
the
judge
must
exercise
the
discretion
which
the
statute
accords.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
think
a
reasonable
punishment
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
seriousness
of
the
offense.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
--
it
would
be
a
matter
of
discretion.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
could
intervene
only
when
it
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
prohibition
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
history
of
the
contempt
statutes
at
all
to
indicate
that
anybody
meant
for
contempt
to
be
either
a
misdemeanor
or
--
or
a
felony.
i
think
it
was
never
regarded
in
either
one
but
it
was
regarded
as
something
which
had
grown
up
in
the
process
of
the
law
as
a
distinct
cut
board.
the
courts
in
certain
areas
have
been
exercising
contempt
power
over
a
period
of
some
hundreds
years.
sir
john
fox,
in
his
study
which
we
referred
to
extensively
in
our
brief,
the
english
experience,
points
out
that
parliament,
though
has
done
so
in
the
case
with
almost
every
other
type
of
offense
has
never
faced
the
limitation
as
the
power
to
punish
or
contempt
which
is
always
been
deemed
to
be
a
power
that
the
courts
have
had,
had
inherently
many
judges
have
said
and
similarly
in
this
country,
congress
has
never
written
any
limitation
into
the
law.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
clayton
act
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
as
to
penalty?
no,
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
said
that
some
have
--
have
described
it
as
inherent,
your
honor,
as
i
have
stated.
i
said
the
--
the
argument
in
the
contempt
power
and
particularly
the
contempt
power
where
the
disobedience
is
of
a
writ
or
the
process
of
the
court
goes
back
to
earliest
time
of
common
law
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
stand
on
that
statement,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
what
fox
establishes
in
his
research
about
the
common
law
is
this,
that
constructive
contempts
commenced
--
contempt,
if
you
please,
by
strangers
to
the
proceeding,
committed
out
of
the
presence
of
a
court,
were
tried
at
early
common
law
by
ordinary
criminal
law
procedures,
matters
such
as
libel
upon
a
judge.
and
he
argues
that
it
wasn't
until
the
early
18th
century
that
such
constructive
contempts
were
dealt
with
by
attachment
for
contempt
rather
than
by
ordinary
criminal
law
procedures.
he
says
at
the
same
time
that
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
contempt
by
disobedience
of
process
or
court
order
was
punished
from
early
common
law
through
attachment
for
contempt.
so,
i
think
that
this
historical
error
which
has
been
referred
to
upon
examination
is
this,
that
it
has
been
erroneously
assumed
that
constructive
contempts
were
punished
from
earliest
times
by
the
contempt
process.
in
other
words,
what
fox's
research
showed
and
what
fox
aimed
to
prove
or
to
induce
was
to
have
parliament
provide
by
statute,
essentially
what
this
court
did
by
statutory
interpretation
in
the
nye
case,
told
that
constructive
contempts,
contempts
by
parties
outside
the
courtroom,
people
who
were
strangers
to
the
proceeding
and
not
under
any
order,
could
only
be
tried
through
the
criminal
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
--
in
the
case
of
any
act
of
disobedience
such
as
we
have
in
this
case
in
which
the
act
was
independently
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law,
there
would
be
a
limit
on
the
sentence
by
virtue
of
section
21
and
section
22
of
the
clayton
act.
where,
however,
a
contempt
is
not
an
independent
crime
then
the
limitation
is
the
discretion
of
the
court
appropriately
exercised
in
the
last
analysis
in
the
judgment
of
this
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
knew
of
no
facts
which
would
enable
be
to
say
that
there
had
been
a
conspiracy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
if
there
had
been
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
an
agreement,
it
might
have
been
within
conspiracy
statutes.
now,
i
didn't
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
state
what
the
limit
of
punishment
on
that
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
it
is
more
than
a
year,
your
honor
but
i
would
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
give
a
categorical
answer
to
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
know
the
--
i
would
have
to
check
the
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice
statute
because
there
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
there
has
been
in
this
case
nothing
about
conspiracy.
these
are
--
are
two
men
who
were
--
who
were
both
charged
with
contempt
out
of
events
arising
at
the
same
time.
i
don't
know
that
they
conspired
with
one
another
to
something.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
their
statements
were
individual.
there's
nothing
in
their
statements
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
to
show
that
they
acted
in
--
in
accordance,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
a
word,
if
i
may
about
the
clayton
act
provision,
as
we
read
that
provision
in
section
24,
it
was
designed
simply
as
the
history
of
the
clayton
act
contempt
provisions
show
to
state
that
the
jury
trial
provisions,
which
were
written
in
1914
for
a
special
class
of
cases,
so
it's
coming
within
section
21,
were
not
to
be
deemed
applicable
to
other
types
of
cases.
the
clayton
act
which
was
--
the
courts
passed
as
a
result
of
criticism
of
many
broad
injunctions
in
labor
union
cases
was
designed
to
provide
that
disobedience
of
injunction,
where
the
disobedience
was
also
an
independent
crime
should
be
tried
upon
the
man
being
accused
by
a
jury.
and
section
24
simply
expresses
that
thought.
there
is
nothing
in
section
24,
as
we
read
it
which
relates
to
any
substantive
matter
and
certainly
nothing
which
relates
to
the
quantum
of
punishment
that
maybe
imposed.
certainly,
congress
knew
how
to
establish
a
maximum
punishment
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
in
section
22,
it
said
six
months
and
a
thousand
dollar
fine
where
the
offense
is
also
an
independent
crime.
it
has
never
attempted
in
any
statute
that
we
know
of
to
delimit
the
power
to
punish
criminal
contempts
by
the
court.
i'm
talking
now
as
to
the
question
of
penalty.
the
1831
act
which
justice
black
mentioned
earlier
eliminated
the
power
to
punish
so-called
constructive
contempts.
but
so
far
as
we
know
that
there's
never
been
any
attempt
by
congress
in
a
statute
to
say
that
the
limit
is
three
months,
six
months,
a
year
or
two
years
or
whatever
it
is.
and
this
court,
we
think,
has
always
proceeded
on
the
assumption
notably
in
the
united
mine
workers
case
where
the
criteria
is
set
forth
that
the
test
is
the
discretion
of
the
court,
reasonably
exercised.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
last
sentence
of
that
said
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
inhibit
the
power
of
the
court
to
punish
for
contempt.
yes,
i
--
that
statute
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
clayton
act
would
limit
the
maximum
punishment
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
to
six
months
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
it
was
independently
a
violation
of
another
statute.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
you
could
--
the
man
could
get
five
years
for
absconding
under
the
bail
jumping
statute
and
then
get
an
additional
sentence
under
--
for
a
violation
of
a
specific
order
to
appear
in
excess
of
six
months
because
if
you
--
if
he
was
triable
under
this
criminal
statute,
then
i
think
the
clayton
act
provision
comes
into
play.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
defines
a
crime?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
402
was
the
contempt
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor
is
reading
from
section
402
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
crime,
for
some
purposes
where
the
purpose
of
invoking
certain
rights
this
court
have
said,
certainly
not
a
crime,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
within
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
for
common
understanding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
adds
nothing
to
the
concept
of
criminal
contempt,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there's
no
dispute
that
this
is
a
criminal
contempt,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that
criminal
contempt,
your
honor
certainly
entitles
the
accused
to
many
of
the
same
protections
than
on
the
basis
of
the
due
process
clause
which
is
available
to
criminal
defendant.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
judiciary
act
was
codifying
the
common
law,
was
saying
the
court
shall
have
the
power
--
that
the
lower
federal
court
shall
have
the
power
to
punish
all
contempts
with
their
authority
and
that
was
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
certainly,
so
far
as
--
we
don't
have
any
question
of
double
prosecution
here
in
this
case
of
course.
but,
so
far
as
what
this
court
has
said
and
so
far
as
i
know
on
deviating
them
in
the
past,
contempt
is
not
a
crime
within
the
fifth
or
sixth
amendment
and
somebody
made
the
charge
with
a
contempt
and
also
punished
for
a
crime
which
is
committed
by
virtue
of
the
same
act
which
constitutes
the
contempt.
of
course,
the
clayton
act
is
recognition
of
fact.
it
--
it
says
that
if
the
--
if
the
contempt
rule
is
taken,
he
cannot
be
punished
beyond
a
certain
limitation.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
that,
i
take
it
was
that
congress
did
not
want
resort
to
the
contempt
power
to
increase
the
penalty
or
to
avoid
the
proceedings,
ordinary
criminal
law
provision,
in
cases
where
the
matter
fall
within
the
criminal
law
domain.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
my
judgment
would
be,
that
as
long
as
the
power
which
the
court
is
exercising,
if
the
contempt
power
as
it
existed
at
common
law
and
as
it
was
conferred
on
the
lower
federal
court,
first
by
the
1789
act
and
later
by
a
successor
contempt
statute
that
so
long
as
that
is
the
case,
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
do
not
apply.
i
hardly
think
that
i
could
state
as
a
matters
categorically
as
this
court
stated
it
in
--
in
the
myers
case
and
then
through
chief
justice
hughes
in
the
--
in
the
blackmer
case
in
which
the
court
stated
while
contempts
maybe
an
offense
against
the
law
and
subject
to
appropriate
punishment,
certain
it
is,
that
since
the
foundation
of
our
government,
proceedings
upon
such
offenses
has
regarded
as
sui
generis
and
not
criminal
prosecutions
within
the
sixth
amendment
for
a
common
understanding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
take
it
that
i
would
be
correct
in
saying
that
the
contempt
statute
since
1831
leave
in
the
federal
courts
a
portion
of
the
contempt
power
which
would
exercise
as
common
law
and
it
has
cut
away
a
part.
