frankfurter
do
you
--
you
argue
that
there's
a
negative
showing?
that
it
wasn't
punished
this
way
that
there
in
the
clayton
act
it
was
put
in
this
provision
according
to
custom
etcetera.
and
since
there
wasn't
any
case
like
this,
therefore,
there
was
no
power
to
have
a
case
like
this.
therefore
it
was
written
impliedly
into
the
clayton
act,
is
that
it?
that's
a
fair
summary
of
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
--
you
also
said
that
the
conception
of
infamous
didn't
come
until
1889
or
whatever
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
w1hat
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
conception
of
infamous
to
which
you
were
addressing
yourself
relates
to
so-called
technical
crime,
that
i
call
technical
crime,
i
thought
it
might
accept
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
does
the
concept
infamous
crime
comes
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
meaning
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
the
source
of
its
relevance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
so
that
all
your
talk
presupposes
that
the
concept
of
infamous
crimes
in
the
fifth
amendment
relates
to
contempts,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
that
covers
your
argument.
but
that
--
that's
the
basis
and
source
for
discussing
what
is
an
infamous
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
isn't
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
that
in
1789
when
the
first
judiciary
act
was
written
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
thought
of
contempt
in
terms
of
crimes
under
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
we
get
to
infamous
crimes,
we
have
to
determine
whether
contempt
or
contempts
or
the
contempts
that's
covered
by
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
if
they
are
covered
by
the
fifth
amendment,
then
they
would
have
had
to
think
about
infamous
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so,
all
this
elaborate
argument
presupposes
that
infamous
crime
covers
the
--
that
contempt
equals
crime,
punishment
probably
determines
rather
a
crime
is
infamous
or
not.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
you
first
have
to
--
you
first
have
to
establish
that
a
contempt
that
in
1789,
a
contempt
was
covered
by
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
won't
assume
something
that
is
contrary
to
fact.
but
why
isn't
it
necessary
on
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
isn't
my
point.
my
point
is,
it
isn't
a
crime
within
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
a
very
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
even
on
your
hypothesis,
it
may
not
prove
that
it's
limited
constitutionally.
they
limit
it
statutorily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
from
myself,
unless
you
--
unless
you
stand
on
the
proposition
on
which
you
do
stand,
i
understand
that
part
of
the
argument,
namely
that
a
contempt
is
covered
by
the
fifth
amendment,
all
this
talk
about
infamous
--
infamous
punishment
is
calculated
i
think,
if
i
may
say
so,
to
be
a
foggy
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
--
i've
made
the
reservation
that
i
understand
your
proposition,
that
contempt
is
a
crime,
then
i
follow
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
order
to
do
that,
you
have
to
establish
what
you've
tried
doing
what
i
call
in
a
negative
way
that
the
fact
that
you
can't
produce
a
case
during
that
whole
period,
proves
that
the
power
wasn't
there
and
the
usage
was
against
it.
that
nonexistence
of
a
usage
proves
the
usage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
didn't
say
that
with
reference
to
any
constitutional
protection,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
has
to
do
with
statute
of
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
had
any
difficult,
mr.
spritzer
that
the
logical
argument
that
one
cannot
very
well
disobey
an
order
that
that
is
not
in
existence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
chargeable
with
knowledge,
what
was
known
by
them
--
it's
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
what
happened
up
to
the
time
that
you
charge
them
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
go
beyond
that
as
a
logical
argument
and
you
charge
them
with
disobeying
something
that
hasn't
existed
certainly
when
they
took
to
heal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
may
--
you
may
--
i'm
not
denying
what
you've
said
but
one
may
say
that
you
--
it
doesn't
follow
because
you
can
charge
them
with
contempt
of
frustrating
in
order
to
be
made
that
he
has
violated
an
order
that
had
not
been
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
may
be
chargeable
with
knowledge
that
there
will
be
an
order
but
has
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
there
is
a
logical
problem
there,
isn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
--
this
may
be
a
question
in
a
larger
sense
of
pleading
maybe
that
he's
been
put
into
contempt
for
something
or
that
he
should
have
been
put
into
contempt
for
something
else
for
--
for
aborting
that
which
he
well
knew
within
due
course
come
to
pass.
that's
really
what
he
did,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
mine
is
a
much
narrower
point,
namely,
not
that
the
law
hasn't
--
the
means
for
dealing
with
the
situation
whereby
a
man
frustrated
either
the
production
of
documents
or
the
production
of
himself
but
that
the
act
of
frustration
may
be
the
basis
--
may
be
later
the
basis
for
contempts
rather
than
the
fact
that
he
violated
something
which
he's
prevented
from
coming
to
pass,
namely,
that
he
should
be
in
court
when
he
was
told
to
be
in
court
at
2
o'clock.
so,
that
--
i
--
i
just
want
to
indicate
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
there's
impotence
on
the
part
of
the
law
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
a
situation
but
maybe
a
problem
really
of
pleading.
so
we
have
(voice
overlap)
some
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
haven't
--
we've
had
some
cases
here
in
which
the
court
divided
on
other
than
--
other
aspects
about
making
a
crime,
the
failure
to
be
at
a
particular
place.
would
the
--
what
do
you
call
that
cases,
service
cases,
that
a
man
should
report,
didn't
we
have
cases
in
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
induction,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he's
told
to
be
in
baltimore
next
monday
and
he
isn't
there.
now,
is
there
any
comparison
between
that
and
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
of
course
not.
but
i
mean
the
fact
--
the
non-action,
the
non-appearance
when
there
is
a
knowledge
of
a
duty
to
appear,
create
the
responsibility,
the
violation
of
which
is
just
as
much
within
the
competence
of
--
of
the
law
as
--
as
knocking
a
man
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
couldn't
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
you
charge
him
with
making
--
making
himself
unavailable
for
what
he
is
rightly
to
be
charged
with
knowledge
that
the
supreme
court
affirmed
the
conviction
that
then
automatically
and
mechanically
is
a
direction
to
the
lower
court
to
summon
in
the
defendant
who's
out
on
bail
and
then
carry
out
the
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
but
i
--
and
take
us
off
the
track
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
hypothetical
case
i
put
wouldn't
be
a
resistance
to
the
command
of
this
court,
it's
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
directed
to
the
individual
as
such.
maybe
i
wouldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
would
have
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
that
it
--
of
the
order
doesn't
have
to
be
directed
to
him.
if
he
--
a
resistance
--
i
should
think
preventing
another
person
from
carrying
out
a
command
of
the
court
would
be
a
resistance
to
its
command,
wouldn't
it?
however,
that
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
trouble
about
this,
agreeing,
having
known
what
was
done
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings
up
to
july
2nd,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
i
--
i
have
not
had
a
chance
to
go
and
i
haven't
looked
at
the
cases
which
judge
clark
cites
showing
the
use
of
outlawry
in
some
of
the
states
in
the
early
days
of
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
those
cases
of
outlawry
with
reference
to
this
kind
of
thing
or
other
problem
--
other
uses
of
outlawry
to
various
purposes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
--
these
are
outlawry
with
reference
to
jumping
bail,
are
they,
these
cases
of
his?
my
reference
is
to
--
to
his
statement
that
in
the
early
days
of
this
country,
outlawry
was
rather
rigorously
employed.
remember
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
his
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
i
was
wondering
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there's
outlawry
for
all
sorts
of
things
at
common
law
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
outlawry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap).
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
for
the
next
24
hours,
i
wish
you
do,
span
of
the
time
to
ascertain
this.
i
noticed
that
in
the
cases
referred
to
by
judge
clark
of
uses
of
outlawry
for
this
kind
of
thing,
for
the
purpose
you've
just
indicated,
showed
there
aren't
any
common
law
cases
because
they
were
worst
and
severe.
i
noticed
there
are
several
virginia
cases
that
would
interest
me
to
know
whether
jefferson
(inaudible)
the
virginia
law,
after
virginia
and
the
rest
of
the
state
separated
in
1776
in
order
to
call
out
all
the
hardships
or
the
cruelty
of
the
common
law,
whether
in
jefferson's
post
criminal
code
of
virginia,
i
don't
if
he
--
the
virginia
cases
for
virginia,
etcetera.
what
light
can
we
get
from
the
jefferson's
notion
about
the
use
of
contempt
in
his
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
postpone
it
if
you
want
to
for
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
let
me
divert
you
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
shouldn't
you
add,
mr.
spritzer
that
there
is
no
longer
inherent
power
in
the
federal
courts
to
punish
for
contempt.
congress
has
seen
fit
to
define
and
to
limit,
there
was
in
the
(inaudible)
and
what
is
now.
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
--
there's
no
federal
judge
can
now
punish
as
an
exercise
of
inherent
power.
he
must
bring
himself
within
the
terms
or
limitations
of
the
contempt
statute.
