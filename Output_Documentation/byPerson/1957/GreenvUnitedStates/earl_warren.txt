mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
--
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt,
was
it
on
this
--
this
ground
that
you're
talking
about
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
that
establish
mr.
spritzer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
it
just
say
you
can
do
either?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
does
it
go
--
how
does
it
go
further?
that's
what
i
like
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
to
what
extent
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
it
gives
him
discretion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
he
--
suppose
he
made
it
nine
years
instead
of
three
here,
what
standard
would
--
would
we
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
be
the
limited
discretion,
a
cruel
inhuman
punishment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
even
--
even
taking
your
--
your
interpretation
of
the
words
"at
its
discretion"
to
the
effect
that
that
means
the
quantum
of
the
punishment,
there
is
nothing
in
that
language
that
would
indicate
they
--
they
intended
to
make
it
a
felony
rather
than
a
misdemeanor
or
to
permit
the
judge
to
give
felonious
punishment
as
distinguished
for
misdemeanor
punishment,
is
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
spritzer,
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
if
there
are
any
--
any
limits
that
--
on
the
contempt
power
that
have
been
established
or
can
be
established,
you
say
it
all
depends
upon
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
how
in
a
courtroom,
if
--
if
a
person
creates
a
mild
disturbance,
it
--
he
probably
get
a
small
fine
or
maybe
there
so
in
jail.
suppose
during
the
course
of
a
trial,
he
killed
a
man
in
the
courtroom,
would
the
judge
send
him
to
jail
for
life
for
contempt
because
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
that
he
committed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
--
how
long
could
he
send
him
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
--
as
i
understood
you,
if
these
--
if
these
two
men
conspired
to
do
what
they
have
done
and
the
--
and
the
evidence
here
all
shows
that
whatever
they
did,
they
conspired
to
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
they
would
only
be
guilty
of
--
of
a
year.
you
said
they
could
have
been
charged
with
conspiracy,
we're
doing
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
--
but
i
understood
you
to
say
also
that
if
they
had
agreed
to
do
it,
that
it
would
have
been
a
criminal
conspiracy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
what
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
the
limit
of
a
conspiracy
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
three
years
--
it
isn't
three
years
as
much
as
this
one,
this
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
were
--
i
just
thought
you
were
reading
their
statements
and
saying,
"we
did
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
do
that,"
and
so
forth.
and
i
thought
maybe
that
--
well,
that's
--
that's
beside
the
point,
i
believe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
oh,
pardon
me.
go
right
ahead.
go
right
ahead
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
spritzer.
mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
your
--
you
may
have
your
eight
minutes,
if
you
wish.
