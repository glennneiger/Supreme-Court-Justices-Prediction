what
--
what
was
--
in
this
--
what
is
matter
of
record
mr.
culver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
--
there
were
some
remarks
of
the
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
the
doctor
but
the
judge
himself
has
presumptions
that
he
put
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
was
contemporaneous
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
come
--
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
wasn't
it
--
wasn't
it
contemporaneous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
what
else
--
that's
the
same
or
whatever
it
was.
the
next
evidence
whatever
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
years
after
reconstruction,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
matter
of
record,
was
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
didn't
have
it
in
--
in
the
--
what
do
you
call
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
de
meerleer
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
de
meerleer.
we
didn't
have
that
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
--
would
you
take
two
minutes
to
read
it
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there's
some
importance
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what's
the
record
of
the
witness
who
was
identified
as
the
father
of
brown
--
of
moore,
i
beg
your
pardon,
who
was
identified
as
a
father
of
moore
and
he
urged
moore
not
to
plead
or
indicated
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
was
that
the
record
of
that
made
at
that
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
when
this
--
when
--
was
it
judge
weimer
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
who
did
this
that
before
he
sentenced
him
that
when
he
was
pleading
guilty,
there
was
a
voice,
spectator
in
the
court
who
was
after
identified
as
the
father.
did
i
get
it
all
wrong?
is
this
imagining
under
my
part?
it
must
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
waste
your
time.
i'll
find
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
statute
now
required
that,
doesn't
it
mr.
culver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
go
on
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
we
have
is
ms.
zeedyke
exactly
--
the
witnesses
for
determining
what
sentence
to
impose,
that
was
put
on
record
as
you
call
it
being
an
--
a
stenographer
took
it
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
transcribed
and
it's
now
on
file
in
the
kalamazoo
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
culver,
before
you
sit
down.
what
lead
you
to
say
that
the
sheriff
told
willie
moore
that
he
couldn't
(inaudible)
i
thought
i
read
in
the
(inaudible)
just
the
opposite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
tell
willie
moore
that
he
couldn't
protect
him
or
words
with
that
effect
(inaudible).
you
didn't
tell
him
that?
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
willie
moore
said
11
years
later
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
what
he
thinks
the
sheriff
said,
nothing
is
more
to
him
than
people
asking
why
--
beginning
to
think
things
we've
said
and
weren't
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
most
common
plaything
in
--
on
the
part
of
a
perfectly
honest
people.
