mr.
samuel
j.
torina
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
justice
warren.
i
regret
to
announce
that
mr.
shepherd,
my
predecessor
retired
this
june,
after
many
long
years
before
this
court.
he
was
paying
many
tributes
when
he
retired.
but
i
think
the
one
that
he
cherished
most
was
the
one
that
you
paid
him
last
year
in
the
butler
case
where
you
expressed
your
appreciation
of
his
candor
before
this
court.
i
hope
that
when
i
retire,
and
i
will
have
earned
the
same
accolade
from
this
court
because
i
really
feel
that
these
quick
justice
cases
are
the
kind
that
disturbed
everybody.
you
have
a
young
man
here,
17
years
old.
he
pleads
guilty
to
under
a
very
serious
crime.
he's
not
represented
by
an
attorney.
i
started
to
say
without
benefit
of
attorney
but
that's
my
view
upon
waiting.
but
anyhow,
he's
not
represented
by
an
attorney.
and
it
causes
all
of
us
a
lot
of
concern.
i
was
concerned
about
it
when
i
got
the
record.
and
i
started
very
carefully.
i
even
went
to
kalamazoo
to
look
at
the
jail
and
i
included
the
picture
of
the
jail
here
for
that
reason.
i
wanted
you
to
see
what
type
of
jail
this
man
was
confined
in
by
the
time
he
entered
his
plea.
and
if
you
will
notice,
it's
a
rather
massive
pile
of
brick
and
marble.
it
was
built
in
1937
on
wpa
funds
partly
and
is
used
as
a
federal
jail
also.
and
the
cells,
the
solitary
cell
which
is
referred
here
is
not
a
solitary
cell
alone.
it's
solitary
in
the
sense
that
it's
all
to
this
side
but
there
is
a
door,
an
iron
door
that
leads
to
it.
and
then
there
is
another
door
outside
that's
made
of
iron.
and
when
i
saw
this
cell,
it
was
brightly
lit
up,
you
could
see
into
it
and
there
was
an
intoxicated
man
who
had
been
confined
there.
that's
the
kind
of
a
cell
that
is.
so
when
they
speak
about
solitary
cell
here,
they
don't
--
it
doesn't
mean
solitary
in
the
sense
of
putting
some
man
down
the
hole.
i
also
talked
with
judge
fox.
i
want
to
make
sure
that
when
he
took
the
statement
from
moore
in
this
case,
i
want
to
see
what
type
of
a
man
he
was.
well,
he's
an
able
and
respected
judge
there
in
kalamazoo.
he
was
the
assistant
prosecutor
who
took
the
statement
--
the
statement
here.
and
i
asked
him
when
he
took
the
statement
just
what
he
thought
on
willie
moore's
condition.
and
he
said
he
thought
the
plea
was
free
and
voluntarily.
he
had
no
worries
about
it.
he
was
still
convinced
of
that.
i
talked
to
mr.
(inaudible)
who
is
still
down
there
and
to
several
other
people.
well,
after
i
saw
that,
i
decided
that
we
would
oppose
this
motion
and
do
the
best
we
can
here.
now,
i'm
glad
of
one
thing.
we
will
not
have,
i
hope
any
more
of
willie
moore
case
in
michigan.
we
have
revised
our
court
rules
and
our
statutes
since
that
time.
under
the
de
meerleer
case
within
a
month
later,
we
revised
our
proceedings
there,
our
court
rules
which
hand
of
course
substantial
in
our
state.
and
that
provided
that
when
a
man
pleads
guilty
or
offers
to
plead
guilty,
the
court
before
accepting
the
plea
has
to
advise
him
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
right
to
a
jury
trial.
and
then
if
--
if
the
man
advised
the
court,
he
is
unable
to
afford
counsel
then
the
court
will
appoint
one.
we've
even
gone
so
far
now
and
i
think
further
in
most
states,
we've
tried
to
find
the
suggestions
made
by
this
court.
we
allow
a
man
to
request
an
attorney
at
a
preliminary
examination
now.
i
know
that
statute
was
just
passed
three
months
ago.
i've
had
a
little
trouble
interpreting
who
the
presiding
judge
would
appoint.
i
have
to
interpret
that
but
there
is
no
question
now
if
a
man
comes
at
a
preliminary
examination
in
our
state
and
request
an
attorney
it
will
--
he
will
be
appointed
one.
so
we
will
not
handle
that
state.
we
--
our
state
does
not
believe
in
depriving
anybody
of
his
rights.
i've
been
through
the
--
this
procedure
under
rule
of
35-a
many
times
in
my
job
as
an
assistant
prosecutor
in
wayne
county.
i
know
the
exact
procedure
when
the
man
said
he
wants
to
plead
guilty,
the
judge
stops
the
proceeding
and
says,
"do
you
want
an
attorney
to
represent
you?"
and
if
he
said,
"yes."
and
he
appoints
an
attorney
for
him.
and
the
record
is
made
of
a
whole
proceeding.
if
a
man
pleads
guilty,
he's
asked
to
plead
guilty
freely
and
voluntarily,
he's
asked
if
he's
guilty.
he's
pleading
guilty
because
he
is
guilty.
he's
asked
of
any
threats
or
violence
has
been
used
on
him.
so
we
don't
have
that
situation
anymore.
thank
the
lord.
and
i
hope
we'll
never
have
another
one
like
this
one.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
but
--
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
all
right,
your
honor.
tomorrow
morning.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
when
the
adjournment
is
called
up,
i
was
discussing
the
question
of
procedure
in
michigan
involved
in
this
case.
i
think
i'll
continue
on
because
i
think
that
the
proceedings
that
were
involved
in
this
case
are
very
important
to
its
determination.
now,
i
would
like
to
profess
my
argument
by
pointing
out
that
these
proceedings
have
been
before
this
court
prior
to
this
time.
they
were
considered
in
the
quicksall
versus
michigan
case
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
the
opinion
on
and
approved
or
i
would
like
to
review
them
again.
now,
willie
b.
moore
was
arraigned
on
information.
it
wasn't
a
complicated
information.
it
was
count
in
simple
language
that
run
in
substance
as
follows.
now,
willie
b.
moore
heretofore
to
wit
on
or
about
the
26th
day
of
october
1938
at
the
city
of
kalamazoo
in
the
county
of
kalamazoo
aforesaid
murdered
josie
zeedyke.
and
then
after
that
the
court
--
the
court
reporter's
transcript
shows
that
the
accused
was
arraigned
and
pleaded
guilty
in
the
official
general
entry
which
appears
here.
now,
this
arraignment
was
on
the
29th
day
of
october
in
1938,
and
the
general
entry
under
our
law
raised
the
strong
presumptions
and
it
discloses
that
following
the
plea
--
but
before
imposing
sentence,
the
trial
judge
took
two
important
procedural
steps
in
accordance
with
our
state
law.
now,
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
rule
35-a
didn't
exist.
we
did
have
a
statute
which
still
exist,
which
provided
that
on
the
plea
of
guilty,
the
judge
was
to
discover
from
the
witness
whether
he
pleaded
guilty
voluntarily
or
not.
there
wasn't
any
procedure
outlined
by
which
that
discovery
was
to
be
made
and
several
has
been
used
throughout
the
state
and
approved
by
our
court.
on
this
case,
according
to
a
witness,
the
colloquy
took
place
between
willie
b.
moore
and
the
judge
for
about
15
minutes.
this
witness
was
running
sure
who
was
an
attorney
spectator
in
the
court
at
the
time
this
arraignment
took
place,
he
said
it
was
about
9
o'clock
in
the
morning.
well
anyhow,
after
this
colloquy,
the
judge
took
willie
moore
into
his
chambers
and
willie
moore
says
that
at
the
time
he
was
accompanied
by
sheriff
rubel
(ph).
however,
rubel
(ph)
denied
that
he
went
into
the
chambers
with
the
judge
and
the
judge
then,
according
to
this
record,
which
has
been
put
on
file,
he
made
a
statement
of
the
proceedings
first.
now
he
put
on
file.
he
discussed
with
willie
b.
moore
his
--
his
education,
his
background
and
then
he
says
willie
moore
gave
him
all
the
details
of
the
crime.
and
when
he
came
out,
he
put
that
on
the
record.
had
the
description
of
the
crime
as
given
by
willie
moore
and
then
he
ended
up
with
this
statement
that
appears
on
page
15
of
the
record.
“in
my
private
interview
with
respondent,
i
assured
him
that
he
must
not
plead
guilty
unless
he
really
is
guilty,
that
he
was
not
required
to
plead
guilty,
that
he
could
have
a
trial
by
jury
if
he
desired
it.
he
assured
me
freely
and
voluntarily
that
he
is
guilty
and
that
his
one
desire
is
to
have
it
all
over
to
get
to
the
institution
to
which
he
is
committed
and
to
be
under
observation
and
to
be
examined.
now,
that
was
put
on
the
day
of
the
arraignment.
that
was
put
on
record
and
appeared
in
the
official
court
records.
that
was
the
statement
he
made.
following
that,
the
judge
then
took
a
second
statutory
statement.
our
statute
still
requires
that
upon
a
plea
of
guilty
in
the
case
of
murder,
the
judge
has
to
put
witnesses
on
the
stand
to
determine
the
degree
of
guilt.
if
that
isn't
done,
our
court
has
--
and
that
hasn't
been
done
in
a
couple
of
case
and
each
time
our
court
has
avoided
this
--
the
sentence.
well,
the
judge
then
had
i
think
three
--
three
witnesses
were
put
on
the
stand.
one
was
the
daughter
of
the
deceased
or
the
--
of
the
murdered
woman,
(inaudible)
zeedyke
and
she
testified
that
she
saw
willie
moore
come
to
the
house
on
the
day
he
asked
her
if
they
had
any
work
to
do.
she
knew
him.
she
had
met
him
previously
to
this
time
because
willie
moore
had
worked
for
her
brother.
and
after
that,
she
said
she
saw
him
(inaudible)
she
found
her
mother.
another
witness
was
a
policeman
who
is
called
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
and
he
testified
as
to
the
condition
of
the
woman
and
then
the
coroner
testified.
the
coroner
or
the
doctor
as
to
the
condition
of
the
woman,
what
caused
her
death
and
so
on
and
while
i
think
of
--
there
was
a
police.
i
--
i
don't
recall
exactly.
it's
in
the
transcript.
there
are
three
or
four
witnesses.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
it
was
taken
after.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
well,
i'm
confused,
your
honor,
you're
right.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
it
was
taken
before.
he
had
discussed
the
matter
when
he
first
--
before
he
took
the
statement
of
the
witnesses.
he
discussed
the
plea
of
guilty
and
so
on
and
the
statement
says
that.
the
--
and
then
after
he
took
that,
he
described
the
details
of
the
crime
that
he
got
from
the
defendant
then
he
makes
a
statement
about
the
plaintiff
being
free
and
voluntary.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
and
then
after
that
(voice
overlap).
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
then
after
that,
he
then
went
in
--
got
the
witnesses
and
went
into
the
details
to
determine
the
degree
of
the
murder
and
he
put
another
sentence
--
statement
on
the
file
after
he
sentenced
the
man
to
determine
the
degree
of
guilt
and
it
--
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes.
to
determine
the
degree
of
guilt,
so
he
can
arrive
at
the
sentence.
that's
right,
your
honor.
let's
go
down
incidentally.
but
today,
the
whole
proceeding,
the
discussion
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant
is
put
on
record,
the
proceedings
surrounding
the
plea
of
guilty
and
our
court
rule
provides
for
that.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
that's
right,
your
honor
and
it
was
taken
the
same
day
that
he
pleaded
guilty.
the
court
then
put
another
statement
on
record
regarding
the
sentence
that
he
had
determined
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
after
this
interview
with
these
witnesses
and
he
say
--
he
ended
up
saying
he
thought
he
should
be
sentenced
to
first
degree
to
life
because
under
our
statutory,
it's
mandatory.
and
then,
he
--
he
said
there
in
making
that
statement
--
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
we
don't
have
--
we
never
had
any
death
penalty.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
the
only
death
in
our
state
was
under
a
federal
statute
of
a
robbery
(inaudible).
that's
the
only
death
penalty.
we
have
never
had
any
in
michigan.
it's
not
a
capital
offense.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
not
at
that
time,
your
honor.
that
came
under
35-a.
however,
the
courts
did
appoint
counsel.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
there
was
appointment
of
counsel,
but
none
in
a
situation
like
this
in
a
plea
of
guilty.
it
wasn't
required,
today
it
is.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
in
every
criminal
case
--
pardon?
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
even
misdemeanor
cases
under
that
statute.
i
quoted
yesterday
that
we
just
adopted
and
that's
always
been
the
case.
any
misdemeanor
case
can
have
an
attorney
appointed
by
the
court
from
the
arraignment.
the
prelim
--
preliminary
examination
in
which
it's
not
a
criminal
proceeding
ipso
facto,
it
then
become
such
until
it's
bound
--
he's
bound
over
the
circuit
court.
but
we
have
gone
even
further
to
protect
the
defendants
now
and
we
allow
--
allowed
that
testimony
to
be
--
an
attorney
be
pointed
on
the
examination
so
from
every
step,
he
has
an
attorney.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
well,
i
was
going
to
point
out.
i
know
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
about
that
yesterday,
in
regard
to
a
delay
in
motion
for
a
new
trial.
now,
our
leading
case
on
that
is
people
against
(inaudible)
and
that
case
is
218
mich
and
which
must
be
at
least
30
years
old,
but
our
court
--
we
haven't
got
any
court
rule
on
it.
our
courts
have
always
used
that
as
part
of
their
inherent
power
to
correct
any
injustice.
so,
it's
been
in
michigan
from
the
very
first
as
far
as
i
can
determine.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
and
it's
a
very
informal
proceeding.
he
files
a
motion
for
a
delay
--
leave
to
file
a
delay
in
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
that
he's
got
to
set
up
his
reasoning
grounds
and
justify
his
delay
beyond
excuse.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
oh,
yes.
there's
always
been
one
in
michigan.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
and
here,
willie
moore
did
have
the
opportunity
to
file
such
a
motion,
but
he
waited
almost
12
years
before
doing
so
and
i
say
that
--
that
procedure
is
very
informal,
our
courts
and
magistrate
(inaudible).
in
fact,
we're
getting
now
--
we're
--
we're
going
to
pass
a
statute
soon
which
makes
all
criminal
cases
appealable
in
that
state.
we
don't
have
the
right
now.
you
have
the
right
to
file
an
implication
to
lead
to
appeal.
but
we
also
have
another
proceeding
and
that's
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
delay
--
a
delayed
application
for
leave
to
appeal
and
that
can
be
filed
anytime
and
that's
a
very
informal
proceeding.
the
record
is
settled
and
then
the
court
can
--
can
open
up
the
whole
case
and
that's
what
was
done
here
after
12
years
and
that's
why
willie
moore
got
into
our
supreme
court.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
here
that
after
the
hearing
on
this
delayed
motion
for
a
new
trial,
our
court
in
kalamazoo
appointed
an
attorney
for
him.
they
paid
--
the
county
paid
--
and
they
paid
for
the
record
in
before
your
griffin
against
illinois
case,
we
furnished
the
transcript
for
the
defendants
here
and
paid
for
it.
so,
our
--
our
state
has
been
over
backwards,
i
think,
in
trying
to
give
willie
moore
due
process
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
well,
as
i
see
it
here,
the
first
motion
he
made
was
september
1949
and
he
got
an
attorney
of
his
own
choice,
mr.
roxboro
who
is
a
very
able
and
experienced
attorney.
he's
colored
and
he
has
handled
a
great
number
of
these
cases
and
i'd
like
to
say
here
now
that
i'm
surprised
that
when
they
first
filed
this
delayed
motion
for
a
new
trial,
there
was
nothing
said
about
duress.
the
only
thing
they
went
upon
was
the
de
meerleer
case
which
he
mentioned
here
yesterday
and
that
was
grounded
on
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel,
failure
to
inform
him
on
the
consequences
of
his
plea
and
--
and
the
fact
that
he
was
rushed
into
a
hearing
without
experience
and
it
was
frankly
verbatim
de
meerleer
but
after
they
had
the
hearing
under
the
delayed
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
followed
this
hearing,
part
of
it,
then
they
sheriff
struble
made
a
remark
about
the
tension
on
that
that
time
and
then
he
brought
that
in
and
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to
where
that
happened.
on
page
9,
the
grounds
of
the
delayed
motion
for
a
new
trial
are
sent
out
in
my
brief
and
they're
verbatim
from
de
meerleer.
and
then,
on
--
on
page
23
at
the
delay
hearing
on
the
delayed
motion
for
a
new
trial,
after
sheriff
struble
testified,
willie
moore
testified,
mr.
roxboro
advised
the
court
as
follows.
no,
excuse
me.
before
he
--
before
the
proceeding
started,
and
mr.
roxboro
informed
the
court
as
follows.
“so,
there
won't
be
any
misunderstandings.
we
aren't
relying
on
any
general
allegation.
we
are
relying
on
just
two
things,
on
this
record
and
on
the
de
meerleer
case.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
at
the
time
willie
b.
moore
--
and
at
that
time,
willie
b.
moore
was
17
years
of
age.”
i
don't
--
i've
better
put
on
my
glasses.
the
extent
of
his
education
then
was
at
seventh-grade
education
and
it
is
our
contention
that
he
did
not
have
a
fair
trial
and
that
contention
is
substantiated
by
the
case
of
de
meerleer
versus
the
people
on
the
state
of
michigan
and
then
he
quoted
--
cites
it
then.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
case
is
directly
in
point
and
fits
on
all
four
the
case
before
the
bar
at
that
time
and
then
the
assistant
prosecutor
who
was
conducting
the
examination
said,
so
there
won't
be
any
mistakes,
i
want
this
to
be
down
if
that's
what
they're
going
on,
but
then
after
rubel
(ph)
testified
and
willie
moore
testified,
they
asked
to
amend
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
include
duress
and
so
on.
the
--
and
the
court
allowed
them
and
continued
the
hearing
and
they
brought
in
more
witnesses
and
the
people
brought
in
more
witnesses.
now,
there
was
something
said
here
about
the
promise
of
leniency
made
by
mr.
chapman.
the
record
shows
that
willie
moore
said
that
mr.
(inaudible),
the
prosecutor
promised
him
leniency
and
that
this
was
okayed
by
chapman.
now,
we
--
the
people
weren't
able
to
refute
that
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
mr.
(inaudible)
is
paralytic
now.
he
can't
speak
and
the
record
shows
that.
he's
an
old
man
and
he's
just
--
and
that
--
and
that
he's
suffering
from
incapacity
and
chapman
is
in
florida
and
he
weren't
--
they
weren't
able
to
get
him
and
that's
why
that
wasn't
refuted.
but
anyhow,
after
that
happened,
the
judge
heard
all
the
witnesses,
both
pro
and
con
and
the
--
all
the
testimony
regarding
the
fact
that
there
was
duress
and
so
on,
appeared
to
willie
moore.
the
only
other
testimony
regarding
the
tension
in
the
community
came
from
sheriff
struble
who
said
that
the
--
there
was
a
lot
of
tension
at
that
time
and
he
told
them
that
he
pleaded
guilty
if
he
were
guilty
ought
to
plead
guilty,
but
he
said
also
that
he
told
him
that
if
he
weren't
guilty,
he'd
stand
firm
and
protect
you.
that's
what
he
said
and
that's
what
they're
relying
on
chiefly
in
his
brief.
there
are
other
witnesses
who
took
the
stand
afterwards.
who
said
screw
hummel
and
two
or
three
other
officers
took
the
stand
and
said
there
wasn't
any
tension
in
the
community,
it
was
a
usual
thing
when
you
got
a
murder
of
this
kind.
people
were
talking
about
it
in
the
record.
there
was
also
--
willie
moore
said
that
he
was
worried
because
people
banged
on
his
doors.
he
was
in
a
solitary
cell.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
--
took
him
by
the
(inaudible)
yes.
they
took
him
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes,
your
honor.
he
did.
you
see,
they
took
him
to
jackson
prison
on
the
same
day.
there
are
two
routes
and
i
got
it
from
this
record.
i'm
not
a
kalamazoo
resident,
but
he
said
that
he
heard
there
was
going
to
be
some
trouble.
and
on
a
part
of
a
group
of
colored
fellows,
they're
going
to
take
willie
moore
away
and
then
there
was
another
group
of
holland
fellows,
they
were
going
to
interfere,
so
he
said
he
took
the
back
roads
avoiding
any
trouble.
i
think
he
acted
like
any
good
law
enforcement
officer
would
in
a
situation
of
this
kind.
but
i
say
that
in
regard
to
the
tension
that
was
disputed
by
other
witnesses,
the
only
--
judge
fox
who
was
the
assistant
prosecutor
at
that
time
that
he
wasn't
aware
of
any
tension.
i
tried
to
describe
to
you
yesterday
the
jail
that
was
involved
and
as
you
noticed,
it
is
quite
a
structure.
now,
the
top
of
that
jail,
they
went
as
only
up
to
the
fourth
floor.
the
top
there
shows
a
cement
wall
if
you
look
at
the
appendix.
now,
that
wall
surrounds
--
the
fifth
floor
is
sort
of
a
penthouse
and
the
jail
itself
is
back
from
the
edge
of
the
building,
about
four
feet
and
then
there
are
windows
for
look
out.
but
in
further,
those
windows
appeared
in
this
cement
wall
which
goes
six
or
seven
feet
up
above
the
jail
and
the
jail
itself
is
about
60
feet
to
75
feet
high.
now,
the
only
entrance
to
these
cells
are
first,
the
elevator,
which
has
been
described
and
that's
used
only
for
prisoners
and
it's
a
very
small
elevator.
i
think
it's
about
twice
as
wide
as
this
stand
and
it
has
a
lock
in
the
basement
and
it's
unlocked
when
prisoners
are
taken
into
jail
by
the
sheriff.
then,
it
doesn't
stop
the
first
floor.
it
stops
at
the
second
floor
where
the
court
is
and
it
stops
at
the
fifth
floor
where
the
jail
is.
i
don't
think
he
can
get
over
five
or
six
people
in
that
--
in
that
elevator.
and
then,
there's
a
stairway
to
right
of
there.
it's
a
very
narrow
stairway
and
the
door
leads
into
the
outer
room
in
the
jail
where
the
prisoners
are
booked.
it's
a
very
narrow
stairway
as
i'd
say
and
the
door
is
made
up
of
cement
--
of
steel.
and
then,
there's
another
stairway
that
goes
into
the
part
where
the
judge
lived
at
that
time.as
the
record
says,
the
judge
had
an
apartment
in
the
jail
himself
and
that
was
up
towards
the
front.
now,
that
door
has
a
very
--
that
stairway
is
also
narrow
and
it
has
a
steel
door
and
it
only
opens
from
the
inside.
it
can't
be
open
from
the
outside
and
then
there's
another
iron
door
that
blocks
off
any
entrance
into
the
--
the
main
room
here,
so
you
can
see
the
situation
at
this
time.
i
don't
believe
willie
moore,
when
he
says
there
were
people
there,
they
couldn't
because
there's
an
outer
office,
it's
a
very
small
one
and
then
there's
another
steel
door
that
leads
into
where
the
cell
is
which
is
on
the
right
and
that
--
and
left
to
that
is
the
kitchen
and
they
had
a
very
cook
there
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
pleasant
(inaudible)
better
than
some
hotel
i've
been
in.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
yes
and
struble
and
a
couple
of
other
said
that
there
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
he's
the
sheriff
at
that
time.
hummel
said
it
and
a
couple
of
other
people.
and
incidentally,
struble
said
that
they
used
to
have
crowd
there
but
they
were
church
groups
(inaudible)
and
this
cell
as
i
say
isn't
really
solitary,
there
are
two
--
two
bunks
in
it
and
they
had
a
good
will
drunken
at
the
day
i
was
there
and
it's
used
as
a
federal
prison
too,
so
that's
the
situation.
and
everything
that
willie
moore
contended
here
came
out
of
the
hearing
that
day
and
he's
complaining
about
that
hearing
now
in
saying,
“we
can't
use
that
reconstructing
testimony,”
but
i
don't
think
that's
fair.
to
use
a
testimony
to
support
his
side
of
the
argument
and
then
try
to
prevent
us
from
doing
--
doing
it.
i
don't
know
how
you
remember
a
famous
two-handed
archer
in
mythology.
he's
going
to
act
on
his
right
hand
and
if
he
missed
it,
he
then
changed
it
and
shot
you
with
left
hand.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what's
happening
to
us
here.
anyhow,
i
believe
that
our
brief
shows
that
all
of
these
contentions
have
been
denied.
three
courts
have
passed
on
it,
the
trial
court
before
whom
appears,
he
appeared
to
have
a
chance
to
observe
misdemeanor
and
he
came
into
conclusion,
no
compulsion
were
used.
then,
he
had
the
judge
on
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
he
said
he
didn't
believe
willie
moore.
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
i
--
i
didn't
know
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
j.
torina
the
1948
and
he
died
just
after
the
quicksall
case
which
he
passed
on.
he
was
the
same
judge
incidentally
in
that
case.
what
i
know
of,
i
mean
he's
a
very
kind
gentleman
and
was
most
meticulous
in
his
cases.
his
statement
not
stereotype.
it
goes
into
details
and
then
after
judge
sweet
passed
on
it,
our
supreme
court
passed
on
it
and
they
decided
it
on
the
question
of
facts,
the
credibility
of
willie
moore
and
i
think
that
is
the
whole
issue
here.
whom
are
you
going
to
believe,
willie
moore
now
after
waiting
all
this
time?
or
you're
going
to
believe
the
court
which
had
a
chance
to
observe
misdemeanor?
i
think
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case,
our
state
has
done
everything
possible
to
provide
due
process
for
willie
moore
and
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
i
think
the
court
--
if
there
are
any
questions,
i'd
be
glad
to
answer
them
but
i'd
appreciate
your
attention
and
your
time.
