mr.
william
h.
culver
if
the
court
please.
this
is
the
case
of
willie
b.
moore
who
was
sentenced
on
october
29th,
1938
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
county
of
kalamazoo,
michigan
and
the
sentence
was
on
--
after
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge
of
murder
of
a
lady
named
josie
zeedyke.
mr.
moore,
in
the
1940s,
filed
his
own
papers
with
the
circuit
court
for
the
county
of
kalamazoo.
sometime
later,
he
was
represented
in
escort
in
three
separate
hearings
on
a
delayed
motion
for
a
new
trial.
after
that,
mr.
moore
was
out
of
money.his
father
is
a
blind
man.
his
mother
is
sick.
the
circuit
court
appointed
me
as
the
attorney
for
mr.
moore
to
attempt
the
perfected
field
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan.
subsequently,
the
supreme
court
denied
--
the
delayed
motion
denied
the
--
granted
the
appeal
but
denied
the
delayed
motion
for
the
new
trial
in
a
5-to-3
decision.
and
subsequently,
this
court
has
appointed
me
to
represent
him
at
this
time.
now,
in
arguing
this
case
and
looking
into
this
case,
we
have
one
barrier
which
is
difficult
to
overcome.
that
is
before
the
de
meerleer
case
in
our
circuit
in
kalamazoo.
there
was
no
court
reporter
of
any
of
the
questioning
or
of
any
of
the
procedure
that
went
on
at
the
time
of
the
--
what
we
call
the
arraignment,
in
finding
out
whether
the
man
needed
counsel,
whether
he
could
afford
counsel.
and
i
think
that's
been
--
i
haven't
found
that
that
is
in
question
by
the
court
at
any
time
but
i
wish
it's
pointed
out
to
the
court
since
i
submit
that
that
makes
the
rate
of
the
problem
as
to
equality
of
the
evidence
which
is
brought
before
this
court.
the
evidence
as
to
what
happened
at
the
arraignment
is
simply
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
or
four
casual
witnesses
and
mr.
(inaudible)
the
lawyer
who
just
happened
to
be
in
the
court
and
mr.
zeedyke,
son
of
the
murdered
lady.
and
it
raises
a
difficult
problem
on
appeal
which
would
never
have
occurred
at
this
time.
mr.
william
h.
culver
it's
no
longer
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
it's
no
longer
the
rule
in
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
there
was
nothing
peculiar
about
this
particular
one.
however
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
as
far
as
the
arraignment
is
concerned,
it
just
says
arraignment
and
plea.
mr.
william
h.
culver
and
subsequently,
in
the
term
--
after
the
plea,
in
the
determination
of
the
decree
where
there
was
first,
second,
third
manslaughter
there
were
questions
of
the
doctor
who
have
attended
to
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes.
mr.
william
h.
culver
there
are
subsequent
statements
by
the
judge
that
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
it
was.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
culver
subsequent
to
the
plea.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes.
mr.
william
h.
culver
no.
mr.
william
h.
culver
that
was
--
in
the
--
it
--
in
that
statement
which
is
the
standard
form
of
--
we
followed
in
our
--
we
followed
in
our
county.
however,
subsequent
evidence
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
de
meerleer.
mr.
william
h.
culver
i
don't
believe
so.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
he
said
that
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
plea
was
freely
and
voluntarily
made.
and
he
also
discussed
the
fact
that
this
man
has
voluntarily
or
had
--
had
confessed
the
crime,
this
horrible
crime
which
had
been
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
sir?
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
culver
after
the
plea
and
the
--
at
the
time
of
defense.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
the
judge
said,
"in
my
private
interview
with
respondent,
i
assured
him
that
he
must
not
plead
guilty
unless
he
really
is
guilty;
that
he
was
not
required
to
plead
guilty;
that
he
could
have
a
trial
by
jury
if
he
desired
it.
he
assured
me
freely
and
voluntarily
that
he
is
guilty
and
that
his
one
desire
is
to
have
it
all
over,
to
get
to
the
institution
to
which
he
is
to
be
committed,
and
to
be
under
observation
and
to
be
examined.”
that's
on
page
15
of
the
transcript
of
records.
mr.
william
h.
culver
no.
there
was
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
that,
if
--
if
i
understand,
mr.
justice,
correctly,
that
was
a
record
attempt
to
get
into
the
record
of
prior
conviction
of
mr.
moore.
mr.
moore's
father
was
not
involved
here
at
all.
he
was
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
he
lost
contact
of
his
parents
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
culver
judge
weimer.
mr.
william
h.
culver
i
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
the
only
time
he
did
contact
his
parents
was
the
half
hour
after
he
was
sentenced
and
before
he
went
to
jackson
prison.
but
there's
no
--
he
didn't
at
any
time
speak
with
his
parents.
they
may
have
been
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
william
h.
culver
in
attempting
to
break
this
down
in
a
nice
category
to
defies
that
sort
of
thing
but
we
think
that
substantially
it
shows
--
the
record
shows
that
the
plea
of
guilty
was
gained
by
duress
and
coercion
and
that
there
was
a
failure
to
provide
counsel
in
this
particular
case
which
should
have
been
provided.
and
what
shows
the
duress
and
coercion,
first
all,
mr.
moore
at
the
time
of
--
of
his
plea,
was
17
years
old.
he
was
a
colored
man.
he's
been
in
michigan
about
10
years.
he
had
a
seventh-grade
education.
he
was
--
and
this
is
undisputed.
he
was
arrested
on
the
afternoon
of
october
26,
wednesday
afternoon.
he
was
questioned
until
about
2
to
3
o'clock
the
next
morning.
questioned
on
the
next
day
until
about
8
or
9
at
night,
he
was
questioned
until
approximately
11
at
night.
he
was
questioned
the
next
day
and
questioned
there
would
be
friday
until
the
afternoon.
mr.
william
h.
culver
none,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
culver
now,
in
my
brief
i've
stated
that
under
mcnabb,
this
might
--
this
would
come
under
the
--
the
due
process
clause
on
the
limitation
of
federal
rights.
and
i
know
that
the
court
has
not
so
held.
but
i
submit
that
in
this
particular
case,
in
view
of
the
other
facts
involved
that
it
--
it
does
raise
along
with
the
other
facts,
a
due
process
problem,
and
that
is
questioning
the
arraignment
that
is
the
original
examination
by
mr.
moore
occurred
after
he
had
been
questioned
for
approximately
three
days
and
our
statute
provides
that
most
statutes
do
that
you
take
the
man
before
the
nearest
convenient
examining
magistrate
as
soon
as
you
can
do
it.
in
this
case,
he
was
not
taken
before
the
magistrate.and
he
was
a
young
man
and
fully
educated
and
a
literate.
now,
what
happened
during
this
questioning?
here
it
seems
to
me
is
the
important
point.
there
is
on
the
record
the
statement
by
the
judge
that
he
was
satisfied
that
the
plea
was
freely
and
involuntarily
made
and
we
don't
question
that
the
judge
said
that.
but
at
that
time,
he
didn't
know
what
had
happened.
and
we
didn't
know
what
had
happened
until
at
1950
or
1951
when
sheriff
struble
who
was
the
sheriff
at
the
time
of
willie
moore's
arraignment
and
arrest,
when
sheriff
struble
testified
before
the
--
the
circuit
court.
and
when
he
was
asked
what
did
he
say
to
mr.
moore,
to
the
17-year-old
fellow,
he
said,
“it
is
my
duty,
and
it
is
up
to
me
to
protect
you,
to
use
every
effort
at
my
command
to
protect
you,
but,
i
says,
“the
tension
is
high
out
there
and
i
am
just
telling
you
what
could
happen
if
it
was
started
by
someone.”
i
don't
know
the
language
i
used.”
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
“i
don't
know
as
i
come
out
and
said
at
any
time
for
him
to
plead
one
way
or
another,
but
what
i
was
putting
over
to
him
was
the
fact
that
if
you
are
guilty
and
will
be
sent
away,
you
might
better
be
getting
away
before
trouble,
because
i
had
had
information
that
there
were
certain
colored
fellows,
a
group
of
them,
that
was
going
to
interfere
with
me,
and
also
that
there
was
a
bunch
of
holland
fellows
going
to
meet
me
when
i
go
to
jackson,
they
would
meet
me
there
at
galesburg
there,
and,
therefore,
when
he
was
sentenced,
i
avoided
the
main
route
and
went
way
through
by
gull
lake
and
across
over
in
the
hills.”
now
what
you
may
say
yourself
well,
that
wouldn't
seem
to
affect
me.
i
wouldn't
plead
guilty
to
a
crime
just
because
the
sheriff
said
that.
but
we
contend
that
the
effect
on
mr.
moore
was
just
as
he
said.
“after
the
man
tell
me
he
couldn't
protect
me
then
there
was
nothing
--
then
there
wasn't
nothing
i
could
do.
i
was
mostly
scared
than
anything
else.”
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes.
mr.
william
h.
culver
--
before
judge
--
judge
sweet
on
a
delayed
motion.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
sir.
now,
the
delay
was
not
the
delay
and
the
failure
to
have
a
record
was
not
the
failure
of
mr.
moore.
he
was
imprisoned
and
as
i've
indicated
to
you
to
have
counsel,
he
had
to
have
counsel
appointed
by
the
circuit
court
of
county
kalamazoo.
and
during
the
time
of
his
incarceration
in
this
questioning,
he
was
not
allowed
to
permit
his
relatives
or
his
friends
and
he
did
not
in
fact
permit
them
or
--
or
contact
them.
and
that
also
is
undisputed.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
further,
he
was
without
counsel.
and
there
is
some
evidence
in
this
hearing
that
counsel
was
mentioned
to
him
but
it's
undisputed
of
course
that
he
was
without
the
benefit
of
counsel.
he
was
in
an
isolated
cell.
its
--
i
see
now
in
the
brief
first
which
was
furnished
to
me
by
the
people
that
they
have
pictures
of
the
--
the
prison
showing
that
you
couldn't
get
up,
this
particular
spot.
however,
it's
submitted
that
mr.
moore
has
indicated
the
people
that
were
there
were
brought
up
as
visitors
and
that
they
pounded
on
the
cell,
on
his
cell
that
evening
and
they
--
they
threatened
him
and
they
shouted.
and
in
particular,
one
said,
“well,
let's
get
him
now
and
i'll
get
it
over
with.”
and
that
then
is
when
this
hammering
started
on
the
door
up
there.
and
i
submit
that
that
was
occurring
on
until
the
fear
in
mr.
moore
from
the
time
--
right
onto
to
the
time
on
saturday
morning
when
--
when
he
pleaded
guilty
and
he
was
sent
to
prison.
and
further
undisputed
on
the
record,
i
submit
are
the
--
that
the
prosecutor
and
members
of
the
police
promised
him
a
shorter
sentence
if
he
should
plead
guilty.
now,
next,
and
i
think
running
into
the
same
thing
is
and
the
same
facts
are
applicable
was
the
fact
the
counsel
was
not
appointed.
this
is
as
capital
offenses
as
--
as
we
have
in
michigan.
obviously,
we
don't
have
a
death
sentence
but
we
do
have
this
murder
in
the
first
degree
which
is
mandatory
life
and
the
man
goes
to
prison
for
life,
forever,
there
is
no
parole,
no
pardon,
perhaps
there's
pardon
but
there's
no
parole.
so
this
is
a
serious
case.
this
is
as
serious
as
you
can
get.
he
was
17
years
old.
he
had
a
seventh-grade
education.
there's
a
lot
of
evidence,
a
lot
of
testimony
in
the
record
that
try
to
show
that
he
was
an
experienced
criminal
and
where
--
where
the
evidence
came
that
he
had
four
or
five
difficulties
with
the
--
with
the
police,
i
don't
know.
however,
if
--
if
that's
true,
if
that's
what
he
told
the
judge,
then
they
--
they
were
juvenile
offenses
and
they
were
not
record
offenses.
and
the
only
offense
which
is
shown
in
the
record
is
the
offense
some
two
weeks
before
in
grand
rapids
when
he
pleaded
guilty
to
unlawfully
driving
away
a
car.
and
the
evidence
shows
in
that
case
that
the
contact
between
the
police
officer,
mr.
cole
and
--
was
between
him
and
(inaudible)
said
he
was
the
father
of
willie
moore
he
was
mixed
up
by
that.
it
was
between
him
and
the
mother
and
we
just
asked
the
mother,
“do
you
think
you
ought
to
have
a
lawyer
for
him?”
and
--
and
apparently
she
said,
“no.”
mr.
william
h.
culver
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
so
except
for
the
fact
that
the
appointment
by
the
court
of
--
of
counsel,
the
fact
that
the
boy
did
--
didn't
have
any
money.
he
had
no
way
of
--
of
having
counsel,
paying
for
counsel.
and
that
would
be
the
only
reason.however,
as
the
court
has
decided
in
other
cases
a
mere
delay
in
bringing
this
type
of
thing
is
--
is
not
an
important
matter.
and
this
man,
as
i
say,
his
--
his
father
is
blind,
his
mother
is
sick,
he
just
didn't
have
money
to
bring.
and
i
would
like
to
--
to
say
--
go
on
to
one
this
counsel
question.
first
of
all,
is
that
the
--
the
people
say,
“well,
this
isn't
a
complicated
charge.
well,
the
man
--
the
man
was
charged
with
murder.”
in
michigan,
we
have
first
degree
murder,
second
degree
murder,
manslaughter,
you
can't
get
anymore
--
you
can't
use
one
word
and
mean
any
more
things
than
you
can
with
that
particular
word.
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
horrible
crime.
this
was
a
rape
of
a
68-year-old
woman,
there
was
stabbing,
there
was
murder,
and
i
submit
that
in
--
if
this
man
was
brought
before
our
circuit
court
at
this
time,
with
facts
of
that
type,
a
counsel
would
be
appointed
for
him.
and
i
would
like
also
to
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
yes,
sir.
and
subsequent
to
the
de
meerleer
case,
our
court
rules
immediately
ordered
that
the
man
be
notified.
and
our
circuit
judge
has
a
regular
form
which
he
uses
which
informs
the
man,
he
reads
it
often
and
says
“you're
entitled
to
counsel,”
and
all
those
various
things.
all
of
those
things
have
been
changed
since
that
time.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
sir.
under
our
statutes
and
our
rules,
you
--
your
period
for
appeal
can
be
--
or
--
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
can
be
extended
if
you
show
the
court
that
there
are
certain
reasons
why
it
wasn't
done
and
--
and
implicit
in
the
granting
of
this
delayed
motion
by
our
circuit
judge
is
the
fact
that
there
were
reasons.
mr.
william
h.
culver
it's
been
operative
at
least
10
years.
it's
been
operative
as
far
as
the
de
meerleer
case
was
concerned
and
the
quicksall
case,
all
of
which
cases
were
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
culver
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
william
h.
culver
i
believe
it
was.
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
that
if
he
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
he
so
testified.
mr.
william
h.
culver
it
was
not
controverted.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
he
said
that
the
chief
of
police,
mr.
chapman,
promised
him
a
lesser
sentence.
mr.
william
h.
culver
mr.
chapman,
all
i
know,
is
from
what
mr.
sykes
who
was
the
prosecutor
at
the
time
said
mr.
chapman
was
a
judge
and
that
was
living
in
florida
at
the
time
and
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
i
may
--
i
may
have
struble
and
chapman
mixed
up
but
as
i
recall
mr.
sykes,
who
adjourned
the
hearing
so
that
he
could
get
mr.
chapman's
testimony.
and
it
was
not
brought
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
he
was
--
he
didn't
testify.
mr.
chapman
didn't.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
michigan
supreme
court,
in
this
position,
if
you
read
the
decision,
you'll
see
the
first
three
questions
involved.
i
--
i
pray
that
this
court
does
not
decide
the
case
on
those
--
on
that
basis.
first
is,
they
decided
on
whether
or
not
this
man
was
guilty
or
innocent.
i
was
appointed
by
the
court
not
to
determine
a
guilt
or
innocence
of
this
man
and
this
court,
i'm
sure,
is
well
aware
that
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is
where
--
was
he
granted
his
constitutional
rights.
the
second
thing
which
the
supreme
court
said
is
that
it's
difficult
to
get
evidence
to
have
a
trial
after
17
years
have
elapsed.
again,
i
submit
that's
not
relevant.
and
then
finally,
the
--
the
court
says
we're
worried
about
the
possible
consequences
of
returning
to
society,
a
person
likely
to
increase
the
public
burden
of
sex
crimes.
again,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
reason
why
this
case
is
here.
if
this
court
is
so
far
away
from
--
quite
a
waste
away
from
our
tribunal
and
that
is
because
of
the
fact
that
it
should
not
be
decided
on
that.
it
should
be
decided
not
on
difficulty
of
proof
or
the
burden
on
society
but
whether
or
not
this
man
was
granted
his
constitutional
rights.
and
that
--
the
--
mr.
shepherd
who
was
a
former
--
former
solicitor
general
from
michigan
was
a
little
worried
about
this
thing
too
and
his
response
to
our
petition,
he
said
it
is
the
testimony
of
the
former
sheriff
that
troubles
somewhat
for
a
word
unqualified
or
if
it
showed
beyond
doubt
that
this
officer,
that
is
sheriff
struble,
by
threats
of
my
violence
so
and
still
the
petitioner
was
here
that
he
was
induced
to
confess
and
plead
guilty.
the
position
of
the
state
might
prove
untenable.
now,
he
did
not
admit
error
there,
he
just
--
and
--
and
he
wanted
this
to
come
before
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
to
see
whether
it
was
shown
that
the
threats
of
my
violence,
the
statements
to
this
man
were
sufficient.
mr.
william
h.
culver
that's
the
response
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
--
on
--
to
our
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
michigan
and
it's
filed
in
the
files
and
records
of
this
case.
again,
i
--
i
wish
to
thank
very
much
for
the
opportunity
to
appear
here
and
to
represent
mr.
moore.
mr.
william
h.
culver
if
the
court
please.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
clearly
the
issue
of
duress
and
the
arrest
and
coercion
is
in
this
case.
the
record
shows
that
the
court
granted
a
motion
of
attorney
roxboro
to
bring
that
into
the
case
and
that
secondly,
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
although
at
one
time,
this
was
based
on
the
de
meerleer
case
in
the
initial
part
of
the
proceeding
that
subsequently
after
mr.
roxboro
heard
the
testimony
and
after
he
got
into
--
into
the
proceeding
that
it
was
extended
and
we
would
ask
as
i've
indicated
when
we
started
out,
the
attempt
is
to
put
this
into
a
category
with,
we'll
say
de
meerleer
and
quicksall
or
something
like
that.
this
case
is
the
case
as
they
all
are
seems
to
me
onto
themselves.
and
then
finally,
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
which
i
think
he
recently
asked
and
which
i
think
raises
the
distinct
problem
here
and
that
is,
how
do
you
get
around
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge,
judge
weimer
said,
“i'm
satisfied
that
this
is
freely
and
voluntary
made”.
and
i
--
i
submit
the
answer
to
that
is
that
no
one,
not
even
mr.
moore's
lawyers
knew
until
1951
of
the
fact
that
sheriff
struble
had
been
afraid
and
had
warned
mr.
moore
that
if
he
--
if
that
--
he
was
afraid
that
he
couldn't
protect
you.
and
therefore,
that
even
though
the
statement
by
judge
weimer
was
contemporaneous
with
the
--
with
the
sentence
that
i
submit
that
judge
weimer
himself
didn't
know
what
we
know
right
now
and
that
was
that
the
sheriff
has
told
his
men
that
he
couldn't
protect
him.
now,
he
knew
all
the
rest
of
the
things.
he
knew
about
the
youth
and
inexperienced
mr.
moore
but
he
didn't
know
the
facts
that
we
know
now.
and
therefore,
i
submit
to
you
that
we
--
we
wish
to
depend
upon
this
delayed
--
this
right
of
a
delayed
motion
and
the
right
to
this
testimony
in
the
record
because
it
does
show
something
that
is
going
--
that's
why
we'll
show
up
again
before
this
court
and
that
is
that
the
sentencing
judge
on
a
plea
of
guilty
may
not
know
all
of
the
circumstances
and
it
can
only
be
dug
out
by
an
attorney
and
by
cross
examination.
and
another
thing
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
after
mr.
struble,
the
sheriff
was
put
on
in
testifying
in
this
case
that
the
prosecution
then
spend
a
day
and
a
half
trying
to
--
to
prejudice
trying
to
show
that
mr.
sheriff
struble
was
wrong
and
of
course
you've
got
the
pictures
of
the
jail
and
everything
that
shows
that
this
man
couldn't
possibly
has
been
subject
to
duress.
but
you'll
notice
that
nobody
--
that
--
that
he
wasn't
in
that
jail
all
the
time
that
he
was
only
there
one
night
according
to
sheriff
struble
and
nobody
agrees
about
that
and
i
submit
that
it's
outside
the
record,
but
the
man
was
kept
in
the
police
headquarters
in
a
jail
in
the
basement
or
if
you
want
to
get
down
there,
you
just
walk
down
the
stairs.
you
don't
have
to
go
pass
an
officer
at
all.
so,
i
submit
to
the
court
again
that
the
issue
of
duress
and
coercion
is
before
the
court
and
it's
in
the
--
in
the
record.
and
secondly,
that
he
didn't
--
we
don't
pretend
that
this
is
the
de
meerleer
case.we
think
it
looks
a
little
like
the
de
meerleer
case.
it
looks
a
little
like
the
quicksall
case,
but
that's
--
that
the
--
our
only
hope
of
success,
i
submitted
the
fact
that
this
court
is
the
last
word
and
that
this
will
be
a
people
versus
moore
case
which
you
don't
try
that
to
correlate
and
say,
“well,
it
doesn't
fit
in
any
case
that's
been
before
the
court
exactly.”
mr.
william
h.
culver
i
--
i
think
if
the
court
please
that
in
reading
page
52
and
53
--
in
52
he
says,
i
told
him
if
he
was
guilty,
he
might
better
own
up
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
where
is
that?
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes,
sir.
but
then
he
contended
and
he
says,
“it
is
my
duty
and
it's
up
to
me
to
protect
you,
to
use
every
effort
at
my
command
to
protect
you.
but
i
said
the
tension
is
high
out
there
and
i'm
just
telling
you
what
could
happen
if
it
was
started
by
someone
else.
i
don't
know
what
language
i
used
in
the
end.
regardless,
that
was
substantially
what
he
said.
now,
we
know
the
reaction
of
that
statement,
i
mean,
if
he
said
it
to
you,
i
wouldn't
--
certainly,
wouldn't
have
frightened
you
probably.
but
he
said
it
to
this
willie
moore
and
willie
moore
has
testified
and
i
think
it's
uncontradictive
that
after
the
man
told
me
he
couldn't
protect
me,
otherwise
that's
what
willie
moore
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
culver
that's
--
mr.
william
h.
culver
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
culver
in
1948
or
1949?
mr.
william
h.
culver
i
believe,
if
the
court
please,
because
it
appears
that
his
attorney
at
that
time
was
not
too
well
versed
in
the
fact
of
the
matter.
mr.
william
h.
culver
yes.
yes,
sir.
