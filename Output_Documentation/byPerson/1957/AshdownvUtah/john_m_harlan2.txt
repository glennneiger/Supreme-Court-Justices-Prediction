justice
john
m.
harlan
didn't
he
say
that
he
had
taken
a
drink
of
lemon
juice
and
that
it
was
very
bitter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
pinpoint
in
the
record
without
taking
anytime
where
it
appears
that
she
was
advised
of
her
right
to
counsel,
right
to
remain
silent.
if
you
haven't
got
it
there,
don't
--
don't
carry,
i
can
get
it
from
your
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
in
this
case,
accepting
the
statement
that
this
woman
was
advised
that
she
could
have
a
counsel
that
if
she
had
asked
for
a
counsel
at
that
stage.
your
police
officers
if
they
followed
what
you
say
is
the
utah
law
would
have
stopped
interrogating
until
she
got
a
lawyer
or
if
they
hadn't
done
that,
that
your
court
would
have
stepped
in
and
said,
“no,
you
can't
--
we
won't
accept
--
we
won't
admit
anything
that
followed
her
request
for
counsel.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
if
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
find
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
the
one,
your
court
in
this
case
excluded
the
written
confession
which
followed
after
she
asked
for
a
lawyer
that
they
were
going
beyond
the
utah
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
it
in
this
case,
would
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
the
question
that
i
put
to
you
a
few
moments
ago,
you
said
that
my
interpretation
of
the
utah
law
was
not
correct.
therefore,
if
that
so,
the
court
here
must
have
been
doing
something
that
went
beyond
what
you
conceived
to
be
the
utah
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
had
you
got
cases
on
it
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
utah
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
utah
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
court
sustained
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
turn
it
around
the
other
way
and
if
there's
an
ambiguity
as
to
what
was
discussed
during
the
20
minutes,
how
many
hours
before
she
confess
was
she
advised
of
her
right
to
do
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
judge,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
record
shows
as
the
states
as
it
does,
that
she
was
advised
of
her
right
to
counsel.
forget
about
10
minutes,
15
minutes
or
what
was
said
before
that,
but
she
was
advised
of
her
right
to
counsel
on
an
early
stage
of
this
proceeding.
and
the
--
the
record
shows
she
made
no
request
for
counsel
until
later
on,
how
does
that
affect
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
get
us
--
forget
about
those
new
lawsuits
in
the
testimony
and
let's
suppose
the
case
was
clear
in
the
record,
that
20
minutes
after
she
--
they
started
to
interrogate
her,
she
asked
for
counsel,
that
she
was
advised
of
a
regular
counsel
and
then
didn't
raise
the
question
again
until
four
hours
later
just
after
she
confessed.
how
does
that
affect
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
does
not
affect
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
assuming
for
the
moment
that
she
was
so
advised.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
record
established
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
that
state
tells
us
that's
the
fact.
assuming
that
it
is
clear,
that
we
have
to
take
it
is
clear,
that
she
was
advised
promptly
as
to
her
constitutional
rights,
right
to
counsel
and
then
did
nothing
for
three
and
half
hours
afterwards,
how
does
that
affect
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
put
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
put
mrs.
hopkins
on
the
stand?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
put
her
on
for
the
limited
purpose
of
this
confession?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
record
that
your
examination
of
her,
that
goes
to
the
validity
or
the
truth
or
the
accuracy
of
what's
just
been
read,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
she
did
not
deny
what
this
officer
said
as
you
just
read
that
he
had
advised
her
of
her
constitutional
rights.
she
did
not
deny
that,
her
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
entire
examination
of
her,
which
is
about
a
page
and
half
long
relates
only
to
what
was
told
her
by
the
district
attorney
as
to
his
experience
in
getting
accused
of
killing
five
men.
