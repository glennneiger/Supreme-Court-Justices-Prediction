well,
what
--
what's
the
significance

testimony
at
pages
20
and
21?
he
is
talking
about
the
time
when
he
found
the
deceased
in
the
process
of
having
the
seizure
from
which
he
died
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
then
he
said
that
he
instructed
the
mortician
not
to
disturb
anything
because
he
thought
a
coroner's
jury
should
be
called,
and
then
he
went
to
say
that
he
completed
an
autopsy,
and
he
took
--
put
certain
organs
in
a
container
and
turned
them
over
to
the
deputy
sheriff.
well,
when
did
all
of
that
happen?

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
don't
understand
is
that
this
all
happened
on
july
5th,
that
is
--
that
that
was
a
visit
to
the
ashdown
home
and
the
death
was
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
july
5th?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
on
page
29,
it
appears
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
sheriff
that
on
july
6th,
he
says
at
the
request
of
the
county
attorney
and
the
sheriff,
he
went
to
the
dr.
williams'
office
and
picked
up
the
specimen
and
took
it
to
salt
lake
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
why
is
the
county
attorney
and
the
sheriff
be
--
going
to
dr.
william's
office
to
have
these
specimens
picked
up
the
day
after
the
death?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
the
police
--
but

police
were
in
this
before

j.
brennan,

and
this
was
before
he
died?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
--
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
inference
may
reasonably
be
drawn
to
such
evidence
as
there
is
that
when
the
police
interrogated
him
they
did
have
a
suspicion
that
she
was
just
misstating
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
have
--
would
they
go
beyond
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
more
than
mere
suspicions.
they
were
rather
confident,
they
were
rather
frail
of
the
--
the
one
responsible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
version
of
--that
that's
the
versions
of
the
officers
with
20
different
versions
given
by
her?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
--
only
testimony
is
the
officer's
--
what
she
told
as
to
the
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
give
them
answers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
during
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
did
she
confirm
in
her
testimony
what
she
told
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
briefly
state
what
congress
has
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
truth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
conviction
would
be
reversed,
she's
retried.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
she
then
be
a
subject
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
did
you
tell
they
would
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

and
