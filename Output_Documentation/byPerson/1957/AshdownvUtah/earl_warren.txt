to
the
police
before

chief
justice
earl

did
the
police
have
knowledge?
what
i'm
trying
to
get

the
--
did
the
sheriff

knowledge
at
the
time
he
interrogated
your
client?
chief
justice
earl

--

--
chief

earl

i

i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
they

--
did
they
take
the
stomach
and
the
organs
from
the
body
before

was
buried?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
disinter
the
body
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and

thing?

better.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
budge.
chief
justice
earl

he
was
in
the
service,
aren't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
want
you
to
set
up
--
you
set
up
at
the
counsel
table
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
budge,
did
the
--
did
the
report
of
the
chemist
or
your
state
--
state
chemist

that
there
was
arsenic

chief

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
strychnine.
yes,
strychnine.
i
said
arsenic.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
and
that
had
been
received
the
day
before
the
funeral?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
all
events,
they
had
it
--
they
had
it
available
to
sheriff's
office
at
the
time
they
interrogated
the
--
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
follow
that
when
she
did
ask
for
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
budge,
do
you
want
us
to
--
to
assume
that
she
could've
had
counsel
in
this
case
or
that
they
have
the
right
to
examine
her
without
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
they
--
oh,
go
on.
in
other
words,
you
take
--
you
take
the
position
that
they
have
the
right
to
--
to
make
this
particular
investigation
of
her
that
they
did
without
according
her
the
right
of
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
budge,
do
you
want
us
to
read
this
--
this
record
to
mean
that
she
could
have
had
a
lawyer
at
anytime
she
asked
for
it
in
this
conversation
up
to
the
time
that
she
did
ask
for
one
and
then
she
was
denied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
is
it
a
question
of
what
your
court
might
have
done
later
or
is
it
a
question
of
what
they
did
in
that
room?
the
question
of
what
they
did
in
that
room
determines
whether
or
not
there
was
coercion.
it
determines
whether
or
not
she
was
entitled
to
have
--
have
counsel.
now,
the
thing
--
the
--
the
question
that
bothers
me
is
--
is
this,
you
say
that
they
told
her
she
could
have
counsel
if
she
wanted
and
finally
she
said,
“i
want
counsel,”
and
they
in
effect
told
her,
“you
can't
have
it
now."
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
--
do
you
want
--
do
you
think
that
this
record
will
support
our
conclusion
that
--
that
the
police
meant
what
they
said
that
she
could
have
had
a
lawyer
anytime
she
wanted
it
up
to
the
time
that
she
asked
for
it,
but
at
that
time
she
couldn't
have
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
refuse
to
let
them
have
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
--
without
them
being
able
to
have
counsel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
--
may
i
finish
just
one
more
question
please?
well,
then
what
is
the
use
of
your
district
attorney
advising
her
that
she
can
have
counsel
if
it
is
your
position
that
she
can't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
but
if
she
starts
talking
at
all,
that
she
waives
her
right
to
counsel
and
that
thereafter
they
can
--
they
can
proceed
in
any
manner
they
desire
without
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
point
--
my
point
is
this,
that
the
only
test
we
have
as
to
whether
that
statement
that
she
could
have
counsel
was
made
in
good
faith
or
not
must
be
based
on
the
action
of
the
authorities
when
she
actually
asked
for
counsel
and
then
they
denied
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
told
her
--
they
--
they
questioned
her
for
an
hour-and-a-half
or
two
hours
after
that,
didn't
they?
and
told
her
she
couldn't
have
counsel
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
they
examined
her
for
an
hour-and-a-half
or
two
hours
after
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no,
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
they
examined
her?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
an
hour-and-a-half
or
two
hours?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
they
would
have
--
have
been
anymore
agreeable
to
her
having
counsel
if
she
had
asked
early
in
the
interview?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
it
be
a
fair
--
would
it
be
a
fair
inference
to
say
--
for
us
to
say
that
--
or
conclude
rather
that
if
they
refused
to
give
her
or
let
her
have
counsel
in
the
middle
of
the
interrogation
that
they
would
have
also
have
refused
to
let
her
have
counsel
if
she
had
asked
for
it
earlier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
that
after
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wouldn't
you
mind
stating
it
again
as
you
understand
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
this
point
that
justice
harlan
has
just
asked
you
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
vitally
is
there
to
the
statement
and
what
meaning
is
there
in
the
statement
if
they
advised
a
person
in
those
circumstances
that
the
--
that
he
is
entitled
to
counsel
if
he
wants
it.
and
then,
it
is
their
secret
intention
to
refuse
it
to
him.
what
--
what
value
is
there
in
advising
him
of
his
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
erickson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
where
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
69.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
have
the
citation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
bother
go
right
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
the
--
with
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
jury
found
--
did
not
inflict
the
death
penalty
in
her
first
trial,
relieve
her
of
the
--
the
possibility
of
her
being
convicted
of
a
capital
offense
if
she's
retried?
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
could
be
convicted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
a
capital
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
your
--
finish
your
sentence
there
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
thank
--
judge,
we
thank
you
for
your
willingness
to
represent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
without
compensation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
judge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.

you,
mr.

your
representation
of
your
state
interest.
