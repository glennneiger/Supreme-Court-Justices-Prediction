mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
chief
justice
warren
and
fellow
associates.
this
is
ms.
milda
hopkins
ashdown,
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
setting
out
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
invoked
under
28
u.s.c.a.
section
1257.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah
entered
on
april
the
30th,
1956
--
1956,
a
petition
which
was
denied,
it
was
unanimous
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
utah.
this
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
on
december
the
7th,
1956
and
a
brief
on
opposition
was
filed
by
the
respondent
and
the
certiorari
was
allowed
by
this
court
on
june
the
30th
--
30,
1957.
i've
set
out
the
record
carefully.
now,
the
constitutional
provision
is
first
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
provides
in
pertinent
part.
i
don't
think
i'll
have
to
read
that,
your
honors,
all
of
that
in
article
7,
i've
set
out.
third,
the
self-incrimination
and
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
also
the
utah
section
is
quite
set
forth.
now,
the
question
presented
before
this
court
whether
the
petitioner
in
a
state
capital
case
was
denied
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
facts
is
this,
the
petitioner
was
taken
in
for
question,
questioning
in
a
an
emotional
state
and
irrational
state
of
mind
immediately
after
the
funeral
of
her
deceased
husband
and
was
subjected
to
a
series
of
constant
interrogation
by
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
and
the
district
attorneys
for
approximately
five-and-a-half
hours.
during
the
time,
the
petitioner
did
not
have
food,
rest,
was
not
properly
advised
of
her
constitutional
rights.
she
requested
--
her
relatives
requested
to
go
in
there
and
they
were
denied
that
privilege.
she
asked
for
legal
counsel.
that
was
refused.
the
record
--
i
have
set
the
record
up
very
carefully
in
my
brief.
she
was
denied
those
rights.
now,
we
set
up
this
constant
interrogation
by
the
sheriff
and
his
deputies
without
friends
or
relatives
and
the
petitioner
under
three
was
denied
due
process
of
law
because
the
jury
under
instructions
says
--
were
asked
to
pass
on
weight
and
credibility
given
to
the
testimony
concerning
such
admissions
upon
the
considerations
and
the
circumstances
ruling
on
the
testimony
of
all
the
witnesses
in
relation
to
there
was
not
given
to
the
jury.
now,
the
statement
of
the
case,
it
shows
that
the
petitioner
milda
hopkins
charges
--
she
was
charged
by
information
with
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
the
trial
was
held
in
parowan
from
july
the
5th
--
no,
excuse
me
please.
she
was
charged
with
murder
in
first
degree
in
iron
county,
utah
for
killing
a
person
of
ray
ashdown,
the
record
shows
that.
a
trial
was
had
before
a
jury
in
iron
counsel.
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
which
i
represent,
has
followed
this
case
to
all
courts
and
they're
(inaudible)
as
to
affidavit
and
also
a
pauperism
in
this
kind
--
in
this
court.
now,
the
testimony
shows
the
oral
confession
made
by
the
petitioner
during
the
interrogation,
it
was
obtained
in
violation
of
her
constitutional
rights.
i've
set
the
record
down,
record
88.
but
the
trial
court
ruled,
admitted
--
admitted
such
testimony,
no
other
evidence
was
given
after
that.
the
defendants
rested
and
raised
these
provisions.
later,
the
petitioner
appealed
from
her
conviction
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction
on
april
the
30th,
1956,
shown
in
the
record
at
page
153
and
denied
the
petition
for
rehearing,
october
the
5th,
1956.
on
december
the
17th
petition
was
filed
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
by
this
court.
now,
the
petitioner
was
the
wife
of
ray
ashdown,
they
lived
at
cedar
city,
utah.
and
on
the
morning
of
july
the
5th,
1955,
dr.
williams
was
called
at
the
ashdown
home
and
mrs.
ashdown
to
attend
her
--
by
mr.
--
mrs.
ashdown
to
attend
to
her
husband.
when
the
doctor
arrived,
mr.
ashdown
was
having
a
generalized
convulsion,
seizure
and
death
was
imminent.
and
took
another
convulsion
immediately
after
and
died.
later,
the
stomach
was
sent
to
the
state
chemist,
analyzed
and
there
was
strychnine
found
in
the
body
of
ray
ashdown.
and
on
the
9th
day
of
july
1955,
the
funeral
was
held
at
the
cemetery.
at
the
cemetery,
the
sheriff
of
iron
county,
arthur
nielsen
asked
mrs.
ashdown's
son-in-law
to
bring
mrs.
ashdown
to
the
city
and
county
building,
which
he
did.
the
defendant
came
with
her
sister
and
at
that
time
there
was
present
the
sheriff
and
his
three
or
four
or
five
deputies.
it
was
a
hot
day
and
they
served
the
girls
with
lemonade.
there
were
--
and
the
sheriff
at
that
time
went
into
the
court
room
and
said
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
milda
alone.
when
she
arrived
in
the
court
room,
the
three
sheriffs
were
there
plus
the
district
attorney
and
she
was
interrogated
for,
the
record
shows,
five-and-a-half
hours,
interrogated.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
continuously,
justice
frankfurter.
the
record
even
--
i
didn't
dispute
that.
in
fact,
one
of
the
deputies
had
even
went
longer
than
that.
the
record
shows
that
she
went
in
there
at
four
and
come
out
of
it
quarter
to
ten.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
she
was
suspected
of
that.
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
they
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
it
was
suspicion
that
they
had.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
very
little,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
this
is
the
only
thing
here
is
this,
they
first
interrogated
her
at
her
home.
there
was
two
interrogations
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
one
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
one,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
one,
they
come
there
and
the
testimonies
in
the
record
there
and
i
cite
that
record,
it's
very
plain
when
they
come
there
was
no
compliant
about
that
questions
and
they
looked
at
cups
and
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
looked
at
cups
and
they
searched
the
frigidaire.
and
that
was
done
before.
we
--
that
was
just
they're
suspicion
there.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
will
do
that.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
do,
justice
frankfurter.
they
went
there
for
the
purpose
they
did
suspect
her.
now,
i'd
have
to
go
outside
the
record,
the
attorney
general
knows
why
did
suspect
her
but
it's
a
different
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
no,
i'd
have
to
--
they
had
a
suspicion,
she
went
up
and
they
interrogated
her
first
and
then
the
--
the
chemist
kept
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
there
was
only
the
doctor
who
went
out
there,
who
looked
at
ray
and
he
said,
“ray,
you
are
under
--
you
are
sick,”
the
record
is
there,
“what
have
you
--
have
you
had
poison?
had
you
taken
something
bitter?"
that's
your
first.
that's
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
then
after
the
burial
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
what
was
his
answer
to
that?
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
he
said
--
the
deceased
said,
i
drank
some
--
it's
in
my
brief
and
cites
the
citation
that,
"i
took
something
that
was
sour
--
sour.”
in
fact,
that
had
--
and
went
through
his
other
things,
this
led
him
to
suspicion
which
i
came
quite
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
true,
justice
harlan,
that's
true.
so
after
that,
that
was
on
the
5th,
the
officers
come
down
there
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
know
he
had.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes,
he
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
the
record
shows
that
they
took
the
stomach
and
sent
it
to
the
state
chemist.
my
record
sets
that
out
plain.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
as
soon
as
he
went
to
the
--
to
the
place,
he
just
told
them
that
there
was
strychnine.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
strychnine.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
immediately
thereafter,
the
officers
had
sent
him
there
and
he
pronounced
it
without
analyzing
that
you've
taken
something
sour
there
and
it
was
strychnine
and
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
--
the
record
would
bear
that
out
in
a
way.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
was
before
the
funeral.
that
was
on
the
5th
day
--
5th
day.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i'd
say
a
man
was
sent
--
the
sheriff,
deputy
sheriff,
it
shows
in
the
record
that
he
took
it
to
salt
lake
and
brought
the
stomach
back
after
the
5th
day.
now,
whether
it
was
the
3rd
day
or
the
4th
day
he
brought
it,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
he
had
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
no,
he
had
suspicion
only.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
suspicion.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
right.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
sir?
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
happened
after
the
funeral.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
happened
right
after
he
--
he
died,
your
honor,
which
he
died
on
--
they
immediately
got
the
body
and
the
intestines
and
all
and
send
it
to
salt
lake
city
and
it
took
about
three
days
for
it
to
return.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
the
only
thing
i
can
say,
justice
frankfurter,
is
on
that,
when
the
doctor
was
called
and
--
and
made
those
statements.
that's
as
far
as
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
true.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
all,
not
without
going
outside
the
record
which
i
will
not
do,
i
would
be
happy
if
i
could.
then
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
there
was
not.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
she
made
the
telephone
calls
for
the
doctor.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
true.
the
record
will
show.
i
have
that
so
plain.
i
have
so
many
things
when
it
comes
to
record
that
i
will
later
show
in
the
court.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
have
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
and
the
death.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
salt
lake
city.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
there's
no
question
the
--
the
doctor
is
notified
and
they
have
other
suspicions.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
the
burial,
i
think
will
put
us
at
ease,
the
9th,
the
same
day
as
they
questioned
her.
she
first
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
they
went
to
the
funeral
--
they
went
to
the
funeral
then
they
returned
at
the
funeral
two
or
three
hours
and
the
sheriff
had
her
ready
to
take
her
for
the
questioning.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
right.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
well,
that
was
--
you
see
--
see
was
buried
--
buried
you
see
four
days
after
that,
after
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
no,
they
didn't
hold
the
burial
up.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
right.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
think
--
that's
right,
they
did.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
no.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
it
--
the
chemist
report
later
showed
why
we
got
to
it,
those
things
would
be
clarified
and
i
set
out
that
in
my
record.
you
will
find
those.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
well,
i'd
be
coming
to
that
later
on.
but
it
was
taken
to
salt
lake,
they
had
no
--
the
sheriff
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
they
immediately,
i
think,
took
it
there.
i'll
reserve
my
other
10
minutes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
--
be
prepared
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
--
to
answer.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
never
really
got
at
this
case,
but
i
certainly
disagree
with
the
counsel
as
to
the
procedure
that
was
used
in
this
case.
then
on,
i
think,
the
case
i
cite
is
justice
sutherland,
powell
versus
alabama,
from
that
case,
justice
sullivan
or
justice
sutherland
says,
“even
the
intelligent
and
educated
lay
--
layman
has
small
and
sometimes
no
skill
in
the
science
of
law.
if
charged
with
a
crime,
he
is
incapable
of
determining
for
himself
whether
the
indictment
is
good
or
bad.
he
is
unfamiliar
with
the
rules
of
evidence.
left
without
the
aid
of
counsel,
he
may
be
put
on
trial
without
proper
charges,
and
convicted
upon
incompetent
evidence,
irrelevant
to
the
issue
or
otherwise
admissible.
he
lacks
the
skill
and
he
lacks
knowledge
to
prepare
his
defense,
even
though
he
have
a
perfect
one.
he
requires
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
of
every
step
in
the
proceedings
against
him."
that
was
our
form
of
justice.
now,
i
disagree
very
much
with
the
attorney
budge.
if
judge
--
budge
had
deprived
this
case
or
callister,
never
would
they
use
the
procedure
that
was
used
by
those
officers.
now
the
record
discloses,
i
can
give
your
record
off.
i
have
in
my
record
clear,
if
i
can
get
this
court
to
read
this
record,
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
whether
there
was
coercion,
we
take
this
when
--
was
she
advised
over
constitutional
rights?
the
record
will
tell
you
that.
they
said
they
talked
15
or
20
minutes
about
family
affairs.
that
isn't
true.
the
record
bears
me
on
that.
sherriff
nelson
testified
on
direct
examination
that
she
was
sought
by
this
a
few
minutes
after
the
questioning
began.
record
57,
that's
as
soon
as
she
arrived,
mind
you
at
the
courtroom,
at
the
courthouse,
this
lady
wasn't
in
--
she
thought
she
was
in
the
trial.
they
didn't
go
in
the
sheriff's
office.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i'll
--
i'll
bring
that
to
you,
right
now.
sherriff
nelson
testified
on
direct
examination
that
she
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
record
69.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
testified
on
direct
test
--
examination,
she
was
advised
a
few
minutes
after
the
questioning
began.
that's
record
57.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
well,
as
soon
as
she
got
to
the
courthouse.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
would
be
the
little
after
four
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
--
as
she
stepped
in
the
courtroom.
there
was
no
friendly
conversation.
before
the
petitioner
was
advised,
a
good
many
questions,
a
good
many
answers
were
made
in
that
period
of
time.
it's
stated
that
the
petitioners'
talk
--
talk
mostly
during
this
time
about
family
affairs,
but
the
record
shows
that
she
was
being
questioned.
now,
that
sheriff
nelson,
i'll
give
you
the
fact.
well,
i
remember
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
--
this
on
the
record,
your
honor,
i'll
give
it
to
you.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
record
132.
well,
as
i
remember
when
i
started
the
quest
here,
i
asked
her
if
she
give
anymore
thought
about
where
that
poison
might
have
come
from
and
was
--
and
that
was
pronounced
that
ray
had
her
gut.
she
had
--
said
no.
she
didn't
know
anything
more
about
it
and
she
did.
i
know
whether
she
used
the
words
or
not,
but
she
admit
that
she
didn't
know
anymore
about
it.
well
i
said,
"mrs.
ashdown,
the
doctor
still
claims
that
ray
has
been
poisoned
and
we'd
like
to
find
out
what
happened
and
asked
her
if
there
was
any
chance
that
she
made
a
mistake
of
any
kind
and
put
poison,
lemon
juice
and
thought
it
was
salt."
and
she
didn't
think
she'll
(inaudible).
i
asked
her
if
she
knew
of
any
poison
that
was
around
the
premises,
then
questioned
sheriff
(inaudible)
asking
mrs.
ashdown
if
she
had
made
a
mistake.
was
mrs.
ashdown
informed
as
whether
or
not
she
needed
to
answer
your
questions?
answer
“i
don't
believe
at
that
time.
i
believe
it
was
a
little
later
when
we
advised
her.”
when
you
advised
her
of
her
constitutional
rights?
i
don't
believe
that
was
right
on
the
start
--
start
record
shows
page
56
and
57.
and
you
kept
(inaudible)
in
there,
three
hours
questioned
her
by
reading
the
statutes
to
her,
defining
manslaughter
and
she
didn't
even
--
wasn't
even
charged
with
murder.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
no,
sir.
i
did
not.
certainly
now,
you
come
back
and
say,
“you
advised
her
of
her
constitutional
rights
and
today
he
was
reading
the
statutes.
now,
which
was
it
--
which
was
it?
he
advised
her
of
her
constitutional
rights
that
was
later
on.
question
“you
know
what
time
that
was?
how
many
hours?
this
is
(inaudible),
“i
don't
recollect
--
recollect
the
time,
no
sir.
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
say.
two,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
"would
it
be
three?"
"i
wouldn't
say
that."
"could
you
guess
at
that
time
like
you
could
two
minutes?"
“no.”
sheriff
willard
says,
“there
was
too
much
conversation
and
too
many
questions
i
to
reckon."
now,
regarding
patrick
furman,
the
district
attorney
who
was
present
at
the
hearing
the
past
--
the
time
has
set
forth
in
the
brief.
there's
no
question.
i
can't
figure
when
that
law
--
that
was
our
jury.
but
that
was
supposed
to
be
her
constitutional
rights
(inaudible)
there's
no
dispute
about
that
at
all.
he
brings
out
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
utah
and
he
reads
those
statutes
to
mildred
ashdown.
she
would
no
more
know
what
those
statutes
were.
and
at
that
time,
he
says
he
defined
the
crime
before
he
knew
anything
about
it.
he
says,
“mildred,
you
better
tell
the
truth
that
i
was
in
the
army
and
i
killed
five
men,”
and
thereby
telling
the
truth,
“i
was
exonerated.
i
might
have
faced
a
firing
squad.
i
will
tell
you
the
truth.
it
helped
me.
it
helped
me
because
i
suspect
now,
i
only
read
two
statutes,”
he
said
to
her.
that's
in
the
record
pointed
out
to
the
court
and
said,
“was
man
--
was
murder
in
the
first
degree
or
voluntary
manslaughter?”
that
could've
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
only
one
verdict
should
be
given,
couldn't
have
been
manslaughter.
it
was
an
accident
trying
to
make
her
believe
that
she'd
know
a
man.
she
--
she
just
said,
"well,
it
was
just
an
accident."
and
then
that
concluded
that
he
could
bring
an
action
for
manslaughter,
which
was
--
which
is
about
reading
the
statutes
to
her.
that's
in
the
record.
i
set
that
up.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
they
did,
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
well,
it's
hard
to
get
at
first
conviction.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
it's
hard
to
get.
now,
i
call
your
attention
to
--
i've
set
it
out
in
my
brief.
there
is
no
question
about
it,
that
when
they
asked
for
a
lawyer,
there
wasn't
words
of
a
predatory
nature.
she
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
she
didn't
get
it.
now,
the
judge
ruled
that
the
oral
confession
was
all
right,
but
the
written
after
he
signed
it
was
no
good.
so,
as
to
the
sheriff
--
it's
in
there.
i
can't
--
i'm
just
going
to
try
to
get
a
hold
of
this.
as
for
the
sheriff
and
i
cited
in
my
record,
sheriff,
when
she
asked
for
counsel,
"why
didn't
you
give
it
to
her?"
and
he
said
--
it's
set
out
in
my
brief,
in
the
record,
he
says,
“well,
i
didn't
know
i
wanted
to
be
sure."
i
think
that's
the
words.
"i
want
to
be
sure
that
she
was
of
good
mind
and
knew
what
she
was
doing
that
way
--
what
she
was
doing."
in
other
words,
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes.
it's
right
in
my
brief.
there,
the
citation.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
there.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
have,
your
honor.
but
that
statement
was
made
that
she
was
irrational,
words
to
that
effect.
she
had
been
moaning,
groaning
in
there
for
five
hours
or
four.
that's
even
the
testimony
on
the
sheriffs.
that's
even
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
the
family.
she
was
moaning
and
groaning.
she
didn't
know
what
she
was
doing.
now
our
supreme
court
and
i
have
no
time
between
that
decision,
but
it
--
it
read
that
decision.
it's
wrong
in
itself.
i
couldn't
get
justices
to
listen
to
me,
but
it
isn't
since
the
time
they
questioned
her
and
good
friends.
in
other
words,
time
and
so
forth
that
she
wouldn't
confess
to
a
crime
unless
she
had
done
it.
that's
in
the
--
the
opinion
of
our
court.
now,
the
question
isn't
here
before
this
court,
we
know
that
it
did.
mildred
ashdown,
hillary
ashdown,
many
people
asked
me
that.
but
that
isn't
before
the
court
at
all,
whether
she
killed
him
or
not.
justice
frankfurter
set
aside
this
--
an
opinion
of
his
even
it's
the
procedure,
it's
following
your
men
and
officer
must
do
--
must
do
for
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
have
cited
he
is
--
he
is
there,
have
cited
the
case
that
judge
black
called.
justice
black,
the
riding
point
with
what
i
have.
many
people
asked
me,
"why
didn't
she
kill
any
civilians?"
that
isn't
before
this
court,
never
will
be.
it's
your
due
process.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
she's
retried.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
no.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
they
couldn't
convict
her
at
this
given
statute.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
there
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
well,
that'll
be
my
opinion.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
she
can
be
tried
over
in
this
court.
it
goes
back
for
trial.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
this
--
this
penalty
here
that
convicted
her
of
first
degree
--
degree
murder,
if
this
court
should
rule
that
this
evidence
was
incompetent,
which
you
or
the
guardians
of
our
constitution,
those
confessions
and
the
oral
confessions
won't
go
in
the
trial.
they've
tried
her.
what
evidence
the
state
would
have,
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
we
do.
now
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes,
we
have
the
case
here,
rust
versus
sullivan.
they
were
executed,
which
the
--
the
supreme
court
denied
the
writ.
now,
i
wondered
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
well,
she
could
be
if
they
did
prove
it.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
she
could.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
she
could
--
she
could
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
is
--
no,
it
wouldn't
be
double
jeopardy,
but
this
goes
back
for
a
new
trial.
that's
correct.
now
--
now,
we
will
take
the
--
directly,
after
the
funeral,
she
was
taken
in
to
be
questioned,
that
was
directly.
the
sheriff
had
notified
her
brother-in-law
to
bring
her
to
court
and
they
did
bring
her
there.
i
--
there
isn't
a
record
for
just
how
long
the
funeral
lasted,
but
i
think
the
attorney
general
and
i
could
agree
that
it's
a
--
mormon
funeral
is
--
is
quite
wrong.
she
was
taken
there
after.
she
remained
there
and
was
questioned.
we'll
leave
the
record
to
this
and
so
i
can
pick
it
up
and
show
it
was
a
quarter
to
10,
but
we'll
say
--
as
the
record
say,
"continuous
questioning,
i've
had,
then
asked
for
counsel."
she
asked
for
counsel.
she's
there
maybe,
but
she
was
in
there
an
hour
or
so
but
there's
only
one
more
question
that's
in
that
court
that
she
get
(inaudible).
now,
there
were
no
stenographic
reports.
how
i
wish
there
have
been
or
a
tape
recording
machine
because
all
the
officers,
they
differ
as
to
the
constitutional
rights.
and
as
i
read
the
testimony
of
(inaudible)
and
sheriff
nelson
on
direct
examination
was
r.h.
benson
and
other
deputy
sheriff
present
during
the
conversation.
nor,
he
was
out
on
the
hall
started
taking
care
of
the
door.
there
was
people
trying
to
come
in
and
out
and
we
try
to
keep
everyone
out
of
the
courtroom.
that's
record
56.
did
he
say
he
would
like
to
talk
to
her
alone?
answer,
“yes.”
her
sister
is
with
her
at
the
time
and
her
sister
was
in
the
sheriff's
office
that
time,
“yes,
sir.”
record
102.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
now
on
that,
your
honor,
(inaudible)
she
asked
for
counsel.
she
asked
for
counsel.
she
says
--
more
than
that,
her
testimony,
sheriff
says
only
once
--
only
once
that
was
what
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
doesn't
affect
at
all.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
it
does
not
affect
it
because
that
was
the
duty
of
the
officers
before
they
question.
now
mildred,
you
have
the
right
to
counsel
if
you
speak,
as
justice
frankfurter
says,
you
speak
at
your
peril,
he
didn't
use
that
word.
she
should've
been
advised
of
her
constitutional
rights
as
soon
as
she
walked
in
that
building.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
wouldn't
affect
it
unless
there
is
a
waiver
by
her
of
counsel,
a
waiver.
now
the
case
they
cite
is
rust
versus
sullivan,
that
isn't
the
endpoint
at
all.
we
have
a
poor
law
in
utah
on
counsel.
we
don't
have
a
public
defender
at
all.
we
have
a
preliminary
hearing,
which
the
court
will
not
appoint
an
attorney
even
impunity;
they
don't
have
to
do
it.
that's
the
preliminary
hearing.
he
deprived
the
counsel.
salt
lake
city,
we
have
three
or
four
courts
who
lawyers
presides
over
and
then
you
see
that
they
get
lawyers.
they
do
that,
but
our
justice
of
the
peace
is
just
a
matter
--
they'll
advise
him
well.
we've
got
this
preliminary
hearing.
you
can
waive
it
and
you
can
have
a
lawyer
when
you
get
to
the
district
court.
now,
that's
rust
versus
sullivan
case,
but
those
boys,
if
you
read
rust
versus
sullivan,
they
waive
their
right
to
counsel.
they
were
intelligent
but
mildred
didn't.
it
didn't.
now
the
record
--
the
record
bares
me
out
in
this
case
so
it's
not
in
point
in
my
mind,
but
here
we
have
a
different
situation
at
all
where
she
was
denied
the
right
of
a
counsel.
how
could
the
court
admit
the
--
the
oral
confession
there
when
she
makes
the
statement,
he
makes
the
statement,
we
didn't
like
to
take
the
advantage
of
her
that
day,
she
was
irrational
and
we
wanted
to
know
what
she
was
doing.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
57.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
we
have
here.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
we
have
them
on
57.
i
don't
believe
we
start
out
here,
56.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
well,
they
were
complaining
out
being
hot.
it
was
hot
so
we
served
them
a
glass
of
lemonade
and
we
go
on
further
with
mr.
r.
h.
benson,
the
deputy
sheriff
present
during
the
conversation.
no,
he
is
out
in
the
hallway,
sort
of
taking
care
of
the
door.
there
was
people
trying
to
come
in
and
out
and
we
tried
to
keep
everyone
out.
now,
go
ahead
and
tell
us
what
you
said
in
the
courtroom.
well,
i
can
remember
most
things.
i
believe
that
i
said,
"i
don't
believe
i
could
remember
the
things
you
said
and
the
things
that
wells
said.
it's
pretty
hard
to
remember
all
of
those
things.
will
you
tell
us
sheriff
the
part
of
the
conversation
that
you
remember?"
"well,
i
said
to
mrs.
ashdown
again
and
again,
the
doctors
still
claim
ray's
has
been
poisoned
and
we'd
like
to
find
out
what
happened
and
asked
her
if
there
was
any
chance
she'd
made
a
mistake
or
any
kind
food
poison
or
lemon
juice
and
thought
it
was
salt
and
she
--
she
didn't
think
so.
i
asked
her
if
she
knew
of
any
poison
that
was
around
the
premises.
sheriff,
prior
to
asking
mrs.
ashdown
if
she
had
made
a
mistake
was
mrs.
ashdown
informed,
as
to
whether
or
not
she
needed
to
answer
your
questions
--
questions.
i
don't
believe
at
that
time.
i
believe
it
was
later
when
we
advised
her
--
when
you
advised
her
for
constitutional
rights.
i
don't
believe
it
was
right
on
the
start.
pardon
me
for
interrupting
go
ahead
and
tell
us
what
happened
to
his
folk.
we
talked
to
her
a
few
minutes
before
that,
before
you
had
explained
her
constitutional
rights.
"will
you
tell
us
as
nearly
as
you
can
remember
the
words
that
were
used
in
explaining
mrs.
ashdown's
rights?"
"yes.
we
told
her
we
wanted
to
advise
her
of
her
constitutional
rights
and
she
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
that
she
didn't
have
to
answer
any
questions
unless
she
wanted
to."
question
“did
she
--"
question
that
she
didn't
answer
could
be
--
her
question
could
be
used
against
her
in
the
court
if
that
came
to
court.
i
think
that's
about
all
you've
told.
was
anything
said
to
mrs.
ashdown
about?
she
was
free
to
leave
the
courtroom.
what
was
that?
question
“what
was
said
to
mrs.
ashdown
she
was
free
to
leave
the
courtroom
as
she
cared
to?”
answer
“my
(inaudible)
don't
believe
about
that
--
believe
(inaudible)
i
don't
remember
about
that.”
and
after
the
sheriff
who
spoke
on
what
was
said.
well,
i
believe
we
talked
to
her
about
--
we
talked
to
her
about
whether
or
not
she'd
been
out
of
town
and
place
the
last
month.
so
she
did
say
that
they
had
gone
to
(inaudible).
i
think
the
10th
or
11th,
she
told
us
a
little
about
the
trip.
after
that,
sheriff
who
spoke
on
what
was
said,
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
did
not
use
a
--
a
witness
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
--
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
on
cross-examination,
i
cross-examined
only
the
witness.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes,
it
is,
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
you'll
find
--
you'll
find
a
different
time.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
the
record
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
the
only
thing
she
said
is
her
testimony.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
don't
believe,
i
asked
her
that.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
the
only
thing
she
--
she
said
that
she
asked
for
attorney.
i
think
her
statement
was
there.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that's
--
i
put
her
on
a
purpose.i
just
wanted
to
go
into
the
case.
i
wanted
to
stand
on
your
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
in
the
rust
case?
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
the
--
there
was
a
complete
waiver.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
absolutely,
they
explained
to
him
the
preliminary
hearing.
they
explained
to
both
of
them,
intelligent
boys.
they
made
a
complete
waiver
of
--
in
the
rust
versus
sullivan
case.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
they
were
told
well.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
they
were
told
well,
rust
versus
sullivan
how
to
get
a
lawyer.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
but
it
wasn't
here.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
think
there
is.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
that
is,
very
much
so,
because
i
don't
think
under
our
preliminary
hearing,
that
--
and
our
statute,
that
they
have
to
even
appoint
a
lawyer
which
they
should
do
but
they
don't.
only
in
your
city
courts
who
are
more
trustworthy,
small.
in
my
mind,
the
--
i
cannot
conceive
why
the
officer
waited
after
the
funeral
that
the
deceased
questioner
--
they
had
the
chemist
report
on
july
8
--
july
the
8th
--
is
that
my
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
two
minutes.
why
did
they
wait
until
after
she'd
gone
through
the
ordeal
of
the
funeral?
why
did
they
bar
her
sister
and
her
father
and
uncle
into
the
courtroom
and
mislead
them
that
she
hadn't
returned
there.
they
(inaudible).
they
were
refused.
why
did
they
not
request
to
where
he
--
to
ask
for
attorney,
though
she
give
the
answers
she
wanted.
now,
i
think
that
if
the
record
is
carefully
gone
over
the
court,
which
had
no
other
way
out,
there'd
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind.
it
was
a
violation
of
her
constitutional
rights
when
she
asked
for
attorney.
when
the
officers
knew
she
didn't
know
what
she
was
doing
the
day
before
to
admit
the
oral
and
read
the
writ.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
thank
you.
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
this
has
been
the
service
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
i
couldn't
sleep
until
i
--
mr.
j.
vernon
erickson
--
tried.
