continuously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
that
--
when
this
interrogation
of
five-and-a-half
hours
began,
was
she
suspect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
did
the
--
did
the
police
authorities
and
the
prosecutor
--
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
inquiry
of
five-and-a-half
hours
which
you
just
referred
was
begun
with
consciousness
on
the
part
of
the
law
enforcing
officials
that
she
may
be
or
might
be
or
presumably
was
the
--
the
guilty
person?
is
there
any
evidence
on
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
there's
an
inquiry
to
find
out
the
circumstances
of
her
husband's
death?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
bears
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
disturb
the
order
of
--
of
your
argument
if
you
were
to
tell
the
court
with
particularity
the
course
of
events
from
the
time
of
the
death
of
ashdown?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
order
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
what
seems
to
me
a
crucial
question,
namely,
the
attitude
of
the
police
and
the
prosecutor
in
finding
out,
first,
whether
there
was
something
wrong,
whether
there
was
a
mislead.
and
secondly,
against
whom
to
pursue
their
inquiry
because
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
you
agree
that
if
the
police
have
no
suspicion
at
all
but
want
to
clear
up
the
natural
person
to
go
to
in
the
first
instance
is
the
wife
of
the
deceased
in
--
in
these
circumstances,
wouldn't
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
led
the
police
to
think
that
this
wasn't
a
perfectly
natural
death
to
be
followed
by
a
burial
and
--
and
grief
and
all
the
rest?
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
called
for
any
kind
of
inquiry?
people
die
all
the
time,
that's
a
life
event
and
police
don't
make
inquiries.
what
was
there
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
doctor
communicated
with
the
officers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
is
the
record
--
what
--
does
the
record
show
anything
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
a
gap
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
doesn't
show
that
the
doctor
went
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
press
my
question?
namely,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
what
you
think
is
in
the
record
and
nothing
outside
it
bearing
on
this
question,
namely,
when
the
--
pardon
me,
when
the
police,
the
sheriff
and
the
prosecutor,
began
to
interrogate
your
client,
when
they
started
to
do
that,
what
--
what
knowledge
or
what
basis
for
action
by
law
a
enforcing
authority
did
they
have
to
suspect
that
this
woman
was
what
they
would
believe
was
the
murderess
rather
than
they
thought
something
was
wrong
and
they
carried
out
their
duty
for
such
i
believe
it
to
be,
to
have
been
their
duty
to
ascertain,
first,
whether
there
was
something
wrong
and
second,
if
there
was
something
wrong,
who
was
the
wrong
doer?
now,
would
you
state,
confining
yourself
to
the
record
if
you
will,
what
there
was
in
the
knowledge,
in
the
minds
of
the
law
enforcing
authorities
to
get
at
what
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
this
fellow
took
something
which
might
have
caused
death?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
nothing
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this,
could
one
take
notice,
may
it
be
accepted
as
something
that
--
customarily
that
you
may
take
what
is
called
judicial
notice,
that
if
the
police
expect
--
if
the
police
believe
there
was
foul
play
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
particularly
through
poisoning,
that
they
don't
bury
the
body
until
they
make
further
examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
is
there
some
significance
in
the
fact
that
the
body
was
allowed
to
be
buried
that
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
the
burial
held
up?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
police
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
held
it
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
family
matter,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
--
did
the
suggestion
of
poisoning,
was
that
spontaneous
with
her
or
in
response
to
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
that
the
--
the
thought
of
poison,
have
the
officer
suggested
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
according
to
the
record,
did
she
make
this
denial
in
response
to
--
through
intimation
that
they
thought
she
had
poisoned
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
put
to
her
as
--
as
one
of
these
things
that
does
occur
in
life,
a
mistake
in
insertion
of
poison.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i,
before
you
move
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
there,
ask
you
whether
the
appearance
of
the
police,
i
use
that
for
short
for
law
because
--
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
doctor
said
this
man
may
have
died
or
did
die
of
--
suspect
he
died
of
poisoning,
would
that
be
routine
procedure
for
the
police
when
a
death
occurs
under
such
ambiguous
circumstances
to
make
inquiries
at
once,
would
that
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
say
that
was
routine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
something
that
they
guessed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
in
this
inquiry
at
the
--
was
it
at
the
house?
i
haven't
read
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
indication
of
the
length?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
cold
record,
how
long
would
you
estimate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
trouble
you
to
state
what
the
upshot
of
this
guess
that
half
hour
or
so
interrogation
at
the
day
of
the
death
when
they
ask
questions,
does
the
record
show
anything
as
to
the
attitude
of
the
police
or
any
statements
by
--
by
the
authorities
to
her
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
result
of
that
--
of
that
first
interrogation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
was
no
restriction
on
her
liberty
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
brings
you
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
you,
after
the
report
of
the
analyst
had
got
into
the
hands
of
the
sheriff's
office
then
followed
this
interrogation,
what
you've
just
reached
when
i
interrupted
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
before
you
come
to
that
problem,
i
for
one
would
like
to
have
more
knowledge
than
i
now
have
of
the
time
and
that's
confused
(inaudible)
of
the
setting
of
the
scene,
the
people
present,
the
kind
of
pressure,
if
it
can
be
called
pressure,
what
her
condition
was,
what
her
desires
were
which
were
rejected,
what
alleviations
for
her
condition
the
police
did
or
didn't
afford
her
on
her
request?
i
think
all
those
things
are
relevant
before
you
reach,
if
i
may
say
so,
the
problem
of
which
i'm
sure
one
is
not
unsympathetic
if
you
are
about
to
discuss.would
you
mind
filling
in
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
if
possible
the
undisputed,
not
as
to
which
there
was
some
evidence
on
which
people
might
vary
a
different
judgment,
but
what
you
would
say
this
is
indisputably
what
the
setting
was,
what
her
condition
was,
the
interruption
or
want
of
interruption,
her
demand
for
help,
et
cetera,
et
cetera;
would
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
rights
was
she
told
she
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
appears
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
she
was
told,
"if
you
don't
want
to,
you
don't
have
to
say
another
word
till
you
get
a
lawyer."
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
so
vital
for
that.
i've
troubled
you
by
way
of
repetition
to
state
with
--
i
understand
you
correctly
that
she
was
asked
and
came
voluntarily
to
the
courtroom
as
the
place
for
examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
three
--
three
policemen
and
--
and
the
district
attorney
or
county
attorney,
that
she
was
told
at
the
beginning
that
if
she
chose
she
need
not
say
a
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
up
to
that
time
though
you've
indicted
the
questioning
was
about
--
not
really
relevant
to
--
to
a
confession
or
to
an
extraction
of
a
confession,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
she
was
then
told
what
her
rights
was
and
particularly
that
she
had
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
and
she
could
keep
her
mouth
shut,
keep
silent
if
she
chose
and
she
chose
--
and
if
she
chose
she
--
unless
she
had
a
lawyer
or
get
a
lawyer
and
that
she
declined
that
or
didn't
exercise
that
right
and
that
finally
she
made
substantially
a
full
disclosure
amounting
to
a
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
she
didn't
ask
for
a
lawyer
until
she
was
asked
where
she
got
the
strychnine
from
and
you
say
that
everything
that
she
said
after
she
asked
for
a
lawyer
was
scrupulously
excluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
correct
statement
to
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
the
record
would
clearly
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
thing
taken
down,
was
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
all
in
here
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
statement
about
which
justice
harlan
just
asked
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
actually
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
she
was
told,
"madam
or
mrs.
ashdown,
you
don't
have
to
say
a
word."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose
that's
not
a
contemporary
transcript,
it's
what
the
officers
testified
on
the
hearing,
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
was
whether
there
was
rather
for
present.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
because
8
days
will
seem
--
didn't
seem
important
but
in
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
--
of
the
fact
of
that
case
as
i
recall
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
--
that
the
crime
was
committed
elsewhere,
the
difficulty
with
that
situation
where
you
had
very
peculiar
set
of
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
put
this
question
and
i
would
understand
if
you
say
that
that
has
been
a
problem
for
me
to
put
to
you
but
to
put
ourselves,
suppose
this
court
where
to
reverse
this
case
or
this
court
ought
to
find
the
circumstances
was
such
that
within
our
opinion
we
think
this
exceeded
the
--
the
speed
limit
of
--
of
your
freedom.
what
would
be
the
effect
as
you
--
in
order
--
since
you
want
guidance,
what
--
what
would
this
do
to
you,
what
would
the
attorney
general
if
he
has
oversight
in
utah
or
the
prosecutors,
what
would
--
what
conclusions,
what
would
they
draw
from
it,
what
restrictions
would
they
feel
it
would
impose
that
shouldn't
be
imposed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
would
you
--
more
specifically,
i'm
pressing
you
because
--
because
i
appreciate
the
practicality
of
your
problem,
i
mean
on
the
one
hand,
you
got
--
after
all,
it
was
presumably
a
murder
committed
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
--
the
law
of
our
country
which
we
boast
is
that
guilty
people
must
be
brought
to
book
in
a
--
in
a
certain
way
so
that
guilt
isn't
the
answer.
what
--
what
restrictions
would
you
--
do
you
think
would
be
imposed?
would
you
--
suppose
we
--
suppose
we
reverse
as
we
have
done
in
cases,
we
cite
some
prior
cases
indicating
that
this
is
beyond
the
limit
of
--
of
due
process
without
making
much
elucidation,
would
you
say
well,
we
can't
have
a
lawyer,
we
can't
say
that
we
won't
examine
her.
you
would
say
that
was
unreasonable,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
even
suspicion,
you
would
say
it
was
unreasonable
for
this
court
to
say,
"well,
you
can't
--
once
you
suspect
a
person
you
can't
make
any
inquiry
of
him."
you
wouldn't
pick
that
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
pick
that
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
must
make
inquiry
in
order
to
let
an
innocent
person
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
say
"well,
two
hours
is
--
two
hours
may
sometimes
be
coercive,"
may
it
not?
one
hour
maybe
coercive
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
one
can
use
in
15
minutes
maybe
coercive.
that's
clearly
obvious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
probe
as
to
what
the
problems
are
that
you
say
we
have
to
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
the
admissibility
first
determined
by
the
trial
judge
before
it
went
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
chief
justice's
question
because
i
believe
your
answer
left
me
a
little
unclear.
as
i
understood
you
earlier,
you
said
that
after
some
preliminaries,
unimportant
from
your
point
of
view
about
family,
20
minutes
whatever
it
was,
she
was
then
told
that
she
need
not
say
another
word
without
having
a
lawyer
present,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
think
your
--
at
least
to
my
hearing,
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
was
a
little
obscure
there.
if
i
got
the
impression
that
you
thought
she
could
be
interrogated
without
a
lawyer
present
is
to
be
qualified,
that
if
she
chose
to
be
interrogated,
having
been
given
so
far
as
freedom
is
existent
this
will
--
the
freedom
to
keep
quiet,
she
then
went
on
her
own,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
only
that
but
she
didn't
--
you
do
not
impose
upon
a
person
in
her
situation
the
initiative
of
asking
for
one.
she
was
told
that
that
was
her
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
budge,
humpty
dumpty
is
off
my
mind
again,
may
i
see
if
i
can
restore
him
on
this
which
seems
to
me
crucial.
as
i
understand
that
this
woman
was
questioned
for
five-and-a-half
hours,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it,
you
said
that
for
the
first
20
minutes,
that's
neutrals.
that
really
doesn't
count
when
she
was
asked
this,
that
and
the
other
thing
about
family,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
whatever
it
is.
at
all
events
at
end
of
that
20
minutes,
she
was
told
according
to
the
record,
your
statement,
that
she
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
that
she
could
keep
quiet,
she
need
not
speak,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
did
speak
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
made
these
disclosures
up
to
4
o'clock
which
means
3
hours
and
40
minutes
of
questioning
which
was
accusatory
and
incriminating,
is
that
right?
after
she
was
told
that
she
had
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but,
anyhow
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
admitted,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
4
o'clock
--
well,
these
are
all
approximations
of
course,
at
4
o'clock
she
was
asked
where
she
got
the
strychnine,
where
she
bought
it
and
at
that
point
she
said
i
like
to
have
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
gave
all
this
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
at
4
o'clock
she
was
asked
where
bought
the
poison.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
she
obtained
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
obtained
it.
and
she
then
said
i
like
to
have
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
authorities
said,
"well,
you've
told
us
everything,
except
where
you
got
it."
and
that
your
supreme
court
said
that
up
to
the
time
that
she
demanded
counsel,
having
been
told
she
could
have
it
but
declined
to
have
it
or
not
asking
for
it,
that
is
admissible
but
it's
a
point
where
she
says
i
don't
want
a
--
i
want
now
a
lawyer,
from
thereon
it
couldn't
be
admitted,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
according
to
the
law
of
your
state
as
declared
by
your
court,
have
we
a
right
to
infer
or
are
we
even
under
duty
bound
to
infer
that
if
at
the
end
of
the
20
minutes,
if
after
--
after
this
neutral,
after
this
chit
chat
talk,
they
then
began
to
ask
serious
questions
introducing
it
with
an
assertion,
a
statement
to
her
of
her
rights.
she
said,
"well,
i
don't
want
to
say
a
word
and
i
want
a
lawyer."
if
they
said
then
you
can't
have
one
and
she
had
talked
the
way
she
had
talked,
would
that
confession
according
to
the
available
law
of
your
state,
would
that
have
been
admitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
base
that
on
the
decision
of
--
of
your
court
in
this
case
or
is
that
a
rule
of
law
in
utah?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
all
i
mean
to
say
is
are
there
decisions
in
utah
that
i
can
read
that
lead
me
--
that
would
require
me
to
be
confident
that
if
after
20
minutes
she
said
i
want
a
lawyer
and
they
then
have
denied
it,
the
--
the
confession
would
not
have
been
admitted.
i'm
--
i'm
asking
out
of
innocent
ignorance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
budge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
--
you
stated
with
appropriate
confidence,
you
put
a
title
to
it
as
i
assume
you
are,
that
if
she
had
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
they
said
no
you
can't
have
one,
that
that's
the
cutoff
time
that
nothing
would
have
been
admitted.
and
if
that's
the
law
of
utah
that's
very
vital
but
the
mere
fact
that
she
--
that
they
concluded
it
wasn't
coerce,
doesn't
give
us
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
a
failure
to
apprise,
to
tell
the
interrogated
person
what
his
rights
are?
in
other
words,
may
the
police
suspect
somebody,
take
him
to
whatever
they
take
him
to
and
begin
to
ply
with
question
for
hours
if
you
will.
never
tell
him
that
you
don't
have
to
talk
if
you
don't
want
to
talk,
you
may
get
a
lawyer
if
you
want
a
lawyer.
and
yet
allow
your
juries
to
find
that
that's
voluntary,
although
there's
an
explicit
absence
of
informing
the
questioned
person
that
he
has
any
rights
of
protection
of
that
kind.
that's
the
basic
thing
i
want
to
know
about
the
law
of
utah.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
crime
is
committed
and
they
--
they
pick
up
the
phrase,
i
believe,
they
pick
up
john
smith,
suspected
him.
may
they
then
take
him
to
police
headquarters
or
in
the
--
the
amenities
of
a
courtroom
and
ply
him
with
questions
for
five
hours
and
allow
the
jury
to
find
that
that
was
voluntary,
although
at
no
time
was
he
told,
but
if
he
chose,
he
could
keep
his
mouth
shut.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
very
crucial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
law
in
utah
on
that
subject
as
referred
in
your
brief,
that
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
a
preliminary
hearing
in
a
--
in
a
magistrate
or
whatever
you
call
it,
in
a
public
court,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whatever
i
may
think
about
that,
that's
a
different
question
from
this
i
think,
that
they
are
different
questions
that
this
court
has
not
to
yet
reached.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
by
way
of
curiosity,
is
it
the
custom?
is
it
usual
for
your
jury
in
case
of
finding
murder
to
recommend
life
imprisonment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
in
this
case.
what
i
want
to
know
is
there
a
general
tendency
for
juries
not
to
impose
a
death
sentence
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
there
isn't
evidence.
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
jury
wouldn't
find
her
guilty,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that
isn't
justice
brennan's
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you
turn
to
the
page
in
the
record
in
which
it
is
disclosed
that
she
was
advised,
that
she
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
state
and
read
exactly
what
it
is,
what
response,
if
any
she
made,
that
bearing
on
your
last
point
within
that
rust
case,
they
waive
it.
now
what
happened
here
exactly
at
page
57
--
page
57?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
on
the
first,
third
or
fourth
of
the
page,
you've
told
that
you
wanted
to
advise
(inaudible)
i
think
that
is
about
what
you
told
her.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me
--
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
contradicted
anywhere
in
the
record?
is
that
testimony
contradicted
anywhere?
did
you
--
did
you
put
any
witness
on
the
stand
or
in
cross-examination
in
a
contradictory
response?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
did
you
on
cross-examination
that
this
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
you
--
did
you
get
--
was
this
contradicting
what
you've
just
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
this
in
your
--
from
your
point
of
view,
from
your
rust
case?
never
mind
whether
--
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
the
rust
situation
and
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that
that
a
man
said,
“i
don't
want
a
lawyer”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
you
make
a
distinction
between
a
person
being
told,
but
you
must
accept
the
purpose
of
this
record
accurately
that
you're
entitled
of
a
lawyer,
you
didn't
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
being
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
being
told
that
they
know
i
don't
want
a
lawyer
and
the
person
being
told
and
standing
and
not
being
responsive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
make
a
distinction
between
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
constitutional
distinction
in
your
mind?
