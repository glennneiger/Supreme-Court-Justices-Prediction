mr.
walter
l.
budge
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
honorable
members
of
the
court.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
it
is
a
privilege
to
have
the
opportunity
of
appearing
before
the
court.
if
i
seem
a
little
nervous
it
will
be
because
i
am,
not
having
been
here
before.
briefly,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
too
much
in
dispute.
on
the
morning
of
the
5th
day
of
july,
mr.
ashdown
died
in
a
convulsing
seizure
in
the
doctor's
presence.
he
stated
to
the
doctor
that
he
had
--
had
some
lemon
juice
and
that
it
tasted
bitter.
later,
the
doctor
talked
with
mrs.
ashdown
and
she
told
him
that
she
had
given
her
husband
two
or
three
glasses
of
salt
water.
the
doctor
then
became
apparently
suspicious
and
he
immediately
contacted
the
authorities
and
they
came
over
and
they
questioned
mrs.ashdown
on
the
5th.
she
denied
at
all
times
that
she
had
poisoned
anyone
and
said
that
she
would
not
even
poison
a
rat.
subsequently,
the
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
--
it
was
in
response
to
questions,
your
honor,
of
the
officers.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
think
they
suspicioned
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
she
was
asked
by
the
officers
and
the
record
will
so
state
if
there
could
have
been
a
mistake
made
and
if
he
could
have
been
poisoned
and
that
was
on
the
5th
before
the
interrogation
on
the
9th.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
this
was
after
he
died.
the
officers
interrogated
her
and
the
body
was
removed
to
mortuary
and
then
the
officers
went
to
the
place
and
interrogated
mrs.
ashdown
at
the
home.
and
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
they
were
removed
the
following
day,
sometime
between
that
and
the
following
--
the
following
morning
they
were
taken
to
the
chemist
at
salt
lake
city
and
the
chemist
completed
his
analysis
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
8th
and
gave
the
report
back
and
the
exhibits
back
to
the
deputy
sheriff,
who
on
that
night
drove
them
back
to
cedar
city
which
is
a
distance
of
approximately
300
miles
from
salt
lake
city.
so
the
following
morning
--
i
mean
on
the
following
afternoon,
immediately
after
the
funeral,
they
asked
mrs.
ashdown
to
come
to
the
courthouse
where
she
was
interrogated
for
the
record
shows
five
and
one
half
hours
but
she
confessed
at
the
end
of
four
hours.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
that
that
was
routine
but
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
as
mr.
erickson
attempted
to
say,
it
didn't
come
out
in
the
record,
there
was
background
which
would
warrant
that
assumption
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
right.
it's
something
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
at
the
house,
it
was
not
very
long.
it
was
in
the
afternoon
and
of
course
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
don't
think
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
the
day
he
died,
i
don't
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
think
there's
any
record
--
anything
in
the
record
to
show
the
time
that
the
officers
were
there.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
from
the
--
i
would
just
estimate
from
--
from
the
cold
record
because
of
course
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
i
did
not
try
the
case
but
from
the
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
it
would
be
my
estimate
that
they
weren't
there
more
than
30
minutes
or
maybe
an
hour
if
--
at
the
hour.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
very
definitely
showed
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
mr.
justice
warren,
that
there
was
strychnine
in
the
body
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
and
that
that
was
the
cause
of
death.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
it
was
--
the
report
was
delivered
to
the
deputy
sheriff
who
took
it
to
the
sheriff
the
day
before
the
funeral.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
it
would
--
it
was
delivered
late
in
the
afternoon
and
he
drove
some
300
miles.
now,
whether
the
sheriff
got
it
early
the
next
morning
or
that
night,
i
don't
know,
but
there
was
a
sealed
report
from
the
chemist.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
she
said
that
--
she
testified
that
she
had
--
she
didn't
testify
anything
in
the
record.
she
said
to
the
doctor
that
she
had
given
him
salt
water,
i
guess
to
act
as
a
medic
or
something
to
make
him
disgorge
the
--
the
strychnine
or
the
lemon
juice,
that
would
be
my
--
the
way
i
would
understand
the
record
on
that.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
the
record
--
the
record
shows,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
police
visit
with
her
in
a
friendly
manner
and
their
suspicions
were
aroused,
but
it
doesn't
show
that
they
had
made
any
accusation
or
had
any
definite
proof
to
go
on
to
understanding
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no
restriction
on
her
liberty
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
right,
sir
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
and
there
was
no
restraint
at
that
time
she
was
not
charged
with
any
offense.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i'm
certain
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
that,
your
honor.
i
wish
they
did
have
a
suspicion,
there's
no
question
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
deciding
that
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
so.
they
went
in
the
kitchen
and
examined
the
dishes
which
were
all
dirty
on
the
sink
except
for
one
cup
which
had
been
recently
washed
and
which
they
asked
her
why
she
washed
that
single
cup
and
placed
it
on
of
the
top
the
dishes.
there
were
implications
that
could
be
drawn
even
from
--
and
as
i
say
from
the
background
besides
that.
and
i
don't
think,
your
honors,
that
we
are
particularly
at
loggerheads
over
the
facts,
i
think
the
facts
are
clear.
i
think
the
fundamental
problem
that
we
are
now
presented
with
is
merely
what
may
a
state
officer
do
in
interrogating
a
witness
suspected
of
an
offense
in
the
absence
of
counsel?
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
the
record
shows
that
she
was
requested
her
brother
or
her
--
some
relative
of
the
family
was
requested
by
the
sheriff
to
have
her
report
to
the
courthouse
and
she
did
in
the
company
with
her
sister.
and
at
the
courthouse
there
was
these
three
police
officers
and
the
district
attorney
for
that
district
of
utah.
and
they
took
her
upstairs
into
the
courtroom
itself,
as
i
understand
the
record
says,
and
they
refused
to
let
the
sister
come
in.
they
interrogated
mrs.
ashdown
in
the
courtroom
for
the
period
stated,
five-and-a-half
hours.
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
hour,
she
confessed.
she
was
repeatedly
told
by
the
officers
that
they
didn't
want
her
to
confess
to
anything
she
didn't
do,
numerous
times
the
record
shows.
the
first
part
of
the
questioning
was
merely
nothing,
apparently
more
than
a
visit
about
family
affairs
and
one
thing
and
another.
and
then
she
was
advised
of
her
rights
by
the
district
attorney,
her
sister
was
not
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
she
was
told
that
she
had
the
right
to
counsel
and
that
she
didn't
have
to
saying
anything
if
she
didn't
want
to.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
she
had
the
right
to
demand
counsel
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
and
she
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
when
she
asked
for
a
lawyer,
the
sheriff
said
to
her,
"well,
it's
too
late
now.
you've
told
us
everything
except
one
thing,
where
did
you
get
the
strychnine?"
and
our
court
very
carefully
and
deliberately,
the
trial
court
refused
to
let
one
word
of
testimony
into
the
record
or
before
the
jury
that
was
produced
after
she
had
asked
for
counsel.
our
supreme
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
--
that's
all
the
record
show.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
the
record
shows,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
it
was
not
right
at
the
beginning,
that
it
was
some
20
minutes
or
maybe
30
minutes
after.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
sir,
that's
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that
is
what
the
record
will
bear,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
don't
--
i
haven't
marked
that.
i
haven't
anticipated
but
the
--
all
of
the
sheriff's
officials,
all
three
of
them
testified
as
to
that
at
one
place
or
another.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
the
--
the
entire
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
the
--
no,
the
confession?
mr.
walter
l.
budge
oh,
the
transcript?
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
in
the
record,
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
she
was
advised
as
to
her
right
to
counsel.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
that's
--
yes,
that's
--
that's
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
i
misunderstood.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
there
was
no
testimony
by
mrs.
ashdown
in
her
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
she
did
not
take
the
stand
to
testify.
only
outside
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
mrs.
ashdown
testified
to
the
court,
outside
in
the
presence
of
jury.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
she
testified
--
yes,
sir,
as
to
what
was
told
her
in
the
courtroom
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
during
the
--
during
the
interrogation.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
there
is
some
controversy
in
the
testimony.
there
is
some
difference
as
to
what
she
said
and
what
the
officers
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
page
80
--
starting
on
page
83
is
the
testimony
of
the
witness.
and
the
only
controversy
as
i
see
it
in
here
is
--
was
what
she
said
the
prosecutor
told
her
during
the
interrogation
as
to
what
had
happened
to
him
in
an
event
in
europe
when
he
was
accused
of
--
he
said
killing
five
men
and
he
talked
to
the
investigating
officers
and
they
helped
him
and
he
was
not
convicted.
and
he
was
advising
her
there
that
it
might
be
well
for
her
to
cooperate
and
if
there
were
--
was
a
mistake
made
to
tell
him
how
it
could've
been
made.
now,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
she
was
sobbing
and
weeping
at
times
during
the
interrogation
and
that
she
could
be
heard
from
outside
the
room.
but
our
court
in
its
specific
findings
found
that
there
was
no
such
coercion
or
threats
or
promises
of
immunity
as
would
invade
her
constitutional
rights.
now,
getting
back
to
what
we
feel
the
question
is
and
we
don't
feel
we
can
be
followed
anymore
by
stein
versus
new
york
or
stroble
versus
california
or
the
gallegos
case.
we
feel
the
answer
we
have
to
seek
from
this
court
is
what
can
the
state
do
and
its
officers
in
interrogating
a
witness
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
where
is
the
line
to
be
drawn
from
here
on
out?
in
the
gallegos
case,
you
may
recall
there
were
some
eight
days
of
extensive
questioning
and
at
that
time
the
court
said
--
this
court
said
that
that
did
not
make
an
infirmity
such
as
what
abridged
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
--
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
think
the
court
said
the
reason
he
confessed
there
was
probably
because
of
his
conscience.
i
think
that
that
was
a
different
situation.
but
we
feel
--
from
the
state
of
utah,
we
feel
that
that
is
the
question,
i
don't
think
there's
any
controversy
gentlemen
--
justices
in
the
facts,
i
think
that
we
are
substantially
in
--
in
terms
in
both
of
our
briefs
with
what
the
actual
facts
are.
but
the
fundamental
issue
as
we
see
it
and
which
we
ask
this
court
to
guide
us
upon
is
put
to
the
question
that
i
had
just
asked
before
it.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
that
all
they
found
upon
the
opinion
of
the
courts,
your
honor
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
but
we
would
probably
invite
or
attempt
to
inform
our
officers
and
our
prosectors
as
to
what
they
should
and
should
not
do
in
order
that
we
can
avoid
such
unfortunate
experience
such
as
this
where
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
of
guilt
and
where
there
is
evidence
outside
of
the
confession
that
in
all
probability
would
sustain
a
conviction.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
i
would
--
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
practical
because
we
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
we
can't
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
completely
tie
the
--
the
hands
of
the
officers.
we
have
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
right.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
think
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
sir,
you're
right.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
think
it
may
be
influenced
to
some
extent
by
the
brass
and
sullivan
case
that
came
from
utah
in
which
this
court
refused
to
grant
certiorari
upon
it.
in
that
case,
the
federal
district
court
held
that
they
were
entitled
a
release
because
they
did
not
have
counsel
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings,
that
they
didn't
have
counsel
immediately
upon
their
arrest,
that
they
should
be
discharged.
now,
that's
our
problem,
there's
no
--
i
think
in
examining
this
record,
your
honor,
there's
no
evidence
at
all
of
any
coercion
or
threats
or
force
or
violence.
i
--
i
think
that
--
with
the
understanding
of
the
law
as
i
have
known
it
until
now
that
there
was
no
violation
of
any
constitutional
right.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
--
my
contention
and
what
i
feel
is
that
the
examination
they
gave
her
without
counsel,
mr.
justice
warren,
was
not
violative
of
her
constitutional
rights.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
in
the
absence
of
her
requesting
it,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
what
i
argue
(voice

--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
our
supreme
court.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
her
father
and
an
uncle
came
and
asked
to
get
in,
but
i
don't

mr.
walter
l.

that
was
the
sheriff.
told
him
that
there
was
a
lawyer
in
there
with
her
to
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
advise
her
of
her
right.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
the
--
the
district
attorney
was
in
there
and
he
did
advise
her.
mr.
walter
l.

he
was
in
there
and
he
did
advise
her
of
her
rights,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
she
was
advised
that
she
could
have
a
--
she
--
upon
request
she
could
have
a
lawyer
and
then
everything
that
she
said
could
be
used
against
her
and
that
she
might
remain
silent.
that
is
the
substance
of
what
she
told.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
i
mean
in
the
absence
of
her
asking
for
counsel
that
the
interrogation
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
mean
to
say,
your
honor,
she
might
not
have
gotten
a
lawyer
at
the
time
of
the
examination,
but
if
she
had
not
that
our
utah
court
would
not
let
any
evidence
obtained
from
her
in
after
she
asked
for
an
attorney.
if
she
would
have
asked
for
an
attorney
at
the
outset,
i
don't
know
what
the
officers
would
have
done.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
i
don't
think
that,
your
honor,
is
exactly
--
pardon
me
--
exactly
the
interpretation
that
i
would
put
on
it.
pardon
me.
the
district
attorney
advised
her
of
her
constitutional
rights
and
then
she
went
on
freely
without
asking
for
counsel
and
told
them
what
had
happened.
and
then
she
said
well
now,
i
--
she
said
i
think
i
should
have
counsel.
and
they
said
there
is
no
need
of
counsel
now
because
you've
told
us
you
poisoned
your
husband
and
you've
told
us
everything
except
where
you
got
the
poison.
well,
when
the
court
below
heard
this
matter
up
to
the
point
that
she
asked
for
counsel,
they
let
the
evidence
in,
beyond
that
they
let
nothing
in.
now,
it
would
seem
that
officers,
if
they
have
reasonable
suspicions,
can
question
without
counsel,
providing
of
course
that
they
use
a
reasonable
means
and
do
so
without
coercion
and
without
threats
and
without
imposing
upon
the
rights
of
the
individual.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
it
--
i
think
if
they
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
have
a
right
to
inquire,
to
attempt
to
uncover
a
crime.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
but
it
--
but
it
follows
that
anything
they
obtain
from
a
witness
in
that
manner,
mr.
justice
warren,
would
not
be
admissible
in
our
courts.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
if
she'd
made
her
election
there,
i'm
sure
that
the
district
attorney
would've
known
enough
to
quit
questioning
her
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
right
there.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
i
wouldn't
say
in
any
manner
they
desire,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
as
long
as
she
was
willing
to
converse
and
to
tell
them
what
took
place
before
asking
for
counsel,
that
that
would
be
perfectly
legitimately
obtained
information
for
the
trial.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
they
denied
counsel.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
when
she
suggested
that
she
would
like
counsel,
they
said,
"well,
you've
told
us
everything,
now
you've
told
us
the
truth
and
all
you
haven't
told
us
is
where
you
got
the
strychnine."
there
is
no
need
of
counsel
and
she
made
no
further
request
or
demand,
she
didn't
say
i
know,
but
i
still
want
counsel.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
they
found
out
nothing
after
that.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that
is
right,
she
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
for
two
or
an
hour-and-a-half
after
that
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
can't
answer
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
counsel
up
to
that
point
where
she
was
--
where
the
--
after
--
until
after
she
confessed,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
think
-
i
think
i
understand
your
question,
your
--
your
honor.
i
think
i
understand
what
you're
driving
at
but
i
don't
know
whether
i've
got
my
point
across
to
you,
that
what
i
think
is
that
if
they
had
made
that
refusal
at
any
earlier
time,
her
constitutional
rights
would
have
been
fully
protected
in
the
proceedings
in
our
court
because
the
minute
she
made
the
request,
our
court
cut
--
drew
the
line
there
and
her
written
confession,
which
she
signed
the
next
day,
never
appeared
because
they
--
they
cut
it
off.
now,
that's
in
the
record,
that's
clearly
in
the
record.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
71
of
the
record?
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
sir.
and
that's
referring
to
the
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
the
written
confession
that
was
written
out.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
have
the
right
page
at
71,"if
you
have
a
question,
you
will
correct
that
now
that
she
was
not
advised
of
her
rights
to
have
counsel
and
her
constitutional
rights
until
about
25
minutes
after
you
questioned
her?"
after,
yes,
that
during
the
questioning
and
that
is
what
i
have
said
here
that
the
first
20
or
25
minutes
she
was
not
advised.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
this
--
that
refers
to
the
subsequent
confession
that
was
made
in
writing
the
following
day,
the
next
morning
and
this
evidence
that
you're
reading
here
is
--
was
not
presented
to
the
jury.
this
was
presented
to
the
court
to
establish
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
it
was
not
introduced
and
did
not
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
what
the
record
would
indicate
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
of
her
constitutional
rights,
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
think
a
good
part
of
it
was
accusatory
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
she
was
--
first
--
she
first
said
that
she
poisoned
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
mr.
ashdown.
yes,
and
then
they
asked
her
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
where
she
obtained
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
right.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
i
should
not
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
that's
what
the
district
court
held
and
did
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
none
of
it
would
have
been
admitted,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
it
would
be
an
involuntary
confession
if
we
would
take
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
i
may
not
be
able
to
intelligently
reply,
your
honor,
but
i'll
try.
that
the
opinion
of
our
court
merely
holds
that
the
--
the
fact
that
she
was
questioned
in
the
absence
of
counsel
and
by
the
officers
in
the
manner
she
was
questioned
did
not
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
did
not
show
the
--
the
confession
itself
was
involuntary.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
thank
you.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
your
question
without
proper
thought
--
saved
by
the
bell.
i
think
the
law
in
the
state
of
utah
is
that
you
can
--
a
police
officer
can
and
may
interrogate
a
witness
whether
or
not
they
have
asked
for
a
lawyer.
so
long
as
they
do
it
in
a
proper
manner
consistent
with
procedural
due
process
and
the
guarantees
of
the
constitution,
i
would
rely
upon
the
case
of
rust
and
sullivan.
the
utah
decision
cited
in
my
brief
for
that
proposition.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
and
then
they
have
the
reasonable
basis
for
suspicion.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no.
that
wouldn't
be
what
i
am
trying
to
say.
no
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
if
there
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
in
the
rust
and
sullivan
case,
mr.
callister
refreshes
my
(inaudible)
rust
and
sullivan
case,
they
didn't
have
counsel
until
after
the
order
of
--
informed
against
--
although
it
had
asked
for
a
counsel.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
in
this
case,
that's
a
matter
of
fact
--
that's
what
the
judge
did.
he
was
overcautious
maybe
in
protecting
the
woman's
right
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
law
in
utah.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
as
i
understand
it
would
be
the
law
in
utah.
that
the
mere
refusal
of
counsel,
when
requested
by
a
police
officer
would
not
be
per
se
an
infringement
upon
the
constitutional
right,
that
the
court
would
still
want
to
know,
the
reviewing
court
would
still
want
to
know
how
that
it
--
that
was
--
how
the
information
was
obtained
and
whether
the
--
it
was
coercion
or
threat
or
anything
in
that.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
there
would
be
no
value
but
if
he
elects
not
to
exercise
his
rights,
then
the
court
will
--
i
mean
the
matter
doesn't
make
it
per
se
a
--
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
guarantee,
but
if
he
demands
that
he
wants
a
lawyer
and
they
--
they
refused
to
let
him
have
one,
the
court
will
certainly
look
at
that
in
the
light
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
a
--
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
by
what
the
--
by
the
refusal.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
no,
i
think
that
--
that
the
utah
supreme
court
said
that
was
a
better
practice,
but
i
don't
think
they
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
we
have
the
rust
and
sullivan
case
where
they
asked
for
an
attorney
and
that
case
went
to
utah
supreme
court
also
to
the
federal
courts
after
the
tenth
circuit
and
this
court
refuses
certiorari
in
the
case.
well,
in
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
that
case,
they
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
they
weren't
provided
counsel
until
after
the
arraignment.
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
even
provided
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
and
our
court
--
mr.
walter
l.
budge
--
sustained
their
conviction.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
yes,
yes.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
well,
it's
--
it's
my
personal
view,
your
honor,
that
an
officer
may
do
so,
and
that
if
he
is
denied
the
right
to
do
so,
that
most
crimes
or
murders
premeditated
at
least
will
go
unsolved.
and
so,
i
feel
that
the
officer
should
be
able
to
interrogate
even
though
the
counsel
has
requested
it.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
walter
l.
budge
thank
you.
