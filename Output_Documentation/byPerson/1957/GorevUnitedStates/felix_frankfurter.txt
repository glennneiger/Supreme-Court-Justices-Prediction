justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
boggs
act
at
all
relevant
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
raise
the
question
or
is
it
relevant
to
your
problem
as
you
conceded
to
consider
the
problem
that
was
--
that
was
in
part
of
the
decision
this
morning,
namely,
accepted
not
conjoined
prosecution
or
in
case
of
guilt
or
in
case
of
innocence,
finding
an
acquittal
by
the
jury.is
that
relevant
to
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
any
of
them.
my
question
merely
was
whether
they're
involved
in
any
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
--
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
you're
overtime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
rightly
infer
as
--
i
just
want
a
statement
and
not
argument
that
if
congress
had
said
in
term
and
for
each
one
of
these
offenses
though
--
though
committed
by
a
single
transaction,
the
court
may
or
indeed
it
shall
be
excluded
to
impose
a
separate
punishment.
we're
not
challenging
that
as
to
constitutionality
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
the
congress
anticipate
the
suspension
of
petition
of
yours
as
to
what
the
boggs
act
implies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
thinking
of
ratification.
i
was
wondering
if
the
silence
of
congress
carries
greater
weight
of
--
if
you
lose
position
in
the
silence
of
this
court
or
arguments
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assume
and
probably
the
fact
that
they
didn't
think
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
if
a
fellow
is
indicted,
defendant
is
indicted
under
two
counts.
the
first
count
for
selling
unlawful
in
march
1958.
he
is
indicted
in
the
second
count
but
didn't
pay
tax
in
april
19
--
suppose
one
of
the
other
brief.
now,
under
the
boggs,
in
the
present
situation,
what
punishment
do
you
urge
within
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
impose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
one
sentence
as
a
one
--
as
of
one
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
in
the
blockburger
there
wouldn't
--
he
couldn't
come
under
boggs
and
you
reject
blockburger
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
it
would
--
there
would
be
just
one
sentence,
although
they
are
a
different
theory
because
to
say
fundamentally
all
this
statute
had
just
one
objective.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
put
to
you
--
may
i
put
to
you
my
difficulty.
you
seem
to
emphasize
and
find
--
derived
great
strength
from
the
legislative
history
indicating
that
all
three
statutes
involved
or
directed
towards
the
same
--
against
the
same
evil.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
when
the
narcotics
act
--
harrison
act
--
i
haven't
looked
at
this
and
you
tell
me
quickly
if
i'm
wrong.
it's
my
recollection
that
that
--
the
constitutionality
of
that
was
attacked
in
part
because
it
was
claimed
that
under
the
guise
of
a
taxing
statute
you're
really
passing
a
police
act.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
it
wasn't
some
esoteric
knowledge
that
you
will
properly
deny
to
this
court
in
knowing
that
all
these
--
all
these
enactments
were
against
the
narcotics
traffic.
what
is
--
what
is
there
so
emphatic
in
your
mind
bearing
upon
this
question?
that
namely
that
all
three
statutes
of
a
different
board
of
congress
was
attacking
it
form
three
different
ways
then
making
three
different
transactions,
three
distinct
offenses
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
argument
would
be
of
no
avail
if
you
were
prosecuted
for
that.
you
wouldn't
be
here
i
take
it
in
urging
that
this
isn't
really
a
revenue
measure
because
it
wasn't
intended
to
be
a
revenue
measure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
just
like
the
old
--
a
lot
of
cases,
and
so
you
don't
have
to
go
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
call
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases,
they
all
had
an
element
--
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
again.
if
i'm
wrong,
you'll
correct
me.
they
all
had
an
element
of
a
different
--
of
a
--
of
a
continuity
of
conduct
rather
than
an
isolated
discreet
instance,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
emphasized
in
the
bell
case
that
transportation
was
the
thing,
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
six
women
at
once
or
two.
in
c.i.t
there
was
also
not
a
question
of
not
--
i
forgot
what
was
that
--
entry
or
not
entry
invoked
one
of
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
related
to
the
system
of
keeping
books
or
not
keeping
books.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
that
all
unit
of
prosecutions
can't
be
clubbed
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
duty
that
was
cast
upon
the
employer
is
to
keep
books.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
against
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
questioning
you
because
i'm
very
sympathetic
with
your
general
position
as
you
know
from
my
opinion.
but
i
should
think
there's
a
difference
in
putting
that
burden
on
the
congress
when
it
passes
an
act
on
may
19,
1958.
as
again
saying
that
when
it
passed
an
act
in
1909
to
throttle
or
at
least
to
curve
the
narcotic
statute,
that's
the
purpose.
well
that
didn't
do
it
until
1914.
they
passed
another
statute
to
deal
with
the
same
evil.
that
didn't
do
it
and
in
1919
they
passed
another
statute.
and
what
you're
saying
the
inference
is
that
these
three
different
statutes
directed
against
the
great
evil,
passed
a
different
time,
having
different
subject
matter
or
content
of
crime,
in
each
case,
the
court
--
the
congress
implied
that
we
absorb
what
preceded
and
they
did
a
single
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument,
really.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
one
transaction
necessarily
violate
all
these
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that
since
you
answer
is
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
your
argument
lead
to
the
conclusion
--
would
that
lead
in
the
direction
of
saying
that
congress
couldn't
say
if
all
three
proscribed
acts
are
committed.
if
only
one
is
then
the
punishment
is
five
years,
if
all
three
then
the
punishment
shall
be
15.
in
other
words,
this
elaborate
argument
may
--
all
that
it
may
lead
to
is
a
different
scale
of
punishments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
goes
to
the
reach
of
your
--
your
double
jeopardy
point.
if
congress
can
deal
with
this
situation,
it
will
reach
exactly
the
same
result
by
a
different
scale
of
punishment,
then
where
are
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
reach
the
eighth
amendment
much
earlier
the
most
because
i'm
against
heavy
sentences,
but
that's
a
different
problem.
