ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
blockburger
was
decided
in
1932
and
it
was
not
a
unique
case.
it's
followed
by
a
number
of
decisions
from
this
field
before
and
number
of
decisions
after.
and
they
all
seem
to
me
quite
consistent
in
the
point
of
view
which
i
don't
think
has
been
changed
by
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
as
the
--
i
don't
think
the
particular
factor
that
i
think
is
the
keystone
to
all
these
decisions,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
been
affected
by
it.
and
what
i
think
that
is,
is
this,
what
the
court
said
in
blockburger
what
it
said
in
albrecht,
which
blockburger
started
was
that
when
we're
discussing
the
intent
of
congress
in
creating
offenses,
the
question
is
what
was
the
congressional
purpose?
what
was
congress
trying
to
accomplish
when
it
outlawed
certain
behavior?
and
in
judging
the
congressional
intent,
we
start
with
the
way
congress
legislates
in
general,
not
for
joe
doe
and
not
for
any
particular
set
of
facts
that
might
happen
to
occur.
but
what
was
the
particular
that
congress
prohibited?
and
if
congress
intended
to
punish
two
different
things
in
the
blockburger
case,
selling
without
a
written
order
form
and
in
the
other
offense
selling
without
the
stamps
right
on
the
narcotics,
so
you
can
tell
whether
they
are
legitimate
or
not.
if
congress
said
doing
each
one
of
these
things
is
the
fair
thing
that
we
think
should
be
punished
and
if
these
two
things
can
be
different,
then
as
far
as
congress
is
concerned
they're
subject
to
two
separate
punishments.
and
i
think
that
if
you
go
through
all
the
decisions
of
the
court,
you'll
see
that
that
is
the
keystone.
it's
true
that
more
recently
the
intent
of
congress
has
been
interpreted
perhaps
a
little
more
broadly.
but
it's
always
been
what
was
the
act
that
congress
punished
and
not
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
defendant
when
he
did
those
things.
if
congress
said,
you
shouldn't
do
two
things
then
the
punishment
placed
can
be
for
the
two
things
that
congress
meant.
let
me
at
this
moment
say
that
i
think
we
don't
gain
much
in
this
case
by
talking
about
double
jeopardy
because
it
seems
to
me
at
least
double
jeopardy
in
the
context
of
retrial,
because
the
problems
are
different
as
this
court's
opinion
in
hoag
states
although
generally,
the
court
has
not
bothered
to
make
that
distinction.
there
is
no
doubt,
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
absolutely
no
constitutional
problem
that
if
congress
had
said,
you
shall
not
sell
unlawfully
imported
narcotics,
if
you
do
so,
you'll
be
subject
to
apply
the
penalty.
if
in
that
sale
you
also
leave
out
order
forms,
there
shall
be
five-year
additional
penalty
and
if
in
that
sale
you
don't
put
in
stamps,
there
will
be
an
additional
five-year
penalty.
they
had
done
that
at
one
time
in
absolutely
unmistakable
language.
there
wouldn't
be
any
constitutional
question
whatsoever.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
if
they
had
done
it
exactly
that
way,
if
a
man
was
either
convicted
or
acquitted
of
that
one
sale,
there
wouldn't
be
any
doubt
that
you
couldn't
reach
wrong
and
there
is
because
it
would
be
the
same
offense.
so
that
i
think
what
the
purpose
of
this
case
where
all
we're
dealing
with
is
punishment.
it's
fair
to
concern
ourselves
to
the
question
of
how
do
we
decide
what
it
is
that
congress
has
made
the
subject
of
punishment
and
our
--
that
the
approach
--
now,
what
the
approach
of
the
court
in
blockburger,
in
albrecht,
in
burton,
later
on
in
michener
was
we
look
at
what
congress
said
you
shouldn't
do.
did
congress
have
a
reason
for
that?
if
it
did,
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
whether
in
a
particular
case,
under
a
particular
set
of
facts
that
was
done
by
one
act
or
two
closely
related
act,
the
point
is
you've
done
two
things
that
congress
said
you
shouldn't
do
and
therefore
you're
subject
to
the
punishment
for
not
doing
those
two
things.
now,
blockburger
recognize
this
quite
explicitly.
the
other
decisions
i
think
more
implicitly,
they
don't
say
so
that
the
particular
facts
to
the
particular
case
in
the
close
relationship
of
the
offenses
to
each
other.
a
large
problem
for
the
sentencing
judge
or
some
of
them
sentencing
is
a
matter
which
is
presently
under
consideration
by
congress,
leaves
the
sub-committee
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
has
mentioned
as
one
of
the
subjects
to
think
worthy
of
further
study
of
the
matter
of
disparity
in
sentencing
in
the
federal
court
and
that
is
possible.
but
that
is
the
problem.
it's
a
sentencing
problem
and
is
not
essentially
one
of
the
definitions
of
the
offenses
or
of
double
jeopardy.
and
i
think
perhaps
the
most
vivid
illustration
of
how
the
matter
of
approach
are,
can
in
effect
in
a
sense
effectively
so,
is
that
the
--
you
will
compare
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
michener
against
the
united
states.
with
the
short
opinion
of
this
court,
we've
reasoned
it.
in
michener
against
the
united
states
this
court,
the
eighth
circuit
said,
what
we
agreed
that
possessing
a
counterfeit
plate
and
causing
a
counterfeit
plate
to
be
made
can
sometimes
be
two
different
offenses.
but
in
this
particular
case
the
indictment
charge
possession
at
exactly
the
same
time,
the
same
place
as
the
charge
of
the
making
and
the
government
conceded
that
the
making
and
the
possession
were
coextensive.
so
we
think
in
this
case
you
can't
have
separate
punishment.
this
court
reversed
in
a
very
short
per
curiam
citing
gavieres,
and
albrecht,
and
blockburger.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
analyze
those
cases
and
what
they
held,
albrecht
was
the
case
under
prohibition,
where
there
was
one
sentence
for
possession
and
one
sentence
for
sale
of
liquor.
no
question
there
that
what
congress
was
aiming
was
the
unitary
purpose
outlawing
illicit
sale
of
liquor.
no
question
there
of
justifying
on
any
limited
theory
of
federal
jurisdiction,
the
federal
government
head
up
to
the
power
drawing
prohibition.
the
point
was
justice
brandeis
said
in
his
opinion
was
possession
is
something
congress
want
to
prohibit,
sale
is
something
congress
want
to
prohibit.
possession
and
sale
can
in
general
be
different.
the
fact
that
they
happen
to
be
together
in
this
case,
that
doesn't
make
the
offenses
the
same.
it's
for
the
judge
to
decide
whether
on
a
particular
fact
consecutive
sentences
are
warranted
or
what
--
or
they
were
not,
and
that
i
take
it
is
what
the
court
was
saying
in
blockburger.
and
the
considerations
that
led
the
court
to
that
opinion
are
just
as
valid
today
as
they
were
then
and
are
just
as
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
now,
blockburger
cites,
nigro
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
the
court
read
its
prior
decision.
if
you're
looking
at
the
decision
in
nigro
which
is
quoted
extensively
on
pages
21
to
22
of
our
brief.
i
think
you
will
see
that
the
court
was
completely
aware
of
the
purpose
of
the
narcotic
laws
to
outlaw
illegal
sale
and
that
they
were
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
each
was
in
a
sense
a
step
towards
outlawing
the
ultimate
evil.
and
if
you
read
blockburger
as
against
the
background
of
nigro
and
as
against
the
background
of
all
the
other
cases
that
had
been
decided
before
that,
burton
and
albrecht.
there's
a
per
curiam
called
king
against
the
united
states
decided
just
before
blockburger
which
involved
one
offense
as
selling
one
of
--
morphine
and
another
of
shipping
the
same
morphine
in
interstate
commerce.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
blockburger
was
written
in
any
unawareness
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
you
look
at
the
statute
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
had
very
specific
things
in
mind
by
each
of
these
statutes.
the
first
was
passed
in
1909
and
it
was
originally
just
an
import
tax
are
of
--
a
prohibition
against
importation
and
against
dealing
in
imported
products.
well,
very
soon,
congress
found
that
wasn't
sufficient
because
once
the
narcotics
had
come
in,
it
found
no
way
to
trace
them
federally.
if
they
had
come
and
couldn't
separate
the
illegal
from
the
legal
narcotics
and/or
control
thereafter
importation
disappeared
unless
you
actually
found
them
the
man
--
the
man
could
show
that
he
knew
they
had
been
illegally
imported.
and
so
in
1914,
congress
passed
the
statute
requiring
the
written
order
form.
now,
this
is
an
extremely
important
statute
in
the
enforcement
of
the
narcotic
laws
because
that's
the
one
by
which
legitimate
narcotics
or
trade
from
their
entry
into
the
country,
right
down
through
the
wholesaler
to
the
jobber,
to
the
retailer,
to
the
pharmacist.
as
a
matter
of
fact
anything
peculiar
about
written
order
forms
will
immediately
start
an
investigation.
and
so,
for
example
if
a
druggist
or
a
doctor
is
suddenly
showing
up
with
too
many
order
forms,
that's
the
basis
for
investigation.
that
shows
up
in
the
direct
sale
case
of
this
court
in
319
and
was
a
subject
testimony
in
1956
by
the
commission
of
narcotics
explaining
the
importance
of
the
order
form
in
controlling
domestic
traffic.
but
even
that
didn't
prove
sufficient
because
narcotics
are
sometimes
stolen.
narcotics
are
sometimes
obtained
illegitimately
from
doctors
and
so
on.
and
secondly,
of
course
the
illegitimate
trade
wasn't
paying
any
taxes.
and
so
in
1919,
congress
held
the
third
provision
which
asks
for
a
stamp
right
on
the
narcotics.
well,
there
are
two
purposes.
in
the
first
place,
it
identified
the
narcotics
immediately
without
checking
on
order
forms
as
legitimate
or
illegitimate.
and
in
the
second
place,
it
was
a
way
of
making
clear
of
getting
taxes
from
the
illegitimate
business
so
that
to
that
extent
there
was
a
revenue,
one
indefinite
revenue
purpose
to
the
measure.
now,
that's
what
blockburger
was
decided
and
that's
what
was
really
the
decision
when
the
court
said
that
each
of
the
sections
of
the
harrison
narcotics
act
continue
a
separate
crime.
and
as
for
congress
--
the
only
thing
congress
has
shown
the
least
interest
in
changing
about
blockburger.
well,
it
has
not
specifically
mentioned
blockburger,
let
me
say
that.
but
the
only
thing
that
congress
had
been
interested
in
doing
with
respect
to
setting
thing
in
narcotic
cases
is
to
make
certain
that
the
minimum
are
heavy.
now,
that
--
above
that
the
one
--
the
great
subject
to
discussion
in
the
hearings
and
on
the
floor
of
congress
was
that
the
sentences
imposed
by
federal
judges
were
too
low.
they
had
statistics
to
the
effect
that
the
average
they
intend
was
23
months.
this
--
whether
it
was
the
first
offender
or
not
and
what
the
real
interest
in
the
boggs
act
was
doing
was
to
make
certain
there
was
a
dealer.
but
this
court
had
said
in
blockburger
if
what
we
have
decided
is
too
harsh,
it's
for
congress
to
change
it.
there's
absolutely
no
indication
that
i
can
say
that
congress
was
interested
in
changing
this
doctrine
which
wasn't
confined
to
blockburger
that
each
of
this
offenses
were
separate
or
that
each
prohibition
by
congress
was
a
subject
to
a
separate
punishment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
indications
of
congressional
control
in
the
event
of
congressional
intent
in
the
boggs
act,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
in
a
direction
of
reaffirming
blockburger
because
the
court
separately
amended
the
export-import
control
act.
the
court
separately
amended
the
house
in
narcotics
act
and
whereas
the
boggs
--
the
harrison
act
originally
had
said
for
any
violation
of
this
act
there
shall
be
a
punishment.
and
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
base
an
argument
for
a
single
punishment
on
that
radiology
in
blockburger.
the
boggs
act
changed
that
to
read
for
any
offense,
the
punishment
shall
be
minimum
and
maximum,
i
think
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
i
read
the
bell
and
the
c.i.t.
cases,
your
honor,
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
philosophy
that
you
look
to
what
it
is
that
congress
hunched
and
i
think
that
they
do
show
attends
the
--
to
interpret
that
general
intent
more
broadly.
and
so,
i
say
that
there's
a
different
field
for
example
in
bell
and
c.i.t.
than
there
is
in
the
mailbag
case
where
the
court
said
any
mailbag
--
any
mailbag
means
if
you
cut
six
(inaudible)
offense,
i
think
the
stress
in
bell
is
on
cutting
or
destroying.
but
i
don't
see
that
the
bell
cases
have
reached
the
question
of
--
if
congress
had
a
general
object
in
mind,
i
don't
read
them
as
adopting
for
instance
anything
like
a
single
transaction
test.
i
don't
read
them
as
saying
we
decide
what
congress
meant
by
trying
to
figure
out
or
what
would
congress
have
wanted
if
it
had
this
particular
case
before
it.
for
instance,
these
statutes
don't
mean
--
don't
all
relate
necessarily
to
sale
as
sale.
the
one
statute
involved
in
this
case
prohibit
the
transportation
concealment
facilitating
the
transportation
and
sale
of
unlawfully
imported
narcotics.
i
don't
quite
understand
mr.
rauh's
argument
to
this
degree,
is
he
going
to
say
that,
well,
it's
one
offense,
it
merges
in
the
sale
if
--
or
you
approved
to
sale.
but
if
we
show
that
he
transported
it
and
we
think
we
did
in
this
case,
that
then
becomes
one
offense
or
two
offenses.
secondly,
the
purchase,
the
stamp
requirement
prohibits
unstamped
narcotics
purchased
or
sale.
it
isn't
sale,
it's
the
unstamped
part
of
it
that's
just
to
that
effect,
and
that's
different
from
the
unlawful
importation.
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
written
order
form
has
--
well,
it
relates
to
sale
as
such
has
a
purpose,
that's
different
from
the
stamp
purpose.
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
real
regulatory
purpose.
you
need
--
the
government
needs
those
order
forms
to
keep
track
of
what's
going
on.
so
that
--
well,
the
more
recent
cases
tend
that
there
are
more
possible
within
one
statute
to
interpret
the
general
intent
more
favorably
to
a
defendant
than
has
been
done.
i
don't
read
them
as
going
back
from
this
--
well
i
consider
the
general
approach
of
all
these
cases.
that
if
the
general
intent
of
the
statute
that
determines
whether
it's
an
offense
separate
from
the
other
and
that
you
don't
look
at
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case,
it
happens
to
be
largely
a
sale.
although,
as
i
say
there
is
elements
of
proof
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
my
difficulty
again
is
ambiguous
in
relation
to
block
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
to
make
one
sale,
one
crime?
well,
as
i
say
the
statute
doesn't
--
blockburger
doesn't
talk
necessarily
about
sale
as
such,
that
is
all
three
of
them
there.
sale
is
included
in
the
other
two,
but
sale
is
not
--
this
just
isn't
placed
under
the
other
two.
and
my
difficulty
is
that
where
this
one
start
i
think.
just
want
to
start
with
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case
there
is
to
say,
then
what
happens
in
the
situation
for
instance
where
you
see
somebody
who
purchased
one
day
and
sold
four
hours
later,
four
days
later,
transported
it
from
one
state
to
another
in
between
those
two.
if
we're
going
to
look
--
if
we're
going
to
start
looking
at
all
the
numerous
factual
variations
that
can
be
covered
by
these
statutes,
then
i
have
a
difficulty
in
deciding
how
one
can
determine
congressional
intent.
obviously,
congress
in
dealing
with
different
requirements
can't
think
of
all
the
possible
factual
variations
that
can
occur.
congress
punishes
--
breach
of
the
--
punishment
insulting
an
officer,
that
was
the
situation
in
gavieres.
now,
of
course
it
can
happen
as
it
has
happened
in
gavieres
that
those
were
performed
by
one
act.
it's
not
what
congress
is
thinking
about.
congress
is
thinking
about
a
general
type
of
evil
and
therefore
i
find
it
difficult
to
talk
about
ambiguity
without
talking
about
a
particular
fact
--
factual
setup.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
--
if
congress
had
said
who
sold
only,
i
think
that
there
we
get
into
the
question
that
we
had
in
cases
like
bell.
that
is
--
i
don't
think
--
i
take
it,
it
doesn't
necessarily
depend
on
whether
it's
in
one
paragraph
or
in
two.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
i
know.
one
thing
is
that
i
think
that
there,
under
the
rule
of
bell
and
c.i.t.
and
de
novo
there
might
--
it
might
be
possible
to
interpret
a
statute
as
saying
of
one
offense.
as
i
see
it
here,
the
trouble
is
not
only
the
statute
came
many
different
times
but
that
it
isn't
just
sale.
this
one
happens
to
be
sale.
but
there
are
cases
that
were
mentioned,
i
think
the
time
of
sherman
where
somebody
said,
oh
i
didn't
sell,
i
was
just
buying
for
a
friend
of
mine.
and
the
court
just
said
that
isn't
a
sale.
but
they
said,
well,
but
that
is
transporting
narcotics.
you
aren't
allowed
to
transport
them
either.
and
so,
the
difficulty
is
that,
as
i
see
the
statute,
they
cover
sale
and
it's
perfectly
true
that
at
least
as
to
heroine
in
many
cases,
anybody
who
does
that
will
almost
automatically
rallied
all
three,
but
not
necessarily
and
that
isn't
really
what
congress
was
thinking
about.
congress
was
thinking
about
the
fact
that
it
needed
all
these
additional
checks
on
these
very
small
objects,
very
easily
hidden.
if
one
to
keep
just
a
(inaudible)
possible,
we
have
this
in
all
sorts
of
variations
and
the
problem
becomes
of
course
often
very
difficult
solution.
for
example,
congress
requires
everybody
to
file
an
income
tax
return,
beyond
a
certain
amount
even
when
the
tax
isn't
due
for
a
particular
year.
but
it's
obviously
important
for
congress
to
know
that
everybody
is
filing
returns,
so
they
can
check
on
them
even
if
they're
not
going
to
collect
money
in
the
particular
time.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
keep
the
blockburger
rule
and
say,
let's
look
at
what
congress
have
to
say
--
decided
in
general
and
let's
leave
it
to
the
sentencing
judge
to
take
into
consideration
the
facts
to
this
particular
case.
now,
maybe
sometimes
judges
don't
do
--
don't
look
at
the
facts,
they
look
at
the
defendant
a
little
bit
more.
but
by
and
large
of
course
in
most
instances,
this
problem
is
handled
at
a
sentencing
level.
and
this
case
--
illustrates
again
on
the
problems
that
come
up
and
how
they
appear.now,
as
i
see
this
case,
there
is
a
10-year
sentence
on
any
theory
here,
unless
one
is
to
adopt
mr.
rauh's
noble
suggestion
that
no
matter
how
many
different
sales
and
how
many
--
over
six
months
possibly,
the
boggs
act
prohibit
more
than
five
years
for
any
one
conviction.
i
don't
think
that's
true
at
all.
the
boggs
act
in
receipt
of
its
statutes
in
general
say,
if
that
you've
once
been
convicted,
you
go
out
and
commit
an
offense
again,
we're
going
to
make
you
subject
to
a
greater
penalty
for
the
second
time
you
commit
the
mistake.
but
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
that
legislative
history
that
would
suggest
that
congress
ever
dreamed
of
the
fact
that
by
fixing
a
minimum
for
a
first
offense
and
then
making
a
higher
minimum
for
a
second
offense,
it's
thought
that
somebody
who
sold
--
made
10
different
sales
of
narcotics,
shall
i
say,
within
the
same
class
with
somebody
who
made
only
one.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
far
as
the
1956
act
is
concerned
which
came
even
later,
congress
even
differentiated
between
the
penalty
for
some
of
these
offenses.
the
stamp
tax
carries
a
lesser
penalty
and
the
possibility
of
probation
than
do
the
other
two.
and
as
far
as
the
general
attitude
of
congress
is
concerned
towards
multiple
offenses
in
these
narcotics
field,
the
1956
act
has
one
other
possible
indication.
it's
in
a
different
section
dealing
with
the
unauthorized
use
of
interstate
communications.
but
section
1403
of
the
1956
act
provides
that
every
separate
use
of
a
communication
facility
shall
be
a
separate
offense
under
that
section.
so,
i
think
that
it
can
--
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
later
history
that
shows
any
intent
to
overrule
blockburger.
on
the
other
hand,
there
--
it
never
was
explicitly
reaffirmed
what
seems
to
me
is
that
the
whole
doctrine
of
multiple
offenses
depending
on
what
has
been
defined
by
the
statute
rather
than
by
the
particular
fact
of
one
sale
has
been
by
1951,
so
ingrained
in
federal
law
and
so
little
question
until
the
later
cases
that
it
simply
wasn't
discussed.
and
of
course
again
the
problem
was
not
in
a
sense,
the
harsh
penalties
that
came
from
multiple
offenses
and
this
was
simply
a
prosecutive
caution
to
avoid
various
possible
defenses.
because
the
difficulty
that
congress
found
with
the
action
of
federal
judges
in
this
field
was
that
their
total
sentences,
consecutive
or
otherwise,
for
what
it
sought
to
low
and
its
whole
emphasis
has
been
on
increasing
minimums
rather
than
trying
to
overcome
the
harsh
effects
of
blockburger.
let
me
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
i
think
so
because
as
i
--
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
it's
a
little
--
the
idea
of
each
sale
as
the
defense
in
itself
involve
much
more
of
a
particularization
to
the
particular
fact
of
this
case
and
in
trying
to
determine
what
the
offense
is.
as
i
said
before,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
then
do
we
do
with
the
situation
that
mr.
rauh
was
talking
about,
where
the
statute
as
to
stamps
covers
both
purchase
and
sale.
it's
the
absence
of
stamps
that
the
offense
as
such
under
this.
and
therefore,
if
he
sells
without
a
written
order
form
but
one
happens
to
prove
purchase
as
well,
does
that
suddenly
transform
it
into
two
offenses
or
not.
if
one
starts
putting
emphasis
on
sales
in
this
case,
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
--
that
isn't
the
statute
because
the--
it
is
sale
along
with
transportation
and
concealment
and
so
on
under
the
import
act.
but
under
the
harrison
narcotics
act,
the
order
form,
as
i've
said,
has
a
purpose
separate
from
the
sale.
i
mean,
it's
the
checking
part
of
the
order
form
and
then
the
stamps
are
in
a
sense
suggested
the
offense
as
to
the
stamp
part
because
one,
there
are
means
of
--
the
revenue
in
identifying
narcotics.
so
that
i
think
the
question
basically
comes
down
to,
to
what
extent
are
we
going
to
start
with
a
congressional
purpose
or
to
what
extent
are
we
going
to
come
down
to
the
facts
of
how
the
congressional
purposes
has
been
violated
in
this
case
and
when
blockburger
left
it
to
the
sentencing
judge,
i
think
it
was
because
of
the
difficulties
in
trying
to
find
a
unit,
particularly
when
you
have
different
statutes
with
--
towards
different
purposes
in
mind
for
all
the
possible
variations
that
can
occur
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
--
would
get
out
to
counterfeiting
and
prohibition,
possession
of
liquor
that
was
involved
in
albrecht.
if
you
start
saying,
well,
there
were
times
when
possession
merges
into
sale,
well
then
the
question
is
then
you
have
to
decide
well
suppose
it
possessed
it
two
days
before,
is
that
the
--
does
that
then
merge,
is
possession
something
different
from
sale
in
that
situation
or
what
is
it
--
if
it's
two
hours
before,
is
that
something
different.
and
it
seems
on
the
whole
that
you
come
out
with
a
more
reasonable
and
understandable
guard
for
district
court
judge,
if
he
said
in
determining
what
the
offenses
that
congress
has
created.
we
look
at
what
congress
in
general
was
trying
to
punish
on
a
particular
case
before
it,
if
a
judge
can
adopt
his
sentence
to
his
case.
a
judge
doesn't
have
to
give
convicting
sentences
when
the
offense
is
separate.
and
i
think
it's
been
my
experience
that
if
one
looks
at
consecutive
sentences,
even
when
they
don't
absolutely
seem
to
conform
to
this
theory
that
the
judge
should
look
at
the
relationship
with
the
facts
to
each
other.
the
very
often
in
totality
they
do,
when
i
think
in
the
brief
we
cite
the
situation
in
bell
where
the
judge
gave
two
and
half
years
and
two
and
a
half
years
for
each
of
the
two
women,
when
he
could
have
made
a
sentence
of
five
years
for
the
transportation.
now
here,
as
i
say
there
are
two
sales
and
i
think
that
unquestionably
there
were
--
this
defendant
is
subject
to
two
five-year
maximum
sentences,
and
i
think
they're
supportable
even
as
written.
now,
what
the
judge
did
was
put
the
first
of
the
first
three
counts
and
all
the
three
of
the
second
three
counts
together,
that's
one
sentence
and
then
the
second
count
and
the
third
count
of
the
statute.
well,
playing
this
game
by
the
rule
so
to
speak
if
the
second
sale
is
the
second
offense,
that
rests
on
anyone
who
counts
two,
three
and
four.
and
the
first
sale
rests
on
count
two,
so
that
there's
a
10-year
sentence
in
any
event
in
this
case.
and
then
if
one
is
going
to
look
beyond
that
then
this
case
presents
some
other
questions
which
i
think
can
be
settled
at
the
district
court
level
under
proper
guidance
but
which
are
these.
as
i
have
said
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
of
course
it
depends
on
the
proof,
if
one
proved
only.
all
i
meant
was
it
punishes
more
than
that.
i
suppose
if
you
prove
that
the
man
purchased
on
one
guy
and
transported
on
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
for
the
--
for
the
transportation?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
on
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
our
interpretation
of
the
statute,
no,
your
honor.
because
what
we
say
is
that
in
one,
the
export-import
act,
if
any
dealing
in
illegally
imported
narcotics,
so
that
the
crucial
aspect
of
the
offense
is
the
illegal
importation.
and
therefore,
whether
you
sell,
or
whether
you
transport,
or
whether
you
conceal,
the
illegal
importation
is
fixed
at
the
event
as
to
the
stamps,
whether
you
purchase
or
whether
you
sell.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
as
to
the
stamps,
the
absence
of
stamps.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
the
absence
of
stamp
that
fixes
the
event
and
therefore
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
whether
he
purchase
or
sale
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it's
the
absence
of
stamps.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
sale
as
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
purchase
or
sale
without
from
--
not
in
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
from
the
original
stamped
package.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
not
--
that
--
that's
for
registered
dealers.
now,
the
--
the
offense
here
is
purchase
or
sale
not
from
the
original
stamped
package.
now,
the
stamp
is
the
thing
that
represents
the
money.
but
it's
the
absence
of
the
stamp
that
we
consider
that
this
is
to
the
effect
and
in
the
third,
well,
the
third
is
limited
to
sales
to
that
effect
without
a
written
order
form.
and
so,
on
our
theory
there
could
be
no
more
than
three
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
of
this
particular
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
basically
the
problem
as
we
see
it.
we
think
this
is
basically
a
problem
of
sentencing
and
i
suppose
as
i've
mentioned
before
that
one
must
concede
that
there
is
disparity
in
federal
sentencing.
i
don't
think
this
particularly
is
the
result
of
the
attitude
towards
permitting
joining
of
the
offenses
arising
out
of
one
transaction.
but
in
any
case
it
seems
to
me
that
blockburger
put
it
up
to
congress.
it
said
if
you
want
to
change
the
nature
of
the
offense,
that's
for
congress
to
do,
if
the
result
is
too
harsh
in
giving
this
much
power
to
the
sentencing
judge,
to
give
consecutive
or
concurrent
sentences,
that's
for
congress
to
change.
and
we
find
nothing
in
the
history
since
blockburger
that
indicates
that
congress
wants
to
change
that
particular
approach.
as
i
said,
there
have
been
some
indications
that
congress
is
giving
some
thought
and
eventually
possibly,
which
may
eventually
be
something
with
explanation
as
to
the
general
question
of
sentencing.
but
in
trying
to
deform
offenses,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basic
problem
has
to
be
that
one
must
look
at
the
intent
of
congress,
the
way
congress
legislates
which
is
sort
of
generally
and
that
with
--
it
has
a
particular
purpose
to
accomplish,
as
it
did
by
these
evils.
and
that
to
the
extent
that
in
any
one
particular
case
the
evils
tend
to
become
so
close
to
each
other,
that
one
may
raise
some
questions
as
to
separate
sentencing
that
ought
to
be
under
the
present
system
for
the
sentencing
judge
until
congress
decides
to
make
it
different.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
nothing
specific,
your
honor,
except
these
kind
of
tested
or
things
that
come
down
from
the
fact
that
they
changed
separate
statutes
and
so
on.
now
i
--
neither
the
1951
or
the
1956th
hearings
could
i
see
the
name
of
the
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there,
one
would
run
into
the
bell
philosophy
and
certainly
it
hasn't
been
done.
i
think
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
it
is
possible
--
i
think
it
is
possible
to
take
this
one
statute,
the
import-export
act
and
say
that
its
gist
of
the
offense
there
is
dealing
in
unlawfully
imported
narcotics.
but
i
think
that's
different
from
the
one
on
page
3
of
our
brief,
where
the
gist
of
the
offense
is
the
absence
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
one
is
dealing
in
unlawfully
imported
narcotics.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
other
is
the
absence
of
the
stamp
--
4704
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
and
this
is
--
in
the
gist
of
that
offense
is
the
absence
of
the
stamps
and
whether
it's
purchased
or
sale.
and
then
the
third
is
4704,
for
the
sale
without
a
written
order
form
and
the
gist
of
that
offense
is
the
order
form.
and
as
i
tried
to
point
out
in
the
enforcement
of
the
--
of
the
narcotics
legislation
in
general,
each
of
these
has
a
very
real
purpose.
now
for
instance,
as
to
legitimately
imported
narcotics
which
are
either
stolen
or
which
are
misused
by
a
druggist
or
a
doctor,
the
only
one
that
would
be
violated
would
be
the
written
order
form
requirement
because
they
would
have
stamps
and
they
would
be
legitimately
imported.
now,
there
is
some
fear
hasn't
become
practical
yet,
there
is
some
fear
that
narcotics
are
soon
going
to
be
manufactured
synthetically.
in
that
case,
this
2174
wouldn't
apply
but
the
order
form
and
the
stamps
could.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1953,
congress,
in
order
to
be
prepared
for
this
had
an
amendment
which
changed
the
definition
of
narcotics
for
the
purpose
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
cover
synthetics.
so
far,
this
hasn't
actually
been
proved
feasible
but
they're
afraid
it's
coming.
so
that
the
gist
of
each
of
these
offenses
has
a
different
purpose
and
it
is
possible
in
some
--
in
some
instances
where
some
to
be
violating
and
not
the
others.
now
at
the
present
moment,
i'm
willing
to
say
that
in
most
instances
and
particularly
with
relation
to
heroin,
which
is
outlawed
without
--
it
is
usual
that
a
person
who
does
an
illegal
act
file
appropriate
statute.
i
think
this
is
not
new.
i
take
it
that
a
counterfeiter,
normally,
when
he
makes
counterfeit
he
intends
to
pass
it
and
normally
any
person
engaged
in
kind
does
under
standard
definitions
tend
to
do
two
or
three
things
that
congress
has
said
he
shouldn't
do.
now
--
and
that's
what
i
find
very
little
significance
in
this
so-called
unitary
purpose
of
this
legislation.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
try
to
draw
the
line
too
fine,
if
we
don't
recognize
that
each
of
these
has
a
different
purpose,
that
in
a
sense
practically
every
factual
situation
presents
an
issue
for
--
between
litigation
and
for
differences
of
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
all
that
we
can
do
is
to
say
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind,
this
is
what
congress
said
shouldn't
be
done.
once
congress
has
said
it
shouldn't
be
done,
it's
subject
to
punishment
and
we'll
leave
it
to
the
sentencing
judge
to
say,
well
in
any
one
particular
case
or
these
things
so
close
together
that
maybe
the
sentences
ought
to
be
concurrent
rather
than
effective.
