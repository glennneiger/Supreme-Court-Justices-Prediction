mr.

may
it
please

mr.
james
h.
heller
in
addition
to
the
yancy
case
which
mr.
rauh
has
cited
to
you,
in
footnote
28
on
page
49
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
a
very
distinguished
opinion
by
judge
magruder
of
the
first
circuit.
the
martinez
case
which
is
also
another
case
in
which
one
of
the
various
permutations
came
up
of
two
offenses
under
the
same
statute.
this
is
very
old
hat
i
might
point
out.
mr.
james
h.
heller
this
is
on
page
49
of
our
brief
in
footnote
28.
the
--
it
is
true
there
are
cases
and
more
common
situation
in
narcotics
offensive
cases,
the
reported
ones,
but
this
business
of
two
offenses
under
the
same
statute
purchasing
illegally
imported
narcotics
and
then
selling
them
on
the
same
day
and
obviously
in
connection
with
the
same
transaction
if
you
read
the
reported
facts.
i'm
not
certain
that
i
recall
them
completely
in
the
martinez
case
but
this
has
happened
time
and
again.
there
isn't
any
question
but
that
the
courts
have
viewed
blockburger
as
authorizing
that
result
as
well
as
the
one
we
have.
and
i
think
the
--
the
distinctions
here
are
tweedledee
and
tweedledum
and
i
would
like
to
spend
this
rebuttal
if
i
may
going
through
this
case
because
--
a
little
bit
on
the
facts
because
i
think
it
is
a
typical
case.
i
may
stray
somewhat
into
the
facts
which
are
in
the
record,
which
we
obliged
with
the
court
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
serious
dispute
about
them
and
i'll
stick
mostly
to
the
government's
version
of
them.
now,
what
happened
here
is
this.
a
federal
narcotics
agent
found
an
informer
who
was
already
under
indictment
by
the
federal
government
and
who
was
as
the
defense
kept
putting
it
was
under
a
proposition,
if
he
helped
the
government
he
might
get
easier
treatment
and
he
also
was
getting
per
diem
payment.
and
this
agent
knew
the
defendant
gore
and
he
led
him
to
the
defendant
in
a
house
which
is
significantly
enough
about
10
blocks
from
here
and
no
more.
and
he
introduced
them.
now,
there
is
a
dispute
here
and
we'll
never
know
exactly
what
dan
coles,
the
informer,
said
to
the
defendant.
but
it
is
true
that
anyway
he
introduced
the
agent
as
a
man
who
wanted
to
purchase
narcotics.
the
agent
says
he
was
introduced
as
a
man
who
wanted
to
purchase
narcotics
to
sell
on
his
own.
in
any
event,
he
said
he
wanted
stuff
and
i
think
that
it
was
probably
elaborated
that
he
said
he
wanted
heroin
or
cocaine
because
that's
what
was
gotten.
now,
in
order
to
get
almost
anything
except
medicinal
morphine,
you
pretty
much
have
to
get
something
that
came
into
this
country
illegally
and
therefore
has
no
tax
stamps
on
it.
there
was
one
other
alternative
from
mr.
gore.
in
order
to
get
heroin,
he
probably
would
have
had
to
go
down
and
break
into
a
government
laboratory.
they
are
the
only
people
who
have
it.
and
the
other
alternative
form
was
to
rob
a
drugstore
which
i
suppose
would
add
to
criminality
but
would
obviously
be
separate.
but
however,
mr.
gore
went
out.
there
was
another
agent
watching
the
house
and
the
agent
lost
mr.
gore
less
than
a
block
from
his
house
and
finally
he
saw
him
come
back
later.
now,
ms.
rosenberg
has
said
that
there
was
some
evidence
of
transporting.
now,
the
evidence
of
transporting,
as
the
chief
justice
noted,
could
be
only
this.
he
pulled
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
he
gave
it
to
the
federal
agent
and
said
here
is
what
you
asked
me
to
buy
--
to
get
for
you.
now,
that's
transporting
obviously
because
anything
is
transporting.
this
is
transporting
but
it
obviously
was
part
of
the
sale.
and
i
don't
think
these
questions
or
verifications
of
the
statutory
crimes
of
bifurcations,
dichotomies
and
bind
distinctions.
i
don't
think
that
they
stick
at
anybody's
mind
as
being
the
essence
of
what
is
charged
here.
and
in
point
of
fact,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
continually
referred
as
you
could
see
at
page
85
and
86
of
the
transcript,
for
this
is
a
sale.
nobody
doubted
that
it
was
a
sale.
nobody
saw
mr.
gore
purchase
it.
nobody
could
have
known
whether
he
purchased
it
in
the
district
of
columbia.
he
was
gone
two
hours
and
you
could
be
well
into
maryland
in
that
time.
nobody
saw
him
transport
it
at
any
distance
except
from
his
pocket
to
the
agent's
hand.
so
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
unitary
conduct.
did
the
agent
give
him
a
written
order?
no,
because
if
he'd
given
him
a
written
order
he
would
have
tipped
mr.
gore
up
and
he
never
made
an
arrest.
now,
when
ms.
rosenberg
and
the
government
talk
about
the
enforcement
functions
of
these
things,
of
these
various
statutes,
we
don't
dispute
the
validity
of
the
statutes.
we
don't
say
they
shouldn't
be
on
the
books.
we
simply
say
that
these
functions
are
peculiarly
police
functions,
that
no
separate
evil
is
committed.
what
mr.
louise
who
was
the
federal
agent
wanted
from
mr.
gore
he
got.
he
got
him
to
make
an
illegal
sale
to
him.
nobody
claims
it
was
entrapment
but
in
the
circumstances
it
couldn't
have
worked
any
other
way.
it
is
uncommon
merely
that
there
are
three
violations
in
the
case
of
heroin,
cocaine,
smoking
opium,
it's
inevitable.
there
always
will
be
these
three
violations.
now,
the
question
comes
up
should
the
government
be
allowed
to
triple
counts.
is
it
important
to
anybody
that
they
be
allowed
to
triple
the
counts.i
cannot
see
that
ms.
rosenberg
has
said
at
any
point
in
her
argument
nor
can
i
find
it
in
the
government's
brief
that
one
good,
single,
public
interest
or
purpose
is
served
by
this,
although,
we
freely
concede
that
these
maybe
techniques
which
vastly
help
the
police
and
the
federal
authorities
to
detect
illegal
sales.
we
cannot
see
that
an
ultimate
injury
has
been
added
by
the
lack
of
the
stamp
or
by
the
lack
of
the
written
order.
the
agent
didn't
intend
to
give
the
written
order
because
if
he
had,
he
would
have
lost
his
criminal
right
then
and
there.
and
so,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
think
that
what
we
come
down
to
here
is
basically
an
arbitrary
situation
in
which
we
can
see
a
prosecutor
sitting
back
in
his
office
and
saying,
now
how
about
this
one,
should
i
make
it
one,
should
i
make
it
three,
should
i
make
it
six.
and
we
don't
believe
that
this
kind
of
power
should
be
given
to
the
prosecutor
and
we
don't
believe
that
it's
any
answer
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
or
the
sentencing
judge
will
normally
take
care
of
that
problem.
and
this
court
recently
had
experienced
in
the
yancy
case
with
the
situation
where
that
doesn't
always
work
out.
and
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
that
situation
before
us
that
the
trial
judge
gave
three
consecutive
sentences
or
three
of
the
most
technical
and
insubstantial
distinctions
that
could
have
occurred
in
the
space
of
five
seconds.
and
so,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
believe
this
case
should
be
remanded
for
sentencing
on
one
count
alone
with
perhaps
a
concurrent
count
for
the
second
sale.
mr.
james
h.
heller
thank
you,
your
honor.
