chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rauh,
according
to
your
--
your
view,
could
he
have
been
sentenced
to
one
to
five
to
run
consecutively
on
each
sale
that
he
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
--
i
mean
you
had
two
separate
sales
that
were
no
way
connected
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
you
this.
if
it
were
not
for
the
boggs
act,
could
he
have
been
sentenced
for
two
to
five-year
terms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
this
is
what's
going
through
my
mind.suppose
--
suppose
that
is
true
and
then
congress
comes
along
and
without
any
thought
of
pleadings
or
procedures
as
i
use
to
make
it
a
more
--
a
much
more
serious
offense
to
the
second
term
and
it
--
it
says
for
second
offense,
it
shall
be
10
years.
do
you
think
that
should
wipe
out
all
--
all
procedures
that
would
permit
separate
convictions
and
consecutive
sentences
in
that
field?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
here's
--
here's
my
point.
now,
before
the
boggs
act,
if
they
made
two
sales
he
could
have
been
convicted
of
both
and
he
could
have
been
sentenced
to
consecutive
sentences?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
congress
decides
that
the
punishment
is
not
severe
enough
for
habitual
criminals
and
it
passes
an
act
like
the
boggs
act
to
make
a
second
offense,
10
years
instead
of
five.
do
you
think
if
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind,
that
by
passing
the
--
the
boggs
act,
it
would
wipe
out
the
possibility
of
having
two
convictions
as
they
have
before
that
and
have
the
sentences
run
consecutively.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
then
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this
--
this
question.
do
you
--
do
you
feel
that
the
boggs
act
has
limited
the
government
in
punishing
the
narcotic
peddler
to
one
term
of
five
years
no
matter
how
many
sales
he
might
have
--
have
made
before
he
was
ever
convicted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
(voive
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
citation
with
that
yancy
case
if
you
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
rosenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
ms.
rosenberg.
suppose
congress
had
thought
of
all
of
these
facets
of
the
narcotic
traffic
at
one
time
and
had
determined
to
put
it
into
one
statute
and
into
one
paragraph
of
a
statute
by
saying
that
anyone
who
--
who
sells
narcotics
without
a
doctor's
prescription,
or
without
having
paid
the
tax
on
it,
or
without
having
a
stamp
on
the
narcotics
that
are
sold
shall
be
guilty
of
--
for
all
means
will
be
punished
by
one
to
five
years
in
--
in
prison.
could
the
government
prosecute
for
three
separate
crimes
there
and
punish
for
all
three
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i
was
just
simplifying
it.
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
--
ms.
rosenberg,
before
you
get
those
other
ones
i
--
i'd
like
to
ask
a
question
very
much
on
the
same
line
that
justice
black
asked
you.
you
--
you
said
that
these
three
different
statutes
under
which
this
man
was
convicted
had
a
number
of
other
elements
besides
sale.
suppose
it
was
broken
down
into
as
many
elements
as
there
were
in
those
statutes,
could
he
--
could
the
judge
have
sentenced
this
man
to
as
--
as
many
terms
consecutively
as
there
are
elements
in
this
--
in
all
those
statutes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
will
you
have
to
transport
it
if
you
moved
it
--
moved
it
across
the
room
to
give
it
to
him.
now,
could
--
could
he
gotten
five
years
more
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
for
--
for
taking
at
least
an
automobile
from
one
place
to
another.
could
--
would
it
have
been
possible
in
this
case
to
charge
also
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
transportation
because
it's
one
of
the
elements
and
could
the
judge
have
given
him
five
years
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
i
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
there
was
a
failure
--
i
know
there
was
a
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
they
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
isn't
it
also
--
isn't
it
also
an
offense
to
--
to
sell
--
sell
it
if
the
tax
is
not
been
paid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rauh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heller.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
have
you
--
do
you
have
something
more
to
say?
well
mr.
rauh
and
mr.
heller,
the
court,
i
know,
would
have
me
express
our
appreciation
to
--
to
you
for
having
accepted
the
appointment
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant.
we
always
feel
comforted
when
lawyers
are
willing
to
give
their
time
in
the
cause
of
that
kind
and
particularly
when
it
means
diligent
--
diligent
(inaudible)
you
gentleman
have.
so
we
thank
you
and
we
thank
you
of
course,
ms.
rosenberg
for
representing
such
diligence
in
the
government
of
the
united
states.
