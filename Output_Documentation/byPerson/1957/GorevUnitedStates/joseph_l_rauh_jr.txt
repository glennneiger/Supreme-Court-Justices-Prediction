mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
petitioner
was
properly
sentenced
to
three
consecutive
prison
terms
for
a
single
sale
of
narcotics
simultaneously
violating
three
anti-narcotics
statutes.
the
court
below
reluctantly
followed
this
court's
decision
in
blockburger
and
said
that
this
could
be
done.
the
facts
are
uncomplicated
and
i
believe
undisputed,
indictments
in
six
counts.
the
first
three
cover
one
sale
and
the
second
three,
cover
a
sale
two
days
later.
the
first
three
counts
are,
count
one
is
that
he
sold
without
the
required
written
order
that
violates
one
statute.
second
count
is
he
sold
the
same
narcotics
without
a
tax
stamp
that
violates
a
different
statute.
the
third
is
he
sold
it
knowing
it
has
been
unlawfully
imported,
a
third
completely
different
statute.
the
second
three
counts
has
four,
five
and
six,
are
the
same
statutory
violation
of
the
second
sale.
the
trial
was
like
every
other
narcotics
trial,
i
take
it,
like
the
ones
that
massey
alley
and
sherman
decided
this
morning.
it
was
simply
the
testimony
of
the
narcotics
agent
who
had
induced
the
sale.
we
make
no
claim
of
entrapment
because
we
were
not
--
we
know
nothing
about
the
situation
but
we
do
know
that
the
entrapment
point
was
raised.
but
the
testimony
was
roughly
the
same.
the
agent
comes
in
and
testifies.
he
went
to
the
man.
he
asked
if
he
could
buy
some
narcotics.
the
man
goes
out
for
an
hour.
he
comes
back,
hands
him
the
narcotics,
takes
the
government
agent's
money
and
that's
all
we
know
about
it.
we
do
know
that
it
was
simply
this
one
act
all
within
an
hour
of
going
out
and
getting
the
narcotics
and
handing
it
over
that
allegedly
violates
three
statutes.
now,
the
sentence
which
judge
youngdahl
gave
was
this,
one
to
five
years
on
the
first
count
for
selling
without
a
written
order,
one
to
five
years
consecutive
on
the
second
count
of
selling
without
tax
stamps
and
one
to
five
years
on
the
third
count
of
selling
knowing
of
the
unlawful
importation,
a
total
of
3
to
15
years
for
the
first
sale.
for
the
second
sale,
he
gave
him
a
concurrent
sentence,
so
that
what
we
really
--
what
we
have
before
the
court
is
the
consecutive
sentences
of
one
to
five,
one
to
five
and
one
to
five
for
the
one
sale
for
the
three
statutes.
in
other
words,
we
do
not
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
second
sale
because
that
was
all
concurrent.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
five
years
maximum
and
it
was
15.
the
minimum
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
one-third
of
the
maximum
under
the
indeterminate
sentence
act,
so
it
would
have
been
20
months,
would
have
been
most
of
the
minimum
could
have
been
and
we
have
3
to
15
instead
of
what
would
have
been
maximum
20
to
5
--
five
years.
now,
there
was
no
appeal
but
the
--
under
28
u.s.c.
2255,
petitioner
sought
relief
from
an
excessive
sentence.
the
district
court
found
he
was
not
entitled
to
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
by
judge
bazelon
and
judge
faye
both
expressed
their
displeasure
or
reluctance
to
follow
blockburger,
although
they
of
course
did
follow
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir,
under
the
boggs
act.
yes,
sir,
under
blockburger.
and
top
of
--
and
except
to
the
boggs
act,
yes,
sir.
this
is
a
completely
new
question
never
been
decided.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely.
but
if,
your
honor
please,
the
boggs
act
of
1951
makes
a
first
offender
a
maximum
sentence
and
a
second
offender,
it
would
be
my
contention
if
i
were
here
with
that
case
which
i
am
not
but
the
boggs
act
prevents
that
because
he
wasn't
a
person
who
had
been
previously
convicted
under
the
boggs
act.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
is
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now,
petitioner's
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
i
was
going
to
deal
with
it
under
the
statutory
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
construction
but
not
on
the
particular
point
that
the
chief
justice
asked
me
about.
now,
petitioner's
argument
falls
under
two
heading.
first,
we
maintain
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
the
simultaneous
violation
of
three
anti-narcotics
statutes
by
a
single
sale
of
narcotics
into
three
separate
sentences
for
the
purpose
of
conviction
and
sentencing.
we
do
say
of
course
that
congress
intended
to
make
them
separate
offenses,
that
they
could
be
prosecuted
under
either
that
the
government
doesn't
have
to
make
a
selection
until
sometime
but
that
they
cannot
have
consecutive
sentences.
and
secondly,
we
contend
that
if
congress
did
so
intend
its
action
as
applied
to
this
case,
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
that
part
is
not,
if
your
honor
please,
but
the
cases
this
morning
are
relevant
to
another
matter
and
i
did
want
to
deal
with
them
under
--
i
do
not
feel
that
the
majority
opinions
of
any
of
this
morning's
cases
in
anyway
forecloses
our
case
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
but
i
know
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
not
the
successive
prosecution
part,
if
your
honor
please,
but
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
which
they
raised.
the
different
evidence
test
i
think
is
relevant.
but
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
are
particularly
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
are
particularly
going
to
urge
on
this
part,
not
a
constitutional
decision
but
one
of
statutory
construction
and
not
solely
or
even
principally
because
of
this
court's
usual
rule
of
avoiding
that
constitutional
issues
can
--
when
it
can
vote
for
one
more
significant
purpose
it
seems
to
me
and
that
is
i
hope
is
the
one
thing
i
can
do
having
been
appointed
here
is
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
has
two
absolutely
irreconcilable
line
of
cases
going
down
side
by
side.
and
i
want
to
show
that
in
this
particular
matter
here,
a
proper
construction
of
the
intent
of
congress
cannot
only
reconcile
what
i
consider
these
irreconcilable
lines
of
cases,
namely
between
the
multiple
--
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases,
bell,
prince
and
universal
c.i.t
where
congress
is
required
to
explain
and
state
when
it
wants
a
severe
result.
and
the
multiple
statutory
offense
cases
where
several
statutes
are
involved,
where
this
court
has
taken
a
180-degree
diametrically
opposed
rule
and
said
there
that
automatically
if
there
is
different
evidence
or
a
different
element
then
congress
is
presumed
to
have
wanted
the
more
severe
result.
and
it
is
my
hope
to
be
able
to
make
clear
that
this
is
where
we
feel
the
reconciliation
can
come
by
applying
the
same
rule
of
demanding
of
congress
a
clear
expression
of
its
desire
for
severe
punishment
before
acting
in
the
two
sets
of
cases.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
i
do
challenge
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
if
your
honor
please,
but
i
--
i
am
not
--
i'm
rather
suggesting
that
the
--
that
we
can
--
that
the
major
thing
that
would
reconcile
the
cases
would
be
in
the
field
of
statutory
construction.
i
do
feel,
however,
that
if
this
court
should
feel
that
it
could
not
so
construe
the
intent
of
congress,
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
do
--
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
i
intend
to
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
to
present
that
to
--
to
the
court.
now,
on
point
one
which
we
do
feel
is
the
more
likely
ground
of
decision
that
the
intention
of
congress,
of
course,
in
284
u.s.
in
blockburger,
this
court
held
the
other
way.
this
court
held
that
a
sale
of
a
narcotic
without
a
stamp
under
one
statute
and
the
sale
of
a
narcotic
without
a
written
order
under
another
statute
that
congress
had
intended
to
allow
a
consecutive
--
two
consecutive
sentences
in
that
case.
no
argument
of
legislative
history
was
presented
to
the
court
and
the
government
suggests
that
the
court
knew
all
about
the
legislative
history
from
the
nigro
case
four
years
--
four
years
before.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
such
memory
on
so
complicated
a
situation
would
be
difficult
for
anyone.
at
any
rate
for
the
first
time,
we
believe
the
full
legislative
history
is
presented
in
our
brief.
and
here,
we
presented
a
little
extra
and
made
a
mistake
which
i
feel
obligated
to
point
out
to
the
court
as
i
go
along.
so
three
statutes
here
involved,
derived
from
three
earlier
statutes.
the
one
about
the
sale,
knowing
of
the
unlawful
importation
derives
from
the
opium
exclusion
act
of
1909.
the
one
about
selling
without
a
written
order
derives
from
the
harrison
act
of
1914.
the
one
about
the
sale
without
the
stamp
tag
derives
from
the
revenue
act
of
1918
enacted
in
1919.
and
we
made
the
same
mistake
of
assuming
this
last
one
was
part
of
the
harrison
act
because
the
court
in
blockburger
had
actually
made
the
same
implication.
actually,
the
three
statutes
do
come
from
different
--
at
the
--
into
the
law
at
different
time.
but
we
suggest
to
your
honor
that
there
is
--
honors
--
that
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
all
intended
for
a
single
purpose,
the
suppression
of
nonmedicinal
use
of
narcotics.
that
there
was
no
other
conceivable
purpose
for
these
three
statutes
and
it
is
of
no
significance
when
they
came
in
since
each
one
of
them
makes
clear
that
this
was
their
purpose.
and
i
particularly
would
like
the
court
to
note
on
pages
26
and
27
of
our
brief,
probably
the
best
statement
of
congressional
purpose
in
the
entire
legislative
history,
although
this
is
only
a
very
small
part
of
it
is
the
house
report
on
the
1914
statute
which
was
the
basic
statute
in
which
the
house
stated
as
its
purpose,
narcotic
should
be
confined
to
legitimate
medic
--
medical
channel
and
it
has
been
decided
by
them
that
only
by
justice
--
that
only
by
custom
laws
and
by
the
exertion
of
the
federal
taxing
power
can
be
desired
and
be
accomplished.
these
are
the
italicized
parts
there
and
this
is
the
thread
of
the
entire
legislative
history.
it
is
that
all
power
taxing
customs
interstate
commerce
must
be
used
to
suppress
the
nonmedicinal
use
of
narcotic.
now,
the
government
concedes
all
these,
i
believe.
i
don't
want
to
understate
this
but
it
is
my
belief
that
from
the
government's
brief,
they
concede
that
all
--
these
statutes
were
aimed
at
outlawing
sales
of
narcotics
except
through
recognized
medical
channel.
on
page
14
of
the
government's
brief,
it
states
that
these
statutes
were
aimed
in
outlawing
sales
of
narcotics
except
through
recognized
channels.
and
on
page
17
in
the
title,
the
government
says
the
three
narcotics
provisions
have
distinct
function
in
the
enforcement
of
the
ultimate
and
of
suppressing
narcotics.
so
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
no
question
of
the
unitary
purpose
of
congress
here.
now,
as
far
as
the
opposed
--
this
was
the
situation
when
we
had
blockburger.
this
was
not
argued
to
the
court.
the
legislative
history,
the
unitary
purpose,
the
suppressed
narcotics
was
not
explained
to
the
court
and
the
decision
went
the
other
--
went
the
way
opposite
of
our
contention.
and
we
believe
that
that
would
be
enough
now
for
reconsideration.
nevertheless,
the
post-blockburger
statutes
do
throw
some
light
on
this.
there
have
been
three,
the
1937
act,
the
1951
boggs
act
and
the
1956
act
which
involves
--
which
is
post
the
trial.
therefore,
i
thought
i
would
refer
solely
to
the
boggs
act
which
was
the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
act,
the
trial,
and
the
sentencing.
now
the
boggs
act,
by
providing
for
uniform
sentences
for
second
and
third
offenders
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
--
the
boggs
act,
if
your
honor
please,
it's
printed
in
several
places
but
the
--
probably
the
quickest
way
to
give
it
to
you
would
be
on
our
brief.
it's
in
twice.
the
first
section
of
the
boggs
act
is
included
as
the
penalty
part
on
page
3
and
the
second
section
of
the
boggs
act
is
the
penalty
on
page
5.
now,
everything
in
the
boggs
act,
it
seems
to
us,
points
towards
a
congressional
intention
against
consecutive
sentences
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
boggs
act
sought
uniformity,
stated
that's
perfectly
clearly
an
intention.
well,
how
can
one
be
uniformed
in
punishment
if
the
prosecutor
can
determine
how
many
crimes
you've
committed
and
can
use
in
one
case,
one
count
and
in
another
case
two
counts
and
in
another
case,
three
counts.
this
gives
prosecutorial
discretion
in
determining
crime
and
punishment,
and
judicial
discretion
rather
than
the
uniformity
sought
by
congress.
and
secondly,
there
was
a
--
congress
try
to
have
a
similarity
of
treatment
for
repeaters.
they
didn't
care
about
the
--
they
gave
the
same
sentence
both
when
they
were
--
for
what
they
were
--
regardless
of
what
the
repeater
did
and
regardless
of
what
the
repeater
had
done
before.
they
treated
them
--
they
showed
that
the
whole
thing
was
aimed
at
the
suppression
and
not
the
particular
method
in
which
the
criminal
or
alleged
criminal
happened
to
violate
the
law.
and
thirdly,
they
provided
for
differentiation.
they
believed
in
the
principle
of
reform.
and
the
first
sentence,
the
first
offense
was
not
intended
to
carry
as
--
as
severe
a
sentence
as
the
second
or
third.
well,
if
by
multiplying
the
punishment
at
the
first
offense,
you
can
get
and
we
did
here,
yet,
a
penalty
greater
than
there
was
--
could
have
legally
been
for
a
second
offense
under
the
boggs
act.
in
other
words,
the
maximum
of
15
years
which
was
given
here
is
five
years
longer
than
the
boggs
act
permits
for
a
second
offense.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
congress,
i
must
say
never
mentioned
blockburger,
the
point
in
blockburger
or
anything
that
i
have
said.
there
was
therefore
no
ratification
involved
in
this,
nor
was
there
any
support
for
our
position.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
silence
of
congress
here
evidences
a
fact
that
they
--
and
this
was
the
fourth
point
under
--
under
boggs,
it
seems
to
be
very
relevant
if,
your
honor
please,
severity.
boggs
act
is
--
increased
the
punishment.
it
was
very
severe
on
the
criminal.
i
do
not
think
when
they
are
that
severe
that
you
would
then
assume
that
congress'
silence
was
intended
to
say,
“oh,
we
don't
care
how
much
more
severe
it
is.
you
can
triple
it
by
counting
it
three
sentences
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
for
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
assumed
that
too,
your
honor.
and
--
and
there
--
but
it
does
seem
to
me
in
this
instance
not
thinking
about
it
would
more
likely
help
petitioner's
case
in
the
government.
and
then
there
is
one
parenthetical
case
point
about
the
boggs
act
that
i
was
going
to
mention
at
this
point
but
i'd
already
mentioned
it
in
connection
with
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
which
is
that
the
boggs
act
may
affect
the
two
sale
problem
but
i
don't
think
it's
involved
in
this
--
in
this
case
because
the
boggs
act
does
say
that
a
second
offender
is
one
who
had
previously
being
convicted.
that
would
not
have
been
true
here.
he
could
not
be
treated
as
a
second
offender.
in
our
judgment,
if
this
case
does
arise
at
some
--
in
some
other
connection
why
the
issue
will
be
raised
for
the
court
whether
congress
did
not
intend
there
to
treat
even
the
two
sales
as
limited
by
the
penalty
which
a
man
could
receive
for
the
first
offense.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'm
afraid
that
i
don't
fully
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
understand
it,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
very
clearly
intended
a
second
offender
to
be
only
one
who
had
been
previously
convicted.
that
is
if
you
made
two
sales.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
say
a
month
apart
but
you
weren't
convicted
in
the
interim,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
did
not
treat
you
as
a
second
offender.
you
were
only
a
second
offender
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
if
you've
been
convicted
in
the
--
in
the
interim.
now,
congress
tried
to
treat
a
second
offender
as
one
who
hadn't
been
convicted
in
the
interim
that
seems
--
and
wanted
to
say
if
a
man
made
two
sales,
i
will
be
more
severe
even
though
he
hasn't
been
convicted,
that
raises
some
questions
of
fair
treatment
but
i
doubt
it
if
it
would
go
to
the
extent
of
a
due
process
point.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
even
though
it
is
not
involved
here,
i
do
feel
strongly
that
that
--
that
is
the
way
it
would
work.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
five
years
is
--
20
months
to
five
years,
the
first
count
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
because
of
the
--
one
knows
it
could
be
two
sentences
but
they
couldn't
add
up
to
more
than
the
boggs
act
would
permit
because
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
previous
conviction.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
are
urging
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
the
court
to
reject
blockburger
and
i
will
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
correct.
now,
let
me
--
if
i
may
do
what
this
seems
to
be
but
the
only
thing
we
have
uncovered
that
might
be
considered
new
in
this
field
and
that
is
what
happened
in
blockburger
and
why
we
think
reconsideration
is
so
essential.
now,
the
court
didn't
have
the
legislative
history
before
it
at
that
time
and
it
may
--
well
if
i
may
say
so,
a
mistake
that
it
sometimes
occurs,
it
applied
a
test
that
have
been
set
up
as
constitutional
test
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
may
i
explain
what
i
mean?
if
you
will
look
at
blockburger,
you
will
see
that
what
were
cited
are
the
murray
case
from
massachusetts
and
the
gavieres
case,
both
of
which
dealt
with
the
double
jeopardy
question
and
said
that
the
rule
for
double
jeopardy
is
whether
there's
a
different
element
or
different
evidence.
and
then
without
any
discussion,
blockburger
applies
that
rule
as
though
it
was
related
to
the
intent
of
congress.
well,
there
is
no
possible
reason
for
assuming
that
congress
in
deciding
severity.
in
deciding
how
much
to
punish
someone
should
have
thought
that
a
good
rule
would
be
a
rule
that
have
been
set
up
for
constitutional
purposes
and
i
--
it
just
seems
to
me
as
clear
as
night
and
day
that
this
just
wasn't
--
just
wasn't
thought
of
at
the
time,
that
double
jeopardy
had
not
been
raised
in
blockburger.
but
that
the
court
really
without
very
much
discussion
just
applies
cases
that
involved
the
double
--
the
different
element
or
different
evidence
test
that
comes
from
the
constitutional
discussion
in
the
massachusetts
case
and
then
in
this
court's
decision
in
gavieres,
it
pulls
that
over
that
constitutional
test
as
though
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
intent
of
congress.
without
ever
considering,
whether
this
would
have
been
a
logical
intent
of
congress
and
without
one
word
in
the
legislative
history
ever
suggesting
that
congress
was
thinking
in
the
terms
of
a
different
evidence
or
different
element
test.
and
we
say
that
the
use
of
the
different
element
or
different
evidence
test
for
statutory
construction
is
--
is
putting
one's
hand
--
hand
in
the
standard.
no
--
congress
has
never
suggested
that
test.
this
court
just
assumed
congress
meant
that
and
we
suggest
the
abandonment
of
this
test.
now
to
suggest
the
abandonment
of
a
test,
you
have
to
be
prepared
to
suggest
one
in
twice.
we
are
so
prepared.
seems
to
me,
this
court
has
suggested
itself
in
--
if
unit
of
prosecution
cases
which
i
meant
before,
universal
c.i.t.,
bell
and
prince.
all
three
of
these
cases
reject
the
different
element
or
different
evidence
cases
because
in
every
one
of
those
three
cases,
you
have
a
different
element.
as
far
as
though
--
you
had
to
prove
there
were
two
ladies
in
the
--
in
the
car
or
you
have
to
prove
that
there
was
a
different
employee.
this
court
has
rejected
the
different
element
test
or
different
evidence
test
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
when
you
had
one
statute,
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases,
you
couldn't
possibly
continue
the
different
--
it
seems
to
me
the
different
evidence,
different
element
test
when
you've
got
several
statutes
because
it's
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
utilized
the
different
element
or
different
evidence
test
when
it
came
to
the
multiple
statute
case
but
it
wasn't
prepared
to
utilize
that
when
it
came
to
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases.
instead,
this
court
set
up
a
rule
congress
must
tell
us
when
they
want
the
more
severe
result.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
--
this
is
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
here
to
bring
two
different
lines
of
cases
together
and
we
so
urge
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
this
court
may
--
this
court
said
that
there
was
an
internal
revenue
in
blockburger.
this
court
talks
about
the
internal
revenue
aspects
of
this
in
an
effort
to
avoid
a
constitutional
question
which
today
would
not
arise.
the
difference
in
decisions
on
the
commerce
power
would
make
possible
this
without
all
the
pettifoggery
that
went
into
the
use
of
the
internal
revenue
part.
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
your
honor
that
the
--
that
the
total
tax
on
our
client
here
had
he
paid
it
would
have
been
one-seventh
of
one
cent
and
the
total
cost
of
the
written
order
would
have
been
one
cent.
of
course,
he
couldn't
get
one
because
it
was
illicit
activity
but
it
demonstrate
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
but
this
court
had
to
look
a
little
bit
--
had
to
--
in
order
to
sustain
that,
it
found
some
revenue
aspects
that
it
wouldn't
have
to
find
today
in
order
to
sustain
this
act
today
because
the
commerce
decision
are
so
totally
different
today
than
they
were
at
the
time
of
blockburger.
and
this
court
in
blockburger
talked
about
an
in
--
a
revenue
aspect
which
today,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
same
question
of
constitutional
power
arise
--
arose.
this
court
would
feel
called
upon
to
mention.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
may
i
say,
if
your
honors
please,
that
--
that
not
only
with
this
--
what
we're
suggesting
here
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
to
use
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases
here.
but
then
if
you
don't,
we
get
into
an
--
into
some
real
difficulty.
in
the
first
place,
the
court
below
cited
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases
as
though
they
applied.
several
courts
have
urged
a
change
in
blockburger
but
this
--
but
the
best
case
really
to
illustrate
my
point
is
a
case
that's
come
down
since
we
filed
our
brief
and
i
do
want
to
call
it
to
the
court's
attention.
it's
united
states
v.
yancy,
y-a-n-c-y.
it's
in
252
f.2d
554.
this
was
the
epitome
of
these
two
lines
of
cases.
this
was
in
the
sixth
circuit.
a
man
was
indicted
for
the
purchase
of
some
narcotics
without
a
tax
stamp
and
the
sale
of
the
same
narcotics
without
a
tax
stamp.
this
made
it
a
unit
of
prosecution
case
like
bell
and
those
and
not
a
multiple
statutory
case
like
blockburger.
but
as
good
a
circuit
judge
as
potter
stewart
treated
it
because
i
think
it
was
narcotics
as
though
it
fell
under
blockburger
whereas
in
fact
it
was
a
unit
of
prosecution
case
that
should
have
been
treated
like
bell,
universal
c.i.t
and
prince.
and
i'm
just
suggesting
that
--
that
it
reduced
this
thing
of
two
lines
of
cases
to
it
--
to
its
logical
and
to
an
absurdity
because
he
didn't
know
which
line
to
follow.
it
was
really
a
unit
of
prosecution
case
and
therefore
one
would
logically
have
followed
that.
but
it
also
was
narcotics
and
he
followed
the
blockburger
decision
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
that
is
the
c.i.t
is
your
--
waging
our
case
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
different
employees.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
different
employees.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
was
one
part
of
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
suggest
to
you,
your
honor
that
the
difference
is
all
in
our
favor.
now,
take
the
employee
situation
in
universal
c.i.t.
this
court
held
that
if
you
pay
three
employees,
each
of
them
less
than
the
minimum
that
was
just
one
offense.
they
interpreted
congress
that
way.
the
act
of
paying
three
different
employees,
different
paycheck,
different
pay
envelopes,
just
one
offense
for
paying
three
different
employees
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
i
--
i'm
sorry.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
broader
than
that.
it
was
the
idea
and
it
is
--
it's
articulated,
it's
actually
more
articulated
than
bell
that
congress
has
got
to
state
when
it
wants
a
more
severe
results.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
i'm
saying
that
you
can't
say
congress
has
to
state
for
the
more
severe
results
when
you've
got
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases
under
one
statute
then
it
has
to
state
it
wants
a
more
severe
result
when
a
single
act
violates
three
statutes.
on
the
contrary,
there
is
much
more
reason
for
saying
the
single
act
under
three
statutes
should
have
one
offense
than
there
was
for
saying
that
several
acts
under
the
single
statute
should
have
one
of
them.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
there
was
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
not
quite,
your
honor,
because
there
have
been
codification,
the
boggs
act
brings
all
the
punishments
into
one
--
you
--
i
don't
--
the
fact
that
the
statutes
are
at
different
time,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
(a)
would
be
very
determinative
a
part
from
it,
but
(b)
if
it
were,
they
--
the
punishments
have
been
brought
into
one
codification
without
stating
the
answer
to
this
problem.
and
i
see
no
more
reason
when
this
was
done
why
this
court
should
say
looking
at
the
--
at
the
statutory
situation
in
one
case
we
want
a
rule
of
harshness
and
we
want
a
rule
of
lenity.
in
fact,
the
court
has
--
the
court
--
the
blockburger
rule
is
so
bad
because
it
doesn't
even
leave
open
the
question
of
intent
of
congress.
you
see,
what
we've
gotten
in
--
in
the
unit
of
prosecution
cases
as
the
rule
of
lenity,
they
have
to
speak
frankly
and
freely
and
tell
us.
we
have
on
the
other
case,
the
blockburger
case
that
--
we
don't
look
at
what
they
say.
we
assume
a
different
element
test.
we
actually
don't
have
anyone
in
the
middle
saying
let's
look
and
find
out
what
the
balance
of
congressional
intent
is.
we
have
two
rules
that
seemed
to
be
going
in
opposite
directions.
and
it's
for
this
reason
that
we
--
and
for
the
criticism
from
the
court
below
and
the
mixing
up
of
these
two
lines
of
cases
which
reach
the
type
of
absurdity
in
the
--
in
the
yancy
decision
by
judge
stewart
when
he
didn't
know
which
line
to
follow
so
he
followed
the
one
that
used
the
word
drugs.
and
i
--
i
don't
blame
him
for
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
get
this
thing
straightened
out
and
that
this
was
a
major
proposal
that
as
a
counsel
we
desire
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
now
if,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
252
f.2d
554.
it
was
decided
on
february
28th,
at
least
we
were
not
aware
of
it
at
the
time
we
filed
our
brief.
i
do
not
know
whether
a
petition
has
been
filed
in
this
court.
it
had
not
the
last
time
we
checked.
now,
coming
from
here
--
we
urge
that
this
rather
than
the
constitutional
decision,
not
only
for
the
basic
rule
of
--
that
this
court
avoids
constitutional
decisions
but
that
a
great
deal
of
clarity
on
the
whole
problem
could
be
done
on
the
statutory
construction
side.
nevertheless,
we
do
feel
to
call
on
to
go
into
the
constitutional
point
very
briefly.
now,
there's
a
preliminary
question
which
we
thought
might
be
argued
by
the
government,
whether
multiple
punishment
at
one
trial
could
ever
be
double
jeopardy.
the
government
at
page
38
of
its
brief
concedes
that
it
can
be
in
footnote
18
on
page
38.
the
government
concedes
the
preliminary
question
which
we
briefed
but
i
do
not
feel
to
call
upon
to
argue.
it
states
--
the
government
states,
we
do
not
dispute
petitioner's
position,
that
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense
after
a
single
trial
would
be
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy.
now,
the
question
is
was
this
the
same
offense?
now,
the
constitution
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
subject
for
the
same
offense,
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
primary
meaning
would
appear
to
mean
in
same
offense
would
be
same
offense
and
that
it
would
be
same
act,
or
same
conduct,
or
same
transaction
not
possibly
too
late
for
such
a
meaning.
i
think
when
you
come,
you
try
to
--
to
this
court,
you
try
to
--
to
absorb
as
much
of
--
of
history
as
you
can
and
it
is
probably
too
late
to
go
back
to
the
primary
--
what
would
have
seemed
to
us,
the
primary
meaning.
it
is
not,
however,
too
late
to
go
--
to
make
same
offense,
one
offending
of
society,
one
social
evil.but
in
other
words,
if
the
same
transaction
creates
only
one
social
evil,
then
it
would
seem
to
us
that
there
should
be
a
violation
--
that
should
be
treated
as
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
now,
there's
nothing
in
hoag
or
ciucci
this
morning,
which
in
anyway
revalidates
the
earlier
decision
or
it
challenges
the
point
we
are
now
making.
in
the
first
place
those
were
state
cases
and
i
take
it
that
the
majority
view
remain,
the
double
jeopardy
is
not
within
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
the
second
place,
it's
very
likely
that
even
if
this
court
adopted
what
we
urge,
which
is
that
where
there
is
one
transaction
then
it
would
be
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy,
unless
that
single
transaction
created
two
social
evils.
you
might
still
say
that
the
murder
of
two
people
was
two
social
evils
or
the
robbery
of
two
people.
in
fact,
we
had
foreseen
this
problem
and
at
page
71
of
our
brief
in
a
footnote
we
had
rather
assumed
that
these
cases
would
--
might
go
that
way
and
had
distinguished
the
problem
in
our
footnote
51
at
page
71.
now,
the
different
evidence
test,
i've
pointed
out
as
meaningless
for
purposes
of
statutory
construction.
it
doesn't
work
as
a
constitutional
test.
it
got
into
the
law,
i
might
say
by
accident.
it
was
borrowed
from
murray
against
commonwealth
in
1871
in
massachusetts
where
mr.
murray
was
indicted
for
relations
with
one
bridget
kennedy
and
he
was
indicted
for
both
adultery
and
lewd
cohabitation.
the
massachusetts
court
put
the
no
double
jeopardy
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
different
element
in
each
case.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
had
they
put
it
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
different
social
evil
in
each
case,
namely
the
one,
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
state
in
protecting
the
state
as
a
matrimony,
the
other
in
the
public
morals
you
would
have
had
a
different
development
of
the
law
of
double
jeopardy
in
america.
but
this
court
borrowed
this
different
element
as
--
just
took
this
different
element
or
different
evidence
test
as
a
basis
of
constitutional
decision
from
the
murray
case
in
the
gavieres
case
without
any
consideration
of
the
fact
that
the
murray
case
itself
was
explicable
on
other
grounds.
and
the
point
is
--
and
even
argued
in
blockburger
--
in
blockburger
and
many
other
cases,
it
is
just
assumed
that
the
different
evidence
or
different
element
test
works.
now,
the
--
i
can't
see
the
different
element
test
at
all
as
a
constitutional
test.
the
--
the
government's
whole
point
is
that
you
don't
look
at
what
the
facts
that
the
individual
did.
you
look
at
whether
there
are
different
statutes
involved
and
different
evidence
under
the
statutes.
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
bill
of
rights
looks
at
what
the
individual
does.
but
the
--
that
the
difference
between
us
and
the
government
is
not
great,
it's
just
the
fact
that
we're
on
different
sides
of
the
room
looking
at
the
--
at
the
same
point.
we
say
that
under
the
bill
of
rights,
you
don't
look
at
what
congress
did
to
see
its
three
statutes
here
for
constitutional
purposes,
you
look
at
how
they
affect
the
individual
and
the
individual
was
engaged
in
only
one
transaction.
and
if
he
only
offended
one
social
purpose
or
one
social
interest
by
that,
it
does
not
--
not
seem
to
--
to
us
that
this
would
warrant
saying,
why
you
can
get
him
as
many
times
as
you
want
as
long
as
he
happens
to
have
--
by
his
single
act
have
done
--
have
gone
against
three
different
statutes,
even
though
he
didn't
do
--
even
though
nothing
in
there
was
against
a
different
social
evil.
that
was
the
one
evil
here
at
the
suppression
of
narcotics.
it's
the
one
sale
that's
involved.and
it
seems
to
us
that
a
time
has
come
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
basic
constitutional
test
if
this
court
reaches
it.
we
of
course
presenting
with
full
vigor
that
this
problem
should
not
be
reached
here
because
the
statutory
problem
of
reconciling
the
two
lines
of
cases
would
help
us
a
great
deal
more.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
but
it
almost
always
does,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
was
no
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
--
congress
didn't
--
i
take
it
would
be
very
severe
within
the
realm
of
the
--
within
the
realm
of
the
eighth
amendment,
it
can
be
quite
--
quite
severe
and
it
is
quite
severe
on
narcotics.
you
can
even
be
executed
today
for
a
particular
sale
of
narcotics,
the
sale
of
heroin
to
juveniles,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
say
that
you
may
get
to
the
eighth
amendment
at
a
certain
stage.
your
honor
yourself
went
on
bell
as
you
get
to
the
eighth
amendment.
if
you
don't
get
to
the
eighth
amendment
then
congress
can
be
as
severe
as
it
wants.
but
i
do
not
see
that
that's
ground
for
limiting
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
simply
that
congress
may
have
a
way
of
making
things
more
severe
within
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
coming
back
to
the
constitutional
test
we
proposed,
that
if
the
both
--
the
same
--
if
the
same
transaction
on
the
--
and
--
and
the
same
social
evil,
this
seems
to
be
--
there's
more
support
for
this
position
than
appears
--
than
has
been
generally
understood
and
we
have
tried
to
collect
it
in
our
brief
in
the
first
place
the
legal
periodicals
have
accepted
this.
i
think
--
and
justice
harlan
cited
this
morning
in
the
hoag
case,
several
of
the
periodicals,
actually
the
kirchheim
(ph)
article
in
the
yale
law
journal
which
justice
harlan
cited
--
cites
this
morning
does
make
the
very
argument.
actually,
we
have
borrowed
the
argument
from
--
from
his
article
there.
the
american
law
institute
takes
roughly
the
same
position.
now,
i
like
to
point
out
our
footnote
on
page
66,
i
don't
think
the
government
agrees
with
us
and
our
interpretation
of
the
law
institutes
the
position
but
i
think
justice
harlan
has
made
that
clear
this
morning
in
the
hoag
case.
the
law
institute
suggests
--
well
the
law
institute
proposes
the
overruling
of
albrecht
which
is
the
possession
and
sale
of
liquor
case.
they
will
go
--
they
just
proposed
that
to
be
overruled.
as
far
as
our
case
is
concerned,
their
proposal
is
--
it
doesn't
mention
it
but
it
reaches
the
same
result.
they
say
where
there's
one
transaction,
then
there
must
be
one
trial.
and
where
there's
one
trial,
then
the
most
you
should
get
should
be
the
highest
sentence
on
--
that
is
given
out
for
anyone
of
the
counts.
that's
what
we
--
we
have
in
our
footnote
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
law
institute,
as
well
as
the
legal
periodicals,
as
well
as
judge
rutledge's
opinion
in
the
buckley
case
when
he
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
here,
seem
all
to
support
the
constitutional
argument
we
are
making
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
say
on
the
statutory
construction
point,
i
want
--
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
quite
agree
but
not
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now,
on
the
constitutional
argument
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
court
has
the
obligation.
if
congress
has
made
a
--
if
congress
has
--
actually
congress
hasn't
acted
on
this,
the
government
by
its
triple
prosecutions,
by
its
--
and
judge
youngdahl,
by
his
action
in
--
in
giving
the
three
consecutive
sentences
who
created
the
--
the
problem.
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
the
--
the
idea
of
congress
implementing
the
fifth
amendment
to
double
jeopardy
clause,
so
as
to
deal
with
the
problem.
i
would
have
thought
before,
your
honor
spoke
that
that
was
likely
the
concern
of
this
court.
it
was
this
court's
obligation
if
it
violated
the
due
process
clause.
i
mean
it
violated
double
jeopardy.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
it
does
appear
to
me
that
it
does.
i
would
--
i'd
go
farther,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
that
when
the
constitution
says
the
same
offense,
it
means
the
same
offense
and
one
act
means
one
offense.
but
i
think
it
maybe
too
late
to
--
and
i
feel
somewhat
obligated
not
to
propose
so
radical
a
shift
with
the
past.
therefore,
we
are
suggesting
a
more
limited
test
which
is
the
very
test
which
was
suggested
by
mr.
kirchheim
(ph)
in
the
article
cited
in
your
--
in
your
opinion
this
morning.
now,
in
conclusion
i
would
just
like
to
state
five
reasons
why
we
feel
that
blockburger
should
be
reversed
on
the
statutory
ground
or
the
constitutional
ground,
but
i
think
that
i've
made
our
position
clear
in
favor
of
the
statutory
ground.
first,
there
is
no
enforcement
problem,
the
government
conceives
that
there's
no
enforcement
problem
in
this
--
about
this.
their
argument
is
on
the
contrary
there's
not
much
--
it
doesn't
do
much
damage,
the
judge
can
always
take
care
of
it.
their
argument
is
this
as
a
minimal
problem.
leave
it
all
alone
because
it's
worked
all
right.
but
the
government
conceived
that
this
will
not
create
an
enforcement
problem
for
you.secondly,
it
will
reconcile
the
two
lines
of
cases
which
seems
to
me
the
day
to
be
creating
the
conclusion.
thirdly,
there
is
a
dissatisfaction
among
the
lower
court
judges.
there
are
four
--
there
are
four
circuit
courts
of
appeal
which
--
which
have
expressed
their
dissatisfaction
of
blockburger,
the
court
below
here,
the
second
circuit,
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
yancy
sixth
circuit
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
time
--
further
more
and
fourthly
the
--
the
grave
injustice
to
leave
this
to
prosecutor
and
judge
the
danger
of
disparity,
the
danger
of
high
sentences
more
than
in
one
circuit,
one
--
one
district
more
than
another.
and
finally,
i
think
it
should
be
said
that
congress
has
sought
to
develop
uniformity.
that's
what
i
think
the
meaning
of
the
boggs
act
as
one
of
uniformity
and
we
urge
a
reversal
in
the
interest
both
of
uniformity
(inaudible).
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
bulk
of
our
rebuttal
will
be
given
by
mr.
heller
who
is
--
was
appointed
by
the
court
as
co-counsel.
there
are
just
two
factual
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
i'm
afraid
--
i
don't
agree
with
ms.
rosenberg's
answer
to
justice
black
on
this
question
as
the
government's
policy.
if
she's
correct,
then
i
think
mr.
yancy
is
entitled
to
a
different
decision
from
the
sixth
circuit
because
there,
in
the
case
i
cited
to
this
court,
it
was
the
purchase
and
the
sale
of
the
same
heroin
on
the
same
day
that
was
made
into
two
offenses.
in
other
words,
this
can
be
proliferated
long
with
--
far
beyond
the
three
statutes
that
can
be
proliferated
within
the
statute.
in
fact,
it
was
proliferated
within
the
one
statute
in
the
yancy
case
and
the
sixth
circuit
upheld
the
proliferation.
i
think
wrong
contrary
to
bell
but
it
did
uphold
it
and
secondly
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
and
finally,
the
question
of
whether
a
10-year
sentence
is
proper.
i'm
not
saying
that
possibly
judge
youngdahl
might
have
given
a
10-year
sentence
if
you
overruled
my
feeling
about
boggs.
the
fact
is
judge
youngdahl
didn't.
judge
youngdahl
gave
a
five-year
sentence,
a
fifth
--
3
to
15
on
the
first
sale
and
made
it
concurrent
on
the
second.
so
there's
nothing
this
court
could
do
to
change
that.
if
this
court
holds
that
our
contention
is
correct,
it
would
send
the
fact
for
remand
for
some
sentencing
problem
where
there
is
--
i
don't
--
didn't
want
it
to
lie
here
that
a
10-year
sentence
was
proper
in
any
event.
judge
youngdahl
did
not
give
a
second
sentence
for
the
second
sale.
he
gave
--
made
that
concurrent.
therefore,
there
is
only
a
five-year
sentence
before
this
court
if
we
are
correct.
