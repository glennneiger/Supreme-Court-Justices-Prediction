what
was
the
maximum
sentence
it
could
have
imposed
--
imposed
if
this
was
a
single
and
just
to
be
--
used
it
as
a
single
crime?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
that
mr.
rauh's
argument
that
blockburger
is
inconsistent
with
the
bell
line
of
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assume
that
one
gains
the
conclusion
for
statute
that
the
congressional
contempt
was
ambiguous
where
would
you
think
we
ought
to
go
from
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
to
whether
they
intended
to
make
it
one
crime
or
whether
they
intended
to
make
it
several?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
to
show
that
congress
was
aware
of
blockburger?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
we
could
decide
this
case
against
you
without
getting
another
problem,
couldn't
we?
