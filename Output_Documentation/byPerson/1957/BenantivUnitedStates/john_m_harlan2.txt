justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
that's
been
held?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
the
second
circuit
said
that
it's
--
it's
alright.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
oh,
i
thought
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
alright
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
assuming
--
assuming
that
a
state
officer
could
not
divulge
the
communication
itself
in
a
federal
court,
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
he
also
can't
divulge
the
fruits
of
the
communication.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
you
got
here
isn't
it?
you've
got
fruits
involved
here
and
not
the
conversation
itself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
had
the
fruits
and
not
the
conversation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
got
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
tree
and
the
fruit,
there
was
no
testimony
here,
as
i
understand
it,
by
the
state
officers
as
to
what
they
heard
over
the
wires,
am
i
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
to
federal
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
were
some
federal
officers
in
nardone,
too,
were
they
not?
not
state
officers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wish
you'd
help
me
out
on
one
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wish
you'd
point
to
me
where
i
can
find
what
you
say
that
the
communication
itself
was
testified,
too,
in
here
as
distinguished
from
the
truth.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
find
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
we've
got
to
decide
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
maybe
there's
no
dispute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(voice
overlap)
the
government
on
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
just
(voice
overlap)
they
knew
i
--
i
had
it
--
understood
the
case
differently
that
the
only
thing
that
we
were
concerned
with
here
was
the
fruits
not
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
conversation
itself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
page

thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
sorry
it
doesn't
answer.
to
me
all
it
says
is
what
happened,
it
doesn't
say
that
they
testified
to
this
at
the
trial.
the
reason
i
press
you
on
this
is
because
the
--
your
argument
turns
on
the
divulging
aspect
of
this
interception
of
communication.
justice
john
m.
harlan
second
nardone
case,
i
suggest
again
involves
federal
officers
and
not
state
officers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
wrong
but
i'm
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
apart
from
that,
was
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
testified?
did
it
come
out
or
as
to
it's
ever
intent
--
did
it
come
out
of
the
trial
or
just
a
mere
fact
that
there
was
a
tap.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i
am
--
i
don't
know
why
i
have
so
much
trouble
about
this.
i
must
be
stupid
but
as
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
was
the
jury
--
did
the
jury
have
before
it,
testimony,
as
to
what
had
been
said
in
this
tapped
telephone
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
conversation.
it
did
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
therefore,
our
concern
with
here
is
the
evidence
as
to
the
fruits
of
that
conversation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
that
is
all,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
what
you're
saying,
in
effect,
is
that
you
can
assume,
(a)
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute
through
--
by
interception,
(b)
a
divulgence,
there
would
have
been
a
violation
if
there
had
been
divulgence
of
the
intercepted
communication
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
it
does
not
follow
that
where
there
is
no
divulgence
as
embraced
in
the
statute
to
wit,
not
only
the
fruits
you
used,
it
doesn't
follow
that
--
that
there
should
be
an
inclusion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
so
sure
about
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
point
of
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
this
nardone,
too,
involved
a
divulgence
of
the
conversation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
the
fruits,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
weiss
against
united
states
that
holds
this
act
as
i
understand
it
applies
to
intrastate
communications
--
telephone
--
intrastate
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
wiretap?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
schwartz
against
texas
or
schwartz
against
united
states
cut
into
that
argument
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
it
says
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
violation
of
the
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
how
you
get
around
what
justice
black
pointed
out.
the
record
(inaudible)
here
we
got
the
court
of
appeals
saying
it
was
divulged,
what
difference
does
it
make
and
he
was
in
--
it
was
divulged
it
was
divulged.
you're
trying
to
use
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
fruits.
that's
the
difference
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
i
wonder
--
