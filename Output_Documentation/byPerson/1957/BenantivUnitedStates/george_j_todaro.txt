mr.
george
j.
todaro
may
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
transgress
on
the
previous
case
but
i
had
an
idea
with
regard
to
these
so-called
beeps
that
are
heard
on
the
telephone.
the
reason
for
it
is
to
indicate
to
the
other
party
to
the
telephone
that
there
is
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
a
tap
going
on
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
and
that's
a
very
obvious
reason
therefore
the
person
knows
that
there
is
a
telephone
message
being
tapped
in
an
indirect
manner.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
wanted
to
get
down
to
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
violating
the
federal
act
in
that
he
had
in
his
possession,
11
cans
of
alcohol
without
proper
stamps
affixed
thereto
and
in
transporting
those
11
cans
of
alcohol.
a
part
of
this
situation,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
the
police
of
the
state
of
new
york,
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
had
tapped
a
bar
known
as
the
reno
bar.
and
on
may
the
10th,
a
message
was
intercepted
wherein
the
petitioner
informed
someone
else
that
11
pieces
was
going
that
night.
the
officers
--
the
state
officers
thought
that
the
11
pieces
meant
11
pieces
of
narcotics,
and
following
that
interception
and
that
–
that
and
having
obtained
that
information,
they
followed
the
car
and
when
they
stopped
the
car
and
arrested
the
driver,
instead
of
11
pieces
of
narcotics,
they
found
11
cans
of
unpacked
alcohol,
thereupon
--
thereupon
turned
over
to
the
federal
authorities
for
prosecution.
now,
the
heart
of
this
question
--
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
statute
that
prohibits
both
interception
and
divulgence
of
a
telephone
message
and
which
goes
on
to
the
--
to
prohibit
the
--
the
use
of
intercepted
message
thus
it's
used
in
the
federal
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
every
case
that
i've
read
up
to
the
present
time
even
this
last
case,
the
rathbun
case.
they
started
with
the
principle
that
the
state
officer
could
not
testify.
otherwise
then
they
--
they
wouldn't
have
to
go
on
to
the
next
question
as
to
whether
it
constituted
an
interception.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
in
the
federal
court,
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
exactly
the
point
of
this
you're
here,
whether
a
state
officer
can
testify
in
the
federal
court
in
violation
of
605.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
now,
in
the
court
below,
the
court
stated
that
--
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
state
officer
was
acting
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
pursuant
to
a
warrant
of
the
state
of
new
york,
as
soon
as
he
testified
under
the
federal
court,
he
was
violating
the
federal
law,
605.
whether
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
j.
todaro
by
the
lower
court
in
this
case,
the
circuit
court
--
the
second
circuit.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that
it
was
alright
to
testify.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
it
was
alright
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
to
testify
but
he
said
that
as
soon
as
the
officer
testified,
he
violated
the
federal
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
statute.
now,
we
get
down
to
the
question
as
to
whether
a
state
officer
may
testify
in
a
federal
court.
we
know,
your
honors,
all
know
that
the
nardone
case,
the
first
nardone
case
and
the
second
nardone
case
have
answered
this
question
very
clearly.
in
the
first
nardone
case,
the
court
--
this
court
stated,
the
plain
words
of
605
forbid
anyone
unless
authorized
by
the
sender
to
intercept
the
telephone
message
and
direct
in
equally
clear
language
that
no
person
shall
divulge
the
message
to
any
person,
to
recite
the
contents
of
the
message
in
testimony
before
the
court,
is
to
divulge
the
message.
the
act
forbids
that,
such
testimony.
it
thus
does
becomes
a
--
a
play
with
words
if
we
say
that
the
nardone
represents
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
--
the
united
states
as
enunciated
by
this
court
that
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
this
particular
tap
was
made
by
state
officer
and
the
testimony
is
being
made
by
a
state
officer
that
it
puts
it
out
of
the
protection
of
605.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
the
statute
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
is
so
crystal
clear,
your
honor
that
it
can't
possibly
make
--
make
any
distinction.
the
statute
says
no
person,
not
being
authorized
by
the
sender
shall
intercept
and
divulge
a
communication
to
any
person.
now,
no
person,
to
my
mind,
is
zero
and
you
can't
make
anything
out
of
zero
but
zero.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct.
he
cannot.
that's
the
second
nardone
case.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh,
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
if
i
may
--
the
government
in
its
–-
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh,
we
have
not
only
the
fruit
we
have
the
whole
tree
and
the
conversation.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
this
is
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
government.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact,
the
facts
are
fully
recited
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court,
that
is,
the
second
circuit
court.
the
government
in
its
brief
here,
in
the
recitation
of
the
fact
states
as
follows.
“the
new
york
city
police,
believing
the
petitioner
and
his
brother
were
violating
state
law
by
dealing
in
narcotics,
obtained
a
warrant
to
tap
the
telephone
of
the
reno
bar
in
new
york
city,
frequently
used
by
the
benantis.
on
may
the
10th",
i'm
reading
from
page
6
of
the
government's
brief,
if
your
honor
please.
“on
may
10th,
1956
the
state
police
intercepted
a
message
between
petitioner
and
another
person
to
the
effect
that
11
pieces
was
to
be
transported
that
night.
so
there
was
an
interception
of
a
message
which
gave
the
police
a
clue
that
something
was
going
to
happen
that
night.
acting
on
this
information,
the
police
stopped
the
car
driven
by
the
petitioner's
brother,
angelo
benanti.
they
did
not
find
any
narcotics
but
did
find
eleven
five-gallon
cans
of
unpacked
alcohol.
federal
authorities
were
notified
and
this
prosecution
followed
and
it
may
be
of
interest
to
this
court
that
the
lower
court,
the
circuit
court
made
this
--
made
this
observation
in
--
in
its
decision.
but
it
is
equally
clear
that
what,
for
the
wiretap
there
would
have
been
no
basis
for
any
prosecution
whatsoever
as
the
apprehension
of
angelo
and
the
seizure
of
the
11
pieces
led
to
the
discovery
of
appellant's
participation
in
the
violation
of
the
federal
law
for
which
he
had
been
convicted
and
the
sequence,
of
course,
in
effect
is
clear.
there
is
--
this
is
an
(inaudible)
there
has
been
an
interception
and
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
or
the
tree
itself
was
brought
into
court
in
the
form
of
11
cans
of
alcohol.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may
say
–
we
--
we
went
up
on
--
on
a
very
short
statement
of
facts
here
because
the
u.s.
attorney
and
i
agreed
on
this
--
on
the
fact.
there
was
a
testimony
by
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
who
obtained
the
order
from
the
new
york
supreme
court
to
authorize
the
tap
of
this
reno
bar.
the
district
attorney
testified
for
the
conversations.
in
fact,
the
court
wanted
to
caution
me
not
to
have
it
brought
in
because
it
involved
the
word
narcotics.
you
understand?
and
the
district
attorney
testified
that
there
was
a
tap,
that
the
conversation
was
that
11
pieces
were
going
and
that
the
car
was
followed
and
they
said
they
found
11
cans
of
alcohol.
the
record
is
not
completely,
but
it's
conceded,
it
was
was
admitted
in
the
–-
in
the
lower
court.
it
was
so
agreed
that
the
u.s.
attorney's
brief
followed
the
same
principle
in
the
lower
court
and
the
lower
court
so
found
in
its
decision
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
the
government.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well
the
government
brought
--
it
meant
to
justify
the
--
the
tap
because
they
wanted
to
show
that
this
tap
was
authorized
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
the
government's
part
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
--
that's
the
government's
part.
so
though
factually,
there's
no
disagreement.
there
was
no
disagreement
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
there's
no
disagreement
(inaudible)
in
the
case.
and
the
brief
by
the
government
indicates
that
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
now,
in
answer
to
the
justice's
remark
with
regards
to
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
the
second
nardone
case
covers
that.
before
i
get
to
that,
in
the
first
nardone
case,
we
have
the
clue
and
the
answer
as
to
why
congress
passed
605.
and
this
court
stated,
the
answer
to
the
question
is
one
of
policy.
the
congress
may
have
thought
it
less
important
that
some
offender
should
go
on
with
the
justice
than
that
the
officers
should
resort
to
the
methods,
inconsistent
with
ethical
standing
--
standards
and
destructive
of
personal
limit.
now,
that
i
think
is
the
crux
of
the
thinking
beyond
congress
and
by
this
court
that
it
would
be
destructive
of
ethical
standards.
those
are
ethical
standards
that
congress
adopted
for
the
whole
of
the
united
states,
not
just
a
portion.
now,
in
the
second
nardone
case,
this
court
stated,
the
essence
of
a
provision
forbidding
the
acquisition
of
evidence
in
a
certain
way
is
that
--
that
merely
the
evidence
shall
not
be
used
before
the
court
but
that
--
that
it
shall
not
be
used
at
all.
that
it
is
no
evidence,
it
cannot
be
admitted
before
the
court
nor
can
it
be
used
at
all.
that
is
strong
language
by
this
court
and
it's
sound
language
because
it
intended
to
do
away
with
this
--
the
evils
of
wiretapping
and
that
it
intended
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
to
enforce
the
outcome.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
sir
definitely.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
and
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor
is
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
in
the
weeks
case,
the
violation
--
the
violation
involved
there
was
a
fourth
amendment,
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
and
the
unlawful
search
and
seizure
being
the
fourth
amendment,
the
first
eight
amendments
were
prohibitions.
they
were
limitations
rather.
they
were
imposed
on
the
federal
government
as
the
price
for
ratification
of
the
constitution.
those
were
limitation
imposed
on
--
upon
the
federal
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
government.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
says
that
--
that
the
evidence
c
shall
not
be
used
in
court,
that's
only
by
judicial
implication.
the
court
made
that
rule.
in
the
weeks
case
by
judicial
implication,
the
court
said
if
a
federal
officer
makes
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
it
shall
not
be
used
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
they
are.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that
is
correct
sir
and
the
lower
court
so
held
too.
judge
--
judge
medina
said
the
sooner
the
officer
testified
despite
the
fact
that
he
did
it
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
as
soon
as
he
divulged,
he
violated
the
federal
law.
and
there's
no
--
no
possible
doubt
as
to
that
because
the
statute
is
so
clear.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh,
no.
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
in
the
federal
court.
in
a
federal
court,
as
soon
as
the
officer
testifies
and
divulges,
he
is
committing
a
violation
of
605
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
in
other
words
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
and
--
and
i
say
justice
that
as
soon
as
the
officer
testified
in
--
in
the
court
and
divulged
the
conversation,
he
was
violating
section
605
of
the
communication
act.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
because
they
distinguished
it
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
mistake
they
made
is
they
--
that
they
likened
it
to
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
now,
unlawful
search
and
seizure
is
not
the
same
as
605.
605,
is
the
statute's
specific,
crystal
clear
and
admits
of
no
doubts
while
the
fourth
amendment
merely
said
that
no
--
no
the
--
the
home
of
the
person
shall
be
secured
against
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
evidence
ceases
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
it
cannot
be
used.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct.
i'm
referring
to
the
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct.
i'm
referring
to
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i'm
referring
to
wolf
versus
colorado
and
urban
versus
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
california.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that
was
a
federal
officer.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
right.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
but
the
weeks
case
was
federal
law.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no.
it
involves
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
the
federal
officers,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct.
now
--because
the
later
cases,
evidently
there
are
later
cases
mostly
where
the
search
is
made
without
authority
by
a
state
officer
and
the
state
officers
hand
the
stuff
over
to
federal
officers,
there
the
weeks
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
the
lustig
case.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
as
in
the
stemmer
case
but
this
doesn't
apply
to
--
to
605.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
correct.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
right
and
irvine
versus
california.
now,
there
are
some
question
with
regard
to
the
case
of
schwartz
versus
texas
and
that
is
being
urged
as
an
example
as
to
why
this
evidence
was
proper
--
properly
admitted.
but
there
is
a
distinction
in
schwartz
versus
texas.
in
that
case,
the
state
of
texas
prosecuted
the
petitioner
schwartz
for
a
state
crime
of
robbery.
the
officer
testified
to
a
telephone
conversation
which
was
intercepted.
one
of
the
confederates
in
that
particular
case
made
an
arrangement
to
have
a
telephone
call
with
schwartz
and
the
officer
would
listen
in
and
made
a
recording
of
that
conversation.
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
schwartz
objected
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
in
the
state
court
of
that
testimony
because
it
violated
605.
the
court
allowed
in
an
evidence
and
the
case
ultimately
came
up
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
where
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
of
course,
i
believe
mr.
justice
douglas
dissented
(inaudible)
in
that
case,
this
court
held
--
held,
we
hold
that
605
applies
only
to
exclusion
in
federal
court
proceedings
of
evidence
obtained
and
sought
to
be
divulged
in
violation
thereof.
it
does
not
exclude
such
evidence
in
a
state
court
proceeding
since
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
to
impose
a
rule
of
evidence
under
state
courts,
we
do
not
decide
whether
they
have
the
power
to
do
so.
mr.
george

todaro
schwartz
versus
texas,
344
u.s.
199.
the
question
can
only
arise
in
a
federal
court
proceeding.
therefore,
the
schwartz
case
clearly
indicated
that
had
this
officer
attempted
to
testify
in
the
federal
court,
he
would
not
have
been
permitted
to
do
so.
this
question
can
only
arise
in
a
federal
court
proceeding.
i
have
five
minutes
and
maybe
i
ought
to
retain
the
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
--
you
--
you
will
not
find
that
particularly
in
the
record.
this
was
a
short
record
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
but
we
stipulated
on
the
facts.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
and
if
your
honor
wishes,
i'll
get
a
further
--
i'll
get
--
i'll
obtain
the
other
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
there
is
no
dispute.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
there's
no
dispute
because
the
government
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
if
the
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
if
your
honor
will
read
page
6
of
the
government's
brief,
the
first
paragraph,
page
6.
i
think
that'd
answer
your
question
perfectly.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
the
first
paragraph
of
--
of
page
6.
the
new
york
city
police.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
it
turns
on
both
grounds.
it
really
would
make
no
difference
because
even
if
there
wasn't
a
divulgence,
the
very
fact
that
there
was
attack
made
and
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
605,
then
it
has
the
same
effect
under
the
second
nardone
case
it
would
apply.
but
here
there
was
a
conversation
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
but
this
involves
a
federal
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
this
involves
a
federal
court
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
with
a
federal
prohibition,
a
very
explicit
federal
prohibition,
605
which
there's
no
question,
shall
intercept
their
communication
or
divulge
its
content.
now,
on
this
--
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
your
honor,
this
is
very
clear.
the
--
the
--
the
government
says
on
may
the
10th,
1956,
the
state
police
intercepted
a
message
between
the
petitioner
and
another
person
to
the
effect
that
11
pieces
were
to
be
transported
that
night,
intercepted
a
communication,
a
message.
that's
very
plain
to
me
that
they
intercepted
a
conversation.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
perhaps
not.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
11
pieces
would
go.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
but
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well,
may
i
point
out
your
honor
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
the
circuit
court,
the
court
stated
but
if
it's
equally
clear
that,
but
for
the
wiretap
there
would
have
been
no
basis
for
any
prosecution
whatsoever.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
now,
if
your
honor
wishes
a
further
record
on
that,
i'll
be
glad
to
supply
it
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
it's
conceded
that
--
that
was
so
--
that
was
so.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
thank
you.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
think
that
there
was
the
--
the
question
of
divulgence
was
admitted
by
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
when
we
went
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
--
i'll
supply
a
copy
of
his
statement
on
appeal.
i
mean
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
where
they
concede
that
there
was
a
divulgence.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
believe
so.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i'd
agree,
though.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
section
605
also
states
as
follows
“or
they
use
the
same
or
information
therein
contained
for
his
own
benefit
or
for
the
benefit
of
another
that
entitled,
thereto,
making
use
of
the
information
obtained
if
they
have
to
use
of
the
information
following
the
--
the
bringing
in
the
matter
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
prosecution.
with
regards
to
the
record,
i
want
to
say
that
we
didn't
print
the
record
because
under
the
lustig
case,
i
believe
that
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
binding
upon
this
court.
now,
this
11
pieces
going
is
not
a
figment
of
an
imagination
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
you
have
it
all
before
you?
mr.
george
j.
todaro
(inaudible)
no.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
no.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
no.
that's
merely
a
certified
copy
of
the
record
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
that
is
--
there's
certification
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
has
it
got
testimony
of
mr.
murphy
you're
supposed
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
with
mr.
murphy
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
this
murphy,
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
testified
to
the
actual
divulgence
and
these
11
pieces
was
not
--
was
not
obtained
as
a
figment
of
the
imagination
of
anyone.
it
was
conceded
by
everyone.
the
u.s.
attorney
conceded.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
knew
that
that
was
brought
out
at
the
trial.
and
there
was
no
question
about
it.
even
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
refers
to
11
pieces
going
--
where
do
these
11
pieces
go
and
come
from?
it
took
part
during
the
trial
as
an
officer
of
the
court
would
make
a
statement
of
this
sort
unless
he
knew
that
it
happened.
now,
the
--
the
--
and
the
circuit
court
judge
in
his
review
of
the
facts,
page
3a
of
the
appendix
says
--
states,
“on
may
10th,
1956
by
listening
in
on
a
conversation
over
the
telephone
between
appellant
and
some
other
person,
the
state
police
learned
that
11
pieces
will
be
transported
that
night
at
a
certain
time
and
place
in
new
york
city.”
now,
this
is
just
medina
talking.
he'd
learned
that
--
he
states
that
the
police
learned
that
11
pieces
were
going.
well,
that
must
transpired
the
--
that
it'd
taken
place
during
the
trial
that
somebody
testified
11
pieces
were
going
that
--
that
night
and
that's
exactly
why
they
followed
the
car.
they
thought
they're
going
to
get
11
pieces
of
narcotic
instead
they
found
11
cans
of
alcohol.
now,
then
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
i
don't
think
there's
any
serious
dispute
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
this
conversation
--
that
this
tap
didn't
take
place,
that
this
conversation
wasn't
overheard
and
this
wasn't
testified
to
in
court.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
correct.
other
--
otherwise,
how
would
justice
medina
say
that
on
may
10th,
1956,
by
listening
in
on
a
conversation
on
the
telephone
between
the
appellant
and
some
other
person,
the
state
police
officer
learned
that
11
pieces
would
be
transported
that
night
at
a
certain
time
and
place
in
new
york
city?
having
heard
that
conversation
over
a
tapped
telephone,
they
followed
that
car
and
then
they
were
disappointed.
they
only
found
11
cans
of
alcohol
and
they
couldn't
make
an
arrest
for
narcotics.
now,
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
if
your
honor
wants
to
--
i
need
to
go
by
and
get
all
the
record
and
file
a
supplemental
brief,
all
right.
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
because
all
along
the
line,
the
u.s.
attorney
has
conceded
the
tap,
it
has
conceded
the
divulgence.
the
only
question
is
that
i
brought
out
the
tap.
sure
enough,
i
might
have
brought
it
out
when
i
questioned
the
police
officers
as
to
whether
there
was
a
tap
on
the
telephone
and
that
they
got
some
information
on
the
telephone.
and
having
got
that
information,
they
followed
this
car.
they
overheard
something
and
they
followed
the
car.
but
how
else
can
i
bring
about
--
how
else
could
i
proceed
under
the
second
nardone
case
it's
incumbent
upon
me
to
first
--
to
establish
that
there
was
a
tap.
now,
in
this
case,
if
your
honors
please,
i
have
exactly
10
minutes
preparation.
there
was
another
attorney
involved.
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
in
the
last
minute,
i
was
in
the
case
and
judge
walsh
wouldn't
consent
to
an
adjournment
and
i
borrowed
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
u.s.
attorney
to
--
to
proceed
with
the
trial.
i
know
nothing
about
the
case.
so,
when
i
got
up
to
cross
examine,
i
don't
know,
something
hit
me
maybe
there
was
a
wiretap
and
i
asked
the
foolish
question
and
just
expected
to
get
a
big
no,
when
i
got
a
big
yes.
and
then
i
had
something
to
--
to
play
ball,
start
the
cycle.
now,
with
regard
to
the
validity
of
the
statute
of
new
york
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
what
--
oh
yes.
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
that
during
the
trial
though.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
prior
to
that,
no.
no,
i
--
i
--
it
was
only
equivalent
to
10
minutes
with
that
case.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh
sure.
otherwise,
i
would
have
made
a
motion
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
to
suppress
it
via
divulgence,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
to
the
question
of
the
--
the
valid
--
the
conflict
between
the
state
law
and
the
united
--
in
605,
we
did
not
really
raise
that
issue.
the
government
raised
it.
i
presume
because
of
justice
medina's
ruling
that
the
--
as
soon
as
the
officer
testified,
he
violated
a
federal
act.
i'm
inclined
to
agree
with
the
court
below
because
the
two
--
two
statutes
are
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
and
both
cannot
survive.
one
is
destructive
of
the
other
because
one
says
no
person
shall
intercept,
and
it
doesn't
mean
except
the
office
of
the
state
of
new
york,
while
the
other
will
say,
we
may
intercept
under
certain
condition.
now,
this
is
a
law
of
general
application.
if
it
--
it
involves
the
whole
united
states.
it
does
not
exclude
the
state
of
new
york
from
its
--
from
abiding
by
it
and
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
cannot
put
congress
out
of
business
by
legislating
in
a
different
way.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they're
--
that
they're
diametrically
opposed
and
there's
a
be
conflict
that
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
policy
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
now,
may
i
add
and
close
here
that
there
have
been
repeated
attempts
made
to
outlaw
wire
--
that
is
to
amend
605
by
permitting
limited
wiretapping
by
congress.
and
the
omission
being
that
despite
the
pressure
from
our
--
some
of
our
governmental
agencies,
the
congress
of
united
states
has
refused
and
still
refuses
to
change
605.
now,
it
would
indicate
that
they
have
a
good
reason
why
they
don't
want
to
change
605.
and
on
--
if
congress
wishes
to
change
605,
and
permit
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
have
limited
wiretapping,
congress
can
certainly
do
it
by
passing
the
proper
act.
while
605
stands
at
--
this
now
that
no
person
shall
intercept
the
communication,
as
i've
said
before,
no
person
means
zero
and
zero
cannot
be
made
into
numerical
numbers
other
than
zero.
thank
you.
