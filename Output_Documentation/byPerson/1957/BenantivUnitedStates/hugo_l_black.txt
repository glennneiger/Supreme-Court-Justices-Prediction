justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
be
true
mr.
davis
if
the
evidence
was
or
the
statement
was
made
on
the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
the
intercepted
message
and
then
prove
what
was
in
it
and
why
was
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
judge,
in
passing
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
as
presented
to
us,
the
telephone
with
so-called
intercepted
the
messages.
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
--
why
would
the
judge
not
be
barred
just
as
much
as
though
it
had
been
presented
to
the
jury?
why
--
why
is
it
if
any
--
if
it's
wrong
to
present
it
as
evidence
to
the
jury
to
pass
on
the
guilt
from
innocent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
why
wouldn't
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
wrong,
to
present
it
to
the
judge
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
attempting
to
deprive
the
government
of
the
benefits
of
what
he
called
an
unlawful
disclosure.
and
the
only
way
he
could
judge
was
to
show
then
he
had
that
message
on
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
your
position
then
is
different
to
what
it
would
have
been
if
the
government
offered
it
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
mr.
davis
since
the
statute
does
require
a
rule,
what
do
you
say
about
what
judge
medina
said
on
page
4a
of
what
he
thinks
where
he
said
we
have
no
alternative
other
than
to
hold
by
tapping
the
wire,
interception
in
the
communications
made
by
a
telephone
and
divulging
at
the
trial
what
they
had
overheard,
the
new
york
police
officer
violates
the
federal
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
are
you
challenging
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
challenge
that
statement
in
your
brief?
it
is
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
rather
unusual
to
the
court
to
go
against
the
--
what
the
court
says
as
to
the
facts
of
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
(inaudible)
might
have
been
the
reason
why
you
have
the
statement
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
being
true,
wouldn't
we
have
to
accept
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
the
court
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
found
that
there
was
both
interception
and
divulgence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

at
the
court's
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
then
you
get
down
to
a
very
narrow
point.
if
you
--
if
you
are
--
if
you
have
to
live
with
this
record,
this
statement
then
it
seems
to
me
what
you
said
before
indicate
that
you
cannot
use
the
conversation
itself
even
though
by
a
state
officer
in
this
proceeding.
and
then
the
only
question
is
whether
the
fruits
could
be
used
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
say
that's
--
that's
all
there
is.
but
you're
--
you're
bound
by
this
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
was
our
fault
deciding
the
case,
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
thing
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
is
a
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals.
how
can
we
overlook
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
record
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
see
the
entire
record
here,
the
evidence
and
everything
that
transpired
at
the
trial
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
not
a
record
we'd
have
to
go
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
if
there
is
a
record,
we
could
look
at
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
they'd
testified
to
actually
what
they
overheard.
