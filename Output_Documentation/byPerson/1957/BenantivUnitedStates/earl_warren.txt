mr.

chief

warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
state
officer
could
not
testify
in
the
federal
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
so?
chief
justice
earl

yes.
chief

earl
warren
you
may
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time
if
you
wish
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
would
you
address
yourself
first
to
that
--
that
particular
question?
did
they
testify
at
the
trial
to
what
the
conversation
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
was
there
a
pretrial
motion
for
suppression
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
none.
only
--
only
an
objection
when
--
when
the
evidence
was
offered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
man,
an
employee
or
a
contractor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
employee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regular
employee
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
mr.
davis
that
instead
of
having
a
positive
law
such
as
new
york
had
permitting
officers
to
use
these
wiretaps
say,
they
have
the
policy
of
permitting
them
to
do
it
without
having
any
law
against
wiretap,
would
the
situation
be
the
same
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
then
they
couldn't
have
if
they
couldn't
have
a
policy
of
letting
them
do
it
by
a
lack
of
legislation
how
the
--
how
could
they
--
how
could
they
cure
the
situation
by
legislation
giving
them
the
affirmative
right
to
do
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
it's
in
conflict
with
--
if
it's
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
that
--
i
--
i
understood
you
that
it
would
--
you
thought
it
might
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
conflict
with
federal
law
if
they
have
no
statute
in
new
york
and
they
relied
on
--
on
the
policy
of
letting
--
letting
the
police
officers
do
it
by
way
of
not
prohibiting
it.
you
thought
that
would
be.
now
if
--
if
that
--
if
that
doesn't
help
them
how
will
the
statute
help
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
--
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
indicate
that
the
congress
intended
to
prevent
all
federal
officers
from
doing
this
and
all
citizens
but
intended
to
leave
local
law
enforcement
officers
free
to
violate
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
if
at
the
trial
either
it's
before
the
courts
or
before
the
jury,
one
of
the
officers
testified
to
this
conversation
so
far
as
11
pieces
are
concerned.
how
can
it
be
said
that
there
is
no
divulgence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
was.
it
was
there
and
it
was
a
divulgence,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
brought
the
fruits
of
it
--
of
it
there
and
wasn't
he
entitled
in
his
conscience
to
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
indeed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
was
this
divulgence
then
--
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
there
was
a
divulgence,
then
judge
medina
is
right,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
--
does
the
statute
say
that
it
shall
not
be
divulged
to
a
jury?
it
says
it
shall
not
be
divulged.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
you
--
when
you
bring
a
--
a
witness
into
the
case
and
--
and
produce
evidence
that
amounts
to
the
introduction
of
--
of
poisoned
evidence,
can
you
hide
behind
--
behind
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
don't
--
we
--
we're
not
responsible
for
any
divulgence
because
the
--
the
defendant
tried
to
show
and
did
show
that
it
was
illegally
obtained?

justice
earl
warren
mr.
