justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
--
who
put
the
district
attorney
on
the
stand,
the
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
government
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
government
questions
elicited
to
what
you've
now
told
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
whatever
the
reason
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
was
on
the
government's
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
the
result
came
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
todaro,
if
state
officers
were
guilty
of
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
stay
away
from
this
case
for
a
minute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
violate
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
weeks
says
that
they
may
testify
in
a
federal
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
trying
to
ask
you
now
try
to
distinguish
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
apart
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that,
were
the
state
officers
who
were
guilty
of
those
unlawful
searches
and
seizures,
do
they
violate
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
jury's
distinction
here
then,
that
the
state
officers
in
that
instance
are
not
guilty
of
violations
of
federal
law
were
as
innocent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
interception
of
the
telephone
call
was
a
violation
of
federal
law
even
though
authorized
under
state
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
what's
the
(inaudible)
then
that
the
evidence
is
nevertheless
admissible
but
the
state
--
that
the
state
officer
should
be
prosecuted
for
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
testimony
was
taken
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
also
had.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
allow
the
testimony
in
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i'll
come
back
to
it
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
unlawful
search
and
seizure
by
a
state
officer
a
violation
of
federal
law
or
not,
in
your
view.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
intercept,
you
say,
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
violation
of
federal
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
distinction
you
make
between
this
case
and
weeks,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
wrong?
i
thought
weeks
involved
both
federal
officers
and
state
officers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
do
rely
on
weeks,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
it
also
deals
with
state
officials.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
you
recognize
the
distinction
between
the
weeks
problem
that
it
concerned
the
state
officers
and
the
problem
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
there's
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
difference
in
results
they
rely
on
week's
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
said
as
to
federal
officers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
the
state
officers,
weeks
sanctioned
the
use
of
the
material
seized
by
state
officers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
you
concede
that
what
the
state
officers
did
in
the
weeks
situation
was
not
a
violation
of
federal
law
in
any
respect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
violation
of
federal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
mr.
todaro,
i
--
i
just
obtained
from
the
clerk
what
appears
to
be
all
there
is
of
a
record
submitted
and
included
in
it
is
your
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
a
--
in
a
brief
presented
but
apparently
with
all
of
the
testimony
that
those
two,
the
wiretap
and
all
the
rest
of
it
by
the
witnesses
we'll
call
it
transit
and
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seems
to
be
this
is
it.
did
that
have
all
of
that
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
the
whole
trial
record
but
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
seems
to
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
think
there's
all
the
testimony,
the
testimony
of
john
a.
francis
for
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
surnamed
(inaudible)
for
the
government
side.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
there
are
--
just
--
(voice
