justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
why
do
you
make
that
distinction?
the
weeks
case
wasn't
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
weeks
case
was
the
unlawful
arrest
and
the
unlawful
search
by
a
united
states
marshal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
whole
point
of
this
case
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
a
there
violation
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
told
me
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
weeks
wasn't
a
state
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
--
the
evidence
which
he
procured
illegally,
if
you
please,
sought
to
be
introduced
because
the
cases
are
all
the
other
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
the
weeks
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
search
and
seizure
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
illegal
--
may
–
but
rendered
illegal
by
state
law
and
not
by
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
see,
i've
just
read
what
the
crucial
thing
is.
the
united
states
marshal
went
in
and
searched
the
premises
without
a
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
does.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
weeks
off
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
in
there,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
your
court
accepts
this
colloquy
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
deny
that
they
intercepted.
but
he
wants
to
know
from
you
and
i
intervene
because
i'd
like
to
know,
too.
at
the
trial,
were
the
words
which
came
over
the
wire
those
words
themselves,
they
introduced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
maybe
that
page
6
of
the
government's
brief
would
indicate
to
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
goes
on
to
say
the
fact
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
search
came
as
a
result
of
a
telephone
interception.
it
doesn't
indicate
that
the
interception
of
mr.
davis
will
--
if
he
says
he
agrees
with
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
nearly
proves
that
--
that
doesn't
disapprove
that,
what
they
got,
that
the
consequence
of
the
interception.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
gave
them
a
lead
and
the
lead
gave
them
evidence
in
his
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
davis,
i
don't
see
how
that
helps
you
much
because
the
second
nardone
case
says
that
the
--
the
fruit
is
just
as
excludable
as
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
intercept.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
all.
i
don't
follow
you
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
too
said
you
can't
use
the
product
of
a
prohibited
605
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
question
that
bothers
justice
harlan
so
much
isn't
decisive
of
this
case
or
even
very
important
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
first
establish
that
there
was
a
violation
of
605.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
say
that's
immaterial
to
the
essential
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
--
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
605
was
violated
in
this
case
then
this
evidence
is
inadmissible
under
nardone
and
you
don't
prove
that
--
that
605
was
violated
by
the
inadmissibility
of
the
--
of
the
fruit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
we
get
weeks
straight?
both
of
you
rely
on
weeks.
i
intervened
in
when
your
brother
was
on
his
feet
that
weeks
that
when
we
say
weeks,
we
mean
the
doctrine
that
the
illegal
obtaining
of
evidence
by
a
federal
official
excludes
that
evidence
for
use
in
the
federal
court.
that
the
weeks
also
--
and
we
mean
that
--
that
as
against
that
--
the
fact
that
state
officials
not
collaborating
or
being
the
catch
for
or
acting
under
federal
authority
obtain
illegal
evidence.
it
does
not
exclude
the
evidence.
that's
--
that's
weeks
and
the
cases
that
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
couldn't
possibly
understand
why
your
opponent
relied
on
weeks
and
why
is
the
--
when
you
say
weeks
you
would
mean
the
cases
that
follow,
namely,
weeks
--
the
weeks
doctrine
is
a
week
of
exclusion
by
misconduct
on
the
part
of
federal
officials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
the
rest
follows
weiss
and
all
the
rest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
dealt
with?
i
don't
see
why
we
have
so
much
trouble.
the
court
said
that
–
it
has
said
that
whatever
the
illegality
now,
they
weren't
acting
under
federal
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
but
a
state
officer
who
--
who
breaks
in
a
house,
is
he
violating
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
clearly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
davis,
was
there
any
doubt
there
was
a
divulgence
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
in-trial.
was
there
any
doubt
that
what
they
got
from
the
--
what
they
heard
they
divulged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
but
they
must
have
in
order
for
the
--
the
truths
could
have
been
gathered
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
told
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
be
tipped
off.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
they
handed
it
over
to
federal
officials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
and
--
but
--
but
you
think
that
we
can
discuss
this
case
on
the
assumption
they
just
adhere
we
found
it
and
then
left
the
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it's
--
if
what
you've
said
is
so,
there
was
no
divulgence
here
and
all
you've
got
is
handing
over
to
the
federal
agency,
stuff
which
the
state
officials
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
why
all
of
these
problems
about
weeks
never
helped
them
to
decide,
if
that's
all
there's
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
there
was
no
divulgence,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
605.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
“might
well
be”
if
divulgence
has
to
be
a
necessary
part
and
the
record
is
barren
of
divulgence,
you
cannot
just
say
“there
might
be”
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
any
complying,
opening
the
door
to
say
“there
was
a
divulgence.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
was
no
divulgence,
assume
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
there
possibly
be
a
violation
of
605?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
interception
was
already
in
the
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
nardone
two
is
built
on
nardone
one,
this
is
all
the
prior
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
mr.
davis,
i
want
to
leave
you
a
little
uncertain
of
your
hesitation
--
this
hesitation
which
was
in
saying
there
could
be
a
violation
of
the
605
if
the
record
is
barren
of
a
fruit
of
divulgence
granting
there
was
an
interception.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
your
position
really
that
but
--
but
605.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
record
is
barren
of
--
of
an
interception
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
divulgence.
i
beg
your
pardon.
where
do
we
go
from
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
if
lower
courts
talk
that
way.
i
don't
know
anything
about
it
there's
all
the
more
reasons
for
getting
clarity
into
the
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
all
the
more
reasons
for
your
being
more
robust
than
you
are
in
standing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
that
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
don't
want
to
put
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
605
doesn't
say
or
doesn't
say
anybody
who
intercepts
(inaudible)
is
--
be
guilty
and
can
be
civilly,
sued,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can't
go
on
the
general
atmosphere
that
interception
is
bad
business.god
knows
nobody
thinks
worst
of
it
than
i
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
a
police
officer
had
said
or
asked
the
court's
ruling
not
to
--
to
be
allowed
not
to
answer
this
question
because
to
answer
it
would
commit
a
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
--
myself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
the
--
how
it
was
necessary
to
tell
that
there's
interception
in
order
to
tell
that
this
was
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
(inaudible)
the
policeman
might
say
i'm
--
i'm
familiar
with
the
law
and
i'm
--
my
--
my
lips
are
sealed
because
that
would
make
a
crime
which
heretofore
wasn't
a
crime
because
there's
been
no
divulgence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
look
at
the
record
and
see
if
it's
going
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
that
we're
borne
by
what
an
opinion
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

state
the
fact's
inaccurate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
big
of
a
transcript
is
this,
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
long.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it
is
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it's
--
his
--
his
admission
is
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they're
free
to
agree.
is
that
where
he
--
and
therefore
he
--
and
therefore
he
conceded
it?
when
you
say
he
conceded
it
on
appeal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
brief
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
department
of
justice
has
those
briefs
haven't
they
mr.
davis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
plus
also
what
justify
your
friend
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
reads
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
concession
by
the
u.s.
attorney
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
explains
--
that
explains
the
answer
to
the
question
of
--
the
chief
justice's
question.
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
that
explains
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
