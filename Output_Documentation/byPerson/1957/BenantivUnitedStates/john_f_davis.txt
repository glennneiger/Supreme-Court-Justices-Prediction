mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
on
direct
examination,
the
police
officers
were
called
to
testify
with
respect
to
possession
and
transportation
of
the
alcohol.
they
were
called
by
the
u.s.
attorney
on
the
direct
case.
when
the
government
got
through
with
the
direct
examination
of
the
first
police
officer
of
the
call,
mr.
todaro
on
cross-examination,
may
i
say
that
there
is
no
printed
record
in
this
case
as
it
came
up,
you'll
recollect
the
court
granted
certiorari
and
it
came
up
in
this
brief
quickly
so
there
is
a
transcript
--
this
is
what
i'm
reading
from
here
at
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
is
a
copy
of
the
transcript
which
is
on
file
with
the
clerk,
although
it
has
not
been
printed
because
of
no
--
no
opportunity
to
do
so.
then,
mr.
todaro,
on
cross-examination
said,
"officer,
you
were
in
the
vicinity
of
this
reno
bar
quite
frequently?"
"yes,
sir."
"did
the
police
department
have
a
tap
on
the
reno
bar,
if
you
know?"
and
the
police
officers,
"yes,
they
have
several
taps
on
the
reno
bar."
then
mr.
todaro,
on
--
as
a
basis
for
objecting
to
the
testimony
and
raising
his
objection
brought
out
this
information
with
respect
to
the
tap
and
there
is
no
question
that
when
the
next
officer
came
up
there
was
also
the
discussion
with
respect
for
the
tap.
this,
however,
was
not
a
part
of
the
government's
case.
it
didn't
help
to
prove
the
government's
case
anything
that
was
in
the
--
in
the
conversation.
it
was
brought
out
as
a
objection
as
the
basis
for
an
objection
to
receiving
the
evidence
in
that
--
the
information
in
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
was
a
--
the
language
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
about
the
11
pieces
was
disclosed.
now,
i
think
it
was
disclosed
for
the
judge
rather
than
for
the
jury
in
determining
whether
or
not
this
evidence
could
be
--
could
be
accepted.
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
the
11
pieces.
i
don't
think
it's
in
this
--
in
this
appendix.
i
think
that
was
in
the
discussion
with
the
--
with
the
court
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
as
to
--
by
the
police
officers
which
was
purported
to
be
obtained
from
the
lead
of
the
--
of
the
interception.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
that
had
been
--
if
that
had
been
the
case
it
would
have
--
then
you
would
have
a
disclosure
but
the
government's
case
wasn't
disclosure
of
the
messages.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
right.
this
--
this
language
the
--
the
11
pieces,
they
--
they
said
this
--
this
information
comes
from
a
tap
and
the
judge
said
let's
see
what
the
tap
was
and
he
went
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
--
if
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
is
wrong
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
if
it
is
not
wrong,
your
honor,
mr.
benanti
can't
object.
mr.
benanti
was
pressing
for
the
judge
--
was
pressing
for
the
judge
the
fact
that
the
government's
evidence
should
be
excluded
and
the
basis
that
he
was
saying
it
was
--
should
be
excluded,
was
because
there
has
been
a
telephone
tap
when
he
on
cross-examination
brought
out
there'd
been
a
tap
and
then
he
brought
this
information
to
the
judge
as
a
basis
for
the
exclusion
of
the
government's
case.
he
cannot
object
now
that
--
that
there
was
a
--
an
unlawful
disclosure.
he
was
attempting
–
attempting
to
--
too
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
that's
the
only
way
that
he
could
do
it.
and
that's
what
he
attempted
to
do.
but
now,
the
government
can't
be
taxed
with
the
disclosure
because
the
government
didn't
want
--
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
--
actually,
in
this
case,
your
honor
the
government
did
not
even
know
there
had
been
an
--
a
--
a
interception
of
these
messages
when
it
made
the
case.
it
was
until
cross-examination
and
the
defendant
brought
it
out
as
part
of
its
defense,
as
part
of
its
objection
to
the
interference
--
to
the
acceptance
to
this
evidence
that
the
united
states
attorney
knew
that
there'd
been
an
interception.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
that
would
have
certainly
been
a
different
case,
yes.
then
you
would
have
had
a
question
of
whether
there,
there
would
have
been
a
disclosure
if
you
please.
the
government
would
have
been
--
i
don't
say
that
would
have
answered
the
question
but
it
has
been
an
entirely
different
question
because
then
if
disclosure
in
the
court
is
a
violation
of
605,
the
united
states
would
have
been
involved
in
--
in
that
--
in
that
violation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
yes.
except
that
the
second
nardone
case
does
not
say
because
the
--
the
605
does
not
say
that
there
is
a
disclosure.
there
is
a
divulgence
when
fruit,
which
is
quite
different
from
the
message
when
the
fruit
is
used
in
evidence.
it
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
do
--
well
it's
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
todaro
said
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
605
in
this
court
by
the
divulgence
in
this
court
of
this
fruit.
and
i
say
whether
or
not
it
was
admissible,
it
was
not
a
violation
--
nothing
that
the
government
was
presenting
as
evidence
was
a
violation
of
605.
maybe,
if
you
apply
the
rule
of
the
second
nardone
case,
this
should
have
been
excluded
as
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
divulgence
–
an
illegal
wire-tapping.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
what
is
happening
in
court
is
itself
a
violation
of
605.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
immaterial
but
it
certainly
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
still
have
–-
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
we
still
have
a
case
to
decide.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
wanted
to
mention
weeks
because
there's
been
some
confusion
--
almost
all
of
weeks
deals
with
federal
officials
with
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
last
paragraph,
the
next
to
the
last,
except
for
the
result,
deals
with
a
seizure
by
policemen
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
local
policeman
and
weeks
itself,
is
the
origin
of
the
rule
that
seizures
by
state
police
would
--
state
officials
without
the
knowledge
or
concurrence
of
the
federal
officials
may
be
introduced
in
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
is
a
difference
because
the
weeks
case
deals,
of
course,
with
the
--
with
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
same
rule
shall
be
applied
to
the
refusal
to
accept
evidence
because
of
a
violation
of
605.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
do
rely
on
weeks.
we
say
that
in
the
--
in
the
wire-tapping
cases
in
general,
the
analogy
has
been
drawn
in
--
in
more
than
one
case
between
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
situation,
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
and
wire-tapping.
and
that
logically,
the
analogy
should
be
followed
through
with
respect
to
the
interception
by
the
state
officer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right
and
it
draws
the
distinction
with
respect
to
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that
is
--
that
is
right.
and,
of
course,
the
basis
--
the
basis
of
weeks,
as
i
think
the
basis
here,
could
be
that
as
justice
--
as
a
court
rule
of
--
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
--
to
keep
the
--
the
court
free
from
--
from
encouraging
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
we
said
we
won't
let
you
use
them
in
our
court
because
that
would
not
--
that
would
encourage
the
--
the
officers
to
--
to
make
illegal
searches
and
seizures.
if
you
--
if
you
slap
their
wrist
on
one
hand
and
then
use
their
evidence,
why,
you're
not
really
preventing
them
from
doing
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
been
said
as
to
federal
officers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
the
reason
is
--
the
reason
is
that
you
do
not
discourage
the
state
officers
from
carrying
on
their
state
activities
for
state
purposes,
if
you
exclude
it
from
--
from
federal
--
federal
courts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
no.
it
was
--
it
was
dealt
with
as
--
as
being
illegal
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
the
violation
of
--
of
--
as
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
now,
of
course,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
specifically
apply
that
to
federal
officials.
so,
it
doesn't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
what
--
yes,
that
is
right.
and
they
said
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he's
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
minute,
mr.
justice
burton.
but
i'm
assuming
for
a
minute
that
it
does
apply
to
state
officers.
i'm
assuming
that
605,
does
apply
to
the
state
--
to
--to
the
new
york
state
police
but
section
605
does
not
deal
--
congress
didn't
deal
with
the
introduction
of
the
--
of
the
information
in
evidence.
they
said
it
shall
be
a
crime.
and
the
question
is
should
it
be
received
in
evidence
even
assuming
that
it
was
illegally
obtained?
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
if
we
follow
weeks,
then
we
say
that
since
these
are
state
officials
that
are
involved
in
--
and
that
they
were
engaged
only
in
local
state
enforcements
that
it
can
be
used
in
a
federal
--
in
a
federal
court
even
assuming
it
was
illegally
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
taken.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
we
have
a
statute
but
in
the
weeks
case,
the
question
wasn't
the
legality
or
illegality
of
that
seizure.
it
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
an
appropriate
thing
to
present
it
being
introduced
in
evidence.
then
they
felt
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
exclude
it
from
evidence
when
only
a
state
official
was
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
would
say
even
assuming
and
i
will
come
to
a
minute
--
in
a
minute
to
the
question
whether
it
was
illegal
but
i
will
say
even
assuming
that
the
interception
was
in
violation
of
605
nevertheless,
it
can
be
received
in
evidence
because
on
an
analogy
to
the
weeks
case,
no
federal
official
was
--
was
involved
and
no
--
no
public
policy
is
--is
furthered
by
excluding
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
it's
not
a
--
those
--
if
--
if
we
did
have
a
divulgence
so
that
there
was
a
crime
being
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
past
violation,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
which
has
taken
place
in
the
past.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor
if
there
were
a
divulgence
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that's
right.
and
i
--
i
understand
that
--
that
point
and
i
say
it
would
be
a
different
question
if
the
divulgence
did
appear
in
the
court
room
because
there
you
would
have
the
court
sanction
--
sanctioning
a
violation
--
a
current
violation
of
--
of
605
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
and
then
--
and
then
i
think
follows
from
weeks
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
lustig
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
the
other
cases
which
follow
which
say
that
this
rule
of
exclusion
shouldn't
be
applied
when
the
federal
officials
are
not
involved.
and
when
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it's
not
so
much
whether
they're
state
or
federal
officials
really.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
they
were
going
--
they
were
involved
in
federal
law
enforcement
at
the
time.
one
doesn't
prevent
people
from
continuing
to
do
the
--
their
local
law
enforcement
by
excluding
the
information.
all
they're
doing
is
--
is
penalizing
themselves
in
a
particular
case
if
they
exclude
it.
it
doesn't
accomplish
anything.
it
doesn't
prevent
the
state
local
--
the
local
officials
from
continuing
this
activity.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
wasn't
any
divulgence
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
but
there's
no
indication
that
they
divulged
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
individual
officers
who
--
who
listened
under
the
state
--
under
the
state
order
went
out
and
--
and
stopped
the
trial
and
arrested
the
people.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
until
mr.
mr.
todaro
asked
the
questions
as
to
what
happened
in
order
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i'm
not
sure
they
divulged
it
at
any
time.
they
went
--
they
--
they
heard
that
the
--
that
the
car
was
going
to
be
moving
with
11
pieces
and
they
went
out
and
arrested
the
man.
the
very
--
the
man
that
listened.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
handed
the
alcohol
--
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
--
the
case
over
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
the
--
not
the
interception
which
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
found
this
man
carrying
alcohol.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
the
–
that's
the
--
as
far
as
we
know,
the
federal
officials
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
wiretap.
there's
no
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
reason
why
they
should
have
known
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no
there
was
none.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
in
that
i'm
not
sure
that
there
could
have
been
because
i
don't
know
that
--
that
the
--
the
counsel
who
was
called
in
late
had
any
information
as
to
what
the
case
was
going
to
be
and
tell
them
there's
a
trial
until
he
heard
it.
i'm
not
--
i
think
that
this
might
be
a
situation
where
the
object
--
objection
had
to
be
made
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
the
claim
of
the
petitioner
here
is
that
the
lead
--
the
lead
which
led
--
which
resulted
from
the
arrest
came
from
wiretapping.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
i
think
the
exception
is
might
well
be.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
couldn't.
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
has
to
be
an
interception
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
divulgence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
nardone
two,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
except
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
was
no
discussion
in
nardone
two
of
--
of
divulgence.
there
can
be
no
question
that
many
people
knew
of
the
contents
of
these
intercepted
telephone
messages
in
nardone.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
i'd
like
to
move,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
605
because
if
there
was
no
violation,
then
we've
--
we
have
none
of
these
problems.
the
new
york
statute
is
specific
that
--
it's
--
it's
found
in
its
constitution
and
its
code
of
criminal
procedure
and
it
specifically
provides
for
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
by
a
court
on
application
under
oath
showing
probable
cause
of
the
necessity
of
intercepting
telephone
message.
the
length
of
time
which
the
warrant
can
be
used
is
--
is
limited
by
statute.
it
was
under
this
particular
application,
under
this
particular
law
that
this
new
york
city
police
made
this
interception.
they
did
apply
to
the
new
york
court.
they
got
a
warrant.
they
listened
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
so,
this
case
raises,
very
squarely,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
new
york
procedure
is
outlawed
by
section
605
of
the
--
of
the
communications
act.
now,
it's
also
clear
that
section
605,
in
language,
covers
everyone.
if
it's
to
be
read
literally,
it
applies
to
the
judge
who
issues
the
warrants
and
the
policeman
who
--
who
listened
to
the
call
because
it
makes
no
exception
for
--
for
anybody.
but
in
dealing
with
a
problem
of
balancing
federal
and
state
legislation,
this
intergovernmental
problems,
it
is
not
infrequent
to
--
for
the
court
to
interpret
what
appeared
to
be
blanket
prohibitions
so
as
to
permit
the
states
to
apply
their
local
policies.
let
me
give
you
an
example,
an
old
example.
there's
been
on
the
statute
for
many
years
a
law
which
says
that
nobody
shall
interfere
with
the
--
the
carriage
of
the
mails.
many
years
ago
in
philadelphia,
the
local
law
officials
found
a
man
driving
sleigh
down
chestnut
street
without
any
bells
on
the
sleigh
and
proceeding
in
an
unlawful
rate
of
speed.
and
the
local
law
official
arrested
the
mail
carrier.
and
the
question
came
up
before
justice
washington
sitting
on
the
circuit,
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
blanket
prohibition
against
the
interference
with
the
mail
covered
the
--
this
interference
by
the
local
law
official.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
was
an
employee
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
mean
he
was
a
regular
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
as
far
as
it
appears,
he
was
a
regular
employee.
at
least
there's
nothing
in
the
case
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
any
--
anything
different.
this
case
that
i
refer
to
was
the
united
states
against
hart
and
i
quote
on
page
16
of
our
brief
from
justice
washington's
construction
of
the
act
to
say
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
apply
the
act
with
this
kind
of
a
stoppage.
now,
that's
an
old
case.
there's
been
more
recent
cases
that
--
that
apply
the
same
thing.
one
fairly
recent
case
is
the
penn
dairies
case,
penn
dairies
against
milk
control
commission
in
318
united
states
where
there
was
a
blanket
law
that
said
that
military
installation
should
buy
their
--
their
supplies
by
competitive
bidding.
it's
a
blanket
regulation.
the
question
of
--
which
arose
here
was
whether
the
penn
dairies
which
was
subject
to
a
local
law
as
to
milk
control,
setting
prices,
whether
they
--
whether
the
--
the
competitive
bidding
requirement
apply.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
i
am
not
--
my
argument
--
all
right
so
i
got
to
accept
it
that
i
mean
it
--
it
is
the
law
and
--
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
i
am
taking.
in
--
it's
been
possible
to
--
to
separate
interstate
and
intrastate
communications
over
an
interstate
system
as
the
telephone
system
is.
and
when
there
is
wiretapping,
it
maybe
interstate
and
it
maybe
intrastate
and
605
applies
to
both,
at
least
this
section,
this
clause
of
605
applies
to
both.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
local
state
officials
may
not
be
exempted
from
the
prohibition
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
even
suggesting
that
they
are
limited
to
the
interception
of
intrastate
communications
because
when
they
listened
under
one
of
these
warrants,
they
can't
tell
whether
it's
going
to
be
intrastate
or
interstate
that
they
are
intercepting.
but
what
they
are
doing
is,
in
--
in
pursuant
to
the
new
york
state's
provisions
for
law
enforcement
and
pursuant
to
a
warrant
of
the
court,
they
are
in
new
york
and
without
preventing
the
--
the
system
from
operating,
they
are
listening
in
on
interstate
or
intrastate
messages
to
this
--
to
this
bar.
this,
we
say,
since
it
is
pursuant
to
a
local
law
enforcement
policy,
is
not
forbidden
by
605
of
the
--
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
schwartz
against
united
states
says
that
--
no,
it's
schwartz
against
texas.
schwartz
against
texas
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
state
of
texas
may,
in
--
in
its
courts
--
in
its
courts
--
in
its
(inaudible)
trials
may
use
evidence
which
is
obtained
by
federal
officers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
violation
of
605
of
the
act.
well,
but
not
under
any
specific
authority
of
--
of
law,
of
congress.
may
i
say
this,
that
the
nardone
case
itself,
the
first
nardone
case
says
that
there
is
no
--
that
it
applies
to
law
officials,
as
to
others
that
the
prohibition
does,
applies
across
the
board
to
everybody.
but
it
was
not
there
dealing
with
a
case
of
any
specific
government
authority
to
intercept,
as
we
have
in
this
case.
in
nardone,
the
--
the
officers
were
--
were
intercepting
as
part
of
their
law
enforcement
but
without
any
--
they
were
federal
officers
and
obviously
there
was
no
specific
authority
given
to
them
to
--
to
intercept.
so,
we
feel
that
--
that
the
--
the
fact
that
this
legislature
of
new
york
and
specifically
dealt
with
this
problem,
considered
that
it
is
necessary
to
their
local
law
enforcement,
should
lead
this
court
to
consider
very
carefully,
whether
or
not
these
two
laws
can
be
reconciled
or
whether
they
are
irreconcilable.
if
they
are
irreconcilable,
of
course,
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
must
control
and
the
--
the
constitution
and
the
law
of
--
of
new
york
must
be
held
invalid.
but
one
doesn't
arrive
at
a
conclusion
like
that
if
it
is
possible
by
construction
to
--
to
let
both
of
them
stand
together.
in
passing
the
communications
act,
congress
was
very
--
was
very
insistent
that
the
state's
interest
in
telephone
communications
should
continue
to
be
recognized
that
it
felt
this
was
a
--
this
was
--
and
utility
in
which
they
were
both
federal
and
state
aspects
and
that
the
federal
government
–
that
the
congress
was
very
careful
not
to
preempt
the
entire
field.
they
said
we
want
to
save
for
the
states
certain
amount
of
regulation
and
certain
amount
of
--
of
local
autonomy.
and
it
seems
entirely
consistent
with
--
with
that
general
policy,
although
they
didn't
deal
with
this
problem
--
specific
problem
before
united
states,
specifically.
it
seems
only
consistent
with
that
if
they
would
have
intended
that
a
local
law
permitting
interception
under
court
warrant
would
be
--
should
be
--
should
be
legal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
would
be
much
closer
to
the
nardone
case
itself.
it
would
be
possible
in
a
--
in
--
in
that
case
to
--
to
draw
a
distinction
when
you
have
a
state
official
doing
it
in
accordance
with
the
state
policy.
but
by
and
large,
the
first
nardone
case
says
that
law
officials,
like
anybody
else,
would
be
subject
to
the
act.
and
i
think
it'd
be
a
very
difficult
case
if
you
didn't
have
the
specific
authority.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
can
only
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
is
in
conflict
with
this
federal
law,
they
cannot
do
it.
it's
a
question
of
interpreting
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
federal
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
would
only
help
them
if
we
would
construe
605
to
mean
that
congress
couldn't
have
intended
to
prevent
the
states
from
dealing
with
a
local
problem
of
this
kind
through
legislation.
i
am
urging
that
it
is
possible
as
in
this
other
cases
by
implication
to
--
just
to
--
to
find
a
--
a
authority
to
the
states
to
legislate
in
this
field.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
there's
no
--
there's
no
indication
of
any
such
intent
on
the
part
of
congress.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
don't
hesitate
because
i
have
any
question
as
to
about
what
--
about
our
position
that
there
has
to
be
both
an
interception
and
a
divulgence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
605,
says
that.
there
must
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
interception
and
divulgence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
divulgence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
there
can
be
no
violation
but
that
i
think
that
in
--
the
reason
that
i
--
that
i
have
difficulty
with
that
case,
this
situation,
is
that
--
that
some
of
the
language
of
the
court
in
dealing
with
this
problem,
deals
with
wiretapping,
as
such,
as
being
an
underhanded
bad
business.
i
think
it
comes
from
reading
the
--
the
dissents
--
the
dissents
in
the
--
on
--
on
the
original
olmstead
case.
and
so
one
has
a
feeling
that
if
there
is
this
kind
of
--
of
interception
in
the
case
that
we
have
a
problem
as
to
the
--
the
reception
of
the
evidence
and
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
--
well
i
can
assure
your
honor
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
can
assure
your
honor
that
there's
no
--
there
is
no
hesitation
on
my
part
on
that
--
on
that
issue.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
it's
clearly
our
position
that
there
must
be
both
interception
and
divulgence
before
there's
a
violation
of
605.
there
must
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
does
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
the
statute
requires
both
and
--
and
so
far
--
so
far
as
i
can
ascertain,
there's
no
--
nothing
in
this
record
with
respect
to
divulgence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
what
judge
medina
said.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
find
no
evidence
of
any
divulgence
at
the
trial
except
as
i
had
explained
to
the
court
as
a
basis
for
objecting
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
we
have
not
--
we
have
not
mr.
justice
black,
we
haven't
argued
in
our
brief
in
this
case
and
quite
frankly
until
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pressed
me
on
this
one.
i
hadn't
realized
the
importance
of
this
to
the
--
to
the
case.
we
haven't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
argued
the
absence
of
divulgence
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
--
one
reason
--
one
reason
that
--
that
this
comes
up
and
--
and
maybe
without
proper
preparation
is
that
we
don't
have
any
proper
record
in
this
case
because
of
the
way
this
thing
comes
to
this
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
--
well
we'd
--
you
have
before
you
the
transcript
of
the
proceeding
below
which
--
which
will
show
you
everything
that
was
--
i
mean
there's
no
question
as
to
what
went
on
at
the
trial.
that
transcript
is
on
file
with
the
court.
so
there's
no
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
makes
that
remark.
i
don't
know
whether
his
mind
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
certainly
in
the
court's
opinion
whether
it's
a
conscious
weighing
of
any
evidence
or
whether
it's
a
--
an
assumption,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that
that
would
have
been
a
divulgence
of
that
information,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
i
--
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
the
petitioner
--
the
petitioner
can
now
object
because
on
cross-examination
in
opposing
the
in
--
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
can
object
because
he
brought
out
a
message
of
this
kind.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
certainly
wasn't
entitled
to.
that
was
the
only
way
that
he
could
challenge
it
and
that's
the
way
he
did
challenge
it.
but
that
doesn't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
mean
that
the
government
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
a
divulgence
in
the
sense
that
should
exclude
the
evidence
from
the
--
from
the
--
should
result
in
an
--
sa
violation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
there
was
a
violation
by
the
police
officer
in
--
in
answering
this
question
in
court,
if
there
was
such
a
violation,
it
is
not
attributable
to
the
government.
it's
attributable
to
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
cannot
then
object
to
be
introduced
and
introduction
of
some
other
evidence
on
the
ground
that
he
caused
the
divulgence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
not
trying
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we're
not
trying
to
hide
behind
it,
your
honor.
we
think
we
had
an
entire
right
to
challenge
this
evidence
and
to
bring
out
this
--
and
to
bring
this
out
before
the
court.
i
mean
he
had
to
say
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
in
order
to
challenge
it
he
couldn't
do
anything
else.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
[laughs]
it
would
--
it
would
be
an
impossible
situation.
i
mean
there'd
be
no
way
--
that
would
mean
there
would
be
no
way
of
challenging
--
challenging
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence.
if
you
couldn't
talk
--
maybe
you
didn't
have
to
tell
the
details
of
the
conversation.
maybe
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
say
there
was
wiretapping.
maybe
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that
wouldn't
be
a
divulgence
with

of
the
message.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
wanted
to
find
out
whether
this
resulted
from
the
interception.
and
in
order
to
find
out
whether
this
seizure
resulted
from
the
interception,
they
have
to
find
out
what
was
said
in
the
interception
and
that's
why
these
questions
were
asked.
and
whether
it
was
proper
or
whether
it
wasn't,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then
we
would
come
down
to
the
question
of
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
showing
that
there
is
a
connection
between
the
evidence
and
the
--
and
the
alleged
interception
whether
it
is
the
objector
or
whether
it's
the
--
the
government.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
but
i'm
not
trying
to
use
anything
that
was
divulged,
your
--
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i'm
not
--
yes.
what
[laughs]
--
what
i'm
trying
to
--
what
we're
trying
to
use
is
the
evidence
which
occurred
before
that
and
if
there
was
divulgence,
it
was
divulgence
which
the
petitioner
cannot
obtain.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
sure.
i
--
i
think
we're
bound
by
--
by
the
transcript
which
is
before
you
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
--
of
what
actually
occurred.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
there's
no
--
if
there's
no
word
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
record
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
there's
no
word
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
actually,
you
see
--
actually,
your
honor,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
consideration
in
our
brief
and
of
--
so
far
as
i
know
it
until
this
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
prior
divulgence
in
this
case.
i
mean
we
had
assumed
that
there
were
two
issues
in
this
case,
one,
an
illegal
act
by
the
state
officials
under
605
and
whether
still
the
evidence
should
be
admissible
or
two,
that
the
act
was
not
illegal
because
it
was
--
it
was
justified
by
the
state
--
by
the
state
constitutional
laws.
this
additional
issue
which
has
now
arisen
is
something
which
is
confused
on
--
on
the
record
in
view
of
judge
medina's
statement
and
can
only
be
ascertained
by
reading
the
--
the
transcript
itself.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
not
long.
mr.
john
f.
davis
is
it
found
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
well
in
fact
if
the
transcript
itself
found
is
the
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
we
have
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
nothing
has
been
certified
when
the
petition
--
of
course
when
the
petition
was
filed
in
this
case
as
is
usual
and
now
that
the
--
just
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
--
is
made
in
the
appendix
to
the
--
to
the
petitioner.
when
it
is
granted
by
then
generally
a
record
is
printed.
of
course,
there
was
no
time
to
print
a
record
and
i
am
not
--
i
haven't
checked
but
i
do
not
know
whether
there's
even
a
certified
copy
of
the
transcript.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
i
have
referred
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you'd
have
to
accept
it
for
the
(voice

--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
anything
conceded
