in
a

of
a

which
is
on
your
hypothesis
involved
under
the

justice
tom
c.
clark

to
justice
burton
that
you
were
assuming
that
there
was
a
violation
as
to

justice
tom

--the
statute.
justice
tom
c.

there
is
a
violation
of
the

justice
tom
c.

it's
a
violation

so
hard
as
to
whether
the
communication
was
divulged.
