mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
companion
case
to
the
preceding
case,
the
lawn
case
which
was
argued
yesterday.
mr.
striker
who
represented
mr.
lawn
also
represented
these
two
petitioners
at
the
trial
at
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
giglio
and
livorsi,
were
found
guilty
on
each
count
in
which
they
were
named
as
the
defendants
of
a
ten-count
indictment.
the
indictment
and
substance
charged
violations
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
relating
to
the
year
1946.
giglio
was
named
as
a
defendant
in
eight
counts
and
livorsi
in
four
counts.
each
of
the
petitioners
was
sentenced
to
a
total
term
of
15
years.
i
would
like
first
to
address
myself
as
to
whether
the
defendants
were
wrongfully
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
ascertain
whether
tainted
evidence
was
used
against
them
at
the
trial
or
in
order
to
indict.
in
1950,
three
years
before
the
present
indictment
was
filed,
three
informations
were
filed
charging
the
petitioners
and
mr.
lawn
with
violations
of
the
internal
revenue
laws
pertaining
to
the
year
1946.
the
defendants
pleaded
not
guilty
to
those
informations.
the
case
was
later
marked
off
the
trial
calendar
and
the
investigation
by
the
internal
revenue
agents
was
continuing.
in
1952,
about
july,
while
this
case
was
still
pending,
while
these
men
were
still
defendants
in
a
criminal
income
tax
prosecution,
the
petitioners
were
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
when
mr.
livorsi
appeared
there,
he
was
not
advised
by
the
government
as
to
any
constitutional
rights
he
had,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
be
brought
before
the
grand
jury
or
whether
or
not
he
might
refuse
to
answer
any
questions.
when
the
petitioner
giglio
was
brought
before
the
grand
jury,
he
on
12
occasions
asserted
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
he
was
then
brought
before
district
judge
t
hyot
davis
and
the
assistant
asked
that
he
be
held
in
contempt.
at
that
time,
i
will
read
just
a
short
part
or
part
of
that
hearing,
it's
on
page
nine
of
the
original
brief,
“the
court
asked
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,”
i'm
quoting
from
the
record
at
2824.
the
court,
“well
he
is
being
investigated
himself?”
mr.
leone,
the
prosecutor,
“these
various
companies
are
being
investigated
your
honor.”
the
court,
“the
defendant
himself
is
not
under
investigation.”
mr.
leone,
“well,
it
is
a
john
doe
investigation,
and
the
witness
appeared
in
response
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.”
the
court,
“i
see.”
mr.
leone,
“the
witness
was
asked
to
produce
certain
records
of
certain
companies
and
it
has
been
established
that
he
was
either
a
partner
in
some
of
these
companies
or
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
corporation.
now
the
investigation
is
a
john
doe
proceeding
and
it
might
very
well
be
that
in
time
he
would
be
a
subject
of
an
investigation.
i
don't
say
that
he
is
not,
but
at
the
present
time
these
companies
are
under
investigation
your
honor.”
the
court
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
for
a
period
of
two
years,
your
honor,
which
they
had
pleaded
not
guilty
and
was
pending.
the
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
the
defendants?
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
yes
your
honor,
they
pleaded
not
guilty
to
this
information
and
in
fact
when
mr.
giglio
was
before
judge
davis
he
pointed
out
to
judge
davis
that
he
was
a
defendant
in
a
pending
criminal
income
tax
prosecution.
judge
davis,
however,
directed
him
to
produce
all
of
these
books,
including
the
partnership
records
and
to
return
to
the
grand
jury
and
to
answer
the
questions.
under
fear
of
contempt
he
did
so.
he
was
brought
before
the
grand
jury
on
five
or
six
occasions.
he
produced
about
80
cartons
of
partnership
records
which
were
pertinent
to
this
investigation
and
turned
all
of
those
over
to
the
government.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
your
honor,
judge
davis
was
a
visiting
judge
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
the
prior
case
and
it
wasn't
until
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no,
there
was
no
counsel
in
the
courtroom.
this
was
brought
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
but
later
on
the
defendant
did
tell
judge
davis
that
he
was
under
this
prosecution,
but
judge
davis
didn't
pay
any
heed
to
that.
but
in
the
beginning
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
may
i
say
this,
judge
you
asked
me
if
i
had
--
if
giglio
was
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
represented
by
an
attorney
at
that
time,
but
that
attorney
was
in
court
at
the
time
of
this
proceeding.
in
fact
he
was
excluded
by
the
government
and
the
court.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
he
had
been
excluded
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
being
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
now
if
the
court
please
in
the
southern
district
when
they
bring
defendant
or
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
and
he
refuses
to
answer
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no,
his
lawyer
was
excluded
before
the
court,
when
the
witness
or
it
was
the
defendant
was
brought
before
the
court,
only
members
of
the
grand
jury
were
permitted
to
be
present
and
the
witness
and
a
stenographer
and
the
assistants.
no
other
persons
representing
the
defendant
were
allowed
to
be
present.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
he
was
not
given
a
lawyer
at
this
time,
because
there
had
been
no
instructions
up
to
this
time
that
he
answered
questions.
no
instruction
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
now
in
1952,
or
shortly
after
he
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
on
these
several
occasions
and
produce
these
80
cartons
of
records,
an
indictment
or
six
indictments
were
filed.
those
six
indictments
contained
ten
counts
in
all
respects
similar
to
the
ten
counts
contained
in
the
present
indictment,
except
for
a
few
variations
as
to
figures.
after
that
mr.
stryker
moves
before
judge
goddard
to
inspect
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
basis
that
these
defendants
had
been
compelled
to
be
brought
before
a
grand
jury
and
give
testimony
on
threats
of
contempt
when
at
the
time
they
were
defendants
in
a
pending
criminal
income
tax
matter.
judge
goddard
at
first
granted
the
motion
to
inspect
the
grand
jury
minutes
of
the
defendants.
he
thereafter
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
in
the
meantime
the
government
appealed
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no
not
directly,
not
directly
at
that
time,
your
honor,
although
judge
goddard
in
his
opinion
stated
that
it
was
an
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
do
so,
but
the
motion
was
not
made
at
that
time
for
that,
as
to
the
1952
indictment.
now
the
government
appealed
from
judge
goddard's
order
and
in
the
meantime
before
the
appeal
was
dismissed
as
being
untimely,
the
government
procured
this
instant
indictment
in
the
summer
of
1953,
which
after
it
was
filed
was
order
sealed.
when
the
circuit
court
denied
or
dismissed
the
government's
appeal
from
judge
goddard's
order
as
being
untimely,
then
in
january
of
1954
this
present
indictment
was
ordered
open.
after
that
mr.
stryker
then
moved
before
judge
palmieri,
and
at
this
time
he
moved
to
dismiss
the
--
for
the
inspection
grand
jury
minutes,
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
asked
for
a
hearing.
he
moved
also
to
suppress
evidence
and
asked
for
a
hearing,
so
that
the
extent
of
the
evidence
and
the
clues
and
leads
which
were
obtained
from
tainted
evidence
could
be
determined,
both
for
the
purposes
of
trial
and
also
for
the
purposes
of
an
attack
on
the
indictment
itself.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
appears
at
page
26
of
the
record
if
the
court
please
–
at
27.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
which
had
been
submitted
by
the
government
agents,
judge
palmieri
denied
that
motion
and
also
stated
that
there
had
been
no
foundation
laid
by
the
defendants,
despite
the
fact
if
the
court
please
that
the
defendants
had
established
that
this
evidence
had
been
obtained
contrary
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendants
and
that
it
had
been
used
in
the
1952,
before
the
1952
grand
jury,
and
even
though
when
the
motion
was
made
before
judge
goddard
as
to
the
1952
indictment,
the
prosecutor
mr.
leone
categorically
denied
that
any
such
evidence
had
been
used.
subsequently
in
the
argument,
in
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
wessel,
who
was
then
in
charge
of
the
prosection,
admitted
that
indeed
the
fact
was
certain
evidence
and
clues
and
leads
had
been
used
before
the
1952
grand
jury.
just
on
the
basis
of
these
affidavits
judge
palmieri
denied
the
defendants
a
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
yes
your
honor
i
believe
at
--
oh
not
at
the
trial,
no
i'm
talking
about
before
the
1952
grand
jury,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no
just
it
was
admitted
subsequently,
although
denied
originally
that
anything
had
been
used
before
the
1952
grand
jury,
it
was
subsequently
admitted
that
there
had
been
tainted
evidence
used
before
the
1952
grand
jury.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
in
obtaining
the
1952
indictment,
but
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
right
your
honor,
but
the
government
has
always
contented
that
no
tainted
evidence
was
used
before
the
1953
grand
jury.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that's
the
correct
indictment.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no
admission
at
all.
in
fact
on
the
contrary
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
we're
contending
that
we
under
your
honor's
ruling
and
this
court's
ruling
in
nardone
case
show
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
right
and
showed
that
the
government
had
a
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
yes,
compiling
the
defendants
to
testify.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
that
it
does
not
necessary
automatically
follow,
but
that
the
fact
is
these
indictments,
as
judge
palmieri
stated,
have
a
deadly
parallel,
and
that
i
think
enough
evidence
had
been
established
by
the
defendants
for
at
least
a
hearing,
where
they
would
be
given
an
opportunity
to
show
whether
or
not
tainted
evidence
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
think
mr.
stryker
throughout
the
trial
as
well
as
when
it
was
argued
before
judge
palmieri
claimed
that
and
claimed
that
the
burden
--
even
if
he
has
the
burden
to
show
that
there
might
be
tainted
evidence
used
in
the
1953
indictment,
he
was
at
least
entitled
to
a
hearing
where
he
could
bring
witnesses
who
would
have
some
knowledge
of
that,
before
the
court,
to
see
whether
or
not
such
evidence
was
used
at
all
and
then
the
burden
would
shift
if
it
hadn't
already
shifted
to
the
government.
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
of
the
clues
and
leads,
that
is
right
your
honor,
he
certainly
was.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no
he
denied
the
hearing.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
on
the
basis
of
these
affidavits
submitted
by
government
agents.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
i
don't
believe
that's
a
hearing
when
the
defendants
are
not
able
to
put
in
any
evidence
and
that
would
be
evidence
by
government
agents
who
would
be
the
only
people
or
the
prosecutor,
the
only
people
who
would
be
in
a
position
to
know.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
they
raise
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no
i
believe
that
the
affidavits
put
in
conflict
exactly
what
the
government
contended
that
no
clues
and
leads,
and
that
enough
was
here,
even
if
it
were
only
on
the
information
and
a
belief,
it
was
enough
to
have
a
hearing.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
i
would
say
in
this
instance
where
we
have
to
rely
on
government
witnesses,
government
employees
and
agents
then
we
should
have
a
live
hearing
where
we
could
either
examine
or
cross
examine
them
–
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
--
because
we
couldn't
get
affidavits
from
people
at
the
time,
who
were
then
working
with
the
internal
revenue
department
or
from
the
government.
it's
practical
impossibility,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
we
were
denied
that
right
because
it
was
impossible
and
impractical
for
any
defendant
to
obtain
affidavits
from
government
employees
who
were
then
working
for
the
government
or
from
the
government
prosecutor.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
got
only
in
this
case,
a
little
over
a
week
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
so,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
have
not
found
that
he
said
those
words.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
or
in
substance
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
it
starts
if
the
court
please,
at
page
67
of
the
record.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
i
think
after
a
six-week
trial
and
coming
up
and
making
this
one
of
the
points
of
appeal
that
the
case
in
all
fairness
if
we
are
right
in
this
point
should
be
with
–
the
judgment
of
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
i
cannot
say
that
that's
unfair,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
done
that
in
similar
instances.
for
instance
in
the
nardone
case
after
it
had
been
litigated
as
far
as
this
court
and
these
men
here
under
the
handicap
of
a
terrific
jail
sentence
at
that
time
to
have
a
hearing
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
i
wouldn't
say
that,
i
wouldn't
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
could
not
be
solution,
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
most
equitable
one.
i
think
the
judgments
of
conviction
should
be
reversed
and
the
prosecutor
has
done
these
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
don't
think
that
in
itself
mr.
chief
justice
would
be
enough.
i
think
at
such
a
hearing
if
this
court
decided
to
do
so
we
should
also
be
entitled
to
examine
the
government
agents,
internal
revenue
agents
who
handled
this
particular
investigation
as
to
whether
or
not
they
got
clues
after
all
they
could
bring
before
the
grand
jury
certain
vendors
and
the
vendors
would
know
whether
or
not
they
had
been
brought
there
because
of
this,
what
we
allege
the
tainted
evidence.
only
the
agents
would
know
that
and
also
the
prosecutor,
particularly
mr.
leone
who
handled
the
52
and
53
indictments.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
be
inequitable
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
it
would
be
one
solution.
that
is
right.
now
the
government
now
contends
or
concedes
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
to
tainted
evidence
used
at
the
trial,
but
denies
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
any
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
tainted
evidence
had
been
used
before
the
1950
grand,
'53
grand
jury
and
the
government
contends
and
argues
that
mr.
stryker
had
made
no
motion
to
for
a
hearing
as
to
the
clues
and
leads
which
were
used
in
the
tainted
evidence
which
was
used
at
the
trial.
now
the
fact
is
that
mr.
stryker
had
made
this
pretrial
motion
which
was
denied
where
he
got
no
hearing,
and
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial,
mr.
stryker
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge,
judge
walsh
that
there
was
this
question
of
clues
and
leads
from
tainted
evidence
and
the
court
--
trial
judge
and
that's
on
page
245
pointed
out
that
it
understood
that
was
its
problem.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
all
throughout
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
right
your
honor.
however,
during
the
trial
and
it
took
place
at
several
times,
mr.
stryker
attempted
to
cross
examine
key
witnesses
as
to
this
issue,
key
witnesses
being
mr.
roth
who
was
the
defendant's
accountant
and
mr.
present
who
was
the
government's
internal
revenue
accountant
and
judge
walsh
precluded
any
examination
or
cross
examination
as
to
clues
and
leads.
judge
walsh
did
allow
mr.
stryker
to
ask
certain
of
the
vendors
about
clues
and
leads,
but
they
were
in
no
position
to
say
where
the
clues
and
leads
had
come
from.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no,
your
honor
it
was
also
pertaining
just
to
the
admission
--
for
instance
at
page
1353,
and
in
fact
if
i
may
in
our
reply
brief
we
point
out
at
page
2
and
3
specific
instances
where
mr.
stryker
was
precluded
from
cross
examining
as
to
clues
and
leads
and
obtain
--
and
the
exclusion
of
evidence
obtained
during
the
trial
or
used
during
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
that's
a
statement
made
by
a
prosecutor
and
probably
made
in
high
good
faith.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
however,
we
were
precluded
from
questioning
these
agents
at
any
time
during
the
trial
or
before
as
to
whether
or
not
they
did
use
clues
and
leads
at
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
i
think
the
united
states
district
judge
would
rely
on
such
an
assurance
but
the
defendants
had
no
protection
and
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
these
agents
actually
lived
up
to
that
assurance
given
by
the
assistant.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
i
couldn't
say
that
because
we
weren't
given
the
opportunity
to
prove
do
it,
to
prove
themselves.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that's
the
last
your
honor,
because
we
were
not
given
an
opportunity
either
before
trial
or
after
trial
to
establish
that
such
evidence
was
tainted.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
this,
the
costello
case
i
don't
think
applies
to
this
situation
and
these
are
about
two
first
points
and
neither
does
the
whole
case
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
oh
i
agree
with
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
without
question
and
we
allege,
if
the
court
please,
that
that's
exactly
what
we
did
here.
now
if
the
court
please,
there
are
other
points
argued
and
urged
in
our
brief,
which
only
because
of
limitation
of
time
and
not
because
of
their
importance
i
leave
to
the
brief.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
that
i
would
--
if
i
may
then
i'd
like
that
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
if
the
court
please,
we
were
not
permitted
to
cross
examine
key
witnesses
and
we
were
not
permitted
to
put
on
the
witness
stand
questions
of
the
prosecutor
who
had
presented
the
1952
and
1953
indictments
to
the
grand
jury.
and
i
would
like
to
just
read
certain
parts
from
the
record
concerning
that.
in
the
record
page
1353
the
prosecutor
characterized
the
problem
as
one
relating
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
and
called
upon
defendants
to
establish
a
further
foundation
and
requested
it
be
done
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
stryker
pointed
out
the
only
way
defendant
could
establish
were
the
leads
and
clues
outstanding,
that's
on
page
1354,
from
the
illegal
seizure
is
through
the
witness
as
they
are
presented.
and
the
prosecutor
stated
that
he
did
not
object
at
all
to
counsel
inquiring
of
mr.
roth,
a
key
witness,
about
the
documents
that
he
saw.
the
court
then
stated
i
don't
want
to
get
into
their
question
of
documents
even
though
you
might
have
no
objection
to
it,
that's
at
page
1354.
later
on
at
page
1356,
the
trial
judge
in
most
certain
terms
refused
to
permit
defendant's
counsel
to
interrogate
a
government
witness,
roth
again,
concerning
the
prosecutor's
use
of
tainted
evidence
at
the
trial.
at
page
1944
when
there
was
an
attempt
to
cross
examine
another
key
witness
of
the
government
mr.
present,
the
government's
accountant,
the
prosecutor
objected
the
statement.
it
presents
a
preliminary
question
as
the
admissibility
of
evidence
as
to
the
suppression
of
these
leads
and
clues.
and
at
page
1950
--
1945,
the
trial
judge
stated
that
judge
palmieri
said
there
wasn't
enough
foundation
to
start
laying
them
or
at
least
to
take
the
time
of
this
court
to
progress
any
further
with
it.
i
am
not
going
in
to
subject
on
the
basis
of
what
we
have
had
so
far.
again
at
page
1958,
the
trial
court
stated
you
wanted
to
have
a
hearing
at
this
time
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
before
i
take
that
time,
i
would
like
to
know
what
foundation
there
is
for
it.
further
at
page,
record
page
2077,
the
defendant's
counsel
in
his
motion
to
dismiss,
at
the
close
of
the
government
case,
maintained
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
interrogate
all
of
the
government
witnesses
concerning
the
evidence
used
before
the
grand
jury,
and
the
following
colloquy
took
place.
this
is
page
2077,
if
the
court
please;
the
court,
what
i
am
interested
in
now
is
there
anything
in
this
trial
before
this
jury
that
has
been
improperly
obtained.
mr.
stryker;
the
point
was
really
that
we
were
not
able
to
find
out
whether
those
things
were
improperly
obtained
or
not.
as
the
record
stands
it
is
not
clear
but
we
were
not
allowed,
not
permitted
to
inquire
into
the
facts.
the
court,
this
is
at
page
2078
of
the
record,
what
he
said
was,
that
there
was
no
adequate
foundation
before
him
for
such
a
hearing.
now
if
an
additional
foundation
developed
before
me
why
then
i
would
reconsider
it.
further
on
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
mr.
justice,
judge
palmieri
held
true
that
there
was
no
foundation
and
he
said
particularly
in
view
of
the
government's
affidavits,
that
there
was
no
foundation
laid
to
contradict
those
affidavits,
because
they
could
only
be
contradicted
on
information
and
belief,
but
judge
palmieri's
main
ruling
was
on
this
question
of
submission
of
the
ex
parte
affidavit.
and
all
throughout
the
trial
judge
walsh
insisted
on
unless
we
produce
more
evidence
to
lay
a
further
foundation,
we
were
precluded
from
going
into
this
question,
but
he
wouldn't
allow
us
to
cross
examine
which
is
the
only
way
i
know
which
would
–
that
is
cross
examine
key
witness.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
he
was
given
the
right
by
judge
walsh
to
question
certain
of
these
vendors
who
were
not
in
a
position
to
know
where
the
clues
and
leads
came
from.
however
when
he
asked
mr.
roth,
an
accountant,
a
certified
public
accountant
concerning
this,
he
was
precluded
when
he
asked
the
government
accountant
mr.
present
was
cross
examined,
he
was
precluded
when
he
put
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
exactly.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
there
wasn't
enough
foundation
laid
for
him
to
enquire,
additional
foundation
that's
exactly
what
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
that
is
right
your
honor,
no
question
about
that.
and
furthermore
when
he
--
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
in
our
reply
brief
–
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
yes
it
does.
at
page
2087,
mr.
stryker
pointed
out,
86
i
am
sorry,
to
the
court,
your
honor
will
permit
me
i
am
sure
to
(inaudible)
in
those
moving
papers
and
cross
examine
them
with
respect
to
this
issue.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
no
i
can't
say
that
there
was.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
well
the
subject
matter
was
indicated
insofar
as
clues
and
leads
obtained
from
the
documents,
these
partnership
documents,
which
had
been
obtained
from
us
and
from
the
grand
jury
testimony,
which
had
been
obtained.
now
before
and
i
don't
think
mr.
fisher
made
the
--
meant
to
answer
the
question
that
all
of
the
grand
jury
testimonies
before
the
grand
jury
in
1952
was
submitted
to
the
defendants.
it
was
just
their
own
testimony,
transcripts
of
their
own
testimony
which
was
returned
to
the
defendants,
not
all
of
the
testimony
which
he
said.
mr.
joseph
leary
delaney
thank
you.
