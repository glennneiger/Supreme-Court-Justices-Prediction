mr.
milton
pollack
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors.
this
is
an
act
--
conspiracy
case
which
was
tried
in
the
second
circuit
in
1955.
the
trial
commenced
on
january
the
10th
1955
and
was
concluded
in
march.
mr.
lloyd
p.
stryker
was
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
trial.
mr.
milton
pollack
all
of
them.
mr.
stryker
died
during
the
year
1955
and
i
was
consulted
and
retained
in
this
matter
in
january
1956,
some
four
weeks
before
the
case
was
to
be
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
an
appeal
that
already
been
taken
by
giglio
and
livorsi
in
case
number
10.
that
appeal
was
held
suspended
until
judge
walsh
sentenced
mr.
lawn
eight
months
after
the
trial
in
december
of
1935.
then
he
took
an
appeal
and
there
had
been
a
stipulation
to
join
the
two
appeals.
the
failure
of
the
lower
courts
to
follow
the
doctrines
announced
by
this
court
some
30
years
ago
in
berger
against
the
united
states
is
the
principal
matter
on
this
field.
as
your
honors
are
fully
aware
conspiracy
cases
involve
defendants
at
the
center
of
the
conspiracy
and
sometimes
seek
the
latch
on
a
fringe
defendant
because
of
some
association
which
is
charged
against
this
fringe
defendant.
lawn
is
a
fringe
defendant.
his
conviction
must
have
been
as
much
a
surprise
to
the
government
as
it
was
to
the
petitioner.
his
acts
and
i
have
been
at
pains
to
go
through
some
3000
pages
of
record
and
to
supply
this
court
with
a
detailed
schedule
of
each
and
every
page
reference
in
this
entire
record
where
the
name
lawn
is
mentioned
regardless
of
a
character
mentioned.
and
i
have
set
forth
at
page
80
to
my
principal
brief
in
a
schedule
form
on
one
page,
every
single
reference
that
is
made
to
mr.
lawn
in
this
entire
3000-page
record
--
mr.
milton
pollack
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
milton
pollack
this
is
the
main
brief,
the
first
brief
that
i
submitted,
it's
an
80-page
brief.
mr.
milton
pollack
80,
the
last
page
of
the
entire
brief.
mr.
milton
pollack
no,
no
on
this
dispute,
mr.
milton
pollack
the
brief
is
dated
--
mr.
milton
pollack
oh
you
probably
saw,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
milton
pollack
yes
your
honor.
we
contend
in
this
court
that
lawn
had
no
prima
facie
connection
whatever
with
any
conspiracy
and
that
in
addition
to
that
there
was
an
egregious
trespass
on
lawn's
rights
both
by
the
manner
of
this
prosecution
and
by
the
fact
that
his
motion
was
not
granted
to
dismiss
him
from
the
case
and
i
will
develop
those
points.
lawn
was
accused
here
of
aiding
his
principals,
two
principals
to
evade
their
tax
obligations
by
non-payment
of
their
tax
debts
and
to
orient
the
charge
against
lawn
let
me
say,
mr.
lawn
is
not
here
as
a
taxpayer.
he
didn't
aid
or
counsel
the
taxpayers
on
their
reports.
he
didn't
file
any
reports
for
them.
he
was
an
employee
in
an
enterprise
that
sought
to
develop
sugar
out
of
waste
material,
almost
like
developing
gold
out
of
sea
water,
but
they
thought
that
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
accomplish
this.
and
he
was
engaged
to
head
up
the
import
export
trade
and
the
research
and
development
of
that
project
and
enormous
sums
went
into
that
project.
lawn
was
trained
as
a
lawyer
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
at
the
outset
of
the
augment
to
spike
any
notion
that
lawn
appeared
in
this
prosecution
in
the
slightest
degree
at
any
page
of
each
and
every
one
of
these
references,
that
i
make
in
the
record
that
lawn
appeared
in
any
professional
capacity
in
any
transaction
or
action.
he
did
not
in
any
time
function
at
any
matter
as
a
lawyer.
his
co-defendants
were
advised
by
top
notch
attorneys
in
their
fields
and
tax
experts
even
for
the
simplest
transaction
and
because
the
government
has
made
some
point
of
this
in
my
reply
brief,
your
honors
will
find
at
page
22
the
list
of
the
activities
involving
lawyers
and
the
identification,
and
name,
and
record
reference
of
every
lawyer
who
had
anything
whatever
to
do
on
a
legal
level
with
this
man.
the
government
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
counts
against
lawn
and
there
are
three
out
of
the
ten,
two
--
counts
seven
and
nine
under
conspiracy
count
are
positive
on
the
premise
that
the
tax
returns
of
lawn's
principals,
the
tax
returns
of
lawn's
principals
not
his
tax
returns
because
they
are
not
involved
here,
were
proper
and
properly
filed,
but
that
non
payment
of
taxes
was
the
basis
of
the
crime
which
lawn
allegedly
aided.
lawn
had
no
personal
stake
or
interest
in
whether
or
not
these
people
paid
their
taxes.
he
had
no
obligation
to
see
that
they
did
pay
their
taxes.
he
had
no
personal
advantage
accruing
to
him
if
they
didn't
or
if
they
(inaudible)
payment
of
their
taxes
and
there
is
no
proof
whatsoever
and
i
confidently
state
that
and
stated
it
in
my
main
brief
and
requested
the
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
below
to
point
to
any
court
reference
in
the
record.
there
is
no
proof
whatsoever
that
lawn
knew
--
that
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
lawn
knew
that
there
was
a
tax
due
from
anyone
of
these
principals.
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
lawn
knew
that
the
tax
was
unpaid,
and
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
lawn
knew
that
there
was
an
intent
not
to
pay
it.
mr.
milton
pollack
the
substantive
offense
--
mr.
milton
pollack
the
substantive
offense
was
that
giglio
bought
himself,
this
is
count
seven,
giglio
bought
himself
a
home
down
in
new
jersey.
mr.
milton
pollack
he
didn't
pay.
the
government
said
that
they
didn't
--
they
fraudulently
concealed
the
means
of
payment.
mr.
milton
pollack
the
conspiracy.
mr.
milton
pollack
not
to
pay
their
taxes
--
mr.
milton
pollack
to
hide
their
assets.
mr.
milton
pollack
to
hide
their
assets.
yeah,
well
whether
i
raise
that
point
in
my
brief
and
i
am
not
going
to
detain
the
court
--
mr.
milton
pollack
right,
incriminating
presumptions
were
indulged
in
by
the
court
below
with
respect
to
lawn's
knowledge,
this
basic
knowledge
that
it
even
was
necessary
to
prove
that
he
has
and
the
incriminating
presumptions
were
that
mr.
lawn
who
was
a
phi
beta
kappa
graduate
of
a
harvard
law
college
and
graduate
of
harvard
law
school
was
a
very
smart
man
and
he
should
have
known
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
know
what
was
going
on
as
judge
clark
says
below
in
the
transactions
that
were
proliferating
around
him
but
there
was
no
proof,
not
a
scintilla
of
or
proof
that
lawn
was
anything
more
than
a
smart
man,
legally
astute
and
stands
by
with
indifference,
because
he
had
no
obligation
whatever
with
the
respect
for
the
taxes
of
these
other
people.
the
case
against
lawn
in
short
was
either
non-existence
or
so
hopelessly
weak
that
the
pattern
of
the
prosecution
becomes
a
vital
consideration
on
this
appeal.
may
i
turn
to
that.
from
the
inception
the
prosecution
was
an
indefensible,
violation
of
the
petitioner's
rights
to
a
fair
trial.
this
is
of
a
special
impact
against
a
man
in
lawn's
position
of
the
fringe
defendant
because
he
was
on
the
outer
most
fringe
of
any
supposed
conspiracy
for
the
others
not
to
pay
their
taxes.
the
case
itself
got
off
to
a
bad
start.
judge
goddard
dismissed
the
indictment,
the
first
indictment
in
1952
because
of
the
misconduct
of
the
prosecutors
and
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
these
people
had
been
served
with
informations
in
1950
and
in
1952
when
they
were
punitive
defendants
to
felony
charges
on
the
same
matters,
they
were
held
before
a
grand
jury
and
under
subpoena
that
was
extracted
from
them
their
personal
and
partnership
record,
and
judge
goddard
on
motion
dismissed
the
indictment,
outlawed
the
evidence,
suppressed
it
and
ordered
it
to
be
returned,
and
as
your
honors
will
find
out
key
evidence
that
got
itself
into
the
trial
in
this
case
was
not
returned.
after
the
1950
indictment,
1952
indictments
were
dismissed,
the
government
proceeded
to
obtain
a
sealed
indictment
which
for
a
practical
purposes
parallels
the
1952
indictment
and
they
kept
that
sealed
while
they
were
taking
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit,
and
they
also
kept
the
records
that
had
been
ordered
to
be
returned
as
a
stay
order,
but
they
had
those
records
while
that
grand
jury
was
operating
in
1953
to
indict
these
people
on
the
same
counts.
and
then
when
their
appeal
was
dismissed
because
it
wasn't
timely
taken,
the
government
hadn't
perfected
its
appeal
timely
and
the
decision
became
final.
the
indictment
was
open,
but
the
records
were
still
not
returned
in
1954
on
an
application
to
another
district
judge,
judge
palmieri,
then
seeking
to
go
into
the
question
as
to
whether
any
of
this
illegal
outlawed
evidence
had
been
used
in
the
1953
grand
jury
proceedings,
which
failed
because
judge
palmieri
did
not
permit
them
to
go
into
what
had
been
used,
open
up
--
to
create
that
1953
indictment.
judge
palmieri
nevertheless
said
they
are
entitled
to
their
record
back,
i
order
you
to
return
their
personal
records,
and
yet
we
know
in
this
case,
through
what
the
solicitor
now
says
was
an
inadvertent
mistake
of
the
prosecutor.
that
one
of
the
key
papers,
a
$15,000
check
which
was
the
only
conceivable
link
that
the
government
had
to
link
lawn
to
crime,
and
was
spelled
out
its
thesis
for
the
purposes
of
the
jury,
that
he
had
participated
in
fruits
and
therefore
must
have
been
part
of
a
conspiracy,
that
$15,000
check
was
not
returned.
judge
palmieri
refused
to
permit
an
investigation
into
the
1953
grand
jury
proceedings
because
he
had
received
vouchers
in
the
form
of
affidavits,
seven
of
them,
from
the
prosecutors
saying,
we
didn't
use
any
tainted
evidence,
we
promise
not
to
use
any
tainted
evidence
and
the
tainted
evidence
won't
be
used
on
the
trial
and
judge
palmieri
said
in
the
face
of
those
representations,
i
leave
it
to
the
trial
and
if
there
is
any
use
on
the
trial
that
you
can
take
that
up
with
the
trial
judge.
on
the
trial
itself
--
mr.
milton
pollack
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
pollack
no,
i
think
your
honor
will
find,
the
motion
to
suppress
the
use
of
all
illegally
obtained
materials,
i'm
reading
from
the
record
183,
first
volume,
(inaudible)
there
from
must
also
be
denied.
defendants
can
only
complain
if
this
material
is
used
against
them.
united
states
attorney
has
sworn
that
this
material
will
not
be
used
in
the
future
and
this
oath
is
sufficient.
that
was
precisely
bottomed
on
that
proposition.
now
on
the
trial
itself,
mr.
stryker
made
recount
of
hands,
about
six
of
them,
to
obtain
a
hearing
on
the
use
of
outlawed
evidence,
because
he
was
satisfied
from
the
parallelism
of
this
case
that
they
had
to
have
used
these
80
cartons
of
personal
records
somewhere
as
to
get
that
1953
indictment.
but
judge
walsh
refused
any
such
enquiry
and
i
think
it
becomes
important
to
see
from
all
the
affidavits
and
i'll
detain
the
court
for
a
moment
to
point
to
one
of
these
affidavits
and
there
were
27
affidavits
supplied
in
all
in
this
prosecution
and
six
open
court
vouchers
of
like
kind,
and
i
draw
your
honor's
attention
to
record
2948,
that's
in
the
fourth
volume,
the
supplemental
appendix,
printed
with
a
brown
cover,
and
there
you'll
see
a
sample
of
these
vouchers
that
headed
off
inquiry
and
one
of
those
samples
mr.
white
--
mr.
milton
pollack
2948
your
honor.
mr.
milton
pollack
mr.
wessel,
the
prosecutor
says
this
affidavit
is
submitted
to
the
court
together
with
other
affidavits
attached
hereto
to
certify
the
record,
that
the
assurances
made
by
the
government
in
connection
with
the
use
of
certain
documents
have
been
fully
carried
out,
paragraph
two.
paragraph
five;
throughout
the
trial
of
this
case
i
carefully
analyzed
everything,
i
underscore
everything,
item
of
evidence
used
by
the
government
and
i'm
certain
that
none,
none
he
said
of
the
described
material
was
used
in
any
way.
none
of
the
questioned
evidence
was
used
as
direct
evidence
and
cross
examination
to
refresh
a
witness'
recollection
in
preparation
for
or
during
the
trial
as
a
lead
to
evidence,
or
in
any
other
manner.
and
if
your
honors
so
desire,
i
can
supply
you
the
page
references
to
27
such
affidavits
filed
and
six
express
statements,
one
coming
as
late
as
a
time
when
just
before
thee
people
were
sentenced,
in
a
burst
of
propriety,
the
prosecutor
again
at
one
--
on
page
2083,
i
would
like
to
state
again
if
your
honor
please
positively,
finally,
affirmatively,
i
will
do
it
under
oath
any
way
that
i
possibly
can
that
i
am
positive
that
there
has
been
nothing
in
this
case
from
the
trial
before
the
grand
jury
that
in
any
way
comes
from
those
categories.
these
lowing
reassurances
of
course
must
have
had
some
kind
of
an
impact
of
the
court
and
they
certainly
do
on
mr.
stryker,
but
they
turned
out
as
the
solicitor
now
says
to
be
an
inadvertent
mistake
with
the
piece
of
evidence.
the
inadvertence
was
about
the
one
thing
that
affected
lawn,
because
when
he
appeared
before
that
grand
jury
that
judge
goddard
said
had
no
business
to
hold
him
before
the
grand
jury,
he
produced
four
pieces
of
paper,
one
of
them
was
this
check,
the
second
one
was
the
stub
end
piece
from
which
the
check
was
made
and
then
two
other
checks,
but
this
one
check
was
drawn
to
howard
lawn
and
endorsed
by
howard
lawn
and
show
that
howard
lawn
had
gotten
$15,000
on
november
7,
1945.
he
didn't
take
the
stand
to
testify
to
what
their
transaction
was,
but
the
prosecutors
used
that
very
effectively
by
showing
this
was
--
he
must
have
been
doing
something
as
your
honors
will
see
he
said,
what
did
he
get
the
money
for?
it
wasn't
his
salary
which
he
was
getting
separately
(inaudible).
lawn
was
the
forgotten
man
during
this
trial
as
attested
by
the
schedule
to
my
brief
and
the
sporadic
references
in
the
case.
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
summation,
the
prosecutor
was
visibly
touched
by
mr.
stryker's
demonstration
of
the
hole
in
the
government's
case,
and
the
unreliability
of
the
tales
of
admitted
perjurers
and
criminals
who
testified
for
the
government
and
he
was
impelled
to
bolster
the
government
case
by
giving
his
unsworn
testimony
to
the
jury,
by
announcing
that
he
was
scarping
his
original
plan
of
summation.
he
was
touched
to
acquit
as
a
trial
lawyer
and
then
he
proceeded
for
testify
to
the
jury
by
the
means
of
the
summation
and
that
took
two
forms.
number
one,
he
vouched
for
the
truth
of
the
tale
of
roth
and
lubben
and
told
the
jury
that
they
were
telling
the
true,
and
number
two
he
induced
prejudice
against
the
petitioner
lawn
by
ascribing
a
host
of
collateral
crimes
or
misconduct,
not
material
and
not
shown
by
any
of
the
evidence,
but
it
was
his
witnesses
who
had
been
in
that
category
so
he
thought
it
was
desirable
to
accuse
mr.
lawn
likewise,
so
what
did
he
do?
this
was
a
tax,
aiding
a
tax
conspiracy,
so
lawn
found
himself
on
the
summation
at
the
end
of
a
seven
weeks
trials
without
any
evidence
in
the
record
or
material
for
the
trial
being
accused
on
summation
of
fixing,
bribery,
fraud,
personal
tax
evasion,
forgery;
and
yet
the
charge
here
was
that
these
tax
principals
hadn't
paid
their
taxes.
not
satisfied
that
he
had
done
well
enough,
he
told
the
jury
that
if
they
couldn't
swallow
the
tales
of
roth
and
lubben
these
two
key
witnesses
on
whom
the
government
depended
for
a
convictions
here,
they
told
the
jury,
but
don't
forget
you
can't
deny
the
$15,000
check.
no
matter
what
you
think
of
their
testimony
he
argued
the
summation,
you
can't
deny
the
(inaudible)
evidence
and
here
is
the
$15,000
check,
but
that
was
outlawed
proof,
and
that
found
at
record
2604
in
the
summation.
mr.
milton
pollack
i
am
trying
to
say
to
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
government
is
conceding
on
this
proposition.
they
have
conceded
that
gone
this
far,
they
said
it
was
an
inadvertent
mistake
of
the
prosecutor
to
use
this
evidence
because
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
affidavits
that
he
filed.
i
read
that
as
meaning
that
they
had
no
business
using
it,
because
if
it
wasn't
a
mistake,
then
i
don't
know
what
they're
talking
about
and
if
it
was
a
mistake,
they
had
no
business
using
it.
mr.
milton
pollack
that
did
not
indicate
your
honor
that
the
pay
back
had
come
from
the
tainted
1952
proceedings.
mr.
milton
pollack
because
papers
other
than
those
that
mr.
lawn
produced
were
produced
by
the
government
from
innocent
sources,
and
they
were
all
marked
with
the
grand
jury
mark,
but
there
was
one
telltale
mark
that
identifies
this
as
the
paper
that
lawn
produced
and
should
have
been
returned
to
him
by
the
order
of
suppression.
now
let
me
see
if
i
can
go
over
that
again.
the
government
had
a
whole
hoard
of
papers,
some
it
had
obtained
on
its
own,
other
papers
it
had
obtained
through
subpoena.
all
of
the
papers
were
marked
as
grand
jury
exhibits,
grj,
date
7/15/52,
exhibit
number
so
and
so,
but
only
one
of
the
papers,
two
of
the
papers
i
should
say
or
four
of
the
papers,
because
he
produced
four,
had
an
identification
on
it
that
proved
unarguably
within
the
confines
of
this
record,
that
this
was
the
check
and
this
was
the
stub
that
lawn
produced
on
july
15,
1952
that
judge
goddard
said
was
suppressed.
and
your
honors
will
be
interested
to
know
how
it
happened
that
i
develop
this,
and
if
i
may
indicate
to
you
why
i
happened
to
find
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you.
mr.
milton
pollack
the
government
apparently
--
the
government
didn't
know
a
thing
about
this
and
i
claim
to
be
the
first
discoverer
of
this
thing
at
the
time
that
i
had
entered
the
case.
mr.
milton
pollack
i
think
they
should
know
it,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
i
think
--
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
undisputed
your
honor.
mr.
milton
pollack
undisputed,
exactly
which
is
the
copy
that
was
introduced
before
the
‘52
grand
jury.
now
at
the
time
it
was
introduced
before
the
grand
jury,
they
gave
the
check
back
to
lawn,
the
original,
but
said
now
before
we
give
it
back
to
you
want
to
take
a
photostat,
so
they
photostatted
it.
and
they
have
a
process
down
there
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
that
when
they
photostatted
it,
they
stamp
photostatted
by
the
united
states
district
attorney's
office
july
15,
1952
and
it
was
that
telltale
stamp
that
i
discovered.
now
here
is
the
way
the
exhibit
came,
you
see
footside
and
backside
of
the
check
voucher,
but
if
you
--
and
put
together
with
staples
at
the
top,
but
if
you
look
inside
the
original,
and
this
is
a
copy,
because
i
didn't
want
to
disturb
the
original
when
it
first
came
down
here,
if
you
look
inside
you
will
find
a
nice
pink
stamp
on
both
sides
of
these
presumably
hollow
sides,
presumably
sides
that
were
blank.
now
the
paper
had
all
of
the
other
elements
necessary,
they
said
grand
jury
exhibit
4,
7/15/52
and
it
had
file
exhibit
number
61b
or
a
as
the
case
maybe
for
the
check,
but
only
one
piece
of
paper,
the
one
that
came
from
that
grand
jury's
extraction
under
subpoena
had
the
stamp
on
it,
photostatted
by
the
district
attorney's
office
july
15,
1952.
mr.
stryker
tried
to
launch
an
inquiry
at
various
times
during
the
trial,
into
the
use
of
tainted
evidence
on
the
trial.
he
was
frustrated.
i
have
a
record
of
each
of
those
places
if
the
court
is
interested.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
use
of
exhibit
61
a
and
b,
that's
the
check
and
the
check
stub
was
harmless
evidence.
mr.
milton
pollack
at
the
time
that
the
check
was
introduced,
the
check
was
first
brought
by
the
--
i
assume
your
honor
means
the
trial
court.
mr.
milton
pollack
the
check
was
brought
into
court
and
marked
for
identification
by
the
prosecutor,
and
there
was
a
witness
on
the
stand,
roth,
and
they
asked
roth,
could
mr.
stryker
examine
this
man
preliminarily
with
respect
to
the
handwriting
on
this
thing
and
mr.
stryker
then
asked
five
or
six
or
seven
questions
with
respect
to
the
handwriting
on
the
paper,
and
then
he
said
no
objection,
and
it
was
marked
in
evidence,
but
he
was
objecting
on
the
ground
of
handwriting
because
under
cogen
against
the
united
states
he
had
already
objected
and
made
unavailable
for
all
purposes
in
this
prosecution
and
outlawed
forever
in
this
case
before
the
trial
as
this
court
says
it
must
be
done,
the
use
of
exhibit
61
a
and
b,
and
the
argument
is
made
that
mr.
stryker
was
a
very
experienced
lawyer
and
then
said
no
objection,
so
he
must
have
been
changing
his
mind
and
putting
it
in,
well
i'll
argue
that
issue
later
in
a
moment,
if
i
may.
mr.
milton
pollack
because
there
was
only
one
piece
of
paper
taken
from
mr.
lawn,
and
it
was
taken
from
him
for
photostatting
purposes.
the
piece
of
paper
taken
from
him
for
photostatting
purposes
was
the
check.
when
they
photostatted
it,
they
wanted
to
identify
when
and
how
they
had
gotten
that
copy.
so
the
photostatter
of
the
southern
district
court
stamped
it,
made
july
15,
1952
the
day
that
lawn
was
there
and
just
before
the
check
was
handed
back
to
him,
the
original.
that's
the
only
exhibit
in
evidence
that
has
that
stamp
because
no
other
document
was
taken
from
the
people,
which
was
photostatted
and
the
original
returned
to
them.
the
original
here
was
returned
and
the
only
way
you
could
link
it
was
to
show
that
was
the
thing
that
was
then
being
photostatted.
mr.
milton
pollack
right
sir.
but
it
was
the
pink
stamp
on
the
inside
of
the
folds
that
was
concealed
either
by
stapling
or
by
being
folded
over,
which
was
the
telltale
evidence
that
this
was
a
copy
that
had
been
obtained
in
the
manner
described.
there
is
going
to
be
some
talk
here
about
another
copy
that
they
obtained
at
some
other
time,
and
i'm
not
concerned
with
some
other
copy,
i'm
concerned
with
the
one
that
they
put
in
evidence,
and
all
i'm
concerned
with
proving
to
your
honors
is
that
the
piece
of
paper
that
went
into
evidence
was
the
piece
of
paper
that
the
grand
jury
got
from
lawn
on
july
15,
1952,
the
photostat
that
they
made
at
that
time
from
the
original
before
they
handed
back
the
original
under
the
process
of
the
subpoena.
mr.
milton
pollack
yeah,
but
the
grand
jury
--
that
didn't
taint
it,
that
didn't
necessarily
taint
it.
mr.
milton
pollack
because
they
could
have
conceivably,
as
a
matter
of
speculation
gotten
another
copy
somewhere
else
other
than
from
mr.
lawn,
it
was
a
paper
that
mr.
lawn
produced
there
that
were
outlawed.
mr.
milton
pollack
mr.
stryker
is
dead
and
i
have
got
to
go
by
what
i
find
in
the
record.
the
unconditional
statement
that
there
was
no
objection
was
not
a
waiver
of
the
constitutional
objection
because
the
constitutional
objection
had
been
made
and
granted
in
1952
when
it
was
outlawed.
mr.
stryker
at
the
time
was
--
in
the
context
in
which
this
was
going
on,
was
seeking
to
launch
an
inquiry
into
uses
of
illegal
evidence
on
the
trial,
and
in
the
course
of
one
of
those
inquiries
mr.
stryker
said,
“i
want
your
honor
to
give
me
a
chance
to
investigate
the
use
of
illegal
evidence
on
this
trial
and
before
the
grand
jury.”
and
mr.
stryker
said,
“i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
don't
overlook
any
constitutional
rights
that
are
involved.”
now
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
milton
pollack
the
court
below
said
that
the
constitutional
error
was
harmless,
that
there
had
been
a
waiver
and
that
there
was
no
harm
whatsoever.
mr.
milton
pollack
mr.
chief
justice
i
don't
know
which
statement
we're
talking
about.
mr.
milton
pollack
the
court
said
that
i
haven't
seen
any
evidence
and
i
have
been
watching
the
evidence
very
carefully
for
any
evidence,
anything
which
indicates
that
there
is
only
evidence
of
improper
evidence
coming
into
the
case.
the
court
refused
a
hearing
because
here
was
the
prosecutor
certifying
with
these
affidavits
on
all
statements
and
positive
assurances
and
the
court
was
saying
i
haven't
seen
any
evidence
of
it
and
mr.
stryker
was
saying
i
want
to
be
sure
that
nothing
unconstitutional
gets
in
here,
i'd
like
to
examine
this
thing,
sincerely
your
honors
i
think
that
he
would
try
and
say
i'd
like
form
an
inquiry
to
find
out
where
they
got
that
grand
jury
indictment
from
and
what
they
are
using
on
the
trial
and
mr.
stryker
said
the
point
was
really
that
we
weren't
able
to
find
out,
well
the
court
said,
is
there
anything
in
this
prosecution
and
mr.
stryker
said
i
can't
find
out,
he
can't
find
out.
mr.
milton
pollack
well
the
witnesses
--
mr.
milton
pollack
the
limitation
comes
about
as
a
matter
of
trial
experience
in
this
respect.
if
you
don't
have
people
who
know
what
went
on
in
the
grand
jury,
how
can
you
examine
them
on
cross
examinations
to
determine
that
they
are
papers
that
came
from
that
grand
jury.
mr.
milton
pollack
mr.
chief
justice
the
reaction
of
the
trial
court
started
out
at
the
opening
gong
and
january
10,
1955
where
the
statements
that
this
has
all
been
gone
into
by
judge
palmieri,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
for
us
to
get
into
this
thing,
later
on
as
time
went
on
he
said
i
haven't
seen
anything
from
across
my
desk,
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
these
sidelight
interesting
(inaudible)
mr.
milton
pollack
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
pollack
judge
palmieri.
mr.
milton
pollack
no,
no.
mr.
milton
pollack
in
the
trial.
mr.
milton
pollack
in
the
trial.
mr.
milton
pollack
the
latter.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
right
sir.
mr.
milton
pollack
no.
mr.
milton
pollack
on
september
7th
--
mr.
milton
pollack
you
see
they
were
seeking
to
dismiss
the
1953
indictment.
of
course
they
said
that,
that
parallel
indictment
couldn't
have
been
attained
except
by
the
use
of
illicit
evidence.
mr.
milton
pollack
no.
the
judge
in
that
case
as
i
read
to
mr.
justice
harlan
said
i'm
accepting
the
vouchers
of
a
prosecutor
that
they
haven't
used
any
such
stuff
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
they
would
--
mr.
milton
pollack
yes
your
honor.
mr.
milton
pollack
walsh.
mr.
milton
pollack
walsh.
mr.
milton
pollack
on
the
opening
day
of
the
trial.
mr.
milton
pollack
yes
your
honor
and
then
he
independently
later
on
said
in
the
course
of
the
trial
one,
two,
three,
four
or
fives
times,
i'd
like
to
get
into
this
question
and
get
this
inquiry
going
and
he
wasn't
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
milton
pollack
no
the
gravamen
of
my
objection
is
that
they
used
illicit
proof
on
the
trial.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
right.
mr.
milton
pollack
judge
palmieri
didn't
let
him
do
it.
now
i'd
like
to
turn
to
this
--
mr.
milton
pollack
no,
no
appeal.
i'm
not
sure
they
can
appeal
in
that,
but
there
was
no
appeal
in
any
event.
now,
here
we
have
this
situation
developing
on
the
trial
and
when
we
get
down
to
the
summation
of
this
hopelessly
weak
case
against
lawn,
where
the
adversaries
were
described
by
the
prosecutor,
that
lubben
was
a
perjurer
and
black
marketeer
and
practically
anything
else
you
want
to
talk
about,
he
admitted
many
other
crimes
and
roth
the
other
government
witness.
i
think
i
brought
out
15
or
20
of
his
crimes.
he
is
under
indictment
now
for
a
lot,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
ten.
i
believe
he
has
admitted
about
ten
more,
he
can
go
to
jail
for
200
years.
lawn
by
the
way
as
far
as
the
record
showed
by
a
government
witness
was
--
i
mean
he
was
regarded
as
a
very
good
character,
an
excellent
lawyer
and
his
capacity
as
an
associate
was
(inaudible).
he
was
raised
in
long
branch
and
had
a
good
reputation
as
a
young
lawyer
and
citizen.
he
was
the
former
chief
of
the
criminal
division
of
the
united
states
attorneys'
office
in
new
jersey.
and
seeing
his
case
going
out
the
window,
under
the
impact
of
mr.
stryker's
summation,
this
prosecutor
stepped
into
the
breach
with
the
following.
he
said
i
vouch
for
lubben.
the
government
put
lubben
on
the
stand
because
they
thought
lubben
could
be
vouched
for.
i
vouch
for
roth
also,
i
vouch
for
them,
and
i
will
explain
precisely
why
i
do
in
just
a
moment,
but
i
vouch
for
them.
when
i
say
i,
i
am
referring
to
the
district
attorney's
office,
and
i
merely
represent
them.
we
vouch
for
them
because
we
think
they
are
telling
the
truth.
and
then
again
lubben,
about
lubben
he
says
i
think
he
told
the
truth.
he
was
standing
before
that
jury
and
guaranteeing
the
guilt
of
this
defendant
and
he
didn't
have
a
chance
from
that
point
on.
here
was
this
man
representing
the
great
united
states
saying
to
this
jury,
i
have
knowledge
on
the
basis
of
which
you
can
rely
on
me,
none
of
the
things
in
evidence,
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it.
as
a
proper
prosecutor,
these
people
are
telling
the
truth,
and
then
as
though
a
little
fearful
that
he
had
overdone
the
thing
and
he
said
if
you
have
any
doubts
about
roth
and
lubben,
you
can't
deny
the
evidence,
here
is
the
check,
and
about
the
check
he
kept
on
saying
all
the
way
down
the
line
here
is
a
piece
of
paper,
here
is
a
check,
lawn
got
a
lot
of
money
out
of
this,
he
must
have
been
doing
something
to
get
it,
you
heard
about
his
15,000
legal
fee.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
the
outbound
check.
mr.
milton
pollack
right
sir.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
right.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
right
sir.
mr.
milton
pollack
yes,
but
there
was
--
mr.
milton
pollack
but
the
record
didn't
talk
about
it.
mr.
milton
pollack
within
the
record.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
right.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
a
sad
way
in
which
to
proceed
after
27
affidavits
and
six
open
court
vouches,
that
they
have
examined
everything
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
and
if
mr.
stryker
and
mr.
lawn
were
not
entitled
to
rely
on
those
vouchers
and
there
was
an
advertent
mistake,
then,
and
it
appears
plain
in
the
record,
i
don't
see
how
the
court
of
appeals
could
conceivably
have
said
that
there
was
any
way
over
that
constitutional
matter
once
it
has
been
established
by
judge
goddard.
mr.
milton
pollack
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
that
this
was
a
piece
of
paper
that
was
ruled
out.
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
from
the
contract
in
which
mr.
stryker
says
that
he
had
not
objection,
that
he
wasn't
giving
up
a
single
constitutional
right,
he
was
addressing
himself
to
a
subject
matter
that
the
court
allowed
him
to
examine
preliminarily,
the
handwriting.
there
isn't
any
question
whatever
and
the
solicitor
general
now
says
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
sorry,
they
call
it
inadvertent
mistake
of
the
prosecutor.
well
that's
enough,
that's
constitutional
error.
mr.
milton
pollack
that's
right
and
i
deny
that
they
had
an
untainted
copy
there.
mr.
milton
pollack
all
right.
mr.
milton
pollack
right.
now
mr.
stryker
didn't
make
an
objection
to
this
--
to
this
thing
which
i
said
to
the
circuit
court,
to
my
mind
offended
my
senses
of
ethics
as
to
how
a
prosecutor
should
sum
up
especially
against
a
fringe
defendant
about
vouching
for
him
and
calling
in
the
government
and
calling
in
the
whole
district
attorney's
office
and
calling
his
own
credibility
to
guarantee
this
man's
guilt
because
he
knew
these
crooks
were
telling
the
truth
against
him.
now
any
objection
by
mr.
stryker
to
that,
as
any
trial
knows
would
simply
accentuate
and
embed
the
point,
an
objection
would
have
been
useless.
if
trespass
had
occurred
and
the
error
was
obvious
and
there
was
no
correction
from
a
judge
who
proceeded,
that
really
helped
the
government
unwittingly
and
underscoring
the
point
by
refusing
to
charge
the
testimony
of
government
witness
is
not
to
be
any
--
dealt
with
on
any
federal
level
and
the
testimony
of
anybody
else,
that's
at
record
2762.
the
use
of
tainted
proof
has
poisoned
the
world
of
this
prosection
that's
full
of
mistakes.
a
recent
mistake
is
the
solicitor
general's
effort
here
to
bring
in
before
you
an
evidence
question
on
some
substitute,
which
i
am
not
going
to
talk
about,
i
hope
he
talks
about
and
explains
why
at
this
level
he
has
brought
before
this
court
matter
that
was
no
part
of
the
record
to
pull
that
there
was
a
pre-trial
waiver
with
respect
to
the
check.
confusion
and
not
proof
of
crime
explains
lawn's
conviction.
the
case
has
been
a
deplorable
prosecution
operating
by
mistakes.
i
leave
the
other
points
to
my
brief
and
if
i
have
two
or
three
minutes
left
in
my
time,
i
might
save
them
for
reply.
mr.
milton
pollack
i
have
endeavored
in
my
briefs
to
show
that
none
of
those
statements
can
be
documented
from
the
record
and
that
all
of
those
statements
go
outside
the
record
and
that
lawn
did
not
plan
and
lawn
did
not
do
the
thing
and
i
rest
lawn's
case
on
the
line
by
line,
word
by
word
analysis
of
judge
clark's
opinion
and
ask
the
government
to
document
if
they
can
do
it.
mr.
milton
pollack
yes,
your
honor.
