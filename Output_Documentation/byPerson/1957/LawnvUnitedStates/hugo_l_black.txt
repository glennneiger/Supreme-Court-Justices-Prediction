may
i
ask
you
before
you
do
that,
the
government
knows
whether
(inaudible)
you
mean
they
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
should
think
the
government
would
know
whether
this
case
which
we
are
talking
about
was
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
disputing

justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
challenge
here
is
based
on
the
premise
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
reversal
because
of
the
use
of
tainted
evidence
for
the
1953
grand
jury
or
because
of
that
you
were
not
permitted
to
show
that
the
evidence
at
the
trail
was
tainted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
we
have
no
question
here
on
the
basis
of
our
costello?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
guilty
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
you
say
if
there
was
any
tainted
evidence
(inaudible)
all
of
it
was
before
the
1952
grand
jury
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
1952
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
evidence
was
all
in
the
possession
of
the
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
deny
that
there
was
any
of
that
tainted
evidence
that
was
either
used
in
the
trial
or
from
which
clues
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
had
been
taken.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
concede,
i
understood
you
to
say
(inaudible),
is
it
your
idea
that
here
you
did
offer
any
of
that
tainted
evidence
or
used
evidence
that
was
obtained
as
the
fruit
of
the
tree
so
to
speak;
that,
that
would
be
sufficient
here
to
reverse
this
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
right
in
that
contention
that
they
were
denied
the
opportunity
and
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
see
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
would
suppose
if
you
reach
the
conclusion
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
a
disputed
fact
(inaudible)
you
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
were
denied
that
opportunity.
they
had
full
opportunity.
they
are
saying
if
they
were.
now
if
their
sole
question
here
is
one
of
facts
(inaudible)
i
understood
the
chief
justice's
question
was
that
you
refer
for
that
to
be
determined.
you
are
taking
the
position
now
that
there
is
no
dispute
of
facts
on
that
point.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
that?
why
not
a
new
trial?
if
that
is
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
let's
assume
that
they
have
been
denied
the
opportunity,
i
don't
quite
get
(inaudible),
assume
they've
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
show
that
this
was
the
proof
of
so
called
poisonous
tree,
and
they
had
been
convicted
in
a
trial
where
they
were
denied
that
opportunity
and
it's
your
idea
that
(inaudible)
without
giving
them
a
new
trial
if
that
error
is
in
the
record.
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

page
is

statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black

say
that
was
a
reply
to
something
in
the
opening
statement,
