during
the
month
of
july
of

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
at
that
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
wasn't
submitted
under
the
grand
jury
subpoena
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
had
produced
the
original,
the
four

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
he
appears
before
the
grand

justice
william
j.
brennan,

he

someone
got
before
the
grand

of

gave

nothing
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
don't
you
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
mean
by
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
conceding
it's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
identification
in
the
court
of
appeal
for
what
it
was,
the
attributes
of
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
don't
follow
that.
nothing
that
had
been
before
the
1952
grand
jury
would
subsequently
be
used
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
petitioner
had
asked,
it's
quite
clear
in
the
record
that
the
$15000
check
used
ageist
lawn,
and
the
check
also
used
as
evidence
against
him
were
not
to
be
used
in
anyway
was
evidenced
from
this
petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
obviously
what
i
am
getting
at
is
if
we
don't
agree
with
the
government's
position
in
the
lawn
case
as
it
does
with
$15000
check,
we
were
conclusive
in
the
lawn
case
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
i
gather
is
at
least
i
believe
so
played
any
part
at
all
it
was
so
minor
as
it
happened
to
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
second
circuit
i
know
that
this
is
also
a
point
made
here
that
the
summation
of
the
prosecutor
had
effective
preparedness
over
the
prior
(inaudible)
but
apparently
the
excerpts
from
the
summation
upon
which
this
point
is
supported
are
not
the
same
excerpts
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
would
you
mind
commenting
before
you
sit
down
apart
from
the
lawn
case,
upon
the
propriety
of
the
prosecutor
vouching
for
the
veracity
of
the
key
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
completely
active?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

i
believe
i
have
it
in
the
lawn's
plea.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
it
does,
2593
--
2587,
2587
or
88.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
as
to
what
the
--
going
back
to
2587
a
moment.
he
says
so
correct
me
i
vouch
lubben.
the
government
put
lubben
on
the
stand
because
it
thought
that
lubben
could
be
vouched.
i
vouch
for
roth
also.
there
is
no
question
about
what
they
did
back
in
1946
and
then
picking
up
the
material
that
you
referred
to
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what's
the
import
of
‘i
vouch
for?'
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
then
at
least
part
of
your
answer
to
the
question
i
ask
is
that
there
was
provocation
and
it
was
justified
through
the
language
employed
by
the
prosecutor.
