justice
john
m.
harlan
you
are
asking
as
i
take
it
position
to
your
legal
points
to
review
this
submission
together.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
say
quite
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
he
didn't
find
enough
basis
to
warrant
an
investigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
doesn't
that
appear
right
on
the
face
of
the
check,
that
was
marked
as
grand
jury
exhibit
with
a
–
was
a
grand
jury
exhibit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
thing
that
i'm
not
clear
about
is
why
the
stamp
by
the
inside
of
the
check
told
the
defense
anymore
than
the
stamp
on
the
outside
of
the
check,
which
was
obvious
to
everybody.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
obviously
it
must
have
been
photostatted
because
the
photostat
showed
that,
and
it
also
showed
on
its
face
that
the
photostat
that
was
used
at
the
trial
was
introduced
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
obvious
and
the
fact
that
it
was
marked
grand
jury
exhibit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
harmless
error
because
the
government
had
another
copy
of
this
check
from
an
untainted
source
in
its
possession,
was
that
the
basis
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
not
the
basis
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
didn't
he
direct
returns
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
all
the
documents
that
had
been
subpoenaed
from
lawn
and
these
were
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it
was
not
the
check,
the
disputed
check
among
those
documents.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore
aren't
you
stuck
whether
the
decision
was
right
or
wrong
with
his
opinion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
1953
indictment
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
one
on
which
this
prosecution
was
based.
justice
john
m.
harlan
judge
walsh
was
very
alive
to
that
issue
all
during
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
read
the
excerpts
in
the
record
he
referred
to
it
continuously,
he
finally
ended
up
by
asking
mr.
stryker
at
the
end
of
the
trial
to
submit
a
memorandum
in
writing
pointing
out
any
evidence
that
he
thought
was
tainted
and
mr.
stryker
didn't
do
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
am
i
mistaken
in
thinking
that
the
record
indicates
where
judge
walsh
refused
to
allow
mr.
stryker
to
go
ahead.
mr.
stryker's
questions
were
directly
to
the
use
of
the
tainted
evidence
before
the
53
grand
jury
rather
then
use
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
the
point
is
in
the
case,
in
the
briefs
as
i
read
them
and
if
i
understood
mr.
delaney's
answer
to
justice
black
is
now
taken
out
of
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
this,
that
when
the
trial
opened
stryker
was
talking
about
the
opening
up
the
indictment
because
of
use
of
evidence
before
the
1953
grand
jury
and
also
his
right
to
cross
examine
the
statement
at
the
trial.
and
that
this
statement
which
you
have
been
talking
about
in
your
judgment
refers
to
the
grand
jury
and
judge
walsh's
attitude
as
to
what
he
would
have
done,
what
he
was
going
to
do
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned.
judge
–
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that
in
the
writing?
