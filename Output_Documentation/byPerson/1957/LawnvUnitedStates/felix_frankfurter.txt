justice
felix
frankfurter
which
one
of
these
briefs
mr.
pollack?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
one
of
your
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
august
20.
justice
felix
frankfurter
august
20,
the
filing
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
substantive
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
read
the
brief
so
just
bear
that
in
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
substantive,
i
mean
what
was
the
offense
to
which
he
was
a
fringe
defendant,
you
said
non
payment,
(inaudible)
they
didn't
pay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
conspiracy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
helping
people
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
not
pay,
does
--
the
tax
is
due
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
hide
their
assets.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
mr.
pollack
that
these
matters
which
mr.
stryker
was
dealing
in
the
colloquy
we
just
had
between
you
the
chief
justice,
according
to
which
mr.
stryker
wanted
to
establish
that
the
evidence
about
to
be
put
in
or
that
had
been
put
in
was
illicitly
obtained,
thusfar
am
i
right
in
saying
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
do
i
understand
that
those
matters
had
been
gone
into
before
the
trial
started,
before
judge
whoever
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is,
were
these
matters,
this
question
that
you
just
read
to
us
of
mr.
stryker
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
in
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
did
he
raise
these
questions
the
first
time
in
the
course
of
the
trial
or
did
he
re-raise
them,
having
raised
them
preliminarily
as
the
nardone
requires?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
latter.
so
that
he
may
the
attempt
to
run
down
the
tainted
character
of
this
testimony
in
a
separate
proceeding,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
he
allowed,
to
pursue
the
chief
justice's
question,
was
he
there
allowed
to
establish
his
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
could
be
there
that
the
--
if
that
was
the
first
time
he
raised
them
he
couldn't
have
been
shut
off
at
the
pretrial
proceeding,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
the
sequence
of
events.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
(inaudible)
establish
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
before
judge
palmieri?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
came
up
and
tried
before
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
walsh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
did
mr.
stryker
re-raise
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
shut
off
on
a
theory
that,
that
had
been
settled
before
judge
palmieri,
is
that
the
course
of
events?
justice
felix
frankfurter
gravamen
of
your
objection
that
he
was
shut
off
from
proving
it
before
judge
palmieri.
wasn't
judge
walsh
right
in
saying
this
has
been
gone
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
i
understand
that,
but
the
gravamen
was
the
mode
of
establishing
that
fact.
your
argument
is
not
judge
walsh
did
isn't
already
been
gone
into,
he
was
right
about
that,
on
the
very
purpose
of
the
proceeding
is
not
to
have
the
trial
stopped
or
interrupted,
while
your
objection
is
that
judge
palmieri
didn't
let
him
do
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
check
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
check
which
you
claim
is
tainted
and
should
been
excluded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
the
check
which
if
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
i
look
at,
the
court
of
appeals
--
as
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
says,
it's
error,
it's
harmless
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
a
check
on
which
the
prosecutor
relied
as
heavily
as
this,
a
conviction
becomes
harmless
error
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pollack,
there
are
nine
of
us
and
the
counsel
(inaudible),
there
are
nine
of
us,
but
i
just
like
to
speak
for
the
only
one
i
can.
i
should
like
you
to
and
also
mr.
fisher
to
bear
in
mind
(inaudible)
saying
this.
if
there
was
in
this
case
a
conviction
on
the
basis
of
a
check
which
should
not
have
been
--
which
was
improperly
admitted
and
which
was
one
of
main
case
in
the
argument
in
procuring
conviction
and
that
was
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
one
i'd
like
to
know
what
answer
there
is
to
that
error,
if
a
error
it
was,
that
the
government
could
have
introduced
a
very
piece
of
evidence
but
didn't
or
mr.
stryker
having
that
as
an
important
point
raised
it.
now
this
case
is
so
full
of
points
that
it
is
like
buck
shot
that
could
all
over
the
lot,
but
if
you
can
even
establish
that
at
least
one
member
of
the
court
(inaudible)
at
least
one
member
of
the
court
will
be
greatly
persuaded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
you
--
and
one
more
thing,
do
i
understand
correctly
because
i
well
may
not,
i
haven't
read
this
record,
whether
he
told
you
–
i
didn't
even
(inaudible)
except
very
rarely.
do
i
also
understand
that
the,
that
although
it
maybe
true,
that
the
government
had
a
copy
of
this
check
and
could
have
introduced
it,
in
fact
it
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
care
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
–
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wondered
if
you
could
use,
if
you
could
use
your
(inaudible)
whether
you
could
use
your
time
to
better
preface
than
to
comment
on
the
summary
that
judge
clark
made.
after
all
this
case
comes
here,
i
think
been
tried
and
the
conviction
sustained
before
a
judge
whom
i
one
have
a
great
respect
in
a
unanimous
court
of
appeals.
i
wonder
if
you
try
and
better
use
your
time
and
to
comment
on
judge
clark's
summary
in
his
opinion
on
page
29
of
his
opinion
and
your
petition
of
certiorari
as
for
lawn
although
he
did
partake,
one
by
one
of
his
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
done
that
in
your
main
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
incorporation
or
corporation
mr.
pollack
said
that
the
corporation
to
make
sugar
out
of
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
to
just
make
sugar
out
of
waste
product?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
suggested
it
but
do
i
incur
that
that
was
a
sham
front
or
a
difference
here
as
an
instrument
of
the
pay
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
a
bona
fide
incorporation
(inaudible)
of
validity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
am
going
outside
this
record,
but
not
--
mr.
david
lubben
is
he
a
government
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
he
is
now
--
in
another
case
before
the
government
in
which
he
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
is
just
a
fellow
whose
property
was
guaranteed
by
the
district
attorney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
not
called
upon
either
to
dispute
or
to
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
lawn
appear
before
judge
goddard
and
drawn
into
(inaudible)
before
judge
goddard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
the
document,
which
he
was
asked
to
produce,
did
the
document
–
let
me
change
that,
did
he
produce
this
check
and
the
stub
in
response
to
the
subpoena,
to
produce
before
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
the
proceeding
before
judge
goddard,
was
the
check
and
the
stub
among
the
documents
that
judge
goddard
considered
as
improperly
to
have
been
elicited?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
include
the
duties
–
the
compulsion
of
production
in
response
to
(inaudible),
was
that
before
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
compendiously
it
was
before
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
did
judge
goddard
compendiously
or
comprehensively
pass
on
the
fact
that
it
was
improper
to
issue
this
subpoena
to
lawn
and
asked
him
to
produce
the
things
which
he
did
produce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
question
because
unless
that
even
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is,
i
don't
care
at
this
moment
and
i
have
no
view
at
all,
if
judge
goddard
was
wrong
in
saying
that
he
had
no
business
to
call
for
documents
if
it
was
corporate
or
partner
or
an
unincorporated
association,
he
may
have
been
wrong,
i
just
want
to
know
the
external
fact.
did
judge
goddard
dismiss
this
indictment
because
a)
witnesses
were
summoned
who
were
in
fact
were
then
under
suspicion
or
suspected
defendants
and
b)
because
they
were
asked
to
produce
documents
which
in
his
opinion,
right
or
wrong,
the
government
had
no
business
to
call.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
–
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
--
and
i'm
not
sure,
i
think
it
was
(inaudible)
was
this
dismissal
of
the
indictment
by
judge
goddard
appealable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
if
you
did
appeal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
order
then
--
judge
goddard's
opinion
was
final
as
far
as
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
then
file
a
new
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
raise
--
did
you
on
the
appeal
of
this
conviction
before
the
court
of
appeals,
was
the
decision,
around
the
decision
by
judge
goddard
open
for
review
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
did
you
raise
the
correctness
of
the
rulings
that
he
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
were
not
protected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
do
you
think
--
suppose
you
are
not
bound
here
bound
here
by
the
waiver
(inaudible)
you
can
open
--
you
are
free
here
because
your
views
i
am
not
saying
you
are
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
for
a
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
affidavit
mean
that
us
attorney
swore
that
i
now
swear
that
we're
not
going
to
use
it,
but
i
changed
my
mind
at
the
trial?
is
that
what
affidavit
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
did
it
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
the
question
of
(inaudible).
i
should
think
to
say,
if
i
may
bring
this
to
your
attention,
it
seems
to
me
that
judge
palmieri
or
any
other
judge
could
say
well
now
since
the
us
attorney
says
i'm
not
going
to
use
this,
there
is
no
point
in
(inaudible)
at
the
trail.
to
allow
that
to
be
done
really
goes
on
the
face
of
you
thought
was
undesirable
in
the
nardone
case.
you
want
to
break
up
the
trial
by
something
that
a
cause
for
a
free
trail
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
in
this
proceeding
which
judge
palmieri
said,
if
the
us
attorney
in
his
affidavit
disavowed
the
use
of
evidence
which
he
subsequently
introduced
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
four
volumes
isn't
that
all
we've
got?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
know
what
mr.
stryker
knew
about
that,
do
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
how
can
he
--
that
shows
to
be
different
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
we
don't
know
whether
they
can
use
that
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
rests
on
the
assumption
(inaudible)
stick
to
the
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
now
–
here
is
mr.
stryker
–
was
mr.
stryker's
point
of
view
that
the
second
indictment
was
invulnerable
as
the
first
one
and
for
the
same
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
just
said
that
he
got
a
copy
of
the
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
a
matter
of
grace
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
testimony
of
a
technical
common
law
of
partnership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
has
never
yet
said
that
that
doctrine
of
corporation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
follow
it
rightfully
in
his
possession,
go
out
and
get
it,
had
its
implications
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
don't
want
to
take
your
time
but
i
am
not
at
all
clear
that
the
doctrine,
that
i
am
very
familiar
about
corporation
and
unincorporated
associations
and
trade
unions
applies
to
partnership
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
i
give
somebody
else
a
document
which
i
don't
have
to
give
him
but
i
give
it
to
him
and
he
is
asked
to
produce
it,
he
can
say
no,
it
may
incriminate
him,
i
should
think
that
is
very
plain
and
said
clearly
whether
it
doesn't
apply
the
partnership,
well
what
you
are
doing,
it
is
simulating
partnership
to
have
a
very
different
status
in
anglo
american
law
for
unincorporated
associations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
pursue
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
am
little
troubled?
i
don't
understand
why
the
judge
should
ask
whether
he
is
a
potential
defendant
or
under
investigation
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
which
being
in
secret
may
evidence
et
cetera,
when
in
fact
he
was
notoriously
then
already
a
defendant
in
another
proceeding.
i
just
don't
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
your
client
then
represented
by
a
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
defendant
himself
didn't
say
your
honor
i'm
now
under
indictment
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
should
think
the
habit
of
adverse
or
dangerous
testimony
for
a
fellow
who
is
already
under
indictment
or
subject
to
prosecution
by
way
of
information
is
too
patent
as
against
the
hazards
of
potential
investigation
before
a
grand
jury,
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
excluded,
how
is
a
lawyer
for
a
defendant
before
the
court
excluded,
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
he
was
excluded
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
is
an
open
proceeding
--
this
is
a
proceeding
in
an
open
court,
determine
whether
he
should
be
committed
for
contempt
and
he
is
not
allowed
to
have
a
lawyer,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time,
it's
all
very
puzzling
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
obtaining
the
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
was
subsequently
admitted,
that
in
securing
the
indictment
of
1952,
what
you
stigmatize
as
tainted
evidence
was
used?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
saying
is
what
you're
saying
that
in
fact
there
had
been
used
by
the
government
tainted
evidence
in
securing
the
1952
indictment
which
was
dismissed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
government
was
in
possession
of
1952,
in
1952
of
tainted
evidence
as
you
call
it.
now
is
there
any
evidence
or
admission
that
in
securing
the
1953
indictment
that
illicit
evidence
was
used?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
you're
contending
that
there
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
defendant's
rights
in
connection
with
what,
the
1952
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there's
a
gap
there
as
i
follow
you,
all
you've
told
us
thus
far,
all
i've
heard
is
that
tainted
evidence
was
used
for
the
1952
indictment.
now
does
it
automatically
follow
because
tainted
evidence
was
used
1952,
it
used
in
1953?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
any
claim
made
by
mr.
stryker
or
by
you
or
anybody,
that
enough
was
shown
to
call
for
this
proof
or
at
least
explanation
by
the
government
that
there
wasn't
any
use
in
1953?
have
i
put
my
question
clearly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
he
was
shut
off
from
showing
inferentially
or
by
direct
evidence
that
the
1953
indictment
was
properly
derived
from
the
excludible
testimony
of
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
depends
what
issues
the
affidavit
raised,
what
issues
did
they
raise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
the
affidavit
was
of
a
kind
that
foreclosed
the
need
for
a
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that,
did
mr.
stryker
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
record
shows
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
quickly
refer
me
to
the
affidavit
on
the
basis
of
which
judge
palmieri
thought
it
was
needless
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
delaney
(inaudible)
affidavit
of
mr.
wessel,
i
hope
i
am
not
going
back
on
facts
of
your
arguments
of
whether
you
--
but
i
notice
the
conclusion
of
mr.
wessel,
he
was
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
was
he,
i
mean
he
was
the
effective
assistance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
his
conclusion
on
page
44,
paragraph
44
and
82,
“i
have
instructed
the
investigating
agent
that
they
are
not
to
use
in
this
prosecution
any
evidence
which
was
obtained
in
any
way
from
the
defendant's
testimony
or
production
of
partnership
documents
under
subpoena
of
the
1952
grand
jury.”
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
that
as
i
hope
mr.
fisher
when
he
gets
out
on
his
feet,
he
could
comment
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
questioning
any
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
you
say,
in
the
first
place
you
say
the
defendant
may
quote
and
not
have
to
take
the
word
of
his
adversary,
for
to
him
he
is
an
adversary
and
not
really
an
officer
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
second
place
are
you
suggesting
that
in
fact
there
was,
i
don't
mean
unscrupulous
or
improper,
but
in
fact
there
was
a
deviation
from
this
assurance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
i
want
to
ask
one
more
question
that
is
to
this
paragraph
44.
while
i
appreciate
your
point
that
you
want
an
opportunity,
you
wanted
an
opportunity
to
probe
and
that
your
claims
are
entitled
to
it,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
basis
for
such
probe
can't
be
fanciful,
can't
be
fantastic
and
just
a
(inaudible)
of
hope
that
something
will
turn
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
show
some
kind
of
solidity,
call
it
what
you
will,
some
kind
of
substance
to
justifying
a
probe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
objection
on
that
court
merely
go
that
the
indictment
was
vitiated
or
that
they
used
something
in
the
actual
trial
which
derived
from
the
1952
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
suppose
any
point
was
made
of
the
first
half
of
justice
black's
question,
namely
that
the
indictment
was
baseless
because
--
under
costello
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
just
suppose
he
said
no
to
justice
black's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
is
in
invitation,
the
point
isn't
any
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
repeat
that,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
what
you
said,
you
mind
repeating
what
they
had
and
what
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
just
want
to
know
what
that
proves?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does
that
prove
that
something
which
they
had
--
gave
them
a
clue
to
something
which
they
didn't
have,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
before
you
move
on
(inaudible),
well
i
don't
want
to
stop
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
and
if
i
took
too
much
time
i'm
sure
the
chief
justice
will
not
penalize
you
for
it,
but
give
you
extra
time
and
(inaudible),
but
this
case
is
to
me
far
more
important
than
whether
even
the
most
guilty
people
go
to
jail,
namely
what
is
involved
for
me
in
the
case,
that
the
argument
and
your
arguments
included
have
made
clear,
is
the
integrity
of
the
prosecutorial
system
of
the
united
states.
and
i
feel
very
sensitive
about
it,
because
he
says
we
have
a
get
deal
of
our
team,
i
once
played
on
this
team
and
i'm
very
zealous
of
its
reputation.
now
let
me
call
your
attention
to
things
further
on
the
bottom
of
page
245?
if
you
turn
to
page
246,
judge
walsh
for
whom
i've
already
expressed
my
great
respect
says
that
this
is
a
different
position.
this
doesn't
go
to
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment.
in
other
words
he,
i
think
it
he
means
the
judge,
he
is
taking
about
the
supression
for
use
at
the
trial
and
in
any
subsequent
time
will
he
properly
obtain
material.
mr.
stryker,
well
the
supression
of
all
evidence,
i
think
you're
right
about
that.
then
go
on
the
next
case,
go
on
the
next
page,
on
top
of
the
page,
we
have
not
been
able
to
make
that
inquiry
the
judge
tried
to
make
bringing
it
again
on
--
bringing
it
on
in
a
timely
way
et
cetera,
all
of
that
problem
is
really
injected
not
to
any
(inaudible)
in
this
trial,
and
the
very
purpose
as
your
honor
knows
so
well,
that
these
various
motions
to
suppress
evidence
and
so
forth
is
to
prevent
confusion
at
the
trial.
so
that
he
isn't
restricting
himself
to
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment
and
judge
walsh
didn't
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
page
247,
248,
it
interests
me
greatly,
because
of
the
suggestion
i
made
to
mr.
delaney,
hasn't
the
judge
a
right
to
rely
on
the
affidavit
of
the
district
attorney,
that's
exactly
what
judge
walsh
says.
what
i
would
also
say,
i'm
going
to
deny
your
motion,
not
only
because
judge
palmieri
reached
that
conclusion,
and
apparently
after
considerable
stock
taking
reflection,
but
i
would
also
say
that
if
i
had
the
problem
put
before
me
de
novo,
and
if
this
united
states
attorney
swore
to
me,
that
this
testimony
had
not
been
presented
before
the
grand
jury,
i
would
take
that
affidavit
on
the
basis
of
my
experience
with
them,
since
i've
been
here.
now
it
seems
to
me
to
raise
a
very
serious
question,
whether
defendants
must
be
foreclosed
because
of
a
confidence
which
i
should
think
a
judge
rightly
should
have
in
the
us
attorney
and
assistant
us
attorney,
assurances
that
there
are
no
clues.
is
that
what
not
only
means
the
assistant
attorney
can
say
i
can
assure
you
i
didn't
have
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
goes
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
goes
to
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
top
of
page
246
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
doesn't
go
to
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment,
he's
talking
about
the
supression
for
use
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
they're
not
going
to
use
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
instructing
the
agents
of
a
government,
that
means
all
the
revenue
people
who
has
got
anything
to
do
with
it,
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
get
any
clue
from
that
prior
start.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
does
that
foreclose
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
say
i'd
like
to
ask
a
few
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
judge
walsh
foreclosed
them
for
the
reason
that
he
gave,
namely
i
have
such
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
mr.
wessel
that
i
don't
propose
to
have
his
statement
questioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
anyone
read
--
certainly
i
put
it
to
you,
one
cannot
read
mr.
stryker's
statement
without
drawing
that
from
the
clear
inference,
the
clear
meaning
that
he
means
to
cover
it
full.
and
you
yourself
say
if
you
are
pointing,
you
are
right
on
this,
i
have
no
need
to
tell
him,
as
ever
being
to
tell
him
that
you
are,
that
you
are
scrupulous
in
saying
what
you
are
saying,
i
know
that,
but
if
you
are
right
that
they
did
in
fact
have
opportunity
to
cross
examine
all
the
witnesses
they
possibly
could
have
called
then
i
don't
think
you
need
any
of
these
other
forums?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher,
when,
when
you
use
the
word
‘due
process'
you
don't
mean
to
use
it
in
the
constitutional
sense.
we
are
not
restricted
to
finding
out
whether
the
matter
of
--
fifth
amendment
they
had
due
process,
they
are
certain
proprieties
in
the
trial
of
a
case
which
ought
to
be
observed
particularly
by
the
government
which
maybe
this
side
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
point
is
the
one
that
i
have
tried
to
make
mr.
delaney
mr.
fisher
namely
as
i
get
the
significance
of
what
you
are
now
saying.
you
were
saying
that
merely
by
suggesting
that
the
government
might
have
had
a
clue
to
something
that's
an
improper
clue
or
rather
a
clue
from
improper
testimony
or
illiterate
testimony
isn't
enough
that
there
must
be
some
(inaudible),
some
segment
of
the
imagination
that
there
might
be
something
connection
and
that's
what
you
are
now
arguing,
aren't
you?
i
understand
that
point.
i'm
troubled
by
various
things
to
which
you
yourself
called
my
attention,
look
at
page
201,
2083--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stryker,
mr.
wessel
of
course
does
not
have
and
had
very
frankly
stated,
he
does
not
purport
to
have
personal
knowledge
so
on
and
then
again
mr.
judge
walsh
in
the
court
accepting
everything
the
judge
said,
judge
walsh
said,
he
does
say
that
what
judge
palmieri
ruled
is
the
law
of
the
case,
it
was
also
said
in
the
law,
even
if
it
weren't,
he
goes
on
to
say,
that
he
would
do
it
independently
but
i
cannot
rid
of
myself
of
the
fact
that
if
a
judge
thinks
he
is
greatly
controlled
by
what
other
fellow
judge
says
that
that
is
not
the
best
state
of
mind
for
determining
whether
an
inquiry
independently
should
be
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
weren't
allowed
to
have
a
hearing
before
the
trial
started.
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
the
judge
give
rather
elaborate
charge
to
in
the
end
that
the
question
of
credibility
of
the
witness
was
for
the
jury
and
they
weren't
paying
the
attention
to
anybody's
use
about
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
that?
what
do
you
say,
what
is
this
implied
by
that
colloquy
namely
judge
walsh
said
you
were
denied
a
hearing
on
your
motion
to
suppress
because
no
foundation
was
laid
in
this
sense
that
no
starting
point,
there
wasn't
any
seed
out
of
which
anything
could
grow
and
he
says
however
despite
that
fact
if
you
now
produce
something
which
would
lead
me
to
say
this
opens
up
an
appropriate
line
of
inquiry,
i'll
let
you
go
ahead,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
just
brings
me
to
the
question
that
i
like
you
to
deal
with
before
you
sit
down,
as
i
understood
mr.
fisher
he
said
that
he
had
to
disagree
with
your
statement.
it
was
his
submission
that
mr.
stryker
whatever
may
have
been
the
ruling
of
that
flaw,
in
fact
was
given
opportunity
to
cross
examine
every
witness
who
could
shed
light
on
the
use
either
of
evidence
or
clues
derived
from
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
precluded
you
mean
judge
walsh
because
you
can't
ask
him
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
he
–
what
was
–
did
he
given
a
reason,
why
you
can't
ask
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
saying
then
that
if
i
went
through
this
--
when
i
go
through
this
record
i
will
find
that
while
cross
examination
was
made
of
witnesses
about
their
testimony
and
(inaudible),
the
witnesses
in
whom
mr.
stryker
naturally
was
most
interested
namely
the
government
witnesses,
there
were
barriers
to
that,
is
that
what
you
say
the
record
will
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
brief
give
record
references
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
cases
where
you
were
shut
off
from
enquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
moving
papers
was
there
an
indication
either
by
class
or
by
name
of
the
kind
of
government
official
that
was
sought
to
be
called?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
the
subject
--
was
the
subject
matter
indicated
beyond
saying
i
want
to
find
out
whether
you
used
any
of
these
things.
