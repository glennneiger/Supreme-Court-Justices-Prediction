mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
state
at
the
outset
that
i
disagree
with
counsel's
summary
of
the
evidence
and
disagree
with
his
statement
as
to
holding
and
decisions
below.
i
regret
this
court
will
have
to
fit
into
the
record
and
decide
which
one
of
us
is
right
and
i
hope
to
show
that
on
some
points
at
least
the
government
stands
correct,
i
have
no
choice,
this
versus
the
overall
fact.
this
is
one
of
the
â€“
a
petitioner
with
together
with
the
two
petitioners
in
the
next
case
to
be
argued
convicted
in
a
common
trial
of
one
of
the
most
vicious
and
largest
criminal
tax
evasions
known
to
the
government.
there
was
the
--
they
were
engaged
in
black
market
sugar
operations
and
candy
and
corn
syrup.
during
the
one
year
which
we
are
here
concerned,
he
admitted
tax
liability,
belatedly
admitted
to
be
sure
with
over
a
half-a-million
dollars
against
that
some
$17000
and
put
to
the
total
amount
the
government
received.
the
conspiracy
involved
a
bold
scheme
setting
up
corporations
withdrawing
the
funds,
falsifying
the
record,
destroying
the
record,
threatening
the
lives
of
potential
witnesses
against
him,
running
the
corporation
through
dealership
where
mr.
lawn
was
sought
to
have
influence
in
new
jersey,
and
then
saying
there
were
no
funds
left
by
the
time
the
returns
were
sought.
as
per
mr.
lawn,
he
was
a
former
chief
to
criminal
division
in
united
states
attorney
office
in
new
jersey.
he
was
on
the
payroll
of
somewhere
between
a
$1000
and
$1500
a
month
with
his
office
next
to
that
of
mr.
giglio,
the
head
of
the
enterprise.
lawn
participated
in
the
critical
meeting
in
the
september
'46
when
giglio
stated
that
he
was
not
interested
in
making
a
lot
of
money
to
become
a
big
taxpayer.
they
can
do
something
quick
and
he
outlined
the
scheme
of
setting
up
the
corporation,
drawing
the
funds
off
by
false
entries
and
then
dissolving
the
corporation
without
paying
the
tax.
lawn
has
been
instrumental
as
the
direct
testimony
of
the
accountant
who
was
there
for
meeting
who
is
state
evidence
in
this
case,
testified
for
the
government
as
well
as
one
of
his
partners
i
might
say
who
testified
for
the
government,
lawn
was
instrumental
in
setting
up
the
corporations
and
then
we
get
around
to
the
times
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
his
name
did
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
you
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
not
by
account.
if
you
sit
in
a
meeting
where
you
clearly
announced
the
scheme
to
setup
corporations
for
the
purpose
of
evading
taxes,
you
then
are
instrumental
in
setting
up
the
corporation,
the
corporation
then
evade
taxes,
you
suggest
the
receiverships
in
new
jersey
which
the
testimony
said,
lawn
suggested
it,
prior
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
testimony
of,
i
believe
it
was
roth
testified
that
lawn
suggested
the
receiverships
in
new
jersey.
he
thought
it
will
be
better
to
have
in
new
jersey
where
he
came
from
than
it
would
be
to
have
it
in
new
york.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
we
did.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
--
the
testimony
by
the
accountant
that
he
was
instrumental
in
setting
up
a
group
of
corporations
following
that
meeting.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
sugar
out
of
waste
product,
there
were
groups
of
corporations,
the
leading
is
the
american
brands
corporation
one
of
the
corporate
whose
taxes
were
here
involved
as
being
evaded.
the
taxpayers
are
lawn,
giglio
and
the
american
brands
corporation
taxes
will
have
some
--
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
taxes
were
not
paid.
in
september
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
one
of
the
other
agar
international
i
believe
or
one
of
the
subsidiary
corporations
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
i
do
not
suggest.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
was
a
candy
company
of
validity
that
during
--
sugar
rationing
last
on
black
market
deal
as
well
as
their
normal
candy
business
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
he
was.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
there
is.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
will
come
to
that,
yes
it
was.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
scheme
of
evasion
was
primarily
through
keep
the
government
from
knowing
that
the
income
was
earned
until
the
access
had
been
decreed.
mr.
lawn
signed
in
september
'47
when
all
tax
returns
of
both
individuals
and
all
the
corporations
involved
were
late,
he
signed
a
request
for
extension
of
time
in
which
to
pay.
this
contrary
to
what
mr.
pollack
said
this
shows
that
he
knew
there
were
taxes
owing,
he
knew
they
had
not
been
paid.
i
say
that
the
extension
of
time
was
based
on
false
consolidation
of
the
corporation
which
one
could
surmise,
they
knew
they
were
not
going
to
be
paid.
during
the
same
week
in
which
all
these
tax
returns
were
filed,
all
of
them
late
in
september
1947,
lawn
suggested
or
participated,
to
be
more
precise,
in
a
meeting
at
which
the
question
of
mr.
giglio's
house
was
concerned.
lawn
suggested
that
it'd
be
agreed
that
if
the
house
were
sold
to
the
accountant
mr.
roth,
this
would
keep
the
government
from
getting
the
house.
the
closing
then
took
place
in
lawn's
office.
now
that
the
--
as
mr.
pollack
has
pointed
out
there
were
3,000
pages
of
transcript
in
this
case.
i
have
not
gotten
time
to
go
through
the
hundreds
of
references.
i
have
not
checked
his
list,
only
spot
checked
it,
and
spot
check
indicated
two
citations
that
were
not
included.
so
i
--
maybe
all,
they
know
the
all
the
time
--
they
were
not
important
ones,
i
have
not
checked
in
detail.
i
might
say
one
of
the
critical
ways
in
which
petitioner
finds
the
evidence
insufficient
against
him
is
this
statement
that
the
jury
could
not
have
considered
evidence
as
to
the
15th
of
september
1947.
and
in
his
brief,
i
must
to
turn
to
this
because
i
--
it's
fairly
important
and
i
believe
counsel
(inaudible).
on
page
67
of
main
brief
in
number
nine,
lawn
states
the
conspiracy
to
conceal
necessarily
ended
also
with
the
filing
of
the
tax
return
and
the
prosecutor
so
conceded.
i
ask
the
court
to
the
check
the
reference
at
page
2890
where
the
prosecutor
says
that
the
conspiracy
culminated
in
the
filing
of
the
tax
return,
that
it
reached
its
higher
point,
did
not
end.
the
next
page,
page
69,
turning
over
to
petitioner's
brief,
starting
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
to
be
connected
with
the
conspiracy,
any
such
alleged
concealment
through
the
new
jersey
receivership
would
have
to
antedate
september
12,
15,
1947
when
the
returns
were
filed,
the
judge
so
charged.
in
my
view
that
is
incorrect.
the
instruction
of
the
court
was
that
they
must
find
the
assets
were
concealed
when
the
tax
was
due.
that
is
there
must
have
been
a
tax
owing
at
the
time
they
were
concealed,
not
had
been
concealed
prior
to
the
time
the
tax
was
owing.
in
that
way
petitioner
has
eliminated
the
test
of
the
evidence
showing
that
he
arranged
for
the
--
in
that
roth
would
give
false
testimony
in
the
new
jersey
receivership
proceeding.
now
that's
briefly
some
of
the
evidences
petitioner
lawn,
he
is
a
fringe
defendant
in
the
sense
that
it
makes
the
half-a-million
dollar
or
so
that
the
other
two
defendants
did
and
fringe
also
he
was
not.
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
purse
clean
apparently.
and
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
it
was
he
who
suggested
that
new
file
eventually,
returns
showing,
disclosing
most
of
his
income
and
hope
to
avoid
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher

67.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
of
the
brief
in
number
nine,
it's
in
the
middle
--
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph
before
the
italics,
towards
the
left.
the
principal
issues
here
relate
to
this
checking
stub,
exhibit
61
a,
and
61
b,
and
the
second
question
is
whether
petitioner
was
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
to
prove
his
case
--
the
government
case
against
him
was
based
upon
tainted
evidence,
those
seem
to
be
the
major
contentions.
there's
a
preliminary
one
as
to
the
record
before
this
court.
and
i
just
touched
on
the
record
briefly,
in
the
trial
record
there
was
no
objection
taken.
of
course
the
entire
1952
proceeding
judge
goddard,
grand
jury
minutes
were
not
before
the
jury,
they
were
not
in
evidence.
at
the
court
of
appeals
the
proceedings
from
the
appeals
from
judge
goddard's
dismissal
of
indictment,
the
entire
record,
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
that
was
offered
at
the
court
of
appeals
as
part
of
this
record
to
be
joined,
and
that
was
in
first
page
one
of
the
record,
states
the
counsel
proposed
to
move
on
the
argument
that
this
appeal
the
appellants
will
move
the
court
to
consider
the
record
in
the
prior
case
as
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
it
might,
yes.
in
1945
the
tavern
fruit
juice
company,
a
partnership
consisting
of
giglio
and
livorsi
gave
petitioner
a
check
for
$15,000
and
they
made
an
entry
on
a
stub
in
their
books.
mr.
lawn
endorsed
the
check,
canceled
by
the
bank,
returned
to
tavern
fruit
juice
company
record
of
the
partnership
where
it
stayed
along
with
the
stub
as
part
of
the
partnership
record
from
1945
until
1952.
in
1950
criminal
information
were
filed
against
the
petitioner
and
others
alleging
misdemeanor
income
tax
evasion.
about
april
1952,
petitioner
went
to
giglio
and
obtained
this
check
and
this
stub
from
the
partnership
record,
petitioner
then
was
under
investigation.
in
may
1952,
and
here
i'm
outside
the
record,
there
is
a
file
in
our
brief
as
a
fact
and
it
is
not
disputed
as
a
fact
in
this
court
that
in
may
1952,
an
occurrence
took
place
in
new
jersey,
which
the
government
got
possession
of
another
--
of
a
photostatic
copy
of
this
check.
i
believe
the
counsel
will
not,
certainly
will
not
dispute
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'm
trying
to
state
the
facts
that
are
as
the
chief
justice
requested
your
honor
to
go
through
the
chronology.
in
july
1952
as
the
petitioner
lawn
received
a
subpoena
in
connection
with
three
other,
lubben
no
--
roth,
giglio
and
livorsi
to
produce
any
record
of
the
partnership
or
corporations,
there
were
listed
partnerships
and
corporations.
lawn
responded
to
that
subpoena,
produced
four
pieces
of
paper,
this
check,
this
stub
and
two
other
checks
not
here
involved.
he
asked
if
he
could
retain
this,
they
would
give
it
back
to
him,
they
(inaudible)
the
government,
at
the
time
made
copies
and
gave
him,
returned
the
documents
themselves
to
lawn.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
check.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
61,
is
exhibit
61
a
yes.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
stub
is
exhibit
61
b,
which
were
both
introduced
at
the
trial
below.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
undisputed.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
while
he
was
before
the
grand
jury,
he
came
into
the
grand
jury,
he
said,
i've
--
the
only
partnership
record
he
said,
and
it's
interesting,
the
only
partnership
records
i
have
are
these
four
items,
he
did
not
indicate
there
was
personal
records
in
any
possible
way.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
the
dismissal,
judge
goddard
dismissed
the
indictment,
there
were
six
indictments
brought,
judge
goddard
found
the
procedure
of
subpoenaing
defendants
who
were
named
on
information
and
possibly
involved
in
the
grand
jury
investigation,
requiring
him
to
produce
documents,
requiring
him
to
testify.
with
that
he
particularly
took
exception
of
the
fact
that
giglio
had
four
times
come
before
the
grand
jury
and
gone
back
to
the
judge
in
order
to
produce
more
records.
i
might
parenthetically
say
we
read
the
compulsion
as
solely
directed
towards
corporate
records
and
the
government
still
believes
that,
that
decision
of
judge
goddard
was
erroneous,
but
we
are
not
here
arguing
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
do
not
contend
to
be
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
there
was
a
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
your
honor
he
did.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
may
i
answer
that
question
this
way?
before
judge
goddard
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress,
there
was
no
motion
to
outlaw
records.
the
motion
was
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
judge
goddard
dismissed
the
indictment,
he
found
--
he
said
expression
of
a
judge,
in
the
record
the
opinion
is
printed,
the
part
i'm
referring
to
in
2871
of
the
record,
fourth
volume,
but
with
the
expression
of
a
judge,
to
dismiss
an
indictment,
when
you
think
some
things
were
bad
or
wrong.
he
said
he'd
dismiss
the
indictment,
he
found
the
procedure
of
compelling
persons
who
had
known
the
defendant
was
bad,
he
found
that
the
(inaudible)
of
the
documents
that
were
produced
by
mr.
giglio
by
forced
compulsion
were
wrong,
he
dismissed
the
indictment.
but
then
said
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
issue
of
subpoena
to
all
four
defendants
in
the
form
they
were
--
was
not
fractured
in
anyway.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
the
issue
was
a
procedure
followed,
whether
some
of
the
documents,
in
fact
it
was
are
some
of
these
documents
on
which
the
indictment
based
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
say
no,
because
the
oral
record,
the
four
items
he
produced
were
records
of
partnership
and
it
was
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
issue
was
not
before
the
court,
my
answer
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'd
ask
your
honor
to
read
his
opinion
and
study
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
scope
of
his
opinion
was
on
the
procedure
that
it
was
bad.
he
mentioned
the
fact
that
they
had
not
been
formally
advised
of
their
rights,
the
great
assessment
of
fact
that
mr.
lawn,
the
former
chief
of
the
criminal
division
of
the
us
attorneys'
office
had
been
told
that
had
a
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
but
thinking
of
as
a
group,
as
applied
to
lawn,
the
arguments
seemed
to
have
less
merit.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
may
i
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
did.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
did.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
therefore
we're
not
stuck
your
honor,
if
your
honor
pleases.
he
pointed
out
it
also
evident
that
such
evidence
is
obtained
in
violation
of
these
rights,
maybe
ordered
suppressed
and
returned.
and
then
he
goes
on
and
says
it
is
directed
that
the
government,
the
government
directed
to
return
to
the
respected
defendant
partnership
and
personal
papers
produced
by
them.
we
had
already
returned
to
mr.
lawn
the
four
documents
produced
by
him.
it
was
argued
at
this
time
that
the
order
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'm
on
that
right
now
your
honor.
at
this
time
it
was
argued
that
below
the
order
--
i'm
wrong
not
this
time,
if
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress,
no
motion,
anything;
nothing
was
returned
this
time,
in
point
of
fact
it
went
to
--
take
the
chronology
alone
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
said
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
then
asked
if
he
could
have
the
documents
returned
to
him.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
four
of
them,
and
he
said,
they
first
said,
well
you
could
give
a
photostat
if
you'd
like,
then
they
said
well
maybe
we
could
make
photostats
and
the
originals
now,
and
then
the
record
stops.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
documents
of
any
kind
was
returned
to
anybody
at
this
time.
the
next
stage
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
was
a
stay
while
the
case
was
on
appeal,
it
was
stayed
by
stipulation.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
thought
it
was.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
was
filed
too
late
the
second
circuit
held.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
under
the
problem
of
was
when
the
second
judgment
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
a
fresh
indictment
was
returned
in
1953.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
in
the
cases
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
we
indicated
--
we
thought
the
ruling
was
not
correct
and
they
argued
with
greater
extent
to
the
court
of
appeals
than
we
do
here,
that
the
government
is
not
bound
by
this.
they
argued
it
can't
be,
the
court
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
didn't
meet
that
issue,
didn't
have
to,
they
sustained
it
on
the
â€“
this
one
on
the
waiver
on
that
ground.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
believe
that
judge
goddard
did
not
have,
he
didn't
â€“
in
fact
let
me
say,
petitioner's
position
is
that
dismissing
the
indictment
with
no
motion
to
suppress,
no
order
to
suppress
and
nothing
else,
dismissing
the
indictment
in
order
to
return
a
document,
that
he
held
that
these
documents,
in
the
80
(inaudible)
of
the
documents
giglio
supplied,
the
four
pieces
of
paper
that
lawn
had
supplied,
each
one
of
those
had
a
personal
privilege
to
each
of
the
four
defendants,
and
we
say
that
no
such
issue
was
before
it
and
certainly
not
involved
in
that
case.
the
only
issue,
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress,
there
was
no
motion
to
return
these.
the
only
issues
argued
and
litigated
was
whether
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
for
a
reason.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
of
the
procedure,
correct.
now
in
1953
a
new
indictment
was
returned
by
a
different
grand
jury
before
which
another
petitioner
has
testified.
the
petitioner
then
moved
to
dismiss
this
indictment
on
the
ground
that
it
was
identical,
almost
identical
to
five
of
the
six
indictments
that
had
been
submitted
previously.
this
motion
was
denied.
now
at
this
time
they
moved
--
this
was
the
protective
motion
to
suppress,
which
they
think
protects
them
from
making
any
objections
later
on
in
the
trial
stage
and
i'd
like
to
turn
the
same
page
of
the
record
in
which
mr.
pollack
was
reading,
183
of
volume
one
of
the
record.
this
is
judge
palmieri's
decision
denying
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
denying
the
motion
to
suppress.
granting
a
defendant's
motion
to
suppress
at
this
time,
wouldn't
(inaudible),
down
the
last
paragraph
of
page
183,
would
necessitate
an
investigation
of
all
of
the
government's
evidence.
such
an
investigation
would
entail
a
great
deal
of
useless
effort,
because
much
of
this
material,
which
has
been
collected
since
1948
will
not
be
used
at
the
trial.
of
course
if
during
the
course
of
the
trial
defendants
have
reason
to
believe
that
illegally
obtained
material
is
being
or
maybe
used
against
them,
they
can
object
at
that
time
and
it
will
incumbent
upon
the
trial
judge
to
rule
on
their
objection.
this
was
the
decision
which
mr.
pollack
relies
on,
the
petitioner
here
relies
on,
making
it
unnecessary
to
object
to
trial
for
illegally
obtained
evidence
there,
because
they
had
made
their
object
before
judge
palmieri
their
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
point
i
make
now
your
honor
is
at
this
stage
of
this
proceedings,
this
does
not
meet
the
requirement
of
an
objection
of
an
advanced
trial,
which
waives
the
requirement
of
making
an
objection
during
the
trial.
you
can't
do
that.
the
judge
said
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
we
haven't
got
enough
to
go
into
this
question.
if
it
appears
at
any
time
that
something
is
coming
up,
make
an
objection
at
that
time.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct.
but
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
affidavit
meant
that
he
was
not
going
to
use
any
evidence
obtained
by
the
means
which
judge
goddard
found
unconstitutional.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
please
the
court.
the
government
is
investigating
this
census
of
criminal
tax
(inaudible)
for
a
number
of
years
since
1948.
1954
they
asked
if
they
--
for
an
order
suppressing
all
the
material
which
had
been
brought
by
subpoena
before
the
grand
jury
and
all
these
include
summons.
judge
palmieri
says
in
view
of
the
fact
the
government
has
said
they
don't
plan
to
use
this
stub,
they
have
given
us
an
affidavit,
they
are
not
going
to
use
this
material.
we
think
the
better
procedure,
in
view
of
the
large
volume
of
material
is
for
you
to
make
an
objection
at
the
trial
on
any
item
appears
(inaudible)
from
the
source
of
any
item
that
is
not
known
to
you,
pick
it
up
at
that
time.
now
i'll
come
to
that,
because
we
think
the
procedure
here
was
far
more
than
required
by
nardone,
that
they
were
given
every
opportunity
to
cross
examine
throughout
the
trial
and
they
were
given
further
opportunities
to
suggest
any
item
which
they
did
not
know
about
and
they
failed
to
come
forward.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
--
on
a
construction
of
the
affidavit
and
a
construction
of
what
mean
by
evidence;
i'll
go
into
that
now.
the
government
had
obtained
this
check,
this
is
an
explanation
(inaudible)
far
outside
the
record,
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
all
right,
on
the
record
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
now
by
the
record,
you
mean
the
record
as
documented
in
the
court
of
appeal,
but
not
as
documented
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right.
a
large
amount
of
that
was
not
before
the
trial
court
and
was
introduced
without
objection
by
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
the
case.
the
government
filed
affidavits
that
were
not
new
to
trial,
any
evidence
which
obtained
anyway
from
the
defendant's
testimony
of
production
partnership
documents
under
subpoena
in
the
1952
grand
jury.
back
at
the
trial
the
government
offered
in
evidence,
exhibit
61
a
and
61
b.
it
is
not
of
record,
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
these
were
copies
of
the
check
which
petitioner
offered
to
1952
grand
jury.
the
government
concedes
that
as
a
fact.
it's
true
they
are
a
copy,
we
have
no
doubt
it,
the
record
does
not
show
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
date
on
the
back,
there
were
number
of
documents
before
the
grand
jury
on
that
date.
we
made
copies
of
other
documents
which
were
not
before
the
grand
jury.
the
government's
entire
photostating
equipment
of
the
us
attorney's
office
in
new
york
could
have
anything
produced
on
that
day,
without
that
date
stamp
on
the
bank.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
could
have
been
--
if
it
could
have
gotten
other
copies
of
the
same
check
which
were
offered
by
government
witnesses
at
the
same
grand
jury
proceeding.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
photostat
or
like
photostat.
if
you
go
back
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
well
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
i
might
say
that
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we're
conceding
it's
not.
we're
saying
that
the
record
does
not
establish,
the
record
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
is
mr.
lawn
says
i
have
check
dated
in
november
7,
1945
to
meet
tavern
fruit
juice
company.
it
doesn't
say
the
amount
of
the
check,
doesn't
identify
which
check
was
numbered
which
in
the
exhibits.
off
the
record
we
concede
that
it's
the
check,
no
doubt
about
it,
but
on
the
record
to
start
checking
the
record,
we
think
the
same
rules
ought
to
apply
both
times,
which
are
undisputed
facts
outside
the
record.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
i
guess
not.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
is
because
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right
your
honor
and
i
might,
if
i
might
say
at
this
stage
that
the
outside
the
record
again,
petitioner
does
not
acquit
a
case
and
says
denied
that
we
had
another
check
in
the
government's
possession
prior
to
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
we
have
no
idea
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well
we
don't
know
whether
mr.
stryker
examined
it,
knew
it
was
the
check
that
should
be
obtained
before
the
grand
jury
and
then
decided
not
to
raise
any
objection
because
he
knew
the
government
(inaudible)
that
check.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
he
is
not.
petitioner's
grievance
here
depends
on
your
assumption,
mr.
stryker
did
not
know.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
petitioner
made
no
attempt
objection.
at
the
trial
when
it
was
offered
mr.
stryker
examined
the
check,
asked
ten
questions
about
it,
details
of
handwriting,
differences
of
handwriting
and
then
said
no
objection.
near
the
end
of
the
trial
judge
walsh
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
at
the
trial
by
that
time
stryker
had
cross
examined
a
number
of
witnesses
as
to
the
date
to
which
they
had
obtained
documents
to
determine
whether
it
could
have
been
leads
and
clues
for
1952
grand
jury.
he
had
repeatedly
tried
to
attack
the
1952
and
1953
indictment
and
was
repeatedly
stopped
from
attacking
the
indictment.
he
was
not
stopped.
he
was
not
stopped
from
any
cross
examination,
as
the
source
of
any
item
of
evidence
offered
at
the
trial.
now
near
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
before
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
depends
which
grand
jury
you're
taking
about.
no,
if
i
may
please,
the
tainted
evidence
of
the
1950
--
the
so
called
tainted
evidence,
the
1952
grand
jury
proceeding.
at
the
trial,
petitioner
had
in
their
hand,
the
original
document
they
had
presented,
lawn
(inaudible).
he
had
the
complete
testimony,
the
minutes
given
to
him
of
that
grand
jury.
he
knew
what
was
tainted.
he
couldn't
possibly
mistake
it.
he
had
one
hand
the
check,
the
original
check
for
$15,000.
then
along
comes
the
government
and
introduces
61
a,
which
was
a
photostatic
copy
of
that
check,
in
evidence.
now
(inaudible)
well
could
have
said
now
where
did
you
get
that
copy
of
the
check,
let's
look
at
it
does
it
come
from
this,
no,
in
other
cases
they
did.
now
when
roth
was
on
the
stand,
i'll
refer
to
one
example,
page
1322
of
the
record,
mr.
stryker
cross
examining
mr.
roth.
now
mr.
roth
is
it
a
fact
that
you
testified
before
the
grand
jury
in
july
or
august
of
1952,
and
skipping
down,
mr.
roth,
yes
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
did
you
tell
the
truth
before
the
grand
jury,
yes
sir
and
so
forth.
were
you
asked
(inaudible)
prior
to
your
testimony
and
were
you
asked
to
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
produce
any
and
all
books
and
records,
then
he
goes
on.
and
then
he
asked
on
page
1323,
this
was
to
show
that
he
was
allowed
to
cross
examine
as
to
whether
any
evidence
has
been
before
that
grand
jury.
stryker
says
did
you
produce
the
papers
that
you
were
asked
about
here
in
this
court,
and
that
you
said
you
found
in
some
envelope
as
i
recall.
answer,
at
that
time
i
did
not
produce
it
because
i
found
that
just
recently
on
account
of
moving
from
the
premise.
time
and
again
he
was
allowed
to
cross
examine.
we've
made
a
number
of
references
in
the
brief,
on
1657
another
one
asking
mr.
gartner,
would
you
good
enough
to
tell
the
government
when
you
got
the
--
tell
me
when
the
government
took
from
you
these
documents,
and
the
answer
over
on
the
next
page
is
1950,
may
17,
1950.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
was
--
i
believe
it's
before
this
was
introduced
certainly
they
were
placed
in
1354
taxes
and
there
are
other
examples
of
the
pre
â€“
at
the
hearing
before
the
trial
started,
he
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
before
the
same
judge,
before
judge
walsh.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
wished
to
have
the
indictment
dismissed
and
he
repeated
that,
had
the
indictment
dismissed
because
the
grand
jury
and
that
question
is
in
the
next
case.
it
was
the
grand
jury,
he
had
a
right
to
go
to
the
grand
jury.
petitioner
lawn
did
not
claim
the
right,
does
not
raise
the
question
here
of
the
right
of
attacking
the
indictment
in
this
case.
but
that
was
what
mr.
stryker
said,
he
was
not
trying
to
eliminate
a
particular
item
of
evidence.
at
no
point
in
the
trial
that
he
object
to
any
item
of
evidence
as
being
tainted,
as
possibly
being
tainted.
he
wanted
to
get
the
whole
indictment
dismissed.
and
that
was
the
trust
of
his
questioning
throughout
the
trial.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
discussion
to
this
issue
throughout
the
trial
that
judge
was
fully
aware
of
his
position.
and
the
judge
repeatedly
said
if
you
will
show
me
anything
you
don't
know
where
it
comes
from,
i'll
stop
the
trial.
we'll
have
a
hearing.
but
we
are
not
going
to
have
a
hearing
unless
you
can
tell
me
some
piece
of
evidence
you
want
to
be
questioned.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
â€“
yes
that
was
his
view
that
the
second
indictment
was
so
similar
to
the
first
and
it
should
be
dismissed
on
that
ground
or
at
least
he
should
be
allowed
to
see
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
determine
whether
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
â€˜52
grand
jury,
the
tainted,
so
called
tainted
--
he
was
not
given
and
has
not
there's
statement
given,
a
copy
of
the
1953
grand
jury
minutes.
mr.
lawn
does
not
claim
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
judge
goddard,
in
a
proceeding
before
judge
goddard.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
now
to
finish
up
our
chronology
and
see
if
we
can
go
for
argument
after
that,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
asked
the
counsel
to
go
through
the
record,
asked
the
defense
counsel
to
go
through
the
record,
give
them
the
memorandum,
taking
the
evidence
item
by
item
and
suggesting
any
item
of
evidence
that
could
have
come
from
the
grand
--
1952
grand
jury.
this
was
to
see
that
i
have
tried
to
keep
out
the
evidence
all
of
it's
careful
if
will
you
please
go
through
and
see
if
you
can
find
any
item
of
evidence
that
could
have
--
that
could
have
been
developed
from
1952
grand
jury.
and
he
was
lawn,
the
original
check
in
one
hand,
the
photostatic
copy
of
the
check
in
the
other
hand
and
now
says,
oh
i
didn't
see
the
date
of
photostats
were
made,
that
could
have
no
way
have
affected
his
doing,
this
might
have
been
a
copy
of
that
check.
it's
--
the
date
on
the
face
of
it,
the
grand
jury
marking
was
7/15/52,
the
photostat
couldn't
be
made
before
that.
the
date
was
right
here
underneath
the
photostat.
if
it
been
made
any
date
after
that
petitioner
would
still
object
to
it
having
come
from
the
document
he
produced,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
date
the
original
copy
had.
well
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
petitioner
first
raised
this
point.
court
of
appeals
decided
that
stryker
had
waived
--
the
defense
counsel
had
waived
any
objections
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
also
referred
to
the
government's
offer
to
show
they
had
other
copies
in
existence
prior
to
the
1952
grand
jury
proceeding.
now
we
believe,
and
on
this
record
there
are
four
grounds
with
a
three
ground
â€“
and
i
pick
right
on
the
record,
three
grounds
on
which
this
court
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
these
three
documents.
first
is
that
on
the
record
there
are
partnership
papers
of
a
partnership
of
which
lawn
was
not
a
member,
a
former
employee,
he
could
at
no
time
have
asserted
the
privilege
that
was
offered
to
him,
they
were
not
tainted
as
they
can
in
any
event,
any
possible
way,
these
records,
the
canceled
check
after
it's
cleared
to
going
back
to
partnership,
the
stub
(inaudible).
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
was
an
agreement
yes
(inaudible)
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
suggest
that
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
lawn
was
not
a
member
of
the
partnership.
there
were
not
--
my
suggestion
is
that
if
this
court
should
hold,
lawn
could
have
had
a
privilege
as
it
is,
you
will
be
saying
that
a
man
under
investigation
may
go
out
and
get
incriminating
papers
wherever
they
are
from
other
people's
business
records,
get
them
into
his
possession
and
claim
privilege.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
in
one
--
three
chances
on
that
he
went
out
to
get
his
trial
under
criminal
investigation
for
use
in
his
investigation.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
--
on
that
one
my
suggestion
is
that
a
million
dollar
a
year
income
business
with
sugar
and
corn
syrup
is
a
business,
and
that
business
record
of
all
incorporated
associations
and
the
allied.
the
second
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
neither,
neither
court
ruled
--
neither
judge
goddard
nor
judge
palmieri
ruled
these
documents
were
privileged.
the
res
judicata
did
not
hold,
as
i
discussed
before,
the
privilege
applies.
now
our
second
independent
ground
is
waiver
at
the
trial
when
mr.
stryker
examined
the
documents
for
(inaudible)
more
in
the
record,
asked
10
questions
about
the
details
of
the
handwriting
and
made
no
objection.
now
this
was
a
photostatic
copy
of
the
check,
these
documents,
the
check
and
stub,
passed
the
document
that
lawn
had
produced
before
the
1952
grand
jury.
this
check
as
mr.
pollack
has
said,
the
large
check,
the
only
large
check
involved
in
this
case
is
lawn.
now
certainly
his
counsel
and
petitioner
knew
what
was
involved.
it's
inconceivable
that
they
were
taken
by
the
surprise
or
didn't
realize
this
is
the
same
check
that
they
have
produced
in
the
court.
only
conceivable
thing
is
they
decided
not
to
make
any
objection
or
i
think
the
worst
which
i
would
not
suggest
some
other
lawyer
in
the
same
position
might
have
said,
let's
see
this
go
in
the
record
and
we'll
have
an
appeal
of
the
point
later
on.
we
believe
that
neither
party
to
dispose
that
covered
by
the
affidavit,
covered
by
the
order
before.
both
the
government
and
lawn
knew
this
check
had
been
delivered
to
the
government
before,
both
of
them
knew
the
government
had
copies
of
this
which
lawn
had
delivered
and
neither
party
ever
considered
this
photostat
(inaudible)
as
being
one
of
the
tainted
document
that's
what
got
in
a
wrong
briefcase
as
mr.
pollack
says.
i'd
say,
that's
the
implicit
fact
of
â€“
in
fact
both
prosecutor
making
these
affidavit,
introduces,
mr.
stryker
continually
to
objecting
to
any
possibility
of
tainted
evidence
wants
the
check
go
in,
the
important
check.
neither
of
them
ever
considered
that
to
have
been
covered
by
the
statement.
it's
only
after
new
counsel
hired,
retained
after
the
case
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
who
would
then
go
on
in
the
assumption
that
every
copy
of
this
check,
this
particular
photostatic
copy
was,
was
covered
by
the
order.
our
third
ground
is
that
did
not
find
the
memorandum
requested
by
the
trial
court,
specifically
memorandum
to
show
any
exhibit
that
could
have
come
from
the
tainted
document,
petitioner
waived
any
objection
which
were
necessarily
had
been
raised
by
that
memorandum.
he
could
not
have
complied
the
district
court's
requests,
repeated
requests,
three
or
four
times
the
district
court
said,
will
you
give
me
a
memorandum,
when
he
is
going
through
the
record
any
item
that
could
have
been
obtained,
defense
counsel
did
not.
now
they
could
not
have
gone
through
it.
they
have
check
in
one
hand
exhibit
61(a)
here
not
even
suggested
the
possibility,
that
this
exhibit
might
have
come
from
that
check
is
a
photostatic
copy,
they
had
one
in
one
hand,
and
one
in
the
other.
and
the
judge
asked
him
repeatedly
to
suggest
any
evidence
that
could
have
been
tainted,
any
compliance
with
that
request
could
have
produced
the
objection
or
given
us
the
opportunity
of
the
district
court
to
tell
this
document
did
not
privileged
and
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
mr.
delaney
has
outlined
clearly
the
two
principle
issues
before
this
court.
i
think
there
maybe
some
confusion
as
to
first
of
these.
first
is
the
alleged
denial
of
an
opportunity
to
establish
that
tainted
was
used
for
the
1953
grand
jury.
second,
is
an
alleged
denial,
the
opportunity
to
prove
(inaudible)
to
the
case
against
them
at
the
trial,
which
was
based
on
evidence
that
was
allegedly
obtained.
turning
to
the
first
question,
i
believe
mr.
justice
black's
question
on
that
is
the
government's
answer.
we
believe
that
they
were
accorded
in
the
first
instance
argument
and
affidavits
on
that
issue,
a
hearing
of
a
sort.
it
was
not
an
evidentiary
hearing
of
the
testimony.
we
believe
there
was
no
need
for
a
hearing
of
any
additional
time,
because
no
matter
what
that
hearing
had
shown,
indictment
valid
on
its
face,
of
a
properly
constituted
and
unbiased
grand
jury
would
not
be
subject
to
dismissal
by
the
fact
that
among
the
evidence
they
had
considered,
if
it
were
true,
was
evidence
which
had
been
obtained
from
the
defendants
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
i
may
i'll
keep
the
two
questions
distinct
because
they
were
kept
quite
distinct
in
judge
walsh's
mind
at
the
trial.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
is
such
an
argument
in
the
briefs
and
the
first
point
to
which
counsel
was
addressing
himself
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well
if
i
may
just
make
it
absolutely
clear,
there
is
no
question
in
our
minds
that
a
denial
of
an
opportunity
to
attack
the
indictment,
the
denial
of
due
process,
he
says
there
is
no
costello
point
in
this
case,
we'll
accept
that
statement,
but
since
the
brief
argued
the
point
i
want
it
clear.
the
holt
case,
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
justice
holmes
writing
the
opinion,
in
that
very
case
there
was
evidence
obtained
from
the
defendant
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
was
adjudicated
to
be
that
way
at
the
trial
court.
it
was
conceded
that
it
has
been
considered
by
the
grand
jury
and
the
court
unanimously
said
you
cannot
attack
the
indictment
on
that
basis.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well
if
that
was
the
case,
i
am
satisfied,
i
want
to
get
our
view
that
holt
and
costello
were
absolutely
controlling
on
that
point.
i
will
now
turn
to
the
principle
denial,
alleged
denial
of
due
process.
this
is
based
on
the
nardone
decision
(inaudible),
it's
applicable
to
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
government
does
not
dispute
that.
it
further
goes
on
the
theory
that
since
they
had
established
through
judge
carter's
decision
that
there
had
been
some
prior
violation
of
their
rights,
they
were
at
least
entitled
to
some
opportunity,
however
closely
confined
if
i
may
take
the
language
of
nardone
to
seek
to
prove
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
case
against
them
was
fruit
of
that
poisonous
tree.
our
answer
to
that
is
they
were
accorded
due
process,
full
due
process,
every
opportunity
that
could
have
been
given
to
them
within
reason
to
seek
to
establish
that
any
evidence
at
the
trial
was
the
fruit
of
the
1952
grand
jury
proceeding.
let
me
run
through
what
they
had.
first,
they
were
provided
with
all
of
the
allegedly
tainted
evidence
itself.
they
had
the
original
documents
produced
before
the
1952
grand
jury.
they
were
provided
the
transcript
of
their
testimony
before
that
grand
jury.
it
was
available
to
them
throughout
the
trial.
that
were
thus
--
and
everything
that
could
have
helped
them,
everything
that
government
could
provide
them
with
to
help,
inspect,
trial,
record
as
it
developed
and
compared
with
the
tainted
evidence.
the
1953
grand
jury
minutes
which
they
did
not
have
were
immaterial
in
this
regard.
they
were
neither
tainted
--
they
were
neither
the
tainted
evidence
nor
were
they
the
trial
evidence.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
had
every
exhibit
which
had
been
introduced
before
the
1952
grand
jury.
they
had
the
transcript
of
their
1952
grand
jury
testimony.
this
was
a
sum
total
of
the
allegedly
tainted
evidence
involved.
that
was
there
and
in
their
use
of
counsel
and
defense
at
the
trial.
secondly
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
had
the
tree
itself.
they
were
good
--
when
coming
to
the
question
of
whether
an
opportunity
to
discover
whether
any
of
the
evidence
was
fruit
of
that
tree,
they
had
the
complete
tree,
they
had
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
is
not
a
complete
answer.
it
is
something
--
certainly
it's
easier
to
find
out
whether
the
evidence
was
tainted
if
you
have
the
fruit
of
it,
you
have
the
complete
tainted
evidence.
secondly,
the
petitioners
and
here
i
disagree
with
mr.
delaney's
reading
of
the
record,
petitioners
were
accorded
every
opportunity
to
cross
examine
any
witness
to
find
out
where
the
documents
had
come
from,
how
this
document
had
first
been
produced,
where
this
figure
came
from,
every
opportunity
where
the
purpose
of
that
investigation
was
to
find
out
the
source
of
the
document
used
at
the
trial
and
what
was
not
effort
to
establish
an
attack
on
the
1953
indictment,
because
although
holt
and
costello
were
out
here,
they
were
the
principle
grounds
which
defense
counsel
mr.
stryker
was
urging
throughout
the
trial.
for
example
just
the
--
they
refer
to
the
facts
of
leads
and
clue,
the
thrust
of
their
attack
was
always
the
leads
and
clues
used
in
1953
indictment.
the
reference
is
given
in
the
reply
brief
(inaudible)
on
page
two,
they
refer
to
page
245
of
the
record,
to
talk
about
the
outset
judge
(inaudible)
as
to
leads
and
clues.
i
quote
the
phrase
leads
and
clues
from
page
245.
the
sentence
reads
because
it
leads
and
clues,
dropping
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
page,
were
obtained
from
the
illegally
evidence
which
lead
to
that,
which
lead
to
this
present
indictment,
that
would
render
the
indictment
unfounded.
we
submit
that
most
of
the
references
to
leads
and
clues,
and
most
of
the
attack
was
on
the
indictment.
now
as
to
cross
examination
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
with
regard
to
defendants,
petitioners
here
(inaudible).
there
was
no
contention
that
we
use
any
of
that
evidence
in
obtaining
their
conviction.
they
only
contend
that
they
were
denied
the
opportunity,
of
the
denial
of
due
process,
a
fair
opportunity
to
establish
that
we
may
have
used
leads
and
clues
or
that
some
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial
might
have
come.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
then
i
--
should
the
court
reach
that
conclusion
i
would
accept
the
chief
justice's
suggestion
they
are
now
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
see
whether
--
at
the
district
court
to
see
whether
any
such
evidence
was
in
fact
sued.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
as
to
these
two
defendants
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
are
two
stages
that
i
can
find
certain
about.
their
allegation
is
they
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
some
of
the
evidence,
substantial
portion
of
the
evidence
against
them
was
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
we
say
they
had
the
opportunity.
now
should
the
court
find
by
reading
the
record
that
judge
walsh
contrary
to
our
belief
of
the
record,
if
judge
walsh
denied
them
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
make
this
proof,
you
should
reach
that
conclusion.
it
does
not
mean
that
any
evidence
used
in
the
trial
was
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
it
merely
means
they
were
denied
the
opportunity.
they
should
be
allowed
under
that
circumstance
to
go
back
and
go
through
the
entire
record,
cross
examine
every
witness
they
see
fit.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
why
another
trial
if
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
because
they
were
accorded
some
opportunity,
they
were
--
whatever
--
your
honors
should
feel
it
was
sufficient
or
not,
they
were
allowed
to
cross
examine
every
witness
as
to
that
point.
they
were
asked
to
provide
any
indication
of
any
item
of
evidence
about
which
they
had
any
doubts
that
could
have
come,
of
course
they
did
not
know
the
source.
three
times
the
judge
asked
them,
they
declined
to
submit
the
memorandum.
they
were
accorded
some
opportunity.
if
this
court
should
feel
that
there
is
a
chance
the
record
is
tainted,
there
is
a
chance
that
their
conviction
is
based
on
tainted
evidence,
let
him
establish
that.
nut
suppose
they
had
a
hearing
down
there
and
they've
put
every
witness
on
and
the
facts
were
undisputed
after
that
hearing,
that
the
trial
record
was
absolutely
clean
as
a
whistle,
there
was
not
one
bit
of
tainted
evidence,
i
see
no
reason
why
these
defendants
who
had
been
convicted
after
six
weeks
trial
on
evidence
which
is
in
fact
untainted,
should
have
--
stand
another
trial.
that's
the
government
position
on
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
does,
this
brief
here
suggests
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
government,
to
show
that
each
bit
of
evidence
as
it
came
in
was
untainted.
there,
we
believe
the
burden
would
not
have
been
--
that
to
put
a
burden
on
the
government,
you
must
question
some
item
of
evidence,
even
if
that
is
not
so,
the
judge
here
as
a
finding
found
that
there
was
no
basis
for
suggesting
any
evidence
did
not
come
that
way.
we
meant
--
throughout
the
trial,
this
question
was
before
the
trial
court
as
mr.
justice
harlan
had
suggested,
everybody
was
conscious
of
this.
as
each
bit
of
evidence
was
introduced
the
government
witnesses
asked
now
when
did
you
get
that,
where
did
you
get
that,
1948,
1949,
i've
got
that
from
the
new
jersey
receivership.
we
got
that
from
such
and
such
doctor.
the
witnesses
own
records,
that
account
where
these
are
my
own
records,
(inaudible)
this
is
the
document
i
had
in
my
possession,
i
didn't
have
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury,
i
had
lost
it,
i
then
produced
it.
there
was
direct
testimony,
there
was
cross
examination
we
submit
as
to
every
bit
of
the
evidence
in
the
record.
we
met
any
burden.
the
judge
found
that
he
could
see
be
no
basis
for
questioning
any
item
of
evidence,
but
then
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
go
ahead.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
your
honor,
the
very
language
you
read
shows
the
motion
which
judge
walsh
would
answer,
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
the
(inaudible)
which
he
was
relying,
but
the
issue
which
we
believe
you
just
ruled
out
of
the
case.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
language
that
he
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
both
were
discussing,
now
if
i
--
i
say
that
the
language
in
which
he
says
i'm
relying
on
the
testimony,
the
affidavits
of
the
us
attorney,
as
to
what
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
your
honor
you
read
the
language
himself.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
at
the
top
of
page
246
there
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right
and
if
i
may
separate
the
two
questions,
as
to
what
took
place
at
the
trial.
judge
palmieri
denied
the
motion
to
suppress.
he
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
because
the
government
had
such
a
vast
amount
of
documents
dealing
with
this
case,
that's
acquired
for
four
years
before
the
1952
grand
jury,
that
he
ruled
and
so
voluminous
that
under
the
circumstances
and
in
his
discretion,
he
would
reserve
the
question
of
supression
to
--
and
in
light
of
the
government's
statement
they
are
not
planning
to
use
that
thing,
he
reserved
the
question
and
which
meant
to
him
that
at
least
they
were
not
going
to
use
most
of
the
tainted
evidence.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
were
not
going
to
use
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right
sir.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
do
not
believe
the
defendants
here
were
foreclosed
in
that
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
you
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
exactly.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
i
do
not
deny
that
throughout
on
occasion,
throughout
the
transcript
before
the
trial
and
references
which
you
referred
that
mr.
stryker
referred
to
the
problem
stressing
evidence
at
trial
and
said
back
to
the
judge
palmieri
had
denied
his
motion
to
suppress,
meant
that
he
had,
--
as
well
as
denying
his
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
meant
that
he
had
to
bring
his
questions
out
to
trial
and
at
one
point
that's
quite
clear.
now
at
the
end
of
the
trial
he
said,
i
think
i
have
been
denied
this
opportunity
for
trial
and
judge
walsh
said,
no
if
saw
any
basis
for
stopping
the
trial
now,
any
statement
of
law
for
your
raising
of
questions
in
the
document
i
would
in
spite
of
its
disruptive
effect
on
the
trial
i
would
give
you
the
hearing
of
(inaudible)
court.
let
me
give
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
2082
and
volume
3
of
the
record,
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
2081,
remarks
which
i
referred
is
in
2082.
mr.
stryker
reluctant
â€“
this
is
the
court
speaking,
reluctant
as
i
would
be
to
break
in
on
the
trial
i
would
do
so
if
i've
got
any
basis
for
investigation.
now
to
get
back
to
what
you're
talking
about,
you
find
in
the
middle
of
page
2081,
where
the
court
starts
off
just
above
the
middle
on
page
2081
of
the
record,
does
not
--
mr.
stryker
says
that
the
record
stands
there
is
no
proof,
these
documents
that
these
vendors
and
their
testimony
were
obtained
to
least
include
--
improperly
obtained
i
admit.
the
court;
it
is
not
just
that
mr.
stryker.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
suggests
to
you,
i
mean
i
don't
have
to
show
me
on
this
record
proof
that
anything
was
obtained
by
improper
leads
and
clues
but
what
is
there
here
which
even
suggests
or
lays
any
basis
for
a
hearing
on
investigation
into
that?
now
this
is
at
a
stage,
give
you
what
due
process
which
we
believe
these
petitioners
were
accorded,
i
read
to
you
yesterday
some
cross
examination
of
mr.
roth
where
he
was
cross
examined
by
the
court
--
by
mr.
stryker
as
to
whether
particular
documents
were
among
documents
he
had
produced
before
the
'52
grand
jury.
we
referred
in
our
brief
to
a
number
of
other
instances
where
the
government
witnesses
were
cross
examined
as
to
where
they
got
the
document.
the
major
case
here
on
the
whole
tax
thing
by
the
government
witness
mr.
present
who
took
all
the
figures
from
all
the
pieces
of
documents
that
were
before
the
government
worked
out
what
their
net
income
was
and
what
tax
they
should
have
paid.
mr.
present
was
subject
to
cross
examination.
mr.
stryker
could
perfectly
easily
have
gone
and
said
now
where,
what
is
this
figure
based
on,
where
did
that
come
from?
there
was
no
interruption
of
that
kind.
where
is
this,
where
did
you
get
this
thing,
he
was
in
fact
asked,
where
did
you--
when
did
you
get
those
documents?
1948.
what
documents
do
you
have
in
1949?
he
could
have
by
cross
examination
found
out,
and
if
the
present
had
said,
well
i
can't
tell
you
about
that
or
i
don't
know
about
that,
he
could
have
got
a
basis
from
which
you
could
raise
the
question
with
the
judge.
after
this
proceeding,
throughout
the
trial
they
are
claiming
denial
of
due
process.
they
cross
examined.
they
are
allowed
to
cross
examine
every
witness.
the
only
time
mr.
present
was
stopped
when
mr.
stryker
sought
to
bring
before
the
jury
document
which
had
before
the
52
grand
jury.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
accept
that
and
we
wouldn't
--
we
believe
that
case
accorded
petitioners
everything
they
could
have
asked
for
and
in
fact
everything
they
did
ask
for
except
to
stop
the
trial,
have
a
factual
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
without
judge,
what
evidence
or
what
questions
or
what
thing
they
want
to
go
after,
they
want
a
hearing.
the
judge
if
i
may
turn
on
to
1950,
record
1957
where
the
court
said,
talking
to
mr.
stryker
we
have
a
three
volume
record
now
and
i
ruled
on
this
on
my
recollection,
bottom
paragraph
page
1957.
i
don't
recall
anything
that
could
have
been
developed
from
improper
records
that
it
comes
before
the
jury
yes,
but
i
maybe
wrong
on
that
and
i
am
just
foolish
not
to
take
advantage
of
the
better
background
that
you
both
have
and
i'd
like
to
have
a
memorandum
on
that
from
you
which
will
tell
me
what
if
anything
you
think
the
foundation
is
for
a
hearing.
again,
he
referred
to
the
matter
on
2076.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
he
never
did
it.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
memorandum
was
ever
submitted.
a
suggestion
was
made
at
one
point
orally
that
the
six
vendors
who
testified
might
have
come
from
improper
clues.
to
show
how
closely
judge
walsh
was
following
the
matter
before
the
government
said
a
thing
judge
walsh
said
i
believe
the
government
obtained
those
from
the
accounts
receivable
of
the
tavern
fruit
juice
company
which
obtained
some
receivership
in
new
jersey.
he
now,
he
knew
where
the
leads
that
he
has
been
following
this
thing,
so
he
volunteered.
the
one
item
they
questioned,
six
vendors,
the
judge
volunteered
how
the
government
had
discovered
who
the
six
vendors
were.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor
in
considering
these
particular
phrases
which
you've
referred,
read
the
entire
colloquy
in
context.
start
with
2075
mr.
stryker;
first
your
honor,
i
am
moving
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
has
not
been
substantiated
by
the
evidence.
my
motion
also
includes
the
fact
that
we
have
not
been
permitted
to
trial
the
seventh
through
leads
and
clues
as
the
indictment
or
through
leads
and
clues.
and
then
he
went
on
and
the
court,
i
know
your
general
view
mr.
stryker
i
want
to
know
what
is
there
in
this
case,
207
thing,
you
say
it
was
improperly
obtained
then,
what
exhibit,
what
testimony.
and
our
response
to
your
honor's
question
is
that
on
the
basis
of
what
they
had
shown
namely
1952
grand
jury
proceeding
and
the
similarity
of
indictment
that
was
not
enough
to
stop
the
trial
and
hold
a
side
hearing,
but
there
was
enough
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
believe
that,
i'll
take
you
on
that,
but
there
was
not
enough
to
hold
a
separate
factual
hearing
that
the
ruling
of
judge
palmieri
not
to
suppress
--
not
to
go
into
motion
to
suppress,
in
lieu
of
the
government's
affidavit
but
leave
the
question
to
the
trial
with
a
reasonable
ruling
that
in
the
light
of
the
affidavit
and
a
voluminous
material,
the
government
said
they
weren't
going
to
introduce
it,
save
the
court's
time
and
save
going
through
all
these
evidences
at
one
point.
he
said
i
am
not
give
you
a
general
motion
to
suppress.
we'll
let
them
challenge
anything
that
looks
to
have
any
problem
about
it
at
the
trial.
now
at
the
trial
they
were
allowed
to
examine
at
each
bit
of
evidence
introduced
ask
each
witness
on
what
his
testimony
was
based
without
question.
and
then
towards
the
end
of
the
trial
they
were
asked
to
suggest,
we
believe
that
every
single
item
of
evidence
could
be
established
to
where
it
came
from,
source
in
the
record,
that's
right
there,
where
it
came
from,
the
leads
and
clues.
we
believe
that
there
is
nothing
suggesting
that
any
of
it
came
from
leads
and
clues
and
antecedent
history
spelled
out
where
it
came
in
question.
now
the
judge
went
further,
three
times
he
asked
the
court
--
asked
the
counsel
to
go
through
the
record
what
exhibit,
what
item,
do
you
have
any
question
about,
the
government
has
told
us
where
it
came
from
â€“
they
--
the
witnesses
have
said
they
got
these
before
1948,
1949,
what
item
do
you
have
any
question
about,
three
times
he
asked
them.
and
the
third
time
as
on
2080
just
prior
the
point
which
you
were
referring,
he
says
i
thought
i
should
not
act
about
giving
you
an
opportunity,
talking
to
mr.
stryker
the
court,
give
you
an
opportunity
and
mr.
wessel
the
prosecutor
if
he
wish
to
reply
to
any
to
go
through
the
record
of
this
case
and
show
to
me
any
item
which
gave
you
any
foundation
for
such
a
hearing
and
that
is
the
memorandum
which
i
have
asked.
no
memorandum
was
submitted.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
make
no
exception
at
any
level
either
at
the
court
of
appeals
or
here
depending
(inaudible).
it's
hard
to
say
in
a
conspiracy
case,
i
do
not
believe
there
was
instruction
since
the
question
is
not
raised
by
lawn
at
the
trial
and
no
one,
it
occurred
to
no
one
if
the
check
was
tainted
if
it
was.
we
think
it
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
not.
it
would
certainly
have
affected
nardone
language
to
prove
that
a
substantial
portion
of
a
case
against
him
was
based
on
fruit
of
poisonous
tree.
now
it
could
be
argued
and
we
will
not
deny
that
that
check
is
an
important
item
of
evidence
as
against
the
petition
of
lawn,
not
as
--
i
wouldn't
quite
play
it
up
the
way
the
petitioner's
counsel
did
yesterday,
but
it
was
a
substantial
bit
of
evidence.
but
as
to
petitioner
giglio
and
livorsi,
who
do
not,
giglio
does
not
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
which
was
overwhelming.
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
it
as
(inaudible)
beyond
question
of
guilt.
certainly
a,
if
a
court
should
believe
this
the,
over
the
quite
reversal
or
remand
for
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
check
was
in
fact
tainted
or
whether
or
not
it
was
in
fact
prejudicial
error
which
will
be
the
remedy
i
was
suggesting
on
it
did
not
accept
any
of
our
other
grounds
that
we
do
not
accept
the
conviction
without
having
a
remand
to
see
whether
there
was
any
precedence,
whether
there
was
any,
well
it
was
considered
by
the
party
tainted
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
been
significant
and
they
do
not
raise
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is,
that
is
correct,
they
do
not
urge
the
same
errors,
i
think
that
the
--
i'd
ask
the
court
to
consider
our
brief
and
remarks
brought
forth
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
be
very
happy
to,
your
honor.
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
do
so
which
i
did
not
have
yesterday.
the
witnesses
â€“
in
the
first
place
the
language
in
question,
the
language
in
which
the
summation
to
which
exception
was
taken
is
that
he
said,
i
vouch
for
lubben
and
roth.
i,
and
when
i
say
â€˜i'
i
am
speaking
to
the
district
attorney'
office,
i
tell
you
why
we
vouch
for
them,
we
vouch
for
them
because
we
think
they
are
telling
the
truth.
the
standard
rule
of
evidence,
which
rule
of
ethics
from
which
the
government
presented
the
case
is
it
should
not
put
a
witness
on
but
to
think
he
is
telling
the
truth.
we
would
think
that
by
itself
in
the
light
of
law
summations
will
be
no
mistake
for
the
government
to
say
we
think
to
tell
a
jury
we
would
not
put
a
witness
on
unless
we
thought
he
was
now
telling
the
truth.
whether
or
not
that
is
true
by
itself,
i
might
say
at
this
point
he
did
not
make
any
reference
to
any
outside
facts,
he
didn't
say
we
know
what
they
are
telling
is
truth,
he
didn't
say,
well
what
we
know
we
have
information
indicating
what
they
say
is
true,
he
said
we
think
they
are
telling
the
truth.
now
we
believe
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
haven't
got
the
words
in
front
of
you
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
does
it
give
the
record
reference
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
3587,
well
the
prosecutor
himself
brought
out
they
had
committed
perjury
and
lying
a
number
of
times
and
the
question
is
he
telling
truth
now
or
isn't
he
telling
the
truth
now.
lubben
summarily
he
lied
in
college
town
there
is
not
question
about
that.
that
was
brought
out.
i
know
on
my
direct
examination,
i
didn't
try
and
hide
it
from
the
jury.
let's
turn
to
lubben.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
we
vouch
for
it,
we
put
them
on
because
we
are
going
to
have
you
believe
their
testimony.
we
think
their
testimony
at
this
trial
is
credible.
now
there
is
no
indication
that
we
are
based,
the
bet
is
based
on
anything
outside
the
record.
as
i
say
i
think
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
its
standing
by
itself,
this
would
be
proper
or
not.
petitioners'
counsel
--
the
opening
statements,
petitioners'
counsel
at
the
opening
statement
had
said
that
this
was
a
conspiracy.
this
was
a
prosecution
brought
in
bad
faith.
he
went
to
accuse
the
former
united
states
attorney
for
improper
conduct
and
then
he
said,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
present
prosecutor.
he
would
not
have
put
these
people
on
unless
he
has
been
instructed.
this
is
the
opening
statement.
they
wouldn't
do
it
unless
they
have
been
instructed.
the
implication
being
they
know
their
lying,
they
disbelieve
them,
they
wouldn't
put
them
on,
unless
they
have
been
ordered
to
do
so
by
someone
who
is
in
on
this
crooked
arrangement.
now
the
answer
of
the
defendants
here
is
oh
that
refers
the
opening
six
weeks
before
the
commission.
i
think
the
opening
statement
makes
a
(inaudible)
question
on
the
jury
and
the
summation
of
the
first
occasion
the
government
had
and
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
opening
â€“
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
2904
and
2905
in
volume
4
of
the
record.
it's
reprinted
on
page
54
of
the
government's
brief.
they
have
been
instructed
or
in
my
opinion
they
never
would
have
done
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
judge
made
a
three-page
instruction
on
credibility
calling
specific
attention
to
roth
and
lubben,
asked
the
jury
to
examine
their
testimony
with
particular
care.
now
there
is
one
reference
to
the
summation
not
given
in
our
brief
which
i
like
your
honors
to
consider
in
this
regard,
at
page
2531.
this
is
defendants'
summation
of
the
jury
just
before
the
government's
answer.
i
will
tell
you
where
the
fraud
is,
where
the
conspiracy
is
right
there
in
the
government
witnesses.
the
government
witness
included
government
employees,
lower
middle
paragraph
2531.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
believe
that
language
was
mild.
he
stated
he
believed
the
witnesses
were
telling
the
truth
and
certainly
justified
his
answer
to
a
charge
that
the
prosecution
has
brought
in
bad
faith.
the
prosecutor
would
not
have
put
the
witnesses
unless
he
has
been
instructed
that
there
was
fraud
and
conspiracy
among
the
government
witness.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
objection
was
made
in
the
summation.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
requests
for
instructions
in
this
regard
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
that's
the
fact.
that
was
only
testimony
said
to
be
tainted.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
read
the
testimony
somewhat
differently
than
mr.
delaney
does.
i'd
like
to
point
out
for
example
as
relates
to
mr.
roth,
the
colloquy
and
cross
examination
which
i
previously
referred
on
1322,
1323,
these
stages
without
objection,
without
being
stopped.
mr.
stryker
cross
examined
mr.
roth
as
to
whether
he
had
appeared
before
the
1952
grand
jury,
whether
he
had
been
asked
to
produce
all
the
documents
he
had
for
the
1952
grand
jury,
whether
documents
which
he
had
recently
produced
before
the
court,
at
the
government's,
next
government
witnesses
were
among
those
which
he
had
brought
before
the
1952
grand
jury.
he
was
--
he
asked
if
they
were
not,
that
he
had
not
found
the
document
until
after
the
1952
grand
jury.
as
to
mr.
present,
he
was
stopped.
mr.
present
was
a
critical
government
agent
who
brought
all
the
figures
together.
he
was
stopped
when
the
questioning
came
forward
and
i
think
both
briefs
refer
to
the
references
on
that,
he
was
stopped
when
he
was
asked
if
he
had
considered
in
making
an
audit
other
evidence
and
what
evidence,
and
the
prosecutor
told
the
judge,
we
had
no
objection
to
this
question,
but
it
was
going
to
lead
to
fact
that
mr.
present
had
seen
documents
that
had
been
brought
before
the
1952
grand
jury.
mr.
stryker
would
ask
the
questions
the
other
way
around,
as
to
where
the
antecedents
for
everything
he
had
in
the
record,
there
will
be
no
exception,
but
prosecutor
was
afraid
mr.
stryker
would
seek
to
get
in
the
record
by
his
own
questioning
some
of
the
evidence
which
the
government
accepted
did
not
want
to
get
in
the
record
did
not
want
to
base
the
conviction
on,
and
asked
if
it
be
done,
it
would
be
done
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
at
that
point
mr.
present
was
stopped.
if
he
was
not
stopped
when
he
asked
how
we
got
figures,
whether
the
figure,
where
did
you
get
this,
when
did
that
document
come,
when
did
the
government
agent
first
ask
you
about
this.
were
your
first
question
about
this,
may
1951,
early
1948,
those
questions
and
i
can
only
say
that
if
you
look
at
the
references
in
which
we
show,
given
the
brief,
which
explains
where
the
documents
came
from,
you'll
find
bulk
of
it
is
brought
out
and
also
we
believe
there
was
no
limitation
on
cross
examination,
find
the
clue
that
lead
to
the
piece
of
evidence.
the
only
time
mr.
present
was
really
shut
off,
was
when
he
was
--
was
the
judge
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
bring
in
the
evidence,
tainted
evidence
before
the
--
by
cross
examination,
bring
it
out
which
would
have
worried
the
trial,
he
wasn't
sure
the
waiver
would
account
for
that.
he
was
also
stopped
when
he
indicated,
and
we
believe
that
you
read
any
question
in
context,
you
will
that
see
mr.
stryker
was
directing
his
questions
at
what
was
before
the
1953
grand
jury.
he
was
stopped
regularly
on
that
line
of
inquiry
and
the
primary
purpose
of
his
questions
throughout
is
the
issue
which
has
now
been
removed
from
the
case,
that
is
the
invalidity
of
the
1953
indictment.
he
was
trying
to
upset
the
entire
case.
he
was
not
interested
in
excluding
a
particular
--
at
least
he
did
not
demonstrate
much
interest,
excluding
a
particular
item,
but
again
the
indictment
dismissed
and
most
of
the
questions
which
they
have
referred
in
their
brief
are
cases
where
he
was
questioning
now
what
was
before
--
leone
the
former
prosecutor,
what
did
you
bring
before
the
1953
grand
jury?
