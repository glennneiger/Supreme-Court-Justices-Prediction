justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
those
--
i
want
to
know
in
the
first
place
whether
i
can
rightly
read
that
as
an
assurance
by
the
district,
us
assistant
district
attorney
in
charge
of
the
prosecution
that
when
he
says
any
evidence,
he
means
either
directly
a
clue
within
the
scope
of
nardone,
the
second
nardone
decision
and
whether
that
is
an
assurance
that
no
such
evidence
will
be
used
in
the
prosecution
which
means
that
everything
leading
up
to
and
the
trial
itself
an
assurance
on
which
is
the
united
states
district
judge
had
a
right
to
rely
that
that
would
be
scrupulously
kept.
