mr.
pollack.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
was
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
conceded
that
is
outlawed
proof
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
manner
did
he
try
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
could
you
tell
us
briefly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
the
court
say
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
i'm
talking
about
the
trial
court,
what
did
the
trial
court
just
say
in
response
to
that
statement
of
mr.
stryker's?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
said
that
mr.
stryker
was
trying
to
exclude
tainted
evidence
and
he
made
this
statement
which
you
just
quoted
a
moment
ago
and
he
said
he
didn't
want
to
overlook
anything.
now
what
did
the
court
say
in
response
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
limit
him
in
any
way
in
his
examination
of
witnesses
in
order
to
find
out
if
documents
were
or
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
tainted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i'm
not
challenging
mr.
stryker's
method,
i
was
trying
to
get
the
reaction
of
the
court,
trail
court,
to
the
efforts
of
mr.
stryker
to
establish
that
there
might
be
tainted
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
fisher,
if
you
are
going
to
talk
about
this
check,
would
you
mind
starting
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
check
and
just
pace
it
through,
right
through
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
you
can
do
that
briefly
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
while
he
was
before
the
grand
jury
or
about
that
time
â€“
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
based
upon
the
language
which
precedes
it,
in
which
he
says
the
united
states
attorney
has
sworn
that
this
material
will
not
be
used
in
the
future
course
of
this
case
and
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
this
oath
is
sufficient.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
the
oath
is
sufficient.
chief
justice
earl
warren
granting
the
defendant's
motion
to
suppress
at
this
time
would
necessitate
an
investigation
of
all
the
government's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
did
have
some
reliance
upon
the
oath
of
the
district
attorney
that
they
would
not
be
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not
stay
with
the
record
first
and
then
we'll
go
into
what
was
outside
the
record,
wouldn't
that
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
stay
with
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
take
the
record
as
we
have
got
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
mislead
the
court
about,
as
to
whether
it
was
the
same
check
or
not
(inaudible),
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
the
same
check.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
an
entirely
different
thing
then
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
you
to
ask
this?
before
that
colloquy
took
place,
was
the
issue
ever
raised
by
mr.
stryker,
at
the
trial
concerning
the
admissibility
of
any
of
this
tainted
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
as
to
whether
it
was
use
at
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
he
cross
examine
the
witness,
as
to
whether
something
was
used
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
was
mr.
lubben
for
instance,
how
would
mr.
lubben
know
whether
a
document
was
introduced
before
the
grand
jury
or
not?
the
prosecutor
be
the
only
one
who
would
know
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher
may
i
ask
you
if
there
is
any
place
in
this
record
prior
to
the
admission
on
this
check,
where
mr.
stryker
represented
to
the
court
what
his
position
was
as
to
this
illegal
entity,
the
so
called
tainted
evidence
and
what
he
was
trying
to
get
from
the
court
by
reasoning,
by
way
of
an
assurance,
that
it
would
not
be
used
against
his
client.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
the
same
judge
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher
then
i
understand
--
as
i
understand
you
have
no
place
in
this
record
prior
to
the
admission
of
this
particular
check
that
mr.
stryker
the
--
mr.
stryker
make
any
objection
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it
was
tainted
by
reason
of
that
first
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
lawn
a
member
of
the
partnership?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
william
giglio
and
frank
livorsi,
petitioners,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
delaney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
an
outstanding
information
against
him
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
they
knew
of
this
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
motion
mr.
delaney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
delaney
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
suppose
this
court
was
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
now
give
the
defendants
a
copy
of
the
minutes
of
the
1953
grand
jury
and
then
afford
you
a
hearing
as
to
whether
any
tainted
evidence
was
used
in
the
case
and
if
so,
if
it
was
prejudicial
error
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
fair
disposition
of
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
--
even
though
a
full
hearing
would
show
that
that
there
was
no
abuse
and
that
no
tainted
evidence
was
used?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
read
your
briefs
in
the
case,
i
rather
thought
there
was
an
animation
in
there
that
perhaps
that
would
be
one
solution
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know
but
that's
what
the
hearing
would
disclose,
but
suppose
the
record
shows
--
suppose
that
you
did
get
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
showed
that
there
was
no
tainted
evidence
used
there,
would
that
--
wouldn't
that
sound,
my
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
can
see
your
point,
but
assume
that
you
are
afforded
the
opportunity
to
do
that
in
your
hearing,
would
it
be
an
equitable
result
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
it
is
--
it
would
be
one
solution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
delaney
we've
taken
so
much
of
your
time,
but
if
you
want
to
take
five
minutes
to
sum
up
you
may
do
it,
if
you
want
to
leave
it
on
your
briefs
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
all
right,
all
right
you
may
have
it.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stryker
said
i
think
i
can
do
that
and
save
your
time
and
strength,
he
never
did
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
delaney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
that
fact
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher
would
you
mind
responding
to
that
statement
that
mr.
delaney
just
made
that
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
cross
examining
mr.
roth
and
also
the
government
accountant,
that
judge
walsh
refused
the
opportunity
because
proper
foundation
had
not
been
laid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
