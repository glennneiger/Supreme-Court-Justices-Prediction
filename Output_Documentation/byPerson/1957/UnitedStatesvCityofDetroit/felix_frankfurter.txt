justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
really,
is
that
what
you
are
saying,
the
question
therefore
comes
down
whether
when
the
government
does
make
a
contract
like
that,
and
it
is
empowered
to
make
such
a
contract
i
take
it,
it
lifts
the
tax
burden
from
everybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
either,
that
was
my
question.
on
the
basis
of
such
a
contract
which
the
government
is
empowered
to
make,
when
it
chooses
to
make
it,
it
creates
a
situation
whereby
immunity
results.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
let
me
put
my
question
again
because
it
is
important.
of
course
the
government
can
give
(inaudible)
if
it
wants
to,
that's
a
totally
different
--
that
isn't
your
proposition
here
that
it
came
(inaudible).
your
proposition
is
that
when
this
contract,
when
this
lease
was
made,
which
the
government
was
free
to
make
or
not
free
to
make,
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
law,
immunity
results
from
it,
because
of
the
relation
of
the
arrangement
to
the
united
sates.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
means
that
if
the
government
--
if
the
contract
--
if
the
lease
didn't
provide
or
if
there
wasn't
a
statute
which
specifically
authorized
michigan
to
impose
such
a
tax,
it
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
government
chooses
â€“
it
confers
such
a
benefit
upon
the
lessee,
he
has
the
right
too,
constitutional
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
appreciate
the
choices
that
advocate
is
making
their
argument
but
i
wonder
why
you,
why
you
say
your
second
argument
is
the
statute,
because
if
the
statute
is
pretty
clear
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
takes
care
of
all
my
worries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
good
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling,
if
you
don't
mind
what
spell
that
out
concretely
for
which
payments
are
made
in
lieu
of
taxes,
how
are
the
payments
made
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
just
doesn't
pay
the
taxes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
--
these
are
ad
hoc
measures,
my
brother
burton
reminds
of
that
in
the
housing
act,
there's
a
general
provision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
draw
any,
do
you
get
any
comfort
out
of
those
specific
enactment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
problem
as
a
general
problem
or
specific,
ad
hoc?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
they
are
100
years
mr.
fisher,
i'm
not
greatly
impressed
by
that
century
because
up
to
the
dravo
decision,
as
justice
roberts
pointed
in
his
dissent
alleghany,
you
had
the
whole
atmosphere,
the
whole
momentum
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
it
was
very
different
from
happened
after
dravo,
but
the
whole
thing
shifted
from
a,
if
i
may
respectfully
say
to
rather
abstract
discussion
of
federal
state
relations
to
the
concreteness
of
the
dravo
and
even
the
concreteness
of
alleghany,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
many
--
are
there
many
such
bills
in
lieu
of
bills?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
maybe
--
would
you
think
it
was
fantastic
for
me
to
draw
a
contrary
inference
from
yours
to
say
that,
that
shows
that
on
the
whole
maybe
congress
going
about
its
business
the
way
it
does
case
by
case,
maybe
congress
thereby
indicated
the
immunity
is
not
wisely
left
to
the
government,
that
this
court
should
reconsider
the
general
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
there
that
the
congress
has
shown
a
commendable
respect
for
the
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
john
kenney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
answer
means,
if
would,
that's
his
understanding
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
his
view
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher
i'd
like
to
pursue
a
question
i
put
to
you
earlier.
in
as
much
as
these
immunizations
are
implied,
as
you
indicate,
we
haven't
got
a
case
here
where
the
congress
of
the
united
states
affirmatively
says
that
they
shall
not
tax.
that
may
raise
a
question
as
to
whether,
to
what
extent
congress
of
the
united
states
can
withdraw
from
the
taxing
power
of
a
state,
power
that
it
otherwise
enjoys,
but
assume
as
i
will,
because
i'm
ready
to
--
that
legislation,
whatever
maybe
the
answer,
argumentatively,
congressional
explicit
legislation
could
withdraw
any
time
in
even
remote
interest
of
the
united
states
from
the
taxing
power
of
the
state,
we
haven't
got
that
situation,
we
got
the
reverse
situation.
we've
got
immunity
derived
impliedly
from
the
relation
between
state
and
federal
government
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
that's
the
basis
of
this,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
legislative
history
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
though
that
--
now,
since
the
history
of
this
problem
is
a
history
of
judicial
implications
from
state,
federal
relations
and
one
can
be
as
you
indicated
a
little
while
ago
in
agreement,
i
suppose
one
can't
disagree,
that
dravo,
what
i
call
dravo,
the
whole
series
of
dravo
decisions
made
a
considerable
shift
to
the
attitude
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
considerable
shift,
or
important
shift,
a
far
reaching
shift,
took
it
out
of
more
or
less
mechanical
or
generalized
category
and
wanted
to
find
some
real
burden,
some
real
incursion,
some
real
hampering
or
embarrassment,
financial
or
otherwise
to
the
activities
of
the
federal
government,
you
still
agree
with
me,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
not
such
a
dravo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
dravo
destroys
the
notion
that
merely
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
to
figure
out
a
few
extra
dollars
or
many,
many
dollars,
isn't
enough
to
withdraw
--
to
give
immunity
that
is
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
after
this
long
speech
what
i
like
to
put
to
you
is
this,
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
we
may
draw
a
jural
premise
from
legislation,
particularly
a
series
of
enactments
and
if
we
have
in
this
domain
a
series
of
ad
hoc
provisions
and
the
general
attitude
on
the
part
of
congress
whereby
they
feel
urged
or
they
feel
a
sense
of
injustice
or
they
feel
unfairness
to
the
state
more
particular
to
continue
to
this
immunity,
why
doesn't
that
afford
us
a
spring
board
for
working
this
thing
out
judiciously
so
as
to
carry
on
the
dravo
premise,
that's
my
problem
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
a
vast
amount
of
tax
law
is
based
just
on
that
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
against
that
other
cases
and
the
tax
measures
in
which
state
taxes
are
more
heavily
fall
on
--
company
theretofore
are
immune
from
taxation,
because
the
government
owned
it.
in
other
words,
if
an
estate
has
a
lot
of
bonds,
they
were
bonds
which
as
such
are
immune,
you
can
more
heavily
impose
on
a
state
tax
on
an
estate
that
include,
because
of
the
immunity
they
have
enjoyed
the
life
time
of
the
(inaudible)
and
when
you
say
the
government,
of
course
the
government
grants
the
privilege,
but
the
fellow
who
gets
it,
gets
something
that
some
other
people
don't
get.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say,
you
say
there
is
a
real
disturb
--
it
will
be
disturbing
for
a
judicial
pronouncement
that
the
privilege
of
having
a
leasehold
from
the
government
is
taxable,
isn't
that
true,
do
you
think
that
will
be
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
crude
way
for
the
judiciary
to
enter
into
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
do
it
as
to
other
leaseholds?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
taking
about
government
leaseholds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
worked
out
some
sophisticated
formula
which
would
gain
a
large
proportion
of
this
tax,
do
you
think
it
was
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
saying
that
michigan
in
effect
said
we
can't
tax
this
as
such,
but
we've
taxed
this
by
saying,
in
fact
it
is
just
as
much
as
it
were
a
tax
as
such
by
saying
it's
a
privilege
for
having
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that's
a
crude
thing,
but
a
sophisticated
formula
would
be
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean,
i
don't
mean
an
invasive
one,
but
one
that
tried
to
work
out
the
cash
value
of
having
this
privilege?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
this
pulled
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
what
page
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
these
properties
was
exempt,
was
exempted
properties
--
exempted
under
michigan
law,
one
of
them
was
municipally
exempted,
would
you
mind
stating
in
a
word
what
the
basis
of
municipal
exemption
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
didn't
you
say
that
one
of
them
was
exempted
by
some
municipal
--
under
some
municipal
was
leased
--
property
leased
by
a
city
which
enjoyed
exemption,
one
of
these
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
highland
park.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
property
was
exempt,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
was
it
exempt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
are
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
are
going
to
say
this
is
not
an
evasion
for
hitting
federally
exempt
property,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
could,
you
could
say
these
about
the
macallen
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
you
could
say
many
things
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
argument
is,
it's
like
miller
and
milwaukee,
now
what
do
you
do
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
here
specifically
aiming
at
government
derived
property
interest,
a
government
derived
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
it
any
less
so
that
you
also
cover
some
other
exemption?
does
that
change
the
character
of
the
general
proposition
of
miller
against
milwaukee,
namely
that
if
you
want
to
bring
that
pigeon
down,
you
can't
do
it,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
whether
you
bring
the
pigeon
down
from
front
or
back?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
also
hit
other
pigeons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
also
hit
the
exemptions
of
michigan
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
mr.
o'
connor
instead
of
this
compendious
provision,
what's
the
number
of
this
statute
104?
justice
felix
frankfurter
189,
suppose
instead
of
in
the
form
--
suppose
instead
of
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
it,
section
1
said
all
leaseholds
from
government
immune,
federal
government
immune
properties,
shall
be
assessed
on
the
value
of
the
property
for
the
privilege
of
having
such
a
leasehold.
section
2,
all
leaseholds
that
were
immune
from
taxation,
because
owned
by
the
state
of
michigan
shall
be
assessed,
shall
be
taxed
to
the
full
value
of
such
immunized
state
property.
section
3,
all
property
derived
and
owned
by
cities
on
lease,
et
cetera
in
section
4,
all
property
of
charitable
religious
organizations
enjoying
immunity
as
such,
all
of
the
statutes
are
like
that,
four
sections,
putting
in
all
the
categories
of
property
as
such
exempt
for
taxing
the
privilege
of
having
a
leasehold
thereof.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
general
act
that
expires
next
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
generality?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
all
related
to
reconstruction
finance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
presence
of
the
applicable
acts
for
leaseholds
made
today
this
year,
are
they
covered
by
acts
or
are
they
all
covered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
street
you
said
several
times
this
can't
be
dealt
with
by
congress,
it
must
be
dealt
with
locally.
now
if
that's
so
that
for
me
at
least
could
have
a
very
important
bearing
on
striking
the
adjustment
between
the
state
and
federal
authority,
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
just
an
authorization
by
congress
so
that
each
state
do
what
michigan
tried
to
do
would
do
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it
could
exactly
what
it
does
about
taxing
bank
staff,
national
bank
staff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
can't
they
make
the
same
qualifications
that
you
make,
i
don't
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it
all
gets
down
then
to
amounts,
does
it,
because
you
must
accept
you
rely
on
--
you
talk
about
macallen,
i
think
the
light
is
taken
out
of
macallen
by
educational
film?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
the
facts
found
so,
that
doesn't
prove
sinister
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
little,
why
do
you
say
little?
suppose
there
were
in
detroit
religious
institutions
(inaudible)
like
the
trinity
church
in
new
york
with
vast
holding
and
all
of
it
exempt,
would
that
change
the
legal
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
you
must
--
then
it
does
turn
or
the
question
of
directive
tort
is
decisive
and
you
say
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
bulk
of
the
property
which
feels
this
tax
happens
to
be
or
is,
not
to
put
in
a
question
begging
words,
is
federally
exempt.
you
prove
sinister
purpose,
do
you
prove
design,
this
record
against
federal
property
otherwise
and
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
the
property
is
federally
exempt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
first
had
a
statute
which
tried
to
reach
it
and
then
it
didn't
and
--
but
i
put
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
put
it
to
you
that
this
isn't
the
miller
milwaukee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
put
it
to
you
that
macallen
really
is
--
is
hardly
breathing
anymore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
goal
across
the
board
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
whole
board
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
all
tax
exempt
properties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
why
they
are
taxing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
they
are
taxing.
in
order
to
equalize
taxation
of
owners
of
property
or
manufacturers
of
property,
they
want
to
have
every
owner
who
enjoys
a
certain
privilege,
a
certain
source
of
power
a
part
of
his
running
expenses
of
the
government.
and
they
take
care
of
all
the
other
fellows
by
one
form
of
taxation
and
they
say
you
have
a
certain,
you
are
given
a
certain
power,
you
may
have
been
given
it
by
a
certificate
to
have
a
water
powered
plant,
you
may
have
been
given
it
because
somebody
left
you
some
money
and
you
have
an
estate
tax
or
you
may
have
been
given
it
by
the
united
states
government
and
that
is
what
we
call
in
the
law
generally
a
license
tax,
a
privilege
tax.
it
isn't
any
to
less
privilege
because
(inaudible)
is
the
grant
holder
of
the
privilege
and
you
can't
cut
under
with
reference
to
this
particular
type
of
privilege,
the
whole
rate
division
of
the
tax
law
between
taxing
property
because
you
own
property
and
taxing
--
in
fact
imposing
a
tax
on
a
person,
because
all
taxation
falls
on
a
person,
it
doesn't
fall
on
the
unanimous
thing,
it
falls
on
person,
because
he
is
in
possession
of
certain
prerogative
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher
the
secretary
of
defense
or
the
postmaster
in
detroit
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
government,
but
ever
since
dravo
you
can
no
longer
speak
of
any
fellow
who
does
work
for
the
