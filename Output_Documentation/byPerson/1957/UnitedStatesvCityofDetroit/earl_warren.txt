mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher
may
i
ask
how
it
is
that
the
full
burden
of
this
tax
falls
on
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
a
legal
obligation,
that
is
just
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
just
decided
to
do
that,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we
can't
proceed
here
on
the
theory
that
if
we
decide
this
case
against
the
government
that
we
are
throwing
the
burden
on
the
government
as
a
matter
of
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
are
those
the
same
thing,
is
this
an
answer
to
what
justice
frankfurter
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it,
this
conversation
we
have
been
having
back
and
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
leaves
you
to
by
comparison
with
this
case?
you
say
you
take
a
lot
of
comfort
out
of
them
doing
that
in
a
lot
of
cases
now
where
do
you
get
your
comfort
in
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
been
done
in
these
other
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
fisher
isn't
there
a
lot
of
difference
between
the
kind
of
in
lieu
taxes
that
the
situations
in
which
the
government
pays
in
lieu
taxes
by
congressional
enactment
say
under
the
lanham
act
or
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
or
under
the
housing
act
and
things
of
that
kind
where
there
would
be
an
exemption
and
where
they
want
to
take
care
of
the
local
governments
because
they
know
the
necessities
of
local
government
where
they
are
furnishing
police
protection
and
fire
protection,
schools
and
highways
and
things
of
that
kind
for
these
great
industries,
isn't
that
one
thing
and
isn't
it
quite
another
thing
when
you
get
a
situation
of
this
kind
and
isn't
it
just
as
normal
to
believe
that
congress
thought
that
the
lessees
in
cases
of
this
kind
were
subject
to
local
taxes?
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
thought
that
lessees
of
this
kind
are
exempt
and
should
be
exempt
because
of
the
government
exemption?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
was
mr.
kenney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
with
that
page
26
for
a
moment,
right
after
the
question
and
answer
you
read,
senator
byrd
said,
“of
course
there
is
a
question
involved
there
of
taking
these
plants
and
leasing
them
to
private
companies
and
the
private
companies
making
a
profit.”
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
they
should
not
pay
taxes
to
the
local
and
state
governments,
very
much
what
we
have
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
mr.
kenney
said,
“my
own
feeling
is
senator
that
taxes
should
be
paid
on
property
that
is
used
for
that
purpose.”
the
federal
government
in
making
its
terms
of
lease
should
agree
with
the
local
authorities
that
they
will
pay
the
amount
of
taxes
that
would
have
otherwise
accrued.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
whenever
you
have
a
formula
to
try
to
keep
one
particular
class
of
property
from
escaping,
i
suppose
you
could
call
that
a
discriminatory
--
that
discriminatory,
but
do
you
have
the
same
sense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
there
any
discrimination
or
unfair
discrimination
in
a
city
trying
to
see
whether
a
manufacturer
who
comes
into
the
community
and
who
demands
fire
protection,
police
protection
and
all
the
other
services
of
the
city
shall
not
escape
taxation?
and
let's
just
take
--
let's
just
take
some
particular
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can
recall
one
were
the
city
of
35,000
people,
overnight
the
government
brought
a
contractor
in
there
to
build
a
shipyard,
65,000
people
came
there
to
work
in
the
period
of
a
–in
a
period
of
year-and-a-half.
schools,
highways,
housing,
hospitals
everything
that
community
had
to
spend
money
for,
for
all
those
people,
is
there
any
--
is
there
anything
wrong
in
the
city
trying
to,
to
prevent
an
operator
of
that
kind
from
paying
taxes
that
will
enable
it
to
operate
the
city
government
on
a
somewhat
fair
basis
with
other
citizens
of
the
community?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
you
had
another,
suppose
you
had
another
client
alongside
borg
plant
that
was
exactly
the
same
in
size
and
construction
and
that
was
conducted
on
it
exactly
the
same
kind
of
an
operation.
only
it
was
a
private
individual
and
was
individually
owned.
how
can
you
say
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
charge
this
man
the
same
if
he
has
a
complete
use
of
this
property,
the
same
as
you
would
charge
the
other
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
o'connor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
any
of
the
land
that
is
given
--
allotted
to
the
state
of
michigan
such
as
school
lands
or
other
lands
if
the
state
leased
those
properties
the
same
tax
would
apply
to
them,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
we
are
talking
about
for
purposes
like
this,
taking
about
for
manufacturing
plants
or
anything
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
leased
any
of
those
school
lands,
the
lessee
would
be
subject
to
this
tax
just
the
same
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess,
we'll
recess
now
mr.
o'connor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
o'connor
do
you
have
two
rolls,
do
you
have
a
personal
property
roll
and
a
real
property
tax
roll?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
does
this
get
on
your
real
property
roll,
i
notice
this
exhibit
says
city
of
detroit
personal
property
assessment
roll.
now
that's
different,
how
do
you
put
it
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
formally
here
and
then
put
it
no
your
real
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
is
this
a
third
kind
of
a
roll,
you
have
your
real
estate
roll
and
you
have
your
personal
property
tax
roll
and
is
this
a
third
kind
of
tax
roll?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
not
criticizing
and
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
but
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
because
i
should
maybe
have
understood
you,
but
i
didn't.
i
do
want
to
know
if
these
pieces
of
property
that
are
on
in
this
exhibit
97
are
included
in
your
real
property
roll
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
your
real
property
rate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are,
all
right,
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
street.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
street
in
your
time
to
prove
muskegon,
how
do
you
assess
this
property?
do
you
assess
it
as
personal
property
or
does
it
go
on
the
real
property
roll
as
we
were
told?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
alright.
