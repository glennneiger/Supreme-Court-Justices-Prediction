justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
the
real
effect
of
this
is,
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
that
michigan
has
a
use
tax
which
implies
that
nobody
in
the
state,
except
those
who
have
leased
government
tax
exempt
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
affect
is
if
you
have
a
(inaudible)
which
applies,
maybe
it's
all
right,
(inaudible)
did
you
have
an
act
which
the
legislature
passed,
for
the
use
tax
upon
industrial
uses
of
government
property,
for
the
use
of
government
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
applies
for
no
one
else
in
the
state
except
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
tax
imposed
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
people,
any
industrial
companies
in
the
city
of
detroit,
this
is
detroit
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
uses
of
properties
that
are
of
state
property
that
have
to
pay
this
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
brown
record
in
number
26.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
i
got
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that
last
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
error?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
you
had
a
duplication?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
you
are
saying
is
that
you
have
a
tax,
a
use
tax
on
â€“
that
you
described,
which
contains
within
its
classification
not
merely
leased
property
or
the
use
of
property
leased
for
the
united
states,
leased
for
michigan
on
any
of
its
subsidiaries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
property
which
is
leased
from
the
state
of
michigan
based
on
the
same
basis,
the
same
rate
as
though
it
was
leased
from
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
houston
hayes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
houston
hayes,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
they
leased
it
from
the
city
of,
city
of
detroit
or
state
of
michigan
or
whatever
it
was
and
then
under
michigan
law
that
property
is
exempt
from
taxation
as
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
aside
from
the
difference
in
name
between
this
tax
and
the
other
taxes
you
had
put
us
through,
is
there
any
valid
distinction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
precisely
the
same
rate
of
taxation
that's
in
this
county,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
the
same
in
everything
except
the
preference
for
which
it's
clear
to
be
levied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
cited
any
of
the
interstate
commerce
cases
which
have
held
that
immune
interstate
trade
can
have
a
tax
levied
against
it
measured
by
the
total
value
of
the
interstate
trade?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
challenge
the
tax
on
the
basis
of
it
being
excessive
by
reason
of
the
way
it's
measured
or
the
only
challenge
to
it
is
based
on
immunity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
religious
institutions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
gets
down
to
a
question
largely
on
that
point,
does
it
not,
of
whether
there
is
a
discriminatory
classification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
exemptions
in
your
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
exemptions
in
your
statute
that
seek
out
any
members
of
the
particular
class
that
rent
tax
immune
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
include
--
is
that
a
complete
classification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
believe
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
reserve
your
point
of
the
taxation
of
--
the
value
of
the
leasehold
income.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
difference
i
concur
in
result
(inaudible)
the
state
made
no
effort
to
segregate
the
two,
here
it
maybe
aborted
effort,
but
the
state
has
made
an
effort
to
tax
nothing
but
(inaudible)
concerned
the
value
of
the
leasehold
in
that
case.
now
it
has
fixed
the
value
(inaudible)
raise
of
tax
rate
and
one
value
of
property,
but
do
you
say
that
fixing,
having
one
factor
value
of
the
property
--
deprived
it
of
complete
validity
and
(inaudible).
suppose
instead
of
fixing
it
using
those
two
factors,
it
simply
said
whereas
the
real
estate
tax
without
saying,
real
estate
tax
of
2%
we
fix
the
tax
on
leasehold
interest
as
10%
would
that
been
unconstitutional?
supposing
now
that
the
government
was
not
in,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
affect
this
lease,
don't
you
have
this
problem
here,
what
you
argue
now
seems
to
me
would
be
a
question
of
classification
not
the
question
of
the
other,
unless
we
can
just
simply
infer
from
the
fact
that
this
tax
be
levied
on
property
leased
from
government,
federal
or
state
or
religious,
where
they
have
religious
immunity,
unless
we
can
infer
from
that
there
is
an
invidious
purpose
to
tax
the
property
of
the
government.
i
agree
with
you,
if
we
look
at
sum,
but
are
you
saying
that
looking
in
those
circumstances
we
must
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
tax
on
government
property
and
if
so
what
goes
with
the
michigan
tax
law
insofar
as
the
attempt
to
tax
property
leasehold
value
of
property
owned
by
the
state
and
by
religious
institutions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
excuse
me,
(inaudible).
suppose
the
ones
that
disagree
with
you
about
this
tax
and
think
that
this
is
a
legitimate
tax
on
a
leasehold
interest
except
your
argument
that
we
do
not
look
into
the
words
of
the
statute,
we
try
to
see
just
exactly
how
it
functions,
where
does
that
put
us
in
connection
with
the
other
two,
other
case
if
we
accept
the
idea
we
do
not
look
at
labels,
we
do
not
look
at
names,
but
their
taxes
(inaudible)
the
same
preference
in
the
state
of
michigan
as
this
one
does,
would
it
be
consistent
in
your
way
of
thinking
on
these
cases
to
hold
this
tax
valid
and
hold
the
others
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
doing
what
you
admonish
us
not
to
do
here
looking
at
the
words
that
have
been
used
(inaudible)
practically
functions?
