mr.
harold
m.
street
your
honor,
please
the
court?
i
don't
want
labor
this
too
long,
but
there
are
a
few
issues
that
are
unique
to
a
particular
situation
being
continental
motors
corporation
located
in
muskegon,
county;
and
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
clarify.
it's
quite
apparent
from
reading
opposing
counsel's
brief
that
they
refuse
to
make
a
distinction
between
a
property
tax
and
a
privilege
tax,
refuse
to
concede
that
this
might
conceivably
be
a
privilege
tax
rather
that
a
property
tax
and
treat
it
that
way
throughout
in
both
their
original
brief
and
their
reply
brief.
i
might
say
our
reply
brief,
the
reply
brief
was
only
received
yesterday,
i
will
try
to
cover
it
in
oral
argument
to
save
filing
a
reply
to
the
reply
if
we
can
do
so.
i
think
it
will
clarify
the
picture
somewhat
if
we
point
out
some
of
the
instances
in
which
act
189
does
not
apply.
post
office
is
a
prime
example.
it
could
never
apply
to
a
post
office.
there
is
so
much
made
in
the
footnote
of
the
reply
brief
that
it
might
apply
to
the
pentagon
building,
that
virginia
might
tax
the
secretary
for
occupying
the
pentagon
building.
of
course
that
could
never
happen
under
one
act
189
and
i
don't
think
it
could
happen
under
any
other
the
very
simple
reason
he
is
not
a
private
individual
or
corporation
who
is
using
the
property
in
connection
with
a
business
conducted
for
profit.
so
the
same
is
of
course
true
of
an
army
camp,
marine
base;
any
installation
of
a
sort
that's
not
used
for
profit
it
could
never
apply.
some
reference
has
been
made
to
forest
preserves,
grazing
lands,
i
might
point
out
too,
if
those
are
public
lands,
open
to
the
public
in
the
nature
of
the
park
and
the
government
grants
a
privilege
by
way
of
a
concession
to
someone
to
graze
those
lands,
it
again
would
not
come
within
the
act,
because
of
the
express
exception
as
long
as
that
land
is
again
open
to
use
by
the
public
and
that's
an
important
feature
of
the
act.
we
have
a
forest
preserve
in
michigan
and
perhaps
we
can
explain
this
a
little
more
clearly
as
to
just
what
might
happen.
the
(inaudible)
forest
preserve
is
a
short
distance
north
of
muskegon.
it
is
not
taxable.
it
places
some
burdens
upon
our
local
government
but
certainly
not
unreasonable
burdens
and
we
don't
care
to
tax
it.
but
what
if
the
government
should
lease
that
land
to
be
timbered?
we
know
what
happens
in
michigan
well
enough,
when
such
leases
are
made,
a
large
mill
is
brought
in
that
brings
in
hundreds
of
employees
and
they
bring
their
families,
they
must
be
housed,
their
children
must
be
schooled,
roads
must
be
built
and
fire
protection
afforded.
then
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
say
that
private
entrepreneur,
who
is
harvesting
the
trees
from
that
land
for
profit
should
be
taxed
on
his
privilege
and
this
court
has
held
that
he
maybe
taxed.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
wilson
versus
cook,
where
there
was
an
arkansas
statute
which
imposed
a
privilege
on
anyone
engaged
in
the
business
of
severing
from
the
soil
for
commercial
purposes,
natural
resources
including
timber.
now
in
this
particular
instance,
it
was
a
forest
preserve.
the
trees
belong
to
the
united
states
government
as
well
as
the
land.
this
man
was
given
a
contract
to
sever
the
trees.
he
enjoyed
a
privilege
granted
exclusively
by
the
federal
government
to
harvest
these
trees
yet
a
severance
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
arkansas
was
upheld
by
this
court
on
the
basis
of
james
versus
dravo
and
other
cases.
act
189
would
affect
substantially
the
same
thing
in
this
case,
if
these
forest
preserves
were
leased
for
that
purpose
and
it's
only
just
that
it
should
do
so.
there
is
some
claim
that
continental
stands
in
a
little
different
status
here
than
borg-warner,
because
borg-warner
is
manufacturing
automobile
parts
for
profit,
while
continental
is
confined
to
manufacturing
tank
engines
for
the
army
corps.
there
is
some
difference
on
the
surface,
there
it's
true.
you
want
to
keep
in
mind
however
that
continental
is
competition
chrysler,
general
motors
and
ford
who
also
like
to
make
engines
and
who
are
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
in
competing
with
continental.
we
don't
mind
that
in
muskegon,
but
i
say
in
the
long-run
anything
that
removes
this
spur
of
free
competition
is
going
to
work
detrimental
to
this
government
who
may
think
temporarily
they
are
getting
a
bargain
by
giving
continental
the
plant,
rent
free
and
tax
free.
claim
is
also
made
the
continental
because
of
this
unusual
situation
is
an
agent
or
instrumentality
of
the
government
then
they
sure
of
course
should
be
tax
exempt.
that
situation
i
think
is
covered
in
the
case
cited
in
my
brief
of
henneford
versus
silas
mason
and
i
don't
know
if
i
need
to
elaborate
it
further
here.
that
same
contention
was
made
in
lower
court
and
ultimately
abandoned
on
appeal,
but
what
if
we
did
even
for
the
sake
argument
concede
that
continental
in
this
particular
case
is
an
agent
or
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government?
does
it
afford
an
immunity
under
the
decisions
of
this
court?
i
might
point
out
that
in
united
states
versus
california
which
is
of
course
familiar
to
you
and
is
included
in
an
alr
citation
on
my
brief.
in
referring
to
this
restriction
or
immunity
says
it's
equally
a
restriction
on
taxation
by
either
of
the
instrumentalities
of
the
other.
the
state
instrumentalities
supposedly
enjoy
the
same
privilege.
but
what
have
been
some
of
the
decisions?
the
early
case
of
south
carolina
followed
up
later
by
ohio
verus
helvering
where
the
state
owned
liquor,
sold
it
through
its
own
dispensaries.
this
court
imposed
a
privilege
tax
upon
the
sale
of
that
liquor
and
held
it
valid.
the
court
used
this
rather
colorful
language,
when
the
state
enters
the
marketplace
seeking
customers,
it
divests
itself
of
its
quasi-sovereignty
pro
tanto.
even
more
closely
at
home
when
the
state
of
new
york
owning
the
saratoga
springs
attempted
to
sell
water
through
its
own
public
commission,
the
federal
government
imposed
a
tax
of
$0.02
per
gallon
upon
the
water,
and
this
court
sustained
the
tax
saying
that
it
is
clear
that
where
a
state
engages
in
a
business
in
competition
with
private
enterprise,
it
enjoys
no
special
privilege
or
immunity.
and
even
closer
to
home
is
allen
versus
university
system
where
georgia
setup
a
state
commission
to
operate
the
university
of
georgia
and
georgia
tech
and
they
were
held
liable
for
their
admission
tax
to
the
football
games,
though
conceding
that,
that
was
a
part
of
an
educational
function
and
that
education
was
a
proper
function
of
the
state,
yet
that
tax
was
imposed
and
sustained.
i
don't
believe
first
that
continental
is
an
agent
or
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government,
but
if
so
because
of
its
peculiar
activity,
i
don't
believe
it's
entitled
to
any
immunity
particularly.
now
much
is
made
here
of
the
measure
of
tax.
in
fact
it's
about
the
only
argument
made
against
it,
saying
since
it's
measured
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
property,
that
is
therefore
amounts
to
a
tax
on
the
property
itself.
how
could
such
a
tax
be
measured
and
really
be
fair
and
just?
it
is
suggested
that
perhaps
if
it
were
measured
on
something
like
oh
we'll
say
in
the
case
about
the
severance
of
trees
on
a
board
foot
basis
or
in
the
esso
case
where
you
sustained
a
tax
of
$0.06
per
gallon
on
esso
for
storing
government
owned
gasoline,
that
perhaps
if
it
were
measured
by
gallons
or
something
of
that
sort,
it
would
be
a
different
picture
and
wouldn't
look
like
a
tax
on
the
property.
but
how
can
it
be
done?
acres
is
the
only
thing
that
might
come
to
mind
as
being
some
standard
of
that
sort
but
how
would
acres
apply
to
3.5
acres
upon
which
this
$8
million
plant
rests
in
muskegon
county,
why
a
tax
of
$10,000
per
acre
clearly
would
be
reasonable?
but
there
is
for
instance
say
20
acre
tract
adjoining
that's
used
as
nothing
but
a
testing
ground,
which
is
virtually
vacant
land,
that
land
wouldn't
be
worth
$200
an
acre.
and
below
that
is
a
3
acre
parcel
used
to
dump
waste
that's
not
worth
$10
an
acre,
certainly
you
cannot
arrive
at
a
fair
and
just
tax
on
any
other
basis
than
--
the
measure
that
the
state
of
michigan
sought
it
to
imply
here.
counsel's
reply
brief
is
directed
at
two
things,
the
military
leasing
act
and
the
other.
he
has
repeated
over
and
over
again
that
the
uses
included
in
the
privilege
i
mean
rather
that
the
uses
included
in
the
lease,
the
privilege
of
uses
included
in
the
lease
whether
the
lease
be
one
year,
five
years
or
ten,
the
privilege
of
use
is
also
included
in
ownership
you
want
to
keep
in
mind
and
it
has
been
held
that
we
can
segregate
the
faggots
and
attach
them
separately.
the
burden
of
the
argument
there
is
that
since
the
privilege
of
use
is
necessarily
included
within
a
lease
or
even
ownership,
it
can
never
be
taxed
up
to
the
same
amount
as
a
tax
that
might
be
imposed
because
of
ownership
or
because
of
leasehold
interest
viewing
it
as
a
property
right.
now
that
simply
is
not
the
case.
in
fact
it
maybe
taxed
far
in
excess
of
that
amount.
just
look
at
the
gasoline
stored
by
esso
standard
oil
for
which
they
paid
$0.06
a
gallon
for
the
privilege
of
storage.
now
if
esso
had
owned
that
gasoline
themselves
and
had
it
in
their
own
tanks,
they
wouldn't
have
been
subject
to
the
tax
because
they
would
not
have
been
engaged
in
the
business
of
storing
gasoline.
they
would
have
paid
the
regular
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
by
virtue
of
their
ownership
at
the
end
of
the
year.
what
would
it
have
amounted
to,
possibly
10,
15
mills.
six
mills
on
gasoline
worth
possibly
$0.30
or
0.35
a
gallon,
it's
somewhere
around
a
150
mills.
now
a
man
who
owns
furs
and
has
them
in
a
warehouse
will
pay
an
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
of
a
few
mills
on
it
each
year.
what
if
he
elects
to
exercise
his
privilege
which
is
included
in
his
privilege
of
ownership
of
sale
during
a
year,
immediately
a
sales
tax
in
michigan
of
3%
or
30
mills
is
imposed.
and
his
troubles
are
only
beginning
because
the
federal
government
then
imposes
a
10%
tax
which
is
a
100
mills
because
he
exercised
his
privilege
of
sale
which
is
included
within
his
ownership,
so
that
the
tax
upon
a
privilege
may
far
exceed
any
tax
that
can
be
imposed
because
of
ownership
alone.
in
this
instance
it's
merely
made
equal.
the
interesting
part
to
me
about
this
long
reference
to
the
military
leasing
act
lies
in
the
debate
that
it
is
recognized
that
a
serious
injustice
and
inequality
exists.
the
long
years
of
debate
that
had
gone
on
in
the
senate
and
in
congress
results
really
in
nothing.
we've
labeled
a
mountain
and
come
up
with
a
mole
hill
here.
they
all
say
it's
a
serious
problem.
it's
unjust.
something
ought
to
be
done,
but
what
should
be
done?
what
can
we
do
that
will
bring
about
a
fair
and
just
solution?
the
inference
is
they
have
virtually
given
up
except
for
one
thing
they're
going
to
resort
to
a
federal
dole
in
the
payments,
in
what
they
call
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes.
now
some
reference
has
been
made
to
the
fact
that
the
school
district
i
represent
has
been
forced
to
accept
some
of
those.
it's
immaterial
here.
it
did
not
apply
in
the
year
1940
–
'54
and
it
did
not
receive
any
for
that
year.
there
has
been
a
temporary
act
passed
since
which
expires
in
'58
which
for
hire
purposes
will
expire
next
year
because
hire
tax
for
'57
isn't
payable
until
'58.
we
may
have
one
more
year
under
that
act
but
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
extended
or
not.
i
think
we'll
all
agree
that
this
federal
dole
is
certainly
an
unsatisfactory
solution
in
any
event.
mr.
harold
m.
street
yeah,
it's
general,
quite
broad
in
its
scope
at
least
it
covers
the
continental
plant.
mr.
harold
m.
street
at
least
it
covers
the
continental
plant.
mr.
harold
m.
street
in
this
particular
act,
as
i
recall,
it's
land
that
formally
belonged
to
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
and
then
fell
into
government
hand
–-
mr.
harold
m.
street
this
particular
act,
as
i
recall
it,
it
applies
in
hire
case,
there
are
other
acts
that
do
apply
but
they
don't
apply
in
all
instances
such
as
here
in
'54
there
was
no
applicable
act.
your
honors
–-
mr.
harold
m.
street
i
only
suppose
–
i
know
there's
military
leasing
act
and
that
of
course
would
catch
a
small
tax
with
a
lease
of
one
year
or
returnable
at
will
and
so
on.
the
point
i
want
to
make
here
–
well
here
was
the
main
problem,
as
i
had
pointed
out,
you'll
notice
in
senate
debate.
one
senator
said,
“well
let's
transfer
title
over
to
these
people
and
with
a
recapture
clause,
that
will
make
it
taxable
and
that
will
solve
our
problem.”
someone
pointed
out
the
situation
and
it
was
referred
to
here.
the
government
may
want
to
reserve
a
large
part
of
that
plant
for
storage
and
on
the
lease
we'll
say
a
third.
well
the
lessee
if
he
is
going
to
get
taxed
on
the
whole
property,
will
like
that.
act
189
takes
care
of
that,
it's
only
the
property
actually
used,
that's
made
available
to
and
actually
used.
now
there
was
inference
made
that
perhaps
in
the
borg-warner
case,
space
used
for
storage
was
included
in
the
assessment.
if
so
it
was
by
error
and
could
have
been
corrected,
had
it
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
assessing
officers
i'm
sure
because
that
portion
of
the
plant
would
not
be
used.
another
problem
what
confronted
them,
what
we
might
refer
to
as
white
elephant
plant.
here
is
a
big
plant
that
costs
millions
of
dollars
to
bill,
we
want
it
as
a
standby
facility,
it
does
not
have
too
much
value
for
commercial
use
and
yet
if
we
transfer
title
over,
it
will
be
taxable
value.
that's
taken
care
of
too
in
this
sort
of
situation.
let's
look
at
continental
plant
a
value
of
$8
million
cost.
it's
on
the
assessment
rolls
at
3
million.
our
assessor
recognizes
and
must
assess
property
in
the
state
michigan
on
the
basis
of
its
present
market
value
what
it
will
bring
on
the
market
today,
which
equalizes
something
and
copes
with
the
problem
that
i
say
cannot
be
solved
on
a
federal
level.
now
the
whole
attitude
seems
to
have
been
here
by
opposing
counsel
will
have
--
the
united
states
congress
has
coped
with
this
matter
for
a
great
many
years
and
has
not
received
a
–
obtained
a
solution
which
they
might
do
sometime
in
the
future
but
in
the
meantime
let's
get
along
with
this
dole
or
something
we
have
done
everything
that
can
be
done.
now
with
all
due
respect
to
the
united
states
congress
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
a
monopoly
on
wisdom.
i
think
there's
a
little
residual
of
wisdom
left
in
the
michigan
state
legislature.
and
instead
of
debating
on
ad
infinitum,
the
michigan
legislature
has
done
something
and
the
unique
part
of
it
here
is
no
one
comes
here
and
says
that
this
act
is
unfair
to
the
united
states
government,
that
it's
unfair
to
continental
motors
or
to
borg-warner
or
that
it
is
unfair
to
anyone
else.
most
of
the
lower
courts
commented
on
the
inherent
justice
and
desirability
of
the
act
and
no
one
has
pointed
out
in
any
inherent
evil.
some
comment
has
been
made
that
the
act
is
a
little
inartistic
and
not
sophisticated.
i
think
that's
one
of
its
best
merits.
it's
a
very
simple
act.
we
make
use
of
existing
machinery
that's
already
in
operation.
we
don't
have
to
set
up
a
bureau
with
a
lot
of
new
elaborate
employees
to
administer
this
act.
it's
simple
in
its
operation,
it's
clear,
it's
understand
–
and
it's
equitable
in
its
operation.
your
honor
all
we
ask
is
this
court
consider
that
in
view
of
the
reply
brief,
the
action
taken
there,
that
it's
entirely
possible
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
michigan
in
using
this
residue
of
wisdom
that's
left
to
them
have
solved
a
problem,
at
least
on
a
local
level,
which
i
submit
cannot
be
solved
on
a
federal
level.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
harold
m.
street
this
one
slipped
on
the
real
property
roll.
mr.
harold
m.
street
this
one
got
on
the
real
property
roll.
it
was
pointed
this
was
a
new
act,
the
assessors
didn't
know
just
what
to
do
with
it.
in
our
township
this
property
had
been
carried
on
the
assessment
roll
right
along
you
see
until
it
was
ultimately
declared
surplus
and
went
through
various
channels
and
then
in
1953
the
year
this
act
became
effective
went
to
the
united
states
as
such.
so
the
assessor
already
had
it
on
his
roll,
so
he
simply
went
ahead
and
made
an
assessed
value
and
set
it
down
in
this
instance
on
the
real
property
roll.
it
seems
to
me
--
i
don't
see
any
substance
to
the
difference,
technically
there
probably
should
be
a
third
roll
setup
for
this
type
of
property
i
believe.
mr.
harold
m.
street
this
act
does
not
apply
to
personal
property
here.
mr.
harold
m.
street
it's
the
mechanics,
the
way
it's
done
in
michigan
is
the
assessor
goes
out
and
he
evaluates
all
the
property.
mr.
harold
m.
street
real
or
personal,
yes
and
then
finds
out
what
the
school
must,
the
county
must
have
and
so
on
and
then
it
decides
what
millage
must
be
applied
to
that
valuation
to
produce
the
amount
of
money
needed,
that's
the
mechanics
of
it.
mr.
harold
m.
street
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
m.
street
we
lump
them
all
together,
yes.
mr.
harold
m.
street
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
m.
street
not
applied
(inaudible)
to
go
on
the
third
tax
rule,
it
all
comes
out
the
same
place,
yes.
mr.
harold
m.
street
one,
where
the
difficulty
is
pointed
out,
about
the
only
way
it
could
be
done
on
a
federal
level
would
be
to
transfer
this
title
back
with
a
recapture
clause.
mr.
harold
m.
street
if
they
said
that
--
well
you
would
get
the
same
result
though.
then
you
would
be
--
you
will
say
de-immunizing
all
of
these
plants.
in
some
instances
--
mr.
harold
m.
street
oh
it
could,
but
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
satisfactory
--
mr.
harold
m.
street
well
if
these
difficulties
like
your
white
elephant
plants
that
they
fear
or
a
plant
where
the
government
wants
to
retain
portions
of
it,
well
say
for
storage
and
future
use.
if
they
de-immunize
the
whole
thing
so
to
speak
it
all
becomes
taxable,
which
maybe
unjust
to
the
federal
government
in
certain
ways.
mr.
harold
m.
street
it's
possible
if
they
would
say
used
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
profit
such
portions.
if
it
could
--
federal
government
adopted
in
substance
189
they
might
solve
it
your
honor
on
the
same
level.
thank
you.
