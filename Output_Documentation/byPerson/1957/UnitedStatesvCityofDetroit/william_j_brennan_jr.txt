justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
in
the
--
practical
effect
is
that
if
this
tax
has
to
be
paid
by
someone,
the
lessee
is
not
going
to
pay
as
much
rent
as
otherwise
united
states
could
get
him
to
pay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
aren't
there
other
considerations
mr.
fisher
besides
the
rent
that
these
lessees
will
pay
which
determines
whether
or
not
the
government
will
lease
to
a
given
lessee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
is
not
â€“
this
is
--
this
doesn't
optimize
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
not
thinking
of
that.
i
mean
the
choice
of
a
lessee
for
one
of
these
government
owned
arsenals
or
whatever
they
maybe
is
dictated
by
considerations
that
is
more
important
than
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
problem
of
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
amount
of
the
rent
that
the
lessee
will
pay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
a
substantial
item
but
in
the
choice
of
lessee
is
it
a
significant
consideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fisher
if
that
was
so
would
the
value
of
that
interest
be
a
constant
over
the
period
of
the
lease?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
mean
probably
it'd
be
of
greater
value
at
the
first
year
then
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
(inaudible)
doesn't
help
the
municipality
in
anyway
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
o'connor
what's
the
rate
that's
supplied,
is
it
the
local
detroit
rate,
tax
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
arrived
at
by
including
in
the
ratables
the
values
of
these
properties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
private
property
pay
a
real
estate
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
far
as
detroit
is
concerned,
detroit
gets
no
real
estate
tax
from
the
lessee
though,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
mean
a
private,
a
lessee
of
private
property
(inaudible)
no
real
estate
tax
for
the
city
of
detroit,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
as
far
municipal
revenues
are
concerned,
raised
by
taxes,
no
part
of
those
revenues
are
contributed
by
lessees
of
private
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
owner
of
the
property
i
take
it
pays
the
real
estate
taxes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
it's
from
him
and
to
him
that
detroit
looks
for
the
payment
of
the
taxes
on
that
profit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
thing
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
practical
matter
you
told
me
that
the
values
of
these
publically
owned
properties
where
they
are
leased
enter
into
the
general
ratables
upon
--
which
formed
the
base
from
which
the
tax
rate
is
computed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
practical
effect
of
this
is
that
the
lessee
of
this
publically
owned
property
does
pay
the
real
estate
tax
upon
that
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
the
words
you
use,
but
the
practical
effect
of
it
is
that
he
is
paying
the
taxes
on
the
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
ratables
of
the
values
of
property
goes
into
ratables
and
the
tax
rate
is
struck
on
ratables
which
include
the
value
for
those
properties,
why
isn't
he
paying
the
real
estate
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
deciding
to
take
any
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
all
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
no
(inaudible)
enter
into
regularly
the
assessment
phase
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
and
i
gather
that
given
(inaudible)
lease,
let's
say
for
a
20-year
lease
the
tax
(inaudible)
the
city
tax
rate
(inaudible)
$1000000,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
another
20-year
lease
on
that
property
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
another
way
of
getting
out
mr.
o'connor
let's
take
the
first
one,
this
borg-warner,
if
borg-warner
owned
that
property
instead
of
leasing
it,
but
actually
owned
it,
it
would
have
an
assessment
as
the
owner
of
$352,060,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
would
have
a
tax
bill
at
the
tax
rate
against
the
$352,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
tax
bill
would
be
a
real
estate
tax
bill
wouldn't
it,
if
it
owned
the
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
am
--
assuming
a
different
case,
assuming
it
owned
the
property,
not
leased
it
but
owned
it,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
get
a
real
estate
tax
bill
and
an
assessment
of
$352,000
at
the
local
rate,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
because
it's
the
lessee
of
the
property
it
gets
what,
a
different
kind
of
tax
bill,
a
different
color
maybe
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah
so
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
gets,
it
gets
a
--
whatever
it
maybe
called
it's
still
a
tax
bill
and
then
the
assessment
of
$352,060
at
the
local
rates
for
1954.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
street.
i
gather
in
striking
the
tax
rate,
you
aggregate
both
real
property
assessments
and
personal
property
tax
assessments,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
no,
i'm
speaking
generally.
in
striking
the
local
tax
rate,
you
have
a
uniform
rate
that
applies
both
to
real
estate
assessments
and
personal
property
tax
assessments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
real
or
personal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
you
have
the
same
rate,
the
consequence
is
you
get
the
same
rate,
whether
the
tax
is
on
personal
property
or
on
real
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
same
rate
and
then
arriving
at
the
rate
you
aggregate
the
assessments
against
real
property
and
the
assessments
against
personal
property
all
together.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
wipe
the
rates
from
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
practically
make
any
difference
whether
this
assessment
is
listed
on
a
personal
property
tax
roll
or
real
estate
tax
roll
or
otherwise,
does
it?
