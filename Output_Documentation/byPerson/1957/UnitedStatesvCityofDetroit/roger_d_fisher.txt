mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
these
cases,
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
michigan,
involved
the
validity
of
a
michigan
statute
which
explicitly
imposes
a
special
tax
on
the
lessees
and
users
of
tax
exempt
property.
you
have
three
numbers,
three
cases
here,
number
26,
to
the
united
states
and
borg-warner
against
detroit
involves
a
defense
plant
which
is
owned
by
the
united
states
and
detroit
and
leased
to
borg-warner.
number
37,
number
38
are
separate
appeals
by
the
united
states
and
by
continental
motors
involving
a
defense
plant
in
muskegon,
michigan
which
is
owned
by
the
united
states
and
occupied
and
used
by
the
continental
motors
corporation.
although
three
cases
are
here
consolidated
for
argument,
you
have
only
two,
in
substance
two
cases,
the
muskegon
case
and
the
detroit
case
that
is
the
continental
case
in
muskegon
and
the
borg-warner
case
in
detroit.
unlike
the
case
we
just
were
arguing,
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
ownership
of
this
property
or
who
owns
it
or
what
title
means.
again
unlike
the
(inaudible)
case,
this
is
not
a
general
tax
levied
on
everybody
equally
in
michigan.
the
facts
of
the
two
cases
are
sufficiently
different,
so
we
will
have
to
state
them
separately.
the
plant
in
detroit
is
a
naval
industrial
reserve
plant
owned
by
the
united
states
for
a
number
of
years.
in
1947,
in
the
military
leasing
act,
congress
authorized
long-term
leases
on
defense
plants
which
should
be
available
on
a
standby
basis
which
were
not
currently
needed
for
defense
production.
under
a
negotiated
lease
effective
in
1948,
dated
1950,
this
plant
was
leased
to
the
borg-warner
corporation
for
five
years,
and
options
on
their
part
to
extend
for
three
additional
terms
and
five
years
each.
the
lease
was
revived
and
extended
in
1958,
until
1958
and
1953
effective
till
1958.
under
the
lease,
borg-warner
leases
the
bulk,
almost
all
of
plant.
this
includes
a
storage
area
in
which
all
the
machine
tools
owned
by
the
united
states
in
the
plant
are
stored
and
a
manufacturing
area
in
which
borg-warner
uses
for
its
own
private
commercial
purposes
unconnected
with
national
defense.
borg-warner
has
a
duty
to
maintain
the
storage
area
and
to
oil
and
grease
and
make
sure
the
equipment
there
is
in
an
operating,
usable
condition
and
upon
termination
of
the
lease
borg-warner
must
reinstall
all
the
machine
tools
back
to
their
places
in
the
manufacturing
area
and
throughout
the
plant.
the
lease
is
subject
to
cancellation
upon
declaration
of
a
national
emergency
by
the
president
or
upon
120
days
notice
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
the
interest
of
national
defense.
in
1953,
michigan
adopted
public
act
number
189,
an
act
to
provide
for
the
taxation
of
lessees
and
users
of
tax
exempt
property.
as
of
january
1,
1954,
detroit
assessed
the
tax
against
borg-warner
under
this
act.
the
board
of
assessors
valued
the
property
precisely
as
it
would
have
done
had
such
real
property
been
owned
in
free
simple
and
occupied
by
borg-warner
corporation.
that
is
the
stipulation.
they
assessed
this
just
as
a
real
property
tax
assessment.
property
was
assessed
at
some
$350,000
and
the
tax
was
something
over
$12,000
was
imposed.
borg-warner
paid
the
tax
under
protest
and
on
september
1954,
the
united
states
and
borg-warner
together
joined
in
bringing
suit
as
plaintiffs
for
a
refund
of
the
tax.
at
the
time
of
the
renewal
of
the
lease,
effective
1953
which
was
actually
negotiated
in
1954,
the
lease
included
a
provision
that
united
sates
would
be
responsible
for
this
tax
if
it
were
valid,
but
that
it
would
be
contested
and
borg-warner
would
cooperate
in
contesting
the
validity
of
the
tax,
full
burden
of
the
tax
if
imposed
or
if
recovered
in
this
case,
it
subsequently
felt
benefits
or
hurts
the
united
state.
in
the
lower
--
it
was
alleged
that
act
189
was
repugnant
to
the
constitution
and
that
authorized
taxation
of
property
owned
by
the
united
states.
both
the
circuit
court
of
wayne
county
and
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
upheld
the
statute.
supreme
court
of
michigan
stated
the
tax
was
not
a
tax
on
the
property
nor
on
the
leasehold
interest,
but
and
i
quote
“a
specific
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
the
property.”
united
states
and
borg-warner
both
appealed
to
this
court,
which
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
numbers
37
and
38
involving
the
defense
plant
in
muskegon
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
at
the
time
when
the
first
lease
was
negotiated,
it
was
assumed
the
taxed
property
was
not
taxable
and
that
there
would
be
no
tax
equivalent
to
the
real
estate
taxes
imposed.
the
lease
was
negotiated
on
that
terms.
at
each
five-year
interval
the
terms
of
lease
are
subject
to
renegotiation.
when
the
first
five
years
was
over,
which
occurred
in
1953,
and
negotiated
from
1953
to
1954
and
adopted
the
definitive
terms,
in
the
renegotiation
of
the
lease
rather
than
raise
their
--
lower
their
rent
because
they
were
having
a
burden
of
a
tax
or
speculate
on
that
because
of
the
tax,
it
was
agreed
that
the
united
states
would
--
by
contract
the
united
states
assumed
full
burden
of
this
tax
in
order
to
get
the
lease
terms
as
satisfactory
to
the
united
states
as
they
were.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
not
as
matter
of
law,
no,
except
in
this
case
there
was
a
contract
outstanding
with
the
united
states
(inaudible),
it
will
pay
the
tax
under
the
period
of
the
lease,
i
thought
your
honor
would
like
to
note,
this
was
the
--
i
assume
you
would,
that
this
is
the
fact
situation
here
and
as
a
practical
matter
if
a
lease
that
the
lessee
of
property
must
pay
a
tax,
the
amount
that
is
paid
for
the
lease
is
substantially
than
the
lessee
need
not
pay
a
tax.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
i
am
not
to
saying
that
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
paying
this
tax
means
this
is
the
tax
upon
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
by
contract
borg-warner
does
not
have
to
pay
this
tax,
the
burden
is
passed
on
to
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
i
understood
your
question
correctly
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
let's
see
if
i
stated
--
the
united
sates
owned
this
plant.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
there
was
no
interest
in
anyone
else
except
the
united
states
and
the
naval
reserve
plant
in
detroit.
it
was
every
interest
within
the
united
states.
at
that
point
the
united
states
leased
out
to
borg-warner,
let
them
use
the
plant.
the
contention
of
michigan
is
they
may
now
impose
a
tax
on
that
privilege
of
using
the
government
plant,
the
tax
exempt
plant.
that
--
we
contend
that
this
tax
is
a
substantive
tax
on
the
plant
and
that
it
is
not
permitted
either
under
the
implied
immunity
or
under
congressional
action
in
this
field.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right
and
i
believe
the
situation
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
borg-warner
were
required
to
pay
the
tax
by
the
contract.
we
are
not
contending
that
that
makes
any
difference
in
the
imposition
of
the
tax.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
the
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
your
honor
i
believe
that
that
the
--
whether
by
contract
or
indirectly
the
burden
of
such
arrangement
is
going
to
be
reflected
in
united
states,
here
it's
reflected
directly.
the
continental
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
agree
--
i
accept
that
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
are
number
of
considerations
and
this
is
one.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well
the
tax
on
the
continental
property
is
around
$900,000.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
than
the
local
taxes.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
rent
sometimes
becomes
significant,
fairly
substantial
item.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
i
don't
believe
it,
i
do
not.
the
critical
difference
between
the
continental
case
in
muskegon
and
the
borg-warner
case
is
that
continental
has
no
lease.
continental
is
there
under
a
facilities
procurement
type
contract,
which
we
provide
the
complete
plant.
continental
makes
defense
goods
in
that
plant
for
the
united
states.
it
is
not,
its
occupancy
is
not
under
--
not
governed
by
the
military
leasing
act
of
1947.
everything
it
manufactures
in
the
plant
is
for
the
united
states.
it
is
doing
the
government's
business
on
the
government's
property
for
a
contract
price,
making
goods.
in
that
cost
basis,
it
cannot
reflect
any
element
of
cost
that
comes
from
the
plant
or
the
equipment
supplied
by
the
government.
here
again
the
property
was
valued
precisely
as
it
would
have
been,
as
the
property
was
owned
in
fee
simple
occupied
by
continental
motors.
the
rates
for
real
property
taxes
in
muskegon
took
into
account
the
assessment
on
this
and
determined
tax
rate
would
be.
it
was
treated
as
a
real
property
tax.
in
the
computation
of
the
tax,
the
tax
--
it
was
carried
on
the
same
real
property
tax
roll.
the
tax
bill
sent
out
was
identical
to
that
sent
to
real
property
owners.
continental
did
not
pay
the
tax.
a
suit
was
brought
by
the
township
of
muskegon,
the
county
of
muskegon
and
the
local
school
district.
united
states
intervened
as
the
party
defendant.
both
the
county
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
entered
judgment
for
the
municipal
corporations.
the
government's
position
is
very
clear.
the
michigan's
act
189
impinges
upon
the
implied
immunity
of
united
states
property
and
state
taxation,
which
exists
in
the
absence
of
congressional
acts
in
the
field.
both
because
it
is
a
--
in
substance
purpose
and
affects
a
tax
on
the
real
property,
the
value
of
the
real
property
and
because
it
is
designed
as
compensatory
or
retaliatory
tax
directed
solely
at
tax
exempt
property.
we
think
under
the
implied
immunity
it
is
there
on
both
of
too
grounds.
our
second
argument,
it
stems
from
the
fact
that
congress
has
legislated
in
this
field.
the
military
leasing
act
which
specifically
applies
to
borg-warner
plant
provides
that
the
lessee's
interest
shall
be
made
subject
to
taxation.
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
considered
by
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
to
know
more
in
the
value
of
the
leasehold
interest
through
the
subject
of
tax
for
leases
made
under
the
military
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
statute
does
not
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
justice
frankfurter
the
statute
by
it
terms
does
not
apply
to
the
continental
plant.
the
--
there
they
will
have
no
lease
whatsoever.
there
it's
a
procurement
contract
under
procurement
authority
of
the
united
states
that
makes
available
the
plant
to
them
and
it's
tamable
at
will
as
soon
as
they
stop
making
supply
for
the
united
states,
as
soon
as
united
states
which
has
the
option
to
cancel
that
contract,
they
are
out,
they
can
be
put
out
the
next
day.
and
this
is
why
i
direct
my
argument
first
that
the
implied
immunity
which
we
believe
covers
both
cases
very
clearly,
and
secondly
the
legislation
which
specifically
applied
in
one
case
in
which
we
think
reflect
a
policy
that
it's
applicable
to
the
second
case.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
tax
is
in
substance
a
tax
on
property
of
the
united
states.
the
act
which
appears
in
our
brief
for
appellants
on
page
29
is
entitled
“an
act
to
provide
for
the
taxation
of
lessees
and
users
of
tax
exempt
property.”
and
any
real
property,
which
for
any
reason
is
exempt
from
taxation
is
leased
et
cetera
are
made
available
and
used
by
private
individual
or
corporation,
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
property,
then
they
have
exception
which
is
unimportant
then
it
says
‘shall
be
subject.'
unfortunately
in
the
drafting
of
this
legislative
history
of
this
act
the
predicate
to
‘shall
be
subject'
was
left
out.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
has
told
us
what
should
be
there
and
it
should
--
you
should
read
as
inserted
in
there
the
lessee
or
user
of
such
property
shall
be
subject
to
taxation
in
the
same
amount
and
to
the
same
extent
as
though
the
lessee
or
user
or
the
owner
of
such
property.
and
the
second
section
provides
with
or
--
i
should
go
on
provide
explicitly
before
going
shall
not
apply
to
federal
property
for
which
payments
are
made
in
lieu
of
taxes
in
amounts
equivalent
to
taxes,
which
might
otherwise
be
lawfully
assessed.
section
two
provide
the
taxes
to
be
assessed
with
such
lessees
and
users
and
collect
in
the
same
manner
as
the
real
estate
taxes
except
they
shall
not
become
a
lien
on
the
property.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
congress
has
in
a
large
number
of
cases
specifically
authorized
legislation
making
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes.
as
to
this
particular
plant
in
continental,
congress
has
authorized
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
since
this
case
started,
there's
legislation
referred
to
in
both
decrees
delaying
with
it.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
congress
says
we
will
make
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
and
they
will
be
worked
out
in
the
following
fashion.
this
--
the
statute
which
i
referred,
public
law
388,
only
applied
to
plants
that
were
taken
from
the
rfc
to
united
states
or
to
some
branch
of
united
states
which
would
make
it
tax
exempt.
the
continental
plant
now
operated
by
continental
in
muskegon
was
held
by
the
rfc.
it
was
taxable.
they
were
receiving
tax
payments
from
it.
it
was
conveyed
in
liquidation
of
the
rfc
was
conveyed
to
the
united
states,
just
remove
it
from
the
tax
rolls,
one
year
later
congress
got
around
and
said
to
make
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
while
considering
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
we
have
listed
legislation
effect
on
various
types
of
payments
in
the
appendix,
showing
all
existing
legislation
as
of
this
tax
day,
various
types
of
payments
which
congress
was
authorizing.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
certainly
do
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
is
a
field
in
which
congress
has
repeatedly
legislated,
dealt
with
the
very
plant
here
involved
that
is
provided
for
payment
for
education,
the
school
district
which
is
here
as
a
plaintiff
has
received
payments
as
federal
aid
to
impacted
area
that
is
calculated
by
the
number
of
children
of
parents
working
in
the
plant
receive
a
certain
percentage
of
aid
not
in
the
year
in
question,
but
the
years
before
and
years
of
the
annual
reports
of
the
commissioner
of
education
indicate.
this
tax
is
a,
the
assessment
procedure
the
computation
of
the
tax--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
congress
has
the
authority
where
it
sees
fit
to
extend
the
immunity
to
contractors
as
this
court
held
in
carson
against
roane-anderson
where
contractors
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
are
made
exempt
from
use
tax
in
tennessee
because
of
--
by
congress'
statute
said
so
and
necessary
and
proper
clause
of
authorized
functions.
congress
can
waive
the
tax.
congress
has
for
a
hundred
years
and
particularly
in
the
last
10
years
given
extreme
consideration
to
this
particular
problem,
assuming
that
defense
plants
owned
by
united
states,
the
value
of
those
plants
cannot
be
taxed.
they
have
--
it's
a
very
difficult
problem
in
which
it's
hard
to
appraise
the
equities.
sometimes
the
plant
is
setup
in
nowhere
a
community
goes
around
it,
which
grew
its
benefit
from
the
plant,
they
then
say
we
want
to
tax
the
whole
atomic
energy
installation
here,
now
we
have
village,
we're
assessing
the
tax,
we
think
we
ought
to
collect
revenue.
that
case
is
quite
different
than
the
case
here
in
muskegon
where
there
was
a
plant
on
tax
rolls
which
comprised
half
the
school
district
here
involved,
assessed
value
or
something
of
that
kind,
which
was
taken
off
the
rolls,
in
that
case
congress
has
legislated
providing
that
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
shall
be
made
to
the
continental
motors
corporations,
it
was
included
in
the
list
of
plants
covered
by
this
provision
and
until
1959
and
they
now
have
other
legislation
pending
and
in
the
works
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
a
broader
way.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
are
trying
to
find
legislation
dealing
with
them
in
a
general
way,
the
answer
that
most
bills
come
to
is
you
have
to
have
some
administrative
discretion
to
decide
on
ad
hoc
cases
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
--
i
agree
your
honor
and
we
have
in
the
back
of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
called
attention
to
the
particular
consideration
which
congress
has
given
this
in
the
last
five
congresses.
over
100
bills
were
introduced
on
it.
there
are
elaborate
reports
considering
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes,
profit
sharing,
cost
sharing,
revenue
sharing,
devices
of
every
kind.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
your
honor
there
are.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
your
honor
if
you
look
at
the
reports
which
went
with
these
bills
for
the
in
lieu
payments
that
are
interim
nature
that
were
adopted,
you
will
see
that
was
not
the
conclusion
which
was
motivating
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yeah
i
believe
[laughter].
if
your
honor
if
i
may
say,
the
congress
in
respect
for
this
decisions
of
this
court
recognized
that
it
has
the
power
to
grant
or
waive
tax
immunity
in
this
field.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
your
honor
there
is
very
clear
legislative
history
establishing
that
beyond
for
a
venture.
printed
in
appendix
a
to
our
reply
brief
is
the
discussion
in
the
senate,
first
in
the
house,
this
is
in
the
senate
committee,
appendix
a
considering
the
military
leasing
act
at
1947.
we
have
reprinted
the
entire
committee
colloquy
on
this
point
for
the
use
of
the
courts
that
i
will
not
be
--
might
i
fear
taken
out
of
context,
it's
fairly
--
there
are
ten
pages
of
discussion.
this
first
statement
which
is
the
first
time
they
refer
to
this
problem
is
senator
byrd
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
on
page
26
of
my
reply
brief
in
26,
37
and
38.
on
page
26,
senator
byrd,
“i'd
like
to
ask
about
section
6
in
regard
to
taxation.
does
this
mean
that
if
this
property
is
taxed
by
the
state
and
local
governments
it
would
have
to
be
by
an
act
of
congress?”
mr.
kenney,
“it
would
sir”
and
it
goes
on
and
on
and
mr.
--
senator
byrd,
“this
is
no
authorization.”
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
he
was
assistant
secretory
of
the
navy.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yeah
john
kenney
who
was
testifying
before
the
administration
in
presenting
the
bill.
senate
--
to
page
27
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
if
i
may
carry
your
honors
along
with
me
through
this
discussion
of
senate
committee,
mr.
kenney
said
at
the
bottom
of
page
27,
“well
we
do
under
this
bill
in
no
way
increases
or
decreases
the
amount
of
taxes
to
which
these
properties
maybe
subject
to,”
pointing
out
they
were
in
the
united
states
and
were
not
taxable
at
that
time.
senator
baldwin
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
middle,
lower
middle
of
the
page,
posed,
“what
would
you
think
about
language
providing
that
property
leased
to
private
persons,
corporate
or
individuals
pursuant
to
this
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
subject
to
state
and
local
taxation
in
accordance
with
such
state
and
tax
law,
would
that
answer
your
question”
and
then
mr.
royale
on
page
30
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
right,
both
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
in
the
next
colloquy
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes
it
does
your
honor.
both
of
them
thought
it
to
be
desirable
and
both
of
them
thought
this
would
not
impossible
without
further
legislation.
they
decided
not
to
put
that
legislation
in
this
act,
the
next
colloquy,
the
next
two
sentences,
senator
byrd
says,
“can
you
do
that
legally
if
the
title
is
vested
in
the
government
itself.”
mr.
kenny,
“you
can
do
it
only
if
congress
so
authorizes.”
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
true.
the
drafting
of
the
sentence
which
appears
at
the
first
sentence
of
section
6
of
the
military
leasing
act,
took
place
in
the
committee
in
the
open
hearings,
pages
35
and
36
of
our
brief,
and
there
were
some
suggestion
that
there
is
no
reason
to
do
this
because
they
can
do
it
already.
senator
tydings
on
page
35,
“as
a
matter
of
fact
if
the
government
leases
to
corporation
ab
a
plant
for
a
period
of
five
years
without
us
doing
anything
about
it,
they
would
be
taxable
by
each
community
of
america,
the
tax
of
leasehold
property,
so
why
put
anything
in?”
mr.
kenney,
“i
do
not
think
you
should
anything
in
this
bill.”
senator
tydings,
so
forth,
they
then
went
on
and
decided
that
there
ought
to
be
something
added
to
that,
and
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
senator
tydings,
near
the
top
of
page
36
on
my
brief.
senator
hill,
“something
ought
to
going
on
there,”
as
it
is
now
which
you
have
the
second
sentence
of
section
6
was
all
he
had.
all
you
do
is
say
in
the
event,
the
state
does
come
along
and
tax
one
of
these
lessees
you
renegotiate
the
contract
and
so
forth
and
mr.
royale,
“we
would
have
to
do
that,
they
have
to
know
the
basis
on
which
they
lease
it.”
explaining
in
the
absence
of
this
(inaudible)
he
would
insist
on
a
larger
rental
and
it's
the
chairman,
“have
you
got
the
wording
in
shape,
now
(inaudible)?
this
does
not
read
very
smoothly,”
senator
tydings,
“how
would
it
be
to
say
that
the
lessee's
interest
in
property
maybe
subject
to
tax
by
a
local
authority.”
mr.
kenny,
“any
interest
of
the
lessee
created
pursuant
to
provisions
of
this
act,
maybe
subject
to
local
taxation.”
chairman,
“read
off
in
full
mr.
secretary.”
mr.
royale
reading,
the
lessee's
interest
made
or
created
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
made
subject
to
state
or
local
taxation.
in
the
face
of
the
fact
they
were
told
they
could
not
tax
anymore
than
the
lessee's
interest
under
existing
law
which
could
impose
a
lease
or
attack
on
the
valuable
lease
hold,
the
fact
that
the
bills
were
then
pending
in
congress
dealing
with
the
general
problem,
we
conclude
that
for
a
property
under
the
military
leasing
act
you
cannot
tax
more
than
the
value
of
the
leasehold
interest,
that
is
not
was
what
was
assessed
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
the
legislation
--
i
might
put
a
little
more
legislative
history
than
you
would
on
it
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
facts
are
you
are
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there's
no
doubt
about
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
you
put
financial
in
there,
i
agree.
i
think
that
any
tax
burden
is
only
a
financial
burden,
united
states
can't
by
payments
avoid
any
other
consequences
of
taxation.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no
i
know
taxes
that
--
financial
burden
is
no
enough,
so
i
don't
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
every
item
of
legislation
your
honor
that
has
been
adopted
here
by
congress
dealing
with
this
problem,
reflects
the
immensity
and
difficulty
of
drawing
a
line
between
where
the
equities
falls,
where
a
town
benefits
enormously
from
a
government
plan
and
where
it
is
hurt.
where
if
as
if
in
the
borg-warner
case
there
is
a
lot
of
government
property
leased
to
borg-warner
for
storage
against
crisis,
since
it's
in
the
lease
property
borg-warner
has
to
look
after
it
for
us.
there
would
been
no
equity
in
charging
borg-warner
a
tax
on
that
property
whereas
the
national
forests,
private
parties
are
allowed
to
use
the
national
forests,
to
cut
some
timber
off
it.
we
have
a
sharing
arrangement
that's
been
worked
out,
in
which
the
state
gets
25%
i
believe
of
the
proceeds
of
such
sales.
if
the
state
can
also
tax
a
party
for
the
privilege
of
using
the
national
forest,
measured
by
the
value
of
the
national
forest,
the
situation
is
quite
different.
i
believe
--
the
reason
that
i
think
this
is
--
legislation
indicates
this
is
not
an
area
for
judicial
reconstruction,
is
any
decision
of
this
court,
dealing
with
this
problem
would
merely
add
one
unexpected
complicating
feature
to
a
problem
with
which
congress
has
the
power
to
deal,
is
dealing
and
would
have
to
deal
even
more
comprehensively.
the
in-lieu
payments
are
not
just
for
defense
plants.
the
in-lieu
payments
that
authorize
interim
bill
and
public
law
388,
are
for
plants
which
by
virtue
of
the
transfer
from
rfc
were
taken
off
tax
rolls.
congress
recognized
a
quite
different
situation
where
they
put
a
defense
plant
out
in
nowhere
and
a
small
community
has
grown
around
it
in
and
which
proposing
a
tax
burden
on
the
value
of
the
entire
plant
for
the
benefit
of
the
small
community
which
may
or
may
not
be
providing
services
to
the
plant,
is
not
the
way
to
deal
with
the
problem.
you
should
hold
that
the
state
may
not
tax
the
property,
it
may
tax
the
privilege
of
using
the
property
measured
by
the
property.
you
would
be
making
this
problem
one
of
form
not
of
substance.
if
you
continue
to
say
that
government
property
is
immune
from
taxation
directly,
but
if
a
state
changes
ten
words,
they
don't
change
their
administrative
machinery,
they
cause
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
tax
exempt
property.
and
by
doing
that,
you
say,
oh
a
state
can,
that's
all
right
oh
this
is
a
tax
on
a
privilege,
this
is
not
a
tax
on
the
property,
it's
just
measured
by
the
property.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
i
believe
that
this
fails
to
meet
that,
this
is
not
a
privilege,
the
privilege
using
tax
exemption
property
is
not
a
privilege
like
being
a
store
of
gasoline
or
being
a
butcher
or
a
baker
or
a
candle
stick
maker.
the
privilege
of
using
federal
property
is
one
which
the
united
states
has
exclusive
and
decided
who
it
is
going
to
lease
this
property.
this
is
more
like
leslie
miller
and
arkansas
which
you
had
last
year,
where
the
privilege
of
dealing
with
the
government
is
something
which
we
confer
by
our
lease.
this
is
a
state,
this
is
not
a
general
right
which
the
state
can
say,
oh
this
is
kind
of
doing
business
cause,
using
tax
exempt
property.
first
place
it
is
a
directed
as
being
taxing
it
because
it's
not
taxable
and
we
think
than
under
the
miller
and
milwaukee
and
macallen
against
massachusetts,
two
decision
of
this
court
which
where
the
justice
holmes
in
the
milwaukee
case
said
if
the
abound
purpose
or
self
evident
operation
of
a
statute
is
to
follow
the
bonds
of
the
united
states
and
to
make
up
for
its
inability
to
reach
them
directly,
by
indirectly
achieving
the
same
result,
the
statute
must
fail,
even
if
but
for
its
purpose
or
special
operations
it
would
be
perfectly
good.
in
both
that
case
and
the
massachusetts
case
taxes
were
found,
they
looked
through
the
language
to
find
the
tax
was
really
directed
at
tax
exempt
interest,
tax
exempt
property
and
both
were
held
invalid
for
that
reason.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
we
submit
and
we
agree,
they
can
tax
the
value
of
what
he
gets.
they
can
say
we
are
taxing,
and
i
think
you
could
have
a
tax
on
the
lessee's
tax
exempt
property
measured
by
the
value
of
the
interest
which
the
lessee
has.
i
think
the
military
leasing
act
saying
that
lessee's
interest
is
taxable
is
good,
i
think
its
declaratory
of
the
implied
immunity
that
exists
in
assets
of
that
legislation,
as
congress
plainly
saw.
i
believe
that
the
borg-warner
case,
where
borg-warner
has
a
20-year
–
in
effect
a
20-year
lease
subject
to
five
years
installments,
they
now
have,
i
don't
know
12
years
still
to
run,
that's
11
years.
detroit
could
tax
the
same
way
you
would
in
a
condemnation
case,
a
recognized
judicial
concept
of
the
lessee's
interest,
the
leasehold
interest
he
has
certain
value
and
you
can
tax
it.
we
think
the
implied
immunity
of
the
legislation
you
can
tax
it,
but
if
you
say
that
because
a
man
is
using
government
property
for
the
government's
business
as
is
being
done
in
the
continental
plan,
you
can
tax
him
for
the
privilege
of
using
that
because
he
has
something
of
value.
i
believe
you
have
a
hard
time
distinguishing
taxing
secretary
mcelroy
for
the
privilege
of
using
the
pentagon
measured
by
the
value
of
the
pentagon.
continental
is
making
government
equipment
in
a
government
plant,
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
i
believe
congress
could
take
away
that
right
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
under
the
case
which
this
court
held
recently
in
the
connection
with
atomic
and
carson
against
roane-anderson
in
342
u.s.
it
specifically
held
that
congress
could
take
--
make
contractors
with
the
atomic
energy
commission,
immune
from
use
taxes
on
goods
which
they
brought
into
the
state,
and
this
court
held
that's
what
the
construction
of
the
statute
was
and
that
it
was
valid.
so
i
believe
clearly
in
the
necessary
and
proper
powers
carrying
on
legislative
function,
if
we
have
a
plant
such
as
borg-warner,
a
large
portion
of
it
merely
storing
defense
equipment,
we
may
want
to
get
a
lessee
in
there
free,
to
use
part
of
the
plant
in
exchange
for
keeping
up
our
portion
of
the
plant
and
i
think
if
we
couldn't
do
that
about
having
a
large
tax
burden,
additional
imposed,
congress
can
say
no
it's
in
connection
with
this
function,
the
lessee
is
not,
he
just
cannot
be
taxed.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
it
will
be
disturbing
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
i
may
expand
on
that
your
honor,
i
think
that
will
be
disturbing
if
you
indicated
they
could
tax
that
privilege
measured
not
by
the
value
of
the
privilege
but
by
the
value
of
the
tax
exempt
property.
whereas
i
think
that
here
where
a
tax
is
special
discriminatorily
if
i
may
say
directed
at
tax
exempt
property,
both
state
tax
exempt
to
be
sure
and
federal
tax
exempt,
but
the
thrust
of
it
is
that
federal
--
that
was
true
in
both
the
milwaukee
and
the
massachusetts
cases,
there
were
state
taxes
on
property
included
and
the
court
still
not
found
a
thing
discriminatorily
directed
impact
of
the
federal
property.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
very
--
to
be
sure
to
some
extent
to
which
form
is
important
and
if
the
statute
were
more
artfully
drawn,
you
might
have
more
difficulty
with
it
and
it
might
accomplish
almost
the
same
result,
but
i
believe
that
it
is
plain
on
its
face
that
this
is
a
real,
they
do
nothing,
they
don't
setup
new
machinery,
they
don't
setup
different
evaluation
procedures,
part
of
the
real
property
tax
system
of
michigan,
each
community
in
muskegon
is
carried
under
real
property
tax
rolls,
they
send
out
real
property
tax
bills.
they
say
act
189
has
the
authority
for
taxing.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
were
four
detroit
cases
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
detroit
tax
record
is
in
the
record
here,
show
that
under
act
189
there
were
four
properties
that
were
taxed
under
189
in
detroit.
there
was
testimony
these
were
either
federal
or
held
by
corporation
exempt
under
michigan
state
law.
it's
not
clear
which,
which
if
any.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
to
case
here
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
see
nothing
unfair
in
their
trying
to
tax
the
operator
on
what
he
has.
i
do
think
that
if
a
government
plant,
whether
it's
army
air
base,
or
whether
it's
defense
plant
is
located
in
a
town
and
imposes
a
burden
on
that
town,
i
do
think
that
you
should
not
tax
someone
who
does
not
have
something
himself
for
the
value
of
the
government
property.
i
think
as
i
suggest
here,
borg-warner
has
a
long-term
lease.
they
are
operating
for
their
own
private
business.
we
would,
admit
and
uphold
the
validity
of
any
statute
that
assessed
the
value
of
that
leasehold
interest
which
is
substantial.
in
(inaudible)
case
this
court
held
that
the
lessee
had
the
full,
lessee's
interest
with
the
full
value
of
the
buildings
there
involved
which
had
a
life
shorter
than
lease.
i
don't
know
about
how
the
machinery
here
would
work
out,
how
the
building
would
work
out.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
because
they
would
be
--
not
be
taxing
the
government's
property
because
of
the
government's
property
they
would
be
taxing
the
value
of
something
it's
non
taxable,
a
taxable
person
has
because
of
that
value.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
not
just
a
sophisticated
formula.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
of
what
the
lessee
had,
as
a
property
interest
if
it
is
a
property
tax.
in
order
to
–
they
can
have
a
privilege
tax
for
being
an
aircraft
manufacturer
in
michigan,
they
can
charge
a
privilege
tax
based
on
being
an
aircraft
manufacturer.
but
the
tax
of
privilege
tax
on
being
an
aircraft
manufacturer
on
government
tax
again
property
measured
by
the
value
of
the
government
property,
it's
just
too
much
like
taxing
a
government
property.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
same
way
it
would
be
unreasonable
tax
an
air
base
which
was
or
a
post
office
which
is
engaged
in
delivering
business,
delivering
packages
and
a
railway
express
company
engaged
in
delivering
packages,
they
are
both
doing
the
same
business
and
the
community
cannot
tax
the
post
office,
it
can
tax
railway
express.
this,
the
--you
cannot
tax
that
--
and
i
suppose
--
this
tax
is
only
on
tax
against
property.
it
cannot
impose
a
tax
on
the
property.
they
think
that,
they
think
that
this
is
not
something
of
substance,
they
think
there
is
no
--
michigan
treats
this
as
a
matter
of
simply
a
form
that
whenever
a
person
is
being
paid
and
making
a
profit
for
using
tax
exempt
property
you
can
tax
him
for
the
whole
privilege
of
that
based
on
the
full
value
of
the
property.
now
continental
is
here
at
will
making
government
property
on
--
with
government
machines
and
a
government
plant.
it
is
not
selling
anything
commercially.
we
go
over
there
costs
down
to
the
bone,
to
keep
them
as
low
as
we
can,
and
there
is,
they
cannot
reflect
any
item
of
our
machinery
in
that
cost
figure.
now
to
say
that
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
theory
this
is
a
privilege
of
using
the
government
property
equal
to
the
tax
that
they
try
to
impose
on
borg-warner
who
has
a
20
year
lease
using
industrial
plant
for
its
own
commercial
purposes,
i
think
you
are
not
taxing
property.
i
think
if
you
have
an
aircraft
manufacturer's
privilege
tax,
state
tax,
you
can
tax
that,
but
you
cannot
make
the
use
of
tax
exempt
property,
a
taxable
privilege
when
it's
all
the
lease
gives.
they
have
set
in
the
appellee's
brief
here
that
the
privilege
of
use
is
not
the
lessee's
interest.
oh
no
we
are
taxing
two
different
things.
of
course
the
military
leasing
act
might
limit
us
the
value
of
the
leasehold
interest
and
the
(inaudible)
case
i
might
say
explicitly
in
the
opinion
stated
that
under
the
military
leasing
act,
value
attributable
to
a
period
beyond
the
lessees
interest
must
be
excluded
from
the
tax
since
it
represents
the
government
ownership
interest,
that's
in
the
footnote
discussing
this
problem.
the,
they
are
not
taxing
the
lessee's
interest.
they
are
taxing
the
privilege
of
use.
but
what
is
that,
the
lease
gives
that
borg-warner
a
privilege
of
use.
the
only
privilege
of
use
he
has
is
that
defined
in
the
lease,
it's
the
same
thing.
now
there
maybe,
we
may
have
an
occasion
when
the
legal
incidence
of
tax
makes
a
difference,
but
surely
calling
the
right
which
the
lessee
has
to
the
use
plant
by
virtue
of
the
lease
calling
that
a
privilege
of
use
doesn't
make
any
difference,
it
is
the
lessee's
interest.
he
has
no
other
interest
in
that
plant
other
than
the
lease
he
gives
him,
he
has
no
other
right
to
use
it,
no
other
privilege
to
use
that
plant
other
than
the
lessee'
and
other
that
what
the
lease
gives
him
and
congress
has
said
that
under
the
military
leasing
act
the
lessee's
interest
the
value
of
it
--
clear
we
think,
the
legislative
history
has
the
value
of
that
interest,
there
is
a
limit
(inaudible)
to
tax
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
think
not,
but
i
would
say
that
a
leasehold
interest
is
something
that
is
regularly
appraised
in
condemnation
cases,
every
condemnation
case
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
the
private,
it
may
not
help
them
very
much,
in
the
congress
and
in
fact
as
the
continental
plant
they
are
currently
receiving
for
in
lieu
payment
by
act
of
congress
and
the
school
district
is
receiving
until
that
time,
they've
receiving
at
least
for
three
years
they
received
payments
based
on
the
impact
of
this
plant
on
their
school
system.
the
equities,
then
they've
decided
to
measure
the
--
congress
has
decided
to
measure
the
aids
of
the
orchard
view
school
district
by
the
number
of
children
whose
parents
work
in
the
government
plant.
orchard
view
school
district
has
decided
they
want
to
measure
that
payment
by
the
value
of
the
entire
government
plan.
i
think
when
a
conflict
comes
between
the
standard
which
congress
has
set
by
legislation
dealing
with
this
very
school
district
among
all
school
district
here,
federally
impacted
area,
i
think
that
the
congressional
standard
controls,
they
clearly
can
control.
our
basic
point
is
that
in
the
borg-warner
case
that's
covered
by
the
implied
immunity,
but
explicitly
by
the
military
leasing
act
and
that
in
the
muskegon
case
involving
continental.
the
continental
interest
which
is
at
will
(inaudible)
at
will
to
make
government
property
on
a
government
plant,
does
not
subject
the
entire
value
of
the
defense
plan
owned
by
the
united
states
there
to
a
greater
tax
than
the
muskegon,
there
is
no
greater
interest
in
continental,
they
have
a
less
of
interest
than
borg-warner
had,
and
we
believe
that
congress
in
legislating
understood
only
if
lesser
interest
could
be
taxed,
only
the
lessee
interest.
i'll
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
the
counsel
for
muskegon
mr.
street
has
just
agreed
with
us
that
the
privilege
of
use
is
one
of
the
bundles
of
rights
that
represent
a
property
right.
he
has
said
that
michigan
can
take
this
one
right
of
the
property
rights,
the
right
to
use
and
occupy,
and
they
can
tax
that
at
the
full
value
of
the
government's
property.
i
believe
in
agreeing
that
right
to
use,
privilege
of
use
is
one
of
the
property
rights,
is
the
only
property
right
that
the
lessee
has.
the
extent
of
his
right
is
measured
by
the
lease.
he
is
agreeing
that
the
lessee's
interest
and
the
privilege
of
use
are
just
the
same
thing,
not
only
in
substance,
but
analytically.
there
is
no
difference.
i
suggest
that
to
my
main
argument
that
the
privilege
of
use
of
lessee,
the
tax
against
property
are
the
lessee's
interest
which
they
have.
congress,
in
the
military
leasing
act,
said
you
can
tax
the
value
of
the
lessee's
interest.
we
believe
that
certainly
applies
in
the
borg-warner
case.
the
supreme
court,
this
court
has
for
years
gone
through
and
considered
the
ramifications
of
federal
immunity.
it
is
a
major
substantive
problem
with
which
this
court
has
wrestled
time
and
again.
in
no
case
and
here
i
refer
to
dravo,
as
well
as
the
cases
that
followed
it,
in
no
case
was
it
suggested
that
the
full
value
of
government
owned
property
is
subject
to
state
taxation,
provided
the
state
changes
the
words.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'll
a
heavier
foot
on
miller
and
milwaukee
on
that.
here
the
--
that's
not
the
only
thing,
the
measure
is
not
the
only
thing
bad
about
this
tax.
we
believe
this
tax
is
directed
aimed
at
federal
property.
now
they
went
through
and
showed
there
were
four
pieces
of
property
in
detroit
that
has
been
assessed
under
this
statute.
98%
of
the
valuation
there
listed
is
federally
owned
property.
they
have
carried
two
pieces
of
property,
one
was
$500
and
one
about
$12,000.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
doesn't
prove
sinister
purpose.
it
proves
that
the
major
substantive
effect
of
this.
now
the
statute
exempts
all
state
aided
educational
institutions.
they
can
lease
out
their
property
to
the
defense
plant
or
to
anyone
else
for
profit
and
that
lessee
is
not
taxed.
there
is
no
tax
on
him,
he
is
exempt,
he
gets
the
privilege
of
the
state,
although
he
is
working
for
profit,
everything
else,
this
tax
has
been
whittled
down
by
the
cutting
out
--
the
major
form
of
statement
exempt
institutions
which
do
these
properties,
they
educate
large
educational
institutions
and
they
--
i
think
the
statute
is
very
much
like
the
one
you
suggested
your
honor
where
they
said
the
federal
property
here,
we
will
offer
tax,
a
little
state
property,
we
get
another
little
pigeon
in
this
flock
of
ducks.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
would
change
one
aspect
of
the
problem,
it
would
remove
the
fact
that
this
is
--
we
think
it
is
directed
primarily
that
of
profit.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
that
was
relied
upon
in
the
macallen
case
explicitly
by
justice
holmes
speaking
for
the
court
saying,
certainly
that
one
can
be
--
is
the
most
conspicuous
instance
of
exemption
at
the
present
time,
that
statute
too
covered
the
state
ones
and
was
much
less
direct.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
state
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
do
not
rely
exclusively
on
that.
the
tax,
the
problem
with
which
congress
and
the
court
have
dealt
is
a
major
substantive
problem.
the
burden
on
the
locality
is
enormous,
that
burden
is
the
same
whether
it's
an
air
base,
which
has
a
lot
of
people
going
in
there,
whether
it's
a
government
run
plant
such
as
atomic
energy
plants
might
be
run
exclusively
by
government
employees
and
non-taxable,
the
burden
is
the
same
whether
a
not
for
profit
corporation
moves
in
or
whether
a
for
profit
corporation
moves
in.
now
the
weapon
which
michigan
is
trying
to
deal
with
this
substantive
problem
is
saying
that
by
changing
six
words,
ten
words,
whatever
the
left
statute
is,
by
calling
this
a
privilege
tax,
using
a
name
that
has
been
favored
as
a
different
kind
of
tax,
we
can
take
a
property
interest,
the
right
to
use
this
property,
the
lessee's
property
--
we
can
take
the
leasehold
interest
and
we
will
say
we
are
taxing
that
privilege
of
the
lessee
and
then
we,
the
whole
federal
immunity
of
government
property
is
defeated.
the
substantive
problem
is
just
really
it
turns
out
they
say,
a
matter
of
form.
for
a
100
years
we
thought
that
federal
property
is
immune,
but
it
turned
out
that
states
didn't
know
they
could
call
a
property
interest
a
--
call
a
property
interest
a
privilege
and
then
measure
the
privilege
by
the
whole
property.
in
allegheny
they
were
taxing
part
of
the
property,
the
real
estate
measured
by
the
whole
property.
this
court
explicitly
said
you
cannot
do
that.
even
if
you
can
tax
the
property
you
can
tax,
you
cannot
include
in
that
property
interest,
the
property
interest
of
the
united
states.
you
cannot
measure
the
value
of
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
the
language
of
the
court
although
not
necessarily
the
holding
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
you
are
dealing
not
with
the
leased
interest
in
the
government's
machinery
that
was
reserved,
but
real
estate
tax
in
allegheny
was
on
mesta's
plant
measured
by
--
mesta's
plant
plus
the
government
machinery.
the
court
said
the
state
has
made
no
effort
to
segregate
mesta's
interest
in
taxing.
the
full
value
of
the
property,
including
the
whole
ownership
interest
as
well
as
whatever
value
proper
appraisal
might
attribute
to
the
leasehold,
was
included
in
mesta's
assessment.
it
is
contented
the
whole
value
of
the
property
maybe
reached
since
the
impact
of
the
tax
is
upon
mesta.
we
think,
however,
that
the
government's
property
interest
are
not
taxable
either
to
it
or
to
its
bailee.
they
then
went
on
referring
to
the
fact
that
beneficial
personal
use
of
property
maybe
taxed
and
then
the
next
sentence
said
that
neither
he,
meaning
the
contractor
nor
the
government
can
be
taxed
for
the
government's
property
interest.
now
i
do
not
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
that
case
can
stand
up
if
this
statute
in
michigan
is
upheld.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
a
tax
of
10%
on
leasehold
interest
as
such
i
suppose
if
it
is
fairly
applied
across
the
board
to
lessees
of
property
and
it
appears
it
does
not
merely
meant
and
in
substance
effect
and
operation
a
way
of
getting
the
real
estate
tax.
i
think
that
the
tax
immunity
of
the
united
states
in
this
property
which
is
government
owned
is
a
matter
of
a
substance.
i
think
that
there
are
the
tax
of
all
federally
owned
property
was
subject
to
normal
tax
could
be
about
$2
billion
a
year.
if
this
were
passed
out
it
would
be
a
bonanza
to
some
communities
which
have
no
real
services
to
the
federally
owned
property
they
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well
let's
see
if
i
can
kind
of
answer
that
your
honor.
one
argument
which
is
this
tax
is
plainly
designed
to
offset
tax
immunity.
its
conceited
purpose
is
to
offset
the
tax
immunity
of
tax
exempt
property.
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
is
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
purpose
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
purpose
is
to
remove
the
tax
exemption
of
tax
exempt
properties.
i
say
that
michigan
has
full
power
to
remove
the
tax
exemption
of
property
which
it
makes
tax
exempt,
but
that
by
doing
that
it
does
not,
because
it
decides
to
remove
its
own
immunity
which
it
creates,
it
might
not
have
any
tax
immunity,
it
might
decide
not
to
have
any
local
state
laws,
because
it
decides
to
remove
its
immunity
does
not
give
it
a
privilege
of
making
an
offsetting
compensatory
tax
aimed
at
offsetting
the
federal
tax
immunity.
and
however
much
of
michigan's
tax
immunity
they
offset
or
decide
to
cancel
out
or
not
to
cancel
out,
they
are
aiming
a
portion
of
their
shot
is
solely
for
the
tax
exempt
federal
property
and
they
can
do
what
they
want
with
michigan
but
they
cannot
have
a
statute
which
grabs
federal
tax
immune
property
and
says,
we
have
now
got
a
new
formula
of
words,
it
turns
out
we
can
remove
this
property
because
it
is
tax
exempt.
we
can
tax
--
the
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
because
the
property
is
tax
exempt.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
why
they
are
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
your
honor
the
privilege
here
is
a
property
interest.
the
particular
privilege
which
they
call
a
privilege
is
not
like
being
a
corporation.
it's
not
like
engaging
in
a
business
of
storing
gasoline.
the
particular
privilege
they
have
picked
out
as
a
privilege
tax
is
one
of
the
property
interests
in
the
government
property.
it
is
--
i'll
come
back
with
the
secretary
of
defense.
it's
a
different
thing
to
tax
the
pentagon.
it
would
be
something
else
to
tax
him
for
the
privilege
of
using
the
pentagon
and
i
would
say
that
that
he
is
paid
a
salary
to
use
it,
he
is
supposed
--
there
is
no
difference
in
private
person.
he
is
doing
government
business
on
government
property
for
a
pay
and
he
has
the
privilege
of
occupying
that
property.
this
is
the
same
thing
that
continental
is
doing
in
the
government
plant
in
muskegon.
they
are
working
for
pay
on
government
property
doing
the
government's
business
of
building
tank
engines.
now
if
--
i
agree
there
is
a
distinction
between
privilege
and
property
taxes,
i
do
not
–
we
submit
we
cannot
take
a
property
interest,
a
right
of
use,
an
occupancy
of
government
property
and
call
that
privilege
by
just
calling
it
a
privilege.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
substantive
problem,
--
there
are
distinctions
whether
we
paid
put
oakridge
on
salaries
or
had
a
private
contractor
run
it,
the
substantive
problem
is
here
that
government
plans
have
a
major
impact
on
local
communities,
a
tremendous
impact
and
there
is
appreciable
problem.
this
problem
is
one
with
which
congress
can
deal
because
it
alone
can
waive
immunity
of
full
government
property
where
it
caused
an
impact
and
of
plants
in
which
they
have
divided
interest.
it
has
expressly
stated
that
the
lessees
maybe
taxed
for
their
interest
up
to
the
value
of
the
leasehold
interest.
we
believe
that
they
can
be
tax
no
further.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
i
--
even
if
your
honors
disagree
with
position
we
have
presenting
in
this
case,
in
these
two
cases,
the
continental
and
borg-warner,
i
would
believe
that
as
to
the
michigan
personal
property
ad
valorem
tax
on
aircraft
manufacturing
in
process
and
materials,
that
there
the
tax
is
a
--
because
of
the
property
and
there
is
no
other
instance
that
it
falls
on,
it's
not
because
of
the
use
of
the
property.
you
might
say
that
both
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
it's
my
position
that
you
--
my
position
is
that
you
should
take
a
look
at
the
substantive
problem
and
deal
with
the
fact
for
--
since
at
least
for
a
long
time
this
court
had
held
that
federally
owned
property
which
is
really
officially
owned
by
the
united
states
cannot
be
taxed.
i
believe
that
you
should
say
that
a
tax
which
is
called
a
tax
on
that
property
on
the
first
michigan
cases
we
were
talking
about
the
murray
case
is
clearly
that
once
we
find
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the
government
at
substantial
beneficial
ownership
interest
in
those
parts
we
have
power
to
control
over
them.
i
think
you
should
come
to
this
case
and
say
that
they
have
taken
a
property
interest,
the
right
to
use,
which
is
one
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
the
property
and
they
have
taken
this
property
interest
and
said
we
will
tax
this
property
interest,
which
the
occupant
has
by
the
value
the
entire
property
and
that
is
not
an
appropriate
measure
of
the
privilege
which
these
people
of
the
use
they
are
having
of
it
i'd
say.
you
are
taking
property
interest
and
taxing
by
the
whole
property
so
i'd
say
that
–
we
say
that
they're
both
bad.
if
you
disagree
in
this
case
i
think
it'd
be
because
of
the
line
which
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
there
is
always
been
a
distinction
between
a
privilege
tax
and
a
property
tax
and
it
would
be
emphasizing
the
form
that
this
is
the
tax
on
the
right
to
use,
the
privilege
of
use
and
it
would
be
because
of
that,
that
you
would
--
might
disagree
with
us
in
this
case,
but
if
you
adopt
to
that
rule,
it
is
because
of
the
form
of
the
tax
it
is
good,
you
could
not
then
say
that
detroit
personal
property
tax
could
be
well
applied
to
the
government
property.
thank
you
your
honor
i
am
sorry
