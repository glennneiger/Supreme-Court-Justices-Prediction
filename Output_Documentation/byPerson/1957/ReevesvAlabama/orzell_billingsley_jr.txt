mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
of
jeremiah
reeves
versus
state
of
alabama
as
reported
at
340
u.s.
891,
75
supreme
court
214
cites
two
cases
in
the
season
of
this
court.
there
was
no
direction
given
by
this
court
and
the
case
was
not
remanded.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
just
a
reversal
and
however
we
take
the
position
that
this
reversal,
unqualified
reversal
amounted
to
a
plea
of
not
guilty
so
far
as
defendant
is
--
was
concerned
and
that
the
defendant
should
have
been
discharged.
we
--
this
case
was
decided
upon
by
this
court
in
december
1954
and
the
defendant
was
held
in
jail
until
may
of
1955
at
which
time
he
was
again
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
death.
we
feel
that
any
discussion
of
our
motions
relative
to
the
indictment
in
the
grand
jury
should
have
been
considered
by
the
court.
on
november
the
14th
as
we've
already
said,
the
defendant
was
indicted
and
he
was
arraigned
on
november
15th
which
i'm
sure
was
less
than
the
indictment
--
the
arraignment
followed
the
indictment
less
than
24
hours.
the
--
the
juries
of
the
honorable
court
of
montgomery
has
this
--
has
this
discretion
to
allow
the
defendant
in
such
cases
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
not
guilty
and
in
this
case,
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
where
a
man
is
being
tried
before
a
court
and
his
life
is
in
jeopardy
that
it
would
not
have
been
any
trap
at
all
for
the
court
to
allow
counsel
for
the
defendant
or
petitioner
to
go
into
the
indictment
in
the
grand
jury.
an
interesting
thing
about
the
jury
commission
of
montgomery
county
is
that
it
is
composed
of
the
two
circuit
judges,
the
sheriff
of
the
county,
the
judge
of
the
probate
court
and
the
clerk
of
the
court.
the
record
will
show
that
the
honorable
judge
carter
has
been
a
judge
of
montgomery
county
for
21
years.
the
record
will
show
that
the
honorable
judge
walter
b.
jones
has
been
a
judge
of
montgomery
county
for
20
years.
the
record
will
show
that
mr.
john
r.
mathews
who
is
clerk
of
the
court
had
been
clerk
for
20
years.
and
all
during
that
time,
these
men
have
served
as
jury
commissioners.
mr.
john
r.
mathews
is
also
the
clerk
of
the
jury
commission.
montgomery
is
somewhat
different
from
most
of
the
counties
in
alabama
and
that
any
qualified
citizen
might
be
appointed
as
a
member
of
the
jury
commission.
but
in
montgomery,
under
the
local
law,
they
have
to
be
either
judge,
sheriff,
probate
judge,
or
clerk
of
the
court
to
be
a
member
of
the
jury
commission.
now,
concerning
the
fact
that
these
three
men
mentioned
have
been
commissioners
or
jury
supervisors,
whatever
you
call,
for
20
years
in
a
county
where
the
population
is
60%
white,
40%
colored,
that
they
could
held
during
that
time
very
easily
to
familiarize
themselves
of
the
people
of
that
county.
it's
different
from
other
counties
and
that
the
commissioners
might
serve
a
year
or
two
years
or
whatnot
and
then
they
have
to
come
in
and
adjust
themselves
to
the
situation,
but
we
find
that
even
the
honorable
jurist
eugene
carter
being
asked
about
the
grand
juries
in
montgomery
county.
this
question
is
put
to
him.
“do
you
know
of
any
occasions
when
two
or
more
negroes
sit
on
a
grand
jury?"
he
answers.
"i
recall
one
said."
he
further
states
on
page
55
of
the
printed
record
and
asked
this.
now,
the
question,
“do
you
recall
the
largest
number
of
negroes
you
saw
serving
on
a
jury
at
one
time?"
answer:
"no,
i
wouldn't
know."
question:
"have
you
ever
seen
as
many
as
four?"
answer:
"it
is
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
as
many
as
four
or
how
many.
i
don't
know;
"we
hardly
pick
a
jury
now
without
--
now,
listen
to
this.
"we
would
hardly
pick
a
jury
now
about
having
over
four."
question:"four
negro
jurors?"
answer:
"i
remember
at
one
time
there
were
very
few.
in
fact,
we
were
not
able
to
get
them
until
the
last
year
or
two."
now,
this
is
in
1955
of
making.
jeremiah
reeves
was
indicted
on
november
14,
1952.
that
is
the
mission
on
the
part
of
the
witness
here
that
during
that
time,
they
had
very
few
negroes
on
the
jury
list.
now,
in
1955,
when
he's
being
tried
and
we
asked
the
court
to
let
us
withdraw
the
pleas
of
the
defendant
and
file
our
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
the
court
refused.
and
certainly,
it
seems
that
the
type
of
testimony
which
we
have
in
the
case
of
this
kind
that
there
is
discrimination
or
there
was
in
1952,
discrimination
in
montgomery
county,
alabama.
now,
we
are
not
alleging
before
this
court
the
proposition
as
put
to
you
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
proportional
representation.
we
are
not
arguing
that,
but
we
are
saying
as
your
decision
--
decisions
hold
that
the
selection
of
jurors
should
be
done
according
to
the
court
of
alabama.
that
is
considering
all
the
qualifications
out
there
that
they
will
include
men,
just
men
between
the
ages
of
21
and
65.
that's
all
we
asked,
but
the
testimony
will
show
that
the
witnesses
in
their
anxiety
to
be
fair
to
testify
that
they
deliberately
went
out
and
got
negroes
and
put
them
on
the
list.
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
law
either.
i
don't
think
it
should
be
a
matter
of
inclusion
or
exclusion,
just
a
fair
system
of
operation.
that's
all
we
asked
and
in
order
to
try
this
defendant
before
their
court.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
well,
the
selective
element,
your
honor
--
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
well,
just
generally
--
just
generally,
there
should
be
a
selective
method
--
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
--
but
it
should
not
be
one
where
you
do
it
in
our
argument
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
agree
to
that
and
--
and
on
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
sir?
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
that's
--
that's
my
belief,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
type
of
selection
which
will
be
a
selective
method,
you
might
have
a
grand
jury
concerned
of
population
in
montgomery
county
of
all
negroes,
all
white.
you
may
have
all
negroes
of
five
or
six.
but
now,
this
is
a
pretty
peculiar
situation
that
even
the
solicitor
on
cross-examination,
i
asked
him
about
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
jeremiah
reeves.
i
asked
him,
question:
"were
there
any
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
jeremiah
reeves,
jr.?"
he
answers,
“i
do
not
know
for
sure.
my
best
judgment
states,
i
wouldn't
know.
my
best
judgment
would
be
no.
it
will
be
no.”
now,
it
is
--
it
--
it
could
be
peculiar
for
you
have
18
men
on
the
grand
jury
and
all
of
them
are
white
men.
every
one
of
them
is
white
men.
now,
that
could
happen,
but
it's
peculiar.
it
makes
me
suspicious.
i
just
--
i
can't
explain
it.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
--
it
possibly
would.of
course
in
montgomery
county,
it's
different
from
most
of
the
county.
you
have
a
highly
intelligent
--
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
--
selection
of
negroes
in
that
county.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
the
change
--
mr.
orzell
billingsley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
it
seems
that's
referred
to
by
the
honorable
judge
carter
that
is
also
gratifying
to
me,
but
the
change
referred
to
by
him
came
about
after
jeremiah
reeves
was
arraigned
and
indicted
and
convicted.
and
of
course,
our
--
our
question
that
changed
according
to
the
evidence.
our
time
is
short
and
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
statement
concerning
the
demurrers
made
by
the
solicitor
in
this
case
regarding
the
naacp.
i
think
it
--
it
tended
to
prejudice
the
minds
of
the
jurors
or
as
far
as
the
statement
is
concerned
in
which
he
mentioned
that
this
case
was
being
financed
by
the
naacp.
he
could
have
easily
asked
me
and
i
would
have
told
him
who
spend
for
the
case
of
jeremiah
reeves,
but
i
think
we
know
very
well
the
status
of
the
naacp
in
the
state
of
alabama,
cases
before
you
now
of
the
case
of
naacp,
but
we
submit
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
(inaudible).
