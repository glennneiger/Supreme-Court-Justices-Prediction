mr.
hall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
a
right
that
the
second
trial,
the
trial
in
which
there
was
(inaudible)
in
which
they
had
this
conviction
which
you
refer,
was
on
the
original
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
refresh
my
recollection
because
i
ought
to
remember
this
but
i
don't.
when
the
case
was
here,
1954
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
the
question
of
the
makeup
of
the
grand
jury
panel
as
well
as
the
selection
urged
on
this
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
draw
any
instance.
i
just
want
to
know
the
fact.
that
was
true,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
urged
and
argued
--
the
briefs
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
argument
and
accounted
by
counsel
for
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
are
now
--
you
are
now
--
you
are
now
again
challenging
the
validity,
the
constitutional
of
validity
of
the
indictment
because
of
the
composition
of
the
panel,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
way
of
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
situation
also
from
your
point
of
view
is
ameliorated
or
changed
as
to
grand
jury
--
serve
on
grand
jury
on
the
panel
from
which
grand
jury
to
draw?
justice
felix
frankfurter
criminal
petty
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
mention
the
question
of
the
confessions
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
but
you're
going
to
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
may
i
interrupt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
refreshment
or
recollection.
when
were
the
so-called
confessions
which
were
introduced
with
--
on
the
record
that
came
here?
when
was
it
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wednesday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
crime
on
monday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
have
a
--
did
he
have
a
lawyer
of
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
at
the
time
--
the
monday
and
wednesday,
the
wednesday
that
the
statement
was
made
to
mrs.--
whatever
her
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
set
for
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
that
i
would
fairly
understand
if
you
would
say
if
you
prefer
not
to
answer
the
question.
needless
to
say,
i
think
the
question
is
--
is
not
irrelevant
or
it's
not
inclusive,
otherwise
i
wouldn't
put
it
but
it
bears
on
--
not
on
this
case
or
not
on
the
present
aspect
of
the
case,
but
prior
to
the
fact
that
it
came
here
once
before
and
we
got
a
prosecution
here.
we've
got
a
case
here
for
a
crime
committed
six
--
merely
six
years
ago.
and
i
regard
it
as
not
a
happy
circumstance
to
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law.
i'm
sure
you
don't
either.
and
so
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
source
of
the
difficulty,
namely
the
confession.
this
is
for
my
enlightenment
and
possibly
for
the
future
cases
bearing
on
these
confession
cases
that
come
here.
some
years
ago,
we
had
a
case
coming
here
from
another
state.
unimportant
but
for
all
other
state
in
which
we
reversed
the
conviction
of
a
defendant
who
was
probably
guilty,
but
not
tried
according
to
what
we
found
to
be
due
process
because
of
an
illicit
confession.
and
thereupon,
it
interested
me
greatly
that
the
city
from
the
state
in
which
this
case
came
here
made
it
a
practice
and
i
assume
it
continues
that
no
statement
of
an
accused
person
was
taken
by
the
police,
except
in
the
presence
of
some
disinterested
witnesses.
i
don't
mean
picked
by
it,
but
--
but
some
people
of
--
of
word
in
the
community,
ex
officio
people.
first,
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
which
--
which
takes
care
of
conflict
as
to
what
the
circumstances
on
which
a
confession
was
made
and
what
was
promised
and
what
wasn't
promised
and
whether
the
--
there
was
psychological,
physical
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
but
i
would
like
to
ask
an
experienced
prosecutor
like
yourself,
if
i
may
say
so.
what
--
what
--
whether
you
care
to
say,
whether
that
would
embarrass
the
point
of
view
of
those
who
have
the
responsibility
of
prosecuting
the
trial,
whether
such
a
practice
which
would
take
care
of
a
lot
of
this
business.
if
statements
are
made
in
the
presence
of
this
(inaudible)
as
a
regular
thing,
would
you
care
to
express
their
view
whether
that
was
hurtful
or
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
talk
to
him
--
before
you
--
before
you
talked
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
have
you
called
him
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
end
of
a
process
as
it
was
of
two
or
three
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
five-hundred
felonies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
felony
in
your
state
means
what
in
terms
of
punishment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
the
question
of
how
many
are
on
the
panel
rather
than
the
process
by
which
there
is
a
panel
selected?
is
it
a
question
of
numbers
or
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
of
course
if
no
negroes
ever
on
the
panel
and
you've
got
a
sizeable
negro
population,
a
potential
body
of
jurors
and
if
there
never
is
a
colored
person
on
the
panel,
that's
an
awfully
good
piece
of
evidence
that
there's
something
that
matter
with
the
process.
but
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
one
or
two
as
against
some
other
proportion
of
white,
doesn't
prove
that
there
is
discrimination,
is
it
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
is
it
--
i'll
go
back
to
my
question.
is
it
a
question
of
numbers
if
the
fact
there
were
three
or
four,
does
that
settle
it?
and
if
there's
only
one,
it
settles
it
the
other
way?
do
you
concede
that's
to
be
the
problem?
except
there's
evidentiary
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
these
numbers
because
this
court
has
held
that
it
doesn't
require
to
have
a
proportion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
even
on
the
panel,
you
are
regularly
always
two
negroes
wouldn't
disprove
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
to
the
specific
things.
i'm
trying
to
get
the
standard,
the
criteria,
the
basis
on
which
judgment
must
be
made,
not
the
particular
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
here
on
the
grand
--
aren't
we
concerned
with
the
grand
jury
panel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
claim
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
man
compared
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
issued
from
a
discriminating
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
mr.
hall
--
did
i
hear
mr.
hall
correct
me
to
say
that
it
is
judge
carter's
testimony
that
in
--
i
forget
what.
in
the
course
of
20,
19
years
whatever
it
was,
he'd
seen
only
one
colored
man
on
the
grand
jury
or
during
that
whole
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
mr.
hall
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
judge
carter
testify
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
he
did
not
testified
that
in
those
20
years,
whatever
it
was,
there
was
only
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thetford,
what
educational
institutions
other
--
other
than
primary
schools
are
there
in
montgomery
to
which
negroes
have
access?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
montgomery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
has
sizeable
negro
faculties?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
it's
a
principal
question,
but
i
would
call
in
the
state
(inaudible)
is
he
consulted
as
one
of
the
people
who
--
he
would
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
negro
lawyers
in
montgomery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
two,
negro
doctors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
dentist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
professional
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
and
he's
excused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
businessmen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
of
--
some
inside?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
got
a
negro
architect
by
any
chance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
difference
in
the
record
on
this
discrimination
question
and
the
present
record
as
to
--
as
compared
with
the
one
we
had
before
us
in
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
full
of
means
what
is
bearing
on
wether
there
is
a
reason
of
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
if
cases
go
up
from
the
trial
court
to
your
supreme
court,
and
your
supreme
court
reverses
for
error
in
the
admission
of
evidence
for
erroneous
charge
or
anyone
of
the
grounds
on
which
a
state
court
can
and
your
supreme
court
does
reversed,
you've
got
a
good
many
reversals
over
the
years
unfortunately.
when
it
goes
back,
you
--
you
continue
it
as
what
--
as
though
--
as
those
what,
still
part
of
the
original
indictment
and
arraignment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
--
when
did
the
case
get
back
to
you
for
trial
after
we
got
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
that's
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
tried
him
in
may?
did
you
try
him
in
may
1955?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
got
a
verdict
in
may?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
did
it
get
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
the
next
year,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
because
of
the
(inaudible),
i
mean,
the
business
of
your
course?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
it's
submitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
a
heavy
(inaudible)
about
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
derived
from
my
greatest
(inaudible)
delayed
does
not
meant
criticism
to
you.
this
is
true
to
our
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
does
your
view
--
does
your
view
leave
any
room
for
any
kind
of
selective
process
other
than
an
automatic
process
of
--
i'm
not
sure
i
know
how
that
would
be.
if
you
have
to
have
a
panel
of
--
of
binary
of
50,
how
would
you
go
about
getting
50
--
a
process
that
simply
involves
some
kind
of
selection
which
is
capable
of
potential
--
potentially
capable
of
the
exercise
of
some
kind
of
real
bias
in
new
york
city
or
in
montgomery?
how
would
you
get
50?
would
you
--
i
suppose
you
could
have
a
list
of
--
an
alphabetical
list
of
all
the
male
between
21
and
65
in
montgomery
and
then
taking
down
the
line,
but
sure
of
that
wouldn't
--
isn't
there
necessarily
--
does
necessarily
some
selective
element
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case,
but
just
generally.
wouldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more.
i
agree
with
you
as
much
as
you
agree
with
yourself.
what
i
want
to
know
is
in
selecting
people,
wouldn't
there
be
some
--
wouldn't
some
question
of
--
i
should
think
i'm
at
the
brink
of
the
word
discretion
--
some
question
of
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
have
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
got
standard
(inaudible)
of
people
who
are
fit
for
the
--
for
the
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
service,
the
determination
where
the
(inaudible)
involved
some
choice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
automatic,
can
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
have
an
automatic
system,
except
in
the
way
in
which
i
have
indicated
that
you've
got
a
list
of
everybody
in
the
particular
community
and
then
go
down
the
line
automatically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
your
jury
requirement
include
literacy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
had
--
if
you
had
a
community
--
i'm
not
saying
montgomery
of
course.
if
you
had
a
community
in
which
for
one
reason
or
another,
there
was
a
portion
of
the
population
although
citizens
predominantly
couldn't
write.
we
have
known
countries
that
are
now
in
some
foreign
countries
like
india
in
which
i
don't
know
what
the
percentage
of
literacy
there
the
other
day.
it's
rapidly
being
cut
down
in
literacy.
you
might
get
a
situation
where
an
allowable
standard
of
selection
would
exclude
a
certain
group.
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i'm
not
--
it's
remote
to
mean
to
suggest
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
thinking
of
judge
carter
with
the
interesting
statement
about
the
change
that
is
taking
place
to
meet
the
gratifying
things
to
read
that,
i
hope.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
impliedly
that
if
he
said
there
are
good
to
offer
and
bad
to
offer,
good
wives
and
bad
wives,
so
he
could
say
also
good
husband
and
bad
husband.
