mr.
robert
b.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
planned
about
20
plus
--
30-minute
talk.
i'll
see
if
i
could
compress
that
into
five
minutes
that
i
have
remaining.
there
were
several
points
briefed
which
i
would
like
to
talk
to,
but
i
would
try
to
limit
it
to
one
point
only
in
the
time
that
i
have
and
that
is
the
oral
examination
of
the
jurors.
the
defendant
has
raised
a
point
about
a
question
as
to
all
jurors.
the
solicitor
asked
the
court
to
qualify
the
jurors
as
to
membership
in
the
naacp.
now,
the
defendant
at
that
time
objected
to
that
question
being
asked
to
jurors.
the
solicitor
then
stated
that
it
was
his
information
that
the
naacp
was
financing
this
case
and
he
would
like
that
information
to
be
helpful
to
him
in
striking
the
jury.
of
course
--
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
sir?
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
openly
in
the
presence
of
all
jurors,
yes
sir,
because
all
jurors
are
sitting
in
the
court
room.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
yes,
sir.
now
that
was
not
said
until
objection
was
made
to
the
question
that
they'd
be
qualified
as
to
membership.
now,
that
--
that
belief
of
course
comes
to
us
from
the
fact
that
the
name
of
the
chief
counsel,
general
counsel
of
naacp
appears
on
the
last
brief
in
this
court.
that's
our
understanding
from
the
record.
and
to
prove
that
it
was
a
useful
question,
i
point
out
to
you
that
the
record
shows
three
of
the
jurors
when
they
were
so
qualified,
stated
that
they
were
members
of
the
naacp.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
no,
sir.
you
may
--
you
may
ask
the
question
upon
your
own
understanding.
you're
trying
to
find
out
what
the
man's
connections
are.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
let
me
--
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
that
is
asked
on
all
negligence
cases.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
well,
in
negligence
cases
to
--
to
answer
that
that
is
a
stock
question.
we
--
we
generally
can
find
out
from
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
the
name
of
his
insurance
company
and
we
qualify
the
jury
as
to
that
company.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
no,
sir.
generally,
you
ask
that
question
privately
of
the
attorney
on
the
other
side.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
no,
no.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
no,
sir.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
read
to
the
court
the
--
the
statute
under
which
we
examine
our
--
our
jurors.
title
30
of
section
52
of
our
code
provides
that
in
all
civil
and
criminal
cases,
either
parties
shall
have
the
right
to
examine
jurors
as
to
their
qualifications,
interest
or
bias
that
would
affect
the
trial
of
the
case
and
shall
have
the
right
under
the
direction
of
the
court
to
examine
said
jurors
as
to
any
matter
that
might
tend
to
affect
their
verdict.
now,
there
seemed
to
be
two
--
there
seemed
to
be
two
different
rules
and
different
jurisdiction.
some
courts
limit
questions
to
what
may
affect
the
qualification
of
a
juror.
we
do
not.
our
cases
say
that
we
may
examine
on
anything
that
will
help
determine
a
man's
interest
by
his
prejudice
or
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
through
the
judge.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
he
--
he
qualified
every
juror.
that
way,
they
called
up
in
groups
of
five
and
qualified
generally
and
the
judge
does
of
course.
we
don't
do
it
ourselves.
now,
such
type
of
--
of
question
has
been
approved
by
our
courts.
the
question
is
briefed.
the
second
and
last
question
is
the
matter
of
excluding
the
public
from
the
trial.
we
have
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
allowing
the
court
and
the
judge
to
clear
the
court
in
rape
cases.
that
was
done
in
this
case,
except
for
the
man's
families,
counsel,
the
press,
his
preacher
and
so
forth.
now,
that
question
was
before
when
argued
the
case
last
time
also
and
it
was
very
thoroughly
briefed
and
argued.
it
is
briefed
this
time,
but
i
do
not
have
time
to
argue.
i
--
i
had
hoped
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
in
this
case,
but
time
is
--
is
running
out.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
no,
sir.
when
you
say
change
and
preceded,
do
you
mean
some
kind
of
statutory
change?
mr.
robert
b.
stewart
yes,
sir,
it
did.
