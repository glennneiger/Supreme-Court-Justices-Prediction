justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
the
reference
showed
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
were
eight
negroes
on
the
county
and
agreed
on
--
on
the
aide
of
the
matter.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
three
on
the
panel
that
tried
this
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
were
not
been
served
on
this
jury
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
they
were
called
to
serve
on
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
stricken
for
(inaudible)
presumably
by
the
prosecution.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
had
counsel
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
where
did
he
get
counsel?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
that
was
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
was
tried
on
the
26th?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
what,
on
the
same
month?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
he
had
a
lawyer
and
as
i
understand
the
point
--
well,
can
you
tell
us
precisely
when
he
had
a
lawyer?
was
it
on
the
14th
the
day
he
was
indicted?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
important
to
me
because
i
want
to
know
how
much
time
intervened
from
the
time
he
had
a
lawyer
until
he
had
to
plea
in
this
case.

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
by
choice,
but
by
lot?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
the
theory
of
how
many
were
actually
on
the
jury
trying
the
case.
this
is
a
quick
question.
how
many
were
on
the
panel?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
don't
think
the
observation
that
i
had
in
mind
quite
clear
is
this
(inaudible)
what
you
mean
by
panel.
to
me,
the
panel
is
the
final
12
sworn
to
try
a
lawsuit.
now,
the
fact
that
there
are
no
negroes
on
that
jury,
doesn't
mean
that
in
the
process
of
selection
from
the
binary,
there
may
not
have
been
six
restricken
on
each
side
for
cause
or
peremptorily,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
on
that.
how
would
one
know
who
was
on
the
grand
jury
in
the
--
as
a
general
proposition
cannot
convene
privately?
they're
not
in
--
they're
only
in
court
when
they're
selected
and
when
they
returned
indictment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that
were
called
for
service
(voice

on
the
panel
and
subjected
to
the
board
for
examination.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
you've
(inaudible)
haven't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
is
no
board
wide
examination?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
of
the
whole
35
or
more
--
if
there
are
more
present.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
--
but
he
did
pleaded.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
said
is
openly
in
the
presence
of
hearing
of
all
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
practice
even
in
the
civil
case,
i
assume
we
have
issues
arising
as
to
whether
or
not
jurors
made
to
examine
the
negligence
cases
as
to
whether
the
defendant
has
or
doesn't
have
insurance.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
permitted
to
ask
such
broader
questions
upon
an
understanding
or
do
you
not
have
to
have
some
admission
if
you
use
such
insurance
before
you're
permitted
to
ask
the
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wouldn't
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
wouldn't
it
be
justice
prejudicial
in
a
civil
case
to
say
mr.
juror
or
general,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
or
(inaudible)
stockholders,
policy
holders
of
et
cetera,
the
traveler's
insurance
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
it
would
be
to
tell
them
that
that
so
was
to
not
first
have
some
admission
that
it
is
the
fact.
can
you
do
it
just
on
your
standing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
have
that
shown
in
the
record
before
you
ask
questions,
don't
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes
and
then
have
that
shown
in
the
record
do
you
not?
that
he
admits
that
he
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
don't?
