mr.
hall,
what
was
the
ground
in
which
the
state
court
denied
your
motion
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
motion
to
quash
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
came
too
late.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
1952
challenge
with
the
grand
jury?
did
he
have
a
hearing
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion
here?
there
was
a
hearing
at
that
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
1952
challenge
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
statement
is
raised.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
to
clear
my
mind?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
say
that
he
did
not
press
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
his
denial
of
his
motion
to
quash
the
grand
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
did
he
press
--
did
he
seek
to
press
it
up
here
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
misunderstood
something
that
you
said
earlier
then
because
i
thought
you
would
argue
that
although
the
court
here
did
not
pass
on
the
grand
jury
question
in
1954
and
they
had
an
opportunity
to
do
so
and
therefore,
you
could
assume
that
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
petty
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
go
back
to
the
jury
point
a
minute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
change
in
your
procedures
in
alabama
between
the
1952
motion
to
quash
and
1955
motion
to
quash?
justice
john
m.
harlan
none?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
mean
mr.
thetford
described
the
procedure,
wasn't
that
obtained
in
1952
as
well
as
in
1955?
