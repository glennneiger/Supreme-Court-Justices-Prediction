mr.
william
f.
thetford
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we,
my
colleague
and
i,
mr.
stewart
are
here
as
the
solicitor
and
deputy
solicitor
who
prosecuted
this
case,
prosecuted
it
both
the
first
time
and
the
second
time.
we're
here
by
order
and
direction
of
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
alabama.
we
are
dividing
our
time
and
i
propose
to
argue
in
this
order,
is
the
board
of
jury
supervisors
of
montgomery
county
systematically
excluding
negroes
because
of
race
or
color
and
let
me
explain
this
that
what
i
say
would
apply
equally
to
grand
or
petty
juries
because
they're
all
drawn
out
of
the
same
box.
does
due
process
require
the
reindictment,
rearraignment
of
the
defendant
for
a
second
trial?
did
due
process
require
the
trial
court
to
allow
the
defendant
to
withdraw
his
pleas
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
entered
on
november
the
15th,
1952
upon
a
subsequent
trial
held
after
reversal
of
this
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
new
--
the
request
being
made
on
may
30th,
1955
and
should
the
defendant
have
been
allowed
to
inquire
into
this
efficiency
of
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
those
are
the
four
of
the
points
which
have
been
argued.
mr.
stewart
will
cover
the
two
remaining
points
which
are
the
certain
remarks
which
were
made
and
certainly
a
request
that
was
made
in
the
qualifying
of
the
jury
or
trial,
the
actual
trial
jury
and
the
question
of
excluding
the
public
from
a
court
room
during
the
trial
of
case
--
a
rape
case,
case
of
this
nature.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
there
is
no
question
of
a
confession
in
here.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
what
--
are
we
going
to
deal
with
it?
mr.
william
f.
thetford
well,
there
is.
the
state
offered
no
confession
or
anything
approaching
a
confession.
he
said
so,
but
i'm
--
and
i'm
going
to
answer
that.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
but
that
is
simply
our
concern
on
the
statement
of
the
fact.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
i
will.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
--
getting
into
my
argument
as
--
on
the
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
jury.
i
would
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
the
confession.
the
state
of
alabama
introduced
no
confession
in
the
case
that
we
are
now
considering.
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
went
a
little
into
the
background.
i
think
it
will
probably
answer
several
questions.
jeremiah
reeves
was
arrested
on
november
12,
1952.he
was
carried
for
safekeeping,
took
care
of
the
penitentiary
which
is
a
short
distance
form
the
city
of
montgomery.
he
made
a
confession
on
--
the
12th
was
on
monday.
he
made
a
confession
on
tuesday,
tuesday
afternoon.
he
made
the
confession
in
my
presence.
that
confession
was
recorded
and
i
believe
later
reduced
to
writing
and
signed.
on
wednesday
morning,
he
was
carried
to
the
city
hall,
the
police
headquarters
of
montgomery
as
located
in
the
city
hall.
and
there,
he
was
identified
by
(inaudible),
who
at
that
time
was
a
19-year-old
white
woman
who
identified
him
as
the
person
who
had
raped
her
on
july
the
28th.
he
was
subsequently
--
now,
according
to
--
we've
got
in
kind
of
into
both
records
in
this
case
and
i
presume
you'll
let
me
maybe
refer
to
the
first
record.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
it's
a
--
here
in
court.
on
the
trial
--
on
his
firs
trial,
both
he
and
his
mother
testified
that
she
had
seen
him
on
wednesday
which
would
be
november
the
12th.in
the
second
trial
that
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
well,
the
--
no,
he
was
arrested
on
the
10th,
monday
the
10th.
on
the
12th,
he
said
that
he
--
that
is
in
the
first
record.
both
he
and
his
mother
testified
that
they
saw
each
other
on
the
--
on
the
12th.
now,
in
the
second
trial
which
--
to
where
the
trials
go.
they
both
testified
that
it
was
the
13th,
rather
than
the
12th.
he
was
arraigned
on
the
--
i
mean
indicted
on
the
14th
and
arraigned
on
the
15th.
now,
in
the
first
trial,
we
had
--
well
now,
we
don't
admit
all
that
he
says
in
his
--
in
his
pleading
as
the
way
that
confession
was
taken.
we
have
never
admitted
that,
but
we
had
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
it
was
taken
in
a
manner
that
was
legal.
we
did
not
introduce
the
written
confession
or
the
recorded
confession
in
the
first
trial.
we
did
introduce
in
the
first
trial
certain
remarks
that
he
made
to
mrs.
crowder
at
the
police
headquarters
on
the
12th.
we
also
introduced
testimony
from
his
psychiatrist
who
had
examined
him
some
time
later.
and
in
the
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist,
there
was
a
confession
involved.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
this
court
reversed
in
the
first
case.
in
the
second
case
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
one
was
a
conversation
that
he
had
with
the
complaining
witness
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
--
on
wednesday
morning.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
on
wednesday.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
crime
on
monday
and
on
wednesday.
now,
in
the
second
trial
of
this
case,
the
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
he
was
arrested
on
monday.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
several
months,
sir,
yes.on
the
second
trial,
we
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
lawyer
of
his
own
choice
and
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
i'm
sure
he
did
not.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
i
think
the
lawyer
was
employed.
maybe,
i
don't
--
the
record,
it
doesn't
show
when
the
lawyer
was
employed
and
i
--
i
can't
state
definitely
when
he
was
employed
or
--
but
i
am
sure
that
he
was
not
employed
on
wednesday.
now
--
however,
the
confession
is
completely
out
of
this
case.
we
introduced
no
confession
and
this
record
contains
no
confession
of
any
kind,
nature
or
description
on
the
second
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
well,
he's
--
he's
claiming
that.
i
--
i
will
get
that.
but
what
i
wanted
to
clear
up
in
the
court's
mind
before
we
got
any
further
that
there
is
no
confession
in
this
case.
we
introduced
no
confession
of
any
kind.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
at
the
trial.
now,
what
i
think
he
possibly
is
referring
to
was
introduced
by
the
defendant,
not
by
the
state.
now,
on
cross-examination,
you'll
find
this
in
page
237
of
the
record.on
recross-examination
of
the
--
of
ms.
crowder,
lawyer
hall,
“let
me
ask
you
a
little
something
further
with
reference
to
your
last
identification
of
this
defendant
in
november,”
referring
to
november
1952.
“were
you
told
on
that
occasion
he
had
confessed
before
you
looked
at
him?”
“i
was
given
a
written
statement,
but
it
wasn't
sanctioned.”
now,
that
is
the
first
reference
to
any
confession
whatsoever
in
this
case
and
that
is
in
this
--
i
believe
it's
the
only
reference
to
it
and
it
was
brought
out
by
the
defendant,
not
by
the
state.
“you
are
given
a
statement
or
a
statement
alleged
made
by
this
defendant”.
“i
suppose
so.it
had
his
name
on
it,
but
it
wasn't
signed.”
“it
did
have
his
name
on
it?”
“yes.”
“you
were
given
that
statement
before
you
looked
at
him?”
“that
is
right.”
“you
have
read
that
statement
before
you
looked
at
him?”
“did
any
of
the
officers
down
there
tell
you
he
had
confessed
or
did
they
make
any
statement
at
all
to
you
with
reference
to
that
confession?”
“no.”
now
certainly,
the
state
cannot
be
held
accountable
to
anything
that
was
injected
into
this
case
by
the
defendant.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
it
would
not
be
hurtful.
we
have
done
it
in
our
--
our
more
important
cases,
whether
there
was
a
question
involved.
we
have
called
in
ministers
and
other
decent
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
we
have
never
done
it.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
when
he's
getting
ready
to
make
a
confession
or
when
--
when
it's
indicated
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
confession.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
you
--
you
find
this,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
you'll
find
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
suppose
it's
true
in
--
in
all
places
as
moderately
big
as
montgomery
is.
we
handle
500
felonies
a
year
with
the
staff
of
one
prosecutor
and
two
part-time
prosecutors.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
five-hundred
felonies
a
year.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
a
year
or
more
in
the
penitentiary.
it's
--
we
would
entirely
have
responsible
people
in
montgomery
coming
in
to
listen
to
these
things
if
we
did.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
going
answer
to
your
question
or
not,
but
it
--
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
do
it.
it
might
--
it
might
be
a
very
wise
thing
to
do,
i
would
say
that.
now,
i
think
i've
answered
the
question
as
to
the
confession.
there
is
no
confession
in
this
case.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
confession
case.
they
don't
--
they
don't
really
reached
that
in
their
brief
except
in
a
kind
of
backward
way
where
they
say,
“well,
the
woman
had
seen
something,”
a
statement,
unsigned
statement
and
thereby
she
--
her
--
her
identification
of
the
defendant
might
in
some
way
be
affected.
of
course,
that
really
goes
to
the
credibility
of
the
witness
and
not
to
whether
she
can
testify
or
not.
they
can
ask
that
before
a
jury,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
preclude
her
from
testifying
if
she
seen
a
state
--
unsigned
statement,
no
--
no
law
that
says
that.
i'd
like
now
to
get
to
the
question
of
which
i
think
is
really
the
heart
of
this
case.
i
--
i
maybe
wrong,
but
i
think
that
after
the
question,
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
in
the
grand
--
in
the
juries
of
montgomery
county
really
is
the
heart
of
--
of
this
case.
the
law
i
think
is
well-known
to
--
to
us
that
we
--
we
have
a
board
of
jury
supervisors
composed
of
the
two-circuit
judges,
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court,
the
sheriff
and
the
probate
judge
who
makeup
the
jury
list
in
montgomery
county.
it's
done
by
local
act.
we're
the
only
--
only
county
in
the
state
that
has
that
exact
setup.
and
i
think
the
law
is
--
is
clearly
established.
they
may
not
discriminate
in
any
manner
so
far
as
race,
all
color
is
concerned.
also,
that
proportional
representation
as
such
is
--
is
not
required
by
this
court.
this
court
simply
requires
that
your
juries,
the
names
in
the
jury
box
be
selected
without
discrimination.
now,
the
cases
as
i
understand
them
also
hold
that
findings
of
fact
by
a
state
court
will
have
great
weight
with
this
court,
but
of
course
i'm
not
binding
on
it
and
that
this
court
will
look
at
the
facts
to
determine
whether
the
state
court
found
them
correctly
and
applied
them
correctly.
the
evidence
on
proportional
--
i
mean,
on
discrimination
was
set
out
at
length
in
the
opinion
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
i
would
like
to
set
out
the
evidence
at
length
and
came
to
this
conclusion.
i'm
reading
from
page
476
of
the
record.
a
careful
consideration
of
the
evidence
satisfies
us
that
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
shows
that
there
was
no
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
juries
in
montgomery
county.
we
consider
that
the
court
reached
a
correct
conclusion
and
acted
properly
in
denying
the
motion
to
quash
the
binary.
now
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
to
the
petty
jury
to
the
trial
jury.
now,
the
requirements
for
jurors
in
the
state
of
alabama
is
found
in
section
21
of
title
30
of
the
1940
code
of
alabama
and
i'll
brief
it
just
a
little
bit,
but
essentially
all
male
citizens
of
the
county
who
are
generally
reputed
to
be
honest
and
intelligent
men
and
are
staying
in
the
community
for
their
integrity,
good
character
and
sound
judgment.
that
is
the
requirement
for
a
juror.
now,
there
are
some
exceptions
to
that
such
as
they
must
be
over
21.
they
cannot
be
suffering
from
a
permanent
disease.
they're
illiterate
and
even
there
on
someone
who
cannot
read,
they
say
if
they
are
a
property
holder
that
can
--
maybe
waived
and
there
are
a
large
number
of
exemptions
from
jury
duty
which
is
found
in
section
3
of
tittle
30.
i
don't
think
they're
immaterial
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.now,
the
requirement
of
alabama
law
is
that
the
board
of
jury
supervisors
plays
or
make
up
a
jury
list
of
all
citizens
of
the
county
which
have
the
requirement,
which
i
have
just
read.
then,
they
make
--
found
that
jury
list.
i
might
say
that
on
the
jury
list,
there
is
contained
the
man's
name,
his
occupation,
his
business
address
and
his
residence
address
and
nothing
else.
from
that
jury
role,
the
clerk
of
the
board
of
jury
supervisors
prepares
a
small
white
card
which
contains
the
man's
name,
his
business
or
profession,
his
residence
address
and
his
business
address
and
nothing
else.
all
cards
are
uniform.
the
only
other
thing
on
that
would
be
a
number
which
is
keyed
to
the
number
in
the
jury
role.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
all
male
jurors
in
the
state
of
alabama.
it's
been
a
considerable
agitation
to
have
women,
but
it
hadn't
come
about
yet.
those
cards
are
placed
in
a
jury
box
or
a
jury
wheel,
whichever
you
want
to
call
it.
it's
a
large
metal
box.
the
judge
and
the
clerk
each
have
keys
to
that
box
and
it's
kept
in
a
vault
at
all
times.
the
juries
in
montgomery
county
are
all
drawn
from
that
box.
your
petty
juries
are
drawn
in
open
court
from
that
box.
your
grand
juries
are
drawn.
the
names
are
drawn
from
that
box
and
both
civil
and
criminal
petty
juries
are
drawn
from
that
box.
in
other
words,
that's
--
that's
where
we
get
our
juries,
the
box
is
brought
in
open
court
and
the
judge
will
draw
for
an
ordinary
--
for
a
week,
50
names
from
that
box.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that's
--
no.
that
says
--
we
--
we
run
an
old
kind
of
a
time-court.
in
other
words,
we
have
several
court,
they
will
draw
50
names
for
that
week.
and
we'll
run
civil
court
for
three
weeks
and
then
criminal
court
for
three
weeks
or
a
month.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
we
have
two
judges,
but
we
draw
only
one
--
one
--
50-man
jury.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
they
serve
both
courts,
yes,
sir
mr.
william
f.
thetford
eighteen.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
it's
a
double
lottery.
i
was
going
to
get
into
the
--
the
method
of
selection
of
the
grand
jury.
it
--
it's
--
you
might
refer
to
it
as
a
double
lottery.
the
judge
will
draw
in
open
court
50
names.
now,
they
will
be
subpoenaed,
say
for
two
weeks
from
under
two
weeks
from
then
to
serve
as
the
grand
jury.
when
that
day
arrives,
the
--
those
jurors
who
avail
and
who
have
not
been
excused,
and
i
believe
the
record
shows
they're
ordinarily
35
to
40
who
are
actually
there
in
court.
their
names
are
placed
on
small
white
slips
of
paper,
just
the
name.
they're
placed
in
a
hat
and
the
judge
then
draws
with
the
handkerchief
over
it
and
the
judge
then
draws
in
open
court
blind
folded,
as
you
might
say,
18
names
and
that
constitutes
the
grand
jury.
and
we
have
actually
four
grand
juries
here.
they
ordinarily
will
be
for
a
week
and
not
more
than
10
days
at
a
time.
does
--
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
william
f.
thetford
the
clerk
testified
that
there
are
approximately
3000
names.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
that
--
that's
in
the
--
the
--
that
will
be
3000
name
serving
on
juries
in
montgomery
county.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
approximately
3000.
now,
i've
tried
to
--
to
outline
the
--
the
way
we
draw
them
because
i
think
it
will
help
--
helpful
to
you
in
--
when
we
get
into
the
testimony
as
to
whether
there
is
--
i
might
mention
this,
too.
we're
talking
about
grand
juries.
now,
you're
going
to
find
if
you
read
the
testimony
of
all
of
the
witnesses
on
--
we
had
a
full
hearing
on
systematic
exclusion
in
this
case
and
also
in
the
first
case.
and
you'll
find
a
--
a
kind
of
--
of
a
hesitation
in
any
of
them
saying
just
exactly
how
many
negroes
they've
seen
on
a
jury
here.
how
many
they've
seen
there?
now,
there's
a
reason
for
that.
we
do
not
set
out
juries
aside
where
you
can
look
over
here
and
see
that's
the
jury.
our
juries
are
scattered
all
over
the
court
room,
scattered
in
with
witnesses,
spectators
and
actually,
when
they
draw
a
grand
jury
until
you
actually
see
the
names
pulled
out
of
the
box
and
they
come
up
and
sit
in
the
box,
you
wouldn't
know
who
was
a
juror.
you
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
it.
absolutely,
no
way
of
knowing
how
many
negroes
you
had
--
who
were
there
as
jurors
or
how
many
you
had
spectators
or
witnesses.
now,
we
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
it
is.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
all
together
--
all
together,
a
grand
jury
is
drawn
really
by
two
lots.
you
draw
first
your
--
your
--
the
names
that
are
going
to
be
the
jury
list
and
then
you
draw
in
open
court
by
choice
the
18
men
who
comprise
a
grand
jury.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
by
lot,
by
lot.
yes,
the
judge
has
no
idea
and
you'll
find
in
his
testimony,
he
said
that
he
never
knows
who
he
is
going
to
draw
until
he
actually
opens
up
the
slip
and
reads
the
name.
now,
the
three
jury
supervisors,
three
of
them
testified
on
the
hearing
on
discrimination.
judge
carter
testified.
let
me
--
let
me
explain
one
other
thing
possibly
that
might
be
confusing.
we
have
two-judge
carter's
in
this
case.
we
have
a
regular
circuit
judge,
is
judge
eugene
carter.
when
he
was
subpoenaed
as
a
witness,
as
he
was
by
the
defendant
on
the
hearing
on
motion
to
quash
the
binary,
he
refused
himself
and
james
j.carter
who
was
a
practicing
attorney
in
montgomery
acted
as
special
judge
during
the
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
no,
complaint
here.
we've
done
it
on
statutory
authority.
now,
judge
eugene
carter
who
testified,
testified
this.
we
could
hardly
pick
a
jury
now
without
having
over
four
on
the
jury.
i
think
he
was
referring
that
to
the
binary,
not
to
the
actual
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
--
panel
to
try
a
case.
he
had
--
he
testified
further
that
he
had
seen
seven
negroes
sitting
on
one
case,
trying
a
case.
he
testified
that
he
had
seen
two
negroes
serving
on
a
jury,
trying
a
white
man
for
a
robbery.
he
testified
rather
at
length
that
he
--
that
there
was
no
discrimination
shown
that
they
were
trying
to
get
jurors,
not
necessarily
white
jurors
or
negro
jurors.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that
is
--
that
is
true,
but
we
--
but
we
--
we
find
that
the
only
way
we
can
show
because
there's
--
there's
no
designation
as
negro
or
white
and
about
the
only
way
we
can
show
this
court
how
many
--
that
--
the
negroes
are
regular
serving
on
montgomery
county
juries.
they're
in
the
box
in
substantial
numbers
and
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
i
don't
--
i
think
counsel
says
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
numbers.
it's
a
question
where
they're
discriminated
against.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
but
the
only
we
can
--
we
can
get
at
that
is
kind
of
going
in
the
backdoor
to
show
you
that
they're
on
--
on
the
case.
i
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
now
we're
trying
to
prove
that
it
was
not
discrimination.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
except
there's
evidentiary
fact,
that
would
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that
--
that's
exactly
what
i'm
arguing.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
this
court
the
fact
that
we
have
negro
serving
as
a
matter
of
cause
everyday
and
i
think
the
record
bears
that
statement
after.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that's
--
that's
very
true.
but
we
feel
that
the
--
a
large
measure
--
the
only
way
we
can
show
you
that
they
are
on
the
binary
which
is
the
entire
50
men
or
100
men
group,
is
to
show
you
that
they're
actually
serving
on
juries
which
they
are.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that
--
i
say,
we
feel
that
the
best
way
that
we've
got
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
way
we've
got
because
as
i
told
you,
your
juries
are
so
mixed-in
with
spectators
and
with
witnesses
that
ordinarily
no
one
knows
who's
the
jury
and
who's
not.
we
--
and
we've
got
no
designation
on
anything
that
would
show
a
man
was
white
or
a
man
was
colored.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
well,
we
don't
--
we
--
the
evidence
in
this
shows
that
we
have
varying
numbers
of
negroes.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
well,
the
--
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
evidence
that
was
that
is
in
this
record
shows
this
that
we
have
as
sometimes
a
fair
large
number
of
negro
serving
on
the
juries,
sometimes
no
negroes
at
all.
we
have
--
the
evidence
shows
that
the
witness
has
testified
they
had
seen
as
many
as
five
serving
on
petty
juries
on
several
occasions.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
well,
i
don't
know
if
we
or
not
but
the
evidence
in
the
state's
contention
that
we
are
not,
but
the
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
the
claim
--
well
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
now
you
--
you
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
you
will
--
you
will
find
in
the
record.
in
the
testimony,
i
testified
in
the
case,
a
--
and
my
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
in
over
half
of
the
grand
jury
since
1951,
there
had
been
one
or
more
negro
serving
actually
on
the
grand
jury.
now,
that
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
as
i
read
it.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that
--
that's
what
he
said,
but
as
i
read
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
it's
not
--
that's
not
true.
you
will
find
a
testimony
of
a
good
many
of
the
witnesses
in
there
that
they
have
seen
varying
numbers
of
negroes,
actually
serving
on
the
grand
jury
of
one,
two,
three
and
four.
there's
no
testimony
of
all
the
four
in
there.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
judge
carter
said
that
he
couldn't
remember.
he
wouldn't
--
he
would
not
commit
himself.
he
said
he
could
remember
one
man
--
one
negro
serving.
he
remembered
his
name,
but
he
would
not
testify
further.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
i'm
saying
he
did
not
testify
that.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that
is
true,
but
the
grand
jury
in
montgomery
county
ordinarily,
the
makeup
of
the
grand
jury
as
published
in
the
paper
and
because
you
would
see
them
as
they're
convinced.you
would
see
him
going
back
and
forward.
now,
the
judge
would
see
him
only
when
he
charges
him
and
when
they
report
in,
because
i
was
in
a
little
better
position
to
testify
on
that
because
i
work
with
the
grand
jury
as
long
as
i
have
ever
been.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
two.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
he
is
the
presiding
judge
of
the
criminal
court
and
would
have
seem,
judge
jones
occasionally
charges
the
grand
jury,
but
not
all
of
them.
actually,
i
will
get
through
the
grand
jury.
as
i
say,
we
had
--
i
had
a
--
i
pointed
out
that
we
get
our
grand
jury
list
and
now
petty
jury
list
from
the
same
box.
there's
no
--
no
distinction.
they
would
come
from
the
same
box.
and
whatever
the
evidence
is
as
to
--
the
petty
jury
would
also
be
as
to
the
grand
jury,
because
it
comes
from
the
same
box.
i
think
that
the
state
showed
in
the
hearing
in
1955
that
we
will
not
discriminate
against
anybody,
that
they
were
looking
for
jurors.
there
were
certainly
no
evidence
and
no
jurors
(inaudible)
token
service
by
negroes
in
montgomery
county.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
they
--
the
board
of
jury
supervisors
testified
that
they
consulted
--
are
you
speaking
of
negro
or
negro
and
white?
mr.
william
f.
thetford
just
generally,
they
--
they
consulted
civic
clubs.
they
testified.
they
had
consulted
naacp,
the
old
civic
(inaudible)
association
of
a
negro
organization
that
they
had
consulted
a
good
many
of
the
negro
leaders
in
montgomery
asking
for
a
list
of
--
of
negroes
who
met
the
qualifications
for
jury
duty
that
are
have
good
--
good,
honest,
intelligent
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
similar
procedure
--
similar
procedure
with
the
white.
they
consult
--
now,
you
have
to
understand
this.
in
montgomery,
we
have
a
good
many
white
organizations
that
have
no
comparable
negro.
in
other
words,
as
montgomery
kiwanis
club,
it's
white.
there
is
no
negro
kiwanis
club.
we
have
to
go
to
possibly
other
sources,
but
they
would
be
equal
sources
and
that
was
their
testimony
that
they
consulted
these
both
individuals
and
societies
and
associations
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes.
i
believe
there
is
testimony
from
one
of
the
jury
commissioners
that
he
had
gotten
the
--
the
voting
--
well,
of
course
they'll
probably
look
at
the
voting
list
anyhow,
that
he
had
gotten
negroes
to
go
down
the
whole
list
and
pick
out
before
him
people
that
they
could
say,
were
honest
and
straight
to
--
to
place
in
the
jury
box.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
they
are
revised
once
a
year
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
--
by
law.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
we
have
the
alabama
state
normal
college
in
montgomery.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
in
montgomery.
it's
a
negro
college.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
it
does.
and
we
also
have
--
well,
kostowski
is
not
in
montgomery
county.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
you
will
find
in
the
record
that
a
teacher
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
at
state
normal,
furnished
mr.
mathews
who
is
clerk
of
the
board,
a
list
of
--
from
30
to
50
names
which
mr.
mathews
said
all
of
them
were
placed
in
the
box.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
two.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
several.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
there's
more
than
one.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
there
is
a
professional
group
of
--
of
course
we
are
possibly
tied
down
because
your
better
educated
negro
almost
always
is
a
professional
man
in
montgomery.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
and
he
is
excused.
so,
we
have
that
problem.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
we
have
businessmen,
we
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
we
--
we
have
businessmen
of
importance
in
montgomery
and
they
serve
on
juries
too.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
sir.
there
isn't
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
because
there
is
no
designation
as
to
white
or
designation
as
to
colored.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
this
--
this
court
has
said
we
can
so
designate
them.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
140,000,
i
believe.
it's
in
that
neighborhood.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
we
have
very
little
examination.
you're
speaking
of
petty
juries
now?
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
sir.
we
don't
get
our
jurist
on
that
--
on
that
basis.
the
jury
--
our
juries
are
selected
in
this
manner.
if
they
are,
say
a
35
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
present.
the
defendant
--
no,
state
strikes
first.
the
defendant
strikes
two.
the
state
strikes
one.
the
defendant
strikes
two
until
we
have
12
names
left
and
that
is
the
jurist
revocation.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
out
of
the
whole
35.
the
whole
35
might
well
be
used.
the
law
requires
--
alabama
procedure
requires
at
least
24.
the
jurors
will
be
there
for
a
non-capital
case
and
30,
a
capital
case.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
we
--
we
have
the
right.both
state
of
all
parties
have
the
right
to
examine
jurors
on
any
particular
thing
if
they
so
desire.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
the
judge
does
it
at
the
request
of
the
lawyers.
it's
done
on
supervision
of
the
court
and
ordinarily
the
judge
--
we
ask
him
to
ask
the
questions
and
he
asked
the
questions
of
the
jurors.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
sir.
i
want
to
make
one
more
observation
then
i'm
--
i'm
leaving
this.
in
1954,
when
the
first
jeremiah
reeves
case
came
before
this
court,
this
same
proposition
of
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
grand
juries
of
montgomery
county
was
both
briefed
and
argued
before
this
court.
the
court
at
that
time
seems
satisfied
with
our
method
of
selecting
jurors
and
seems
satisfied
that
there
was
no
discrimination
being
shown,
negroes,
in
montgomery
county.
the
case
was
not
reversed
on
systematic
exclusion.
it
was
reversed
on
the
remarks
and
the
nature
of
a
confession.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
--
just
as
you
are
pointing
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
--
cases
should
not
be
and
they
have
the
right
to
do
it,
and
you
have
the
right
to
do
it,
but
cases
--
criminal
cases
should
not
be
reversed
piecemeal.
we
of
course
are
bound
by
it
and
will
follow
the
dictates
of
this
court,
but
when
the
case
comes
up
here
and
it's
reversed
on
a
confession,
obviously,
we
think
the
jury's
proposition
has
been
argued,
briefed
to,
and
no
mention
of
it,
is
made
in
this
court's
opinion.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
we
have
a
much
fuller
record
on
this
case
than
we
did
in
the
1954.
the
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
well,
i
think
it's
directed
from
the
state's
standpoint.
it
--
a
great
many
more
people
testified.
we
haven't
in
there
a
large
number
of
lawyers
testified
that
they
had
tried
cases
with
negro
jurors.
now,
this
is
in
the
--
the
present
record.
in
the
first
record,
we
have
only
the
three
witnesses
testified
and
they
testified
simply
that
negroes
were
serving
on
the
juries,
both
grand
jury
and
petty
jury.
the
next
question
that
i
would
like
to
talk
about
is
the
reindictment
and
rearraignment
of
the
defendant
in
--
the
defendant
was
neither
reindicted
nor
rearraigned
after
the
first
reversal.
that
is
standard
--
that
is
alabama
procedure.
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
reindictment.
no
requirement
for
a
rearraignment.
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
alabama,
i
think
follows
a
majority
of
the
states
in
that.
there
are
number
of
various
jurisdictions
which
are
cited
where
alabama
has
a
limitation
on
that
if
your
indictment
is
amended
or
the
man
is
acquitted
of
a
higher
offense
by
being
convicted
of
a
law
then
better
practices
to
reindict,
but
we
don't
require
it.
and
the
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
sir.
that
as
i
say
is
done
in
--
in
most
jurisdictions,
i
believe.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
there
was
not
--
judge
(inaudible)
in
his
opinion,
i'll
have
to
admit
was
in
error.
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
motion
on
the
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
in
1952
challenge.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
i
won't
cover
that.
i
simply
point
out
to
the
court
that
petitioner
makes
a
point
that
--
that
he
should
have
been
reindicted
and
rearraigned
in
--
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
mandate
from
this
court.
it
was
simply
reversed.
that
of
course
is
not
correct.
the
waiting
of
this
court's
judgment
reversed
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
see,
kennedy
versus
alabama
and
(inaudible)
versus
alabama.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
on
the
alabama
practice,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitation
on
any
capital
offense.
now,
the
defendant
in
getting
to
the
grand
--
to
the
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
in
1952,
the
defendant
was
arrested
on
november
10th.
he
was
arraigned
on
november
4th
--
indicted
on
november
the
14th.
he
was
arraigned
on
november
the
15th.
at
the
time
of
he
--
his
arraignment,
he
was
represented
by
counsel
of
his
own
choice,
counsel
that
petitioner
now
freely
admits
was
competent
and
capable
and
exerted
every
effort
in
his
behalf.
on
the
15th
when
he
was
arraigned,
the
--
mr.
(inaudible)
who
then
represented
petitioner
asked
for
a
continuance
of
the
arraignment.
he
stated
no
grounds
for
that
continuance.
he
simply
--
as
we
find
in
the
practice
of
criminal
law,
a
great
many
continuances
are
requested.
he
subsequently
requested
a
continuance
of
the
trial.
it's
--
when
--
then
on
--
now,
alabama
practice
requires
that
a
--
requires
that
an
indictment
be
attacked
by
plea
in
abatement
which
must
be
filed
before
a
plea
to
the
merits.
now,
on
the
15th,
when
he
was
arraigned,
there
was
no
plea
made
to
the
merits.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
none
was
made
that
day.
the
plea
--
wait
a
minute.
i'm
misstating
that.
there
was
no
objection
taken
to
the
indictment.
there
was
no
motion
filed
to
quash
on
arraignment.
he
would
simply
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
he
pled
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
now
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
he
asked
for
a
continuance
without
stating
grounds
for
it
and
he
subsequently
--
and
then
when
that
was
overruled,
he
pled
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
on
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that
--
you
will
not
find
that
in
the
record.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
there
is
a
record.
he
simply
made
a
motion
for
a
continuance.
he
stated
no
grounds
for
it.
on
the
26th,
when
this
case
came
for
trial,
he
then
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
alleging
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
jury.
now,
that
was
11
days
after
he
was
arraigned.
that
motion
was
overruled
and
then
he
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
binary
which
really
gave
him
exactly
the
same
thing
because
our
--
our
grand
jury
and
trial
binary
are
taken
from
the
same
box.
now,
he
abandoned
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
he
did
not
argue
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
his
subsequent
appeal.
he
--
it
was
neither
briefed
it
and
argued
before
this
case
in
1954.
we
meet
again
in
1955
when
we
again
go
to
trial
with
this
defendant,
and
they
then
asked
that
they'd
be
allowed
to
withdraw
their
pleas
to
the
merits
filed
on
november
the
15th,
1952.
the
state
asked
grounds
that
they've
got
different
lawyers
and
that
they
would
like
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
of
constitutional
questions
in
regard
to
grand
jury
which
the
--
actually,
the
motion
that
we
are
now
considering
was
filed
two
and
a
half
years
after
arraignment.
now,
the
--
he
had
his
opportunity.
i
--
i
will
point
this
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
relatively
short
time
between
the
time
mr.
(inaudible)
was
hired.
i
don't
know
when
he
was
hired,
but
it
was
a
day
or
so
before
the
arraignment
of
jeremiah
reeves.
now,
on
the
alabama
practice,
a
one
paragraph
pleading
would
have
been
sufficient
on
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
he
could
have.
there
was
no
insuperable
barrier
to
keep
him
as
--
as
in
(inaudible)
case.
there
was
nothing
to
keep
him
if
he
had
wanted
to
from
filing
that
plea
in
abatement.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
sir.
no,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
would
have
happened
then
was
witnesses
would
have
been
--
the
--
the
whole
idea
is
an
orderly
carrying
forward
of
justice.
they
--
the
law
tries
to
get
these
preliminary
matters
out
of
the
way
before
you
actually,
your
juries
and
your
witnesses
are
subpoenaed
to
--
to
try
the
case.
it
would
have
been
set
in
the
usual
course
of
our
procedure
some
time
during
the
next
week
or
so.
we
had
11
days
before
the
case
was
actually
tried.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes.
now,
that's
what
as
i
say
was
not
filed
under
the
case.
actually,
it
was
called
for
a
trial
on
the
26.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
this
case
was
reversed
in
december
1955
and
we
tried
him
again
in
may.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
1954.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that's
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
the
next
year,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we
find
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
is
--
is
pretty
slow
in
deciding
cases
for
sometimes
a
year
or
so.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
after
it's
--
after
the
trial.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
sir,
they
have.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
take
no
more
time.
we
have
one
other
problem
of
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
let
the
--
as
to
evidence
before
the
--
as
to
where
there
was
evidence
before
the
grand
--
grand
jury,
legally
before
the
grand
jury.
i
don't
think
that's
much
of
a
problem.
i
think
that
costello
answers
it
as
far
as
the
federal
court
is
concerned
and
certainly
our
cases,
hold
that
they
have
no
right
to
inquire
into
what
evidence
was
submitted
to
the
grand
jury
and
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that,
and
i
want
to
give
mr.
stewart
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
that
is
correct.
that
was
apparently
abandoned.
it
was
not
--
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
sir.
it
was
neither
briefed
nor
argued
nor
urged
on
this
court
in
19
--
in
1954,
mr.
william
f.
thetford
no,
sir.
it
was
completely
abandoned
and
did
not
come
back
again
until
the
new
trial
in
may
of
1955.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
what
i
said
was
that
the
same
exact
proposition
was
submitted
in
the
attack
on
the
petty
jury,
because
the
juries
are
drawn
out
of
the
same
box.
mr.
william
f.
thetford
it
would
be
the
same
jury.
