justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what's
your
practice?
does
the
court
draw
a
panel
to
serve
for
a
week
or
two
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
you
tell
us
that
judge
carter,
did
you
say?
testified
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
he
could
remember
not
more
than
one
negro
ever
serving
on
the
panel,
do
you
mean
on
a
panel
of
a
hundred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
does
that
once
a
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
twice
a
year.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
and
i
don't
quite
get
the
significance
of
the
one
negro.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
only
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
all
the
number
of
panels
of
a
hundred
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
--
did
the
judge
remember
what
year
that
was
over
the
last
20
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
bother
to
tell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
method
by
which
the
18
are
selected?
does
the
judge
just
select
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
so
happened
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
that
over
21
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
there
had
been
this
process
followed
and
in
the
hat
would
be
a
number
of
names
of
negroes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not
admit
that,
i
see.
in
any
event,
only
one
negro
over
the
21
years
ever
had
his
name
drawn
from
the
hat,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean
that
if
the
--
if
the
hundred
every
time,
you
never
had
a
panel
that
had
more
than
10
negroes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
names,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
practice
in
montgomery,
mr.
hall?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
birmingham.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
idea
was
that
the
confession
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
has
been
thrown
out
by
the
previous
decision
was
gained
by
bringing
him
in
alongside
the
electric
chair
and
telling
him
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see.
he
made
the
plea,
you
tell
us
because
he
was
denied
a
continuance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
he
sought
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
making
an
attack
in
the
indictment,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
was
actually
indicted
on
the
14th,
the
same
say
he
first
saw
his
mother.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
at
most,
it
had
to
be
within
24-hours.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
did
i
understand
you
to
say
earlier
that
--
does
the
record
show
that
his
mother
had
retained
a
lawyer
who
had
tried
to
see
him
between
the
10th
and
14th
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
between
the
10th
and
the
14th.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
ground
that
you're
out
of
time,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
it
appear
why
--
are
the
reasons
stated
why
the
motion
to
quash
was
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
the
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
at
page
19,
additional
judgment
and
pleadings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
18?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
of
the
proceedings
which
led
up
to
those
judgments
anywhere?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apparently,
the
state
objected
to
the
motion
on
single
ground,
wasn't
it,
that
it
came
too
late?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
right
that
he
says
nothing,
but
i
notice
that
the
solicitor
for
the
state,
the
top
of
page
207
states
his
reasons
for
objecting
that
it
comes
too
late.
now,
the
trial
judge
says
--
he
says
“considered
opinion
that
the
motion
should
be
denied”.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
evidence
as
to
the
sources
from
which
the
names
are
examined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
generally,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
a
--
a
similar
procedure
including
white
names?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
reliance
on
voting
lists
or
other
public
lists
of
that
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
often
are
those
lists
assembled?
are
they
done
periodically
or
annually
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
once
a
year.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
present.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
thetford,
is
there
a
statute
of
limitations
on
this
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
thetford,
did
i
misunderstand
mr.
hall?
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
that
he
asked
the
continuance
in
order
that
he
might
make
a
motion
to
attack
the
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
a
record
of
what
occurred
at
