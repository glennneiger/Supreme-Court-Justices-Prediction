mr.
peter
a.
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
argument
would
be
a
divided
one.
i
will
make
a
few
of
this
statement,
my
colleague
mr.
billingsley
will
speak
in
rebuttal.
this
particular
case
is
here
in
this
court
the
second
time.
some
time
ago,
back
in
1952,
petitioner,
a
young
negro
boy,
age
16,
is
arrested
in
montgomery,
alabama
and
was
held
three
to
four
days
in
jail
and
imprisoned
(inaudible)
question.
after
that
time,
he
was
then
indicted.on
the
next
day,
he
was
arraigned,
charged
with
rape
and
subsequent
to
that,
two
days
later
he
was
tried,
convicted
of
the
crime
of
rape
sentenced
to
the
electric
chair.on
that
occasion
back
in
1952,
his
counsel
was
(inaudible),
i
believe.
i
don't
recall
exactly
what
their
exact
name
but
he
did
not
have
the
same
counsel
as
now.
on
the
day
of
the
arraignment
--
i
beg
your
pardon.he
was
arrested
on
november
10.
he
was
indicted
on
november
14th,
1952.
now,
from
the
10th
to
the
14th
of
november,
he
was
kept
incommunicado
in
the
city
jail
of
montgomery
and
at
kilby
prison.
he
was
not
allowed
to
talk
with
his
parents
or
to
have
counsel
or
have
been
into
the
counsel.on
the
14th
of
november,
he
was
indicted
by
grand
jury
of
montgomery
--
in
montgomery
county
alabama.
now,
on
the
very
next
day,
on
november
15th,
he
was
arraigned
some
time
between
november
15
--
november
14th
and
november
15th
term
of
arraignment,
counsel
wasn't
good
for
him.
on
the
arraignment,
his
then
counsel
asked
for
a
continuance
in
order
to
(inaudible)
which
request
was
abused.
subsequently,
on
the
17th
of
november
1952,
after
arraignment,
he
was
shared
with
the
copy
of
the
indictment
and
a
list
of
the
merit
which
has
been
drawn
especially
on
the
day
of
arraignment.
on
the
trial
of
the
cause,
his
counsel
sought
to
withdraw
pleas,
end
it
on
arraignment,
pleas
to
demerits
in
order
that
he
might
attack
the
indictment
on
constitutional
grounds.
that
request
was
overruled.
all
of
this
is
supplied
at
the
record.
it
appears
in
the
record.
the
trial
then
went
ahead
to
a
conclusion
at
which
time
reeves
is
convicted
as
i've
said
before
of
rape.
this
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
subsequently,
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
after
a
hearing,
the
alabama
court
which
has
raised
a
reversal
which
is
without
directions,
kennedy
against
alabama
and
(inaudible)
against
alabama
was
cited,
subsequently,
the
state
of
alabama
against
jeremiah
reeves.
there's
no
trial
in
1955.
on
this
particular
trial,
there
is
no
reindictment
of
the
arraignment.
counsel
for
the
defendant
on
the
petitioner
at
that
time
again
moved
the
court
--
moved
the
court
for
permission
to
withdraw
please
in
it
on
his
previous
arraignment
in
1952
for
the
purpose
of
attack,
the
validity
of
this
indictment
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
we
have
specifically
two
grounds
which
we
desire
to
explore.
one
was
the
fact
that
under
the
reversal
of
this
honorable
court
in
the
previous
case,
in
the
citation
of
the
two
cases,
kennedy
against
alabama
and
vermont
against
alabama.
it
was
our
conclusion
that
certain
culprit
statements
and
confessions
introduced
on
the
previous
trial
could
not
that
--
that
because
of
those
culprit
statements
and
those
confessions,
the
conviction
could
not
stand
and
it
was
our
conviction
and
our
argument
and
the
effort
to
attack
the
indictment
this
time,
that
the
only
thing
before
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
reeves
was
in
fact
the
statements
and
the
confessions
which
had
been
thrown
out
and
without
this,
the
indictment
could
not
stand.
secondly,
it
was
on
the
confession
that
the
grand
jury,
which
indicted
petitioner
contained
absolutely
no
negroes
and
that
the
system
of
the
state
of
alabama
of
throwing
members
of
such
grand
jury
said
at
that
time
was
designed
to
exclude
members
or
to
discriminate
against
them
by
reason
of
their
race
and
color
then
tried
to
the
provisions
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
trial
court
without
a
hearing
overruled
our
motions.
we
then
filed
a
motion
to
strike
within
our
drawn
to
hear
this
particular
case
because
of
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
juries
in
alabama.
the
trial
court
set
this
motion
down
for
a
hearing
and
on
the
hearing,
it
appeared
that
the
commissioners,
the
jury
commissioners
of
montgomery
county
at
a
system
of
selecting
persons
for
the
jury
absolutely
contrary
to
the
system
laid
down
by
the
alabama
court
and
the
testimony
in
fact
of
the
commissioners
showed
that
they
had
very
little
system
indeed
for
the
selection
of
negroes,
although
they
contended
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
judge
eugene
carter,
the
circuit
judge
of
the
county
who
testified
that
he
--
members
of
the
board
of
jury
commissioners
had
been
for
27
years
--
some
years
said
that
his
method
was
to
interview
some
negroes
whom
he
knew,
who
suggested
names
for
the
--
for
the
panel.
but
as
to
identify
anyone
of
such
persons,
he
refused
because
he
said
it
might
embarrass
him.
we
asked
him
to
identify
anyone
particular
negro
who
might
be
on
the
panel
jury
there
at
montgomery
county.
he
refused
to
do
that.
he
also
testified
that
he
had
drawn
the
grand
jury
in
montgomery
county
for
the
past
21
years
that
he
remembered
one
negro
and
he
said
on
a
grand
jury,
but
could
not
remember
as
many
as
two
during
that
period.
i
also
testified
that
up
until
the
past
one
or
two
years,
it
had
been
very
difficult
to
get
negroes
for
service
on
the
jury
and
that
up
until
the
past
one
or
two
years,
very
few
negroes
had
served.
judge
eugene
jones,
the
circuit
clerk,
mr.
mathews
who
also
served
on
the
jury
commission,
both
testified
similarly.
their
methods
of
selecting
negroes
at
the
same
manner
through
personal
acquaintance
by
contact
of
various
clubs
and
organizations,
but
none
of
them
could
designate
or
would
designate
a
particular
club
or
organization
except
for
the
naacp
and
the
local
(inaudible).
nor
could
we
get
from
any
of
them,
particular
names
of
individuals
that
they
knew
to
be
on
the
jury
role
of
montgomery
county
are
listed
on
the
jury
courts
of
that
county.
incidentally,
we
ask
the
court
for
permission
to
have
the
jury
role
examined
by
any
of
these
particular
witnesses
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
or
no
any
particular
name
on
such
role
could
be
identified
by
these
witnesses
who
was
certainly
on
a
position
to
know
as
negroes.
the
court
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
know.
we
asked
the
circuit
court
clerk
who
was
also
the
clerk
of
the
jury
commission
and
as
to
what
the
size
of
the
--
the
jury
panel
was
or
the
role.
you
mean
the
entire
role?
mr.
peter
a.
hall
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.i
think
i
misunderstood
you.
the
panel
is
usually
(inaudible)
of
the
trial
of
any
--
of
any
one
term.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
no,
sir.
perhaps,
i
should
--
allow
me
to
try
to
explain
this,
the
panel
--
the
jury
panel
drawn
for
service
for
a
term
is
around
a
hundred
persons.
a
hundred
persons
is
enough.
the
number
of
persons
who
served
on
a
grand
jury
is
18
persons.
now,
out
of
the
panel
of
a
hundred,
they
draw
--
they
draw
petty
juries
and
a
grand
jury.
now,
from
this
panel
of
100
persons,
judge
carter,
who
draws
most
of
this
--
of
the
grand
juries
will
then
take
these
100
names,
put
them
in
their
hat.
they
throw
them
through
the
hat
and
draw
from
that
hat
18
new
service
grand
jurors.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
he
does
that
twice
a
year.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
over
a
period
of
21
years
that
he
has
enjoined
such
grand
juries
in
montgomery
county,
alabama,
he
remembered
one
negro
having
served
on
a
grand
jury.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
only
one
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
--
in
21
years.
that
was
his
testimony.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
it
was
the
hearing
not
on
the
motion
to
push
the
indictment
mr.
justice,
but
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
question
the
jury
drawn
to
hear
this
particular
case.that
is
where
this
testimony
came
up.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
no,
sir.
he
didn't.
i
don't
recall
it.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
that
is
true,
your
honor.
that
is
true
but
this
was
the
petty
jury.
now
there
had
been.
there
was
testimony
from
the
bar.
we
questioned
the
members
of
the
bar
of
montgomery
county,
several
of
them
and
that
was
a
considerable
testimony
to
the
extent
that
several
negroes
had
been
on
jury
panels
in
previous
years.
but
to
have
negroes
actually
serve
on
juries
was
another
thing.
that
was
the
testimony.there
were
eight
on
this
panel
of
100
persons.
i
have
--
none
served
on
this
jury
and
none
served
on
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
it.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
they
were
called
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
now,
getting
back
to
the
--
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
asked
me.
judge
carter
testified
that
he
had
known
one
negro
to
serve
on
a
grand
jury
in
21
years,
only
one.
now,
he
had
--
he
had
drawn
most
of
these
grand
juries
and
addressed
most
of
them.
our
contention
made
by
way
of
motion
was
that
negroes
did
not
served
through
some
design,
either
because
they
were
lift
off
of
the
jury
rules
all
together
or
somewhere
between
the
time
of
placing
them
on
the
roles
and
getting
them
to
serve
by
reason
of
some
design
of
the
state
of
alabama,
they
never
got
on
a
grand
jury.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
oh
sure.
they
are
put
in
a
hat
--
handkerchief
put
over
the
hat,
placed
over
the
hat.
i
believe
that's
correct
from
the
solicitor
of
montgomery
county
here
and
he
draws
them
out.
there
is
no
contention
on
the
part
of
petitioner
that
the
judge
has
a
method
of
knowing
which
are
negroes
or
which
are
white.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
but
he
does
draw
them
out
of
the
hat
from
under
the
handkerchief.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
well,
no,
sir,
we
do
not
admit
that.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
according
to
the
testimony
of
judge
carter.
now,
judge
carter
remembered
positively
one
negro
serving,
but
he
could
not
remember
as
many
as
two
or
four
serving
according
to
his
testimony.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
was
argued
extensively.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir,
of
course.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
that
is
one
reason,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
the
other
reason
we
attack
the
indictment
was
because
our
contention
is
that
there
was
no
sufficient
legal
evidence
before
such
grand
jury
as
is
required
by
a
statute
of
the
state
of
alabama
on
which
they
could
base
the
indictment.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
we
did
challenge
that,
sir.
we
had
a
hearing
on
this,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
we
set
out
in
our
motion
for
pushing
the
petty
jury,
call
to
hear
this
case
the
fact
that
the
negro
population
of
montgomery
county,
alabama
constitutes
something
like
40%
from
the
total
population
of
the
county.
they
contended
in
that
motion
that
from
nothing
to
no
more
than
10%
that
no
jury
--
put
it
this
way,
sir.
no
jury
ever
was
composed
of
more
than
10%
no
panel
or
the
jury
role
itself
did
not
contain
the
names
of
more
than
10%
of
its
total
makeup
over
negroes.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
never
had
that
more
than
10
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
now,
in
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
i
--
yes,
sir,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
we
must
admit
that
negroes
have
served
on
petty
juries.
i
have
seen
them
serve
in
montgomery
county
in
recent
years.
however,
one
of
our
main
contentions
is
that
jeremiah
reeves
was
arrested
and
indicted
in
1952
and
as
judge
eugene
carter
says,
“until
recent
years,
they
have
had
very
few
negroes
on
the
jury.
and
in
1952,
i
don't
believe
they
had
any.”
in
1955,
i
have
to
reflect
that
negroes
are
serving
on
petty
juries
in
montgomery
county,
alabama.
now
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
know
of
any
negro
who
has
served
on
a
grand
jury
in
montgomery
county
at
any
time.
on
this
hearing,
we
questioned
several
negroes
and
leaders
there
in
the
city
of
montgomery,
well
educated
persons,
persons
with
position
and
none
of
them
knew
of
any
negroes
who
had
served
on
a
grand
jury.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
i
am
in
birmingham,
mr.
justice.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
but
i
have
also
practiced
in
montgomery
and
all
of
the
state
of
alabama.
i
have
seen,
however,
in
the
city
of
montgomery,
alabama
as
many
as
three
or
four
negroes
on
petty
jury
in
recent
years.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
i
couldn't
be
sure,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
possibly
so,
but
that
has
been
in
recent
years.
i
must
stress
that.
there
has
been
a
change
and
our
contention
is
that
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
jeremiah
reeves
in
1952
was
made
up
under
that
whole
system
which
of
course
has
changed
recently
and
that
at
that
time,
it
was
greatly
wrong
and
deprived
the
rights
guaranteed
him
by
united
states
constitution
and
that,
the
system
by
which
they
selected
persons
to
serve
was
designed
to
discriminate
against
negroes
because
of
their
race.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
alabama
law
requires
that
the
composition
of
a
grand
jury
can
be
attacked
only
by
a
plea
in
abatement
and
that
such
plea
must
be
made
in
any
case
before
arraignment.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
in
1952,
sir,
as
we
try
to
outline
to
begin
with,
jeremiah
reeves
is
arrested
on
november
10th,
1952.
he
was
kept
in
the
montgomery
city
jail
for
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
he
was
kept
in
the
montgomery
city
jail
four
or
five
hours
where
he
was
questioned
intensively.
this
record,
the
previous
record
will
show
that.
he
was
then
taken
from
the
city
jail
to
kilby
prison,
a
penitentiary
where
the
record
said
and
where
the
testimony
was
to
be
effective
that
he
was
placed
in
the
electric
chair
and
some
other
things
and
kept
there
from
november
10th
to
november
14th.
but
this
was
--
we're
not
urging
this,
mr.
justice
whittaker
but
in
order
to
make
the
point
that
he
did
meet
the
requirement.
he
was
taken
to
montgomery
city
jail
to
kilby
prison
where
he
was
kept
from
november
10th
to
november
14th.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
whether
in
this
confession
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
that
was
the
confession
on
the
previous
trial.
at
least
he
was
queried
intensively.
he
was
kept
incommunicado.
we
urged
on
the
previous
hearing
that
he
was
threatened.
from
the
10th
to
the
14th,
he
was
not
allowed
to
see
his
parents
to
have
counsel
or
to
see
anyone.
on
the
14th,
allegedly,
he
had
made
certain
statements
and
has
made
certain
confessions.
now,
on
that
same
day,
he
was
allowed
to
see
his
mother
for
the
first
time.but
on
that
same
day,
he
was
indicted
by
the
montgomery
county
grand
jury.
now,
he
--
on
the
next
day,
the
15th,
he
was
arraigned.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
he
had
counsel
on
that
day.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
he
--
and
that,
we
do
not
know,
sir.
we
were
not
the
counsel
for
him
at
that
time,
but
this
--
the
man
that
he
had
as
his
lawyer
at
that
time
and
tried
to
see
him
at
kilby
prison
and
according
to
the
record
on
the
first
trial
--
on
the
first
trial
had
been
refused,
admitted.
so,
he
had
no
chance
to
confer
with.we
would
like
to
also
point
out
the
fact
that
on
the
15th,
when
he
was
arraigned,
he
had
not
been
served
of
the
copy
of
his
indictment
nor
did
he
know
who
the
members
of
the
grand
jury
that
had
indicted
him
were.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
motion
to
quash?
mr.
peter
a.
hall
it
came
too
late
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
mr.
counsel,
may
i
attempt
to
make
this
point
a
little
clearer?
counsel
for
petitioner
on
the
first
hearing,
on
the
day
of
arraignment,
requested
a
continuance
from
the
trial
court
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
up
motions
going
towards
an
attack
on
the
indictment.
the
trial
court
refused
that
continuance.
he
was
required
to
plead.
at
that
time,
they
made
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
now,
that
was
in
1952.
subsequent
to
that,
he
again
attempted
to
attack
the
indictment
and
the
trial
court
held
that
the
attack
came
too
late
in
as
much
as
he
had
already
made
a
plea
to
the
merits.
on
this
hearing
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
reeves
had
been
indicted
on
the
14th.
he
was
arraigned
on
the
15th
and
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
he
was
required
to
plea.
he
asked
for
continuance,
the
judge
says
no
so
he
had
plea.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
on
the
same
month.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
he
was
not
allowed
to
see
anyone
until
the
14th
and
afterwards,
so
it
had
to
be
the
14th,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
please
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
have
here
somewhere
in
the
brief.
on
page

--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
--
of
--
of
petitioners
brief
under
(1),
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
we
set
out
some
of
this.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
we
set
out
at
the
last
paragraph.
he
was
taken
from
the
county
jail,
situated
in
the
city
of
montgomery,
alabama
where
he
was
kept
five
or
six
minutes
and
then
taken
immediately
to
kilby
prison,
the
state
penitentiary,
situated
in
the
same
county
where
he
was
put
in
the
test
cell,
questioned
and
threatened
without
advise
of
counsel
and
not
allowed
to
see
his
parents
from
monday,
november
10th
until
the
afternoon
of
thursday,
november
14th
after
he
had
made
certain
admissions
and
culprit
statements
when
his
mother
was
allowed
to
see
him.
i
don't
know
if
counsel
was
allowed
to
see
him
that
afternoon
or
the
morning
of
the
15th,
but
i
know
he
saw
no
one
until
the
afternoon
of
november
14th
and
he
was
required
to
plea
on
trial
for
his
life
on
the
morning
of
november
15th.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir
the
same
day.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
the
record
of
previous
hearing,
in
the
record
of
the
previous
hearing
shows
that
some
attorney,
mr.
(inaudible)
i
believe
attempted
to
see
him
at
kilby
prison.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
between
the
10th
and
the
14th
and
was
to
--
there
is
some
contention.
we
don't
have
it
in
this
record.
we
didn't
go
into
that
issue.
on
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
for
the
motion
for
continuance,
mr.
justice
clark?
mr.
peter
a.
hall
i
don't
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
i
am
not
sure
of
that
contention,
mr.
justice
clark,
but
somewhere
in
the
record,
there
is
a
suggestion.
i
don't
know
if
it's
in
this
record,
previous
record
because
we
argued
the
same
point
on
the
cause
that
came
up
before.
i
believe
in
that
record
and
on
that
brief,
we
set
out
the
counsel
and
--
and
indicated
the
place
in
the
record
where
it
was
that
counsel
wanted
to
make
a
motion
or
i
didn't
make
a
motion
for
continuance
for
the
purpose
that
argued
on
his
motion
for
continuance
that
he
wanted
to
attack
the
indictment
and
go
into
that,
but
they
refused
to
grant
him
continuance
or
he
wanted
to
study
the
matter.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
he
made
a
motion
to
quash
subsequent
to
his
plea
on
the
arraignment.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
mr.
justice
clark,
he
also
suggested
that
he
subsequently
on
the
trial
made
a
motion
to
quash,
i
believe.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
on
the
13th,
yes
sir,
but
that
was
after
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
--
the
arraignment
and
everything
else,
but
he
actually
made
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
and
the
trial
court
held
then
that
he
came
too
late.
he
had
already
pleaded.
on
the
previous
hearing,
in
this
honorable
court,
it
is
our
understanding
that
the
reversal
was
predicated
on
the
commission
and
the
evidence
of
an
illegal
confession
or
certain
statements
made
by
petitioner
alleged
to
it
and
made
by
the
petitioner.
the
record
of
the
previous
file
indicates
that
no
written
confession
was
introduced
into
evidence
or
read
to
the
jury,
but
that
certain
words
or
certain
statements
alleged
to
have
been
made
to
the
prosecuting
witness,
mrs.
(inaudible),
and
to
a
state
official
were
repeated
for
the
benefit
of
the
jury
or
went
to
the
jury.
on
the
second
trial,
no
confession
was
read
to
the
jury
nor
did
mrs.
(inaudible)
this
time
repeat
verbatim
what
had
been
said
to
her
previously,
but
she
admitted
on
the
stand
that
at
the
time
she
allegedly
identified
petitioner
on
november
12,
the
state
is
important.
before
she
viewed
him
through
a
one-way
window
as
he
stood
alone
in
a
cell,
it's
either
the
city
or
county
jail
that
she
had
been
given
a
statement
by
a
police
official
which
indicated
that
the
man
which
she
was
looking
at
had
confessed
to
the
crime.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
yes,
sir.
they
referred
to
(inaudible).
now,
the
state
is
under
the
assumption
that
they
did
not
introduce
a
confession.
our
contention
is
that
if
it
was
ever
introduced,
it
was
introduced
this
time
too,
because
a
prosecuting
witness
indicates
from
everything
she
says
and
from
her
actions
and
the
fact
that
she
had
to
talk
with
the
man.
she
looked
at
him
through
a
one
way
window.she
did
not
have
to
go
into
the
cell.
she
had
to
go
in
and
talk
to
him.
she
saw
the
statement
before
she
went
in
and
then
she
still
had
to
go
in
and
talk
to
him
and
have
a
conversation
with
him
before
she
could
come
out
and
say
she's
identified.
but
her
entire
identification
was
based
upon
that
culprit
statement
or
whatever
that
confession
was.
the
state
certainly
don't
have
to
introduce
it
into
evidence,
only
by
introducing
her
and
letting
her
point
the
finger
on
the
petitioner
and
identifying
him.
the
state's
whole
case
is
grounded
upon
the
identification
of
the
prosecuting
witness
and
the
corroborating
testimony
of
one
witness
called
--
his
name
is
clark
who
allegedly
picked
up
a
colored
boy
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
neighborhood
where
this
crime
took
place
on
the
day
in
question.
and
this
man,
this
witness
that
remember
everything
in
the
world
about
petitioner,
but
he
couldn't
even
remember
the
day
he
talked
to
him
in
prison.
and
he
--
and
the
record
of
the
previous
hearing,
again,
this
hearing
will
show
that
he
could
identify
him
until
he
talk
to
him,
so
whatever
admissions
were
made
for
the
basis
of
his
identification.
assuming
that
we
had
been
allowed
on
a
proper
hearing
to
question
those
people,
those
persons
who
must
have
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
as
much
as
the
state's
whole
case
rested
up
on
that
identification,
if
we
could
have
shown
that
the
indictment
was
granted
upon
these
illegal
admissions,
then
it
seems
to
me
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
under
the
federal
constitution
decision
and
under
the
law
of
alabama
which
is
clearly
set
out
in
our
statute
and
in
here
looking
at
the
state
where
the
supreme
court
is
held
that
were
--
the
legality
of
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
when
it's
brought
up
on
a
motion
to
quash
must
be
decided
by
the
trial
court
before
they
can
go
on
to
hear
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
no,
sir.
the
state
brought
up
costello
and
while
we
didn't
discuss
it,
we
didn't
take
issue
there.
it
seems
to
us
that
costello
appears
sort
of
different
situation
and
as
much
as
it's
a
criminal
case
to
those
in
the
federal
courts
and
costello
is
relying
upon
the
fifth
amendment
and
whatever
rights
he
might
have
under
the
fifth
amendment.
it
was
his
contention
that
if
the
fifth
amendment
guaranteed
him
nothing
that
this
court
should
setout
certain
rules
by
which
grand
jury
should
go
before
and
bringing
in
an
indictment.
the
court,
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
guaranteed
him
nothing
only
that
--
all
the
murders
and
infamous
trials
should
begin
by
indictments
are
presented.
and
in
a
review
of
the
grand
jury
system,
he
pointed
out
that
they've
been
more
or
less
left
on
their
own.
however,
we
are
relying
upon
an
alabama
statute
which
says
that
only
legal
evidence
can
go
to
grand
jury.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
they
didn't
say
the
statute
was
set
aside,
sir.
they
absolutely
refused
to
give
us
a
hearing
on
our
motion.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
on
the
grounds
that
we
--
that
there
was
no
merit
(inaudible),
sir.
they
absolutely
refused
to
give
us
a
hearing
on
our
motion.
i
don't
know
what
the
--
i
don't
recall
exactly
what
the
court
held.
but
in
addition
to
that
--
that
statute
incidentally
while
i
check
this,
we
had
an
alabama
case
to
back
our
position
up
and
that
was
the
hill
case
which
we
just
mentioned
and
which
we
cite
in
the
brief,
hill
against
state
20
alabama
(inaudible)
which
was
a
--
a
conviction
for
a
liquor
law
violation
where
the
defendant
alleged
the
grand
jury
which
returned
the
indictment.
it
has
no
legal
evidence
before
it
and
that
the
indictment
should
be
quashed.
the
trial
court
overruled
it
and
went
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
a
merit
in
his
contention
and
that
the
--
that
the
motion
presented
an
issue
of
fact
to
be
determined
by
the
trial
court
before
the
defendant
could
be
required
to
plea
on
the
merits.
but
in
this
particular
case
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
would
not
--
mr.
peter
a.
hall
no,
sir.
the
trial
court
gave
no
reason.
they
just
overruled
on
this.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
find
it
for
me.
would
you
allow
him
to
find
(inaudible)?
record
18
and
record
207.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
18.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
on
the
record,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
on
page
207
of
the
record,
motion
to
quash
indictment
(inaudible)
on
page
207
of
the
proceeding,
sir.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
the
state
objected,
your
honor.
i
--
i
recall
the
trial
court
giving
no
reason
they
overruling
the
motion
and
we
took
exception.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
that's
right.
mr.
peter
a.
hall
that's
right.
if
your
honors
please,
i'm
don't
want
to
take
all
of
the
time.
we
have
this
divided
time
but
we
have
another
argument
which
we
wanted
to
present,
another
point.
the
petitioner
understands
that
an
ordinary
circumstances,
it's
unnecessary
to
re-indict,
to
re-arraign
a
man
simply
because
--
because
it's
been
reversed
on
appeal.
usually,
the
error,
if
it
appears,
is
some
error
which
goes
on
the
trial
of
the
cause,
an
error
in
ruling
on
the
part
of
the
court,
errors
of
otherwise.
but
in
this
particular
cause,
we
think
it
is
particularly
urgent
and
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
trial
court's
refusal
to
allow
petitioner
to
withdraw
his
pleas
previously
in
it,
which
petitioner
asked
first
before
attacking
the
court's
position
and
asking
for
reindictment
and
rearraignment.
petitioner
asked
that
he
be
allowed
to
withdraw
his
pleas
in
it
at
his
previous
arraignment
in
order
that
he
might
attack
the
legality
of
his
indictment.
the
trial
court
absolutely
refused
to
allow
him
to
withdraw
his
pleas.
now,
it
is
admitted
by
petitioner
that
the
trial
court
had
discretion
to
refuse
or
to
grant
that
request
to
withdraw
pleas.
but
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances,
his
refusal
to
allow
to
withdraw
was
arbitrary
to
the
extent
that
it
was
--
it's
a
revisable
error
and
that
it
did
deny
the
defendant,
a
very
substantial
right
guaranteed
him
by
these
laws
of
alabama
and
by
the
federal
laws.
thank
you
very
much.
