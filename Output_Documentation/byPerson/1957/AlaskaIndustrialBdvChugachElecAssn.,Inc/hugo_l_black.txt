the

shall
be
in
addition
to
the
amount
to
which

us
here?
justice

when

that
they

be
an
addition

justice

theretofore
pay.
justice

well
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
(inaudible)
decided
where
they
do
not
need
when
they
say
in
addition
to
--
how
can
you
justify
the
fact
that
he
gets
$8100
in
addition
to
the
other,
if
they
are
separate,
why
aren't
they
separate?
why
would
the
dna,
why
would
the
company
not
be
entitled
to
get
its
deduction
$3100?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
feel
to
you
know
how
(inaudible),
are
there
any
states
opposition
however,
if
you
have
to
decide
through
the
same
language
and
had
a
huge
temporary
disability,
statements
about
the
admission
the
payments
or
be
an
addition
to
the
amount,
if
so
what
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i
am
interested
in
is
i
think
it
would
be
quite
different
as
the
general
(inaudible)
statement
has
understood,
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
any
other
state
statute
that
has
that
precise
language,
if
you
know
that.
justice
hugo
l.

one
other
question,
how
did
despite
this
fund,
do
they
have
insurance
industrial
fund
and
the
next
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise
the
fund
is
administered
by
the
sate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
no,
there
is
no
fund
--
no
fund
administrated
by
the
state
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
involved
in
an
assumption
to
accept
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
an
educated
man
capable
of
being
manager
or
official
ever
going
earn

more
money

got
one
leg
and
arm
cut
off.
i
am
not
talking
about
legislature
having
the
right
to
speak
