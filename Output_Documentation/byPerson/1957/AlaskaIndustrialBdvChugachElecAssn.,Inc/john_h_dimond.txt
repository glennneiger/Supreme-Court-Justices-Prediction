mr.
john
h.
dimond
may
it
please
the
court?
this
case
rises
under
the
alaska
workmen's
compensation
statute.
in
september
1951,
the
petitioner
carl
jenkins
while
in
the
course
of
his
employment
with
chugach
electric
association
got
a
1200
volt
arc
into
his
arm
on
the
high
power
line,
and
it
exploded
out
both
his
feet.
within
one
month
following
this
accident,
three
amputations
had
been
performed
because
of
the
electrical
burning.
the
left
arm
had
been
amputated
near
the
shoulder,
the
right
leg
below
the
knee,
and
four
toes
of
the
left
foot.
within
one
year
after
the
accident,
the
medical
reports
in
the
record
show
that
jenkins
had
been
fitted
with
artificial
limbs.
he
had
an
artificial
left
arm
and
artificial
right
leg
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
injury
to
the
left
foot
where
four
toes
were
amputated.
he
could
have
sought
and
probably
obtain
some
type
of
employment.
but,
the
left
foot
failed
to
heal
and
this
failure
continued
on
for
a
period
of
over
three
years.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
before
the
industrial
board
and
when
this
case
went
to
the
district
court,
the
evidence
showed
even
then
in
december
1953
that
the
foot
had
not
healed.
if
the
case
were
remanded
to
the
board,
i
suspect
that
a
finding
could
be
made
now
that
healing
process
was
completed
in
1954,
early
part
of
1955.
now,
right
after
his
injury,
the
insurance
carrier
commenced
paying
jenkins
what
they
called
temporary
compensation
specifically
provided
under
the
alaska
statute.
that
statute
provides
that
for
all
injuries
causing
temporary
disability,
the
injured
employee
shall
be
paid
65%
of
his
daily
average
wages
during
the
period
of
the
disability,
and
that
has
always
been
construed
by
the
industrial
board
and
by
alaska
courts
as
meaning
that
he
gets,
during
the
healing
period
until
his
wages,
i
mean
until
his
injuries
have
stabilized
or
have
been
healed,
65%
of
his
average
wages
whatever
the
board
finds
him
to
be,
and
in
the
average
case
at
the
end
of
that
healing
period,
if
there's
any
permanent
injury,
the
industrial
board
makes
a
finding
of
what
percentage
permanent
injuries
involved
and
also
gives
employee
an
additional
award
under
the
permanent
injury
schedule
of
the
alaska
act.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
i
think
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
sir?
mr.
john
h.
dimond
it's
a
lump
sum,
it's
not
related
to
wages,
it
has
no
relation
--
it's
not
computed
on
wages.
a
man
might
for
example
your
honor,
a
man
might
lose
the
hearing
in
both
ears
and
receive
the
maximum
award
for
total
and
permanent
disability
and
yet
he
might
go
back
to
employment
and
earn
just
as
much
as
he
did
before,
so
it's
not
related
directly
at
least
to
loss
of
wages.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
it
was
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
i
don't
think
you
have
to
determine
that
issue
your
honor,
no.
the
only
issue
i
think
the
court
has
to
determine
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
when
a
man
has
received
the
maximum
permanent
award
that
he
has
conclusively
presumed
not
to
have
any
further
or
remaining
earning
capacity.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
the
case
in
a
nutshell
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
it's
based
on
the
construction
of
those
two
provisions
of
the
act;
the
permanent
scheduled
award
section
and
the
temporary
compensation
section.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes,
after
the
left
arm
and
right
leg
had
been
fitted
with
artificial
limbs,
he
couldn't
go
back
to
work
because
the
left
foot
wouldn't
heal.
there
was
an
ulceration
and
all
kinds
of
trouble
there,
causing
by
electrical
burns
and
the
doctors
said
they
have
to
do
further
amputations,
and
skin
grafts
and
plastic
repairs
and
so
on.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
exactly
our
position
your
honor
that
he
had
some
remaining
earning
capacity
after
he
got
his
artificial
limbs.
that
earning
capacity
was
temporarily
impaired
by
an
injury
to
a
left
foot
which
just
happened
to
happen
with
the
same
accident.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
precisely
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
generally
your
honor,
the
industrial
board
i
think
almost
in
every
case
does
not
decide
what
degree
of
permanent
injury
had
been
incurred
until
after
the
healing
period
is
over,
and
the
man
has
returned
to
work
or
until
the
doctors
say
there's
nothing
further
we
can
do
with
you.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
i
don't
think
it's
ever
--
i
did
mention
your
honor
that
it's
been
the
practice
of
the
board
and
the
courts,
i
don't
think
that
question
has
ever
come
up
as
an
issue
in
a
case
as
to
whether
that
was
proper,
i
think
that
(inaudible).
the
act
says
that
for
all
injuries
and
i
emphasize
the
word
all
causing
temporary
disability,
there
shall
be
paid
during
the
period
of
the
disability
and
i
contend
that
the
period
of
the
disability
is
the
entire
period
and
not
just
the
period
preceding
the
amputations
of
two
limbs.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well
your
honor,
the
respondents
took
this
position.
they
paid
him
temporary
compensation
from
the
date
of
injury
until
july
1951,
about
a
year
later,
and
i
think
they
finally
looked
at
the
law
and
said
that
this
man
lost
an
arm
and
a
leg,
therefore
he
is
totally
and
permanent
disabled,
we've
been
paying
him
too
much.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
of
the
amputation
they
contend
that
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled,
and
therefore,
he
couldn't
get
any
temporary
disability.
they
thought
those
two
things
were
inconsistent.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
they
paid
him
$8100
maximum
less
the
amount
they
have
paid
him
for
temporary
disability
for
the
preceding
38
weeks.
so
the
total
â€“
excuse
me?
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
your
honor,
the
statute
on
page
6
of
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
in
the
appendix,
that's
roman
numeral
6,
the
loss
of
both
hands
or
both
arms
or
both
feet
or
both
legs
and
so
on
shall
constitute
total
and
permanent
disability
and
be
compensated
according
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
with
reference
to
total
and
permanent
disability.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
sir.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
and
as
much
as
the
insurance
carrier
had
voluntarily
paid
this
temporary
disability
for
38
weeks
without
questioning
this
business
of
having
an
arm
and
a
leg
loss,
that
they
should
have
at
least
paying
that
much,
at
least
up
to
the
time
that
he
was
classified
to
follow
the
classification.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
to
that
extent,
they
said
jenkins
was
entitled
to
$3645
but
nothing
beyond
that
point.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
sir.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
the
bottomline,
yes,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
sir.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
sir.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
no
we
relate
it
back
the
time
of
the
insurance
carrier
said
you
are
totally
disabled.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
for
the
classification.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
he
was
classified
by
the
insurance
career
in
july
1951,
and
in
december
1953
which
is
the
last
medical
evidence
in
the
record,
he
was
still
unable
to
go
back
to
work,
his
foot
is
still
not
healed.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
(inaudible)
and
perhaps
the
period
longer
depending
on
what
the
facts
are,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well
if
the
healing
was
completed
or
else
the
doctor
said
we
can't
do
anything
more,
the
board
would
stop
the
temporary
compensation
because
it's
no
longer
temporary.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
and
at
that
time
award
him
permanently
total
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
8100
dollars,
mr.
john
h.
dimond
under
the
act
in
effect
at
that
time,
the
act
has
been
changed
since
then
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
at
that
time
it
was
$8100,
that
was
the
total
he
could
receive
for
total
and
permanent
disability,
if
he
lost
all
four
limbs,
he
would
only
get
8100
dollars
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
i
think
you
are
right
your
honor
yes.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
but
that's
my
contention
your
honor.
to
a
certain
extent
the
permanent
award
may
has
some
relation
to
wages,
i
don't
know
just
how
you
can
tie
them
now.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
no,
it
isn't
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
right
your
honor,
yes.
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
he
is
earning
or
how
much
he'll
earn
after
the
injury,
he
may
go
back
to
the
same
job
and
get
an
increase
in
salary.
he
still
gets
the
maximum
award,
if
he
looses
certain
members
of
his
body.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well
if
the
case
ever
goes
back
to
the
board
that
it
will
have
to
call
in
jenkins
and
then
doctors
and
say
now
when
did
this
foot
heal,
or
when
was
it
stabilized
and
came
up
to
that
date?
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yeah
it's
possible.
i
don't
think
that's
the
fact
your
honor
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
not
being
point
of.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes,
your
honor
by
the
industrial
board,
which
is
the
fact
finding
body.
i
wanted
to
emphasize
the
provisions
of
the
temporary
compensation
provision
which
is
somewhat
unique
and
not
like
the
state
statutes
on
this
provision.
i
think
most
states
have
your
partial
permanent
and
total
permanent
awards
which
go
over
a
number
of
weeks.
here
you
get
a
lump
sum
provision
for
permanent
injury
whether
it's
partial
or
total
and
i
suppose
the
legislature
had
in
mind
that
to
--
that
in
the
average
case
a
man
who
has
--
loses
an
arm
or
a
leg
has
some
adverse
effect
on
his
future
earning
power
and
perhaps
this
was
the
only
way
they
could
compensate
him
in
some
measure
for
what
may
be
an
adverse
effect,
whether
it
is
or
not.
whereas
the
other
section
which
is
entirely
separate
says
for
all
injuries
throughout
the
temporary
disability,
not
just
those
injuries
which
are
without
a
loss
of
two
limbs.
they
should
be
paid
daily
average
wages
and
then
the
second
sentence
of
that
provision
i
think
requires
some
emphasis
and
attention.
it
says
in
all
cases
where
the
injury
develops
or
proves
to
be
set
as
to
entitle
the
workman
to
some
compensation
under
any
other
provision
of
this
schedule;
then
the
two
awards
shall
be
paid
at
the
same
time.
in
other
words
the
court
of
appeals
admitted
that
other
cases
are
cases
of
permanent
injury,
and
so
if
a
man
loses
his
arm
your
honors,
and
is
paid
temporary
compensation
during
the
healing
period,
he
can
also
receive
the
permanent
award
for
the
loss
of
an
arm.
of
course
the
court
of
appeal
stops
when
you
get
two
limbs
gone
and
say
that
after
the
second
amputation
and
in
fact
or
after
the
classification
when
they
make
up
their
mind
that
he's
permanently
and
totally
disabled,
even
though
he's
not
healed,
even
though
it
might
be
two
years
before
he
can
go
back
to
work
and
earn
wages,
he
can't
receive
any
more
temporary
compensation.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
clear
express
language
of
the
alaska
legislature
in
temporary
provision
statute.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well
that's
what
did
disturb
me
your
honor
about
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
thought
logically
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
were
going
to
hold
the
way
it
did,
would
say
that
after
the
second
amputation
he
was
--
he
should
be
then
totally
and
permanently
disabled
and
should
receive
no
further
compensation.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
the
insurance
carrier
continues
to
pay
him
temporary
disability,
mistakenly
for
another
38
weeks
that
they're
stuck
with
that
payment.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
these
payments
are
treated
by
the
employee
as
income
and
they
would
prejudice
him
in
some
way
if
he
had
to
pay
it
back,
i
wasn't
quite
sure
of
what
the
--
of
their
reasoning
there.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
your
honor,
it
constitutes
total
and
permanent
disability
so
far
as
the
amount
of
money
the
man
gets,
but
it
may
not
totally
disable
him
for
earning
the
living
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
he
can
not,
in
literal
sense
be
temporally
and
permanently
disabled
at
the
same
time
your
honor,
but
if
the
man
loses
an
arm
and
a
leg,
it's
true
the
legislature
said
he's
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
but
i
think
you
have
to
read
this
in
the
context
of
the
whole
statute
which
indicates
that
for
a
total
and
permanent
disability
the
total
amount
of
money
you
can
get
is
$8,100,
and
the
legislature
must
have
recognized
the
fact
that
people
who
lose
arms
and
legs
are
not
necessarily
completely
unable
to
earn
a
living.
now
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
after
this
man
had
lost
his
arm
and
his
leg
a
year
later,
he
could
have
gone
back
to
work,
except
the
fact
that
his
other
injury
didn't
heal,
and
so
he
had
some
remaining
earning
capacity
despite
the
conclusive
presumption
assumed
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
had
an
earning.
he
actually
did
have
some
and
that
was
temporarily
impaired
by
this
second
injury.
i
think
an
example
your
honor
of
why
this
must
be
the
case
is
let's
assume
jenkins
lost
the
hearing
in
both
the
ears
in
his
employment,
and
he
went
back
to
work
a
month
a
later
as
the
line
man
again,
now
he
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled
because
he's
lost
the
hearing
in
both
the
ears,
and
yet
if
he
received
an
electrical
burn
and
hurt
his
left
foot
under
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
he
could
receive
nothing,
even
though
the
act
says
for
all
injuries
causing
temporary
disability
he
shall
receive
so
much
money.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
they
could
have
left
it
out
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well
i
think
they
should
have
left
it
out
your
honor
and
just
talk
about
the
maximum
award
a
man
should
receive
for
certain
loss
of
memory.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
no,
it
doesn't
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
there
are
state
cases
cited
in
our
brief
where
a
man
has
received
total
and
permanent
award
and
then
later
in
other
employment
received
an
injury
and
is
compensated
for
it.
he
was
able
to
work
and
as
they
took
him
back
to
work
so
they
should
pay
for
the
injuries
that
occurred
for
him.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
the
total
amount
that
he
is
entitled
to
earn
in
court
of
appeal's
theory
is
$3,645
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
it
was
$470
i
think,
roughly.
if
he
were
entitled
to
the
temporary
disability
your
honor
until
the
time
of
healing
was
over
he
would
get
around.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
around
15,000.
yes.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
all
employees,
except
those
on
government
projects,
your
honor.
in
the
alaska
where
you
have
defense
construction
under
government
auspices
they
are
under
the
defense
base's
act,
but
otherwise
it
applies
to
all
employees
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
your
honor,
it
would.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yeah,
right
up
to
the
time
of
amputations
that
can
classify
them.
you
can
say
here
is
all
you're
going
to
get,
you
know
it
takes
years
to
your
wounds
to
heal
and
that's
why
we
think
the
decision
is
unjust.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
cases
other
than
temporary
disability
your
honor
would
be
cases
of
permanent
injuries.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well,
these
cases
are
disfigurement,
your
honor
which
maybe
classified
as
permanent
type
of
injury.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
i
didn't
include
the
disfigurement
provisions.
i
guess
i
did
provide
it
in
here
on
page
v,
roman
numeral
v,
the
appendix
of
the
brief,
industrial
board
may
award
proper
and
adequate
compensation
with
serious
head,
neck,
facial,
or
other
disfigurement.
that
would
be
another
type
of
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
if
the
man
is
receiving
temporary
disability
and
then
the
board
finds
that
he
was
permanently
injured,
he
is
entitled
to
the
certain
permanent
award,
he
gets
both
types
of
compensation.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
in
the
average
case
that
happens
your
honor,
but
then
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
effect
that
when
it's
determined
it's
permanent
he
can't
draw
anymore
temporary,
but
my
contention
here
is,
the
petitioner's
is
that
if
he
loses
an
arm
and
a
leg,
right
away
they
can
classify
him
as
permanent
the
day
of
the
injury
even
though
the
facts
show
that
he
can't
go
back
to
work
for
two
years,
because
of
the
slowness
in
healing.
so
the
court
of
appeals
modified
the
words,
so
paid
or
due
by
the
word
theretofore.
in
other
words,
up
to
the
time
of
the
classification
of
the
permanent
injury,
he
can
get
both
types
of
compensation,
but
as
soon
as
he
is
classified
as
a
total
and
permanent
disability
then
that's
the
case
is
restricted
to
that
he
is
no
longer
temporarily
disabled
and
that's
why
he
can't
draw
any
compensation.
that's
the
precise
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent.
but
my
contention
is
that
the
provision
for
temporary
disability
very
clearly
contemplates
that
a
man
should
be
compensated
for
loss
of
wages
during
the
healing
period
regardless
of
what
finding
is
made
in
that
period
as
to
the
degree
of
permanent
impairment
of
it's
earning
power
or
as
to
what
scheduled
allowance
he
is
limited
to
have.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
your
honor
i
can
find
the
exact
place
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
i
don't
have
it
marked
in
the
records,
but
i
do
in
this
printed
copy
of
the
decision.
the
court
said
cases
of
permanent
injury
are
cases
other
than
temporary
disability
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
that's
the
way
they
admitted
that
and
that's
on
page
--
here
on
page
94
of
the
records
your
honor,
the
last
sentence
cases
of
permanent
injury
are
cases
other
than
temporary
disability
within
the
meaning
of
that
section
statute
related
to
temporary
disability.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well
here
is
the
language
they
used
your
honor
in
bottom
page
94
and
the
top
of
page
95
of
the
record.
they
said
this
language
means
only
that
a
lump
sum
award
for
permanent
total
disability
shall
be
in
addition
to
any
benefits
theretofore
pay.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
they
added
the
words
theretofore
which
aren't
in
the
statute.
theretofore
pay,
that
is
paid
before
the
finding
of
a
permanent
injury.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that's
correct
your
honor,
he
could
get
nothing.
that
of
course
is
what
the
insurance
guy
would
do
under
these
decisions.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
to
both
types.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
yes.
judge
demon
gave
an
example
here
to
sent
his
opinion
of
where
a
man
might
crush
his
arm
and
leg
and
the
fight
to
save
it
for
two
years
and
finally
amputated
he
gets
all
the
temporary
compensation
for
two
years
plus
the
total
impairment
for
one.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
i
can
explain
that.
it
means
that
it's
total
and
it's
a
permanent
injury
and
it's
total
in
the
sense
that
this
is
all
you're
going
to
get
for
this
type
of
injury.
that's
the
maximum
you
can
receive.
i
don't
think
the
legislature
really
meant
in
the
light
of
the
other
provision
that
a
man
was
totally
and
permanently
disabled
from
earning
any
money
at
all
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
but
i
see
your
question
your
honor.
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
it.
literally
speaking,
that's
what
it
means
of
course
total
and
permanent
disability,
the
understanding
is
he
is
permanently
and
totally
disabled
and
yet
the
facts
are,
in
every
case
almost,
there
is
some
remaining
earning
capacity
after
a
man
loses
two
eyes
or
two
ears
or
two
hands.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
the
amount
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
that
statute
has
that
power
and
it
were
not
for
the
temporary
disability
provision
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
argue
anything,
but
they
said
in
addition
to
the
amount
for
permanent
award
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
temporary
compensation.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well,
there
is
--
mr.
john
h.
dimond
well,
that's
what
it
says,
your
honor,
but
the
two
types
are
based
on
different
concepts.
the
permanent
award
is
based
on
a
concept
not
related
to
earning
power
and
the
temporary
position
schedule
is
directly
related
to
earning
power.
and
the
language
is
susceptible
of
allowing
him
temporary
compensation
even
after
total
and
permanent
award
if
he
is
out
of
work
because
of
an
injury
until
the
injury
is
stabilized.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
he
gets
--
your
honor
he's
been
paid
a
total
of
$8100
already
and
he
gets
an
additional
$3645.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
that
seems
different
your
honor,
yeah.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
which
he's
said
before,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
your
honor,
i
can't
justify
it,
i
don't
see
if
there're
anything
loss
even
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
in
that
point
even
though
i
hate
to
talk
to
our
client
on
$3625,
i
have
to
be
frank
about
it,
i
don't
see
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
h.
dimond
i
think
the
â€“-
