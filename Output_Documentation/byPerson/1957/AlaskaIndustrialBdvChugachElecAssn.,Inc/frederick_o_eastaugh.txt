mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
the
respondents
are
here
without
having
sought
a
writ
and
they're
here
not
having
cross-petitioned.
and
the
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
we
did
not
cross-petition
before
a
writ
and
the
point
i
would
first
like
to
raise
is
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
now
i
know
that
ordinarily
under
the
rules,
the
–
nothing
can
be
raised
except
raised
by
the
writ
and
a
respondent
or
appellee
is
not
allowed
to
attack
the
judgment
in
a
lower
court,
but
the
serious
question
of
jurisdiction
commences
from
the
time
of
the
--
that
the
industrial
board
in
january
of
1954
took
cognizance
of
the
petitioner's
claim
dated
november
21,
1953,
and
that
application
for
adjustment
of
claim
was
after
the
three-year
limitation.
the
court
below
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
nothing
mr.
justice
douglas
except
the
petitioner's
original
application
and
amended
application
both
of
which
were
adjudicated,
awards
were
made,
awards
were
paid
and
no
appeal
was
taken.
but
the
court
below
in
order
to
--
get
around
this
question
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
on
the
jurisdictional
matter,
yes
they
do.
and
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
right.
they
held
two
things.
they
held
that
the
petitioner
filed
a
timely
application
and
his
original
application
and
in
his
amended
application,
both
of
which
were
prior
to
the
two-year
limitation
and
the
three
year
limitation,
the
latter
of
which
is
contained
in
section
4
of
the
act.
then
the
court
below
went
on
to
say
that
even
so
the
board
of
--
on
its
own
motion,
can
at
anytime
correct
a
previous
decision
or
reopen
a
case,
but
the
section
4
under
which
they
did
so,
carries
a
proviso
that
says
to
the
effect
that
matters
can
be
reopened
only
where
a
subsequent
change
of
condition
or
different
injury
becomes
manifest
and
application
therefore
is
made.
so
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
it
would
go
to
the
whole
judgment
justice
douglas,
because
we've
consistently
maintained
from
the
start
of
this
case,
that
is
before
the
industrial
board
hearing
on
january
8th
of
54,
and
then
in
the
district
court
and
again,
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
we
still
think
it's
a
very
serious
question.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
jurisdiction
is
always
in
order
and
i
believe
that
–-
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well
then
it
would
follow
right
through
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
believe
it
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes.
that's
our
position.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes
it
is.
i
think
i
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
that
after
three
years,
after
the
injury
under
the
act
there
being
no
application
before
it
and
the
board
not
having
on
its
own
motion
move
to
reopen
the
case,
that
it
then
lost
its
jurisdiction,
and
i
would
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
right.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
don't
believe
that
we
can
waive
the
jurisdiction
to
board.
i
think
that
it
goes
right
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
and
the
subject
matter
of
this
case,
before
this
court,
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
that
judgment
of
january
1954,
january
8.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
i
have
a
decision.
i
think
that
is
in
point
and
that
is
an
order
in
case
iwanicki
versus
state
industrial
accident
commission.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
we
often
have
to
go
outside
for
authorities
because
we
don't
have
too
many.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well
–-
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
agree.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
don't
see
how
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
that
is
kind
of
under
the
wording
of
that
statute
and
i
feel
obliged
to
call
it
to
this
court's
attention.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yeah.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
the
practical
effect
if
i'm
wrong
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
if
i'm
right,
it
would
go
right
back
to
the
jenkins,
that
is
the
petitioner,
would
lose
the
$3,645.
that
would
be
the
most
immediate
effect.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
nothing
unless
he
were
to
gain
additional
compensation,
for
example
by,
if
this
were
to
go
back
to
the
board
and
if
the
board
were
to
find
that
he
were
still,
that
his
left
foot
was
still
slipping,
he
would
lose
compensation
from
july
of
51
at
$84
a
week
to
the
present
date
in
addition
to
the
permanent
payment
that
he
has
already
received
for
permanent
total
and
the
15,000
medical
that
has
been
paid.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
just
felt
that
it
was
my
obligation
to
bring
out
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes.
that
would
be
its
effect,
justice
brennan.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes,
i
think
i
should
pass
on
to
that
now.
i'd
like
to
start
out
with
just
a
very
brief
review
of
the
alaska
act.
a
comment
has
been
made
that
the
scheduled
payments
are
not
in
lieu
of,
are
not
based
or
related
to
earning
capacity
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction.
it
is
true
that
the
lump
sum
payments
are
not
computed
by
the
earning
capacity
of
the
worker,
but
they
are
related
to
it.
now
generally
under
a
state
compensation
statute,
the
worker
for
a
permanent
partial
disability,
the
worker
would
get
two-thirds
of
his
earnings
for
a
stated
period
of
time
usually
expressed
in
weeks.
it's
true
that
that
system
relates
it
to
earnings.
the
higher
paid
worker
gets
a
little
bit
more
than
the
others,
but
the
legislature
in
effect,
regardless
of
the
ratio
use
has
determined
that
the
compensation
will
be
paid
for
certain
of
time.
now
in
alaska,
we
have
lump
sum
payments
and
possibly
that
might
relate
back
to
when
we
had
more
itinerant
workers
going
back
and
forth.
i
don't
think
it's
material.
i
think
the
thing
is
that
the
legislature
has
taken
from
the
board
the
prospect
of
computing
benefits
for
permanent
partial
and
permanent
total,
and
said
this
is
what
they
shall
get
and
those
payments
are
in
lieu
of
the
earnings
that
they
would
have
otherwise
received
during
the
period
of
their
disability.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
think
that
the
citation
in
volume
two
of
larson's
workmen's
compensation
where
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
he
was
not
dealing
but
he
discusses
all
compensation
acts
generally.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
they
are
different
to
that
respect
but
i
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
but
i
don't
see
how
any
other
interpretation
could
be.
we
don't
subscribe
to
petitioner's
interpretation
of
that
difference.
now
on
the
temporary
disability,
alaska
act
has
quite
a
unique
provision
or
did
at
this
time,
65%
of
the
workers'
wages
without
limitations
in
time
or
in
amount.
most
of
the
states
as
you,
the
court
will
know,
have
a
weekly
limitation.
for
example,
a
very
highly
paid
worker
might
by
reason
of
the
computation
of
65%
of
the
earnings
be
entitled
otherwise
to
maybe
a
$102
a
week.
in
alaska
he
would
have
gotten
that.
in
for
example,
in
most
of
the
western
states
they
generally
have
about
$30
or
$35
a
week
maximum
which
can
be
obtained
and
of
course
under
the
modification
of
the
longshore
act,
we
have
$54
in
addition.
counsel
has
always
spoken
of
the
modification
of
the
alaska
act
of
1953
and
later
in
55.
when
they
doubled
the
schedule
payments
in
53,
they
put
a
$75
a
week
limitation
on
temporary
which
is
still
twice
as
much
as
any
of
the
western
states
had
at
that
time.
in
55,
we
now
have
a
$100
a
week
limitation.
so
i
think
that
those
explanations
of
the
alaska
act
might
be
of
assistance
in
looking
into
this
problem.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
sir
they
don't.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
that's
exactly
correct?
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
can't
answer
that
question,
i
don't
know
justice
black,
but
this
particular
section
you've
been
interested
in,
has
been
in
review
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
which
were
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief,
stated
that
the
temporarily
disability
payments,
when
the
result
that
is
the
end
medical
result,
whatever
we
want
to
call
it
is
fixed,
maybe
followed
by
permanent
partial
or
permanent
total
payments
and
that
is
the
ruling
to
date
on
that
language.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
know
of
none,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
there
are
two
methods
under
--
permitted
under
the
act,
one
is
to
provide
proof
of
insurance,
the
other
is
to
provide
proof
of
financial
ability
to
entitle
an
employer
to
receive
self
insurance,
in
other
words
it
takes
a
big
company
with
considerable
monitory
assets
to
followed
by
as
a
self
insurer.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
the
alaska
industrial
board
is
defending
its
decision
and
award
of
january
8th
1954.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
it's
different
in
many
respects
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
found
it.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
–-
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
because
the
scheduled
awards
for
permanent
partial
or
permanent
total
under
the
alaska
act
are
in
lieu
of
earning
capacity.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
–-
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
i
believe
that
the
whole
basic
concept
of
workmen's
compensation
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
(inaudible)
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes!
i
think
that
--
my
answer
is
still
the
same
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
believe
that
when
the
act
was
first
passed
in
alaska
and
i
believe
the
year
was
1917
as
an
employers'
liability
act,
the
legislature
found
it
incumbent
to
make
lump
sum
settlements
for
permanent,
partial
and
permanent
total
rather
--
and
indeed
as
many
states
did
in
those
days,
many
of
the
states
then
went
over
to
the
weekly
payments.
it
was
apparently
found
out
that
the
legislature
that
didn't
fit
the
alaska
(inaudible)
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
i
think
i
will
have
to
answer
your
question
in
two
parts.
i
think
this
is
not
a
hospital
act,
a
disability
act,
it
is
a
workmen's
compensation
act,
and
i
believe
that
all
payments
under
the
act
are
in
lieu
of
workmen's
(inaudible)
and
then
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
well,
that
again
brings
in
one
of
the
basic
concepts
of
workmen's
comp
that
the
common
law
tort
is
replaced
by
this
absolute
right
to
gain
certain
specified
and
specific
payments
for
injuries
arising
out
of
employment.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
no
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
is
two
ways
of
looking
at
these
lump
sum
payments.
petitioner
is
looking
at
it
the
other
way.
now,
for
example,
you
take
two
injured
workmen,
one
earns
100
a
week,
and
one
earns
50
a
week.
if
they
both
receive
the
identical,
permanent
partial
injury,
the
poorly
paid
worker
will
receive
the
identical
amount
as
the
well
paid
worker.
now,
he
thinks
that's
good.
this
other
fellow
doesn't
think
it's
so
good.
now,
that
is
the
only
difference
between
the
alaska
act
and
the
general
act
in
the
states.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
equate
it
to
earnings
mr.
chief
justice.
for
example,
supposing
we
take
the
case
of
a
permanent
total
disability,
every
state
in
the
union
has
a
--
with
the
exception
of
several
that
go
on
for
life,
i'll
take
that
back,
but,
many
of
them,
most
of
them
in
fact
have
maximums.
now,
those
maximums
would
have
absolutely
no
relation
to
the
earning
power
of
a
high
paid
executive.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
believe
it
is
a
function
of
wages,
but
i
believe
that
the
legislature
has
the
right
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
say
in
which
way
this
will
be
computed
and
how
much
they
shall
be.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
a
comment
has
already
been
made
on
the
effect
if
this
should
go
back
to
the
board,
and
i
would
like
to
point
attention
to
page
49
of
the
record,
which
is
the
petitioner's
application
for
adjustment
of
claim,
which
incidentally
is
dated
3
years
after
the
period
of
limitation.
and
about
8
lines
up
from
the
bottom
of
page
49,
here
is
meat
of
the
request,
the
leave
entitlement
to
temporary
disability
until
there
is
an
end
to
disability.
now,
this
request
again
made
three
years
after
the
period
of
limitation
was
made
after
he
have
been
awarded
and
paid
permanent
total
disability
under
the
act,
which
we
maintain
and
we
believe
that
the
opinions
support
us
is
the
maximum
payment
under
workmen's
compensation
and
as
the
circuit
court
said,
presumes
a
complete
loss
of
earning
capacity.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
i
don't
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it's
all
through
the
act.
we
have
the
case
of
a
death
case.
we
have
a
case
of
a
man
that
is
permanently
totally
disabled
that
would
never
be
able
to
work
under
any
conditions,
and
the
legislature
fixed
that
amount.
here
we
have
a
man
that
presumably
will
some
day
be
able
to
work
--
enter
the
labor
market
again.
now
if
he
does
so,
after
he
gets
the
maximum
benefit
and
he
is
again
hurt
he
can
start
in
on
total
disability
--
temporary
disability
payments,
when
his
condition
becomes
fixed,
they
can
ripen
again
into
total,
permanent
total
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes,
we
do
justice
whittaker.
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
yes,
whenever
there
is
a
permanent
injury
of
any
nature,
the
person
against,
that
is
the
carrier
pays
in
addition
to
the
injured
workman
a
2%
of
the
award,
and
that
goes
in
to
the
second
injury
fund
and
is
used
for
those
cases
where
before
this
accident,
there
is
a
pre-existing
condition
and
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
right.
well,
i
would
also
like
to
in
connection
of
that
application
refer
to
page
52
of
the
record
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
52
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
--
which
shows
the
decision
of
the
alaska
industrial
board
dated
january
8,
1954.
now,
that
decision
shows
that
in
1954,
the
petitioner
was
then
totally
disabled
on
a
temporary
basis
that
the
condition
continued
to
this
date.
so,
we
don't
have
--
mr.
frederick
o.
eastaugh
right.
so,
it
is
quite
possible
that
if
this
goes
back
to
the
industrial
board
and
jenkins'
left
foot
never
heals,
that
he
could
be
having,
could
well
have
been
paid
permanent
total
disability,
the
maximum
under
the
act,
and
temporary
total
for
8
years
or
7
years
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
has
reached
his
--
