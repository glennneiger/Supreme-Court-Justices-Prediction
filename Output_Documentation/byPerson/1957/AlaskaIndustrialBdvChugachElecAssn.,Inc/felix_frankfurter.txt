justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
a
question
to
ask
you.
assume
you're
right
about
the
so
called
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
let
me
(inaudible)
about
the
board,
is
that
going
without
jurisdiction,
or
that
board
is
without
jurisdiction,
so
it
automatically
followed
or
it
did,
it's
not
employed
and
it's
not
been
there
and
therefore
it's
nothing
new
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
have
(inaudible)
contend
that
in
order
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
this
(inaudible)
the
thought
is
limited,
so
that
it
would
not
curable
by,
anyway
it
does,
the
regularity
court
of
appeals
does
reflected
(inaudible),
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
you
think
in
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
in
your
view
is
the
patent
effect
which
makes
the
whole
proceeding
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
advert
to
chief
justice's
question,
(inaudible)
that
alaska
statue
is
rather
unique
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
i
want
to
put
you
is
would
you
be
good
enough
to
be
more
specific
in
answering
(inaudible)
my
difficulty
as
you
see
is
how
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
(inaudible)
--
would
you
say
that
is
the
fair
characterization
of
the
issue
of
the
(inaudible)
court's
opinion
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
us
(inaudible)
why
isn't
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
determination
to
be
made,
isn't
it?
(inaudible)
isn't
that
almost
the
entire
problem
before
us
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
now
the
question
is
whether
this
specialized
legislation
(inaudible)
compensation
act
in
many
ways
and
the
question
is
whether
that
general
concept
infuses
this
specialized
formulation
of
the
workmen
compensation
(inaudible)
isn't
that
really
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
i
think
it's
relevant
to
ask
you
this
what
is
there
either
or
(inaudible)
of
the
statue
all
provisions
that
(inaudible)
include
all
act
legislative
history
that
(inaudible)
that
the
manner
in
which
the
(inaudible)
provision
was
drawn
would
cause
(inaudible)
having
due
regard
to
the
way
workmen
compensation
act
is
to
be
construed
that
the
alaska
act
did
not
mean
(inaudible)
and
clean
it
all
after
one
payment
when
there
is
(inaudible).
i
think
that's
the
question
(inaudible)
that
either
by
express
terms
that
they
are
not
leased
but
by
fair,
reasonable
and
appropriately
considered
construction
of
the
entire
statute
including
it's
different
from
other
statutes
(inaudible)
one
should
must
come
or
reasonably
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
alaska
meant
to
have
just
one
final
settlement
in
case
of
a
permanent
disability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
the
fact
that
it's
compounded
into
so
many
dollars
and
cents,
the
regular
(inaudible)
so
many
dollars
and
so
many
whatever
it
is
(inaudible)
so
many
dollars
have
been
added
to
those,
here
is
a
fixed
amount
--
withdraw
the
whole
matter
from
any
further
litigation,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
mode
of
repayment
of
a
physical
injury
is
a
function
of
wage
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
