alaska
industrial

carl
e.
jenkins,
petitioners,
versus
chugach
electric
association,
inc.
mr.
dimond,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
you're
saying
mr.
dimond,
it
was
the
practice
under
your
act
to
pay
the
petitioner
compensation
until
he
was
healed,
and
then
after
he
was
healed
to
make
the
permanent
award.
chief
justice
earl
warren
courts
have
sustained
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
indication
here
why
they
didn't
follow
that
practice
and
wait
to
lose
till
that
left
foot
has
healed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
they
quit
â€“-
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
if
a
man
at
the
time
of
the
accident
had
his
arms
and
legs
severed
and
the
insurance
carrier
came
right
in
and
said
we
acknowledge
that
he
is
permanently
disabled
that
he
would
get
nothing
for
his
disable
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
that
carried
to
of
an
injury
which
he
might
have
recovered
and
it
went
along
for
a
year
or
maybe
two
years
as
a
temporary
disability
and
then
it
developed
into
a
permanent
disability
he
would
be
entitled
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
eastaugh?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
language
do
you
rely
upon
for
the
last
interpretation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
dealing
with
alaska?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
different
as
you
just
stated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said,
it
wasn't
a
material
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
this
(inaudible)
or
temporary
disability,
do
they
make
any
distinctions
(inaudible)
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
just
the
same
for
the
general
manager
of
the
company
as
well
as
with
one
of
the
labors.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
you
equate
it
to
the
payment,
to
earnings,
if
it
applies
to
manager
of
corporation
who
is
making
$50,000
a
year
and
also
the
same
degree
a
worker
who
gets
say
$5000
a
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
it
says
and
continues
--
no
end
medical
result
having
been
reached.
