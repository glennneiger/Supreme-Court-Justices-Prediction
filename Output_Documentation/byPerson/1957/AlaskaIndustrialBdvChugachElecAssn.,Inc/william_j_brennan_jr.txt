justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
wondering,
is
that
--
is
that
an
issue
we
have
to
determine
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
basically
is
this
a
question
of
the
construction
of
the
alaska
act
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
his
one
foot
had
not
--
was
still
under
treatment,
was
it
not,
that
hadn't
reached
the
point
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
even
though
perhaps
with
the
artificial
limbs
he
might
have
been
able
to
do
some
limited
kind
of
work,
he
was
disabled
by
reason
of
the
foot
conditions
from
even
doing
that,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
he
should
be
under
your
view
entitled
a
temporary
compensation
until
a
period
of
finality
or
judgment
of
finality
as
to
the
leg
injury
had
been
reached?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dimond,
i
connect
this
as
in
dollars
and
cents.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
from
the
date
of
the
accident
until
some
particular
date
that
was
the
time
of
the
second
amputation,
there's
no
question
that
he
was
entitled
to
temporary
allowance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
just
one
month?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
it
was
that
they
continued
paying
him
after
the
second
amputation
for
38
weeks.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
they
classified
him
as
permanent
total,
they
tried
to
relate
it
back
to
the
date
of
his
second
amputation
and
court
of
appeals
said,
no,
they
couldn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
did
for
the
purposes
of
construction
of
the
statute
relate
back
to
the
time
of
the
second
amputation,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
well
as
the
sum
in
total.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
time
out
to
the
classification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
you
are
right,
how
long
after
that
date
of
classification
would
he
still
be
entitled
to
temporary
disability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
had
it
for
that
period
up
to
december
'53
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
when
finally
either
those
healing
or
the
doctor
said
nothing
more
could
be
done,
what
would
be
the
basis
slab
of
the
permanent
award
on
your
approach?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
the
permanent
until
then
be
8100
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
still
8100.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
you're
right
after
1953
that
he
is
entitled
temporary
up
to
that
date,
will
there
be
another
proceeding
to
determine
whether
he
is
entitled
to
temporary
beyond
that
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
still
be
unstabilized
type.
well
this
is
five
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
have
to
be
a
new
determination
of
the
terminal
date
in
any
event
of
the
temporary
disability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
it
is
the
jargon
of
workmen's
compensation
act,
isn't
it
mr.
dimond?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understand
it
ordinarily
as
you've
just
said.
it
doesn't
mean
that
one
is
utterly
unable
to
do
anything
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
gainful
employment,
he
may
still
be
able
to
do
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
decisions
of
your
courts
would
say
that
that's
failed
to
the
jurisdiction
to
take
an
action
at
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
an
oregon
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
are
dealing
with
alaska
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
whether
may
we
independently
arrive
at
an
interpretation
of
your
alaskan
statute
if
the
courts
haven't
said
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
actually
in
this
instance,
at
least
we
have
a
interpretation
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
that
you
are
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
rather
settle
definitely
that
question
so
far
as
alaskan
statute
is
concerned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
practical
effect
if
you're
right
on
this
judgment,
it
gets
nothing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
are
right,
if
you
are
right,
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
else
would
you
lose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
actually
then
asking
is
to
reinstate
the
district
court
judgment,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'm
not,
i'm
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
wondered
why
the
attorney
general
was
on
the
speech
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
