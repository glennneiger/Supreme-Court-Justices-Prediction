suppose
it
does
and
the
fact
still
remains
into
the
court
of
justice,
a
judgment
is
rendered
against
him
by
failure
to
produce
something
that
they
can't
produce.

how
can
you
penalize
one
when
neither
one
of
them
could
produce
it
and
make
one
of
them
lose
this
lawsuit
on
that
basis?
i'm
not
saying
(inaudible).
how
can
you
put
him
in
and
not
condemn
to
whatever
it
is?
say
you
just
can't
see
the
name
so
you
won't
produce
these
papers.
he
says,
“i
can't.”
you
say,
“i
know
that.
we
can't
either.”
but
you've
got
to
stop
the
lawsuit.
