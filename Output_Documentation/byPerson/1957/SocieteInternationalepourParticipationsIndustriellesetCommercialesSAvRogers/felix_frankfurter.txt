justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
from
that
that
there
was
a
forethought
on
this,
there
was
a
design
that
--
there's
an
imaginative
projection
into
the
future
that
the
time
would
come
when
they
could
get
the
comfortable
protection
of
the
swiss
secrecy
laws
through
the
operation
of
the
swiss
secrecy
laws
upon
the
bank?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
by
going
to
the
facts.
when
did
the
relationship
between
the
petitioner
and
the
bank
in
order
in
the
future
when
the
time
comes
for
this
kind
of
litigation
utilize
the
protection
of
the
secrecy
law
and
invoke
against
the
bank,
when
did
that
begin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
suggestion
that
1928
on,
there
was
the
forethought
on
this
that
it
would
be
profitable
one
of
these
days
to
have
a
connection
with
a
bank
as
to
which
the
swiss
government
may
invoke
the
clause
of
secrecy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
1928?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
almost
carries
the
suggestion
that
the
swiss
government
was
uncooperative
with
this
government
in
favor
of
somebody
who
tried
to
evade
its
own
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
--
are
you
saying
that
the
purposes
of
their
own,
for
their
own
selfish
business,
call
it
what
you
will,
the
purposes
of
their
own,
these
petitioners
disabled
themselves
from
carrying
out
such
an
order
as
the
order
to
produce
in
this
case.
that's
in
effect
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know,
are
there
any
findings
to
that
effect?
were
there
any
--
any
cases
in
the
record
on
which
the
court
--
this
court
can
proceed
with
that
as
a
starting
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
places,
these
petitioners
use
this
bank
for
cloaking
transactions
of
their
own
unrelated
to
this
present
thing,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
there
is
that
interlocking
interest
of
which
you
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
through
a
bank
designed
by
these
petitioners
for
purposes
of
their
own
whether
i'm
looking
at
it
for
this
litigation
or
not,
all
in
that,
designed
by
these
petitioners
for
purposes
of
their
own
which
to
the
knowledge
of
these
petitioners
may
subject
the
bank
to
a
veto
on
the
part
of
the
swiss
government
for
the
production
of
the
document,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
find
it
difficult
if
all
that
is
so,
why
we
should
have
a
finding
of
good
faith
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
have
a
very
specialized
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
this
time,
these
petitioners
at
this
time
are
not
using
their
own
powers
to
tell
the
bank
not
to
produce
or
to
tell
the
swiss
government
not
to
relay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
he's
always
simplifying.
i
want
to
see
how
--
what
the
reach
of
your
argument
is.
suppose
concededly
without
any
participation,
not
any
--
the
remotest
responsibility
so
far
as
responsibility
there
have
been
in
his
work,
these
documents
had
been
destroyed.
these
documents,
physical
documents
in
the
possession
of
the
swiss
bank
had
been
destroyed,
had
been
physically
made
non-existence
by
somebody
for
reasons
of
its
own,
some
official
of
the
bank
wanted
to
cover
up
their
falsification
and
whatnot.
but
it's
all
in
there
that
he
would
have
to
concede
the
present
petitioner
had
no
relation
or
whatever
not
to
the
remote
to
the
unavailability,
the
physical
unavailability
of
the
documents.
but
it
is
a
fact
that
they
did
utilize
in
the
way
which
was
indicated
this
fact
as
a
means
of
doing
this
interlocking
cover
up
business.
would
you
say
there
that
what
before
their
fact
of
having
done
business
with
the
bank
is
not
--
that
it
wouldn't
be
there
and
therefore
they
wouldn't
have
been
destroyed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
different
case
and
that's
what
you're
saying
in
this
case
that
this
was
a
corporate
and
part
of
an
intercoporate
relation
in
trying
(inaudible),
american
holding
company.
and
to
utilize
this
reticulated
scheme
for
carrying
on
business
and
therefore
knowingly
subjected
themselves
to
the
kind
of
legal
power
that
the
swiss
government
has
acted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
an
alternative
either
or
is
that
--
he
must
make
a
choice
here
just
as
you've
just
indicated
that
even
this
case
must
be
dismissed
or
we
can
go
on
without
these
records
in
this
litigation.
a
--
are
those
the
only
--
is
that
the
only
choice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
a
question,
mr.
justice
black?
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
function
of
these
findings
as
a
matter
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
their
relation
to
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
your
position.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
broader
issue
on
which
justice
black
inquired,
whether
this
broader
issue
that
they
disable
themselves
and
therefore
it
couldn't
produce
not
because
it
was
beyond
their
physical
or
legal
capacities
but
because
--
by
their
own
willfulness.
was
that
not
an
issue
before
the
master's?
why
--
why
wasn't
that
an
issue
in
the
proceeding
in
which
he
wrote
these
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
want
to
know
why
it
wasn't.it
seems
to
me
if
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
couldn't
produce
by
their
own
conduct,
by
virtue
of
their
own
disabling
conduct.
that
simply
bears
on
the
question
of
--
of
good
faith
in
a
larger
aspect
to
be
sure
that
good
faith
in
1952
but
good
faith
in
producing
a
situation
so
that
there's
nothing
to
produce
in
1952.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
seemed
to
me
if
you're
right
about
that
a
fortiori
should
have
been
--
it
was
an
issue.
you
see
it's
so
obvious
that
--
that
it
is
a
complete
answer
but
it
wasn't
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
solicitor,
the
risk
of
redundancy
and
i
can
bring
together
the
questions
of
justice
black
and
justice
harlan
and
my
own
because
i
think
this
is
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
part
of
the
whole
problem.
are
you
--
you've
made
--
in
taking
two
legal
positions,
i
do
not
say
contradictory,
they're
--
they're
complementary.
you
say
and
i
can
understand
that
argument
well.
this
is
a
dispute
between
swiss
nationals
and
the
american
government,
interest
of
the
united
states
that
are
being
pursued
in
a
litigation
in
the
united
states
necessary
for
the
fair
determination
of
that
litigation
of
some
documents
located
in
switzerland.
as
to
those
documents,
the
swiss
government
consulting
its
own
national
policy
and
says,
"we
won't
allow
you
to
produce
it,"
and
you
say
that's
too
bad.
you
have
to
choose
between
the
interest
of
the
united
states
and
(inaudible).
and
the
swiss
national
will
also
be
entitled
to
due
process
in
the
united
states
that
these
documents
are
essential
and
this
government
for
his
own
interest
refuses
to
give
him
that
support
to
vindicate
his
interest
and
this
government,
the
judiciary
of
the
united
states
has
a
right
to
say
in
the
interest
of
fair
administration
of
justice
gives
(inaudible).
thats'
--
that's
one
of
your
positions,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
wouldn't
be
so,
you'd
say,
in
the
case
these
documents
were
in
england,
the
bank
of
england,
as
being
put
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
say
that
would
be
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
a
totally
different
--
a
totally
different
line
of
approach
you
made
to
wit
--
to
be
sure
the
swiss
government
if
they
know
this
bank
for
its
own
means.
they
can't
produce
these
documents
and
to
be
sure
the
swiss
government
to
be
respected
in
pursuing
(inaudible)
our
--
our
state
department
(inaudible)
going
to
persuade
it
and
then
needs
time
to
pass.
what
you
say
that
is
all
irrelevant.
it
is
immaterial.
you,
the
petitioner
make
yourselves
in
the
position
for
your
own
interest
whereby
you
made
in
--
whereby
you'd
be
invoked,
whereby
you
brought
into
action
this
national
policy
of
system.
and
therefore
in
effect,
you
disabled
yourself
from
heeding
the
judicial
demand
of
the
united
states
court.
that's
your
other
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
say
if
that
is
so,
if
that's
the
line
and
if
you
say
the
record
is
replete
with
proof
of
that
line
of
argument
then
i
don't
for
the
life
of
(inaudible)
why
all
these
perfectly
futile,
useless
reference
to
the
master
and
his
conclusions
on
page
545
(1),
the
verdict
upon
plaintiff
to
show
good
faith
in
the
effort
to
keep
efforts
to
comply
to
this
court's
order
(inaudible)
to
produce
the
papers
of
sturzenegger
or
--
and
company
for
inspection
by
the
government.
two,
because
you're
the
plaintiff,
efforts
were
made
in
good
faith
as
where
the
plaintiff
made
the
effort
which
a
reasonable
man
was
made
to
decide
and
to
choose
effective
compliance
that
this
court
ordered.
three,
in
the
opinion
of
the
master,
the
plaintiff
had
to
stay
in
the
burden
of
proof
based
upon
it
and
had
shown
good
faith
in
its
effort.
i
say
that
with
reference
to
those
findings
of
the
master,
in
that
whole
proceeding,
one
could
demur
in
the
old
fashion
way
and
say
whatever?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument.
you
say
whatever,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
now
attacking
the
finding
and
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
what
--
why
do
we
not
find
the
--
the
statement
you've
just
made
adjudicated
by
the
two
lower
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
didn't
they
--
why
(inaudible)
so
far
as
i
know.
why
do
we
not
find
even
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
--
the
lines
of
exposition
that
you
just
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
didn't
go
that
far
on
the
other
ground
that
raises
a
question
about
which
the
court
is
inquiring.
i
don't
see
why
you
call
it
going
that
far
because
what
you
just
said
is
that
they've
been
so
skillful
in
their
manipulation
in
the
heart
of
the
matter
of
it
that
--
that
they
disabled
themselves
(inaudible).
that's
really
the
heart
of
it,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
of
course
they
couldn't
produce
the
bank
because
they
saw
do
it
that
the
banks
were
subject
to
the
control
of
the
swiss
government
which
might
well
prevent
them
from
giving
up
those
documents
and
they
were
shrewd
enough
beginning
with
1928
to
create
that
situation.
that
is
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
reject
that.
i
didn't
mean
in
my
own
mind
or
in
what
i
said
to
reject
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
--
that's
--
that's
a
nice
and
clear
legal
question
whether
in
a
litigation
in
this
country
documents
become
relevant.
they
were
incapable
of
being
produced
because
the
government
of
the
national
refuses
whether
that's
too
bad
but
the
american
interest
prevails.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
that's
a
very
different
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
thinking
of
the
possibility
that
that
argument
might
be
rejected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
--
and
if
that
is
rejected
i
mean
that's
--
i
don't
know
what
--
what
i
think
about
it.
but
if
that
is
rejected
the
question
is
whether
the
other
(inaudible)
which
you
--
to
which
you've
directed
our
attention
in
the
road
of
--
of
really
lack
of
good
faith
intrinsically,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
really
you're
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
assumption
that
you
just
made
a
minute
ago
that
he
is
innocent.
you
say
--
you
say
because
on
the
assumption
even
that
--
that
he's
innocent,
that
we're
dealing
with
an
innocent
plaintiff,
the
law
of
the
forum,
the
law
of
the
united
states
is
discovery.
his
country
forbids
him,
too
bad,
and
so
we
decide
against
if
he's
innocent
one
part
is
a
little
bit
wrong,
but
if
--
on
the
other
facts,
one
part
isn't
wrong,
something
else
is
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
trouble
you
to
leave
with
the
clerk
a
reference
to
or
if
it's
in
the
record.
i
want
to
find
it.
i'd
like
to
see
the
terms
of
reference
to
the
master,
the
master.
if
it
wasn't
printed
in
the
record,
if
not
would
you
--
if
it's
not
printed,
would
you
mind
filing
with
the
clerk
a
copy
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
do
with
a
case
like
kronprinzessin
victoria?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
for
those
--
there
were
very
important
observations
by
lord
sumner
about
the
--
the
difficulties
of
swiss
--
swedish
law
not
allowing
the
production
of
those
documents
which
might
have
sustained
the
case
of
the
claimant
against
the
captain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
that
difference.
but
i
was
referring
to
the
--
to
the
general
observation
as
to
the
claims
that
can
be
made
by
a
national
that
my
country
prevents
me
from
putting
in
a
case
which
if
i
could
put
in
would
enable
me
to
win.
