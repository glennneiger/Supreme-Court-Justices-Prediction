justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
that
show
in
the
record
presented
for
that
dispute
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
lack
of
control,
the
lack
of
ability
to
produce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that's
true,
what
is
the
basis
on
this
court?
when
did
the
judgment
against
him
for
failing
to
produce?
it
would
seem
we
might
have
raised
some
other
issues.
it
seems
here
as
i
understand
the
accusation
the
judgment
is
rendered
only
for
the
failure
to
produce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
excuse
as
i
understand
you
is
at
this
time,
this
time
they
didn't
do
it
here,
if
we
don't
have
them,
we
can't
get
--
we
can't
get
them
here
and
you
say
that
the
court
rendered
a
judgment
to
dismiss
the
case
for
failure
to
produce
something
they
could
not
produce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that.
the
issue
on
which
the
judgment
rests
is
that
they
failed
to
produce
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
that
you
say
that
you
accept
the
finding,
the
only
reason
they
failed
to
produce
it
at
this
time
is
because
they
couldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
had
good
faith,
they
could
do
it,
they're
trying
to
construe
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
how
you
might
have
a
right
to
decide
against
the
litigant
on
--
of
he
had
defrauded
the
government
in
advance
of
an
order
to
produce.but
how
can
you
get
a
judgment
against
him
for
failure
to
produce
when
you
have
to
admit
that
you
couldn't
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
--
suppose
this
evidence
in
the
record,
(inaudible).
as
i
understand
what
you're
saying
is
that
they're
justified
in
dismissing
this
case
not
because
they
failed
to
produce
when
they
could
have
produced
but
because
they
failed
to
produce
--
when
they
couldn't
produce
as
a
result
of
their
own
previous
activities.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
you've
had
that
and
dismissed
this
case
by
finding
that
you
didn't
produce
it
but
had
made
no
findings
and
you
dumped
into
the
river.
would
we
have
to
look
at
the
records
and
see
if
he
did
dump
it
into
the
river
or
should
we
wait
for
the
findings
and
wait
for
the
case
to
be
tried
so
that
we
could
--
we
could
get
to
the
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
findings
that
they
disabled
themselves
by
their
previous
activities
from
producing
this
at
that
time
when
they
were
unable
to
produce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
issue
of
tax
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
that
--
that
your
answer
to
it
that
means
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
if
--
if
i
assume
that
if
a
person
goes
out
to
hide
(inaudible)
conceals
his
income
into
court
and
say,
"i
can't
produce‚Äù
if
they
ask
him
to
produce
and
said
that
he
can't
produce
them.it
could
be
shown
that
he
was
not
acting
in
good
faith
because
he
concealed
those
papers
himself.
but
if
you
then
find
from
evidence
that
he's
acting
in
good
faith,
why
doesn't
that
refute
your
argument
that
you
are
making
here
that
he
was
himself
responsible
for
the
situation
which
made
it
impossible
to
produce
at
the
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
not,
shouldn't
there
be
before
we
are
called
on
to
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
a
practical
matter
on
the
subject
of
what
you
are
arguing
with
this.
the
government
believes
this
is
enemy
tainted.
they
can't
prove
it
without
these
papers
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
speak
though
or
should
be
allowed
to
get
a
judgment
against
it
because
they
have
(inaudible)
of
the
government
in
placing
the
papers
beyond
the
control
of
the
government.
and
if
that
can
prove
it,
that
is
kind
of
a
separate
and
distinct
cause
of
action
from
your
(inaudible)
one
that
should
be
litigated
before
you
should
have
a
judgment
rather
than
have
it
dismissed
on
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
can't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
burden
is
on
them
to
prove
their
case
and
they
don't
prove
it
well,
the
government
will
be
heard
but
they
don't
produce
the
papers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
point
here
where
you've
had
their
papers
and
they
say
we
can't
produce
it.
you
have
no
way
to
get
it.
you
say
that
there's
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
somebody
could
find
if
they
look
at
it
that
it
is
because
of
a
fraud
they're
perpetrating
on
the
government
and
that
they
have
placed
this
all
into
a
special
situation
to
disable
the
government
from
proving
its
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
got
--
that
would
be
the
proposition
(inaudible).
is
it
the
law
of
america
contrary
to
that
(inaudible)
that
a
person
who
can't
produce
papers
shall
be
thrown
out
of
court
because
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
not
your
defense.
