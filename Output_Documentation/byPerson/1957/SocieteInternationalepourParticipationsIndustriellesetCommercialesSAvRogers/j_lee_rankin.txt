mr.
j.
lee
rankin
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
going
further,
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
interveners
involved
in
the
kaufman
case
are
expressly
not
covered
by
this
order
that
is
judge
laws
expressly
provided
that
this
order
of
dismissal
would
not
affect
the
interveners
who
are
not
in
custody
or
control
of
these
records.
secondly,
i
think
that
we
need
some
more
facts
in
order
to
be
able
to
examine
the
problems
in
this
case.
we
start
off
with
the
proposition
first
that
there
is
no
question,
there
is
no
debate
about
the
proposition
that
these
concerns
were
with
--
were
controlled
by
germans,
by
i.g.
farben
up
to
1940.
there
is
no
issue
between
us
on
that.
it's
clear
the
record
is
without
dispute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
control
in
the
--
is
in
--
is
combined
as
to
the
swiss
bank
and
chemie,
the
petitioner,
and
sturzenegger.
and
sturzenegger
appears
over
with
his
predecessor,
greutert,
who
also
was
the
manager
of
the
bank
before
he
died.
as
one
of
the
directors
of
the
petitioner,
chemie,
and
then
there
was
gadow,
who
was
the
director
of
the
petitioner,
chemie.
and
gadow
was
the
brother-in-law
of
hermann
schmitz,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
i.g.
farben.
and
the
set
up
was
that
gadow
or
sturzenegger
and
one
other
signature,
either
gadow
and
sturzenegger
together
or
greutert,
his
predecessor
or
sturzenegger
and
one
of
his
clerks
could
always
bind
the
petitioner
as
to
any
action
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
now
until
1936,
this
bank
which
was
just
a
small
private
bank
only
had
50
to
100
customers.
and
all
of
these
customers,
mind
you,
all
of
them
were
i.g.
farben
connected.
they
were
either
i.g.
farben
or
they
were
connected
with
i.g.
farben.
so
i
want
you
to
see
the
picture
here
of
the
interlocking
of
this
private
bank
that's
used
in
all
of
these
transactions.
and
the
petitioner
and
why
these
courts
in
examining
this
matter
over
a
period
of
almost
10
years
now
saw
fit
to
say
that
you
can't
come
into
court
in
this
country
and
try
out
this
case
without
producing
all
of
the
records
that
will
show
the
enemy
taint
that
appears
in
this
picture.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
got
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
got
findings
that
they
were
not
in
bad
faith
in
collaborating
or
acting
with
the
swiss
to
hold
the
papers
back.
what
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
and
have
you
understand
is
that
the
whole
plan
of
this
program,
this
conspiracy
of
cloaking
that's
involved
in
this
case
was
to
first
use
this
private
bank
and
have
the
benefit
of
these
secrecy
laws
and
not
have
to
develop
or
present
the
records
because
of
these
laws.
and
they've
used
them
for
various
purposes
throughout
the
history
of
this
transaction.
now,
without
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
inference.
now,
without
any
saying
any
claim
at
all
--
and
that
--
that
is
decided
against
us
that
they
persuaded
the
swiss
to
hold
these
records
back
under
their
laws.
that
holding
is
against
us.
but
nevertheless,
there's
no
question
that
what
this
record
is
full
of
showing
that
the
purpose
of
using
this
very
private
bank
was
to
gain
the
benefit
time
after
time
in
cloaking
activities
all
over
the
world
of
the
secrecy
laws
of
the
swiss.
and
it
is
though
they
put
themselves
in
a
deliberate
position
of
using
these
laws
in
their
business
and
now
claiming
that
the
laws
keep
them
from
supplying
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
wasn't
only
projected
in
the
future.
it
was
presently
done.
they
used
this
bank
for
what
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
started
back
in
1928
when
they
became
one
of
the
so-called
“sleeping
partners”
in
this
private
bank.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
fourth
--
the
thought
is
beyond
that
that
they
thought
that
it
would
be
beneficial
at
that
very
moment
to
conceal
from
their
own
government
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
1928
for
taxation
purposes
and
all
kinds
of
currency
transactions.
and
the
other
benefits
that
they
could
obtain
from
having
the
secrecy
laws
that
they
would
run
their
transactions
through
this
private
bank
rather
than
their
own
bank
which
was
owned
by
these
parties
too.
the
house
bank
of
farben
was
even
owned
64%
by
these
people.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
have
the
problem
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
fact
that
these
laws
obviously
are
beneficial
to
banking
transactions
in
switzerland.
and
there
isn't
any
question
about
it
and
the
--
the
swiss
government
has
a
right
to
have
such
laws
and
provide
cloaks
and
secrecy
and
so
forth
and
various
people
take
advantage
of
them.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
across
and
indicate
here
is
that
if
people
do
their
business
in
that
way
and
for
that
purpose
of
secrecy,
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
come
into
an
american
court
and
say,
“we
won't
give
you
our
records
so
that
you
can
find
the
facts
about
this
transaction
because
of
these
very
laws
that
they
wanted
to
use.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
both.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
also
from
their
own
stockholders.
they
would
run
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
petitioner.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
petitioner
in
the
first
place
until
1936.
the
petitioner
was
in
a
desk
drawer
of
the
private
bank
and
there
wasn't
--
even
though
the
petitioner
was
organized
in
1929.
it
had
no
existence
as
far
as
its
affairs
were
concerned
except
to
be
in
these
private
bank
drawers
and
their
files
were
intermingled.
and
the
greutert
and
sturzenegger,
the
managers
of
the
private
bank
would
write
letters
to
themselves.
they
would
write
letters
to
chemie
in
which
they
would
write
them
then
they
would
answer
their
letters
for
chemie
and
put
them
in
the
files.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
an
effect
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
no
question
whether
the
findings
are
clear
that
they
have
these
papers
that
the
swiss
compensation
office
had
these
very
papers
for
months
in
which
they
asked
these
people,
all
about
them,
and
examine
this
whole
question
that
the
record
shows
the
fact
that
they
deliberately
use
this
bank
for
cloaking
transactions
covering
greece,
romania.
they
used
it
for
covering
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
related
also
to
farben.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
farben
through
the
petitioner
using
the
bank
in
which
there
is
a
common
interest
all
of
the
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
finding
of
good
faith
is
related
only
to
the
fact
that
they
are
not
collusive
in
getting
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
our
contention
and
i
think
that's
fully
justified.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
it's
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
didn't
produce
records
which
their
only
excuse
is
laws
of
another
country
which
are
not
binding
in
this
form
at
all.
and
therefore,
there
cannot
be
a
fair
trial
of
this
case
without
that
production
and
since
it's
apparent
that
they're
not
going
to
produce
from
their
failure
for
this
long
term
of
years,
after
a
number
of
extensions.
the
order
was
made
to
dismiss
the
case
with
prejudice
after
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
it's
just
as
though
their
excuse
was
that
we
don't
feel
like
it
today
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
don't
accept
the
finding
that
it's
based
on
the
assumption
they
couldn't
if
you
mean
by
that
that
they
had
legal
excuse
not
to.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
but
the
excuse
they
gave
is
not
--
is
as
though
they
gave
no
excuse
in
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
this
country.
there
is
no
such
right,
no
such
privilege,
the
law
of
switzerland
and
in
regards
to
secrecy
is
no
excuse
and
they
had
a
duty
to
produce
and
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
because
of
that
is
as
though
they
say
we
won't
in
the
legal
effect
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
fact
that
he
can't
do
it
is
because
of
a
law
that
has
no
recognition
in
this
forum.
he
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
also
rendered
from
--
for
the
reason
that
this
court
that
was
trying
the
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
only
interested
in
their
having
a
fair
trial
but
in
both
parties
having
a
fair
trial.
and
it
was
impossible
in
this
case
for
both
parties
to
ever
have
a
fair
trial
without
these
records.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
fact
is
that
he
takes
his
business
through
the
swiss
banks
and
places
in
the
secrecy
upon
himself.
and
he
runs
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
different
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
exactly.
that's
exactly
the
system
that
they
anticipated
that
was
operating,
all
they
were
using
it
and
could
only
have
this
kind
of
result.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
found
that
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
found
that
the
--
there
was
no
excuse
in
the
claim
of
the
fifth
--
of
the
swiss
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
--
the
records
as
justice
frankfurter
presented
are
not
available
at
all.
it's
in
complete
distinction
from
--
and
i
don't
think
the
court
was
considering
that
problem
if
the
records
were
destroyed
so
nobody
--
no
one
could
possibly
get
it.
that
would
be
something
else.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
the
court
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
don't
think
the
court
would
have
entered
any
such
order
then.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
if
i
can
develop
that
i
can
show
you
that
it's
impossible
in
this
record
and
that
it
was
plainly
conceived
by
the
parties
when
they
proceeded
as
they
did
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
place
that
this
--
the
facts
about
these
cloaking
transactions
and
their
operations
of
this
company
and
the
enemy
taint
that's
evidence
here
by
the
swiss
compensation
office
report
could
be
found
except
this
very
place
and
that's
why
they
do
business
that
way.
even
--
the
record
even
shows
that
back
in
1937,
the
german
government
inquired
in
regard
to
some
of
the
transactions
of
farben
with
this
bank
and
farben
directed
greutert,
the
manager
of
the
bank
on
how
to
answer
their
letter
and
say
that
swiss
secrecy
laws
will
not
permit
the
disclosure
of
such
information.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we're
--
in
regard
to
the
record,
we're
involved
in
a
situation
that's
a
discovery
proceeding
as
distinguished
from
a
trial
on
the
merits,
so
that
you
have
affidavits
and
you
have
the
23,000
papers
that
we
have
already
disclosed
to
them
in
accordance
with
the
court's
order
fully
and
all
of
those
are
here.
now,
what
their
answer
might
be
to
that
if
there
is
any
isn't
here
because
there
isn't
any
trial
in
the
merits.
but
that
is
--
there
isn't
any
question
with
what
--
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
district
court
would
ever
try
to
find
the
--
the
merits
of
these
particular
matters
because
that
would
have
to
be
a
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
the
difficulty
we
have
in
this
case
is
that
they
didn't
run
their
transactions
in
1936
as
i've
told
you.
they
got
chemie
out
of
being
just
a
desk
drawer
transaction
in
the
private
bank.
from
that
time
on,
they
moved
it
into
another
street
backing
up
to
the
private
bank
so
they
could
go
backdoor
to
backdoor.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
--
the
record
is
even
beyond
that.
it
has
discussions
in
which
farben
tells
the
finance
ministry
of
germany
exactly
the
kind
of
plan
that
they
want
to
follow
about
cloaking
some
of
these
transactions,
about
helping
to
build
up
the
german
armament
program
under
--
with
the
norsk
hydro
in
light
metals
in
norway
after
they
occupied
norway,
how
they
used
paris'
concern
that
--
that
this
petitioner
had
in
occupied
france
to
transact
business
of
farben.
and
farben
managed
it
all
the
time.
these
records
replete
with
that
and
it
shows
that
sturzenegger
cloaked
transactions
in
various
countries
that
he
suggested
one
of
his
associates
to
cloak
for
south
american
transactions
that
they
cloak
for
india,
britain,
australia
and
england
and
they
even
had
a
transaction
in
holland
where
they
had
a
cloaking
and
where
they
operated
in
occupied
territory.
all
of
those
things
are
indications
of
enemy
taint.
now
beyond
that,
all
of
these
various
transactions,
they
were
bear
shares
up
to
1945
and
they
will
run
through
this
bank
even
when
chemie
after
36
when
it
was
fully
established.
they
didn't
run
these
transactions
in
regard
to
the
stock
through
chemie.
beyond
on
their
books,
they're
in
the
bank's
books
according
to
the
--
the
swiss
compensation
office.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
our
position.
they
---
they
put
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
that
they
had
a
program
deliberately
and
it's
all
related
in
detail
in
these
letters
to
their
own
finance
ministry
when
they
told
about
--
they
even
talked
about
seizure
of
their
assets
and
how
they
wanted
to
conceal
them
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
known
to
--
even
the
united
states
and
great
britain
about
where
these
assets
were
so
that
they
could
take
them.
and
therefore,
they
developed
in
detail
this
program
of
how
they
would
use
these
various
schemes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
effect
of
it.if
--
it's
just
as
though
i
think
the
courts
would
find
that
if
i
would
take
some
material
that
was
a
matter
of
discovery
and
would
deliberately
drop
it
in
the
potomac
river
that
the
courts
would
say,
"well,
it's
too
bad
for
you."
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
facts
are
replete
here
very
complete
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
the
--
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
conception
of
the
master's
findings
was
that
he
found
that
they
were
not
in
conspiring
with
or
in
collaboration
with
the
swiss
government
in
getting
the
order
by
the
federal
attorney
that
they
couldn't
deliver
these
records.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
didn't
appear
to
be
an
issue
at
any
time
before
the
master.
the
master,
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
record
is
so
complete
about
that
part
of
it
and
the
fact
that
that
was
the
whole
scheme
and
program
from
the
beginning
and
that
this
was
really
just
a
farben
place
of
--
a
banking
operation
that
there
was
never
any
issue
about
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
have
the
additional
factor
in
the
case
that
they
come
with
their
claim
in
1940
to
the
treasury
in
which
they
asked
to
have
certain
of
the
stocks
sent
over
to
them
and
recognize
their
ownership,
the
treasury
in
the
united
states.
and
they
attached
to
that
claim
a
large
number
of
papers
including
about
half
of
them
in
which
they
are
papers
of
the
bank
to
support
their
claim
before
this
government
asking
for
a
certain
prop,
the
recognition
of
their
ownership
of
certain
shares.
now,
when
they
file
their
administrative
claim
in
this
case,
there
are
some
40
different
papers
that
they
file
and
better
than
a
half
of
those
are
papers,
purported
copies
of
papers
with
this
very
bank,
joint
transactions
in
order
to
make
their
chain
of
title.
then
when
they
--
they
present
their
claim
to
the
allied
military
authorities
in
--
in
berlin
to
try
to
get
back
the
title
to
their
stock
and
lender
bank,
the
farben
house
bank,
there
that
was
taken
over
by
the
government
when
we
occupied
germany.
they
put
about
--
they
put
some
50
papers
there
and
involved
17
different
people
there
in
transaction
with
this
very
bank
in
support
of
that
claim.
then
when
they
--
sturzenegger
testifies
before
the
--
in
his
deposition,
he
proceeds
to
say
that
he
will
waive
on
behalf
of
some
75
different
persons,
any
claim
of
secrecy
in
connection
with
that.
then
he
backs
up
on
that
waiver
and
says
that
he
doesn't
want
to
agree
to
that
after
he
goes
along
with
his
deposition
for
a
while.
and
he
asserts
later
during
the
deposition
that
the
secrecy
laws
prohibited
even
answering
questions.
and
we
take
that
to
the
court
and
judge
bailey
held
that
that
was
no
excuse
that
he
had
to
answer
the
questions
so
that
we
find
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
whenever
they
can
use
the
swiss
secrecy
laws
for
their
benefit,
they
seemed
to
be
no
handicap
at
all.
they
can
produce
the
papers
for
their
claim.
they
can
produce
them
for
the
treasury.
they
can
produce
them
for
the
allied
military
authorities.
but
when
we
need
them
to
trace
out
step
by
state
--
step,
the
ownership
of
the
stock
and
the
enemy
taint
that's
replete
in
this
record
of
cloaking
of
all
kinds,
we
can't
have
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
the
limited
--
the
hearing
was
limited
only
to
the
question
of
good
faith
in
connection
with
this
order.
now,
that
is
quite
different.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
--
no,
the
order
--
there
had
been
an
order
by
the
federal
attorney
that
the
--
the
records
could
not
be
delivered
up
and
that
was
not
a
physical
taking
but
it
was
an
order
that
the
federal
attorney
had
made
and
the
court
recognized
that
these
nationals
were
bound
by
it
by
his
finding
but
if
the
hearing
was
limited
to
that.
now,
what
all
was
done
in
regard
to
how
they
set
up
this
whole
matter
and
that
they
were
planning
to
use
this
very
device
was
so
apparent
in
the
record.
there
was
--
it
didn't
appear
there'd
be
any
reason
for
a
hearing
in
regard
to
that.
the
--
they've
--
even
after
they
got
the
petitioner
established
as
a
holding
company
in
1936,
they
continued
to
run
every
single
stock
transaction
through
this
private
bank
and
the
only
possible
purpose,
the
only
inference
you
can
possibly
draw
from
it
is
that
they
want
to
have
this
covered.
and
of
course
it's
revealed
by
their
own
letters
to
their
finance
ministry
when
they
say
they
hardly
want
to
cloak
all
these
various
transactions.
so
it's
--
it's
very
apparent
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
enemy
taint
that
appears
in
these
records
that
have
been
produced.
we
can't
trace
out
the
ownership
of
the
stock
but
there's
no
question
that
went
up
to
1940.
it
was
germany
and
that's
clearly
established.
then
the
question
is
what
happened
between
1940,
in
april
of
1942
when
the
investment
took
place.
how
in
the
world
did
it
get
to
be?
this
is
$100
million
we're
talking
about.
how
did
it
become
swiss
all
of
a
sudden
after
it
was
german
until
1940?
and
then
we
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
--
but
i'm
only
pointing
this
out
to
show
you
how
it's
impossible
to
try
this
case
fairly
toward
--
certainly
toward
the
other
party
of
the
government
without
these
records
when
this
is
the
only
place
when
these
--
for
these
transactions
ran
through.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
finding
of
good
faith
on
that
question.
i
think
the
faith
--
the
only
finding
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
that
the
record
is
so
clear
on
this
point
because
here
is
the
lender
bank,
that's
one
--
the
private
bank
of
farben
in
berlin.
now
--
and
so
part
of
the
scheme,
they
put
64%
of
that
bank
in
this
swiss
banking
concern.
now,
certainly
this
--
anybody
that's
working
with
this
case,
any
court
has
got
a
right
to
assume
there's
plenty
of
banking
arrangements
available
in
germany
for
farben
to
use
without
having
to
go
into
the
swiss
bank
and
a
private
bank
that
only
has
farben
people
in
it
at
that.
but
in
addition
to
it,
they
had
their
own
house
bank,
this
lender
bank,
which
they
ran
through
a
lot
of
transactions.
and
also
this
record
shows
that
they
instructed
all
the
remittances
to
be
sent
through
this
bank
and
not
even
have
a
sign
on
it
that
they
had
any
connection
with
farben.
that's
clear
in
this
record
that
they
gave
it,
it's
an
expressed
instruction
to
everybody
that
remitted
one
cent
to
them
during
the
war
period
that
they
shouldn't
even
indicate
who
had
--
that
farben
had
any
ownership
whatsoever.
now,
why
in
the
world
would
they
do
that
if
they
weren't
trying
to
hide
and
keep
secret
exactly
what
they
were
doing
the
--
for
the
purposes
of
their
currency,
taxation
and
all
the
rest?
and
then
they
tell
this
banker
just
how
to
answer
the
question
when
their
own
government
inquires.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
said
at
that
time
more
than
that
because
we
said
that
there
was
a
further
lack
of
good
faith
in
this
regard
that
they
claimed
--
you
--
you've
heard
counsel
described
all
of
his
waivers
that
they
were
--
they
have
secured.
and
they
secured
some
and
the
record
shows
that
there
are
good
many
that
they
didn't
so
they
couldn't
produce
a
good
many
of
these
papers
that
they're
talking
about,
they
say.
but
we
said,
here
you
are
you
have
--
you
say
that
the
waivers
are
available
but
you
haven't
even
asked
anyone
whether
or
not
they
waived.
you've
made
no
effort
or
whatsoever
to
get
any
waivers
from
anybody.
you
haven't
even
appealed
this
order
of
the
federal
attorney
as
the
law
provides
that
you
have
a
right
to.
how
can
you
say
you're
acting
in
good
faith
when
you
did
not
even
try
those
things,
let
alone
these
other
claims
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
agree
that
i
can't
but
i
want
to
show
you
why
we
claimed
that
there
was
a
lack
of
faith
in
that
area
because
they
hadn't
tried
to
get
any
waivers
and
they
haven't
ever
tried
to
appeal
and
they
--
we
claim
that
chemie,
the
petitioner,
could
also
have
a
right
to
appeal
as
well
as
sturzenegger
and
that
neither
one
of
them
have.
and
later,
they
both
appealed
and
they
were
both
turned
down
and
later
they
went
to
work
on
waivers
and
so
forth,
but
that
was
the
issue
before
the
master
in
regard
to
the
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
trying
to
adhere
to
the
line,
mr.
justice
harlan
that
we
don't
--
we
think
the
findings
are
against
us
on
the
proposition
that
there
was
any
collusion
that
--
that
they
produced
this
federal
attorney's
order.
well,
we
do
think
the
record
is
replete
with
a
showing
that
that
--
the
whole
plan
was
to
use
this
private
bank
and
the
secrecy
that
could
be
obtained
not
only
for
this
purpose
which
they
were
smart
enough
to
anticipate
too
as
this
record
shows
but
also
for
the
day
by
day
benefits.
i'll
show
you
how
it
worked
instead
of
running
it
through
the
regular
bank
accounts.
they
also
ran
it
through
what
they
called
"custodian
accounts"
or
sort
of
joint
venture
accounts
in
which
they
wouldn't
even
have
to
set
that
up
on
the
bank
records
when
they
made
their
public
statements
about
the
assets
and
the
liabilities
of
the
bank.
and
then
they
would
run
these
various
--
these
items
through
the
account
in
that
manner
and
they
wouldn't
have
to
account
to
the
petitioner's
stockholders
for
the
earnings
on
those
items.
so
that
they
held
those
--
those
amounts
in
those
special
custodian
accounts
and
the
record,
there's
no
dispute
about
this
that
they
would
keep
that
amount
never
account
to
their
stockholders
until
they
were
short
on
earnings
otherwise
and
then
they
would
pull
it
out
of
the
special
account
and
pay
a
dividend
out
of
it
so
that
they
got
out
of
accounting
to
their
stockholders,
accounting
to
the
tax
authorities,
accounting
to
the
public
generally
for
--
in
regard
to
the
bank
statement
and
whatever
obligation
they
would
have
to
german
authorities
and
its
currency
control.
all
of
those
things
they
got
out
by
using
this
bank,
this
device
instead
of
running
it
through
the
ordinary
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
claim
that.
the
only
element
of
that
that
there
is
--
there
is
a
considerable
contradiction
in
this
case
and
they
are
being
able
to
--
whenever
they
want
to
present
a
claim
like
they
have
with
their
administrative
claim
when
they
filed
with
the
treasury
and
when
they
filed
in
germany
in
making
claims,
they
always
seemed
to
be
able
to
get
all
the
records
out
of
this
bank
to
which
--
that
would
give
their
chain
of
title.but
when
we
need
them
to
try
to
check
back
on
their
story
and
prove
this
enemy
taint
and
ownership,
we
just
can't
possibly
get
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
the
two
lower
courts
thought
that
the
matter
of
due
process
in
this
case
involved
the
matter
--
the
question
of
fair
trial
to
both
sides.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
they
had
to
go
that
far
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
i
also
have
the
position
that
i
tried
to
describe
in
the
case
of
the
ordinary
swiss
roschmann
who
does
his
--
his
banking
business
with
his
swiss
bank
and
is
a
national
of
switzerland.
and
by
reason
of
that
when
he
wants
to
prove
something,
he's
unable
to
produce
the
records
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
what
i
was
trying
to
point
out
was
that
the
court
went
that
far
and
felt
that
that
was
sufficient
that
is
was
necessary
as
a
matter
of
due
process
that
both
sides
have
a
fair
trial.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
--
there's
always
that
possibility
of
course.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
action
of
the
court
should
not
be
lightly
discarded
because
of
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
basically
was
saying
it's
clear
from
this
--
in
this
case,
in
the
records
that
are
before
it
that
that's
impossible
to
try
to
find
out
the
truth
about
enemy
taint
and
--
and
enemy
ownership
of
this
stock
without
knowing
the
facts
in
this
particular
bank
and
getting
all
of
these
records.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
my
belief
that
the
court
was
satisfied
here
that
they
--
that
this
case
--
these
papers
were
decisive
and
so
held
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
government
to
trace
out
this
enemy
taint
like
the
case
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
the
government
would
not
want
to
claim
that
it
had
the
record
to
trace
out
that
there
was
no
change
in
ownership
that
ever
occurred
before
this
got
over
to
be
a
swiss
in
these
papers.
and
i
don't
think
that
a
court
would
want
to
hold
in
this
case
without
examination
of
these
other
records
that
the
claim
of
these
--
that
the
petitioner
that
it
--
that
the
swiss
own
the
stock
now
would
be
determined
on
this
record
as
it
is
because
there's
no
question
about
the
german
ownership
up
to
1940.
the
swiss
compensation
office
report
would
indicate
that
as
much
as
$100
million
of
farben
money
ran
through
this
bank
at
various
times
and
whether
or
not
how
it
ever
got
over
to
be
swiss
is
only
explained
by
a
very
short
statement
in
the
report
in
which
they
indicate
that
this
--
a
large
sum
of
money
about
$130
million
francs
was
made
by
the
swiss
by
using
farben
assets
and
getting
special
tips
on
what
investments
to
make
and
so
forth.
and
that's
all
there
is
and
they
don't
break
it
down
to
show
how
the
transactions
were
or
anything
about
it.
now,
i
would
think
that
any
court
would
hesitate
on
this
record
alone
to
decide
that
the
claim
of
the
swiss
that
they
did
somehow
get
to
own
the
stock
was
untrue
without
these
records
in
which
they
say
it's
clear
from
this
record,
these
various
transactions
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
that's
the
court's
finding
that
these
records
would
probably
be
decisive
of
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
happened
to
us
when
we
got
--
when
we
got
the
petitioner's
records.
we
found
that
he
--
they
manufactured
their
books
and
they
had
--
they
had
record
books
that
clearly
showed
that
when
they
had
the
originals
they
had
13
journals
and
it
showed
references
back
and
forth.
it's
all
set
out
in
the
record.
the
ones
they
gave
us
were
only
11
books.
and
on
the
cover
page,
the
inside
cover
page
of
each
one
of
these
journals,
it
says
the
date
--
that
the
stationer
delivered
the
book
to
the
petitioner
and
the
date
of
the
delivery
is
anywhere
from
one
month
to
22
months
after
the
dates
of
the
entries
inside.
then
when
they
delivered
the
other
papers
to
us
there
are
over
9000
we
were
able
to
check
on,
but
they
didn't
deliver
it
all.
they
came
up
later
with
some
5000
additional.
now,
you
--
in
this
kind
of
a
matter
where
you're
trying
to
run
out
cloaking
transactions,
you're
trying
to
run
out
items
of
investment
in
stocks
and
bonds
over
a
long
period
of
time
from
at
least
1936
and
it
goes
back
at
least
1931
on.
you
could
take
any
item
down
the
line.
they
even
talked
about
giving
us
book
and
they'll
blank
out
the
lines
they
can't
get
consent
to.
and
if
i
could
do
that
in
any
kind
of
a
case
and
just
blank
out
the
lines
where
the
transaction
ran
back
the
other
way
could
be
absolutely
meaningless.
you
just
can't
run
out
of
cloaking
transaction
in
that
manner.
now,
they
suggest
to
us
that
we
should
--
the
other
thing
they
suggest
is
that
we
have
a
--
a
person
that's
appointed
by
the
swiss
government
sworn
to
assist
the
swiss
secrecy
law.he's
going
to
abide
by
that.
he's
going
to
examine
these
records
and
then
he's
going
to
determine
relevancy.
now,
just
think
what
that
means
to
american
court.
here's
a
man,
a
swiss,
he's
going
to
determine
relevancy
for
an
american
court.
and
if
i
could
determine
relevancy,
i
don't
think
the
judicial
function
would
amount
too
much
for
the
court
but
he
is
going
to
decide
that.
and
then
we're
going
to
try
according
to
plan.
we'll
go
into
the
court
and
see
if
by
letters
rogatory
we
can
force
them
to
give
these
up
in
spite
of
the
swiss
laws
and
we'll
see
how
many
we
get
and
then
we
run
down
the
various
transactions.
and
of
course,
if
anybody
is
going
to
give
us
manufactured
books
because
there
isn't
any
question
for
what
we
have
here,
we're
not
going
to
get
the
key
transactions
that
tell
what
they
did
in
the
cloaking.
and
that's
the
reason
we
haven't
got
these
books
and
did
it
--
this
isn't
--
all
these
just
happened
in
six
months
ago.this
is
going
on
for
practically
10
years.
and
if
they
could
afford
to
let
us
see
these
books
in
every
piece
of
paper
and
it
would
sustain
their
claim,
they've
been
here
long
ago.
there's
$100
million
involved.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
there's
only
one
problem
in
that
that
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of
and
that
is
the
restriction
on
the
government
doing
anything
with
the
property
during
a
time
there's
any
pending
litigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
statutes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
statute
provides
that
as
long
as
there's
pending
litigation,
you
can't.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
so,
as
far
as
they're
concerned,
if
they
can
get
that
kind
of
an
arrangement,
they're
just
as
well
off
as
though
they
just
defeat
or
doing
anything
with
it
so
that
the
court
had
to
face
up
eventually
to
the
proposition
that
they're
either
going
to
have
a
fair
trial
in
this
or
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
think
legally
the
problem
is
that
the
--
they
have
to
comply
with
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
trading
--
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
it's
--
the
burdens
on
them
to
prove
their
case
and
if
--
to
bring
in
their
papers.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
the
discovery
rules,
the
whole
concept
of
our
trial
procedure
under
discovery
rules
is
to
try
to
get
at
the
facts
and
the
truth.
and
the
reason
for
allowing
discovery
in
advance
of
trial
is
to
try
to
search
out
what
the
real
issues
are
and
the
facts
are
so
that
you
can
prepare
for
trial.
now,
we
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
also
say
that
if
they're
perfectly
innocent
that
the
swiss
law
of
secrecy
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
united
states,
they
have
to
--
they
have
come
into
this
forum
to
sue.
they're
coming
affirmatively
here.
therefore,
they
have
to
comply
with
the
law
of
the
forum
in
regard
to
procedure
and
the
law
that
forum
is
that
you
make
discovery
not
only
that
you
have
a
trial
on
the
merits
but
before
you
get
to
that
point
you've
got
to
let
the
other
fellow
have
the
record
so
he
can
prepare
for
trial.
now,
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
--
if
he
is
innocent
and
he
doesn't
produce
his
papers,
he
still
has
not
complied
with
the
discovery
and
that
is
one
of
the
requirements
of
our
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what's
happened
up
to
date.
they
have
--
the
record
is
clear
that
they
did
produce
the
papers
three
different
times
in
regard
to
these
various
transactions
within
this
very
bank.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
they
--
nothing
to
help
our
defense.
we
had
to
get
that
from
other
places
as
much
as
we
could
and
we've
got
to
in
order
to
really
have
our
defense,
we've
got
to
find
every
piece
of
paper
that
shows
this
transaction
in
and
out
of
this
bank
that
this
--
this
party
is
interested
in.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
we
haven't.
there's
no
indication.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that.
