mr.
john
j.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
dismissed
with
prejudice
by
the
district
court
at
the
pre-trial
stage,
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
discovery
order
in
a
situation
in
which
due
to
no
cause
in
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner
was
unable
to
comply
with
the
order.
i
should
like
to
discuss
a
few
of
the
procedural
facts
first
before
i
come
to
the
principles
of
law
which
i
think
are
controlling
here.
this
petitioner
is
a
swiss
holding
corporation
which
filed
suit
in
1948
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
to
recover
most
of
the
stock
of
general
aniline
&
film
corporation,
an
american
company.
the
respondents
filed
answers
in
which
they
alleged
that
the
petitioner
was
"enemy
tainted"
and
did
not
own
the
property.
the
requirements
being
that
the
petitioner
was
holding
the
property
as
"for
ig
farben
of
germany".
shortly
after
the
complaint
was
instituted,
cross
motions
were
filed
for
discovery.
and
the
court
--
the
district
court
required
the
custodian
to
disclose
to
the
petitioner
a
quantity
of
some
23,000
relevant
documents
in
its
--
his
possession.
at
the
same
time,
the
respondents
had
moved
not
only
for
the
discovery
of
the
petitioner's
own
records
and
those
of
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
but
the
records
of
a
private
swiss
bank
known
as
sturzenegger
&
company
in
basel,
switzerland
with
which
the
petitioner
had
close
business
relations.
it
was
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
its
records
were
relevant.
it
made
no
resistance
to
the
motion
for
the
production
of
its
own
records.
it
resisted
vigorously
the
request
that
it
produced
the
records
of
the
swiss
bank
upon
the
ground
that
it
did
not
have
possession,
custody
or
control
of
those
records
as
required
by
rule
34
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
we
also
raised
the
point
with
the
court
invoking
the
exercise
of
a
benign
discretion
that
due
to
the
banking
secrecy
laws
of
switzerland,
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
even
should
the
bank
voluntarily
produce
--
would
be
willing
to
give
up
the
records
for
us
to
obtain
them
for
inspection.
we
also
resisted
the
imposition
of
this
discovery
order
as
far
as
the
sturzenegger
bank
was
concerned
upon
the
ground
of
an
inadequate
designation
of
the
records.
and
so
it
happens
that
this
element
of
control,
which
we
say
was
never
properly
resolved
against
us
and
the
proper
designation
of
the
records
to
be
produce
are
basic
difficulties
here
that
appointed
us
throughout
in
this
whole
case.
judge
laws
heard
arguments
in
our
position
to
the
production
of
the
sturzenegger
records.
now,
sturzenegger
who
was
the
managing
partner
of
this
private
swiss
bank
is
one
of
the
principal
directors
of
the
petitioner.now,
i
think
that
had
a
great
influence
with
the
district
judge
in
imposing
upon
the
petitioner
a
requirement
that
it
produce
not
only
its
own
records
but
the
records
of
this
private
swiss
bank.
now,
prior
to
the
institution
of
our
suit,
an
agency
of
the
swiss
government
known
as
the
swiss
compensation
office
had
made
an
investigation
into
the
national
character
of
both
sturzenegger
and
the
petitioner
and
several
reports
were
issued
in
which
it
was
determined
that
these
companies
were
swiss
in
character.
the
principal
reason
i
believe
why
the
respondents
urge
the
court
to
include
in
its
discovery
order
against
us,
the
requirement
that
we
produce,
the
records
of
the
private
swiss
bank
partnership,
was
because
this
business
relationship
which
the
petitioner
had
with
the
swiss
bank
was
not
only
that
of
having
the
swiss
bank
as
its
house
bank
but
it
also
had
a
participation
in
the
partnership
of
this
bank.
now,
the
bank
was
a
--
had
two
partners
and
the
participation
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
not
the
sturzenegger.
it
was
the
unlimited
partner,
the
general
managing
partner
was
a
small
swiss
franc
investment.
a
corporation
known
as
"industry
bank,"
which
was
not
a
bank
but
a
swiss
corporation,
was
a
limited
partner
with
a
large
swiss
franc
investment.
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
what
is
known
as
a
"sleeping
participation,‚Äù
a
thing
which
is
unknown
to
anglo-saxon
law
but
has
its
roots
perhaps
in
german
law.
and
we
have
maintained
throughout
that
it
is
more
akin
to
that
of
an
investment
than
it
is
to
a
sound
partner
or
any
kind
of
a
partner.
now
fortunately
for
us,
we
did
not
have
to
rely
upon
oral
testimony
as
to
the
terms
of
the
so-called
partnership
agreements.there
were
successively
three
or
four,
they
have
been
before
the
court,
they
had
written
out
great
detail.
no
one
has
suggestion
--
suggested
that
they
are
any
wise
not
genuine.
and
those
agreements
spell
out
this
very
limited
participation
of
the
petitioner,
practically
no
say
in
the
management,
a
veto
on
certain
kinds
of
unusual
loans.
and
upon
the
point
of
the
ability
to
see
the
books
and
records
of
the
partnership,
a
very
unusual
provision
exists
and
that
is
it
provides
that
the
delegates
of
the
respective
participants,
industry
bank,
the
limited
partner
on
the
one
hand,
the
petitioner
with
the
participation
on
the
other.
their
delegates
could
examine
the
books
and
records
of
the
partnership
but
they
had
to
keep
secret
in
which
they
saw.
now,
a
very
unusual
provision
to
the
point
of
view
of
anglo-saxon
law
but
one
which
my
implication
spells
out
something
of
very
great
importance
to
us,
namely,
that
the
petitioner
had
no
control
over
the
books
and
records
of
the
bank.
and
thus,
it
was
unable
to
produce
them
by
contract
or
by
law
or
by
any
other
arrangement
in
switzerland.
despite
our
resistance
of
this
imposition
of
this
order
upon
us
for
discovery,
we
were
ordered
in
1949
to
produce
our
own
records
and
those
records
and
the
records
of
the
sturzenegger
bank.we
made
our
examination
of
the
government's
records
first.
the
deposition
of
dr.
sturzenegger
which
had
been
in
progress
prior
to
that
time
was
resumed
and
completed
to
the
extent
of
over
6000
pages
of
testimony.
we
are
now
reaching
the
summer
of
1950.
at
this
time,
the
gentlemen
from
the
department
of
justice
are
proceeding
to
switzerland
for
the
purpose
of
making
inspection
which
the
court
directed.
before
they
arrive
there
about
the
15th
of
june
1950,
the
swiss
federal
attorney
who
is
the
second
man
in
command
of
the
justice
department
of
switzerland,
issued
a
confiscation
order
based
upon
what's
called
preventive
police
power
in
switzerland
and
referring
to
the
bank
secrecy
laws
and
the
economic
espionage
laws
of
switzerland
and
expressly
seizing
and
confiscating
all
the
records
of
the
swiss
bank
to
prevent
their
disclosure
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
this
case.
now,
respondent's
counsel
examined
the
records
of
the
petitioner.now,
there
is
some
contest
as
to
whether
they
saw
all
of
them
but
that's
not
in
dispute
in
this
proceeding.
in
the
fall
of
1950,
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
on
the
ground
that
we
had
not
complied
with
the
order
for
discovery.
and
in
the
hearing
before
the
district
court
at
that
time,
the
district
--
the
issue
was
raised
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
denied
and
conspired
with
the
government
of
switzerland
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
this
seizure
order.
it
was
also
argued
that
this
was
an
illegal
order.
it
was
also
argued
that
the
petitioner
had
done
little
or
nothing
to
be
relieved
of
the
order.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
it
was
a
constructive
seizure
only,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
but
i
think
that
the
parties
in
this
case
have
clearly
dealt
with
the
proposition
as
if
it
were
an
actual
physical
seizure.i
think
that
this
court
should
regard
it
as
the
equivalent
of
an
actual
physical
seizure.
justice
laws
--
judge
laws
referred
this
matter
to
a
special
master
to
take
testimony
but
then
ensued
a
very
long
proceeding
in
the
cause
of
which
it
was
found
that
there
was
oddly
no
evidence
of
any
conspiracy
between
the
swiss
government
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
it
was
found
that
the
seizure
was
valid
under
the
preventive
police
power
of
switzerland.
it
was
found
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
done
everything
which
he
could
be
expected
to
do
to
try
and
have
them
relieved
of
the
order.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
report,
the
petitioner
moved
for
its
ratification.
the
respondents
came
in
and
filed
exceptions
but
renewed
their
motion
to
dismiss
upon
the
ground
that
even
if
it
were
found
that
the
petitioner
were
in
entire
good
faith
that
our
inability
to
produce
these
records
had
disrupted
the
established
procedures
which
were
in
effect
that
when
a
litigant
comes
into
court,
it
should
be
prepared
to
make
full
disclosure.
and
despite
our
complete
inability
and
our
innocence
in
the
situation,
the
suit
should
be
dismissed.
in
february
of
1953,
judge
laws
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
he
had
adopted
that
philosophy.
he
announced
however
that
this
was
a
novel
doctrine
and
that
he
would
give
the
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
try
to
get
the
records.
and
so
he
extended
the
time
for
approximately
three
months.
in
the
meantime,
certain
petitions
have
been
filed
with
the
swiss
federal
authorities
in
an
effort
to
try
to
pry
these
records
loose.
and
it
began
to
develop
that
if
we
could
obtain
the
waivers
and
consents
from
the
bank
customers
who
in
swiss
--
one
of
the
owners
of
the
banking
secret.
under
the
supervision
of
the
federal
government,
these
records
might
be
released
or
some
of
them
might
be
released.
so
we
pursued
that
course
for
several
months
in
1953
and
we're
able
to
ship
over
here
some
63,000
records
within
--
sought
more
time
because
this
is
a
very
tedious
process.
and
it
began
to
develop
but
not
only
did
we
need
the
primary
records
of
the
custom
of
the
bank
--
primary
consents
of
the
custom
of
the
bank.
but
if
to
payee
of
the
check
was
involved,
we
call
that
a
"secondary
waiver."
we
needed
his
waiver
and
his
will.
so
in
the
fall
of
1953,
on
one
of
our
motions
to
extend
the
time
ought
to
be
relieved
upon
--
of
the
order
upon
the
basis
of
substantial
compliance,
the
court
asked
whether
we
could
give
any
assurance
as
to
whether
we
could
then
get
full
compliance.
i
told
the
district
judge
that
i
could
not
give
him
that
assurance
but
that
i'd
never
given
up
hope
and
that
was
the
opportunity
to
continue.
strangely
enough
and
this
is
a
paradox
in
a
case
which
is
full
of
paradoxes
that
the
district
judge
said
i
think
from
this
situation
in
switzerland
where
you
lack
control
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
get
these
records.
so
we
might
as
well
save
you
this
frustrating
effort
which
you
have
been
making
for
years
and
we
have
just
dismissed
the
case
finally.
now,
mind
you
if
the
court
please.
the
paradox
that
i
referred
to
is
this
element
of
control
which
judge
laws
had
find
--
found
only
prima
facie
to
exist
when
he
issued
the
order
in
july
of
1949
and
which
he
had
defined
in
order
to
support
the
legality
of
the
discovery
order
under
rule
34.
he
found
later
on
that
the
absence
of
that
control
was
the
reason
why
we
couldn't
produce
and
why
we
should
be
dismissed.
now,
as
a
result
of
that,
we
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
was
argued
and
submitted
and
decided
in
june
of
1955.
it
was
affirmed
in
its
entirety
with
the
modification
allowing
us
six
months
from
the
time
that
the
mandate
came
down
in
which
we
tried
to
get
the
records.
now,
we
intended
to
apply
for
certiorari
and
we
stayed
the
mandate
and
did
apply
to
this
court
for
certiorari.certiorari
was
denied
in
january
of
1956.
the
six
months
began
to
run
on
the
24th
of
january
1956
and
so
we
began
again
previously
to
--
by
this
waiver
and
consent
method
to
get
records.
and
by
june
of
1956,
we
had
produced
in
this
country
and
tendered
for
inspection
almost
200,000
banking
records
of
the
sturzenegger
bank.
now,
i
said
earlier
and
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
it,
our
brief
is
clear
on
it,
that
the
court's
designation
was
unclear.
there
was
no
designation
of
all
the
records
of
the
bank.
there
was
a
designation
based
upon
certain
language
in
the
swiss
compensation
and
all
the
reports.
there's
a
great
controversy
about
how
many
records
we
had
to
produce.
there'd
be
a
great
controversy
as
to
when
we
had
made
full
production.i
can't
assure
this
court
for
200,000
of
the
full
production
but
i
don't
have
to
use
any
argument
to
submit
that
200,000
are
substantial
compliance
for
the
discovery
order.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
yes,
indeed.
time
and
time
again,
sir.
time
and
time
again.
now,
we
came
in
--
mr.
john
j.
wilson
banking
records,
correspondents,
debit
and
credit
tickets.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
two
hundred
thousand
--
200,000
separate
pieces
of
paper
or
if
a
--
if
a
document
consisted
of
three
papers,
sheets,
that
would
have
only
one
number.
now,
we
--
mr.
john
j.
wilson
we
had
conceded
more
or
less
at
the
beginning
that
all
the
documents
were
relevant.
now,
it
would
turn
out
that
all
the
documents
were
not
relevant.
there
was
no
sympathy
upon
the
death
of
somebody,
things
like
that
in
the
file.
there'd
be
paid
gas
bills
or
electric
bills.
but
nevertheless,
on
the
whole
it
was
or
less
conceded
that
the
--
all
the
records
of
the
sturzenegger
bank
called
for
by
this
discovery
order.now
mind
you
that
doesn't
mean
all
the
records.
all
the
records
called
for
were
virtually
relevant.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
no,
sir.
there
is
no
estimate.
and
we
have
no
access
to
the
swiss
bank's
records
except
as
--
as
we
may
get
them
through
these
consents
and
waivers.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
oh,
yes.
it's
under
the
supervision
of
the
swiss
authorities.
the
bank
had
to
keep
photostatic
copies.
the
originals
were
sent
to
the
united
states.
we
have
them
in
our
office.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
yes,
but
largely
based
without
question
upon
the
waivers
and
consents
of
the
customers.
there
weren't
many
--
mr.
john
j.
wilson
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
no,
sir.
this
private
swiss
bank
had
a
small
number
of
customers
and
that's
one
way
that
we
began
to
solicit
these
waivers.
my
opponent
suggested
a
list
of
a
124
names
which
they
said
--
they
dare
said
represented
the
totality
of
all
the
customers.
so
we
started
to
solicit
with
those
124
names.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
i
should
say
that
it's
close
to
125
or
150.
now,
each
time
that
we
produce
records
we
file
an
affidavit
giving
the
names
of
the
customers
involved
in
the
document.
they're
in
the
record
in
this
case.
i
didn't
help
them
but
i'm
sure
that's
over
100.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
the
production
order
is
printed
sir
in
the
--
in
the
first
volume
at
339.
now,
when
we
went
in
--
or
i
should
say
that
here
he
work
--
sir?
mr.
john
j.
wilson
of
course
that's
always
the
practical
inquiry.
my
opponents
argue
that
quantity
is
not
important.
it's
quality.
and
my
answer
to
that
is
take
a
look
at
what
we've
given
you,
what
we've
offered
you.
you
see
my
opponents
have
never
looked
at
these
pages.
they
have
stood
by
with
the
assurance
of
the
district
court
that
with
this
quantity
of
papers
was
now
--
it's
about
a
quarter
of
a
million
but
they
do
not
have
to
look
at
these
records
until
every
jot
and
tittle
is
produced.
now,
let
me
say
that
the
question
of
production,
substantial
production
is
a
secondary
question
in
this
case.
the
constitutional
question
is
by
far,
i
submit,
a
more
important
question.
but
i
wanted
to
give
you
these
factual
details
in
order
that
you
may
understand
what's
coming
in
the
way
of
this
constitutional
argument.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
they
used
the
phrase,
‚Äúwe
dare
say
that
these
names
represent
the
totality.‚Äù
mr.
john
j.
wilson
no,
i
would
say,
i'm
guessing
mr.
justice
brennan
but
i
think
if
we
count
it,
it
would
be
over
125
because
we
ran
in
the
secondary
waivers.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
most
of
them,
probably
not
every
one
of
them
but
most
of
them.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
i
should
say
a
dozen
maybe
but
that's
a
guess,
but
i'm
not
too
far
off.
i
don't
think.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
i
would
not
like
to
assure
your
honor
that
we
did,
no.
i
would
think
if
i
had
to
guess
that
we
came
might
even
close
in
the
case
of
some
instances
of
all
--
mr.
john
j.
wilson
i
don't
know.
because
you
see,
when
we
run
into
these
secondary
waivers
and
we
weren't
sure
that
the
waiver
of
farben
for
example
would
release
all
of
farben's
records.
we
think
that
it
did
98%
of
it
but
there
might
be
a
few
left
there.
i
do
not
wish
to
represent
to
this
court
that
we
made
a
total
production.
but
i
do
want
to
represent
to
this
court
that
we
made
a
very
substantial
production
and
that
until
these
records
are
examined,
we
should
not
be
kept
in
this
position
of
dismissal
until
it
is
determined
how
serious,
if
it
all,
the
omissions
are.
now,
we
have
a
plan
if
you
please
for
the
production
of
the
balance.
in
june,
when
we
began
to
see
that
the
six
months
were
lapsing,
we
moved
for
more
time,
we
reported
this
production.
by
this
time,
we've
had
our
swiss
associates
who
had
certain
contacts
with
the
swiss
government
and
a
plan
was
evolved
whereby
the
swiss
government
propose
that
a
neutral
investigator
selected
with
the
approval
of
the
american
court,
the
swiss
authorities,
the
department
of
justice
and
ourselves
would
go
into
the
sturzenegger
bank,
see
the
balance
of
the
records
that
are
relevant,
seek
waivers
of
those
people
and
in
cases
where
they
did
not
succeed
then
we
might
proceed
by
letters
rogatory
which
would
have
the
effect
of
invoking
judicial
assistance
in
the
swiss
courts.
now
interestingly
enough,
the
courts
of
the
different
cantons
of
switzerland
vary
on
this
point
but
the
court
of
basel
where
the
swiss
bank
was
located,
would
permit
the
invasion
of
banking
secrecy
in
a
court
proceeding.
and
so
the
scheme
or
plan
which
was
proposed
was
one
which
would
get
us
into
the
judicial
stream
in
switzerland
by
letters
rogatory.
and
thus,
we
hoped
produce
the
remainder
of
the
relevant
sturzenegger
documents.
that
plan
was
rejected
by
judge
laws.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
from
the
judgment
of
affirmance
that
we
came
to
this
court.
now
by
this
time,
we
had
produced
as
i
say
a
quarter
of
a
million
papers.
the
government
had
made
other
elaborate
discoveries.
they
had
taken
dr.
sturzenegger's
deposition
as
i
said
or
6000
pages.
they
had
made
discoveries
of
their
own.
we
made
a
tender
to
the
department
of
justice
of
these
records
remove
the
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
if
these
were
not
substantial
compliance.
he
summarily
disposed
of
the
matter
by
not
granting
our
motions.
now,
the
sturzenegger
books
are
very
much
in
the
minds
of
the
department
of
justice.
and
there
were
110
sturzenegger
books
involved
which
were
never
brought
over
but
which
we
tendered
to
them
to
the
extent
that
the
waivers
and
consents
permitted
inspection.
so
on
about
the
3rd
of
august
of
1956,
we
made
a
tender
of
these
records
and
of
the
sturzenegger
books
to
the
extent
available.and
we
asked
judge
laws
to
determine
that
this
was
substantial
compliance,
as
i
say,
he
refused
to
do
it.
he
maintained
the
same
attitude
that
he
did
before
as
did
the
gentleman
from
the
department
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
them
to
look
at
one
paper
until
they
could
be
assured
of
all
of
it.
now,
that's
my
factual
basis
which
i
think
will
be
adequate
for
my
presentation
of
--
of
certain
law
points.
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
in
its
order
it
asks
us
to
discuss
amongst
other
things,
the
power
of
the
court
--
to
dismiss
and
the
propriety
of
the
dismissal
under
rule
37
for
failure
to
obey
in
the
absence
of
evidence
and
the
finding
of
refusal
to
obey.
now,
we
find
the
gradual
thought
with
the
basic
findings
in
this
case.
time
will
not
permit
me
to
discuss
those
but
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
why
we
think
judge
laws
made
inadequate
findings
and
no
findings
at
all
on
the
original
order
of
discovery.
but
if
there
is
one
thing
about
which
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case,
it
is
that
we
had
no
power
to
produce
these
records.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
well,
from
the
composite
of
everything
that's
said,
mr.
justice
black,
i
say
without
much
fear
of
contradiction
that
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
we
did
not
have
the
physical
capacity
to
produce
these
records
after
the
seizure
order
if
you
understand.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
exactly.
now,
there
are
three
--
there
are
three
points
of
control
in
this
case.
we
attack
control
at
the
original
level,
the
factual
control,
the
lack
of
contractual
control.
we
also
raised
the
question
of
lack
of
control
as
a
result
of
the
seizure
by
the
swiss
federal
attorney.
that's
the
main
element
of
control
which
i'm
arguing
today
to
this
court.
now
in
this
special
master's
findings
and
conclusions,
he
reported
also
that
the
cause
of
the
swiss
secrecy
laws
which
made
it
necessary
that
the
customers
of
banks
shall
consent
to
the
release
of
banking
secrets
but
there
was
a
third
reason
why
we
lack
control.
now,
we
had
no
--
neither
the
bank
nor
ourselves
had
the
power
to
release
those
records
without
the
consents
of
the
customers.
now,
let
me
say
at
this
point,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
are
not
invoking
swiss
secrecy
law
here
as
a
privilege.
we
are
well
aware
of
the
universal
anglo-saxon
doctrine
that
the
law
of
the
forum
will
determine
the
extent
of
the
privilege.
we
concede
readily
that
there
is
no
privilege
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
banking
secrecy.
and
we
are
in
no
wise
invoking
banking
secrecy
as
an
excuse
for
production
here.
now,
there's
a
wide
difference
between
us
on
that
point
because
the
solicitor
general
i'm
sure
will
argue
to
the
direct
contrary
and
he
will
use
that
as
a
premise
as
he
does
in
his
brief
from
which
a
series
of
conclusions
to
the
opposite
of
our
position
as
argued.
so
we
say
that
control
that
that
the
effect
of
swiss
secrecy
laws
here
was
to
establish
a
fact
of
lack
of
control
just
the
same
as
if
these
records
had
been
burned
or
hidden
otherwise
destroyed.
the
swiss
secrecy
laws
are
of
only
secondary
importance
in
this
case.
their
effect
is
remote.
they
created
a
condition
upon
these
records
which
made
them
physically
inaccessible
to
us.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
do.
another
word
mr.
justice
black
that
i
find
(inaudible)
use
of
power.
they
use
it
and
we
use
it
in
the
--
in
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
possession
and
power.
and
i'd
like
to
think
of
control
in
the
sense
of
the
power
to
produce,
the
ability
to
produce.
now,
going
back
to
your
--
the
court's
invitation
as
to
what
to
discuss,
we
find
that
we
deal
with
three
elements
here,
rule
37
which
is
the
sanction
rule
for
failure
to
comply
in
the
discovery
package
of
rules.
we
find
rule
41
which
is
the
rule
for
involuntary
dismissal
itself,
the
one
which
keeps
the
court
operating
orderly.
and
then
we
find
the
question
of
how
much
inherent
power
does
the
court
have.
now
interestingly
enough,
the
district
judge
went
on
all
three
points.
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
on
the
37
point
because
the
rule
37
(b)
on
which
he
relies
uses
the
words
"refuses
to
obey."
judge
laws
walked
the
word
refusal
into
the
word
failure.
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
accept
that.
the
court
of
appeals
found
a
simple
premise
to
their
way
of
thinking
in
rule
41
(b)
where
the
word
"failure"
appears
without
the
word
"willful"
or
without
any
connotation
of
willfulness.
the
court
of
appeals
also
invoked
the
inherent
power
of
the
court.
my
opponents
in
their
brief
seemed
to
have
abandoned
41.
they
gave
lip
service
to
41.
they
have
gone
back
and
attempted
to
support
judge
laws
on
refusal
on
this
stupid
definition
that
refusal
means
declination
and
declination
means
failure.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
i
would
think
that
actually
rule
41
is
the
dismissal
rule.
i
think
37
provide
the
ground
rules,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
for
when
to
impose
the
sanctions.
i
think
the
machinery
for
dismissal
is
in
41
(b).
now
--
then
all
the
parties
were
embracing
this
nebulous
undefined
inherent
power
because
willfulness
was
not
written
into
that
and
it
looked
like
this
was
something
that
was
most
simply
dealt
with.
now,
my
answer
is
twofold.
my
answer
is
that
whether
it'd
be
under
37,
whether
it'd
be
under
41
or
whether
it'd
be
under
inherent
power,
there
must
always
be
the
element
of
willfulness.
and
if
the
element
of
will
--
mr.
john
j.
wilson
sturzenegger.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
we
--
we
had
an
affiliation.
and
of
course
the
judges
found
prima
facie
that
we
had
control
over
the
sturzenegger
plan.
so
i
think
his
refusal
would
have
been
regarded
as
our
refusal.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it.
what
--
as
i
--
as
i
want
to
emphasize
while
we
do
not
abandon
our
attack
on
the
original
discovery
order,
our
main
predicate
here
today
is
that
the
seizure
order
by
the
swiss
federal
attorney
had
deprived
us
of
control.
now,
when
judge
laws
made
his
final
order
of
decision
of
dismissal,
he
found
conclusively
said
he
that
we
had
control
over
the
sturzenegger
papers
but
for
the
seizure
order
of
the
swiss
federal
attorney.
so
he
recognizes
the
same
predicate
upon
which
i
rely
here
today.
now,
i
was
saying
to
the
court
that
all
three
of
these
sources
of
power
are
dependent
upon
willfulness.
if
you
go
back
to
rule
41
(b)
where
this
--
it
says
"if
you
fail
to
obey
an
order,"
that's
the
order
under
which
cases
are
dismissed
for
one
of
prosecution.
but
certainly,
if
a
lawyer
and
his
client
knows
that
a
case
is
called
--
to
be
called
at
10
o'clock
tomorrow
morning.
on
the
way
to
the
court
as
tomorrow
morning,
they
have
to
do
an
automobile
accident
and
they
end
up
in
the
hospital
at
09:50.
and
the
judge
dismisses
the
case
because
they're
not
there
at
10.
it
had
passed
10
if
he's
told
that
he
will
vacate
the
dismissal.
the
absence
of
the
word
"willfulness"
from
the
word
"fail"
in
rule
41
(b)
is
not
going
to
change
the
inherent
moral
requirements
that
there
shall
be
some
kind
of
deliberate
action
or
its
equivalent
wanting
this
or
something
of
that
sort.
so
one
cannot
flee
from
37
to
41
to
inherit
power
and
get
away
from
the
inherent
proposition
here
that
there
must
be
willfulness.
now,
i
was
interested
in
an
opinion
that
was
rendered
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
case
in
which
they
made
a
quick
distinction
between
two
cases
which
i'm
going
to
discuss.
i'm
talking
about
the
hovey
against
elliott
case
decided
by
this
court
in
167
u.s.
and
hammond
packing
company
against
arkansas
in
212
u.s.
written
12
years
apart
by
the
late
chief
justice
white.
in
the
hovey
case,
one
of
the
parties
was
ordered
to
pay
money
over
to
the
other
party
which
was
in
a
semi-custodial
allegiance.
the
party
willfully
refused
to
pay
the
money
over
and
the
court
struck
his
answer
from
the
case.
and
this
court
held
that
that
wasn't
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
due
process.
this
court
said
that
that
was
punishment
and
punishment
may
not
be
imposed
so
as
to
deprive
a
litigant
of
his
day
in
court.
they
could
have
fined
elliott
in
hovey
against
elliott.
they
could
have
sent
him
to
jail
perhaps
but
they
could
not
strike
his
answer
because
that
--
that
deprives
him
in
his
day
in
court.
now
12
years
later
in
hammond
packing
company
against
arkansas,
the
question
came
up
of
an
arkansas
antitrust
statute
which
provided
in
section
8
for
discovery
and
which
provide
in
section
9
for
striking
the
answer
of
the
respondent
if
he
disobeyed
the
discovery.
hammond
packing
said
they
thought
the
law
was
invalid
and
they
refused
to
make
discovery
and
the
answer
was
struck
and
that
case
came
to
this
court.
and
that
case
came
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
hovey
against
elliott
saying
that
this
was
punishment.
this
court
said
that's
not
punishment.
this
time
we
deal
with
presumptions.
we
pass
upon
the
merits
in
effect
of
the
case.
we
do
not
strike
the
answer.
the
answer
was
not
struck
because
of
punishment.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
a
bona
fide
effort
to
comply
and
inability
to
comply
would
exonerate
the
defendant.
and
therefore
he
had
nothing
to
worry
about
it
and
the
sanctions
of
the
statute
could
not
be
imposed
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
but
if
he
deliberately
refused
then
what
the
law
does
is
to
raise
a
presumption
that
he
hasn't
got
a
good
defense,
a
presumption
of
the
untruthfulness
of
his
defense
and
in
striking
the
answer
under
those
conditions.
he's
had
his
day
in
court.
it's
the
same
as
sustaining
a
demurrer
to
an
--
to
a
declaration.
it's
the
same
as
sustaining
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
the
presumption
which
this
court
recognized
and
espoused
in
hammond
packing
company
against
arkansas
was
to
the
effect
that
a
man
who
willfully
disobeys
in
that
situation,
it
must
be
because
he
has
it
in
the
defense.
it's
something
like
flight
in
a
criminal
case.
it's
those
reasonable
inferences
that
can
be
drawn.
and
the
striking
of
the
answer
there
was
held
not
to
be
punishment
but
to
be
a
perfectly
valid
disposition
of
that
case
having
met
the
requirements
of
due
process
by
having
given
that
defendant
his
day
in
court.
now,
that's
our
situation.we
stand
before
the
bar
of
this
court
completely
innocent.
we
have
been
held
by
the
--
all
the
lower
courts
to
be
free
from
guilt
in
this
connection.
it
has
been
determined
that
we
were
in
good
faith,
that
we
were
incapable
of
producing
these
records
and
i
remind
the
court
what
i
said
a
few
moments
ago,
which
is
to
the
effect
that
when
the
judge
finally
dismissed
us
in
this
case,
he
did
so
because
he
said,
‚Äúi
might
as
well
bring
this
thing
to
an
end.‚Äù
you
can't
produce
these
records.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
i'm
coming
to
that.
that
case
by
the
way
is
cited
in
the
margin
in
national
union
against
arnold
with
this
court
which
i
wanted
to
discuss
next
before
i
sit
down.
i
want
to
save
a
few
moments
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
may
for
rebuttal.
the
case
is
peitzman
against
city
of
illmo,
141
f.2d
956.
it's
cited
by
this
court
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
--
in
the
national
union
case.
now,
the
--
the
court
in
that
case
reached
the
right
result
and
i'm
a
little
unfair
in
cutting
them
off
at
one
sentence.
but
i
do
want
to
read
the
one
sentence
to
--
to
demonstrate
my
point.
the
court
said
defendants
urge
that
the
order
in
fact
punishes
them
for
a
contempt
of
court
but
there's
a
distinction
between
striking
a
pleading
as
punishment
for
a
contempt
of
court
and
striking
it
for
violation
of
a
rule
of
procedure.
now,
that's
hardly
a
full
disposition
of
this
problem.
it
isn't
whether
it's
a
rule
of
the
procedure
which
did
it.
it's
not
whether
a
statute
authorized
the
striking.
it's
whether
the
circumstances
under
which
the
pleading
has
struck
is
such
that
the
party
has
had
his
due
process,
has
had
his
day
in
court
before
that
occurred.
now,
national
union
against
arnold
in
254
u.s.
written
by
mr.
justice
burton
as
i
remember
is
cited
by
our
opponents
for
the
proposition
of
the
inherent
power
of
the
court.
i
welcome
the
arrival
of
national
union
against
arnold.
i
think
it
speaks
more
eloquently
than
i
could
ever
begin
to
speak
in
support
of
the
reasons
why
dismissal
was
improper
in
this
case.
in
national
union
against
arnold,
a
defendant
had
a
verdict
against
him
and
a
judgment
against
him
for
several
hundred
thousand
dollars.
he
took
an
appeal
without
a
supersedeas.
and
during
the
appeal,
there
was
a
supplemental
proceeding
which
located
certain
assets.
he
was
ordered
to
turn
those
assets
over
to
the
winning
party.
he
refused
to
do
so.
the
appeal
was
struck.
and
the
question
came
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
hovey
against
elliot
that
that
was
the
punishment
and
the
punishment
was
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
now,
this
court
--
and
the
court
was
divided
upon
it.
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
and
per
curiam
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
on
the
main
point,
once
you've
got
over
the
main
point,
the
other
points
were
easy
as
they
point.
the
main
point
was,
is
the
right
of
an
appeal
part
of
the
due
process
package.and
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
it
wasn't.
so
you
brushed
aside
and
probably
brushed
aside
hovey
against
elliot
as
not
being
of
value
in
that
case
because
due
process
was
not
involved.
the
man
you
said
had
had
his
day
in
court
but
the
other
facts
of
the
case
are
equally
eloquent.
in
the
arnold
case,
there
was
willfulness
of
the
grossest
character.
in
our
case,
we
have
no
willfulness
at
all.
in
the
arnold
case,
not
only
were
you
satisfied
about
the
day
in
court
but
you
said,
‚Äúwe
do
not
think
that
this
is
the
imposition
of
punishment
for
a
criminal
contempt
but
only
a
coercive
measure
to
enforce
the
judgment.‚Äù
now,
take
those
words
and
try
to
apply
it
into
the
case
at
bar
and
not
one
of
them
thinks.
the
district
court
in
this
case
said
you
can't
comply.
therefore,
dismissal
was
not
for
coercive
purposes.
it
has
been
the
feeling
of
both
courts
that
we
--
below
that
we
couldn't
comply.
the
result
is
that
you
end
up
very
squarely
with
the
imposition
of
punishment
on
the
hovey
against
elliot.
and
that's
what
we
are
suffering
here.
we
haven't
had
our
day
in
court,
our
day
in
court
on
the
issue
over
whether
or
not
this
possession
of
control
is
not
the
question
i'm
arguing.
our
day
in
court
as
to
whether
there
was
a
lawful
vesting
in
this
case
of
this
property.
why
the
very
bottom
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
the
very
basis
for
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is
that
one
who
says
that
he
is
not
an
enemy
shall
have
his
day
in
court
to
litigate
the
validity
of
the
seizure.
there
was
no
administrative
hearing
in
this
case.
there
was
an
ex
parte
determination
that
this
vesting
should
take
place.
and
for
10
years
now
while
we've
been
accused
a
very
kind
of
effort
and
delay
which
i
deny
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
i
will
reply
to
my
very
worthy
opponents
for
whom
i
have
great
respect.
but
10
years,
every
effort
has
been
made
to
deprive
the
judiciary
of
an
opportunity
to
look
into
the
merits
of
this
seizure.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
may
i
dispose
of
a
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
of
the
implications
of
it.
the
petitioner
here
has
gotten
no
paper
from
the
sturzenegger
bank
after
the
seizure
order.
is
that
--
i
want
the
court
to
understand
that
beyond
any
question.
the
suggestion
that
the
petitioner
can
get
records
when
it
chooses
and
must
be
divided
--
i
don't
concede
it
but
at
least
the
point
must
be
divided
chronologically.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
through
the
waiver
system.
but
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
that
the
petitioner
can
always
get
the
documents
from
the
bank
that
it
wants
in
its
own
favor
but
can't
get
these
for
performance
of
this
discovery
order.
i
want
to
clear
up
immediately
the
proposition
that
we
have
gotten
no
document
except
by
the
waiver
procedure
since
the
swiss
federal
attorney
levied
his
confiscation
order
in
1950.
now
with
respect
to
documents
that
we've
gotten
earlier
than
that,
they
were
principally
documents
which
had
to
do
with
our
own
business
and
us
getting
them
from
the
bank
was
naturally
in
effect
a
waiver
of
consent
by
ourselves
of
the
swiss
secrecy.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
yes,
i
--
i
want
to
take
those
up
in
--
in
several
sequences.
i
wouldn't
want
to
miss
commenting
upon
that
for
the
world,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
you'll
let
me
come
to
it
in
my
regular
order,
i'll
promise
to
do
it
before
my
time
is
up.
my
greatly
respected
friend
here,
the
solicitor
general,
has
naturally
had
to
absorb
a
very
large
record
in
a
very
short
time.
and
i
mean
no
reflection
upon
him
when
i
criticize
some
of
his
allusions
to
the
record.
i
do
not
have
to
remind
the
court
there's
been
no
trial
here.
i
do
not
have
to
remind
the
court
that
there's
been
no
findings
of
enemy
taint.
but
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
i
disagree
with
many
of
the
factual
statements
that
the
solicitor
general
had
said.
and
believe
me
when
i
say
it.
i
suggest
nothing
but
pressure
time
it
is
(inaudible).he
speaks
about
the
communications
from
the
farben
to
the
financial
ministry
of
germany
as
evidence
in
this
case.
i
want
to
remind
the
court
that
the
reason
that's
in
this
record
is
that
when
sturzenegger
was
on
the
stand,
he
was
showing
one
of
those
documents
which
our
government
had
gotten
out
of
germany
after
the
fall
of
germany.
and
he
was
asked
if
he
could
identify
it
and
he
said
that
he
couldn't.
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
there
is
printed
in
this
record
literally
hundreds
of
pieces
of
materials
that
are
no
proof
of
anything
in
this
case,
that
have
not
been
offered
in
evidence,
that
have
not
even
been
identified
by
the
witness
who
was
shown
here.
and
i've
given
you
some
examples
of
it
at
the
bottom
of
page
7
in
foot
--
7
(a)
of
our
appendix
of
a
footnote
to
our
brief.
now
in
the
appendix
of
7
(a),
i
could
stand
here
for
hours
if
the
time
permitted
and
the
court
permitted
to
demonstrate
that
most
of
what
the
solicitor
general
has
offered
here
as
enemy
taint
has
not
been
established.
why
i
was
--
i
was
astounded
to
hear
him
say
that
our
client
was
german
up
to
1940.
there
isn't
a
word
of
truth
in
support
of
that
statement.
the
only
event
that
happened
in
1940
was
that
there
was
a
cancellation
of
a
contractual
relationship
between
farben
and
the
plaintiff
having
to
deal
with
reciprocal
rights.
farben
had
an
option
to
acquire
the
investments
of
chemie
in
exchange
for
which
chemie
was
guaranteed
by
chemie's
stockholders,
they
are
guaranteed
by
chemie,
the
same
dividend
rate
as
farben
was.
but
it
was
not
the
question
of
chemie
being
german
until
1940.
i
don't
deny
for
one
moment
that
the
inception
of
chemie
in
this
case
was
largely
german.
what
the
admitted
evidence
in
this
case
and
by
that
i
mean
the
deposition,
the
credible
depositions
that
are
not
in
dispute
show
the
evolution
of
the
swiss.
and
then
as
the
years
went
by,
they
began
to
throw
off
this
german
(inaudible).
and
long
before
1940,
this
corporation
seized
to
be
controlled
by
the
germans.
and
the
single
event
that
occurred
in
1940,
which
the
solicitor
general
points
to
as
a
date
when
they
seized
to
be
german
was
only
this
dividend
guarantee
contract
that
i
spoke
to
you
about.
about
the
books,
the
duplicate
set
of
books,
mr.
justice
brennan,
about
the
9000
missing
records
that
issue
is
yet
unresolved.
what
happened
was
this.
with
the
justice
department
took
the
position
that
the
plaintiff
had
failed
to
produce
these
proper
books
and
some
9000
documents.
they
didn't
move
to
dismiss
which
always
surprised
me.
i
never
knew
--
i
wonder
why
they
didn't
at
that
time
move
to
strike
this
down
for
some
kind
of
a
simple
act.
they
moved
for
a
second
discovery
order
against
interhandel,
chemie,
the
petitioner.
and
at
that
time,
we
were
fighting
over
whether
this
was
a
duplicate
set
of
books
and
we
were
fighting
over
whether
there
were
9000
documents
missing
when
judge
laws
issued
his
decision
of
february
19,
1923.
at
that
point,
i
moved
that
we
stay
everything
until
we
get
through
this
main
battle.
now,
we've
never
gotten
back
on
that
fight.
we
don't
concede
there's
any
duplicate
set
of
books
here.
with
regard
to
the
9000
records
that
we
--
that
is
claimed
that
we
withheld,
we
went
back
and
looked
again.
mind
you,
if
the
court
please,
we
produced
41,000
documents,
70,000
microfilms
were
taken
of
our
client's
records.
isn't
there
a
margin
for
error
there
that's
possible
that
it
won't
be
denominated
bad
faith
of
crookedness?
we
went
back
when
we
said
that
we
had
given
them
9000
documents
and
we
began
to
dig.
and
what
did
we
find?
we
found
that
other
9000,
some
5000
were
second
and
third
and
fourth
carbons
of
documents
of
which
they've
gotten
the
first
carbon
already.
and
we
were
in
the
middle
of
explaining
the
absence
of
the
other
4000,
some
of
which
we
were
producing
piecemeal
when
that
proceeding
was
stopped.
i
submit
the
solicitor
general
has
no
right
to
mention
that
matter
to
this
court.
that
matter
is
in
the
lap
of
the
district
court
for
decision.
now,
if
i
have
several
moments
later
--
left,
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
observations
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
when
he
posed
two
complementary
observations.
one
was
with
respect
to
the
national
being
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
its
nation.
that's
--
that
problem
is
--
that
question
is
in
this
case.
i
wouldn't
be
fair
with
the
court
if
i
didn't
face
up
to
its
existence.
what
we
have
on
the
one
hand,
no
charge
that
the
government
of
switzerland
has
acted
in
bad
faith.
and
we
have
on
the
other
hand,
no
proof
that
the
petitioner
has
acted
in
bad
faith.
and
we've
searched
the
authorities
and
i'm
sure
that
our
respondent's
have
searched
the
authorities.
and
there
isn't
a
case
that
we
found
in
the
books
wherein
peacetime.
in
the
course
of
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence,
a
national
in
a
transaction
of
this
sort
would
be
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
its
nation.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
the
victoria,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
very
simple
case
in
which
there
was
not
even
a
discovery
order.
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
kronprinzessin
victoria,
one
of
the
british
prize
cases,
in
that
case,
the
claimant
to
the
cargo
has
leave
to
produce
and
be
given
time
and
he
was
given
time
and
he
didn't
produce.
and
the
case
was
decided
on
the
merits
because
of
the
absence
of
the
evidence.
the
case
is
simply
easily
distinguishable
--
mr.
john
j.
wilson
yes,
sir.
there's
no
doubt
about
it
and
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
glad,
your
honor,
brought
up
the
british
cases.
i
hope
the
court
will
bear
with
me
a
moment
or
two
that
i
may
discuss
it.
i
think
that
one
of
the
british
cases
is
extremely
troublesome
to
us.
it
is
not
the
kronprinzessin
victoria,
it's
the
antilla.
the
antilla
--
and
i
think
we
misstated
our
position
in
our
brief
on
the
antilla.
i
think
the
antilla
was
decided
not
on
the
merits
because
we
argued
in
our
brief
that
all
the
british
prize
cases
despite
the
fact
that
the
claim
was
struck.
the
court
went
on
and
decided
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
in
every
one
of
the
british
prize
cases
including
the
kronprinzessin
victoria,
including
the
antilla,
including
the
stjernblad,
including
the
margareta
and
all
of
those
cases,
they
did
not
have
the
factual
problem
--
questions
they
have
here.
the
swede
and
every
one
of
those
cases
had
possession
of
his
own
records.
he
declined
to
produce
them
because
he
was
afraid
of
the
swedish
war
trade
law.
that
was
the
imposition
of
the
foreign
privilege.
that
is
now
the
problem
here.we
have
lost
possession.
also
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
want
to
remind
you
that
the
british
cases
on
prize
were
not
troubled
with
due
process
one
bit.
and
yesterday
morning,
i
was
troubled
about
the
antilla.
i
thought
we
had
overstated
our
position
in
our
brief
in
the
antilla
and
we
discovered
strangely
enough,
another
citation
to
antilla
that
was
not
called
to
the
court's
attention
by
either
side.
the
antilla
went
to
the

went
to
the
--
to
the
privy
council
and
it
will
be
found
in
1919
a.c.
at
250.
mr.
john
j.
wilson
1919,
appeals
cases
250,
october
15,
1918
and
that
case,
clarified
somebody's
thinking
on
my
part
as
to
whether
the
antilla
was
decided
on
the
merits
or
not.
i
don't
concede
any
defeat,
if
the
court
please,
as
a
result
of
this
discovery
because
i
still
say
the
british
prize
cases
do
not
hurt
us
for
several
reasons.
what
i
do
want
to
remind
the
court
when
you
do
read
the
appeals
case
in
1919,
you
will
find
the
privy
council
said
there
was
first
of
all
the
step
taken
by
the
court
of
punitively
striking
out
the
claim.
now,
if
anybody
says
in
this
case
that
we
maybe
punitively
struck
out
then
hovey
against
elliot
raises
its
hand
in
opposition
to
that.
and
we
are
suffering
the
loss
of
due
process.
thank
you.
