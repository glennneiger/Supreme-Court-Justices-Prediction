justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
did
those
--
what
did
those
records
consist?
two
hundred
thousand
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
200,000
individual
slips,
is
that
it
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
estimate
of
what
the
number
of
the
documents
would
be
that
are
relevant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
was
the
release
--
were
these
200,000
released
with
some
consent
of
the
swiss
authorities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
decision
what
should
be
released
was
made
by
the
swiss
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
to
say
a
customer
would
waive
and
consent
and
then
his
records
would
be
released
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
are
there
large
numbers
of
customers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
can
you
say
if
how
many
customers
are
involved
in
the
record
released?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
mr.
wilson
that
the
government
had
given
you
a
list
of
124
names
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whose
records
they
thought
were
desired?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
you
said
that
you
produce
the
records
to
some
125
or
more
people.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
many
of
that
125
are
the
names
of
persons
on
the
government's
list
of
124?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
can
you
say
how
many
of
the
government's
list
of
124
you
did
not
produce?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
these
findings,
mr.
solicitor,
both
the
petitioner
and
the
swiss
bank?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
so
i
understand
that
the
secrecy
of
the
swiss
law
was
availed
of
the
high
facts
from
whom,
the
swiss
government
or
the
german
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
1928?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
are
they
--
who
are
the
â€œthey"?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
petitioner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
solicitor,
you
keep
suggesting
that
basically
it
is
the
courts
who
are
interested
in
both
sides
having
a
fair
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
get
an
implication
from
that
that
the
government
feels
that
even
though
we
could
establish
its
defense
without
these
figures
and
nevertheless
that
because
of
that
point
of
view,
this
was
properly
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you've
said
so
many
things
that
i
haven't
cited
--
of
course
to
read
this
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
said
so
many
things
to
indicate
that
on
the
phase
of
it,
there's
ample
proof
here
that
this
taint
existed
which
i
understood
you
to
mean
must
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government
could
establish
its
defense
without
difficulty
just
on
the
record
as
it
stand.
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
are
saying
that
the
government's
defense
is
for
possibly
prejudiced
by
inability
to
gather
these
records,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
you
say,
mr.
solicitor
that
--
i
don't
know
whether
you
said
this
has
already
been
done
or
that
you
apprehended
that
it
could
be
done
that
they
can
manage
to
produce
the
papers
that
support
their
claims
but
deny
their
ability
to
produce
the
papers
that
would
support
your
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
that
supports
their
claims.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
you
ever
been
told
why
it
is
the
secrecy
laws
have
not
prevented
their
production
of
the
papers
that
support
their
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
you
say
no
paper.
i
thought
you
told
us
there
were
200,000
pieces
of
paper
that's
given.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
books
that
seemed
to
have
been
printed
after
the
entry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
