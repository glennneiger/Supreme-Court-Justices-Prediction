where
is
the
production
order
printed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
did
the
court
make
any
findings
on
that
theory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
entered
to
its
--
its
determination
that
the
--
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
as
--
as
i
read
its
opinion
that
was
on
--
not
on
the
theory
of
any
special
relationship.
it
was
on
the
theory
that
there
was
no
excuse
in
the
courts
of
this
country
to
plea
the
laws
of
a
foreign
country
for
inability
to
produce
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
which
is
wholly
a
proposition,
wholly
unrelated
to
the
particular
factual
setting
which
you
say
distinguishes
the
case
from
the
case
justice
frankfurter
put
to
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
supposing
the
records
had
been
taken
by
the
british
and
lodge
it
to
the
bank
of
england
for
some
reason
and
then
these
people
go
to
the
bank
and
say,
“we'd
like
to
have
this.
we
need
them."
and
the
bank
of
england
says,
“no,
we
want
them
for
our
security
grounds
and
whatnot.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
would
have
been
an
excuse?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
--
then
your
position
seems
to
me
again
to
come
back
to
the
proposition
is
because
of
the
special
facts
that
surround
the
relationship
of
these
people
to
the
swiss
bank
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
you
have
to
stand
on
that
if
there
are
no
findings
made
to
that
effect.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
believe
it
even
goes
far
than
that
mr.
justice
harlan
in
that
--
if
they
were
an
innocent
swiss
doing
business
under
those
laws
and
if
they
come
into
the
courts
of
this
country
and
say,
“we
ran
our
business
through
the
swiss
bank
and
we
can't
get
these
records
because
of
the
swiss
secrecy
laws
and
so
forth,”
the
court
said
that
the
fact
that
there
are
such
laws
in
switzerland
as
choosing
between
whether
the
burden
of
that
should
fall
upon
their
national
or
our
national
was
that
it
should
fall
upon
their
nation
even
if
that
person
did
not
anticipate
in
advance
and
tried
to
gain
any
special
benefits
but
just
happened
to
be
in
switzerland,
a
national
of
it
(inaudible)
and
was
transacting
some
business
with
the
bank
but
he
would
still
be
unable
to
produce
those
because
of
the
laws
of
his
country
restricting
them
which
our
country
doesn't
recognize
at
all
and
he
would
be
governed
by
the
laws
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
to
that
very
reason.
i
suppose
the
district
court
refrained
from
making
any
findings
on
any
of
these
things
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
this
reference
to
mr.
hughes,
the
master,
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
what
should
be
done
about
the
failure
to
produce.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
there
was
a
hearing
on
good
faith
and
to
guide
the
court
in
what
sanctions
if
any
should
be
applied
or
so
forth.
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
protection?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
a
pretty
broad
finding
here,
number
8,
no
collusion
anytime
that
has
shown
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
swiss
government
that
goes
beyond
the
narrow
--
the
narrow
interpretation
of
some
of
the
other
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
argument
know
the
extent
of
saying
that
the
representations
to
the
court
that
they
cannot
comply
because
of
the
situations
which
it
is
not
a
good
faith
representation
but
simply
a
cover
up
or
saying
that
they
won't
--
they
don't
want
to
comply
in
the
respects
that
they
have
not
finished
up?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
go
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
on
that?
how
could
that
statement
be
made
at
this
stage
when
as
i
understand
it
neither
the
government
nor
the
court
has
looked
at
the
records
that
have
already
been
produced?
how
--
for
all
that
we
know,
it
may
be
that
if
you
went
through
those
records,
you
would
find
adequate
proof
short
of
getting
anything
more
to
establish
your
case.
