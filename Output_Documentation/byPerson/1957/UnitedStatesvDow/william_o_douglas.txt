justice
william
o.
douglas
would
--
would
the
case
be
mine
as
is
yours?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
taking.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
there
was
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there's
acceptance
in
the
assignment
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
assignments
by
operation
of
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
you
think
this
would
be
within
that
exception?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
was
wondering
if
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
was
wondering
if
it's
a
practical
matter
with
the
government's
point
of
view
to
be
any
difficulty
that
the
predecessor
that's
entitled
and
dow
will
both
join.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
shannon
is
a
little
different
because
there,
there
was
--
there
was
this
--
not
a
conveyance
of
real
estate,
not
--
not
a
change
of
title
but
an
assignment
of
the
claim
separate
to
the
parties
who
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
gather
that
your
--
your
position
then
is
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
interest
prior
to
the
date
of
it's
purchase?
justice
william
o.
douglas
just
a
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
under
our
miller
case,
the
increment
of
value,
the
reason
that
the
government's
present
area
was
not
--
went
to
the
valuation
(inaudible).
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
just
say
under
our
old
miller
case,
i
think
where
the
opinion
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
written
by
justice
roberts.
justice
william
o.
douglas
an
increment
of
value
is
a
result
of
the
government's
activity
here,
would
not
enter
into
the
valuation
of
the
property.
i
wrote
miller
case
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
certainly
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
certainly
one
of
them
is
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
on
the
--
on
this
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
the
issue
of
valuation,
you
don't
need
to
worry
here
about
the
difference
between
50,000
and
150.
