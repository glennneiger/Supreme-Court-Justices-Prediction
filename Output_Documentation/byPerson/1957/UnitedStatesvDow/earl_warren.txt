chief

warren
and
in
this

i
understand
the

the
condemnation

was
filed
one
day
and
approximately
the
next
day,
the
contact
into

time.

yes.
chief

well,
may
i
--
may
i
advert
to
the
case
that
we
had
before
lunch
just
for
a
moment.
i
--
i
see
mr.
morgan
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
morgan,
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
the
--
that
the
court
is
grateful
to
you
for
having
taken
the
assignment
of
this
case,
of
this
panelist
man
of
having
carried
it
through
to
the
supreme
court.
we
--
we're
always
grateful
to
lawyers
who
do
that
and
we
feel
comforted
by
the
fact
that
--
that
lawyers
will
see
to
it
that
--
that
panelist
people
do
have
a
defense
even
to
--
up
to
this
court.
so
we
appreciate
it,
i
would
have
said
it
to
you
before
the
recess
but
slipped
my
mind,
and
of
course,
we
appreciate
the
fervor
of
the
defense
of
the
state
that
was
given
by
your
opponents,
i
don't
see
them
in
court;
i
hope
you'll
convey
that
news
to
them.
chief
justice
earl
