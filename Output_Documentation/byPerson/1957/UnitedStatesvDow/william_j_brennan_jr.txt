justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
basically
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
simmer,
may
i
test
that
this
way?
are
you
telling
it's
something
like
this?
that
the
1943,
this
property
had
a
value
of
$50,000.
in
the
1946
or
1947,
whatever
that
year
is,
the
title
was
finally
perfected.
it
had
a
value
of
$150,000.
mr.
dow
gets
only
$50,000
and
whoever
was
the
intervening
owner
gets
what,
something
for
the
possession,
the
value
of
the
possession
and
the
intervening
period.
mr.
dow
gets
50,000,
i
take
it.
does,
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
there's
something
plus
for
the
value
or
the
possession
taken
in
the
intervening
period,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
satisfies
the
just
compensation
requirement
even
though
the
property
in
fact
when
mr.
dow
gets
title
is
150,000.
and
when
the
government
takes
the
title
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
that
is
the
result,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
that
fully
satisfies
the
fifth
amendment
requirement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
well
as
the
first
pay
provisions
of
the
state
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
my
other
question.
the
intervening
--
the
vendor,
what
his
possession
for
whatever
that
period
is
that
the
government's
absolute
promise
before
the
government
acquires
title.
now,
how
is
that
measured?
also
in
--
as
a
reflection
of
the
$50,000-value
at
the
time
that
possession
was
taken?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
again,
no,
i'm
assuming
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
hypothetically
that
that
value
is
$50,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
that's
measured
an
interest,
what's
--
what's
the
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
amount,
does
that
fix
the
rate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
by
the
rates,
4%
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can't
hear
you,
mr.
morton.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
morton,
what
--
what
would
happen
in
the
fact
situation
i
put
to
mr.
simmer.
50,000
in
1943
and
150,000
at
the
time
the
title
was
acquired.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
your
theory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
his
answer
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
may
have
given
his,
is
that
also
your
answer?
