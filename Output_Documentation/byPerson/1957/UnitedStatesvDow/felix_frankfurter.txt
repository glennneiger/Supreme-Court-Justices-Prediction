justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
constitutional
provisions
to
which
you
refer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
i
--
did
i
hear
you
indicate
or
state
that
whether
the
constitutional
provision
such
as
you've
indicated
that
it
is
that
provision
which
gives
the
power
of
eminent
domain
and
without
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
state
wouldn't
have
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
that
makes
a
difference
as
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
consequences
of
the
exercise
to
that
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
a
provision
either
in
a
contract
or
a
statute
which
fixes
the
time
of
payment
necessarily
mean
that
an
--
that
an
obligation
doesn't
arise
before
that?
i
don't
see
why
logically
that
follows.
by
what
principles
of
policy
do
that
follows?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
trespass
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
why
--
what
--
what
kind
of
question
is
involved
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
ever
you
stated.
i
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
self-evident
proposition
that
that
should
be
so.
i
wonder
if
it
is
in
relation
to
some
questions
that
are
not
relevant
to
this
case.
why
should
it
be
a
trespass?
because
the
statutes
says
you
must
pay
when
you
take
and
you
don't
pay
--
suppose
you
don't
pay
and
suppose
the
--
the
grantor
--
well,
the
state
of
new
york
or
wherever
it
is,
wyoming
or
whatnot,
is
a
good
--
good
debtor
and
not
--
doesn't
bother
about
it
until
you
actually
pay
as
trespass?
is
that
what
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
think
that's
a
fiscal
arrangement,
this
doesn't
necessarily
determine
what
the
rights
that
you
speak
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can
understand
that.
that's
a
limitation
upon
those
who
exercises
sovereign
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
remember
that
time
they're
acting
out
of
irony
throughout.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
case
of
united
states,
what
is
the
usual
procedure
about
putting
up
the
money
or
getting
the
money
into
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
determines
when
you
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
under
general
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
of
them
is
i
think
indicated
by
a
remark,
sometime
this
fuzzy
feel
whether
there
was
a
taking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
i
thought
in
mind
because
there's
not
any
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
was
the
declaration
--
why
is
--
is
the
declaration
of
taking
postponed,
not
merely
--
not
in
this
particular
case,
but
generally,
why
--
what
is
the
point
of
it?
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
maneuvering
has
left
to
the
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
between
physical
taking
and
a
declaration
of
taking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
have
to
--
i
didn't
mean
it
to
have
any.
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
could
the
owner
in
this
case
have
--
by
any
means
come
into
court
and
said,
“the
government
has
commenced
condemnation
proceedings
and
i'm
hard
up
and
i
need
the
money?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
not
--
not
after
but
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
dickinson
now
--
i
asked
because
i
don't
know.
that
was
as
--
you
and
i
know
a
special
case,
but
is
--
is
--
what
was
decided
in
dickinson
now
applied
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
to
a
situation
like
this
so
that
the
statute
doesn't
run
until
the
declaration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
here,
it
was
stabilized?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
said
a
minute
ago
that
you
couldn't
tell
what
--
what
the
--
what
the
boundaries
and
dimensions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
in
this
case,
the
statute
would
run
as
of
1943?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
know.
but
i'm
--
i'm
just
--
i'd
like
to
see
what
the
nature
of
the
problem
is
and
what's
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suggest,
justice
whittaker's
question
of
what
the
claim
is,
is
pertinent
because
if
you've
taken
1943
and
then
dismissed
four
months
later,
i
don't
think
that
that
which
was
a
taking
in
the
beginning
has
become
a
trespass
while
you
couldn't
sue
for
tresspass
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
it
still
was
a
lawful,
an
exercise
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
but
by
choice
of
the
government,
it
was
curtailed
into
a
--
use
--
use
of
four
months
or
whatever
used,
isn't
that
right,
mr.
morton?
wouldn't
that
be
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
merely
suggest,
just
as
the
dickinson
raised
a
statute
of
limitations
problem
that
we
didn't
have
before.
you
now
present
us
with
eminent
domain
problem
that
so
far
as
i
know,
we
haven't
had
before.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
surprised
a
little
bit
by
your
answer
that
they
could
mostly
surely
have
filed
a
claim
10
days
later
as
under
the
tucker
act
because
if
that's
so,
then
the
difference
between
this
power
under
the
tucker
act
and
the
first-pay
provisions
of
the
states
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
big
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
trying
to
prove
inconsistency
on
your
part,
i
was
trying
to
get
some
more
or
light
into
my
documents
because
this
has
always
been
a
troublesome
theory,
problems
as
to
domain
problems.
but
if
you
tell
me
that
under
the
constitutional
provision
of
the
state,
what
is
determinative
if
it
is
that
the
constitution
of
texas,
if
you
will,
and
as
to
--
requires
payment.
and
you
tell
me
that
under
the
tucker
act,
although
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
just
as
soon
as
you
take
something,
a
man
may
move
in
and
get
the
money
from
uncle
sam.
i
had
supposed
the
contrary,
i
suppose
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
--
you
can
take
without
paying,
which
i
understand
to
be
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
that
makes
the
--
that
makes
the
practical
difference
between
the
rights
of
an
owner
of
land
under
the
first
pay
statute
of
constitutional
provision
and
the
right
of
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
--
to
answer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
value
of
the
property
may
vary
in
the
intervening
period
and
sometimes
it
goes
up
and
sometimes
it
goes
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
simmer,
could
you
tell
me
whether
the
cases
have
arisen
in
which
a
state
sought
to
tax
the
land
that
was
taken
between
the
physical
--
possession
by
the
united
states
in
what
you
just
tell
was
the
vesting
of
the
title?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
have
known
that
case,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you,
mr.
simmer,
the
more
i
hear
of
this
case,
the
more
interestingly
confusing
it
becomes.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
although
the
vital
date,
what
you
call
--
when
the
government
is
--
could
no
longer
change
its
position
it's
committed.
you
draw
on
dickinson
which
has
a
little
different
problem,
the
statute
of
limitation.
but
you
say
46
is
a
fixed
day
but
you
relate
back
as
to
the
value,
although
the
taking
in
the
constitutional
sene
is
1946,
you
go
back
to
1943
for
the
amount
of
compensation
to
be
paid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
in
all
these
should
be
bothered?
i
don't
understand
anything.
i
thought
it
really
had
to
do
with
what
--
at
what
date
the
amount
which
uncle
sam
has
to
pay
to
be
fixed
but
apparently,
it
isn't
that
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
simmer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
revert
to
my
question.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
it
maybe
an
equitable
rule.
that
when
you
have
--
when
you
have
to
ascertain
what
the
value
is
which
the
government
has
taken,
there
is
a
matter
of
damages,
you
go
back
to
the
earlier
date.
as
i
understand
your
position,
it's
a
constitutional
provision,
a
proper
construction
of
the
fifth
amendment
about
just
compensation,
is
that
right?
this
is
a
construction
of
the
constitutional
provision
and
you
say
there's
no
taking
within
the
fifth
amendment
comparable
to
the
first
pay
provisions
of
the
state
laws
until
the
government
is
irrevocably
committed.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
understand
then
why
it
shouldn't
be
also
--
why
it
should
be
a
constitutional
rule
but
you
jump
back
then
to
whatever
the
years
are,
six
months,
two
years,
three
years
or
four
years
in
order
to
ascertain
the
then
value
of
the
property
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ascertaining
the
money
damages.
it's
complicated
business
as
we
all
know
and
you
may
resort
to
all
sorts
of
things.
but
as
a
constitutional
doctrine
of
just
compensation,
i
shouldn't
think
that
would
be
the
rule
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
interrupt
me
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
taken
the
considerations
of
expediency
and
difficulties
and
they're
on
--
well,
that's
the
fix
on
that,
i
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
you
could
tell
me,
that
is
settled,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
vow
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
show
--
just
shows
how
mere
logic
isn't
deciding
this
problem,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
