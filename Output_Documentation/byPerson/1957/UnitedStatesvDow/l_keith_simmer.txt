mr.
l.
keith
simmer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
enlightened
and
entertained
by
the
questions
asked
by
the
court
of
my
opponent
in
this
case
and
i
hope
they'll
do
me
the
honor
of
continuing
then
to
answer
a
few
of
the
points
raised
and
dealt
with
in
the
opening
argument.
i
would
say
first
of
all
about
the
date
of
valuation
and
the
thought
of
the
future
of
this
case
as
contradicting
the
miller
case,
the
court
took
care
as
all
of
the
so-called
"first-pay
courts‚Äù
do
to
provide
that
the
date
of
valuation
would
for
equitable
reasons
remain
the
date
when
physical
possession
was
taken.
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
decision
below
which
would
warrant
the
statement
of
counsel
that
there
can
be
manipulations
following
the
date
of
taking
possession
since
there
is
no
part
of
that
decision
which
lends
any
comfort
to
any
manipulation
of
valuation
was.
the
court
specifically
avoided
that
and
prevented
it
happening
in
its
opinion.
and
i
might
say
that
nichols
on
eminent
domain,
section
3
plus
the
section
8.5
(2).
that's
3
nichols
page
23,
states
clearly
that
the
states
adopting
the
first-pay
rule
also
go
to
the
date
of
possession
as
the
date
of
valuation
and
they
--
that
particular
horror
is
one
which
is
not
really
in
the
case
topside
or
bottom.
the
court
also
asked
why
the
delay
--
i
also
must
plead
ignorance
of
that.
i
came
into
this
case,
and
in
fact,
i
started
practicing
law
some
years
after
this
land
was
taken
possession
of
by
the
government.
but
i
am
sure
that
the
reasons
were
valid
ones
and
i
think
the
one
that
my
opponent
stated
has
been
given
voice
in
a
number
of
instances
and
that
is
that
the
government
counsel
in
a
wartime
emergency
is
somewhat
harassed
and
undecided
on
proper
steps
to
take
with
reference
to
property,
all
of
a
sudden,
needed
for
government
uses.
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
so
called
first
pay
and
it's
comparison
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and
i
would
say
first
that
the
distinction
attempted
to
be
drawn
by
my
colleague
for
the
government
that
there
is
some
miraculous
difference
between
the
constitutions
of
our
several
states
and
the
fifth
amendment
provision
that
property
taken
for
public
use
shall
not
be
taken
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
i
think
that
actually,
the
constitution
of
texas
and
of
a
good
many
of
our
states,
certainly,
most
of
the
western
ones
are
patterned
almost
verbatim
on
the
federal
constitution
and
there
is
no
substantial
difference
in
language
between
the
like
provision
of
the
texas
constitution
and
of
the
federal
constitution.
i
might
say
also
that
the
consequences
of
first
pay
before
taking
title
is
a
matter
that
has
been
passed
upon
by
this
court.
it
is
some
years
ago
but
mr.
justice
harlan
in
cherokee
nation
versus
the
southern
kansas
railroad
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
dealt
with
that
exact
point
and
there,
the
court
adverted
to
the
constitution
of
a
state
and
said
that
the
federal
constitution
was
exactly
the
same
and
that
if
provided
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
constitution,
there
is
no
taking
until
payment
is
made.
now,
that
was
made
in
answer
to
an
argument
presented
on
behalf
of
the
cherokee
nation
that
--
well
what
would
happen
here,
you're
condemning
line
for
a
railroad
across
our
lands.
what
would
happen
here
if
there's
not
enough
money
in
the
registry
of
the
court
to
pay
the
amount
that
the
jury
feels
we're
entitled
to?
and
the
court
then
answered
that
question
by
saying
and
announcing
this
--
announcing
this
rule
that
title
does
not
pass
in
condemnation
proceedings
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
until
provision
is
made
for
payment.
now,
that,
i
submit
to
the
honorable
court,
is
precisely
the
argument
and
the
ruling
of
the
first-pay
states
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
and
certainly
texas
is
one
of
them.
and
on
that
point,
there
--
i
just
beg
to
differ
with
counsel.
i
think
i
understand
that
in
the
harassment
of,
other
than
government
counsel,
occasionally
acitation
maybe
made
an
error
and
if
so,
i
certainly
regret
it.
however,
the
court
will
--
i'm
sure,
be
able
to
read
those
cases
and
to
see
that
they
are
cases
where
a
possession
was
taken
before
the
date
of
the
transfer
to
the
subsequent
vendee.
and
that
in
those
cases,
the
title
obtained
by
the
vendee
carried
with
it
the
title
to
the
property
then
subject
to
condemnation
and
the
right
to
the
award.
that's
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
thank
you,
your
honor.
and
i
should
have
had
it
in
my
brief,
united
states
versus
alabama.
chief
justice
hughes
decided
a
number
of
years
ago
and
i
will
give
you
that
citation.
313
united
states,
page
274.
in
that
case,
the
state
of
alabama
had
a
tax
rule
or
provision
of
tax
law.
i
believe
it
was
just
under
the
statute
or
by
liens
for
taxes
would
accrue
as
of
a
day
certain.
i
believe
it
was
the
15th
of
october
of
each
year.
however,
the
actual
amount
of
taxes
which
would
be
paid
by
the
owner
of
the
land
would
not
become
known
or
in
fact
would
not
be
fixed
until
a
number
of
months
later.
after
the
date
of
october
15th
but
before
the
date
when
the
amount
became
ascertained
and
known,
the
government
acquired
title
to
premises
involving
that
suit.
the
government
then
urged
that
since
their
title
had
vested
before
the
date
when
the
amount
became
ascertained,
no
tax
is
paid,
the
exemption
of
federal
land
should
apply.
and
this
honorable
court
held,
speaking
through
chief
justice
hughes
that
while
there
was
an
immunity
from
suits,
so
that
alabama
possibly
could
not
levy
or
could
not
take
the
lands
away
or
sell
them
at
a
--
at
a
tax
sale
against
the
government,
that's
still
the
--
the
difference
between
an
immunity
and
a
right
existed,
and
that
is
very
important
right
here
in
this
case
too.
the
immunity
is
one
thing,
the
right
is
another.
and
i
wish
to
say
that
it
can
be
applied
exactly
in
this
case.
the
governmental
power
under
its
war
powers
act
is
one
facet,
it
is
one
fact.
but
it
is
merely
a
fact
from
that
exercise
of
a
power,
the
government
accrues
no
rights.
and
--
and
we
submit,
that
the
same
line
of
reasoning
would
sustain
the
opinion
and
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
this
case,
if
i
have
answered
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
i
think
the
question
was
asked
something
about
the
--
whether
the
government
would
pay
more
or
would
pay
less
as
a
result
of
the
decision
below.
and
that
is
certainly
a
fair
question
in
condemnation
suit
because
after
all,
we,
although
litigating
with
the
government
here.
we
are
members
of
the
body
politic
and
we
have
an
interest
which
goes
to
the
other
side.
also,
that
the
government
shall
not
pay
too
much
for
land
as
well
that
they
shall
pay
what
is
eventually
just
compensation.
and
my
answer
to
the
question
which
the
court
put
to
counsel
is
that
the
court
--
that
the
government
will
pay
exactly
the
same,
exactly
the
same
under
either
view.
now,
it
is
merely
an
accident
as
pointed
out
by
counsel
and
as
we
certainly
point
out
in
our
brief.
it
is
merely
an
accident
that
an
overzealous
government
attorney
has
raised
the
question
of
limitations
as
against
the
vendors
in
lower
courts.
that
--
that
is
something
that
i'm
sure
that
counsel
has
disassociated
himself
from
and
i
personally
do
not
blame
him.
and
we
think
that
it
had
--
it
should
not
--
really,
the
case
here
should
not
turn
on
anything
like
that.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir
your
honor
that
is
what
we
said.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
then
landowner
would
get
no
more
and
no
less
than
just
compensation.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
in
this
case.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
but
what
do
you
mean
in
that
context
when
you
say
taking?
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
well
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
the
magic
in
the
word
"taking"
is
one
--
something
that
is
alluded
to
on
the
other
side.
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
when
did
the
claim
for
the
taking
of
title
arise
for
which
just
compensation
is
due?
but
the
answer
your
question
about
interest,
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief
which
say
that
where
there
--
where
land
is
conveyed
between
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
condemnation
proceedings
and
the
completion
of
those
same
proceedings,
that
the
two
people;
the
vendor
and
the
vendee
are
equal
--
are
entitled
to
that
amount
which
put
together
and
added
together,
will
in
itself
equal
just
compensation
including
the
delay
or
the
use
and
possession
ahead
of
the
taking,
whichever
it
is.
as
i
understand
these
cases,
your
honor,
your
--
the
court
has
never
bound
itself
strictly
to
the
idea
that
interest
is
the
only
possible
compensation
for
delay
in
payment,
that
there
--
that
that
is
one
--
merely
one.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
well,
your
honor,
the
--
if
--
i
think
that
the
question
put
by
judge
whittaker
during
the
opening
argument
is
itself
the
answer.
and
that
is,
supposing
the
government
had
abandoned,
then
the
original
landowner
and
the
later
landowner
would
be
entitled
to
restoration
damages,
rights
for
accruing
under
--
for
use
and
possession.
now,
it
may
be
that
interest
from
that
date
is
a
good
measure.
if
it
is,
then
interest
to
the
date
of
a
declaration
of
taking
from
the
time
of
taking
possession
until
the
time
of
filing
a
declaration
of
taking
would
be
just
compensation
for
the
vendors
of
my
client,
respondent,
c.m.dow.
that
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
not
under
texas
law
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
not
under
texas
law,
regardless
of
the
anti-assignment
act,
the
law
of
texas
provides
that
a
claim
for
damages
which
is
exactly
what
that
would
be
if
the
government
did
abandon
ahead
of
the
time
when
--
that
dow
took
title
to
the
land.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
for
the
use
and
possession
where
the
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
oh,
agreed,
i
certainly
agreed
--
certainly
agree
with
that.
there
is
a
right
to
restoration
damages,
and
that
again
is
held
as
--
as
far
--
as
far
back
as
cherokee
nation
versus
southern
kansas
railway.
certainly,
there's
a
right
to
restoration
damage,
there's
a
right
to
the
--
to
damages
for
the
use
and
possession
that
the
government
makes
if
they
never
go
on
and
take
title
to
the
land,
if
they
never.
there
was
--
there
has
always
been
a
duty
to
pay
just
compensation
for
--
where
premises
are
taken
for
a
short
period
or
for
a
long
period,
there's
no
change
in
that.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir,
it
would
and
it
would
be
something
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
right.
yes,
sir.
and
it
--
and
it
would
be
something
that
under
texas
law
could
not
come
under
his
deed.
and
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief
for
that
proposition
that
a
right
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
it
would
not
be
pass
by
a
deed.
it
would
be
against
texas
law
for
such
a
right
to
pass
under
a
deed.
and
i
might
say
in
this
connection,
the
question
raised
under
the
shannon
case
by
--
i
believed
judge
--
justice
black,
excuse
me,
was
whether
this
was
a
different
sort
of
a
claim
or
a
different
sort
of
a
situation
than
in
shannon
because
that
was
a
case
for
injuries
to
buildings
received
by
--
during
a
possession
or
occupation
by
soldiers
of
the
united
states.
in
that
of
course,
there
was
a
contract
of
sale,
there
was
a
separate
assignment
of
that
particular
claim
as
such.
and
there
were
still
a
divided
court.
but
i
might
say
to
--
say
this
to
you
that
here,
under
texas
law,
the
deed
could
not
pass
a
mere
claim
for
damages.
they
--
what
it
could
pass
was
the
title
to
the
property,
carrying
with
it
what
the
--
the
fullness
that
the
texas
law
gives
to
the
word
"title".
included
in
that
would
be
the
right
to
this
--
when
the
title
of
to
the
property,
the
right
to
receive
it,
all
clear
of
the
government's
claim
that
they
should
abandon
or
the
right
to
receive
the
award,
if
they
should
then
or
thereafter
go
ahead
and
decide
to
take
the
property
as
they
did.
and
counsel
has
called
this
an
ambivalent
proceeding.
i
think
that
he
is
quoting
from
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
in
the
case
of
40,000
square
feet
of
land
in
--
40,379
square
feet
of
land
in
58
f.supp.
which
is
in
our
brief.
and
in
that
case,
while
it's
a
trial
court,
there
is
rather
full
discussion
of
the
ambivalent
procedures
adopted
by
the
government.
and
i
think
that
the
point
made
by
counsel
is
there
alluded
too
also
and
that
is
that
harassed
government
counsel
not
quite
knowing
for
sure
which
way
to
move,
are
responsible
for
the
running
off
in
two
directions
at
one
time
that
occurs
when
two
or
three
or
four
condemnation
statutes
are
attempted
to
be
applied.
one
will
be
started
with
and
then
another
one
will
be
found
in
the
books
and
was
decided
that
perhaps
this
other
one
would
do
better.
but
while
we
have
is
--
we
have
here
a
constitutionl
question
on
what
passes.
and
i
say
again
that
the
taking
referred
to
by
the
government,
it
has
no
magic
in
those
words.
it
has
a
--
the
--
there
is
a
taking
of
possession,
there
is
a
physical
seizure.
there
--
that
is
one
facet.
but
then
as
in
dickinson,
when
is
the
time
complete?
well,
it's
when
the
government
no
longer
can
back
out.
it's
when
their
bargain
is
struck,
it's
when
is
finally
the
die
is
cast
between
the
permanent
easement
and
an
--
and
a
temporary
wartime
use
and
occupation
of
land.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
he
is
not
entitled
and
he
doesn't
claim
it.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
i
think
that
any
landowner
and
i'm
perhaps
repeating
but
any
landowner
has
the
right
to
expect
from
his
government,
just
compensation.
and
he
has
more
--
he
has
a
right
to
know
more
and
to
know
less.
and
i
would
say
that
the
next
landowner
along
would
be
entitled
just
to
that.
if
he
is
the
--
if
he
is
the
landowner
when
possession
is
taken,
he
has
a
right
to
use
in
possession
until
he
conveys.
if
he
conveys
before
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
well
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
it
depends
on
what
they're
taking.
and
until
they
become
committed,
they
are
not
taking
title.
there's
a
taking
of
possession
but
there's
a
taking
of
title
and
that
only
occurs
when
the
government
becomes
committed
to
do
it
and
can't
back
away
from
it.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
and
that
is
when
the
declaration
of
taking
is
filed
under
the
very
terms
of
the
statute
as
it's
stated.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
for
purposes
of
the
amount
of
the
value
of
the
property?
that,
yes,
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
the
decision
of
the
court
below
does
not
cover
interest.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
nor
does
the
opinion
cover
that.
there
--
there
is
clearly
in
this
case
a
right
to
use
in
possession
which
follows
under
clear
texas
principles
of
law,
lies
in
the
vendors,
they're
in
court,
they
can
press
this.
this
case
hadn't
been
tried
yet,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
case
--
these
people
are
in
court.
the
vendors
are
in
court,
they
will
have
the
right
subject
to
possible
limitation
questions
to
press
their
claim
for
the
use,
occupation
and
--
and
possession
of
the
land
until
they
convey.
from
the
time
they
conveyed,
mr.
dow,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
will
have
a
right
to
use
possession
and
occupation
until
that
point
when
the
government
made
up
its
mind
when
it
was
going
to
take
in
this
property.
and
in
that
point
when
it
could
no
longer
back
away,
when
--
when
it
was
committed,
was
when
the
--
when
the
taking
of
the
title
occurred
and
when
the
government
became
committed
to
pay
for
the
title.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
that
is
certainly
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
the
respondent,
mr.
dow,
is
not
entitled
to
interest
before
he
acquire
the
property.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
let
me
just
read
from
3
nichols
at
page
23.
that's
section
8.5,
section
2.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
oh,
no.
the
decision
below
clearly
states
that
the
date
of
valuation
shall
be
the
date
that
possession
is
taken.
it's
in
about
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
your
honor,
respondent
was
the
owner
at
the
date
that
declaration
of
taking
was
filed
but
not
at
the
date
of
valuation.
well,
your
honor
maybe
familiar
with
the
laws
of
conversion.
there
are
many
instances
when
damages
are
assessed
at
a
different
time
than
either
the
time
of
trial
or
perhaps
the
time
of
injury
sometimes
past
intermediate
value
is
--
is
assessed.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
well,
your
honor,
the
title
to
the
property
under
our
constitution
passes
when
payment
is
made.
if
title
doesn't
pass
until
then
to
the
government,
then
the
landowner
has
a
right
to
convey
and
that's
what
all
of
these
cases
so
hold
and
the
--
his
vendor
--
vendee
acquires
with
his
title
as
an
incident
thereto,
the
right
to
the
award.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
do
agree
with
that,
but
the
question
of
the
content
of
that
taking
does
not
become
--
determined
until
the
time
of
final
judgment
in
tucker
proceedings.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
okay.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
well,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question,
i'm
sorry
i
interrupted
your
question.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
but
the
jump
from
the
date
of
taking
of
title
back
to
the
date
of
possession
is
one
which
the
--
which
the
highest
courts
of
the
first-pay
states
have
been
able
to
make
on
these
equitable
grounds
that
if
there
are
variations
in
value,
ups
and
downs,
it's
one
that
--
it
sometime
has
to
be
fixed
so
the
date
when
the
petitioners
filed
or
the
date
when
physical
possession
is
taken
is
as
good
as
it
was.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
that
is
it.
it's
a
--
it's
a
step
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
your
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
there
are
great
a
many
states
which
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
i
would
think
no.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
i
would
think
no.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
i
think
that
there
is
substantial
ground
for
the
equitable
rule
that
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
that
is
the
result,
there's
no
question.
that
is
the
result,
it's
the
value
of
the
date
possession
was
taken
under
the
holding
of
the
court
below
and
under
the
rule
that
--
that
we
expressed
here.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
sir
it
does.
it
does
and
as
i
say
further
a
number
of
the
first-pay
states
have
adopted
the
same
rule.
the
date
that
a
petition
is
filed
or
the
date
that
physical
possession
is
taken.
and
there
are
many
equitable
grounds
to
support
that,
again,
that
just
compensation
is
all
that's
necessary.
and
that
unless
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
your
honor,
i'm
sure
it
is.
it's
either
the
value
of
the
use
which
may
be
fixed
by
the
jury
upon
valuations
--
offered
in
evidence
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
then
--
then
that's
what
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
--
that
is
what
the
result
to
the
vendors
would
be
also.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
well,
in
texas
there
are
statues
governing
interest
after
the
declaration
of
taking
act
becomes
applicable.
well
of
course,
it
would
control
on
the
amount
of
interest.
i
would
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
6%,
the
declaration
of
taking
act,
i
believe,
provides
also
for
6%.
so
that
it
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
your
honor,
in
the
footnotes,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
cited
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
some
of
my
favorites.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
i
would
have
to
say
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
--
other
than
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
yes,
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
now
--
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
no,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
l.
keith
simmer
that
is
correct.
if
you
exclude
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
--
cherokee
nation
case
because
that
one
does
definitely
says
that
the
time
for
--
time
of
taking
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
is
a
time
when
title
passes
and
payment
is
due
as
of
that
time.
and
that
one
has
been
on
our
law
books
since
135
united
--
u.s.
and
this
--
this
opinion
is
no
new
departure,
it
is
no
new
departure.
it
is
--
it
is
one
which
achieves
just
compensation
to
be
paid
by
the
united
states
and
to
be
received
by
the
landowners
just
as
well
as
the
previous
cases
--
there
had
been
no
recent
cases
before
this
court.
and
the
cases,
as
i
admit
on
the
very
first
page
of
my
argument
in
my
brief,
such
as
albrecht,
such
as
anderson
versus
united
states,
the
23
tracts
of
land,
case
is
there,
which
without
facing
this
question
of
constitutional
and
the
declaration
of
taking
statute
which
looked
the
other
way,
which
their
--
their
considerations
looked
the
other
way.
but
the
constitution
and
this
question
of
what
a
vendor
takes
under
his
texas
deed
is
one
that
is
open
to
this
court
and
you're
not
committed
on
any
--
any
way,
shape
or
form
other
than
by
the
persuasiveness
of
principles
which
you
have
laid
down
such
as
in
dickinson
that
the
completion
of
the
taking
is
the
--
is
the
time
when
your
cause
of
action
accrues
for
limitation
purposes
or
other
things.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'll
leave
the
time
for
the
counsel.
