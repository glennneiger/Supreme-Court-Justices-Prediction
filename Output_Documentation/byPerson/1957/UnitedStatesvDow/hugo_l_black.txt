justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
provisions
was
that
--
when
does
interest
begin
to
run
in
connection
with
the
government,
(inaudible)
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
from
the
moment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
moment
they
take
possession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
a
suit
is
filed
under
the
tucker
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
after
it's
found
that
the
government
would
have
possession
at
a
certain
time
but
when
does
interest
begin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
does
it
begin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
does
it
began
and
it
took
place
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
time
it
took
possession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
tell
us
what
will
--
what
is
the
real
point
in
controversy
here?
will
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
to
pay
it
anymore
under
your
contention
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
that
consequence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
dow.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
are
dispute
between
them?
what
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
point
of
litigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
if
they
are
the
people
that
conveyed
it
to
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that's
your
contention.
but
suppose
they
get
the
money,
are
they
under
any
obligation
to
pay
dow
or
will
dow
lose
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
don't
--
you
say
that
--
of
course
the
government,
no
more
and
no
less?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
landowner
gets
no
more
and
no
less.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case
--
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
elsewhere.
if
the
interest
begins
to
run
from
the
taking,
then
the
question
of
when
it's
taken
isn't
important
with
reference
to
interest
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
it.
well,
that
--
that's
the
question
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
is
it
not
true?
the
landowner,
if
--
if
you
hold
that
the
landowner
has
no
interest
or
nothing
in
lieu
of
it,
until
the
government
chooses,
may
be
some
years
later
to
file
its
claim,
which
it
can
after
a
certain
provision.
why
couldn't
the
government
in
that
way
keep
the
landowner
from
getting
that
in
lieu
of
interest,
maybe
for
a
few
years?
if
you're
going
to
say
that
taking
is
not
at
the
time,
you
actually
take
possession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
delay
of
payment,
was
there?
from
the
time
possession
was
taken
if
it
only
counts
from
the
time
the
government
comes
in
and
files
its
later
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
get
a
--
how
can
--
what
--
what
bothers
me
then
is,
if
the
--
you'll
figure
this
from
the
time
of
the
possession
or
the
other
time,
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
the
possession
at
a
later
time,
rather
the
possession.
dow
here
did
not
own
this
property.
suppose
the
government
concluded
to
have
been
(inaudible)
as
you've
said
--
you
said
you
did
in
the
brief?
and
six
months
later,
they
--
suppose
dow
gets
it,
the
--
and
the
government,
there
was
no
practice.
could
dow
then
get
a
claim
made
to
him
--
or
--
or
could
--
the
other
man
transfer
that
land
to
him
so
that
he
could
get
that
part
of
dow's
claim
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
dow,
whether
in
man's
land
without
violating
the
anti-assignment
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
they
claim
for
damages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
it's
a
claim
for
taking
values
and
possess
--
possession
of
their
property
during
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
that
would
be
in
dow's
predecessors
of
the
title.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
it
begins
from
the
date
of
possession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
i
asked
the
government
counsel
because
i
don't
quite
understand
the
gist.
if
taking
--
i
assume
you
would
agree
here,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
anything
under
the
taking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
taking
here,
that's
when
the
government
here
in
this
case
filed
a
declaration
or
whatever
it
was,
put
in
the
money,
if
that's
the
time,
how
is
dow
entitled
to
get
anything
for
the
use
of
the
government
made
to
that
property
up
to
the
time
it
was
taken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
then
if
he
is
not,
it
might
--
i
don't
understand
why,
it
might
be
to
dow's
interest
here,
to
win
this
lawsuit.
but
what
about
the
next
landowner
if
the
property
was
taken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
then
--
the
government
then
--
the
law
that's
passed
wouldn't
give
them
the
right
to
hold
possession.
if
it
gives
them
the
right
to
hold
possession,
they
certainly
got
to
pay
somebody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he'll
pay
you
under
your
contention
--
if
anybody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time,
dow
didn't
own
it.
and
he's
gotten
assignment
of
it
after
that
time
which
is
--
is
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
true
when
it
is
the
effect
of
the
deed,
gives
the
benefit
of
the
assignment
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
when
the
government
takes
possession
of
a
property,
a
suit
could
be
filed
under
the
tucker
act
at
once?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
i
don't
see
any
cases
cited
by
judge
reed.
is
this
the
first
case
that
tell
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
--
not
--
well,
do
any
of
them
i've
looked
at.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
any
of
them
hold
that
before
this
that
the
takings
be
measured
as
he
said
it
was
here
rather
the
time
the
possession
was
taken?
any
--
any
federal
cases
under
the
federal
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
raised
that
in
a
dissent
previously.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
didn't
get
the
majority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
time
is
the
first
time
it's
been
here?
