rights
you
think
to
divert
business
which
normally
would
flow
to
denver
over
the
mountains
to
salt
lake?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
and
does
a
regulation
opposing
that
you
think
here
valid.
justice

e.
whittaker
in
the
vacuum
and
without
any
fact.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whom
i
--
justice

e.
whittaker
which
should
be
violating
this

if
you
bought
cattle

in
the
west
--
eastern

of
colorado
and
ship
them
on
or
encourage
others

e.
whittaker
you
would
not,
would
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
why
is
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
wouldn't
have
to
be
a
market
agency
on
the
denver
stock
yard
in
order
to
make
your
country
transactions
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
and
would
this
not
be
the
means
if
all
other
market
agencies
on
the
denver
yards,
transact
their
business
outside
the
yards
of
destroying
the

this
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
all
did
what
you're
doing,
(inaudible)
to
destroy
the
public
market
in
denver?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
not
think
in
that
circumstance,
mr.
thomas
that
would
it
be
essential
to
have
a
factual
showing
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
evils
needed
to
be
corrected
by
this
resolution
or
by
these

that
whether
they
were
responsive?

e.
whittaker
you
do
not.
