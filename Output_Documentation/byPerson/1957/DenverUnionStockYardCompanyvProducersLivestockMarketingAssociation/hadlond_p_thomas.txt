mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
may
it
please
the
court.
we
stood
before
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
we
stood
before
this
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
stand
here
and
we
will
continue
to
stand
upon
one
proposition.
that
proposition
is
this.
this
regulation
is
illegal
and
invalid
upon
its
face
as
a
matter
of
law.
evidence
without
ambit
cannot
be
given
vitality.
now,
something
being
invalid
upon
its
face
isn't
--
shouldn't
be
so
strange.
this
court
has
recently,
that's
january
13
in
the
staub
against
city
baxley
case
from
georgia
held
that
that
city
ordinance
down
there
was
invalid
upon
its
face
as
a
matter
of
law
which
required
one
who
had
solicit
membership
in
a
labor
union
to
secure
a
permit
from
the
mayor
of
the
city.
mr.
justice
whittaker
ought
that
decision
and
he
said
that
it
deprived
the
--
the
defendant
in
that
case
of
his
right
of
free
speech
without
getting
a
permit
from
the
mayor
and
for
that
reason,
the
ordinance
was
invalid
on
its
face.
now,
this
ordinance
here
is
nonetheless
invalid
on
its
face.
and
it
is
an
ordinance.
it
was
ordained
by
the
denver
union
stock
yard.
i
say
that
it
stands
out
on
the
face
of
this
ordinance
like
mr.
justice
black
said
in
his
opinion
issued
this
morning
in
the
northern
pacific
railroad
case
that
it
was
adopted
to
fence
out
competitors.
that's
the
language,
his
honor
used,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
this
unwholesome
regulation
i
submit.
now,
the
only
question
anymore
in
this
case
to
begin
with
was
and
still
is,
is
this
regulation
here
on
trial
illegal
on
its
face
as
a
matter
of
law?
how
did
it
come
up?
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
says
two
things.
first,
that
every
stockyard
company
must
furnish
reasonable
stockyard
services
on
reasonable
request
without
discrimination.
i
would
emphasize
those
words
without
discrimination.
then
it
says
also
that
every
stockyard
company
must
adopt
regulations
and
practices
that
are
--
that
are
just,
reasonable,
and
nondiscriminatory
and
that
every
regulation
which
is
unjust,
unreasonable,
or
discriminatory
--
discriminatory
is
invalid.
now,
there
is
where
we
start
out.
this
stockyard
company
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
do.
i
say
there
are
three
stockyards.
you
have
the
regulations
identical
with
this
and
they
were
all
adopted
after
this
one.
they
got
their
cue
from
denver.
they
were
inspired
and
one
of
them
is
los
angeles,
one
is
baltimore,
and
one
is
houston.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
this
was
adopted
may
11,
1955
and
those
others
were
adopted
a
month,
two
months,
and
three
months
of
los
angeles
10
days
later.
and
we
challenge
that
and
it's
still
before
the
--
before
the
department.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
up
to
that
time
every
stockyard
company
had
regulations
but
i
affirmed
none
like
this.
they
had
regulations
which
--
from
which
the
--
their
amicus,
the
american
stockyard
association
in
their
brief
have
taken
selective
excerpts
in
which
--
which
prohibit
going
on
the
yards
or
in
the
streets
so
that
entering
the
yards
and
interfering
with
the
movement
of
livestock
like
the
fort
worth
case
where
they
climbed
on
--
where
they
stopped
the
trucks
in
the
--
in
--
in
the
yards
and
dealt
with
the
drivers
and
bought
the
livestock,
unloaded
them
and
put
them
on
their
own
trucks
and
went
of.
then
they
cause
traffic
jams.
now
those
are
the
regulations
they
have
with
other
yards.
they
say
that
--
that
they
can't
on
the
ways
--
on
the
highways,
and
the
streets
adjacent
and
adjoining.
this
--
the
fact
that
no
one
has
ever
had
one
of
these
regulations
in
the
court
before
that
test,
in
my
opinion,
the
fact
that
there
are
none
such.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
yes.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
yes.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
it
violates
the
section
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no.
the
next
section
is
208
in
the
u.s.
code
entity,
which
says
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
every
stockyard
owner
and
market
agency
to
establish,
observe
and
enforce
just,
reasonable,
and
nondiscriminatory
regulations
and
practices
and
so
on
respecting
the
furnishing
of
stockyard
services
and
--
you'll
find
that
on
page
19
of
the
respondents
brief
your
honor.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
yes.
now
let
me
show
you
what
this
--
what
this
regulation.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
absolutely.
now,
let
me
tell
you.
what
the
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
--
i'll
explain.
the
act
recognizes
three
agencies.
there
is
the
stockyard,
there
is
the
market
agency,
that's
us,
commission
firms
who
buy
and
sell
on
commission
and
the
dealers.
the
dealer
buys
and
sells
on
his
own
account.
he
speculated
it.
denver
union
stock
yard
here
is
the
stockyard
where
the
commission
firm.
now,
this
regulation
says
that
no
market
agency
or
dealer
engaging
in
business
at
this
stockyard,
what,
shall
upon
the
stockyard
company
property
or
elsewhere,
or
elsewhere
even
anywhere
else
nor
show
any
other
person
on
the
stock
yard
company
solicit
business
for
other
markets
and
so
on
or
in
any
manner
to
further
attempt
to
divert
livestock
from
this
market
or
engage
in
any
practice
or
device
which
you
would
be
impair
or
interfere
with
the
normal
flow
of
livestock
to
the
public
market
at
this
stockyard
and
then
it
sets
up
its
own
definition,
say
the
normal
marketing
area
from
which
livestock
would
normally
come
to
this
market
is
so
and
so.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
u.s.
56
of
colorado.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
claimed
it
violates
both
section
205
and
section
208,
particularly
208
which
commands
the
stock
yard
companies
to
enact
nondiscriminatory
regulations
in
which
denounces
as
unlawful
every
discriminatory
regulation
or
practice.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
all
right.
how
do
we
know
it
is
discriminatory?
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
all
right,
it
means
this.
it
means
that
since
we
are
registered
at
the
denver
yard
like
many
others
and
incidentally,
as
you
have
been
told,
we
are
also
registered
at
los
angeles,
salt
lake,
and
ogden,
in
as
much
as
registered
to
denver
yard,
we
can't
go
out
in
the
country
and
buy
and
sell
between
two
growers.
we
can't
go
to
colorado
springs
for
example.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well
because
it
says
so.
it
says
we
can't
do
this
on
the
stock
yard
company
property
or
elsewhere.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no.
solicit
any
business
for
other
markets,
or
for
sale
at
outside
feed
yards,
or
at
country
points.
i
can't
go
and
sell
for
one
grower
to
another.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
the
normal
(voice
overlap)
the
normal
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no,
i
think
the
normal
flow,
if
the
court
please,
relates
to
this
diversion
practice
they've
mentioned
in
here
that
--
where
it
says,
we
may
not
in
any
manner
divert
or
attempt
to
divert
livestock
from
this
market
which
would
otherwise
normally
tend
to
the
stockyard
and
then
comes
the
normal
marketing
area.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
surely
it's
divertible.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
we
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
--
i
contend
we
don't
have
to
know
anymore
than
we
look
at
the
regulation
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
and
that's
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
and
let
me
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
let
me
explain
how
the
case
came
up.
let
me
explain
the
posture
of
this
case.
we
filed
this
complaint
and
we
said
in
our
complaint
before
the
secretary
this
regulation
is
wholly
invalid.
why?
because
it's
discriminatory.
and
then
they
answered.
and
we
said,
“we're
going
to
stand
does
we
say
here
we
do
now
upon
the
illegality
of
this
regulation
upon
its
face
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
so
on
december
the
23rd,
1955
after
the
case
had
come
an
issue,
we
filed
complainants
“election
to
rest”
and
we
say,
“it
comes
now
the
complainant
and
the
above
entitled
cause
and
states
that
the
challenged
regulation
of
respondents
is
illegal
and
invalid
upon
its
face.
that
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
the
complainant
elects
to
stay
and
upon
the
illegality
of
said
regulation
as
a
matter
of
law
and
states
that
it
will
not
present
evidence
in
this
cause
as
the
taking
of
evidence
is
unnecessary
to
determine
the
illegality
of
said
regulation
as
a
matter
of
law
wherefore
the
complainant
hereby
rests
and
submits
its
case
for
final
decision
by
the
secretary
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
then
what
did
they
do?
they
filed
--
they
took
up
the
challenge.
they
--
they
met
and
head
on.
they
filed
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
reads
thus,
comes
down
the
respondent
by
its
attorneys
and
moves
that
the
complaint
in
this
proceeding
be
dismissed
with
prejudice.
they
state
their
case
upon
it
too,
because
of
the
complainant's
failure
on
the
record
to
sustain
the
burden
of
making
a
prima
facie
case
in
support
of
the
complaint
as
evidence
by
its
election
not
to
offer
proof
of
its
allegation
and
not
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
hearing
examiners
rule
respectfully
submitted.
there
the
issue
was
sharply
drawn.
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
hearing
officer
say
at
that
point?
here
is
what
he
said.
he
said
the
complainant
was
freed
away
herein
and
to
state
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding
solely
upon
the
question
as
to
whether
the
disputed
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
he
elects
this.
he
said
you're
wrong.
it's
not
illegal
on
its
face.
you
have
the
right
to
state
your
case
on
it.
sure.
and
they
state
theirs
too
because
they'd
rather
head
on
with
the
motion
to
dismiss
when
we
filed
“election
to
rest”.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
beg
you
pardon.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
it
was
the
stock
yard
company,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
what
could
they
do?
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
to
do
what
they
did,
exactly.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
yes,
and
that
brought
the
matter
sharply
into
focus
for
decision,
what,
upon
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
this
regulation
as
a
matter
of
law
upon
its
face.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we
say
not.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
it
does.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
the
last
five
to
six
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no.
it
--
it
follows
county
lines
and
highways
if
the
court
please,
and
it
comprises
the
entire
west
56
of
the
state
of
colorado.
what
will
happen
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
not
a
bit.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
not
a
bit
and
if
they
make
this
one
stick
they'll
nudge
the
boundaries
all
over
the
united
states.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
don't
think
you
do,
very
frankly,
no.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
don't
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
don't
think
that
matters,
your
honor.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
it
--
it
tells
you
what
they
claim
the
normal
flow
is
that
they
charge
us
with
the
diverting?
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
sure.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
right.
what
it
says
is
that
on
all
livestock
which
originates
in
the
west
56
of
colorado,
our
market
agency
and
all
others
as
well
who
deal
out
there
must
see
that
every
head
of
livestock
we
handle
is
routed
in
the
denver
stockyard.
now
what
does
that
do?
that
makes
us
--
prevents
us
from
routing
any
to
kansas
city
and
it
prevents
to
see
what
is
also
from
this.
it
prevents
us
from
selling
from
one
grower
to
another
grower
right
out
there
in
colorado
springs
as
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to.
now,
it
means
that
under
this
regulation
that
if
we
propose
to
sell
from
one
grower
in
colorado
springs
to
another
grower
in
colorado
springs,
we
can
only
do
it
by
routing
that
livestock
to
the
denver
yard
and
shipping
it
back
to
that
bar,
a
little
decrease
process
or
else
pay
in
tribute
to
the
denver
yard.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
wonder
if
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
you
mean,
if
it
had
forbidden
us
to
pick
up
the
phone
on
the
denver
yard
and
calls
kansas
city
yard
and
say,
“we'll
ship
you
some
cattle
within
the
fence
of
denver.”
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
and
they
had
said
that
we
could
not
do
that.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
think
that
would
be
invalid
upon
its
face,
your
honor.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
the
same
as
the
others.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
absolutely.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
because
of
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
that
requires
them
to
render
as
stockyard
services
and
to
adopt
regulations
that
are
just,
reasonable,
and
nondiscriminatory.
and
i
say
that
regulation
would
be
discriminatory.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we
are
a
fiduciary.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
we
are
a
fiduciary.
our
principal
is
our
shipper
for
whom
we
are
acting.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
--
i
suppose
it's
depending
upon
there
--
being
there
and
operating
where
assigned
pens.
our
livestock
that
we
handle
come
in.
if
they're
kept
there,
they're
put
into
pens
and
held
there
by
us
and
then
out
they
go,
we
send
them
out.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
i
suppose
if
we
stop
doing
business
with
them
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
was
going
to
say
if
we
stop
from
the
dealers
stock,
i'd
guess
they'd
be
left
to
the
growers
themselves
to
deal
with.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
absolutely.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
yes,
sir.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we
don't
get
a
permit,
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
registered
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture
at
each
yard
and
repost
the
bond.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
that's
my
understanding.
now
of
course
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
these
judges,
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
that,
they're
from
all
over
the
country.
judge
louis
who
wrote
the
opinion
is
from
salt
lake
and
judge
huxman
is
from
new
mexico.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
all
right.
i'm
wrong.
i've
got
judge
bratton
--
judge
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
judge
pickett
of
wyoming.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no,
i'm
very
happy
to
have
you,
your
honor.
[laughs]
now
of
course
our
approach
to
this
is
simply
this.
that
under
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
and
the
famous
decision
of
stafford
against
wallace
of
this
court
immediately
following
the
enactment
of
the
act,
the
stock
yard
company
is
a
public
utility
and
being
such
is
bound
to
furnish
--
as
in
all
other
market
agencies
with
stockyard
services
without
discrimination.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no,
are
we
to
render
or
whereas
the
stockyard
to
render,
it
makes
a
difference.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
all
right.
as
a
(voice

--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we'd
render
them
there
in
that
instance
of
course.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
right.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
think
so.
we
say
so.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we
do.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we
do,
as
violative
of
the
fact
that
the
stockyard
cites
which
commands
the
stock
yard
company
to
furnish
us
with
stockyard
services
and
to
enact
and
observe
nondiscriminatory
regulations.
we
get
back
to
the
non
--
to
the
discriminatory
again.
we
say
that's
discriminatory.
their
court
of
appeals
said
so
too
from
up
the
cowboy
country,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
now,
of
course
every
public
utility
is
bound
to
serve
and
we
have
cited
the
cases,
many
of
them,
which
hold
that
a
public
utility
may
not
demand
exclusive
patronage
or
exclusive
allegiance
for
example
an
electric
company
cannot
say
if
you
--
if
you
burn
gas
also,
you
can
have
our
electricity.
and
a
railroad
company
can't
say
if
you
ride
the
airplanes,
you
can't
ride
our
--
our
trains
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
nor
public
utilities
deny
service
because
of
something
which
is
a
collateral
matter
--
something
which
is
collateral
to
the
service
they
furnish.
for
example,
i
can't
say
to
you
that
if
you
can
have
water
and
electricity
but
only
if
you
install
a
septic
tank.
now
we
say
here
that
this
regulation
demands
our
exclusive
patronage
our
exclusive
allegiance
and
also
it
denies
us
service
because
of
a
collateral
matter
namely
doing
business
out
in
the
country.
the
country
business
is
big
if
the
court
please.
that's
one
reason
we're
objecting
and
we
say
we've
got
a
right
to
go
out
in
the
country
and
sell
from
one
grower
to
another
and
that
the
denver
stock
yard
company
can't
stop
us
by
regulation.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
we
do
two
kinds
of
business,
if
the
court
please.
we
do
a
business,
a
grower
will
give
us
--
send
us
livestock
to
sell
on
consignment
for
example
at
the
stockyard
and
we
will
ship
it
there
and
it
will
be
sold
there,
on
the
other
hand
--
some
grower
will
say
to
us
find
a
buyer
for
our
livestock
and
we
do
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we
have
people
out
in
the
country.
we
do
have
tremendous
country
business,
if
the
court
please.
that's
what
it
states
here.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
oh,
no,
not
near.
no.
i
should
say
not.
i
would
say
most
of
it
sold
in
the
country.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
it
might
be
in
the
midwest.
i
don't
think
there
is
in
the
west
where
denver,
where
los
angeles,
salt
lake,
ogden
and
then
there
are
yards
that
are
not
posted
for
example,
phoenix
and
brawley.
they're
not
imposed
to
stockyard
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
the
quarrel
is
about
whether
we
can
sell
--
buy
and
sell
in
the
country
part
of
colorado
or
whether
we've
got
to
ship
all
that
stuff
to
the
denver
yard.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
we've
--
there's
no
question
about
it
or
what.
we
will
get
livestock
in
the
country
and
ship
it
to
kansas
city
if
somebody
wants
us
to.
and
right
then,
we'd
be
violating
and
we
would
report
this
regulation.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
i
don't
know
why
it's
(voice
overlap).
it
maybe
--
it
maybe
that
the
grower
will
say
we
--
i
think
you
can
get
me
a
better
price
at
kansas
city
or
we
may
think
of
the
case.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
we
would
not.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
because
they
say
that
--
they
take
the
position
at
least
that
this
thing
implies
today
only
to
that
west
56.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
now,
if
they
were
in
this
lawsuit,
they're
going
to
push
those
boundaries
all
over
the
united
states
like
los
angeles
has
done
or
has
attempted
to
do.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
he
hasn't
said
anything
yet
and
los
angeles'
regulation
is
passed
the
time
of
complaint.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
oh,
no.
that
would
result
if
we
have
to.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
which
they
do,
if
the
court
please.
they
do
just
like
we
do.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
--
i
supposed
that
if
you
--
you
ask
me
if
we
and
all
the
other
market
agencies,
buy
and
sell
in
the
country,
it
reduces
the
livestock
that
moves
for
the
denver
stock
yard
of
course
and
that's
why
of
the
regulation.
now,
let
me
say
this
too,
that
the
american
stockyard
association
in
their
brief
amicus
curiae
has
pointed
out
that
very
thing
that
when
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
was
passed
in
1921,
90%
of
all
livestock
moved
through
these
posted
stockyards.
whereas
today,
only
about
60%
moves
through
and
it's
going
down
all
the
time,
you
can
see
the
reason
for
the
regulation,
trying
to
force
this
economic
effect.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
think
it
would
be
--
they
are
trying
to
get
the
law
changed
if
they
can.
well
i
say
this
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
don
t
think
he
has
any
such
power,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
never
heard
of
that.
now,
i
don't
think
that
i
have
anymore
to
say
your
honors.
i
think
you
have
the
case
very
well
in
mind.
it
--
it
went
off
entirely
on
the
question
of
the
illegality
of
this
thing
upon
its
face
as
a
matter
of
law
and
we
say
that
is
exactly
where
we
stood
and
where
we
continue
to
stand.
if
we
are
right
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
right,
the
judgment
must
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
if
i
have
ten
more
minutes
---
moment
--
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i
understood
i
have
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
well,
i
am
answering
mr.
justice
black's
question
as
i
understood.
mr.
hadlond
p.
thomas
i'm
sorry.
i
