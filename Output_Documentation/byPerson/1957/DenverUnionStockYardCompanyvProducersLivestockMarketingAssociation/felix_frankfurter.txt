i

may
i
interrupt

justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
understand.
the
stockyard
owner
sought
to
get
data
from
the
producers
in
order
to
prove
that
the
regulations
of
the
stockyard
owner
issue
were
reasonable
and
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
why
the
stockyard
owner
wouldn't
have
those
materials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
point
of
subpoenaing
the
complaining
producers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
circumventions
proper
function
of
the
stockyard
owner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
data
relating
to
those
circumventions
were
in
the
possession
of
the
producers,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
stockyard,
are
provisions
made
for
services
rendered
or
duties
that's
charged
at
the
stockyard
which
bear
on
what
i
might
call
healthy
certification
practices
by
the
stockyards
from
the
point
of
view
ultimately
of
the
belief
that
you
and
i
gather.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether,
when
you
speak
of
the
normal
flow,
does
the
normal
flow
bring
livestock
to
the
denver
yard
or
to
other
yards
and
at
the
yard,
practices
or
services
rendered
by
the
yard
which
hereon
the
proper
protection
of
the
ultimate
needs
consumed
by
the
consumers
of
united
states?
what
do
they
do?
in
other
words,
what
is
there
that
should
justify
a
regulation
making
a
flow
normal?
why
shouldn't
the
--
why
shouldn't
the
dealer
do
with
his
cattle,
his
livestock
what
he
wants
to
do?
why
should
there
be
a
normal
flow?
maybe
that
comes
in
later
but
--
otherwise,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
--
i
have
this
difficulty
of
seeing
these
things
into
blank.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
how
i
can
tell
whether
he's
entitled
to
a
natural
flow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
state
in
the
sections
what
the
court
did
here
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sections
which
you're
revieiwing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
that
you
won't
take
much
time
to
answer
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
will
be.
in
the
first
place
(inaudible)
--
in
the
first
place,
this
regulation
pertains
exclusively
--
we
are
concerned
merely
with
the
regulations
affecting
denver.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
second
question
is
this.
would
it
not
have
been
open
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
that
the
whole
administrative
process
no
matter
what
the
producer
said
to
--
should
appear
into
these
problems
and
have
witnesses
put
on
the
stand
and
explore
the
situation
no
matter
what
kind
of
summary
on
the
base
of
the
regulation
issue,
the
producer
has
presented.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
to
--
i
didn't
mean
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
won't
you
go
on
in
this
very
proceeding?
would
you
have
to
start
a
new
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
in
a
position
--
isn't
the
scope
of
your
process
that
make
you
to
say,
we
have
to
pass
on
the
legality
of
a
challenged
regulation
and
the
party
can
circumscribe
the
litigation
so
as
to
exclude
what
the
department
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
means
relevant
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sellers,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
for
me
to
understand
this
more
clearly.
i
suppose
nobody
on
this
court
is
more
eager
to
deny
it
but
cattle
countries
or
livestock
industry
for
a
better
understanding.
do
i
understand
it
the
denver
market
has
x
number,
12
or
15
to
indicate
a
relatively
small
number
of
people
who
get
a
license
--
out
of
license
from
the
department
or
an
authorization
from
the
department
of
agriculture
to
do
business
within
the
denver
market
and
that
means
to
have
certain
store
or
whatever
you
call
them
in
order
there
to
do
bidding
with
other
people,
other
market
agencies.
presumably,
if
they
ask
me
to
do
business
in
the
denver
market,
they
wanted
to
do
business
in
the
denver
market.
now,
do
i
understand
that
this
regulation
circumscribed
their
freedom
to
do
business
elsewhere?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
address
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
for
certain
limitation
or
in
some
way
it
curtails
their
freedom
to
do
what
they
please
in
relation
to
the
denver
market,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
what
is
there
in
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
which
define,
if
not
in
terms
by
the
implications
of
the
duties
and
services
to
be
rendered,
the
obligation
to
carry
on
business
for
the
denver
market
for
which
their
license
--
license
and
(inaudible)
their
unlimited
freedom
to
do
business
in
any
other
markets
to
which
they
also
may
have
a
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does
to
some
extent
curtail
their
freedom.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
validity
under
faith
must
either
mean
that
to
make
any
regulation
curtailing
their
freedom
although
they
own
a
license
for
the
denver
market
and
there
is
this
statutory
construction
scheme
that's
been
summarized
or
that
on
the
basis,
the
kind
of
limitation
of
freedom
that
it
sees
the
denver
agency,
it's
obviously
a
discriminatory
or
exemplary
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
doesn't
--
the
regulation
doesn't
fit
your
denver
agency,
you
can
take
business
to
ship
cattle
to
los
angeles,
it
doesn't
do
that,
does
it
or
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
--
why
would
they
say
that
he'd
be
registered
for
denver
unless
it
wanted
to
do
also
denver
business.
it
wouldn't,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
justify
the
regulation
in
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
this
--
is
this
your
case,
mr.
sellers?
that
packers
and
stockyards
back
of
1921
took
over
packers
and
stockyards
business
in
interstate
commerce.
that
extent
is
elaborated
or
rather
detailed
scheme
subjecting
the
stockyard
public
utility
regulations
and
creating
things
called
market
agency
as
business
for
the
conduct
of
the
stockyard.
while
it
maintained
a
competitive
system
in
order
to
make
the
scheme
functional,
in
order
to
enable
the
stockyards
to
carry
out
their
belief,
they
had
to
be
effective
functioning
market
agency.
and
in
order
to
have
effective
market
agencies,
there
have
to
be
a
certain
(inaudible),
a
certain
circumscription
of
freedom
of
action
by
the
market
agency.
and
whether
or
not,
a
restriction
from
the
conduct
of
the
market
agencies
in
carrying
out
not
only
their
duty
but
to
enable
the
stockyard
to
live
and
function,
you
have
to
know
what
the
facts
are
in
a
particular
market.
is
that
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
admit
what
mr.
justice
black
said
and
say
you
can't
tell
and
do
all
the
facts
to
shed
on
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
it's
nondiscriminatory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
i
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
flow
naturally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
normal
flow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
sort
of
the
qualification
of
the
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
should
think
that
the
court
(inaudible)
away
from
substance
otherwise
in
the
normal
court
(inaudible)
denver
that
--
that's
divertible
to
denver.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
i
know
what
the
effect
of
this
is
or
what
the
secretary
would
construe
the
regulation
fee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
spends
endless
time
on
matters
of
legislative
history
because
of
these
contentions
have
favorably
endless
time.
i
didn't
mean
to
shut
off
the
law
in
this
regulation.
why
can't
you
being
--
what
is
the
relationship
--
a
company
of
the
stockyard
is
to
the
(inaudible)
of
the
market
agency?
why
this
court
be
shut
off
of
knowing
those
(inaudible)
i'm
asking
in
the
inadvertence
of
light
instead
of
speculation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
about
these
things
but
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap)
think
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
you
told
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
very
often
it
looks
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
find
out
its
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thomas,
may
i
suggest
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
my
experience
on
this
court
has
been
that
sometimes
of
the
statute
is
conflicting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thomas,
do
we
know
whether
the
metes
and
bounds
or
the
metes
and
bound
is
the
trickiest
flow
of
business.
do
we
not
know
--
do
we
know
--
does
anybody
that
we're
entitled
to
make
judicial
office
--
judicial
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
we
don't
know
whether
the
metes
and
bounds
did
represent
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
x
number
of
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well
all
i'm
saying
is
that
those
metes
and
bounds
won't
tell
us
anything
except
the
metes
and
bounds.
it
doesn't
tell
us
the
significance
of
the
metes
and
bounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
functioning
of
the
stockyard
is
highly
dependent
on
what
the
marketing
agent
could
do,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
instance,
you
stop
doing
business
with
them
for
fishing
areas,
would
that
not
affect
the
stockyard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
on
a
stockyard,
wouldn't
that
affect
them
and
wouldn't
have
to
--
have
a
right
to
do
something
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
you
disqualify
those
of
us
who
don't
know
anything
about
that
problem?
