the
stockyard
initiates
and
filed
the
regulations?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
a
hearing
on
those
regulations?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there's
no
hearing
unless
there's
an
objection.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
secretary
on
his
own
(inaudible).
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
there
any
objection
here
by
anybody?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
means
that
the
--
with
that
--
with
that
hypothesis
in
the
stockyard
(inaudible)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
the
case
been
admissible
to
that
in
the
record.
justice
william
o.
douglas
denver
stock
yard
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
most
of
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
includes
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
both
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
not
the
agent.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
it
include
any
state
like
utah
or
whatever?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
the
man
is
down
in
colorado
springs.
(inaudible)
you
can't
get
the
services
of
the
stockyard
in
denver.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
a
question.
i
mean
not
a
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
any
--
any
discrimination
here
against
the
producer?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
regulation
purports
to
be
a
discrimination
against
the
marketing
agent.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
does
it
work
against
the
producer?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
judicial
officer,
he
didn't
attack
that
part
of
the
--
or
he
don't
discuss
particularly
that
part
of
the
regulation.
he
assumed
that
this
was
a
regulation
that
forbid
as
it
does
in
part
from
the
solicitation
of
business
in
the
stockyard,
away
from
that
stockyard
to
another.
would
you
think
that
that
would
be
a
valid
regulation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
at
the
top
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
27
and
at
the
top
of
page
--
for
example,
he
said,
the
regulation
in
part
prohibits
conduct
of
on
the
stock
yard
company's
property
that
diverts
livestock
in
the
designated
area
from
the
respondent's
stockyard.
suppose
the
regulation
had
not
gone
any
further
than
that,
would
it
be
valid?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes
it
is.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
same
as
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
soliciting
in
the
country.
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
--
rights
as
if
the
marketing
agent
in
that
circumstance
would
be
a
sort
of
a
fiduciary.
justice
william
o.
douglas
an
agent
with
--
duties
to
the
--
to
the
principal
which
would
be
the
stockyard.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
judicial
officer
didn't
so
construe
it.
he
construed
the
controversy
before
him
as
one
where
denver
stock
yard
was
compelled
to
furnish
its
facilities
to
the
benefit
of
its
competitors
in
kansas
city.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
he
addressed
himself
to
that
solicitation
in
the
stock
yard
that
i
asked
you
about
