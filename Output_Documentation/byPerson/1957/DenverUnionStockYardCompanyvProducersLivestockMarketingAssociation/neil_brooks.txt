mr.
neil
brooks
if
the
court
please.
the
centric
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
certain
regulations
issued
by
the
stockyard
owner
in
denver
pursuant
to
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
are
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
or
stating
the
question
in
the
language
used
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
question
is
whether
the
regulations
in
the
absence
of
evidence
are
illegal
on
their
face.
these
regulations
were
issued
by
the
stockyard
owner
with
respect
to
the
furnishing
of
what
the
statute
calls
reasonable
stockyard
services.
the
denver
stock
yard
has
been
posted
for
regulation
under
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
since
1921.
and
the
market
agent
says
and
the
dealers
at
that
stock
yard
are
also
subject
to
the
regulatory
terms
of
the
statute.
this
litigation
had
its
origin
in
a
complaint
which
was
filed
with
the
department
of
agriculture
by
a
market
agency
at
the
denver
stock
yard.
a
market
agency
is
by
statutory
definition,
a
person
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
or
selling
livestock
on
a
commission
basis
at
a
posted
stockyard.
a
complaint
in
this
case
was
filed
by
the
producers
livestock
marketing
association,
a
corporate
entity
which
is
registered
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
a
market
agency
at
this
stockyard.
that
is
to
say
the
complainant
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
livestock
on
a
commission
basis
at
the
denver
stock
yard.
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
certain
regulations
issued
by
the
stockyard
owner
are
for
various
reasons
invalid.
and
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
is
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
after
an
adjudicatory
proceeding,
set
aside
the
stock
yard
company's
regulations
or
as
the
complaint
terms
it,
annulled
those
regulations.
before
explaining
the
regulations
--
mr.
neil
brooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
not
at
that
time.
the
hearing
may
come
later,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
he
can
indeed.
the
statute
expressly
so
provides.
mr.
neil
brooks
there
was
an
objection
here
by
the
market
agency,
the
complainant
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
that
objection
was
filed
properly
after
these
regulations
were
filed
with
the
department
of
agriculture.
perhaps,
it
will
be
helpful
too,
your
honor,
if
i
explain
at
once
two
or
three
of
the
statutory
provisions
which
are
at
the
very
center
of
this
case,
statutory
provisions
which
are
cited
in
the
complaint
and
which
are
relied
on
by
the
complainant
now
as
well
as
then.
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
imposed
certain
duties
on
a
stockyard
owner
and
a
market
agency.
and
it
provides
that
if
there's
a
breach
of
one
of
those
duties,
a
complaint
maybe
filed
by
any
person,
a
private
person
or
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
after
adjudicatory
proceeding,
a
decision
maybe
made
by
the
agency
with
judicial
review
later.
now,
the
first
of
the
two
statutory
duties
that
are
involved
here
is
this.
the
statute
provides
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
a
stockyard
owner
and
a
market
agency
to
furnish
upon
reasonable
request
without
discrimination,
reasonable
stockyard
services
at
the
stockyard.
mr.
neil
brooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
he
may
issue
a
complaint
himself,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
he
may
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
no,
your
honor.
the
first
duty
then
that's
specified
in
the
statute
is
the
duty
on
the
part
of
a
stockyard
owner
and
a
market
agency
and
this
is
the
very
language
of
the
statute.
it's
the
duty
on
the
part
of
a
stockyard
owner
and
a
market
agency
to
furnish
upon
reasonable
request
without
discrimination,
reasonable
stockyard
services
at
the
stock
yard.
now,
the
pivotal
term
in
that
statutory
language,
the
pivotal
term
reasonable
stockyard
services
is
not
defined
in
the
statute,
neither
is
there
any
definition
of
the
word
reasonable
as
it's
used
in
that
term,
reasonable
stockyard
services.
there
is,
however,
a
statutory
definition
of
a
part
of
that
term,
namely,
stockyard
services
as
such.
the
statutory
definition
of
that
term
is
in
words
of
--
throughout
generality.
the
definition
is
this.
the
term
stockyard
services
means
facilities
undefined
or
services
undefined
in
connection
with
the
receiving
of
livestock,
the
watering,
the
feeding
and
the
holding
of
livestock
and
the
buying
and
the
selling
and
the
marketing
of
livestock
and
the
shipment
of
livestock
at
a
posted
stockyard.
so
the
first
duty
is
that
a
stockyard
owner
and
a
market
agency
must
furnish
upon
reasonable
request
without
discrimination,
reasonable
stockyard
services.
the
second
duty
specified
in
the
statute
is
this.
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
a
stockyard
owner
and
a
market
agency
to
issue,
observe,
and
enforce
just,
reasonable,
and
nondiscriminatory
regulations
with
respect
to
the
furnishing
of
stockyard
services.
mr.
neil
brooks
a
duty,
your
honor.
that's
the
very
language
of
the
statute.
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
a
stockyard
owner
and
a
market
agency
to
issue,
observe
and
enforce
just,
reasonable,
and
nondiscriminatory
regulations
with
respect
to
the
furnishing
of
stockyard
services.
the
last
statutory
provision
in
the
group
that
justice
douglas
probably
referred
to
is
this
provision.
the
statute
says
that
any
person,
that's
the
term
in
the
statute,
any
person,
who
has
agreed
by
what
he
regards
as
a
breach
of
one
of
those
statutory
duties,
may
file
a
complaint
with
the
department
of
agriculture.
also,
the
statute
provides
that
the
administrative
agency
itself
may,
on
its
own
motion,
file
a
complaint
if
it
regards
inappropriate
in
the
situation.
the
statute
then
provides
that
in
either
event
whether
the
complaint
is
filed
by
a
private
person
or
whether
the
complaint
is
filed
by
the
administrative
agency
itself
in
either
event.
if
the
secretary
concludes
on
the
basis
of
the
hearing
record
and
the
statute
refers
to
what
it
calls
a
full
hearing,
if
the
secretary
concludes
on
the
basis
of
that
record
that
any
rate
or
charge
or
any
regulation
or
practice
in
connection
with
the
furnishing
of
stockyard
services
is
unjust,
unreasonable,
or
discriminatory,
then
the
secretary
may
set
aside
the
rate
or
charge
or
the
regulation
or
practice,
and
the
secretary
may,
on
the
basis
of
that
record,
prescribe
the
rate
or
charge
or
the
regulation
or
practice
which
is
and
will
be
just,
reasonable,
and
nondiscriminatory.
those
i
believe
are
the
three
statutory
provisions
which
are
at
the
center
of
the
case.
the
complaint,
as
i
said
earlier,
was
filed
by
a
market
agency
asserting
that
certain
regulations
issued
by
the
stockyard
owner
are
violative
of
those
statutory
provisions
and
are
also
in
other
respects
that
i
will
get
to
later,
illegal
and
invalid.
it
was
decided
by
the
administrative
agency
and
that
decision
appears
in
the
record
that
this
proceeding
should
go
forward
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
filed
by
the
producers
livestock
marketing
association
as
the
complainant
and
the
of
course
the
denver
union
stock
yard
company,
the
stockyard
owner
as
the
respondent.
accordingly,
the
complaint
was
served
on
the
respondent,
an
answer
was
filed
denying
the
various
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
to
whether
or
not
these
regulations
are
just,
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory.
the
answer
filed
by
the
respondent
admits
--
admits
that
it
issued
the
regulations
as
they're
quoted
in
the
complaint
and
it
admits
that
the
complainant
is
registered
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
a
market
agency
at
denver.
but
in
all
other
respects
or
at
least
in
all
other
material
respects,
the
answer
denies
the
factual
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
demands
what
it
calls
strict
proof
on
the
part
of
the
complainant.
we
come
now
to
an
interesting
and
unexpected
development
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
this
case
was
assigned
to
a
hearing
examiner
and
the
parties
were
preparing
for
the
hearing.
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
with
the
hearing
examiner
for
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
for
certain
books
and
records
of
the
complaint.
it
being
alleged
in
the
motion
filed
by
the
respondent
that
those
books
and
records
of
the
complainant
were
relevant
and
material
to
the
practices
in
the
market
which
gave
rise
to
the
issuance
of
these
regulations
and
which
would
show
the
need
for
the
regulations
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulations.
the
complainant
resisted
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
although
it
did
not
deny
and
the
record
shows
it.
it
did
not
deny
the
relevance
of
the
books
and
records.
mr.
neil
brooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
has
part
of
his
proof,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
the
stockyard
owner
does
have
some
of
those
materials,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
the
stockyard
owner
has
the
records
with
respect
to
livestock
that
actually
passed
through
the
stockyard.
the
main
thrust
of
the
regulations
or
at
least
a
main
thrust
of
the
regulations,
relates
to
transactions
in
which
a
market
agency
at
the
stockyard
circumvented
the
delivery
of
the
livestock
to
the
stockyard
or
as
the
regulation
terms
it
interfered
with
the
normal
flow
of
livestock
to
the
stockyard
either
by
diverting
direct
to
packer
or
diverting
to
some
other
market.
although
the
stockyard
owner
has
records
of
all
shipments
that
actually
went
through
the
stockyard,
the
records
of
the
stockyard
owner
were
not
complete
with
respect
to
these
off
market
transactions
which
are
largely
and
critically
involved
in
the
issuance
of
the
regulation.
mr.
neil
brooks
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
the
--
the
stockyard
owner
claimed
that
there
were
practices
which
we
deem
evidently
elicit
--
mr.
neil
brooks
exactly.
mr.
neil
brooks
exactly.
mr.
neil
brooks
exactly.
exactly,
your
honor.
now
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neil
brooks
i
believe
that's
little
too
much
of
an
abbreviation,
your
honor.
there
are
two
affidavits
in
the
record
which
explained
numerous
transactions.
i
hesitate
at
the
moment
to
discuss
that
part
of
the
case.
i'd
like
to
defer
it
for
a
few
minutes
--
mr.
neil
brooks
--
if
i
may.
in
its
stout
resistance
to
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
duces
tecum,
the
complainant
filed
what
he
called
an
election,
an
election
to
state
its
case
on
the
narrow
circumscribed
proposition
that
these
regulations
in
the
absence
of
evidence
are
illegal
on
their
face.
the
election
filed
by
the
complainant
stated
and
these
are
the
words
in
that
election.
that
the
complainant
will
not
present
evidence
in
this
case,
and
that
the
case
is
to
be
disposed
of
so
far
as
the
complainant
is
concerned.
on
the
one
narrow
proposition
that
these
regulations
are
invalid
on
their
face
as
a
matter
of
law.
accordingly,
the
hearing
examiner
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
the
matter
then
went
to
the
judicial
officer
in
the
department
of
agriculture
and
in
a
rather
elaborate
opinion
in
the
record
of
course.
the
judicial
officer
concluded
that
these
regulations
are
not
as
a
matter
of
law
just
in
the
abstract
in
vacuo
illegal.
perhaps,
i
should
say
a
word
at
this
point
as
to
the
regulations
themselves.
in
the
main
--
in
the
main,
the
regulations
provide
that
a
stock
--
that
a
market
agency
or
a
dealer
at
the
stockyard
shall
not
interfere.
that's
the
critical
word
in
the
regulation,
shall
not
interfere
with
what
the
regulations
refer
to
as
the
normal
flow
of
livestock
to
the
denver
market.
that
the
interference
shall
not
be
by
way
of
diversion
elsewhere
and
that
a
market
agency
or
a
dealer
at
the
stockyard
shall
not
solicit,
that's
the
word
used
in
the
regulations,
shall
not
solicit
livestock
business
for
disposition
elsewhere.
mr.
neil
brooks
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
i'm
not
sure
i
fully
understood
your
honor's
question.
mr.
neil
brooks
it
is
difficult
to
see
them
in
the
abstract.
in
fact,
that's
the
main
position
that
our
department
takes
that
the
validity
of
these
regulations
in
their
entirety
can
be
ascertained
only
on
the
basis
of
a
thorough
evidentiary
consideration
of
all
of
the
conditions
and
circumstances
in
that
great
market
that
you
cannot
just
as
a
matter
of
law
in
the
abstract
as
justice
frankfurter
just
said,
that
you
cannot
in
the
abstract
pass
upon
the
validity
of
these
regulations.
mr.
neil
brooks
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
exactly,
your
honor.
exactly.
that,
i
should
say,
is
our
position
in
a
nutshell.
its
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
whole
thrust
of
the
case
and
that
was
the
exact
decision
of
the
judicial
officer.
he
refrained.
he
expressly
refrained
from
saying
whether
or
not
the
regulations
are
valid
or
invalid.
he
simply
said
that
in
the
absence
of
evidence,
“we
cannot
determine
that
they
are
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law.”
mr.
neil
brooks
yes,
i
believe.
mr.
neil
brooks
i
believe
i
can,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
disposed
of
the
case
on
the
basis
of
a
hypothetical
situation.
it
assumed.
it
indulged
in
what
we
call
dualistic
assumptions
of
fact.
it
said
that
if,
and
that's
the
word
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
a
market
agency
is
registered
at
denver
and
is
also
registered
at
some
competitive
posted
stockyard
and
if
the
regulations
in
their
application
would
prohibit
the
market
agency
from
performing
reasonable
stockyard
services
at
one
stockyard
or
the
other
then
in
that
undisclosed
hypothetical
situation,
said
the
court
of
appeals,
the
regulation
would
be
invalid
even
though
it
added
that
the
condition
existing
on
the
part
of
a
market
agency
in
subverting
the
business
of
the
stockyard
where
it
is
afforded
free
space
to
do
business
might
bring
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
inefficient
operations
at
that
stockyard
even
redounding
to
the
failure
to
have
reasonable
stockyard
services
there.
but
nonetheless,
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
basis
of
that
dualistic
assumption
of
facts,
said
that
accordingly
the
regulations
are
illegal
and
ordered
the
administrative
agency
to
issue
a
cease-and-desist
order.
our
brief
considers
this
at
a
considerable
length.
mr.
neil
brooks
a
market
agency
at
denver
maybe
registered
at
some
other
posted
stockyard.
i
should
add,
your
honor,
and
i
should
make
this
clear.
mr.
neil
brooks
there
was
no
evidence.
there
was
no
witness.
we
just
have
the
--
pardon
me.
mr.
neil
brooks
candidly,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
producers
is
registered
at
a
competing
posted
stockyard.
mr.
neil
brooks
i
understand
they
are
not
registered
at
kansas
city.
perhaps
i
should
explain.
i
understand
that
there
are
two
or
three
corporate
entities
in
this
country
by
the
name
of
producers
livestock
marketing
association.
they
are
separate
entities
although
as
i
understand
all
of
this
outside
the
record,
if
the
court
please.
as
i
understand,
there
is
some
overwriting
association
or
i
don't
know
just
what
the
nature
of
that
association
is
between
those
various
corporate
entities.
but
i
can
still
say
to
the
court
in
all
candor
that
there
are
two
or
three,
maybe
more,
corporate
entities
for
the
name
of
producers
livestock
marketing
association
which
operate
in
various
stockyards
throughout
the
country.
i
should
say
also
in
complete
candor
to
the
court
that
i
understand
that
this
particular
corporate
entity
is
registered
as
a
market
agency
at
los
angeles
and
at
one
or
two
other
stockyards,
salt
lake
city
and
ogden.
now,
harking
back
for
a
moment
to
the
hypothetical
situation
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
disposed
of
the
case.
i
don't
know
your
honor
and
there's
no
evidence
here
to
deal
with
it.
i
don't
know
which
stockyards
are
competitive
with
the
others
and
how
much
they
are
competitive.
i
do
know
that
there
are
about
600
posted
stockyards
throughout
the
country.
some
of
them
are
great
terminal
stockyards
like
denver
and
chicago
and
six
or
eight
others.
many
of
them
are
very
small
auction
markets,
and
the
way
of
doing
business,
even
the
way
of
selling
livestock
widely
various
in
those
hundreds
of
stockyards
throughout
the
country.
in
the
terminal
stockyards,
livestock
is
not
ordinarily
sold
by
the
auction
method.
the
buying
and
the
selling
of
it
results
from
the
livestock
being
consigned
by
the
owner
to
a
market
agency
or
a
dealer
at
the
stockyard
and
then
its
--
it's
sold
by
negotiation
between
that
agent
and
the
prospective
buyer,
whereas,
probably
400
or
500
other
stockyards
throughout
the
country
where
they
have
auction
methods
of
sale
is
disposed
off
by
the
auction
method,
but
even
that
is
not
uniform
and
never
has
been
prior
to
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
or
since
the
passage
of
this
packers
and
stockyards
act.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
neil
brooks
yes.
mr.
neil
brooks
i
hope
it
won't
be
a
charge
to
my
associate
here.
mr.
neil
brooks
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
neil
brooks
i'm
eager
to
explain
that,
your
honor.
i
just
hope
it
won't
be
a
charge
to
my
associate's
time.
well,
when
this
complaint
was
filed,
it
had
factual
allegations
in
it.
those
allegations
were
denied
by
the
stock
yard
company.
our
department,
as
a
matter
of
administration,
had
every
reason
to
believe
at
that
time
that
these
two
litigants
would
develop
the
facts
forthrightly
and
fully.
these
two
litigants,
if
your
honor
please,
are
very
substantial
corporate
entities.
the
producers
livestock
marketing
association
in
its
own
brief
here
today
describes
itself
as
a
public
utility
and
it
characterizes
the
stock
yard
company
also
as
a
public
utility.
both
of
these
litigants
have
had
experience
an
important
and
nature
litigation
under
the
packers
and
stockyards
act.
they
have
been
operating
at
that
stockyard
for
years
and
years,
both
the
stockyard
owner
and
the
producers
livestock
marketing
association.
when
our
department
received
this
complaint
by
this
market
agency
with
various
factual
allegations
as
to
conditions
and
circumstances
in
the
market
there
and
when
those
factual
circumstances
were
denied
by
the
stock
yard
company,
our
department
at
least
in
reason
and
we
had
no
reason
to
believe
otherwise,
thought
that
these
two
litigants
if
they
proceeded
with
the
case
would
develop
the
evidence
forthrightly
and
fully.
now,
this
practice
is
not
a
novelty
either
under
the
statute
or
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act.
title
iii
of
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
is
patterned
expressly
so
this
court
said
in
the
tarrant
case
in
280
u.s.
and
the
legislative
history
shows
it.
title
iii
of
the
packers
and
stockyards
act,
the
very
title
involved
here
today
is
adopted
almost
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
respect
to
their
jurisdiction
overrates
and
regulations.
the
practice
there
and
the
practice
before
our
own
agency
since
1921,
since
the
adoption
of
the
packers
and
stockyards
act,
has
been
that
in
some
situations,
we
would
allow
a
private
litigant
to
go
forward
with
his
own
complaint
either
with
respect
to
a
rate
that's
challenged
or
with
respect
to
a
regulation
that's
challenged.
may
i
say
again,
when
this
litigation
had
its
origin,
our
department
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
these
facts
would
be
developed.
and
as
i
said
earlier
in
my
remarks,
we
were
surprised
when
the
case
took
the
turn
that
it
did.
now,
if
you
suggest
--
now
i
don't
know
that
justice
frankfurter
suggested
it
but
let's
assume
it
for
a
moment.
if
you
suggest
that
at
the
time,
the
complainant
refused
to
--
refused
to
go
forward
with
the
presentation
of
evidence,
if
at
that
time
the
department
on
its
own
motion
had
issued
a
complaint,
no
doubt
these
books
and
records
would
again
have
been
sought
by
means
of
a
subpoena.
mr.
neil
brooks
yes,
i
know.
i
know.
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
brooks
well
--
mr.
neil
brooks
yes.
mr.
neil
brooks
we
have
a
main
section
of
our
brief
on
that
exact
point,
your
honor.
on
reversal,
and
i
believe
this
is
the
heading
of
that
section
in
our
brief,
on
reversal
of
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
department
will
then
be
free
to
take
whatever
action
is
appropriate
with
respect
to
these
regulations,
and
in
further
answer,
and
i
must
not
run
over
my
time
further,
the
department
at
times
is
the
complainant.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
brief
filed
of
the
producers
livestock
marketing
association
here
refers
to
a
situation
in
indianapolis
not
related
to
this
but
refers
to
a
situation
there
in
which
the
stockyard
owner
issued
some
regulations
and
the
department
itself
filed
the
complaint
and
it's
going
forward
with
that
proceeding.
within
the
limits
of
our
personnel
and
they
are
limited
of
course
in
this
broad
appeal
of
regulation,
our
department
proceeds
forthrightly
in
these
cases
as
best
we
can.
and
here,
at
the
time
the
administrative
decision
was
made,
there
was
ever
reason
to
believe
that
all
of
these
facts
would
be
developed.
