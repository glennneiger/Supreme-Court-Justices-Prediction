mr.
ashley
sellers
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
ashley
sellers
justice
please.
i'm
going
to
start
out
with
that
point.
it
is
true
the
court
below
looked
at
the
regulation
and
the
court
below
continued
to
look
at
the
regulation
and
screwing
its
eyes
solely
upon
the
words
of
the
regulation.
it
said
this
regulation
was
bad
and
therefore,
it
cannot
stand.
the
court
below
said
evidence
was
immaterial.
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
should
have,
without
holding
a
hearing,
without
looking
into
the
background
of
the
rule,
what
it
meant,
what
its
application
was,
found
on
its
face
the
regulation
was
unreasonable.
mr.
ashley
sellers
not
at
all.
mr.
ashley
sellers
not
at
all.
mr.
ashley
sellers
well,
that's
right.
with
the
regulation,
if
the
court
please,
there's
upon
market
agencies
and
dealers
operating
at
the
denver
stock
yard.
mr.
ashley
sellers
no.
mr.
ashley
sellers
that
is
territory
from
which
livestock
normally
comes
in
to
the
denver
market.
mr.
ashley
sellers
the
marketing
territory
includes
of
course
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
that's
right.
mr.
ashley
sellers
no.
he
said
the
denver
stock
yard,
if
the
court
please,
as
i
understood
him
to
say.
mr.
ashley
sellers
now,
the
market
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
no.
it
only
includes
in
the
area,
in
colorado
which
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
may
i
elaborate?
mr.
ashley
sellers
the
regulation
bears
upon
market
agencies.
it
does
not
bear
upon
farmers
or
shippers
to
the
market.
the
regulation
has
to
do
only
with
those
few
people.
by
saying
few,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
that
means
its
going
to
bear.
but
in
order
to
get
an
understanding
of
the
compass
of
the
rule
only
upon
those
people
firms
who
do
business
at
the
denver
market
as
agents,
as
people
operating
on
the
market
as
instrumentalities
or
if
you
please,
facilities
of
the
market.
a
stockyard
within
the
contemplation
of
the
act
and
as
it
has
gone
up,
consists
of
the
stock
yard
company
of
course
which
owns
the
facilities
and
which
performs
the
services
and
which
under
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
courts
is
a
business
affected
where
the
public
interest
--
public
interest
has
the
duty
to
provide
reasonable
stockyard
services
and
facilities
upon
reasonable
request.
itself
could
have
started
out
by
providing
the
buying
and
selling
of
services
itself.
in
some
stockyards,
that
is
the
situation.
in
other
stockyards,
there
are
agents
there
who
come
on
the
market,
who
have
to
register
with
the
department,
and
who
have
to
obtain
the
approval
of
the
stock
yard
company
in
order
to
do
business
at
that
yard.
now,
the
market
agencies
and
that's
the
case
here
is
involved
only
market
agencies,
market
agencies
has
facilities
or
instrumentalities
on
the
yard
are
themselves
public
utilities
within
the
language
of
these
cases.
they
too
have
the
obligation
to
render
reasonable
services
upon
reasonable
requests
without
discrimination.
the
marketing
agencies
at
denver
or
at
any
other
stockyard
have
as
their
initial
responsibility
so
provided
by
the
regulations
of
the
department
itself
to
render
it
--
the
--
render
their
primary
duties
to
the
consignors
to
the
market.
that
is
their
whole
reason
for
being
on
the
market
is
that
they
serve
that
market.
otherwise,
you
could
have,
well
have
situations
where
people
come
on
the
market.
they
come
registered
with
the
department
which
is
in
very
large
part
of
ministerial
act,
the
registration.
obtain
the
consent
of
the
stock
yard
company
to
operate
on
the
yard,
they
made
assignments
of
tents,
free
of
rental,
get
an
established
place
on
the
market,
there's
a
room
only
for
so
many,
10,
12,
15
at
denver
and
advertise
themselves
throughout
that
great
area
as
being
denver
market
agencies
but
set
themselves
to
taking
business
elsewhere
than
in
denver.
and
the
result
would
be
that
this
--
the
market
would
be
--
would
inevitably
decline
without
any
ability
to
help
itself
in
the
interest
of
the
patrons
both
the
buyers
and
sellers
of
the
market.
now,
the
stockyard
act,
the
whole
background
of
it
is
definitely
grounded
in
the
theory
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
farmers
and
the
producers
of
the
area
to
have
a
market,
a
central
market
such
as
this
great
stockyard
at
denver
is
which
would
provide
free
competition
in
the
bidding
and
the
sale
of
livestock
which
would
provide
an
ample
supply
or
different
kinds
of
livestock
at
all
times
to
suit
different
buying
demands
and
which
would
be
the
price
fixing
setting
mechanism
through
that
whole
marketing
area.
as
everyone
knows
in
the
industry,
prices
that
are
established
at
great
markets
like
chicago
and
omaha
and
denver
and
the
large
markets
have
a
tremendous
influence
over
the
transactions
of
livestock
made
locally
and
out
into
the
country.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
the
regulation
bore
only
upon
market
agencies.
the
regulation
does
not
say
to
any
farmer
or
any
producer
in
a
shipper
to
the
market
that
you
have
to
ship
to
denver.
the
regulation
does
not
say
to
any
farmer,
you
have
to
ship
all
of
your
livestock
or
none
to
do.
the
regulation
only
bears
upon
market
agencies.
it
in
effect
is
telling
to
market
agencies,
“it
is
your
primary
job
made
so
not
by
us
but
by
the
statute
and
by
that
regulation
to
the
department.
it
is
your
primary
job
to
serve
this
market
and
--
and
if
you
devote
your
energies
elsewhere
than
at
this
market
then
other
market
agencies
who
could
--
who
could
better
serve
this
market
in
the
interest
of
the
market
as
a
whole
should
take
your
place”.
mr.
ashley
sellers
no.
mr.
ashley
sellers
this
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
that's
right.
if
regulation
does
limit,
their
activities
are
to
roam
around
and
buy
and
sell
and
trade
any
livestock.
mr.
ashley
sellers
if
the
court
please,
the
regulation
or
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
you
may
only
do
business
at
one
market
neither
does
this
stockyard
regulation
say
that
you
may
only
do
business
at
one
market.
it
says
that
as
far
as
denver
is
concerned
and
that's
all
that
the
denver
stock
yards
could
do
that
you
should
in
operating
as
a
market
agency
at
this
yard,
give
certain
of
your
functions,
certain
of
your
activities
to
the
service
of
this
market.
otherwise,
there's
no
reason
for
you
being
here.
now
it
could
well
be,
although,
again
if
the
court
please,
there
is
not
one
ounce
of
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
what
the
regulation
means,
as
to
what
its
impact
is,
as
to
how
many
other
markets
there
are,
as
to
how
many
agencies
there
are,
as
to
what
sort
of
organization
that
producers
marketing
association
is,
we
don't
know
what
they
are
of
this
record.
mr.
ashley
sellers
it
does.
mr.
ashley
sellers
to
the
extent
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
may
i
say
that
this
is
only
one
regulation.
there
is
a
great
body
of
stockyard
regulations,
not
merely
at
denver
but
stock
yard
companies
all
over
the
country
have
regulations.
many
of
those
regulations
impose
limitations
upon
the
freedom
of
action
of
market
agencies.
it's
--
as
this
court
said
in
the
board
of
trade
case,
every
regulation
restrains
to
a
certain
extent
that
is
true
of
practically
of
a
regulation
i
can
conceive
of
not
only
of
the
stock
yard
company
but
of
--
almost
in
the
other
utilities.
mr.
ashley
sellers
the
--
the
regulation
says
that
you
can
undertake
to
solicit
sitting
on
the
denver
market
and
setting
yourself
out
as
a
market
agency
to
serve
this
market.
you
can't
reach
out
to
solicit
to
take
business
away
from
this
market.
you
can't
--
you
can't
expect
yourself
to
diverting
the
flow
of
livestock
that
normally
would
not.
it
is
your
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
it
should
not.
but
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
no.
mr.
ashley
sellers
if
the
court
please.
the
stockyard
service
is
not
rendered
to
the
market
agency.
mr.
ashley
sellers
the
market
agencies
are
merely
agencies
not
--
not
marketing
agencies
generally.
they're
not
simply
businessmen
operating
buying
and
selling
and
trading
in
livestock.
they
are
--
they
are
definite
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
oh,
yes.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashley
sellers
the
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
the
respondent
here,
the
producers
livestock
marketing
association
is
a
market
agency.
if
under
the
statute
just
like
the
stock
yard
company
by
that
very
language
we
just
read
has
a
duty
to
render
reasonable
stockyard
services
if
you
please
and
that's
a
strange
terminology
that
a
market
agency
would
have
the
responsibility
to
have
to
render
stockyard
services
but
that's
the
language
of
the
statute.
so
that
the
two,
both
the
stock
yard
company
and
the
market
agencies
are
under
the
same
statutory
duty
to
render
stockyard
services
to
patrons
of
that
market.
now,
again,
if
i
can
say
so
without
the
fear
of
repetition,
the
market
agencies
are
not
the
patrons
of
the
yard.
they
are
not
the
farmers
who
shipped
the
livestock
to
the
market.
mr.
ashley
sellers
they
are
simply
people
operating
on
the
market.
mr.
ashley
sellers
they
are
the
market
agency
operating
on
this
market.
mr.
ashley
sellers
they
are
opposed
to
it
because
they
want
--
if
the
court
please,
i
--
i
can't
talk
without
getting
off
the
record.
there's
no
record
here
at
all.
mr.
ashley
sellers
all
that
we
have
here
is
a
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
if
--
if
it
is
true
that
under
this
regulation
that
they
have
--
they
are
soliciting
business,
the
people
operating
--
the
personnel
operating
--
representing
this
agency
at
denver
is
soliciting
business
in
that
area
for
other
stockyards
or
for
other
markets
then
the
wording
of
the
regulation
would
certainly
seem
to
say
that
that's
what
they
could
not
do.
mr.
ashley
sellers
well,
the
case
came
before
the
court
as
i
said
without
any
evidence
whatsoever.
all
we
have
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
the
responsibility
is
upon
the
respondent
here.
they
filed
a
complaint
in
the
administrative
proceeding
alleging
that
the
regulation
was
invalid.
mr.
ashley
sellers
no.
there
(voice
overlap)
no,
not
in
their
complaint.
mr.
ashley
sellers
well,
that's
right.
but
before
you
get
to
that
if
the
court
please,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
regulation
was
invalid.
we
filed
an
answer
in
which
we
denied
the
allegations
of
their
complaint,
all
factual
allegations
except
the
mere
fact
that
the
--
that
there
were
--
there
were
two
people
involved
and
that
there
was
a
regulation.
mr.
ashley
sellers
we
--
we
denied
that
the
regulation
had
the
meaning
that
they
attributed
to
it,
and
we
put
the
matter
into
issue
for
a
hearing
as
to
what
the
regulation
would
mean.
in
preparation
for
the
hearing,
we
filed
an
application
for
a
subpoena
to
get
certain
records
and
books
that
they
have
which
would
demonstrate
the
unreasonableness
of
their
conduct
and
their
failure
themselves
to
render
reasonable
stockyard
services
and
which
in
turn
made
it
necessary
for
us
to
have
such
a
regulation.
at
that
point,
they
did
not
as
we
--
as
we've
said
before
challenge
the
subpoena
in
terms
of
its
propriety.
they
simply
answered
by
saying
the
subpoena
should
not
issue
because
the
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face.
that
would
have
not
been
their
reply
to
the
complaint.
it
was
only
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
at
that
point,
after
oral
argument
on
that
feature
as
to
whether
the
--
the
subpoena
should
--
should
issue
with
that
type
of
response,
the
examiner
held
that
a
hearing
was
necessary
in
order
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
that
he
deemed
that
a
subpoena
should
--
should
issue
but
that
he
would
await
until
the
complainants
have
made
out
a
prima
facie
case.
he
expected
them
to
put
on
evidence.
he
set
it
down
for
hearing.
thereupon,
they
filed
a
document
entitled
an
election
to
rest
in
which
they
said,
“we
will
not
put
on
evidence.
we
will
not
attend
the
hearing
in
january
the
24th
that
they
set
or
at
any
other
time
and
we
stand
on
the
proposition
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face.”
the
stock
yard
company
at
that
point
moved
to
dismiss
the
proceeding
because
of
the
failure
of
the
complainant
to
prosecute
its
case.
these
were
the
only
two
parties
involved.
i
was
--
it
was
their
task.
they
had
the
burden
of
proof.
admittedly,
under
the
law
and
under
the
rules
of
the
department
and
they
had
failed
to
go
forward
with
the
evidence
to
even
put
on
any
evidence
whatsoever,
so
we
moved
to
dismiss.
and
that
gave
rise
to
the
decision
of
the
judicial
officer
who
residing
those
facts
said
that
the
issue
before
me
is
whether
the
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face,
is
evidence
needed
in
order
to
determine
the
issue.
he
also
then
said
my
conclusion
about
dismissing
the
case
because
he
found
that
the
regulation
was
not
invalid
on
its
face
that
it
needed
evidence.
he
--
he
greatly
explored
the
different
areas
in
which
--
of
their
attack.
they
attacked
it
on
the
basis
of
the
public
utilities
obligation
and
of
our
obligation
under
the
antitrust
laws.
he
explored
all
of
those
features
holding
that
in
any
event
that
evidence
was
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
evidence
--
whether
the
regulation
was
involved
--
invalid
on
its
face.
and
he
said,
“my
conclusion
is
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
the
specs
upon
which
i
may
act
gives
to
the
respondent
in
a
proceeding,
the
right
to
a
full
hearing
and
upon
the
basis
of
that
procedural
right
which
this
court
as
he
adverted
to
time
and
again
has
upheld
the
famous
morgan
cases,
the
comparable
cases
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
a
counterpart
to
this
statute.
he
held
that
i
--
that
the
regulation
should
--
should
go
to
hearing
and
since
they
had
refused
to
go
to
hearing,
he
said
i
have
no
choice
but
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
ashley
sellers
precisely.
mr.
ashley
sellers
let's
assume,
if
the
court
please,
that
evidence
would
show
that
the
impact
of
this
regulation
is
actually
to
foster
competition
at
the
denver
market.
let's
assume
that
that's
the
case.
mr.
ashley
sellers
it
could
well
do
that.
mr.
ashley
sellers
well,
we
are
not
a
marketing
remarkable
agency.
we're
a
stockyard
--
mr.
ashley
sellers
well
but
they
are
subject
to
the
statutes
just
as
we
are
in
the
same
obligation.
mr.
ashley
sellers
you
said
it
much
more
precisely
than
i've
tried
to
say
it
for
15
to
20
minutes.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes.
mr.
ashley
sellers
no.
mr.
ashley
sellers
not
a
license.
it's
a
mere
registration.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashley
sellers
that's
right.
mr.
ashley
sellers
well,
it's
more
than
that.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes.
mr.
ashley
sellers
he
may
act
--
he
acts
as
a
commission
basis.
mr.
ashley
sellers
they
are.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashley
sellers
that's
right,
sir,
precisely.
mr.
ashley
sellers
precisely.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashley
sellers
yes.
mr.
ashley
sellers
that's
cited
in
--
in
the
--
i
believe
it's
in
--
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief.
there's
one
like
this
at
los
angeles.
there's
one
like
this
at
baltimore.
there's
one
like
this
at
san
antonio,
i
believe.
there
are
