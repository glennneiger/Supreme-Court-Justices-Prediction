justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
sellers,
before
we
begin,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
evidently
see
this
(inaudible)
appears
to
me,
not
that
i'm
saying
the
court
below
was
right
but
it
seems
to
me
is
very
simple
on
what
it
is.
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
abstract
to
(inaudible)
what
they
found
was
the
statute
that
has
one
special
provision
which
said
it
shall
be
(inaudible)
of
every
stockyard
owners
and
market
agents
that
have
furnished
a
reasonable
repair
without
discrimination,
reasonable
stockyard
services
that's
been
stopped.
i
understand
what
the
court
then
said
was
that
it
found
that
the
denver
yard
have
refused
to
render
to
every
stockyard
(inaudible)
services
of
unreasonable
repairs.
that
it
said
that
the
stockyard
had
imposed
condition
which
attempted
to
control
the
other
business
activity
of
those
who
dealt
with
them.
the
court
may
have
been
wrong
but
it
held,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
nothing
could
take
evidence
on
in
that
field
that
if
the
denver
--
the
denver
agency
absolutely
barred
the
--
any
regulation
which
would
prohibit
people
from
doing
business
with
them,
anyone
of
them,
on
equal
terms
with
others
and
there's
nothing
for
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
determine.
i
would
like
you
before
you
get
through
the
discussion
on
that
basis.
i
don't
quite
--
it
seems
--
i
may
not
understand
it
but
it
seems
to
me
like
that's
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
construe
that
regulation
of
the
board
as
telling
people
to
do
business
with
denver
that
you
can't
do
business
with
others
unless
you
agree
not
to
solicit
for
any
other
agencies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
to
have
any
transactions
with
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
dispute
with
the
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
doesn't
settle
the
question,
does
it?
may
i
ask
you
if
this
is
it
as
you
will
get
to
the
part
of
the
statute
which
made
all
i
know
be
wholly
inadequate
to
support
the
court's
judgment?
what
you
have
is
a
regulation
of
the
denver
stock
yard,
and
if
it
can
make
it
every
other
every
other
one,
you'd
make
it,
which
tells
all
these
market
agencies
to
do
business,
that
you
can't
do
any
business
if
you
solicit
for
any
other
agents
or
any
other
--
other
place,
if
you
--
in
manner
divert
or
attempt
to
divert
livestock
in
this
market
even
yours
which
would
otherwise
normally
come
to
the
stockyard.
now,
therefore,
you
have
a
regulation
which
cuts
off
that
freedom
to
get
stockyard
service
it
rendered,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
produces
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
market.
i
agree
with
you
over
that.
but
what
you
have
is
--
is
a
statute
which
has
given
broad
power
to
regulate
in
certain
a
expense
are
the
markets
themselves
and
with
the
secretary
in
the
counsel's
brief,
but
it
has
this
section
may
or
may
not
control
and
may
or
may
not
justify
what
the
court
said.
it
should
be
the
duty
of
every
stockyard
owner.
this
is
a
stockyard
owned
business
in
denver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
market
agents,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
furnish
upon
reasonable
request
without
discrimination,
reasonable
stockyard
service
at
such
time.
now
suppose
the
stockyard
service
they
want
and
for
purpose
of
reason
for
the
amount
of
cattle
they
want,
pleaded
and
process
there
and
willing
to
pay
the
price
but
the
man
comes
in
and
says,
“the
company
comes
in
with
a
regulation
decision.”
you
can't
do
business
with
us
because
you've
been
soliciting
business
on
those
markets.
we
don't
--
you
--
you
can't
do
business
with
us
if
you
do
that.
for
selling
outside
these
stores,
you've
attempted
to
divert
business
from
this
agency
to
go
to
utah
or
to
los
angeles.
why
does
this
--
why
does
that
not
deny
them
that
full
service
which
the
provision
of
the
statute
on
which
the
court
relies
said
they
must
have
free
at
each
market?
is
it
in
the
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
i've
read
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
this
utah
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
are
they
opposing
to
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
cannot.
people
that
want
to
do
business
with
them
and
with
the
denver
stock
yard
and
want
to
solicit
customers
for
them
can't
do
it,
if
this
regulation
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
problem
i
have
is
this.
it
maybe
the
act
for
instance
in
certain
way,
the
secretary
can
with
evidence
being
introduced,
permit
the
local
places
like
denver
and
utah
to
say
that
we're
not
going
to
have
anybody.
we
won't
have
the
business
with
denver
agencies.
we're
not
going
to
let
you
have
anything
to
do,
maybe
it
does.
but
what
i'm
interested
in
is
why
does
this
section
on
which
the
court
relied
not
permitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
its
face?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
the
court
decided
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
would
you
mind
telling
us,
if
you
don't
mind,
why
does
anything
there
for
anybody
to
decide
if
this
means
what
the
court
said
that
they
must
not
restrain
the
freedom
of
the
people
to
come
in
to
that
market
agent
and
do
business,
when
it's
conceivable
and
has
to
be
conceded
that
the
regulation
does
in
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
it
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
to
deny
them
service,
it's
their
duty
to
furnish
upon
reasonable
request
without
discrimination,
reasonable
stockyard
services.
now,
if
that
doesn't
mean
that
there's
nothing
left
for
the
agency
there,
what
does
it
mean?
it
can
--
can
every
marketing
agent
in
the
united
states
issue
regulations
controlling
the
amount
in
which
those
who
do
business
with
them
--
will
do
business
with
other
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
are
you
going
to
argue
on
the
stockyard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
if
(voice

but
they
haven't
passed
any
regulation
yet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
tried
to
deny
to
certain
people
the
right
to
get
stockyard
services
from
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
you
or
someone
else
before
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
certainty
about
what
they
mean
by
normal
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
describe
it
by
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
can
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
a
surveyor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
ambiguous
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
definition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
are
these
judges
on
that
decided
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
ex-governor
of
kansas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
judge
pickett.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
explaining
the
technique
of
how
you
do
your
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
travel
around
over
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
--
does
everything
that
you
buy
go
to
the
stockyard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
some
places
where
they're
reasonably
close
to
one
--
more
than
one
stockyard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it's
not
any
along
close
to
the
dividing
line,
what
is
the
quarrel
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
that's
ordinarily
done,
is
there
a
dispute
over
to
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
him
a
question
after
the
time
