be
persecuted,
people
who
were

justice

that
in
the

l.
black

outside

can
you
think
of
any
reasons
why
those
who
were
interested,
peculiarly
humanitarian
reasons,
would
have
wanted
to
permit
aliens
who
were
here
even
out
on
parole
to
be
sent
back
or
intended
to
be
persecuted
particularly
because
of
the
technical
status
which
they
occupy
(inaudible)
as
merely
on
parole?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
think
of
any
reasons
why
the
same
humanitarian
reasons
were
not
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
indicating
what
they
are?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
in
the
opinion
of
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
chong
case
that
this
footnote
to
this
effect
(inaudible)
says
that
1964
--
1950,
amending
156
here
as
it
referred
to
the
amendment
number
20.
it
was
enacted
after
the
administrative
determination
that
these
cases
had
been
reached.did
that
have
any
connection
to
this,
why
this
amendment
was
put
in
--
after
the
board
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
are
designed
to
admit
these
people
after
they
had
declined
to
--
to
consider
and
give
them
consideration
about
the
expense
deported
to
another
country.
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
argued
at
that
time
that
the
--
the
man
who
was
out
on
bond
that
these
people
are,
did
not
get
the
advantage
of
--
of
being
kept
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
held
to
the
contrary
putting
which
interest
is
on
the
words
needed.
