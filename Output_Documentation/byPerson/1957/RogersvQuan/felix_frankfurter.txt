frankfurter
what
immediately?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
scope
do
you
get?
what
are
the
--
what
is
the
immediate
problem
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
land
border
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
do
you
happen
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
not
only
have
power
but
you're
doing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
contemplate
people
sneaking
in,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do
--
they
do
sneak
in
and
people
violate
laws,
people
violate
laws
but
you
don't
construe
it
all
on
the
assumption
that
law
--
in
the
assumption
that
violation
of
law
to
the
normal
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
happened
to
know
approximately
how
many
lawfully
--
no,
how
many
alien,
resident
aliens
there
were
in
the
united
states
or
known
to
have
been
in
the
united
states
approximately
in
1950?
do
you
happen
to
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
what
magnitude
they
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
--
probably
to
the
millions,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
just
want
to
know
how
many
resident
aliens
there
were
about
1950,
potentially
would
come
under
347
(a).
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
he
take
it
out
of
the
case
even
narrow
--
he'd
be
strongly
tempted
not
to
have
his
hands
tied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
--
i
thought
one
of
the
most
important
consideration
in
construing
a
statute
is
to
contemplate
the
consequences,
a
one
construction
rather
than
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
certainly
was
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
deterrent.
this
isn't
a
question
of
deterrent.
it's
a
question
of
relevance
of
argument
and
an
argument
maybe
irrelevant
or
tenures
in
one
situation
and
power
from
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
you
state
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
as
you
stated
in
an
individual
case,
but
general
tendency,
general
occurrence
of
it,
legislation,
general
occurrence
that's
brought
on
their
heels
of
the
most
powerful
considerations
in
the
conduct
of
cabinet
officers
and
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
was
your
arguments
extend
to
applying
the
statue
to
people
in
detention
centers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
that
if
we're
going
to
sit
here
as
party
under
the
tree
and
does
follow
my
own
strong
feeling,
that
strong
feeling
that
goes
to
the
root
as
much
of
this
strictly.
if
i
follow
those
feelings,
i
wouldn't
be
very
comfortable
to
say
that
a
fellow
who
is
paroled
is
within
the
merciful
statute,
but
the
people
in
the
detention
aren't
because
of
that
what
you
call
as
those
supple
distinction.
you
--
if
we
are
to
discard
all,
the
whole
pushing
momentum
of
immigration
laws
in
construction
not
for
discarding
it,
not
making
these
distinctions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
dream
of
discarding
because
i
have
a
limited
function
and
congress
has
another
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
i
don't
like
statutes
and
i
don't
like
constructions
by
the
attorney
general
and
i
don't
like
actions
by
many
branch
of
the
government
doesn't
set
me
above
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
about
dissenting
opinions
are
not
the
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
--
but
you
must
be
concerned
if
you
ask
this
court
to
construe
a
statute
and
to
see
its
implications
and
to
see
what
kind
of
harming
there
is
or
isn't
with
the
past.
you
can't
pick
and
choose
and
ask
this
court
to
construe
the
statute
just
to
take
care
of
your
own
particular
case.
i
do
not
call
that
law
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
go
back
to
your
reference
to
the
legislative
history.
you
said
something
about
a
bill,
the
original
bill
that
senator
graham
termed
as
book
of
resident
aliens,
where
is
that
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
used
that
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
didn't
you
use
the
word
resident
aliens?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
it
was
senator
graham's
amendment
to
that
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
his
amendment
was
--
was
in
conjunction
with
the
hobbs
bill,
to
those
and
his
proposal
was
related
to
the
hobbs
bill,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
a
separate
chapter
as
i
remember
of
the
internal
security.
