mr.
david
carliner
solicitor
general
made
for
the
first
time
in
this
court.
it
had
been
the
position
consistently
of
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
there
was
no
power
in
the
hands
of
the
attorney
general
to
withhold
the
deportation
of
an
alien
to
a
country
in
which
he
would
be
physically
prosecuted
because
he
had
no
statutory
power
for
it.
today
in
this
court,
he
concedes
that
he
can
keep
an
alien
in
the
united
states
and
whether
he's
physically
in
the
united
states,
i
put
to
decide
for
the
moment,
but
he
concedes
that
he
does
have
the
power
to
say
it
excluded
aliens
from
deportation.
he
says
that
he
has
it
under
the
provisions
of
section
212
(d)
(5)
of
the
statute,
namely
the
parole
provisions
of
the
statute.
in
his
brief,
he
also
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
may
have
it
but
he
does
not
specifically
and
explicitly
say
he
has
it,
but
on
page
26
at
the
footnote
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
solicitor
general
refers
to
section
237
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
gives
to
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
say
the
deportation
of
an
excluded
alien
where
it
is
practicable
or
proper.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
attorney
general
has
drafted
regulations
which
give
the
district
directors
of
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
authority.
so
actually,
this
is
not
an
enormous
case
at
all
at
this
point.
all
it
is
as
a
--
as
a
determination
of
what
technical
basis
the
attorney
general
must
seek
out
in
order
to
justify
withholding
deportation
of
an
excluded
alien
to
a
country
in
which
he
shall
be
physically
persecuted.
that
of
course
is
nevertheless
an
important
question,
but
we
believe
that
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
the
problem
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
particularly
has
been
concerned
with
out
of
this
case
if
the
attorney
general
has
the
power.
i
suggest
to
even
further
--
mr.
david
carliner
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
government's
attorney
has
indicated
that
his
policies
may
change
if
this
court
renders
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
petition
--
petitioner.
it's
an
impermissible
argument
that
he
may
make
it
but
it's
an
impermissible
consideration
for
the
court
that
hold
the
kind
of
(inaudible)
sword
over
the
court.
mr.
david
carliner
i
think
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct.
i
believe
that
it
maybe
helpful
to
your
honor
if
your
honor
will
recall
the
argument
that
was
made
to
this
court
in
the
case
of
tom
lee
shang
which
the
counsel
for
the
government
adverted
to.
there,
it
was
said
that
habeas
corpus
was
the
only
remedy
which
an
excluded
alien
could
have
enough
declaratory
judgment
and
if
this
court
decided
adversely
to
the
government
and
granted
the
alien
declaratory
judgment
as
a
remedy,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
keeping
all
excluded
aliens
in
detention
at
the
threshold
of
united
states
that
none
of
them
would
be
released
to
--
in
the
bounds
of
this
country,
because
if
they
were
released
within
the
bounds
of
this
country,
they
would
have
a
privilege
which
they
did
not
previously
have,
namely
the
right
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
that
argument
did
not
deter
this
court
as
i
recall
as
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
david
carliner
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
it
did
not
deter
to
the
majority
of
this
court
from
holding
a
declaratory
judgment
action
was
available
to
an
excluded
alien.
mr.
david
carliner
well,
i
suggest
with
humility,
your
honor
that
it
is
an
irrelevant
argument
because
i
suspect
that
no
one
will
believe
that
the
attorney
general
will
refuse
to
parole
aliens
into
the
united
states
merely
because
the
possibility
may
arise
that
that
alien,
in
some
time
in
the
future,
may
request
to
stay
of
deportation
to
a
particular
country
upon
the
ground
that
if
he
is
deported
to
that
country,
he
will
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
mr.
david
carliner
sir?
mr.
david
carliner
well,
it
maybe
your
honor
and
it
maybe
that
if
this
court
feels
that
the
--
a
--
a
speculation
as
to
the
future
conduct
of
the
attorney
general
is
a
relevant
consideration,
all
that
i
can
do
is
to
submit
for
our
part
that
it
is
speculative
as
to
what
the
attorney
general
looked
to
and
that
at
--
for
our
part,
i
suggest
respectfully,
that
it
does
imply
a
proper
consideration
in
the
case.
well,
i
believe
that
the
matter
can
be
disposed
of
upon
much
narrower
grounds.
the
most
fundamental
problem
it
seems
to
be
with
which
the
court
is
concerned
is
the
thrust
which
a
determination
that
these
aliens
are
within
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
the
243
(h)
would
have
upon
the
historic
and
well
settled
distinctions
between
exclusion
and
deportation
and
upon
the
reading
of
an
opinion
based
on
that
concept
and
upon
granting
the
petitioner's
--
upon
granting
the
respondents
upholding
the
decision
below
on
the
impact
it
may
have
upon
historic
decisions
of
the
ekiu
decision
and
ju
toy.
i
believe
that
the
suggestion
that
was
made
earlier
in
argument
that
the
phrase
in
the
united
states
with
which
we
are
concerned
with
here
has
been
one
which
has
been
finally
decided
and
actually
decided
by
courts
in
previous
decision
is
an
erroneous
one.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
indicated
as
regard
to
kaplan
against
tod,
the
specific
question,
two
questions
there
were
these,
one,
whether
a
person
was
dwelling
in
the
united
states
so
as
to
become
a
naturalized
citizen.
well,
we
do
not
contend
that
these
petitioners
here
or
i
mean
these
respondents
here
are
dwelling
within
the
united
states.
all
they
need
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
in
the
united
states.
now,
the
second
question
in
kaplan
against
tod
was
whether
they
were
--
and
mr.
sand
pointed
this
out
to
the
court
was
whether
they
were
found
within
united
states
in
the
violation
of
the
immigrant
authority.
that
is
verbatim
from
the
kaplan
against
tod
decision,
and
also
whether
they
had
entered
the
united
states
in
violation
of
the
immigrant
authorities.
well,
no
contention
is
made
here
that
these
aliens
have
entered
the
united
states.
this
court
has
the
problem
of
entry
now
before
in
the
bonetti
case
and
i
can
see
that
the
word
entry
is
a
word
of
art
which
must
be
construed
within
the
meaning
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
indeed
it
is
defined
in
the
definition
section
of
the
act.
we
do
not
contend
that
these
aliens
have
entered
in
the
united
states.
we
don't
contend
either
that
they
have
been
found
in
the
united
states
in
violation
of
the
immigrant
authorities.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
been
permitted
to
come
into
the
united
states
with
the
expressed
consent
of
the
immigrant
authorities.
so,
whatever
kaplan
v.
tod
may
hold,
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
determine
a
statutory
construction,
a
definition,
an
interpretation
of
the
phrase
in
this
statute
in
the
united
states.
now,
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
earlier
decisions,
ekiu,
ju
toy
and
other
later
decisions
let's
say
among
others.
now,
those
questions
your
honor
i
believe
are
far
more
difficult,
but
they
too
are
distinguishable
from
the
ones
here.
in
the
ekiu
case,
the
court
specifically
held
that
an
alien
who
had
been
removed
from
his
vessel,
but
who
was
detained
at
a
mission
house
had
not
landed
in
the
united
states.
and
it
was
upon
the
basis
of
the
immigration
statute
in
effect
in
1892
that
such
removal
shall
not
constitute
a
landing
that
the
court
held
that
the
fact
that
the
alien
geographically
was
in
a
mission
house
in
the
state
of
washington,
oregon
did
not
placed
her
within
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause.
now,
that
latter
clause
raises
another
--
creates
another
problem.
i'm
of
course
conscious
to
the
fact
that
the
court
is
going
to
avoid
constitutional
considerations.
there
are
no
constitutional
considerations
here.
it
maybe
one
thing
to
hold
that
an
alien
is
in
the
united
states
when
he/she
has
been
excluded
for
the
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause,
but
it's
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
she
is
in
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
a
very
specific
statute.
only
yesterday,
this
court
held
in
perez
against
--
the
united
states
against
perez
that
in
construing
a
question
of
venue,
whether
a
seaman
who
had
been
amended
in
the
united
states,
but
not
admitted
to
the
united
states,
that
distinction
is
important
that
an
alien
who
had
been
--
a
seaman
who
had
been
landed
in
the
united
states
could
be
prosecuted
in
any
district
where
he
had
remained
in
this
country.
the
court
said
the
word
remains
permits
no
connotation
other
than
continuing
presence.
i
suggest
your
honors
that
the
word
in
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
our
argument,
permits
no
connotation
other
than
being
in
the
united
states
that
the
distinction
which
the
government
itself
has
recognized
innumerably
--
innumerable
times.
the
case
of
ju
singh
for
example
which
was
before
this
court
once
and
was
vacated
because
of
mootness.
it
was
made
moot
because
that
alien
and
this
is
an
anomalous
situation,
which
i
think
the
court
should
recall,
who
had
been
excluded
from
the
united
states,
as
an
alien
who
could
not
be
permitted
to
be
admitted
to
this
country
was
paroled
into
the
united
states
for
the
specific
purpose
of
being
naturalized
as
an
american
citizen
and
the
case
was
mooted
because
being
a
united
states
citizen,
he
cannot
be
deported
as
an
alien
and
certainly
cannot
be
deported
to
china.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
only
last
fall,
in
public
law
85-316
in
various
amendments
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
provided
that
aliens
who
are
paroled
into
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
under
the
provisions
of
section
212
(d)
(5)
of
the
law
could
be
adopted
by
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
provided
they
were
orphans.
now
obviously,
this
court
is
aware
that
in
many
states,
you
cannot
be
adopted
as
an
orphan
unless
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
orphan
himself
and
in
order
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
orphan
himself,
you
must
have
a
residence
in
the
state
of
that
court's
jurisdiction.
so,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
recognized
that
persons
who
had
been
paroled
into
the
united
states
may
be
physically
in
the
united
states.
so
i
believe
that
the
question
is
that
narrow
whether
that
naked
narrow
phrase
in
the
united
states
in
the
--
this
particular
statute
gives
the
alien
presence
in
this
country
for
the
sole
purpose
of
being
saved
from
deportation,
not
to
any
country.
he
could
be
deported
to
hong
kong
we
believe.
he
could
be
deported
to
formosa.
he
could
be
deported
to
any
other
country
in
the
world
which
would
take
him,
but
he
could
not
be
deported
to
a
country
in
which
he
will
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
i
believe
that
the
court
approaches
the
issue
in
that
light.
it
can
avoid
the
difficult
problems
which
the
ekiu
case
and
all
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
the
historic
distinction
between
exclusion
and
deportation,
it
can
avoid
those
problems
and
there's
no
reason,
i
believe,
that
before
this
case
with
those
questions.
now,
the
second
issue
--
mr.
david
carliner
well
reluctantly,
i
must
say
your
honor
that
we
have
a
distinction
between
people
who
are
in
detention
centers.
if
the
court
is
going
to
say
that
people
who
are
in
detention
centers
or
in
the
united
states,
i
believe
would
have
to
disavow
or
distinguish
language
which
appeared
certainly
recently
in
the
mitzi
case,
because
the
court
has
held
and
more
than
that,
the
statute
itself
has
held,
provides
that
persons
who
have
been
removed
from
their
ships
and
who
are
confined
to
detention
centers
shall
not
be
considered
to
have
landed
in
the
united
states
and
i
would
have
to
concede
that
a
person
who
has
not
landed
in
the
united
states
under
the
historic
decisions
of
this
court
is
not
within
the
united
states.
as
to
our
case,
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
these
aliens
are
not
in
detention
centers.
they
have
been
paroled
into
the
united
states
and
i
should
note
in
passing
that
they
have
not
been
paroled
merely
to
the
city
of
new
york
or
to
san
francisco
but
they
live
wherever
they
will
in
the
country.
there
is
no
requirement
upon
them
as
to
where
they
shall
live,
only
that
they
shall
give
notice
as
to
where
they
move.
mr.
david
carliner
well,
i
couldn't
agree
more
with
your
honor
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
noticed,
observed
in
his
footnote
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
the
ekiu
decision
should
put
it
that
strongly,
but
that
the
distinctions
between
deportation
and
exclusion
are
not
as
strong
as
they
were
when
the
ekiu
case
was
decided
in
1892
and
if
mr.
justice
frankfurter
appeals
and
held
to
the
start
--
to
discard
those
distinctions
--
mr.
david
carliner
also
--
mr.
david
carliner
well,
there
is
respectable
authority
at
the
time
of
those
original
decisions.
there
were
strong
dissenting
opinions
which
indicated
--
mr.
david
carliner
in
any
event,
for
purposes
of
our
particular
case,
an
alien
who
is
in
detention
is
--
is
not
--
we're
not
concerned
with
him.
this
alien
has
--
mr.
david
carliner
well,
i
ask
this
court
only
to
look
at
the
statute
in
question.
now,
the
statute
in
question
at
section
233
provides
that
an
alien
who
has
been
removed
from
his
vessel
upon
which
he
arrived
in
the
united
states
and
is
in
detention
at
this
port
of
entry
cannot
be
considered
to
have
landed
in
the
united
states.
this
court
has
consistently
upheld
that
kind
of
statute
against
the
challenge
that
it
violated
in
certain
instances,
due
process
rights
which
persons
have
in
this
country.
now,
the
court
wishes
to
adhere
to
that
and
i'm
not
asking
today
that
the
court
overrule
that
distinction.
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
adhere
to
that,
it
does
not
affect
the
aliens
in
this
case.
it
does
not
affect
jimmy
kuan
or
the
other
aliens
because
they
are
not
in
detention.
the
attorney
general
has
specifically
paroled
him
into
the
united
states.
now,
i
come
to
another
question,
to
the
same
question,
but
to
another
aspect
of
it
in
order
to
establish
that
what
the
government
contends
is
not
matched
by
its
proof.
the
government
says
in
section
212
(d)
(5)
and
it
said
this
i
believe
in
(inaudible),
“it
does
not
change
his
status
in
the
united
states.”
all
that
section
212
(d)
(5)
says,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
such
parole
of
such
alien
shall
not
be
regarded
as
an
admission
of
the
alien
and
when
the
purposes
of
such
parole
have
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
been
served,
the
alien
shall
forthwith
return
or
be
returned
from
the
custody
from
which
he
has
--
was
paroled,
and
thereafter,
his
case
shall
be
continued
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
any
other
applicant
for
admission.
the
significant
word
in
that
clause
is
admission
to
the
united
states.
now,
the
government
has
not
discussed
that
at
all,
either
in
its
brief
or
in
its
oral
argument.
admission
is
a
--
is
a
precise
word
of
art
in
the
statute
because
it
is
defined
both
in
the
definitions
that
at
section
211
of
the
statute,
the
immigration
law
provides
specifically
no
immigrant
shall
be
admitted
into
the
united
states
unless
at
the
time
of
his
applications
for
admission,
he
possesses
certain
requisites,
a
valid,
unexpired
immigration
visa
and
various
other
things.
all
the
212
(d)
(5)
therefore
says
is
that
an
alien
who
has
been
paroled
in
has
not
been
admitted
to
the
united
states.
it
in
no
sense
provides
that
an
alien
who
has
been
paroled
into
this
country
is
not
in
this
--
in
this
united
states.
further
in
this,
i
believe
it's
significant
to
point
out
that
the
government
recounts
the
legislative
history
and
what
it
asks
for
in
obtaining
the
--
the
enactment
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
what
it
asked
for
and
it's
set
forth
in
its
reply
brief
and
it
said
--
is
that
general
power
to
parole
shall
be
granted
apart
from
the
emergent
medical
reasons
but
for
any
reasons
in
the
public
interest
or
any
emergent
reasons.
and
it
provided
that
whenever
the
attorney
general
into
his
discretion
concludes
the
deportation
of
any
alien
paroled
under
this
subsection
is
practicable
or
proper,
that
the
alien
shall
be
immediately
taken
into
custody
under
the
outstanding
order
of
exclusion
and
deportation
and
shall
be
deported
without
further
hearing
in
the
same
manner
as
other
aliens
who
were
excluded
from
the
united
states.
now,
that
is
not
at
all
what
congress
enacted.
it
not
only
did
not
enact
this
in
section
237,
but
at
section
212
(d)
(5),
they
changed
what
it
had
originally.
and
its
original
version
at
senate
bill
716,
it
provided
that
after
parole
had
been
revoked
that
the
alien
shall
be
deported
in
the
same
manner
as
other
aliens
who
were
excluded
from
the
united
states.
what
it
provided
for
was
that
they
shall
continue
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
applicant
for
admission
to
the
united
states.
now
there
again,
that
clause
is
not
equivalent
to
the
statement
that
his
status
shall
be
considered
as
one
who
is
a
--
as
an
excluded
alien
who
shall
be
deported
in
the
united
states
immediately
without
a
hearing.
i
believe
that
is
significant
because
the
crux
of
our
argument
is
that
--
the
crux
of
the
government's
argument
adversely
is
this,
the
government
says
that
section
237
is
exclusive
as
to
excluded
alien
that
no
other
provisions
of
the
statute
cover
excluded
aliens,
that
section
243
is
exclusive
in
dealing
with
aliens
who
are
expelled
from
the
united
states.
we
say
this
cannot
be
so.
we
say
it
cannot
be
so
first
because
237
provides
only
for
the
deportation
of
aliens
under
this
act
and
it
is
conceded
that
the
aliens
here
are
not
deported
under
this
act.
secondly,
we
say
that
it
provides
only
for
the
deportation
of
the
aliens
who
are
deported
immediately.
now,
we
don't
know
how
the
word
"immediately"
shall
be
defined,
but
we
do
know
that
the
significance
of
the
word
--
we
believe
that
the
significance
of
the
word
immediate
is
that
when
deportation
is
immediate,
the
alien
can
be
returned
on
the
ship
once
he
arrive
and
to
the
country
once
he
came.
now
obviously,
if
an
alien
is
deported
as
in
this
case,
six
years
later,
he
cannot
be
deported
on
the
ship
once
he
arrived,
nor
can
he
very
often
and
if
we
are
to
in
construe
the
statutes
to
cover
all
situations,
very
often
he
cannot
be
deported
to
the
country
once
he
came.
i'll
discuss
for
a
moment
the
country
of
hong
kong,
not
the
country,
but
the
british
crown
colony
of
hong
kong.
i
believe
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
are
some
400,000
chinese
in
hong
kong
who
don't
have
permanent
residence
there.
they're
living
on
roof
tops.
they're
living
in
sewers.
it's
been
a
problem
which
has
been
concerning
united
nations
for
some
years
now.
it
has
and
it
has
happened.
the
government
has
indicated
its
annual
reports
that
they
couldn't
get
travel
documents
to
return
chinese
to
hong
kong
because
the
city
is
just
over
crowded
with
refugees.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
hong
kong
is
willing
only
to
give
transit
visas
so
that
aliens
can
be
returned
to
china.
they
do
not
want
anymore
aliens
in
hong
kong,
whether
they're
excluded
aliens
from
the
united
states
or
whether
they
are
deported
aliens
from
the
united
states.
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
as
to
kaplan
against
tod
that
when
the
little
girl
kaplan
came
here,
she
came
here
from
tsarist,
russia.
presumably,
she
could
be
--
or
poland.
she
could
return
to
that
country.
but
eight
years
later
when
the
government
sought
to
return
her,
tsarist,
russia
had
become
bolshevik,
russia
who
will
not
receive
aliens.
poland
perhaps
might
have
received
them,
but
the
political
status
of
the
country's
changed.
in
the
mitzi
case
with
which
this
court
has
a
--
i'm
sure
a
deep
recollection.
mitzi
was
an
alien
who
was
excluded
from
this
--
from
the
united
states,
who
came
to
this
country
from
france.
france
wouldn't
take
him.
well,
the
government
as
it
--
as
it
appears
from
opinion
of
this
court
sought
to
return
him
not
only
to
france
which
wouldn't
take
him,
but
they
tried
to
get
hungary
to
take
him
back
on
a
theory
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
hungary.
they
tried
to
get
great
britain
where
he
had
not
lived
ever,
except
in
gibraltar
where
he
claimed
to
have
been
born.
they
tried
to
get
great
britain
to
take
him
back
on
the
theory
that
he
was
a
national
of
great
britain.
in
this
very
case,
or
in
leng
ma
may,
they
have
sought
to
get
china
to
take
him
back
even
though
it
appears
on
this
record
that
the
aliens
have
come
from
hong
kong.
so,
it
is
clear
that
the
problems
that
the
government
has
been
confronted
with
in
--
in
connection
with
deporting
excluded
aliens
and
expellable
aliens
do
not
relate
only
to
aliens
who
are
residents
of
the
united
states
and
who
are
being
expelled
from
the
united
states
under
an
expulsion
process,
but
they
are
concerned
just
as
much
with
excluded
aliens
who
may
be
stuck
at
ellis
island
or
maybe
stuck
in
the
ports
of
entry
in
san
francisco
or
other
places
of
the
country
who
may
have
to
stay
here
as
mitzi
did
for
three
or
four
years
until
finally,
the
government
in
its
grace
decided
to
let
him
into
this
country.
now,
after
the
decision
of
this
court,
so
the
specific
legislative
problems,
the
specific
policy
considerations
that
the
government
has
talked
about
relates
just
as
much
to
excluded
aliens
as
they
do
it
to
expellable
aliens.
and
that,
we
submit
if
it
pleases
the
court
is
the
reason
that
in
1950,
the
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states
expanded
the
range
of
countries.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
government's
recount
of
the
legislative
history
which
indicates
that
it
shall
not
go
--
be
applied
to
excluded
aliens.
i
say
that
because
of
this,
the
first
part
of
the
1950
act,
the
hobbs
bill
was
designed
to
tighten
up
controls
over
deported
--
deportable
subversives
in
the
united
states
who
are
residents
of
this
country.
while
that
act
was
under
consideration,
it
was
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question.
it
was
senator
frank
p.
graham
of
north
carolina
who
proposed
in
committee
the
provision
with
regard
to
physical
persecution.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
those
committee
hearings
and
unfortunately,
they
have
not
been
printed,
but
there
was
no
suggestion
in
those
committee
hearings
that
it
applied
only
to
expellable
aliens
rather
than
to
excluded
aliens.
but
it
was
after
this
bill
which
relate
it
true
enough
to
aliens
resident
of
the
united
states
that
the
bill
was
amended
to
provide
that
no
alien
shall
be
deported
--
who
is
deportable
under
this
chapter
shall
be
deported
to
a
country
in
which
he
will
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
well
this
chapter,
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
circuit
held
in
the
chong
case,
included
both
the
excluded
aliens
and
aliens
who
are
being
expelled.
so,
it
was
clear
that
the
original
law
could
be
held
and
was
held
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
decision
which
the
government
did
not
ask
to
have
reviewed
by
this
court,
applied
both
to
excluded
aliens
and
to
aliens
being
expelled.
mr.
david
carliner
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not
speak
of
resident
aliens.
mr.
david
carliner
the
bill
and
the
government
has
discussed
it
at
long
length
on
page
16
and
17
of
its
brief.
it
refers
to
aliens
unlawfully
in
the
united
states.
mr.
david
carliner
yes,
that
the
first
--
that
the
hobbs
bill
was
--
was
devoted
to
the
main
portions
of
it.
the
substance
of
it
was
devoted
to
tightening
up
supervision
of
aliens
who
were
in
the
united
states
subject
to
expulsion
process,
required
that
they
shall
at
the
writ
to
which
the
decision
overruled
said
that
they
should
give
reports
as
to
where
they
are
in
the
united
states
in
the
newspapers
they
read
and
so
on.
that
was
the
original
purpose
of
the
hobbs
bill
h.r.
10.
well
that
--
and
that
related
to
aliens
who
are
in
the
united
states
subject
to
expulsion
from
this
country.
mr.
david
carliner
senator
graham's
proposal
was
included
in
--
because
that
was
the
internal
security
act
which
is
rather
an
omnibus
bill
that
included
many
things.
mr.
david
carliner
yes,
but
as
you
said,
ultimately
enacted
--
enacted
in
relation
to
internal
security
act
which
was
on
the
omnibus
proposal
--
mr.
david
carliner
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
a
separate
chapter.
but
it
provided
and
this
appears
on
page
17
of
the
government's
brief.
it
is
further
provided
that
no
alien,
the
rest
of
that
relates
to
deportable
aliens.
it
says
that
no
alien
shall
be
deported
to
any
country
in
which
the
attorney
general
shall
punish
and
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
mr.
david
carliner
i
don't
know
for
certain.
mr.
david
carliner
i
don't
know
for
certain,
your
honor,
because
there
isn't
any
legislative
history,
i
do
know
the
service
disagreed
with
the
chong
decision
even
after
it
was
--
mr.
david
carliner
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
carliner
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
one
additional
point
which
i
think
is
very
significant
is
this
--
that
the
language
deportable
alien,
the
government
interprets
to
mean
only
an
alien
who
is
expelled
from
the
united
states.
now,
there
is
no
warrant
for
that
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
or
in
any
other
because
an
alien
who
is
excluded
from
the
united
states
is
just
as
deportable
as
an
alien
who's
expelled
from
the
united
states.
section
237
of
the
act
referring
to
excluded
aliens
refers
to
them
precisely
as
being
deportable
and
the
mitzi
case
points
up
the
fact
that
these
aliens
who
are
excluded
are
also
deportable.
