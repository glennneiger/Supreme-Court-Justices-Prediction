william

rogers,
attorney
general,
petitioner
versus
jimmie
quan,
et
al.
mr.
sand,
you
may
proceed
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
going
to
say,
now
you
go
back
to
that
word
legally
within
the
united
states,
if
they'd
sneaked
over
the
border
or
had
sneaked
in
on
a
ship
as
a
stowaway
or
anything
else,
they'd
be
entitled
to
this
discretionary
relief
according
to
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
mean
legally
within
the
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
i
read
something,
a
report
of
the
attorney
general,
not
more
than
a
year
or
two
ago,
but
in
my
own
state,
there
were
about
200,000
who
had
recently
gone
across
the
--
come
into
this
country
by
sneaking
across
the
--
the
border.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
the
inference
was
there
was
there
wasn't
any
real
effort
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it
and
he
pretend
--
was
protesting
against
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
all
of
those
200,000
or
if
that
is
--
if
that
is
the
number
in
that
state
would
be
entitled
to
this
kind
of
--
of
relief.
but
those
hungarians
who
were
brought
over
here
by
this
--
by
this
country
and
who
were
placed
upon
parole
because
they
didn't
have
time
to
process
them
were
--
are
not
susceptible
to
that
kind
of
relief.
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
power
not
to
parole
them
too,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
the
power
to
exclude
them
by
officers
patrolling
the
border
and
the
power
to
--
to
exclude
them
by
a
failure
to
parole
them
or
refuse
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
