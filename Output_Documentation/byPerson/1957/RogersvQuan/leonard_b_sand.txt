mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
involves
five
natives
of
china
who
arrived
in
the
united
states
seeking
admission
at
various
dates.
four
of
them,
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
immigration
act
of
1952,
and
the
fifth,
leng
may
ma,
subsequent
to
the
effective
date.
all
of
the
aliens
were
--
were
ordered
excluded
and
again,
as
in
the
previous
case,
no
question
is
raised
as
to
the
validity
of
the
orders
of
an
exclusion.
also
as
in
the
--
in
the
prior
case,
the
aliens
were
--
were
granted
parole.
applications
under
243
(h)
were
filed
and
the
attorney
general
took
the
position
as
he
did
in
the
earlier
case
that
he
had
no
power
to
act
under
that
statute.
the
plaintiff
of
the
--
the
respondents
sought
declaratory
relief
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reversed,
holding
it
that
when
the
alien
was
paroled
into
the
united
states,
he
was
then
an
alien
within
the
united
states,
within
the
meaning
of
section
243
(h).
in
short
therefore,
the
issues
presented
by
this
case
are
in
no
major
respects
identical
with
those
in
the
earlier
case.
and
i
would
like
now
to
direct
myself
to
the
--
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
black
posed
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
previous
argument
and
that
is
whether
congress
in
the
immigration
act
of
1952
explicitly
provided
that
parole
would
not
author
the
immigration
status
of
the
alien.
and
i
think
we
have
to
begin,
if
i
may,
with
the
same
perspective
that
the
congress
which
passed
this
act
began
and
that
is
in
the
light
of
history
because
the
concept
of
paroling
excluded
aliens
is
not
a
new
one.
in
the
case
of
kaplan
against
tod,
the
petitioner
was
small
child,
had
the
misfortune
of
being
feeble-minded.
she
came
to
the
united
states
in
the
company
of
her
mother
to
join
her
father.
she
was
ordered
excluded
because
of
her
mental
condition.
she
was
paroled
to
a
welfare
society
which
in
turn
placed
her
in
the
custody
of
her
father.
world
war
i
intervenes,
so
that
it
was
not
safe
to
send
the
child
back
to
the
country
from
which
she
came.
for
nine
years,
she
in
fact
lived
with
her
father
in
the
united
states.
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
unanimous
court
in
kaplan
against
tod
said
that
--
that
paroling
the
excluded
alien
did
not
bring
her
in
the
united
states
therefore
purposes
of
the
naturalization
act
and
for
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
were
two
--
there
were
two
aspects
to
that
case,
mr.
justice
douglas.
one,
was
whether
she
became
naturalized
by
virtue
of
the
naturalization
of
her
father
and
the
language
in
that
provision
was
dwelling
in
the
united
states.
but
there
was
a
second
question
in
that
case,
which
is
closer
to
the
question
now
before
the
court
and
that
was
--
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
which
read
in
part,
any
alien
who
shall
have
entered
or
who
shall
be
found
in
the
united
states
in
violation
of
this
act.
and
the
question
which
was
before
the
court
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
whether
this
petitioner
had
entered
or
shall
be
found
in
or
whether
she
was
found
in
the
united
states.
and
mr.
justice
holmes,
referring
to
the
--
to
the
cases
which
even
then
had
--
were
of
long
standing,
held
that
she
was
not.
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
perspective
which
congress
had
when
it
enacted
section
212
(d)
(5)
of
the
act.
and
that
is
the
provision
which
provides
that
the
attorney
general
may
in
his
discretion
parole
into
the
united
states
aliens
who
were
applying
for
admission.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
provide
in
very
explicit
language.
i'm
reading
from
page
3
of
the
--
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent
in
leng
may
ma,
when
the
purposes
of
such
parole
have
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
--
when
the
purposes
of
such
parole
shall
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
have
been
served,
the
alien
shall
forthwith
return
or
be
returned
to
the
custody
from
whence
he
was
paroled.
and
thereafter,
his
case
shall
continue
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
any
other
applicant
for
admission
to
the
united
states.
the
legislative
history
of
212
(d)
(5)
indicates
as
--as
the
act
itself
would
indicate,
that
in
considering
section
237
(a),
which
is
the
section
which
the
government
submits
controls
here.
one
must
read
that
statute
in
the
light
of
212
(d)
(5).
section
237
(a)
provides
that
any
alien
who
is
excluded
under
this
act
shall
be
immediately
deported
to
the
country
whence
he
came,
skipping
some
irrelevant
traces,
unless
the
attorney
general
in
an
individual
case
in
his
discretion
concludes
that
immediate
deportation
is
not
practicable
or
proper.
in
other
words,
under
237
(a)
as
provided,
the
excluded
alien
shall
be
immediately
sent
back
to
the
country
from
whence
he
came,
unless
the
attorney
general
decides
that
immediate
action
is
not
practical
or
proper.
the
consequences
of
such
a
determination
are
spelled
out
in
212
(d)
(5)
because
it
is
there
provided,
that
following
the
period
of
parole,
the
status
shall
be
that
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
any
other
applicant
for
admission
to
the
united
states.
the
status
is
the
same
as
the
alien
had
prior
to
the
period
of
parole.
the
legislative
history
of
these
statutes
reinforces
this.
in
an
earlier
draft
of
the
1952
act,
the
parole
provision
of
212
(d)
(5)
was
limited
to
medical
reasons.
the
statute
gave
the
attorney
general
power
to
parole
only
for
medical
reasons
and
the
immigration
service
comments
which
occurrence
to
congress
--
excuse
me
--
to
test
the
--
the
rigidity
of
that
provision
and
urge
that
there
be
placed
in
the
statute
a
broader
parole
authority.
and
with
respect
to
section
237
(a),
the
service
also
made
a
comment
with
respect
to
parole
and
that
appears
at
page
6
of
the
reply
brief
for
the
petitioner
in
the
--
in
this
case.
and
the
provision
which
the
immigration
suggested
--
the
immigration
service
suggested,
read
in
pertinent
part
that
following
parole.
whenever
the
attorney
general,
in
his
discretion,
concludes
that
deportation
of
an
alien
paroled
under
this
subsection
is
practical
or
proper,
the
alien
shall
immediately
be
taken
into
custody
under
the
outstanding
order
of
exclusion
and
deportation,
and
shall
be
deported
without
further
hearing
in
the
same
manner
as
other
aliens
who
are
excluded
from
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
it
was
explicitly
provided
in
the
suggested
language
of
the
immigration
service
with
respect
to
the
section
237
that
following
parole,
the
alien
shall
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
other
aliens
who
are
excluded
from
the
united
states.
what
congress
did
in
the
1952
act,
rather
than
have
one
parole
provision
in
section
237
(a)
and
another
parole
provision
in
212
(d),
it
broadened
the
language
of
212
(d)
(5).
and
since
that
section
dealt
not
only
with
excluded
aliens
but
with
all
aliens
who
are
seeking
admission
to
the
united
states.
the
language
used
was
thereafter
his
case
shall
continue
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
any
other
applicant
for
admission
to
the
united
states.
the
status
quo
is
retained
and
this
is
--
as
counsel
for
petitioner
in
the
prior
case
stated
in
response
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
merely
a
statutory
recognition
of
what
has
been
the
immigration
practice
of
this
country
in
modern
times,
and
that
is
that
parole
of
an
alien
does
not
alter
the
immigration
status.
now
in
this
case,
in
seeking
to
avoid
this
explicit
statutory
provision,
counsel
for
the
respondents
emphasized
that
thereafter
in
212
(d)
(5).
it
says
thereafter,
after
the
parole
is
terminated,
he
shall
continue
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manners
as
that
of
any
other
applicant
for
admission
to
the
united
states.
and
so,
they
urge
that
it's
true
that
once
the
parole
is
revoked
the
alien
maybe
treated
as
an
excluded
alien,
but
during
the
period
in
which
parole
continues
the
alien
is
within
the
united
states.
and
i
again,
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
is
a
concept
which
requires
in
the
first
instance
a
disregard
of
the
past
history
and
a
disregard
of
--
of
the
intent
of
congress,
but
it's
a
concept
which
is
hostile
to
parole.
in
other
words,
if
the
immigration
service
revoked
the
parole,
brought
all
the
aliens
back
into
the
detention
center
then
they
would
be
excluded
aliens.but
no
purpose
would
be
served
by
requiring
the
alien
to
return
to
physical
detention
while
the
immigration
status
is
being
determined.
there's
a
paradox
in
this
case
because
one
recalls
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
tom
wi
shang
and
the
question
was
whether
declaratory
relief
was
available
to
an
excluded
alien
or
whether
the
only
remedy
was
habeas
corpus.
and
once
they
are
heard,
counsel
for
the
alien
saying,
don't
require
the
alien
to
go
back
into
physical
custody
to
have
his
immigration
status
determined.?
precisely
the
opposite
of
the
argument
that
is
--
that
is
made
in
this
case.
throughout
the
immigration
act
of
1952,
one
finds
that
congress
distinguished
between
excluded
aliens
and
alien
subject
to
deportation.
separate
administrative
processes
are
setup,
separate
grounds
for
exclusion
and
separate
grounds
for
deportation
are
provided.
one
cannot
read
the
immigration
act
of
1952
in
its
entirety
without
recognizing
the
fact
that
this
historic
distinction
in
the
treatment
of
aliens
was
retained
in
this
statute.
now,
the
argument
is
made
that
section
237
(a),
which
is
the
exclusion
statute,
applies
only
when
the
alien
is
immediately
sent
back
to
the
country
whence
he
came.
this
was
the
basic
reasoning
of
the
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
chang
case
which
is
under
the
1917
act.
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
237
(a)
applied
only
where
the
return
was
immediate
and
that
if
the
return
was
not
immediate
then
the
deportation
provisions
apply.
respectfully
submit,
that
that
argument
cannot
be
supported
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
statutes.
in
succeeding
provisions
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
chang
case,
which
was
a
case
in
which
the
aliens
were
being
detained
by
the
government
for
purposes
of
prosecution
and
could
not
leave
if
they
wished
to
leave.
said
there
deportation
within
the
meaning
of
237
(a),
it
chooses
that
word,
is
not
immediate
and
therefore
the
statute
does
not
apply.
now,
that
is
the
only
construction
that
i
know
of,
of
immediate.
in
the
light
of
the
language
of
the
1952
act
and
the
provision
in
212
(d)
(5),
i
submit
that
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
one
has
--
one
has
read
since
land
border
cases.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
land
border
cases,
cases
in
which
the
alien
is
coming
from
canada
or
mexico.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
the
--
and
the
service
finds
that
the
alien
is
not
admissible
and
the
alien
--
it
doesn't
choose
to
have
a
board
of
special
inquiry
pass
upon
it
and
--
and
literally
immediately
leaves.
if
that
construction
in
a
literal
requirement
of
immediate
return
is
found
to
be
a
correct
one
then
the
power
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
alien
to
compel
his
admission
into
the
united
states.
because
under
section
236
--
236
(a)
of
the
immigration
act,
an
applicant
for
admission
is
entitled
to
have
this
case
heard
by
a
board
of
special
inquiry
and
have
a
decision
based
on
the
records
of
those
procedure.
and
he
has
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
attorney
general
which
operates
his
stay.
and
so,
that
it
is
possible
for
the
alien
by
--
by
invoking
these
statutory
procedures
to
which
he
is
entitled.
as
--
as
in
these
very
cases
to
bring
it
about
that
he
is
not
immediately
sent
back
to
the
country
from
whence
he
came.
and
therefore,
under
the
--
under
the
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
alien
simply
by
presenting
himself
at
the
gates
and
consisting
in
these
procedures
comes
within
the
concept
that
aliens
legally
found
in
this
country.
but
judge
learned
hand
has
said
that
no
alien
can
force
--
can
force
us
to
admit
him
and
surely
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
passed
the
immigration
act
of
1952
to
compress
such
a
power
upon
the
aliens.
the
--
the
chang
case
which
was
the
--
the
precedent
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
of
district
of
columbia
relied
in
this
case
is
as
i
said
previously
a
decision
under
the
1917
act,
which
did
not
contain
the
phrase
within
the
united
states
in
the
--
in
the
predecessor
of
section
243
(h).
and
therefore,
we
submit
distinguishable
on
those
grounds
and
on
the
further
grounds
that
there
the
aliens
could
not
have
gone
back
even
if
they
wanted
to,
it
was
the
united
states
which
was
keeping
the
aliens
here,
requiring
them
to
be
here.
reference
is
made
in
the
case
to
the
experience
with
respect
to
the
hungarian
refugees
during
the
--
in
very
recent
times.
and
the
fact
that
--
that
parole
under
212
(d)
(5)
is
granted
to
many
thousands
of
them
and
they
were
brought
to
this
country.
but
this
doesn't
establish
as
respondents
would
--
would
have
it
established,
that
there
is
any
absolute
right
of
asylum.
there
was
--
as
to
those
aliens
they
were
of
course
screened
and
the
determination
was
made
by
the
immigration
service,
which
would
be
permitted
entry
into
the
united
states
under
the
reading
of
immediate
which
is
given
to
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
power
passes
from
the
congress
and
passes
from
the
--
from
the
immigration
service
into
the
hands
of
the
alien,
and
that
of
course
is
a
result
which
congress
could
not
have
intended.
counsel
for
the
respondents
contend
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
explicit
language
of
the
1952
act,
that
because
for
the
respondents
sought
entry
into
the
united
states
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
1952
act,
they
are
controlled
by
the
provisions
of
the
act
as
it
then
existed,
the
1917
act.
under
either
the
1917
act
or
the
1952
act,
these
aliens
were
excludible
and
were
subject
to
being
sent
back
to
the
country
from
whence
they
came.
and
so,
there
was
no
difference
under
either
act,
with
respect
to
that
aspect
of
their
status.
but
the
claim
is
made
that
the
applications
for
relief
are
governed
not
by
the
1952
act
and
by
the
language
of
243
(h)
deportation
of
any
alien
within
the
united
states,
but
governed
by
the
1917
act.
we
submit
that
under
either
act
the
attorney
general
had
no
power
to
act,
but
the
--
but
it
is
clear
that
an
application
for
the
withholding
of
deportation
under
243
(h),
like
the
--
like
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
is
a
separate
proceeding
which
is
governed
by
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
the
application
was
made.
and
all
the
applications
for
relief
in
this
case
were
made
subsequent
to
the
1952
act.
and
in
fact,
at
the
allegations
and
the
complaints
spell
out,
relief
was
sought
only
under
the
1952
act.
in
--
in
short,
the
basic
premise
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
congress
recognized
the
distinction
between
excluded
aliens
and
aliens
who
were
in
the
united
states
and
was
subject
only
to
deportation.
that
section
243
(h),
into
which
congress
inserted
the
specific
phrase
within
the
united
states
has
application
only
to
aliens
who
are
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
as
well
as
in
physical
fact
within
the
united
states.
that
congress
would
have
had
no
other
purpose
in
inserting
the
phrase
within
the
united
states
in
the
provision,
unless
it
was
to
make
clear
that
it
did
not
apply
to
excluded
aliens.
the
government
further
submits
that
the
concept
of
parole,
because
here
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
aliens
were
within
the
united
states
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
paroled.
that
with
disregard
to
parole
congress
has
explicitly
stated
what
has
been
the
long
established
law
of
immigration
in
this
country,
that
parole
does
not
alter
the
immigration
status
of
the
alien,
that
a
great
retains
the
status
quo.
and
the
government
respectfully
submits
that
if
that
distinction
is
obliterated,
if
one
looks
only
to
the
physical
fact
that
the
--
that
the
policy
which
is
presently
pursued
by
the
attorney
general,
which
is
to
grant
parole
except
where
the
alien
is
thought
likely
to
abscond
were
to
be
a
security
risk,
would
have
to
be
reevaluated.
there
were
obviously
have
to
be
another
consideration,
which
enters
into
the
question
of
whether
parole
would
be
granted,
and
that
consideration
would
be
what
alterations
in
the
immigration
status
of
the
alien
will
result
from
this
parole.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
the
--
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
camezon
case,
which
is
a
district
case
in
southern
district
of
new
york,
the
judge
analyses
all
of
the
legislative
history,
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
243
(h).
and
he
reached
this
conclusion,
he
said,
one
calls
the
legislative
history
in
vein
and
it
is
bare
of
any
indication
that
congress
intended,
to
use
his
words,
the
humanitarian
concept
of
withholding
deportation
on
grounds
of
physical
persecution
to
apply
to
excluded
aliens,
obviously
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
obviously
since
humanitarian
concept
here
and
that
with
respect
to
an
alien
who
was
--
who
was
in
this
country,
there
is
a
desire
manifested
by
congress
in
these
statutory
provisions
with
the
limitations
contained
in
this
statutory
provisions,
not
to
send
such
an
alien
back
to
a
country
to
which
he
be
subject
to
physical
prosecution.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
--
the
original
--
this
provision
first
saw
the
light
of
day
in
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
it
was
then
section
20
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know.
i
know
that
i
became
a
part
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
which
was
in
many
respects
an
omnibus
measure.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know.
but
i
think
that
the
difference
in
the
language
between
section
20
as
it
was
--
as
it
first
saw
the
light
of
days
i
say
in
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
and
the
changes
that
were
made
by
congress
in
the
1952
act
are
significance
in
this
case.
because
in
the
20
act
--
in
the
section
20,
the
act,
that
no
alien
shall
be
deported
under
any
provisions
of
this
act
to
any
country
in
which
the
attorney
general
shall
find
that
such
alien
would
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
well
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
yes,
i
submit
that
when
the
congress
in
the
1952
act
inserted
the
phrase
within
the
united
states
since
this
could
not
--
obviously,
not
have
reference
to
the
geographical
fact,
it
could
only
have
reference
to
the
established
principle
that
an
excluded
alien,
regardless
of
parole
was
not
within
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
legislative
history
does
not
indicate
that.
the
--
as
it
passed
the
house
and
senate
versions,
the
language
retained
was
--
the
language
was
that
of
the
--
of
the
previous
act.
and
--
and
when
it
emerges
from
the
house
senate
conference
committee
the
language
has
changed
to
read,
the
attorney
general
may
withhold
deportation
of
any
alien
within
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
mccarran
and
walter
were
of
course
the
two
congressmen
who
were
principally
responsible
for
this
legislation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
there
was
--
the
report
indicates
that
this
provision
was
put
in,
that
the
for
humanitarian
reasons,
one
will
recall
that
there
were
--
at
this
time
there
were
various
bills
pending
and
there
was
a
proposed
bill
introduced
by
senator
lehman,
which
would
have
broadened
this
provision,
which
would
have
gone
on
to
say,
you're
subject
to
discrimination
on
grounds
of
race,
religion,
and
that
bill
was
defeated.
so
one
doesn't
find
specific
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
change
which
was
made
but
we
submit
that
the
change
speaks
for
itself
because
those
words
are
meaningless.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
within
the
united
states
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
it
can
have
only
two
meanings
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
and
the
only
meaning,
which
makes
sense
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
because
we
are
faced
with
this
problem,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
i
don't
think
has
determined
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
it
is
in
a
position
to
grant
asylum
to
all
persons
behind
the
iron
curtain
who
wish
to
come
here.
and
if
the
physical
presence
of
an
alien
at
the
border,
regardless
of
whether
that
alien
is
excluded
or
not,
entitles
the
alien
to
the
relief
under
section
243
(h).
then
there
is
a
very
serious
problem
as
to
the
--
to
the
limitation
of
the
numbers
who
could
compel
entry.
now,
if
this
were
the
ideal
world,
perhaps
the
policies
could
be
different.
but
obviously
there
must
be
some
limit
and
i
think
that
therefore
it
is
not
irrational
to
say
that
congress
was
not
irrational
when
it
gave
to
the
attorney
general
discretionary
relief
under
212
(d)
(5),
but
limited
243
(h)
to
aliens
who
were
within
--
legally
within
the
united
states.
i
think
--
i
think
there
is
that
reason,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
have
the
power.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
mean,
within
the
united
states
in
the
contemplation
of
the
law.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
misspoke
myself.
we
have
the
power
of
course
to
parole
our
borders,
to
control
who
will
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
of
course
we
are.
and
so
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
it's
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
the
immigration
act
of
1952
is
written
with
a
concept
that
the
excluded
alien
--
that
--
that
aliens
will
present
themselves
in
the
--
except
--
except
where
provision
is
made
for
other
cases,
aliens
will
present
themselves
in
--
at
the
--
to
the
authorities
at
the
border.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
at
various
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that
--
that
is
true
and
that
again
goes
back
to
the
--
to
the
basic
concept
that
where
the
government
has
the
power
because
the
alien
has
not
sneaked
across
the
border,
the
alien
has
presented
himself
as
the
overwhelming
majority
of
aliens
do
to
the
authorities.
where
the
government
has
the
power
to
physically
keep
the
alien
out
because
it
will
require
time
to
determine
whether
the
alien
should
be
admitted
or
excluded.
to
determine
as
in
--
as
in
these
cases
--
as
in
some
of
these
cases
the
validity
of
the
claim
of
parentage.
that
during
that
period
of
time
you'll
not
keep
the
alien
on
the
vessel
in
the
detention
center.
the
alien
who
sneaks
across
the
border,
we
can
control
as
we
do
at
various
places
by
paroling
our
borders.
we
--
we
have
power
to
control
whether
or
not
those
aliens
will
come
into
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
the
power
not
to
parole
and
in
this
case
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
is
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
difference
is
this,
where
there
is
the
power
of
detention
and
that
power
is
exercised,
the
alien
is
kept
physically
in
the
detention
center.
counsel
in
this
case
concede
that
they
would
not
be
within
the
united
states
and
so
there
is
the
additional
aspect
to
this
argument.
the
question
is
whether
release
from
the
detention
center,
which
is
something
which
is
within
the
control
then
and
there
for
the
government
authorities
as
it
is
not
in
the
control
of
the
government
authorities
where
the
alien
has
eluded
detection
sneaking
across
the
border.
whether
the
exercise
of
that
power,
which
the
attorney
general
has
to
release
or
not
to
release
the
alien
on
parole
will
cause
the
immigration
status
of
the
alien
to
change.
because
if
it
does,
we
suggest,
that
that
is
a
factor
which
has
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
parole
the
alien.
and
the
policy
which
is
now
pursued
of
paroling
all
aliens
except
those
thought
likely
to
abscond
were
to
be
security
risks
would
have
to
be
reevaluated.
and
that
is
why
as
i
said
earlier
there
is
the
paradox
in
this
case
of
counsel
for
the
aliens
urging
a
concept
which
is
--
which
is
hostile
to
parole.
because
the
very
nature
of
parole
is
the
--
the
immigration
status
of
the
alien
remains
undisturbed.
that
you
need
not
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
parole
the
alien,
what
consequence
that
would
have
on
the
--
on
the
immigration
status.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
don't
but
i
would
imagine
that
figure
is
contained
in
the
annual
report
of
the
attorney
general.
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
resident
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
of
--
of
resident
aliens
in
the
united
states,
no,
i
have
the
figures
for
the
aliens
who
have
been
--
who
have
been
excluded
in
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
regardless
of
--
yes,
resident
aliens
from
1950,
i
would
--
i
would
endeavor
to
--
i'd
see
to
that.
