justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
semaan,
isn't
there
some
relevancy
to
the
list
of
questions
on
page
74
going
back
to
that
examination
before
the
parole
board
when
he
was
asked
the
third
question,
mr.
barrera,
you
knew
what
time
to
ask
these
questions
on
direct
examination,
would
take
effect
in
the
first
direct
examination
filed
doesn't
it?on
--
before
the
state
had
rested
you
have
knowledge
of
the
fact
and
so
had
divorced
mr.
green
that
natividad
had
on
several
occasions
said
in
the
court
for
herlinda.
i'll
speak
of
what
i
have
knowledge
of
and
mr.
green
will
speak
for
himself.
i
had
knowledge
that
castilleja
had
had
intercourse
with
his
wife
in
several
occasions
and
he
sat
there
and
asked
those
questions
and
heard
those
answers
and
did
nothing
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
not
have
some
relevance
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
so
mr.
semaan,
is
this
a
fair
appraisal
of
the
prosecutors,
whatever
you
call
--
let
me
call
on
that
fact.
this
is
indicia
thing
of
his
position
at
74
is
within
my
province
at
the
time
i
am
preparing
a
case
as
to
what
testimony
i
think
is
admissible
and
what
testimony
i
think
is
not
admissible
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
my
questions
and
answers,
defile
tactics
to
this
case
with
enticing
of
what
i
think
the
law
is.
and
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
barrera
may
i
--
may
i
ask,
you
knew
when
you
asked
these
series
of
questions
as
i
understand
it
that
these
illicit
acts
or
several
of
what
he's
told
you
about
had
occurred
according
to
him
in
his
automobile
at
various
places.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
knew
that
when
you
asked
these
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
beginning
those
questions
in
which
that
he
talked
about
love
and
so
forth.
what
about
these
two
questions?
"had
you
ever
had
any
dates
with
her
other
than
to
take
her
home?
no,
well
just
when
i
brought
her
from
there.
just
when
you
brought
her
from
work?
yes.
now,
was
it
the
plain
implication
of
that
had
been
to
contend
the
jury
to
understand
that
the
only
times
he
had
her
in
the
automobile
were
those
times
when
he
took
her
home.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
already
knew
that
that's
not
the
fact
that
he
had
had
her
in
the
automobile
on
several
occasions
when
according
to
him
as
he
had
told
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
had
had
illicit
relations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
don't
you
with
that
knowledge,
how
could
he
possibly
not
have
appreciated
that
his
answers
to
these
questions
were
false
if
you
were
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is
obviously,
he
wasn't
telling
the
truth,
to
your
knowledge
he
wasn't
telling
the
truth
when
he
said
that
he's
never
had
any
dates
with
her
and
the
only
time
he'd
ever
had
her
in
the
automobile
was
to
drive
her
home
from
work.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
question
was,
had
you
ever
had
any
dates
with
her
other
than
to
take
her
home?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
well
just
when
i
brought
her
from
there.
just
when
you
brought
her
from
work?
yes.
that
was
your
question,
just
when
you
brought
her
from
work.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
barrera,
(inaudible)
you
had
questions
whether
if
those
questions
were
admissible
that
they
were
not
objected.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
wanted
to
show
that
it
was
not
binding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
were
not
objecting
to
the
(inaudible)
the
consequence
that
they
were
all
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
also
say
that
the
question
on
whether
there
had
been
an
illicit
relation
of
his
wife
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
not
