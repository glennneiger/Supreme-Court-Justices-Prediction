mr.
semaan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
is
that
on
--
on
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
--
oh
towards
the
bottom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
your
reading
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
72.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
excuse
me,
i
thought
you
said
22.go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
gravamen
of
--
of
your
--
your
argument
that
he
asked
these
questions
of
the
defendant
and
received
these
answers
knowing
that
they
were
untrue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
question,
“she's
married.
now,
other
than
the
time
you
saw
or
met
herlinda
alcorta
at
your
sister's
home,
did
you
ever
see
her
on
other
occasions?”
“well,
i
give
here
about
two
times
--
i
give
her
a
ride.”
“you
gave
her
a
ride
about
two
times?”
“yes
sir.”
“from
where
to
where?”
“from
where
she
was
working
to
her
house.”
“natividad,
were
you
in
love
with
herlinda?”
now,
isn't
this
the
gist
of
what
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
“natividad,
were
you
in
love
with
herlinda?”
“no.”
“was
she
in
love
with
you?”
“no.”
“had
you
ever
talked
about
love?”
“had
you
ever
had
any
dates
with
her
other
than
to
take
her
home?”
“no,
well
just
when
i
brought
her
from
here.”
“just
when
you
brought
her
from
her
work?”
“yes.”
and
you
say
that
he
asked
those
questions
and
elicited
those
answers
knowing
from
the
lips
of
the
witness
himself
that
he
had
had
different
relations
and
that
he,
the
prosecutor,
told
him
not
to
tell
that
to
--
to
counsel
for
the
defense
and
not
to
--
to
mention
it
on
the
witness
stand
unless
it
was
specifically
asked
of
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
--
didn't
the
--
didn't
the
defendant
testify
that
he
actually
saw
them
kissing
and
embracing
each
other
in
the
car?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
didn't
castilleja
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
castilleja
testify
that
there
never
had
been
any
love-making
between
him.
and
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
wasn't
--
it
was
a
question
of
veracity
as
--between
him
and
castilleja
than
as
to
whether
there
have
been
ever
any
love-making
between
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
say
that
another
witness
testified
he
had
seen
castilleja
at
the
--
at
the
house
of
--
of
this
deceased?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
had
met
her
and
seen
her
on
other
occasions
than
this
outside
of
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
that
he
saw
her
dancing
with
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
was
his
testimony,
mr.
semaan
as
bearing
on
--
as
bearing
on
his
other
answers
that
he
never
had
any
dates
with
her
and
never
--
he
only
took
her
home
from
work
about
two
times.
is
there
anything
inconsistent
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barrera.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
who
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
chasing
around
with
other
fellows
he
said,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
he
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
well,
didn't
he
in
his
statement
also
say
that
she
was
chasing
around
with
other
fellows?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
says
up
there
a
little
are
there
like,
“i
told
you,
if
i
had
had
a
camera
and
waited
a
little
longer,
it
would
have
been
a
different
story.
i
would
have
brought
the
picture
and
showed
it
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
there
--
there's
something
you
left
out
there.
you
said,
“like
i
told
you,
if
i
had
had
a
camera
and
waited
a
little
longer,
if
you
would
have
--
it
would
have
been
a
different
story.
i
would've
brought
the
picture
and
showed
it
to
you.”
“isn't
that
why
you
killed
your
wife?”
“what?”
“isn't
that
why
killed
your
wife
because
she
was
kissing
castilleja?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
“in
a
way,
yes,
sir.
and
she
wasn't
taking
care
of
the
kids
either.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
he
did
tell
you
that,
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
--
did
you
ask
him
on
the
stand
whether
he
was
kissing
and
embracing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't.
why
didn't
you
ask
him
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
defendant
testified
that
--
that
they
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
doing
that.
why
didn't
controvert
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
--
would
that
stop
you
from
--
from
putting
in
one
in
redirect
and
putting
them
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
move
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
when
you
have
--
when
you
have
two
different
kinds
of
murder.
murder
with
malice
and
murder
without
malice,
you
thought
that
it
made
no
difference
in
your
case
whether
a
man
just
fired
who
was
killing
his
wife
found
her
kissing
and
embracing
another
man
in
his
automobile
on
the
public
street
at
1
o'clock
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
--
did
you
bring
out
by
your
questioning
the
fact
that
he
stopped
there
because
his
carburetor
was
--
was
not
working
and
his
car
occasionally
stopped?
was
it
your
questioning
had
brought
that
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
you
bring
out
by
your
questioning
the
fact
that
what
they
were
talking
about
was
her
going
to
church
the
next
day?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
of
course,
i
suppose
you
did
that.
it
impressed
upon
the
jury
that
it
was
a
perfectly
platonic
affair
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
that
they
were
thinking
of
their
church
and
they've
got
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
other
than
anything
essential?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barrera
though
we
have
mr.
castilleja
said
that
he
was
just
taking
her
home
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
left
the
impression
with
the
jury
that
the
relationship
was
perfectly
platonic
was
doing
nothing
wrong
with
it.
now,
mr.
--
the
defendant,
just
comes
along
and
testifies
that
he
looked
into
the
car
and
he
saw
them
kissing
and
embracing.
now,
whether
he
had
any
--
any
knowledge,
personal
knowledge
of
intimate
relationships
before,
would
it
not
have
been
proper
cross
examination
of
mr.
castilleja
to
ask
him
if
he
had
had
intercourse
with
this
--
with
this
young
woman
because
if
he
had,
wouldn't
there've
been
a
greater
probability
that
the
defendant
was
telling
the
truth
as
to
their
kissing
in
that
car
than
if
there
had
been
no
sexual
relations
at
all
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
may
have
been
that
he
also
--
that
he
also
claimed
that
in
some
place
in
the
record
that
he
saw
them
kissing
and
embracing
and
he
thought
something
else
was
going
to
happen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
of
course,
that
would
lead
you
to
a
conclusion
but
one
conclusion,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
wouldn't
the
fact
that
they
had
had
such
relations
on
prior
occasions,
give
some
cravings
to
the
fact
that
they
might
be
doing
something
there
which
would
indicate
to
his
mind
that
they
were
about
to
do
something
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
would
you
keep
that
from
--
keep
that
information
from
them
so
they
--
so
that
they
couldn't
use
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
against
the
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
don't
you
think
that
the
easiest
way
this
people
could've
had
their
--
had
the
jury
bring
in
a
--
a
hanging
verdict
against
this
defendant
would've
been
to
ask
if
his
wife
was
not
having
sexual
relations
with
this
man
after
you
had
proven
that
this
good
samaritan
was
just
taking
her
home
and
they
were
sitting
in
the
car
talking
about
church?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
barrera.
mr.
green.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
of
them
in
front
of
his
house.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
of
them
in
front
of
his
house.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
her.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
on
the
way
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
place
in
the
record
where
he
says
she
was
getting
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
say
she
was
getting
out.
well
i
just
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
know
if
the
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
green?
