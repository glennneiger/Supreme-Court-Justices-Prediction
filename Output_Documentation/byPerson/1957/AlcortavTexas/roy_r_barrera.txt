mr.
roy
r.
barrera
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
if
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
state
prosecutor
certainly
deny
each
and
everyone
of
the
allegations
contained
in
the
petitioner's
petition
for
this
court
and
that
there
have
been
so
many
statements
made
through
this
court
outside
of
the
record
that
i
would
be
hard
put
in
the
time
that
i
have
allotted
to
me
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
each
and
everyone
of
them.
i
will
desperately,
in
the
time
that
i
have,
attempt
to
show
some
of
the
misconceptions
of
the
record
that
mr.
semaan
has,
i
imagine,
inadvertently
left
before
this
court.
he
talks
about
alvaro
alcorta
making
statements
on
the
stand
about
the
misconduct
of
his
wife,
what
he
had
seen
and
allegedly
seen
having
to
do
with
castilleja
in
the
many
night
clubs
that
he
had
seen
her
at
and
so
forth.
i
refer
the
court
now
to
page
183
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
where
we're
going
to
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
183.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
i
was
the
prosecutor.
i
am
the
ogre
in
this
case.
and
i
want
to
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
questions
with
respect
to
--
were
you
in
love
with
her,
was
she
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
in
love
with
you?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
did.
now,
the
reasons
i
will
get
to
those
questions
that
i
do
certainly
intend
to
get
to
but
i
wanted
to
get
on
the
proposition
here
of
the
overall
picture
and
what
brought
about
this
matter
here.
the
killing
as
it
took
place
and
the
facts
of
this
case
and
some
of
the
facts
that
we
appeal
the
court
must
have
before
it
in
order
to
properly
determine
what
took
place
and
the
reasons
that
it
did
is
that
approximately
30
days
before
the
deceased
in
this
case,
herlinda
alcorta,
died
at
the
hands
of
her
husband
she
had
been
threatened
with
serious
bodily
injury
and
death
by
her
husband
as
a
result
of
which
he
was
placed
under
a
peace
bond
30
days
before
he
killed
her.
that
--
that
is
reflected
of
course
in
the
record
on
page
173
and
also
in
his
confession
where
he
admits
that
he
was
placed
under
a
peace
bond
by
judge
teilborg.
two
days
before
he
took
his
wife's
life,
alvaro
alcorta
again
threatened
to
kill
her
and
then
made
statements
to
that
affect
which
are
reflected
on
page
--
in
the
record
--
133
stating
that,
“i'm
going
to
get
even
with
her,”
and
stating
that
he
intended
to
leave
his
job
at
kellyfield
that
he
was
going
to
kill
her
and
that
he
was
going
to
go
to
mexico.
stating
further
as
reflected
in
the
record
again
page
133
to
a
barmaid
that
he
was
drinking
beer
with,
“you're
going
to
read
about
me
in
the
paper
on
monday.”
he
admitted
that
he
had
his
suitcase
packed
in
a
saloon
and
ready
to
go
as
is
again
reflected
in
the
record
in
page
180.
he
did
in
fact
quit
his
job
as
reflected
in
one
--
page
139
and
thereafter,
on
the
morning
of
the
19th
--
sunday
morning
of
the
19th
he
did
in
fact
stab
his
wife
to
death
with
a
knife
32
times.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
in
the
--
every
portion
of
the
body.
now
this
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
herlinda
alcorta
had
arrived
at
her
home
in
the
company
of
natividad
castilleja.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
at
about
1
o'clock
in
the
morning,
sunday
morning.
now,
in
the
course
of
the
record,
castilleja
said
that
he
had
gone
over
to
his
house
to
see
his
children
at
that
time
on
being
--
alcorta,
excuse
me.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
alcorta,
the
--
the
defendant.
on
the
stand
he
said
that
he
had
gone
over
to
the
house
to
see
his
children
at
that
time
which
is
1
o'clock
in
the
morning.
that
certainly
did
not
coincide
with
the
prior
threats
that
he
had
made
a
month
before
or
two
days
before
--
immediately
before
and
with
his
statement
to
this
barmaid,
“you're
going
to
read
me
about
me
in
the
paper
monday.”
now
i'm
getting
to
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
which
was
before
the
court.
we
have
to
take
also
into
consideration
the
confession
which
was
given
by
the
defendant,
alcorta.
in
which
he
relates
these
prior
threats,
in
which
he
stated
that
he
--
the
reason
that
he
had
killed
her
on
being
asked
the
specific
reason
was
that
she
was
going
out
and
not
taking
care
of
the
kids.
that
she
was
going
out
and
not
taking
care
of
the
kids.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that
she
was
going
out
and
not
taking
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
at
that
particular
time
that
all
that
he
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that
she
was
going
to
dances
but
i'm
going
to
refer
the
court
again
to
this
183
what
he
thought
of
her
dancing.
i
asked
in
this
question
as
to
whether
she
had
--
he
had
seen
his
wife
with
natividad
castilleja.
“you
didn't
have
an
idea
that
that
was
your
wife
dancing
with
castilleja?”
“sure
it
was.
i
wasn't
too
sure.
i
wanted
to
make
everything
sure.”
“you
just
can't
see?”
“you
just
can't
when
you
see
your
wife
and
you
can't
tell
him
with
a
guy.
you
can't
tell
him
why
i'm
going
to
knock
the
block
off
of
him.
i've
got
to
find
out.”
“then
you
weren't
sure
that
was
your
wife
at
that
time?”
”yes,
i
was
sure
it
was
my
wife.
i
saw
it
when
she
climbed
those
steps.”
“then
you
did
know
it
was
you
wife,
he
was
sure
it
was
your
wife.”
“yes.”
“didn't
you?”
and
answer,
“she
was
dancing
with
a
man.”
“why
didn't
you
do
anything
about
it
at
that
time?”
“well,
i
didn't.
well,
i
wasn't
sure
like
i
tell
you.”
“sure
of
what?”
“well,
that
she
was
going
around
with
him
or
anything
like
that.
i
had
to
find
out.”
“she
was
dancing
with
him,”
is
the
question.
answer,
“well,
that
don't
mean
nothing.”
question,
“that
doesn't
mean
anything,
does
it?”
answer,
“no.”
question,
“if
she
was
dancing
with
these
other
fellows
that
doesn't
mean
anything
either?”
answer,
“a
lot
of
times,
i
used
to
take
her
down
to
the
dance
hall
to
dance
because
i
didn't
dance,
i
was
that
good
to
her.”
question,
“the
fact
that
you
dance
with
other
people
occasionally,
that
doesn't
exactly
mean
that
there's
anything
wrong
either,
does
it?”
answer,
“not
exactly,
it
depends.”
question,
“so
when
you
saw
your
wife
dance
with
castilleja,
if
you
saw
her.”
“i
did
saw
her.”
“then
they
weren't
doing
anything
wrong,
were
they?”
“no,
not
dancing.”
“i
see.
well,
did
you
ever
see
them
doing
anything
wrong?”
“well,
not
exactly
except
that
night
when
i
saw
them
there,
the
last
night
i
saw
them
there.”
“and
that's
the
night
you
told
us
in
detail
here
about
in
your
confession.”
“well.”
question,
“is
that
right?”
“and
that's
the
same
night
that
you
failed
to
tell
us
anything
about
castilleja
kissing
your
wife.”
“well,
i
didn't
told
you,
i
just
didn't
remember.”
then,
he
again,
goes
into
the
question
as
to
why
did
you
kill
your
wife?
isn't
that
why
you
killed
your
wife?
because
she
was
kissing
castilleja
up
on
he's
having
--
now
made
the
statement
in
open
court
that
that
was
the
reason.
he
says,
“in
a
way,
yes,
sir.
and
she
wasn't
taking
care
of
the
kids
either.”
now
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
now,
in
the
confession,
i
asked
him
and
in
--
during
the
time
that
he
was
on
the
stand,
i
asked
him
why
didn't
he
tell
us
about
these
things,
about
the
kissing,
and
about
what
he
thought
that
was
going
to
happen
and
what
they
were
going
to
do
and
he
says
if
i
did
--
“i
know
i
didn't
tell
you
if
i
had
told
you,
i
know
that
you
wouldn't
have
put
it
in
there.”
now
that
isn't
specific
question
and
answer
form.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
castilleja.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
and
yet,
you
forgot
to
tell
us
in
that
confession.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
oh,
not
--
this
he
said
--
this
is
his
testimony
in
court,
if
it
please
the
court.
and
not
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
during
the
--
the
taking
of
the
confession.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
and
that's
why
i
inquired
him
as
to
why
he
had
left
that
out.
now
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
irrelevancy
at
that
particular
point
which
i
have
a
--
a
sense
determined
maybe
inadmissible
but
still,
the
purpose
that
i
had
in
mind
at
that
time
was
to
show
the
jury
that
before
his
testimony
with
respect
to
what
he
had
stated
was
not
biased
or
prejudiced
in
any
way
by
the
fact
that
he
may
have
been
in
love
with
her
or
she
in
love
with
him
on
the
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
--
again,
the
specific
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
question
of
the
date,
your
honor,
is
a
question
of
interpretation.
what
is
meant
actually
when
you
ask
a
person,
do
you
have
a
date
with
someone?
whether
that
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well,
again
it's
just
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
word
"date"
as
to
whether
he
had
ever
taken
her
out
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
anywhere.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
if
it
was
admissible
to
begin
with,
certainly
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
only
if
he
knew
of
the
things
which
he
saw
to
corroborate
by
having
that
testimony
come
in.
if
he
had
no
knowledge
of
them,
then
they
could
not
and
would
not
have
affected
his
state
of
mind.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
it
would
but
again,
this
record
does
not
reflect
that
he
ever
said
that
he
knew
that
there
was
anything
wrong
or
even
suspected
that
until
such
time
as
he
took
the
stand
there.
and
when
he
made
those
statements
to
the
court
but
even
at
that,
he
says
he
didn't
think
that
there
was
anything
wrong.there
was
nothing
wrong
in
dancing.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i
had
never
seen
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
anything
wrong.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
in
other
words,
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
wrong
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
but
there
again,
the
question
that
mr.
semaan
called
the
court's
attention
to
with
respect
to
castilleja
denying
that
he
had
kissed
this
woman,
that
question
was
not
even
asked
of
him
by
the
defense
attorney.
there
was
never
any
denial
on
the
part
of
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
of
castilleja.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
i
certainly
did
your
honor
and
i
never
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i
knew
that
it
could
not
come
out
under
our
texas
law
and
it
was
inadmissible
in
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know
it
which
was
reflected
to
me
by
the
confession
which
he
had
given
to
us
that
he
did
not
know
that.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
just
before
i
turned
castilleja
over
for
cross-examination
--
or
on
direct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
castilleja,
yes
i
did.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
no,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
again,
it
goes
to
the
interpretation
of
the
word
love
and
whether
it
--
when
you
say
love,
you
mean
intercourse,
why
then
certainly,
they
would
be
false.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
but
you
have
a
19-year-old
boy
there
with
a
married
woman
with
two
children.
now,
whether
he
was
in
love
with
her
as
he
could
have
and
did
have
intercourse
with
her
and
still,
it's
--
it
was
his
contention
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
the
woman.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that
they
did
not
love
each
other,
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
judge,
there's
nothing
in
there
about
amorous
relations.
that's
--
that's
what
--
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
leave
which
the
court
and
make
and
that
is
that
he
was
not
asked
whether
he
had
sexual
relations
or
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
love
relations.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
we
do
now,
judges.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well,
i
would
suppose
that
they
would,
your
honor.
again,
if
you
attach
the
--
the
intercourse
to
the
love.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
in
the
sense
in
which
you
--
you
use
it.
certainly
the
court
is
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
there
wasn't
a
controversy
as
to
just
what
our
court
did
or
did
not
see
there
on
that
particular
night
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i
would
imagine
so,
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well
it
comes
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
castilleja
had
testified
before
the
defendant
took
the
stand.
when
the
defendant
took
the
stand,
that's
when
he
brought
out
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
that
there
was
kissing
and
what
he
had
purportedly
seen
there
in
the
automobile.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
no.
it
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
certainly
would
not.
i
didn't
particularly
feel
that
the
point
was
important
enough
to
bring
him
back
to
refute
that
or
not
refute
it.
i
felt
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
not
with
the
prior
threats
that
we
had
in
this
case
which
the
record
as
rampant
with,
as
to
what
he
would
have
done
and
i
dare
say
under
the
facts
in
this
case
and
under
the
threats
which
he
had
made
when
he's
--
even
states
in
the
record
that
he
had
no
idea
that
she
was
out
there
with
anyone,
that
the
threats
having
been
made
immediately
before
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
read
in
the
paper
about
him
monday,
long
before
he
went
there,
that
is,
that
same
night
that
he
was
going
there
with
one
purpose
in
mind
that
was
to
kill
her,
whether
he
had
found
her
with
castilleja
or
by
herself.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
it
came
out
this
way.
he
arrived
there
to
leave
the
girl
home.
at
that
time,
his
motor
stopped.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
now,
he
was
right
there
and
he
turned
his
lights
out
so
that
he
could
again
start
his
automobile
at
which
time
she
was
in
the
process
of
getting
out
of
the
automobile.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that
is
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that
was
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
a
part
of
the
writ's
just
stay
immediately
preceeding
these
facts
that
have
just
taken
place
which
were
certainly
relevant
as
to
what
the
parties
were
doing
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that
is
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
was
when
he
brought
her
from
work,
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
he
had
told
me
that
he
had
intercourse
with
this
girl
when
he
brought
her
from
work
in
the
automobile
and
it's
not
in
the
record
anywhere
that
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
and
had
relations
with
her.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i
don't
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
materiality
of
the
question
and
answer
there
at
that
particular
point
is
what
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
not
just
to
drive
her
home
from
work.
the
only
dates
that
he
had
with
her,
was
when
he
brought
her
home
from
work,
“just
when
i
brought
her
from
there.”
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
in
the
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
in
the
automobile,
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
right.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
no.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well,
he
lived
about
a
block
from
her
house.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
thing
that
was
foremost
in
my
mind,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
the
fact
that
alcorta,
not
having
known
about
it,
therefore,
if
they
were
and
certainly
they
were
that
it
was
inadmissible
and
immaterial
to
his
reasons
for
having
killed
her.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
the
dilemma
that
the
state
was
in
at
the
time
if
it
please
the
court
was
had
--
had
we
sought
to
introduce
these
acts
of
intercourse
as
a
motive
so
to
speak
that
we
would
have
been
reversed.
because
again,
the
crux
of
it
being
that
not
having
known
about
him
that
we
could
not
either
attach
him
to
him
as
a
motive
nor
could
we
permit
him
to
come
in
and
use
it
to
mitigate
or
to
minimize
the
offense
that
had
the
state
introduce
that,
it
would
have
been
just
as
inadmissible
for
us.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
again,
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
castilleja.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i
believe
that
i
certainly
could
your
honor
because
again
the
--
the
immateriality
of
it
was
directed
at
his
lack
of
knowledge
of
it,
that
is,
the
immateriality
of
it.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
he
could
--
yes,
he
could
have
corroborated
only
his
kissing,
he
could
have
corroborated
the
dancing
which
he
said
was
the
reason
that
he
killed
her
or
--
or
that
is
that
she
was
kissing
castilleja
and
not
taking
care
of
the
children
and
he
could
not
go
beyond
that
to
corroborate
anything
because
it
was
not
in
his
mind
it
could
not
have
affected
it.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
castilleja
was
never
asked
a
direct
question
by
the
defense
attorney
as
to
what
they
have
been
doing
there.
there
was
no
dispute,
no
particular
issue
made
with
respect
to
the
kissing
or
the
non-kissing
in
the
automobile,
in
fact
accepting
it
as
a
fact
on
the
part
of
the
state
that's
why
we
predicated
the
question
isn't
that
why
you
killed
your
wife
because
she
was
kissing
casitlleja.
that's
when
he
said
yes
and
because
she
was
not
taking
care
of
the
children.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
said
where
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
--
we
didn't
even
have
the
slightest
indication
on
their
part
as
to
the
fact
that
they
even
intended
to
use
anything
on
the
love
making,
in
fact
their
defense
was
directed
at
the
throwing
of
a
rock.
now,
when
castilleja
was
on
the
stand,
he
was
not
asked
about
kissing.
he
was
not
asked
about
hugging.
he
was
asked
a
few,
if
any
questions
by
the
defense
attorney.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
they
--
there
was
testimony
in
there
that
he
had
danced
with
her
immediately
before
and
that
he
had
taken
home
on
that
occasion,
and
other
occasions
from
work
and
from
other
places
where
he
had
met
her.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
as
the
result
of
that
knowledge,
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well
it's
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes
he
was.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well,
again
if
it
please
the
court.
it
goes
to
the
interpretation
of
the
--
the
word
love
as
such.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
under
that
particular
situation
possibly
not
your
honor
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i'm
sorry?
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
we
have
a
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
no,
not
in
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
we
have
a
case
your
honor
in
which
that
situation,
the
role
is
not
certainly
under
that
particular
or
set
of
circumstances
where
--
where
the
state
went
in
as
--
as
seeking
to
attach
a
motive
to
the
defendant
for
having
killed
the
deceased
that
a
certain
--
in
other
words
the
daughter
here
had
conveyed
to
--
the
wife
had
conveyed
to
the
defendant,
her
husband,
that
she
had
been
outraged
and
where
the
state
sought
to
go
in
and
show
more
on
that
to
attach
a
motive
to
him,
the
case
was
reversed
for
that
proposition
there
that
the
man
not
having
known
about
it
that
the
state
was
trying
to
going
in
and
give
the
man
a
motive
for
having
committed
the
homicide
which
the
man
could
not
have
had
because
he
had
no
knowledge
of
those
facts.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
if
the
--
in
my
mind
and
if
under
the
cases
which
i
was
surprised
of
the
time,
your
honor,
if
i
felt
that
the
testimony
was
material
and
admissible,
certainly
it
would
have
gone
in
then.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that
maybe
so.
absolutely.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
under
those
circumstances,
actually.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
not
at
that
particular
point,
your
honor,
on
reflection,
i
questioned
the
admissibility
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
bias
prejudice,
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
it
would
have
but
had
again
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
at
that
particular
point
had
--
that
question
have
been
asked
by
the
state,
daresay
if
that
was
not
there
--
defense
at
that
time,
it
would
have
been
a
rather
merciful
act.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
i
don't
know
what
the
defense
attorney
would
have
objected
to.
the
only
thing
that
we
would
have
to
decide
--
us,
would
be
the
--
the
cases
as
we
read
them
and
indicating
that
attached
to
that
money
motive
which
we
weren't
sure
that
he
knew,
when
in
fact,
in
the
confession
he
gave
no
indication
that
he
knew
that.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
well
--
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
at
that
particular
point
--
i
see,
this
was
in
--
about
four
years.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
yes.
i
had
been
in
the
district
attorney's
office
about
four
years.
i
had
there
been
prosecuting,
i
believe,
about
two
years.
mr.
roy
r.
barrera
1951.
i
would
like
to
with
the
court's
permission
refer
the
balance
of
my
time
to
my
co-counsel
here.
