justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
semaan,
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
requirement
that
you
have
to
establish
before
this
court
and
all
that
they
have
is
the
jury
for
the
particular
(inaudible)
what
do
you
think
you
have
to
--
what
is
the
burden?
justice
felix
frankfurter
remedy
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
last
word,
is
the
keyword,
isn't
it?
last
two
words.
do
we
have
to
purge
your
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
the
burden
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
participation
of
the
prosecution
in
texas,
the
conscious
participation
in
having
purged
testimony
given
by
a
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
the
burden
that
you
have
to
establish.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
now
to
assume
that
one
agrees
with
that,
you
can
take
for
granted
that
mooney
and
holohan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
in
the
record
establishes
--
that
brings
you
within
mooney
and
holohan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
not
the
fact
that
the
witness
lied,
that
it
meant
perjury,
that
is
an
monopoly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it's
the
district
attorney
or
the
prosecutor
or
whatever
he
is
called
in
perfect
good
faith
puts
on
a
witness
and
subsequently
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
witness
himself
committed
perjury,
you
think
that's
the
reason
--
the
reason
for
them
to
quote
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
burden
that
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
have
to
undertake
here,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
agreement
--
did
the
state
agree
that
--
that
the
--
assuming
there
was
perjury
--
assuming
there
was
perjury,
is
it
agreed
by
the
state
that
the
prosecutor
will
just
pause
there
in
the
submission
of
the
perjury
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
is
it
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
right
now
what
it
is
that
we
have
before
us
which
doesn't
raise
that
the
disputed
question
of
facts
that
in
fact
the
prosecutor
combined
with
the
--
even
you
regard
it
as
perjurious
witnesses
to
give
further
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
that
that
must
be
established
not
here
but
by
the
record
that
comes
here,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
semaan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
this
correctly.
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
and
other
questions,
you
have
dealt
with
the
problem,
you
have
dealt
with
testimonies
of
which
doesn't
reveal
or
it
did
not
hear,
in
which
the
district
attorney
claimed
was
not
admissible,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
status
born
out
of
the
case
of
your
problems
in
your
case.
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
the
colloquy,
the
question
and
answer
was
two-way
and
set
forth
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
the
questions
and
answers,
the
colloquy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
between
mr.
barrera
and
the
witness
set
forth
in
presiding
judge
morrison
concurring
opinion
on
page
2
and
3
of
your
brief.i
want
to
ask
you
whether
there
is
any
controversy
that
those
questions
and
the
answer
thereto
of
questions
that
mr.
barrera
did
ask
on
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
2
and
3
of
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assume
that's
the
correct
transcript
of
the
record
but
i
haven't
got
it
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
those
question
and
the
answers
given
were
given
by
mr.
barrera
--
were
questions
by
mr.
barrera
on
direct
examination
of
the
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
questions
presumably
since
he
put
them,
he
thought
were
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
answers
to
those
questions
--
my
next
question
is
whether
the
answers
to
those
questions
by
the
witness
were
in
fact
necessarily
untruthful
answers
in
view
of
the
disclosures
that
were
not
made
regarding
his
relation
with
the
woman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
--
whether
those
answers
were
not
necessarily
untruthful
in
light
of
the
knowledge
which
has
come
to
mr.
barrera
which
he
thought,
for
one
reason
or
the
other,
for
all
i
know
a
good
reason
but
not
be
admitted
namely,
his
relations
with
--
with
the
wife,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
don't
care
what
you're
examining,
just
stick
to
my
question.
i
want
to
know
whether
the
prosecutor
gave
questions
--
put
questions
which
presumably
he
thought
were
relevant
as
the
witness
put
to
him
and
to
which
he
got
answers
that
he
must
have
known
were
untruthful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
then,
if
that
is
so,
then
it
is
another
fact
that
on
this
record
on
the
basis
of
your
answers
to
me
that
the
prosecutor
sat
by
silently
while
he
elicited
what
he
knew
to
have
been
untruthful
answers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
didn't
you
ask
that
on
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
not
answers
to
questions
knowingly
put
--
by
the
district
attorney,
presumably,
in
order
to
establish
your
case
on
with
your
cross-examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying,
what
you're
now
--
and
use
the
answers
you've
got.
what
i
call
your
attention
to
is,
what
the
district
attorney
elicited
by
his
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
merely
proved
that
he
had
this
knowledge
but
he
didn't
bring
out
--
he
didn't
bring
out
that
information
at
the
trial
of
what
judge
morrison
quotes,
he
did
bring
out
at
the
trial.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
if
these
questions
and
answer
was
set
forth
by
your
presiding
judge
morrison,
at
what
stage
--
where
in
the
record
did
you
ask
these
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
as
before
alcorta
--
alcorta
accepted
to
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
worked
with
him
as
a
witness,
did
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
questions
were
elicited
by
you
on
the
direct
examination
of
a
witness
for
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
answers
that
he
gave
you,
if
i
heard
right
a
minute
ago,
that
you
knew
were
not
true,
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
--
you
were
saying
that
--
that
the
knowledge
that
you
had
of
castilleja's
relations
with
the
woman
that
he's
going
to
(inaudible)
“were
you
in
love
with
her?”
“no.”
“was
she
in
love
with
you?”
“have
you
ever
talked
about
love?”
“had
you
ever
had
any
dates
with
her
other
than
to
take
her
home?”
you
would
say
that
they
were
not
false
in
light
of
the
knowledge
that
you
have
of
his
relations
with
the
woman?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
should
have.
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
these
questions
can
be
answered
--
just
were
made
be
to
be
perhaps.
did
they
or
did
they
not
leave
the
minds
of
the
jury
insofar
as
this
witness
concerned
and
he
is
the
one
who
would
know
more
about
it
than
anybody
else,
that
his
relation
with
this
woman
were
innocent
relationship?
isn't
that
the
sum
total?
that
they
had
known
that
they
were
--
that
there
--
that
there
was
no
amorous
relation
between
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
he
says
very
well
and
i
will
submit
that
what
love
is
in
here,
has
many
meanings
but
will
you
be
good
enough
to
answer
the
question
whether
the
questions
and
answers
they're
proposing
by
judge
morrison,
did
they
or
did
they
not?
assume
you're
tendering
him
as
--
as
a
witness
tell
the
jury
on
his
testimony.
he
tells
the
jury
he
did
not
have
amorous
relation
with
this
woman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
not.
but
what
--
what
was
conveyed
to
those
--
have
you
got
women
on
the
jury
down
there?
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
--
when
the
trial
was
on,
what
was
left
in
the
minds
of
those
12
people
sitting
on
the
jury
box
that
his
relations
with
this
woman
were
what
in
the
point
of
view
is
sexual
immorality
who
are
innocent,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
now
deciding
whether
intercourse
or
it
implies
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
roles
and
expression
of
the
kind
of
feeling
that
we
call
love.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
was
it
not
the
fact
that
the
impression
was
left
or
was
bound
to
be
left
that
his
relations
were
innocent
in
the
sense
in
which
i
use
the
word
innocence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
crucial
sense
in
this
controversy
isn't
it,
namely,
that
he
did
not
have
relations
with
a
woman
calculated
to
stir
the
passion
of
a
husband.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i'm
--
i
must
press
you
to
ask,
what
--
what
the
--
what
work
of
these
question
was
and
what
it
is
that
the
questions
and
the
answers
that
the
questions
elicited.
what
it
is
that
was
left
in
the
minds
of
the
jurors.
was
it
or
was
it
not
with
his
relation
with
his
wife
were
innocent
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barrera,
if
you
put
to
your
mind
the
difficulty
with
this
case
differently
i
see
it
that's
your
problem.
i
quite
understand
your
--
the
bigger
problem
of
the
issue
namely,
that
fact
is
not
known
to
a
person
who
commits
homicide
are
not
admissible
to
prove
that
the
homicide
is
murder.
if
he
didn't
know
it,
the
argument
is
in
those
cases
if
he
could
--
he
couldn't
say
that
he
was
in
play
as
to
that
probability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
result
of
that
note
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
knowledge
was
--
if
he
didn't
have
knowledge,
you
can't
predicate
a
--
a
motion
based
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
understand
that,
but
the
difficulty
here
is
that
castilleja
was
(inaudible)
you
put
him
on
the
stand
before
you
knew
about
what
--
of
course
to
be
of
what's
certain.
certainly
before
you
do
what
he's
going
to
--
nothing
that
came
out
of
his
mouth
on
the
record,
that
came
out
as
a
result
of
your
questioning.
and
you
asked
him
questions
which
are
repeated,
could
have
left
no
other
impression
on
the
jury's
mind
than
the
man
in
the
room
the
victim
was
involved
had
innocence,
that
it
was
only
platonic
relations,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
that
you
knew
that
the
relation
has
not
been
platonic
you
tended
the
witness,
you
got
him
to
testify
and
therefore
affect
the
mind
of
the
jury
that
the
relation
was
one
thing,
what
you
knew
very
well
at
the
time,
that
was
something
to
be
off.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
all
the
--
all
the
problems
that
arise
out
of
the
irrelevant
--
of
his
none-knowledge
or
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
do
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
that
he
had
resolved
to
kill
her
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
et
cetera.
already
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue.
i
put
it
to
your
view.
all
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
fact
that
you
put
a
witness
of
yours
down
the
witness
stand
and
got
him
to
testify
for
all
practical
purposes
to
the
jury
listening
to
this
man
you
knew
he
must
have
been
interested
or
effective
to
the
defendant
himself.
he
was
the
most
important
witness,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
questions
and
answer
with
judge
morrison
that
set
forth
in
his
opinion
are
exactly
the
same
as
though
you'd
turned
this
(inaudible)
castilleja.
did
you
not
on
your
relations
with
this
woman
innocent
and
he
would've
said
yes,
that's
not
the
issue
with
this
question
and
answers
amount
to.
that
isn't
the
question
you
put.
you
didn't
ask
him
in
those
words
but
the
question
you
asked
and
then
answer
he
gave
add
up
to
saying
“my
relation
to
this
woman
was
--”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
the
jury
got,
although,
at
that
time
you
knew,
the
opposite
was
the
truth,
was
that
a
clear
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
take
the
whole
sum
total,
one
question
after
another
calculated
could
it
be
any
other
impression
could
the
jury
hearing
that
have
drawn
any
other
possible
interest
except
that
their
relation
was
not
what
we
had
then,
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
of,
apart
from
the
interpretation
of
this
colloquy
--
the
colloquy
between
mr.
barrera
and
the
witness
as
you
referred
to
(inaudible),
are
you
submitting
to
the
court
any
questions
about
local
texas
law,
which
concludes
relief
by
this
court
and
this
record
assuming
the
court
would
take
a
view
contrary
to
your
own
on
the
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is,
there
are
--
if
this
court,
is
debarred
from
dealing
with
the
situation
assuming
the
claim
of
misconduct
or
unfair
conduct
of
the
state,
that
this
court
is
debarred
from
dealing
with
the
situation
because
under
the
texas
law
not
yet
availed
of
there
is
a
mean
of
rectifying
this
under
pressure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
take
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
mooney
v.
holohan
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
upon
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
more
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
are
no
--
there's
no
other
relief
assuming
he's
entitled
to
a
relief
that
he
can
get
from
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
name
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
second
aspect
of
mooney
against
holohan
namely
and
this
court
said,
although
a
state
can't
do
what
was
done
in
the
mooney
case.
this
court
had
the
case
back
and
said
you
get
your
relief
in
--
from
texas
and
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
--
there's
no
such
problem
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
they
ordered
texas
to
close.
justice
felix
frankfurter
california
contended
both.
but
assuming
you're
against
them
and
you
say
i
just
want
to
know
whether
you
make
no
plain
deal
about
--
here's
the
situation
of
all
the
judicial
doors
of
texas
have
closed.
and
you
say
it
should
be
a
basis
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
due
process
was
violated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can
talk
about
anything
except
the
argument
that
you
and
mr.
barrera
made
on
his
so-called
--
