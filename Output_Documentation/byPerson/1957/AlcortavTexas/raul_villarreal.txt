mr.
raul
villarreal
i
might
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honor
that
we
contend
here
as
a
size
of
the
evidence
that
there's
--
there's
no
disputed
issue
of
fact.
one,
the
prosecutor
admitted
before
the
court
and
before
all
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
that
he
told
a
man
that
the
evidence
was
inadmissible,
that
--
and
further,
that
he
knew
about
the
intercourse
and
further,
it's
a
public
record
that
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
the
prosecution
--
prosecution
witness.
now,
the
--
the
issue
is
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
there
suppression
of
vital
and
material
evidence
beneficial
to
the
defendant
and
they
claim
they
make
the
attempt
to
even
make
the
case
stronger
for
the
defendant.
they
say,
he
didn't
even
know
about
it.
now,
i
want
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
knew
what,
the
defendant
knowing
about
this,
way
before
the
case
came
to
trial.
when
he
took
the
statement
from
natividad
castilleja,
that
was
about
two
weeks
to
10
days
according
to
his
testimony
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
after
he
took
the
statement
from
alcorta,
he
took
the
statement
from
castilleja.
and
on
page
128,
on
128
of
the
transcript,
the
last
--
the
paragraph
of
the
statement
given
to
mr.
barrera
personally
because
he
--
he
claims
that
he
admitted
under
writ
and
he
admits
now
that
he
was
there
at
the
time
of
the
statement
was
given
and
he
says
here
on
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph,
one
thing
i
went
with,
that's
castilleja
talking
to
mr.
barrera,
the
prosecutor,
when
the
man
first
walked
to
the
car,
that
is
when
he
ran
to
get
in
the
car.
he
cursed
herlinda,
he
said
and
then
the
words
in
spanish
(inaudible),
yet
that
the
scale
which
means
literally,
(inaudible).
now,
i've
caught
you.
now
the
--
notice
the
interpretation
given
by
castilleja,
you
bitch,
i
caught
you
leaving
out
the
word
"now".
now,
going
back
to
the
cross
examination
of
mr.
barrera,
i
think
justice
warren
addressed
that
issue
clearly
when
he
interrogated
mr.
barrera
about
the
--
the
cross
examination
when
alcorta
divulged
that
he
knew
or
suspected
and
he
caught
him
kissing
and
he
felt
and
believed
at
that
particular
time
that
they
were
making
love
or
having
a
date
up
and
that
compounded
with
the
fact
that
alcorta
had
made
a
statement
corroborating
the
belief
that
he
had
caught
her.
now,
this
statement
was
never
introduced
in
evidence.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
testimony
itself,
the
transcript
of
page
155,
it
was
sort
of
watered
down.
the
testimony
was
given
as
castilleja
said,
"i
caught
you."
he
didn't
say
the
--
the
profanity,
he
didn't
say,
“now.”
i
believe
that
--
that
it
could
have
very
well
given
--
taken
home
the
message
to
mr.
barrera
that
then
he
could've
realized
that
alcorta
knew
about
this
intercourse
and
at
that
time,
the
issue
was
very
material
as
the
issue
of
murder
without
malice
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
for
that
reason,
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
case.
thank
you.
