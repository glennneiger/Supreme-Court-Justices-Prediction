if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
one
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas.
the
decision
sought
to
be
reviewed
as
a
denial
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
of
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
seeking
the
release
of
the
petitioner
from
custody
of
the
warden
of
the
state
penitentiary
of
texas
for
the
reason
that
his
conviction
is
void
and
that
it
was
based
on
perjury
and
suppressed
evidence.
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
invoked
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
questions
are,
have
the
provisions
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
been
violated
or
has
an
accused
been
afford
--
afforded
a
fair
and
partial
trial
where
(1)
the
prosecutor
advised
and
encouraged
the
only
eye
witness
to
the
killing
who
was
also
the
state's
main
witness
to
deny
and
not
to
admit
nor
volunteer
facts
favorable
to
the
defendant,
which
facts
would
have
mitigated
his
punishment
at
the
hands
of
the
jury.
and
further,
where
the
witness,
having
received
the
foregoing
advise
from
the
prosecutor,
committed
perjury
regarding
matters
vital
and
material
to
the
issues
of
guilt
or
punishment.
and
further,
where
the
prosecutor
before
the
trial
had
begun,
received
certain
information
vital
and
material
to
the
issues
of
guilt
or
punishment
favorable
to
the
defendant
but
unknown
to
the
defendant
that
such
evidence
was
in
possession
of
the
prosecution,
failed
and
refused
to
apprise
the
court,
the
defendant
or
the
defendant's
attorney
of
the
same
so
that
such
evidence
would
be
available
to
the
defendant.
but
instead,
having
advised
the
defendant
--
the
witness
to
deny
such
facts,
the
prosecutor
then
proceeded
to
question
the
witness
regarding
these
facts,
received
answers
known
to
the
prosecutor
to
be
untrue,
sat
mute
and
neither
informed
the
court
nor
the
defendant
that
the
testimony
of
the
witness
was
false.
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
state
of
texas,
while
putting
on
its
main
case,
called
to
the
witness
stand
one
natividad
castilleja,
and
after
eliciting
testimony
from
him
regarding
the
stabbing
of
the
wife
of
the
defendant,
herlinda
--
herlinda
alcorta,
got
from
him
testimony
that
he
was
--
the
girl
meant
nothing
to
him
that
she
was
a
friend
of
his
sister's,
that
he
had
met
her
at
his
sister's
home,
that
his
sister
made
statements
to
him
to
the
effect
that
this
girl
is
a
friend
of
mine,
she
lives
near
you
and
she
works
near
you
and
i'll
appreciate
it
if
you'll
give
her
a
ride
home
from
time
to
time.
after
bringing
out
that
testimony
and
the
testimony
regarding
the
killing,
this
further
testimony
was
elicited
from
that
witness

by
mr.

“she's

now,
other
than
the
time
you
saw
or
met
herlinda
alcorta
at
your
sister's
house,
did
you
ever
see
her
on
other
occasions?”
answer,
“well,
i
gave
her
about

i
gave
her
a

question,
“you
gave
her
a
ride
about
two
times?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.”
“from
where
to
where?”
answer,
“from
where
she
was
working
to
her
house.”
and
then
again,
“natividad
were
you
in
love
with
herlinda?”
answer,
“no.”
“was
she
in
love
with
you?”
“had
you
ever
talked
about

“no.”
“had
you
ever
had
any

other
than
to
take
her
home?”
“no.
well,
just
when
i
brought
her
from
there.”
question,
“just
when
you
brought
her
from
work?”
answer,
“yes.”
the
defendant
then
took
the
witness
stand
in
his
own
defense
after
the
state
addressed
it
and
testified
about
his
wife's
misconduct
with
several
men
including
this
witness,
castilleja.
he
test
about
--
testified
about
her
neglect
to
the
children
and
the
circumstances
under
which
he
found
her
immediately
before
the
stabbing.
and
he
testified
as
to
how
all
this
affected
him
in
his
state
or
condition
of
mind
at
the
type
--
at
the
time
of
the
stabbing
and
the
--
i'd
like
at
this
point
to
read
just
a
few
excerpts
from
his
testimony
on
those
matters.
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
30
of
our
brief.
“from
there
i
went
to
see
my
wife.”
now,
he's
testifying
--
testifying
may
i
explain
at
this
poin,
with
regard
to
a
matter
of
time
just
a
few
minutes
before
the
stabbing.
“from
there
i
went
to
see
my
wife
but
i
didn't
see
my
wife
alone
or
in
the
house
or
getting
in
from
work
or
anything
like
that.
she
was
with
another
man
in
a

although
he
was
here
saying
it
was
the
only
time
he
had
seen
her.

or
six

from

mr.
fred
a.
semaan
although
he
was
here
and
saying
it
was
the
only
time
he
had
seen
her,
“i
have
seen
him
several
times
in
the
radio
club
dancing
and
she
was
with
that
same
fellow
and
not
only
with
that
same
fellow
but
with
many
others
that
i
don't
know
the
names
of.
that's
when
i
saw
her
in
that
place.
i
didn't
really
have
the
intentions,
that
like,
mr.
barrera,
has
got
in
the
statement,
that
i
have
decided
to
kill
her
right
there.
i
didn't
have
those
intensions.
i
only
went
to
the
car
and
this
guy
started
--
well
getting
mad
and
all
that.
well,
i
never
did
carry
a
knife,
either,
because
i
had
turned
my
job
in
and
i
was
going
away.”
further
down,
“when
i
was
getting
to
the
car,”
this
is
on
page
31.
“when
i
turned
the
corner
i
saw
my
wife
was
kissing
with
this
fellow.
i
didn't
know
him
then,
i
saw
him
dancing
at
the
radio
club
up
there.
she
had
so
many
that
i
don't
remember
their
names.
i
wouldn't
be
asking
for
that.
i
just
saw
her
and
that's
all.
and
i
saw
them
and
they
were
kissing
and
i
thought
they
were
having
a
date
up
or
something.
she
had
the
door
open,
yes,
but
i
had
a
feeling
that
something
else
was
going
to
happen
then,
not
only
that
they
were
kissing
and
all
that
but
something
else.
if
i
had
a
camera
and
waited
a
little
longer,
it
would
have
been
a
different
story
than
what
they
claim
up
here
now.”
and
then
on
page
32
or
35
at
the
top
of
the
page,
“i
stabbed
her.
i
mean,
i
was
just
all
carried
away
when
i
saw
her
with
that
guy
and
all
of
that.
i
was
drunk.
you
get
a
man
like
that
to
think
of
everything
like
that
and
you
get
carried
away
and
mad.”
and
again
on
page
37,
“like
i
told
you,
if
i
had
a
camera
and
waited
a
little
longer,
it
would
have
been
a
different
story.
i
would
have
brought
the
picture
and
showed
it
to
you.”
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
under
texas
law,
murder
is
divided,
so
to
speak,
into
two
categories,
murder
with
malice
which
is
punishable
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
from
two
years
to
life
or
death
in
electric
chair.
included
in
that
is
the
offense
of
murder
without
malice.the
punishment
for
that
is
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
from
two
years
to
life
and
no
more.
and
on
page
6
of
our
brief
referring
to
article
1257b
penal
code
of
the
state
of
texas
and
all
the
cases
tried
under
the
provisions
of
this
act,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
court
to
define
malice
or
forethought
and
shall
apply
that
term
by
appropriate
charge
to
the
facts
in
the
case
and
shall
instruct
the
jury
that
unless
they
find
from
all
the
facts,
in
all
the
circumstances
and
evidence
that
the
jury
believes
the
defendant
was
prompted
and
acted
with
his
malice
or
forethought
they
cannot
assess
his
punishment
at
a
period
of
longer
than
five
years.
the
following
article
defines
murder
without
malice.
murder
without
malice
is
a
voluntary
homicide
committed
without
justification
or
excuse
under
the
immediate
influence
of
a
sudden
passion
arising
from
an
adequate
cause
by
which
is
meant
such
cause
is
what
commonly
produced
the
degree
of
anger,
rage,
resentment
or
terror
and
a
person
of
ordinary
temper
sufficient
to
render
the
mind
incapable
of
cool
reflection
and
in
connection
with
that
i
think
we
should
make
some
reference
at
this
point
to
article
1257a
on
the
preceding
page,
page
5.
in
all
prosecutions
for
a
felonious
homicide,
the
state
or
the
defendant
shall
be
permitted
to
offer
testimony
as
to
all
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
killing
and
the
previous
relationship
existing
between
the
accused
and
the
deceased,
together
with
all
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
going
to
show
the
condition
of
the
mind
of
the
accused
at
the
time
of
the
homicide
which
may
be
considered
by
the
jury
in
determining
the
punishment
to
be
assessed
and
then
it
goes
on
to
include
the
suspended
sentence
act
or
law
rather.
now,
our
position
is
this
that
the
defendant
under
article
1257a
certainly
had
the
right
to
tell
and
to
show
the
jury,
the
circumstances
under
which
he
found
his
wife.
the
suspicions
that
he
had
had
about
her
conduct
for
sometime,
suspicions
that
were
confirmed
when
he
woke
up
and
found
her
under
the
circumstances,
he
said
he
did.
and
since
he
had
that
right,
he
had
the
further
right
to
be
corroborative
in
his
testimony
regarding
his
state
of
mind
by
the
honest
and
the
unpurged
testimony
of
the
witness,
natividad
castilleja,
who,
had
he
told
the
truth
would
have
corroborated
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
to
the
extent
that
the
jury,
undoubtedly,
in
my
mind
would
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
this
man
says
is
true,
the
conditions
under
which
he
found
his
wife
are
true
and
they
are
conditions
that
probably
would
render
the
mind
of
a
man
incapable
of
cool
reflection
and
a
killing
under
those
circumstances
is
murder
without
malice
and
the
punishment
cannot
be
more
than
five
years.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
what
offenses
are
committed.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
that
would
be
murder
without
malice.
the
fact
that
castilleja's
testimony
didn't
corroborate
but
contradicted
the
testimony
of
alcorta,
damaged
him
i
think
more
than
anything
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
brought
about
the
death
penalty
at
the
hands
of
the
jury.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
think
i've
got
to
show
that
i've
exhausted
all
my
remedies
in
the
state
courts
that
we
have
no
remedy
down
there.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
for
the
--
for
the
setting
aside
of
the
conviction,
a
conviction
that
was
based
on
thought,
because
it
is
based
on
purged
testimonies.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
and
the
supression
of
evidence.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
and
certainly
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
--
under
the
only
cases
we
have
cited
amounts
to
a
fundamental
unfairness.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
it
begins
there.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
the
fact
that
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
well,
in
some
cases
it
could
be,
however,
in
this
case
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
--
i
see
what
you
mean
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
no,
sir.
i
think
they've
got
to
go
one
step
further
and
--
and
show
that
the
district
attorney
or
the
prosecutor
knew
that
perjury
was
being
committed
and
either
condoned
it,
encouraged
it
or
sat
mute
and
did
nothing
about
it.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
believe.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
sir,
suppression.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
well,
i
--
i
think
i'll
show
a
little
further
that
the
witness,
castilleja,
made
a
statement
to
the
district
attorney,
i
remember
his
--
i
remember
at
of
his
office
the
day
after
the
killing,
that
he
told
them
of
his
true
relationship
with
the
deceased.
he
said
i've
been
going
with
her
for
several
months
and
i've
had
intercourse
with
her
five
or
six
times.
the
prosecutor
took
the
position
that,
well
that's
not
admissible,
so
i'm
going
to
advise
him
not
to
tell
about
that,
don't
volunteer
it
and
deny
it
because
it's
not
admissible.but
if
you're
asked
anything,
answer
truthfully.
then
the
prosecutor
in
the
trial
of
the
case
asked
these
questions
regarding
the
relationship
that
existed
between
the
witness,
castilleja
and
the
dead
girl
knowing
that
there
had
been
acts
of
intercourse,
having
been
told
by
the
witness
and
sat
mute
and
did
nothing
and
said
nothing
to
no
one.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
no,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
sir.
give
me
just
a
minute
and
i'll
find
that,
your
honor.
on
page
72
of
the
printed
record,
the
prosecutor
at
this
point
is
testifying
before
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
and
a
hearing
for
commutation.
he
was
asked
this
question
by
one
of
the
attorneys
for
the
petitioner,
“did

you
if
you
didn't

did
not

answer,
“whether
he
asked
the
question?”
question,
“yes.”
answer,
“yes,
and
did
you
not
give
this
answer?”
“yes,
i
told
him
it
was
not
admissible
unless
brought
up
by
the
defense.”
“did
you
give
that
answer?”
answer,
“that's
not
the
full
answer
i
gave
him.”
question,
“did
you
give
that
much
of
it?”
answer,
“yes
i
did
give
that
much
of
it.
yes,
i
did
that
--
that
much
of
it.”
“alright,
now
go
on
further.
alright
now,
did
you
go
on
further
then
and
say
that
the
defense
had
never
introduced
the
question
of
ms.
alcorta's
infidelity
and
if
they
had
you
would
object
it?”
answer,
“yes
sir.”
“you
said
that?”
“that's
correct.”
“but
you
did
tell
mr.
garcia
that
you
had
advised
castilleja,
the
witness,
that
he
did
not
have
to
testify
about
his
relations
with
herlinda
alcorta
because
in
your
opinion
it
was
not
admissible.”
now,
on
another
occasion,
the
same
prosecutor,
mr.
barrera
wrote
a
letter
to
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
which
was

into

in
the
hearing
on
the

of
the
printed
record,
however,
i
refer
now
to
the
top
of

now,
this
is
the
prosecutor
and
an
affidavit
to
the
board
of
pardon
and

speaking
of
the
taking
of
the
statement
from

after
the
killing.
he
verified
that
statements
contained
there
were
true.
there
was
nothing
in
the
statement
with
respect
to
his
ever
having
had
sexual
intercourse
with
the
deceased,
herlinda
alcorta.
pete
torres
and
i
pressed
him
further
and
stronger
about
prior
sexual
relations
with
the
deceased
in
this
case
and
after
a
short
time
he
finally
admitted
to
mr.
torres
in
that
--
that
he
had
sexual
intercourse
with
her
approximately
four
or
five
times,
the
last
time
being
--
having
occurred
approximately
one
or
two
months
before
the
night
of
the
homicide.
he
denied
empathically
that
there'd
any
misconduct
on
his
part
--
on
his
or
her
part
on
the
night
of
the
homicide.
then
further
down,
the
letter
is
--
is
a
very
long
one
and
--
and
consists
of
some
several
pages
even
in
this
printed
record,
but
in
this
letter
he
goes
on
to
explain
that
i
told
him
that
if
anyone
asked
him
about
that
to
deny
it
because
in
my
opinion,
it's
not
admissible.
if
you're
asked
about
it,
don't
volunteer
and
if
you're
asked
about
it,
deny
it
but
then
he
ends
every
statement
with
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
--
but
tell
the
truth
whatever
you
say.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
at
that
time
he
asked
me
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
115
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
at
that
time
he
asked
me
and
mr.
torres
what
he
should
do
--
that
is
in
a
printed
record
that's
what
he
said.
what
he
should
do
or
say
if
someone
wanted
a
statement
from
him
to
which
i
answered
that
he
could
give
them
a
statement
if
he
wanted
to
but
certainly
he
did
not
have
--
have
to.
needless
to
say
--
say,
i
told
him
that
i'd
prefer
that
he
did
not,
in
view
of
my
past
experience
with
defense
attorneys
taking
statements
from
the
witness
--
witnesses
such
as
the
--
such
as
this
filed
to
a
state
case
and
who
by
force
as
certainly
we'll
know
a
little
further
on.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
sir,
bear
in
mind,
however,
your
honor
that
this
is
the
prosecutor
accused
of
what
he's
being
accused
of
making
an
affidavit
to
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
after
all
this
happened.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
sir.
there's
nothing
true
about
it.
that's
for
the
court
to
decide
and
he
says
that's
for
me
to
decide
at
the
time
i
ask
the
question.
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
i
think
it
did.
castilleja
in
his
statement
said
this
about
what
he
was
told
by
mr.
torres
and
mr.
barrera.
on
page
121
of
the
record,
beginning
at
121,
on
page
123
or
at
the
bottom
of
122,
“i
want
to
be
clear
about
this
that
torres,
this
is
castilleja
speaking.”
torres
never
actually
told
me
to
deny
that
i
had
intercourse
with
herlinda
alcorta,
what
he
told
me
was
this,
“if
you
want
to
say
it
go
on
and
say
it,
but
if
you
don't
want
to
say
it
then
don't
say
it.”
he
was
talking
about
the
testimony
that
i
was
to
give
when
i
was
told
there's
a
witness
in
court.”
i
had
already
admitted
to
torres
that
i
had
intercourse
with
herlinda
alcorta
and
he
knew
that
i
had.
what
i
am
saying
now
is
regarding
what
i
was
to
say
when
i
took
the
witness
stand.”
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
think
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
think
that's
in
keeping
with
his
attitude
which
is
more
clearly
reflected
in
the
--
let
me
refer
to
the
brief
here
--
on
page
16
of
the
brief.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
would
it
not
have
been
the
honorable
and
honest
thing
to
do,
mr.
barrera,
if
you
wanted
to
see
that
this
man
had
a
fair
and
impartial
trial,
when
you
heard
those
answers
knowing
that
the
man
had
had
intercourse
with
her
to
notify
the
judge
has
to
the
true
answers
of
the
true
facts.
answer,
“mr.
seeman,
the
honorable
thing
is
never
to
approach
the
bench
with
the
facts
of
the
case
as
i
have
often
seen
it
done
to
try
to
influence
the
judge
one
way
another.”
question,
“you
never
took
it
upon
yourself
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
occasion
never
rules,
you
never
felt
it
was
your
duty
or
took
it
upon
yourself
to
tell
the
judge
about
that
either
before
the
trial
or
after
the
trial,
either
before
this
testimony
was
elicited
or
after
it
--
after
it
was
elicited
--
elicited,
did
you
mr.
barrera?
answer,
“not
anymore
that
so
that
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
him
about
the
character
of
the
defendant,
alvaro
alcorta,
or
not
more
than
the
misconduct
of
alvaro
alcorta
knowing
myself
whether
it
is
inadmissible
to
begin
with.
it
was
not
out
of
the
ordinary
to
instruct
any
witness
not
to
volunteer
any
information
and
--
and
to
answer
only
the
questions
asked
of
him
truthfully.”
“did
you
ever
take
it
upon
yourself,
mr.
barrera
either
before
the
trial
or
after
the
trial
or
before
this
testimony
was
elicited,
this
testimony
i
have
just
read
you
and
you
--
read
to
you
and
you
have
acknowledged
either
before
it
was
elicited
or
after
it
was
elicited?
did
you
take
it
upon
yourself
or
a
feel
of
duty
to
inform
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
of
the
true
facts
regarding
the
relationship
between
herlinda
alcorta
and
natividad
castilleja?”
“not
anymore
than
i
would
feel
it
was
if
--
if
there
was
a
duty
upon
him
to
tell
me
what
the
defendant
may
have
told
him
or
the
true
facts
of
the
killing
as
it
might
have
occurred
as
he
knows
it.”
the
point
is
this,
from
my
reading
and
my
interpretation
of
the
facts
in
the
record
in
this
case,
the
testimony
of
the
prosecutor
barrera
and
the
hearing
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
the
--
the
testimony
of
the
prosecutor
barrera
and
the
hearing
before
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
on
commutation,
the
--
the
affidavit
of
the
--
of
the
witness,
castilleja.
all
those
things
lead
me
to
believe
and
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
sincerely
feel
that
there
was
at
least
some
subornation
of
perjury
where
he
tells
him,
“you
don't
have
to
say
this
or
that
or
the
other
unless
you
want
to.”
but
he
always
asked
if
you
--
if
you
are
asked
answer
truthfully.
then
when
he
on
direct
examination,
after
taking
this
position
that
those
questions
are
not
--
are
not
admissible,
you
can't
go
into
them
and
if
you
do
i'm
going
to
object
as
to
the
questions
regarding
the
relationship
himself
before
the
defendant
has
ever
taken
the
stand,
before
he's
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
any
kind
of
defense,
ask
those
question
and
get
answers
that
he
knows
are
not
true
and
say
it's
mute.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
sir.
mr.
fred

semaan
of
commutation.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
the
district
attorney.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
that
mr.
barrera
comes
very
close
to
that
when
he
testifies.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
in
this
hearing.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
beginning
on
page
71
of
the
record
where
i
think
that
part
is
a
little
further
on.
no,
that's
wrong.
on
page
72,
that's
not
--
we're
speaking
--
roy
barrera
is
on
the
witness
stand
and
the
hearing
on
the
writ
and
he's
being
asked
questions
regarding
his
testimony
before
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles.
“did
gus
garcia
ask
you
this
question
if
--
if
you
did
not
in
fact
tell
castilleja
that
he
--
that
he
did
not
have
to
testify
about
his
relations
with
herlinda
alcorta.”
answer,
“whether
he
asked
the
question?”
question,
“yes.”
answer,
“yes.”
“and
did
you
not
give
him
this
answer?”
“yes,
i
told
him
that
it
is
not
admissible
unless
brought
up
by
the
defense.”
“did
you
give
him
that
answer?”
answer,
“that's
not
the
full
answer
i
gave.”
question,
“did
you
give
that
much
of
it?”
answer,
“yes,
i
did.”
question,
“alright
now,
did
you
go
further
then
and
say
that
the
defense
had
never
introduced
the
question
of
ms.
alcorta's
infidelity
and
if
they
had,
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
objected
to
it
anyway?”
answer,
“yes
sir.”
question,
“you
said
that?”
answer,
“that's
correct.”
but
you
--
question,
“but
you
did
tell
mr.
garcia
that
you
had
advised
castilleja
that
he
did
not
have
to
testify
about
his
relations
with
ms.
alcorta,
herlinda
alcorta,
because
in
your
opinion
it
was
not
admissible.”
answer,
“i
told
him
in
addition
to
the
proposition
which
is
not
in
here
that
he
should
not
and
must
not
volunteer
any
information
unless
the
question
was
asked
of
him,
in
which
event
certainly
he
had
to
tell
the
truth.”
i
think
he's
saying
practically
the
same
thing
himself
right
there.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
whether
what,
sir?
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
on
page
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
no.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
assume.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
do
you
want
to
know
if
there
were
answers
--
were
untruthful?
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
sir,
i
think
they
were
untrue
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
i
refer
to
page
4
of
the
printed
record
wherein
i'm
examining
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
well,
i
think
i
can.
i
would
like,
however,
to
read
the
true
testimony
of
the
witness,
castilleja,
which
was
acknowledged
later
on
by
mr.
barrera.
as
--as
i
started
to
say,
i'm
examining
him
on
page
4
in
the
hearing
on
the
writ.
“alright,
tell
me
whether
or
not
you
ever
had
sexual
intercourse
with
herlinda
alcorta?”
answer,
“i
did.”
“when
was
the
first
time,
son?”
“i
can't
remember
exactly
the
time.”
“well
approximate
how
long
after
the
first
time
you
gave
her
a
ride
home?”
answer,
“the
third
time
i
would
say.”
“about
the
third
time
and
where
did
that
take
place?”
then
he
goes
on,
and
tells
about
where
the
first
act
took
place.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
didn't
get
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
sir,
but
bear
in
mind
that
the
district
attorney
had
been
given
this
same
information
before
the
trial.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes
and
had
that
and
after
that
while
he
was
taking
his
--
the
affidavit
from
the
witness,
he
was
given
this
information
and
he
admits
that
it's
in
the
record
by
mr.
barrera
that
we
have
that
information.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
don't
quite
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
that's
right.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
that's
right.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
now,
we
admit
that
the
direct
question,
“did
you
ever
have
intercourse
with
herlinda
alcorta,”
was
not
asked
by
mr.
barrera.
but
to
say
that
it
wasn't
asked
even
stronger
and
more
emphatically
by
these
series
of
questions,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
--
anything
else
can
be
said.
in
the
hearing
on
the
writ,
mr.
barrera,
in
response
to
questions
to
one
of
his
co-counsel,
mr.
woods,
made
these
statements.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
page
77
of
the
printed
record.
question,
“mr.
barrera,
going
back
to
the
taking
of
statement
on
july
20th,
is
i
believe
of
1955.”
“yes
sir.”
“you
were
present,
and
mr.
torres
was
present
and
then
natividad
castilleja
was
present.”
“that's
correct.”
“just
what
did
you
tell
natividad
at
that
time
and
place?”
the
situation
as
i
recall
it
was
this,
mr.
--
was
this.
“mr.
torres
had
been
talking
to
castilleja.
he
had
a
statement
in
writing
already
and
asked
me
to
go
in
there
and
look
it
over
and
look
at
it
before
the
witness
signed
it.
at
that
time
i
went
in.
i
read
the
statement.
i
ask
castilleja
if
the
statement
contained
therein
was
true.”
he
said,
“yes.”
“i
had
a
conversation
with
mr.
torres
in
private.
i
asked
him
whether
or
not
he
--
that
--
that
he
asked
if
there
was
--
if
there
was
or
was
not
any
intercourse
between
natividad
and
--
and
the
deceased
in
this
case.”
he
said,
“he
wasn't
too
satisfied
about
that.”
we
both
then
went
back
in
and
continued
to
ask
him
questions
about
prior
acts
of
intercourse.
he
finally
admitted
that
he
had
had
intercourse
with
herlinda
alcorta
on
several
occasions.
i
asked
him
whether
or
not
he
had
had
intercourse
with
herlinda
on
the
night
in
question,
that
is,
the
night
of
the
killing
and
he
emphatically
denied
it.
he,
as
i
recall
was
reluctant
to
sign
a
statement,
with
any
statements
contained
therein
about
intercourse.
i
was
told
at
the
time
that
the
fact
alvaro
alcorta
whose
confession
i
had
taken
approximately
or
had
been
present
at
the
time
it
was
taken
approximately
a
week
or
possibly
two
weeks
before,
that
at
the
time
of
the
taking
of
that
confession
from
alvaro
alcorta,
he
gave
me
no
indication
that
he
knew
of
any
misconduct
on
the
part
of
his
wife.
that
being
the
situation
and
not
being
a
--
that
being
the
situation,
not
being
a
price
of
it
then
such
a
situation
could
not
have
entered
into
his
mind
at
the
time
he
committed
the
killing
in
this
case
could
not
have
contributed
to
it.
keeping
further
in
mind
the
obvious
education
or
possible
lack
of
education
on
the
part
of
natividad
castilleja
and
the
possibility
that
there's
--
that
is
always
present
in
any
case
that
a
witness
may
later
decide
he
will
not
get
on
the
stand
and
tell
you
what
he
knows
or
the
possibility
of
having
to
refresh
his
memory
from
the
various
statement
you've
taken
from
him
or
the
possibility
of
arising
of
having
to
impeach
him
with
the
statement
you
have
taken
that
those
things
certainly
would
be
immaterial
to
the
all
over
--
to
the
overall
situation
in
this
case
especially
at
--
at
that
time
there
being
no
sure
answer
to
that.
i
think
it's
in
here
--
let
me
--
give
me
just
a
minute.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
that's
on
page
78.
i
told
mr.
torres
to
go
ahead
and
wind
up
the
statement
and
leave
those
things
out.
i
told
him,
however,
to
put
the
information
in
the
overall
jacket
which
is
a
matter
of
public
record
and
--
and
contained
therein
at
--
at
this
time
--
contained
therein
at
this
time.
i
told
castilleja
at
the
time,
an
answer
to
his
question,
what
shall
i
do
or
say
if
someone
comes
out
to
see
me
because
i
asked
him
has
anyone
been
out
to
see
you.
he
said,
“nobody
has
been
out
to
contact
me.”
he
says,
“what
shall
i
do
if
someone
comes
out
to
see
me?”
i
said
if
someone
comes
out
to
see
you
and
wants
a
statement
from
you,
then
you
may
give
them
a
statement
if
you
want.
you
don't
have
to
give
a
statement
if
you
don't
want
to.
i
would
prefer
that
you
do
not.
now,
speaking
about
putting
this
information
in
the
jacket
and
this
being
a
matter
of
public
record,
in
this
record
mr.
barrera,
in
the
hearing
on
the
writ,
admitted
that
had
any
attorney,
alcorta's
attorney
or
anyone
else
before
the
trial
was
over,
came
in
and
asked
to
see
that
information
or
to
see
that
jacket
that
he
would
not
have
given
it
to
him.
i
asked
him
a
specific
question.
i
asked
him,
“would
you
after
the
trial
wasn't
over
but
in
due
time
to
raise
all
these
on
newly
discovered
evidence?
would
you
give
him
that
information?”
at
that
time
he
said,
“no,
not
until
the
appeal
is
over
and
everything
is
closed.
but
he,
in
several
instances
in
the
record,
he
refers
to
all
this
information
being
in
the
jacket
and
being
a
matter
of
public
record
and
that
all
or
any
attorney
had
to
do
was
to
get
custody,
has
his
name
off
the
indictment,
go
out
and
see
him
and
get
the
same
information.
however,
he
seems
to
overlook
the
fact
that
he
has
told
castilleja
on
several
other
occasions
not
to
--
not
to
see
anyone,
not
to
talk
to
anyone,
not
to
give
anyone
any
--
any
information
at
all.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
they
have
--
they
have.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
excuse
me.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
the
---
the
evidence
all
through
this
record
that
the
defendant
suspected.
he
never
saw
his
wife
in
actual
act
of
intercourse
with
any
other
man.
but
he
suspected
that's
sort
of
conduct
not
only
with
this
man
but
with
several
other
men
and
he
tells
about
having
seen
them
at
this
night
club
--
in
that
night
club.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
but
the
--
the
harm
was
this.
what
he
testified
as
to
what
his
state
of
mind
was
--
was
true
and
had
he
been
corroborated
by
castilleja,
who
might
have
said
in
effect
that
what
this
man
suspected
of
my
conduct
with
his
wife
was
true
and
that
we
were
hugging.
we
were
kissing.
we
had
done
it
before.
the
jury
would
have
believed
and
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
and
probably
would
have
felt
that
he
had
adequate
cause
to
become
enraged
and
angered
and
--
and
put
himself
in
a
situation
or
state
of
mind
were
he
was
not
capable
of
true
reflection.
but
when
castilleja
says,
“no,
that's
not
true.
she's
just
a
friend
of
my
sister's.
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
that.
i
was
just
giving
her
a
ride
home.”
the
jury
got
the
impression
or
felt
this
way.
that
he
not
only
killed
his
wife
but
now
he
is
up
here
lying
about
it
running
down
a
reputation.
and
the
--
they,
the
jury,
were
in
a
frame
of
mind
then
where
they
were
even
more
angry
at
him.
angry
because
of
the
killing
and
angry
because
of
what
he
was
doing
to
her
reputation.
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
real
damage
by
the
testimony
of
castilleja.
now,
jury
got
this
sort
of
picture.
that
from
the
testimony
of
castilleja,
that
--
that
alcorta
for
no
reason
at
all
and
without
just
provocation
or
without
any
mitigating
circumstance
or
reason,
stabbed
this
well-behaved
wife
and
mother
when
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
and
if
castilleja
had
told
the
truth
and
corroborate
it,
the
jury
would
have
seen
that
he
did
kill
his
wife
but
she
wasn't
an
innocent,
well-behaved
wife
and
mother.
she
was
running
around
just
like
alcorta
said
she
was.
she
was
in
this
man's
arms
just
before
he
stabbed
her
and
the
sight
of
her
in
his
arms
so
inflamed
him
that
he
couldn't
reflect
coolly
and
under
those
circumstances
he
stabbed
her
and
under
those
circumstances,
it's
a
murder
without
malice.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
but
contradicted
it
by
--
by
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
any
of
the
truth
regarding
his
relationship
with
her.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
i
think
had
he
told
the
truth
about
his
relationship
with
her
that
the
jury
would
certainly
have
--
have
believed
alcorta
when
alcorta
says
i
came
upon
them
kissing
in
each
others
arms
and
had
i
waited
a
few
minutes
and
had
a
camera,
i
could
show
the
jury
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
he
did.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
castilleja.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
that
--
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
castilleja
had
denied
that
he
was
kissing
her
at
the
time
the
husband
came
up,
but
to
the
contrary,
said
i
was
sitting
there
talking
to
her
about
church.
she
was
telling
me
to
tell
your
sister
to
call
me
so
that
we
can
go
to
church
together
in
the
morning.
i
don't
think
they
were
talking
about
going
to
church.
two
people,
by
--
who
by
the
admission
of
--
of
castilleja
had
been
out
together
many
times
and
had
intercourse
together
many
times
and
the
record
shows
him
at
the
house
on
other
occasions
as
--as
they
were
on
this
--
on
this
occasion
when
the
stabbing
took
place.
they
weren't
talking
about
church,
they
were
doing
exactly
what
alcorta
said
they
were
doing.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
mr.
barrera,
in
one
of
his
letters,
and
i
think
in
the
letter
to
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
or
in
the
testimony
he
gave
in
the
trial
said
that
castilleja
told
him
that
he
had
had
intercourse
with
her
after
he
brought
her
home
from
work
and
on
the
way
home
from
work.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
after
he
brought
her
home,
they
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
house
and
had
intercourse
in
the
car
just
like
they
were
about
to
do
on
this
occasion
when
the
defendant
walked
up
himself.
now,
that's
--
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
his
own
testimony,
of
castilleja.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
he
tells
about
having
danced
with
her
at
several
clubs.
did
you
know
where
he
had
been?
do
you
know
when
she
died
approximately
on
june
19th?
now,
this
is
page
2
of
the
printed
record.
when
was
the
first
--
question,
“alright,
when
did
you
first
meet
her?”
answer,
“well
the
first
time
i
saw
her
in
the
dance
but
the
first
time
i
really
got
to
talk
to
her
was
in
my
sister's
house.”
question,
“where
was
that
dance
were
you
first
saw
her?”
answer,
“the
los
angeles
night
club.”
question,
“los
angeles
night
club?”
answer,
“yes,
sir.”
“is
that
the
place
ran
by
so
and
so?”
“yes.”
then
he
goes
on
about
seeing
her
again
at
his
sister's
house
and
his
sister
says,
“i'll
appreciate
if
you
give
her
a
ride
home
from
time
to
time.”
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
of
the
printed
record?
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
yes.
mr.
fred
a.
semaan
exactly.
now,
that
certainly
doesn't
go
along
with
what
can
be
assumed
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
barrera
about
having
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
before
and
had
intercourse
with
her
in
front
of
the
house
before.
and
that
leads
me
to
believe
and
i
think
anyone
must
have
seen
them
from
that
if
he
was
doing
just
what
he
did
on
other
occasions.
he
pulled
up
and
put
the
lights
out
and
they
were
in
and
embracing.
this
happened
at
the
house
when
he
came
up
on
this
occasion.
with
the
court's
permission
we
will
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
we
have
for
rebuttal.
