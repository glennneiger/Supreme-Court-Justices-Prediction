mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
first
thing
i'd
like
to
do
would
be
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
here
a
moment
ago
and
to
clear
up
some
of
the
impressions
that
perhaps
were
left
as
to
the
record
as
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
questions
and
mr.
justice
clark's
questions.
the
question
that
was
asked
by
mr.
barrera
was
as
to
the
number
of
dates
that
the
witness
had
with
the
deceased
herlinda,
and
he
said,
“i
had
dates
on
the
occasions
that
i
brought
her
home,”
and
that's
correct,
that
is
truthful.
and
so
the
thing
that
i'd
like
to
make
at
the
very
outset
is
that
we
don't
feel
and
we
have
never
felt
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
convicted
the
witness
of
perjury
to
begin
with.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
have
subornation
of
perjury
in
order
to
knowingly
use
perjury
by
the
prosecutor,
there
must
be
showing
of
untruth.
and
when
he
answered
that,
he
answered
truthfully.
the
dates
that
i
had,
“i
had
no
dates
other
than
when
i
took
her
home,”
and
that's
exactly
what
he
said
and
that's
what
he
testified
too,
later.
even
as
to
these
--
as
he
said
three
or
four
--
or
four
or
five
or
five
or
six,
occasions
of
intercourse.
he
said
those
occurred
on
those
occasions
and
you'll
notice
here
in
the
record
when
mr.
semaan
was
questioning
the
man.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
sir?
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes.
that
the
occasion
in
which
he
took
her
home.
in
other
words,
his
answer
was,
“i
had
no
dates
other
than
the
occasion
when
i
took
her
home,”
you
see
and
we
just
don't
feel
that
that
answer
proves
perjury
upon
his
part
because
those
are
the
occasion
the
occasions
when
he
took
her
home.
in
other
words,
he
didn't
picked
her
up
and
--
and
go
to
x
night
club
or
he
didn't
pick
her
up
and
go
somewhere
else.
he
testified
of
the
occasions,
that
is,
for
instance
on
the
night
of
the
homicide
when
he
found
her
walking
by
the
street
and
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
home
and
on
another
occasions
when
he
brought
her
home
from
work.
you
see,
he
testified
to
those
occasion
when
he
took
her
home.
in
other
words,
he
had
no
date
in
the
sense
that
he
would
go
and
pick
her
up
at
her
home
and
take
her
out
somewhere
as
--as
anyone
might
understand
in
the
meaning
of
a
date,
in
that
sense.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
so,
it
was
on
the
occasions
that
he
took
her
home.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
sir?
no,
sir,
because
it
was
clearly
stated.
“i
had
no
dates
other
than
when
i
took
her
home.”
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
may
i
--
i
would
like
very
much
for
you
to
take
it
as
a
whole
and
that
was
my
very
next
point
and
that
is
to
say
that
when
you
are
looking
at
this
language
of
natividad
castilleja
you
must
look
at
his
entire
testimony
not
just
those
two
or
three
of
four
questions
that
wound
up
his
direct
examination.
look
at
his
entire
testimony
and
when
you
look
at
his
entire
testimony,
i
don't
think
you'll
find
or
i
don't
think
you'll
reach
that
conclusion.
i
don't
think
it
is
a
reasonable
conclusion
to
the
extent
that
the
man
has
perjured
himself
willfully
and
falsely,
told
an
untruth
under
oath
because
i
think
a
fair
examination
of
his
entire
testimony
illustrates
the
very
things
that
the
defendant
himself
testified
to.
the
defendant
said,
“well,
i
saw
him
dancing
at
this
place.”
he
said,
“yes,
i
was
there.
she
was
there
with
the
family.
i
danced
with
her.
other
man
danced
with
her.
i
danced
and
then
left
and
saw
here
later”
you
see.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
of
the
what,
sir?
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
of
the
relevance.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
well,
frankly
i
don't
know
except
as
the
prosecutor
has
indicated
that
as
is
the
last
question
or
two
there
to
indicate
this
particular
witness
had
no
bias
to
bear
against
the
defendant
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
as
to
what
he
said
and
i
think
the
record
demonstrates
clearly
that
he
did.
do
just
that.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
testified
that
he
told
the
truth
on
the
writ
hearing.
he
presents
that
in
a
number
of
instances.
“did
you
tell
the
truth?”
“yes,
i
did.”
“well,
why
didn't
you
go
into
these
sexual
relations?”
“it's
quite
simple.
i
wasn't
asked
the
question,”
that's
his
answer
repeatedly
in
there.
well,
and
he
was
questioned
in
this
very
point
by
mr.
semaan.
well,
you
said
that
--
that
you
didn't
have
any
dates
with
her,
how
about
that
or
weren't
you
perjuring
yourself?
and
he
says,
“no,
i
didn't
have
any
dates
other
than
these
occasions
when
i
took
her
home.”
you
see,
and
gives
an
explanation
about
that.
certainly
in
his
own
mind,
he
knows
that
he's
telling
the
truth.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
sir?
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
you
mean
on
the
writ
hearing?
i
don't
understand
you,
sir.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
--
think
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
i
agree
with
you,
sir.
but
i
don't
believe
it
was
done
in
this
case
and
i
don't
believe
the
record
will
demonstrate
that
when
the
record
is
read
as
a
whole,
not
just
an
isolated
question.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
well
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
and
the
evidence,
may
i
submit
respectfully,
mr.
justice
black,
the
evidence
as
a
whole
does
not
show
that.
the
evidence
as
a
whole
does
not
show
that
relationship
that
it
was
innocent
and
they
didn't
desire,
that
is,
to
say
that
the
deceased
was
entirely
innocent
or
that
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
--
she
was
a
virtuous
woman,
you
see.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
--
when
you
take
it
all
as
a
whole.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
the
jury
in
sitting
on
this
case
and
listening
to
all
of
the
evidence
not
an
isolated
set
of
questions
one
or
two
or
three
questions
listening
to
all
of
the
evidence
about
the
background
between
the
defendant
and
his
wife
and
his
troubles
with
her,
uncontested
troubles
that
she
was
at
that
they
were
separated
for
10
months,
that's
true,
they
were
separated
for
10
months.
whether
she
was
taking
care
of
the
kids
or
not,
we
don't
know,
we
couldn't
contest
that,
but
the
things
that
he
testified
to,
that
they
were
dancing,
that
he
had
seen
her
with
other
men,
were
all
admitted.
they
were
true.
the
witness
castilleja
had
testified
to
that
and
all
the
other
witnesses
brought
that
out,
you
see.
there
wasn't
any
question
but
what
the
jury
had
the
impression
that
here
was
a
woman
who
was
separated
that
she's
been
going
with
men
from
time
to
time
and
here's
a
young
19-year-old
boy
that
she
was
going
home
with,
you
see.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
no
sir.
i
don't
see
that
the
jury
had
the
impression
that
there
was
sexual
relation.
i
say
that
the
jury
could
not
have
had
the
impression
that
she
was
entirely
virtuous
and
that
the
relation
between
a
19-year-old
unmarried
man
and
a
--
and
a
mother
of
two
or
three
children
here,
under
the
circumstances
and
separation,
all
of
that,
that
was
--
that
was
an
entirely
platonic
relation
or
that
the
deceased
–-
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
again,
yes
sir
--
again,
your
honor,
if
that
were
taken
alone,
however,
you
raised
the
question
about
the
car
stopping
and
the
carburetor.
the
defendant
himself
testified
that
the
car
started
up,
that
the
door
was
opened
just
as
she
was
getting
out
when
he
jumped
in
and
started
stabbing
her,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
he
tugged
over
the
car
and
drove
off,
the
door
was
still
open.
in
other
words,
his
wife
was
in
the
act
of
getting
out
of
the
car
by
his
own
testimony.
the
door
was
open
when
he
jumped
in.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
the
car
was
in
motion
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
is
the
conclusion
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
--
from
the
door
was
open
and
the
legs
were
out.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
let
me
correct
that
by
saying
that
i
think
that
is
fair
inference
to
draw
from
his
testimony
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
--
at
the
trial
and
on
the
confession,
yes
sir.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
and
that
is
to
say
that
because
the
court
below
has
made
specific
findings
of
fact,
that
this
court
under
the
authority
of
fay
versus
new
york,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
two
fay
cases
there
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
the
effect
that
this
court
has
no
authority
or
really
as
a
matter
of
exercising
its
judgment
and
discretion
will
not
disturb
findings
of
fact
on
disputed
issues.
and
yes
sir,
we
have
stated
those
in
our
brief
and
that
has
a
--
it's
a
separate
argument
that
we
have
stated.
in
other
words,
as
i
understood
your
questioning
earlier
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
no
sir,
we
don't
take
that
position.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
we
take
the
position
that
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
he
has
had
his
full
hearing.
he
has
had
his
full
opportunity
to
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
--
make
his
proof.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
he's
had
his
--
his
hearing
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
where
all
of
the
evidence
was
heard
and
argued
as
it
is
here
and
the
court
made
the
specific
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
--
findings.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
prove
up
your
case?
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
no,
because
the
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
because
he
was
at
no
time
denied
his
right
to
make
proof.
he
has
made
his
proof.
yes,
sir?
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
i
think
so,
so
far
as
--
as
the
holdings
and
the
findings
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
expressed
in
those
opinions
are
concerned,
yes
your
honor.
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
he
has
made
me
--
he
has
made
--
had
the
opportunity
to
make
his
full
proof.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
highest
code
of
--
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
sir,
i
can't
quite
hear
you.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
findings
that
i
am
referring
to
are
the
findings
found
on
206
and
207.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
the
sense
that
the
court
heard
all
of
the
evidence,
heard
the
arguments
and
found
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
support
his
allegations.
further,
the
specific
--
more
specific
findings
made
my
judge
morrison
as
to
what
actually
was
said
and
was
not
said
between
the
witness
and
the
prosecutor.
he
says
that
he
was
advised
to
tell
the
truth
at
all
times,
right
after
the
end
--
that's
right
at
the
bottom
of
page
207.
just
tell
the
truth
about
such
of
this
relationship
but
not
volunteering
the
information
unless
he
was
asked.
and
also,
the
finding
at
the
top
of
page
208
by
judge
morrison,
down
a
few
lines,
it
was
not
shown
that
any
of
the
answers
were
untrue.
in
other
words,
you
have
a
finding
here
of
the
texas
court
with
the
answers
given
by
the
witness,
castilleja,
were
not
untrue.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
are
three
judges.
there
are
two
opinions.
the
first
finding
that
i
mentioned
was
the
opinion
of
two
judges,
the
third
as
to
what
was
said
by
the
prosecutor
and
castilleja
and
that
the
answers
were
truthful,
that
was
the
finding
of
judge
morrison.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
yes
sir,
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
well,
he
wanted
to
elaborate
on
in
more
detail
as
to
what
their
findings
were.
their
finding
first,
generally
was
that
the
proof
did
not
support
his
allegations
and
so
he
went
ahead
and
elaborated
further.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
well,
i
make
this
position
that
the
--
they
heard
the
evidence,
not
a
mooney
versus
holohan
case,
where
it's
a
question
of
the
allegation.
the
allegations
are
sufficient.
it's
a
question
of
the
proof.
this
is
a
factual
matter.
that's
simply
where
it
boils
down
to.
this
court
passed
on
the
facts
and
found
that
the
facts
did
not
sustain
the
allegations.
judge
morrison
went
further
in
a
separate
concurring
opinion
to
set
those
matters
out.
mr.
hubert
w.
green,
jr.
it
is
a
finding
and
i
can
suggest
only
that
it
is
a
finding
of
one
of
the
judges
in
a
concurring
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
within
the
rule
of
the
fay
case
and
other
cases
where
findings
of
a
trial
court
or
an
appellate
court
are
entitled
to
great
weight
by
this
court.
i
don't
take
the
position
that
in
a
constitutional
matter
that
the
court
in
all
the
cases
is
going
to
ignore
what
the
findings
might
be
and
--
or
be
bound
by
it
in
advance,
certainly
not.b
ut
we
feel
in
this
case
here
that
the
evidence
being
what
it
is
so
much
of
it
is
hearsay,
hearsay
based
on
hearsay,
the
fact
that
mr.
barrera
was
supposed
to
have
been
quoted
in
some
out-of-court
hearing
in
the
board
in
the
matters
of
that
saw
these
as
certain
matters.
he
is
basing
his
contentions
upon
that.
he
is
basing
his
contentions
upon
affidavits
from
the
witness
castilleja,
one
of
the
affidavits
that
he
quoted
from
here
exhibit
c
was
a
matter
of
the
very,
very
first
affidavit
that
he
quoted
from
but
he
did
not
mention
the
portion
in
the
affidavit
where
the
witness
is
supposed
to
have
said,
"i
admit
that
i
lied
at
the
trial.
i
was
asked
the
question
by
our
court
with
this
lawyer
as
to
whether
i
had
intercourse
and
i
denied
it
and
i
admit
purging
in
substance."
that's
what
he's
supposed
to
have
stated
in
one
of
the
affidavits.
then
upon
the
trial,
he
repudiates
those
affidavits
and
evidence
of
that
character
and
testifies
openly
in
court
and
states
unequivocally
we
have
recited
the
places
in
our
brief
where
he
says,
"i
told
the
truth."
he
makes
explanations
as
to
his
answers
here
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
about
dates
and
other
matters.
“i
told
the
truth
and
the
reason
i
did
not
go
into
the
matter
of
intercourse
was
that
i
was
not
asked
those
questions.”
now,
we
feel
that
this
case
does
not
come
within
the
ruling
of
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner,
and
that
is,
the
dyer
case
and
the
baldy
case
and
the
--
the
dyer,
the
baldy
and
the
reagan
cases.we
think
those
are
extreme
cases
where
francis
in
the
reagan
case,
a
man
was
prosecuted
for
rape.
the
state
had
evidence
at
that
time
from
the
doctor
who
had
examined
the
prosecutor,
there
was
no
rape.
the
prosecutor
to
--
was
a
virgin.
in
other
words,
the
very
prosecution
itself
was
a
fraud.
then
you
have
the
two
circuit
court
decision
cited
here,
dyer
and
baldy
concerning
the
matter
of
suppression.
we
feel
that
those
facts
are
far
and
above
extreme
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case.
in
one
case,
where
the
--
the
bullets
were
an
evidence.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
question
where
the
men
were
robbing
a
store
there
and
the
question
was
who
actually
shot
the
deceased,
was
it
the
defendant
or
even
policemen?
and
the
state
sought
to
prove
that
the
defendant
fired
the
fatal
shot
knowing
all
the
while
that
it
had
evidence,
it
had
a
bullet
and
it
had
an
expert
witness
by
hand
to
testify
that
no,
it
wasn't
the
defendant's
bullet,
it
was
a
policeman's
bullet
that
killed
the
defendant.
that
basic,
that
extreme,
in
other
words,
keeping
out
evidence
or
trying
to
prove
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
did
fire
the
fatal
shot
knowing
all
along
that
he
had
not
fired
the
fatal
shot
and
the
dyer
case
is
equally
extreme
in
a
situation
where
the
state
there,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
sought
to
prove
that
--
and
did
prove
by
certain
witnesses
that
the
defendant
was
sober
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
knowing
at
the
very
same
time,
a
witness
who
did
not
testify
and
was
kept
away
from
the
trial
and
was
excused
on
the
night
of
that
night
session
was
going
to
testify
that
he
was
drunk.
now,
you
have
compounded
in
those
cases
a
situation
where
in
the
baldy,
where
counsel
for
the
defendant
asking
whether
you
have
other
bullets,
you
couldn't
have
it
in
certain
bullets
but
do
you
have
other
bullets
and
no
reply
was
made.
you
have
in
the
dyer
case,
compounding
this
fraud
is
overt
fraud
to
the
court
and
to
the
jury,
you
had
counsel
rising
up
and
standing
and
saying
there's
no
use
calling
this
second
state's
witness,
the
second
policeman.
he'll
only
corroborate
the
first
policeman
when
he
knew
that
was
false
telling
them.
also
you
have
the
situation
there
where
in
pennsylvania,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
the
prosecutor
had
called
all
of
his
witnesses
and
he
sat
there
and
listened
to
the
court
instruct
the
jury
in
that
fashion
knowing
that
he
had
not
called
that
witness.
now,
i
want
to
get
to
a
matter
that
i
think
is
basic
and
that
is
the
matter
brought
up
and
suggested
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner,
that
is
the
matter
cited
in
the
baldy
case.
one
of
the
reasons
probably
holding
in
the
baldy
case
was
that
this
evidence
was
so
well-concealed
that
you
could
not
fairly
accuse
defendant's
counsel
of
lack
of
due
diligence
and
that's
a
matter
that
they
have
skirted
around
that
they
have
avoided
at
all
times
in
this
case
and
in
this
litigation.
the
matter
of
the
diligence
and
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
he
has
not
exercised
the
diligence
and
all
of
the
matters
available
to
him
to
discover
these
very
matters.
