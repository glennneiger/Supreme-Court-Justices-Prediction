where
you
said
that
i
told
mr.
torres
to
go
ahead
and
wind
up
the
statement
and
leave
those
things
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
you
the
one
who
asked
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
the
one
who
asked
the
question?
justice

l.
black
did
you
ask
those
questions
that
were
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
know
at
that
time
that
he
had
told
you
that
he
had
had
sexual
intercourse
with
this
woman?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
where
--
where
was
she
at
the
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
barrera
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
accorded
the
relevance
of
the
question.
you
asked
justice
frankfurter
in
hearing
on
this
appeal
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
are
you
asked
during
the
trial
what
(inaudible)
have
you
ever
had
--
you
ever
felt
that
way?
and
have
you
ever
had
any
dangers
of
it
just
when
you
brought
out
--
just
when
you
brought
out
between
what
--
what
was
the
relevance
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
to
fix
the
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
other
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would
seem
that
that
--
it
would
seem
to
one
degree
that
what
she
was
trying
to
do
was
to
show
that
there
has
been
no
intimate
relation
here
and
that
was
plain
purpose
of
what
you
had
to
testify
before
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
date
and
love
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
date
and
love
now
in
texas
as
i've
to
assume
and
probably
that
if
a
defendant
decides
to
murder
as
a
man
who
kills
--
killing
a
man
were
describe
in
a
car
in
a
moment
that
if
it
appears
before
the
jury
that
the
man
had
been
going
out
with
her
and
having
intercourse
with
her
it
would
likely
have
a
pretty
heavy
influence
on
the
jury,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
admissible,
if
it's
admissible
they
had
to
offer
evidence
to
show
that
the
man
might
have
acted
under
the
heat
of
passion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
stated
on
the
stand
that
he
did
have
knowledge
and
he
suspect
--
been
waiting
for
here
and
there
he
found
them,
could
that
have
been
the
testimony
to
show
that
you
might
appeal
as
the
heat
of
passion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
what
the
man
saying
is,
he
never
seen
anything
wrong
with
his
wife
dancing,
drawing
an
inference
from
that,
that
he
wouldn't
get
mad
if
he
saw
--
when
he
said
he
saw
it
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
a
man
who
had
done,
what
the
man
have
already
have
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
feels
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
had
an
intercourse
with
her
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
you
asked
him
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
knew
that
if
that
came
out
it
occurred
in
the
haste
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
statements
have
you
made
mr.
barrera?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said,
what
statement
have
you
made
about
being
irrelevant
in
the
next
conviction
as
you
reverted,
if
the
state
approved
the
reason
the
man
who
killed
the
woman,
the
man
had
been
held
in
accordance
why
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
man
did
it
because
--
because
the
theory
was
most
of
the
men
would
sleep
with
his
wife?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
--
i
had
an
idea,
that
was
what
you
should
have
defended
properly
than
texas
have
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
practicality,
you
knew
that
and
to
that
extent
to
know
(inaudible)
that
have
you
had
these
questions
about
the
contrary
that
if
it
--
the
jury
there
knew
if
this
(inaudible)
his
wife
had
killed
him,
you
to
have
practically
no
chance
in
the
world
for
conviction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
practicality.
did
you
not
know
then
and
do
you
not
know
now
the
evidence
that
come
out
as
you
knew
you
had
the
(inaudible)
association.
the
evidence
that
come
out
if
this
man
had
been
(inaudible)
you
just
wouldn't
have
had
any
chance
to
convict
him
of
murder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is,
isn't
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
in
that
event,
you
knew
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
inference
attached
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
a
--
that
was
a
joint
undertaking
of
the
testimony.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
a
joint
undertaking
was
an
--
an
undertaking
on
the
part
of
the
witness
and
undertaking
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor's
attorney.
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
i
mean
that
when
these
questions
were
asked,
there
was
a
joint
enterprise.
the
witness
wants
to
testify
to
prosecuting
attorney
who
was
asking
the
questions,
objective
of
that
which
bring
truth
to
the
jury
and
not
deception.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
your
judgment
it
is
fair
in
the
prosecution
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
ask
questions
believing
the
impression,
knowing
it
fully
that
has
no
by
--
nothing
between
them
that
at
the
time
(inaudible)
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
knows
that
that
is
false.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
prosecuting
attorneys,
of
course,
do
not
always
simply
go
by
the
letter
of
the
point
in
a
word.
here
there
was
an
issue
that
he
thought
your
prosecuting
--
your
assistant
rolled
in
and
try
to
show
a
kind
of
a
nice
relationship
between
these
points.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
he
knew
that
if
there
wasn't
that
kind
of
relationship
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have,
of
course,
the
beyond
--
you
the
beyond.
we
have
a
number
of
cases
like
the
(inaudible)
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
cannot
take
unfair
(inaudible)
with
knowledge
on
his
part
that
they
are
wrong
impressions
left
upon
which
man
is
lying
before
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here
it
is
possible
to
that
knowledge
that
these
questions
were
asked
to
leave
an
impression
in
the
jury
that
there
was
an
innocent
relationship
between
these
people
when
the
prosecuting
attorney
knew
that
there
was
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
the
jury
have
this
idea
there
was
sexual
relationship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
continue
if
they
had
lead
the
answer
to
the
question
that
he
had
approve
with.
it
only
takes
a
home
to
obtain
the
work
and
in
those
occasions
taking
directly
home
than
on
this
particular
occasion,
the
carburetor
gave
them
trouble
and
they
need
to
stop
on
the
purpose
of
a
mere
discussion
of
going
to
church,
couldn't
the
jury
very
well
had
known
under
those
circumstances
nothing
wrong
about
it
and
that
it
was
of
a
worse
crime
than
ever
for
the
husband.
