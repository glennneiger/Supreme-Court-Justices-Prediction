mr.
barrera,
if
i
remember
when
the
--
had
he
had
intercourse
with
her
when
he
was
supposed
to
take
her
home
today
from
her
work?
justice
tom
c.
clark
isn't
it
true
that
he
testified
that
--
that
occurred
in
a
vacant
lot
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
near
his
house.
justice
tom
c.
clark
near
his
house.
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
in
her
house.
justice
tom
c.
clark
will
you
construe
that
to
mean
that
they
were
on
their
way
from
work.
justice
tom
c.
clark
don't
you
think
that
left
with
a
rather
--
that
justice
brennan
indicated
and
explained
that
connotation
is
no
less
than
to
leave
the
impression
with
the
jury
that
he
was
just
--
was
carrying
them
back
and
forth
from
work?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
that's
true
but
if
you
were
to
prosecute
her
or
would
--
for
fairness,
did
you
not,
alcorta?
you
aren't
supposed
to
persecute
him,
you
were
supposed
to
be
fair
with
him.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
do
you
think
it
was
fair
for
you
to
leave
an
impression
with
the
jury
that
this
man
whom
you
knew
had
had
a
series
of
absolute
(inaudible)
and
not
taking
her
just
home
from
work
but
had
taken
her
via
a
vacant
lot,
at
his
house
before
he
took
her
home
is
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
i
can
understand
that.
i'm
talking
about
your
action
in
asking
these
questions.
i
can
see
why
you
wouldn't
give
a
statement
that
he
had
made
from
the
other
side
possibly
although
most
(inaudible)
but
where
you
take
a
statement
and
you
know
and
you
provide
the
statement
is
(inaudible)
as
you
did
here
and
put
one
in
the
file
and
another
in
the
summary
section
of
the
file.
and
you
knew
one
of
these
acts
and
still
you
asked
him
a
question
at
least
the
impression
with
the
jury
his
answer
there
that
all
he
did
was
to
run
from
work
to
whom
each
time
when
you
know
that's
not
true
yourself.
