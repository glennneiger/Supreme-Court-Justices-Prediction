mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
book
majors
expenses.
it
involves
the
question
of
payments
made
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
inducing
the
commission
of
a
crime.
the
amounts
involved
are
for
three
years,
48,
49
and
50,
about
19,000
wages
paid
to
men
who
record
the
bets,
and
8700
approximately
of
rent
for
the
first
year
and
a
total
of
about
32,000,
below
32,000
for
each
of
the
subsequent
years.
the
payments
are
in
violation
of
the
statute
of
illinois.
the
bookmaking
establishment
was
operated
in
the
central
business
district
of
chicago
in
a
hotel.
it
moved
around
a
number
of
times
because
the
police
caught
up
with
it
or
interfered
with
its
activities.
and
the
hotel
owner
furnished
a
new
location
in
the
same
hotel
and
there's
a
direct
finding
that
the
hotel
owner
knew
that
these
premises
was
being
used
for
the
particular
purpose.
there's
a
direct
finding
by
the
court
that
it
was
in
violation
of
statutes
336
and
582
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
could
recover?
i
--
i
question
in
this
particular
situation.
there
are
some
illinois
cases
referred
to
in
the
petition
--
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
which
they
--
the
court
dealt
with
the
question.
but
there,
it
was
a
question
of
suit
between
the
parties
which
is
a
different
problem
under
illinois
law,
one
thing.
and
secondly,
it
was
a
question
of
whether
he
leased
the
particular
premises
rather
than,
whether
he
permitted
the
use
of
the
premises.
now,
i
--
i
haven't
found
any
illinois
case
to
the
effect
that
if
he
permitted
the
use
of
the
premises,
he
could
recover.
and
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondents
distinguishes
particularly
between
that
language
of
leasing
or
permitting
the
leasing
or
rent
and
permitting
the
use,
which
is
the
word
of
the
statute
called
attention
to
the
difference.
the
particular
statute
involved
is
set
forth
on
the
--
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
3.
and
the
language
that
we
think
was
violated
and
that
the
court
agreed
and
found
particularly,
runs
down
to
the
seventh,
the
eighth
line
or
any
person
who
records
or
registers
bets
or
wagers
or
sells
pools.
now,
the
acts
that
these
men
were
paid
for
were
specifically
found
to
be
the
registering
of
bets
or
wagers.
then,
you
follow
down
the
same
statute
about
six
lines
where
it
reads
or
being
the
owner,
lessee
or
occupant
of
any
room
shared
tenement,
tent
booth
or
building
or
part
thereof,
knowingly
permits
the
same
to
be
used
or
occupied
for
any
of
these
purposes.
then,
on
the
following
pages,
section
582,
which
is
the
regular
accessory
statute
and
provides
the
liability
in
that
event.
now,
there
is
no
question
of
what
this
was
--
it
satisfied
the
requirements
and
accessory
too,
but
there
are
the
particular
violations
of
the
law
of
illinois
that's
involved
here,
excuse
me,
and
the
payment
was
made
for
the
deliberate
and
expressed
purpose
of
having
these
crimes
committed.
so,
we
comment
within
this
general
doctrine
referred
to
by
the
court
in
lilly,
where
the
expenditures
are
made
themselves
in
violation
of
the
law.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
case
and
held
that
the
expenses
were
deductible
on
the
ground
of
their
doyle
decision,
an
earlier
case
similar
--
very
large
with
similar
facts,
on
the
theory
that
where
the
particular
expenses
were
an
integral
part
of
the
business
operation,
they
were
deducted,
but
if
they
were
concomitant
an
they're
referred
to
fines
and
penalties
as
concomitant,
an
example
of
concomitant,
then
they
would
not
be.
now,
when
you
get
down
to
it,
it's
an
almost
impossible
rule
to
try
to
apply
anything
of
that
character.
if
you
would
try
to
apply
it,
for
instance,
in
your
textile
mills
case
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
us
that
you
would
have
to
hold
that
the
regulation
in
that
case
which
prohibited
a
deduction
for
lobbying
could
not
be
valid
even
though
it
frustrated
a
clearly
defined
public
policy,
because
the
whole
purpose
of
that
activity
was
to
lobby
to
the
congress
a
return
of
these
assets.
and
they
had
to
hire
somebody
to
do
it
and
they
hired
their
only
logical
people
to
do
it,
the
publicist
and
two
lawyers,
but
this
court
said,
"the
regulation
was
valid.
the
expenses
were
not
deductible
because
they
would
frustrate
such
a
policy
and
it
was
proper
for
an
interpretation
of
this
provision
23
(a),"
which
the
court
said
was
ambiguous
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
considered
where
there
was
this
ordinary
and
necessary
where
it
would
be
a
frustration
of
a
clearly
defined
public
policy.
now,
concomitant
is
demonstrated
by
the
fines
and
penalties
that
the
court
referred
to.
if
you
would
take
integral
and
try
to
apply
it
in
this
situation,
then
you
get
down,
we
think,
to
the
proposition
that
the
more
illegal,
any
business
operation
is,
the
more
clearly
you're
going
to
give
him
a
deduction
for
whatever
expenses
he
does
and
--
and
specially,
if
those
expenses
are
violations
of
law
themselves.
now,
this
is
not
expenses
that
carry
on
this
business
activity,
in
order
to
forward
it
and
thereby
indirectly
contributed
to
an
illegal
activity.
these
expenditures
are
in
themselves
and
by
themselves,
whether
this
--
these
particular
respondents
had
any
connection
with
this
business
of
violation
of
law
and
that's
the
issue
involved
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
because
a
man
is
operating
an
illegal
business
or
is
operating
a
legal
business.
he
can
hire
somebody
to
violate
the
law
and
then
deduct
the
amount
that
he
spends
for
that
purpose,
either
in
the
case
of
the
recording
of
the
bets
or
the
rental,
as
a
part
of
his
business
expense.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
go
that
far.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
don't
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
maybe
i
can
illustrate
it
this
way.
assume
that
there
wasn't
any
statute
like
336,
insofar
as
it
covered
the
rental
or
use
of
the
premises
for
an
illegal
purpose
or
assumed
that
--
that
clause
is
out
of
it
and
assume
the
other
part
about
recording
bets
or
wages
is
out
of
it
and
you
have
all
of
the
rest
of
it.
now,
the
respondents
would
be
violating
the
law
by
carrying
on
the
business,
but
this
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
could
hire.
he
would
be
hiring
people
to
record
his
bets.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
isn't
our
position.
and
we
don't
think
that
in
this
case,
the
court
has
to
reach
that
question
at
all.
because
if
you
did
not
have
this
particular
clause
as
to
recording
bets
or
as
to
the
use
--
permitting
the
use
of
premises
in
the
statute,
then
you
would
have
the
person
you
hired
to
help
you
commit
the
particular
illegal
act,
which
is
an
entirely
different
situation
from
hiring
a
person
to
violate
the
law
himself
independently.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
not
sure
that
it
did.
i
assume
that
it
didn't
involve
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
it
didn't
involve
the
chair
people
and
other
people
that
might
work
in
the
place.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
the
court
did
find
that
these
particular
people
were
participating
in
this
very
act
-
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
recording
the
bets.
and
i
was
trying
to
draw
the
difference,
the
distinction
and
i'm
saying
that
we
don't
yet
reach
the
case
of
the
question
about
the
people
who
would
not
be
in
themselves
committing
a
violation
of
the
statute
who,if
there
wasn't
such
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
at
this
part
of
their
activity
is
the
government's
position
was
recording
bets,
which
brings
them
to
--
in
direct
violation
of
this
statute
which
prohibits
such
an
act.
and
although
they
might
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
part
of
that
activity
was
a
direct
violation
of
the
statute
and
they're
hired
for
that
purpose.
now,
there
would
be
no
question
of
what
there
might
be
in
such
an
operation,
other
expenses
that
would
be
involved
to
include
stationary
and
chair
people
and
other
help
of
various
kinds
and
that
question
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
and
if
you
reach
the
point
so
far
as
the
question
of
a
gross
tax
as
distinguished
from
an
income
tax,
i
agree
to
justice
that's
a
--
there's
a
different
problem,
but
i
do
not
think
i
can
reach
it
in
this
case
at
all
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
case
where
there
is
a
violation
itself
by
the
particular
employees
at
the
time
when
they're
hired
for
the
purpose
of
violating
and
the
case
where
they
would
be
nearly
helping
him
to
violate
the
law,
which
would
not
be
an
independent
violation
by
them
in
so
doing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
might
be
a
possibility,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
the
mere
fact
that
you
recognize
that
he
can
engage
in
an
illegal
activity
of
wager
and
conduct
it
which
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
part
of
our
position
and
--
and
that's
part
of
the
expenses
that
were
disallowed.
now,
if
he
would
use
his
own
premises,
i
think
that
he
would
be
violating
the
law
himself
just
by
using.
in
the
same
way,
he's
violating
the
law
by
making
a
book.
there
isn't
any
question
what
he
violates
the
law
by
making
book
in
illinois.
he'd
also
be
violating
it
by
using
the
premises.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
haven't
got
that
question
in
this
case
either.
i
--
i'd
rather
wait
until
we
reach
that
problem.
but
here
is
a
case
where
he
goes
out
and
hires
people
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
violating
the
law
and
he
hires
someone
to
rent
premises.
now,
he
doesn't
have
to
do
that
and
that's
part
of
the
argument.
well,
you
let
this
man
engaged
in
illegal
activity.
i
don't
think
the
government
does
let
him
engage
in
it,
but
we
do
tax
him
for
engaging
in
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
go
that
far.
so,
there
is
an
assumption
that
he
is
engaging
in
an
activity
although,
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
passing
on
constitutionality
of
it,
that
there
was
an
element
of
deterrent
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
reach.
but
even
apart
from
that,
there
is
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
in
that
recognition,
any
recognition
of
the
principal
that
he
has
to
got
out
and
hire
other
people
to
violate
the
law
and
that
the
federal
government
is
approving
any
such
in
extension
of
his
activities.
now,
it's
very
interesting
if
you'll
look
at
the
economics
of
this
picture
too
and
it's
set
out
in
the
record.
this
operation
was
close
to
a
million
dollars
a
year
for
three
years
in
the
gross
wagers
that
were
taken
in.
and
the
gross
return
on
those
wagers,
on
this
business
was
about
six
and
a
half
--
six
and
eight
tenths
percent
the
first
year
and
it
worked
down
to
five
and
a
half,
a
little
over
five
and
half.
the
last
was
a
three-year
and
six
something
second
of
the
three
years.
now,
that
is
the
return
on
the
amount
of
money
that
was
bet.
that
isn't
the
return
like
in
the
ordinary
business
on
the
amount
of
money
you
got
invested
in
it
yourself.
so
that
if
you
follow
a
theory
that
it's
all
right
and
approved
by
the
federal
government
just
because
you're
taxed
under
the
wagering
tax
law,
a
man
for
conducting
a
wagering
business
that
you
approved,
the
development
of
that
business
as
much
as
he
can
develop
by
violating
any
laws
of
any
state
or
the
federal
government
as
a
part
of
it,
then
you
can
see
how
rapidly
he
increases
his
property
in
accordance
with
the
figures
right
here
in
this
case
where
he
makes
such
a
return
proportionately
on
every
dollar
that
he
gets
in
of
wagers.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
is
in
illinois.
now,
the
legislative
history
in
regard
to
this
matter
is
we
think
equivocally.
in
the
first
place,
when
the
1913
law
was
passed,
the
problem
of
it
being
discussed
by
senator
sterling
was
not
this
question
of
23
(a)
at
all.
the
general
policy
of
the
income
tax
law
was
being
discussed.
that
was
for
revenue
purposes
and
that's
been
recognized
by
this
court
many
times,
but
he
was
discussing
in
relation
to
that,
the
question
of
deducting
loses
from
gains
and
that
was
the
particular
discussion
there.
we
think
it
sheds
no
light
on
this
particular
problem.
now,
the
1951
legislative
history
does,
we
think,
have
some
bearing
upon
it.
we
think
it's
equivocal
and
it's
not
very
helpful,
but
we
think
it
--
we
need
to
deal
with
it.
because
at
that
time,
senator
(inaudible)
proposal
was
brought
before
the
congress
and
that
was
a
package
deal.
it
didn't
involve
just
this
question
of
disallowing
any
deductions
for
any
illegal
business.
but
it
also
included
the
question
of
registering
anybody
that
would
have
got
more
than
$10,000
a
year
from
one
or
more
illegal
businesses,
the
maintenance
in
keeping
of
records
and
books
and
that
those
records
and
books
have
to
kept
over
a
period
of
seven
years
and
that
there
should
be
provision
for
inspection
of
it.
now,
when
this
came
before
the
senate,
the
senate
committee
said
that
there
hasn't
been
sufficient
time
for
a
study
of
it
for
them
to
act
on
and
that
was
why
they
didn't
act
at
that
time.
and
we
think
that
the
whole
picture
was
so
confused
as
to
the
number
of
different
problems
that
were
presented
to
the
congress
in
that
legislation,
so
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
--
the
way
it
reached
the
congress,
mr.
justice,
was
there
was
an
attempt
by
senator
(inaudible)
to
amend
one
of
the
internal
revenue
measures
that
was
before
the
congress
and
he
tried
to
insert
it
in
that
manner
which
was
not
the
ordinary
test
of
such
legislation
and
some
of
the
arguments
were
made
pro
and
con
at
that
time
and
it
was
discussed
about
the
number
of
employees
that
would
cause
and
try
to
carry
it
out
many
other
things
that
really
shed
no
light
as
to
whether
or
not
the
congress
had
any
intention
to
try
to
depart
from
these
holdings
or
the
position
of
the
treasury
take
in
regard
to
this
matter
of
frustrating,
a
clearly
defined
public
policy.
then
the
--
the
other
reason
that
we
think
would
contribute
in
some
degree
is
the
proposal
and
i
think
it
was
1954,
the
american
law
institute
to
disallow
any
deductions
of
--
that
were
in
connection
with
an
illegal
business.
and
the
congress
did
not
take
any
action
at
that
time.
the
government
thinks
that
the
reason
--
that
the
action
was
not
taken
was
that
it
was
so
clearly
shown
by
all
of
the
court
decisions
up
to
that
time,
the
trend
and
the
attitude
of
the
courts,
the
tax
court
and
the
other
courts,
that
they
would
not
interpret
ordinary
and
necessary
as
including
deductions
for
such
activities
as
were
frustrating
and
clearly
defined
public
policy
that
the
congress
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
change
this
section
of
the
statute
which
had
been
so
interpreted
for
great
many
years.
and
there
is
the
tax
court
decision.
the
board
of
tax
appeals
cleared
that
to
the
early
days
of
the
board
in
regard
to
this
matter
in
which
they
had
denied
such
deductions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
some
ways,
i
think
it's
stronger
in
this
case
because
this
is
an
independent
violation
of
law
in
both
of
the
amounts
of
the
deduction.
and
then,
i
think
if
you
--
you
assume
that
this
man
couldn't
carry
on
his
business
without
hiring
somebody
else's
premises
or
without
hiring
someone
else
to
record
the
bets.
but
then,
you
get
into
the
problem
of
a
gross
tax,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
you
do
not.
but
i
don't
--
on
behalf
of
the
government,
i
don't
concede
that
the
fact
that
you
recognize
that
a
man
can
carry
on
a
wagering
business
includes
within
it
the
right
to
go
out
and
hire
people
to
break
the
law,
which
is
an
independent
violation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
get
back
to
the
proposition.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
whole
question
of
deductions
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
a
matter
of
grace
and
even
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
if
you
--
in
order
to
concede
that,
you'd
have
to
assume
that
he
had
to
run
his
business
that
way.
he
had
to
hire
other
people
to
violate
the
law.
that
would
be
the
only
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
true
but
there's
often
times
that
in
violations
of
laws
like
bribing
and
lobbying
and
all
of
those
things
that
it's
just
attractive
to
violate
the
law
because
it
--
it
helps
the
business.
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
question,
but
what
was
good
for
the
business
to
violate
the
law,
he
could
make
more
money.
but
still,
you
don't
recognize
the
right
to
deduct
that
as
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
this
particular
segment
of
that
business
had
no
one
--
no
other
purpose,
except
to
lobby
through
under
contract
this
particular
legislation
to
the
commerce.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
textile
mills.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
a
corporation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
this
particular
segment
of
their
business
was
a
special
contract
that
they
undertook
--
by
which
they
undertook.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
that
portion,
their
activity,
mr.
justice,
was
for
the
illegal
purpose
and
if
they
had
been
organized
only
for
that
purpose,
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
case
and
we
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
we
think
that
it's
comparable
to
the
fact
that
they
have
this
contract
for
that
special
purpose,
to
try
to
accomplish
this
by
illegal
means.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
i
have
about
a
minute
left.
i'd
like
to
be
sure
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that
the
government
does
not
think
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
levy
a
gross
income
tax.
now,
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
the
levying
of
a
gross
income
tax.
now,
we
do
have
problems
in
regard
to
classification
of
due
process,
if
the
classification
is
not
a
reasonable
classification.
but
it's
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
case
that
whether
a
person
is
in
a
legal
or
in
illegal
activity
that
he
could
not
deduct
for
the
expenses
that
he
incurred
in
inducing
someone
else
to
commit
a
crime.
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
wagering
tax
is
a
tax,
only
the
better
for
wager
at
all.
it's
a
tax
on
the
man
who
gives
the
--
the
money
to
the
bookmaker
and
the
bookmaker
is
merely
a
collector
of
that
tax,
but
it
is
a
gross
tax.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
think
that
it
does.
we
think
that
the
attitude
of
congress
is
evidenced
over
the
years
by
the
fact
that
this
position
has
been
taken
constantly
by
the
courts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
those
are
described
in
the
lilly
case
under
the
terminology
that
they're
incidental
to
the
illegal
acts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
but
they're
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
purchasing
a
pad
as
such
is
illegal,
but
it
does
say
recording
a
better
wager
is
illegal.
so,
the
act
of
these
men
were
being
paid
for
is
independently
illegal.
it's
just
like
you
would
ask
someone
to
go
out
and
commit
a
crime
for
you
and
you
pay
him
$100.
that
is
exactly
what
it
is.
now,
if
you
go
out
and
ask
him
to
buy
you
a
pad
and
you
want
to
commit
some
kind
of
a
crime,
that's
what's
involved
in
the
other
and
it's
more
remote.
this
court
dealt
in
the
heininger
case
with
the
fact
that
where
it's
more
remote
and
different
problem
and
the
one
--
the
government
isn't
saying
that
all
of
that
type
of
expenses
could
in
all
cases
be
recognized,
but
they
aren't
involved
in
this
case.
this
is
case
where
it's
a
direct
violation
of
the
state
law,
a
very
act
that
he's
paid
for.
and
there
was
no
showing
that
these
acts
were
not
for
this
very
purpose
of
recording
the
bets.
under
our
theory,
if
you
could
separate
them
out
and
show
that
a
portion
of
his
time
was
devoted
to
some
other
purpose,
then
we
would
--
i
would
assume
at
least
that
that
part
could
be
separately
deducted.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
showing
and
it
was
--
that
he
was
engaged
in
this
unlawful
activity
and
the
court
specifically
found
that
this
were
acts
that
were
in
violation
of
these
state
statutes.
