justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
the
six
or
seven
employees
--
these
figures
at
page
3
is
it
of
your
brief
or
six
rather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
represent
the
total
payroll
of
this
operation
for
the
years
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
didn't
--
it
does
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
--
is
--
is
that
to
suggest
then
that
to
the
extent
--
this
is
not
the
complete
payroll
where
deductions
allowed
for
other
wages
paid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
recording
of
bets?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
others.
your
breach
says
that
the
services
of
the
employees
were
performed
in
the
illegal
operation
of
the
partnership
including
the
recording
of
bets.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean
that
there
isn't
any
question
of
the
finding
are,
that
all
six
or
seven
and
if
that's
all
that's
involved
in
these
wages
were
in
fact
found
to
have
been
in
recording
the
bets?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
to
say
then
as
a
disallowance
of
their
wages
even
perhaps
though
--
but
five
minutes
of
an
eight-hour
day
would
spend
in
recording
bets?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rent
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
did
they
in
part
consist
of
wages
at
22%?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
are
the
wire
services,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
did
you
say
the
others
--
where
the
wire
services
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
what
--
i
know
what
it
is
--
what
else
besides
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
what
is
the
difference
in
the
expenses
for
wire
services
and
such
which
justifies
their
allowance
and
the
disallowance
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
these
--
these
were
the
scratch
pads
upon
which
i
gather
the
bets
are
recorded.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
only
the
fellow
who
records
them
is
disallowed,
but
the
expense
of
purchasing
the
pad
is
allowed.
