mr.
eugene
bernstein
justice
warren,
justices,
solicitor
general.
your
honor,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
this
case
has
involved
a
deduction
of
salaries
and
rents
paid
by
the
taxpayer
in
the
operation
of
the
bookmaking
in
the
state
of
illinois,
contrary
as
to
what
counsel
has
stated,
possibly
in
this
(inaudible)
the
total
salaries
and
the
total
rents
paid
were
disallowed.
well,
the
record
does
not
indicate
the
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
there
were
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
they
consisted
of
telephone,
wire
service,
spreadsheets.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
no,
we
have
no
electric
lights
in
our
case.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
oh
this
is
--
i'm
sorry.
in
one
case
we
--
in
the
--
in
one
of
the
cases,
we
had
electric
and
the
other
case,
we
didn't.
the
social
security
tax
is
on
the
salaries
and
wages
which
were
paid.
and
incidentally,
your
honors,
78%
of
the
total
of
the
expenses
comprise
the
rent
and
salaries.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
rent
--
rent
rather
and
--
and
the
compensation
paid
for
its
employees.
twenty-two
percent
of
those
expenses
were
allowed.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
no,
they
do
not.
there
were
no
wages
whatsoever
in
that
22%
either.
now,
the
petitioner
--
the
petitioner
admits
that
the
services
rendered
by
these
employees
were
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
this
business.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
that's
correct.
now,
we
concede.
we
believe
that
any
part
of
these
taxes,
any
part
of
expenses
are
disallowed
or
should
be
allowed.
we
are
not
trying
to
shift
positions.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
the
wire
service
which
is
only
--
it
could
be
certain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
it
will
be
spreadsheets
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
(inaudible)
used
for
the
book
making.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
(inaudible)
sheets.
i
believe
i
had
another
list.
the
list
here
is
formed
spreadsheets,
printed
and
stationary,
social
security
taxes,
supplies,
telephone,
repairs,
bad
checks,
pencils,
chalks,
miscellaneous,
depreciation
on
its
furniture
and
equipment
and
that's
about
what
it
was.
now
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
that's
our
position.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
correct,
your
honor
and
we
may
as
well
say
that
allows
only
22.5%
would
probably
(inaudible).
that
is
one
of
the
position
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
take
to
avoid
pitfall
of
gross
tax,
by
allowing
only
approximately
less
--
about
one-fifth
of
the
total
expenses
incurred
in
the
operation
of
this
business
and
he
is
trying
to
overcome
that
particular
pitfall
by
evading
himself
and
say,
“no,
this
is
not
a
gross
tax.”
now,
we
do
have
gross
tax,
and
again,
as
your
honor,
passed
on
the
wagering
law
and
that
is
not
only
a
gross
tax,
that's
based
on
the
total
wage
which
were
imposed
and
that
particular
tax
is
held
to
be
a
deductible
item
under
the
income
tax
law,
that
list
of
the
regulation
is
imposed.
now,
the
petitioner
for
the
first
time
asserts
a
rather
unique
problem
that
these
are
independently
illegal.
obviously,
he
is
trying
to
overcome
the
effect
of
his
acquiescence
in
the
(inaudible)
decision
which
is
in
tenth
tax
court
201.
that
case,
your
honor,
also
related
salaries
and
wages
deducted
by
a
bookmaker
and
it
involved
an
identical
statute
of
that
of
the
state
of
illinois
that
rose
at
the
state
of
texas.the
provisions
of
the
statute
were
alike.
they're
both
held
as
being
misdemeanor
and
still,
commissioner
acquiesced
in
that
decision.
and
the
result
of
that
--
that
acquiescence
was
to
serve
as
a
president
for
all
revenue
agents
to
act
and
their
allowance
of
salary
deductions
in
cases
of
a
similar
nature.
what
possibly,
your
honor,
is
maybe
what
it
means
of
the
commissioner
trying
to
overcome
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
made
before
the
american
bar
association
of
boston
in
1953,
where
it
stated
the
policy
of
its
department.
henceforth,
disallowed
the
reduction
of
all
illegal
expenses
incurred
and
illegal
enterprises
and
he
also
indicated
that
he
had
the
consent
of
the
treasury
department
to
aid
in
the
formation
of
that
policy.
now,
our
position
is
that
these
expenses
are
specifically
provided
in
section
23
(a)
(1)
(a)
by
the
ordinary
and
necessary
and
required.
now,
section
23
(a)
(1)
(a)
provides
specifically
that
all
expenses
incurred
or
paid
during
the
taxable
years
in
the
operation
of
any
business.
now,
it
doesn't
say
throughout
the
business
as
pointed
out
by
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
heininger
case.
it
places
no
words
of
limitation
and
as
specifically
this
additional
language,
including
reasonable
compensation
and
rents.
there's
a
specific
provision.
we
don't
have
in
this
case
the
similar
situation
where
congress
denied
specific
deductions
when
it
saw
fit
to
reenforce
the
sanctions
of
its
statutes
such
as
it
didn't
wait
the
stabilization
act
or
in
the
defense
production
act
or
the
--
the
defense
production
act
amendments
of
1950
and
1951.
so,
when
congress
intended
to
specifically
disallow
deduction,
it's
so
provided
by
statute.
we
also
had
an
income
tax
law
that
was
pointed
out
the
other
day,
but
the
income
tax
law
denied
this,
the
deduction
of
losses
from
gaining
in
excess
of
the
(inaudible).
it
cannot
be
set
off
against
other
income.
so,
we
have
again
a
specific
manifestation
of
what
the
intent
of
congress
is,
by
this
--
by
the
legislation
which
it
has
enacted
and
which
it
comes
before
this
court.
now,
the
judgment
said
in
the
heininger
case,
is
about
this
expense
to
what
have
been
no
business.
there
would
have
been
no
profit.
there
would
have
been
no
income
tax,
to
say
that
these
expenses
are
not
ordinary
and
necessary,
to
say
that
that
which
gives
a
light
being
that
ordinary
and
necessary.
and
(inaudible)
your
honor,
we
have
a
provision
of
the
income
tax
law,
that
said
you
should
keep
records
of
the
very
purpose
of
these
sheet
records,
the
very
purpose
of
the
--
these
individuals
recording
these
debts
is
to
keep
the
particular
record.
but
the
internal
revenue
officers,
we
shall
maintain,
that
we
shall
keep
and
those
are
the
specific
salaries
that
are
being
disallowed.
your
honor,
section
23
(a)
does
not
require
that
any
limitation
be
placed
upon
it
by
any
state
law
or
do
we
have
to
look
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
salary
compensation
and
rents
means
or
any
--
nor
can
the
state
place
limitation
on
that.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
no.
no
fines,
your
honor.
there
never
have
been
fines
here
imposed.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
as
to
the
fines
and
penalties,
your
honor,
i
have
a
different
position
and
i'm
--
i'm
following
the
position
of
this
court
on
that.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
yes,
on
--
on
fines
and
penalties.
i
don't
see
a
distinction.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
or
causes
of
fines
and
penalties,
we
have
a
different
problem
which
cannot
wait
in
no
time.
in
any
of
my
case,
i've
argued
the
doyle
ase
and
i've
argued
the
--
this
case
(inaudible)
and
i
don't
recall
any
type
of
any
fines
or
penalties
being
involved.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
well,
these
are
not
potential
fines,
your
honor.
it
is
this,
the
very
nature
of
this
expense
which
makes
it
possible
for
this
income
to
be
derive
from
(voice
overlap)
mr.
eugene
bernstein
your
honor,
the
income
tax
law
is
a
revenue
measure.
it
is
not
intended
to
please
or
to
supplement
the
penalties
imposed
by
the
states,
when
they
exert
such
a
penalty
for
violation
of
their
laws.
i
submit
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
all
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
yes.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
your
honor,
in
this
--
these
particular
cases,
the
tax
court
disallowed
the
deduction
on
the
theory
enunciated
by
counsel.
however,
te
search
of
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
they
held
that
they
are
not,
that
they're
--
they're
independently
illegal
enunciated
by
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
they
did
not
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
they
did
what
the
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
eugene
bernstein
your
honor,
it's
all
very
obvious,
that
one
operating
a
book
could
not
so
operate
unless
he
had
employees
to
accept
the
wagers
(inaudible)
tax
rests
upon
or
relies
upon.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
no.
i
did
not.
mr.
blair
tried
it
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
there
are
findings
of
the
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
well,
your
honor,
in
the
doyle
case,
there
was
a
specific
finding
involving
the
very
same
statute,
which
is
also
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
there
was
a
finding
of
fact
that
these
expenses
were
ordinary
and
necessary
which
the
case
has
perceived
this
case
and
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
seventh
circuit
has
followed
his
line
of
decisions
in
these
last
few
cases.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
mr.
justice
black
made
a
query
before
us
whether
a
finding
of
the
fact
was
made
in
the
cases
in
issue.
it
wasn't
a
direct
finding
of
fact
only
by
implication
that
the
words
necessary
and
ordinary
or
it
can
be
limited
by
a
legality
of
the
expenses
incurred.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
there
was
no
such
a
finding
of
facts.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
not
all
on
that
particular
issue.
your
honor,
the
--
the
doctrines
of
independently
illegal
has
been
applied
in
certain
types
of
cases.
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
lobbying
cases,
critical
favors,
bribery,
crimes
and
penalties.
it
will
be
your
honor
in
the
textile
case
is
strongly
relied
upon
by
counsel.we
still
don't
find
the
strong
language,
the
denial
as
indicated.
it
is
said
in
view
of
the
fact
that
congress
has
not
provided
for
this
deduction,
but
the
general
policy
came
into
play.and
by
inference,
one
would
assume
that
our
congress
provided
the
deduction
involving
the
expense.
the
general
policy
would
not
have
been
given
consideration.
now,
we
find
in
this
particular
section,
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
the
allowance
of
salaries
and
rents
incurred
in
this
trade
or
business.
now,
a
particular
proposal
suggested
by
senator
(inaudible)
who
was
rejected
by
the
senate
and
by
the
congress
rather,
were
caused
of
the
desire
or
its
realization
for
the
treasury
department
will
be
called
upon
to
interpret
the
laws
of
the
various
station
and
also
public
policy.
and
counsel
suggested
that
was
not
our
intent.
now,
it's
very
obvious
that
counsel
is
not
acquainted
with
illinois
law.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
language,
your
honor,
but
it's
obviously
--
it
states
on
his
brief
that
the
respondent,
its
employees
and
lessors
will
be
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
conspiracy
section
of
the
criminal
code
of
the
state
of
illinois.
our
supreme
court
in
dorman
versus
rather
people
versus
dorman
in
415
illinois
cited
in
our
brief
has
held
that
the
conspiracy
section
was
not
applicable
to
gain
the
act.
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
that
is
not
now
per
se
that
(inaudible)
prohibited
and
that
the
penalty
in
the
--
the
conspiracy
section
was
far
in
excess
of
that,
provided
under
the
wagering
act.
and
we're
also
rather
doubtful
as
to
what
position
the
illinois
courts
would
take
as
to
the
liability
of
a
landlord
for
violation
of
any
statute
that
we
just
set
forth
in
our
brief.
now,
the
inconsistency
of
the
commissioner
as
known
as
not
being
one
of
its
virtues,
rather,
it
doesn't
fall
consistently
in
theory.
now,
we
have
it
in
the
cases
preceding
our,
tank
truck
rentals.
he
argues
the
--
the
point
is
independently
illegal.
i
don't
know
what
could
be
more
independently
illegal,
your
honor,
whether
the
employees
are
specifically
told
to
go
out
and
violate
the
law.
it's
specifically
told
that
no
withholding
and
then
your
honor,
we
don't
find
the
commissioner
consistently
disallowing
the
salaries
of
those
employees.
objectively,
your
honor,
the
purpose
is
only
to
get
the
certain
types
of
business
as
annunciated
by
the
attorney
general.
now,
your
honor,
it
is
not
uniformly
applied
in
one
of
the
general
rules
of
taxation,
is
that
a
law
should
be
uniformly
applicable
and
it
should
be
applied
against
one
type
of
taxpayer
as
against
business
(inaudible).
now,
your
honor,
in
the
--
the
case
that
i
cited
before
about
the
lobbying,
fines
and
penalties,
the
--
under
the
theory
annunciated
by
the
commissioner.
these
types
of
expenses
are
not
allowed
to
those
engage
in
the
gaming
industry.
on
the
(inaudible)
case,
it
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
that
type
of
expense
and
the
type
of
expense
that
it
can
be
deducted.
it
specifically
points
out
to
bribery
and
fixing.
those
are
not
allowable
expenses.
now,
in
the
long
line
of
decisions
of
the
tax
court
and
even
including
the
silverman
case
relied
upon
by
the
commissioner
in
44
bta.
that
case
did
not
specifically
disallow
the
deduction
of
salaries
and
rents.
it
disallowed
the
taxpayer
the
right
to
claim
the
deduction
of
the
excess
losses,
which
he
derived
in
the
gambling
business
against
income
from
legal
sources.
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
find
all
these
other
cases
up
to
including
doyle
or
the
tax
court
that
was
up
to
1954
has
consistently
held
that
these
types
of
expenses
were
deductible
and
the
first
time
we
find
the
change
of
that
position
is
in
1954,
subsequent
of
the
time
when
the
attorney
general
had
made
a
statement
that
he
(inaudible)
highly
cooperation
of
the
treasury
department
in
invoking
this
particular
provision.
now,
your
honor,
the
original
letter
of
the
assessment
(inaudible)
in
sullivan
as
in
doyle.
there
was
no
disallowance
of
salaries
or
rent.
by
the
time
the
petitions
failed.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
in
either
the
doyle
or
in
this
--
in
the
lost
sullivan
case.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed,
it
did
not
involve
that
issue.
it
was
only
when
it
was
reached
at
the
trial
calendar,
that
the
commissioner
came
and
asked
for
leave
to
amend
this
petition
--
to
amend
those
answers
to
set
up
a
perimeter
of
the
matter.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
first
time
it
was
developed,
that
was
in
1954,
which
gives
the
import
to
a
particular
position
taken
by
the
department.
i'm
not
opposed
to
the
decision
taken
they
have
that
right
to
take
the
position
but
there
is
no
consistency
of
it
and
we
find
the
first
time
it
was
served
in
the
massei
case.
it
was
only
45
days
before
the
attorney
general
indicated
what
the
position
of
he
--
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
were
relative
to
his
expenses,
where
in
time
for
the
formulation
of
the
opinion
between
the
two
departments.
now,
public
policy,
your
honor
maybe
resulted
to
interpret
an
ambiguous
or
vague
statute.
now,
we
don't
have
that
vagueness
in
this
statute.
we
find
incidentally
--
i
can't
help
but
comment
on
the
ease
at
which
counsel
tries
to
obviate
to
the
faith
in
congress
of
1913.
says,
it
did
not
apply
to
the
gaming
statute.
may
i
read
from
the
congressional
record
3849,
1913
reference
to
which
we
made
in
our
brief?
senator
williams
said
this."
the
object
that
this
built
is
to
tax
a
man's
net
income."
that
is
to
say
what
he
has
at
the
end
of
the
year
after
deducting
from
his
receipts
of
the
expenditures
or
losses.
it
is
not
to
reform
men's
moral
characters.
that
is
not
the
object
of
the
bill.
the
tax
is
not
levied
for
the
purpose
of
--
people
from
betting
on
horses
or
upon
futures,
but
the
tax
is
plain
for
the
purpose
on
making
a
man
pay
upon
his
net
income,
his
actual
profit
during
the
year.
the
law
does
not
share
where
he
got
it
from,
so
far
as
the
tax
is
concerned,
although
the
law
may
very
properly
appear
in
another
way.
counsel
somewhat
slips
over
that,
as
was
well
as
he
did
to
senator
(inaudible).
in
senator
(inaudible)
proposal
which
are
followed
by
the
treasury
department
and
rejected
by
congress,
it
would
make
the
gaining
deductions
much
easier
of
determination.
all
that
the
commissioner
would
have
to
determine
--
that
congress
from
--
senator
(inaudible)
amend
and
accepted
was
whether
or
not
the
business
was
illegal
or
a
lawful
one.
we're
under
the
theory
annunciated
by
the
commission
of
independently
illegal.
it
will
be
necessary
to
determine
whether
each
item
of
expense
claimed
for
deduction
would
come
within
the
purview
of
section
23
(a)
(1)
(a).
as
i've
indicated,
your
honor,
here,
we
have
a
specific
provision
of
the
statute,
permitting
a
deduction,
permitting
the
deduction
of
all
necessary.
there
is
no
limitation.
there
is
no
limitation
as
--
let
me
quote
from
the
decision
in
commissioner
versus
heininger
that
judge
(inaudible)
held.
he
said
this
is
--
we
are
asked
in
the
guise
of
construing
the
words
ordinary
and
necessary
to
amend
the
statute,
in
other
words,
to
engage
in
a
little
judicial
legislation.
we
declined
the
invitation.
and
then
also
indicating
that
decision
of
a
change
was
to
be
made,
it
was
to
be
made
by
congress.
he
pointed
out
specifically
all
that
congress
had
to
do
was
to
add
in
one
word
in
between
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
is
lawful.
all
we
have
to
make
out
lawful
expense
as
incurred
in
any
trade
or
business
and
this
congress
repeatedly
rejected
it.
it
rejected
it
even
the
first
income
tax
law
passed
in
1913.
and
incidentally,
there
was
one
of
the
amendments
was
proposed
in
the
1913
act,
to
act
--
to
provide
that
all
--
only
deduction
maybe
plain
and
lawful
business
and
that
suggestion
of
senator
sterling
was
rejected,
same
as
the
similar
efforts
of
senator
(inaudible)
were
to
amend
the
bill,
the
wagering
excise
tax.
your
honor,
as
we
pointed
out,
we
have
not
only
that
gross
tax
on
wagering
under
the
wagering
act,
a
little
more
so
in
determining
gross
ordinarily
you
will
take
the
total
amount
wagered,
plus
the
amount
paid
off
on
the
wagers,
known
as
the
(inaudible)
and
then
the
balance
of
the
gross.
but
here,
we
taxed
the
total
amount,
not
gross
under
the
wagering
act.
now,
with
this
contention
of
the
commission
is
to
be
adhered
to,
we
find
another
gross
tax
with
a
mere
deduction
of
small
items
with
22%
of
the
total
expense
would
result
in
a
tax
of
net
income.
well,
i'll
leave
that
to
the
court
to
determine.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
he
was
on
the
--
he
was
on
the
senate,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
bernstein
yes,
it
was
indicated
--
i
couldn't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
believe
he
was
a
member
of
the
--
of
the
committee
on
the
taxation
(inaudible)
drive
that
from
the
general
debates.
well,
i
have
here
in
commerce.
now,
i
will
move
to
that
technically
in
the
brief
when
i
give
the
citation.
i
believe,
your
honors
has
pointed
out
(inaudible)
i'm
not
over
squeamish.
i
had
trouble
in
--
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
has
recently
held
that
sums
expended
by
american
businessmen
providing
foreign
officials
as
well
as
for
paying
rebates
to
representatives
of
foreign
governments
by
american
businessmen,
constitute
of
deductible
expense.
that
was
a
recent
ruling
that
he
gave,
i
believe
it
was
senator
williams
if
i'm
not
mistaken
(inaudible),
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that
appears
in
(inaudible)
in
1957.
however,
a
similar
deduction
launched
to
american
businessmen
are
not
--
is
not
allowed
for
that
type
of
expense
paid
to
domestic
officials.
now,
congress
is
the
--
pointed
out
as
a
sole
authority
to
modify
the
law
but
not
to
the
courts
or
to
the
commissioner
even
though
they
may
improve
upon
the
scheme
of
taxation.
and
another
theory
of
taxation,
your
honor,
is
that
the
income
tax
law
should
be
equal
in
its
administration
and
you
had
that
u.s
versus
(inaudible),
burnet
versus
harmel,
and
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
--
justice
--
well,
the
justice
of
our
supreme
court
versus
dolman
if
i
recall.
and
that
case,
your
honor,
was
the
--
the
judge
of
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
provisions
of
the
income
tax
law
will
not
(inaudible)
and
that
it
had
violated
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
illinois.
the
constitution
provided
for
the
(inaudible)
could
not
be
diminished
or
increased
during
his
term
of
office.
that
the
imposition
of
this
tax
will
tend
to
diminish
his
salary,
(inaudible)
made
short
statement
on
that
and
held
that
the
federal
laws
were
not
depending
upon
state
constitutions
or
upon
state
laws
and
their
application.
that
was
(inaudible)
and
i
cite
that
in
my
brief.
now,
your
honor,
in
conclusion,
may
i
make
this
observation?
this
should
be
allowed
as
a
deduction,
all
the
cost
and
expenses
necessarily
incurred
in
the
production
of
that
income.
that
is
the
cost
and
expenses
which
are
interwoven
in
the
fabric
of
the
business
to
make
fictitious
any
net
income
computed
without
regard
to
such
dispersions.
