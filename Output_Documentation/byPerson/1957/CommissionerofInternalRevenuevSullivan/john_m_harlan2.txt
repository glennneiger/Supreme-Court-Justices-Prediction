justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you,
if
that
is
correct,
if
it
is
your
position
that
every
expenditure
that
a
man
engaged
in
an
illegal
business
is
nondeductible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
could
you
keep
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
think
we
do.
i
see
no
escape.
the
government
taxes
an
illegal
business.
i
understand
your
premise
should
be
that
he
wanted
--
he
did
this
to
--
whether
it's
an
illegal
business
therefore
it's
not
deductible
and
you
also
referred
and
say
if
he
hired
somebody.
suppose
he
had
50
employees
in
there,
are
you
saying
he
couldn't
deduct
to
them
what
he
paid
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
would
that
be?
this
man
--
this
is
to
carry
on
his
business
--
his
business,
isn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
pay
money
for
this
building?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
order
to
run
a
gambling
establishment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
asked
you
that
because
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
that
i
hope
you'll
discuss.
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
the
first
time,
your
argument
means
that
the
law
that
the
--
that
federal
tax
law
is
applied
to
people
who
run
illegal
business.
it's
a
gross
tax
on
the
income
from
their
business
and
i
suppose
that
that
might
raise
a
rather
serious
question
of
constitutionality,
wouldn't
it?
