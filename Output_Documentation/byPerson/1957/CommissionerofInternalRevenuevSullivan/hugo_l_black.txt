justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
maybe
you
did
(inaudible)
as
i
gathered
from
your
argument.
the
man
was
running
a
gambling
establishment
and
that's
all
he
did.
he
got
six
employees.
every
dime
he
made
was
made
from
that
--
him
--
from
their
activities
in
connection
with
his
joint
violation
zone.
the
government
protects
his
income,
but
he
could
get
no
deduction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
maybe
my
illustration
is
a
little
exaggerated,
because
a
thought
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
be
married
that
he
get
an
exemption
from
his
wife.
but
he
couldn't
get
any
deduction
for
his
expenses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
he
take
depreciation
on
his
premises.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
authorizes
to
put
up
a
notice
in
his
gambling
house,
do
you
not
that
he
stays
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
any
difference
between
the
strength
of
your
position
in
this
case
and
in
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
not
get
into
that
in
the
other
cases,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
supposed
he
has
no
right
at
all.
he
has
no
right
to
do
it.
he's
just
an
outlaw.
he's
an
outlaw
in
getting
the
house.
he's
an
outlaw
in
purpose.
he's
an
outlaw
the
people
he
hires
and
he
gets
money
from
being
an
outlaw.
how
can
you
distinguish
between
one
kind
of
--
his
expenses
that
on
the
basis,
that
it's
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
don't
--
don't
you
get
beyond
the
question
of
deduction
here.
do
--
is
it
not
in
purpose
in
effect.
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
business.
there's
nothing
but
--
it
violates
the
law.
he
gets
no
money
from
anything
else.
he
makes
more
expenses
before
anything
else.
whatever
you
call
it.
isn't
that
a
gross
tax,
if
you
tax
him
on
all
the
income?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
--
in
ordinary
case
if
the
merchants
in
the
business
and
not
merely
do
business,
we
assume
that
the
employees
he
hires
who
work
for
him
are
needed
--
it's
only
when
you
show
that
he
did
not
need
them,
that
you
would
deprive
them
of
the
deduction,
which
--
what
he
paid
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
true
in
the
textile
mills
case,
but
there,
this
was
a
legitimate
business
engaged
in
the
legitimate
undertaking
to
point
out
he
had
an
isolated
transaction.
he
paid
out
the
money
for
something
which
we
said
violated
public
policy
and
he
shouldn't
have
a
deduction
that's
why
we
construed
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
like
this
one,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
who
was
--
who
was
the
taxpayer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
a
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
were
engaged
in
manufacturing
textile.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
taxed
separately?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
taxed
as
a
part
of
their
business,
growing
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
were
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
below
make
any
findings?
did
he
find
one
way
or
the
other
on
whether
this
was
necessary,
an
ordinary
expense
of
this
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
make
any
findings
on
that
--
the
tax
court.
did
it
find
whether
or
not
these
were
ordinary
andnecessary
business
expenses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
stop
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they
were
extraordinary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
ordinary
and
necessary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
nothing
here
that
--
no
finding
that
would
justify
an
argument,
that
maybe
he
didn't
need
to
hire
these
people
after
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
try
this
case
in
the
tax
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
tax
--
is
it
permissible
in
the
tax
court
to
request
that
findings
be
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
are
no
findings
on
this
point
and
that
several
of
our
cases
have
indicated
that
there
should
be
findings
on
that
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
findings
of
fact.
there
was
any
findings
of
fact
as
to
whether
this
particular
is
what's
necessary
for
him
to
run
his
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
finding,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
you
read
it
from
the
statement
of
senator
williams?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
connection
with
the
bill?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
he's
in
the
senate.
