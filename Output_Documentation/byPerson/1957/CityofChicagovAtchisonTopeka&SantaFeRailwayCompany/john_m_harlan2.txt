with
the
consequence
of
transfer
did
not
have
to
get
a
license
with
the
government?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
applied
for
a
license.
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
the
--
have
the
state
courts
ever
construe
this
ordinance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
is
--
one
is
in
dispute
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
want
to
get
myself
focused.
the
effect
of
this
ordinance,
as
i
understand
it,
was
on
the
one
hand
to
make
parmelee
eligible
for
an
interstation
license
which
it
would
not
have
been
eligible
--
which
it
would
not
have
been
eligible
under
the
preceding
ordinance.
and
in
converse
to
require
transfer
to
obtain
a
license
before
it
could
operate
under
its
contract
with
terminals,
is
that
right?
justice

justice
john
m.
harlan
but
under
the
old
ordinance,
the
old
ordinance
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
transfer
would
not
have
had
to
get
a
license
from
the
city.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
cancelled.
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i'm
still
confused.
i
thought
under
the
old
ordinance,
a
carrier
that
a
company
that
was
simply
carrying
interstation
passengers
was
not
subject
to
any
city
regulation
under
the
old
ordinance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
were.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
doing
both?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
the
areas
of
regulation
that
would
be
--
you
would
be
subject
to?
