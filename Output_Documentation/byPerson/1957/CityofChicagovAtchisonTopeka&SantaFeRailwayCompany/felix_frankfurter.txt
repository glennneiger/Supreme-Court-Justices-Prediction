justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
grossman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
it
trouble
you
if
i
ask
you,
what
it
is
that
the
lower
court
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
you
want
us
to
reverse?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
it
that
it
decided
that
you
think
is
wrong
and
what
is
it
that
you
want
us
to
decide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
urging
that
we
don't
know
what
the
ordinance
requires?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
be
so
sure
in
telling
us
what
it
does
require?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
i
understand
you
to
urge
that
the
federal
--
the
federal
courts
have
no
business
to
strike
down,
if
unconstitutional,
an
ordinance
or
any
other
act
of
legislation
of
a
state
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
a
construction
being
given
to
it
or
has
not
yet
been
given
to
it
by
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
better
stick
to
that
and
not
know
what
a
construction
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
that
does
it
follow
because
an
enterprise
is
subject
to
the
sherman
law
as
being
within
the
requirement
of
interstate
commerce
under
the
sherman
law
that
therefore,
the
state
is
wholly
supplanted
in
making
any
regulations
and
other
relation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
equation
between
amenability
to
the
sherman
law
in
exclusion
of
state
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
thought
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
all
i'm
saying
is
it
doesn't
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
sherman
law
excludes
the
state
from
action.
it
certainly
doesn't
exclude
this
from
taxation.
how
do
i
know
whether
it's
excluded
on
that
if
that
isn't
a
--
an
absolute
proposition
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
agree
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
go
on
from
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
transfer
before
us?
is
transfer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
agree
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
what
that
means
personally
if
the
city
of
chicago
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
grossman,
can
you
--
can
we
be
clear
about
this
thing
because
i'm
not
clear?
this
involved
the
lower
court
struck
down
an
ordinance
of
1955.
justice
felix
frankfurter
transfer
says
it
isn't
within
the
ordinance
and
you
agree
to
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
said
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
then
i
do
not
understand
that
there's
a
litigation
before
the
court
but
if
transfer
claims
a
right
which
you
recognize,
what
is
the
contest
as
between
chicago
and
transfer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
1955,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
in
your
view.
and
is
that
the
ordinance
before
us
or
there's
some
other
ordinance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it's
struck
down
but
the
other
ordinance,
is
that
before
us
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
the
case
you're
arguing,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
the
court
of
appeals
pass
on
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
as
i
understand
it,
transfer
--
the
position
of
transfer
under
the
1955
act
is
not
a
matter
of
controversy
between
you
and
transfer,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
whatever
other
rights
they
may
have,
the
lower
court
didn't
pass
on
it.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
understand
you
and
you
please
correct
me
because
i
can
assure
you
my
head
is
foggy
on
this
subject.
as
i
understand
you,
the
court
invalidated
an
ordinance
because
it
couldn't
be
made
applicable
to
transportation
companies
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
you
agree
with
that,
that
the
ordinance
doesn't
apply
to
that.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
ordinance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
a
matter
of
construction.
it
doesn't
apply
to
transfer.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
is
engaged
in
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
invalid
that
it
couldn't
apply
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
talking
about
transfer
for
the
moment
just
stick
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
so
as
far
as
transfer
is
concerned,
insofar
as
the
invalidation
was
rested
on
the
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
you
say
the
ordinance
doesn't
apply
to
transfer,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
some
other
--
under
the
prior
ordinance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it,
mr.
grossman,
so
we
can
follow
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
below
knocked
out
the
whole
ordinance,
did
it?
the
entire
ordinance,
mr.
grossman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
you
agree
that
the
--
insofar
as
invalidation
was
rested
on
interstate
commerce,
that
was
a
gratuitous
thing
because
the
ordinance
doesn't
apply
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
which
section
is
knocked
out
for
grounds
other
than
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
“but”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
that
was
really
not
an
issue
before
the
federal
court
because
the
ordinance
either
doesn't
--
or
the
existing
legal
authority
of
chicago
either
doesn't
or
we
don't
know
whether
it
does
give
monopoly
power?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
haven't
you
just
said
that
that's
the
reason
why
judge
schnackenberg
wrote
the
way
he
wrote?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
give
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
give
up
but
you've
said
that
that
isn't
the
contention
that
you
are
making.
you're
admitting
that.
and
if
it's
interstate
commerce
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
not
covered.
but
you
say,
nevertheless,
the
city,
for
reasons
of
policing
the
traffic
conditions
in
the
second,
if
it
is
the
second
largest
city
in
the
united
states,
i
don't
know
but
los
angeles
is
creeping
up
on
this,
that
for
police
reasons,
it
may
regulate
to
make
life
possible
in
the
city
of
chicago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
interfere
with
both
the
answer
you're
making
to
justice
brennan
and
your
own
argument
if
you
would
state
briefly
what
the
critical
condition
is
with
reference
to
these
facilities
of
going
from
one
station
to
another,
what
the
existing
situation
was,
what
the
ordinance
did,
what
you
object
to
in
the
ordinance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
part
of
the
tariff
ticket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
absorbed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mathews.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
not
to
interrupt
the
course
of
your
--
the
sequence
of
your
argument
by
asking
whether
you
understood
that
i
understood
mr.
grossman
on
behalf
of
the
city,
state
to
this
court
that
28-31.1,
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
provision,
does
not
apply,
is
not
in
conflict.
he
didn't
say
specifically
202
(c)
(2)
but
that
is
the
effect
of
what
he
said,
namely,
that
since
that
is
covered,
that
that
is
an
interstate
commerce
operation,
it
does
not
require
as
typically
convenience,
is
it?
if
that
was
so,
then
the
conflict
with
202
(c)
disappears,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
position
of
the
lower
courts?
can
they
rule
that
28-31.1
does
apply?
and
if
they
have
so
ruled,
is
there
a
ruling
to
govern
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
don't
know
what
the
ruling
of
the
illinois
courts
would
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
i'm
probably
contented.
if
he's
right,
then
this
argument
disappears.
if
he's
right
as
a
matter
of
law,
then
this
argument
of
conflict
with
202
(c)
(2)
disappears.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that's
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
one
more
thing
that
he
said.
whether
he's
right
or
wrong,
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
not
yet
spoken
and
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
might
tomorrow
so
speak,
then
we've
got
the
kind
of
a
problem
that
we've
--
to
which
we've
adverted
several
times
in
over
the
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
took
your
time
indeed
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i'll
leave
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
was
that
like
the
union
station
here
i
believe?
was
that
a
corporation
in
which
all
the
railroads
had
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
it's
relevant,
it
wouldn't
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wanted
to
ask
whether
prior
to
june
30,
1955,
parmelee
was
the
exclusive
terminal
vehicle
service
as
between
the
railroad
terminal
in
chicago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
that
because
of
202
(c)
(2)
or
that
is
to
allow
the
railroads
to
define
by
the
tariff
who
shall
do
the
shuttling?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
the
exclusiveness
doesn't
derive
from
that.
the
exclusiveness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
exclusiveness
--
the
exclusiveness
so
far
as
the
railroads
are
concerned,
derives
from
the
contract,
but
does
that
exclude
anybody
else
within
chicago?
and
if
it
did,
if
that
exclusiveness
doesn't
--
did
the
city
of
chicago
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
did
the
city
of
chicago
say,
“we
won't
authorize
other
people
to
do
that
carriage
between
the
termini?
take
for
instance,
who
don't
take
--
who
take
interstate
carriers
who
do
not
have
a
through
ticket.
i'm
probably
assuming
an
unreal
situation,
but
take
a
person
who
comes
in
from
out
of
chicago,
out
of
illinois
into
chicago
and
then
transfers
to
another
railroad,
buys
another
ticket
and
get
to
new
york.
and
of
course,
that's
very
unreal.
could
he
--
could
he
or
she
pick
up
some
taxi
without
any
contract
relation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
service
that
the
vehicles
that
are
allowed
to
coast
around
the
different
termini
maybe
regulated
by
chicago
even
though
it
involved
interstate
transfers.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i'm
asking
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
want
to
put
the
question
clearly
if
i
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now
by
what
--
how
did
it
come
that
parmelee
was
that
exclusive
service
for
that
transfer
from
one
terminus
to
another?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
chicago
acquiesced,
though
it
need
not
have
acquiesced,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
have
any
say
in
the
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
that
within
the
power
of
chicago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
become
relevant
to
this
question,
mr.
mathews.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
who
hasn't?
or
who
hasn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
can't
it
say
for
traffic
consideration,
if
that
is
conceivable,
that
we
want
to
give
a
choice
to
the
mass
or
to
the
3900
people
who
pour
into
chicago
everyday
because
the
actual
service
of
traffic
--
of
shuttling,
which
the
railroads
are
providing
by
their
own
arrangements,
don't
seem
to
be
adequate,
block
the
traffic,
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
taxis
in
chicago
at
this
terminal
--
are
they
local
--
yellow
or
some
other
taxi
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
can't
come
in
to
this
terminus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
it
that
you
wanted
to
stop
parmelee
from
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
getting
a
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
on
the
assumption.
that
is
on
the
assumption
that
mr.
grossman's
position
here
for
the
necessity
of
finding
out
whether
his
position
is
right
or
wrong
has
to
be
determined
by
illinois
courts
subject
to
that
to
which
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
thinking
of
a
case
like
expected
that
we
had
some
years
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
we
are
troubled
if
we
have
the
law
preserve
the
city
of
chicago,
a
city
with
a
great
deal
of
assurance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
wonder
--
i'm
always
troubled
by
estoppel
arguments
that
i
gather
from
judge
labuy's
memorandum
that
before
him,
you
urged
that
you
are
not
included
within
the
condemnation
because
of
the
fact
that
this
is
interstate
commerce.
is
that
correct?
at
least
judge
labuy
said
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
last
point
urged
by
plaintiff
is
that
the
ordinance
did
not
intend
to
include
the
public
on
or
exclusively
devoted
to
interstate
(voice
overlap)
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
you
made
that
contention,
one
might
infer
that
it
isn't
a
wholly
frivolous
contention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
your
position?
what
kind
of
authority
if
you
were
a
party
in
the
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
argue
that
or
leave
it
on
the
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
your
judgment
to
control.
i'm
just
wondering
whether
you
think
it's
--
it's
a
seriously
(inaudible)
question
as
it
is
and
i
for
once
should
like
to
hear.
if
you
think
the
frost
case
controlled
it
economically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
it
true
that
there
was
only
one
license
outstanding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
license
--
the
only
license
outstanding,
was
that
a
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
true
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
makes
no
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
--
under
the
tariffs
filed
by
the
railroad,
today,
tomorrow
include
other
terminal
vehicle
enterprises?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
tariffs
which
the
railroads
have
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
today
or
tomorrow
or
could
they
--
the
day
after
this
complaint
was
filed
have
given
their
patronage
to
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
tariffs
by
--
are
the
tariffs
of
these
railroads
in
the
record?
or
can
you
tell
us
whether
in
the
tariffs
filed
including
this
absorbed
shuttling
service
formally
and
previously
and
now
transfer
was
specifically
mentioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
all
the
railroads
does
is
to
include
this
as
the
--
the
true
rate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
the
series
of
parmelee
into
288
i.c.c.
so
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you
what
that
decide
or
doesn't
decide.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
commission
could
exercise
but
has
not
chosen
to
exercise
power
over
parmelee
in
that
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
--
what
kind
of
exercise
of
power
would
they
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
deal
with
physical
aspects.
they
actually
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
vehicle,
the
type
of
vehicle
and
all
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
sought
to
be
done
by
that
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
they
dismissed
it
and
ordered
to
continue
on
the
proceeding
will
be
entered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
was
the
proceeding
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
a
physical
character
or
--
or
the
inter-contract
relation
between
the
railroad
and
the
parmelee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
i'm
not
asking
for
motives.
i'm
continuing
the
question
put
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
justice
black
as
to
the
extent,
as
to
the
extent
of
taking
over
by
the
commission
of
aspects
of
this
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
put
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
put
to
you
another
question
whether
anything
in
the
filed
tariff
until
it
changed
by
the
carriers
from
having
free
such
terminal
service
and
the
answer
--
your
answer
was
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
having
transfer
and
also
parmelee
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
gathered
from
what
you've
said
that
if
the
commission
could
choose
to
restrict
that
inter-terminal
--
inter-terminal
service
to
one
such
service
carrier.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
--
what
was
that
case
(inaudible)
he
wrote,
that
the
power
is
dormant
and
not
being
exercised,
the
police
power
can
--
can
move
in
that
area
until
the
commission
displaces
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
matthews,
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
think
it
will
make
a
difference
if
instead
of
the
chicago
city
council
or
the
commerce
commission
of
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it's
a
matter
of
conflict
that
makes
a
difference
who
the
agency
is
that
the
state
has
chosen
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
the
police
power
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
nobody
would.but
my
question
is
rather
the
suggestion
which
for
practical
purposes
i'm
ready
to
accept
that
considerations
that
may
move
the
city
council,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
city
council
of
chicago.
i
don't
want
to
be
discriminating
or
new
york
(inaudible)
whatnot.
i
want
to
know
whether
the
constitution
would
make
a
difference
whether
the
state's
choice
of
the
agent
in
exercising
as
it
claims
its
police
power
varied
it
because
pursuit
the
agency
that
it
has
chosen
is
much
more
likely
to
be
governed
by
political
considerations
than
a
supposedly
judicial-minded
administrative
agency.
do
you
think
this
court
can
say,
"well,
we
know
the
city
council
of
chicago
will
be
guided
by
considerations,"
they're
rather
political
where
the
commerce
commission
of
illinois
would
be
guided
by
more
or
less
objective
considerations.
do
you
think
we
can
take
that
--
take
that
line?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
essential
in
this
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
see
a
lot
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
it's
a
discretion
within
the
allowable
area
by
which
a
body
exercise
discretion.
that's
equally
true
of
the
board
of
alderman
or
a
city
council
or
administrative
agency
or
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
who
is
this
court
to
tell
illinois
or
any
other
states
who
is
likely
to
give
objective
judgment
on
a
question
within
the
state
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
proper
issue
but
i
do
not
understand
that
we
can
say,
so
that
i
can
say,
merely
because
i
can
take
practical
notice
of
the
fact
that
a
city
council
is
likely
to
be
all
political
and
i'm
not
that
sure
about
that
either.
then
the
administrative
agency
of
the
state
that
therefore
the
power
vested
in
the
city
council
would
be
bad
or
it
might
be
good
if
vested
into
the
so-called
"administrative
agency".
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
understand
that
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
illinois,
do
you
know
whether
the
city
council
hasn't
licensing
authority
of
all
sorts
of
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
cities
of
--
cities
of
united
states
have
full
of
licensing
powers
in
--
in
city
council
or
the
like.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judicial
review
--
is
there
any
difference
between
reviewing
or
withholding
of
a
license
for
a
wrong
ground
that
in
--
was
deemed
to
be
installed
or
i
mean,
vesting
power,
where
the
city
council
or
some
other
agencies
that
has
licensing
power,
if
there
is
review
for
arbitrary
conduct.
the
city
council
is
amenable
to
such
review
as
any
other
body.
isn't
that
true?
it
can't
review.
you
can't
review
of
course
political
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
pass
an
ordinance
but
if
this
illinois
legislature
vests
either
directly
or
by
a
whole
rule
charter,
i
don't
know
anything
about
chicago.
if
a
state
vests
licensing
power
in
the
city
council
and
it
exercises
that
licensing
power
for
a
wholly
arbitrary
reason,
i
should
think
judicial
review
would
apply
to
that
just
the
same
as
those
to
commission
of
licenses
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
or
if
it's
--
it's
unconstitutional
if
it's
arbitrary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
we
won't
give
this
to
a
jew
or
a
catholic
or
a
negro.
you
could
go
into
the
federal
court
and
say
that's
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
these
--
all
of
my
questions
are
directed
to
the
suggestion
that
if
there
is
power
in
the
state
and
the
city
has
power
because
it's
given
by
the
state,
then
i
don't
think
it
can
make
a
difference
whether
it's
vested
in
an
agency
that
is
much
more
amenable,
that
is
more
amenable
to
political
influence
than
some
other
agencies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
bother
about
it.
you've
dealt
with
it
adequately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
it
that
chicago
is
trying
to
do
that
bars
the
railroads
from
carrying
out
the
mandated
of
the
commission,
its
mandated
to
be
that
it
should
give
in
the
court
inter-station
transport?
what
is
it
that
chicago
has
done
or
seeks
to
do
that
precludes
the
railroad
from
doing
what
the
commissioner
says
they're
required
to
do
namely
to
carry
people
from
one
station
to
another?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
i
--
if
i
come
into
chicago
and
i
want
to
go
from
one
station
to
another
to
get
to
new
york
or
to
boston,
is
there
anything
that
chicago
has
--
is
trying
to
do
that
precludes
my
getting
that
service
from
the
railroad?
is
there
anything
that
chicago
is
doing
that
precludes
my
getting
a
service
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
says
i'm
entitled
to
get,
to
have
myself
taken
from
one
station
to
another?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
chicago
doesn't
say
you
can't
have
some
rent
for
service
carrying
me.
it
merely
--
it
merely
defines
the
choice
you
have
as
to
who
should
be
doing
that
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
wasn't
--
that
isn't
what
the
--
what's
the
name
of
that
in
chicago,
in
the
illinois
case?
the
hayes
case
was.
with
the
hayes
case,
with
the
latter
certificate,
he
could
do
business
and
illinois
said,
“no,
you
can't
do
business
anymore.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
put
it
to
you,
mr.
matthews.
in
the
hill
case,
this
court
held
that
congress
had
laid
down
certain
conditions,
certain
qualifications
for
officers
of
the
union
and
further
tried
to
add
that
too.
and
this
court
said,
when
congress
says
conditions
one,
two,
three
of
the
conditions,
it's
presumably
thought
those
were
all
the
conditions
that
were
necessary
and
part
of
that
act,
four
or
five.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
conditions
does
the
interstate
commerce
actually
have
done
here
other
than
to
say
that
in
a
situation
like
chicago,
you
may
engage
in
inter-station
transfer.
it
is
authorizing
to
give
that
service
but
what
have
it
said
about
choosing
the
means
of
carrying
out
that
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
get
to
that,
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
you
do
not
also
agree
unless
i
misapprehended
your
argument
in
103
that
complies
to
use
of
this
ordinance
lies
in
the
fact
that
parmelee,
by
a
practical
operation,
is
given
the
grandfather
license.
and
therefore,
i
ask
whether
that
provision
was
out
so
that
parmelee
would
stand
on
the
same
footing
or
transfer
would
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
everybody
else,
namely,
for
police
reasons
as
i
call
it
or
traffic
conditions,
etcetera.
everybody
has
to
get
a
license
and
nobody
gets
an
advantage,
you'd
have
a
different
situation,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
matthews,
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong
in
thinking
as
you
talk
that
202
(c)
(2)
in
effect
says
"you
don't
need
to
get
a
license
with
the
federal
government."
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
says
--
it
says
202,
although
you're
a
trucker,
you
don't
have
to
get
a
trucker's
license
what
other
truckers
have
to
get.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
tell
me
why
that's
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
make
that
selection
and
you
don't
have
to
come
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
way
other
people
who
do
that
service
do
have
to
come
and
get
a
license
on
under
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
part
2
of
the
1940
act.
section
202
(c)
(2)
released
these
inter-station
carriers
from
getting
--
from
being
required
to
get
the
license
that
are
under
part
2
of
the
transportation
act
as
required
by
other
people
who
do
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
the
question
is
what's
the
nature
of
their
ideas
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
scope
of
it
and
i
say
that
although
we've
got
a
provision
of
the
transportation
act
which
said
that
a
person
who
does
--
who
does
the
interstate
carriage
of
the
kind
that
inter-station
service
people
do
in
chicago,
they
do
not
need
a
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
need
a
statute.
the
answer
--
the
suggested
answer
is
that
202
(c)
(2)
is
immaterial
because
the
commerce
clause
gives
you
that
untrammeled
choice,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
forget
about
applied
in
1940.
if
you
claim
this
as
an
exercise
of
the
--
as
a
right
to
carry
on
interstate
commerce
into
which
the
state
can't
cut
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
--
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it's
under
the
commerce
clause
that
no
statute
can
save
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
a
right
under
the
commerce
clause
then
no
statute
can
take
it
away,
no
state
statute
can
take
it
away.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
(voice
overlap)
of
your
position.
