mr.

you

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grossman,
would
it
bother
you
to
--
to
give
a
short
recital
of
the
facts
chronologically
here
so
we
could
all
--
all
be
oriented?
i
think
it's
obvious
that
we're
--
that
we're
not
quite
oriented
on
the
facts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
mathews.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
if
you
get
to
the
facts
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
you
tell
us
what
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
that
the
one
having
to
do
with
the
convenience
and
necessity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
do
it
if
you
have
it.
if
you
have
through
tickets,
you
can
do
just
the
same,
could
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mathews,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
is
it
conceded
by
both
sides
that
under
this
opinion
of
the
court
below,
parmelee
can
continue
to
transfer
passengers
from
one
station
to
another,
only,
it
does
it
on
its
own
independently
and
not
by
contract
with
the
--
with
the
railroads?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
mr.
--
mr.
grossman
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
i
just
had
an
agreement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
this
does
not
put
parmelee
out
of
business
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
if
they
can
still
operate
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
can
still
operate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
take
the
position
in
this
court
that
this
is
just
a
fight
between
parmelee
and
transfer?

i
beg
your

chief

i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
--
is
this
going
to
take
an
hour
to
recite
after
what
we've
gone
through?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
red
light
comes,
mr.
kurland.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
we'll
recess
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kurland,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
under
this
ordinance
to
--
do
the
taxicab
companies
transport
passengers
from
one
station
to
another,
are
they
obliged
to
take
out
this
particular
license?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
yes.
so
they're
not
--
it
isn't
applicable
to
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kurland,
you
make
no
distinction
between
the
--
the
public
necessity
and
convenient
provision
of
the
ordinance
and
the
other
ones
that
counsel
referred
to
as
--
as
police
regulations.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
they're
subject
to
any
distinction
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
did
--
it
didn't
follow
--
it
didn't
act
that
way
in
that
case,
did
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
turned
out
the
other
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this?
is
there
any
distinction
between
this
case
in
the
--
in
the
bradley
case
in
that
--
in
this
case
not
only
as
a
finding
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
but
also
after
that
there
must
be
a
political
decision
as
to
whether
it
will
be
granted
to
that
party
by
the
city
council?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
was
saying
--
there's
one
--
it
might
be
one
thing
for
the
--
the
city
to
say
that
anybody
seeking
such
a
license
was
established
if
there's
a
public
necessity
for
it
and
that
there
must
be
a
finding
to
that
effect.
but
i
think
there's
an
added
element,
isn't
there
when
they
say
even
after
that
has
been
found
that
it
then
rest
with
a
body
in
its
discretion
as
to
whether
it
will
be
granted.
now,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
that
--
was
there
such
an
element
in
the
bradley
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
matthews.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
illinois,
is
there
--
is
there
any
review
at
all
of
the
discretion
of
the
city
council
in
adopting
or
rejecting
ordinances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
even
assuming
that
--
that
they
have
the
right
--
assuming
they
have
the
right
to
do
it
and
the
city
council
denies
--
denies
the
right
by
a
refusal
to
pass
an
ordinance.
can
there
be
any
--
any
review
in
the
state
of
illinois
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
such
refusal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
they
just
--
if
they
just
said
in
spite
of
--
of
a
favorable
ruling
by
the
commissioner
on
the
necessity
and
public
necessity
and
convenience,
it
said
no
by
a
vote
of
so
many,
so
maybe
--
so
maybe
won't
--
we
won't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pass
the
ordinance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
there
be
any
review.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
it
would
take
the
--
the
ordinary
board
of
commerce,
public
utilities
or
whatever
it
is.
they're
usually
subject
to
some
kind
of
judicial
review
as
to
whether
they
have
abused
their
discretion
and
so
forth,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kurland.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
kurland.
