mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
this
case
is
here
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
suit
was
instituted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
by
21
frontline
railroads
operating
to
and
from
the
city
of
chicago
in
the
interstate
commerce
and
in
the
intrastate
commerce.
and
the
respondent,
railroad
transfer
service,
incorporated
hereafter
called
“transfer”
for
short,
an
uncertified
motor
carrier
transferring
passengers
between
terminal
facilities
of
the
various
railroads
of
which
there
were
i
think
eight
in
number
in
the
city
of
chicago.
none
of
the
railroads
pass
through
the
city
of
chicago.
there
are
eight
terminals.
two
of
them
on
the
west
side
of
the
chicago
river
and
six
of
them
on
the
south
and
east
side
of
the
chicago
river,
some
distance
south.
the
distance
between
the
terminals
vary
from
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
two
miles
distance.
the
case
involved
the
construction
or
in
the
alternative
as
the
pleading
showed,
the
constitutionality
of
a
city
ordinance
licensing
the
--
and
regulating
the
use
of
the
city
streets
by
a
motor
vehicle
for
hire.
the
ordinance
was
known
as
chapter
28
of
the
municipal
court
of
chicago
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
--
beginning
at
page
171.
parmelee
transportation
company,
another
uncertified
motor
carrier
intervened
in
the
case.
the
parmelee
company
having
--
have
a
contract
of
the
railroads
to
operate
at
the
--
the
motor
vehicles
in
the
transfer
of
passengers
in
interstate
commerce
and
intrastate
commerce
prior
to
the
termination
of
that
contract
and
the
substitution
of
the
railroad
transfer
service.
at
that
time
until
--
october
1,
1955,
the
terminal
line
had
a
contract
arrangement
with
parmelee
as
i
said
to
furnish
their
service.
but
that
operation
was
not
limited
to
interstation
service
on
through
route
railroad
carriers.
it
also
carried
passengers
for
cash
fares
between
terminal
stations
and
from
substations
to
hotels
and
other
places
within
the
central
business
district
of
the
city
of
chicago.
parmelee's
operations
were
licensed
as
terminal
vehicles
under
the
city
code
relating
to
the
public
passenger
vehicles,
the
licensing
of
public
passenger
vehicles.
at
that
time,
referring
to
the
ordinance,
a
public
passenger
vehicle
was
defined
by
the
code
as
a
motor
vehicle
which
is
used
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
for
hire
accepting
those
devoted
exclusively
for
funeral
use
or
any
operation
of
a
metropolitan
transit
authority
or
public
utility
under
the
laws
of
illinois
and
the
terminal
vehicle
was
defined
as
a
public
passenger
vehicle
which
is
operated
under
contracts
with
the
railroad
and
steamship
companies
exclusively
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
from
terminal
stations.
then
section
28-2
provided,
it
is
unlawful
for
any
person
other
than
the
metropolitan
transit
authority
or
public
utility
to
operate
any
vehicle
or
for
any
such
person
who
is
the
owner
of
any
vehicle
to
permit
it
to
be
operated
on
any
public
way
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
for
hire
from
place
to
place
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
except
on
a
funeral
trip
unless
it
is
licensed
by
the
city
as
a
public
passenger
vehicle.
those
are
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
ordinance
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
parmelee's
operations
as
i
said
were
licensed
as
terminal
vehicles.
early
in
june
1955,
the
terminal
lines
notified
parmelee
that
their
contractual
arrangement
would
be
terminated
and
other
provision
made
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
on
through
route
tickets
between
terminal
stations
in
chicago.
on
july
26,
1955,
the
city
council
passed
an
ordinance
amending
the
city
code
by
eliminating
the
requirement
of
a
contractual
arrangement
with
railroad
companies
to
qualify
terminal
vehicles
for
license
and
limiting
the
number
of
such
vehicles
to
those
licensed
unless
after
a
public
hearing
is
provided
by
the
ordinance,
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
additional
service
of
the
character
described.
that
provision
in
the
ordinance
was
the
--
in
2231-1
or
28
--
no,
excuse
me,
it
was
28-31.1,
chapter
28.
it
was
amended
at
the
same
time
that
the
definition
of
terminal
vehicles
was
amended
and
also
the
section
relating
to
the
operation
of
terminal
route
vehicles
which
was
limited
to
the
central
business
district
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
it
provided
for
a
determination
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
prior
to
the
issuance
of
any
licenses
for
additional
terminal
vehicles.
now,
parmelee
was
then
operating
of
course
not
in
the
transfer
of
passengers
on
through
routes
either
in
intrastate
commerce
or
interstate
commerce.
it
was
operating
after
termination
of
its
contract
as
a
local
public
passenger
vehicle.
still
under
license,
transporting
for
a
cash
fare,
passengers
who
happened
to
be
at
any
railroad
station
to
the
hotels
and
to
any
destination
which
the
passenger
himself
directed.
the
case
was
submitted
in
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
the
construction
of
the
contract
both
by
the
complaints
and
by
the
motion
of
the
city
of
chicago
for
summary
judgment.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
city
of
chicago
requested
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
plaintiff
by
virtue
of
its
contract
with
the
plaintiff
railroad
company
is
operating
its
vehicles
within
the
city
of
chicago
as
exclusively
as
agent
born
in
behalf
of
plaintiff
railroads
as
public
utilities
under
the
law
of
illinois,
whether
the
plaintiff's
operations
are
confined,
the
transportation
of
passengers
on
through
route
railroad
and
steamship
transportation
tickets
between
point
out
--
points
outside
of
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
in
intrastate
and
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
of
course
or
the
railroads
and
the
transfer
company,
the
railroad
transfer
corporation
under
the
new
contract
and
whether
said
the
plaintiff
operates
any
vehicle
on
any
public
way
for
transportation
of
passenger
for
hire
from
place
to
place
within
the
court
limits
of
the
city
as
provided
by
section
28-2
of
the
municipal
court
of
chicago,
whether
said
plaintiff
is
operating
terminal
vehicles
within
the
city
of
chicago
as
defined
in
section
28-1
of
the
municipal
court
of
chicago
as
amended
in
1955,
whether
any
of
the
said
plaintiff's
operations
are
in
local
transportation
of
passengers
at
rates
of
fares
subject
to
section
28-31.2
of
the
municipal
court
of
chicago.
now,
i
ought
to
make
reference
to
28-31.2
to
indicate
what
kind
of
an
operation
it
brought
because
under
the
powers
of
the
city
council
in
the
city
of
chicago,
the
city
has
the
right
to
determine
the
rates
of
fare
of
these
passenger
vehicles.
and
28-31.2
provides
that
the
rate
of
fare
for
local
transportation
of
every
passenger
in
terminal
vehicles
of
the
licensee
shall
be
uniform
regardless
of
the
distance
traveled
provided
that
children
under
12
years
of
age,
when
accompanied
by
an
adult,
shall
be
carried
not
more
than
half
the
fare.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
lower
--
the
district
court
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
yes,
the
district
court
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
all
right.
the
district
court
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
ordinance
of
1955
was
unconstitutional
because
section
28-31.1
providing
for
the
determination
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
was
invalid
as
non-constitutional
control
by
the
city
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
with
the
consequence
of
transfer
would
--
did
not
have
to
have
a
license.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it
had
not
applied
for
a
license.
and
the
point
to
that
i
make
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
28-31.1,
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
provision
gave
parmelee
in
effect
a
monopoly
of
the
streets
of
the
city
of
chicago
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
between
terminal
stations.
whereas
the
point
i
make
is
that
28-31.1
was
applicable
to
parmelee
because
it
was
a
local
transportation
facility
after
the
enactment
of
the
amendment,
but
28-31.1
could
not
be
applicable
to
the
transport
corporation
because
it
was
under
the
--
under
its
contract
exclusively
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
between
terminal
stations
in
intrastate
and
interstate
commerce.
and
so
far
as
the
intrastate
commerce
is
concerned
of
course,
there's
no
question
about
there
ever
having
been
required
to
have
a
license
and
even
so
far
as
the
interstate
commerce
is
concerned.
they're
--
they
are
subject
to
license.
the
power
of
the
city
to
license
that
kind
of
an
operation
within
the
city
of
chicago
even
though
they
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
is
there
--
the
question
is
did
they
exercise
that
power.
now,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
the
appeals,
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
decided
what
was
the
intent
of
the
city
council
in
passing
this
ordinance
of
1955
and
permit
me
--
whether
permit
me
to
read
and
extract
from
the
opinion
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
my
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
do.
i
--
i
contend
the
transfer
should
make
an
application
for
a
license
and
that
the
city
authorities
should
pass
upon
the
questions
to
whether
they
can
be
licensed
or
they
cannot
be
licensed
and
if
the
decision
were
against
the
transfer
company.
the
transfer
company
should
then
commence
a
suit
in
the
state
courts
to
have
the
state
courts
determine
the
meaning
or
the
construction
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
your
honor.
this
ordinance
has
not
been
construed
by
the
--
by
the
state
court.
this
particular
ordinance,
i'm
talking
about
the
1955
ordinance
had
not
been
construed.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
--
the
basic
ordinance
has
been
construed
by
the
supreme
court,
yes.
the
basic
ordinance
was
construed
by
the
supreme
court
in
taxi
cab
cases.
in
the
taxi
cab
cases,
they
provided
for
a
--
a
finding
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
just
exactly
as
it's
provided
here
for
the
terminal
vehicles.
but
the
terminal
vehicles
in
this
particular
case
are
the
terminal
vehicles
without
a
contractual
arrangement
with
the
railroad.
it's
--
it's
purely
a
local
transportation
facility.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
provision
for
terminal
vehicles
applied
to
transfer
but
that
it
was
unconstitutional
because
of
the
restriction.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes,
it
is
a
shuttle
but
that's
not
the
definition.
that
is
not
the
definition
of
the
terminal
vehicle
now.
terminal
vehicle
is
merely
another
local
transportation
facility.
this
court
in
the
u.s.
versus
yellow
cab
company,
distinguished
between
the
local
transportation
and
the
interstate
transportation
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
yellow
cab
against
--
united
states
against
yellow
cab,
332
u.s.
218.
the
--
but
i'm
--
i'll
come
to
that
because
what
the
court
did
was
to
construe
the
ordinance
in
the
light
of
what
was
said
at
a
committee
meeting
of
the
city
council.
and
i
want
--
i
think
that's
a
very
important
thing
that
i
want
to
come
to.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
invoked
by
our
respondents
in
defense
of
the
right
of
transfer
to
operate
motor
vehicles
for
compensation
in
the
city
of
chicago
without
a
license,
should
have
been
considered
by
the
courts
below
before
the
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
and
judicial
remedies
to
determine
whether
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
provisions
of
the
1955
ordinance
are
applicable
to
transfer's
operations.
the
commerce
clause
became
the
decisive
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
assumption
that
the
standards
for
determining
whether
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
additional
terminal
vehicle
service,
apply
to
transfer's
operation
and
were
intended
to
grant
parmelee
a
monopoly
of
the
use
of
the
city
streets
for
interstation
transportation
service.
i
refer
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
is
attached
to
the
petition
for
--
petition
for
certiorari
and
on
page
50
where
the
court
said,
“we
are
convinced
that
those
provisions
that
is
in
section
28-31.1,
which
would,
in
effect,
limit
the
number
of
terminal
vehicle
licenses
to
those
held
by
parmelee
on
july
26,
1955,
and
give
parmelee
perpetual
control
thereof,
constitute
a
designation
of
parmelee
by
the
counsel
of
the
city,
in
lieu
of
transfer,
the
instrumentality
selected
by
the
terminal
lines
rather
than
the
exercise
of
the
city's
police
power
over
traffic.
in
this
critical
aspect,
the
1955
ordinance
is
invalid.
if
there
were
any
doubt
that
this
conclusion
is
correct,
the
legislative
history
of
the
ordinance
dispels
that
doubt.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
i
could
--
you
have
it
turned
around.
the
purpose
of
the
new
ordinance,
the
1955
ordinance,
which
was
an
amendment
of
an
old
ordinance
by
which
parmelee
did
have
a
contract
for
the
railroads
to
perform
this
interstation
service
in
intrastate
and
interstate
commerce.
it
was
amended
so
that
the
parmelee
operation
became
a
--
a
local
transportation
service
only.
that
is
to
carry
passengers
for
cash
fares
from
railroad
stations
or
steamships
dock
to
any
place
within
the
city
of
chicago
-
within
the
central
business
district
of
the
city
of
chicago.
and
the
transfer
operation
was
by
contract
with
the
railroads
exclusively
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
between
stations,
to
carry
railroad
passengers
between
these
stations
while
on
a
--
on
a
through
route
ticket
and
a
thoroughfare
ticket.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
do
i
make
myself
clear?
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
under
the
old
ordinance
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no.under
the
old
ordinance,
transfer
--
transfer
couldn't
get
a
license
because
railroad
--
the
railroads
had
an
exclusive
contract
with
parmelee.
they
had
an
exclusive
contract
with
parmelee
but
the
contract
was
not
exclusively
for
the
transfer
of
passengers.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that
was
cancelled.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes,
they
were.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
parmelee
was
under
--
parmelee
was
under
the
city
regulation
and
had
city
licenses.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
and
had
a
contract
with
the
railroad.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
doing
--
doing
both.
yes.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
all
right.
yesterday,
i
attempted
to
describe
the
operations
of
terminal
vehicles
by
parmelee
from
railroad
terminal
to
any
destination
in
the
central
business
district
of
chicago
pursuant
through
licenses
under
a
city
ordinance
before
and
after
amendment
in
july
1955.
passengers
were
accepted
by
parmelee
for
such
transportation
indiscriminately
upon
surrender
of
a
coupon
issued
by
a
railroad
for
transfer
between
terminals
or
upon
payment
of
the
cash
fare
without
identification
as
railroad
passengers.
since
transfer
was
substituted
for
parmelee
under
the
contracts
with
the
railroads,
exclusively
for
the
transfer
of
railroad
passengers
between
terminal
stations
on
through
route
tickets
or
coupons.
transfer
commenced
operations
under
its
contracts
without
application
for
a
license.
that
was
--
that's
the
situation
as
it
is
today.
now,
the
power
of
the
city
to
exercise
its
local
police
powers
in
the
regulation
of
transfer's
operations
is
conceded
by
all
concerned.
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
52
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
a
quotation
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“highways,
being
public
property,
users
of
them,
although
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce,
are
subject
to
regulation
by
the
state
or
municipality
to
ensure
safety
and
convenience,
and
the
conservation
of
the
highways."
now,
the
court
relied
upon
the
history
of
the
legislation
to
show
that
what
the
intention
of
the
city
council
was,
was
to
grant
to
parmelee
a
perpetual
and
exclusive
right
to
perform
the
service
which
transfer
is
now
performing
without
a
license.
and
the
facts
are,
however,
the
referent
part
was
to
proceedings
before
the
committee
of
the
city
council
at
the
time
the
ordinance
was
introduced.
on
page
90
to
92
is
a
correct
transcript
of
the
proceedings
by
court
reporters
as
to
what
happened
at
the
time
of
the
introduction
of
an
ordinance
which
originally
was
a
grant
or
a
franchise
--
a
special
franchise
to
parmelee,
exclusively
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
to
and
from
terminal
stations,
that's
on
page
85,
and
exclusive
permission
and
authority
was
granted
for
a
period
of
10
years.
now,
i
went
before
the
committee
and
my
remarks
were
misinterpreted,
i
think,
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
clerk
who
took
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
down.
i
said
that
the
ordinance,
that
is
the
franchise
ordinance,
was
presented
to
me
for
consideration
and
i
examined
it
very
carefully,
and
that
i
don't
think
that
it
is
within
the
corporate
power
of
the
city
of
chicago,
but
that
the
objective
could
be
obtained
in
some
other
way.
now
then
later
on
on
page
92,
the
questions
were
asked
by
some
of
the
older
men,
one
of
them
--
one
question
was,
“do
i
understand
that
terminal
vehicles
embrace
those
vehicles
that
operate
between
railroad
stations?”
the
chairman
said,
“yes.”
but
i
said,
“no,
it
is
not.”
the
operation
from
railroad
stations
to
points
within
the
central
business
district,
which
is
defined
as
the
area
bounded
on
the
north
by
ohio
street,
and
on
the
south
by
roosevelt
road,
and
the
lake
on
the
east,
and
canal
street
on
the
west,
is
in
the
railroad
terminal
area
but
it
isn't
necessarily
between
railroad
stations.
it
may
go
from
railroad
stations
to
hotels
and
from
hotels
to
railroad
stations.
that
is
the
operation
and
that
operation
can
be
continued
by
amendments
to
the
present
ordinance
without
conflicting
with
any
of
the
statutory
provisions.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
which
i
drafted
as
a
substitute
for
the
franchise
ordinance
was
an
annual
license
fee
to
permit
them
to
operate
as
a
local
transportation
facility
only.
and
that
operation
was
what
was
in
--
what
was
--
what
the
ordinance
that
was
drafted
as
a
substitute
for
the
franchise
ordinance
was
intended.
i
don't
know
whether
i
said
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
parmelee.
to
permit
them
to
operate
only
at
a
local
transportation
facility.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
same
as
taxicabs.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
not
necessarily
between
terminals
and
between
terminals
on
a
cash
basis.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
passenger
in
the
--
in
the
parmelee
vehicle
would
direct
the
parmelee
driver
where
he
wants
to
go.
he'd
pay
him
a
cash
fare.
if
he
wanted
to
go
to
another
station,
it
was
his
choice.
he
could
have
selected
a
parmelee
vehicle.
he
could
have
selected
--
he
could
have
selected
a
taxicab
or
a
street
car
or
any
other
available
vehicle
to
make
either
the
transfer
or
to
go
to
a
hotel
or
any
other
place
in
which
the
passenger
directed
him
to
go.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
he
used
--
they
--
if
there
was
a
coupon
prior
to
the
amendment
of
1955,
i
think
that
the
coupon
was
accepted
by
parmelee
either
to
transfer
him
to
a
station
or
transfer
him
to
a
hotel.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
after
the
new
ordinance,
he
had
no
such
things.
they
had
no
coupons.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
coupon
--
the
coupon
would
be
good
for
transfer?
yes.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
not
for
parmelee.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes,
that's
what
involved.
that's
what's
involved.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
i
do
not
say
that.
i
say
that
chicago
has
no
right
to
refuse
a
license
if
a
license
were
applied
or
if
they
are
subject
to
the
ordinance,
they
--
the
license
should
be
issued.
the
question
is,
are
they
subject
to
the
ordinance?
it's
a
question
of
the
construction
of
the
ordinance
and
not
--
there's
no
constitutional
question
involved.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no.
the
--
that
part
of
the
ordinance
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
is
strictly
applicable
to
a
local
transportation
facility.
it
cannot
be
applied
to
an
operation
which
is
exclusively
in
the
interstate
commerce
on
a
through
ticket.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
and
that
was
the
intention
of
that
--
of
that
provision.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
because
it's
the
--
it's
the
same
kind
of
a
provision
which
is
applicable
to
taxicabs
in
the
city
of
chicago.
and
when
this
court
said
that
in
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
yellow
cab
company,
when
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
parmelee
operation
was
subject
to
the
sherman
act
to
the
trust
--
antitrust
act
because
it
was
in
the
interstate
commerce,
but
the
yellow
cab
companies
were
not,
because
the
passengers
had
a
choice.
it
was
just
--
it
was
just
a
local
transportation.
in
the
same
case
in
that,
u.s.
against
yellow
cab
company,
when
the
ordinance
was
passed
to
make
parmelee
an
operator
the
same
as
the
yellow
cab
except
with
this
limitation
that
they
--
they
could
operate
only
within
the
central
business
district
whereas,
the
yellow
cab
company
could
operate
throughout
the
city
of
chicago.
the
--
it
was
--
it
became
necessary
to
limit
the
operations
by
this
provision
for
determining
whether
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
the
additional
service,
the
additional
local
service,
i
say,
or
whether
the
traffic
conditions
would
permit
additional
service
of
the
kind
and
character
applied
for.
and
i
say
that
that
28-31,
public
convenience
and
necessity
provision
is
applicable,
it
must
be
construed
--
it
must
be
construed
as
constitutional,
if
possible.
and
i
say
that
for
the
state
court
to
determine
--
the
state
court
should
determine
--
the
state
court
should
determine
whether
the
provision
limiting
the
number
of
vehicles
to
be
operated
in
interstation
service
should
--
is
applicable
in
the
light
of
any
constitutional
question
which
may
be
raised.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
certain
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
stated
it
more
clearly
than
i
probably
could.
that's
--
that's
the
entire
case.
i've
said
--
i've
--
i
tried
to
say
that
and
perhaps
i
was
--
i
haven't
been
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
as
clear
as
i
should
have
been.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
i
don't
think
that
it
goes
that
far,
yet.
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
is
right
that
the
facts
that
they
are
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
operation
is
partly
in
interstate
commerce.it
doesn't
follow
that
the
operation
is
not
subject
to
license
by
the
city.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it
doesn't
follow.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
this
is
purely
regulation.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
certainly.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes.
it
held
the
ordinance
for
it.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no.
it
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
correct.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes.
well
we
have
--
he
held
that
we
have
no
right
to
require
it
of
transfer
company.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
but
we
certainly
have
a
right
to
require
it
and
there
is
no
reason
why
that
section
should
have
been
held
void,
we
have
a
right
to
require
it
of
operators
like
parmelee
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
of
local
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
to
do
a
local
business.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
agree
that
the
ordinance
does
not
--
that
that
provision
of
the
ordinance,
that
section
of
the
ordinance
which
judge
schnackenberg
held
invalid
and
therefore
held
invalid
all
of
the
amendments
in
1955,
does
not
apply
to
transfer
operations.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
transfer
operations
are
still
--
may
still
be
subject
to
license.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
he
said
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
he
said
that,
but
he
said
that
it's
--
it's
subject
to
license
under
the
old
ordinance
and
he
nullified
the
1955
ordinance
because
of
the
--
of
the
provision,
because
of
the
provision
that
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
oh,
he
said
a
whole
lot
more
than
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
yes,
that's
what
he
cited.
the
question
--
and
i
say
that
the
--
that
the
constitutional
question
is
not
in
--
was
not
involved.
it
shouldn't
have
been
involved.
the
sole
question
here
and
the
--
and
this
respondent
submitted
the
question.
first,
that
the
ordinance
does
not
apply
--
that
the
1955
ordinance
does
not
apply
to
transfer.
they
contended
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
and
they
said
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
agree
with
it.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
and
from
there
--
from
there
i
say
that
--
that
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court,
the
court
of
appeals
in
striking
down
the
ordinance
of
1955,
because
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
provision
is
invalid
which
it
is
not,
as
applied
to
parmelee
or
applied
to
any
operator.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
say
that
it
is
--
it
wasn't
--
it
does
not
apply
to
transfer
and
that
therefore,
the
ordinance
should
not
have
been
held
invalid
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
and
there
should
have
been
no
constitutional
question
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
as
to
whether
that
--
as
to
whether
that
provision
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
applies
to
transfer
is
a
question,
i
think,
which
is
out
of
the
case.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
certainly
it
is.
transfer
is
a
party.
and
they
claimed
that
the
ordinance
doesn't
apply
to
them.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
district
court
said
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
personally
agree
with
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
city
of
chicago
takes
a
position
that
28
at
the
section
31-1
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
section
applies
to
all
local
operations
between
railroad
stations
and
any
destination
in
the
central
business
district
of
the
city.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
not
including
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
inclu
--
including
those
that
are
not
under
contract
for
interstation
transfer
including
those
who
do
not
travel
on
railroads
on
a
through
ticket.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
transfer
is
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
transfer
is
not
within
that
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
question
is
to
whether
transfer
should
be
licensed.
should
have
applied
for
a
license
and
the
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
1955
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
the
ordinance
before
you.
it
was
struck
down.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
other
ordinance,
say
--
this
wasn't
a
mandatory
ordinance,
the
other
ordinance
is
--
the
other
ordinance
is
applicable
if
this
ordinance
is
--
if
this
ordinance
is
invalid.
that
is
the
other
ordinance
still
has
provision
for
licensing
public
passenger
vehicles.
and
so,
does
the
1955
ordinance
have
provision
for
--
the
question
--
the
question
maybe
put
this
way.
it's
claimed
on
one
side
that
a
terminal
vehicle
is
--
that
the
definition
of
a
terminal
vehicle
doesn't
apply
to
transfer.
on
the
other
side,
in
the
case
--
parmelee,
who
was
an
intervener,
claims
that
terminal
--
the
definition
of
terminal
vehicle
is
broad
enough
to
include
transfer.
the
contest
was
between
these
two
companies.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
am
--
i
am
--
yes,
i'm
arguing
--
i'm
arguing
this
case.
i
say
that
so
far
as
public
convenience
and
necessity
are
concerned,
it
is
not
applicable.
this
provision
of
the
1955
ordinance
is
--
is
inapplicable
to
transfer.
but
i
say
that
the
question
of
whether
they
are
entitled
to
a
license,
whether
they
--
whether
the
ordinance
provides
for
the
licensing
of
transfer
vehicles,
is
one
for
the
state
courts
to
determine.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it
assumed
that
they
were
not
--
that
they
didn't
have
to
have
a
license.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it
isn't
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
lower
court
said
they
didn't
have
to
apply
for
a
license
because
the
1955
ordinance
was
void.
void
because
section
28-31.1
was
invalid
as
an
interference
with
interstate
commerce.
now,
i
say
that
28-31.1
is
not
invalid
because
it's
applicable
to
local
transportation
and
that
the
rest
of
the
ordinance
of
1955
is
valid
as
applied
to
transfer
and
as
applied
to
--
to
parmelee
if
it
is
the
terminal
vehicle.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
i
didn't
say
i
agree
with
that.
i
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
--
i
agree
that
the
provision
requiring
a
determination
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
does
not
apply
to
transfer.
that's
all
i
agreed
to.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
because
it
is
engaged
‘exclusively'
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that
is
the
ground
that
have
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it
didn't
find
it
invalid
merely
as
to
transfer
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i'm
--
it
didn't
--
it
--
it
found
the
whole
1955
ordinance
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
invalid.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
say
that
section
of
the
ordinance
doesn't
apply.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
but
the
--
i
--
i
say
there
is
--
they
may
still
be
required
to
secure
a
license
in
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no,
under
this
ordinance
because
this
ordinance
provides,
let
me
--
let
me
read
it
to
you.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it's
on
page
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
entire
ordinance.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
well,
i'll
read
it
from
my
--
from
my
note
because
i
have
it
here.
here
is
what
the
ordinance
--
the
amendatory
ordinance
was.
“be
it
ordained
by
the
city
council,
section
1.
section
28,
one
of
the
municipal
court
of
chicago
has
amended
by
striking
the
definition
of
terminal
vehicle
contained
therein
and
substituting
therefore
the
following
-
terminal
vehicle
means
a
public
passenger
vehicle
which
is
operated
exclusively
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
from
railroad
terminal
stations,
and
steamship
docks,
the
points
within
the
area
defined
in
section
28-31.
and
terminal
vehicle
shall
not
be
used
for
transportation
of
passengers
for
hire
except
from
railroad
terminal
stations
and
steamship
docks
to
destinations
in
the
central
business
area
of
the
city.”
now
then
comes
the
section
with
reference
to
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
the
section
relating
to
local
fares.
i
think
that
that's
--
i
had
it
a
moment
ago,
but
i
lost
the
40
--
i
think
it
is
42,
isn't
it?
yes.
it's
exhibit
b
on
page
44
of
the
transcript.
now,
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
which
are
not
amended
and
which
i
say
is
a
question
for
the
administrative
and
judicial
departments
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
determine,
is
that
that
section
which
remains
at
section
28-2,
“it
is
unlawful
for
any
person
other
than
a
metropolitan
transit
authority
or
public
utility
to
operate
any
vehicle
or
for
any
such
person
who
is
the
owner
of
any
vehicle
to
permit
it
to
be
operated
on
any
public
way
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
for
hire
from
place
to
place
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
except
on
a
funeral
trip,
unless
it
is
licensed
by
the
city
as
a
public
passenger
vehicle.”
now,
that
is
on
page
--
that's
in
the
record
on
page
173
which
i
read
yesterday,
page
173
of
the
record.
so
that
the
question
whether
they're
engaged
in
--
even
though
that
--
even
though
it's
in
the
interstate
commerce.
they
are
engaged
in
transporting
persons
between
stations,
between
two
points
within
the
city,
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city.
and
the
--
judge
schnackenberg
said
in
his
--
in
his
opinion
which
i
read
before
at
the
--
in
the
early
part
of
the
day.
that
the
city
has
a
right
to
license
the
operation
even
though
it
is
an
interstate
commerce.
and
it's
been
so
held
even
though
it's
an
interstate
commerce.
the
city
has
the
right
to
require
a
license
and
to
regulate
it
under
its
police
power.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
but
the
city
has
no
right
to
limit
or
to
deny
a
license
to
parmelee
simply
because
of
economic
--
the
economic
grounds,
that
is
limit
the
number
of
vehicles
to
those
that
are
necessary
for
the
service.
that's
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
provision.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it
doesn't
give
monopoly
power.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
it's
been
so
held
under
the
state
court
in
the
taxicab
cases.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
no.
judge
schnackenberg
said
that
it
was
invalid
because
there
was
an
interference
with
interstate
commerce.
but
it's
not
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
--
the
monopoly.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i'm
admitting
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
more
that
i
need
to
say
upon
this.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
may
i
have
a
few
minutes.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
don't
know
because
the
city
council,
of
course,
governed
--
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
the
city
council
governed
the
city.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
now
your
honor,
i'm
surprised
the
counsel
is
saying
that
he
is
subject
to
license
--
that
his
operation
is
subject
to
license
when
he
never
applied
for
a
license
and
he
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
they
are
not
subject
to
license,
which
he
didn't
read.
it
says
that
they
threatened
arrest
because
they
were
a
violator
of
the
ordinance
without
obtaining
terminal
vehicle
licenses
for
each
such
passenger
motor
vehicle
as
required
by
section
28-2
of
said
ordinance.
nowhere
does
it
appear
that
i
couldn't
issue
section
28-31.1.
all
we
did
and
when
he
talks
about
the
--
the
findings
of
fact
in
law,
i
was
merely
following
a
memorandum
of
judge
labuy,
the
district
court
i
was
compelled
to
find
the
way
he
found,
and
that
is
that
the
ordinance
was
applicable
to
it.
nothing
was
said
about
28-31.2
in
any
of
my
pleadings.
i
think
that
the
--
to
say
the
least,
improper
motives
were
attributed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
counsel
here
to
my
remarks
and
to
my
position.
i
never
took
the
position.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
contest
was
between
parmelee
and
transfer.
parmelee's
counsel
argued
the
case
before
the
district
court.
parmelee's
counsel
argued
the
case
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
and
the
controversy
between
--
between
the
two.
we
were
in
--
the
city
was
in
the
middle.
i
took
the
position
from
the
beginning
at
28-31.1
applied
to
terminal
vehicles
as
defined
and
that
is
the
new
definition
is
that
it's
a
local
transportation
facility.
and
i
never
--
i
never
deviated
from
that
from
the
beginning.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
certainly,
it
is.
and
--
and
counsel
here
--
counsel
here
said
that
they
are
subject
to
license
that
they
will
proceed
just
as
parmelee
did.
now,
why
didn't
they
do
it?
why
did
they
--
why
did
they
file
a
suit
to
restrain
the
city
from
enforcing
a
licensing
ordinance?
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
joseph
f.
grossman
i
saw
it.
i
saw
it,
your
honor.
that
was
a
civil
rights
case.
it
came
up
through
the
state
courts
by
virtue
of
a
conviction
for
violating
an
ordinance
to
that
or
a
state
statute
and
which
--
which
--
by
which
there
were
no
standards
fixed
or
the
issuance
of
a
license
as
i
recall
it.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
i
think
that
this
ought
to
go
to
the
state
courts
to
determine
whether
they
are
subject
to
license
although
they've
now
admitted
it.
they've
now
admitted
that
they're
subject
to
license.
and
that's
the
only
question
that
was
the
issue
in
the
case
whether
they
should
--
whether
they
should
apply
for
a
license
and
secure
a
license
to
operate.
now,
if
as
it's
contended,
they
couldn't
get
a
license
because
of
28-31.1,
then
it
would
be
their
prerogative
to
come
into
the
federal
courts
and
say
they
were
--
we
were
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
