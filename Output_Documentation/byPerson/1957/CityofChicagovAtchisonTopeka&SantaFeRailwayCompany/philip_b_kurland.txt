mr.
philip
b.
kurland
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
may
it
please
the
court.
i
currently
appear
here
in
the
role
of
the
devil's
advocate
after
what
both
parties
have
been
saying
about
parmelee.
the
appeal
in
petition
for
certiorari
in
number
104,
throw
out
of
the
judgment
which
was
rendered
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
our
position
is
very
different
from
the
cities
and
i
can
say
that
it
need
not
take
any
time
at
all
if
the
court's
position
is
that
there's
no
contest
between
the
--
between
parmelee
and
the
city.
i
would
merely
suggest
that
if
the
case
is
moot,
the
court
ought
to
vacate
the
judgments
below
and
for
the
reason
of
mootness.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well,
this
bring
the
--
one
of
the
questions
that
the
court
has
asked
us
to
appear
on.
the
problem
is
whether
parmelee
has
standing
to
maintain
its
position
in
this
court.
now,
if
your
honor's
question
goes
to
whether
the
statute
affects
parmelee
or
not
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
we
appear
not
against
the
city
but
on
the
side
of
the
city.
we
have
conceded
that
our
operations
which
include
both
interterminal
operations
and
transportation
of
passengers
from
the
terminals
to
other
points
within
the
area
defined
by
the
--
the
municipal
ordinance
are
subject
to
the
city's
licensing
power.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
we
appeared
--
we
intervened
as
a
party.
our
intervention
was
granted
as
permissive
intervention
although
we
sought
it
as
intervention
as
of
right.
we
contend
that
our
interest
as
a
competitor
of
transfer
would
be
adversely
affected
by
any
judgment
which
might
be
secured
by
transfer
in
this
action.
in
short,
our
position
is
that
we
have
standing
under
the
doctrine
of
the
frost
case.
please
the
court.
i
will
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
will
argue
it
if
the
court
preferred
to
argue
it.
if
the
court
prefers
--
prefers
to
leave
it
to
the
brief,
i
will
be
glad
to
do
so.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no,
i
think
the
frost
case
does
control
it.
there
is
one
other
question
about
the
appealability
of
this
case
and
this
is
a
question
whether
an
appeal
rely
under
section
1254
(2)
from
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
appeals
holding
a
state
statute
unconstitutional.
that
is
whether
this
is
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
the
appeal.
my
position
maybe
stated
fairly
shortly.
we
contend
first
that
1254
(2)
ought
not
to
and
it
was
not
intended
to
impose
a
final
judgment
requirement.
this
court
has
held,
i
will
concede,
on
two
points
that
a
final
judgment
requirement
is
in
the
statute.
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
the
court
did
so
without
the
benefit
of
argument
of
counsel.
if
it
so,
first
in
the
slaker
case,
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
the
1925
judiciary
act.
and
again,
in
the
south
carolina
electric
and
gas
company
case
relying
on
the
slaker
case,
that
the
slaker
case
statement
of
a
requirement
for
finality
was
a
dictum
because
as
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
said
in
rendering
the
opinion
for
the
court,
the
petition
--
the
petition
in
the
court
below
contained
three
counts,
none
of
which
questioned
the
validity
of
a
state
statute.
he
then
went
on
to
state
in
his
opinion
that
the
appeal
must
be
one
from
a
final
judgment.
but
again
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
he
relied
on
two
cases.
the
first
of
which
was
an
appeal
from
the
philippines
supreme
court
in
which
the
statute
specifically
made
a
requirement
of
finality.
now,
the
second
was
collins
against
miller
which
was
a
direct
appeal
from
the
--
from
a
district
court
of
united
states
with
the
statute
also
that
made
a
specific
requirement
of
finality.
now,
the
statute
in
question
was
adopted
on
the
--
it
was
--
the
section
question
was
inserted
in
the
florida
senate
when
the
1925
act
was
there.
it
was
adopted
from
the
provision
authorizing
appeal
to
this
court
from
state
courts
holding
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional.
that
provision
specifically
made
a
requirement
of
finality.despite
that,
the
--
and
with
this
in
front
of
them,
the
congress
adopted
all
the
--
adopted
all
the
remainder
of
the
language
but
did
not
include
within
this
statute
any
specifications
of
finality.
there
is
so
far
as
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
concerned
as
you
know
no
other
provision
in
this
--
in
the
code
which
requires
a
final
judgment
in
terms
of
the
court
--
review
of
the
courts
of
appeals
whether
that
review
is
by
way
of
appeal
or
by
way
of
certiorari.
we
suggest
that
there
may
be
a
good
reason
for
that
distinction
and
one
of
those
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
get
jurisdiction
in
the
case
until
a
final
judgment
has
been
entered
by
a
district
court.
i
would
submit
that
the
type
of
question
which
is
brought
up
under
1254
(2)
is
one
of
great
importance.
it
involves
the
relationships
of
the
state
and
federal
government
and
will
not
present
an
issue
to
the
court
until
a
united
states
court
of
appeals
has
first
held
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
that
the
reason
behind
this
statute
is
the
same
as
the
reason
behind
the
statute
authorizing
this
court
to
take
jurisdiction
by
direct
appeal
in
cases
where
the
federal
government,
a
statute
of
federal
government
is
held
unconstitutional
in
the
court
of
appeals
plus
the
additional
factor
with
delicacy
of
the
relationships
between
the
two
jurisdictions.
and
i
would
suggest
that
reading
the
intent
of
congress,
reading
the
purpose
behind
the
act
and
recognizing
that
this
case
is
a
comparatively
few
in
number
so
that
they
will
not
likely
to
be
a
burden
to
the
court
or
that
if
they
were,
the
court
could
dispose
them
as
they
did
in
slaker
in
the
event
of
a
frivolous
appeal
by
assessing
a
penalty
or
by
the
usual
method
which
it
has
adopted
from
time
to
time
and
that
is
by
dismissing
or
rather
in
this
event
affirming
per
curiam.
i
would
like
to
suggest
in
a
minute
or
two
that
remains
that
even
if
the
--
your
final
judgment
requirement
is
in
section
1254
(2)
of
the
statute,
we
meet
that
final
judgment
requirement
in
this
case.
the
court
has
stated
a
test
whether
a
judgment
is
final
is
whether
the
--
the
judgment
below
had
terminated
the
litigation.
so,
if
this
court
were
to
affirm,
nothing
more
it
needs
to
be
done
on
the
remand
and
that's
exactly
the
situation
that
this
court
finds
that
this
case
is
in
both
parties
have
agreed.
both
parties
to
this
litigation
that
this
judgment
disposes
of
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
disposes
all
the
issues
between
the
parties
that
on
remand,
nothing
would
be
left
to
be
done
in
the
event
of
affirmance
or
indeed
in
the
event
of
a
reversal,
except
to
enter
the
judgment
of
the
court.
that
being
so,
we
submit
that
we
meet
the
test
which
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
suggested
as
stating
the
requirement
of
finality.
if
i
may
then
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
contested
issues
in
the
case
or
perhaps
before
i
get
to
the
contested
issues,
i
should
say
that
the
--
there
are
certain
concessions
of
both
parties
in
this
lawsuit
which
eliminate
contest.
the
--
should
i
stop
at
this
point,
your
honor
or
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
the
appellant
has
conceded
that
the
city
of
chicago
has
no
power
to
impose
economic
regulations
on
the
carrier
--
carriage
in
question
that
as
we
do
not
claim
for
the
city
of
chicago,
the
authority
to
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
additional
competition
is
or
is
not
desirable.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i'd
better
clarify
our
position
that
parmelee
stands
in,
particularly
with
relation
to
section
28-31.1
of
the
municipal
code.
mr.
grossman
apparently
contended
that
the
statute
--
the
ordinance
was
valid
but
not
applicable.
the
appellants
here
appear
to
have
contended
that
it
was
applicable
but
invalid.
and
it's
our
position
that
it's
both
valid
and
applicable.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that
this
ordinance
--
section
28-31.1
is
both
applicable
and
valid
and
applicable
to
transfer
as
we
have
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
it's
applicable
for
parmelee.
the
parmelee
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
we
have
never
raised
any
question
as
--
so
far
as
parmelee
is
concerned.
we
do
not
do
so
here
and
this
would
not
be
the
proper
litigation
to
do
so.
our
position
is
that
we
have
aligned
ourselves
with
the
city
in
defending
the
application
and
validity
of
these
arguments.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
it's
true
that
--
that
parmelee
does
have
vehicle
licenses
at
the
moment.
the
renewal
provision
is
not
peculiar
to
this
portion
of
the
statute.
it's
applicable
both
to
the
delivery
and
the
taxicab
provisions
but
it's
merely
a
form
for
administering
a
--
a
statute
to
this
point.
it
would
be
unfortunate
and
impractical
to
require
carriers
who
have
applied
for
and
secured
a
license
to
come
back
year
after
year
to
renew
their
applications.
and
if
terminal
should
apply
for
license
and
secure
it,
it
will
no
longer
have
to
apply
for
a
license
thereafter
so
long
as
it
continues
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no,
because
they
are
taking
out
another
license
under
the
same
ordinance.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no,
this
--
this
ordinance
will
be
applicable
only
to
terminal
vehicles
which
are
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
--
on
the
terms
of
the
statute
vehicles
which
pick
up
passengers
at
stations
and
deliver
them
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
--
within
the
central
area.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that
parmelee
had
all
the
licenses
outstanding
at
the
time
of
the
passengers
are
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well,
the
statute
--
the
ordinance
at
the
time
specified
that
a
terminal
vehicle
was
a
vehicle
operated
by
a
person
who
had
a
contract
with
the
railroad.
it's
the
railroad
that
gives
the
exclusive
contract
and
not
the
city.
the
railroad
had
granted
an
exclusive
contract
to
parmelee.
after
the
end
of
the
parmelee
contract,
when
the
railroads
decided
to
hire
another
carrier,
the
crew
in
--
in
response
to
a
question
mr.
justice
harlan
said
earlier
today,
the
city
--
the
city
was
asked
to
broaden
the
definition
of
terminal
vehicles
so
that
parmelee
could
continue
to
operate.
under
the
28-31.1,
parmelee
is
now
required
to
have
a
license
and
can
continue
to
have
a
license.
a
terminal
can
also
apply
for
a
license
and
we
submit
and
can
secure
one
if
they
meet
the
conditions
which
the
city
imposes.
there
is
no
monopoly
situation
involved
here
with
the
court.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
certainly
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
certainly
could
subject
to
cost
to
the
lawsuit
they
might
in
fact
be
terminal.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
sir.
their
power
under
the
statute
certainly
exists
for
them
to
retain
another
service.
let
me
point
it
out
that
the
service
which
terminal
is
supplying
is
not
an
agency
service
as
it's
been
suggested.
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
between
terminals
and
the
railroads,
terminal
is
acting
as
an
independent
contractor.
they're
required
to
act
as
an
independent
contractor.
on
page
40,
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
section
11
after
the
contract,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
the
transfer
shall
be
and
remain
an
independent
contractor.
and
if
you
will
look
at
the
top
of
that
page,
you
will
find
another
provision
of
the
contract
which
indicated
quite
clearly
that
it
was
a
contemplation
of
the
parties
that
this
transfer
service
would
submit
itself
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
government
agencies
having
jurisdiction
over
it.
at
the
top
of
the
page
in
(l)
of
paragraph
10
of
the
contract
between
the
railroads
and
terminals
--
i'm
sorry,
in
transfer,
if
the
agreement
provides
that
transfer
shall
comply
at
all
times
with
all
laws,
rules
and
regulations
of
governmental
agencies
having
jurisdiction
over
it.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
are
not,
sir.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
are
in
the
record
with
the
--
at
page
195
of
the
record.
you
will
find
the
tariff.
it
starts
on
page
193.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
exactly,
sir.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
this
is
a
choice
of
the
railroads.
the
position
that
we
maintain
here
is
that
unless
and
until
transfer
shall
have
applied
for
a
license
and
have
had
it
refused
on
improper
grounds,
they
lack
the
standing
to
complain
about
the
action
of
the
city
of
chicago.
it
has
been
their
choice
to
avoid
making
use
of
the
administrator
of
remedies
that
are
available
to
them.
we
concede
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
so
the
question
is
whether
there's
an
unconstitutional
requirement
on
this
phase,
your
honor.
and
they
take
the
position
of
this
because
the
statute
contains
--
the
ordinance
contains
the
words
"convenience
and
necessity"
or
"certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity."
it's
quite
clear
from
both
decisions
of
this
court
and
decisions
of
the
illinois
court
that
that
phrase
is
not
a
phrase
at
all.
it
is
not
restricted
to
the
application
of
economic
considerations.
we
concede
that
if
it
were,
the
city
could
not
exercise
its
power
over
the
--
the
transport
company.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
the
cases
which
have
been
before
this
court,
the
court
has
recognized
and
permitted
states
to
regulate
the
carriers,
motor
carriers
over
the
highways
of
the
state
under
a
requirement
that
they
obtain
a
“certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity”.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
make
reference
to
the
case
of
columbia
terminals
company
against
lambert
which
is
exactly
an
off-course
with
this
particular
case.
in
both
cases,
we
had
interstate
commerce
involved.
in
both
cases,
the
interstate
commerce
involved
was
a
transfer
between
railroad
terminals.
in
both
cases,
the
state
required
that
the
carrier
apply
for
a
license
in
order
to
engage
in
the
service.
in
both
cases,
the
state
--
the
carrier
refused
to
apply
for
that
license.
in
both
cases,
the
counsel
for
the
state
asserted
that
the
state
was
without
power
to
apply
these
economic
tests,
those
tests
which
were
rejected
in
buck
against
kuykendall.
the
state
was
without
power
to
apply
those
tests
to
an
interstate
motor
carrier.
now,
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
the
carrier
was
not
eligible
to
complain
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
until
such
time
as
they
had
first
applied
for
a
license
and
had
it
refused
on
improper
grounds.
perhaps,
i
should
also
make
reference
to
the
case
of
bradley
against
public
utilities
commission
of
ohio.
i
do
so
because
the
buck
and
kuykendall
case
as
you
may
recall
is
written
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
so
to
as
the
bradley
against
public
utilities
case.
the
public
utilities
case
came
after
the
buck
and
kuykendall
case.
in
that
case,
in
the
bradley
case,
the
court
was
asked
to
decide
whether
a
state
could
impose
a
requirement
for
securing
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
an
interstate
motor
carrier.
the
court
held
that
it
could
do
so,
so
long
as
the
grounds
which
--
on
which
it
was
applying
that
statute
were
grounds
relevant
to
the
police
power
and
the
power
to
control
the
highways.
we
submit
that
that's
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
situation.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
as
i
have
said
in
the
yellow
cab
company
against
city
of
chicago
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
do
i
think
they're
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
think
they
are
not,
sir.
i
think
that
they
are
both
the
--
the
first
set
or
more
specific
that
this
has
given
some
discretion
in
the
exercise
of
the
granting
of
the
license
in
terms
of
the
police
power.
and
if
i
may
revert
to
the
bradley
case
and
i
must
use
a
hypothetical
because
in
the
absence
of
the
application
for
a
license,
i
don't
know,
nobody
knows
what
the
position
the
license
commissioner
would
take
on
this.
but
suppose
that
the
application
for
the
license
were
denied
or
were
granted
on
condition
as
it
--
as
it
could
be
granted
under
this
provision
on
condition
that
the
terminal
vehicles
not
use
certain
streets
during
the
rush
hour
in
the
chicago
loop
that
they
reroute
their
vehicles
during
that
period.
nowhere
else
in
the
ordinance
would
that
probably
be
available
to
the
--
to
the
city.
i
submit
that
it
is
available
under
28-31.1.
in
short,
my
suggestion
is
the
fact
that
the
city
has
attempted
to
impose
police
power
regulations
on
what
is
admittedly
interstate
commerce
does
not
invalidate
the
statute.
and
until
such
time
as
the
application
has
been
made
to
the
city,
we
do
not
know
that
the
license
will
be
denied.
we
do
not
know
that
if
it's
denied,
it
will
be
denied
on
the
improper
grounds.
and
so
we
pull
in
a
long
line
of
cases
not
the
--
perhaps
the
most
recent
statement
of
this
court
on
the
subject
based
on
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california
against
united
states
handed
down
on
monday
in
which
the
court
said
"if
an
administrative
proceeding
might
leave
no
room
until
the
constitutional
question,
the
administrator
for
parmelee
plainly
should
be
pursued."
and
that's
all
that
we
suggest
should
be
done
here
until
such
time
as
it
is
preserved.
this
fraud
is
faced
with
a
hypothetical
question.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
the
--
the
proposition
there
goes
back
to
the
--
the
court
took
the
position
that
the
statute
was
invalid
on
its
face
just
as
it
did
in
the
georgia
case
to
which
justice
whittaker
referred
earlier
today.
the
only
basis
for
saying
that
this
statute
is
invalid
on
its
face
is
by
construing
convenience
and
necessity
to
allow
the
city
to
impose
invalid
economic
requirements,
requirements
which
would
be
invalid
under
the
buck
and
kuykendall
test.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
your
honor,
you
--
you
say
it's
a
political
decision
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
would
be
with
the
city
council
as
a
body
which
has
administrative
functions
as
well
as
legislative
functions
in
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
i
don't
know
if
this
court
has
ever
suggested
that
the
administrative
procedure,
the
form
of
the
administrative
procedure
should
take
within
a
jurisdiction
shall
be
governed
by
the
--
the
determination
of
this
court.
again,
we
cannot
tell
how
formal
or
informal
the
requirement
of
going
before
the
city
council
is
going
to
be
until
such
time
as
the
application
has
been
made.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no,
there
was
not,
sir.
they
had
a
public
utility
commission.
but
i
think
that
the
position
was
quite
specifically.
the
analogy
was
well
drawn
this
morning
when
the
suggestion
was
made
that
the
commissioner
is
acting
as
an
examiner,
a
finder
of
fact
to
make
the
determination
and
recommend
action
by
the
city
council.
now
clearly,
if
we
had
--
if
the
city
council
were
to
put
on
a
different
set
of
hats
and
designate
itself
to
public
utility
commission
for
the
city
of
chicago,
we
would
have
a
similar
situation
to
the
bradley
case.
it's
the
fact
that
they
happen
to
have
in
addition
to
their
legislative
capacities.
they
have
undertaken
an
administrative
function.
i
do
not
see
how
that
sanction
of
function
by
the
city
council
makes
for
a
basis
for
distinguishing
the
bradley
case.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
no,
this
--
this
would
go
to
a
separate
issue.
the
point
that
i've
been
talking
to
is
the
power
of
the
city
to
--
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well,
yes.
now,
we
are
now
--
in
the
suggestion
that
you
raised
goes
to
the
question
of
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
if
there
is
any
and
it's
our
position
that
there
is
no
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
the
federal
statute
was
interpreted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
itself
with
regard
to
the
very
tight
--
with
the
very
activity
that's
under
question
in
this
case.
in
--
in
the
case
of
status
of
parmelee,
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
statute
which
has
been
referred
to.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
and
on
status
of
--
it's
on
page
39
of
our
brief.
it
starts
on
38.
the
quotation
is
found
at
38
and
39.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
initiated
a
proceeding
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
certain
action
should
--
whether
any
action
should
be
taken
for
purposes
of
issuing
orders
with
reference
to
parmelee.
parmelee
was
then
engaged
in
the
service
of
transferring
passengers
from
one
terminal
to
another
under
contract
with
the
railroads
exactly
as
--
as
transfer
is
doing
now.
the
court
held
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
held,
first,
that
they
were
not
motor
carriers
for
purposes
of
part
2
of
the
act
and
we're
not
subject
to
regulation
there.
they
held
that
under
part
1
of
the
act,
they
were
subject
to
regulation
although
they
were
not
carriers
under
part
1
of
the
act.
the
court
--
the
commission
specifically
makes
the
statement.
they
are
not
a
carrier
but
they
are
subject
to
regulation
under
the
act.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
never
issued
any
regulation
or
attempted
to
assert
any
power
over
this
type
of
activity.
it's
an
activity
which
again
as
i've
stated
in
the
status
of
parmelee,
the
railroads
can
adopt
or
reject
at
their
will.
but
as
in
--
in
many
cities,
they
do
have
this
transfer
service.
in
many
cities,
they
do
not
have
this
transfer
service.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
the
statute
does
not
say
that.it
says
that
they
--
that
they
have
the
power
to
engage
in
this
activity.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
and
they
can
engage
in
this
activity.
but
the
congress
has
not
suggests
that
the
agents
which
they
choose
need
not
to
comply
with
the
police
regulations
of
the
states.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well,
let
me
--
let
me,
if
i
may,
sir,
point
out
that
the
--
the
very
--
the
railroads
themselves
in
this
case
are
taking
the
position
that
the
other
provisions
of
this
ordinance
are
applicable
to
transfer
that
they
do
have
to
apply
for
a
license,
that
they
do
have
to
meet
the
safety
requirements
which
is
specifically
set
forth
in
those
parts
of
the
ordinance
prior
to
section
28-31.1
and
that
they're
to
subject
suspension
if
they
do
not
comply
with
those
regulations.
now,
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
indicated
that
it
is
true
not
with
regards
to
the
specific
activity
but
with
reference
to
activities
of
motor
carriers
within
a
municipal
area.
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
itself
has
rules
as
to
require
the
submission
of
these
local
carriers
operating
within
this
area
to
local
police
regulations.
they
make
certain
exceptions
which
are
not
pertinent
here
except
the
carriers
of
explosives
for
the
reason
which
i
do
not
think
of
is
relevant.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
no
indication
either
in
the
statute
and
there
is
certainly
has
no
indication
by
the
way
the
commission
has
acted
that
the
federal
government
either
has
undertaken,
is
prepared
to
undertake
the
things
it
was
to
undertake
this
type
of
municipal
activity
within
a
single
municipal
area.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
the
congress
has
not
said
that
they
must
function
or
can't
function
by
choosing
a
--
a
transfer
service
which
would
be
operating
in
violation
of
the
law.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
castle
against
hayes
freight
company.
we
are
conceded
in
our
brief
and
we
concede
constantly
throughout
this
litigation
that
the
federal
or
government
if
it
had
issued
a
license
or
if
the
federal
regulations
came
into
conflict
with
the
regulations
of
this
ordinance
then
it
would
be
quite
clear
and
nobody
challenges
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
government
in
this
area.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
it
does
not
allow
them
to
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
it
does
not
give
the
equivalent
of
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
which
did
exist
in
the
hayes
case.
what
we
would
have
would
be
if
we
were
to
analogize
this
to
the
hayes
case,
hayes
to
retain
an
independent
contractor
to
carry
on
some
of
its
business
and
then
tell
the
state
of
illinois
that
it
has
no
power
over
this
independent
contractor
for
the
reason
that
hayes
--
not
the
independent
contractor
but
hayes
has
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
have
no
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
your
honor,
we
would
--
have
no
question
about
that.
there's
no
language
--
nothing
in
the
statute
indicated
what
congress
did.
and
certainly,
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
indicate
that
the
federal
government
just
kept
a
hands-off
policy
over
this
type
of
operation.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
think
they
could
exercise
--
issue
regulations
governing
the
--
the
operation
of
this
part
of
interstate
commerce
the
same
as
they
have
with
regard
and
as
the
respondent's
brief
show,
with
regard
to
some
of
the
trucking
operations
that
are
combined
with
(voice
overlap)
operation.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
could
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
could
deal
with
safety
with
the
employee
--
with
the
hiring
of
employees,
with
the
--
they
--
they
could
cover
all
of
the
area
but
they
have
--
they
had
not
said
so
and
if
--
if
you're
asking
what
they
said
in
the
parmelee
case
this
is
what
my
interpretation
of
the
parmelee
case.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
it
was
sought
to
bring
the
parmelee's
operations
under
the
active
regulation
of
the
--
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
when
you
say
sought
to
be
done,
i
--
i
can't
answer
that.
they
initiated
this
proceeding
themselves.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
to
determine
whether
a
certain
regulation
should
be
issued
by
the
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well,
your
honor,
you're
asking
me
for
motives
which
i
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
well
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
would
suggest
that
power
is
playing
around
the
situation.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
they
have
chosen
not
to
exercise
it.
they
have
chosen
not
to
exercise
any
of
the
power
which
they
have
over
this
type
of
operation.
they
found
that
it
removed
from
this
part
2
of
the
act.
they
established
their
power.
they
assert
their
power
over
this
operation
as
a
railroad
operation
but
they
deny
that
this
is
a
carrier
which
i
take
it
means
that
the
commerce
commission
has
the
same
power
over
this
operation
as
they
would
have
over
railroad
operations,
any
other
form
of
railroad
operation.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
if
they
chose
to
exercise
it.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
tariff
which
would
prevent
them
from
engaging
free
such
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
that's
right.
let
me
suggest
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
i
should
think
that
it
could,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
exactly.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
yes,
it
is.
and
so
in
--
in
brief,
our
position
is
that
we
do
not
have
an
attempt
to
exercise
economic
control
over
the
interstate
commerce
involved
in
this
case
nor
do
we
have
any
conflict
between
the
city's
ordinance.
i'm
talking
both
cases
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance.
we
do
not
have
any
conflict
between
the
ordinance
and
any
federal
regulation.
that
being
so,
this
court
cannot
be
ask
to
make
a
decision
as
to
what
the
city's
powers
are
until
they've
been
invoked.
they
have
not
been
invoked
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
railroads
and
the
transport
service
are
in
no
position
at
this
time
to
ask
this
court
to
pass
on
what
is
a
hypothetical
question.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
but
in
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
if
the
court
has
a
question
--
mr.
philip
b.
kurland
--
give
you
back
the
rest
of
the
time.
thank
you
very
much.
