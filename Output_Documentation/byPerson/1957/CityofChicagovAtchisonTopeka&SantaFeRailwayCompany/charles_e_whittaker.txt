justice
charles
e.
whittaker
parmelee
did
both
a
transportation
of
--
of
passengers
between
terminals
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
as
a
local
business
to
hotels.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
amendment
really
consists
of
the
elimination
of
the
phrase
“having
a
contract
with
the
railroad”.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
grossman,
may
i
ask
you,
please?
are
we
here
concerned
now
with
what
parmelee
may
do?
are
we
not
now
concerned
with
what
transfer
may
do?
isn't
that
what's
involved
in
this
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
--
you
contend,
as
i
understand
now,
maybe
i
do
not
correctly
understand,
that
chicago
has
the
right
to
refuse
a
license
to
transfer
to
conduct
as
a
carrier
between
these
terminals
interstate
commerce.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
assume
that
they
are
subject
to
the
ordinance,
then,
does
not
the
ordinance
say
that
before
the
license
can
be
issued,
chicago
must
find
public
convenience
and
necessity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
all
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
grossman,
may
i
bother
you
once
more,
please?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
chicago
couldn't
require
a
license
from
transfer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
held
that
void
only
in
that
it
--
you
could
not
require
it
to
apply
for
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
did
--
didn't
judge
schnackenberg
say
that
chicago
still
had
the
right
under
its
police
powers
to
require
a
license?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he's
merely
held,
did
he
not,
as
i
understood
the
opinion,
that
you
have
no
right
to
require
the
transfer
company
to
apply
for
--
and
go
through
the
proceedings
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
which
they
probably
couldn't
get.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
do
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
do
a
local
business.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
what
about
requiring
it
or
denying
it
to
one
who
is
engaged
exclusively
in
commerce?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
will
isn't
on
this
(voice
overlap)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
didn't
he
say
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
chicago
had
no
right
to
require
them
to
obtain
a
certificate
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
of
convenience
and
necessity
which
they
couldn't
get.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
all
he
said?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
he
decided,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
about
as
applied
to
transfer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
transfer
here
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
including
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
transfer.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
court
of
appeals
held
substantially
--
well,
they
held
that
section
28-31.1
could
not
be
enforced
against
transfer.
now,
they
didn't
invalidate
that
provision
as
far
as
parmelee
was
concerned.
they
merely
held
that
28-31.1
could
not
be
enforced
against
transfer.
that's
all
they
held.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
think
it
was?
