mr.
amos
m.
mathews
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
if
i
may
to
make
a
complete
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
however,
because
the
subject
has
been
a
matter
of
colloquy
for
the
past
15
or
20
minutes,
i
want
to
correct
one
thing.
of
course,
i
do
not
know
the
extent
to
which
mr.
grossman
is
now
authorized
to
speak
for
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago.
but
in
both
courts
below,
the
city
of
chicago
and
mr.
grossman
by
signed
pleadings
and
representations
of
attorneys
and
counselors
of
the
court,
took
the
firm
position
that
the
1955
public
convenience
and
necessity
provision
of
the
ordinance
was
applicable
to
the
transfer
operation
being
carried
on
under
the
contract
between
transfer
and
the
railroads.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
practical
effect
--
well,
the
--
you
have
to
go
a
little
bit
farther
than
that.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i
just
as
well
--
just
as
well
take
that
up
at
this
time.
under
the
amendment
of
1955,
transfer
cannot
operate
any
vehicle
in
the
city
of
chicago
unless,
first,
it
applies
to
the
commissioner
of
public
vehicles.
and
the
commissioner
after
a
hearing
determines
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
the
vehicles
and
then
--
and
here's
the
thing
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
our
adversaries
don't
say
anything
about,
after
the
commissioner
has
made
a
finding,
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago
must
pass
an
ordinance
authorizing
transfer
to
operate
any
vehicle.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
case
merely
of
application
to
an
administrate
for
an
administrative
finding
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
or
whatever
else
you
want
to
call
it.
the
administrator
in
effect,
if
we
may
borrow
a
terminology
from
the
regulatory
commissions,
the
administrator
is
made
an
examiner,
say
to
use
the
terminology
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
he
makes
a
recommendation,
but
the
recommendation
is
worth
nothing
unless
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago
passes
an
ordinance.
now,
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago,
if
a
subject
is
within
its
ordaining
powers
has
power
to
--
thank
you
--
has
power
to
pass
an
ordinance
or
to
refrain
from
passing
an
ordinance.
so
under
the
1955
amendment,
which
mr.
grossman
himself
by
signed
pleadings
in
the
courts
below
in
the
city
of
chicago
by
its
corporation
council,
by
signed
pleadings
in
the
courts
below,
has
insisted
stoutly
applies
to
the
transfer
operation
here
involved,
we
could
not
operate
unless
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago
authorizes
to
do
so
by
ordinance.
now,
for
example,
devoting
a
little
more
time
to
this
point
than
i
thought
i
would
at
the
beginning,
but
i
--
i
--
it's
--
i
can
see
its
importance,
of
course.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
think
i
will
proceed
to
that
right
now.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i
--
i
merely
--
i
merely
adverted
to
these
other
things
because
they
were
so
surprising
to
me.
very
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
i
shall
proceed
along
that
line.
the
21
railroads
having
passenger
--
operating
passenger
trains
into
chicago
and
a
corporation
known
as
railroad
transfer
service,
incorporated
started
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
chicago
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
is
inapplicable
to
them
or
if
applicable,
is
violative
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
--
in
the
district
court
there,
upon
representations
of
the
city
of
chicago,
mr.
grossman
prepared
a
conclusion
of
law
for
the
district
court,
that
the
conclusion
of
law
been
to
the
effect
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
provision
applies
to
the
transfer
operation.
the
district
court
held
the
ordinance
applicable
in
all
respects
to
transfer
and
held
it
valid.
the
railroads
and
transfer
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
railroads
are
operating
the
interstation
transfer
service
under
section
202
(c)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
setout
in
full
on
pages
30
to
31
of
our
brief.
i
will
go
back
to
that
act
more
in
detail
after
i've
stated
the
general
background.but
the
district
court
--
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
--
that
one
section
of
the
chicago
ordinance
obstructed
the
interstate
commerce
being
conducted
by
the
railroads
between
the
terminal
stations
under
the
authority
of
section
202
(c)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
court
of
appeals
held
every
other
section
of
the
ordinance
valid
and
applicable
to
the
transfer
operation,
and
the
railroads
and
transfer
did
not
appeal
from
any
part
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
that
is
what
happened
in
the
district
court
and
that
in
very
brief
capsule
--
i
mean,
in
both
courts
below
and
that
in
very
brief
capsule
is
--
was
the
court
proceeding.
now,
i
go
back
to
the
factual
background
but
i
will
return,
if
time
permits
and
i'm
sure
it
will,
to
a
comparison
of
the
ordinance
--
the
conflicting
ordinance
and
the
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
which
i
refer.
for
many
years,
the
21
railroads
operating
passenger
trains
in
chicago
have
provided
by
tariffs
filed
with
both
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
illinois
commerce
commission
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
between
chicago
stations;
that
is
of
passengers
travelling
on
through
tickets.
there
are
eight
passenger
terminals
in
downtown
chicago
served
by
the
21
railroads.
each
terminals
serves
from
one
to
six
railroads.
some
through
passengers
--
well,
no
railroad,
as
you
no
doubt
know,
passes
through
chicago
but
several
thousand
passengers
per
day
travel
on
through
railroad
tickets
through
chicago,
that
is
from
a
point
of
origin
outside
chicago
on
beyond
the
point
of
origin.
the
passenger
buys
at
his
point
of
origin
a
railroad
ticket
consisting
of
a
series
of
coupons,
good
for
each
railroad
on
which
he
operates
to
destination.
if
the
passenger
in
chicago
must
transfer
from
an
incoming
railroad
--
from
the
station
of
an
incoming
railroad
to
another
station
of
the
outgoing
railroad,
that
is
if
they're
not
in
the
same
station,
that
through
ticket
has
a
coupon.
the
passenger
arrives
in
chicago
and
he
hands
that
coupon
to
a
representative
of
the
transfer
agency
of
the
railroads
and
he
and
his
baggage
are
carried
to
the
outgoing
railroad,
where
the
price
of
the
whole
ticket
is
more
than
a
very
small
minimum,
it
varies
--
no
--
no
need
to
state
that,
but
substantially
--
in
the
case
of
substantially
all
tickets,
that
extra
coupon
does
not
add
--
there's
no
charge
for
it
at
all
over
the
regular
tariff
fare
for
the
passenger
ticket.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
--
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
fair
to
say,
except
this,
and
i
want
to
make
this
point
plain.
where
the
passenger
does
not
have
to
change
stations,
where,
for
instance,
he
arrives
in
the
union
station
and
goes
out
of
the
union
station,
his
ticket
is
the
same
price
as
the
passenger
who
has
transfer.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
right.
now,
the
transfer
agent
obtains
his
pay
or
his
compensation
for
performing
this
service
from
the
outgoing
railroad.
that
is
the
transfer
agent
collects
these
coupons
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
or
whatever
the
time
is
agreed
upon,
he
sends
a
statement
for
all
of
the
transfer
coupons
he's
collected
to
the
outgoing
railroad
and
he's
paid
by
them.
now,
i
want
to
call
your
attention,
something
that
is
i
think
of
greatest
importance
at
this
point.
this
transfer
operation
through
passengers
--
oh,
i
should
give
you
a
few
statistics,
i
think.
approximately
3900
passengers
per
day
on
the
average
transfer
in
chicago
by
means
of
this
transfer
service.
that
is
from
an
incoming
station
to
an
outgoing
station.
and
more
than
99%
of
this
3900
are
travelling
between
destinations
located
in
different
states.
and
in
the
yellow
cab
case
in
322
u.s.,
this
court
specifically
held
that
that
particular
operation
is
interstate
commerce.
that
is
the
transfer
over
the
chicago
streets
of
a
traveler
travelling
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
this
interstation
transfer
of
passengers
under
the
contract
between
transfer
and
the
railroads
and
under
the
former
arrangement
between
parmelee
and
the
railroads
is
squarely
within
the
authorization
of
section
202
(c)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
as
i
said,
that
section
is
setout
in
full
on
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief,
by
paragraph
(1)
of
section
202
(c),
transportation
by
motor
vehicle,
by
carriers,
by
railroad,
or
water,
or
freight
forwarders,
when
performed
within
the
terminal
areas
of
those
carriers
for
transfer,
collection,
or
delivery
service
are
exempt
from
part
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
regulating
motor
carriers,
but
are
made
railroad
transportation
subject
to
part
1.
that
--
this
section
202
(c)
was
enacted
in
1940,
an
amendment
in
1942
has
nothing
material
to
this
controversy.
however,
subparagraph
(2)
of
section
202
(c)
provides
this,
and
i'm
reading
a
few
lines
from
the
quote
at
page
31
of
my
brief,
“transportation
by
motor
vehicle
by
any
person
whether
as
agent
or
under
a
contractual
arrangement
for
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
subject
to
part
1.
in
the
performance
within
terminal
areas,
the
transfer,
collection,
or
delivery
service
shall
be
considered
to
be
performed
by
such
carrier,”
now
that
means
carrier
by
railroad,
“as
part
of
and
shall
be
regulated
in
the
same
manner
as
the
transportation
by
railroad
to
which
such
services
are
incidental.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
now
to
the
impact
of
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
upon
--
or
the
conflict
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
upon
this
section,
but
i
want
to
return
to
this
section
later
on
to
point
out
the
construction
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
construction
of
similar
statutes
by
the
courts.
but
--
and
as
i've
said
at
the
very
beginning,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
one
section
of
the
1955
ordinance
abstracted
the
interstate
operation,
transfer
operation
being
conducted
by
the
railroads
under
202
(c)
(2).
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
the
one,
yes.
that
--
that
is
the
one
that
the
--
the
--
the
only
provision
of
the
entire
ordinance
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
invalid
was
the
one
that
required
the
railroads
to
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
obtain
an
ordinance
finding
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
this
operation
that
is
authorized
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
they're
not
specific
on
that
but
their
language
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
held
a
violation
of
the
--
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
yes.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes.
that
is
in
the
first
paragraph
of
28-31.1.
“no
license
for
any
terminal
vehicle
shall
be
issued
except
in
the
annual
renewal
of
such
license
or
upon
transfer
to
permit
replacement
of
a
vehicle
for
that
license.”
now,
that
is
the
grandfather
clause
of
section
28-31.1
because
the
record
shows
that
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance,
parmelee
was
the
only
holder
of
terminal
vehicle
licenses.
this
phraseology,
“no
license
for
any
terminal
shall
be
issued
except
in
the
annual
renewal
of
such
license.”
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
sir.
the
10-year
ordinance
was
another
one.
it
was
laid
aside.
i
mean,
the
10-year
proposal
was
one
that
was
laid
aside.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
never
went
through.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
could,
yes,
by
annual
renewal.
that
--
that
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct.
or
--
and
it
also
provides
that
not
only
by
annual
renewal
but
by
transfer
to
permit
replacement
of
a
vehicle
for
that
license
because
the
license
applies
to
a
vehicle
but
not
the
operator.
oh,
well,
i
misquote,
it
applies
to
both
--
it
applies
to
an
individual
vehicle
and
the
operator,
but
when
the
vehicle
has
to
be
replaced,
you
have
to
relicense
it.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
under
the
chapter
28
of
the
--
beginning
on
page
171
of
the
record.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
that
is
correct.
on
page
5
of
my
--
our
brief,
we
summarized
this
as
far
as
it
applies
to
terminal
vehicles,
the
provisions
of
chapter
28
that
begins
on
page
171
of
the
transcript.
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
get
to
that.
in
fact,
i'm
now
about
to
embark
upon
a
chronological
recital
of
the
developments
in
respect
to
the
regulation
of
the
transfer
operation
by
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that
is
correct.
however,
your
honor,
that
argument
first
appears
--
that
statement,
first
appears
in
mr.
grossman's
oral
argument
in
this
court.
it
is
contrary
to
mr.
grossman's
personal
position
in
the
courts
below.
it
is
contrary
to
the
official
position
of
the
city
of
chicago
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
i
think
there
--
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
--
the
court
of
the
--
united
states
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit,
both
held
that
the
28-31.1
is
applicable
to
this
transfer
operation
and
they
did
so
at
the
particular
behest
of
the
city
of
chicago
who
urged
that
this
applies.
now,
as
far
as
the
question
of
construction
by
the
state
courts,
i
want
to
pay
attention
to
that
a
little
bit
later
on.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i
--
i
don't
like
--
i
don't
like
to
engage
in
personalities
but
i'm
going
to
add
one
more
qualification
to
that
if
he's
right
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
and
if
he
can
bind
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago
which
i
doubt
that
the
argument
disappears.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
you
--
you
would
have
if
certain
things
were
true,
but
you
don't
have,
your
honor.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i'll
get
to
that.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
all
right.
now
we
--
we,
for
many
years,
the
city
of
chicago
has
regulated
the
interstation
transfer
service
that
is
prior
to
october
1
of
1955.
the
interstation
transfer
service
had
been
performed
by
parmelee
transportation
company
as
agent
of
the
railroads.
and
the
city
of
chicago,
by
chapter
28
of
the
chicago
municipal
code,
had
regulated
the
operation
and
those
provisions
are
summarized
on
page
five
of
our
brief
and
they
include
licensing
for
purpose
of
regulation,
a
$25
license
fee
for
defrayal
of
the
cost
of
regulation,
and
various
of
the
common
safety
regulations
ordinarily
embraced
in
the
general
term
police
power.
now,
i
believe
the
sequence
of
--
chronological
sequence
of
events,
the
calendar
sequence
of
events
is
extremely
important
here
not
only
on
the
merits
of
the
controversy
but
on
the
point
that
it
has
been
talked
about
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
namely,
on
the
construction
and
the
application
of
the
ordinance.
on
june
13,
1955,
the
railroads
publicly
announced
that
as
of
october
1,
1955
they
were
discontinuing
their
arrangements
with
parmelee
and
that
they
had
made
a
contract
with
a
new
corporation,
railroad
transfer
service,
incorporated,
the
party
here,
and
that
beginning
with
october
1,
1955,
railroad
transfer
service,
incorporated
would
take
over
the
transfer
operation
of
passengers
between
stations
in
chicago
that
had
been
conducted
by
parmelee.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
sir.
i'd
like
to
clear
that
out.
no
railroad
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
but
i
want
to
say
it.
no
railroad
owns
or
any
railroad
man
owns
a
nickel's
worth
of
interest
in
railroad
transfer
service
incorporated.
it's
--
it's
strictly
outside.
the
--
but
as
i
said,
on
june
13,
the
railroads
made
that
announcement.
parmelee
immediately
communicated
that
information
to
the
chairman
of
the
public
transportation
committee
of
the
chicago
city
council
who
was,
of
course,
an
older
body.
on
june
16,
three
days
later,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
introduced
in
the
chicago
city
council
an
ordinance
that
would
have
given
parmelee
a
10-year
exclusive
franchise
to
transport
--
to
transfer
railway
passengers
of
any
sort
between
the
railway
stations
in
chicago.
that
ordinance
was
laid
aside.
it
never
came
before
the
city
council.
the
ordinance
is
commented
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
appears
in
the
record.
but
it's
--
the
only
--
its
only
importance
here
is
just
the
face
of
the
history.
however,
on
july
26th,
1955,
the
city
of
chicago
passed
the
ordinance
that
appears
on
pages
44
and
45
of
the
record
and
which
is
also
set
out
on
pages
7
and
8
of
our
brief.
now,
the
council
also
amended
two
other
--
another
provision
of
the
ordinance.
prior
to
this
amendment,
the
ordinance
provided
that
no
one
should
have
a
license,
a
terminal
vehicle
license,
that
is
to
transport
passengers
between
chicago
passenger
stations
unless
he
had
a
contract
with
one
or
more
railroads.
this
ordinance
of
july
26th,
1955
repealed
that
provision
and
left
it
wide
open.
i
mean,
it
no
longer
made
a
necessity
of
having
a
contract
with
the
railroads
as
a
--
to
obtain
a
terminal
vehicle
license,
but
it
did
then
go
ahead
in
section
28-31.1
and
did
two
things.
it,
in
effect,
said
that
gave
--
gave
permanent,
perpetual
automatic
grandfather
rights
to
all
license
that's
outstanding,
and
the
record
is
clear
that
they
were
held
by
parmelee.
then
it
provided
that
no
one
else,
and
that
might
just
as
well
have
said
that
railroad
transfer
service
incorporated
shall
not
obtain
a
terminal
vehicle
license
until
they
have
applied
to
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
for
terminal
vehicle
licenses,
and
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
has
found
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
the
issue
of
the
licenses
and
the
--
the
various
categories
of
considerations
that
the
public
vehicle
license
commissioner
can
take
into
consideration
including
paragraph
(4),
“any
other
facts
which
the
commissioner
may
deem
relevant.”
now,
i
want
to
read
just
a
few
lines
to
refer
to
that
ordinance
power
of
the
city
council.
the
ordinance
goes
further
said,
“if
the
commissioner
shall
report
--,”
and
i'm
reading
from
page
eight
of
my
brief,
“if
the
commissioner
shall
report
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
additional
terminal
vehicle
service,
the
council
by
ordinance
may
fix
the
maximum
number
of
terminal
vehicle
licenses
to
be
issued
not
to
exceed
the
number
recommended
by
the
commissioner.”
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
said
earlier,
held
that
that
particular
provision
obstructed
the
interstate
transfer
of
passengers
by
motor
vehicle
and
was
invalid.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
all
of
the
rest
of
the
ordinance
was
valid
and
applicable
and
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
now,
i
just
want
to
call
this
to
your
attention.
that
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed,
we
certainly
think
it
should
be,
the
situation
in
respect
to
the
transfer
of
passengers
in
chicago
and
the
regulation
by
the
city
of
chicago
will
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
--
will
be
precisely
the
same
regulation
to
which
parmelee
was
subject
for
many
years.
there'd
be
no
change
in
it
at
all.
the
only
difference
will
be
that
transfer
instead
of
parmelee
will
be
the
railroads'
transfer
agent.
in
other
words,
to
paraphrase
the
famous
phrase,
we
think
that
what
was
good
enough
for
parmelee
over
the
years
is
good
enough
for
transfer.
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
a
license
for
identification.
a
$25
license
fee
for,
i
presume
it's
not
a
tax.
i
presumed
it's
a
police-power
fee
for
defrayment
of
the
cost
of
regulation,
various
requirements
to
have
a
clean
and
sanitary
and
safe
vehicle,
filing
of
insurance
policies
with
the
city,
and
i
think
you
can
say
in
general
summary,
just
the
various
ordinary
police
power
regulations
of
traffic
in
a
large
city.
now,
i
want
to
call
--
in
that
connection,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
this.
this
1955
amendment
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
invalid
was
not
like
some
motor
vehicle
regulatory
ordinances
that
are
--
or
laws
that
this
court
has
held
valid.
this
was
not
aimed
at
a
type
of
traffic
deemed
undesirable
or
as
to
which
particular
regulation
was
required
because
of
this
fact
that
parmelee
was
given
perpetual
grandfather
rights
to
operate.
in
other
words,
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago
was
not
striking
at
the
industry
or
at
a
type
of
vehicle
operation.
for
instance,
like
it
wasn't
saying
that
nobody
can
operate
if
his
truck
weighs
over
so
much
or
that
a
particular
type
--
specialized-type
of
motor
vehicle
traffic
can
be
taxed
higher
than
other
types.
they
were
merely
saying
--
they
were
merely
saying
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago
is
going
to
arrogate
to
itself
to
determine
who
shall
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
--
this
court
has
held
beginning
back
with
gibbons
against
ogden
and
in
numerous
cases
since,
that
the
states
have
no
right
to
say,
who
on
a
selected
basis
between
two
types
of
candidates
or
operators,
the
states
have
no
power
to
say
who
to
select,
who
shall
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
may
not
be
entirely
relevant
right
at
this
point
of
the
argument
but
i
think
that
this
case
presents
a
very
striking
parallel
to
gibbons
against
ogden
because
the
state
of
new
york
didn't
object
to
steamboats
at
all
on
the
rivers.
all
it
said
was
that
any
steamboat
that
operates
on
the
river
must
have
a
license
from
the
state
of
new
york
and
we
won't
let
any
other
steamboats
operate
on
the
river.
gibbons
had
a
federal
posting
license
which
certainly
if
you
will
examine
the
old
posting
license
act.
it
actually
gave
less
powers
and
imposed
less
duties
than
section
202
(c)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
but
in
gibbons
against
ogden,
this
court
held
that
the
federal
posting
license
act
superseded
the
power
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
grant
an
exclusive
license
to
fulton
and
livingston
for
steamboat
traffic.
and
if
your
honors
please,
the
city
of
chicago,
some
130
or
more
years
later
is
trying
here
to
do
precisely
what
this
court
said
the
state
of
new
york
could
not
do
in
gibbons
against
ogden.
as
a
matter
of
interest
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
sir,
and
neither
does
transfer.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no,
sir.
under
--
we
do
not
need
in
order
to
--
you
see,
under
section
202
(c)
(2),
it
is
the
railroads
who
are
performing
the
service.
and
under
section
202
(c)
(2),
the
--
the
railroads
have
the
authority
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
operate
and
it
is
a
railroad
operation,
so
that
the
agent
who
is
operating
for
them
does
not
need
any
authority.
the
agent
operates
under
the
authority
of
the
railroads.
that
--
that
is
very
clear
under
the
decisions.
the
--
illustrating
that
is
the
--
are
the
decisions
of
this
court
holding
that
in
--
in
grandfather
rights
cases
where
an
agent
has
been
operating
during
the
grandfather
period
for
a
motor
carrier
and
performing
all
of
the
physical
services,
the
motor
carrier
itself
gets
a
grandfather
rights
and
not
the
agent.
in
other
words,
the
--
under
section
202
(c)
(2),
the
transfer
is
in
fact
simply
its
identity
is
merged
into
the
identity
of
the
railroads
for
purpose
of
regulation.
so
neither
it
nor
parmelee,
in
performing
this
service
for
the
railroads,
needs
a
certificate.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
not
to
perform
the
motor
carrier
operation.
of
course,
the
railroads
have
permanent
grandfather
rights
under
the
part
1
one
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
operate
passenger
trains
and
ships
into
chicago.
and
by
section
202
(c)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
railroads
are
given
perpetual
franchises
to
operate
motor
vehicles
in
transfer,
collection,
or
delivery
service
within
terminal
areas.
that's
where
the
--
in
other
words,
if
it
were
not
for
section
202
(c)
(2),
any
person
performing
this
service
or
the
railroads
if
they
were
performing
it
themselves,
would
have
to
have
a
certificate
under
part
two
of
the
interstate
commerce
act;
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
but
section
202
(c)
gives
the
railroads
in
effect,
permanent
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
grant
a
permanent
grandfather
rights
i
suppose
they
could
be
styled
to
conduct
this
terminal
operation.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
it
goes
--
does
more
than
that.
it
--
it
relieves
them
of
the
necessity
of
applying
to
the
commission
for
a
certificate.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
derives
from
the
contract.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes.
oh,
yes.
well,
did
this
answer
your
question?
the
railroads,
if
they
wanted
to
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
yes.
yes.
and
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
yes,
but
that
is
if
you
wanted
to
--
wanted
to
lose
the
value
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
if
i
understand
your
question,
right
--
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i
believe
i
do.
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
the
railroads
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
parmelee.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
the
chicago
did
acquiesce
in
this
--
to
this
extent
that
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
yes.
they
did
this
because,
as
i
said
prior
to
july
26,
1955,
the
ordinance
provided
that
no
one
could
have
a
license
to
transfer
passengers
unless
he
had
a
contract
with
the
railroad.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i
don't
know.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i've
never
even
thought
of
that
and
it's
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
maybe
i
can
approach
it
from
this
angle.
under
section
202
(c)
(2),
i
think
the
railroads
have
a
right
to
select
their
agent.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
now,
i
can
see
--
as
long
as
the
railroads
have
that
right
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
i
can
see
no
reason
why
chicago
can't
say,
“well,
alright.
we'll
--,”
or
conversely,
the
city
of
chicago
can
say,
“we'll
give
a
terminal
vehicle
license
to
anyone
who
has
a
contract
with
the
railroads.”
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
or
--
yes,
they
could
do
that.
oh
--
oh
i'm
--
the
city
of
chicago
can
let
anybody
operate.
but
the
city
of
chicago
can't
say
to
the
railroads,
“you've
got
to
divide
your
business
among
john
doe
and
richard
row
and
parmelee
and
transfer.”
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
i
don't
think
they
can
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
no.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i
certainly
concede
that
and
if
i
understand
mr.
grossman
correctly,
i
think
he
does.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
just
as
an
independent
operation.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
no.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
it's
not
in
the
record.
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know
that
i've
seen
them
lately.
but
for
a
long
time
after
transfer
started
to
operate,
the
parmelee
vehicles
were
parked
right
outside
the
stations.
and
i
suppose
they
got
passengers,
although
i
never
actually
saw
anybody
get
into
their
vehicles,
i
never
once.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
yes,
they
do.
they
come
right
into
the
terminus.
you
can
--
in
any
station
in
chicago,
you
can
get
out
of
your
train
and
ride
under
the
train
ship.
there
will
be
taxi
cab
service
of
yellow,
brown,
black,
and
white.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
we
don't
want
to
stop
parmelee
from
doing
anything.
all
we
want
is
the
right
to
operate
our
transfer
vehicles
as
we're
authorized
to
do
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
the
city
of
chicago
says
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
without
having
the
--
no
without
having
the
city
of
chicago
pass
an
ordinance
saying
that
we
can
do
it.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
no.
no,
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
go
to
that
point
now.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i
don't
have
much
time
remaining
but
i
would
like
to
go
to
that
point.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
that's
it
exactly.
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
thinking
of
a
case
like
toomer
against
witsell
in
which
this
court
held
that
where
these
--
the
state
law
is
clear
--
where
the
state
statute
or
an
ordinance
is
perfectly
clear
on
the
states
and
it's
perfectly
clear
and
everybody
has
agreed
what
it
does
and
what
it's
intended
to
do
that
it's
just
simply,
either
gestured
or
remitted
to
the
state
courts,
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
toomer
against
witsell.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
well
now,
let
me
go
to
that.
let
me
go
to
that
point
right
now.
this
--
this
argument
that
was
made
by
mr.
grossman
in
the
last
15
or
20
minutes
he
made,
is
something
new
in
the
case
and
if
i
may
give
my
own
personal
view
of
it,
i
think
it's
a
kind
of
a
wheel
of
the
west
to
get
us
all
back
into
the
morass
in
which
the
railroads
and
transfer
found
themselves
in
the
fall
of
1955,
and
i
will
now
proceed
to
tell
you
why.
the
railroads
and
transfer
in
their
complaint
in
the
district
court
made
this
allegation
and
this
is
a
form
of
allegation
i'll
admit
but
it
happened
to
be
true.
the
railroad
said
this
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
on
pages
6
and
7
of
the
record,
paragraph
(4)
of
page
6
and
7
of
the
record.
“the
terminal
lines
and
transfer
have
specifically
and
repeatedly
advised
the
defendant
in
the
city
of
chicago
through
the
defendant's
daley,
the
mayor,
melaniphy
and
flynn,
its
duly
elected
or
appointed
officials
that
the
provisions
of
said
ordinance
did
not
apply
to
the
operations
of
transfer
pursuant
to
the
agency
contract.
and
further,
that
a
said
ordinance
did
apply
to
such
operations,
said
ordinance
was
void
as
an
attempt
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
and
contravention
of
the
commerce
clause
despite
said
advice.”
now,
these
are
allegations
of
fact,
particularly
this
one.
despite
said
advice,
the
defendant
in
the
city
of
chicago,
acting
through
the
defendant's
daley,
melaniphy,
o'connor,
and
flynn,
its
duly
authorized
officials,
has
asserted
and
continues
to
assert
that
the
ordinance
is
valid
and
enforceable
against
transfer.
and
that
the
defendant,
the
city
of
chicago,
acting
through
its
officers,
agents,
servants,
and
employees,
would
attempt
to
enforce
said
ordinance
against
transfer
as
a
violator
thereof
by
arresting
transfer's
drivers
operating
its
passenger
motor
vehicles
and
so
forth.”
well,
one
more
important
line,
“used
in
the
performance
of
transfer's
operations
under
the
agency
contract.”
now,
those
are
allegations
of
fact
and
they
were
all
admitted
by
the
motion
of
the
defendants
for
summary
judgment.
that's
not
only
true,
of
course,
as
a
matter
of
law
but
the
defendant
stated
in
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
pages
71,
72
of
the
record.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
it
is.
it
is
the
one
that
under
the
amendment
of
1955
requires
us
to
get
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
under
28-31.1.
but
it
is
the
--
before
28-31.1
was
enacted
in
july
of
1955,
the
terminal
vehicle
license
did
not
require
proof
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
but
the
terminal
vehicle
license
that
he's
talked
about
here
is
the
one
that
requires
proof
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
28-31.1.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
the
law
was
in
effect.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
this
complaint
was
filed
october
24,
1955.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
after
the
ordinance
went
into
effect.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
yes,
and
in
other
--
other
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
all
i
can
say
is
this.
that
in
paragraph
(4),
it's
plain
english
and
in
--
in
the
city's
motion
for
summary
judgment
they
said
this
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
71
and
72
of
the
record.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
--
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
but
i
merely
wanted
to
point
out
that
they
gilded
to
lily
or
frosted
the
cake
or
something
by
saying,
“in
support
of
said
motion,
defendant
state
that
there
is
no
genuine
issue
as
to
any
material
fact
contained
in
the
complaint.”
now,
in
other
words,
they
admitted
that
they
would
arrest
their
drivers
under
the
agency
contract.
now,
they're
talking
about
the
operation
under
this
contract.
they're
talking
about
that
specifically.
well,
let's
go
on
a
little
way.
the
district
court
filed
a
memorandum
opinion
in
which
the
district
court
held
the
ordinance
valid
and
enforceable
and
applicable
against
this
operation.
that
was
the
whole
business
including
this
public
convenience
and
necessity
requirement.
and
as
is
customary,
the
district
court
asked
counsel
to
supply
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
and
in
paragraph
(2)
of
the
proposed
conclusion
of
law
submitted
by
the
city,
by
mr.
grossman
in-person,
and
that
is
on
page
122
of
the
record,
this
was
the
conclusion
of
law
submitted.
“transfer
operates
its
motor
vehicles
on
public
ways
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
for
hire
from
place
to
place
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
as
provided
in
section
28-2
of
the
ordinance.
now,
section
28-2
of
the
ordinance
is
the
fishnet
or
the
drag
net
that
catches
everybody.
if
you're
within
28-2,
you're
within
the
ordinance,
and
that
was
mr.
grossman's
own
contribution
to
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court.
that
--
that
--
and
that
was
the
city's
position.
well,
and
i
should
add
to
that
that
in
the
record
155,
159,
conclusion
of
law
number
5,
the
district
court
adopted
that
conclusion
recommended
by
mr.
grossman.
now
--
and
the
district
court
specifically
held
as
a
conclusion
of
law
and
dismissed
our
complaint.
in
other
words,
and
held
that
the
whole
ordinance
including
this
public
convenience
and
necessity
section
was
enforceable
against
us.
we
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
what
did
the
city
do
there?
the
city
came
in
and
by
its
--
we
have
filed
a
certified
copy
of
the
city's
brief
and
all
of
the
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
matter
with
this
court.
and
so
i
--
and
i
have
set
out
in
--
i
set
out
on
page
14
of
our
brief
the
quotation
from
the
court,
from
the
city's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
keep
in
mind
that
this
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
city's
official
brief
signed
by
the
corporation
council
and
the
paragraph,
i
won't
read
all
of
the
paragraph,
but
on
--
i
call
your
attention
to
that
language
on
page
14
of
our
brief
that
the
framers
of
the
ordinance
in
question
intended
to
regulate
the
business
carried
on
by
transfer
wholly
within
the
city
of
chicago
as
hardly
subject
to
challenge.
now
that's
what
the
city
was
seeing
back
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
down
at
the
--
and
then
the
city
goes
ahead
in
its
brief
and
quotes
several
sections
of
the
ordinance
including
28-1.
and
the
city
lines
up
its
discussion
by
saying
in
the
last
sentence,
“a
more
accurate
description
of
the
business
engaged
in
by
transfer
would
be
hard
to
find.”
now,
if
the
court
please,
after
the
city
of
chicago
has
obtained
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
at
its
own
request
and
upon
its
own
solemn
assurances
to
those
two
courts,
that
this
ordinance
is
applicable
to
the
transfer
operation,
can
counsel
for
the
city
come
before
this
court
and
make
a
representation
to
say
that
the
city
does
not
so
contend?
if
he
can,
why
then,
we
might
just
as
well
abolish
all
the
rules
of
procedure
and
litigation.as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
couldn't
make
that
contention
in
the
illinois
courts.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
city
of
chicago
against
the
university
of
chicago
cited
on
page
15
of
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago
had
taken
the
position
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
circuit
court
that
a
certain
ordinance
was
valid.
and
then
as
suit
of
their
convenience
or
suit
of
their
--
they
want
to
suit
their
convenience
as
in
this
case,
they
took
the
position
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
the
ordinance
was
invalid.
and
here
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
rule
of
this
court
should
follow
in
this
case.
“having
alleged
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
in
its
pleading
and
proceeded
to
a
hearing
on
that
theory,
the
city
cannot
now
be
heard
to
say
that
the
circuit
court
erred
in
adopting
its
view.”
and
to
paraphrase
that,
your
honors,
we
say
that
having
alleged
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
ordinance
is
applicable
including
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
is
applicable
to
the
transfer
operation
from
having
one
on
both
issues,
mind
you
that
both
courts
--
the
courts
decided
those
two
issues
in
favor
of
the
city,
the
city
cannot
now
be
heard
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
adopting
its
view.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i
think
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
go
to
our
complaint
to
resolve
what
he
said
there
than
what
labuy
said
--
judge
labuy
said
in
his
opinion
but
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
true
enough.
we
did
urge
that.
but
the
point
is
that
we
lost.
we
lost
on
that
issue.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well,
i
think
it
is
myself.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
well
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
let's
--
let's
get
right
at
that.
let's
get
right
at
that
in
the
five
minutes
i
have
remaining.
actually,
i
don't
believe
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
the
case
on
this
except
some
very
early
observations
of
commentators
on
the
constitution.
and
i
can't
identify
them
now,
but
i
don't
believe
the
city
of
chicago
can
go
to
a
court
and
say,
“we
want
you
to
hold
that
one
of
our
ordinances
does
not
apply
to
transfer
because
you
have
before
you
here
the
legislative
body.”
the
city
of
chicago,
if
it
wanted
to
get
rid
of
this
legislation
on
the
theory
they
now
suggest,
could
pass
a
two-line
ordinance
tomorrow
saying
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
provisions
of
this
do
not
apply
to
the
transfer
operation
and
what
would
happen
why
this
whole
litigation
would
be
dismissed
as
moot
clear
back
through
the
district
court
and
everything
would
be
wiped
out.
why
doesn't
the
city
of
chicago
do
that?
they
don't
do
it
because
they're
just
not
serious.
they
just
are
not
serious
in
this
because
every
time
when
it
has
served
their
purpose,
they
have
said
this
ordinance
applied
to
this.
now,
when
they
find
a
judgment
holding
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
on,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
entirely
sound
grounds,
they
take
this
wheel
of
the
west
gamblers
to
avoid
their
position
they've
taken
in
the
courts
below
and
get
back
into
the
courts
of
illinois.
if
they
get
back
into
the
courts
of
illinois,
i
tell
you
gentlemen
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court,
the
city
of
chicago
will
go
to
an
illinois
court
and
they
will
say
this
ordinance
applies.
they
have
done
that
on
every
occasion
in
the
past
when
it
served
their
purpose
and
they'll
do
it
again.
now,
getting
back
then
to
this
issue
of
remission
to
the
illinois
courts.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh,
if
they
were
stipulated
but
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
grave
doubts
about
what
would
happen
in
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
chicago.
of
course,
well,
another
thing
too.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes.
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
argument
on
applicability,
if
you'll
examine
the
complaint,
was
not
on
applicability
but
it
was
simply
to
the
effect
that
since
this
is
interstate
commerce,
it
doesn't
apply.
well
now,
it
does
apply
in
terms
and
is
in
conflict.
now,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
toomer
against
witsell
and
other
cases
cited
on
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
to
the
effect
that
where
in
this
case
a
litigant
has
taken
positions
and
--
and
the
statute
is
clear,
there
is
no
occasion
for
admission
to
state
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
you
have
one
minute
--
one
minute
or
so
left,
mr.
grossman,
and
i
wish
you
would
address
yourself
first
to
the
question
of
whether
the
city
of
chicago
would
be
willing
in
this
--
in
this
proceeding
to
stipulate
that
this
ordinance
does
not
apply
to
your
cause.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
isn't
that
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
enough
answer
to
--
that's
enough
answer
to
that.
