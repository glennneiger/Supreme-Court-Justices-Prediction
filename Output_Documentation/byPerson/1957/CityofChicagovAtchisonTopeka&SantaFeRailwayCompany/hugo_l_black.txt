black
and
had
a
contract
with
the
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
parmelee's
pay
ride
or
his
coupon?
could
he
use
that
in
parmelee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
after
the
new
ordinance,
then
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
coupon
was
--
would
that
be
good
with
transfer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
for
parmelee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
hold
it
invalid
as
a
violation
of
the
constitution
or
as
a
violation
of
the
acts
of
congress
which
you've
just
referred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
parmelee
--
does
parmelee
have
a
certificate
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
has
parmelee
had
one
heretofore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
railroads
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
railroads
have
a
certificate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you.
that
said
violating
the
ordinance
if
the
terminal
vehicle
licenses
are
the
ones
which
you
say
requires
you
to
get
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity,
or
is
it
a
different
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
that
if
the
law
wasn't
in
effect
at
that
time
this
complaint
was
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
law
was
in
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
the
ordinance
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
clear
i
presume
from
both
argues
then
that
this
charges
that
they
were
threatening
you
if
you
did
not
get
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
under
31?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
shakes
his
head
off.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[laughs]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
instead
of
making
a
statement
here
to
this
effect
or
argue
that
he
would
file
a
stipulation
--
he
had
filed
a
stipulation
representing
his
client,
stipulating
that
your
side
is
not
included
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
there's
no
controversy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
do
you
think
you'd
have
any
remedy
if
they
would
stipulate
here
to
that
effect
and
then
went
back
to
a
totally
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gather
he's
saying
that
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
might
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
position
it
did
what
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understood
mr.
mathews,
he
contended
that
under
302
(c)
(2),
the
congress
has
authorized
the
railroads
themselves
to
choose
an
agent
either
by
--
by
contract
such
as
to
do
the
specific
work,
kind
of
work.
if
that
interpretation
is
accepted,
would
you
still
say
that
they
could
be
revised
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
you
already
had
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
do,
however,
make
a
contract,
how
can
anyone
else
require
them
to
be
anything
more
than
to
survive
by
this
act
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
based
on
their
qualifications?
if
--
if
they
have
made
the
railroad
eligible,
congress
has
made
the
railroads
eligible
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
the
railroads
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
will
they
have
to
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
congress
has
said
they
can
function
that
way,
whatever
right
the
city
might
have
to
punish
them
for
some
violation
of
law,
can
it
say
they
cannot
function
if
congress
had
said
they
can?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
saying
that
this
statute,
whatever
it
does,
does
not
of
itself
automatically
allow
railroads
to
operate
this
kind
of
business
in
chicago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
automatically
guarantee
that
they
should
be
allowed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
congress
has
said
that
hayes
could
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
independent
contractors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
your
total
argument
on
the
statute,
isn't
that
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
depends
on
the
interpretation
then
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
insist
that
that
is
the
equivalent
of
saying
the
railroads
shall
have
the
right
to
make
a
contract
with
such
a
person
or
agent
that
you
see
fit
to
carry
these
passengers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you're
wrong
in
that
interpretation,
you
have
to
go
back
to
your
constitutional
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
kurland's
argument
for
this
event?
it's
been
frequently
held
that
at
least
in
some
cases
and
i
thought
(inaudible)
that
the
mere
fact
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
in
the
absence
of
regulation,
the
powers
don't
with
the
state
(inaudible).
and
mr.
kurland's
argument,
as
i
understood
it,
in
reference
to
the
statute
was
this,
one
argument.
that
the
statute
does
give
the
commission
power
to
regulate
it
under
one,
part
1
of
the
act
as
a
carrier,
although
it's
not
a
carrier
but
it
gives
that
regulatory.
but
they
haven't
made
any
effort
to
do
it
and
therefore
the
power
lines
don't
--
you
can't
claim
that
--
the
city
without
a
power
by
the
state,
without
power
to
demand
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
what
do
you
say
to
that
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
maybe
i
was
wrong
about
this
argument
but
maybe
i
didn't
make
it
briefly
and
clearly.
i
understood
it
not
to
deny
that
congress
had
entered
the
field
and
authorized
the
commission
to
regulate
where
he
said
it
hadn't
done
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
established
any
rules
supervising
the
selection
of
agents
by
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
him
to
say
it
hadn't
done
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i'm
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
that
the
argument
was
and
since
it
hadn't
done
so,
you
couldn't
claim
that
the
statute
is
the
equivalent
of
a
certificate
that
the
power
is
there
lying
dormant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter?
it's
not
quite
clear
what
you
said
here
that
they
do
not
have
to
get
a
license
on
the
federal
government
to
this
--
this
particular
motor
carrier
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
doesn't
have
to
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
--
does
that
end
your
case
so
far
as
the
act
is
concerned?
if
the
congress
has
constitutionally
given
you
the
power
to
make
the
selection,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
congress
had
given
you
the
power
to
make
the
selection
of
somebody
to
do
the
carrying?
why?
what
difference
does
that
make
to
your
contention?
would
you
not
still
claim
that
the
city
can't
take
away
that
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
a
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
select
somebody
by
a
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
maybe
that's
not
the
equivalent
of
a
certificate
that
they
had
authorized.
but
isn't
that
your
point
now
or
is
it
that
that's
the
equivalent
of
an
authority
granted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
is
that
they
had
the
power
to
give
it,
that
it
has
authorized
you
to
get
somebody
to
do
that.
