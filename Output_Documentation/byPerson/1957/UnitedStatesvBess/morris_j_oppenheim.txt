mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
in
this
bess
case
two
issues,
one
of
which
has
been
argued
and
which
i
had
hoped
would
require
of
the
expenditure
of
only
a
small
account
or
small
amount
of
time
on
my
part.
and
they
made
the
transferee
question.
however
i
should
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
transferee
question
but
i
will
reserve
that
until
after
i
have
talked
with
respect
to
the
lien
theory.
we
intend
to
argue
the
merits
of
the
lien
question,
but
first
we
interpose
this
objection
to
its
being
considered
by
the
court
at
this
time.
the
tax
lien
theory
is
an
entirely
separate
clause
of
action,
separate
and
apart
from
the
transferee
liability
if
one
exists.
now,
the
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
did
not
plea
the
lien
theory,
it
wasn't
presented
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
decision.
the
case
was
presented
to
the
court
upon
a
stipulation
of
facts.
the
stipulation
necessarily
was
directed
towards
a
presentation
of
those
issues
which
the
pleadings
had
raised.
the
lien
theory
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
answering
brief
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
same
objection
was
made
and
it
was
also
argued
on
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
is
silent
with
respect
to
the
lien
issue
so
much
for
that.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
yes.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
on
the
merits,
yes.
but
if
the
stipulation
had
been
framed
it
might
possibly
with
the
view
towards
the
tax
lien
issue
it
may
probably
--
it
may
possibly
have
been
framed
somewhat
differently.
let
me
illustrate.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
or
perhaps
i
did
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
perhaps
i
misunderstand
--
misunderstood
your
honor.
do
you
mean
that
if
the
stipulation
had
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
--
if
the
complaint
had
raised
the
lien
theory
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
yes.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
then
i
think
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
the
lien
would
have
been
pleaded.
the
lien
issue
would
have
been
--
been
pleaded.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
oh,
i
--
oh,
i
am
sorry,
i
--
no.
in
that
case
i
think
no
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lien
theory
is
an
affirmative
course
of
action
which
must
be
affirmatively
pleaded
and
that
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
yes.
he
has
a
judgment
against
mrs.
bess.
the
court
of
appeals
modified
the
district
court's
judgment
by
reducing
the
amount
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
it
might
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
that
if
this
did
not
create
or
if
this
was
not
the
basis
for
a
completely
separate
cause
of
action
i
would
have
to
concede
his
argument.
and
this
i
think
is
the
difference.
now,
i
should
like
to
move
on
to
the
merits
of
the
lien
theory.
our
first
point
is
this.
section
3670
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
a
section
which
imposes
the
lien.
it
does
not
impose
a
lien
with
respect
to
tax
due,
it
specifically
sets
up
conditions
which
we
say
are
conditions
precedent
or
conditions
perquisite
to
the
arising
of
a
lien.
these
conditions
are
that
a
tax
must
be
assessed
and
demand
for
payment
made
and
this
is
the
material
portion
of
the
statute
if
the
taxpayer
then
neglects
or
refuses
to
pay,
there
shall
be
a
lien.
the
stipulation
of
facts
in
this
case
sets
forth
that
the
taxes
for
the
years
1945
and
1946
were
assessed
on
the
very
same
day
pursuant
to
a
waiver
signed
by
the
taxpayer
on
the
very
same
day.
the
demand
for
payment
was
made
upon
the
taxpayer
upon
the
very
same
day.
that
is
all
of
these
on
different
dates
but
simultaneously
with
respect
to
both
years.
the
stipulation
then
sets
forth
that
from
that
point
to
the
date
of
his
death,
herman
bess,
the
taxpayer
was
making
periodic
payments.
the
stipulation
however
as
drawn
would
seem
to
--
would
seem
to
indicate
that
these
payments
were
made
only
with
respect
to
1945,
that
no
payments
seemingly
were
made
with
respect
to
1946.
it
is
our
contention
that
these
periodic
payments
which
were
made,
were
made
with
respect
to
one
tax
liability
although
this
was
a
liability
for
more
than
one
year,
and
that
by
entering
into
this
course
of
making
periodic
payments
which
must
have
been
i
assume
we
can
infer
they
must
have
been
with
a
consent
of
the
tax
collector
not
only
has
the
government
failed
in
its
burden
of
affirmatively
establishing
that
there
was
neglect
or
refusal
but
i
believe
the
stipulation
contradicts
this
and
on
the
contrary
establishes
that
the
taxpayer
neither
neglected
nor
refused
and
therefore
we
say
that
no
lien
arose
by
virtue
of
these
two
tax
years.
and
there
are
only
those
two
years
involved
of
the
balance
of
tax
which
the
government
is
seeking
to
recover
is
for
three
years,
the
year
1947
a
comparatively
small
amount
was
assessed
after
mr.
bess
had
died.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
lien
issue,
we
say
that
a
life
insurance
policy
is
a
contract
pursuant
to
which
there
are
many
rights
that
is
all
of
the
parties,
the
insurance
company,
the
insured,
and
the
beneficiary
who
is
named
in
this
policy
have
contractual
rights.
again,
section
3670
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
imposes
the
lien
imposes
this
lien
upon,
i
quote,
“the
property
or
rights
to
property
of
the
taxpayer.”
therefore,
if
a
lien
did
arise
in
favor
of
the
government
in
this
case,
the
lien
could
only
impinge
upon
the
property
or
rights
to
property
of
the
taxpayer
who
is
herman
bess.
the
law
in
new
jersey
where
these
people
reside
is
specific
and
clear.
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
and
the
law
is
well
established
in
new
jersey
to
this
effect
namely
that
the
rights
of
a
beneficiary
can
only
be
eliminated
by
changing
the
beneficiary
pursuant
to
the
terms
written
into
the
contract.
the
courts
have
gone
so
far
in
new
jersey
as
to
hold
in
the
case
of
anderson
national
bank,
it's
cited
in
my
brief,
a
case
in
which
the
insured
borrowed
money
from
a
bank
and
made
an
assignment
of
the
insurance
policy
to
the
bank
as
collateral
for
the
loan.
before
the
loan
was
paid,
the
insured
died,
the
question
then
arose
whether
the
proceeds
were
to
be
paid
to
the
beneficiary,
the
wife
of
the
insured
or
were
to
be
paid
to
the
bank
who
held
the
assignment.
in
a
well
considered
opinion
which
was
later
affirmed
by
the
highest
court
in
new
jersey
at
that
time,
the
court
of
errors
and
appeals.
the
court
reviewed
the
preceding
authorities
and
concluded
that
in
new
jersey
the
courts
will
enforce
the
contract,
the
life
insurance
contract
as
it
is
written
and
will
protect
the
rights
of
all
parties
to
do
otherwise
the
court
said
would
mean
to
alter
or
vary
the
terms
of
a
written
contract,
an
authority
which
the
court
had
no
power
to
do.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
yes,
your
honor.
the
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
had
been
reserved.
the
right
to
cash
surrender
the
policy
had
been
reserved
and
of
course
the
right
to
assign
the
policy
had
been
reserved
until
the
assignment
occurred.
now,
the
court
goes
further
into
the
--
into
an
analysis
of
the
insurance
policy
and
points
out
that
the
policy
itself
imposes
obligations
as
well
as
granting
rights,
namely
the
insurance
contract
imposes
an
obligation
upon
the
insurance
company
to
pay
the
beneficiary
a
fixed
amount
of
money
upon
the
death
of
the
insured,
and
although
the
insured
has
the
right
to
change
this
beneficiary,
in
the
absence
of
such
a
change
the
insurance
company
is
not
relieved
of
its
obligation
under
the
contract,
and
must
pay
the
beneficiary.
now,
that
being
the
case
and
since
neither
section
3670
nor
any
other
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code
defines
what
is
the
property
or
rights
to
property,
to
which
this
lien
if
one
exists,
to
which
this
lien
attaches,
it
is
our
view
that
we
must
resort
to
the
law
of
the
state
to
determine
what
is
the
property
or
the
rights
to
property
of
the
taxpayer,
we
contend
and
we
urge
upon
this
court,
that
in
new
jersey
the
rights
to
property
of
herman
bess
the
insured
were
a
mere
option
terminable
at
his
death.
that
when
he
died,
his
option
to
surrender
the
policy
for
cash
or
to
change
the
beneficiary
terminated,
that
the
obligation
of
the
insurance
company
to
pay
did
not
arise
at
that
moment,
but
arose
when
the
policy
was
taken
out,
when
the
premiums
were
paid
and
when
the
beneficiary
was
originally
designated.
we
say
then
that
if
the
government
had
a
lien
upon
the
property
or
rights
to
property
of
herman
bess,
this
lien
was
nothing
more
than
a
right
during
herman
bess'
life
time,
to
cease
or
to
compel
herman
bess
to
obtain
this
cash
surrender
value.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
government
had
sought
to
collect
the
cash
surrender
value
during
the
insured's
life
time.
until
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
property
right
which
it
could
seize.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
yes,
for
income
taxes.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
i'm
sorry,
in
an
income
tax
case.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
for
unpaid
income
taxes.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
something
to
that
effect.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
until
quite
recently
there
was
no
court
in
this
country
which
had
decided
and
there
were
several
raised,
brought
all
the
way
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
there
was
no
court
in
this
country
which
held
that
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
the
person
of
the
insured,
such
as
would
give
the
court
the
right
to
compel
him
to
surrender
the
policy.
no
court
held
until
recently
that
the
government
could
under
such
circumstances
reach
the
cash
surrender
value.
there
was
a
recent
decision,
united
states
against
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
cited
in
the
brief,
in
which
the
court
decided
that
its
judgment
directed
against
the
insurance
company,
to
pay
the
cash
surrender
value
had
the
effect
of
cancelling
the
company's
obligation
to
pay
the
beneficiary.
now,
if
the
government
had
a
lien
in
this
case,
i
concede
that
it
might
have
enforced
its
lien
by
restraint
and
by
seizure
and
in
a
proper
action
recovering
the
cash
surrender
value.
however
it
did
not
proceed
in
that
fashion.
and
it
had
lost
any
right
to
proceed
after
the
death
of
the
insured
since.
the
obligation
of
the
insurance
company
came
into
affect,
one
which
nobody
can
relieve.
i
would
like
now
to
revert
to
the
transferee
question.
it
has
been
rather
thoroughly
discussed.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
like
to
point
out
briefly
some
elements
which
apply
to
the
bess
case,
possibly
to
the
stern
case
which
was
argued
before.
the
question
basically
is
whether
a
transfer
was
made
at
such
a
time
and
under
such
circumstances
that
a
creditor
can
reach
the
property
transferred,
and
there
seems
to
be
no
consensus,
no
one
opinion
as
to
when
transfer
occurs
in
connection
with
life
insurance
policies.
this
court
as
long
ago
as
1888
in
central
national
bank
against
hume,
decided
that
the
transfer
occurred
when
the
premiums
were
paid.
i
realize
that
the
facts
stated
in
the
opinion
are
not
clear
and
possibly
there
may
not
have
been
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
insured
to
recapture
the
cash
surrender
value.
this
is
not
clear,
and
i
don't
know
whether
that
was
the
case,
but
nevertheless
in
that
case
the
court
decided
that
the
transfer
occurred
when
the
premiums
were
paid.
the
new
jersey
statute
follows
the
holding
of
the
hume
case,
and
i
might
point
out
counsel
has
called
the
new
jersey
statute
an
exemption
statute
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
new
jersey
statute
is
not
an
exemption
statute,
but
rather
a
statute
for
marshalling
the
proceeds
properly
according
to
law
between
the
beneficiary
and
any
other
party,
a
creditor
of
the
insured,
who
might
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case
be
entitled
to
recover.
and
i
say
this
because
the
new
jersey
statute
provide
specifically
that
whether
the
beneficiary
is
a
stranger,
or
the
wife
of
the
insured,
that
a
creditor
can
recover
from
the
proceeds
to
the
extent
that
the
insured
paid
premiums
(inaudible)
of
creditors.
now
this
statute
was
enacted
shortly
after,
within
a
few
years
after
the
decision
in
this
court
in
the
hume
case.
in
fact
within
one
year
after
a
court
in
new
jersey
criticized
and
refused
to
follow
the
hume
case,
and
probably
as
a
result
of
the
court's
failure
to
follow
the
hume
case.
now
i
would
--
some
courts
have
held
that
the
transfer
occurs
when
a
beneficiary
is
changed,
in
those
cases
and
i
believe
that
rowen
was
one
of
them.
the
beneficiary
at
one
time
was
the
estate,
the
executors
of
the
insured,
and
when
the
change,
when
the
beneficiary
was
changed
from
the
executors
of
the
insured
to
the
insured's
wife,
that
was
the
occasion
when
some
courts
say
the
transfer
of
the
policy
occurred.
with
the
exception
of
the
decision
in
the
bess
case
by
the
third
circuit,
i
don't
think
there
are
any
other
decisions,
at
least
i
don't
know
of
any
other
decisions,
which
hold
that
a
transfer
occurs
at
death.
and
i'd
like
for
a
moment
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
that's
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
that's
correct
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
--
and
i
--
yes.
now
i
also
want
to
point
out
perhaps
i
should
have
adverted
this
before
when
i
talked
of
the
hume
case.
in
the
hume
case
the
insurance
policies
were
taken
out
when
the
insured
was
insolvent
and
he
paid
the
premiums
when
he
was
insolvent.
the
court
in
its
decision
held
that
the
imputation
of
fraud
from
payments
or
diversions
of
property
by
a
debtor
when
he
was
insolvent
is
not
a
general
imputation
but
that
it
depends
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
particular
case
and
in
that
case
this
court
enunciated
a
doctrine
which
was
possibly
an
extension
namely
this
court
in
that
case
said
that
public
policy
recognizes
that
there
is
a
positive
legal
as
well
as
moral
obligation
upon
married
men
to
provide
for
his
wife
and
children
and
that
this
can
be
extended
to
permit
even
an
insolvent,
these
are
my
words,
even
an
insolvent
debtor
to
provide
or
divert
a
reasonable
portion
of
his
property
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
wife
and
children,
maintaining
the
man
protecting
them
in
the
event
of
his
untimely
death.
now
there
has
been
some
question
about
a
transfer
of
cash
surrender
value.
and
i
would
just
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
cash
surrender
value
is
not
a
debt,
there
is
no
relationship
of
credit-debtor
between
the
insured
and
the
insurance
company
until
such
a
time
as
the
insured
turns
the
policy
in
for
surrender.
it
is
not
a
custody
account.
the
insurance
company
is
not
holding
the
insurer's
money.
the
so-called
reserve
which
the
insurance
company
sets
up
is
its
own
money
taken
under
a
claim
of
right
and
if
the
insurance
company
itself
became
insolvent
these
funds
would
be
subject
to
payment
of
the
insurance
company's
debts.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
the
savings
bank
passbook?
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
it
differs
in
these
respects.
the
passbook
creates
a
relationship
of
debtor-creditor.
if
the
holder
of
the
book
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
correct.
but
if
the
holder
of
the
book
dies
the
fund
becomes
property
of
his
estate
which
his
executor
can
collect.
the
earnings
on
that
money
belongs
to
the
--
that
of
the
interest
belongs
to
and
is
taxable
for
income
tax
to
the
depositor.
if
a
transfer
is
made
at
death
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
well,
what
i
mean
is
this
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
what
i
mean
is
this
that
if
it
be
considered
that
the
insurance
company
holds
a
cash
surrender
value
for
the
benefit
of
each
insurer,
the
earnings
which
the
insurance
company
receives
from
that
fund
is
not
taxable
for
income
tax
to
the
insured.
there
is
no
--
even
though
there
are
accretions
this
fund
grows
in
a
sense.
that
growth,
that
accretion
is
not
properly,
is
not
considered
even
by
the
internal
revenue
code
to
be
taxable
income
to
the
insured
at
any
time
until
he
surrenders
policy
and
then
collects
more
than
he
paid
for.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
your
honor,
if
--
if
the
insured
possess
the
incidence
of
ownership
that
is
the
right
to
control
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
yes.
and
he
makes
an
assignment
--
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
--
fortuitously
and
delivers
it,
this
is
subject
to
a
gift
tax.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
that's
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
not
in
every
case
your
honor.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
there
--
there
are
several
decisions
and
in
my
opinion
they
reflect
the
best
that
the
court
can
do
under
the
circumstances.
in
some
cases
it
has
held
that
the
interpolated
terminal
reserve
which
is
fairly
close
to
cash
surrender
value
but
a
different
sum
is
the
value.
in
some
case
as
for
example
where
there
was
a
single
premium
policy
acquired
and
delivered
by
gift
within
a
short
time,
it
was
the
cost.
now
it
is
impossible
to
determine
the
exact
value
of
a
life
insurance
policy
at
any
time
because
to
illustrate
if
we
take
the
case
of
a
man
on
his
deathbed,
certainly
that
life
insurance
policy
even
if
it's
only
one
year
old
its
worth
more
than
cash
surrender
value.
and
any
speculator
would
pay
more.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
oppenheim
that
is
correct.
but
i
also
point
out
to
your
honor
that
there
are
obligations,
in
other
words
the
insured's
right
is
not
a
single
sole
right
but
is
subservient
to
other
rights.
it's
subservient
to
the
right
of
the
beneficiary,
it
is
subservient
to
the
obligation
of
the
insurance
company
itself
to
make
a
payment
of
the
proceeds
under
certain
circumstances.
i
have
sort
of
lost
myself.
my
time
is
practically
up
and
i
--
if
i
went
on
now
i
wouldn't
know
where
i
am,
i'd
[laughter].
