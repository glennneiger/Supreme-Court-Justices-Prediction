what
is
divested
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
either
state
is
it
the
law
that
when
a
man
takes
out
an
insurance
policy
that
the
beneficiary
immediately
has
such
rights
that
he
cannot
revoke
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
state
law
does
not
apply,
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
congress
has
legislated
in
connection
with
a
lot
of
matters
about
insurance,
by
this
inference,
prior
to
some
time
that
he
had
collect
--
the
government
can
collect
state
tax
and
so
forth
but
it
doesn't
seem
fit
to
adapt
this
common
law
idea
that
you
found
in
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
again,
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
--
that
they
haven't
--
that
they
have
argued
on
many
other
things
that
--
maybe
as
--
but
not
be
the
part
of
wisdom
to
incorporate
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
common
law
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
to
invoke
your
common
law
doctrine
in
order
to
sustain
your
rights
and
tax
the
--
put
the
tax
on
the
amount
equal
to
the
cash
surrender
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
mean
in
your
case
where
you
have
a
lien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
you
have
the
lien,
you
have
one
of
those,
do
you
know
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it's
occurred
to
me
as
i've
heard
the
argument
is,
neither
side
is
arguing
the
question,
maybe
it's
therefore
not
worthy
of
consideration.
the
reading
of
hume
case,
i
see
that
they
went
somewhat
on
the
general
idea
of
protection
of
the
rights
of
beneficiaries
by
the
--
someone
has
included
enough
to
buy
the
policy.
i
recall
that
congress
has
been
doing
that
over
a
number
of
years
and
bears
connection
and
your
argument
--
your
position
may
be
correct
if
adopted.
but
to
some
extent,
(inaudible)
for
beneficiaries
of
a
right
without
congress
having
done
so
specifically,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
it's
done,
it's
been
in
that
direction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
asking
us
to
take
affirmative
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
common
law
doctrine
you
urge
here
we
apply
ever
been
applied
in
connection
with
insurance
policies,
life
insurance
policies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
as
you
are
doing
--
as
you
ask
us
to
do
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
anyway
so
as
to
reduce
the
amount
that
the
beneficiaries
would
get
from
private
life
insurance
policies.
