mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
in
the
previous
references
to
this
court,
to
this
case,
the
court
has
been
informed
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
for
the
government
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
we
had
a
right
to
follow
the
insurance
payments
to
the
extent
of
the
cash
surrender
value
in
the
hands
of
the
--
that
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
deceased.
it
held
against
the
government
however,
by
limiting
the
liability
of
the
beneficiary
to
this
cash
surrender
value
and
holding
that
the
reminder
of
the
insurance
payments
were
received
free
and
clear.
the
government
petitioned
from
the
portion
of
the
judgment
against
it
and
mrs.
bess
petitioned
from
the
portion
of
the
judgment
which
held
her
liable
to
the
extent
of
the
cash
surrender
value.
now,
up
to
a
certain
point
the
facts
in
this
case
are
the
same
as
the
facts
in
the
stern
case.
the
nature
of
the
insurance
policies
is
generally
the
same.
there
were
eight
insurance
policies
involved
in
this
case
and
as
to
one
of
them
which
was
a
group
insurance
policy,
there
was
no
cash
surrender
value,
but
as
to
the
remaining
seven
there
were
substantial
cash
surrender
values.
the
premiums
were
paid
by
the
deceased
and
in
this
case
this
is
made
specific
in
the
stipulation.
the
insured
retained
the
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
to
assign
the
policies,
the
right
to
draw
down
cash
surrender
value
or
to
borrow
against
it.
when
the
taxpayer
died,
his
estate
was
insufficient
to
pay
the
amount
of
taxes
which
had
accrued
before
his
death.
there
is
one
respect
though
that
this
case
differs
from
the
stern
case
and
that
is
that
for
two
of
the
three
years
for
which
liability
is
involved,
the
assessment
was
made
and
notice
and
demand
was
given
to
the
taxpayer
before
his
death.
this
is
important
because
it
resulted
in
the
attachment
of
a
lien
to
all
of
his
property
and
rights
and
it
is
the
contention
of
the
governments
that
this
included
a
lien
with
respect
to
his
life
insurance.
but
leaving
aside
for
a
moment
the
question
of
the
existence
of
a
lien,
our
position
in
this
case
is
precisely
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
stern
case
which
has
just
been
argued.
mr.
john
f.
davis
two
of
the
years,
i'll
have
to
check
the
record
and
then
i'll
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
three
years
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it's
very
clear
from
the
--
from
the
record,
there's
no
question,
but
it's
--
well,
i'll
--
i'll
leave
it
because
there's
no
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
there's
no
problem
about
finding
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
the
--
the
situation
is
the
same,
so
far
as
we
know,
the
policies
were
taken
--
when
the
policies
were
taken
out.
they
were
solvent
here
as
presumably
in
the
stern
case
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
insolvent
at
any
time
that
any
premium
was
paid.
the
evidence
in
both
cases
is
that
the
estate
was
insufficient
to
meet
his
--
the
--
meet
the
liabilities,
the
estate
that
he
left,
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
insolvency
that's
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
we
can
prove
no
intention
to
deprive
creditors
or
no
voluntary
payment
by
him
while
he
was
insolvent.
but
as
i
say,
leaving
to
one
side
the
question
of
a
lien,
our
position
in
this
case
is
precisely
as
--
the
same
as
it
was
in
stern.
we
believe
that
there
is
nothing
inherent
in
life
insurance
that
makes
it
different
from
savings
deposit
of
a
third
party
contract
under
which
one
buys
something
for
another.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
retained
complete
control
over
the
disposition
of
this
property
until
the
time
he
died
and
unless
the
government
can
follow
this
material
--
these
payments
into
the
hands
of
the
beneficiary,
these
payments
will
--
would
be
taken
away
from
his
estate
and
turned
over
to
the
beneficiary.
but
the
existence
of
the
lien
in
this
case
provides
us
with
an
additional
argument
for
recovery
of
the
united
states.
now
of
course
the
attachment
of
a
lien
depends
in
the
first
instance
on
whether
or
not
there
was
property
or
rights
in
the
insured
to
which
the
liens
could
attach.
mr.
john
f.
davis
to
reach
both
the
proceeds.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
the
--
and
the
cash
surrender
value
of
both.
there
has
to
be
a
property
interest
in
the
--
in
the
insured
to
which
a
lien
can
attach
or
we
got
nowhere
with
the
lien
theory.
if
--
if
the
insured
had
no
--
had
no
interest
in
this
insurance
during
his
life
and
at
the
time
the
assessment
was
made,
then
there
was
nothing
for
the
lien
to
attach.
but
on
our
theory
of
the
case,
the
lien
attached
both
to
the
cash
surrender
value
which
he
could
have
drawn
down
and
to
his
interest
in
the
proceeds
which
he
had
a
complete
right
to
assign
and
up
until
the
moment
of
his
death.
i
think
my
point
is
made
clear
by
comparison
of
two
cases
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
first
of
these
cases
is
the
rowen
case
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made.
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
the
insured
did
have
a
property
interest
in
the
cash
surrender
value
but
that
state
law
prevented
there
being
liability
on
the
part
of
the
beneficiary
and
that
case
was
decided
i
think
in
1954.
then
in
1956,
the
same
court
had
before
it
the
case
of
united
states
against
behrens,
and
in
this
case,
a
lien
--
the
tax
had
been
assessed
before
the
insured's
death.
and
in
that
case,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
new
york
law
could
not
defeat
a
federal
lien
once
it
is
attached
and
in
that
case
they
held
the
beneficiary
liable
to
the
extent
of
the
cash
surrender
value
on
the
basis
--
on
the
ground
that
a
lien
had
attached
to
that
interest
of
the
--
of
the
insured.
a
similar
holding
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
in
united
states
against
hoper,
and
again
the
court
said
that
the
exemptions
or
the
provisions
of
the
particular
state
law
could
not
stand
up
when
a
lien
had
attached
to
the
interest
of
the
insured
and
the
property
had
passed
with
that
lien
to
the
beneficiary.
in
other
words,
these
courts
treat
the
lien
they
don't
have
to
go
into
a
question
of
transferee
liability
when
there
is
a
lien.
they
say
that
the
property
does
move
from
one
to
the
other
and
it
moves
subject
to
the
lien.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
both
cases
--
in
both
cases
only
to
the
cash
surrender
value
and
that's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that
the
--
there
has
to
be
a
property
interest
for
the
lien
to
attach.
and
if
on
the
other
hand
we
are
right
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
it
has
to
continue
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
property
interest
has
to
pass
over.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
know
in
this
case
that
--
well,
we
know
there
was
a
lien
on
his
property
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
rights.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
we
know
in
that
case,
the
--
the
law
is
quite
clear
as
to
when
--
how
a
lien
attaches
under
the
tax
law
and
there
has
to
be
an
assessment
and
notice
and
demand
and
then
the
lien
attaches
to
his
property
and
rights.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
those
things
did
not
take
place
in
rowen.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
in
stern,
why,
it
was
six
years
later
before
they
finally
managed
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
lien
doesn't
help
us
out
in
stern.
that
is
why
the
distinction,
that
distinction
i
have
pointed
out,
an
additional
ground
of
recovery
in
bess
that
we
didn't
have
in
--
in
stern.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
is
a
difference
of
question,
i
don't
know
that
it
--
the
differences
is
as
great
as
your
honor
would
imply.
i
--
it
seems
to
me
looking
at
the
question
of
state
law
and
federal
law
without
the
lien
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
there
to
be
any
equitable
even
collection
of
insurance
if
state
law
is
going
to
decide
the
questions
of
when
you
can
attach
liabilities.
i
think
i
may
have
suggested
in
my
argument
in
the
stern
case,
if
the
states
can
determine
this
question
of
liabilities,
there
is
no
reason
--
as
to
insurance,
there's
no
question
why
the
--
reason
they
couldn't
impose
their
own
question
on
liability
on
decedent's
estates,
say
as
to
any
property,
that
the
widow
shall
take
the
property
on
the
death
of
her
husband,
free
and
clear
of
the
death
of
her
husband.
and
certainly
as
far
as
the
state
lawyer
is
concerned
and
outside
of
the
federal
government's
concern
there
is
no
reason
why
a
state
shouldn't
say
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
that
--
that
is
right
but
this
is
a
question
as
to
what
shall
happen
at
the
time
of
death.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
state
--
the
state
laws
that
are
involved
by
and
large
provide
us
generally
that
when
a
debtor
transfers
his
property
when
he's
insolvent
that
a
creditor
can
follow
that
if
it's
done
without
consideration.
that's
--
that's
the
general
law
in
kentucky,
it's
the
general
law
in
new
jersey,
it's
the
general
law
anywhere.
but
i
speak
too
broadly
but
generally
it's
the
general
law.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
well
in
new
york,
in
new
york
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
true.
there
is
an
interest
in
the
insurance,
there
is
vested
interest
in
the
insurance
in
new
york
and
there
is
also
a
vested
interest
in
the
insurance
in
new
jersey,
which
however
is
subject
to
divestment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
the
right
to
take
unless
the
--
unless
the
insured
go
through
certain
forms
to
change
the
beneficiary.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
he
has
the
right
to
revoke
it
but
take
--
i
think
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
language
mr.
justice
black.
they
say
he
has
a
vested
right
which
is
subject
to
divestment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i
--
i
see
what
you
mean
and
i
think
--
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
there
is
a
property
interest
which
in
the
--
in
new
york
and
new
jersey.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
right
it
is
an
existing
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
property
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
important
but
it
is
not
determinative
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
because
they're
--
in
these
policies,
there
are
all
sorts
of
rights,
there's
a
right
to
possession,
there's
the
right
to
--
and
we
have
to
appraise
these
rights
and
see
whether
or
not
there
are
enough
rights
in
the
insured
which
pass
at
the
time
of
his
death
so
that
there
is
something
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'd
say
that's
--
that's
a
fair
question
and
my
answer
is
that
that
it
must
yield
in
this
--
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
really.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
must
--
it
must
if
there
has
to
be
an
equitable
method
of
collecting
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
income
taxes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
--
you
may
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
may
--
you
may
certainly
when
--
when
the
tax
law
impinges
upon
title,
but
when
it
comes
to
be
a
question
of
collection
the
federal
government
should
be
able
to
say
from
whom
you
can
collect
title
--
collect
taxes
and
questions
of
bad
title.
mr.
john
f.
davis
uncontrolling.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
and
i
think
that's
precisely
the
question
that
--
which
is
involved
when
this
court
determines
whether
or
not
an
estate
tax
can
impinge
upon
the
same
thing
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
would
be
--
this
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes
but
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
isn't
a
transfer
on
death
that
you
are
talking
about,
it's
a
transfer
which
took
place
at
the
time
they
took
out
the
insurance
and
therefore
the
argument
was
made
it
was
a
tax
on
the
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
think
mr.
justice
holmes
dealt
with
this
problem
of
the
title
rather
well.
he
in
--
in
a
case
pointed
out
that
i
think
carlos
against
bowers
in
281
that
refinements
of
title
with
respect
to,
and
he
was
talking
about
insurance
too,
are
not
--
are
not
important
to
the
tax
law.
it
is
the
actual
command
over
the
property
that
is
significant.
and
in
a
word
that's
our
position
here
that
it
isn't
the
refinements
of
title
as
to
--
as
to
this
property
that
that
controls
whether
or
not
there
is
a
property
interest
but
it
was
the
actual
command
of
the
property
that
is
significant.
mrs.
bess
seeks
to
meet
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
lien
in
two
ways.
first,
she
asserts
that
we
may
not
support
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
lien's
theory
since
we
did
not
argue
the
lien
theory
in
the
district
court.
i
submit
that
this
attempt
to
bar
the
argument
as
disputable.
it
is
well
accepted
that
a
lower
party
may
not
attack
a
judgment
below
on
a
new
ground.
it
may
on
an
appeal
support
a
judgment
on
any
ground
that
is
available.
we
argued
the
lien
theory
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
reserve
the
support
of
the
lien
theory
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
and
so
i
submit
that
it
is
proper
to
present
it
to
this
court.
the
second
argument
against
the
lien
theory
presented
by
mrs.
bess
is
that
no
lien
attached
in
this
case
because
the
taxpayer
did
not,
and
now
i
quote
from
the
statute,
“neglect
or
refuse
to
pay
his
taxes.”
and
the
reason
that
is
said
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
neglect
is
that
we
have
not
proved
that
the
taxpayer
was
careless
or
negligent
on
--
neglectful
in
failing
to
pay
his
taxes.
and
the
tax
--
and
mrs.
bess
would
read
that
element
into
the
end
of
the
law.
i
submit
that
there
word
"neglect"
in
the
sense
of
his
lien
means
to
fail
to
perform
a
duty
which
is
to
pay
a
debt
which
is
required
to
be
paid
rather
than
to
fail
to
pay
it
under
circumstances
of
negligence
or
carelessness.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
replying.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
the,
how
much
of
the
liability
in
this
case
was
covered
by
the
lien.
the
taxes
assessed
for
three
years
1945,
1946,
1947
the
lien
attaches
to
the
years
1945
and
1946
if
we
are
correct.
and
of
the
total
amount,
the
total
amount
of
the
three
years
was
$9000
and
$7900
of
that
would
be
in
the
two
years
to
which
the
lien
would
attach.
all
those
figures
are
given
on
pages
four
and
five
of
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
wasn't
quite
sure
whether
i
understood
which
way
judge
hand's
views
is
when
he
said
that
he
and
judge
medina
didn't
--
wouldn't
necessarily
go
along.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
couldn't
really
tell
which
way
--
which
way
his
mind
was
going
on
that
and
so
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
wasn't
going
to
refer
to
it.
i
do
want
to
go
back
for
just
a
minute
to
this
question
of
the
state
law
as
it
applies
to
the
interest
which
a
beneficiary
has
in
insurance
while
the
insured
is
still
alive.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
these
two
cases
which
have
been
argued
before
the
court
today,
the
law
of
kentucky
where
the
insurance
which
govern
the
law,
the
insurance
policies
in
the
stern
case,
holds
very
clearly
that
there
is
no
vested
right.
whereas
the
law
in
new
jersey
like
the
law
in
new
york
says
that
there
is
a
right
subject
to
divestment.
but
in
practical
effect
as
far
as
the
rights
of
beneficiaries
go,
i
can
find
no
difference
in
what
will
actually
happen
in
those
two,
in
those
two
states.
as
a
matter
of
refinements
of
title
if
you
please
rather
than,
rather
than
of
substance
insofar
as
any
question
before
this
court
present
time
is
concerned.
and
i
think
it
would
in
a
rather
extraordinary
thing
if
the
determination
of
liability
should
be
determined
to
be
different
in
these
two
states
because
of
the
way
they
describe
the
interest
of
the
beneficiary
in
these
life
insurance
policies.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
makes
a
difference
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
makes
a
difference
to
the
people
of
the
states
if
the
decisions
are
determined
on
that
basis,
but
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
know
unless
this
court
draws
the
distinction
in
this
case
and
makes
a
difference
in
the
tax
liability.
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
difference
in
the
actual
operative
facts
on
insurance
in
kentucky
and
new
jersey,
they
state
the
law
in
a
different
way
but
i
don't
know
of
any
difference
and
what
money
would
actually
be
received
by
beneficiaries,
under
different
circumstances.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
up
to
the
present
time
there
is
no
difference
because
the
states
take
care
of
it
through
their
--
through
their
exemption
statutes,
the
laws
as
to
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
so
unless
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
may
not
have
made
myself
entire
clear,
and
i
may
not
be
accurate,
but
insofar
as
i
could
search
the
laws
of
insurance
in
these
two
states,
unless
this
court
in
these
case
draws
this
difference
as
to
when
they
are
liable
for
the
income
taxes
of
the
insured,
the
--
the
law
is
actually
the
same
in
the
two
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
again
i
wasn't
precise
enough.
i
meant
to
say
that
the
law
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
vested
interest
in
the
circumstances
under
which
this
property
right
can
be
terminated
or
they
can
become
definite
are
the
same.
i'm
not
speaking
now
of
the
rights
of
creditors.
i'm
speaking
of
the
title,
the
refinements
of
title
arguments.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
has
been
no
effort
to
my
knowledge.
the
matter
has
been
in
litigation
at
the
present
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
maybe
--
it
maybe
dangerous
to
speculate
on
why
congress
hasn't
acted
in
matters.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
when
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
when
for
example
the
congress
acts
in
bankruptcy
law
with
respect
to
the
trustee
taking
the
insurance,
what
they're
doing
is
to
ameliorate
a
situation
which
would
exist
without
it,
i
mean,
they're
saying
that
the
insured
or
his
beneficiary
can
maintain
the
insurance
by
making
voluntary
payments.
they're
trying
to
--
they're
recognizing
that
this
is
an
asset
of
the
bankrupt,
which
the
trustee
can
get,
but
then
they
are
ameliorating
this
--
the
situation
so
as
to
protect
them.
now
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
the
life
insurance,
the
specific
inclusion
of
life
insurance
in
the
estate
tax.
here
we
had
a
situation
where
wealthy
people
were
putting
large
amounts
of
their
property
into
estates
and
congress
just
want
to
make
it
absolutely
clear,
that
with
respect
to
insurance,
if
the
insured
retained
the
instance
of
ownership
that
he
wouldn't
escaped
the
estate
tax.
i
mean
it
was
--
it
wasn't
that
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
have
been
necessary,
i'm
not
sure
that
property
by
itself
wouldn't
covered
it,
powers
that
are
involved,
but
it
was
--
congress
did
act
with
it
specifically
in
mind.
here,
until
we
--
until
get
this
problem
of
transferee
liability
we
don't
have
any
direct
impingement
of
insurance
on
income
tax
as
far
as
collections
goes,
i
mean
it's
a
by-law,
it's
a
by-pass.
we
--
we
deal
specifically
with
what
is
income
and
when
you
can
reach
it,
but
there
has
been
no
occasion
until
this
matter
of
transferee
liability
has
been
really
determined
for
them
to
create
affirmatively
with
the
rights
of
collection.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
would
except
where
the
lien
--
where
there
was
a
lien.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
you
have
no
lien,
why
then
you'd
have
to
have
some
common
law
theory.
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
--
yes.
in
the
bess
case,
you
don't
need
to
have
the
transferee
liability,
the
statute
of
elizabeth
or
any
fraudulent
conveyance
rule,
we
can
just
go
on
the
lien.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
congress
has
exempted
it
rather
than
giving
it,
the
hume
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
when
they
have
exempted
it
as
they
did
in
the
bankruptcy
sense
for
example,
they've
taken
affirmative
action
to
protect
this
right.
now
the
hume
case
is
of
course
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i'm
saying
in
the
absence
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
of
affirmative
action
by
congress
to
carve
this
property
right
out
of
its
other
rights,
that
it's
up
to
congress
to
decide.
i
--
i
think
that
there
is
a
real
public
interest
in
protecting
the
rights
of
widows
and
orphans.
but
i
think
its
for
congress
to
determine
if
they
want
to
exempt
what
i
would
--
what
i
am
arguing
would
be
the
otherwise
applicable
law
to
exempt
the
rights
of
widows
and
orphans
from
this
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
have
acted
to
exempt
it
in
other
cases
and
they
could
in
this
if
they
desired
to.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
right
to
follow
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
mean
in
private
debts,
and
just
a
creditor
following
it
against
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
know
of
no
case
where
a
private
creditor
has
been
able
to
collect
from
the
debtor,
but
i
take
it
this
is
because
the
state
laws
are
very
explicit
in
protecting
insurance
from
this
situation.
now
the
hume
case,
may
i
say
is
a
case
of
a
private
creditor
going
after
transferee
of
his
debtor,
and
i
think
the
case
is
not
directly
in
point
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
indication
that
in
this
case
there
were
any
other
rights
of
ownership
retained
by
the
insured,
as
far
as
i
know,
this
was
a
policy
where
it
was
made
out
and
finally
vested
with
no
right
of
changing
the
beneficiary,
no
right
to
drop
it,
so
that
it
was
given
at
the
time
the
insurance
policy
was
taken
out
and
the
premiums
paid.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
know
that
that's
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
suppose
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
would
have
the
same
rights
as
a
creditor
would
have
in
following
it
to
a
transferee
liability.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
think
a
trustee
--
i
think
a
trustee
in
new
york
would
not
be
able
to
follow
assets
into
the
hands
of
a
transferee,
i
don't
think
that
even
under
the
bankruptcy
law
as
it
stands
it
could,
i
think
that
what
he
can
do
is
to
vest
the
rights
of
a
living
insured,
he
can
take
possession
of
those
as
a
power
which
he
has
a
right.
but
even
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
even
then
congress
has
said
that
they
shall
recognize
the
state
exemptions,
so
that
whether
our
state
exemptions
with
the
--
he
is
--
congress
has
again
made
specific
provision
to
protect
the
beneficiaries
in
this
case.
and
really
the
heart
of
my
argument
is,
if
congress
wants
to
protect
beneficiaries
in
these
cases,
if
it
feels
there
is
a
public
policy,
congress
can
do
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
order
to
protect
them
we
have
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
or
the
--
or
as
i
state
the
trust
fund
doctrine,
yes,
that's
-
that
is
true.
mr.
john
f.
davis
unless
there's
a
lien.
