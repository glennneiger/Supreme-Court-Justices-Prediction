but
do
you
know
whether
you've
got
a
lien
or
not,
except
retrospective?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
take
rowen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
of
those
things
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
they
weren't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
lien
thing
doesn't
help
you
out,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
pretty
decisive,
in
fact
decisive,
a
pretty
big
difference,
isn't
it?
that
you
can't
displace
the
lien
of
the
government
by
any
local
property
law
as
against
a
--
retrospectively
a
lien
comes
into
being
and
there
do
you
have
a
property
right
which
displaces
a
state
property
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
surely
it
must
(inaudible)
a
reasonable
difference
between
a
state
law
which
has
been
alive
all
the
time
and
a
direction
that
the
state
should
prevail
under
the
collision
at
the
time
of
death,
so
they're
not
the
same
things
to
my
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
there
are
antecedent
interests
created
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
beneficiary,
the
wife.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
new
york
it's
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
new
york
it's
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
means
that
--
which
means
that
the
wife
has
an
inchoate
right
all
along
which
is
like
the
thing
that
i
suggested
about
new
york
law
that
the
contingent
remain,
the
man
has
a
real
interest
which
constitutionally
can't
be
abrogated
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
there's
more
than
that
--
it's
a
little
more
than
language
mr.
davis
if
i
am
right
in
the
analogy.
for
instance,
the
legislature
of
new
york
couldn't
terminate
that
interest
with
some
so-called
public
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
--
as
a
matter
of
fair
due
process
(voice
overlap)
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
pretty
important
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that
is
important
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
revert
to
stern,
is
it
fair
to
say
--
well,
if
that
right
was
used,
would
you
clearly
recognize,
say
in
new
york,
whether
that
right
tend
to
displace
on
the
basis
of
general
law
taking
out
of
the
ruling
on
his
presence,
whether
--
whether
that
state
law
must
yield
to
the
general
law
for
which
congress
has
made
no
provision.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
say
"must",
that's
a
big
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that
that
you
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
have
one.
that
you
should
have
one
thing
in
new
york,
another
in
utah
or
iowa?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would,
i
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
intellectually
i
stopped
you
in
my
mind
when
you
said
when
the
federal
government
comes
to
collect,
as
you
see
it,
that
point,
there's
a
difference
that
this
is
merely
a
way
of
cashing
or
collecting
because
in
the
process
of
collecting
you're
impinging
on
something
which
the
state
of
new
york
has
created
with
a
real
substantial
value.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
practical?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
the
estate
transferred
--
a
estate
tax
on
transfer
is
a
general
embracing
principle
that
the
transfer
takes
place
when
the
--
when
the
grantor,
the
creator
of
the
interest
dies,
that
that's
the
thread
which
is
cut.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
are
you
moving
on
from
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this.
before
the
stipulation
to
which
you
referred
had
been
embodied
in
the
very
terms
of
the
stipulation
and
therefrom
from
the
facts
of
the
allegations
and
stipulations
the
government
have
said,
wherefore
we
are
entitled,
wherefore
we
claim
a
lien,
just
a
conclusion
of
that,
suppose
that,
could
you
assail
that
with
a
wherefore
--
would
the
wherefore
be
subject
to
a
logical
attack?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
i
understood
you.
you
said
that
it
could
be
attacked
if
on
the
stipulation
there
is
an
“a
wherefore”
clause,
you
said
the
wherefore
wouldn't
follow,
did
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
meant
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
made
the
complaint
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
--
i
want
to
be
the
--
as
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
complaint
just
embodied
what
is
now
the
stipulation
and
the
government
said
wherefore
we
have
a
lien
and
want
the
execution
of
it,
would
that
have
been
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
would
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
wherefore,
because
of
the
antecedent
fact
justifying
the
wherefore?
and
now
i'm
asking
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
way
you
escaped
from
or
rather
that's
the
basis
on
which
you
say
that
the
document
mr.
davis
invoked
that
a
judgment
--
a
judgment
can
be
supported
by
anything
that
supports
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
isn't
supporting
your
judgment,
is
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
is
the
answer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
his
claim
that
he
can
sustain
a
judgment
on
any
theory
that
legally
can
sustain
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what
--
on
what
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well
he
must
--
there
must
have
been
some
indebtedness
incurred.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
obligation,
an
assessment
not
paid
by
him,
and
he
got
this
outstanding
power
before
him
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
change
of
beneficiary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
say
you
make
us
the
beneficiary,
so
that's
in
your
control.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
under
no
such
difficulty,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
makes
a
lot
of
difference,
the
people
of
different
states,
so
it
can't
be
just
a
matter
of
nicety
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
then
say
nicety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
say
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
must
be
an
intrinsic
difference
because
the
outcomes
of
different
people
are
different
in
different
states.
now,
what
you
say
are
the
same
actuality,
and
therefore
not
in
concept
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
perhaps
--
but
what
can
happen
to
the
beneficiaries
as
of
new
jersey
and
the
(inaudible)
the
statement
says
new
york
law,
the
state
--
of
new
york
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
difference
which
you
say
is
an
immaterial
difference
in
result
which
each
get
to
say,
that
isn't
true
as
to
what
may
happen
to
that
people
in
the
--
beneficiaries
under
the
policy
if
a
creditor
and
once
they
can
go
after,
the
other
he
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
problem.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
the
legislature
have
seen
fit
to
correct
or
mitigate
or
call
it
what
you
will
the
local
common
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
--
then
you
don't
have
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
go
back
to
our
lady
elizabeth,
if
that's
so.
then
you
can
say,
well
then
why
don't
you
argue,
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
you're
on
though,
because
the
state
law
is
the
same.
legislatively
obtained
or
common
lawly
obtained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
am
i
right
or
wrong
in
having
the
impression
not
knowledge
that
if
this
--
if
this
same
situation
arose
with
the
bankruptcy
field,
the
--
following
the
assets
of
the
creditor
--
or
in
that
to
the
debtor
into
the
common
creditor
pocket,
cash
could
not
apply
(inaudible)
congress
by
a
statute
of
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
weren't
this
--
this
statute
of
elizabeth
would
as
a
matter
of
course
have
enabled
the
trustee
to
get
a
hold
of
an
insurance
policy
like
this
in
bankruptcy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
under
the
bankruptcy
act
except
insofar
as
congress
has
specifically
dealt
with
it,
would
a
new
york
trustee
be
able
to
get
after
the
insurance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
should
think
there
is
--
there
is
a
--
if
the
answer
is
no
and
i
don't
know,
i'm
asking
you,
there's
also
a
public
interest
there,
isn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
common
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
order
to
protect
them
however
you
have
to
engraft
how
far
into
tax
law
(inaudible)
that's
true
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
--
in
order
to
enable
the
government,
to
go
to
this
insurance
money,
you
have
to
engraft
upon
the
present
procedural
provision
of
the
tax
law,
the
statute
of
elizabeth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct.
you
haven't
surrendered
anything.
