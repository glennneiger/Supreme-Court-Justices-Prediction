mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
--
what
i
was
saying
at
adjournment
yesterday
afternoon,
northern
pacific
land
grant
amounted
to
approximately
39
and
a
half
million
acres.
all
of
this
acreage
has
at
all
times
been
for
sale
and
as
fast
as
the
sentence
could
be
induced
to
the
company
and
as
purchasers
could
be
found,
the
land
had
been
sold.
so
that
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
in
may,
1949,
the
company
had
sold
all
but
approximately
2,700,000
acres.
in
the
sales
of
these
lands,
the
traffic
clauses
were
ever
used
where
the
lands
were
agriculture
in
character
or
were
grazing
lands.
but
in
the
case
of
lands
which
were
valuable
solely
for
their
natural
resources
such
as
timber,
minerals,
coal
and
iron
and
the
like.
traffic
clauses
were
used
from
the
beginning
of
the
character
that
i
have
explained.
because
those
natural
resources
had
a
special
value
to
the
northern
pacific
and
not
to
obtainable
market
price
and
that
northern
pacific
have
a
transportation
agency.
it
had
railroad
to
transport
these
commodities
to
market
to
resume
the
transportation
business.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
the
northwestern
improvement
is
wholly
on
subsidiary.
originally
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
new
jersey
and
later
transferred
to
delaware,
it's
organized
as
a
new
jersey
corporation
in
1897
to
takeover
lands
that
were
subject
to
missouri
division
mortgage
of
the
old
company
in
order
to
keep
them
up
to
(inaudible).
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
no,
your
honor,
relatively
small
proportion
of
the
lands
are
in
ownership
of
the
improvement
company.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
the
improvement
company
took
over
only
these
lands
that
were
subject
to
the
missouri
division
mortgage.
those
were
in
--
principally
in
north
dakota
and
they're
practically
old
and
sold
to
agricultural
lands.
very
little
remained
in
northwestern
improvement
company
ownership
although
i
think
the
improvement
company
did
have
some
timberlands
in
montana.
and
as
i've
stated
to
yesterday,
the
improvement
company
has
at
all
times
has
been
treated
as
the
department
of
the
railroad.
the
land
department
of
the
railroad
is
the
land
department
of
the
improvement
company.
and
this
--
well
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record,
we
are
now
in
the
process
of
dissolving
the
improvement
company.
of
the
lands
that
had
been
sold,
only
2,144,000
acres
were
timberlands
subject
to
traffic
clauses
and
all
but
about
218,000
acres
of
that
2,144,000
were
sold
prior
to
1910,
900,000
acres
were
sold
to
warehouses
in
1900
and
the
traffic
clauses
in
that
contract
expired
in
1915.
the
railway
company
as
i
say
had
an
interest
in
land
--
in
the
natural
resources
and
when
the
lands
containing
coal
or
iron
which
i
might
say
were
included
in
the
grant
were
sold.
generally,
the
minerals
were
accepted
and
reserved
to
the
company.
if
other
minerals
were
suspected
to
be
present,
a
reservation
of
minerals
is
also
made
so
that
in
1949,
the
railway
company
had
about
--
had
mineral
rates
in
about
six
and
a
half
million
acres
of
land.
in
all
leases
of
it
are
mineral
rights
or
timberlands
or
cutting
timber
or
for
removal
of
natural
resources.
they
have
included
the
traffic
clause
providing
that
the
lessee
with
ship
products
over
our
line
upon
which
were
equal
to
those
of
any
competitors
and
when
the
destination
to
be
reached
by
our
land.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
no,
your
honor.
they
are
very
general
among
railroads.
they
have
been
used
for
75
years
i
would
say.
there
are
quite
a
number
of
cases
of
the
books,
where
the
reasonableness
or
the
validity
of
traffic
clauses
of
this
character
had
been
before
the
court.
only
a
few
have
involved
to
questions
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
they
have
been
uniformly
upheld
to
deal
with
as
against
to
numerous
different
charges
of
objection
that
has
been
made
to.
i
say
uniformly
in
the
revenue
case
in
this
court
about
253
u.s.,
two
types
of
the
traffic
clauses
were
involved.
one
where
the
(inaudible)
have
leased
a
shipper's
railroad
from
the
shipper
serving
the
shipper's
coal
mine.
and
the
lease
contained
the
provision
that
the
shipper
would
ship
three
fourths
of
his
coal
over
the
leased
line
and
the
line
of
(inaudible).
the
court
said
that
the
claim
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act
was
too
insubstantial
to
be
considered.
other
traffic
clauses
involved
in
that
case
were
found
to
be
a
part
of
the
scheme
for
the
monopolization
of
the
coal
of
the
school
fields
in
pennsylvania
and
its
transportation
to
markets,
and
were
condemned
as
being
a
part
of
that
scheme
of
monopolization.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
only
if
they
can't
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes
that's
in
everyone.
i
should
say
the
words
“and
service”
is
not
included
in
grazing
leases,
it's
included
in
our
timber
contract
or
timber
cutting
contract.
but
the
administration
has
at
all
time
recognized
that
we
couldn't
expect
the
shipping
business
unless
we
can
provide
them
good
service
as
to
our
competitor.
and
i
say
that
the
word
“rates
being
equal”
implies
service
equality
because
unless
the
services
are
the
same,
you
can't
compare
the
rates.
for
example,
frequently,
there
may
be
transit
privilege
that
connects
with
the
rate
over
one
line
that
isn't
available
by
another
to
stop
privilege
that
to
has
appearing
on
measure
of
the
rate
even
though
the
rate
itself
may
be
the
same
number
since
per
hundred
pounds.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
if
we
can
transport
it
in
the
direction
of
movement,
if
it
can
be
reached
by
a
connection,
then
we're
entitled
to
the
whole
as
far
we
can
hold.
if
he
is
shipping
in
a
different
direction
he
doesn't
need
to
use
our
lines.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i'm
not
exactly
clear
as
to
what
sort
of
a
provision
the
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
think
not
necessarily,
but
i
think
probably
he
will
get
in
trouble
with
section
3
of
the
clayton
act.
now
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
is
different
from
section
1
of
sherman
act
and
that
all
that
needs
to
be
shown
is
a
potential
lessening
of
competition
or
a
potential
tendency
to
monopoly,
whereas,
the
restraints
of
the
sherman
act
are
unlawful
only
if
they're
unreasonable
and
they
are
unreasonable
only
if
they
have
actual
harmful
effects
on
competition
to
the
detriment
result.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
substantial
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
on
this
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
we
think
there's
no
effect,
no
substantial
effect
on
competition
from
this
traffic
clause.
because
in
the
first
place,
our
rates
have
to
be
published
and
filed
therein,
open
to
all
shippers
the
same
--
on
the
same
commodity
between
the
same
points
for
everybody
and
subject
to
change
only
on
30
days
notice.
we
are
in
competition
in
courts
for
the
commodities
of
all
other
shippers
from
the
same
shipping
point,
and
the
--
it
is
observed
to
suppose
that
either
our
competitors
or
our
self
would
disregard
the
business
of
other
shippers
because
we
have
clauses
that
gave
us
priority
on
the
particular
--
of
the
business
with
particular
shipper.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes
and
they
frequently
do.
they
ship
by
truck,
even
though
they
may
pay
a
higher
rate
but
the
service
is
better
and
it's
more
economical
to
them
and
we
recognize
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
think
not.
i
think
it
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
non-enforcement
on
our
part
with
a
continuing
potential
for
enforcement
but
it
is
the
practical
construction
over
a
long
period
of
years,
down
to
all
the
shippers
of
our
territory
who
were
subject
to
these
traffic
clause.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
if
he
--
if
he
prefers
we
have
the
line
because
of
friendship
or
reciprocity.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
a
preference?
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
he
is
obliged
by
this
clause
to
ship
over
our
line.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
he
has
agreed
to
give
us
the
preference.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
he
--
of
course
in
dealing
with
that
and
given
these
agreements,
he
does
give
up
his
freedom
of
choice
to
that
extent,
that
where
--
where
the
choice
depends
only
on
considerations
of
friendship
or
reciprocity
and
solicitation
where
it
depends
only
on
those
things.
he
has
agreed
to
prefer
us.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
he's
not
probably
preferred
us
to
service
the
competitors
better
or
if
their
rates
are
lower
as
they
often
are.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
we
think
he
is
free
to
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
to
accept
that
service.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
is
it
binding?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
because
i
think
that
makes
a
competitor's
rate
more
favorable.
for
example,
some
of
the
shippers
testified
that
by
shipping
over
to
milwaukee,
they
--
shipping
livestock
over
to
milwaukee
and
they
could
make
better
time
and
avoid
one
stop
for
feed
and
rest
or
unload.
they
ship
over
our
line
while
they
have
to
unload,
to
feed
or
rest
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
--
additional
time.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well
i
think
it's
a
practical
construction.
but
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
there
are
thousands
of
these
leases
or
contracts,
many
of
them,
a
great
many
of
them
expressly
say,
rates,
services
and
facility
fee
or
rates
and
service
fee
and
the
court
below
treated
them
all
alike,
he
enjoined
all
of
them
and
made
no
difference
whether
the
term
services
and
facility
to
them
or
not.
and
i
say
that
if
there
is
a
distinction,
the
case
should
go
back
to
trial
on
the
merit.
now,
i
say,
we
have
no
intention
of
making
a
distinction.
it's
just
a
matter
of
craftsmanship
i
suppose
drew
up
the
timber
contract
in
the
first
place
since
we
forgot
to
put
in
the
word
and
services.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
think
also
myself,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
think
it's
important
that
the
service
is
just
as
important
as
the
rates.
and
it
is
not
our
intention
to
require
the
shippers
who
use
our
line
unless
it's
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
which
he
uses.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
these
clauses
require
us
to
remain
to
be
always
competitive
with
our
competitors
if
we
want
to
get
the
business
of
our
lessee.
now
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
shippers
who
are
subject
to
this
clauses
are
relatively
few,
i
think.
each
ship
is
important.
there
is
much
other
traffic
that
is
identical
that
is
competitive
that
to
--
we
must
maintain
rates
and
service
for,
so
much
to
our
competitor
and
i
say
that
the
sherman
act
is
concerned
only
with
competition
as
in
effect
to
public.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
your
decisions
go
that
far.
i
think
that
the
restraints
are
--
have
been
held
to
be
per
se
unreasonable
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
as
to
the
actual
effect
only
if
they
fix
prices,
represent
boycotts
or
exclude
competitors
from
the
substantial
bargain.
now
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor's
point.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
don't
think
it
does
any
more
so
than
if
we
are
able
by
solicitation
to
get
the
business
and
shipment.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
i
think
this
is
solicitation.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
and
i
don't
think
the
public
is
much
concerned
with
solicitation.
i
think
the
sherman
act
is
not
quite
concerned
with
whether
we
get
the
business
of
a
particular
shipper
or
our
competitor
so
long
as
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
no
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
the
sherman
act
goes
that
far.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
a
number
of
them
are
cited
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
on
page
186
of
the
record.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
say
not
allowed
to
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
no.
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
i
say
that
the
testimony
of
our
land
commissioner
the
deposition
of
17
the
grazing
lessees
all
show
that
that's
the
way
it
could
interpret
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you,
and
i
would
say
this
that
i
put
that
object
to
consent
decree
of
joining
us
from
using
this
clause
unless
we
put
in
the
word
services
and
facilities.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
even
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
your
honor,
we
don't
sue
shippers
very
often.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
our
people
who
testified
that
the
main
value
of
it
is
the
assistance
to
the
solicitor
that
matters
agree.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
i
wanted
to
argue
that
point,
your
honor
but
i
think
my
time
has
expired.
we
disagree
sharply
on
whether
mere
ownership
of
land
and
just
to
ownership
of
the
piece
of
land
with
monopolistic
result.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
is
entirely
wrong.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
because
the
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
your
honor,
aren't
we
entitled
to
go
out
and
make
contract
to
shippers
for
one
transportation
or
have
the
transportation?
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
of
the
great
western
case
in
this
court.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
interstate
commerce
commission
against
great
western
railroad.
the
rock
island
railroads
--
no
the
great
western
railroad
put
on
a
reduce
rate,
a
published
rate
for
the
shippers
of
packing
house
products
in
missouri
river
markets.
and
in
consideration
of
the
great
western
publishing
that
reduced
rate,
the
packers
agreed
to
give
the
great
western
three
fourths
of
all
their
business.
and
it
was
enforced
to
this
court.
it
was
attacked
and
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
this
court
said,
railroads
are
free
to
have
a
business
the
same
as
others
and
the
big
contracts
looking
into
the
entries
of
their
business.

mr.

that

your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman

it
was
not
as
--
it
was
not
an
enforcement
of
the

it
was
a
proceeding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
where
the
question
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act
was
involved.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
no,
it
was
not
an
enforcement
proceeding
either
by
a
judge
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
have
to
say
the
case
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
we
have
enforcement
to
--
of
such
contract
against
st.paul
and
tacoma
lumber
company.
it
is
cited
in
here,
decision
by
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
i
might
say
this,
your
honor,
while
we
were
using
these
traffic
clauses,
the
(inaudible)
railway
built
west
to
the
pacific
coast
in
1893.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
milwaukee
built
west
in
1907.
the
panama
canal
was
opened,
the
ship
line
operated
through
the
canal,
highways
come
in,
truck
lines,
the
contract
carriers
--
common
carrier,
motor
trucks,
private
carriers
on
the
highways
has
come
in
to
the
pacific.
it's
a
pretty
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
think
it's
rather
indicative
of
the
fact
that
our
clauses
have
not
suppressed
competition.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
well,
your
honor,
37
million
acres
of
this
land
has
been
sold
and
almost
all
of
it
without
any
traffic
clauses.
what
we
have
left
are
scattered
remnants
and
only
part
of
those
were
subject
to
traffic
clauses.
now
the
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
--
the
grazing
land
--
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
the
grazing
lands
are
open
at
all
times
to
sale
without
a
traffic
clause.
we
only
lease
them
pending
sale
and
we
only
put
the
traffic
clause
in
lease.
we
don't
put
it
in
the
--
in
the
contract
--
in
the
sales.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
that's
it,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
that's
exactly
the
point.
the
question
is
whether
the
summary
judgment
was
properly
granted.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
that's
exactly
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
proof
of
compulsion
that
they
entered
into
this
contract.
mr.
m.l.
countryman
jr.
suppose
the
situation
is
the
other
way,
your
honor
and
we're
out
trying
to
sell
our
land
to
purchasers
or
to
lease
it
to,
he's
not
coming
to
us,
we
are
trying
to
sell
it
to
him.
and
that
is
a
question
of
fact
in
the
court.
