mr.

l.
countryman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
summary
judgement
entered
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington
without
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
perpetually
enjoined
the
appellants
from
enforcing
or
using
so-called
traffic
clauses.
mr.
m.
l.

so-called
traffic
clauses
which
i
will
claim
in
their
contracts
for
the
sale
or
lease
of
lands.
mr.

clauses.
mr.

l.

traffic
clauses.
traffic
provisions,
perhaps,
i
should
say,
on
the
ground
that
the
--
are
per
se
unreasonable
restraints
of
trade
and
commerce
and
the
transportation
of
properties
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
traffic
clauses
in
question
are
covenants
or
agreements
contained
in
--
in
contract
sale
and
leases
of
land
by
which
the
purchaser
or
a
lessee
agrees.
that
rates
being
equal
and
that
he
has
(inaudible)
rates
and
services
being
equal.
he
will
give
the
northern
pacific
railway
his
business
in
an
attempt
to
pay
his
product
when
its
line
maybe
used
to
reach
the
destination
of
recipient.
mr.
m.
l.
countryman,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it's
a
part
of
the
consideration,
the
railway
company
gets
for
making
the
contract
or
lease
to
the
purchaser
or
lessee
of
its
land,
that
it
shall
enjoin
the
transportation
of
the
products.
provided,
it
can
hold
to
the
destination
he
wishes
to
reach
and
provided
also
that
the
rates
are
equal
to
those
of
any
competitors
as
of
many
instances,
if
rates
and
services
are
equal
to
any
competitor.
now,
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
even
though
the
work
and
services
may
not
have
been
included
in
many
of
this
contracts,
the
administration
over
a
period
of
years
that
is
during
the
entire
period
as
used
to
this
clauses,
which
i
might
say
goes
back
to
1887,
has
been
to
apply
a
rule
of
reason
and
not
to
expect
the
business
unless
it
was
convened,
the
shipper
to
use
the
railroad
of
northern
pacific.
now,
the
--
the
judgement
was
not
based
on
any
evidence
that
these
traffic
clauses
had
actually
resulted
in
harm
in
competition
or
detriment
of
any
kind
to
producers
or
consumers
of
transportation
services
or
to
the
lessees
or
purchasers
of
northern
pacific
lines
themselves.
it
was
based
upon
the
view
of
the
district
court
that
on
the
admitted
facts
established
by
the
pleadings
and
by
responses
to
request
for
admission,
certain
stipulation
of
the
fact
and
the
depositions
that
were
taken
on
behalf
of
the
appellants.
the
case
came
squarely
within
a
formula
derived
from
the
so-called
tying
cases,
which
the
district
court
state
is
as
false.
mr.
m.
l.
countryman,
jr.

page
187
of
the
record.
when
one,
a
seller
or
lessor
enjoying
market
control
of
a
particular
commodity
in
contracts
for
the
sale
or
lease
of
such
commodity
requires
a
buyer
or
a
lessee
to
purchase
a
distinctive
difference
in
separate
commodity.
and
second,
the
amount
of
interstate
commerce
in
the
tied
commodity
is
not
insignificant
or
insubstantial.
the
tying
arrangement
is
illegal
per
se
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
before
discussing
the
court's
decision
arising
at
the
conclusion
of
the
facts
in
this
case
brought
up
within
the
formula
stated,
i
should
like
to
state
briefly
the
undisputed
fact
to
their
establishment.
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
is
a
common
carrier,
railroad
corporation
which
is
the
successor
to
railroad
and
plan
event
of
a
federal
corporation
of
substantially
the
same
name
created
by
the
act
of
july
2,
1864.
northwestern
improvement
company
is
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
northern
pacific
which
was
organized
for
the
purpose
of
taking
over
a
portion
of
the
land,
granted
lands,
which
the
railway
company
acquired
from
the
predecessors
in
order
to
keep
them
out
under
the
mortgages
of
the
railway
company.
and
also
to
engage
in
the
operation
of
certain
coal
mines
supplying
the
railway
company
with
coal.
it
has
at
all
times
been
operated
as
the
department
of
the
railway
company.
the
land
department
of
the
railway
company
can
be
also
the
land
department
of
northwestern
improvement
company.
now,
the
--
the
land
grants
to
which
northern
pacific
succeeded,
consisted
of
each
(inaudible)
section
to
a
distance
of
20
miles
on
each
side
of
the
line
where
it
passed
through
states
and
40
miles
on
each
side
of
the
line
where
it
passed
to
--
to
a
territory
with
a
right
to
take
indemnity
land
into
indemnity
belt
each
10
miles
beyond
the
limit
of
the
place
(inaudible).
the
railroad
of
the
northern
pacific
was
built
pursuant
to
the
offer
of
this
land
grant
and
it
was
constructed
through
the
northern
states
from
the
kevin's
lake
superior
to
fuse
itself.
the
purpose
of
the
traffic
act,
the
purpose
of
construction
of
the
railroad
was
to
provide
transportation
facility
to
what
was
then
the
language
of
this
court,
hopeless
prairie,
trackless
forest
and
unexplored
mountains.
it
was
able
to
develop
the
territory
and
its
settlement
and
to
provide
transportation
for
the
product
of
these
lands
and
the
government's
(inaudible)
land.
as
a
result
of
the
land
grant,
the
railroad
company
and
the
railway
company
of
the
successor
received
approximately
39
and
a
half
million
acres
of
land.
