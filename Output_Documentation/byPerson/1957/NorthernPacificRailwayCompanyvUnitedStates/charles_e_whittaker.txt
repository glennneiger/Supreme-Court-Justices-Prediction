whittaker
he,
of
course,
the
shipper
would
have
the
right
to
route
to
destination
from
your
terminal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
ask
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
countryman,
i
--
from
my
understanding
of
the
principle
points
you
argue
in
the
brief
which
you
haven't
here
discussed
at
all,
deals
with
the
basis
upon
which
the
trial
court
rested
its
decision.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
namely,
that
as
the
government
here
concedes
apparently
by
its
brief,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
monopoly
by
your
railroad
or
the
land
market.
and
the
trial
court
said
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
was
not
necessary
to
show
that
you
did
have
any
monopoly
of
the
land
market,
it
was
enough
alone
that
title
to
the
particular
piece
of
real
estate
was
invested
in
fee
in
the
railroad.
now
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
one
--
one
section
of
land,
the
court
said
--
the
trial
court
said,
if
the
railroad
has
titled
to
that
we're
not
concerned
with
any
monopoly
in
any
market
of
land.
but
it
is
enough
if
he
own
--
that
the
railroad
owns
title
to
the
one
piece
of
real
estate,
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
decision,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
you
insist
upon
trial
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
contract
or
combination
or
conspiracy
that
was
strange
trade
in
this
market,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
trial
court
didn't
place
it
upon
--
he
said
that
the
government
was
entitled
to
the
judgment
it
received
simply
upon
a
finding
that
you
had
the
simple
title
to
a
particular
section
of
land,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
friedman,
is
there
any
finding
by
the
court
below
that
the
northern
pacific
did
have
any
monopoly
on
the
real
estate
market
or
in
that
area?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
monopoly
in
the
market.
didn't
the
court
simply
say
that
that
wasn't
essential
to
his
conclusion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
sherman
act
case,
there
has
to
be
some
monopolization
of
the
market
that
restraints
competition?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
what
the
times-picayune
case
held,
the
dupont
case
recently?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
though,
isn't
that
a
factual
situation
and
has
--
as
to
whether
or
not
the
northern
pacific
did
have
such
control
over
the
market
as
to
be
able
to
restrain
commerce
and
isn't
that
an
issue
of
fact
which
they
wanted
to
try
but
didn't
get
an
opportunity
to
try
in
the
court
below?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
it
is
actually
in
minnesota,
dakota,
montana,
is
it
not?
do
you
know?
