justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
binds
the
shipper
to
select
you
rather
than
some
competitor
of
yours
whose
rates
maybe
the
same
but
whose
service
condition
maybe
different,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
--
this
bars
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
clause
bar
such
choice
by
the
shipper,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
understand
then
what
you
got
if
its
--
if
the
shipper
have
a
--
i'm
afraid
i'm
sure
i
miss
--
i
misapprehend
you.
you
say
that
the
shipper
is
not
bound
to
select
this
land
area.
this
shipper
is
not
bound
to
select
you
although
from
the
point
of
view
of
service
he
may
prefer
another
line,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
service
preference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
understand
it.
so
why
isn't
--
isn't
competition
seriously
or
substantially
restrained
in
that
regard
that
the
shipper
has
no
choice
by
virtue
of
this
clause.
and
therefore
his
freedom
of
--
of
selecting
a
competitor
if
the
order
is
cut
off,
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
is
not
bound
to
prefer
you
if
he
preferred
the
services
of
the
other
competitors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
rates,
yes,
but
where
--
where
is
he
free
to
prefer
a
competitor
of
yours
who
--
which
i
suppose
i
would
say,
which
although
it
charges
the
same
rates,
gives
more
--
gives
a
preferable
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
is
free?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
what
--
doesn't
this
clause
bind
him
against
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what's
the
basis
for
your
saying
that,
although
the
rates
maybe
the
same
over
the
same
distance,
the
shipper
thinks
there
are
service
advantages
in
shipping
over
a
competitor
of
yours,
why
is
he
free
to
do
that
in
view
of
this
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
this
your
construction
or
is
that
is
what
you
say
without
questioning
it
binding
on
us
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
that
--
is
that
construction,
is
the
government
agree
to
your
construction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
very
important
in
transportation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
very
important
mr.
countryman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
go
on.
i
just
want
to
where
that
clause.
where
is
--
where
is
the
clause
in
the
record,
the
exact
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
question
basing
on
186.
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
all
shipments
of
livestock
et
cetera,
whenever
its
freight
rates
do
not
exceed
the
rates
of
the
line.
as
i
understood
you
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
did,
you
said
two
things.
in
the
first
place,
that
if
a
shipper
as
a
mere
(inaudible)
out
of
his
own
physical
relations
with
officers
of
the
milwaukee
prefers
to
ship
over
to
milwaukee.
not
a
penny
advantage
in
his
pocket
but
he
just
likes
those
officers
--
you
say
under
this
clause
he
is
allowed
to
do
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
allowed.
well,
now
(inaudible)
--
i
notice
their
difference,
is
this
freight
rates
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can't
say,
i
prefer
to
ship
over
the
milwaukee
although
the
rates
are
the
same,
can
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now
the
next
question,
suppose
the
services
--
suppose
he
thinks
that
milwaukee
is
faster
or
allows
him
more
of
a
stop
or
one
of
the
other
innumerable
elements
that
make
up
services
that
that's
a
more
advantageous
thing
for
him
from
his
point
of
view
under
the
grazing
leads,
that
is
not
included
as
a
rate,
is
it?
so
you
say
practically
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
put
this
to
you
mr.
countryman,
that
unless
this
is
an
absolutely
clear
industry
construction
at
all
events
you
will
be
puzzled
and
at
all
event,
there
will
be
--
maybe
a
litigious
question
there
whether
the
service
does
include
rates
and
to
that
extent,
the
shipper
is
constrained,
you
say
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
public.
but
i
like
to
put
it
to
you,
if
i
may,
that
the
shipper
is
part
of
the
public.
you
can't
say
--
when
we
say
restrained
competition
as
against
disadvantageously
to
the
public,
you
can't
antithesis
the
outside
public
and
the
class
of
shippers
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
why
is
that
the
basis
of
the
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
that
make
suppose
it
wasn't
a
land,
suppose
this
is
a
contract
unrelated
to
the
land
relation
of
the
--
of
the
railroad,
and
they
just
got
out
of
the
goodness
of
their
heart
for
self
interest,
makes
such
an
agreement,
would
that
be
alright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whereby
the
shipper
binds
himself
not
to
use
a
rival
--
a
competing
railroad?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
that
case,
mr.
countryman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
that
came
up,
in
the
sherman
or
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
209
108?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
any
authority
to
involve
sherman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
you
--
it's
your
understanding
that
the
construction
of
sherman
law
applicable
that
is
to
the
railroads
arrangements,
that
is
the
shipper
of
consideration
that
he
deem
appropriate,
i
don't
care
what
it
is.
for
the
next
two
years
bind
himself
because
railroad
x
assures
him
that
they
will
always
have
cut.
that
he
can
make
an
agreement
that
for
the
next
two
years
he
will
never
use
any
competing
service.
you
think
that's
alright
under
the
sherman
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
it.
i'm
a
little
surprised.
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
not
on
that
abstract
proposition
but
because
you
have
the
simple
title
and
therefore
could
dispose
of
the
transfer
of
that
title
and
made
the
condition
of
transfer
on
getting
the
business
that
on
its
faith
shows
that
the
shipper
--
the
shipping
public
was
constrained
in
the
choice
that
was
open
to
it
in
selecting
its
carrier,
isn't
that
it?
have
i
stated
the
case
fairly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
compulsion
in
the
nature
of
things
that
if
a
fellow
said
you
can't
get
my
land
unless
you
promise
to
send
stuff
over
my
line
that
that
necessarily
is
an
inducement
for
shipment
unrelated
to
the
mere
fact
of
the
service
rendered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
his
reediness
to
have
the
decree
modified
so
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
on
that
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
should
we
--
would
you
think
it
was
appropriate
to
argue
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
decree
is
so
verified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
then
nothing
can
save
it,
but
if
it
does
make
a
difference,
then
his
readiness
of
the
decree
is
modified,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
assuming
to
indicate
to
be
ready
to
have
a
decree
modified
to
read.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
said
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
so
no
use
of
--
of
accepting
his
modification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
you
argue
as
to
the
anti-competitive
purposes
within
argument
a
part
from
the
document
then
justice
whittaker's
question
becomes
relevant.
that's
a
matter
for
determination
and
not
a
matter
for
legal
assumption
on
a
summary
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
if
you
make
that
argument,
but
if
you
talk
about
intention
then
intention
can
be
--
is
an
issue
of
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
vary
the
case
put
to
you
by
my
brother
harlan.
suppose
the
--
the
railroad
says,
the
northern
pacific
advertises
or
makes
known
that
it
will
sell
some
of
its
fee
for
x
dollars
per
acre,
but
it
will
sell
it
for
x
minus
y
dollars
per
acre
if
the
purchaser
agrees
to
shift
his
products
over
to
northern
pacific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
all.
they're
having
different
rates
for
a
piece
of
land.
anyhow,
put
the
elkins
act
aside
because
i'm
having
so
difficulty.
what
would
you
say
under
the
sherman
law?
will
that
be
better
under
sherman
law,
the
case
i
put
you?
they're
in
the
market
and
they
sell
land
as
the
northern
pacific
was
and
they
have
two
prices,
forget
about
the
elkins
act
for
the
moment,
would
that
be
violating
the
sherman
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
think
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
order
relied
too
much
on
international
salt
because
the
determining
consideration
there
was
within
abuse
of
the
patent
and
that
goes
a
long
way.
i'm
not
saying
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
that's
all
you
have
to
rest
on,
i'd
like
to
hear
more
argument
in
this
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
over
what
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
recent
--
are
the
recent
sales
or
leases
in
acreage
sizeable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
sizeable
--
the
sizeable
acreage
owns
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
were
there
shipper
from
centers?
shippers
who
did
not
have
lease
or
fee
holdings
from
the
northern
pacific
in
the
--
in
the
centers
from
which
these
shipments
were
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
you
--
if
that
is
so,
you
put
a
thought
in
my
mind
that
if
the
case
i
put
to
you
is
an
elkins
act
case,
i
should
think
all
these
things
(inaudible)
violations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
counsel
often
tell
us
the
things
of
interest
by
way
of
background.
well,
the
judges
also
have
that
curiosity
at
times
and
i
have
the
curiosity
of
--
curiosity
to
ask
you
whether
this
record
shows
what
blew
--
what
can
this
litigation
is
being
in
1949
when
this
is
a
long
standing
arrangement
on
the
part
of
the
northern
pacific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
in
the
record
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
something
that's
on
50
to
60
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
record
doesn't
show
that
something
from
new
--
of
course
effort
or
anything
like
that
is
made
by
the
railroad.
