justice

suppose
a

suppose
a
(inaudible)
that
it
would
sell
only
to
people
who
would
agree
to
buy
all
the
other
products
(inaudible)
would
that
violate
the
antitrust
act?
justice

black
substantial
is
what
you
actually
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
substantial
or
harmful
--
justice

black
--
effect
on
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
substantial
amount.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
insist
that
it's
not
a
substantial
amount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it's
a
matter
of
indifference
why
would
he
--
he
is
to
be
bound
by
contact?
what
you
do,
isn't
it,
is
to
get
balance
(inaudible)
agree
that
they
won't
trade
with
another
railroad
even
if
they
want
to
because
they
must
(inaudible).
now,
i
understand
you
say
this
condition
but
in
the
final
analysis,
if
it
gets
down
to
it,
they
can't
exercise
their
freedom
of
judgment
to
contract
with
other
railroad
even
if
they
desire
to
do
so.
and
they
do
that
because
you
tell
them
that
and
tie
them
down
by
that
validity
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
certainly
destroys
the
competition
to
some
extent,
does
it
not,
if
the
man
has
agreed
in
advance
as
the
terms
is
binding
as
it
appears
to
be
that
he
is
not
going
to
buy
from
another
railroad
because
you
sold
him
some
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
thought
we've
decided
several
times
that
the
contracts
who
violated
sherman
act,
restraining
a
man
with
his
freedom
to
trade,
didn't
have
to
just
like
everybody
(inaudible)
to
substantial
number
of
people
so
as
to
destroy
competition
from
a
substantial
number
of
people
located
at
one
place
or
in
any
places.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
--
does
this
exclude
competitors
to
some
extent
from
the
right
--
the
opportunity
to
get
to
sell
their
services
to
thousands
of
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
was
does
this
agreement
bar
to
some
extent
the
freedom
of
a
man
to
deal
with
your
competitors
and
does
that
affect
thousands
of
people
depriving
the
other
railroads
of
the
chance
to
have
them
exercise
their
full
freedom
of
choice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
this
in
addition
to
solicitation.
the
other
people
are
limited
to
solicitation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
have
a
contract
with
these
thousands
of
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
rather
(voice

concerned
with
leading
people
free

buy

other

free
to
sell
according
to
their
own
will
and
according
to
their
own
judgment
of
what's
better
at
best
interest
and
what
they
desire
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
does
go
that
far,
this
violates
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
did
that,
you
would
still
have
a
right
to
litigate
with
every
person
(inaudible)
and
claim
damages
the
amount
of
the
presentation
(inaudible)
every
time
he
traded
with
another
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
he
ever
know
at
the
end
of
the
lawsuit
(inaudible)
sometimes
a
ship
without
his
--
you
don't
have
law
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
will
you
enforce
a
contract?
that's
what
i'm
curious
about,
how
would
you
enforce
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
all
of
that
make
any
difference
or
premise
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
think
of
case
off
hand
that
a
person
has
been
found
guilty
of
violating
antitrust
law,
shown
to
have
a
complete
monopoly?
justice

the
standard
oil

had
a
complete

the

black
the
international
salt?
justice
hugo

black
would
you
mind
stating?
it
hasn't
been
stated
and
i
think
these
questions
ultimately
would
be
wise
to
state
it.
i
do
not
think
that
the
summary
judgment
should
be
used
every
time
a
judge
(inaudible)
to
use
it
when
he
gets
submissions
of
fact.
would
you
mind
stating
what
are
the
admitted
issues
of
facts
in
this
case
on
which
the
court
rests
its
summary
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
just
approximate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
located
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
farming
section
mainly
where
the
property
has
been
sold
or
was
it
grazing
or
farming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
been
sold
in
large
block
as
numbers
of
each
according
to
the
fact
that
you
have
in
your
record.
justice
hugo

is
there
any
dispute
over
there?
justice

is
that
conceded
or
stipulated?
justice

covering
large
numbers?
justice

has
there
been
any
departure
from
stipulation
which
it
made
with

to
the
volume

interstate

the
lessee
from

has
there
been
any
--
is
that
still
the
agreement,
is
that
the
agreement
with
the
--
did
the
court
have
that
agreement
for
that
stipulation
of
a
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
shows
that
would
have
been
very
expensive
and
i
gather
you'd
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
selected
lessees
from
shipments
under
each
various
stations
along
the
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
stipulation
(inaudible)
would
mean,
i
just
understand
that
the
counsel
for
the
railroad
(inaudible)
in
fact
that
there
was
substantial
amount
of
volume
(inaudible).
i
do
not
understand
what
--
what
issues
of
the
fact
they
had
the
court
to
decide
or
did
they
--
what
was
that
issue
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
took
the
position
that
was
given
to
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
did
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
fact
that
they
were
able
to
exert
leverage
is
essential
if
contracts
are
made
or
discover
a
substantial
part
of
interstate
commerce,
suppose
they're
made
voluntarily
between
the
parties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
it
make
so
far
as
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
a
three
steel
company
manufactured
35%
of
the
steel
of
the
country
that
would
combine
voluntarily
either
one
being
authorized
to
exert
some
kind
of
a
power.
they
just
decided
they
want
to
combine
or
fix
grievance
agreement
between
(inaudible)
would
that
not
violate
the
sherman
act?
