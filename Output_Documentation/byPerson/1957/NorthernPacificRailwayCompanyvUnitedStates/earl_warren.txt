mr.
countryman,
we'll
recess
now
until
tomorrow
morning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
countryman?
what
is
the
relationship
between
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
and
the
northwestern
improvement
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
all
the
lands
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
of
this
character
in
--
in
the
ownership
of
the
improvement
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
--
why
is
the
differentiation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.--
mr.
countryman,
isn't
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
millions
of
acres
of
land
that
cannot
be
opened
up
to
settlement
and
development
unless
they
make
agreements
with
you
that
they
will
not
use
the
services
of
any
of
your
competitors,
a
restraint
to
some
kind
on
your
competition
and
therefore
on
commerce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you've
got
--
you
check
a
board
this
--
this
country
for
ten
miles
on
each
side
of
your
right
of
way,
every
order
in
this
section
belongs
to
railroad.
now
if
you
can
--
you
can
prevent
any
of
that
land
from
being
opened
up
to
development
and
settlement
until
the
purchasers
agree
with
you
that
they
will
use
services
of
no
competitors,
do
you
not
think
that
that
places
some
burden
on
your
competitors
in
developing
the
service
that
will
be
as
--
as
good
or
as
cheap
as
yours?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
might
have
been
in
spite
of
your
--
your
policies
and
not
because
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
might
be
--
they
might
prevent
competition
or
at
least
suppress
competition
and
still
not
be
great
enough
force
to
prevent
those
great
things
from
happening.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
suppose
if
you
can
do
it
for
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
can
do
it
for
all,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
land
does
it
have
left,
do
you
happen
to
know?
