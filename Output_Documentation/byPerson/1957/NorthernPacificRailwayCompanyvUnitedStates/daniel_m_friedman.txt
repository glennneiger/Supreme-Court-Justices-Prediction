mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
contract
restrictions
which
are
involved
in
this
case
are
ones
which
basically
give
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
a
claim,
the
right
to
get
the
business
of
the
shippers
to
whom
it
has
sold
or
leased
various
categories
of
its
land,
as
long
as
the
northern
pacific's
rates
and
in
some
instances,
the
service
are
equal.
mr.
countryman
has
suggested
that
it's
a
practical
matter
this
case
must
be
treated
as
though
rates
and
service
were
written
into
all
of
these
contracts.
the
fact
is
that
they're
not
written
into
all
of
these
contracts.
the
contracts
vary
in
their
form
but
the
contracts
which
cover
the
majority
of
the
acreage
involved
in
this
case
are
limited
to
rates
and
do
not
authorize
a
shipper
to
ship
via
some
competing
carrier
merely
because
the
service
is
better
either
in
his
opinion
or
in
the
northern
pacific's
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
our
opinion,
mr.
justice,
that
would
not
be
the
end
of
this
case.
we
think
even
assuming
that
service
and
rates
are
covered
in
all
of
these
contracts,
these
agreements
will
nevertheless
be
bad.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'm
not
--
still
not
clear
as
to
whether
you
mean
by
that
that
he
concedes
and
in
all
instances,
every
one
of
these
contracts
applies
to
rates
and
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
even
if
the
decree
was
so
modified,
we
still
would
not
be
satisfied.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
in
any
event,
if
a
shipper
for
whatever
reason
as
a
matter
of
whimsy
as
your
honor
suggested,
wishes
to
patronize
a
competing
carrier,
we
think,
he
has
the
right
to
do
that.
now,
i'd
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
in
describing
these
restraints.
in
some
instances,
they
go
beyond
merely
requiring
the
lessee
or
the
grantee
to
ship
the
products
produced
on
a
particular
land.
in
some
instances,
they're
acquiring
to
ship
products
produced
not
only
on
the
lands
received
from
northern
pacific
but
on
adjacent
lands
in
the
same
area
which
he
then
or
thereafter
own.
and
indeed
in
some
of
the
leases,
leases
for
the
coal
lands,
there's
a
provision
requiring
him
to
ship
incoming
freight
destined
to
those
areas
by
the
northern
pacific.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
it
doesn't,
mr.
justice,
but
this,
i
think,
is
significant
in
showing
the
bold
anti-competitive
purpose
of
these
particular
clauses.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
on
their
face
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
these
agreements
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
are
designed
solely
to
exclude
competitor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
like
to
suggest
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
unlike
some
of
the
tying
situations
where
there
is
a
claim
at
least,
the
agreement
may
be
necessary
to
protect
the
goodwill
of
a
seller,
for
example,
the
claim
by
international
salt
company
that
international
salt
was
not
used
in
the
machines,
the
machines
will
not
operate
properly,
the
claim
by
international
business
machines
company
that
any
other
clause
do
not
permit
the
machine
to
function
if
there's
only
--
there
is
no
possible
claim
of
that
kind
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
you
have
land
which
is
sold
or
leased
and
there's
no
possible
argument
that
these
restrictive
clauses
are
needed
to
permit
the
more
efficient
use
or
the
better
use
of
the
remaining
land
which
northern
pacific
has.
this
is
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
depend,
mr.
justice,
upon
how
substantial
a
volume
of
commerce
was
affected.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
northern
pacific
leased
an
enormous
track
and
say
general
motors
and
general
motors
ship
many
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
product
over
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
where
they
are
or
in
the
position,
mr.
justice
to
impose
this
agreement.
i
believe
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
monopoly
power?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
suggest
mr.
justice
that
this
case
maybe
approached
on
two
different
theories.
the
theory
which
you
have
suggested
is
the
theory
of
the
tying
cases
enunciated
in
the
times-picayune
case
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment
and
believe
what
--
show
why
i
believe
we
have
established
that.
but
we
think
this
particular
situation
has
a
further
vice,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
you
have
contracts
which
on
their
face
show
no
demonstrable
business
purpose,
no
legitimate
business
aim
and
the
effect
of
them
is
to
preclude
competing
sellers
of
transportation
from
any
access
to
a
very
substantial
market.
in
other
words,
it
narrows
the
outlet
as
this
court
have
said
of
competing
sellers
and
at
the
same
time
denies
to
the
use
of
the
transportation
their
freedom
to
patronize
competing
carriers
and
that
we
think
that
where
you
have
that
kind
of
a
situation
whether
it's
on
a
wide
scale
and
whether
it's
a
substantial
restraint
of
interstate
commerce,
the
principles
which
this
court
has
applied
in
such
cases
and
associated
press
and
fashion
originated
skill,
compel
the
conclusion
that
these
agreements
are
invalid
on
their
face.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
the
railroad
can't
do
that
because
of
the
elkins
act
because
i
think
they
will
be
giving
a
concession
to
one
shipper
over
another.
they're
providing
the
identical
transportation
service
to
two
shippers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
there's
no
finding
that
they
had
monopoly
of
all
the
lands
in
the
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
correct
because
the
court
says
if
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
think
in
the
tying
situations
or
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
respectfully
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
if
we
start
with
the
international
salt
case,
if
i
may
refer
to
that
briefly
for
a
moment.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
salt
company
leased
patented
machines
and
as
a
condition
to
the
lease
of
the
machines,
the
lessees
were
required
to
use
in
the
machine
the
salt
manufactured
by
the
international
salt
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
no
showing
in
that
case
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
market
for
the
tying
product,
that
is,
the
salt
leasing
machine
international
salt
had.
despite
this,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment,
and
this
court
upheld
the
grant
of
summary
judgment.
now,
in
their
appeal
to
this
court,
international
salt
challenged
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
because
they
said
they're
entitled
to
show
that
there
were
competing
machines.
that
in
fact
competitors
were
not
excluded,
and
furthermore,
they
said
they're
entitled
to
show
what
percentage
of
the
market,
the
salt
machines
they
had.
and
this
court
deemed
those
considerations
irrelevant
and
then
subsequently
in
the
standard
oil
case,
this
court
in
discussing
the
international
salt
case
pointed
out
that
those
factors
were
present
in
that
case
and
they
were
deemed
irrelevant.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
cannot
think
of
any
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
standard
oil
company
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
roughly
60%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
international
salt,
the
court
deemed
it
irrelevant.
we
don't
know
what
percent
of
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
suppose
in
some
situations
involving
a
unique
patented
article
which
was
so
distinct
from
any
other,
there
might
be
a
situation,
i
don't
know
of
any
such
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
even
though
in
international
salt,
the
company
had
abuse
its
patents
by
seeking
to
go
beyond
its
patent
monopoly.
that
factor,
i
don't
believe
was
crucial
on
the
question
of
whether
international
salt
had
the
recusant
dominance
to
be
able
to
effectively
enforce
upon
its
lessees
the
obligation
to
purchase
the
tied
product.
and
what
we're
saying
to
this
court
is
that
the
kind
of
leverage
which
a
patent
holder
is
able
to
exert
in
a
situation
where
there
may
be
very
many
other
articles,
very
similar
which
will
do
the
same
thing
is
comparable
to
the
kind
of
leverage
which
the
owner
of
land
is
able
to
exert
as
we
think
it's
shown
here
by
the
fact
that
these
people
were
able
to
impose
these
contracts
upon
their
lessees
and
grantee.
now,
in
this
situation--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice,
anymore
than
there
was
an
issue
of
fact
in
the
international
salt
case
as
to
whether
the
salt
company's
particular
patented
salt
machine
nevertheless
represented
such
a
minor
share
of
the
market
that
in
fact
they
didn't
have
monopoly
power.
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
in
a
section
1
case
of
this
type
to
show
that
they
have
monopoly
power
in
the
sense
of
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
admitted
facts
in
this
case
are
that
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
has
sold
or
leased
a
substantial
volume
of
land.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly
several
million
acres,
two
or
three
million.
it
varies
from
things
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
located
in
six
western
states.
the
further
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
dated
back
50
or
60
years
and
the
leases
in
the
record
are
as
recent
as
1946
and
1947
i
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
haven't
made
that
analysis
of
the
record
but
there
are
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
there
was
a
sizeable
acreages
covered
by
the
leases.
it's
a
very
elaborate
breakdown
in
the
record
of
each
lease
and
the
amount
of
acreage
involved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
except
for
the
right
of
way,
it's
2,700,000
acres
out
of
the
total
land
grant
of
some
39
million.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
lot
of
it
is
grazing.
the
two
major
items
are
the
grazing
leases
and
some
of
the
grazing
land
has
been
sold
and
the
timber
leases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
been
sold
to
a
large
number
of
people.
it
doesn't
--
coming
through
this
--
the
acreage
varies
tremendously.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
not
shown
by
the
record,
but
i
--
in
view
of
their
contention
that
they
had
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
lands
involved.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
there
are
shippers
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
time
--
return
to
the
other
agreed
upon
the
facts
in
this
case
that
in
the
sale
and
lease
of
these
lands,
northern
pacific
imposed
covenants
requiring
the
lessee
or
grantee
to
ship
exclusively
via
northern
pacific
if
the
rates
and
in
some
instances
the
services
were
equal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
that
is
not
challenged.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
is
--
i
--
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
it
covers
rates
and
service
or
rate.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
all
there
is
is
a
showing
of
the
generally
substantial
volume
of
land
covered
and
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
at
page
99
that
the
information
to
the
particular
shipments,
by
particular
shipments,
is
either
not
available
to
the
defendant
or
cannot
be
furnished
by
the
defendant
without
excessive
expense
and
without
consuming
an
unwarranted
length
of
time.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
precise
dollar
value
of
shipments
affected
by
these
traffic
clauses.
there
is,
however,
the
finding
by
the
court
that
a
substantial
volume
of
commerce
moved
in
interstate
commerce
which
was
--
came
off
the
land
subject
to
these
clauses.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
2,700,000
figure
is
the
amount
of
acreage
which
northern
pacific
still
holds.
the
contracts
which
were
enforced
in
1949
when
this
complaint
was
filed
as
set
forth
in
--
at
series
of
detailed
findings,
13
to
35
at
record
203
to
208,
and
they're
roughly
about
2,200,000
or
2,300,000.
those
are
the
contracts
at
the
time
of
the
suit
that
were
covered
by
these
rulings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
but
of
this
amount,
roughly,
more
than
a
million
acres
are
timberland
sales
where
the
land
has
been
sold
as
i
--
in
other
words,
some
of
the
land
has
been
sold.
now
there's
a
million
acres
of
that
and
then
there's
roughly
a
1,200,000
acres
that
has
been
leased
and
1,200,000
should
properly
subtracted
by
the
2,700,000
--
from
the
2,700,000.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
doesn't
show
in
those
terms.
there's
no
findings
as
to
where
and
what
state
in
particular.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know
the
precise
areas
where
these
lands
are
located.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it
did.
the
stipulation
is
a
substantial
portion
that
there's
--
i
say
there's
no
particular
breakdown
as
to
the
precise
dollar
volumes
from
each
individual
shipper
or
from
particular
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
fact
stipulated
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
wasn't
--
basically,
i
would
say
a
recognition
--
a
concession
of
substantial
shipments
were
involved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
issue
of
fact,
they
wanted
the
court
to
determine
primarily
was
whether
in
fact
northern
pacific
had
a
dominant
position
in
all
the
particular
types
of
lands
involved.
in
other
words
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
they
--
they
wanted
the
court
to
say
whether
in
grazing
lands
in
montana
which
northern
pacific
leased
whether
in
fact
northern
pacific
had
a
dominant
position
in
the
sense
of
having
60%
or
70%
and
whether
it
only
had
5%
or
10%,
we
took
the
position
that
that
was
immaterial.
we
said
that
the
impact
of
these
clauses
was
such
and
the
fact
that
they
have
this
position
as
the
owners
of
the
land
and
were
able
to
exert
leverage
sufficient
to
get
the
shippers
or
the
grantees
to
enter
into
these
contracts
that
that
was
enough
to
violate
the
sherman
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
this
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
we
rate
the
international
salt
case,
we
don't
think
it
does
make
any
difference
but
if
the
--
under
the
times-picayune
case
where
it
speaks
in
terms
of
exerting
monopolistic
leverage,
we
believe
we
--
as
an
alternative
theory
meet
that
test
because
they
were
able
to
exert
that
leverage
in
this
case
through
the
possession
of
their
land.
but
we
think
there's
a
broader
position
and
the
situation
involved
here
which
is
that
they
have
tied
up
a
substantial
volume
of
commerce
and
with
respect
to
that
volume
of
commerce,
they
have
excluded
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
clearly
mr.
justice,
it
would
violate
the
sherman
act
because
there
was
a
substantial
--
it
was
a
restraint
on
a
substantial
volume
of
commerce.

now,
the
record
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
nothing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
mr.
justice,
and
i
frankly
don't
know
what
was
the
emphasis
to
this
litigation
except
that
i
supposed
that
it's
conceivable
that
with
a
limited
step
of
the
antitrust
division,
we
never
got
around
to
doing
it
until
this
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
does
not
mr.
justice.
and
in
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
point
out
once
again
that
these
agreements
have
no
demonstrable
business
purpose.
they're
solely
anticompetitive.
they're
designed
solely
to
give
northern
pacific
a
priority
on
this
business
and
we
believe
that
affecting
as
they
do
a
substantial
volume
of
commerce
and
narrowing
the
outlets
to
which
competing
sellers
may
sell
and
from
which
purchase
of
transportation
they
buy,
they're
invalid
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
in
holding
them
invalid
to
establish
if
northern
pacific
in
fact
had
any
dominance
of
all
the
lands
in
the
area.
thank
you.
