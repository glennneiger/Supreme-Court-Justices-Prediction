before
you
involve
on
this
substantive
discussion
to
carry
out
justice
brennan's
question,
am
i
to
inter
--
are
we
to
infer
that
your
answer
to
his
question
is
that
(inaudible)
this
arises
under
section
3
like
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it
raises
that
--
it
creates
a
new
problem
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
cases
before
us
on
the
pleading,
leaving
one
side
the
problem
that
was
amended,
it
is
a
section
3
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
tittmann,
why
didn't
the
--
the
title
of
the
act
is
an
act
to
amend
section
2
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
robinson-patman
act
doesn't
say
to
amend
the
clayton
act
to
its
entirety
just
as
to
amend
section
2
and
then
it
goes
on,
it's
amended
to
read
as
follows.
that's
could
be
logical
common
place
wherein
which
congress
legislates.it
does
it
all
the
time
that
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
stand
--
you've
indicated
that
you're
standing
on
the
moore
case.
that
was
clearly
explicitly
the
case
that
involved
2
(a)
of
the
clayton
act
was
relatively
difficult.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
this
2
(a)
hasn't
been
in
any
sense
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
at
any
time,
has
it?
