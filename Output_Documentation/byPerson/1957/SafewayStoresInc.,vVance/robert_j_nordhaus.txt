mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
this
case
of
vance,
who
was
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
of
frank
melvin
thompson
rose
in
the
district
of
new
mexico
and
it
might
help
in
determining
the
type
of
case
which
congress
attempted
to
reach
under
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
to
just
outline
very
briefly
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
complaint
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
the
complaint
stated
that
safeway
is
a
fully
integrated
chain
of
grocery
stores,
the
second
largest
in
the
united
states
operating
over
2000
stores
with
sales
of
a
$1,600,000,000
in
the
year
prior
to
the
complaint
--
filing
of
the
complaint,
49,000
employees
that
it
operated
all
kinds
of
facilities
for
the
processing
and
distribution
of
food
including
33
grocery
warehouses,
24
produced
warehouses,
11
meat
warehouses,
jam,
jelly,
candy,
fluid
milk
processing
plants.
it
--
the
complaint
further
alleged
that
safeway
is
the
dominant
food
retailer
in
west
texas
and
new
mexico
operates
some
41
stores
in
that
district
with
26
in
new
mexico,
that
by
reason
of
its
financial
strength,
it
is
capable
of
destroying
competitors
at
the
will
of
its
management.
the
complaint
further
alleged
that
for
--
that
safeway,
over
a
period
of
six
months
engaged
in
a
practice
of
selling
merchandise
in
the
city
of
albuquerque
at
prices
substantially
lower
than
those
exacted
for
the
same
goods
elsewhere
in
new
mexico
in
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
in
the
grocery
business
in
albuquerque
under
section
--
in
violation
of
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
it
further
alleged
that
over
a
period
of
about
a
year,
safeway
sold
goods
at
unreasonably
low
prices
in
the
city
of
albuquerque
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
in
violation
of
these
acts.
it
further
alleged
that
safeway
sold
certain
staple
articles
of
food
which
were
important
in
every
housewife's
budget
and
the
sale
of
which
unreasonably
low
prices
was
calculated
to
make
it
particularly
difficult
for
competitors
and
designed
to
attract
housewives
to
safeway
to
the
destruction
of
its
competitors.
the
complaint
finally
alleged
that
as
a
result
of
these
activities,
many
of
safeway's
smaller
competitors
were
destroyed
including
this
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
yes,
your
honor
under
the
moore
case.
it
is
--
the
question
was
asked
as
to
why
this
action
was
not
brought
under
section
2
(a).
it
appears
to
us
that
the
only
discriminations
as
between
purchasers
which
would
fall
under
the
said
sections
are
discriminations
between
a
purchaser
and
santa
fe,
new
mexico
and
one
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico
who
were
not
in
competition.
safeway
is
a
completely
integrated
chain.
it
has
no
sales
other
than
retail
sales.
in
order
to
conduct
its
price
wars,
it
is
not
obliged
to
obtain
discriminatory
discounts
or
to
--
or
to
make
sales
to
purchasers
at
discriminatory
prices
that
is
purchasers
who
are
competing
against
each
other.
therefore,
the
complaint
was
brought
under
section
3
and
we
have
gone
into
a
little
detail
as
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
because
a
study
of
the
history
of
the
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act
and
the
robinson-patman
act
make
it
clear
at
least
to
us
that
this
is
the
exactly
the
type
of
predatory
action
that
congress
was
trying
to
reach
under
the
sherman
act
and
under
the
clayton
act
and
finally
under
the
robinson-patman
act.
a
study
of
the
clayton
act,
section
2
as
it
originally
passed
the
house
of
representatives
and
it
is
quoted
on
our
brief
--
in
our
brief
at
page
10,
shows
that
the
original
section
2
was
a
criminal
section
quite
similar
to
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
it
provided
that
any
person
engaging
in
commerce
who
discriminated
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities
in
the
same
or
different
sections
or
communities
with
the
intent
and
purpose
to
destroy
competition
or
injure
the
business
of
a
competitor
would
upon
conviction
thereof
be
punished.
as
the
--
as
section
2
finally
was
passed,
it
was
completely
watered
down
by
inserting
the
clause
as
shown
on
page
11
of
our
brief
where
the
--
where
the
discriminations
would
be
punishable
or
would
be
unlawful
only
where
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
maybe
this
substantially
less
than
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce.
and
as
senator
norris
and
senator
clapp
remarked
when
they
were
opposing
the
passage
of
the
bill
in
its
final
form,
the
conferees
took
all
the
teeth
out
of
these
section.
senator
clapp
said,
“the
way
that
section
was
finally
fixed
by
the
conferees,
there
would
have
been
no
gum
for
the
teeth
to
be
--
have
been
imbedded
in.”
he
said
that
there
was
no
lessening
of
competition
if
a
large
chain
across
one
independent
grocery
in
one
community
because
the
injured
party
could
not
show
a
general
lessening
of
competition.
and
the
predictions
of
senators
norris
and
clapp
were
born
out
during
the
enforcement
of
the
clayton
act
over
a
period
of
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
during
the
30s,
the
chains
grew
so
fast
and
their
operations
became
so
destructive
to
the
local
independent
that
congress
asked
the
federal
trade
commission
to
investigate
the
chain
store
activity.
and
as
a
result
of
that
request,
the
federal
trade
commission
produced
its
report
on
the
chain
store
investigation.
and
that
report
bore
out
what
senators
norris
and
clapp
had
predicted.
in
other
words,
it
brought
out
these
things
that
price
discrimination
particularly
locality
discrimination
where
a
chain
would
come
into
one
community
and
sell
at
low
prices
to
destroy
competitors
making
up
the
losses
in
another
community
had
become
so
bad
that
31
states
had
enacted
price
discrimination
laws.
they
were
not
completely
effective
because
some
of
the
chains
could
sell
at
uniformed
prices
in
one
state
and
make
up
their
losses
selling
in
other
states.
the
report
further
brought
out
that
during
the
period
of
the
most
extensive
growth
of
the
chains
the
mennen
and
other
cases
had
prevented
the
commission
from
making
effective
use
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
because
the
mennen
case
had
held
that
it
did
not
apply
to
discrimination
injuring
customers
of
the
discriminating
party.
it
was
also
doubtful
whether
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
intrastate
retail
distribution
came
within
the
act.
the
chain
store
report
also
pointed
out
that
the
executives
of
the
larger
chains
were
completely
unaware
or
expressed
no
concern
about
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
the
report
said
and
it's
quoted
in
the
brief,
“although
perhaps
aware
of
their
existence,
chain
store
officials
in
discussing
their
price
policies
might
be
little
or
no
mention
of
state
or
federal
laws
against
price
discrimination
as
influencing
or
limiting
such
policies.”
now,
the
robinson
and
the
--
bill
was
introduced
in
the
senate
and
the
patman
bill
was
introduced
in
the
house
with
the
specific
and
expressed
purpose
of
correcting
defects
in
the
clayton
act.
and
the
--
the
--
mr.
patman,
when
he
introduced
the
bill,
pointed
that
out.
the
debates
in
congress
are
replete
with
expressions
by
members
of
both
houses
to
the
effect
that
all
the
bills
introduced
and
there
were
several
in
each
house
wherefore
the
purpose
of
improving
the
clayton
act
and
reaching
practices
which
the
original
act
had
not
reached.
for
example,
senator
logan
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
the
judiciary
to
which
the
robinson
bill
was
referred
said,
“the
robinson
bill
is
a
proposed
amendment
to
an
existing
law
known
as
the
clayton
amendment
to
the
sherman
antitrust
act.
the
bill
would
close
many
dangerous
loop
holes
that
were
found
in
the
clayton
act.
senator
borah
offered
his
amendment
as
a
new
section
of
the
robinson
bill
and
it
was
passed
by
the
senate
as
subsection
(h)
of
the
proposed
amendment
to
section
2.
now
we
don't
place
the
same
significance
to
the
removal
of
subsection
(h)
from
section
2
that
our
opponents
do.
we
feel
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear
again
from
the
debates
which
i
won't
go
into
now
that
the
borah-van
nuys
provision
which
is
now
--
now
comprises
section
3
and
4
was
removed
as
subsection
(h)
so
that
there
would
--
the
criminal
provisions
would
be
separated
from
section
2.
and
senator
borah
in
offering
his
amendment
as
a
criminal
section
said
there
are
certain
practices
which
should
be
forbidden
as
a
matter
of
law
and
to
which
criminal
penalties
should
be
attached.
he
agreed
that
there
were
practices
that
were
made
illegal
in
section
2
which
--
on
which
there
might
be
some
questions,
but
he
characterized
these
practices
which
were
prescribed
by
section
3
as
fraudulent
practices.
so,
senator
borah
attached
his
amendment
to
the
robinson
bill.
at
the
hearings
in
the
senate,
many
witnesses
expressed
a
preference
for
the
borah-van
nuys
bill
over
the
robinson
bill.
representative
healy
of
massachusetts
introduced
the
borah-van
nuys
provision
into
the
house
as
a
substitute
for
the
entire
patman
bill.
and
again,
throughout
the
discussion,
the
senators
and
representatives
stated
time
and
time
again
the
objectives
of
all
these
bills
are
the
same
to
correct
and
improve
the
clayton
act
and
although
they
may
differ
as
to
detail,
they
are
entirely
uniformed
as
to
purpose.
now,
i
think
that
the
codifiers
recognized
this
purpose
when
section
3
was
codified
as
one
of
the
antitrust
laws.
again,
our
opponents
characterized
this
as
an
error.
we
--
we
feel
that
it
was
done
on
purpose
because
the
codification
in
its
terms
was
changed
in
the
1940
code
to
reflect
the
passage
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
it
was
deliberately
--
the
section
3
was
deliberately
retained
as
an
anti-trust
law
as
defined
in
section
1
by
the
code.
now,
we
maintain
that
that
constitutes
an
administrative
interpretation
of
that
section
as
being
an
antitrust
law.
it
has
remained
in
the
code
for
17
years
without
change.
it
--
it
had
been
construed
by
practically
all
of
the
district
courts
that
had
considered
it
as
one
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
bruce's
juices
assumed
that
section
3
was
an
antitrust
law
carrying
the
treble
damage
remedy
and
in
the
moore
against
mead
--
in
the
mead
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
also
stated
that
section
3
seemed
to
cover
the
practices
which
were
described
in
that
case.
in
that
case,
the
--
one
of
the
instances
--
the
jury
was
instructed
on
section
3.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
it
involved
both
--
both
sections,
your
honor.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
both
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
rely
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
no,
your
honor,
not
in
our
case,
no
sir.
again,
it
appears
to
boil
down
to
a
question
of
what
did
congress
intend
in
enacting
this
section.
we
again
maintained
that
it
was
intended
as
--
that
section
3
was
intended
as
of
--
was
a
part
of
an
act
which
is
--
it
was
intended
as
a
whole
to
amend
the
clayton
act.
section
2
was
expressly
amendatory
of
the
clayton
act.
i
don't
see
how
an
act
can
purport
and
state
that
it
amends
another
act
without
becoming
a
part
some
way
or
another
of
the
act
which
it
states
it
amends.
there
are
--
there
are
numerous
lower
court
decisions
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
a
law
maybe
amended
without
--
by
an
act
which
does
not
purport
to
amend
if
it
adds
something
to
the
old
act,
if
it
changes
the
rights
and
duties
under
the
old
act,
such
is
recognized.
so,
in
conclusion,
it
is
our
position
that
the
sherman,
clayton
and
robinson-patman
acts
are
closely
related.
the
later
enactments
supplement
the
earlier
ones.
the
major
purpose
of
all
of
them
is
to
protect
competition
and
to
prevent
monopoly.
secondly
that
the
terrible
damage
remedy
has
always
been
considered
by
congress
as
an
adjunct
to
antitrust
enforcement
and
a
very
important
adjunct
and
the
intent
of
congress
to
apply
this
remedy
to
violations
of
all
sections
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
evidenced
from
the
debates
preceding
the
passage
of
the
act.
then,
lastly
the
codifiers
in
enlarging
the
definition
of
the
antitrust
laws,
originally
contained
in
section
1
of
the
clayton
act
to
include
section
3,
carried
out
the
clearly
expressed
intent
of
congress
and
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
code
and
the
provisions
of
section
1
as
originally
enacted.
now,
the
question
was
asked
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
act
was
one
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
will
be
recalled
that
the
clayton
act
in
section
1
defines
antitrust
laws
specifically
as
the
sherman
act,
the
wilson
tariff
act
and
this
act.
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
was
passed,
i
think
less
than
a
month
earlier,
refers
to
the
same
acts
but
it
does
not
refer
to
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
this
act
as
one
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
was
not
included
in
the
definition
--
in
its
own
definition
of
antitrust
law.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
was
not
amended
for
some
time
to
include
as
a
definition
of
antitrust
laws
of
clayton
act.
