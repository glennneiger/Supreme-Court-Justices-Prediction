mr.
john
b.
tittmann
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
same
issue
as
the
one
which
has
just
been
argued.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
a
private
litigant
did
have
a
remedy
for
treble
damages
in
diametric
opposition
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
was
the
source
of
the
case
you
have
just
heard.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
no,
your
honor.
in
addition
there
was
an
allegation
of
territorial
discrimination
sales
in
one
part
of
the
united
states
at
a
different
price
than
sales
in
another
part
of
united
states.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
conceivably
but
the
compliant
was
not
laid
on
a
violation
of
section
2
as
amended
by
section
1.
it
was
limited
in
the
first
amended
complaint
to
charge
a
violation
of
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
the
way
the
case
arose,
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
was
filed
on
the
ground
among
others
that
no
private
remedy
was
available
because
it
was
not
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
embraced
in
the
definition
in
section
1
of
the
clayton
act.
the
district
court
sustained
and
dismissed
on
that
ground
alone
without
passing
on
other
grounds
presented.
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
of
course
that
the
private
remedy
did
exist.
i
realized
that
the
issue
has
been
already
discussed
in
brief
presented.
i
mean
the
difficult
position
of
not
wishing
to
repeat
anymore
than
i
have
to.
i
--
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
your
honor,
my
answer
that
i
would
not
personally
want
to
take
the
responsibility
of
inviting
in
amendment
to
the
pleading
but
i
think
in
fact
it
could
be
laid
under
section
2
(a).
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
it
has
not
yet
been
so
laid,
your
honor
and
it
was
so
laid
in
the
mead
case
which
i'm
sure
you
will
all
recall.
the
allegation
was
both
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
and
of
section
3.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
it
is
purely
a
section
3
case
on
the
pleadings
now
before
this
court
and
has
so
been
treated
both
by
the
court
below
and
by
counsel.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
for
your
information,
the
prior
authorities
which
were
available
to
that
court
and
also
the
court
of
the
seventh
circuit.
the
decisions
on
this
question
in
the
district
courts
were
very
limited.
there
are
only
two
outstanding.
our
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
judge
yankwich's
decision
in
the
balian
ice
cream
case
in
california
which
was
cited
in
the
briefs.
adapted
its
reasoning
and
based
its
decision
on
that
wholly.
after
that
decision,
our
district
judge,
judge
rogers
analyzed
that
case
and
decided
contrary
specifically
and
our
court
of
appeals
overruled
him
but
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
relied
on
judge
roger's
decision.
so
we
have
two
conflicting
district
court
decisions
and
they
are
the
only
ones
of
any
importance
because
they
are
the
only
ones
that
analyze
or
attempt
to
analyze
the
problem
and
two
conflicting
circuit
courts.
now,
all
of
those
courts
had
assumed
that
the
position
was
sound
that
the
definition
of
antitrust
laws
as
used
in
section
1
of
the
clayton
act
was
exclusive.
judge
yankwich,
as
well
as
our
court
of
appeals
took
that
position
so
that
any
litigant
trying
to
recover
for
a
violation
of
section
3
alone
of
the
robinson-patman
act
have
to
somehow
establish
that
it
was
one
the
antitrust
laws
for
which
the
clayton
act
in
its
section
4
created
the
treble
damage
remedy.
otherwise,
they
were
faced
with
the
problem
that
is
i
think
well
accepted
law
if
our
congress
creates
a
new
offense
and
fixes
the
penalty,
that
is
the
penalty
and
unless
a
violation
of
section
3
can
be
brought
within
the
definition
as
being
an
antitrust
law
defined.
there
is
no
private
treble
damage
remedy.
the
remedy
is
exclusively
to
criminal,
fine
and
imprisonment
provided
for
in
that
section.
now
to
do
that,
judge
yankwich
and
our
circuit
court,
talked
about
whether
it
amended
or
not
and
used
that
term
in
a
very
broad
sense
of
whether
it
is
generally
in
antitrust
field.
whether
it
adds
something
to
the
congressional
effort
to
control
monopoly
and
to
regulate
restraints
against
commerce
and
we
submit
that
one
of
the
fallacies
of
both
judge
yankwich's
decision
and
our
court,
is
if
they
are
using
a
term,
which
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested.
it
is
not
helpful
because
its
only
use
is
to
by
calling
something
amendment
you
therefore
assume
that
it
is
within
the
definition
and
the
argument
that
if
this
amends,
it
automatically
--
congress
automatically
intended
it
to
be
within
a
definition
and
therefore
to
have
a
treble
damage
remedy,
we
think
solves
the
question
by
assuming
the
answer
and
that
the
answer
must
be
found
in
congress'
actual
intention
regardless
of
the
term
amendment
as
to
whether
a
violation
of
this
act
should
have
a
private
treble
damage
remedy.
and
we
submit
that
the
entire
course
of
the
act
that
it
was
adapted.
the
actions
of
congress
in
other
examples
subsequently
indicate
that
it
was
not
that
intention.
i
do
not
want
to
review
again
the
legislative
history.
i
would
be
repeating
mostly
what
mr.
williams
has
said
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
question
of
whether
there
is
treble
damage
remedy
for
violation
of
section
3
was
before
congress
and
was
discussed
on
the
floor
but
only
in
this
sense.
representative
celler
was
opposing
the
bill
because
he
believes
the
penalties
were
too
strict.
he
did
not
want
a
criminal
penalty
on
the
businessman
for
the
same
act
for
which
he
is
subject
to
treble
damages,
an
act
by
the
way
that
is
common,
can
be
common
competitive
practice
selling
at
a
lower
price
and
to
become
the
very
malodorous
criminal
activity
that
section
3
seeks
to
reach.
it
has
to
be
characterized
by
some
very
bad
purpose
and
the
purpose
can
be
a
matter
of
degree
so
it
is
a
very
vague
and
indefinite
offense
in
that
sense.
but
every
time
in
congress
when
the
question
of
treble
damages
for
violation
of
section
3
occurs,
it
was
always
the
same
act
of
discrimination,
the
same
act
of
discrimination
can
violate
both.
now
the
first
clause
of
section
3
deals
with
discrimination
in
illegal
discounts
and
the
discounts,
and
the
quantity
discounts
and
the
discrimination
in
price
were
what
congress
was
concerned
with
and
there
is
no
where
any
discussion
or
even
adverting
to
sales
that
are
unreasonably
below
prices
for
the
purposes
of
injuring
competition
and
what
that
might
mean.and
nowhere
is
there
an
indication
that
congress
intended
that
if
a
man
sold
in
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
enduring
competition
which
by
the
way
is
this
section
3
as
its
ancestor
in
the
canadian
criminal
code
that
has
been
dictated
in
the
brief
that
nowhere
do
they
indicate
that
that
type
of
thing
is
going
to
be
subject
to
a
treble
damage
remedy.
now,
that
--
the
failure
to
realize
or
the
failure
to
specifically
bear
in
mind
that
the
same
act,
same
violation
which
could
create
both
remedies,
was
always
a
discriminatory
act
prohibited
by
both
sections.
the
--
the
same
matter
is
referred
to
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
of
bruce's
juices
in
which
case
the
purchaser
of
cans
was
seeking
to
avoid
the
payment
of
the
balance
due
because
of
the
fact
that
he
only
received
a
1%
discount
for
buying
500,000
cans
a
year
or
$500,000
i
believe
whereas
some
of
his
competitors
received
the
5%
discount
for
buying
a
million
or
more,
whatever
the
figure
is.
this
court
in
the
opinion
made
a
remark
that
a
violation
of
the
clayton
act
and
robinson-patman
act
created
a
remedy,
civil
remedy
for
treble
damages
and
did
not
distinguish.
well,
it's
true
that
if
in
illegal
discounts
where
an
illegal
discrimination
would
violate
both
acts.
the
violation
would
bear
treble
damage
remedy
but
not
under
section
3
as
such.
that
case
is
of
course
cited
as
authority
for
the
position
counter
to
ours
and
we
take
the
position
that
the
remark
was
not
necessary
to
the
decision
in
that
case
in
its
dicta
but
again,
as
illustrative
of
the
danger
of
not
distinguishing
between
the
act
of
discrimination
that
violates
both
sections
and
whether
or
not
a
civil
remedy
is
created
by
both
sections.
that
opinion
pointed
out
that
the
violation
that
it
referred
to
had
to
have
two
sales.
well
that's
not
true.
that's
true
with
the
discrimination
but
it's
not
true
of
section
3
because
section
3,
under
the
last
clause,
could
have
one
sale
at
a
tremendously
unreasonably
low
price
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition
in
that
area
and
that
would
be
it.
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
problem
presented
to
this
court
cannot
be
solved
by
the
use
of
mere
words
such
as
amendatory.
i
don't
think
it's
a
good
tool.
it's
what
congress
actually
did
in
enacting
his
legislation
and
that
also
present
--
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
that
is
a
difficult
question,
your
honor.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
remarks
or
even
on
the
florida
house.
one
of
the
representatives
was
objected
to
combining
these
two
acts
and
that's
what
congress
did.
they
combined
two
acts.
he
was
willing
to
vote
for
section
3
alone
but
he
was
not
willing
to
vote
for
them
in
the
same
bill.
and
his
characterization
was
that
this
is
a
hodge-podge.
he
further
indicated
and
i
think
i'm
close
enough
to
quote
him.
the
courts
will
have
the
devil's
own
time
resolving
the
inconsistency.
what
happened
was
that
the
patman
bill
was
introduced.
the
borah-van
nuys
language
was
rejected
by
the
house
but
included
in
the
senate.
you
had
in
effect
two
acts
separate
and
distinct,
attempting
to
reach
generally
the
same
purposes
and
the
borah-van
nuys
language
was
left
in
to
get
an
act.
and
i
think
it
was
representative
patman
who's
testifying
before
a
congressional
committee
on
this
very
subject
in
1950.
it's
the
language
in
citation
that's
here
in
the
brief,
he
testified
before
the
committee
that
section
3
was
included
just
for
that
very
purpose
to
get
a
bill
and
that
it
had
never
been
carried
as
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
in
his
opinion
it
should
be
and
that
he
hoped
in
1950
that
congress
will
do
something
about
it
and
amend
section
1
of
the
clayton
act
to
specifically
include
it.
i
would
like
to
advert
briefly
to
the
opinion
in
the
tenth
circuit.
the
basis
--
one
basis
of
which
was
and
again
they
were
using
this
word
amendment,
which
i
do
not
consider
it
very
helpful
method
of
solving
the
problem.
but
they
took
the
position
that
the
robinson-patman
act
in
its
entirety
amended
the
clayton
act,
therefore
was
in
antitrust
law,
therefore
treble
damages.
but
the
reason
they
took
that
was
that
there
was
no
enacting
clause
in
the
robinson-patman
bill
other
than
at
the
beginning
and
the
opinion
in
the
tenth
circuit
appears
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
32.
they
base
there
wholly
in
part
anyways
on
the
fact
that
bill
only
had
one
enacting
clause
is
hereby
enacted
that
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
is
remanded
to
read
as
follows.
and
that
since
they
didn't
have
an
enacting
clause
on
2
and
on
3
and
on
4,
that
2,
3
and
4
under
one
enacting
clause
therefore
had
to
be
an
amendment
as
characterized
in
the
enacting
clause.
it
is
significant
i
think
that
no
other
court
has
ever
used
that
ground.
it
may
be
significant
that
no
counsel
in
this
litigation
anyway
has
attempted
to
rely
on
it.
the
answer
i
think
is
to
be
found
in
the
brief
of
the
carnation
milk
company
in
the
previous
case
that
the
enacting
clause
of
any
bill
in
congress,
the
form
of
it
is
set
by
law
and
it
only
includes,
be
it
by
senate
congress
and
simply
or
something
be
it
enacted.
and
the
enacting
clause
form
of
it
does
not
contain
the
purpose
of
the
act
so
that
that
particular
ground
of
our
court
of
appeals
decision,
we
submit,
is
without
any
foundation
and
particularly
because
in
addition
to
fixing
the
form
of
the
enacting
clause,
the
laws,
congress
has
adapted
specifically
provide
that
it
shall
only
appear
once
at
the
top.
i
mean
it
is
not
permissible
as
a
matter
of
congressional
form
to
have
an
enacting
clause
preceding
every
section.
now
--
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
your
honor,
i
submit
that
no
--
that
it
is
not
at
all
significant.
the
amendatory
act
that
was
temporary
--
that
section
referred
to
temporary
legislation.
one
act
maybe
generally
amendatory
of
another
but
it
does
not
help
to
determine
whether
congress
intended
to
give
a
treble
damage
remedy
for
its
violation.
it's
our
position.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
i
think
--
pardon
me.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
well
that
is
our
contention,
your
honor
that
that
is
a
far
more
reliable
method
of
determining
what
congress
did
than
to
try
to
use
the
phrase
amendatory
and
thereby
bring
something
in
that
is
not
the
congress
obviously
didn't.
i
think
that's
pointed
out
by
judge
duffy
in
the
opinion
in
the
seventh
circuit
where
he
points
to
the
common
practice
of
congress
to
do
just
that
to
emphasize
or
perhaps
elaborate,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
question
by
the
same
token.
if
you
want
to
use
amendatory
in
the
sense
of
relating
to
a
subject
matter,
you
can
make
just
as
strong
an
argument
that
section
5
of
the
fair
trade
act
was
amendatory
prohibiting
unfair
methods
of
competition.
you
can
make
the
same
--
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
no
--
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
it
--
it
did
not.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
oh
the
--
the
question
they
use
the
word.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
i
understand.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
all
right.
the
other
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
is
the
authorities
or
some
short
discussion
of
the
authorities
that
have
previously
been
decided
in
--
to
mention
with
this
question
or
if
they
bear
on
it.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
--
court.
i
only
have
two
very
brief
comments.
i
would
like
to
further
elaborate
briefly
on
congress'
use
of
the
word
“amendatory”
in
section
2
and
point
out
that
the
title
of
the
act
is
an
act
to
amend
section
2
of
the
act
entitled,
“an
act
to
supplement
existing
laws
against
unlawful
restraints
and
monopolies,
and
for
other
purposes”
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
18
where
the
entire
robinson-patman
act
is
quoted.
for
congress
to
use
in
section
2
the
words
amendatory
act
is
perfectly
descriptive.
it
was
an
amendatory
act.
it
amended
that
section
2.
to
describe
the
act
in
that
fashion
is
nothing
as
we
see
a
statement
by
congress
that
everything
in
the
act
is
necessarily
amendatory
or
within
the
definitions
of
section
1.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
tenth
circuit,
they
relied
primarily
on
the
balian
case,
but
they
also
cited
the
same
district
court
decisions
that
balian
had
cited.
there
are
number
of
them.
i
think
they
are
fully
treated
in
the
briefs.
i
would
just
like
to
make
this
comment
that
on
analysis,
none
of
them
hold
in
answer
to
this
question.
in
other
words,
they
are
not
decisions
and
whenever
the
case
is
entitled
federal
trade
commission
against,
it
must
of
necessity
referred
to
violations
of
section
2.
the
only
square
decisions
on
the
subject
of
authorities
that
i'm
aware
of
are
the
two
district
court
cases,
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
the
balian
case
and
the
two
circuit
court
cases,
our
circuit
court
and
the
court
of
the
seventh
circuit.
thank
you.
mr.
john
b.
tittmann
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
make
these
two
comments.
the
position
that
the
codifiers
in
codifying
section
3
as
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
has
any
significance
as
an
the
administrative
interpretation
we
submitted
without
merit
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
act
permitting
codifications
specifically
provides
that
if
there
is
any
variance
between
the
codification
of
a
law
and
statutes
at
large
--
the
statutes
at
large
shall
control
and
i
think
that
negative
is
completely
any
intent
of
congress
to
place
in
the
hands
of
the
codifiers,
the
ability
to
buy
codification,
modify
or
change
in
any
way
an
act
adopted
by
congress.
the
only
other
comment
posing
counsel
frankly
states
he
does
not
rely
on
the
moore
case
and
i
think
probably
so
the
moore
case
is
not
a
decision
--
the
issue
is
not
presented
--
this
issue
was
not
presented
there.
as
to
the
argument
that
congress
has
always
considered,
the
treble
damage
remedy
and
necessary
adjunct
to
the
enforcement
in
the
antitrust
field
is
a
broad
statement.
it's
often
made
and
assumed.
we
think
it
is
not
necessarily
accurate.
they
didn't
use
that
method
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
they
did
not
use
it
in
the
stockyards
and
packers
act
and
there
may
be
other
acts
in
the
antitrust
field
that
have
not
--
the
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
use
the
treble
damage
remedy.
thank
you.
