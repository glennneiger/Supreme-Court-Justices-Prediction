mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
last
night
the
hotel
some
of
my
brethren
who
were
admitted
to
the
court
yesterday
were
teasing
me
about
having
a
dubious
distinction
of
having
been
admitted
to
practice
in
a
sport
coat.
i
was
afraid
that
in
as
much
they
noticed
my
improper
tie
that
some
member
of
the
court
might
have.
and
i
wanted
to
assure
the
court
that
it
was
not
the
lack
of
respect
but
for
lack
of
anything
else
at
the
time
to
wear
and
lack
of
capacity
on
my
suitcase.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
review
a
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$10,000
awarded
to
paul
russell
for
alleged
interference
with
his
right
to
work
during
and
admittedly
lawful
strike
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce.
the
phrase
therefore
raises
a
question
concerning
the
extent
of
preemption
on
the
field
of
interstate
commerce
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
--
i
will
refer,
if
i
may
to
the
petitioners
who
are
the
united
automobile
workers
and
michael
volk,
a
business
representative
for
the
union
as
the
union
and
to
the
respondent
and
plaintiff
below
as
russell.
the
union
was
certified
as
the
bargaining
representative
for
all
hourly
paid
employees
of
the
calumet
and
hecla
consolidated
copper
company
plant
in
decatur,
alabama
in
early
1951.
after
approximately
ten
weeks
of
fruitless
negotiations
to
procure
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
on
july
the
17th,
1951,
the
employees
and
the
union
voted
to
go
on
strike.
the
strike
began
the
following
morning,
july
the
18th
and
beginning
on
that
morning
until
august
the
22nd,
a
period
of
approximately
five
weeks.
the
--
russell
was
out
of
work
because
the
plant
was
closed.
almost
a
year
later,
approximately,
the
first
of
july,
i
don't
remember
the
exact
date,
russell
and
29
other
individuals
whom
he
had
solicited
filed
damage
suits
against
the
union
alleging
that
the
union
had
represented
the
employees,
and
if
they
had
call
the
strike
at
the
calumet
and
hecla
consolidated
copper
company.
and
in
order
to
make
the
strike
effective,
they
had
established
a
picket
line
on
the
public
street
where
it
entered
the
employer's
premises
and
by
mass
picketing
and
threats
of
violence
had
interfered
with
his
right
to
work
during
the
strike.
the
trial
court,
upon
motion
or
plea
of
the
union,
dismissed
the
plaintiff's
petition,
russell's
petition,
quoting
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
action
that
is
the
rights
of
employees
to
work
during
a
strike
and
the
rights
of
other
employees
to
participate
in
a
strike
and
concerted
activity
and
in
picketing
were
matters
which
had
been
granted
by
congress
to
the
exclusive
prudence
of
the
national
liberations
board.
russell
appealed
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
this
was
in
1952,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
reversed.
that
is
not
the
judgment
here
being
reviewed
but
their
decision
was
upheld
in
this
case.
and
in
that
case,
they
held
among
other
things
that
they
didn't
think
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
authority
to
award,
affirmatively
relief
in
the
form
of
back
pay
to
an
employee
and
that
they
thought
the
question
ought
to
be
decided
by
this
court
before
it
said
that
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
had
been
so
drastically
succeeding.
they
also
held
and
i
think
this
of
much
importance
that
the
action
in
the
trial
court
was
not
an
action
to
seek
the
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state.
they
recognize
that
an
individual's
action
for
redress
for
interference
with
his
right
to
work
was
not
an
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
but
was
an
exercise
of
the
state's
judicial
power.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
black,
none
others
are
in
--
so
the
case
was
returned
to
the
trial
court
indicative
for
trial
on
its
merits.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir,
may
i
read
it
to
your
honor?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
we
of
course
realized
that
there
is
a
difference.
this
is
at
page
677
of
the
record.
we
of
course
realized
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
action
of
the
state
in
providing
a
judicial
remedy
for
the
redress
of
wrongs
which
fall
under
the
exercise
of
the
police
powers
of
the
state
and
of
providing
redress
to
persons
for
a
civil
thought,
as
for
instance
violations
of
rights
by
unlawful
picketing
for
the
recovery
of
damages
to
which
they
may
be
entitled.
so
as
i
construe
that
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
we
construe
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it's
a
recognition
of
our
contingents
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
the
--
a
private
damage
suit
by
an
individual
to
recover
personal
redress
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes.
it
does
not
invoke
the
police
powers
of
the
state
as
such
but
is
an
invocation
of
the
judicial
powers
of
the
state.
yes,
sir.
of
course,
the
police
powers
being
the
right
to
maintain
the
public
peace
and
order
and
to
protect
the
use
of
the
streets
and
highways
and
the
public
health,
whereas
the
judicial
power
in
a
past
controversy
is
just
a
means
of
settling
controversies
between
individuals
and
since
here
invoked.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
there
are
such,
such
as
an
injunction.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
the
question
is
immaterial
for
or
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
that
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
difference
between
police
powers
and
the
judicial
power.
i
would
not
urge
the
court
to
draw
a
clear
line
of
difference.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
the
case
came
back
to
the
trial
court
for
consideration
on
its
merits
and
the
union
urged
in
defense
that
any
damage
or
loss
of
wages
which
had
accrued
to
russell
during
the
strike
accrued
to
him
a
result
of
a
lawful
strike.
that
is
we
contended
first
that
so
many
employees
has
had
voluntarily
abstained
from
work
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
company
to
operate
its
plant.
and
second,
we
contended
that
the
company
knew
that
and
deliberately
made
the
choice
of
not
attempting
to
operate,
and
therefore,
there
would
have
been
no
work
available
for
russell.
had
he
entered
his
place
of
employment
during
the
strike?
and
no
laws
could
have
resulted
to
him
because
of
excessive
picketing.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
it
was
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
he
claims
that
the
picketing
kept
him
from
--
it
caused
him
to
lose
pay.
we
say
that
it
was
the
strike
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
--
and
that
was
the
issue
which
the
state
court
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
--
decided.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
yes,
that's
what
his
contentions
were.
and
it's
our
contention
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir,
there's
a
hit
to
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
just
say
that
--
that's
what
he
contended.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
was
it
violent?
there
was
no
actual
violence
in
the
picketing
during
the
first
five
weeks
of
the
strike.
not
a
single
employee
was
arrested,
there
was
no
action
for
injunction,
there
was
no
actual
violence
until
five
weeks
later
which
i
will
explain
in
a
moment
that
when
the
company
attempted
to
reopen
the
plant,
there
was
some
unfortunate
incidents
of
--
one
unfortunate
incident
of
actual
violence,
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
closing
of
the
plant
five
weeks
earlier
when
the
strike
began.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
--
i
have
to
convince
the
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
though
that
type
of
case
is
under
the
--
within
the
exclusive
province
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
that
is
what
we
contend
and
that
is
the
case
that
they
pleaded.
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
any
--
any
employee's
action
for
lost
of
pay
during
an
admittedly
legal
strike
because
of
the
alleged
--
because
of
alleged
excessive
picketing
is
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
it's
within
the
exclusive
province
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
that
in
a
nutshell
are
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
is
our
case,
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
those
were
--
that
was
the
case
we
made
in
the
trial
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry
sir.
any
damage
which
accrued
to
russell
was
as
a
result
of
a
federally
protected
strike.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
and
therefore,
it
was
privileged
and
damage
without
injury
or
injury
without
right
legal
recourse
because
of
the
federal
policy
to
protect.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
and
the
state
recognize
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well,
that's
what
we
are
arguing,
yes,
sir,
is
that
--
the
very
fact
that
federal
policy
has
defined
or
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
and
the
right
to
picket,
the
right
to
strike,
the
right
--
the
definition
and
guarantee
as
this
court
has
call
it
in
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
are
the
right
also
guaranteed
that
the
legal
right
to
exercise
that
right,
free
of
liability
from
damages.
if
--
if
you
can't
exercise
a
right
free
of
damages,
you
have
no
right.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
proximate
cause
of
russell's
damage
was
excessive
picketing
that
is
if
he
had
entered,
he
could
have
worked
and
the
only
thing
that
kept
him
out
from
working
was
excessive
picketing.
and
on
--
on
the
other
hand,
if
his
damage
accrued
to
him
because
of
a
federally
protected
right
to
strike
and
the
damage
--
and
there
would
have
been
no
work
if
has
entered
because
so
many
employees
were
out
of
the
plant
and
would
have
not
operated
anyway
then
he
couldn't
recover.
now,
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
review
the
facts,
the
facts
and
those
issues
there
i
think
are
merely
illustrative
of
the
fact
as
we
contend
that
in
this
case,
issues
of
federal
right
and
federal
law
which
have
been
granted
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
by
congress
was
submitted
and
adjudicated
and
decided
by
a
state
court
jury.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
can
talk
a
lot
easier
this
way
than
i
can
from
note.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well,
i
hope
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
a
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
haven't
gotten
to
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
there's
a
lot
to
it.
and
i'm
afraid
perhaps
that
i
haven't
made
it
quite
clear.
briefly,
the
facts
which
developed
were
these,
and
the
state
court
did
protect
this
rights
you're
talking
about.
that
is
they
didn't
protect
it.
they
--
but
they
submitted
the
adjudication
of
the
right
to
a
jury
to
decide
whether
or
not
which
right
was
fair
amount
and
which
right
or
which
violation
had
caused
them.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
that's
our
own
point,
sir
and
in
fact,
i
think
that's
all
there
is
to
the
case.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i'll
--
i'll
let
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
decide
whether
i
should
talk
or
not?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
think
that
is
the
case
--
in
a
nutshell
is
that
section
7
rights
granted
by
congress
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
were
handed
to
a
state
court
jury
to
say
whether
or
not
federal
right
--
the
right
to
strike
had
been
exceeded
and
the
right
to
picket
or
what
were
the
limits
on
the
exercise
of
a
federal
right.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
he
claimed
that
he
was
kept
from
going
in
to
work
by
excessive
picketing,
mass
picketing.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
but
--
but
we
say
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
work
if
he
had
gone
in
and
he
claimed
there
would
have
been
and
we
say
that
it
was
--
that
was
a
question
for
the
labor
board
to
decide.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir,
yes.
briefly,
the
facts
which
illustrate
this
point
that
federal
rights
granted
to
the
custody
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
were
adjudicated
were
that
on
july
the
17th,
approximately
400
out
of
550
hourly
paid
employees
voted
to
go
on
strike
the
next
day.
immediately,
after
they
had
voted
to
go
on
strike,
a
committee
of
the
employees
went
to
the
company's
bargaining
committee
and
advised
them
that
there
had
been
a
strike
vote
and
offered
to
furnish
hourly
paid
employees
to
work
during
the
strike,
in
order
to
maintain
the
company
plant
and
equipment.
now,
that
offer
was
declined
by
the
company.
now,
we
mentioned
that
because
we
think
that
is
an
indication
along
with
some
other
factors.
i'll
briefly
mention
that
the
company
voluntarily
elected
not
to
try
to
operate
the
plant
during
the
strike,
and
it
throws
a
light
on
whether
or
not
federal
rights
were
adjudicated.
they
said
that
they
had
supervisor
employees
who
could
attend
to
the
plant
maintenance
during
the
strike.
another
indication
that
the
company
decided
to
close
down
was
at
7:30
on
the
morning
the
strike
began,
the
company
began
to
close
down.
they
began
to
discharge
copper
out
of
the
furniture
of
the
plant.
a
procedure
which
normally
was
done
only
when
the
company
was
preparing
to
close
down
and
mind
you
this
was
30
minutes
before
the
next
shift
of
employees
was
due
to
come
on
work.
in
other
words,
they
began
to
close
down
before
they
knew
whether
an
employee
--
employees
were
going
to
come
in
on
the
next
shift
or
not.
one
of
the
foreman
mr.
bevis
testified
that
he
advised
some
of
his
employees
that
the
company
was
not
going
to
operate
during
the
strike
and
that
he
did
that
because
he
had
been
advised
by
top
management
of
--
that
the
company
was
not
going
to
operate
because
of
an
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
union.
and
the
agreement
was
the
meeting
on
the
afternoon
of
july
17th
when
the
company
declined
the
offer
of
supervisory
employees.
there
were
other
indications
which
i
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
the
company
didn't
intend
to
operate.
mr.
russell,
just
before
8
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
july
18th,
approached
the
picket
line
and
as
he
came
up,
one
of
the
employee
says,
“paul,
the
plant
is
on
strike
and
there
is
no
any
work
today”
or
words
to
that
effect,
and
he
replied,
“go
to
hell”
which
shows
he
is
animus,
i
think
toward
the
union
activity.
he
then
drove
on
down
this
was
about
200
yards
from
the
picket
line,
he
drove
going
down
to
the
picket
line
which
had
been
established
at
the
end
of
a
public
street
where
it
entered
the
plant
premises.
in
other
words,
it
was
established
at
a
dead
end
of
plant
--
of
public
property
at
the
edge
of
the
plant
property.
there
were
about
300
employees
there
picketing.
they
were
there
having
been
instructed
to
come
down
so
that
picket
schedules
could
be
organized
and
i
assume
in
the
interest
of
their
personal
interest
in
the
strike
as
they
had
a
constitutional
right
to
assemble
peaceably.
he
came
to
the
picket
line
and
the
picket
line
did
not
open
for
him
to
take
his
automobile
through,
although
it
was
opening
for
supervisory
employees
to
go
through.
as
one
--
as
a
bus
started
through,
mr.
russell
tried
to
follow
the
bus
through
the
picket
line,
and
when
he
did
--
when
he
did
try
to
follow
it
through
the
picket
line,
closed
back
in
front
of
him
and
someone
shouted,
“turn
him
over.”
someone
else
shouted
“shut
up”
so
he
stopped
and
sat
there
about
an
hour
and
a
half.
the
picket
line
didn't
open
and
he
turned
around
and
left.
and
he
testified
himself
nobody
touched
him,
nobody
touched
his
automobile
or
harmed
his
automobile,
some
of
them
leaned
on
it,
there
was
no
damage
to
him
personally
or
damage
to
his
property.
there
was
no
actual
violence.
nobody
was
arrested
on
that
occasion.
there
was
no
--
no
actual
violence
on
that
occasion.
so
he
left,
and
immediately
began
a
back
to
work
movement,
began
circulating
petitions
which
were
addressed
to
the
company
saying,
“if
the
company
will
reopen
the
gates
to
the
people,
we
will
cross
the
picket
line
and
return
to
work,”
which
we
think
is
an
indication
that
they
knew
the
company
had
closed
the
plant
down,
because
of
by
the
wording
on
the
petition.
after
starting
the
petition,
he
went
to
see
his
attorney,
mr.
harris
and
advised
mr.
harris
according
to
his
own
testimony
that
it
would
take
the
company
from
200
to
250
employees
to
operate
the
plant,
because
the
plant
was
a
highly
integrated
continuous
processing
operation.
so
mr.
harris
advised
him,
according
to
his
testimony,
well
had
have
to
get
many
people
to
sign
a
petition
before
the
company
would
agree
to
reopen,
and
they
send
him
out
to
do
that.
and
in
suing
five
weeks,
he
was
successful
along
with
other
employees
in
getting
about
240
signatures
to
a
petition
which
was
worded
and
prepared
by
mr.
harris,
to
the
effect
that
if
the
company
will
reopen
the
plant,
we
will
resume
work
on
the
same
terms
and
conditions
of
work
as
existed
at
the
time
the
work
stoppage
began.
now
that
petition
together
with
a
letter
from
mr.
harris
was
delivered
to
the
company
just
about
august
the
20th.
with
the
letter
explained
to
the
company
in
substance,
national
labor
relations
board
decisions
to
the
effect
that
the
company
had
a
legal
right
to
hire
employees
and
reopen
the
plant
even
though
other
employees
continue
to
strike
and
picket.
so
during
this
period
of
five
weeks,
mr.
russell
didn't
go
down
to
the
picket
line
except
on
two
occasions,
he
went
down
too
see
what
was
going
on,
see
whether
the
pickets
were
still
there.
he
didn't
go
down
or
making
an
attempt
to
work.
he
said
that
he
assumed
there
was
no
work
and
didn't
contact
the
company
to
see
if
there
was
any
work.
during
this
period
of
five
weeks
from
july
the
18th
until
august
the
20th,
the
company
showed
not
the
first
intention
to
want
to
operate
the
plant
by
any
action
whatever.
they
didn't
procure
an
injunction,
they
didn't
attempt
to
bring
in
any
materials,
they
didn't
attempt
to
have
anybody
arrested,
no
one
was
arrested
not
until
they
got
this
petition.
they
didn't
do
a
thing
to
indicate
any
wish
to
--
for
the
hourly
employees
to
work.
now,
and
as
i
say,
there
had
been
absolutely
no
actual
violence
up
to
that
time.
immediately,
upon
receiving
the
back
to
work
petition,
the
company
advised
all
employees
by
newspaper
ad
and
by
letter,
that
the
plant
would
reopen
on
august
22nd
and
they
were
urged
to
come
back
to
work
at
8
o'clock,
all
employees
and
they
would
be
reassigned
later.
on
august
the
28th,
preparatory
to
opening
and
this
was
after
they
had
gotten
the
back
to
work
petition,
they
sent
a
dinky
locomotive
out
of
the
picket
line
to
bring
in
five
railroad
columns
of
copper
which
had
been
left
to
the
picket
line
by
the
railroad.
when
they
did,
the
picket
line
moved
from
the
street
over
on
to
the
railroad
track
and
obstruct
its
progress.
the
police
were
there
and
determined
that
there
would
be
a
violence
if
they
try
to
bring
in
the
columns
of
copper
so
they
started
back
with
the
train
and
found
that
the
tracks
had
been
braced
and
the
--
ignition
wires
and
distributive
head
on
the
dinky
engine
had
been
removed
and
air
hoses
removed.
that
actually
was
the
only
actual
violence
up
throughout
the
entire
period
of
the
strike.
now,
not
a
single
representative
of
the
union
was
present
on
that
occasion
and
neither
was
mr.
russell
was
there.
we
object
to
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
because
we
said
there
had
no
indication
or
no
tendency
to
show
any
damage
to
him
which
it
accrue
as
a
result
of
the
plant
closing
down
and
shared
no
light
on
why
the
plant
closed
down.
but
it
was
admitted
on
the
theory
that
it
might
show
intention
on
our
part
to
engage
in
violence
if
it
had
been
necessary
on
july
the
18th.
so
he
returned
to
work
on
august
the
22nd
after
five
weeks.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir,
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
rule
on
the
evidence.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
this
to
illustrate
that
there
was
a
real
conflict
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
it
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
--
it
kept
out
as
a
result
of
violence.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
in
substance
to
this,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
of
course,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
in
substance
that
an
employee
has
the
right
to
engage
in
a
strike.
they
have
a
right
to
join
unions
and
the
right
to
shutdown
a
plant
by
a
strike,
those
are
federal
rights.
any
--
in
any
charge
the
jury
that
any
damage
which
accrued
to
the
plaintiff
as
a
result
of
the
local
strike
could
not
be
recovered.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
and
if
the
plant
was
closed
down
because
of
the
strike,
there
could
be
no
recovery
but
he
charged
them
then.
but
if
you
find
that
there
would
have
been
work
and
he
was
prevented
from
entering
the
plant
and
from
working
only
by
violent
picketing
then
you
can
return
to
work.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
we
don
t
ask
the
court
to
decide
that.
now,
we
put
that
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
but
the
only
question
or
the
reason
i
discuss
it
now
is
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
to
illustrate
sir,
that
the
jury
was
adjudicating.
first,
the
extent
of
the
federally
guaranteed
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activity,
the
right
to
strike
and
was
adjudicating
the
right
of
an
employee
to
work
in
the
face
of
a
lawful
strike,
matters
rights
guaranteed
and
protected
by
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
entrusted
to
the
remedial
custody
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
we
say
is
exclusive.
now,
all
this
has
been
designed
to
illustrate
to
the
court
that
those
rights
were
adjudicated.
the
federal
rights
were
adjudicated
by
the
jury.
and
he
--
he
lost
only
$450
in
wages
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
$10,000
in
damages.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
$10,000
in
damages.
he
was
not
touched
personally.
there
was
no
battery.
there
was
no
damage
to
his
automobile.
this
whole
thing
was
he
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
--
wasn't
able
to
work?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
it
was
just
less
than
five
weeks
and
he
earned
a
little
about
a
hundred
dollars
a
week,
$450.00
in
rounded
figures.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir,
just
to
illustrate
the
--
the
fantastic
damages
or
a
verdict
which
was
returned
of
$10,000.
that
is
$9500
in
punitive
damages.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
now,
prior
to
the
taft-hartley
act,
your
honors,
there
was
no
attempt
made
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
regulate
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
union.
but
in
1947
in
customs
to
public
demands
that
unions
be
made
responsible.
the
congress
amended
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
enacting
the
taft-hartley
act
and
there
were
several
changes
among
the
most
material
here
are
the
amendment
to
section
7.
prior
to
section
--
to
1947,
section
7
had
provided
that
employees
shall
have
the
right
to
engage
any
concerted
activity,
and
that's
about
the
substance
of
it.
that
was
the
only
guarantee
that
employees
shall
have
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activity.
the
1947
act,
however,
added
before
the
right
that
employees
shall
also
have
the
right
to
refrain
from
any
such
activities.
now,
that
was
construed
by
this
court
and
in
accordance
with
the
statements
of
congress,
that
is
employees
are
guaranteed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
the
right
to
work
in
the
face
of
a
strike
if
they
so
desire.
in
order
to
implement
that
guarantee,
congress
amended
section
8
by
adding
section
8
(b)
which
defined
unfair
labor
practices
on
the
part
of
unions.
among
which
were
interference
with
the
right
of
employes
to
engage
in
section
7
guarantees,
so
interference
to
the
section
7
guarantee.
and
of
course
discrimination
in
employment
and
secondary
boycotts
in
8
(b)
(4)
and
jurisdictional
strikes
and
so
on.
and
to
implement
that
they
gave
the
board
of
course
a
continued
authority
under
section
10
(c)
to
remedy
unfair
labor
practice.
in
explaining
the
purpose
of
the
amendments
in
section
1
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
is
29
u.s.c.
141,
the
congress
said,
“it
is
the
purpose
and
policy
of
this
act
in
order
to
promote
the
full
flow
of
commerce
to
prescribe
the
legitimate
rights
of
both
employees
and
employers
and
their
relations
affecting
commerce
to
provide
orderly
and
peaceful
procedures
for
preventing
the
interference
by
either
with
the
legitimate
rights
of
the
other.
to
protect
the
individual
rights
--
the
rights
of
the
individual
employees
and
their
relations
with
labor
organizations
who
activities
affect
commerce,
to
define
and
prescribe
practices
on
the
part
of
labor
and
management
which
affect
commerce
and
economical
to
the
general
welfare
and
protect
the
rights
of
the
public
in
the
connection
with
labor
disputes
affecting
commerce.”
now
that
declaration
of
purpose
in
the
light
of
the
congressional
history
in
section
7
and
section
8
induced
this
court
in
the
bus
driver's
case
to
say
that
congress
and
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
the
amended
act
had
regulated
and
defined
the
rights
of
employees
and
had
protected
the
right
of
employees
to
work
during
a
strike.
and
he
said
it
is
clear
that
when
congress
took
those
rights
in
hand
by
the
national
labor
relation
--
by
section
7
that
the
states
could
not
exercise
any
jurisdiction
over
section
7
guarantee.
and
that's
our
whole
case
is
that
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
--
i
will,
mr.
justice
black.
the
laburnum
case
and
the
kohler
case
and
i
want
to
discuss
those
and
i'll
try
to
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
rainfair
case,
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
that's
the
kohler
case.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
but
our
--
our
position
is,
i
think
that
just
to
conclude
is
that
the
court
has
held
uniformly
that
insofar
as
congress
has
regulated
rights
and
provided
a
forum
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
their
protection
and
redress
that
provided
guarantees
to
employees
that
the
--
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
is
withdrawn.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
and
we
say
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
in
as
much
as
congress
regulated
the
concerted
activities
and
guaranteed
the
rights
of
employees
in
section
7
of
the
act
and
provided
that
interference
with
those
rights
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
which
the
unions
were
responsible
and
gave
a
remedy
which
remedy
we
believe
is
adequate
to
redress
the
employee
and
back
pay.
in
other
words,
it's
our
position
and
we
think
without
question,
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
the
authority
to
grant
to
the
employee,
whose
rights
under
the
act
are
infringed,
all
of
the
remedial
relief
which
was
granted
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
the
board
could
have
ordered
the
union
to
give
him
the
$450
back
pay
in
remedial
relief
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
a
court
of
appeals
has
held
otherwise.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
didn't
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
a
ruling
by
a
court
of
appeals.
the
board
has
held
to
the
contrary
but
we
think
their
ruling
is
clearly
error
and
we
cover
that
subject
completely
in
our
brief
at
pages
45
through
56.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
that's
first
time
sir
we've
had
that
case
brought
to
our
attention
at
all
and
didn't
find
any
so
ruling.
the
house
bill
3020
in
1947
in
section
10a
specifically
provided
that
an
individual,
an
employee
whose
right
to
work
during
a
strike
was
infringed
would
have
a
right
to
bring
a
suit
in
a,
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
as
i
recall,
the
words,
venerated,
provided
a
court
remedy
for
interference
with
the
right
to
work.
the
conference
committee
of
the
house
and
senate
specifically
rejected
the
house
proposed.
and
in
lieu
of
the
house
proposal
to
provide
a
court
remedy
for
the
same
type
conducts
involved
in
this
case
provided
the
amendment
to
section
7
which
guaranteed
the
right
to
work
and
provided
section
8
(b)
(1),
given
the
national
labor
relation
board
jurisdiction.
therefore
we
think
it's
pretty,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
congressional
history
that
congress
specifically
rejected
the
right
to
bring
a
legal
action
to
enforce
the
rights
involved
in
this
case.
therefore,
if
we
are
correct
and
we
are
quite
sure
under
the
rulings
of
the
court
which
held
that
the
board
has
the
authority
to
grant
any
relief
it
deems
necessary
--
any
remedial
relief
it
deems
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
the
board
does
have
that
power.
therefore,
necessarily
the
remedy
provided
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
remedy
provided
by
the
state
court
in
this
case.
and
therein
as
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
about
the
laburnum
case
yesterday,
therein
lies
the
distinction
we
believe
between
this
case
and
the
laburnum
case.
the
laburnum
case
was
a
case
of
an
employer
whose
lawful
right
to
conduct
his
business
free
from
interference
was
interfered
with
by
violent
conduct.
the
court
there
held
that
there
was
no
parallel
remedy
provided
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
redress
the
injury
which
was
the
subject
matter
of
that
suit
and
that
of
course
is
true.
the
national
labor
relations
act
makes
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
guarantee
the
right
of
an
employee
to
conduct
his
business.
there
is
no
guarantees
which
parallel
to
the
employer,
the
guarantees
afforded
to
the
right
of
an
employee
to
work
and
that
i
think
is
a
primary
distinction
between
laburnum
and
the
present
case.
we
do
believe
that
the
laburnum
case,
if
it
were
before
the
court
for
decision
again
would
probably
be
decided
differently
because
the
adjudication
by
the
state
court
in
that
case
necessarily
involves
the
adjudication
of
concerted
--
of
the
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
and
the
extent
of
the
--
exercise
of
that
right
is
a
matter
which
has
been
given
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
at
any
rate
we
think
that
the
laburnum
case
carries
the,
to
the
fullest
extent
the
line
of
demarcation
within
which
the
state
can
act
upon
the
subject
matter
which
has
been
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
weber
case
i
think
very
clearly
pointed
out
that
it
was
necessary
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
provide
a
damage
suit
remedy
before
the
remedies
would
be
in
conflict
but
that
--
he
said
that
if
there
was
an
administrative
remedy
which
is
clearly
provided
in
this
case
then
the
weber
case
--
in
the
weber
case
instead
of
the
laburnum
case
that
the
court
would
have
decided
it
different.
well
here
there
is
a
remedy
provided.
secondly,
we
do
not
think
that
a
mere
allegation
of
violence
in
state
court
pleadings
gives
to
the
state
a
hunting
license
to
use
any
regulatory
or
take
any
regulatory
measure,
measures
that
if
it
sees
fit
or
that
its
courts
see
fit
or
that
a
state
court
jury
shall
see
fit.
in
other
words
a
mere
allegation
in
pleadings
that
violence
is
being
committed
doesn't
open
the
door
for
the
court
--
for
the
state
to
take
any
action
it
sees
fit
upon
the
subject
matter.
to
the
contrary
this
court
has
pointed
out
repeatedly
that
the
congress
intended
and
i
think
the
congressional
history
shows
it,
that
congress
intended
that
within
the
sphere
of
the
national
labor
relations
board's
authority
congress
intended
to
leave
only
to
the
states,
the
exercise
of
the
function
to
maintain
public
peace
and
order.
the
congressional
history
shows
that
pretty
clearly.
senator
taft
said
that
only
insofar
as
the
actual
violence
in
the
commission
was
concerned
did
the
two
--
did
the
act
overlap
state
remedies.
so
we
don't
think,
we
don't
contend
that
the
act
replaces
the
state's
injunction
power
or
its
authority
to
regulate
--
to
enforce
its
criminal
statutes.
but
there
is
a
limit
within
which
that
power
of
the
state
to
maintain
public
peace
and
order
in
an
emergency
maybe
exercised.
the
decision
of
the
court
we
think
illustrate
that
only
to
the
extent
it
is
necessary
to
maintain
public
peace
and
order
may
the
power
be
exercised.
the
power
may
not
be
exercised
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
accomplish
that
purpose
and
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
about
the
rainfair
case,
i
think
the
rainfair
case
illustrates
that
exactly.
there
the
court,
the
state
enjoined
all
picketing
and
the
court
very
clearly
know
that
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
necessary
to
control
the
injunction
--
the
violence
did
--
could
the
state
exercise
the
injunctive
remedy.
in
the
(inaudible)
case
the
same
case
was,
the
same
thing
was
true.
that
was
an
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
maintain
public
peace
and
order.
now
beyond
the
necessity
of
that
exercise,
the
congressional
history
indicates
that
congress'
original
intention
to
maintain
uniformity
of
regulation
would
be
carried
forward
and
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
of
yesterday,
which
i'm
afraid
i
misunderstood,
with
reference
to
the
punitive
damages,
i
understood
him
to
ask
as
to
whether
we
felt
it
was
a
federal
question
for
--
here
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
those
damages
were
excessive,
but
i'm
advised
that
i
misunderstood
the
question.
the
question
at
any
rate
i
think
possibly
you
asked
if
--
do
we
contend
that
whether
or
not
the
punitive
damage
feature
raises
a
federal
question,
involves
a
federal
question,
we
definitely
do.
the
power
to
inflict
enormous
punitive
damages
is
the
power
to
prohibit,
the
power
--
in
a
strike
where
several
thousands
workers
are
involved
for
instance,
and
say
200
suits
of
this
character
are
filed.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
there,
as
i
say
the
court
held
there
was
no
remedial
relieve
available
before
the
board.
here
we
say
that
here
is
remedial
relief
available.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir,
we're
not
implying
that.
i
think
the
remedial
relief
raises
a
federal
question.
there
is
a
power
in
the
board
to
grant
remedial
relief
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
but
the
punitive
damages,
your
honor,
illustrate
the
power
of
the
state
to
prohibit,
if
they
can
grant
punitive
damages,
enormous
punitive
damages.
suppose
a
labor
organization
or
local
labor
organization
has
a
trade
for
$25,000,
two
of
these
suits
would
bankrupt
by
state
court
juries
applying
their
standards
of
conduct
which
vary
from
the
standards
of
conduct
and
the
extent
of
permissible
activity,
protected
activity,
intended
by
the
congress
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
wouldn't
raise
any
federal
question.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
this
arose
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
because
the
federal
statute
had
not
been
inactive,
congress
hadn't
entered
the
field
and
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
conduct
involved.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
amount
is,
except
is
illustrative
of
the
fantastic
damage
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
only
that
the
power
to
impose
punitive
damages
is
regulation
of
the
same
conduct
which
congress
has
regulated
and
given
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
protect
and
redress.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
board
under
the
facts
in
this
record
and
again
the
facts
are
put
in
for
illustration.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
we
think
they
could
--
assuming
they
found
a
violation,
which
we
don't
think
they
would
on
these
facts,
but
assuming
they
did
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i'm
--
assuming
they
did
find
the
violation,
they
could
order
him
to
be
given
the
pay
which
he
lost
because
of
the
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
remedial
portion
of
the
relief
i
don't
think
they
can
--
the
court
has
held
they
can't
give
punitive
damages,
but
that's
a
matter
for
congress.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
the
board
has
specifically
held
in
two
cases
and
mr.
justice
harlan
mentioned
one
other.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
but
it's
held
in
two
cases
that
it
does
have
the
power
to
award
back
pay
in
an
8
(b)
(1)
case,
which
–
there
is
just
no
logic
in
that
holding
at
all.
it
awards
back
pay
under
the
same
section,
section
10(c)
which
says
it
can
give
any
remedial
relief
necessary
to
effectuate
the
policy
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
well
of
course
it
could
be
litigated
before
the
board
and
the
question
is
raised
here.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach
the
question
because
irrespective
of
the
extent
of
relief
provided,
the
courts
always
held
that
in
a
quasi
judicial
tribunal,
federal
tribunal,
the
extent
of
relief
congress
provided
was
deemed
to
be
is
--
all
the
relief,
the
congress
thought
necessary,
but
the
question
is
here
and
the
court
can
decide
it,
that
in
this
case,
it's
a
question
of
law,
not
of
discretion
under
the
facts
in
another
case.
it's
question,
whole
question
of
law
that
can
decide
whether
or
not
the
board
was
right,
and
it
maybe
necessary
to
decide,
if
the
court
reaches
it.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
your
honor
i
like
to
briefly
call
your
attention
to
item
one
is
that
the
provisions
of
302,
301(b)
refer
merely
to
the
fact
that
a
labor
organization
can
be
sued
as
an
entity
in
the
court
of
united
states.
it
creates
no
right
of
action
and
the
fact
as
mr.
harris
said
that
congress
said
they
treated
the
subject
matter
covered
by
section
12
of
house
bill
302(a)
or
302(o)
with
reference
to
suits
by
employees
effectively,
well
the
treatment
they
did
in
that
was
effective
was
by
putting
the
amendment
to
section
7
and
providing
section
8(b)
indicating
clearly
their
intention
to
divorce
that
power
on
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
many
reports
say
that
–
well
for
one
the
house
report
says
under
this
clause
the
board
may
also
require
a
union
to
reimburse
an
employee
who
loses
--
it
causes
to
lose
pay
the
amount
that
he
loses.
now
that
was
quote
on
house
302(o)
on
section
8(b).
so
they
said
there
that
the
board
did
have
that
power.
now
i
want
to
try
to
express
an
idea
that
a
comment
by
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
raised
this
and
that
is
apparently
the
idea
that
i've
heard
other
people
express
that
the
mere
existence
or
well
i
say
an
allegation,
but
let's
say
the
actual
--
the
existence
of
force
and
violence
is
itself
the
criterion
or
the
determining
factor
as
to
whether
the
state
can
have
jurisdiction
or
not.
if
it
were
the
criterion,
the
sole
criterion
as
mr.
harris
urges,
that
when
that
exists
they
can
do
anything,
well
then
rainfair
would
have
been
decided
differently.
if
they
could
--
if
the
force
and
violence
was
there,
it
gave
them
(inaudible)
jurisdiction
to
do
anything.
they
could
have
enjoined
all
of
the
victims.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
garner
case.
if
under
that
theory
violence
has
been
involved
in
the
garner
case,
then
i
think
the
court
--
and
that
was
the
criterion,
then
the
court
would
have
said
that
the
state
could
enjoin
violations
of
section
8(b)(4).
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
think
that's
right
sir.
that
proves
the
statement
i
was
making
i
think
sir
that
violence
itself
is
not
the
criterion
for
opening
the
door
for
any
state
action
in
a
case.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
think
it
opens
the
door
as
the
court
has
held
--
as
congressional
intent,
plainly
indicated
to
the
control
of
violence
in
the
interest
of
public
peace
and
order
in
an
emergency,
but
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir.
but
there,
now
there
in
the
laburnum,
the
court
--
your
honor's
distinction
as
pointed
out
in
(inaudible)
is
that
there
was
no
conflicting
remedy
provided
by
the
act,
while
here
that
is
a
conflict
remedy.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
well
it's
back
pay
and
it's
jurisdiction
of
the
board
over
all
of
the
rights
involved,
the
right
of
the
employee
to
work
during
a
strike,
the
right
of
the
employee
or
the
employees
to
engage
in
a
strike
and
picketing
the
extent
of
which
that
is
concerted
activity,
lies
in
the
best
of
the
board
to
say
what
is
federal
protected
activity,
how
far
does
it
go?
when
are
the
limits
of
it
then
exceeded
and
when
do
the
excesses
cause
a
loss
of
pay
to
an
employee?
thanks.
