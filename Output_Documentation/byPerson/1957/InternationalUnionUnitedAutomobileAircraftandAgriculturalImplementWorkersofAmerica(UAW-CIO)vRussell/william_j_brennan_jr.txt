justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
an
ultimate
ground,
mr.
goldthwaite
that
because
it
was
a
lawful
strike
and
a
legal
picket
line,
there
was
no
tort
in
any
event
and
if
there
was
a
tort,
there
were
no
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore
no
tort.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two
ways
you're
saying
that,
aren't
you?
there
were
no
--
no
tort
in
the
first
place.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
if
there
was
a
tort,
there
was
no
damage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
i
don't
understand
and
yet
you're
also
arguing
the
preemption
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
in
any
event,
there
must
have
been
a
determination
below.
i'm
not
familiar
with
this
record
that
there
was
a
tort?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
rainfair
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
wisconsin
case
in
351?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
goldthwaite,
what
is
the
redress
which
this
respondent
would
obtain
before
the
board
if
the
case
was
sustained,
that
there
had
been
a
violation,
a
part
of
the
union
which
i
take
it
would
be
a
finding
of
unfair
labor
practices.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
assuming
--
assume
with
me
if
you
will
that
a
case
of
violation
of
the
act
was
proved
on
--
as
a
violation
on
the
part
of
the
union,
now
what
would
be
the
redress
which
the
board
could
give
this
respondent
russell
in
that
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
but
please
assume
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
back
pay
in
other
words.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
know
--
are
you
--
are
there
any
instances
in
which
the
board
has
done
that
in
cases
of
this
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
as
the
law
now
stands
at
least
in
the
board,
the
redress
that
you
suggest
would
not
be
available
to
russell,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
was
it
also
part
of
this
case
that
would
have
been
work
available
had
he
been
able
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
the
judgment,
the
punitive
damages
were
not
separately
assessed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
harris
i
don't
know
that
if
at
all
involved
in
this
case
but
i
am
curious,
either
under
your
taft
act
or
otherwise
is
a
judgment
for
punitive
damages
reviewable
at
all
under
your
practice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
amounts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
it
may
be
attacked
with
successive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
tell
me
this
could
have
easily
been
a
100,000
or
million
dollars
as
it
was
10,000
--
