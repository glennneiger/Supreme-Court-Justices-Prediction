--
the
plaintiff
that
he
was
kept
away
from
work
and
is
therefore
by
a
violent
action
of
the
strikers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
jury
decide
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
arguing
that
there
was
an
amount
of
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
--
just
what
it
is
your
are
arguing?
justice

m.
harlan
wasn't
this
case
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
jury
that
they
could
not
find
for
the
plaintiff
unless
they
found
that
he
was
kept
out
as
a
result
of
the
violence
of
the
union,
wasn't
it
submitted
on
that
issue
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
that
theory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless,
he
was
prevented
from
working
as
a
result
of
the
violent
activities
of
the
union,
wasn't
that
the
theory
in
which
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
your
answer
to
my
question?
wasn't
that
the
theory
in
which
you
answer
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
wasn't
that
the
only
theory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.

m.
harlan
well,
that
was
the
sole
--
that
was
the
sole
basis
on
which
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
could
bring
any
verdict
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
is
what
you
are
arguing
here
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
justify
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
john
m.
harlan

of
all
the
discussion
about
the
evidence?
justice

case
in

justice
john

supposing
one
came
to
conclusion
that
the
board
did
have
the
power
to
avoid
back

to
this
man,
