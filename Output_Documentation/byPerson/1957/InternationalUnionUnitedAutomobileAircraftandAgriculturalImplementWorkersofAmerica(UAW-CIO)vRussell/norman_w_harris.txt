mr.
norman
w.
harris
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
before
entering
on
the
argument
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
an
inaccurate
statement
at
top
of
page
31
of
our
brief,
in
which
we
made
the
statement
that
senator
ives
was
one
of
the
opponents
of
the
amendment
which
became
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
act.
at
the
time
senator
ives
made
the
statement
which
we
quoted,
he
was
an
opponent
of
that
amendment,
but
later
he
secured
the
adoption
of
an
amendment
striking
out
the
words
interfere
with
and
he
said
that,
that
removed
most
of
his
objections,
so
he
then
voted
for
the
amendment.
there
is
also
an
inaccurate
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that
is
at
the
top
of
page
31
of
the
respondent's
brief.
there
is
also
an
inaccurate
statement
involving
senator
ives
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners.
it's
the
last
sentence
in
that
reply
brief
on
page
20
in
which
they
refer
to
senator
ives
as
one
of
the
opponents
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact
senator
ives
voted
for
the
taft-hartley
act,
both
when
the
conference
committee
report
was
adopted
and
when
the
bill
was
passed
over
the
president's
veto.
so
i
would
like
to
clear
those
inaccuracies
up
with
reference
to
the
voting
record
of
senator
ives
on
the
bill.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that's
page
20
of
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
the
last
sentence
in
the
brief.
i
get
the
impression
from
the
argument
yesterday
that
the
court
does
not
care
for
me
to
discuss
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
well,
the
facts
are
these
briefly.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
well
of
course
it's
set
on
the
background
of
the
facts
yes,
the
facts
are
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
the
plaintiff,
his
entire
claim
was
based
on
the
allegation
that
the
defendants
by
force
and
violence
and
mass
picketing
and
threats
of
violence
prevented
his
entering
the
plant
where
he
was
employed,
that
for
that
reason
he
was
unable
to
enter,
he
suffered
a
loss
of
wages,
he
suffered
mental
pain
and
anguish
in
addition
and
in
addition
to
those
two
elements
of
damage
he
asked
for
punitive
damages
in
his
complaint
to
punish
the
defendants
for
their
wrongful
conduct
and
to
set
an
example
to
deter
that
conduct
in
the
future.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint
that,
that
conduct
prevented
his
earning
wages
which
he
would
have
earned
otherwise
if
he
had
been
permitted
to
enter
the
plant.
that
was
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
right
to
work.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
on
that
issue
and
that
issue
alone.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
to
that
issue
and
that
alone.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
they
made
motion.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes
that's
right.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that's
right.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that's
right.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
as
i
understood
mr.
goldthwaite
yesterday,
no.
now
that's
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
all
right
the
facts
were
these.
this
plaintiff
was
an
electrician
employed
at
a
copper
plant
(inaudible).
it
has
about
550
employees,
production
employees.
on
the
morning
this
particular
strike
began
which
was
july
the
18th
1951,
the
plaintiff
left
his
home
to
go
to
work.
he
testified
that
he
had
no
knowledge
there
was
to
be
a
strike.
he
took
his
lunch
with
him
as
was
his
custom
to
eat
in
the
plant.
he
got
to
the
vicinity
of
the
plant,
and
saw
a
picket
line
there
of
some
25
or
30
men
walking
in
a
circle
about
three
feet
apart
over
the
entire
travel
portion
of
the
street,
off
to
the
south
side
of
the
street.
immediately
adjacent
to
that
picket
line
there
was
another
group
of
strikers
variously
estimated
at
from
100
to
200
and
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
another
group
estimated
to
be
about
50.
there
were
people
scattered
along
in
the
street.
the
plaintiff
had
to
approach
the
picket
line
slowly
on
account
of
those
small
groups
of
persons
in
the
street.
as
he
neared
the
picket
line
one
of
the
union
members
who
happened
to
be
a
picket
captain
by
the
name
of
hobes
(inaudible)
grabbed
his
automobile
and
was
dragged
by
it
some
10
or
15
to
20
feet.
the
plaintiff
stopped.
the
regional
director
of
this
union
from
atlanta
who
was
there
supervising
the
picketing
and
both
he
was
there,
the
assistant
regional
director,
an
international
representative
from
birmingham,
they
were
all
there
participating
in
the
picketing
and
supervising.
the
regional
director
came
up
to
the
side
of
the
plaintiff's
car
and
said
hourly
or
salary.
now
we
also
had
evidence
of
a
man
that
attended
the
union
meeting
the
day
before
when
they
were
making
the
plans
for
this
strike,
that
this
international
representative
told
them
to
let
the
salaried
employees
in
but
not
to
let
the
hourly
paid
production
employees
through
the
picket
line.
this
regional
director
asked
him
as
i
said
hourly
or
salary.
the
plaintiff
replied
what
difference
does
it
make?
the
regional
director
then
identified
himself
as
being
the
regional
director
and
says
if
you
are
salaried
you
can
go
on
in
if
you
are
hourly
this
is
as
far
as
you
can
go.
the
plaintiff
remained
there
from
an
hour-and-a-half
to
two
hours
there
with
(inaudible),
with
that
picket
line
in
front
of
him
he
tried
to
go
through
it,
each
time
he
did,
they
would
stop
right
in
front
of
his
car
and
point
their
signs
down
towards
his
car.
once
he
tried
to
edge
in
behind
an
empty
bus
going
into
the
plant
to
pick
up
some
third
shift
employees,
and
as
he
did
so,
the
pickets
surged
over
in
front
of
him,
someone
of
them
shouted
it
looks
like
we
are
going
to
have
turn
him
over
to
get
rid
of
him
and
from
that
group
that
was
congregated
at
the
south
side
of
the
picket
line
which
was
constantly
replacing
the
pickets
and
reinforcing
them,
shouts
came
of
turn
him
over.
the
plaintiff
testified
that
there
after
remaining
there
that
length
of
time
he
was
satisfied
that
he
couldn't
get
into
the
plant
without
running
over
somebody
or
else
getting
turned
over,
so
he
backed
out
and
went
home.
now
a
month
later
with
75
alabama
highway
patrolmen
and
20
city
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
the
plant
was
operating
on
a
three
shift
basis.
the
plaintiff
was
on
the
first
shift.
at
the
time
this
was
happening
to
him,
the
third
shift
was
still
in
the
plant
working,
they
were
to
get
off
at
8
o'clock.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
this
was
about
quarter
to
eight.
now
the
foremen
of
the
i
believe
they
called
it
the
production
department,
testified
that
when
he
saw
that
picket
line
outside,
that
he
gave
instructions
to
start
emptying
one
of
the
furnace
in
which
they
carry
142
i
believe
of
these
coupler
pellets,
they
were
heated
to
a
very
high
degree
of
temperature
and
a
pube
extruded
from
it,
and
that
furnace
has
to
be
emptied,
if
the
plant
is
to
close
down.
he
said
that
under
normal
conditions
if
they
were
going
to
shut
the
plant
down
that
they
would
start
emptying
that
furnace
some
time
around
three
or
three-and-a-half
hours
before
the
shutdown.
this
morning
they
started
emptying
that
furnace
at
7:30
in
the
morning
which
was
30
minutes
before
the
first
shift
was
to
get
into
work.
he
also
testified
that
the
draw
benches
and
all
the
machinery
of
the
plant
were
left
in
their
normal
and
customary
condition,
the
same
they
would
be
if
the
plant
was
to
be
operated.
now
the
union
contended
that
they
had
an
agreement
with
the
management
of
the
plant
that
if
they
had
a
strike
the
management
would
not
allow
the
hourly
paid
employees
in
the
plant.
that
was
denied
by
the
management
representative
and
that
was
the
main
question
argued
and
submitted
to
the
jury
and
decided
by
the
jury
and
there
is
no
question
in
this
record
but
what
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
that
basis
to
determine
the
facts
and
that
they
were
bound
to
have
determined
that
force
and
violence
prevented
the
plaintiff
from
earning
wages
and
that
he
would
have
earned
wages
if
he
had
been
able
to
get
in.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
it
seems
they
entered
that
furnace
with
supervisory
employees
and
the
plant
was
--
its
operations
ceased
and
did
not
resume
again
until
a
month
later.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
well,
i
assume
he
did,
the
jury
just
--
it
didn't
itemize
its
verdict,
it
return
a
lump
sum
verdict
for
$10,000,
but
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
he
could
recover
the
wages
that
he
had
lost
during
that
period.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
no.
he
received
no
compensation
during
that
time
he
was
out
of
work,
except
by
way
of
the
verdict
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
no
sir,
it
was
a
lump
sum
verdict
for
$10,000,
could
include
loss
of
wages,
mental
pain
and
suffering
and
punitive
damages,
and
of
course
we
know
about
what
the
loss
of
wages
was,
it
was
about
$500,
so
that
leaves
$9,500
attributable
to
mental
pain
and
anguish
and
punitive
damages.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
no
sir,
just
the
general
verdict
in
return.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
i
believe
that
would
have
showed
that
it
--
the
picket
line
was
maintained
down
from
september
and
they
reopened
in
august,
it
was
a
little
over
a
month,
and
they
continued
to
work
all
during
that
time
with
the
highway
patrol
and
police
protection.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes
sir
and
still
is.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes
sir,
which
was
a
period
of
five
weeks
approximately.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
now,
are
there
any
other
questions
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
as
we
contend
in
our
brief,
we
contend
that
the
laburnum
case
is
controlling
here.
the
conduct
involved
here
was
of
a
similar
nature
to
that
involved
in
to
the
laburnum
case.
it
was
preventing
employees
from
working
by
threats
of
violence.
the
basis
of
the
common
law
tort
action
here
was
the
same
as
the
basis
of
the
common
law
tort
action
involved
in
the
laburnum
case
that
was
interfering
with
the
right
of
a
person
to
engage
in
a
lawful
business
or
occupation
without
interference.
the
unfair
labor
practice
involved
in
the
laburnum
case
was
the
section
8(b)(1)(a)
violation,
the
same
as
it
is
here.
both
cases
were
common
law
tort
actions
having
the
same
foundation
and
involving
the
same
type
of
conduct.
the
defendants
here
claim
that
there
is
a
difference
because
here
the
plaintiff
is
an
employee
and
there
the
plaintiff
was
an
employer.
now
exactly
that
contention
was
advanced
by
counsel
for
laburnum
construction
company
in
that
case.
they
were
claiming
that
there
was
no
preemption
because
the
act
did
not
protect
the
rights
of
an
employee
and
if
the
court
will
examine
the
brief
in
the
laburnum
case,
the
court
will
find
that
it
makes
almost
identically,
the
same
contention
that
the
defendants
make
here
in
trying
to
distinguish
the
laburnum
case,
but
the
court
didn't
accept
that
contention.
instead
it
placed
the
laburnum
case
on
the
border
ground
that
the
taft-hartley
act
did
not
operate
to
abolish
common
law
tort
actions,
that
they
survived,
and
the
court
mentioned
that
in
passing
it,
congress
was
insisting
on
increased
responsibilities
for
labor
organizations,
and
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
intent,
to
say
that
by
implication
and
without
mentioning
it,
they
abolished
common
law
tort
actions
for
damages.
now
as
i
say
i
think
the
laburnum
case
is
controlling,
the
defendant
said
that
laburnum
had
no
remedy,
well
laburnum
did
have
a
remedy.
under
the
statute
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
laburnum
construction
company
in
that
case
could
have
gone
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
have
complained
of
that
conduct
and
obtained
a
cease-and-desist
order
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
requiring
the
labor
organization
to
cease-and-desist
from
that
unlawful
practice.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that's
right
it
did.
it
said
that
there
is
no
compensatory
remedy
provided
by
the
labor
management
relations
act
except
i
believe
the
wording
was
in
such
manner
supplementary
ways
as
reinstatement
with
back
pay.
now
i'm
going
to
discuss
that
feature
of
the
laburnum
case
in
just
a
few
minutes.
before
i
get
to
that,
i
want
to
mention
the
kohler
case
and
the
case
of
youngdahl
against
rainfair
which
the
court
decided
this
week.
they
hold,
the
kohler
case
in
considerable
detail
that
congress
intended
to
leave
to
the
states,
the
matter
of
controlling
and
preventing
of
violence
in
labor
relations
matters.
the
kohler
case
went
so
far
as
to
hold
that
the
wisconsin
board
and
the
wisconsin
courts
could
grant
remedy,
a
preventive
remedy
that
would
duplicate
that
the
board
grants
or
could
grant
rather.
so
they
established
without
any
controversy
that,
that
power
is
still
inherent
in
the
states
that
is
the
power
the
control
force
and
violence
in
labor
relations
matters.
now,
i
think
this
action
can
be
justified
under
that
theory,
that
is
under
the
power
of
the
state
to
control
force
and
violence.
i'm
afraid
that
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
douglas
will
not
agree
on
this
theory
that
i've
advanced
now
in
view
of
that
dissent
in
the
rainfair
case
and
in
the
kohler
case,
but
the
kohler
case
establishes
as
i
said
that
the
state
does
have
power
to
prevent
force
and
violence.
let's
think
of
the
ways
in
which
they
can
do
it.
of
course
the
most
obvious
way
is
on
the
spot
police
protection;
that
is
as
was
done
in
this
case
by
the
alabama
highway
patrolmen
and
the
city
policemen
that
were
there.
then
the
next
way
that
the
state
can
do
it
is
by
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
unlawful
conduct,
such
as
was
granted
in
the
kohler
case
and
such
as
was
granted
and
sustained
in
the
rainfair
case.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
metamora
dairies
case,
a
state
can
places
confidence
in
a
chancellor's
decree
rather
than
in
a
policemen's
club.
so
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
as
well
as
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
can
place
its
confidence
in
chancellor's
decree
and
an
injunction
properly
framed.
now
another
way
that
the
state
can
prevent
force
and
violence
in
such
matters
is
by
criminal
prosection.
in
alabama
we
have
a
criminal
statute
providing
that
it's
a
misdemeanor
for
any
person
or
group
of
persons
to
assemble
at
or
near
the
entrance
of
a
place
of
business
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
anyone
from
engaging
in
a
lawful
occupation
by
force
and
violence.
i
think
a
number
of
states
have
similar
laws,
i
know
the
arkansas
statute
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
cole
against
arkansas,
338
u.s.
345,
made
it
a
felony
for
two
or
more
persons
to
conspire
to
use
force
or
violence
to
prevent
employees
from
working,
and
this
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute,
as
i
say
it
made
it
a
felony.
well
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
makes
it
clear
that
congress
intended
that
the
states
retain
that
power.
now
a
criminal
prosecution
of
course
is
--
serves
or
it
operates
in
two
ways;
first
it's
for
punishment
and
second
it's
to
set
an
example,
so
as
to
prevent
that
unlawful
conduct
in
the
future.
now
accumulative
damages
operate
in
the
same
way
under
our
law
and
i
think
it's
the
law
of
practically
all
of
the
states,
that
allow
punitive
damages,
they
serve
a
two-fold
purpose;
one
punishment,
two
to
set
an
example,
to
deter
similar
conduct
in
the
future.
so
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
state
has
judicial
power
to
allow
the
maintenance
of
an
action
such
as
this
with
the
recovery
of
punitive
damages,
for
punishment
and
to
set
that
example
in
order
to
prevent
that
type
of
conduct
and
i
submit
this.
it's
a
much
more
effective
preventive
remedy
than
a
criminal
prosecution
of
several
hundred
persons
for
misdemeanor.
so
we
submit
that
under
that
power
of
the
states
that
this
action
can
be
maintained.
on
that
punitive
damages
there
is
one
case
decided
by
this
court
that
i
didn't
cite
in
my
brief,
i
probably
should
have.
in
alabama
under
lord
campbell's
act
otherwise
known
as
the
alabama
homicide
act
the
only
damages
recoverable
are
punitive
damages
and
no
compensatory
damages
are
recoverable
on
their
law
in
a
civil
action
for
wrongful
death,
but
it's
solely
punitive.
in
1927
that
statute
was
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
louis
pizitz
dry
goods
company,
inc.
versus
yeldell
274
u.s.
112.
it
was
claimed
that
that
statute
violated
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
justice
stone
held
otherwise
and
said
that
the
punitive
damage
was
reasonably
related
to
preventing
homicide
and
that
the
legislature
of
alabama
had
the
right
to
attempt
to
prevent
homicide
by
making
it
expensive.
we
say
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
the
right
to
prevent
mass
picketing
and
forcing
violence
by
making
it
expensive
as
well
as
the
right
to
prohibit
it
by
its
criminal
laws
and
by
its
police
officers
and
by
the
injunctive
powers
of
the
court.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
is
it
reviewable?
mr.
norman
w.
harris
oh
yes.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
it
is
reviewable
your
honor
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
before
the
trial
judge.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
oh
yes
and
this
one
was
in
this
case.
it
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
filed
and
argued
and
passed
on
by
the
trial
judge
and
one
of
the
grounds
of
it
was
that
the
verdict
was
excessive.
that
same
argument
was
advanced
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
was
passed
on,
you
will
find
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
since
the
purpose
of
punitive
damages
is
punishment
and
prevention
and
since
its
discretionary
with
the
jury,
then
the
court
can't
say
that
too
much
was
allowed
that
it's
within
the
reasonable
discretion
of
the
jury
to
say
how
much
is
necessary
to
prevent
certain
types
of
conduct.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
well
i
don't
know
what
the
court,
what
the
circuit
judge
would
have
gone
in
that
event.
i
might
say
it's
mentioned
in
the
petitioner
brief,
it's
out
of
the
record
but
in
one
of
these
cases
we
got
a
verdict
for
$18,450
that's
the
biggest
one
we've
got.
and
the
trial
judge
in
that
opinion
said
that
he
thought
the
jury
had
been
exceeding
the
liberal,
but
he
couldn't
say
that
it
had
been
actuated
by
improper
motives.
now
i
thought
that
he
would
have
approved
any
more
than
that
because
he
didn't
seem
to
be
too
sure
of
that.
now
to
me
the
most
difficult
question
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
power
of
the
national
labor
relations
board?
the
petitioners
contend
that
they
have
power
to
require
the
union
to
reimburse
russell
for
the
wages
that
he
lost.
i
don't
know
whether
they
contend
that
they
had
power
to
compensate
him
for
the
mental
anguish
he
suffered
on
that,
they
haven't
said
so.
but
certainly
that
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
power
of
the
board
and
the
ordinary
concept
of
that
power.
the
basis
of
the
power
of
the
board
of
course
is
in
the
language
of
the
act
that
it
shall
have
power
to
require
of
a
person
to
take
such
affirmative
action
as
may
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
act.
i
believe
that's
the
language
of
the
statute.
now
petitioners
claim
that
it
would
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
act
to
require
the
union
to
reimburse
the
man
for
the
wages
he
lost.
the
board
has
held
in
at
least
four
and
i
believe
more
cases
that
we
cite
in
a
footnote,
footnote
23
on
the
bottom
of
page
47
of
that
brief
that
that
they
do
not
have
that
power,
that
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
have
that
power.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that's
right,
that's
what
they
hold
and
they
mention
the
fact
that
under
the
1935
act
that
it
was
held
that
they
had
the
power
to
require
the
employer
to
pay
back
pay
and
that
when
the
act
was
amended
in
1947
that
it
used
exactly
the
same
language,
but
added
the
proviso
that
the
board
had
power
to
require
labor
organization
to
pay
back
pay
in
cases
of
discrimination.
and
they
said
that
adopting
the
language
of
the
35
act
and
adding
that
one
thing
showed
that
there
was
not
a
congressional
intent
to
give
that
power.
now
i
say
that
there
is
more
evidence
of
congressional
intent
that
the
board
not
have
that
power
than
appears
from
the
language
of
the
act
and
that
is
from
what
was
said
when
this
amendment
was
being
considered
in
the
senate.
we
quote
in
our
brief
one
illustration
senator
taft
gave.
he
was
asked
by
one
of
the
senators
what
procedure
the
board
would
adopt
on
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8(b)(1)
and
i
read
from
what
senator
taft
said,
it's
set
out
at
the
beginning
at
the
bottom
49
of
my
brief.
he
said
this,
“there
will
be
a
hearing
as
to
why
they
were
doing
these
things
and
a
cease-and-desist
order
maybe
issued.
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
other
penalty.
if
they
should
disobey
the
cease-and-desist
order,
the
board
can
obtain
an
injunction
and
if
they
violate
the
injunction
they
are
liable
for
contempt.
that
is
the
only
result”
and
i
emphasis
on
it,
that
is
the
only
result
of
this
general
charge
of
unfair
labor
practices.
now
i
have
another
instance
during
the
debate
on
that,
senator
taft
illustrated
by
supposing
a
case
of
mass
picketing
and
he
again
mentions
mass
picketing
that
keeps
office
personnel
out
of
the
plant
and
he
says
that
the
board
can
call
the
union
before
it
and
issue
a
cease-and-desist
order,
but
that
is
the
only
consequence.
i
believe
that
with
senator
taft's
knowledge
of
this
situation
and
with
his
candor
and
frankness
that
if
there
had
been
any
intention
on
the
part
of
the
senate
to
give
the
board
that
power
that
he
would
have
so
answered
in
response
to
those
inquiries.
i
think
secondly
that
it
was
never
in
his
thought
that
board
was
being
given
that
type
of
power.
now
another
indication
is
that
when
they
were
discussing
section
303
of
the
act
which
is
the
provision
i
believe
allowing
for
secondary
boycotts.
senator
taft
says
that
it
was
discussed
giving
that
power
to
the
board,
rather
than
for
providing
actions
of
law
to
recover
damages,
the
secondary
boycotts,
but
he
said
no
one
either
side
of
the
question
thought
that
the
board
was
a
proper
agency
to
have
power
to
grant
damages
in
a
case
like
that.
so
i
believe
that
the
congressional
intent
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
congressional
intent
was
that
the
board
would
not
have
power
in
such
cases
like
this.
there
is
another
very
strong
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
leave
that
matter
to
court
and
that
is
this.
my
friend
mr.
goldthwaite
has
mentioned
that
in
the
house
bill
which
was
known
hr
3020
section
12
(a)
of
that
bill
authorized
or
provided
rather
that
it
was
an
unlawful
concerted
activity
for
a
labor
union
by
force
or
violence
to
prevent
anyone
from
entering
his
place
of
employment.
subdivision
(b)
of
section
12
of
that
bill
expressively
provided
that
anyone
injured
by
such
an
unlawful
concerted
activity
would
have
the
right
to
maintain
a
suit
for
damages
in
the
united
states
district
court
without
regard
to
the
amount
in
controversy
or
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
now
that
was
the
house
treatment
of
the
matter.
when
the
senate
disagreed
and
the
matter
got
to
the
conference
committee,
they
adopted
the
senate
version
of
the
bill.
they
dropped
section
12
of
the
house
bill.
they
explained
why
that
was
done
and
in
the
explanation,
that
is
in
the
house
conference
report,
in
house
conference
report
of
510
on
page
42.
it
mentions
the
fact
under
the
house
bill
suits
could
be
brought
to
recover
damages
and
--
in
a
case
such
as
this,
and
then
he
says
that
the
conference
agreement
did
not
take
the
--
did
not
deal
with
the
matter
in
the
same
way
the
house
bill
was,
but
what
they
are
saying
in
here
is
that
while
they
didn't
do
it
in
exactly
the
same
way,
the
effect
of
what
they
did
was
the
same
and
here
is
what
they
say
on
this
and
i
think
this
is
very
pertinent,
the
conference
agreement
while
adopting
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
i
am
reading
from
page
35
of
my
brief
and
it's
a
part
of
the
conference
report.
after
referring
to
the
treatment
of
such
activities
in
section
12
of
the
house
bill,
the
report
says
this.
and
this
is
near
the
bottom
of
page
35
of
my
brief.
the
conference
agreement
while
adopting
section
8(b)(1)
of
senate
amendment
does
not
by
specific
terms
contain
any
of
these
sanctions,
but
an
employee
who
is
discharged
for
participating
in
them
will
not,
as
explained
in
the
discussion
of
the
section
7,
be
entitled
to
reinstatement.
now
here
is
the
crux
of
the
situation
as
i
see
it.
furthermore
in
section
302(b)
unions
are
made
suable,
unions
that
engage
in
these
practices
to
the
injury
of
another
may
subject
themselves
to
liability
under
ordinary
principles
of
law.
well
ordinary
principle
of
law
is
bound
to
be
the
common
law.
now
the
report
is
an
error
in
referring
to
section
302(b)
because
302(b)
dealt
with
payments
to
agents
of
labor
organizations
by
employers.
i
think
what
they
meant
was
section
301(b).
it
happened
that
302(b)
was
the
corresponding
provision
in
the
house
bill
and
i
think
the
(inaudible)
has
confused
on
the
section,
but
whether
that
is
material
or
not
at
least
what
they
are
saying
is
then
since
unions
are
suable,
they
can
be
subjected
to
liability
for
common
law
torts
such
as
this
under
ordinary
principles
of
law
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
shows
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
that
actions
such
as
these
survive.
now
my
adversary
in
his
reply
brief
says
that
statement
of
the
conference
report
i
just
read
as
meaningless
because
of
the
reference
to
302(b),
and
says
that
301
of
the
act
has
reference
to
suits
against
labor
organizations
for
violation
of
contracts.
that's
true
of
section
301(a)
but
the
conference
report
shows
that
the
rest
of
section
301
of
the
act
was
of
general
application.
in
the
legislative
history
set
out
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
in
the
textile
workers
union
case
against
lincoln
mills
of
alabama
a
part
of
the
conference
committee
report
reads
as
follows,
talking
about
section
301
of
the
conference
committee
bill,
“this
subsection
and
the
succeeding
sub
sections
of
the
section
301
of
the
conference
agreement
are
generally
in
their
application
as
distinguished
from
sub
section
(a),
they
are
general
in
their
application.
bearing
that
out
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
that
dissent,
and
this
is
from
page
933
of
77
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
statement
in
section
301(b)
that
the
acts
of
the
agent
of
the
union
are
to
be
regarded
as
binding
upon
the
union
maybe
used
in
support
of
this
conclusion.
this
provision
not
confined
in
its
application
to
suits
in
the
district
court
under
section
301(a)
was
primarily
directed
to
responsibility
of
the
union
for
its
agents
actions
in
authorizing
strikes
or
committing
torts,
recognizing
that
the
other
provisions
of
section
301,
the
provision
rather
than
(a),
are
of
general
application.
now
going
back
to
the
laburnum
case,
it
was
pointed
out
there
that
there
was
no
compensatory
remedy
for
the
laburnum
construction
corporation
provided
by
the
act.
now
if
the
words
giving
the
board
power
to
require
a
person
to
take
such
a
affirmative
action
as
well
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
can
be
construed
broadly
enough
to
say
that
the
board
had
power
to
require
the
union
to
compensate
this
plaintiff,
for
his
loss
of
wages
and
for
his
mental
suffering.
then
by
the
same
token
in
the
laburnum
case,
when
the
laburnum
construction
corporation
went
to
the
board
and
asked
that
the
union
be
restrained
from
preventing
their
employees
from
working,
the
board
then
could
require
the
union
to
take
affirmative
action
by
paying
laburnum
the
damages
they
had
sustained,
but
the
court
didn't
seem
to
think
that
board
had
such
power
and
said,
that
it
had
compensatory
power
and
only
minor
supplementary
wages.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
your
honor
–-
mr.
norman
w.
harris
but
just
back
pay,
frankly
my
position
would
be
considerably
weakened.
i
don't
think
it
would
--
i
don't
think
it
would
be
foreclosed,
but
it
would
be
weakened.
i
must
confess
that
it
might
be
said
out
there
if
the
board
had
that
power
that
was
all
congress
intent,
that's
all
the
wrote,
but
now
there
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
the
answer
i
have
for
that
goes
back
to
what
i
have
been
arguing
that
congress
intended
that
common
law
of
tort
action
survives.
now
–
and
in
that
connection
i
want
to
mention
a
line
of
cases
that
i
probably
should
have,
but
haven't
mentioned
in
my
brief.
they
are
referred
to
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
its
original
consideration
of
this
jurisdictional
question
in
53
and
that
line
of
cases
are
the
ones
dealing
with
railway
labor
act,
moore
against
illinois
central
railway
and
slocum
against
delaware,
and
lackawanna
railway
company.
as
i
read
those
cases,
the
injured
party
has
an
election
as
to
whether
he
will
proceed
before
the
board
or
whether
he
would
proceed
in
a
court
and
here
is
what
was
said
in
the
slocum
against
delaware
and
lackawanna
railway
company
case
which
is
quoted
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
i'll
read
from
page
6,
7,
and
8
of
the
record.
“our
holding
here
is
not
inconsistent
with
our
holding
in
moore
against
illinois
central
railroad
company.
moore
was
discharged
by
the
railroad.
he
could
have
challenged
the
validity
of
his
discharge
before
the
board,
seeking
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
instead
he
chose
to
accept
the
railroad's
action
in
discharging
him
as
final,
thereby
ceasing
to
be
an
employee,
and
brought
suit
claiming
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
as
we
there
held,
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
bar
courts
from
adjudicating
such
cases.
a
common-law
or
statutory
action
for
wrongful
discharge
differs
from
any
remedy
which
the
board
has
power
to
provide,
and
does
not
involve
questions
of
future
relations
between
the
railroad
and
its
other
employees.”
now
the
effect
of
that
is
that
a
railroad
worker
who
is
discharged
can
go
for
the
board
and
seek
the
reinstatement
and
back
pay
or
he
can
file
a
suit
for
damages
for
wrongful
discharge.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
no
sir,
you
have
to
have
some
actual
damage
in
order
to
recover
anything.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
while
your
–-
mr.
norman
w.
harris
well
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
complaint
of
that
kind
would
be
demurer
because
under
our
law
there
has
to
be
actual
damage
on
which
to
hitch
a
claim
for
punitive
damage.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
i
haven't
thought
of
that
but
i
believe
it
would
have
to
be
on
item
of
damages
that
were
recoverable.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
now
there
is
a
possibility,
i
don't
know
this
but
i
think
there's
line
of
case
is
holding
that
where
a
wrong
is
intentional
and
a
person
sustains
mental
anguish
that
he
can
recover
that
alone.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
well
i
am
sorry
i
haven't
thought
about
it.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
now
let
me
say
one
other
thing
and
i
think
i
will
be
through.
after
all
this
thing
boils
down
to
what
did
congress
intend,
that's
the
essence
of
the
case
and
suppose
there
is
a
remedy
with
the
board
it's
entirely
discretionary
with
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
in
the
first
place
whether
or
not
he
would
file
a
compliant
--
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that's
right,
but
here
is
what
i
was
going
to
illustrate.
it's
discretionary
with
the
general
counsel
as
to
whether
he
will
file
a
compliant.
it's
discretionary
with
the
board
as
i
understand
the
case
of
guss
against
utah
labor
relations
board
as
to
what
fields
it
will
take
jurisdiction
of.
now
i
say
that
congress
had
no
intention
of
substituting
such
a
doubtful
dubious
remedy
for
a
common
law
right
which
a
man
had
to
sustain
to
recover
damages
that
he
had
sustained
as
result
of
the
intentional
wrongful,
forceful
and
violent
conduct.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
that
i
think
they
did
in
that
conference
report.
well
because
the
house
bill
now
they
might
not
have
thought
this
particular
case
i
don't
know
whether
they
talked
that.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
but
the
house
bill
it
had
language
which
specifically
covered
this
case
just
like
(inaudible)
and
the
conference
committee
report
comes
along
and
says
while
we
are
not
using
exactly
that
method
of
treatment,
we
have
accomplished
the
same
result
by
the
conference
committee
bill
then
they
certainly
intended
to
preserve
these
common
law
actions.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
there
is
one
other
case
of
a
court
of
appeals
on
the
power
of
the
board
to
award
back
pay
and
not
past
in
the
list,
but
i
think
in
the
case
of
international
union,
united
automobile
workers
the
same
union
against
hinz
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
218
f.
2nd
664,
i
believe
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
the
board
had
no
such
problem.
mr.
norman
w.
harris
yes.
there
is
a
very
excellent
discussion
by
the
board
in
national
maritime
case
in
78
nlrb,
it's
cited
in

mr.
norman
w.

mr.
norman
w.

yes
sir,
it's
