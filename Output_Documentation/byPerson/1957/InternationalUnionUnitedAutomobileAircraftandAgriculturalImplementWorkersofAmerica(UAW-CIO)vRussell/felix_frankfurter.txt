justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
restating
the
last
thing
that
you
said
about
judicial
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
--
i
just
didn't
take
it
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
putting
that
in
your
own
words
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
a
judicial
right
based
on
an
exercise
of
the
police
power
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
a
state
gives
damages
so
this
is
a
bad
thing
to
do
with
the
society
and
anybody
who
doesn't
and
somebody
is
injured
should
sue
for
treble
damages,
it's
all
right.
can
you
talk
to
me
in
--
i'm
glad
to
get
some
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
relieves
me
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
gathered
from
what
you
say
--
do
i
gather
correctly
that
this
is
what
you
state
to
the
court
that
the
others
strike
confusedly
legal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
strike
was
sort
to
be
have
made
effective
by
picketing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
as
a
result
of
the
picketing,
the
plaintiff
russell
was
out
of
a
job
and
couldn't
get
to
his
place
of
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
picketing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
says
that
the
--
of
the
strike
and
it
was
enforced,
it
was
made
effective
by
picketing,
the
picketing
kept
them
away
from
his
bench
or
whatever
it
was
and
he
now
sues
for
damages
because
he
wasn't
allowed
to
work
all
day.
is
that
what
you're
saying
the
case
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
more
than
that
mr.
goldthwaite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
say
that
there
is
--
all
there
is
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
on
the
facts,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
he
contended,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
--
i'd
like
to
get
this
clear.
you're
very
clear
but
perhaps
too
clear,
that
he
can
--
are
you
saying
that
you're
here
to
contest
against
a
cause
of
action
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
strike,
there
were
pickets,
effective
pickets
to
prevent
people
from
getting
to
work
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
suit
was
one
of
these
people
and
for
four
weeks,
he
was
out
of
pocket
because
he
couldn't
earn
his
--
the
wages
he
would
have
earned
during
those
five
weeks.
is
that
what
you
say
you
are
arguing
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
the
case
you
have
to
demolish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
your
--
if
you
don't
mind
if
i'm
breaking
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
happen
to
talk
from
notes
anyhow.
you're
too
--
you're
too
easy
on
your
feet
that
it
require
notes.
but
as
you
state
the
case
if
i
may
say
so
to
me
at
least
it
seems
so
simple
that
i'm
suspicious
of
the
simplicity
to
which
you
reduce
this
case.
there
must
be
in
this
case
an
element
which
the
other
side
in
your
cost
--
i
don
t
--
i've
looked
at
the
brief
--
i
looked
at
the
brief
and
i
don't
know
what's
in
it
and
i
don't
want
it.
that's
what
arguing
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
must
be
an
element
that
what
was
done
here
exceeded
the
protective
right
guaranteed
by
federal
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
come
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
vital
part.
i
can't
imagine
that
any
court
in
this
land
would
say
that
conceded
--
concededly
concerted
activity
by
employee
in
enforcing
a
strike
which
they
have
a
right
to
engage
it
under
the
federal
act
is
nevertheless
subject
to
a
state
suit
for
damages
because
if
these
pickets
weren't
there,
they
could
go
to
work.
that's
too
simple
at
least
to
my
mind
so
there
must
be
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
coconut.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
jury
can't
sit
in
judgment
and
what
congress
has
withdrawn
from
the
whole
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
didn't
you
sit
down
because
that
seems
to
me
obvious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
mean
you
should
sit
down.
all
i'm
saying
is
if
that's
the
case,
there's
nothing
more
to
argue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
total
amount
of
his
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wage
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
total
amount
of
his
loss
of
wages
as
compared
to
the
$10,000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
question
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
amount
of
the
damages
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
before
us
here?
is
that
a
federal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
why
do
we
discuss
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
be
glad
--
i
do
will
be
glad
to
listen
to
your
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
anybody
disagree
with
--
does
anybody
disagree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
anybody
disagree
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
argue
ourselves
have
it
in
conclusive
proposition?
it
doesn't
get
us
anywhere
to
say
that
that
which
is
withdrawn
from
the
state
is
withdrawn
from
the
state.
everybody
agrees
to
that.
the
problem
is
whether
this
is
withdrawn?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
should
talk
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
implying
that
if
the
jury's
verdict
had
been
$1,000;
that
would
not
have
raised
the
federal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
$10,000
would
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
10000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
can
clarify?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
wouldn't
be
any,
but
it
didn't,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
(inaudible)
time
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
be
no
federal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
your
federal
question
is
merely
a
question
of
preemption,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
still
don't
see
what
the
question
of
damages
has
to
do
with
it,
except
as
you
just
indicated,
illustrative,
if
the
state
can
do
this,
if
the
state
has
power,
a
jury
can
bring
in
a
verdict
for
$1,000
or
$10,000,
but
the
fact
of
$10,000
is
immaterial
to
the
federal
issue,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
in
or
itself
raise
the
federal
question,
that's
the
short
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
a
claim
the
amount
is
so
excessive
that
it's
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means
because
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can't
understand
this
case
without
knowing
what
the
facts
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
--
i'll
leave
you
to
decide
that,
but
i
don't
see
that
we've
got
an
abstract
issue
here,
have
we?
i
mean
in
generalizing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
will
tell
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
goes
to
the
damages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
stated,
the
cause
of
action
was
the
employment
of
force
and
violence
to
interfere
with
his
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
attempt
to
go
to
work.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
the
case
go
to
trial
on
that
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
issue
directed,
was
the
evidence
directed
to
that
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
defendant
ask
that
the
case
be
dismissed
for
want
of
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
force
and
violence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
overruled
it
and
said
there
was
evidence
of
force
or
violence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
jury
found
that
there
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
was
a
motion
to
set
it
aside?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
went
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
they
sustained
the
findings
of
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
there
any
--
is
there
a
controversy
here
now
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
of
force
and
violence
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
--
your
answer
to
me
carries
the
statement,
that
mr.
goldthwaite,
or
that
the
petitioner
here
admits
that
there
was
an
issue
of
force
and
violence
which
interfered
with
the
plaintiff,
to
his
loss
monetarily
determinable,
that
there
was
evidence
of
that
to
go
to
the
jury.
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
that
despite
that
which
is
controlling
here,
if
there
is
evidence,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question
if
i
may
mr.
harris?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
alabama
law
can
you
bring
a
cause
of
action
in
a
situation
like
this,
forget
about
ad
hoc
for
the
moment,
can
you
bring
a
cause
of
action
solely
for
punitive
damage
or
a
punitive
damages
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
saying
you
may
not
--
didn't
require
to
be
some
action,
my
question
was
whether
he
could
be
bring
a
suit
merely
lay
the
ad
damnum,
allege
actual
damage
â€“-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
depravation
of
wages,
would
you
bring
the
suit,
the
ad
damnum
would
really
be
for
the
punitive
damages.
let
me
put
to
you
my
whole
--
the
question
in
my
mind.
you
answered
chief
justice
that
your
answer
would
be
that
common
law
tort
action
survived
to
have
tort
damage.
i
suppose
one
would
--
in
construing
these
materials
but
they
are
not
easy,
the
legislative
statutory
materials,
the
common
law
of
the
state
et
cetera,
if
those
were
to
hold
that
congress
in
disagreement
with
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
case
to
which
justice
harlem
referred,
suppose
one
were
to
hold
that
in
fact
the
court
--
the
board
could
give
relief
against
a
union
by
an
employee
and
not
merely
where
it
settled
everything
(inaudible)
back
pay
against
employer,
suppose
in
other
words
your
client
could
have
gone
or
could
go,
putting
the
statute
of
limitation
there,
to
the
board
for
back
pay,
under
alabama
law
could
that
be
split
up
assuming
the
statute
would
allow,
so
that
he
could,
since
he
could
go
to
the
board
for
back
pay,
congress
has
preempted
that
relief
in
the
state
court,
could
he
under
state
law,
never
mind
federal
law
we
have
to
decide
that,
say
i
want
punitive
damages
for
the
tort
for
which
the
board
patently
cannot
give
relief?
have
i
put
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
your
answer
to
chief
justice
was
that
either
you
can,
you
have
the
choice
of
going
to
the
board
or
going
to
the
court,
both
for
back
pay
and
for
punitive
debt
and
tort
recovery.
assuming
that
you
can't
get
tort
recovery
before
the
board
as
i
assume
because
that's
what
laburnum
to
me
presupposed,
assuming
that
you
cannot
go
to
the
board
ask
a
tort
action
but
can
go
to
the
board
for
back
pay,
and
then
you
go
to
the
board
for
back
pay
and
go
to
the
state
court
for
the
tort
restricted
to
the
punitive
amount
which
the
state
allows?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
i
were
a
pleader,
i
could
draw
such
a
complaint
because
i
would
say
i
had
actual
damages
for
which
the
board
is
giving
me
the
relief
that
the
board
is
giving
me
relief
for
the
tort
consequences
for
those
i
go
to
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that
sounds
like
to
sense
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
that
some
of
these
questions
may
come
to
the
circuits
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
have
to
reach
the
question
and
decide
against
you
on
the
recoverability
against
back
pay
as
against
existing
laws
abide
the
board
and
lower
courts
have
declared
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
help
me
any
because
it's
all
discretionary
as
to
an
injection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
harris,
it's
just
confidential,
do
you
think
the
congress
thought
about
these
problems
we
have
been
discussing
for
the
few
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
these
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
board
been
consistent
about
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
23
of
your
brief
mr.
harris?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
page
47,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
here
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
we
have
to
choose
one
or
the
other?
just
as
merely
because
of
--
there
is
violence
it
doesn't
preclude
peaceful
activity
so
because
those
peaceful
activities
doesn't
prohibit
the
inhibition,
the
prohibition
of
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
it
open
the
door
(inaudible)
to
establishing
the
fact
that
there
was
violence
in
a
state
court
and
if
that
is
established,
that
damages
maybe
assessed
by
the
state
court
according
to
its
local
procedure
and
measure
--
and
laws
of
damage
whether
punitive
or
not,
some
states
have
(inaudible),
doesn't
it
--
if
there
is
violence
open
the
door
to
a
cause
of
action
on
the
basis
of
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
in
laburnum
it
is,
is
laburnum
an
emergency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
back
pay
as
you
urge.
