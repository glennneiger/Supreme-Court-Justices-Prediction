where
was
this
last
correction,
at
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
facts
are
as
you
conceive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
to
the
month
later,
what
happened
in
the
plant,
there
was
a
plant
operating
this
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
time
was
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
happen
so
far
as
the
operation
of
the
plant
was
concerned
thereafter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
he
get
damages
or
did
he
get
wages
for
this
month?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
plant
was
closed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
did
the
strike
last
after
they
opened,
reopened
the
plant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
this
man
work
during
that
period,
from
june
--
whatever
day
it
was
that
the
plant
reopened
until
the
strike
was
over?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
only
wages
that
he
was
entitled
to
under
this
verdict
would
have
been
the
wages
that
he
would
have
earned
while
the
plant
was
closed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
i
think
that's
sufficient.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
laburnum
point
out
that
there
was
no
remedy
to
the
employer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
have
an
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was

please.
