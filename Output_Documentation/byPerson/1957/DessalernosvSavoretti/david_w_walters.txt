mr.
david
w.
walters
honorable
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
whom
i
represent,
presents
this
court
with
what
i
believe
to
be
legal
issue
that
is
very
narrow,
it
involves
the
construction
of
a
statute.
the
statute
particularly
is
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
a
section
of
it,
section
244
(a)
and
the
various
subsections
there
under.
the
petitioner
is
an
alien.
he's
a
native
and
citizen
of
greece.
he
entered
the
united
states
in
march
of
1947
as
a
seaman.
his
entry
was
legal
but
he's
thereafter
remained
beyond
the
period
of
time
for
which
he
was
admitted.
he's
been
here
ever
since.
in
the
course
of
a
--
in
administration
deportation
proceeding,
he
presented
to
the
special
inquiry
officer
an
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
which
is
a
device
established
by
congress
in
1940
to
and
particular
hardship
cases
to
alleviate
deportation
and
permit
an
adjustment
of
status.
later
in
1948,
this
device
was
extended
in
july
the
1st,
1948
and
with
the
advent
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
it
was
extended
and
broadened
and
in
that
particular
act
for
the
first
time
included
the
extension
of
relief
from
deportation
to
people
of
the
criminal
and
on
moral
classes.
the
petitioner
however,
does
not
fall
within
any
of
those
classes.
what
the
petitioners
sought
in
connection
with
this
hearing
and
which
was
permitted
by
congress.
apparently,
congress,
it
was
believed
with
numerous
and
many
appropriations
or
petitions
by
persons
for
relief
from
deportation.
the
laws
prior
to
the
enactments
that
i
spoke
of
did
not
provide
for
any
such
relief.
therefore,
congress
did
give
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
the
discretion
to
recommend
and
give
suspension
of
deportation
to
certain
classes
of
aliens
who
suffered
particular
hardship.
the
petitioner
did
make
such
an
application.
the
special
inquiry
officer
in
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
said
that
he
did
not
qualify
statutorily
and
for
that
reason,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
could
not
exercise
the
discretion
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
given
him.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
this
particular
section
and
other
sections
pertaining
to
suspension
deportation
had
established
certain
statutory
requirements,
which
had
to
be
met
prior
to
the
invocation
of
the
discretion.
now,
section
244
(a)
does
provide
that
the
attorney
general
under
certain
circumstances
may
invoke
this
discretion
and
then
it
proceeds
to
give
five
separate
and
distinct
categories
or
subsections.
each
of
which
is
separated
by
the
word
“or.”
the
first
category
is
separate
and
distinct
from
every
other
category.
now,
in
the
course
of
the
deportation
hearing,
the
hearing
examiner
determine
and
did
lies
to
the
second
deportation
charge
in
addition
to
the
charge
that
the
man
had
entered
the
united
states
remained
illegally.
the
charge
that
he
had
failed
to
report
in
january
of
1953
and
1954
is
required
by
law.
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
the
act
does
contain
a
charge
that
anybody
who
fails
to
so
comply
willfully
is
subject
to
deportation.
section
244
(a)
(5)
if
the
relief
provision
and
suspension
of
deportation
does
contain
therein
a
portion
which
said
that
people
who
have
committed
such
an
act
may
receive
the
privilege
of
suspension
of
deportation
under
certain
circumstances.
now,
the
problem
is
this
and
the
court
below
recognized
that
this
man
did
qualify
under
the
statutory
provisions
of
section
244
(a)
(1),
if
the
statutory
provisions
of
section
244
(a)
(5)
were
to
apply,
he
would
not
qualify
if
they
were
to
apply.
our
position
--
that
having
qualified
under
one,
he
need
not
qualify
under
two
or
more
of
the
same
subsections.
mr.
david
w.
walters
under
(5),
your
honor,
the
government
urged
that
in
as
much
as
he
had
been
found
deportable
on
the
ground
that
he
had
fail
to
notify
his
change
of
address
in
1953
and
1954,
that
he
would
have
to,
therefore
have
ten
years
of
residence
after
having
attained
the
status.
a
--
a
qualification
which
he
did
not
posses
--
mr.
david
w.
walters
we
conceive
that
he
does
not
qualify
under
five
but
we
do
not
conceive
that
he
--
that
the
fact
does
not
prevent
him
or
does
prevent
him
from
qualifying
under
(1)
and
therefore
he's
entitled
to
invocation
or
at
least
the
consideration
of
attorney
general
of
his
application.
mr.
david
w.
walters
failure
to
report
is
not
a
consideration
under
(1).
mr.
david
w.
walters
your
honor,
that's
the
first
time
that's
come
up
in
the
course
of
district
court
proceedings
or
the
circuit
court
proceedings
and
it
only
come
up
in
connection
with
this
brief.
i'm
prepared
to
answer
that.
an
examination
of
the
record
was
showed
that
the
court
did
make
an
adjudication
that
he
did
qualify.
there
is
stipulation
that
he
did
qualify
under
(1).
now,
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
there
was
a
summary
dismissal
of
his
application.
he
was
not
given
a
full
opportunity
to
present
evidence
of
his
qualifications,
he
was
not
in
a
complete
opportunity
to
present
all
qualifications
or
have
the
adequately
considered.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
summarily
dismissed
that
both
times,
the
crux
was
that
he
was
not
eligible
under
section
240
(a)
(5)
and
therefore
he
couldn't
be
eligible
under
section
244
(a)
(1)
and
he
failed
to
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
mr.
david
w.
walters
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
walters
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
david
w.
walters
not
only
the
opportunity
completely
show
this
but
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
didn't
give
a
consideration
in
their
decision.
it
doesn't
show
any
detailed
consideration
of
other
qualifications
other
--
in
the
statement
that
he
was
statutorily
ineligible
among
other
things
that
it
said
but
it
didn't
give
any
detailed
consideration
because
other
things
are
also
concluded
in
section
244
(a)
(5).
mr.
david
w.
walters
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
so.
however,
they
say
that
the
matters
come
up
in
this
court
and
has
never
come
up
in
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
walters
the
stipulation,
your
honor
is
in
the
record
and
reference
was
made
to
it
in
government's
brief.
mr.
david
w.
walters
yes,
sir
and
this
was
accomplished
by
--
by
means
of
summary
judgment,
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
david
w.
walters
but
there's
a
second
stipulation
on
which
the
court
made
its
decision
and
the
court's
decision
was
this,
at
page
34
--
mr.
david
w.
walters
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
walters
does
the
fact
--
and
this
with
the
issue
considered
by
the
court.
does
the
fact
that
plaintiff
is
admittedly
statutorily
ineligible
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
section
244
(a)
(5)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
he,
the
plaintiff,
not
being
able
to
meet
the
physical
requirements
of
that
section,
preclude
the
plaintiff
from
presenting
for
consideration,
his
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
section
244
(a)
(1)
of
the
said
act.
he
had
been
admitted
that
the
plaintiff
didn't
fully
meet
the
requirements
of
latter
section.
mr.
david
w.
walters
your
honor,
he
had
a
hearing.
i
--
i
--
it's
my
position
and
position
of
the
petitioner
that
he
didn't
have
a
full
hearing
on
those
subjects
and
they
were
treated
summarily
because
of
the
fact
there
was
determination
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
that
under
no
circumstances
and
no
matter
how
much
was
heard
on
the
subject
would
he
be
eligible
because
he
had
not
met
the
statutory
requirements.
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
which
is
the
appellate
section,
the
matter
wasn't
even
considered.
it
wasn't
treated.
mr.
david
w.
walters
it
was
raised
but
the
entire
matter,
the
record
will
show
it
here
that
there
was
no
finding
whatsoever
on
whether
or
not
he
was
he
was
subject
to
any
hardship
like
deportation.
mr.
david
w.
walters
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
walters
i
was
counsel
not
in
the
original
hearing
but
in
the
court
proceedings,
i
was.
now,
i
think
that
what
it
requires
solely
is
an
ordinary
examination
of
english
and
the
word
“or”
still
means
to
me
“or”.
sometimes
words
are
too
complicated
with
some
other
meaning
but
it's
an
awfully
tiny
word
and
blackwell
dictionary
and
--
and
every
dictionary
that
you
will
consult,
give
the
conjunctive
meaning
that
is
afforded
it
and
that
is
that
it
is
in
the
alternate
of
something.
now,
a
person
unfamiliar
with
the
history
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
might
say,
“well
why
would
244
(a)
(1)
be
setup
so
differently
than
the
other
four?”
section
244
(a)
(1),
if
you
please,
has
relationship
only
to
those
people
who
entered
the
united
states
before
june1950.
it
has
relationship
only
to
those
people
who
were
in
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
seven
years
continuously.
in
effect,
it's
a
continuation
and
an
almost
every
essential
of
the
prior
suspension
of
deportation
features.
section
3
or
2
and
3
have
reference
only
to
those
people
who
entered
after
june
1950.
mr.
david
w.
walters
it's
in
the
language,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
walters
so
that
--
(1)
applies
to
the
attorney
general
within
five
years
after
the
effect
of
data
of
this
act
for
suspension
of
deportation
and
this
is
the
pertinent
part,
last
entered
the
united
states
more
than
two
years
prior
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act.
every
other
one
except
(5)
is
another
expression.
however
it
--
mr.
david
w.
walters
yes,
and
you
have
an
unusual
circumstance
all
these
other
sections,
2
and
3
include
entries
after
june
1950.
no
one
who
entered
prior
to
1950
can
make
applications.
four
has
the
same
application,
five,
has
the
same
application
with
the
addition
having
pertinence
to
statuses
that
were
of
deportation
which
were
acquired
subsequent
to
entry.
three,
two
and
--
two,
has
pertinence
only
to
those
people
who
were
subject
to
deportation
because
of
circumstances
or
statuses,
at
the
time
of
their
entry.
three,
subsequent
statuses
--
they
are
all
subsequent
to
entry.
four,
prior
to
the
entry.
the
only
one
that
stands
out
with
any
comparison
from
one
from
the
other
is
(1)
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
that.
the
reason
being
the
congress
wanted
it
that
way,
and
they
so
much
had
said
so
at
the
time
that
they
promulgated
to
statute.
congress
said
and
this
the
excerpt
from
the
report.
senate
report
137
81st
congress
session
report,
number
1515
and
wherein
they
made
the
following
recommendation.
the
sub
committee
recommends
that
the
present
suspension
of
deportation
provision
of
the
law
be
abolished
within
five
years
and
no
alien,
that
means
every
alien,
who
entered
the
united
states
within
a
period
of
two
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
proposed
legislation
shall
be
eligible
under
the
present
suspension
of
deportation
provisions
of
law
as
modified.
now,
if
the
court
will
examine
section
244
(a)
(1),
you
will
notice
that
as
we
speak
today
and
since
december
the
27th,
1957,
no
one
can
make
application
under
that
section.
in
other
words,
that
has
died
as
far
as
the
aliens
who
entered
prior
to1950
are
concerned
and
all
alliance
except
for
those
applications
that
are
pending
or
under
consideration.
so
we
see
that
the
congressional
intent
was
that
there
would
be
some
preservation
of
the
prior
suspension
of
deportation
provisions
until
a
certain
date.
mr.
david
w.
walters
it
is
--
mr.
david
w.
walters
it
is
almost
identical
except
that
prior
to
that,
there
had
to
be
the
concurrent
approval
of
congress.
whereas
in
the
others,
each
of
the
others,
two,
three,
four
and
five
contained
within
themselves
reference
to
their
own
subsections.
one
where
it
has
an
exclusion
of
eligibility
says
that
those
people
who
were
subject
to
deportation
under
section
3
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917,
section
19
(d),
were
ineligible
and
that's
the
only
reference
to
ineligibility.
mr.
david
w.
walters
--
is
relying
on
the
theory
of
--
the
various
subsections
as
the
basis
for
which
this
man
was
denied
the
right
to
have
his
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
considered.
in
other
words,
they
are
saying
that
the
excluding
provisions
in
each
of
the
subsection
will
travel
over
to
one
or
the
others
and
particularly
subsection
(1)
and
prevent
him
from
qualifying
under
subsection
(1).
that
argument
might
have
varied
except
that
self-contain
in
each
one
of
the
subsections,
there
is
a
reference
to
classes
of
aliens
who
are
excluded
from
consideration
under
that
particular
subsection.
in
subsection
(1)
it
says,
"is
deportable
under
any
law
of
the
united
states"
and
the
word
"any
law”
is
most
significant.
it
means
every
law
including
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
and
all
its
subsections,
and
is
not
a
member
of
a
class
of
whose
deportation
could
not
have
been
suspended
by
reason
of
section
19
(b)
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917
which
has
pertinence
to
criminal
and
moral
type
of
aliens.
section
2
says,
"it's
not
within
the
provisions
of
paragraph
(4)
of
this
subsection,"
this
subsection.
section
--
subsection
(3)
says,
"it's
not
within
the
provisions
of
paragraph
(4)
or
(5)."
subsection
(4)
says.
"it's
not
within
the
provisions
of
paragraph
(5)
of
the
subsection."
and
in
paragraph
(5)
enumerates
numerous
subsections
within
immigration
and
nationality
act
but
has
no
reference
whatsoever,
to
any
provisions
of
the
immigration
act
of
february
the
5th,
1917
as
does
section
1.
now,
as
i
can
be
permitted
with
some
liberties
of
the
respondent's
brief
as
far
as
this
question
of
mutual
excludability
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
read
from
page
13
of
the
brief
--
the
respondent's
brief
which
they
cite
the
reason
for
mutual
exclusive
theory.
one,
the
only
overlapping
between
(1)
and
(5)
under
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
is
as
to
pre-1950
entrance.
deportable
for
failure
to
report
or
for
worse,
security
offenses.
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
while
these
offenses
were
not
so
seriously
regarded
in
1940,
they
were
considered
very
important
in
1952.
the
over
--
overlapping
in
this
limited
respect
probably
represents
a
legislative
oversight.
and
not
--
in
other
words,
what
they
are
saying
is
that
there
does
exist
a
legislative
oversight
and
--
they
want
this
question
of
mutual
excludability
between
the
sections
that
this
oversight
could
be
supplied
by
this
court.
i
don't
think
it
was
an
oversight
at
all.
i
think
it
was
designed.
i
think
the
legislative
history
which
i
referred
to
in
my
brief
with
exact
quotes
from
the
authorities
shows
that
there
was
an
intention
that
this
subsection
(1)
stand
out
differently
form
all
the
others.
they
say
that
this
must
be
the
case,
although
they
don't
cite
any
reason
for
it
in
--
in
language
or
expressions
of
any
legislative
body.
this
must
be
the
case,
because
it
deals
section
5
--
it
deals
with
more
--
a
criteria
of
a
more
great
nature.
and
the
consequences
that
there
must
be
a
more
stringent
application
of
the
law.
well,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
to
section
5
as
contained
within
it,
as
a
qualification.
under
paragraph
(2)
of
section
240
(a)
--
241
(a)
is
a
person
who
has
remained
longer
in
the
united
states
than
the
period
for
which
he
was
admitted.
that's
precisely
the
ground
on
which
the
petitioner's
deportation
was
sought
originally.
it
cannot
be
more
stringent
in
this
paragraph
than
it
is
paragraph
(1)
or
more
grave
in
paragraph
(1)
than
it
is
in
paragraph
(5).
in
addition
to
that,
we're
faced
with
the
unusual
phenomenon
but
let's
suppose
for
example,
that
this
man
never
came
to
the
attention
to
the
immigration
service
that
he
entered
in
1947
prior
to
1950
as
he
did.
he
never
came
to
the
attention
of
the
immigration
service.
subsequent
to
december
1957,
he
does
come
to
the
attention
of
the
immigration
service.
he
is
not
charged
with
the
additional
charge
that
he
is
subject
to
deportation
because
he
failed
to
report
on
a
particular
genre.
there
is
no
place
within
this
section
or
any
of
the
subsections
wherein
this
man
could
qualify
for
suspension
of
deportation.
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
stringent
than
that.
so,
the
application
of
the
law
under
subsection
(1)
in
my
opinion,
the
people
of
this
class
is
more
stringent
than
number
(5).
mr.
david
w.
walters
all
right.
may
i
have
a
minute
to
--
i
just
like
to
address
myself
to
the
point
raised
by
justice
frankfurter.
in
the
event
this
court
were
to
remand
this
cause
and
eventually
refer
to
the
immigration
service
for
determination.
each
and
every
qualification
would
have
to
be
established
in
the
course
of
the
administrative
hearing
including
that
pertaining
to
hardship.
the
question
of
hardship
has
not
been
finally
administratively
decided.
it
has
been
disposed
of
summarily
in
the
course
of
every
proceeding.
mr.
david
w.
walters
well,
your
honor,
before
the
attorney
general
has
the
power
to
invoke
his
discretion,
there
must
be
established
the
fact
that
this
man
is
statutorily
eligible.
now,
certain
standards
are
established
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
course
of
the
proceeding,
that
would
create
a
criteria
for
determination
of
what
is
a
hardship
and
what
is
not,
even
as
far
as
statutory
requirements
are
concern.
mr.
david
w.
walters
just
--
just
one
further
point.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
question
of
stringency
and
severity.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
precise
ground,
in
other
word,
remaining
after
and
longer
than
the
period
for
which
he
was
admitted
is
contained
in
section
5
as
well
as
in
section
1.
and
so
this
question
of
section
5
dealing
with
grave
or
serious
offenses
against
the
deportation
act
isn't
true
at
all
and
--
mr.
david
w.
walters
probably
--
probably
the
very
reason
that
section
1
was
created.
in
other
words,
with
the
intention
in
--
i'm
speculating
although
i
like
to
avoid
speculation.
the
--
it's
created
with
the
intention
to
preserving
certain
rights
to
these
people
who
had
been
here
for
some
time
and
did
qualify
under
the
suspension
act.
i
quoted
in
my
brief
to
--
mr.
david
w.
walters
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
walters
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
walters
that
be
in
the
case
then
that
would
be
contained
in
within
section
1,
the
expressed
provision
as
it
has
with
other
grounds
that
people
who
were
subject
to
deportation
on
that
charge
were
not
eligible.
that
is
no
there.
he's
asking
you
to
supply
those.
