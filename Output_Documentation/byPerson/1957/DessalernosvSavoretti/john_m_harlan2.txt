the
stipulation
says
that,
if
i'm
reading
the
right
thing,
that

no
issue
of

to
be
tried
by
the

and
that
the
facts
is
found

right?
justice
john

now,
your
point
is,
as
i
understood
it,
that
the
examiner
having
found
that
unusual
hardship
did
not
exist
and
the
party
having
stipulated
that
the
facts
as
found
were
not
in
dispute,
that
we
in
effect
are
now
being
as
to
render
or
an
advisory
opinion
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
a
matter
that
we
don't
--
that
isn't
involved
because
under
either
section
because
of
that
undisputed
finding
is
deportable,
isn't
that
your
point?
