justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
jurisdiction
and
what
is
the
jurisdiction
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
appear
on
--
you
brought
a
jurisdiction.
does
that
appear
on
the
face
of
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
that
in
the
question
presented,
you
don't
even
put
this
as
the
question
presented.
in
your
brief,
it's
supposed
to
be
raised
for
the
first
time,
yet
they
don't
break
the
new
questions
presented.
what
--
i
don't
--
i'm
puzzled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
but
myself
wouldn't
care
if
it
wasn't
even
mentioned
or
you've
just
discovered
it.
what
is
the
jurisdictional
barrier
that
you
see
to
our
--
deciding
this?
do
we
really
have
that
power
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
would
that
case
in
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
qualification,
the
condition
under
which
the
suspensory
power
of
the
attorney
general
comes
into
play?
it's
demonstrated
or
conceded
not
to
exist,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
like
to
quote
this
a
little
more.
it's
one
thing
just
to
formulate,
define
the
question
on
which
the
government
like
to
have
an
opinion
although
the
fact
concededly
do
not
bring
--
bring
it
(inaudible)
the
court
should
say
no.
we
--
you
wait
until
you
got
a
case
that
really
raises
it.
it's
quite
another
thing
that
a
finding
is
made
by
a
subordinate
official,
not
contested
on
which
the
attorney
--
there's
a
final
--
the
attorney
general
has
to
deal
with
this
problem,
isn't
he,
ultimately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
have
to
go
through
before
it
can
get
into
court?
you
can't
go
to
the
court
on
the
finding
of
the
inquiry
officer,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
they
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
deal
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not
deal
with
this
point,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
important
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board
expressed
itself
on
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
the
last
have
(inaudible)
is
saying,
it
wouldn't
have
caused
us
to
make
any
change
in
the
decision.
that
doesn't
necessary
on
the
right,
the
ground
--
every
ground
of
the
decision,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
they
may
have
--
we
didn't
bother
about
this,
so
we
disagree
because
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
is
out,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
(inaudible)
--
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
roberts?
suppose
this
court
should
reverse
this
judgment,
would
that
automatically
involve
the
direction
that
the
attorney
general
automatically
have
to
gather
suspension
of
the
order
or
would
that
really
be
a
determination
of
the
claim
that
he
does
come
in
that
he's
not
limited
by
(1)
if
he
comes
in
under
(5),
and
with
anything
be
open
so
that
this
fact
that
there
is
--
if
this
was
a
--
an
arranged
case
to
get
a
ruling
(inaudible)
that
will
be
improperly
arraigned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
for
me
if
--
if
what
you're
raising
is
important
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
ought
to
lend
ourselves
through
giving
advisory
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
got
plenty
of
lawyers
to
do
that
for
you.
and
so
i
want
to
know
whether
that
would
mean
that
we
would
in
fact
be
adjudicating
what
might
be
a
fictitious
or
an
arranged
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
that's
the
question
i'm
asking.
if
--
depending
i
suppose
on
what
they
do.
i'm
assuming
without
any
basis
(inaudible)
that
will
even
reverse,
that
foreclose,
that
tie
the
hands
of
the
department
or
rather
that
would
be
a
direction
whereby
with
that
amount
would
be
tantamount
to
direct
to
the
attorney
general
to
suspend
this
order
of
deportation.
or
do
you
think
it
would
merely
mean
that
he
brings
himself
within
the
frame
of
section
1
and
that
the
attorney
general
would
still
have
to
decide
whether
the
basis
for
suspension
exist
i.e.
in
the
case
of
hardship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
might
shed
it
by
not
contesting
an
issue
in
a
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
brennan's
question
is
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
hasn't
shed
it
because
haven't
because
his
other
--
his
other
delegate,
the
u.s
attorney
had
agreed
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
that
fact
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
jurisdiction
can't
be
conferred
but
there
can't
be
an
agreement
that
something
is
a
fact
or
as
external
phenomenon
it
doesn't
exist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
yourself
indicated
a
minute
ago
that
there's
an
ambiguity
or
rather
there
is
a
contradiction
in
the
record,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
all
event
(inaudible)
it's
ambiguous,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
fact.
it's
also
clear
that
the
if
the
government
contends
the
basis
for
granting
suspension
doesn't
exist,
this
court
ought
not
to
make
the
--
the
attorney
general
to
suspend.
i
think
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
in
that
state
of
doubt,
assuming
there
should
be
a
reversal,
that
question
is
--
that
the
government
just
indicated,
should
be
left
open
at
the
least,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
stopping
you
but
i
think
it's
important
that
this
court
should
decide
a
case
or
not.
that
seems
to
be
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
so,
then
no
admission
have
legal
worth,
because
they're
merely
admitted
hypothetically
for
purposes
of
raising
the
legal
ground,
is
what
you
say
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
have
great
difficulty
in
being
able
conclude
that
if
this
stipulation
whether
you
call
it
agreement
and
admission
by
the
government.
if
it
doesn't
bind
the
attorney
general,
its
statute
of
limitations
probably
will
be
settled
against
the
government,
why
do
you
find
us?
i
don't
understand.
