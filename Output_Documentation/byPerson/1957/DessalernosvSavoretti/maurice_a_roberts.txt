mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
refer
the
statement
made
by
counsel
that
the
first
reference
made
to
the
jurisdictional
point
was
made
in
our
brief
on
the
merits.
i
believe
that
is
not
exactly
so.
we
did
raised
the
point
in
our
brief
in
our
position.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
facts
briefly
are
these.
the
petitioner
has
been
ordered
deported
after
entry
in
1947
on
two
grounds.
first,
as
a
seaman
who
failed
maintain
the
conditions
of
his
admission
as
a
non-immigrant.
and
second,
as
an
alien
who
willfully
failed
to
comply
with
the
alien
registration
provisions
of
the
1952
immigration
act.
the
latter
violation
is
covered
by
section
241
(a)
(5)
of
the
1952
act,
and
i
stress
that
(5)
because
that
is
the
section
which
is
referred
to
in
the
suspension
provision
which
i
shall
shortly
come
to.
in
1954,
he
applied
for
suspension
of
deportation
in
the
course
of
the
deportation
proceedings
and
was
given
a
hearing.
the
special
inquiry
officer
found
him
deportable
on
the
two
charges,
and
after
taking
the
testimony
which
he
had
a
full
opportunity
to
present
his
evidence
incidentally,
the
special
inquiry
officer
denied
his
application
for
suspension
finding
first
that
he
was
single
and
had
no
one
in
the
country
dependent
upon
him
for
support,
and
therefore
he
could
not
meet
the
hardship
prerequisite
to
suspension
which
lies
in
every
provision
of
the
suspension
statute.
the
special
inquiry
officer
also
found
that
since
the
petitioner
lacked
10
years
of
residence
in
this
country,
he
could
not
meet
the
requirements
of
subdivision
(5)
of
the
suspension
statute
which
is
section
244
of
the
1952
act.
the
fifth
subdivision
applies
to
persons
who
are
deportable
after
entry
on
specified
charges
and
one
of
those
charges
specified
is
the
group
deportable
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
registration
requirements.
having
denied
suspension
of
deportation,
special
inquiry
officer
ordered
deportation.
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
contending
that
since
he
arrived
in
1947,
and
in
1954
he
had
seven
years
of
residence,
he
came
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
first
subdivision
of
the
suspension
statute
which
applied
generally
to
aliens
who
arrived
in
the
united
states
prior
to
june
27,
1950
who
were
deportable
generally
under
any
law
of
the
united
states
and
who
are
not
within
the
inhibition
of
section
19
(d)
of
the
1917
immigration
act
which
i
shall
discuss
briefly.
and
the
petitioner
contends
that
his
seven
years
residence
qualifies
him
under
the
first
subdivision
and
that
his
case
should
not
be
governed
exclusively
by
the
fifth
subdivision
which
it
--
with
its
10-year
requirement
of
residence
which
he
concededly
cannot
meet.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
after
considering
the
evidence
as
stated
in
its
opinion,
show
no
reason
to
change
the
special
inquiry
officer's
decision
and
the
board
specifically
held
that
it
was
the
fifth
subdivision
which
governed
exclusively
in
the
petitioner's
case.
the
petitioner
thereupon
instituted
declaratory
judgment
proceedings
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
which
the
only
ground
he
raised
was
the
interpretation
by
the
immigration
authorities
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
with
respect
to
the
suspension
statute.
he
contended
there
that
his
eligibility
could
rest
on
the
first
subdivision
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
fifth.
and
in
the
district
court,
there
was
a
hearing
which
took
into
account
solely
the
administrative
record.
there
was
no
testimony
or
hearing
de
novo.
there
was
a
stipulation
--
an
oral
stipulation
among
the
parties
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
which
stated
that
the
facts
as
found
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
was
a
correct
statement
of
the
factual
situation,
and
there
was
also
a
stipulation,
a
narrow
one,
with
respect
to
the
issue
before
the
district
court.
and
in
stating
the
issue,
it
was
conceded
that
the
petitioner
was
ineligible
under
the
fifth
subdivision
because
he
lacked
the
physical
requirements
meeting
the
10-year
physical
presence
of
the
fifth
subdivision,
but
it
was
stated
he
fully
meets
the
requirements
of
the
first
subdivision.
and
it
was
on
this
issue
that
the
district
court
rendered
its
declaratory
judgment
finding
or
declaring
that
the
petitioner
was
ineligible
to
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
suspension
statute
section
244
(a)
of
the
1952
act.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
in
an
elaborate
opinion
which
goes
into
great
detail
and
which
is
printed
in
our
--
in
the
record.
the
issue
posed
here
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
apart
from
the
jurisdictional
question
which
we
raised
in
our
brief,
that
is
the
sole
question.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
this
was
the
first
time
it
was
brought
to
our
attention.
and
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
and
i
may
said
this,
we
would
be
most
happy
to
have
a
decision
on
the
issue
tendered
by
the
petition,
but
we
feel
that
it's
our
duty
to
bring
--
to
present
this
issue
to
the
court.
and
the
jurisdictional
issue
as
we
it
is
this,
that
there
is
no
justiciable
controversy
between
the
parties
because
on
this
record,
the
petitioner
being
unable
to
satisfy
the
hardship
prerequisite
of
the
suspension
statute,
cannot
possibly
be
eligible
for
suspension
of
deportation
regardless
of
whether
it
is
found
that
the
first
subdivision
applies
to
him
as
he
contends
or
the
fifth
as
we
contend.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
we
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
perhaps
that
is
because
we
suggested
that
might
have
been
--
that
we
could
have
presented
as
a
question
presented.
but
it
is
nonetheless
a
jurisdictional
question
which
we
felt
incumbent
upon
us
to
raise
and
whether
we
did
it
in
the
form
of
a
question
presented
or
otherwise,
we
feel
that
we
must
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
briefly
it
is
this.
it's
solely
whether
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
which
a
--
a
decree
of
a
federal
court
can
settle
with
definition
in
a
declaratory
judgment
suit,
whether
the
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
because
on
the
facts
of
record,
the
petitioner
cannot
qualify
for
suspension
of
deportation
so
that
a
decree
of
the
court,
grant
him
the
relief
that
he
request
which
is
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
has
--
ut
has
not
been
attacked
in
the
court.
it
was
found
not
to
exist
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
whose
decision
was
sustained
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
no
further
review
with
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
exactly.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
exactly.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
--
that
is
exactly
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
it.
in
other
words
that
--
the
question
i
suppose
is
in
effect
academic.
but
if
this
court
feels
that
it
has
jurisdiction,
we
will
be
very
happy
to
have
a
decision
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
beyond
--
there
is
no
further
administrative
action
to
be
taken
on
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
they
went
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
they
deal
--
they
affirmed
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
we
feel
that
they
did.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes.
well,
the
counsel
has
stated
that
this
point
was
raised
before
the
board
and
the
board
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
not
categorically.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
am
--
i
am
referring
to
page
8.
and
here
--
here
is
what
the
board
said.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
page
8
of
the
record.
the
board
said,
"after
carefully
considering
all
the
evidence
of
record
together
with
counsel's
representations
by
brief
on
appeal,
we
find
nothing
there
in
that
would
cause
us
to
make
any
change
on
the
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer."
and
immediately
before
that,
in
dealing
with
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
does
not
meet
the
physical
requirements
of
section
244
(a)
(5),
the
board
says,
"however,
he
is
ineligible
for
such
relief
since
among
other
things,
he
does
not
meet
the
physical
requirements."
now,
the
only
other
thing
there
was
in
a
special
inquiry
officer's
report
was
the
lack
of
the
hardship
issue.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
could
have,
yes.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i'm
thinking
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
this
was
merely
a
--
an
oral
stipulation
at
trial
which
was
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
simplifying
things.
now
read
on
context,
i
think
this
is
what
it
means,
your
honor.
the
reference
above
is,
he
the
plaintiff
not
being
able
to
meet
the
physical
requirements
of
that
section,
meaning
the
physical
presence
requirements.that's
what
the
statute
says.
and
then
below
when
they
refer
to
the
first
subdivision,
they
say,
"it's
being
admitted
that
the
plaintiff
fully
meets
the
requirements
of
the
latter
section."
i
think
they
were
referring
to
the
physical
presence
requirements
because
i
think
that
is
what
the
board
of
special
inquiry
--
rather
the
special
inquiry
officers'
decision
turned
on.
they
were
discussing
the
residence
requirements
in
10-year
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
that
was
just
an
error,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
i
have
no
other
means
of
accounting
for
it.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
understand.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
your
honor,
if
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
understand.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
only
reason
--
the
only
reason
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
if
this
court
held
that
the
petitioner
had
available
to
him,
the
first
subdivision
as
he
contends
and
the
matter
where
remanded,
he
would
get
nothing
because
it
has
already
been
administratively
determined
after
a
hearing
that
he
fails
to
meet
the
sine
qua
non
which
is
--
which
runs
through
every
division
of
this
suspension
statute,
this
unquestionable
hardship
provision.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
don't
see
how
the
attorney
general
could
shed
his
statutory
obligation,
because
it
was
the
congress
that
imposed
that
liability
upon
him.
congress
wrote
into
the
law,
this
requirement
of
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
having
already
determined
by
his
delegate,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
it
seems
to
me
that
he's
in
no
position
to
waive
it.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
but
his
stipulation
that
if
may
be
regarded
as
such
is
completely
incompatible
with
the
record
and
completely
incompatible
with
the
other
oral
stipulation
that
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
by
the
board
are
correct.
moreover,
if
there
is
a
lack
in
a
justiciable
issue,
it
cannot
be
supplied
by
a
stipulation
contra
the
fact.
jurisdiction
cannot
be
conferred
by
--
by
stipulation
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
except,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
fact
appears
right
on
the
record
here.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
underlying
facts
are
here
and
the
conclusory
facts
are
here.
it
is
not
denied.
i
--
i
can
point
it
out
right
on
the
record
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
that
mr.
walters
is
not
correct
in
his
statement.
he
didn't
received
a
full
hearing.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
all
of
the
--
may
i
say
this,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
complaint
--
the
complaint
does
not
--
does
not
raise
that
an
issue
--
as
an
issue.
this
is
the
first
time
that
--
that
comes
over
the
case.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
is
a
contradiction
solely
on
interpretation.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
so.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
i
should
like
to,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
on
the
question
of
statutory
construction,
the
sole
question
is
whether
the
overlap
which
seems
to
be
apparent
between
the
first
subdivision
and
the
fifth,
was
intended
by
congress
to
constitute
a
real
overlap
or
whether
congress
intended
the
one
or
the
other
to
govern.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
fifth
subdivision
was
intended
by
congress
to
govern
because
in
the
fifth
subdivision,
congress
specifically
made
reference
to
aliens
who
are
deportable
under
specified
sections
of
the
act
and
that
congress
therein
enumerated
the
aliens
who
are
deportable
on
the
most
serious
charges.
the
fifth
subdivision
requires
the
alien
to
establish
ten
years
of
good
moral
character
from
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
deportable
offense.
it
also
requires
that
before
the
suspension
administratively
granted
by
the
attorney
general
can
become
final,
the
congress
must
take
affirmative
action
by
a
concurrent
resolution.
and
the
fifth
subdivision
applies
to
aliens
who
are
within
the
specified
categories
regardless
of
the
day
of
entry.
now,
in
contradistinction,
the
first
subdivision
under
which
the
petitioner
claims
applies
generally
to
aliens
who
entered
the
united
states
prior
to
june
27th,
1950
who
are
deportable
under
any
law
of
the
united
states
generally
except
certain
specified
laws
enumerated
in
section
19
(d)
of
the
immigration
act
of
1917
which
precluded
suspension
on
the
part
of
the
most
serious
offenders.
the
narcotic
violators,
the
immoral
classes,
subversives
et
cetera.
the
first
subdivision
requires
a
showing
of
seven
years
of
residence
and
good
moral
character
immediately
preceding
the
application,
so
that
there
was
immediately
apparent,
a
difference,
a
qualitative
difference
in
the
approach
of
the
congress
to
the
two
classes,
and
it
seems
clear
that
congress
intended
the
fifth
subdivision
with
its
more
stringent
requirements
to
govern
the
more
serious
offenses.
in
the
10-year
residence
period
and
good
moral
character
period
following
upon
the
commission
of
the
deportable
offense,
congress
evidently
set
up
a
reformed
period,
a
probationary
period,
and
it
must
be
born
in
mind
that
most
of
the
enumerated
groups
of
deportable
aliens
set
forth
in
the
fifth
subdivision
were
the
ones
who
were
absolutely
precluded
from
suspension
altogether
under
the
1917
act
because
of
the
serious
nature
of
their
deportable
offenses.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
not
all
of
them.
as
i
see
it,
there
are
11
categories
and
of
these
11
categories,
nine
are
the
same
as
those
encompassed
within
section
19
(d)
of
the
1917
act.
there
are
two
new
categories
that
have
been
added.
one
happens
to
be
the
petitioner's
category
and
then
there's
another
one,
a
group
of
persons
guilty
of
war
time
offenses.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
this
petitioner?
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
is
an
anomaly
because
under
the
1917
act,
this
petitioner
wasn't
even
deportable
in
the
first
place.
on
this
alien
registration
violation,
this
alien
registration
violation
was
not
made
the
deportable
offense
until
the
1952
act.
and
the
history
of
the
alien
registration
offenses
indicates
that
by
1952,
congress
had
taken
a
very
deem
view
of
them,
and
had
therefore
included
them
within
the
most
serious
offenses
and
therefore
covered
them
into
the
fifth
subdivision.
now,
there
are
certain
anomalies
which
follow
if
an
alien
who
is
deportable
on
this
serious
charges
is
found
also
to
be
suspendable
under
the
more
lenient
provisions
of
the
first
subdivision.
and
in
the
brief
time
available,
i
should
like
to
point
out
a
few.
for
example,
the
statute
also
permits
voluntary
departure
which
a
lesser
form
of
relief
and
suspension
of
deportation.
in
the
case
of
aliens
who
were
deportable
on
these
serious
types
of
charges,
the
statute
requires
ten
years
of
residence
before
the
alien
can
qualify
for
this
lesser
form
of
relief,
so
that
it
would
be
odd
if
congress
should
preclude
a
person
in
the
petitioners'
class
from
the
lesser
form
of
relief
of
voluntary
departure,
and
at
the
same
time
permit
him
to
have
the
major
form
of
suspension
of
deportation
under
the
first
category.
then
there
is
also
this.
the
reform
provision
in
the
fifth
category
requires
10
years
of
residence
and
good
moral
character
since
commission
of
the
deportable
offense.
the
first
subdivision
requires
seven
years
of
character
--
of
good
moral
character
and
residence,
immediately
preceding
the
filling
of
the
application.
the
petitioner
arrived
here
in
1947
as
a
seaman.
he
could
first
establish
the
seven
years
of
good
moral
character
by
1954,
but
that
was
the
very
year
in
which
he
committed
this
alien
registration
violation
which
led
to
his
being
ordered
deported
under
the
fifth
subdivision,
and
it
was
indeed
anomalous
for
congress
to
want
him
to
be
suspendable
under
the
first
subdivision
when
they
extracted
a
10-year
probationary
period
from
all
the
persons
listed
in
this
fifth
category.
in
our
brief,
we
also
developed
at
some
length
the
fact
that
this
various
categories
were
designed
to
be
neutrally
exclusive,
and
there
was
some
legislative
history
to
support
that.unfortunately,
most
of
the
conclusions
with
respect
to
this
legislation
must
be
based
on
inferences
drawn
from
facts
because
these
suspension
provisions
were
not
the
most
controversial
of
the
mccarran-walter
act
when
it
was
in
debate.
but
in
closing,
i
should
like
to
point
this
out.
the
fifth
subdivision
is
the
only
one
which
applies
without
time
limitation
whatsoever,
it
applies
retrospectively
as
well
as
prospectively,
it
applies
to
all
aliens
of
the
specific
classes
enumerated.
and
we
believe
that
this
is
one
instance
where
it
can
clearly
be
said
that
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
should
govern
which
states
generally
that
a
specific
provision
governs
a
general
one.
this
court
has
stated
it
very
aptly
in
the
ginsberg
case.
the
general
language
of
a
statutory
provision
although
broad
enough
to
include
it,
will
not
be
held
to
apply
to
a
matter
specifically
dealt
with
in
another
part
of
the
same
enactment.
and
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
he
could
not
have
been
ordered
deported
before
1952
and
he
wasn't
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
there
were
--
there
were
other
types
of
persons
included
within
this
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
are
others
--
there
are
other
sections
of
the
statute
which
deal
with
this
specific
type
of
offense
and
preclude
some
relief
to
this
whole
group
of
11
types
of
offenders.
this
is
merely
one
of
the
instances
in
which
these
serious
group
of
offenders
are
handled
in
a
special
form.
more
is
required
of
them
than
of
other
types
of
deportable
offenders.
and
since
this
group
has
been
so
singled
out,
we
believe
that
this
overlap
which
is
present
if
we
read
the
statute
literally,
we
believe
that
this
overlap
was
not
designed
or
intended
by
congress
to
permit
an
alien
who
happens
to
fall
within
the
overlap
to
take
advantage
of
the
more
lenient
provisions
of
the
first
subdivision.
when
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
was
most
interested
that
those
who
fell
within
the
fifth
subdivision
which
encompass
the
most
serious
offenders
should
show
a
longer
period
of
genuine
reform
and
that
congress
should
be
required
to
have
a
concurrent
resolution
before
their
suspension
would
be
effective
which
is
not
the
case
with
the
first
subdivision.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
no
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
that
point
was
raised
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
these
are
conclusions
and
they
admit
the
facts
which
are
contra
the
record.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
but
that
--
that
is
--
as
i
see
it,
a
conclusion
based
on
facts.
