your
position
mr.

you're
not
given
an
opportunity

it
would
be
a
hardship
case.

is
that
then
the
only
question
is
before
us,
the
one
that
the
court
--
district
court
and
its
judgment
stated
with
the
issue?
it's
the
only
one
thing
he
said
that's
been
orally
stipulated
before
the

that
the
sole
question
to
be
decided
by
the
court
was
to
wit
it.
does
the
fact
that

is
admittedly
statutory
ineligible
for
suspension
and
deportation
under
section

(a)
(5)
of
the

it's
being
admitted
that
the
plaintiff
fully

section,
and
it
says
in

court
having
heard
the
argument,
a
defiance.

the
sole
question
that
we
have
before
us
here?

you
mean
the
one
that

you
raised
for
the
first
time
here?

now,
is
there
a
reason
why
you
raised
that
for
the

time
here?

warren
where
are
you
referring?
