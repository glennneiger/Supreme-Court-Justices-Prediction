justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
you
have
reached
a
constitutional
question
if
you
conclude
that,
namely
if
he
is
whatever
maybe
a
purely
executive
officer
then
the
president
has
constitutional
power
inherently
to
dismiss
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
is
a
constitutional
conclusion
even
though
there
may
no
--
be
no
constitutional
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
i
think
in
here,
well,
you
seem
without
cause.
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
cause.
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
why
your
qualification
without
cause
if
you
--
do
you
thereby
imply
that
if
the
president
had
a
good
cause,
a
relevant
cause,
you
could
have
been
with
mr.
jones
or
mr.
--
mr.
myron
wiener?
you've
been
derelict
in
the
conduct
of
this
office
and
i
will
appoint
john
jones
to
give
you
a
chance
to
be
heard.
he
will
report
back
to
me
and
if
i
find
that
you
have
been,
i'll
fire
you?
do
you
think
that
--
that
would
be
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
let
me
--
it
hasn't
been
clearer.
he
could
--
this
is
a
term
fixed
or
a
term
contingent
upon
an
event
which
is
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
if
nothing
is
said
about
the
basis
for
removal
or
curtailing
opinion,
you
still
have
to
decide
whether
it
comes
within
the
inherent
power
of
president,
see
what
the
law
of
the
state
to
be
executed.
that
he
may
move
to
terminate
and
to
--
are
you
saying
anymore
that
there
may
be
of
this
whether
he
is
--
is
a
so
called
executive
officer
and
imply
qualification
that
he
may,
the
president,
may
and
must
go
through
a
notice
and
hearing
at
the
ground
shown.
is
that
all
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
it
--
it
doesn't
come
--
merely
comes
within
--
broadly
speaking,
humphrey's
rather
than
myers,
then
it
--
the
cause
is
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
it
hasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
hasn't.
congress
says
that
if
he
finds
him
derelict
in
his
duty
or
he's
too
old
or
whatnot,
he
may
then
shortlist
that.
that
is
in
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i'd
--
i
--
i'd
like
not
to
be
mixed
up
about
the
cause
fact
in
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
president
may
and
--
and
often
does
and
one
hopes
frequently
takes
action
that
an
--
action
that
are
none
reviewable
in
the
courts
and
yet
--
yet
must
have
some
rational
justification.
and
the
more
he
announces
the
rational
justification,
the
better,
but
that
doesn't
concern
the
reviewability
of
what
he
does
if
he
has
inherent
power
to
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
the
--
the
kind
of
--
the
concerns
of
this
commission
were
a
fund
that
was
in
existent,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
were
the
functionary
who
were
the
trustee
we're
broadly
speaking
at
this
time?
where
was
its
fund
--
to
this
position
of
this
fund
lie?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
amount
of
money
could
be
distributed
among
those
who
had
defined
--
who
had
provable
claims
against
it
to
make
sure
the
approval
of
--
granting
defined
by
congress,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fund
was
in
the
treasury
and
the
disposing
office
of
the
--
pass
on
the
claims
up
to
the
time
this
commission
was
passed.
did
anybody
pass
on
those
claims?
isn't
properly
construed
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
executive
of
treasury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
just
as
it
were
in
escrow,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
want
to
know
the
situation
before
the
war
claims
commission
was
in
existence.
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
given
authority
to
hear
claims
against
this
fund,
is
that
right?
now
before
they
were
in
existence,
there
was
a
fund,
was
there
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
to
the
time,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
the
war
claims
commission
wasn't
in
existence.
there
was
no
such
act
who
could
draw
against
that
fund,
who
could
determine,
who
had
a
valid
claim
against
that,
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
hadn't
made
provisions
for
asserting
claims
against
that
fund,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
forget
about
the
claims
commission?
i'm
coming
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
what
there
was
in
existent
before
there
was
the
war
claims
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
--
what
the
government's
situation
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
know
--
could
anybody
get
any
money
out
of
that
fund
before
the
war
claims
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
the
answer
is
no.
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
had
made
--
made
no
such
provision.
could
--
congress
had
provided
there's
all
claims
against
that
fund
should
be
determine
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
the
attorney
general?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
answer,
it
could
because
in
other
such
claims
it
has
done
so.
as
congress
had
done
variously
about
claim
against
funds
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
it
catered
from
a
foreign
country,
as
you
indicated.
it
did
it
as
to
mexican
and
all
other
international
conflicts
and
it
has
done
so
as
to
special
claims
against
foreign
governments
asserted
by
this
government
on
behalf
of
some
individuals,
like
the
famous
case,
the
la
abra
company.
and
did
they
--
that's
one
of
three
things,
it
self
decided
that
john
smith
is
entitled
to
it,
promised
to
do
that,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
decide
that
the
secretary
of
state
should
determine
that,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
does
--
done
so
in
the
past.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
the
decision
in
la
abra
which
instead
indicated
that
--
that
congress
did
one
of
three
things.
it
could
make
a
disposition.
it
could
--
it
leaves
the
disposition
for
determination
by
some
executive
officials
or
it
could
make
it
a
matter
of
going
to
court,
usually
with
the
court
of
claims,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
could've
been
done
as
to
this
fund,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
affect
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
what
is
legislative,
what
is
executive
is
determinable
by
so-called
a
natural
law,
that
those
are
pitched
--
that
it
were
(inaudible)
that
there
they
are
and
no
amount
of
(inaudible)
could
change
their
meaning
or
their
--
their
use
or
their
function,
is
that
what
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
there
must
be
some
deeper
problem
here
than
putting
a
label
and
saying
this
is
legislative
because
i
find,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
the
cases
that
i
fought,
that
isn't
a
hypothetical
case.
those
are
cases
in
the
book,
the
la
abra
company
and
mexican
company.
congress
from
time
to
time
does
it
and
one
of
three
ways,
it
itself
as
this
fellow
has
a
lawful
claim
and
the
mexican
government
is
paid
over
to
the
united
states,
so
many
thousands,
a
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
john
jones
can
get
it.
or
it
leaves
it
to
the
secretary
of
state
to
determine
whether
his
claim
is
bona
fide
or
not.
or
it
says,
you
go
to
the
court
of
claims
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
congress
--
there
are
no
law
in
federal
courts
until
congress
passes
an
act
establishing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
to
the
district
and
circuit
judges,
execute
--
are
they
legislative?
are
their
legislative
people?
do
you
decide
that
they
can't
be
ruled
by
the
president
because
they
are
legislative?
would
that
make
intelligent
talk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
let's
take
before
the
--
when
the
court
--
take
the
territory
of
judges
which
never
had
like
opinions,
(inaudible)
what
do
you
say
about
the?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
the
president
have
dismissed
them?
congress
said
that
you
--
that
they
shall
have
a
tenure
of
eight
years
or
10
years
whatever
it
was.
could
the
congress
say
this
is
a
bad
judge
and
i'm
going
to
fire
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
we
only
dealt
with
problems
in
which
this
court
have
decided,
we
wouldn't
have
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
interesting
time
with
having
--
to
argue
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'd
supposed
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
the
territory
judges
were
not
article
3
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
because
of
that
fact,
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
that
you
have
brought
dismissed
the
territorial
judge
who
has
only
a
tenure
of
eight
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
judicial
officers,
i
should
think,
judges
of
a
territory
must
be
judicial
officers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
that
doesn't
help
one
to
decide
whether
when
it
doesn't.
he
had
it
by
virtue
of
his
office.
and
i
should
think
it'd
be
easy
to
answer,
the
federal
trade
commission
can't
be
fired
before
--
by
the
president
except
under
the
conditions
of
congress
has
laid
down,
territorial
judges
couldn't
be.
i
should
think
that
be
not
too
great
a
jump
in
reasoning,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
if
you
had
doubt
about
that
and
you
ought
to
have
any
doubt
--
then
you
ought
to
have
the
greatest
doubt
about
this
case.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
doubt
about
the
territorial
in
court
of
claims
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
you
have
a
hard
time
in
extracting
your
judgment
from
the
issue
in
order
to
advance
the
argument.
the
point
of
my
argument
is
that
we
didn't
talk
in
the
(inaudible)
by
juggling
words,
executive
and
legislative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you?
i
ought
to
know
this
mr.
solicitor
but
i
don't.
would
you
mind
stating
what
the
course
of
ultimate
determination
is
after
this
commission
passed
on
a
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
apart
from
the
cases
that
we've
had
here
recently
what's
open
for
a
court
consideration?
were
these
determinations
awards
or
denial
of
law
to
the
amount
of
the
award
subject
to
change
at
the
will
of
the
executive,
the
treasury
or
the
president?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
ask
you
about
other
agencies
that
are
different
but
if
you
can
tell
me,
was
this
commission
in
its
authority
the
finality
of
it
like
or
unlike
the
indian
commission
that
has
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
executive
changes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
you
will
recall
that
the
act
passed
by
the
first
congress,
contention
of
its
revolutionary
veterans
which
held
not
enforceable
but
it
is
just
as
this
court
sitting
on
(inaudible)
for
the
reasons
that
their
determination
was
nearly
to
be
recommendatory
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
same
thing
disposed
of
what
were
made
for
the
first
court
of
claims
act.
i
remembered
section
14
said
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
could
revive
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
short,
if
we're
trying
to
make
in
the
first
measure,
the
court,
the
circuit
court
in
the
first
court
of
claims
act,
the
court,
an
agency,
a
functionary
of
an
honest
regard,
presidential
annexed
to
it,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
there
is
no
such
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
like
--
there
are
no
such
use
here
of
this
commission
as
a
fact
finding
body
for
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
then
to
make
the
determination,
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question
then
i'll
try
to
stop
for
a
while.
i
speak
as
one
whom
was
--
it
comes
relevant,
not
sympathetic
to
the
result
in
the
myers
case.
i
want
to
know,
disclose
my
attitude,
i
want
to
know
if
--
if
i
gathering
--
i
haven't
read
your
brief
but
i
had
paged
it.
why
this
case
seems
to
you
so
important
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
of
this
government?
because
i
think
those
considerations
are
from
my
point
of
view
is
relevant
to
this
kind
of
a
problem?
you
--
you
almost
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
you
reargued
the
myers
case,
but
you
go
in
heavily
on
the
whole
problem
of
the
presidential
removal
power.
and
perhaps
before
you
get
through
it,
you
will
say
something
about
why
you
deem
this
case
is
so
important.
i
don't
mean
to
say
it's
unimportant
but
why
do
you
think
it
has
a
reach
such
as
your
brief
implies,
i,
for
one
would
be
much
interested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
didn't
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
--
perhaps
to
get
further
like
to
the
--
when
i
said
i
wasn't
sympathetic
with
the
myers
case,
my
lack
of
sympathy
derived
from
declaring
unconstitutional
the
limitation
such
as
congress
have
placed
upon
it
which
this
court
nullified.
then
along
come
humphrey,
and
it
goes
on
to
my
reading
of
it
the
consideration
of
the
intrinsic
things
that
these
functionaries
do
and
he
seems
to
make
a
distinction
between
executive
in
the
sense,
a
part
of
the
president's
business.
the
fellows
who
--
in
this
vast
establishment
of
ours,
who
are
his
various
agencies,
his
functionaries,
means
of
carrying
out
his
job
for
the
improvement?
and
therefore,
i
should
think
humphrey's
(inaudible)
you
got
to
look
to
the
intrinsic
kind
of
the
thing
that
a
body
does.
and
if
it
is
--
doesn't
--
is
charged
with
determining
issues
not
unlike
extensions,
what
courts
do
that
if
--
a
federal
case
--
to
the
humphrey,
they
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
if
you've
got
a
commission,
a
bargain,
making
these
positions,
the
vastness
of
the
firm
doesn't
make
him
different.
the
fact
that
congress
could
as
you
say
and
has
done
in
the
past
that
the
secretary
of
state
do
all
this
because
it
does
involve
foreign
relations.
when
congress
hasn't
done
that,
has
appointed
a
commission,
did
on
fact,
the
way
the
court
of
claims
has
--
do
all
the
time
and
make
awards
and
doesn't
give
corrective
means,
doesn't
make
the
determination
subject
to
the
final
determination
of
some
functionary
or
some
completed
function
as
the
president,
the
secretary
of
state
whom
he
could
fire
at
will.
that's
not
a
nice
word
to
use
by
the
way,
(inaudible)
displace
at
will.
but
(inaudible)
what
they
say
in
passing
on
whether
john
smith
has
a
good
claim
final,
then
--
then
i
am
much
interested
to
have
it
differentiated
from
what
is
the
heart,
to
me
at
least,
and
what
was
also
a
surprise,
i
was
surprised
by
both
of
the
decisions,
if
i
may
say
so.
yes,
the
heart
of
the
humphrey's
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
award
is
made,
must
be
a
judgment
or
whatever
it's
called
--
what
is
it
called,
an
award?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
award
is
made,
must
the
money
be
paid
out
in
--
in
--
must
that
award
be
honored
by
the
treasury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
way
a
court
of
claims
--
in
the
way
--
a
court
of
claims
award
really
requires
an
appropriation
by
the
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
you
suppose
that
they
could
have
done
it
with
reference
to
this,
but
they
did
with
reference
to
the
mexican
claims,
the
la
abra
case,
and
have
chosen
to
put
this
into
the
district
court,
could
have
said
anybody
who
has
a
claim
against
us
must
prove
it
before
a
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
enemy
powers
are
out,
aren't
they?
they're
out,
and
out
of
this
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
this
fund
isn't
--
is
going
to
go
either
to
claimants
or
remain
in
the
treasury
of
united
states,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
anyhow,
the
enemy
powers
around,
congress
may
compassionately
turn
some
over,
of
course
it
be
compassionate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
many
--
but
many
questions
about
whether
the
claimant
is
--
is
a
bona
fide
claimant,
whether
the
--
he's
really
a
stalking
horse
for
the
german
or
japanese
interest
etcetera,
etcetera,
isn't
that
true?
that
all
these
issues
come
into
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
mean,
in
--
in
regard
to
the
fund,
that
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
vesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
all
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
doesn't
this
commission
have
to
pass
on
those
issues?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
to
prove
this
claim,
the
claimants
before
this
commission
have
to
prove
the
amount
and
the
actual
laws?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
to
make
good
on
those
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
lateral
estoppel
is
that
the
examination
in
the
quo
warranto
proceedings
in
the
court
--
the
first
instance,
the
president's
powers
were
not
restricted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
case
is
on
the
way
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
new
commission
and
congress
exercise
its
power
to
put
an
end
to
this
gentleman's
office,
put
it
on
the
way
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
appeals
in
large?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
only
if
congress
passed
a
legislative
amount
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
but
the
appeal
from
the
(inaudible)
--
from
the
district
court
was
on
the
way
up,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
--
it
wouldn't
be
shocking
to
interpret
the
stipulation
as
not
inclined
that
wiener
stipulated
himself
out
of
his
litigation
for
all
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
have
to
do
that,
wouldn't
you?
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
stipulation
would
have
to
be
at
least
a
negligence
or
(inaudible)
failure
to
have
it
vacated
so
you
must
(inaudible)
to
do
what
he
did
here.
that's
what's
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
enough
to
the
government
anyhow
to
vacate
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
stipulation
is
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
reply
brief
on
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
footnote
on
page
7.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
rule
21.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
--
there's
evidently
something
bearing
on
justice
brennan's
question,
agreement
of
dismissal
that
is
hereby
agreed,
etcetera,
and
the
clerk
is
hereby
directed
to
render
the
case
dismissed
and
that
he
transmit
a
certified
copy
of
this
agreement
to
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
slightest
notion
what
--
what
that
implies,
that
evidently
something
is
implied,
the
district
court
does
something
in
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wachtel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
really,
we
ought
to
decide
that
in
this
case,
we
had
a
lot
of
trouble,
you
probably
remember
the
case
better
than
i
am,
with
the
navy
fellow
who
died
and
then
somebody
else
or
somebody
took
his
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
of
us
--
some
of
us
thought
not
with
the
exception
of
the
court,
that
really
that
was
a
--
an
accident
in
the
united
states,
that
it's
a
(inaudible)
now
the
ball
as
you
could
force
into
the
(inaudible)
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
there
are
major
issues
which
are
even
more
important
maybe
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
rule
21?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
it
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
was
--
all
i
know
is
what
i
read
in
your
footnote.
this
was
an
agreement
and
then
there
was
--
at
the
end
there,
it
should
go
back
to
the
--
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
should
be
notified.
what
is
he
to
be
notified
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
--
what
does
he
--
what's
his
interest
in
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
what's
his
interest
unless,
i
doesn't
mean
to
--
i
meant
to
suggest,
unless
if
some
notification
that
something
is
happening
to
a
litigation
which
up
to
that
time
was
on
the
books
of
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
all
that
you
did
in
this
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
never
going
to
do
it
this
way
again,
i'm
sure.
