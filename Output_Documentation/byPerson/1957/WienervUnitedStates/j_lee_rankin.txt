mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
addition
that
the
government
would
like
to
make
to
the
statement
of
the
case
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
that
the
court
of
claims
made
it
very
clear
in
its
judgment
that
it
was
not
satisfied
to
all
that
there
would
be
no
power
to
remove
this
petitioner
that
it
found
that
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
interfere
with
the
presidential
power
and
that
it
could
not
delete
that
it
was
congress'
purpose
or
intent
in
connection
with
this
legislation
that
the
only
resort
should
be
to
the
cumbersome
and
very
difficult
and
unusual
procedure
of
impeachment.
and
therefore,
although
the
court
of
claims
concluded
that
the
function
of
this
commission
was
both
legislative
and
judicial
with
which
conclusion
the
government
disagrees.
it
held
that
the
petitioner
could
be
removed
by
the
president
because
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
leave
this
--
this
man
without
any
control
in
connection
with
this
work.
on
the
question
of
what
power
is
in
the
president
seems
to
us
resolves
around
the
question
of
the
character
of
the
functions
of
the
office.
the
myers
case
holds
up
an
executive
office
in
general
terms
that
the
president
has
a
power
that
cannot
be
interfered
with
to
remove.
and
the
humphrey
case
holds
that
if
the
functions
are
legislative
and
judicial
and
if
the
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
it
intends
that
there'd
be
no
interference
by
the
executive
by
the
president
in
the
removal
that
--
the
removal
cannot
be
made
except
in
accordance
with
the
terms
defined
by
the
congress
in
the
legislation.
and
you
recall
in
that
legislation
they
found
that
there
wasn't
desired
by
the
congress
to
have
this
commission
be
independent,
that
it
was
made
bipartisan,
that
it
was
to
exercise
chancery
functions
like
a
court
and
carry
out
some
of
the
legislative
process
in
making
rules
and
regulations
and
because
of
all
of
these
various
things
that
the
congress
had
clearly
indicated
its
intention
and
purpose
and
also
by
providing
express
provisions
on
the
ground
of
negligence
and
failure
to
malfeasance,
properly
carry
out
the
acts
of
the
office
and
the
three
grounds
prescribed
that
the
congress
had
shown
that
it
should
not
--
the
president
should
not
have
the
power
of
removal
except
as
defined
expressly
in
the
act
itself.
in
the
ruberoid
case,
this
court
in
a
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson
which
was
not
disagreed
with
in
this
particular
by
the
rest
of
the
court
wing
into
at
some
length
as
to
what
is
the
nature
of
administrative
body
that
is
carrying
on
a
legislative
function.
and
in
that
opinion,
he
develops
a
considerable
length,
the
fact
that
in
such
--
in
carrying
on
such
a
function,
congress
generally
lays
down
a
statute
which
is
more
or
less
in
skeleton
form
and
it
--
you
might
say
it's
the
high
spots
that
describes
the
general
provisions
and
then
it
oppose
upon
the
administrative
body
the
duty
to
try
to
define
and
go
into
detail
as
to
the
application
by
rules
and
regulations
that
are
developed
under
that.
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
function
that
the
federal
trade
commission
in
a
case
that's
just
been
illustrated
before
the
court
before
this
one.
now,
in
regard
to
the
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
functions
of
such
an
administrative
body,
we
think
that
in
this
kind
of
a
problem,
we
are
getting
into
the
question
of
the
separation
of
powers
and
is
where
the
administrative
body
is
exercising
the
function
under
article
3,
that
is
the
judicial
function
of
the
courts
that
this
court
has
said
that
there
could
not
be
a
removal
because
in
that
area
the
administrative
body
is
carrying
on
a
decision
and
judgment,
a
feature
that
is
the
very
nature
of
the
principles
of
separation
of
powers
should
not
be
under
the
control
and
dictate
of
the
president.
now,
if
we
examine
the
statute
to
see
what
kind
of
authority
this
commission
had,
we
find
that
the
statute
gave
the
petitioner
full
guidance
that
he
did
not
have
to
implement
the
statutory
standards.
he
did
not
have
to
have
a
skeleton
statute
but
he
had
clearly
defined
provisions
in
the
statute
which
told
him
just
how
he
was
to
decide
about
these
claims.
and
by
the
way,
this
was
a
fund
that
was
developed
out
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
which
was
amended
from
time
to
time
but
was
passed
during
the
first
world
war
in
regard
to
enemy
assets
and
large
number
of
assets
of
both
the
japanese
and
germans
had
been
taken
over
and
it
was
estimated
by
the
courts
to
congress
that
they
--
this
fund
amounted
to
some
$300
million
that
was
going
to
be
disposed
of
depending
upon
the
amount
of
the
claims
by
these
commissioners.
so,
it
was
a
task
that
had
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
and
the
country
had
very
genuine
and
great
interest
in
its
proper
administration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
was
no
--
there
was
an
express
provision
that
there
could
be
no
appeals.
there
was
a
provision
for
processing
the
claim
and
then
an
appeal
to
the
commission
itself.
but
the
statute
provided
it
expressly
that
there
would
be
no
appeal
and
no
action
by
mandamus.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
were
not.
the
commission's
determination
was
final,
whatever
it
decide
the
statute
prohibited
any
appeal
or
any
revision
or
of
such
connection
with
any
kind.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
my
recollection
about
the
indian
claims
commission
is
that
there
is
a
provision
for
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
claims
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
was
a
provision
for
internees
who
were
detained
during
the
war
to
receive
specific
benefits
and
they
would
receive
$60
per
each
calendar
month
of
interned
and
compensation
on
the
basis
of
weekly
wage
and
also
compensation
on
the
basis
of
weekly
wage
of
$37
and
a
half.
then
there
was
a
further
provision
for
prisoners
of
the
war,
a
set
of
categories
in
the
sections
5
to
8
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
detail
language
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
on
page
76,
section
5
and
then
it
goes
on
to
section
6
on
page
80,
7
on
page
83,
and
8
is
the
provision
for
the
report
on
page
84.
then
a
summary
of
those
provisions
were
set
out
in
our
brief
on
pages
47,
48,
and
a
part
of
49.
section
6
provides
for
prisoners
of
war
or
their
survivors
to
receive
a
dollar
a
day
for
each
day
the
enemy
government
failed
and
this
is
the
language,
“to
furnish
him
the
quantity
or
quality
of
food
to
which
he
was
entitled
as
a
prisoner
of
war
under
the
terms
of
the
geneva
convention
of
july
27th,
1929
which
was
regarded
to
the
treatment
of
prisoners
of
war.”
so
you
see
the
amount
that
could
be
awarded
under
both
of
those
sections
and
the
criteria
for
determining
in
that
amount
were
expressed
so
all
that
the
commission
had
to
do
would
determine
whether
or
not
the
particular
claim
came
within
the
definition
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
right.
but
they
would
--
they
would
not
have
to
extend
the
language
of
the
statute
by
rules
or
regulations
or
legislative
--
quasi-legislative
action
like
the
federal
trade
commission
or
some
of
the
other
commissions
do.
they
would
merely
take
a
criteria
like
has
been
done
with
a
mixed
claims
commission
or
with
other
commissions
during
our
history
and
determine
in
accordance
with
the
statute
whether
the
claim
came
within
the
best
provisions
and
they're
either
in
or
out
depending
upon
the
factual
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
fixed
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
different.
and
i'll
try
to
elaborate
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
the
executive
branch,
administrators
in
many
areas
this
court
has
recognized
determines
facts
and
applies
the
law
to
facts
and
still
is
exercising
an
executive
function.
it
isn't
a
--
this
court
held
has
not
just
by
determining
facts
and
applying
the
law
of
those
facts.
it
is
not
exercising
a
judicial
function.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
there's
a
claim
filed
and
it
is
--
it
possibly
could
come
into
that
kind
of
a
category
as
a
judicial
proceeding
in
accordance
to
what
article
3
requirements.
if
there
was
a
controversy
or
case
and
if
there
was
adversary
and
there
was
this
subpoena
served
and
the
pleadings
developed
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
can't
under
this
act.
but
if
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
cannot.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
it's
expressly
provided
that
if
the
claim
--
whatever
action
the
commission
takes
in
regard
to
the
claim
is
final.
there
can't
be
any
court
action
to
review
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
by
mandamus
or
otherwise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i
--
i
was
trying
to
say
that
if
it
did
--
if
there
was
such
a
provision
then
it
could
possibly
get
into
the
category
where
it
would
get
into
a
federal
court,
it
could
get
into
an
article
3
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
had
lawyers
who
would
review
the
claim
in
the
first
instance.
and
then
in
the
limited
number
of
cases,
the
cases
were
appealed
to
the
commission
itself.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
the
commission
would
then
determine
the
--
the
claim
and
rule
on
it
and
that'd
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
end
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
record
doesn't
show
and
the
inquiry
i
made
was
so
sketchy
that
the
best
i
could
say
was
that
it
apparently
developed
the
facts
of
the
time
the
--
the
prisoner
or
internee
suffered
the
treatment
of
the
statute
provided
with
the
claim
would
be
allowed
for
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
the
hearings
--
my
understanding
was
none
--
this
is
--
are
not
accurate,
i'm
afraid.
that
it
was
a
preliminary
examination
and
then
there
was
an
opportunity
for
an
appeal
to
the
commission
itself
but
whether
there
was
a
de
novo
hearing,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
provision
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
there
is
none.
there
is
also
an
enlargement
of
some
of
the
powers
of
the
commission
two
years
later
in
which
of
us
given
the
authority
to
pass
on
claims
of
prisoners
of
war
based
upon
the
violation
of
title
3
of
section
3
of
the
geneva
convention
relating
to
the
labor
of
the
prisoner
of
war
and
inhumane
treatment
defined
as
including
but
not
limited
to
violations
of
certain
specific
articles
of
the
geneva
convention.
and
these
were
specifics
so
that
the
--
all
the
commission
had
to
determine
was
whether
or
not
they
came
within
those
specific
requirements.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
the
interest
of
the
government
in
the
case
is
the
--
in
the
basic
principle
of
the
conduct
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
and
the
authority
or
power
of
the
president
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
the
--
the
ability
to
remove
and
substitute
other
officers
in
the
executive
branch
that
will
respond
to
carrying
on
that
--
the
business
of
that
branch
of
the
government
in
the
best
management
possible.
and
it's
our
belief
that
under
the
take
care
that
the
laws
will
be
faithfully
executed
the
president
has
to
have
this
power
in
order
to
carry
out
the
obligations
imposed
upon
him
by
the
constitution.
now,
i
do
not
say
that
the
--
he
has
to
have
the
power
that's
denied
him
in
the
humphrey
case.
but
in
this
type
of
situation,
here
you
have
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
is
--
the
commission
is
actually
executing
or
carrying
out
the
legislative
or
judicial
function,
we
do
not
think
that
he
--
he
was
in
this
case.
but
even
assuming
that
he
was,
it
seems
that
there
should
be
a
power
in
the
executive
to
remove
any
officers
whose
conduct
he
is
responsible
for.
if
the
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
say
this
cannot
be
done
because
the
impeachment
process
is
so
unrealistic
to
handle
that
kind
of
a
problem
in
the
area
of
the
executive
branch
itself
and
the
responsibility
of
the
president
that
it
can't
be
assumed
that
it's
adequate.
and
furthermore,
the
congress
itself
has,
in
most
cases
provided
expressly
for
the
removal
on
various
specific
grounds
of
negligence
or
malfeasance
or
failure
to
carry
out
the
--
those
responsibilities
in
the
three
different
manners
time
after
time.
now,
its
hardly
conceivable
that
congress
would
have
been
intended
that
these
war
claims
commission
with
this
--
involving
this
$300
million
fund
that
they
would
pass
upon
these
claims
and
they're
also
passing
upon
not
only
that
aspect
of
whether
the
man
is
entitled
to
it.
but
they're
also
passing
upon
the
questions
of
foreign
relations
all
the
time
and
whether
or
not
some
foreign
country
violated
the
geneva
convention
because
if
they
don't
find
that,
the
man
is
entitled
to
the
blame
and
several
of
these
categories.
and
if
they
do
find
it,
then
they're
in
--
they're
right
down
in
the
heart
of
--
of
foreign
relations
problems
like
congress
had
seen
fit
in
--
before
and
time
after
time
provide
the
secretary
of
state
or
the
state
department
shall
have
control
of
that
situation
for
obvious
reasons.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
didn't
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
can
go
a
long
with
you
quite
of
ways
on
your
statement
and
that
seems
to
me
that
myers
does
hold
that
where
you're
dealing
with
the
executive
branch
itself
and
the
officers
that
the
president
is
responsible
for
that
there
cannot
be
a
limitation
to
power.
and
then
it
seems
to
me
that
humphrey
goes
into
the
question
of
the
function
of
the
activity,
but
it
also
analyzes
the
function
with
regard
to
being
quasi
legislative
and
quasi-judicial
and
you
will
recall
that
justice
(inaudible)
said,
“there
is
no
executive
activity
or
a
power
exercised
of
any
kind.”
and
there
might
be
some
question
about
whether
that
went
a
little
too
far
in
such
a
statement
as
that.
but
here,
this
is
not
by
its
nature,
a
court
action.
this
is
not
exercising
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
this
is
exercising
the
--
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
do
the
claim
comes
within
the
standards
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
an
award.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
this
--
this
requires
appropriation,
too.
but
you
see,
these
funds
were
actually
vested
funds
that
were
taken
from
enemy.
and
the
reparations
agreements
come
in
to
have
application
as
though
these
funds
were
belonging
to
the
enemy
and
to
pay
damages
that
the
enemy
did
to
these
various
individuals.
in
--
and
that
was
the
way
that
the
congress
was
treating
it
rather
than
in
the
concept
that
congress
was
voting
the
funds
of
the
united
states
to
be
applied
against
this
purpose.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
they
could
do
it
unless
they
would
get
it
into
some
form
that
was
a
controversy
or
case
except
to
treat
it
as
a
tucker
act
case
under
the
article
1
power.
if
they
would
treat
it
as
a
tucker
act
case,
then
they
could
but
then
it
--
they
wouldn't
be
exercising
a
judicial
function
as
distinguished
from
the
executive
function
of
--
of
just
passing
on
the
claims.
so,
we'd
get
into
a
controversy
in
this
particular
problem
if
there
was
a
provision
for
the
man
to
go
into
court
and
sue
the
united
states.
but
there
isn't
anything
like
that
and
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
it
isn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
just
about
have
to
relate
it
to
a
case
or
controversy
in
order
to
get
to
the
basic
exercise
of
judicial
power
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
under
the
decision
of
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
because
you
don't
have
the
ordinary
processes
in
the
court
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
maybe
a
due
process,
but
it
isn't
a
case
or
controversy
unless
you
have
an
adversary
proceeding
and
the
process
of
the
court
issued
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
don't
believe
the
criteria
are
defined
in
the
cases
before
the
court
of
claims
like
they
are
here.
there,
you
have
a
determination
of
the
facts
and
--
and
various
material
as
to
whether
or
not
it
comes
within
the
requirements
of
the
liabilities
as
fixed
by
the
congress
in
various
statutes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
this
--
this
is
actually
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
these
people
had
claims
not
against
the
united
states
at
all,
but
against
these
enemy
powers.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
there's
a
presumption
that
when
the
claim
was
asserted,
if
it
comes
within
the
requirements
of
the
statute
which
are
well
spelled
out
that
it
will
be
allowed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
true
here.
but
that
isn't
true
in
an
adversary
proceeding
that
there
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
an
adversary
proceeding?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
--
you
have
the
question
of
the
other
side
trying
to
prove
the
contrary
and
you
don't
have
that
here.
you
just
have
the
assertion
by
the
one
side
that
i
come
within
the
language
of
this
particular
statute
and
therefore,
the
presumption
is
that
the
moment
he
does
come
within
it,
he's
entitled
to
it
and
that
is
on
adversary
proceeding
while
the
other
is
entirely
different.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
at
the
present
time,
the
status
of
it
is
that
congress
has
said
by
this
legislation
that
it
will
not
be
returned
and
that
it
be
distributed
in
accordance
with
this
law
and
so
far
as
it's
necessary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
not
in
this
particular
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
litigation
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
vesting
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
questions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
those
--
those
are
passed
on
by
the
alien
property
custodian
and
then
there's
provision
for
an
appeal
and
so
forth
and
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
--
they
--
the
basis
of
theirs
is
that
they
were
held
prisoner
or
they
were
interned
or
they
received
inhumane
treatment
or
they
were
required
to
labor
in
violation
of
the
geneva
conventions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
if
they
established
whatever
the
statute
provides
in
regard
to
that,
there
--
it's
presumed
that
they
will
be
paid.
but
that's
entirely
different
from
the
case
or
controversy
in
the
judicial
system.
and
therefore,
it's
an
entirely
different
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
the
president
should
have
the
power
of
removal
of
the
commissioner.
now,
there
was
a
provision
in
this
statute
that
was
comparable
to
that
in
the
federal
trade
commission
case
and
that
was
a
requirement,
a
report
to
the
congress
which
was
made
through
the
president.
and
we
think
if
that
was
made
to
the
president,
is
no
--
makes
no
real
difference
about
that
being
a
function
as
an
agency
of
the
congress,
but
that
report
was
all
completed
before
this
petitioner
entered
to
find
his
office
at
all.
and
so,
we
think
that
that
cannot
be
relied
on
in
any
way.
now,
in
regard
to
the
quo
warranto,
this
action
as
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
--
we
claim
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
claim
that
humphrey
holds
that
if
the
intention
of
the
congress
has
been
made
clear
that
the
president
would
not
be
able
to
exercise
this
power
that
--
that
is
the
holding
of
it
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
where
there's
sounds
that
there
is
an
implied
power
out
of
the
power
to
appoint
and
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
this
quo
warranto
proceeding
was
brought
by
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court
against
the
new
appointees
to
the
commission
that
the
president
substituted.
and
in
that
proceeding,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
limitation
by
congress
upon
the
power
of
removal
and
an
appeal
was
taken
and
after
the
appeal
was
taken,
the
reorganization
act
was
approved
by
the
congress
and
it
expressly
did
brought
to
an
end
this
--
this
particular
commission
and
substituted
a
new
one
that
combined
--
that
a
commission
then
in
being
and
this
particular
commission
under
a
new
name
and
that
became
moot
at
that
time
then.
and
the
case
was
--
the
appeal
was
stipulated
to
be
dismissed
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
collateral
estoppel
and
conclusive
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
are
no
limitations
by
the
congress
on
the
power
of
the
president
to
remove
in
this
case.
and
this
court
has
held
to
that
effect
in
the
munsingwear
case
where
it
applied
this
rule
to
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
--
we
presented
the
question
in
our
answer
and
briefed
it
in
the
court
of
claims
and
we
think
that
it
is
conclusive,
not
on
--
on
the
question
of
whether
he
can
sue
for
payment
which
is
a
different
claim
than
the
quo
warranto
but
is
conclusive
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
president
to
remove
because
that's
exactly
what
the
quo
warranto
proceeding
involved
and
we
say
it's
a
substance
rather
than
a
form
of
a
proceeding
that
counts.
and
that
in
fact
the
united
states
was
the
--
the
real
party
or
at
least
of
privity
in
that
proceeding.
therefore,
it
was
the
same
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
the
--
the
incumbents
were
claiming
they
had
a
right
to
the
office
and
the
petitioner
was
claiming
that
they
had
no
right
because
he
was
occupying
it
and
it
was
that
question
that
the
united
states
of
course
was
the
--
that
party
of
real
interest
as
to
the
proper
construction
of
this
principle
on
the
right
of
removal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
the
--
the
holding
was
expressly
that
there
was
no
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
president
to
remove.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
isn't
squarely
res
judicata,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
has
a
bearing
that
the
court
might
very
well
conclude
that
it
wasn't
conclusive
in
this
particular
matter
and
that
it
was
still
had
to
pass
on
the
rest
of
the
questions
in
the
case.
if
--
it
isn't
a
square
res
judicata
because
the
courts
of
claims
has
held
in
a
number
of
case
that
we
cite
in
the
brief
that
they're
still
free
to
bring
this
action,
not
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
but
a
similar
type
of
action
for
the
amount
of
salary
they
would
have
received
even
though
they
do
not
win
their
case
about
reinstatement
before
the
district
of
columbia.
so,
it's
a
question
that
has
not
been
determined
squarely
and
the
court
of
claims
has
held
otherwise
in
several
cases.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
should've
been
because
i
think
it's
kind
of
a
point
that
the
court
may
address
itself
to
without
reaching
the
constitutional
questions
if
it
finds
it
to
conclude
the
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
isn't
quite
congress.
it
was
a
reorganization
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
plan
that
congress
did
approve
of
course.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
it
was
stipulated
by
the
parties
that
the
appeal
was
moot
by
reason
of
that
action
of
it.
but
it
was
never
vacated
or
reversed
or
disposed
of.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
but
this
court
rejected
that
in
the
guthrie
case,
this
court
rejected
that
idea
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
moot
and
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
munsingwear
case
where
it
referred
to
professor
scott's
article
in
harvard
law
review
and
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
couldn't
get
relief
because
it
was
moot
was
not
sufficient
justification.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
government
was
in
exactly
this
spot
in
the
munsingwear
case
and
the
court
said
that
it
could
have
applied
to
have
had
the
case
vacated
and
reversed
and
failed
to
do
so
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
i'm
quite
sure
it
wasn't
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
it
was
clearly
--
it
was
a
--
it
was
moot
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
--
i
couldn't
answer
that.
this
was
done
by
a
stipulation
also
that
it
might
have
been
different
in
that
the
parties
did
know
more
than
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
couldn't
tell
you
what
the
practice
was,
but
this
was
done
by
a
stipulation
which
might
make
it
different
than
the
court
would
ordinarily
follow.
it
was
left
on
its
own.
that's
what
i
want
to
make
clear.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
--
the
transcript
doesn't
seem
to
show
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
in
the
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
where
do
we
have
to
argue?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
start
on
page
68
and
we
go
through
69
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
70.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
i'm
advised
by
counsel
that
the
stipulation
was
made
between
the
parties
and
that
there
was
no
order
entered
upon
it.
i
assume
that
under
the
federal
rules
that
it's
supposed
to
be
as
a
matter
of
course.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
all
i
can
relate
is
what
i
was
told
about
it
when
i
inquired
about
the
difference
between
this
being
a
equitable
estoppel
and
the
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata.
and
res
judicata
would
dispose
of
the
cause
while
the
equitable
or
collateral
estoppel
might
very
well
not
dispose
of
the
entire
rights.
the
problem
is
that
they're
asking
for
reinstatement
in
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
the
procedure,
i
handled
those
cases.
and
that
is
an
independent
right
that
they
have
under
the
law
whether
they
later
sue
for
amount
of
salary
or
wages
during
the
interim
or
not
and
if
they're
denied
the
reinstatement,
they
might
still
obtain
the
payment
depending
upon
the
action
which
is
not
the
same
action.
it's
an
independent
right
that
is
--
has
been
denied
them,
they
claim
in
the
court
of
claims.
so,
res
judicata
would
be
if
it
was
exactly
the
same
right
is
being
demanded
in
both
courts
then
the
proof.
i'm
advised
by
mr.
davis
who
has
worked
for
this
matter
that
the
court
of
claims
has
held
there
is
no
res
judicata
and
we
have
acquiesced
in
that
position
of
the
court
of
claims.
but
there
is
a
difference
in
regard
to
collateral
estoppel.
and
we
have
tried
to
make
it
very
clear
in
this
brief
that
we
think
that
the
petitioner
is
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
court,
the
court,
the
district
court
of
the
district
on
this
element
that
there
was
no
limitations
on
--
on
the
president's
power.
now,
insofar
as
that
is
an
element
in
this
case,
we
think
that's
decided,
but
it
may
not
be
decisive
with
the
court
if
i
make
that
point
clearer.
we
did
call
the
court's
attention
to
it
in
our
opposition
as
far
as
a
footnote
but
it
wasn't
adequate
for
the
development
it
made
here
(inaudible).
