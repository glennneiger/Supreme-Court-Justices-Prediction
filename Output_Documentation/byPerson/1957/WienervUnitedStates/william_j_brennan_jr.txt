william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wachtel,
you're
not
going
to
deal
with
res
judicata
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
they
adversary
hearings
mr.
solicitor,
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
could
if
they
are
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
or
cannot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
cannot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
have
that
in
mind.
i
have
in
mind
that
a
proceeding
before
the
war
claims
commission
itself.
is
that
--
is
that
an
adversary
proceeding
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
did
the
--
the
commission
if
you
can
tell
us
shortly,
actually
deal
with
the
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
the
commission
sit
and
hear
evidence
in
that
respect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
before
you
get
to
that
mr.
solicitor,
if
in
fact
the
--
the
functions
of
this
commission
are
in
any
event
nonexecutive
in
character,
would
you
raise
a
power
of
removal
out
of
the
power
of
appointment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
light
of
the
silence
that
is
of
the
congress
on
the
issue
of
removal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
here
we
have
silence,
completely.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
place
or
you
have
imply
it
from
the
power
to
appoint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
alone.
that's
the
only
place
upon
which
you
could
hang
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
then
the
original
district
court's
judgment
to
this
case
was
favorable
to
the
defendant,
was
never
vacated
upon
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal
for
mootness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
how
is
the
united
states
in
privity,
the
--
it
was
the
incumbents
who
were
the
defendants,
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
of
becauses
united
states
defends
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
spell
out
privity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
best
way,
it
was
predicated
on
the
president's
power
of
removal
and
the
verdict
favorable
to
the
defendants
necessarily
had
to
determine
that
issue
favorably
to
the
government's
position
because
that
did
have
a
power,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
--
we
don't
have
in
the
record
i
think
the
--
either
the
stipulation
of
dismissal
or
any
order
that
the
--
entered
on
--
there
on
it,
there
was
one,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suppose
we
could
have
both
the
stipulation
in
any
order
that
may
have
been
entered
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
noticed
that
if
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
certificate
(voice
overlap)
(inaudible)
case
was
on
august
10,
(voice

and
dismissed
under
rule
21.
and
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
just
a
local
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
which,
you
mean
vacate
the
action
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
physically
the
original
order
is
still
--
is
on
file
in
the
district
court,
stands
unvacated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
