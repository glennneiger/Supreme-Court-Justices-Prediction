justice

somebody
would
have
to
determine
the
facts,
how
long
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
been
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
amount
to
be
determined
would
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
more
like
a
court
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
view
of
your
law
of
that
determination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
section
11
provided
for
a
hearing
in
the
usual
words
of
the
provisions
for
hearings
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
they
have
to
go
to
the
court?
i
--
i
asked
you
that
for
this
reason,
some
through
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
provides
that
a
submission
can
receive
an
adjudicated
claim,
but
they
do
so
after
hearing
with
the
right
to
summon
witnesses.
it
provides
also
to
receive
and
determine
according
to
law
the
amount
and
validity
and
when
they
reached
that
determination,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
must
pay
it.
what's
the
difference
in
that
in
the
language
of
a
state
judicial
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
under
article
3,
but
on
--
under
the
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
be
a
case
of
controversy?
has
it
been
determined,
determined
under
law,
determined
at
the
hearing,
must
render
a
judgment
after
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
it
if
they're
entitled
to
hearing,
and
we
held
time
and
time
again
that
that
means
a
hearing
should
be
heard,
either
for
--
give
the
evidence,
you
can't
decide
it
without
notice
and
so
forth
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
isn't
as
much
an
adversary
proceeding
as
a
case
against
the
government
itself
that
goes
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
case
or
controversy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
this
is,
to
receive
and
determine
according
to
law
the
amount
and
validity
of
the
claim.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
a
claim,
a
claim
that
--
by
which
there's
a
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
that
true
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
presume
that
if
you
can
prove
your
case
and
it
comes
under
the
law,
your
claim
will
be
allowed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
relief
could
have
been
granted,
could
it?
no
relief
could
have
been
granted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
out
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
which
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
couldn't
they
get
relief
there?
why
was
it
moot
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
mootness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
was
the
mootness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
the
legislating
out
office
by
the
government
agency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
quite
a
different
issue
to
this
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
case
was
dismissed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
a
person
or
a
defendant
dies,
is
that
case
used
to
a
basis
on
the
ground
of
mootness
on
the
background
of
death?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
evidence
considered
moot
because
he
died?
would
that
change
the
cause
of
action,
if
there
is
any?
the
munsingwear
case
was
on
mootness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
law
was
changed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
what
(inaudible)
are
different?
