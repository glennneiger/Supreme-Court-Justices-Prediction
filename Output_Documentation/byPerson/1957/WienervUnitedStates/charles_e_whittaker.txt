justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
with
reference
to
this
collateral
estoppel
point,
i
noticed
on
page
7
of
your
reply
brief,
you
say
that
the
stipulation
was
made
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
then
you
set
forth
in
the
agreement
and
the
agreement
says
that
the
cause
is
to
be
dismissed.
do
you
make
any
distinction
out
of
that
fact?
