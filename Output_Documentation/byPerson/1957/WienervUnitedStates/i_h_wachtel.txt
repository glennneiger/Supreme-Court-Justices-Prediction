mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
truly
with
a
deep
feeling
of
humility,
that
i
come
before
the
court
to
ask
you
to
consider
and
pass
upon
a
question
that
has
remained
unanswered
since
the
date
of
the
constitutional
convention.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
real
dispute.
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
war
claims
commission.
by
the
terms
of
the
act,
the
commission
was
to
expire
upon
completion
of
its
work,
but
in
no
event,
later
than
march
of
1955.
in
december
of
1953,
after
a
representative
of
the
president
had
asked
the
petitioner
and
other
members
of
commission
to
resign,
and
upon
their
refusal
to
resign,
the
president
notified
the
commissioner,
one
of
the
other
members
of
the
commission,
the
third
member
having
died
in
the
interim
that
he
was
removed
from
office
in
order
that
the
president
might
complete
the
administration
of
the
act
with
personnel
of
his
own
selection.
interestingly
enough,
the
language
of
this
letter,
almost
verbatim,
the
language
used
by
the
president
when
he
sought
to
remove
mr.
humphrey's
from
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
petitioner
notified
the
president
that
he
felt
the
president
lack
the
power
to
remove
him.
that
he
would
continue
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
and
available
to
perform
the
duties
of
his
office
and
questioned
the
president's
power.
notwithstanding
this,
the
president
issued
appointments,
the
three
individuals
to
serve
as
members
of
the
war
claims
commission.
thereafter,
the
petitioner
requested
the
attorney
general
and
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
commenced
quo
warranto
proceedings
for
the
purpose
of
determining
wether
or
not
these
three
individuals
were
properly
in
office
or
whether
or
not
they
were
usurpers.
the
attorney
general
and
the
u.s.
attorney
refused
to
intercede.
an
application
was
made
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
colombia,
and
an
old-fashioned
writ
of
quo
warrato
was
issued
pursuant
to
the
order
of
judge
mcguire.
the
u.s.
marshal
served
this
writ
on
the
three
individual
respondents
and
no
one
else.
thereafter,
the
department
of
justice
appeared
as
attorney
of
record
for
the
three
individual
respondents.
on
motion
to
the
summary
judgment
--
cross
motion
from
summary
judgment,
as
mr.
justice
kern
ruled
that
the
removal
of
the
petitioner
here
or
the
relator
in
that
case,
was
within
the
scope
of
the
president's
power
and
dismissed
the
petition.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
before
the
record
had
been
printed,
the
congress
having
failed
to
act
within
the
60
days
time
provided
by
the
legislator
of
reorganization
act,
resolution
of
the
president
became
effective
and
the
war
claims
commission
was
abolished.
when
this
occurred,
a
stipulation
and
agreement
was
signed
by
the
attorney
for
the
appellant
and
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
agreeing
that
the
issue
would
become
moot
and
concerning
to
a
dismissal
of
the
case.
the
very
words
of
that
agreement
appears
in
our
reply
brief.
thereafter,
the
petitioner
here
in
his
own
name
acting
for
himself
pursuant
to
the
provisions,
title
28
of
the
judicial
code,
brought
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims
for
his
salary,
for
the
period
during
which
he
was
prevented
from
performing
his
duties.
in
that
action,
he
pleaded,
established
his
appointment
that
he
was
duly
performing
his
duties.
that
the
work
of
the
commission
had
not
been
completed
that
his
term
had
not
expired
and
that
nevertheless,
he
had
been
removed
by
the
president
and
that
such
removal
was
illegal
contrary
to
law
and
beyond
the
scope
of
the
president's
authority.
the
findings
of
facts
is
essentially
along
the
lines
i
have
just
enumerated,
or
handed
down
by
the
court
of
claims.
and
in
its
decision
on
the
merits,
it
found
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
a
body
performing
a
quasi
legislative
and
quasi
judicial
function.
that
the
act
under
which
he
had
been
appointed
and
under
which
he
was
serving
contained
no
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
president
to
remove
him.
and
that
accordingly,
the
president
properly
removed
the
petitioner.
mr
justice
whittaker
of
the
court
of
claims
dissented
and
took
the
view
that
before
we
could
determine
whether
or
not
the
court
of
claims
--
whether
the
court
of
claims
is
right
in
holding
that
the
congress
did
not
limit
the
president's
power
to
remove
the
petitioner
in
view
of
the
nature
of
his
functions
we
must
first
determine
whether
or
not
the
president
posses
any
power
which
could
be
limited.
it
was
judge
whittaker's
position
and
it's
the
position
we
take
here,
that
the
president
did
not
posses
any
constitutional
or
statutory
authority
to
remove
the
petitioner.
the
act
being
silent
as
to
any
express
grounds
for
removal,
the
act
being
silent
as
to
any
express
grant
of
power
to
remove
and
silent
as
to
any
denial
of
the
power
to
remove,
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
act
neither
granted
the
president
the
power
to
remove
the
petitioner,
he
lacked
any
to
power
to
remove
the
petitioner
and
therefore,
his
removal
was
illegal.
now,
as
we
view
the
issues
before
the
court,
we
respectfully
suggest,
and
to
this
extent,
may
agree
with
--
with
government
counsel
that
it
maybe
possible
for
the
court
not
to
reach
this
very
important
constitutional
question.
if
the
war
claims
act,
by
its
language
from
its
history,
will
be
or
can
be
construed
as
providing
a
term
of
office
which
could
not
be
curtailed
without
cause
and
which
could
not
be
curtailed
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president.
then
this
court,
if
it
should
find
that
the
petitioner
was
that
ephemeral
purely
executive
officer
that
this
court
talked
about
in
the
humphrey
case.
if
it
should
find
that
he
is
that
type
of
an
officer,
then
we
say
to
the
court
that
if
he
chooses
to
follow
that
line
of
reasoning,
that
the
president
possesses
an
unrestrictable
power
to
remove
a
purely
executive
officer.
and
we
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
question.
but
if,
as
i
say,
the
court
should
find
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
pardon?
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
say,
there
is
no
question
about
that
if
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
that
maybe
so,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
should
find
and
construe
the
act,
the
language
of
the
act
as
providing
a
term
of
office,
which
by
its
language
and
its
legislative
history
did
not
authorize
the
curtailment
of
the
term
without
cause
or
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president,
we
must
then
proceed
to
the
determination
of
the
nature
and
character
of
the
function
of
the
commission.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
the
statute
is
completely
silent,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
no,
no,
your
honor,
because
if
we
follow
the
line
of
cases
in
which
this
court
has
enunciated
the
doctrine
that
given
as
to
executive
officers,
purely
executive
officers
that
--
given
a
term
--
given
a
term
without
any
language
in
the
act
providing
grounds
for
removal
that
before
the
president
could
remove,
he
must
do
so
on
notice
and
give
--
and
a
hearing
which
is
what
it
in
effect
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
at
one
point
and
also
in
the
reagan
case.
now,
i
must
confess
to
the
court
that
had
the
president
had
good
cause
here,
we
would
have
had
an
entirely
different
case.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
this
act
says
that
the
term
of
office
shall
expire
when
the
work
of
the
commission
is
finished.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
say,
if
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
correct,
unless
congress
enumerate
it.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
correct.
and
--
and
that
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
we
--
we
say
and
i
continue
to
use
the
term
without
cause,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
the
president
in
his
letter
talks
about
in
the
national
interest,
completing
that
his
administration,
to
complete
the
administration
of
the
act.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
issue
of
removal
for
cause
nor
does
the
act
itself
enumerate
causes.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
correct.
the
--
the
point
we
want
to
make,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
assume
that
a
member
of
congress
or
assume
that
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
was
derelict
in
his
duty,
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
under
the
president's
power
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
land,
he
has
no
right
to
do
anything
about
removing
such
officials.
so
that,
i
think
we
get
back
to
the
very
fundamental
issue
which
we
had
thought
has
been
clearly
decided
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
from
the
nature
of
the
government's
brief
in
our
position
for
our
petition
for
cert,
that
would
not
be
argued
here,
and
that
is
precisely
what
is
the
nature
of
the
agency
that
we
have
here.
for
if
this
a
agency
is
performing
a
function
which
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
president's
duties
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
land.
if
what
this
commission
was
doing
was
discharging
or
effectuating
the
president's
power,
we
say
to
you,
then
the
president
should
have
had
the
right
to
remove
this
man.
and
if
congress
attempted
to
restrict
him
than
under
the
myers
case,
he
was
such
a
purely
executive
officer
as
to
whom
the
president
possessed
unrestrictable
power
of
removal.
but
we
submit
to
you
that
from
the
very
founding
days
of
our
government,
this
function,
this
power
which
the
petitioner
and
the
other
members
of
the
commission
were
discharging
and
effectuating
what
traditionally
and
classically
legislative
and
judicial
function.
if
we
look
at
the
atmosphere
that
existed
in
1945
and
in
1946
when
the
congress
was
considering
this
legislation,
we
can
understand
better
what
congress
had
in
mind
here.
here
was
a
powerful
country,
for
the
second
time
in
its
history,
its
territory
was
invaded
by
a
foreign
power.
its
nationals
and
citizens
were
imprisoned,
their
property
taken,
government
buildings
taken,
moneys,
assets,
credits,
life,
liberty
taken
away
from
them.
new
concepts
existed,
series
of
genocide,
war
guilt,
war
criminal.
in
this
atmosphere,
the
congress
realized
and
recognized
that
it
had
an
entirely
different
situation
than
it
had
ever
had
in
the
history
of
the
country,
except
perhaps
in
a
small
degree
during
the
war
of
1812.
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
long
history,
starting
with
the
french
attacks
on
american
commerce
during
the
napoleonic
wars.
the
spanish
claims
in
florida.
the
mexican
claims
in
the
war
of
1848,
the
claims
of
the
spanish-american
war,
the
war
of
18
--
the
war
of
1917.
in
each
instance,
congress
to
some
degree
was
confronted
with
what
to
do
for
its
citizens
and
national
who
had
suffered
to
a
larger
extent
or
to
a
larger
degree
than
anyone
else
from
the
rigors
of
war.
in
many
respects,
the
situation
at
the
world
war
ii
is
similar.
but
in
the
scope,
in
the
nature
of
the
claims
that
it
was
confronted
with,
it
was
an
entirely
new
problem.
when
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
settled
with
the
french
and
received
substantial
sums
of
money
after
the
napoleonic
wars
for
damage,
not
to
property
of
the
government
as
a
government,
but
the
property
of
its
citizens.
the
congress
took
the
money
and
put
it
in
the
treasury.
and
then
through
one
hearing
after
another,
it
took
the
position
that
it
held
no
legal
or
equitable
obligation
to
refund
or
repay
this
money
to
its
citizens.
it
was
not
until
many
years
later,
long
after
the
united
states
court
of
claims
had
been
established
that
the
congress
delegated
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims
the
responsibility
for
hearing
and
determining
a
right
which
the
congress
had
created.
the
amount
of
money
that
a
given
individual
or
company
was
entitled
to
receive
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states.
it
did
the
same
thing
with
the
spanish
foliation
claims
after
the
incident
in
florida.
it
did
precisely
the
same
thing
after
the
mexican
war.
it
did
substantially
the
same
thing
after
the
spanish-american
war,
except
that
instead
of
delegating
the
determination
of
these
rights
to
the
court
of
claims,
it
set
up
commissions.
after
the
civil
war
when
it
had
received
a
very
substantial
settlement
from
the
british
government
for
the
activities
of
the
alabama
and
other
vessels
who
raided
during
the
civil
war,
it
set
up
by
special
court
of
alabama
claims
commissioners,
appointed
by
the
president
to
serve
for
a
given
term,
to
perform
this
given
function.
when
we
come,
however,
to
world
war
i,
we
find
a
little
different
situation.
there,
we
find
a
commission
appointed
not
to
determine
which
national
or
which
citizen
shall
receive
or
be
entitled
to
obtain
any
of
this
money,
but
a
commission
which
had
to
determine
first
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
liability
of
germany.
in
that
event,
a
mixed
claims
commission
was
set
up,
and
as
government
counsel
points
out,
it
had
a
very
unfortunate
history.
it
took
many,
many
years.
many
disputes
and
many
arguments
before
any
resolution
was
made
and
in
fact,
there
--
maybe
some
claims
still
pending.
therefore,
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
1946
was
again
confronted
with
this
problem,
it
immediately
recognized
not
only
the
many
difficulties
it
had
had
in
the
past,
but
the
magnitude
of
this
problem.
it
realized
that
if
it
attempted
to
sit
down
as
it
had
prior
to
the
reorganization
act,
and
act
--
and
pass
on
every
claim
that
came
before
it
to
be
reimbursed
for
a
house
that
was
damaged,
a
hospital
that
was
ruined,
for
a
church
building
that
had
been
destroyed,
that
the
congress
would
never
get
its
work
done.
it
realized
the
complexity
of
this
--
of
this
problem.
as
a
matter
fact,
it
didn't
even
know
how
to
define
war
claims.
and
in
its
report
supporting
this
legislation,
it
specifically
said
that
it
left
the
very
definition
of
war
claims
to
this
body
which
it
was
creating.
it
therefore,
when
it
would
set
up
the
war
claims
commission,
had
two
basic
functions
in
mind.
it
first
wanted
a
framework
of
facts
within
which
it
could
make
this
basic
determination.
the
political
question
is
how
to
go
from
there
was
the
traditional
function
of
congress.
when
the
house
originally
adopted
the
legislation
and
sent
it
to
the
senate,
it
contained
nothing
more
than
a
provision
for
creation
of
a
commission
which
would
find
the
facts,
which
would
classify
the
claims
and
make
recommendations
to
the
congress.
it
was
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
that
the
need
for
honoring
certain
categories
of
claims
were
manifested.
and
it
was
--
as
a
result
of
the
action
of
the
senate,
that
this
body
was
clothed
with
the
additional
function
of
adjudicating
these
claims
according
to
law.
it
is
this
type
of
body
performing
these
functions
which
we
urge
to
the
court
are
entirely
legislative,
are
entirely
judicial
in
function.
and
i'd
like
parenthetically
to
say
when
i
urge
that
they
are
judicial
in
function,
i
am
not
talking
of
the
judicial
power
under
article
3
of
the
constitution.
i
am
talking
instead
of
the
judicial
function
of
a
legislative
court,
of
the
court
of
claims,
which
basically
is
adjudicating
only
those
claims
for
which
congress
has
created
a
right
and
a
remedy.
i
suggest
to
--
say
to
the
court
that
this
is
the
type
of
agency
that
we
have
here.
the
functions
that
it
was
performing
were
not
traditionally
the
functions
of
the
executive
branch.
the
duties
imposed
upon
it
by
congress
in
the
past
were
always
performed
by
these
independent
bodies.
in
this
context
then,
can
we
say
that
there
is
a
provision
in
the
constitution,
from
which
can
be
spelled
out
or
implied
the
necessity
and
the
duty
for
the
president
to
interfere
in
the
work
of
that
agency?
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
chief
justice,
prior
to
the
recess,
i
had
set
forth
the
historical
basis
for
our
view
that
this
agency
was
a
legislative
and
judicial
body.
i'm
aware
of
the
language
of
this
court
and
other
tribunals
the
use
of
the
term
quasi,
quasi
legislative,
the
quasi-judicial,
the
tendency
to
label.
i
suggest
that
the
court
--
that
war
claims
commission
in
this
case
was
truly
an
offspring
of
the
legislative
--
legislature
performing
its
functions,
performing
duties
traditionally
those
of
the
congress,
performing
in
the
cause
with
those
activities
functions
of
a
judicial
character.
in
the
humphrey's
case,
this
court
had
held
that
--
that
congress
had
us
an
appropriate
incident
of
its
power,
the
power
to
fix
the
period
during
which
they
shall
continue
and
to
forbid
their
removal
except
for
cause
in
the
meantime.
in
all
respects,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
agency
here
is
far
more,
if
i
may
use
the
term
a
quasi-legislative
and
quasi-judicial
agency
then
in
the
federal
trade
commission
situation.
we
think
the
sole
distinction
in
this
case,
not
in
the
federal
trade
commission
case,
the
humphrey's
case
was
that
in
the
humphrey's
case
congress
fixed
the
term
--
they
fixed
the
term
here.
but
in
the
humphrey's
case
it
enumerated
certain
causes
for
removal.
in
the
instant
case,
the
statute
is
completely
silent.
it
enumerates
no
causes
for
removal.
we
say
--
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
in
this
case,
it's
evident
and
it
should
be
considered
evident
that
congress
intended
that
there'd
be
no
power
of
removal
in
the
present.
the
lesson
we
feel
that
must
be
learned
of
the
humphrey
case
teaches
us
is
that
the
president
has
no
inherent
power,
no
implied
power
over
this
type
of
agency
by
virtue
of
the
vesting
of
the
power
of
appointment
in
it.
we
feel
that
he
has
over
such
agencies
only
such
power
as
congress
gives
him
because
if
as
this
court
said
he
does
not
possess
an
illimitable
power.
in
order
to
possess
any
power,
it
must
come
from
some
place.
it
cannot
come
solely
from
the
vesting
of
the
power
of
appointment
because
congress
could
easily
have
vested
the
power
of
appointment
in
the
head
of
the
department.
we
say
that
the
mere
vesting
of
the
appointment
does
not
imply
the
power
to
remove
because
the
whole
concept
of
the
implied
power
of
removal
was
its
necessity,
the
need
for
it
for
the
president
to
carry
out
his
duties
and
obligations.
but
the
duties
and
obligations
other
than
those
fixed
in
the
constitution
that
the
president
possesses
what
congress
gives
him.
i
suggest
the
--
to
the
court
that
this
isn't
a
case
of
congress
limiting
or
failing
to
limit
power.
that
in
this
area
in
dealing
and
creating
this
type
of
agencies,
what
congress
does
is
fix
the
conditions
under
which
this
agency
shall
operate.
it
fixes
the
conditions
under
which
the
president
may
impinge
on
the
functions
of
this
agency.
the
sole
power
given
to
the
president
was
the
power
to
nominate
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
appoint.
having
performed
that
duty,
this
agency
under
the
basic
concept
of
the
functions
and
separation
of
power
was
to
remain
free
and
unhampered
by
any
action
or
activity
of
the
president
in
performing
truly
legislative
and
judicial
powers.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
your
honor.
and
which
could
be
implemented
from
time
to
time
by
further
appropriations.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
your
--
your
honor,
just
ask
me
two
questions.
the
--
the
funds
where
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
under
the
jurisdiction
of
a
depository
like
a
bank,
the
treasury
of
the
united
states.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
no,
not
on
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
no.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
it
--
it
was
the
same
if
i
may
use
the
illustration,
your
honor,
of
my
right
to
issue
a
draft
against
funds
in
the
bank.
if
the
draft
was
in
proper
order,
in
this
case,
if
the
certificate
of
the
war
claims
commission
was
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
oh.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
there
were
funds
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
only
the
congress.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
not
of
this
nature,
your
honor.
there
were
other
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
there
was
a
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
the
disposition
of
the
fund
is
covered
by
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act.
and
i'm
not
prepared
your
honor
to
give
you
in
detail
each
of
the
functions
describing
the
act.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
not
unless
congress
authorized
it,
no.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
correct.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
think
it
could,
yes.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
he
could.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
it
could.
now,
the
question
whether
that
would
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
sir.
but
i
don't
think
we've
had
it
determined
whether
that
was
a
valid
delegation
of
authority.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes.
yes,
precisely
like
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
it
could
have.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
no,
i
--
i
don't.
it
does
not,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
congress
has
time
--
time
delegated
many
activities
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
these
activities
may
necessarily
not
have
been
truly
legislative
functions.
i
think
every
time
that
the
congress
enacts
any
law
when
it
provides
by
statute
that
certain
acts
are
in
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
definition
to
what
is
a
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act
is
a
legislative
function.
the
enforcement
to
that
function,
it
delegated
to
the
executive
branch.
it
could
just
as
well
have
delegated
the
determination
of
those
facts
to
a
court
and
that
wouldn't
have
made
it
any
the
less
a
judicial
function.
the
mere
fact
that
congress
in
its
wisdom
delegates
some
of
its
functions
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
gives
the
president
full
power
over
that
agency
or
that
individual
isn't
precisely
the
situation
we
have
here
because
when
it
delegates
that
function,
it
can
also
set
forth
the
conditions
under
which
that
function
shall
be
performed.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
no,
no
i'm
not
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
i
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
i
have
been
unable,
if
your
honor
please,
to
find
legislation
where
the
congress
has
delegated
to
the
treasury
or
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
definition
and
the
determination
of
the
rights
of
an
individual.
its
congress
which
created
--
creates
the
right
to
get
the
funds
and
it's
congress
which
sets
up
the
remedy.
until
congress
creates
the
right
and
provides
the
remedy
and
there
have
been
classic
illustrations
where
congress
has
given
the
right
without
a
remedy.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
if
your
honor
is
talking
now
about
the
district
court
judges
in
the
same
category
as
the
court
of
claims
or
the
tax
court,
i
--
i
think
we
have
to
define
and
point
out
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
then
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
this
court
has
never
precisely
decided
that
question.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
it
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
its
--
it's
my
view,
if
it
please
the
court,
if
i
give
my
view.
i
say
that
following
the
philosophy
that
i
think
underlies
the
court's
decisions
in
the
few
cases
that
we've
had
of
territorial
judges.
the
direct
question
wasn't
met
because
in
those
cases,
in
the
case
of
the
minnesota
judge
and
the
case
of
the
alaska
judge,
the
issue
wasn't
raise
in
minnesota,
the
act
specifically
gave
the
president
power
to
name
his
--
to
remove
him
by
naming
his
successor.
i
think
in
the
alaska
case,
the
mcallister
case,
all
that
the
judge
was
interested
in
there
was
his
salary
from
the
time
of
his
removal
to
the
time
of
the
appointment
of
the
successor.
but
other
cases
have
indicated
--
indicate
that
this
court
has
felt
that
the
congress
in
creating
the
courts
and
the
territories
was
not
creating
a
court
under
article
3
of
the
constitution
but
rather
under
the
provision
of
the
constitution
which
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
pass
all
laws
needful
for
the
operation
of
the
territories.
and
i
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
as
this
court
has
so
held
and
has
so
indicated
in
the
o'donoghue
case
and
in
the
williams
case.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
think
he
has
no
power
unless
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well,
except
this,
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
please,
the
congress
in
--
in
setting
up
this
territorial
codes
in
the
past
except
in
the
cases
of
puerto
rico
and
hawaii
and
the
virgin
islands.
in
all
the
of
the
prior
acts
as
--
at
least
those
i
have
been
able
to
find,
it
specifically
gave
the
president
power
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
it
might
not
be
too
great
to
jump
in
reasoning,
your
honor,
but
i
--
as
a
lawyer
i'm
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
don't
have
doubt
about
this,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
no,
i
don't
have
any
doubt
at
all
about
the
court
of
claims'
judges
this
court
has
already
ruled.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
--
i
don't
think
he
could
be
removed
and
your
honor
this
i
think
is
the
--
perhaps
the
most
trouble
some
part
of
this
case.
i
don't
think
the
president
could
remove.
i
think
we
would
have
to
resort
to
impeachment
but
that
doesn't
shock
me
anymore
than
it
does
the
difficulty
to
remove
a
judge.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
--
i've
been
unable
to
find
any
cases
that
would
help
me
to
perform
the
judicial
function
of
rendering
a
judge.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
thought
i
would
leave
that
for
my
rebuttal,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
don't
mean
to
be
suspicious
about
a
very
important
case
like
this,
but
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
some
75
or
a
100
regular
practitioners
in
the
court
of
claims
would
like
very
much
to
know
that
this
is
the
position
the
government
takes
on
res
adjudicata,
because
scores
--
scores,
literally
scores
of
paid
cases
in
the
court
of
claims
determined
in
the
courts,
the
district
courts
in
favor
of
an
employee
of
being
re-litigated
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
very
question
of
the
first
right
to
remove
him.
and
if
the
government
is
right
that
this
is
res
adjudicata,
then
i
can
say
that
every
case
where
the
government
has
won
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
has
upheld
the
right
to
discharge
that
all
of
these
people
are
going
to
lose
their
cases.
because
in
the
court
of
claims
today,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
in
the
district
court
proceedings,
the
united
states
of
america
is
not
a
party.
i
hesitated
before
to
render
a
judgment
in
response
to
an
inquiry
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
if
we
are
going
to
continue
to
maintain
the
fiction
that
when
a
suit
was
brought
against
mr.
sawyer,
the
secretary
of
commerce
is
--
was
in
the
steel
case,
that
it
was
not
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
it
was
going
to
follow
the
concepts
that
we
did
in
lukens
steel
and
larson
versus
foreign
and
domestic
commerce.
but
these
are
suits
against
an
individual
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
law
and
these
suits
are
not
binding
on
the
united
states
of
america.
this
is
the
position
this
court
has
taken
and
it's
a
position
which
the
department
of
justice
takes
consistently
in
the
court
of
claims
that
every
time
a
veteran,
a
government
employee
is
successful
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
has
no
authority
to
order
him
back
to
work.
all
it
can
say,
he
was
improperly
removed,
failure
to
comply
perhaps
with
the
veteran's
preference
act
or
any
one
of
a
number
of
reasons.
when
that
employee
wins
in
the
district
court,
he
knows
inevitably
he
can't
get
back
on
the
payroll,
but
all
he
can
do
is
now
go
into
the
court
of
claims
and
get
a
judgment
for
x
dollars
from
that
time
on
until
the
date
of
judgment.
and
the
government
has
regularly
as
it
did
in
this
case,
as
it
does
all
the
time
come
into
the
court
of
claims
and
take
the
position,
“we
were
not
a
party
to
the
suit
in
the
district
court.
you
didn't
sue
the
united
states
of
america
because
you
couldn't
sue
the
united
states
of
america.”
it
didn't
give
its
consent
to
be
sued.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
it's
generally
on
the
grounds
of
death
if
it's
an
action
which
abates
with
that.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
in
the
--
in
the
munsingwear
case,
if
your
honor
please,
what
had
happened
was
that
the
government,
the
price
control
administrator
had
withdrawn
the
regulation.
he
had
a
suit
pending
in
the
district
court
for
treble
damages
and
for
injunctive
relief.
he
held
up
the
suit
for
treble
damages
trying
to
get
injunctive
relief
to
try
to
stop
munsingwear
from
allegedly
violating
an
opa
regulation.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
while
the
case
was
on
appeal,
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
opa
withdrew
the
regulations
that
there
was
nothing
to
enjoin.
there
was
no
stipulation
on
the
court,
the
court
itself
in
its
decision
dismissed
on
the
grounds
and
mootness.
when
they
went
back
to
try
the
fundamental
question
of
treble
damages,
the
alleged
violator
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
decision
of
the
district
court
which
had
held
that
there
had
been
no
violation
warranting
injunctive
relief
was
not
res
adjudicata
on
the
treble
damage
count.
this
case
came
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
a
method
of
vacating
the
district
court
judgment.
the
government
should
have
done
it.
it
didn't
do
so.
now,
i
say
to
the
court
that
this
case
is
different.
the
united
states'
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
this
rather
peculiar
rule
21.
ordinarily,
we
know
that
where
you
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
--
it's
a
local
rule.
it
doesn't
tie
in
to
any
federal
rule
that
i
know
of
and
--
and
the
reason
for
it
is
that
if
i
may
speculate
for
a
moment,
it
results
primarily
from
the
tremendous
volume
of
--
of
personal
injury
cases
where
during
the
course
of
an
appeal
when
the
--
perhaps
the
transcript
is
in
one
of
the
briefs,
sir,
and
the
case
is
settled
and
rather
didn't
have
to
go
to
the
court
and
have
the
court
prepare
--
have
order
prepared.
the
court
by
rule
21
authorizes
the
clerk
to
--
it
says
dismiss.
i
think
really
what
it
is,
a
strike
from
the
calendar,
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
debate
that
with
you
--
with
the
court
or
with
the
government.
the
clerk
then
takes
and
sends
a
certified
transcript
of
this
stipulation
back
to
the
clerk
of
the
municipal
court.
this
of
course
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i'm
advised
that
the
clerk
of
the
district
court,
he
simply
doesn't
know
what
to
do
with
it.
he
just
enters
it
in
the
docket.
but
this
particular
stipulation
has
been
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
is
the
evidence.
i've
been
unable
to
find
any
cases
in
the
district
court
construing
this.
i
--
i
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
aware
of
the
munsingwear
case
and
it
has
been
as
i
observed.
i
can't
cite
you
the
specific
case.
it's
careful
on
cases
that
come
up
that
are
dismissed
from
a
--
mootness
in
the
case
of
death
or
things
of
that
sort,
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
with
specific
instructions
to
dismiss
finally
so
that
this
problem
of
mootness
does
not
come
up.
but
here,
i
think
there's
a
more
important
question
than
the
--
the
strict
question
of
res
adjudicata,
to
have
this
type
of
a
question
raised
at
this
late
stage
and
have
a
determination
made
on
a
matter
that
i
suggest
to
your
honors
a
cursory
reading
of
the
docket
at
the
court
of
claims
will
show
pay
case
after
pay
case
where
the
government
comes
in
and
says,
“we're
not
bound
by
that.”
and
it
may
not
surprise
your
honors
that
most
times
when
they
do
re-litigate
the
question
in
at
least
two
cases
in
the
levee
case
and
in
the
o'brien
case
when
the
government
re-litigated
the
question
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
favorable
decision
of
the
district
court
was
in
fact
reversed.
and
an
employee
who
came
to
the
court
of
claims
thinking
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
than
what
we
call
a
39
(c)
proceeding
to
determine
how
much
salary
was
coming
to
him
finds
himself
confronted
with
the
defense
that
his
discharge
was
proper
or
that
there
was
good
cause
for
it
and
he
losses
this
case.
that
is
precisely
what
happened
to
the
o'brien
case.
this
is
to
those
who
practice
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
leading
case
in
the
court
of
claims
on
this
subject
that
we
don't
have
res
adjudicata
when
we
bring
an
action
in
the
district
court
and
if
successful
and
then
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
sir.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
right.
there
was
a
--
a
failure
to
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
--
substitute.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
--
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
and
--
and
it
is
for
this
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
think
there
is.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
rule
21,
i
--
i
don't
have
the
precise
language.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
all
that
rule
21
provides
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
where
the
parties
have
agreed
to
withdraw
an
appeal
and
for
whatever
reason
it
may
be,
settlement,
death,
any
reason
at
all,
it
no
longer
has
to
go
to
the
court
for
an
order
or
a
rule,
as
it
is
used
to
be
called,
dismissing
the
appeal.
the
appeal
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
of
this
agreement,
a
copy
of
this
agreement
is
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
have
felt
the
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
right.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
it
--
it's
my
own
view
that
the
case
--
the
purpose
ascending
this
fact
was
of
the
district
courts
to
do
what
this
court
has
always
suggested
and
that
is,
where
a
case
has
become
moot,
dismiss
it,
so
it's
not
binding
on
the
party.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
that's
right.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
stands
today
as
an
order
of
dismissal
dismissing
all
complaints
on
the
merits.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
judge
whittaker?
i
would
like
and
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
solicitor
general
didn't
mean
to
mislead
the
court.
but
i
think
that
the
appendix
of
the
government's
file
should
very
definitely
be
misleading.
this
appendix
was
prepared
after
the
war
claims
commission
went
out
of
existence.
the
statutory
appendix
purports
--
sets
forth
the
war
claims
act
of
1948
--
sets
forth
the
war
claims
act
of
1948
as
it
existed
at
the
time
this
congressional
document
was
prepared
in
january
of
1956.
the
war
claims
act
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
removed
and
as
it
existed
as
it
was
at
the
time
it
went
out
of
business
by
virtue
of
the
legislative
reorganization
act
is
different.
it
is
not
different
from
substantially
in
substance,
but
it
is
a
different
act
and
i'm
sure
that
the
solicitor
would
join
with
me
in
suggesting
that
in
studying
the
war
claims
act
of
1948,
that
the
court
(inaudible)
said
at
the
very
public
law
and
not
the
act
as
it
appears
in
this
court.
the
public
law
citation
does
appear
in
our
brief.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
well
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
the
act
as
it
appears
in
--
in
the
appendix
mr.
justice
black
talks
about
the
fund
claims
settlement
commission.
it
has
no
reference
to
the
provisions
which
are
the
key
provisions
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
he
shall
be
appointed,
as
term
shall
expire
when
commission's
function
shall
expire.
i
haven't
in
the
few
weeks
that
we've
had
to
prepare
this
case
since
the
receipt
of
the
government's
brief.
i've
been
able
to
go
over
the
language
word
for
word,
but
i'm
quite
sure
that
as
i
say
that
the
act
should
be
read
in
its
context
and
in
its
form
as
it
was
when
the
commission
expired.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
in
--
in
my
original
brief,
the
citation.
it's
50
u.s.c.
appendix
--
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
just
in
the
few
moments
left
of
me
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
is
the
old
argument
that
we've
heard
ever
since
this
country
established
that
the
founding
fathers
might
have
set
up
a
much
more
efficient
way
of
running
this
government.
certainly,
the
impeachment
procedure
is
cumbersome.
certainly,
the
procedure
of
having
congress
enact
laws
and
giving
the
president
the
right
to
veto
them,
there
are
more
efficient
ways
to
adopt
laws.
there
are
more
efficient
ways
to
enforce
crime,
but
this
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
question
is
not
what
is
the
most
expeditious
way
to
remove
these
people,
but
what
is
the
best
way
of
keeping
the
three
great
departments
separate.
truly,
there
may
be
arguments
made
that
--
and
we
hear
them
from
time
to
time
in
recent
years
that
some
of
our
judges
should
be
removed
or
some
of
our
courts
should
be
eliminated
that
we
might
perhaps
run
our
government.
we
might
uncover
subversives
and
criminals
and
put
the
dope
addicts
in
jail
with
much
more
dispatch,
but
that
isn't
the
question.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
agency
performing
legislative
and
judicial
powers,
functions,
effectuating
them.
it
doesn't
handle
them
incidentally
the
way
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
might
if
congress
delegated
it
to
him.
if
the
secretary
of
treasury
were
to
exercise
one
of
these
functions,
this
would
be
incidental
to
its
other
functions,
but
it
isn't
the
secretary
that
makes
section
8
reports.
it
isn't
the
secretary
that
carries
out
congress'
function
to
pay
the
debts
and
to
create
rights
and
to
adjudicate
them.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i
may
make
public
confession
that
i
say
sometimes
that's
good
for
the
soul.
had
we
been
aware,
and
i
think
my
adversary,
mr.
hickey
(ph),
had
we
both
been
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
munsingwear
case,
this
stipulation
never
would
have
been
drawn
in
its
fashion
because
both
mr.
hickey
(ph)
and
myself
knew
that
this
case
was
going
to
the
court
of
claims.
what
we
wanted
to
do
is
to
get
this
case
out
of
the
court
of
claims
--
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
under
28
u.s.c.
1500,
you
can't
bring
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims
while
there's
another
action
pending
in
another
court.
we
knew
that
we
could
never
get
a
decision
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
if
we
didn't
get
rid
of
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
done
it
on
its
own
motion
and
we
would've
had
to
go
forward,
print
up
the
record,
print
briefs,
and
go
forward
with
the
whole
case.
so,
again,
i
say
this
is
not
part
of
the
record
and
--
but
that
was
the
intent
that
the
parties
go
right
back
to
where
they
were
at
the
beginning.
mr.
i.
h.
wachtel
i'm
sure
of
that
your
honor.[laughter]
