mr.
mathias
f.
correa
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
separate
questions
involved
in
this
appeal.
although
both
are
aspects
of
the
administration
by
federal
trial
courts
of
what
has
come
to
be
known
especially
in
the
antitrust
appeal
as
the
(inaudible)
case.
the
first
question
is
as
to
whether
the
government
is
entitled
by
the
simple
device
of
the
voluntary
dismissal
to
seek
review
of
an
interim
discovery
order,
which
in
no
way
affects
the
ability
of
the
government
to
continue
the
prosecution
of
its
case.
now,
the
second
question
is
the
merits
of
the
order
production
of
the
grand
jury
minutes.
since
there
are
three
of
us
arguing
on
our
side
as
a
plan
of
argument
subject
of
all
--
it
was
of
course
to
the
approval
and
the
wishes
of
the
court.
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
first
the
question,
general
royall
will
follow
to
address
himself
to
the
second,
and
mr.
fortas
will
sum
up
any
remaining
aspects
of
both
questions.
now,
if
the
court
please,
at
the
outset
they're
certain
of
the
facts
which
have
been
adverted
to
you
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant,
which
need
to
be
stated
a
bit
more
fully
perhaps.
as
has
been
stated
the
original
discovery
order
here
was
ended
in
july
24,
1956.
it
was
a
usual
form
of
rule
34
order
in
the
sense
that
it
directed
plaintiff
to
produce
the
grand
jury
transcripts
for
inspection
and
copy.
the
government,
although,
consenting
to
the
form
of
the
order
at
time
it
was
ended,
stated
that
it
--
then
there
that
it
did
not
propose
to
comply
with.
defendants
thereupon
stated
that
they
would
wait
the
30
days
provided
by
the
order
for
compliance
and
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
government
continue
to
adhere
to
its
position
that
it
would
not
comply,
they
would
take
such
action
under
the
rules
as
they
were
then
advised.
no
one,
the
court,
the
government,
or
the
defendants
suggested
at
that
moment,
that
is
on
july
24,
1956,
what
action
should
or
would
be
taken
in
the
event
of
ultimate
non-compliance.
now,
thereafter,
on
august
16,
1956
as
has
been
stated,
before
the
expiration
of
the
30
days,
plaintiff
brought
out
a
motion
asking
that
the
original
order
of
july
23rd,
directing
the
plaintiff
to
produce
be
set
aside
and
that
they
be
substituted
for
it.
an
amended
order
proposed
by
plaintiff,
which
would
provide
no
direction
upon
plaintiff
to
do
anything
but
simply
would
provide
that
the
action
would
be
dismissed
unless
plaintiff
had
produced
the
transcripts
by
august
24.
in
proposing
this
amended
order,
the
plaintiff
asked
in
the
alternative
but
we
think
it's
significant
only
as
a
second
choice.
that
is
in
--
the
plaintiff
said
in
the
event
that
the
court
does
not
see
fit
to
enter
plaintiff's
proposed
amended
order.
then
and
only
then,
plaintiff
asked
the
court
for
a
stay
of
its
original
order
of
july
23rd,
1956,
in
order
to
permit
the
filing
of
an
appeal
by
plaintiff
from
that
original
order
or
the
filing
of
an
application
for
an
extraordinary
writ
or
both.
now,
defendants
entered
no
objection
to
the
plaintiff's
motion
and
the
court
accordingly
granted
the
plaintiff's
first
choice
and
ended
the
proposed
amended
order
in
substitution
for
the
court's
original
order
of
july
23rd.
now,
if
the
court
please,
thereafter,
has
--
has
been
noted
the
court
below
wrote
to
all
the
counsel
for
the
parties,
including
government,
to
find
out
after
july
24th
whether
or
not
the
government
had
turned
over
the
transcript.
and,
the
court
said,
this
was
pursuant
to
the
government's
amended
order,
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
if
the
transcripts
have
not
been
introduced,
i
shall
dismiss
the
action
pursuant
to
the
amended
order
of
august
16.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
effect
of
these
procedural
maneuvers
of
plaintiff,
if
they
are
upheld
is
one,
to
deprive
this
court
of
the
opportunity
of
passing
upon
the
renewability
of
the
original
production
order,
whether
as
a
matter
of
appeal.
the
complainant
originally
said
they
might
appeal
that
or
as
a
matter
of
an
application
for
the
issuance
of
an
extraordinary
writ.
now,
additionally,
the
procedure
followed
by
a
plaintiff
would
have
the
effect,
if
again
is
validated
of
requiring
this
court
to
review
the
discovery
order
on
the
basis
that
if
the
order
is
sustained,
the
action
is
dismissed.
now,
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
the
plaintiff
was
under
no
compulsory
to
adopt
this
course.
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
below
would
have
entered
the
stay
proposed
by
a
plaintiff
as
its
second
choice
and
it
thus
enable
the
plaintiff
to
seek
review
in
this
court
of
the
original
discovery
order.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
yes,
sir.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
you
mean
if
the
court
had
entered
that
--
that
order
originally
on
its
own
motion?
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
believe
the
government
could
have.
as
it
could
have,
had
the
court
at
the
expiration
of
the
30
days
on
its
own
motion
dismissed
the
action
for
the
reason
--
by
reason
of
the
noncompliance.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
it's
the
--
it's
the
difference,
if
your
honor
please,
between
a
voluntary
and
an
involuntary
dismissal.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
out
of
court
whenever
they
move
the
dismissal.
if
they
have
procured
the
dismissal
of
the
action,
whatever
their
motive
in
doing
it,
i
mean,
there's
no
one
saying
their
motives,
their
motive
was
perfectly
obvious,
they
wanted
to
get
a
review
of
this
order.
but
the
fact
that
their
motive
maybe
sound
doesn't
affect
the
effect
of
what
they've
done
legally.
now,
in
this
case
that's
cited
in
the
briefs,
your
honor,
you
may
recall
babbitt
against
the
united
states
involving
a
controversy
about
the
pay
of
an
officer,
an
army
officer.
there
was
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
--
for
the
government,
the
law
i
think
was
in
the
court
of
claim.
but
the
government
consented
for
the
entry
of
judgment
since
they
were
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
reason
of
the
government's
motive
is
perfectly
sound,
they
--
they
said
in
substance
as
to
avoid
a
multiplicity
litigation,
which
we
know
started
to
take
place
on
account
of
this
--
because
of
this
ruling
but
this
court
held
that
the
order
was
not
renewable
because
it
had
been
entered
upon
the
consent
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
government
to
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
you
mean,
the
amended
order?
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
the
thomsen
case,
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
there
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
the
court
in
the
thomsen
case
reversed
a
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
and
ordered
a
new
trial.
the
plaintiff
stipulated
the
judgment
absolute
that
it
was
called
frequently
under
the
flat
in
many
states
and
provided
by
statute
in
many
states,
and
appealed
that
judgment,
produced
and
final,
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
it
was
there
contended
that
the
plaintiff,
by
so
stipulating
had
consented
to
the
judgment
against
him.
well,
actually,
the
plaintiff
hadn't,
the
judgment
was
against
him,
before
his
stipulation
and
after
his
stipulation.
he
had
relinquished
a
benefit
indeed,
which
was
contained
in
the
original
judgment
in
order
to
get
--
to
protect
his
appeal.
now
here,
before
this
plaintiff
stipulated,
you
say
or
moved,
there
was
no
judgment
against
him
after.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
but
there
was
no
judgment
of
dismissal,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that
--
that's
the
judgment
which
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
entitled
them
to
be
here
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
they
did
have
a
choice,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
their
choice
was
--
they're
own
second
choice
stated
in
their
papers
to
--
applied
to
the
district
court
for
a
stay
and
to
make
a
new
--
make
application
to
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
an
extraordinary
writ.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
i
--
i
would
say
this,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
they
did
but
let
me
say
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
i'm
honored.
let
me
say,
if
your
honor
please,
if
their
--
if
their
views
as
to
the
importance,
the
public
importance
of
this
decision
below
and
at
the
importance
of
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
being
presented.
if
those
views
are
sound,
then
they
had
an
extraordinary
good
case
for
the
issuance
of
the
extraordinary
writ,
if
your
honor
please.
and
that
would
--
they
would
be
entitled
to
expect
that
this
court
would
agree
with
them
and
would
issue
the
writ
to
protect
the
side,
this
most
important
question.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
except
in
the
--
in
the
appropriate
situation
in
the
argument
on
the
merits
precisely
is
a
part
of
this,
the
appropriate
situation.
and
may
i
point
out
further
a
distinction
of
the
thomsen
case.
that
as
i've
stated
in
the
thomsen
case,
what
the
plaintiff
did
by
consenting
to
the
amendment
of
the
order
which
was
there
made
is
to
give
up
the
plaintiff,
running
in
his
favor
in
that
order.
the
plaintiff
belonging
in
this
case
by
moving
for
the
entry
of
the
amended
order
secured
a
benefit.
now,
the
benefit
being,
that
he
was
relieved
of
the
direction
of
the
original
order
which
directed
plaintiff
to
produce.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that
is
correct.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
if
your
honor
please,
when
a
person
moves
for
a
dismissal,
that
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
--
that
is
an
involuntary
dismissal.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
was,
if
your
honor
please,
a
voluntary
dismissal
because
of
form,
which
plaintiff
didn't.
plaintiff
came
in
and
moved
the
court
to
enter
an
order
which
provided
that
the
action
would
be
dismissed
upon
the
happening
of
an
event
which
was
wholly
within
the
plaintiff's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
if
the
court
must
take
the
view,
i
take
it
that
it
is
a
voluntary
dismissal.
but
we
submit
it
is
and
the
fact
that
a
situation
had
arisen
in
the
litigation,
which
the
government
didn't
like
or
the
plaintiff
didn't
like
doesn't
furnish
any
sufficient
reason
for
converting
a
voluntary
dismissal
into
an
involuntary
one.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
because
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
correct.
of
course
but,
your
honor,
knows
in
many
states
or
some
states
at
least,
i
guess
its
less
common
than
it
used
to
be,
a
plaintiff
could
place
a
voluntary
nonsuit.
if
at
a
particular
stage
of
the
case,
it
appeared
that
something
had
happened
which
was
obstructive
of
his
--
his
case,
unless
he
took
a
voluntary
nonsuit
and
then
start
over.
but
even
in
those
stages,
to
tell
that
the
plaintiff
cannot
appeal
such
a
nonsuit.
now,
we
submit
that
here,
if
this
procedure
is
validated,
any
plaintiff
in
effect,
who
finds
himself
at
some
stage
in
a
litigation
placing
an
interlocutory
and
non-appealable
order
that
he
doesn't
like,
can
simply
come
in
and
dismiss
his
action
and
then
appeal
the
dismissal.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
can
only
answer
in
the
terms
of
the
old
legal
maxim
that
one
is
presumed
to
intend
that
natural
consequences
of
one's
act.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
if
the
court
please.
first,
this
is
true
with
every
discovery
order,
i
take
it
essentially
because
if
the
party
obeys,
the
material
is
discovered
and
to
the
extent
that
the
mere
discovery
of
the
material
is
in
issue,
that's
been
done.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that's
right,
if
your
honor
please.
and
secondly,
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
had
they
obeyed
the
order
and
then
made
it
--
preserved
appropriate
objection
throughout
the
trial
that
any
use
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
that
were
tended
were
discovered
under
the
order,
they
might
still
be
able
to
raise
the
question
on
the
appeal
from
an
ultimate
judgment.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
no.
they
would
have
had
disclosure
obviously
of
these
records.
the
only
question
that
might
conceivably
be
deserved
is
whether
the
ruling
was
right
or
wrong
which
would
affect
the
institution
because,
your
honor,
would
bear
in
mind
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
that's
right.
and
--
and
that
would
--
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
it
wouldn't
take
care
of
it
in
respect
of
this
one
(inaudible)
grand
jury
that
sat
five
years
ago
but
it
would
take
care
of
it
with
respect
of
all
future
grand
juries.
and
if
your
honor
please,
the
government
here
is
not
contending,
that
if
as
a
party
is
prejudiced
in
any
way
in
the
conduct
of
its
case
by
this
order,
the
government
rather
comes
in
and
says,
“we
are
appealing
this
because
we're
protecting
the
institution
of
the
grand
jury.”
now,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
serious
question,
which
arises
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government,
qua
a
plaintiff
in
this
action
is
entitled
to
seek
a
review
of
an
order
on
--
of
this
--
of
an
order
of
this
kind
on
that
basis.
because
these
papers
while
they're
in
the
physical
possession
of
the
department
of
justice,
are
not
a
party's
papers.
they
are
the
--
they
are
the
record
of
the
grand
jury
inquiry
--
the
grand
jury
inquiry,
the
judicial
inquiry
by
an
arm
of
the
court
and
they
are
the
court's
papers
as
rule
6
(e)
recognizes,
and
rule
6
(e)
in
that
respect
is
no
more
than
declaratory
of
what
we
understand
the
law
to
be
in
any
event.
so
that
while
--
it
is
true
and
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
various
united
states
attorney
have
an
interest.
and
i
think
very
probably
a
right
to
be
heard
on
a
proposed
action
of
the
court
in
disclosing
or
releasing
grand
jury
minutes.
that
is
in
that
capacity
as
law
enforcement
officers
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
well,
they
are
custodians
of
the
court.
mr.
mathias
f.
correa
the
--
the
order
does
but
the
point
is
that
the
physical
thing,
a
part
of
the
records
of
the
court
by
administrative
circumstance
that
they
offer
reasons
of
convenience
or
whatever,
kept
in
the
physical
custody
of
these
--
these
officers.
but
my
--
my
point
here,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
these
officers
as
law
enforcement
officers
have
a
right
to
be
heard.
they
would
have
a
right
to
apply
to
this
court
for
review
or
to
the
appropriate
court
of
appeal
for
review
of
what
they
considered
an
egregious
proposed
abused
of
discretion.
but,
that
reason
does
not
give
them
standing
in
their
capacity
as
parties
to
this
particular
civil
action
appealing
a
judgment
in
this
particular
civil
action
which
they
do
not
in
claim
prejudices
them
than
in
the
action
in
any
way
to
obtain
here
review
of
this
order.
