mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
very
briefly,
to
a
summary
of
the
jurisdictional
or
administrative
position
of
this
case
as
i
see
it.
then,
i
should
like
to
come
back
for
a
moment
to
a
question,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
with
respect
to
our
position,
as
to
the
scope
of
the
decision
which
we
are
requesting
of
the
court
here.
now,
this
dismissal
order
that
was
entered
by
the
court
below
on
the
motion
of
the
government
was
a
voluntary
order.
it
was
voluntary,
not
merely
in
the
technical
sense
that
the
government
made
the
motion
that
induced
the
dismissal
order.
it
was
a
voluntary
order
in
a
real
sense.
there
was
no
reason
whatever,
why
the
government
had
to
see
dismissal
of
this
case.
dismissal
was
not
a
necessary
or
an
inevitable
consequence
of
the
production
order,
number
one.
number
two,
dismissal
was
not
the
only
way
that
the
government
could
get
a
review
of
the
very
substantial
and
important
question
that
was
presented,
by
the
underlying
production
order.
mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
if
you'll
give
me
just
a
moment.
i
want
to
explain
quite
specifically,
the
sense
in
which
i'm
using
the
word
"voluntary".
first,
as
a
matter
of
background,
the
government
as
a
general
lawyer
has
explained.
the
government
had
no
time,
although
invited
by
the
court
on
several
occasions,
submitted
any
suggestions
or
counter
suggestions
as
to
the
scope
of
the
order.
they
had
no
time
offered
to
supply
some
recent
testimony
of
the
witnesses.
they
have
no
time
suggested
that
they
give
the
defendants
some
of
the
testimony
and
not
all
of
the
testimony.
there
was
no
suggestion
as
the
record
shows
at
213,
at
any
time,
that
any
of
this
testimony
was
not
relevant.
now,
that's
the
background.
the
immediate
point
with
respect
to
the
voluntary
character
of
the
government's
action
here
is
this.
under
rule
37,
the
trial
court
has
available
to
it
a
number
of
sanctions
and
remedies
in
the
event
of
refusal
to
comply
with
a
production
order.
i
respectfully
say
to
you,
that
upon
a
reading
of
judge
modarelli's
opinions
in
this
case,
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
expect
that
if
the
government
had
allowed
this
matter
to
take
its
natural
course
without
precipitating
this
test
case,
if
they
had
allowed
this
matter
to
take
its
natural
course,
judge
modarelli
might
very
well
have
made
the
order
provided
for
by
rule
37.
for
example,
to
impound
the
grand
jury
transcript
--
transcripts
to
forbid
the
government
from
any
further
use
of
that
grand
jury
transcript
but
the
government
didn't
wait
for
that.
they
had
a
lot
of
trouble
on
this
issue
in
a
great
many
courts
throughout
the
country
and
they
wanted
to
precipitate,
this
is
my
surmise,
a
test
of
this
question
quite
understandably.
and
so,
they
adopted
the
course
of
moving
for
a
dismissal
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
a
refusal
to
produce.
mr.
abe
fortas
well
in
my
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abe
fortas
in
my
opinion
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
i'm
not
saying
they
assented
to
the
order
of
production.
what
i
am
saying,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
use
language
that
i
believe
appears
in
your
opinion
in
calloway
is
that
the
government
cannot
by
this
device,
so
by
voluntary
dismissal,
asked
this
court
to
review
a
question
which
incidentally,
passed
the
path
of
a
litigation
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
now,
they
had
an
alternative,
the
obvious
alternative
was
to
do
what
they
did
in
bowman
dairy
and
which
mr.
justice
burton
wrote
the
opinion.
it
is
--
that
they
say
it
would
have
been
unseemly
for
the
attorney
general
to
subject
himself
to
a
contempt
order.
on
the
first
place,
the
attorney
general
doesn't
do
it,
he
gets
one
of
his
boys
to
do
it
just
as
he
did
in
bowman
dairy.
a
contempt
order
could
have
been
entered
here
against
the
government.
an
appeal
could
have
been
had
from
that
contempt
order.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
practical
consequences
of
that
distinction
are
important,
it
is
not
merely
a
technicality.
if
the
government
had
pursued
the
contempt
route,
the
litigation
could
have
proceeded.
meaning,
that
this
is
been
a
year
and
a
half
since
he
entered
that
order
to
this
day.
meanwhile,
the
trial
judge,
i'm
sorry
to
say
has
died,
witnesses
have
disappeared,
documents
have
been
dispersed
and
memories
including
the
memory
of
counsel
as
to
what
the
merits
of
this
case
is
about
have
become
vaguer.
and
the
government
had
the
alternative
in
the
first
place
they
had
alternatives
other
than
the
order
of
dismissal,
such
as
are
the
impounding
of
the
documents.
and
in
the
second
place,
they
had
all
alternatives
to
get
the
question
before
this
court,
the
obvious
one
being
contempt,
apart
from
the
extraordinary
writ.
and
i
say
that
to
my
mind,
this
is
a
clear
case
of
the
government
endeavoring
to
get
a
test
before
this
court
without
any
warrant
in
law.
now,
very
briefly,
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
this
underlying
order
is
justified
in
my
opinion
and
here
i
may
have
a
little
difference
with
my
brother,
general
lawyer.
it
is
justified
in
this
case
because
of
the
administrative
considerations
in
a
big
case.
your
honors
will
recall
that
the
government
does
not
claim
secrecy.
they
say
we
can
use
the
grand
jury
transcript
to
prepare
the
complaint.
we
can
use
it
to
impeach
the
witnesses.
they
used
it
90
times
in
the
socony-vacuum
case.
they
say
that
at
the
trial
we'll
be
able
to
get
it
and
more
than
that,
they
say
we
can
get
all
this
material
by
depositions
but
what
do
they
say
we
cannot
do
and
that
the
trial
judge
cannot
do.
they
say
that
the
trial
judge
after
five
weary
years
of
litigation
and
the
government
hadn't
completed
its
discovery
--
we
have
not
begun
ours.
the
prospect
of
another
decade
of
litigation
and
they
say
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
to
enter
an
order,
an
administrative
order
if
you
please,
allowing
us
access
to
this
transcript.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
there
were
parts
of
this
transcript
that
we
should
not
have
seen
and
i
can
readily
understand
that
there
might
be
in
some
grand
jury
investigations.
i
submit
to
you
that
all
the
government
had
to
do
was
to
go
to
judge
modarelli
and
say,
"judge
modarelli
please
examine
the
transcript
from
pages
1000
to
2000
and
see
if
you
don't
agree
with
us
that
the
defendant
shouldn't
get
that,"
but
that
isn't
what
they're
interested
in.
they
were
interested
in
a
test
of
the
basic
question.
i'm
not
criticizing
the
very
able
and
dedicated
lawyers
who
tried
this
case.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
my
--
i
do
not
believe
that
in
any
case
where
a
civil
case
has
been
preceded
by
a
grand
jury
investigation,
the
defendants
were
automatically
entitled
to
the
transcript,
by
no
means.
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing.
first,
that
the
government
has
used,
is
using
and
proposes
to
use
the
transcript
and
second,
and
of
basic
importance,
there
has
to
be
a
real
and
substantial
showing,
that
the
transcript
--
that
the
furnishing
of
the
transcript
for
an
investigation
for
examination
by
the
defendants
will
serve
a
very
--
very
important
purpose
as
it
would
here.
here
there's
no
question
about
it.
it
would
have
served
it
would
have
saved
at
least
a
year
probably,
two
years.
27
living
witnesses
one
of
them
had
died.
just
imagine
all
these
lawyers
here
taking
the
depositions
of
each
one
of
those
witnesses
scattered
all
over
the
country
and
how
long
that
would
take
and
that
is
the
course
that
the
government
here
requires
and
--
and
it
was
to
avoid
that,
in
the
setting
of
this
gargantuan
case
as
it
truly
is
and
was
that
judge
modarelli
exercised
his
discretionary
power
and
said,
"you
may
have
the
transcript,"
even
though
he
invited
the
government
over
and
over
again
to
submit
limitations.
i
--
and
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
if
they
had
--
that
if
they
--
this
case
had
taken
its
normal
course
as
contemplated
by
law,
and
that
the
government
could
have
obtained
a
narrowing
down
of
this
order.
that's
the
way
law
suits
are.
and
finally,
we
know
if
the
court
please,
there
are
many
cases
that
come
up,
many
interlocutory
and
preliminary
orders
had
come
up
in
the
course
of
litigation
which
seem
tremendously
important
and
the
rules
of
this
court,
the
appellant
rules,
are
based
upon
a
very
sensible
proposition
--
are
based
upon
the
very
sensible
proposition
that
a
great
many
of
those
offenses
get
washed
out
in
a
force
of
litigation,
they
don't
prove
to
be
mortal
injuries.
and
the
case
goes
on
and
its
tried,
one
side
wins,
one
side
loses
and
1001
questions
that
might
have
been
appealed
are
washed
out
in
that
process.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case.
mr.
abe
fortas
your
honor
will
recall
that
records
have
been
previously
pointed
out,
that
the
government
refused
to
answer
that
specifically.
mr.
abe
fortas
but
in
a
subsequent
argument,
the
very
able
mr.
mcdowell,
the
counsel
for
the
government
did
say
that
we
have
used
and
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
we
hold
--
mr.
abe
fortas
there
is
nothing
in
this
record.
there
is
in
the
socony-vacuum
case
and
decided
by
this
court
a
precedent,
where
the
government
used
it
90
times
as
opinion
in
that
case
recites.
but
there
was
no
specification,
although
judge
modarelli
attempted
to
obtain
them
and
the
government
refused
to
specify
just
exactly
what
they
intended
to
do.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
thank
you.
