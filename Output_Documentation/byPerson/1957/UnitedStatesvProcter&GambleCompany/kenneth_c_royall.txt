mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
correa
has
well
represented
the
aspect
of
the
case
relating
to
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal.
my
presentation
will
be
directed
to
the
question
of
whether
the
production
order
was
a
problem.
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleges
antitrust
violations
extending
since
1926
and
it
covers
practically
every
aspect
of
the
business
of
these
defendants
without
residing
them,
of
their
selling,
their
promotion,
their
patents,
their
surveys,
their
meetings,
their
conferences,
their
embroiders,
very
elaborate
territory.
and
that
includes
and
is
intended
to
include
a
large
number
of
oral
conversations
that
was
developed
in
the
record.
in
this
--
pursuant
to
this
complaint,
the
plaintiffs
subpoenaed
scrolls
of
thousands
of
papers
embracing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
sheets
of
papers.
and
their
preparation
which
the
trial
judge
commented
on
not
too
favorably
during
the
trial
extended
over
a
period
of
five
years
before
this
order
of
production
was
entered.
the
plaintiff
admittedly
used
the
grand
jury
transcripts
first
in
bringing
the
action
and
framing
the
allegations
of
the
complainant
so
stated.
it
used
then
in
the
preparation
of
the
case
and
stated
that
they
intended
to
use
them
during
the
remainder
of
the
case.
in
a
public
announcement,
the
department
of
justice
said
the
filing
of
this
complaint
results
from
a
careful
and
thorough
investigation
of
the
industry
including
extensive
grand
jury
proceedings.
during
the
pendency
of
the
case
itself,
mr.
--
judge
barnes
speaking
before
a
house
judiciary
committee
says,
it
seems
clear
that
the
sole
means
for
compelling
pre-complete
data
in
civil
cases,
speaking
of
civil
antitrust
cases
in
the
grand
jury.
now,
from
1951
on
this
investigation
and
the
lawsuit
in
the
further
preparation
continued.
and
as
far
back
as
1954,
the
trial
judge
said,
“one
of
my
concerns
is
since
the
plaintiff
has
been
preparing
this
case
for
probably
three
years.”
that
was
two
years
before
this
order
of
production.
how
much
longer
must
we
wait
for
the
defendant
to
prepare?
the
sooner
the
defendant
are
informed
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
--
of
the
plaintiff's
actual
contention
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
--
reached
the
point
i
think
which
i
described
the
complexity,
scope
of
the
case,
many
factors
that
arose
and
shown
that
the
bringing
of
this
case
and
the
preparation
of
it
was
founded
primarily
upon
the
grand
jury
proceedings
including
the
grand
jury
transcript.
it
was
in
the
light
of
that
background
that
the
court
ordered
the
production
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
before
doing
so
however,
the
court
sought
to
find
more
specific
facts
of
--
as
to
the
use
of
these
proceedings.
those
facts
of
course,
being
only
known
in
great
part
by
the
government,
and
he
asked
the
--
“mr.
mcdowell,
do
you
object
to
submitting
a
detailed
affidavit”
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
this
is
on
page
139
of
the
record.
“stating
what
use,
if
any,
the
plaintiff
has
made
in
the
past
to
the
grand
jury
transcript
while
preparing
for
the
trial
of
this
case,
what
use,
if
any,
the
plaintiff
intends
to
make
of
the
transcript
during
its
future
preparation
and
what
use
the
plaintiff
intends
to
make
of
the
transcript
during
the
trial?”
the
answer
to
that
question,
which
appears
on
page
197,
was
slightly
less
than
revealing.
the
answer
was
this,
"i
am
afraid
that
i
would
be
of
little
value
because
i
had
no
connection
with
this
case
until
last
year,
and
will
be
unable
to
address
myself
to
anything
in
that
connection.”
that
was
followed
by
a
letter,
“well,
mr.
mcdowell,”
saying
the
question
--
this
is
on
360,
"the
question
which
you
put
to
me
at
the
hearing
on
december
the
12
relating
to
the
use
by
the
government
of
the
transcripts
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
have
been
given
serious
consideration
within
the
department
of
justice.
i
am
instructed
respectfully
to
inform
you
that
we
do
not
wish
to
add
to
the
statement
which
i
made
at
the
hearing,"
which
statement
was
that
mr.
mcdowell
knew
nothing
about
it.
now
the
--
that
was
the
situation
when
this
came
on
to
be
considered.
then
the
court
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
sir,
i
would
be
glad
to
come
back
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
all
right,
sir.
now,
the
--
the
court
specifically
adverted
in
his
order
to
the
serious,
complex
and
unique
procedural
of
problems
involved
in
this
case.
and
on
the
question
of
relevance,
we
call
attention
to
this
fact.
when
the
government
sought
the
grand
jury
documents
and
that
was
contested
by
the
defendants,
the
only
statement
they
made
was
that
they
are
relevant
or
material
to
the
issues
of
this
case
and
are
needed
to
the
aid
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
preparation
of
it,
and
that's
the
limit
of
their
statement.
the
grand
jury
transcripts
were
intertwined
or
became
later
and
were
part
of
the
same
investigation.
and
this
--
these
later
queries
got
no
additional
information.
these
documents
and
the
transcript
were
jointly
used,
and
i
want
to
add
this
statement
of
the
counsel,
well,
of
the
court
and
then
of
the
counsel.
the
--
the
court
says
the
plaintiff
has
never
contended
the
transcript
is
irrelevant
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
indeed,
such
a
contention
would
be
disingenuous
in
view
of
the
fact
of
the
plaintiff's
use
of
the
transcripts.
now,
that's
on
the
background,
they
wouldn't
tell
him
what
the
use
was.
the
plaintiff
does
not
deny
that
it
intends
to
use
this
evidence
in
the
--
in
the
future,
if
the
occasion
should
arise
and
they
were
to
place
no
limits
on
its
use.
and
they
are
the
ones
who
knew.
the
plaintiff's
counsel
said,
"i
did
not
understand
that
there
was
any
question
whether
the
government
had
the
use
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
that's
on
page
274.
upon
this
record,
the
court
has
properly
found
that
the
plaintiff
has
used
and
will
continue
to
use
the
transcript
while
preparing
for
the
trial
and
he's
also
found
that
the
defendants
will
be
aided
hereby
with
such
production.
he
added
this
little
more
specifically.
“i
would
not
grant
these
motions,
if
i
thought
they
were
useless
or
necessary
or
the
defendants
possessed
--
already
possessed
all
the
necessary
information
or
could
obtain
it
by
any
different
remedy.”
and
finally,
he
concluded
that
clearly,
the
ends
of
justice
will
be
attained
by
plaintiff's
disclosure
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
--
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
the
defendants
have
shown
good
cause
for
the
production.
now,
further
in
that
connection,
the
--
the
court
before
this
judgment
was
--
this
order
of
production
was
signed,
sought
to
get
from
the
government
any
suggestions
they
might
have
as
to
the
limitation,
restriction,
narrowing
of
the
order
of
production
but
with
no
success.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
that
appears
on
transcript
309-10
and
on
314.
i
think
those
are
the
two
pages.
he
invited
them
to
submit
a
form
of
order
and
he
said
this,
"because
it
might
be
interesting
to
see
what
kind
of
order
you
would
submit,
you
apparently
don't
like
the
one
the
defendants
have
submitted
because
you
think
it's
too
sweeping.
now,
let's
see
what
you
would
submit.”
the
reply
was,
“we
felt
it
unnecessary
to
cross
that
bridge
before
we
came
to
it.
well
the
bridge
was
right
in
front
of
it."
and
then
he
said,
"again,
let's
see
what
kind
--
what
kind
of
order
the
government
is
going
to
submit.”
the
government
did
not
offer
an
order,
did
not
suggest
a
change
in
the
form
of
order,
but
on
the
contrary,
consented
to
the
form
of
the
production
order.
that
appears
on
pages
--
page
262
to
263.
now,
the
decision
of
the
court
in
ordering
this
production
was
not
a
general
and
sweeping
decision
applicable
to
all
types
of
cases,
it
was
made
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
among
other
things
he
said
this,
"i
don't
want
to
make
a
burdensome
big
case
more
bothersome
for
anybody.
it
is
bad
enough
as
its
best.
when
i
wrote
this
opinion,
i
had
one
type
of
litigation
in
mind.
i
was
only
judging
the
facts
of
this
case."
you'll
find
that
on
307-10
and
303.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
this
i
think,
was
said
on
the
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
--
motion
to
rehear
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
--
perhaps.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i'll
have
to
read
that
if
this
already
were
here.
now,
i
will
--
i
think
the
question
before
this
court
on
the
part
of
production,
is
--
to
me
seems
a
simple
one
and
that
is
whether
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
he
can
determine
what
information
is
relevant,
needed
and
appropriate
for
the
defendants'
preparation
of
a
case.
the
burden
of
showing
an
abuse
of
trust
--
of
discretion
is
on
the
government.
i'll
give
you
the
background,
his
efforts
to
get
information
which
he
could
not
get
and
having
before
him
only
the
fact
of
the
statement,
admitted
statement
that
they
used
as
transcript,
to
draw
the
complaint
and
to
prepare
for
the
case
and
they
failed
to
give
him
any
more
definite
information.
it's
been
suggested
that
some
of
these
witnesses
were
witnesses
of
the
defendants.
the
defendants
particularly
in
this
type
of
case
wouldn't
have
much
allowed
talking
to
competitors
who
had
charged
these
other
defendants.
the
other
witnesses
they
don't
know
about.
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
get
a
sufficient
knowledge
to
equal
the
knowledge
which
the
government
had
and
stated
it
had
and
use
this
as
the
basis
for
the
entire
action.
the
--
another
feature
of
this
case
is
this.
if
with
--
if
with
a
judge
who's
been
from
the
case
since
it
started
and
with
the
knowledge
and
full
statement
he
made
of
his
efforts
to
get
particular
information,
if
his
to
be
overruled
then
the
effect
is
merely,
to
transfer
the
burden
of
administration
of
these
big
cases
to
a
higher
court.
he
must
be
left
with
that
and
your
remember
judge
friedman's
report,
which
ties
in
with
just
the
thought
i'm
giving
you.
now,
the
other
question
i
want
to
make
is
the
question
of
mutuality.
we
--
the
defendants
--
the
--
the
plaintiff
has
all
the
information
he
needs
from
this
transcripts.
i
will
bring
the
suit
of
an
interrogatories,
depositions
in
the
case
and
to
determine
the
witnesses,
the
type
of
examination
with
or
without
that
information.
and
the
court
said,
the
court
concludes
this
is
the
plaintiff
has
used
in
the
transcript
containing
relevant
information,
the
ends
of
justice
require
the
court
to
order
the
plaintiff
to
produce
and
permit
the
inspection
and
copying
of
the
transcripts,
equal
use
of
transcripts
by
defendants,
will
give
them
the
same
knowledge
and
so
forth
that
the
government
has.
the
--
it
reminds
me
which
--
of
a
citation
which
i
know
has
been
said
many
times
to
this
court,
this
question
of
mutuality,
when
the
government
becomes
a
moving
party
and
levels
the
great
powers
against
the
citizens.
it
should
be
held
with
the
same
standards
of
fair
dealing,
as
we
prescribe
for
other
legal
contest,
to
let
the
court
--
let
the
government
adopt
such
lesser
ones,
as
suits
the
convenience
of
his
officers,
is
to
start
down
the
totalitarian
path
and
that's
the
opinion
of
one
of
your
members.
the
--
the
government
is
seeking
to
convert
the
grand
jury
proceedings,
not
into
the
shield,
it
was
proposed
to
be,
but
into
a
sword
to
use
against
defendants
in
civil
actions.
that's
what
they
are
--
that's
--
that's
the
result
of
at
their
action,
all
that
contentions
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
if
i
had
to
answer
that
question,
i
might
say
yes,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
we
do
not
have
to
rest
on
that
board
of
principle
but,
of
course,
here
we
had
a
situation
that
the
government
used
it
principally,
for
bringing
their
case,
preparing
their
case
and
intended
to
use
it.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well
i
say
--
i
would
say
clearly
on
this
case,
they're
entitled
to
them
on
the
board
principle,
perhaps.
but
certainly,
when
you
add
to
that,
first
the
use
that
the
government
has
made
of
use
of
them
and
the
boldness
in
which
they
stated,
and
the
breadth
on
which
they
stated
and
add
to
that
the
unsuccessful
efforts
to
the
court,
to
get
any
particularization
out
them
or
to
suggest
any
other
means
of
solution.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no.--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
we
must
have
the
reason
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
i
think
the
reason
i've
stated
before
but
the
reasons
are
these.
that
the
government
uses
to
prepare
the
complaint.
they
used
it
in
their
discovery
efforts.
they
used
it
in
whatever
questions
they
asked
by
deposition
or
any
other
way.
they
are
--
say
they
will
use
it
in
any
other
way
that
comes
along,
perhaps,
in
--
during
the
trial,
they
would
had
to
get
specific
permission
of
the
court.
but
that's
not
questioned
here.
the
question
is
the
proprietary
use
of
it.
they
made
a
broad
use.
they
have
not
enlightened
the
court
and
they
are
the
only
ones
that
could
enlighten
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no,
sir
because
that
comes
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
that
comes
in
the
--
in
the
professional
privilege
but
this
case
doesn't
involve
that.
this
is
a
record
of
the
court
and
not
a
private
document
of
the
department
of
justice
which
they
got
in
the
manner
that
you
described
in
your
illustration.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
of
course
you've
got
--
you
got
cases
on
that
and
i
think
that
that
would
come
probably
within
the
professional
privilege,
perhaps.
but
this
--
this
would
not
fall
within
that
category
at
all.
now,
the
last
thing
i
want
to
say
is
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
they
had
--
they
a
right
to
use
it
for.
there's
no
question
about
that.
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i
don't
--
i
--
the
privilege
would
not
be
sufficient,
but
the
exercise
of
the
privilege
in
the
preparation
for
a
civil
case
and
that
being
the
only
evidence
we
got
of
it.
and
they
refusing
to
answer
other
question
as
to
the
use,
it's
the
only
thing
we
can
rely
otherwise
we'll
be
barred
completely
in
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
if
the
court
would
ask
me
my
opinion,
i
would
answer
it
one
way
but
i
don't
think
it's
proper
for
me
to
do
so
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
--
but
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
i
will
say
if
that
were
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
believe
in
a
court
reading
this
record
would
assume
that
was
the
sole
purpose.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
there
no
--
we
are
not
dependent
on
that.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
sir,
i
--
i
think
these
questions
are
in
reversing
are
much
more
restrictive
in
a
limited
situation
than
is
presented
in
this
case
and
while
i'm
interested
in
the
discussion
of
those,
i
think
i
must
confine
it
to
the
--
in
touching
the
ends
of
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly,
beyond
any
question,
we
are
entitled
of
those
to
get
a
fair
treatment.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
sir,
that
might
raise
a
question.
i
--
i'm
not
one
to
pass
on
the
f.b.i.
[laugh]
case
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes.
well
--
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
privilege
is
a
point.
the
privilege
is
a
point
in
the
question
as
i
understood
it
to
be
asked.
the
--
but
this
is
a
judicial
process
which
is
different
from
any
administrative
process
and
there
are
distinctions
between
the
two.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
what
is
that,
sir?
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
yes,
sir.
i'm
very
--
i'm
very
familiar
and
that
--
that
is
not
a
case
of
--
affects
this
case
at
all
because
that
is
the
question
of
not
of
a
public
document,
judicial
document.
mr.
kenneth
c.
royall
well,
sir,
we
--
i
--
i'm
not
passing
on
the
f.b.i.
reports.
i
say
they
are
not
involved
in
this
case
and
they
have
a
distinction.
that
is
a
--
an
executive
action.
this
is
a
--
a
judicial
process
in
the
courts.
now,
may
i
say
two
things
and
without
any
argument.
the
first
is,
i
think,
it's
perfectly
apparent
that
the
taking
of
depositions
could
not
supply
particularly,
with
the
lapse
of
memory
and
the
length
of
time
involved
could
not
supply
what
the
sworn
grand
jury
testimony
could.
and
the
second
thing
i
want
to
say,
is
that
the
--
the
type
of
case,
which
is
somewhat
repetitive,
the
type
of
case
involved
here
does
not
really
raise
a
question
of
--
of
violating
secrecy.
there
is
no
absolute
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceeding.
i
could
list
you
and
i
listed
in
my
brief
on
there
many
ways
in
which
they
are
known
and
the
courts
have
decided,
and
we
cite
their
authorities,
that
after
the
grand
jury
has
been
discharged,
that
these
--
this
secrecy
need
not
necessarily
prevail.
and
also,
i
point
out
there,
the
various
methods
in
which
with
all
propriety
under
the
law
that
they,
the
grand
jury
proceedings
can
be
known
to
the
public
and
that's
all
i
care
for
to
say,
at
least.
