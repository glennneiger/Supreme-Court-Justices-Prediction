justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bicks,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
issues
in
the
civil
proceeding
were
framed
by
the
use
of
the
government
of
the
information
obtained
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
you
yet
suggested
why
that
use
is
not
itself
an
intrusion
upon
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
also
another
way
of
saying
that
until
such
time
as
the
government
itself
may
use
one
of
the
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
at
the
trial,
there
cannot
arise
a
question
whether
the
government
has
intruded
upon
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
it
cannot
arise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is,
when
it
is
short
of
the
actual
calling
of
the
stand
by
the
government
or
by
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury
in
support
of
the
government's
civil
case.
when
is
it
that
the
government
admits
if
it
does
at
all,
that
there
is
an
intrusion
by
the
government
into
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
what
you've
been
saying
that
--
and
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
question
can't
possibly
arise
unless
you're
going
to
use
one
of
the
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury.
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
i'm
not
thinking
of
the
situation
at
which
the
court
requires
a
government
to
do
something
in
respect
to
the
grand
jury
minutes.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
the
government
concedes
that
there
can
be
on
its
part
in
the
intrusion,
into
the
secrecy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
answer
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
you're
giving?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
said
does
not
necessarily,
i
thought
perhaps
you
went
further
than
that
and
said
that
there
aren't
any
circumstances
in
light
of
the
rule
under
which
the
government's
acquiring
from
the
way
it
did,
the
information
later
used
in
support
of
the
civil
case
could
amount
to
an
intrusion
upon
secrecy,
are
you
saying
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
at
what
stage
in
the
civil
suit
was
this
motion
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
discovery
by
deposition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
long
after
his
testimony
before
the
grand
jury,
was
it
sought
to
take
the
testimony
of
this
proctor
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
--
not
quite
clear,
i
think
you
suggested
that
--
to
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
could
go
back
for
the
balancing
that
you
suggest
should
be
made.
can
that
be
made
at
this
juncture
or
would
that
have
to
be
done
almost
piecemeal
as
particular
circumstances
arose
in
taking
a
deposition
in
direct
trial
or
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bicks,
may
i
ask
this
one
last
question.
as
i
get
it
now
the
government's
claim
of
privilege
to
make
use
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
to
the
extent
it
has,
rests
solely
on
rule
6
(e),
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that
is
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
giving
the
construction
to
it
that
is
to
the
language
made
--
let's
see,
whether
is
it
that
the
matter
is
occurring
maybe
disclosed
to
the
attorney's
for
the
government
for
use
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
that
embraces
use
for
the
purpose
of
a
civil
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
this
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
correa,
didn't
you
start
this
discussion
by
saying
really
the
problem
is,
was
this
a
voluntary
or
an
involuntary
dismissal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
did
the
government
do
more
than
say
this,
if
you're
going
to
insist
on
our
compliance
with
that
order,
we
will
submit
to
an
involuntary
dismissal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
rightly
or
wrongly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
--
didn't
the
government
--
wasn't
what
the
government
trying
to
say
--
suggest
with,
they
get
out
of
this
thing
as
best
they
could,
if
the
court
was
going
to
insist
upon
their
compliance
to
the
turnover
order
by
submitting
to
an
involuntary
dismissal.
now,
they
made
the
--
that
might
add
up
to
a
voluntary
dismissal
but
is
it
any
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
have
to
attach
the
consequence,
voluntary
dismissal,
whether
or
not
the
government
intended
it
to
be
a
voluntary
dismissal,
don't
you
have
prevailed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
congress
do,
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
may
be
--
you
may
be
right
but
perhaps
we
ought
to
say
that
whatever
is
intended
this
has
to
add
up
to
a
voluntary
dismissal,
but
certainly
i
think
you
couldn't
suggest
on
this
record
if
the
government
intended
to
dismiss
the
facts
voluntarily.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
without
regard
to
whether
he
actually
intended
them
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
royall,
do
you
concede
that
what
the
government
used
it
for
--
the
government
was
privileged
to
use
it
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that
--
that
being
so,
then
don't
you
have
to
show
a
special
justification
aside
from
their
exercise
of
the
privilege?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
