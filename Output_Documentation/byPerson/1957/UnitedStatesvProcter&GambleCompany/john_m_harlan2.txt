harlan
did
they
both
--
did
they
both
honor
an
indictment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
for
my
question
is,
is
this
a
case
where
the
government
is
using
the
grand
jury
simply
as
an
aid
to
a
civil
suit
or
is
it
a
case
where
there
was
a
serious
purpose
in
presenting
it
to
the
grand
jury
of
getting
an
indictment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
wasn't
always
the
policy.
justice
john
m.
harlan
except
the
deposition,
isn't
fair.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
as
justice
frankfurter
just
pointed
out,
the
sherman
act
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

--
occasion
arises,
is
that
the
exception
to
you're
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
correa,
supposing
the
court
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
have
done
originally
on
its
own
initiative
what
it
already
done
in
the
amended
order,
would
there
been
a
--
would
the
government
could
have
--
could
the
government
have
appealed
from
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
the
question
here
is
whether
there
was
a
waiver
of
some
kind?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
was
just
thinking.
supposing
this
was
a
mistaken
concept
with
the
government,
unwise
maneuver
but
still
the
record
shows
that
they
thought
that
was
the
way
to
go.
but,
i
don't
quite
see
where
they're
at
accordingly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
was
a
conscious
waiver.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
do
you
--
is
your
position
--
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
it
appears
that
a
civil
antitrust
case
has
been
the
subject
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings,
then
without
more,
the
defendants
should
be
entitled
to
see
the
minutes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
--
you
got
almost
that
situation
it
seems
to
me
on
this
rather
marvelous
record
because
the
judge
i
take
it
didn't
look
at
the
grand
jury
minutes,
you're
in
no
position
obviously
to
say
what
was
in
them.
the
government
refused
to
say
what
was
in
them.
so,
it
seems
to
me
it
almost
comes
down
to
be
brought
on
a
framework
as
i've
indicated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
government
had
call
in
all
of
these
witnesses
and
examined
them,
the
antitrust
division
office
is
acceptable.
did
you
get
all
the
statements?
suppose
it
hadn't
been
a
grand
jury,
you
had
it
transferred
to
--
in
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it's
also
true
however,
that
in
recognizing
the
traditional
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings,
that
the
government
is
in
that
position
in
this
cases
where
they
examine
an
important
witness,
they
are
taking
before
the
grand
jury
for
very
good
reasons.
they
again
under
oath
and
he
know
and
you
know
right
from
the
minute
that
you
do
that,
but
of
course
you're
going
to
call
it
so
at
the
trial.
and
this
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
in
the
context
of
these
antitrust
cases
in
preparation
of
civil
suits
is
a
wholly
different
proposition
to
me
than
what
it
is
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
criminal
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
kind
of
showing
do
you
--
would
you
conceive
the
defendants
here
should
have
made
in
order
to
overcome
the
factor
of
secrecy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
they
know
it's
of
the
transcript?
