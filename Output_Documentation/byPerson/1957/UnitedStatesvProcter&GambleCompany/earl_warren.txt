mr.
bicks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
make
--
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
--
the
request
for
the
entire
transcript
and
just
a
part
of
it?
i
noticed
you
emphasized
that
the
entire
transcript.
now,
would
--
would
the
issue
be
same
if
they
--
if
they
asked
for
less?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
that's
all
that
you've
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
was
some
mention
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
--
that
there
was
some
admission
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
the
grand
jury
was
used
that
time
solely
for
--
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
for
a
civil
suit.
am
i
incorrect
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand,
mr.
bicks,
that
from
your
argument
that
the
government
gave
the
defense
a
list
of
the
witnesses
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
plus
a
summary
of
their
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
i
--
i
misunderstood
you.
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bicks,
i
understand
that
the
appellees
say
that
the
--
the
judge
had
several
sanctions
that
he
could
impose
for
your
failure
to
turn
this
over
and
that
you
chose
to
have
him
select
this
one.
namely,
to
dismiss
the
lawsuit
which
is
tantamount
to
you
asking
a
--
as
a
--
as
they
say
for
a
nonsuit
against
him.
and
that
therefore,
you
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
if
the
judge
acted
in
that
--
in
that
manner,
therefore
you're
--
you're
not
properly
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bicks,
may
i
ask
you
this.
if
--
if
we
sustain
the
court
below,
is
it
a
judgment
on
the
merits?
