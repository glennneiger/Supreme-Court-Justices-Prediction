mr.
robert
a.
bicks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appealed
from
the
new
jersey
district
court's
dismissal
of
its
antitrust
civil
complaint.
the
complaint
had
alleged
violations
of
the
sherman
act,
sections
1
and
2
and
named
these
defendants
three
major
soap
concern,
proctor
and
gamble,
colgate,
and
lever
brothers,
as
well
as
the
trade
association
to
which
all
three
belong.
the
district
court's
dismissal
in
turn,
stamped
on
the
fact
that
the
united
states
did
not
turn
over
to
the
civil
defendants
the
complete
grand
jury
transcript
of
all
testimony.
whether
or
not
relevant
to
the
civil
case,
by
all
witnesses,
whether
or
not
to
appear
in
the
civil
case,
who
had
testified
before
a
grand
jury
conducting
criminal
investigation
into
the
same
soap
and
synthetic
detergent
industry.
the
prime
issue
on
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
we
do
make
a
decision,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
reason
we
do
is
that
our
basic
position
is
that
in
each
particular
case,
a
demand
to
pierce
if
you
will
or
cast
aside
the
traditional
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury.
i
must
depend
in
each
instance
on
a
delicate
balance
between
on
the
one
hand,
those
policy
of
the
grand
jury
secrecy
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury
and
on
the
other,
the
need
of
a
particular
civil
defendant
for
a
particularly
be
a
grand
jury
testimony
for
a
particular
purpose.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
will.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
issue
on
this
appeal
then
is
what
kind
of
showing
of
good
cause
within
the
meaning
of
rule
34,
must
a
civil
defendant
make
out
to
warrant
blanket
production
of
the
entire
transcript
of
a
grand
jury
that
have
been
discharged
without
returning
an
indictment,
some
two-and-half
weeks
before
the
civil
complaint
was
filed
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
issue
was
not
raised
below,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
court
below
assumed
that
because
the
government
was
concededly
using
the
grand
jury
transcripts
and
had
used
it
to
prepare
its
civil
case,
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
transcript
at
least
would
be
useful
to
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no.
the
issue
of
relevance
was
not
primarily
raised
below,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
move
directly
to
the
factual
context
which
gives
rise
to
this
paramount
issue
and
thereafter
trade
issues
raised
by
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss.
from
may
1951
to
november
1952,
a
criminal
grand
jury
sat
in
newark,
new
jersey,
as
the
antitrust
division
trial
attorney
charged
with
presenting
evidence
to
that
grand
jury,
put
it
in
the
record
before
you
at
page
55.
he
was
instructed
to
and
did
carry
out
investigation
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
been
criminal
violation.
in
the
course
of
this
task,
the
grand
jury
heard
some
28
witnesses.
of
these
28
witnesses,
18
were
present
or
former
employees
of
those
who
became
defendants
in
the
later
civil
suit.
beyond
those
18
witnesses,
an
additional
6
witnesses
represented
concerns
presumably
from
whom
defendants
bought
or
to
whom
they
sold.
the
grand
jury
completed
its
deliberations
in
late
1952.
it
was
discharged
on
november
25th,
1952
without
returning
any
indictment.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
record
does
not
show
whether
or
not
they
voted
or
whether
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
uniform
purpose
of
the
antitrust
division
--
policy
of
the
antitrust
division
is
not
to
convene
a
grand
jury
unless
criminal
prosecution
is
likely.
in
this
particular
case,
that's
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
so
long
as
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
have
no
direct
knowledge
of
what
the
practice
has
been
before
1953.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
and
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
believe
you
are,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
admission
i
referred
to
was
a
particular
bit
of
testimony
before
a
house
committee
by
assistant
attorney
general
barnes.
judge
barnes
there
stated
that
he
felt
free
to
proceed
solely
civilly
on
the
basis
of
a
grand
jury
investigation.
if
--
provided
if
the
grand
jury
was
in
fact
convened
in
good
faith
to
investigate
a
criminal
violation.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
some
two-and-half
weeks
after
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
have
endeavored
to
check
with
those
who
were
supervising
the
then
grand
jury.
i
am
informed
that
no
indictment
was
recommended
to
the
grand
jury.
i
further
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
bit
different
from
the
statements
where
the
integrity,
if
you
will,
of
our
use
of
a
grand
jury
isn't
put
at
issue,
that
in
fact
no
indictment
was
recommended.
some
two-and-half
weeks
after
the
grand
jury
was
discharged,
the
civil
complaint
at
issue
here
was
filed.
as
the
first
step
after
the
civil
complaint
was
filed,
the
civil
defendants
were
offered
the
return
in
those
grand
jury
documents
which
they've
given
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
i
would
rather
put
it
in
the
adverse
that
there
must
be
some
reasonable
judgment
at
the
time
a
grand
jury
is
authorized
that
criminal
proceeding
is
likely.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
once
the
grand
jury
is
in
good
faith
convened
and
properly
conducted,
then
of
course
the
united
states
feels
free.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
after
the
grand
jury
documents
were
offered
to
return
the
defendant
then
began
to
process
a
mutual
discovery.
the
government
filed
two
discovery
functions,
emphasizing
that
discovery
was
to
a
be
a
two-way
street,
however,
the
government
turned
over
the
defendants,
all
third
party
documents
in
the
government's
possession
where
third
parties
had
consented.
beyond
that,
the
united
states
supplied
to
defendant
a
comprehensive
listing
of
additive
statements
of
issues
on
the
civil
case.
in
the
midst
of
this
mutual
discovery
process,
about
two-and-half
years
--
two
years
after
the
civil
complaint
has
been
filed,
the
defendant
proctor
and
gamble
moved
for
access
to
the
transcripts
of
grand
jury
testimony.
it
was
not
until
one
year
later,
however,
in
late
1955
when
the
government
sought
to
take
the
deposition
of
a
proctor
official
who
would
testify
before
the
grand
jury,
that
proctor
pressed
its
motion
for
argument.
at
about
the
same
time,
defendants
--
the
remaining
defendants
made
like
motions.
the
argument
was
heard
on
those
motions
in
late
1955
and
in
april
1956,
the
court
rendered
its
opinion
indicating
that
the
government
would
be
required
to
turn
over
the
entire
transcripts
of
grand
jury
testimony.
the
basis
for
the
court's
opinion
is
summarized
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
he
did
not
in
april,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
he
did
by
order
dated
july
24.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
basis
for
the
court's
conclusion
is
summarized
in
the
last
paragraph
of
its
opinion
found
in
the
record
before
you
at
page
218.
there,
the
court
stated
that
the
court
concludes
that
since
plaintiff
is
using
the
transcripts
containing
relevant
information,
the
ends
of
justice
require
the
court
to
order
plaintiff
to
produce
and
permit
the
inspection
and
copy
by
defendants
of
the
transcript.
equal
use
of
the
transcripts
by
defendants
will
give
them
the
fullest
possible
knowledge
of
the
facts
before
trial.
none
of
the
reasons
for
the
rule
of
secrecy
apply.
after
denying
the
government's
motion
for
reconsideration,
the
court
on
august
21,
1956
ended
its
amended
orders
specifying
that
if
the
united
states
did
not
turn
over
the
transcripts,
the
civil
complaint
would
be
dismissed.
after
checking
to
ascertain
that
the
united
states
had
not
turned
over
the
transcripts,
the
orders
of
dismissal
that
dated
september
13th,
1956
were
ended.
it
is
from
these
orders
of
dismissal
with
the
united
states
appeal.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no,
it
was
not,
mr.
justice
black.
the
orders
of
dismissal
dated
september
13th
stemmed
from
the
government's
failure
to
turn
over
the
grand
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
sequence
of
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
there
is.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
oh,
that
is
that
contention
of
defendant.
i
think
that
those
contentions
take
on
meaning
after
a
whole
statement
of
the
grand
jury
issue.
the
essence
of
the
government's
position
can
be
briefly
summarized.
initially
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
requiring
turn
over
rested
on
three
ground.
first,
that
the
united
states
had
been
using
and
was
using
the
grand
jury
transcript
to
prepare
a
civil
case.
second,
that
it
would
be
useful
to
the
defendant
to
have
the
grand
jury
transcript
to
prepare
their
case.
and
third,
traditional
reasons
for
grand
jury
secrecy
no
longer
apply.
at
the
outset,
let
me
make
clear
that
there's
no
question
whether
the
united
states
was
using
transcripts
to
prepare
a
civil
case.
indeed
the
attorney
general
is
obliged
once
the
grand
jury
has
been
lawfully
convened
and
properly
conducted
to
make
use
of
evidence
it
adduces
in
the
fullest
performance
of
those
public
responsibilities
congress
has
placed
upon
it.
beyond
that
we
have
no
reason
to
disagree
that
access
to
the
transcripts
would
be
one
useful
tool
for
defendants
to
prepare
their
case.
indeed,
this
would
be
likely
be
so
in
every
complex
civil
case
following
a
grand
jury
investigation.
our
sole
disagreement
with
the
court
below
stems
from
our
view
that
the
basic
integrity
of
grand
jury
process
requires
that
with
limited
exception,
secrecy
surround
that
testimony
given
before
even
beyond
the
grand
jury's
discharge.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
precisely,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
from
this
it
follows
that
each
exception
to
the
traditional
rule
of
grand
jury
secrecy
must
be
based
on
a
delicate
balance
between
on
the
one
hand,
the
reasons
underlying
the
rule
of
the
grand
jury
secrecy
and
on
the
other,
the
need
of
a
civil
defendant
for
a
particular
bit
of
testimony
for
a
particular
purpose.
this
delicate
balance,
the
court
below
does
not
deem
it
necessary
to
undertake.
the
court
concluded
that
there
were
no
reason
which
had
survived
the
grand
jury's
life,
which
any
longer
support
of
the
need
for
secrecy.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
some
of
it.
the
result
was
a
blanket
turnover
order
on
a
showing
of
good
cause,
no
greater
than
that
would
be
required
for
any
routine
document
in
the
government's
possession.
the
essence
of
the
government's
disagreement
with
the
court
below
then
is
our
view
that
due
weight
must
be
given
to
those
policies
underlying
the
need
for
grand
jury
secrecy,
policies
equally
lofty
too
though
sometimes
apparently
at
odds
with
the
broad
disclosure
design
of
the
civil
rule.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
mr.
chief
justice,
when
defendants
moved
for
access
to
grand
jury
transcripts
at
that
time,
they
said,
we
have
long
known
the
names
of
most
if
not
all
the
witnesses.
beyond
that,
at
argument
on
the
government's
motion
for
reconsideration,
the
government
reiterated
its
offer
to
give
defendants
a
list
of
all
witness.
in
fact,
it
developed
defendants
had
known
the
names
of
each
witnesses.
the
government
did
not
offer
to
give
summaries
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
essence
of
the
government's
disagreement
then
that
the
court
below
failed
to
give
due
weight
to
the
policies
underlying
the
need
for
grand
jury
secrecy.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
united
states
v.
johnson,
and
reiterated
only
recently
in
the
costello
case,
entered
role
to
the
administration
of
federal
criminal
justice
that
the
institution
of
the
independent
grand
jury.
indispensable
to
the
grand
jury's
function,
it
follows
that
the
ability
to
compel
on
travel
disclosure
by
witnesses
before
it
of
all
data
within
their
knowledge.
such
ability
would
be
dissipated
we
urge,
where
witnesses
to
know
their
testimony
would
be
disclosed
even
short
of
trial
to
those
very
person
on
whose
witnesses
economic
existence
depend.
the
call
from
this
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
johnson,
intrusion
into
the
indispensable
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
as
important
for
the
protection
of
the
innocent
of
the
pursuit
of
the
guilt
would
subvert
the
grand
jury
secrecy
--
would
subvert
the
grand
jury's
function
by
all
sorts
of
devices
which
some
state's
opinion
could
permit
such
as
(inaudible)
inspection
of
grand
jury
minutes.
from
this
involved
that
the
government's
position
basically
is
that
the
basis
of
integrity
in
grand
jury
process
requires
that
secrecy
surround
testimony,
even
after
the
grand
jury's
discharge
absent
any
but
the
strongest
and
most
particularized
sort
of
showing
that
basic
justice
requires
to
the
contrary.
that
sort
of
showing
for
the
government's
view
was
not
made
here.
initially
at
the
time
motions
were
made
for
access
to
the
grand
jury
minute,
defendants
conceded
that
they
knew
the
names
of
most
if
not
all
the
people
that
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
beyond
that,
the
record
is
barren
of
any
efforts
by
defendant
to
secure
via
deposition
an
alternative
means
to
learning
the
facts
within
witnesses
present
knowledge
to
secure
by
alternative
means
such
as
deposition,
relevant
facts
within
grand
jury
witnesses,
present
knowledge
was
found.
there
was
no
effort
that
they
tried
the
deposition
route.
in
short,
there's
no
basis
for
concluding
that
whatever
present
recollection
grand
jury
witnesses
had
as
to
facts
relevant
to
the
civil
complaint
could
not
have
been
secured
by
some
process
other
than
access
to
the
grand
jury
transcript.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
i
had
assumed
there
was
no
real
question
below
as
to
whether
the
united
states
was
using
the
transcript.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
believe
it
would
be.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
that
--
that
maybe
a
fair
account
of
what
happened
below
but
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
really
any
question
as
to
what
the
relation
between
the
grand
jury
proceedings
in
the
government's
civil
suit
were.
both
involved
an
investigation
of
antitrust
violation
in
the
same
industry.
i
think
it
certainly
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
much
of
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
would
bear
on
issues
that
were
relevant
in
a
civil
case.
however,
equally
clearly,
there's
no
basis
for
concluding
that
all
of
it
would,
which
was
the
sole
reason
i
raised
the
point
of
relevance
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
however
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
we
do.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
say
that
much
of
the
information
that
formed
the
basis
for
the
government's
civil
complaint
was
adduced
for
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
say
that
there
are
--
the
issue
of
the
government's
use
and
an
implied
waiver
by
the
government
of
whatever
by
such
use
of
grand
jury
secrecy
may
arise
at
two
different
concepts.
first,
at
trial,
when
the
government
gets
the
trial,
if
it
does,
will
not
much
of
what
went
on
before
the
grand
jury
to
be
revealed.
there
are
three
answers
to
that
contention.
first,
the
great
bulk
of
civil
antitrust
cases
do
not
reach
trial,
roughly
75%
are
settled
before
trial.
second,
even
as
to
those
cases
that
reach
trial,
a
crucial
element
of
prosecutor's
judgment
is
the
balance
between
on
the
one
hand,
the
need
to
call
a
particular
witness
to
make
a
case.
and
on
the
other,
the
need
to
protect
a
particular
witness
from
economic
harm
that
may
come
to
him
by
putting
him
on
the
stand.
third,
even
if
the
case
is
trialed
and
even
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
use
a
particular
witness,
then
left
in
a
very
carefully
exercised
discretion
of
the
court
at
the
expense
to
which
that
--
particular
witness'
grand
jury
testimony
will
be
exposed.
so
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
suggest
that
in
practical
terms,
the
use
--
the
proceeding
by
the
united
states
to
trial
or
prosecution
of
the
civil
case
does
not
in
effect
constitute
a
waiver
or
intrusion
into
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
is
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
can't
--
no,
i
say
it
may
arise
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
because
the
government
also
takes
the
position
that
situations
at
pretrial
may
arise,
where
a
district
court
may
feel
on
the
basis
of
a
strong
and
particularized
showing,
that
basic
justice
requires
some
intrusion
into
some
portion
of
the
grand
jury
transcript.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
not
--
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
--
to
a
response
to
your
question
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
it
does
not
inevitably
follow
that
there
will
ever
be
an
intrusion
in
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
is
not,
because
there's
a
situation
short
of
trial
where
even
though
we're
not
going
to
use
the
witness,
where
a
court
might
within
the
proper
bounds
of
rule
34,
direct
that
part
of
a
transcript
be
turned
over.
for
example
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
oh,
yes,
rule
6
(e)
specifically
provides
that
attorneys
--
attorneys
in
the
government
maybe
present
in
the
course
of
grand
jury
proceedings.
and
the
information
there
adduced,
and
the
quote
is,
"maybe
made
available
to
the
attorneys
for
the
government,
for
the
use
in
the
performance
of
their
duties."
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
is.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
oh,
he
might
not.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
initially
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
prosecutor
presenting
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
he
will
take
notes
or
have
a
stenographer
present
to
take
a
transcript.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
and
as
a
matter
of
convenience
and
as
used
after
the
grand
jury
has
been
discharged,
he
may
desire
to
have
a
transcript
to
refresh
his
memories
of
what
happened
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
was
just
attempting
to
explain,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
why
it
would
not
be
because
the
fact
of
government
use
does
not
necessarily
mean
disclosure
of
what
happened
before
the
grand
jury
to
anyone
but
those
government's
attorneys
who
were
properly
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
i
am.
the
sort
of
showing
of
good
cause
here
made
by
defendants
was
almost
entirely
conclusory.
as
i've
indicated
they
conceded
they
knew
the
names
of
most
if
not
all
of
the
witnesses
and
in
fact
the
government
calls
for
the
complete
list
of
the
witnesses.
beyond
that,
the
record
is
barren
of
any
effort
to
secure
relevant
information
by
deposition.
and
indeed,
defendant
colgate
conceded
that
they
well
could
take
deposition
of
all
the
grand
jury
witnesses
whose
names
they
knew.
the
government's
position
then
that
this
is
--
that
this
sort
of
conclusory
allegation
cannot
suffice
to
make
out
a
showing
of
good
cause.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
do
not
believe
so,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
there
are
two
sorts
of
areas
that
could
be
searched
by
deposition.
first,
all
knowledge
within
the
present
like
recollection
of
a
deponent
relevant
to
the
civil
case.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
do
not
believe
they
could
ask,
however,
or
search
via
deposition
from
a
deponent
a
blank
question
of
tell
me
everything
you
told
the
grand
jury.
that's
--
that's
really
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
government's
position
is
that
allowing
a
blanket
turn
over
of
all
grand
jury
transcripts
based
on
the
sort
of
showing
required
here
would
seriously
debilitate
the
grand
jury's
use
in
the
wide
area
of
commercial
crimes
that
attacks
antitrust,
pure
food
and
drug
act
administration.
where
the
same
act
may
give
rise
to
both
a
criminal
and
civil
proceeding.
in
the
antitrust
field
for
example,
the
government
uniquely
depends
on
information
in
the
hands
of
potential
defendant.
as
this
court
put
it
in
hale
and
henkel,
the
combinations
and
conspiracies
against
which
the
sherman
act
provides
and
ordinarily
can
prove
only
by
the
testimony
of
parties
thereto
and
the
person
of
their
offices
or
agents.
so
it
was
within
this
grand
jury,
18
of
the
28
witnesses
were
present
were
former
employees,
those
who
later
became
defendants
in
a
civil
suit.
our
position
is
that
the
ability
of
the
grand
jury
to
compel
these
witness
to
speak
their
mind,
to
conjecture
if
you
will,
to
come
forth
with
that
sort
of
evidence,
which
allay
grand
jury
a
body
of
laymen
may
find
persuasive.
whether
or
not
it's
evidence
in
the
court
of
law,
will
be
seriously
challenged
if
those
grand
jury
witnesses
know.
but
on
the
basis
of
this
sort
of
showing
which
can
be
made
in
any
complex
civil
case,
their
testimony
will
be
disclosed
to
those
on
whom
their
economic
livelihood
depend.
in
some,
the
essence
of
the
government's
position
is
that
we
take
no
flat
position
that
in
no
civil
case,
either
at
trial
or
before
trial,
will
a
grand
jury
transcript
or
particular
portions
of
it
be
made
available
to
defendants.
instead
in
each
instances,
the
trial
court's
task
is
to
balance
on
the
one
hand,
the
need
for
grand
jury
secrecy
against
on
the
other,
the
considerations
of
fairness
involved
in
a
particular
civil
defendant's
needs
for
a
particular
bit
of
grand
jury
testimony
for
a
particular
purpose.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
case
should
be
reversed,
the
--
and
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
requiring
turn
over
should
be
reversed,
because
it
would
face
not
on
the
sort
of
balancing
process
i
suggest
but
integral
to
the
decision
below
by
its
own
terms.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
government
did
not
state
below,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
in
no
case,
in
no
civil
case
would
the
antitrust
would
be
--
should
the
grand
jury
transcript
be
turned
over,
just
as
it
does
not
so
to
state
here.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
do
not
believe
so.
such
a
motion
really
would
follow
the
path
that
the
government
suggest
and
that
is
to
go
ahead,
go
ahead
by
deposition.
if
for
example,
a
man
who
have
testified
before
the
grand
jury
later
on
deposition
said,
“i
can't
remember
whether
i
was
present
at
x
meeting.”
but
does
recall
that
he
did
remember
at
the
time
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
and
if
x
meeting
did
bear
closely
on
the
issue
to
the
civil
case
in
such
an
instance
where
a
deponent
had
forgotten
between
the
two
meeting,
that
might
be
an
appropriate
case
for
the
district
court
to
consider
whether
he
would
permit
the
witness
to
refresh
his
recollection
by
a
recourse
to
a
particular
bit
of
testimony.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
ever
made
what
showing?
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
simply
by
asking
the
deponent
the
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
"were
you
present
at
x
meeting?"
the
deponent
would
then
reply,
“i
do
not
now
recall
whether
i
was
present
at
x
meeting.”
the
defendants
would
then
respond,
“did
you
recall
at
the
time
you
testified
before
the
grand
jury?”
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
and
deponent
might
then
reply,
“i
think
i
did.”
then
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
precisely.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
in
the
particular
situation
where
we've
been
describing,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
district
court
might
well
examine
that
portion
of
the
transcript
and
see
for
himself
whether
deponent
had
in
fact
recollected
a
particular
transaction
before
the
grand
jury.
well,
that's
the
essence
of
the
government's
position
and
that
this
basic
balancing
judgment
must
be
made
underneath
for
a
particular
bit
of
testimony,
for
a
particular
purpose
and
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
the
demand
for
a
blanket
transcript
whether
or
not
relevant
to
a
particular
purpose,
which
is
why
i
emphasized
the
element
of
relevance.
this
balance
was
not
undertaken
below
because
the
district
court
stated
why
it
fall,
the
incident
in
its
opinion
that
its
view
not
of
the
reasons
for
grand
jury
secrecy.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
motion
was
made
in
the
midst
of
pretrial
discovery,
long
before
trial
was
imminent
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
deposition
had
not
yet
began.
the
government
had
filed
two
discovery
motions,
had
turned
over
third
party
document
and
it
was
just
--
as
the
government
sought
to
take
the
deposition
of
one
of
proctor
and
gamble's
official,
that
the
motion
was
brought
on.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
proctor
and
gamble
motion,
original
motion
for
access
to
the
grand
jury
transcript
took
place
in
september,
i
believe,
of
1954.
it
was
brought
on
argument
after
the
government
sought
to
take
proctor
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
no.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
in
november
11,
1952.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
11th.
we
do
--
excuse
me,
december
11,
1952.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
process
of
discovery
would
be
the
general
description,
i
think.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
say
so,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
government
filed
two
extensive
--
two
discovery
motions,
one
at
least
of
which
was
quite
extensive.
there
has
been
a
turn
over
of
third
party
documents,
there's
been
--
been
a
preparation
of
a
tentative
statement
of
issues.
and
in
addition,
sometime
have
been
occupied
internally
within
the
department
surveying
what
the
broad
direction
the
entire
case
should
take.
there
have
been
some
changes,
department
heads
between
the
time
the
case
was
filed
when
the
pretrial
begun.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
roughly,
three
years.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
would
have
to
be
done
exactly
as
you
described,
piecemeal
as
a
particular
situation
arose.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
particular
portion
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
precisely.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
we
do
not,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
our
position
is
that
the
court
misapplied
the
standard
of
good
cause
as
a
matter
of
law
within
34.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
precisely.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
is
precisely
their
contention.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
--
i
would
respond
by
first
reciting
very
briefly
the
chronicle
of
events
on
which
the
defendant's
contention
depends.
the
district
court
in
april
of
1956
had
rendered
its
opinion
saying
the
united
states
would
be
obliged
to
turn
over
the
transcript.
after
denying
the
united
states'
motion
for
reconsideration
in
july
of
1956,
the
court
on
july
24th,
1956
entered
its
first
turn
over
order.
the
july
24th,
1956
order
specified
or
obliged
the
united
states
to
turn
over
any
and
all
grand
jury
transcripts
within
30
days.
some
eight
days
before
that
july
24th
order,
30-day
deadline
was
to
expire.
in
short,
on
august
16th,
of
1956,
the
united
states
moved
alternatively
to
stay
the
order's
effectiveness
so
its
validity
could
be
tested
on
appeal,
or
to
amend
the
order
to
specify
that
if
the
united
states
did
not
produce
the
transcript,
the
complaint
would
be
dismissed.
the
reasons
for
that
motion
stated
by
an
affidavit
that
the
attorney
general
submitted
at
the
time
the
august
16th
motion
was
made.
he
said,
“it
is
my
considered
judgment.”
it
would
be
unseemly
for
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
united
states
to
be
placed
in
the
dilemma.
either
of
having
to
comply
with
the
court
order
which
he
considers
erroneous
and
compliance
with
which
he
deems
contrary
to
public
interest
or
alternately
they
would
--
being
required
to
disobey
the
order
without
first
having
an
opportunity
for
effective
appellate
review
of
the
order.
the
government's
motion
was
brought
on
for
argument
soon
after
it
was
made
on
august
16,
defendants
acquiesced
in
the
court's
amendment
with
july
24th
order.
the
order
was
amended
august
21st
to
provide
that
if
the
united
states
did
not
turn
over
the
transcript,
the
case
would
be
dismissed.
when
the
august
24th
deadline
expired,
the
court
wrote
defendants
as
well
as
the
united
states
to
determine
if
in
fact
the
transcripts
have
been
turned
over.
when
the
court
determined
that
the
united
states
had
failed
to
turn
over
the
transcript,
the
september
the
13th
dismissal
order
from
which
the
united
states
here
appeals
were
entered.
against
this
background
of
event,
the
united
states
replied
to
defendant's
contention
has
three
(inaudible)
first,
that
the
united
states
appeals
not
from
the
august
21st
amended
order
but
rather
from
the
september
13th
dismissal
order.
the
september
13th
dismissal
order
in
turn
was
not
the
inevitable
result
of
the
august
21st
order,
instead
it
was
the
inevitable
result
of
the
united
states'
failure
to
produce
in
response
to
the
august
21st
order.
second,
regarding
the
august
21st
amended
order,
our
position
is
that
the
united
states
did
not
consent
with
the
substance
of
the
august
21st
order.
indeed,
on
two
occasions
it
had
sought
with
all
its
vigor
to
object
to
the
substance
of
the
turnover
order.
instead,
it
sought
merely
to
have
the
court
in
advance
of
the
order's
deadline
specify
what
the
remedy
for
noncompliance
would
be.
this
is
a
--
this
court
said
in
thomsen
and
cayser
is
known
--
thus,
as
this
court
said
in
thomsen
and
cayser,
the
plaintiffs
did
not
consent
to
a
judgment
against
them
but
only
that
if
there
was
to
be
such
a
judgment
it
should
be
final
in
form,
instead
of
interlocutory,
so
that
they
might
come
to
this
court
without
further
delay.
this
case
--
the
government's
position
here
is
even
stronger
than
the
plaintiffs
in
thomsen
and
cayser
because
the
other
remedies
the
court
might
have
applied
would
have
enabled
the
government
likewise
to
appeal
and
indeed
appeal
with
far
less
drastic
consequences
to
the
attorney
general
qua
litigant
in
this
order.
for
example,
had
the
district
court
held
the
attorney
general
in
contempt
and
had
he
appealed,
and
had
the
circuit
court
or
the
supreme
court
later
agreed
that
the
district
court
was
in
error,
or
was
not
in
error,
or
sustained
the
district
court.
then
left
for
the
united
states
would
again
be
the
choice
whether
or
not
to
comply
or
abandon
the
suit.
we've
given
up
that
choice.
the
attorney
general
chose
for
himself
a
path
that
had
no
advantage
to
him
as
a
litigant,
specifying
the
remedy
of
dismissal.
and
his
sole
motive
was
to
avoid
the
unseemly
situation
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
applying
a
court
order.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
there
are
two
contexts
in
which
it
might
have
appealed.
first,
had
the
judge
had
the
transcript
instead
of
the
united
states
and
he
had
--
had
he
been
about
to
turn
it
over,
i
assume
we
might
have
tried
to
appeal
by
extraordinary
writ.
and
second
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that's
right.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
might
have
--
that
might
have
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
dismissal
was
prejudice,
i
say.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
are
there
no
questions?
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
does.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
is.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
it
would.
that
is
the
construction
the
supreme
court
have
put
on
the
rule
in
wallace
and
tiernan.
if
you
recall
there,
a
grand
jury
had
been
legally
constituted,
women
have
been
excluded
from
it.
a
civil
case
would
was
brought
after
the
grand
jury
--
after
the
indictment,
the
grand
jury
returned,
had
been
dismissed,
it's
having
been
returned
by
an
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
the
defendant
from
the
civil
suit
moved
to
quash
the
rule
34
motions
made
by
the
government
on
the
ground
that
the
government
was
making
use
of
information
secured
by
an
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
there's
no
question
that
that
this
grand
jury
was
legally
constituted.
there,
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
district
court
and
enabled
the
united
states
proceed
with
its
civil
suit.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it's
true
that
there
is
no
authority
that
would
prevent
such
use
by
the
government
but
it's
equally
true,
that
it
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
that
that
time
to
turn
over
those
portions
to
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
that
grant
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i'd
like
to,
if
i
may
to
meet
one
of
mr.
fortas'
argument
directly.
the
gist
of
it
is
that
matters
of
administrative
convenience,
expedition
and
the
handling
of
a
big
case
justify
the
order
of
the
law.
initially,
it
may
well
be
subject
to
challenge
as
to
just
how
much
the
blanket
turn
over
the
grand
jury
transcripts
would
expedite
the
case.
indeed,
government
counsel
asked
that
argument.
well,
if
you
had
the
transcript
would
that
mean,
you
wouldn't
take
deposition
and
response
would
instantly
be,
no.
but
even
assuming,
this
would
expedite
the
handling
of
the
case
is
that
a
full
answer.
must
we
not
proceed
further
and
say
is
it
worth
it
in
terms
of
what
this
does
to
the
traditional
function
of
a
grand
jury.
the
essential
position
of
the
government
is
that
it
must
be,
if
a
grand
jury
minutes
are
to
be
opened
up
in
this
wholesale
fashion
on
the
account
of
showing
and
i
--
my
own
view
is
mr.
justice
harlan,
correctly
characterized
as
the
sort
of
showing
that
could
be
made
not
only
in
every
antitrust
case
but
indeed
in
every
complex
civil
case
that
follows
the
grand
jury.
if
consideration
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
my
i
respond
to
your
point
about,
he
knows
he'll
be
called
to
trial
initially,
three
out
of
four
of
every
one
of
the
government
civil
cases
never
reached
trial.
so,
in
three
of
the
four
cases,
he
has
no
reason
to
believe
it's
a
total
trial.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
that
is
true.
yes,
sir.
but
there
is
no
fear.
there
is
no
likely,
but
of
exposure
of
particular
witness's
cases
in
three
of
the
four
civil
cases.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
i
would
have
indicated
precisely
that
it
is
not
the
government's
burden
to
point
out
particular
portions
of
the
transcripts
that
should
not
be
shown
to
the
government
--
to
the
defendant
but
rather
it's
the
defendant's
burden
to
make
out
good
cause
for
disclosure
on
a
particular
case
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
--
there
are
two
examples
that
come
to
mind,
of
where
i
think
a
showing
a
good
cause
might
have
been
made
here,
even
if
an
advance
for
trial.
first,
one
of
the
28
witnesses
had
died
between
the
testimony
of
grand
jury
in
court.
there
is
no
effort
to
distinguish
the
demand
that
his
testimony
however,
from
all
the
others.
if
an
addition
to
his
death,
it
could
have
been
shown
exactly
that
he
was
likely
to
have
been
in
a
position
to
speak
with
unique
insight
about
facts
relevant
to
the
pending
civil
proceeding.
on
the
basis
of
that
sort
of
showing,
i
think,
the
court
after
inspection
of
his
testimony
by
--
by
the
court
determine
if
in
fact
before
on
pending
civil
proceeding
might
well,
have
been
justified
in
pointing
the
defendant
had
shown
good
cause
within
the
meaning
of
rule
34.
another
instance
which,
i
think,
would
make
out
a
showing
of
good
cause
is
the
example
i
used
previously
of
a
witness
who
could
not
recollect
at
the
deposition
stage
whether
or
not
he
had
done
a
particular
act
or
attended
the
meeting,
but
did
recollect
the
deposition
stage
that
he
recalled,
whether
or
not
he
had
when
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
there
to,
assuming
external
evidence
showed
that
that
witness
was
likely
to
be
in
a
position
to
speak
with
some
insight
as
to
the
facts
that
occurred,
the
district
judge
might
be
warranted
in
finding
good
cause.
for
the
turn
over
of
a
particular
better
transcript
but
not
for
the
blanket
turnover
of
the
whole.
and
again
really,
our
position
is
much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
the
government
never
asserted
any
limitations
on
the
order,
never
attempted
to
mold
the
order
to
what
it
thought
were
appropriate
limitations.
but
really,
that
wasn't
our
role
at
that
point.
it's
not
the
role
of
the
government
to
call
out
of
the
transcript
those
portions
that
should
not
be
disclosed.
instead
it's
the
role
of
defendants
to
prove
good
cause,
that
particular
portion
should
be.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
essence
of
our
position
is
that
it
really
sounds
strong
and
particularized
showing
it's
necessary.
i've
tried
to
indicate
the
sort
of
showing
that
i
think
would
have
met
that
test
in
this
case,
pretrial.
the
--
the
general
and
conclusory
allegations
for
good
cause
that
were
made
would
suffice
to
warrant
production
of
grand
jury
transcripts
and
most
every
complex
civil
case.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
would
think
so.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
i
think
so.
i
--
i'd
like
in
closing
to
touch
on
a
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
at
mr.
royall.
you
asked
did
mr.
royall
suspicion
or
conclude
that
the
grand
jury
was
in
fact
used
primarily
in
prepare
the
civil
litigation,
either
--
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
well,
he
did
below
--
he
did
below.
mr.
robert
a.
bicks
the
court
below
considered
this
question
at
some
length
and
said
defendant
asserts
that
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
issued
in
bad
faith
and
that
plaintiff
never
really
sought
an
indictment
but
lacking
blocking
the
subpoena
power.
it
used
the
criminal
investigation
as
a
pretense
for
obtaining
documents
on
which
to
base
a
civil
case.
the
assertion
has
not
been
substantiated.
