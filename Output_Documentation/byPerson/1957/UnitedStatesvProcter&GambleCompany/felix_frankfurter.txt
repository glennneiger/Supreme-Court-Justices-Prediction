emphasized
whether
relevant

not.
you
said
that
twice,
is
that
initially
here,
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
come
to
that
in
good
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
i
infer
from
that,
that
you
--
in
part
of
this,
the
context
is
that
what
they
asked
was
not
relevant
and
that
the
court
--
that
disclosure
must
be
made
whether
relevant
or
not
to
this
civil
litigation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.

does
the
record
which
i
have
not
studied,
does
the
record
make
clear
that
there
was
a
contest
below
on
this
issue,
that
they're
asking
for
something
that
wasn't
relevant
to
the
issues
in
this
civil
suit
and
the
court
gave
a
direction
on
the
assumption.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
what
they
ask
is
relevant
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
suggestion
by
the
government
below
that
if
a
showing
is
made
or
reasonable
basis
is
laid
for
inferring
relevance
that
then
disclosure
would
be
made
because
on
the
basis
of
what
you
said
it
seems
to
me
where
it
may
well
be
heading
into
an
abstract
argument
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
of
what
theory
if
you
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
had
some
experience
with
that
too
and
i
wish
i
could
say
that
that
was
a
uniform
practice
when
i
knew
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
it
would
but
if
you
tell
me
that's
the
uniform
practice,
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
period
of
time
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
about
justice
harlan's
question.
is
there
--
i
didn't
get
your
answer.
is
there
a
disclosure
made
whether
there
was
on
both
during
a
proposal
to
indict,
whether
the
u.s.
attorney
told
the
grand
jury,
the
must
to
the
basis
for
indictment
and
then
of
both
returning
not
a
two
bid,
but
that's
made
public
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
the
record
but
that
is
not
made
public
known
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
did,
tell
us
the
fact?
i
thought
i
--
if
one
can
say
there
was
no
indictment
but
--
but
is
the
basis
of
the
blank
objective
fact
that
there
was
no
indictment,
if
there
was
no
indictment,
that's
a
fact.
but
i
didn't
suppose
that
any
disclosure
is
made
that
in
fact
the
u.s.
attorney
recommended
and
in
fact
the
grand
jury
turned
down
his
recommendation,
i
didn't
suppose
that,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
lack
of
integrity,
mr.
bicks,
all
i
meant
to
suggest
is
that
something
very
different
that
you
use
the
grand
jury
item
in
use.
the
government
uses
the
grand
jury
as
a
vehicle
for
ascertaining
what
facts
were
developed
and
then
decide
what
to
do
about
it,
rather
than
having
a
strong
reasonable
conviction
that
there
was
a
criminal
proceeding.
integrity
wasn't
in
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
to
crimes
not
--
as
the
matter
is
not
sherman
law,
would
that
state
have
changed
places,
they
well
may
have.
some
--
some
public
--
something
wrong
happens,
some
external
wrong
and
an
investigation
is
made
through
the
grand
jury
to
find
out
what
the
basis
of
it
is,
that
is
true
as
to
national
banking
--
a
bank
--
a
national
bank
fails.
i
wouldn't
say
to
the
question
of
integrity
that
if
the
u.s.
attorney
goes
in
and
out
of
proceeding
before
the
grand
jury
to
find
out
what
really
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
injection
now
of
the
issue
of
relevance
or
not
with
the
different
complexion
on
the
problem,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
district
court,
trying
to
explore
the
kind
of
use
without
disclosure,
that
the
government
was
making
of
the
material
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
the
government
shut
off
access
to
that
information
to
the
court.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
referring
to
the
inquiry
put
to
mr.
mcdowell,
printed
on
page
13
of
your
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
inability
naturally,
not
from
mr.
mcdowell,
not
to
answer
the
questions
until
he
consulted
with
the
--
his
superiors
in
the
department
and
then
standing
path
on
non-disclosure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
the
judge
asked
some
particular
questions.
i'm
not
saying
that
--
the
specifically
address
themselves
to
the
defendants
in
this
suit
presented,
"will
you
set
forth
in
detail
why
this
will
help
you?"
but
he
did
try
to
open
up
an
inquiry
regarding
the
relation
of
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
to
this
civil
suit
and
the
governor
said
--
and
the
government
in
effect
said,
we
would
answer
your
questions.
we
--
we
stand
a
path
on
the
secrecy,
is
that
right?
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that's
what
i
meant
by
saying
a
little
while
ago,
heading
into
a
rather
abstract
issue
here.
and
i
have
--
and
all
my
predisposition
in
your
direction
about
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
minute.
but
it
is
rather
and
have
a
such
position
that
you
are
taking
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
view
of
the
inquiries
that
--
that
the
district
judge
sought
to
make.
even
start
off
by
saying,
“you
must
make
disclosure.”
he
wanted
to
find
out
what
the
relation
between
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
the
present
civil
proceedings,
and
explore
the
kind
of
questions
that
had
come
from
the
bench.
and
the
government
said,
“nothing
to
do
with.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me
important,
you
emphasized
it
and
i
respect
that
that
they
asked
for
all
of
it
as
though
this
were
--
give
us
all
and
the
government
is
knowing
give
it
all
and
that's
an
end
of
the
business?
that
seems
for
me,
if
i
may
say
so,
an
abstract
in
the
question,
once
you
admit
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
disclosure
maybe
compelled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
bicks,
i
don't
know
--
i'm
a
little
confused.i
don't
know
why
you
don't
say
shortly
that
the
u.s.
attorney,
having
been
before
the
grand
jury
and
actually
having
put
witnesses
due
to
grand
jury
and
having
listened
to
it
all,
what
goes
into
his
head
isn't
an
intrusion,
just
knowledge
at
his
consummate
in
course
of
a
duty.
isn't
that
the
simple
end?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
required
a
statute
to
allow
a
stenographer
to
get
transcripts,
it
becomes
transcripts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
--
could
they
on
deposition
ask
a
witness
what
he
said
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
think
that's
a
dubious
suggestion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
independent
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
hope
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
years
after
the
suit
was
instituted
with
this
proceeding
that
you've
just
recounted
to
take
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
was
filed
in
--
in
early
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
--
early
1953,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
november?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happened
between
december
and
september,
december
1952
and
september
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
--
was
--
they're
at
--
was
there
any
in
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
found
good
cause
and
you
say
he
had
no
business
in
light
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
have
appealed
the
turnover
order
as
such?
was
there
any
mode
returned,
i'm
asking?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
wasn't
true,
he
didn't
have
a
due
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
--
could
that
be
a
direct
--
could
there
have
been
a
direct
appeal
from
that
turnover
order
on
the
period
that
this
was
while
as
it
were
interlocutory,
it
was
one
of
those
interlocutory
situations
which
if
non-appealable
and
obeyed
would
have
--
it
nullified
the
very
ground
of
your
objection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
and
to
trace
that
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
that
under
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
this
the
condition
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
this
a
conditional
or
a
contingent
motion
by
the
government?
i
mean,
if
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
didn't
agree
to
have
the
case
dismissed.
they
said,
if
you
compel
us
to
do
that,
which
we
won't
do,
we
are
legally
right
or
wrong.
we
are
legally
to
take
--
review
this
thing
and
to
obey
it
is
to
defeat
the
very
ground
that
we
thing
the
public
policy
requires
to
resists.
and
how
can
we
deal
with
this
thing,
well
this
is
a
way
of
bringing
it
up.
what
is
--
why
isn't
the
thomsen
case
this
case?
now,
the
thomsen
case
through
the
government,
maybe
it's
not
the
government
but
the
clerk.
i
remember
the
old
doctor
(inaudible)
in
new
york
shouting
his
head
off
when
he
was
thrown
out
of
court
but
that's
not
(inaudible)
with
judge
hough.
and
then
he
said,
"very
well,
the
only
way,
notice
him
going
back
of
his
own
out
again,
if
that's
what
you
hold
and
i
can
sense
in
order
to
get
the
case
up
to
the
same
court."
and
that
was
thomsen
--
the
thomsen
case
was,
mr.
correa?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
wasn't
there
a
judgment
against
to
producing
the
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
his
choice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
did
they
have
a
choice?
if
--
if
you
have
no
choice,
you'll
agree
to
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
choice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
means
--
you
know
very
well
that's
very
doubtful
there,
it's
a
very
doubtful
case
for
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
such
a
proceeding,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
join
you?
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
[laughter]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
my
reading
of
the
opinion
of
this
court,
possibly
because
that
my
bias
is
no
to
favor
these
extraordinary
writs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
a
--
there's
a
qualification
to
the
general
proposition
that
you've
indicated
and
to
which
i
don't
agree,
did
they
refuse
to
--
did
they
refuse
to
submit
the
non-appealable
order
and
go
on
with
the
case
and
take
a
nonsuit.
they
get
a
wrinkle
in
this
case,
is
a
non-appealable
--
assuming
it's
non-appealable,
a
non-appealable
order
which
if
they
obey
makes
futile
any
future
opportunity
to
obey.
any
futile
opportunity
to
review
that
which
they
resist
and
which
they
have
a
right
to
test
in
the
ultimate
court
but
which
they
can
test
on
the
starting
point
that
it's
non-appealable.
ordinarily,
a
non-appealable
order,
you
can
say,
go
ahead
with
the
trial
and
if
it
goes
again,
(inaudible)
this
non-appealable
order
shouldn't
have
been
rendered
against
you.
you
can
then
get
the
judgment
reversed.
but
in
this
case,
the
order
is
one
which
by
fair
nature
if
they
obeyed,
assuming
they
had
no
alternative
but
to
obey
it
or
to
somehow
rather
come
up
here.
if
they
obeyed
it,
there
are
facts
in
the
fire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
raise
this
important
question
which
we
all
agree
even
in
this
case
namely,
the
public
aspects
of
the
disclosure
of
grand
jury
minutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
could
they
do
that
without
making
--
without
having
had
that
very
disclosure
which
the
government
--
i'm
not
now
disclosing
my
thought,
they
are
very
mixed,
i
can
assure
you,
because
all
--
i
was
brought
up
on
judge
hand's
dictum.
but
could
they
do
that
without
having
the
very
disclosure
which
is
the
issue
--
the
main
issue
and
controversy
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
could
get
the
judgment
reversed
if
the
disclosure
order
was
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wouldn't
take
care
of
the
larger
problem
whether
--
about
having
had
secret
minutes
made
public.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
custodian
to
the
record,
mr.
correa?
they're
actually
--
they
are
the
people
who
got
the
physical
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
order
requires
a
disclosure
of
that
physical
thing,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
--
when
you
--
may
i
interrupt
mr.
royall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
deal
with
this
problem,
would
you
like
to
--
in
due
course
to
say
what
response
was
made
to
the
judge's
second
question
on
page
139,
the
question
that
he
addressed
to
defendant's
counsel,
in
due
course.
i
would
like
all
of
the
defendant
counsel
tell
me
exactly
the
production
there
in
your
transcript
(inaudible)
when
you
come
to
it,
not
--
don't
say
it
now,
in
due
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
due
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
colloquy
took
place
after
the
opinion
that
--
that
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
the
opinion
before
this
is
the
one
on
--
the
judge
modarelli's
opinion
and
there
was
--
i
don't
know
what
the
day
was,
the
one
that's
in
page
11
of
the
government's
jurisdictional
statement,
is
that
right?
i
think
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
royall,
you're
not
--
you're
not
suggesting
or
arguing
that
this
would
--
this
was
simply
because
the
government
has
these
minutes,
you
as
an
abstract
proposition,
even
steven
are
entitled
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
have
some
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
reason
that
appears
from
the
record
or
argumentatively
from
what
you're
about
to
tell
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
you
--
suppose
you've
learned
that
the
government
in
preparation
of
a
civil
antitrust
suit,
call
in
an
eminent
lawyer
who
specializes
with
all
sorts
of
views
that
other
people
haven't
got
and
advised
the
government,
and
submitted
an
important
--
to
the
government
an
important
document
indicating
the
way
in
which
they
should
shape
up
the
litigation.
i
don't
suppose
you
would,
on
knowledge
of
that,
assume
it
was
made
public,
assume
the
government
says,
"we
acted
in
this
case,
we
called
in
a
special
counsel,
john
smith,
who
has
given
us
the
basis
of"
--
you
wouldn't
say,
that
because
the
government
has
this
memorandum,
you're
entitled
to
get
it,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
not
suggesting,
at
least
i
haven't
heard
yet,
that
the
claim
is
based
on
the
fact
or
the
belief,
justifiable
belief
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
brought
in
order
to
elicit
this
information
with
a
view
to
the
subsequent
use
of
it,
in
a
civil
suit.
that
is
not
part
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
the
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
wondering
what
the
legal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
--
but
assume
that
one
can
--
is
concerned
with
the
--
with
the
potentialities
of
the
use
of
a
grand
jury
minutes
which
is
a
factor
that,
at
least
in
my
mind,
is
relevant
to
this
problem.
there's
an
allegation
to
this
problem
namely,
that
in
as
much
as
the
government
has
the
facilities
of
a
grand
jury
and
therefore
--
and
therefore,
at
least
has
available
if
used
by
way
of
preparation
for
a
forth
coming
civil
suit,
that
that
is
an
element
in
the
situation
entitling
the
defendant,
with
the
civil
suit
to
get
the
knowledge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
feel
that
the
court's
voluntary
--
is
--
as
two
aspects,
in
relation
to
this
one.
i
go
along
way
with
you
in
saying
that
the
government
agreed
to
a
dismissal
if
the
order
of
production
should
be
sustained.
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
ascent
to
a
dismissal
in
case
that
modarelli's
order
was
the
proper
order.
but
i
think
another
question
is
whether
they
voluntarily
agree
to
the
whole
process
including
the
order
of
production.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
hold
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
present
advice,
i
would
hold
the
government
to
the
consequences
of
their
actions
provided
the
judge's
order
is
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
speaking
of
myself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
had
two
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
government
chooses
to
test
it
this
way,
they
then
did
consent
to
this
disposition
if
they
should
be
wrong.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
had
assented
to,
the
order
of
production.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
short
question,
just
calls
for
a
short
answer.
you
indicated
that
if
this
case
had
to
trial,
the
government,
counsel
for
the
government
would
have
still
in
his
hand
stenographic
minutes
and
ask
witnesses
by
way
of
impeachment
reading
from
the
stenographic
method?
that's
that
what
you
said
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
there
in
the
record
it
indicates,
that
as
a
matter
of
court
that
was
to
be
expected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
mean
more
specifically.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
is
there
in
this
record
that
can
lead
me
to
have
solid
basis
for
saying,
the
government
itself
would
have
in
open
court
used
those
stenographic
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
certainly,
there
is
no
authority.
certainly,
of
this
court
which
would
prevent
the
duty
of
that
by
the
government
have
this
case
go
on
to
a
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
with
the
defense
of
this
order
that
modarelli's
order
thought
to
be
sustained
on
the
ground
that
the
next
charge
was
a
discretion,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
order,
was
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
judge
modarelli
in
the
conduct
of
this
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
did
rather
take
an
absolute
--
i
mean,
the
government
took
an
absolute
disposition
and
i
come
back
in
(inaudible)
case,
the
government
just
took
a
position,
“we're
not
going
to
help
you
judge
modarelli,
you've
been
bothered
by
this
problem,
you're
concerned
with
the
years
that
have
passed.
this
is
of
the
nature
abstractly
considered
a
scandalous
thing
that
we're
here,
six
years
after
this
business
started,”
discussing
whether
some
document
should
have
been
produced.
if
that
is
an
indictment
of
the
administration
of
justice,
i
don't
know
what
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
probe
the
secret
mind,
i
said
he
wasn't
contending,
as
i
understood
him,
he
wasn't
saying.
he
claim
it's
because
in
fact
that
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
this
business
of
constant
digging
out
that
lawyers
said,
although
lawyers
say
a
lot
of
things.
