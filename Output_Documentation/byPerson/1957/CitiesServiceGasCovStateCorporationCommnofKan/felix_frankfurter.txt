justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
accept,
do
you,
from
what
you've
just
said,
the
question
of
--
as
the
appellant
--
appellee
puts
it
in
his
brief.
you
do
not
accept
that
the
question
presented
is
as
stated
in
the
appellees
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
joint
issue
on
their
statement
as
they
see
the
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
natural
gas
act
precludes
the
state
of
kansas
from
prohibiting
withdrawal
of
natural
gas
from
the
underground
common
source
of
supply
except
upon
compliance
with
conditions
necessary
to
prevent
ways
and
protect
correlative
right,
you
accept
to
that
proposition
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
should
be
added
to
prevent
--
not
of
an
aspect
proposition
to
prevent
ways
and
protect
correlative
rights
including
the
condition
of
fixing
minimum
rates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
have
to
be
added,
wouldn't
it,
the
correctness
of
(inaudible)
for
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
questioning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
state
out
the
precise
question
and
you're
not
challenging
how
the
state,
to
prevent
ways
and
protect
correlative
rights,
stated
like
that
out
to
you.
but
you
say
that
this
is
a
statutory
question
--
a
question
statutory
construction
whether
this
power
has
the
rate
has
been
withdrawn
by
the
natural
gas
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
definite
proportion
though?
i
think
a
gas
--
you
can
call
it
fungible
goods.
is
there
a
definite
proportion
that
is
intrastate
commerce
and
interest
to
that
too
that
you
object
to
this
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
kansas
defending
this
order
on
the
ground
that
this
is
regulating
the
price
of
gas
sold
in
kansas?
is
kansas
defending
on
that
ground?
kansas
is
saying
we're
merely
fixing
intrastate
rates
on
intrastate
transactions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
that
is
an
issue
here
that
this
is
in
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
regulation
of
intrastate
sales
in
kansas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
call
it
a
sale
and
--
or
an
attribution
if
in
terms
of
cents,
there
is
compulsory
requirement
by
the
kansas
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
question
gets
back
whatever
word
you
use,
the
characterization
you
make
whether
that
kind
of
compulsion
can
be
exerted
by
kansas,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
to
fuss
around
whether
it's
an
attribution
or
--
or
a
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean,
what
is
the
--
what's
the
legal
significance
of
--
of
fussing
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
attribution
is
by
governmental
authority,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
the
question
comes
back
as
to
the
power
of
the
governmental
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
thing
that
i
can
see,
in
my
limited
way
is
if
the
party
for
some
reason
of
unrelated
to
the
thing
want
to
conceal
the
real
financial
cost
or
payment
and
the
state
says,
“oh
no
you
can't
conceal
this
for
whatever
the
reason
may
be,”
tax
reasons
or
i
don't
know
what.
i
can
see
that
but
there
is
no
such
suggestion
here
that
this
is
a
means
of
kansas
by
which
kansas
reaps
some
false
façade
from
the
transaction,
gives
it
its
true
name.
it's
kansas
that's
doing
something,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
before
we
let
go
with
our
comment,
your
quick
accession
with
justice
harlan's
suggestion,
it
might
bottle
up
the
oil,
kansas
might
bottle
up
the
oil.
i
just
want
to
(inaudible)
that
one
would
have
to
consider,
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia
before
you
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
saying
it
isn't
so.
all
i'm
saying
is,
i
just
have
(inaudible)
in
the
light
of
that
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
it?
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you.
do
i
understand
you
that
the
problem
you've
stated
under
5
--
section
5
arises
when
a
distributer
(inaudible)
pays
the
fix
state
price
but
the
commission
of
its
own
accord
will
disallow
it
on
the
ground
that
it's
an
illegal
fixing,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
cities
service
might
deal
to
this
on
the
part
of
kansas
that
didn't?
what
i
mean
assuming
it
exceeds
to
it,
could
the
commission,
sua
sponte
disallow
that
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
that
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
--
but
that
is
an
unfair
basis
on
which
the
rates
are
to
be
fixed
by
it
or
unfair
as
to
the
capital
account
or
the
income
or
whatever
you
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
problem
--
we've
had
some
difficulties
and
differences,
who
is
entitled
to
get
the
refund
is
that
--
is
that
problem
still
there?
is
that
all
stated
out
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
--
we've
had
our
troubles
with
that
right
here
as
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
money
put
in
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
just
the
bond
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
remember
that
congress
at
least
thought
that
it's
money
is
actually
in
the
treasury
--
of
the
treasury
of
the
court.
we've
got
--
we've
got
a
problem
arising
from
the
fair
distribution
of
the
reason
of
the
possession
of
the
court
if
you
haven't
got
it
on
this
generalized
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
just
between
the
parties
and
poor
consumer
will
be
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
(voice
overlap)
to
state
what
your
view
is
of
the
scope
meaning
of
the
--
the
second
paragraph
in
page
97
of
the
record
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
what
--
what
is
that
mean?
what
(inaudible)
as
meaning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
second
open
paragraph
in
page
97
as
in
the
record,
that's
from
the
opinion
of
your
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
mean
that
the
--
the
gas
in
the
condition
in
which
--
which
is
described
in
that
paragraph
is
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
kansas
said
that
anybody
who
fishes
or
takes
oil
out
of
the
soil,
anybody
who
takes
oil
out
of
the
soil
shall
pay
this
much
of
a
tax.
is
that
what
kansas
had
said?
then
it
said
somebody
who
buys
at
a
particular
point
shall
not
pay
less
because
the
effect
of
that
is
to
conserve
an
important
asset
of
kansas.
that's
what
kansas
has
said,
hasn't
it?
it
has
used
the
price
fixing
in
a
transaction
between
the
cities
service
and
the
hugoton
field
as
a
means
of
not
being
wasteful
about
precious
commodity.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
that
it
--
i'm
not
denying
that
kansas
calls
it
upon
probation
measure.
i'm
not
denying
of
the
fact
it
may
operate
a
conservation
measure.
what
i'm
wondering
is
whether
the
fact
that
both
those
things
are
so,
gives
kansas
a
freehand
if
in
fact
it
charges
apply
for
something
that
is
a
transaction
between
a
seller
and
the
buyer,
the
buyer
happening
to
be
an
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
--
it
is
a
question
whether
it
addresses
because
you
can
sell
it
for
less
(inaudible).
if
there's
a
seller
there
must
be
a
buyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
ask
you
to
turn
to
the
order
of
the
commission.
i
haven't
read
their
interpreted
order.
but
would
any
interpretation
change
what
need
for
me
to
--
to
be
plain
on
xxviii
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
i
got
my
order
of
the
commission
just
for
convenience
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
paragraph
17,
that's
the
finding,
isn't
it?
that's
the
finding
of
the
commission
by
the
premises
finds,
paragraph
17,
finding
17
that
curbs
the
fair
and
reasonable
minimum
price
for
gas
that
the
wellhead
in
the
hugoton
field
is
11
cents,
then
goes
--
that's
the
finding.
that's
--
they
interpret
that
to
mean
anything
of
the
cost
--
that
the
wellhead
price
of
gas
is
a
fair
price
of
11
cents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
subject
to
any
other
meaning
on
what
it
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
don't
care
what
that
means.
well,
anyhow,
that's
what
--
it
says
somebody
who
wants
gas
they
have
to
pay
11
cents
today,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
mean
that
even?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
mean
that
that
if
you
want
the
--
the
fair
price
at
the
wellhead
is
11
cents.
i
have
great
respect
for
ingenuity
of
the
mind.
tell
me
what
it
can
mean
other
than
what
it
says?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
an
abstract
proposition.
well
then
if
it
--
it
implements
that,
then
we
go
to
the
order
in
page
29.
it
is
further
ordered
by
the
commission.
it's
furthered
by
the
commission
order
that
all
person,
firm
or
corporations
which
take
gas
or
cause
gas
to
be
taken
from
the
hugoton
gas
field
in
kansas,
shall
--
certainly,
the
--
the
cities
service
cost
to
be
taken
in
the
sense
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
--
let
me
finish
this
one
before
we
get
to
--
before
you
get
to
it
--
shall
as
the
condition
precedent
for
withdrawal
from
the
common
source
of
supply,
pay
or
attribute
to
all
gas
taken,
except
gas
for
the
operation
of
leases
at
the
wellhead
until
the
further
order
is
11
cents.
now,
the
cities
service
doesn't
come
in
to
the
wellhead
where
it
intervened
in
this
whole
process
or
chain
of
transaction,
was
at
the
wellhead,
wasn't
it?
didn't
--
when
the
cities
service
come
in
contact
with
the
gas
we're
talking
about
at
the
wellhead,
isn't
it?
did
it
have
anything
to
do
with
this
gas
before
the
wellhead?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
well
that
it
turns
up
and
it
wants
the
gas
that's
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
can
it
get
that
gas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
can
i
get
it
any
other
way
except
having
somebody
who
has
control
and
hand
it
over
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
it's
handed
over
to
the
cities
service
because
that's
the
11
cents,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
has
to
do
so
because
the
commission
has
ordered
it
that
it
can't
get
it
for
less.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
attribute
but
cities
service
has
to
pay
that
11
cents
because
kansas
has
attributed
11
cents
worth
to
that
gas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
can't
get
it
less
than
11
cents
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
anybody,
can
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
whatever
is
--
whatever
gas
is
involved
that's
between
cities
service
and
the
seller
is
gas
at
the
wellhead
after
all
the
physical
transactions
are
completed
and
he
can
get
that
gas
only
if
he
can
turn
over
11
cents,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
gas
when
it
goes
over
the
cities
services
by
ordinary
customer
channeled
going
in
and
outside
of
kansas,
is
that
correct
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
that
transaction,
right
there
at
the
wellhead
is
what
cities
services
is
here
about
and
what
kansas
says
you
can't
get
--
put
on
it
any
other
phase
of
transaction
or
monetary
relationship
except
if
you
want
it,
you've
got
to
pay
at
least
11
cents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tells
magnolia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
can't
sell
it
the
cities
service
less
than
11
cents,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
fact,
it
sells
it
to
a
person
who
as
a
matter
of
vast
range
of
business
as
interstate
outlet
for
the
gas
he's
getting,
is
that
correct
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
enjoin
it
from
violating
this
order,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
are
you
really
--
the
colloquy
between
you
and
me
get
down
to
this
that
kansas
has
done
nothing
to
cities
service,
doesn't
know
cities
service,
doesn't
care
about
cities
service,
but
magnolia
--
and
magnolia
is
free
not
to
tell
to
anybody
to
oblige,
is
that
right?
as
far
as
this
order
is
concerned,
magnolia
didn't
sell
to
anybody,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
magnolia
--
but
if
it
sell,
it
sell
--
it
must
sell
at
11
--
for
11
cents
or
attribute
11
cents,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
kansas
doesn't
know
the
existence
of
cities
service,
is
that
right?
therefore,
cities
service
is
not
involved.
magnolia
is
free
as
a
bird.
therefore,
nothing
has
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
does
that
mean
--
are
you
implying
that
if
you
can
show,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
kansas
has
done
here
may
demonstrably
be
a
force
or
a
pressure
influence
in
the
direction
of
avoiding
waste
that
to
that
extent,
the
phillips
case
is
to
be
qualified?
in
other
words,
if
assuming
that
the
order
does
in
fact
fixed
price
of
wellhead
of
gas
going
in
interstate
commerce
and
therefore,
beyond
the
power
of
state
agency
under
the
phillips
related
case,
yet
in
those
cases,
it
wasn't
argued
that
although
it
does
so,
wasn't
decided.
it
also
--
the
state
regulation
would
have
some
influence
upon
conservation
that
that's
a
qualification
to
the
doctrine
laid
down,
the
phillips
case.is
that
what
you're
going
to
argue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
your
commission
and
your
court
had
said,
“we
do
not
battle
over
language,
this
is
the
fixing
of
price
at
the
wellhead,
was
stopped
that
goes
into
interstate
commerce,
but
although
it
is
such
a
fixing
of
the
price,
it
does
also
have
or
indeed
the
justification
for
it
so
far
as
kansas'
concern
is
that
it
have
the
restraining
influence
upon
waste.suppose
your
supreme
court
had
said
that,
you'd
still
be
defending
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
then.
the
question
whether
it's
an
attribution
of
value
of
price
is
just
word?
i
don't
mind
words.
that's
the
only
thing
we've
got
to
deal
within
this
realm,
but
they're
empty
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
if
you
say
you
would
defend
it
if
it
is
a
price
fixing
order,
then
if
i
may
suggest,
you
got
to
argue
on
that
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
are
you
--
why
are
you
so
confident
that
prior
to
1938,
kansas
would
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
price
of
the
wellhead
of
stuff
coming
in
into
interstate
commerce
and
(inaudible)
why
are
you
so
confident
in
setting
that
kansas
would
have
this
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
what
was
done
here,
the
wald
case
is
a
totally
different
case.
that
was
a
case
where
our
natural
resource
--
i
forgot
what
the
case
--
wyoming
or
somewhere
out
west.

a
natural
resource,
limited
resources
of
a
state
were
being
used
in
a
--
in
a
economically
wasteful
in
the
largest
in
economic.
the
wasteful
way,
namely,
the
manufacture
of
(inaudible)
and
the
state
said,
“you
can't
--
you
can't
use
this
natural
resource
of
a
state
in
that
kind
of
a
destructive
way.”
now,
we
haven't
got
a
case
where
kansas
said,
“nobody
can
take
natural
gas
out
of
theory
in
the
first
place”
and
the
question
whether
it
could
permit
it
all
together.
nobody
could
take
it
out
except
for
its
most
productive
use
that
is
in
this
case.
justice

but
this
--
it
may
have
this
consequence,
the
things
that
are
--
everything
is
related
to
everything
else
in
this
world,
almost,
more
or
less
direct
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
specific
fixing
of
price
for
a
fellow
who's
going
to
use
it
in
interstate
commerce
or
if
you'll
prefer,
i'll
take
your
place,
an
attribution
of
value,
if
you
like
that
phrase
better,
it's
three
long
words
for
one
short
on
price.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
stuff
could
never
come
to
the
surface,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
also
--
could
you
also
take
into
account
my
desire
to
know
whether
in
your
view,
the
power
commission,
the
federal
power
commission,
has
power
to
fix
the
price
or
the
value
of
attribution,
fixing
what
they
would
call
price
--
what
do
you
call
attribution
of
value,
at
the
rate
in
which
(inaudible).
would
the
federal
power
commission
have
that
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
included
in
chief
justice's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
that
the
whole
case
here,
the
question
whether
or
not
the
federal
power
act
has
supplanted
the
power
of
kansas,
assuming
kansas
had
such
power.
now,
for
purposes
of
(voice
overlap)
i
assume
that
it
has,
though
i
think
it
would
--
would
admirably
be
questionable
whether
under
the
act
or
follow
the
decision,
it
didn't
have
that
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
the
federal
power
commission
couldn't
do,
but
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
write
the
opinion?
