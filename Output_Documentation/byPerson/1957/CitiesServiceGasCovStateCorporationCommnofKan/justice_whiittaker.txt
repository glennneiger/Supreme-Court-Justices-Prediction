mr.
justice
whiittaker
well,
that's
not
what
this
court
have
found
(inaudible)
it
hadn't
been
--
you
see,
that's
a
proration
order.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
and
limiting
the
amount
that
may
be
taken
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
comes
at
a
time
before
it
could
be
commerce.
of
course
when
i
use
the
word
commerce,
i'm
speaking
in
the
sense
of
the
commerce
clause,
which
means
interstate
commerce.
in
your
situation
here
now,
i'm
very
interested.
suppose
it's
true
that
for
conservation
purposes,
this
is
a
means
of
accomplishing
the
desired
end.
does
it
not
also
though
in
your
situation
fix
the
price
of
gas
in
the
challenge
of
commerce
and
i
had
you
therefore,
not
the
--
to
conflicting
principles,
you
therefore
wouldn't
be
able
would
you
to
control
the
price
of
gas
once
in
commerce
even
though
it
had
this
effect
of
conserving
the
gas
in
preventing
waste.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
i
guess
it's
more
of
a
lecture
than
a
question.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
does
price
have
anything
to
do
with
it
all?
isn't
it
just
a
question
of
power
and
now
you
got
to
get
down
to
phillips
and
the
panoma
case?
isn't
--
aren't
they
the
cases
that
this
court
has
already
settled
on
and
you've
got
to
show
a
distinction
where
you
can
have
a
different
result?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
as
a
matter
fact,
you
do
not
have
a
severance
tax
on
gas.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
do
you
have?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
and
who's
it
paid
by?
the
severance
tax
is
paid
by
the
--
mr.
justice
whiittaker
--
lease
--
mr.
justice
whiittaker
well,
couldn't
you
do
that
by
criminal
actions?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
or
may
prevent
it?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
but
in
using
it,
you
--
you
attempt
to
assert,
it
seems
to
me
now,
a
state
power
that
has
been
vested
in
the
federal
power
commission
once
you
admit
that
the
gas
from
the
well
goes
immediately
into
an
interstate
pipeline.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
and
the
sales
that
you
mentioned
(inaudible)
eight
and
a
half
percent
are
not
made
by
the
producers
but
come
out
of
this
interstate
pipeline,
apparently,
and
are
made
by
city
service
to
local
industries
in
the
state,
isn't
that
right?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
and
that's
all
in
commerce.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
sir?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
by
other
power
to
regulate
commerce.
and
you
admit
this
gas
goes
into
commerce
then
you
admit
it
seems
to
me
the
basis
of
the
government's
case.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
well,
the
natural
gas
act
rest
--
rest
on
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
commerce
clause.
mr.
justice
whiittaker
created
in
this
case?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
how
differently
from
phillips
and
panoma?
didn't
they
--
did
--
didn't
they
settle
the
same
question?
mr.
justice
whiittaker
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
whiittaker
i
think
that's
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
whiittaker
(inaudible)
