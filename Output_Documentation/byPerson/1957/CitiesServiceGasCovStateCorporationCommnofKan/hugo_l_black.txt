is
it

most
of
it
around
eight

as

justice

that's
what
you

--
contracts
out
so
far
or
is
that
what
you've
paid
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
kansas
supreme
court
say
about
this
sentence
and
now
to
the
fact,
phillips
petroleum
here
where
we
said
rather
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
the
congressional
intent
to
give
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
of
all
wholesale
of
natural
gas
in
the
interstate
commerce
whether
by
pipeline
company
or
not
and
whether
appeared
before,
during
or
after
transmission
by
interstate
pipeline.
what
did
they
say
about
that
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
they
explain
that?
what
is
the
argument
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was,
was
it
not
a
sale
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
a
resale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
goes
to
which
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
commission
hasn't
held
that
yet,
has
it?
they
wanted
to
raise
the
price
of
kansas
but
not
in
--
for
kansas
consumers
but
not
for
out
of
state
consumers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
other
cases
except
the
ones
you'd
cited?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
they
cover
your
case
pretty
well.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
your
standpoint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
state
attack
the
state
supreme
court
finding
that
this
was
in
commerce
and
was
sold
by
resale
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
been
in
dispute
up
today?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
it
--
could
it
by
recognizing
your
way
with
the
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
$4
million
increase?
justice
hugo
l.
black
over
what
period
of
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it?
did
it
have
to
grant
the

justice
hugo

black
did
it
grant
an
increase
--
did
grant
an
increase
to
that
hearing
to
determine
whether
it
was
fair
and
reasonable
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
the
wholesaler
as
i
suppose
that
doesn't
involve
it,
maybe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
problem
is
one
that
has
involved
the
consumers,
ultimate
consumers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
bond
provided
that
when
the

justice

black
does
it

does
it
fix
the
price
of
gas
at
the
wellhead
which
is
far
shipment
in
the
interstate
commerce
as
your
state
supreme
court
said?
justice
hugo

what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what's
the
effect
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
require
them
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
require
them
to
do
with
reference
to
its
sale?
justice

l.
black
what
is
the
requirement
to
sell
it
at
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
include
gas
that's
to
be
sold
in
interstate

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
gas
that's
to
be
sold
in
interstate

such
as
that
the

service
bought?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
include
that
gas
that
the
cities
service
bought?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
considerable.
that's
not
an
overstatement
say
the
least
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
could
--
how
could
they
explain
it
at
all
if
it's
contributed
unless
they
actually
gotten
the
sentence
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
sell
that
for
less
than
11
cents
and
called
it
an
attribution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
cities
service
buy
gas
in
kansas
after
this
order
--
orders
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
legally
without
paying
11
cents.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
one
that
gets
it.
how
could
it
buy
for
less
than
11
cents
legally
under
this
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
magnolia
buy
or
sells
it
for
less
than
that,
what
can
it
be
done
to
--
under
kansas
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it's
a
valid
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
sanction
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
sanction
does
your
law
provide
for
one
who
violates
an
order
of
your
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
criminal
provision
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
--
is
it
a
violation
of
your
criminal
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
act
which
attempts
to
say
that
the
states
are
not
levy
of
such
severance
tax.
there
is
an
expressed
provision
in
the
federal
act
that
gives
the
federal
government
exclusive
power
to
regulate
sale,
the
interstate
deprives
of
sales
in
interstate
commerce.
now
if
--
so
what
you're
arguing
here
that
although
it
referred
to
sales
that
if
you
say
this
is
not
under
the
name
of
conservation;
that
gives
you
the
right
to
regulate
the
price
in
effect
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
severance
tax
based
on
the
value
of
the
gas
(inaudible)
has
no
effort
made
to
deprive
the
state
of
using
that
field
to
--
if
it
thinks
it
will
conserve
it,
it
conserve
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
think
--
we
--
we
said
in
those
two
cases
that
--
that
we've
held
carefully
the
act's
meaning,
the
state
--
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
federal
power
to
regulate
price
of
sale.
anything
about
the
--
the
purpose
for
which
a
state
may
act
or
anything
else
and
how
can
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
state
wants
to
regulate
the
price
of
sale
that
the
government
has
exclusive
power
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
or
for
something
else?
what
difference
does
that
make?
if
the
government's
taken
over
the
power,
why
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
we
had
determined
that
in
the
two
cases
before.
we
didn't
say
anything
about
argument
of
conservation,
the
right
to
do
it
or
the
means
of
conservation
may
hove
not
been
major
(inaudible)
but
what
difference
does
it
make
if
federal
government
has
exclusive
power
to
fix
the
price
whether
the
state
tries
to
fix
it
for
one
purpose
or
another,
can
it
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
want
us
to
overrule
phillips
and
the
other
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
court
has
found
in
the
precise
words
of
the
federal
act
that
this
was
done
fixing
a
price
of
this
--
this
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
but
it
was
read
here
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
hadn't
found
it
--
it's
a
fact
isn't
it
that
this
was
for
sale
in
interstate
commerce
or
resale
in
interstate
commerce
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
not
here
about
what
the
fact
is
--
the
fact
is
the
order
of
the
kansas
state
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
doesn't
say
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
denying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
denying
the
fact
that
that's
its
effect
and
its
purpose,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
they
said
was
behind
it
why
they
wanted
to
do
it.
its
purpose
was
to
raise
the
price.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
intended
to
raise
it
when
--
when
the
interstate
commerce
didn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
willing
to
say
that
your
statute
applies
only
in
intrastate
transaction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
in
that
case
you've
said
that
the
reason
they
will
fix
the
price
was
to
--
to
--
conservation
purposes.
it'd
been
just
where
you
are
(inaudible)

justice

one
of
the

its
invocation
of
its
power
to
conserve

justice

by
using
as
a
means
of
fixing
the
price
of
gas,
which
is
going
into
interstate
commerce.
