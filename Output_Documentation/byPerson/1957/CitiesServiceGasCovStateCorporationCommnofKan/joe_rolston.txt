mr.
joe
rolston
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
taken
by
appellant,
cities
service
gas
company,
to
reverse
the
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
the
judgment
of
that
court
sustained
as
valid,
a
gas
price
fixing
order
issued
by
the
corporation
commission
of
kansas,
fixing
a
minimum
prize
of
11
cents
per
mcf
on
a
14.65
pressure
base
as
applied
to
sales
of
gas
made
in
the
kansas
portion
of
the
hugoton
field
to
appellant
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
these
sales
were
wellhead
sales
made
by
producers
in
the
field
to
appellant
under
long-term
contracts
which
were
substantially
lower
than
the
price
fixed
by
the
kansas
order.
there
were
also
sales
in
the
interstate
commerce
made
by
producers
after
the
producer
had
completed
gathering
the
gas,
producing
and
gathering
gas
and
sold
it
at
the
end
of
gathering
in
the
field
to
the
appellant,
cities
service
gas
company.
mr.
joe
rolston
sales
at
the
wellhead
and
those
made
at
the
end
of
gathering
in
the
field.
the
question
before
this
court,
as
stated
by
the
appellant
is
just
one
single
jurisdictional
problem.
that
question
is
can
a
state
in
the
exercise
of
this
gas
conservation
powers
lawfully
fix
a
minimum
price
for
natural
gas
sold
in
interstate
commerce
resell
in
phase
of
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
giving
the
federal
power
commission
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
governing
such
sales.
mr.
joe
rolston
we
do
not,
your
honor,
and
we
regret
very
much
that
we
can't
read
the
kansas
supreme
court
decision
as
the
appellees
have
done.
and
i
shall
discuss
that
matter
more
in
detail.
mr.
joe
rolston
we
don't.
mr.
joe
rolston
insofar
as
fixing
the
price
is
concerned,
as
to
sales
in
interstate
commerce
resale,
we
do.
mr.
joe
rolston
well
--
mr.
joe
rolston
if
you
include
price
in
it,
that's
the
--
we're
making
no
contention,
your
honor
or
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we're
making
no
contention
in
this
case
that
in
the
absence
of
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act.
a
state
cannot
constitutionally
fix
the
minimum
price
for
the
natural
gas.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
held
that
and
that
cities
service
gas
company
against
peerless
oil
&
gas
company
and
phillips
petroleum
company
against
state
corporation
commission
and
that
we're
not
questioning
that.
mr.
joe
rolston
we're
not
conceding
though,
your
honor,
that
it's
necessary
to
fix
the
price
in
order
to
conserve
gas
under
the
statute's
conservation,
statutes
of
kansas
or
oklahoma
or
any
other
states.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
the
only
question
that
we
have
before
this
court.
but
we
do
not
want
to
be
construe
their
saying
that
we
think
it's
necessary
to
fix
price
in
order
to
conserve
gas.
there's
adequate
machinery
under
the
many
state
enactments
governing
that
phase
of
conservation
which
we
think
are
adequate.
before
discussing
the
--
the
material
portion,
the
order
involved
in
this
lawsuit,
i
think
maybe
it
would
be
helpful
for
this
court
to
know
that
this
price
fixing
feature
is
--
is
nothing
new
back
in
1947.
the
state
of
oklahoma
fixed
a
seven-cent
price
for
gas
produced
and
sold
in
the
oklahoma
portion
of
the
hugoton
field.
in
1948
after
the
oklahoma
procedure
had
taken
place,
the
kansas
commission
fixed
an
eight-cent
price
for
natural
gas
produce
and
sold
in
the
kansas
portion
of
the
hugoton
field.
then
in
1952,
the
oklahoma
commission
each
within
new
order
in
which
they
fixed
the
price
at
9.8262.
then
in
1954,
effective
january
1st,
1954,
the
kansas
commission
issued
this
order,
fixing
11-cent
price
and
changing
the
pressure
base
which
constitutes
approximately
a
12-cent
price
with
the
change
in
the
pressure
base.
now,
i
want
to
quote
a
small
portion
of
the
--
of
the
order
that's
under
consideration
because
it
to
me
is
self-explanatory
and
i
think
directly
answers
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question.
here's
what
they
say,
it's
on
page
45
of
the
record,
the
order
says
this
that
all
persons,
firms
or
corporations
which
take
gas
or
cost
a
gas
to
be
taken
from
hugoton
gas
field
in
kansas
on
and
after
january
1st,
1954,
12:01
a.m.
shall
as
a
condition
present
or
withdraw
from
the
common
source
of
supply
pay
or
attribute
to
all
gas
taken,
except
gas
for
the
operation
of
leases
for
all
purposes
including
payments
to
producers,
landowners,
lease
owners
and
royalty
owners
the
fair
and
the
reasonable
minimum
price
of
not
less
than
11
cents
per
mcf,
14.65
pounds
psi
at
the
wellhead
until
a
further
order
of
this
commission.
now,
the
portion
of
the
order
that
answers
the
question
is
that
says
--
part
which
says
for
all
purposes
including
payments
to
producers.
now,
it
starts
out
that
all
persons,
firms
or
corporations
which
take
or
cost
gas
to
be
taken.
we
certainly
take
gas
from
the
field
because
we
have
a
pipeline
in
the
field.
and
if
the
court
will
turn
to
exhibit
34
at
page
79
of
the
record,
the
court
will
find
set
for
a
complete
map
of
the
pipeline
system
of
cities
service
gas
company
showing
its
gas
fields
from
which
it
takes
its
gas
or
purchase
its
gas
and
it
shows
the
vast
hugoton
field
there
and
the
panhandle
field
in
texas
and
some
other
fields
in
oklahoma
and
kansas.
the
court
will
observe
that
this
hugoton
gas
field
which
the
commission
has
said
and
i
think
we
can
agree
as
the
largest
gas
field
in
the
world,
lies
on
three
states,
kansas,
oklahoma
and
texas.
now,
as
i
made
the
point
at
the
start,
we
are
not
contesting
or
claiming.
the
state
does
not
have
any
power
to
fix
a
minimum
price
for
natural
gas
produced
and
sold
in
interstate
commerce
as
against
constitutional
objections.
but
when
you
bring
in
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act,
which
this
court
considered
in
the
case
of
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
v.
panoma
corporation
and
some
other
cases
in
a
per
curiam
opinion,
349
u.s.
44
and
phillips
petroleum
company
v.
state
of
wisconsin
et
al.
in
347
u.s.
672.
it
is
our
contention
than
as
to
any
sale
of
gas
made
in
any
--
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
that
this
court
has
held
by
the
phillips
case
and
the
panoma
case
and
as
reinforced
by
the
plain
language
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
in
section
1
(b)
says
that
the
act
shall
apply
to
the
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale
and
the
natural
gas
company
is
engaged
in
such
sale.
now
--
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas,
when
you
read
their
opinion,
you're
going
to
find
and
they
say
a
lot
of
things
and
we
weren't
sure
what
they
really
did
say.
but
on
one
portion
of
the
case
--
mr.
joe
rolston
no,
no,
no.
the
kansas
court
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
that
portion
of
it.
the
--
on
--
well
--
and
we
have
set
the
opinion
out
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
on
page
7
or
8,
here
is
what
the
kansas
court
said
with
respect
to
our
operations.
they
say,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
during
all
dates
in
question,
the
gas
company,
that's
--
that's
the
appellant,
cities
service
gas
company,
a
natural
gas
company
as
defined
in
the
natural
gas
act,
in
its
operations
in
the
purchase
of
gas
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field,
purchased
gas
from
the
producers,
delivered
at
the
wellhead,
also
delivered
at
its
pipeline
in
the
field
after
the
production
and
gathering
had
entered.
mr.
joe
rolston
page
8
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
that
was
an
error.
it
had
no
production
in
the
field
and
purchased
therein
all
gas
obtained
of
the
gas
so
purchased
during
the
year
1951,
55.4%
was
purchased
of
the
wellhead
and
44
point
--
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
on
page
9
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
i'm
reading
now
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joe
rolston
appendix.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
correct,
55.4
%
was
purchased
at
the
wellhead
and
44.16%
pipeline
delivered
in
the
field
after
production
and
gathering
had
been
completed.
now,
here's
what
the
court
said
with
respect
to
the
interstate
operation,
from
one
has
been
heretofore
stated
--
mr.
joe
rolston
my
--
the
appellant's
jurisdictional
statement,
roman
--
page
9
--
8
and
9
of
the
appendix,
appendix
a.
mr.
joe
rolston
8
and
9
of
appellant's
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes.
i'd
better
get
the
record.
i
think
that's
better.
mr.
joe
rolston
97
of
the
record
and
with
respect
to
our
interstate
operations,
here's
what
this
court
said
and
the
record
bears
it
out
and
there
is
no
conflict,
no
contradiction
about
facts
in
this
case.
from
what
has
been
heretofore
stated,
it
appears
that
the
sales
of
gas
made
by
producers
in
the
field
to
the
gas
company
in
the
first
instance
after
production
and
gathering
had
entered
and
in
the
second
after
production
--
in
the
first
after
production
had
ceased
and
in
the
second
after
production
and
gathering
had
entered
where
sales
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
or
resale
for
ultimate
public
consumption
for
domestic,
commercial,
industrial
or
other
uses.
it
also
appears
in
such
record
that
after
such
sales
had
been
completed
the
gas
company
placed
such
gas
in
its
interstate
integrated
pipeline
system
and
thereafter
made
resale
thereof
to
at
least
of
some
of
the
appellant
cities.
now,
there
was
involved
in
this
litigation
in
the
lower
court
some
kansas
municipalities
which
were
also
attacking
the
validity
order
on
the
same
grounds
in
which
we
were.
but
the
cities
have
not
sought
a
review
in
this
court.
now,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
awhile
ago,
i
believe
it
was
and
maybe
it
was
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
kansas
court
did,
they
said
on
page
98
of
the
opinion,
they
construe
this
price
order.
mr.
joe
rolston
ninety-eight
of
the
record.
i'm
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
stay
with
the
record
now,
your
honor.
the
parties
are
far
apart
on
their
construction
of
the
commission's
order.
on
the
one
hand,
the
appellants
contend
such
order
as
a
price
fixing
order
having
application
to
sales
of
natural
gas
made
by
producers
after
its
production
and
gathering
has
entered.
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission
contend,
it
is
purely
a
conservation
measure
limited
to
production
of
gas
from
the
common
source
of
supply
before
sensation
of
production
which
makes
the
minimum
attribution
price
therein
prescribed,
a
condition
precedent
to
the
withdrawal
of
any
natural
gas
whatsoever
from
such
source.
we
are
not
inclined
with
the
labor
arguments
made
by
the
parties
respecting
the
construction
to
be
given
the
order.
it
suffices
to
say
that
after
a
careful
analysis
thereof,
we
have
no
difficulty
in
construing
its
terms
to
me
that
no
person,
firm
or
corporation,
first
of
all,
the
producers
and
left
or
take
gas
in
its
natural
state
from
the
depths
of
the
hugoton
field
to
a
point
further
than
the
wellhead
without
as
a
condition
precedent
to
its
withdrawal
from
the
common
source
of
supply
first
attributing
thereto
a
minimum
price
of
not
less
than
11
cents
per
mcf,
14.65
pounds
psi,
so
construed
recognizing
as
we
must
that
under
our
own
decisions.
now,
right
there,
they
cite
kansas
nebraska
natural
gas
company
be
the
corporation
commission
which
that
court
had
upheld
and
sustained
an
eight-cent
price
order.
the
--
the
order
in
the
two
cases
is
exactly
the
same
except
as
to
price
and
the
court
said
so
in
its
opinion.
now,
in
the
kansas-nebraska
case
that
case
was
never
appealed
to
this
court
or
a
review
was
never
sought.
and
the
kansas
court
said
that
that
was
the
fixed
law
of
kansas.
now,
in
the
kansas-nebraska
case,
the
companies
--
pipeline
companies'
involved
taking
gas
from
the
field,
took
the
gas
in
one
or
two
ways
by
production,
their
own
production
or
by
purchase.
in
our
case
here,
it's
solely
by
purchase.
we
do
not
produce
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
now,
the
court
said
in
the
kansas-nebraska
case
that
they
have
the
power
to
fix
that
deal
price.
then
they
came
along
in
the
columbia
fuel,
the
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
company,
a
case
in
176
kansas.
it
was
decided
just
a
few
years
after
that.
and
in
that
case,
they
held
that
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
company
under
that
eight-cent
order
was
required
to
pay
the
producer
not
only
the
eight
cents
fixed
by
the
price
order
at
the
wellhead,
but
also
in
addition
thereto
the
cost
of
gathering
the
gas
and
the
contract
provided
that
the
producer
should
pay
the
cost
of
gathering.
that
is
the
sale
under
the
contract
was
made
at
the
end
of
production
and
gathering
in
the
field.
now,
there's
many
question
but
what
there
is
a
substantial
disagreement
between
the
appellees
and
the
appellants
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
--
what
the
kansas
court
decided.
i
think
probably
that
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
court
decided
was
that
the
company,
after
the
court's
opinion
was
handed
down
and
then
accordance
with
this
rules,
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing.
and
in
this
motion
for
rehearing,
we
specifically
asked
the
kansas
court
to
clarify
its
judgment
and
decision.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes
and
i
--
i
might
say
--
mr.
joe
rolston
i
am
familiar
with
the
--
mr.
joe
rolston
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
whittaker
but
the
court
doesn't
always
follow
it.
there
are
several
statutes
in
kansas
will
say
the
very
thing
you
said.
and
as
a
matter
a
fact,
the
syllabus
in
this
case
shows
that
they're
basing
their
decision
in
the
case
here
under
consideration
on
what
they
decided
in
the
kansas-nebraska
case.
and
in
the
kansas-nebraska
case,
they
decided
that
the
purchaser
had
to
pay
the
producer
and
the
producer
couldn't
sell
to
the
purchaser
unless
he
received
the
eight
cents
and
that's
the
same
--
mr.
joe
rolston
well
--
mr.
joe
rolston
forty-five?
mr.
joe
rolston
are
you
--
are
you
referring
now
to
the
commission's
memorandum
opinion?
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
the
order
there
is
what
i
read
awhile
ago
--
mr.
joe
rolston
--
that
all
persons,
firms
and
corporations
so
that
is
not
--
they
say
that's
based
on
the
statute.
but
there
isn't
any
statute
in
kansas
that
--
and
i'm
sure
they
can
cite
it
on
that
says
the
fixed
price
of
gas.
mr.
joe
rolston
well
--
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
that's
one
thing
(voice
overlap).
mr.
justice
whittaker
that's
one
thing
that
bother
us
and
that's
the
reason
we
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
in
which
i
was
just
about
--
mr.
joe
rolston
--
to
get
into
when
you
asked
the
question.
now,
we
--
we
couldn't
understand
clearly,
we
didn't
know
whether
we
were
required
to
pay
or
just
say
we
attribute
this
or
attribute
that
in
a
matter
of
bookkeeping,
we
could
--
we
couldn't
tell
that
so
we
--
we
asked
the
court
to
clarify
its
opinion
and
we
just
told
the
court
in
our
motion
for
rehearing.
and
here
are
the
words
we
used.
it's
short
and
right
to
the
point.
unless
this
court
grants
the
appellant
a
rehearing
in
this
case
and
upon
such
rehearing
or
otherwise
answers
the
federal
questions
presented
and
clarifies
and
determines
the
applicability
of
said
minimum
price
order
as
applied
to
the
undisputed
operations
of
appellant
in
its
purchase
of
the
natural
gas
in
said
field,
then
appellant
is
forced
to
and
will
assume,
this
court
has
decided
that
said
minimum
price
order
of
the
commission
does
apply
to
the
undisputed
operations
of
appellant
and
appellant
is
required
to
pay
the
producer
as
a
condition
precedent
to
its
taking
and
purchasing
of
the
gas,
the
minimum
price
fixed
by
said
order
regardless
of
whether
such
sales
of
gas
to
it
in
interstate
commerce
resale
or
made
at
the
wellhead
after
production
has
ceased
or
in
the
field
after
production
and
gathering
has
entered.
and
that
court
denied
our
motion
for
rehearing
without
opinion.
so
when
you
read
the
case
of
columbia
fuel
against
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
company,
they
plainly
said
in
that
case
when
dealing
with
the
said
order
that
--
that
panhandle,
the
pipeline
company
was
required
to
pay
columbian
fuel
they
produce.
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
i
--
i
--
you
mean
now
or
then?
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
it
was
higher
than
some
prices.
it
was
higher
than
some
or
contract
prices
and
--
yes,
i
would
say
it
was
higher.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
right.
there
isn't
any
tax
matter
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes,
we
have.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes,
that's
actually
right,
your
honor.
we
had
contracts
--
our
exhibit
30
--
35
shows
that
we
--
mr.
joe
rolston
what?
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
page
80
of
the
record.
that
shows
that
we
buy
gas
from
stanolind
gas
company
which
is
now
pan-american
petroleum
corporation,
magnolia
petroleum
company,
united
producing
company,
columbia
fuel,
western
natural
gas,
(inaudible)
texas
company
and
columbia.
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
i
remember
one
in
particular
--
our
contract
with
magnolia
is
6
cents.
and
i
think
our
contract
with
stan
is
eight
point
something.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
the
sale
--
that's
the
sale
price.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
the
sale
price
at
that
time.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
right.
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
you
see,
to
answer
that
that
--
that
is
the
price
fixed
by
the
previous
kansas
order
that
was
8
cents.
mr.
joe
rolston
that
is
our
contract
with
magnolia
with
6
cents.
mr.
joe
rolston
that
what?
mr.
joe
rolston
no,
we
pay
--
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
the
--
the
exhibit
here
was
based
on
the
--
on
the
record
and
the
situation
as
it
existed
at
the
time.
and
at
the
time
this
new
price
order
of
11
cents
was
made,
there
had
been
a
previous
kansas
price
order
which
fixed
the
minimum
price
to
8
cents
which
had
then
appealed
to
kansas
supreme
court
and
sustained
that
no
appeal
taken
further.
so
we
had
been
complying
with
that
8-cent
order
and
that's
what
the
rate
there
is.
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
--
mr.
joe
rolston
they
(voice
overlap)
--
they
distinguished
the
--
the
panoma
case,
the
phillips
case
by
--
by
saying
that
this
was
production
and
gathering
and
it
came
within
the
exemption
provisions
of
section
1
(b),
because
it
was
a
part
of
production
and
gathering.
mr.
joe
rolston
and
then
they
also
--
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
they
also
said
your
honor,
at
another
page
in
the
opinion
that
--
and
explained
in
the
--
the
panoma
case.
here,
as
we
have
indicated,
the
kansas
commission
--
that's
page
101
of
the
record,
the
kansas
commission
has
fixed
the
minimum
price
to
be
paid
for
gas
before
cessation
of
production.
this
fact
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
distinguish
the
decision
on
which
appellants
rely
and
warrants
our
conclusion
that
they
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
controlling
prices.
now,
when
you
said
--
when
this
court
said
in
the
phillips
case
and
what's
your
--
your
honor
just
referred
to,
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
answer.
it
makes
any
difference
where
the
sale
occurred
as
long
as
it
sale
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
and
that's
what
the
circuit
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
in
the
deepsouth
case
which
is
attached
as
--
as
an
appendix
on
these
briefs
and
also
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
southern
case
which
is
just
recently
handed
down
and
as
--
as
an
appendix
to
the
fpcs
amicus
curiae
brief.
mr.
joe
rolston
no,
i
--
i
didn't
say
that.
i
--
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
rolston
that
all
the
gas
that
we
purchased
goes
in
into
our
interstate
pipeline
system.
and
the
record
shows
that
it's
commingled
with
gas
from
three
other
common
sources
of
supply,
some
in
kansas,
some
in
oklahoma
and
some
in
texas.
now,
the
--
the
commingled
gas
according
to
one
of
our
witnesses
and
that
wasn't
disputed.
he
--
he
said
you
couldn't
identify
the
gas
to
mark
it
in
of
the
pipeline.
but
he
estimated
that
48%
of
the
kansas
gas
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
was
sold
intrastate
and
the
balance
of
it
was
sold
outside
the
state.
mr.
joe
rolston
no,
we
get
31%
of
our
total
gas
supplies
from
this
kansas
portion
of
the
hugoton
field
and
--
and
most
all
or
--
or
substantial
part,
most
all
of
our
gas,
well
i'd
say
half
of
it
estimating,
comes
from
the
kansas
hugoton
and
oklahoma
portion
of
the
hugoton
field.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
48%,
that's
merely
an
estimate,
48%
of
the
gas
because
its
commingled
gas
and
we
can't
identify
it,
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
it's
only
an
estimate
of
the
witness.
when
the
gas
is
taken
and
commingled
from
these
different
sources
of
supply,
there's
no
way
in
the
world
to
identify
which
gas
comes
from
which
field.
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
right.
mr.
joe
rolston
the
only
answer
i
can
make
to
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
there
is
some
of
this
gas
sold
and
offers
the
pipe
--
interstate
pipeline
that
comes
from
the
kansas
--
portion
of
hugoton
field
in
kansas.
there
is
some.
it
isn't
a
large
amount
to
get.
mr.
joe
rolston
no,
no,
they're
--
they
are
saying
that
this
is
a
conservation
measure.
mr.
joe
rolston
no,
there
--
there
--
mr.
joe
rolston
there
--
there
--
if
that
was
correct
and
--
and
the
court
has
held,
we
wouldn't
be
up
here
because
it
wouldn't
affect
that
hardly
[laughs]
but
they
--
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
the
--
the
--
you
see,
you've
got
these
price
orders.
you
had
them
up
in
the
panoma
case
and
--
and
there's
no
difference
in
any
of
them.
there
is
no
difference
in
the
price
order
in
this
case
and
the
panoma
case
except
the
price.
and
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
appellees
in
this
case,
we
asked
them
to
tell
us
whether
we
are
required
to
pay
this
price
before
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
and
they
didn't
tell
us.
and
i
--
and
i
think
they
ought
to
tell
this
court
whether
or
not
the
producer
is
--
is
required
to
get
--
this
gas
goes
in
the
interstate
commerce
price.
mr.
joe
rolston
well,
i
don't
know
as
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes.
mr.
joe
rolston
we
operate
our
own
--
mr.
joe
rolston
yes.
mr.
joe
rolston
yes.
now,
wait
just
a
minute.
any
gas
under
the
decisions
i
read
in
this
court,
(inaudible)
walker
miller
company
owned
them
that
if
the
gas
is
destined
for
outstate
consumption
that
is
the
substantial
portion.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
about
the
intrastate
state.
there
is
the
decision
i
think
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joe
rolston
they
--
they
said
nothing
in
their
briefs.
i
heard
them
say
nothing
in
their
oral
arguments
and
the
court
said
nothing
in
its
opinions.
mr.
joe
rolston
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
joe
rolston
we
--
we
think
--
mr.
joe
rolston
that's
right.
and
--
and
we
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
kansas
court's
opinion
is
that
they
require
their
propriety
and
they
require
to
produce
here
to
be
(inaudible).
now,
if
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
should
say,
“you're
not
hurt
and
you
know
we
don't
care,”
but
they
wouldn't
tell
us.
and
when
you
examine
their
other
opinions
in
connection
with
this
one,
there
isn't
any
question
what
in
my
mind
of
what
they
have
said
that
we're
required
to
pay
and
it
applies
to
these
sales
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale.
thank
you.
