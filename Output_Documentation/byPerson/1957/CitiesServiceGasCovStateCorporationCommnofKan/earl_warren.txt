those
sales
are
involved
in
this
case
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
reading
from
--
are
you
reading
from
page
8
of
your
appendix?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
with
magnolia,
you
paid
6
--
chief
justice
earl

and
sold
it
for
8?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
sold
it
for
eight.
i
thought
you
said
you
paid
6
and
sold
it
for
8.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
paid
it
--
if
you
bought
it
for
6,
why
isn't
--
doesn't
it
say
6
here
instead
of
8?

mr.

chief

is
that
just
for
this
one
company
or
--
chief

earl
warren
there
are
others?
chief

mr.

chief
justice

finish
that
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stucky
--
mr.
stucky,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
question
here
is
whether
the
state
of
kansas
has
the
power
to
do
this,
not
whether
it
was
desirable,
not
whether
these
people
have
made
some
--
done
some
wrongful
things,
but
it's
a
question
whether
the
state
of
kansas
vis-Ã -vis
the
--
the
federal
government
has
the
right
to
--
to
do
it.
now,
that's
the
thing
that
we're
really
interested
in
and
not
--
we
can
get
the
--
we
can
get
the
history
and
--
and
the
violations
along,
so
forth,
from
--
from
your
briefs,
but
on
the
oral
argument,
we
would
like
to
hear
the
legal
question
discussed
as
to
power
and
how
your
friend
--
and
particularly,
how
--
how
you
would
explain
the
phillips
decision
and
the
broad
language
that
is
in
that
decision.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
stucky,
though
those
things
are
--
are
true.
if
you
don't
have
the
power
to
fix
prices
on
interstate
commerce,
are
they
relevant?
do
they
make
any
difference?
isn't
you
--
why
don't
you
limit
yourself
to
the
legal
argument
as
to
whether
your
state
has
that
right
to
fix
prices,
unless
cast
a
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce.
now,
why
don't
you
--
why
don't
you
stay
with
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
--
i
thought
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
it
didn't
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
we
call
it
fixing
prices
or
whether
it
was
attribution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
don't
you
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
it
is
price
fixing
and
we
--
we
won't
hold
it
against
you
if
we
come
to
conclusion
that
it
isn't
price
fixing
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
why
don't
you
discuss
that
legal.
i'm
sure
the
court
would
like
to
hear
that
in
preference
with
these
other
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
theis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
theis,
mr.
stucky
went
into
that
rather
thoroughly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
think
he's
made
his
point
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
severance
tax
in
this
--
in
this
case
mr.(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
of
phillips
where
it
says
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
a
congressional
intent
to
give
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
of
all
wholesales
of
natural
gas
and
interstate
commerce
whether
by
a
pipeline
company
or
not
and
whether
occurring
before,
during
or
after
transmission
by
an
interstate
pipeline
company.
what
do
you
do
with
that
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
would
have
a
--
repudiate
that
language
in
phillips
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
