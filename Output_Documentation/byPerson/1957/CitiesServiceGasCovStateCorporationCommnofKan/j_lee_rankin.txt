mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
power
commission
is
here
asking
that
this
decision
be
reversed
and
the
court
hold
that
the
order
is
invalid.
as
far
as
we
can
find
in
the
case,
there
is
no
issue
that
the
state
of
kansas
has
any
right
to
regulate
by
an
order
of
this
type
because
this
is
gas
moving
only
intrastate.
it's
the
question
of
whether
because
it
is
a
conservation
measure
they
have
the
right
to
regulate
the
price
of
the
gas
under
the
exemption
of
section
1
(b)
in
regard
to
production
and
gathering.
it
is
just
that
simple.
now,
we
have
been
troubled
with
the
statement
that
this
attributes
a
price
rather
than
requires
the
payment
of
the
price,
but
the
order
doesn't
limit
to
attribute
but
requires
payment
or
attribution.
but
if
you'll
watch
the
order
closely,
you
will
note
that
the
kansas
court,
in
interpreting
the
order
and
the
order
itself,
provides
that
the
payment
shall
be
made
if
it
passes
the
wellhead.
it
doesn't
say
that
this
is
a
charge
for
bringing
this
gas
up
to
the
wellhead
and
no
farther.
but
if
it
passes
the
wellhead
which
gets
it
into
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
then
there
is
an
attribution
or
payment
to
be
made.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
could
mean,
you
just
mark
it
up
on
your
books
and
nobody
paying
more
attention
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
they
have
--
that's
the
way
it's
been
worked
and
magnolia
filed
a
filing
before
the
federal
power
commission
in
which
they
did
include
it
in
the
price
that
they
asked
this
--
this
particular
appellant
to
pay
for
the
gas
and
the
appellant
proceeded
to
ask
the
federal
power
commission
or
make
a
filing
saying
that
it
was
entitled
to
an
increase
because
of
that.
so
we
find
that
by
that
kind
of
--
of
a
measure
and
the
practical
application
by
the
parties
which
i
think
is
impossible
to
avoid.
we
get
down
to
place
where
the
poor
consumer
down
at
end
doesn't
get
much
benefit
from
the
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
and
the
importance
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
kansas
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
one
way
of
trying
to
get
away
from
panoma
and
phillips
that
you
can
claim
that
there
is
an
attribution
and
yet
there's
not
a
sale.
but
the
parties
proceed
to
say,
“you've
got
to
pay
for
the
gas
on
this
basis.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
if
the
government
can
require
that,
the
effect
of
it
is
to
make
the
payment.
and
in
effect,
it
changes
the
price
structure
and
immediately
has
already
had
that
effect.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
conservation
measure,
that
is
what
is
to
be
called
and
that's
the
only
way
that
it
could
be
given
any
validity
at
all,
would
be
to
lift
the
price
and
the
whole
--
all
of
the
records
shows
that
in
order
to
have
some
effect
on
purchases
at
the
end
with
the
idea
that
if
we
lift
the
prices
up
then
it
will
get
certain
uses
of
gas
out
of
the
market
for
this
particular
gas.
now,
it
isn't
any
kind
of
a
conservation
order
at
all
if
somebody
doesn't
have
to
pay
it
because
nobody
will
notice
any
effect
of
it.
but
the
moment
you
put
--
make
somebody
pay
it,
the
man
down
the
line
that's
use
--
using
it
for
what
they
consider
uneconomic
use
or
one
that
this
gas
shouldn't
be
used
for
because
coal
or
oil
or
some
other
fuels
should
be
used
then
he'll
look
it
over
and
he'll
say,
“well
that
cost
me
too
much.”
not
somebody
attributes
something
so
i
don't
have
to
pay
it,
so
what's
the
difference.
but
he'll
say,
“it
cost
me
too
much
for
this
use
and
i'll
quit
using
it.”
that's
the
whole
theory
of
the
whole
record
but
you
can't
deal
with
panoma
and
phillips
as
easily
if
you
use
it
as
frankly
and
openly
as
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
wouldn't,
no.
they
are
doing
that
very
thing.
there's
unitization
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
want
to
make
that
clear
as
--
as
far
as
the
federal
power
commission
is
concerned
in
the
government
brief
by
attorneys
general
of
a
number
of
the
states
had
been
filed
here
saying
that,
“we
are
trying
to
extend
this
act
on
behalf
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
we
are
claiming
that
the
states
have
no
power
to
regulate
and
we're
intruding
on
that
because
of
the
statement
that
we
used
that
there'll
be
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
if
you
recall,
that's
the
exact
language
of
the
court
used
in
phillips
when
it
said
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
by
reason
of
this
--
the
price
of
these
sales
and
so
we
used
that
same
language.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
clear.
there
wasn't
any
purpose
or
intention.
there
isn't
any
purpose
or
intention
on
the
--
on
the
part
of
federal
power
commission
or
the
government
to
interfere
with
proper
measures
of
conservation
that
the
states
are
to
regulate.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
they
have
that
power
but
they
can't
handle
conservation
by
regulating
price
because
the
moment
they
do,
they
come
in
to
headlong
conflict
with
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
as
--
that's
what
bother
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
bothered
me
about
answering
a
question
categorically
that
they
could,
as
long
as
it's
a
regulation
in
degree.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
question
of
what
and
a
reasonably
--
reasonable
regulation
that
they
can
have
conservation
in
that
manner.
the
thing
that
bothered
me
was
whether
the
question
included
not
allowing
any
gas
to
be
transferred
in
the
interstate
commerce
and
then
i
think
we
have
to
have
a
reservation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there's
a
possibility
and
probability
that
they
could
do
that
but
they
do
even
more
than
that.
they
prohibit
the
wasting
of
the
gas
as
a
conservation
measure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
see
how
there'd
be
any
commerce
involved
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
so
we
wouldn't
have
any
problem
of
interference
or
clash
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
that
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
but
(voice
overlap)
--
that
isn't
what
the
order
provides.
it
doesn't
say
you
can
bring
it
up
to
the
--
to
the
wellhead
and
you
have
to
pay
anything.
it
says,
“if
you
bring
it
beyond,”
and
there
you
got
the
commerce.
now,
we
also
do
not
claim
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
this
court
has
held
that
where
there's
the
sale
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
wholesale
for
interstate
commerce
and
there's
transmission,
there
is
a
commingling
that
you
cannot
separate
and
that
that
gas
is
on
its
movement
at
least
when
it
leaves
the
wellhead.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
mean
price
regulation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
congress
has
said
that
the
interstate
sales
or
wholesale
are
regulated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
is
commingled
when
it
leaves
the
wellhead.
there
isn't
any
question
under
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
when
it
leaves
the
wellhead
here,
it
is
commingled
with
gas
that's
sold
in
interstate
commerce
and
in
such
a
manner
that
it
can't
be
possibly
be
separated
by
any
man.
he
cannot
distinguish
what
part
of
the
gas
would
go
in
the
intrastate
commerce
and
which
will
go
in
interstate
commerce.
so,
they're
trying
to
reach,
not
the
production
of
this
gas
up
to
the
wellhead
in
which
case,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
any
of
these
producers
whether
you
attribute
it
or
what
you
--
what
--
what
kind
of
a
price
you
put
on.
but
it's
that
transfer
beyond
the
wellhead
that
they
are
trying
to
fix
the
price
on
and
it's
that
point
at
which
it
--
interstate
commerce
is
subject
to
the
control
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
federal
power
commission,
that's
our
position.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
find
anything
for
that
character
in
the
issues
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
now,
we
also
want
to
make
clear
that
we
do
not
contend
that
the
states
do
not
have
a
proper
area
of
action
as
to
reasonable
taxation,
severance
tax
and
so
forth.
it's
asserted
that
we
--
we
may
be
moving
and
try
to
take
that
from
them.
and
of
course,
we
recognized
that
the
natural
gas
act
expressly
had
in
mind
that
and
as
long
as
it
comes
within
the
requirements
of
the
calvert
case.
we've
seen
no
difficulty
about
those
taxes
and
we're
not
contending
that
they
are
not
properly
entitled
to.
now,
in
examining
exhibits
35
and
36
on
pages
80
and
81,
it's
very
interesting
to
note
by
those
exhibits
just
who's
being
affected
by
this
kind
of
an
order.
what
--
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
raising
this
price
up
at
the
wellhead
or
after
the
production
and
gathering
had
been
completed.
both
are
involved
in
this
case.
there
are
major
gas
companies.
they
are
not
just
a
lot
of
little
producers,
stanolind
oil
&
gas
company
for
26
million
thousand
cubic
feet.
there
is
a
small
lot
of
jointly
own
wells
there,
204,471.
then
we
get
down
to
magnolia
petroleum
company,
one
of
the
majors,
united
producing
company,
columbian
fuel
corporation,
western
natural
gas,
carbon
texas
company
and
columbia,
all
substantial
operators
in
the
field
that
are
going
to
be
benefited
by
this
kind
of
an
operation
of
price
fixing.
now,
it's
suggested
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
recognized
these
rates
and
therefore
has
no
right
to
object
this
time.
i
want
to
tell
the
court
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
could
not.
but
furthermore,
it
--
it
has
not
and
it
has
tried
not
to.
i'll
put
it
that
way
and
try
to
describe
what
has
happened.
as
you
know
the
act
provides
for
filings
and
these
three
and
half
years
since
phillips,
they
have
been
engulfed
with
filings
by
different
producers
over
the
country,
some
19,000
better
than
19,000
different
filings.
now,
the
act
doesn't
say
just
because
a
man
or
producer
files
a
paper
in
which
he
describes
a
certain
rate
which
they
were
directed
to
do
under
the
federal
power
commission's
order
174
that
that
--
the
filing
of
it
makes
the
federal
power
commission's
failure
to
do
anything
at
that
point
an
approval
of
it.
the
federal
power
commission
must
act
within
30
days
under
section
4,
if
it
wants
to
suspend
it.
it
can
come
in
under
section
5
(a)
at
anytime
and
examine
into
the
rate
and
it
can
--
and
that
mere
filing
doesn't
involve
any
affirmative
action
by
the
federal
power
commission.
on
this
situation,
there
were
two
cases
that
i
want
to
briefly
describe
to
the
court.
one
is
the
magnolia
case
in
which
there
was
an
application
as
described
in
the
footnote
to
our
brief
for
--
of
price-wise
because
of
this
kansas
order
and
there
was
also
the
application
of
cities
service.
when
that
application
was
first
filed,
it
included
the
contract
between
the
parties
and
the
minimal
price
order
and
also
the
agreement
that
cities
service
have
made
whereby
the
producers
that
got
this
higher
price
because
of
this
minimum
price
order
would
have
to
refund
it
to
cities
service
if
it
was
later
declared
illegal.
and
the
commission
first
made
it
subject
to
that
provision
and
then
later,
they
eliminated
that
part.
the
explanation
i
was
given
by
the
federal
power
commission
was
that
the
elimination
of
it
being
subject
to
this
provision
of
refund,
if
the
courts
would
hold
it
illegal,
was
to
not
interfere
with
the
court
action
and
the
court
determination
as
to
what
the
effect
of
this
minimum
price
order
would
be
and
that
case
is
not
final.
it's
now
on
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
so
that
the
court
can
determine
what
the
legal
effect
of
this
minimum
price
order
is
in
regard
to
these
contracts.
now,
we're
talking
about
a
sum
of
$4
million
increase
on
the
price
of
gas
in
this
very
case
so
that
it
is
a
--
a
very
substantial
sum.
and
you
and
i
know
that
it
isn't
going
to
be
paid
down
the
bottom
of
the
line
to
the
producer
without
coming
out
the
end
here
from
the
consumer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
the
amount
that's
involved,
the
total
amount
that's
involved
between
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
one
year,
between
the
contracts
and
the
minimum
price.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
one
company.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
are
others
and
there
are
a
great
number.
and
i
was
trying
to
find
out
what
the
effect
of
this
might
be,
this
minimum
price
order
on
whole
gas
industry.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
it
reaches
then
to
almost
every
pipeline
that
supplies
important
areas
in
this
country.
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
there's
the
commingling
--
practically
every
pipeline
has
some
of
its
production
gas
comes
from
that
area.
and
then
it
gets
some
from
oklahoma
and
texas
and
other
areas
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
are
already
busy
at
it.
oklahoma
has
raised
it
once
at
least
during
this
procedure
of
getting
through
the
courts.
and
i
understand
there's
one
at
texas
but
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
now,
the
magnolia
case
is
before
the
courts
and
there
was
the
dorchester
case
in
which
the
federal
power
commission,
it's
a
small
producer
had
this
question
of
and
in
fixing
the
difference
--
the
amount
that
they
would
have
to
provide
a
bond
for
in
a
small
company.
they
took
the
difference
between
the
minimum
price
for
the
(inaudible)
and
the
basic
contract
orders.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
federal
power
commission
if
they're
going
to
have
to
examine
the
whole
question
and
take
into
account
mobile
and
its
effect
on
this
matter
if
the
court
should
--
should
decide
that
this
minimum
price
order
is
illegal
because
under
mobile,
they
would
have
no
power
without
a
5
(a)
hearing
to
step
in
and
just
change
the
price
that
would
have
to
be
paid
to
these
producers
in
the
face
of
their
contract.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
13
different
pipeline
companies
operating
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
the
commission
now
has
5
(a)
proceeding
count
in
which
this
very
question
is
involved
as
to
whether
or
not
the
minimum
price
order
can
be
taken
into
account
or
has
to
be
taken
into
account
as
the
floor
that
the
commission
has
to
deal
with
for
these
people
or
these
pipelines
to
pay
for
gas
or
where
they
--
they
can
examine
into
their
contracts,
disregard
the
price
order
as
illegal
and
determine
what
they
would
have
to
pay
under
those
contracts
and
that
thereby
fix
the
price.
and
they
also
have
for
stanolind
the
four
--
section
4
proceeding,
so
that's
before
them
now
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
would
--
that's
what
is
in
the
5
(a)
proceedings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
also
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
its
contention
that
it
has
a
right
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
to
fix
the
rate
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
at
the
wellhead
and
under
panoma
and
other
cases.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
in
this
particular
--
in
this
particular
case,
cities
service
was
given
the
increase
rate
based
upon
the
minimum
price
order
contingent
upon
its
agreement
to
a
refund
if
the
price
order
was
held
to
be
illegal.
now,
that
refund,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
is
only
as
to
the
jurisdiction
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
the
power
to
regulate
which
is
the
interstate
commerce
area.
of
course
the
other
commissions
could
make
the
same
condition
or
provision
if
they
saw
fit
as
to
the
intrastate
--
excuse
me,
and
the
exempt
area
and
all
the
industrial
and
so
forth.
so
that
as
to
that
area
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
require
refund,
there
is
an
agreed
provision
in
the
order
that
cities
service
will
have
refund.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
difficult
because
there
--
you
have
the
distributors
down
the
line
and
whether
or
not
the
states
will
make
the
distribution
companies,
give
it
back
to
the
consumers
or
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
at
least
the
commission
did
went
as
far
as
it
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
a
question
of
whether
they
can
get
along
and
pay
it
or
probably
leave
with
the
kansas
people
and
get
the
gas.
i
assumed
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
there
was
an
independent
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
fair
and
reasonable.
it
was
based
upon
the
assumption
that
if
this
order
was
valid,
they
were
entitle
to
it
and
if
was
not,
they'd
have
to
refund
it.
that
was
as
simple
as
that
i
think.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
would
have
to
refund
it
to
the
--
the
various
transmission
lines.
and
then
whether
the
ultimate
consumer
really
got
it
would
depend
upon
the
regulation
of
the
distributors
which
is
not
under
the
federal
power
commission's
control.
we
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
might
explain
to
the
court.
they
have
departed
from
requiring
bonds
because
they
had,
i
think
that's
about
1950,
required
bonds
of
10%
and
the
bonds
were
clearly
so
small
relatively
compared
to
the
amount
that
have
to
be
refunded
that
it
wasn't
accomplishing
anything
but
it
was
running
cost
for
bond
premiums
of
insubstantial
sums
or
if
the
company
had
a
state
that
justifies
they're
being
able
to
pay
within
the
contemplated
period.
they're
not
--
they
don't
require
bond.
but
there
are
companies
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
--
there
isn't
any
money
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
can't
answer
that.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
see
--
as
long
as
you
assumed
it's
reasonable
to
any
problem
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
have
to
find
the
stage
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
see
any
problem
on
that
as
long
as
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
the
wellhead.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
from
that
point
on,
it
is
a
continuous
flow
to
the
consumer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
an
entirely
different
theory.
