then.
justice
charles

whittaker
who

is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rolston,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
again.
but
may
i
have
a
little
bit
of
(inaudible)
did
you
tell
justice
black
just
now
that
all
gas
you
purchased
is
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
all
the
gas
from
this
field?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
tell
me
whether
i
misunderstood
you
as
i
talked
to
you
erroneously
from
my
looking
at
the
(inaudible)
in
1951,
55%
and
47%
of
the
gas
you
purchase
in
the
hugoton
field
were
purchased
to
wellhead.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
44%
and
67%
is
purchased
after
production
and
gathering.
and
that
the
total
51.5%
is
sold
in
commerce
so
the
rest
is
sold
in
the
state
of
kansas.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
state
of
kansas
is
making
no
question
about
the
fact
that
part
of
the
gas
is
sold
locally
in
kansas.
they
--
they
attack
it
--
the
whole
of
the
sale
--
all
the
gas
on
the
same
basis,
namely,
that
they
have
a
power
in
conservation
to
regulate
the
price
at
the
wellhead
and
before
you
get
it,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
--
who
does
the
mixing
of
this
gas?
you
do
it,
do
you
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
your
own
line.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
was
a
time
when
at
the
wellhead
when
it
wasn't
commingled
with
other
gas
destined
for
commerce,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
kansas
making
any
contention
that
to
that
effect
here
that
there
should
be
--
that
your
attempt
to
hereby
mixing
the
gas
in
your
pipelines
with
other
gas
and
some
of
it
sold
by
you
for
local
use
in
kansas,
do
they
claim
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
wouldn't
it
be
possible
out
in
that
hugoton
field
for
people,
owners
of
leases
or
owners
of
--
landlord's
interest
in
leases
to
waste
the
gas
just
--
you've
seen
it
bearing
yourself
out
there.
now,
wouldn't
the
--
the
state
of
kansas
have
power
you
say,
you
want
to
waste
it,
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
11
cents,
a
thousand
for
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
when
commerce
is
not
involved.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
could
--
are
they
limited
to
doing
that
in
one
way?
could
they
not
also
fortify
that
by
requiring
the
payment
of
money
if
you
do?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
it
wouldn't
be
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
does
--
but
--
that's
just
the
point.
is
commerce
involved
when
the
gas
is
two
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
still
in
the
pipes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
in
commerce?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now
have
you.
you
bring
it
one
foot
beyond
the
valve,
within
your
own
pipes
and
then
send
it
on
and
off
to
your
own
factory
which
is
located
half
a
mile
away,
is
commerce
involved?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
commerce.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
sure.
all
whole
--
for
example,
all
wholesales
of
natural
gas,
phillips
case
now,
in
interstate
commerce
whether
by
pipeline
company
or
not
and
whether
occurring
before,
during
or
after
transmission
by
an
interstate
pipeline
company,
of
course
is
in
commerce.
but
is
the
principle
different
than
commingling
wheat
that
you
own
and
i
own
and
i
tortuously
commingle
it.
and
then
i
sell
it
in
--
in
commerce
until
that's
--
am
i
then
able
to
say
that
is
all
to
be
regulated
as
--
by
federal
power
to
the
exclusion
of
the
states?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yours
but
--
have
you
got
an
interstate
sale
until
at
least
it's
been
commingled
in
interstate
pipes.

charles

(inaudible)

now
then,
do
you
know
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
happens
with
respect
to
gas
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
at
the
wellhead.
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
that's
the
point
then
i
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
just
the
contrary,
don't
you?
that
the
sales
of
gas
made
after
production
and
gathering
has
ended
to
an
interstate
carrier
would
of
course
be
in
commerce,
wouldn't
it?
