mr.

m.
stucky
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
are
in
basic
disagreement
about
the
nature
of
this
order
which
was
not
made
in
a
vacuum
but
which
was
made
after
long
hearings
which
described
a
situation
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
perhaps
the
degree
of
basic
difference
is
revealed
by
counsel's
failure
to
point
out
the
most
significant
language
in
this
lower
court's
decision.
on
page
101
of
the
opinion
are
found
these
words,
finally
appellants,
and
that's
the
appellant
here,
contend
at
the
trial
court
in
rendering
its
judgments
determined
the
price
order
in
question
applied
to
the
operations
of
the
gas
company.
we
do
not
agree
resort
to
its
judgment
heretofore
quoted,
discloses
that
all
it
did
was
uphold
and
sustain
the
order
of
the
commission
and
the
curtailing
production
in
the
hugoton
field
and
based
on
the
premise,
the
commission
was
not
fixing
a
price
for
gas
in
the
field
that
prescribing
a
minimum
price
for
all
gas
that
the
wellhead
as
a
condition
precedent
for
withdrawals
from
the
common
source
of
supply
in
the
interest
of
conservation.
now,
we
have
an
extensive
record
in
this
case
which
shows
why
such
an
order
was
entered
in
the
state
of
kansas.
as
to
the
nature
of
the
order,
it
has
been
interpreted
and
construed
as
a
conservation
order,
the
corporation
commission
of
kansas
has
said
in
a
formal
proceeding
interpreting
this
order
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
operations
of
the
cities
service
gas
company.
it
is
refused
to
hold
cities
service
or
require
cities
service
to
make
any
payment
to
landowners
under
this
order.
the
order
regulates
severance
and
enters
the
conservation
and
the
protection
of
correlative
rights.
we
take
the
position
that
it
regulates
the
creation
of
a
commodity.
it's
a
regulation
of
real
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
ohio
oil
company
against
indiana.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
do
not
agree
with
you
that
the
supreme
court
said
that.
i
think
it
fixes
a
minimum
price.
it
uses
a
word
fix
the
price
at
the
wellhead.
but
i
do
not
agree
that
it's
an
order
fixing
the
price
in
the
nature
of
a
raise
order.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it's
a
conservation
order
which
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
the
effect
of
it
is
this.
it
requires
that
every
person
who
reaches
into
the
depths
of
hugoton
field
2400
to
2700
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
only
those
persons
are
persons
who
take
gas
in
the
field
within
the
meaning
of
the
order
as
the
commission
has
construed
it.
it
aggresses
itself
to
those
person
who
takes
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
requires
them
to
treat
this
gas
as
though
it
were
a
--
the
precious
commodity
it
is.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
requires
them
to
treat
it
with
reference
to
its
sale
and
all
of
its
subsequent
activities
with
respect
to
that
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
requires
them
to
attribute
the
price
or
a
value
of
at
least
11
cents
to
treat
it
as
though
it
will
work
something.
and
the
state
of
kansas
says
if
it
does
not
treat
it
as
though
it
will
work
at
least
11
cents
that
the
gas
will
be
dissipated
and
the
record
is
full
of
instances,
would
show
how
these
orders
have
operated
in
the
past.
it
is
a
regulation
of
end
use
of
gas,
the
same
as
the
(inaudible)
case
that
this
court
decided
some
years
ago.
the
same
as
the
thompson
case,
except
that
it
does
not
point
to
a
particular
end
use,
a
particular
covert
plant
operation.
it
is
an
impartial
regulator
of
use.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
includes
all
gas
indiscriminately.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
--
it
includes
production
of
all
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
--
it
is
the
regulation
of
the
production
of
all
gas
in
the
hugoton
field
whether
later
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
think
so,
yes.
i
don't
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
second
full
paragraph
on
page
97.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
from
what
is
heretofore
been
stated?
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
in
that
--
in
that
case,
the
kansas
supreme
court
is
talking
about
the
sales
of
gas
which
are
made
by
appellant
and
it
--
it
later
states
that
this
order
does
not
apply
to
those
sales
nor
do
any
other
sales
of
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
yes,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
i
think
that
--
the
--
whether
they
are
made
after
the
production
and
gathering
have
ended
or
whether
they're
made
at
the
wellhead
they're
made
in
interstate
commerce.
we
are
not
relying
on
that
1
(b)
exemption
as
the
solicitor
general
indicates.
we
are
relying
upon
a
concurrent
part
which
was
possessed
by
the
states
prior
to
1938
and
which
was
not
within
the
primary
grant
of
the
natural
gas
act.
this
is
not
a
rate
case.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no,
we
don't
have
to
overrule
phillips.
what
we
have
to
do
your
honor
--
well,
i
hope
to
be
able
to
do
is
to
take
us
back
in
1938
and
see
whether
an
order
such
as
this,
what
have
been
a
valid
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
state
to
conserve
the
gas
prior
to
1938
whether
there
was
--
whether
this
court
had
ever
said
that
the
state
couldn't
exercise
such
a
power.
and
if
we
find
any
cases
back
there
which
would
strike
down
such
state
action,
then
it
might
be
within
the
gap
that
was
intended
to
be
filled
by
the
natural
gas
act.
but
our
examination
of
the
cases
beginning
with
ohio
oil
company
against
indiana
reveals
that
this
is
an
area
within
which
the
power
of
the
state
has
not
been
questioned
and
had
not
been
questioned
in
1938
when
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no,
you
honor.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
we
do
not
assert
a
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
we
do
not
claim
to
fix
a
minimum
price
of
gas
in
commerce.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
we
claim
that
this
order
has
the
same
effect
and
is
a
conservation
and
regulation
of
production
measure.
it
is
--
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
panoma
case
is
the
same
difference
--
is
the
same
situation.
it's
a
difference
between
the
calvert
case
and
the
hope
natural
gas
company
case
against
hall.
in
the
hope
natural
gas
company
case
against
hall,
west
virginia
imposed
a
severance
tax
based
on
a
value
of
gas
at
the
wellhead.
in
the
calvert
case
decided
several
terms
ago
by
this
court
in
the
same
session
that
phillips
was
decided.
texas
had
imposed
a
tax
against
the
first
taking
of
gas.
but
this
court
pointed
out,
the
incidents
of
the
tax
had
been
delayed
until
production
and
gathering
had
ended.
and
distinguished
to
calvert
case
and
the
post
case
and
the
other
severance
tax
cases
involving
coal
in
pennsylvania
or
in
minnesota
on
the
grounds
that
the
incidents
of
the
tax
had
been
delayed
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
and
in
this
case,
the
kansas
court
has
not
permitted
the
incidents
of
the
--
of
the
impact
of
the
order
to
be
delayed
until
production
and
gathering
has
been
completed
but
placed
--
regulated
the
--
regulated
the
production
itself.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
it
--
it
has
not
aggressed
into
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
it
doesn't
address
itself
to
the
buyer.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
the
--
the
kansas
commission
construing
this
order
in
an
interpretative
proceeding.
the
word
pay
has
reference
to
the
one-eighth
royalty
owners
because
when
they
--
when
they
reach
into
the
ground
and
take
the
gas,
this
leads
to
provide
they
must
to
pay
a
fair
and
reasonable
value
for
it
and
when
the
word
pay
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
correct.
if
you
used
it
yourself,
you
must
show
that
you
are
--
you've
used
it
in
such
a
way
that
it's
consistent
with
the
value
of
11
cents.
now,
if
you
settle
it
at
wellhead,
i
would
think
you
would
have
some
difficulty
establishing
that
you
attributed
the
price
of
11
cents
to
it
unless
you
got
11
cents
at
the
wellhead
for
the
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
i
--
i
--
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
same
thing.
it's
not
the
same
thing
which
is
the
reason
i
phrased
it
the
way
i
did
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
some
of
these
gases
--
some
of
the
gases
are
solid
residue
gas
which
was
true
in
panoma.
panoma
didn't
deal
with
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
would
depend
on
what
the
residue
gas
there
--
there
--
if
they
would
receive
other
--
that's
just
part
of
a
gas,
residue
gas
of
the
liquefiable
hydrocarbon,
the
butanes,
the
propane,
the
natural
gasoline,
the
income
from
that.
they
would
--
the
nature
of
this
proceeding
would
be
a
--
a
proceeding
to
--
for
them
to
establish
whether
or
not
they
actually
have
pleaded
this
gas
as
though
it
was
worth
11
cents
and
it
would
involve
all
of
their
revenues.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
you
mean
in
a
kansas
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
i
would
say
--
i
would
put
it
this
way.
how
could
magnolia
produce
it
unless
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
at
the
wellhead?
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
they
don't
--
they're
not
required
to
attribute
a
nickel
to
it,
the
cities
service.
it's
the
producers.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
if
--
if
that
was
--
if
they
were
buying
whole
gas
at
the
wellhead,
its
producer
could
not
produce
it,
unless
it
was
getting
as
you
say
11
cents
for
it.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
if
it
wanted
the
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
there's
no
argument
about
the
impact
of
this
order.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
know.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
yes
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
unless
you
would
argue
about
whether
price
meant
value
there,
i
think
that's
what
it
means.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
sir?
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
think
it
means
that
--
that
it
has
a
fair
and
reasonable
value
of
what
--
11
cents
at
the
wellhead.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
the
commission
has
interpreted
this
order
and
the
supreme
court
has
interpret
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
can
purchase
it
from
the
producer.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
--
state
action
requires
the
seller
to
attribute
the
value
to
it.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
the
seller
can
--
can
sell
it
to
somebody
else
from
more
11
cents.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no,
that's
right.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
after
cities
service
purchases
the
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
if
kansas
does
not
tell
that
to
cities
service.
kansas
tells
magnolia.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
if
that's
all
you're
going
to
do
with
it
is
sell
it
to
cities
service
for
11
--
for
less
than
11
cents
you
can't
produce
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
if
it
sells
it
to
the
cities
service,
it
sells
it
to
such
a
person.
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well
it
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
the
order
says
that
they
shall
not
take
it
out.
so
it
would
be
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
--
from
taking
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
i
--
there
are
some
single
provisions
i
suppose
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
for
violation
of
an
order?
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
the
way
the
kansas
commission
has
entered
in
this
case
is
by
so
cost.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no,
no,
i'm
sure
that's
true.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
--
let's
say
corporation
commission
of
kansas.
the
obvious
method
of
enforcing
this
order
was
to
--
would
be
to
prevent
them
from
taking
the
gas
out
of
the
field.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
certainly.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
as
far
as
the
order
is
concerned
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
--
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
i
--
i
think
you
over
simplify
and
overstate
my
position
there.
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
order
was
made
to
correct
the
continued
monopolistic
practices
of
the
few
pipeline
companies
out
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
and
it
was
designed
to
correct
correlative
rights
out
there
and
that
the
price
of
gas
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
and
the
--
the
conditions
under
which
gas
is
produced
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
resulted
from
economic
conditions
peculiar
to
that
field
where
a
large
number
of
small
producers
and
landowners
were
facing
drainage
by
reason
of
the
monopolistic
practices
of
the
pipelines.
the
--
there
was
a
destructive
competition
among
the
small
producers
in
trying
to
secure
these
pipeline
connections.
and
gas
became
a
distress
commodity
and
it
was
treated
as
a
value
--
a
virtually
valueless
commodity.
it
was
blown
in
to
air.
it
was
--
the
wells
were
--
after
the
completion
of
the
wells,
they
were
--
they
were
blown
for
completion
purposes
carbon
black
plants
sprang
up
in
the
area,
manufacturing
suit
and
using
only
about
92
or
9%
or
10%
of
the
energy
of
the
gas.
in
--
in
short,
a
particle
use
and
waste
of
this
irreplaceable
natural
resource
came
into
being.
and
the
evidence
show
that
--
that
there
was
a
real
relationship
between
treating
this
gas
as
a
valueless
or
virtually
valueless
commodity
and
these
wastes.
the
record
shows
how
this
happened.
there
were
various
wildcatters
and
the
independents
who
first
discovered
the
field.
there
were
just
a
few
pipelines
in
the
area.
it
wasn't
economically
feasible
to
market
this
gas
or
to
build
a
pipeline
to
market
gas
even
from
the
largest
wells
or
the
10
largest
wells
in
the
field.
you
can't
carry
gas
in
the
bucket
like
cooking
oil.
you
can't
transport
it
from
the
truck.
you
can't
put
it
on
a
rail.
there's
only
one
way
to
get
it
there
and
that's
through
pipelines.
and
these
pipelines
constituted
monopolies
out
there
and
the
small
independents
and
the
producers
were
captive
suppliers.
and
they
fought
for
connections
and
they
lost
some
leases
trying
to
get
connections.
it
cost
about
$25
to
$30
million
to
build
a
pipeline.
and
these
pipeline
companies,
instead
of
giving
the
connections,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
instead
of
giving
them
connections,
it
would
buy
a
lease
right
next
to
their
leases
and
they
drain
their
gas
up
from
under
them.
and
so
these
independent
producers,
they
wouldn't
buy
their
gas.
they
refuse
to
buy
their
gas.
well,
i'll
have
to
continue
this
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
--
in
the
morning.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
this
morning
by
examining
the
record
to
point
out
some
of
the
evils
and
abuses
in
economic
problems
that
existed
that
made
necessary
this
order.
now,
the
history
of
the
field
is
recounted
in
some
detail
in
this
record.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
portion
of
the
record
on
--
from
pages
357
to
360,
and
again
from
364
to
396.
now,
there
are
some
30
or
40
pages
there
of
record
which
tell
about
the
experiences
of
the
small
independent
producers
and
land
owners
in
the
field
and
i'd
like
just
--
to
briefly
explain
to
the
court
what
the
situation
was
during
that
period
of
time.
and
most
of
what
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
yes.
i
might
--
if
i
may
explain
why,
i
thought
these
facts
might
be
helpful
to
the
court.
we
--
we
point
out
that
this
order
was
necessary
and
proper
as
a
conservation
order
and
to
protect
correlative
rights.
now,
really,
that
is
admitted
in
the
record
but
judge
rolston
came
here
and
said,
“we
don't
admit
that
this
was
necessary
for
--
for
conservation,”
although
it
is
admitted
to
the
record.
and
the
solicitor
general
has
come
here
and
told
this
court
that
any
proper
conservation
measure,
the
federal
power
commission
would
not
object
to.
so
i
thought
that
if
we
would
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
this
order
was
necessary
to
conserve
gas
in
kansas
and
was
proper
to
protect
correlative
rights,
and
if
i
could
describe
the
economic
circumstances
which
made
it
necessary
and
imperative.
the
fixed
price,
life
of
lease
contracts
and
the
distress
commodity
created
by
the
pipeline
monopolies
and
the
destructive
competition
that
i
could
overcome
the
inference
that
this
was
some
kind
of
a
--
an
attempt
to
impose
state
power
in
some
area
where
the
federal
government
had
supreme
power.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no.
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i'm
going
to
argue
that.
i
--
we
think
the
phillips
case
does
not
apply
here.
i
was
--
i
was
about
to
recap
these
facts
also.
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it.
you
can
call
this
a
price-fixing
case
if
you
want
to
or
you
can
--
i
--
as
i
prefer
to
call
it
a
value
attribution
case.
what
is
the
important
is
to
see
how
the
order
operates
and
its
purpose
and
what
it
was
designed
to
do
and
how
the
8-cent
order
did
what
this
was
designed
to
do.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
work
on
two
grounds.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
i
had
hoped
i
could
convince
you
otherwise,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
all
right.
i
will.
you
ask
me
about
the
phillips
case.
the
phillips
case
has
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
regulate
the
price
of
gas
after
production
and
gathering
has
been
completed.
now,
the
first
distinction
is,
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
for
rate
making
purposes.
we
take
the
position
that
this
has
--
that
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
for
rate
making
purposes.
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction,
its
rate
making
jurisdiction
was
intended
to
fill
a
gap,
which
existed
prior
to
1938
and
the
state
have
the
power
that
we're
talking
about
prior
to
1938.
and
we
examined
cases
prior
to
1938
and
we
discussed
them
in
our
briefs
and
i
want
particular
to
point
out
--
to
--
to
your
honors
attention,
the
green
brief
in
reply
to
the
federal
power
commission.
in
1938,
the
state
was
doing
this
sort
of
thing
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
--
that
this
--
that
the
natural
gas
act
did
not
deprive
the
state's
other
rights,
of
any
rights
which
it
had
prior
to
1938.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
we
--
that
the
federal
power
commission
in
acting
in
its
rate
making
capacity,
and
the
kansas
corporation
commission
are
not
rivals
in
the
same
field
of
endeavor.
ratemaking
now
at
the
wellhead
in
kansas
is
--
is
the
prices
are
fixed
by
pipeline
monopolies.
the
federal
power
commission
contends
it
has
ratemaking
jurisdiction
in
kansas.
indeed
it
would
like
to
have
us
treat
this
case
as
though
it
were
the
case
is
up
here
on
certiorari,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
the
right
to
fix
the
wellhead
price
and
push
--
and
push
--
and
push
phillips
back
to
the
wellhead,
but
that's
not
this
case.
we're
talking
about
the
--
the
concurrent
power
which
existed
in
the
states
prior
to
1938,
to
conserve
gas
and
protect
correlative
rights,
and
the
record
shows
that
this
is
the
only
way
that
these
matters
can
be
handled
because
of
the
peculiar
conditions
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i'm
confident
of
that
because
i
examined
the
oil
and
gas
cases.
ohio
against
indiana
which
regulated
the
use
--
an
end
use
of
gas,
it
was
an
end
use
regulation
of
gas
if
you
analyze
the
case.
the
wald
case,
the
wyoming
case
where
they
said
you
can't
take
gas
out
and
use
it
for
carbon
black
plants
under
certain
circumstances,
an
end
use
of
gas.
the
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
wyoming.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
say
it
is.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
may
i
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
may
i
--
may
i
tell
you
what
the
record
shows
about
the
8-cent
price?
when
the
8-cent
order
went
into
effect,
we
had
a
lot
of
carbon
black
plants
out
there
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
now,
the
commission
could've
singled
out
this
channel
iron
plant
and
that
channel
iron
plant
and
that
channel
iron
plant,
and
said,
“you
shut
down
because
you're
engaging
in
--
in
a
wasteful
activity.”
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it
could
have
said
you
can't
produce
gas
for
that
purpose
and
wald
would
have
permitted
it
and
henderson
would
have
permitted
it
and
champlin
would
have
permitted
and
ohio
law
and
all
the
other
cases.
now,
instead
of
that,
kansas
said,
“you
can't
take
that
gas
out
there
unless
you
realize
11
--
8
cents
for
it,
unless
you
treat
it
as
though
it
will
work,
8
cents.
and
if
you
treated
as
though
it
will
work,
the
8
cents,
then
you
can
use
it.
what
happened?
the
record
is
clear.
when
that
8-cent
order
went
into
effect
that
the
old
channel
iron
factories
or
carbon
black
plants
out
of
the
kansas
hugoton
field
closed
up,
we
have
two
left,
one
or
two
left,
the
record
shows.
because
they
couldn't
treat
that
gas
as
though
it
was
worth
8
cents
and
still
abide
by
the
minimum
value
attribution
order.
the
record
also
shows
that
dump
gas
--
or
--
or
a
dump
gas
which
were
shipped
in
--
to
huge
industrial
furnaces
to
burn
as
boiler
fuel,
that
that
was
diverted,
and
for
who's
benefit?
the
ultimate
consumer.
now,
the
concern
of
the
ultimate
consumer
isn't
all
in
the
mind
of
the
solicitor
general.
you
must
recall
that
48.5%
of
this
gas
that
appellant
producers
in
the
hugoton
--
kansas
hugoton
field
is
consumed
in
kansas
and
consumers
interest
were
represented
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
president's
materials
policy
commission
report
to
--
to
illustrate
my
argument,
on
page
16
of
volume
3
of
that
report,
it
is
said
there
are
four
important
challengers
to
our
natural
gas
economy.”
number
one,
to
stimulate
maximum
economic
discovery
of
natural
gas
resources.
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
that
has
resulted
from
the
8-cent
order
and
is
--
and
will
result
from
the
11-cent
order.
to
avoid
wasting
the
production
of
natural
gas,
the
evidence
shows
--
that
was
the
second
point
the
president's
commission
make.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
8-cent
order
did
this
and
that
the
11-cent
order
has
a
tendency
to
do
this.
there's
a
risk
that
--
that's
paragraph
--
paragraph
b.
it
doesn't
relate
to
this
case,
but
paragraph
c
says,
“to
improve
the
pattern
of
use
that
so
relatively
more
gas
goes
to
those
users
in
which
it
has
a
special
advantage
and
relatively
last
to
those
that
could
be
served
just
as
well
by
other
fuels.”
and
the
record
shows
also
that
this
then
is
undisputed.
there
are
economists
--
probably
one
of
the
greatest
economists
in
the
country
happens
to
come
from
kansas.
he
testified
as
to
what
the
result
would
be,
and
engineers
who
were
familiar
with
it.
now,
that's
the
third
thing
the
president
feel,
the
president's
commission.
this
is
my
way
of
illustrating
a
point.
the
fourth
one,
to
lay
for
--
the
basis
for
an
orderly
transition
to
other
fuels
at
that
distance
with
inevitable
date
when
natural
gas
production
falls
off.
now,
that
also
is
achieved
by
this
order.
the
--
this
order
will
tend
to
produce
substitutes
for
natural
gas.
now,
there
wasn't
anything
said
in
the
president's
material
policy
report
about
prices
to
domestic
consumers.
they're
high
enough
now.
what
we're
doing
under
this
kansas
procedure
is
to
--
is
to
--
the
poor
consumers
that
the
solicitor
general
is
concerned
about
are
large
industrial
plants
that
uses
gas
for
boiler
fuel
and
they
can't
use
the
gas
for
boiler
fuel
if
you
give
it
just
a
minimal
value
at
the
wellhead.
the
consumers
who
are
deprived
of
this
gas
by
this
order
are
those
inefficient
uses
--
users,
that
the
president's
commission
points
out
are
wasting
our
natural
resource
and
we're
talking
about
a
natural
resource
here
that's
being
consumed
at
500
times
the
rate
the
coal
is
being
consumed.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
--
i
will,
but
i
honestly
can't
accept
your
--
your
--
the
words
you
used
to
describe
the
kansas
order.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
but
i
--
i
see
what
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
all
right.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
all
right.
i
--
i
will
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
don't
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
--
i
will
address
myself
to
that
proposition.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no.
they
--
i
think
i
can
--
i
can
start
out
with
answering
your
questions.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
yes.
i
think
so.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
i
--
i
begin
with
--
i
begin
with
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
say
the
federal
power
commission
cannot
do
this
and
i
rely
on
hope,
primarily.
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
to
use
price
as
a
conservation
measure.
mr.
justice
jackson,
in
hope,
told
west
virginia
that
it
would
have
to
--
it
would
have
to
look
to
itself
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
in
the
dissent.
i
beg
your
pardon.
this
court
told
west
virginia.
this
court
told
west
virginia
who
was
urging
upon
this
court
the
very
considerations
which
we
stand
before
the
court,
urging
upon
it
now
and
it
told
west
virginia,
“we're
sorry.”
conservation
and
protection
of
correlative
rights
is
a
matter
for
the
states.
you
have
to
take
care
of
your
own
problem
in
that
area.
we're
just
interested
here
in
an
act
which
uses
a
conventional
--
a
conventional
approach
to
ratemaking.
we're
just
interested
in
that
the
---
the
usual
utility
regulation
and
the
usual
utility
regulation
except
for
7
(a),
where
they
have
the
rights
to
issue
certificates,
opinions
and
necessity.
you
just
decide
what
--
what
a
fair
and
reasonable
return
should
be
on
some
rate
base.
now,
that's
an
over
simplification
of
the
hope
case
but
i
--
i
believe
that
the
hope
case
held
that.
and
the
reason
i
mentioned
mr.
justice
jackson's
dissent
was,
that
he's
so
vigorously
urged,
that
the
federal
power
commission
should
conserve
the
gas.
that
it
should
not
be
permitted
to
be
used
for
these
inferior
purposes
and
wasteful
usage.
and
that
the
federal
power
commission
should
use
price
as
a
tool
as
he
described
it
to
conserve
gas
and
this
court
said
and
i
believe
rightly
so
that
when
the
natural
gas
act
was
passed
in
1938,
congress
was
interested
then
in
preventing
these
large
pipeline
monopolies,
the
holding
companies
based
on
the
federal
trade
commission's
investigation.
it
was
interested
in
--
in
protecting
the
consumer
from
excessive
rates
--
excessive
rates
profits
resulting
from
the
interstate
shipment
of
gas.
now,
there
is
--
there
is
a
conflict
between
this
problem
of
--
of
low
rates
at
the
consumer's
end
and
an
attempt
to
conserve
gas
by
price
attribution,
as
i
like
to
call
it
and
insist
on
calling
it,
at
the
other
end.
there
is
a
kind
of
a
conflict
but
there's
one
thing
that's
--
there's
not
--
there's
any
--
no
question
about
it
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
price,
value
and
use.
and
that
price
is
a
tool
and
a
very
effective
tool
for
conservation.
now
the
question
is,
does
the
federal
power
commission
have
the
jurisdiction
to
use
that
tool
or
did
that
remain
in
the
states
in
1938?
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
act,
in
the
history
of
the
act
that
i've
been
able
to
determine
from
the
--
what
study
i
was
--
i've
been
able
to
have
in
our
library
particularly
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
history
of
the
act.
nothing
to
indicate
in
the
history
of
the
act
that
the
federal
power
commission
was
going
to
step
in
and
start
regulating
the
production
of
gas
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
it.
indeed,
all
of
the
history
of
this
act
shows
that
the
states
were
assured
time
and
time
again
that
this
was
simply
a
rate
regulation
law
which
was
designed
to
step
into
that
area
where
the
states
had
been
told
by
this
court
they
could
not
act.
so
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
it
seems
to
me
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
to
start
with
1938
and
go
back,
and
what
do
i
look
for?
i
go
back
and
i
iook
for
a
case.
i'll
look
for
some
case
holding
that
this
state
of
kansas
could
not
use
the
device
of
end
use
regulation
or
device
of
price
as
a
conservation
measure.
now,
i
have
not
found
such
a
case
and
i'm
confident
that
counsel
had
not
found
such
a
case.
that
power
was
not
taken
away
from
the
state.
that
power
existed
at
that
time.
the
tool
is
well-known.
now
if
its
use
has
been
--
if
its
use
has
come
late
in
the
history
of
this
country,
i
must
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
states
talked
to
the
federal
government
how
to
regulate
utilities.
we
had
state
regulation
first
and
then
the
federal
government
put
in
the
icc
and
the
fpc.
now
it
may
seem
novel
that
the
state
would
use
this
tool
as
late
as
1948
but
price
and
use
and
conservation
have
--
the
relationship
between
them
have
been
long
--
well-known
for
a
long
time.
as
dr.
(inaudible)
said,
alfred
marshall,
one
of
the
greatest
economists
in
the
last
century
pointed
out
that
relationship.
so
the
state
has
used
a
tool.
why?
to
conserve
gas
and
protect
correlative
rights
and
there's
no
question
in
this
case
but
what
it
served
that
purpose
and
it
does
serve
that
purpose.
now,
i
say
there
haven't
been
any
cases
against
it.
there
haven't
been
any
cases
saying
the
states
couldn't
do
this.
now,
what
did
the
cases
say?
the
cases
said
that
states
could
--
could
regulate
end
use
by
a
regulation
of
real
property
telling
--
telling
the
states
they
could
not
produce
or
telling
the
companies
they
could
not
produce
gas
if
they
use
them
in
certain
wasteful
ways,
wasteful
manners.
now,
a
certificate
by
the
federal
power
commission
permitting
someone
to
use
it
as
a
carbon
black
plant
certainly
wouldn't
prevail
in
view
of
the
doctrine
before
1938.
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
to
give
way.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
interstate
case.
if
there
was
any
conflict,
it's
not
the
--
it's
not
the
supremacy
clause
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
solicitor
general
mentions
in
his
--
his
brief.
if
there's
any
conflict,
the
federal
government
has
to
give
a
way
in
this
area
if
the
order
is
reasonably
related
to
conservation
and
protection
of
correlative
rights
and
that's
why
it
was
--
that's
why
i
wanted
to
point
out
the
record
to
show
that
it
was
reasonably
related
to
this
question
and
if
it
is,
it's
not
the
state
of
kansas
that
has
to
give
a
way.
this
court
has
said
that
state
regulation,
that
the
federal
government
may
regulate
these
rates,
certain
rates,
unless
such
regulation
comes
in
conflict
with
valid
state
regulations
of
production
and
gathering
and
then
the
federal
regulation
must
give
way.
now,
that's
what
the
law
is.
now,
i
mentioned
the
champlin
refining
company
case
in
which
--
in
which
--
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
oklahoma
limited
the
production
from
the
wells
to
6%
of
what
they
produced.
now,
that
wasn't
price
fixing
but
certainly
limiting
the
production
to
6%
of
what
they
will
produce
has
a
very
direct
affect
on
price
and
it
was
urged
in
that
case
whether
--
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
and
this
court
upheld
that
as
a
valid
regulation
of
production
in
conservation
of
natural
gas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
have
several
answers,
i
believe,
to
your
question.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
let
me
suggest
this.
i
have
one
answer.
if
this
is
a
regulation
--
if
--
if
this
is
a
regulation
of
price
at
the
--
it
is
at
the
wellhead
and
it's
closely
connected
with
production.
now,
i
had
--
i
stated
yesterday
that
we
don't
rely
on
the
production
of
gathering
exemption
because
we
think
our
--
our
position
goes
behind
the
natural
gas
act.
but
if
it
is,
if
this
is
price
fixing
at
the
wellhead,
it's
not
covered
by
the
natural
gas
act
because
it's
so
closely
related
to
production
and
gathering
which
--
and
this
--
this
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
production
and
gathering
of
natural
gas.
it's
not
the
phillips
case
and
it's
not
the
panoma
case
where
the
price
was
fixed
after
production
and
gathering
had
been
completed.
so
if
you
tell
me
that
this
is
price
fixing,
i
say
it's
price
fixing
at
the
wellhead
and
this
court
has
never
said
the
federal
power
commission
has
that
power.
and
it's
price
fixing
for
the
purposes
of
conservation
of
gas
and
thus
comes
within
the
exemption
of
the
natural
gas
act.
well,
i
think
it
goes
further.
it
existed
before
1938
and
it's
not
a
regulation
of
a
sale
or
a
transportation.
now,
i
don't
care
what
you
call
this
order
but
there's
a
difference
between
regulating
a
sale
and
fixing
a
--
this
isn't
the
highest
price
that
existed
in
1952
or
where
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
i
say
this,
you've
got
to
go
back
to
1938
and
you've
got
to
see
whether
the
state
could
have
done
this
in
1938,
and
then
you
have
to
see
whether
congress
attempted
to
impose,
to
give
the
federal
power
commission
the
right
to
conserve
gas
or
the
right
to
regulate
its
production
or
there
might
deregulate
correlative
rights.
how
can
the
federal
power
commission
go
out
there
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
and
take
care
of
these
many
peculiar
problems
that
result
from
these
price
discriminations.
these
fixed
prices
imposed
by
these
companies,
and
i
can't
describe
it
in
general
term
without
using
that
kind
of
language
because
that's
exactly
what
happened.
now
how
can
the
federal
power
commission
go
out
to
kansas
and
adjust
correlative
rights
when
price
is
a
necessary
tool
for
that
purpose?
congress
never
intended
that
and
we
regulate
the
severance
just
like
we
did
in
--
in
champlin
case.
but
now,
let's
talk
about
price.
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
effect.
we're
talking
about
an
economic
effect
and
it's
a
fair
question
to
ask
me,
don't
--
isn't
this
the
same
as
--
doesn't
this
have
an
economic
effect?
and
i
say
it
has
the
same
identical
economic
effect
as
does
the
severance
tax
at
the
wellhead.
it's
no
different.
the
severance
tax
fixes
the
price.
the
minimum
price
that
you
could
pay
for
that
gas
was
at
least
to
pay
the
tax.
you'll
never
pay
it
anymore.
and
if
--if
they
refuse
to
agree
on
the
tax,
the
state
would
say,
"well,
we're
going
to
pretend
it's
worth
so
much
and
we're
going
to
take
2%
of
that."
now,
that
affects
the
price
just
as
directly
as
this
does.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
yes,
we
do.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
yes,
we
do.
we
do.
we
do
in
kansas.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
it's
paid
by
the
private
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
--
the
producer
of
the
gas
and
the
--
the
owners
of
the
companies
working
--
working
interstate.
it's
--
now
there's
an
interesting
case.
there's
an
interesting
louisiana
case
that
i
--
that
is
growing
on
me
as
i
thought
about
this
case
and
that's
the
lacoste
case.
now
in
louisiana,
the
state
fixed
the
price
on
alligator
hides
in
animals.
they
said
how
much
the
alligators'
hides
in
animals
would
be
worth
and
then
they
levied
a
severance
tax
on
it.
but
the
interesting
thing
about
the
case
is
--
there
are
a
lot
of
severance
tax
cases.
the
interesting
thing
about
that
case
was
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
those
alligator
hides
in
animals.
now,
the
only
thing
wrong
with
that
case
is
that
apparently,
the
state
had
some
kind
of
ownership
in
the
wild
--
in
the
wild
animals.
but
the
fact
was
that
all
of
these
went
out
of
--
went
out
of
the
state
and
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
this
is
before
1938,
levied
a
severance
tax.
why?
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
these
hides.
now
that
power
existed
prior
to
1938
and
the
states
were
assured
by
the
proponents
of
this
bill
that
nothing
was
taken
out,
no
power
was
taken
away
from
it.
then
we
have
the
bayside
fishery
case.
that
was
a
regulation
of
end
use
for
conservation
purposes.
it
wasn't
a
price
fixing
case
but
it
was
a
regulation
of
end
use.
so
we
have
prior
to
1938,
paramount
power.
we're
talking
about
jurisdiction.
we're
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
in
the
field
of
conservation
and
protection
of
correlative
rights.
now,
the
--
this
court
has
said
that
there
was
no
intent
to
deprive
the
state
of
those
powers
and
this
record
shows,
and
i'm
--
i'm
--
the
record
is
well
indexed
and
i
--
i
think
it's
very
important
that
this
court
understand
what
this
record
shows;
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
protect
correlative
rights
out
in
kansas
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
existing
out
there.
and
that
this
--
this
is
a
very
effective
way
to
protect
the
--
the
natural
resources
from
waste,
particularly
those
lower
uses
that
this
gas
was
going
to
has
one
witness
said
you
drive
through
the
kansas
hugoton
field
and
you'd
never
get
outside
the
smoke.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
you
could
do
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
mr.
justice
whittaker,
we
could
have
done
it
perhaps
other
ways
but
we
have
the
power
and
we
used
the
most
effective
method
that
could
be
used.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
well,
when
we
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
right.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
but
where
did
the
federal
power
commission
get
this
power?
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
where
did
the
federal
power
commission
get
this
power?
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no,
it
must
have
gotten
the
power
to
--
power
from
the
natural
gas
act.
and
the
natural
gas
act
gave
the
federal
power
commission
the
power
only
over
three
things,
as
this
court
had
said
and
as
i
recall
--
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
that's
right.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
when
i'm
talking
about
this
specific
power,
the
federal
power
commission,
the
regulation
of
transportation
in
--
transportation
interstate
commerce,
the
regulation
of
sales
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
regulation
of
natural
gas
companies
and
it
--
and
then
it
said
that
it
shall
have
no
power
to
regulate
the
production
or
the
gathering
of
natural
gas.
now,
i
don't
care
how
you
describe
this
order.
a
price
order,
you
can't
get
away
from
the
fact
that
it
never
goes
beyond
the
wellhead
and
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
production
of
--
and
gathering
of
gas,
and
it
was
so
desire.
so
the
federal
power
commission
never
got
the
power.
it
just
never
got
the
power.
if
--
if
the
power
stays
where
--
where
it
always
was
in
the
states.
what
if
--
what
is
happening
here
is
if
--if
--
if
the
federal
power
commission
is
right,
we
are
creating
a
new
gap,
a
new
hiatus
in
regulation
where
none
ever
existed
before.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
this
case
will
create
a
new
gap
in
regulation.
mr.
dale
m.
stucky
no,
they
didn't.
phillips
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
power
of
the
state
under
its
--
as
a
--
as
a
conservator
of
our
resources.
phillips
was
a
rate
case
and
the
rates
were
fixed
after
production
and
gathering
had
ended.
the
gas
was
produced,
was
sold
to
phillips.
it
put
it
through
a
processing
plant
and
then
it
was
--
it
was
sold
after
production
and
gathering
has
ended.
now
panoma
was
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
as
this
court
said
in
the
panoma
decision,
this
is
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
oklahoma
to
fix
a
price
for
gas
after
production
and
gathering
has
ended,
and
that
was
a
case
that
had
to
do
with
residue
gas.
it
was
residue
gas
after
that
had
been
manufactured
and
--
and
put
through
this
plant
and
the
residue
gas,
they
--
they
try
to
reach
way
out
to
residue
gas
and
the
difference
as
i
stated
yesterday
between
this
and
panoma
is
that
the
same
difference
as
between
the
hall
case
and
the
calvert
case.
those
--
the
old
hall
which
was
a
--
a
severance
tax
based
on
the
value
of
the
wellhead
and
the
calvert
case
which
was
decided
the
same
term
as
phillips
where
--
where
texas
tried
to
levy
what
it
called
a
"taking"
tax
after
--
to
--
to
take
the
gas
out
of
the
state.
in
other
words,
to
--
to
add
another
tax
on
top
of
the
severance
tax.
and
the
same
distinction
exists
between
this
case
and
panoma
as
existed
between
hall
and
calvert.
one
is
wellhead
and
one
is
after
production
and
gathering
has
ended.
and
they
did
the
same
thing.
in
the
calvert's
case,
they
said,
"well,
we
--
it's
just
on
the
taking."
and
the
inference
was
that
the
taking
was
from
the
--
from
the
wellhead,
just
a
cities
service
says
to
this
court
that
because
the
order
says,
“all
those
who
take
gas,
it
applies
to
them.”
now,
they
don't
take
gas
from
the
hugoton
field
within
the
meaning
of
the
order.
it's
a
wellhead
order.
it
might
have
been
construed
as
applying
to
the
purchaser.
but
it
wasn't
so
construed
--
it
wasn't
so
construed
and
it
wasn't
so
applied.
so
cities
service
stands
in
the
place
of
the
taker
in
the
calvert
case.
and
i
say
that
a
new
gap
exist
because
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
power
or
authority
to
use
a
well-recognized
tool
price
rates.
now,
what
does
that
leave
us?it
leaves
us
a
hiatus.
our
economists
know
that
this
is
so
and
it'd
known
it
a
long
time.
they
know
that
--
that
we
are
wasting
our
gas
sinfully
and
it's
a
national
property.
two-tenths
of
1%
of
our
total
fuel
resources
are
gas.
only
two-tenths
of
1%
are
gas
and
we're
using
it
500
times
as
we
are
our
coal.
that's
a
record.
it's
a
flush
production
fuel.
everybody
knows
it's
a
problem
and
the
federal
power
commission
is
handcuffed
because
it
can't
use
this
well-recognized
tool
to
conserve
gas.
now
certainly
when
they
passed
the
natural
gas
act,
they
didn't
attempt
to
take
these
pipeline
companies
out
of
the
field
of
regulation.
it
was
to
--
designed
to
complement
the
powers
of
the
state.
so
as
i
see
this
case,
it's
a
question
of
whether
this
country
can
use
a
well-recognized
principle
of
economics
to
conserve
a
precious
natural
resource
or
whether
that
tool
can't
be
used
although
this
court
and
all
courts
have
recognized
who've
discussed
the
problem.
all
courts
have
recognized
the
efficacy
of
the
tool.
now,
we
have
a
little
problem
getting
our
point
across
because
this
is
a
national
problem,
not
just
a
state
problem,
but
states
have
solved
national
problems
before.
we
have
a
national
interest
in
conservation
but
heretofore
the
states
have
protected
that
national
interest
and
i
think
pretty
well,
at
--
at
least
this
court
has
thought
so.
and
the
states
can
be
entrusted
to
protect
national
interest.they
may
use
them
on
ideas
once
in
a
while.
but
this
is
not
for
many
economists'
point
of
view
and
the
record
will
show
that
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
best
talk
on
this
matter
agrees
with
this
point
of
view.
it
admittedly
achieves
the
purpose
it
was
designed
to
achieve,
conservation,
protects
the
correlative
rights.
it's
reasonably
designed
for
that
purpose
and
we
believe
that
when
this
court
examines
the
power
which
the
states
have,
1938,
examines
the
hiatus
which
--
this
is
the
--
in
which
cities
service
would
try
to
create
in
this
area
of
regulation.
that
--
and
examines
all
of
the
--
the
--
the
cases.
we
think
the
--
the
important
cases
