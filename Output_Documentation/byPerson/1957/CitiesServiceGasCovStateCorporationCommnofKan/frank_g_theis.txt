mr.
frank
g.
theis
court
please.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
might
say
that
my
first
connection
with
this
case
was
back
in
the
fall
of
1952,
your
honor,
when
i
was
the
chief
counsel
for
the
office
of
price
stabilization
in
kansas
and
we
got
a
wire
out
there
in
kansas
that
are
office
to
(inaudible)
the
national
counsel
to
go
up
and
check
on
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
regulation
to
the
price
of
gas.
possibly,
it
might
be
made
by
the
corporation
commission
in
the
state
of
kansas.
this
is
irrelevant.
i
say
this
merely
as
a
--
to
show
you
our
concept
to
the
thing.
we
went
to
topeka.
we
listened
in
on
the
evidence
of
this
case.
we
were
convinced
that
it
was
a
conservation
case
and
not
a
rate
case
and
--
and
we
got
out
of
it
and
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
matter.
i
don't
quote
that
to
your
honors
as
authoritative
but
that
was
my
introduction
to
this
matter.
and
i
admit
that
when
i
first
heard
about
this
case,
i
thought
that
that
was
--
to
use
the
phrase
there,
a
rather
screwing
device
to
use
price
as
a
conservation
matter.
however
--
and
mr.
frankfurter
pose
this
question
earlier.
our
corporation
commission
did
hear
evidence
on
the
case
and
--
and
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
the
--
to
the
facts
here
because
the
courts
already
indicated
that
they
will
take
them
out
of
the
record.
the
court
did
hear
evidence.
they
did
find
that
this
was
an
effective
conservation
tool,
as
mr.
stucky
has
outlined
very
effectively
to
you,
i
think.
and
the
--
and
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
both
in
the
kansas-nebraska
case
which
was
the
8-cent
case,
and
our
supreme
court
in
this
case
upheld
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
corporation
commission
as
being
within
the
kansas
statute
on
conservation
which
is
chapter
55,
701
to
713,
and
i
think
that
that
statute
is
referred
to
by
this
court.
in
the
case
of
fpc
versus
the
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
company
is
one
of
the
traditional
powers
of
the
--
is
one
of
the
conservation
statutes
and
one
of
the
--
the
powers
of
the
state
head
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
natural
gas
act
in
1938.
now,
i
wanted
--
any
power
that
the
federal
government
has
as
--
as
justice
whittaker
indicated
a
while
ago
on
the
federal
--
on
--
the
natural
gas
act
was
necessarily
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
i
want
to
direct
my
remarks
for
a
few
minutes
to
another
aspect
of
it
that
has
been
touched
on,
but
i
think
it
is
important.
mr.
stucky
is
--
has
outlined
the
fact
that
--
it
is
our
feeling
that
these
powers
are
concurrent
that
the
--
the
state
has
the
right
to
act
on
the
conservation
field,
that
the
federal
government
and
the
fpc
are
--
and
the
fpc
does
not
have
the
authority
to
act
in
the
--
in
the
field
of
conservation,
that
they
do
not
have
the
authority
under
inferences
from
the
judgments
of
this
court,
that
--
that
they
can
even
use
price
as
a
tool
for
conservation.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
right.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
i
would
like
--
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
not
dwell
on
that
part
of
it
further.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
green
brief
which
mr.
stucky
indicated
to
the
court
contains
an
outline
we
think
very
clearly
our
thinking
on
the
proposition
and
--
and
surely
before
the
argument
in
this
case,
there
was
another
green
brief
filed
here
by
the
attorney
generals
of
12
of
the
states
and
i
think
subsequently
a
white
one
by
illinois
in
which
they
outlined
some
pertinent
observations
we
feel
about
the
--
the
powers
of
that
state.
and
i
would
like
to
direct
my
remarks
for
a
few
moments
along
those
lines.
we're
all
conscious
to
the
tenth
amendment
and
i
know
that
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
last
20
years,
shall
we
say,
many
of
them
have
--
have
brought
about
the
many
interpretations
in
the
field
of
constitutional
law
and
i
am
not
going
to
stand
here
and
--
and
make
any
oration
about
states
right
because
my
political
philosophy
is
not
oriented
in
that
matter
but
i
do
think
that
the
--
that
the
tenth
amendment,
the
reservation
of
the
rights
of
the
states
at
this
matter
deserves
a
consideration.
i
don't
think
that
the
matter
of
the
correlative
rights
have
been
going
into
(inaudible).
correlative
rights,
in
this
case,
this
court
has
held
--
the
kansas
court
has
held
that
this
gas
in
place
in
the
earth
is
real
estate
and
they
now
--
it
underlies
the
land
of
these
landowners
out
in
the
hugoton
field.
as
the
record
shows,
there's
evidence
that
--
that
neighbors
were
getting
different
prices
and
so
forth.
i
mean
a
return
for
royalty
on
their
land.
we
--
we
think
--
and
the
gas
was
being
drained
from
under
the
land
of
one
owner
out
of
the
--
of
a
well
on
another
owner's
land.
we
think
that
certainly
is
an
established
right
of
the
states
to
regulate
rights
and
property.
and
we
want
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
order
was
directed
at
that
along
with
the
conservation,
correlative
rights
and
conservation,
and
we
think
that
was
one
of
the
inherent
reserved
rights
of
the
state
of
kansas
and
that
the
federal
power
commission
as
mr.
stucky
said
and
i'm
not
going
to
go
over
his
argument,
cannot
get
into
that
field.
we
think
that's
foreclosed
by
the
constitution
of
--
of
the
united
states.
the
state
of
kansas
does
have
a
severance
tax.
i
think
its
1%.
out
in
kansas
right
now,
the
states
--
kansas
is
no
different
than
any
other
states.
the
state
and
all
its
subdivisions,
municipalities,
counties,
they're
all
placed
with
--
with
the
problem
of
getting
enough
revenue
to
maintain
the
services
the
state
and
local
government
should
--
should
perform.
i
suppose
that
--
that
in
this
session,
the
legislature
perhaps
somebody
will
introduce
a
bill
that'll
raise
the
severance
tax
mr.
frank
g.
theis
not,
except
as
a
--
as
a
comparison.
as
mr.
stucky
said,
we
think
the
same
principle
that
would
--
that
would
validate
the
severance
tax
--
would
validate
the
--
the
price
action
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
realize
that
point.
i
think
we
--
it
becomes
a
play
on
words
as
we've
--
it's
been
said
here
before.
certainly
the
severance
tax
is
based
on
--
on
a
value
of
the
gas.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
the
comparison
of
course
was
--
here
was
the
use
of
value
as
in
the
lacoste
case
and
other
cases
for
a
different
purpose
to
get
taxes
for
the
state
instead
of
conservation.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
that
of
course
your
honor,
mr.
justices,
is
one
of
the
things
to
be
determined
in
this
case,
i
think.
well,
they
are
not
the
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
that
if
they
--
if
they
collide
head-on
and
the
federal
government
had
that
authorized
--
authorized
power
that
under
the
natural
gas
act,
i
mean
--
and
--
and
assuming
all
of
the
things
that
you
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
we
don't
think
that's
necessary
at
all,
your
honor,
and
--
and
as
my
colleague
has
said
here,
phillips
and
panoma
are
distinguished.
well,
at
least
all
we
lawyers
have
to
go
on
as
to
the
words
of
the
court
on
the
fact
that
these
were
struck
down
because
they
were
after
production
and
gathering
had
ended.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
our
court
has
found
that,
sir.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
i
went
over
the
case
this
morning,
your
honor,
of
the
--
the
previous
case
and
i
read
those
cases
and
i
don't
believe
they
found
exactly
that,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
there
might
be
some
argument
as
to
whether
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
wholesale
as
they
say
in
interstate
commerce.
i
mean,
there
were
certainly
a
transfer
for
consideration
in
the
first
instance
after
it
got
out
of
the
ground.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
--
very
nearly,
is
like
the
price
of
eggs
for
instance.
there's
a
lot
of
difference
in
the
--
i
mean,
the
first
cost
of
eggs
and
--
and
what
they
cost
you
when
you
get
them
at
the
grocery
store
and
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
here,
there's
lots
of
factors
that
--
that
affect
price.
the
state
is
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
it
doesn't
purport
however,
mr.
justice
black,
to
--
to
regulate
sales
at
the
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
that's
correct,
and
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
--
it
may
be
an
impediment
on
--
on
sale
and
certainly,
we're
not
denying
the
fact
that
--
that
--
really,
that
is
--
its
effect
was
to
raise
the
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
--
the
cost
or
the
price
of
the
gas.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
its
purpose
was
a
conservation.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
i
think
that's
right.
let's
--
i
mean,
we're
a
reasonable
man
and
i
mean
that
--
that
was
it.
i
mean
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
we're
not
willing
to
admit
that,
your
honor,
and
i
--
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
no,
it
--
it
applied
very
--
it
applied
to
both
of
them.
the
point
we're
trying
to
make
your
honor
was
that
--
less
effective
--
effective
to
gas
before
it
got
in
to
interstate
commerce
and
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
this
court,
i
mean,
on
the
minnesota
mining
case
and
the
west
virginia
cases,
i
mean,
this
movement
business
doesn't
enter
to
it.
i
mean,
it
hadn't
got
in
to
interstate
commerce
at
the
moment
of
incident
to
the
kansas
statute.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
mr.
chief
justice,
those
are
--
those
are
broad
words,
i
agree,
and
it
certainly
our
hope
and
we
--
we
think
on
the
--
on
the
basis
that
mr.
stucky's
outline,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
it
again.
we
think
that
--
that
it's
on
a
sound
legal
foundation
that
the
--
that
we
do
have
--
do
have
that
power.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
i
--
if
the
statement
in
its
all
of
its
broad
implication,
as
broad
as
--
as
your
honor
state,
it
certainly
will
--
might
have
to
be
qualified
to
some
respect.
either
this
--
this
particular
situation,
factually,
that
involves
and
--
that's
involved
in
this
case
has
never
been
before
this
court.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
possibly,
except
that
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
cases
with
similar
incidents.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
rate
case.
it's
involved
a
--
a
gas
company
and
this
is
a
--
has
an
invocation
with
the
state
or
one
of
the
things
that
are
--
one
of
the
sovereign
powers
that
i
believe
it
had.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
right.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
as
i
say,
our
contention
is
that
the
incidents
of
it
is
--
is
before
it
gets
into
interstate
commerce.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
that
--
mr.
frank
g.
theis
i
agree.
i
agree
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
the
--
the
price
would
be
shoved
down
the
line,
the
price
or
the
cost
or
the
value
or
whatever
you
attribute
to
it,
but
from
a
--
from
a
legal
point
of
view
and
i
--
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
and
its
order
found
that
this
attached
to
the
--
to
the
gas
before
it
got
into
interstate
commerce.
in
any
event,
we
and
the
state
of
kansas
view
this
and
in
the
attorney
generals
of
the
other
states
view
some
of
the
implications
of
this
case
as
--
as
quite
ominous
in
the
--
in
constitutional
interpretation.
out
there
in
kansas,
we
think
that
this
--
this
case
and
i
believe
those
who
support
it
think
that
in
this
case
that
we're
rather
at
the
crossroads.
i
mean,
this
struck
down
when
we
think
it's
an
entering
words
to
strike
down
a
lot
of
other
legitimate
activities
of
the
--
of
the
state.
we
believe
that
we're
on
legal
grounds
and
that
panoma
and
phillips
are
distinguishable
and
as
my
colleague
has
stated
in
the
brief
adequately
covered,
we
believe,
we
think
there
--
that
the
law
in
the
case
justifies
the
approvable
of
the
action
of
the
state
of
kansas.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
well,
of
course
that
aspect
of
it,
i
--
i
suppose
there
wouldn't
be
any
objection
to,
but
i
mean,
certainly,
that
situation
is
not
going
to
come
about.
i
mean,
you
can't
have
a
situation
of
--
of
half
and
half
as
a
--
as
a
practical
consideration.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
yes.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
they're
great,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
g.
theis
thank
you
very
much.
