justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
sense,
mr.
fitzpatrick
that
the
mccray
case
will
be
referred
to
in
the
feldman
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say,
perhaps,
was
saying
that
the
mccray
case
was
referred
to
in
the
feldman
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
that
you
said
that.
i'm
suggesting
that
--
it's
in
reply
to
your
suggestion
that
all
along,
the
united
states'
petition
in
this
court
have
rested
on
the
disregard
of
the
mccray
case
as
addressing
the
two
kingdoms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
say
is
that
it's
been
ensured
an
awareness
of
its
existence
because
it
cited
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
void,
but
inadequate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
you
say
for
the
situation,
you
can't
narrow
it
as
you
--
as
you
effectively
enough
of
narrowing
your
argument
to
the
fact
that
geographically,
it
took
place
in
the
city
of
new
york
rather
than
in
illinois
county
or
etcetera,
etcetera.
because
if
the
claim
is
valid,
i
mean,
if
your
contention
is
valid,
then
i
should
think
it
has
to
be
recognized.
i
don't
see
how
i
want
for
the
state
recognizing
it
with
the
full
reach
of
what
would
be
an
allowable
frame
of
privilege
in
a
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
denzer,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
--
suppose
the
petitioner
had
been
summoned
before
a
federal
grand
jury
and
he
was
--
had
been
asked
these
questions,
could
he
invoke
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
whether
it
would
be
called
into
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
the
facts.
are
there
any
suggestions
in
the
--
does
the
record
disclose
whether
in
the
state
proceeding,
any
references
made
to
the
potential
prosecutorial
interest
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
case
gets
down
to
this,
does
it,
that
a
proceeding
properly
pursued
for
a
state
grand
jury
under
the
state
criminal
law.
the
witness
is
asked
to
give
some
evidence
and
he
pleads
freedom
from
answer
because
if
he
had
been
summoned
or
if
he
were
to
be
summoned
in
the
federal
court
and
asked
those
questions,
there
he
could
plead
his
privilege.
is
that
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
question.
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
talked
about
it.
i've
just
asked
you
whether
the
case
is
that
being
properly
summoned
before
a
state
grand
jury
and
questions
properly
put
to
him,
which
if
you
just
think
of
the
state
of
new
york,
he
would
have
to
answer.
he
can
be
relieved
from
answering
because
he
says
under
the
fifth
amendment,
if
he
were
asked
those
questions
in
a
federal
tribunal,
he
could
--
he
could
stand
his
ground
and
refuse
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
that
he
can
stand
his
ground
on
the
federal
court
is
that
he
can
protect
himself
against
adverse
use
of
it
and
the
prosecution
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
it
isn't
the
case.
let
me
put
to
you
a
hypothetical
situation.
suppose
mr.
williams
had
written
to
mr.
hogan
and
i
see
by
one
of
the
tabloids
that
you're
going
to
have
milton
knapp
before
your
grand
jury,
i
wish
you
would
ask
him
the
following
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wish
you
would
ask
him
the
following
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
mr.
williams
set
forth
three
questions
in
this
general
field.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
do
with
that
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
that
--
you
mean
to
say
that
if
thereafter,
the
questions
elicited
at
the
request
of
mr.
williams
to
mr.
hogan,
they
could
thereafter
--
mr.
williams
could
thereafter
use
that
testimony
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
prosecution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
question
about
using
it.
what
about
refusing
to
answer
because
in
that
easy
--
free
and
easy
way
in
which
new
york
goes
on
before
grand
jury
and
elsewhere,
is
first
given
to
the
press,
mr.
knapp
would
know
about
it
that
mr.
williams
had
written
such
a
communication
to
mr.
hogan,
could
he
say,
i
refuse
to
answer
because
i
read
by
this
morning
to
whatever
post
news
or
american,
that
mr.
williams
is
much
interested
in
what
i
am
to
testify
and
therefore
i
refuse
to
stand
my
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
the
potential
--
the
potential
use
that
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
might
make,
a
disclosure
that
you
had
obtained
before
the
county
grand
jury,
it
is
a
different
case
from
the
explicit
collaboration
between
the
two
district
attorneys.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
--
you'd
say
reality
and
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
in
what
bases
of
experience
you
speak?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
district
attorney's
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
say
as
a
matter
of
practice.
i
want
to
know
what's
the
basis
of
your
--
your
vouching
practice,
your
personal
experience
in
the
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct
me.
i
speak
from
a
stale
memory.
but
i'd
suppose
the
right
to
look
at
the
--
examined
the
grand
jury
minutes
in
the
state
of
new
york
is
the
defendant's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
i
don't
mean
that's
his
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
is
the
fellow
who
can
move.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
how
relevant
it
is,
but
in
my
experience,
the
aspect
of
collaboration
like
for
each
district
attorney's
office
to
get
the
other
fellow
to
keep
hands
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
feldman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
--
am
i
right
in
recalling
and
i
may
well
be
wrong,
that
the
new
york
state
constitution
did
not
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
until
relatively
recent
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
to
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
embodied
to
the
constitution
of
new
york
until
--
whatever
it
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
that
had
been
his
position
then
the
claim
of
privilege
could
be
asserted
with
complete
indifference
whether
there
is
any
federal
criminal
statute
that
remotely
is
applicable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
which
the
evidence
could
relate.
in
other
words,
if
that
argument
had
validity
and
every
witness
summoned
in
new
york
to
testify,
could
say
i
refuse
to
testify
no
matter
how
thick
the
immunity
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
shout
out
grace
of
mind
to
the
members
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
you
shout
out
that
we
may
obtain
grace
of
mind
even
after
50
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
your
answer.
is
it
that
that
you
would
not
let
such
a
pronouncement
or
announcement
by
the
u.s.
attorney,
affect
the
right
of
the
state
prosecutorial
authorities
to
elicit
the
information
that's
relevant
if
there's
an
immunity
statute
which
compel
the
disclosure
but
you
say
you
would
leave
it
to
the
federal
courts
to
protect
first
the
witness
against
any
infringement
that
the
fifth
amendment
in
their
view
may
have
worked
against
the
use
of
it
in
the
federal
court.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
did
this
general
session?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
that
problem
go
up
to
the
appellate
division,
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
good
deal
of
--
a
lot
of
things
were
done
in
that
inquiry
that
one
wouldn't
regard
a
separate
justification
for
doing
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
that
while
the
answers
which
are
elicited
in
a
state
proceeding
may
be
elicited
whether
the
federal
court
when
ill-use
is
made
of
it,
should
admit
that
evidence
as
a
different
story?
the
fact
--
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
perhaps
maybe
ill-use
may
be
made
in
a
federal
prosecution
of
testimony
elicited
in
a
state
proceeding,
may
be
a
good
reason
why
the
federal
court
will
protect
the
witness
and
use
such
ill-use
is
made
of
it,
there's
no
reason
for
stopping
inquiry
at
the
source
within
the
considered
state
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
counselman-hitchcock
is
a
totally
different
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
the
immunity
wasn't
equal
to
what
was
elicited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
jurisdiction
in
which
his
testimony
is
elicited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
been
introduced
for
half
a
century,
at
least,
longer
than
that,
70
years.
i
should
say
way
back
long
before
the
civil
war
the
--
what
you
call
the
rights
of
legal
dual
sovereignty
theory
or
something
funny
has
been
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
that
shut
off
the
state
--
state
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
particular
circumstances.
and
that's
what
mccray
--
that's
what
mccray
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
mccray
was.
the
particular
circumstances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
protected
you
in
the
use
by
that
tribunal
of
its
power
because
it
wasn't
coextensive
of
what
they
had
a
right
to
protect.
but
i
ask
you,
what
do
you
say
to
the
proposition?
that
while
it
may
well
be
that
misuse
may
be
made
of
what
new
york
rightfully
ask,
rightfully
in
the
sense
that
it's
in
its
jurisdiction,
with
no
reason,
it
will,
perhaps
it's
a
good
reason
for
preventing
the
misuse,
but
it's
no
reason
for
denying
the
state
to
use
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
new
york.
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
new
york.
unless
you
say
we
should
disregard
the
whole
line
of
reasoning
by
which
the
bill
of
rights
so-called
does
not
limit
state
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
either
have
to
apply
it
or
not
to
apply
it.
we
either
must
say
that
a
man
in
a
state
court
can
say
i
invoke
my
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
--
or
we
say
what
this
court
has
said,
you
can't
say
that
to
an
inquiry
of
the
state
court.
you
can
say
some
other
things,
but
you
can't
say
i
invoke
the
limitations
upon
the
states
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
doesn't
limit
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
still
think
the
decisions
of
the
court
are
decisions
of
the
court
until
they're
overruled.
you
may
ask
us
to
overrule
it,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
can
you
ask
us
to
overrule
the
whole
series
of
cases
in
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
--
within
a
few
months
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
one
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
invoked.
and
this
court
may
charge
swift
of
it
within
a
few
months
of
the
people
who
are
present
throughout
the
inquiry,
throughout
the
debate
that
became
the
fourteenth
amendment
within
a
few
months.
and
you
just
said
barron
v.
baltimore.
and
this
court
in
its
decisions
has
kept
on
saying
barron
against
baltimore.
now,
i
understand
and
i
think
it
shocks
me
in
lawyers
asking
us
to
overrule
anything.
indeed,
they
now
think
presumptively
dissent
like
the
rules
of
the
court.
i
belong
to
a
different
generation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
in
crandall
against
nevada
that
remotely
says
we
limit
barron
against
baltimore
or
did
it
say
that
going
from
one
state
to
another
is
the
right
of
an
american
citizen
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
you're
saying
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
clause
absorbs
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
fifth
amendment
gives
you
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
fifth
amendment
is
being
absorbed
either
by
the
due
process
clause
and
the
privilege
of
immunity,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
i
don't
follow
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
take
your
time.
