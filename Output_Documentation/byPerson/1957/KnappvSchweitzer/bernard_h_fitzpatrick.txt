mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
fitzpatrick.
if
the
court
please.
we
are
seeking
to
review
here
a
sentence
of
fine
and
imprisonment
imposed
upon
a
conviction
for
contempt
in
the
court
of
general
sessions
of
new
york
county.
the
court
of
general
sessions
is,
of
course,
our
major
criminal
court
within
the
county
and
it
has
a
pendent
to
it
a
grand
jury.
the
petitioner,
knapp,
is
an
employer
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
as
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
have
cases
under
it,
there
is
this
section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
makes
it
a
crime
for
an
employer
to
pay
to
any
representative
of
a
labor
union
any
money
if
the
enterprise
is
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce.
there
is
no
question
that
this
enterprise
was
in
commerce.
the
grand
jury
asked
the
petitioner
a
series
of
questions.
i
won't
go
through
the
series
at
this
point,
but
i
will
say
that
they
were
directed
to
ascertaining
whether
knapp
had
paid
any
money
to
one
goldberg,
a
labor
organizer
of
his
employees
or
one
goldstein,
another
official
of
the
same
union
which
contracted
with
his
firm.
knapp
declined
to
answer
on
the
grounds
that
the
answers
might
incriminate
him,
this
of
course,
in
the
privacy
of
the
grand
jury,
originally.
and
he
persisted
in
his
refusal
and
the
grand
jury
granted
him
immunity
under
a
new
york
state
statute
providing
as
many
states
do
for
the
grant
of
immunity
in
cases
involving
extortion
and
the
like.
he
still
declined
to
answer,
still
asserting
the
ground
and
he
was
brought
before
the
respondent,
judge
schweitzer,
upon
a
motion
to
instruct
him
to
answer.
now,
at
this
face
of
the
case,
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
and
counsel
interposed
specifically
the
objection
that
his
refusal
to
answer
was
grounded
on
the
liability
of
implication
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
notwithstanding
that
and
over
the
objection
of
counsel
to
that
effect,
the
witness
was
instructed
to
answer
and
ultimately,
since
he
still
persisted
in
his
refusal,
a
motion
was
made
to
punish
him
for
contempt.
upon
the
motion
to
punish
for
contempt,
counsel
again
reiterated
the
objection,
specifically
that
section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act
was
the
matter
involved,
that
under
the
new
york
state
constitution,
of
course,
which
is
in
longer
in
question
before
this
court,
went
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
as
applied
through
the
supremacy
and
through
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
he
was
privileged
to
refuse
to
answer.
that
is
in
short,
a
very
simple
fact
situation
that
we
have
to
deal
with
here.
he
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
30
days
and
a
fine
of
$250
was
imposed
on
him.
now,
the
first
point
that
i
would
like
to
deal
with
is
the
reality
of
the
petitioner's
peril
that
has
been
a
constant
question
not
raised
by
us
but
raised
by
our
opponents
all
the
way
up.
the
questions
which
were
asked
of
this
petitioner
appear
on
page
12
and
13
of
the
record.
i'll
quote
some
of
them.
“now,
who
represented
the
union
in
these
negotiations
leading
to
a
salary
increase?
mr.
knapp
-
do
you
know
a
man
named
philip
goldberg?
mr.
knapp
-
do
you
know
whether
philip
goldberg
is
an
official
of
local
239,
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters?
mr.
knapp
-
on
or
about
october
28th,
1955,
did
you
give
philip
goldberg,
a
representative
of
local
239,
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
the
sum
of
$500?
mr.
knapp
-
i
show
you
this
check
marked
as
an
exhibit
in
the
sum
of
$500
and
ask
you
whether
you
recognize
it.
mr.
knapp
-
on
or
about
october
28th,
1955,
did
you
go
to
the
public
national
bank
and
trust
company
at
149th
street
in
prospect
avenue
and
cashed
this
check,
grand
jury
exhibit
no.
1,
and
received
from
the
bank
a
sum
of
$500?
mr.
knapp
-
do
you
know
a
man
by
the
name
of
samuel
goldstein?
isn't
it
a
fact
that
samuel
goldstein
is
an
official
of
local
239,
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters?
did
you
ever
pay
or
give
any
sum
of
money
to
samuel
goldstein?”
equipped
with
affirmative
answers
to
those
--
that
series
of
questions
any
tyro
of
a
district
attorney
in
the
federal
service
could
draw
an
information
under
section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
yes,
there
is
such
concomitant
offense,
if
your
honor
will
recall,
we
originally
came
up
on
appeal
on
a
question
of
preemption.
you
dismissed
the
appeal
and
allowed
us
to
raise
it.
so,
there
is
no
question
that
the
grand
jury
from
a
purely
state
viewpoint
have
the
right
to
inquire
into
these
things.
i've
said
--
i
remark
that
the
questions
are
such
as
to
bear
directly
on
the
commission
of
a
federal
crime,
not
only
on
the
commission
of
a
federal
crime,
but
on
the
commission
of
the
crime
by
this
witness.
now
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
he
did,
sir.
that
--
that
is
not
in
the
privacy
of
the
jury
room.
he
is
not
represented
by
counsel
at
the
point.
at
the
first
instance
when
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
that
was
specified
and
it
was
reiterated
on
the
motion
to
punish
for
contempt.
now,
unlike
some
other
cases
which
will
be
cited
before
the
court,
there
was
no
geographic
remoteness
here.
this
man
was
right
within
the
geographic
limits
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
in
which
he
could
be
convicted
for
the
very
crime
inquired.
you'll
hear
from
me,
perhaps,
and
from
my
one
of
adversaries,
i'm
certain
of
king
of
the
two
sicilies
against
willcox
where
a
geographic
barrier
existed
where
expedition
proceedings
would
have
been
necessary
to
render
the
witness
liable
to
the
penalties
of
the
sicilian
courts
and
where
anyhow,
the
english
court
didn't
know
what
the
sicilian
law
was.
none
of
that
is
in
this
case.
here
is
the
man
before
a
court
which
is
administering
a
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
he
cites
a
federal
statute
which
puts
him
in
peril.
that
federal
statute
is
as
much
domestic
law
within
the
state
of
new
york
as
any
law
passed
by
its
own
legislature.
and
the
district
attorney
who
is
supposed
to
prosecute
him
by
duty
bound
to
prosecute
him
under
the
federal
law
is
perhaps
three
blocks
away.
nor
is
there
any
unusual
process
here.
you'll
hear
from
my
adversaries,
i
believe,
about
queen
--
queen
against
boyes
where
an
english
--
in
an
english
court
a
man
who
had
been
--
was
a
recipient
of
the
queen's
pardon
was
made
to
testify
despite
his
plea
that
the
queen's
pardon
could
not
override
a
possible
parliamentary
impeachment.
now,
there
was
a
use
of
a
--
suggested
use
of
a
very
dormant
legal
weapon.
here,
we
have
a
vivid,
alive
prosecutor
set
to
use
the
law
of
the
united
states
by
the
normal
process
of
information
and
indictment.
not
only
that
but
under
the
holding
in
the
feldman
case
of
this
court,
the
testimony
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
give
would
be
usable
verbatim
and
we
do
not
question
the
soundness
of
the
feldman
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
were
it
not
for
the
feldman
case,
we
would
not
be
here.
so
that,
the
proximity
of
the
peril
is
as
great
as
any
proximity
that
a
man
questioned
in
our
federal
district
court
on
the
same
subject
might
be
subjected.
in
that
circumstance,
we
resorted
to
the
fifth
amendment.
the
substance
of
that,
the
part
that
we
invoked
of
course
reads,
“no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.”
now,
at
the
very
minimum,
that
criminal
case
there
means
a
federal
criminal
case,
that
is
that
the
individual
shall
not
be
subjected
in
any
federal
criminal
case
to
the
compulsion
of
giving
testimony
against
himself.
that
is
his
primary
right.
his
primary
right
is
not
so
much
a
right
to
refuse
to
testify
as
it
is
the
right
to
protect
himself
from
prosecution
based
upon
compelled
testimony.
and
we
know
that
because
in
all
the
circumstances
where
his
criminal
liability
is
aborted,
such
as
where
an
immunity
statute
is
operative
and
he's
given
immunity,
or
where
a
pardon
has
taken
away
the
criminal
block,
or
where
the
statute
of
limitations
has
grown
against
a
particular
crime
involved,
and
all
those
circumstances
and
several
others,
the
privilege
disappears.
now,
the
privilege
to
testify
therefore
is
ancillary
to
that
primary
right
and
that
primary
right
is
a
federal
right.
the
right
that
we
are
asserting
here
is
a
right
which
is
ancillary
--
it's
true
whether
it's
ancillary
to
this
man's
right
to
protect
himself
from
federal
prosecution
by
declining
to
testify.
that
ancillary
right,
of
course,
extends
beyond
a
person
proceeded
against,
it
extends
to
a
witness.
it
extends
to
a
person
in
civil
proceedings
called
as
a
witness.
it
extends
to
a
person
before
congressional
committees
and
the
court
has
had
many
of
them
here
in
recent
years.
committees
where
the
function
is
purely
inquisitorial,
no
thought
of
prosecution
exists.
the
committee
of
congress
or
any
similar
legislative
body
does
not
have
the
power
to
indict
or
to
initiate
prosecution.
nevertheless,
a
witness
is
there
entitled
to
assert
that
he
need
not
testify
where
the
circumstances
might
incriminate
him.
now,
we
infer
from
that
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
created
in
the
individual,
a
right
and
it
is
our
assertion
that
no
state
may
by
affirmative
action
interfere
with
his
exercise
of
that
right.
the
right
is
exclusively
addressed
to
the
action
--
possible
action
of
a
federal
prosecutor,
but
it
can,
of
course,
be
interfered
with
by
the
state
authorities.
they
can
put
him
on
the
stand,
they
can
produce
a
line
of
testimony
which
can
be
used
to
his
condemnation
by
the
federal
prosecutor
and
it
can
be
used
verbatim.
now,
if
that
right
follows
him,
not
only
into
the
civil
courts,
not
only
into
administrative
bodies,
not
only
into
the
halls
of
congress
itself,
why
does
it
stop
at
the
state
line
has
the
respondent's
contempt?
the
answer
they
give
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
binding
on
the
states
and
as
applied
to
testimonial
matters,
there
is
a
two
sovereignties
doctrine,
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
which
renders
the
state
so
independent
of
the
federal
government
that
it
need
not
respect
the
right
here
asserted.
now,
it
is
true
that
barron
against
baltimore
held
that
the
federal
bill
of
rights
as
such
was
not
applicable
to
the
states.
but
that
is
not
the
position
that
we
are
contending
here
--
for
here.
we
do
not
take
the
position
here
that
the
states
must
grant
in
the
administration
of
their
own
domestic
affairs,
parallel
protections.
that
is
the
framers
of
the
constitution
have
not
in
the
fifth
--
the
first
10
amendments
written
a
super
constitution
from
the
state,
for
the
states
which
binds
them
in
all
their
domestic
affairs.
all
we
are
contending
is
the
limited
view
that
where
a
federal
function
is
involved,
the
state
has
no
right
to
interfere.
from
barron
against
baltimore,
we
take
the
argument
to
crandall
against
nevada.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
tax
--
a
tax
levied
upon
egress
from
nevada,
a
passenger
transit
tax
levied
upon
egress
from
nevada
was
held
void
by
this
court
for
the
reason
that
it
interfered
with
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states.
it
interfered
with
their
right
among
other
things
to
petition
the
government,
since
in
many
cases
to
effectively
petition
the
government,
you
have
to
leave
nevada.
in
that
sense,
it
has
been
held
that
the
states
are
in
the
position
where
they
can
affirmatively
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
a
federal
right
under
the
first
10
amendments
and
it
is
our
assertion
that
this
--
this
case
now
before
the
bar
is
just
such
a
case.
we
offer
some
analogies
which
may
not
be
too
fanciful.
we
say
that
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
--
on
the
position
of
respondents
here,
they
would
have
to
maintain,
that
for
instance,
that
the
state
could
levy
a
tax
on
a
demand
for
a
federal
jury
trial
in
a
civil
case,
a
right
which
is
protected
by
one
of
the
first
10
amendments.
we'd
say
that
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
put
a
heavy
tax
on
the
furnishing
of
bail
in
a
federal
court
as
such.
in
other
words,
what
we
are
contending
for
is
that
very
limited
functional
application
of
the
first
10
amendments
among
them
the
fifth,
which
merely
holds
that
the
state
is
powerless
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
by
an
individual
of
a
right
which
hinges
upon
his
relationship
to
the
federal
government
and
the
right
here
hinges
upon
such
a
relationship.
now,
let
me
speak
for
a
moment
on
the
so-called
dual
sovereignty
doctrine.
this
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
got
its
start
in
a
rather
side
comment
and
over
the
dicta
of
the
court
in
brown
against
walker.
i
may
say
that
we
do
not
assail
brown
against
walker,
which
has
been
recently
reaffirmed
by
the
court,
we
accept
it.
but
brown
against
walker
was
a
case
which
was
decided
on
the
supremacy
theory.
the
immunity
statute
which
lay
at
the
foundation
of
that
case
was
held
to
bar
state
action.wherefore,
the
plea
of
brown
on
his
habeas
corpus
had
to
be
denied.
however,
the
court
unfortunately
made
a
reference
there
which
i
shall
not
now
quote,
to
the
distinctness
of
the
sovereignties,
the
state
and
federal.
now,
i
might
say
that
prior
to
brown
and
walker,
the
only
decided
case
of
a
consequence
was
united
states
against
saline
bank
and
that
was
a
bill
of
discovery
in
a
federal
district
court
to
which
a
special
plea
was
put
in
to
the
effect
that
the
answers
to
the
bill
of
discovery
would
tend
to
incriminate
the
defendants
under
the
law
of
virginia,
and
that
plea
was
sustained.
in
other
words,
the
federal
courts
were
not
going
about
compelling
answers
to
questions
which
would
prove
incriminating
in
the
state
jurisdictions.
of
course,
brown
against
walker
was
no
departure
from
that.
it
recognized
that
an
immunization
by
the
federal
government
was
sufficiently
plenary
to
bar
all
the
prosecution
involved.
now,
in
the
1905
term,
there
were
three
cases
decided,
hale
against
henkel,
walman
against
fagan,
and
jack
against
kansas.
the
heavy
reliance
of
our
adversaries
is
on
jack
against
kansas.
that
was
a
case
which
came
up
from
the
kansas
courts
and
it
grew
out
of
an
investigation
by
kansas
into
infractions
of
the
local
antitrust
laws,
the
sale
of
coal
within
a
particular
county
in
kansas.
this
court
held
that
it
had
nothing
before
it
which
showed
that
any
matter
of
interstate
commerce
was
involved.
therefore,
a
plea
of
possible
incrimination
on
the
federal
law
would
not
operate
as
a
bar
to
the
kansas
questions.
in
other
words,
they
held
in
substance
that
the
record
was
not
adequate
to
support
the
claim
of
federal
incrimination
because
no
question
would
be
asked
concerning
interstate
commerce.
of
course,
you
might
say
that
that
was
decided
at
a
day
when
the
separation
between
interstate
and
state
--
and
intrastate
commerce
was,
perhaps,
more
marked
than
it
is
today.
however,
while
this
court
held
to
that
effect,
it
again
reiterated
some
of
the
dual
sovereignty
language
which
originated
in
brown
against
walker.
but
at
the
same
term,
walman
against
fagan
was
decided.
that
was
a
case
where
before
a
federal
grand
jury,
a
witness
successfully
pleaded
that
his
answers
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
under
the
bucket
shop
laws
of
ohio
and
its
plea
was
sustained
here.
and
hardly
enough,
one
of
the
cases
cited
to
sustain
his
plea
was
the
very
case
that
we've
just
mentioned,
jack
against
kansas.
hale
against
henkel,
again,
itself
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
supremacy
clause.
that
related
to
the
production
of
documents
and
while
the
key
point
was
whether
a
corporation
or
whether
an
officer
could
plea
the
right
of
the
corporation
to
avoid
self-incrimination.
nonetheless,
the
subordinate
point
was
that
there
might
be
incriminating
matter
on
the
state
law.
the
court,
relying
on
brown
against
walker,
decided
that
on
a
supremacy
basis
but
again
reiterated
some
of
the
dual
sovereignty
language
and
it
made
an
error
as
to
the
english
law.
let
me
advert
to
the
english
law
for
a
minute.
the
leading
case
cited
by
the
adversaries
here
is
king
of
the
two
sicilies
against
willcox.
that
was
an
english
discovery
proceeding
brought
for
the
ultimate
recovery
of
some
vessels
which
apparently
had
been
taken
in
the
course
of
the
revolution
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
or
they'd
come
to
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
defendants.
the
defendants
pleaded
the
possibility
of
incrimination
under
sicilian
law
and
the
vice-chancellor
did
not
honor
their
plea
holding
that
sicilian
law
was
too
far
away,
holding
that
unless
they
voluntarily
return
to
sicily,
they
were
not
exposed,
holding
that
in
any
event
he
didn't
know
what
the
english
law,
what
the
sicilian
law
was
and
therefore,
he
couldn't
be
expected
to
sustain
a
plea
on
that
basis.
however,
in
united
states
against
mccray,
king
of
the
two
sicilies
against
willcox
was
specifically
overruled.
now,
the
mccray
case
grew
out
of
our
own
civil
war.
mccray
was
the
english
fiscal
representative
of
the
confederacy,
and
after
the
war
claiming
as
successor
of
the
confederacy,
we
brought
a
bill
of
discovery
against
mccray.
mccray,
in
the
english
court
--
court
of
appeal,
successfully
pleaded
incrimination
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
so
that
the
english
--
the
hale
against
henkel
case
starts
the
error
as
to
the
english
law
but
believing
that
based
on
king
of
the
two
sicilies
against
willcox.
now,
that
error
is
important
because
it
appears
again
in
the
next
federal
--
in
the
next
united
states
case
decide,
that
is
united
states
against
murdock.
they
repeat
king
of
the
two
sicilies
against
willcox
and
either
never
saw
or
they
did
see
it,
ignored
the
overruling
united
states
against
mccray.
the
murdock
case
was
a
failure
to
furnish
tax
information
to
the
internal
revenue
department
and
a
special
plea
was
taken
there
to
which
a
demurrer
was
had
and
this
court
sustained
in
effect
to
demur.
in
other
words,
compelling
murdock
to
answer,
although,
his
testimony
would
expose
him
to
prosecution
under
the
gambling
laws
of
illinois.
now,
it
refers
--
the
murdock
case
refers
to
the
supremacy
clause.
it
says,
“investigations
for
federal
purposes
may
not
be
prevented
by
matters
depending
upon
state
law,
constitution
article
6,
section
2.”
but
here
it
comes
out
with
the
dual
sovereignty
principle
full
blown.
the
principle
established
is
that
full
and
complete
immunity
against
prosecution
by
the
government
compelling
the
witness
to
answer
is
equivalent
to
the
protection
furnished
by
the
rule
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
now,
there
you
have
the
doctrine.
the
doctrine
was
followed
in
the
feldman
case.
now,
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
result
in
the
feldman
case.
that
was
an
instance
in
which
in
a
judgment
creditors
proceeding
in
new
york,
facts
were
adduced
showing
the
party
guilty
of
mail
fraud
and
they
were
used,
as
was
his
testimony,
verbatim
against
him
to
convict
him
of
mail
fraud
in
a
federal
court.
the
new
york
court
had
elicited
the
testimony
from
him
under
an
immunity
statute.
feldman
did
not,
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
plead
any
involvement
with
federal
law.
in
other
words,
he
did
not
assert
before
the
new
york
court
any
federal
right.
now,
if
all
that
feldman
did,
the
feldman
case
did
was
to
hold
that
the
state
of
new
york
cannot
immunize
against
a
federal
crime,
we
would
have
no
quarrel
with
it.
but
in
the
language
of
feldman
case,
the
dual
sovereignties
doctrine
is
picked
up
and
reiterated
much
in
the
language
that
i
have
read
to
you
from
murdock.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
murdock
is
specifically
cited.
so,
here
we
are
with
the
last
in
the
series
of
cases
or
the
latest
in
the
series
of
cases
and
we
have
a
doctrine
which
started
out
by
being
dicta
in
cases
properly
decided.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
said
to
my
associate
before
i
came
in
here.
i'm
not
trying
to
get
the
court
really
to
overturn
any
decision.
i'm
get
--
i'm
here
to
get
them
to
straighten
out
50
years
of
loose
talk.
there
is
hardly
any
of
the
decisions
in
the
whole
line
which
cannot
be
supported
on
an
adequate
basis,
usually,
the
basis
of
federal
supremacy;
that
is
that
where
testimony
is
compelled
federally,
the
state
court
is
obliged
to
accept
the
result
of
the
federal
immunization.
now,
that
was
your
holding
in
adams
against
maryland,
of
course,
under
specific
statute
preventing
the
use
of
evidence.
the
two
sovereignties
doctrine
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
bohlman?
that
we
hold
is
a
case
in
our
favor,
i
cited
it.
that
was
the
case
where
the
bucket
shop
operator
success
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
the
ohio
case.
he
successfully
pleaded
before
a
federal
grand
jury
his
involvement
under
the
bucket
shop
laws
of
ohio
and
that
this
court
sustained
that
plea.
as
your
honor,
thinking
of
the
possible
consequence
of
the
bohlman
case
as
whether
assuming
that
the
federal
court
had
made
him
answer,
he
could
have
successfully
pleaded
in
the
state
court
a
privilege
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
[laughs]
we
get
much
comfort
out
of
the
language.
but
the
problem
of
course
is
not
simple,
when
you
have
the
adverse
of
the
problem
that
we
--
that
we
have
here.
the
only
case
which
has
reached
this
court
involving
a
claim
of
federal
incrimination
under
state
law
is
jack
against
kansas.
and
that,
of
course,
is
our
main
target.
not
as
i
say
in
the
sense
that
we
are
even
attacking
the
holding
because
there
was
no
adequate
support
for
the
federal
claim
in
the
record
in
that
case.
here,
our
record,
i
think,
supports
our
claim
very
much
better
than
the
--
that
in
jack
case.
now,
let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
this
dual
sovereignty
doctrine.
it
appears
to
be
an
anomaly
as
well
as
a
fallacy.
that
is
to
say
no
other
field
of
our
jurisprudence
have
we
developed
a
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
other
than
the
double
jeopardy
cases
and
self-incrimination
cases.
and
even
in
those
cases,
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
is
applied
only
where
the
party
stands
naked
and
alone
in
his
reliance
on
the
constitution
where
you
have
a
statutory
intervention
such
as
you
had
in
adams
against
maryland
and
the
supremacy
doctrine
takes
its
place.
so
that
in
addition
to
which
relates
its
foundation
on
the
english
law,
in
addition
to
its
being
the
outgrowths
of
dicta
in
the
cases
with
no
actual
decision
and
no
necessity
for
decision,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine
is
an
anomaly
as
well.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
did
not
hear
the
question,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
don't
think
i
said
that.
i
know
that
it
was
referred.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
well,
i
believe
that
you
did
--
your
honor
did
cite
the
mccray
case
in
feldman.
what
i
did
point
out
was
that
up
to
the
point
where
this
doctrine
emerged
full
blown
in
murdock,
there
was
an
ignoring
of
the
mccray
case.
now,
i
don't
quite
remember
your
treatment
of
the
mccray
case
so
i
(voice
overlap)
comment
further.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
now,
our
contention
is
two-fold,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
at
bar
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
petitioner
here
has
a
right
which
is
federal
in
character,
which
hinges
upon
its
relationship
to
the
federal
government,
which
grows
out
of
a
federal
relationship
to
a
relationship
of
an
employer
and
interstate
commerce,
and
that
no
state
can
take
his
shield
away
from
him.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
think,
your
honor,
said
that
a
little
bit
loosely.
i
think
i
agree
with
the
idea
basically.
i
think
that
state
is
powerless
unless
congress
consents
to
immunize
against
federal
crime.
but
that
would
not
necessarily
render
a
state
statute
void.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
adversaries
here
go
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
attacking
the
new
york
state
immunity
statute.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
those
statutes.
we
--
we're
not
even
in
a
position
--
we
have
no
standing
to
attack
them
before
this
court.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
they
are
inadequate
for
the
situation.
they're
simply
ineffectual
and
hence,
immaterial
that
they
neither
advances
nor
retard
as
in
our
pursuit
of
the
federal
right.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
would
think
so,
sir,
but
i
was
simply
trying
to
answer
the
arguments
based
on
the
willcox
case.
i
think
i've
concluded
unless
there
are
other
questions.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
have
a
few
items
in
rebuttal.
counsel
has
stated
that
this
is
not
a
federal
case.
if
by
that
of
course
he
means
that
there
is
no
support
in
the
record
for
the
fact
of
involvement
of
this
employer
in
interstate
commerce
that
is
not
the
fact.
that
is
amply
supported
in
the
record.
the
man
is
in
interstate
commerce.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
what
is
tantamount
to
a
concession
of
such
involvement
right
in
the
record.
now,
of
course,
what
makes
for
the
reality
of
the
exposure
in
this
case
is
that
the
federal
and
state
statutes
cover
precisely
the
same
ground.
i
answered
the
chief
justice
the
other
day
to
say
that
we
have
parallel
legislation.
in
the
framework
in
which
i
answered
it,
i
think
that
was
all
right.
but
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
now
to
one
modification
which
--
of
that
statement,
which
has
a
bearing
on
an
argument
of
counsel
here
this
morning
or
this
afternoon.
that
is
that
the
obligation
of
the
citizen
under
the
taft-hartley
act
is
an
absolute
obligation.
it
is
not
the
qualified
obligation
that
you
shall
not
give
money
in
order
to
achieve
a
benefit
as
in
the
case
of
bribery.
it's
an
absolute
obligation
as
to
say
you
may
not
pay
or
deliver
or
agreed
to
pay
or
deliver
under
the
taft-hartley
act
for
any
but
specified
purposes.
the
question
of
the
reason
why
you
gave
particular
money
is
not
relevant
under
the
taft-hartley
act
except
to
the
extent
that
you
are
able
to
establish
that
it
is
one
of
admissive
purposes.
another
point
indulged
in
by
counsel
relates
to
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
minutes.
and
the
statement
was
made
that
mr.
williams
has
no
standing
to
procure
those
minutes
from
the
grand
jury.
in
the
(inaudible)
investigation
into
labor
activities
in
new
york
several
years
ago,
in
the
very
court
in
which
this
happened,
on
application
of
the
committee,
the
court
divulged
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
relative
to
(inaudible),
you
may
recall
the
incident,
and
those
grand
jury
minutes
were
later
read
into
the
record
in
a
televised
version
of
the
committee
hearings.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
the
court
of
general
sessions,
i
believe
it
was
judge
mullen.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
there
was
no
appeal
in
that
case,
sir,
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
may
well
be.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
can't
say
that
i
do,
sir.
i
can't
say
that
i
contribute
that
ever
to
the
federal
district
attorney.
there
has
been
talk
of
the
real
and
substantial
danger
rule.
outside
of
one
case,
which
i
think
is
to
be
ranked
among
legal
curiosa.
the
only
place,
the
only
line
of
cases
in
which
the
real
and
substantial
danger
rule
has
been
invoked,
is
a
line
of
cases
which
relate
to
prosecutions
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
the
single
exception
is
queen
against
boyes.
that
was
an
english
case
in
which
a
party
was
offered
a
--
the
queen's
part
for
defense
and
called
upon
to
testify
and
resisted
testifying
because
of
the
possibility
of
an
impeachment
by
parliament
which
was
not
covered
by
the
king's
party.
i
think
that
that
is
distinctly
among
the
curiosa
of
the
law.
it
represents
the
situation
which
could
hardly
be
parallel
in
the
country
of
this
character.
and
for
the
rest,
the
rule
of
reality
and
substantiality
relates
to
geographical
remoteness
or
remoteness
of
subject
matter
or
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
court,
of
the
law,
of
the
forum
under
which
the
crime
had
been
committed.
it's
successful
application
to
the
type
of
case
where
the
witness
is
within
the
jurisdiction
geographically,
where
he
is
testifying
with
reference
to
facts
incriminating
him
under
a
law
of
which
that
very
court
in
which
he
sits
takes
judicial
notice
is
quite
a
different
problem.
i
think
i
will
advance
the
test
in
the
brief
that
the
test
of
incrimination
under
federal
law
in
a
state
court
ought
to
be
no
more
stringent
than
the
test
of
incrimination
under
a
similar
state
law.
if
you
do
not
adopt
that
test,
you
get
into
such
speculations
as
we
got
into
here
this
morning.
is
mr.
williams
a
diligent
prosecutor?
is
he
a
sportsman-like
prosecutor?
will
he
conceive
his
duty
under
a
statute
as
absolute
as
the
taft-hartley
act
to
prosecute
a
person
whose
testimony
will
all
but
show
him
guilty
under
that
action
if
those
questions
are
answered
in
the
affirmative?
those
are
speculations
on
matters
of
degree
which
neither
this
court
nor
the
lower
courts
should
indulge
here.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
say
that
if
you
adopt
the
view
of
my
adversary,
you
destroy
the
principle
that
was
laid
down
in
counselman
against
hitchcock
and
has
been
followed
uncompromisingly
thereafter.
the
purpose
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
know,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
--
that
is
right.
but
subtending
the
rule
of
counselman
against
hitchcock
is
the
notion
that
a
man
has
a
right,
an
individual
right,
as
expansive
as
the
possibility
of
prosecution.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
the
moment
you
introduce
that
qualification.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
was
not
followed
in
saline
bank
which
was
the
only
case
before
brown
and
walker
which
he
adverted
to
the
court.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
no,
it
shut
off
--
it
shut
off
a
federal
inquiry
where
the
possibility
of
prosecution
existed
in
the
state.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
but
that
was
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
was
not
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
would
assert,
sir,
that
it
is
not
only
the
use
of
testimony
as
such
in
a
court
against
a
person
which
is
obnoxious
under
the
self-incrimination
rule.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
well,
of
course,
i
think
the
position
that
we
--
not
as
broad
as
disregarding,
that
in
this
--
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
well
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
is
precisely
what
i'm
doing.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
let
me
say
that
i
am
asking
you
to
overrule
the
rule
if
it
is
the
rule,
sir.
i
would
not
agree,
as
i've
mentioned,
i
used
the
phrase
“loose
talk”
that
in
any
of
the
cases
it
was
necessary
to
establish
a
rule
such
as
has
been
invoked
against
us
here.
i
pointed
out
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
have
not
asked
the
court
to
overrule
barron
against
baltimore.
i
have
asked
the
court
to
follow
the
implications
of
crandall
against
nevada
as
a
limitation
upon
barron
against
baltimore.
a
notion
that
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it's
said
the
latter,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
said
the
latter,
sir.
but
it
is
also
the
right
of
an
american
citizen
to
decline
to
incriminate
himself
in
such
a
way
that
he
may
be
federally
prosecuted.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
no,
i
have
not.
i
do
not
in
that
argument
advert
to
this
--
necessarily
advert
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
all.
i
advert
to
the
supremacy
clause.
it
is
the
action
of
the
state
in
stripping
me
of
a
federal
right.
it
is
affirmative
interference
by
the
state
with
a
right
granted
me
to
remain
free
of
federal
prosecution
based
upon
my
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
because
the
fifth
amendment
gives
me
that
right,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
no.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
is
not
a
necessary
conclusion.
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
that
question,
sir.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
you
mean
will
there
be
a
substantial
interference
with
the
operation
of
the
new
york
immunity
statutes?
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
think
that
there
will
be
a
substantial
interference
in
certain
areas.
notably,
the
areas
in
which
there
is
parallelism
in
the
legislation
of
the
state
and
of
the
nation.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
think
the
likelihood
of
involvement
as
distinguished
from
the
likelihood
of
use
is
the
question,
sir.
would
a
man
put
himself
in
a
position
where
he
would
be
exposed?
and
not
whether
there
is
a
prosecutor
breathing
actually
--
in
fact,
breathing
down
his
neck.
that's
a
pure
speculation.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
no,
sir.
not
new
york
as
such
except
to
petition
congress
or
to
have
its
representatives
in
congress,
see
to
the
enactment
of
a
proper
statute
giving
new
york
the
power
completely
to
immunize.
that
is
the
fundamental,
i
think,
misapprehension
with
reference
to
this
whole
question.
you
have
deposited
your
power
into
depositories,
one
of
them
state
and
the
other
federal.
if
you
deposit
your
power
to
incriminate
with
the
state,
then
the
state
has
the
power
to
immunize.
if
you
deposit
your
power
to
incriminate
with
the
nation,
then
the
nation
has
the
right
to
immunize
with
reference
to
those
crimes.
to
get
a
complete
immunization,
you
simply
got
to
put
the
two
together
and
a
congressional
statute
is
the
only
way
to
do
that.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
is
not
involved
in
any
constitutional
problem.
that
is
the
mere
application
of
the
local
rule
against
self-incrimination,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
plays
a
part
here
at
this
level.
we
unsuccessfully
urged
it
in
the
state
courts
where
we
had
right
so
to
urge.
now,
the
question
of
due
process
has
come
in
by
the
back
door.
in
the
--
in
coming
up
here,
we
made
an
advocate's
choice
to
come
up
on
the
narrow
ground
on
which
we
did
come
up.
we
did
not
advance
the
notion
of
due
process.
and
we
can't
complain
if
this
court
does
not
entertain
the
subject
matter.
but
if
thereto
behest
to
our
adversaries,
the
subject
matter
is
entertained.
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
what
i
think
is
a
reasonable
implication
from
the
cases
where
the
guide
to
self
--
self-incrimination
with
reference
to
due
process.
my
adversary's
contentions
have
been
based
upon
the
twining
and
adamson
cases
and
the
cases
of
that
here.
they
are
questions
of
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
failure
to
testify
and
things
of
that
sort.
they're
rather
peripheral
applications
of
the
rule
against
self-incrimination.
if
you
take
a
case
like
brown
against
mississippi
where
the
deputy
sheriff
submit
a
confession
of
crime
with
belt
buckles
out
of
an
individual
which
was
later
used
to
convict
him.
there,
this
court
didn't
hesitate
to
hold
that
due
process
was
involved.
and
i
suggest
that
the
distinction
is,
while
as
i
say
these
peripheral
applications
of
the
rule,
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
failure
to
testify
are
not
within
the
ambit
of
due
process.
nevertheless,
the
actual
application
of
compulsion
to
the
production
of
testimony
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
and
i
wanted
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
that
compulsion
is
the
compulsion
of
a
deputy
with
a
belt
buckle
or
a
court
which
threatens
imprisonment
with
a
goal
obtained.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
