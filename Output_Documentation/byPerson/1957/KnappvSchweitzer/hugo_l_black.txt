justice

what
do
you
think
of
the
bohlman
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
base
such
statement
that
is
so
unlikely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
your
proof
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
happen
every
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
all
of
those
cases
--
in
all
known
cases
where
evidence
is
given
by
a
man
in
the
state
court,
he
is
forced
to
give,
has
been
used
against
him
in
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
his
ground
and
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
say
that
the
federal
--
it
can
be
assumed
that
the
federal
authority
would
have
been
able
to
get
that
from
the
state
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
though
--
i
gather
though
that
your
object
was
that
if
he
had
testified
to
get
evidence
that
you
wouldn't
ask
the
next
time
in
the
grand
jury,
but
you'd
ask
in
the
open
courtroom.
and
if
it's
intended
to
incriminate
him,
you
still
say
that
there's
little
likelihood
that
federal
authorities
would
have
used
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
he
have
to
get
the
minutes
(inaudible)?
as
i
understand,
you
didn't
want
(inaudible)
the
person
you
wanted
to
testify
so
that
you
could
use
it
later
to
convict
somebody
on
defense
in
your
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
there's
no
likelihood
that
this
fellow
came
up
to
testify
something
and
discriminate
him
in
the
federal
court?
it
is
not
--
it's
just
a
remote
possibility
that
the
prosecuting
officer
in
the
federal
government
ever
finds
it
out,
usually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
is
it
remote
if
the
federal
--
it's
the
common
practice
for
the
federal
officers
and
the
state
officers
to
discuss
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
criminals,
well-known
criminals
and
they
cooperate
with
one
another
in
that
connection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
isn't
it
also
true
that
frequently
throughout
the
country,
they
will
prosecute
a
man
in
the
federal
court,
but
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
in
the
state
because
of
his
immunity?
they
will
prosecute
a
man
in
the
state
courts,
but
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
in
the
federal
courts
because
of
his
immunity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
that
make?
they
forced
him
to
give
the
evidence?
that
state
forced
him
to
give
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
there
were
two
cases
of
this
court
that
is
going
on
the
assumption
that
you
now
suggest
and
they
wouldn't
hold
that
it
was
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
circumstances
of
feldman
because
they
said
they
couldn't
imagine
that
any
court,
any
prosecutor
would
ever
use
such
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
they
did
do
it
in
feldman.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
suppose
if
congress
would
have
passed
the
statute,
nobody
could
ever
be
prosecuted
for
twice
with
the
same
offense.
that
was
against
(inaudible).
would
that
go
any
further
than
the
constitution
has
already
gone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
against
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
the
mere
facts
that
congress
might
do
something,
settles
your
constitutional
question
here
as
to
whether
the
constitution
forbids
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
just
to
what
extent
is
going
on
now,
but
i
haven't
recalled
during
the
provision
alone,
both
the
federal
authorities
and
state
authorities
would
go
to
the
other
agencies
to
see
if
somebody
had
been
charged
with
violation
prohibition
law
then
try
him
again.
maybe
--
maybe
that
practice
is
over
now
and
they
don't
do
it
in
any
other
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
really
make
any
difference
if
the
constitution
forbids
it
whether
it's
a
common
practice
or
an
uncommon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
denzer,
you
--
there
is
no
comprehensive
immunity
statute
in
new
york.
they're
all
ad
hoc?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unfortunately,
i
didn't
reach
the
contrary
result.
i
reached
the
contrary
argument.
