mr.
fitzpatrick.
justice
harold
burton
speaking
to
your
contention,
how
do
you
describe
what
is
left
of
the
new
york
immunity
statute?
what
is
left?
justice
harold
burton
if
you
can
see
it
in
your
contention,
the
witness
here
is
not
entitled
to
an
immunity.
justice
harold
burton
that's
just
what
i
mean.
justice
harold
burton
wherever
you
could
find
a
federal
statute
that
would
be
enough
or
was
that
in
likelihood
that's
being
used
enough.
justice
harold
burton
is
there
anything
that
new
york
could
do
about
it
to
reinstate
that
immunity?
justice
harold
burton
you
mean
it
has
the
right
to
choose
to
step
farther
for
the
danger
of
prosecution
in
the
federal
statute
and
how
about
the
danger
of
prosecution
under
some
of
the
state?
