justice
john
m.
harlan
when
he
asserted
the
privilege
originally,
did
he
specify
the
taft-hartley
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
adverse
of
it
is
that
you
would
--
a
state
couldn't
pass
any
immunity
statute
as
in
the
area
where
there
was
a
possible
overlap
with
the
federal
field?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
--
supposing
the
united
states
attorney
walked
in
to
your
court
in
general
sessions
and
moved
to
inspect
the
grand
jury
minutes,
your
grand
jury
minutes,
would
he
get
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
divulge
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
to
the
united
states
attorney
without
court
approval?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
suppose
if
congress,
it
is
really
hazard
of
that
without
trespassing
in
any
investigatory
functions
of
the
state
and
pass
a
statute
which
would
prohibit
the
use
of
state-compelled
testimony
which
had
a
federal
impact
in
any
federal
trial.
that
would
leave
you
fellows
free
and
it
wouldn't
--
if
that's
a
serious
danger,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
the
united
states
attorney
has
given
out
a
newspaper
release
saying,
“i'm
going
to
prosecute
every
witness,
every
defendant
that
i
get
to
trail
out
through
a
state
court
proceeding.”
assuming
that's
--
that
he
hadn't
initiated
the
state
court
proceeding,
he
hadn't
done
anything
of
that
kind,
but
that
he
loudly
said
he
was
going
after
these
fellows
in
the
federal
prosecutions
we've
got
through
it.
would
that
affect
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
leaving
out
the
conspiracy.
i'm
leaving
out
--
this
is
a
pure
unilateral
act
of
his
part.
he
hasn't
initiated,
stimulated,
encouraged
the
state
proceedings
in
any
way,
but
he
is
simply
a
vigorous
prosecutor
he
says,
“i'm
ongoing
after
all
these
fellows
in
a
state
--
in
a
federal
prosecution.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
affect
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i'm
asking
about
you,
your
theory
of
the
case.
