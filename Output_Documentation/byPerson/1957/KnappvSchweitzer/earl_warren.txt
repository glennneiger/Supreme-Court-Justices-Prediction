it
doesn't
go
a

the
position
they
take.
doesn't

doesn't
their
position
say
that
if
he
gives
his
testimony,
he
can
be
convicted
in
the
federal
courts
upon
his
own
testimony?
chief

isn't
that
--
that's
a
little
farther
than
--
chief

yes.
chief

yes.
chief

yes,
that's
what
i
--
chief

earl
warren
precisely,
your
honor,
and
there

one
--
one
other
item
on
the
facts,
in
his
brief,
the
petitioner
refers
to
something
which
he
entitles
an
announced
policy
of
cooperation
between
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
and
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
with
respect
to
labor
racketeering
matters.
apparently,
he
derives
that
from
a
newspaper
article
appearing
sometime
before
this
case
in
which
mr.
paul
williams,
the
united
states
attorney,
announced
in
very
general
fashion
that
he
and
mr.
hogan,
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county,
were
going
to
cooperate
in
the
investigation
of
labor
racketeering.
and
from
that,
my
friend
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
concrete
policy
here
which
encompassed
this
particular
case
and
this
particular
witness.
now,
of
course,
that
statements
by
mr.
williams
was
so
general
that
we
contend
that
no
specific
coverage
of
this
case
can
be
predicated
whatsoever.
but
as
i've
already
pointed
out,
even
if
there
were
some
form
of
cooperation
involved,
the
last
thing
that
that
wouldn't
--
that
that
would
entail
would
be
mr.
williams
running
into
our
grand
jury
and
trying
to
charge
one
of
our
witnesses
for
the
crime
based
on
the
testimony
compelled
on
him.
that
would
not
be
cooperation.
that
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
double-cross
(inaudible).
i
don't
think
that
mr.
fitzpatrick
has
much
faith
in
this
so-called
policy
anymore.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
never
raised
either
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding
or
in
a
rather
extensive
proceedings
for
contempt.
it
was
never
advanced
up
to
and
through
the
adjudication
for
contempt
--
of
contempt
in
this
case.
it
didn't
make
its
appearance
until
the
tail
end
of
the
pleadings
in
the
first
quarter
review.
and
while
mr.
fitzpatrick
has
mentioned
it
and
tried
to
imply
its
significance,
i
think,
in
his
brief,
he
didn't
say
a
word
about
it
during
his
oral
argument
here,
and
for
that
reason,
i
don't
believe
that
even
he
has
much
faith
in
that
so-called
policy
anymore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
denzer,
doesn't
your
--
these
arguments
you're
making
now
rest
entirely
on
personalities?
let's
assume
the
situation
that
we
have
here
that
your
district
attorney
whom
you
represent
believes
that
the
target
should
be
labor
racketeers
who
accept
bribes
from
employers.
and
suppose
that
the
united
states
attorney
felt
that
it
was
just
as
bad
for
an
employer
to
give
a
bribe
to
a
labor
racketeer
as
it
was
for
that
person
to
accept
the
bribe.
is
it
unlikely
that
the
complaint
was
made
to
him
that
this
man
had
so
testified
and
was
not
prosecuted
in
the
state
courts
that
--
that
he
would
start
a
prosecution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
minutes
more
mr.
--
until
the
red
light
comes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kurtpatrick
--
fitzpatrick.
