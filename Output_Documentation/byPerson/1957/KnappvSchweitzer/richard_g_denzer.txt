mr.
richard
g.
denzer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
believe
that
i
will
have
any
more
time
than
to
simply
introduce
my
argument
and
declare
what
i
believe
the
issues
are
in
this
case,
but
--
that
is
before
the
closing
today's
session.
unless
certain
very
basic
and
very
well
settled
principles
which
have
been
promulgated
by
this
court
are
to
be
suddenly
overturned
and
entirely
rejected.
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
whatsoever
as
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
my
argument
here
is
very
simple.
simple
because
the
ground
has
been
so
thoroughly
covered
by
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
handed
down
throughout
the
years.
as
i
view
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petitioner
must
establish
two
propositions
and
that
if
he
fails
on
either
of
these,
his
--
failure
to
establish
it,
it
would
be
fatal
to
his
cause.
i
haven't
quite
understood
his
argument
nor
his
ramifications
because
on
the
one
hand,
he
seems
to
rely
upon
the
fifth
amendment
completely
and
then
he
says
that
he
knows
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
states
and
realizes
that
it
is
not,
but
i
have
heard
no
mention
of
his
reliance
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
as
i
say,
as
i
view
this
case,
he
must
establish
these
two
propositions.
first
of
all,
with
the
new
york
state
immunity
provision
with
which
we're
dealing
here
and
its
operation
in
this
case,
has
violated
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
that
privilege
principle
is
understood
and
construed
under
the
fifth
amendment.
in
other
words,
were
this
a
federal
case
rather
than
a
state
case
and
where
we're
dealing
here
with
a
federal
immunity
statute
instead
of
a
state
immunity
statute,
the
contention
would
have
to
be
the
first
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
violated.
but
since
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
applicable
to
or
controlling
upon
the
states,
the
petitioner
must
--
go
much
farther
than
that.
that
is
only
his
first
step.
he's
relegated
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
possibly
to
the
privilege
and
immunities
clause
that
are
more
likely
to
the
due
process
clause.
in
other
words,
he
must
establish
not
only
that
this
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
privilege
provision,
if
this
were
a
federal
case,
but
that,
it's
such
a
heinous
and
such
a
shocking
violation,
one
that
runs
splash
against
--
up
against
all
our
concepts
of
american
justice
and
liberty,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
also.
now,
on
that
first
step
which
he,
if
i'm
correct,
must
take
and
must
successfully
take,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
can
succeed
in
establishing
any
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
decisions.
examining
these
immunity
provisions,
it
should
be
remembered
that
a
state
in
return
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
privilege
and
compelling
a
witness
to
appear
and
testify,
grants
all
the
protection
and
immunity
that
it
possibly
can.
it
has
in
mind
the
admonition
of
counselman
against
hitchcock
where
the
immunity
granted
must
be
as
broad
as
the
privilege
destroyed.
and
by
all
of
the
immunity
and
protection
that
it
can,
we
mean
necessarily,
immunity
from
prosecution
within
the
borders
and
jurisdiction
of
a
state
itself
because
as
the
court
well
know
as
i'm
sure,
no
state
can
grant
protection
beyond
that
either
on
another
state
or
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
we
cannot
control
the
procedure
and
the
rules
of
evidence
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
as
the
court
is
also
well
aware,
i'm
sure,
the
situation
is
somewhat
different
in
the
federal
courts,
that
is,
in
connection
with
federal
immunity
and
the
federal
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
federal
immunity
provisions.
because
of
the
federal
supremacy
clause,
the
congress
may
enact
federal
immunity
provisions
which
extend
protection
not
only
within
the
federal
courts
themselves
that
has
immunity
and
protection
from
criminal
prosecution
in
the
federal
courts,
but
also
protection
from
the
use
of
such
evidence
in
any
criminal
prosecutions
which
might
result
in
a
state
court.
so,
there
is
a
difference
there
only
to
the
federal
supremacy
clause.
now,
these
federal
decisions
are
interesting
here
not
because
they
hit
our
factual
situation
right
on
the
nose,
but
because
they
bring
squarely
into
play
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
remembering
that,
that
is
not
applicable
here,
if
we
can
examine
the
situation
more
minutely
by
first
observing
these
federal
decisions
dealing
with
federal
immunity
provisions.
and
of
course,
i
refer
to
brown
against
walker
and
hale
against
henkel
in
the
main.
i
don't
think
the
brown
case
has
been
accurately
presented
here.
i
don't
think
that
the
issue
decided
or
the
declarations
of
that
case
so
far
as
they're
pertinent
here
have
been
accurately
--
accurately
stated.
and
both
the
brown
case
and
hale
against
henkel,
it
was
claimed
that
the
federal
immunity
provision
in
question
was
inadequate
because
it
did
not
extend
protection
to
the
states.
in
brown
against
walker,
this
court
said
that
that
was
not
so
that
the
particular
statute
there
did
extend
the
protection
to
the
states
beyond
the
federal
jurisdiction.
but
that
is
not
the
important
aspect
of
that
face
of
the
case,
in
both
brown
against
walker
and
hale
against
henkel,
the
court
said
this
but
assuming
that
that's
not
so,
and
assuming
that
the
immunity
is
just
as
limited
as
claimed
by
the
assailant
of
the
statute
in
that
case.
assumed
it's
confined
with
the
federal
jurisdiction,
still,
we
find
no
unconstitutionality
in
the
statute.
we
--
we
find
no
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.we
find
no
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
there
as
i
say,
those
two
cases
whether
you
call
it
dicta
or
a
plot
holding
to
that
effect,
it
seems
to
me
is
not
important
because
of
the
squarely
--
the
hold
--
the
declaration
on
that
point
is
very
direct
and
square,
and
those
two
decisions
have
been
followed
on
that
score
during
--
by
this
court,
during
many
subsequent
opinions
and
decisions.
the
reasoning
behind
the
brown
and
hale
cases
in
that
respect
is
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
two-fold.
first
of
all,
we
have
what
mr.
fitzpatrick
has
termed,
the
dual
sovereignty
doctrine,
and
that
is
merely
to
the
effect
that
when
we
view
an
immunity
statute
of
this
nature
in
view
of
its
operation,
we
must
regard
a
state
and
a
federal
jurisdiction
as
two
separate
and
distinct
sovereignties,
that
an
immunity
and
protection
becomes
sufficient
under
those
circumstances
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
to
any
other
aspect
of
this
case,
i'd
like
to
touch
upon
two
pages
of
it
which
in
my
opinion
made
considerable
clarification.
one
of
those
is
the
factual
situation
and
the
other
is
the
rather
peculiar
nature
of
the
petitioner's
contention
here.
now
as
to
the
facts,
this
was
of
course
a
new
york
county
in
new
york
state
grand
jury
investigation
into
the
question
of
whether
certain
labor
union
representatives
had
received
criminal
payments
from
certain
businessmen.
i
say
criminal,
meaning,
criminal
either
by
way
of
extortion
or
a
bribe
receiving.
the
line
between
extortion
and
bribe
receiving
is
sometimes
rather
thin
and
was
not
known
precisely
what
the
nature
of
these
payments
would
be
assuming
they
could
be
established
by
the
interrogation
in
the
grand
jury.
it
was
pursuant
to
this
investigation
that
this
witness,
this
petitioner,
was
called
and
was
asked
whether
he
had
made
certain
of
such
payments
to
two
union
--
labor
union
representatives
named
goldberg
and
goldstein.
he
refused
to
answer
those
questions
on
the
privilege
ground
and
that's
why
we're
here
today.
now,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
this
petitioner
is
not
a
racketeer
and
not
an
underworld
character.
he's
a
businessman.
he
was
not
the
target
of
this
investigation.
he
was
not
a
prospective
defendant
here.
he
was
purely
a
witness.
the
grand
jury's
and
the
state
prosecutor's
purpose,
of
course,
nevertheless
to
construct
a
criminal
case
or
criminal
charges
against
this
person
at
all.
that's
pretty
obviously
so
because,
otherwise,
we
would
not
have
called
him
as
a
witness
and
offered
him
complete
immunity
in
our
courts
from
all
prosecution
for
or
on
account
of
anything
which
he
might
say
there.
i
also
want
to
stress
that
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
this
case
to
support
the
implication.
in
my
--
one
of
the
adversary's
arguments
on
thursday
that
this
case
was
permeated
with
federal
ramifications.
there
wasn't
any
federal
flavor
to
this
grand
jury
inquiry
whatsoever
and
the
word
federal
has
been
injected
here
only
by
virtue
of
the
argument
which
has
been
made
in
this
court
and
some
of
the
courts
below.
the
way
the
investigation
was
described
by
my
friend
when
gathered
the
impression
that
the
taft-hartley
law
was
always
a
factor
here,
and
that
you
could
almost
see
a
plaque
residing
it
on
the
grand
jury
room
wall.
and
that
the
federal
prosecutor
whose
office
was
graphically
described
as
three
blocks
down
the
street,
whatever
difference
that
might
make,
was
somehow
lurking
outside
the
grand
jury
room
ready
to
pounce
upon
this
witness.
well,
that
of
course
was
not
the
situation
at
all.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
in
this
case,
no
suggestion
of
any
interest
by
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
or
any
other
federal
agency
of
any
interest
in
this
petitioner.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
just
a
kind
of
case
in
which
one
would
be
least
likely
to
find
an
interest
by
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
local
federal
prosecutor
of
the
district
because
as
i've
pointed
out,
this
witness
is
not
a
target.
he
is
someone
whom
we
hope
to
use
against
the
targets,
against
the
labor
leaders
whom
--
whom
might
be
described
as
prospective
defendants
and
who
were
actually
indicted
on
other
charges.
and
any
cooperation,
so
to
speak,
by
the
federal
prosecutor
could
certainly
not
take
the
form
of
leaping
into
the
middle
of
our
case
and
prosecuting
one
of
our
witnesses
upon
whom
we
were
relying
upon
for
evidence
against
the
main
targets.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
if
he
had
been
summoned
before
a
federal
grand
jury,
the
fifth
amendment
of
course
would
then
be
applicable.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
it
would
be
called
into
play
if
he
was
summoned
before
a
federal
grand
jury.yes,
where
we
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
because
then
of
course
he
would
be
in
a
federal
forum
where
--
which
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
only
place
where
the
fifth
amendment
is
--
does
come
into
play.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
no.
there
was
no
reference
made
to
--
none
whatsoever.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
any
interest
by
the
--
by
the
federal
authorities
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that's
the
contention
that
has
been
made
here.
i
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
i
think
it
comes
down
to
a
question
of
due
process,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
we
can
even
talk
about
the
fifth
amendment
as
long
as
we're
in
a
new
york
state
forum.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
the
issue.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
that's
--
that's
what
they
claim
the
unfairness
is
here.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
that's
the
asserted
unfairness
in
this
case
that
it
might
lead
to
a
federal
conviction
on
the
basis
of
the
state-compelled
evidence.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
that
is
their
--
their
factual
claim,
so
to
speak.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
wish
you'd
ask
him
to
what,
sir?
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
oh
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
there
would
be
no
danger
of
any
federal
prosecution
whatsoever
there
i
think,
your
honor,
because
of
the
doctrine
which
appears
in
your
honors
own
opinion
in
feldman
against
the
united
states
which
declares
that
where
such
a
conspiracy,
so
to
speak,
and
i
think
you
could
call
that
does
exist
in
where
the
state
prosecutor
is
being
used
as
a
tool
more
or
less
by
the
federal
prosecutor
to
unearth
evidence
for
federal
use,
then
the
evidence
is
not
admissible
in
the
federal
court
at
all.
and
so,
taking
the
situation
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
there,
he
would
be
in
no
danger
whatsoever
of
federal
prosecution
on
the
basis
of
that
testimony.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
in
feldman
against
the
united
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
no.
i
say
he
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
say
he
could
not
use
--
he
could
not
use
it
because
i
think
that's
explicitly
stated
in
feldman
against
united
states.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
again,
i
say
that
feldman
against
the
united
states
would
control
there
that
the
law
would
then
be
that
anything
that
he
did
say
could
not
be
used
against
him,
so
i
don't
think
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
refuse
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
say
that
where
you
have
the
explicit
situation
and
actual
conspiracy,
there
cannot
be
any
danger
whatsoever
and
that
apart
from
that,
the
situation
or
the
possibility
is
so
unlikely
that
that
can
virtually
be
discarded
as
a
realistic
peril.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
no,
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
--
i
know
of
no
cases
really
where
it
has
happened.
of
course,
you
can't
produce
statistics
on
this
or
proof.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
know
that
feldman
against
the
united
states
is
the
only
one
that
i
am
aware
of
and
that
was
not
a
criminal
state
proceeding.
that
was
a
--
i
think
a
motion
or
a
discovery
proceeding.
and
anyway,
it
was
a
civil
proceeding
and
their
course
was
no
cooperation
there
between
united
states
attorney
and
the
interrogator.
but
in
this
particular
situation,
i
think
you
would
--
you
have
the
least
likely
possibility
of
any
future
federal
use.
as
i
say,
we
are
dealing
with
a
witness
here
not
with
the
defendant.
in
the
first
place,
it's
possible
that
the
evidence
concerning
these
payments
even
if
it
had
been
given,
would
not
even
involve
the
witness
in
a
crime
at
all.
as
i've
said
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
that's
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
all
right.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
the
practice
and
the
realities
of
the
situation,
your
honor,
the
united
states
attorney
might
be
interested
in
the
targets
of
our
investigation.
the
labor
racketeers
whom
we
were
trying
to
--
against
whom
we
were
trying
to
make
charges
of
extortion
or
bribery,
it's
hardly
likely
that
the
united
states
attorney
would
come
into
our
grand
jury,
so
to
speak,
try
to
get
evidence
against
one
of
our
witnesses
whom
we
ourselves
never
had
any
intention
to
press,
you
know,
whom
we
didn't
regard
as
a
target
of
any
investigation
and
seek
to
prosecute
the
very
person
upon
whom
we
are
relying
to
obtain
evidence
against
the
real
culprits.
i
say
that's
an
extremely
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
do,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
reality
and
practice,
that
just
doesn't
happen.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
i
speak
from
observation
in
many
years
of
the
procedures
involved
here.
now,
we
would
no
more
think
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
in
the
district
attorney's
office.
i
don't
know
whether
you're
asking
for
my
personal
experience.
i
have
that
point
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
personal
--
personal
experience
and
observation
for
20
years
in
the
district
attorney's
office,
we
simply
--
from
our
point
of
view,
for
example,
we
simply
do
not
go
over
poking
around
for
--
in
the
federal
grand
jury
minutes
if
we
could
get
hold
of
them,
poking
around
and
trying
to
make
cases
against
witnesses
who
have
assisted
the
federal
prosecutor
in
making
cases
against
the
real
culprits.
we
do
not
do
that.
we
would
regard
that
as
gross
and
flagrant
interference.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
bring
a
motion
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
no,
we
could
not,
your
honor.
that
--
that
is
another
point
here.
our
new
york
statutes
cloaked
these
grand
jury
minutes
in
secrecy.
they
placed
them
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
general
sessions.
and
while
there
is
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
disclose
them,
they're
very
reluctant
to
do
so
and
they
have
in
mind
that
spirit
of
secrecy
which
is
behind
the
legislation
which
i
have
mentioned.
and
so,
it
would
be
very
dubious
in
any
event
whether
the
federal
prosecutor
could
get
hold
of
the
minutes
if
he
wanted
to.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
only
under
certain
circumstances.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
he
--
he
can
move.
the
federal
prosecutor
will
have
no
stand
to
move
to
inspect
the
grand
jury
minutes
in
that
court,
whether
he
could
obtain
them
by
a
subpoena,
i
don't
know.
that
would
bring
in
other
problems,
but
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
and
dubious
task
of
possibility
at
best.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
that's
right.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
didn't
say
remote
that
they
would
ever
find
it
out,
your
honor,
but
certainly
very
remote
that
they
would
ever
use
it.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
maybe
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
not
arising
out
of
this
kind
of
situation,
your
honor.
there
may
be
cooperation
in
attempting
to
charge
the
culprits
against
whom
their
efforts
are
directed.
that
means
in
this
case,
two
men
named
goldberg
and
goldstein.
it
does
not
mean
the
witnesses
who
are
cooperating
with
one
or
the
other.
and
the
last
thing
the
cooperation
would
involve,
and
the
last
thing
i'm
sure
mr.
williams
would
do
in
this
case,
when
we
were
trying
to
use
a
witness
to
obtain
testimony
against
the
real
culprits
and
when
we
were
willing
to
offer
immunity,
when
we
showed
we
have
no
interest
at
all
and
to
us
he
was
truly
a
witness
from
whom
we
want
a
testimony.
the
last
thing
in
the
world,
i'm
sure
that
mr.
williams
would
do,
would
try
to
prosecute
this
man
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
which
we
compelled.
now,
i
note
towards
certainty
that
we
would
never
do
that
in
a
reverse
situation.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
that's
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
there
was
a
great
deal
in
that,
your
honor.
the
minute
you
have
prosecutors
from
different
jurisdictions
enmeshing
their
activities,
one
trying
to
do
one
thing
and
another
with
the
same
case,
you'll
get
havoc
and
embezzlement.
and
we
just
haven't
that
problem
or
that
situation.
i'm
--
i'm
very
certain
that
that
is
the
situation
throughout
the
united
states.
and
i
--
i
just
haven't
heard
of
any
case
which
embodies
the
dangers
of
the
anxieties
that
have
been
raised
here.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
feldman,
as
i
pointed
out,
your
honor,
was
not
--
was
not
a
criminal
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
they
--
they
did
do
it
feldman.
and
as
i
said
before,
you
might
get
rare
instances
of
that,
but
that
is
not
comparable
to
the
present
situation
where
you
have
prosecutors.
and
for
the
reasons
i've
been
describing
here,
that
just
doesn't
happen
between
federal
and
state
prosecutors.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well
certainly,
in
other
words,
the
statute
overruling
feldman
against
the
united
states,
i'd
take
it's
what
you
mean
because,
of
course,
it
is
not
our
state
provisions
that
render
this
evidence
admissible
in
the
federal
courts.
it
is
the
federal
rule
of
evidence
as
enunciated
in
feldman
against
the
united
states
that
permits
the
use
of
the
testimony.
and
of
course,
if
that
were
overruled
by
statute
or
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
problem
at
all
here
because
the
evidence
could
never
be
used.
but
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
on
the
petitioner's
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
maybe.
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
settle
it.
no.
as
of
the
present
time
that
is
the
rule
in
feldman
against
the
united
states,
but
our
position
as
to
the
danger
is
one
as
the
cases
have
held,
as
it
was
held
in
jack
against
kansas
that
this
type
of
situation
does
not
create
any
real
and
substantial
danger.
and
i
think
that's
just
true
of
the
present
case
as
it
was
in
jack
against
kansas.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
can't
be
specific
about
anything
that
happened
in
the
prohibition
cases,
your
honor.
i
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
as
things
are
constituted
now
and
from
my
experience,
i
haven't
heard
of
any
cases
where
the
state
prosecutor
compelled
evidence
from
a
witness
and
then
the
federal
prosecutor
came
running
in
to
get
it.
that
is
in
the
absence
of
any
conspiratorial
conduct
between
them.
it
seems
to
me,
if
there
is
a
burden
or
showing
factual
situations
along
those
lines
that
does
not
necessarily
rest
on
me,
that
is
if
there
is
to
be
an
argument
made
here,
that
this
is
a
very
common
practice,
i
think
the
burden
rests
to
the
petitioner
to
show
that.
and
he
has
certainly
shown
nothing
to
that
effect
thus
far.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
i
think
it
makes
a
difference,
your
honor.
of
course,
no
rule
works
perfectly,
i
suppose.
but
if
it's
an
extremely
rare
instance,
i
think
we
must
have
some
regard
through
reality
in
a
sense
that
our
immunity
provisions
are
very
valuable
assets.
they're
--
they're
extremely
solitary
in
the
prosecution,
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
there.
we
have
about
50
of
them
alone.
they're
scattered
throughout
the
states
in
great
numbers.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
a
tragic
blow
to
the
administration
of
criminal
law
and
criminal
justice
if
they
were
to
be
emasculated,
so
to
speak,
on
this
vague,
very
rare
possibility
that
a
federal
case
might
somehow
result
from
this
type
of
activity.
i
thought
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
that's
right,
your
honor.
except
there
was
a
statute
passed
in
the
last
few
years
which
changed
that
in
the
procedure
with
respect
to
all
of
the
provisions.
but
generally
speaking,
we
have
them
in
different
areas
of
law.
that
is
the
different
areas
of
crime.
and
they're
--
of
course
they're
enacted
to
cover
those
areas
where
obtaining
evidence
from
tainted
witnesses,
the
accomplice
sort
of
witness,
is
most
necessary,
and
where
you
practically
cannot
succeed
in
bringing
any
charges
or
making
a
case
without
these
immunity
statutes.
that's
the
only
way
we
have
of
obtaining
this
kind
of
evidence.
and
if
we
--
if
we
aren't
able
to
obtain
it,
why,
if
we
aren't
able
to
use
these
immunity
statutes,
well,
our
activities
would
be
seriously
curtailed.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
i
think
with
statutory
up
to
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
of
course
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i'm
not
sure
what
year
it
was.
of
course
it's
embodied
in
our
constitution
now.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
--
i
think
it's
very
unlikely.
of
course,
i'm
not
really
--
i
didn't
start
in
this
thing
with
you
to
making
an
argument
on
that
point.
i
was
--
i
was
simply
trying
to
show
--
place
this
grand
jury
investigation
in
its
--
in
its
setting.
but
i
say
that
it
is
extremely
unlikely
and
it's
one
of
those
situations
where
route
remoteness
is
the
order
of
the
day.
and
again
i
say,
if
there
is
any
--
if
the
practice
to
that
effect,
i
think
that
it
should,
that
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioner
to
show
it.
but
coming
to
the
petitioner's
argument
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
touch
that
for
a
moment
because
i
think
it's
one
of
the
most
unusual
arguments
that
has
ever
been
made.
to
show
how
really
unusual
it
is,
one
has
to
examine
the
theme
--
the
legal
theme
of
the
decisions,
the
many
decisions
which
have
been
handed
down
by
this
court
on
this
general
subject.
now,
this
is
of
course
but
one
of
many
cases
which
have
come
before
the
court
where
state
legislation
or
state
action
has
been
attacked
upon
the
ground
that
someone's
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
infringed
upon.
and
for
that
reason,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
sometimes
these
claims
are
addressed
to
immunity
statutes
such
as
the
one
we're
dealing
with
here
where
it's
claimed
that
the
immunity
is
insufficient
--
insufficiently
broad
to
compensate
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
privilege.
sometimes
the
claims
are
addressed
to
other
kinds
of
statutes
such
as
those
which
permit
comment
upon
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand
at
a
trial.
but
generally
speaking,
whenever
this
type
of
contention
addressed
to
self-incrimination
privilege
arises,
there's
some
discussion
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
that's
the
one
that
embodies
the
privilege.
but
inevitably,
the
argument
is
relegated
to
due
process
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
that
is,
of
course,
because
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
applicable
to
the
states.
in
case
after
case
of
this
sort,
the
argument
and
the
issues
have
all
boiled
down
and
narrowed
down
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
and
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
with
that
in
mind,
i
find
that
most
surprising
that
there
was
not
one
word
mentioned
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
my
friend's
argument
here
last
thursday.
and
in
this
setting,
to
able
to
argue
with
the
contention
of
this
type
without
a
single
solitary
reference
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
really
an
incredible
feat.
now
from
this,
you
might
gather
that
the
argument
was
going
to
be
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
applicable
to
the
states.
and
that
mr.
fitzpatrick
was
going
to
try
to
overturn
the
well
settled
rule
from
the
time
of
barron
against
baltimore
that
it
is
not,
but
apparently
that's
not
his
argument
either.
in
fact,
when
he
was
asked
here
on
thursday
whether
that
was
his
position,
he
said
that
it
was
not.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
that
--
that's
--
that's
true.
but
i
--
i've
been
trying
to
pinpoint
this
argument
and
i
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty.
if
it
isn't
that,
what
is
it?
and
as
--
i
don't
want
to
be
presumptuous
but
i
think
the
court
may
be
somewhat
in
quandary
about
it
also.
as
nearly
as
i
can
spell
it
out,
it
runs
something
like
this.
that
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
privilege
principle
contained
in
it
is
a
right,
a
federal
right
against
a
right
to
avoid
federal
prosecution
primarily
he
says,
by
remaining
silent
wherever
one
happens
to
be.
it's
a
right
that
one
more
or
less
carries
about
inside
of
them.
perhaps
it
flows
through
the
bloodstream.
it's
like
a
coat
of
armor
protecting
wherever
he
is
or
a
badge
that
he
flashes
on
i
think
in
every
occasion
when
interrogation
holds
some
possibility
of
federal
consequences.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he's
in
a
federal
forum
or
in
a
state
forum,
whether
he
is
within
the
federal
jurisdiction
or
without
the
federal
jurisdiction.
this
right
to
avoid
the
federal
consequences
always
remains
with
him.
and
so,
he
carried
it
into
the
new
york
county
grand
jury
room
when
he
was
summoned
there.
and
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
federal
--
federal
forum,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whatsoever
because
he
had
his
fifth
amendment
federal
right
with
him.
now,
i
don't
have
to
labor
that,
i
think.
to
me
at
least,
it's
obviously
defective
because
the
federal
--
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
create
any
such
right
that
one
carries
with
one
around
inside
of
him,
so
to
speak.
whether
this
is
a
mandate,
an
injunction
against
the
federal
government
from
compelling
a
person
to
incriminate
himself
in
a
federal
forum,
whether
it'd
be
in
a
federal
court,
a
federal
grand
jury,
or
before
a
congressional
committee
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
and
this
petition
no
more
carried
a
federal
right,
this
federal
right
which
is
so
limited
and
narrow
into
our
grand
jury
room
then
he
would
have
carried
a
federal
right
into
the
court
of
special
sessions
of
new
york
city.
that's
a
--
a
court
of
misdemeanor
jurisdiction,
a
federal
right
to
have
a
jury
trial
there.and
of
course
he
didn't.
that's
purely
an
injunction
against
the
federal
officials
also.
i
don't
condemn
a
theory
because
it's
noble.
i
don't
think
i'm
going
to
slide
the
precedent,
but
i
am
surprised
when
my
friend
on
a
basis
of
something
so
tenuous
and
so
unsubstantial
as
this,
says
that
he
is
here
to
write
off
or
to
try
to
straighten
out
50
years
of
loose
thinking
by
this
court,
and
those
were
the
terms
that
he
used.
50
years
of
loose
thinking
along
the
familiar
accepted
stated
lines
which
i
mentioned
leading
up
to
due
process.
now
that
apparently
means
loose
thinking
in
jack
against
kansas,
twining
against
new
jersey,
palko
--
adamson
against
california,
not
to
mention
united
states
against
murdock
and
feldman
against
the
united
states.
loose
thinking
by
judges
like
peckham
and
mr.
justice
moody,
whose
opinion
in
twining
against
new
jersey,
i
know
mr.
justice
frankfurter
characterized
as
one
of
the
points
ever
written,
loose
thinking
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
himself
by
cardozo,
by
reed,
by
a
number
of
others.
i
can't
--
i
can't
accept
that
as
loose
thinking.
it
seems
to
me
logical
and
well-reasoned
that
we
should
be
relegated
to
a
question
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
oh,
i
don't
--
i
don't
say
that
the
court
may
not
overturn
basic
principles,
but
i
don't
think
that
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
argument
which
is
not
the
one
i
believe
that
would
result
in
the
change
of
mind
on
the
part
of
court.
i
don't
think
on
the
basis
of
that,
this
can
be
turned
loose
thinking.
i
--
i
fully
realize
that
mr.
--
that
for
example,
the
proposition
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
incorporate
the
bill
of
rights,
that
while
the
court
has
been
unanimous
in
its
decisions
on
the
subject,
it
was
not
unanimous
insofar
as
the
present
membership
is
concerned.
and
i
am
well
aware
of
the
very
learned
and
exhausted
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
adamson
against
california
in
which
he
reaches
the
contrary
result.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
a
contrary
conclusion.
but
for
the
purpose
of
--
i
think
it
would
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
argue
that
question.
the
court
knows
the
issue
there
and
i
must
proceed
here
on
the
assumption
that
that
is
the
law.
and
that
the
first
eight
amendments
are
not
incorporated
within
the
fourteenth.
since
the
fifth
amendment,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
this,
since
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
applicable
with
the
states,
of
course
we
must
proceed
to
the
fourteenth.
and
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
due
process,
i
don't
want
to
bore
the
court
with
obvious
propositions
that
what
has
to
be
established
in
order
to
spell
out
a
violation
of
due
process.
it's
something
that's
so
heinous
that
it
shocks
the
american
conscience
and
shocks
all
our
concepts
of
fairness
in
the
american
way
of
life.
no
point
in
my
spending
time
on
that
proposition
nor
do
i
have
to
recall
you
to
the
cases
which
say
that
although
a
principle
of
the
first
eight
amendments
maybe
accepted
and
admired
by
the
states.
it's
not
necessarily
one
of
the
basic
fundamental
rights
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
of
course,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
for
example,
has
been
held
to
be
one
that
is
not
of
that
basic
fundamental
nature,
the
right
to
trial
by
indictment,
protection
from
double
jeopardy
and
so
forth,
all
admirable
principles
no
doubt,
but
held
not
to
be
within
the
order
of
due
process.
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
again,
i
will
have
to
do
on
that
subject
i
think
is
to
mention
twining
against
new
jersey,
palko
against
connecticut,
and
adamson
against
california.
the
interesting
thing
about
the
twining
case,
the
leading
case
in
this
subject
to
me
is
that
it
flatly
holds
that
the
state
can
abolish
the
entire
privilege
against
self-incrimination
without
running
a
file
of
due
process.
and
what
that
means
here
is
that
if
our
new
york
provision
can
compel
this
witness
as
it
did
to
appear
and
testify,
even
if
it
gave
no
protection
or
immunity
whatsoever,
not
even
in
our
ownstate
courts,
it
still
wouldn't
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
that's
going
quite
far
of
course
and
we
certainly
don't
have
to
go
that
far
here.
there's
nothing
in
this
case
comparable
to
that.
new
york
approves
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out.
it's
in
our
constitution.
and
our
highest
courts
have
followed
of
course,
counselman
against
hitchcock,
and
said
that
the
immunity
granted
has
to
be
as
broad
as
the
privilege
destroyed
in
order
to
validate
these
provisions.
and
in
pursuant
to
that,
new
york
has
given
all
of
the
immunity
that
it
possibly
can.
so
we're
not
dealing
here
with
an
abolition
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
a
total
emasculation
of
it,
it's
from
the
failure
to
give
any
protection
or
immunity
whatsoever.
and
when
you
look
at
this
case
realistically,
you
see
that
the
danger
here,
and
of
course
i
suppose
i'm
repeating
myself
somewhat
here,
is
it
lies
in
a
number
of
very
highly
speculative
contingencies.
that
the
--
that
this
witness
might
give
testimony
before
our
grand
jury
indicating
that
he
was
guilty
of
bribe
receiving
under
the
taft-hartley
law,
that
the
federal
prosecutor
might
be
interested
in
this.
that
he
might
try
to
get
our
grand
jury
testimony
if
he
could.
and
of
course
that's
doubtful
in
any
event.
but
if
he
could
get
it,
he
would
use
it
and
so
forth
and
so
on
and
you
can
file
contingency
upon
contingency
here.
now,
i'm
not
arguing
exactly
a
substantial
danger
here
or
lack
of
it,
but
i
say
that
this
situation
comes
so
far
away
from
the
due
process
that
there
seems
to
be
--
that
it's
so
far
removed
from
due
process,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
labor
it
any
more
than
stating
the
fact,
the
factual
possibilities.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
by
defendant,
you
mean
--
you
mean
anyone
who
gave
down
a
testimony
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
--
you
don't
mean
just
the
defendants?
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes,
i
--
i
think
it
would.
i
think
then
you
would
have
to
view
the
situation
as
a
conspiratorial
type
contained
or
mentioned
in
feldman
against
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
no.
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
nevertheless,
that
this
court
would
be
sure
to
bring
that
within
the
feldman
rule
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
well,
then
i
would
say
that
you
have
a
really
--
then
i
would
say
you
could
predicate
real
and
substantial
danger
of
prosecution,
but
i
would
not
say
that
that's
a
--
there's
a
violation
of
due
process
or
at
least
i
would
not
concede
that
that's
a
violation
of
due
process.
perhaps
if
this
was
a
federal
case
and
the
situation
was
reversed,
i'd
say
that
undoubtedly,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
but
i
would
not
concede
that
in
our
situation,
that
would
amount
to
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
especially
since
the
law
as
it
stands
is
that
you
can
abolish
the
entire
privilege
against
self-incrimination
without
doing
violence
to
due
process.
now
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
that's
--
that's
you
said
it
better
than
i
could,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
what
i
had
in
mind.
is
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
denzer
yes.
i
have
--
i
have
mentioned
the
great
comments
that
i
think
a
contrary
holding,
an
adverse
holding
would
work
in
this
case.
i've
stated
how
valuable
these
immunity
provisions
are
to
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
question
at
the
outset
of
my
friend's
argument
which
i
thought
was
a
very
pertinent
one
and
i
don't
think
it
was
answered
squarely
at
least.
the
question
was
whether
if
immunity
provisions
or
it
could
be
--
or
rather,
if
in
any
field,
any
area
where
a
federal
crime
exists
covering
the
subject
matter
of
the
state
inquiry,
if
the
privilege
was
to
be
upheld
under
those
circumstances,
would
that
not
emasculate,
render
impotence
such
a
statute
in
every
situation
where
there
was
a
federal
crime?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
in
other
words,
any
time,
according
to
the
argument,
the
opposing
argument
here,
any
time
you
have
a
federal
crime,
federal
statute
covering
this
subject
matter
of
the
state
investigation,
the
immunity
statute
might
just
as
well
be
written
off
the
books
for
that
purpose.
and
of
course,
those
are
the
very
important
areas.
and
it
would
be
a
most
destructive
holding
and
one
that
i
think
that
would
erect
a
great
deal
of
havoc
throughout
the
country.
now,
i'm
not
claiming
that
the
expediency
should
be
an
excuse
for
abrogating
civil
rights
or
for
injustice
of
any
sort.
but
what
i
do
claim
here
is
or
i
do
submit
that
the
approach
to
these
very
valuable
immunity
provisions
should
not
be
one
of
trying
to
searching
for
technical
constitutional
defects,
that
it
should
be
one
of
attempting
to
reconcile
them
with
the
federal
constitution.
i
say
that
in
this
case,
that
reconciliation
is
certainly
very
simple.
i
say
that
it
is
one
that
is
based
upon
reason
and
logic
and
one
that
is
supported
by
the
authorities
as
they
are
seeing
today
down
through
the
years.
and
i
submit
that
to
overturn
that
now
would
both
be
illogical
and
unsolitary
from
a
social
point
of
view.
