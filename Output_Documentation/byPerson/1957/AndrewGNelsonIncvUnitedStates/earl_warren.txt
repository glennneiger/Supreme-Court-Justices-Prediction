mean
--
chief
justice
earl

what
i
mean
is
this.
this
is
new
unused
store
fixtures.
now
would
those
store

house
and
have
to
sell
household
fixtures
to
a
store,
they've
been
in
violation
of

may
i
ask
you
in
that
case,
was

was
the
question
there
whether
a
man
had

that
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
he
could
transport
before

chief

issuance
of
a
certificate?
chief

in
another
department,
supposed
they
sold
this
dried
milk
in
the
department

in
the
hardware
department
and
the
cabinets
and
so
forth
in
another
--
another
part
--

but
if
he
delivered
it
to
--
to
a
drugstore
with
the
actual
--
where
they
didn't
departmentalize
their
store.
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
--
if
the
store
departmentalizes,
it
wouldn't
be
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'd
also
say
that
if
it
went
to
a
particular
store
and
the
drug
department
is
on
one
side
at
the
aisle
and
the
cigar
store
on

other
side
and

the
editions
of

cigar
store
and
the
