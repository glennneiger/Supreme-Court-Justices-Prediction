mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr
blanchard
stated,
this
is
an
enforcement
proceeding
brought
by
interstate
commerce
commission
resulting
in
a
cease
and
desist
order.
the
appellant
corporation
holds
an
icc
contract
carrier
permit
by
truck.
this
is
not
a
common
carrier
but
a
contract
carrier.
those
carriers
were
allowed
to
discriminate
between
customers
as
to
price
infusing
the
haul
and
are
closely
confined
as
what
--
with
whom
they
can
deal
and
what
they
can
haul.
the
permit
recently
issued
in
1942
authorizes
the
appellant
corporation
to
carry
three
categories
which
are
listed,
store
fixtures,
household
good,
and
stock
in
trade
of
drug
store.
this
permit
was
issued
then
to
nelson
in
1942.
in
1951,
they
requested
icc
to
transfer
--
they
approved
a
transfer
to
a
corporation
bearing
into
nelson's
name.
in
1953,
the
present
owners
of
the
corporation
bought
the
stock
of
the
corporation,
acquired
the
corporation
and
the
permit
which
apparently
was
the
only
asset
they
acquired
from
the
record.
it
took
no
trucks
or
other
equipment.
starting
in
1953,
they
proceed
to
engage
in
large
great
variety
of
hauling.
they
recently
engaged
in
hauling
100-pound
sacks
of
dried
glue
to
a
manufacturer
of
gummed
products.
drums
of
lard
weighing
over
400
pounds
each,
cases
of
beer
and
wine,
automobile
battery,
and
100-pound
bags
of
dried
milk,
a
large
number
of
other
commodities,
all
in
truck
load
lots.
there
is
no
suggestion
by
the
permit
holder
corporation
that
this
could
be
considered
store
fixtures
or
household
goods.
none
of
this
--
the
theory
is,
they
are
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores.
none
of
these
goods
ever
had
any
connection
with
the
drugstore.
they
were
not
shipped
to
a
drugstore,
by
a
drugstore
at
no
time
would
ever
intended
to
become
stock
in
trade
of
any
drugstore
at
any
kind.
appellant
argues
that
nonetheless
it
may
carry
such
items
under
its
permit.
has
the
permit
properly
construed
authorizes
the
hauling
of
all
these
items
as
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores.
the
theory
is
that
since
some
drugstores
sell
milk,
they
can
carry
milk,
that
100-pound
sack
of
dried
milk
is
still
a
stock
in
trade
of
a
drugstore.
in
some
drugstores
or
since
many
drugstores
sell
glue,
they
can
haul
100-pound
sacks
of
dried
glue
to
the
gummed
products
manufacturing
company.
the
commission
after
a
hearing
decided
that
was
not
what
the
permit
meant.
the
commission
has
said
that
appellant
may
transport
commodities
which
are
part
of
the
stock
in
trade
of
any
drugstore
and
commodities
which
the
time
of
their
movement
are
intended
to
become
part
of
the
stock
in
trade
of
any
drugstore.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
or
if
the
good
themselves
were
to
become
the
stock
in
trade
of
what
a
drugstore
sold.
they
could
be
--
carry
any
commodity,
no
matter
how
usual
it
is
for
a
drugstore
to
carry,
if
in
fact
it's
part
of
a
stock
in
trade
of
--
of
a
particular
drugstore,
that's
what
the
permit
intended.
appellant
here
has
two
major
contentions,
i
believe.
the
first
is
that
the
permit,
as
issued
in
1942,
authorized
the
hauling
of
the
commodities
he
is
now
hauling
and
he
then
argues
that
the
commission
has
attempted
to
take
away
rights
he
once
had.
the
second
contention
is
that
whatever
the
permit
says,
the
corporation
today
has
the
right
to
haul
whatever
its
predecessor's
interest
was
hauling
in
1935.
he
then
alleges
that
it
was
error
for
the
commission
to
refuse
to
consider
evidence
of
what
was
actually
hauled
in
1935.
i
believe
those
are
the
two
principal
contentions,
first,
the
construction
of
the
permit
and
second,
whether
notwithstanding
the
permit
the
commission
should've
considered
what
he
was
actually
hauling
and
allowed
him
to
continue
to
haul
it.
now,
the
question
is
what
did
the
permit
--
first
question
is,
what
did
the
permit
mean
in
1942
when
it
was
first
issued
--
issued?
we
do
not
claim
the
right
to
cut
down
grandfather
permits.
we
do
not
claim
that
we
can
violate
a
rule
of
construction
and
bring
about
the
kind
of
change
we
could
not
bring
about
by
an
amendment
of
a
permit.
now
first,
the
commission
construed
this
permit
on
its
face
and
they
found
that
it
was
not
ambiguous.
the
commission's
construction
appears
in
the
record
at
24,
is
basically
what
i
said,
commodities
that
are
intended
to
go
to
a
drug
--
as
far
as
the
stock
in
trade
of
drug
store,
commodities
that
are
part
of
stock
in
trade
of
a
drugstore
or
intended
to
become
so.
we
think
that's
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language,
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores
is
--
if
you're
limited
to
hauling
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores,
you're
never
to
hauling
goods
that
are
in
fact
stock
in
trade
of
a
drugstore.
there
is
no
--
we
do
not
accept
the
view
they're
--
they
technical
or
special
meaning
to
this
phrase
that
the
mcateer
case
which
mr.
blanchard
had
said
held
the
two
were
the
same,
his
argument
stems
from
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
a
long
opinion,
both
phrases
were
used,
could
such
as
sold
grocery
stores
and
stock
in
trade
of
grocery
stores.
they
were
not
used
as
parallels.
in
the
opinion,
there's
certain
no
holding
that
they
were
the
same.
appellant
corporation's
argument
here
basically
is,
believe
it's
clear,
that
this
construction
is
clearly
erroneous
because
the
method
of
limitation
was
unknown
in
1942.
his
argument
is
that
the
commission
construction
of
the
permit
is
not
entitled
to
the
respect
that
commission's
construction
of
their
own
permit
usually
would
have
that
it
must
be
upheld
unless
clearly
erroneous
because
in
1942
whenever
the
commission
mentioned
a
commodity
it
meant
you
could
carry
good
such
as
that
commodity
that
the
--
what
he
calls
the
intended
use
restriction
of
what's
--
which
in
the
jargon
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
become
more
and
more
used
at
the
intended
use
restriction
was
unknown.
this
is
a
later
device
dreamed
up
later.
he
says
that
prior
to
1949
which
is
when
he
gives
the
intended
use
test
beginning,
if
a
trucker
was
authorized
to
haul
commodities
such
as
lard,
he
could
haul
for
anybody
at
anywhere
without
regard
to
its
intended
use.
and
since
andrew
nelson
was
authorized
to
haul
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores,
his
argument
goes,
this
must
necessarily
be
construed
to
mean
he
can
haul
any
commodity
similar
to
that
which
might
be
or
customarily
would
be
carried
in
a
drugstore.
the
--
the
error
in
his
argument
is
--
i
think
in
the
argument
advanced
here
i
think
is
clearly
demonstrated
by
reference
to
the
very
permit
here
in
question
and
to
the
cases
cited
by
appellant.
appellant's
brief,
page
24,
refers
to
the
classification
of
motor
carriers
or
property
in
two
motor
carrier
cases,
703,
either
shows
that
no
--
intents
to
show
that
the
only
way
of
describing
commodity
was
by
generic
or
class
terms
about
a
type
of
equipment
to
be
operated
and
naming
them
specifically.
the
permit
here
for
the
item
immediately
preceding
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores
is
household
goods,
a
much
more
common
form
of
permit.
there
are
many
more
household
good
carriers
that
are
much
more
common.
this
was
one
of
the
types
of
commodities
listed
in
the
classification
of
motor
carrier
property
in
1937,
five
years
before
this
permit
was
issued.
carriers
of
household
goods,
i'm
now
reading
from
page
709
of
two
motor
carrier
cases,
household
good
carriers
include
carriers
both
common
and
contract,
engaged
the
transportation
of
property
commonly
used
in
a
household
when
a
part
of
such
household
equipment
or
supply.
they
could
carry
a
commodity,
not
any
commodity
to
anybody,
they
carry
this
commodity
when
a
part
of
such
household
equipment
or
supply,
and
they
also
carry
furniture,
fixtures,
equipment,
and
the
property
usual
in
an
office,
museum,
institution,
hospital
or
similar
establishment
when
a
part
of
the
stock,
equipment
or
supplies
such
office,
museum
or
the
similar
establishment.
the
household
goods
carriers,
their
method
of
classification
developed
in
1937.
when
you
say
household
goods,
you
didn't
mean
good
such
as
are
in
a
household,
you
meant
goods
when
they
were
part
of
the
household.
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores,
the
very
phrase
here,
the
household
good
carrier
under
this
general
authority
was
allowed
to
carry
property
usual
in
an
office,
museum,
institution,
hospital
or
other
similar
establishment
when
a
part
of
the
stock,
equipment
or
supply.
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.but
they
would
be
--
when
a
part
of
a
--
they
would
be
this
description
i
just
read
to
you,
household
goods
would
be
goods
when
a
part
of
household
equipment
and/or
other
similar
establishment
or
stock
and
so
forth,
it
would
have
to
be
a
part.
the
case
--
issue
was
raised
two
years
later
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
as
to
whether
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
excuse
me.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
store
fixtures
certainly
could
be
moving
toward
a
--
a
wholesale
house
but
the
fixture
itself
must
be
intended
for
use
in
a
store,
a
store
fixture.

for
laboratory
purposes,
they
could
not

it
saying,

goods
are
used
in
a

it
would
have
to
be
a
store
fixture.
household
goods
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
the
--
the
goods
must
be
going
--
that
issue
was
raised
here
in
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores.
if
a
man
is
dealing
with
drug
supplies
going
to
a
drug
warehouse
where
most
of
the
goods
are
sold
to
drugstores,
if
these
particular
items
happen
to
go
to
a
grocery
store
which
can't
carry
drugs,
we
would
not
say
that
was
not
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores.
it
is
--
in
time
of
its
movement,
it
is
intended
to
be
in
the
category
of
goods
moving
toward
a
drugstore
or
sale.
i
think
that
the
household
goods
is
a
--
is
a
good
analogy
because
household
goods
is
a
common
form
of
permit.
it
was
going
to
in
detail.
the
question
was
raised
whether
new
furniture
which
had
not
become
a
part
of
the
household
yet,
i'm
moving
from
washington
and
chicago.
i've
got
some
things.
i
buy
some
things
that
i
will
set
a
new
house,
as
they
ship
all
--
all
my
new
things
taken
together.
the
furniture
i
now
buy
has
never
been
to
my
house,
it's
not
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
--
my
household
goods.
the
case
--
the
--
the
method
was
--
the
question
was
considered
by
the
--
in
1939
by
the
commerce
commission
in
17
motor
carriers'
cases.
this
is
not
cited
in
my
brief,
i
regret
to
say,
17
motor
carriers'
cases,
473.
commission
concluded
in
short,
articles
which
have
become
incorporated
into
those
used
in
the
household
either
by
a
physical
incorporation
or
by
acquisition
by
the
household
or
with
the
intent
of
such
incorporation
should
be
deemed
to
be
household
goods.
this
again
is
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
permit
showing
that
the
intended
use
limitation
that
was
well
established,
the
concept
of
goods
you
can
haul
them
by
their
status
was
clearly
recognized.
this
is
looking
at
the
permit
on
its
face.
if
you
look
at
the
permit
in
the
light
of
the
record
which
is
before
this
court
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
was
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
this
was
a
general
proceeding
called
practices
of
motor
common
carriers
of
household
goods.
if
--
as
upon
investigation
they
clarified
and
modified
the
rules
which
are
contained
in
two
motor
carriers'
cases
which
i
first
read
you
is
the
general
proceeding
dealing
with
the
matter.
now,
the
application
which
mr.
nelson
submitted
and
the
accompanying
attachments
are
in
the
record,
the
applications
of
247
and
the
attachments
are
257
and
259
and
thereafter
in
the
record.
the
applications
i
might
say
on
page
249
indicated
that
his
operations
which
he
was
to
completely
describe
his
operations
on
july
1,
1935.
operations
involved
transportation
over
various
routes,
etcetera,
of
store
fixtures
and
miscellaneous
merchandise
and
household
goods
of
employees
for
walgreen
company
in
connection
with
the
opening,
closing
and,
remodeling
of
stores.
this
was
his
entire
operation
as
an
application
described
it.
attached
to
his
permit
were
copies
of
his
state
permits
he
had
obtained
from
some
of
neighboring
states
to
illinois.
the
--
one
of
these
is
the
indiana
commission
at
which
the
operative
language
is
on
257.
it's
furthered
ordered
by
the
public
service
commission
that
operations
under
this
permit
be
restricted
to
hauling
for
the
--
for
walgreen
and
company
under
the
contract
submitted
to
the
commission.
this
is
an
attachment
to
his
application
is
what
he
wanted.
he
wanted
to
indicate
that
he
had
some
business.his
business
under
already
permits
was
limited
to
hauling
for
walgreen
and
company.
the
same
is
true
in
wisconsin,
259,
he's
authorized
transport
store
fixtures
for
walgreen
drugstores,
was
later
amended
on
260
of
the
record
to
include
transportation
of
household
goods
and
employees
of
walgreen
drugstores
and
a
merchandise
stores,
said
walgreen
drugstores
between
various
municipalities
and
so
forth.
1936,
in
the
grandfather
proceeding
he
--
he
signed
a
statement
which
appears
in
263
and
264.
it's
indicated
that
the
entire
cargo
insurance
on
the
three
units
engaged
instate
commerce
was
carried
by
the
walgreen
company.
on
264,
he
stated,
“that
he,
as
an
interstate
contract
carrier
of
property
for
the
walgreen
company
and
for
it
alone.”
next
number
8,
264,
“that
he
hauls
to
and
from
walgreen
retail
stores,
etcetera.
the
said
transportation
has
to
do
with
the
opening,
the
remodeling,
and/or
the
closing
of
walgreen
retail
stores.
the
commodities
are
so
transported,
the
commodities
so
transported
are
usually
store
fixtures
and
equipment
and
merchandise
for
the
opening
stock."
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
recommendation
of
the
examiner
was
that
it
be
so
limited
but
in
the
view
of
the
language
of
the
act
that
he
should
pretty
get
other
contracts
within
the
scope
of
his
permit.
it
was
categorized
as
drugstores
and
there
was
no
contention
here
that
such
a
classification
would
be
unreasonable
or
arbitrary
that
hauling
stock
for
drugstores
is
not
a
broad
enough
classification.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
but
i
say
if
you're
looking
--
what
the
trade
of
stock
and
trade
of
drugstores
means
in
the
light
of
the
statements,
he
may.
it
is
fairly
clear
that
he
was
only
hauling
things
that
not
good
like
--
not
goods
such
as
those
hauling
drugstores.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i'm
sure
that
if
he
limits
himself
to
goods
which
so
far
as
he
know
were
going
to
be
sold
to
the
drugstores,
this
proceeding
would
never
would've
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
permitted.
there
is
no
limitation
unlike
the
keystone
restriction.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
is
no
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
what
do
you
mean,
you
can
--
with
100
pound
bags
of
dried
glue,
they're
pretty
darn
clear
that
the
wholesaler
is
not
going
to
send
this
around.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
hair
tonic,
i
would
think
if
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
goods
were
destined
for
sale
or
to
become
the
stock
of
a
drugstore
or
even
i
would
think
that
a
drug
--
i
would
think
that
a
drug
department
of
a
grocery
store
might
well
fall
within
the
--
the
category
it
was
(inaudible).
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
if
there
was
a
substantial
unit
dealing
in
a
--
in
a
department
store.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
have
to
understand
the
goods
are
going
to
be
--
or
to
become
a
stock
in
trade.
he
was
only
hauling
his
grandfather
operations
which
he
told
the
commission
were
limited
to
hauling
goods
which
were
the
opening
stock
of
drugstores.
now,
the
grandfather
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
permit
says
he
can
haul
for
any
drugstore
not
just
walgreen.
the
permit
is
limited
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
it
says
stock
in
trade
of.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
what's
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
say
he
was
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
under
his
limited
permit
as
a
contract
carrier
allowed
to
discriminate
among
different
shippers
to
charge
different
prices
within
the
scope
of
his
authority,
he
should
find
out
whether
these
goods
are
intended
to
become
stock
in
trade
of
a
drugstore.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there
are
--
there
are
hundreds
of
permits
as
mr.
blanchard
had
suggested,
a
contractor
supplies
whole
set
of
items
limited
to
this
--
a
well
settled
method
in
which
supplies
must
be
dealt
for
a
contractor,
they
must
be
ending
up,
they
must
be
coming
to
a
contract
and
(voice

--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
(voice

hammers
or
thongs,
you
might
not
know
but
generally
speaking
in
the
word,
you
know
whether
the
goods
are
going
where
the
wholesale
or
with
whom
the
wholesale
would
sell.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
i
would
say
it
was
not
a
drugstore.
that
was
not
stock
in
trade
of
a
drugstore.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
i
would
like
to
let
the
commerce
commission
first
take
a
look
at
a
particular
case
as
to
whether
it
was
a
drugstore
or
not
in
defining
what
is
a
drugstore.
it's
conceded
here
and
stipulated
that
these
stores
are
not
--
none
of
the
stores
here
would
be
called
a
drugstore.
that
was
--
that's
an
agreement.
we
don't
have
the
test
that
whether
a
merchandise
store
with
the
broadening
definition
of
drugstore.
we
don't
have
that.
the
--
the
question
which
the
order
is
here,
he
said
that
when
the
commerce
commission
to
decide
that
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores
means
goods
which
will
become
the
stock
in
trade
of
drug
store.
that's
stock
in
trade
of
drug
stores
means,
they're
authorized
to
haul
stocks
in
trade
of
a
drugstore.
he
says
that
it's
clearly
erroneous
and
cannot
be
sustained.
i
think,
it's
an
error
of
law
for
the
commission
to
say
that
since
there
was
a
well-settled
rule
at
that
time
that
goods
were
not
defined
in
that
way.
he
is
wrong
as
to
his
proposition
of
the
well-settled
rule
of
goods
were
defined
in
that
way.
i
believe
that
the
commerce
commission
is
entitled
to
construe
their
permit
and
that
there
is
no
violation
of
standards
not
arbitrary
or
capricious.
i
think
if
anyone
said
i'm
--
i
have
some
stock
in
trade
of
a
drug
store,
i
can
haul
stock
in
trade
of
drug
store,
you
would
have
--
and
certainly
is
reasonable
to
say,
it
must
be
stock
in
trade
of
a
drugstore.
it's
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it's
not
so
unreasonable
and
so
irrational.
the
commission
cannot
construe
this
permit.
in
the
light
of
the
printed
records
submitted
to
the
commission
saying
that
all
he
was
hauling,
all
he
was
hauling
was
stock
in
trade
of
drug
store.
now,
my
set
of
question
never
came
up.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
record
that
there
was
ever
any
hauling
until
the
corporation
changed
hands.
it
was
bought
in
1953
by
the
present
owners
who
then
hoping
to
construe
this
permit
as
they
are
now
going
to
do
engaged
in
operations
which
the
original
owner
had
never
engaged
in
at
all.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
--
would
he
be
free
to
do
if
he
violated
the
--
the
permit?
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
think
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
think
that
reader's
digest
is
being
distributed
in
large
number
of
places
other
than
drugstores.
i
assume
that
was
not
contemplated
with
a
drugstore.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
all
sorts
of
things
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
do
and
that
--
that
in
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
is
the
thrust
of
his
case.
he
is
taking
a
permit
issued
to
andrew
g.
nelson
in
1942.
it's
authorized
him
to
transport
which
were
he
was
then
hauling
for
a
drugstore,
trying
to
construe
this
permit
in
light
of
the
changing
role
of
drugstore
to
say
we
can
haul
anything
for
anybody
because
look
at
the
drugstore
haul.
we
can
haul
100
pound
bags
of
dry
glue,
we
can
haul
400
pound
drums
of
lard
to
industrial
concerns.
why?
because
glue
is
sold
in
a
drugstore.
because
lard
is
sold
in
a
drugstore.
now,
i'd
like
just
to
turn
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
you
misunderstood
--
you
misunderstand
me
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
your
honor.
he
can
transport
stock,
goods
that
are
handled
in
a
drugstore.
he
can
--
he
can
just
transport
goods
that
are
going
to
end
up,
as
being
handled
in
a
drugstore.
now
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
store
is
a
drugstore,
whether
you
could
take
the
drug
department
of
a
large
department
store
which
has
a
whole
floor
and
say,
i
was
hauling
this
for
the
drugstore
aspect
of
that
and
therefore
even
though
according
to
law
if
it's
not
a
drugstore,
it's
within
my
permit.
i
would
like
the
commerce
commission
to
see
whether
that
can
fall
in
a
drugstore,
where
they
can
divide,
whether
it's
reasonable.
that
--
that
would
be
one
thing
for
them
to
decide.
but
to
say
when
he
is
hauling
to
a
manufacturer
of
gummed
products,
he's
hauling
100
pound
bags
of
dried
glue
and
to
say
if
that
must
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
law
with
all
deference
to
the
commerce
commission
be
upset
as
arbitrary
and
capricious,
i
think
it's
--
there's
no
merit
in
the
position
being
urged
here.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
do
not
know.
now,
there
are
two
--
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
two
questions.
first,
he
said
there
was
error
to
refuse
to
consider
evidence
as
to
pre-1935
hauling.
i
must
say
take
some
courage
to
come
here
having
objected,
extraneously
objected
below
to
considering
any
evidence.
i
refer
to
page
114,
115,
and
116
of
the
record.
the
commission
under
the
seatrain
case
and
i'm
reading
appellant's
counsel
statement
below
for
the
commission
hearing
officer,
commission
under
the
seatrain
case
is
without
authority
to
consider
them
to
existing
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
permit.
over
on
page
115,
my
objection
goes
to
consideration
of
any
fact
existing
prior
to
the
date
of
issuance
of
the
permit
this
carrier
in
1942.
over
on
116,
the
supreme
court
decision,
the
seatrain
case
and
others
stopped
the
court
--
commission
from
going
back
and
considering
anything
that
happened
back
at
the
permit.
again,
i
do
without
--
i
--
as
i
do
without
waiting
my
contention
that
nobody
has
the
right
to
go
back
to
the
permit.
the
commission
sustained
its
position.
the
iccs
officer
putting
on
the
case
took
the
opposing
position
at
that
time.
the
commission
sustained
a
position
which
appellant
urged
below.
he
now
said
that
was,
this
horrible
error
requires
sending
it
back.
they
gave
me
what
i
wanted.
the
--
first
place
on
the
merit,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
so
that
1935
he
was
doing
anything
except
hauling
for
walgreen
drugs.
the
testimony
of
andrew
g.
nelson
that
he
got
out,
a
lot
of
these
businesses
after
prohibition,
he
was
hauling
sugar
during
prohibition.
and
he
go
out
of
the
marble
business
on
the
record
137
and
then
record
155,
the
commissioner
asked
--
the
examining
office
asked
him,
if
he
could've
shown
during
the
one
year
preceding
1935,
he
could
have
shown
any
receipts
for
other
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
he
was
engaged
in
local
commerce
around
chicago,
local
hauling
in
warehouses.
and
interstate
commerce,
any
receipts
other
than
those
of
walgreen,
he
said,
he
did
not
know.
now,
finally
appellant
argues
that
regardless
of
the
permit
it
may
now
haul
whatever
andrew
nelson
he
did
in
1935.
his
position
is
that
the
permit
makes
no
difference.
that
he
can
--
he
can
haul
at
any
time,
accept
the
permit,
ignore
it,
haul
whatever
he
likes
and
then
defend
against
the
compliance
order
on
the
ground
the
permit
was
not
broad
enough.
there
are
several
objections
to
this
argument.first,
before
the
commission,
he
stated,
he
never
raised
this
point.
he
said
the
only
issue
is
record
204.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
what
certain
language
in
the
permit
means.
none
of
the
exceptions
the
examiner's
report
mentioned
this
operation.
secondly,
the
statutory
language
makes
it
clear
that
appellant
has
no
right
to
engage
in
transportation
outside
the
permit.
the
--
the
statue
printed
on
--
the
very
section
he
relies
on
209,
printed
page
33.
no
person
shall
engage
in
the
business
of
a
contract
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
unless
there
is
enforced
with
respect
to
such
carrier
a
permit
issued
by
the
commission
authorizing
such
person
to
engage
in
such
business.
now,
the
requirement,
commission
issue
a
permit
for
grandfather
cases
is,
the
commission
shall
issue
such
permit
without
further
proceeding
if
application
for
such
permit
is
made
to
the
commission.
as
provided
in
paragraph
b,
this
section,
been
120
days.
my
time
is
up.
but
may
i
just
make
one
sentence
in
reference
to
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
the
callanan
case
as
decided,
this
court
that
where
a
permit
has
changed
hands,
it
has
not
been
challenge
when
issued,
not
been
challenged
when
it
changed
hands,
and
this
permit
did,
that
the
person
who
gets
the
permit
is
stuck
with
the
permit
as
it
was
when
it
transferred.
it
cannot
go
back.
and
the
appellant's
remedy
if
he
has
one,
if
there
had
been
any
violation,
appellant
may
petition
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
reopen
the
grandfather
proceeding
and
consider
whether
a
mistake
was
made.
the
commission
has
been
willing
to
do
so
as
late
as
1954
where
good
grounds
were
shown.
without
--
i'm
not
saying
there
are
good
grounds
that
that
is
his
remedy.
thank
you.
