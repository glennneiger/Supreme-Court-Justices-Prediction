mr.
harry
w.
horton
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
counsel
for
the
appellees
held
and
i
hope
with
your
consent,
divided
their
arguments
into
three
parts.
i'll
take
approximately
30
minutes
on
the
--
of
the
two
counsel
approximately
the
same
time.
the
portion
of
the
case
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
your
permission
deals
with
the
historical
fact,
the
record
and
background
of
this
case,
so
that
with
that
in
mind,
we
may
first
discuss
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
my
argument
will
be
directed
very
largely
if
not
entirely
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
the
historical
background
of
the
central
valley
project
is
this.
that
in
1850,
when
california
became
a
state,
a
statute
was
passed
leading
to
an
investigation
of
the
impounding
of
waters
in
the
northern
areas
and
they've
taken
them
to
the
areas
where
there
was
less
water
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
san
joaquin
valley
and
also
portions
of
the
sacramento.
those
studies
continued
by
legislative
enactment
over
a
--
an
extended
period
of
years.
the
interest
in
that
as
a
state
endeavor
was
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
in
one
year,
when
the
legislature
forgot
to
make
an
appropriation,
the
chambers
of
commerce
of
the
city
of
san
francisco
and
also
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
raised
$100,000
to
provide
the
engineering
staff
of
funds
to
continue
the
work
as
a
state
project.
by
1913,
it
was
realized
that
the
system
of
water
rights
that
existed
in
california
which
at
that
--
up
to
that
time
has
been
one
of
merely
going
out
and
starting
a
diversion
works
in
building
a
canal
or
after
1872,
posting
a
notice
and
recording
a
notice
that
that
system
was
not
what
should
be.
and
in
1913,
they
passed
what
was
known
as
the
water
commission
act.
in
that
act,
the
existing
rights
were
validated
and
recognized
and
the
procedure
which
now
exist
in
california
was
set
up
under
the
water
commission
act
which
is
the
filing
of
an
application
with
the
state
engineer
now
the
division
of
water
resource
--
department
of
water
resources
and
the
proper
division
of
it
under
which
permits
are
issued
of
which
are
subject
to
certain
degrees
of
discretion
within
the
state
engineers
as
to
whether
for
that
water
shall
be
taken
and
the
quantities
that
maybe
used
and
whether
or
not
the
use
and
purpose
proposed
is
a
proper
one
under
the
state
law.
in
1921,
the
plan
had
proceeded
far
enough
that
in
that
year
the
legislature
provided
for
what
they
called
a
state
plan
and
further
the
studies
on
the
basis
of
the
state
plan
that
encompassed
a
greater
area
than
the
san
joaquin
and
the
--
and
the
sacramento
valleys.
by
1927,
the
state
realized
the
fact
that
the
water
law
of
california
was
primarily
that
of
appropriation.
and
therefore,
passed
a
statute
which
was
not
to
direct
free
but
mandatory
in
which
required
the
director
of
finance
of
the
state
of
california
to
file
on
all
of
the
inappropriated
waters
of
the
state
of
california
that
might
be
necessary
for
any
of
these
projects
under
this
proposed
state
plan
and
in
particular
with
reference
to
the
central
valley
project
which
was
even
at
that
time
taking
shape.
those
filings
were
made
by
the
director
of
finance
in
1927
and
we
are
interested
in
this
case
only
on
the
filings
on
the
san
joaquin
river
and
incidentally
on
the
filings
of
the
sacramento
river
because
the
water
for
these
districts
comes
from
the
friant
dam
and
the
canal
that
comes
to
the
madera
district
from
the
friant
dam
and
the
canal
that
comes
from
friant
dam
through
the
area
to
the
south
and
to
the
ivanhoe
district.
so,
what
we're
concerned
with
are
those
--
are
those
particular
filings.
filing
the
--
following
the
enactment
of
that
legislation
and
the
making
of
those
filings
in
due
form,
the
legislature
took
the
next
step
and
in
1933,
created
what
was
known
as
the
water
project
authority
of
california.
now,
that
agency
was
created
as
a
body
politic
of
the
state
of
california
with
power
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
what's
certain
definite
mandatory
duties
and
certain
discretionary
duties,
but
their
primary
function
was
to
build
and
construct
and
operate
and
maintain
the
central
valley
project.
at
the
same
time
of
the
creation
of
the
water
project
authority,
the
legislature
created
by
definition
the
central
valley
project.
following
the
organization
or
the
creation
of
the
water
project
authority,
that
organization
picked
up
the
work
that
had
previously
been
done
and
prepared
a
plan
in
detail,
an
engineering
plan
in
detail
of
where
this
water
was
to
be
taken
and
what
areas
were
to
be
served.
and
in
that
particular
plan,
both
by
description
and
by
reference
to
a
map
contained
in
the
document
itself,
the
ivanhoe
district
which
had
not
yet
been
formed
but
the
area
of
it
defined
and
designated
on
the
map
was
drawn
out
as
an
area
to
be
served
under
these
filings
that
had
been
made
by
the
director
of
finance.
the
madera
district
was
already
in
--
in
existence
but
it
was
also
encompassed
by
description
on
also
upon
these
maps
as
one
of
the
areas
to
be
served
from
the
friant
dam
and
from
the
madera
canal.
now,
following
the
next
step
--
the
next
one
was
the
effort
on
the
part
of
the
water
project
authority
to
proceed
to
construct
the
central
valley
project
of
california.
the
act
authorized
the
authority
to
issue
$170
million
in
bonds
which
at
that
time
was
the
estimated
cost
of
the
works
that
were
encompassed
within
the
central
valley
project.
the
bond
market
was
not
favorable
due
to
the
depression
and
the
water
project
authority
came
to
washington
and
filed
with
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
an
application
for
a
loan
on
grant
if
you
obtain
the
money
so
that
the
water
project
authority
might
proceed
with
the
construction
under
the
statutes
and
the
duty
that
was
imposed
upon
it
by
that
state
legislation.
the
application
was
received
and
favorably
acted
upon
until
somebody
suggested
that
it
might
be
a
lot
easier
to
get
the
money
under
the
works
progress
authority.
and
so,
the
first
appropriation
that
was
made,
not
as
a
loan
on
grant,
but
in
the
interest
of
employment
during
the
depression
was
the
advancement
of
$12
million
on
the
order
of
the
president
to
start
the
work
on
this
project.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
was
assigned
as
the
agency
to
do
the
actual
construction
work.
and
the
bureau
opened
an
office
in
sacramento,
california
to
start
work
on
the
project
itself
using
the
engineering
data,
the
designs,
the
plans
and
the
specifications
and
the
details
that
had
been
proffered
for
the
state
of
california.
as
they
came
in
to
california,
the
water
project
authority
entered
into
a
series
of
contracts
with
the
bureau
of
reclamation
for
certain
engineering
services
which
they
were
to
render
and
also
the
contracts
contained
a
provision
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
parties
that
a
contract
be
made
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
between
the
united
states
and
the
water
project
authority
whereby
the
water
project
authority
would
proceed
with
the
arrangements
necessary
for
the
distribution
of
the
water
and
the
collection
of
the
revenues
from
that
distribution
of
the
waters
and
the
repayment
to
the
united
states
government
of
the
amount
of
money
that
it
might
invest
in
the
project.
that
contract
ran
on
for
a
period
of
time
in
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
officials
of
the
state
of
california
including
the
then
governor
of
california.
they
tried
to
get
the
contract
that
was
provided
for.
and
i
think
it
was
governor
rolph,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
who
wrote
letters
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
getting
no
results
from
the
letters,
finally
sent
telegrams
which
finally
culminated
in
a
meeting,
two
meetings
in
fact
one,
in
san
francisco
and
one
in
sacramento,
in
which
the
governor
then
demanded
that
the
united
states
live
up
to
its
agreement
that
its
entry
into
the
central
valley
project
of
california
would
be
as
a
construction
agency
and
so
that
the
water
project
authority
of
california
created
by
its
legislator
and
imposed
with
the
duty
not
a
discretionary
duty
but
imposed
with
the
duty
to
construct,
operate
and
maintain
and
collect
the
revenue
from
this
project,
might
proceed
with
its
work.
the
result
of
that
conference
was
a
flat
refusal
by
a
representative
of
the
department
of
interior
to
even
consider
any
participation
on
the
part
of
the
water
project
authority
in
connection
with
making
any
contracts
or
having
anything
to
do
with
the
distribution
of
this
water
and
the
state
was
specifically
advised,
as
i
say
the
state,
the
water
project
authority
of
california
was
specifically
advised,
that
they
were
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that
phase
of
the
case.
the
matter
then
proceeded
for
a
few
years
with
a
impasse
of
that
character.
and
finally,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
proposed
certain
contracts
which
they
circulated
to
various
irrigation
districts
within
the
central
valley
project.
those
contracts
are
or
generally
in
a
formal
rather
modified
in
some
particulars,
but
generally
in
the
form
of
the
ivanhoe
contract
which
we
can
take
as
an
exemplar.
questioning
of
the
local
officials
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
give
us
very
little
light
on
one
of
the
things
that
we
were
particularly
interested
in
and
that
is
what
was
this
9
(e)
contract?
we
were
told
that
it
was
a
contract
by
which
water
would
be
delivered.
we
asked
questions
as
to
what
water
right
does
the
district
have?
what
water
right
does
the
landowner
have
under
that
contract?
we
could
not
get
a
definite
answer
until
we
finally
came
back
to
washington
and
then
the
conference
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
commissioner
of
reclamation,
we
were
finally
advised
of
the
fact
that
this
9
(e)
contract
was
a
new
type,
a
new
thought
in
reclamation.
it
was
a
contract
by
which
the
government
was
going
to
deliver
water
as
a
utility.
the
gentlemen
in
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
department
of
interior
gave
the
name
which
followed
through
on
these
contracts.
it
is
a
utility
type
contract.
under
the
law,
they
said
they
could
not
recognize
a
water
right
in
the
landowner
or
the
district
beyond
the
period
of
40
years
and
at
the
end
of
it,
there
could
be
no
agreement
implied
or
expressed
that
they
would
renew
the
contract.
the
next
question
we
raised
will
now
--
ordinarily
under
the
reclamation
law
when
the
payments
are
made
upon
a
contract
there
are
some
indication
of
how
much
you're
going
to
pay
and
when
you
were
done
in
the
payment
of
it
and
that
had
a
twofold
place
in
the
case
for
the
reason
that
under
one
provision
of
the
reclamation
laws
when
half
of
the
cost
to
be
repaid
by
the
farmer
or
paid
the
acreage
limitation
is
no
longer
applicable
under
another
section
of
the
reclamation
act
when
the
full
amount
is
paid
off,
it
is
payable
by
agriculture,
the
acreage
limitation
is
no
longer
applicable.
so
we
ask,
when
do
we
know
and
by
what
yardstick
do
we
know
of
the
credit
and
we
were
told
it
is
not
a
repayment
contract.
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
give
you
credit
for
what
you
have
paid
and
the
united
states
has
the
right
in
perpetuity
to
continue
to
charge
for
water
above
all
and
then
and
even
take
that
money
and
use
it
to
construct
another
project
elsewhere.
well
gentlemen,
i
think
you
can
realize
that
both
of
us
in
the
west
are
used
to
billing
with
water
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
pertinent
for
the
land
that
the
water
right
is
permanent
as
the
basis
of
our
economy
when
you're
confronted
with
that
sort
of
a
situation,
we
were
completely
dumbfounded
because
of
the
impact
to
format
on
your
land,
your
value,
what
have
you,
the
answer
--
the
soft
answer
if
i
may
characterize
it
as
such
that
was
given
to
us
is
that,
well
do
you
think
that
the
united
states
government
would
take
the
water
from
an
existing
project
and
move
it
to
another.
well,
we
found
in
the
record
inquiries
made
by
some
of
the
congressmen
to
the
officials
of
the
bureau
of
the
reclamation
of
the
fact
that
they
asserted
the
right
to
do
just
that.
and
consequently,
we
were
effaced
with
that
sort
of
a
situation.
now,
so
far
as
the
acreage
limitation
proposition
that
is
merely
an
incident
that
is
used
as
the
big
talking
point
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
it
may
have
a
popular
appeal
and
i
am
not
doing
that
to
be
critical
of
them.
we
can
see
that
to
be
an
incidental
fact
and
that
the
water
right
situation
as
the
predominant
factor
that
we're
interested
in
preserving.
this
comes
after
we
learned
of
what
the
situation
was
with
respect
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
what
we
want
to
know
that
when
we
have
a
piece
of
land
and
it's
within
a
district.
and
that
district
has
a
contract
for
water
that
the
district
and
the
landowners
within
that
district
have
a
permanent
and
perpetual
right
subject
only
to
continued
beneficial
use
and
need
for
it
and
that
it
is
the
pertinence
of
a
land
and
cannot
be
taken
away
and
think
could
be
somewhere
else.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
has
any
relation
to
the
160-acre
proposition.
i
think
that's
an
entirely
separate
proposition.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
the
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
we
are
contesting
it
in
this
contract.
but,
as
i
submit
the
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
it
should
not
be
confused
with
the
other
because
they
are
entirely
separable.
although
the
right
to
water
is
a
basis
of
the
claim
that
they're
taking
something
away
from
the
land
and
if
i
can
get
to
the
point
of
the
--
why
these
lands
have
that
water
right
then
i
think
maybe
i
can
demonstrate
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
well
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
i
had
--
i
hadn't
stated
that
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
warren.
i
hadn't
stated
that
and
probably
i
should
clear
that
up
now.
the
project
started
out
as
i
indicated
and
then
it
was
discovered
that
there
were
some
question
as
to
the
legality
of
the
appropriations
for
the
project
and
the
congress
passed
an
act
in
which
they
stated
that
they
reauthorized
the
central
valley
project
as
a
reclamation
project.
now,
the
reauthorization
i
think
was
to
take
care
of
that
possible
argument.
but
at
that
time,
there's
no
argument
but
what
congress
said
they
were
reauthorizing
it
or
authorizing
it
as
you
may
please
as
a
reclamation
project
of
the
united
states.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
well
personally,
i
think
they
are
but
i
don't
think
its
material
to
this
case
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
i
think
probably
you
may
have
to
in
connection
with
the
question
of
water
rights.
because
i
think
that
the
question
of
state
procedure
and
what
recognition
congress
has
given
to
that
state
procedure
which
is
a
subject
which
mr.
rockwell
will
touch
on
is
something
that
you're
going
to
have
to
consider
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
only
to
--
not
in
the
sense
that
are
discussed
by
counsel
and
if
i
--
i
may
digress
at
this
point,
although
i
--
i
hope
i
won't
use
my
time
up
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
all
right.
thank
you.
that's
not
the
point,
i
welcome
your
questions
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
but
i
still
have
a
story
to
tell
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
and
i'd
like
to
finish
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
it
now.
the
remark
has
been
made
by
the
solicitor
and
is
also
echoed
throughout
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general.
but
whatever
these
waters
are
that
whether
in
the
state
of
california,
wherever
they
may
be,
that
is
of
no
moment
who
owns
them,
whether
the
state
of
california
or
an
irrigation
district
or
a
private
owner
owns
them
because
they
conceive
of
some
overriding
federal
power
possibly
constitutional,
probably
not,
that
says
that
they
can
take
these
waters.
now,
they
say
that
they
have
to
pay
for
them.
but
the
end
of
their
argument
is
this,
not
that
they
have
to
condemn
them
but
all
they
have
to
do
is
walk
in
and
take
possession
in
there
and
if
for
chance,
the
landowner
or
the
person
having
the
right,
doesn't
bring
his
suit
with
any
time
or
doesn't
file
an
injunction
proceeding
to
stop
them
from
going
ahead
until
they
have
followed
the
orderly
process
of
condemnation
that
then
they're
securing
that
right,
that's
the
end
result
of
the
type
of
right
that
they're
talking
about
and
i'm
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
a
right.
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
united
states
might
not,
under
constitutional
powers,
and
under
some
congressional
direction
which
i
don't
think
exists
today,
come
in
and
condemn
all
the
water
rights
of
individuals
within
the
state.
now,
i
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
they
could
come
in
and
condemn
the
water
rights
of
the
state
of
california.
i'm
not
going
to
conceive
that.
but
nevertheless,
that
is
the
distinction
between
what
they're
arguing
and
what
we're
arguing.
and
--
and
finally,
proceed
now
in
trying
to
get
back
to
this
point.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
when
these
contracts
were
presented,
they
finally
reached
--
a
--
a
point
where
they
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
district
securities
commission
of
the
state
of
california.
now,
that
is
the
agency
of
the
state
of
california
had
created,
five
members
occupying
official
positions
within
the
state
whose
job
is
to
approve
or
reject
these
contracts
and
bonds
that
the
districts
may
be
offering.
and
their
function
is
to
determine
the
feasibility
from
an
operating
standpoint
of
financial
feasibility.
and
when
these
contracts
came
before
the
district
securities
commission
of
california
as
is
evidenced
by
the
order
in
the
ivanhoe
case,
the
commission
took
the
position
that
these
contracts
with
respect
to
acreage
limitation
and
with
respect
to
water
rights
were
not
desirable
contracts
but
took
the
position
that
the
function
of
the
securities
commission
was
not
judicial
and
that
they
should
pass
that
on
to
the
court.
and
that
conditional
order,
so
that
it
might
go
on
was
then
made
by
the
district
securities
commission
with
the
admonition
of
their
disagreement
with
it.
disagreement
being
on
legal
grounds
and
also
upon
practical
grounds
of
the
impossibility
and
impracticability
of
the
enforcement
and
application
of
the
acreage
limitation
and
the
fact
that
the
water
rights
which
to
us
are
sacred
and
must
be
in
perpetuity
and
must
be
a
pertinent
to
your
land.
after
that
had
been
done,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
rendered
an
opinion
on
the
question
of
the
validity
under
california
law
of
the
very
act
that
the
appellants
were
referred
to,
to
what
would
they
called
the
federal
cooperation
act
which
is
they
act
if
they
say
gives
irrigation
districts
authority
to
sign
a
contract
to
distribute
water
in
any
manner
provided
for
by
the
federal
government.
the
attorney
general
of
california
determined
in
that
opinion
that
the
federal
cooperation
act
insofar
as
that
imposed
or
--
or
insofar
as
that
gave
authority
to
an
irrigation
district
to
discriminate
among
its
landowners
in
the
quantity
of
land
that
they
could
own
was
an
invalid
act
under
the
law
of
state
of
california
having
no
uniformity
of
--
of
application
and
that
it
violated
the
provisions
of
the
california
constitution.
the
next
up
in
the
procedure
was
the
filing
of
the
--
of
the
validation
suit
by
ivanhoe
which
was
followed
by
the
madera
case.at
the
time
that
that
came
up,
the
attorney
general
of
california
joined
in
the
case
voluntarily
upon
the
basis
of
the
invalidity
of
the
contract
as
seen
by
the
attorney
general
then
on
two
bases,
one,
the
question
of
the
water
right
and
two,
the
question
of
the
acreage
limitation.
the
case
was
about
ready
to
proceed
to
trial
when
the
new
attorney
general
came
in
and
asked
leave
to
file
an
amended
answer.
in
that
amended
answer,
the
attorney
general
set
up
the
fact
that
the
water
within
the
state
of
california
was
the
property
of
the
state
of
california
held
in
trust
for
the
state
of
california
for
the
benefit
of
the
users.
now,
there
is
much
in
the
briefs
and
something
has
been
said
in
oral
argument
condemning
of
our
supreme
court
of
california
for
its
reference
to
the
so-called
trust
theory.
if
you
will
turn
to
the
portions
of
the
amended
answer
of
the
state
of
california
in
this
record,
you
will
find
that
the
state
of
california
itself
through
its
present
counsel
were
the
ones
that
planned
the
trust
theory
and
also
alleged
that
the
filings
by
the
director
of
finance
upon
these
waters
were
such
of
such
a
nature
as
to
give
to
these
people
within
these
districts
to
be
served,
a
water
right
which
was
held
was
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
those
landowners
and
of
those
districts.
following
that
and
before,
the
california
supreme
court
had
passed
upon
the
appeal
before
it
the
attorney
general
of
california
wrote
another
opinion
having
to
do
with
relative
water
rights
between
certain
areas
in
california
in
which
he
characterized
the
holding
of
these
water
rights
by
the
state
as
being
held
in
trust.
and
i
do
want
to
call
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
this
whole
trust
theory
and
the
very
unkind
language
contained
in
the
briefs
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
which
are
charged
to
the
california
supreme
court
stem
from
their
own
pleadings
and
their
own
opinions.
and
i
think
it
comes
with
an
ill
grace
under
that
circumstance
for
them
to
take
that
position
as
to
the
california
supreme
court.
now
on
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
well,
we
tried
to
get
him
to
say
something
about
it
in
our
reply
brief
so
that
in
his
reply
brief,
he
could
make
some
mention.
we
call
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
theory,
pointed
out
the
particular
paragraphs,
pointed
out
the
opinion
in
which
the
attorney
general
had
designated
the
holding
by
the
state
as
being
--
of
water
as
being
in
trust
and
we
have
no
comment,
whatsoever,
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellants.
now,
if
they
have
some
time
left,
possibly
they'll
clarify.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
they
have
--
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
get
any
denial
out
of
them.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
the
first
attorney
general
on
the
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
i
think
--
if
it's
the
amended
answer,
it's
the
one
in
which
the
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
it
--
that
is
the
one
in
which
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
that's
right.
that
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
well,
i
can't
--
i
can't
answer
it
categorically
for
this
reason
that
in
the
--
as
the
briefs
in
the
california
supreme
court,
they
took
one
position
on
the
legal
matters.
in
the
opening
briefs
before
this
court,
they
took
opposite
positions
on
it.
and
in
the
reply
brief,
they
have
straddled
the
fence
and
taken
both
positions.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
yes,
they
did
in
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
this
respect.
now,
let
me
make
myself
clear
because
i
don't
want
to
be
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
--
misunderstood
on
that.
in
the
california
supreme
court,
they
were
avowed
advocates
of
160-acre
rule.
in
the
california
supreme
court,
they
were
avowed
advocates
of
the
fact
that
the
water
laws
of
california
gave
to
these
landowners
a
permanent
and
a
pertinent
water
right.
now,
they
--
you
don't
find
that
and
you
find
the
contrary
in
their
brief
before
this
court.
and
they
do
it
upon
a
different
theory
or
maybe
it's
a
change
of
legal
theory
but
it
--
it
is
an
entirely
different
result
to
us
because
water
rights
in
our
country
rely
from
them.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
well,
are
they
talking
about
the
same
water?
mr.
harry
w.
horton
yes,
they're
talking
about
the
same
water.
i
see
my
time
has
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
all
right.
mr.
harry
w.
horton
that's
right.
now,
may
i
--
may
i
try
as
shortly
as
i
can
towards
my
position
on
respect
to
jurisdiction.
the
california
supreme
court
said
with
respect
to
the
acreage
limitation
is
this.
that
legislation
in
california
must
be
uniform,
a
general
legislation
and
it
must
be
of
uniform
application.
counsel
has
said
that
the
california
supreme
court
nowhere
has
cited,
section
11
of
article
1
of
the
state
of
california.
but
if
he
will
take
a
look
at
the
case
of
the
city
of
pasadena
versus
stimson
that
was
cited
for
the
california
court
in
page
--
turn
to
--
i've
forgotten
the
page
now,
in
it
you'll
see
that
they
did
refer
to
that
plus
one
other
section
of
the
california
constitution,
section
25
of
article
4,
subdivision
33
which
is
to
the
same
general
tenor.
so
apparently,
counsel
hasn't
even
read
the
case
of
pasadena
against
stimson
because
that
is
the
case
that's
specifically
tied
after
the
california
constitution
and
no
other.
now,
what
the
california
court
said
was
that
an
irrigation
district
in
the
state
of
california
could
not
--
or
rather
let
me
put
it
this
way.
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california
could
not
pass
legislation
which
would
authorize
an
irrigation
district
to
discriminate
in
the
delivery
of
water
regardless
of
its
source
--
didn't
make
any
difference
where
this
word
came
from,
on
the
basis
to
how
many
acres
of
the
land
the
man
owns.
and
they
said
they
not
only
did
not
do
it
and
if
they
had
tried
to
do
it,
and
that
was
the
language
in
the
fact,
it
was
invalid,
and
the
further
and
more
pointed
proposition
was
that
the
legislature
of
california
had
passed
the
validation
act
which
purported
to
validate
all
previous
contracts
and
the
california
supreme
court
said
at
page
59
of
its
decision
as
contained
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
they
couldn't
have
passed
an
act
in
specific
language
authorizing
an
irrigation
district
to
discriminate
between
its
landowners
and
deliver
water
on
the
basis
of
the
amount
of
acres
that
a
man
owns.
so,
insofar
as
the
acreage
limitation,
it's
a
pure
and
simple
proposition
that
the
california
court
has
said
what
california
law
is.
they
weren't
even
discussing
federal
law
at
that
stage
of
the
case.
now
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
your
question
encompasses
implications
that
i
don't
--
and
i
know
what
you're
trying
to
get
at
and
let
me
answer
it
in
this
way
if
i
can
--
mr.
harry
w.
horton
well,
i
--
if
i
may
answer
it
--
this
question.
what
the
california
court
in
my
opinion
held
was
this.that
if
the
california
legislature
said
that
irrigation
districts
may
deliver
water
only
to
persons
who
do
not
own
160-acre
land
that
was
of
general
application
over
the
entire
state,
we'd
have
one
question.
now
here,
what
they
held
was
that
the
legislature
couldn't
say
that
an
irrigation
district
could
do
that
as
simply
as
the
people
who
might
have
had
a
contract
that
was
carried.
now,
they
didn't
put
that
on
the
basis
of
federal
law.
they
put
that
on
the
basis
solely
of
the
power
of
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
california.
now,
i
want
to
comment
on
another
situation
on
jurisdiction.
in
the
government
code
and
we've
cited
this
in
our
brief,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
property
by
the
federal
government
in
the
united
states
has
reserved
to
itself
by
specific
legislation,
the
right,
power
and
jurisdiction
to
administer
the
waters
within
the
state
of
california
and
that
happened
in
1955,
i
believe.
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
may
i
take
a
moment
to
go
to
this
question
of
water?
we
have
a
--
an
extended
hearing
on
the
question
of
what
california
water
law
was
and
as
to
whether
or
not
the
filings
by
the
director
of
finance
of
these
applications
to
appropriate
coupled
with
the
succeeding
events
of
the
construction
of
the
works
and
everything
else
vested
in
these
landowners,
ex-district
and
the
landowners
therein
a
water
right
that
was
existent
and
was
in
the
nature
of
a
real
property
right
that
it
was
entitled
to
protection
by
injunction
and
other
proceedings.
so
there,
the
court
passed
on
that,
said
that
there
was
a
right
under
the
california
water
line
and
all
they
did
was
accept
what
have
been
said
by
this
court
in
the
gerlach
case
to
the
effect
that
the
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1922
was
applicable
and
as
my
co-counsel
will
point
out
to
you,
congress
has
reiterated
that
in
1952
and
reiterated
it
in
1956.
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
have
more
time
to
--
to
hit
this
jurisdictional
question.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
