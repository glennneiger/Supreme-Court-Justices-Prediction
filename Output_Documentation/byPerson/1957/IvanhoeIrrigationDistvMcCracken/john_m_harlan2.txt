could
i
ask
you
a
question,
i
just
wanted
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
wanted
to
get
the
--
to
make
sure
i'm
aboard
--
being
with
your
argument.
did
i
understand
it,
what
you're
arguing
is
that
the
california
decision
properly
read
depends
wholly
on
the
construction
of
federal
statutes
and
hence,
if
the
california
court
was
wrong,
it
should
lead
to
the
reversal
of
the
judgment,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
distinguished
from
your
adversary's
argument
that
what
the
california
court
really
held
was
that
under
california
law
these
california
irrigation
districts
were
not
authorized
to
contract
with
the
government.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
which
case,
the
federal
government
--
this
court
at
least
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
except
to
send
the
case
back
or
perhaps
send
the
case
back.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
abreast.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
very
clear.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
was
equally
fair
in
my
own
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
it
could.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
your
argument
reaches
way
beyond
jurisdiction,
doesn't
it?
it
reaches
into
relief
because
i
would
assume
that
you
might
--
you
might
have
jurisdiction
in
some
federal
question
here
but
if
there
was
one,
but
that
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
we
could
give
you
the
relief
that
you're
talking,
put
forward.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
reversal.
