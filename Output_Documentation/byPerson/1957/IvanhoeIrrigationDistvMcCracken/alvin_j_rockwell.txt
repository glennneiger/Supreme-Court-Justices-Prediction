mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
if
the
court
please.
i
will
say
a
little
something
about
jurisdiction
in
passing.
i
would
like
tostart
off
as
i
had
intended
to
anyway,
by
picking
up
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
what
is
involved
here
by
way
of
contract.
now,
i
share
with
mr.
davis'
desire
to
simplify
the
issues
here.and
it
seems
to
me
the
simplest
starting
point
in
the
world
is
the
provision
of
the
1926
federal
statute
which
provides
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
shall
proceed
solely
by
way
of
contract,
no
regulatory
power,
solely
by
way
of
contract,
contract
with
whom?
this
is
the
1926
federal
act
with
irrigation
districts
organized
under
state
law,
and
that
the
contract
shall
be
subjected
to
validation
in
judicial
proceedings.
now,
answering
a
question
which
justice
douglas
put
earlier,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
itself
has
always
construed
the
1926
act
to
require
validation
proceedings
in
state
courts.
and
the
ivanhoe
contract,
the
provision
in
point
appearing
in
the
record
at
4142,
provides
that
the
district
shall
go
ahead,
start
validation
proceedings
and
appeal
the
case,
if
necessary
to
what
court?
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
california.
so
i
say
it
comes
down
to
this
that
the
federal
government,
by
its
own
election,
has
elected
to
proceed
by
way
of
contract.
its
--
it
takes
two
to
make
a
bargain.
the
federal
law
says
nothing
about
the
--
the
authority
of
a
state
irrigation
district.
it
leaves
that
entirely
up
to
the
state
law.
so
that
on
jurisdiction,
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
or
not,
whether
a
federal
question
is
presented
or
not
in
the
last
analysis
or
maybe
in
the
first
analysis,
it
all
goes
back
to
what
are
the
powers
of
an
irrigation
district
under
california
law.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
but
if
you
don't
mind,
i
won't
look
up
the
sections
again.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
i'm
sure
i've
read
them
but
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
i
do
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
i
do
--
i
do
as
justice
gibson
exactly
what
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
did
with
him
in
this
particular
instance.
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
that
is
the
court,
construed
the
word
“applicable”
as
it
appears
in
a
california
statute.
and
construing
it,
they
said
this
particular
federal
law
is
not
applicable.
the
matter
was
argued
in
brief
and
--
and
went
--
gone
into
to
the
fullest
extent,
and
that
is
the
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
i
do,
sir.
now,
i
--
again
i'm
not
going
to
dwell
upon
jurisdiction
but
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
a
sentence
which
appears
in
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
let
me
read
you
the
one
sentence
and
then
i'll
go
on
with
my
argument
tying
it
in.
at
page
35
of
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
in
this
case,
the
sentence
appears,
and
i
--
i
hope
the
court
will
listen
to
it
carefully,
“the
california
court
has
now
determined
that
the
160-acre
limitation
and
the
repayment
provisions
of
the
contracts
are
inconsistent
with
state
law,
requiring
the
proportion
of
distribution
of
water
for
irrigation,
california
water
code
section
22250,
and
the
right
of
landowners
to
receive
irrigation
water.”
that
closes
the
quotation.
now,
that's
exactly,
of
course,
our
position
and
has
been
since
last
june.
the
government
brief
then
on
the
same
page
goes
on
to
argue
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
not
free
under
federal
law
to
apply
state
law
because
they
say
federal
law
somehow
has
occupied
the
field,
although
that's
not
their
exact
expression.
and
they
say
that
the
federal
government,
i'm
referring
to
the
united
states'
brief,
has
the
power
to
impose,
and
i
quote
the
words
“to
impose”
the
disputed
contractual
provisions
now,
where
it
issued.
what
they're
saying
is,
that
we
don't
care
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
thought
were
said.
“the
united
states
has
the
power
to
impose”,
those
are
the
government's
words,
the
disputed
contractual
provisions.
now,
it's
a
queer
business,
i
submit,
that
when
you
talk
about
the
federal
government
having
power
to
impose
a
contract,
and
yet,
that
is
what
their
argument
comes
down
to,
and
i
want
to
address
the
rest
of
the
time
that
i
have
to
--
to
the
question,
has
congress
elected
to
impose
contractual
provisions
on
california
irrigation
district?
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
page
--
i
read
from
the
page
35
and
the
title
that
has
“to
impose”,
sir,
is
on
page
49
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
it's
the
black-lettered
title.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
no
--
what
i
read
from.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
the
sentence
that
i
quoted
was
on
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
page
35.
now,
has
congress
imposed,
first,
and
then
would
congress
have
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
impose
factual
provisions
under
the
powers
available
to
it?
i
answer
both
of
those
questions
in
the
negative.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
i
think
that
it's
--
it's
the
latter,
and
i
think
the
argument
made
within
--
that
is
by
the
letter,
to
impose
against
california
law.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
that's
what
i
think
it
may
be.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
indeed,
it
is,
sir.
indeed
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
it
is.
in
other
words,
it's
not
really
attaching
condition
to
a
gratuity.
it's
imposing
something
by
force
of
--
of
avow.
now,
what
did
congress
intend
here?
as
has
been
brought
out,
there
is
a
question
of
--
of
reconciliation
if
--
if
possible,
this
section
5
of
the
original
act,
section
7
which
deals
with
condemnation,
and
section
8
which
talks
about
the
inviolability
of
state
law.
and
i
think
those
all
can
be
reconciled
and
a
key
point
to
the
reconciliation
is
the
fact
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
that
the
federal
government,
the
congress
has
elected
to
proceed
by
way
of
contract.
i
think
contract
perhaps
is
the
most
important
word
in
this
whole
litigation.
now,
section
8,
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
1902,
says
that
nothing
in
the
act,
and
i
now
quote,
“shall
be
construed
as
affecting
or
intended
to
affect
or
to
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
laws
of
any
state
or
territory
relating
to
the
control,
appropriation,
use,
or
distribution
of
water
used
in
irrigation.”
that
is
still
on
the
books
and
it
has
been
reaffirmed
verbatim
by
the
congress
as
late
as
1956
in
the
act
of
july
2nd,
section
4.
likewise,
it's
consistent
with
this
federal
concern
about
leaving
to
state
jurisdiction,
the
matter
of
water
for
irrigation
is
the
act
of
july
10,
1952,
never
much
mentioned
by
the
government
which
provides
that
in
any
case
where
the
united
states
is
joined
as
a
party
involving
state
water
rights,
the
united
states,
and
i
now
quote,
“shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
right
to
plead
that
the
state
laws
are
inapplicable
or
that
the
united
states
is
not
amenable
thereto
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty.”
now,
there
are
many
other
statutes
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
all
and
the
same
thing,
all
showing
that
so
far
as
irrigation
is
concerned,
congress
wants
to
leave
that
up
to
the
states.
so
far
as
appropriation,
control,
use,
or
distribution
of
the
waters
are
concerned,
the
navigational
servitude,
i
might
add
right
here,
is
not
involved
in
these
cases.
nobody
contends
that
it
is.
now,
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
summarized
in
our
brief,
our
main
brief,
page
55
to
60,
and
every
decision
which
has
dealt
with
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
has
given
that
section
full
force
and
the
effect
without
qualification.
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
used
his
opinion
in
the
mason
tax
--
company
against
tax
commission
which
involved
the
building
of
the
grand
coulee
dam
on
the
columbia
river.
we
discussed
in
our
brief
the
california
oregon
power
company
against
the
beaver
cement
company
case
which
dealt
with
oregon,
their
water
law
reserving
with
the
state
the
right
to
cut
down
riparian
rights
of
a
grantee
of
the
united
states.we
discussed
ickes
against
fox,
nebraska
against
wyoming
in
which
the
opinion
was
written
by
justice
douglas
and
finally,
the
gerlach
case.
now,
ickes
against
fox
which
dealt
with
a
reclamation
problem
uses
language
which
i
think
is
so
important
that
i
should
call
the
court's
attention
to
it
as
expressing
--
pressed
as
i
am
for
time.
in
that
case,
which
came
up
on
the
pleadings
to
this
court
crucial
to
the
decision
was
the
following
language
of
this
court
and
i'm
going
to
quote
from
page
57
of
our
brief,
that's
300
u.s.at
pages
94,
95.
here's
what
this
court
said,
“although
the
government
diverted,
stored,
and
distributed
the
water,
the
contention
of
petitioner
that
thereby
ownership
of
the
water
or
water
rights
became
vested
in
the
united
states
is
not
well
founded.”
appropriation
was
made
not
for
the
use
of
the
government
but
under
the
reclamation
law
for
the
use
of
the
landowners
and
by
the
terms
of
the
law
and
of
the
contract
already
referred
to,
the
water
rights
became
the
property
of
the
landowners
wholly
distinct
and
also
if
the
court
would
note
this
language,
wholly
distinct
from
the
property
right
of
the
government
in
the
irrigation
works.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
yes,
the
effect
of
section
8.
and
now,
in
nebraska
against
wyoming,
this
very
language,
this
whole
passage
was
quoted
in
the
court's
opinion.
in
ickes
against
fox,
this
court
on
the
pleadings
held
that
--
held
that
there
was
a
justiciable
issue
and
sent
the
matter
back
for
trial
when
it
was
claimed
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
unlawfully
was
attempting
to
take
water
from
one,
washington
irrigation
district
and
give
it
to
another.
now
again,
the
gerlach
case
referred
to
this
very
important
water
amendment
in
the
california
constitution
which
the
court
below
referred
to,
adopted
in
1928.
and
the
gerlach
opinion
of
this
court
referred
to
this
1928
amendment
as
and
i
now
quote,
“that
california's
basic
water
law
to
which
the
federal
reclamation
act
defers.”
now,
if
the
court
please.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
largely
proceeded
in
a
constricted
form
--
largely
proceeded
in
constricted
form
in
view
of
this
section
8.
they
have
told
congress,
yes,
about
what
they
were
doing
under
acreage
limitations.
in
the
same
breadth,
they
have
assured
congress
that
they
were
respecting
state
law
when
it
came
to
the
appropriation,
control,
use,
and
distribution
of
water.
there's
something
here
that
they
never
reconciled
in
their
own
reports
to
congress.
we
quote
it
in
our
brief,
the
gerlach
opinion
of
this
court,
quotes
verbatim,
“two
sets
of
assurances
given
to
congress
by
the
secretary
of
--
of
agriculture.”
in
the
record
in
this
case,
at
page
101,
there's
a
copy
of
a
letter
written
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
then
mr.
chapman,
to
attorney
general
brown,
in
which
he
assures
attorney
general
brown
that
the
united
states
will
only
obtain
its
water
pursuant
to
california
law
by
appropriation
and
the
like.
now,
our
brief
mentioned
something
rather
interesting.
a
hearing
at
fresno,
california
before
the
california
state
water
rights
board
that
hearing
in
fresno
is
going
on
right
this
minute,
allowing
for
the
--
the
difference
of
time.
it's
going
on
today.
and
in
that
hearing,
the
united
states
of
america
acting
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
under
california
law,
is
processing
its
applications
to
appropriate
california
waters
for
the
central
valley
project.
that's
right.
that's
all
that
they've
done.
and
what
kind
of
an
order
will
that
state
board
issue?
we
have
copies
of
the
orders
in
our
briefs.it
will
say,
“yes,
you
may
have
the
water.”
but
the
owners
of
the
water
will
be
the
--
the
landowners,
the
users,
and
the
state
district
and
you
must
proceed
in
conformity
with
state
law.
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation
accepts,
permits
on
that
basis.
now,
in
this
--
in
the
opinion
on
the
gerlach
case,
this
court
said
something
which
i
think
that
has
application
here.
the
gerlach
opinion
observed
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
and
i
quote,
“has
at
all
times
pursued
a
course
impossible
to
reconcile
with
the
present
contentions
of
the
government,”
meaning,
the
department
of
justices'
position
in
that
case.
now,
i'm
not
trying
to
score
any
debating
point
whoever
said
what,
when
or
what
not
is
essentially
unimportant,
but
i
do
submit
to
the
court
that
the
statement
of
this
court
in
the
gerlach
case
applies
here
because
i
think
some
of
the
arguments
made
in
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
would
give
one
no
inkling.
that's
the
very
time
that
this
was
written.
the
bureau
is
going
ahead
under
state
law
in
california
to
appropriate
state
waters.
now,
let
me
go
ahead
and
turn
to
appellants
here.
in
our
main
brief
here,
we
chided,
gently
i
think,
the
appellants
for
not
discussing
these
various
decisions
of
this
court
which
ruled
upon
the
force
of
section
8;
the
tax
commission
case,
the
beaver
cement
case,
ickes
against
fox,
and
so
on.
and
the
--
the
issue
was
squarely
joined
between
all
of
united
states.
i
think,
at
almost
every
point
in
their
reply,
appellants
with
--
certainly
with
candor
said,
“no,
we
didn't
discuss
the
case
just
because
in
our
view,
they
are
irrelevant.”
that
was
the
word
they
used.
now,
to
me,
it's
breathtaking
that
those
cases
winding
up
for
the
gerlach
case
that
it
could
be
considered
by
anybody
as
irrelevant.
this
is
a
water
case.
the
decision
of
this
court
has
said
that
state
law
controls
among
other
things,
distribution
of
the
water.
our
friends
say
the
cases
are
irrelevant.
well,
what's
their
--
what's
their
reasoning?
what's
their
argument
here?
they
don't
seem
to
deny
that
the
united
states,
if
it
wants
to
get
the
water
for
a
project,
must
appropriate
under
state
law.
but
they
say
having
appropriated
under
state
law
and
having,
going
--
gone
through
all
these
forms
such
as
the
going
out
at
fresno
today.
and
even
though
the
title
to
the
water
it
receives
from
the
state
is
in
trust
or
subject
to
limitations,
once
the
united
states
gets
its
hands
on
the
water,
then
it's
free
of
all
state
restrictions
and
could
obtain
a
title
greater
than
any
other
person
can
obtain
in
the
state.
but,
of
course,
i
suppose
the
immediate
response
is
if
that
is
true,
why
go
through
all
of
the
monkey
business
of
appropriating
under
state
law
in
the
first
place?
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
the
second
reason
is
they
can't
be
true.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
no,
they
say
it's
unimportant,
too,
as
the
title.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
they
--
i
said
that
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
that
they
can
cast
a
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well,
as
to
the
unappropriated
waters
in
the
state,
i
don't
understand
that
they
claimed
title.
as
to
appropriations
that
they
protect,
yes.
they
claimed
title
there,
and
they
claimed
a
greater
title
than
they
can
get
that
under
state
law.
i
think
the
confusion
arises
from
the
question
of
unappropriated
water,
which
is
discussed
at
the
very
end
of
the
government's
brief
and
appropriated
waters.
now
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
i'll
be
glad
to
give
you
my
views
on
that
very
quickly.
i
don't
think
title
is
the
important
thing.
control
is
the
important
thing.
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
doing
in
its
discussion
of
federal
law
was
sweeping
it
away
to
show
that
state
law
determined
the
control,
impressed
the
trust
theory
by
virtue
of
the
state's
control.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
title
as
such
doesn't
interest
me.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
is
what,
sir?
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well,
the
control
that
it's
asserted
by
virtue
of
an
unlimited
use
in
title
once
it
obtains
the
water
under
state
law
is
inconsistent
with
the
trust
theory.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
yes.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
exercised
by
the
state,
yes,
sir,
plus
the
fact
that
it's
never
created
an
irrigation
district
with
any
power
to
enter
into
a
contract
that
would
permit
it
to
discriminate
against
its
own
members,
but
the
one
buttresses
the
other.
now
--
now
what
is
--
i
was
trying
to
tell
you,
give
you
my
view
of
how
the
--
how
the
argument
progresses
here.
how
can
they
--
how
can
our
friends
argue
that,
yes,
you
have
to
appropriate
one
way
but
you
can
always
--
then
you
claim
a
higher
title
than
you
get.
well,
it
--
it
seems
to
depend
largely
upon
the
theory
that
under
the
reclamation
act,
the
united
states
has
the
power
of
condemnation.
so
they
say,
“well,
let's
not
fuss
around
about
what
kind
of
title
we
get.
after
all,
we
in
the
united
states
is
that
we
can
always
condemn.”
power
of
eminent
domain
solves
all
the
problems.
you
heard
mr.
davis
concerning
that
argument.
it's
developed
very
fully
in
the
brief
for
the
appellants.
well
now,
this
is
ingenious,
but
can
it
commend
itself
to
this
court?
now,
if
it
does,
it
--
it
has
unlimited
possibilities.
every
challenge
is
to
government
regulation
where
property
is
involved
whether
it
is
the
challenge
be
the
federal
government,
state,
local.
it
can
always
be
turned
into
a
condemnation
case.
and
the
government
says,
“well,
we
haven't
yet
proceeded
to
condemn.”
they
haven't
here.
but
after
all,
we
have
the
power
of
condemnation
and
therefore,
don't
worry.
just
to
let
us
regulate
you.
and
if
you
think
that
you
have
any
recourse,
go
to
the
court
of
claims
or
go
to
somewhere
else
in
some
other
proceeding.
but,
of
course,
that
that
can't
be
reconciled
with
section
8.
there's
plenty
of
place
consistent
with
section
8,
consistent
with
state
jurisdiction
over
waters
for
eminent
domain,
plenty
of
places
for
it.
the
government
had
that
power
when
it
built
the
friant-kern
canal
and
probably
exercised
it
when
you
get
some
of
the
land
for
the
canal
purposes.
it's
a
useful
power
and
it's
perfectly
reconcilable
with
section
8
without
using
the
power
of
eminent
domain
to
completely
obliterate
the
powers
reserved
to
the
states
under
section
8.
and
likewise,
section
5,
the
160-acre
limitation
is
consistent
with
section
8
so
long
as
it's
understood
that
the
acreage
limitation
may
be
applied
when
it's
consistent
and
permitted
by
state
law.
and,
of
course,
that
ties
it
as
--
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
the
government
here
has
elected
to
proceed
by
way
of
contract
with
state-created
irrigation
districts,
without
making
any
effort
to
endow
those
districts
with
authority
leaving
that
to
the
state.
now,
i
should
proceed,
i
think,
with
the
question
which
to
me
is
as
serious.
suppose
as
it
has
not
done,
congress
had
never
enacted
section
8,
had
never
decided
to
proceed
by
way
of
contract.
suppose
that
congress
as
it
has
not,
had
simply
said,
“all
right,
so
we
have
lots
of
money
and
we'll
get
more.
we're
going
to
come
in
to
california
and
we're
going
to
run
these
works
and
distribute
water
on
our
terms
and
you're
going
to
take
it
on
our
terms.”
would
that
be
constitutional
under
our
federal
constitution,
and
we
say
no.
now,
as
we
understand
the
argument
for
the
appellants
and
for
the
government,
they're
not
saying,
impose
in
any
sense
of,
here's
a
perpetuity,
take
it
or
not.
if
they
were,
i
don't
see
how
they
could
have
appealed
from
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california.
they're
saying
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
wrong
because
under
federal
law,
we
are
directing
you
to
validate
these
contracts
imposed
in
the
sense
that
you
regulated
interstate
commerce
or
draft
men
into
the
army
or
taxes.
now,
we
submit
that
what's
here
involved,
you
understand,
is
simply
an
exercise
of
the
power
to
spend
for
the
general
welfare,
a
very
important
power.
but
that
power
must
be
distinguished
from
the
power
to
regulate
and
coerce
as
we
say
in
our
briefs,
under
the
specifically
designated
powers
of
the
constitution,
which
are
not
here
involved.
under
those
powers,
sure
the
government
can
go
a
very
long
way.
here
it's
the
well
forced
problem.
in
our
brief
we
point
out
that
this
court,
wherever
it
has
been
appropriate
to
do
so,
has
carefully
distinguished
between
what
the
federal
government
can
do
under
the
spending
and
welfare
and
property
disposing
power
if
there
is
such
and
under
the
much
broader
powers
to
regulate
and
coerce
and
so
forth
which
are
not
involved.
now,
we
quote
from
the
butler
case,
both
from
the
court's
opinion
and
from
the
dissenting
opinion,
which
are
to
light
the
in
--
to
light
the
effects
here.
both
say
that
you
cannot
use
the
spending
power
to
coerce
actions
left
to
state
control.
ashwander
against
tennessee,
the
hopkin
saving
association
against
cleary
which
is
a
--
a
case
remarkably
similar
to
the
present
case
where
justice
cardozo,
for
a
unanimous
court,
held
that
under
the
spending
power
which
the
government
there
relied
upon,
federal
law
could
not
permit
to
wisconsin
state
savings
and
loan
associations
to
transmute
themselves
into
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
without
the
consent
of
the
state.
and
the
cardozo
opinion
states
that
this
might
be
permitted
under
a
regulatory
power
of
the
government
such
as
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce,
he
gives
that
example
but
it
may
not
be
permitted
under
the
power
exerted
namely,
the
spending
power.
now,
we
think
it's
probably
so
that
this
court
will
not
get
to
this
constitutional
question
of
what
can
be
done
under
the
welfare
clause
because
congress
seems
to
have
been
so
clear,
in
electing
to
proceed
by
way
of
contract.
if
--
if
the
court
should
get
there,
it's
sufficient
to
say
i
think
that
the
decision
that
the
united
states
under
the
welfare
authority
can
impose
a
contract
against
its
will
on
a
state
irrigation
district
would
go
very
far
towards
obliterating
any
difference
between
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
and
the
power
to
spend
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
for
the
general
welfare.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well,
because
you
see
everything
i've
said
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
very
good.
i
want
to
answer
that.
everything
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
that
i've
been
arguing
about
when
i
came
to
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
government
could
impose
the
contract
has
been
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
finds
a
federal
question.
we
argue
the
merits
as
well
as
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
and
i
certainly
agree
with
you
that
if
this
--
if
you
ever
get
to
the
general
welfare
clause,
there
is
certainly
a
federal
question
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
which
justifies
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
we'd
be
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
yes.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
yes,
because
there,
you
have
the
question
of
what
congress
has
wanted
to
do
under
section
8
and
so
on.
but
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
on
jurisdiction
the
answer
is
this
that
this
point
that
i
made
at
the
outset
that
congress
has
elected
to
proceed
by
way
of
contract
between
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
state
irrigation
district
organized
under
state
law
the
contracts
to
be
validated
by
state
courts.
that
is
a
federal
starting
point
but
it
raises
no
question
substantial
or
anything
else
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
that's
the
language
of
the
law
literally.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well,
i
-
i
think
we
do
have
to
say
this.
we've
never
--
we've
never
said
that
there
weren't
federal
problems
working
around
here.
we
say
that
what
it
boils
down
to
is
a
federal
question
so
simple
as
not
to
amount
to
a
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
because
the
court
of
california
proceeded
by
the
analyzing
of
the
federal
law
to
the
extent
of
sweeping
it
away
to
show
that
the
state
law
are
controlled.
now,
in
conclusion,
let
me
just
say
that
as
has
been
pointed
out,
there
are
other
state
questions
involved
in
these
cases
and
involved
in
all
four
cases,
every
single
one
of
them,
including
the
albonico
and
santa
barbara,
state
questions
which
the
court
below
left
unanswered
in
view
of
the
conclusion,
at
least,
that
the
contracts
were
invalid.
the
albonico
case
not
being
a
validation
case,
but
turning
upon
the
madera
validation
proceeding.
however,
we
trust
that
will
not
become
important.
we
believe
that
--
that
the
appeal
should
be
dismissed
and
the
certiorari
denied
but
we
don't
stop
there.
if
--
if
there
are
federal
questions
of
substance
presented,
fine,
well
and
good.
in
that
case
the
judgments
below,
we
submit,
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
in
my
--
in
my
mind,
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
whether
counsel
have
other
views
--
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
--
how's
that
sir?
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
oh,
yes
sir
it
is.
yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
yes,
while
one
of
the
contracts
provides
for
a
municipal
water
supply,
even
that
contract
also
has
the
acreage
limitation
in
it.
yes,
that
--
that's
it
in
the
santa
barbara
case
also.
mr.
alvin
j.
rockwell
well
--
