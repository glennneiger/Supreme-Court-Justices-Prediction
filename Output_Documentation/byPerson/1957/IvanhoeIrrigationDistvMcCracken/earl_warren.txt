mr.
goldberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldberg,
did
this
court
hold
that
the
united
states
cannot
acquire
the
same
kind
of
title
that
a
private
appropriator
had
acquired?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
differentiate
between
--
between
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
let
us
say
on
the
water
rights
that
it
purchased,
distinguished
from
the
water
rights
that
an
ordinary
individual
would
have
by
appropriation
or
otherwise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
if
they
make
--
they
make
no
--
if
they
make
no
comparison
between
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
private
appropriators,
then
you
need
to
take
your
time,
mr.
goldberg,
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
that's
--
that's
the
reason
that
the
united
states
is
lifted
in
its
office.
is
that
--
is
that
the
portfolio
of
the
opinion
because
of
the
trust
and
not
because
of
the
section
of
the
reclamation
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
both?
all
right.
okay.
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
your
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
state
briefly
the
state
question
left
open,
mr.
goldberg?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
helpful.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
follows
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horton,
i
may
have
--
i
may
have
failed
to
note
what
you
--
what
you
said
but
i
--
i
didn't
recall
that
you
stated
when
and
just
how
this
became
a
reclamation
project
as
distinguished
from
its
original
concept.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
had
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
think
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
would
i
like
to
ask
--
to
ask
you
is
this,
because
of
the
background
that
you
gave
us
before
that,
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
of
california
and
the
united
states
government
are
in
a
different
relationship
then
they
would
be
with
any
other
reclamation
project
where
they
started
from
scratch
in
that
--
in
that
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
--
is
it
material
and
should
we
have
to
consider
it
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
there's
a
title
to
--
is
the
title
to
water
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
won't
take
any
more
of
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
take
--
does
counsel
take
in
an
adverse
stand
here
in
this
court?
does
he
argue
that
what
he
--
what
he
--
put
in
his
answer
was
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rockwell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
claim
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
they
claim
title
--
do
they
claim
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
have
just
said
they
did,
i
understood.
i
understood
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
say
that
they
jumped
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
that
position
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
claim
of
title.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
question
of
title
to
this
water
of
their
irrigation
district
involved
in
this
particular
litigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
control
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
control
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
trust
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
control
by
the
federal
government
inconsistent
with
the
trust
theory
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
is
there
any
difference
between
the
ivanhoe
case
and
the
santa
barbara
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
160--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
acres.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
no
160-acre
problem
in
the
--
in
the
santa
barbara?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
green.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
section
in
the
constitution
was
that
involved
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
had
a
--
i
thought
it
had
a
due
process
clause
but
none
of
equal
protection
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
unless
--
before
you
get
to
that
point,
i
just
like
to
know
if
your
--
your
argument
you've
just
made
takes
you
to
the
point
where
you
say
that
if
the
act
of
congress
does
require
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
make
contracts
limiting
the
distribution
of
this
water
to
acreages
of
160
acres
and
if
a
given
state,
any
state,
refuses
to
permit
the
contract
of
that
kind
that
the
reclamation
service
cannot
function
in
that
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
unless
congress
changes
this
all
policy
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'm
--
i'm
taking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
assumption
that
he's
bound
by
the
--
by
the
federal
law
to
administer
the
act
so
that
the
water
shall
be
distributed
to
acreages
less
than
160
acres.
now,
if
that
--
if
he's
required
to
do
that
and
if
the
state
says
our
irrigation
district
cannot
do
that
then
it's
your
conclusion
or
is
it
your
conclusion
that
the
federal
government
cannot
operate
through
its
reclamation
service
in
that
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
have
the
--
the
reason
i'm
still
interested
in
what
justice
black
has
exists.
as
i
understand
it,
the
-
the
argument
heretofore
has
not
been
made
on
the
--
the
basis
of
any
distinction
between
an
individual
and
the
--
and
the
corporation
or
--
or
an
irrigation
district
but
it's
made
on
--
was
made
on
the
basis
that
california
had
the
absolute
right
to
make
what
disposition
it
desired
of
its
water.
and
if
that
was
true,
why
wouldn't
it
apply
both
to
an
individual
and
to
an
irrigation
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
five
minutes
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

yes.
