justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
qualified
in
only
under
federal
grounds?
it's
indicated
a
little
earlier
that
there
is
--
there
is
a
federal
problem,
that's
the
matter
of
this
court
to
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be
right.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
undue
burden
of
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you
have
initiated
this
litigation
or
litigation
like
it
in
the
federal
district
court
in
california?
are
you
asserting
a
federal
right
or
are
you
resisting
a
denial,
an
obstruction?
so
i
leave
my
first
question
.could
you
--
could
you
bring
any
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
--
you
to
comply
that
mostly
it
could
be
their
equivalent
because
you're
certain
to
get
a
suit
from
the
federal
court,
federal
claim
may
not
be
involved
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
lawful
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
lawful
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
form
of
what
justice
douglas
had
suggested
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
form
of
declaratory
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
those
provisions
were
the
same
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
original
act
included?
justice
felix
frankfurter
given
the
relation
of
the
two
sections?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
the
--
the
bills
came
up
and
they
were
voted
down?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
could
make
strong
argument
to
fill
the
need
of
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
back
to
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
do
you
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
in
the
course
of
all
60
odd
years
(inaudible)
in
this
provision,
what
has
been
the
administrative
practice.
in
other
words,
what
project
has
been
financed
or
regulated
by
the
department
of
the
interior
with
an
application
of
the
160-acre
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
first,
first,
in
the
action
of
the
secretary,
has
any
project
do
not
have
that
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
those
project
or
--
or
projects
subject
expressly,
manifesting
that
the
property
of
the
interior
and
bureau
of
reclamation
policy
has
been
before
congress
in
some
form
or
rather
in
the
way
in
which
we
indicated
(inaudible)
before
congress,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
you
say
that
there
is,
within
the
term
that
has
meaning
to
you,
an
administrative
practice
to
apply
it
except
--
with
the
exception
you
just
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
of
the
department
of
the
interior
from
time
to
time
had
occasion
either
explicitly
to
report
some
of
these
projects
or
to
lay
them
before
the
congress
as
the
basis
of
future
appropriation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can
you
--
is
there
any
(inaudible)
which
our
committee
who
feels
(inaudible)
these
bills,
the
entire
proposals
to
modify
or
to
exempt
through
reports
made
by
congress

to
congress
charging
them
with
knowledge
of
this
interpretation
of
their
statute.
does
the
--
is
the
demand
on
which
you
relied
a
little
while
ago
or
which
you
brought
to
your
support
by
exempting
legislation,
is
it
fairly
related
to
a
report
by
the
secretary
telling
congress
that
they're
enforcing
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
own
property,
meaning
the
money?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
part
of
that
water
entered
into
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
any
--
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
davis,
is
the
--
is
the
federal
government
by
virtue
of
congressional
legislation,
the
member
of
the
executive
department
under
a
duty
to
do
something?
are
these
--
are
these
mandatory
appropriation
acts
and
directory
--
is
this
directory
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
could
have
--
could
the
executive
department
of
this
government
call
its
own
and
do
nothing
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
does
nothing,
could
it
be
mandamus?
don't
forget
about
jurisdictional
or
judicial
property.
were
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
if
he
--
and
you,
you
passed
you
go
on
and
move
on
from
--
to
your
satisfaction
that
this
is
a
direction
from
--
from
the
government
to
allow
him
to
impose
the
160
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
therefore,
if
he
makes
any
contract
and
doesn't
enforce
the
hundred
and
doesn't
provide
for
the
--
for
respect
for
the
160-acre
limitation,
he
would
be
again
there,
wouldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
my
question
a
minute
ago
if
uncle
sam
can
fold
his
arms
and
do
nothing
then
you'll
--
you're
going
to
argue
in
a
minute
that
by
imposing
this
condition
for
which
you
say
the
statutory
authority,
he's
doing
something
that
the
constitution
has
forbidden
although
they
are
under
no
compulsion
by
the
constitution
to
do
this,
is
that
right?
this
isn't
that
--
that
the
united
government
doesn't
have
to
join
in
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
congress
has
provided
legislation,
a
regime,
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
you
say,
to
your
satisfaction
is
merely
carrying
out
what
he's
authorized
to
do
and
is
therefore
imposing
a
condition
to
action
by
the
federal
government,
the
appropriation
of
money
which
it
need
appropriate
which
it
is
free
not
to
appropriate
and
which
you
say
to
appropriate
on
conditions
which
congressionally
is
authorized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
you
go
on
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
add
to
the
constitutional
difficulty,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
said
the
policy
of
160
acres
does
require
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
am
i
wrong
in
assuming
that
on
--
on
the
--
that
the
state
of
the
argument
which
you
have
reached,
the
question
would
be
precisely
to
say
that
congress
in
terms
had
written
out
in
--
in
an
act
that
is
sometimes
with
a
case
who
does
the
kind
of
a
contract
is
one
of
the
secretary
of
interior
design.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
why
do
you
have
to
argue
--
why
do
you
have
to
be
dialectic
about
trying
to
prove
the
secretary's
authority
if
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
contract
is
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we're
really
are
facing
the
question
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
impose
its
condition
to
the
expenditures
of
its
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
this
project.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
something
a
minute
ago,
mr.
davis,
that
--
that
i
didn't
quite
catch
about
what
the
gerlach
case,
from
your
point
of
view,
established
relevant
to
this
--
to
the
problem
now
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
gerlach
case
(inaudible)
question
of
constitutionality
is
it?
whether
it's
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
reclamation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
question
of
whether
congress
to
do
that
except
the
entirety
of
who's
involved,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
possibly
the
earlier
cases
of
some
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
because
you're
construing
the
statute
because
congress
expressed
this
--
left
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
--
may
i
interrupt
with
you
still,
what
does
that
mean
in
--
in
the
concrete
what
you're
interested
in
the
preserving
the
water
right
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
the
160-acre
limitation
is
invalid,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
not
--
are
you
not
contesting
that
limitation
in
this
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
they
drew
the
opposite
conclusions
from
what
you
say
they
profess
to
be
their
theory
--
of
their
theory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
but
--
but
what
--
what
did
the
attorney
general
--
what
was
the
position
he
took
on
the
--
on
the
issue,
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case,
namely,
that
this
contract
was
valid,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
the
amended
answer,
if
i'm
looking
at
the
right
one,
filed
march
30,
1951,
is
that
the
one
you're
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
filed
march
30th,
1951
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
attorney
general
edmund
g.brown,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
mr.
goldberg
was
then
deputy
attorney
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
that
--
in
that
amended
answer,
they
asked
--
as
relief,
they
asked
for
the
same
relief
that
they
asked
for
this
court,
is
that
not
true?
i
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
theory
which
they
--
by
which
they
reached
their
desire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
you
--
some
--
some
opinion
of
mr.
justice
holmes
but
we're
not
concerned
with
legal
theory
but
with
rights.
now,
have
they
--
have
they
urged
different
rights
in
california
supreme
court
from
what
they're
urging
here?
justice
felix

yes.
all
right.

(voice

justice

before

sit
down

justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
hope
that
you
can
draw
in
your
associate's
time
to
say
something
about
the
jurisdictional
question
--
justice

in
which
all
of
these
was
to
be
a
prelude.
justice
felix

are
you
saying

do
i
understand
you
to
say
this
or
that

without
any
regard
to
what
the
statutory
authorizations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
may
be,
without
any
regard
in
assuming
the
statutory
authorization
is
clear,
what
the
power
of
congress
may
be,
that
california
has
disabled
irrigation
districts
from
accepting
whatever
may
be
constitutionally
offered
by
the
united
states
and
there's
no
power
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
impose
that
against
california
law.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
and
therefore,
it
rests
on
the
state
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
assure
i'm
interested
in
jurisdictional
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rockwell,
let
me
take
some
of
your
time.
what
connection
is
there
between
with
what
you
just
said
that
the
scope
of
authority
of
the
irrigation
district
is
to
be
measured
by
what
california
law
defined?
what
do
you
do
with
the
sections
of
the
california
water
code
which
chief
justice

which
he

chief

more
particularly,

haven't

that?
justice

vague

what

you

the

a

this

do
they
say
to
impose
as
against

of
california

from
the

that's
a

(voice

--
justice

all
right.
justice
felix

is
the
--
it's
included
in

but
you

mr.

have
urged
california

equality
of

that

that

justice

i
don'
think

justice

--
that
we
can
either
hold
on
your

in
the
mean
time
you've
let
us

so
go
back
to
the
old
track.
it
was
five
years
in
what
you
said
the
last
two
minutes.
why
isn't
what
you
said
the
last
two
minutes
have
indication
that
there
is
a
federal
question
in
this
case?
justice

you
said

justice
felix

yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
because
even
before
you
get
to
it,
you
get
to
a
construction
--
justice

--
of
what
the
contract
of
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
--
justice
felix

but
in
order
to
determine
whether
(inaudible)
is
bring
this
upon
what
the
state
law
as
you
see
it
required,
is
itself
a
federal
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
--
it's
a
problem
of
construing
a
federal
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
--
excuse
me
--
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
while
ago
that
you
do
not
attack
the
validity
of
the
statute
of
congress
would
authorize
the
making
of
a
--
of
a
--
acreage
limitation
contract,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
--
i
haven't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
included
that
provision.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
you
think
the
provision
--
the
provision
of
the
congressional
act
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
make
an
acreage
limitation
of
--
of
contract
is
as
an
exercise
of
federal
power
forget
the
statement
of
the
--
is
as
an
exercise
of
federal
power
valid,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
a
state
which
authorizes
its
agency
to
add
in
to
such
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
your
objection
if
i
follow
you,
is
not
that
such
a
contract
is
illegal
in
any
sense
of
federal
law
but
that
it
isn't
--
that
the
state
has
power
to
limit
the
contracting
agencies
within
its
control
and
you
say
it
has
denied
that
power
to
the
irrigation
district,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
say
that
on
the
california
law,
the
irrigation
district
cannot
enter
into
such
a
limiting
contract,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
and
therefore,
no
matter
what
the
power
of
the
reclamations
bureau
maybe,
they
can't
have
a
(inaudible)
who
entered
into
that
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
be
able
to
be
in
one
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
your
position
that
you
have
the
right.
i
don't
follow
you
when
you
say
that
it's
now
or
never
because
the
number
of
condemnation
cases
in
which
uncle
sam
doesn't
go
through
the
formality
of
condemnation.
but
there
is
a
taking,
an
implied
agreement
to
repay
and
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely
that
it
is
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
contingent
position.
so
i
understand
from
--
as
i
understood
(inaudible)
they
say
if
indeed
there
is
a
deprivation
here
then
you've
got
a
remedy
by

if
you
don't

it's
now
or
never,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
may
i
interrupt
you?
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
but
may
i
break
into
your
contention
that
(inaudible)
to
answer
all
the
things
that
you
disagree
with.
as
i
understand,
you
haven't
got
much
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
two
questions
and
i
would
like
to
get
a
categorical
answer
to
these
questions.
one,
that
do
you
contend
that
under
federal
law
in
its
entirety
and
the
powers
given
therein
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
federal
government
comes
stupendously
speaking
may
impose
conditions
such
as
are
contained
in
this
contract
against
the
opposition
and
resistance
of
california,
opposition
and
resistance
derived
from
what
it
concedes
to
be
the
limitations
of
the
contracting
power
of
its
irrigation
districts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
question.
since
--
since
you
--
you
don't
have
to
say
yes
or
no
if
it
isn't
involved
(inaudible)
answer.
is
it
your
contention
that
the
chief
claims
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
that
the
irrigation
districts
are
not
empowered,
indeed
are
disabled
by
california
law
from
entering
into
such
a
contract
is
not
so,
that
california
law
does
not
disable
the
irrigation
districts
and
california
law
authorizes
the
irrigation
districts
to
enter
into
the
contract
in
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--your
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
--
have
to
convince
him.
you
have
to
convince
this
court.
