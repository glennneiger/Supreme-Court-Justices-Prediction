mr.
denslow
b.
green
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
before
proceeding
to
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
you
this
afternoon,
i'd
like
to
briefly
summarize
what
our
position
is
on
jurisdiction.
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
our
reading
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
that
what
it
was
talking
about
was
a
contract
that
had
been
executed
by
an
irrigation
district
and
that
a
careful
reading
of
that
decision
will
show
that
what
the
court
held
was
that
an
irrigation
district
did
not
have
the
power
under
california
law
to
execute
such
a
contract.
one,
because
it
discriminated
between
landowners
which
was
invalid
under
california
law
and
secondly
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
that
was
the
reference,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
pasadena
versus
stimson
and
the
california
constitution
that
was
cited
in
that
case
was
article
1,
section
11.
as
you
recall,
the
california
constitution
does
not
have
an
expressed
due
process
clause
in
it.
but
in
the
pasadena
versus
stimson
case,
the
court
well
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
excuse
me,
i
--
i
misstated
it.
that
you're
absolutely
correct.
it
does
not
have
equal
protection
in
those
words
but
in
the
pasadena
versus
stimson
case,
the
court
found
equal
protection
under
the
california
constitution
in
article
1,
section
11
which
provides
generally
that
the
laws
must
have
general
application.
it
is
further
our
position
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
one
of
these
contracting
agencies,
the
state
irrigation
district
under
state
law
does
not
have
the
power
to
execute
this
contract,
that
there
is
no
federal
question
in
that
issue
that
is
presented
to
this
court
because
we
do
not
see
and
we
do
not
agree
with
appellants
that
by
the
force
of
any
federal
law
that
a
state
agency
can
be
invested
with
the
power
that
is
denied
to
it
under
state
law.
we
do
not
see
how
this
court
could
read
validity
into
a
contract
between
a
state
agency
and
the
united
states
or
the
state
agency
and
any
other
person
if
under
state
law
that
agency
is
without
power
to
execute
the
contract.
now,
in
discussing
the
acreage
limitation
provisions
of
the
contract,
i
think
that
we
should
review
briefly
the
nature
and
extent
of
those
provisions
itself.
and
before
doing
that
i
want
to
state
to
you
that
it
is
not
our
contention
and
never
has
been
that
the
acreage
limitations
as
set
forth
in
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
are
invalid.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
provisions
of
this
contract
containing
the
acreage
limitation
provisions
with
an
irrigation
district
of
the
state
of
california
which
imposes
those
conditions
upon
a
landowner
against
his
will
are
invalid
and
unconstitutional
provisions
of
the
contract.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
provisions,
yes
mr.
justice
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
black
of
the
acreage
limitation
but
it
doesn't
go
back
to
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
there
are
many
instances
in
which
the
statute
could
be
applied
in
our
view
where
it
would
be
a
constitutional
application
of
it.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
i
say
that
the
contract
may
be
drawn
under
the
federal
statute
but
it's
on
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
i
think
this
that
our
point
is
that
if
you
arrived
here
at
a
federal
question
so
that
you
were
discussing
the
legality
of
the
acreage
limitations
as
applied
to
the
federal
constitution,
it
is
our
conclusion
that
the
application
of
those
limitations
in
a
contract
with
an
irrigation
district
which
has
the
power
of
assessment
over
its
landowners
constitutes
a
deprivation
of
property
even
under
the
federal
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
say
the
fourteenth
rather
than
the
fifth
because
it
is
the
state
agency,
the
irrigation
district,
that
is
in
fact
imposing
the
limitation
and
carrying
the
limitation
out
in
the
contract
rather
than
the
federal
government.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
i
say
that
the
contract
is
not
authorized
under
state
law
but
if
you
get
over
that
hurdle
and
then
look
at
the
federal
side
of
the
picture
from
the
federal
constitution
that
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clause
as
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
strike
these
provisions
of
the
contract
out.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
well,
we
would
attack
the
validity
of
the
statute
which
applies
the
acreage
limitation
to
an
irrigation
district
in
a
contract.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
yes
that
--
that
statute
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
i
say
that
in
certain
instances
that
it
would
be
valid
and
as
your
question
is
so
framed,
i
would
not
claim
that
the
power
is
valid
if
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
the
secretary
were
operating
for
example
on
federal
lands
with
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
yes.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
well,
that
is
getting
back
to
our
jurisdictional
point
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
rather
than
our
constitutional
point.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
as
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
that's
jurisdictional
and
it's
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
state
constitution
also.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
that
is
correct.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
yes,
that
is
one
of
them.
then
if
we
hurdle
that
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
mr.
justice,
if
we
hurdle
that
and
get
over
to
the
federal
constitutional
question
then
i
still
think
that
the
application
of
the
conditions
in
a
contract
with
a
district
is
unconstitutional
and
let
me
point
out
why.
the
appellants
in
their
argument
here
contend
that
these
acreage
limitations
do
not
affect
the
property
rights
of
landowners.
that
is
found
in
their
reply
brief
at
page
52.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
unless
there
is
some
remedy
by
congress.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
or
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
or
there
is
an
administrative
reconciliation
such
was
done
in
the
case
of
the
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
imperial
irrigation
district.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
with
irrigation
districts,
yes
that
is
my
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
position.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
unless
--
unless
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
well,
i
think
that
there
is
an
entirely
different
proposition
mr.
justice
black
because
there
you
are
dealing
with
a
right
of
the
united
states
as
dealing
with
a
citizen
rather
than
a
right
of
the
united
states
in
dealing
with
an
agency
of
the
state
itself
which
is
created
by
statute
and
which
only
has
certain
statutory
powers
that
are
endowed
to
it
by
the
state
which
created
it.
a
citizen
has
rights
to
deal
with
the
united
states
that
i
would
admit
might
not
to
be
able
to
be
affected
by
what
some
states
says
if
that
citizen
can
deal
with
the
united
states.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
true
with
a
state
created
agency
such
an
irrigation
district.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
well,
i
think
that
--
that
if
some
provision
of
state
law
did
prohibit
that
that
california
would
have
the
power
to
do
that,
yes.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
i
don't
want
to
get
over
into
the
case
as
following
this
one
but
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
where
i
think
that
point
is
involved
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
well,
perhaps
i'm
mistaken.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
as
to
if
water
over
of
which
if
we
were
get
into
an
argument
as
to
who
has
the
control
of
the
use
and
disposition
of
the
water,
the
federal
government
or
the
state,
if
we
were
to
approach
it
from
that
issue,
i
would
say
yes,
that
california
could
do
that,
regardless
of
what
the
united
states
wants
to
do,
except
as
to
the
navigational
servitude
where,
of
course,
the
united
states'
power
is
supreme.
but
as
to
the
intrastate
water
which
i
think
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
had
recognized
is,
if
not
the
property
of
the
state
itself,
at
least,
they're
subject
to
the
control
and
disposition
by
the
state
subject
to
the
navigational
servitude.
and
so,
in
answering
your
question,
yes,
they
could
so
limit
the
use
of
the
water
as
they
saw
fit
subject,
of
course,
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
on
its
due
process
powers.
but
what
are
these
limitations
that
we're
talking
about?
one
of
the
points
that
has
been
stated
by
appellants
here
is
that
the
limitation
is
merely
a
restriction
as
to
the
use
of
water.
such
is
not
the
case.
the
contract
provides
that
every
excess
landowner
shall
not
sell
any
of
his
excess
land
except
at
a
price
that
is
approved
by
the
secretary
of
interior
and
failing
to
do
that,
failing
to
get
that
approval
that
the
land
is
then
forever
barred
from
receiving
project
water.
now,
this
provision
of
the
contract,
which
is
contained,
expressly
entered,
and
in
the
letter
that
we
set
out
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief
has
not
been
discussed
either
in
oral
argument
or
in
the
briefs
by
appellants
here.
now
what
--
what
gentlemen,
does
this
mean?
take
for
example
phil
albonico,
a
man
who
through
his
efforts
and
his
work
starting
out
as
a
sheepherder,
a
basque
sheepherder
as
a
boy
and
coming
over
to
this
country
when
he
was
12
years
old,
getting
the
band
of
sheep
eventually
selling
them
and
starting
to
farm
and
building
his
farm
up
to
1280
acres.
during
the
period
that
he
was
doing
this,
within
the
boundaries
of
the
madera
irrigation
district,
his
entire
lands,
all
of
them
were
assessed.
and
with
the
assessments
that
were
gained
from
his
and
other
lands,
the
madera
irrigation
district
developed
the
earliest
priority
of
waters
on
the
san
joaquin
river
upon
which
the
government
is
relying
and
distributing
these
waters
in
the
central
valley
project
and
litigated
those
rights
with
miller
&
lux
for
years
and
years.
this
man
finally
is
faced
with
a
contract
that
is
entered
into
by
the
united
states
in
the
district.
in
1951,
after
some,
what
--
31
years
of
assessment
that
says,
now
your
excess
land
not
only
cannot
receive
water
but
you
can't
sell
any
of
your
excess
land
except
at
a
price
that
is
fixed
by
the
secretary
of
interior
of
the
united
states.
and
if
you
do
so
sell
it,
the
land
will
be
forever
barred
from
receiving
project
water.
well,
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
limitation
upon
sale
of
land
in
an
irrigation
district,
is
not
a
recognition
of
the
economic
facts
of
life.
no
purchaser
will
purchase
land
in
an
irrigation
district
that
is
subject
to
assessment
but
is
forever
barred
from
receiving
water,
the
sole
supply
of
which
comes
from
the
federal
government
through
the
irrigation
district
in
the
central
valley
project.
and
so
we
say
that
here
is
a
property
right
of
mr.
albonico,
is
the
right
to
sell
his
land
at
such
price
as
he
could
receive,
that
is
taken
away
from
him,
by
this
contract
because
now
he
has
imposed
upon
that
price
the
will
and
the
--
and
the
determination
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
now,
what
form
can
he
turn
to?
what
administrative
remedy
does
he
have
or
what
judicial
remedy
does
he
have
if
the
secretary
of
interior
fixes
that
price
at
a
price
that
doesn't
suit
mr.
albonico?
he
has
none.
the
question
of
his
supply
of
water
under
state
law,
he
is
entitled
to
distribution,
readably
by
the
district
in
accordance
with
the
amount
of
his
assessment
to
his
proportionate
share
of
the
water
of
that
irrigation
district.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
no
on
--
on
the
basis
of
his
assessment.
as
his
assessment
bears
to
the
total
assessment
of
the
district,
he
is
entitled
to
that
portion
of
the
district
water.
if
his
assessment
were
a
dollar
and
the
district
were
$100,
he
would
be
entitled
one
one-hundredths
of
the
water.
now
under
state
law,
if
he
does
not
use
that
water
within
his
district,
he
is
entitled
to
assign
it
to
someone
else
in
the
district
so
that
they
can
use
it.
but
now
under
this
contract,
his
excess
lands
--
his
lands
over
160
acres
are
suddenly
deprived
of
this
right
to
receive
their
proportionate
share
of
the
waters
of
the
state.
now,
it
has
been
said
by
appellants,
well
he
might
receive
some
indirect
benefit
for
his
excess
land
such
as
the
underground
water
supply.
that
very
issue
was
raised
in
the
albonico
case
and
the
trial
court
in
that
case
found
that
there
was
absolutely
no
benefit
that
the
land
would
receive
as
a
factual
matter
unless
it
received
its
water
supply
for
all
of
its
lands.
and
said
to
the
district,
either
enter
into
some
kind
of
a
contract
where
you
can
give
this
man
his
proportionate
share
of
the
water
or
exclude
him
from
the
boundaries
of
the
district.
now
again,
i
ask
what
form
do
we
go
to,
to
recompense
mr.
albonico
or
any
landowner
in
a
district,
whether
he
now
be
excess
or
non-excess,
he
may
be
excess
tomorrow
if
he's
a
husband
and
wife
and
his
wife
dies
and
he
inherits
the
other
half
of
the
property,
he
immediately
then
becomes
one
of
the
suspect
class.
where
do
we
turn
to
recompense
him?
what
form
do
we
go
to,
to
reimburse
him
for
these
property
rights
that
have
been
taken?
the
appellants
say,
he
can
sue
the
united
states
and
he
can
recover
damage
if
he
has
sustained
any
and
therefore,
there
is
no
constitutional
deprivation
of
property.
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
rockwell,
in
the
first
instance,
this
validation
proceeding
could
well
act
as
any
bar
to
a
further
proceeding
for
compensation
because
the
contract
which
imposed
and
which
took
his
rights
away,
if
validated,
would
settle
for
once
and
for
all,
whether
he
had
any
litigable
rights.
his
day
in
court
is
on
the
validation
of
this
contract.
his
day
in
court
is
to
say
this
contract
deprives
me
of
rights
and
it
is
illegal
for
you
to
execute
such
a
contract.
we
don't
contend
or
we
don't
admit
that
he
is
required
to
stand
back
and
say,
”this
contract
takes
these
rights
away
from
me
but
my
only
remedy
is
one,
to
sue
the
united
states
or
the
district
or
whoever
for
damages
for
my
deprivation.”
as
mr.
rockwell
pointed
out,
that
would
turn
inverse
condemnation
into
a
universal
duel
that
would
completely
wipe
out
the
due
process
clause
of
the
state
or
any
federal
constitution
because
it
would
be
a
complete
answer
to
say
we
held
the
--
in
the
case
of
the
federal
government,
we
have
the
constitutional
power
to
take
this
right.
therefore,
all
you
have
to
do
is
sue
us
for
the
damage
without
the
united
states
going
through
the
procedure
of
getting
the
congressional
authority
and
to
act
--
to
take
this
right
by
a
condemnation
procedure.
and
so
we
feel,
gentlemen,
that
this
is
the
form
that
these
people
who
are
excess
landowners
or
who
may
become
excess
landowners
must
turn
to
in
order
to
have
their
rights
protected.
it
is
this
very
case,
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
contract
as
to
these
landowners
is
valid
or
invalid.
it
is
this
form
that
he
must
come
to
and
at
this
time
in
order
to
receive
his
protection.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
well
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
i
think
that
their
contention,
both
the
government
and
the
appellants
is
that
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
acquire
the
unlimited
title
as
they
are
talking
about
to
the
waters
of
the
state
of
california
so
that
they
can
impose
any
condition
that
they
see
fit.
i
do
think
that
that
is
their
position.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
regardless
of
whether
the
united
states
has
that
power
which
we
do
not
concede,
that
they
must
exercise
that
power
in
a
constitutional
manner.
if
they
are
going
to
do
that,
they
must
then
file
their
condemnation
action,
not
just
go
in
and
take,
that
we
have
the
right
if
they
go
in
and
take
by
terms
of
this
contract
to
say
the
contract
is
illegal.
you
cannot
execute
it.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
well
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
yes.
that
--
that
is
what
they
say.
we
say
that
we
have
two
remedies
--
mr.
denslow
b.
green
--
if
--
if
there
is
a
taking.
mr.
denslow
b.
green
yes.
now,
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
answer
to
mr.
davis'
contention
and
getting
back
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
as
you
recall
in
referring
to
the
albonico
case,
mr.
davis
said
that
what
the
court
there
held
was
--
that
mr.
albonico
was
entitled
to
water.
no
such
holding
was
made.
there
was
no
holding
in
that
case
that
mr.
albonico
could
enforce
the
bureau
of
reclamation
to
deliver
water
to
him.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
183
of
the
appendices
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
this
is
what
the
court
said
there
and
i
think
it's
important
because
it
indicates
how
strongly
the
talk
is
that
the
court
is
talking
about
the
power
of
a
district
to
act
rather
than
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
act.
it
says
that
in
view
on
our
decisions
in
ivanhoe
and
madera
wherein
it
was
held
that
the
excess
land
provisions
in
similar
contracts
were
improperly
included
therein.
it
must
be
concluded
in
this
proceeding
that
the
district,
not
the
united
states,
the
district
may
not
impose
on
landowners
within
the
district,
the
limitations
contained
in
sections
28,
29
and
30
of
the
contracting
question
and
that
all
of
the
petitioners'
lands
within
the
district,
they're
entitled
to
their
fair
rateable
portion
of
water
distributed
and
to
be
distributed
by
the
district
for
irrigation
purposes.
the
court
then
goes
on
to
say
that
if
the
district
can
enter
into
a
proper
contract
that
he
will
be
entitled
to
his
rateable
portion
of
water,
and
consequently,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
district
does
not
impose
these
limitations
on
him,
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
be
excluded
from
the
district
because
there
is
hope
that
in
the
future
that
the
question
will
be
solved.
now,
in
conclusion
then,
in
restating
our
position,
we
feel
that
what
the
court
below
was
dealing
with
was
the
rights
of
an
irrigation
district
to
contract.
that
it
held
that
those
rights
were
not
such
that
the
district
by
a
contract
with
the
united
states
or
any
other
person
could
discriminate
among
the
landowners
of
the
district
on
the
amount
of
land
that
they
held.
we
hold
that
the
court
below
determined
that
a
contract
which
prohibited
the
vesting
of
a
valid,
permanent
or
pertinent
right
to
water
in
the
district
for
the
benefit
of
the
landowner,
was
contrary
to
state
law
and
that
the
district
could
not
so
execute
a
contract.
now,
we
are
then
presented
with
this
question.
you
say
to
us
there
is
a
hiatus
here.
the
federal
government
cannot
act.
may
we
point
out
to
you
that
in
1956
by
amending
the
acts
of
congress
that
the
united
states
has
already
provided
that
the
contracts
could
be
amended
to
include
a
permanent
water
right
and
could
--
already
has
provided
that
the
contracts
could
be
amended
to
provide
for
credit
for
repayment.
so,
two
of
the
three
questions
are
now
out
of
the
way
and
the
only
thing
that
remains
is
the
question
of
action
by
congress
or
the
state
so
that
an
irrigation
district
can
execute
such
a
contract
as
is
now
before
this
court.
