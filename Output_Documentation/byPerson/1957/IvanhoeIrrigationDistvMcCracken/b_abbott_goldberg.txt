mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
may
it
please
the
court.
these
four
cases
are
four
appeals
taken
from
the
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court,
wherein
that
court
by
4-to-3
decisions
held
invalid
certain
statutes
of
the
united
states.
those
statutes
are
section
46
of
the
omnibus
adjustment
act
of
1926
which
incorporates
the
so-called
acreage
limitation.
section
9
(c)
and
9
(e)
of
the
reclamation
project
act
of
1939
which
provides
a
mode
for
contracting
between
the
unites
states
and
water
users
agencies
in
california.
presented
along
with
the
appealable
questions
there
are
also
reviewable
questions
not
in
themselves
appealable.
those
reviewable
questions
are
the
interpretation
of
section
46,
section
9
(c)
and
section
9
(e),
the
interpretation
of
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
whereby
federal
law
refers
to
state
law,
and
the
interpretation
of
california
water
code
section
23200.
and
the
similar
provision
in
section
6
of
the
santa
barbara
county
water
agency
act,
whereby,
state
law
refers
to
federal
law
and
states
that
state
agencies
may
cooperate
with
the
united
states
under
the
reclamation
act.
the
ivanhoe
case
is
the
leading
case.
the
other
three
cases
are
based
upon
it
expressly
by
the
california
court.
and
in
my
argument,
i
will
be
generally
referring
to
the
ivanhoe
case
except
from
time
to
time
as
we
refer
to
summaries
in
the
madera
case
or
in
the
other
three
cases
which
illuminate
and
explain
the
ivanhoe
case.
the
cases
arise
out
of
two
reclamation
projects.
the
three
cases
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not.
the
cases
arise
out
of
two
reclamation
projects.
three
of
them
arise
out
of
the
central
valley
project
in
the
great
central
valley
of
california.
the
santa
barbara
case
arises
out
of
the
cachuma
project
which
delivers
water
to
the
coastal
regions
of
santa
barbara
county
in
southern
california.
the
purpose
of
both
projects,
of
course,
is
to
make
water
available
when
and
where
needed
to
support
existing
irrigated
and
municipal
economies.
the
central
valley
project
is
extremely
complex
in
its
physical
outline,
but
it
has
already
been
before
this
court
once
and
it
has
been
very
graphically
described
by
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
gerlach
case.
he
summarizes
it
as
a
gigantic
undertaking
to
redistribute
the
principal
freshwater
resources
of
the
state
of
california.
in
essence,
it
is
a
plan,
a
system
of
works,
whereby
water
is
made
available
from
the
sacramento
river
in
the
north
to
--
which
is
sacramento
region
be
relatively,
i
say
relatively,
well-watered.
it
is
not
well-watered
in
fact.
it
is
relatively
well-watered
to
the
much
more
arid
region
in
the
south,
the
san
joaquin
river.
it
is
done
by
an
exchange.
the
water
of
the
san
--
sacramento
river
is
taken
through
the
delta-mendota
canal
from
a
point
near
san
francisco
bay,
taken
south
through
a
giant
manmade
river,
the
delta-mendota
canal,
some
120
miles
and
put
into
the
san
joaquin
river.
the
san
joaquin
river
water
which
is
thereby
freed
from
the
burden
of
rights
which
had
here
before
attached
to
it
is
in
turn
diverted
north
and
south
at
friant.
it's
diverted
south
through
the
friant-kern
canal
which
is
another
manmade
river
extending
153
miles
south
from
friant
almost
to
bakersfield
and
extending
north
to
the
region
around
madera.
the
government
in
the
gigantic
nature
of
this
project
can
appear
from
the
government's
investment
in
it.
the
event
--
the
investment
for
the
presently
authorized
features
is
estimated
to
come
to
about
$800
million
and
already
expended
are
about
$400
million.
of
the
amounts
that
the
government
has
invested,
the
irrigators
will
repay
only
about
$60
million
and
they
will
repay
this
$60
million
without
interest
over
a
period
of
at
least
40
years.
the
cachuma
project
has
not
yet
had
the
benefit
of
a
judicial
description.
i
believe
this
is
the
first
time
the
cachuma
project
has
been
in
a
federal
court.
compared
to
the
central
valley
project
it
is
a
relatively
small
project.
it
is
a
transmountain
diversion
whereby,
the
waters
of
the
santa
ynez
river,
a
small
stream
in
the
coastal
range
in
santa
barbara
county,
the
waters
of
that
river
is
stored
in
dams,
diverted
through
a
tunnel,
the
tecolote
tunnel
and
brought
into
the
coastal
region
near
the
city
of
santa
barbara
to
irrigate
the
very
fertile
lands
of
that
coastal
region
and
to
supply
municipal
water
to
the
city
of
santa
barbara
and
to
some
of
the
surrounding
areas.
when
i
say
it's
relatively
small,
i
don't
mean
it's
a
small
project.
it's
small
relative
to
the
central
valley
project.
the
cachuma
project
only
involves
about
$50
million.
of
these
$50
million,
the
irrigators
will
repay
in
the
neighborhood
of
$16
million
and
will
also
pay
for
their
distribution
systems.
these
payments
also
will
be
without
interest.
now,
the
reason
for
united
states'
participation
in
these
projects
is
financial.
the
cheap
readily
accessible
water
in
california
has
been
exhausted
for
many
years.
the
cheap
water,
the
water
that's
easy
to
get
at
was
developed
by
the
early
irrigators,
beginning
in
the
period
about
the
1870s
and
going
through
the
turn
of
this
century.
and
now,
water
even
in
the
relatively
limited
quantities,
needed
in
a
project
like
cachuma,
now
water
can
be
made
available
in
california
only
at
great
expense
and
far
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
of
the
individuals
involved
and
of
any
of
the
local
areas
involved
to
finance.
so
far,
although,
state
participation
of
these
things
has
been
hoped
for,
so
far
only
the
united
states
has
demonstrated
the
financial
capacity.
one,
to
undertake
these
projects,
and
two,
to
offer
terms
to
the
water
users
that
are
within
their
ability
to
bear.
important
in
this
case
is
the
subsidy
to
irrigators
and
it's
obvious
that
this
subsidy
is
very
large.
as
chief
justice
gibson
points
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
ivanhoe
case,
the
irrigators
pay
less
than
one-fifth
of
the
cost
assigned
to
irrigation.
but
since
the
portion
that
they
pay
is
paid
without
interest,
the
subsidy
in
fact
is
even
greater
because
the
longer
the
payment
period
and
the
higher
the
rate
of
interest
that
is
used
to
compute
the
subsidy,
the
greater
will
be
the
subsidy
in
fact.
now,
it's
extremely
difficult
to
say
just
what
fraction
the
irrigators
are
paying,
but
it
seems
to
be
some
place
between
a
tenth
and
a
twelfth.
and
i
mention
this
not
as
truly
indicative
but
is
illustrative
of
the
fact
that
the
subsidy
is
very,
very
large.
tied
to
this
subsidy
is
the
problem
which
we
believe
is
the
central
problem
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
problem
of
the
acreage
limitation.
the
acreage
limitation
in
essence
is
this,
no
lands
in
excess
of
160
acres
in
one
ownership
are
entitled
to
receive
project
water
through
project
works,
unless
the
owners
of
those
excess
lands
agree
to
sell
the
lands
at
a
non-speculative
price.
and
a
device
is
provided,
permitted
by
the
statute
and
provided
in
the
contracts
for
the
assessment
of
these
land's
determination
of
prices
and
a
mode
of
disposition.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
acreage
limitation,
of
course,
is
to
ensure
a
widespread
distribution
of
this
very
large
subsidy
which
is
being
offered
by
the
government
to
the
irrigators.
in
--
in
essence,
it's
simply
this,
the
acreage
limitation
exists
so
that
a
person
won't
be
subsidized
more
just
because
he
happens
to
own
more.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
the
acreage
limitation,
sir
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
who
are
irrigators?
irrigators
as
distinguished
from
municipal
uses
are
these,
irrigators
are
farmers,
people
who
put
water
on
the
land
to
grow
crops.
there
is
no
acreage
limitation
applicable
to
municipal
users,
but
i
doubt
that
the
--
the
users
of
cachuma
project,
i
doubt
if
there's
anybody
in
this
country
wealthy
enough
to
own
a
160
acres
in
the
city
of
santa
barbara
in
municipal
area
or
anyway,
so
that
question
has
never
come
up.
the
limitation
applies
to
water
for
irrigation.
the
acreage
limitation
does
not
mean
that
the
excess
owner
must
sell
his
land.
the
excess
owner
can
keep
his
land
and
irrigate
it
with
whatever
sources
of
irrigation
he
has
used
in
the
past.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
your
honor.
it
means
a
great
deal
as
a
practical
matter.
as
a
practical
matter,
irrigation
was
going
on
in
these
areas
long
before.
i
was
speaking
of
the
central
valley
project
just
for
the
sake
of
clarity.
irrigation
was
going
on
in
these
areas
long
before
the
central
valley
project
is
constructed.
irrigation
was
going
on,
on
the
basis
of
ground
water.
of
course,
it's
not
physically
correct
to
--
to
say
this
but
this
provides
a
helpful
analogy,
i
think.
you
can
think
--
you
can
think
of
these
vast
alluvial
areas
in
california
such
as
the
central
valley
as
a
sort
of
an
underground
lake
and
water
was
pumped
out
of
that
underground
lake
and
used
for
irrigation
from
the
time
when
cheap
company
devices
and
cheap
power
became
available.
that
is
beginning,
a
period
about
1910
and
growing
in
intensity
through
the
1920s.
that
ground
water
was
rather
speedily
exhausted.
by
the
middle
of
1920s
this
underground
lake
had
either
been
drawn
dry
in
some
parts
or
the
levels
had
been
reduced
to
the
point
where
it
was
no
longer
economical
to
pump.
so,
the
central
valley
project
came
in
being
not
merely
to
supply
water
on
the
surface,
turn
it
out
of
canals
under
the
farmer's
land,
but
also
to
replenish
the
underground
because
fortunately,
this
underground
lake
is
in
many
areas
replenishable.
and
the
central
valley
project
is
a
device
in
part
to
use
this
vast
underground
reservoir,
use
it
to
its
best
advantage
which
leads
to
another
point,
your
honor.
and
that
is
although
we
say
the
acreage
limitation
means
that
a
excess
land
on
it
cannot
get
water
for
his
excess
lands
through
the
distribution
systems,
through
the
project
works.
in
point
of
fact,
if
you
have
areas
where
excess
--
where
water
is
being
applied
to
the
surface,
imported
and
the
applied
to
the
surface,
that
water
will
move,
it
will
percolate,
it
will
replenish
the
ground
water
in
the
physical
area
involved,
not
in
the
immediate
area
in
which
it
is
applied.
so
that
you
do
have
a
very
real
possibility
that
the
excess
owners
do
get
water
from
the
project,
although,
they
don't
get
it
through
the
project's
distribution
systems.
and
finally,
if
i
haven't
made
this
clear,
the
excess
owner
can
get
water
for
160
acres
of
his
land
just
the
same
as
anybody
else.
this
limitation
applies
only
to
the
so-called
excess
land.
it
also
applies
only
to
160
acres
in
one
ownership
and
due
to
an
administrative
interpretation
of
the
california
community
property
laws,
it
has
been
held
that
a
marital
community
can
own
320
acres,
husband
and
wife,
so
that
in
many
instances
we
should
be
talking
about
320
acre
limitation
rather
than
160.
and
perhaps
this
is
not
necessary
but
i
will
say
this,
a
160
acres
is
not
a
small
piece
of
land.
it's
a
mile
long
and
a
quarter
of
mile
wide,
and
it's
a
--
i
would
hate
to
have
to
plow
it
on
a
hot
day.
the
acreage
limitation
is
the
central
project,
is
the
central
problem
in
this
case
and
it
comes
up
in
the
guise,
can
the
california
irrigation
districts
apply
the
acreage
limitation?
phrased
in
the
terms
of
mr.
justice
shank's
opinion,
the
question
is,
can
the
united
states
acquire
the
sort
of
water
rights,
the
sort
of
title
to
water
which
the
california
court
believes
is
necessary
for
the
imposition
of
the
acreage
limitation?
and
our
problem
at
the
outset
and
particularly
under
this
court's
reservation
of
the
problem
with
jurisdiction,
our
problem
at
the
outset
is,
is
this
a
federal
question
merely
going
to
the
capacity
of
california
irrigation
districts
or
is
it
a
federal
question
going
to
the
capacity
of
the
united
sates?
we
submit
that
it
is
the
latter
and
that
it
is
only
the
latter.
to
--
to
see
that
it
is
only
a
federal
question,
unfortunately,
we
have
to
go
through
a
rather
dreary
exegesis
of
the
california
court's
opinion.
the
california
court
starts
out
with
the
proposition,
they
say
this
question
of
the
application
of
the
acreage
limitation
cannot
be
answered
without
reference
to
the
title
to
the
waters
involved.
and
they
say
the
power
to
control
these
waters
depends
upon
the
sort
of
title
that
the
united
states
can
acquire.
and
although
we
talk
about
title
in
these
cases,
we're
really
talking
about
the
power
to
control.
california
court
discusses
the
acquisition
of
rights
by
the
united
states.
the
united
states
has
acquired
a
vast
variety
of
water
rights
in
the
central
valley
project.
they've
acquired
rights
by
outright
purchase.
they
have
acquired
rights
by
exchange,
that
is
exchanging
the
sacramento
water
for
the
san
joaquin
water.
they
have
acquired
rights
by
appropriation
or
applications
to
appropriate
on
their
own
behalf.
they
have
acquired
rights
by
the
assignment
of
state
applications
to
appropriate
made
in
contemplation
of
the
project.
and
finally,
as
pointed
out
in
the
gerlach
case,
they
have
acquired
rights
by
the
process
of
eminent
domain.
and
the
california
courts
says,
all
these
rights
are
nevertheless
insufficient
to
enable
the
united
states
to
apply
the
acreage
limitation
because
the
--
these
rights
are
tainted.
they
are
--
they
are
subject
to
a
trust.
they
--
the
trust
exists
to
provide
everybody
in
the
state
of
california
with
an
aliquot
share
of
this
water
and
the
united
states
is
bound
by
this
trust,
which
adheres
to
the
water
rights
that
is
acquired,
bound
by
this
trust
to
deliver
water
to
everybody,
regardless
of
the
limitations
and
conditions
placed
on
the
conduct
of
the
united
states
by
the
applicable
federal
statutes.
and
how
do
they
come
to
this
conclusion?
well,
they
say
the
united
states
cannot
acquire
the
rights
of
the
--
that
united
states
in
effect
cannot
extinguish
this
trust.
the
united
states
cannot
acquire
an
unlimited
title
.why
can't
the
united
states
acquire
an
unlimited
title?
because
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
states
that
state
water
law
shall
be
respected
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
conduct
of
reclamation
projects.
now,
i
do
not
wish
to
discuss
it
at
this
moment
the
merits
of
that
contention.
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
is
a
federal
question.
and
that
the
case
turns
on
this
federal
question,
i
believe
can
be
demonstrated
by
indirection.
consider
what
the
california
court
says
about
the
situation
that
would
exist
if
the
united
states
could
acquire
an
unlimited
title.
suppose
the
united
states
could
acquire
an
unlimited
title,
would
the
result
of
the
case
be
the
same?
the
answer
is
no.
california
court
in
its
expressed
language
says
that
this
question
of
limited
title
comes
up
only
because
the
united
states
cannot
get
a
fee
simple
title.
and
then
they
say,
consider
the
analogy
of
public
lands.
now,
you'll
recall
that
historically
in
the
distribution
of
public
lands
under
the
homestead
acts,
there
was
a
similar
or
similar
limitations.
the
patent
would
be
issued
only
for
160
acres,
some
cases
320.
and
the
california
court
discusses
this
situation
and
says,
of
course,
the
united
states
could
do
that
with
regard
to
the
public
lands
because
it
owned
the
public
lands,
it
had
all
the
rights
of
proprietorship.
so
presumably,
if
the
united
states
could
acquire
the
water
rights
involved
here,
it
too
would
have
all
the
rights
of
proprietorship
with
regard
to
the
water
and
could
be
distributed
subject
to
the
limitations
which
congress
sees
fit
to
impose.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
would
say,
yes,
but
that
is
a
construction
of
the
opinion.
i
don't
recall
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
--
i
would
answer
the
question,
yes,
but
that
is
my
construction
of
the
opinion.
i
don't
call
--
recall
that
the
california
court
discusses
it
expressly
in
those
terms.
certainly
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
they
lump
all
the
united
states
rights
together
and
they
say
that
all
the
united
states
rights
are
subject
to
this
trust.
i
will
try
to
find
their
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
thank
you.
the
--
the
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
make
clear
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
they
treat
the
united
states'
rights
from
whatever
source
acquired
as
being
subject
through
the
trust.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
well,
it's
actually
both.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
the
--
the
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
the
united
--
the
united
states
can't
have
--
can't
get
rid
of
the
trust
because
section
8
requires
it
to
observe
state
law.
now,
the
appellees
argue
that
this
case
--
the
description
i've
given
of
this
case,
of
course,
is
not
correct.
and
that
the
--
in
fact,
the
opinion
does
not
depend
upon
the
construction
of
the
powers
of
the
united
states,
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
acquire
what
it
needs
and
to
use
it
in
accordance
with
federal
law.
they
say
that
this
case
concerns
merely
the
power
of
california
irrigation
districts
to
enter
into
this
kind
of
contract.
now,
of
their
argument,
i
must
say
this,
that
their
argument
is
an
interpretative
argument.
it
is
not
a
descriptive
one.
i
have
tried
in
my
argument
to
paraphrase
the
language
of
the
california
court.
the
appellees
on
the
other
hand,
i
believe
are
arguing
their
own
private
conceptions
of
what
must
have
been
in
the
mind
of
the
california
court
when
it
reached
its
conclusion.
for
example,
the
appellees
described
the
so-called
debtor-creditor
relationship,
which
the
united
states
says
--
excuse
me,
which
the
california
court
says
exist
between
the
united
states
and
the
districts.
and
they
say
of
this
debtor-creditor
relationship
that
of
necessity,
that
is
their
language,
of
necessity
the
california
court
was
looking
at
state
law.
well,
the
california
court
apparently
felt
no
such
necessity
because
this
language
it
says
in
considering
the
debtor-creditor
relationship,
we
are
considering,
“applicable
federal
law.”
they
did
not
refer
to
state
law
and
for
good
reason,
there
is
no
state
law
that
is
particularly
applicable
to
the
situation
they
were
describing.
a
second
example,
in
evaluating
the
acreage
limitation,
the
appellees
say
of
the
california
--
say
the
california
court
held
that
the
acreage
limitation
would
collide
with
california
constitution,
article
i,
section
11.
california
constitution,
article
i,
section
11
is
a
section
which
simply
says
that
all
uniform
laws
must
have
a
general
operation.
the
only
problem
with
the
appellees
argument
is
that
the
california
court
never
mentioned
article
i,
section
11
if
there
is
a
reference
to
article
i,
section
11
and
we
have
been
diligent
trying
to
find
it.
we
have
not
found
it
in
the
court's
opinion.
instead,
the
california
court
talks
in
terms
of
the
acreage
limitation
as
denying
equal
protection.
well,
we
believe
that
this
very
significantly
indicates
reliance
on
a
federal
ground
because
there
is
no
equal
protection
clause
in
the
california
constitution
and
it
would
seem,
under
those
circumstances,
when
the
california
court
is
talking
about
equal
protection,
it
must
be
speaking
in
federal
terms
because
that's
the
only
constitution
where
the
language
exists.
similarly,
the
appellees
have
a
reference
to
california
water
code
section
22252,
which
is
a
section
providing
for
the
distribution
of
water
by
paying
tolls.
the
distribution
of
water
by
irrigation
districts
by
paying
tolls
and
says
that
the
water
must
be
distributed
equitably
among
those
users
offering
to
pay
the
toll.
well
again,
this
is
not
a
section
upon
which
the
california
court
relied.
it's
something
that
has
been
read
in
by
the
appellees
in
their
interpretation
of
the
court's
opinion.
finally,
the
appellees
lay
considerable
stress
upon
california
constitution,
article
i,
section
13
which
contains
the
california
version
of
the
due
process
clause.
and
they
seek
to
rely
on
the
rule
stated
in
lynch
against
new
york,
that
where
you
have
a
state
constitution
involved
and
a
federal
constitution,
the
two
being
the
same,
this
court
will
assume
that
the
question
is
based
on
the
state
constitution
rather
than
the
federal
one.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that's
right.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i'm
not
going
to
agree
with
your
qualification.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
well,
you're
--
you're
--
you're
very
much
abreast.
i
--
i'll
try
to
illustrate
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
--
the
last
point,
however,
about
the
capacity
of
the
irrigation
districts,
as
we
say
in
a
footnote
in
our
reply
brief,
we
--
we
are
so
certain
the
california
law
has
endowed
these
districts
with
all
the
capacity
that
they
need.
that
we
have
not
considered
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
they
didn't
have
capacity.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
now,
if
they
didn't
have
capacity,
quite
a
different
question
would
be
raised,
and
that
would
be
whether
the
federal
law
has
itself
endowed
them
with
capacity
whether
the
united
states
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
--
as
itself
taken
over
these
districts
as
instrumentalities
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
--
to
achieve
the
general
welfare.
the
--
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make,
however,
with
regard
to
the
reference
to
the
state
constitution
is
this,
that
one
--
one
of
the
references
that
the
appellees
make
is
absent.
the
one
that
is
present
is
not
controlling,
because
what
is
being
tested
here?
what's
being
tested
in
these
cases
is
a
federal
statute,
and
whether
that
federal
statute
is
being
tested
against
the
state
constitution
or
a
federal
constitution,
to
us,
seems
to
be
inevitably
a
federal
question
and
nothing
but
a
federal
question.
now,
i
--
i
don't
mean
you
stand
here
to
argue
that
a
federal
statute
can
be
tested
against
the
state
constitution.
i
--
i
have
looked
with
great
diligence
and
some
of
my
colleagues
for
a
case
where
this
has
happened
before,
and
we
have
found
only
one
that
is
the
ex
parte
western
national
bank
where
a
state
court
has
tested
a
federal
statute
against
the
state
constitution.
and
in
that
case
without
discussion
of
the
jurisdictional
problem,
this
court
assumed
jurisdiction.
i
believe
they
affirmed
the
case,
but
they
assumed
jurisdiction
and
--
and
considered
the
case
without
question.
now,
we
believe
that
we
should
discuss
in
interest
of
priority,
the
possible
language
--
the
language
in
the
california
court's
opinion
that
could
possibly
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
based
on
state
grounds.
there
are
at
least
three
such
passages,
the
appellees
mentioned
two,
but
we
believe
that
there's
a
common
answer
to
offer
that.
the
common
answer
is
this,
that
correctly
read,
you
will
find
that
all
of
these
statements
are
involved,
interwoven,
intermingled,
however
you
wish
to
use
it,
intertwined
with
the
decision
of
the
federal
question.
the
--
the
first
of
these
statements
is
with
reference
to
california
water
code,
section
22250
and
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
the
opinion
is
reprinted
at
pages
46
and
47.
and
the
california
court
says,
“the
duty
of
both
contracting
parties,”
and
if
the
court
please,
notice
that
language,
the
duty
of
both
the
contracting
parties,
both
the
united
states
and
the
district,
so
that
we
have
a
federal
question
as
to
the
united
states
right
there.
in
the
performance
of
their
obligation
is
set
forth
in
section
22250
of
the
water
code,
providing
for
apportionment
of
water
ratably
to
the
assessments
paid
by
the
landowner.
and
then
the
court
says
at
the
end
of
the
quotation,
“no
pertinent
exceptions
on
appeal.”
now,
the
california
court
was
well
aware
of
section
23200
of
the
california
water
code
which
it
discusses
a
little
further
on,
on
page
51.
and
--
and
section
23200
is,
i
believe,
worth
the
attention
of
this
court
because
it
shows
how
far
the
state
of
california
has
gone
in
trying
to
make
this
form
of
cooperation
possible.
section
23200
is
part
of
the
irrigation
district
law
--
excuse
me,
irrigation
district
federal
cooperation
law.
that
law
states
generally
that
the
districts
may
cooperate
with
the
united
states
under
the
reclamation
act
and
all
other
acts
of
congress
or
amendments
there
are
or
supplements
thereto
permitting
cooperation.
and
then
it
says
expressly,
“all
water,
the
right
to
be
used
of
which
is
acquired
by
a
district
under
any
contract
with
the
united
states,
shall
be
distributed
and
apportioned
by
the
district
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
acts
of
congress.”
so
how
--
in
my
little
quotation
on
page
46
and
47,
how
does
the
california
court
say
there
is
no
pertinent
exception?
it
says
2300
--
23200
does
not
apply
because
the
united
states
cannot
secure
an
unlimited
title.
so
we
have,
i
submit,
a
clear
case
of
the
interweaving
of
the
state
and
federal
question
if
in
fact
the
statement
with
regard
to
22250
is
a
state
question
in
the
first
place.
it
is
a
state
question
which
has
been
resolved
in
the
light
of
the
court's
determination
of
the
federal
question.
similarly,
a
reference
to
the
second
validating
act
of
1949
which
has
been
emphasized
by
the
appellees,
the
reference
appears
at
page
59
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
and
the
paragraph
ending
on
that
page,
the
last
sentence,
it
says,
“in
addition,
any
validating
act
could
not
have
confirmed
the
160-acre
limitation
for
the
obvious
reason
that
the
legislature
could
not
therefore
--
could
not
have
therefore
constitutionally
authorized
it.
or
obviously,
this
ties
to
the
holding
that
the
united
states
cannot
acquire
the
title
that
it
needs
because
if
these
water
users
have
a
trust
title
or
trust
right
of
some
sort
which
the
united
states
cannot
acquire,
it
denies
them
due
process
not
to
honor
that
title.
so
the
reference
to
the
constitution
appears
to
us
to
be
a
mere
reiteration
of
what
the
court
has
previously
said.
and
finally,
on
page
63
of
the
statement,
there
appears
a
recapitulation
by
the
california
court.
in
the
paragraph
number
5
of
the
court's
opinion
it
says,
in
delivering
water
to
the
opinion,
the
--
excuse
me,
in
delivering
water
to
the
district,
it
is
not
competent
for
the
united
states
or
the
district
either
or
both
to
discriminate
against
the
present
and
potential
water
users
on
the
basis
of
the
land
owned
by
them.
and
that
the
160-acre
limitation
contained
in
the
reclamation
act
is
inapplicable
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
contract
and
is
improperly
contained
therein.
and
i
submit
that
reading
the
opinion
as
a
whole,
the
reason
that
the
acreage
limitation
is
inapplicable
simply
refers
us
back
to
the
problem,
it
is
inapplicable
because
the
united
states
can't
acquire
sort
of
rights,
the
california
court
thinks
it's
necessary
to
make
it
applicable.
now,
and
perhaps
this
is
the
proof
in
the
pudding
with
regard
to
the
case
being
based
on
state
and
federal
grounds.
we
have
involved
here
the
santa
barbara
district.
santa
barbara
county
water
agency
is
not
an
irrigation
district.
and
it
must
be
clear,
if
i
have
not
made
it
so,
that
when
we
speak
of
irrigation
districts,
we
are
speaking
of
that
peculiar
form
of
place
like
municipal
or
public
corporation
known
as
an
irrigation
district
under
the
california
law,
organized
under
the
irrigation
district
act.
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
districts
in
california
having
irrigation
functions
that
are
not
known
as
irrigation
districts.
now,
the
santa
barbara
county
water
agency
and
the
county
water
districts
which
are
its
subcontractors
are
not
irrigation
district,
although,
they
serve
an
irrigation
function
but
within
the
artistic
sense
that
i
try
to
describe,
they
are
not
irrigation
districts.
the
limitations
of
section
22250
upon
which
so
much
reliance
is
placed
by
the
appellees,
do
not
apply
to
the
santa
barbara
county
water
agency
and
to
its
member
unit,
the
county
water
districts
or
the
city
of
santa
barbara.
there's
simply
no
such
requirement
in
the
california
statutes
referring
to
them.
yet,
the
california
court
has
decided
the
santa
barbara
case
on
the
basis
of
the
ivanhoe
case.
well,
since
there
is
no
common
state
ground,
it
would
follow
that
the
case
must
be
based
on
the
common
federal
ground
and
only
based
on
the
common
federal
ground.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i've
qualified
it
only
under
federal
ground,
your
honor,
because
we
have
tried
to
analyze
this
case
and
consider
what
possible
state
grounds
--
common
state
grounds
there
might
be
and
we
have
found
them.
but
i
--
i
do
agree
with
you
by
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
well,
we
take
--
we're
trying
to
take
the
cases
badly
against
this
as
we
can.
now,
with
regard
to
the
merits,
i'm
sorry
to
use
so
much
time
on
jurisdiction,
but
we're
again
trying
to
obey
the
admonishment
in
this
court's
rules
to
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
well,
the
relief
that
we
ask,
your
honor
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
is
reversal.
unfortunately
--
unfortunately,
even
if
we
succeed
in
obtaining
a
reversal
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
end
of
this
litigation.
there
has
been
at
least
in
the
ivanhoe
and
madera
cases,
there
has
been
a
state
ground
left
open.but
the
california
court
simply
hasn't
determined,
so
we
can't
say
with
any
assurance
what
will
happen
to
the
cases
if
they
are
reversed.
on
the
merits
and
--
and
i
will
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
question
left
open
concerns
notice
of
election.
these
districts
cannot
--
cannot
enter
into
contracts
of
this
sort
with
the
united
states
without
having
a
vote
of
their
electorates.
and
the
notices
of
election
were
attacked
as
being
defective
and
the
california
court
said
we
will
not
pass
on
this
attack
on
the
notices
of
election
because
we're
reversing
the
cases,
they're
going
to
have
to
go
back
to
new
contracts
anyhow
and
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
determine
that
question.
well,
if
this
court
in
turn
reverses,
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
california
court
to
determine
the
problem
of
the
election.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
the
--
these
are
special
proceedings.
i
--
it's
always
difficult
to
state
the
negative.
i'll
simply
say
i
know
of
no
counterpart
under
the
federal
practice
whereby
they
might
be
brought
the
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that's
a
possibility,
but
section
46
refers
to
proceedings
for
confirmation.
and
as
you
undoubtedly
know,
mr.
justice
douglas,
there
exists
in
the
west
rather
commonly
the
so-called
confirmation
proceedings.
these
proceedings
they
say
they're
in
rem,
these
proceedings
whereby
the
possible
objectors
to
district
activity
can
be
precluded
and
this
is
one
of
those
proceedings.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
--
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
thought
you
were
asking
me
about
the
--
really,
really
rather
strange
proceeding
whereby
these
cases
have
been
found.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes.
it's
something
that's
been
used
in
california
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
yes,
yes.
(inaudible)
describes
this
with
all
their
panoply.
he
describes
it
simply
as
a
form
of
declaratory
relief.
on
the
merits,
i
would
simply
like
to
say
this.
the
appellees
write
a
great
deal
about
coercing
the
state,
overwriting
state
law,
trying
to
assume
a
sort
of
foreboding
presence
of
the
united
states
in
the
state
of
california.
if
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear
in
these
cases
it
is
that
there
is
no
overwriting
of
state
law.
i've
already
read
section
23200.
i'll
refer
to
the
irrigation
district
federal
cooperation
law,
if
--
if
plain
words
have
any
meaning,
the
state
of
california
through
its
legislature
has
and
has
for
many
years
done
everything
it
could
to
make
these
contracts
possible.
furthermore,
with
all
the
talk
that
we
have
had
about
title
to
water,
we
must
say
that
we
don't,
for
one
moment,
believe
that
title
to
water
is
really
involved
in
these
cases.
what
is
involved
in
these
cases
is
the
use
of
federally
owned
facilities.
if
any
of
these
people
have
a
title
to
water,
they're
presumably
as
free
as
they
ever
were
to
go
and
get
that
water
from.
mr.
mccracken,
who
lives
some
hundred
miles
from
the
san
joaquin
river,
can
through
his
own
benefit
--
through
his
own
unaided
efforts
to
get
water
out
of
the
san
joaquin
river,
there's
nothing
in
this
contract
that
prevents
him
from
doing
so.
these
contracts
concern
only
the
limitations
imposed
on
federal
service
through
federally
owned
works.
finally,
the
appellees
argue,
well,
this
is
an
extension
of
the
general
welfare
power,
such
an
extension
that
it
will
destroy
the
limited
form
of
government
as
we
have
heretofore
known
it.
we
think
the
reply
to
that
is
rather
short.
the
limitation
on
the
general
welfare
power
is
a
limitation
that
it'd
be
exercised
for
the
welfare
of
the
nation.
and
certainly
it
would
be
paradoxical
to
say
that
the
general
welfare
power
may
be
exercised
for
the
welfare
of
the
nation,
but
it
must
be
exercised
subject
to
each
particular
local
control
as
you
happen
to
find
it
from
state
to
state.
on
the
acreage
limitation,
i'll
ask
a
simple
question
then
i'll
answer
it,
i
hope
i
answer
it.
if
the
acreage
limitation
is
causing
these
districts
so
much
trouble,
why
don't
you
simply
let
the
excess
landowners
out
of
the
districts?
why
not
get
rid
of
them?
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
you
cannot
allow
the
excess
landowners
out
of
the
districts
because
as
i
told
mr.
justice
brennan
earlier,
there
is
a
very
real
ground
water
benefit
in
these
areas.
there
is
a
direct
benefit
possible
to
the
excess
landowners.
i
say
possible
because
it
becomes
of
course
a
question
of
fact
as
to
each
parcel
whether
that
direct
benefit
exists.
and
two,
there
is
an
indirect
benefit.
the
california
court,
and
i
think
this
is
common
with
the
courts
of
the
nation
generally,
has
held
that
you
don't
need
a
direct
benefit
to
keep
lands
in
assessment
districts,
an
indirect
benefit
is
enough.
and
these
lands
get
all
the
indirect
benefits
with
the
exception
of
that
increment
of
value
which
is
due
to
getting
to
water
through
the
surface
distribution
system.
i
say,
i've
exhausted
most
of
my
time,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
or
whatever
remains
to
me
for
rebuttal.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
thank
you.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
may
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
heard
so
many
statements
to
which
i
take
violent
exception
that
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin.
but
the
--
the
first
is
this.
with
regard
to
mr.
green's
statement
of
the
albonico
case,
mr.
green
says
that
the
trial
court
found,
i'm
referring
to
the
--
to
the
record
now
at
page
412,
he
says
that
the
trial
court
found
that
the
albonicos
were
not
receiving
any
direct
benefit
from
the
operations
of
the
madera
irrigation
district,
direct
benefit
by
way
of
ground
water
replenishment.
if
the
trial
court
findings
are
examined,
you
will
see
that
the
trial
court
was
reviewing
the
action
of
the
district
board
of
directors.
in
california,
land
is
excluded
from
an
irrigation
district
by
asking
for
a
hearing
before
the
board
of
directors
of
the
district.
the
determinations
of
the
board
of
directors
are
subject
to
--
to
judicial
review.
the
board
of
directors
found
that
the
lands
would
be
benefited.
the
trial
court
held
that
that
planning
of
the
board
was
incorrect
and
there
was
a
very
serious
question
before
the
california
court
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
trial
court's
findings,
the
authority
of
the
trial
court
to
review
this
finding
of
the
board
and
the
proper
remedy
that
should
be
--
should
be
granted
if
the
board
of
directors
of
the
district
was
in
fact
incorrect.
so
we
still
have
open.
it
was
never
necessary
to
determine
under
the
california
court's
opinion
but
we
still
have
open
to
question
of,
are
the
albonicos
getting
the
benefit?
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
no,
i
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
you
asked
for
a
categorical
answer,
your
honor.
now,
i
--
i
will
give
it
to
you.
one,
we
have
not
considered
that
question
because
in
our
opinion,
if
--
if
plain
language
has
any
meaning,
california
law
has
given
these
districts
all
the
power
they
need.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
our
contention
is
that
california
law
authorizes
the
districts
to
enter
into
these
contracts
and
that
the
contracts
are
--
were
held
invalid
by
the
california
court,
not
for
any
lack
of
capacity
on
the
part
of
the
districts
but
because
the
united
states
could
not
get
the
sort
of
title
that
the
california
court
thought
it
needed.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
--
i
don't
like
to
quibble
with
mr.
rockwell.
he
--
he
says,
well,
it's
a
--
when
you
have
the
state
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
well,
your
--
your
honor,
he
--
he
makes
a
point
about
this
business
of
the
applicable
federal
law.
you
have
a
state
statute
where
it
says,
“you
can
contract
with
the
united
states
under
the
applicable
federal
law”
and
he
says
that
is
a
state
question
which
federal
law
is
applicable.
well,
i
--
i
can't
bring
myself
to
pass
the
hurdle.
how
you
can
say
the
decision
of
which
is
an
applicable
federal
law
is
a
state
question,
but
suppose
you
do.
let's
look
at
why
the
federal
law,
the
acreage
limitation,
is
not
applicable.
you
--
you
can't
just
decide
this
question
in
a
vacuum.
you
have
to
look
why?
it's
not
applicable,
says
the
california
court
because
under
section
8,
the
united
states
has
disabled
itself
from
acquiring
this
sort
of
title
that
it
needs.
now,
one
--
one
other
thing,
and
i'll
confine
myself
to
this.
mr.
rockwell
says,
"well,
if
section
8
means
what
we
claim
it
to
be,"
that
is,
that
the
united
states
can
give
the
sort
of
rights
that
it
needs
for
the
acreage
limitation,
"why
all
this
monkey
business,"
and
i'm
quoting,”
and
why
all
this
monkey
business
about
appropriations?”
now,
i
hate
to
take
this
court
down
the
rat
hole
of
water
--
of
water
along
the
west
because
it
is
extremely
confusing,
but
you
have
to
look
at
section
8
in
its
historical
context.
and
unfortunately,
the
legislative
history
on
section
8
is
not
particularly
revealing.
but
you
look
at
section
8
and
certain
things
do
become
clear.
one,
the
section
was
drafted
at
a
time
when
it
was
feared
that
the
united
states
through
the
ownership
of
public
lands
could
impose
on
the
states,
a
system
of
water
law
which
the
states
deemed
hostile
to
their
interests.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
use
by
way
of
illustration
the
winters
case,
we
haven't
cited
in
here.
it's
not
--
it's
not
really
germane
to
this
argument.
but
in
the
winters
case,
the
united
states
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
sort
of
riparian
right
for
an
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
montana
where
only
appropriative
rights
were
recognized.
and
if
that
situation
could
exist,
then
every
appropriative
right
on
a
stream
where
the
united
states
owned
land
might
be
in
jeopardy.
so
that's
one
reason
for
section
8.
another
reason
for
section
8
is
this.
you
will
notice
the
statement
in
the
section
8,
“beneficial
use
shall
be
the
measure
of
the
right.”
at
one
time
in
western
water
law,
strangely
enough,
beneficial
use
was
not
the
measure
of
the
right.
there
are
old
cases
indicating
that
the
size
of
your
ditch,
your
--
your
transportation
was
the
measure
of
the
right.
the
amount
you
could
divert,
not
the
amount
you
could
use
and
the
legislative
history
does
say
putting
this
language
in
the
measure
of
the
right
does
accord
with
what
seems
to
be
the
common
sense
that
you
should
--
that's
an
improvement
they
say
on
the
state
law.
finally,
there
is
a
third
reason,
and
this
perhaps
is
most
the
compelling
but
the
most
difficult
to
explain,
section
8
exists
as
a
device
to
protect
the
united
states.
you
--
you
read
cases
like
lux
against
haggin.
and
lux
against
haggin
states
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
there's
a
slight
confusion.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
lux
against
haggin
states
of
the
acts
of
1866,
1870,
1877,
the
desert
land
acts
whereby
the
united
states
recognized
the
appropriation
rights
says
these
acts
constituted
grants
to
unnamed
grantees.
that's
their
language.
actually
what
those
acts
did
is
give
to
everybody
in
the
world
or
everybody
capable
of
getting
access
to
a
stream,
gave
them
the
power
to
appropriate
under
state
law
so
that
if
the
united
states
itself
in
an
appropriation
state
does
not
also
make
an
appropriation,
it
leaves
itself
open.
it
leaves
itself
vulnerable
to
somebody
else
coming
in
and
making
an
appropriation
on
top
of
it.
now,
this
situation
can
occur,
it
has
occurred.
and
if
the
united
states
were
to
appropriate,
it
would
protect
itself
against
that.
but
once
the
united
states
has
secured
the
property
right,
has
declared
its
use
of
the
water
to
the
exclusion
of
other
uses,
we
do
not
think
that
state
law
can
control
the
particular
sort
of
use
that
the
united
states
makes.
mr.
rockwell
says,
“well,
how
--
how
can
the
united
states
acquire
a
greater
right
than
the
state
has
to
give?”
and
there,
the
answer,
it
seems
to
us,
abundantly
simple
where
it's
no
different
in
the
water
right
than
it
is
the
case
of
buying
the
post
office
site
or
anything
else.
the
united
states
buys
a
piece
of
land
for
a
federal
purpose
subject
to
a
zoning
restriction,
the
united
states
is
not
subject
to
the
zoning
restriction
or
other
police
regulations
itself.
in
that
sense,
the
united
states
does
simply
by
virtue
of
its
capacity
as
the
sovereign
government
have
greater
rights
than
any
other
person
can
have.
it
can
get
a
greater
right
than
the
state
has
to
give.
thank
you.
