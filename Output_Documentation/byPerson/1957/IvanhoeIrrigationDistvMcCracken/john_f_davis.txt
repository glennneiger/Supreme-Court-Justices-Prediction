mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please.
the
concern
of
the
united
states
with
the
outcome
of
this
case
is
that
since
1902
when
the
reclamation
act
was
passed,
the
united
states
has
spent
$3.25
billion
on
reclamation
projects,
almost
all
of
which
have
been
subject
to
this
160-acre
limitation.
in
this
project
alone
in
california,
$800
million
is
involved.
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
held
invalid
the
contracts
which
contained
this
limitation.
unless
this
judgment
is
reversed
or
unless
the
california
legislature
acts
or
congress
recedes
from
its
historic
position,
development
of
reclamation
projects
in
california
will
have
to
stop.
in
this
case,
i'm
happy
to
say
that
the
united
states
is
on
the
same
side
as
the
attorney
general
of
california
all
the
way,
and
in
view
of
our
many
arguments
with
respect
to
water
rights,
it's
a
pleasure
that
for
once
we
can
expand
together
on
the
water
rights
problem.
i
think
that
i
have
never
worked
on
a
case
where
the
really
simple
issues
that
are
involved
have
become
so
nearly
submerged
in
lawyer's
thought.
in
this
--
i
think
it
comes
from
the
nature
of
the
opinion
that
we're
dealing
with.
because
of
this
opinion,
lawyers
feel
that
on
one
side
we
feel
we
have
to
support
or
attack
everything
that
is
said
in
this
tremendous
volume
of
opinion.
and
as
a
result,
we
sometimes
forget
what
the
real
issues
in
the
case
are.
if
we
look
at
what
the
court
did
in
this
case
rather
than
what
the
court
said,
the
case
is
essentially
simple
and
i
think
will
give
us
no
difficulty.
what
the
court
did
was
to
decide
that
the
bureau
of
reclamation
had
no
authority
to
impose
a
160-acre
limitation.
and
that
i
submit
is
--
is
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
federal
law
which
this
court
had
jurisdiction
of.
now,
the
--
the
large
landowners
dispute
this.
they
say
that
the
court
did
not
decide
on
the
authority
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation
but
instead
decided
the
case
on
the
--
on
what
authority
the
irrigation
districts
in
california
had.
that
the
--
you
have
to
have
two
parties
through
a
contract
and
the
irrigation
districts
had
no
power
to
enter
into
this
contract.
the
contracts
are
void
for
that
reason.
most
specifically,
the
supreme
court
was
anxious
not
to
follow
that
route.
if
they
had
followed
that
route,
it
would
have
meant
cutting
off
water
in
california.
if
they
have
sustained
in
their
position
that
the
federal
government
had
no
power
to
impose
the
limitation,
then
the
water
continues
to
come
to
california
and
it
comes
to
california
without
the
160-acre
limitation.
but
if
on
the
other
hand
they
should
have
held
that
the
irrigation
districts
have
no
authority
to
make
this
contract
while
the
federal
government
has,
then
since
the
reclamation
bureau
is
under
injunction
from
congress
to
impose
the
condition,
it
would
merely
mean
that
it
would
stop
the
water
coming
entirely.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
reason
that
california
specifically
wanted
to
base
its
opinion
on
federal
law
rather
than
on
state
law
was
if
they
wanted
to
get
the
water
without
the
condition,
they
didn't
want
to
shut
off
the
water.
now,
the
--
the
decision,
the
specific
action
of
the
court
in
the
third
one
of
these
cases,
the
albonico
case
against
madera
irrigation
district,
makes
specific
what
i've
been
saying.
in
that
case,
we
didn't
have
a
procedure
to
validate
a
contract.
instead
we
had
a
mandamus
proceeding
by
a
person
who
held
excess
land.
and
he
brought
a
proceeding
to
have
the
district
ordered
to
do
one
of
two
things,
either
to
exclude
him
from
the
district
so
he'd
no
longer
be
subject
to
the
district
taxes,
or
to
require
that
the
water
be
given
him
without
restriction
to
his
excess
land.
the
superior
court,
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
in
the
case,
gave
him
this
relief
in
the
alternative.
they
said,
“the
district
should
either
exclude
him
and
excuse
--
excuse
him
from
paying
the
taxes,
or
they
should
give
him
water
for
all
of
his
land.”
the
supreme
court
of
california
specifically
said,
“he
is
entitled
to
the
water.
we
are
not
going
to
give
him
the
alternative
relief
because
he
is
entitled
to
get
this
water.”
so
they
struck
out
the
alternative
relief
and
just
said
that
he
should
get
the
water
for
all
of
his
entire
acreage.
it
is
impossible
for
the
supreme
court
to
have
reached
that
decision
unless
they
had
held
that
the
federal
reclamation
bureau
had
no
authority
to
impose
the
condition.
they
would
have
had
to
have
given
the
alternative
relief
unless
they
were
following
the
federal
ground.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
the
--
that's
the
madera
case,
the
albonico
case.
but
may
i
say
this,
that
the
decision
in
that
case
is
based
specifically
--
it
is
said
to
be
based
by
the
supreme
court,
is
said
to
be
based
on
the
ivanhoe
case.
so,
this
is
i
think
an
indication
by
the
court,
that
all
of
the
cases
are
decided
on
the
same
basis,
namely,
the
--
the
authority
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
i
think
it
is
time
that
we
got
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
there
are
really
two
questions
involved
in
the
merits.
the
first
of
the
question
of
construction
and
that
is,
did
congress
intend
the
160-acre
limitation
to
apply
to
the
lands
in
the
central
valley
project?
and
the
second
question
is
a
constitutional
question,
if
congress
intended
the
160-acre
limitation
to
apply
for
it
to
constitutionally
impose
it?
the
court
below
solved
the
interpretative
problem
by
saying
that
the
limitation
is
found
in
a
title
of
the
code
which
deals
with
public
lands
and
that
these
aren't
public
lands,
and
that
therefore,
the
limitation
should
be
construed
properly
to
apply
only
to
public
lands.
the
appellees
don't
even
present
that
argument
to
the
court.
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
attempt
to
support
it
or
not.
actually,
the
very
language
of
the
statute
makes
this
an
impossible
construction.
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
by
the
way
appears
in
the
appendix,
this
red-colored
volume
at
page
237
and
the
top
of
238,
refers
to
such
contracts
--
contract
or
contracts
with
irrigation
districts
here
and
before
referred
to
shall
further
provide
that
all
irrigable
land
held
in
--
held
in
private
ownership
by
any
one
owner,
and
then
it
goes
on
with
the
provisions
as
to
the
limitation.
and
in
doing
this,
it
--
it
followed
the
pattern
which
had
previously
been
followed
in
the
1902
act.
turning
back
two
pages
to
the
original
1902
act,
we
find
in
section
5,
no
rights
to
the
use
of
water
for
a
land
in
private
ownership
shall
be
sold
for
a
tract
exceeding
160
acres.
the
supreme
court
of
california
did
not
attempt
to
explain
its
interpretation
and
i
think
the
language
shows
that
it
is
improper.
the
argument
which
appellees
do
present
here
is
that
congress
has
shown
an
intent
to
follow
state
law
when
it
comes
to
the
distribution
of
water.
and
they
based
this
argument,
of
course,
upon
the
fact
that
section
8
of
the
original
1902
act
specifically
states
that
the
secretary
of
interior
in
carrying
out
his
duties
under
the
reclamation
acts
shall
follow
state
law.
this
is
the
same
act
i
may
say
which
at
the
same
time
said
that
no
water
shall
be
delivered
to
any
acreage
in
exact
--
in
excess
of
160
acres
in
one
ownership.
so
the
problem
there
is
really
a
problem
of
construction,
a
question
of
whether
the
--
the
injunction
to
the
secretary
of
interior
to
follow
state
law
shall
control
or
the
injunction
that
water
shall
not
be
delivered
to
more
than
a
160
acres.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
were
originally
in
the
--
in
the
1902
act.
we
are
specifically
concerned
with
--
with
the
1926
act
which
repeats
for
the
specific
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
find
--
yes,
well,
it's
the
--
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
with
section
5
which
is
the
acreage
limitation
appears
on
page
235
of
this
red-back
volume
and
section
8
is
on
236.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
when
we
rose
for
lunch,
i
was
discussing
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
federal
reclamation
law.
and
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
two
provisions
in
the
reclamation
law,
one
of
which
says
that
the
secretary
of
interior
shall
proceed
in
accordance
with
state
law
and
the
other
which
says
that
none
of
--
no
project
water
shall
be
distributed
to
acreage
exceeding
160
acres
in
one
--
one
ownership.
and
the
problem
which
is
before
the
court
is
to
determine
whether
which
one
--
which
of
these
provisions
shouldn't
affect,
prevail
or
whether
they
can
both
prevail
in
this
instance.
i
think
it's
made
easier
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
the
california
law
in
the
federal
cooperation
law
specifically
states
that
project
water
received
by
irrigation
districts
shall
be
distributed
in
accordance
with
the
acts
of
congress
and
rules
and
--
applicable
laws
of
congress
and
rules
and
regulations
thereunder.
but
in
any
event,
i
believe
that
the
specific
provision
for
160-acre
limitation
must
prevail
over
the
more
general
provision
which
deals
primarily
with
methods
of
appropriating
water
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
secretary
of
interior,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
achieved
its
water
rights
through
the
state
procedures
of
--
of
proper
appropriation.
unfortunately,
as
far
as
the
central
valley
project
is
concerned,
whatever
the
interpretation
we
might
otherwise
give
to
the
statutes,
subsequent
actions
in
congress
make
it
clear
that
congress
intends
the
160-acre
limitation
to
apply.
in
both
1944
and
1945,
specific
acts
were
introduced
in
congress
to
exempt
the
central
valley
project
from
the
160-acre
limitation
and
extensive
hearings
were
held
on
this
matter
and
in
both
cases,
congress
refused
to
pass
the
statutes
which
would
provide
the
exemption.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,the
bills
died
in
committee,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
will
say
that
bills
were
passed
and
those
were
the
appropriation
acts.
the
secretary
of
interior
reported
to
congress
time
and
time
again
with
respect
to
these
specific
contracts
and
this
specific
problem
of
a
160-acre
limitation.
and
congress,
with
this
--
with
this
information
before
them,
proceeded
to
appropriate
in
the
neighborhood
of
$400
million
for
the
carrying
of
the
project.
and
i
may
say
also
with
respect
to
the
santa
barbara
project
that
a
companion
project
where
the
water
was
to
be
delivered
through
underground
sources
to
what
the
reclamation
project
was
specifically
designed
to
replenish
underground
water.
congress
specifically
in
that
case
exempted
the
project
from
a
160-acre
limitation
and
for
the
very
easy
reason
that
no
one
could
distinguish
between
project
water
and
non-project
water
when
it
was
drawn
out
through
wells.
but
the
fact
that
congress
would
specifically
exempt
this
california
project
from
a
160-acre
limitation
would
be
an
indication
that
when
they
didn't
exempt
it,
they
meant
it
to
apply.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
is
where
the
160-acre
limitation
first
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
appeared.
the
one
that's
specifically
applicable
here
is
26.
mr.
john
f.
davis
congress
has
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
secretary
of
interior
and
bureau
of
reclamation
have
applied
it
in
all
projects
except
for
those
where
congress
has
made
other
--
other
provisions
uniformly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
want
to
correct
myself,
mr.
justice.
i'm
--
i
was
carried
away
by
my
enthusiasm
and
i
want
to
say
that
with
respect
to
the
imperial
valley
project,
there
was
an
interpretation
of
--
of
the
secretary
of
interior
limiting,
at
one
time,
limiting
the
application
of
--
i
think
exempting
it
from
a
160-acre
limitation.
i
don't
know
why.
it
isn't
the
present
view
but
there
is
that
exception
to
that
uniform
practice,
and
i
don't
know
the
basis
on
which
he
did
it
but
he
said
that
the
160-acre
limitation
did
not
appear
by
--
to
that
particular
project
at
one
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
have
indeed
and
we
have
collected
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
because
this
is
the
strongest
way
to
find
out
what
happened.
we
have
collected
in
many
pages,
i'm
afraid,
most
of
this
case
has
many
pages,
we've
collected
in
many
pages,
references
to
the
reports
--
to
specific
reports
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
the
actions
which
followed
after
this.
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
central
valley
and
on
santa
barbara
project
and
the
cachuma
project
too.
but
it
--
they're
--
they're
specifically
with
reference
to
these
projects.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
yes,
indeed.
the
--
and
that
again
is
specifically
pointed
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
--
to
our
brief.
i
think
that
it's
clear
beyond
doubt
that
congress
intended
--
intended
and
intends
the
160-acre
of
limitation
to
apply
and
i
think
we
can
--
we
should
pass
on
to
the
question
of
constitutionality.
congress
in
this
case,
the
federal
government
in
this
case
is
acting
under
its
welfare
--
under
the
welfare
clause.
it's
--
it's
spending
public
funds
for
the
public
welfare.
it
is
also
managing
its
own
property.
and
there
is
some
question,
the
questions
have
been
raised
as
to
how
much
affirmative
power
the
federal
government
has
to
impose
requirements
when
it
is
spending
its
money.
mr.
john
f.
davis
money
of
using
its
own
dams
and
--
but
--
and
disposing
of
water
which
is
stored
in
its
own
dams.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes,
indeed.
the
chester
dam
and
friant
dam
are
both
federal
--
federal
dams.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
--
i
think
that
congress
approves
of
projects
as
submitted
to
congress
with
the
report
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
congress
specifically
approves
the
--
the
interior
department
going
ahead
with
the
project
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
specifically
appropriates
money
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
was
direct
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
derelict
in
his
duty.
i
don't
know
what
--
whether
there
would
be
any
--
i
don't
know
what
the
--
what
the
remedy
would
be,
but
i
think
that
congress
has
clearly
adopted
this
reclamation
project
and
wanted
the
interior
department
to
go
ahead
and
--
and
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
now
that
is
a
little
different
but
they
direct
--
what
congress
instructs
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
do
is
to
distribute
the
water,
to
sell
the
water
to
irrigation
districts
only
if
they
will
contract
with
him
that
they
will
not
distribute
it
in
any
way
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
160
-acre
limitation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
then
--
well,
really,
the
question
is
can
he
attach
and
i
think
it's
a
reasonable,
good
condition
but
we'll
just
say
a
condition,
can
he
attach
a
condition
to
the
benefits,
to
accepting
the
benefits
which
he
has
no
specific
affirmative
power
to
attach.
let
me
give
you
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
now
talking
about
constitutional
power,
if
you
please,
like
in
interstate
commerce.
let
me
--
i
think
my
point
will
be
made
clear
if
i
referred
to
federal
trade
commission
against
idaho
where
permission
was
given
to
a
federal
--
to
a
power
company
to
build
lines
across
public
lands
and
the
court
felt
that
there
was
no
affirmative
power
and
they
were
talking
about
statutory
power,
but
there's
no
power
to
require
the
federal
the
--
the
power
company
to
--
to
carry
power
for
the
government
except
since
they
were
granting
a
right
to
go
across
public
lands.
it
was
a
reasonable
condition
to
attach
a
condition
and
they
could
say,
if
you
want
to
have
this
benefit,
you
must
live
up
to
the
condition
of
carrying
bonneville
power
across
your
lines,
and
that
is
the
situation
here.
we're
offering
water
to
the
irrigation
districts
and
we
say,
here
it
is
if
you
want
it,
but
if
you
want
it,
you
must
follow
a
--
a
rule
of
distribution
which
to
us
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
rule.
mr.
john
f.
davis
which
it
has
done
so.i
may
have
been
--
not
have
made
myself
clear
but
the
sections
--
they
didn't
do
it
in
1902,
but
in
the
1926
act
they
say,
the
contract
shall
contain
this
provision
and
that's
the
way
the
statute
is
--
is
worded.
that
the
contracts
of
the
irrigation
district
shall
contain
this
provision
within
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
i
--
i
think
the
secretary
--
the
--
the
court
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
supreme
court
--
the
supreme
court
says
that
applies
only
to
public
lands.
the
--
the
appellees
have
another
explanation.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
authority
is
direct.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
now,
if
we
would
have
a
slightly
different
question
if
we
were
imposing
this
against
the
policy
of
the
--
of
the
legislature
of
--
of
california.
i
think
our
problem
is
somewhat
simplified
by
the
fact
that
california
here
said
that
in
accepting
project
(inaudible)
the
california
irrigation
districts
shall
distribute
it
in
accordance
with
--
with
the
federal
law.
and
so,
we
come
to
the
question
whether
or
not
it'd
be
unconstitutional
to
take
from
the
large
landowners
rights
which
the
california
court
says
are
vested
in
them
to
receive
water
in
--
or
rather
in
--
in
accord
with
their
--
with
their
land
holdings
without
any
limitations.
mr.
john
f.
davis
from
this
project.
we
come
to
that
question,
does
--
does
this
--
is
this
taking
from
the
appellees
in
this
case
a
vested
right
without
due
process
of
law.
the
first
question
of
course
is
whether
they're
taking
anything
from
them
since
then
refusing
to
deliver
water
but
they
are
not
preventing
them
from
getting
water
from
any
other
source
which
they
might
want
to
get
it,
but
passing
that
question
which
is
essentially
a
state
question
we
come
to
this
proposition
which
i
think
this
court
has
passed
on
very
explicitly
and
that
is
that
the
united
states,
if
it
is
taking
a
right
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutionally
taking
the
right
because
we
have
the
right
of
eminent
domain
and
we
would
have
to
pay
them
for
any
rights
which
we
are
taking
from
them,
which
are
--
which
are
vested
and
which
they
probably
state
should
be
compensated.
i
say
that
the
courts
decided
upon
that
and
i
refer
the
case
to
the
court
of
the
united
states
against
gerlach
whether
in
the
same
reclamation
project,
the
united
states
in
cutting
off
the
flow
of
the
river
deprived
some
of
the
downstream
holders
of
certain
irrigation
benefits
which
they
got
from
the
flooding,
the
river
flooding
over
their
lands.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
it
was
--
the
court
held
that
this
was
a
vested
right,
a
right
which
was
vested
in
those
california
owners,
but
it
didn't
say
the
united
states
had
no
right
to
take
it.
the
united
states
had
a
right
to
take
it
but
the
united
states
had
to
pay
for
that
right.
and
so,
i
say
here
that
if
the
excess
landholders
in
--
in
the
central
valley
do
have
a
vested
right
in
the
water
which
we
are
not
delivering
to
them,
that
compensates
their
right
as
to
compensation
not
to
prevent
the
project
from
going
forward.
none
of
us
have
discussed
the
provisions
of
the
contracts
which
deal
with
the
delivery
of
the
water,
the
repayment
of
the
funds
and
the
title
to
the
projects
and
the
works.
i
think
that
these
problems
are
even
more
than
the
160-acre
limitation,
a
question
of
construction
of
the
federal
statute
and
--
and
i
must,
of
course,
rely
on
our
briefs
to
--
to
handle
those
problems.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
quite
right.
that
is
--
that
is
specifically
our
--
our
argument
that
deny
that
congress
had
specifically
authorized
this
type
of
contract
9
(e).
i
have
a
small
map
of
the
central
valley
project.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
have
the
map
before
it.
but
i
think
it
--
it
is
useful
background
material
and
if
i
may,
i
submit
a
copy
to
each
justice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
who's
hand
--
handed
me
similar
maps
for
the
santa
barbara,
the
consumer
project
which
i
will
send
up
at
the
same
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
when
there
are
state
rights
recognizable
under
state
law
which
are
infringed
through
carrying
out
this
project
the
remedy
of
the
california
landowner
is
a
remedy
of
condemnation.
it's
a
remedy
of
being
paid
for
the
right
which
is
taken
away,
not
a
right
to
specific
right
to
the
water.
in
the
--
in
the
gerlach
case,
there
was
no
disposition
to
say
that
the
united
states
had
no
right
to
cut
off
the
water,
with
the
friant
dam.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
--
if
--
if
--
that
is
--
that
--
that
is
quite
true.
there,
the
federal
government
was
as
here,
acquiring
its
water
rights
pursuant
to
--
to
state
law.
there's
no
question
about
that,
just
as
they
are
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
except
in
passing,
but
it
was
in
fact
involved
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
and
it
didn't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
but
it's
--
it
is
--
actually
what
--
what
happened
in
that
case
and
what
--
what
did
it
--
maybe
--
maybe
the
court
didn't
--
wouldn't
have
had
occasion
to
upset
it.
but
what
the
court
did
was
to
say
they
were
entitled
to
compensation
to
these
rights.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
yes.
i
think
that
is
right,
your
honor.
