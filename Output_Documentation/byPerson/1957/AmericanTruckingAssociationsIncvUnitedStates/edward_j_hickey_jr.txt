mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
appellants
in
number
8,
railway
labor
executives
association
et
al.
and
in
the
brief
time
allotted
to
me
for
oral
argument,
15
minutes,
i
would
like
to
address
my
self
if
i
may
to
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
basic
issue
on
the
statutory
power
question
which
has
been
raised
by
the
questions
put
in
my
colleague
by
mr.
justice
whittaker,
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
basically
the
problem
here
concerns
the
power
of
the
commission
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
allow
railroad
participation
in
the
motor
carrier
field
and
the
extent
to
which
they
are
permitted
by
statute
to
do
that.
it
is
true
as
counsel
has
said
that
for
a
period
of
20
years
the
commission's
consistent
practice
with
minor
exception
in
cases
which
have
never
been
contested,
has
been
to
read
into
the
provisions
of
section
207
which
are
the
certificate,
learning
sections
of
--
for
motor
carrier
certificate
to
public
convenience
and
necessity.
the
restrictive
criteria
contained
in
the
consolidation,
merger,
and
acquisition
section,
specifically,
the
language
and
the
restrictions
set
forth
in
section
5
(2)
(b),
if
i
may,
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
mention
that
they
are
set
forth
at
page
45
of
our
principal
brief.
we
also
filed
a
reply
brief,
it's
the
light
gray
covered
brief.
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
the
last
few
words
starts
the
proviso,
this
section
5
(2)
(b),
provided
that
if
a
carrier
by
railroad,
subject
to
this
part
or
any
person
which
has
control
by
such
a
carrier
or
affiliated
therewith
within
the
meaning
of
paragraph
6
is
an
applicant
in
the
case
of
any
such
proposed
transaction
involving
a
motor
carrier.
these
are
the
critical
words
which
follow
your
honors,
"the
commission
shall
not
enter
an
order
unless
it
finds
that
the
transaction
proposed
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest."
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
they
did
find
that
in
--
but
responsive
not
to
this
section
which
they
specifically
disavow
but
responsive
to
the
same
requirement
in
section
207.
and
will
enable
such
carrier
to
use
service
by
motor
vehicle
to
public
advantage
in
its
operations,
they
did
not
find
that.
they
specifically
state
in
their
report
that
they
are
not
required
to
so
find
and
will
not
unduly
restrain
competition.
there
again,
mr.
justice
black,
they
do
make
a
finding
with
respect
to
competition
but
not
pursuant
to
the
restrictions
of
section
5
(2)
(b).basically
then,
the
case
narrows
to
the
question
of
the
second
criteria
of
the
three
contained
in
section
5
(2)
(b)
namely,
whether
the
railroad
is
permitted
by
statute
to
enter
the
motor
carrier
field,
to
the
extent
of
carrying
on
an
unrestricted
motor
carrier
operation
as
distinguished
from,
one,
which
is
integrated
with
its
rail
operations
or
to
use
the
more
familiar
phrase
which
has
been
used
by
this
court
in
many
of
its
reports
and
by
the
commission
engaged
in
service
which
is
auxiliary
--
auxiliary
and
supplemental
to
its
rail
operations.
that
is
the
basic
problem
here.
now,
as
was
stated
for
over
20
years,
the
commission
has
consistently
followed
this
practice.
the
issue
between
the
commission
and
appellants
is
not
that
they
haven't
followed
the
practice
but
rather
one
of
--
that
they
have
followed
it
but
that
they
have
followed
it
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
the
commission
takes
the
position
in
its
report
that
it
has
the
discretion
to
apply
or
not
to
apply
the
criteria,
the
statutory
criteria
contained
in
section
5
(2)
(b),
when
entertaining
an
application
by
a
railroad
or
railroad
controlled
affiliate
to
directly
enter
the
motor
carrier
field
as
distinguished
from
acquiring
and
existing
motor
carrier
under
the
--
under
section
5.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
--
but
perhaps
i
didn't
make
my
self
clear.
they
--
they
treat
the
problem
this
way.
they
say
we
are
dealing
with
an
application
here
under
section
207
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it's
through
--
it's
via
railroad
act.
but
the
provisions
of
section
207
of
the
act
do
not
contain
the
restrictive
criteria
which
you
ask
us
to
apply.
those
provisions
are
contained
in
section
5
(2)
(b).
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
we
--
we
say
they
are
implied.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
we
say
you
have
to
read
the
act
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
will
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
will
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
on
this
very
point
from
the
texas
and
pacific
case
was
here.
the
commission
joined
by
its
then
staunched
and
faithful
ally,
the
united
states,
took
the
position
for
which
we
are
contending
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
commission,
not
joined
by
its
staunched
and
faithful
ally,
take
an
opposite
position.
i
don't
think
i'm
overstating
that.
the
--
the
reports
are
very
clearly
contained
the
same
argument
that
we
are
making
in
our
briefs,
the
brief
of
the
commission
and
the
united
states
which
is
a
joint
brief
but
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
precisely
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
there
isn't
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
it
is
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
but
you
see,
the
--
a
certain
area
of
credence
is
given
to
this
argument
which
perhaps
because
of
familiarity
with
it
in
other
years
down
through
a
number
of
years
both
in
the
department
of
justice
and
now
in
private
practice,
it
seems
to
me
an
astonishing
argument
that
congress
would
permit
the
railroad
to
directly
do
what
it
has
expressly
forbidden
that
it
may
not
indirectly
do.
and
that's
what
this
argument
amounts
to
that
--
and
i
say
a
certain
area
of
credence
is
given
to
the
argument
because
that
precisely
what
the
district
court
said.
the
district
court
first
assigned
this
issue
by
simply
stating
that
there
are
no
restrictive
criteria
contained
in
section
207
which
is
the
provision
of
the
act
under
which
the
commission
was
entertaining
this
application
by
the
railroad.
now,
our
argument
goes
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
they
are
--
they
are
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
it
indirectly
forbids
--
it
indirectly
forbids
--
i
used
the
word
indirectly
because
i'm
--
i'm
using
the
words
of
the
acquisition.
they
may
not
through
the
acquisition
of
a
motor
carrier
engage
in
motor
transportation
on
any
basis
other
than
a
basis
of
coordinated
rail
motor
transportation
or
auxiliary
and
supplemental,
to
the
rail
operations.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
by
acquisition.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
now,
the
other
i
say,
that
that
being
the
case
since
congress
has
expressly
limited
the
entrance
of
the
commission
into
the
field
--
of
railroads
into
the
motor
carrier
field
to
that
extent.
that
they
may
not
directly
apply
for
a
certificate
to
do
the
same
thing
either
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
exactly,
sir.
now,
let
me
very
quick
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
perfectly
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
not
at
all,
your
honor,
except
in
--
in
this
particular
context
it
is
for
the
simple
reason
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
--
that
this
statute
has
been
interpreted
in
this
way.
if
i
may
quickly
jump
over
the
chronology,
it
was
originally
contained,
these
restrictive
criteria
in
section
213
(a)
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
it
was
so
interpreted
then.
in
1938,
it
was
given
some
legislative
ratification
by
congress.
in
1940,
the
statute
was
reenacted
as
a
part
of
--
that
language
was
reenacted
as
a
part
of
section
5
(2),
a
proviso
on
section
5
(2)
(b)
in
the
light
of
this
consistent
practice
by
the
commission.
it
has
been
extended
and
as
i
say
consistently
applied
and
so
accepted
by
this
court.
there
are
four
decisions
of
this
court
which
deal
with
this
basic
problem.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
--
i
might
--
in
order
to
be
--
the
brief
--
the
act,
i'd
refer
the
court
to
the
statement
of
the
commission
in
their
report
because
this
--
the
position
which
counsel
is
taking
on
behalf
of
the
commission
in
its
brief
in
our
view,
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
the
parts
from
the
attitude
and
the
position
which
the
commission
took,
in
its
report
and
order
in
this
case
under
review.
at
page
105
of
the
record,
after
the
commission
had
reviewed
the
arguments
that
we
are
not
advancing,
the
commission
said
it
has
claimed
that
these
considerations
mean
that
we
do
not
have
statutory
authority
to
grant
applicant
an
unrestricted
certificate.
we
do
not
subscribe
to
this
view.
on
page
106
of
the
record,
one
more
sentence,
in
other
words,
we
may
issue
certificate
to
motor
carrier
affiliates
of
railroads
with
or
without
restrictions
as
the
circumstances
may
require.
now,
i
mentioned
that
to
show
that
in
our
view
the
report
in
order
that
this
under
review
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
the
commission's
position
that
it
has
the
discretion
to
apply
or
not
to
apply
the
statutory
restrictions
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
in
a
207
application
by
the
railroad.
it
is
particularly,
bad
we
feel
to
have
that
happen
in
this
case
because
actually,
the
only
purpose
of
the
filing
of
this
207
application
here
was
to
rid
itself
of
the
restrictions
which
had
been
imposed
by
the
commission
and
which
had
been
upheld
by
this
court.
in
the
rock
island
case,
reported
in
340
u.s.,
that
is
the
express
finding
of
the
examiner
of
the
commission
and
the
commission
itself
takes
no
exceptions
to
that
report.
at
page
23
of
our
brief,
we
have
quoted
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that
is
our
principal
brief,
your
honor,
the
light
gray
covered.
we
have
quoted
the
statement
by
the
commission
or
examiner
which
is
to
the
effect
that
motor
transit
here
is
not
even
seeking
new
routes,
new
authority
of
any
kind.
it
is
seeking
the
identical
authority
it
posses
prior
to
september
11,
1951,
when
the
restrictions
and
conditions
were
imposed
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
application
was
simply
to
rid
itself
of
those
conditions.
now,
we
say
that
particularly
under
these
circumstances
for
the
commission
to
say,
that
it
can
ignore
restrictions
placed
by
congress
on
the
extent
to
which
railroad
might
participate
either
directly
or
through
their
affiliates
in
the
motor
carrier
field
is
to
exhaust
the
form
of
substance.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
the
commission
does
not,
your
honor.
the
--
the
court
invited
us
to
comment
on
our
standing
to
sue
and
we
have
done
so
in
detail
in
the
brief.
the
only
reason
i
didn't
argue
with
it
is
i
wanted
to
get
what
i
considered
a
--
our
basic
reason
for
being
here.
and
i'm
content
to
rest
on
the
brief
unless
there's
some
questions
by
the
court
on
it.
