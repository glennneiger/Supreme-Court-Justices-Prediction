where
is
that
section
phrased
mr.
beardsley?
justice
felix
frankfurter
section
5?
and
that's
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
207
printed
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
one
of
the
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
printed
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
that's
what
i'm
looking
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
84?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
you
have
one
set
of
legislative
materials
and
they
another
or
you
draw
different
inferences
from
the
same
legislative
materials
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
the
question
of
having
us
read
it
and
then
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
is
right,
this
is
wrong,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
left
in
doubt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
be
left
in
doubt
after
reading
it
which
is
very
frequent
in
my
state
of
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
there
isn't
--
we've
got
the
same
body
of
materials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
this
is
on
the
--
on
the
insubstantiality
of
the
foundation
of
the
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'd
left
the
power
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
take
a
second
guess
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
explicit,
and
is
on
that
only
once
or
ought
to
report
which
has
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
39
of
your
main
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
1951?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
--
any
reference
to
this
matter
since
1951?
the
reason
i
asked
is
because
in
the
history
of
the
commission
as
i
need
hardly
to
tell
you
is
that
they
agree
--
they
have
change
their
mind
from
time
to
time
as
to
what
legislation
is
or
isn't
needed,
i
don't
mean
on
this
subject
but
(voice

--
justice
felix

1954.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
i
--
could
i
ask
you
not
argumentatively,
i
would
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
argumentative,
your
function.
but
please
state
where
the
commission
stated
in
the
clearest
way,
it's
construction
of
the
statute
which
on
the
mere
reading
of
it,
i
could
tell,
they
thought
what
they
did
in
this
case
is
beyond
their
power.
shall
i
put
my
questions
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
the
--
the
brief
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
i
mean
--
i
don't
care
about
what
the
commission
said
in
their
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
(inaudible)
sympathy
for
this
counsel
opposing
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
another's
briefs
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
where
in
the
report
of
the
commission
they
had
laid
down
prior
to
this
case
their
construction
of
the
statute
which
you
now
say
if
they
adhered
would
bar
what
they
did
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
your
view
then,
if
the
barker
case
represented
is
what
you
believe
to
be
relevant
to
the
present
case.
according
to
your
view
then,
you
invoke
through
that
long
continued
--
consistent
administrative
practice,
some
of
their
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
long
continued,
the
administrative
application
gives
meaning
where
there
is
doubt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
commission,
because
they'll
tell
us
what
they
contend.
but
are
you
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
commission
contend
their
discretion
to
follow
or
not
to
follow
the
statutory
criteria?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
implied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
implied,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
they
say
you
can
imply
them
or
not
as
--
as
the
commission
--
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
because
it
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
merely
means
that
the
statute
doesn't
require
them
to
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
if
the
statute
did,
they
can
exercise
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
we
can
agree
with
(inaudible).
if
a
statute
lays
down
criteria,
the
commission
has
no
choice
but
it
must
apply
those
criteria
whatever
flexibility
the
criteria
may
leave
it.
if
the
statute
does
not
lay
down
criteria
but
needs
more
maneuvering
grounds
of
the
commission
they
may
have
discretion
of
stiffening
to
limits
within
which
they
are
free
by
drawing
on
other
portions
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
if
it's
that,
the
latter,
you
must
contend
that
it's
the
former
that
the
statute
gives
them
no
choice
whether
by
express
words
or
when
we
get
through
with
it
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
implications
are
as
though
written
in.
that
must
be
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
--
is
that
necessary
equal
to
the
same
thing?
congress
may
have
a
policy
against
acquisition
with
all
the
consequences
of
concentration
of
that
and
may
not
have
a
policy
against
forbidding
subsidiary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
--
nothing
unusual
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
position
is
stronger
than
you
stated,
it
isn't
--
this
is
indirect
from
what
--
they
can't
be
direct,
but
your
position
is,
that
it
for
all
practical
purposes
written
into
the
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
a
very
different
thing
from
direct
and
indirect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
commission
broadly,
do
you
think
--
are
you
saying,
that
207
stands
by
itself
with
that
in
it
enforcement
the
commission
may
draw
consideration
of
policy
through
section
5?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
it
should,
what
extent
does
the
"should",
that
the
"should"
imply
a
reviewable
exercise
of
its
authority?
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they'd
say
we're
clear
that
this
would
be
a
--
this
would
eliminate
competition
and
we
don't
believe
in
competition
in
this
field.
you'd
say
that
as
a
clear
violation
of
its
duty
to
carry
out
a
policy
which
is
not
mechanically
or
automatically
enforceable
but
merely
one
of
the
considerations
of
public
necessities
and
conveniences,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
position
of
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
refreshing
my
recollection,
what's
the
--
what's
the
date
of
section
--
the
present,
what's
the
date
of
section
5,
the
origin,
what's
the
parent
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
section
5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
section
5
came
in
with
conception
with
the
current
position,
i
believe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
1920?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
it
--
wasn't
it
--
the
inceptions
in
the
first
transportation
act
of
1920?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
wasn't
--
this
is
important
for
me.
if
the
present
section
5
goes
back
to
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
i
don't
mean
to
come
--
i
don't
mean
the
--
take
that
or
--
or
in
the
extents
of
that.
i'm
talking
about
1920,
because
that's
where
section
5
comes
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
was
in
the
act
of
1920
and
therefore
was
there
when
congress
passed
the
act
for
the
motor
transportation
act
in
1935,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
of
my
dates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
there's
a
problem
there
as
to
whether,
when
congress
didn't
say
anything
in
terms
or
in
authority
to
the
expression
it
impliedly
inserted
as
it
argued
section
5
(inaudible)
isn't
that
the
position
of
the
other
side?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
1935.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
sequence
of
--
of
legislation,
it
has
to
consider
whether
at
the
time
this
came
in
to
the
act.
there
was
outstanding
a
provision
which
is
now
--
it
is
argued,
was
impliedly
read
into
a
new
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap)
question
is
that's
the
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
name
of
the
parker
case,
is
that
cited
in
your
brief
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i.c.c.and
parker?
justice
felix
frankfurter
here.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
always
simplify
your
position
of
the
commission
by
this
summary
of
--
that
section
5,
the
proviso
of
5
(b)
expressing
the
public
policy
which
is
binding
on
the
commission
to
the
extent,
to
then
extent
as
though
217
had
another
clause,
the
commission
must
take
into
account
the
other
case
involved
in
the
(inaudible)
where
the
question
was
that.
the
commission
was
taken
into
account
the
public
policy
expressed
by
--
by
the
proviso
and
further
that
you
say
the
commission
did
include
--
count
on
these
records.
does
that
oversimplify
the
position
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
going
to
ask
you
a
question
if
(inaudible)
that
answer.
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
were
reasons
for
not
moving
in
for
modifications
from
1938
certificate,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
wanted
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
were
an
--
since
this
was
a
new
proceeding
and
i
don't
quite
follow
except
you
need
t
to
file
with
the
commission
for
third
judicial
notice
at
a
court
and
things
by
which
you'd
translate
judicial
notice
and
i
don't
quite
follow
that
they
can
make
an
order
in
19,
whatever
this
was
made.
whether
1954,
1955?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1954
on
the
basis
of
finding
made
in
1938,
the
presupposition
of
which
of
--
of
such
statement,
of
such
a
position
being
that
the
findings
of
1938
hold
from
1954.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
they
--
that
exact
--
determine
the
basis
of
the
acquisition
in
1938
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
understand
whatever
is
necessary
for
1938
was
established.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
if
you
wanted
something
new
and
different
in
1954
and
brought
a
new
proceeding
to
that
end
whether
the
new
proceeding
must
not
furnish
new
finding
even
though
the
commission
may
find
on
a
scrutiny
on
a
quick
reconnaissance
that
the
positions
haven't
changed.
but
if
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they've
already
found
in
1938,
the
implication
of
that
is
that
those
conditions
must
have
continued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
your
answer
is
that
the
--
the
certificate
that
was
granted
and
the
lifting
of
the
restriction
was
not
bases
on
the
record
made
in
1938.
it
was
made
on
a
--
on
a
record
made
in
1954.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why,
i
didn't
understand
your
answer,
i
think,
it
was
justice
brennan
that
--
oh,
they
found
all
this
things
in
1938,
they
didn't
have
to
bother
again.
i
don't
follow
that.
these
things
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
seem
what?
in
order
to
sustain
this
order
in
1952,
it
must
be
based
on
a
state
of
affair
in
existence
in
1954
--1952,
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
i
must
i
--
i
can
only
go
to
this
record
to
find
out
whether
the
certificate
is
well
founded
and
rooted
on
fact
established
in
1952
and
the
other
two
that
ought
--
what
was
true
in
1938
including
excluded
1952.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
if
you
have
that.
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
to
say
the
stuff
1938
they
didn't
have
to
bother
again.
i
didn't
understand
that
defined
in
injunction
with
your
statement
to
chief
justice
that
you
should
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
main
argument,
i
follow
is
that
we
may
understand
that
answer.
that's
what
the
answer
as
the
record
shows.
