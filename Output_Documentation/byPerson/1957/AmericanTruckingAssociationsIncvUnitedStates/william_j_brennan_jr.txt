brennan,
jr.
mr.
beardsley,
may
i
ask,
the
icc
order
in
this
instance
has
some
reservations
in
it,
does
it
not?
that's
--
that's
the
right
word.
in
any
event,
it's
something
that
the
commission
made
anytime
reexamined,
is
that
--
is
that
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
is
it
at
least
sufficient,
for
example
to
enable
your
client
at
any
time
on
additional
facts
or
the
like
to
ask
the
commission
to
reopen
and
reconsider?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
those
are
ineffective
because
illegal
or
outside
the
authority
that
the
commission
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
attach
to
the
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
information
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
bring
into
action
that
reservation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
howland,
this
was
an
original
proceeding
now,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
actually,
in
effect
which
you've
been
telling
us
is
just
a
step
in
their
business
from
the
beginning,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
history
of
it,
it's
just
another
step
in
the
long
stage
of
it,
is
that
it?
since
you
first
