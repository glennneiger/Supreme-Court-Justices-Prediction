justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
question
of
question
of
power,
you
say,
there
is
no
power
in
the
commission
to
make
this
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
you
read
207
or
would
like
to
have
207
read
as
it
provided
that
no
such
application
should
be
granted
if
the
motor
carrier
is
owned
by
a
railroad.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
the
legislative
history
doesn't
prove
much?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
--
does
the
commission
raised
any
question
about
your
standing
representing
the
railroad
employees
to
complain
about
this
business?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
point
there
being
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
resorting
to
207
that
the
same
relief
that
had
been
granted
by
an
application
to
enlarge
the
certificate
in
the
5
(b),
original
5
(b)
proceedings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
converse
of
that
is,
i
assume
what
you
read
here
that
they're
talking
about
a
modification
applied
in
these
proceedings
does
not
mean
necessarily
indicate
their
view
as
to
what
the
limitations
were
in
207.
