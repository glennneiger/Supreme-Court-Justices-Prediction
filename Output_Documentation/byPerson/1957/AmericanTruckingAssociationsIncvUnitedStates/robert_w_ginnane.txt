mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
please,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
rock
island
railroad.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
briefly,
the
rock
island
railroad
had
the
subsidiary
rock
island
motor
transit
incorporated.
and
then
in
1938,
the
commission
authorized
motor
transit
to
acquire
what
was
known
as
the
white
line
route.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
that
time
what
the
commission
did,
it
authorized
the
acquisition
submit
to
a
reservation
which
it
imposed,
to
impose
future
conditions
to
limit
its
operations
to
service
supplementary
and
auxiliary
to
rail
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
(voice
overlap)
partial
answer
right
now
that
i'd
like
to
develop
it
in
more
detail
later.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
contrary
to
what
our
friends
had
just
said,
in
the
original
barker
acquisition,
the
leading
barker
acquisition
case,
the
commission
at
that
time
--
now,
let
me
quote
briefly
from
it.
this
is
back
in
1937.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
was
an
acquisition
case
and
that
the
leading
case
on
acquisitions
that's
been
quoted
ever
since
extensively
by
--
by
the
appellants.
in
that
same
case,
the
commission
added
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
page
38
of
the
commission's
brief,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
should
the
restriction
prohibiting
service,
the
points
which
are
not
--
comes
with
registrations
make
it
impractical
or
uneconomical
to
operate
over
any
route.
steps
may
be
taken
to
obtain
modification
of
a
term,
the
authority
granted
herein.
and
then
again,
by
way
of
a
qualification
of
its
decision
of
the
barker
case.
and
this
is
back
in
1937,
nor
do
our
conclusions
overlook
the
interest
of
the
shipping
public
along
the
routes
here
considered.
if
as
a
result
of
proceedings
initiated
by
shippers,
it
had
shown
after
full
hearing
that
existing
transportation
facilities
are
inadequate
or
otherwise
unsatisfactory
at
a
point
in
connection
with
which
service
is
prohibited
under
the
terms
the
order
herein.
that
is
a
point
which
was
not
even
a
railroad
station,
an
off
railroad
point.
such
evidence
may
be
a
basis
for
our
removing
the
restriction
in
the
pertinent
certificate
and
ordering
the
present
applicants,
that
is
the
rail
affiliate,
to
render
service
to
that
point.
so,
in
the
very
early
and
leading
acquisition
case
in
which
the
plaintiffs
rely,
the
commission
started
to
interpret
the
proviso
as
leaving
at
some
flexibility
to
provide
for
a
special
public
need
for
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
this
case,
rock
island
motor
transit
has
been
authorized
to
serve
only
points
which
are
--
our
stations
on
the
rock
island
railroad,
with
the
exception
of
about
three
villages
at
the
west
end
of
the
route.
and
hereon
east,
all
the
points
authorized
to
be
served
are
stations
on
the
rock
island
railroad.
and
what
i'm
pointing
out
in
--
in
reading
from
the
barker
decision
that
from
the
beginning
in
1937,
the
commission
took
the
position
under
section
5
in
an
acquisition
case
that
would
authorize
service
even
the
points
not
served
by
the
railroad,
of
course,
that
points
near
the
railroad
in
the
service
--
the
railroad's
general
service
area.
but
the
points
not
even
served
by
the
railroad,
if
necessary,
to
meet
the
public's
need
for
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
and
the
commission
really
specifically
says
so
in
its
report
in
this
case
at
page
109.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
could
--
they
may
well
be
different
things
and
your
honors
may
find.
let
me
bring
this
out
at
this
point.
in
1945,
the
commission
reopened
the
two
acquisition
cases
involving
motor
transit
here,
are
the
case
in
which
the
commission
had
authorized
motor
transit
to
acquire
the
white
line.
that's
the
eastern
segment
of
the
route
here
involved.
and
the
second
acquisition
case
in
which
the
commission
had
authorized
motor
transit
to
acquire
the
frederickson
line,
that's
the
western
segment
of
the
route
here
involved.
to
determine
what
conditions
or
restriction
should
be
imposed
upon
motor
transit's
operations,
and
then
these
reopened
proceedings,
motor
transit
specifically
refused
to
introduce
evidence
as
to
the
public's
need
for
its
unrestricted
motor
carrier
service
to
these
points.
it
stood
squarely
and
solely
on
the
legal
position
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
reopen
it's
certificates
to
impose
such
conditions.
presented
to
that
challenge,
the
commission
just
automatically
imposed
the
five
restrictive
conditions
and
in
that
posture,
the
case
came
up
through
the
courts
to
this
court
in
the
first
rock
island
case,
involving
only
the
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
impose
the
conditions.
and
that
question
was
tested
on
the
--
on
the
practically
naked
record
as
it
was.
solely,
as
a
question
of
statutory
power
to
impose
those
restricted
conditions.
now,
those
conditions
are
at
pages
5
and
6
of
our
brief.
stated
briefly,
they
are
that
motor
transit
service
shall
be
restricted
to
service
which
is
auxiliary
to
or
supplemental
of
the
train
service
of
the
rock
island
railroad.
now,
that
raised
auxiliary
and
supplemental
as
used
in
the
first
condition
meant
under
the
commission's
prior
decisions,
restricted
to
service,
restricted
to
the
movement
of
shipments
on
railroad
bills
of
lading,
and
of
railroad
rates.
that's
what
auxiliary
and
supplemental
was
shorthand
for,
these
shipments
and
railroad
bills
of
lading
and
of
railroad
rates.
the
second
condition,
service
to
be
restricted
to
points
which
are
stationed
on
the
rock
island
railroad.
the
third
was
of
key
point
restrictions,
key
points
being
omaha,
des
moines
and
the
tri-city
area
or
the
contractual
arrangements
between
motor
transit
and
its
rail
parent
should
be
reported
to
and
subject
to
revision
by
the
commission.
and
fifth,
reservation
by
the
commission
of
power
--
by
the
commission
of
power
to
impose
further
conditions.
in
1951,
this
court
sustained
the
commission's
power
to
impose
the
five
conditions.
following
this
court's
decision,
motor
transit
filed
an
application
under
section
207
for
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
which
in
substance
that
the
appellant
say
would
authorize
it
to
serve
the
points
on
this
route
without
the
five
restrictive
conditions.
and
in
the
long
hearing
in
this
application,
the
motor
transit
for
the
first
time
produced
evidence
as
to
public
need
for
its
unrestricted
services,
motor
service
at
this
point.
and
in
november
1954,
the
commission
authorized
motor
transit
to
serve
these
points
to
transport
general
commodities
subject
to
the
following
conditions.
the
conditions
appear
on
the
record
at
page
117.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
117,
sir.
first,
that
there
may
be
attached
from
time
to
time
that
the
privilege
granted
herein
such
reasonable
terms,
conditions,
and
limitations
as
to
public
convenience
and
necessity
may
require.
now,
there
has
been
contended
by
the
appellants
that
that
is
a
meaningless
futile
gesture.
well,
the
commission
did
not
so
regard
it
because
it
discussed
the
matters
specifically
on
its
report.
at
page
115,
the
next
of
the
last
paragraph,
the
commission
states,
"applicant
seeks
unrestricted
authority
and
we
are
satisfied
that
the
grant
of
authority
herein
and
after
made
should
be
free
of
restrictions
except
the
one
previously
discussed
and
in
addition,
one
whereby
we
show
retained
jurisdiction
to
impose
in
the
future
whatever
restrictions
or
conditions
if
any
appear
unnecessary
in
the
public
interest
by
reason
of
material
changes
in
conditions
or
circumstances
surrounding
applicant's
operations
in
relation
to
those
of
competing
motor
carriers."
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
normally
and
primarily,
complaints
in
competing
motor
carriers.
and
may
i
say
on
the
--
on
the
side
as
it
were,
the
--
there
is
a
--
a
very
bitter
competitive
relationship
between
these
molds
of
competition.
if
motor
transit
starts
to
really
shove
around
its
independent
motor
carrier
competitor,
there
will
be
no
lack
of
complaints.
the
second
condition
which
the
commission
imposed
and
report
now
before
the
court,
was
that
contractual
arrangements
between
motor
transit
and
its
parent
shall
be
reported
to
--
to
and
subject
to
revision
by
the
commission
which
is
identical
with
condition
five
of
the
prior
five
conditions
which
was
sustained
by
this
court.
also,
as
the
map
shows
that
at
--
that
except
for
a
few
small
villages
on
the
west
end
route,
motor
transit
service
is
limited
under
the
commission's
present
order,
the
points
which
are
stationed
on
the
rock
island
railroad.
that
is
substantially
prior
condition,
too.
so,
what
the
commission
did
here
after
a
hearing
on
public
convenience
and
necessity
was
to
remove
the
restriction
first
of
rail
billing
and
at
rail
rates.
and
secondly,
the
key
point
restriction.
and
the
commission
did
so,
on
the
ground
that
the
proposed
operations
by
motor
transit
would
not
unduly
restrain
competition.
and
that
that
service
was
required
to
meet
a
need
for
motor
service
which
other
carriers
could
not
provide.
now,
the
opposed
argument
has
a
real
sweep,
they
contend
that
--
that
the
commission
must
in
all
circumstances,
that
they
admit
it
in
their
brief.
it
must
be
in
all
circumstances,
to
restrict
the
railroad's
motor
carrier
operations
to
service
which
is
on
some
way
combined
with
a
train
service
of
the
railroad.
for
example,
they
asked
this
court
to
reverse
its
decision
in
the
parker
case
and
to
hold
as
of
--
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
such
motor
carrier
operations
by
a
railroad,
it
must
be
limited
to
shipments
which
have
a
prior
or
subsequent
movement
by
rail.
now,
the
commission
contends
that
this
proviso
of
section
5
doesn't
--
is
not
to
be
read
into
section
207
as
a
rigid
limitation
of
the
issuance
of
certificates
authorizing
new
or
additional
service.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
until
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
commissioner
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
put
it
a
bit
stronger.
it
is
said
that
it
should
draw
a
consideration
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
of
policy
both
from
the
national
transportation
--
national
transportation
policy
and
specifically
from
section
5.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
--
at
the
extremes
which
we
call
abuse
of
power
but
there
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would,
sir.
now,
this
court
has
already
held
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case
that
the
commission
is
empowered
to
restrict
a
certificate
issued
to
a
railroad
affiliate
to
service
which
is
auxiliary
and
supplemental
to
the
--
to
the
rail
service
in
the
specific
sense
of
limitation
to
the
transportation
of
shipments
on
railroad
bills
of
lading
and
of
railroad
rates
and
subject
to
key
point
restrictions.
the
court
has
never
considered
the
extent
to
which
the
commission
must
do
so
or
whether
it
must
do
so
on
all
circumstances.
so,
if
again
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
section
213,
but
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
this
--
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
but
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
1940,
transportation
act
1940.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
yes.
there
was
an
extensive
section
5
there
on
railroad
consolidations
only.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
section
5
as
it
appeared
in
the
1920
act
brought
into
the
act
extensive
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
provisions
dealing
with
railroad
consolidations.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
present
proviso
in
section
5
originated
in
section
213
of
the
motor
carrier
act.
in
section
213
as
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935
and
that
section
213
was
a
separate
provision
dealing
with
mergers
and
consolidations
of
motor
carriers
only.
then
on
the
--
in
the
general
revision
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
213
was
consolidated
with
section
5.
and
this
proviso
was
moved
to
what
is
now
section
5.
and
i'd
like
to
make
this
very
clear
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
sir.
but
i
have
to
add
in
fairness.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
have
to
add
in
fairness
that
the
draftsman
in
1940
made
it
clear
in
the
committee
reports
that
when
they
were
transferring,
this
proviso
from
the
then
section
213
to
section
5.
they
--
they
do
not
mean
any
change
in
the
existing
law
whatever
that
was.
so,
we've
gone
back
to
the
original
legislative
history
in
1935
of
the
motor
carrier
act
and
it
seems
to
us
a
--
a
fair
characterization
of
that
history
was
that
no
one
at
that
time
had
a
precise
idea
as
to
the
extent
or
nature
of
the
motor
carrier
operation
which
railroad
should
be
allowed
to
conduct.
commissioner
eastman
pointed
out
to
the
committees
that
the
railroads
were
experimenting
in
some
directions
with
motor
carrier
service
and
that
he
had
hoped
that
they
would
continue
to
experiment.
and
for
the
rest
of
testimony
before
the
--
and
the
hearings
before
the
committees
and
they
have
given
some
samples
of
it
in
our
brief,
was
just
in
the
general
vein
that
there
should
be
some
restriction
and
rail
acquisition
of
motor
carrier
operations
as
they
said,
unless
the
railroads
can
acquire
all
of
their
motor
trucks
and
motor
buses
unless
restore
to
them
the
monopoly
which
they
so
long
enjoy.
there's
nothing
in
that
1935
history
which
gives
any
specific
content
to
the
key
phrase
in
this
proviso
will
enable
such
railroad
to
use
service
by
motor
vehicle,
the
public
advantage
in
these
operations
and
nothing
at
all
was
said
as
to
whether
that
proviso
should
be
read
literally
and
rigidly
into
the
certificate
provisions
of
section
207.
all
we
can
conclude
from
the
--
from
the
original
1935
history
is
that
at
that
time,
congress
was
not
ready
to
specifically
prescribe
the
railroad's
role
in
motor
carrier
operations.
rather,
it
limited
itself
to
stay
a
broad
objective
of
preventing
a
railroad
monopolization
of
a
--
of
a
new
mode
of
transportation
motor
carriage.
we
think
it
deliberately
left
the
commission
with
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
in
implementing
that
objective.
now,
when
the
act
was
amended
and
not
--
when
the
motor
carrier
act
was
amended
in
1938
and
then
when
in
1940,
the
motor
carrier
act
was
combined
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
both
extensively
revised,
congress
still
apparently
was
not
prepared
to
define
any
further
what
the
precise
role
of
railroads
and
motor
transportation
should
be.
and
that
unwillingness
to
go
further
into
the
matter
is
vividly
illustrated
by
the
history
of
the
shipstead
amendment
in
1938.
now,
that
arose
out
of
two
cases,
two
early
cases
decided
by
the
commission.
one
of
was
the
barker
case
in
which
the
commission
began
to
develop
this
concept
of
service,
auxiliary
and
supplemental
to
the
railroad
service.
but
in
the
same
year
with
the
barker
case
in
1937,
the
commission
took
the
flat
position
on
the
st.
andrews
bay
transportation
company
case
that
the
proviso
did
not
apply
in
the
issuance
of
certificates
authorizing
new
or
additional
service,
motor
carrier
service
by
railroads.
senator
shipstead
disagreed
with
the
commission's
conclusion
and
result
in
the
st.
andrews
bay
case.
so,
he
introduced
an
amendment
which
would
specifically
and
in
terms,
written
into
section
207,
this
present
proviso
section
5.
his
amendment
was
dropped
or
rather
he
withdrew
it
and
in
fairness,
he
apparently
did
it
for
two
reasons.
first,
everybody
told
him
all
segments
of
the
industry
are
the
members
of
congress,
this
is
a
controversial
matter
being
introduced
into
a
--
into
a
relatively
non-controversial
bill.
if
you
press
this,
we'll
get
no
legislation
in
this
session.
and
the
second
factor,
commissioner
eastman
and
two
other
members
the
commission
indicated
to
senator
shipstead
that
probably,
they
would
agree
with
him
in
the
interpretation
of
the
act.
but
nevertheless
between
1938
and
1940,
the
commission
repeated
again
and
again
in
published
decisions
its
view
that
the
proviso
did
not
control
proceedings
under
section
207.
but
still
on
the
general
revision
of
1940,
the
commission
--
congress
did
nothing
to
reverse
that
interpretation.
now,
in
the
st.
andrews
bay
case,
to
develop
further
how
the
commission
has
interpreted
this.
the
commission
took
a
rather
flat
ball
position
that
the
proviso
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
granting
of
certificates
under
207.
well,
the
succeeding
cases
and
with
experience,
the
commission
began
to
qualify
that
view.
the
early
cases
that
began
to
emphasize
the
element
of
shippers'
special
need
for
service.
it
also
began
to
develop
that
the
particular
proposed
service
by
railroads
would
not
have
an
undue
competitive
effect
upon
independent
motor
carriers.
and
in
1938,
as
early
as
1938,
in
what
our
friends
refer
to
as
the
leading
kansas
city
southern
transportation
company
case
and
it
is
a
leading
case.
the
commission
developed
and
applied
the
general
policy
that
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances,
it
would
restrict
certificates
issued
to
railroads
under
section
207
to
service
auxiliary
and
supplemental
to
the
railroad
service.
now,
in
1946
in
the
rock
island
motor
transit
company
purchased
white
line
motor
freight.
that
was
the
commission
report
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
first
rock
island
case.
the
entire
commission
stated
in
detail
its
view
of
the
relationship
between
the
proviso
of
section
5
and
section
207.
first,
the
commission
pointed
out
as
it
always
have
that
section
207
doesn't
contain
any
specific
restriction
on
the
issuance
of
certificates
for
new
or
additional
service
to
railroads.
but
the
commission
added,
and
i
quote,
"giving
effect
however
to
the
national
transportation
policy
as
declared
by
the
congress
and
as
colored
by
the
proviso
of
section
5,
it
has
been
consistently
recognized
in
proceedings
under
section
207
that
except
where
unusual
circumstances
prevail,
every
grant
to
a
railroad
or
to
a
railroad
affiliate
of
authority
to
operate
as
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
or
to
acquire
such
authority
by
purchase
or
otherwise
should
be
conditioned
so
as
to
limit
the
future
service
by
motor
vehicle
to
that
which
is
auxiliary
to
or
supplemental
of
the
rail
service."
and
since
1946,
the
special
circumstances
document
of
the
white
line
case
has
been
cited
and
applied
by
the
commission,
in
both
acquisition
cases
and
on
certificate
cases
under
section
207
and
in
both
imposing
and
then
omitting
or
modifying
restrictive
conditions.
then
coming
to
the
report
of
the
commission,
which
is
now
before
the
court,
it
was
issued
in
1954.
the
commission
again
took
the
position,
that
the
proviso
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
does
--
does
not
as
--
itself
as
a
direct
rigid
matter
restrict
the
issuance
of
certificates
for
new
service
under
207.
but
again
it
noted
that
beginning
with
the
kansas
city
southern
case
of
1938,
it
had
followed
a
general
policy
of
imposing
the
five
auxiliary
service
restrictions
upon
certificates
issued
to
railroads.
and
the
commission
added,
that's
in
the
report
in
this
case,
the
main
purpose
for
the
policy
of
imposing
the
five
above
ordered
restrictions
or
modifications
thereof
was
to
prevent
the
railroads
from
acquiring
motor
operations
through
affiliates
and
using
them
in
such
a
manner
as
to
unduly
restrain
competition
of
independently
operated
motor
carriers.
this
policy
wasn't
as
sound
and
should
be
relaxed
only
with
a
circumstances
clearly
established
that
the
grant
of
authority
has
not
resulted
and
probably
will
not
result
in
the
undue
restrain
of
competition
and
that
the
public
interest
requires
the
proposed
operation,
which
the
authorized
independent
motor
carriers
had
not
furnished
except
for
it
suited
their
convenience.
but
from
the
1937
to
the
present
time,
the
commission
has
consistently
held
that
the
proviso
is
not
to
be
read
under
section
207
as
a
rigid
limitation.
rather,
the
commission
believes
that
read
with
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
commission
must
take
it
into
account
and
it
does
as
a
general
policy
to
be
applied
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
st.andrews
bay
transportation
company
case
in
1937.
we
submit
that
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
long
continued,
unknown
to
congress,
unknown
to
the
industry
as
a
rational
basis
that
should
be
sustained.
and
we
submit
further
that
this
court
has
already
recognized
that
the
proviso
of
section
5
comes
into
play
only
as
in
certificate
cases
under
section
207,
only
as
a
general
policy
against
rail
monopoly
to
be
--
to
be
balanced
against
the
public
need
for
transportation
service.
and
we
find
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
parker
case
in
326
u.s.in
which
this
court
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
"section
207
(a)
provides
for
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
on
application
at
the
proposed
service
is
or
will
be
required
by
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
or
necessity.
no
other
provisions
are
here
involved."
also
in
that
case,
this
court
looked
to
the
--
to
the
national
transportation
policy
and
its
relationship
to
the
problem
of
this
case.
and
the
court
recognized
that
--
that
the
national
transportation
policy
and
it's
relation
to
this
case,
this
type
of
case,
has
two
purposes,
preserving
the
inherited
badges
of
each
mode
of
transportation,
here
specifically,
motor
carrier
transportation
and
at
the
same
time,
meeting
shipper's
need
for
transportation.
the
court
recognized
that
these
objectives
sometimes
overlap
and
then
--
on
that
where
they
overlap,
the
commission
has
an
important
function
to
perform
in
balancing
and
reconciling
the
different
congressional
objectives.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
parker?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
parker
case.
it's
interstate
commerce
commission
versus
parker
in
326
u.s.at
60.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
we
think
this
court's
decision
on
the
first
rock
island
case
is
even
more
specific.
there,
the
court
said,
may
i
quote
briefly,
"although
section
207
providing
for
the
issuance
of
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity
has
no
clause
requiring
special
justification
for
railroads
to
receive
motor
carrier
operating
rights
such
as
appears
in
the
proviso
in
section
5.
the
commission
applies
the
rules
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
so
as
to
read
the
proviso
under
section
207
in
order
to
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
motor
carrier
service."
and
the
commission
has
said
in
--
in
the
white
--
in
the
white
line
case
and
it's
reported
in
this
case,
it
does
indeed
left
to
the
national
transportation
policy
and
--
and
to
the
policy
of
section
5
even
in
cases
under
207.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
we
--
it
was
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
--
we
cite
a
number
of
them,
and
quote
from
some
of
them
beginning
on
page
41,
santa
fe
trail
stages,
burlington
transportation
extension,
interstate
lines
extension.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
--
we
did
not
report
to
make
an
exhaustive
enumeration.
also,
in
the
--
in
the
prior
rock
island
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
they
did
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
they
did
not.
they
were
decided
and
--
and
under
the
commission's
view,
that's
--
they
were
certificate
cases
for
a
new
or
additional
service
under
--
under
section
207
that
it
was
not
required
to
make
those
findings.
also,
in
the
rock
island
opinion,
this
court
pointed
out
undoubtedly,
the
commission
has
not
consistently
required
each
rail
affiliate
and
motor
carrier
to
forego
motor
billings
or
tariffs.
key
points
to
break
traffic
are
relatively
new.
rail
affiliates
have
been
committed
to
leave
the
line
of
the
railroad
to
serve
communities
without
other
transportation
service.
these
divergences
however
are
an
exercise
of
the
discretionary
and
supervisory
power
with
which
congress
has
endowed
the
commission.
and
in
support
of
that
--
and
of
that
support
of
that
conclusion,
this
court
cited
the
commissions
decision
on
the
white
line
case,
to
which
i
referred
a
few
minutes
ago,
as
well
as
this
decision
in
the
wellman
case,
in
which
the
commission
acting
under
207
had
authorized
a
railroad
to
meet
and
perform
unrestricted
motor
service
to
points
on
its
station
where
there
was
a
peculiar
need
for
service.
at
the
same
time,
we
contend
that
this
court
has
already
in
effect
in
that
and
disposed
of,
the
appellant's
argument
that
this
construction
of
section
207
will
defeat
and
evade
the
policy
of
the
proviso
of
section
5.
or
even
if
the
proviso
applies
in
section
207
cases,
we
take
this
court
has
already
recognized
particularly
in
the
rock
island
case
that
it
does
not
embody
any
specific
and
universal
restriction
of
motor
carrier
operations
by
a
railroad
to
service
a
--
railroad
bills
of
lading,
rail
rates
or
to
service
which
--
or
to
shipments
which
have
a
prior
or
subsequent
movement
by
rail.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
show
the
effect
on
competition?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
think
so,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
one
if
the
unique
features
of
this
case
if
i
may
sort
of
break
over
the
division
of
argument
with
counsel
for
motor
transit.
one
of
the
unique
features
of
this
case
is
the
basis
which
the
commission
had
for
it's
conclusion,
the
rock
island's
operations
in
the
past
and
the
probable
future
would
not
have
produced
an
undue
restraint
on
competition
was
in
the
circumstance
that
between
1938
to
1951,
a
period
of
about
13
years,
motor
transit
was
in
fact
operating
on
this
route
without
any
restrictions.
during
that
period
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
1951.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
period
of
about
13
years.
motor
transit
operated
on
this
route
without
any
restrictions
and
during
that
period
in
brief,
its
competitors
prospered.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
almost
uniquely,
the
commission
did
not
have
to
make
a
purer
prediction
or
prophecy
as
to
what
the
effect
on
competition
would
be.
it
--
it
had
a
record
of
13
years
up
to
the
three
years
of
its
decision
in
this
case
in
which
they
judged
what
the
competitive
effect
would
be.
and
then
in
addition,
the
commission
imposed
conditions
which
in
effect
leave
motor
transit
under
continuing
surveillance
by
the
commission
in
its
relationship
with
its
--
in
its
competing
relationships
with
independent
motor
carriers
in
that
general
area.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
motor
transit
is
now
operating
under
a
--
under
a
temporary
certificate
which
contains
two
limitations.
one
limits
them
--
one
of
the
limitations
limits
them
to
shipments
not
exceeding
5000
pounds
and
--
and
the
other
limitation
imposes
these
two
key
point
restrictions,
chicago
and
omaha.
but
until
--
but
from
1938
to
1951,
they
were
operating
without
any
restrictions
at
all
and
--
and
it
--
and
it
was
the
--
the
relationship
with
their
competitors
during
that
13
year
period
which
was
the
principal
basis
for
the
commission's
conclusion
that
their
proposed
operations
for
the
future
without
restriction
would
not
have
an
undue
restraint
on
competition.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
i
think
that's
a
third
general
statement
of
it.
the
same
as
we
must
take
into
account
at
the
various
provisions
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
in
1938,
the
commission
authorized
motor
transit
to
acquire
this
pipeline
without
any
restrictions
but
subject
to
a
reservation
in
the
commission
of
the
power
to
impose
conditions.
the
commission
did
not
impose
those
conditions
until
following
this
court's
decision
upholding
its
power
to
do
so
in
1951.
that's
the
13-year
period.
may
i
surrender
the
balance
of
my
--
our
time
to
counsel
for
rock
island
motor
transit?
