i

i
understood
you
to
say
here
that
the
commission
did
criticized
--
chief
justice

--
lack
of
sufficiency
of
the

warren
mr.
howland,
you

proceed.
chief
justice
earl

wonder
i

than
to
pursue
a
modification
that
the
longstanding
orders
that
have
--
had
been
made
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl

yes
you
did.
chief
