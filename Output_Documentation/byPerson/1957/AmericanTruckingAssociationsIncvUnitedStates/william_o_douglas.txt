justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
know
(inaudible)
what
my
problem
is
in
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
don't
answer
it
right
this
minute,
but
during
the
course
of
the
argument,
i'd
appreciate
if
you
can
get
around
with
this
--
this
railroad
subsidiary,
this
motor
--
motor
company,
motor
transit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
owned
subsidiary.
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
acquired
--
it
was
acquired
under
a
section
5
proceeding,
was
it
not
by
the
railroad?
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
its
--
its
predecessor
has
acquired
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
now,
at
that
time
--
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
motor
transit
could
not
have
got
under
section
5
on
this
record,
the
rights
of
it
as
now
acquired
under
section
207,
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
problem
is
this.
if
a
--
if
a
motor
carrier's
subsidiary
goes
on
under
section
5
for
the
--
for
the
acquisition
proceedings
subject
to
the
limitation
section,
and
then,
would
the
restricted
operating
permit
moves
under
section
207
and
has
no
restrictions
limiting
by
the
two
--
by
two
bites
of
the
cherry,
it
eliminates
the
restricting
provision
of
section
5,
depletes
section
5.
that
--
that's
the
problem
that
worries
me
about
this.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
an
acquisition
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
are
you
reading
from
that
mr.
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
this
tell
a
definite
burden
of
prove
or
competition?
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
it
got
to
--
can
tell
a
definite
burden
of
proof?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
would?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
