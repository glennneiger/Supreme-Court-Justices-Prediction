mr.
alden
b.
howland
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
lived
more
than
60
years
in
the
city
of
des
monies
which
of
course
is
the
center
of
the
territory
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
territory
involved
extends
generally
between
the
mississippi
river
at
the
cities
of
rock
island,
moline
and
in
east
moline,
illinois
and
davenport,
iowa
across
the
central
part
of
the
state
of
iowa
to
council
bluffs
and
omaha
which
are
on
the
missouri
river.
and
it
is
between
these
points
that
the
certificate
which
is
here
under
review
was
issued
by
the
commission
after
extensive
hearings
in
which
14
days
time
was
consumed
in
hearing
approximately
180
witnesses.
it
is
necessary,
i
think,
that
the
court
have
in
mind
the
character
of
the
territory
involved.
iowa
of
course
is
principally,
an
agricultural
state.
at
the
easterly
end
of
this
territory
are
the
manufacturing
and
distributing
cities
to
which
i
have
referred.
moline
and
rock
island
and
east
moline
are
the
center
of
the
farming
industry.
55
miles
west
of
davenport
is
located
iowa
city
which
has
a
population
of
approximately
20,000.
the
city
of
des
monies
is
located
177
miles
west
of
davenport
and
137
miles
to
the
west
of
des
monies,
we
have
the
cities
of
council
of
bluffs,
iowa
and
omaha,
nebraska.
now,
interspersed
along
u.s.highway
6
between
these
points
are
communities
of
varying
sizes,
of
varying
types,
ranging
in
population,
from
towns
of
a
few
hundred
to
cities
of
12
--
14,000
and
which
are
centers
of
manufacturing
and
commerce.
as
mr.
ginnane
has
pointed
out,
the
white
line
motor
freight
company
was
one
of
the
pioneer
operators
in
interstate
commerce
and
intrastate
commerce
across
the
state
of
iowa
and
it
served
the
chicago,
omaha
area,
having
a
route
on
which
it
operated
with
closed
doors
and
with
no
service
across
the
state
of
illinois
until
it
reached
moline,
east
moline,
and
rock
island.
and
then
it
had
a
distribution
service
across
the
state
of
iowa
from
the
davenport
to
council
bluffs
and
omaha,
nebraska.
it
had
grandfather
rights
under
the
motor
carrier
actof
1935.
in
october
1937,
the
rock
island
railroad
subsidiary
and
the
white
line
motor
freight
company
jointly
applied
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
approval
of
a
transaction
by
which
the
rail
subsidiary
would
acquire
the
operating
authority
and
practically
all
of
the
physical
equipment
incident
to
the
operation
of
the
white
line
truck
route.
the
commission
approved
that
acquisition
but
it
reserves
to
itself
the
prerogative
and
the
reservation
and
restriction
of
imposing
at
some
time
in
the
future.
the
condition
or
restriction
that
it
might
impose
restrictions
to
--
which
would
ensure
that
the
service
rendered
would
be
auxiliary
and
supplemental
to
the
rail
service
of
the
railroad
company.
in
1944,
the
frederickson
route
was
acquired
which
parallel
the
rock
island
rail
line
in
the
westerly
part
of
the
state
of
iowa,
a
much
smaller
operation.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
that
run
from
atlantic
up
through
ireland
and
(inaudible)
to
omaha
and
add
some
intermediate
routes
that
connected
in
to
either
main
lines
or
rail
lines
of
the
rock
island.
it
was
a
much
smaller
operation.
it
was
in
1945,
after
seven
years
of
unrestricted
operation
on
the
white
line
routes
that
the
commission
announced
that
it
was
reopening
both
the
frederickson
acquisition
which
it
had
approved
without
any
restriction
but
as
to
which
no
certificate
had
been
issued.
and
that
it
was
reopening
the
white
line
case
as
well
to
consider
the
question,
as
to
whether
any
restriction
should
be
imposed
at
that
time.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
those
acquisition
cases
were
under
section
213
as
it
was
originally.
of
course,
it
had
become
section
5
(2)
(b)
by
1944
when
the
frederickson
route
was
acquired.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
that's
right.
they
were
both
purchases.
so,
at
that
time,
perhaps
inadvisably,
the
--
the
rock
island
people
challenged
the
power
of
the
commission
to
impose
those
restrictions
at
that
late
date
after
approving
the
acquisitions.
and
when
the
commission
imposed
the
restrictions
which
mr.
ginanne
referred
to,
the
power
of
the
commission
was
challenged
by
an
action
in
united
states
district
court
at
chicago
and
the
lower
court
there
set
aside
the
commission's
action
as
unauthorized.
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
this
tribunal
where
the
power
of
the
commission
to
impose
the
restrictions
was
sustained
by
a
vote
of
five
justices
to
four.
after
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
of
this
court,
in
that
proceeding,
we
went
back
to
the
commission.
we
made
a
showing
that
there
was
a
lack
of
service
along
the
white
line
and
frederickson
routes
by
other
motor
carriers
and
there
was
a
--
affidavits
were
filed
and
a
showing
was
made
to
the
effect
that
during
the
year
1950,
carriers
who
possessed
authority
to
serve
points
on
the
white
line
route
had
turned
over
to
the
rock
island
motor
transit
company
for
delivery
on
that
route
at
various
junction
points,
5500
individual
shipments.
the
commission
first
gave
us
temporary
authority
having
imposed
all
of
the
restrictions,
to
handle
shipments
not
in
excess
of
2000
pounds
and
after
a
hearing
was
held
at
des
monies
in
september
of
1951,
they
raised
that
--
that
weight
limit
to
5000
pounds
and
we've
been
operating
in
the
interim
with
a
5000-pound
weight
limitation
upon
any
one
shipment.
and
the
record
shows
without
any
dispute
here
that
that
works
a
hardship
on
a
great
many
of
the
communities
and
that
there
are
many
shippers
who
need
a
service
for
10,000,
12,000,
15,000-pound
shipments
or
truckload
shipments,
as
the
case
may
be.
now
--
mr.
alden
b.
howland
at
this
hearing,
as
i
said,
we
produced
approximately
180
witnesses.
101
of
them
were
businessmen
engaged
in
various
types
of
business
on
the
white
line
routes.
ten
of
them
were
businessmen
engaged
in
various
business
endeavors
on
the
frederickson
routes.
then
we
produced
representatives
of
chambers
of
commerce
from
chicago,
from
the
tri-cities
of
davenport,
iowa,
rock
island,
moline
and
east
moline,
illinois,
des
monies,
burlington,
iowa,
omaha,
nebraska,
minneapolis,
minnesota
and
others
who
took
the
witness
stand
and
testified
to
the
need
or
a
continuation
of
this
service
which
rock
island
motor
transit
company
had
been
performing
to
this
area
for
a
period
of
13
and
a
half
years
during
the
time
that
the
operation
was
unrestricted.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
we've
filed
it
as
a
section
207
case.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
well,
it
--
we
thought
we
could
prove
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
the
commission
after
an
exhaustive
review
agreed
with
us
on
that
statement.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
yes.
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
statement,
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
not
only
did
we
have
in
this
hearing
the
support
of
shippers
and
receivers
of
freight
at
various
points
that
are
on
this
route,
we
had
the
support
of
connecting
motor
carriers
who
interlined
freight
with
the
rock
island
motor
transit
company
at
chicago,
at
the
tri-city
area,
and
at
other
points
on
the
line.
there
were
some
eight
or
nine
individual
motor
carrier
officers
who
appeared
before
the
examiner
and
testified
to
the
need
for
a
continuation
of
rock
island
motor
transit's
service
to
the
area.
now,
they
testified
that
they
possessed
in
some
instances,
authority
to
serve
these
points
but
that
the
volume
of
business
that
would
be
available
to
them
was
not
sufficient
to
warrant
operation
by
them
over
some
of
the
--
some
segments
of
these
routes
and
they
interchanged
and
interlined
freight
shipments
destined
to
these
points
from
chicago
or
from
eastern
points
with
rock
island
motor
transit
at
the
tri-cities
at
chicago
and
at
another
points
on
the
routes.
so,
some
of
the
motor
carriers
who
are
themselves
members
of
the
a.t.a.organization
appeared
in
support
of
our
application
before
the
commission
and
we
put
on
an
extensive
hearing
in
addition
to
the
witnesses
that
i
have
already
referred
to,
we
introduced
evidence
with
respect
to
the
cost
of
operation,
the
fact
that
this
peddle
service
and
we
showed
the
nature
of
the
operation,
the
cost
of
the
peddle
service
was
greater
than
the
performance
of
point
to
point
service
in
truckload
or
large
quantity
shipments.
and
it
was
upon
this
array
of
evidence
that
the
commission
found
that
the
restriction
that
had
been
imposed
was
unwarranted
and
was
unnecessary
so
far
as
the
protection
of
the
independent
motor
carriers
was
concerned.
now,
the
contention
has
been
made
here
that
the
presence
of
the
rock
island
motor
transit
operation
is
monopolistic
in
character
and
that
it
is
a
threat
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
so-called
independent
motor
carriers.
the
evidence
n
this
case,
i
submit,
if
it
proved
anything
at
all
shows
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
shred
of
foundation
for
such
a
contention.
well,
we
attacked
the
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
the
national
level.
we
showed
by
this
--
the
statistical
information
which
we
introduced
that
in
the
period
between
1946,
when
the
war
came
to
an
end
in
1950
that
there
had
been
a
reduction
of
approximately
60%
in
the
volume
of
less
than
carload
rail
freight.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
the
recess,
i
was
discussing
the
fact
that
there
was
complete
absence
of
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
operations
of
rock
island
motor
transit
company
had
in
anyway
been
harmful
to
the
so-called
independent
motor
carriers.
now,
that
is
demonstrated
in
a
number
of
ways.
first,
it
appears
without
dispute
in
this
record
that
all
of
the
independent
motor
carriers
in
the
area
have
increased
their
traffic
in
the
10
years
or
nine
years
immediately
preceeding
the
hearing
at
a
much
greater
rate
than
have
the
--
then
has
rock
island
motor
transit
company.
the
rock
island
motor
transit
company
has
an
increase
of
roughly
50%
in
its
gross
volume
of
tonnage
handled
during
that
period,
whereas
some
of
the
competitors
who
are
appellants
here
in
this
case
have
increased
the
volume
of
revenues
and
tonnage
handles
by
as
much
300%.
and
we
think
that,
quite
inclusively,
demonstrates
that
there's
no
basis
for
the
claim
that
the
operations
of
rock
island
motor
transit
company
while
they
were
conducted
on
a
nonrestricted
basis
were
predatory
in
nature
or
in
any
manner
that
it
interfered
with
the
logical
development
of
the
motor
carriers.
now,
it
also
appears
in
this
record
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
fact
and
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
during
the
time
since
the
rock
island
motor
transit
acquired
the
white
line
routes
that
rock
island
motor
transit
has
cooperated
with
motor
carriers.
some
of
its
officers
and
employees
have
served
on
the
rate
bureaus.
they
have
participated
in
the
motor
carrier
organizations
and
have
been
highly
regarded
by
the
other
motor
carriers,
some
of
whom
are
appellants
in
this
case.
and
there's
not
syllable
of
evidence
to
the
contrary.
now,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
who
propounded
it
to
mr.
ginnane,
a
question
as
to
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
briefs
that
indicated
the
extent
to
which
the
commission,
in
prior
cases,
had
granted
unrestricted
motor
carrier
authority
to
rail
subsidiaries.
at
pages
17
and
18
of
our
brief,
we
set
forth,
i
believe,
its
12
separate
instances
beginning
with
the
santa
fe
trail
stages
case
and
including
st.
andrews
bay
down
to
the
southern
pacific
control
of
pacific
motor
trucking
purchase
of
lowa
trucking
company
in
which
the
commission
said
that
because
of
the
circumstances
that
were
disclosed
in
the
particular
record
that
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
impose
any
restrictions
upon
the
operations
of
rail
subsidiaries.
now,
as
cited,
there
are
two
cases
in
which
rock
island
motor
transit
itself
was
granted
unrestricted
authority.
one,
being
a
short
route
between
wellman
and
iowa,
city
of
iowa
serving,
i
believe,
two
intermediate
points
and
one
between
clinton
davenport
and
muscatine,
iowa
which
were
rail
routes
--
rail
points
and
as
to
which
in
an
--
in
a
--
an
acquisition
case.
the
--
no
conditions
were
imposed.
we
have
had
other
instances
such
as
the
atlantic
motor
freight
case
which
was
not
reported
in
the
mcc
reports
of
the
commerce
commission
where
no
restriction
--
restrictions
were
imposed.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
well,
frankly,
it
was
the
dealing
of
those
who
were
handling
the
matter,
including
myself,
that
there
would
probably
be
a
greater
degree
of
evidence
admissible
and
a
greater
flexibility
in
the
--
in
the
showing
that
we
wanted
to
make
if
we
proceeded
under
section
207.
and
i
think
as
i
recall
that
there
was
a
suggestion
or
two
from
the
commission
staff
that
we
might
as
well
open
the
whole
thing
up.
and
it
was
upon
that
basis
that
we
filed
an
application
first
in
accordance
with
the
restriction
which
had
been
imposed
to
5000
pounds
maximum
weight
limitation
and
later
we
amended
that
when
we
found
that
through
practical
experience
that
it
was
unworkable
and
it
was
not
serving
the
communities
to
which
the
rock
island
motor
transit
had
the
only
operating
authority.
now,
just
one
for
the
--
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
alden
b.
howland
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
--
that
you
can
circumvent
the
provisions
of
section
5
(2)
(b),
i
think,
that
it's
absolutely
necessary
that
the
commission
make
the
finding
that
is
set
forth
there.
but
i
say
that
the
commission
in
its
discretion
having
made
that
finding,
having
approved
the
acquisition,
the
extent
of
the
limitations
or
restrictions
which
are
to
be
imposed,
if
any,
is
a
matter,
i
believe,
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
commission
and
where
the
evidence
--
mr.
alden
b.
howland
they
made
the
findings
in
1938,
all
findings
required.
and
they
made
additional
findings,
of
course,
in
1954,
when
they
ordered
that
certificate
issue.
the
certificate
has
not
yet
been
issued
to
us.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
well,
my
feeling
is
that
having
once
made
the
requisite
findings
that
are
required
by
5
(2)
(b)
that
the
acquisition
case
is
then
--
if
that's
all
that
is
necessary
but
that
from
then
on
that
the
matter
is
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
commission
under
the
general
powers
and
under
the
statute
itself.
but
they
--
they
made
all
the
requisite
findings
in
1938.
and
as
has
been
pointed
out,
we
operated
for
13
years
without
restrictions
but
with
that
reserved
right
might
--
mr.
alden
b.
howland
my
answer
was
that
it
was
the
feeling
of
counsel
--
mr.
alden
b.
howland
--
including
my
own
that
perhaps
the
--
there
could
be
a
broader
inquiry,
perhaps.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
1954.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
well,
the
acquisition
was
complete
and
the
certificate
was
issued.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
yes.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
that's
right.
mr.
alden
b.
howland
well
--
mr.
alden
b.
howland
well,
they
have
found
upon
additional
evidence
that
under
the
conditions
which
existed
in
1951
and
1952
that
the
removal
of
the
previously
imposed
restriction
of
