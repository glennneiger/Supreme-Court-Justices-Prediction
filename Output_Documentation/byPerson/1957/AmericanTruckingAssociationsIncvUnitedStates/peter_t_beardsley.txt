mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
appeals
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
from
the
district
of
columbia.
that
court
in
turn
upheld
the
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
authorized
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
rock
island
railroad
to
perform
unrestricted
motor
service
between
chicago
on
the
one
hand
and
omaha
on
the
other.
the
court's
decision
is
contained
in
the
record
here
at
192.t
he
commission's
decision
is
pertinent
in
the
record
at
93.
the
appellant's
on
the
case
are
nine
motor
carriers
holding
authority
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
perform
operations
between
points
and
the
territory
of
the
rock
island
railroad.
the
commission's
report
notes
that
of
these
nine,
only
three
of
them
are
the
carriers
with
real
authority
to
serve
the
points
and
we
accept
that
finding.
and
my
discussion
as
far
as
carrier
operations
are
concern
here
will
relate
largely
to
those
three
carriers.
the
names
are
iowa,
nebraska,
(inaudible)
truck
line
inc.and
the
des
moines
transportation
company.
the
other
two
appellants
are
american
trucking
associations
and
its
regular
common
carrier
conference.a.t.a.is
simply
the
trade
association
and
the
motor
carrier
industry
which
in
many
cases
participates
before
the
commission
and
the
courts
in
matters
of
general
interest
to
the
industry.
the
conference
is
simply
a
member
of
the
a.t.a.family
whose
interest
are
devoted
specifically
to
motor
common
carriers
of
general
commodities
operating
over
regular
routes
under
authority
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
appellant's
in
number
8
of
the
railway
labor
executive
association,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
and
the
order
of
railway
conductors
and
brakemen.
the
appellees
here
are
the
commission,
motor
transit,
various
traffic
bureaus,
and
chambers
of
commerce
and
groups,
denominated
shippers
committee
and
employers
committee
of
rock
island
motor
transit.
i'm
a
little
doubtful
as
to
the
government's
status
here,
yet
supported
the
commission
before
the
lower
court
but
has
not
filed
a
brief
before
this
court.
coming
to
the
effect
of
the
commission's
decision
here
as
i
previously
remarked,
the
direct
effect
is
to
authorize
these
completely
unrestricted
motor
operations
between
chicago
and
omaha.
and
right
here,
i
might
touch
on
what
seems
to
be
a
discrepancy
between
the
map
which
we
put
in
the
front
of
our
brief
and
that
which
is
included
in
the
commission's
brief.
the
commission's
brief
stops
on
the
east
at
silvis,
illinois
but
the
commission's
report
makes
it
quite
clear
that
motor
transit
already
posses
authority
between
silvis
on
the
one
hand
and
chicago
with
the
result
that
motor
transit
can
attacked
these
rights
between
silvis
and
chicago
to
the
rights
which
are
granted
in
this
proceeding
and
thereby
render
a
true
service
between
the
two
points
chicago
and
omaha.
now,
the
map
which
we
have
in
our
brief
is
the
map
which
reflects
the
authority
issued
in
the
permanent
certificate
by
the
commission
in
september
of
1951
which
incidentally
motor
transit
has
never
conducted
operations
under.
and
the
circle
points,
the
so-called
quad
cities
over
here
at
rock
island,
moline,
etcetera,
des
moines
and
omaha
are
the
so-called
key
points.
they
are
set
forth
--
all
of
the
restrictions
applicable
to
this
permanent
operation
are
set
forth
in
the
footnote
at
page
7
of
our
brief.
and
with
respect
to
the
key
points,
i'll
just
read
the
item
that
applies
to
that.
"no
shipments
shall
be
transported
by
motor
transit
between
any
of
the
following
points
or
through
or
to
or
from
more
than
one
of
them."
now,
those
are
the
points
that
are
shown
there
in
the
circle
and
as
i
understand
that
rather
gobbledegookish
language,
it
simply
mean
that
motor
transit
under
this
authority
could
originate
a
shipment
in
chicago
for
example,
move
through
the
one
key
point
of
the
quad
cities
and
go
to
any
point
east
of
des
moines
island,
it
could
not
go
into
des
moines.
and
in
the
reverse
direction
it
would
be
roughly
the
same
operation,
that
is
to
say,
going
to
through
from
or
between
one
key
point
but
not
two.
now,
i've
spoken
of
the
direct
effect
of
the
decision.
the
indirect
effect
is
simply
this.
motor
transit
presently
possesses
other
authority
which
could
be
attacked
with
the
authority
granted
here
which
in
turn
will
allow
motor
transit
to
perform
a
completely
unrestricted
service,
for
example,
between
all
of
the
points
shown
on
the
map
in
our
briefs
and
between
cities
on
the
one
hand,
for
example,
in
kansas
city
and
the
other.
in
addition,
by
interchange,
a
lot
of
motor
carriers,
motor
transit
could
perform
service
between
practically
any
point
in
the
country.
that's
the
effect
of
the
commission's
decision,
route
wise,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
now,
as
to
the
rate
wise
effect.
it
simply
means
that
the
independent
motor
carriers
will
face
the
competition
first
in
the
railroad,
next
of
motor
transit
at
rate
levels
which
are
identical
with
that
of
the
independent
motor
carriers.
and
finally,
thirdly,
the
competition
of
truck
service
by
motor
transit
in
a
movement
of
railroad
bill
freight
and
i
might
say
this
that
with
particularly
with
respect
to
low
--
small
shipments
or
relatively
small
shipments
where
there
is
any
discrepancy
in
the
rates
of
motor
carriers
and
railroads,
the
rates
of
the
railroads
are
usually
lower.
coming
now
to
the
questions
which
are
presented
here,
the
first
one
as
we
see
it
as
well
as
the
evidence
supports
the
commission's
order.
we
say
it
done
and
we
agree
with
commissioner
(inaudible)
in
dissenting
who
has
said
that
the
majority
was
simply
overwhelmed
by
the
quantity
of
the
evidence
here.
to
put
it
in
the
vernacular,
the
commission
was
a
victim
of
a
snow
job.
second,
whether
in
any
event
the
commission
has
discretion
to
authorize
the
railroads
to
perform
motor
carrier
operations
which
are
completely
devoid
from
their
train
service
in
all
out
competitions
with
independent
motor
carrier.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
that
the
condition
and
incidentally,
that's
an
entirely
new
thing
after
so
many
years
of
operation.
that
is
to
say
the
standard
that
the
commission
use
in
there
is
public
convenience
and
necessity.
it
never
--
it
has
not
impose
in
this
case,
any
so-called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
designed
to
--
to
limit
the
railroad
to
--
anything
beyond
a
complete,
all
out
motor
carrier
service
as
it
has
done
in
every
important
case
prior
to
this
one.
and
i
don't
--
we
don't
--
we
contend
that
that
reservation
is
imposed
in
this
case
as
in
the
--
one
of
--
one
of
the
dissenting
commissioners
here,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
the
commission
says
that
it
reserves
a
right
in
the
future
to
impose
any
conditions
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
not
by
the
proviso
of
section
5
(2)
(b),
which
we
contend
as
a
part
of
the
statute
that
applies
here.
and
the
--
on
the
second
question,
we
agreed
with
commissioner
(inaudible)
in
his
dissent
to
--
when
he
said
that
the
commission
simply
lacks
the
power
to
do
what
it
has
done
in
this
case.
the
third
question
as
we
see
it
is
simply
whether
the
commission
after
authorizing
the
purchase
of
restricted
rights
by
a
rail
affiliate
under
section
5,
as
was
the
case
here,
they
subsequently
void
those
restrictions
by
a
grant
of
similar
authority
under
section
207
without
imposing
any
so-called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restrictions
as
required
by
the
proviso
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
of
the
act.
here
we
agree
with
the
railroad
labor
unions
that
the
commission
lacks
that
power
and
leave
it
to
their
counsel
to
discuss
that
one
question.
this
case
itself
is
simply
another
phase
of
a
proceeding
that
began
way
back
in
1937,
when
motor
transit
filed
an
application
to
purchase
a
so-called
white
line
right
between
silvis,
illinois
and
omaha.
the
commission
approved
that
purchase
in
1941
and
it
reserved
the
right
to
impose
auxiliary
and
supplemental
restriction
designed
to
limit
the
operations
to
a
coordinated
rail
motor
service.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
dwell
on
the
history
between
1937
and
1950
because
this
court
said
it
forth
very
fully
and
very
clearly
in
its
rock
island
opinion
at
340
u.s.419.
in
any
event,
we
have
covered
it
at
pages
4
to
9
of
our
brief
and
i
think
if
i
may,
i'll
just
leave
it
there.
six
months
after
the
court's
rock
island
decision,
the
commission
issued
this
restricted
certificate,
which
i
call
the
court's
attention.
and
as
i
said
before
motor
transit
has
never
conducted
any
operation
pursuant
to
that
certificate
instead
it
has
been
operating
under
a
so-called
temporary
authority
since
august
30th,
1951
which
incidentally,
is
much
less
restricted
in
a
permanent
certificate
shown
in
our
brief.
in
october
1951,
motor
transit
filed
an
application
for
unrestricted
authority
under
section
207
and
hearing
were
held
in
1952.
and
after
the
usual
routine
of
proceedings
before
the
commission,
it
issued
the
report
an
order
which
we're
complaining
of
in
this
case.
coming
now
to
matters
of
substance
if
i
may
and
dealing
first
with
the
congressional
policy
which
we
think
is
involved
in
this
case.
certainly,
long
prior
to
the
time
congress
regulated
the
interstate
transportation
by
motor
carrier.
it
has
recognized
the
tendency
of
railroads
to
monopolize
transport
whenever
they
were
given
the
opportunity
and
it
had
taken
steps
to
prevent
domination
by
other
forms
of
transport
by
the
railroad.
for
example,
i
--
they
only
refer
to
the
panama
canal
act
of
1912
and
to
the
policy
set
forth
by
congress
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920
to
promote,
encourage,
and
develop
water
transportation
service
and
facilities.
we've
dealt
with
that
in
more
detail
and
i
will
here
at
pages
14
to
16
of
our
brief.
so
that,
when
congress
came
to
regulate
interstate
transportation
by
motor
carriers
by
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935,
it
did
several
things.
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
imposed
in
section
202
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
a
duty
on
the
commission
among
other
things
to
recognize
and
preserve
the
inherited
advantages
of
motor
transportation.
but
it
did
more
than
and
of
course
that
language
is
now
embraced
in
the
national
transportation
policy.
in
--
in
the
section
213
of
the
motor
carrier
act
which
covers
acquisition,
purchases,
mergers,
consolidation,
etcetera,
the
congress
set
forth
the
criterion
by
which
the
commission
was
to
be
governed
in
what
i
call
ordinary
cases
when
one
--
one
motor
carrier
wants
to
purchase
another
motor
carrier.
and
it
said
that
the
commission
shall
approve
the
transaction
if
it
finds
that
it
will
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
now,
that
same
standard
of
course
applies
to
a
railroad
purchase
of
a
motor
carrier
but
two
additional
standards
were
put
in
that
proviso
of
section
213
to
cover
cases
in
which
railroad
seek
to
acquire
motor
carriers.
congress
told
the
commission
that
it
shall
not
approve
the
transaction
unless
it
finds
that
it
will
enable
the
railroad
to
use
service
by
motor
vehicle
to
public
advantage
in
its
operations.
i
stress
those
last
three
words
because
i
believe
they
maybe
the
only
thing
about
which
there
is
really
no
dispute
in
this
case.
namely,
that
in
its
operations
restricts
rail
operation
of
motor
vehicles
to
in
any
event
something
less
than
an
all
out
independent
motor
carrier
service,
what
i
would
call
a
"coordinated
rail
motor
service"
designed
simply
to
improve
the
ultimate
rail
service.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
i
assume
the
commission
can
always
open
up
a
docket
but
we
argue
on
brief
that
that
reservation
first
of
all
is
imposed
to
really
enable
the
commission
to
later
on
open
up
its
docket
and
take
away
from
motor
transit
what
it
would
convey
here.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
--
i
don't
want
to
dive
into
the
question
but
i
would
--
i
would
say
this
that
certainly,
our
people
would
always
be
willing
to
petition
the
commission.
but
i
think
that
in
all
fairness
and
in
all
candor,
if
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
commission's
report
here
indicates
that
they
have
very
little
chance
of
any
success
in
such
a
case.
we
also,
point
out
on
our
brief
that
a
--
that
an
exercise
of
this
power
which
the
commission
purportedly
reserves
here
would
really
amount
to
a
revocation
of
the
authority
under
section
212
of
the
motor
carrier
act
and
the
commission
cannot
do
that.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
yes,
sir.
now,
have
i
fully
answered
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
now,
the
second
--
i
might
say
first
of
all
of
course
that
with
respect
to
enabling
the
railroad
to
use
a
truck
service
in
its
operations
the
commission
couldn't
and
didn't
make
any
such
finding
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i'm
sorry,
sir.
it's
now
contained
in
section
5
--
in
the
proviso
section
5
(2)
(b).
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
49
u.s.code
section
5
(2)
(b).
the
second
additional
criteria
that
the
congress
placed
in
the
law
with
respect
to
railroad
acquisition
of
a
motor
carrier
is
this,
"that
the
commission
shall
not
approve
the
transaction
unless
it
finds
that
it
will
not
unduly
restrain
competition."
and
as
to
this
requirement,
the
commission
report
says
here,
"the
operations
of
motor
transit
have
not
unduly
restrained
competition
and
there's
no
evidence
that
it
proposed
operations
would
produce
such
a
result."
we
deal
with
these
findings
on
brief
at
page
63
and
i
won't
say
anything
more
here
about
that
except
to
point
out
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
would
seem
to
place
the
burden
on
the
protestants
to
have
introduced
evidence
in
this
case
showing
that
motor
transit's
operations
in
the
future,
contrary
to
the
past
experience
will
not
restrain
competition.
now,
we
say
that
the
burden
in
this
case
was
on
motor
transit
to
satisfy
every
provision
of
the
statutes
and
it
by
not
introducing
evidence
and
the
commission
not
finding
any
fault
with
that
they
have
in
effect
transferred
the
verdict
to
satisfy
that
any
monopoly
requirement
from
the
applicant,
motor
transit,
to
the
protestants
in
the
case.
coming
now
to
the
commission's
construction
of
this
proviso
of
section
5
(2)
(b),
i
think
that
the
district
court
has
set
it
forth
very
tersely
and
very
accurately
at
193-194
of
the
record
here.
and
if
i
might,
i
would
just
like
to
read
what
the
court
said.
the
commission
says
the
requirement
is
notably
omitted
from
the
terms
of
section
207
(a)
that
the
policy,
not
the
terms
of
the
requirement
applies
to
the
issuance
of
certificate
under
section
207
(a).
it
says
a
policy
requirement
is
not
so
rigid
as
a
flat
requirement
in
terms
but
is
flexible
and
permits
a
grant
in
exceptional
circumstances
were
the
commission
finds
that
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
require
the
grant.
and
of
course
the
court
agreed
with
the
commission's
theory
of
law
and
we
would
respectfully
submit
erred
in
so
doing
it.
let
me,
if
i
may
try
to
find
the
flaw
in
that
theory.
first
of
all,
it
imputes
an
intention
by
congress
to
require
the
commission
to
read
the
language
of
the
proviso
of
5
(2)
(b)
into
applications
filed
by
railroads
or
railroad
affiliates
under
section
207.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
307
united
states
code.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
49
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
it's
printed
at
page
84
of
the
--
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
it's
section
207
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
307
u.s.code.
now,
as
i
said
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
with
respect
to
this
theory
of
the
commission,
it
imputes
an
intention
of
congress
to
require
the
commission
to
read
the
language
of
5
(2)
(b)
in
the
207
except
in
cases
involving
exceptional
circumstances.
now,
we
submit
first
of
all,
that's
a
rather
subtle
distinction.
second
of
all,
since
obviously,
congress
didn't
use
any
words
like
exceptional
circumstances
in
the
law,
it
couldn't
define
it.
and
so,
it
remains
under
the
commission's
theory
for
it
to
define
what
i
meant
by
exceptional
circumstances.
now,
the
exceptional
circumstances
set
forth
in
this
case
is
the
alleged
fare
of
independent
motor
carriers
to
provide
an
adequate
service
to
smaller
points
and
the
commission
says
out
of
what
we
think
is
completely
unless
they
got
any
sympathy
for
the
railroad's
subsidiary,
we
will
allow
it
to
serve
the
major
points.
what
--
what
will
the
exceptional
circumstances
be
tomorrow
if
the
commission
has
complete
discretions
to
determine
what
they
are?
they
will
be
almost
anything
which
the
commission
decides
to
apply
that
term
to.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
short
answer
to
that
argument
is
this.
congress
obviously
was
concerned
with
restraint
of
competition
or
it
wouldn't
have
included
this
language
of
5
(2)
(b)
in
the
act.
and
if
it
had
intended
to
confer
on
the
commission
the
authority
to
just
simply
make
wholesale
exceptions
to
the
policy
expressed
in
5
(2)
(b).
surely,
it
could
have
found
a
few
simple
words
to
add
to
the
statute
to
make
that
intent
clear
beyond
deferred
venture.
i
might
say
additionally,
with
respect
to
the
commission's
theory
is
completely
contrary
to
the
position
which
it
took
before
this
court
in
1950,
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case.
that
case
too,
like
this
case
dealt
with
the
207
application.
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
what
the
commission
said
in
that
case.
i
will
refer
the
court
to
what
it
said
at
pages
25
and
26
of
our
brief
where
you'll
find
at
set
forth
in
the
blackest
print
we
could
find.
and
as
i
said
before,
it's
completely
to
the
contrary
of
what
it
said
then
and
you
will
find
a
good
bit
more
of
that
black
print
throughout
our
brief
here.
because
with
respect
to
every
important
aspect
of
this
case,
what
the
commission
tells
the
court
now
is
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
it
told
the
court
in
1950.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
when
a
railroad
makes
an
application
under
section
207
to
provide
motor
carrier
service
we
contend
that
the
language
of
the
proviso
section
5
(2)
(b)
must
be
read
into
that
section
207
by
the
commission.
and
i
will
deal
with
that
in
a
little
bit
more
detail
on
the
legislative
history,
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
is
our
contention.
oh,
i
--
i
should
have
told
the
court
here
when
i
was
remarking
about
the
difference
between
the
commission's
approach
now
and
what
it
was
in
1950,
i
should
have
referred
the
court
to
the
page
23
of
their
brief
in
this
case
first
and
i
didn't.
there,
the
commission
draws
the
--
a
distinction.
it
says
that
when
a
railroad
purchases
a
motor
carrier,
the
effect
of
the
purchase
is
to
remove
that
previously
independent
motor
carrier
from
the
field,
therefore,
that's
bad
for
competition.
it
says
however,
when
a
railroad
institutes
its
own
service
under
section
207,
that
adds
a
new
competitor
to
the
field,
ergo,
that's
good
for
competition.
now,
as
i
previously
said,
that
is
diametrically
opposed
to
what
it
told
this
court
in
its
brief
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case
in
1950.
the
final
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
here
with
respect
to
the
policy
aspect
of
the
case
is
this.
at
page
14
of
its
brief
the
commission
says,
it
comes
up
with
this
remarkable
statement
at
least
to
us.
it
says
the
court
has
already
recognized
that
the
proviso
of
section
5
(2)
(b)
among
other
things
does
not
preclude
the
commission
from
authorizing
ordinary
and
unrestricted
motor
carrier
service
by
a
railroad
to
points
on
--
on
the
other
railroad
and
i
stress
this
language.
"to
satisfy
a
public
need
for
transportation
service
which
other
carriers
are
not
providing."
that
statement
is
remarkable
for
two
reasons.
the
first
one
is
it
just
evades
the
question
here.
if
the
commission
report
in
this
case
had
confined
the
authority
granted
to
points
at
which
there
was
a
need
for
service
and
have
not
gone
way
off
the
line
and
authorized
service
to
points
as
to
which
there
isn't
a
question
in
the
--
in
the
record
that
there
is
already
plenty
of
adequate
service,
i
doubt
it
we'd
be
here
today.
the
commission
does
have
a
statement
in
its
report,
record
115
here,
that
the
evidence
respecting
a
need
for
truck
load
service
"is
not
as
convincing
as
that
with
respect
to
the
peddle
operations."
now,
we
submit
that
simply
is
the
understatement
of
the
decade.
every
witness
presented
by
motor
transit
in
this
case
and
they
presented
a
literal
horde
of
them,
almost
108.
when
they
were
asked
on
cross-examination
if
there
was
any
need
for
additional
services
to
the
major
points,
they
said
there
wasn't.
that's
particularly
true,
for
example
of
judge
reed,
the
chairman
of
the
iowa
state
commerce
commission.
he
made
no
bones
about
it.
and
his
testimony
on
that
phase
of
the
case
is
at
the
record
744
and
745.
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
the
commission
seriously
contends
in
this
case
that's
there's
a
need
for
additional
motor
service
at
points
such
as
omaha,
des
moines,
chicago,
cedar
rapids,
and
such
as
that.
rather,
what
he
has
done
here
is
to
authorize
motor
transit
to
provide
service
at
these
large
points
because
it
says,
to
do
otherwise
wouldn't
do
justice
to
the
railroads'
subsidiary.
but
i
talked
about
the
contention
of
the
commission
being
somewhat
remarkable
and
as
i
said
the
first
reason
is,
that
it
begs
the
question.
but
the
second
and
even
more
remarkable
aspect
of
the
commission
statement
is
that
it's
exactly
contrary
to
what
this
court
had
to
say
on
the
rock
island
case
at
340
u.s.443-44.
where
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
announced
transportation
policy
of
congress
didn't
permit
railroads
to
perform
unrestricted
motor
service.
now,
that's
what
they
suggested,
that
rock
island
unlike
this
case
was
affected
(inaudible).
i'll
simply
refer
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
t&p
case
again
which
was
a
section
207
case
such
as
this.
and
where
the
court
at
340
u.s.459
held
that
the
same
considerations
justifies
similar
treatment
to
railroad
motor
carrier
operations
while
the
applications
to
perform
that
service
is
filed
under
section
5
or
under
section
207.
i
now
like
to
deal,
rather
likely
if
i
may
with
the
legislative
history
and
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
21
to
26
in
some
detail.
as
the
court
might
expect,
there
is
a
considerable
disparity
between
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
legislative
history
which
is
applicable
here
in
our
interpretation.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no,
sir.
we
think
it
proves
a
good
deal
but
like
most
litigants
before
the
court,
we
think
it
prove
our
side
of
the
story
and
not
theirs.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
i
can
fairly
say
that
we
draw
different
inferences
from
the
same
legislative
material
--
materials.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
it's
very
frequently
mind,
but
i'm
optimistic
enough
to
hope
that
the
court
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
--
won't
be
left
in
doubt.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
of
course.
we
rely
principally
here,
of
course,
on
the
rock
island
and
the
texas
and
pacific
cases
which
this
court
decided
earlier
in
1951.
and
at
that
time,
you
had
before
you
precisely
the
same
legislative
history
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs
here.
i
might
touch
on,
first
the
so-called
shipstead
amendment.
in
1938,
a
bill
was
introduced
which
proposed
various
amendments
to
the
motor
carrier
act.
at
that
time
senator
shipstead
also
proposed
to
physically
place
in
section
207
of
the
act,
the
precise
language
of
the
proviso
of
section
5
(2)
(b).
now,
the
senator
subsequently
withdrew
that
amendment
and
the
commission
tells
us
in
its
brief
that
it
was
withdrawn
only
because
it
was
controversial,
not
because
it
wasn't
necessary
if
indeed
this
proviso
was
to
be
read
under
section
207.
the
commission
says
that
at
page
35
of
its
brief.
and
it
doesn't
quote
at
any
great
length
from
--
from
what
senator
shipstead
had
to
say
at
the
time
he
withdrew
his
amendment.
we
quote
at
greater
length
at
page
24
of
our
brief
and
we
think
that
the
colloquy
there
in
which
senator
shipstead
engaged
with
senator
johnson
is
a
clear
indication
that
the
real
reason
his
amendment
was
withdrawn
was
simply
this.
commissioner
eastman
had
previously
appeared
before
the
committee
and
had
indicated
that
in
its
administration
of
the
law,
the
commission
would
in
any
event
read
the
proviso
of
5
(2)
(b)
into
section
207
whenever
a
railroad
filed
an
application
to
perform
motor
service
under
that
latter
section.
coming
now
to
the
final
leg
of
this
--
of
this
portion
of
the
argument
if
i
may,
of
course,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
a
question
in
anybody's
mind
of
what
the
so-called
kansas
city
southern
decision
of
the
commission
is
its
landmark
decision
in
this
field.
that
was
the
first
really
important
case
it
had
dealing
with
the
section
207
application.
and
it
decided
in
that
case
that
it
would
impose
the
same
restrictions
in
a
railroad's
--
in
a
certificate
issued
to
a
railroad
to
operate
motor
vehicles
as
it
had
previouslyimposed
in
the
so-called
barker
case
which
unlike
the
kansas
city
southern
case
arose
under
section
5,
where
this
language
of
the
proviso
was
directly
applicable.
but
as
to
the
kansas
city
southern
case
there
were
two
of
them.
the
first
one
is
reported
in
10
m.c.c.221
and
was
a
decision
by
division,
5
of
the
commission.
the
second
and
subsequent
kansas
city
southern
case
was
the
decision
of
the
entire
commission.
and
the
only
difference
between
the
two
case
is
that
in
the
second
case,
the
commission
substituted
for
a
so-called
prior
or
subsequent
rail
haul
restriction
which
it
had
previously
used
up
to
that
time,
the
so-called
key
point
requirement
which
is
set
forth
in
the
permanent
certificate
which
is
shown
in
the
front
of
our
brief
here.
but
the
commission
has
relied
so
heavily
on
the
st.andrews
bay
case
and
the
purpose
is
obvious.
they
are
seeking
something,
anything
as
an
offset
to
the
kansas
city
southern
case.
they
cited
the
st.andrews
bay
case
six
times
in
their
brief
and
i
think
its
worth
a
little
bit
of
my
time.
and
the
first
thing
i'd
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
it
is
a
decision
of
the
commission's
division
5
and
not
of
the
entire
commission,
as
well
as
the
second
kansas
city
southern
case
and
indeed
the
st.
andrews
bay
case
may
have
been
--
maybe
considered
to
have
been
reversed
subnormally
by
the
kansas
city
southern
decision.
second,
it's
considerably
dissimilar,
factually
from
this
case,
it
involved
operations
only
between
those
in
alabama
and
columbus,
georgia,
points
about
120
miles
apart.
third,
we
think
its
significance
to
a
large
extent
may
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
apparently
forgotten
by
1950
when
it
filed
a
brief
with
this
court
in
1950
in
the
t&p
case
in
which
it
included
an
appendix
containing
more
than
140
previous
decisions
in
which
it
had
limited
railroad
service
to
auxiliary
and
supplemental
operating,
it
didn't
even
cite
the
st.
andrews
bay
case.
fourth,
perhaps
this
is
significant
and
we
think
so.
we
were
just
curious
to
see
the
significance
of
the
st.andrews
bay
case
so
far
as
the
agency
which
offered
it
is
concerned.
now,
we
write
it
down
in
(inaudible),
it
cited
three
times
in
the
(inaudible),
in
the
motor
carrier
volumes
of
the
commission,
the
last
citation
--
excuse
me.
the
last
citation
in
1942
is
never
been
cited
in
a
decision
of
the
entire
commission
even.
contrary
as
to
that,
kansas
city
southern
case
is
cited
65
times.
and
so,
what
the
commission
has
done
here
as
we
see
it
is
to
drag
this
poor
old
skeleton
of
the
st.
andrews
bay
case
out
of
its
closet
of
long
forgotten
proceedings
and
it
has
used
it
at
the
major
premise.
it
has
added
that
its
minor
premise
and
incorrect
conclusion
respecting
the
reason
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
shipstead
amendment
in
1938.
and
by
putting
those
two
things
together,
it
has
come
to
the
syllogism
which
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
language
in
the
rock
island
case
where
you
pointed
out
at
340
u.s.432
that
when
congress
reenacted
section
213
of
the
motor
carrier
act
into
section
5
(2)
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
it
was
specifically
aware
of
the
commission's
practice
of
limiting
railroads
to
the
performance
of
auxiliary
and
supplemental
motor
operations.
what
the
commission
tells
the
court
here
today
is
it
when
congress
moved
that
first
section
into
the
second
section
of
the
law
that
it
was
specifically
aware
that
he
commission
wasn't
limiting
motor
operations
of
railroads
under
section
207.
coming
to
the
final
leg
of
this
verbal
journey,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
factual
matters
involved
in
this
case.
and
about
the
criticism
of
the
commission
which
is
contained
in
the
report
here
with
respect
to
the
operation
it
provided
by
these
relatively
small
motor
carriers
between
the
iowa
points.
they
are
criticized
first
because
they
don't
provide
as
much
peddle
service
as
motor
transit.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i'm
coming
--
yes,
sir.
peddle
service
is
simply
the
business
of
taking
a
truck
starting
it
out
empty
for
example,
moving
down
the
highway
particularly
were
you
have
a
lot
of
small
communities,
as
you
have
in
this
case
which
are
contiguous
to
each
other
and
which
individually
don't
generate
a
whole
lot
of
freight.
and
picking
up
at
one
town,
say
250
pound
shipment
and
moving
on
to
the
next
center
until
eventually
you
have
a
truck
full
of
freight.
and
then
you
deposit
that
truck,
you
may
take
it
on
to
other
points
and
dump
it.
it's
--
it's
that
kind
of
operation,
they
so-called
door-to-door
movement
or
a
town-to-town
movement.
and
as
i
say,
the
court
is
critical
of
the
failure
of
the
independent
motor
carriers
here
to
provide
as
extensive
a
peddle
operation
as
motor
transit.
and
it
comes
to
this
conclusion
at
record
115.
it
says
it
would
be
unfair
to
restrict
motor
transit's
operations
in
this
case
to
so-called
auxiliary
and
supplemental
service,
to
use
its
words,
and
hand-over
the
truck
load
cream
of
the
traffic
to
motor
transit's
competitors.
we
submit
with
deference
that
the
criticism
is
unfounded
and
the
conclusion
is
unwarranted.
and
we
think
that
the
commission
fell
into
error
here
by
its
failure
to
perform
the
duty
which
the
court
ascribed
to
it
in
the
barker
case
of
guarding
against
the
danger
of
the
development
of
a
transportation
monopoly.
the
commission
we
believe
in
all
candor
has
simply
abandoned
its
duty
and
because
of
that
abandonment
it's
unwilling
to
disturb
the
status
quo
which
now
exists
in
this
iowa
area
and
which
has
existed
since
1937
when
the
rock
island
railroad
decided
to
parallel
its
lines
with
unrestricted
motor
service.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
said
and
--
and
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that,
we
don't
believe
there's
any
serious
question
in
the
record
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
motor
carrier
service
to
the
larger
points
involved
here.
and
that
the
commission
in
effect
has
overcome
that
failure
to
prove
any
need
for
services,
the
larger
points
by
simply
a
gift
to
motor
transit
of
this
additional
service
based
on
what
i
concede
to
be
the
commission's
misbegotten
sympathy
for
motor
transit
because
they
are
serving
these
small
points.
the
commission
says
in
effect,
"well,
they're
providing
good
service
to
these
small
points
and
we're
not
going
to
make
them
provide
that
costly
service
and
at
the
same
time
not
let
them
serve
chicago,
omaha,
etcetera,
even
though
there
really
isn't
any
need
for
service
at
those
--
at
those
points."
now,
does
that
answer
the
question
mr.
chief
justice
warren?
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
the
fallacy
in
the
commission's
logic?
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
as
we
see
it,
it's
this
mr.
justice
black.
the
railroad
already
provides
its
service
to
the
large
points.
it
isn't
suffering
one
bit.
it's
doing
very
well.
it
has
used
its
creature,
motor
transit,
to
substitute
the
more
efficient
truck
service
for
the
way
train
and
peddle
power
operations
which
the
railroad
previously
performed
rather
cumbersomely
by
using
motor
transit
to
prolong
that
service
to
these
small
points.
a
railroad
is
improving
the
efficiency
of
its
overall
service
and
it's
doing
it
a
lot
more
economically
than
it
could
have
done
with
its
railroad
cost.
and
because
it's
doing
it
more
efficiently
it
is
able
to
re-train
traffic
in
the
family,
so
to
speak,
which
it
would,
otherwise
have
lost.
and
so
there
is
no
reason
for
sympathy
for
this
poor
little
rail
motor
combined.
the
commission's
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no.
i
don't
say
that,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
let
me
--
let
me
point
out
first
of
all
what
--
what
i
haven't
pointed
out
so
far.
motor
transit
has
a
monopoly
conferred
upon
it
as
far
as
intrastate
service
is
concerned
by
the
iowa
state
commerce
commission.
and
this
peddle
service
is
performed
by
motor
transit,
is
simply
a
burden
that
goes
with
the
monopoly
that
it
has.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
it
is
a
useful
service.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
there
--
there
shouldn't
be
any
fair
criticism
of
independent
motor
carriers
for
not
providing
a
service
which
the
--
the
--
which
is
simply
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
which
they
can't
provide
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
can't
get
into
this
territory
in
intrastate
operations.
that
is
the
backbone
of
the
service
in
this
area.
independent
motor
carriers
can't
do
that.
rock
island
has
the
only
rights.
and
rock
island
combines
those
intrastate
state
rights
with
their
interstate
operations.
and
when
you
get
to
the
peddle
service
that's
really
the
burden
of
that
intrastate
monopoly.
they've
got
the
monopoly.
they've
got
to
provide
the
service.
now,
what
in
effect
they're
doing
is
coming
to
the
commission
and
saying,
"yes,
we
have
a
monopoly
and
we
have
to
provide
this
service
in
intrastate
commerce
but
it's
expensive.
and
let
us
make
up
for
that
by
serving
these
larger
points."
and
that
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
don't
think
anything
would
happen
to
it.
i
--
i
suspect
that
rock
island
will
say
that,
"well,
they
simply
go
out
and
abandon
it."
i
believe
that,
if
i
may
put
it
this
way,
simply
a
colossal
bluff.
the
commission's
report
points
out
that
this
iowa
area
here
is
the
very
heart
of
the
railroad's
operations
and
certainly
they
are
not
going
away
and
abandon
the
very
heart
of
their
operations
and
try
to
make
it
appear
that
they
will
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
factor
in
--
although
it's
not
just
disposed
here
in
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
--
the
court.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
but
that
argument
overlooks
what
to
us
is
the
--
and
what
the
commission
has
really
overlooked
in
this
case.
namely,
that
you
cannot
view
motor
transit
as
a
separate
entity,
it
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
rock
island
family.
now,
the
commission
expressed
concern
about
the
financial
welfare
of
motor
transit
and
it
talked
about
this
cream
of
the
traffic.
the
railroad
gets
its
cream
and
its
carload
tonnage.
the
commission
for
example,
in
this
report
shed
a
few
tears
for
the
fact
that
the
railroad's
less
carload
tonnage
had
consistently
declined
over
a
five
year
period.
now,
if
--
it
--
it
struck
us,
it's
rather
strange
for
example
if
the
commission
wasn't
equally
concern
with
the
railroad's
carload
tonnage.
less
carload
tonnage
represents
one
half
of
1%
of
total
tonnage
transported
by
railroads
and
represents
less
than
3%
of
the
revenue
derived
from
their
total
transportation.
now,
why
didn't
the
commission
inquire
as
to
the
welfare
of
the
railroad
with
respect
to
carload
tonnage?
if
it
had
made
that
kind
of
an
inquiry
it
would
have
found
that
the
railroad's
carload
tonnage
had
increased
from
24
to
42
and
a
half
million
tons
in
a
period
between
1940
and
1952.
it
would
have
found
that
the
railroad
revenue
accruing
from
that
transportation
grows
from
$65
to
$180
million
in
that
same
period.
and
so,
what
we're
really
saying
here
is
that
the
--
the
commission
has
gone
into
the
financial
welfare,
so
to
speak,
of
motor
transit
just
as
though
it
were
an
entirely
separate
entity
required
to
stand
on
its
own
two
feet.
it
has
overlooked
the
obvious
fact
that
motor
transit
is
supported,
subsidized,
if
you
please,
in
every
conceivable
manner
by
its
parent
railroad.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
obvious.
motor
transit
performs
operations
much
more
efficiently
and
much
more
economically
than
the
parent
railroad
could.
but
by
looking
at
motor
transit
as
--
as
an
operation
which
has
to
stand,
as
i
say
on
its
own
two
feet
the
commission
has
in
effect
missed
the
boat.
there
is
no
occasion
here
for
the
commission
to
be
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
the
railroad.
i
pointed
out
those
figures
a
moment
ago.
and
certainly,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
financial
welfare
of
the
railroad,
why
does
it
have
to
be
concern
with
the
financial
welfare
of
the
railroad's
creature?
we
fail
to
understand
it.
i
did
want
to
touch
on
one
more
point
while
i
was
on
this
face
of
the
case.
i
believe
to
begin
with
and
i
think
the
record,
a
fair
reading
the
record
shows
that
the
criticism
of
the
motor
carriers
the
(inaudible)
of
a
one
serving
the
iowa
points
is
extremely
unfair.
and
i
earnestly
call
to
the
court's
attention
exhibit
31,
32,
and
33
in
this
case.
i'm
so
earnest
about
it
frankly
because
we
didn't
cover
it
on
our
brief.
those
exhibits
show,
the
operations
of
iowa
and
nebraska
for
a
period,
i
believe
it
was
september
27,
1951
to
april
15th,
1952.
the
reason
we
went
into
them
was
because
motor
transit
brief
here
at
page
20
says
for
example,
that
it
--
it
has
exclusive
--
exclusive
authority
to
serve
11
towns
between
des
moines
and
davenport.
so,
we
got
curious.
we
checked
the
exhibits.
we
found
first
of
all
that
that
just
wasn't
so.
exhibit
show
iowa
and
nebraska
is
having
delivered
freight
to
at
least
five
of
those
points.
but
that
isn't
so
important.
i
recognized
that
that's
not
significant
just
as
one
of
the
parties
to
the
case
made
a
mistake
in
its
brief.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
significance
of
the
figures
that
are
developed
by
looking
at
those
exhibits
are
these.
we
found
a
total
of
149
shipments,
we
analyzed
them.
the
largest
one
of
those
shipments
weighed
less
than
6500
pounds.
the
smallest
shipment
weighed
22
pounds.
only
five
of
the
shipments
were
of
a
total
of
more
than
2000
pounds,
truckload
cream
of
the
traffic
indeed.
that's
the
kind
of
traffic
that
this
little
small
operator
is
actually
handling
in
this
territory
and
we
think
the
commission
was
extremely
unfair.
in
effect,
characterizing
this
carrier
and
the
other
two,
as
in
effect
saying
that
they're
shirking
their
duty,
all
they're
interested
in
is
the
truckload
cream
of
the
traffic.
the
facts
of
records
simply
don't
show
that.
now,
another
thing
that
the
commission
apparently
overlooked
in
criticizing
these
carriers
for
the
failure
to
render
more
service
than
they
render
is
this,
and
we
think
it's
extremely
significant.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir,
exactly.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
if
the
commission
had
properly
construed
the
facts
of
record,
it
wouldn't
have
had
this
misbegotten
sympathy
for
motor
transit
and
it
wouldn't
have
any
occasion
to
reach
out
in
any
effect
rewrite
the
statute
here.
particularly,
when
congress
hasn't
seen
any
need
to
do
it.
and,
as
i
say
the
second
factor
that
the
commission
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
they
have
in
this
--
you
--
you
will
see
when
you
read
our
brief,
that
the
commission
in
fact,
in
its
annual
reports
in
several
years
has
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
fact
that
it
is
not
allowing
railroads
to
--
to
perform
anything
beyond
an
auxiliary
and
supplemental
operations.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
we
--
at
page
39
of
our
brief
under
the
heading,
the
commission
recognized
as
did
the
railroads
that
there
was
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
we
point
out
as
in
the
commission's
65th
annual
report,
it
said
this,
if
i
may
read
briefly.
some
urge
that
the
railroads
in
order
to
improve
service
and
reduce
cost
should
make
greater
use
of
motor
transportation
in
conjunction
with
their
rail
operations.
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
are
criticized
as
placing
undue
restrictions
on
such
use
by
not
permitting
all
motor
operations.
this
problem
has
been
given
thorough
consideration
that
the
commission
cites
the
rock
island
and
the
t&p
cases.
legislation
is
required
if
there
is
a
need
in
a
public
interest
for
more
liberal
treatment
of
the
railroads
in
this
respect.
notwithstanding,
that
statement
the
commission
has
come
along
here
and
done
exactly
what
it
said
it
couldn't
do
without
legislation
to
enable
it
to
do
it.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
i
understand
that.
and
you
will
see
at
page
39
of
our
current
brief
the
--
the
--
on
my
current
brief
i'm
talking
about
the
main
brief.
we
did
file
a
reply
brief
and
you'll
see
the
reference
to
the
65th
annual
report
in
1952.
and
a
little
further,
over
on
page
40,
you
will
see
the
reference
to
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
to
the
68th
annual
report
in
1954,
where
the
commission
said
this
with
respect
to
integration.
"efforts
to
obtain
a
relaxation
of
our
interpretations
of
what
the
act
permits
in
the
operation
of
highway
motor
vehicles
by
railroads
again
were
made
during
the
year
we
had
adhered
to
our
prior
interpretation."
so
that
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
i
think
if
you
will
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
citation
from
the
court's
--
from
the
commission's
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
they
told
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
in
the
1950
case,
the
texas
and
pacific
cases.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
oh,
i
see.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
they
said
it
in
the
barker
case,
another
landmark
decision
of
the
court
--
of
the
commission,
going
to
the
very
first
decision,
that's
m.c.c.109.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
and
that's
cited
at
page
19
of
our
brief
and
i
won't
read
from
it.
but
if
i
may
read
just
one
sentence
from
it,
they
wrote
there
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
beg
your
pardon?
from
19
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
from
19,
mr.
justice
black,
in
our
brief
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
and
that's
a
citation
of
the
commission's
barker
decision.
now,
there,
of
course,
unlike
this
case
barker
was
seeking
to
purchase
--
i
don't
mean
barker,
i
mean
the
subsidiary,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
involved
there
were
seeking
to
purchase
this
barker
operation.
and
among
other
things,
the
commission
said,
the
language
of
section
213
above
quoted
is
evidence
that
congress
was
not
convinced
that
this
should
be
done.
and
when
it
made
that
statement,
it
was
talking
about
the
second
aspect
of
the
service
proposed
to
be
rendered.
in
the
barker
case,
the
railroad
subsidiary
proposed
to
render
two
kinds
of
service.
first,
it
was
going
to
provide
a
coordinated
service.
second,
it
was
going
to
provide
a
completely
independent
service
entirely
divorced
from
the
railroad
operations
and
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
of
course.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
and
we
have
cited
that
on
our
brief
several
times.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes,
sir.
not
only
to
barker
but
that
the
commission's
consistent
construction
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
--
through
the
years
and
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
law.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
absolutely.
and
if
there
is
any
question,
we
simply
refer
this
court
to
its
