now,
what's
the
fallacy
in
that
logic?(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
get
your
argument
yet
but,
do
you
mean
these
small
towns
there
are
getting
a
service
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
didn't
get
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
peddle
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whether
burden
or
not
is
--
isn't
it
a
useful
service
to
the
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they're
--
if
you
are
right
here
and
your
position
could
be
sustained,
what
would
happen
with
reference
to
that
particular
service
the
communities
are
now
getting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
argument
--
on
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
they
are
losing
the
cream
and
being
advised
to
secure
the
heart,
it
doesn't
have
the
cream
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
that
the
only
way
they
can
make
good
would
be
to
allow
to
enter
into
the
cream
territory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
in
any
proposals
in
congress
to
change
that?

black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
find
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
saying
it's
--
the
government
--
but
i'm
sure
i'd
like
to
know
this
(inaudible)
--
you
say,
that
they
say
they
can
do
indirectly
what
they
cannot
do
directly,
what
they're
forbidden
to
do
directly.
would
you
mind
stating
in
two
(inaudible)
what
they're
permitted
to
do
indirectly?
how
it
cannot
be
directly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
directly
forbids?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
by
acquisition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
board
--
if
commission
is
giving
them
a
direct
authority
to
conduct
services
in
a
way
that
it
is
forbidden
to
do
if
they
inquire
somebody
else's
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
first
case
you
referred
to?
what
was
the
first
case
in
which
the
commission
not
made
that
decision
but
actually
did
grant
privileges
of
this
kind
without
findings
as
required
by
the
five,
of
the
five
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
(voice

those
cases,
i
suppose
in
your
brief,
did
not
restrict
the
service
auxiliary
and
supplemental
to
the
railroad
but
did
they
make
findings
that
are
required
under
5
(b)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

the
competitions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
they
had
none
of
the
application
filed
immediately
after
the
approval
of
the
acquisition
and
you
had
filed
a
new
application
from
the
207
do
you
have
that
written
down
and
get
changed
right
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
make
the
finding
under
5
(2)
(b)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
consider
they'd
take
the
provisions
and
still
rely
on
the
findings
they've
made
in
acquisition
as
to
the
requirements
there
or
do
you
--
it
is
your
position
that
it
has
the
right
to
make
--
entirely
use
--
entirely
use
of
advance
or
for
general
purpose
(inaudible)
--
without
making
findings.
