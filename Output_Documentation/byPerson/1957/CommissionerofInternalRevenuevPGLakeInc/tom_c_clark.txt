i
own

the

percent
and
so
i
have
heard
of
and
i
want
to
get
some
money
and
i
figured
all
was
going
down
and
so
i
want
to
sell
in
(inaudible)
let
say,
so
i
sold
a
hundred
barrels.
justice

c.

yes.
and
the
work
and
interest
to
pay
the
expenses
of
course,
namely,
you
would
get
a

i
suppose
the
pipeline
company
will
give
you
a
check
for
the
first
hundred
barrels
that
came
out

that
be

well,
suppose
that

500

under
we'd
have
to

a
system
that
you've
just
described.

i
signed
one-fifth

i
didn't
limit
it,

it
wouldn't
be
a
capital
gain.
justice
tom
c.
clark
although
we
all
might
consider
the
facts
whether
there's
only
500
barrels
there
so
i
was
calculating
on
the
basis
of
him
only
getting
100
barrels
under
his
one-fifth.
you
said
that
will
be
kept
in.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
said
what?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
capital
gain?
