commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
petitioner
versus
p.g.
lake,
et
al.
mr.
stull.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stull,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weeks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
make
your
own
arrangement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question?
what
would
be
the
difference
between
this
and
selling
an
interest
in
the
crop,
percentage
interest
in
a
crop
yet
to
be
grown?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
orange
trees
would
be
capital
before
they
--
before
they
have
their
crops.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jackson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jackson,
what
is
the
difference
--
real
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
man
signing
an
interest
in
his
real
property
through
the
extent
of
so
much
rent
that
you
might
get
offer
to
a
building
that
is
his
--
where
they're
entitled
to
amortization
on
the
building.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
the
rental
of
the
building?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
part
of
the
building
becomes
--
it's
less
to
come
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
that
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
difference?
that's
the
thing
that
i
want.
they're
both
properties.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
have
the
same
situation
whether
you
--
with
other
real
property
whether
you
choose
to
sell
it
or
use
it
through
the
years.
if
you
sell
it,
you'll
take
a
capital
gain
and
if
you
use
it
and
if
(inaudible)
income,
you
have
to
pay
an
income
tax
(inaudible).
is
that
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
difference
between
--
between
the
two?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
basic
difference
--
the
legal
difference
between
the
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
exactly
just
give
me
an
example
as
to
that
during
the
war,
the
government
granted
short-term
amortizations,
did
they
not,
on
lot
of
buildings
seven
--
as
low
as
seven
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
five
--
five
years.
now
suppose
--
suppose
the
great
income
from
that
property
was
the
--
the
building
was
on
it
but
not
the
land
itself
and
the
person
did
exactly
what
you
did,
would
he
be
entitled
to
treat
it
as
--
as
capital
gain
rather
than
--
than
income
because
it
was
only
a
five-year
building
--
only
had
a
five-year
value?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
have
after
your
oil
is
sold.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
your
property
with
the
oil.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stull.
