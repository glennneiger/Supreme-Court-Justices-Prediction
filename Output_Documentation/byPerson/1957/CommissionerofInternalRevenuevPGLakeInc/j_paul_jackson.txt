mr.
j.
paul
jackson
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
see
it,
the
court
has
three
courses
open
to
it.
that
is
based
upon
the
prior
administrative
history
of
sale
to
carved
out
oil
payments.
now
to
run
over
briefly,
this
legislative
history
to
fill
a
few
gaps
that
were
omitted
by
mr.
weeks.
it
is
entirely
true
as
he
has
said
that
for
25
years
following
the
enactment
of
the
capital
gain
provisions
in
1921,
it
was
the
consistent
practice
of
the
treasury
department
to
recognize
that
the
sale
of
carved
out
oil
payments,
whether
they'd
be
long
or
be
short,
would
be
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment
under
1921
act.
there
are
rulings
to
that
effect
and
many
private
rulings
wish
to
that
effect
and
that
was
the
position
affirmatively
taken
by
the
government
in
several
cases.
in
1946,
as
mr.
weeks
has
said,
detecting
what
was
conceived
to
be
a
defect
in
the
law.
and
instead
of
going
to
congress,
they
sought
to
cure
this
defect
administratively.
and
that
1946
ruling
provided
that
as
to
short
term
oil
payment
or
short-lived
oil
payments
as
distinguishable
on
long-lived
oil
payments,
that
is
oil
payment
stated
to
be
one
or
two
years
in
length.
they
should
be
treated
as
assignments
of
income
and
taxed
at
normal
rates
and
denied
capital
gain
treatment.
that
ruling
was
made
prospective
in
its
operation
because
it
represented
a
change
of
existing
policy.
in
1949,
that
same
ruling
was
extended
to
donative
assignments.
that
is
when
one
gave
an
oil
payment
to
a
member
of
his
family.
if
the
oil
payment
was
short-lived,
as
distinguished
from
long-lived,
that
was
held
to
be
an
assignment
of
income
and
not
a
donation
of
property
producing
income.
that
again
was
made
prospective
in
its
operation
in
the
nail
case
which
had
involved
the
donation
of
an
oil
payment
and
which
had
been
held
to
be,
by
the
tax
court
or
the
tax
appeals
then
to
be
a
gift
of
property
and
not
a
gift
of
income
and
which
the
treasury
had
acquiesced.
that
acquiescence
was
withdrawn
and
not
a
ruling.
thereafter,
it
was
made
prospecting.
now
in
1950
for
the
first
time
they
extended
these
two
prior
rulings
to
cover
all
oil
payments
no
matter
how
long
in
duration
or
no
matter
how
short
in
duration.
all
oil
payments,
oil
due
to
large
interest,
if
sold,
were
held
to
be
sales
of
income
and
if
given
away
were
held
to
be
gifts
of
ordinary
income.
when
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
caldwell
case
refused
to
accept
i.t.
4003,
that's
the
1950
ruling,
the
government
then
receded
from
this
extreme
position.
and
in
the
hawn
case
and
again
in
the
cases
below,
went
back
to
its
original
ruling.
their
position
was
that
the
caldwell
case
was
right
that
i.t.
4003
the
extreme
rule
was
wrong
and
they
urged
for
the
insubstantial
transfer
rule.
that
is,
if
the
transfer
was
insubstantial
in
relation
to
the
reversion,
it
would
be
held
to
be
an
assignment
of
income.
if
it
were
substantial,
it
was
deemed
to
be
a
sale
of
property.
here,
they
take
the
alternative
position.
first
they
are
going
back
for
the
i.t.
4003
and
holding
that
all
oil
payments,
carved
out
of
a
large
increase
no
matter
how
long
in
duration
should
be
treated
as
assignments
of
income
as
anticipations
of
income
and
tax
to
normal
rates.
that
will
include
the
12-year
oil
payment
in
the
fleming
case
the
13-year
oil
payment
in
the
caldwell
case.
(inaudible)
say,
if
the
oil
payment
is
insubstantial
in
relation
to
this
reversion,
then,
the
--
an
insubstantial
one
should
be
taxed
as
an
assignment
of
income
and
the
substantial
one
at
capital
gain.
now,
there
are
three
courses
open
to
the
courts.
first,
you
can
take
the
extreme
view
published
first
in
1950.
since
repudiated
below,
review
of
i.t.
4003
which
is,
that
all
oil
payments,
no
matter
how
long
in
duration
shall
be
treated
as
assignments
of
income
and
taxed
at
normal
rates.
secondly,
you
can
go
back
to
the
other
extreme
and
you
can
contend
a
whole,
that
all
oil
payments,
when
sold,
no
matter
how
short
in
duration
or
sales
of
property,
sales
of
real
property,
when
congress
intended
such
to
enjoy,
the
capital
gain
benefits.
that
would
be
the
rule
in
effect
for
25
years
until
the
change
was
made
in
1946,
or
you
can
take
the
middle
ground
and
hold
the
insubstantial
oil
payments.
those
that
are
insubstantial
in
relation
to
the
reversion
or
interest
or
to
the
interest
kept,
or
truly,
by
applying
some
extension
of
the
horst
principle,
or
truly
assignments
of
income
but
those
that
are
substantial
shall
be
treated
as
sales
of
durable
substantial
property
rights
and
to
be
given
capital
gain
treatments.
that
is
the
government's
alternative
view
at
least
the
alternative
view
set
forth
from
its
brief
and
it's
a
view
that
it
urged
below.
now,
first,
is
the
extreme
view
of
i.t.
4003
right?
we
submit
on
any
basis
that
view
which
is
the
government's
primary
view
is
clearly
wrong.
that
view
would
hold
that
every
oil
payment,
no
matter
how
long
its
life
or
how
substantial,
is
to
be
treated
as
an
assignment
of
income.
now,
first,
i
think
we
should
look
to
the
committee
reports
and
those
ways
and
means
of
the
senate
finance
committee
report
in
connection
with
the
enactment
of
the
capital
gain
provisions
in
1921.
those
committee
reports
stated
clearly
that
sales
of
farms,
mineral
properties,
i
repeat,
mineral
properties,
and
other
capital
assets
have
been
recorded
by
virtue
of
the
high
surtax
rates
applicable
to
such
sales.
such
sales
have
been
deterred
and
the
purpose
of
the
capital
gain
rates
was
to
omit
such
transactions,
sales
have
been
on
properties
including
others
to
go
forward
without
the
payment
of
tax
are
represented
by
the
surtax
rates.
now,
an
oil
payment,
as
mr.
weeks
has
said
and
as
the
case
has
hold,
an
oil
payment
is
a
creature
of
the
texas
oil
men,
men
from
the
oil
states
which
was
an
interest
in
property
long
before
we
had
a
capital
gain
provision.
the
uses
of
oil
payments
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
mean
for
the
court
with
that
now.
but
they
are
mineral
property.
to
tax
a
long-term
oil
payment,
a
12-year
oil
payment
would
be
to
create
the
very
hardship
at
what
--
at
which
the
capital
gain
sections
of
the
law
were
directed.
namely,
it
would
produce
an
excessive
surtax
on
the
profits
of
a
number
of
years,
the
bunching
of
income
of
10,
12,
15
years
in
a
single
year
which
the
very
hardship
that
congress
was
aiming
at
when
it
enacted
the
capital
gain
provisions.
the
government
itself
admits
that
an
oil
payment
is
a
mineral
property
and
moreover,
that
an
oil
payment
is
a
capital
asset.
the
i.t.
4003,
which
is
the
basis
of
their
case
or
their
primary
contention,
says
specifically
that
if
a
taxpayer
owns
an
oil
payment
and
sells
it
in
its
entirety
or
sells
the
fraction
of
it
extending
over
the
life
of
the
property,
he
has
sold
the
capital
asset.
now
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
let's
--
let
me
get
to
that
question
now,
if
your
honor
please.
i
would
concede
to
the
said
argument
although
in
this
general
neighborhood
is
not
well
developed.
that
he
sale
by
me
to
a
third
party,
well
first,
a
prepayment
of
rent
is
clearly
ordinary
income
to
me
by
prepay
--
if
you
prepay
me
two
years
rent,
i
must
take
up
those
two
years
in
a
single
year
and
tax
at
normal
rates.
it's
not
a
capital
gain
transaction,
i
admit.
if
i
should
sell
rents
in
the
future
to
a
third
party
or
if
i
should
sell
dividends
on
stock
that
i
own
to
a
third
party
for
cash,
if
i
should
sell
one
or
two
years
coupons
on
a
bond,
i
think
my
own
belief
is,
all
the
cases
are
not
clear
on
this,
that
i
have
sold
income.
i
have
anticipated
income
and
what
i
get
is
simply
a
substitution
of
what
i
would
have
gotten,
had
i
not
sold
the
coupon
or
sold
the
future
rent,
or
sold
the
dividends?
i
think
i
have
normal
income
and
not
capital
gain.
conceded
that,
however,
does
not
mean
and
here
we
get
to
a
very
important
point.
it
does
not
mean
that
an
oil
payment
for
that
oil
property
or
that
oil
income
for
that
matter
is
like
income
from
other
property,
income
by
way
of
dividends
from
stock
or
interest
on
a
coupon
or
found
on
a
bond
or
rent
from
real
estate.
when
oil
in
the
ground
is
real
property,
each
barrel
of
oil
in
the
ground
is
real
property.
when
that
barrel
of
oil
is
lifted
to
the
surface,
it
is
transmuted
under
our
state
law
into
personal
property
but
still
--
it's
still
a
tangible
property.
when
that
barrel
of
oil
is
sold,
there
is
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
that
barrel
of
oil.
the
profit
is
the
difference
between
its
cost
and
its
selling
price.
its
cost
is
determined
by
taking
the
cost
of
the
entire
mineral
content
and
dividing
it
by
the
estimated
number
of
barrels
in
place
in
order
to
find
a
unit
cost
for
that
barrel
of
oil.
that's
what
we
call
cost
depletion.
each
barrel
of
oil
has
its
own
cost.
now
when
that
barrel
of
oil
is
sold,
the
difference
between
that
cost
and
its
selling
price
is
profit.
the
sale
or
the
profit
on
the
sale
of
that
barrel
ofoil
is
normal
income
is
normally
income
under
the
harmel
decision.
it's
normal
income
because
it
is
a
recurring
day
to
day
time
consuming
operation
similar
to
a
manufacturing
operation,
this
court
said
in
the
harmel
case.
but
it's
not
income
in
the
sense
of
a
dividend
from
a
stock
or
the
interest
from
a
bond.
it's
profit
from
the
sale
of
property.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
or
the
rental
of
a
building.
it's
not
the
sale
of
derivative
income
from
a
non-consuming
corpus.
it's
a
small
sale
of
a
small
piece,
to
use
(inaudible)
illustration
of
the
tree
itself.
it's
not
the
sale
of
fruits
from
a
tree.
it's
a
small
sale
of
the
tree
itself.
the
sale
of
an
oil
payment
represents
the
sale
in
bulk
of
a
number
of
barrels
all
in
place.it's
not
--
again
not
the
sale
of
fruits
and
property.
it's
a
sale
of
a
large
part
of
the
corpus
itself.
when
an
oil
payment
is
carved
out
and
sold
and
there
is
an
interest
retained,
the
oil
payment
is
not
the
fruit
of
that
which
is
kept
nor
is
that
which
is
kept
the
reversion
or
interest,
the
corpus
that
produces
that
which
is
sold
--
that
which
is
sold
representing
these
barrels
in
place.
they
sold
to
the
purchaser
who
consumes
that
in
the
process.
and
in
that
consumptive
process,
that
part
of
the
property
never
comes
back.
now
they
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
no.
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
i
haven't
considered
that
depreciation
on
a
building
would
be
comparable
to
the
sale
of
oil
in
the
ground
or
maybe
there's
an
analogy
there,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
let
me
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
lead
--
if
i
can
get
it
this
way.
while
the
sale
of
an
oil
payment
is
not
the
sale
of
the
fruits
of
property
in
that
sense,
it
is
clear
that
it
is
to
an
anticipation
of
income.
it's
an
anticipation
of
income
in
the
sense
that
had
you
not
sold
it
but
had
you
kept
it
and
produced
it
on
a
barrel
by
barrel
basis.
all
of
it
would
have
been
normal
income
to
you.
that's
the
unique
characteristics
of
any
natural
resource.
it
is
depletable
in
nature.
it's
relatively
short-lived.
and
because
of
its
depletable
nature,
it
carries
within
it
both
the
concept
of
a
true
property
right
which
it
is
a
mineral
property
and
at
the
same
time,
the
concept
of
an
oil
being
income.
in
the
oil
property,
if
kept
to
its
ultimate
life,
is
all
income.
any
oil
property,
if
sold
at
once
is
all
capital.
it's
all
capital
and
yet
all
income.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
when
you
sell
an
oil
payment,
you
would
be
taxed
at
normal
rates
because
you
have
simply
anticipated
income
then
that
means
that
on
the
sale
of
any
mineral
property
whether
it
would
be
a
royalty,
whether
it
would
be
a
lease,
or
whether
it
would
be
a
working
interest,
or
an
oil
payment,
and
you
sell
any
property
outright
or
fractional
interest
in
it.
in
a
sense,
you
by
virtue
of
that
sale,
anticipating
income,
you
are
getting
today
a
price
for
that
which
had
you
not
made
the
sale
would
have
all
been
income
to
you.
and
yet
since
1921,
the
cases
all
hold
and
the
bureau's
position
and
the
treasury
position
is
solid
that
when
you
sell
an
entire
interest
or
a
fractional
interest,
you
have
sold
the
capital
asset.
as
the
court
said
in
the
america
case,
if
that
were
not
true,
then,
the
language
of
the
committee
report
is
meaningless.
the
committee
report
of
the
1921
act
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
capital
gain
was
to
enable
sales
of
mineral
properties
to
go
forward
without
the
oppressive
surtax
rates.
now,
if
--
if
this
thing
is
not
the
assignment
of
the
fruit
from
a
tree,
what
if
it
is
an
anticipation
of
income
in
the
same
sense
that
the
sale
of
any
oil
property
is
a
sale
of
income.
we
conceive
then
that
this
oil
payment
is
like
a
coin
--
a
coin.
on
one
side,
we
see
the
inscription.
this
gives
you
the
right
to
future
production.
this
is
the
anticipation,
if
you
will,
of
future
income.
and
on
the
other
side,
it's
clearly
inscription
that
this
is
indeed
a
mineral
property.
it
is
a
mineral
property
under
state
law
and
for
federal
purposes.
it's
a
depletable
property,
and
it's
this
dual
characteristic
that
causes
us
the
problem
here.
now,
if
we're
to
meet
that
problem
by
saying
every
sale,
every
carved
out
oil
payment
irrespective
of
life,
is
to
be
treated
as
assignment
of
income.
we
get
into
some
absurdities.
take
for
example
the
12-year
life
oil
payment
against
which
there
is
remaining
two-year
life
in
the
form
of
a
reversion
or
interest.
can
it
be
said
that
when
that
oil
payment
is
covered
up
for
the
12-year
life
representing
perhaps
90%
of
the
oil
in
place
which
you
have
anticipated
income
that
--
that
is
the
sale
of
the
fruits
from
a
tree,
that
the
horst
case
has
got
any
application
whatever,
that
the
--
that
the
corpus
that
produces
this
income
is
the
two-year
remaining
residual
life
of
this
property
the
10%
that's
left.
isn't
it
clear
that
what
you
have
done
is
that
you've
sold
a
substantial
--
a
large
part
of
your
mineral
property
and
you've
anticipated
income
only
in
the
sense
that
any
sale,
any
mineral
property
is
an
anticipation
of
income.
if
the
bureau
is
right
and
the
service
is
right
that
the
sale
of
an
oil
payment
is
a
capital
asset
if
you
sell
it
all,
you
sell
your
entire
interest
in
it,
we
have
this
anomaly.
i
have
a
two-year
oil
payment
as
a
two-year
life.
i
sell
it
all.
i
get
capital
gain.
i
carved
out
an
oil
payment
with
the
12-year
life
and
i'm
taxed
with
normal
rates.
i
sell
a
short-lived
oil
payment
representing
a
thousand
barrel
to
oil
in
place.
if
i
sell
it
all,
i
get
capital
gain.
but
if
i
sell
a
million
barrel
of
oil
in
place
in
the
form
of
a
carved
out
oil
payment,
i'm
taxed
to
normal
rates
because
for
suit,
i
hold
back
one
single
barrel
of
oil.
now,
clearly
congress
didn't
intend
results
of
that
nature.
another
one.
i
sell
an
undivided
tenth
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
yes,
if
i
use
it
and
if
i
can
take
the
income
from
day
to
day.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
the
legal
difference
between
the
two
as
i
see
it
your
honor
are
these.
in
the
case
of
real
estate,
you
have
an
eternal
perpetual
life.in
the
case
of
real
estate,
rents
were
paid
to
you.
those
rents
are
paid
from
year
to
year.
they
had
arrived
from
a
non-depleting
corpus.
and
if
you
sell
two
years,
for
example,
of
your
rents
or
give
away
two
years
of
your
rent
assignment,
you
still
have
your
real
property
left.
you
still
have
your
corpus
left
capable
of
reproducing
income
forever.
but
if
i
sell
an
oil
payment
out
of
my
property,
my
property
to
begin
with
is
relatively
short-lived.
it's
not
eternal
or
perpetual
such
as
real
estate
generally
is.
being
a
mineral
property,
it
has
a
relatively
short
life.
that's
one
big
difference.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
the
other
is
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
five
years
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
well,
if
i
sold
the
building,
there's
no
question
that
i
would
get
capital
gain.
you're
selling
five
years
of
rents
from
the
building.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
if
i'm
selling
five
years
rent
from
the
building
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
--
in
advance,
there
is
no
case
saying
that
i'm
denied
capital
gain
treatment
that
i
know
of.
but
i
would
suspect
that
i
would
be
denied
capital
gain
treatment
certainly
under
the
treasury
practice.
this
area
of
--
to
what
extent
you
can
sell
future
income
indefinitely,
to
what
extent
that
certainly
becomes
capital,
we
don't
know.
for
example
we
wouldn't
know
if
you
took
all
of
it
--
the
coupons
from
a
20-year
bond
and
sold
it
whether
you're
selling
capital
or
you're
selling
future
income.
a
good
argument
could
be
made
on
either
side,
if
your
honor
please.
but
your
difference
here
is
that
in
terms
of
relationship
between
what
you
have
sold
and
what
you
have
left,
when
you
sell
five
years
of
rents
from
your
building
and
the
five
years
go
by,
you
still
have
your
--
your
property
unimpaired
except
for
depreciation
of
course.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
now,
when
you
sell
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
no.
but
when
you
sell
a
piece
of
property,
an
oil
property,
we'll
say
they
have
a
10-year
life
and
you
sell
five
years
of
it.
you've
sold
half
of
the
property
itself.
you
see
the
difference?
that
when
you
sell
an
oil
payment,
you
are
not
only
anticipating
income
but
you
are
selling
the
corpus
because
that
is
the
essential
nature
of
these
natural
resources
is
that
they
deplete.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
not
--
not
hardly,
your
honor.
not
hardly.
when
you
have
a
greater
rate
up
to
91%
and
you
punch
as
in
the
o'connor
case,
$10,000,000
of
income
in
one
year.
your
effective
rate
after
you
take
27.5%
off
of
91%,
you
have
an
effective
tax
rate
of
about
66%.
we
contend
that
congress
intended
that
we
should
have
a
25%
rate.
the
depletion
does
not
take
the
place
from
the
mathematical
point
of
view
but
when
you
sell
property,
your
honor,
when
you
sell
a
mineral
property
or
a
fractional
interest
in
the
mineral
property,
the
rule
is
that
you
do
not
get
depletion.
the
rule
is
and
has
always
been
that
you
get
capital
gain.
the
rule
always
has
been
that
you
cannot
have
both
depletion
and
capital
gain.
you
must
have
one
or
the
other.
in
the
case
of
normal
income
you
take
depletion.
in
the
case
of
a
capital
transaction,
you
take
capital
gain
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
your
honor,
we
couldn't
spend
a
more
enjoyable
evening
talking
about
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
depletion
allowance.
the
27.5%
was
given
in
1926
to
the
oil
people
as
a
substitute
for
discover
depletion,
right
or
wrong.
it
was
given
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
grace
shall
we
say
to
the
oil
people
because
of
the
risk
of
the
enterprise
and
so
on.
but
it
was
given
as
against
normal
income
--
against
the
current
production
to
replace
a
diminishing
capital
asset
taken
into
account
the
--
the
nature
of
this
oil
property.
but
when
you
are
selling
a
large
part
of
your
property,
i'll
go
back
to
my
illustration
again.
is
it
--
could
it
be
true
that
congress
intended
that
i
could
sell
an
undivided
10%
interest
in
my
royalty
representing
a
thousand
barrels
of
oil
in
place
and
it
would
be
clear
that
i
have
capital
gain
as
the
government
admits.
and
yet,
if
i
sell
90%
of
my
property
in
the
form
of
a
carved
out
oil
payment
representing
a
million
barrels
of
oil
in
place
and
i'm
denied
a
capital
gain
treatment
because
i
kept
the
last
10%,
does
it
make
this
much
difference
that
the
--
that
the
transaction
is
horizontal
rents
have
been
vertical.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
i
don't
think
it
quite
concedes
that
but
let
me
--
let
me
clarify
one
thing
in
your
honor's
mind.
i
think
you've
been
disturbed
about
the
money
part
of
this,
the
--
the
dollar
amount
the
dollar
sign
on
these
oil
payments.
let's
clear
that
up.
the
--
an
oil
payment
represents
the
ownership
of
a
certain
quantity
of
oil
in
place
that
is
limited
in
amount
that
is
the
number
of
barrels
in
place
is
limited.
it
therefore
called
a
limited
overriding
royalty,
more
properly
known.
now,
if
i
grant
you
an
oil
payment
giving
you
the
right
to
the
first
9000
barrels
of
oil
in
place,
there's
no
question
but
that
you
have
ownership
of
9000
barrels
in
place
and
you
become
the
owner
of
it
when
it's
produced.
now
instead
of
making
it
in
form
of
barrels,
i
grant
to
you
an
oil
payment
which
carries
with
it
ownership
in
the
ground
of
a
number
of
barrels
in
place
that
will
equal
in
dollars
when
and
as
produced
$27,000.
that
gives
you
9000
barrels
in
place
if
the
oil
produces
$3
a
barrel
when
produced.
the
dollar
sign
on
the
oil
payment
and
unfortunately
when
you
have
this
word
payment,
it
doesn't
really
mean
payment.
the
dollar
sign,
the
dollar
amount
in
an
oil
payment
is
simply
the
measuring
sticks,
the
dollar
amount
that
identifies
or
measures
the
quantity
of
oil
in
ground
that
you
own.
the
--
the
--
there
is
also
in
these
oil
payments
a
grant
of
a
sufficient
amount
of
oil
in
place
which
when
produced,
saved
and
sold
that
will
not
only
produce
these
dollars
but
that
will
produce
an
amount
equal
to
ad
valorem
taxes
and
production
taxes.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
exactly
so.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
oh,
yes.
you
have
title
to
--
it's
like
fungible
goods.
you
have
title
to
the
first
amount
of
oil
whatever
amount
that
maybe
that
will
produce
you
$27,000.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
well,
that
oil
is
--
is
yours
in
place.
it
sends
to
you
as
--
as
real
property
would
be
sent
in
the
law
of
texas.
it's
conveyed
as
real
--
real
property
is
conveyed.
it's
subject
to
the
statute
of
fraud
as
real
property
is
subject.
it
is
real
property
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
yes.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
i'm
sorry,
i
haven't
answered
you
correctly
but
it's
--
the
dollars
are
measuring
sticks
for
oil
in
place.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
if
--
yes,
sir.
he
gets
a
cost
depletion
allowance.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
i
get
a
capital
gain.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
the
government
gets
a
good
deal,
your
honor.
the
government
gets
25%
from
me
and
if
--
and
not
too
much
from
you
if
you
have
paid
a
price
about
equal
to
the
discounted
value
of
the
expected
recovery.
yes.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
that
would
be
true.
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
if
--
if
i
own
a
two-year
oil
payment
which
i
bought
and
i
sell
it
to
you
at
a
discount,
i
get
capital
gain
on
it.
you
would
set
up
your
cost
as
the
cost
of
that
oil
payment
which
would
give
you
cost
depletion
which
should
mean
that
there
would
be
very
small
income
to
you,
an
interest
element
only
in
you.
how
much
time
i
have
--
mr.
j.
paul
jackson
my
time
is
up.
well,
i
--
i
haven't
had
chance
to
get
into
the
other
two
possibilities
for
this
court.
i
refer
to
our
briefs
for
those
possibilities.
thank
you.
