mr.
harry
c.
weeks
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
p.g.
lake,
incorporated
and
william
fleming,
et
al.
and
mr.
jackson
will
speak
for
it
and
others
and
i
do
not
want
to
take
over
a
half
an
hour
if
the
court
could
warn
me
at
that
time.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
all
right.
as
mr.
stull
had
said
in
the
fleming
case,
there
are
two
questions.
and
if
i
may,
i
will
follow
his
lead
although
the
question
which
he
termed
subsidiary
was
the
question
upon
which
we
won
below.
that
is
that
the
exchange
of
these
oil
payments
or
other
real
estate
was
nontaxable
under
the
expressed
terms
of
section
112
(b)
(1)
of
the
1939
code.
as
we
see
the
matter,
the
commissioner
is
trying
to
exercise
what
is
clearly
a
legislative
prerogative.
there
is
much
more
to
this
question
than
counsel
indicated.
the
capital
gain
provisions
were
introduced
in
1921.
as
far
as
this
question
is
concerned,
there
has
been
no
change
from
1921
down
through
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
from
1921
until
1946,
it
was
the
consistent
practice
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
treat
the
carving
out
and
sale
of
an
oil
payment
as
productive
of
capital
gain
if
the
holding
period
of
the
property
was
present.
counsel
said
that
the
first
published
ruling
was
in
1946.
i
call
attention
to
one
in
1941
which
is
quoted
in
my
brief
on
page
111,
the
latter
part
of
the
italicized
portion
there,
expressly
holds
that
the
carving
out
of
an
oil
payment
is
a
sale
of
an
interest
in
the
property
as
to
which
gain
is
calculated
in
the
ordinary
way.
not
only
was
that
the
position
of
the
commissioner
during
which
time
we've
had
i'd
say
20
reenactments
of
the
--
a
capital
gain
provision.
it
was
the
position
of
the
courts.
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
ortiz
oil
company
case
expressly
held
that
the
carving
out
and
sale
of
an
oil
payment
and
some
properties
in
east
texas
did
--
was
a
sale
of
an
interest
in
the
property
that
the
seller
was
not
entitled
to
depletion.
that
the
depletion
went
to
the
oil
payment
purchaser
and
that
the
ortiz
oil
company's
seller
calculated
its
gain
from
the
sale
and
said
it
was
the
sale
of
an
interest
in
the
profit
just
as
any
other
profit
from
a
sale
is
computed
by
subtracting
selling
price
from
--
basis
from
selling
price.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
39
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
the
tax
court.
it
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1939
and
this
court
refused
certiorari
as
strenuously
argued
or
the
very
thing
that
they
argued
--are
arguing
for
here
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
i
was
--
i
was
denied
all
the
way
down.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
yes.
all
the
way,
i
tried
to
get
in
this
court
but
i
couldn't.
and
it
was
expressly
held,
i
believe,
judge
mccord,
i
believe,
wrote
the
opinion
and
in
the
fifth
circuit.
i've
forgotten
the
author
in
the
tax
court.
it
was
expressly
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
a
sale
of
an
interest
in
the
property.
perhaps
there
are
other
cases
to
the
same
effect.
in
the
reply
brief
that
was
handed
to
me
just
before
the
court
convened
today,
it
stated,
i
believe,
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
ortiz
case
because
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
that
oil
payment
were
paid
for
the
development.
i
--
i
do
not
believe
the
record
supports
that
statement.
with
that
long
history
before
us
--
before
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
with
the
ortiz
case
and
perhaps
other
cases,
and
i
would
say
an
unlimited
number
of
private
rulings
where
they've
held
that
the
carving
out
and
the
sale
of
oil
payments
produced
long-term
capital
gain
other
conditions
being
present.
the
general
counsel
of
the
internal
revenue
service
in
1946
ruled
at
a
short-lived
oil
payment.
one
that
ordinarily
paid
out
in
one
or
two
years
produced
ordinary
depletable
income.
now
although
that
was
directly
contrary
to
ortiz
and
their
previous
practice,
the
only
case
that
they
cited
there
was
a
case
where
a
man
sold
a
declared
dividend
on
stock
and
kept
the
stock.
and
they
expressly
said
there
that
horst
and
known
other
cases
were
not
pertinent.
the
--
this
court
held
in
1937
that
where
an
oil
lease
or
leases
were
assigned
with
an
informal
retention
of
an
oil
payment.
a
part
of
the
lease
was
sold
and
a
part
of
it
retained,
so
that
the
assignee
who
was
before
the
court
in
that
case,
thomas
versus
perkins,
so
that
the
assignee
could
not
be
required
to
report
as
a
part
of
his
income.
the
oil
applicable
to
that
retained
all
payment
interest.
that
was
a
very
informal
agreement
as
contrasted
with
the
formality
in
which
not
barrels
of
oil,
not
a
right
to
collect
from
the
pipeline
or
so
but
an
interest
in
an
oil
and
gas
lease
which
entitles
them
to
a
certain
right
in
that
and
limits
it
by
dollars
when
as
and
if
produced.
the
--
you
take
the
ortiz
case
and
the
perkins
case
and
the
uniform
holdings
that
whoever
has
an
economic
interest
in
property
is
entitled
to
depletion
on
the
income
from
that
property.
that
is
the
income
relating
to
that
depletion,
to
that
interest
and
must
be
report
it.
and
the
definition
frequently
reiterated,
i
believe,
the
last
was
in
southwest
exploration
case,
that
anyone
who
must
look
solely
to
oil
or
gas
and
same
is
true
of
any
other
members
when
as
and
if
produced
for
the
recovery
of
his
investment
as
a
depletable
economic
interest
which
is
ownership
in
the
perkins
case,
in
quoting
from
palmer
versus
bender,
this
court
said
that
ownership
was
essential.
now,
counsel
has
not
tried
to
tell
this
court
why
it
is
that
a
retained
oil
payment
is
a
different
character
of
interest
from
a
carved
out
oil
payment.
he
hasn't
tried
to
tell
the
court,
although
he
very
frankly
and
properly
admits,
that
if
the
man
in
his
original
example
that
had
the
thousand
barrel
royalty,
if
he
sold
that
entire
royalty,
mr.
stull
would
have
given
him
capital
gain.
if
he
sold
an
undivided
tenth
interest
in
it,
he
would
have
given
him
capital
gain.
if
he
sold
the
most
minutes
of
fraction
as
long
as
it
extended
for
the
economic
life
of
the
property,
he
would
have
gotten
capital
gain.
but
the
--
in
1946,
they
discovered
there
was
a
difference
in
property
pending
on
how
you
carved
it
out
and
how
long
it
lasts
and
so
forth
in
the
hands
of
the
purchaser
rather
than
in
the
hands
of
the
seller.
now
in
19
--
in
1948,
i
believe
it
was,
to
show
what
the
practice
was
before,
the
bureau
ruled
at
this,
i.t.
24
of
the
1946
general
counsel
memorandum
would
not
be
applied
retroactively
to
transactions
before
april
1,
1946.
just
in
the
leslie
salt
case,
i
think
that
is
conclusive.
referring
to
that
date,
the
commissioner
recognized
transactions
as
we
say
that
he
did.
that
situation
went
on
until
1950
when
the
commissioner
said
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
distinguish
between
the
practical
or
legal
effect
of
short-time
or
long-term
oil
payments.
and
therefore,
again,
without
any
further
authority,
they
would
all
be
treated
as
producing
ordinary
depletable
income.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
i
--i
don't
think
they
expressly
said
they
were
unsound,
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
--
but
they
--they
certainly
cited
and
discussed
and
were
not
followed.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
the
first
as
the
short-live
one
was
1946,
mr.
justice
harlan.
then
his
intermediate
ruling
and
they're
set
out
in
--
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
in
full,
i'm
sorry
they
were
so
long
but
i
didn't
write
them.
the
--
it
was
in
1948,
i
believe,
where
he
said
he
wouldn't
apply
that
retroactively.
then
in
1950,
he
went
all
the
way.
now,
two
of
our
transactions,
one
was
1948,
and
one
1949.
those
were
the
transactions
involved
in
the
fleming
case.
now
we
say
that
under
the
leslie
salt
company
case,
he
had
no
right
to
change
a
position
which
had
been
repeatedly
approved
by
reenactment
of
the
statute
which
had
been
approved
by
the
courts
and
which
is
entirely
different
from
the
automobile
club
of
michigan
case
where
it
was
more
or
less
of
a
private
ruling
which
everybody
admit
it
was
wrong.
the
only
person
that's
ever
said
this
was
wrong
is
the
government
since
1950.
the
(inaudible)
case
on
which
their
petition
for
certiorari
was
predicated,
held
that
it
was
essentially
alone
so
that
the
assignor
of
the
oil
payment
was
taxable
as
the
oil
was
produced
and
applied
to
the
oil
payment.
we
don't
think
that's
right
but
if
it
is
right,
may
--
and
that's
what
they
got
certiorari
on
the
conflict.
if
it
is
right,
then,
most
of
these
cases
go
out
the
window
because
the
year
of
production
is
not
before
the
court
or
substantive
time
of
the
year
of
the
production.
i
believe
some
of
the
fleming
oil
payments
and
by
the
way
some
of
them
lasted
or
still
lasting,
they
--
they
have
an
expected
life
for
10
or
12
years
made
in
1948.
judge
hutcheson
in
one
of
his
opinions
below
said
that
perhaps
the
most
startling
example
of
the
commissioner's
prerogative
--
presumed
prerogative
to
legislate
was
with
respect
to
the
depletion.
now
this
court
has
held
in
twin
bell
oil
syndicate
that
you
can't
have
a
double
depletion
allowance.
this
court
has
held
that
everyone
who
must
look
to
oil
when
as
and
if
produced
is
entitled
to
depletion
on
that
oil
when
as
and
if
produced.
so
this
people
who
acquired
these
oil
payments
cannot
be
denied
depletion
with
respect
to
their
income
during
the
lives
of
these
oil
payments,
but
the
commissioner
in
the
face
of
his
success
in
the
ortiz
case
where
it
was
held
that
the
carved
or
outer
was
not
entitled
to
depletion
said,
“oh
yes,
you're
entitled
to
it.”
and
he
just
changes
the
holding
of
this
court
and
holdings
of
every
court
that's
ever
passed
on
it
by
saying
out
of
where
this
depletion
deduction
on
the
sale
of
a
capital
asset.
and
it's
the
only
time
in
the
history
of
depletion
that
it's
ever
been
done.
and
it
--
as
i
say,
it
thwarts
the
--
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
helvering
versus
twin
bell
oil
syndicate.
now,
there's
a
footnote
from
page
37
of
the
government's
brief,
footnote
17,
which
says
that
--
well
the
first
thing
you
do
you
--
the
oil
payment
purchaser
recovers
his
cost
and
then
he
gets
depletion
--
percentage
depletion
on
his
excess.
well
that
is
not
now
and
has
never
been
the
practice
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue.
you
just
can't
get
that.
and
if
you
could
get
it,
it
would
be
absolutely
contrary
because
you'd
be
getting
cost
depletion
isn't
plus
--
plus
percentage
depletion.
you
don't
get
your
capital
back
as
oil
is
produced.
you
have
no
right
to
get
your
capital
back
as
oil
is
produced.
this
court
held
that
under
the
1913
act.
you
only
get
what
congress
says
you
can
get
and
they
say
you
can
get
either
cost
depletion,
they
say
now
that
you
can
only
get
cost
depletion
or
percentage
depletion
but
you
cannot
get
both.
the
necessary
effect
of
their
contention,
the
--
nobody
in
the
internal
revenue
service
or
no
court
would
or
could
deny
the
oil
payment
holder
depletion
on
its
proceeds
is
to
allow
the
forbidden
double
deduction
for
depletion.
now
those
aims
are
very
closely
connected
because
depletion
and
income
go
together
and
income
and
ownership
go
together.
this
people
did
contest,
didn't
get
an
order
on
the
pipeline,
they
got
a
deed.
and
they
had
the
right
to
have
that
oil
delivered
to
them
at
the
top
--
on
top
of
the
ground
without
expense.
they
could
sell
it.
they
could
give
it
away
or
do
anything
they
wanted
to
with
it.
and
if
it
--
well,
it
didn't
happen
to
be
present
and
mr.
stull's
geology
is
a
little
better
than
a
lot
of
people
because
he
says
you
can't
tell
all
about
it.
the
people
to
finance
mccarthy,
the
bank
insurance
company
will
be
glad
to
have
had
him
at
the
appropriate
time.
but
they
had
to
take
over
all
these
properties
because
they
couldn't
quite
--
quite
figure
it
out
accurately.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
but
they
--
they
answered
the
lowest
would
fall
on
the
oil
payment
holder
if
the
property
is
destroyed
or
non-existing.
the
oil
payment
holder
can
sell
that
or
dispose
of
it
if
he
sees
fit
without
accountability
to
anyone.
it's
liable
to
his
debts
and
for
not
--
the
debt
--
not
with
the
debt
of
another.
if
that
doesn't
comply
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
complete
ownership
and
they're
not
ownership
of
oil
after
it
gets
at
the
top
of
the
ground.
if
so,
an
oil
payment
holder
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
depletion,
because
this
court
held
in
bank
line
that
when
it
gets
to
the
top
of
the
ground
and
you
deal
with
it
there
as
an
article
of
commerce,
it's
not
a
depletable
property
anymore.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
so.
now,
mr.
jackson
represents
mr.
--
and
i
--
i
don't
think
i've
ever
read
that
instrument
but
it's
different
from
all
i
ever
saw
if
he
didn't.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
oh
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
and
in
the
lake
case
while
it
wasn't
printed
in
this
record.
mr.
lake
signed
a
division
order
saying
i'm
the
owner
of
an
interest
in
--
of
a
certain
specified
interest
in
these
two
leases,
and
i
certify
that
and
the
--
from
now
on,
beginning
at
7:00
a.m.
on
january
1,
1951,
you'll
pay
me
for
this
fraction
of
the
oil.
now,
he
could
have
changed
its
pipeline
connection,
he
could
have
gone
after
and
done
anything
he
wanted
to
with
that
oil.
the
obligation
of
his
assignor
terminated
when
it
was
delivered
in
the
ordinary
way
that
oil
is
delivered.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
well
they
do.
they
--
they
convey
the
oil
with
the
accompanying
right
to
receive.
it
--
it's
--
the
dollar
is
limited,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
when
--
when
you
got
an
oil
of
a
certain
value,
what
we
call
the
face
amount
plus
the
amount
equal
to
interest
which
is
really
just
more
oil,
then
your
--
your
right
is
terminated
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
well
may
i
--
may
i
read
a
sample
instrument
in
the
fleming
case.
they
are
all
substantially
the
same.
i'm
reading
from
page
171
of
the
record.
it
is
said
william
fleming
does
hereby
sell,
assign,
and
convey
under
the
said
mrs.
marie
(inaudible).
her
heir
had
assigned.
the

each
and
all
of
the
oil
and
gas
leases
described
above
amounting
to
a
certain
fraction
in
and
to
all
of
the
oil
in,
under
or
that
maybe
produce,
saved,
and
marketed
from
the
above
described
practice
of
land
under
the
terms
of
the
oil
and
gas
leases.
then
it
goes
ahead
with
governance
until
they've
received
there
from
oil
of
the
net
value
of
$73,500.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
it
--
it
merely
measures
the
interest
of
the
assignee
in
the
oil
in
place
just
as
frequently
we
have
fluctuating
royalty
interest.
ordinarily,
in
most
cases
of
royalty
is
an
eight.
there
are
numerous
cases
where
they
say
well,
if
a
daily
production
is
50
barrels
or
more
then
the
oil
would
be
three-sixteenth
or
one-fourth
and
so
forth.
and
it
goes
up
and
down
and
fluctuates
when
the
--
as
the
situation
varies
from
day
to
day.
now,
if
i
may,
i
think
i'd
better
get
to
the
question.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
that's
true
of
everybody
that
has
an
oil
interest
unless
he
has
his
own
refinery
and
pipeline
and
runs
it
to
--
refines
and
market
it.
everybody
gets
their
pipeline
checked.
that's
the
customary
way
except
quite
recently
we've
had
trouble
getting
pipeline
connections.
but
if
they
can
get
a
pipeline
connection,
that's
what
they
do.
everybody!
now,
we
don't
think
in
the
fleming
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
it
has
finally
changed.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
ordinary
depletable
income.
that
would
be
his
contention.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
mr.
--
mr.
justice
whittaker,
our
kick
on
the
fleming
case
is
that,
because
they
were
48
and
49,
our
kick
on
the
lake
case
because
we
didn't
think
the
commissioner
was
right.
we
thought
what
the
fifth
circuit
had
told
us
in
the
ortiz
case
was
right
and
that
he
had
no
right
to
change
his
position
so
we
went
right
on
the
face
of
this
thing
there.
and
that
is
exactly
the
situation
unless
it's
sold.
you
will
recall
that
general
motors
acceptance
case
was
decided
in
1947.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
[laughs]
well,
i'll
have
to
wait
a
few
weeks
to
say
--
to
answer
that.
i
hope
it
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
court.[laughs]
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
oh,
yes.
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
we
sold
just
exactly
what
section
117
said.
we
sold
property.
we
didn't
held
--
sell
property
held
primarily
for
sale
and
it
is
--
comes
within
the
expressed
terms
of
it.
the
watson
case
or
the
fruit
case,
mr.
justice
clark
was
very
careful
to
distinguish
between
an
annual
recurring
crop
and
an
irreplaceable
substance
like
oil
and
even
one
that
takes
a
long
time
to
replace
like
timber.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
yes,
sir.
and
as
i
was
trying
to
get
--
and
that
applies
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
only
to
the
fleming
case.
and
i
don't
think
we
should
get
to
it
in
the
fleming
case
because
under
section
112
(b)
(1)
of
the
1939
code,
we
think
these
were
nontaxable
exchanges
as
the
court
below
held.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
no,
sir,
because
those
cars
are
its
stock
and
trade.
they
make
them
primarily
for
sale.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
oil
in
the
ground
is
capital.
when
it
gets
on
top
of
the
ground,
it's
an
entirely
different
thing.
this
court
told
us
in
harmel
that
you
couldn't
sell
oil
in
the
ground.
we
--
you
sell
a
right
to
go
in
there
and
see
--
and
see
what
you
can
do.
but
now,
you
take
--
you
take
mr.
stull's
position.
he
says
you
sell
your
royalty
interest,
you
get
capital
gain.
you
sell
10%
of
your
royal
interest,
you
get
capital
gain.
he
said
that
if
--if
you
sell
your
royalty
interest
and
retain
that
oil
payment
--
retain
an
oil
payment
and
then
sell
that
oil
payment
to
get
capital
gain.
but
they
say
this
carving
out.
this
cesarean
creation
of
--
of
this
interest
distinguishes
it
and
makes
a
future
income.
well
now,
it's
not
nearest
future
if
you
sold
all
of
it.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
if
it's
sold
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
if
it's
a
whole
one-tenth
of
its
factories.
yes,
sir.
now,
the
--
the
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
i
make
the
distinction
and
the
statute
makes
the
distinction.
the
statute
accepts
from
the
application
of
capital
gain,
personal
property
held
primarily
for
sale
to
customers.
we
are
not
in
the
business
of
selling
oil
payments
or
oil
in
the
ground.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
we
sell
oil
after
it's
produced.
and
if
we
were,
if
i
may
say
this,
mr.
justice
black,
if
your
distinction
was
sound
then
mr.
stull's
original
statement
that
selling
your
entire
royalty
interest
or
his
statement
that
selling
an
undivided
interest
in
the
lease
to
last
for
the
economic
life
of
it
would
be
absolutely
unsound
but
it
is
not.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
well,
you
can
make
a
contract
to
sell
oil
when
--
after
it's
produced.
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
if
you
didn't
produce
it.
i
imagine
your
purchaser,
if
you
sold
him
a
thousand
barrels
of
oil
to
be
produced
next
month
and
delivered
into
his
tanks
and
you
didn't
produced
it,
i'm
imagining
he's
going
to
take
his
money
back.
well
we
can't
get
our
money
back
on
these
things.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
we
expressly
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
oh,
there
are
many
oil
payments
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
oh,
no.
this
--
fortunately
these
things
paid
out.
i
say
--
the
lake
paid
out.
most
of
the
fleming
paid
out
whether
their
--
the
10
to
12-year
wouldn't
pay
out
or
neither.
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
will.
but
if
you
take
the
lake
payment
at
the
time
that
proper
--
that
payment
was
sold,
we
were
allowed
to
produce
20
days
a
month.
today
we're
allowed
to
produce
nine
days
a
month.
it
would
have
taken
seven
or
eight
years
without
a
change
in
price
or
change
in
allowance.
the
fleming
payments
under
the
same
standard
would
last
through
30
or
40
years.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
i
refer
the
--
to
the
court's
opinion
in
thomas
versus
perkins,
where
it
was
expressed
easily.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
i
think
--
i
think
the
bureau
would
hold
that
was
an
oil
payment
and
--
and
the
industry
would
hold
it
was
an
oil
payment.
and
i'm
infringing
on
mr.
jackson's
time.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
well,
your
crop
is
an
annual
recurring
thing.
it's
not
--
it's
not
capital.
oil
in
the
ground
is
capital.
if
it
is
not,
then
the
whole
--
whole
treatment
of
it
from
--
by
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
and
the
courts
for
40
years
is
absolutely
wrong.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
yes,
and
nobody
has
ever
said
that
selling
orange
tress
didn't
produce
capital
gain.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
it's
the
crop.
now,
we
don't
have
an
oil
crop.
if
they
can
go
down
in
the
ground
and
say
here
are
a
certain
number
of
barrels
that
are
income,
here
are
a
certain
number
of
barrels
that
are
capital.
well,
there
might
be
some
to
their
theory
but
it
is
all
capital
down
there.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
nobody.
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
the
--
in
our
cases
the
lessee,
that
man
that
had
the
working
interest
continued
to
produce,
paid
the
expenses,
and
deliver
this
oil
to
the
pipeline.
that
--
mr.
harry
c.
weeks
yes,
sir.
yes.
you
--
you
deliver
to
one
pipeline
and
you
can
--
first
found
a
particular
lease.
thank
you,
your
honor.
