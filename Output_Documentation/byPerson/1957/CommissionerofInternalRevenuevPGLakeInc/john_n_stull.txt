mr.
john
n.
stull
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
four
out
of
this
five
cases
involved
oil
and
gas.
the
weed
case
involves
sulphur
since
both
of
these
are
natural.
mr.
john
n.
stull
sulphur,
yes,
sir.
since
both
of
these
are
natural
resources,
we
don't
see
any
valid
distinction
for
the
purposes
of
the
question
involved
in
this
litigation.
so,
i'd
rather
for
simplicity,
just
refer
to
oil
and
gas.
all
five
of
these
cases
involved
the
same
fundamental
problem.
that
is
where
an
oil
payment
is
carved
out
of
a
larger
interest
are
the
proceeds
from
the
assignment
of
that
oil
payment
entitled
to
the
sharply
preferential
tax
treatment
accorded
to
capital
gains
by
section
117
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
or
are
they
as
the
government
contends,
merely
a
substitute
for
and
paid
in
lieu
of
the
ordinary
income
which
would
have
been
payable
in
--
on
these
interests
that
this
assignment
not
been
made.
the
fleming
case
involves
a
subsidiary
question
which
i'd
like
to
put
of
until
last.
now,
section
117
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
has
been
before
this
court
many
times
gives
us
preferential
treatment
to
the
taxation
of
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
or
exchange
of
capital
assets.
capital
assets
are
defined
as
all
property
of
the
taxpayer
with
certain
specific
instruction
--
certain
specific
exceptions.
we
are
not
going
to
any
specific
exception
on
this
case.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
from
burnet
against
harmel
in
1932
to
the
corn
products
case
in
1955
that
all
property
that
does
not
come
within
the
specific
exception,
still
does
not
qualify
for
capital
gains.
the
congressional
purpose
on
it
was
to
exclude
from
these
burdens
of
the
surcharge,
the
proceeds
from
the
conversion
of
capital
asset
property.
any
other
transaction
does
not
fall
within
the
capital
gains
provisions.
now,
we
are
concerned
here
with
an
oil
payment.
it's
also
called
an
in-oil
payment,
a
production
payment,
a
mineral
payment
and
sometimes
unlimited
royalty.
the
definition
of
it
is
that
it
is
a
right
of
limited
duration,
carved
out
of
the
larger
interest
to
a
specified
sum
of
money
or
specified
number
of
barrels
of
oil
payable
out
of
the
stipulated
portion
of
the
oil
or
the
oil
proceeds.
now,
that's
a
complicated
definition
and
in
order
to
put
this
transaction
in
its
proper
perspective,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
moment
in
describing
very
briefly
the
method
by
which
oil
properties
are
developed
in
the
united
states.
we
start
off
with
the
lease
owner
--
with
the
land
owner
who
owns
the
minerals
under
the
property.
he
executes
a
lease
and
he
retains
an
interest
in
the
production
of
those
minerals
for
the
duration
of
a
lease.
it's
usually
an
eighth
interest
and
it's
called
a
royalty.
the
seven-eighths
interest
which
is
attained
by
the
lessee
is
called
the
working
interest.
that
has
all
the
burdens
of
production,
operation
of
the
lease.
if
this
is
a
particular
attractive
lease,
there
maybe
a
cash
payment
laid
by
the
lessee
to
the
lessor
that
is
called
bonus.
if
the
lessee
cannot
develop
the
property
or
is
unwilling
to
and
doesn't
want
the
lease
to
expire,
he
may
form
it
out
by
a
formal
agreement
which
is
in
effect
a
sublease.
if
he
retains
an
interest
in
that
property
which
he
does
in
the
case
of
a
sublease,
it's
called
an
overriding
royalty.
so,
we're
concerned
here
with
terms
such
as
royalty,
overriding
royalty,
working
interest
and
cash
bonus.
now,
i'd
like
to
give
an
illustration
of
how
an
oil
payment
works.
suppose
i
own
an
eighth
royalty,
the
oil
applicable
to
that
royalty,
i
can
tell
pretty
well
is
--
will
be
1000
barrels.
the
whole
deposit
is
about
8000
barrels
in
the
ground.
now,
i
know
that
the
amount
received
for
that
will
vary
somewhat
with
the
price
of
oil.
the
price
of
oil
in
these
taxes
at
the
moment
is
about
--
the
well
had
is
about
$3
a
barrel.
so,
i
can
be
pretty
sure
that
i
have
about
$3000
worth
of
oil
in
the
ground.
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
engineering
surveys
and
can
tell
pretty
accurately
how
much
the
recoverable
reserves
are,
your
honor.
and
with
the
price
of
oil,
i
can
look
back
for
the
past
20
years
and
see
that
if
it
has
been
increasing
along
with
prices
generally.
at
the
time
of
the
sewers
crisis,
of
course
the
price
of
oil
goes
up
and
at
this
moment
i
understand,
it's
a
little
bit
off.
it's
down
to
about
$3
or
$7.
so,
i
can
pretty
well
tell
how
much
my
oil
is
worth
on
the
ground.
i
do
--
i
would
have
a
little
trouble
perhaps
in
telling
you
exactly
how
long
it
will
take
to
profit,
because
the
regulatory
commission
such
as
the
texas
railroad
commission,
set
the
allowable
which
now
that
oil
has
somewhat
dwell
on
the
market
or
down
to
9
or
10
days.
they
have
been
up
as
high
as
20,
but
i
can
tell
by
looking
back
over
a
period
of
years
that
the
chances
are
that
this
oil
will
be
pumped
out
of
here
in
10
years,
which
means
i
would
make
--
i
would
have
a
hundred
barrels
of
oil
every
year
for
10
years
on
which
i
would
receive
$300
from
the
pipeline
company
that
purchases
the
oil.
that
$300
that
comes
in
every
year
will
be
taxed
to
me
as
ordinary
income,
subject
of
course
to
the
depletion
allowance.
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
on
oil
is
27.5%.
that
means
that
every
$100
i
get
from
the
pipeline
company,
i
will
exclude
$27.50
for
my
income
before
i
put
it
in
my
return
and
pay
the
tax
on
it.
sulphur
has
a
depletion
allowance
of
only
23%.
now,
i
might
say
that
this
production
of
the
oil
since
this
is
my
investment,
is
a
capital
gains
transaction
that
every
time
i
sell
a
barrel
of
oil,
it's
a
capital
gain
to
me,
but
this
court
decided
in
1932
that
that
just
wasn't
so
because
the
production
of
oil
is
like
a
business.
it's
like
a
manufacturing
business
and
you
get
your
basics
back
through
the
depletion.
now,
suppose
i'm
not
satisfied
with
this
percentage
depletion
that
i'm
getting
each
year,
what
i
want
is
a
capital
gain
because
i
have
to
save
more
taxes
on
a
capital
gain
than
i
can
through
percentage
depletion.
so,
what
can
i
do?i
got
this
royalty
interest.
i
know
it's
going
to
produce
$300
a
year
to
me
for
probably
the
next
10
years,
at
least.
well,
i
can
sell
my
entire
interest
and
if
i'm
not
a
dealer,
that
is
if
i'm
not
in
a
business
of
selling
interest
in
oil
and
gas,
i
can
get
a
capital
gain
on
that,
but
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
i
don't
want
to
get
out
of
this
thing
completely.
what
i
want
to
do
is
stay
in.
the
reason
i
want
to
stay
in
is
because
of
course
every
year,
the
engineers
are
getting
better
and
getting
more
oil
out
of
these
deposits,
so
they
use
gas
injection,
water
flooding
and
all
the
other
things.
mr.
john
n.
stull
may
it
please
the
court.
where
i
stopped
i
--
in
this
hypothetical
example
of
mine,
i
was
sitting
back
with
my
royalty
receiving
$300
a
year
taxable
to
me
as
ordinary
income
with
27.5%
--
percentage
depletion
tax
free
to
me
off
the
top.
of
course
the
capital
gain
was
a
lot
better
because
instead
of
deducting
27.5%
off
the
top,
they
deduct
50%
and
the
highest
tax
rate
is
only
25%.
now,
i
could
have
realized
a
capital
gain
by
getting
out
of
this
deal
completely
and
selling
out
my
interest
but
i
don't
want
to
because
this
interest
maybe
more
valuable
than
even
the
engineers
say
now
that
maybe
that
through
these
new
methods
of
gas
injection,
and
water
flooding,
and
so
on,
that
instead
of
a
thousand
barrels,
that
royalty
may
produce
actually
before
the
field
is
exhausted
perhaps
1500
barrels.
furthermore,
texas
is
a
prolific
state
and
it
may
be
that
when
this
field
is
about
exhausted,
somebody
will
come
along
and
draw
much
deeper
and
hit
a
whole
new
oil
bearing
sand.
in
that
case
i
might
discover
that
i've
got
10,000
additional
barrels
applicable
to
this
royalty.
so
i'm
in
a
dilemma.
i
want
a
capital
gain
but
i
want
to
stay
in.
i
want
to
get
out
but
only
out
enough
to
get
a
capital
gain.
so
what
i
do
is
use
this
device
called
the
carved
out
oil
payment.
now
to
return
to
my
example,
i
think
i'll
get
$300
a
year
every
year
for
10
years.
i
go
around
to
x
who
is
financially
responsible
or
otherwise
men.
if
he's
not
responsible,
he
can
probably
borrow
the
money
because
this
is
a
good
field
and
i
tell
him
that
for
$580
cash
that
he'll
give
me
$580
cash,
i
will
assign
to
you
x
an
oil
payment
which
means
that
the
--
while
this
oil
payment
is
in
effect,
the
pipeline
company
that
is
purchasing
the
oil
and
was
sending
those
checks
to
me,
monthly
checks,
as
this
oil
was
being
produced,
we'll
now
send
those
checks
to
you.
i've
got
$580
cash.
you
will
receive
those
checks
until
you've
received
enough
--
enough
checks
to
make
$600
plus
interest
of
4%,
we
say.
i'm
certainly
sure
--
i'm
reasonably
sure
that
this
will
pay
out
on
a
little
over
two
years,
$600
plus
whatever
the
interest
is.
now
the
mechanics
of
this,
the
assignment
is
carried
out
by
a
formidable
looking
document
by
which
i
grant
bargain,
sell,
transfer,
assign,
and
convert
my
royalty
interest
to
x
until
he
has
received
$600
plus
4%
interest.
thereafter,
that
assigned
interest
--
interest
according
to
this
instrument,
terminates
and
the
royalty
reverts
and
revests
in
me.
its
sign,
sealed,
delivered,
and
recorded.
because
it's
recorded,
the
pipeline
company
purchasing
the
oil
stopped
sending
me
the
checks
and
sends
them
to
my
friend
x
until
this
temporary
assignment
terminates.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
your
honor,
i'm
honestly
not
exaggerating.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
your
honor
let
me
--
may
i
give
you
the
facts
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
is,
in
essence,
these
transactions.
now
it
maybe
that
x
will
give
his
note
to
a
bank
and
go
out
and
borrow
the
money,
but
all
he
has
done
is
pay
me
cash
and
i
assigned
to
him
this
oil
payment.
and
i
would
like
to
--
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
facts
of
all
these
cases
because
they're
pretty
much
the
same.
what
i
would
like
to
go
into,
two
of
them,
to
illustrate
that
i'm
not
exaggerating
this
particular
transaction.
let's
take
the
o'connor
case.
this
came
up
from
the
district
court.
in
that
case,
the
estate
owned
eight
royalty
interests.
it
was
reasonably
estimated
that
the
reserves
of
oil
applicable
to
those
eight
interests
were
23,150,000
barrels.
the
estate
transferred
to
one
blackburn
a
$10
million
oil
payment
carved
out
of
this
--
these
royalty
interests.
the
consideration
paid
for
this
$10
million
oil
payment
was
$9,990,350
plus
4%
interest.
apparently,
mr.
blackburn
didn't
have
that
much
money
so
he
borrowed
it
from
the
chase
bank
in
new
york.
they
sent
their
engineers
down
and
decided
to
have
plenty
of
reserves
to
cover
the
pay
out
of
this.
he
borrowed
a
3.5%
interest.
so
everybody
was
happy
on
this
transfer.
mr.
blackburn
got
$9650
which
was
the
difference
between
the
$10
million
oil
payment
and
the
amount
he
paid
$9,990,350,
and
he
also
got
a
half
of
percent
interest
which
was
during
this
pay
out,
which
was
the
difference
between
what
he
paid
the
chase
bank
and
what
the
estate
paid
him.
now
at
the
time
of
that
transfer,
it
could
be
reasonably
estimated
and
it
shows
in
the
record,
that
about
4
million
barrels
would
be
required
to
pay
out
that
oil
payment.
that
is
about
17%
of
the
reserves
and
after
he
paid
out,
there
would
be
$19,150,000
barrels
left.
that
oil
payment
paid
out
in
three
years.
after
the
three-year
pay
out,
the
pipeline
company
again
started
sending
those
checks
to
the
estate
or
to
the
beneficiaries
if
they
were
distributed
just
as
they
had
been
sending
them
to
the
estate
before
this
assignment
was
made.
mr.
john
n.
stull
as
a
capital
gain,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
the
commissioner
said
that
--
that
$9,990,000
was
taxable
as
ordinary
income
subject
to
depletion.
the
depletion
deduction
allowed
on
that
was
$2,750,000
of
barrels
or
a
little
less
than
that.
and
the
rest
was
taxed
at
ordinary
income
rates.
the
tax
levied
by
the
commissioner
was
about
$5,600,000.
a
claim
for
refund
was
made
and
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
that
was
a
capital
gains
transaction
and
the
$2,000,000
odd
difference
in
tax
was
refunded.
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
consideration
sir?
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
the
tax
was
paid
and
collected
in
one
year.
yes,
sir.
because
this
transaction
was
a
one
year
transaction.
it
was
an
assignment
then
they
got
the
money.
it
was
theirs
to
do
whatever
they
wanted
to
so
there's
just
one
transaction.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
they
can.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
think
all
of
these
are
cash,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
the
money
is
some
sort
of
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
now
the
facts
on
the
p.g.
lake
case
are
their
corporation,
p.g.
lake,
inc.
was
indebted
to
its
president,
p.g.
lake
for
$600,000.
this
corporation
was
engaged
in
a
business
of
producing
oil
and
gas,
developing
oil
and
gas
property
from
which
it
realized
ordinary
income
subject
to
depletion
and
on
the
seven-eighths
working
interest
on
producing
leases.
now
the
usual
way
of
paying
back
that
debt
would
be
that
this
ordinary
income
would
come
in,
depletion
at
27.5%
would
be
taken
off
the
top,
corporate
tax
paid
on
the
remainder,
and
use
the
depletion
tax
free
plus
what's
left
over
after
the
tax
and
the
rest
of
it
can
pay
off
the
note.
but
p.g.
lake,
inc.
assigned
to
p.g.
lake
an
oil
payment
for
$600,000
plus
3%
interest.
now,
since
this
was
a
working
interest
that
the
corporation
owned,
they
could
not
assign
as
the
o'connor
estate
did
the
complete
royalties.
because
that,
the
working
interest
has
to
pay
the
expenses
of
production.
and
furthermore,
i
suppose
that
they
didn't
want
to
assign
too
much
because
they
didn't
want
to
run
into
the
limitation
on
percentage
depletion.
percentage
depletion
is
27.5%
of
the
gross
but
it's
limited
to
50%
of
the
net.
and
if
they
cut
off
too
much
of
their
income,
they
might
have
their
expenses
come
up
and
cut
down
the
percentage
depletion.
so
what
they
did
was
make
this
oil
payment
payable
out
of
only
25%
of
the
seven-eighths
working
interest.
in
other
words,
they
kept
the
other
75%
of
the
working
interest,
got
all
the
income
from
it
but
they
assigned
for
this
oil
payment
--
carved
out
oil
payment
transaction
25%
of
that
working
interest.
now,
at
the
time
of
that
assignment
if
it
would
be
reasonably
estimated
that
the
oil
payment
would
pay
out
in
about
three
years,
and
it
did
pay
out
in
about
three
years.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
taxpayers
claim
here
that
this
lump
sum
consideration
received
for
these
assignments
qualifies
for
the
preferred
treatment
of
117
of
the
internal
revenue
code
just
won't
stand
analysis.
under
the
ordinary
principles
of
income
tax
law
without
putting
aside
for
the
moment
some
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
tax
law
of
oil
and
gas
interests,
we
think
that
this
was
merely
anticipating
income
that
what
the
transaction
was
that
the
taxpayers
own
these
mineral
interests.
they
were
receiving
the
checks.
they
had
been
receiving
them
from
the
pipeline
companies.
they
had
been
reporting
them
as
ordinary
income
for
a
good
many
years
for
some
of
these
cases.
they
were
doing
it
at
that
time
and
they
could
reasonably
expect
that
that
would
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
question
on
the
(inaudible)
cases
about
that
your
honor,
but
that
wasn't
argued
there
and
it's
not
being
argued
here.
and
i
believe
on
the
o'connor
brief,
that
was
admitted
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
on
that
point.
mr.
john
n.
stull
(inaudible)
mr.
john
n.
stull
(inaudible)
yes,
sir.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
the
result
of
this
is
that
for
a
short
period
of
time,
transferee
(inaudible)
these
rights,
became
entitled
to
collect
the
ordinary
income
which
otherwise
the
transferor
would
have
collected.
and
that
merely
because
of
these
temporary
assignments,
a
capital
gain
is
not
realized.
this
is
not
the
type
of
transaction
that
comes
within
section
117.
section
117
does
not
cover
assignments
of
income.
now
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
i'd
say
on
that
--
on
that
situation,
sir,
it
would
be
out
of
luck
but
when
you
borrow
nine
--
almost
$10,000,000
from
the
chase
bank,
they
send
their
engineers
down
there
and
they
don't
make
the
loan
unless
they're
doing
well
as
the
estimates
are
under
conservative
side.
so
i
don't
--
i've
never
heard
of
any
of
these
oil
payments
running
out.
maybe
some
of
the
taxpayers,
counsel
here
from
taxes
know
more
about
it
than
i
do.
know
about
it.
now
we
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
this
is
nothing
but
an
assignment
of
income.
for
instance,
in
the
horst
case,
decided
by
this
court
in
1941,
the
taxpayer
leased
a
building
and
the
lease
had
eight
years
to
run.
in
consideration
for
cancellation
of
that
lease,
he
received
a
lump
sum.
he
claimed
it
was
a
capital
gain.
this
court
said
no.
that
that
was
merely
in
lieu
of
the
ordinary
rent
which
he
would
have
collected
year
after
year
over
the
rest
of
the
term
of
the
lease.
we
think
that's
just
the
same
thing
here,
that
this
lump
sum
cash
payment
is
just
the
same
thing.
it's
in
lieu
of
the
ordinary
royalty
income
subject
to
depletion.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
on
these
payments,
the
commissioner
does
consider,
thus
get
depletion
deduction
of
all
these
taxes
of
the
oil
payment
assignments.
now,
another
analogy
in
the
regular
law
without
going
to
the
oil
and
gas
law,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
watson
case
where
this
court
held
that
in
1953
that
the
sale
of
an
orchard,
an
orange
grove
with
unmatured
crops
on
the
trees.
in
that
situation,
part
of
that
sales
price
had
to
be
allocated
to
the
crops.
and
therefore,
it
was
taxable
as
ordinary
income
just
as
if
the
seller
had
kept
the
groves
a
little
longer,
picked
the
fruit,
and
sold
it
in
one
lump
sum
for
over
a
period
time
himself.
well
the
taxpayers
here
say
that
that
type
of
case
doesn't
apply
here
because
they've
got
oil,
oils
of
peculiar
animal.
oil
is
both
capital
and
its
income.
well,
we
can't
say
that
that's
a
valid
distinction
because
oil,
when
it's
sold,
you
get
a
depletion
allowance
on
it.
that
takes
care
of
you
capital.
the
only
thing
left
is
income.
the
commissioner
has
given
these
taxpayers
their
depletion
allowance.
they're
not
being
taxed
on
their
capital.
all
they
did
was
assign
their
income.
now
i
would
like
for
a
minute
to
turn
to
some
of
these
oil
cases.
going
back
to
that
original
leasing
transaction
i
discuss
at
the
outset,
if
you
remember
we
had
the
landowner
entering
into
a
lease.
he
retained
the
one-eighth
royalty,
seven-eighth
of
it
was
working
interest
and
he
received
a
cash
bonus.
now
that
exact
situation
was
before
this
court
in
1932
in
burnet
against
harmel.
the
question
there
was
whether
there
had
been
a
sale
of
the
oil
and
gas
in
place
to
the
purchaser,
the
lessee
in
that
case.
if
there
had
been
a
sale,
this
bonus,
this
cash
bonus
would
have
been
taxed
as
capital
gain,
but
this
court
held
otherwise.
they
said
that,
“yes,
we
can
look
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
texas,”
and
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
texas,
we
admit
that
this
--
this
leasing
transaction
actually
convey
title
to
all
the
minerals
in
place
to
the
lessee.
that
this
circuit,
just
as
they
did
in
this
case,
held
in
harmel
that
because
under
state
law,
all
right,
title
and
interest
to
the
minerals
went
to
the
lessee.
it
was
therefore
a
capital
transaction
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
and
the
bonus
was
taxed
as
capital
gain.
this
court
disagreed.
it
said
that
we
have
to
look
to
state
law
to
determine
the
interest
to
the
party
but
we
look
to
the
federal
income
tax
statutes
and
the
statute
there
was
a
predecessor
of
section
117
with
which
we're
concerned
here.
and
they
said
that
under
that
it
was
not
intended
by
congress
that
a
transaction
such
as
this
should
result
in
capital
gain.
further
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
palmer
against
bender
which
involved
a
bonus
in
a
subleasing
transaction,
pointed
out
that
this
lump
sum
bonus
consideration
was
merely
a
substitute
for
and
in
lieu
of
ordinary
income,
ordinary
royalty
income
which
would
be
received
by
the
taxpayers
over
a
period
of
years,
it
was
really
an
anticipation
of
that
income.
therefore,
it
was
of
exactly
the
same
type
of
that
income
and
taxable
exactly
of
that
income
would
have
been
taxed
when
it
was
received.
the
court
specifically
stated
that
the
bonus
was
a
return
pro
tanto
of
the
plaintiff's
capital
investment
in
the
oil
in
anticipation
of
its
extraction.
now,
we
think
that
exactly
the
same
thing
applied
here.
what
we
have
is
a
taxpayer
within
continuing
economic
interest
in
the
minerals
in
place,
a
royalty,
overriding
royalty,
a
working
interest
whatever
it
is.
what
he
does
is
sell
in
anticipation
that
is
in
anticipation
of
what
he
will
receive
as
ordinary
income.
part
of
that
ordinary
income
for
a
lump
sum
consideration
just
as
the
lessor
in
harmel
did.
we
think
that
those
principles
are
exactly
applicable
here.
we
can't
find
any
distinction
between
those
two
cases
at
all.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
your
honor,
i
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
it
is
just
selling
--
if
my
reserves
are
thousand
barrels,
and
i
sell
hundred
barrels
instead
of
making
an
assignment
for
$300,
if
i
just
transfer
hundred
barrels
and
he's
got
to
go
to
the
well
and
get
it
up
and
sell
rather
than
collect
the
pipe
--
the
checks
from
the
pipeline,
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
possible
difference.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
is
entirely
different,
sir,
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
capital
gains
transaction,
because
as
to
that
part,
i'm
completely
out.
i
chopped
that
part
off.
it
isn't
one
of
these
--
i'm
now
out
--
i'm
now
completely
back
in
situation.
and
i
think
that
the
depletion
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
all
the
way
up
to
the
burton-sutton
oil
company
in
1945
show
that
--
that
when
you
keep
a
continuing
economic
interest
in
that
property,
then
it
is
not
a
capital
transaction,
it
is
merely
a
sublease
or
burton-sutton
was
net
profit.
i
don't
know
what
you
call
that
type
of
arrangement.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
in
cash
or
in-kind
because
when
i
sell
it
in
cash
it
just
means
that
somebody
else
is
lifting
the
oil,
but
if
i
sell
it
in-kind,
it
means
that
this
fellow
has
to
go
out
and
lifted
himself,
and
of
course
there
would
be
expenses
allocable
to
that
and
i
would
assume
that
he
would
be
given
some
sort
of
a
consideration
for
the
estimated
cost
of
lifting
that
oil.
so
we
probably
wouldn't
tax
--
tax
him
on
the
complete
amount
which
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes.
mr.
john
n.
stull
out
of
that
royalty
interest.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
it
says,
as
long
as
there
is
--
it's
just
a
temporary
assignment
as
long
as
it
isn't
a
part,
fractional
part
of
your
royalty
for
the
rest
of
the
life
of
the
properties,
we
say
it's
just
a
temporary
assignment
of
income.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no,
sir,
because
you've
limited
it.
if
you
assign
one-fifth
of
your
entire
interest
in
whatever
maybe
down
there
because
as
i
pointed
out
before,
there
maybe
a
lot
more
down
there
than
the
best
engineers
know
right
now.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
say
that'd
be
ordinary
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
ordinary
income
if
i
understand
this
correctly.
if
it's
an
undivided
interest
that
goes
throughout
the
life
of
the
property,
maybe
you
think
it's
a
hundred
--
hundred
barrels
in
there,
it
maybe
more
or
less.
but
if
you
--
if
the
risk
is
put
on
the
person
who
purchases
it
as
to
how
much
is
in
there
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
capital
gain,
yes
sir.
now,
finally,
i
think
that
it's
pretty
clear
that
section
117
requires
the
sale
of
property.
we
think
that
the
only
property
that
possibly
had
been
sold
here
was
either
an
assignment
of
income
which
obviously
is
in
property,
an
anticipation
of
future
income
or
an
assignment
of
a
mere
contractual
rate
to
collect
from
the
pipeline
company,
income
in
the
future
which
otherwise
i
would
have
collected.
neither
of
this
we
think
is
property
under
section
117.
we
don't
believe
that
congress
ever
intended
that
this
type
of
transaction
fall
within
section
117.
now,
the
taxpayers
here
extraneously
argue
that
this
court
should
take
a
different
approach
to
this.
they
should
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
it's
substantial
or
insubstantial.
if
one
of
these
assignments
is
a
substantial
part
of
their
interest,
then,
we
should
say
capital
gain.
if
it's
insubstantial,
we
should
say
ordinary
income.
o'connor
came
up
from
the
district
court
and
there's
a
finding
there
that
17%
of
the
reserves
paying
out
in
three
years
is
substantial.
we
don't
agree
that
this
is
a
correct
approach
but
even
if
it
is,
we
still
think
that
the
oil
payments
here
are
insubstantial.
there
is
missing
from
the
record
in
the
fleming
case,
the
estimated
reserves.
so
perhaps
if
it
come
--
came
down
to
a
question
of
fact,
we'd
have
to
find
out
about
those.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
court
ever
need
reach
this
substantial
business.
we
think
our
first
two
arguments
completely
answer
any
argument
that
the
taxpayers
made.
furthermore,
if
you
get
into
the
substantial
versus
insubstantial
business,
we
think
it's
almost
impossible
to
administer
because
that
oil
is
under
the
branch,
you
can't
get
down
and
see
it.
you
just
have
to
take
the
best
engineering
estimates.
they're
pretty
accurate
but
they're
usually
conservative.
furthermore,
we
may
have
hit
another
sand
down
there
and
get
a
lot
more
oil.
so
what's
insubstantial
today
or
what
is
substantial
today
may
very
well
be
insubstantial
tomorrow.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
tax
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
the
state
law
and
said,
“this
is
a
fine
instrument,
it's
been
recorded,
the
title
of
the
oil
passed
under
texas
law,”
and
without
analyzing
burnet
against
harmel
and
the
other
depletion
cases
decided
by
this
court,
they
passed
it
off
as
a
capital
transaction.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes,
sir.
most
of
these
are
just
been
litigated
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
i
assume
under
these
instruments,
i
think
that
an
oil
payment
under
texas
law
and
i
can
be
corrected
on
this,
it's
considered
real
estate
under
texas
law.
now,
the
taxpayers
have
a
claim
of
a
foul
here.
they
say
that
the
commissioner
applied
this
--
these
deficiencies
retroactively.
it
seems
to
me
we've
been
through
all
these,
the
automobile
club
case
but
some
of
them
still
seem
to
push
it.
all
these
transactions
--
the
earliest
of
these
transactions
was
in
december
of
1947.
the
first
published
ruling
that
i
know
about
as
to
the
taxation
of
these
oil
payments
occurred
in
1946
in
which
the
general
--
the
general
counsel
of
this
treasury
published
a
gcm
in
which
he
said
that
short
lives
oil
payments
were
not
qualified
as
capital
assets.
he
said
ordinarily
these
are
one
or
two
years.
from
this,
these
taxpayers
argue
that
in
the
weed
case,
this
thing
paid
out
in
two
years
and
four
months.
they
say
this
gcm
said
one
or
two
years
so
they
didn't
catch
us.
some
of
the
others
paid
out
in
three
years,
others
paid
out
in
four
and
five.
of
course,
the
payout
period
doesn't
mean
very
much
because
if
you
always
sign
a
very
small
part
of
your
interest,
it
will
take
a
much
longer
time
to
pay
out
than
if
you're
in
a
position
to
assign
your
whole
interest
for
a
much
shorter
time.
anyway,
that
ruling
on
which
they
relied
specifically
stated,
that
no
opinion
is
expressed
with
respect
to
the
status
of
oil
payments
extending
over
a
substantial
portion
of
the
depletable
interest
from
which
product.
i
think
that
any
taxpayer
who
relied
on
that
and
now
claims
a
foul
was
a
little
out
of
line
on
relying
on
that
particular
assignment.
in
1950,
the
commissioner
again
ruled
that
the
experience
from
46
to
50,
it
showed
that
there
was
no
possible
basis
to
figure
out
the
difference
between
a
short-lived
and
--
and
a
long-lived
oil
payment.
so
therefore
he
was
going
to
give
up
any
idea
and
he
had
expressed
from
the
first
that
there
might
be
possibly
later
on
come
out
with
some
idea
of
a
distinction
between
them.
now
i
stated
at
the
beginning
that
there
is
another
question
involved
in
the
fleming
case.
in
the
fleming
case,
these
assignments
were
not
laid
for
cash.
they
were
made
for
real
estate.
we
think
that
it's
impossible
to
distinguish
between
cash
and
real
estate
in
this
situation.
but
the
taxpayers
say
that
this
is
a
tax-free
exchange
under
section
112
(b)
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
quoted
on
pages
54
and
55
of
our
brief.
that
says
that
no
gain
or
loss
should
be
recognized
if
property
held
for
productive
use
in
the
trade
or
business
or
for
investment
not
including
the
stock
and
trade
or
other
property
held
primarily
for
sale.
it's
exchange
solely
for
property
of
a
light
count
to
be
held
either
for
productive
use
and
trade
or
business
or
for
investment.
now
we
can't
see
that
this
oil
payment
is
that
type
of
property
in
that
statute
anymore
than
its
property
under
section
117.
we
think
that
the
oil
payment
is
merely
an
assignment
of
income.
it's
an
anticipatory
assignment
of
income.
therefore,
it
can't
be
like
property
to
an
office
building
in
fort
worth
or
a
ranch
out
in
texas
somewhere.
in
conclusion,
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
think
that
these
devices,
while
they
maybe
well
recognized
under
the
law
of
texas,
i
realize
that
there
are
other
situations
where
the
oil
payment
has
a
use
in
the
oil
industry.
i
won't
get
in
to
that.
we're
not
attacking
that
particular
type,
we're
attacking
a
carved
out
oil
payment
which
is
carved
out
temporarily
from
a
larger
interest
which
interest
is
retained
by
the
assignor
whether
he
goes
through
the
mechanics
of
assigning
it
to
the
assignee
with
the
reversion
back
or
whether
he
just
carves
out
a
partial
interest
in
it
and
really
keeps
it
himself.
we
don't
think
that
that
makes
any
difference.
mr.
john
n.
stull
may
it
please
the
court.
i
seem
to
have
had
a
failure
of
memory.
we're
not
quite
as
badly
off
in
the
lower
courts
as
i
led
the
court
to
believe.
the
first
time
we
were
down
there
recently
in
the
hawn
case,
we
want
to
--
apparently
even
the
fifth
circuit
wouldn't
go
along
with
the
transfer
of
an
oil
payment
as
a
capital
gain
transaction
where
it
was
given
to
somebody
to
build
the
owner
a
house.
then
when
we
went
down
in
the
caldwell
case,
we
had
the
hawn
case
distinguished
away
but
judge
reeves
is
on
our
side.
the
tax
court
has
gone
along
with
caldwell
rather
than
hawn
in
any
of
those
cases.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
stull
six?
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
oil
--
the
only
other
thing
i
have
to
say
is
that
i
haven't
heard
any
answer
to
our
harmel
argument
that
this
is
just
exactly
like
the
harmel
case.
this
depletion
argument
--
depletion,
the
southwest
exploration
decision
of
this
court
said
that
the
depletion
was
to
take
care
of
returning
to
the
owner
of
one
of
these
economic
interests
as
capital
investment.
we're
not
trying
to
tax
depletion,
to
tax
that
capital
investment.that's
exactly
what
this
allowance
is
for.
as
far
as
the
oil
in
kind
goes,
i
--
i
had
not
experience
with
these
oil
deals
to
know
that
every
oil
deal
allows
every
participant
to
get
his
oil
in
kind
if
he
wants
it.
i
don't
think
anybody
ever
gets.
a
barrel
of
crude
oil
in
new
york
is
pretty
hard
to
dispose
of.
what
happened
here
is
whether
there's
a
right
to
the
oil
in
kind
or
whether
it's
a
cash.
it
is
that
there
was
a
cash
came
in
and
cash
was
paid
to
the
pipeline.
and
the
harmel
case
said
that
the
texas
oil
lease
conveyed
the
right
to
the
oil
and
gas.
that's
true.
but
they
said
that
is
not
a
capital
gains
transaction.
well
that
right
is
conveyed
at
the
wellhead
or
was
conveyed
in
the
grounds
and
not
a
capital
gains
transaction.
and
therefore,
they
said
that
that
bonus
was
taxable
as
ordinary
income.
it
wasn't
a
capital
transaction.
