are
you
--
did
the
board
--
i
ought
to
know,
but
i
don't.
i
ought
to
appreciate
it.
did
the
board
in
these
two
cases
make
a
general
rule
to
the
effect
that
the
employer
may
use
his
plant
premises,
for
saying
what
he's
allowed
to
say,
otherwise.
and
at
the
same
time
quite
unequivocally
restrict
the
employee
to
another
available,
practically
available
forum
or
locals
of
communication.
is
that
--
is
that
what
i'm
supposed
to
take
out
of
these
two
cases
if
the
rule
of
the
court
--
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
--
this
problem
only
arises
in
plants
which
either
are
not
unionized,
or
in
which
there
is
a
contest
between,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
in
the
writings
of
the
board,
no
account
is
taken
of
the
inevitable
or
the
argumentative
friction
there
arise
in
having
that
debate,
joining
the
union
or
not
joining
a
union,
joining
this
union
as
against
that
union,
or
leaving
this
union
and
going
to
that
union,
whether
that
is
not
a
factor
that
the
--
board
has
considered,
or
is
that
included
among
the
items
of
what
does
or
does
not
we
sought
as
production.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
non-working
time,
working
time,
how
about
working
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
contention
that
we
cannot
look
back
of
the
court's
finding
under
those
circumstances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
do
you
regard
this
as
a
case
coming
under
our
universal
camera
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
supposed
it
was
suggested
to
you
that
what
the
court
--
what
the
board
has
done
is
to
divide
the
rule
of
law
from
the
fact
that
it
found.
what
would
you
say
to
that?
and
therefore,
what
is
in
question
is,
the
rule
of
law
that
when
coercion
been
established
to
working
time
talk,
that
--
that
--
as
it
were,
vitiates
the
whole
restrictions
of
--
upon
the
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
would
go
to
the
merits,
but
i'm
--
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
--
holds
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
board
insist
that
in
the
steel
case,
nutone,
these
were
non-coercive
use
expressed
by
the
employees.
justice

i'm
not
(inaudible)
that
the
(voice

--
justice

--
is
erroneous
of
that.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
the
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
the
employer's
to
be
--
in
the
board's
findings,
did
it
find
that
the
manner
in
which
it
availed
itself
of
talk
using
it's
own
word,
was
not
a
anti-labor
practice.
justice

yes.
justice

(voice

justice

all
right.
justice

if
what
--

justice

yes.
justice

are
you
going

say
a

about
the
chief
contention
that
--
what's
the

avondale

merely
an

i
don't

make
any

further.
i
just
accept
it

are
you

invalidate,
he

permit

justice

before

you
still
have

would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
conceive

of
american

of

the

played

field.
justice

(inaudible)

i
didn't

you.
justice

when
you

in

did

did
any
report

actually
referred

justice

have
you
read
the

the
matter
here.
justice

all
right.
justice

may
i
--
may
i
just
ask
you,
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
of
information,
a
brief
may
be
filed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
its
own
legal
authority

--
justice

--
they
are
not
prerequisite
of
statements
if
he
--
he
was
to
give
no
objection
so
far
even
though
he
may
not
agree?
what
is
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
don't
take
your
time
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
use
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
whether
it
is
the
practice
of
the
board
not
to
take
note
of
--
of
a
restrictive
rule
which
it
would
strike
down
if
challenged,
when
the
whole
question
of
accessibility
to
information
is
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly
or
you
can
just
put
it,
secondly,
--
refresh
my
recollection,
there's
no
provision
or
is
there
that
the
question
is
not
raised
before
the
board,
can't
be
raised
later
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
statute
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
is
not
open
here
as
i
assume
that's
well
--
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
my
first
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
party
is
a
well-instructed
organization
like
the
steel
workers
or
less
well-instructed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
a
difference
that
the
party
in
this
case
can
be
presumed
to
be
looking
out
for
itself
with
all
the
able
counsel
they
have
and
you
--
you
need
not
to
vouch
for
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
question
in
your
mind
that
if
employer
doesn't
use
--
utilize
its
premises
for
discrimination,
that
the
rules
could
forbid
the
employees
from
doing
what
is
here
sought
to
be
prevented?
justice

frankfurter
but
i
mean,
is
there
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
not
my
question,
mr.
feller.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
want
the
question
to
be
a
little
pebble
to
be
thrown
into
a
big
pond.
i
want
to
know,
assuming
that
i
think
it's
relevant,
i
may
be
wrong
about
that.
you
have
the
right
to
say
that's
irrelevant.
assuming
that
i
may
relevantly
take
into
account
the
answer
to
my
question
for
myself
whether
this
conduct
by
the
employees,
as
such,
forget
about
the
employer.
there's
no
question
about
that,
whether
this
conduct
by
the
employees
as
such,
and
independently
raised
is
relevant
to
the
determination
of
this
question.
i
would
like
to
know,
if
you're
capable
of
stating,
whether
this
conduct
could
be
forbidden
by
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
--
this
--
the
very
thing
that
they
claim
here,
they
have
the
right
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
very
case,
this
very
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
saying
this
context.
mr.
feller,
you're
too
astute
not
to
follow
the
precise
limitations
of
my
question.
i'm
not
asking
you
whether
you
disagree
with
the
position
you're
taking.
i'm
asking
you
to
detach
the
question
that
is
in
controversy
here,
namely,
the
question
of
reciprocity.
if
you
take
the
conduct
that
the
employees
seek
to
assert
for
themselves,
not
in
this
context
as
such,
is
that
properly
to
be
outlawed
by
the
board
if
he
chooses
to
outlaw
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
does
the
law
permit
the
board
to
say,
the
management
can
forbid
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
i
ask,
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
could
show
before
the
board
that
it
wouldn't
litter
the
place
and
therefore
they
couldn't
forbid
it,
is
that
it?
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
of
course,
you're
arguing
this
case.
i'm
trying
to
analyze
the
problem
and
not
to
decide
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
it
merely
because
of
littering?
is
it
merely
because
of
littering?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
can
do
--
can
it
be
done
by
word
of
mouth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
--
can
there
be
dissemination,
done
by
word
of
mouth
so
there's
no
question
of
littering
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
general
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
if
you
say
that
if
you
--
can
you
--
can
you
prove
before
the
board
that
you'll
take
care
of
the
littering
problem,
that
you
will
have
a
fellow
accompanying
the
--
the
disseminated
to
pick
up
the
pieces?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
the
rule
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
that's
--
the
rule
is
limited
to
--
guarding
against
littering?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
law.
that
--
that's
what
you
regard
as
the
limitation
upon
such
a
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
now
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
--
an
employer
couldn't
deal
or
hold
exclusively
for
the
use
of
his
employees
entirely
for
their
disposition
in
which
so-called
dissemination
and
talk
and
propaganda
and
(inaudible)
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
trying
to
test
the
legal
justification
of
the
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
on
--
is
that
on
free
speech
constitutional
grounds?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question
mr.
feller?
partly
involves
something
that
you
might
well
refuse
to
answer.
could
congress
by
legislation
enact
the
rule
which
the
court
promulgated,
which
the
board
promulgated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state
it's
necessary
for
me
to
consider
it
in
view
of
the
breadth
of
implementing
powers
that
the
congress
has
given
the
board?
i'm
not
saying
it
has
substituted
the
board
for
itself
but
in
construing
the
breadth
for
which
we
recognize
in
a
series
of
cases
and
at
least
in
phelps
dodge
you
have
to
consider
what
the
breadth
of
remedial
powers
that
the
board
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fantastic
as
that.
my
question
is
whether
the
employer
may
do
this
if
he
leaves
opportunities
for
--
for
argumentation
elsewhere
than
outside
of
the
immediate
premises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
question
from
the
record
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hence
my
reservation
in
asking
it,
yes.because
if
--
if
this,
as
i
said,
when
one
deals
with
the
breadth
which
has
been
urged
down
this
court
and
which
i've
added
my
share
as
to
the
breadth
of
remedial
powers
that
are
left
with
the
board
to
carry
out
policy
one
has
a
very
different
story
and
the
answer
for
such
a
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
(voice

you
