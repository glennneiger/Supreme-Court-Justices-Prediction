mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
preliminarily
to
some
of
the
questions
which
my
brother
has
i
think
quite
appropriately
remarked
should
properly
be
addressed
to
me
rather
than
to
him.
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
union
request
in
this
case
to
distribute
literature
within
the
plant.
the
record,
i
may
say,
does
not
show
any
such
request.
the
reason
it
does
not
show
that
request,
i
think,
is
that
no
one
thought
it
was
relevant
to
this
proceeding
from
the
beginning.
i
think
anyone
with
any
knowledge
in
this
matter
would
know
that
when
a
union
is
outside
the
plant
distributing
literature,
particularly
distributing
it
through
non-employees
as
in
the
nature
of
the
case,
it
is
almost
required
to
do
if
it
distributes
outside
the
plant,
since
normally
the
employees,
if
there's
a
one-shift
operation
have
to
be
inside
the
plant
during
working
time.
they
can't
get
in
and
out
in
time
to
hand
things
out
at
the
gates.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
in
this
case
does
show
distribution
of
literature
by
the
three
employees
who
had
been
discharged
for
union
activity
and
by
union
organizing.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
shows
distribution
outside
the
plant
by
any
employees.
as
i
say,
it's
not
very
clear
on
that.
that
matter
came
in
with
reference
to
another
question.
that
is,
to
whether
certain
actions
which
these
three
employees
had
taken
while
they
were
distributing
this
literature
were
a
defense
against
the
reinstatement
order.
it
was
never
really,
there
was
never
in
the
--
before
the
trial
examiner
or
before
the
board
or
before
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
never
considered
relevant
that
the
union
had
distributed
literature
outside
the
plant
or
whether
employees
had.
nor
was
it
considered
relevant
whether
the
union
had
asked
to
distribute
literature
inside
the
plant.
as
i
said,
in
this
situation,
it
would
not
naturally
be
assumed.
it's
always
better
to
distribute
inside
the
plant
than
it
is
at
the
gates.
but
no
issue
was
joined
on
that
because
the
simple
issue
was
whether
an
employer
could
prohibit
such
distribution
and
effectively
prohibit
such
distribution,
i
--
in
the
face
of
a
request.
well,
that
was
assumed
and
not
--
not
tried
and
at
the
same
time
distribute
his
own
literature.
now,
the
board
in
deciding
that
case
did
not
base
its
position
on
any
consideration
of
equivalent
methods
of
distribution
by
the
union
or
--
or
on
consideration
as
to
whether
the
union
had
in
itself
requested.
the
board
had
a
simple
answer
to
this
case.
the
board
itself,
and
i
think
that
answer
is
what
is
really
an
issue,
and
that
was
what
was
litigated
throughout
this
case.
the
board
said,
and
i
am
reading
from
pages
45
to
46
of
the
record.
now,
the
first
--
a
reply
that
suggests
that
the
trial
examiner
had
said
and
the
board's
decision
quotes
his
finding
that
and
no
objection
was
made
to
that
finding
that
the
respondent
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
trial
examiner's
report
as
the
board
quoted
it,
on
page
45
of
the
record
that
the
respondent,
“broke
its
own
rules
by
campaigning
against
the
union
in
the
normal
arena
and
the
most
effective
one
for
reaching
the
employees
while
simultaneously
denying
access
to
it
by
the
union.”
now,
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
actually
evidence
that
the
union
had
requested
or
not
as
i
said
they
didn't
litigate
that
question
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
record.
but
the
trial
examiner's
conclusion
was
that
the
union
had
been
effectively
denied
access
to
that
--
to
that
form.
and
the
board's
answer
was
very
simple
and
it
continued
saying
it
disagree
with
the
trial
examiner
said,
“valid
plant
rules
against
solicitation
and
other
forms
of
union
activity
do
not
control
an
employer's
actions.
management
prerogative
certainly
extends
far
enough,
so
as
to
permit
an
employer
to
make
rules
that
do
not
bind
himself
otherwise
an
employer
can
only
enforce
a
rule
he
promulgates
so
long
as
he
conducts
himself
according
to
the
rule.”
and
that
was
the
simple
issue
which
the
board
decided.
and
i
think
that's
the
simple
issue
that
it
is
here.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said
that
it
disagreed
with
that
conclusion.
and
that
with
respect
to
the
plant
premises
and
we're
talking
about
the
plant
premise,
we're
not
talking
about
other
property,
as
your
honors
will
recall
in
stowe
spinning
where
the
question
was
whether
the
employer's
property
rights
in
other
property,
a
--
a
meeting
hall
to
which
they
denied
access
to
the
union
was
involved
which
the
court
made
a
distinction
between
the
plant
premises
and
other
employer
property.
the
real
basic
question
is,
not
with
respect
to
other
property
or
not
as
--
i
think
my
brother
has
referred
you
on
whether
the
union
is
to
be
given
access
to
this
property.
first
of
all,
it's
not
the
union
we're
talking
about.
let
me
make
that
very
clear.
it's
employees
we're
talking
about.
the
rule
with
respect
to
employees
and
union
representative
is
somewhat
different
at
least
since
this
court's
decision
in
babcock
&
wilcox
case.
we're
talking
about
employees
and
their
rights
and
we're
talking
about
the
plant
premises
where
they
work
and
it's
not
a
question
as
to
whether
the
employees
are
to
be
given
access
to
the
premises.
they
have
access.
they're
invited
there.
they're
told
that
they
have
a
duty
to
be
there
to
perform
their
work.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
employer
can,
with
respect
to
those
premises
say,
“you
cannot
do
thus
and
so
on
the
union
question
but
i
can
have
my
foreman
go
around
and
do
precisely,
thus
and
so.
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
did
not
contest
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
there
is
no
question.
whether
the
employer
can
or
not,
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
premises.
now,
in
our
brief
we've
set
forth
the
varying
set
of
rules
that
had
been
evolved
depending
on
one
consideration.
the
act
provides
that
the
employer
cannot
interfere
in
any
way
but
sensibly
construed
that
has
to
be
accommodated
on
the
fact
that
the
plant's
a
place
where
production
takes
place.
now,
the
distribution
rules
have
had
a
long
history
and
we
set
it
out
in
our
brief
of,
one
point
the
board
said
that
the
--
an
employer
could
not
prevent
the
distribution
of
literature.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
let
me
--
may
i
finish
the
answer
to
the
question?
mr.
david
e.
feller
as
of
the
present
moment,
the
board
says,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
serious
dispute
to
that.
that
in
the
interest
of
keeping
the
plant
clean
and
orderly
and
so
getting
production
done,
the
employer
can
establish
a
rule
that
you
can't
have,
hand
out
papers
during
working
--
or
during
working
hours
or
nonworking
hours.
but
otherwise
you
can't
operate
a
plant
officially.
so
there's
no
dispute
here
as
before
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
you
mean
distribution
of
literature,
your
honor?
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that
absent
discrimination,
the
very
conduct
itself
under
the
existing
board
rules
and
we
do
not
contest
those,
could
be
prohibited
by
the
employer.
mr.
david
e.
feller
not
in
this
context,
your
honor.
i
can't
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
it
is
properly
--
i
--
it
is
not
to
be
properly
outlawed
by
the
board.
i
think
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
the
--
the
law
permits
the
board
to
say,
that
in
--
if
--
if
an
employer
outlaws
this
conduct
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act
or
to
put
it
in
precisely
the
facts
of
this
case,
nutone
inc,
in
this
case,
the
could
have
prohibited
the
distribution
of
literature
by
employees
within
the
plant.
mr.
david
e.
feller
without
violating
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
i
put
the
proviso
on
it
which,
of
course,
is
my
case.
that
it
can
do
so
in
the
interest
only
of
littering
--
of
preventing
littering
and
that
it
destroys
the
justification
for
its
right
to
do
so
when
it
itself
litters
the
premises
and
does
precisely
the
thing
through
its
foreman
that
it
has
forbidden
the
employees
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
in
an
analysis
of
the
problem,
your
honor,
we
--
in
our
brief
perhaps
have
to
greater
length,
discuss
the
whole
history
of
this
no-distribution
rules
because
there
is
a
problem
which
isn't
relevant
here
as
to
whether
the
board
can
proceed
here
as
a
general
rule
and
say
you
can
prohibit
the
distribution
of
literature
or
whether
to
do
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
that
is
the
point
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
if
that
has
always
been
stated
to
be
the
reason
for
the
board's
rule
in
every
case
in
which
the
board
has
permitted
an
employer
to
make
this
kind
of
prohibition,
it'll
always
said,
“in
the
interest
of
keeping
the
plant
free
of
litter.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
rule?
mr.
david
e.
feller
can
be
done?
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
board
has
said
that
if
the
dissemination
by
word
of
mouth
is
not
on
working
time
where
the
men's
supposed
to
be
working,
the
employer
cannot
forbid
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
as
a
general
proposition.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
don't
know
if
anyone
has
ever
tried
that,
your
honor.
we
have
to
accept
certain
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
general
rules
based
on
general
propositions
without
proving
in
an
individual
case.
well,
the
board
at
one
time
has
lead
to
make
you
prove
in
the
individual
case
the
need
to
prevent
littering,
you
finally
said,
“well,
we'll
accept
the
general
proposition
that
these
rules
are
valid
to
prevent
littering,”
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
--
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule
as
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
even
go
further.
all
the
rules
with
respect
to
limitation
on
employees
as
to
what
--
how
they
can
communicate
with
each
other
on
plant
premises,
all
of
the
rules
and
there
are
quite
a
number
of
different
ones
depending
from
the
nature
of
the
premises
are
always
premised
on
the
proposition
that
the
rule
if
valid
is
based
upon
some
necessity
relating
to
production
or
orderly
operation
of
the
plant.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
tried
to
limit
myself
in
my
original
statement,
your
honor
to
the
plant
premises
where
the
people
are
working.
when
he
builds
a
separate
hall,
then
you
get
a
problem
as
you
had
in
stowe
spinning.
if
it's
attached
to
the
property,
it
may
gets
a
little
--
you
get
a
kind
of
mixed
question.
i'm
talking
about
--
when
i
say
plant
premises
i'm
talking
about
the
places
where
the
people
work.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
offices
which
may
adjoin.
i'm
not
asking
for
a
right
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
for
the
union
to
go
into
the
offices
or
any
other
hall
that
the
employer
may
--
i'm
talking
about
when
the
men
are
working
in
the
plant.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
this
is
precisely
what
i
think
is
at
the
heart
of
what
--
what
the
board's
argument
is
here,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
is
very
important.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
if
there
is
no
element
of
littering.
i
--
i
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
board
has
established
recently,
after
a
long
history
of
trying
one
thing
and
another,
that
as
a
general
rule,
it
will
assume
that
a
rule
against
littering
on
the
plant
premises.
a
rule
against
distribution
is
valid
because
of
the
interest
in
the
usual
case
of
the
employer
in
keeping
his
plant
free
from
littering.
now,
what
would
happen
in
the
case
in
which
you
could
show
either
one
that
there
was
no
such
danger
in
the
case?
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
--
in
the
woolworth
case
that
involved
not
the
distribution
of
literature
but
oral
solicitation.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
oral
solicitation,
the
board
again
as
in
the
littering
case
and
it
happens,
there
are
differences
and
even
as
--
as
to
the
distribution
of
literature.
i
suppose
if
this
was
a
mining
camp,
the
board
might
say,
“if
you
can
show
that
there's
no
other
way
of
doing
it,
we'll
make
an
exception
to
the
normal
rule.”
now,
the
woolworth
case
involves
an
exception
to
the
normal
rule
on
oral
solicitation.
there
you
have
a
retail
store.
this
case
comes
up
with
woolworth,
bonwit
teller,
you
name
of
the
store.
normally,
the
rule
is,
as
expressed
in
--
by
the
board
in
peyton
packing
and
approved
by
this
court,
is
that
working
time
is
for
work.
but
non-working
time,
when
the
employees
are
having
rest
periods,
lunch
period
in
the
plant
premises,
the
employer
can't
say,
”because
you're
on
my
property,
i
won't
let
you
talk
about
the
union.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
i
think
that
the
board
says
that
this
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
such
a
rule
constitute
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
an
interference
with
--
with
the
employee
organization.
it
existed
long
before
8
(c)
in
the
act
or
irrespective
of
constitutional
ground
it
says,
“you
cannot
say.”
i
suppose
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
a
person
to
get
on
another
person's
property
and
say
what
he
wants
there.
the
other
person
will
say,
“you
can
say
it
but
get
off
my
property
when
you
do
it.”
it's
not
a
constitutional
question
but
it's
an
interference
with
the
employee's
right
to
self-organization,
to
say
when
you're
in
a
normal
place
for
you
to
be,
that
you
can't
talk
about
the
union.
now,
coming
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
case,
the
board
recognized
that
if
you
got
5
and
10
or
a
department
store
and
there
are
sales
people
on
the
floor
who
may
not
be
working
at
the
time,
it
might
disrupt
the
operation
quite
considerably
to
have
them
going
around
arguing
about
the
union
even
though
they
weren't
supposed
to
be
working
at
the
time.
so,
they
evolved
a
special
rule
that
in
retail
stores,
the
employer
could
prevent
oral
solicitation
even
on
non-working
time
on
the
selling
floor.
this
was
based
upon
the
considerations
peculiar
to
that
industry.
there
are
whole
series
of
rules,
in
different
kinds
of
industries,
and
different
kinds
of
places.
but
in
every
case,
including
the
department
store
case,
the
board
has
always
said
that
they
can
do
this
if
they
do
it
in
an
even-handed
fashion
provided
it's
not
discriminatorily
enforce.
there
is
no
case
until
this
case
came
along,
if
your
honors
please
in
which
an
employer
enforced
a
rule,
which
he
was
presumably
entitled
to
do
in
the
interest
of
production
of
efficiency
and
at
the
same
--
same
time
himself
did
precisely
what
the
rule
in
effect.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
assume
then
that
the
employees
would
have
had
the
right
to
themselves
say,
he's
a
liar,
when
they
weren't
working,
as
he
said
in
his
distributions
here
and
his
distributions
here
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
on
the
union
people
and
presumably
we
can
each
talk
to
each
other
on
the
plant
premises.
now
,we
don't
know
if
it
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
no.
i
would
say
that
the
employees
in
that
case
could
do
precisely
what
he
did
and
that
is
talk
to
each
other
about
the
very
things
that
he
talked
to
each
other.
that's
the
oral
solicitation
case
and
the
rule
and
the
board's
rule
is
that
the
employer
cannot
forbid
them
from
doing
that.
and
presumably,
the
employer
has
the
right
himself
to
do
it
on
the
plant
premises,
the
say
what
he
wants
about
the
union
and
the
union
can
say
or
the
employees
can
say
what
they
think
about
the
employer.
there's
a
balance
there.
in
the
oral
solicitation
there's
a
balance
on
the
written
solicitation.
i
want
before
my
time
expires,
to
get
what
i
think
is
at
the
heart
of
this
--
which
isn't
really
expressed
very
well
by
the
board,
i
will
say.
it's
expressed
somewhat
better
in
the
board's
brief
as
to
what
the
heart
of
the
real
rule
here
is
and
the
real
position
which
the
board
is
trying
to
assert,
which
i
think,
goes
far
beyond
the
requirements
of
this
case.
i
think
it's
of
tremendous
significance
to
develop
under
the
law
of
labor
relations
and
to
the
whole
administration
of
the
act.
and
that
notion
is
this,
and
the
whole
premise
of
this,
what
i
regard
is
outrageous
language
about
employer
prerogative
is
this,
is
that
this
is
the
employer's
plant.
he
owns
it,
his
property
right
in
the
plant.
not
the
interest
of
efficient
production.
the
fact
that
it's
his
property
gives
him
the
right
to
say,
how
that
property
shall
be
used
with
respect
to
the
union
question.
and
that
absent,
showing
that
there
are
other
means
of
communication,
any
rules
that
he
makes
concerning
how
employees
conduct
themselves
in
arguing,
discussing,
distributing
on
the
union
question,
on
his
premises.
he
can
make
because
after
all,
it
is
his
property.
this
is
precisely
the
reasoning,
if
i
may
say
so,
that
this
court
used
in
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case
with
respect
to
a
parking
lot
and
with
respect
to
nonemployee
union
organizers
and
the
language
which
is
--
mr.
manoli
read
concerning
the
accommodation
of
property
rights
and
rights
of
organization
comes
from
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case.
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case,
the
--
this
court
said,
"unless
you
show
that
there's
no
other
way
to
distribute
literature,
the
employer
can
keep
a
union
organizer
off
his
parking
lot
and
prevent
that
union
organizer
from
distributing
literature."
and
the
question
would
be
adequacies
of
other
methods
of
communication.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
the
question
which
i've
never
addressed
to
myself
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
mean,
i've
not
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
never
thought
about
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
subject
to
the
reservation
of
an
answer
to
an
unanticipated
question
may
be
one
that
one
may
regret
later,
i
would
say
that
congress
if
it
repealed
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
leave
the
employer,
i
thankfully
to
say
to
his
employees,
"you
wear
red
hats
when
you're
in
this
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
or
say
what
you
want
or
do
what
you
want
and
he
could
do
precisely,
what
he
did
here.
mr.
david
e.
feller
so
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
if
--
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
would
be
a
--
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
question
and
then
we
would
have
to
--
you
mean
where
they
could
constitutionally
do
this?
mr.
david
e.
feller
is
that
your
honor's
question?
mr.
david
e.
feller
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
think,
as
an
offhand
answer
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
that
the
board
--
rather
the
board
--
the
board
could
constitutionally
do
this.
i've
never
really
considered
that
question.
i
have
never
assumed
and
your
honor
raised
the
question
which
i've
been
expecting
to
be
raised
in
this
case
from
the
time
it
began.
and
i
will
say
that
your
assumption
that
your
honor
made
in
question
to
mr.
manoli
as
to
the
representation
of
the
steel
workers
is
not
quite
an
adequate
one
in
the
sense
that
this
case
i
think
was
actually
the
only
people
for
the
union
there,
when
it
was
tried
where
the
staff
man
will
usually
attend
these
things.
we
went
before
the
board
actually
counsel
for
the
steel
workers
as
a
union
only
get
into
these
cases
as
if
they
get
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
right,
but
they're
somewhat
limited,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
there's
no
question
that
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
difference
here
is
a
hypothetical
one
only
in
that,
that
the
employer
prevented
--
he
said
that
--
that
the
employees
who
are
against
the
union
also
couldn't
distribute,
i
must
say
that.
but
he
could
get
in
there
and
get
to
the
fight
against
the
union
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
is
your
question,
would
that
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
have
the
slightest
doubt
about
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
don't
think
the
board
has
any
doubt
about
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
effect
of
this
rule,
we
contend,
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
rule
as
what
your
honor
set
forth.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
the
act
forbids
the
employer
to
interfere
with
efforts
of
his
employees
to
organize
themselves
and
any
restriction
he
makes
on
their
communications
in
the
place
where
they
have
a
right
to
be,
must
be
justified
by
some
necessity
of
production,
else
it
is
an
--
plain
violation
and
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
the
case,
your
honor
put
the
distinction
which
the
employer
drew
between
which
sides
of
the
question
you're
on
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
restriction
was
not
related
to
the
efficiency
of
the
production
but
was
related
to
whether
the
employer
wanted
the
union
or
not
and
that
he
is
not
permitted
to
do
under
the
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
(voice
overlap)
may
i
distinguish
between
what
i
think
with
that
question
and
mr.
justice
--
that
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional.
i
wouldn't
have
any
question
about
that.
the
question
which
i
answered
was
if
congress
said
that
employers
could
make
rules
like
the
one
your
honor
mentioned
regarding
their
plant
property
or
as
i
try
to
phrase
it,
if
it
just
repealed
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
i
think
might
leave
them
free
to
make
such
rules
offhand,
i
didn't
think
there
was
to
be
anything
unconstitutional
about
that.
obviously,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
the
board
or
congress
established
the
rule.
the
question
is,
if
congress
said
that
he
employers
can
do
this
or
not
if
they
want
to
with
respect
to
their
plant
property
well,
that
would
be
constitutional
and
that
i
answer
differently.
your
honor
there
--
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
two
questions
which
were
answered
to
me
which
i
never
got
--
quite
got
to
finish.
now,
i
wonder
whether
i
may
have
the
additional
time
to
just
answer
those
additional
questions.
mr.
david
e.
feller
as
briefly
as
i
can.
now,
the
one
question
i
think
that
was
asked
--
now
--
now,
i've
--
i've
--
now
let's,
i
get
off.
i
can't
remember
what
--
which
the
question
was.
i
was
in
the
middle
of
answering.
on
this
question
of
property
rights,
i
was
in
the
middle
of
--
of
calling
your
honors'
attention
to
the
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
is
on
page
104
of
the
record.
in
which
it
says
that
our
attention
has
not
been
called
to
any
case
under
the
wagner
act
or
its
successor
in
which
it
is
held,
which
it
has
been
held
that
an
employer
can
prohibit
either
solicitation
or
distribution
of
literature
by
employees
simply
because
the
premises
are
company
property.
and
i
would
suggest
that
not
only
are
there
no
such
cases
but
all
the
cases
including
all
of
the
cases
in
this
court
are
--
are
to
the
contrary.
thank
you.
