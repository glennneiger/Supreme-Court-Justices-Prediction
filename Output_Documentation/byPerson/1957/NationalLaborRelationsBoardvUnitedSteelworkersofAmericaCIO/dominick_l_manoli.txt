mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
like
the
preceding
case,
this
case
deals
generally
for
the
right
of
employees
to
communicate
with
fellow
employees
concerning
unionization
on
their
employer's
property
premises.
it
differs
from
the
other
case
as
i
indicated
in
the
other
case,
that
here
we
have
to
do
with
oral
solicitation
as
distinguished
from
distribution
of
literature.
there's
a
further
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
one
is
that
here,
section
8
(c)
plays
no
part
in
the
resolution
of
this
case.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
and
as
mr.
feller
has
also
confirmed
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
we
say
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
literature
that
the
basic
consideration
for
prohibiting
employees
from
distributing
such
literature
in
the
plant
is
not
only
the
littering,
but
also
the
further
fact
that
there
are
other
avenues
available
to
the
employees
for
the
distribution
of
such
literature
outside
the
plant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
that
is
true.
that
is
true.
it
said
that
even
one
of
our
own
case,
republic
aviation,
but
we
think
nevertheless,
that
these
are
problems
of
accommodation.
and
that
is
not
--
i
was
certain
it's
not
an
irrelevant
factor
and
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
the
board,
we
think,
to
give
it
considerable
weight.
and
you
can't
fit
all
of
these
cases
into
a
nice
logical
pattern
because
each
one
of
them
involves
some
kind
of
an
accommodation
of
conflicting
interest
and
the
--
the
result
that
you
reach
in
one
case
may
not
square
logically
with
the
result
in
some
other
case,
because
i
think
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
problem.
these
are
accommodation
problems.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
thought
the
chief
was
asking
me
as
to
what
the
basis
of
the
distinction
between
the
two
is,
solicitation
and
distribution.
now,
i've
indicated
with
respect
to
distribution
of
literature,
the
rule
rest
not
only
upon
the
question
of
littering
but
also
on
the
availability
of
other
channels
for
the
distribution
of
such
literature
outside
the
plant.
now,
as
i
will
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
i
suppose
there's
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it's
his
own
property
after
all,
your
honor.
the
plant
is
his
own
property.
in
fact,
that
he
may
rent
a
hole
somewhere
else
should
not
curtail
his
proprietary
control
over
the
property
after
all.
i
don't
think
we
could
ignore
the
fact
that
it's
his
property.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
talking
about
the
rule
which
prohibits
the
employers
from
distributing
literature
either
pro
or
contra
union,
that
he
may
prohibit
them
from
doing
it
within
the
plant,
even
though
he,
himself,
uses
his
own
plant
premises
for
the
distribution
of
his
own
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
on
the
same
subject.
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that's
the
upshot
of
the
board
decision
in
nutone,
coupled
with
the
board's
decision
in
livingston
shirt
on
which
this
court
--
on
which
the
board
in
this
case
relied.
in
livingston
shirt,
if
i
may
explain,
there,
the
employer
had
addressed
his
--
the
employees
on
company
time
and
a
union
asked
for
an
equivalent
opportunity
to
address
the
employees
on
company
time.
the
board
not
only
stressed
the
protected
character
of
the
employer's
speech
that
would
--
wasn't
of
course,
it
carried
out
time.
but
it
also
stressed
the
fact,
the
union
had
available
other
places
for
reaching
the
employees
for
this
purpose
than
the
employer's
property.
and
as
i
say
in
this
nutone
--
in
the
nutone
case,
the
first
case
we've
got
you
arguing,
the
board
does
rely
upon
that,
the
fact
that
it
is
the
employer's
property
and
it
also
relies
upon
the
availability
of
other
ways
of
distributing
literature.
it
--
well,
let
me
say
this.
it
relies
upon
the
livingston
shirt,
which
i
think
permits
us
to
make
the
full
blown
argument
that
the
availability
of
other
avenues
for
the
distribution
of
literature
away
from
the
company's
plant
is
an
additional
factor
which
the
board
may
take
into
consideration
and
say
concluding,
that
the
employer's
use
of
his
own
property
doesn't
require
him
to
give
a
similar
opportunity
to
his
own
employs
to
distribute
literature
within
the
plant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
does
not
give
weight
to
that
consideration
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
literature.
and
it
doesn't
give
weight
to
that
factor
with
respect
to
oral
solicitation
during
non-working
time
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
because
often,
the
employees
are
permitted
to
discuss
religion,
politics
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
now,
the
rule
is,
the
board
is
held
and
the
courts
have
approved
this.
the
rule
is
that
the
employees
--
that
the
employer
may
forbid
the
employees
from
engaging
in
oral
solicitation
during
working
time.
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
such
a
rule
becomes
invalid.
and
therefore,
an
improper
basis
for
the
discharge
of
employees
who
engaged
in
such
solicitation
during
working
time
if
the
employer
himself
engages
in
coercive,
or
anti-union
solicitation
during
working
time.
let
me
give
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
this,
for
this
issue
here.
here,
in
sometime
in
1954,
the
textile
workers
union
sought
to
organize
the
company's
employees.
shortly
thereafter,
the
company
summoned
a
number
of
employees
who
were
suspected
of
having
solicited
other
fellow
employees
to
join
the
union
during
working
time
and
they
were
warned.
they
were
warned
that
it
was
against
the
company's
rules
for
them
to
engage
in
union
solicitation
during
company
time,
during
working
time.
and
that
in
the
infraction
of
the
rule
would
result
in
their
dismissal.
contemporaneously
with
this
warning,
the
company
also
added
a
further
warning,
that
if
the
union
succeeded
in
organizing
the
plant,
the
plant
would
close
down.
shortly
thereafter,
a
number
of
the
company's
supervisory
personnel
engaged
in
what
i
think
maybe
fairly
characterized
as
a
widespread
campaign
against
the
union
during
working
time.
during
working
time,
these
supervisory
people
approached
various
employees
at
their
work.
they
interrogated
them
concerning
their
union
membership.
they
solicit
them
to
withdraw
from
the
union.
they
warned
them
that
unionization
of
the
plant
would
result
in
closing
of
the
plant,
and
further
warned
them
that
they
would
lose
their
jobs
and
other
benefits.
while
this
was
going
on,
the
company
discharged
two
employees,
allegedly
for
violating
the
rule
against
solicitation
during
working
time.
and
the
record
shows
in
fact
that
these
employees
had
solicited
fellow
workers
to
join
the
union
during
working
time.
and
the
one
--
one
man
was
discharged
because
he
had
solicited
the
elevator
operator
as
they
were
going
up
and
down
the
elevator,
the
operator
of
the
elevator,
and
the
other
one
--
the
other
one
have
solicited
a
fellow
employee
to
join
the
union,
who
the
fellow
employee
was
at
work,
but
the
man
who
was
doing
the
soliciting,
a
man
who
was
discharged
was
off
work
at
the
time.
so
i
say
the
company
discharged
these
two
men
allegedly
for
violating
its
rule
against
solicitation
during
working
time.
the
board
found
that
the
employer
had
violated
the
statute
by
his
coercive
statements
and
conduct
namely,
the
interrogation
of
employees
concerning
memberships,
soliciting
them
to
withdraw,
the
threats
of
economic
reprisals
if
the
union
succeeded
in
organizing
--
in
organizing
the
plant.
with
respect
to
the
two
employees
who
were
discharged,
the
board
found
that
their
discharge
was
discriminatory
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
that
they
were
discharged,
in
board's
view,
they
were
discharged
not
for
the
violation
of
a
valid
no-solicitation
rule,
but
rather,
that
they
were
discharged
for
conduct,
otherwise,
protected
by
the
statute.
and
the
basis
of
that
was
that
the
--
in
the
board's
view,
the
employer
by
his
own
action,
by
his
own
coercive
anti-human
solicitation
during
working
time
had
in
effect
invalidated
the
rule.
and
that
therefore,
the
employer
could
not
invoke
the
rule
against
the
employers
who
engaged
in
similar
conduct
without
violating
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
differs
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
that
largely
depends
i
suppose
upon
how
these
issues
have
sort
of
come
up
the
ladder
to
this
court.
i
think
it
is
an
independent
matter.
the
board
might
have
said
in
the
other
case,
that
in
view
of
the
employer's
other
unfair
labor
practices,
we
conclude
that
his
invocation
of
the
rule
--
again,
in
the
prohibition
against
the
employees
was
of
a
discriminatory
character.
conceivably
might
have
said
that,
of
course,
we
would
have
been
faced
with
problems
of
what
section
8
(c)
does
to
that
since
the
employer's
speeches
were
not
of
a
coercive
character.
but
that
is
not
the
way
the
issue
has
come
up
as
i
say.
the
issue
in
--
in
that
other
case
has
finally
boiled
down
to
this
very
narrow
one
of
whether
standing
alone
without
regard
to
the
surrounding
circumstances,
the
employer's
naked
prohibition
against
the
employees'
distributing
literature
within
the
plant
is
bad
when
he
himself
distributes
literature
within
the
plant
himself.
here,
the
case
has
not
come
up
that
way.
what
we
have
here
is
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
rule
must
be
determined
as
against
those
unfair
labor
practice
as
i
hope
to
show
in
just
a
moment.
now,
continuing
with
the
board's
order
in
this
case.
the
board
required
the
employer
to
refrain
from
engaging
the
unfair
labor
practice
which
it
found.
it
required
the
employer
to
reinstate
these
two
employees
and
file
it.
it
required
the
employer
to
cease
enforcing
the
rule
against
solicitation
and
the
discriminatory
action
that
the
board
found
had
been
enforced.
the
court
below
approved
the
board's
findings
that
the
employer
by
his
statements
to
these
various
employees
during
working
time
had
engaged
in
conduct
prohibited
by
the
statute.
the
court
below,
however,
rejected
the
board's
findings
that
the
discharge
of
the
two
employees
for
allegedly
for
violating
the
rule
against
solicitation
was
discriminatory.
in
the
court's
view,
there
was
no
basis
in
the
record
so
except
for
concluding
that
the
rule
had
against
solicitation
during
working
time
by
the
employees
had
been
invalidated
by
any
action
of
the
employer.
and
this
purpose
was
bottomed
upon
the
subsidiary
premise
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
which
indicated
the
employer
had
ever
permitted
any
solicitation
of
any
kind
in
violation
of
the
rule.
now,
initially
we
think
that
the
court
has
misconceived
--
has
misconceived
the
nature,
the
legal
significance
of
the
action
of
the
--
of
the
supervisory
employees
approaching
these
various
employees
during
working
time
and
asking
them
in
effect
to
abandon
the
union.
as
i
have
indicated,
there
was
a
widespread
effort
on
the
part
of
supervisory
personnel
to
persuade
the
employees
not
to
join
--
or
to
leave
the
union
and
not
to
join
it.
but
it's
more
than
persuasion,
it
was
of
a
coercive
character.
the
court
of
--
and
the
court
below
of
course
agreed
in
accepting
these
findings,
agreed
that
this
was
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
that
it
was
of
a
coercive
character.
and
of
course,
section
8
(c)
plays
no
part.
but
we
think,
and
this
is
in
--
this
is
important
to
our
case,
we
think
that
what
the
court
had
--
has
failed
to
perceive
that
the
action
of
the
supervisory
personnel
in
going
to
these
various
employees
during
the
working
time
constitutes
solicitation,
just
as
much
in
violation
of
the
company's
rules
as
to
the
action
of
the
employees
who
were
discharged
when
they
were
soliciting
for
the
union.
now,
with
that
premise
--
with
that
premise,
i
think
we
come
into
the
heart
of
this
case
namely,
whether
employer's
enforcement
of
a
rule
of
this
solicitation,
by
the
employees
during
working
time,
becomes
discriminatory.
when
he
enforces
that
--
it
would
become
discriminatory
when
he
himself
violates
the
rule
in
a
manner
that's
not
protected
by
section
8
(c).
the
board
as
i
say,
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative.
and
the
court
below
disagreed
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated.
and
i
do
say
that
i
think
that
the
court
below
if
i
may
use
the
expression
went
off
the
track
because
of
its
initial
misconception,
its
initial
misconception
of
what
the
supervisory
employees
were
doing.
if
they
were
violating
the
act,
that
is
the
rule
against
solicitation,
just
as
much
as
the
employees.
now,
as
i
indicated
in
the
other
case,
the
basis,
the
accommodation
which
has
been
worked
out
under
the
statue
with
respect
to
oral
solicitations
is
that
the
employer
may
permit
the
employees
from
engaging
in
oral
solicitations
during
working
time.
and
the
basis
of
that
rule
is,
that
the
employers'
interest
in
the
efficient
running
of
this
plant
and
plant
discipline,
compels
that
the
employee's
interest
in
the
effective
communication
of
their
ideas
concerning
unionization,
that
the
employer's
interest
should
be
paramount,
it
should
be
paramount
to
that
--
to
the
employees
interest
in
communicating
among
themselves
with
respect
to
union
matters.
now,
we
believe,
we
believe
that
once
the
employer
himself
has
engaged
in
coercive
anti-union
solicitation
to
--
during
the
working
time,
he
has
destroyed
the
basis
of
the
accommodation.
now,
i
know
the
question
is,
“how
do
we
distinguish
this
case
from
the
other
case?”
the
distinction
is
this.
that
the
--
that
the
accommodation
in
the
other
case
rests
on
a
much
broader
basis.
it
rests
upon
the
basis
as
we
see
it.
not
only
the
--
of
the
--
on
the
basis
of
the
employer's
interest
in
preventing
his
plant
from
being
littered
but
also
the
further
consideration
that
there
are
other
avenues
of
communication
available
to
the
employees
for
the
distribution
of
literature.
but
here,
the
accommodation
which
has
been
worked
---
which
is
been
worked
out
under
the
statute
with
respect
to
oral
solicitation
rest
upon
the
consideration
of
the
employer's
interest
in
the
efficient
running
of
his
plant
requires
the
employees
not
to
be
permitted
to
engage
in
such
solicitation
during
working
time.
but
we
said,
that
once
the
employer
engages
in
that
kind
of
conduct,
he
didn't
think
--
as
a
matter
of
law
we
think
manifest
that
he
is
no
--
when
he
enforces
the
rule
against
the
employees,
that
he
is
no
longer
prompted
by
considerations
of
efficiency,
but
rather,
that
the
dismissal
of
those
employees
rest
not
upon
the
violation
of
a
valid
plant
rule,
but
rather
upon
activity
which
is
otherwise
protected
by
the
statute.
and
in
that
respect,
we
think
that
this
case
in
that
posture,
this
case
is
not
unlike
the
republic
aviation
case.
in
the
republic
aviation
case,
the
employer
had
prohibited
the
employees
from
engaging
in
union
solicitation
during
non-working
time.
of
course,
there
is
that
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case,
during
non-working
time.
but
the
court
and
one
or
two
employees
i
believe
were
discharged
for
having
solicited
during
non-working
time.
the
court
said
that
rule
was
too
broad.
it
was
invalid.
and
therefore,
even
though
the
employer
may
not
have
been
prompted
by
any
anti-union
advice
nevertheless,
when
he
discharged
those
employees
on
the
basis
of
an
invalid
rule
by
respect
to
solicitation,
the
discharge,
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
law
rested
upon
--
was
based
upon
the
employee's
exercise
of
rights
protected
by
the
statute.
so
here,
we
say
that
the
employer's
conduct
with
anti-union
solicitation
during
the
working
time,
if
that
invalidated
the
rule,
and
the
rule
being
invalid
to
discharge
if
these
employees
rest
not
upon
the
violation
of
a
valid
plant
rule,
but
rather
upon
activity
otherwise
protected
by
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
just
have
one
or
two
things
to
add
your
--
if
the
court
please.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
--
if
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
the
nutone
case
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
affirms
that
decision?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
we
have
suggested
in
--
in
our
own
brief
in
--
in
this
case
that
if
you
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
of
nutone,
you
must
reverse
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
you
must
--
you
must
reverse
i
think
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
fundamentally
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
at
--
at
this
sort
of
thing
is
a
two-way
street
or
if
i
may
put
it
in
this
fashion
that
what
is
sauce
for
the
employer
is
also
a
sauce
for
the
goose.
and
that
if
the
employer
distributes
literature,
he
must
also
permit
the
employees
to
distribute
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
in
the
other
case,
the
court
said
in
nutone,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
you
can't
enforce
the
rule
against
distribution
of
literature
in
the
plant
which
you
normally
can't
because
you,
yourself,
have
destroyed
the
reason
for
that
rule.
now,
that
is
--
our
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
--
in
nutone
that
employer
by
his
own
action.
of
course,
we
disagree
with
it
--
with
its
decision
that
the
employer
by
his
own
action
has
destroyed
the
reason
for
the
rule.
and
therefore,
he
cannot
invoke
the
rule
against
the
employees.
here,
our
position
was
that
the
employer
has
destroyed
the
basis
of
his
rule
by
forbidding
employees
from
engaging
in
oral
solicitation
during
working
time,
but
his
own
entire
union
coercive
solicitation
during
working
time.
now,
if
it's
a
two-way
street
in
the
other
case
as
the
court
of
appeals
thought
in
nutone,
it's
also
has
to
be
a
two-way
street
in
this
case.
now,
however
though,
of
course
our
position
is
that
we
can
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
nutone
and
also
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that's
why
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
got
up
to
make
a
comment
on
that
--
on
that
problem.
fundamentally,
we
--
we
read
the
board's
decision
to
hold
that
where
an
employer
engages
in
this
kind
of
coercive
anti-union
solicitation
during
working
time,
that
he
thereby
as
a
matter
of
law
invalidates
the
rule
with
respect
to
the
employees.
and
that
if
he
discharges
employees
for
engaging
in
oral
solicitation
during
working
time,
when
he,
himself
is
engaged
in
the
counterpart
of
that
conduct,
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
he
has
discriminated
against
them.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
i
mean
--
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
the
phases
for
the
rule
to
begin
with
is
that
the
employer
is
in
(inaudible)
--
the
efficient
running
of
his
plant
is
such
that
he
can
forbid
the
employees
from
engaging
in
--
in
solicitation
during
working
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
when
he
himself
--
when
he
himself
engages
in
that
very
conduct,
he
has
destroyed
the
basis
of
that
accommodation.
and
this
case
is
not
--
is
not
a
factual
issue,
your
honor.
this
case
i
think
is
more
like
the
warren
case
which
came
up
from
the
fifth
circuit.
in
that
case,
the
court
will
recall
the
problem
was
whether
or
not
an
employer
had
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
enforced
the
board's
order
--
required,
whether
the
employer
was
in
contempt
with
the
court's
decree
which
enforced
the
board's
bargaining
order.
in
that
case,
the
court
said,
“well,
if
we
looked
at
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“we've
looked
at
the
record
and
we
find
that
there
is
no
basis,
no
basis
for
holding
that
the
union
--
that
the
company
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
--
has
failed
to
bargain.”
now,
this
court
in
disposing
of
that
problem
said
these
words,
now
i
think
they
apply
here,
that
if
we
had
so
understood
the
record,
certiorari
would
not
have
been
granted,
but
we
do,
sir,
not
so
understand,
it
would
belittle
the
facts
over
the
contrary
in
each
instance.
now,
in
this
case
here,
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
failed
to
give
a
--
has
failed
to
appreciate
the
legal
significance
of
a
non-disputed
fact
namely
that
the
employer
engaged
in
anti-union
--
in
anti-union
solicitation,
a
form
of
solicitation
just
as
much
in
violation
of
the
rule
as
what
the
employees
were
doing.
so,
in
short,
we
don't
think
that
this
case
presents
a
factual
issue,
but
on
the
contrary,
with
very
important
legal
questions.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
american
tube
bending,
i
--
i
gather
is
the
first
case,
that
your
honor
is
referring
to.
as
i
indicated
earlier
in
connection
with
my
original
argument,
in
american
tube
bending,
the
--
the
board
had
held
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
american
tube
bending,
the
board
had
held
that
where
the
employer
aired
his
views,
even
though
they
were
of
a
non-coercive
character
that
he
aired
those
views
on
his
premises,
that
the
mere
use
of
it
--
the
mere
utilization
of
these
premises
gave
a
coercive
thrust
to
his
speech.
and
this
is
important
we
think
in
connection
with
nutone
that
8
(c)
wasn't
disapproved
or
rather
congress
expressedly
disapproved
of
the
holding
in
american
tube
where
the
board
in
effect
had
penalized
the
employer
for
the
use
of
his
property,
rather
in
for
what
he
said.
and
we
use
that
as
an
additional
factor
for
supporting
the
board's
position
in
the
nutone.
in
addition
to
the
availability
of
other
means
of
distributing
literature.
the
further
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(c)
indicates
that
an
employer
was
not
to
be
penalized
because
he
is
using
his
property
for
the
dissemination
or
distribution
of
(inaudible)
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
you
will
find
it
in
our
brief
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
in
the
nutone
case.
we
have
quoted

they
reported

in
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
before
turning
to
the
argument
in
this
case
i
wish
to
a
make
preliminary
statement.
the
court
will
note
that
the
solicitor
general
has
not
subscribed
his
name
into
the
board's
brief
in
this
case.
he
has,
however,
to
the
fact,
given
his
report
to
the
companion's
brief
in
here.
i
want
to
make
a
preliminary
statement.
i
wish
to
say
that
in
this
case
the
solicitor
general
has
not
subscribed
his
name
for
the
board's
brief.
he
has
however,
subscribed
his
name
to
the
companion's
brief
that
followed.
and
in
view
of
this,
the
solicitor
general
has
the
question
he
has
stated
to
the
court
that
in
this
case
i
speak
only
for
the
board.
companion
of
the
case
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
raises
a
very
delicate
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
i
would
rather
refrain
from
attempting
to
answer.
the
--
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
broadly
speaking,
it
deals
with
the
respective
rights
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
the
employer,
his
employees
to
distribute
literature
concerning
unionization
within
the
plant
where
the
employees
work.
as
i
shall
state
and
create
a
detail
in
a
moment,
it
is
fairly
well
settled
under
the
statute
that
an
employer
may
normally,
lawfully
forbid
his
employees
from
distributing
union
literature
within
the
plant,
without
regard
to
working
or
non-working
time.
and
our
problem
here
is
whether
the
employer
forfeits
his
right
if
he
as
long
as
if,
and
as
long
as
he
himself
distributes
his
own
literature
concerning
unionization
while
at
the
same
time
forbidding
his
employees
from
distributing
literature
within
the
plant.
stated
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
question
is
whether
the
employer's
prohibition
of
the
distribution
of
union
literature
by
his
employees
in
these
circumstances
constitutes,
interference,
unlawful
interference
under
the
statute
with
the
employees',
section
7
right,
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
for
their
mutual
aid
and
protection.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
issue
it
can
be
stated
quite
briefly.
in
1953,
the
respondent,
steelworkers
union
began
an
--
a
drive
to
organize
the
employees
of
the
nutone
company,
the
employer
involved
in
this
case.
nutone
company
has
applied
within
the
city
of
cincinnati,
ohio.
the
organizing
drive
culminated
in
election
before
the
board
to
determine
whether
the
employees
wish
to
be
represented
by
the
steelworkers
or
not
and
the
union
then
lost
that
election.
when
the
organizing
drive
that
the
steelworkers
got
underway,
the
company
posted
notices
in
the
plant
notifying
the
employees
that
it
was
against
the
company's
rules
to
pose
or
distribute
literature
of
any
kind
under
company's
premises
and
farther
that
this
prohibition
would
apply,
not
only
to
those
who
favor
the
union
but
those
who
are
also
opposed
to
the
union.
the
--
prior
--
prior
to
the
pre-election
period,
the
company
itself
had
never
deemed
to
self-bound
by
this
rule.
it
had
posted
notices,
distributed
literature
for
its
own
purposes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
was
before
the
election
your
honor,
before
the
election,
before
the
union
was
on
the
scene.
that
literature,
giving
notices
to
the
employees
concerning
various
matters
that
--
that
would
have
been
of
interest
to
them.
actually
the
record
does
not
show
the
kind
of
literature
that
the
company
was
--
or
notices
that's
--
that
were
--
the
company
was
posting
prior
to
the
election
period.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
apparently
both,
apparently
both.
now,
after
as
i
say
the
union-organizing
drive
got
under
way,
the
union
began
to
distribute
its
own
literature
in
the
public
area,
in
front
of
the
plant.
and
the
company
in
turn
distributed
its
literature
within
the
plant.
now,
this
literature
reflected
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
the
company's
rather
strong
opposition
to
the
issue
but
there's
no
question
here
that
the
contents
of
the
literature
were
within
the
permissible
limits
of
free
speech
under
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
--
on
these
facts,
the
board
found
that
the
employer's
prohibition
against
the
employees
distributing
literature
within
the
plant,
even
though
the
employer
was
simultaneously
distributing
his
anti-union
literature,
anti-union
but
non-coercive
literature
within
the
plant
did
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
statute.
the
court
below
while
acknowledging
that
the
question
was
not
entirely
free
of
difficulties
disagreed
with
the
board
and
held
that
the
employer's
action
this
prohibition
against
the
distribution
literature
by
his
employees
while
he
himself
distributed
his
own
literature
constituted
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
he
did
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
your
honor.
the
board
also
found
that
the
company
had
discharged
two
--
three
i
guess
--
three
--
three
employees
before
engaging
in
union
activity
and
the
board
also
found
that
following
the
steel
workers'
defeat
at
the
election
that
the
company
had
assisted
a
labor
organization
of
its
employees
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
--
the
court
below
held
that
--
that
was
8
(a)
(1),
8
(a)
(1)
that
fall
under
the
(inaudible)
of
interference
with
the
employer's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no
as
to
that
your
honor
as
to
the
employer's
prohibition,
against
the
employee
distributing
literature
within
the
plant
while
he
himself
distributed
his
own
literature,
the
board
dismissed
the
complaint.
there
was
a
complaint
before
the
board
which
alleged
that
this
action
was
discriminatory
and
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute.
the
board
dismissed
that
part
of
the
complaint
and
the
court
below
as
i've
indicated
disagreed
with
the
board
and
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
did.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
did
not
--
or
did
not
have
this
prohibition,
did
not
have
this
prohibition.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
they
do
not,
your
honor
as
this
issue
comes
before
this
court.
conceivably
as
an
independent
matter,
the
board
or
the
court
below
could
have
looked
to
these
other
factors
but
as
the
issue
has
come
through
the
courts
of
appeals
and
this
is
now
here,
i
think
we
have
the
naked
question.
we
have
the
naked
question
whether
the
employer's
prohibition
had
--
directed
against
his
employees
distributing
literature
within
the
plant
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
when
he
himself
distributes
his
own
literature
in
the
plant
at
the
same
time.
now,
the
basic
problem
which
we
have
here
i
think
is
one
of
accommodating
two
interests.
each
of
one
viewed
in
itself
tends
to
be
absolute.
namely,
the
employer's
proprietary
interest
and
control
over
his
property
as
against
the
employees'
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activities.
the
heart
of
the
respondent's
case
here
is,
that
the
statute
confers
upon
the
employees,
an
absolute
right
to
engage
in
either
oral
solicitation
for
union
purposes
or
to
distribute
literature
for
such
purposes
and
that
the
only
restrictions
which
may
be
placed
upon
the
exercise
of
this
right
on
the
employer's
premises
must
find
their
justification
in
considerations
and
must
find
their
--
their
justification
only
again,
considerations
of
the
efficiency
and
production.
and
the
argument
further
runs
that
such
a
showing
has
not
and
could
not
be
made
in
this
case
since
the
employer
himself
had
distributed
literature
in
the
plant.
the
court
please,
we
believe
that
the
argument
starts
from
to
broader
a
premise.
secondly,
that
it
overlooks
what
we
regard
as
significant
distinctions,
differences
between
all
union
solicitation
and
the
distribution
of
literature.
and
finally,
that
the
argument
fails
to
accord
the
proper
way
to
section
8
(c)
of
the
statute
which
provides
that
the
--
that
the
decimation
of
the
non-coercive
views
shall
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
constitute
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
statute.
we
think
that
the
basic
guide
post
which
will
lead
us
to
arriving
at
a
correct
solution
of
this
problem
was
expressed
by
this
court
in
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case.babcock
&
wilcox
case
which
came
up
before
this
court
some
two
years
ago.
in
that
case
the
court
will
recall,
the
problem
was
whether
nonemployee
union
organizers
were
entitled
to
go
on
the
employer's
parking
lot
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
the
employees
in
distributing
literature
to
them
on
the
parking
lot.
and
in
the
course
of
that
opinion
that
this
court
said
that
--
and
we
think
this
is
the
basic
test
that
will
solve
this
problem,
the
problems
of
this
character.
the
court
said
there,
“this
is
not
a
problem
of
always
open
or
always
closed
door
for
union
organization
on
company
property.”
organization
rights
are
granted
to
workers
by
the
same
authority,
the
national
government
that
preserves
copyrights.
accommodation
between
the
two
must
be
obtained
where
there's
little
destruction
of
one
as
is
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
the
other
and
we
think
that
the
accommodation
which
the
board
has
made
in
this
case
achieves
this
accommodation
between
the
two
interests
where
there's
little
infringement
or
abridgment
of
one
as
--
as
of
the
other.
let
me
explain
it.
traditionally,
labor
organizations
had
used
two
types
of
techniques
for
the
purpose
of
organizing.
one
of
them
is
oral
solicitation
and
the
other
one
is
the
distribution
of
literature
because
these
two
techniques
do
differ
in
character
they
have
received
different
treatment
under
the
statute.
and
i
believe
we
must
look
to
the
consideration
which
underlie
the
different
treatment
accorded
the
two
in
order
to
come
to
what
i
--
what
we
think
is
the
correct
solution
of
this
case.
and
i
might
say,
incidentally,
while--
while
this
case
involves
the
distribution
of
union
literature,
the
succeeding
case
involves
all
the
union
solicitation.
now,
with
respect
to
oral
union
solicitation,
the
rule
is
fairly
well-established
under
the
statute
that
an
employer
may
prohibit
the
employees
from
engaging
in
such
solicitation
during
working
time
but
that
he
may
not
prohibit
his
employees
from
engaging
such
--
such
oral
solicitation
during
nonworking
time
at
the
plant.
now,
that
rule
accomplishes
a
twofold
purpose.
it
--
for
on
one
hand,
it
protects
the
employer's
interest
in
the
efficient
running
of
his
plant.
on
the
other
hand,
it
makes
available
to
the
employees
for
purposes
of
union,
oral
union
solicitation
to
the
plant.the
plant
has
been
regarded
as
uniquely
appropriate
for
this
purpose.
and
because
it
is
so
uniquely
appropriate
for
this
purpose
if
we
had
a
broad
prohibition
which
restricted
employees
all
together,
from
access
to
the
plant
even
during
a
nonworking
time
for
purposes
of
oral
solicitation,
such
a
rule
would
place
a
serious
impediment
in
the
employees'
effective
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
by
restricting
the
right
of
the
employees
to
engage
in
such
oral
solicitation,
only
with
--
during
their
nonworking
time,
it
protects
the
employer's
interest.
it
protects
the
employer's
interest
in
the
efficient
running
of
his
plant.
the
accommodation
which
has
been
worked
out
with
respect
to
oral
solicitation
thus
preserves
the
employer's
interest
in
the
efficient
running
his
plant
and
at
the
same
time
does
not
impede
the
employees'
organizing
activity.
now,
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
literature
which
is
our
case,
not
here,
a
different
rule
has
been
evolved
under
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
such
literature,
it
is
established
under
the
statute
that
an
employer
may
normally
and
lawfully
forbid
his
employees
from
distributing
such
literature
within
the
plant,
without
regard
to
whether
it's
within
--
during
working
time
or
nonworking
time.
the
accommodation
which
has
been
worked
out
has
been
explained
sometimes.
in
fact,
the
court
below
explained
it
on
this
basis
that
the
employer's
interest
in
keeping
his
plant
clean,
preventing
literally,
is
sufficiently
great
to
override
the
employees'
interest
or
their
--
their
right
to
distribute
--
whatever
right
they
might
have
otherwise,
to
distribute
literature
within
the
plant.
the
court
below
relying
upon
these
basics
for
the
rule
against
the
distribution
of
literature
in
effect
said,
that
once
the
employer
has
distributed
literature,
he
has
destroyed
the
basis
of
the
rules,
namely,
littering.
now,
we
submit
your
honors,
that
while
the
--
littering,
the
problem
of
littering
is
an
important
consideration
that
underlies
the
rule
against
the
distribution
of
literature
within
the
plant
that
the
rule
has
a
much
broader
basis
than
that.
the
--
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
literature
is
the
fact
that
iy
carries
a
permanent
message
and
it
is
intended
to
be
read
by
the
recipient
at
his
convenience
and
that
purpose
is
served.
if
there
exists
outside
the
plant,
adequate
avenues
for
distribution
to
the
various
employees.it
can
be
sent
to
the
employees
through
the
mails.
it
can
be
handed
to
the
employees
just
as
readily
when
they
enter
--
come
into
the
plant
or
leave
the
plant
as
when
they
are
within
the
plant.
indeed
in
this
case,
the
union
distributed
literature
in
front
of
the
plant
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
union
was
incurring
any
difficulties
in
--
in
distributing
or
reaching
the
employees
with
this
literature.
and
as
i've
already
indicated,
mr.
justice
burton's
question,
the
union
did
not
ask
for
permission
to
distribute
literature
within
the
plant,
which
suggests
that
the
union
was
not
experiencing
any
serious
difficulties.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
withstanding.
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
legal
significance.
i
only
mentioned
it
that
it
seems
to
suggest
that
the
union
was
not
experiencing
any
particular
difficulty
in
--
in
distributing
this
literature
and
in
line
with
my
argument
that
there
are
other
avenues
of
access
available
to
the
employees
as
well
as
to
the
union
for
the
distribution
of
such
literature
outside
of
the
plant
premises.
and
i
might
also
add
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
republic
aviation
case
where
the
employer
has
a
parking
lot
such
as
is
the
case
here,
the
union,
the
employees
rather
--
the
employees
rather
are
entitled
to
distribute
literature
on
that
parking
lot.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
your
honor.
the
--
the
prohibition
in
this
case
included
all
of
the
premises
of
the
--
of
the
company.
now
that
rule
apparently
was
not
challenged
by
the
board's
general
counsel's
complaint
in
this
case.
and
the
trial
examiner
concluded
the
rule
was
valid
but
i
believe
the
matter
never
came
up
before
the
board
itself.
but
i
believe
that
the
trial
examiner's
conclusion
misconceives
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
republic
aviation
because
in
this
--
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
republic
aviation,
the
court
held
that
the
employees
were
entitled
to
distribute
literature
on
the
parking
lot
of
their
employer
even
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
it
had
been
challenged,
yes,
i
think,
it
is.
if
it
had
been
challenged
that
rule
would
have
been
--
that
part
of
the
rule
would
be
bad.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
as
the
cases
developed
before
the
board,
your
honor,
and
as
the
issue
came
before
the
board,
the
principal
question
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
was
whether
the
employer's
prohibition
insofar
as
it
applied
to
distribution
within
the
plant,
within
the
plant
constituted,
a
violation
of
the
statute,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
himself
distributed
literature.
this
issue
i
don't
know
why
--
i
don't
know
why
this
issue
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
rule
as
to
parking
lots,
why
exception
was
--
why
that
wasn't
brought
to
the
board's
attention.
but
the
fact
is
that
it
was
not.
and
the
board
--
actually
the
board
noted
that
the
--
that
the
complaint
had
not
challenged
the
validity
of
the
rule
insofar
as
it
--
it
applied
to
the
parking
lot.
and
i
believe
it's
only
because
that
it
was
not
challenged
that
the
board
did
not
pass
upon
it.
and
i
believe
that
under
this
court's
ruling
in
republic
aviation
the
board's
ruling
would
have
had
to
be
that
that
rule
insofar
is
applied
to
the
parking
lot
was
bad.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
do
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
we
do
have
such
a
provision,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
statute
itself
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
section
10
--
section
10.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
first
question,
the
board
does
not
normally
take
into
account
matters
which
--
to
which
have
not
been
brought
to
his
attention
by
way
of
exceptions
to
the
trial
examiner's
report
or
which
are
not
included
within
the
framework
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
--
i'm
sure
that
i
can't
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
suppose
we
might
have
gone
through
such
a
presumption.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
there
is
not,
your
honor.
there
was
no
request
made.
there
is
no
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect.
i
assume
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
complaint
alleged,
the
original
complaint
alleged
that
this
was
a
discriminatory
rule
that
it
forbad
the
employees
from
distributing
their
own
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
interference
to
stand
in
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
presumably,
of
course,
i
don't
have
to
explain
that
your
honor
because
the
board
dismissed
the
complaint
[laughs]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
this
is
a
discriminatory
rule.
in
other
words
go
out
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
an
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
interference
--
the
first
provision
of
the
statute,
section
8
(a)
(1)
is
broad
enough
to
cover
discrimination.
it
just
doesn't
have
to
be
this,
8
(a)
(2)
involved
discrimination
between
like
say
two
competing
unions.
you
don't
have
that
situation
here
but
there
can
be
some
forms
of
discrimination
which
i've
covered
by
the
broad
phraseology
of
section
8
(a)
(1),
namely,
interference
to
sthis
kind
of
coercion.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
that
was
the
court
of
appeals'
view.
of
course,
i'll
--
to
be
quite
fair,
i
think,
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
as
well
as
to
my
friend
on
the
other
side
i
dare
to
say
that
perhaps
one
reason
why
the
union
didn't
ask
for
permission
to
distribute
literature
may
have
been
because
of
the
thought
over
the
--
i
know
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
this
but
it
conceived
it
may
have
thought
it
would
have
been
futile
and
therefore
it
did
not
make
the
attachment
for
the
request.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no.
if
the
--
if
--
even
if
no
request
had
been
made
and
not
clear
as
this
again
i
must
go
on
to
premise,
of
course,
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
at
the
very
existence
of
such
a
rule
in
those
circumstances
might
tend
to
service
with
terms
to
tend
to
service
a
restraint,
as
a
potential
restraint.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know.
i
think
that
question
should
be
addressed
to
my
friend
on
the
other
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
side
[laughs]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
within
the
plant?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
union
did
not,
no.
the
record
is,
that
they
distributed
literature
in
front
of
the
plant
in
the
public
areas.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
they
--
as
for
distributing
or
if
they
even
made
the
attempt
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
to
distribute
the
literature.
now,
coming
back
to
the
--
our
problem
here,
i've
indicated
the
kind
of
an
accommodation
that
has
been
worked
out
with
respect
to
distribution
of
literature
which
as
i
say,
normally,
the
employer
may
forbid
the
distribution
of
such
literature
within
the
plant
because
there
are
--
and
the
basis
of
that
is
not
merely
the
question
of
littering
but
because
there
are
other
avenues
available
for
the
distribution
of
such
literature
away
from
the
plant.
and
at
that
accommodation,
one
time
respects
the
employer's
control
over
his
property
and
at
the
same
time
it
works
no
substantial
diminution
of
the
employees'
interest
in
the
effective
dissemination
or
distribution
of
their
literature.
now,
what
is
the
additional
factor
that
we
have
here
that
in
the
court
from
the
view
--
view
of
the
court
below
made
the
difference.
the
additional
factor
here
is
that
the
employer
distributed
his
own
literature
on
the
plant
--
here
within
the
--
within
the
plant.
now,
i
submit,
your
honors
that
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
distributed
his
literature
--
am
i
30
minutes?
i
forgot
to
red
light
--
white
flag
means
[laughs]
the
--
the
fact
that
the
employer
distributes
his
own
literature
within
the
plant
does
not
--
we
submit,
disturb
the
balance
or
the
normal
avenues
for
the
distribution
of
such
literature,
remain
available
to
the
employees.
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
prohibit
them
from
distributing
literature
while
he
himself
distributes
his
own
literature
does
not
in
anyway
impede
the
employees'
use
of
this
normal
and
traditional
--
and
traditional
fashion
for
distributing
their
literature.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
wholly
unnecessary
in
order
to
protect
any
interests
which
the
employees
have
in
the
effective
exercise
of
their
right
to
distribute
literature,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
employer's
distribution
of
his
own
literature
affords
no
basis,
affords
no
basis
for
cutting
into
his
proprietary
interest
in
his
proprietary
control
of
this
property.
it
is
an
essential,
it
isn't
necessary
for
the
employees
to
have
this
additional
right
merely
because
he
had
distributed
his
own
literature,
to
protect
their
own
effective
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
statute.
and
there's
still
an
additional
factor,
while
we
think
that
the
board's
concludes
in
this
case
is
correct
and
that
is
section
8
(c)
of
the
statute.
section
8
(c)
as
i've
said
earlier,
i've
said
in
my
argument,
provides
that
the
expressing
of
any
views,
arguments,
or
opinions
whether
in
visual
or
a
printed
form
or
their
dissemination
shall
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
provided
they
have
no
--
shall
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
the
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
statute
if
the
views
are
of
a
non-coercive
character.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
our
view,
the
answer
would
have
been
the
same
before
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
would
not
been
a
--
it
would
not
have
been
a
violation
in
either
case.
i
think
in
the
court
of
opinion
--
obviously
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
think
that's
an
important
consideration
which
is
present
in
cases
of
this
kind,
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
i
would
distinguish
a
place
like
for
example
a
lumber
camp.
in
those
cases,
of
course,
this
court
has
frequentness
and
these
two
occasions
said
that
the
--
that
the
employees
must
be
accessible
not
only
to
fellow
employees
but
to
outside
organizers
as
well
in
order
to
make
effective
use
of
the
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
statute.
now,
continuing
with
section
8
(c),
normally,
of
course,
section
8
(c)
has
significant
--
significance
with
respect
to
that
contents
of
the
message.
but
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(c)
indicates
that
congress
meant
to
go
beyond
just
that.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
8
(c),
the
board
had
held
that
an
employer
committed
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
he
used
his
own
premises
merely
to
air
his
own
none-coercive
views
with
respect
to
the
unionization
of
his
employees.
and
the
board's
view
then
was,
that
by
the
mere
utilization
of
his
property
for
that
purpose,
that
that
gave
a
--
his
message
which
is
in
itself
contain
no
threats,
no
promises
about
it,
but
the
mere
utilization
of
his
property
gave
his
message
a
coercive
thrust
in
violation
of
the
statute.
and
again
later
on,
but
again
before
enactment
of
section
8
(c),
the
board
had
held
that
where
the
employer
required
his
employees
to
listen
to
him
during
company
time,
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
statute.
this
was
the
so-called
captive
audience
doctrine
which
in
effect
penalized
the
employer.
not
so
much
for
what
he
said
but
for
the
mere
use
of
his
property,
as
a
vehicle
for
expressing
his
views
concerning
union
matters
to
his
employees.
now,
we
think
that
congress
when
it
enacted
section
8
(c),
i
will
finish
in
the
final
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
think,
that
congress
--
even
we
don't
think
so.
in
fact,
it
is
--
it's
a
fact,
it's
indicated
in
the
senate
report
on
the
--
on
the
bill
that
it
expressly
disapproved
of
those
cases
which
penalized
the
employer,
as
i
say,
not
so
much
for
what
he
said
but
for
the
mere
use
of
his
property.
and
we
think
that
it's
the
board's
decision
here
is
in
accord
with
the
legislative
purpose
behind
section
8
(c).
thank
you.
