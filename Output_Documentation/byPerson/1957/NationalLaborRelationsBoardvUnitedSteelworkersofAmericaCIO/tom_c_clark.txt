did
you
say
to
justice
burton
that
the
union
had
made
no
request
to
distribute
literature
in
the
plant?
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
does
that
mean
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
--
that
the
company
could
not
distribute
unless
it
unilaterally
ex
parte,
so
to
speak,
notify
the
union
that
it
was
free
to
do
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it
had
to
relax
the
prohibition
even
though
there
was
no
request
by
the
union
that
it
should
be
relaxed.
