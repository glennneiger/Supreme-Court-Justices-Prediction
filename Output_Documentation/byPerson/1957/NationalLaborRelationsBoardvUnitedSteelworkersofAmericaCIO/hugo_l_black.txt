justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
this
court
has
said
several
times
i
think
that
at
least
on
the
constitutional
level,
that
the
fact,
if
there
are
other
avenues
to
which
a
person
might
talk
or
might
spread
his
views
in
writing
cannot
justify
discretion
of
his
views
in
one
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that.
if
you
are
saying
that
by
reason
of
the
ownership,
in
fact
of
the
wording
of
that,
and
i
don't
--
wanted
to
interrupt
you,
they
have
a
general
all
inclusive
rule
that
says,
talking
loud
is
bad
in
this
plant.
they
won't
have
it.
distributing
literature
is
bad
in
this
plant,
they
won't
have
it.
but
i
didn't
understand
you
putting
it
on
that
basis,
your
distinction
between
delivering
any
question
that
the
chief
asked
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
suppose
it
could
be
shown
that
the
employer
had
implemented
to
rent
a
hole
in
town.
there
are
plenty
of
holes
available
and
that
he
could
do
that,
would
that
have
any
--
would
that
have
a
relevance
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
he
was
doing
the
distributing
himself
and
--
or
speaking
himself
and
he
just
claimed
that
he
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
it
so
he
could
rent
a
hole.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
understand
that
but
you're
talking
--
are
you
talking
now
by
the
general
--
are
you
talking
about
one
where
he
limits
the
kind
of
information
to
be
distributed
in
that
plant,
according
to
what
he
wants
distributed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
same
subject?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
company
in
that
case
distribute
literature
at
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
rule
instead
of
saying
what
occurred
in
its
language
(inaudible)
than
is
stated
by
the
employees
that
no
person
who
is
in
this
plant
by
our
consent
shall
say
anything
favorable
to
alleviate
either
by
distributing
a
pamphlet
or
by
talk
but
any
person
who's
in
this
thing
may
freely
criticize
readily
either
by
pamphlets,
literature
or
--
or
by
speech.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
so
held?
and
what
is
the
difference
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap).
it
didn't
have
as
employees
or
not
employees.
suppose
the
employer
simply
declares
that
the
board
approved
the
rules
of
the
employer,
said
no
one
in
this
plant,
rightfully
in
his
plant,
shall
distribute
any
literature
favorable
to
alleviating.
but
he
may
be
free,
as
he
pleases,
to
distribute
literature
which
criticizes
labor
and
at
the
same
time,
no
person
rightfully
in
this
plant
may
--
he
can
talk
but
he
shall
not
say
anything
favorable
to
alleviating.
he
shall
be
free
at
all
times
to
criticize
labor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
what
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
effect
of
this
rule
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
would
you
say,
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
pursuing
that
