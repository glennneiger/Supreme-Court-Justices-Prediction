mr.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
this.
did
this
union
lack
to
distribute
in
the
plant?
is
there
any
evidence
that
they
did
want
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
there
was
no
request
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
is
there
any
evidence
that
to
bat
for
the
rule,
they
would
have
distributed
that
it's
a
sure
a
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
why
do
--
what
i
don't
quite
understand
is
then,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
that,
except
for
the
other
considerations
involved,
the
mere
existence
of
the
prohibition
whether
or
not
the
union
was
--
are
concerned
with
it
or
not
in
the
complaint
originally
filed
alleged
by
them
in
8
(a)
(1)
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
violation
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
it's
interference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
--
how
you
get
interference
if
they
didn't
want
to
distribute
any.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
well
--
well
how
did
the
--
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
arrive
at
an
interference
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
an
8
(1)
(a)
--
an
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they've
had
to
be
on
--
based
on
interference,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
mere
existence
of
the
rule
if
the
union
then
might
have
come
in
and
said
we're
not
withstanding,
the
--
the
disavowal
of
the
desire
to
distribute.
i
gather
the
--
you're
suggesting
that
the
statute
would
nevertheless,
at
least
in
the
court
of
appeals
view,
constitute
the
prohibition
to
constitute
a
violation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
at
least
that
much
have
to
be
presumed
in
order
to
find
the
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
come
back
again
and
even
in
the
express
disavowal
by
the
union
of
a
desire
to
distribute
might
nevertheless
subject
the
employer
to
discharge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
feller,
suppose
instead
of
distributing
the
seculars
among
his
employees,
he
had
read
them
over
a
loud
speaker
system
in
the
plant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
addressing
myself
to
this
rule
which
you
say,
if
the
employees
can't
litter,
he
can't
litter.
and
therefore
it
has
to
be
two-way
street.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
instead
of
littering,
he
chose
to
do
what
i've
said
then
the
litter
argument
rather
falls,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
it
did
not.
and
the
court
said,
“provided
that
the
rule
does
not
discriminate
--
and
i
think
this
is
almost
as
an
exact
quote,
“provided
that
the
rule
does
not
discriminate
against
the
union
by
permitting
other
distribution.”
and
the
court
said,
“the
question
as
to
non-employees
is
to
whether
there
are
other
channels
of
communication
open."
now,
what
the
board
has
tried
to
do
is
to
say,
that
this
is
the
standard
to
apply
to
employees
that
so
long
as
you
can't
show
that
you
can't
hand
out
(inaudible)
outside
the
plant,
we
can
prohibit
you
from
handing
them
out
inside
the
plant.
the
plant
inside
is
the
employer's
property,
that's
where
he
distributes.
outside
the
plant
that's
public
property,
you
can
distribute.
now,
this
goes
contrary
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
correct
and
i've
never
heard
it
disputed.
so,
a
very
simple
proposition
which
i
think
has
been
so
fundamental
to
the
development
of
this
law
in
this
field
that
it's
never
been
heretofore
controverted.
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
employer
owns
the
plant
premises.
premises
to
which
the
employees
had
been
invited
and
indeed
ordered
to
come
and
work,
does
not
give
him
the
right
to
restrict
what
they
say
to
each
other,
what
they
hand
to
each
other.
how
they
can
communicate
each
other
on
the
union
question
except
--
that
that's
prima
facie
in
interference
with
their
efforts
to
organize
themselves.
except
as
it
shown
either
by
the
particular
case
or
by
certain
presumptions
on
which
the
board
operates.
that's
the
activity
forbidden,
interfered
with,
is
such
that
would
interfere
with
efficient
production.
it
has
never
been
said
until
the
board's
brief
in
this
case
that
the
employer
can
make
such
restrictions
with
respect
to
employees
on
the
plant
premises
because
he
owns
the
plant.
