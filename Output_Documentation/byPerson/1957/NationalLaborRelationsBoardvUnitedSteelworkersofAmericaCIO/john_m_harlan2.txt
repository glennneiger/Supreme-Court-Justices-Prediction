justice
john
m.
harlan
what
did
the
board's
order
do
to
you
in
respect
to
solicitation
beyond
what
you've
just
described?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
the
board's
order
was
predicated
entirely
on
his
findings
of
the
specific
abusage
that
had
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
--
what
is
there
in
this
case
beyond
the
question
as
to
whether
we
should
apply
the
universal
camera
rule
or
whether
we
shouldn't?
is
there
anything
else?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
you
state
it,
i
can't
see
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
you
see
what
relationship
this
case
has
to
the
other
one.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
one
were
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
you
would
refer
him
in
the
first
case,
does
--
do
you
think
that
requires
a
reversal
in
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
what
i
can't
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
elaborate
that
because
i
can't
see
it
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
has
decided
no
such
issue.
it
hasn't
--
it
hasn't
said
in
the
solicitation
field,
if
you
won't
let
your
employees
solicit,
you
can't
solicit.
that's
the
issue
you
had
in
the
first
case.
here,
they
have
said,
you
can't
prevent
the
employees
from
soliciting
because
you
have
discriminatorily
used
that
program
yourself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
i
don't
want
cut
into
your
light
but
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
reaching
this
far
that
under
no
circumstances
can
you
have
a
non-distribution
rule
and
the
employer
make
a
non-distribution
rule
unless
it's
a
two-way
street?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
draw
no
distinction,
as
i
understand
it,
between
from
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
within
this
kind
of
a
case
and
the
case
where
the
union
had
made
a
request
in
a
particular
setting
saying
that
they
wanted
to
have
the
right
to
distribute
literature
as
well.
you
make
no
distinction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
doesn't.
