mr.
frank
a.
constangy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
the
statement
of
counsel
and
our
own
version
of
the
facts
arises
what
we
contend
as
actually
the
issue
here.
this
is
substantial
disputed
fact.
there
was
a
substantial
dispute
of
fact
between
the
parties,
between
the
board,
and
its
trial
examiner,
and
by
the
court
below
in
its
evaluation
of
the
board's
findings
of
fact.
that
dispute
permeates
this
matter
and
brings
the
matter
here.
unlike
the
no-solicitation
rule,
i
mean,
the
no
distribution
rule,
we
think
insofar
as
these
matters
have
been
consistent
in
their
holding.
the
rule
on
the
solicitation
has
been
relatively
consistent
for
a
long
time.
the
rules
on
solicitation
arise
out
of
the
peyton
packing
case,
which
was
affirmed
by
this
same
court
from
which
this
certiorari
was
taken
and
was
approved
by
this
court.
the
peyton
packing
case
in
the
last
analysis
adopts
the
premise
that
working
time
is
for
work
and
that
quoting
exactly
with
--
from
the
language
as
approved
by
this
court,
“it
is
therefore
within
the
province
of
an
employer
to
prohibit
and
enforce,
to
promulgate
and
enforce
a
rule,
prohibiting
union
solicitation
during
working
hours.
such
a
rule
must
be
presumed
valid
in
the
absence
of
evidence
that
it
was
adopted
for
discriminatory
purpose.”
fundamentally,
we
get
to
this
situation
here,
this
plant
doesn't
go
the
whole
way
if
the
court
please.
this
plant
has
only
one
limitation
insofar
as
its
employees
are
concerned.
and
that
--
and
that
limitation
is
that
they
may
not
engage
in
solicitation
during
the
time
that
they
are
actually
supposed
to
be
at
work,
or
of
people
who
actually
is
supposed
to
be
at
work.
that
means
that
they
solicit,
they
can
talk
about
the
union,
they
can
talk
about
anything
else,
during
all
of
the
time
they're
in
the
plant
except
those
times
when
the
nature
of
their
job
and
their
duties
require
their
attention
to
their
job.
now,
the
evidence
in
this
record
although
the
board
disregarded
it,
the
court
below
recognized
it,
was
that
this
room
was
a
rule
of
some
many
years
standing.
and
that
it
had
been
invoked
and
applied
in
matters
other
than
union
solicitation.
it
was
undisputed
evidence
that
a
man
was
reprimanded
for
soliciting
a
series
of
signatures
on
a
petition
to
get
his
son
parole
from
imprisonment
long
before
this
union
question.
and
he
was
warned
then
that
it
was
against
the
rules
to
solicit
during
working
hours.
now,
what
happened
in
very
simple
short
statement
was
this.
this
union
began
a
very
active
campaign.
it
gave
out
and
early
in
november
of
1954,
some
600
cards
according
to
the
evidence
to
get
signed
up.
it
became
apparent
to
the
supervisors
that
the
soliciting
of
signatures
on
these
cards
were
interfering
with
production.
there
was
testimony
about
men
being
grouped
up
in
the
hours.
there
was
testimony
about
people
leaving
their
jobs
and
going
to
other
departments.
and
the
respondent
in
keeping
with
the
rule
of
60
years
standing
and
a
practice
of
60
years
standing,
made
the
employees
aware
of
the
rule
in
exactly
the
same
way
it
made
them
--
made
them
aware
of
the
other
rules.
it
notified
the
people,
various
people,
that
the
rule
is
that
you
may
not
solicit
during
working
hours,
and
you
may
not
solicit
other
people
who
are
working.
and
we
are
putting
you
on
notice
that
if
in
the
future
you
violate
that
rule,
you
would
be
subject
to
discipline.
in
the
case
of
the
two
men
that
are
ultimately
before
this
court,
one
man
on
the
evening
before
engaged
in
solicitation
that
involved
his
leaving
his
own
work,
in
an
operating
machine
that
he
had
to
cut
off
to
leave
according
to
the
testimony,
and
going
across
the
room
to
another
employee,
several
times
during
the
course
of
the
evening,
where
that
employee
was
at
work,
and
soliciting
him
to
sign
a
union
card.
the
testimony
was
incidentally
that
that
employee
finally
signed
it,
so
he
leave
him
alone.
this
was
reported
to
his
supervisor.when
he
came
in
to
work
early
the
next
shift,
the
supervisor
called
him
in
and
called
his
attention
to
the
rule,
and
told
him
that
future
conduct
of
this
sort
would
subject
him
to
disciplinary
discharge.
the
evidence
shows
that
during
that
very
same
shift,
he
then
solicited
another
employee,
first,
while
the
employee
--
while
the
man
discharged
himself
was
at
work.
and
then,
after
he
have
gotten
off
from
work
and
the
man
that
succeeded
him
had
come
to
work,
and
was
working,
to
again
sign
--
to
sign
a
union
card,
and
he
was
discharged.
in
the
other
case,
although
counsel
belittles
the
--
the
facts
in
terms
of
soliciting
a
man
while
riding
on
the
elevator,
if
the
court
please,
that
was
not
the
fact
at
all.
it
was
a
man
who
had
been
reported
by
one
supervisor
as
leaving
his
department
to
go
into
another
department
to
solicit.
as
a
result
of
that
report,
he
was
called
in
and
cautioned
about
this
rule
and
warned
that
future
violation
would
lead
to
his
discharge.
within
the
same
week,
this
employee
went
again
into
this
department,
and
stopped
the
man
who
operates
an
elevator
which
isn't
a
passenger
elevator
at
all,
it's
a
freight
moving
vehicle,
at
a
place
where
neither
he
had
any
business
being
and
where
the
employee
should
not
have
stopped,
to
sign
a
union
card
and
to
help
him
solicit
other
people
in
this
employee's
department,
to
join
the
union.
this
was
observed
again
by
the
supervisor
and
reported
and
he
was
discharged.
in
the
second
case,
the
man
in
his
own
testimony
admitted
it.
in
the
first
case,
there
was
some
denial
but
there
was
a
credibility
finding.incidentally,
that
was
not
accepted
to
that
the
denial
was
not
believed.
now,
in
those
cases
if
the
court
please,
independently
of
the
no-solicitation
rule,
an
employer
has
a
right,
we
submit,
to
say
to
an
employee
when
you
are
supposed
to
be
at
work,
stay
on
your
job,
don't
engage
in
extraneous
activity
during
that
period
whether
it's
union
or
any
other
union
or
--
or
non-union,
or
any
other
activity.
and
if
an
employee
disregards
that
instruction,
under
the
act
itself,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
an
employer
has
a
right
to
discharge
for
that
independently
of
this
issue.
getting
further
into
this
matter,
into
the
question
of
solicitation
if
you
please,
if
the
court
please,
the
fundamental
here,
the
basic
reason
for
the
existence
of
an
industrial
establishment
is
the
work
time,
it's
work
time
of
the
employee.
and
that
is
the
only
thing.
and
that
is
the
only
time
that
this
respondent
has
restricted
solicitation.
now,
counsel
argues
that
the
board
found
that
the
respondent
engaged
in
solicitation
in
work
time
itself
and
that
that
was
discriminatory
and
violative
of
the
act.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
court
please,
that
isn't
what
the
board
found.
the
board
found
that
because
in
each
version,
the
employer
didn't
invoke
his
rule
until
after
the
union
began
soliciting.
and
two,
because
the
employer
didn't
invoke
its
rule
by
posting
a
notice
on
the
bulletin
board,
or
some
other
method
that
the
board
approved
of.
and
three,
because
the
employer
permitted
talking
of
any
kind
during
non-work
time.
and
four,
because
the
employer
didn't
show
the
extent
to
which
this
solicitation
interfered
with
production,
that
the
respondent
invoked
its
rule,
not
for
a
business
purpose,
but
for
a
purpose
of
stopping
or
interfering
with
organization.
the
trial
examiner
found
to
the
contrary
and
the
court
below
in
the
evaluation
of
the
evidence,
found
that
the
boards
inferences
which
were
contrary
to
the
evidence
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
and
the
court
found
one
that
there
was
no
validity
to
the
finding.
that
this
respondent
invoked
its
rule
for
the
purpose
of
interfering
with
the
employees'
rights
under
the
act
rather
than
for
a
legitimate
business
purpose.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
oh,
i
think
your
honor,
this
court
can
look
back
of
it,
but
i
think
this
court
has
said
in
the
excess
that
the
primary
responsibility
of
determining
whether
a
finding
of
the
board
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
is
a
function
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i'm
satisfied
that
in
this
court's
discretion,
it
could
review
a
factual
finding
too,
but
it
has
said
in
the
universal
camera
case
that
it
will
not.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
the
ultimate
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
court
below,
entered
his
appeal
from,
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
record
contains
substantial
evidence
to
support
certain
inferences
the
board
has
drawn,
because
everybody
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please
from
the
trial
examiner
right
after
the
board's
brief
in
this
court,
premise
this
case
on
the
rule
in
peyton
packing
company.
and
the
board
contending
that
the
facts
bring
it
within
the
exception
to
the
--
to
the
presumption,
the
court
below,
the
trial
examiner,
and
of
course
the
respondent
contending
that
the
facts
do
not
meet
the
--
the
exceptions
to
peyton
packing.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
in
part,
it
disagreed
with
the
trial
examiner
in
part.
it
agreed
--
disagreed
with
the
board
in
part.
you
see,
the
trial
--
there
were
three
discharges
in
this
case
originally.
the
trial
examiner
held
all
three
of
them
were
valid.
the
board
held
that
all
three
of
them
were
illegal.
the
court
held
that
one
was
--
was
illegal
and
two
were
valid
under
the
circumstances
before
the
court.
the
other
factor
in
this
case
which
we
think
is
extremely
significant
if
the
court
please,
is
the
fact
that
insofar
as
the
so-called
8
(a)
(1)
violation
is
of
concern.
the
testimony
in
the
record
and
incidentally
respondent
did
not
accept
and
do
not
resist
enforcement
in
the
court
below
of
the
findings
of
8
(a)
(1)
except
insofar
as
it
related
to
the
discharges
in
the
no-solicitation
rule.
but
the
court
below
recognized
as
the
trial
examiner
recognized
that
there
must
be
some
reasonable
relationship
between
this
alleged
coercive
and
acts
in
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
the
so-called
no-solicitation
doctrine.
there
were
several
cases.
there
are
not
too
many
of
these
instances
that
involve
half
a
dozen
supervisors
conceivably
with
over
5000
employees
involved.
there
were
several
instances
of
interrogation.
incidentally
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
by
his
question,
it
was
exactly
the
same
sort
of
interrogation
that
was
involved
in
the
nutone
case.
there
were
several
instances
of
conversation,
in
which
in
supervisors
expressed
opinions
which
taken
in
context
were
construed
to
be
threats,
threats
that
conceivably
the
plant
might
close.
there
were
one
or
two
instances
of
very,
very
close
statements
where
the
trial
examiner
in
effect
said
that
taken
as
stated,
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
act
but
in
--
the
employee
could've
construed
it
to
be
a
threat.
now,
insofar
as
the
two
employees
here
are
concerned,
the
two
dischargees,
there
was
no-solicitation
of
them
to
do
anything
except
to
stay
on
the
jobs.
and
that
they
refused
to
do
and
they
were
disciplined
for
it.
and
there
was
no
dispute
about
that.
but
if
an
employee
must
establish
as
the
board
contends
here,
one,
not
only
that
there
is
some
business
purpose
in
it's
restricting
work
time
to
work,
but
also
must
establish
the
extent
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
the
board
that
these
activities
interfere
with
work
and
must
promulgate
the
rule
in
accordance
with
some
set
formula
that
the
board
favors
and
must
thereafter
be
restricted
from
interfering
with
virtually
a
carte
blanche
authority
of
employees
to
walk
off
their
jobs
when
they
please,
to
engage
in
other
activities,
simply
because
some
supervisor
has
gone
over
the
line
in
some
point.
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
board
has
undertaken
not
to
administer
the
act
but
to
set
a
whole
philosophy
of
industrial
operations
of
that
kind.
now,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
board's
orders
enforced
by
the
court,
there
are
specific
findings
that
the
employer
shall
not
do
this,
that
or
the
other.
that
he
shall
take
certain
affirmative
actions.
and
if
he
fails
or
if
he
violates
him
again,
he
is
obviously
subject
to
contempt.
now,
those
unfair
labor
practices
as
found
by
the
board
and
as
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
or
by
virtue
of
the
decree
of
the
court
below
rectified,
he
is
prohibited,
he
is
required
to
make
the
necessary
posting
that
he
will
cease
and
desist
from
this
conduct
and
he
is
prohibited
from
engaging
in
it
in
the
future,
including,
if
the
court
please,
a
prohibition
against
the
supervisors
soliciting
employees
to
withdraw
from
the
union.
there
was
one
incident.
an
incident
that
the
record
shows
he
was
not
doing
work
outs
of
a
conversation
between
a
supervisor
and
an
employee
in
which
he
said
to
the
employee
in
substance.
don't
you
think
you
ought
to
get
your
card
back?
or,
don't
you
want
your
card
bank?
the
board
within
its
province
of
interpretation
has
held
that
any
solicitation
of
withdrawal
from
a
union
is
a
violation
to
the
act.
whether
i
accept
that
premise
or
not,
the
respondent
did
not
accept
to
it
insofar
as
a
petition
for
enforcement
is
concerned.
and
these
orders
enforced
by
the
court
prohibits
the
employer
and
his
supervisors
from
soliciting
withdrawals
from
the
union.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
the
only
other
thing
it
did
was
in
it
in
effect
said
that
you
may
not
enforce
a
no-solicitation
rule
in
the
same
discriminatory
manner
as
you
have.
that
--
that
isn't
quite
the
language.
but
the
implication
of
it
was
that
if
you're
supervisors,
at
any
time
violates
section
8
(a)
(1)
you
may
not
impose
a
no-solicitation
rule,
that's
the
--
the
import.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
that's
right.
if
the
court
please,
insofar
as
the
application
of
the
rule
concern
us,
the
court
below
held
in
one
of
the
three
cases
it
--
before
it
that
the
employee
did
not
apply
the
rule
in
a
legal
manner.
it
held
that
this
man,
i
think
his
name
is
jones,
as
i
recollect.
jones
was
discharged
not
because
he
violated
the
no-solicitation
rule,
because
he
literally
didn't
solicit
during
working
hours.he
--
he
actually
--
according
to
some
disputed
testimony,
asked
a
man
of
giving
back
the
card
that
he'd
given
him
outside
the
plant
that
was
signed.
but
in
this
instance,
the
evidence
show
that
a
man
or
personnel
clerk
had
been
sent
by
the
supervisor
to
jones
to
ask
him
to
refrain
from
the
union
activities.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
as
far
as
i
--
i
see
it,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
the
board
has
--
has
taken
in
its
brief,
in
a
completely
opposite
position
here
than
its
taken
in
nutone
within
its
decision
in
order,
all
the
board
has
done
is
raised
the
factual
questions
covered
by
universal
camera.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
i
--
if
the
court
please,
we
can't
see
it
either
because
here
we
have
a
rule.
the
board
has
not
in
--
in
avondale
annunciated
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
counsel
a
minute
ago,
some
new
general
rule,
the
rule
in
avondale
is
the
peyton
packing
rule.
and
the
peyton
packing
rule
is
purely
an
evidentiary
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
a
certain
conduct
brings
it
within
the
exceptions,
or
brings
it
in
the
presumption
of
the
validly
of
the
rule.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
may
i
answer
that
two
ways,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
first
of
all,
i
think
the
board
conceivably
could
have
--
could
evolve
such
a
rule
of
law,
but
i
still
think
it
would
be
subject
to
a
good
many
questions
both
as
to
its
authority
and
the
factual
basis
of
it.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
yes,
but
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
incidentally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
obviously
the
board
hasn't
evolved
the
rule
of
law
because
it
supplied
an
entirely
different
rule
to
the
same
substantial
facts
in
nutone
as
avondale.
in
avondale,
you
have
discriminatory
discharges.
in
nutone,
you
have
discriminatory
discharges.
in
avondale,
you
had
discriminatory
or
illegal
interrogation.
in
nutone,
you
had
the
illegal
interrogation.
you
have
other
violations
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
yet,
in
avondale,
in
con
--
dealing
with
the
essence
of
industrial
management,
work
time,
the
board
says
that
if
you
do
these
things,
you
are
deprived
of
your
right,
to
hold
the
man
on
his
job
during
work
time.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
but,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
in
the
nutone
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
there
is
no
distinct
--
because
also
in
nutone,
there
was
a
no-solicitation
rule,
which
somehow
and
other
in
the
shuffling
of
the
case
ceased
to
be
an
issue.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
but
the
board
didn't
say
in
nutone,
that
your
no-solicitation
rule
is
illegal.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
in
--
in
nutone?
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
that
only
insofar
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
as
the
distribution
is
concerned.
yes,
you're
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
but
not
insofar
as
any
of
the
other
facets
of
the
case
were
concerned
because
every
--
every
factor
that
exist
in
avondale
existed
in
nutone,
except
that
the
ultimate
issue
that
the
board
has
drawn
on
appeal
is
one
in
the
application
of
the
no-distribution
rule
which
is
certainly
a
less
attribute
to
production
than
the
no-work
time
rule
which
is
a
major
attribute
to
production.
and
they
come
up
with
entirely
diametrically
opposed
propositions
on
the
major
and
the
minor
purpose
of
this
thing,
with
the
factual
background
virtually
identical
for
all
practical
purposes.
so
they
couldn't
be
a
new
rule
evolved
in
avondale
unless
the
board
has
evolved
the
rule
that
applies
to
avondale,
period.
and
then,
it
becomes
a
universal
camera
matter.
it's
a
factual
matter
in
here.
we
--
we
make
one
further
point
if
the
court
please,
and
that
is
even
if
we
get
into
the
premise
that
the
board
argues
with
the
validity
of
nutone,
obviously,
the
full
gambit
of
accommodation
is
accomplished
when
employees
are
only
restricted
from
utilizing
the
employer's
premises
doing
the
one
circumstance
that
it
is
at
the
time
that
they're
suppose
to
be
giving
their
attention
to
their
jobs.
they
can
solicit,
they
can
talk,
they
can
literally
distribute
literature
during
lunch
hours,
during
smoking
periods,
in
the
restrooms,
before
shift,
after
shift,
in
the
plant
property.
the
only
thing
that
they're
restricted
from
is
using
the
time
when
their
attention
should
be
at
the
machine,
to
engage
in
some
extraneous
activity.
now,
that
draws
with
it
if
the
court
please,
a
rather
fundamental
distinction
between
the
function
and
duty
of
a
supervisor,
and
the
function
and
duty
of
the
attendant
of
a
machine.
without
going
into
it,
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
a
supervisor
even
though
he
may
ultimately
step
over
the
line
of
legality,
inherently
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
determine
from
an
employer
standpoint
when
production
might
be
interrupted
without
loss,
that
an
employee
who
simply
takes
literally
a
french
leave
whenever
he
--
the
notion
strikes
it.
and
that,
we
submit
is
also
inherent
in
this
distinction
that
the
board
seeks
to
draw.
this
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
to
the
extent
that
they
enforce
it
only
during
the
time
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
when
they
have
determined
that
an
employee
should
devote
his
attention
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
to
his
--
to
his
job?
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
i
--
i
think
that
is
the
law
--
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
--
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
might
answer
you
in
using
the
language
of
justice
miller
in
the
woolworth
case,
it's
a
sentence.
but
ultimately,
justice
miller
in
his
conquering
opinion
to
the
woolworth
case
said
that
neither
the
constitution,
the
common
law,
nor
the
labor
management
relations
act
confers
upon
the
employees
the
right
to
use
for
union
purposes
the
property
of
their
employer
during
working
hours
over
the
objection
of
the
employee.
now,
literally,
whether
we
call
it
in
inherent
element
of
property
or
ownership
or
whether
we
call
it
a
part
of
the
relationship
that
exist
by
virtue
of
the
employer's
right
to
control
or
diminish
production
as
he
sees
fit
because
ultimately
it's
his
production,
if
the
court
please.
the
employer
has
a
right,
we
submit,
to
interfere
with
working
time,
which
is
his
working
time,
and
at
the
same
time,
to
prohibit
anyone
else
from
interfering
with
his
working
time.
so
long
as
he
draws
the
line
there
and
does
not
carry
it
beyond
the
point
of
working
time
to
non-working
time,
plant
time,
and
the
related
times.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
no,
sir.
if
you
affirm
the
first
case,
then
the
very
ultimate
premise
of
the
second
--
i'm
sorry,
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
the
affirming
in
the
first
case
would
be
affirming
on
the
accommodation,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
gets
to
the
question
in
our
case
which
is
that
it's
a
factual
issue
in
a
different
rule.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
on
the
other
hand,
a
reversal
in
the
first
case
would
knock
the
ground
completely
out
of
the
premise
of
the
board's
position.
mr.
frank
a.
constangy
well,
the
point
--
the
point
is
--
this
issue,
if
your
honor
please,
that
comes
in
my
--
in
the
avondale
case
is
a
pure
and
simple
determination
of
whether
the
facts
in
this
record
bring
it
within
the
exemption
of
peyton
packing
or
do
not.
that's
the
premise
that
the
whole
thing
is
bottomed
on.
that
is,
was
the
rule
invoked
for
business
purpose
or
was
it
invoked
to
disturb,
to
interfere
with
the
organization
rights
of
the
employee.
and
that
is
a
factual
question
because
the
board's
decision
was
a
determination
of
the
respondent's
motive,
not
anything
else.and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
simply
did
not
sustain
that
determination.
