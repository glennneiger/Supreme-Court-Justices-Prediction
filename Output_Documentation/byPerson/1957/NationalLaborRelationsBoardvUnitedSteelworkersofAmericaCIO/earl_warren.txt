mr.
manoli,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
reduce
it
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
littering
or
not
littering?
is
that
the
only
distinction
you
make
between
the
--
the
solicitation
and
the
literature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wherein
does
that
differ
from
the
factual
situation
in
the
case
you've
just
been
starting
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
my
point
being
this
if
there
were
unfair
labor
practices
there
that
amounted
to
coercion,
it
fired
employees
because
of
union
activities
and
so
forth,
how
is
it
that
you
can
so
easily
separate
those
from
the
--
from
this
rule
that
he
had
broke
himself
in
that
case,
and
then
bind
them
together
so
closely
in
this
case?

mr.
constangy
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
you
--
does
your
argument
go
to
the
limit
of
saying
that
in
the
absence
of
coercion,
the
supervisors
or
any
others
in
the
--
in
the
plant
who
are
authorized
by
the
employer
to
do
so,
may
interrupt
to
talk
to
the
--
the
other
employees
at
any
time,
in
any
place
against
the
labor
unions,
and
still
be
in
the
position
to
enforce
the
law
against
no-solicitation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.

to

chief

yes.

you

mr.

chief

mr.
manoli.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
other
--
any
other
unfair
labor
practices
connected
with
this
mr.
manoli?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
manoli
do
you
--
do
you
consider
that
we
can
--
that
we
need
not
to
take
in
into
consideration
these
other
unfair
labor
practices
in
resolving
this
case
or
do
they
constitute
a
part
of
the
record
for
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
attach
any
legal
significance
to
the
fact
that
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
that
the
union
did
not
formally
request
permission
to
do
it
or
do
you
believe
that
notwithstanding
any
request
on
their
part
the
rule
would
be
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
--
so
you
merely
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
attach
no
significance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
thought
in
this
case
they
weren't
permitted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
owing
to
that
extent
this
rule
is
bad?
chief
justice
earl
warren
although
they
--
in
challenging
no
--
distribution
rule,
do
they
have
to
challenge
every
particular
face
of
it
in
order
to
--
to
substantially
raise
the
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
although
there
was
no
request
for
distribution
did
they
actually
distribute
any
--
any
literature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
union
did
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
feller.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
pursuing
that
to
the
other
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
you
properly
because
it's
highly
relevant,
if
you
think
but
whether
conclusive
or
not
both
congress
passed
the
law
which
said
that
throughout
the
united
states
as
people
are
engaged
in
the
interstate
commerce,
no
person
in
an
industrial
plant
shall
have
the
right
to
say
anything,
even
in
writing,
or
by
the
spoken
word
favorable
to
alleviate
but
they
shall
be
free
at
all
times
to
distribute
literature
or
to
talk
against
alleviating.
what
would
you
say
about
that
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
briefly,
yes.
