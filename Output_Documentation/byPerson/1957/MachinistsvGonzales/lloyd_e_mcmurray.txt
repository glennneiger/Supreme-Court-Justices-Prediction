mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
the
respondent
states
two
positions
so
to
speak
in
this
case.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i'll
try
to
focus
it,
your
honor.
there
--
i
think
that
first
of
all,
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
in
which
this
court
can
consider
the
question,
whether
a
state
court
can
award
damages
to
one
who
has
been
expelled
from
a
trade
union
even
if
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved
in
the
case.
i
think
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
supports
or
would
support
a
finding
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
this
case.
but
secondly,
i
say
that
if
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
fact
here
that
the
award
made
by
the
state
court
was
an
appropriate
award,
it
does
not
conflict
with
the
federal
jurisdiction
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
nor
purport
to
supplant
it
in
any
way,
but
it
is
a
proper
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
state
court
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
unincorporated
associations
within
its
borders.
and
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
argue
the
second
position
first.
assume
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
here
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
when
your
honor
says
the
gravamen
of
the
state
claime,
do
you
mean
the
gravamen
of
the
--
of
the
respondent's
claim?
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
the
cause
of
action
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
it
is
not
based
upon
the
existence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
in
fact
nobody
supposed
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
was
involved
in
this
case
at
all
until
the
case
was
on
appeal
before
the
district
court
of
appeals.
the
--
the
question
of
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board
was
not
raised,
the
question
that
this
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
raised
until
the
case
was
on
appeal
and
it
was
tried
entirely
on
the
theory
that
the
plaintiff,
the
respondent
here
had
--
had
his
contract
right,
that
is
his
right
to
have
the
union
abide
by
its
own
rules
in
--
in
holding
a
trial
and
disciplining
a
member.
it
had
that
right
violated.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it's
not
quite
that
broad.
he
couldn't
secure
employment
by
being
dispatched
from
the
union
hall
and
that
was
the
right
which
he
had
as
a
union
member.
he
may
have
been
able
to
secure
employment,
but
he
could
not
--
he
was
denied
the
right
which
he
had
as
a
union
member
and
that
was
the
gravamen
of
his
action.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that's
right.
the
--
the
parties
during
the
trial
of
this
case
were
unconcerned
with
the
question
of
whether
this
was
the
only
way
one
could
obtain
employment
or
with
the
question
whether
there
was
--
this
was
a
--
an
unfair
labor
practice,
a
discrimination
by
employers
caused
by
the
union.
this
question
was
not
raised.
my
learned
brother
stated
in
--
in
a
statement
of
the
case
that
there
was
a
preferential
hiring
agreement
for
example
--
preferential
hiring
arrangement,
excuse
me,
he
said.
now,
it's
true
that
there
was
five
months
after
gonzales
was
expelled
from
the
union,
there
was
a
--
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
which
had
some
aspects
of
preference,
but
it
was
by
no
means
a
union
shop
or
close
shop
agreement
at
all.
it's
set
forth
in
the
--
the
pertinent
portions
of
it
are
set
forth
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
at
page
4
and
said
in
there
that
the
employer
agreed
to
advice
the
union
of
all
job
openings
and
agreed
to
consider
for
employment,
a
man
referred
by
the
union
that
didn't
agree
to
take
them
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
well,
this
goes
to
the
question.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
now,
this
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
as
i
see
it,
because
i
believe
that
in
order
to
establish
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you
have
to
show
that
the
union
caused
the
employer
to
discriminate
and
if
you
have
a,
let's
say
if
you
could
have
a
closed
shop
contract
and
the
--
and
this
was
abided
by
in
practice
and
a
man
was
not
referred
then
there
will
be
no
question
about
it
at
all
but
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that's
correct.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
was
and
it
has
been.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
law
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
the
first
opinion
affirmed
it
as
to
--
affirmed
the
decision
as
to
reinstatement
in
the
union
which
was
the
major
relief
sought,
but
on
the
ground
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board
was
exclusive
so
far
as
damages
were
concerned,
a
compensation
for
lost
wages
were
concerned,
the
court
reversed
that
portion
of
the
judgment.
however,
on
rehearing
and
reconsidering,
the
court
came
to
just
the
opposite
conclusion
and
felt
that
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
involved
here
that
the
award
of
damages
was
granted
for
a
violation
of
a
contract
right
and
that
it
was
proper
for
the
court
to
award
that.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
--
the
--
the
only
portion
of
the
judgment
that
the
petitioners
have
sought
to
have
reviewed
here
is
the
portion
which
awards
damages.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes
and
to
the
extent
that
there
might
be
other
remedies
which
will
be
available
in
the
state
courts.
they
are
barred
and
the
respondent
is
barred
from
them
by
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
the
damages
were
directed,
your
honor
to
two
things.
one
was
wages
lost
by
the
respondent
because
he
was
unable
to
obtain
dispatch
from
the
hiring
hall.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that
would
be
possible,
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
is.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
secondly,
it
was
for
the
humiliation,
degradation,
anxiety
that
gonzales
suffered.
he
had
been
a
--
a
very
prominent
member
of
the
union,
a
member
of
the
board
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that
is
a
--
a
subsidiary
question,
but
one
which
i
hope
the
court
will
not
have
to
consider
because
i
believe,
your
honor
that
the
--
that
the
award
of
the
court
was
quite
proper
in
the
--
in
the
first
instance
that
the
court
has
the
power
in
this
kind
of
a
case
to
deal
by
award
of
damages
as
well
as
a
decree
restoring
the
petitioner
that
is
the
--
he
was
the
petitioner
there
and
he's
respondent
here
to
membership
in
the
trade
union.
i
should
like
to
state
briefly
why.
i
think
that
this
is
true
because
first
of
all,
the
activity
which
the
state
court
dealt
with
was
not
the
activity
which
the
board
would
deal
with.
the
--
the
board
was
--
would
be
concerned
with
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that
is
with
action
by
the
union
which
would
cause
the
employers
to
discriminate
against
the
respondent.
the
court
was
not
concerned
with
that
at
all.
the
court
granted
its
judgment
in
two
parts.
one
of
them,
the
major
thing
that
was
sought
was
a
decree,
a
mandate,
a
writ
of
mandate
directing
the
union
to
reinstate
the
petitioner
to
--
that
is
the
respondent
there,
gonzales,
to
membership
in
the
union.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i'm
--
i'm
not
quite
certain,
your
honor.
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
not
into
the
union,
no.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
not
into
the
union.
this
is
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
it
is.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that
is
so,
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
why
the
--
the
board
cannot
--
could
not
order
reinstatement
in
the
union,
it
could
order
reinstatement
on
the
job,
but
not
in
the
union.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that's
correct,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
believe
not.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
no,
i
--
i
think
that
the
proviso
that
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned
awhile
ago
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
--
is
what
governs
that.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
think
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
man
was
within
the
situation,
suppose
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
the
man
was
correctly
or
incorrectly
expelled
that
what
the
act
is
aimed
at
is
that
membership
in
the
union
accepts
under
a
proper
union
security
agreement
is
not
to
govern
a
man's
right
to
--
to
work.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
now,
if
i
--
if
i
may
continue
to
discuss
--
in
discussing
why
i
believe
that
even
if
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
fact
here,
the
state
court
nevertheless
have
jurisdiction.
first
of
all,
it
is
because
the
state
court
was
dealing
with
--
with
activity
which
is
not
within
the
province
of
the
board
to
deal
with
at
all
and
it
was
seeking
to
regulate
its
control
activity
which
the
board
would
not
be
regulating
if
there
were
a
complaint
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charged
before
him
and
unless
i'm
wrong
in
my
last
answer
to
your
last
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
then,
the
further
reason
is
that
the
state
court
was
not
confronted
with
any
question
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
with
any
question
of
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board
at
any
time
during
the
proceeding
until
the
matter
was
up
on
appeal.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that
i
think
must
be
understood.
the
answer
that's
--
that
counsel
referred
to
--
mr.
papps
referred
to
is
found
in
the
record
at
page
13,
the
portion
of
the
answer
upon
which
he
relies
is
as
follows
that
the
plain,
speedy
and
adequate
remedy
in
the
ordinary
course
of
law
is
available
to
the
petitioner
under
provisions
of
sections
8
(b)
(1)
and
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
now,
that
might
seem
at
first
blush
to
raise
a
question
or
at
least
intimate
that
there
are
some
problem
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
here
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court,
the
california
court
did
say
that
the
petitioner
and
that
is
the
petitioner
here,
the
union
raised
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
i
think
it
was
an
error
there
though
that
the
purpose
of
raising
this
was
to
show
that
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
was
not
entitled
to
come
into
the
court
of
equity.
in
--
in
california
at
least,
the
writ
of
mandate
is
regarded
as
a
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
they
haven't
said
that
it
was
accurately
raised.
they
say
on
the
contrary
that
it
was
not
raised,
that
it's
not
a
--
an
issue.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
no.
they
mentioned
--
the
court
mentions
in
passing
that
there
was
the
answer
spoke
about
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
but
i
don't
believe
it
did.
i
think
that
was
--
i
was
wrong
and
it
certainly
is
not
the
holding
of
this
case.
the
holding
is
just
the
opposite
that
no
federal
question
was
raised.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
the
federal
problem
was
certainly
injected
in
the
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
--
in
the
appellate
--
the
appellate
level,
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
except
that
if
the
--
if
the
federal
question,
perhaps
i
--
i've
missed
--
i
haven't
stated
this
clearly,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
--
when
i
say
that
the
federal
question
was
not
raised,
i
mean
that
the
question
of
the
conduct
which
the
federal
agency
would
regulate
was
not
before
the
court.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
because
after
the
case
was
tried,
the
union
came
in
to
the
appellate
court
and
said,
“we've
been
committing
an
unfair
labor
practices
here
and
this
case
doesn't
belong
in
here
at
all,”
but
they
had
the
--
the
issues
upon
which
the
--
the
case
was
tried
and
the
evidence
upon
which
the
case
was
decided
both
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
appellate
courts
did
not
deal
with
any
such
thing.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
certainly,
it's
in
the
case
for
your
purpose.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
not
quite,
your
honor.
it
isn't
true
as
i
understand
california
law
that
the
appellate
court
could
have
said,
“well,
this
wasn't
tried,
so
this
issue
isn't
before
us,”
because
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
can
always
be
raised.it
can
be
raised
anytime.
but
when
you
raised
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
you
have
to
have
--
when
you
raise
it
in
an
appellate
court
at
any
rate,
you
have
to
have
some
evidence
upon
which
to
show
that
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
right,
but
the
fact
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
mean
that
the
federal
question
was
not
raised
by
the
pleadings
below.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
no.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
a
conclusion
and
i
think
it
was
correct
that
it
was
dealing
with
something
that
the
federal
agency
would
not
deal
with.
that
was
reinstated
in
the
union
that
that
was
the
primary
thing
it
was
concerned
with.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
can
you
review
that
question?
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
of
course,
it
can.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
anything
that
is
not
here
for
your
consideration.
well,
i
said
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
case.
i
didn't
mean
that
you
cannot
say,
“we
will
assume
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
here.”
and
then
go
ahead
and
decide.
you've
done
this
in
other
cases.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
think
that
if
you'd
look
at
the
record,
you
will
find
it
does
not
justify
it,
because
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
employers
were
caused
to
discriminate
by
the
union
or
that
the
union
was
in
possession
so
to
speak
of
the
labor
market
in
which
gonzales
worked
or
that
the
union
was
able
to
prevent
him
from
obtaining
employment
except
that
it
didn't
refer
him
as
a
union
member
had
a
right
to
be
referred
from
its
hall.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
perhaps
i
do.
i
also
mean
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
--
i
didn't
want
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
i
think
that
i
mean
something
a
little
more
than
that
it's
not
appropriate
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
--
to
decide
it
against
me.
i
think
i
mean
that
a
decision
in
this
case
on
the
question
which
i
take
it,
this
case
is
supposed
to
test
whether
a
state
court
has
power
to
grant
damages
to
a
union
member
who's
been
expelled,
illegally
expelled
from
his
union
even
where
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
the
board
could
take
jurisdiction
of.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
a
decision
on
that
question
in
this
case
will
be
illuminating
to
the
bar,
to
the
parties,
to
the
people
who
are
concerned
with
this
question
because
the
existence
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
is
so
inferential
only.
it
isn't
established.
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
take
some
long
jumps
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
the
board
should
have
or
could
have
taken
cognizance
of.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
am.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
am.
it
is
my
position,
but
i
think
that
--
that
i
must
address
my
--
my
argument
to
the
proposition
that
assuming
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
here
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
two
things.
first,
my
fear
that
the
court
might
disagree
with
me
on
whether
there
is
a
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
record
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
--
and
i
wouldn't
then
have
argued
--
yes,
and
i
would
not
then
have
argued
the
--
the
tougher
question,
suppose
there
is
one
there.
now,
the
other
thing
is
that
just
exactly
what
is
required
to
establish
the
existence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
not
such
a
clear
and
certain
thing.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
was
saying
that
i
would
like
(inaudible)
first
and
that
--
in
that
regard,
the
first
thing
that
i
say
demonstrates
that
there
was
no
--
that's
--
what's
not
within
the
area
in
which
the
board
can
act
as
a
fact
that
the
activity
regulated
by
the
state-court
judgment
was
not
the
same
as
that
with
which
the
board
would
be
concerned.
the
second
ground
and
serve
a
corollary
of
that
is
this,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
congress
intended
by
the
passage
of
the
--
of
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act
to
take
complete
control
of
absolutely
every
aspect
of
the
activities
of
man
in
which
an
unfair
labor
practice
might
be
involved
in
some
way.
and
i
have
put
to
my
learned
opponents
this
hypothetical
question
which
they
have
not
answered.let
us
suppose
that
an
employer
wants
to
get
rid
of
a
--
of
a
man
because
he's
a
good
union
member
and
so
he
fires
him,
but
he
says
to
the
other
employees
in
the
plant
that
he
fired
him
because
he
stole
money
or
goods.
now,
the
real
purpose
of
the
employer,
the
real
intent,
and
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
content
is
very
important,
is
to
get
rid
of
the
strong
union
man.
but,
in
so
doing,
he
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
also
he
commits
a
--
an
active
defamation
which
is
a
tort
under
the
law
of
most
states,
not
all,
would
be
employee
who
was
fired,
be
unable
to
sue
in
the
state
court
for
damages,
for
defamation
in
that
situation,
i
say
that
i
--
i've
seen
no
cases
on
this,
at
all,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
labor
act
should
be
so
broadly
construed
as
to
exclude
from
the
state
courts
such
tort
jurisdiction
as
that.
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
evils
of
conflict
between
the
federal
control
of
labor
matters,
and
state
control
would
flow
from
allowing
such
an
action.
and
i
would
move
on
then
to
the
third
reason
why
i
think
this
was
within
the
state's
jurisdiction.
an
award
of
damages
was
made
here
and
this
is
one
of
the
--
this
is
the
thing
that
--
that
brought
the
case
up
here,
not
the
fact
that
--
that
gonzales
was
ordered
reinstated
to
the
union
but
the
fact
that
damages
were
awarded.
does
that
indicate
that
the
--
that
this
should
be
before
the
board
and
not
in
the
courts?
i
say
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
no,
it
should
not.
the
fact
that
damages
were
awarded
does
not
mean
that
the
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
i
would
point
to
your
recent
decision
in
--
in
san
diego
building
trades
council
against
garmon
in
which
the
court
there
admittedly
dealing
with
an
unfair
labor
practice,
one
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
refused
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
on
and
under
the
idea
that
it
must
follow
the
federal
law,
the
california
court
awarded
damages
as
well
as
injunction
and
this
court,
while
holding
that
the
power
to
enjoin
was
exclusively
federal,
that
is
that
the
--
the
court,
the
state
court
had
no
power
to
issue
the
injunction,
did
not
reverse
as
to
the
award
of
damages
but
merely
vacated
the
judgment
and
said
that
it
wasn't
sure.
this
court
wasn't
sure
what
the
california
court
meant.
apparently,
the
california
court
might
mean
that
under
its
law,
an
award
of
damages
would
be
proper
in
such
a
situation.
and
if
that
was
so,
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
intimated
that
the
california
court
should
make
that
clear
and
then
could
--
could
properly
award
the
damages.
and
that's
the
final
reason
why
i
think
this
is
within
the
power
of
the
state
court
is
because
the
state
court
was
the
only
tribunal
which
could
afford
complete
relief.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
dwell
on
the
policy
reason
for
favoring
a
tribunal
which
can
afford
complete
relief.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
the
appropriateness
of
allowing
power
to
remain
in
a
court
which
can
dispose
of
the
entire
controversy
in
two
recent
cases.
one
of
them
is
syres
against
the
oil
workers
union
and
more
recently
in
conley
against
gibson
where
this
court
noted
that
only
there
was
a
--
some
flavor
of
a
labor
dispute
about
the
case
that
if
i
may
quote
from
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
for
the
court.
“this
case
involves
no
dispute
between
employee
and
employer
but
to
the
contrary
is
a
suit
by
employees
against
the
bargaining
agent
to
enforce
their
statutory
right
not
to
be
unfairly
discriminated
against
by
it
in
bargaining.
the
adjustment
board
has
no
power
to
protect
them
from
such
discrimination.
furthermore,
the
contract
between
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroad
will
be,
at
most,
only
incidentally
involved
in
resolving
this
controversy
between
petitioners
and
their
bargaining
agent.
in
those
two
cases,
the
syres
case
and
this
case
although
some
relief
was
available
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
this
court
said
that
a
district
court,
federal
district
court
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
an
injunction
and
to
give
relief
without
requiring
the
workers
to
go
before
the
board
to
obtain
what
relief
the
board
could
give
them.
if
i
may
now,
i
should
like
to
state
why
i
say
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
clearly
show
any
unfair
labor
practice.
i
think
that
it
boils
down
to
this
that
the
statute
requires
whether
to
be
unfair
labor
practice
that
the
union
must
have
caused
the
employer
to
discriminate
against
the
employee.
and
while
it
is
true
that
this
does
not,
under
the
decided
cases,
mean
that
you
have
to
show
that
the
union
wrote
a
letter
or
went
and
talked
to
the
employer
and
demanded
that
he
not
hire
the
employee,
some
evidence
of
that
causal
relationship
must
be
given.
and,
of
course,
it
would
be
very
simple,
it
would
have
been
very
simple
for
the
--
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case
to
do
that
if
there
had
been
such
evidence
available.
they
could
have
called
a
union
official
or
they
could
have
called
a
--
an
employer.
they
could
have
established
without
any
difficulty,
whatever,
that
the
union
was
the
one
who
caused
the
discrimination,
if
there
was
discrimination.
but
the
--
was
the
theory
of
the
union,
the
petitioner
here,
at
the
trial
level
that
there
was
no
causal
relationship
whatever,
that
the
union
was
not
in
anyway
responsible
for
gonzales'
failure
to
obtain
work
and
mr.
kennedy,
my
learned
opponent
in
the
trial
court
stated
to
the
court
a
probable
theory
why
gonzales
was
unable
--
unable
to
obtain
work.
it's
set
forth
at
my
briefs
page
61
of
the
record.
the
court
asked
him,
“is
there
any
question
about
the
fact
that
if
he
had
been
a
full-pledged
member
of
the
union
according
to
your
contention
that
he
would
have
employment?
and
mr.
kennedy
said,
“that's
what
i
was
trying
to
raise
as
a
matter
here,
your
honor.
the
history
will
show
that
there
may
well
have
been
and
i
can't
state
one
way
or
another
that
--
one
way
or
another
that
there
may
have
been
reasons
why
certain
of
these
employers
would
not
want
to
employ
mr.
gonzales.
i'm
not
stating
they
did
exist
but
for
example
in
some
of
the
employment
that
he
had,
he
had
the
misfortune
to
become
injured.”
now,
conceivably
that
would
be
one
of
the
grounds
for
refusing
him
employment.
what
--
what
we
are
doing
here
is
we're
taking
mr.
gonzales'
version
of
a
third
party
statement
and
the
only
purpose
of
it
is
to
ascribe
to
that
third
party,
the
purpose
that
they
had
in
not
giving
him
employment.
we
don't
have
that
party
here
and
i
think
that
is
the
danger
of
this
type
of
testimony
so
far
as
the
respondents
are
concerned.
this
was
the
theory
upon
which
the
union
tried
the
case.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
first
of
all,
i
think
you're
assuming
something
that
is
--
is
not
accurate.
for
--
and
for
the
first
five
months
of
the
period
with
which
we're
concerned,
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
all.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
there
is
no
evidence
of
such
in
the
record
if
it
--
if
it
--
i
don
t
know
the
answer.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
in
the
record,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that.
nobody
was
concerned
with
that
at
the
time
you
see,
so
no
evidence
of
that
was
put
in.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
would
support
such
an
inference.
the
evidence
in
the
record
deals
with
how
a
member
of
the
union
obtained
employment.
it
does
not
deal
with
the
question
of
union
membership
as
a
prerequisite
for
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
--
employment.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that
--
that
as
a
member
of
the
union,
the
respondent
would
have
been
entitled
to
be
dispatched
from
the
hall.
other
people
who
were
not
members
of
the
union
were
also
dispatched
from
the
hall
and
other
people
obtained
their
employment
directly
from
the
employers.
now
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
that's
right.
they
--
some
of
those
then
presented
a
--
a
letter
to
the
union
for
union
clearance
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
but
there's
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
because
as
one
who
was
not
a
union
member,
he
was
not
entitled
to
demand
as
of
right,
dispatched
from
the
hiring
hall.
if
there
had
been
a
--
a
hiring
hall
set
up
by
agreement
with
the
employers,
he
could
have,
but
there's
no
evidence
if
there
was
any
such
thing
there.
his
only
right
to
be
dispatched
from
the
union
hall
was
--
as
a
member
of
the
union
and
his
membership
had
been
wrongly
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
--
i
wouldn't
agree
with
the
--
went
only
so
far
as
but
it
did
go.
it
didn't
mean
that.
it
also
meant
that
he
didn't
have
the
property,
his
--
his
interest
in
the
property
of
the
union
that
he
didn't
have
you
know.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
well,
there's
not
only
the
lost
wages
claim.
there
is
also
the
humiliation
matter
you
see
and
--
and
gonzales
was
a
--
was
a
member
of
the
executive
board.
he
was
a
member
of
the
policy
committee.
he
was
a
prominent
active
member
of
the
trade
union.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
and
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
there
was
no
agreement
with
the
employer
and
no
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
not
only
there
was
no
agreement
with
the
employer
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
whether
it
was
by
agreement
or
just
by
custom
that
this
was
the
only
way
to
obtain
employment.
in
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
say
absolutely
not.
that
if
you
make
a
careful
examination
of
this
record,
the
type
of
examination
that
the
board
says
it
must
make
in
situations
where
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
agreement,
for
example,
in
as
they've
said
in
the
salt
river
case
where
there's
no
--
where
there's
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
then
we
have
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
practices
of
the
parties,
they
say.
and
there,
although,
they
found
that
a
trade
union
representative,
a
business
agent
had
said
to
the
employer
that
what
the
--
the
activity
the
employee
was
engaged
in
that
the
employer
objected
to
was
not
the
policy
of
the
union
and
the
union
didn't
condone
it
and
the
union
was
going
to
take
disciplinary
action
against
a
man
who
did
this
circulating
a
petition
to
commence
an
action
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
even
though
the
union
went
so
far
as
to
do
that.
they
said
no,
the
board
said
no,
this
didn't
cause
the
employer
to
discriminate.
this
wasn't
a
cause
of
it.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
was
a
marine
machinist.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
it
might.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
--
it
did
work
that
way.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
if
they
had
them.
if
not,
they'd
send
other
men.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
even
--
even
if
they
weren't
able
to
show
an
order
with
union
man.
well,
i
should
say
that
the
record
does
not
really
deal
with
that.
there's
no
evidence
--
let's
put
it
this
way.
the
test
--
the
evidence
is
the
uncontradicted
evidence
is
really
that
he
was
unable
to
obtain
any
employment
after
his
expulsion,
so
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
they
wouldn't
dispatch
him.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
they
would
not
dispatch
him.
the
dispatcher
testified.
he
was
an
expelled
member.
he
couldn't
work.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
that's
right,
even
if
he
came
in
with
a
letter
from
an
employer.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
would
say
that
it
is
only
if
that
was
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
obtain
employment
because
if
--
if
i
operate
a
hiring
hall
and
i
send
men
out,
i
operate
it
like
an
employment
agency
and
i
send
men
out
to
employers
who
want
jobs.
and
if
you
come
around
and
ask
me
to
send
you
out
and
i
don't
do
it,
i
haven't
committed
any
unfair
labor
practice
unless
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
well
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
would
be
a
charge
cognizable
before
the
board
but
one
cannot
tell
from
this
record,
whether
or
not
there
was
actually
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
gonzales
went
to
the
board
and
filed
such
as
a
charge
and
they
told
him,
“you
go
get
a
lawyer.”
they
--
he
did
not
press
the
matter
any
further
before
the
board.
he
did
go
and
get
a
lawyer.
but
--
certainly,
it's
a
case
which
could
be
considered
by
the
board.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
don't
think
so
because
you
are
concerned
here
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
brennan
with
deciding
whether
the
state
court
has
lost
its
jurisdiction
or
is
without
jurisdiction.
the
state
court
had
to
determine
that
question.
it
had
two
ways
of
determining
it.
first,
by
looking
at
the
pleadings.
nothing
was
said
about
unfair
labor
practice
there,
except
that
it
was
claimed
that
equity
couldn't
give
any
relief
because
he
still
had
administrative
remedy.
and
then
it
could
look
at
the
--
at
the
evidence
and
the
evidence
didn't
deal
with
any
unfair
labor
practice.
that
is,
it
didn't
deal
with
causing
the
employer
to
discriminate
in
anyway.
there
wasn't
a
theory
of
the
union
at
the
trial
and
it
wasn't
the
theory
of
gonzales,
of
course,
at
the
trial.
so,
the
state
court
as
a
practical
matter
had
to
decide
whether
it
could
give
the
relief
which
this
litigant
before
it
was
requesting.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
would
put
it
differently.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
was.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
but
as
i
see
it,
this
court
does
not
have
to
decide.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
was
there
a
remedy
before
the
board?
this
court
has
to
decide,
should
the
state
court
have
declined
to
hear
this
matter?
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
even
if
there
was
a
remedy
before
the
board
because
this
--
and
--
and
when
you
look
at
what
the
state
court
felt
it
was
dealing
with,
you
find
that
the
state
court
to
seriously
consider.are
we
here
treading
on
the
toes
of
the
board?
no,
we're
not.
we're
not
concerned
with
the
same
thing.
we're
not
--
we
recognize
the
board's
jurisdiction.
if
the
--
if
the
pleadings
had
disclosed
an
unfair
labor
practice
question
here,
then
--
then
there's
no
doubt
about
what
the
california
court
would
do
under
the
rule
of
this
case.
it
would
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
it
was
raised
by
the
petitioners
here.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
in
the
appellate
court
--
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
--
after
the
briefs
had
been
filled,
a
file
of
supplemental
brief
raising
this
question
for
the
first
time.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
on
the
record
that
has
been
made
on
a
different
theory.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
exactly,
exactly.
now
i
have
one
other
thing
i
think
that
needs
to
be
said.
the
--
the
petitioners
here
in
their
reply
brief
discussed
very
briefly
a
question
which
they
reserved
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
whether
or
not
there
is
an
8
(b)
(1)
offense
here.
and
they
--
they
seem
to
me
to
use
the
--
the
method
of
dichotomy
when
they
should
have
used
the
method
of
trichotomy
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
that
is,
they
say
that
if
the
activity
was
not
condemned,
the
activity
in
which
they
engaged
and
which
was
the
cause
of
the
complaint
here.
if
that
was
not
condemned
by
the
act,
it
must
have
been
protected
by
the
act.
and
as
i
understand
it,
it's
well
settled
law
that
there
is
a
third
category
of
activity
which
is
neither
condemned
nor
protected.
and
that
this
activity,
that
is,
expulsion
of
union
members
seems
to
me
to
be
clearly
within
the
third
category
of
activity
which
is
neither
protected
nor
prohibited
and
from
which
the
federal
law
has
withdrawn
its
hands
entirely.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
expressly.
yes,
under
the
proviso.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
yes,
they
do.
i
think
they
do
this
pursuant
to
a
rule.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
oh,
i
think
that
what
it
--
what
it
means
to
the
--
to
--
to
people
who
are
concerned
with
this,
your
honor,
what
it
means
to
people
who
are
--
who
are
concerned
with
this
questions
is
that
when
a
man
who's
been
expelled
from
a
trade
union
seeks
a
state
remedy
for
that
and
the
trade
union
involved
does
not
in
its
answer
to
his
complaint
say,
“well,
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
this
is
a
matter
that
should
be
before
the
labor
board.”
when
it
doesn't
do
that
and
when
it
doesn't
put
in
any
evidence,
that
it's
that
kind
of
a
case
that
the
state
court
perforce
must
go
ahead
and
hear
the
litigant
who
has
come
to
it
for
aid
and
award
the
relief
to
which
he
establishes
his
right.
and
that
the
state
is
obligated
to
give
this
kind
of
--
of
relief
when
the
existence
of
a
federal
--
that
is
a
labor
board
question
is
not
raised.
mr.
lloyd
e.
mcmurray
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
record.
