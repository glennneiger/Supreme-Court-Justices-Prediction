mr.
plato
e.
papps
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
damages
awarded
to
one
marcos
gonzales
because
of
a
refusal
of
the
union
to
clear
him
for
work
after
his
expulsion
from
the
union.
he
based
his
theory
on
a
contract,
breach
of
contract
and
the
conduct
involved
was,
in
our
opinion,
conduct
which
is
reasonably
within
the
ambit
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
board.
the
question
is
whether
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
displaced
where
an
individual
is
refused
clearance
for
work
under
a
preferential
hiring
arrangement
after
he's
been
expelled
from
the
union
and
as
a
consequence
thereof,
separate
wage
loss
and
under
the
plaintiff's
theory
that
his
conduct
was
a
breach
of
contract.
i
think
the
facts
can
be
best
summarized
in
the
following
fashion.
marcos
gonzales
was
a
member
of
the
union
for
a
number
of
years
and
in
1952,
march
of
1952
was
expelled
from
the
union
under
an
internal
union
procedure,
that
is
he
was
expelled
because
he
failed
to
comply
with
the
penalty
imposed
by
the
international
president
and
was
subsequently
dropped
as
a
member.
at
the
time
he
was
dropped,
he,
for
12
years
prior
to
that
time,
had
been
referred
for
work
as
a
marine
machinist
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
and
i
suppose
the
oakland
area
as
well
through
a
hiring
hall
practice
in
which
the
union
would
refer
him
to
work
to
the
employer.
a
condition
--
one
of
the
conditions
imposed
was
membership
in
the
union
and
that
is
he
was
required
to
show
a
card
or
an
out
of
work
card
before
he
could
be
referred
for
work.
he
was
out
of
work
from
--
as
a
result
of
this
union
conduct
from
march
1952
until
june
of
1953
at
which
time
he
became
ill
and
incapacitated
and
in
the
meanwhile,
he
brought
an
action.
he
brought
an
action
in
the
state
court
in
which
he
sought
damages.
he
sought
an
order
restoring
him
into
union
membership
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
illegally
expelled
and
he
sought
damages
for
loss
of
earnings.
between
march
of
1952,
the
time
that
he
was
expelled
from
the
union,
and
december
when
he
filed
his
action,
december
of
1952,
he
also
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
these
charges
were
withdrawn
upon
advice
of
his
counsel
in
the
subsequent
action,
the
action
which
is
there
--
before
he
was
filed.
the
--
the
trial
commenced
and
in
--
in
february
of
1954,
some
13
months
later,
the
complaint
was
amended
to
--
to
include
punitive
damages
and
compensatory
damages
for
mental
distress
and
anguish.
after
trial,
there
was
a
--
an
award
for
loss
of
earnings
in
the
amount
of
$6800
for
actual
wage
loss
and
$2500
for
damages
for
mental
anguish
or
mental
distress.
the
chronology
thereafter
was
that
the
matter
was
taken
to
the
--
to
the
california
court
of
appeals.
and
in
the
first
decision,
i
might
add
part
two
that
in
the
original
answer
and
i
think
this
is
quite
important,
in
the
original
answer
to
the
complaint,
the
union,
the
respondent
raised
the
federal
question
when
it
alleged
that
the
--
that
the
marcos
gonzales
had
inadequate
remedy
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
8
(b)
(1)
and
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
anyway,
we
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
at
that
point
the
first
court
of
appeals'
decision
decided
that
this
matter
was
preempted
that
it
was
a
--
a
matter
that
the
court
could
not
control
it
and
dismissed
or
reversed
the
court
below
on
the
ground
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
on
rehearing,
the
court
has
reversed
itself
and
said
that
the
entire
theory
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
action
was
a
breach
of
contract
that
unfair
labor
practices
were
not
involved
and
then
relying
on
almost
the
identical
cases
it
had
previously
decided
in
the
first
instance
stated
that
in
each
of
these
cases,
real
v.
curran
and
born
versus
laube
that
--
that
in
those
cases,
the
issue
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
was
actually
raised
and
was
an
issue
at
the
trial
court.
he
said
however,
“that
was
not
raised
and
it
was
not
an
issue
here.”
it
ignored
the
fact
that
the
--
on
the
record,
the
testimony
showed
that
gonzales
had
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
ignored
the
fact
that
the
--
in
addition
to
that
--
and
also
that
the
answer
had
raised
the
--
the
unfair
labor
practice
issue,
the
federal
question
that
is
now
before
us.
we
contend
that
the
--
i
might
go
on
and
i
should
say
that
following
that,
we
took
an
appeal
to
file
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
hearing
was
denied.
subsequent
to
that
in
january
of
this
year,
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
in
and
it
was
granted
this
october
and
that's
how
this
case
is
before
this
court
in
this
posture.
we
contend
that
the
conduct
involved
here
that
is
the
failure
of
the
union
to
clear
marcos
gonzales
for
work
after
his
expulsion.
it's
a
common
unfair
labor
practice
that
i
--
i
don't
think
we
even
have
to
go
beyond
the
fact
that
it
is
an
8
(b)
(2)
and
the
courts
have
so
held,
the
board
has
so
held.
the
rather
reason
on
this
ground
is
that
it
need
not
even
being
said
that
the
conduct
is
necessarily
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
conduct
is
reasonably
within
the
ambit
of
either
protected
activity
under
section
7
of
the
act
or
within
the
proscriptions
of
section
8
of
the
act
then
the
conduct
is
still
within
the
exclusive
control
and
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
think
that
proposition
is
pointed
out
in
the
webber
case
which
spells
that
out
very
clearly.
we
additionally
urge
to
the
court
that
the
following
factors
do
not
displace
federal
preemption
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
action
was
based
on
a
breach
of
contract
rather
than
a
--
alleging
any
conduct
of
8
(b)
(2)
where
the
conduct
itself
is
reasonably
within
the
scope
of
--
of
8
(b)
(2)
or
8
(b)
(1)
or
any
other
such
illegal
conduct
in
the
section
8
or
where
a
mental
--
mental
distress
is
alleged
does
not
displace
the
exclusiveness
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
with
respect
to
a
common
unfair
labor
practice
or
where
the
question
involved
is
the
restoration
of
the
member
to
membership
and
the
damages
that
float
from
there.
if
congress
had
intended
that
this
type
of
conduct
was
within
the
ambit
and
control
of
the
state
under
the
proviso
of
the
section
8
(b)
(1)
that
is
where
it
can
control
restoration
to
a
membership
of
an
individual
because
the
proviso
to
8
(b)
(1)
indicates
a
clear
congressional
intent
that
it
did
not
wish
to
control
the
retention
or
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
prescribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership
therein
and
certainly
intended
that
--
that
should
be
left
open
to
the
states.
if
congress
had
intended
as
well
that
the
state
should
then
take
and
couple
with
that
right
that
is
the
restoration
to
membership
in
a
union,
any
loss
of
wages
that
may
afloat
from
the
discrimination
or
the
conduct
involved
as
a
result
of
the
expulsion
of
the
individual
from
the
union
and
it
certainly
could
have
enacted
a
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(2)
which
would
have
clearly
given
that
right
to
the
state.
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
that
once
the
state
restored
the
individual
membership
that
it
should
also
occupy
that
portion
of
the
federal
scheme
in
which
an
individual
can
be
restored
to
membership
and
may
call
under
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
indeed,
if
these
contract
remedies
to
anything
else,
they
show
that
the
--
that
they
impair
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
and
then
in
our
opinion
we
would
have
a
multiplicity
of
suits
wherever
there
is
8
(b)
(2)
conduct
because
the
individual
in
question
could
choose
his
form
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
go
to
the
labor
board
or
go
to
a
state
court
for
redress
under
this
area
of
alleged
conduct.
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
under
the
approach,
we
urge
here
that
is
that
the
state
can
regulate
the
membership
of
an
individual
in
the
union
that
that
is
left
to
it
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
the
conduct
involved
that
is
the
refusal
to
clear
or
to
redress
for
loss
of
wages
is
left
to
the
federal
scheme,
gives
both
of
the
federal
--
gives
both
the
federal
and
the
state
interest
or
proper
ordinance
without
conflict
keeps
them
in
their
proper
perspective
and
their
interest
are
preserved.
