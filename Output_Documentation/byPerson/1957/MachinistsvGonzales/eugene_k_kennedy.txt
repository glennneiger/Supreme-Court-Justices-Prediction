mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices,
if
i
may
perhaps
by
way
of
answer
to
mr.
mcmurray
summarize
perhaps
a
little
more
detailed
background
of
this,
i
think
it
might
focus
the
issues
more
sharply.
the
--
this
case
started
out
with
--
in
the
trial
court
with
mr.
mcmurray's
opening
statement
which
i
would
ask
the
court
liberty
to
read
which
commences
on
page
36
of
the
record.
referring
to
the
respondent,
gonzales,
mr.
mcmurray
or
counsel
states
as
the
marine
machinist
his
work
is
primarily
repair
work
on
vessels,
ocean-going
vessels
that
come
into
repair
yards
in
the
area.
as
a
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
page
36,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
--
of
the
--
of
the
transcript,
sir.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
and
that's
across
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
approximately
in
the
middle
of
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
--
the
page.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
and
for
--
and
that
i
will
--
if
i
may,
i'd
just
eliminate
that
paragraph
and
go
down
to
the
march
of
1952,
which
is
a
critical
date
in
this
case
where
he
was
no
longer
a
member
of
good
standing
in
the
union.
since
march
of
1952,
however,
the
plaintiff
has
been
unable
to
obtain
any
work
because
every
time
he
applies
for
a
job,
he
is
told
to
go
to
the
hall
to
get
a
clearance.
and
when
he
goes
to
the
local
lodge
hall,
he
is
told
that
no
clearance
can
be
given
until
he
pays
the
fine
and
apologizes
to
true
acts
and
is
reinstated
as
a
member.
therefore,
he
is
unable
--
he
has
been
unable
to
support
himself
by
his
earnings
from
march
of
1952
to
the
present
date.
the
evidence
deduced
at
the
trial
from
respondent
on
two
different
occasions,
i
might
say
although
i
--
i'm
--
this
--
these
--
this
case
was
tried
in
december
of
1952,
i
believe,
and
february
of
1954
for
reasons
that
aren't
pertinent
in
here.
but
in
any
event,
at
the
first
trial,
for
whatever
its
worth,
this
court
had
not
yet
decided
garner
and
i
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
at
the
trial
court
level
why
i
didn't
raise
garner
on
the
second
case,
i
had
no
excuse
for
this.
it
should
have
been
raised.
i
say
this
evidence
or
this
record
just
is
inundated
with
evidences
that
suggest
8
(b)
(2)
for
which
back-pay
by
the
--
in
the
form
of
lost
of
wages
is
given
as
a
remedy
by
the
labor
board.
and
if
i
may
categorize
in
the
record
which
is
before
you,
what
suggest
in
8
(b)
(2),
i
would
like
to
do
so
with
this
preliminary
statement.
i
don't
feel
that
it's
incumbent
on
petitioners
here
to
prove
that
we
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice.i
think
all
that
we
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
this
reasonably,
looks
like
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
the
congress
is
best
to
the
determination
of
that
in
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
i
think
that
the
radio
officers
case
which
this
court
has
decided,
the
holderby
case
which
is
uniquely
at
posit
here
which
i'm
going
to
discuss
where
a
man
sued
in
the
california
court
to
reinstatement
and
the
labor
board
gave
him
back-pay
under
8
(b)
(2)
where
there
was
no
contact
with
employers
at
all.
his
name
is
merely
removed
from
a
preferential
hiring
list.
the
actual
linking
of
a
union
action
with
a
specific
employer,
i
regard
as
settled
law
is
not
required
to
--
to
establish
8
(b)
(2).
i
may
even
go
this
much
further
as
an
--
as
an
abstraction.
if
you
have
discrimination,
it
can't
exist
in
a
vacuum.
you
can't
--
gonzales
doesn't
--
didn't
work
for
the
union.
he
worked
for
someone
else
and
if
--
it's
charge
that
the
union
caused
the
employer,
a
cause,
loss
of
wages
implicit
in
that
is
that
there
was
some
action
taken
with
the
respect
to
employers.
otherwise,
loss
of
wages
would
be
a
meaningless
term
as
--
as
i
view
the
thing.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
taken
with
his
testimony
that
--
that
is
the
way
that
he
received
work
for
the
prior
of
12
years
and
that
after
that
he
was
unable
to
receive
work,
taken
with
--
with
that
in
addition.
now,
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
to
the
petition
if
you
please
that
initiated
this
action
on
page
6
of
the
record.
there's
an
--
an
allegation
in
there
in
paragraph
xv,
from
and
after
march
15,
1952,
your
petitioner
has
been
unable
to
secure
employment
in
his
former
occupation
solely
by
reason
as
the
illegal,
wrongful
and
improper
expulsion
and
punishment
of
your
petitioner
by
respondent
associations.
in
this
context,
it
appears
to
me
that
that
is
reciting
8
(b)
(2).
it
looked
like
8
(b)
(2)
to
me
because
as
i
recall
insofar
as
you
can
go
back,
i
alleged
that
he
had
a
remedy
under
that
and
i
would
direct,
of
course,
to
--
to
this
which
counsel
did
neglect
to
this
day.
on
page
67
of
the
printed
record,
counsel
who
is
now
arguing
that
there's
no
suggestion
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
record
who
received
testimony
from
the
respondent,
gonzales,
that
he
advised
him
to
go
to
the
labor
board
in
the
first
place
so
that
it
--
it
must
have
looked
like
something
for
the
labor
board
determination
to
mr.
mcmurray
contrary
to
the
suggestion
that
this
was
and
something
purely
for
state
action.
now,
to
take
--
if
i
may
just
list
what
i
think
show
that
there's
the
very
extremely
strong
suggestion
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
this
case.
we'll
start
with
the
fact
that
respondent,
the
advice
of
counsel
filed
unfair
labor
practices
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
his
petition
which
i've
just
read
the
--
on
analysis
i
believe,
you'll
conclude
that
that
suggest
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(2)
for
the
reason
that
loss
of
wages
have
to
occur
with
relation
to
possible
employment.
and
certainly,
that
it
--
no
one
contends
that
gonzales
worked
for
the
union.
third,
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
--
and
the
conclusions
of
the
law,
the
trial
court
recite
in
affect
what's
recited
here
in
the
petition,
the
causing
of
the
loss
of
wages
by
the
union.
the
evidence
in
this
case
which
is
detailed
from
mr.
gonzales
and
from
the
union
the
statute
is
abundantly
clear
that
because
gonzales
was
not
in
good
standing
in
the
union,
he
was
not
to
be
referred
until
he
was.
the
next
thing
that
i
--
i
think
that
is
properly
before
the
court
for
--
is
the
first
decision
of
the
california
district
court
of
appeals
which
appeal
--
which
appears
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
in
fact,
i
think
it
would
represent
a
brief
for
the
petitioners
here.
it
states
rather
equivalently
that
this
is
language
preempted
for
the
labor
board.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
certainly.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
now
--
there
is
a
contract
with
respect
to
union
membership.
the
constitution
is
--
and
i
raise
this
in
arguing
it
on
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
question.
the
union
is
bound
as
mr.
gonzales
is
found
to
follow
the
terms
that
the
constitution
in
their
relations
between
themselves,
i
agree
with
that,
sir.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
not
at
all.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
well,
that
existed
--
that's
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
excuse
me,
i
didn't
understand
it.
i
should
say
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
i
--
i
think
i
can
answer
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
yes.
and
i
--
i
believe
that
we
can.
and
this
is
--
this
is
the
way
i
would
like
to
start.
in
this
case,
we
have
chronologically
two
separate
acts.
we
have
expulsion
from
union
and
the
next
thing
that
follows
that
which
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
follow
is
discrimination
in
employment.
now,
i
say
that
if
a
trial
court
found
that
the
discrimination
and
under
its
procedure
are
--
i
beg
your
--
if
i
may
withdraw
that
that
the
expulsion
in
and
out
itself
gave
rise
to
damages.
we
are
not
contesting
that
the
state
court
on
the
pure
active
expulsion
alone
under
its
own
rules
could
or
could
not
allow
damages
but
i
do
emphatically
want
to
emphasize
this.
we're
dealing
here
with
something
that
the
--
was
created
in
1947
discrimination
by
a
union
in
--
in
section
8
(b)
(2),
discrimination
by
a
union
may
follow
rightful
or
wrongful
discharge.
this
is
activity
which
i
believe
it
can
be
very
well
exemplified
in
this
holderby
case
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief
and
under
that
name,
the
california
court
and
the
international
operating
engineers
in
the
labor
board.
now,
what
happened
there,
holderby
sued
in
the
california
court
to
get
reinstated
in
the
union
and
he
brought
an
action
of
8
(b)
(2)
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
--
because
of
discrimination
on
the
theory
purely
that
his
name
was
removed
from
the
preferential
hiring
list.
and
if
we
want
--
and
our
ultimate
aim
here
i
suspect
is
to
find
out
what
congress
intended.
in
addition
to
the
cases
which
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
he
lost
in
the
state
court
because
he
had
not
exhausted
remedies,
mr.
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
under
the
union
procedure.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
no.
we
have
no
question
here
except
the
question
of
discrimination
as
i
--
as
we
see
it.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
as
i
see
it,
those
rights
still
come
before
the
labor
board,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
my
own
view
and
i
of
necessity
if
my
colleagues
and
i
have
considered
this
and
talked
about
it
at
some
length
is
that
the
more
you
look
at
this
particular
problem,
you
will
see
that
discrimination
is
a
--
a
new
federally
created
substance
of
right
and
that
there's
a
remedy
given
for
it.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1947
amendments
where
there
was
no
provision
for
discrimination
in
unions,
in
many
states,
they
would
give,
and
i
think
that
was
recognized
perhaps,
most
succinctly
in
real
against
curran
where
they
said
apart
from
federal
legislation,
this
long
had
been
the
rule
in
our
state
that
we
will
not
only
restore
a
member
but
give
him
back
or
back
wages.
real
again
curran
and
the
mahoney
case
which
is
in
the
washington
supreme
court
and
sterling
which
all
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
in
mcnish
against
american
brass
i
believe
cut
the
line
between
the
question
of
internal
union
membership
and
between
the
question
of
something
else
that
happens
afterwards,
namely,
does
the
union
by
its
action
or
non-
action
with
respect
to
a
member
actually
cause
him
to
loss
employment?
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
last
section
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
award
of
damages
in
the
gonzales
case,
the
california
court
in
detail
spells
out
the
practice
of
the
hiring
hall
and
the
fact
that
this
lack
of
the
utilization
of
the
hiring
hall
is
what
caused
this
loss
of
wages.
now,
with
respect
to
this
question
of
contract,
i'm
not
going
to
quarrel
now
with
this
characterization
put
on
the
state
court
as
to
record,
with
respect
to
the
record.
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
its
--
as
far
as
i
know
by
name
in
any
event
on
the
act
in
the
--
on
the
occasion
for
rehearing
after
it
had
recognized
that
the
activity
constituted
this
discriminatory
type
of
activity.
if
the
state
can
take
over
areas
of
discrimination
on
every
occasion
where
a
man
is
ousted
from
a
union,
i
suggest
that
8
(b)
(2)
is
a
nugatory
thing
because
any
union
member
where
he
is
ousted
from
the
union
can
choose
his
form
by
saying
this
is
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
well,
i'll
--
i'll
try
to
answer
better
this
time
and
i'll
--
i
will
concede,
i'll
choose
as
many
times
on
these
things.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
as
i
see
it,
the
contract
that
was
an
issue
here
was
whether
or
not
he
had
a
right
to
a
fair
trial.
the
--
there
are
--
i
--
as
far
as
i
know
the
record
is
barren,
completely
barren
of
any
contractual
arrangements
with
reference
to
this
hiring
hall.
it
was
a
procedure
that'd
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
if
you
want
to
call
it
approximate
cause
from
a
breach
of
contract,
i
won't
quarrel
with
it.
i
think
it's
a
plausible
theory
that
they
--
was
utilized.
but
i
do
say
that
as
in
weber
and
several
of
these
other
cases
where
restraint
of
trade
or
states
acted
in
the
name
of
labor
relations
statutes
were
used
in
the
state
courts
as
their
theory
for
action
that
was
recognized
by
this
court
that
it
was
immaterial,
what
label
you
put
on
it.
the
--
the
important
thing
is
what
type
of
conduct
is
being
regulated.
if
the
state
called
it
a
breach
of
contract,
a
tort,
a
conspiracy,
to
me
it
would
seem
to
be
immaterial
as
long
they
are
actually
regulating
something
that
congress
had
said
is
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
regulate
namely
discrimination
in
employment
caused
by
unions.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
with
respect
to
his
union
membership,
yes.
and
i
think
the
statute
--
or
the
statute
that
we're
concerned
with
here
perhaps
makes
this
the
most
strongest
type
of
the
case
for
federal
preemption
if
i
may
elaborate
on
that
for
no
one.
the
other
statutes
go
under
the
general
policy
that
as
you've
held
in
guss
photo
that
10
(a)
means
what
it
says
that
the
labor
board
is
the
exclusive
for
it.
discrimination
in
employment
has
an
added
factor
within
the
statute
itself
which
suggests
that
it
must
be
a
federally
preempted.
and
that
is
that
at
the
same
time
that
congress
was
saying
to
the
unions,
“you
take
care
of
the
intra-union
affairs
immediately
following
it.”
it
enacted
the
8
(b)
(2)
covering
discrimination
by
unions
which
suggests
as
coincidence
of
time
that
if
the
congress
thought
that
control
over
a
question
of
membership
would
drag
with
it
and
into
the
state
courts
control
over
the
aspect
of
discrimination
that
would
have
been
perhaps
the
most
appropriate
and
--
and
suggested
time
that
you
can
imagine
it
could
have
said
so
but
it
didn't.
and
discrimination
in
--
is
a
common
unfair
labor
practice,
discrimination,
its
coupled
with
two
--
its
coupled
in
this
case
with
the
question
of
union
membership
which
is
not
an
issue.we
think
there
are
two
separate
acts.
discrimination
may
or
may
not
follow
expulsion
from
union
membership,
for
example,
a
weak
union
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
i
would
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
no,
i
would
say
i'd
leave
to
the
states
all
the
contractual
elements
of
the
constitution
between
the
member
and
the
union
with
respect
to
membership.
when
you
have
discrimination,
a
separate
act,
chronologically,
need
not
be
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
the
same
package.
and
in
fact,
here
it
wasn't
in
the
same
package.
he
was
separated
on
one
day
and
in
retrospect,
no
one
knows
whether
that
separation
would
or
would
not
have
caused
his
unemployment.
the
california
court
found
that
that
did.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
i
beg
your
pardon
for
discrimination.
there
is
the
hines
case.
it's
a
federal
circuit
case
which
i
can't
cite
to
you.
but
there
is
a
case
where
a
man
in
this
situation
was
assessed
damages
because
he
was
expelled
from
the
union.
what
i'm
saying
is
the
state
can't
take
over
the
national
labor
relations
board
remedy.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
and
that
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
i
--
i
perhaps
had
been
over
contentious
and
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
i
may
--
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
one
other
thing.
in
the
california
court's
decision,
you
will
find
that
it
recognizes
that
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
--
it
says
there's
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
it
says
it
wasn't
treated
or
charged
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
despite
this
chronology
i've
given
you
into
the
background.
and
therefore,
as
distinguished
from
mahoney
and
real
against
curran
and
some
of
these
other
cases
with
parallel
issues,
we
can
--
we're
permitted
to
regard
as
a
breach
of
contract.
so
that
a
sustaining
of
the
california
court's
decision
would
say
that
you
can
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
recognized
by
a
state
court
but
if
the
state
court
wants
to,
it
can
also
apply
another
remedy
and
give
its
own
local
remedy.
and
the
questions
of
diversity
and
the
variety
of
state
actions,
it
could
be
instituted
under
the
guise
of
bringing
in
any
local
segment.
if
the
local
segment
of
the
controversy
would
bring
in
anything
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
board,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
frustrate
many
of
the
things
that
i've
read
about
that
--
which
this
court
has
stated
recently.
and
perhaps
the
last
thing
that
i
need
to
say
on
--
i'm
somewhat
in
doubt
about
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
questions.
still
i
--
i
don't
fully
--
i
--
i
think
that
perhaps
our
line
of
cleavages
that
in
the
--
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
this
man
can
get
his
remedies
of
back-pay
and
lost
wages.
he
can
get
injunctive
relief.
he
can
get
all
the
relief
that
congress
intended
in
discrimination
and
i
--
i
don't
believe
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
cases
that
we
have
cited,
in
fact,
we
haven't
seen
any
to
the
contrary,
will
suggest
that
the
question
of
internal
union
membership
at
--
which
we
will
call
a
breach
of
contract,
brings
out
of
the
province
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
its
control
over
discrimination.
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
my
--
my
immediate
reaction
is
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible
but
i
invite
--
mr.
eugene
k.
kennedy
but
i
invite
--
invite
this
court
to
just
read
this
last
paragraph
of
the
court's
decision
where
it
states
and
makes
its
findings
why
it's
giving
the
wages.
it's
giving
it
because
it's
something
that
the
labor
board
would
give
for
discrimination,
the
findings
of
the
court.
thank
you.
