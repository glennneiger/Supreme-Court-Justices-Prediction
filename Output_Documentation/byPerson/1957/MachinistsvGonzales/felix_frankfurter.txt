justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
again
what
the
--
the
record
make
on
ambiguously
clear
for
what
the
damages
were
awarded?
what
was
the
basis
and
i
mean
the
legal
basis
or
to
what
loss
the
damages
--
were
the
damages
directed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
that's
an
--
if
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
if
that
had
been
committed
by
an
employer,
there
would
be
money
relief
for
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
is
not
--
this
is
at
the
union.
this
is
going
against
the
union
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
raises
the
question
we've
canvassed
in
the
area
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
secondly,
you
indicate
one
interest
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
raises
the
question
if
the
first
would
be
decided
against,
namely,
that
the
board
can
give
relief
then
that
question
--
the
second
question
that
the
court
has
to
take
is
whether
that
exhausts
all
remedies,
either
in
state,
either
before
the
board
or
before
the
state
clause,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
may
i
--
without
studying
it
too
much,
ask
whether
if
the
action
of
the
board
through
expulsion,
resulted
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
leading
the
employer
to
discriminate
against
him
and
not
hiring
him,
wouldn't
the
board
also
have
power
to
require
that
the
board
restore
him
in
membership
--
to
membership?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
--
assuming
what
the
union
did
could
be
found
or
would
be
found,
could
be
but
was
potentially
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
was
affect
upon
the
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
not
the
board
require
reinstatement
also
into
the
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
because
you
say
there's
no
power
under
the
act
for
the
board
to
determine
whether
he
was
lawfully
expelled,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
they
could
--
but
wouldn't
that
determination
be
inevitably
involved
in
holding
that
he
had
no
business
to
be
discharged
by
the
employer
provided
--
wouldn't
that
depend,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
wouldn't
that
depend
on
what
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
--
and
the
employer
is?
if
the
employer
made
--
if
there
is
a
collective
agreement,
that
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
person
must
be
referred
and
he
must
be
a
member
of
the
union
to
be
referred
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
union
improperly
expels
an
employee
and
thereby
the
employer
innocently
accuse
himself
relief
or
he
isn't
relieved
of
giving
him
--
or
letting
him
stay
on
the
job.
you
tell
me.
i'm
not
questioning
it.
i
want
information.
you
tell
me
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
board
can
only
compel
his
reinstatement
on
the
job,
but
it
couldn't
say,
“in
order
that
you
may
be
on
the
job,
you
must
be
in
the
union
and
therefore
we
order
you
to
be
in
the
union.”
he
couldn't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
is
that
--
does
that
come
up?
is
that
question
settled
or
are
you
just
arguing
this
on
principle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
take
care
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
have
--
i
guess
i
must
have
been
confused.
considering
that
the
petition
--
that
the
rehearing
was
granted
to
where
the
explicit
reference
to
a
consideration
of
taft-hartley,
why
that
--
why
didn't
that
inject
the
federal
problem
in
all
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
plenty
to
rush.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
could
it
help
being
if
the
court
asked
you
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
applicability,
if
any,
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
the
issue
of
damages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
from
which
i
draw
the
conclusion
that
if
the
district
court
of
appeals
had
chosen,
they
could
have
said,
“this
is
not
an
issue
before
us
because
it
wasn't
tried,”
but
that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
did
it?
in
other
words,
the
purposes
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
even
if
the
case
has
gone
through
three
courts
without
raising
a
federal
question
and
the
highest
court
of
the
state
on
a
rehearing
considered
it.
it's
indicated
for
our
purpose,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
isn't
this
not
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
that's
not
for
us.
if
the
court
of
--
if
the
california
court
or
a
michigan
court
or
any
court
at
any
state,
nisi
prius
or
appellate
deals
with
an
issue
involving
a
federal
question,
that's
enough
for
all
purposes.
and
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
internal
distribution
of
jurisdiction
among
california
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
what
--
what
is
conveyed
by
your
remark.
the
federal
question
wasn't
raised
and
that's
what
i'm
really
at.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
raised
in
the
judgment?
is
it
hard?
is
it
infused
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
a
part
of
the
judgment
now
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
although
the
court
of
appeals
did
consider
these
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
review
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
this
court
review
the
question
you've
just
stated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
is
there
that
we
cannot
review
in
your
--
what
is
not
open
here
for
a
consideration
which
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
hope
you
don't
assume
a
thing
like
that
unless
the
record
justifies
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
we
better
--
are
you
suggesting
that
from
your
point
of
view,
the
court
better
raise
in
the
record
plainly
shows
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
not
assumes
it
as
you
contend,
hypothetically,
in
order
to
decide
an
abstract
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
that
isn't
in
the
case,
why
should
--
why
should
it
be
assumed?why
do
you
suggest
to
the
court
it
might
assume
it?
why
don't
you
argue?
i'm
not
suggesting
what
you
should
argue.
i'm
trying
to
elicit
some
light.
why
do
you
not
stand
the
path,
if
i
may
use
an
algorithm
and
say,
“the
record
is
devoid
of
judicial
establishment
that
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
therefore
the
question
doesn't
arise
before
your
honors?”
what
is
it
that
prevents
you
from
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
establish
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
record
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
in
fact
this
was
operating
what
mr.
justice
brandeis
is
calling
and
it
is
about
preferential
shop
that
in
fact
they
prefer
union
people?
can
we
take
judicial
notice
on
this
record
that
--
that
the
practical
consequences
are
that
the
employer
wouldn't
hire
somebody
who
wasn't
referred
by
the
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
state
court
raised
that
question
you've
just
stated
we're
treading
on
federal
law,
sua
sponte
of
its
own
accord
or
how
is
that
--
how
did
the
state
who
have
come
to
raise
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
--
on
the
record
that
was
made
up,
up
to
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
you
mean
they
imposed
on
--
on
a
different
theory.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
was
before
them,
the
same
that
is
now
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difficulty
i
have
with
--
with
part
of
your
argument
is
that,
if
your
court,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
stopped
on
page
127
of
its
opinion
thus
the
question
of
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
raised
nor
was
any
finding
on
the
subject
requested
of
or
made
by
the
court
and
that
going
on
saying
therefore,
we
may
consider
it.
it
would
have
had
one
situation.
but
then
they
go
on,
that
is
the
way
of
court
and
talk
of
the
pages
about
something
they
say
isn't
before
of
them,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
care
why
they
do
it.
i
mean
what
if
it
wasn't.
what
is
significance
is
what
it
means
for
us
and
what
is
my
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
on
the
record,
i'd
have
easier
time
with
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kennedy
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
conceded
--
do
you
agree
that
the
arrangement
between
--
between
a
member
of
the
machinist
and
the
machinist
is
a
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
you're
going
to
is
--
if
the
court,
if
the
union,
if
a
union
disregards
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
union
and
expels
a
member
may
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction
get
mandatory
relief
as
this
person
to
did
here.
you're
not
here
challenging
the
man
that
the
--
the
decision
of
the
california
court
requiring
his
reinstatement
of
the
member,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
so
that
--
that
there
is
a
basis
for
specific
performance
of
the
contract
between
the
union
and
its
members,
is
that
right?
isn't
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
i'm
wrong
in
my
understanding
that
a
union
members
improperly
expelled
by
violation
of
the
agreement
between
him
and
the
union,
he
can
go
to
a
court
of
law
and
get
a
remedy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
if
in
fact
through
out
that
expulsion,
he
has
suffered
damages,
what
is
there
in
the
taft-hartley
act
that
says
that
that
cause
of
action
under
that
contract
is
no
longer
pursuable
a
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
answer
in
order
to
win
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
not
here,
is
it?
we're
not
bothering
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is
whether
a
plaintiff
who
has
rights
under
a
contract
involving
situations
which
may
come
before
the
labor
board
on
the
taft-hartley
act
loses
his
contract
right,
because
of
a
chance
apart
from
the
contract,
he
have
a
right
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
that's
the
question
as
i
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
true,
but
let
me
put
this
to
you.
suppose
--
suppose
in
this
kind
of
a
labor
agreement,
either
question
as
you
know
that
bothers
not
only
our
courts
but
if
you'd
like
to
follow
the
english
courts,
the
whole
relation
between
a
member
of
a
union
and
a
union,
the
basis
of
recovery,
a
very
complicated
question.
i
don't
think
we
get
very
far.
we
don't
realize
how
complicated
they
are.
suppose
in
a
union
contract
like
this,
there's
a
provision,
in
case
of
illegal
--
in
case
of
an
expulsion
in
this
regard
are
the
requirements
of
this
union
agreement
or
the
bylaws
of
the
union.
the
recovery
should
be
limited
to
a
liquidated
amount
to
wit,
a
thousand
dollars
or
x
dollars
in
view
of
the
difficulty
of
ascertaining
down
with
this.
will
that
be
impossible
in
the
state
court
or
would
you
have
to
first
consider
where
it
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice?
and
if
it
does
then
the
liquidated
damage
clause
evaporates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
mr.
kennedy,
may
i
suggest
that
that's
a
--
a
different
question
again
and
that
as
i
see
it
is
a
state
law
of
question
namely
what
the
consequences
are
of
a
breach
of
contract.
what
i'm
putting
to
you
is
that
your
court
rests
on
the
proposition
as
i
understand
it.
that
here
was
a
contract
relation
between
the
union
and
gonzales,
the
union
breached
its
contract.
he
seeks
relief.
he
seeks
specific
performance
toward
reinstatement
in
the
union.
and
secondly,
because
of
their
default,
because
of
their
breach
of
contract,
he
has
suffered
monetary
damages.
now,
whether
the
--
a
damages
are
established,
whether
there
is
a
cause
in
connection,
that's
not
a
federal
question.
that's
a
question
of
state
contract
law,
state
damage
law.
and
i
don't
think
that's
reviewable
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
a
--
a
litigant,
person
established
a
claim
by
merely
making
it,
a
court
has
to
adjudicate
it.
and
i'm
--
my
question
and
my
problem
is
assuming
its
unassailable
that
the
arrangement
between
gonzales
and
his
union
was
a
contract,
assuming
that
there
was
a
breach
of
that
contract
may
sue
in
the
state
court,
not
only
to
get
specific
performance
by
reinstatement
but
may
get
what
a
person
usually
gets
if
he
can
prove
it,
the
loss
that
he
suffered
because
a
promiser
didn't
keep
his
promise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they're
very
difficult
questions
i
can
assure
for
me
as
--
at
least
as
much
as
for
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
--
isn't
the
hiring
hall
a
sequence
of
being
a
member
in
good
standing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
first
question
to
you
and
everything
flows
to
that,
as
far
i'm
concerned
is
whether
you'll
contest
the
determination
by
the
california
court
giving
him
specific
performance
of
his
right
to
be
reinstated
in
the
union
because
he
was
improperly
fired
from
the
union.
now,
that
right
can
only
flow
because
he
had
a
contractual
relation
with
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
stop
you
right
there.
but
you
think
the
two
are
inextricably
related.
you
--
you
think
because
sometimes
because
of
discrimination,
is
not
a
contingency
of
--
of
expulsion.
there
may
be
discrimination
without
any
interference
which
his
contractual
relations.
therefore,
when
there
is
an
interference
with
his
contractual
relations
the
state
is
the
--
the
contractual
element
evaporates
from
all
state
control
that
it's
entirely
a
question
of
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position
in
effect,
isn't
it?
you
say
when
you
got
discrimination
you
look
at
nothing
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
california
case,
the
california
court
may
have
been
wrong.
as
a
matter
of
california
contract
law
or
damage
law.
but
if
the
california
court
found
that
he
was
improperly
expelled
that
the
contract
relation
was
violated
and
therefore,
he
has
the
right
to
specific
performance,
you
say
the
taft-hartley
act
precludes
the
chancellor
from
all
source
as
in
damages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
here,
we've
been
spending
nearly
four
hours
today
or
nearly
that
just
in
order
to
determine
when
it
does
and
when
it
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
you
haven't
been
at
all.
these
are
extremely
as
our
opinion
show,
either
extremely
difficult,
unsettled
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you're
good
enough
to
refer
--
to
turn
to
the
question,
i
--
my
hypothetical
case
about
liquidated
damages
really
tested
me,
namely,
whether
a
provision
in
the
union
agreement
in
case
of
illegal
expulsion
providing
for
remedy
of
liquidated
damages,
although
there
may
be
--
if
there
were
no
such
agreement
independently,
the
case
of
unfair
labor
practice
against
the
union
whether
that
makes
unenforceable
the
liquidated
damage
provision
within
--
within
--
in
the
labor
agreement,
in
the
union
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be.
do
you
think
that
would
be?
