it

mr.
william
garth
symmers
william
symmers
appearing
for
the
petitioner,
the
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
third-party
action
by
a
longshoreman
who
recovered
damages
from
the
petitioner,
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company,
for
personal
injuries
which
the
longshoreman
sustained
while
working
on
weyerhaeuser
ship
in
boston
harbor.
that
issue
here
is
the
right
of
the
shipowner
to
indemnity
from
contracting
stevedore
which
employed
the
injured
longshoreman
which
supervised
him
in
the
course
of
his
work.
the
logbook
for
the
day
in
which
this
longshoreman
was
injured
is
so
succinct
in
the
statement
of
facts.
before
i
go
into
my
narrative
of
facts,
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
simply
read
the
sailor's
language
of
how
it
happened.
mr.
william
garth

the
record

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
by
a
divided
court
affirms
the
trial
judges'
direction
of
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
third-party
defendant,
stevedoring
contractor,
in
the
shipowner's
action
to
recover
indemnity
from
the
stevedore.
the
trial
was
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
before
judge
mcgohey
and
the
jury.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
yes.
the
original
plaintiff
connolly
was
paid
after
indictment
in
his
favor
against
the
shipowner.
the
trial
judge
then
directed
judgment
in
favor
of
the
third-party
defendant
not
leaving
the
question
to
the
jury
at
all
and
between
the
--
the
original
shipowner
defendant
in
the
--
and
the
stevedore.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
well,
it's
not
a
question
of
primary
liability,
sir.
we
--
there
are
two
issues
submitted
to
the
court,
one
tried
together.
one
was
connolly
(voice
overlap)
a
claim
against
the
shipowner.
secondly,
was
the
shipowner's
claim
in
a
third-party
proceeding
against
the
stevedore.
the
judge
let
--
he
said
that
he
would
charge
the
jury
on
both
of
those
cases.
he
submitted
the
case
of
connolly,
the
longshoreman
against
the
shipowner
first
and
entered
instruction.
he
said,
"if
you
decide
against
the
shipowner
in
this
case
i
will
then
instruct
you
later
in
the
case
of
the
shipowner
for
indemnity
against
the
long
--
stevedoring
company."
the
longshoreman
reported.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
he
didn't
do
that.
he
entered
directed
verdict.
as
soon
as
the
jury
came
in
on
one
count
against
the
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
in
the
case
of
the
longshoreman
against
the
steamship
company
on
account
of
negligence
against
the
shipowner,
he
directed
a
verdict
immediately
in
the
second
case
in
favor
of
the
third-party
defendant
stevedore.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
only
with
the
fact
to
the
jury,
certainly.
that's
our
--
our
contention.
it
--
it
could
have
been
a
fact.
we
say
two
things.
our
point
here
is
that
actually
the
trial
court
heard
and
not
following
a
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
line
of
stevedoring
case
and
in
directing
the
--
in
the
second
--
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
they
showed
a
directed
verdict
for
the
shipowner
against
the
stevedore.
and
at
the
very
least,
they
should
have
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury
for
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
stevedore's
breach
of
contract
with
the
shipowner
was
the
approximate
cause
or
the
cause
of
the
agent
stevedore
--
any
longshoreman
is
injured.
i
think
it's
--
it
gets
rather
complicating
to
have
these
four
cases
or
four
parties
involved.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
the
jury
--
there
were
two
counts
in
connolly's
claim.
one
was
negligence,
a
failure
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
secondly,
unseaworthiness
causing
his
injury.
the
jury
found
for
the
shipowner
on
the
seaworthiness
count.
in
other
words,
they
found
the
ship
and
our
impertinent
that
we're
a
bit
seaworthy,
but
they
said,
"you
left
this
man
work
under
unsafe
conditions
and
therefore
you're
liable."
didn't
say
primarily
or
secondarily
or
anything
like
that.
that
was
submitted.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
yes,
sir.
well,
the
shipowner
has
a
non-delegable
duty
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
--
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work
even
if
that
place
has
been
created
unsafe
by
one
of
his
independent
contractors.
and
the
--
that
question
is
then,
where
--
this
liability
has
been
imposed
upon
us
with
no
fault
other
than
a
(inaudible)
for
committing
an
unsafe
condition.
we
are
not
therefore
entitled
to
go
up
against
the
independent
contractor
under
his
contract
for
contractual
indemnity
to
recover
the
damages
that
he
has
caused
(inaudible)
to
suffer.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
that
would
be
the
absolute
liability
(inaudible).
i
think
its
very
--
very
important
because
it
shows
the
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
under
the
law
as
presently
stated
by
this
court
in
ryan,
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
contract
itself
provides
this.
it's
in
the
record
at
page
65
that
the
stevedore
agrees
to
faithfully
furnish
such
stevedoring
services
as
maybe
required
upon
such
of
weyerhaeuser
vessels
as
are
assigned
to
the
contractor.
and
the
stevedore
further
agrees
to
provide
all
necessary
stevedoring
labor,
also
foreman
and
such
other
stevedoring
supervision
as
are
needed
for
the
proper
and
efficient
conduct
of
their
work.
now,
this
man
had
been
working
on
in
the
weyerhaeuser
ship.
there
are
no
--
the
stevedores
in
port,
all
the
11
deck
men
were
shore
--
on
shore
leave,
30
some
odd
longshoreman
taking
over
the
ship
discharging
under
a
--
a
specialized
long
work
under
their
own
foreman.
they
had
control
of
their
particular
portion
of
the
ship
for
four
days.
they
were
using
a
--
a
winch
shelter
to
keep
the
rain
off
the
winch
driver's
head
and
winds
and
so
forth.
there
had
been
a
record
by
this
very
stevedoring
company.
they
had
never
bothered
to
look
at
it
or
check
it
to
see
whether
this
flimsy
structure
which
was
built
from
dunnage
and
loose
pieces
of
wood
they
found
and
about,
was
safe
or
unsafe
to
the
vibration
of
the
ship
during
the
cargo
operation
with
the
wind
and
everything
else
for
the
last
four
days.
and
suddenly
a
piece
of
wood
falls
off
of
the
roof
of
this
shelter,
seven
feet
high
shelter
and
lands
down
the
lower
hold
on
top
of
mr.
connolly's
head.
the
jury
thought
that
was
a
worth
--
and
it
was
worth
$50,000
which
we
paid.
we
say
that
primary
duty
there
is
to
indemnify
us
is
rather
the
stevedoring
contractor
which
created
this
petition
which
would
--
we
hired
to
do
this
work.
they
built
their
shelter.
they
provided
their
own
supervisory
personnel
and
that
they
breached
their
contractual
obligation
to
do
their
work
properly.
and
that
we
therefore,
what
we
should've
done
is
we
moved
for
a
directed
verdict
in
our
favor.
and
at
the
very
least
that
the
case
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
the
--
any
conduct
on
the
part
of
nacirema
amounted
to
a
breach
of
contract
on
their
part
so
as
to
entitle
us
to
indemnity.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
well,
it's
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
say
any
jury
issue
but
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
well,
i
think
that
the
jury
covered
that
and
i
tried
to
cover
it
in
our
brief.
the
jury
would
be
entitled
on
--
if
we
--
if
the
ryan
case
is
still
the
law,
that
was
--
decided
here
in
1955,
the
jury
would
--
might
have
a
case
as
to
--
as
to
whether
this
particular
certain
type
of
this
case
were
caused
by
a
breach
of
contract
on
the
part
of
weyerhaeuser
to
that
effect.
now,
if
ryan
is
not
the
law
then
the
second
circuit
has
a
different
theory
of
the
law
which
they've
been
following
for
many
years
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
other
courts
too,
which
i
thought
had
been
put
to
sleep
by
ryan.
and
that
is
a
theory
of
active
primary
negligence
as
against
the
passive
negligence
and
the
party
who
is
guilty
of
the
--
what
the
court
used
to
call
so
active
or
primary
negligence
to
entitle
the
indemnity
or
rather
must
indemnify
the
negligence
to
the
owner
of
the
premises
who's
only
negligence
was
passive
and
that
he
submitted
the
conditions
to
exist.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
not
by
me.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
no,
i
think
the
other
side
attempts
to
distinguish
it.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
and
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
below,
two
of
the
judges,
judge
terry
waterman
writing
his
opinion
joined
by
judge
medina
were
of
the
view
that
while
the
facts
of
our
case
are
strikingly
similar
to
the
ryan
case,
nevertheless
it's
distinguishable.
well,
it
is
distinguishable
as
all
cases
are
distinguishable
and
that
the
trouble
is
that
the
--
in
fact,
it's
so
close
that
one
is
a
little
bit
blinded
about
the
principles
of
law,
i
think,
it
applied.
now,
judge
lombard
said,
"not
only
does
ryan
apply
but
it's
a
--
it
applies
despite
the
distinction
made
by
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals."
in
--
in
the
ryan
case,
the
stevedore
loaded
some
paper
down
in
george
town,
south
carolina
negligently
and
then
the
same
stevedore
discharged
the
ship
in
new
york
and
one
of
the
employees
was
hurt
as
a
result
of
that
stevedoring
negligence.
the
shipowner
was
held
responsible
there
for
a
failure
to
give
the
--
the
person
non-delegable
duty,
the
failure
to
--
to
give
the
longshoreman
a
safe
place
to
work
which
is
a
non-delegable
duty
even
though
that
unsafe
condition
has
been
created
by
the
longshoreman's
employer.
and
this
court
held
that
the
longshoreman
had
breached
the
--
its
contract,
implied
contractual
obligation
to
do
the
work
properly
and
implied
and
read
into
the
contract
in
obligations
indemnified.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
well,
ryan
--
in
ryan,
the
unsafe
condition
was
created
in
george
town,
south
carolina
and
the
action
occurred
in
new
york.
in
our
case,
this
winch
shelter
was
built
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
in
new
york
and
the
accident
occurred
in
boston.
and
for
that
reason,
the
cases
become
being
so
similar
become
confused
when
they
shouldn't
be.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"well,
it's
a
george
town
case
when
the
stevedore
negligently
loaded
the
--
loaded
the
paper."
it
was
foreseeable
that
somebody
was
going
to
get
hurt
when
they
started
discharging
in
new
york.
and
they
read
into
the
--
into
the
contract,
the
duty
to
indemnify
for
foreseeable
injuries.the
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
well,
it
wasn't
put
to
the
jury
solely
on
that
--
on
that
issue.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
had
that
point
in
mind
that
there
--
there
is
evidence.
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
in
the
record
that
it
was
customary
when
the
stevedore
has
finished
work
in
one
port
when
the
ship
go
to
--
went
on
to
its
next
port
of
discharge
or
the
deck
crew
of
the
ship
to
tear
down
these
shelters.
but
the
evidence
is
also
appearing,
it's
overlooked
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
majority
opinion
that
the
reason
for
carrying
down
those
shelters
has
--
and
not
any
duty
to
the
stevedore
company
at
all.
it
is
so
that
they
will
have
room
to
maneuver
on
deck
to
secure
the
booms
of
the
ship
and
so
these
pieces
of
wood
won't
be
flying
around
and
injure
some
member
of
the
crew
during
the
course
of
the
voyage.
those
are
all
the
reasons
described
by
witnesses
for
the
plaintiff
which
is
uncontradicted
in
the
record.
those
were
the
sole
reasons
for
removing
shelters
at
sea.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
that,
your
honor.
the
court
--
there
was
a
conflict
of
evidence
throughout.
i
tried
to
avoid
that
to
make
the
facts
more
simple
but
there
was
a
conflict
of
evidence
at
the
trial,
conflict
of
testimony,
a
short
conflict.
all
of
the
ships'
officers
swore
up
and
down
that
these
shelters
had
been
removed
and
that
the
shelter
that
actually
caused
this
man's
damage
is
important
had
been
constructed
by
the
nacirema
employees
in
boston
rather
than
by
nacirema
employees
in
new
york.
but
the
longshoreman
in
boston
also
swore
that
it
was
there
when
they
--
when
the
ship
arrived
in
boston.
therefore,
by
--
although
they
were
prepared
with
knives
--
rather
with
hammers
and
nails
and
tarpaulin
and
all
the
rest
of
equipment
they
needed
to
build
shelters
in
boston,
they
saw
them
already
there
and
so,
they
used
them.
and
they
used
them
for
four
days
without
inspecting
in
any
way.
now,
i
think
the
fact
is
they
--
they
took
over
an
instrumentality,
that
was
created
by
the
same
company,
same
contractors,
adopted
--
readopted
rather,
used
it,
never
inspected
it.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
said
we
were
negligent.
well,
we
--
yes,
i
suppose
our
basis
of
negligence
is
that
we
let
it
stay
there
or
let
these
men
use
it
and
that
would
have
been
true
whether
it
was
built
in
boston
or
built
in
new
york.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
well,
the
court
said,
"if
on
the
other
hand
you
find
that
the
structure
was
there,
and
that
in
leaving
it
there,
making
it
available
to
these
men
to
work
that
the
shipper's
guilty
of
some
act
of
omission
or
commission,
which
act
of
omission
or
act
of
commission
was
negligent
and
that
brought
about
the
injury
then
you
might
find
the
verdict
for
mr.
conolly
on
the
first
cause
of
action
submitted,
was
permitting
it,
just
to
remain
there
and
letting
them
use
it.
that's
--
that
was
the
basis
of
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
we
owe
a
duty
to
any
business
invitee
to
get
a
non-delegable
duty
in
the
safe
place
to
work.
on
the
other
hand,
when
we
hired
an
independent
contractor
to
do
that
special
particular
work
and
to
supervise
it,
we
feel
that
the
duty
we
--
there's
no
duty
owed
to
that
independent
contractor
to
supervise
him.
certainly,
we
must
--
we
have
a
chief
officer
there
who
is
charged
in
law,
as
the
law
now
stands,
with
the
duty
of
saying
that
men
don't
hurt
themselves,
it's
possible.
in
other
words,
duty
of
due
diligence
and
reasonableness
of
inspecting
the
--
making
sure
they're
using
safe
equipment
and
safe
gear.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
that
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
in
majority
distinguished.
i
don't
agree
that
it's
--
the
(inaudible)
was
ryan.
it
distinguishes
it
on
those
facts,
your
honor.
those
--
that
is
where
the
facts
(inaudible).
there
was
a
different
set
of
facts
here.
in
--
in
ryan,
the
foreseeability
arose
in
george
town.
whereas
here
the
unsafe
condition
was
created
in
new
york
and
the
unsafe
condition
was
adopted
again
by
the
same
stevedore
in
boston.
as
judge
lombard
has
said
it,
"he
couldn't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
we've
taken
that
shelter
off
and
stowed
it
down
in
the
hold
and
they
put
it
right
back
up
again
when
they
got
there."
mr.
william
garth
symmers
yes,
sir.
it
was
indeed.
it
was
--
in
that
--
in
that
respect
to
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
under
the
chief
officer's
responsibility
and
supervision.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
only
in
--
only
in
permitting
that
condition
to
be
created.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
that
is
the
only
act
of
negligence
that
occurred
in
--
in
this
case.
there
was
no
other
act
of
negligence
to
the
--
either
to
the
stevedore
employee
or
to
--
to
anyone
else
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
in
this
case.
there
was
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
to
tear
this
structure
down
at
any
time.
it
was
customarily
done
at
sea
solely
because
it's
part
of
the
squaring
up
of
the
ship
and
has
to
do
with
the
ship
and
its
own
sailors
and
not
any
duty
towards
the
stevedore.
and
with
--
in
making
a
short
run
from
new
york
to
boston
if
it
left
those
structures
there,
that
beyond
--
that
was
in
violation
of
no
duty
to
anyone
other
the
seaman
if
a
seaman
might
have
gotten
hurt
in
the
process
of
cleaning
it
up
during
the
course
of
the
voyage.
but
the
jury
found
that
this
structure,
as
it
arrived
in
boston
was
the
very
same
structure
that
had
been
created
by
the
third-party
defendant
stevedore
at
new
york.
and
that
our
liability
was
in
permitting
these
men
passive
action
of
committing
the
(inaudible).
stevedore
created
it.
stevedore
was
in
charge
of
the
men.
they
were
the
specialist
at
discharging
the
ship
and
in
supervising
the
work.
they
expressly
contracted
to
do
this
work
properly,
with
the
proper
supervision
and
equipment.
the
--
the
piece
of
equipment
which
caused
this
man's
injury
was
no
part
of
the
ship.
the
jury
verdict
precludes
any
finding
to
that
effect.
so
the
ship
was
found
to
be
seaworthy.
and
i
think
the
definition
of
seaworthiness
given
by
the
district
judge
is
--
is
fair
enough
on
that
score.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
did
i
sir?
mr.
william
garth
symmers
yes.
our
motion
appear
in
the
record,
i
think
its
page
17.
we
made
all
the
motion.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
they're
all
in
that.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
i
believe
that
mr.
chief
justice's
overview
or
justice
black
asked
about
that
hatch
tent
question.
i
just
want
to
clear
that
up.
it's
on
page
66.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
that
was
a
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
immediately
--
mr.
william
garth
symmers
--
immediately
after
--
the
--
in
the
record,
immediately
after
--
where
the
contract
is
spelled
out
as
to
what
the
shipowner
will
supply
and
what
the
stevedore
will
supply.
mr.
william
garth
symmers
the
stevedore,
for
example,
is
to
supply
hatch
tents.
i
asked
the
witness.
you
just
heard
me
read
from
this
contract,
if
you
tell
a
jury
if
you
will
what
a
hatch
tent
is,
purposely
that
being
that,
they
confuse
it
with
one
of
these
shelters.
after
--
well,
there
--
there
are
different
types
of
hatch
tents
that
--
that
are
used
and
the
court
interjected
and
said,
"very
well,
all
right,
you
all
agreed
that
a
hatch
tent
isn't
the
type
of
shelter
that
is
in
question
in
this
case."
mr.
william
garth
symmers
i
think
that's
--
