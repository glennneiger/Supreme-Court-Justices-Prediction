mr.
leavenworth
colby
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
united
states
appears
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
because
of
its
great
importance
to
the
government
as
one
of
the
principle
operators
of
the
merchant
marine
and
additionally,
as
responsible
for
the
subvention
of
the
merchant
marine.
any
increase
in
cost
of
the
operating
of
ships
falls
upon
the
government
to
a
greater
or
less
extent.
and
accordingly,
we
are
interested
not
only
as
the
largest
customer
of
contracting
stevedores,
but
also
as
those
who
are
responsible
for
supporting
and
subventioning
other
customers
of
contracting
stevedores.
now,
this
if
the
court
please,
in
the
second
phase
which
is
the
phase
which
is
before
this
court
today
is
a
suit
by
the
customer,
the
ship
who
hired
a
professional
stevedoring
contractor
to
stevedore
its
vessel
in
a
skillful
and
proper
fashion.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
claim
of
the
client
against
the
expert
of
the
customer
against
the
contractor.
the
basis
of
the
claim
is
that
by
reason
of
a
breach
of
the
contact
by
the
contracting
stevedore
to
do
the
work
in
a
proper
fashion,
one
of
the
contracting
stevedores
own
employees
was
injured.
that
employee
recovered
a
judgment
against
the
ship
on
account
we
maintain
of
ultimately
the
negligence
of
the
contracting
stevedore.
and
the
ship
having
paid
for
that
brings
this
suit
to
obtain
reimbursement
of
the
money
it
was
required
to
pay
out
as
a
result
of
the
contracting
stevedore's
breach
of
contract.
and
accordingly
we
say,
the
concepts
of
primary
and
secondary
fault
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
question
here
is
purely
one
of
the
law
of
contracts.
the
ship
had
a
contract
to
have
the
work
done
properly.
the
contractor
breached
that
contract.
now,
i
would
like
to
look
for
a
moment
at
the
facts.
now,
mr.
connolly,
the
injured
longshoreman
who
got
hit
on
the
head
with
the
board
has
been
paid
off
some
$50,000
odd
and
this
suit
is
by
the
ship
who
paid
him
pursuant
to
the
judgment
to
be
reimbursed
that
amount
because
it
had
to
pay
it
as
a
result
of
the
breach
of
contract
of
its
professional
contracting
stevedore.
now,
the
facts
are
quite
simple.
the
ship
got
into
new
york
harbor
on
the
25th
day
of
january.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
deck
load
on
and
they
had
to
begin
first
to
take
the
deck
load
of
lumber
off
and
then
to
go
into
the
holds.
and
when
i
assumed
they
got
the
deck
load
off,
at
that
point,
the
winch
man
erected
in
new
york
shelters
to
keep
the
weather
off
of
him,
the
snow
and
the
rain.
those
shelters
which
were
erected
by
the
winch
man,
employees
of
the
contracting
stevedore
for
their
own
convenience
were
flimsy-like
structures.
they're
made
out
of
dunnage,
hard
boards
that
are
left
around
loose
and
they
put
over
them
tarpaulins
in
order
to
keep
off
the
weather.
now,
they
erected
them
some
time
subsequent
to
the
25th
day
of
january.
the
vessel
was
done
discharging
at
new
york
on
the
30th
day
of
january.
so
on
the
30th
day
of
january,
she
put
to
sea,
at
that
time
ordinarily,
the
longshoreman
would
have
been
expected
to
take
away
the
stevedore's
tarpaulins
from
this
flimsy
hatch
shelter
that
they
had
here.
but
whether
they
did
or
not,
when
the
vessel
arrived
at
boston,
the
following
day,
that's
one
day
later,
the
shelter,
the
hatch
shelter
was
still
in
place.
it
was
visible
whether
there
were
one
or
two
tarpaulins
over
it.
it's
doubtful
under
the
testimony
in
the
record
whether
it
could
be
certain
and
that's
of
course
important
because
it
was
light
loose
dunnage
placed
on
the
top
of
the
second
tarpaulin
which
was
blown
off
by
the
wind
and
precipitated
into
the
hold
hitting
mr.
connolly,
the
injured
man,
on
the
head.
now
--
so,
we
have
a
situation
that
the
professional
contractor
built
this
flimsy
structure
for
his
own
purpose.
it's
a
hindrance
to
the
ship
and
when
the
ship
gets
ready
to
go
to
sea,
it
should
take
it
off.
as
mr.
symmers
has
explained,
it
owes
that
duty
to
its
seamen.
when
they
got
into
boston,
the
ship's
personnel
say
that
the
shelter
was
gone.
the
stevedore
contractor's
personnel
say
the
shelter
was
still
there.
they
say
that
they
ordinarily
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
trade,
the
agreement
of
parties
go
aboard
with
hammer
and
nails
and
they
erect
such
a
structure
but
they
didn't
have
to
do
it
this
time
because
there
was
one
up
there.
now,
once
more,
i
want
to
remind
the
court.
the
ship
employs
the
professional
expert
stevedore
to
do
the
job
properly.
now,
if
there
was
some
kind
of
conjuries
of
boards
amounting
to
a
hatch
shelter
that
for
one
day
had
been
in
the
possession
of
the
vessel
while
it
was
at
sea
and
had
been
blown
about.
proper
stevedoring
practice
and
indeed
ordinary
common
sense
would
indicate
that
that
should
have
been
inspected
by
the
professionals
who
were
going
aboard
to
stevedore
the
vessel
and
who
would
have
to
erect
their
own
flimsy
structure
if
they
hadn't
found
the
remains
of
an
old
one
there.
the
record
however
shows
that
they
didn't
do
a
thing.
they
did
not
inspect
the
hatch
shelter
that
was
there.
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
and
they
went
on
stevedoring
using
this
hatch
shelter
which
the
company
had
built
at
new
york
and
which
had
been
in
the
possession
of
the
ship
just
one
day
at
sea.
and
after
five
days
of
using
the
structure
during
which
again
the
record
is
clear,
they
failed
absolutely
to
make
the
customary
inspections.
indeed,
i
think
common
sense
dictates
that
a
structure
of
this
sort
should
be
inspected
two
or
three
times
a
day.
the
winch
drivers
themselves
who
testified
for
the
plaintiff
said
that
matters
might
be
dislodged
from
it
by
wind
or
by
the
vibration
of
the
winches
in
operating
and
that
it
was
most
important
that
it
be
secured.
now,
because
they
say
that
the
ship
had
permitted
the
structure
to
remain
aboard
while
it
put
to
sea
and
came
in,
they
are
excuse
from
the
professional
duty
of
inspecting
that
structure
when
--
before
they
started
to
use
it
and
through
the
whole
of
five
days.
now,
if
the
court
please,
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
accident
happens
a
few
hours
after
the
longshoreman
come
along
or
as
in
this
case
five
days.
we
believe
that
when
a
ship
hires
a
contracting
stevedore,
it's
entitled
to
have
the
hatch
shelters
or
any
other
parts
inspected
immediately
before
they
begin
to
use
them.
but
we
don't
have
to
worry
with
that
here.
they
had
five
days
during
which
there
should
have
been
15
inspections
in
all
probability
and
none
were
made
until
after.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
they
were
an
integral
part
of
the
ship,
the
situation
might
very
well
be
different.
but
of
course
not
only
are
we
precluded
by
such
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
but
the
finding
of
the
jury
was
in
respect
of
the
instructions
on
unseaworthiness
that
the
hatch
shelter
was
not
impertinent
to
the
ship.so,
we
have
no
such
trouble.
however,
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that
even
it
had
been
a
part
of
the
ship
such
as
a
hatch
beam
with
the
defective
locking
device
or
anything
of
that
sort,
it
is
well
settled
under
the
decisions
that
the
professional
contracting
stevedore,
the
expert
which
his
hired
by
the
ship.
now
remember,
the
ship's
personnel
go
ashore
leaving
only
a
couple
of
men
around
to
take
care
of
the
ship.
they
don't
do
anything
about
the
stevedoring.
the
professional
stevedore
is
supposed
to
inspect
and
if
things
are
not
in
order,
he's
supposed
to
stop
work.
and
if
it's
a
job
that
the
ship
should
do
to
put
them
in
proper
order
then
the
work
stops
and
the
time
is
running
against
the
ship
until
the
ship
gets
around
to
fix
it.
now,
that's
exactly
what
wasn't
done
here.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
old
familiar
pattern
that
the
contractor
took
the
money
and
didn't
do
the
job
right.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
this
question,
about
intervening
acts
of
negligence.
the
second
circuit
by
a
very
distinguished
judge,
judge
waterman,
thought
that
the
failure
of
the
ship
to
remove
the
hatch
shelter
was
an
intervening
act
of
negligence
insolating,
i
take
it,
the
liability
of
the
contractor
for
having
built
a
flimsy
hatch
structure
but
by
the
same
token,
the
failure
of
the
contractor
to
perform
its
proper
professional
duty
to
inspect
the
shelter
before
working.
and
during
the
course
of
the
work
for
five
days
was
an
intervening
act
of
negligence
which
should
in
turn
insolate
the
situation
there.
but
actually,
this
conception
of
intervening
acts
of
negligence
is
not
appropriate
to
a
case
which
involves
contract
rights.
in
other
words,
the
question
we
have
here
is
when
the
ship
allowed
the
flimsy
structure
to
remain
aboard
when
it
put
to
sea
and
came
in
to
boston.
did
it
breach
its
contract
to
the
contracting
stevedore?
was
there
an
agreement
by
the
ship
that
it
would
for
the
benefit
of
the
contracting
stevedore
remove
the
hatch
shelter?of
course,
the
answer
is,
how
could
it
be?
to
the
extent
that
it
was
left
there,
it
put
the
contracting
stevedore
in
the
position
that
there
were
the
remains
of
a
hatch
structure,
of
a
hatch
shelter
which
it
could
refurbish
and
renew
and
put
in
shape
with
less
trouble.
there's
certainly
between
the
ship
and
a
professional
contractor
skilled
in
the
art
could
be
no
doubt
that
there
was
no
representation
by
the
ship
that
this
flimsy
structure
hadn't
been
withstanding
the
high
seas
and
winds
in
the
passage
from
new
york
to
boston.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right,
sir.
that's
why
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
there
was
one
or
two
contracts,
whether
the
same
stevedore
operated
at
new
york
or
boston
or
any
of
these
things.
the
question
is,
the
stevedores
at
boston
were
hired
to
do
a
proper
job.
when
they
got
aboard,
there
--
there
was
the
remains
of
a
flimsy
hatch
shelter
there.
it
was
their
duty
to
refurbish
that,
to
inspect
it
because
it
was
there
for
their
purpose.
we
make
conjecture
that
the
reason
it
was
left
there
is
very
likely
because
it
was
--
was
the
same
stevedore
in
both
places
and
it
saved
the
people
doing
work
in
the
second
port.
idle
speculation
but
it's
the
most
logical
explanation.
now,
in
other
words,
had
it
been
some
similar
flimsy
structure
there
and
a
new
stevedore
had
come
up.
the
new
stevedore
would
owe
the
ship
the
same
duty
of
professional
skill
in
here
to
look
after
it.
and
as
i've
said
to
your
honor,
even
if
it
had
been
a
part
of
the
ship
as
long
as
it
was
susceptible
of
discovery
by
inspection,
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
professional
contractor's
duty
to
his
customer
to
see
that
it
was
done.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
contractor,
a
great
deal
is
made
to
the
fact
that
it
was
difficult
to
detect
that
there
was
trouble
and
insufficiency
in
the
construction
of
the
shelter.
now,
that's
errant
nonsense
because
we
find
that
after
mr.
connolly
was
hit
on
the
head
by
a
board,
and
the
boards
by
the
way
were
one
inch
by
eight,
about
three
and
a
half
to
five
feet
long,
so
it's
little
light
dunnage.
after
that,
one
of
the
winch
drivers
simply
skipped
up
on
top
the
winch
and
being
up
that
high,
he
could
see
up
over
the
top
of
the
shelter
which
was
seven
foot
high
and
he
was
able
to
say
to
his
partner
that,
"now,
this
is
an
improper
way
to
put
a
hatch
shelter
together."
the
second
tarpaulin
isn't
secured
at
all.
they
just
laid
it
across
and
put
two
or
three
boards
on
top
of
it.
now,
that
they
could
have
found
by
similarly
getting
up
on
the
hatch
and
taking
on
the
winch
and
taking
a
look,
the
day
the
vessel
came
in
to
port.
it
is
to
my
mind
the
most
abominable
and
shocking
violation
of
a
professional
duty
on
the
part
of
a
contractor
to
its
customer
that
has
come
before
the
courts.
most
of
these
cases
involve
something
quite
latent
and
difficult.
and
you
might
feel
some
sympathy
for
the
contractor
even
though
he
was
a
professional
in
having
his
men
detect
what's
wrong.
but
this
was
the
most
obvious
matter.
nothing
except
the
claimed
breach
of
the
contractor's
duty
to
his
customer
ship
could
possibly
have
permitted
this
to
come
about.
i
think
frankly
it
is
a
shocking
thing
that
there
was
no
criminal
prosecution
for
the
negligence
in
failing
to
inspect
this
matter
daily
so
that
mr.
connolly
was
hit
on
the
head.
so
now,
that
is
the
very
crux
of
the
case,
not
that
it
was
erected
by
the
same
stevedore
contractor
in
new
york
but
that
after
it
had
been
a
--
but
a
single
day
in
the
possession
of
the
ship,
the
new
stevedore
contractor,
because
it's
a
different
group
of
men
even
though
it's
the
same
company,
the
new
stevedore
contractor
comes
aboard
and
he
doesn't
do
what
he's
paid
for
doing.
now,
we
in
our
brief
have
set
forth
at
great
length
the
considerations
of
why
it's
necessary
to
have
a
breach
of
contract
by
the
customer
before
the
customer
is
deprived
of
his
right
to
recover
against
the
contractor
who
doesn't
do
the
job
he's
paid
for.
now
here,
there
can
be
no
question
that
there
was
no
breach
of
contract
subsequent
to
the
breach
of
contract
by
the
contracting
stevedore.
there
is
nothing
in
the
testimony
anywhere
that
suggests
that
the
ship
did
anything
to
render
the
hatch
shelter
less
secure
once
the
stevedore
contractor
came
aboard
and
started
working.and
that
is
the
only
kind
of
testimony
we
believe
which
would
permit
a
denial
of
a
judgment
for
reimbursement.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
judge
should
have
granted
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
in
favor
of
the
customer
ship
and
against
its
expert
contractor
because
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
oh,
but
the
negligence
of
the
contractor
is
the
negligence
of
the
steamship
company,
too.
because
all
the
time
the
ship
owed
a
non-delegable
duty
to
mr.
connolly.
and
if
mr.
connolly
was
hit
on
the
head
by
a
board
as
a
result
of
the
negligent
performance
by
the
expert
contractor
of
a
duty
which
vis-à-vis
conolly,
the
ship
had
no
right
to
delegate,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
if
mr.
connolly
recovers
judgment
for
negligence.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
customer
is
not
entitled
to
recover
against
the
contractor
to
whom
he
delegated
the
non-delegable
duty.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
difficulty
with
that
your
honor
you
see
is
that
the
court
entirely
overlooked
the
supervening
negligence
of
the
stevedore
in
failing
to
inspect
the
shelter
that
was
carried
from
new
york
to
boston
before
working
and
as
he
was
continuing
with
the
work.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
mr.
connolly
had
been
hit
on
the
head
by
a
board
which
blew
off
before
the
contractor
at
boston
had
had
a
chance
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
to
look
at
it.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
oh,
in
new
york.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
of
course.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
because
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
it
would
not
have
furnished
a
safe
place
for
connolly
to
work.
in
other
words,
vis-à-vis
connolly,
there
is
a
non-delegable
duty
of
the
ship
to
furnish
him
a
safe
place
to
work
but
vis-à-vis,
the
contractor,
the
professional
expert
to
whom
the
ship
has
delegated
the
performance
of
a
non-delegable
duty,
the
ship
is
entitled
to
recover
reimbursement
for
its
breach
of
contract.
now,
that's
all,
if
your
honors
please,
there
is
in
the
case.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
right.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no.
and
we
think
it
is
not
different
that
by
a
circumstance,
the
contractor
who
breached
his
duty
in
boston
to
inspect
the
flimsy
structure
before
using
it
and
make
it
safe
was
the
same
contractor
who
breached
his
duty
by
erecting
an
improper
and
flimsy
structure
in
new
york.
and
the
fact
that
in
between,
the
ship
should
have
torn
it
down
does
not
affect
the
situation
because
there
are
two
intervening
acts
of
negligence.
and
the
last
negligence
and
the
last
breach
of
contract
is
on
the
part
of
the
contractor
at
boston.
now,
of
course
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
breach
of
contract
in
failing
to
tear
down
the
structure
when
they
put
to
sea
because
there
was
no
agreement
to
do
so.
the
jury
found
that
there
was
no
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
anybody.
and
so
clearly,
not
to
a
contractor
thus
far
a
contractor
is
not
entitled
to
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
things
grow
but
there's
simply
nothing
which
insolates
the
contractor
from
the
final
breach
of
contract
at
boston.
now,
of
course
we're
very
much
interested
in
this
because
we
hire
stevedore
contractors
all
the
time.
and
the
typical
situation
is
the
ship
doesn't
have
much
in
the
way
of
witnesses
because
it
only
has
two
or
three
men
aboard.
the
stevedore
contractor
and
the
injured
longshoreman,
they
have
their
people
all
over
the
ship
and
they
will
always
testify
for
their
employer
and
for
their
friends.
i
don't
mean
that
they
would
testify
falsely.
i
mean
that
there
are
people
there
who
saw
it
and
those
people
who
were
there
who
saw
it
are
for
the
most
part,
persons
who
were
not
ship's
people
and
who
maybe
presumed
to
be
hostile
to
the
ship.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
don't
think
i
know,
if
your
honor
please.
i
have
never
been
a
man
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
don't
think
i'd
like
to
mislead
you
for
saying
something.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
suppose
not.
i
suppose
the
obligation
of
the
ship
to
the
men
who
comes
aboard
to
do
the
work
is
a
tort
obligation
rather
than
a
contractual
one.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no.
there's
no
contract
between
the
--
the
employee
of
the
contractor.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
cases
hold
that
except
for
the
structure
of
the
ship
itself,
a
customer
does
not
make
any
warranty
to
the
professional
expert
that
it
employs
that
it
will
do
anything
to
protect
the
professional.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
contractor
who
undertakes
to
do
the
job
for
the
customer.
the
customer
does
not
undertake
to
protect
the
contractor
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
whom
he
employs
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
against
any
mistake.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no,
the
case
has
hold
there
that
vis-à-vis,
the
contractor,
the
customer
does
owe
a
duty
to
his
contractor
to
warn
him
of
latent
conditions.
this
of
course
was
not
a
latent
condition
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
the
contractor's
employees
skipped
up
on
top
of
the
winch,
he
was
able
to
see
what
was
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
dangerous.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
here,
it's
a
question
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
here,
it's
a
question
of
fact
but
that
was
taken
from
the
jury.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
that's
the
difference
between
the
relationship
of
client
and
expert
and
customer
and
contractor.
when
the
client
hires
a
lawyer,
he
does
not
undertake
to
advice
the
lawyer
and
protect
him
against
difficulties
and
mistakes
into
which
the
lawyer
may
fall.
the
lawyer
is
hired
as
the
expert.
so
in
this
situation,
the
ship
hires
the
professional,
skilled
stevedore
contractor
to
bring
his
supervisory
personnel
and
his
laborers
down
and
do
the
job.
that's
the
reason
they
hire
him.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
and
he
has
--
he
has
a
responsibility
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
the
contractors
here.
in
other
words,
if
the
contractor's
gear
breaks
and
injures
the
contractor's
employee,
the
contractor's
employee
may
recover
against
the
ship
because
the
ship
owes
a
non-delegable
duty
to
the
contractor's
employee.
and
it
must
answer
for
the
breaches
of
contract
of
the
professional
expert
that
he's
hired
to
perform
that
non-delegable
duty.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
ship's
gear
in
this
connection
i
think
would
probably
mean
the
difference
between
that
gear
with
which
say
the
booms
were
fitted
on
the
one
hand
and
the
contractor's
gear
in
most
instances
is
simply
the
slings
and
other
matters
that
the
contractor
brings.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
don't
suppose
that
it
belonged
to
the
ship.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
the
contractor
which
was
the
same
at
boston
and
new
york
erected
the
structure
and
employed
it
for
its
own
purposes
at
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--new
york.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
no.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
in
this
particular
circumstance,
if
it
was
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
precisely.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
the
contractor
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
assume
there
would
be.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
assume
there
would
be,
the
same
way
as
between
the
ship
and
the
contractor.
there
is
a
breach
of
contract
if
there
is
a
latent
defect
in
the
ship's
gear
or
equipment
and
the
ship's
people
failed
to
tell
the
contractor
of
it.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
you
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
probably
not
under
the
decisions,
if
your
honor
please,
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
a
contractor
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
see
the
easily
observable
defects.
in
other
words,
you
are
not
required
to
take
the
professional
by
the
hand
and
tell
him
that
there's
a
defective
condition
here
when
he
can
see
it.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
don't
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
i
think
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
this
court
and
other
courts
have
held
repeatedly
that
the
customer,
the
ship
in
this
case,
is
obliged
to
advise
the
contractor
of
matters
which
the
contractor
may
not
observe.
now,
mr.
symmers
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
contract
here
has
a
provision
in
respect
of
what's
to
be
ship's
gear
and
what's
to
be
contractor's
gear
at
page
65
of
the
record
at
the
bottom,
item
six,
the
equipment.
the
ship
is
to
supply
booms,
adequate
winches
and
good
order
with
sufficient
steam
or
current
for
their
efficient
operation,
flops,
topping
lifts,
guys,
wire,
or
rope
poles
of
sufficient
length
and
strength,
patch
tents,
lights
for
night
work,
tugs,
derricks
or
cranes
for
such
heavy
lifts
that
exceed
the
capacity
of
the
ship's
gear
and
cranes
in
the
absence
of
the
ship's
winches.
the
ship
is
also
to
supply
dunnage
paid
for
in
all
materials
for
shoring
and
lashing
cargo
as
well
as
rain
bags
and
separation
claws.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
contractor
is
to
supply
all
other
cargo
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
and
the
gear
and
equipment.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well,
hatch
tents
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
hatch
tents
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
is
an
expression
sometimes
loosely
used
for
these
winch
shelters.
technically
speaking
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
more
accurately
and
correctly
used,
a
hatch
tent
is
a
canvas
structured
to
put
over
an
open
hatch
in
case
of
rain
to
keep
the
rain
from
falling
into
the
hatch.
we
do
not
have
to
do
it
here
with
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
yes.
but
that
is
not
the
--
that
is
not
the
winch
shelter,
the
hatch
shelter
that's
involved
here.
this
is
the
canvas
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no,
if
your
honor
please.
the
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
the
contractor
built
it
at
new
york.
the
ship
failed
to
tear
it
down
when
it
went
to
sea.
when
the
ship
came
to
boston,
the
contractor
not
having
to
erect
one
because
there
was
one
there
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
no.
after
it
got
to
boston
and
the
contractor
took
it
over
and
made
it
his
own
and
used
it
for
five
days
without
inspection
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that's
what
their
evidence
shows.
the
winch
driver
testified
that
he
had
expected
to
go
aboard
and
erect
a
shelter.
he
had
his
hammer
and
nails
and
other
things
available
that
when
the
ship
came,
he
found
there
was
one
there
in
place.
so
he
went
aboard
and
at
no
time
from
then
until
after
mr.
connolly
was
injured
did
he
inspect
the
shelter.
directly
after
mr.
connolly
was
injured,
the
winch
driver
then
got
up
on
the
winch
where
he
could
see
the
top
of
the
structure
which
was
seven
feet
high
and
looked
at
it
and
saw
at
a
glance
immediately
that
there
were
light
dunnage
boards
merely
are
laid
on
top
of
a
second
tarpaulin.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
the
first
time
it
had
been
discovered.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
that
is
clearly
it
seems
to
me
patent
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
--
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
could
get
up
and
look
at
it.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
well
now
--
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
think
that
a
defect
becomes
latent
because
a
man
of
my
size
must
bend
over
in
order
to
look
underneath.
and
by
the
same
token,
i
don't
think
that
the
condition
of
the
top
of
the
shelter
became
latent
because
a
man
in
making
a
proper
routine
inspection
of
it
would
have
had
to
step
up
on
something
in
order
to
look
over
the
top
of
a
structure
seven
feet
high.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
if
your
honor
please,
this
case
was
not
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
leavenworth
colby
your
honor
is
making
a
convincing
argument
that
the
court
below
committed
error
in
failing
to
let
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury.
and
my
brother
of
course
is
apparently
entirely
content
with
that.
he
does
not
feel
as
the
government
does
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
sufficiently
clear
so
that
it
shouldn't
go
to
the
jury.
now,
your
honor
may
very
well
be
correct
and
certainly
counsel
for
the
party
at
interest
agrees
with
you.
thank
you.
