justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
true
then,
we
have
no
issue
here
as
(inaudible)
between
the
steamship
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
finding
that
the
steamship
(inaudible)
which
is
primarily
liable
was
not
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
didn't
do
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
contend
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
didn't
the
court
here
find
that
there
was
an
attempt
(inaudible)
on
the
part
of
the
steamship
company,
between
the
time
of
the
construction
of
this
shelter
over
the
hatch
in
new
york
harbor
and
the
time
the
ship
arrives
in
boston
harbor
with
the
shelter
still
on
it.
the
allegation
of
negligence
being
that
the
custom
was
and
in
the
duty
of
the
steamship
company
to
remove
that
shelter
before
they
left
new
york
and
they
failed
to
do
so
and
the
predicate,
that
the
jury's
finding
for
the
plaintiff
in
--
in
boston
was
that
the
shelter
was
still
present.
and
therefore,
the
steamship
company
was
negligible
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wasn't
there
evidence
however
that
there
was
(inaudible)
this
was
--
the
shelter
is
still
there
where
it
became
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
in
the
trial
court,
was
left
to
the
jury
as
the
basis
of
your
liability,
that
is
that
(inaudible)
independent
act
of
negligence
occurring
after
the
ship
had
left
new
york
harbor
and
before
it
arrived
--
arrived
in
boston.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
it
does
distinguish
this
case
from
ryan,
does
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
ryan,
the
roles
of
people
had
been
placed
by
the
stevedoring
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
had
to
(inaudible)
intervening
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
from
that
time
to
the
date
of
the
injury
of
the
--
of
the
stevedore.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
the
shelters
were
a
part
of
--
or
had
been
built
by
the
ship.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
your
review
then
legalistically,
there
is
no
difference
between
these
facts
and
what
would
have
been
the
situation
if
the
ship
had
stayed
in
new
york
harbor
and
only
a
night
had
intervened?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
could
he
have
done
that
when
you
had
just
predicated
in
his
submission
to
the
jury
the
liability
of
the
plaintiff
upon
the
negligence
of
the
steamship
company
in
permitting
these
shelters
to
remain
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
correct,
unless
--
and
the
district
court
(inaudible)
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
there
was
intervening
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
ship
company
in
not
removing
this
shelter
during
its
course
of
the
ship
from
new
york
to
boston.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
argue
that
this
is
not
(inaudible)
that
has
happened
in
boston
rather
than
in
new
york?
