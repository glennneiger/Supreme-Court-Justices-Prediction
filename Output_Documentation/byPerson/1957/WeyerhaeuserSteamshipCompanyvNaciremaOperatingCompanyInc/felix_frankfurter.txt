justice

you
meant
to
say
it
but
you
didn't
that
the
recovery
by
connolly
was
on
negligence
and
not
on
unseaworthiness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
essential
question
here
is
whether
the
arrangement
--
that
purpose
to
use
in
its
full
term
whether
the
arrangement,
meaning,
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
supplanted
or
--
supplanted,
yes,
the
finding
of
negligence
against
the
shipowner
as
between
a
shipowner
and
stevedore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
because
--
but
it's
relevant
or
is
it
relevant
that
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
the
shipowner
on
the
score
of
the
non-delegable
responsibility
of
seaworthiness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
the
jury
issue?
you
see,
i
believe
the
jury
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
you
just
said
at
least
he
was
at
the
jury.
what
would
be
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
asked
to
overrule
ryan
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
not
by
you,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
by
the
other
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
we
are
asked
to
overrule
ryan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner,
vis-Ã -vis
the
employee
in
ryan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
had
happened
to
connolly
10
minutes
after
the
shelter
was
up,
the
same
flimsily
built
shelter
as
you've
described
it,
the
steamship
company
would
have
been
liable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
after
they've
put
it
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
had
hit
connolly
five
minutes
after
it
was
erected,
before
any
of
the
steamship
company's
officers
could
do
anything
about
it,
the
steamship
company
would
have
been
liable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
--
there's
no
--
your
argument
gets
down
to
this
that
if
the
steamship
company,
if
the
ship
of
taking
out
an
insurance
policy
against
such
a
judgment
against
it
by
connolly
could
recover
against
the
insurance
company
and
the
insurance
company
couldn't
say,
"oh,
you
were
negligent."
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
colby,
just
as
a
matter
of
sheer
curiosity,
idle
curiosity,
of
the
merchant
marine
dunnage,
how
much
is
uncle
sam's
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
i
meant
is
--
never
mind.
i
just
--
i
was
curious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
putting
up
this
winch
shelter
a
part
of
the
stevedore's
function?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
was
--
it
was
something
done
by
the
stevedore
in
carrying
out
his
stevedoring
service,
isn't
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
that
if
i
hire
a
contractor
to
build
my
house
and
his
work
--
and
put
some
scaffolding
in
a
careless
way
and
that
does
damage
to
the
house
and
set
fire
to
the
house,
i
couldn't
say
that
he
wasn't
at
fault
of
his
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
you
bring
it
up
and
say
this
is
collateral?
it's
part
of
a
job,
you
hire
a
contractor
or
stevedore
to
do
a
job
and
if
he
does
the
job
incompetently
in
the
course
of
it,
when
presumably
he's
hired
to
do
it
competently,
that's
a
breach
of
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
a
third
outsider
testify
who's
heard
by
--
he
can
only
sue
on
the
basis
of
--
of
a
state
imposed
liability
to
where
it's
tort.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
i
hire
him
to
do
a
job
well,
he
has
to
do
the
job
well
in
all
these
incidences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
it
got
to
boston,
when
it
got
to
boston,
a
new
situation
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
the
ship
was
negligent
in
not
removing
it,
i'm
assuming
that,
on
the
trip
from
boston,
from
new
york
to
boston
doesn't
obliterate
the
meaning
of
what
happened
after
they
got
to
boston.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
those
equipments
furnished
by
the
ship?
i
thought
you
said
it
was
built
by
the
stevedore's
employees
for
their
own
wellbeing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
it's
there,
when
it
got
there,
it
didn't
therefore
as
a
matter
of
law
necessarily
forever
made
that
shelter
a
part
of
the
ship's
equipment,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
the
weather
in
boston
can
be
awfully
bad,
isn't
it?
you
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore,
it
became
the
equipment
or
the
shelter
put
up
there
by
the
ship
because
they
didn't
take
it
off,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
while
the
ship
was
in
--
at
berth,
it
was
the
stevedores
who
were
in
charge
of
unloading
or
loading,
whatever
they
did
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
was
their
people
who
are
--
who
are
--
who
found
this
shelter
which
was
put
up
for
their
comfort
against
the
elements
and
there
are
elements
also
in
boston
harbor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
the
jury's
finding
that
--
that
structure
wasn't
so
much
part
of
the
ship
or
to
allow
the
recovery
for
unseaworthiness,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
contrary
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
not
being
a
part
of
a
--
of
the
ships
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
your
argument
if
i
appreciate
it,
i'm
trying
to
follow
it,
is
in
effect
would
be
--
is
in
effect
saying
that
there
was
no
shelter
in
new
york.
there
was
no
such
winch
shelter
and
there
was
none
--
ship
sailed
up
to
boston
that
when
she
arrived,
the
steamship
company
put
up
this
structure
and
this
structure
then
hit
one
of
your
men.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
--
that
--
you're
reducing
it
to
a
situation
that's
just
like
that,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
when
you
--
when
they
got
to
boston
there,
it
is
as
though
this
had
been
put
up
by
the
steamship
company
and
it
--
and
it
--
the
result
was
that
your
man
was
hit
and
therefore
it's
like
some
other
negligently
constructed
contrivance
onboard
the
ship,
that's
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
that
in
effect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
independent,
sole,
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
on
--
if
you're
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
sole,
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
certainly
if
you
had
nothing
to
--
certainly,
you
have
no
duty
of
inspection
if
in
fact
you
took
something
that
the
company
gave
you,
which
is
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter

understood
