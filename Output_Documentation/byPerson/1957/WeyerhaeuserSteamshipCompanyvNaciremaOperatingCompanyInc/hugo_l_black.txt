when
a
ship
--
when
a
ship
makes
a
contract
to
the
stevedore
bringing
men
on
a
few
work,
does
the
ship
make
any
contract
in
connection
with
safety
of
the
place
where
they
have
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
draw
the
distinction?
it's
all
--
all
goes
out
of
the
contract
either
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
a
contract
between
the
stevedore
and
the
ship.
do
you
say
that
the
stevedore
breached
this
contract
and
--
because
he
comes
in
and
doesn't
inspect
this
flimsy,
flimsy,
flimsy
structure?
does
the
ship
make
any
agreement
with
the
contractor
that
he
will
--
these
men
will
not
be
subjected
to
a
flimsy,
flimsy
structure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
instead
of
having
a
flimsy
structure,
suppose
this
had
been
a
sling
gun
which
a
man
--
the
ship
knew
that
if
these
men
steps
there,
on
it,
he'd
get
shot.
do
you
mean
if
a
contractor,
the
shipowner
doesn't
contract
(inaudible)
subject
people
that
he
brings
in
there
via
contract
as
a
plaintiff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
--
you're
getting
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
into
the
facts
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
can
get
all
the
contracts
of
obligations
on
one
side.
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
seems
from
what
you
say
that
it's
all
kind
of
contracts
of
obligations
(inaudible)
stevedore
or
the
other
stevedore
company,
but
no
contracts
of
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
ship's
gear?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
gear
was
a
(inaudible)
that
the
thing
is
on
the
ship,
it's
there.
somebody
might
get
hurt
from
it,
a
part
of
great,
there's
an
agreement
that
it
won't
be
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
distinguish
between
one
kind
of
(inaudible)
if
this
belongs
to
the
ship
or
to
the
contractor,
this
flimsy
structure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
belong
to
this
boston
contractor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
i
didn't
understand
that
was
a
basis
for
the
court's
decision
or
your
argument
that
the
contractor
was
the
same
in
boston
as
in
new
york.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
weren't
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
going
back
to
the
lawyer,
the
expert
lawyer,
man
makes
a
contract
with
his
lawyer
and
he
lied
to
him
that
i've
got
this
gun,
this
is
mine,
he
tells
him
a
lie.
now,
the
lawyer
may
be
an
expert
but
he
may
not
be
an
expert
on
detecting
whether
a
fellow
is
telling
the
truth
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
--
well,
what
about
the
contractor
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
between
the
man
who
hires
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer,
wouldn't
that
--
not
be
a
breach
of
contract
if
he
lied
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
him
about
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what's
the
peculiar
(inaudible)
use
of
the
word
latent,
if
there's
a
defect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
that
defect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
the
shipowner
knows
about
it
and
the
other
man
doesn't,
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
there
be
a
breach
of
contract
if
he
failed
to
tell
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
court
required
to
go
further
and
further
with
the
idea
of
implied
contract,
of
course
they
have
all
the
obligation
on
the
side
of
the
ship
--
in
favor
of
the
ship
and
none
in
favor
of
the
other
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
no
mutual
obligations
between
them
under
this
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
without
regard
to
what
the
contract
is,
who
supplied
this
flimsy
built
structure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
whether
that
--
that
contract
because
i
understood
you
to
say
that
made
no
difference.
what
i
understand
is
from
your
statement,
(inaudible)
that
a
man,
one
contractor
had
put
up
a
flimsy
structure
on
the
ship
to
which
the
ship
left
it,
(inaudible).
after
they've
got
to
boston,
it
fell
and
hurts
somebody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
know?
did
the
evidence
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
first
time
it's
been
discovered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
latent
defect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
top
of
it
to
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
the
jury
reasonably
disagree
with
you
on
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
say
--
why
you
say
the
ryan
case,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
had
solely
held
that
it
was
--
he
was
negligent
during
the
work
that
created
--
that
was
(inaudible)
of
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
say
is,
there
was
evidence
from
which
it
could
be
firmed
that
you
had
not
put
this
(inaudible)
on
top
of
this
thing,
whatever
it's
for.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
maybe
the
shipowner
has
done
it
and
that
they
owed
you
some
kind
of
duty
there.
why
wasn't
that
a
jury
question
as
the
dissenting
judge
did
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
built
the
shelter
and
when
it
got
to
boston,
it
had
these
things
on
top
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
claiming
is
it
that
the
evidence
showed
beyond
any
doubt
so
that
nobody
could
doubt
it,
no
reasonable
man
could
find
that
you
had
put
this
up
on
the
tarp?
suppose
you
didn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
--
suppose
your
company
put
it
on
top,
back
in
new
york
and
stayed
there,
(inaudible),
hits
your
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
no,
no,
in
boston.
now,
of
course,
wouldn't
i
assume
that
they
--
it
was
the
duty
of
the
company
not
to
let
that
stay
on
and
on
the
way
up
to
boston.
but
suppose
they
did,
and
then
you
got
to
--
you
go
to
work
and
the
thing
you
put
on
there,
rolled
over
and
you
hit
your
back,
hit
his
back.
why
would
that
not
be
a
jury
question
of
whether
you
did
it
or
whether
they
did
it,
if
that's
what
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
did
and
yet
you
worked
on
it
for
some
days
and
it
has
not
been
done.
and
that
the
jury
could
find
that
you
should
have
--
you
even
knew
or
should
have
known
that
it
was
still
on
top
of
it.
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
basis
for
a
jury
finding
of
negligence
on
your
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
what
happened
afterwards?
