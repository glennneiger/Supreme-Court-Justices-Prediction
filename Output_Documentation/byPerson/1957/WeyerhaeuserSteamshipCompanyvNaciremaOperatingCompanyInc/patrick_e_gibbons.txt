mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
had
--
i
represent
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
we
have
two
transactions
here,
one
in
new
york,
where
we
unloaded
some
of
the
lumber
from
the
ship,
and
one
in
boston,
where
we
completed
the
unloading.
and
mr.
symmers
who
represent
the
ship
claims
that
we
are
liable
to
indemnify
him
for
negligence
or
breach
of
contract
in
new
york.
and
the
united
states
government
says
that
we
should
indemnify
the
ship
because
of
breach
of
contract
which
occurred
in
boston.
i'd
like
to
take
--
take
it
from
the
new
york
first.
when
the
ship
came
into
new
york,
it
had
a
load
of
lumber
which
we
started
to
unload.
the
evidence
which
sustains
the
inference
that
we
erected
this
shelter
over
--
over
the
winches
is
evidence
given
by
the
plaintiff's
witnesses
and
by
the
ship
itself
that
there
was
an
invariable
custom
in
every
harbor
in
new
york
that
longshoremen
erected
those
shelters.
and
that
as
soon
as
the
work
was
done,
the
ship's
personnel
removed
it.
when
the
contract
was
drawn
between
the
ship
and
the
stevedore
that
--
that
custom
was
well-known
to
both
sides
and
they
must
have
--
we
must
presume
that
the
--
the
contract
was
made
in
full
knowledge
that
that
condition
existed.
now,
the
ship
of
course
denied
that
there
were
any
shelters
on
the
decks
when
it
came
into
boston.
they
swore
that
there
were
--
the
witnesses
swore
there
were
not
--
no
shelters
there
that
they
would
have
been
guilty
of
gross
negligence
if
they
had
allowed
the
shelters
to
stay
on
deck.
the
ship
argues
that
they
didn't
owe
us
any
duty
to
remove
the
ship.
but
if
that
were
so,
we
would
still
be
responsible.
the
were
temporary
shelters.
we'll
be
responsible
for
their
condition
if
they
had
no
duty
to
us.
we'd
still
be
responsible
if
they
caused
injury
to
their
seamen
or
to
their
--
to
anybody
on
the
deck
until
they
were
removed.
there's
the
--
we
lost
control
of
the
shelters
and
i
would
think
that
under
any
reasonable
interpretation,
the
ship
owed
us
the
obligation
under
this
custom
to
remove
those
shelters.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
intervening
negligence
and
that
intervening
if
you
might
call
it
breach
of
their
implied
warranty
to
the
implied
agreement
that
they
would
remove
those
shelters.
the
trial
judge
after
the
jury
had
returned
the
verdict
holding
that
the
ship
was
liable,
the
trial
judge
directed
a
verdict
in
favor
of
us
on
the
indemnity
claim.
and
the
majority
in
the
circuit
court
affirmed
that
on
the
same
basis
that
there
was
intervening
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
ship
which
distinguished
it
from
the
ryan
case
where
there
was
no
intervening
negligence.
and
the
reason
and
other
distinction
in
that
case,
not
every
--
i
would
think
that
not
every
act
of
collateral
negligence
that
occurs
in
connection
with
the
--
the
performance
of
a
contract
gives
rise
to
an
action
for
a
breach
of
contract.
it
gives
rise
to
an
action
for
--
in
tort
for
negligence
against
the
contractor
because
he's
responsible
for
his
employee's
negligence.
but
i
don't
think
that
you
can
take
every
collateral
act
of
negligence
of
that
sort
which
occurs
in
connection
with
the
loading
and
unloading
of
the
ships
and
say
that
this
is
a
breach
of
contract
rather
than
this
is
tort.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
of
limitations
could
be
extended
to
give
such
causes
of
action
after
six
years,
benefit
of
the
six
years
statute
under
--
rather
than
the
benefit
of
the
three
year
statute
which
is
for
negligence.
now
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
in
the
--
in
the
ryan
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
well,
the
ryan
case
dealt
with
negligence
in
doing
the
exact
work
to
--
the
substantial
work
which
they
were
employed
to
do.
the
stevedore
had
undertaken
to
load
the
ship.
he
unloaded
it
--
he
loaded
it
improperly.
and
as
a
result
of
improper
loading
which
was
a
breach
of
his
contract,
the
injuries
resulted.
in
this
case,
there's
no
claim
that
we
were
negligent
in
unloading.
this
was
a
--
a
negligence
in
connection
if
its
negligence
at
all
in
connection
with
some
collateral
matter,
the
shelter
that
was
erected
for
the
convenience
of
the
employee.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
it
was
--
it
really
didn't
--
it
was
nobody's
function.
actually,
what
happened,
the
stevedore
employees
put
it
up
for
their
own
convenience
to
protect
them
against
the
rain
and
the
snow
if
there
were
snow.
it
had
nothing
to
do
--
it
was
--
it
wasn't
part
of
a
written
contract.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
it
was
--
it
was
a
collateral
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
yes,
it
was
a
collateral
(inaudible).
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
it
was
according
to
this
--
same
to
say,
construction
employees
in
cold
weather.
they
light
fires
to
keep
themselves
warm.
i
think
if
--
if
through
some
mishap
or
rather
a
fire
occurred
that
the
action
would
not
be
for
breach
of
contract
against
the
construction
contractor,
it
would
be
for
negligence
because
he
would
be
responsible
for
the
negligence
of
his
employees.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
oh,
i
would
think
in
that
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that's
a
breach
of
contract,
yes.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
and
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
i
would
think
so.
but
there
are
--
there
are
collateral
things
which
really
aren't
part
of
the
contract
in
which
i
don't
think
would
give
rise
to
an
action
for
a
breach
of
contract.
but
a
part
from
that,
the
distinction
made
by
circuit
court
that
this
--
the
damage
from
the
erection
of
the
shelter
in
new
york
was
not
foreseeable
as
a
damage
was
in
the
ryan
case.
in
the
ryan
case,
the
damage
was
foreseeable.
there
was
no
intervening
negligence.
in
our
case,
once
the
shelter
was
finished,
we
understood
and
we
had
a
right
to
understand
that
the
ship
would
remove
it,
that
it
would
not
be
left
on
standing
until
it
got
to
boston.
that
it
would
not
be
used
again.
it
was
just
a
temporary
structure.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
this
case
and
the
ryan
case.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
yes,
when
at
that
--
when
it
goes
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
no,
when
it
got
to
boston
your
honor,
the
ship
turned
it
over
to
the
stevedores
for
use
as
a
shelter.
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
is
that
it
looked
perfectly
all
right
when
it
came
in
to
boston.
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
it.
you
couldn't
see
it
by
casual
inspection
which
--
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question.
i
think
that
the
law
is
definite
that
a
stevedore
does
not
owe
a
duty
to
the
ship
to
inspect
any
equipment
furnished
by
the
ship
for
use
by
its
employees,
the
american
mutual
against
matthews
and
the
sieracki
case,
both
hold
that
that
if
there's
equipment
furnished
by
the
ship,
the
stevedore
is
entitled
to
use
it
without
inspection
unless
it's
obviously
defective.
(inaudible)
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
in
new
york.
it
was
not
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
no,
your
honor.
but
the
ship
in
not
removing
it
adopted
it.
it
was
not
meant
by
the
stevedores
to
continue
--
titled
to
--
it
did
not
continue
on
the
stevedores.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
they
--
they
--
hasn't
--
it
come
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
no.
but
it
was
furnished
by
the
ship,
adopted
it.
they
furnished
it
to
the
stevedores
in
boston
for
use.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that's
correct.
but
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
--
the
--
the
shelter
is
not
even
in
the
same
condition
i
would
think
as
it
was
in
new
york.
from
the
weather
--
from
new
york
to
boston,
the
evidence
is
that
it
was
very
--
a
stormy
weather
and
there
is
--
actually,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
we
put
the
boards
on
top
of
this
shelter
at
all.
there
is
evidence
or
at
least
as
an
inference
from
the
custom
that
we
erected
a
shelter
or
erected
shelters.
but
i
think
when
you
--
when
you
go
that
far
with
the
inference,
you
exhaust
its
possibility.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
you
can't
infer
because
we
erected
a
shelter
that
we
put
boards
on
top
of
it
which
are
no
essential
part
of
the
shelter's
structure.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
there
is
no
finding
by
the
jury
that
this
was
part
of
the
ship
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
--
so
as
to
render
it
liable.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
there's
a
--
they
find
it
that
it
was
not
unseaworthy.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
but
there
is
a
finding
that
the
ship
furnished
it
to
the
stevedores
for
use
which
was
the
basis
for
the
finding
of
negligence
because
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
unless
they
found
that
the
ship
furnished
this
for
use
to
the
stevedores
and
that
it
was
defective
and
that
the
ship
knew
it
was
defective
then
there
could
be
no
recovery.
now
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that's
correct,
your
honor,
at
least
that
the
inference
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
they're
a
different
sets
of
employees.
what
i
think
is
that
the
difference
is
that
this
--
the
shelter
which
we
built
in
new
york
was
not
intended
to
remain
on
the
ship
as
far
as
possible.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
i
think
it's
legally
different
your
honor
because
the
--
the
ship
had
gone
through
a
very
rough
voyage
from
new
york
to
boston.
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
shelter
was
in
the
same
condition
when
it
left
new
york
as
when
it
arrived
in
boston.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
the
--
on
--
the
evidence
as
to
the
condition
of
the
weather.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
not
as
to
those
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
as
to
the
shelter
brought
by
the
ship
was
that
it
wasn't
there
that
there
was
no
shelter
on
--
on
the
ship
when
it
got
into
--
into
boston.
and
of
course,
we
couldn't
tell
anything
about
the
shelter
except
that
we
saw
a
shelter
there
when
it
did
come
into
boston.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
the
ship
--
the
ship
would
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
--
would
be
liable
if
--
if
it
had
no
notice
or
a
constructive
notice
of
the
condition.s
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
i
would
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
and
under
those
circumstances
i
think
if
the
--
it
was
shown
that
we
erected
the
structure
in
that
way,
i
think
that
we'd
be
liable.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
no
proof
that
the
--
first
of
all,
there
is
proof
of
the
ship's
negligence
in
failing
to
remove
that
shelter.
that
--
that
was
something
we
had
a
right
to
rely
on.
we
had
a
right
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
would
remove
it.
now,
there
is
no
proof
that
the
condition
was
the
same
in
boston
as
it
was
in
new
york.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
except
the
proof
of
the
captain's
--
the
captain
and
the
crew
that
the
--
this
canvas
on
top
would
have
not
stayed
on
there
and
then
the
winds
that
they
encountered
unless
something
were
to
put
on
to
hold
it
down.
the
inference
that
the
--
the
boards
were
put
on
to
hold
the
canvas
on
it
as
least
as
reasonable
as
the
inference
that
they
were
put
on
in
--
in
new
york,
it's
stronger
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
ship
is
entitled
to
take
the
most
favorable
inference
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
well,
i
think
that
that
would
--
to
find
that
we
put
the
boards
on
top,
there
would
be
a
sheer
speculation.
the
--
the
circumstantial
evidence
which
justifies
the
inference
that
we
built
the
shelter,
i
don't
think
it
was
far
enough
to
justify
an
inference
that
we
built
the
shelter
negligently.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
it
had
the
--
yes.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
i
don't
quite
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
in
new
york?
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
connection
with
that
that
the
ship
had
a
--
a
contractual
duty
to
us
to
remove
that
--
that
shelter
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
--
not
to
leave
it
there.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
well,
i
think
there
would
be
no
evidence
to
sustain
a
jury
finding
that
we
knew
it
was
on
top
as
to
whether
we
should
have
known.
i
think
that
depends
on
what
duty
of
inspection
we
owed.
because
the
equipment
was
--
presumably,
it
was
presumptively
as
it
stood
furnished
to
us
for
use
by
the
--
for
use
by
us
by
the
ship.
we
used
it
in
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
be
used
and
that
it
looked
on
casual
inspection
seemed
to
be
all
right.
now,
the
--
the
law
seems
to
be
clear
that
you
don't
owe
a
duty
to
the
ship,
at
least
the
stevedore
doesn't
owe
a
duty
to
the
ship
to
inspect
equipment
which
is
given
to
it
for
use
so
long
as
it
uses
the
equipment
in
the
way
which
is
it
supposed
to
be
used.
and
the
case
is
cited
in
all
the
briefs
seem
to
sustain
that
unless
the
stevedore
knows
or
is
told
that
the
equipment
furnished
by
the
ship
is
defective,
he's
entitled
to
assume
that
it's
safe.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
what?
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
failing
to
remove
it,
the
ship
adopted
it
as
its
own
structure.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
and
became
responsible
for
its
condition.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that
in
--
in
effect,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
argument.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
i
think
that
in
failing
to
remove
it,
that
the
ship
adopted
it
as
its
own
and
in
furnishing
it
to
this
--
to
the
stevedores
for
use
in
boston
without
inspection,
it
was
guilty
of
independent
negligence
and
guilty
of
breach
of
contract
which
deprives
us
on
the
right
to
indemnity.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
on
that
--
on
that
basis
of
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
--
whatever
had
happened
before
that
would
have
been
eliminated.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
then
--
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
well,
what
happened
afterwards
depends,
your
honor.
it
--
it
may
well
be
as
your
honor
suggest
that
there
--
that
there
might
--
a
question
of
fact
might
have
survived,
although
i
don't
think
that
we
owed
that
duty
of
inspecting
the
--
the
shelter
to
find
out
what
condition
it
was
in.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
that
is
the
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
e.
gibbons
well,
i
--
i
think
your
honor
that
it
was
conceded
on
the
trial
that
this
shelter
was
not
a
hatch
tent
as
defined
as
mentioned
in
the
contract.
it
was
a
different
--
different
type
of
structure.
but
i
think
that
on
that
basis
your
honor
that
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
