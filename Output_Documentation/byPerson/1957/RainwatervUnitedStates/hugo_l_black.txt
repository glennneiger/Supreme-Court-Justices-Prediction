how
long
were
they
made
after
the
original
act
was
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
get
much
argument
there
except
that
those
two
congressmen
assuming
that
if
--
how
can
you
make
those
two
congressmen
believe
perhaps
that
the
--
the
original
bill
actually
didn't
cover
the
--
this
situation?
you
--
you
couldn't
get
much
quote
now
by
that
near
the
fact,
even
of
all
the
congress
said
to
believe
the
act
meant
something
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
i
--
i
meant
the
--
so
far
as
the
history,
is
there
anything
else
in
the
history?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
delighted
to
know
that
my
brother
respects
history
in
judicial
legislation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
words
in
the
statute
have
filed
any
claims
upon
or
against
any
department
or
officer
thereof
limit
in
anyway
the
previous
phrase
against
the
government
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
first
--
first
clause
in
it
is
any
claim
upon
or
against
the
government
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
next
one
is,
or
any
department
or
officer
thereof.
what
i'm
asking
was
in
your
judgment
to
the
last
words
limit
the
scope
or
the
meaning
of
a
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
--
would
you
think
the
first
clause,
the
government
of
the
united
states,
would
mean
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
perhaps
doing
business
by
agent?
how
can
it
do
business
except
by
agents?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
not.
the
question
i
was
asking
was,
supposed
there
has
been
no
language
(voice

suppose
there
had
been
no
language
in
the
original
act
except
a
false
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states,
what
kind
of
conduct
on
whose
party
who
would
provide
a
basis
for
alleging
a
violation
of
the
acts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
supposed
it
had
been
written
that
way
of
course
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
it
had
been
written
that
way,
corporations
have
come
in
existence
40
years
later
doing
business,
carrying
on
the
government's
business,
would
you
think
it
--
false
claim
against
the
corporation
would
authorize
a
suit
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
think
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
what
i
mean,
it
has
the
word
“department”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
--
i
don't
quite
get
the
pertinency
of
that
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
well,
this
--
the
government
of
the
united
states,
of
course,
is
in
one
part
and
then
it
says
our
department
or
officers,
can
you
put
those
together
or
do
you
draw
any
on
the
argument
that
by
limit
by,
mentioning
department
or
officer
that
--
that
somehow
under
the
doctrine
or
rules
that
has
been
spelled
out
of
the
interpretation.
limits
the
idea
of
--
of
what
would
be
included
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
just
mentioned
or
do
you
consider
that
there
are
two
separate
things
--
three.
one,
false
claim
against
the
government.
two,
false
claim
against
a
department.
three,
false
claim
against
the
officer
of
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
they're
all
there
together
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
--
who
--
whose
employees
are
the
--
those
who
work
for
the
commodity
credit
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
under
civil
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
person
working
for
the
commodity
credit
corporation
that
are
not
government
employees?
justice
hugo

are
there
any
corporations
of
that
kind
