mr.
leon
b.
catlett
--
the
complaints
in
this
case
were
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
at
little
rock,
arkansas.
one
of
the
complaints
is
against
r.s.
rainwater
&
sons,
a
partnership
and
other
against
citizens
national
bank
of
walnut
ridge,
arkansas.
jurisdiction
in
both
complaints
is
grounded
upon
a
false
claims
statute.
it's
alleged
that
these
petitioners
made
and
caused
to
be
made
and
presented
and
caused
to
be
presented
false
claims
to
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
an
agency
at
instrumentality
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
briefly,
it's
alleged
in
these
complaints
that
these
petitioners
caused
to
be
transmitted
to
commodity
credit
corporation,
14
transmittal
letters
on
which
were
listed
98
cotton
producers'
notes,
secured
by
bales
of
cotton,
which
was
ineligible
under
the
commodity
credit
corporation
cotton
program
for
1949
and
caused
commodity
credit
corporation
to
pay
these
notes.
and
as
shown
by
the
transmittal
letters,
which
commodity
credit
corporation
would
not
have
done
if
it
had
known
the
true
facts.
now,
motions
to
dismiss
were
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
those
motions
were
sustained.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.eight
circuit
reversed
in
242
f.2d,
this
case
came
upon
certiorari.
now,
as
i
say,
the
jurisdiction
in
each
of
these
complaints
is
based
upon
the
false
claims
statute.
the
false
claims
statute
was
enacted
in
1863.
it
originally
provided
in
the
one
statute
for
criminal
punishment
and
civil
recovery
against
any
person
who
should
make
or
cause
to
be
made
or
present
a
cause
to
be
presented,
a
false
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
a
department
or
officer
thereof.
it
was
just
the
one
statute
provided
for
criminal
penalties
and
civil
recovery,
and
that
was
in
1863.
in
1878,
the
false
claims
statute
was
divided
into
a
civil
portion
and
a
criminal
portion,
1878.
the
civil
portion
became
revised
statutes
3490
and
it
provided
that
any
person
who
should
do
any
of
the
acts
--
commit
any
of
the
acts
recorded
in
the
criminal
portion
of
the
statute,
which
is
revised
statutes
5438,
should
be
responsible
to
the
government
by
a
suit
for
double
damages
and
a
forfeiture
in
the
amount
of
$2000.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
civil
portion
of
the
false
claims
statute
was
3490
and
yet
adopted
by
reference,
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
portion
which
was
5438.
5438
remained
that
any
person
should
be
punished
criminally
for
making
and
presenting
to
the
--
a
false
claim
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
a
department
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
or
an
officer
thereof.
now,
that's
the
status
in
which
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case.
now,
3490
has
never
been
amended
or
dealt
with
or
touched
in
any
manner
by
congress.
its
revised
statutes
3490
that
we're
treating
with
in
this
case
and
it
adopted
by
reference
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
section
5438.
now,
5438
was
repealed
in
1909
and
superseded
by
section
35
of
the
criminal
statutes.
it
didn't
change
it
in
any
other
manner.
it
still
says
that
a
man
shall
be
punished
criminally
for
making
or
causing
to
be
made
or
presenting
or
causing
to
be
presented
a
false
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states,
or
a
department
or
officer
thereof.
now,
that's
1909.
now,
in
1918,
due
to
the
government
corporations
which
had
or
began
to
spring
up,
in
1918,
this
criminal
statute
now,
5438
which
subsequently
in
1909
became
section
35
of
the
criminal
code
was
amended.
the
criminal
section
was,
to
provide
that
--
add
these
words,
that
anymore
persons
who
makes
a
cause
to
be
made
or
presents
a
cause
to
be
presented
of
--
of
false
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
a
department
or
officer
or
a
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
stockholder,
shall
be
punished
criminally.
now,
that
was
in
1918.
now,
at
the
present
time,
that
criminal
section
is
found
in
the
code
in
title
18
section
1001
and
section
2
--
title
18
287.
it
was
split
but
the
criminal
section
is
still
to
all
intense
and
purposes
as
it
was,
after
it
had
been
amended
in
1918.
but
again,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
statute.
it's
--
this
case
is
brought
under
the
revised
statutes
3490.
now,
in
the
code,
it
says
that
it's
section
231
of
title
31
but
that
is
just
the
west
publishing
company's
idea
about
it,
i
guess
you'd
say,
because
when
i
read
and
traced
it
back,
i
wrote
west
publishing
company
to
find
out
if
they
haven't
made
an
error
and
they
then
gave
me
the
details
of
the
history
of
revised
statutes
3490.
and
as
i
say,
that
is
the
section
that
we
are
dealing
with
and
that
section
has
never
been
ordered
or
amended
or
dealt
with
in
anyway
by
our
congress
since
1878
and
when
it
adopted
that
reference
5438.
and
of
course,
this
court
held
in
the
in
re
east
company
and
kendall
against
united
states
and
of
course,
it's
always
been
the
law
that
when
one
statute
adopts
another
statute
by
reference,
any
changes
in
the
adopted
statute
does
not
affect
the
adopting
statute.
so,
any
changes
that
were
made
in
the
criminal
section,
revised
statutes
5438,
as
it
was
changed
in
1918
did
not
affect
the
civil
--
false
claims
statute
3490
on
which
these
complaints
were
based.
now,
the
--
this
court
said
in
united
states
marcus
--
ex
rel.
marcus
versus
hess
case
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
to
discover
and
not
direct
the
legislative
will.
now,
in
this
case,
we
would
love
to
see,
what
was
the
intension
of
congress
in
the
amending
of
the
criminal
statute
5438,
the
best
place
to
look
we
thought
would
be
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
that
amendment.
it
--
mr.
gard,
congressman
who
--
congressman
gard,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
at
the
time
of
the
proposal
of
the
amendment
to
the
criminal
section
5438
said
that
it
was
proposed
in
order
to
extend
the
provisions
of
5438
so
as
to
cover
a
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
stockholder.
that
is
the
house
--
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
proposed.
now,
when
it
was
presented
on
the
floor
of
the
house
for
passage,
in
the
absence
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
representative
argall
again
explained
to
the
house,
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
expand
or
extend
the
provisions
of
that
criminal
statute
5438.
not
simply
to
interpret
it
but
to
extend
it
to
make
it
cover
something
that
it
hadn't
covered
before
namely,
the
pre
--
presentation
of
a
false
claim
to
a
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
stockholder.
this
court
in
a
footnote
in
the
late
case
of
united
states
against
bramblett,
i
think,
it's
found
in
348
united
states,
briefly
explained
the
legislative
history
of
the
criminal
statute
5438
by
stating
in
that
footnote
that
the
amendment
in
1918
was
to
extend
the
provisions
of
that
section,
so
as
to
cover,
of
course,
something
that
it
had
not
covered
before,
namely,
a
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
stockholder.
so,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
that
5438,
which
was
adopted
by
3490
in
1878,
did
not
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
include
a
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
stockholder
and
did
not
so
--
and
as
--
and
the
criminal
statute
did
not
include
that
until
1918
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
made
to
that
section.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
believe,
it
would
have
been
the
same,
your
honor,
because
it's
our
position
that
5438,
it
--
it
has
to
be
read
into
3490
in
1878
and
--
and
can't
be
any
amendment
to
5438
affects
in
no
3490.
i
believe,
we
had
been
in
the
same
position
or
we
wouldn't
have
had
if
it
hadn't
been
amended.
we
wouldn't
have
those
expressions
of
representative
argall
or
of
representative
gard,
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
the
--
they
were
made
at
the
time,
the
1918
amendment
was
proposed
to
congress,
40
years
after
the
original
act
1878
was
--
when
the
original
false
claim
act
was
divided
into
a
civil
portion
and
a
criminal
potion.
this
amendment
came
in
1918,
which
would
be
40
years
and
the
statements
were
made
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
proposed
and
presented
for
passage.
and
we
think
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
took
a
little
comfort
from
the
statement
this
court
made
in
the
footnote
in
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
not
did
i
was
able
to
find.
i
did
find
that
footnote
though
and
i
took
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
--
some
comfort
from
that
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
--
where
this
court
said.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
so
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
well,
sir
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
[laughs]
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
well,
anyway
it
--
it
appeared
to
me
too,
that
the
intention
of
congress
could
be
gathered
from
its
--
what
--
what
was
done
at
the
time
the
commodity
credit
corporation
act
was
passed.
the
senate
proposed
that
a
certain
section
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation
act
would
give
the
commodity
credit
corporation
government
immunity.
now,
that
wasn't
--
the
house
didn't
concur.
so,
when
the
bill
was
passed,
i
think,
it
was
714
(e)
of
that
--
of
title
15
which
is
commodity
credit
corporation
act.
when
the
--
when
the
bill
was
finally
passed,
the
commodity
credit
corporation
was
given
priority
in
payment
of
claims
against
insolvents,
bankrupts
and
the
estates
of
deceased
persons.
what
was
not
given,
government
immunity,
as
the
senate
wanted
in
the
bill?
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
supposed
to
say
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
if
--
if
it
had
--
i
--
i
thought
this,
may
it
please
your
honor,
that
if
they
had
written
into
that
section
that
all
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
possibly,
from
suit.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
no,
sir.
it
is
not
in
the
statute
and
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
from
suit
i
would
assume.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
commodity
credit
corporation
act,
i
believe,
was
1945.
i
am
not
certain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
that's
right.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
don't
know.
the
senate
proposed
that
but
the
house
did
not
concur.
and
i
--
i
thought
this,
that
if
they
had
said
that
the
commodity
credit
corporation
had
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
united
states,
our
case
would
be
much
weaker
that
when
the
house
struck
out
that
provision
and
says
that
it
does
not
have
that
but
it
does
have
only
the
right
of
priority
and
payment
for
claims
against
insolvents
bankrupts,
and
estates
of
deceased
persons.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
it
wasn't
done,
your
honor.
and
then
came
along
the
corporation
control
act
of
1945
and
there
again,
we
can
look
at
what
the
congress
intended
about
commodity
credit
corporation
because
in
this
commodity
--
in
this
corporation
control
act
of
1945.
it
provided
that
this
government
corporation
of
--
should
have
not
a
governmental
audit,
as
that
term
is
viewed
but
should
have
a
commercial
audit.
in
other
words,
they
shouldn't
--
an
audit
would
be
made
of
a
government
corporation,
such
as
commodity
credit
corporation
would
be
an
audit
not
to
the
--
as
--
as
you
give
a
government
agency
would
--
would
see
whether
the
money
had
been
expended
according
to
congressional
authorization
but
in
audit
on
one
of
these
government
corporations.
it's
an
audit
just
like
you
would
have
of
any
other
corporation,
to
make
up
your
profit
and
loss
statement
and
to
determine
if
the
money
had
been
expended
by
the
corporation
according
to
the
--
authors
of
the
directors
of
that
corporation.
so,
it
provided
for
a
different
type
of
audit
for
these
government
corporations
then
for
a
government
agency.
and
also,
the
corporation
control
act
of
1945
provided
that
they
--
this
government
corporation
should
not
lose
their
separate
identity.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
know
when
the
smithsonian
institute
was
organized.
that
was
the
first
one.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
but
the
government
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
no,
sir.
it
was
not
to
answer
your
question
frankly.
it
was
not.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
and
they
weren't
even
contemplated.
so,
certainly
the
government
--
the
congress
could
not
to
have
contemplated
that
in
1878,
that
criminal
statute
would
cover
government
corporations
which
had
never
been
dreamed
of
in
that
day,
certainly
not
to
the
extent
that
they
employ
it
now.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
now,
within
a
--
not
--
not
only
this,
i
think,
congress
recognized
that
there's
a
--
that
is
a
separate
identity
to
a
government
corporation,
such
as
commodity
credit
corporation.
but
the
commodity
credit
corporation
recognizes
itself
in
the
false
--
in
the
assignment
of
claims
statute
which
is
found
in
title
31
section
203.
that
provides
that
no
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
shall
be
assigned
unless
it
is
--
the
assignment
is
witnessed
by
two
witnesses
unless
the
amount
of
the
claim
has
been
audited
and
approved
and
a
warrant
for
payment
issued.
but
commodity
credit
corporation
comes
along,
and
under
its
power
to
promulgate
its
own
rules
and
regulations,
as
they
all
have.
it
provides
under
its
whole
program
that
claims
against
commodity
credit
corporation
may
be
assigned
simply
by
going
to
--
by
having
the
assignment
witnessed
by
two
witnesses
or
executed
before
an
order
public,
just
hand
them
out.
but
that's
not
--
then
you
see
commodity
credit
corporation
then
recognized
this
that
it
is
a
separate
entity,
it's
in
a
different
position
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
because
it
doesn't
recognize
the
false
claims
act
of
the
--
under
which
the
united
states
and
its
government
agencies
--
and
its
agencies
must
employ.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
well,
your
honor,
i
--
evidently,
congress
thought
that
it
was
necessary
to
amend
it,
the
criminal
portion
of
the
statute
because
it
had
a
--
prosecutions
had
been
attempted
under
revised
statute
1500
--
5438
for
presenting
false
claims
against
government
corporations
and
they
had
been
unsuccessful.
the
courts
had
held
against
the
government.
and
that's
when
the
1918
that
came
along
and
amended
that
government
statute
after
5438
to
make
it
cover.
now,
yesterday,
in
the
discussion
in
this
companion
case
of
(inaudible),
whichever
it
--
is
was,
mr.
justice
black
asked
a
question
about
prosecution.
now,
this
--
this
commodity
credit
corporation
act
has
a
criminal
section.
it's
714
(m)
(a)
to
(d)
i
believe
inclusive
and
it
sets
up
its
own
penalty
provisions
and
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
penalty
for
the
presentation
of
a
false
claim
against
commodity
credit
corporation.
so,
in
drafting
the
commodity
credit
corporation
act,
they
did
not
intend
to
depend
on
prosecutions
under
the
false
claims
statute.
you
see,
the
5438
or
the
--
as
you
will,
section
35
of
the
criminal
code,
that
they
set
up
their
own
section
under
which
the
prosecution
should
be
instituted
for
presenting
a
false
claim
against
commodity
credit
corporation.
they
could
just
easily
have
said
that
--
if
they
have
wanted
to
avail
themselves
of
this
false
claims
statute,
the
provisions
of
it,
similarly,
they
could
have
written
that
into
the
act.
now,
they
hadn't
anything
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
yes.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
no,
your
--
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
think,
i
agree
with
my
friend
mr.
doub
yesterday,
when
he
said
that
the
--
that
commodity
credit
corporation
should
take
this
problem
up
with
congress
and
not
with
this
court
because
if
they
want
to
avail
themselves,
if
commodity
credit
corporation
wants
to
avail
itself
of
the
right
to
pursue
similarly
under
the
false
claims
statute,
it
ought
to
ask
congress
to
amend
the
law,
so
that
that
can
be
done.
now,
this
doesn't
preclude
commodity
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
mr.
chief
justice,
it
--
it
certainly
is
a
corporation.
it
--
the
act
says
that
it
shall
maintain
its
separate
identity.
the
congress
provided
that
it
should
be
audited
differently
from
a
simple
government
agency
and
it
was
organized
for
the
purpose
of
flexibility
and
--
and
so
that
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
responsible
to
the
government
for
so
many
different
matters
but
could
handle
them
much
more
easily
as
a
corporation.
and
it
could
if
it
was
an
agency
of
the
government.
now,
suit
isn't
precluded
by
a
--
by
--
i
mean
commodity
credit
corporation
has
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
own
name.
it
can
bring
a
suit
against
these
people.
it
has
that
right.
what
i
do
say,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it
cannot
bring
a
suit
against
these
people
under
revised
statutes
3490
because
3490
only
adopted
5438
and
that
was
done
at
a
time
when
5438,
which
is
a
criminal
statute
and
must
be
strictly
construed,
did
not
have
within
its
terms
a
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
stockholder.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
suppose,
your
honor.
that
was
meant
some
officer
of
the
government.
i
don't
know
what
limitation
that
might
be.
i
guess
it
--
would
be
probably
some
officer.
if
they
wanted
that
the
pleader
wanted
to
so
draw
it.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
possibly,
not
limits
it.
probably,
just
draws
it
down
a
little
bit
so
that
in
drawing
the
indictment
they
could
specifically
describe
the
department,
the
departments
are
lifted
in
title
5
of
the
code
and
that
was
probably
the
reason
for
doing
that.
i
suppose
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
think
it
means
--
i
don't
think
that
you
could
come
along
in
--
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation
act
and
it's
about
simply
calling
commodity
credit
corporation
an
agency,
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
reached
way
back
to
1878
and
amend
that
section.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
believe
that
would
have
been
sufficient,
your
honor
at
that
time
to
cover
and
would
have
covered
just
as
much
you
see
in
the
government
of
the
united
states,
or
a
department
or
officer
thereof.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
no,
sir.
because
this
court
has
held
the
simple
matter
of
a
corporation
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
government,
does
not
make
it
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
would
--
i
would
think
probably
the
statute
would
to
be
just
as
broad
if
it
had
simply
said
in
1878,
the
government
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
yes.
they
are
listed
in
title
5
and
ended
--
we
had
a
new
one
(inaudible)
--
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
it
--
it
might
by
the
mention
of
those
few
or
limit
--
i
mean
excluded
and
not
mentioned,
you
mean
sir?
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
i
--
i
would
think
this
about
it,
that
--
that
a
false
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
possibly
have
included
a
department
as
they
are
listed
in
title
5
of
it
and
--
and
an
officer
of
the
government.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
all
there
together.
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
means
a
separate
entity,
such
as
the
commodity
credit
corporation
or
any
other
government
corporation.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
leon
b.
catlett
thank
you,
your
honor.
