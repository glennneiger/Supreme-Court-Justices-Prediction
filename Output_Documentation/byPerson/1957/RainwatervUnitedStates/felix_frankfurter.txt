justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
it
--
the
view
of
this
general
principle
going
back
to
chief
justice
marshal,
the
fisher
case
that
you
can
get
light
from
any
source,
isn't
it
fair
for
those
of
us
who's
not
been
in
congress
to
assume
that
it
doesn't
do
idle
things?
maybe
that
isn't
a
fair
assumption
to
attribute
to
congress
that
i
was
brought
up
to
respect
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
noble
thought
by
these
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
noble
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
immunity
from
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
immunity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
know
what
immunity
from
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
is
that
a
word
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
what
immunity
means
in
connection
with
the
government
agency
except
the
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
unless
it
is
explicitly
conferred.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
what's
the
date
of
the
community
--
commodity
corporation
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
after
the
(inaudible)
case
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
which
we've
held
that
the
--
that
where
the
congress
says,
he
has
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
sovereign
immunity
isn't
given
to
corporations
unless
explicitly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
why
should
they
want
to
give
immunity
from
suit
to
this
corporation?
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
different
thing.
they
should
have
wanted
to
make
the
commodity
credit
corporation
so
favor
the
child.
justice
felix
frankfurter
department,
mr.
catlett.
the
word
“department”
isn't
that
a
term
of
ours
in
our
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i'm
asking,
isn't
the
word
“department”,
a
term
of
ours
--
in
our
--
in
our
scheme
of
government
or
in
our
public
law.
the
word
“department”
comes
form
the
constitution
and
it
means,
the
--
what
do
you
mean,
secretary
--
department
of
state,
department
of
agriculture?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
wasn't
dealing
with
justice
black's
question.
i'm
putting
one
of
my
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
i
don't
follow
that.
i'm
surprised
you
take
that
--
give
that
end.
you
think,
department
or
officer
adds
to
the
comprehensiveness
of
government?
if
it
does,
then
the
particularization
has
a
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
it
doesn't
add
enough
because
it
doesn't
take
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
actually
--
who
actually
authorizes
the
loans
or
the
advances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
determines
--
who
determines,
whether
he
will
purchase,
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
a
criminal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
criminal
statute,
which
is
incorporated
by
a
reference
for
repeal
by
congress,
could
you
bring
any
suit
for
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
isn't
the
criminal
statutes,
as
much
a
part
of
it,
as
thought
the
written
into
it,
before
it
was
bifurcated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
continues
to
live.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
mean
it's
withdrawn
from
the
operating
force
of
the
--
of
the
provision
which
makes
recovery
in
this
kind
of
a
suit,
dependent
upon
the
criminal
statute
as
a
necessary
part
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
still
matters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
wondering,
1926
which
is
the
first
codification,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that
carried
them
separately?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
1934
came
along,
have
we
got
anything
comparable
to
the
annotations
of
18
and
28,
or
30
or
--
that
is
the
--
the
present
one
was
it
--
was
that
in
title
31
then,
mr.
doub?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
with
the
chief
justice's
permission.
let
us
know
whether
anything
--
any
legislative
materials
--
i
don't
mean
debate,
whether
when
that
separation
was
made
in
the
1934
edition
of
the
code.
whether
anything
was
set
on
this
subject
or
whether
that
just
was
--
that
was
all
west
publishing
company
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
doub,
wasn't
it?
