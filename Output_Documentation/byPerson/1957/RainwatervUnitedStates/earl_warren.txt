mr.
catlett,
in
1863
when
this
act
was
original
passed
and
in
1878
when
it
was
divided
the
--
during
the
criminal
and
the
civil
jurisdiction,
was
the
government
functioning
in
any
manner
through
corporations
such
as
this,
in
which
it
had
stopped.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
pretty
minor
--
that's
a
pretty
minor
--
minor
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
catlett,
the
thing
that
i
have
in
mind,
when
i
asked
that
question
was
--
was
this.in
1863,
the
functions
of
government
were
quite
simple
compared
to
what
they
are
today.
i
--
i
wonder
if
every
time
the
government
changes
its
method
of
--
of
operating
and
assigns
functions
to
--
to
different
agencies
or
adjuncts
of
--
of
government,
if
it
would
be
required
that
the
--
an
act
of
this
kind
be
amended
when
obviously,
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
protect
the
government
against
any
false
claims
made
against
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
congress
sometimes
has
things
called
to
its
attention
that
the
--
that
impels
them
to
amend
a
certain
--
a
statute
because
of
particular
things,
you
said
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
here
because
prosecution
wasn't
successful.
but
can
we
--
can
we
charge
the
congress
with
the
responsibility
of
doing
it
in
every
other
situation
where
--
where
they
think
it
properly
is
adequate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
doesn't
that
assume
though
that
--
that
this
isn't
a
government
--
part
of
the
government.
it
isn't
a
department
of
the
government
and
that
therefore,
it
isn't
included
in
the
act
of
1863
or
1878.
now,
as
i
understood
mr.
doub
this
is
--
this
is
part
and
partial
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
that
therefore
it's
a
part
of
the
government
and
therefore
it
applies
in
--
in
the
case
of
credit
commodity
corporation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doub.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
should
think
he
--
never
mind.
i
don't
think
that
if
he'd
answer
him,
there's
anything
against
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
anything
in
that
regard,
you
may
submit
also,
mr.
catlett.
