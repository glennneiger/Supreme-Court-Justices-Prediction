mr.
george
cochran
doub
if
the
court,
please.
may
i
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question
form
the
standpoint
of
the
government?
we
think,
that
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
our
position
is
that
the
language
is
in
the
statute
by
using
the
words
“united
states”.
and
again,
using
the
term,
“government
of
the
united
states,
any
department
or
officer
thereof”
is
all
designed
to
make
manifest
(inaudible)
the
comprehensive
broad
coverage
of
the
act
and
that
word
“department”
was
not
a
word
of
limitation.
now,
before
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
i
do
think
it
adds
to
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
before
discussing
the
1918
amendment,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
just
a
few
things.
first,
as
to
the
fraudulent
claims
which
were
made
in
this
case.
there
are
two
separates
suits,
one
against
the
rainwater's
and
the
other
against
this
arkansas
bank.
now,
we
alleged
that
the
rainwater's
purchase
cotton
from
producers
and
at
later
dates,
they
arranged
for
the
sellers
to
sign
notes
and
loan
agreements
on
this
previously
sold
cotton
for
this
fraudulent
purpose.
and
that
purpose
was
to
put
themselves
in
a
position
to
--
if
the
market
continue
to
decline
and
the
price
of
cotton
to
make
this
fraudulent
loans
from
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
and
that
they
did
that
by
going
to
the
bank
which
they
control
and
where
officers
are
and
the
bank
had
full
knowledge
of
the
fraudulent
character
of
the
representations
contained
in
this
--
in
these
notes.
and
the
bank
sent
forward
those
notes
to
the
commodity
credit
corporation
and
obtained
the
payment
of
the
value
of
the
cotton
with
interest
and
the
cotton
went
up
as
collateral.
now,
the
fraud
was
that
the
rainwater's
and
the
bank,
both
had
full
knowledge
that
this
cotton
had
not
been
produced
by
the
persons
presenting
those
notes
as
was
required
under
the
terms
of
the
cotton
loan
act
and
the
notes
did
not
represent
any
advances
to
be
made
to
the
cotton
producers.
now,
the
commodity
accepted
those
notes
and
it
made
full
payment
on
the
notes
with
interest.
now,
subsequently,
the
price
of
cotton
went
up.
so,
what
happened
was
the
rainwater's
redeemed
the
collateral
for
the
notes
and
the
notes
repay
commodity
credit
and
the
notes
were
canceled.
so,
there
was
no
actual
loss
to
the
government
except
that
imputed
under
the
civil
clause
claims
act.
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
holding
that
these
transactions
were
false
claims
under
the
false
claims
act.
they
said
where
the
ultimate
source
of
payment
of
the
fraudulent
claims
with
the
federal
treasury,
there
can
be
no
distinction
between
a
government
corporation
or
the
government
itself
being
defrauded.
it
said
with
respect
to
its
funds,
commodity
and
the
government
are
indistinguishable.
and
finally,
it
said
that
even
though
no
specific
damages
were
proven,
the
government
was
still
entitled
to
its
forfeitures
under
the
act.
now,i
--
i
like
to
point
this
out
to
the
court,
the
corporate
veil
has
already
been
pierced
by
the
decision
of
this
court
and
others
as
to
holding
on
government
corporations.
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
separate
legal
identity
and
the
separate
legal
staffs
of
a
corporation,
immunizing
its
stockholder
from
liability
has
been
destroyed
already
in
the
case
of
holding
on
government
corporations.
under
cherry
cotton
mills
decision,
the
united
states,
the
sole
stockholder
and
parent
may
sue
in
its
own
name
upon
the
obligations
of
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
or
any
other
holding
on
government
corporation.
you
said
this,
that
the
congress
chose
to
call
it
a
corporation
does
not
alter
its
characteristics,
so
as
to
make
it
something
other
that
what
it
actually
is,
an
agency
selected
by
the
government
to
accomplish
purely
governmental
purposes.
and
then,
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims,
suits
maybe
brought
directly
by
the
united
states
upon
the
claims
of
its
wholly
owned
corporations.
it
--
one
case
illustrate
this
is
crooks
terminal
warehouse,
92
court
of
claims
which
is
not
on
our
brief,
solving
the
federal
surplus
commodities
corporation.
so,
what
is
left
then
--
what
is
left
then
of
the
corporate
section?
its
principal
components
no
longer
exist
in
the
case
of
wholly
owned
corporations.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it
has
no
--
officers
or
employees
independent
of
those
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
its
officers
and
employees
are
paid
by
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
on
the
department's
budget.
and
the
--
so,
all
the
personal
expense
of
the
salaries
of
all
the
employees
and
officers
are
included
in
the
appropriation
acts
for
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
policy
maker
--
makers
--
maker
rather
is
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
he
--
he
determines
the
policies
that
should
be
followed
to
fulfill
the
broad
congressional
objectives
and/or
crop
loans,
support,
price
support,
purchases.
and
then
he
uses
commodity
credit
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
payments
required
by
the
act.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
would
say
that
first,
you
have
the
secretary
making
an
announcement
of
the
price
of
which
he
is
going
to
boycott
for
example.
then,
he
will
state
in
his
announcements
to
that
policy
and
the
federal
register
that
would
be
made
through
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
now,
the
--
the
payments
are
made
by
check
of
the
commodity
credit
corporation
and
the
--
in
the
same
way
the
loan
payments
when
they
purchased
notes,
who
makes
the
notes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
as
i
said
yesterday,
our
first
contention
would
be,
a
much
broader
one
that
the
false
claims
act
should
be
applied
to
all
wholly
owned
government
corporations
(voice
overlap).
but
if
you
don't
accept
that
--
if
you
don't
accept
that.
then
we
say,
this
is
merely
a
shell,
this
is
merely
a
tool
of
the
department
of
agriculture
within
the
department
of
agriculture
or
without
any
independent
officers,
without
anyone
even
paid
or
any
loyalty
or
allegiance
to
the
alleged
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
at
least
up
until
recently
is
now
being
merged
into
the
treasury
department.
so,
you
have
somewhat
analogous
situation
now
but
up
until
a
year
ago
it
--
it
was
manned
and
officered
by
its
own
officers
and
employees
with
no
allegiance
to
any
other
department
at
all.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
that's
--
that
has
a
--
a
very
different
status
there.
i
think
they're
outside
stockholders.
i
--
i
want
to
discuss
these
hybrid
corporations
in
a
moment.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
for
--
for
--
on
your
first
point,
you'll
find
a
similar
criminal
statute
included
in
statutes
relating
to
a
number
of
the
agencies
of
the
united
states.
for
instance,
1010
applies
to
f.h.a.
frauds
but
those
aren't
criminal
statutes.
this
is
not
criminal
statute.
my
friends
on
the
other
side
talked
about
us
prosecuting
--
bringing
prosecutions
under
the
civil
false
claims
act.
they
are
not
prosecutions.
they
--
this
is
a
statute
authorizing
a
civil
recovery
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
for
losses
which
it
has
sustained.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
historically,
yes.
that
was
the
historical
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
deprivation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
--
but
that
--
that
is
--
may
i
suggest
this,
sir,
that
when
congress
provided
in
3490,
i
think
that's
it,
that
the
united
states
would
be
able
to
recover
its
losses
against
those
who
violated
this
criminal
statutes
or
this
other
statute,
i
mean
all
statute.
if
it
did
to
say
or
--
or
for
the
offenses
covered
by
it
are
--
we're
just
not
a
--
they
going
to
follow
the
idea
that
it
means
that
if
--
if
congress
passes
other
criminal
statutes,
making
other
things
fraud
or
even
though
there's
coverage
of
the
two,
even
though
there
are
broader
criminal
statutes.
we're
--
we're
not
--
we're
just
--cannot
accept
to
note
that
that
meant
that
the
false
claims
act
goes
out
of
the
window.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
civil
remedy
goes
out
to
the
window.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
doesn't
the
congress
follow
that
where
congress
has
not
repealed
the
statute.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
continues
to
live.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
let
me
address
myself
to
the
second
point
that
i
think,
has
been
emphasized
so
much
by
the
other
side.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
civil
there
--
there
no
civil
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
civil
penalties
at
all.
it's
entirely
penal,
entirely
criminal.
now,
if
they
had
provided
in
the
commodity
credit
corporation
act
for
a
civil
recovery
by
the
united
states,
of
course
we
couldn't
be
under
our
--
the
statutes.
i
--
we
would
agree
to
that.
now,
what
was
the
effect
of
this
1918
amendment
to
include
corporations
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
stockholder?
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
almost
the
entire
argument
of
the
defendant
setters
upon
that
amendment.
now,
you've
already
interpreted
that
amendment
authoritatively.
you
said
that
amendment
was
intended
to
protect
the
emergency
fleet
corporation,
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
sole
stockholder
and
that
was
a
pioneer,
a
government
corporation.
that
was
the
first
of
these
government
corporations
and
it
was
designed
to
purchase
and
operate
a
fleet
of
cargo
vessels.
in
competition
i
might
say
with
private
interest.
now,
at
the
time
that
corporation
was
created
and
at
the
time
that
statute
was
passed,
you
said
this,
congress
contemplated
a
corporation
in
which
private
persons
might
be
stockholders
and
which
was
to
be
formed
like
any
business
corporation
under
the
laws
of
the
district.
that
was
from
shipyards.
now,
the
point
is
not,
that
subsequently
the
united
states
became
the
sole
stockholder,
the
point
is
not,
that
this
court
suggested
in
united
states
against
walter
that
if
you
construed
that
statute
to
apply
the
corporations
in
which
the
united
states
had
a
mere
stock
interest,
it
might
be
unconstitutional.
the
point
is
what
was
the
congressional
purpose
of
the
statute?
what
was
contemplated
by
the
congress
in
passing
that
statute
because
the
whole
argument
here
relates
to
the
intention
of
congress.
so,
congress
manifested
an
intention
to
apply
that
criminal
statute
to
this
corporation
in
which
they
contemplated
--
there
would
be
outside
interest.
now,
the
language
of
the
amendment,
not
merely
supports
that,
it
says
any
corporation
in
which
united
states
is
a
stockholder.
it
doesn't
say
wholly
owned
government
corporations.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
--
no.
what
the
fleet
corporation
--
it
was
chartered
only
what
was
tantamount
to
local
law,
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
private
corporation
with
the
power
to
purchase
construction
and
operate
merchant
vessels.
the
shipping
board
act
of
1916
authorized
the
shipping
board
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
to
purchase
not
less
that
the
majority
of
the
stock
and
with
the
president's
approval,
it
could
sell
all
or
such
part
of
such
stock,
except
it
couldn't
be
left
is
a
minority
stockholder.
in
other
words,
this
corporation
was
organized
under
a
statutory
power
vested
in
the
shipping
board
to
create
corporations
and
they
were
designed
to
be
private
corporations
in
essence,
organized
under
local
law.
now,
you
were
in
that
call,
that
at
the
time
of
these
early
cases
construing
this
fleet
corporation
situation,
the
current
legal
thinking
was
that
there
was
major
distinction
between
proprietary
functions
of
the
government
and
governmental
functions.
and
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
that
when
congress
passed
this
1918
amendment
to
apply
to
any
corporation,
in
which
the
united
states
had
an
interest,
that
if
then
contemplated,
corporations
which
were
not
wholly
owned
by
the
united
states
and
to
illustrate
it
in
this
very
situation.
it
was
contemplated
at
that
time
that
it
would
be
only
partially
owned.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
it
was
directed
to
this
specific
corporation.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
they
are
all
employees
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
officers
and
employees.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
sir.
and
there
are
none
that
are
not
employees
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
i
know
of
none
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
view
of
the
--
what
has
been
said
about
the
--
i
don't
know
if
whether
i
brought
the
right
book
here
or
not.
i
did
want
to
refer
to
the
distinction
in
our
law
between
the
wholly
owned
government
corporations
and
the
hybrid
corporation.
you'll
find
it
in
the
--
in
the
government
corporation
control
act
of
1945
and
section
846
defines
wholly
owned
government
corporation.
it
says
it's
used
in
this
chapter
the
term
wholly
owned
government
corporation
means
the
commodity
credit
corporation
and
enumerates
innumerable
others.
and
then
later
on,
after
providing
how
their
budget
shall
be
handled
and
how
their
budget
should
be
approved
by
the
president
and
he
may
modify
and
amend,
has
been
cut
down.
it
then
provides
for
mix
ownership
government
corporations.
section
856
says,
it's
used
in
this
chapter
the
term
mixed
ownership
government
corporations
means,
one,
the
central
bank
for
cooperatives
and
the
regional
banks
for
cooperatives.
two,
federal
land
banks.
three,
federal
home
loan
banks
and
four,
federal
deposit
insurance
corporations,
now,
the
--
the
methods
of
auditing
are
very
different.
so,
there's
--
there's
a
clean
cut
distinction
which
congress
has
made
between
the
two.
now,
we're
not
contending
that
the
hybrid
corporation
is
covered
of
frauds
on
them
or
covered
by
the
false
claims
act
here,
but
we
are
claiming
that
the
wholly
owned
government
corporation
is
an
integral
part
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
it
would
not,
sir
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
has
to
be
wholly
owned.
it
has
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
and
when
you
reduce
it
down
to
that
point,
you
reach
the
point
where
there
is
nothing
left
of
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation
except
the
name
because
you've
already
just
pierced
the
corporate
veil,
you've
already
destroyed
the
--
the
major
legal
incidents
of
--
of
legal
status
and
legal
entity.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
me
yesterday,
when
the
false
claims
act
was
--
the
statutes
were
first
codified.
i
find
it,
sir
in
--
it
was
in
the
1934
code.
and
the
first
edition
of
the
code
in
1926
carries
the
statute
separately.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
sir?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
it's
the
first.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
carried
them
separately.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
so.
i'm
not
sure
though,
sir.
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
that
--
that
the
certain
titles
of
the
code
like
18
and
28
which
by
act
of
congress
became
a
positive
law,
that

that
wouldn't
apply
to
title
31.

is
merely

and
the

still
give

that's
what
we're
asking
for
here.
