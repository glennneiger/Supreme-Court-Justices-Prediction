so
you
hadn't
had
--
if
you
hadn't
had
any
amendment,
do
you
think
you
will
have
stronger
or
weaker
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wish
you
deal
with
the
two
--
two
points
that
the
opponents
make
and
that
you
don't
seem
to
excerpt
to
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
number
one,
the
fact
that
congress
went
in
and
enacted
the
commodity
corporation,
established
it,
provided
a
specific
criminal
penalty
in
that
act
which
would
indicate
to
me
that
they
didn't
consider
that
it
was
covered
in
the
federal
--
in
the
--
the
general
claims
act.
and
secondly,
when
they
came
to
amending
the
claims
act
itself,
they
--
i
haven't
heard
any
good
reasons
stated
yet
as
to
why
they
put
that
in
added
corporations
unless
it
was
that
they
didn't
consider,
that
they
were
already
covered.
now,
that's
my
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
has
the
vitality
--
it
has
vitality
only
because
there
is
a
criminal
statute
that
embraces
this
kind
of
deportations.
by
its
terms.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
written
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
written.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
there
other
corporations
in
existence
at
that
time?
government
corporations,
they
were
wholly
owned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
--
is
the
thrust
of
your
argument
that
if
the
emergency
fleet
corporation
had
been
set
up
as
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation,
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
to
amend
the
false
claims
act,
is
that
the
thrust
of
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
was
what
i
meant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
i
understood
this
--
i
understood
you
to
say
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
sole
occasion
for
this
enactment,
1918
enactment
was
this
circumstance
if
this
first
corporation
was
to
be
not
wholly
owned.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
it
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
you're
saying,
that
if
it
hadn't
been
for
that
problem,
there
been
no
occasion
for
the
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
a
51%
government
owned
corporation
be
covered
it
on
--
covered
on
your
theory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
not.
