mr.
richard
maguire
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
richard
maguire
--
may
it
please
--
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
direct
my
attention
first
to
the
first
of
three
lines
of
proof
which
the
government
say
are
in
the
case
which
support
the
conviction.
the
government
in
its
brief
argues
and
the
trial
judge
at
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
an
increase
in
net
worth
plus
a
negation
of
nontaxable
sources
is
sufficient
on
which
to
base
a
conviction.
i
say
that
clearly
under
the
holland
decision,
as
well
as
any
other
case
i
have
ever
read,
that
that
is
just
not
correct
law
and
i
have
recited
in
my
brief
from
the
opinion
of
judge
hand
in
the
costello
case
where
he
talks
about
just
what
this
court
meant
in
the
holland
decision
when
it
talked
about
the
negation
of
nontaxable
sources.
and
i
think
if
i
may
just
to
read
briefly
to
you
just
what
he
says
with
which
i
wholly
concur,
he
states
however,
it
is
not
that
it
does
not
follow
that
all
the
taxpayer
expended
was
necessarily
taxable
income
or
indeed
income
of
any
kind.
conceding
something
for
the
difficulty
of
establishing
by
impregnable
proof,
how
much
was
an
income?
the
court
is
satisfied
with
proof
of
a
likely
source
from
which
the
jury
could
reasonably
find
that
the
net
worth
increases
sprang.
through
a
likely
source
may
not
be
the
true
source
so
that
it
is
necessary
in
addition
to
exclude
the
possibility
that
what
he
received
did
not
come
from
gifts,
inheritances
or
loans.
now,
in
this
case,
the
only
evidence
that
was
introduced
as
to
a
likely
source
were
these
admissions,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
go
--
go
ahead
to
state
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
two
grounds,
one
of
relevance
and
one
of
lack
of
corroboration
that
these
admissions
should
not
have
been
received
and
therefore,
it
should
have
been
a
--
it
should
have
been
a
directed
verdict.
and
they
specifically
state
in
their
opinion
that
they
do
not
disagree
or
do
not
either
agree
or
disagree
with
the
adonis
decision
of
the
four
decisions.
in
other
words,
they
never
came
to
that
point,
but
that
is
the
first
line
of
proof
which
the
government
apparently
argues
and
as
i
say
as
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
that
simply
showing
the
bulge
plus
the
negation
of
nontaxable
sources
that
that's
sufficient
in
which
to
base
a
conviction.
mr.
richard
maguire
exactly.they
never
got
to
that
question.
the
second
argument
which
was
also
charged
by
the
trial
judge
is
the
fact
that
the
defendant
through
his
attorney
made
a
calculated
fabrication
such
as
we
find
in
the
adonis
case.
during
the
course
of
arguing
what
the
district
counsel
of
internal
revenue,
mr.
garrity
representing
the
taxpayer,
stated
that
in
the
year
1949,
his
client
received
a
sum
of
money
from
his
father's
estate,
cash.
mr.
(inaudible)
was
the
district
counsel
says
there
was
no
amount
mentioned.
he
says
it
was
x
dollars.
mr.
hirst
who
was
the
intelligence
agent
also
at
present,
his
testimony
was
that
no
sum
was
mentioned.
that
is
what
the
government
argues
and
the
district
court
charged
is
a
calculated
fabrication
such
as
we
find
in
the
adonis
case.
the
court
of
--
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“we
find
without
agreeing
or
disagreeing
with
the
adonis
decision
that
that
evidence
is
just
not
that
calculated
fabrication.”
so
that
we
don't
have
to
have
to
come
to
the
question
as
to
whether
we
agree
or
disagree
with
the
adonis
case
and
the
adonis
case
is
a
--
the
defendant
was
indicted
for
tax
evasion
in
the
year
1948.
the
increase
in
assets
was
sum
of
$38,000
which
was
represented
by
the
purchase
of
a
house.
and
it
seems
that
mr.
adonis
testified
in
a
judicial
proceeding
in
holland
in
the
year
1951
and
he
was
in
--
asked
as
to
the
source
of
the
same
$38,000.
and
he
gave
explanation
as
to
where
he
got
the
money,
getting
it
from
three
different
sources.
his
mother
gave
him
some,
the
government
at
the
tax
trial,
a
year
or
two
later
proved
beyond
any
question
that
the
mother
was
impoverished
and
a
very
elderly
lady
living
with
her
--
one
of
her
daughters.
secondly,
there
was
a
question
of
a
highly,
just
from
reading,
at
a
highly
fictitious
loan
and
to
sum
it
up
very
briefly,
they
completely
exploded
in
the
tax
trial.
mr.
adonis'
explanation
is
advanced
in
this
holland
judicial
proceeding.
the
court
in
the
third
circuit
held
that
that
calculated
fabrication
could
be
in
effect
a
substitute
for
the
likely
source
as
i
understand
it
is
demanded
by
the
holland
case.
now,
if
i
may
at
this
point,
go
back
to
what
i
understand,
this
court
meant
in
terms
of
the
decisions
prior
to
the
holland
case
and
the
holland
case
itself
as
to
what
was
meant
by
proof
of
a
likely
source.
that
was
done
under
the
cases
in
one
of
two
ways.
first,
you
show
that
the
taxpayer
was
in
an
income
producing
business,
witness
the
holland
case
where
he's
in
a
hotel
business,
the
johnson
case
where
the
taxpayer
owned
a
string
of
gambling
houses.
the
second
item
is
by
evidence
of
specific
items
of
undisclosed
income
and
two
illustrations
of
that
is
the
chapman
case,
all
of
these
are
cited
in
the
brief,
chapman
case
where
they
brought
in
witnesses
that
they
were
paying
the
defendant
over
this
in-cash,
over
the
ceiling
black
market
payments.
in
the
skidmore
case
where
the
--
where
they
were
paying
protection,
the
bookmakers
were
paying
protection
to
these
fellows
on
a
monthly
basis.
now,
we
filed
in
this
case
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulars
and
the
government
in
answer
to
our
bill
of
particulars
as
to
the
question
of
source,
specify
that
the
source
of
the
income
in
this
case
were
illegal
payments
received
by
the
defendant
in
the
course
of
his
duties
from
various
people
engaged
in
illegal
activities.
well,
as
far
as
were
concerned,
we
had
no
doubt
in
the
world
what
they
were
going
to
introduce
evidence
of
specific
payments
to
him
during
the
prosecution
years
of
graft
or
bribes,
whatever
you
call
it.
there
is
not
one
eye
order
of
evidence
in
the
case
of
anything
of
that
nature,
not
--
not
an
eye
order.
at
the
morning
of
the
trial
and
now
i'm
coming
to
the
question
to
these
admissions.
on
the
morning
of
the
trial,
we
learned
for
the
first
time
that
the
government
intends
to
prove
the
source
in
this
case
basically
through
admissions
of
the
taxpayer's
attorney.
now,
those
occurred
on
three
different
occasions.
in
the
course
of
the
investigation,
of
course
mr.
garrity
representing
the
taxpayer
was
in
constant
touch
with
mr.
hirst
who
was
the
intelligence
agent
and
you
will
find
from
reading
the
record
that
in
effect,
there's
no
dispute
about
the
assets
or
the
increases
in
assets
which
occurred
during
the
indictment
years.
in
fact,
all
of
that
information
was
furnished
to
the
government
by
mr.
garrity
acting
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer.
the
issue
was
always
that
mr.
--
that
--
the
--
the
defendant
had
this
money
in
his
possession
at
the
start
of
the
period.
mr.
garrity
pointed
out
that
he
was
on
the
vice
squad
on
three
different
occasions
prior
to
1945
which
is
the
starting
period
in
this
case.
he
was
on
it
for
some
10
months
back
in
1932.
he
was
on
it
for
a
year
and
eight
months
in
1938.
and
from
1940
to
1943,
some
three
years,
he
was
in
charge
of
the
vice
squad.
mr.
richard
maguire
this
is
mr.
garrity
in
talking
with
mr.
hirst
all
the
way
through
the
pre-investigation
your
honor.
mr.
richard
maguire
yes,
the
respondent's
counsel.
and
his
whole
approach
was
if
he
had
--
if
this
money
did
not
come
when
he
was
relegated
to
in
charging
of
peddler's
licenses
or
looking
after
the
physical
plant
as
a
police
officer.
it
came
--
if
it
came
at
all,
it
came
back
there.
now,
mr.
garrity
testified
on
the
stand
that
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
defendant's
activities.
that
never
concerned
him.
and
the
only
thing
that
was
--
concerned
him
is
the
defendant's
counsel
was
--
what
he
did,
did
he
get
any
graft
during
the
years
under
indictment?
in
any
event,
the
government
seeks
to
introduce
these
admissions
made
by
mr.
garrity
to
prove
likely
source.
at
the
trial,
they
were
objected
to
on
the
grounds
that
they're
irrelevant.
secondly,
they're
objected
to
in
the
grounds
of
materiality
that
--
secondly,
they're
objected
to
in
the
grounds
of
incompetence
that
whatever
knowledge
mr.
garrity
would
have
of
mr.
massei's
activities
would
obviously
come
to
him
by
a
reason
of
his
attorney-client
relationship
and
he
certainly
would
be
a
violation
of
that
to
disclose
it.
secondly,
that
there
was
no
proof
in
the
case
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
time
spent
on
this
in
the
record.
there
is
no
proof
at
all
in
the
case
that
mr.
garrity
was
authorized
to
make
these
admissions.
mr.
richard
maguire
there
is
one
instance
which
i'll
come
to
your
honor,
but
on
these
three
occasions
that
i
recite,
they
all
occur
in
the
years
1951
and
1952.
on
two
occasions,
the
admissions
were
testified
as
occurring
from
garrity
to
mr.
hirst
who
was
the
intelligence
agent,
just
the
two
of
them.
the
third
occasion
is
a
conference
with
mr.
isba,
the
district
counsel
and
mr.
hirst
where
mr.
garrity
is
endeavoring
to
convince
mr.
isba
that
the
government
did
not
have
a
case
and
that
it
should
not
be
recommended
for
prosecution.
and
he
in
effect
goes
into
this
conference
and
makes
a
lawyer's
argument
and
says
in
effect,
well,
look
at
this
man
--
have
this
money
of
the
--
he
didn't
get
it
during
the
indictment
years.
he
must
have
got
it
back
there
when
he
was
on
the
vice
squad.
mr.
richard
maguire
in
effect,
he
had
the
--
he
had
it
at
the
start
of
the
period,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
richard
maguire
well,
in
effect
of
course,
yes.
mr.
richard
maguire
the
taxpayer
did
not
take
the
stand,
your
honor.
they
only
witness
offered
by
the
--
by
the
defendant
was
the
attorney's
counsel
himself,
but
i
may
say
and
i
think
probably
i'm
understating
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
mr.
garrity
and
myself
who
was
trying
the
case,
it
came
to
us
as
a
distinct
shot
that
the
statements
made
or
an
argument
made
between
two
lawyers
and
trying
to
work
out
the
case
to
stop
the
prosecution
and
to
wind
it
up
severely.
we're
going
to
be
thrown
back
at
them
as
it
were
to
prove
this
case
against
this
client
and
what
are
the
amounts
to
if
your
honors
please
is
presently
--
if
these
admissions
in
effect
will
be
the
thing
that
are
going
to
send
mr.
massei
to
jail,
without
him
there
is
no
case.
mr.
richard
maguire
well,
i
think
if
your
honor
please,
we
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
we're
overboard,
but
we're
certainly
in
trouble
if
these
admissions
get
in.
mr.
richard
maguire
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
dependent.
i
think
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion,
they
simply
--
mr.
richard
maguire
well,
that
--
they
--
they
reached
the
decision
that
they
shouldn't
have
come
in
and
therefore
there
was
no
case.
mr.
richard
maguire
i
believe,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
so.
and
as
--
as
pointed
out
by
my
brother,
there
are
numerous
other
points
which
were
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
they
did
not
touch
on
and
one
of
them,
cheap
ones
was
this
question
of
the
competency
of
this
evidence.
mr.
richard
maguire
i
would
be
very
fearful
that
if
he
authorizes
it
for
a
limited
purpose,
he's
probably
in
trouble,
your
honor
at
a
later
date.
mr.
richard
maguire
exactly.
now,
on
the
question
of
relevance,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
richard
maguire
well,
i
certainly
don't
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
a
lawyer
has
got
the
right
in
effect
to
make
admissions
which
is
going
to
--
which
are
going
to
put
--s
mr.
richard
maguire
he's
got
the
right
to
manage
the
case.
now
incidentally,
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
case
as
to
the
contents
of
the
power
of
attorney.
it
is
--
mr.
richard
maguire
well,
i
--
i
think
to
some
extent,
your
honor.
we
have,
i
think,
two
other
very
substantial
grounds,
one
is
relevance
and
one
is
lack
of
corroboration,
but
on
that
question,
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
during
the
trial,
we
endeavor
to
bring
out
that
all
certain
hypothetical
statements
which
garrity
made
in
terms
of
arguing
his
case
to
isba.
and
at
the
early
stage
of
that,
that
was
all
excluded
by
the
trial
judge
as
being
not
important.
and
of
course,
what
we
were
trying
to
bring
out
was
that
garrity
in
effect
was
making
illegal
argument
here.
he
was
citing
cases,
for
instance,
this
one
specific
illustration.
i
asked
mr.
garrity
in
the
stand,
“well,
did
you
cite
some
cases
to
mr.
isba
on
this
question
of
source
and
showing
that
you
have
to
prove
a
likely
source
during
the
prosecution
period
that
was
excluded?”
later,
at
the
very
end
of
the
testimony,
he
did
allow
us
at
the
very
end
to
put
in
some
of
it
that
by
and
large
most
of
it
was
excluded.
mr.
richard
maguire
no.
there
is
no
testimony.
he
testified
to
that
himself
on
the
stand
in
the
case,
but
his
testimony
as
to
what
transpired
at
this
conference,
your
honor
is
simply
that
he
was
making
an
illegal
argument.
mr.
richard
maguire
he
testified
flatly
that
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
whatsoever
of
massei's
activities
in
the
pre-indictment
years.
on
the
question
of
lack
of
corroboration,
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case,
we
move
to
strike
all
these
evidence
if
not
having
been
corroborated
and
it
--
it
went
in
and
the
judge
charged
the
jury
that
you
can
find
corroboration
which
means
some
sort
of
independent
evidence
which
strengthens
your
belief
it's
true.
we
submit
on
this
that
there
is
no
--
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
corroboration.
the
government
argues
that
in
the
pre-indictment
years
or
they
start
them
off
with
an
opening
net
worth
of
$61,000
and
they
say
that
because
he
had
a
very
limited
salary
not
more
than
$3000
in
his
20,
almost
20
years
that
he
was
on
the
police
force
that
he
in
effect
couldn't
have
accumulated
this
money.
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
his
salary
as
a
municipal
employee
down
to
1939
was
exempt.
in
addition
to
that,
of
course
he
had
the
usual
$2000
exemption
which
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
his
living
standard
would
have
cost
him
to
live
according
to
the
government's
evidence
which
was
introduced
in
1945
was
$1300
so
that
we
have,
as
i
say
it,
he
could
have
very
well
during
that
period
have
saved
at
least
$2500
a
year.
furthermore,
let
--
let
me
if
i
may
come
to
this
question
of
relevance
and
i'm
not
going
to
dwell
on
it.
it's
covered
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
in
our
brief.
and
the
basic
proposition
is
simply
if
i
rob
a
man's
apple
tree
10
years
ago,
cannot
be
introduced
in
evidence
against
me
on
the
charge
that
i
robbed
this
man's
apple
tree
or
robbed
an
apple
tree
today.
and
i
say
under
the
cases
and
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
definitely
that
cannot
be
done.
i
think
in
conclusion,
if
i
may
please,
incidentally
in
terms
of
--
i
think
justice
black's
question.
as
i
see
it,
this
court
will
very
definitely
have
to
read
the
entire
record.
as
i
see
it
that
this
evidence
--
this
evidence
of
the
admissions
should
have
been
excluded
and
without
that,
i
say
there
is
absolutely
nothing
on
the
record
to
support
this
conviction
on
the
proof
of
a
likely
source.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
before
and
i'd
like
to
say
it
again
in
conclusion
of
the
court
below
never
reached
that
conclusion
and
they
say
and
i'll
read
if
i
may
--
well,
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
it,
but,
well
the
court
below
said
in
its
opinion
at
page
905,
“we
have
mentioned
the
adonis
case
above
and
the
second
circuit
ford
case
earlier
in
this
opinion.
we
do
not
mean
to
infer
that
we
either
approve
or
disapprove
of
the
exceptions
to
the
necessity
of
proving
likely
source
that
this
holding
seemed
to
have
established.”
mr.
richard
maguire
this,
i'm
reading
from
page
19
of
my
brief,
but
it
appears
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
at
page
905.
mr.
richard
maguire
i'm
referring
at
page
33
of
the
petition.
i'm
referring
to
the
decision
in
the
--
mr.
richard
maguire
in
the
federal
report.
mr.
richard
maguire
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
maguire
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
