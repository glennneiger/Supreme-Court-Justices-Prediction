justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
he
must
show
a
likely
source
of
untaxable
income?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
--
may
i
pursue
justice
black's
question,
are
you
then
saying
that
if
we
agree
with
the
abstract
proposition
which
you
just
made,
that's
all
we
have
to
do
as
a
matter
of
--
as
a
matter
of
reasons,
why
shouldn't
speak
in
the
back
(inaudible)
negative
other
likely
sources.
that
is
not
absolute
but
you
can
reach
the
same
result
by
its
proposition
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
we
have
to
decide
with
an
abstract
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
they
overstressed
and
over
weighed
the
reference
of
the
like
--
the
other
likely
source.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
sending
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
by
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
this
point
on,
do
you
suggest
that
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
unduly
read
the
significance
of
the
reference
in
the
holland
case
as
likely
source,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
aren't
you
doing
--
aren't
you
in
a
way
doing
what
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
have
done,
namely,
taking
that
thing,
that
strand
out
of
the
fabric
and
disregarding
the
general
cautionary
attitude
that
the
court
indicated
in
the
holland
case
for
this
method
and
therefore
he'd
wanted
to
put
something
that
it
recognized
as
in
theory
potentiality
to
the
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
it
takes
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
question
the
whole
--
it
says
the
whole
method
as
defined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
assuming
that
too
is
a
charge
of
--
lower
charge
to
be
unduly
favorable,
non-concept
of
defining
by
the
jury,
the
satisfaction
of
the
excessive
and
needlessly
favorable
charge
did
not
enter
into
the
jury's
verdict.
therefore,
the
--
the
case
should
be
held
to
the
way
in
which
it
was
left
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
plus
why
which
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
that
the
--
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
satisfy
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
satisfied
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
on
satisfying
it
if
they
left
the
right
theory,
if
they
left
a
need
of
--
of
satisfying
the
tax
thereby
and
that
should
not
have
been
put
to
the
jury
and
on
concept
they
would
have
filed
to
require
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
they
would
not.
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
find
a,
b,
c,
d
and
e.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
need
not
or
should
not
have
as
a
matter
of
correct
law
said
you
must
not
define
e,
but
he
didn't
do
that.
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
pursued
that
he
should
not
have
left
that
with
that.can
the
verdict
stand
because
the
(inaudible)
was
sufficient?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
if
the
jury
would
have
found
that
it
was
bad
and
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
maguire,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
assume
one
concludes
to
the
sanction,
assume
one
concludes
that
it's
a
fair
inference
that
the
client
authorize
mr.
garrity
to
make
the
statement
or
to
make
this
argument
off
of
this
hypothesis
with
the
view
to
presenting
or
persuading,
pressuring
people
not
to
recommend
the
prosecution
merely
for
that
purpose,
but
i
want
to
know
is
--
what
is
your
view?
can
a
client
restrict
his
lawyer
to
make
an
admission
for
a
limited
purpose
and
if
later
what
the
client
or
the
lawyer
said
to
that
limited
purpose
offered
in
a
criminal
case,
made
by
the
client
that
objects
his
introduction
as
exceeding,
as
breaking
the
relationship
because
the
relationship
is
allowed
to
be
made
public
only
to
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
question
really
is
whether
what
mr.
garrity
said
was
within
the
fair
scope
of
the
lawyer,
effectively
trying
to
represent
his
counsel
is
a
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
that
regard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
really
this
gets
down
to
a
judgment
of
what
was
an
invaluable
freedom
of
arguments
which
the
lawyers
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
905
in
federal
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
does
the
deliberate
fabrication
--
i
mean
the
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
evidence
about
anybody
which
will
justify
the
judges
characterizing
it
as
a
deliberate
fabrication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
missed
the
record,
the
government
agent
holding
mr.
garrity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
told
him
the
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
judge
said
--
that
hold
everything
about
it
except
that
the
lawyer
denied
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
deny
having
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
he
used
the
phrase
that
came
--
if
this
was
a
deliberate
fabrication,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
who
was
it
to
fabricate
it,
the
lawyer
or
the
client?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
have
to
read
what
judge
(inaudible)
