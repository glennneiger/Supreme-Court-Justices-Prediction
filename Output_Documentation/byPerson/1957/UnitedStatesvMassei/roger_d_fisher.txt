mr.
roger
d.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
tax
case
of
a
different
sort.
it
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
basic
issue
is
whether
federal
income
tax
evasion
is
proved
by
the
net
worth
method.
when
you're
doing
this,
it
is
indispensable
to
prove
a
likely
source
of
the
income
or
whether
guilt
may
be
established
by
other
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
held
that
proof
of
a
likely
source
of
a
net
worth
increases
was
indispensable
to
a
conviction
on
a
net
worth
method.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
court
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes.
the
courts
appeals
for
the
second
and
third
circuits
have
held
to
the
contrary
the
conflict
with
--
for
the
ford
case
in
the
second
circuit
was
dismissed
as
moot
when
mr.
ford
died.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
there's
still
conflict
on
the
law.
you
no
longer
have
two
cases
here
raising
the
point.
both
the
second
and
third
circuits
have
affirmed
convictions
in
which
there
was
not
proof
of
a
likely
source
and
stated
that
to
be
the
law,
the
first
circuit
has
reversed
the
conviction,
held
that
proof
or
likely
source
was
indispensable.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
the
respondent
was
indicted
in
1953
for
evading
income
taxes
for
the
five
years,
1946
through
1950.
during
this
time,
he
was
a
policeman
in
worcester
massachusetts.
the
voluminous
evidence
which
was
developed
over
a
12-day
trial
has
been
summarized
and
has
put
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.i'd
like
to
summarize
it
here
in
a
few
minutes.
respondent
was
a
member
of
the
worcester
police
department
from
1923
until
his
retirement
in
1951,
the
year
after
the
last
year
here
involved.
his
principal
duties
were
motorcycle
patrol
and
vice
squads
of
which
he
was
the
head
in
a
few
years
prior
to
1943.
during
two
of
the
indictment
years,
not
based
on
calendar
years,
but
during
the
period
of
about
two
years,
he
was
a
--
the
license
board
officer
who
handled
applications
for
licenses
for
taxi
cabs,
gas
stations
and
parking
lot
within
the
city
of
worcester.
during
three
years,
he
was
a
personnel
officer
whose
duties
were
those
of
an
inspector.
it
was
his
duty
to
see
that
other
officers
particularly
the
uniformed
officers
carried
out
their
duties,
their
assignments.
at
all
times,
prior
to
1945,
which
is
the
last
of
the
first
years
afore
which
we
are
here
--
which
we‘re
concerned,
his
salary
was
less
than
$3000.
during
the
indictment
years,
it
went
up
until
it
was
$4080
during
1950.
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
married
1933
did
not
work
and
had
no
income
and
at
no
time
had
any
gifts
or
inheritance
of
any
kind.
during
the
years
prior
to
1946,
the
respondent
and
his
wife
deposited
in
banks
and
spent
some
of
the
money
greatly
in
excess
of
their
reported
income.
at
the
end
of
1945,
he
and
his
wife
had
a
net
worth
of
at
least
$61,000.
during
the
indictment
years,
the
respondent
reported
income
bearing
from
$3200
to
$6000.
during
the
same
five
years
his
net
worth
as
was
established
by
proof
below,
increased
by
$88,000
to
a
total
of
$149,000.
this
--
there
was
evidence
dividing
up
these
increases
by
years
during
the
five-year
period.
funds
were
divided
among
nine
different
accounts
in
eight
different
savings
institutions.
and
both
prior
and
during
the
indictment
period,
he
purchased
and
paid
a
--
for
time
and
annuity
contracts
in
large
amounts,
each
policies
over
$25,000
--
each
of
three
policies
over
$25,000
all
purchased
in
cash.
and
throughout
the
indictment
of
five
years,
he
made
large
purchases
in
cash
continually.
there
were
half
a
dozen
or
more
of
over
a
thousand
dollars
each
in
cash
enlisted
some
of
them
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
our
basic
premise
is
that
circumstances
in
a
case
may
support
the
inference
that
increases
were
taxable
income
even
though
by
themselves,
they
might
not
support
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
a
particular
source.
we
think
the
court
--
no,
i
mean
a
divide
circumstantial
evidence
up
in
too
many
categories
which
each
of
which
must
be
proved
independently.
we
think
the
circumstance
here
is
highly
relevant
that
he
was
a
policeman
in
worcester
in
a
position
where
he
could
receive
grant
on
the
outside.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
we're
not
shifting
a
burden
in
that
--
i'll
probably
come
with
that
in
some
detail
your
honor.
this
is
like
a
complete
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
i
would
think
that
a
clerk
can
the
--
the
--
it
is
a
relevant
circumstance
in
a
net
worth
case
whether
a
man
was
a
policeman
on
the
vice
squad
or
whether
he
was
a
--
a
statistical
clerk
in
the
census
bureau
but
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
circumstance
which
should
be
considered,
i'm
afraid
in
the
case
--
i'm
not
withdrawing
any
conclusion
from
this
and
you
can
therefore
conclude
anything
at
all.
in
fact,
the
court
below
charged
the
jury.
they
could
--
there
was
a
presumption
that
he
did
not
take
any
bribes
during
that
period.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
the
court
charged
the
jury
below.
this
is
a
--
there
was
a
presumption
that
he
did
not
take
bribes
that
--
unless
they
found
evidence
that
he
did.
they
had
to
find
out
before
they
could
find
the
source,
but
we
think
that
the
--
it
is
a
circumstance
that
people
have
different
opportunities
for
outside
income.
one
more
item
on
the
fact
that
i
would
like
to
get
across
is
there
were
some
problems
of
admissions
here.
mr.
garrity,
a
lawyer
represented
the
respondent
during
the
investigation.
on
four
occasions,
once
in
the
presence
of
the
respondent
himself
and
three
other
times
with
agents,
he
told
the
investigating
officers
that
respondent
had
received
grant
while
he
was
on
the
vice
squad.
the
admissions
went
further.
one
of
them
stated
that
--
has
testified
too
later
that
respondent
was
the
number
one
man
responsible
for
gambling
supervision
in
worcester.
garrity
told
the
agents
that
respondent
had
accumulated
a
cash
hoard
through
graft
prior
to
1945.
and
during
the
investigation,
this
was
the
general
explanation
of
the
ending
resulting
net
worth
of
$149,000
at
the
end
that
he
had
all
these
in
a
cash
hoard
at
the
beginning.
he
explained
he
had
a
net
worth
in
the
beginning
about
$100,000
to
$110,000.
this
would
not
have
explained
the
entire
resulting
net
worth
and
mr.
garrity
stated
that
respondent
had
inherited
a
certain
sum
from
his
father,
an
unspecified
sum
who
quote,
“had
saved
a
lot
of
cash.”
the
respondent's
father
had
accumulated
a
large
sum
of
cash
with
reference
to
liquor
sales.
investigation
showed
that
respondent
had
not
inherited
any
cash
from
his
father
and
he
inherited
a
half
interest
in
the
house
in
which
he
was
then
living
and
that's
all.
investigation
also
indicated
he
did
not
have
a
cash
hoard
on-hand
at
the
beginning.
there
were
proofs
of
small
loans
against
his
passbook
that
was
cashing
in
some
government
funds
which
he
then
spent,
things
of
that
kind,
indicating
that
he
did
not
have
a
large
cash
hoard
on
hand.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
past
income
tax
returns,
there
were
no
income
tax
returns
during
the
period
when
the
municipal
officers
were
not
taxable
up
to
1939.
they
would
--
their
salary
was
not
taxable.
there
was
no
outside
income
reported
prior
to
1939.
from
1940
to
1945,
the
return
showed
his
salary
plus
some
interest
income
from
dividend
and
interest
on
the
various
accounts
which
were
known.
he
reported
all
those
accurately
as
far
as
investigation
could
tell.
on
the
stand,
mr.
garrity
testified
that
he
has
asked
the
respondent
if
he
had
any
nontaxable
receipts
during
the
five
years
and
that
respondent
had
told
him
of
nothing
except
a
half
interest
in
the
house.
the
jury
found
the
respondent
guilty
on
all
five
accounts.
he
was
sentenced
to
two
years,
$5000
fine
which
is
less
than
authorized
on
any
one
count.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
a
general
sentence
in
total.
it
was
not
--
not
--
the
sentence
was
not
by
counts,
a
gross
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction.
the
court's
theory
was
that
proof
of
a
likely
source
from
which
the
increase
of
the
net
worth
came
with
indispensable
element
in
the
proof
of
tax
evasion.
there
are
a
lot
of
prior
civil
case
of
their
own
which
the
suit
protects
efficiency.
the
court
found
that
the
admissions
of
garrity
and
the
admissions
of
the
respondent
himself
that
he
had
received
graft
that
a
discussion
--
conference
with
garrity
and
the
respondent
together
with
the
agent.
they
formed
a
corner
stone
of
the
government's
theory,
they
were
--
the
court
regard
this
as
crucial
and
that
they
had
to
be
corroborated.
they
then
found
that
there
was
no
independent
proof
of
source
and
found
that
therefore
there
was
lack
of
corroboration.
they
found
that
we
had
to
corroborate
--
we
have
to
give
evidence
which
would
corroborate
not
only
the
final
conclusion
but
the
--
pin
it
back
to
the
source.
the
court
also
said
that
the
admissions
of
graft
in
prior
years
would
not
have
been
relevant
and
this
was
not
the
main
ground
but
it
is
covered
by
their
opinion
that
he
could
not
introduce
evidence
of
one
crime
to
prove
another
because
a
man
sinned
once,
he
couldn't
presume
he
would
sin
again
and
that
should
have
been
excluded
on
that
ground.
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
evidence
as
to
the
admissions
was
struck,
there
was
no
proof
of
a
likely
source.
and
therefore,
a
directed
verdict
should
have
been
entered
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
because
of
the
conflict
in
circuits,
the
government
petitioned
for
certiorari
which
this
court
granted.
the
issues
of
those,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
conviction
in
this
case
and
any
of
the
five
counts,
with
particular
regard
of
it,
proof
of
source.
there's
a
subsidiary
question
as
to
whether
the
admissions
that
respondent
took
graft
were,
(a)
corroborative
and
(b)
relevant.
the
case
turns
on
the
construction
and
application
to
this
court's
opinion
in
holland
against
the
united
states
on
which
both
sides
consider
controlling.
i
think
i
can
narrow
the
question
from
respondent's
brief.
he
agreed
that
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
proof
of
a
likely
source.
if
you
turn
to
page
18
of
his
brief
which
i
invite
your
attention,
he
listed
what
he
considers
the
five
elements
where
--
in
which
the
government
must
sustain
the
burden
of
proof.
he
attempt
to
evade
tax
that
the
attempt
was
willful,
that
there
was
an
additional
tax
owing
that
--
to
establish
a
starting
point
with
reasonable
certainty.
the
fifth
he
lists
is
the
government
must
introduce
evidence
to
the
likely
source
to
account
for
the
increases
in
net
worth.
he
then
states,
“this
case
resolves
itself
another
question
of
whether
the
government
satisfied
its
burden
of
proving
the
essential
element
of
a
likely
source.”
we
regard
this
as
an
agreement
with
us
that
the
--
there
has
been
proof
that
the
attempt
was
willful,
adequate
proof,
that
there
is
an
additional
owing,
we
tried
to
evade
it
and
we've
established
the
starting
point
and
that
unless
proof
of
the
likely
source
is
indispensable,
the
crime
has
already
been
made
up.
the
--
the
--
i'm
turning
to
page
20.
the
first
point
of
his
argument
states
that
the
government
investigation
showed
the
respondent
received
no
nontaxable
receipts.
and
the
--
the
heading
of
his
argument
that
evidence
proving
no
nontaxable
receipts
does
not
support
the
inference
that
increases
in
net
worth
must
be
attributable
to
unreported
taxable
income.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
it's
in
their
opinion
which
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it's
in
the
petition.
it's
printed
--
it
quoted
--
on
page
24
of
our
petition,
they
said
recently
in
reviewing
a
civil
tax
deficiency
case,
we
interpret
the
above
language
from
the
holland
case
as
meaning
that
proof
of
a
likely
source
is,
“an
indispensable
element
for
the
net
worth
method
in
any
of
its
applications.”
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
they
held
--
when
they
had
stricken
all
the
admissions
of
respondent
as
to
graft
in
prior
years
as
being
uncorroborated
and
also
on
the
second
ground
that
it
was
evidence
of
one
crime
to
prove
another
are
not
relevant,
not
properly
admissible.
when
the
evidence
had
been
struck,
there
would
have
been
no
evidence
as
to
source.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
to
see
if
they're
right
on
what,
your
honor?
i
fail
to
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
without
that
evidence,
there
was
not
enough
to
prove
an
--
to
independently
prove
a
likely
source
and
the
only
other
evidence
there
was
in
there
beside
from
the
admission
of
respondent
or
the
discussion
of
the
respondent
himself
in
revision
through
his
attorney
was
that
he
was
a
police
of
--
as
the
source
say
he
was
a
policeman
of
increasing
responsibilities,
a
long
period
in
the
vice
squad,
a
long
period
on
--
on
the
motorcycle
patrol
on
the
main
street
of
worcester.
and
that
he
dealt
in
cash
in
large
amounts
of
--
of
--
not
large
bills
but
--
of
large
amount
of
small
bills
and
cash
transactions.
and
aside
from
that,
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
source
where
he
got
this
cash
from.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
and
you
don't
have
to
--
i
--
i'll
give
you
that
and
i
have
to
look
for
the
record
for
the
--
more
than
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
if
you
read
the
opinion,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
i
believe
they
--
the
court
--
the
court
below
in
--
before
it
treated
the
evidence,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“proof
of
a
likely
source
is
an
indispensable
element."
and
they
then
said,
“since
that
this
is
the
corner
stone
of
the
government's
case,
it
must
be
corroborated,
it
cannot
be
proved
by
admissions
of
prior
crimes
which
are
prejudicial.
strike
that.”
then
there's
no
proof
of
likely
source.
now,
our
theory
here
is
there's
enough
proof
in
this
case
taken
what
we
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
of
--
that
the
income
was
taxable,
that
the
income
was
taxable
that
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
government
does
not
have
to
prove
that
an
in
dispense
--
as
a
separate
element
and
a
circumstantial
evidence,
a
likely
source.
we
believe
that
--
that
in
the
holland
case
which
i'd
like
to
turn.
to
the
court
it
was
very
clear
in
length
considering
what
were
indispensable
and
what
were
requisite
and
what
--
or
other
points
that
should
be
born
in
mind.
now,
they
said
that
--
this
is
in
348
u.s.
three
years
ago
and
the
court
had
the
holland
case
and
a
group
of
net
worth
cases.
the
court
stated,
“we
agree
with
petitioner's
essential
condition,”
in
cases
of
this
type
with
the
establishment
with
reasonable
certainty
of
an
opening
net
worth.
there's
no
question
here
about
the
net
worth
and
under
two
headings
later,
they
say,
“also
requisite
to
the
use
of
the
net
worth
method
is
evidence
supporting
the
inference.”
that
is
evidence
supporting
the
inference
that
the
defendant's
net
worth
increases
are
attributable
to
currently
taxable
income.
the
--
in
that
case,
there
were
--
the
petitioners
claim
that
the
government
failed
to
adduce
adequate
proof,
have
been
negative,
all
possible
nontaxable
sources.
the
government
said
to
--
the
court
said
to
require
the
government
in
every
case
to
negative
all
possible
sources
of
being
insuperable
burden
and
about
proof,
increases
in
net
worth
standing
alone
cannot
be
assumed
to
be
attributable
to
currently
taxable
income,
proof
of
a
likely
source
from
which
the
jury
could
reasonably
find
net
worth
increases
sprang
is
sufficient.
now,
we
read
that
opinion
as
not
saying,
proof
of
a
likely
source
is
indispensable,
but
that
in
that
case
where
the
government
had
failed
to
disapprove
or
failed
to
adduce
much
proof
rebutting
nontaxable
sources,
but
they
did
not
have
to
in
the
absence
of
relevant
leads
by
the
petitioners
there,
but
could
introduce
evidence
of
a
likely
source.
now,
we
--
we
think
that
the
--
that
other
evidence
maybe
equally
or
more
persuasive
that
in
a
circumstantial
evidence
case,
it
is
be
a
poor
idea
to
put
proof
of
a
likely
source
as
a
separate
structure
toward
which
evidence
must
be
given.
since
inherently,
if
you
could
prove
the
source
itself,
it
wouldn't
be
a
net
worth
case.
so,
you
don't
have
to
prove
the
source
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
no
one
has
suggested
that.
petitioners
--
the
respondents
here
suggest
that
the
government
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
source
is
like,
but
we
think
that
a
possible
source
is
not
the
most
persuasive
evidence
that
there
can
be
adduced
but
other
circumstances,
may
be
equally
or
more
persuasive.
mr.
roger

and
--
mr.
roger

at
the
abstract

fails
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
that.
we
have
then
--
our
--
our

mr.
roger

i
think
that
the
least
you
have
to
do.
i
think
that
we
would
also
like
you
to
comment
on
the
admissibility
of
these
admissions
because
--
mr.
roger

that's
the
remedy
we
asked
for
there
are
other
questions
in
this

such
as
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
in
the
series
of
other
points
which
the
court

--
mr.

--
did
not
reach.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
they
--
they
vindicated
themselves
that
the
evidence
as
to
the
increases
in
net
worth
and
as
the
opening
net
worth
were
beyond
question.
respondent
conceives
in
his
brief
i
believe
or
maybe
it's
not
a
concession,
but
certainly
indicates
he
does
not
challenge
the
--
our
negative
proof
of
nontaxable
sources.
the
--
i'd
like
to
--
to
go
on
that
in
a
--
in
a
moment.
the
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
before
we
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
the
--
the
holland
case
did
pick
up
two
elements
which
must
be
proven
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
they
--
there
large
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
it
--
it's
--
it's
a
doubtful
method.
it
has
doubts
in
it.
inherently,
it's
a
circumstantial
evidence
method.
the
--
the
court
in
the
holland
case
did
say
you
must
have
independent
evidence
proving
the
opening
net
worth.
you
must
have
evidence
to
support
the
inference
that
the
gains
were
taxable
and
went
on
to
say
that
if
ever
the
government
failed
to
investigate
leads
which
are
reasonably
capable
of
being
checked,
the
court
could
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
this
is
a
burden
on
united
states,
whenever
a
--
a
taxpayer,
he
could
stay
solid
and
make
us
prove
the
case,
but
he
have
the
additional
tabs
that
he
can
--
that
if
there
--
an
innocent
taxpayer,
he
can
suggest
sources
and
we
--
if
they
were
reasonably
capable
that
the
ones
that
--
are
possible
of
being
checked,
the
government
has
a
burden
of
going
out
with
two
doors
and
soon
trying
to
check.
now,
that
--
those
are
cautionary
rules
the
court
laid
down.
in
addition
as
your
honor
points
out,
the
court
indicated
general
caution.
we
--
we
--
i
don't
think
i'm
doing
what
was
criticized
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
doing.
i'm
saying
consider
whether
the
evidence
that
went
to
the
jury
was
sufficient
for
an
inference
that
the
gains
were
taxable
and
you
should
not
divide
up
the
kinds
of
inferences.
i
think
the
evidence
that
he
was
a
policeman
and
not
a
statistical
clerk
is
relevant
even
though
you
cannot
by
itself
it
wouldn't
mean
a
thing.
i
think
the
evidence
--
he
was
the
head
of
a
vice
squad
while
gambling
was
in
worcester.
it's
relevant,
but
not
by
itself
not
enough.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
we
read
it
--
i
read
it
that
way
that
there
--
that
they
--
the
--
as
to
our
rebuttal
of
nontaxable
sources
and
as
to
our
proof
of
the
--
they
--
they
specifically
stated
that
the
net
worth
opening
was
established,
that
the
increases
were
established.
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
touch
on
the
--
before
--
before
i
touch
on
the
evidence
here
of
non
--
non-taxability,
i'd
like
to
just
point
one
further
consideration
why
we
think
that
source
should
not
be
picked
up
as
the
touchstone
of
a
critical
point.
it
is
not
what
determines
taxability.
if
we
had
proven
the
source
of
these
funds
to
be
john
smith,
we
do
not
know
whether
they're
taxable
or
nontaxable.
it
was
a
gift
or
a
bribe.
if
we
have
proved
these
funds
to
come
from
the
jones
corporation
that
he
wasn't
interested
in,
we
wouldn't
prove
it
was
a
withdrawal
of
capital
or
whether
it
was
income.
source
is
relevant.
proof
of
source
makes
it
easier
for
a
jury
to
--
to
appreciate
the
facts
and
be
--
be
satisfied
that
it
was
taxable,
but
proof
of
source
is
not
the
crime.
the
statute
doesn't
indicate
source
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
if
it's
taxable,
it
makes
no
difference
from
what
source
it
came.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
now
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
trial
--
the
trial
court
did
charge
the
proof
of
likely
source.
we
think
this
charge
was
unduly
favorable
to
the
respondent.
on
the
--
we
believe
that
as
respondent
recognized
in
his
brief
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
respectfully,
i
submit
not.
i
think
that
if
we
adequately
--
if
they
were
specifically
charged
on
a
number
of
items,
they
must
find
this,
they
must
find
that,
they
must
find
that.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
plus
why
which
we
think
it's
not
necessary.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
think
if
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
oh,
the
record
that
went
to
the
jury
satisfied
why.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
there's
--
there
was
no
question
that
the
record
that
went
to
the
jury
satisfied
why.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
evidence
before
the
jury
should
not
have
been
considered.
the
evidence
was
that
--
that
you've
testify
as
a
lawyer
and
permitted
that
he
was
for
a
while
just
before
the
period,
he
was
head
of
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
gambling
and
not
--
and
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
well,
i
--
i'll
leave
that
to
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
if
i
may.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
they
would
not
have
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
if
the
jury
found
the
fact
that
was
not
necessary.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
would
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
unless
e
were
--
were
deemed
highly
prejudicial
as
--
as
--
that's
why
i
asked
you
to
pass
on
the
point
if
this
evidence
was
relevant
and
was
not
inadmissible.
the
--
here,
we
did
not
have
a
mere
failure.
the
evidence
of
none
--
that
he
did
not
have
nontaxable
receipts.
it
was
not
a
mere
diligence
search
and
failure
to
find,
we'd
had
that.
but
we
had
here
a
binding
admission
considerably
finding
that
his
wife
had
no
gifts,
inheritance
or
nontaxable
receipts,
evidence
that
the
receipts
were
spread
out
evenly
over
long
number
of
years
which
is
not
the
way
he
received
inheritances
or
other
nontaxable
gifts
or
even
to
--
to
usually
borrow
money
at
that
kind
with
the
funds
he
had.
testimony
of
his
lawyer
that
he
had
asked
the
respondent
of
any
other
nontaxable
receipts
and
has
responded
and
only
told
him
of
the
half
interest
in
the
house,
not
in
controversy.
the
statement
of
his
lawyer
representing
has
found
to
be
authorized
that
all
the
funds
had
been
on
hand
at
the
beginning
of
the
period.
now,
we
think
that
contains
not
only
an
assertion
that
there
were
no
taxable
funds
during
the
period,
but
an
admission
that
there
were
no
nontaxable
funds.
the
evidence
of
concealment,
denying
bank
accounts,
cash
story
and
the
false
story
of
his
father's
inheritance.
we
believe
that
this
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
the
inference
taken
together
that
the
increases,
absolutely
proven
increases
unexplained
in
his
net
worth
proof
of
taxable
sources.
i'll
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
unexplained.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
oh,
during
the
investigation,
he
said
he
inherit
--
that
there
is
an
unexplained
$40,000.
there's
about
$100,000
at
the
beginning.
there
was
$40,000
unexplained.
he
say
inherited
--
unstated
amount
from
his
father
who
had
a
lot
of
cash
and
has
saved
up
a
lot
of
cash.
that
story
was
disapproved.
he
inherited
nothing
from
his
father
in
a
way
of
cash,
the
half
interest
in
the
house
in
which
he
was
living
is
all
he
inherited.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
in
a
few
second,
i'd
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
if
i
could
justice
frankfurter.
the
jury
was
charged
in
the
alternative
that
they
had
to
find
likely
source
for
most
years
or
for
those
years
after
his
father
died
that
if
they
found
that
the
story
was
false
and
it
was
a
delivered
fabrication
intended
to
convey
a
material
evasion
of
where
his
funds
were,
the
story
inherited
money
from
his
father
who
have
a
lot
of
cash.
if
they
found
that
false,
then
for
that
year,
they
could
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
in
the
adonis
case
which
was
--
which
this
district
judge
used.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
yes,
there
--
the
lawyer
stated
that
--
that
in
--
when
asked
to
explain
where
the
money
had
come
from,
the
testimony
was
--
i'm
not
saying
mr.
garrity's
testimony,
the
testimony
of
the
agents
who
heard
it
was
that
he
said
that
his
--
he
inherited
money
from
his
father
who
had
lot
of
cash
saved
up
or
who
had
a
lot
of
money
saved
up
in
the
liquor
business
and
this
would
have
explained
if
the
opening
net
worth
of
$110,000
which
is
suggested,
this
might
have
explained
the
balance.
it
was
found
that
he
received
not
one
cent
from
his
father's
estate.
the
executor
knew
of
no
asset
that
he
received
other
than
the
half
interest
in
the
house.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
lawyer
admitted
he
have
said
everything
came
before.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
lawyer
testified
that
his
position
was
that
most
everything
he
had
had
come
before
and
this
was
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
no.
he
suggests
that
when
he
said
this,
there
was
a
hypothesis
-
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
--
he
was
developing.
the
judge
charged
the
jury
that
they
must
find
that
these
statements
were
not
made
in
order
to
make
any
representative
at
all.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
i
believe
that's
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
lawyer
being
authorized
by
the
client
to
--
to
make
the
statement.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
the
--
there
was
--
about
half
of
the
trial
was
devoted
to
authorization
of
these
points.
the
evidence
was
that
mr.
garrity's
whole
course
of
conduct
was
to
not
to
let
the
agent
see
respondent
but
to
have
factual
matters
conveyed
through
him.
he
admits
and
counsel
concedes
that
every
time
in
the
repeated
letters
which
he
stated
--
which
mr.
garrity
stated
something,
garrity
--
that
is
a
binding
admission
authorized
by
the
lawyer
if
it's
in
writing.
the
judge
asked
garrity
on
the
stand.
if
he
would
have
spoken
to
the
agent,
if
he
had
not
been
authorized
to
speak
orally
as
well
as
in
writing
and
he
said
you
--
that's
a
fair
assumption
that
i
was
authorized
to
speak,
there
was
testimony,
powers
of
attorney.
it
was
admitted
that
a
power
of
attorney
--
if
it's
undoubted
testimony,
the
power
--
general
power
of
attorney
that
it
had
--
a
power
of
attorney
of
undefined
terms
have
been
filed
and
garrity
testified
to
these
bribe
takings
in
the
presence
of
respondent
that
he
had
received
grant
during
prohibition
error
by
charging
every
truck
that
rolled
out
(inaudible)
and
so
much
of
each
truck.
this
was
made
in
the
presence
of
the
respondent.
this
issue
was
first
passed
on
a
100-page
of
the
record
of
(inaudible).
the
judge
found
and
authorized
and
he
then
decided
to
protect
the
respondent
and
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
charged
and
they
must
find
it
authorized.
the
jury
found
it
authorized
--
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
showing
--
the
relevancy
of
that
is
it
showed
that
respondent
authorized
garrity
to
make
statements
about
his
prior
receipts
prior
to
the
opening
net
worth.
that's
--
that's
why
it's
definitely
a
question
of
authority.
mr.
roger
d.
fisher
that
was
the
general
contention.
there
was
no
ever
any
contention
that
any
nontaxable
receipts
came
into
the
--
the
estate.
if
i
may
answer
one
question
of
justice
black,
your
honor,
the
--
you
asked,
if
you
would
find
the
admissions
admissible,
we
think
they
are
of
course.i
f
you
find
them
admissible,
what
would
you
do
with
case?
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
on
--
this
is
on
page
32
of
our
petition
where
the
section
of
the
opinion
is
printed.
concluded
--
they
said,
“the
government
had
to
present
some
evidence
of
actual
graft
taking
or
opportunity
for
such
in
order
to
establish
the
element
of
likely
source.
since
it
failed
to
do
this,
the
district
court
should
have
stricken
the
evidence
concerning
the
admissions
in
the
record.
so,
under
the
test
as
they
construed
to
the
holland
case
as
requiring
proof
of
the
likely
source
is
indispensable.
they
also
construed
that
as
requiring
directed
evidence
of
taking
money
from
that
source.
so,
under
their
view,
our
case
would
not
be
sufficient
even
with
the
admissions
and
under
their
standard
if
they
construed
the
case.
