when
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
there
has
to
be
such
proof
presented
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
opinion
is
in
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
held
that
was
not
indispensable,
that
was
not
any
proof
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
were
right
in
that
in
which
--
the
only
way
we
could
reverse
them
would
be
to
redirect.
they
were
right
on
those
principles
of
law.
we
have
to
redirect
it
to
see
if
they
were
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
they
said
without
that
evidence
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
wondering
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
perhaps
to
read.
i'm
just
wondering
if
you
think
we
have
to
reach
that
point
where
we
would
review
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
a
likely
source?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
do
not
have
to
show
--
the
government
doesn't
have
to
show
that
it
was
a
likely
source?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
pointed
that
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
court
would
--
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
solely
they
were
inadmissible,
what
in
your
judgment
could
be
required
about
this
(inaudible)
assuming
at
that
point
it
decided
against
you.
i
want
to
find
this
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
asked
was,
i
want
to
know
if
(inaudible)
if
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
the
lack
of
sufficient
evidence
was
dependent
on
its
holding
in
that
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
crucial
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
if
--
if
they
were
wrong
on
that
rejecting
the
evidence,
i
assume
the
case
was
in
fact
they
have
to
go
back
to
them
for
consideration
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
that
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
--
what
was
the
evidence
of
authorization
to
make
that
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
relevancy
of
that
to
what
had
occurred
in
prohibition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
take
the
money
out
of
hand
(inaudible).
