well,
mr.
stull,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
actually,
does
this
congressional
history
show
much
more
than
that
congress
wanted
to
provide
a
forum
for
a
review
where
nothing
at
all
was
paid
by
the
tax
court?

how

how
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
do
you
spread
--
expand
that
into
a
prohibition
against
suing
for
a
refund
the
part
where
he's
paid
(inaudible)
i
rather
read
this
as
saying
that
congress
thought
that
many
taxpayers
faced
with
the
deficiency
assessment
help
us
to
pay
anything
at
all
(inaudible)
of
form
which
they
could
test
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
division.
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
this
which
says
that
where
they
paid
part
they're
not
still
--
that's
not
still
available
to
the
district
court
if
they
want
to
sue
for
recovery
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
talking
about
the
reason.
where
is
that
anything
in
this
that
you
referred
us
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
hardships
that
they're
talking
about
is
that
anything
at
all
should
have
to
be
paid
on
deficiency
before
testing
the
validity
of
the
deficiency.
