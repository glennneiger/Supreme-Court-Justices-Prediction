mr.
john
n.
stull
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
from
the
merits
of
this
controversy,
there
was
one
single
issue
whether
losses
incurred
in
commodity
transactions
where
deductible
in
full
as
ordinary
losses
as
a
taxpayer
contends
or
deductible
as
limited
to
capital
losses
as
the
government
contends.
as
a
result
of
the
disagreement
and
inability
to
get
together
in
the
administrative
procedures,
a
single
--
single
unified
deficiency
was
determined
by
the
commissioner
of
$27,000.of
this
amount
of
that
$5000
was
paid,
claim
for
refund
was
filed
and
rejected
and
suit
was
brought.
the
district
court
decided
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
because
the
entire
amount
of
the
tax
claimed
to
be
due
had
not
been
paid.
but
because
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
pass
on
that
jurisdictional
problem,
it
went
ahead
on
the
merits
and
held
for
the
government
and
the
merits.
the
tenth
circuit
never
got
to
the
merits,
we
just
affirmed
on
the
jurisdictional
point.
so
that
point
is
not
before
this
court.
the
question
is
whether
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
where
only
part
of
the
asserted
deficiency
is
paid.
now
we
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
admittedly
had
not
absolutely
passed
on
this
problem
but
we
think
the
guideposts
are
there
and
under
the
whole
statutory
scheme
for
the
collection
of
taxes
that
it's
obvious
that
congress
never
intended
to
allow
a
suit
to
be
brought
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims
unless
the
complete
amount,
the
entire
amount
claimed
has
been
paid.
section
1346
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
and
section
7422
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
contained
very
much
the
--
contained
the
same
language.
they
say
no
suit
--
well
7422
(a)
says,
“no
suit
or
proceeding
shall
be
maintained
at
any
court
for
the
recovery
of
any
internal
revenue
tax
alleged
to
have
been
erroneously
assessed
or
collected
without
bringing
a
suit
for
refund
first,
the
claim
--
filing
a
claim
for
refund
first.”
now,
essentially
that
same
language
was
in
the
civil
war
taxing
act
of
1866.
that
act
says
that,
“no
suit
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court
for
the
recovery
of
any
tax
alleged
to
have
been
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
or
collected.”
that's
pretty
close
to
7422
(a)
with
which
we're
concerned
here.
this
court
in
the
cheatham
case
in
1875
which
concerned
a
question
of
limitations.
discussed
the
question
of
whether
the
sovereign
had
to
make
very
strict
rules
for
the
collection
of
its
taxes
and
they
pointed
out
that
if
the
government
has
to
take
strict
measures
for
the
orderly
and
prompt
collection
of
its
taxes
and
they
said
in
that
connection
that
the
general
government
has
made
payments
of
the
tax
claimed
a
condition
precedent
to
resort
to
the
courts
by
the
party
against
whom
the
tax
is
assessed.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
well
honor
--
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
short
answer
to
it
is
that
congress
never
provided
for
this
particular
procedure.
but
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
distraint
is
a
last
resort.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
is
true.
we
can
distrain
but
we
think
that
distraint
is
the
last
resort
in
any
of
this
cases
that
for
example,
if
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
we're
wrong
in
this
case,
then
instead
of
the
two
methods
for
predetermining
deficiencies
asserted
by
the
government,
there
will
be
three.
there
will
be
a
hybrid
method,
part
from
the
tax
court,
part
from
the
district
court
and
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
his
own
fault
your
honor
because
congress
has
already
--
has
already
given
him
a
method
for
not
having
to
pay
that
tax.
and
if
he
refuses
and
turns
his
back
on
that
method,
then
he
has
lost
his
other
procedure.
now
as
far
as
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
goes
on
this
distraint
business,
i
think
it
would
probably
create
three
classes
of
taxpayers.
ones
who
go
to
the
tax
court,
the
ones
that
go
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims
and
then
the
judgment
proof
type
who
get
this
particular
hybrid
method,
the
people
who
have
their
assets
abroad
or
have
it
in
the
hands
of
corporations
so
that
the
government
can't
get
them.
there
are
lots
of
people
like
that
where
we
cannot
get
the
assets.
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
collect
them,
these
people,
so
our
distraint
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
but
he
had
90
days
your
honor
in
which
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
he's
going
to
pay
this
tax
or
whether
he
is
going
to
petition
the
tax
court.
during
that
90
days,
there
was
absolutely
nothing
the
commissioner
could
do
to
collect
that
tax.
so
he
had
the
--
if
he's
outside
united
states,
he
has
150
days
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
which
avenue
that
congress
has
provided
that
he
wants
to
have
his
taxes
redetermined.
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
government
would?
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
government
would
rather
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
well
your
honor,
the
department
of
justice
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
tax
court
and
we're
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
district
court.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
sir
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
courts
always
appeal
to
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
from
the
tax
court.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
right.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
if
he
sues
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
right.
mr.
john
n.
stull
and
of
course
there
are
many
advantages
your
honor
to
go
into
the
tax
court
just
as
there
are
advantages
to
go
into
the
district
court.
the
tax
court,
for
instance
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
a
body
of
experts
and
there
are
also
all
sorts
of
procedural
things
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
many
taxpayers
too
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
stull
and
if
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
if
congress
is
going
to
let
anybody
go
into
district
court
anytime
they
want
to,
then
there's
no
reason
in
having
a
tax
court
as
far
as
i
could
see.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
correct.
mr.
john
n.
stull
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
whole
history
of
this
thing
and
particularly
at
the
legislative
history
on
the
formation
of
the
tax
court
that
it's
pretty
clear
because
when
congress
formed
the
tax
court,
they
specifically
said
and
we
have
a
legislative
history
in
our
brief
on
pages
14
and
15,
that
it
specifically
recognize
this
hardship
of
people
who
could
not
sue
unless
they
had
to
pay
the
entire
amount
claimed.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir.
and
we're
collecting
it
sir.
well,
in
the
history,
if
you
got
on
the
tax
court,
you
can
--
as
soon
as
you
get
your
90-day
letter,
you
can
pay
immediately
and
if
you're
right,
you
get
it
back
with
6%
interest
but
the
congress
recognize
that
there
was
a
hardship
to
these
people
who
could
not
pay
the
amount
claimed,
so
they
created
the
tax
court.
and
where
it
is
the
hardship,
if
these
people
can
go
and
get
relief
in
the
district
court
if
they
pay
$5,
$1.05
and
file
a
claim
for
refund
and
get
it
back.
there
is
no
hardship
in
that
case.
mr.
john
n.
stull
that
is
right,
they
can't.
and
congress
thought
that
there
was
that
hardship
so
therefore
they
created
the
tax
court.
mr.
john
n.
stull
why
did
he
let
it
go
by
your
honor?
he
knows
that
that
is
his
remedy.
congress
gave
it
to
him.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
if
he's
completely
broke,
he
can
go
into
bankruptcy
then
we
have
to
assess
the
tax
and
prove
like
any
other
claim
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
john
n.
stull
no
sir,
i
meant
but
even
in
your
example,
it
was
the
fellow's
own
fault
because
i'm
judgment
proof,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
this
thing.
i'm
just
going
to
ride
this
thing
through.
let
the
government
come
well
for
the
money.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
it's
in
your
mind
too,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir?
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
true,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
what's
the
difference
between
--
mr.
john
n.
stull
--
5
cents
or
nothing
at
all?
mr.
john
n.
stull
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well
i
can't
see
--
your
honor,
i
can't
see
the
reason
for
being
concerned
about
these
people.
mr.
john
n.
stull
they
talk
about
--
they
talk
about
hardship.
where
is
the
hardship
if
you
can
have
your
questions
tried
out
in
the
district
court
if
there's
only
a
dollar
paid?
if
it's
only
necessary
to
pay.
mr.
john
n.
stull
well,
there
aren't
many
people
who
couldn't
raise
a
dollar,
your
honor
or
5
cents
or
1
cent
as
far
mr.
thrower's
argument
goes.
what
he
is
in
effect
saying,
it's
true
he
paid
$5000
in
this
case
which
is
a
pretty
substantial
amount
to
me
but
the
next
fellow
is
going
to
pay
$5
and
$1.05
and
then
he
would
get
a
declaratory
judgment
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
that
came
in
1935
was
amended
immediately
to
say
that
federal
taxes
should
not
be
included
in
that.
mr.
john
n.
stull
yes
sir.
it's
an
expressed
exception
because
they
said
that
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
whole
history
of
the
collection
of
taxes
to
allow
declaratory
judgment
and
i
can't
see
any
difference
between
paying
a
dollar
or
5
cents
or
$100
or
whatever
it
is
the
fellow
feels
like
paying
and
getting
a
declaratory
judgment.
and
as
far
as
going
after
the
people
go,
it's
going
to
mean
that
the
wage
earner
who
owns
a
house,
we
could
go
sell
his
house,
we
can
attach
his
salary,
we
can
sell
his
car,
we
can
attach
his
bank
account
but
it's
going
to
be
the
clever
operator
who
has
the
tax
that
tied
up
who
is
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
jury
trial
without
ever
having
paid
anything
more
than
a
tiny
token
amount
where
as
the
ordinary
citizen
whom
the
collector
can
distrain
on
is
going
to
be
able
to
only
either
go
to
the
tax
court
without
a
jury
trial
or
take
up
the
money
and
pay
it.
now
if
these
fellows
have
to
pay
the
tax
sometime
anyway,
if
they're
wrong
in
their
determination,
they're
just
trying
to
have
it
tried
out
first
and
it's
true,
i
suppose,
that
you
can
always
take
up
somebody
who
didn't
know
about
the
tax
court,
something
like
that.
there
will
always
be
somebody
around
like
that.
if
that's
the
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
should
take
care
of
that
particular
situation
but
congress
has
given
them
only
two
ways
to
contest
their
taxes
and
it
seems
to
us
that
those
two
ways
are
separate
remedies
and
they're
exclusive
remedies.
mr.
john
n.
stull
your
honor
this
--
this
first
came
up
in
the
third
circuit
in
the
suhr
case
in
1927
and
the
third
circuit
agreed
with
us.
it
was
not
litigated
again
until
the
coates
case
in
1941
and
that
case
contains
a
great
deal
of
language
which
is
helpful
to
the
taxpayer.
we
think
it's
distinguishable
on
a
number
of
grounds
and
one
of
them
is
the
government's
fault.
the
government
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
second
circuit
the
history,
the
legislative
history
and
the
reasons
performed
in
the
tax
court.
in
any
event,
the
tax
what
has
already
paid
by
the
time
the
district
judge
came
on
for
hearing.
and
furthermore,
the
second
circuit
has
--
without
adverting
to
that
case,
made
statements
in
a
number
of
subsequent
and
more
recent
cases
which
are
not
directly
on
this
subject
but
seemed
to
us
to
indicate
that
they
would
have
little
trouble
being
a
distinguishing
or
overruling
that
case
at
the
present
time
for
instance,
in
the
bendheim
case.
they
say
that
the
taxpayer
has
two
independent
procedures
open
to
him.
the
taxpayer
should
not
be
allowed
to
pick
and
choose
a
little
from
each
for
his
own
benefit.
payment
of
the
amount
claimed
to
be
due
is
prerequisite
to
a
suit
for
refund
in
a
federal
court.
the
third
circuit,
in
that
same
year,
came
out
with
sirian
lamp
case
which
was
a
case
against
the
director
and
without
adverting
to
their
original
suhr
case,
held
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer's
position
here.
the
bushmiaer
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
with
one
dissent,
also,
held
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
then
this
case
came
up
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
held
in
favor
of
the
government.
we
think
that
the
earlier
cases
are
distinguishable
that
the
second
circuit
has
practically
overruled
its
own
decision
in
the
coates
case
and
that
the
only
two
cases
with
which
we're
concerned
at
the
moment
are
this
case
and
the
bushmiaer
case.
mr.
john
n.
stull
the
eighth
circuit
is
bushmiaer.
yes,
your
honor.
