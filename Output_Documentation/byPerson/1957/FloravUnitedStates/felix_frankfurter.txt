justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
is
the
scope
of
this
decision
restricted
to
tax
refunds
suits
or
does
it
have,
on
imagination,
is
equal
to
conjuring
up
the
case
but
it
have
applications
and
suits
by
confected
or
in
other
situation
where
a
similar
financial
relationship
is
established,
namely,
a
suit
is
brought
and
the
plaintiff
hasn't
fully
satisfied
his
obligation?
do
you
understand
--
am
i
to
understand
that
this
is
a
specialized
tax
refund
suit
problem
or
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
because
it's
--
the
question
arises
under
the
general
tucker
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
and
in
the
district
court
and
not
in
the
court
of
claims?
this
is
a
tucker
act
problem,
is
it?
this
is
a
supplement
tax
--
tax
refund
suit
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
saying
whatever
restriction
there
may
be
must
derive
from
tax
legislation,
other
substantive
tax
legislation
or
context
of
tax
liabilities
and
obligations
and
rights
and
not
derive
from
the
terms
of
the
tucker
act.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
principally,
i
can
imagine
a
suit
against
the
secretary
of
treasury
for
some
obligations
before
you
by
the
united
states
on
a
contract
basis,
by
the
same
question,
i've
arrived,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
is
that
1346
(a)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1346
(a)
(2)?
where
is
that?
i
don't
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
this
provision
was
in
the
original
tucker
act,
this
very
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
this
come
into
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
before
that,
that's
what
i
assume,
but
before
that
there
couldn't
be
the
this
kind
of
(inaudible)
could
it,
at
all?
could
you
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
1921.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
general
--
the
general
provision
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
brings
me
to
my
--
to
my
difficulty.
under
the
general
tucker
act
--
under
the
general
--
under
the
old
tucker
act
before
you
had
this
special
authorization
in
tax
matters,
you
could
sue
the
united
states
under
the
--
because
a
consent
was
given,
because
there
was
a
contract
or
--
or
a
property
had
been
taken,
etcetera.
could
you
sue
before
there
was
a
loss,
before
you
had
established
your
loss?
what
you're
asking
in
effectively
to
this
kind
of
a
case
is
that
the
declaratory
judgment
that
he's
wrong
in
his
interpretation
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
out
of
pocket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
you
conceded
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
chief
justice
asks
you
whether
it
made
any
difference
of
how
much
or
how
little
and
you
said,
“no.”
you
have
to
pay
some
part
of
the
allegedly
illegal
assessment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
have
gone
to
--
but
may
gone
to
a
--
the
appropriate
district
court
and
say
this
is
an
allegedly
--
this
isn't
a
wrong
--
an
illegal
assessment
and
we
want
to
get
a
declaration
that
it
is
without
paying
any
portion
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
you're
not
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
have
to
pay
any
portion
of
what
you
claim
to
be
an
illegal
assessment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
why
the
statute
says,
“alleged
to
have
been
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
or
collected."
is
that
some
other
provision
of
a
statute
which
requires
payment?
the
court
of
claims
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
illegally
assessed
is
not
--
can't
be
construed
in
that
way.
it
means
collecting
payment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
i'm
driving
at.
the
illegally
--
the
illegally
assessed
is
not
given
forth
because
you
must
say
something.
as
you
point
out
the
statute
also
says,
“the
recovery
of
what
is
illegally
assessed.”
so
that's
kind
of
strange
craftsmanship
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
me
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
the
same
would
lie
beyond
that
question
maybe
differently
stated.
isn't
it
a
valid
consideration,
i'm
passing
on
this
question
that
the
litigation
would
be
cause
--
would
take
its
cause
through
the
tax
court
rather
--
rather
a
district
court
not
because
you'd
rather
but
because
that's
a
wider
--
that's
the
wider
basis
for
the
relationship
between
tax
assessment
and
judicial
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i'm
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that's
what
i
said.
that's
what
i'm
suggesting,
that
you
go
to
the
specialized
court
and
then
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
there's
an
allowable
construction,
you
say
that's
a
valid
thing
to
take
into
consideration.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
you
have
to
prefer
a
lot
of
district
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
summary
in
stringent,
summary
in
stringent
sounds
to
me
like
a
string.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
the
exception
haven't
been
made
of
declaratory
judgment
act
not
a
penny
would
have
been
required
to
be
paid
for
the
taxpayer
to
go
in
and
get
a
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
but
there's
a
difference
between
saying
you
don't
have
to
pay
a
penny
and
get
a
--
have
a
--
start
a
litigation
without
paying
anything
and
paying
a
part.
there's
a
difference.
i
am
not
saying
what
the
legal
consequences
are
but
the
declaratory
judgment
exception
shows
what
can't
be
done
if
congress
wanted
to
say
what
can't
be
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
agreeing
with
you
as
to
the
importance
of
that
statute.
i'm
suggesting
it
different
between
the
problem
that
would
have
been
direct
or
the
situation
that
would
have
confronted
the
government
if
that
limitation
had
been
--
had
not
been
placed
upon
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
the
problem
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case.
there's
a
great
difference
between
the
two.
that
if
the
--
if
the
declaratory
judgment
exception
had
not
been
made
and
the
implication
has
not
been
read
into
it,
then
our
tax
--
all
the
taxpayers
would
say,
“where
would
we
get
a
relief
from
the
court
without
paying
a
penny?”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
be
jurisdiction
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
be
in
the
jurisdiction
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
cheatham
doesn't
control
this
case,
you
don't
think
that
controls
this
case,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
problem
adverted
to
in
--
in
briefs
or
arguments
anything
except
this
talk
in
cheatham.
is
there
anything
in
cheatham
except
a
passing
reference
not
related
to
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
think
that
that
passing
reference,
or
that
reference
in
cheatham
under
a
totally
different
statute
with
the
problem
not
in
the
mind
of
the
court
at
all
so
far
have
any
--
any
indication
was
implied
be
put
into
the
statute
in
1921.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
use
the
language
to
which
justice
harlan
just
called
attention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
congress
can
change
that
universality
that
we
did
by
writing
a
different
jurisdictional
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
so
universal
that
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
word
of
the
statute,
nothing
else
except
the
word
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know,
you
don't
know
what
would
have
happen
if
the
question
had
no
reason
then
with
that
language
in
it?
you
don't
know
and
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
to
ask
mr.
rice
to
that
thing.
i'll
ask
you
have
you
got
any
figure
which
showed
roughly
sufficiently
with
approximate
accuracy
the
proportion
of
cases
of
--
of
taxpayers
who
raised
the
court
of
the
tax
court
as
against
going
to
the
district
court
under
the
tucker
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
--
in
terms
of
money,
is
there
are
any
light
--
is
there
any
light
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
interested
in
the
question
of
the
money
that
is
withheld
can
be
legally
considerably
withheld
by
going
to
the
tax
court.
