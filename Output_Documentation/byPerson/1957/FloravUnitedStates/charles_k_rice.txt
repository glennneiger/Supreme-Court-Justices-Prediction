mr.
charles
k.
rice
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
case
was
correctly
decided
on
the
prior
submission.
there
has
been
nothing
shown
by
the
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
which
would
warrant
any
rehearsal
of
that
decision
and
that
the
decision
should
be
adhered
to
as
it
was
originally
rendered.
more
succinctly,
our
position
is
that
there
are
only
two
methods
in
which
tax
controversies
can
be
decided.
one
is
by
petition
to
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states,
prior
payment
of
the
tax
and
resolution
in
that
manner
or
secondly,
by
payment
of
the
full
amount
of
the
tax
due
and
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
or
the
district
court
and
resolution
in
that
manner.
now
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
excise
tax
your
honor
is
a
different
matter.
that
would
go
only
to
the
district
courts
or
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
but
not
go
to
the
--
would
not
go
to
the
tax
court.
now
i
think
the
--
i
might
point
out
parenthetically
here
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
distinction
is
that
excise
taxes
are
usually
passed
on
and
usually
collected
from
the
seller
rather
than
purchaser
who
was
the
one
who
actually
reports
them.
and
for
that
reason,
there
wasn't
the
hardship
that
you
found
in
the
income
tax
and
the
state
tax
cases
of
having
to
pay
before
you
could
litigate
so
--
because
in
the
excise
tax
cases,
the
person
who
filed
the
return
wasn't
really
a
person
who's
paying
it.
now
that
i
think
was
the
reason
why
the
excise
taxes
were
not
included.
at
the
outset,
we
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
shift
which
has
taken
place
from
time
to
time
in
the
taxpayer's
position
in
this
case
as
it's
gone
through
that.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
i'm
not
sure
but
i'll
recall
exactly
what
the
question
was.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
we
rely
primarily
on
the
construction
of
the
statute
itself
and
we
regard
the
administrative
practice
is
only
utmost
a
make
way
point.
we
rely
primarily
on
the
statutes.
now
we
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
outset
--
the
shifting
positions
which
the
taxpayer
has
taken
in
this
case,
if
you
will
recall
when
this
case
was
before
you
--
the
first
time,
the
emphasis
then
was
largely
on
the
fact
that
after
all
the
collector
could
command
and
recover
the
balance
of
any
tax,
so
that
the
united
states
was
not
without
remedy
and
what
harm
was
there
in
permitting
the
person
to
pay
part
of
the
tax
and
sue
for
the
recovery.
and
that
as
you
may
recall
is
the
theory
of
sirian
lamp
in
the
third
circuit
and
the
taxpayer's
position
was
pitched
primarily
on
that
point,
i
think,
in
the
first
presentation
of
this
court.
well,
this
court
met
that
head
on
in
its
original
opinion
by
reviewing
the
statutory
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
statutes
involved
and
particular
--
particular
reference
to
the
legislative
history
relating
to
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
hardship
which
congress
was
seeking
to
alleviate
in
creating
the
board
of
tax
appeals
was
not
the
hardship
of
post
collec
--
of
post
litigation
collection
of
the
hardship
of
free
litigation
payment.
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
very
amply
bears
that
out.
well,
that
was
the
first
go
around.
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
the
emphasis
shifted
and
then
it
was
said
that
--
that
the
government
had
alleged
as
it
did
that
the
practice
over
the
years,
the
treasury
practice
had
been
consistent
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
it
urged,
and
the
petitioner
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
had
a
great
deal
--
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
that
and
contended
that
in
fact
the
practice
was
quite
the
opposite.
now,
however
when
we
come
to
the
third
stage
on
the
--
on
the
briefing
on
rehearing,
there's
relatively
little
emphasis
on
the
practice
and
if
you
will
refer
to
page
22
of
the
taxpayer's
main
brief
on
rehearing,
you'll
find
the
statement
that
such
a
practice,
even
if
shown,
even
if
the
government
showed
it
that
it'd
hardly
be
material
for
the
construction
of
statutory
language
drafted
almost
100
years
ago.
in
other
words,
the
practice
isn't
very
material
according
to
the
taxpayer
on
his
present
argument.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
i
don't
quite
know
how
to
respond.
the
question
is
whether
his
brief
is
incorrectly
stated.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
if
the
question
is
whether
you
may,
as
i
assume
to
this,
whether
you
may
maintain
an
action
in
the
district
courts
to
recover
part
of
a
tax
assessment
which
has
been
paid,
then
that
is
the
question
before
the
court.
now
after
on
the
--
if
to
complete
my
reference
to
the
shifting
positions
of
the
taxpayer,
we
find
the
emphasis
at
this
stage
of
the
argument
not
so
much
on
what
the
practice
has
been
because
the
taxpayer
states
in
his
brief
that
that
could
hardly
be
material
to
the
construction
of
statutes
enacted
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago.
the
emphasis
now
is
that
on
suits
against
the
collector
and
it
is
said
that
in
the
personal
actions
against
the
collector
that
you
could
have
sued
him
for
part
payment
and
therefore
the
same
thing
must
be
assumed
in
suits
against
the
united
states.
well
that
is
the
emphasis
here.
now
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
--
after
adverting
to
those
shifting
positions
to
submit
that
there's
no
merit
to
any
of
them
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
its
earlier
opinion
should
be
reaffirmed.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
the
rule
of
--
of
payment
first
and
litigate
--
litigate
later
was
a
well
understood
principle
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
tucker
act
was
enacted
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
tucker
was
incorporated
in
the
revenue
act
of
1921,
was
well
understood
by
congress
and
was
well
understood
by
the
bar,
and
was
incorporated
as
an
essential
provision
of
those
acts.
now
one
of
the
difficulties
which
i
think
the
taxpayer
had
to
this
case
is
that
he
can't
quite
see
why
there
should
be
such
a
rule.
it
seems
a
very
arbitrary
and
--
and
perhaps
unnecessary
rule
to
him,
but
the
reason
for
the
rule
is
equally
rooted
and
it's
rooted
in
the
need
of
government.
it's
rooted
in
the
need
of
government
for
a
prompt
and
sure
tax
collection
and
except
this,
mr.
justice
miller
said
in
the
cheatham
case,
except
for
such
--
with
such
exceptions
as
the
lawmakers'
deem
expedient
that
is
the
governing
principle.
now
you
see
that
back
in
cary
against
curtis,
which
i
hope
to
be
able
to
get
back
to
later
when
we
discuss
the
collectors,
suits
against
the
collectors
where
they
said
regularity
and
certainty
in
the
payment
of
the
revenue
must
be
admitted
by
everyone
as
a
primary
importance.
they
must
be
said
almost
to
constitute
the
basis
of
good
faith
in
the
transactions
of
the
government
to
be
essential
to
its
practical
existence.
and
in
cheatham
itself
where
they
said
if
there
existed
in
the
courts
any
general
power
of
impeding
or
controlling
the
collection
of
taxes
or
relieving
the
hardship
incident
to
taxation
the
very
existence
of
the
government
might
be
placed
in
the
power
of
a
--
of
a
hostile
judiciary.
and
then
going
on
to
say
in
the
internal
revenue
branch,
it
has
been
further
prescribed
that
no
such
suit
shall
be
brought
until
a
remedy
by
an
appeal
has
been
tried.
and
if
brought
after
this,
it
must
be
brought
within
six
months
after
the
decision
on
the
appeal.
we
regard
this
as
a
condition
on
which
alone
the
government
consents
to
litigate
the
lawfulness
of
the
original
tax.
it
is
not
a
hard
condition;
few
governments
have
conceded
such
a
right
on
any
condition.
if
the
compliance
of
this
condition
requires
the
party
aggrieved
to
pay
the
tax,
he
must
do
it.
he
cannot
after
the
decision
is
rendered
against
him,
protract
the
time
within
which
he
can
contest
that
decision
in
the
courts
by
his
own
delay
in
paying
the
money.
it
is
essential
to
the
honor
and
orderly
conduct
for
the
government
that
its
taxes
should
be
promptly
paid
and
drawback
speedily
adjusted
and
the
rule
prescribed
in
these
classes
of
cases
is
neither
arbitrary
nor
unreasonable.
and
at
the
same
term
this
court
said
in
the
state
railroad
tax
cases,
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
provided
both
in
the
customs
and
in
the
internal
revenue
a
complete
system
of
corrective
justice
in
regard
to
all
taxes
imposed
for
the
general
government
which
in
both
branches
is
founded
upon
the
idea
of
appeals
within
the
executive
departments.
if
a
party
aggrieved
does
not
contain
satisfaction
in
this
mode
there
provisions
for
the
recovering
of
tax
after
it
has
been
paid
by
suit
against
the
collecting
officer,
but
there
is
no
place
in
this
system,
meaning
the
federal
tax
system,
or
an
application
to
a
court
of
justice
until
after
the
money
is
paid
that
there
might
be
no
misunderstanding
of
the
universality
of
this
principle.
it
was
expressly
enacted
in
1867
that
no
suit
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
any
tax
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court.
and
though
this
was
intended
to
apply
alone
to
taxes
levied
by
the
united
states,
it
shows
the
sense
of
congress
of
the
evils
to
be
feared
if
courts
of
justice
could
in
any
case
interfere
with
the
process
of
collecting
taxes
on
which
the
government
depends
for
its
continued
existence.
it
is
a
wise
policy.
it
is
founded
in
the
simple
philosophy
derived
from
the
experience
of
ages
that
the
payment
of
taxes
has
to
be
enforced
by
summary
and
stringent
means
against
a
reluctant
and
often
adverse
sentiment
and
to
do
this
successfully,
other
instrumentalities
and
other
modes
of
procedure
are
necessary
than
those
which
belong
to
courts
of
justice,
citing
the
cheatham
case
and
two
other
cases.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
by
a
summary
means
--
well
i
will
branch
your
honor
that
the
collection
procedures
often
--
of
the
government
often
referred
to
as
summary
procedures
but
i
think
the
point
which
the
court
was
trying
to
make
there
was
that
taxes
have
to
be
collected
--
have
to
paid
in.
the
government
must
meet
its
obligations
on
time
except
when
congress
--
unless
congress
has
provided
otherwise,
the
litigation
must
come
after
the
payment.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
if
there
were
a
willful
failure
to
pay,
of
course,
there'd
be
a
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
he
doesn't
pay
that,
of
course,
if
he
doesn't
pay
over
a
continued
period
of
time
that
would
set
the
collection
procedures
in
motion.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
and
if
all
taxpayers
did
that,
we'd
be
in
a
--
in
a
very
bad
way.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
no
your
honor,
we
don't
think
it
is
the
law.
the
law
is
you
must
pay
on
time.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
you
pay
or
pay
interest
or
you're
prosecuted
if
you
willfully
fail
to
pay.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
feel
we
could
rest
our
case
right
there,
that
showing
the
--
the
principle
lying
back
of
the
requirement
of
payment
first
and
litigating
after
which
was
well
understood
and
enunciated
by
this
court
and
we
believe
necessarily
incorporated
in
the
tucker
act
and
in
the
revenue
act
of
1921
and
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
strict
construction
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
we
feel
that
we
could
rest
the
case
right
there,
but
in
addition
to
that,
all
of
the
subsequent
action
taken
by
congress,
various
interrelated
statutes
tend
strongly
to
confirm
this
belief.
you
have
it
in
1867
in
the
anti-injunction
statute
which
clearly
manifested
an
intention
to
prevent
any
interference
with
the
prompt
collection
of
taxes.
you
have
it
again
in
the
statutory
history
relating
to
the
creation
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
or
despite
all
of
the
long
debate
the
many
reports
and
so
forth
on
that
act
the
taxpayer
has
been
unable
to
point
to
a
single
reference
which
would
contemplate
and
that
it
would
possible
to
pay
part
of
the
assessment
and
suit
rather
than
pay
all
of
it.
and
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
conclusively
demonstrates
as
this
court
found
in
the
earlier
opinion,
at
the
hardship
which
the
--
which
they
were
providing
against
was
the
hardship
of
payment
of
all
of
the
tax
before
litigation.
we
think
that
it
would
inexplicable
that
then
the
long
debates
over
that
act
in
the
committee
reports
there
would,
by
experts
on
appeal,
there
would
not
be
a
single
word
said
to
indicate
that
the
hardship
really
was
not
having
to
pay
all
the
tax.
the
hardship
was
having
the
collector
come
after
you,
after
you
would
pay
part
of
it.
and
then
finally
going
to
the
declaratory
judgment
act
1934
or
1935
where
at
first
it
appeared
that
declaratory
judgments
could
be
rendered
with
respect
to
tax
controversies.
in
a
subsequent
amendment
they
removed
tax
controversies
from
the
coverage
of
the
act,
and
this
court
in
great
lakes
against
huffman,
319
u.s.,
stated
that
the
amendment
excluding
taxes
was
passed
merely
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
here
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
would
not
permit
a
radical
departure
from
the
long
continued
policy
of
congress
to
require
a
prompt
of
federal
taxes.
in
other
words,
the
same
principle
that
was
originally
enunciated
this
far
back
as
cary
against
curtis
continued
on
through
cheatham,
state
railroad
tax
cases,
and
other
cases
of
that
type.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
that
maybe
true
your
honor
but
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
but
the
exception
was
made.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
i
don't
know
whether
i
--
i
couldn't
say
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
act
was
broad
enough
in
its
terms.
i
haven't
studied
enough
to
say
whether
it
would
have
covered
taxes
without
this
amendment
or
not,
but
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
it
clear
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
now,
coming
next
to
the
matter
of
suits
against
the
collector,
matters
had
probably
the
court
knows
rather
interesting
history
in
that
suits
were
first
permitted
against
the
collector
as
far
back
as
1837
in
elliott
against
swartwout
or
there
was
when
taxes
had
been
paid
under
protest,
there
was
implied
a
promise
to
repay
up
it
had
been
wrongfully
collected.
that
was
quite
a
bit
of
confusion
in
the
revenue
system
because
when
collectors
realized
that
they
were
under
that
liability,
they
simply
refused
to
turn
over
taxes
which
they
--
which
had
been
paid
to
them
under
protest
and
they
held
them
aside
to
cover
any
liability
they
might
have.
so
because
of
that
situation,
the
congress
enacted
an
act
saying
collectors
must
turnover
taxes
whether
paid
under
protest
or
not.
so
thereafter,
they
did
turn
them
over
but
when
a
suit
was
commenced
against
the
collector,
it
was
held
in
cary
against
curtis
that
the
suit
couldn't
be
maintained
because
if
the
collector
was
under
a
statutory
duty
to
turnover
the
tax
to
the
treasury,
you
couldn't
imply
any
promise
on
his
part
to
return
it.
and
therefore
the
--
you
couldn't
have
any
remedy
against
the
collector.
well,
that
brought
congress
into
action
and
they
enacted
an
act
in
1845
saying
that
they
hadn't
meant
to
--
as
far
as
collector
of
customs
is
concerned,
they
hadn't
meant
to
take
away
any
action
against
the
collector
and
that
they
intended
that
action
should
be
brought
against
collectors.
and
the
same
thing
has
been
held
with
respect
to
suits
their
collection
of
internal
revenue
taxes
not
by
virtue
of
any
express
statutory
language
as
we
had
in
1845
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
the
collectors
--
i
mean
with
respect
to
the
customs
people
but
as
an
implication
from
statutes,
providing
for
reimbursement
of
the
collector
in
requiring
the
statute
--
collectors
to
turn
over
the
money
and
making
them
whole
for
any
loss
they
may
have
suffered,
congress
held
that
--
i
mean
the
court
held
that
congress
had
impliedly
consented
the
suits
against
collectors.
now
the
important
point
here
is
that
this
action
in
that
form
was
no
longer
a
common
law
action
against
the
collector.
and
as
this
court
said
in
auffmordt
against
hedden,
137
u.s.,
the
right
to
bring
such
a
suit
is
exclusively
statutory
and
is
substituted
for
any
and
every
common
law
right.
so
our
contention
is
that
there
are
no
more
basis
for
the
--
for
a
suit
against
the
collector
for
a
part
payment
than
there
is
against
a
--
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
and
in
that
connection
we
have
to
remember
that
cheatham
itself
in
which
the
rule
of
payment
first
and
litigate
later
was
strongly
announced,
cheatham
itself
was
an
action
against
the
collector
and
the
tucker
act
did
not
then
come
into
being
and
the
rule
itself
being
enunciated
in
that
type
of
case,
we
contend
that
suit
could
no
more
be
brought
against
the
collector
for
a
part
payment
than
suit
could
be
brought
against
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
which
statute
do
you
refer
to?
mr.
charles
k.
rice
the
tucker
act
of
1887.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
i
didn't
codify
the
common
law
because
a
common
law,
you
couldn't
sue
the
united
states
who
took
the
statute
to
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
codify
the
common
law
as
to
the
collector.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
don't
think
it
did,
your
honor,
because
it
didn't
purport
to
apply
to
the
collector
it
was
against
suits
against
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
the
suits
against
the
collector
derived
their
statutory
authority
from
acts
in
1860s,
1962,
1963,
1964
where
there
were
statutes
which
provided
for
reimbursement
of
the
collector
and
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
--
the
contention
made,
rejected
for
--
rejected
here
that
the
--
after
all
the
collector
could
come
after
the
taxpayer
with
the
balance
of
the
tax
and
collected
so
that
the
principle
of
pay
first
is
really
grounded
on
that
fact
that
there
could
be
--
if
you
didn't
pay,
there
would
be
summary
collection.
there,
i'd
like
to
say
that
in
a
self
assessment
system,
we
simply
cannot
compel
the
government
to
resort
to
summary
and
extraordinary
procedures
for
the
collection
of
all
moneys
which
go
into
litigation.
we
have
now
something
like
$1.5
billion
involved
in
federal
tax
litigation
and
each
of
those
taxpayers
could
pay
$1
or
$10
in
payment
of
his
tax
liability
and
sue
compelling
the
united
states
collect
the
balance
by
summary
and
extraordinary
procedures
which
are
designed
for
the
(inaudible)
of
taxpayers,
we
would
be
in
a
rather
difficult
position,
i
think.
now
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
don't
think
they're
quite
simple
your
honor.
there's
quite
a
lot
of
work,
i
think,
attending
upon
each
summary
collection,
it's
work
of
maybe
paperwork,
it's
work
of
going
out
into
the
field,
it's
work
of
filing
papers,
there's
quite
a
lot
of
work
to
do
it.
and
if
we've
got
to
do
that,
well
virtually,
all
of
the
$1.5
billion
now
in
litigation
and
undoubtedly
that's
going
to
increase
in
amount.
it's
going
to
be
a
very
substantial
proposition.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes,
it
does.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes,
that's
true,
of
course.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
but
much
of
--
but
much
of
that,
your
honor,
we
feel
it
would
not
be
in
the
tax
court
if
this
court
sustained
the
taxpayer
here.
it
would
be
in
the
district
court
by
all
the
$1
payment.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
no,
it
wouldn't.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
we
contend,
of
course
that
--
though
that
language
was
taken
from
the
claim
for
refund
statutes
which
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
pardon
me.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes
it
is
your
honor.
but
it
was
taken
from
the
claim
for
refund
statutes
which
was
the
very
statutes
which
this
court
was
construing
in
cheatham.
where
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
not
--
not
in
holding,
your
honor,
no
not
in
holding,
but
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
we
think
that
the
reference
in
cheatham
where
they
talked
of
paying
the
money
first,
taken
in
combination
with
the
references
to
the
fact
that
the
government
depends
for
its
very
existence
on
the
collection
of
taxes
must
mean
that
payment
first
means
payment
of
all
the
tax.
taken
in
context,
we
think
it
can't
mean
anything
else.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
we
think
--
we
think
that
this
is
a
principle
which
in
the
state
railroad
tax
cases
was
said
to
be
of
universality
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
and
so
it
can
your
honor,
but
here
--
here
we
have
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
so
here
we
have
the
--
the
doctrine
of
strict
construction
of
waiver
sovereign
immunity
and
if
such
a
principle
exists
and
we
find
no
--
no
indication
of
any
intention
to
abandon
that,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
the
statute
back
in
the
--
in
the
claim
for
refund
days
had
the
same
language
in
it.
and
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
we
don't
know
--
we
think
we
know.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
thank
you.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
your
honor,
may
i
ask
the
counsel
a
question
on
(inaudible)
referring
to
justice
frankfurter's
question.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
it's
not
out
in
a
million
and
a
half
of
the
taxpayer
--
