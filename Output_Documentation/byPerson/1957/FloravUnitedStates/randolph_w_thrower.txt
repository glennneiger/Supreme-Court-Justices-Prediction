mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
that's
here
rises
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
single
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
to
recover
an
alleged
overpayment
of
tax.
the
facts
here
are
not
in
dispute.
the
taxpayer
filed
his
return
and
in
his
return,
deducted
a
large
loss
as
being
an
ordinary
loss.
the
commissioner,
upon
investigation,
disallowed
the
loss
asserting
that
it
was
a
capital
loss
and
does
not
deducted
--
not
deductible
and
asserted
a
deficiency
which
was
subsequently
assessed
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$28,000.
in
response
to
notice
and
demand,
the
taxpayer
paid
a
little
more
than
$5000.
he,
thereafter,
filed
a
claim
for
refund.
that
claim
was
rejected
on
the
merits.
the
taxpayer
then
brought
this
suit
to
recover
the
payments
that
had
been
made.
the
government,
in
answering
the
complaint,
pleaded
that
there
had
been
no
overpayment,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
an
additional
amount
was
owed
and
counterclaimed
for
the
balance
of
the
unpaid
assessment
of
about
$23,000.
at
the
same
time,
it
also
moved
in
effect
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
the
entire
assessment
had
not
been
paid
before
bringing
the
suit.
now
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
that
motion
to
dismiss
should
have
been
granted.
it
is,
we
believe,
as
if
a
sues
b
to
recover
a
payment
which
he
assessed
to
have
been
erroneous
and
excessive.
b
responds
that
a
not
only
owed
the
amount
that
was
paid
but
also
owes
an
additional
amount
and
b
counterclaims
for
that
additional
amount
as
the
government
did
here.
now
under
all
normal
concepts
of
pleadings
and
jurisdiction,
this
response
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
claim
and
the
counterclaim
but
does
not
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
now
we
submit
simply
that
the
normal
concepts
of
jurisdiction
apply
in
this
case.
now
the
parties
agreed
that
jurisdiction
in
the
case
rests
upon
a
construction
of
section
1346
(a)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
which
was
familiarly
referred
to
as
the
tucker
act
of
1887.
now
if
i
may
read
certain
pertinent
portions
of
that
section
it
provides,
"the
district
courts
shall
have
original
jurisdiction,
concurrent
with
the
court
of
claims,
of
any
civil
action
against
the
united
states
for
the
recovery
of
any
internal-revenue
tax
alleged
to
have
been
erroneously
or
illegally
assessed
or
collected,
of
any
penalty
and
so
forth,
or
of
any
sum
alleged
to
have
been
excessive
or
in
any
manner
wrongfully
collected
under
the
internal
revenue
law."
now
the
government,
if
i
properly
understand
its
brief,
admits
that
the
literal
meaning
of
this
language
does
support
jurisdiction.
now
such
an
admission,
that
we
believe,
is
required
by
the
statute,
the
words,
“any
civil
action
for
the
recovery
of
any
internal-revenue
tax
or
of
any
sum
alleged
to
have
been
excessive
or
in
any
manner
wrongfully
collected,”
are
very
broad
and
very
comprehensive.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
it
would
not.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
may
i
state
further
in
that
connection.
if
we
think
that
the
amount
that
is
paid
would
be
of
significance
only
if
the
taxpayer
upon
making
this
small
payment
was
thereafter
free
to
withhold
the
balance
of
the
tax.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
he
is
not
and
i
will
develop,
if
i
may,
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
argument
a
little
further
on.
with
respect
to
the
language
of
this
statute
which
i
read
in
part,
no
words
of
restriction
whatsoever
are
included.
it
would
be,
in
fact,
difficult
for
us
to
suggest
any
language
which
could
be
added
to
broaden
this
description
if
it
did
not
already
cover
up.
the
government
would,
nevertheless,
have
this
court
read
into
this
language
the
proviso
that
suit
may
not
be
brought
where
the
entire
amount
claimed
by
the
government
has
not
yet
been
paid.
now
there
is
no
way
we
can
see
where
such
language
can
be
read
into
the
statute.
the
government,
in
reality,
is
asking
for
an
amendment
of
the
statute
to
add
this
proviso
rather
than
simply
for
statutory
construction.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
it
is
--
i
understand
your
question.i
think
that
the
--
it
is
specialized
in
the
sense
that
it
is
raised
by
the
government
only
in
this
type
of
case.
i
would
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
the
same
question,
i
am
confident,
would
be
raised
by
the
government
in
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
would
also
be
raised
by
the
government
in
a
suit
against
a
collector
or
director
personally
which
does
not
arise
under
of
the
tucker
act
but
it
would
be
raised
under
a
different
section.
as
to
the
specialized
nature
of
it,
i
would
see
no
more
justification
for
reading
this
proviso
into
these
sections
then
reading
it
into
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well
it
is
here
a
question
of
--
of
construction
of
a
statute
to
express
the
intent
of
congress
as
reflected
in
the
statute.
the
government
refers
to
a
number
of
statute
as
supporting
its
position
but
we
submit
that
there
is
no
statute
which
directly
or
indirectly
reflects
or
suggests
this
proviso
while
a
reference
is
made
by
the
government
to
the
particular
language
of
section
1346
(a).
that
was
introduced
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
only
in
1921.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
that
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
petitioner's
original
brief.
it's
also
set
forth
early
in
the
--
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
now
that
language,
may
i
add
here,
was
introduced
in
1921
by
a
statute
which
the
government
in
its
brief
admits
was
not
intended
to
cover
this
problem
and
yet
it
relies
on
that
section
to
support
the
proviso
that
is
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
1346
(a)
(1),
it
would
be.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
set
forth
on
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
page
2
of
our
original
brief.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
phase
that
it
incorporates
normal
concepts
of
jurisdiction
that
there
is
no
suggestion
of
the
unusual
proviso
urged
by
the
government
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
that.
we'll
refer
briefly
to
some
of
the
arguments
made
in
the
government's
brief
which
have
been
accepted
by
the
court
below.
the
government,
for
one
thing,
relies
upon
general
statements
made
from
time
to
time
in
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
stated
in
generalities
which
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
show
that
the
court
was
directing
its
attention
to
the
particular
problem
which
we
have
here
of
a
taxpayer
who
faces
an
assessment
that
is
greater
than
he
is
able
to
pay
but
asserts
that
what
he
has
paid
is
an
overpayment
of
tax.
the
government
also
ignores
what
was
settled
authority
in
this
field
for
many
years
prior
to
the
decision
below.
this
case
--
this
question
first
rose
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
1940
and
there
was
a
clear
rejection
of
the
government's
argument,
that
was
in
coates
versus
united
states,
where
the
court
there
stated
that
these
arguments,
as
i
have
said,
go
to
the
merits
of
the
claim
or
counterclaim
and
they
do
not
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
in
the
following
year,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
an
action
against
the
director
or
collector
reached
the
same
results.
now,
the
government
grounds
much
of
its
entire
argument
here
upon
the
assumption
that
the
bringing
of
this
suit,
in
some
way,
restrains
the
director
from
the
collection
of
the
balance
of
the
tax
but
it
does
not
appoint
to
anything
which
would
cause
such
restraint.
no
restraint
was
sought
here.
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
of
that
would
support
such
restraint.
there
is
no
legislation
that
would
support.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
an
assessment
was
made.
the
--
a
notice
and
demand
was
served.
there
were
two
payments,
installment
payments
made
in
satisfaction
--
in
partial
satisfaction
of
the
notice
and
demand.
the
taxpayer
filed
a
claim
for
refund
two
years
after
the
date
--
more
than
two
years
after
the
date
of
the
assessment
--
this
suit
was
brought.
there
was
ample
opportunity
for
the
director
to
collect
the
balance
of
this
tax
if
there
has
been
ability
to
pay.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
he
can
take
all
of
his
profits
with
the
exception
of
a
few
work
animals,
a
few
school
books,
some
furniture,
kitchen
equipment
and
the
like.
the
government
here
in
this
type
of
case
which
sees
upon
inability
to
pay,
to
deny
the
taxpayer
the
right
ever
to
contest
what
he
is
to
contest,
ever
to
seek
to
recover
of
what
he
is
able
to
pay
and
what
he
claims
to
be
an
overpayment.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
this
was
introduced
only
in
1921.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
oh
--
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
before
that,
we
could,
under
the
tucker
act,
bring
an
action
to
recover
a
tax
as
being
founded
our
right
to
--sue
being
founded
upon
a
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
and
this
court
so
held
in
two
cases.
one,
emery,
bird,
thayer
realty
company
case
which
is
cited
and
then
another
case
cited
at
the
same
time
which
is
not
cited.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
may
i
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
no.
i
would
like,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
have
paid
$5058
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
which
we
contend
is
an
overpayment
of
tax.
we
filed
a
claim
for
refund
to
recover
the
$5058.
that
claim
for
refund
was
rejected
on
the
merit.
now,
we
filed
that
claim
shortly
before
the
statute
would
have
run.
it's
clear
that
the
statute
in
requiring
the
filing
of
the
claim
within
two
years,
contemplates
that
such
a
claim
may
be
filed.
it
was
filed.
it
was
rejected
on
the
merit
under
section
6532
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
we
had
two
years
following
rejection
to
suit.
we
did
bring
suit
within
the
two-year
period.
if
we
had
not
brought
suit
within
the
two-year
period,
our
--
our
action
would
have
been
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
the
government's
argument
here
would
attribute
to
congress
the
intent
to
create
this
incongruity
that
where
there
is
an
inability
to
pay
the
total
amount
of
an
assessment.
we
must,
nevertheless,
file
our
claims
to
recover
what
is
paid
or
the
statute
will
run.where
that
claim
is
rejected,
we
must
bring
out
suit
within
two
years
or
the
statute
will
run.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
under
the
law,
we
are
required
to
pay
the
entire
amount
of
the
assessment
if
we
are
able
to
pay.
under
the
law,
the
director
has
limitless
power
to
collect.
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
are
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
to
state
it
technically
not
seeking
such
a
declaration.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
are
seeking
to
recover
an
overpayment
which
we
claim
was
not
due
now
as
i
stated
before.
we
think
--
we
submit
that
the
amount
of
our
payment
would
be
significant
only
if,
in
some
way,
we
were
able
to
use
this
as
a
device
to
avoid
payment
but
we're
not.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
oh,
yes.
yes.
we
--
we
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
may
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
has
always
been
read
into
this
section
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
that
we
cannot
claim.
it
is
for
the
recovery
and
we
cannot
--
that
section
there
refers
to
recovery.
we
cannot
recover
an
amount
unless
that
amount
has
been
paid.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well
it
--
it
says,
“illegally
assessed
or
collected,”
and
it
says,
of
any
sum
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
it
is
a
succession
of
words
which
described
the
nature
of
the
action.
the
broadest
description
of
all
is,
“or
any
sum
which
is
alleged
to
have
been
excessive.”
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
that's
right.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
that's
right.
that
shows
clear
contemplation
that
there
has
been
a
payment
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
which
we
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
the
record
does
not
show
that
in
this
case.
in
most
of
the
cases
cited,
that
is
not
shown.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
the
point
we
would
make
is,
that
he
does
have
that
shown.
he
cannot
pay
and
refrain
because,
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
brought
out
by
his
question,
the
director
has
unlimited
powers
to
take
everything
that
the
man
has.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
that
is
precisely
it.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
that
is
precisely
the
question.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
referring
briefly
to
the
cases,
i
will
call
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
the
suhr
case
referred
to
in
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
that
court
14
years
later
in
sirian
lamp
company
versus
manning,
reversed
a
district
court
decision
which
had,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
misinterpreted
suhr
case,
and
the
suhr
case
we
think
is
distinguishable.
it
was
not
even
referred
to
by
this
court
in
old
colony
trust
company
versus
commissioner
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
deals
with
a
case
arising
under
the
1924
act,
the
fist
act
involving
the
board
of
tax
appeals
where
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
board
and
thereafter,
a
suit
for
refund
and
the
court
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
that
suit
could
be
maintained
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
an
outstanding
assessment
of
the
deficiency
of
which
had
not
yet
been
paid.
the
government
has
suggested
that
somehow
the
taxpayer
is
at
fault
who
finds
himself
in
this
unfortunate
position
of
making
himself
a
judgment
proof.
i
think
that
is
entirely
unrealistic,
almost
unconscionable.
this
is
the
unusual
case,
most
taxpayers
fortunately,
can
pay
but
their
--
by
reason
of
an
adverse
turn
of
circumstances
or
otherwise,
a
taxpayer
finding
himself
unable
to
pay
an
assessment
pays
as
he
should
pay
and
is
required
to
pay
all
that
he
can.it
is
immoral
to
withhold
that
if
it
is
erroneously
and
illegally
collected.
and
this
court
so
stated
in
bull
versus
united
states
and
to
construe
these
acts,
to
produce
that
result,
as
the
government
urges,
would
be
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
the
nature
of
the
action.
as
this
court
has
stated
in
numerous
times,
in
the
case
that's
cited
in
our
brief,
this
is
likened
to
an
action
of
assumption
--
general
assumption
of
the
common
law
where
the
court
is
concerned
with
the
abstract
justice
of
the
case.has
there
been
any
unjust
enrichment.
if
there
has
been,
then
it
is
immoral
to
retain
it
even
though
it
was
properly
collected
or
legally
collected
or
at
least
morally
collected
in
the
first
place.
and
dealing
with
the
tucker
act,
mr.
justice
holmes,
and
the
emery,
bird,
thayer,
realty
company
case
said
that
this
is
a
great
act
of
justice
and
it
should
not
be
construed
with
a
narrow
and
adverse
eye.
now
with
respect
to
those
reasons
why
a
taxpayer
may
not
go
to
the
tax
court,
taxpayers
are
frequently
called
upon
to
turn
square
corners
but
congress
for
the
last
80
years
or
more
has
made
every
effort
to
label
those
corners.
the
taxpayers
have
not
been
put
on
notice
that
if
they
failed
to
file
an
appeal
to
the
tax
court
and
thereafter,
find
themselves
unable
to
pay
an
assessment
which
they
consider
erroneous,
that
they
can
never
seek
to
recover
those
amounts
which
they
can
take.
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
facts
in
the
case
of
hanchett
versus
shaughnessy
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
there,
there
was
an
assessment
of
about
$10,000,
$700
or
$800.
the
taxpayer
paid
$4100.
he
filed
a
claim
for
refund.
it
was
promptly
rejected.
the
facts
there
show
that
he
had
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
director
where
he
would
pay
the
balance
of
that
assessment
at
$100
a
month
which
would
take,
with
interest,
about
six
years
to
pay
it
all.
under
the
government's
theory,
by
the
time
he
got
his
payments
completed
even
though
they
were
completely
erroneous,
he
would
have
fully
lost
his
right
to
recover
the
early
payments.
there
is
no
disturbance
of
the
ordinary
rules
of
procedure
in
a
case
of
this
sort.
the
director
can
proceed
to
distrain
if
the
taxpayer
is
thought
to
have
assets
that
he's
not
using
for
the
payment.
now,
mr.
stull
refers
to
the
fact
that
they
should
not
be
required
to
distrain.
they're
not
required
to
distrain
in
this
case
anymore
than
the
ordinary
case.
the
significance
of
these
great
powers
to
collect
is
the
taxpayers
voluntarily
pay
of
what
they
can
pay
and
there's
no
more
reason,
in
this
case
than
in
any
other
case,
to
assume
that
a
taxpayer
could
defeat
the
collection,
all
that
there
is
any
defeat
to
normal
procedures
of
collection
within
the
director's
office.
the
government
has
the
right,
also,
to
counterclaim
as
it
did
in
this
case
that
brings
before
the
court
all
the
issues
that
are
involved.
now,
mr.
stull
referred
to
the
fact
of
an
existing
practice
in
this
regard.
there's
nothing
to
support
that
except
the
fact
that
the
government
has
from
time
to
time
lost
cases
on
this
point.
they
lost
one
in
1940
and
another
in
1941.
the
issue
doesn't
seemed
to
have
arisen
again
until
around
1954
and
later
and
it
has
arisen
since
that
time
in
three
or
four
--
three,
i
believe,
excise
tax
cases
where
the
government
makes
the
same
arguments
that
is
made
here
relying
on
the
same
statute
except
for
the
fact
that
there,
the
taxpayer,
never
has
any
right
to
go
to
the
tax
court.
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
tax
court
is
a
relief
statute.
it
gives
to
the
taxpayer
the
opportunity
to
restrain
further
a
collection.
the
effect
of
failing
to
go
to
the
tax
court,
the
only
effect
is
that
the
taxpayer
has
lost
his
opportunity
to
restrain
collection
of
the
tax.
there's
nothing
that
was
in
that
relief
statute
or
in
its
history
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
deny
jurisdiction
to
the
court
to
entertain
a
claim
for
refund
of
taxes
that
are
alleged
to
be
excessive.
if
there
are
no
questions
from
the
court
that
concludes
the
argument
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
first
may
i
express
appreciation
of
the
petitioner
and
the
counsel
for
the
consideration
which
the
court
has
given
to
this
case?
we
do
believe
that
it
involved
very
fundamental
right
and
that
it
justifies
all
of
the
attention
that
has
been
given
to
it.
the
single
question
involved
here
is
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
to
recover
an
alleged
over
payment
of
tax.
the
facts
are
very
simple
and
they're
not
in
dispute.
the
taxpayer
filed
his
return
for
the
year
1950
and
he
paid
the
tax
shown
thereon.
thereafter,
the
commissioner
assessed
an
amount
of
$28,000
additional
tax
against
him.
after
notice
and
demand
the
taxpayer
in
1953
made
two
payments
totaling
approximately
$5000
and
brought
this
suit
to
recover
those
payments
after
rejection
of
his
claim
for
refund.
the
government
answered
denying
the
complaint
and
asserting
a
counterclaim
in
the
amount
of
$23,000
the
balance
of
the
assessment.
it
also
raised
the
special
defense
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
of
the
cause
of
action
because
the
total
amount
of
the
assessment
had
not
been
paid.
in
determining
whether
or
not,
the
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action,
the
allegations
of
facts
setout
in
the
complaint
must
of
course
be
assumed
to
be
true.
therefore,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
must
assume
that
the
amount
of
$5000
was
wrongfully
collected
from
the
taxpayer
and
necessarily
that
the
assertion
of
the
additional
claim
by
the
government
of
$23,000
was
likewise
wrongful.
the
issue
of
the
case
therefore
maybe
stated
thusly.
is
this
taxpayer
to
be
denied
the
right
to
recover
a
wrongful
collection
of
money
from
him
simply
because
the
government
at
the
time
is
pressing
an
illegal
claim
against
him
for
any
--
for
even
more
money?
now,
we
contend
that
jurisdiction
here
is
authorized
by
the
very
clear
provisions
of
section
1346
(a)
(1)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
commonly
referred
to
as
the
tucker
act
of
1887.
now,
this
court
has
concluded
and
this
is
not
been
denied
or
challenged
by
the
government,
that
on
the
face
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
this
suit
is
clearly
authorized.
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
lend
itself
to
a
construction
which
would
deny
jurisdiction.
if
the
government
is
to
prevail,
it
must
be
by
an
addendum
to
the
statute.
it
cannot
be
by
construction
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
such
clear
statutory
authorization,
we
submit,
should
be
sufficient
to
support
jurisdiction,
particularly
as
is
true
where
a
departure
from
the
statute
immediately
encounters
incongruities
and
hardships
to
the
taxpayer,
obviously
never
intended
by
congress.
if
this
position
should
be
upheld,
a
taxpayer
unable
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
an
assessment
could
never
recover
the
amounts
of
money
wrongfully
collected
from
him
under
an
illegal
assessment.
furthermore,
the
statute
of
limitations
for
--
for
bringing
his
suit
could
run
against
him
as
it
has
run
against
him
in
the
present
case
before
he
was
ever
able
to
complete
the
payment
of
the
entire
amount
of
the
illegal
assessment.
now,
recent
procedural
development
in
the
present
case,
not
shown
in
the
record
but
setout
in
our
brief,
provide
an
example
we
believe
of
the
succession
of
incongruities
which
were
reproduced
by
upholding
the
government's
position.
when
jurisdiction
was
denied
here
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
contends
to
rely
upon
its
assessment
which
had
all
the
effect
of
a
judgment
anyway,
withdrew
its
counterclaim.
now,
in
the
present
year,
may
of
1959,
the
government
has
brought
a
direct
action
against
the
taxpayer
in
the
same
district
court
asserting
the
same
claim
setout
originally
in
its
counterclaim.
now
nothing
has
been
produced
by
this
procedural
complexity
and
oddity
except
in
the
(inaudible)
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run
against
the
taxpayer's
claim
and
there
has
been
a
completely
unnecessary
delay
of
at
least
four
years
in
the
resolution
of
this
controversy
on
the
merits.
now
this
we
submit
is
just
the
beginning
of
the
procedural
oddities
which
will
be
produce
by
this
unnatural
and
unintended
restriction
on
jurisdiction
which
the
government
asserts
here.
now
we
cannot
believe
that
this
court
upon
reconsideration
can
be
led
to
depart
from
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
particularly
where
such
results
are
produced.
now
this
argument
as
i've
noted,
we
believe
should
be
sufficient,
within
itself
to
dispose
of
the
case,
but
there's
a
completely
different
approach
to
this
question,
which
is
equally
conclusive
and
which
requires
the
same
result.
in
the
government
latest
brief,
it
is
implicit
within
its
argument
that
it
cannot
possibly
prevail
here
unless
it
can
show
that
this
same
restriction,
the
so-called
“full
payment
restriction”
had
also
become
attached
to
the
traditional
right
to
sue
the
collector
in
personam
to
recover
moneys
wrongfully
collected
from
him.
in
fact,
the
government
argues
that
the
origin
of
its
rule
that
it
would
assert
here
arose
in
the
action
against
the
collector
and
was
merely
incorporated
by
implication
in
the
tucker
act
of
1887.
now,
it
is
clear
of
course,
that
a
--
at
common
law,
a
taxpayer
could
sue
a
collector
personally
to
recover
any
amount
of
money
wrongfully
taken
from
him
over
protest
without
regard
to
what
claims
the
government
or
the
crown
might
be
pressing
against
him.
this
the
government
will
admit.
to
prevail
therefore,
it
must
show
that
this
common
law
right
against
the
collector
somewhere,
somehow,
has
been
made
subject
to
this
unusual
restriction
which
it
urged.
now
this,
it
has
undertaken
to
do
in
its
latest
brief,
we
submit
with
total
failure.
now,
i
call
to
your
attention
that
what
it
does
argue
in
its
brief
is
that
in
the
customs
field,
a
statute
of
1839
by
requiring
the
collector
of
customs
to
make
prompt
payment
over
of
moneys
to
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
without
regard
to
protest
or
threat
of
litigation
had
taken
away
one
of
the
elements
of
the
common
law
right
against
the
collector
and
though
they
were
other
remedies
available
to
the
taxpayer,
he
could
no
longer
maintain
this
common
law
action.
this
court
so
held
that
in
cary
versus
curtis
in
1845.
within
five
weeks
of
that
decision,
congress
had
completed
the
enactment
of
a
statute
which
stated
expressly
that
nothing
in
the
statute
of
1839
should
be
construed
to
take
away
or
in
anyway
impair
this
right
of
action
against
the
collector.
yet
it
is
on
this
statute
of
1845
that
the
government
relies
as
originating
this
restriction
against
suit
against
the
collector.
i
might
add
that
that
argument
is
wrongly
made
without
reference
to
the
very
clear
language
of
that
statute
of
1845.
there
is
not
a
word,
or
a
suggestion,
or
a
hint
within
that
statute,
or
within
any
other
statute
that
the
government
has
cited
that
congress
has
ever
intended
in
anyway
such
as
argued
here
to
restrict
or
impair
or
narrow
the
scope
of
this
common
law
right
of
action
against
the
collector.
now,
we
believe
that
our
briefs
show
conclusively
that
in
1887
this
kind
of
a
suit
could
have
been
brought
against
the
collector,
that
was
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
tucker
act,
and
that
such
a
suit
could
be
brought
today
without
regard
to
what
claims
the
government
might
be
pressing
illegally
against
the
taxpayer.
i
am
sure
that
government
counsel
here
today
will
concede
that
if
such
a
suit
could
be
brought
in
1887
and
if
such
a
suit
could
be
brought
today,
there
could
exist
no
possible
reason
in
the
statute
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
for
attaching
this
restriction
in
a
suit
brought
against
the
united
states
under
the
tucker
act.
now
it
--
it
is
of
course,
not
possible
in
the
brief
time
that
i
have
here
to
discuss
all
of
the
reasons
that
have
been
proffered
by
the
government
to
this
court
for
departing
from
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
our
briefs
have,
i
believe,
shown
the
fallacy
of
each
legal
position
which
the
government
has
taken.
i
believe
also
our
briefs
have
discredited
the
nonlegal
representations
which
have
been
made
to
this
court,
first
as
to
consistent
and
long
existing
right
--
long
established
facts,
now
as
to
the
dire
of
threats
to
the
treasury
if
this
suit
is
upheld.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
to
reply
to
such
reasons
as
maybe
given
here
today
for
departing
from
that
statute.
i
do
hope
that
government
counsel
will
make
it
clear
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
relying
upon
a
construction
of
the
jurisdictional
statute.
and
if
so,
how
conceivably
can
that
statute
be
so
construed
and
if
it
is
not
relying
upon
a
construction
of
the
statute,
but
would
depart
from
the
statute,
what
conceivably
could
be
the
support
for
such
a
departure?
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
certain
that
your
honors
noted
the
government's
reliance
upon
taxpayer's
brief
to
show
the
immateriality
of
a
proposition
that
it
first
been
brought
in
by
the
government.
and
that
was
the
issue
of
practice
which
this
court
indicated
it
had
relied
heavily
upon
in
its
decision.
now,
the
government
when
our
petition
for
rehearing
was
first
filed
showed
a
great
deal
of
sensitivity
to
our
challenge
of
this
representation
of
fact
that
there
had
been
in
fact
a
long
existing
and
consistent
practice
and
i
think
we
showed
very
conclusively
that
it
did
not
exist.
we
showed
that
in
the
government's
brief
itself,
it
had
flatly
misstated
the
facts
of
important
cases
set
forth
at
the
critical
junction
in
its
brief,
that
it
had
so
confused
the
issue
as
to
disguise
the
real
fact
that
it
had
from
page
to
page
been
inconsistent
in
its
statement
of
what
its
practice
had
been,
and
yet
there
has
been
no
reply
whatsoever
to
this
proposition
into
our
explanation
of
the
real
practice
that
existed
and
this
court
was
to
that
extent
on
(inaudible)
know
that
faith
was
misled
as
to
what
the
practice
of
the
government
had
been.
because
during
the
1920s,
which
the
government
refers
to
as
a
very
important
formative
period,
this
particular
statute
was
amended
in
1921
to
put
into
the
jurisdictional
statute
clear
language
inconsistent
with
the
government's
position.
we
showed
that
in
1924
at
the
very
time
that
congress
first
considered
the
adoption
of
bta
provision,
the
commissioner
himself
in
a
bond
to
secure
the
balance
of
the
payment
of
an
assessment
had
required
a
taxpayer
to
bring
a
suit
to
recover
the
part
payment
that
had
been
made
on
the
assessment
in
the
detroit
trust
company
case.
and
that
15
years
later
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
briefs
that
approved
by
the
solicitor's
office,
the
government
was
arguing
that
the
taxpayer
couldn't
bring
his
suit
after
having
made
full
payment
because
he
had
not
conformed
with
the
condition
of
the
bond
and
brought
to
part
payment
suit.
we
also
showed
that
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
revenue
act
of
1926,
congress
recognized
that
suits
could
be
brought
without
paying
the
full
amount
asserted
by
the
government,
because
in
the
1926
act,
congress
provided
that
from
hereon
where
a
taxpayer
files
a
petition
in
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
he
can
no
longer
bring
his
suit
for
refund.
now,
that
didn't
just
incorporate
some
existing
law
as
the
government
would
argue
because
congress
said,
this
doesn't
apply
to
existing
cases
and
it
was
pointed
out
to
this
court
in
briefs
in
the
old
colony
trust
company
case
that
congress,
when
the
bta
provisions
were
adopted
recognized
that
there
were
many
cases
pending
in
the
tax
court
where
suits
for
refund
coming
in
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
where
suit
for
refunds
were
brought
in
the
district
court
or
where
taxpayers
were
planning
to
bring
such
suits.
it
shows
a
clear
recognition
of
(inaudible).
in
two
cases
in
this
court
in
1924
and
1926,
suits
were
brought
without
full
payment
and
yet,
despite
all
of
this,
the
government
argues
that
there
was
some
recognition
of
the
existence
of
this
rule
when
congress
adopted
the
bta
provisions.
now,
the
government
is
suggesting
that
these
elaborate
provisions
which
presented
an
alternative
remedy
under
which
the
restraint
could
be
obtained
pending
final
decision
that
these
elaborate
provisions
for
adopting
to
give
remedy
from
a
rule
that
never
had
existed.
now
these
cases
are
very
infrequent.
we
have
pointed
out
that
they
can
have
any
practical
significance
at
all
until
you
get
to
the
case
where
a
taxpayer
is
faced
with
an
assessment
he
cannot
pay.
in
its
long
and
extensive
memorandum
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
i
mean
the
petition
for
rehearing,
the
government
acknowledged
that
even
if
the
taxpayer's
file
was
able
to
complete
the
payment
of
the
tax
after
bringing
his
suit,
jurisdiction
would
still
lie.
it's
only
the
fellow
who
can
never
pay
that
has
the
horrible
imposition
put
upon
him
by
this
rule,
that
he
can
never
go
into
a
court
of
law
and
test
his
right
to
recover
moneys
which
he
thinks
have
been
wrongfully
collected
from
him.
now,
having
brought
in
the
representation
about
practice
and
having
relied
on
our
brief
to
take
it
out
again,
the
government
has
now
brought
in
a
representation
of
policy,
of
--
of
threat
to
the
treasury.
there
has
been
no
showing
whatsoever
to
support
such
a
representation.
it
certainly
is
not
true
as
a
legal
proposition.
there
is
no
restraint
whether
or
not
suit
is
filed
to
recover
payments
that
are
made.
a
taxpayer
who
makes
his
payments,
he
can't
run
right
in
the
court.
he's
gotten
his
notice
and
demand.
he's
compelled
by
any
other
taxpayer
to
meet
that
notice
in
demand.
if
he
makes
a
payment
of
all
he
can,
he
must
then
file
a
claim
for
refund.
he
must
wait
six
months
unless
the
commissioner
acts
in
the
meantime
and
then
bring
his
suit.
now
the
mere
fact
that
he
may
file
his
suit
doesn't
cause
the
collector
to
stand
back
and
say
and
refrain
from
saying,
“pay
up”
as
he
would
to
any
other
taxpayers.
the
government
recognizes
that
the
fact
that
the
suit
is
filed
doesn't
compel
the
collector
to
stand
back
and
refrain
from
saying
“pay
up”.
we
submit
that
it's
utterly
ridiculous
to
say
that
the
mere
prospect
of
filing
the
suit
or
the
filing
of
the
suit
forces
a
collector
to
come
in
and
levy
on
a
man
home
and
sell
him.
somehow
he's
trying
to
--
the
government
is
trying
to
put
this
group
of
taxpayers
into
a
special
case,
class
of
tax
evaders
or
avoiders,
who
are
never
going
to
meet
their
--
the
demand
unless
the
collector
comes
out
and
sells
their
home.
there
isn't
any
basis
here,
and
if
i
may
suggest
that
that's
not
the
sort
of
an
inquiry
that
a
court
is
prepared
or
equipped
to
look
into
and
search
into.
i
can't
conceive
that
such
a
proposition
would
ever
be
made
to
the
searching
inquiry
of
the
expert
on
the
staff
of
the
committees
of
congress.
if
it
did
represent
any
kind
of
a
threat,
now
i
might
say
this
is
same
(inaudible)
was
made
in
the
sirian
lamp
case
18
years
ago
and
absolutely
no
threat
has
occurred.
i
might
point
out
to
you
that
immediately
after
making
--
it
--
it
--
most
exhaustive
obviously
--
the
most
exhaustive
examination
of
all
of
these
cases
in
writing
125
briefs
--
page
brief
on
this
subject
the
most
that
the
government
could
suggest
in
the
way
of
a
threat
to
the
treasury
was
that
if
the
taxpayer
finally
prevailed
on
the
merits
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
district
court,
or
the
court
of
claims,
which
would
be
at
least
a
year-and-a-half
or
two
years
or
more
after
the
notice
in
demand,
but
the
only
threat
would
be
that
if
he
got
a
favorable
judgment
below,
the
government
might
not
want
to
try
to
collect
the
balance
of
the
tax
even
if
the
fellow
could
pay
it
pending
appeal
which
would
be
simply
a
voluntary
decision
and
it
could
hardly
present
any
great
threat
to
the
treasury
of
our
united
states
government.
the
complete
(inaudible)
of
this
proposition
that's
now
being
urged
before
the
court
is
nonlegal
proposition
as
a
substitute
for
the
other
nonlegal
proposition
that
they've
carried
out
is
in
the
fact
that
the
government
urges
that
the
taxpayer
where
he
can
ought
to
appeal
to
the
tax
court
and
there
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
anything
and
millions
and
millions,
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
are
restrained
legally
there
as
compared
to
the
very
few
cases
that
will
arise
on
this
problem
where
a
taxpayer
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
is
subject
to
assessment
and
he
does
not
have
the
benefit
of
restraint
upon
the
commissioner's
powers
to
collect.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
i
don't
--
i
would
think
of
a
much
larger
proportion
if
you
included
the
tucker
act
cases
and
the
collector's
cases
together.
i
believe
there
are
about
a
total
of
2000
in
the
district
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
in
the
district
courts
and
the
court
of
claims
and
probably
six
times,
five
or
six
times
as
many
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
i
don't
have
any
figure.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
figures
on
this.
i
will
call
to
your
honors'
attention
that
the
greatest
number
of
cases
filed
involving
this
kind
of
a
suit
under
the
--
i
may
say
so
what
we
consider
the
exaggerated
claims
of
the
government,
the
most
filed
in
any
12-month
period
were
11
as
compared
in
that
same
fiscal
period
approximately
11,000
petitions
filed
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government
has
here
undertaken
to
pick
up
a
slogan
which
paid
for
it's
litigate
layer
and
instead
of
seeking
construction
of
a
statute,
he's
seeking
construction
of
a
slogan.
now,
that
is
an
easy
and
popular
expression
which
means
simply
that
a
taxpayer
cannot
restrain
the
collection
of
a
tax.
he
can't
get
an
injunction
and
therefore,
the
merits
can't
be
determined
on
an
injunctive
action.
he
must
pay
and
sue
to
recover,
in
all
of
these
cases.
cheatham
and
all
of
the
other
cases
not
a
single
one
of
them
makes
the
slightest
reference
to
the
particular
question
raised
here
as
to
whether
when
he
does
sue
to
recover
an
amount
that
he
has
paid,
there's
any
loss
of
jurisdiction
because
he
has
not
been
able
to
pay
the
entire
amount
of
the
government's
claim.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
no,
it
has
not.
if
i
may
say
it
to
the
court,
i
think
perhaps
it
might
be
a
concern
to
the
congress
but
it
was
well
known
that
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
being
filed.
now,
does
that
satisfy
your
honor?
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
me
a
question
about
whether
congress
had
codified
the
statutory
--
the
common
law
action
against
the
collector.
perhaps
the
statute
of
1845
can
be
treated
as
a
codification
of
that
action.
i
noted
that
the
counsel
in
arguments
still
has
never
referred
to
the
language
of
the
statute
upon
which
it
relies
to
restrict
and
attach
this
condition
as
restricting
and
attaching
this
condition
to
the
action
against
the
collector.
that
language
is
set
out
on
page
9
of
our
reply
brief
is
that
nothing
in
the
1839
act
shall
take
away
or
be
construed
to
take
away
or
impair
the
right
of
any
person
or
persons
who
have
paid
or
shall
hereafter
pay
money
as
and
of
duties
to
maintain
any
action
at
law
against
such
collector
and
they
have
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
touching
the
same
according
to
the
due
course
of
law.
i
want
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that
in
referring
to
what
the
government
calls
functionally
related
statute
it
has
avoided
altogether
any
reference
to
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
in
1924
congress,
to
clarify
the
statute
of
limitation,
adopted
a
provision
which
said
as
each
payment
of
tax
is
made,
the
statute
of
limitations
on
claiming
a
refund
shall
begin
to
run
then
and
the
senate
finance
committee
report
pertaining
to
that
provision
said
that
it
was
done
in
order
to
make
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
coincide
with
the
accrual
of
the
cause
of
action.
those
are
the
very
same
words
which
the
solicitor
general
made
to
this
court
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
1934
in
the
clark
case
which
we
have
pointed
out
when
he
was
arguing
that
with
respect
to
a
state
tax
statute
which
congress
had
failed
to
clarify.
he
was
arguing
the
general
proposition
that
the
cause
of
action
clearly
approves
when
each
separate
payment
is
made
just
as
we're
arguing
in
this
case.
and
that
therefore
the
statute
of
limitations
on
a
state
tax
should
accrue
at
that
particular
time.
we
believe
your
honors,
as
i
have
said
that
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
supports
this
action.
that
language
was
put
into
the
statute
in
1921.
we
don't
say
that
that
language
created
the
right.
the
right
had
always
existed.
it
was
equally
clear
under
the
original
tucker
act
of
1887.
it
was
clear
in
suits
against
the
collector
prior
to
that
time
subsequent
to
the
1845
act.
it
was
perfectly
clear
at
common
law
what
we
say
is
that
congress
in
1921
could
not
have
used
this
very
clear
language
of
the
statute
if
it
had
recognized
the
existence
of
any
such
rule
and
if
it
had
attended
--
intended
to
attach
any
such
restriction.
thank
you
your
honors.
