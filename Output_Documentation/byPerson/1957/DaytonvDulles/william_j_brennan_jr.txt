the
secretary
to
allege
the
petitioner's
testimony
alongside
of
the
three
witnesses
and
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
must
be
the
one
who
felt
the
credibility?

dr.
dayton.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

would
that
mean,
mr.
solicitor
that
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
this
whole
case
can
stand
on
finding
v?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
i
understand
it
though,
finding
5,
his
basics
entirely
on
the
disclosure
which
might
put
this
to
conduct
with
united
states
foreign
relations.
and
we're
told
nothing
apparently
other
than
that
--
based
upon
it.
and
the
secretary
was
satisfied
that
the
fact
they
was
denying
him
abroad
to
engage
in
activities
advancing
the
communist
movement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
--
you
don't
suggest
that
independently
as
any
other
findings,
the
secretary's
decision
can
rest
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
gather
in
this
case,
but
i
thought
your
suggestion
to
mr.
justice
harlan
was
that
where
reliance
is
upon
confidential
information
because
of
its
relation
of
the
conduct
to
foreign
affairs
that
this
action
might
be
taken
without
any
disclosure
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
--
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
let's
--
let's
suppose
that
was
the
only
planning
we
had
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
pin
it
down
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
nothing
whatever
except
what's
involved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
in
this
instance,
i
gather
the
government
concedes,
we
are
dealing
with
a
constitutionally
protected
individual
right
to
travel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
if
that
--
and
let's
assume
your
premise
is
sound,
relates
to
foreign
relation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
extend
to
the
point
of
not
telling
him
how
when
he
says
he
has
found
that
dr.dayton
is
going
abroad
to
engage
in
activities
which
will
advance
the
movement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
better
please
not
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
hasn't
said
of
course,
at
least
he
doesn't
relate.
he's
not
telling
how
to
foreign
relations
as
i
read
this
conclusion.
and
perhaps
that's
intended,
i
don't
know.
it
doesn't
seem
to
read
that
way.
it
seems
to
make
the
--
the
general
conclusion,
and
that's
all,
and
relate
only
the
confidential
information
in
the
field
of
foreign
relation.
there
was
reason
why
he's
not
disclosing
what
the
information
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
think
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
would
suppose
--
i
would
suppose
you're
right.
if
you're
right
in
your
major
premise,
you
would
be
right
as
to
that.
