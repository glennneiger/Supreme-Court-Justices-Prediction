mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
problems
in
this
case
are
obviously
more
difficult
than
the
other
two
for
the
government.
we
believe
that
this
case,
the
court
will
have
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
action
taken
concerning
the
petitioner
if
it
gets
beyond
the
problem
of
whether
the
statutes
authorize
the
action
of
the
secretary
if
his
regulations
were
proper
and
so
forth.
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
placed
the
reliance
that
he
did
upon
the
three
witnesses
as
to
the
activities
of
the
petitioner
in
65
morton
street
where
the
espionage
activities
of
rosenberg
took
place.
it's
important
to
examine
that
factor
of
this
case
and
what
bearing
it
might
have
on
the
findings
in
decision
of
the
secretary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
did
and
i
assume
that
he
did
not.
i
--
i
think
it
was
done
on
examining
this
record
as
a
cold
record
before
him.
the
board
of
passport
appeals
had
the
hearing
at
which
they
went
especially
to
new
york
as
i
understand
and
took
this
testimony
of
these
three
witnesses
and
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
my
interpretation
of
the
record
and
i
--
i
--
looking
at
the
cold
record,
i
do
not
think
it's
difficult
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
it's
the
showing
of
three
people
who,
after
three
hours
of
cross
examination
by
the
petitioner's
counsel.
they're
unable
to
shake
as
to
the
solid
merits
of
their
testimony
about
having
seen
the
petitioner
at
this
particular
place
during
the
times
described.
and
there
was
no
motivation
of
any
kind
shown
that
these
people
would
have
for
claiming
that
they've
seen
this
man
at
that
point
as
they
did,
so
that
it's
just
a
clear
cut
denial
on
the
one
side
and
a
definitive
description
of
the
petitioner's
presence
and
the
very
close
observation
by
these
three
people
at
several
different
times
to
this
important
place.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
did
this
occur?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
occurred
five
years
before
this
hearing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
they
had
reported
it
to
the
fbi
and
had
identified
a
photograph
of
the
petitioner
within
a
period
of
six
or
seven
months
and
had
pointed
--
had
been
taken
to
the
new
york
airport
and
identified
him
specifically
there
within
a
period
of
six
to
eight
months
after
the
event.
so
this
was
a
reaffirmation
of
observation
of
--
and
statements
that
they'd
made
before
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
rosenberg
is
not
--
is
related
to
the
building,
but
not
to
the
petitioner
in
any
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
the
other
people
as
i
know,
as
far
as
i
know,
have
not
been
prosecuted.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
within
three
or
four
days
or
a
week
of
the
time
that
he
was
being
asked
about
his
activities.
this
mr.
sarant
fled
to
mexico
and
as
far
as
the
record
show,
has
been
there
since.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
she
went
with
--
according
to
the
testimony.
and
the
problem
--
i
think
that
it
is
clear
in
the
record
what
the
secretary
had
to
consider
about
credibility
here,
the
further
factors.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
petitioners.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
fact
that
sarant
live
next
door
at
ithaca
to
the
petitioner
and
they
built
houses
adjacent
--
adjacent
to
each
other
and
it
was
a
very
close
relationship
in
that
regard
because
the
petitioner
was
--
apparently
had
done
some
building
before
and
knew
how
to
build
houses
and
sarant
consulted
with
him
over
a
considerable
period
over
a
year
and
a
half
about
various
building
problems
he
had.
and
it's
apparent
from
that
testimony
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
very
close
relationship
and
back
and
forth.
then,
you
have
the
additional
factor
that
sarant
and
his
wife
lived
with
the
petitioner
in
their
home
for
a
period
of
eight
months
together
during
the
time
that
a
lot
of
the
activities
in
65
morton
street
were
supposed
to
be
going
on
according
to
the
rosenberg
case.
now,
it's
the
question
of
what
inferences
a
person
who
were
judging
facts
would
ordinarily
draw
from
those
relationships,
and
the
fact
that
sarant
was
supposed
to
have
been
going
down
to
this
place,
65
morton
street,
during
this
period
of
time.
and
what
he
might
have
been
able
to
know
and
probably
knew
that
he
claimed
he
knew
nothing
about
this
place
was
never
there
and
these
people
identified
him.
so,
it's
--
that
difference
in
the
testimony
and
once
had,
categorical
denial,
it
could
have
been
a
mistaken
identity,
nobody
can
disapprove
otherwise.
but
the
whole
situation
was
such
that
apparently,
the
finder
in
this
situation
consistently
held
against
the
petitioner
in
regard
to
it
and
it
has
the
definite
bearing
on
everything
else
that
he
testified
to
in
regard
to
his
claims
about
his
activities.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
advised
that
it
is
now
a
standing
board,
but
has
in
the
past
been
ad
hoc.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
--
the
bernard
peters.
that
is
alleged
to
be
a
communist
according
to
this
confidential
information.
that
is
the
man
in
--
at
the
tata
institute
in
india
that
this
petitioner
is
going
to
see
and
participate
in
his
research
with
and
that
is
another
factor
in
the
apparent
judgment
of
the
secretary
that
there
might
be
a
serious
damage
to
the
united
states
in
regard
to
possibility
of
espionage
and
subversive
activity.
now,
this
--
there's
no
question
in
this
record
that
this
petitioner
is
a
skilled
man
in
the
field
of
physics,
nuclear
physics
and
so
forth.
he
has
great
knowledge
of
it.
bernard
peters
is
one
of
the
leading
authorities
on
cosmic
ray.
it's
also
unquestioned
that
there's
a
close
relationship
between
the
information
in
the
field
of
cosmic
ray
and
the
general
nuclear
physics
field.
i
don't
--
the
record
is
clear
according
to
the
testimony
that
the
cosmic
ray
information
is
generally
not
a
confidential
or
classified
information.
but
it's
quite
apparent
from
the
testimony
of
another
physicist
that
it's
readily
transferable
from
one
field
to
the
other
as
far
as
use
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
government's
view,
the
secretary
could
properly
base
his
--
in
his
judgment
entirely
on
the
--
the
confidential
information
and
he'd
have
to
follow
the
regulations
about
the
application
and
the
information
to
furnish
for
that
character
because
asked
--
having
asked
for
according
to
holdings
of
this
court,
he
would
have
to
follow
it
through
on,
but
he
could
decide
that
he
didn't
believe
that
if
there
was
a
basis
in
the
record
for
his
non-belief
and
could
then
address
himself
to
the
confidential
information.
now,
when
i
say
that
confidential
information
in
that
regard,
i
would
say
that
it's
easier
to
come
to
that
conclusion
as
to
confidential
information
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs
where
i
think
that
the
privilege
of
withholding
that
information
has
to
be
absolute
in
accordance
with
our
history
because
i
think
if
you
start
trying
to
tell
what
might
be
involved
in
regard
to
peters
or
other
things
that
you
could
imagine
that
a
responsible
person,
i
think
were
entitled
to
assume
that
the
secretary
was
acting
responsibly
here,
would
have
that
he
would
consider
would
seriously
affect
our
foreign
affairs.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
you
have
other
problems
and
that
they're
beyond
that.
i
think
the
government
does.
i
think
that
we
are
or
have
before
the
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that
is
true.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
also
have
the
problem
of
his
picking
out
the
other
parts
of
his
decision
in
which
he
said
he
did
not
rely
on
that,
that
he
relied
on
other
confidential
information
which
was
--
we
conceived
was
the
fbi
reports.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
other
findings
to
the
extent
that
they're
not
connected
with
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
i
think
i
still
have
to
have
the
caveat
that
if
there
were
other
things
in
the
application,
they
would
have
to
be
taken
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
take
that
out
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
i
think
that
if
the
secretary
of
state
in
united
states
said
that
in
the
interest
of
protecting
the
foreign
affairs
of
the
united
states,
that
it
would
been
damaging
and
tell
as
much
as
he
could
but
if
he
couldn't
tell
anymore
than
that
that
the
interest
of
the
country
or
such
that
the
individual
right
have
to
give
away
to
that
extent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'd
like
to
single
out
in
my
answer
that
he
can
solely
on
the
grounds
of
confidential
information
relating
to
foreign
affairs.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
court's
could
require
that
he
say
whether
he
related
to
foreign
affairs
because
i
think
they're
different
problems
for
the
courts
in
regard
to
the
confidential
material
if
it
is
regarding
--
properly
regarding
foreign
affairs
than
if
it's
in
--
in
other
areas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
think
that
he
would
--
traditionally,
you
never
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
--
well,
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
responsible
officers
of
that
level
in
the
government
act
responsibly.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
without
review.
i
was
just
trying
to
make
the
distinction
that
you
would
have
the
right
to
know
that
it
was
related
to
foreign
affairs
where
the
conflict
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
that
in
his
opinion,
it
would
injure
--
seriously
injure
the
foreign
relation
of
the
united
states.
now,
he
is
the
person
that
under
our
system
of
government,
we
give
the
responsibility
to
conduct
the
foreign
affairs.
and
we
trust
him
with
much
more
than
that
everyday
in
handling
our
various
problems
on
behalf
of
all
of
us
in
regard
to
foreign
affairs,
not
only
this
petitioner
but
the
whole
country.
and
i
think
that
this
court
in
the
past
has
respected
the
action
of
the
present
--
or
the
secretary
of
state
when
they
were
acting
in
that
area
and
gave
that
as
the
reason.
and
i
would
assume
that
you
had
the
right
to
expect
that
the
secretary
of
state
would
never
do
that
unless
he
was
certain
that
it
was
something
that
was
serious
in
relation
to
this
important
right
that
was
being
at
least
reduced
and
possibly
taken
away
the
cause.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
in
many
areas,
you
permit
--
this
court
is
permitted
constitutionally
protected
rights
to
be
limited
to
such
--
to
some
extent
as
compared
with
balancing
the
interest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
anything
except
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
where
it's
been
a
traditional,
most
--
from
washington's
time
on.
and
as
i
recall
where
he
did
not
disclose
certain
information
to
the
senate
in
connection
with
some
foreign
affairs
matters
because
he
didn't
think
that
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
only
in
this
regard
that
--
that
sometimes,
the
individual
asked
--
right
has
to
give
way
to
the
interest
of
the
whole
community
if
it's
important
enough
that
he
have
--
has
to
give
a
way.
and
in
the
form
of
--
various
field,
it's
possible
that
information
that
he
might
have
might
precipitate
us
into
war.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that's
true
in
this
particular
case
but
it
could
be.
in
history
--
history
reveals
cases
for
various
serious
matters
of
--
have
been
caused
by
revealing
something
that
shouldn't
have
been
disclosed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
that
this
--
this
problem
has
on
it
the
gloss
of
the
interest
of
the
whole
united
states
to
have
foreign
affairs
properly
conducted
and
not
have
matters
revealed
that
are
going
to
hurt
us
all.
and
that
if
it
should
injure
this
very
important
right
of
an
individual
to
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
nevertheless,
that
for
the
interest
of
us
all,
that
right
has
to
give
a
way
if
it's'
necessary
to
protect
the
whole
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
one
that
would
provide
for
just
absolute
discretion
without
regard
to
confidential
information
of
foreign
affairs.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
i'd
have
to
say
yes,
they
could
pass
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
let
me
try
to
make
it
plain
that
--
what
i
think
is
the
difference.
i
think
that
for
the
secretary
to
have
an
absolute
discretion
that
regardless
of
what
he
happens
to
think
about
anything,
he
can
take
my
constitutional
right
away,
is
something
that
congress
cannot
empower
him
to
do.
but
if
in
the
exercise
of
his
judgment
as
the
top
official
under
the
president
in
foreign
affairs,
he
thinks
that
to
reveal
something
would
injure
the
welfare
of
the
united
states
in
foreign
affairs
to
such
an
extent
that
he
can't
reveal
it.
and
i'd
say
that
my
rights
got
to
give
way
in
order
to
protect
the
interest
of
all
of
us.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
follows
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
have
that
information
to
do
it.
now,
there
may
be
many
other
factors
that
might
contribute
in
the
ordinary
case
to
whether
you
could
get
your
passport
anyway.
but
if
you
finally
get
down
to
the
point
that
you
either
get
that
information
or
you
lose
your
right
to
get
your
passport
and
travel,
then
i
think
that
in
the
balance
of
the
interest
of
all
the
people
of
the
country
as
against
the
interest
of
one
person
who
wants
the
right
to
travel,
it
has
to
give
way.
i
think
we
do
that.
the
courts
so
declared
in
good
many
different
areas
about
war
power
and
other
things
that
we
--
we
just
happen
to
give
way
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
community.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
appreciate
that,
that
it's
something
that
--
it's
just
not
this
petitioner
and
i
respect
--
mean
to
respect
this
petitioner's
rights
too.
it
is
denial
to
americans
generally
if
they
have
to
give
way
in
order
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
whole
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
very
difficult
too
that
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
i
concede
that.
but
if
you
still
--
how
--
i'm
in
a
difficult
position
that
i
don't
know
what
the
secretary
has
either
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
i
--
[laughter]
i
have
any
more
right
to
find
out
than
anybody
else
if
it
--
if
it
would
hurt
the
country.
so,
i
could
imagine
various
things
that
would
--
the
mere
telling
how
would
tell
the
whole
story
and
cause
an
international
list.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
if
it
was
a
--
i
would
not
see
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
court
saying,
“well,
how?”
and
he
come
back,
but
i
do
think
that
you
--
the
door
should
be
closed
if
he
would
come
back
and
say
for
me
to
say
that
would
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
seriously
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
don't
find
that
he
--
he
has
answered
that
question.
the
court
might
proceed
that,
require
him
to
do
so.
i
think
the
problem
in
regard
to
confidential
information
of
the
fbi
as
i've
indicated
is
a
different
problem,
and
a
more
difficult
problem
for
the
government.
it's
a
question
of
protecting
the
sources
of
information
and
the
conduct
of
intelligence.
now,
those
persons
who
examine
the
question
are
responsible
people,
it
seems
to
me.
the
committee
on
the
security
and
the
government
had
made
their
report
in
which
they
indicate
that
there
should
be
as
much
disclosure
as
possible.
and
professor
jaffe
has
indicated
that
its
probably
a
ground
for
withholding
an
order
to
protect
the
intelligence
system
of
a
country
so
it
can
be
able
to
carry
on
and
get
the
necessary
information
that
it
has
to.
and
there
are
other
responsible
groups,
association
of
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york
examining
to
this
question
carefully
and
they
came
up
with
the
same
suggestion
that
if
the
disclosure
should
go
as
far
as
it
--
it
can
be
made.
but
there
--
there's
probably
an
area
that
has
to
be
withheld
in
order
to
protect
the
greater
interest.
and
i
think
that's
the
matter
which
we
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i'll
leave
it
there
except
with
the
suggestion
that
parker
against
lester,
that's
referred
to
by
counsel,
is
quite
a
different
case
than
this
case.
and
that
here,
the
substance
of
the
various
matters
involved
the
confidential
information
except
to
form
theories
was
made
known
to
the
petitioner
and
the
record
shows
that
he
had
addressed
himself
to
all
of
that
material
and
he
tried
to
--
to
answer
if
--
and
he
frankly
admitted
some
parts
of
the
information
that
was
available
and
tried
to
explain
in
a
way.
so
everything
that
was
involved
in
that
type
of
information,
we
think
he
was
not
damaged
by
no
further
disclosure
and
that
he
had
chance
to
cross-examine
in
regard
to
these
others.
but
in
parker
against
lester
if
you
recall,
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
they
--
they
took
away
the
license
of
the
seaman
to
continue
in
their
--
their
occupation
by
which
they
made
their
livelihood
without
any
hearing
of
any
kind
and
then
proceeded
to
--
in
using
this
confidential
information.
and
that's
quite
different
from
the
elaborate
proceedings
that
have
been
held
in
this
case
and
making
a
substance
of
the
information
available
and
what
we
think
is
as
much
as
could
be
and
still
protect
the
source
of
information
in
the
intelligence
system.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
thank
you
chief
justice.
