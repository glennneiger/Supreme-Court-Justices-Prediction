justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rand,
may
i
trouble
you
to
state
again.
i
think
you
did
precisely
what
--
the
directions
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
on
remand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
perhaps
i'm
anticipating
--
is
what
the
secretary
did
under
--
on
the
date
that
is
correct,
october
4,
1956,
is
what
he
did
in
conformity
of
what
he
was
directed
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you,
mr.
rand,
it
went
back
to
him
and
on
the
basis
of
--
of
the
record
which
is
to
inspect
by
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
then
complied
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
told
him
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
it
goes
back
to
the
--
went
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there,
you
--
you
challenged
the
justification
of
his
findings
under
the
statute,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
do
his
findings
shed
any
light
on
that
question
whether
he
did
or
didn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
other
than
what
happened
before
and
when
you
were
before
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
in
addition
to
the
record
that
was
made
out
originally
for
all
you
know
and
did
you
say
you
do
know,
he
considered
additional
matters
which
were
not
put
into
your
disposal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
when
you
protest
against
which
you
want
to
impose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
question
was,
do
his
findings
--
his
findings
neutral
on
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
political
--
the
political
ground
being
membership,
well,
he
has
denied
that
he
is
a
member
of
a
political
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
this
is
different
from
the
preceding
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
there
is
a
disavow
of
membership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
you
saying
that
even
if
--
if
you
are
a
--
agreed,
conceded
that
even
if
it
were
admitted.
that's
what
he
went
for
but
that's
beyond
(a)
the
grand
of
statutory
call
and
(b)
beyond
this
constitutional
power
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
you
urging
that
that
finding
was
made
without
an
opportunity
on
your
part,
procedure
to
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
are
you
saying
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
speaking
as
unequivocally
as
it
can
may
not
constitutionally
say
the
director
of
the
secretary
of
the
state
not
to
grant
a
passport,
not
to
be
at
least
to
leave
the
country
to
a
person
who
says,
â€œi'm
going
to
x
country
to
promote
the
cause
of
the
communist
party."
are
you
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
do
mean
by
the
standards?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
said
--
in
use
of
term
that
i've
just
used
roughly,
in
answer,
you
find
out
the
fact
and
if
you
find
the
fact
which
convince
you
giving
up
to
his
--
for
hearing
and
arrest
that
john
smith
wants
to
go
to
india
or
pakistan
or
anywhere
else
that
you
well
on,
wherever
he
goes
to
promote
the
cause
of
the
communist
party,
will
not
be
given
a
passport,
you
would
say
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
assuming
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
secretary
state
explicitly
why
he
withholds
disclosure
of
what
--
of
the
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
their
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
278?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
imagine
though,
mr.
rand,
that
you
ought
to
feel
that
your
client
suffered
because
you
make
him
out
more
of
a
candid
person
than
he
otherwise
would
have
appeared.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
--
excuse
me.
may
i
ask
you
what
is
implied
by
judge
fay
position
in
case
here
prevail
among
his
brethrens
in
the
court
and
the
case
was
sent
back
as
he
wanted
it
sent
back
finding
inadequacy
both
in
the
regulations
and
in
the
confidential.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
--
that's
the
reason
why
i'm
asking,
i'm
not
clear.
would
you
define,
stating
what
you
understand
to
be
what
one
would
do
if
one
agreed
with
judge
fay's
conclusions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
say
that
he
bought
confidential
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
information
but
i
was
wondering
whether
it
is
an
implied
anything
that
he
finds
both
the
finding
unsatisfactory
and
the
regulations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
sufficiently
commanding
or
to
giving
too
much
scope
to
the
secretary
because
--
did
i
or
didn't
i
understand
you
that
the
secretary
doesn't
even
state
on
convincing
as
it
can
be
convincing
to
grounds
why
he
doesn't
want
to
withhold
it
except
in
the
most
general
terms.
you
did
say
that,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
you
say
that
he
doesn't
--
here
didn't
--
i
think
--
it
think
hear
you
say
that
he
doesn't
even
indicate
why
--
what
--
what
embarrassment
would
come
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you
to
say
that
voguish
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
those
words
but
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
indicated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
--
i
want
to
know
--
i
want
to
know.
this
board
of
appeal
in
the
department,
is
that
standing
board
or
an
ad
hoc,
that
is
this
board
constituted
with
reference
to
particular
cases
or
is
that
a
permanent
administrative
appeal
board
within
the
state
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
he
must
testify
explicitly
on
that
ground
is
what
you're
saying?
