mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
preceding
case
involves
the
denial
of
a
passport
by
the
secretary
of
state
under
section
51.135
of
this
passport
regulations.
unlike
the
previous
case
however,
in
this
case,
petitioner
has
filed
an
affidavit
stating
that
he
was
never
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
has
exhausted
all
the
steps
in
the
administered
proceeding
in
the
department
of
state
and
nevertheless,
more
than
four
years
after,
the
application
was
filed,
he
still
stands
here
today
by
his
counsel
deprived
of
a
passport
and
therefore
barred
under
the
presently
effective
provisions
of
law
from
travel
abroad.
the
petition
here,
dr.
weldon
bruce
dayton
is
a
physicist
by
education
and
training.
he's
a
native-born
american
citizen,
born
--
post
and
just
a
bit
more
than
40
years
ago.
his
specialty
in
physics
as
a
result
of
his
training
has
been
on
the
field
of
cosmic
ray
physical
research.
the
field
that
as
i
understand
it,
deals
with
researches
in
the
elementary
particles
of
matter
and
which
as
the
record
discloses
without
dispute,
is
completely
non-classified,
is
completely
without
secrecy.
on
march
5,
1954,
petitioner
filed
an
application
with
department
of
state
to
enable
him
to
travel
to
india
where
he
had
been
offered
an
appointment
of
the
tata
institute
of
fundamental
research
in
bombay.
the
tata
institute
is
a
well-renowned
educational
institution
attached
and
affiliated
with
the
university
of
bombay.
advised
by
the
director
of
the
passport
office
that
a
passport
would
be
refused
to
him
because
its
issuance
would
be
contrary
to
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states.
petitioner
immediately
sought
an
informal
conference
in
the
passport
office
and
at
that
conference,
petitioner
and
i
as
his
council
attended.
petitioner
was
interrogated,
asked
numerous
questions
by
an
official
of
the
passport
office,
he
answered
all
those
questions.
the
official
then
suggested
that
the
petitioner
file
an
affidavit
in
which
he
would
embody
the
answers
of
those
questions.
and
so,
petitioner
prepared
a
comprehensive
22-paged,
single-spaced,
typewritten
affidavit
in
which
he
set
forth
the
details
in
which
he
thought
the
passport
office
would
be
interested.
that
affidavit
appears
at
pages
10-42
of
the
record.
and
in
that
affidavit,
at
page
12
of
the
record,
petitioner
averred
the
record
as
this
very
large
joint
appendix,
your
honors.
i'm
sorry,
we
had
to
impose
that
on
you
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
print
the
record
in
this
case.
at
page
12
of
the
record,
your
honors
will
find
the
petitioner
averred
among
other
things
in
this
affidavit
as
follows.
“i
am
not
now
and
i've
never
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
with
a
possible
exception
of
a
casual
and
brief
association
with
the
work
of
the
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee
for
a
few
months
in
1941
and
the
1942,
i
am
not
now
and
never
have
been
a
member
of
any
of
the
organizations
designated
on
the
attorney
general's
list
which
i
have
carefully
examined.
i
am
not
now
engaged
and
i
have
never
engaged
in
any
activities
which
so
far
as
i
know
or
at
any
time
knew,
support
or
supported
the
communist
movement.
i
wish
to
go
abroad
for
the
sole
purpose
of
engaging
in
experimental
research
at
the
tata
institute
of
fundamental
research
in
bombay.
i
am
not
going
abroad
to
engage
in
any
activities
which
so
far
as
i
know
or
can
imagine
will
in
any
way
advance
to
communist
movement.”
notwithstanding
this
lengthy
affidavit,
the
passport
office
persisted
in
his
denial
of
a
passport,
and
so
petitioner,
in
accordance
with
the
passport
regulations,
appealed
to
board
of
passport
appeals
of
the
department
of
state.
several
hearings
were
held
before
that
board.
the
testimony
adduced
that
those
hearings
both
from
petitioner
and
dr.
corson,
a
professor
of
physics
at
cornell
university
whom
he
called
and
three
witnesses
from
the
board,
called
with
respect
to
a
single
aspect
with
the
charges
against
petitioner.
all
their
testimony
is
set
forth
in
the
record
beginning
with
page
58
and
continuing
perhaps
ad
nauseam
until
page
270
of
this
record.
at
the
beginning
of
these
hearings
before
the
board,
it
was
made
clear
that
despite
the
vigorous
protest
of
petitioner,
the
board
would
consider
in
making
its
determination
and
recommendation
to
the
secretary
confidential
files
of
investigative
reports
which
it
said
it
had
before
it,
reports
derived
from
other
government
agencies
but
which
it
said
it
would
refuse
to
disclose
to
petitioner.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
summary
afforded
us.
at
that
that
time
however,
when
we
requested
certain
particulars
before
the
hearing,
the
board
advised
--
board's
counsel
advising
us
that
they
could
not
give
us
all
the
particulars
we
requested
because
of
the
security
considerations
involved,
nevertheless,
did
afford
us
certain
particulars.
and
those
particulars
appear
in
the
record
at
pages
48
and
49
of
the
record
in
the
form
of
a
letter
addressed,
“dear
mr.
rand.”
we
were
never
furnished
with
any
report
or
recommendation
from
the
board
of
passport
appeals.
we
know
that
such
a
recommendation
was
made
only
because
we
were
advised
later
that
the
secretary
of
state
had
received
it,
so
the
secretary
advised
us.
we
were
never
furnished
with
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
present
our
case
before
the
secretary
of
state
himself.
in
september
of
1955,
the
secretary
advised
the
petitioner
that
a
passport
was
being
denied
him
under
the
provisions
of
section
51.135
without
specifying
the
particular
provision
or
subsection
of
that
section
under
which
he
was
acting.
the
provisions
of
section
51.135
are
set
forth
at
page
2
of
my
brief,
white-covered
brief.
there
was
at
that
time
no
specification.
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court.
summary
judgment
was
granted
for
the
secretary
in
the
district
court
and
appeal
was
then
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
after
hearing
by
a
three-judge
panel,
the
--
the
summary
judgment
granted
for
the
secretary
was
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
secretary
for
his
reconsideration
with
the
direction
of
the
secretary
if
he
persisted
in
passport
denial
specify
the
particular
subsection
or
subsections
of
51.135
on
which
he
was
going
to
rely
and
further
make
specific
findings
with
respect
to
petitioner.
whereupon
in
october
of
1956
without
further
hearing,
the
secretary
handed
down
the
document
designated
decision
and
findings
which
is
the
document
under
review
here
and
which
appears
at
pages
275
to
278
of
the
record.
i
shall
in
a
moment
address
myself
in
some
greater
detail
to
the
findings
in
that
document.the
--
the
numbers
by
the
way
are
in
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
if
--
that's
right,
it's
the
275,
would
be
in
the
bottom
of
that
page.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well
then,
there's
a
little
supplement
here
and
that
at
page
2
of
that
supplement
as
to
page
275
of
this
record,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
secretary
do
hear
what
they
had
directed
the
secretary
to
do
in
its
former
boudin
case.
the
boudin
case
having
been
heard,
and
that
was
that
the
secretary
reconsider
this
matter.
and
if
he
persisted
in
passport
denial,
that
he
specify
the
particular
subsection
of
51.135
or
subsections
on
which
he
was
relying
and
that
he
makes
specific
findings
and
that
if
he
were
going
to
rely
on
confidential
information
that
he
state
whether
the
information
was
not
being
disclosed
because
of
foreign
relations
considerations
or
because
of
internal
security
considerations.
those
were
the
directions.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
in
complete
conformity
with
what
he
was
directed
to
do.
there's
no
question
about
that
because
directions
were
merely
as
to
form
rather
than
as
to
substance
of
course.
but
the
incomplete
conformity
with
the
court
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
so
far
as
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
and
the
district
court
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
quite
correct.
now,
the
only
--
the
only
amendment
i
might
make,
justice
frankfurter,
in
your
statement
was
that
we
assume
that
the
secretary
had
no
other
information
beyond
what
he'd
had
before
but
we
don't
know
that
as
he
considered
this
record,
but
he
also
considered
his
confidential
files
as
he
concedes.
and
whether
he'
had
gotten
any
additional
files
in
the
interim,
i
don't
know.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
oh
yes,
there's
no
question
that
he
considered
confidential
information
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
oh
certainly,
there
was
--
we
were
--
that
information
was
not
disclosed
to
us.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
oh,
no.
let
me
make
myself
clear.
when
he
made
his
first
ruling
which
ultimately
was
sent
--
he
--
he
was
asked
to
reconsider,
he
admitted
that
he
had
considered
confidential
information.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
against
which
we
protested.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
use
of
confidential
information
was
appropriate.
it
didn't
pass
it
at
that
time.
it
sent
the
matter
back
to
the
secretary.
now,
the
secretary,
without
hearing
then
made
this
decision
on
findings,
and
what
i'm
saying
now
is
that
i
don't
know
whether
the
secretary
when
he
had
this
--
when
he
went
--
gave
us
the
second
go
around
did
not
reach
out
and
get
some
additional
confidential
information.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
don't
know
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
his
findings
are
neutral.
now,
your
honors
will
note
that
the
secretary
concludes
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
he
sets
forth
here
and
on
the
basis
of
the
confidential
information
which
he
refers
to
here
as
follows.
he
concludes
first
that
petitioner
is
a
person
who
comes
within
section
51.135
(c)
of
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
your
honors,
you
--
you
will
find
this
on
page
278
of
the
record,
all
five
of
that
supplement.
justice
brennan,
you
will
note
that
that
--
at
the
top,
i
have
reached
the
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
a
foregoing
findings
together
with
that
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
he
posits
his
passport
denial
here
plainly
on
51.135
(c),
and
51.135
(c)
is
that
provision
which
states
that
passports
may
be
denied
to
persons
regardless
of
their
formal
affiliation
with
the
communist
party
who
the
secretary
has
reason
to
believe
are
going
abroad
to
engage
in
activities
to
advance
the
communist
movement
purposefully
and
willfully
to
advance
that
movement.
and
that
is
the
conclusion
which
the
secretary
reaches
with
respect
to
dr.
dayton.
he
further
says
that
the
issuance
of
a
passport
here
would
be
contrary
to
the
national
interest,
and
those
are
the
two
grounds
on
which
he
relies
here
for
the
passport
denial.
now,
what
is
our
contention
first
of
course
that
the
secretary
had
no
authority
to
deny
a
passport
and
thus
to
bar
travel
to
this
petitioner
on
this
political
ground.
and
in
that
respect,
we
adopt
the
arguments
which
have
been
advanced
by
petitioners
in
the
previous
case.
if
however,
notwithstanding
those
arguments,
this
court
should
find
that
the
secretary
does
have
such
authority.
that
is
if
the
secretary
has
authority
under
statute
and
a
statute
which
is
constitutional
to
deny
passport
to
petitioner
and
to
bar
his
travel
on
a
political
ground
such
as
this
one,
we
still
contend
that
this
passport
denial
here
was
invalid
and
could
not
stand.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
the
political
ground
here,
i
may
--
i
may
have
improperly
termed
--
termed
it.
but
the
ground
here
is
merely
that
this
man
--
so
the
secretary
has
a
reason
to
believe
is
going
abroad
to
engage
in
activities
purposefully
to
advance
the
communist
movement.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
quite
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
and
there
was
no
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
and
there
is
no
charge
of
membership
and
no
finding
of
membership,
nor
is
there
any
finding
under
subsection
(b)
that
petitioner
is
a
person
who
is
supporting
the
communist
movement.
there
is
merely
a
finding
that
petitioner
--
there
are
conclusion
that
petitioner
is
a
person
bent
on
advancing
the
movement
by
engaging
in
such
activities
abroad.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i'm
urging
both
and
with
respect
to
the
first,
i'm
--
the
first
argument,
i
am
prepared
particularly
in
view
of
the
limitations
of
time
to
rest
on
the
arguments
of
petitioners
in
the
previous
case,
although
i
understand
that
the
different
shades
here
with
respect
to
--
to
my
case
and
petitioner's
case.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
as
i
--
if
i
may
first,
the
due
process
argument.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes,
using
these
particular
standards,
i
would
--
i
would
urge
that
as
well.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that
is
if
--
if
the
standard
which
the
congress
legislated
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes,
i
would
your
honor
although
i
don't
have
to
reach
that
here.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
but
i
would
say
that's
unconstitutional
because
well,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
i
would
urge
first
the
first
amendment
right
of
preassembly
in
association.
i
would
urge
first
to
the
lack
of
a
requirement
for
of
scienter
in
--
in
such
a
situation.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
would
urge
further
that
i
don't
--
that
the
--
the
standards
set
up
was
not
precise
enough.
i
don't
know
what
promoting
the
communist
movement
means
and
i
--
as
i
suggested
in
my
reply
brief,
perhaps
one
going
to
paris
and
stopping
at
le
kiosque
combined
with
a
copy
of
(inaudible)
would
be
advancing
the
movement.
and
if
one
reads
the
government's
brief,
i
think
under
their
concept
of
what
the
advancement
of
the
movement
means
that
would
be
an
act
in
advancement
of
movement.
for
those
various
reasons,
i
would
urge
the
unconstitutionality
of
such
a
provision
but
i
needn't
reach
it.
and
my
first
argument
here
is
that
would
not
be
with
respect
to
the
use
of
secret
evidence
which
i'd
like
to
free
from
that
argument
on
for
a
moment,
but
will
be
with
respect
to
the
question
as
to
whether
even
assuming
the
truth
of
what
the
secretary
has
told
us
in
his
findings
and
in
the
confidential
information
that
he
tells
us,
relate
to
those
findings
even
assuming
the
truth
of
that
and
the
accuracy
of
all
that.
the
question
i
raise
is
whether
there
is
any
rational
nexus
which
due
process
requires
between
the
findings
the
secretary
has
made
and
the
conclusions
he
has
reached.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
there
is
no
rational
connection
such
as
the
due
process
provisions
of
the
--
requirements
of
the
constitution
imposed.
now,
at
this
point
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
specific
findings
which
have
been
made.
at
page
276,
the
court
will
find
--
276
of
the
record,
page
3
of
that
little
supplement.
the
court
will
find
that
the
first
finding
deals
with
the
activity
of
dr.
dayton
in
1943
and
1944
while
at
the
university
of
california
as
chairman
of
a
--
an
organization
known
as
a
science
for
victory
committee
and
his
association
as
such
chairman
with
three-named
persons
who
had
been
instrumental
in
organizing
that
science
for
victory
committee.
that
is
the
finding
on
the
open
record,
and
then
the
secretary
tells
us
that
confidential
information
indicates
that
the
committee
was
conceived
and
organized
by
the
communist
party
as
a
front
for
propaganda
and
espionage
activities
and
the
three-named
persons
were
members
of
the
party,
the
three-named
persons
here
were
members
of
the
party
at
the
time
of
their
association
with
petitioner.
then
in
paragraph
ii,
we
read
the
finding
based
on
the
open
record
with
respect
to
an
association
for
a
four-year
period
in
ithaca,
1946
to
1950
between
petitioner
and
one
sarant.
confidential
information
as
for
this
matter,
says
the
secretary,
establishes
that
sarant
was
an
active
member
of
the
communist
party
that
he
admitted
said
membership
in
1943
and
1944,
this
was
before
his
meeting
as
you
--
as
the
court
will
note
with
petitioner
and
that
he
was
involved
in
rosenberg
espionage
operators.
paragraph
iii
deals
with
petitioner's
presence
during
1949
and
1950
on
more
than
one
occasion,
in
a
new
york
city
apartment
building
in
which
sarant
was
lessee
of
an
apartment.
and
the
confidential
information
as
for
that,
says
the
secretary,
indicates
that
sarant's
new
york
city
apartment
was
used
by
rosenberg
and
other
members
of
his
firing
for
microfilming
classified
u.s.
government
documents.
paragraph
iv
deals
with
the
association
in
continuing
relationship
of
which
by
the
way
petitioner
testified
he
was
proud
since
1938
with
one
bernard
peters,
dr.
bernard
peters
who
now
is
at
tata
institute,
although
at
--
in
the
next
academic
year
as
i've
suggested
that
he
has
been
invited
to
go
to
the
copenhagen
institute,
the
bohr
institute
for
a
year,
his
association
with
dr.
bernard
peters
who
is
responsible
for
petitioner's
offer
of
employment
to
tata
institute.
and
then
confidential
information
indicates,
says
the
secretary
that
dr.
peters
has
held
membership
in
the
communist
party
outside
the
united
states,
has
engaged
in
numerous
communist
activities
both
to
this
country
and
abroad
and
is
suspected
of
being
a
communist
espionage
agent.
this
is
a
summon
substance
of
the
secretary's
findings
and
the
supposedly
related
confidential
information
which
he's
never
disclosed
to
us
relating
to
those
findings
on
which
the
secretary
bases
his
conclusions
here.
now,
note
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes.
that
will
be
found,
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
on
page
278
of
the
record.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
it's
in
the
--
the
little
supplement
at
the
end.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
it
was
bound
in
which
is
page
5
of
that
supplement.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
v
and
vi,
paragraphs
v
and
vi
state
the
--
the
reasons.
now
--
since
we're
--
we've
reached
that
point,
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
dichotomy
which
is
drawn
by
the
secretary
here.
the
confidential
information
of
which
he
has
--
to
which
he
has
referred
with
respect
to
paragraphs
i
to
iv,
says
the
secretary,
that
is
a
confidential
information
i've
just
talked
about,
can't
be
disclosed
because,
says
the
secretary,
to
disclose
it
publicly
would
in
his
judgment
be
detrimental
to
the
national
interest,
i'm
reading
from
vi,
by
compromising
investigative
sources
and
methods
and
seriously
interfering
with
the
ability
of
this
department
and
the
executive
branch
to
obtain
reliable
information
affecting
our
internal
security,
moreover,
it
would
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
our
ability
to
obtain
and
utilize
information
from
sources
abroad
and
interfere
with
our
established
relationships
in
the
security
and
intelligence
area.
and
then
note,
the
second
part
of
this
economy.
and
might
--
the
dichotomy
--
and
might
with
the
respect
to
the
information
referred
to
in
paragraph
v
prejudice
the
interest
of
u.s.
foreign
relations.
now,
the
court
will
note
that
this
information
referred
to
in
paragraph
v
is
not
related
to
the
four
findings,
and
we
have
not
a
glimmer
here
in
the
record
of
what
this
information
referred
to
in
paragraph
v
may
concern.
there
is
not
the
slightest
hint
of
what
this
additional
body
of
paragraph
into
my
--
five
information
relates
to.
now,
based
on
all
this
confidential
information
including
the
paragraph
v
information
and
that
the
findings
from
the
open
record,
the
secretary
concluded
as
he
did.
note
however
what
the
secretary
has
failed
to
find
here,
and
to
me,
this
is
as
significant
as
what
he
did
find
if
not
more
significant.
he
has
not
found
any
reason
to
believe
anywhere
in
this
entire
record
that
petitioner
ever
knew
that
the
science
for
victory
committee
was
organized
by
the
communist
party
or
for
the
improper
purposes
alleged
or
that
the
three-named
persons
associated
with
him
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
or
that
petitioner
himself
and
this
is
most
significant.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
record
that
the
secretary
has
a
reason
to
believe
that
petitioner
himself
ever
engaged
in
communist
propaganda
or
espionage
activities.
there
is
no
such
finding.
there
is
no
such
--
such
suggestion
in
this
entire
decision.
the
secretary
further
hasn't
found
any
reason
to
believe
that
sarant's
allegedly
wrongful
activities
were
contemporaneous
with
petitioner's
association
with
him
or
that
petitioner
wasn't
the
least
informed
of
such
activities.
the
secretary
hasn't
found
a
reason
to
believe
that
petitioner's
presence
in
the
new
york
city
apartment
building
which
by
the
way
he
has
steadfastly
denied
throughout
many,
many
years
but
let's
assume
the
presence.
the
secretary
hasn't
found
that
his
presence
there
was
for
any
improper
purpose
or
in
the
company
of
sarant,
or
in
the
company
of
rosenberg
or
even
coincidentally
calendar
year
with
the
alleged
presence
of
rosenberg
and
the
other
members
of
aspiring
of
such
presence
actually
occurred
in
this
apartment.
the
secretary
hasn't
found
reason
to
believe
that
petitioner
has
ever
known
of
dr.
peter's
alleged
communist
activities.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
will
read
this
record.
the
court
will
find
testimony
of
petitioner
undisputed
in
the
open
record
that
peters,
he
assure
was
never
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
they
will
find
testimony
of
petitioner
that
so
far
as
he
knew,
the
science
for
victory
committee
was
not
communist-dominated
because
he
wasn't
a
communist
and
the
policies
of
the
committee
while
he
was
chairman
with
his
policies.
they
will
find
testimony
in
this
record
that
petitioner
never
knew
sarant
to
have
engaged
in
communist
activities,
so
that
was
a
fact.
in
these
circumstances,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
--
the
rational
connection
which
is
necessary
which
due
process
requires
between
the
findings
and
--
and
confidential
information
on
the
one
hand
even
if
we
assume
they
are
true.
and
what
the
secretary
says
on
the
other
is
just
lacking
here.
how
can
the
secretary
reasonably
find
that
because
petitioner
is
innocently
associated
with
one
organization
and
in
certain
named-persons
over
a
period
of
years
and
has
been
innocently
present
in
an
apartment
building
in
the
past
that
in
1956,
he
is
going
abroad
to
engage
in
activities
to
advance
--
purposefully
to
advance
the
communist
movement.
as
this
court
has
put
it
another
case,
the
connection
between
the
fact
proved
and
that
presumed
is
not
sufficient,
reasoning
doesn't
lead
from
one
to
the
other.
now,
what
--
how
does
the
government
answer
this
argument?
the
government
has
two
answers.
the
government
first
says
that
it's
reasonable
to
assume
or
rather,
they
put
it
in
the
negative.
it's
not
reasonable
--
not
unreasonable
to
infer
that
petitioner's
past
activities
and
associations
weren't
the
innocent
ones
that
he's
contended,
but
really
were
linked
together
by
some
common
thread
of
close
communist
involvement.
now,
let
me
point
out
as
i've
said
that
the
record
nowhere
supports
such
an
inference.
but
even
if
the
record
did,
the
fact
is
that
the
secretary
hasn't
made
such
an
inference.
and
we
--
as
i
understand
it,
are
here
today
reviewing
what
the
secretary
decided
and
what
he
said
and
what
he
found
and
not
a
belated
gloss
which
the
secretary's
lawyers
put
on
his
findings,
not
the
act
of
thinking
as
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court
referred
to
such
a
process
the
other
day,
not
the
act
of
thinking
of
government
lawyers
here
as
to
what
its
determination
should
have
been.
the
second
answer
that
the
government
makes
is
stopping
in
its
audacity.
the
second
answer
the
government
offers
is,
there
maybe
a
hiatus
between
the
findings
and
the
confidential
information
on
the
one
hand
and
then
conclusions
the
secretary
reaches
on
the
other,
but
we've
got
to
assume
that
that
hiatus
is
filled
by
this
paragraph
v
undisclosed
information
about
which
we
haven't
the
least
hint.
and
why
must
we
assume
that,
says
the
government?
we
must
assume
that
because
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
tells
us
he
can't
tell
us
what
that
information
is
because
it
would
affect
foreign
relations,
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
assume
that
this
information
related
more
directly
to
the
purposes
of
petitioner's
travel
than
it
did
to
his
past
activities.
now
again,
i
say
first,
that
if
the
secretary
believes
that
or
the
secretary
should
know,
if
this
is
what
that
information
related
to,
then
we
certainly
were
entitled
to
have
that
in
--
that
statement
made
by
the
secretary
and
he's
not
done
that.
he
hasn't
told
us
what
this
paragraph
v
information
concerns.
and
merely
to
have
told
us
what
it
concerns,
would
not
have
breached
any
confidence
but
he
has
not
made
that
statement
and
it
is
his
lawyers
who
make
it
for
the
first
time
on
this
court.
secondly,
if
these
are
the
lacunae
in
administrative
decisions,
that
is
the
lacunae
between
findings
and
conclusions,
can
be
filled
that
a
bottomless
well
of
nebulous
information
such
as
we
have
here
in
paragraph
v.
if
in
other
words,
unreason
are
illogic
in
administrative
decisions
can
always
be
as
i
put
it
out,
chemically
converted
to
reason
by
resort
to
a
body
of
secret
information
that
the
government
needs
never
supplied
to
the
court
or
to
the
agreed
parties,
then
i
don't
think
much
is
left
of
due
process.
one
can
always
meet
substantive
due
process
efficiencies
by
resorting
to
this
vast
body
of
--
of
state
secrets
which
are
state
secrets
solely
of
course
on
the
ipse
dixit
of
the
government
officer
involved.
it
becomes
plain,
it
seems
to
me,
that
these
findings
and
this
so-called
relevant
confidential
information
can
assume
significance
or
relevance
to
petitioner
if
they
have
any
relevance
to
petitioner
at
all,
only
insofar
as
they
reflect
a
judgment
of
guilt
by
association.
and
as
i
read
this
case,
and
as
i
read
it
for
many
years,
perhaps
i'm
too
close
to
it,
but
as
i've
read
for
many
years,
this
case
is
a
rank
case
where
we
--
a
rank
example
of
an
official
judgment
of
vicarious
guilt.
no
other
way
can
one
explain
why
this
man
is
being
denied
in
the
constitutional
right,
and
preceded
the
constitutional
right
on
the
basis
of
findings
with
respect
to
innocent
association
so
far
as
the
secretary
makes
such
findings,
absolutely
innocent
associations.
now,
the
government
says
in
answer
to
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
none,
whatever.
none
whatever.
in
fact,
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
i
counsel
might
find
unwisely
because
we
gave
more
information
than
the
secretary
asked
for.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i'd
say
for
this
reason,
the
secretary
makes
four
findings
from
the
open
record
here.
three
of
those
findings
are
derived
solely
from
the
information
which
my
man
gave,
that
is
my
client.
notwithstanding
that
fact,
because
there's
a
conflict
in
evidence
with
respect
in
testimony,
with
respect
to
one
aspect
of
these
charges
was
petitioner
present
in
this
apartment
building
at
any
time
because
there's
a
conflict
between
petitioner's
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
the
three
custodial
employees
at
that
building
which
conflict
maybe
due
to
mistaken
identification
which
is
quite
common
in
cases
of
this
character.
because
of
that
one
conflict,
the
secretary
in
effect,
and
i
say
this
advisedly,
brands
dr.
dayton,
a
man
of
doubtful
credibility.
and
he
says
he
has
serious
doubts
as
to
the
credibility
--
general
credibility
of
this
witness.
now,
mind
you,
the
only
source
of
the
testimony
or
the
evidence
for
the
three
findings
made
from
the
open
record
under
that
--
other
than
that
one
finding
is
the
testimony
of
this
man
who
says
the
secretary,
he
has
serious
doubts
about
--
with
respect
to
its
general
credibility.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
perhaps
i
--
i
--
am
mistaken
with
my
feeling
but
often
i
felt
that
i
counseled
him
wrongly
and
--
and
i
--
i
--
i'm
glad
--
i'm
glad
to
have
the
views
of
this
court
that
i
did
not.[laughter]
mr.
harry
i.
rand
three
live
witnesses,
the
--
a
senior
--
a
rather
elderly
gentleman
who
was
a
--
who
had
been
a
janitor
of
this
building
or
superintendent
of
this
building
in
new
york
at
one
time.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes,
that's
right.
and
--
it's
--
it's
our
view
that
the
--
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
and
we
were
permitted
to
cross-examine
them.
i
was
permitted
to
cross-examine
them.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
oh,
yes.
my
man
has
testified
before
grand
juries.
he
has
stated
to
the
--
the
fbi
agents
and
he
has
stated
throughout
this
proceeding
under
oath
that
he
has
never
been
present
in
this
apartment
building
except
in
1951
when
--
at
the
request
of
fbi
agents
who
were
then
investigating
the
matter,
he
accompanied
them
to
that
address.
he
has
testified
for
--
since
1950
under
oath
that
he's
never
been
present.
he
has
never
been
indicted
for
perjury.
he's
never
been
charged
with
perjury.
he's
never
been
charged
with
doubtful
credibility
before
the
secretary's
decision
here.
these
three
witnesses
who
identified
dr.
dayton
as
the
--
as
a
man
they
saw
were
not
called
before
the
grand
juries
who
were
--
who
heard
my
--
who
heard
dr.
dayton,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
apparently
they
were
called
outside
in
the
anteroom
of
the
grand
jury
to
identify
people
as
they
walked
in
or
to
look
at
people
as
they
walked
in.
the
record
shows
they
were
not
called
before
the
grand
juries.
i
think
their
--
their
testimony
is
incredible,
but
whether
incredible
or
not,
this
--
the
court
knows,
professor
whitmore
has
said
that
there
are
more
tragic
miscarriages
of
justice
in
this
field
of
identification
testimony
than
anywhere
else.
and
this
may
well
be,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
malicious
about
these
people.
i
think
they
have
just
--
they
think
they
saw
dr.
dayton
there
and
dr.
dayton
has
persisted
in
his
statement
that
he's
never
been
there.
now,
let
me
pass
for
the
other
aspect
of
due
process
which
i
think
is
extremely
important
here
and
that
is
the
use
of
secret
information.
there's
no
question
here
that
secret
information
was
used.
it
was
used
excess
--
extensively
in
this
proceeding
and
there's
no
question
that
it
painted
every
step
of
the
administrative
proceeding.
the
government
argues
and
the
court
below
erroneously
assumed
that
the
substance
of
this
undisclosed
information
had
been
actually
disclosed
to
petitioner.
and
that's
because
of
these
--
these
referrals
with
respect
to
each
one
of
these
four
findings
in
the
decision.
the
fact
is
however
that
that
substance
was
not
disclosed
to
petitioner.
what
do
we
have?
we
have
here
at
most
a
statement
by
the
secretary
as
to
what
he
infers,
what
he
infers
from
the
confidential
information
that
he's
apparently
read.
he
gives
his
characterizations.
he
gives
us
conclusions
but
we've
never
seen
the
tales,
sources,
substance
of
this
information.
moreover,
with
respect
to
the
paragraph
v
information
if
i
may
repeat
what
i've
said
before,
we
don't
even
have
a
hint
as
to
what
that
concerns
and
the
government
in
its
brief
now
tells
us
that
that
is
extremely
important
that
that
is
indeed
the
important
information
which
fills
the
gap
between
--
in
the
reasoning
between
findings
and
conclusions.
there
isn't
time
here
in
the
few
moments
i
have
left
to
consider
that
in
detail
the
conflicting
interest
between
the
citizen
and
the
government
on
this
issue
of
non-disclosure.
now,
we
are
aware
that
this
is
a
delicate
problem
where
--
where
it's
a
tough
problem
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
other
connections
which
have
tried
to
solve
the
problem
attest
i
think
to
its
difficulty.
there
seems
to
us
however
a
little
question
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
where
we're
dealing
with
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
that
there
can
be
no
fair
hearing
as
guaranteed
by
our
constitution.
when
a
citizen
whose
right
has
been
abridged,
can't
even
see
the
information
which
the
government
office
who
will
abridge
us
to
that
right
tells
him
he's
relied
on
and
particularly
where
that
information
is
as
extensive
as
apparently
it
is
in
this
proceeding.
there
may
be
some
justification
for
keeping
secret
this
foreign
relation's
information,
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
know.
i
certainly
would
urge
there's
none.
but
the
government
has
admitted
in
its
brief
what
is
the
fact
here
that
the
bulk
of
the
information
on
which
the
secretary
relied
on
this
case
was
not
of
that
time.
the
bulk
of
the
information
as
the
government
briefs
--
government's
brief
says
at
page
82,
we
must
assume
was
derived
from
fbi
reports.
it
was
the
very
kind
of
information
which
is
predominated
in
all
government
employee
loyalty
security
programs.
as
to
such
information,
the
government
has
no
real
foreign
affairs
concern.
its
interest
lie
in
--
in
nondisclosure,
is
merely
in
trying
to
avoid
the
compromise
as
it
were,
compromise
there
would
be
of
its
sources
and
--
and
methods
of
gathering
together
this
information.
and
we
suggest
that
there
can
be
no
fairer
characterization
of
what
kind
of
information
this
is
than
the
characterization
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
applied
to
it
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
jay
against
boyd
where
justice
frankfurter
said,
“we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
in
conspicuous
instances
not
negligible
in
number,
such
confidential
information
has
turned
out
to
be
either
baseless
or
false.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
only
these
conspicuous
instances
illustrate
the
hazards
inherent
in
taking
action
affecting
the
lives
of
fellowmen
on
the
basis
of
such
information,
the
probabilities
under
the
contrary.”
and
recent
history,
particularly
other
these
cases
in
this
court
i
think,
eloquently
support
this
view.
the
secretary
himself
has
no
confidence
in
this
information
as
his
own
decision
may
explain.
if
the
court
please,
turn
to
pages
276
and
277
of
the
record
and
note
what
the
secretary
of
state,
an
able
lawyer
and
draftsman
does
with
respect
to
his
references
to
confidential
information.
as
to
finding
i
--
i
(b),
the
court
will
note
that
the
secretary
says
that
that
confidential
information
indicates
this,
the
--
the
matters
he
refers
to.
as
to
finding
ii,
he
says
confidential
information
establishes
certain
things.
as
to
finding
iii,
confidential
information
indicates.
as
to
finding
iv,
confidential
information
indicates.
it
seems
plain
to
us
that
the
secretary
himself
has
no
confidence
in
these
informers,
the
identity
of
whom
he
himself
has
admitted.
in
other
cases,
he
sometimes
doesn't
know
and
the
reliability
of
whom
therefore
he
cannot
vouch
for.
moreover,
let
me
point
to
finding
4.
note
that
the
secretary
says
that
confidential
information
indicates
that
dr.
peters,
not
is
--
is
an
espionage
agent
but
is
a
suspected
espionage
agent.
that
indeed
is
surmised
hit
on
suspicion.
now,
this
vice
that
follows
from
the
use
of
secret
information
is
particularly
vicious
in
a
case
of
this
kind
where
we
have
no
congressional
authorization
for
the
procedures
which
have
been
followed
here.
perhaps
the
congress
does
permit
the
establishment
of
political
standards.
we
urge
it
does
not.
but
one
thing
is
clear
and
the
government
cannot
--
certainly
will
not
urge
the
--
the
contrary.
the
congress
nowhere
has
stated
in
any
statute
unequivocally
and
unambiguously
that
the
traditional
modes
of
justice
and
due
process
can
be
departed
from
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
and
this
court's
prior
decisions
as
i
read
them
where
it
may
have
sanctioned
to
some
extent
the
use
of
confidential
information,
certainly
have
not
dealt
with
cases
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights
abridged
through
the
use
of
such
information.
surely,
we
have
decisions
where
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
president
in
the
--
in
--
in
the
true
foreign
relations
here
involving
negotiations
with
government
et
cetera,
may
rely
on
secret
information.
we
did
not
disclose
that.
in
the
alien
cases,
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
privilege
as
it
were
of
race
rather
than
right.
and
similarly,
in
jay
against
boyd,
we
were
dealing
with
matter
of
grace.
in
the
nugent
case
dealing
with
the
consciences
objectors,
the
court
will
remember
that
that
case
was
decided
on
the
very
basic
consideration
as
this
court
later
stated
in
its
simmons
decision,
that
the
confidential
information
there
was
used
only
incidental
to
an
advisory
opinion
of
the
--
of
the
department
of
justice
and
not
in
connection
with
the
final
determination
affecting
rights.
so
i
do
not
see
that
there
can
be
any
question
that
any
prior
decisions
of
this
court
compel
a
result
here
sanctioning
the
use
of
confidential
information.
now,
one
furthermore
matter
and
then
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
which
i
may
have
for
rebuttal.
let
me
point
to
the
vagueness
of
grounds
which
--
of
the
grounds
used
by
the
secretary
here,
relied
on
by
the
secretary
which
i've
already
averted.
we
have
sought
for
four
years
now
in
state
department
and
the
courts
to
find
out
just
what
it
is
the
secretary
fears
that
petitioner
will
do.
we've
asked
for
some
specification.
what
is
it
you
fear
this
petitioner
will
do?
perhaps
if
we
found
out
what
it
was,
the
secretary
was
worried
about,
the
petitioner
might
give
him
some
assurance
that
he
wouldn't
engage
in
the
activities
that
the
secretary
was
worried
about.
the
secretary
has
persistently
and
consistently
refused
to
specify
what
he
has
in
mind.
and
so
on
these
grounds,
these
very
vague
grounds
here,
the
fact
is
that
petitioner
for
a
lifetime
assuming
the
emergency
continues
for
a
lifetime,
can
never
hope
to
expurgate
himself
from
this
(inaudible)
like
web
that
has
been
woven
about
him
by
these
very
ambiguous
standards.
he
cannot
of
course
turn
the
clock
back
and
disassociate
himself
from
the
people
he's
associated
with
in
the
past.
he
cannot
know
what
to
do
with
respect
to
his
overseas
activities
because
he
doesn't
know
what
the
secretary
fears
he
may
do.
and
he
said,
“all
i
want
to
do
is
do
search
at
tata
institute.”
for
these
various
reasons
and
for
the
others
stated
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
there
can
be
no
question
here
that
even
assume
authority
in
the
secretary
to
control
travel
on
the
basis
of
these
standards,
there
has
been
a
very
drastic
and
unjust
violation
of
due
process
in
this
case.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
nothing
but
the
findings
which
we
referred
to
in
subparagraphs
a
of
each
one
of
the
--
of
paragraphs
i
through
iv.
those
are
the
only
findings
which
would
be
left,
in
other
words,
his
associations.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
not
--
not
as
to
the
latter,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
if
one
agreed
with
judge
fay
in
his
conclusion,
the
secretary
would
take
this
case
back
and
then
on
consideration
of
the
record
including
the
confidential
information
so
far
as
i
know
because
judge
fay,
he
did
not
suggest
the
use
of
that
was
improper,
would
then
be
required
to
determine
whether
the
denial
of
a
passport
to
dr.
dayton
would
be
likely
to
cause
harm
to
national
defense
or
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs.
in
other
words,
what
judge
fay
was
saying
as
i
understood
it
was
that
the
grounds
in
subsection
c
of
51.135
were
too
vague
and
too
--
too
nebulous
and
that
the
--
the
use
of
the
--
the
framework
national
interest
was
too
nebulous.
and
judge
fay,
he
wanted
to
be
assured
that
before
the
secretary
denied
a
passport,
he
would
make
a
finding
that
the
grant
of
it
would
be
likely
to
cause
harm
to
national
defense
or
to
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
affairs.
that's
as
i
read
his
opinion.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
he
doesn't
express
to
someone
that.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
by
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
that
the
full
statement
of
the
secretary
appears
in
five
and
six
of
the
specific.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
other
--
other
than
what
embarrassment
would
come
from
disclosure.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
other
than
of
course
what
he
says
here
that
it
would
compromise
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
--
investigative
sources
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
--
that
might
affect
foreign
relations.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
i
may
--
i
may
have
said
it,
i
don't
recall.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
and
moreover,
i
do
not
understand
that
judge
fay,
he
--
when
he
spoke
of
the
two
findings
had
in
mind
the
findings
as
i
referred
to
them.
when
he
used
the
term
findings,
i
think
judge
fay,
he
meant
the
two
conclusions.
that
is
the
one
based
on
51.135
(c)
and
the
national
interest
conclusion.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
--
i
think
that's
what
he
has
in
mind.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
--
i
just
have
a
few
things
to
say
if
i
may.
first,
with
respect
to
the
reference
that
has
been
made
to
the
renunciation
of
american
citizenship
by
dr.
peters.
i
have
always
--
always
since
the
decision
came
down
but
unable
to
understand
the
relevance
of
that
reference
which
the
secretary
makes.
i'd
always
assume
as
this
court
only
recently
affirmed
the
other
day
that
the
right
of
expatriation,
the
right
of
voluntary
renunciation
of
citizenship
had
always
been
a
valued
right
of
an
american
and
that
one
should
not
therefore
suggest
any
inference
as
the
secretary
apparently
does
here
that
when
a
person
renounces
his
citizenship,
he
is
to
be
suspected.
particularly
so
in
the
case
of
dr.
peters
who
was
a
german
citizen
and
who
came
here
to
escape
nazi
persecution,
became
a
naturalized
american
citizen.
and
naturally
after
the
war
resumed
as
i
understand
it,
west
german
citizenship,
so
that
he
could
again
--
as
it
were
assumed,
the
citizenship
of
his
native
land.
reference
was
made
to
the
question
of
sarant's
running
off
with
petitioner's
wife,
unfortunately
that
is
true.
the
petitioner
has
suffered
there
as
well
as
from
the
secretary
of
state.
i
don't
know
however
--
i
don't
know
however,
if
any
other
case
where
a
person
has
been
branded
for
associating,
perhaps
he
should
be,
for
associating
with
the
person
who
runs
off
with
his
wife.
i
again
do
not
quite
understand
the
reference
which
the
secretary
makes
there
as
perhaps
suggesting
an
inference
that
petitioner
had
something
as
engaged
in
wrongful
activities
with
sarant.
i
should
think
petitioner's
wife
did
rather
than
petitioner.
third,
as
to
the
january
1950,
as
to
the
presence
of
the
apartment
building,
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
here
that
we
have
here
merely
a
testimony
of
one
as
against
another,
a
no
as
against
a
yes.
well,
there
is
something
more
than
that
in
this
record
as
the
court
will
note
if
the
court
examines
the
record.
when
petitioner
was
first
charged
with
presence
of
the
apartment
building,
the
fbi
agents
who
suggested
as
to
whom
also
suggested
the
month
of
january
1950
as
being
the
date
when
he
was
present
--
present
there.
and,
if
the
court
will
note
that
at
page
167
to
page
169
or
170
of
the
record,
petitioner
documents
practically
everyday
in
the
month
of
january
1950
when
fortunately
he
could
document
everyday
because
he
was
busy
practically
everyday
and
sometimes
during
the
nights
working
at
the
cyclotron
at
cornell
university
with
a
view
toward
completing
his
phd
thesis.
so
he
was
able
to
put
himself
at
ithaca
practically
everyday
of
that
month.
well,
as
the
proceeding
went
on,
the
--
the
dates
began
to
shift,
and
if
your
honors
will
examine
the
--
the
lengthy
footnote
i
have
set
forth
on
pages
56
and
58
of
my
brief,
the
petitioner's
brief
analyzing
the
testimony
of
these
three
custodial
employees,
your
honors
will
note
how
in
their
testimony
as
they
testify
on
the
one
day,
their
dates
keep
shifting
around
like
quicksand.
and
we've
often
wondered,
petitioner
certainly
has,
just
when
--
when
this
--
this
merry-go-round
stops.
he
has
documented
january
1950,
a
suggestion
was
made
as
to
july
or
august
of
1949
and
he
sought
to
document
that,
sought
to
testify
as
to
that
and
the
dates
change.
indeed,
your
honors
will
note
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
don't
know.
they
--
they
fixed
on
different
dates.
each
one
of
these
witnesses
had
some
different
date
as
your
--
as
the
court
will
note
from
the
analysis
of
their
--
their
testimony.
and
the
secretary
doesn't
set
a
date.
the
secretary
says
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
1949
and
1950,
there
is
no
specification
of
date.
indeed
the
secretary
does
not
find
the
petitioner
was
present
as
charged
in
the
sarant
apartment.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
yes,
january
1950
and
july
or
august
of
1949.
we
know
those
two
--
those
two
dates
and
we
sought
to
meet
them
at
the
hearing
but
they've
shifted,
continually
shifted.
some
reference
has
been
made,
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
no
more
than
myself
knows
just
what
the
secretary
has
considered.
and
perhaps
therefore,
we're
not
qualified
to
say
whether
there
is
any
justification
in
keeping
secret
confidential
information.
but
there
is
one
man
who
i
think
is
qualified
and
that
is
our
former
secretary
of
state,
dean
acheson,
who
--
who
promulgated
these
regulations
we
have
attacked
here
and
who
undoubtedly
had
some
familiarity
with
the
proceedings
under
them.
and
as
i
have
quoted
at
page
33
of
our
brief,
mr.
dean
acheson,
now
a
private
citizen,
writing
in
his
volume
of
democrat
looks
at
his
party,
characterizes
these
regulations,
these
very
procedure
is
a
grave
mistake
and
a
failure
to
force
the
consequences
which
were
inevitable.
and
he
characterizes
the
practice
of
secret
evidence
and
secret
informants
which
the
regulation
has
sanctioned
as
alien
to
our
conception
of
justice
and
the
rights
of
the
citizen.
now,
i
think
the
former
secretary
of
state
should
know
a
little
about
how
these
procedures
worked
because
as
this
court
knows,
knows
as
well
as
myself,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
monolithic
structure
called
the
secretary
of
state.
i
too
have
worked
in
the
government,
and
when
we
speak
of
the
secretary
of
state,
we
realize
that
there
are
numerous
subordinates
who
enter
into
these
decisions
and
he's
not
merely
the
one
responsible
individual
who
reads
this
record
carefully
from
beginning
to
end.
thank
you
very
much.
