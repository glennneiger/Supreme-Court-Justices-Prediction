weldon
bruce
dayton,
petitioner,
versus
john
foster
dulles.
mr.
rand,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
about
three
or
four
minutes,
three
minutes
of
the
court
to
--
to
conclude
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
before
the
hearing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
it
occur?
chief
justice
earl
warren
five
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
general
i'm
--
i'm
sure
you've
answered
already
but
i
just
want
to
be
positive
in
my
mind.
you
--
it
is
your
position
or
is
it
your
position
that
the
secretary
of
state
can
deny
a
passport
to
an
american
citizen
solely
on
the
grounds
of
confidential
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
he
doesn't
have
to
disclose
it,
why
couldn't
it
be
domestic
affairs
or
--
or
economic
affairs
or
--
or
for
any
other
reason.
who
is
going
to
review
whether
it
is
foreign
affairs
beyond
what
he
says?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
say
then
that
the
--
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
--
to
have
him
produce
the
--
the
confidential
information
that
he
has?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
you
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
that
--
that's
what
i
mean.
he
can
--
your
position
is
that
he
can
do
--
he
can
do
it.
he
can
deny
a
passport
to
an
american
citizen
as
he
says
based
on
--
on
confidential
information
which
convinces
him
that
it
would
be
against
the
best
interest
of
our
country
to
permit
this
travel
and
do
that
without
any
review
whatsoever.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
all
he
has
to
do
is
just
say
it
is
on
that
ground.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
that
--
even
though
that
is
to
deprive
an
american
citizen
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
true
but
do
--
have
we
--
in
what
other
field
if
we
ever
permitted
them
to
do
it
on
the
un-reviewable
word
of
any
officer,
i'm
talking
about
the
peacetime,
not
--
not
war.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
or
have
we
ever
done
that
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
one
thing
for
the
president
to
refuse
to
disclose
information
that
he
considers
confidential
when
somebody
else
wants
it
to
review
his
action?
and
is
--
isn't
it
another
thing
when
--
when
a
person
whom
he
deprives
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right
wants
to
know
what
the
information
is
in
order
that
he
may
prepare
his
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
thought
congress
could
not
pass
such
a
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
may
i
add
to
what
justice
harlan
asked
you
just
the
--
the
phrase
or
the
clause
when
--
whenever
in
his
judgment
it
will
adversely
affect
our
foreign
relations.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
a
lot
to
their
position
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can't
see
the
--
i
can't
see
the
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
right.
you're
right
to
get
the
information
has
to
give
way
but
does
your
right
to
--
to
be
a
free
american
and
travel
have
to
give
way
if
he
won't
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wasn't
--
is
there
a
difference
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
can
hardly
treat
it
in
the
light
of
just
one
person,
because
if
he
could
do
it
to
one,
he
could
do
it
to
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rand,
your
time
has
expired
but
we
took
so
much
time
with
questions.
you
may
have
five
minutes
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
close.
