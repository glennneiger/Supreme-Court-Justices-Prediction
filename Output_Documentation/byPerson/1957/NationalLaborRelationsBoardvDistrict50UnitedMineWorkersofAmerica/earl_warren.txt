mr.

chief

earl

was
there
any
claim
or
any
finding
that
the
district
50
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
employer
only?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
order
--
is
the
order
in
this
case
less
drastic
than
--than
the
disestablishment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
it
is
less
drastic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
the
local
purge
itself
if
this
national
organization
doesn't
make
the
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
it
ever
--
how
could
it
ever
be
certified
by
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
why
i
asked
you
if
it
is
less
drastic
in
the
--
than
the
disestablishment
of
the
--
of
the
union
that
you
spoke
of.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
could
this
local
purge
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
and
that
--
that
isn't
important
in
this
case,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
even
if
it
did.
even
if
it
did
purge
itself
of
that
influence,
it
never
could
represent
those
employees
even
though
100%
of
them
wanted
the
--
wanted
the
union
to
represent
them,
unless
the
national
union
complied.
chief
justice
earl
warren
therefore
--
therefore
it
cannot
represent
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
this
order.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
this
is
a
death
sentence
to
this
district
50,
insofar
as
this
establishment
is
concerned.

justice
earl
warren
mr.
harris.
chief
justice
earl

we'll
recess
