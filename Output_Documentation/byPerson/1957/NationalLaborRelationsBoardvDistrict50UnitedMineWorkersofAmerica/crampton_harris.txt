mr.
crampton
harris
may
the
court
please.
the
time
element
and
is
into
this
case
and
that
also
answers
the
question
asked
by
the
chief
justice.
the
unfair
labor
practice
committed
in
the
first
instance
against
the
teamsters
union
was
in
november
1953.
district
50
was
not
on
the
scene.
the
employer
got
a
state
court
injunction
to
restrain
violence
and
picketing.
then
later
that
injunction
was
amended
to
permit
peaceful
picketing.
it
was
six
months,
almost
to
the
day
from
the
time
the
man
had
committed
--
that
bowman
had
committed
unfair
labor
practice
against
the
teamsters
when
district
50
appeared
on
the
scene.
district
50
and
no
particular
engaged
in
any
unfair
labor
practice.
now
the
counsel
for
the
board
is
wrong
in
saying
there's
no
provision
of
making
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
a
union.
if
a
union
coerces
a
man
in
their
choice,
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice,
i
believe
under
section
of
8
(b)
(1).
so,
we
have
a
perfectly
innocent
union.
now,
the
bowman
president,
suffering
from
teamsters
naturally
wanted
to
get
out
of
this
situation
he
was
in.
district
50
was
contacted
by
some
bowman
employee
and
then
they
informed
mr.
bowman
that
they
represented
the
majority.
the
board
seemed
to
think
that
when
mr.
bowman
believed
the
representative
of
district
50,
that
he
was
wrong
in
believing
that
an
honorable
man
was
telling
the
truth.
that
he
should
have
demanded
then
to
see
the
cards.
he
used
a
method
of
calling
his
man
in.
when
the
man
came
in
the
regional
director
of
district
50
didn't
want
to
go
out
there.
he
wanted
to
have
the
man
come
to
gadsden,
this
all
that
happened
at
gadsden.but
the
president
said,
there's
a
man
in
here,
come
out
here
and
you
can
use
my
facilities.
now
that
was
the
extent
of
the
support
and
assistance,
letting
them
meet
out
there
on
his
premises.
now,
the
--
the
confusion
in
the
minds
of
the
board
and
of
counsel
for
the
board,
he
confuses
two
things.
he
confuses
a
board
conducted
election
with
a
board
certification.
there
are
cases,
one
happened
as
i
recall
in
alabama
where
a
state
agency
conducts
an
election.
we
have
utilized
the
services
of
preachers
and
priests,
and
i
believe
of
educators
in
supervising
and
checking
and
checking
cards.
the
certification
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
expunging,
to
expunge
means
to
eradicate
from
the
mind
of
the
laborer.
now,
if
they
have
an
election,
the
election
would
be
the
indication
of
the
laborers'
state
of
mind.
the
certification
would
come
afterwards.
how
can
certification,
after
the
effect
has
been
eliminated
and
it's
been
demonstrated
in
an
election
by
the
men's
own
vote,
how
can
certification
have
any
part
on
the
mind
or
any
effect
on
the
minds
of
those
men
who
wanted
district
50
in
the
first
place?
now,
this
is
not
a
question
of
domination.
in
fact,
the
coercion
was
evidently
very
small
because
the
board
didn't
agree
with
the
trial
examiner
that
that
they
had
coerced
the
man
in
designing
to
check
all
cards.
the
board
disagreed
with
me.
it's
simply
a
case
that
the
board
failing
to
adapt
itself
to
the
changing
world.
the
chief
justice
discussed
that
before
the
university
of
indiana
in
november.
the
whole
problem
of
the
law
is
to
adjust
your
rules
to
a
changing
world.
in
the
--
under
the
wagner
act,
certification
--
mr.
crampton
harris
--
proper,
furthermore
familiar
with
the
practices
of
the
board
--
for
me
in
response
to
the
suggestion
by
mr.
justice
brenan,
that
the
board
has
respected
an
election
conducted
under
a
state
agency
and
declined
to
hold
the
board
election
within
a
year
thereafter,
a
fundamental
fallacy.
mr.
crampton
harris
we
can
give
you
that
exact
case
within
24
hours.
i
don't
have
it.
mr.
crampton
harris
no.
they
have
respected
one
that
--
was
held
and
it
was
brought
to
their
attention.
i
don't
think
they
ordered
such
an
election,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
or
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it.
mr.
crampton
harris
no
--
no
unfair
--
no
controversy
about
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
the
employer.
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
it's
wholly
unnecessary.
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
the
--
the
answer
is
found
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
before
you
ever
get
to
that,
their
fallacy
is
in
supposing
that
because
district
50
elected
not
to
file
the
affidavits
and
the
financial
reports
that
the
board
cannot
conduct
an
election.
the
board
can
conduct
an
election.
district
50
didn't
raise
this
question.
we
didn't
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice.
if
we
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
as
a
part
of
logic,
you
might
say
that
district
50
raised
the
question.
mr.
crampton
harris
i
can't
accept
one
--
one
statement
that
you
make
if
the
employer
in
this
case
dominated.
mr.
crampton
harris
he
--
he
intruded
--
mr.
crampton
harris
--
on
the
--
mr.
crampton
harris
yes.
mr.
crampton
harris
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
crampton
harris
we
couldn't
dispute
--
mr.
crampton
harris
i
stood
--
i
stated
not
--
i
don't
suggest
that
the
board
call
in
a
state
agency
to
hold
an
election.
mr.
crampton
harris
i
--
that
would
be
absurd
because
they
can
hold
it
themselves
and
run
a
segment,
trust
themselves,
doesn't
--
does
to
anybody
else.
mr.
crampton
harris
absolutely.
that
is
our
position
exactly,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
certification
is
merely
the
handing
a
diploma
to
a
man
who
has
already
completed
his
work
for
his
law
degree
or
his
college
degree.
mr.
crampton
harris
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
i
can't
say
what
mr.
lewis
would
like
--
mr.
crampton
harris
--
because
i
have
never
discussed
it
with
him.
mr.
crampton
harris
and
with
the
colossal
brain
that
he
has,
i
don't
think
i
can
read
his
mind,
at
least
not
enough
to
be
willing
to
state
to
this
court
what
he
thinks.
mr.
crampton
harris
he's
not
what?
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
when
men
get
into
jobs
of
such
great
magnitude,
like
the
members
of
this
court,
it
isn't
a
question
of
friendship.
it
isn't
any
personal
animosity
towards
the
members
of
the
board.
it's
a
question
of
broad
national
policy
of
rights
which
we
have
under
the
law
as
passed
by
congress
and
they
don't
acknowledge
them
and
we
on
proper
occasions,
try
to
bring
a
new
question
to
this
court
so
that
this
court
can
decide
it,
in
this
particular
case
while
the
board
brought
it
to
you.
we
chose
two
cases,
one
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
one
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
the
fourth
circuit,
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
of
premature
recognition
while
there's
a
question
concerning
representation
pending.
in
this
one,
you're
familiar
with
the
unfair
labor
practice.
the
fourth
circuit
in
that
case,
mr.
chief
--
the
chief
judge
parker
made
this
remark.
he
said,
"well,
the
men
who
--
the
unions
that
have
complied
are
not
here,
what
difference
was
made
to
them?
was
it
to
require
certification?"
they
would
have
to
prove
that
they
had
a
majority.
the
board
can
make
us
prove
it
and
the
court
below
said
the
only
thing
under
the
board
ruling.
they
didn't
use
that
phrase.
they
said,
"if
they
do
conduct
an
election,
district
50
will
not
be
on
the
ballot."
it's
been
done.
you
held
an
election
in
which
the
men
vote
whether
they
want
teamsters
or
no
union.
and
we're
not
on
it.
and
we
explained
to
the
men,
vote
no
union
then
nobody
is
certified.
now,
in
this
case,
the
board
can't
rest
on
the
room
while
district
50
raised
a
question
and
we
can't
conduct
an
election
because
we
didn't
raise
the
question.
in
order
to
raise
the
question,
we
would
have
to
file
a
charge
and,
"oy,
we've
been
gifted
an
unfair
labor
practice."
you
might
logically
say,
"well,
you
called
that
question
to
come
up,
but
we're
merely
exercising
rights
that
were
given
us
by
the
congress
in
a
carefully
studied
piece
of
legislation
and
the
amounts
in
that
law,
what
the
public
policy
was."
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
public
policy
to
guarantee
full
freedom
of
designation
to
the
man
in
full
freedom
of
choice
of
representatives.
and
when
the
men
have
that
right
for
this
board
to
say,
"we
would
go
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
congress."
these
men
down
here
want
district
50.
perhaps,
they
want
mr.
john
l.
lewis
on
account
of
his
reputation
for
strength
and
for
administering
his
welfare
fund
for
the
benefit
of
the
minor.
we
want
him
and
to
say
that
you
can
never
get
the
union
of
your
choice.
in
my
mind,
that
is
administrative
amendment
of
an
act
of
congress.
now,
it
won't
bring
any
pressure,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
on
the
--
the
unions
that
it
qualified,
if
i'm
correct,
because
they've
already
complied
the
five
affidavits
and
the
certificate
is
something
if
they
get
automatically
if
they
demonstrate
their
majority
in
the
election.
mr.
crampton
harris
if
they
decompiled,
that
wouldn't
take
them
out
from
under
the
board
election.
what
would
they
gain
by
decomplying
in
that
particular?
the
--
the
board
can
conduct
an
election.
they
are
wrong
in
saying
they
can't
conduct
an
election.
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
in
any
case
if
the
men,
100%,
they've
refused
to
vote
for
anything
anybody
wants
them
to
vote
on.
and
so
you
can't
correct
that
no
matter
what
you
do.
but,
if
the
board
conducts
it
and
every
man
there
votes
no
union,
then
the
teamsters,
say
they
asked
for
the
election,
they
can't
be
certified.
suppose
the
bowman
transportation,
bowman
asked
for
the
election
because
the
teamsters
say,
"we
want
it."
he
asked
it
and
the
board
conducts
the
election.
the
teamsters
don't
get
a
majority
and
the
board
does
not
certify
the
teamsters
to
(inaudible)
of
bowman.
then,
he
knows
that
evidently
his
men
want
district
50.
mr.
crampton
harris
i
would
--
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
i
had
that
question
asked
me
by
judge
(inaudible),
i
believe.
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
win
this
case
before
this
court
to
argue
the
validity
there
or
none
of
that
order
with
reference
to
a
complying
union.
mr.
crampton
harris
yes,
i'm
willing
to
discuss
that.
mr.
crampton
harris
the
--
i
used
a
wrong
phrase
a
moment
ago
due
to
my
inexperience
in
the
detail
to
this
labor
work.
the
election
they
conduct
is
--
it
would
be
--
the
ballot
would
be,
teamsters
-
yes
and
teamsters
-
no.
not
"no
union."
if
they
were
asking
for
an
election
where
the
teamsters
were
playing.
i
was
wrong
in
saying
it
was
both
teamsters
or
no
union.
that
--
excuse
my
inexperience.
the
situation
in
this
changing
world
grew
up
when
the
sections
9
(f),
(g),
and
(h)
were
added
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
under
the
old
law,
certification
was
not
subject
to
those
restrictions.
now,
when
the
taft-hartley
act
came
in,
the
board
blithely
went
on
applying
the
same
rule.
and
to
our
mind,
if
we
have
a
right
to
elect,
to
file
or
not
to
file,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
burton
and
the
court
made
that
point
clear
in
the
arkansas
flooring
case.
if
we
have
the
right
of
election
to
file
or
not
to
file
and
if
the
men
have
a
right
to
choose
a
union
that
has
not
filed,
then
the
board
by
no
form
of
contrivance
of
order
can
take
away
that
right
from
the
men
and
that
right
from
the
union
expressly
conferred
by
the
act.
now,
they
talked
about
something
incidental.
in
looking
up
incidental
in
webster,
the
phrase
meaning
that
it
gives
that
is
happening
as
a
chance
or
underlying
feature
of
something
else,
casual.
it's
not
a
prime
concern.
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
see
anything
undesigned
whereas
a
union
that
the
board
knows
has
never
filed
under
9
(f),
(g),
and
(h),
nor
did
the
determination
of
the
international
union
has
never
survived.
and
they
issue
an
order
which
says,
"because
of
the
state
of
your
mind,
because
you
insist
on
your
rights
under
the
device
of
this
order,
we're
going
to
put
you
out
of
business
down
here
and
you
will
never
be
able
to
represent
it."
and
if
they
could
do
it
in
that
instance,
why,
all
the
employer
would
have
to
do,
he'd
say,
"i
will
--
i
will
give
a
little
assistance
to
district
50."
whisper
it
to
the
other
union
and
let
them
file
an
unfair
labor
charge
and
then
i'll
never
have
district
50
again.
i
don't
know
whether
the
bowman
transportation
company
wanted
any
union
or
not.
its
in
the
--
they
might
have
been
figuring
they
were
taking
the
lesser
of
two
evils,
because
they
haven't
appeared
to
argue
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
haven't
appeared
here.
now,
if
the
order
of
the
board
was
wrong,
we
come
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
whittaker.
had
the
board
--
had
the
court
any
power
to
modify
the
order?
i
know
of
no
language
more
clearer
than
that
found
in
sections
10
(e)
and
(f)
of
the
act
where
it
gives
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
case
is
brought
up
to
them,
power
to
enforce
or
modify
and
of
enforcing
it
as
modified
the
order
of
the
board.
now,
you
can
say
it's
all
scripted
or
asked.
there
is
no
limitation
on
that
power,
except
if
there
is
any
substantial
evidence,
the
courts
have
to
regard
the
finding
of
the
board.
in
section
10
(e),
you
find
and
that's
where
a
party
brings
it
up.
in
that
section,
they
cannot
raise
any
question.
the
court
cannot
consider
any
question.
it
has
not
been
raised
before
the
board
of
the
agency.
now,
we
will
not
apply
it.
we
came
into
the
case
when
we
saw
this
order
which
would
put
us
out
of
business
and
gets
them
and
in
the
bowman
tracking
company's
operation.
we
then
filed
a
petition
to
review
under
10
(f)
which
provides
that
any
aggrieved
person
can
petition
the
board
or
the
court
for
review.
and
section
10
(d)
provides
that
so
long
as
the
board
hasn't
filed
the
record
in
a
court
to
ask
for
enforcement,
any
person
can
apply
to
the
board
for
them
to
modify
an
order.
we
came
in
that
way.
and
the
board
first
thought,
we
will
eliminate
them
because
they
didn't
take
exception
in
20
days.
the
court
below
found
that
we
were
not
a
party.
also,
the
board
withdrew
from
that
contention
and
our
power
under
the
statute
and
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
to
petition
them
for
modification
was
never
questioned
any
further,
the
stipulation
it
left,
the
20
days
in,
they
had
raised
that,
paragraph
(c)
was
eliminated
by
later
stipulation
and
by
order
of
the
court.
now,
to
my
mind,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
where
it
isn't
on
a
matter
of
fact
but
on
a
matter
of
law,
the
courts
have
the
power
to
correct
the
board.
they
have
the
power
to
modify
and
to
enforce
as
modified.
in
those
cases
that
they
cited
under
note
15,
on
page
32
of
their
brief,
where
you
find
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
courts
did
consider
modification
and
in
some,
they
did
modify.
the
first
time
the
board
named
the
teamster
--
the
charging
union
and
we
won't
punish
you
for
working
with
them.
then,
they
suggested,
add
or
any
other
union
and
the
cases
put
that
in.
then,
respondent
suggested
or
refrained
from
joining,
if
you
want
to.
and
to
put
that
in,
the
board
didn't
object
to
it.
you
find
that
a
--
then
a
gradual
change.
now,
we
didn't
ask
the
court
to
modify
the
notice.
mr.
judge
washington
said
that
we
didn't
offer
a
suggestion
to
the
board.
well,
we
didn't
because
we
hadn't
studied
their
opinion
intently
enough
to
know
what
to
suggest.
we
didn't
because
they
wouldn't
welcome
our
suggestion.
a
counsel
stated
in
the
court
below
on
argument
when
judge
washington
asked
him
that.
he
said,
"well,
we
might
as
well
face
it
if
they'd
suggested
that
we
would've
paid
any
attention
to
it."
and
furthermore,
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
if
your
rights
have
been
violated,
that
you
will
forfeit
a
chance
to
raise
the
question
unless
you
suggest
to
the
violator
some
other
way
to
proceed.
to
my
mind,
there
is
no
such
duty
to
enact
rules
for
the
board.
we
told
them
it
was
wrong
and
when
the
court
asked
us
what
we
would
suggest,
we
picked
from
the
language
of
the
board's
opinion,
until
the
man
has
the
union,
has
been
freely
chosen
in
an
atmosphere
free
of
the
improper
influence.
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
that
is
my
feeling,
but
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
crampton
harris
i
state
now
as
i
stated
in
the
board's
circuit.
i
felt
that
way,
but
i
don't
think
i
have
to
take
on
that
thing,
and
i
don't
have
to
argue
for
those
unions
that
went
the
other
way.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
--
a
practical
problem
due
to
the
facts,
due
to
the
changing
world
where
the
law
is
different,
the
situation
is
different.
and
we
say
that
if
this
court
as
time
and
again
said
that
the
board
must
fashion
its
orders
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
act.
the
act
says
that
and
you've
given
them
flexibility
and
now,
although
they
are
never
bound
by
principle
to
res
judicata,
they
say,
"we
want
stare
decisis
and
we
don't
want
to
adapt
our
remedy
to
the
actual
situation
in
the
business
world."
and
that
the
case
has
never
been
up
before
any
court,
except
the
fourth
circuit
and
this
court
below,
and
they
both
agreed
with
this
that
the
court
--
i
mean,
that
the
board
did
not
have
power
to
write
such
an
order.
it
is
a
new
case
so
far
as
any
arguments
ever
been
made
on
the
point
so
far
as
i
can
find.
i
haven't
found
any
case
in
any
court
where
this
question
has
been
raised.
when
it
was
raised,
it's
significant
that
both
courts
agree
that
the
order
is
not
proper
or
it's
not
appropriate.
it's
absolutely
far
on
duty,
intent
and
policy
of
the
act.
now
then,
we
may
--
seem
to
the
board
to
be
obstreperous.
most
people
who
fight
for
their
rights
are
not
well
received
by
the
people
with
whom
they
fight.
but
if
we
didn't
fight
for
our
rights,
if
men
want
--
willing
to
litigate
for
their
rights,
there
wouldn't
be
any
use
of
me
standing
up
here.
and
the
president
wouldn't
have
to
go
over
the
entire
bar
of
america
to
pick
out
nine
intellectual
such
as
yourself
to
decide
questions
that
men
who
believe
fighting
for
their
rights
is
a
proper
practice.
now,
it
maybe
either
in
that
sense,
we
are
not
friendly
to
the
board
but
there
isn't
anything
personal.
i
don't
feel
that
there
is
any
necessity
for
me
to
cast
aspersions
on
the
board,
for
me
to
throw
bricks
at
anybody.
they
made
a
decision
with
which
we
disagree
and
the
court
below
agreed
with
us
instead
of
the
board.
thank
you.
