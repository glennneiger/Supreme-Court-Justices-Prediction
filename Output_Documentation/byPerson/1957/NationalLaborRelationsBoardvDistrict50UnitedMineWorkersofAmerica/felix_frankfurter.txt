are
you
saying
the
question
--
that
question
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
condition
that
you
make
accordingly.
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
the
national
hasn't
filed
and
therefore
the
local
can't
invoke
the
board's
facility
is
unrelated
to
the
remedy
which
is
your
argument,
isn't
it?
it's
unrelated
to
the
remedy
that
the
board
has
to
impeach
to
employee
because
of
the
employer's
violation
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
essence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
if
the
argument
as
it
is
that
this
kind
of
things
--
this
kind
of
remedy
enforced
against
noncomplying
unions
in
effect
may
operate
or
will
operate
in
the
kind
of
pressure
upon
a
noncomplying
union
and
free
not
to
comply.
that's
the
argument,
isn't
it?
i
wonder
whether
the
arguments
--
there's
note
that
cover
the
complying
union
because
then
the
argument
to
be
made,
or
rather
they
could
deal
with
the
enforceable
provision
if
it
is
enforced
with
the
rest
of
the
complying
unions
by
decomplying
if
they
didn't
settle
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
should
think
pressure
or
influence
to
secure
decompliance
is
at
least
against
the
public
interest
as
any
incidental
pressure
to
comply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
you
--
can't
you
go
beyond
that
or
say
that
while
the
court
--
while
the
board
can't
compel
to
comply,
by
complying
to
noncompliance
is
a
matter
of
choice
of
the
union,
i
shouldn't
think
there
was
a
public
policy
to
encourage
noncompliance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
you
should
then,
if
i
may
say
so,
admit
that
there
may
be
an
argumentative
pressure
on
the
part
of
--
against
or
with
a
noncomplying
the
need
to
comply.
what
you
say
that
far
off
set
by
the
relevant
use
that
the
board
has
made
at
this
mode
of
enforcement
of
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
may
have
to
admit
that
maybe
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
exactly
what
--
is
it
that
the
board
has
ordered
such
a
non-board
election?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
that's
rather
important
to
me.
would
it
--
would
an
order
--
will
an
order
requiring
or
conditioning
or
would
an
order
finding
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
is
not
in
controversy
here,
i
figured,
i
mean,
before,
i
figured.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
--
would
--
would
an
order
by
the
board
in
order
to
rectify
and
correct
and
prevent
the
recurrence
of
the
continuing
influence
affect
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
requesting
that
some,
a
state
agency
make
an
election,
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
and
that
is
the
question.
suppose
they
did
it,
like
in
a
--
i
often
see
the
government
are
doing
this
that
i
think
are
unnecessary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
board
found
what
--
what
this
unfair
labor
practice
means,
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is
that
the
employer
in
violation
of
the
act
exercised,
intruded
into,
it
interfered
with,
dominated
for
its
purpose
the
action
of
the
employee.
and
in
order
to
see
it
that
that
influence,
that
illicit
influence
is
dissipated,
the
board
has
a
right
to
recommend
or
formulate
certain
measures.
and
one
of
the
measures
that
they
suggest
is
that
there
be
some
independent,
some
antiseptic
mode
of
determining
what
the
real
will
of
the
employees
is,
isn't
that
right?isn't
that
what
it
gets
down
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
we
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
something
the
law
forbad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it's
something
the
law
forbad
in
order
to
dissipate,
in
order
to
render
completely
nugatory
the
continuing
force
or
influence
of
that
illegality,
the
board
uses
its
head
towards
that
to
measure.
that
--
the
problem
was
offered
in
here,
when
as
the
evil
influence
or
the
illicit
influence,
i
am
not
using
evil
in
any
condemnatory
moral
sense.
i
am
talking
about
something
the
law
forbids.
and
the
board
says,
"we
want
to
get
the
free
willing
of
the
employee."
now,
they're
certainly
entitled
to
do
that,
aren't
they?
they
say,
in
order
to
be
sure
that
that
illicit
influence
doesn't
persist,
we
--
we
are
called
upon,
we
have
the
power
to
devise
ways
and
means
to
judge
that
that's
--
there
is
such
a
dissipation.
now,
you
suggest,
unless
i
misunderstand
you,
that
that
could
be
done
from
some
state
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
would
it
have
that
power
if
you
say,
"could
have"?
what's
the
basis
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
holding
an
election,
would
mr.
lewis
really
like
to
have
the
board
go
in
and
hold
elections
in
--
in
--
among
his
locals,
when
he
refused
to
have
any
trouble
with
the
board?would
he
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
wonder
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
that's
a
rhetorical
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
(inaudible)
to
imply
what
we
all
know
he's
not
friendly
to
the
board,
is
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
friendly
to
the
board
and
he
wants
to
do
business
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
could
be
complied
in
five
minutes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
the
board
in
this
case
has
could
conduct
an
election.
just
--
just
spell
that
out,
they
don't
extend
it
because
the
men
will
just
--
they
get
on
--
they
wouldn't
vote.
they
could
frustrate
that
as
a
matter
of
cause.
