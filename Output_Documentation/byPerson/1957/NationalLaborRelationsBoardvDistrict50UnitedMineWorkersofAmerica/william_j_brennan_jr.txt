justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
manoli.
the
board
may
deny
a
noncomplying
reason
with
the
use
of
its
facility.
may
the
board
in
anyways
compel
any
union
that
comply
with
the
requirements
which
condition
the
use
of
its
facility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
other
words,
it
has
no
authority
directly
to
compel
any
union
to
comply
does
is
t?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
isn't
there
involved
here
at
least
an
aspect
in
the
face
of
the
conflict
(inaudible)
of
pressure
by
the
board
upon
the
union
to
comply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
that
or
to
give
up
its
rights
which
otherwise
it
might
establish
legitimately
to
represent
the
claim,
now,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
--
let's
admit
that
but
the
board
has
never
taken
the
position
has
it
but
the
only
possible
evidence
that
a
union
and
cooperating
management
have
purged
themselves
respectively
of
devices
which
led
to
the
order
is
a
certification
by
the
board
after
an
election.
has
the
board
ever
taken
that
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree,
but
has
it
ever
taken
the
position
that
that's
the
only
way
to
purge,
maybe
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
different
from
the
usual
kinds
of
order
of
sometimes
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
get
us
into
trouble
in
different
kinds
of
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
board
has
also
for
over
20
years,
i
would
call
it
a
nice
partnership,
taken
the
position
that
in
many
other
ways
that
legitimate
--
the
right
of
representation
may
be
established
for
that
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
manoli,
has
there
been
any
cases
either
in
this
court
or
perhaps
even
in
the
board
where
the
question
has
been
raised
even
before
the
compliance
provisions
came
into
the
law?
whether
a
certification
requirement
went
further
than
it
was
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

--
was
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
manoli,
i
noticed
the
footnote
as
to
exactly
possess
every
court
of
appeals
which
has
considered
the
problem,
has
approved
the
boards
remedy
as
wholly
appropriate.
does
that
imply
that
the
issue
is
actually
been
raised?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
i
have
those
were
any
cases
where
the
board
has
not
used
this
form
of
voting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
the
board
decided
in
this
kind
of
situation
to
avail
itself
with
the
facilities
of
some
state
mediation
service,
like
for
example
in
service
of
new
york
and
with
the
others.
has
it
ever
done
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
i
mean
this
is
the
state
--
this
is
a
problem
of
enforcement,
isn't
it?
and
you
have
a
practical
situation
and
the
objective
really
is
to
be
satisfied
that
the
union
has
a
free
choice
that
this
election
of
60
days
test.
well,
i
state
the
mediation
board
supervised
an
election,
if
chosen
by
the
board
as
the
agency
to
do
it
is
there
limitation
upon
the
--
upon
the
board's
powers
to
make
use
of
that
in
an
enforcement
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
no,
but
i
--
what
about
all
these
cases
where
perhaps
within
the
board's
jurisdiction
but
for
one
reason
or
another
the
board
declines
jurisdiction
and
they
go
to
state
agency,
not
because
they
are
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
if
the
board
chose
to
take
the
cases
but
there's
too
many
other
things
to
do
and
the
board
doesn't.
and
there's
not
any
question
is
there
of
the
recognition,
given
the
results
of
election
supervised
by
state
agency
in
those
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
well
it
--
it
would
have
to
call,
i
don't
know
what
state
this
it,
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
--
do
they
have
a
state
agency
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
by
that,
mr.
harris
perhaps
this,
the
necessity
for
a
compliance
in
a
certification
proceeding
usually
arises
from
the
fact
that
district
50
or
the
union
that
wants
the
election
and
to
be
certified
invokes
the
processes
of
the
board
to
obtain
the
certification.
but
that
in
this
instance,
it's
not
important
whether
the
union
is
or
is
not
certified.
it
may
nevertheless
accomplish
its
objective
of
discovering
the
freewill
of
the
employee
by
itself
conducting
an
election
without
the
end
result
of
a
certification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose,
mr.
harris
on
the
basis
of
your
argument
that
should
be
sufficient
and
the
board
may
not
go
beyond
that
whether
the
union
was
complying
or
non-complying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to
argue
that
now.
