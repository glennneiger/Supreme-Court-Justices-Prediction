mr.
harris,
may
i
ask
you
please?
if
yours
had
then
a
complying
union,
then
would
you
concede
that
the
board's
order
was
a
valid
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
we
go
on?
if
the
board
did
have
power
to
adopt
the
order
that
it
did
adopt,
and
it
would
have
been
valid
as
against
a
complying
union,
then
you're
limited
here,
are
you
not,
to
a
discussion
of
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
had
power
to
alter
that
order?
now,
did
they
have?
are
you
going
to
discuss
that
in
your
argument?
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
power
to
rewrite
the
board's
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
