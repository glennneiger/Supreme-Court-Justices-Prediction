mr.

may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
under
the
certiorari
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
board
found
in
this
case
that
the
bowman
transportation
company
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
unlawfully
assisting
in
district
50
in
establishing
itself
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
company's
employees.
the
board's
order
in
relevant
part
requires
the
employer
to
withhold
recognition
from
district
50
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
its
employees
until
or
unless
district
50
is
certified
by
the
board
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
company's
employees.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
board
may
so
condition
the
future
recognition
of
district
50
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
company's
employees.
in
--
in
view
of
the
circumstance
that
district
50
has
chosen
not
to
comply
with
the
following
requirement
of
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
and
therefore,
the
board's
selection
procedures
are
not
available
for
the
purpose
of
determining
district
50â€˜s
representative
status
or
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
certification
by
district
50.
the
court
below
thought
that
the
board
(inaudible)
to
impose
this
condition
upon
the
future
recognition
of
district
50.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
question
may
be
summarized
quite
briefly.
in
1953,
the
teamsters
union
sought
to
organize
the
company's
employees.
the
company
was
opposed,
to
the
teamsters'
efforts
to
organize
its
employees
and
manifested
that
opposition
by
various
unfairly
labor
practice,
including
the
discharge
of
one
employee
which
contorted
treatment
of
another
who
had
supported
the
teamsters
union.
in
contrast
to
its
opposition
to
the
teamsters
union,
the
company
readily
adhered
to
suggestions,
had
a
deal
with
district
50
as
bargaining
representative
of
company's
employees.
shortly
after
these
suggestions
were
made
to
the
company,
the
company
--
and
what
i'm
about
to
say
took
place
within
a
week.
the
company
met
with
representatives
of
district
50
and
before
district
50
represented
a
single
employee
of
this
company,
the
company
and
the
representatives
of
district
50
negotiated
a
virtually
complete
contract,
covering
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
the
--
for
the
company's
employees.
thereafter,
the
company
at
its
own
expense,
summoned
from
various
terminals,
in
different
cities
throughout
the
south,
all
of
its
--
its
employees
to
come
to
company
headquarters
and
they
did
this
and
it
paid
--
it
paid
for
their
expenses
in
it.
when
the
employees
reported
at
the
company's
main
headquarters,
they
were
shown
the
contract
which
they
could
expect
if
they
selected
district
50
as
their
bargaining
representative.
thereafter,
the
employees
were
polled
by
the
company
openly
as
to
whether
they
desired
to
be
represented
by
district
50
and
all
the
employees
present
some
75
out
of
100
employees
of
the
company
indicated
that
they
wanted
to
be
represented
by
district
50.
in
addition,
the
company
also
offered
to
advance
the
money
for
the
payment
of
their
dues
to
the
union.
shortly
after
all
the
employees
had
signed
cards
indicating
that
they
wished
to
be
represented
by
district
50,
under
the
circumstances
that
i
have
disclosed,
the
company
met
with
the
representatives
of
district
50
and
within
the
space
of
a
couple
of
hours,
they
consummated
or
signed
the
contract
which
was
virtually
identical
to
the
one
that
the
company
and
the
union
had
negotiated
before
the
union
had
represented
any
employee
of
the
company
and
also
was
similar
to
the
contract
which
was
shown
to
the
employees
when
they
were
told
that
this
was
the
kind
of
a
contract
they
could
expect
if
they
selected
district
50
as
their
bargaining
representative.
thereafter,
the
company
permitted
district
50
to
use
its
premises
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
some
union
business.
the
board
found
that
by
this
conduct
the
employer
had
assisted
district
50
in
establishing
itself
as
the
representative
of
the
employees
in
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board's
remedial
order,
fairly
in
standard
form,
requires
the
company
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
found
by
the
board.
it
requires
the
company
to
undo
the
discrimination
against
the
two
employees
who
had
supported
the
teamsters
union.
the
boards
order
also
requires
the
company
to
cease
giving
effect
to
the
contract
with
district
50.
it
requires
the
company
to
withhold
recognition
from
district
50
as
the
employees'
exclusive
bargaining
representative
until
such
time
as
district
50
is
certified
by
the
board
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
its
employees.
and
finally,
the
board's
order
requires
the
company
to
post
notices
for
60
days
in
substance
giving
assurances
to
the
employees,
that
the
company
will
obey
the
board's
order.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
this
charge
was
against
the
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
--
that's
correct,
the
employer.
there
could
be
no
charge
for
this
sort
of
thing
against
district
50.
statute
--
section
82
of
the
statute
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
employer
to
support,
assist
or
dominate
the
whole
organization.
the
court
below
approved
the
board's
unfair
labor
practice
findings
in
this
case
and
even
forced
the
board's
order
except
that
part
of
the
order
which
enjoins
the
company
from
recognizing
district
50
as
the
employers
bargaining
representative
until
such
time
as
it
is
certified
by
the
board.
the
--
the
order
as
now
modified
by
the
decree
of
the
court
below,
which
appears
at
page
64
of
the
record,
now
reads
as
follows,
that
the
company
shall
cease-and-desist
from
that's
in
paragraph
(d)
above
the
middle
the
page.
the
company
shall
cease-and-desist
from
recognizing
district
50,
united
mine
workers
as
the
representative
of
its
employees
and
i
will
skip
a
few
lines,
unless
and
until
the
said
labor
organization
shall
have
been
as
certified
as
such
represented
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
--
and
this
is
the
part
that
the
court
below
added
to
the
board's
order,
or
shall
have
been
freely
chosen
as
such
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
after
all
effects
of
unfair
labor
practice
have
been
eliminated.
the
--
as
i
have
said,
the
court
below
thought
that
board-like
power
to
condition
the
future
recognition
of
district
50
upon
a
board
certification
and
the
minute
they
ordered
in
this
fashion,
and
the
underlying
reason
which
the
court
gave
for
so
many
in
the
order
in
its
--
in
its
opinion
was
that
once
the
employer
has
complied
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
board's
order
and
has
posted
the
notice
required
by
the
order
for
60
days,
it
can
be
assumed
that
normalcy
has
been
restored
and
that
the
employees
will
then
be
free
--
will
--
would
then
feel
free
that
the
ill
effects
of
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
would
have
been
remedied
and
that
the
employees
will
then
feel
free
to
choose
district
50
as
their
bargaining
representative
but
without
the
necessity
of
a
board
election.
the
basic
problem
which
we
have
in
this
case
touches
of
course
upon
the
board's
power
to
choose
remedies
for
the
--
the
redress
of
unfair
labor
practice
and
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
the
statutory
policies.
the
board's
power
in
this
respect
stems,
of
course,
from
section
10
of
the
act.
section
10
of
the
act
empowers
the
board
to
require
any
person
who
is
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice
to
cease-and-desist
from
such
unfair
labor
practice
and
further
provides
to
take
such
affirmative
action
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
this
court
has
often
said
that
the
choice
of
remedies
for
the
correction
of
unfair
labor
practice,
for
the
purpose
of
effectuating
the
statutory
policies
is
primarily
a
matter
for
the
board's
expert
judgment.
and
then,
unless
the
board's
judgment
can
reasonably
be
said
not
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
statute,
unless
its
judging
can
be
said
to
be
arbitrary
or
capricious,
a
review
in
court
should
not
normally
disturb
the
board's
remedy.
now,
one
of
the
problems
which
has
confronted
the
board
throughout
its
history
has
been
the
problem
of
how
best
to
anticipate
or
neutralize
the
impact
of
an
employer's
domination
or
assistance
of
a
--
of
a
labor
organization
upon
the
employees'
freedom
of
choice
in
the
selection
of
the
bargaining
representative.
where
the
employer
has
dominated
the
labor
organization,
and
it
can
be
said
that
the
employer's
influence
has
so
corrupted
the
labor
organization
as
to
make
it
incapable
of
ever
been
--
of
ever
being
freely
chosen
by
the
employees
as
their
bargaining
representative.
the
board's
normal
remedy
is
to
require
the
disestablishment
of
that
union,
disestablishment
is
the
--
means
that
(inaudible)
never
served
as
the
representative
of
the
employees.
but
where
the
employer's
conduct
is
something
less
than
domination
as
in
this
case
where
it
--
where
it
consists
only
of
support
--illegal
assistance.
the
board
has
chosen
a
less
drastic
remedy
and
the
remedy
of
--
of
disestablishment.
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
now
applies
uniform
rules
as
to
whether
they
are
inside
unions
or
affiliated
unions.
if
it
finds
--
in
fact
it's
required
of
our
uniform
rules,
if
it
finds
that
the
union
has
dominated
the
board's
normal
order
whether
or
not
it's
an
inside
union,
or
company
union,
or
affiliated
union,
the
company's
normal
--
the
order
now
will
require
the
disestablishment
of
that
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
the
--
the
board
will
--
as
i
say
is,
that's
right,
that's
right.
i
don't
know
if
the
board
has
ever
heard
that
case.
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
you
--
[laughs]
we
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
was
about
to
say
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
so.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
less
drastic
in
this
respect,
that
the
board's
order
permits
this
union
to
purge
itself.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
will
never
be
certified.
now,
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
a
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
normally
less
drastic,
normally
less
drastic
because
i
think
first
of
all
we
must
address
ourselves
with
the
question
of
whether
the
board's
order
is
appropriate
even
in
the
case
of
a
complying
union.
i
think
we
must
establish
that
proposition
before
we
can
go
on
with
further
question
of
whether
the
order
is
all
right,
with
respect
to
a
noncomplying
union.
now,
certainly
with
respect
to
a
complying
union,
the
order
of
--
in
order
that
this
character
is
certainly
less
drastic
than
a
disestablishment
order
because
it
permits
that
union
--
it
permits
that
union
to
purge
itself
of
whatever
support
or
assistance
it
may
have
obtained.
and
it
permits
that
union
to
re-acquire
its
status
as
the
bargaining
representative
but
only
to
a
board
election.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
local
can
certainly
purge
itself
of
the
employer's
influences
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
doesn't
depend
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
upon
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
cannot
represent
the
--
it
cannot
represent
these
employees
in
the
future,
that
is
quite
correct,
your
honor.
unless
it
cannot
be
certified
--
cannot
be
certified
by
the
board.
unless
it
complies
with
the
following
requirements
of
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
that
is
their
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
cannot
represent
them
as
long
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
as
long
as
it
remains
out
of
compliance
and
cannot
therefore
invoke
the
board's
election
procedures.
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
the
statute
requires
the
national
with
which
it
is
affiliated,
is
also
required.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
so
far
as
this
establishment
is
concerned
until
or
unless
--
until
or
unless
this
company
files
with
the
--
files
--
until
or
unless
the
union
and
its
--
the
united
mine
workers
on
which
it
is
affiliated,
until
they
file
the
section
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
affidavits,
this
union
will
not
be
able
to
invoke
the
board's
election
procedures,
cannot
be
certified,
and
cannot
act
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
these
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
essence
of
all
of
these.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
board
may
not
compel.
that
question
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
has
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
argument
is
made
here
of
course
that
--
that
the
board's
order
compelled
this
union
to
comply
with
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
it
cannot
act
as
bargaining
representative
under
the
board's
order,
which
it
otherwise
might
be
able
to
do
if
it
had
not
--
to
see
this
assistance
from
the
employer.
it
cannot
do
so
unless
it
complies
with
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h).
and
the
argument
is
made
that
it
is
not
within
the
board's
problems
to
require
issuing
it
to
comply
with
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h).
but
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
board
is
not
concerned
with
whether
or
not
this
union
tells
or
does
not
comply
with
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
but
that
it
is
properly
concerned
with
how
the
effects
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
in
this
case
shall
be
remedied.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board,
your
honor,
has
pursued
this
remedy
for
nearly
20
years.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
hasn't
--
this
is
the
usual
kind
of
order
that
it
cited
in
the
case
of
that
sort.
now,
it
hasn't
done
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
of
any
language,
any
board
decision
where
the
board
has
said
this
is
the
only
way.
but
these
are
the
underlying
considerations
which
have
prompted
the
board,
which
have
prompted
the
board
to
use
an
election
device
as
a
means
for
permitting
a
union
of
this
kind,
a
union
which
has
in
for
--
assisted
to
re-establish
itself
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
true
where
there
are
no
unfair
labor
practice,
and
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
arkansas
oak
flooring
case
which
this
--
the
court
below
relied
on
we
think
erroneously
that
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
there
are
the
other
ways
of
a
union
establishing
its
representative
status
other
than
through
a
board
election.
but
i
submit,
your
honor,
what
the
--
what
the
court
was
concerned
within
that
case
was
not
the
problem
we
have
here.
there
was
no
question
there
of
unfair
labor
practice,
of
assistance,
or
illegal
assistance
to
a
union
and
were
(inaudible)
that
there
are
unfair
labor
practices.
the
board
has
illegal
assistance
as
in
this
case.
the
board
has
felt
that
an
election
was
essential
in
order
to
anticipate
the
compulsions
which
flow
from
them
as
far
as
illegal
assistance
and
in
order
to
permit
the
employees
to
make
--
to
support
their
convictions.

of
our
brief.
you
will
see
that
a
collection
of
cases
there
in
which
this
type
of
order
was
passed
upon
by
at
least
eight
circuit
courts
of
appeals
including
the
court
of
--
the
court
below.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
footnote
15,
your
honors,
as
i
recall.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
no,
they're
not.
there
are
only
two
courts
that
have
passed
upon
this
noncomplying
union.
one
is
the
court
below
and
the
other
one
is
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
while
the
board's
order
was
so
unlike
with
respect
to
a
complying
union,
it
did
not
believe
the
board's
order
was
proper
with
respect
to
a
noncomplying
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
has
been
raised
in
the
number
of
those
cases.
i
will
not
say
it's
been
raised
in
everyone,
but
in
the
board's
order
and
at
least
in
some
of
those
cases
has
been
challenged.
in
fact,
i
remember
quite
well
that
it
was
challenged
in
the
second
circuit
in
a
case
which
we
cite
here
since
i
had
a
hand
in
reaching
that
case.
but
it
has
been
challenged,
your
honor,
and
some
of
those
cases
and
despite
the
challenge
it
has
been
--
it
has
been
approved.
and
as
they
say
the
underlying
--
the
underlying
consideration
of
that
remedy
is
that
the
board
feels
that
where
an
employer
has
assisted
a
union,
that
there
are
certain
compulsions
that
flow
from
that
assistance.
and
then
unless
the
employees
have
the
private
--
are
permitted
to
express
their
convictions,
in
a
--
by
way
of
an
election
under
appropriate
safeguards
that
the
employees
may
be,
as
this
court
held
to
be
--
held
to
their
choice
by
the
force
of
a
continuous
habit.
the
election,
of
course,
that
i
hardly
need
to
emphasize
ensures
the
employees
against
the
disclosure
of
their
names
and
moreover
it
tends
to
dispel
any
fears
of
reprisals
which
they
may
have
in
case
they
were
required
to
disclose
to
a
union,
which
they
have
identified
with
management
whether
or
not
they
wished
be
represented
by
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
know
of
none,
your
honor.
i
know
of
none
whether
there's
been
an
assistance
of
this
kind.
in
fact,
i
may
add
that
in
certain
cases,
the
board's
order
has
gone
even
beyond
the
order
of
this
kind,
where
for
example
an
employer
by
--
has
shown
by
a
succession
of
company
assisted
or
company
dominated
unions
has
shown
what
the
board
has
described
as
a
--
an
election
for
company
dominated
union,
the
board
has
not
permitted
the
employer
to
recognize
any
union
until
a
board
election.
but
here,
the
--
ordered
merely
enjoins
the
company
from
recognizing
district
50
as
the
employees'
bargaining
representative.
now,
i've
already
indicated
that
the
board
has
pursued
this
remedy
for
more
than
20
years
and
i
think
it's
not
entirely,
rather
significant
that
the
board's
judgment
has
been
such
for
20
years.
i've
also
indicated
that
at
least
eight
circuit
courts
of
appeals
has
approved
this
type
of
order
in
connection
with
any
assisted
complying
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
conceivably,
the
board
might
--
we
ran
into
problems
of
preemption
of
course
here.
but
the
board
normally
will
insist
upon
its
own
election
carried
under
its
own
safeguards.
your
honor,
has
in
mind,
i
suppose
an
election
by
some
state
agency?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
an
election
by
whom,
your
honor,
if
i
may
ask?
just
as
i
defend
--
my
answer
depends
upon
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
an
election
conducted
on
the
supervision
of
the
union?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
itself
--
the
board
itself
has
felt
it's
precluded
from
conducting
an
election
by
section
9
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
a
matter
of
power,
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
board
has
felt
that
in
section
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
precludes
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
today,
your
honor,
we
may
very
easily
run
into
problems
of
preemption.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
conceivably
i
suppose
the
board
might.
i
don't
see
if
the
boards
could
direct
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
do
know
of
at
least
one
case
where
the
board
has
given
recognition
to
that
kind
of
an
election
but
as
a
matter
of
grace,
shall
i
say
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
alabama.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
and
the
further
argument
is,
your
honor,
that
if
this
order
is
valid
as
to
a
complying
union
and
--
but
it
should
be
--
and
is
not
valid
with
respect
to
a
noncomplying
union,
it
produces
the
somewhat
paradoxical
result
that
the
noncomplying
union
is
in
a
better
position
than
the
complying
union.
and
certainly
--
certainly
this
is
contrary,
we
think,
to
the
underlying
scheme
of
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h).
and
let
me
also
emphasize,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
this
union
is
not
in
compliance,
that
the
incidental
effect
of
this
order
may
be
to
require
to
comply
with
the
--
with
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h),
and
that
that
should
not
make
any
difference
because
as
this
court
has
set
in
the
arkansas
flooring
case,
that
while
a
noncomplying
union
may
enjoy
certain
statutory
benefit,
for
example,
represent
the
employees.
if
it's
freely
chosen
without
a
board
election,
without
board
certification,
or
without
compliance
to
section
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
nevertheless,
this
court
repeatedly
emphasized
in
the
arkansas
flooring
case
that
noncompliance
does
not
serve
to
exempt
the
union
from
the
sanctions
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
certainly
is
not
and
let's
say
the
union
finds
itself
in
this
predicament.
the
union
finds
itself
into
this
predicament
only
by
its
--
by
its
willing
cooperation
with
the
employer
in
its
unlawful
conduct.
it
may
be
said
in
a
manner
of
speaking
that
the
union
carries
the
key
to
its
dilemma
in
its
own
pocket
here.
it's
failure,
its
unwillingness
--
it's
unwillingness
to
use
that
key
should
not
serve
to
exempt
this
union
from
what
is,
be
otherwise
an
appropriate
remedy
that
the
board
has
adopted.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
think
that
it
is
imperative
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
of
course
but
it
is
imparative
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
actually
can
not
be
sure
that
this
is
in
purge,
your
honor,
because
of
course.--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
--
there
is
that
effect,
that's
right.
but
that
--
this
court
has
occasionally
the
interest
of
the
employees
must
be
subordinated
to
either
with
the
larger
objective
of
the
statute
is.
a
very
easy
example
of
that
sort
of
thing,
i
think
is
in
--
is
in
--
is
apparent
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
ranks
qualification
number
of
years
ago
where
the
employer
--
employees
had
selected
a
union.
thereafter,
the
employer
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice
a
result
of
which
was
it
even
lost
its
status.
despite
the
loss
of
status,
the
board
will
require
the
import
and
this
court
enforced
this
order
in
the
bank
for
their
case.
the
board
will
require
the
employer
to
continue
to
bargain
with
that
union
in
spite
whatever
the
wishes
that
the
employees
may
then
be
in
order
to
undo
the
effects
of
the
unfair
labor
practice.
so
here
--
so
here,
there
is
a
certain
amount,
there
may
be
--
there
may
be
a
certain
amount
of
support
base
on
the
employees'
wishes.
but
we
think
that
it's
for
their
own
good.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
your
honor.
