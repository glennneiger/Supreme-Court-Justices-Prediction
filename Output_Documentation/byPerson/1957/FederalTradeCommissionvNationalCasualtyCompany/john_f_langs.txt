mr.
john
f.
langs
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to,
in
the
time
alloted
to
me,
to
bring
to
your
attention
certain
basic
issues
which
i
believe
are
fundamental
to
this
case.
this
case
involves
a
question
of
federal
control
of
insurance
versus
state
control
of
insurance.
we
are
joined
in
this
position
that
we
present
to
the
court
by
38
states
who
have
joined
in
the
amicus
brief,
of
the
state
of
michigan.
and
there
are
two
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
representing
96%
of
the
legal
reserve
life
insurance
companies
of
the
country
and
80%
of
the
accident
and
health
insurance
business
of
the
country.
the
federal
trade
commission
assumes
two
positions
which
we
believe
are
not
proper
in
this
case.
it
first
of
all
assumes
that
by
innuendo,
if
not,
by
direct
comment,
that
the
insurance
companies
operate
in
this
country
without
control
or
regulation.
they
also
apparently
assume
and
i
quote
from
page
29
of
their
brief
which
--
and
they
have
used
this
as
a
pretext
in
our
opinion
for
taking
the
position
which
they
have
that
there
has
been
widespread
evidence
that
the
phenomenal
growth
of
the
accident
and
health
insurance
business
has
been
accompanied
in
many
instances
by
false
and
misleading
advertising.
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
and
of
the
insurance
industry
of
our
country,
we
object
to
this
statement.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
kind
in
anyway,
shape
or
form
in
this
case
or
the
national
case
or
in
the
american
hospital
case
that
there
is
any
of
this
evidence
which
counsel
referred
to,
namely
thousands
of
letters
which
had
been
received.
not
one
of
them
or
any
testimony
pertaining
to
that
was
introduced
in
our
case,
whatsoever.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
complaint
on
the
part
of
any
state
agency.
there
is
no
complaint
on
the
part
of
any
officer
of
any
company
that
they
had
received
any
information
pertaining
to
any
matter
that
was
deceitful
or
fraudulent.
insurance
business
is
built
on
service,
service
to
the
widow,
the
orphan,
the
sick,
the
injured.
it
has
paid
billions
of
dollars
in
claims.
it
has
been
in
business
in
this
country
since
the
inception
of
our
country.
no
business
can
--
can
succeed
for
long
unless
it
renders
service.
service
has
been
provided
by
the
insurance
companies
of
this
country
for
each
score
year
and
more
and
in
the
case
of
national
casualty
company
for
more
than
50
years.
i
simply
want
to
indicate
at
this
time
our
objection
to
the
use
of
a
position
which
is
not
a
part
of
this
case,
which
counsel
has
referred
to,
so
much
for
that
portion.
now,
i
believe
it
is
important
that
we
understand
a
little
more
fully.
some
of
the
justices
yesterday,
i
was
satisfied,
were
reaching
for
some
of
the
material
facts
and
historical
background
as
it
might
apply
to
this
case.
this
court
of
course
is
very
familiar
with
the
mccarran
act,
how
it
arrived,
how
it
arose.
in
the
southeastern
case
in
1944,
this
court
held
that
the
transaction
of
insurance
business
constituted
interstate
commerce.
prior
to
this
case
and
from
the
inception
of
the
--
our
constitutional
form
of
government
--
government,
all
insurance
business
had
been
regulated,
was
regulated
by
the
several
states,
each
having
a
department
of
insurance,
each
having
a
budget,
each
having
many
personnel.
without
question,
i
think
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
probably
one
of
the
largest,
and
probably
one
of
the
most
substantial
insurance
departments
of
any
state
in
the
united
states.
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
adopted
in
1945,
a
few
months
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
southeastern
underwriter
case.
there
are
three
sections
of
this
law
which
are
very
important,
and
the
law
we
believe
is
very
clear.
counsel
for
the
government
in
the
several
stages
that
we
have
gone
through
before
the
hearing,
the
hearing
officer
for
the
ftc,
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
brief
here
and
before
this
court
has
constantly
shifted
their
position.
i
can
understand
to
some
extent
why
that
would
be
done,
why
they'll
be
necessary
because
when
you
run
head-on
into
clear
precise
language,
it
takes
a
little
maneuvering
to
try
and
get
around
it.
section
1
of
this
mccarran
act
provides
this
that
the
congress
hereby
declares
that
the
continued
regulations
by
the
several
states
of
the
business
of
insurance
is
in
the
public
interest,
very
clear.
they
were
stating
that
the
regulation
of
insurance
shall
be
continued,
underlying
the
word
continue.
and
the
continuous
--
continuance
of
that
can
only
mean
and
be
the
continuance
of
the
law
as
it
was
applied
by
the
several
states.
section
2
(a)
of
this
law
states
this.
"the
business
of
insurance
and
every
person
engaged
therein
shall
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
several
states
which
relate
to
the
regulation
of
such
business.
the
business
of
insurance
and
every
person
engaged
therein
shall
be
subject
to
the
law
of
the
several
states.”
this
does
not
indicate
a
type
of
enforcement
and
i
will
comment
upon
that
later
on,
it
says
the
laws.
section
2
(b)
of
this
act,
which
is
the
passed
section
which
i
will
poke
a
portion
of
it,
“no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair
or
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance,
unless
such
act
specifically
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance.”
i
don't
know
how
congress
can
be
more
explicit
and
more
clearer
than
in
those
three
sentences
--
three
sections
of
the
law
to
state
that
it
shall
be
continued
by
the
states,
that
it
shall
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
states
and
that
no
act
of
congress
shall
apply.
then,
they
put
on
the
proviso
which
was
added
in
the
conference
hearing
between
the
senate
and
the
house,
provided,
the
federal
trade
commission,
and
i'm
using
only
the
federal
trade
commission
or
others
mentioned,
as
amended
shall
be
applicable
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
extent
that
such
business
is
not
regulated
by
state
law.
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
question
of
what
congress
--
what
congress
intended.
congress
knew,
this
court
knows
and
--
and
so
mentioned
in
the
prudential-benjamin
case
that
there
are
many
states
and
each
state
would
have
different
ideas
about
what
they
would
want
in
the
way
of
regulation.
congress
knew
that.
section
3
(a),
provided
for
a
moratorium.
the
moratorium
simply
states
that
this
act
shall
not
apply
until
after
the
moratorium
period
has
expired
and
then
only
if
the
states
do
not
have
law.
now,
in
the
congressional
debates
that
adopted
this
law,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
three
statements
and
three
only.
and
i
refer
to
the
brief
of
--
of
the
life
insurance
association
of
america,
the
amicus
brief.
they
have
it
set
out
fully
on
page
29,
the
bottom
of
page
29
and
the
top
of
page
30
and
a
portion
of
it
and
a
statement
on
31.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
particular
situation
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
debate
occurred
in
the
united
states
senate.
senator
mccarran
and
senator
ferguson
had
indicated
very
clearly
what
the
law
meant
and
senator
pepper,
i
was
not
satisfied
with
the
statements
that
it
might
mean
that
the
law
--
the
states
could
adopt
laws
which
the
federal
government
or
the
federal
trade
commission
might
believe
were
not
sufficient.
senator
pepper
states
this.
i'm
referring
to
and
a
directing
a
question
to
senator
mccarran.
“does
that
mean
that
after
january
1,
1948,
the
states
may
determine
whether
or
not
the
sherman
and
the
other
acts
become
applicable
to
the
business
of
insurance?”
senator
mccarran,
“the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.”
senator
pepper,
“apparently,
the
conference
report
goes
further
than
i
had
understood
it
to
go.
it
does
not
stop
with
a
moratorium
at
the
end
of
three
years.
at
the
end
of
three
years,
the
moratorium
would
continue
if
in
the
meantime
a
state
had
regulated
the
business
to
any
extent,
whatever.
that
would
defeat
the
supreme
court
decision.”
senator
mccarran,
“the
--
the
moratorium
would
not
be
continued,
but
if
in
the
meantime,
the
states
themselves
had
regulated
a
business
of
insurance,
the
sherman
and
clayton
acts
and
the
other
acts
would
not
become
effective.”
one
short
statement
by
senator
ferguson,
who
of
course
was
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
on
page
31
of
this
brief,
senator
ferguson
makes
this
statement.
“after
the
moratorium
has
expired,
if
a
state
has
not
legislated
on
the
subjects
covered
by
three
acts,”
and
underline
the
word
“legislative”,
“to
which
reference
has
been
made,
those
acts
shall
be
act
applicable
to
the
business
of
insurance.
but
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned
which
has
specifically
legislated
upon
the
subject,
the
three
acts
shall
not
apply.
and
then
senator
barkley,
summing
up
all
of
this
argument
on
the
last
day
before
this
bill
was
adopted,
and
this
bill
came
up
for
decision
and
then
was
put
over
for
consideration
for
one
day.
and
on
page
36,
we
find
his
statement
that
senator
barkley
made
and
suffice
it
to
state
in
his
very
long
statement.
but
he
stated
there
that
congress
still
retain
the
right
to
consider
this
matter
at
a
later
date
if
they
found
that
the
states
were
not
doing
that
which
congress
felt
they
should
do.
that
is
some
12
years
--
11
to
12
years
ago
and
there
has
been
no
act
in
congress
since
that
time
to
amend
or
change
that
law.
our
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
no,
your
honor.
all
states
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
--
have
legislated
now
in
different
forms.
mr.
john
f.
langs
on
this
particular
subject,
in
different
forms.
we
contend
there
are
--
the
model
bill
itself
has
been
adopted
by
some
40
some
states
and
there
are
--
and
the
other
states,
they
have
either
adopted
the
new
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
by
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
or
they
have
other
laws
which
are
applicable.
so
that
today,
the
national
casualty
company
which
is
engaged
in
the
accident
and
health
business
and
has
been
admitted
to
do
business
in
all
48
states,
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
those
48
states
to
the
extent
that
if
we
engage
in
any
improper
conduct,
their
license
as
well
as
the
license
of
their
agents
can
be
revoked.
and
there's
no
question
about
that,
whatsoever.
it's
not
easy
to
obtain
a
license
in
all
48
states.
it
is
something
that
many
insurance
companies
do
not
obtain.
in
the
case
of
national
casualty,
they
have
and
have
for
many
years,
a
license
do
be
business
in
all
48
states,
the
district
of
columbia
and
hawaii.
mr.
john
f.
langs
district
of
columbia
has
the
model
bill.
it
has
a
bill
specifically
which
was
approved
by
the
president,
i
think
on
the
22nd
of
february,
1958.
that
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
1958,
this
year.
mr.
john
f.
langs
the
model
bill
was
attached
to
a
copy
of
it.
you
will
find
attached
to
the
petitioner's
brief
and
you'll
also
find
this
copy
attached
to
the
american
hospital.
mr.
john
f.
langs
the
particular
provision?
on
page
67
of
the
respondent's
brief,
you
will
find
the
--
one
of
the
model
bills
which
was
taken
from
the
state
of
kansas,
and
provides
for
unfair
methods
of
competition
or
unfair
and
deceptive
acts
or
practices
which
are
prohibited,
and
there,
they
are
listed.
your
honor
does
not
wish
me
to
read
that.
mr.
john
f.
langs
yes.
mr.
john
f.
langs
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
very
much
so.
the
national
sells
only
trough
its
agents
that
is
licensed
in
all
of
the
states,
and
the
advertising
which
it
makes
up
is
made
up
only
for
agents.
and
the
advertising
material
goes
to
the
agents
and
is
disseminated
by
the
agents.
and
even
to
the
extent
as
the
record
shows,
something
less
than
5%
which
goes
direct
to
people
in
a
particular
state.
it
goes
there
at
the
request
of
an
agent.
national
does
not
do
any
direct
mail
advertising
on
its
own
accomplishments.
mr.
john
f.
langs
there
are
four
--
i
believe
there
are
43
or
44
states
that
have
the
model
act
at
the
present
time
and
then
more
has
been
adopting
more
right
along.
mr.
john
f.
langs
yes,
your
honor,
very
definitely
so,
very
definitely.
mr.
john
f.
langs
every
state
of
the
union.
if
this
company
engaged
in
any
of
practices
which
we
have
been
charged
with
here,
and
that
the
action
was
brought
by
anyone
of
the
states
and
they
found
this
to
be
true
which
they
could
not
under
the
--
but
that
fact
is
not
here
before
this
court.
our
license
could
be
immediately
revoked
and
the
license
of
all
of
our
agents
could
be
immediately
revoked
in
every
state,
the
district
of
columbia
and
hawaii.
mr.
john
f.
langs
right.
yes.
mr.
john
f.
langs
we
are
not
a
mail
order
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
under
two
decisions
which
this
court
has
handed
down
in
the
travelers
case
in
virginia
and
the
mcgee
case
where
this
court
held
and
sustained
the
service
of
process
by
mail,
against
insurance
companies
engaged
in
the
selling
of
insurance
by
mail.
i
think
that
the
--
the
state
would
have
definite
jurisdiction
in
those
two
--
because
of
those
two
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
if
i
understand,
your
honor,
correct,
the
--
the
question
was
asked
to
whether
or
not
take
the
case
of
virginia
which
was
the
travelers
case
and
where
mail
was
directed
into
the
state.
in
that
case,
this
court
sustained
an
action
brought
against
the
company
by
service
of
process
through
the
mail.
mr.
john
f.
langs
virginia,
going
to
the
state
of
california?
mr.
john
f.
langs
can
virginia
stop
that?
mr.
john
f.
langs
the
answer
is
definitely
yes.
virginia
does
not
have
to
permit
any
of
its
creatures
created
by
it
under
law
to
engage
in
any
deceitful
or
fraudulent
practice.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
there
would
have
to
be
somebody
doing
business
in
virginia
in
order
for
the
mail
to
come
out
of
virginia
and
to
the
extent
that
there
are
some
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
neither
would
the
federal
trade
commission
law
has
applied.
that
gets
then
into
the
silvers
case,
which
is
a
mail
case
strictly
and
purely
and
simply
and
not
a
--
not
an
ftc
or
an
insurance
case.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
your
honor,
i
will
not
check
into
the
question
of
television
or
radio
because
it
is
not
a
part
of
this
decision
of
this
case
because
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
yes,
because
our
--
the
position
which
we
take
in
our
case
where
we
are
subject
to
all
the
laws
of
the
state.
we
can
be
brought
to
the
bar
of
justice
any
place,
anywhere
and
we
do
not
do
any
television
or
radio
advertising.
but
should
we
do
television
or
radio
advertising,
we
can
be
reached
in
any
state
of
the
union
or
the
district
of
columbia
or
hawaii
without
any
question,
whatsoever.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
under
--
again,
i
am
engaging
in
a
supposition
with
the
court
because
of
something
i've
not
checked
up,
but
i
think
the
travelers
case
and
the
mcgee
case
probably
would
offer
that
state
the
authority
to
act
if
they
where
actually
making
sales
within
that
state
as
a
result
of
the
television
or
radio
broadcast.
mr.
john
f.
langs
no.
where
--
where
they
received
and
the
sale
was
made.
as
long
as
it's
made
at
a
point
where
the
company
is
located,
there's
no
question
about
the
control.
but
if
it
goes
into
a
state
as
i
understand
your
question
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
--
where
the
company
is
not
doing
business
and
not
authorized
to
do
business.
mr.
john
f.
langs
is
received.
well,
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
f.
langs
i
think
that
they
would
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
again,
prefacing
my
comment
that
we
have
--
do
not
have
that
issue
here,
but
it
would
seems
to
me
that
if
there's
a
contract
made
in
the
state,
it
would
fall
within
the
legal
language
which
this
court
has
announced
in
the
two
cases
i
have
mention,
because
there
is
a
contract
there
even
though
they're
not
authorized
to
do
business
there.
they
have
it
executed
and
entered
into
a
contract.
and
ordinarily,
a
corporation
is
not
permitted
to
go
into
a
state
and
engage
in
a
contractual
relation,
except
as
it
originates
outside
of
the
state.
so
that
the
both
states,
conceivably
under
those
circumstances,
either
states
could
interpose
an
objection
and
obtain
a
necessary
court
relief
in
the
federal
court
or
state
court.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
in
the
travelers
case
and
in
the
mcgee
case,
this
court
held
that
such
an
order
wasn't
forcible
against
a
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
right.
mr.
john
f.
langs
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
langs
the
federal
--
the
federal
court
system
covered
the
entire
united
states.
mr.
john
f.
langs
they
--
they
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
under
--
under
certain
circumstances,
yes,
definitely.
and
the
federal
system
covers
all
the
states.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
they
didn't
in
the
travelers
case,
because
of
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
directly
to
this
court.
mr.
john
f.
langs
i
don't
think
under
those
circumstances
you
would.
mr.
john
f.
langs
the
order
--
well,
the
order
--
an
order
presumably,
again
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
an
order
of
the
state
court,
of
course
would
be
subject
to
a
process
in
any
other
court
having
been
entered
in
the
state
of
new
york.
it
could
be
removed
and
transferred
as
a
--
as
a
cause
of
action
into
and
be
recognized
by
proper
court
proceedings
in
virginia.
mr.
john
f.
langs
yes.
mr.
john
f.
langs
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
as
i
understand
what
you
are
both
talking
about,
that
one
is
talking
about
something
a
little
different
than
the
other.
mr.
john
f.
langs
well,
because
your
honor
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
i
think
under
the
constitution.
mr.
john
f.
langs
it
has
no
right.
mr.
john
f.
langs
it
has
no
relevance
in
here
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
langs
it
--
it
has
no
--
it
has
no
relevancy
whatsoever
in
this
case
and
it
becomes
clearly
academic
and
under
the
constitution,
the
judgment,
orders
and
decrease
at
one
court
in
--
in
a
state
are
to
be
upheld
in
the
courts
of
another
state
where
action
has
been
properly
taken.
it
will
be
recognized
when
removed
and
acted
upon
by
another
court
in
another
state.
mr.
john
f.
langs
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
at
all.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence,
not
one
iota,
one
word,
one
scintilla
of
evidence
that
is
introduced
as
by
any
third
party
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
concerning
the
deception
of
any
activity
by
this
company.
and
of
course,
this
company
has
denied
that
be
enacted.
another
interesting
point
in
this
case
and
i'm
--
i'll
move
--
move
on.
i
can
probably
finish
my
points.
the
hearing
examiner
in
this
--
before
the
federal
trade
commission
took
the
position
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
in
those
states
where
there
were
laws
applicable
to
this
in
terms
of
question.
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
i
think
this
is
important.
the
federal
trade
commission
took
the
position
that
it
has
jurisdiction
irregardless,
i'm
underlining
the
word
“irregardless”,
of
state
law.
it's
quite
apparent
what
they
were
attempting
to
do
and
that
was
to
reach
fully
and
completely
around
the
subject
matter,
irregardless
of
state
law.
the
circuit
court
of
--
before
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
federal
trade
commission
contended
that
in
the
case
of
conflict
between
the
federal
and
state
law
that
the
federal
law
would
control.
and
the
circuit
court
of
course
held
with
the
hearing
examiner
on
this
jurisdictional
question
and
we
are
here
now
on
appeal
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
before
the
--
before
this
court,
the
petitioner
in
their
brief
on
page
23,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
makes
this
as
the
issue,
thus
the
issue
before
the
court
is
not
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
can
be
applied
so
as
to
overwrite
state
policies,
specifically
expressed
either
in
statutes
or
administrative
action.
congress
we
think
has
resolved
that
issue
in
the
negative.
the
issue
here
is
quite
different,
namely
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
can
be
applied
to
false
insurance,
inter
--
interstate
insurance
advertising
in
the
absence
of
such
conflict.
now,
they
have
stated
in
here
that
the
question
about
overwriting
state
policy
as
determined
and
set
forth
in
statutes,
and
i
underline
the
word
“statutes”
is
one
of
the
issues
which
has
been
resolved.
and
yet
before
this
court,
they
now
take
the
position
which
in
my
humble
opinion
is
a
unique
position.
we
state
now
that
the
state
law
is
completely
effective,
providing,
we
don't
get
in
first
and
that
is
the
net
effect
of
what
they
have
said
if
we
don't
get
in
first.
and
if
we
get
in
first
then
res
judicata
controls.
now,
laws
are
not
made
on
the
basis
of
a
footrace
and
that
is
exactly
the
position
in
which
they
find
themselves
as
this
time.
it
makes
it
rather
difficult
to
try
and
keep
up
with
the
changes
which
they
make.
a
moving
target
sometimes
is
difficult
to
hit.
now,
the
--
the
net
result
of
these
positions
is
this.
there
are
certain
fallacious
position
which
the
federal
trade
commission
has
taken.
and
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
those
in
detail,
mr.
wheeler
who
is
with
me
in
this
case,
representing
the
american
hospital.
he's
going
to
talk
about
that
for
his
portion
of
the
hour.
but
these
positions
become
fallacious
considering
the
law
as
congress
has
adopted
it,
as
the
senators
understood
it,
as
everyone
has
understood
it,
except
the
federal
trade
commission
in
its
reach
for
a
control
over
something
which
has
always
been
controlled
by
state
law
and
which
congress
says
shall
be
continued
in
the
states.
mr.
john
f.
langs
to
the
extent
that
is
very
clearly
defined
in
my
humble
opinion,
by
the
statements
which
i've
read
from
senator
mccarran
and
senator
ferguson
and
senator
barkley.
to
the
extent
that
these
states
have
adopted
laws,
which
are
applicable
to
insurance,
they
shall
continue.
mr.
john
f.
langs
but
--
and
if
it's
regulated
by
a
state
law,
there
must
be
some
legislation.
as
senator
ferguson
said,
but
so
in
--
but
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned
which
has
specifically
legislated
on
the
subject
matter,
the
three
acts
on
my
point.
mr.
john
f.
langs
as
has
specifically
legislated,
but
senator
ferguson,
on
the
point
i'm
making
is
--
senator
ferguson
and
senator
mccarran,
senator
barkley,
legislation
and
regulation
mean
the
same
thing
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
in
the
adoption
of
the
mccarran
act
and
can
mean
nothing
else
because
they
were
referring
specifically
to
the
laws
of
the
several
states
and
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
they
have
given
--
they
have
defined
the
powers
in
the
same
manner
as
the
federal
trade
commission
law
defined
certain
powers.
the
fact
that
the
federal
trade
commission
says
that
persons
shall
not
engage
in
deceptive
acts
and
practices
does
not
give
to
them
or
do
they
go
out
and
put
a
stamp
of
approval
on
everything.
they
only
act,
as
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
yesterday
as
the
prosecutor.
they
weigh
the
situation
and
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
act.
and
if
they
decide
that
they
should
not
act,
they
do
not
go
then
and
get
a
court
order,
get
a
federal
trade
commission
order
stating
that
it
is
all
right.
their
actions
are
in
the
form
of
prosecution.
mr.
john
f.
langs
the
constitution
when
it
says
it
gives
congress
power
to
regulate,
gives
power
--
gives
congress
the
power
to
enact
laws.
congress
can
only
speak
through
its
laws.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
state.
the
state
can
only
speak
through
its
laws
in
the
first
instance
and
then
to
a
department
or
bureau
has
allowed
them
to
set
up
certain
regulations
within
the
framework
of
the
law
which
it
has
adopted,
but
there
must
first
be
the
law.
mr.
john
f.
langs
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
it
in
the
--
of
course,
there
is
the
n.l.r.b.
situation.
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
question
of
which
item
shall
be
handled
before
the
n.l.r.b.
in
which
shall
belong
to
the
state,
where
they
--
where
they
shall
regulate.
that
is
not
clearly
defined
even
today.
in
this
situation,
however,
it
is
clearly
defined
and
the
congress
says
that
no
act
of
congress
shall
take
effect
or
supersede
an
act
of
the
state.
now,
there
is
that
difference
where
the
--
mr.
john
f.
langs
any
legislation
that
is
applicable
to
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
langs
it
must
be
applicable
to
insurance
of
course.
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
leave
the
rest
of
my
time
for
mr.
wheeler.
