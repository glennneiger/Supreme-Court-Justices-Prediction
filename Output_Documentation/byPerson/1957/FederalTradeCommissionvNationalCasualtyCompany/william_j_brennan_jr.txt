justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
position
also
is
even
the
48
states
commission
--
commissioners
did
(inaudible)
nevertheless,
there
is
a
federal
power
that
acts
as
the
commission
did
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
if
--
if
the
states
do
act,
you
mean
not
act
in
the
sense
as
i
understand
you
to
say
all
the
plea
have
acted,
that
is
by
adopting
statutes?
they
must
in
fact
attempt
to
reach
the
particular
case
and
if
--
if
that's
done,
that
would
be
a
defense
to
win
the
effort
on
the
part
of
federal
trade
commission
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
state
of
the
home
office
regulating
in
the
way
would
bar
the
use
of
the
mail
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
sending
it
through
the
agents
by
mail
in
each
of
the
other
47
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
was
my
question,
whether
the
state
of
the
home
office
could,
under
some
statute,
forbids
the
home
office
from
mailing
this
material.
of
course,
they
might.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
might
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
whether
the
mere
enacting
of
state
statutes
in
this
subject
is
regulation
or
not,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
mr.
spritzer,
in
the
national
case,
i
notice
that
this
order
is
directed
to
distribution
in
mississippi,
rhode
island,
montana,
missouri
or
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
didn't
you
say
to
us
earlier
that
at
least
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there's
no
such
regulatory
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
the
national
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
--
am
i
looking
at
the
wrong
order
at
page
202
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i
don't
know.
i'm
--
i
am
looking
at
an
order
where
it
seems
to
be
limited
in
its
application
with
the
state
by
name.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
was
that
it?
i
see.
all
right.
don't
let
me
waste
your
time.
go
ahead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
this
all
work
in
the
various
sherman
law
(inaudible)
those
are
the
other
statutes
in
addition
to
the
federal
state
commission
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
applies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
from
that,
i'm
--
i'm
just
wondering
what
there
is
of
the
sherman
act
area
under
the
proviso
in
2
(b)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
eliminates
the
sherman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
eliminates
the
sherman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
apart
from
the
area
covered
by
section
4,
what
is
the
lesson
in
2
(b)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
say
the
same
as
clayton
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
one
of
those
theories
early
(inaudible)
so,
we
have
one
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
is
some
implementation
or
enforcement,
yes.
now,
i
would
distinguish
between
an
active
legislation
which
is
self-executing
as
it
were
or
which
carries
some
immediate
criminal
penalty
and
a
statute
like
this
baby
federal
trade
commission
acts
which
does
no
more
than
delegate
the
authority
to
regulate
and
which
in
and
of
itself
imposes
no
sanction.
we
have
quoted
similarly
statements
from
the
two
other
senators,
both
of
which
emphasized
and
those
are
senators
ferguson
and
o'mahoney
emphasized
that
there
is
to
be
continued
room
for
federal
action.
both
of
them
contemplated
that
there
was
to
be
no
regulatory
board
either
because
the
states
couldn't
act
or
because
they
were
not
acting.
and
this
same
understanding
is
manifested
by
president
roosevelt
in
his
statement
in
signing
the
bill
where
he
speaks
at
page
65
of
our
brief
that
after
the
moratorium,
the
anti-trust
laws
and
related
statutes
will
be
applicable
in
full
force
than
the
effects
to
the
business
of
insurance
except
to
the
extent
that
the
state
had
assumed
the
responsibility
and
are
effectively
performing
that
responsibility.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
gather,
there
are
some
states
that
have
not
legislated
in
this
field,
are
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
--
on
this
particular
subject
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
situation
as
to
the
district
of
columbia
on
this
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
is
the
model
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
on
this
sentence,
what's
the
--
what
is
the
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
just
--
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
business
of
advertising
is
included
as
one
of
the
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
adequate
in
your
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
the
use
of
the
word
adequate
if
you
would
say
what
this
adequacy
means
in
the
business
of
