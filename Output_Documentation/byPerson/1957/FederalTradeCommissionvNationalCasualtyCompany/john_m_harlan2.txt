in
--
in
other
--
in
other
words,
you
--
you
--
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
as
to
these
states,
if
they
chose
to
act,
they
could
give
identically
the
same
relief
that
the
federal
trade
commission
could
give.
justice
john
m.
harlan
within
their
state
boarder
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
yes,
exactly.
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that's
the
way
i
understood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
think
the
state,
if
the
federal
trade
commission
took
affirmative
action
and
the
state
of
new
york,
for
example,
said,
“well,
we
don't
agree
and
we
will
--
we
want
this
advertising
in
new
york,”
that
they
could
overrule
the
federal
trade
commission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
if
the
federal
trade
commission
stepped
in
at
this
stage
of
the
matter
and
started
complaints
against
--
in
every
state
involving
companies
selling
in
all
states
of
the
union
that
would
--
that
would
preempt
the
matter
from
the
states,
any
of
those
states,
do
you
think?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
--
yet,
even
as
to
that
kind
of
jurisdiction
which
you
claim,
the
federal
trade
commission
would
have
had
no
jurisdiction
whatever
during
the
moratorium
period,
would
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
it
was
contemplated
that
after
the
moratorium
ended,
this
jurisdiction
still
subsist
with
your
documents,
despite
the
passage
of
state
laws?
