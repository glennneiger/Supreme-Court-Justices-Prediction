mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
consolidated
cases
come
here
on
the
government's
petitions
from
decisions
of
the
sixth
and
fifth
circuits
respectively.
the
question
which
they
present
is
whether
the
federal
trade
commission,
in
circumstances
which
i
shall
detail
later,
has
been
ousted
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
of
its
jurisdiction
to
issue
cease-and-desist
orders
directed
against
unfair
and
deceptive
advertising
by
insurance
companies.
before
i
sketch
the
essential
fact
of
these
two
cases,
i
should
like
to
take
a
very
few
minutes
to
state
by
way
of
introduction
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
been
engaged
these
past
several
years
in
a
very
active
campaign
to
eliminate
from
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
false
and
deceptive
advertising
by
companies
selling
hospital
health
and
accident
insurance.
there
have
been
some
41
cases
brought,
many
of
them
against
major
companies
and
there
are
various
stages
of
development,
the
two
here
today
being,
of
course,
the
first
to
reach
this
court.
they
are
important
in
the
commission's
view,
these
two
cases,
not
only
because
they
will
determine
in
very
large
measure
the
phase
of
the
remaining
cases,
but
also
because
the
general
situation
which
has
given
rise
to
all
of
these
41
proceedings
is
one
which
the
commission
deems
of
both
pressing
and
truly
national
concern.
and
that
is
so
because
health,
hospital
and
accident
insurance
have
grown
so
spectacularly
in
recent
years.
it
appears,
for
example,
that
more
than
two
thirds
of
all
persons
in
the
united
states
now
carry
some
form
of
hospitalization
insurance.
and
these
forms
of
insurance
are
sold
in
very
great
part
by
companies
which
do
business
on
a
broad
frequently
national
scale.
some
of
them
selling
on
a
strictly
mail
order
basis,
others
by
other
techniques.
moreover,
these
companies
more
and
more
have
come
to
employ
techniques
of
mass
advertising,
in
some
cases,
by
television
and
radio
or
through
national
periodicals.
and
as
i
suppose
everyone
who
has
a
mailing
address
is
where
many
of
them
has
employed
the
techniques
which
the
advertising
business
refers
to
as
saturation
mail
advertising.
it
was
a
consequence
of
the
--
in
consequence
of
this
that
mr.
howrey,
the
then
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
1955,
advised
the
house
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
and
i
quote
his
words,
“there
has
been
more
public
interest
in
our
investigation
of
this
advertising
than
any
investigation
the
commission
has
undertaken
in
my
memory.
we
got
not
hundreds,
but
thousands
of
letters
of
complaint
and
the
public
interest
in
response
have
been
overwhelming.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
am
reading
from
a
house
report.
it
is
not
quoted
in
our
brief,
your
honor
--
your
honor.
and
i
might
add
that
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
before
whom
mr.
howrey
was
appearing,
then
replied
that
it
was
the
conviction
of
the
committee
that
there
was
a
very
great
need
for
federal
trade
commission
action
for
the
benefit
of
the
companies
insured.
now,
with
this
background,
i
turn
to
the
facts
of
these
two
particular
cases.
national,
the
respondent
in
435,
is
incorporated
and
has
its
home
office
in
detroit,
michigan.
it
has
350
to
400
agents
who
are
located
in
all
48
states
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territory
of
hawaii.
it's
licensed
to
do
business
in
all
of
those
jurisdictions.
it
sent
some
brochures
and
advertising
materials
directly
from
detroit
to
people
throughout
the
country
who
maybe
prospective
buyers
of
insurance.
however,
the
great
mass
of
its
material
is
apparently
sent
out
in
both
ways
to
the
agents
and
they,
in
turn,
from
such
lists
as
they
have
or
accumulated
or
accumulate,
disseminate
to
the
public.
national's
advertising
materials
challenged
by
the
federal
trade
commission
complaint
in
this
case
had
been
in
use
for
two
years
or
more
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
the
complaint
charged
and
the
commission
found
that
they
were
deceptive
in
some
five
major
respects.
i
shall
just
quick
and
very
briefly
since,
as
i
indicated
in
a
moment,
our
issue
here
is
jurisdictional
rather
than
factual.
the
commission
charged
and
found
that
national's
advertising
first
conveyed
that
the
purchaser
of
the
insurance
could
continue
to
renew
this
form
of
the
insurance
as
he
grew
older
and
hence,
obtained
lifetime
protection,
whereas
in
fact,
the
policy
has
actually
provided
that
they
were
cancellable
at
the
option
of
the
company.
two,
the
ads
misrepresented
the
physical
standards
which
the
applicant
for
insurance
had
to
meet.
three,
they
misrepresented
that
the
insured
receives
broad
and
complete
coverage
in
relation
to
hospitalization
expenses
and
fixed
--
sick
benefits.
there
are
being
in
fact
numerous
exceptions
and
qualifications
in
policies.
four,
they
misrepresented
the
amount
of
benefit
payable
in
the
event
that
the
ensured
had
to
go
--
undergo
surgery.
five,
they
misrepresented
the
duration
of
monthly
sick
benefits.
american,
the
respondent
in
436,
is
incorporated
and
has
its
home
office
in
texas,
it
does
business
selling
health
and
accident
insurance
in
14
states
where
it
--
it
has
applied
since
then,
has
agents.
it
sends
its
brochures
and
advertising
materials
similarly
across
state
lines
to
its
agents
who
in
turn
distribute
to
the
public.
i
shan't
detail
the
representations
involved
in
the
american
case,
suffice
it
that
they
also
relate
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
policy
and
to
the
coverage
which
they
provided.
the
commission
in
american's
case
found
four
out
of
five
categories
of
violations
charged
has
been
proved.
now,
as
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
these
two
cases,
which
is
the
only
issue
that
the
court
below
reached,
let
me
note
briefly
one
or
two
following
additional
facts.
national
alleged,
and
this
is
conceded,
that
the
jurisdictions
in
which
it
does
business
with
the
exception
of
three
states
and
the
district
columbia
have
statutes,
have
state
statutes
under
which
the
respective
commissioners
or
departments
of
insurance
might
proceed,
might
issue
cease-and-desist
orders.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
a
showing
that
any
of
these
states
have
considered,
ruled
upon
or
proceeded
in
any
way
in
relation
to
any
of
the
practices.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
are
what
have
been
--
what
has
been
called
often
times
little
federal
trade
commission
acts.
and
they
authorized
administrative
agents,
normally,
the
commissioner
of
insurance,
to
issue
complaints,
to
conduct
hearings
and
to
enter
cease-and-desist
orders.
they
are
patterned
on
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
and
41
states,
which
have
such
statutes,
are
identical
with
one
another
and
all
of
them
speak
of
unfair
practices
and
deceptive
acts
and
practices
in
language
virtually
identical
with
the
ftc
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
within
--
within
their
state
boarder.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
both
parties
are
in
agreement
as
to
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
only
question
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
the
--
the
only
question
here,
sir
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
correct
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
your
honor.
the
--
the
states
can
certainly
act
in
all
events
and
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
arm
is
impotent
in
circumstances
where
the
states
have
statutes
but
haven't
undertaken
any
regulation
in
implementation
of
those
statutes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
inference.
i
think
we
--
that's
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
certainly
there
are
no
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it's
not
restricted
to
the
mails.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
let
--
may
i
--
i'd
better
clarify
our
point.
interstate
commerce
is
clearly
involved
because
all
of
these
advertising
materials
emanate
from
the
home
offices
and
then
go
to
agents
who
in
turn
distributes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
not
--
in
these
cases,
we
have
the
ads
sent
by
mail
or
perhaps
by
railway
express,
the
materials
in
any
event
across
state
lines
to
the
agents
who
in
turn
distribute.
in
national,
there
may
be
some
direct
mailing
from
the
home
office,
but
we
think
that's
--
that's
immaterial
for
--
for
our
purposes.
and
our
--
our
basic
position,
which
i
shall
be
able
to
point
out
in
a
moment
when
i
referred
to
the
statutes
is
simply
that
so
long
as
the
state
has
not
acted,
there
is
no
exclusion
of
the
federal
trade
commission's
power,
no
divestiture
of
its
power.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
using
action
in
the
sense
of
active
regulation
as
distinguished
from
the
mere
enactment
of
a
statute
which
in
this
case
is
really
an
enabling
act.
the
statute
--
none
of
the
state
statutes,
like
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
none
of
them
contained
any
sanctions.
they
just
give
the
authority
to
regulate
to
a
commission.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
and
only
if
the
administrative
machinery
is
therefore
brought
into
play
and
ultimately
a
cease-and-desist
order
issue
is
there
any
sanction
because
the
cease-and-desist
order,
of
course,
operates
only
prospectively.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
national
case,
approximately
5%
of
the
ads
are
sent
out
from
the
home
office
in
detroit,
the
other
95%
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
directly
to
prospective
purchasers
of
insurance.
the
balance
of
the
material
is
sent
across
state
lines
to
the
agents
who
--
who
engage
in
distribution
of
the
materials
in
their
respective
local
area.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
can
certainly
conceive
of
cases
in
which
that
would
be
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
for
example,
the
mail
order
insurance
company,
it
might
be
that
many
states
would
be
helpless
to
reach
the
material
coming
into
play.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
there
is
no
question
that
the
states
on
the
facts
of
these
cases
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
could
proceed
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
48
states
could
enter
48
cease-and-desist
orders
against
national.
our
factual
situation
is
that
not
one
of
the
48
has
even
considered
proceedings.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
we
would
say
that
the
states,
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
bill
to
which
i
will
come,
have
top
billing
as
it
were.
the
state's
systems
are
given
the
opportunity
to
act
first.
and
if
the
states
do
act,
we
think
that
the
federal
power
is
pro
tanto
excluded,
that
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
exactly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mccarran-ferguson
act,
i
think,
has
as
its
policy
that
each
state
may
regulate
for
itself
for
the
protection
of
its
own
citizens.
and
if
it
does,
that
is
all
the
regulation
that
there
is
to
be.
there
is
not
to
be
double
regulation
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
so
that
any
if
state
acts,
then
the
federal
trade
commission,
i
would
say,
cannot
enter
an
order
which
would
deal
with
the
practices
of
an
insurer
within
the
borders
of
that
state.
if
new
jersey
has
a
proceeding
and
says
that
national
can't
distribute
this
advertising
literature
in
new
jersey
and
then
the
federal
trade
commission
comes
in
and
files
a
complaint,
i
would
say
that
the
federal
trade
commission's
order
could
only
be
made
effective
in
relation
to
the
other
47
states.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
certainly
if
the
federal
trade
commission
has
not
at
that
point
proceeded,
it
would
not
proceed
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
perhaps
regulation
would
begin
with
the
institution
of
a
specific
complaint.
but
certainly,
i
would
say,
it
does
not
begin
with
the
mere
enactment
of
an
enabling
statute
giving
legislative
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
power
to
the
administrator
and
that's
our
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
maybe
one
would
have
a
substantive
due
process
question
there.
we,
of
course,
do
not
concede
that
anything
that
state
cannot
regulate
is
in
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
in
our
cases
here
now,
100%
of
the
material
in
the
american
case
and
95%
in
the
national
case
is
distributed
by
the
local
agents
after
they
get
it
from
the
home
office
and
certainly
as
to
those
portions,
the
--
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
states
could,
if
they
chose,
effectively
regulate.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
have
relation
to
regulation
by
each
of
the
states
in
which
the
material
was
disseminated.
i
think
certainly
each
state
has
the
power
and
the
legitimate
interest
to
prevent
dissemination
within
the
state
of
false
and
deceptive
material.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
perhaps
the
home
offices
--
perhaps
the
--
the
only
state
conceivably
would
be
the
state
of
the
corporation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
perhaps
they
might.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
answer
is
it
might.
i
think
most
of
the
state
statutes
in
terms
would
not
permit
that
because
most
of
the
state
statutes
deal
with
misrepresentations
occurring
within
the
state
and
i
take
it
that
this
representation
to
the
public
occurs
at
the
place
of
dissemination
rather
than
at
the
place
where
the
home
office
is
sending
material
out
to
its
own
agents.
so
--
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
does.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
does
and
i
--
i
wish
to
get
to
it
immediately.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
if
the
state
officer,
let
us
say
the
commissioner
of
insurance
made
a
determination
or
a
ruling,
be
it
formal
or
informal,
that
--
that
only
certain
of
these
representations
were
serious
not
in
his
view
that
he
was
going
to
proceed
against
it
or
if
he
determines
that
some
were
permissible
and
others
might
not
be,
i
don't
think
that
we
could
then
regulate.
i
think
his
determination
would
be
dispositive
as
to
the
protection
of
the
citizens
of
that
state
are
going
to
get.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
not
concede
that
was
so.
if
the
federal
trade
commission
already
had
an
outstanding
order
because
i
would
think
that
once
jurisdiction
attached
to
issue
the
federal
trade
commission
order
that
it
would
not
thereafter
be
absolute.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
new
york
had
determined
before
there
was
any
outstanding
federal
injunction
for
itself,
which
representations
were
good
and
which
were
bad,
then
i
would
say
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
so
far
as
the
federal
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
states
could
always
proceed
for
themselves
but
i
don't
--
what
--
my
suggestion
was
that
the
federal
cease-and-desist
order,
if
it
had
been
entered
before
there
were
any
state
proceeding,
would
not
be
vacated
merely
because
the
state
thereafter
brought
a
proceeding.
now,
the
state
could
still
go
in
its
own
proceeding.
let
me
illustrate.suppose
the
federal
trade
commission
finds
that
the
representations
are
not
deceptive,
all
of
the
48
states
could
each
consider
for
itself,
each
for
itself,
whether
it
wanted
to
prohibit
some
of
the
representation
or
if
the
federal
trade
commission
concludes
that
the
advertising
is
defective.
it
might
well
be
that
the
state
commissioners
of
the
insurance
would
still
want
to
obtain
a
state
cease-and-desist
order
against
the
same
practices,
so
they
could
police
it
and
go
into
the
state
court.
our
question
here
is
not
whether
the
states
may
act,
but
they
can
in
all
events.
the
question
is
when
the
federal
government
is
disabled
from
acting.
now,
i
--
i
think
it
is
the
statutory
question
basically.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
and
even
if
they
are
later,
they
can
supplement.
they
can
also
come
in
and
have
their
own
orders
and
make
their
own
determination.
now,
i
need
hardly
spend
any
time
on
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
instead
it's
so
familiar
to
the
court.
we
have
set
it
forth
on
page
3.
i
do
point
out
that
it
is
with
the
federal
trade
commission
act
that
we
begin
and
not
with
mccarran-ferguson
because
the
ftc
act
is
the
organic
act
which
confers
upon
it,
upon
the
commission
its
jurisdiction.
and
the
courts
below,
i
think,
erroneously
proceeded
from
the
premise
that
they
were
to
look
in
mccarran-ferguson
to
find
commission
jurisdiction.
section
5,
which
relates
to
unfair
and
deceptive
acts
and
practices,
is
set
out
in
full
at
page
3.
let
me
note
only
in
passing
that
the
ftc
act
made
no
exception
for
the
business
of
insurance,
though
it
did
for
some
other
businesses
like
banking
and
common
carriage.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
4
and
5.
the
statement
of
purpose
at
the
outset,
at
the
top
of
page
4,
is
that
continued
regulation
and
taxation
by
the
several
states
of
the
business
of
insurance
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
silence
on
the
part
of
congress
shall
not
impose
any
barrier
to
the
regulation
or
taxation
by
the
state.
then,
in
section
2,
consistently
with
that
general
declaration
of
purpose,
we
find
that
2
(a)
provides
that
the
business
of
insurance
shall
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
several
states,
which
relate
to
the
regulation
or
taxation
of
such
business.
and
(b)
goes
on
to
say
that
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair
or
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
and
then,
we
come
to
the
proviso
clause
which
is
the
crucial
sentence
for
these
cases,
"provided
that
after
june
30,
1948,
the
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act
and
the
federal
trade
commission
act
shall
be
applicable
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
extent
that
such
business
is
not
regulated
by
state
laws.
now,
narrowly,
i
think
our
question
here
is
what
do
the
four
words
regulated
by
state
law
mean
as
used
in
the
statute?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
position,
that
the
mere
enactment
of
state
enabling
statutes,
which
set
out
general
standards,
impose
no
sanctions,
delegate
all
authority
to
regulate
to
an
administrative
agency.
that
the
mere
enactment
of
such
statute
is
not
--
isn't
position
that
respondents
take
which
leads
them
in
this
case
to
argue
that
even
though
there
has
been
no
regulation
in
fact,
no
consideration
by
the
states
of
the
practices
which
are
challenged
in
these
cases.
even
so,
they
would
say
in
their
sentence,
there
has
been
regulation
because
there
is
a
law
on
the
books
under
which
the
commissioner
of
insurance,
if
he
knew
about
this
or
learned
about
it
and
if
he
chose
to
proceed
and
to
conduct
a
hearing,
could
or
might
enter
at
all.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
several
states
in
which
there
is
no
statute.
i've
been
addressing
myself
to
the
situation
which
takes
in
more
than
40
of
the
states
where
there
is
a
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
national
does
business
in
48
states.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you're
looking
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
at
the
national
record
at
202?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you're
looking
at
the
examiner's
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
as
i
was
saying
i
--
i
think
our
--
our
question
is,
what
regulation
by
a
state
law
means
as
used
in
this
act?
now,
one
will
note
that
the
sentence
immediately
precedingly
proviso
speaks
about
any
law
enacted
by
any
state.
however,
the
proviso
declares
that
there
shall
be
federal
jurisdiction
to
the
extent
that
such
business
is
not
regulated
by
state
laws.
now,
i
--
i
suggest
that
if
congress
had
proposed
to
do
so,
it
would
have
been
a
very
easy
matter
to
make
the
incidence
of
federal
power
depend
upon
the
enactment
of
state
law.
indeed,
in
the
very
paragraph,
we're
here
concerned
with.
congress
speaks
of
an
act
--
enactments
under
state
law.
yet,
the
statute
does
not
provide
that
the
existence
of
state
legislation
or
the
enactment
of
state
law
will
automatically
exclude
the
federal
trade
commission
from
regulating
interstate
transactions
terminating
in
that
state.
on
the
contrary,
the
exception
is
phrased
in
terms
of
regulation
and
we
say
that
regulation
and
legislation
are
not
unanimous.
it
is
also
relevant
i
think
that
many
federal
acts
and
many
assertions
of
federal
power
are
made
by
congress
to
depend
specifically
on
whether
there
is
a
state
law.
here,
we
have
a
--
a
different
choice
of
language,
not
the
word
"legislation"
or
not
enactment
of
state
laws,
but
the
use
of
the
word
"regulation".
now,
i
don't
suggest
that
one
should
consider
this
simply
as
a
--
as
a
dictionary
proposition,
certainly
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
purposes
and
such
light
--
to
consider
such
light
as
maybe
cast
catch
by
the
history
of
mccarran-ferguson.
now,
as
the
court
is
--
i'm
sure
aware,
mccarran-ferguson
was
a
direct
response
by
the
congress
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1944
in
united
states
against
south-eastern
underwriters.
that
decision
in
a
sherman
act
case
determined
for
the
first
time
for
overruling
precedents
going
back
for
so
many
years
that
the
business
of
insurance
was
commerce
in
the
sense
of
the
commerce
clause.
consequently,
the
court
reinstated
a
sherman
act
indictment
against
a
group
of
insurance
underwriters.
immediately,
following
that
opinion,
the
states
and
the
insurance
companies
made
very
strong
representations
to
the
congress,
asserting
that
if
the
commerce
clause
restrictions
apply
to
the
states,
to
their
regulatory
measures
and
to
their
taxing
statutes,
that
many
of
the
existing
state
systems,
established
state
systems
with
the
effect
it
was
claimed
that
there
was
great
confusion
and
doubt,
and
that
it
couldn't
be
set
what
state
laws
would
be
held
to
be
burdened
upon
commerce
or
to
be
discriminatory
against
commerce
and
--
and
what
--
what
is
not.
now,
it
was
against
this
background
that
congress
passed
mccarran-ferguson.
there's
no
question
that
congress
meant
to
permit
the
state
systems
to
operate
as
they
had
prior
to
the
south-eastern
underwriters
decision.
we
don't,
for
a
moment,
challenge
that.
what
we
do
say
is
that
mccarran-ferguson
did
not
intend
to
leave
any
no
man's
land,
any
vacuum
in
which
there
would
be
no
regulation.
it
wanted
to
provide
for
situations
in
which
the
states
could
not
act,
perhaps
for
constitutional
reasons
that
applied
to
particular
facts.
and
it
wanted
to
provide
for
regulation,
we
believe,
in
situations
in
which
the
states,
though
they
might
act
did
not
choose
to
act
or
fail
to
act.
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
few
minutes
to
such
history
as
we
have
which
bears
on
the
meaning
of
this
proviso
clause.
there
were
separate
bills
introduced
in
each
of
the
two
houses
in
1945,
following
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case.
the
bills
in
each
house
would
have
provided
in
one
way
or
another
that
the
states
would
continue
to
regulate
what
they
had
in
the
past,
the
insurance
business.
the
house
report
and
also
senator
mccarran
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
both
pointed
out
that
there
were
limitations
upon
what
the
states
could
do
in
relation
to
out-of-state
companies,
due
process
limitations.
and
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
go
on
to
state
that
the
respective
bills
are
designed
to
ensure
adequate
and
effective
regulation.
now,
mccarran-ferguson
states
to
be
sure
that
the
federal
government
shall
not
impair
the
state
systems.and
the
proviso
clause
declares
to
be
sure
that
if
the
states
act,
the
federal
government
will
not
act.
we
suggest
that
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
the
federal
government
shall
not
impose
either
conflicting
or
double
regulation.
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
the
federal
government
is
precluded
from
acting
where
the
states
are
not
providing
any
regulation.
now,
what
light
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
all
state
regulation
would
have
to
be
by
or
pursuant
to
state
law.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
between
is
a
piece
of
legislation
which
delegates
authority
to
an
administrative
agency.
the
legislation
itself
and
the
regulation,
which
i
think
is
only
completed
under
a
statute
of
this
kind
when
the
administrative
machinery
is
used.
what
i
have
in
mind,
i
think,
is
what
was
very
colorfully
stated
by
the
late
justice
jackson
in
the
ruberoid
case.
there,
he
was
not
talking
about
the
federal
trade
commission
act
but
about
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
in
speaking
of
robinson-patman,
he
considered
the
administrative
process.
he
first
pointed
out
that
robinson-patman
sets
up
general
standards.
and
then,
he
went
on
to
say,
“such
legislation,”
i'm
looking
at
page
53
of
the
government's
brief,
“represents
in
inchoate
law,
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
lay
down
rules
which
call
for
immediate
compliance
on
paying
of
punishment
by
judicial
process.
the
intervention
of
another
authority
must
mature
and
perfect
an
effective
rule
of
conduct
before
one
is
subject
to
coercion.”
and
then,
he
goes
on
to
develop
the
--
the
points
that
under
a
statute
like
this,
there
is
an
expanded
legislative
power
which
goes
to
the
administrative
agency."
and
only
when
the
general
standards
of
the
statute
are
given
meaning
and
content
in
the
specific
case,
only
when
a
rule
or
order
is
issued,”
he
says,
“does
one
have
regulation,"
and
that
is
the
argument
we
are
making
here.
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
sense
in
which
one
should
read
regulated
by
state
law
in
this
statute.
if
one
is
to
avoid
the
situation
where
there
will
be
a
regulatory
void,
the
experience
has
been,
as
perhaps
might
have
been
anticipated,
perhaps
because
of
the
difficulties
of
the
states
in
dealing
with
this
situation,
the
experience
in
any
event
has
been
that
the
states
has
not
been
acting
in
this
field.
now,
we
think
that
mccarran-ferguson
made
clear
that
the
states
could
act.
it
made
clear
moreover
that
they
might
act
if
they
chose
free
of
commerce
clause
restrictions.
but
we
don't
think
that
federal
regulation
in
the
sense
that
i'm
speaking
about,
regulation
by
the
institution
of
administrative
proceedings
and
the
issuance
of
administrative
orders
that
such
federal
regulation
is
precluded
unless
there
is
at
least
some
consideration,
some
ruling,
some
determination
by
the
state.
now,
i
don't
say
that
the
state
has
to
decide
that
it
will
file
a
cease-and-desist
proceeding.
i
think
the
state
might
rule
through
its
commissioner
or
other
officer
that
certain
practices
from
the
standpoint
of
that
state
are
all
right.
and
if
it
does
that,
we
concede
that
that
is
a
ruling
or
determination,
that
is
regulation
which
would
prevent
a
federal
order
from
being
applied
to
the
insurance
company
doing
business
in
that
state.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
don't
say
there
has
to
be
a
formal
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
some
--
something
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
that
they
had
made
a
ruling.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
so,
if
it's
--
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no,
the
--
if
the
federal
trade
commission
institutes
a
proceeding
against
national
as
it
did
here
and
national
can
come
in
and
show
any
ruling
or
can
produce
an
affidavit,
the
state
has
acted
in
the
matter.
i
think
that's
perfectly
sufficient
to
establish
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
in
relation
to
that
state.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i--
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
either
the
federal
trade
commission,
your
honor,
or
the
federal
courts
are
to
make
at
any
stage
a
qualitative
judgment
as
to
whether
the
state
commissioners
are
doing
a
good
job.
if
they
rule
upon
it,
their
determination
whether
it
may
be
wise
or
unwise
in
somebody
else's
opinion
is
the
determination
which
is
effective,
so
far
as
the
citizens
of
that
state
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
is
--
are
concerned.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it
--
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
it
might
be
necessary
to
secure
an
affidavit
from
him
in
that
--
in
that
circumstance.
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
the
--
the
facts
as
to
whether
there
has
been
any
ruling
involved
in
this
national
case.
now,
this
was
placed
in
issue
originally.
national
filed
an
answer
which
appears
at
11
and
12
of
the
national
record
in
which
it
made
a
claim
that
under
michigan
law,
it
was
fully
regulated.
the
examiner
made
a
finding
in
relation
to
that
claim.
national
doesn't
claim
that
anybody
--
any
officer
of
any
of
the
other
47
states
regulated
to
this
claim
that
was
regulated
by
michigan.
the
examiner's
finding
on
that
is
at
record
190
and
he
states,
“respondent's
officials
have
nothing
to
show
approval
of
respondent's
advertising
by
the
michigan
insurance
commissioner."
in
any
event,
it
was
never
submitted
to
him
for
approval.
respondent
does
not
submitted
the
advertising
to
the
insurance
commissioner
of
michigan
before
it
is
used.
respondent's
business
was
not
inspected
by
the
insurance
commissioner
of
the
state
during
the
period
covered
by
the
complaint
which
was
1953
and
1954.
that
finding
has
not
been
challenged
and
when
--
national
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
what
it
alleged
in
its
petition
for
review.
if
he
got
any
claim
that
it
was
regulated
by
michigan
and
it
alleges
on
record
214,
45
states
including
the
state
of
michigan
have
an
active
statutes.
that's
the
basis
for
their
claim
that
they
are
regulated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
i
--
i
would
make
--
wish
to
make
clear
that
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
must
be
anything
like
a
formal
ruling.
we
do
say
that
there
is
an
obligation
upon
the
party
who
claims
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
been
divested
to
show
something
in
the
nature
of
regulation
beyond
the
mere
enactment
of
a
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
has
--
there
has
been
very
little
litigation
on
--
insofar
as
the
sherman
act
is
concerned
because
most
of
the
states,
it
may
be
almost
all
of
them,
have
permitted
insurance
companies
to
engage
in
price
fixing
through
rate
bureaus.
there's
a
contrary
policy
and
we
would
not
assert
that
if
there
is
a
contrary
state
policy,
there
was
any
room
at
all
under
mccarran-ferguson
for
federal
action,
safe
to
the
extent
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
itself
explicitly
provides
in
section
4
that
the
sherman
act
may
still
be
invoked
regardless
of
state
legislation
where
there's
coercion,
boycott
or
intimidation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it
will
depend
on
what
the
state
legislation
was,
of
course,
whether
the
states
had
policies.
now,
in
fact,
i
think
state
policy
--
state
policies
are
not
consonant
with
the
sherman
act,
so
that
leaves
very
little
room.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
leaves
little
room.
certainly,
the
sherman
act
is
not
eliminated
altogether
and
section
4
itself
shows.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it's
narrow,
but
i
--
i
--
we
have
not
cataloged
the
--
the
state
sherman
acts.
we've
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
been
interested
in
state
federal
trade
commission
acts.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
don't
think
this
--
my
impression
at
least
is
that
the
states
do
not
have
on
so
greatest
--
that
so
--
not
so
many
of
the
states
have
statutes
comparable
to
the
clayton
act.
it
does
have
states
which
deal
with
the
matter
of
rate
fixing.
i
think
most
of
the
states
have
given
license
to
the
insurance
companies
to
get
together
through
joint
action
and
fixed
rates
through
their
rate
bureaus
and
the
like.
there
have
been
no
federal
antitrust
cases,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
involving
the
insurance
business,
saved
in
situations
where
there
has
been
allegations
of
boycott,
coercion
or
intimidation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
co-counsel
mentions
the
new
orleans
insurance
case.
now,
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes
to
go
beyond
the
--
the
reports
and
make
brief
reference
to
some
of
the
history
as
made
by
those
who
are
in
charge
of
the
legislation.
this
proviso
clause
that
we're
concerned
with
was
added
in
conference.
the
conference
report
doesn't
discuss
it,
so
we
are
thrown
back
upon
the
statements
of
the
sponsors.
now,
as
it
happens,
all
three
of
the
senate
conferees
did
address
themselves
to
the
proviso
clause
during
the
debates
in
the
senate.
and
we
have
excerpts
from
each
of
those
three
conferee
statements
at
page
58
and
the
following
pages.
senator
mccarran's
statement
appears
at
58.
we've
quoted
it
there
and
he
points
out,
“if
the
states
enact
legislation,”
i'm
reading
from
the
second
sentence
of
that
quotation,
“to
the
extent
that
they
regulate,
they
would
have
taken
the
business
of
insurance
out
from
under
the
sherman
and
the
clayton
and
the
other
acts
to
the
extent
that
they
regulate
our
--
our
words
which
we
emphasize
and
that
they
again
suggest
that
this
use
of
regulate
rather
than
legislate,
regulate
rather
than
enact
laws
in
the
proviso
clause
is
not
accidental
but
apparently
purposeful.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lang,
in
dealing
with
the
legislative
history,
referred
the
court
to
a
passage
taken
from
senator
mccarran's
comments
when
he
was
dealing
specifically
with
the
2
(b)
proviso.
and
he
quoted
that
passage
from
page
30
of
the
brief
for
the
life
insurance
association.
and
he
read
a
question
which
began
on
29
from
senator
pepper,
"does
that
mean
after
january
1,
1948,
the
states
may
determine
whether
or
not
the
sherman
and
the
other
acts
become
applicable?"
and
he
also
read
the
first
sentence
of
the
reply,
namely,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
from
that,
he
draws
the
inference
that
notwithstanding
the
use
of
the
word
“regulated”
in
the
proviso,
the
court
should
treat
the
language
of
the
proviso
as
if
congress
has
--
had
said
if
the
states
enact
a
law.
however,
i
suggest
one
should
also
read
the
second
sentence
of
senator
mccarran's
reply
to
that
question,
and
that
reads.
“during
the
three-year
moratorium,
the
states
may
if
they
see
fit
to
do
so,
enact
legislation
for
the
purpose
of
regulation.”
and
then
he
says,
i
think
making
the
thought
still
more
clear,
“if
they
do
enact
such
legislation
to
the
extent
that
they
regulate,
they
will
have
taken
the
business
of
insurance
out
from
under
the
federal
acts.”
now,
i
find
it
difficult
to
read
that
passage
to
support
the
conclusion
that
legislation
in
the
form
of
a
general
enabling
statute
is
equivalent
to
regulation.
i
think
it
leads
to
an
opposite
inference.
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
certainly
think
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
it
doesn't
specifically,
but
i
would
assume
that
the
federal
control
over
the
mail
says
--
have
sifted
in
the
sylvanus
case
which
we
did
cite
in
our
brief.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
decided
that
question,
it
was
the
seventh
circuit
case.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
however,
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
held
the
criminal
statute
apply.
now,
of
course,
that's
no
substitute
for
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
that's
a
criminal
statute
and
it
involves
fraud,
much
advertising
maybe
misleading
or
deceptive
and
not
involve
fraud,
do
not
involve
the
kind
of
intent
that
one
would
have
to
prove
in
a
criminal
case.
moreover,
in
a
criminal
case,
we
have
the
burden
of
ruling
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
so
forth.
we
feel
that
the
federal
trade
commission
act
is
needed
because
it's
a
prophylactic
act
and
the
criminal
statutes
furnish
no
substitute.
now,
the
mail-order
problem
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
court,
i
think
properly
may
have
some
concern
with
that
because
of
its
close
relationship
and
it
is
in
our
view,
a
serious
question.
and
the
problem
arises,
i
think
typically,
where
an
insurance
company
incorporates
in
a
single
state,
say
the
state
in
nebraska.
it
doesn't
get
a
license
in
any
other
state
but
it
sends
out
its
advertising
materials
by
mail.
and
those
who
decide,
they
wish
to
buy
a
policy,
fill
out
a
form
and
send
it
back.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
other
47
states
are
probably
powerless
to
deal
with
that
situation.
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
any
enforcement
if
the
state
--
if
the
other
states
did
enter
a
cease
and
desist
order
against
sending
the
mails
into
the
states
how
they
could
possibly
enforce
it.
and
indeed,
in
the
travelers
health
case,
the
court
had
its
doubts
about
the
problem
of
enforcement,
at
least
where
it
extended
beyond
the
question
of
service
of
process.
and
justice
douglas's
concurring
opinion
observed
that
in
the
case
of
a
truly
mail-order
operation,
the
states
are
utterly
helpless.
now,
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right
and
that
was
a
very
special
provision
which
was
designed
by
congress
to
permit
a
reorientation
of
the
whole
picture
and
to
give
the
insurance
companies
as
congress
said,
a
breathing
spell.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
there's
no
question
that
congress
proposed
that
there
be
jurisdiction
where
the
states
could
not
act.
that
is
very
emphatically
brought
out
in
passages
which
are
at
pages
1661
of
our
brief
from
senators
ferguson
and
o'malley.
our
further
question,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
there
is
no
regulation
--
excuse
me.whether
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction,
where
the
states
could
concededly
regulate
under
statutes
already
on
the
books
of
the
states,
but
have
failed
to
do
so.
now,
a
word
about
this
matter
of
failure
to
regulate.
we
have
a
brief
by
the
state
of
michigan
signed
by
25
other
states.
i'm
not
going
to
deal
with
the
points
that
that
brief
makes
because
i
think
that
the
entire
brief
misconceives
the
extent
of
the
jurisdiction
which
we
are
claiming
and
that
the
opposition
is
based
upon
a
misconception.
but
what
does
that
briefs
state,
as
to
what
the
states
are
or
are
not
doing
by
way
of
regulation?
here
is
a
brief
signed
by
the
attorney
generals
of
26
states,
which
does
not
cite
a
single
specific
ruling
or
determination
as
to
the
advertising
practices
of
a
single
insurer,
which
does
not
refer
to
the
institution
of
a
single
cease
and
desist
proceeding
and
is
unable
to
refer
to
a
single
case,
having
arisen
in
the
state
courts.
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
we
are
in
opposition
to
the
states.
i
think
the
commission
would
welcome,
they
are
taking
on
this
job.
the
commission
does
not
wish
to
monopolize
the
policing
of
this
advertising
but
it
is
the
commission's
feeling
that
the
states
have
not
in
fact
been
regulated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
they
interpret
mccarran.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
that
i'm
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
quite
saying
that
there
is
that
conflict
of
views
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
so.
they
joined
issue
with
us
on
that
and
my
only
point
was
that
in
their
very
full
discussion
of
what
they
conceive
to
be
all
of
the
problems
including
the
practical
problems,
they
do
no
point
to
a
single
instance
in
which
one
of
the
states,
and
yet
may
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
--
they
deal
with
the
problems
of
regulation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
my
feeling,
if
i
may
say
so
in
further
answer
to
the
question,
is
that
probably
the
reasons
that
the
states
had
not
dealt
with
this
is
because
of
the
proportions
of
--
that
the
problem
has
assumed
especially
in
the
light
of
the
mail-order
business.
nationally,
it
does
business
in
48
states.
most
of
these
states
--
most
of
these
companies
likewise
are
multi-state
operations.
if
the
states
were
attempt
--
to
attempt
to
deal
with
the
practices
of
the
41
companies,
respondents
in
the
federal
trade
commission's
pending
cases,
they
would
have
to
bring
over
1000
proceedings,
assuming
that
that
they
could
deal,
which
we
seriously
doubt,
with
many
of
the
companies
whose
operations
are
mail-order
operations.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
you
understand
that
correctly,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
my
answer
would
be
that
it
would
not
necessary
lead
you
to
the
same
conclusion,
your
honor.
