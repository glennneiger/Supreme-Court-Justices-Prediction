chief

may
i
interrupt
with
just
one
more
question,
mr.
spritzer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
outset,
you
--
you
enumerated
five
different
types
of
misrepresentation.
i
think
it
was
in
the
case
of
national.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let
us
suppose
that
state
a
selects
one
of
those
types
of
misrepresentation
and
proceeds
against
national
for
that
one
and
only
that
one
type
of
misrepresentation,
what
is
the
position
of
the
federal
government
then
as
to
the
others?
could
it
--
could
it
then
proceed
against
the
company
on
the
others?
chief
justice

warren
we'll
recess
now.

chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
states
did
you
say
have
the
model
act
in
percent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
about
those
that
do
not
have
the
model
act?
are
they
--
do
they
adequate
people
blind
for
this
kind
of
activity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
every
state
of
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
--
suppose
it's
not
in
business
in
virginia,
but
it
is
in
oregon
i
should
say,
and
the
mail
comes
out
of
virginia.
who
would
--
who
would
prevent
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
not
be
in
the
insurance
business
and
i
suppose
it
wasn't
in
the
insurance
business,
selling
--
selling
insurance
in
virgina.
the
--
the
insurance
laws
of
virgina
would
not
apply.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
--
suppose
that
there
was
false
advertising
and
the
federal
government
was
taking
commerce
etcetera.
suppose
the
--
the
false
advertising
was
by
television
in
one
state
where
they
were
not
doing
any
business
and
it
was
going
all
over
the
country.
how
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
federal
government
in
those
states
where
it
was
not
added
with
the
control
they
regulate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
would
go
--
but
--
but
your
rule
would
prevent
the
--
the
government
in
doing
the
same
thing,
i
would
suggest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
there
are
companies
who
do
not
do
business
in
every
state
in
the
union,
and
suppose
they
--
suppose
they
did
adduce
on
television
in
a
state
of
the
union
where
they
were
not
doing
business
and
did
went
to
the
--
to
the
states
where
they
were
doing
business.
who
would
--
who
would
have
the
regulatory
power
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
state
where
the
broadcast
originated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
where
the
--
that's
where
the
broadcasting
has
originated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
had
in
mind
was,
the
broadcast
originates
in
a
state
in
which
a
company
is
not
doing
business,
but
it
goes
to
states
in
which
it
is
doing
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
who
could
stop
the
--
who
--
who,
under
the
state
laws
would
regulate
that
if
the
state
to
the
broadcasting
system
or
the
state
of
the
--
where
the
insurance
business
is
on.

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
wasn't
--
what
accidents
were
covered
in
your
policy,
mr.
wheeler?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
point
--
what
point
did
the
government
raise
on
that,
that
it
did
not
cover
this
other
ones
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wheeler,
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed
against
you.
there
was
no
law
in
mississippi.
did
--
did
the
federal
trade
commission
have
jurisdiction
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
as
far
as
mississippi
was
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
question
about
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
they
wouldn't
act.
and
it
was
only
the
--
only
the
passage,
subsequent
passage
of
the
act
which
diverse
to
the
government
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
