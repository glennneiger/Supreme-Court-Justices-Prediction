mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
counsel
for
petitioner
on
yesterday
entered
into
the
merits
of
the
case,
which
seem
to
me
were
the
obvious
purpose
of
attempting
to
convince
this
court
that
my
client
was
a
bad
actor
and
that
my
client
had
progressed
through
misrepresentation
and
control.
before
getting
into
the
question
before
this
court
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
be
justified
in
very
briefly
replying
to
that
position
taken
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
when
the
hearing
was
had
in
our
case,
every
state
in
which
my
client
did
business,
except
the
state
of
mississippi
had
enacted
regulatory
law.
it
had
not
been
enacted
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
after
an
extensive
hearing,
the
hearing
examiner
held
that
in
all
states
except
mississippi,
the
federal
trade
commission
had
no
jurisdiction.
but
as
the
law
had
not
been
enacted,
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
it
had
jurisdiction
in
that
state.
and
he
then
went
very
extensively
into
the
charges
in
the
complaint,
and
i
wish
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
that.
i'll
just
take
one
instance
in
the
complaint
with
which
he
dealt
and
i'll
say
that
the
hearing
examiner
exonerated
my
client
completely
and
held
that
it
had
not
been
guilty
of
any
false,
fraudulent
or
deceptive
practices.
just
one
instance
of
the
complaint,
one
item
the
complaint
was
based
on
the
charge
that
in
our
advertising,
we
had
the
statement,
“covers
accidents”.
the
hearing
examiner
in
his
--
his
initial
decision
and
all
of
these
are
in
the
record.
the
hearing
examiner
pointed
out
the
fact
that
in
that
complaint
and
they
--
the
federal
trade
commission
took
the
position
that
that
was
a
representation,
that
all
accidents
were
covered.
the
hearing
examiner
pointed
out
the
fact
that
the
federal
trade
commission
in
filing
the
complaint
had
stopped
at
a
comma
in
a
sentence
and
that
the
statement
in
the
advertising
was
“covers
accident,
subject
to
policy
terms.”
and
in
the
same
advertising,
there
was
the
statement
in
12-point
boldface
type.
“benefits
are
subjects
to
the
terms
of
the
policy
issues.”
the
hearing
examiner
under
the
undisputed
evidence
stated
that
these
brochures
were
sent
only
to
agents
and
became
a
part
of
the
agent
sale
kit
and
were
only
used
in
personal
interviews
with
prospects.
and
he
took
the
position
that
in
that
personal
interview,
that
when
the
advertising
stated,
covered
--
covers
accidents
subject
to
policy
terms
that
the
prospect
would
naturally
think
of
two
things.
one
was
that
accident
insurance
always
had
some
exceptions
and
the
other
was,
when
the
flag
was
raised,
subject
to
policy
terms
that
the
prospect
would
inquire
as
to
what
were
the
exceptions
in
what
accidents
were
not
covered.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
the
--
the
accidents
as
the
--
as
the
--
in
the
usual
policy.
it
was
provided
that
the
accident
had
to
be
by
external
and
violent
means.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
had
to
be
external
and
violent
means
as
practically
all
policies
of
accidents
insurance
provide.
and
provided
that
if
the
accidental
death
was
brought
about
by
self-destruction
either
while
sane
or
insane,
that
was
not
covered,
just
the
--
the
normal
exceptions
in
an
accident
policy
and
those
were
the
terms
that
were
referred
to
when
it
said
subject
to
policy
terms.
now,
the
--
the
share
--
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
the
--
the
government
took
the
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
for
this
not
to
be
deceptive
advertising
that
it
was
necessary
for
every
limitation
of
the
policy
to
be
set
out
verbatim
in
all
of
the
advertising.
in
other
words,
all
of
the
exceptions
would
have
to
be
limited
and
that
the
place
in
their
subject
to
this
policy
terms
was
not
sufficient.
that
was
the
position
they
took.
now,
the
--
the
hearing
examiners,
this
appears
on
page
58
of
the
record.
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
charging
the
respondent
with
making
false
and
misleading
statements
and
representations
with
respect
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
its
policies
in
general
or
with
respect
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
specific
policies
have
not
been
established
by
a
substantial,
reliable
probative
evidence.
accordingly,
it
cannot
be
found
that
the
respondent
has
violated
the
federal
trade
commission
act
by
engaging
in
unfair
and
deceptive
acts
and
practices
in
commerce
to
the
prejudice
and
injury
of
the
public.
therefore,
it
is
ordered
that
the
complaint
herein
be
in
the
same,
is
hereby
dismissed.
on
appeal,
the
--
the
federal
trade
commission
held
that
the
charges
in
the
complaint
had
been
established
and
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order.
now
--
proceeding
now
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
counsel
for
petitioner
refers
to
these
enactments
by
the
states,
as
little
trade
commission
acts.
now,
of
course,
living
why
--
where
i
do,
it's
--
would
be
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
admit
that
anything
relative
to
texas
was
little.
but
without
being
at
all
facetious,
i
wish
to
submit
to
the
court
that
all
of
these
acts
are
solemn
enactments
by
the
state
legislators
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
dignity
as
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
counsel
takes
the
position
that
these
acts
are
permissive.
and
therefore,
the
insurance
commissioners
can
enforce
them
or
refrain
from
enforcing
them
just
as
he
desires.
all
of
these
insurance
commissioners
are
officers
of
the
state
under
oath
to
enforce
the
laws
that
are
in
their
charge.
and
i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
two
provisions
of
this
act,
one
of
which
is
attached
to
the
petitioner's
brief
and
one
to
our
brief.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
--
pages
34
and
41
of
our
brief,
the
appendix,
which
shows
clearly
that
these
acts
are
not
permissive
acts
but
they
are
mandatory
upon
the
officer
in
charge
with
the
duty.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
this
is
the
state
law.
yes,
sir.
on
page
34,
a
person
is
defined
as
any
individual,
corporation,
association,
partnership
reciprocally
exchanged
enter
insurer,
lodge
insurer,
fraternal
benefits
society
and
any
other
legal
entity
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
including
agents,
brokers
and
adjusters.
now,
changing
--
turning
to
page
41,
under
the
heading
“power
of
commissioner,”
the
commissioner
have
--
shall
have
power
to
examine
and
investigate
into
the
affairs
of
every
person
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance
in
this
state
in
order
to
determine
whether
such
person
has
been
or
is
engaged
in
any
unfair
method
of
competition
or
in
any
unfair
deceptive
act
or
practice
prohibited
by
section
3.
and
then,
in
the
next
paragraph,
this
shows
it
is
not
permissive.
whenever
the
commissioner
shall
have
reason
to
believe
that
any
person
has
been
engaged
or
is
engaging
in
this
state,
in
any
unfair
method
of
competition
or
any
unfair
or
deceptive
act
or
practice
defined
in
section
4,
and
that
a
proceeding
by
him
in
respect
thereto,
would
be
to
the
interest
of
the
public.
he
shall
issue
and
serve
upon
such
person
a
statement
of
the
charges
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
sir?
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
so
called,
not
by
all
of
them.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
i
believe,
mr.
lang
said
43
states.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
and
that
in
the
other
states,
there
were
similar
acts,
but
what
the
--
the
so-called
model
code
was
adopted
in
43
states.
i
think
therefore
that
the
charge
which
is
not
based
as
i
see
it
on
any
foundation
of
fact
whatsoever
that
these
state
commissioners
are
not
doing
anything
about
this
matter,
is
entirely
uncalled
for.
as
far
back
as
1944,
the
time
of
the
south
eastern
decision
which
of
course
was
before
these
model
acts
had
been
enacted
but
when
the
--
the
states
have
been
regulating
insurance
for
many
years,
mr.
justice
jackson
in
his
dissent
made
this
statement.
"the
states
began
nearly
a
century
ago
to
regulate
insurance.
and
state
regulation,
while
no
doubt
of
even
--
of
uneven
quality
is
a
successful
going
concern.
several
states
where
the
greatest
volume
of
insurance
is
transacted
have
rigorous
and
enlightened
legislation
with
enforcement
and
supervision
in
the
hands
of
experienced
and
competent
officials."
and
now,
that
these
so
called
model
acts
have
been
passed,
i
think
that
we
must
assume
that
these
sworn
officers
of
the
state
--
of
the
states
who
have
the
interest
of
the
citizens
of
their
state
at
heart
to
see
that
they
are
not
imposed
upon,
to
see
that
they
are
not
defrauded.
i
think
we
must
certainly
presume
that
they
will
be
as
diligent
and
as
conscientious
in
the
enforcement
of
their
laws
as
the
federal
trade
commission
is
in
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
law.
and
i
think
it's
uncalled
for
without
any
foundation
of
fact
to
say
that
these
laws
are
not
being
enforced.
while
i
think
the
position
that
it
doesn't
turn
on
the
enforcement
of
the
law,
the
power
to
the
states
is
given
by
the
enactment
of
the
law.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
no,
sir,
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
no.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
language
to
the
extent
that
such
business
is
not
regulated
by
state
law,
cannot
be
tortured
as
they
would
attempt
to
torture
it
to
mean
to
the
extent
that
an
adequate
state
regulatory
law
is
being
enforced
by
the
states.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
sir?
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
well,
i
think
i
--
i
think
i
could
leave
the
--
the
adequate
out.
i
think
when
we
read
--
when
we
read
these
model
acts,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
they
are
adequate.
now
then,
coming
to
the
--
coming
onto
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
i'm
sorry?
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
except
that
i
think
that
these
laws
where
it
states
and
i
will
apply
it
before
i
close,
i
will
apply
it
to
--
to
my
case.
that
in
our
case,
there
is
no
extent
to
which
the
law
is
not
regulated
by
the
--
our
acts
are
not
regulated
by
state
law.
now,
what
occurs
to
me
is,
if
--
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
i
don't
think
that's
necessary.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
no,
sir.
i
didn't
--
didn't
mean
to
say
it.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes.
now,
what
occurs
to
me
is,
if
the
government
is
right
in
this
matter,
who
would
determine
--
who
would
determine
as
to
whether
these
laws
were
being
enforced
or
not,
the
state
laws?
would
the
federal
trade
commission
determine
it?
we
have
a
case
in
which
an
insurance
company
does
business
in
43
states,
in
the
43
states
in
which
these
model
laws
have
been
passed.
now
then,
they
bring
a
complaint
against
this
company.
if
they
are
correct,
they
have
no
jurisdiction
where
the
law
is
being
enforced.
it
would
seem
to
me
therefore,
in
every
case,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
would
not
depend
on
the
state
of
the
law.
but
in
every
case,
if
they
are
correct,
would
depend
on
whether
the
law
was
being
enforced
in
each
one
of
these
states.
so,
in
each
case,
in
each
case
where
a
complaint
had
been
filed,
there
would
first
have
to
be
determined
the
question
of
--
of
jurisdiction
as
to
whether
the
law
was
being
enforced,
or
whether
the
law
was
not
being
enforced.
now,
what
quantum
--
what
quantum
of
enforcement
would
be
necessary
according
to
them
to
give
jurisdiction
and
how
--
how
would
that
be
determined?
and
then,
there's
the
followed
proposition.
it
seems
to
be
the
set
law
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
not
determined
by
whether
they
have
jurisdiction
at
the
time
the
complaint
is
filed.
but
as
in
our
case,
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
law
had
not
been
passed
by
mississippi.
before
the
hearing,
before
the
commission,
the
law
had
been
enacted
by
mississippi.
so,
in
all
of
the
states
in
which
we
did
business,
the
law
had
been
enacted.
now
then,
suppose
in
this
case,
after
they
had
determined
that
the
law
had
not
been
enforced
in
any
of
these
states
and
therefore,
they
had
jurisdiction.
supposed
during
the
pendency
of
that
case,
the
--
some
state
began
to
enforce
the
law.
so
then,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
would
have
to
be
determined
at
the
time
that
they
entered
the
order,
then
they
would
have
no
jurisdiction
of
the
state
that
had
began
to
enforce
the
law
after
the
--
after
the
hearing
had
proceeded.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
congress
could
not
have
had
any
such
idea
in
mind
and
--
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
i'm
inclined
to
believe
it
did
--
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
--
as
far
as
mississippi
was
concerned.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
that
--
that
is
our
position.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
now
then,
i
wish
to
refer
very
briefly,
i
haven't
seen
one
of
these
lights
come
on
yet.
i
--
i
may
have
missed
it.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
yes.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
born
out
by
the
--
the
report,
the
fact,
the
position
that
we
take
that
it
isn't
the
enactment
of
the
law.
i
think
that
is
born
out
by
the
report
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
at
the
time
that
the
moratorium
was
--
was
extended
for
six
months,
and
that
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
31.
now,
i
think
it's
quite
significant.
this
bill
--
this
is
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
the
judiciary
as
to
the
proposed
amendment
to
extend
the
moratorium,
six
months.
this
bill
extends
to
so-called
moratorium
--
mr.
j.
d.
wheeler
31
of
our
brief.
this
bill
extends
the
so-called
moratorium
provision
of
public
law
of
15
of
the
79th
legislature,
from
january
1,
1948
until
june
30th,
1948.
the
committee
is
informed
and
is
satisfied
that
an
effort
has
been
exerted
by
the
insurance
industry,
the
insurance
commissioners
and
the
states
in
dealing
with
the
matter
of
state
regulation.
however,
the
committee
recognizes
that
the
problems
have
not
been
solved
and
is
all
the
opinion
that
an
extension
of
the
so-called
moratorium
should
be
granted
in
order
to
provide
the
congress
an
additional
time
to
examine
into
the
situation
more
completely
than
it
has
been
able
to
do
during
the
present
session.
as
the
committee
is
of
the
opinion
that
considerable
studies
should
be
given
to
this
matter
and
the
question
of
the
need,
if
any,
of
further
federal
legislation.
it
would
appear
most
desirable
to
extend
this
moratorium
period
an
additional
six
months,
therefore,
giving
--
thereby,
giving
the
congress
a
reasonable
time
to
examine
the
developments
have
--
that
have
taken
place
in
this
field
during
and
immediately
subsequent
to
the
meetings
of
the
1947
legislatures.
now
then,
the
1947
legislatures
could
only
enact
regulatory
laws.
now,
i
point
out
that
nearly
10
years
has
passed
since
that
report
was
made
and
that
apparently,
the
state
regulation
is
satisfactory
to
the
congress
because
they
have
not
found
the
need
of
any
additional
federal
legislation.
of
course,
we
know
at
anytime,
and
we
take
the
position
that
this
proposition
of
adequacy
of
enforcement
is
not
in
the
province
of
the
federal
trade
commission
but
it
is
in
the
province
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
at
anytime
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
is
dissatisfied
with
the
way
the
state
laws
are
being
enforced.
they
can
set
up
adequate
federal
laws
and
set
up
adequate
federal
legislation
and
take
over
this
entire
proposition
of
the
regulation
of
insurance.
of
course,
this
proposition
of
advertising
is
a
very
small
segment
of
this
regulation.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
apparent
that
the
present
situation
over
a
period
of
10
years
since
the
committee
said
they
would
engage
in
that
study
has
been
satisfactory
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
which
is
the
body
to
pass
on
whether
this
job
is
being
done
or
not.
now,
in
our
case,
we
do
no
mail-order
business,
we
do
no
magazine
or
newspaper
advertising,
we
do
no
radio
or
television
advertising,
we
do
no
direct
mail
advertising
of
any
kind.
these
brochures
are
merely
sent
to
our
agents
in
their
sealed
kit
to
be
presented
in
face-to-face
interviews
with
the
prospects.
if
they
disseminate
any
advertising,
which
is
objectionable
in
every
state
where
we
do
business,
cease
and
desist
orders
may
be
issued
against
us.
heavy
fines
maybe
imposed
upon
us
because
the
law
provides
for
heavy
fines
and
the
license,
both
of
the
company
and
of
every
agent,
may
be
rescinded
by
the
state
authorities.
we
therefore
submit,
that
in
our
case,
there
is
no
extent
to
which
our
business
in
not
regulated
by
state
law.
thank
you.
