justice
felix
frankfurter
--
am
i
to
infer
therefore
that
you
are
not
suggesting,
or
neither
suggesting
the
topic.
you're
not
suggesting
that
if
you
prevail
that
the
federal
trade
commission
acts
apply,
then,
the
respective
state
law
is
dealing
the
same
subject
matter
and
then
go
to
sleep.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
preemption
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
were
both
whether
--
you
also
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
ask
one
more
explicit
matter?
could
any
state,
if
or
--
as
a
commissioner,
if
any
state
brought
proceedings
under
little
federal
trade
commission
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
the
very
abusive,
which
underlies
the
proceeding,
if
they
have
been
met,
if
the
state
proceeding
been
met
with
the
claim
that
it's
--
that
is
interstate
commerce
and
excluded
from
the
state
regulatory
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
practically,
but
could
--
could
the
state
proceedings
be
challenged
on
the
ground
that
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
see
what
the
transaction
was
sought
to
be,
let's
say,
for
houston
because
they
involved
interstate
transactions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
proceed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
this
very
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
by
that
48
states
or
what?
you
--
you
said
pro
tanto.
suppose
in
x
number
of
states,
proceedings
are
actually
begun
like
unto
the
immediate
proceedings
before
us,
and
then
suppose
x
number
is
three
or
five
or
27
or
48,
now,
what
is
the
effect
of
that
from
this
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
that
this
--
this
(inaudible)
meeting,
if
isn't
summed
up,
of
the
house
of
governors,
there's
an
agreement
among
the
48
governors
that
they
will
instruct
their
power
to
the
attorney
general
to
begin
those
proceedings
and
48
proceedings
start
or
initiated
in
the
48
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
displaces
all
the
federal
trade
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
asking
about
policy,
i'm
asking
about
the
limitation
of
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
made
that
--
you've
made
that
clear
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i'm
not
wholly
clearer
to
the
effects
of
the
actual
beginning
of
the
process
of
enforcing
state
laws.
and
i
gather
from
what
you
last
said,
if
assuming
there
is
no
sham
about
it,
48
states
get
going.
that's
the
plan
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
also
state
the
states
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
little
retrospective
interpretation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
must
be
some
avow
--
some
formal
manifestations,
some
pronouncement
that
will
advise
the
federal
trade
commission
which
the
insurance
commission
of
idaho
or
georgia
or
wyoming
or
mainly
on
the
job.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
would
he
know
if
it
was
not
a
formal?
there
must
be
some
public
evidence
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
insurance
commissioner
of
wyoming
had
made
around
the
job,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
that
he
--
that
he
is
a
(inaudible)
man
and
has
worried
about
it,
studied
it
and
decided
that
there's
nothing
to
proceed
again.
that
will
do.
he
must
make
that
manifest,
somehow
or
rather
that
the
reaches
the
federal
trade
commission
unconstitutionality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
what
the
judge
(inaudible)
could
--
could
you
say
that
likely
without
having
litigation,
whether
he
did
or
didn't
act,
whether
he
did
or
didn't
consider,
whether
he
has
sufficiently
considered
(inaudible)
from
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
which
you
have
lots
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
litigations,
lots
of
litigation
whether
he
did
rule
upon
as
i
(inaudible)
couldn't
determine
this
thing
unless
--
it
then
established
that
he
did
rule
(voice

--
justice
felix

--
beyond
having
satisfied
himself
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
trying
to
search
is
not
their
claim
but
your
claim
because
i
should
think
it's
the
common
experience
of
every
prosecutor
and
(inaudible)
but
the
fact
that
if
you
don't
prosecute
doesn't
mean
approval.
it
maybe
you
wait
for
a
rightful
change.
it
may
mean
this,
it
may
mean
that,
involving
discretion
in
determination
by
the
responsible
officials
to
act
on
the
law
or
not
without
thereby
giving
him
a
blue
ribbon
for
excellent
procurity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
a
mailing
in
california
or
virginia
just
outside
of
each
of
those
states
is
the
basis
for
this
call
of
a
license
in
those
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
excluded,
how
about
the
other
away
around,
the
mail
starting
in
state
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
draw
on
the
federal
courts
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
emphasize
that
this
--
the
federal
system.
i
should
think
it
maybe
sent
from
one
state
into
another
where
--
what
you're
saying
is,
what
i
get
out
of
you
is
--
mail
sense
falsely
disseminated
mail
sent
from
virginia
to
new
york,
there
to
get
business
in
new
york
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
commissioner
of
insurance,
superintended
of
insurance
in
new
york.
we
could
say
this
company
is
seeking
business
with
fraudulent
means
in
new
york
and
therefore,
will
stop
your
business
in
new
york.
why
do
you
have
to
bother
about
the
federal
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
--
if
a
company
doing
business
in
new
york,
the
superintendent
of
insurance
of
new
york,
he
goes
into
the
new
york
court
and
enforce
an
order
of
exclusion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
doing
business
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
in
new
york
to
everybody's
knowledge,
that
has
some
very
good
and
some
very
bad
simple
tense
of
the
insurance.
and
i
should
think
that
one
of
the
--
an
alert
superintendent
to
the
insurance
will
denounce
that
the
abc
company
is
engaged
in
fraudulent
representations.
it
could
have
a
serious
effect
on
the
people
in
new
york
who
will
pick
up
insurance
from
that
question,
the
lack
of
insurance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
states
--
all
i
get
from
your
observation
on
the
state
--
from
the
brief
of
the
states,
which
i
haven't
look
at,
is
that
they
joined
issue
with
you.
not
that
they
avoid
the
question
but
they
joined
issue
with
you,
to
where
you
say
the
mere
fact
of
their
statutes
on
the
books
is
not
--
is
not
regulation,
and
they
say
that
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
is
of
square
conflict
of
--
of
what
the
mccarran
act
means,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
--
occurs
to
me,
they
say
that
this
very
--
just
as
a
matter
of
statute
--
of
construction
by
this
court
to
regulate
in
the
constitution
means
sometimes
doing
nothing.
so,
to
regulate,
means
having
passed
the
statute
to
do
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
don't
think
that's
your
starting
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
correctly?
there's
no
mail-order
situation
before
us?
