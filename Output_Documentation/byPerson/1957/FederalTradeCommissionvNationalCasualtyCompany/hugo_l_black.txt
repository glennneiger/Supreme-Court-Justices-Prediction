are
you
reading
from
your
brief?

what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
in
the
state
where
the
advertising
was
disseminated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
mail
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you're
not.
i'm
--
i'm
just
finding
out
what
was
the
scope
of
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
realize
that
the
question
i'm
asking
you
is
not
--
i'm
going
to
ask
you
not
precisely
within
the
scope
of
your
case
here
(inaudible)
you
said
that
the
state
where
the
advertising
is
disseminated
and
the
mail-order
insurance
company
could
get
service
on
them.
how
could
it
enforce
its
order
not
to
do
business
there,
let's
say
only
do
it
through
mail
or
by
mail
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
held
that
they
could
sue
on
the
policy
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
mcgee
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
issued
an
order
that
a
mail
order
has
--
did
not
send
anymore
false
advertising
and
finding
it
was
false.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
they
could
--
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
state
could
go
into
the
federal
court
and
impose
it
for
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
he
enforce
his
order
against
mail
orders?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
about
that
in
connection
with
some
of
the
other
cases
you
have
cited.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
enforce
the
inclusion
against
the
mail-order
house?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
the
order
could
be
issued
as
against
--
as
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
be
enforced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
that
that
--
i
state
very
frankly,
i
don't
know
if
it
has
--
has
any
relevance
to
new
york
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
in
considering
the
old
broad
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
it
regulated
--
has
it
regulated
in
such
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
several
states
have
given
power
to
some
agencies
regulated
in
certain
ways,
have
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
in
effect
when
the
commerce
clause
would
give
congress
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce?
the
state
laws
which
give
these
agencies
a
power
to
regulate
except
to
that
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
basically
that
the
states
having
undertaken
to
regulate
to
this
extent,
that
we
should
construe
it
somewhat
as
we
have
in
certain
n.l.r.b.
cases
and
others
to
the
effect
that
the
state
having
indicated
its
desire
to
regulate
to
this
extent
as
negative
to
any
implication
that
it
desires
to
have
it
regulated
anymore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
that
--
it's
that
difference
if
you
are
right
in
saying
that
regulation
as
here,
means
any
legislation
which
the
state
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
certainly
doesn't
turn
of
it
on
our
belief,
the
reference
whether
the
state
is
doing
a
good
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
one
with
the
other
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
again,
do
you
have
to
depend
on
that
to
say
that
they
are
adequate?
maybe
their
acts
are
wholly
adequate,
insofar
as
laying
out
a
plan
of
future
regulation
is
concerned
but
does
that
mean
that
we
have
to
decide
that
they
are
either
wholly
adequate
or
not
wholly
adequate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
raises
something
i
didn't
know
was
here.
have
--
have
the
states
where
you
do
business,
provided
actual
machinery
--
not
merely
provided
machinery,
but
in
the
actual
effect,
releasing
the
type
of
advertising
that
your
company
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
thought
you
were
saying
ahead.
i
was
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
just
ask
a
question
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
belief
that
to
decide
this
case
against
them
--
if
it
should
be
decided
against
them,
in
connection
with
the
non-mail
order
houses,
would
necessarily
decide
that
the
same
with
the
ways
--
requires
to
decide
the
same
way
with
reference
to
mail-order
houses
or
do
you
draw
a
distinction?
