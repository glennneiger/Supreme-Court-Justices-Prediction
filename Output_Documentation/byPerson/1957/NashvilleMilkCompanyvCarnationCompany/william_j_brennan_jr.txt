one
of
these
quotations
from
the
record
particularly
the
statement
that
mr.
miller
after
that
had
all
been
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
when
mr.
celler
answered
that
question,
this
was
following
the
law
that
you've
given
us
as
i
understand
it.
it's
possible
of
course
for
a
man
to
violate
section
3
and
by
the
same
act
be
guilty
of
violation
of
the
other
sections
of
the
bill.
that
would
be
entirely
possible.
mr.
celler:
he
would
be
subject
to
triple
damages
as
well
as
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
miller:
that
would
be
entirely
possible.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
is
section
3,
a
violation
of
which
would
not
also
be
a
violation
of
amended
section
2?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
what
acts
would
be
a
violation
of
section
3
that
would
not
also
be
a
violation
of
amended
section
2?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
position
is
that
in
that
instance
the
criminal
penalty
only
would
apply?
