mr.
melville
c.
williams
may
it
please
the
court.
nashville's
entire
case
is
based
upon
the
contention
to
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
as
an
implied
amendment
of
the
clayton
act.
it
does
not
claim
that
it
was
an
express
amendment
that
it
became
part
of
the
clayton
act.
it
relies
solely
by
implication.
now,
at
the
outset,
nashville
is
met
with
the
burden
of
overcoming
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
of
the
presumption
against
implied
amendment.
our
first
position
is
that
it
has
not
overcome
this
presumption.
in
order
to
do
that,
it
must
show
more
than
there
is
a
mere
possibility
that
congress
might
have
thought
or
indented
that
section
3
will
become
part
of
the
clayton
act.
it
must
show
that
was
a
necessary
intent
of
congress.
now,
let's
examine
three
aspects
of
nashville's
contention.
first
is
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
amendment
of
the
clayton
act
at
all.
secondly,
assuming
arguendo
there
is
an
implied
amendment
of
the
clayton
act
is
that
the
kind
of
amendment
that
becomes
a
part
of
the
clayton
act
and
does
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
defined
in
section
1
of
the
clayton
act.
and
then
thirdly,
what
do
we
find
in
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
intent
of
congress
as
to
whether
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
was
or
was
not
to
become
part
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
as
to
the
first
point,
a
definition
of
an
amendment
of
an
act
is
set
forth
in
nashville's
brief.
it's
one
sentence
that
appears
on
pages
17
and
18.
it
states
that
a
law
is
amended
when
it
is
permitted
to
remain
and
something
is
added
or
taken
from
it
or
it
is
in
some
way
altered
to
better
accomplish
its
purpose.
in
this
case,
the
clayton
act
was
allowed
to
remain
insofar
as
section
3
is
concerned.
section
3
certainly
takes
nothing
from
the
clayton
act
and
it
does
not
alter
the
clayton
act
in
anyway.
the
question
then
is
whether
it
adds
something
to
it.
we
submit
that
nashville
has
confused
the
addition
of
something
to
the
antitrust
laws
with
the
addition
of
something
to
the
clayton
act.
section
3
adds
something
to
the
antitrust
laws
but
adds
nothing
to
the
clayton
act.
if
section
3
has
been
written
to
say,
an
act
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act
shall
be
subject
to
criminal
penalties
then
in
that
case
the
section
would
have
added
something
to
the
clayton
act
but
it
did
not
do
that.
it
set
up
its
own
separate
standards
of
what
constitutes
prohibited
acts.
so
our
position
is
that
this
section
3
stands
as
a
separate
piece
of
legislation.
this
is
illustrated
by
a
consideration
of
what
would
--
what
effect
a
repeal
of
section
3
would
have
on
the
clayton
act.
if
were
repealed
as
the
clayton
act
would
be
completely
ineffective,
it
would
stand
just
as
it
is.
similarly,
you
could
repeal
the
clayton
act
in
section
3
which
stands
completely
in
its
own
feet.
it
sets
forth
its
own
standards
of
conduct.
it
sets
forth
its
own
penalty.
so
we
submit
that
section
3
is
not
an
amendment
of
the
clayton
act.
next
quest
--
and
it's
no
more
in
amendment
for
example
than
other
laws.
the
antidumping
provisions
of
the
revenue
act
of
1916
prohibited
persons
from
bringing
--
importing
articles
into
the
united
states
and
selling
them
at
substantially
less
than
or
actual
value
with
the
intent
to
injure
industry
and
the
united
states.
under
the
theory
advanced
here
if
section
3
is
an
amendment
of
the
clayton
act,
similarly
this
antidumping
provision
of
the
act
of
19
--
revenue
act
of
1916
is
an
amendment
of
the
sherman
act
and
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
referred
to
in
section
1
of
the
clayton
act.
the
tariff
act
from
1930
prohibited
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
no,
your
honor
not
if
it
just
said
amendatory.
now,
the
next
--
that's
the
next
point
i'm
coming
to.
we
draw
distinction
between
the
use
of
the
word
amendatory
and
part
of.
now,
counsel
for
nashville
in
his
argument
stated
correctly
we
think
at
the
beginning
that
the
question
was
whether
or
not
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
became
part
of
the
clayton
act.
and
then
he
used
the
word
it's
amendatory
to
clayton
act
with
the
assumption
that
any
act
that
was
amendatory
became
part
of
it.
now,
to
us
the
word
amendment
could
have
many
meanings.
it
could
mean
something
becomes
part
of.
for
example,
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act
said,
the
text
--
or
the
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
shall
be
amended
to
read
as
follows.
now,
clearly,
a
substitution
of
text
to
that
kind
becomes
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
and
any
lawyer
looking
to
find
out
what's
in
the
clayton
act
would
find
that
that
act
was
a
part
of
the
clayton
act
by
the
text
revision.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
we
think
it
is
up
to
the
court
if
we
think
that
the
guide
to
the
court
to
determine
what
becomes
part
of
the
act
and
what
is
merely
amendatory
and
not
part
of
it
is
found
in
section
1
of
the
clayton
act.
that
section
provides
antitrust
laws
as
used
herein
includes
then
at
least
by
title,
the
sherman
act,
the
wilson
tariff
act
as
amended
and
this
act,
meaning
the
clayton
act.
now,
it's
shown
in
our
brief
section
1
of
the
clayton
act
was
intended
to
be
exclusionary,
and
to
answer
the
first
question
asked
by
mr.
harlan,
at
the
time
the
clayton
act
was
passed
by
congress,
it
had
only
a
few
weeks
before
passed
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
was
also
an
antitrust
act
in
the
broad
sense.
and
we
think
the
--
one
of
the
--
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
that
definition
of
antitrust
laws
was
put
in
the
clayton
act
was
to
exclude
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
furthermore,
if
congress
had
not
intended
section
1
to
be
exclusionary
in
character,
it
did
not
have
to
define
antitrust
laws
at
all.
all
it
had
to
do
is
use
the
word
antitrust
laws
in
the
body
of
the
clayton
act.
and
any
subsequently
enacted
antitrust
law
would
automatically
be
subject
to
treble
damages
than
the
injunctive
rights
in
private
parties
provided
by
sections
4
and
16
of
the
clayton
act.
so
we
say
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
congress
clearly
intended
that
the
statute
become
part
of
the
clayton
act.
now
another
i
mentioned
the
expressed
amendment
by
revising
the
text.
another
means
congress
has
used
to
indicate
it
wanted
a
section
to
become
part
of
the
clayton
act
is
found
in
the
1955
statute
by
which
congress
gave
the
government
a
private
right
to
sue
or
right
to
sue
for
single
damages
when
it
was
injured
by
reasonable
violation
and
the
section
5
which
they
provided
for
uniform
statute
of
limitation
in
private
treble
damage
suits.
in
that
bill,
congress
said,
the
following
sections,
number
4
(a)
and
4
(b)
shall
be
added
to
the
clayton
act
immediately
following
section
4.
in
those
two
instances,
you
had
a
clear
intention
of
congress
that
the
two
instance
the
robinson
--
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
the
revision
of
this
text
and
this
1955
act.
you
had
a
clear
indication
of
the
intent
of
congress
that
those
sections
were
to
become
part
of
the
clayton
act.
we
do
not
have
anything
like
that
with
respect
to
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes,
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act
clearly
becomes
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
well
the
guide
--
the
guide
post
as
i
see
it
--
i'm
trying
to
think
of
what
other
means
congress
could
use
to
indicate
it
wanted
a
new
law
to
become
part
of
the
clayton
act.
there
is
only
two
ways
i've
been
able
to
think
of,
the
first
is
that
used
in
the
same
robinson-patman
act
in
section
1
of
that
act
when
it
said
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
is
hereby
amended
to
read
as
follows
and
then
encloses
the
new
text
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
in
quotation
marks.
that's
one
means.
and
the
second
one
is
the
other
one
i've
mentioned
that
was
used
in
1955,
specially
stating
a
new
section
shall
be
added
to
the
clayton
act
to
be
numbered
so
and
so
and
inserted
in
the
clayton
act
following
a
particular
section.
i've
unable
to
think
of
any
other
means
which
congress
could
clearly
indicate
it
intended
amendment
to
become
part
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
only
section
1.
that's
the
only
section
that
expressly
revises
the
text
of
the
clayton
act
and
it
writes
a
new
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
2
nor
4
and
not
become
part
of
the
act.
now,
in
the
broad
sense
of
course,
section
4
is
amendatory
of
the
act
because
it
says
that
the
act
shall
not
be
construed
to
prevent
a
proper
case
from
dividends
to
the
members.
but
we
draw
that
line
between
part
of
and
amendatory.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes,
you're
right.
i
stand
corrected.
the
section
as
a
whole
includes
the
cause,
the
initial
phrase
that
section
2
is
hereby
amended
and
so
the
section
as
a
whole
does
not
become
part
of
the
clayton
act,
only
the
--
that
portion
of
section
1
within
quotation
marks.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
no
and
neither
was
3.
the
text
of
the
statute
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
we
don't
--
we
say
that
none
--
neither
2
or
3
nor
4
became
part
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
section
3
is
not
amendatory
of
the
clayton
act.
that
was
my
first
point.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
the
section
--
section
2
is
merely
a
temporary
legislation.
it
provided
a
saving
clause
that
a
pending
litigation
under
the
old
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
before
amendment
should
not
be
affected.
it
also
provided
that
in
case
in
prior
litigation
under
old
section
2
where
the
respondent
in
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
had
subsequent
to
enactment
of
the
clayton
act,
committed
a
violation
of
the
revised
text
of
section
2.
that
in
that
case,
the
federal
trade
commission
could
reopen
the
case
and
proceed
to
prosecute
the
violation
of
the
revised
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
but
clearly,
that
violation
of
the
revised
section
had
to
occur
after
passage
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
we
think
that
that
is
not
amendatory
of
the
clayton
act.
it's
merely
temporary
legislation
dealing
with
particular
situations
but
it
does
not
affect
--
it
does
not
limit
or
control
the
operation
of
the
clayton
act.
clayton
act
too
is
in
full
effect.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
i
don't
think
that
section
2
is
even
amendatory,
your
honor.
but
we
--
our
position
is
such
that
we
concede
that
if
it
might
be
amendatory,
assuming
its
amendatory,
still
is
not
part
of
the
act.
now
section
4
is
clearly
amendatory
of
the
clayton
act
because
it
states
that
nothing
in
this
act
as
referring
to
robinson-patman
act
shall
prevent
cooperatives
from
paying
dividends
to
their
members.
incidentally,
may
we
--
the
text
of
that
that
is
at
page
29
of
the
nashville
brief.
no
one
says
nothing
in
this
act,
the
words
this
act
refer
to
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
it
refers
to
section
1
of
robinson-patman
act
which
contains
the
amendments
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
so
that
it
states
that
nothing
in
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
shall
prevent
cooperatives
from
returning
these
dividends.
now
in
that
sense,
it
is
amendatory
because
it
limits
the
operation
of
the
act
but
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
act.
if
i've
made
my
distinction
clear
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
thank
you.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
it's
nothing
in
this
act
--
nothing
in
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
well,
it
--
it
--
because
it
says
nothing
in
robinson-patman
act,
it
refers
to
--
nothing
in
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
being
a
member
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
in
effect
that
says
nothing
in
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
shall
prevent
cooperatives
in
returning.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes.
now,
section
4
does
not
affect
any
section
of
the
clayton
act
except
--
excuse
me,
except
section
2
is
limited
only
to
section
2.
although
practically
that
makes
no
difference
because
there
is
no
other
section
of
the
clayton
act
to
which
you
could
apply
anyway.
now,
if
our
test
by
distinction
between
a
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
no,
mr.
justice.
i
understand
that
section
4
is
an
answer
only
if
someone
proceeds
against
a
cooperative
under
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
or
under
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
in
any
other
statute?
mr.
melville
c.
williams
it's
an
answer
to
the
claim
if
there
is
a
restriction
upon
cooperatives
by
reason
of
section
3
of
this
act
and
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
section
1
of
this
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
because
it
says
nothing
in
this
act
shall
prevent
a
cooperative
association.
and
this
act
does
not
mean
the
clayton
act
it
refers
to
the
robinson-patman
act
and
all
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
and
all
that
you
find
in
this
act
that
might
prevent
a
cooperative
from
returning
dividends
to
its
members
are
--
is
found
in
1
and
3.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes.
nothing
in
this
robinson-patman
act
shall
prevent.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes,
yes.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
now,
if
our
distinction
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
excuse
me.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
well,
our
distinction
is
between
something
when
the
congress
makes
a
part
of
the
statute
and
amendment.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
but
here's
the
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
here
is
the
significance
of
that.
if
for
example
that
distinction
is
not
sound.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
oh
the
instrument
we
offer
is
section
1
of
the
clayton
act
which
defines
antitrust
laws
as
used
in
the
clayton
act.
it
says
it
includes
the
sherman
act,
the
wilson
tariff
act
and
this
act
which
is
the
clayton
act
itself.
now,
our
point
we
say
that
that
section
is
exclusionary
in
purpose
first
because
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
well,
if
it
is
exclusionary
in
purpose
when
it
says
that
antitrust
laws
shall
mean
these
three
statutes.
it
has
to
mean
something
as
part
of
those
three
statutes
that
cannot
extend
to
anything
that
might
by
any
possible
use
of
imagination
amend
those
statutes
in
a
vague
sense.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes
that's
our
point.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
then
it's
not
within
the
definition
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
section
1
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
well
then
our
last
point
is
the
legislative
history
of
section
3.
when
--
and
the
text
of
the
act
itself
we
draw
different
conclusion
from
the
text
of
the
act
and
has
used
quotation
marks
of
that
drawn
by
nashville.
in
this
very
--
in
this
one
act,
congress
was
specifically
amending
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
it
had
the
process
for
a
member
of
the
clayton
act
in
mind
when
it
wrote
it.
and
therefore
when
it
--
section
1
has
specifically
amended
the
clayton
act
and
did
not
include
section
3
in
part
of
that
amendment.
we
say
that's
the
evidence
that
congress
had
in
mind
and
intended
that
section
3
was
not
to
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act
or
even
to
be
an
amendment
of
it.
the
legislative
history
bears
this
out
when
the
bill
of
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
when
congress
wrote
the
robinson-patman
act,
it
had
in
mind
the
very
question
of
amending
--
of
amending
the
clayton
act
and
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act
expressly
amend
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
by
revising
the
text.
now,
if
congress
had
this
amendment
in
mind
and
it
wished
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
to
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act,
it
would
have
put
it
in
quotation
marks
or
else
it
would
have
used
this
device
of
saying
it
shall
be
added
to
the
clayton
act
as
a
separate
section.
it
did
not
do
so.
and
if
it
did
not
intend
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
no.
and
our
position
of
course
is
that
4
do
not
become
part
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
it
--
it's
amendatory
but
it's
not
part
of.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
that
is
correct.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
with
a
--
with
one
addition
that
if
it
intends
to
be
part
of
it,
it
might
also
state,
it
will
be
a
separate
section
added
to
the
clayton
act
as
4
(a)
or
4
(b)
of
that
type.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
yes,
it
is.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
well,
the
next
point
is
legislative
history.
section
3
originated
as
a
language
of
section
3
originated
in
the
senate
the
language
of
the
borah-van
nuys
bill
which
died
in
the
senate,
now
referred
to
as
the
borah-van
nuys
language.
now
when
the
bill
became
the
robinson-patman
act
was
under
consideration
in
the
house,
a
motion
was
made
to
substitute
the
borah-van
nuys
language
for
the
language
of
the
house
bill.
the
language
of
the
house
bill
at
that
time
was
substantially
the
same
as
it's
now
found
in
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
motion
was
defeated
so
that
when
our
present
--
the
bill
that
became
the
robinson-patman
act
left
the
house,
it
has
the
history
of
the
house
rejection
of
what
is
we
now
find
in
section
3.
when
the
bill
after
enacted
by
the
house,
went
to
the
senate,
the
senate
rewrote
its
text
and
it
added
what
is
now
--
the
language
now
found
in
section
3.
and
it
did
not
add
it
as
a
separate
section
outside
of
quotation
marks
so
we
find
it
today,
it
added
it
as
a
part
of
the
amendment
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
and
made
it
subsection
(h)
within
quotation
marks.
if
that
senate
bill
had
become
the
final
form
of
the
statute,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
section
3
would
purely
be
a
part
of
the
clayton
act
and
one
upon
which
treble
damage
actions
could
be
founded.
so
in
this
posture,
the
two
forms
of
the
bill
went
to
the
conference
committee.
the
conference
committee
compromised
differences
between
the
house
and
the
senate
by
accepting
substantially
the
house
version
of
the
amendment
of
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
which
did
not
contain
the
section
3
language.
and
took
the
borah-van
nuys
language
out
of
where
the
senate
had
placed
it
as
an
amendment
of
the
clayton
act
and
made
it
a
separate
statute
with
a
separate
number
were
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
amendment
of
the
of
clayton
act.
our
position
is
that
that
was
the
liberate
action
by
congress
and
shows
that
it
intended
that
section
3
was
not
to
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
those
quotations
to
us
are
--
confirmed
our
position
and
we
think
that
those
quotations
mean
this,
they
are
somewhat
they
are
not
entirely
clear
as
sometimes
debates
in
congress
are.
but
when
it
is
remembered
that
many
of
the
acts
that
violate
section
1
of
the
robinson-patman
act
or
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended,
also
violates
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
then
we
think
that
the
meaning
of
the
debates
becomes
clear.
what
they
were
talking
about
there
were
the
situations
where
the
same
act
would
violate
both
sections.
and
of
course
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
that
would
be
entirely
possible
were
the
act
of
the
violator
was
prohibited
by
the
criteria
of
amended
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
so
that
he
would
be
subject
to
treble
damage
suit.
and
where
that
very
same
act
also
violated
the
different
criteria
set
forth
in
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
then
the
man
would
be
subject
to
the
criminal
penalties,
and
that
we
think
is
what
they
were
talking
about.
there
are
many
such
instances
because
of
the
section
--
the
first
part
of
amended
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
relates
to
price
discrimination.
the
first
part
of
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
relates
to
price
discrimination.
so
as
you
would
have
many
instances
where
the
same
act
would
violate
both
statutes
and
was
subjected
to
treble
damages
as
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melville
c.
williams
you
said
what
acts
was
(voice
overlap)?
mr.
melville
c.
williams
well,
amended
section
2
does
not
relate
--
does
not
affect
foreign
commerce.section
3
does
relate
the
foreign
commerce.
further,
section
3
has
in
the
third
clause,
it
consists
the
three
basic
clauses.
the
third
clause
states
that
selling
at
unreasonably
low
prices
would
intend
to
injure
competition
or
a
competitor
is
unlawful.
that
is
not
found
in
the
precede
--
in
the
other
sections.
mr.
melville
c.
williams
only
the
criminal
penalty
would
apply
and
that
is
the
section
of
the
act
under
which
this
present
case
arises.
well,
for
the
reasons
stated,
we
submit
that
section
3
is
not
an
amendment
of
the
clayton
act
but
even
if
it
were,
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
clayton
act
and
therefore
it
is
not
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
you
find
in
section
1
for
a
violation
of
which
private
suits
lie
for
treble
damages
and
injunctions.
