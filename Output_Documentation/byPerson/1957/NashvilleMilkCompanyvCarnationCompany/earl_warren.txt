chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
--
i
supposed
if
that
act
you've
just
spoken
have
those
incorporated
in
the
act
the
fact
that
it
was
an
amendatory
acts
of
the
original
act,
it
would
have
some
bearing
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
does
that
lead
you
--
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
when
congress
says
this
is
an
amendatory
act
of
another
act
that
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
pick
and
choose
what
part
is
amendatory
and
what
part
of
the
new
act
becomes
a
part
of
the
old
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
any
part
of
this
act
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act?

justice
earl

determine
--
what
are
the
guide
posts
for
us
to
follow
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
where
does
that
lead
you
here?
what
--
what
sections
of
this
act,
this
robinson-patman
act
to
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
neither
2
nor
4?
chief
justice
earl
warren
2
and
4
were
not
in
quotation
marks,
were
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
differentiate
between
2
and
4
and
--
from
one
end
and
3
on
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
all
amendatory
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now
make
the
distinction
between
3
on
the
one
hand
and
2
and
4
on
the
other
hand
for
me
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
said
it
was
amendatory
but
not
a
part
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you've
stated
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
because
of
what
did
you
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
before
it
either
did
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
what
you
said
it
was
amendatory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
--
in
other
words
you
say
that
congress
has
been
--
if
it
intends
to
make
it
a
part
of
it,
will
put
it
in
quotation
marks
but
if
it
only
means
to
amend
it,
it
will
not
put
it
in
quotation
marks.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
