mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
who
was
the
plaintiff
below
in
a
suit
to
recover
treble
damages
caused
by
injuries
by
violations
of
section
3
of
the
robison-patman
act.
the
question
presented
here
today
in
this
suit
now
is
whether
a
party
injured
by
a
violation
of
section
3
has
the
right
to
sue
for
damages
and
injunction
under
sections
4
and
16
of
the
clayton
act.
underlying
that
issue
is
whether
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
became
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
if
it
did,
then
it's
one
of
the
antitrust
laws
for
which
remedy
is
given
by
sections
4
and
16
of
the
clayton
act.
let
me
describe
the
robinson-patman
act
in
general
now
and
i
would
be
a
little
more
particular
of
it
later
on.
it
consists
of
four
sections.
section
1
of
the
act
or
section
1
of
the
bill
clearly
amended
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
section
2
of
the
bill
and
which
is
also
in
regard
to
section
2
of
the
act
is
a
saving
clause
preserving
rights
of
action
under
pending
causes
of
action.
section
3
is
the
section
in
question
here.
section
4
is
an
exemption
of
cooperative
associations
from
the
provisions
of
the
act.
our
position
briefly
stated
this
time
is
that
the
internal
or
what
might
be
called
an
internal
evidence
consisting
of
the
robinson-patman
act
itself.
and
what
i
might
call
the
external
evidence
consisting
of
the
debates
in
the
proceedings
in
congress,
all,
i
contend,
clearly
show
that
congress
intended
that
all
sections
of
the
robinson-patman
act
should
amend
and
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
let's
get
back
to
the
clayton
act
for
a
moment.
sections
4
and
16
of
the
clayton
act,
respectively,
give
the
rights
of
action
for
treble
damages
and
for
injunction
for
injuries
and
violation
of
“the
antitrust
laws.”
section
1
of
the
clayton
act
defines
antitrust
laws
and
it
provides
that
the
antitrust
law
shall
include
three
named
acts.
these
acts
are
named
by
their
titles.
one
is
the
sherman
act
the
title
is
given.
one
is
the
wilson
tariff
act
and
the
third
is
the
clayton
act
itself.
therefore,
whether
a
cause
of
action
exist
to
the
plaintiff
here
under
section
3
of
the
robinson-patman
act
depends
upon
whether
of
not
section
3,
became
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
we
contend
it
did
by
amendment.
now
the
--
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
the
sherman
act?
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
and
the
wilson
tariff
act.
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
that
i
(voice
overlap)
--
that
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
can't
--
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
i
can't
say
that.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
i
don't
know.
now
the
title
and
the
enacting
clause,
the
act
itself
is
setup
in
the
appendix
1
of
our
brief,
starting
at
page
25.
the
title
and
the
enacting
clause
refer
only
to
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
the
enacting
clause
purports
to
amend
only
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
the
court
of
appeals
also
i
should
say
that
quotation
marks
appear
before
and
after
the
various
paragraphs
of
section
1.
but
they
do
not
appear
before
any
of
the
subsequent
sections,
section
2,
3
and
4.
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
because
the
enacting
clause
only
referred
to
section
2
and
because
of
the
presence
of
those
quotation
marks
only
before
and
after
the
very
paragraphs
of
section
2
that
that
showed
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
section
3
should
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act
by
amendment.
it
is
our
position
that
whether
or
not
section
3
amended
and
became
a
part
of
the
clayton
act,
depends
upon
what
congress
intended
regardless
of
whether
or
not
section
3
was
referred
to
in
the
enacting
clause
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
there
were
quotation
marks
that
it
is
a
question
of
the
intent
of
congress
and
that
the
intention
of
congress
is
not
to
be
overwritten
by
the
presence
of
the
quotation
marks
only
before
and
after
section
1
and
because
of
the
nature
of
this
particular
enacting
clause.
it
is
our
position
that
the
entire
robinson-patman
act
was
amendatory
of
the
clayton
act
and
that
all
four
sections
of
the
robinson-patman
act
are
in
an
integrated
part
as
a
whole.
now,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
--
the
attention
of
the
court
first
of
all
to
the
fact
that
quotation
marks
are
absent
from
sections
2
and
4
as
well
as
absent
in
section
3.
now,
section
2
as
i've
stated
before,
is
this
section
that
preserve
pending
causes
of
action.
clearly,
section
2
was
amendatory
of
the
clayton
act
itself
because
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
or
it
doesn't
go
to
the
heart
but
it
affects
section
1,
equally
absent
with
from
quotation
marks
is
section
4.
section
4
is
the
exemption
of
cooperatives.
clearly,
section
4
amended
the
clayton
act
because
the
exemption
affects
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
section
1.
now,
if
these
two
sections
clearly
amended
the
clayton
act
in
the
absence
of
quotation
marks,
surely,
the
absence
of
quotation
marks
would
not
prevent
section
3
from
amending
the
clayton
act.
there
is
another
matter
of
conserve
or
importance
in
connection
with
section
2.
it
appears
to
28
--
page
28
--
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
of
the
--
of
my
brief.
pardon
me,
your
honor.
that
nothing
contained
herein
shall
affect
rights
of
action
arising
or
litigation
pending
--
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
what's
that?
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
pending
or
orders
the
federal
trade
commission
issued
on
the
effect
or
pending
on
review
based
on
section
2
of
the
said
act
of
october
15th,
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
this
amendatory
act.
now,
the
adjective
“amendatory”
with
the
noun
“act”
is
not
only
used
in
an
isolated
instance
there
but
it's
again
used
in
the
next
line,
your
honor,
amendatory
act
and
then
about
the
six
lines
down
amendatory
act.
and
then
about
five
or
six
lines
from
the
bottom,
again,
amendatory
act
so
that
congress
by
its
own
words
clearly
characterized
the
entire
act
as
being
an
amendatory
act.
we
--
it's
a
familiar
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
every
word
used
in
a
statute
is
suppose
to
have
been
used
deliberately
and
upon
a
purpose
unless
it
can
be
said
clearly
to
the
contrary
that
it's
a
desperate
unnecessary
word.
and
i
say
that
when
congress
in
section
2
used
the
word
amendatory
act
four
times,
congress
clearly
characterized
the
entire
act
as
being
an
amendatory
act.
then
another
element
that
indicates
clearly
that
congress
intended
the
entire
act
to
be
amendatory.
the
cooperative
exemption.
the
cooperative
exemption
in
section
4,
nothing
in
this
act
shall
prevent
a
cooperative
association
and
so
on.
now,
that
applied
--
that
exemption
applies
indifferently
not
only
to
section
3
but
to
section
1.
so
that
section
4
is,
as
i've
stated
before,
clearly
a
part
of
the
--
had
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act
and
if
having
referred
indifferently
to
both
sections
to
--
for
the
exemption
to
having
applied
differently
to
both.
there
is
additional
strong
evidence
that
all
four
sections
were
intended
to
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
it
is
our
further
position
that
the
--
what
the
act
itself
did,
that
is
the
robinson-patman
act,
was
to
simply
raise
the
horizon
of
old
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
and
continue
it
in
an
extended
matter
beyond
what
section
2
had
originally
applied
but
it's
simply
raised
the
horizon
of
that
act
and
that
all
sections
of
the
robinson-patman
act
are
integrated
parts
of
the
whole.
let
me
call
your
honors'
attention
and
it
might
take
me
the
time
here
as
to
the
nature
in
that
respect
of
section
3
and
a
comparison
of
section
3
with
section
2
or
section
1
of
the
act
and
section
2
of
the
--
section
1
of
the
bill
but
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended.
now
section
1
of
the
--
or
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
before
its
amendment
had
dealt
primarily
and
above
all
with
matter
of
price
discrimination.
in
the
morton
salt
case,
this
court
commented
that
the
original
section
2
had
been
construed
to
permit
quantity
discounts
and
the
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
was
to
limit
this
practice.
now,
section
2
in
its
amendment,
takes
former
section
2
and
makes
some
changes
on
it
but
retains
the
provision
as
to
price
discrimination
which
is
at
primary
--
was
its
primary
provision
before
and
still
remained
it
primary
provision.
then
it
divides
the
entire
section
up
into
paragraphs
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
(e),
and
(f).
at
paragraph
(b)
places
the
burden
of
rebutting
a
prima
facie
case
before
the
federal
trade
commission
about
a
person
charged
with
this
violation.
now,
(c),
(d),
(e)
--
(c),
(d)
and
(e)
are
parts
--
the
forbidding
parts
in
addition
to
paragraph
(a).
i'll
come
back
to
them
in
just
a
moment
if
you'll
permit
me.
now,
let
me
go
to
section
3
before
i
make
this
comparison
with
the
other
section.
it
consists,
why
it
was
not
paragraphed,
it
consists
in
essence
of
three
parts.
one
part
forbids
discrimination
by
selling
goods
in
any
part
of
the
united
states
that
price
is
lower
than
those
who
have
acted
elsewhere
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
another,
to
sell
goods
that
are
unreasonably
low
prices
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
competition.
then
the
third,
to
discriminate
against
competitors
of
the
purchaser
in
granting
any
discount,
rebate,
allowance
or
advertising
service
to
a
purchaser
over
and
above
a
similar
grants
available
competitors
to
respective
goods
of
like
grade,
quality
and
quantity.
now
section
1
is
similar
in
many
respects
or
that
the
number
one,
the
one
i
just
put
ahead,
i
marked
here
one,
excuse
me.
what
i
last
read
to
discriminate
against
competitors
of
purchasers
and
grantingany
discount
is
similar
in
many
respects
to
paragraph
(c)
of
section
2.
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
engaged
in
commerce
in
the
course
to
such
commerce
to
pay
or
grant
or
to
receive
or
accept
adding
of
value
as
a
commission,
brokerage
or
other
compensations
or
any
allowance
or
discount
in
lieu
thereof
of
getting
back
to
the
language
or
section
3
to
discriminate
against
competitors
of
the
purchaser
and
granting
any
discount,
rebate,
allowance
or
advertising
service.
now,
paragraph
(d)
shows
another
similarity.
i'm
trying
to
show
that
--
what
i'm
trying
to
show
here
is
that
section
3
is
in
the
same
area,
general
area
as
these
parts
forbidden
in
section
2.
i
don't
contend
they're
identical.
i
say
they
are
in
the
same
area
and
they
are
striking
at
monopolistic
practices
in
--
principally
in
the
field
of
the
sale
of
merchandise,
goods,
wares
and
merchandise,
all
of
them
strike
at
that
monopolistic
practice
in
those
fields.
section
3
or
section
(d),
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
person
engaged
in
commerce
to
pay
your
contract
with
a
payment
of
granting
the
value
to
or
with
the
benefit
of
a
customer
of
such
person
in
the
course
of
such
commerce
as
compensation
for
or
in
consideration
of
any
services
or
facilities,
facilities
furnished
by
such
customer
in
connection
with
the
processing,
handling
or
offering
for
sale
of
such
product.
now
compare
that
with
section
3
which
forbids
to
discriminate
against
competitors
for
the
purchase
and
granting
any
discount,
rebate,
allowance
or
advertising
service.
clearly,
that
any
service
furnished
in
connection
to
the
sale
of
products,
would
include
and
might
include
the
furnishing
of
advertising
services.
then
(e),
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
one
purchaser
against
another
or
purchasers
of
commonality,
bought
for
resale
with
or
without
processing
by
contracting
to
furnish
or
furnishing
of
any
services
or
facilities
connected
with
the
processing,
handling,
sale
or
offer
sales
as
commodity.
that
deals
with
goods
or
resale
but
it's
substantially
similar
to
(d)
which
i
have
just
read.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
considered
also
that
the
proceedings
in
congress
indicated
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
section
3
should
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
my
position
is
that
it
is
just
the
reverse
that
a
fair
reading
of
what
was
said
shows
that
it
was
the
clear
intention
of
the
members
that
section
3
should
become
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
it
is
just
the
reverse
of
the
position
the
court
took.
if
the
court
will
permit
me
this
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
take
out
of
context
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
there.
they
not
only
took
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
out
of
context
but
the
court,
in
quoting
from
something
said
by
representative
miller,
forgot
to
complete
the
sentence
to
represent
what
miller
used
within
the
period
so
that
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
--
i'll
come
back
to
this
in
a
minute
but
i
just
want
to
point
this
out.
it's
significant

of
the
record,
your
honor.
now,
we're
at
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph
where
it
says
emphasis
apply.
it
is
said
that
of
course
it
is
but
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
what
--
turning
to
page
38
in
my
brief,
what
represented
miller
did
say
down
at
just
about
halfway
down
on
my
brief
where
representative
miller
start
saying,
“of
course
it
is”
at
page
38,
halfway
down
just
before
the
star.
i
represent
him,
of
course
it
is
but
a
denial
as
part
of
the
clayton
act
is
amended
by
section
2.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
left
out
by
its
stars
there
is
amended
by
section
2
and
they
have
taken
that
out
of
context.
now,
they
committed
two
errors,
first
they
took
representative
miller's
statement
out
of
the
context
and
secondly
they
didn't
complete
the
sentence.
now,
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
fully
understand
what
was
said
from
the
floor
of
the
house.
that
is
taken
from
the
floor
of
the
house
when
the
house
was
considering
that
the
bill
was
final
before
a
final
passage.
in
order
to
fully
understand
what
representative
miller
was
talking
about
and
to
fully
understand
what
i'm
about
to
say
here
that
the
record
clearly
shows
that
it
was
intended
that
the
robinson-patman
act
should
have
amended
the
clayton
act.
you
have
to
read
a
number
of
things
here
and
i
don't
want
to
read
and
i
know
most
courts
ground
upon
reading
but
it
is
so
important
to
read
it
fully
so
you
get
the
full
context.
if
the
court
will
permit
me
to
do
a
small
amount
of
reading
here.
representative

was
a

and
representative

incidentally
it
doesn't
appear.
while
he's
a
member
of
the

he
didn't
like
the

by

simply
want
to
get
the
record
clear
because
--
and
then
he
said
rather
prophetically
in
view
of
what
here
he
said,
endeavoring
you
interpret
properly
the
language
of
statutes,
the
courts
must
first
look
to
the
statements
that
appear
in
the
record
in
debate.
now,
he
goes
on,
he
discussed
the
features
of
the
bill.
he
then
yielded
if
for
questions.
the
first
question
came
from
representative
(inaudible)
i
understand
that
borah-van
nuys
is
a
separate
and
distinct
section
from
the
whole
provisions
at
some
of
the
contraries
on
the
part
of
the
house
state
in
me.
there
is
no
inconsistency
and
the
house
provisions
for
bail
but
that
the
borah-van
nuys
amended
was
simply
an
additional
remedy.
mr.
celler,
i
ask
the
this
gentleman
to
read
section
3,
the
borah-van
nuys
provision
and
then
read
section
2
and
section
1
and
see
whether
that
is
so.
and
let
me
point
out
that
this
bill
is
an
amendment
of
the
clayton
act
which
provides
that
anyone
agrees
to
find
discrimination
price
or
discount
or
allowance
consumed
or
cover
treble
damages
from
the
person
guilty
of
discrimination.
in
addition
to
same
act
of
discrimination
as
treble
damages,
the
businessman
can
by
section
3
of
the
bill
be
held
the
court
and
fine
$5000
or
imprisonment.
now
skipping
along,
mr.
celler,
then
he
goes
out,
if
a
vendor
is
found
guilty
of
discrimination
as
provided
earlier
(inaudible)
agree
so
far
as
treble
damages.
mr.
celler,
if
he
violates
provisions
of
borah-van
nuys
provisions
of
the
bill
will
be
in
subject
to
penalties
or
a
criminal
nature
and
you
committed
the
offense.
mr.
hancock,
would
he
also
be
liable
for
triple
damages?
mr.
celler,
“he
would
also
have
to
respond
in
treble
damages
under
the
provisions
of
the
clayton
act
anyone
can
agree
and
can
sue”.
then
representative
miller
took
up.
representative
miller
then
began
explaining.
representative
miller
also
had
been
a
member
of
the
conference
committee.
he
then
began
explaining
the
various
features
of
the
bill
then
this
colloquy
we
occurred
on
page
37.
section
3
is
the
borah-van
nuys
amendment.
we
accepted
this
amendment
for
the
reason
and
this
reason
only.
the
first
section
that
bill
is
reported
back
here,
amends
section
2
of
the
clayton
act.
i
see
my
time
is
--
does
the
bill
agreed
to
by
the
contraries
carry
the
penalty
of
triple
damages
and
also
upon
the
earnings
of
criminal
law.he
said
the
penalty
of
treble
damages
is
the
old
law.
in
other
words,
we
made
no
change
in
that
particular
provision
of
the
clayton
act.
section
3
which
the
gentleman
from
new
york
talks
about
is
the
borah-van
nuys
amendment
and
is
that
is
a
criminal
section.
the
first
part
of
this
bill
has
nothing
to
do
with
criminal
offenses.
it
deals
primarily
in
my
opinion
with
the
authority
of
the
federal
trade
commission
to
regulate
and
enforce
provisions
in
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
is
amended.
section
3
of
the
bill
is
placed
in
effort
to
make
the
criminal
effects
apply
only
to
that
particular
section
and
i
believe
it
is
a
reasonable
construction.
there
is
not
criminal
offense
involved
or
anything
outside
or
within
that
section.
in
section
3,
mr.
hancock
of
new
york,
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
that
any
vendor
who
discriminates
in
price
between
purchasers
is
guilty
of
a
crime
and
is
also
subject
to
triple
damages
to
anyone
who
claims
to
be
aggrieved.
mr.
miller:
“that
is
true
but
the
criminal
part
is
included
in
section
3
and
section
3
only."
mr.
hancock
of
new
york:
“but
it
is
part
--
is
part
of
the
same
act.”
then
here
is
the
part
that
the
court
quoted,
the
court
of
appeals:
“of
course
it
is
but
it
is
not
--
the
clayton
act
is
amended
by
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
is
amended
by
section
2.”
all
he
was
calling
attention
to
was
the
fact
that
the
other
--
section
3
did
not
amend
section
2
and
that
the
criminal
--
the
criminal
provision
of
the
act
applied
to
section
3
and
section
3
only.”
now,
mr.
celler
“is
it
possible
for
a
man
to
violate
section
3,”
may
i
finish
this
sentence?
mr.
jerome
f.
dixon
section
3
and
by
the
same
act
guilty
of
violating
the
other
sections
of
the
bill.
that
would
be
entirely
possible.
mr.
celler:
“so
he
would
be
subject
to
triple
damages
as
well
as
a
criminal
prosecution?”
mr.
miller:
“that
would
be
possible.”
and
mr.
miller
concludes
member
of
the
conference
committee.
mr.
speaker
“i
want
to
say
that
congress
--
that
congress
really
wants
a
bill
to
amend
the
clayton
act
and
desires
amending
the
clayton
act
and
--
and
desires
to
retain
the
three
objectives
of
the
house
bill.”
this
is
the
bill.
in
other
words
he
ends
up
that
way.
pardon
my
shortness,
your
honor.
