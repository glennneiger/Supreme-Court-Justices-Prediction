may
i
ask
a
question
mr.
williams
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
section
4
i
find
your
--
the
chief
justice
indicated
you've
meant
to
be
what
you've
said
but
i
find
it
as
little
artificial.
take
section
4,
all
that
means
if
i
read
here,
that
if
anybody
for
any
reason
or
for
anything
of
appearing
anywhere
on
statute
books
of
united
states
or
some
court
decision,
i
don't
know
how
the
diversity
case
(inaudible)
if
anybody
objects
to
the
payment
of
returning
--
part
of
that
earning
et
cetera,
brings
forth
some
--
some
patterns
of
law
whether
by
congress
or
by
a
court
against
cooperative
doing
these
things,
section
4
is
announced.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
somebody
or
some
astute
lawyer
discovered
some
sleeping
section
which
was
barred,
which
would
bring
such
an
action,
that
is
in
section
4
isn't
restrict.
it
says
nothing
in
this
act
shall
prevent
a
cooperative
from
returning
to
its
members.
this
is
an
answer
to
any
claim
that
there
is
such
a
restriction
upon
cooperative,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
really
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
do
you
limit
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
in
this
act
shall
prevent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you've
got
to
look
at
--
you've
got
to
look
at
the
provisions
of
this
statute
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
reclaim
it.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did
say
something
about
amending
or
not
amending.
i
think
they're
awfully
artificial
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
the
distinction
but
this
to
me,
in
elaborate
way
of
getting
at
reading
a
statute
to
find
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
effect
of
a
statute
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
the
result
isn't
sound.
i'm
objecting
to
the
category
--
the
instruments
which
you
offer
me
for
answering
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
that
but
you
need
to
spell
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
difficulty
is
that
--
that's
where
my
mind
goes.
i
don't
have
to
go
to
a
mechanical
determination
whether
i
can
state
--
i
can
say
it
with
words
and
say
it's
amendatory
in
some
sense
and
not
--
i
don't
have
to
go
and
say
if
it's
amendatory
then
it's
shoved
in
there.
if
it's
part
of
it,
it
shoved
in
because
then
it
becomes
part
of
this
act,
is
that
right?
that's
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
if
it
isn't
part
of
it
then
it
isn't
--
then
it
isn't
in
the
clayton
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
i
can
reach
that
conclusion
without
going
through
that
mechanical
part
of
the
thing.
is
it
amendatory
or
is
it
a
part
of
it.
never
mind.
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
quotation
i'm
really
getting.
to
make
this
--
needlessly
elaborate
when
congress
said,
we
amend
from
prior
statute
to
read
as
follows,
“perhaps
a
displacement
of
the
text
which
thereafter
is
out
and
the
text
to
which
any
lawyer
or
any
judge
looks
is
that
which
is
placed
in
quotation
marks”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
accurate
--
accurate
statement
of
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
do
i
have
to
follow
the
old
way
if
it's
amendatory
or
part
of.
it
seems
evidently
you've
got
to
help
out
of
it
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
what
i
know.
