mr.
leonard
b.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
petitioner
and
the
government
on
agreement
as
to
what
constitutes
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
to
discern
the
intent
of
congress.
what
has
congress
made
the
allowable
unit
of
prosecution
under
this
statute?
this
case
is
therefore,
free
of
any
problems
of
--
of
constitutional
law,
of
double
jeopardy,
of
consecutive
trials
such
as
represented
in
the
two
preceding
cases.
nor
is
there
involved
here
as
they
were
--
as
there
was
in
the
prince
case
decided
last
term
whether
congress,
whether
earlier
steps
which
later
were
consummated
in
a
finally
completed
crime,
are
merged
with
that
final
crime.
this
is
a
punishment
case.
an
issue
now
before
this
court
is
whether
congress
intended
that
a
defendant,
hereby,
a
single
discharge
of
a
shotgun
releasing
the
many
shotgun
pellets
who
assaulted
two
federal
officers
and
who
intended
two
assault
two
federal
officers
on
account
of
the
performance
of
their
official
duties
because
the
statute
requires
that
there'd
be
that
specific
intent
as
to
each
of
the
federal
officers
assaulted
whether
such
a
defendant
might
be
punished
more
severely
than
one
who
assaults
only
a
single
officer.
to
discern
congressional
intent,
we
begin
of
course
with
--
with
the
statute
itself.
and
the
reading
of
the
statute,
the
government
submits,
discloses
that
the
unit
protected,
the
individual
federal
officer,
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
the
performance
by
that
officer
of
his
official
duties
and
the
intent
of
the
defendant
required
by
the
statute
to
be
a
specific
intent
to
assault
that
individual
federal
officer
for
a
reason
specified
in
the
statute.
these
are
all
personal
and
individual
as
to
each
federal
officer.
and,
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
the
assault
on
each
officer
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties
is
accepted
offense
and
the
number
of
shots
fired
is
immaterial.
this
the
government
submits,
appears
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
but
if
the
language
is
ambiguous,
we
look
to
the
legislative
history
and
the
government
shall
attempt
to
show
that
that
legislative
history
also
reveals
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
protect
each
and
every
federal
officer
and
that
therefore
that
is
the
unit
of
crime.

the
record
in
this
case
consist
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
--
mr.
leonard

indictment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but,
we
--
we
know
from
the
indictment
--
from
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
something
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
apparently,
what
happened
is
there
was
a
raid
on
the
steal
by
alcohol
tax
unit
officers.
and
some
persons
there
were
arrested
and
the
federal
officers
were
taking
the
arrested
persons
to
some
place
to
confine
and
to
arraignment.
and
the
two
federal
officers
proceeded
next
to
each
other
on
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile.
the
defendant
ladner
and
his
co-defendant
came
to
this
point
and
the
indictment
alleges
with
loaded
shotguns
in
(inaudible)
assaulted
these
--
these
federal
officers.
this
--
this
is
as
--
as
much
of
the
fact
as
--
as
we've
known.
the
government
does
not
rely
on
the
--
on
the
affidavit
which
is
printed
in
the
record
in
which
was
introduced
at
the
first
trial
but
was
introduced
apparently
for
purposes
of
teaching
the
witness.
we
--
we
do
not
as
the
court
--
as
the
court
of
appeals
have
not,
we
do
not
rely
on
that.
realizing
that
--
that
he
must
seize
upon
some
element
which
will
unify,
what
would
otherwise,
under
accepted
common
law
concepts,
be
two
crimes.
petitioner
seizes
upon
the
last
clause
of
the
statute
with
--
which
relates
to
the
use
of
a
--
of
a
deadly
weapon.
but
clearly
the
purpose
of
that
clause
is
merely
to
increase
punishment.
no
separate
crime
is
defined
in
the
--
in
the
second
clause
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
this
is
--
the
provision
with
respect
to
use
of
a
gun
in
this
statute
is
exactly
parallel
to
that
in
the
bank
robbery
statute
and
in
other
statutes
and
it
has
been
held
and
recognized
by
this
court
and
in
holiday
against
johnson
and
other
cases
that
that
does
not
constitute
a
--
a
separate
crime
but
merely
increases
the
punishment
for
the
crime
which
is
defined
in
the
earlier
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
if
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
--
i
--
it's
--
it's
a
negative
argument,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i'm
merely
--
i
am
merely
rejecting
the
contention
that
the
crime
is
defined
in
this
--
in
the
second
clause.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
the
government
proved
that
he
assaulted
federal
officer
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
each,
with
a
deadly
weapon
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
each
officer
with
that
specific
content.
the
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
also
supports
this
concept
that
the
later
provision
is
--
is
but
a
--
a
penalty
provision.
and
the
letter
of
the
attorney
general
through
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
which
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
14
and
15
of
petitioner's
brief
makes
clear
the
purpose
of
congress
to
protect
the
individual
federal
officers.
this
is
not
a
statute
such
as
the
abstraction
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
that
it
--
it
made
no
difference
that
the
federal
government
whether
--
whether
there
was
one
shot
or
two,
it
made
a
difference
was
--
was
there
a
wrong
directed
at
--
at
each
and
every
federal
officer
that
the
letter
refers
to
the
need
for
the
protection
of
--
of
federal
officers
and
employees,
and
the
likes,
that
several
had
been
assaulted
in
the
course
of
the
year.
there
are
statutes
where
--
where
congress
speaks
of
--
of
the
obstruction
of
the
mail
or
--or
some
other
intangible
concept
of
--
of
that
(inaudible)
this
is
not
such
a
statute.
this
deals
with
--
with
human
beings
and
--and
whether
somebody
who
intends
to
inflict
an
injury
on
--
on
more
than
one
person
can
be
punished
more
severely
because
of
the
wrong
inflicted
on
--
on
the
second
person.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
if
--if
he
resisted
the
--
the
single
officer
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
say,
in
the
first
instance,
that
we
are
not
operating
under
those
provisions
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
problems
with
respect
to
acts
of
resistance,
opposition
and
intimidation
are
more
serious.
i
--
i
think
it's
more
difficult
there
to
determine
the
--
the
allowable
unit
of
crime.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
no,
mr.
justice
black.
i
--
perhaps
i
haven't
misspoken
myself
but
the
--
the
clause
of
the
statute
which
appeared
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
not
the
first
clause
but
appears
on
lines
five
and
six
of
the
statute,
“or
shall
assault
him
on
the
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.”
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
my
rule
would
apply
with
this
--
with
this
limitation.
before
a
jury
could
convict
as
to
any
particular
federal
officer,
he
would
have
to
find
that
there
was
an
act
of
--
of
force
or
violence
or
--
or
whatever
it
is.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
sir
directed
at
that
federal
officer
for
the
reason
in
the
statute.
this
would
then
be
a
matter
of
proof
for
--
for
the
jury
to
determine
at
the
trial
as
matter
of
pleading
and
indictment
which
alleged
that
acts
of
resistance
as
to
nine
or
10
or
whatever
the
--
the
number
might
be,
would
--
would
be
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
pleading
there'd
be
questions
of
--
of
proof
for
the
jury
to
resolve
at
the
trial.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
--
he
might
in
the
--
in
the
given
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
--
he
might
and
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
congress
to
say
in
the
case
like
that
--
that
where
you're
--
you're
doing
this
wrong,
it's
directed
at
these
persons
the
number
of
persons
at
whom
you've
directed
the
wrong
is
--
is
a
--
is
a
consideration
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
in
deciding
how
seriously
your
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
you
offense
is.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i'd
--i'd
--
in
certain
cases,
i
think
--
i
think
there
might
--
that
there
are
differences
between
--
between
the
provisions
with
respect
to
assault
as
they
appear
in
--
in
the
statute
and
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
the
others.
for
instance,
with
respect
to
resistance,
the
--
the
elements
in
the
first
two
statutes
there's
a
requirement
that
it'd
be
while
he
was
engaged
in
the
performance
of
his
official
duties,
perhaps
there,
there's
no
requirement
that
--
that
be
the
reason
for
his
acts
if
in
fact
he
is
--
he
is
performing
official
duties.
when
it
comes
to
assault,
there
the
assault
has
to
be
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.
he
has
to
know
that
the
individual
he's
assaulting
is
a
federal
officer
and
he
has
to
--
the
reason,
the
motive
and
the
intent
has
to
be
to
assault
him
for
this
specific
reason.
and
so
it
becomes
a
very
individualized
matter
and
--
and
the
--
the
--
it
--
it
would
not
be
possible
under
the
statute,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
proof
to
a
jury,
to
--magnify
the
--
the
number
of
offenses
beyond
reason.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
if
he
had
the
ability
it
--
it
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
there
not
people
--
there
were
not
so
many
people
there
that
he
could
in
fact
have
--
have
inflicted
bodily
injury
on
them
all.
it's
a
requirement
of
--
under
the
common
law
concepts
of
assault,
that
there'd
be
at
least
to
be
present
there,
at
least
the
apparent
is
not
the
actual
ability
to
--
to
injure
to
inflict
bodily
injury
on
all
those
present.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
i
take
my
fist
for
a
month.
mr.
leonard
b.

yes.
mr.
leonard
b.

yes
it
would
and

mr.
leonard

well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
as
--
as
a
matter
--
as
i
say
it's
a
matter
of
pleading.
i
--
i
think
that
there
could
be
as
many
counts
as
--
as
there
--
as
there
were
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
as
a
matter
of
pleading.
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
limitation
arises
from
--
from
the
requirements
of
--
of
the
law
of
assault.
and
that
is
that
--
that
there
must
be
an
intent
with
respect
to
the
person
assaulted,
must
be
under
such
circumstances
as
to
create
a
reasonable
apprehension
upheld.
and
there
must
be
the
--
the
apparent
if
not
the
actual
ability
to
--
to
--
to
inflict
the
injury.
if
all
those
are
present,
if
--if
this
--
this
man
with
the
machine
gun
could,
in
fact,
have
mowed
down
to
--
these
are
colloquial
expressions
--
all
of
them
that
then
--
then
even
as
matter
of
proof.
congress
had
as
much
right
to
protect
the
tenth
or
the
eleventh
federal
officer
from
an
assault
as
--
as
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
in
the
--
the
bell
case,
the
--
the
court
was
dealing
with
--
with
the
mann
act.
the
constitutional
justification
of
which
was
interstate
transportation
and
the
court
specifically
noted
that.
mr.
leonard
b.

the
--
the
legislative
history
was

the
legislative
history
shows
that
there
was
an

mr.
leonard
b.

well,
i
--
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
statute.
i
think
--
i
think
and
what
it
shows
is
that
the
intent
was
not
to
protect,
not
to
protect
interstate
commerce
which
justification
required
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
yes.
one
--
one
would
be
enough
but
--
but,
nevertheless,
because
this
was
the
--
the
basis
for
the
statute
that
the
court
could
not
say
that
although
congress
could
only
pass
the
statute
under
the
--
under
the
commerce
clause
and
could
only
--
could
only
protect
the
interstate
commerce
and
could
not
because
it
lacked
--
there
was
no
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
protect
the
--
the
individual
women
involved.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
disregard
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
--
here,
the
fact
was
for
federal
jurisdiction,
of
course,
is
each
individual
federal
officer
and
the
legislative
history
bears
out
the
fact
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
do
just
that,
was
to
protect
each
--
each
federal
officer.
the
case
such
as
the
dimenza
case
and
the
--
the
other
lower
court
case
which
dealt
with
the
bank
robbery
and
--
and
jeopardizing
--
putting
lives
in
jeopardy
while
robbing
a
bank
are
also
distinguishable
even
if
it
be
conceded,
argue
and
of
those
cases
are
properly
decided
because
there,
the
unit
being
protected
was
the
bank
and
the
provision
there
construed
was
as
--
as
the
second
clause
here
an
aggravating
provision.
finally,
the
government
respectfully
calls
this
court's
attention
to
the
question
presented
by
this
case
as
to
the
availability
of
collateral
attack
if
it
be
deemed
that
the
number
of
shots
fired
was
material.
there's
no
allegation
here
if
procedural
unfairness
or
lack
of
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court,
petitioner
is
saying,
“i
have
a
defense.
i
only
fired
one
shot
and
the
statute
requires
two.
i
didn't
apparently
raise
this
below.
i
didn't
take
an
appeal
but
permit
me
now,
on
--
on
collateral
attack
although
nothing
subsequent
has
--
has
occurred
to
change
the
--
the
legal
issues
involved
to
attack
the
judgment
and
to
send
all
of
them
enlarged
in
similar
cases,
the
government
submits
that
the
judgment
is
not
a
sale
but
on
collateral
attack
for
those
reasons.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
indicated
this
is
a
punishment
case.
the
questions
involved
in
this
case
are
solely
ones
of
statutory
construction.
in
the
next
case
that
the
court
will
hear,
the
abbate
case,
we
will
return
to
problems
of
successive
trials
by
state
and
federal
government.
problems
of
--
of
double
jeopardy
and
federal
supremacy,
but
there
are
no
constitutional
problems
in
this
case.
there
are
no
problems
of
successive
trials.
the
problem
is
one
of
concerning
the
intent
of
congress,
the
unit
of
crime
which
congress
indicated,
it
intended
in
this
particular
statute.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
this
statute
which
deals
with
a
crime
of
violence
against
the
person
and
uses
the
term
“assault”
a
term
which
has
a
recognized
and
defined
meaning
at
the
common
law,
makes
the
unit
of
the
crime.
each
individual
federal
officer
assaulted
with
the
intent
which
the
statute
requires.
and
it
is
clear,
we
believe,
that
at
the
common
law,
where
a
person
intends
a
crime
of
violence
against
the
person,
each
victim
constitutes
a
separate
crime
and
we
have
--
we
have
summarized
in
our
brief,
the
state
court
cases
to
that
effect.
or
it
emphasized
that
we're
dealing
in
that
statute
with
the
clause
or
shall
assault
him
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.
there
is
other
language
in
the
statute,
but
that
does
not
--
the
language
which
appears
in
counts
2
and
3
of
the
indictment,
which
are
the
counts
which
are
now
before
the
court.
so
this
--
the
problem
before
the
court
is
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
says,
“assault
him,
the
federal
officer,
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.”
required
that
there'd
be
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
direct
an
assault
against
each
particular
federal
officer.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think,
if
a
jury
could
find
that
he
intended
to
direct
an
act
of
--
of
violence,
an
act
of
--
of
bodily
harm
against
the
individual
before
him
and
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties,
if
there
was
that
specific
individual
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
with
respect
to
the
persons
before
him.
and
if
he
had
the
--
the
actual
ability
to
inflict
bodily
harm
against
those
persons
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury,
whether
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
if
--
if,
in
fact,
by
his
weapon
he
could
have
injured
all
10
persons,
if
they
were
so
huddled
together
and
the
weapon
which
he
used
was
a
weapon
which
was
capable
of
inflicting
a
bodily
injury
on
10
persons.
if
it
was
a
--
a
bomb,
a
grenade,
then
i
think
the
jury
could
--
could
find
that
there
were
10
offenses
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
--
if
the
jury
would
--
could
find
it
as
under
those
facts,
i
think
a
jury
could
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
that
there
was
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
inflict
bodily
harm
on
each
of
those
persons
and
the
defendant
has
the
ability
to
inflict
that
harm.
i
think
that
--
that
congress
--
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
protect
each
and
every
one
of
those
federal
officers.
this
is
not
a
statute
which
deals
with
a
government
function.
this
is
not
a
statute
which
says
“whoever
obstructs
the
passage
of
a
mail
shall
be
guilty
of
a
crime.”
there
--
if
there
were
several
acts,
all
of
which
are
designed
to
affect
one
obstruction
of
the
mail,
of
course,
there's
one
offense.
but
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
to
which
i
--
i
shall
come
shortly
and
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
indicates
that
it
was
congress'
intent
to
protect
the
federal
officers,
the
human
beings,
not
--
not
an
abstract
concept.
the
--
the
legislative
history
is
--
is
i
think,
significant
in
this
respect
because
in
the
letter
of
the
attorney
general
and
i
am
--
i
have
reference
now
to
pages
14
and
15
of
the
brief
for
petitioner
in
this
case.
and
this
was
the
letter
of
the
attorney
general
to
the
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
he
judiciary
in
which
he
requested
that
this
--
the
--
the
passing
of
statutes
of
--
of
this
sort.
and
he
talks
in
--
in
the
second
paragraph
on
page
14,
of
the
need
for
general
legislation
for
the
protection
of
federal
officers
and
employees.
and
he
goes
on
to
talk
and
the
last
sentence
on
page
14
and
we
first
--
continued
on
page
15
of
the
agents,
several
of
whom
have
been
assaulted
in
the
course
of
the
year,
while
in
the
performance
of
their
official
duties.
contrary
and
--
and
that,
of
course,
was
the
intent
which
is
embodied
in
the
statute,
an
intent
to
protect
federal
officers
against
assault.
now,
counsel
for
petitioner
suggest
that
if
the
statute
said
whoever
wounds
a
federal
officer
as
some
other
federal
statutes
has
done.
and
in
fact,
two
federal
officers
were
wounded,
be
it
by
one
shot
or
several,
there
would
be
two
crimes.
but
congress
has
as
much
right
to
protect
federal
officers
against
assaults,
as
against
wounds.
the
--
the
basic
premise
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
that
this
is
a
statute
which
deals
with
a
crime
of
violence
against
the
person
and
requires
under
the
provision
applicable
in
this
case,
that
there'd
be
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
inflict
bodily
harm
or
to
direct
an
act
of
violence
against
the
person.
and
i
know
of
no
case
in
any
court
in
this
country
where
the
defendant
had
an
intent
to
injure
two
persons,
where
it
has
not
been
held
that
the
unit
of
the
crime
as
each
person
so
injured.
there
is
a
conflict
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
that
is
a
--
a
requirement
of
the
statute
and
that
is
a
specific
allegation
contained
in
the
indictment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
finding
of
--
of
guilty,
i
think,
is
inconclusive
that
the
defendant
had
an
intent
to
assault
each
of
these
officers
on
the
count
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
--
i
agree
that
the
government's
principal
burden
in
this
case
is
to
--
is
to
distinguish
the
bell
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
there
are
two
significant
differences
between
the
bell
case
and
this
case.
in
the
bell
case,
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
federal
government
to
act
was
the
commerce
clause.
absolute
thing
--
crossing
of
--
of
state
lines,
the
federal
government
had
--
had
no
authority.
concerned
as
it
might
be
with
--
with
the
morality
of
the
situation,
it
was
powerless
to
act.
and
there
--
and
the
court
said
therefore,
that
the
unit
of
crime
--
of
the
crime
would
be
the
single
transportation.
there
is
this
other
difference
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
--
that
before
the
rule
of
--
of
lenity
can
be
invoked,
there
--
there
has
to
be
an
ambiguity
in
the
statutes.
in
--
in
other
words,
if
--
if
you
cannot
cease
upon
some
other
possible
unit
of
the
crime,
then
--
then
you
cannot
say
congress
has
spoken
ambiguity.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
if
you
can
look
at
a
statute
as
i
shall
later
suggest,
you
can
look
at
this
statute
and
say
there
is
no
other
reasonable
unit
of
the
crime
that
--
that
we
can
suppose
congress
might
have
intended,
then
i
think
you
have
to
say
and
we
should
properly
say
that
--
that
congress
has
spoken
with
--
with
sufficient
specificity.
we
cannot
reasonably
find
any
other
unit
of
the
crime.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
particularly,
if
i
may,
particularly,
when
you're
dealing
in
the
context
of
a
crime
of
violence
directed
against
the
person
--
a
crime
of
violence
directed
against
the
person,
where
congress
has
used
a
term
which
has
an
accepted
meaning
at
the
common
law,
assault.
and
has
not
otherwise
defined
that
term,
i
think,
you
therefore
look
to
what
--
what
would
constitute
an
assault
at
common
law
and
what
would
be
the
unit
of
--
of
the
crime
at
--
at
common
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
right,
the
governmental
interest
which
--
which
exists
with
respect
to
each
particular
federal
officer.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
the
only
significance
is
that
it
--
it
suggests
another
possibility,
something
else
which
might
be
the
unit
of
the
crime.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
well
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
what
i'm
suggesting,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is,
since
we're
dealing
with
a
crime
of
violence
against
--
against
the
person,
and
in
light
of
the
common
law
background,
the
--
the
most
logical
and
reasonable
unit
of
the
crime
would
be
the
person.
i
go
beyond
that.
i
say
that
you
cannot
read
this
statute
and
--
and
compare
this
with
other
statutes
in
this
court's
construction
of
other
statutes
and
find
in
it,
another
possible
unit
of
the
crime.
and
if
you
can't
find
some
other
possible
unit
of
the
crime,
i
think
then
you
must
say,
“well,
congress
had
specifically,
has
indicated.”
there
can't
be
an
ambiguity
unless
there's
an
alternative.
well,
the
only
other
--
the
only
other
unit
of
the
crime
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
petitioner
is
the
use
of
a
gun.
and
this
construction
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
second
clause
in
the
statute
creates
a
separate
crime.
the
clause
that
reads,
“and
whoever
in
the
commission
of
any
of
the
act
--
i'm
reading
from
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
“and
whoever
in
the
commission
of
any
of
the
acts
described
in
this
section
shall
use
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon,
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000.”
this
is
precisely
parallel
to
other
federal
statutes
to
the
bank
robbery
statutes.
for
example,
in
which
congress
has
--
has
indicated
--
has
defined
a
crime
and
then
has
placed
a
penalty
clause,
an
aggravated
penalty
clause.
this
is
precisely
parallel
to
the
bank
robbery
statute
which
was
before
this
court
in
holiday
against
johnston,
in
313,
united
states.
and
in
that
case,
the
government
conceded
that
the
penalty
provisions
did
not
constitute
a
separate
crime.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
precisely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
--
and
if
the
statute
itself
and
the
other
cases
incidentally
following
holiday
against
johnston,
there
was
a
--
a
many,
many
cases
in
which
defendants
who
have
received
consecutive
sentences
were
resentenced
because
it
was
--
it
was
accepted
that
this
was
not
a
separate
crime.
this
was
merely
a
penalty
provision.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
with
respect
to
this
specific
statutes
referring
to
page
16
of
the
brief
for
the
petitioner,
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
contains
the
following
statements.
“the
second
paragraph
imposes
a
penalty
for
forcibly
resisting,”
and
so
on.
and
then
it
says
“if
a
dangerous
weapon
is
used
in
the
commission
of
any
such
offense,
the
penalty
is
increased.”
there's
not
a
new
crime
created,
the
penalty
is
increased.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
--
i
think
that
poses
a
--
a
much
more
difficult
case.
it
is
certainly
not
the
case
which
is
before
this
court
because
we're
dealing
in
this
case
solely
with
the
other
provision
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
--
that
the
indictment
is
--
in
this
case
is
only
on
the
basis
of
an
assault
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that's
a
clearer
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
you
could
charge
more
than
one.
i
think
you
could
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
don't
think
you
could
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
i
am
reminded,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
the
language
which
mr.
justice
douglas
used
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
universal
c.i.t.
he
said
there,
“of
course,
horrendous
possibilities
can
be
envisioned
--
envisaged
almost
every
law,
but
the
prosecutors
who
enforced
this
act,
the
grand
juries
who
hear
evidence
of
violations
and
the
district
courts
who
applied
these
sanctions
have
to
--
to
date
not
made
these
criminal
provisions
oppressive
and
beyond
reasons.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
prosecutor's
juries
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
--
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
besides
that,
they
--
they
could
in
a
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
in
a
given
factual
situation
of
the
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
would
--
i
would
say
to
this
--
two
points.
one,
i
would
again
emphasize
that
the
statutory
provision
which
is
now
before
this
court
which
is
the
only
provision
which
is
involved
in
the
indictments
in
--
in
this
case,
is
an
assault
on
account
of
the
performance
of
official
duties.
i
think
that
that
--
that's
significant
because
of
the
--
of
the
common
law
background
of
assault.
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
of
course,
our
problem
is
to
determine
what
congress
intended.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
of
course,
the
rule
that
i'm
invoking
is
--
is
the
rule
that
where
congress
uses
a
term
which
has
an
established
common
law
meaning
and
does
not
otherwise
define
that
term,
that
the
meaning
to
be
given
is
that
which
is
recognized
as
the
common
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
--
i
think,
if
that
is
another
basis
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
bell
case
and
the
c.i.t.
cases
because
there,
we
were
dealing
--
this
court
was
dealing
with
--
with
statutory
crimes
which
existed
only
insofar
as
congress
made
them
a
crime.
congress
was
writing
on
--
on
a
blank
page,
so
to
speak,
not
so
here.
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
--
with
a
crime
(inaudible)
in
which
congress
has
used
a
term
recognized
by
the
common
law.
and
it
is
clear,
we
submit,
under
the
common
law
that
where
there
is
an
intent
directed
to
each
of
the
--
of
the
victims
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
statute
now
reads
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i've
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
i
--
my
argument
is
this.
congress
has
used
the
term,
“assault.”
it
is
--
it's
used
other
terms
as
well.
i
would
agree
that
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
--
to
assault,
it
was
probably
the
same
as
that
with
respect
to
the
other
verbs
that
he
used,
which
he
opposes
and
keeps.
i
would
reason
from
that
congress
using
assaults,
using
a
term
which
has
these
established
meanings,
must
have
meant
to
use
that
term,
since
it
didn't
otherwise
define
it.
in
accordance
with
the
meaning
which
it
had
given
--
had
been
given
at
--
at
the
common
law,
so
we
know
when
congress
says,
whoever
forcibly
assaults
as
the
--
as
the
new
statute
now
reads,
that
needs
whoever
does
act,
which
at
the
common
law
reconstitutes
an
assault,
he
shall
be
guilty
--
guilty
of
a
crime.
and
--
and
then,
i
think
that
the
same
reasoning
would
apply
to
the
other
terms
that
congress
used.
but
of
course
there's
--
that
these
are
not
terms
that
are
recognized
by
the
common
law
that
--
that
i
--
i
can't
invoke
that
argument.
i
have
to
reason
from
the
fact
that
congress
first

from
the

--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
yes,
i
--
i
would.
i
think
this
is
an
easier
case,
of
course,
if
that
was
an
assault
case
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
there's
a
specific
requirement
that
the
defendant
has
an
intent
as
to
that
particular
victim.
i
--
and
you
could
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
get
two
ways.
of
course,
you
could
--
you
could
say
as
i
say,
the
government
or
the
congress
says
whoever
saw,
this
is
a
(inaudible)
which
has
been
established.
meaning
--
the
same
meaning
applies
to
the
other
terms.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
the
converse
is
a
--
an
effect
of
an
argument.
it's
the
--
the
new
statute,
of
course,
begins
with
assault
whoever
--
the
new
statute
reads
whoever
forcibly
assaults,
resists,
opposes,
impedes.
the
--
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
these
are
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
don't
--
no,
wasn't
there
--
as
i
--
i
--
a
common
law
concept
of
--
excuse
me,
a
common
law
concept
of
--
of
resistance,
that's
the
fact.
i
--
i
would
suppose
that
it's
--
that
if
there
weren't,
it
--
it
would
be.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
reverse
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
the
contention
which
--
which
the
government
makes
that
there
is
no
other
reasonable
unit
of
the
crime
he
has.
because
i
--
i
agree
that
it
is
not
enough
to
say
well,
congress
would
have
wanted
10
crimes
and
--
and
made
a
hypothetical,
which
--
which
your
honor
suggest,
if
it
didn't
say
so.
i
think
--
i
think
it
has
to
say
so.
i
think
it
has
said
so
here,
because
there
is
no
other
reasonable
alternative.
as
i
said
before,
i
think
before
there
is
an
ambiguity,
there
has
to
be
an
alternative.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
right.
that
--
that
we
can
reason
from
assault
which
is
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
yes,
but
my
--
the
argument
which
i
--
which
i
am
now
advancing
is
not
dependent
upon
the
common
law
and
nature
of
assault.
the
argument
which
i'm
now
advancing
is
dependent
on
the
absence
in
the
statute
of
an
alternative
unit
of
the
crime.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
i
think
congress
had
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
has
--
and
--
and
since
congress
here
has
spoken
of
a
crime
against
the
person,
if
there's
no
other
possible
unit
of
the
crime,
but
the
persons,
can't
we
then
say
congress
has
specifically
enough
indicated
that
the
person
is
to
be
the
unit
of
the
crime.
and
the
only
other
suggested
unit
of
the
crime
is
the
use
of
the
gun.
i
don't
understand
under
that
reasoning
what
the
unit
of
the
crime
would
be
in
the
case
in
which
no
gun
is
used.
suppose
with
your
fist,
you
physically
assault
two
officers.
under
the
reasoning
of
petitioner,
you
would
then
have
two
crimes.
so
that
if
by
your
fist,
you
assault
two
officers
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
you
have
--
you
have
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
may
i,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
just
complete
what
i
started.
if
by
your
fist
you
assault
two
officers
under
petitioner's
reasoning,
there
would
be
two
crimes.
but
if
you
use
a
gun,
then
that's
only
one
crime.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
you
said,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
you
did
not
understand
the
counsel
for
petitioner's
argument
to
be.
that
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
same
as
i
understood
it
to
be.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
suggested
that
the
unit
of
the
crime
was
the
use
of
the
dangerous
weapon
taking,
i
think,
what
is
clearly
the
--
the
penalty
provision
and
making
of
that
the
crime.
and
you
must
then
--
in
the
hypothetical
which
you
--
you're
suggesting
whether
if,
there's
only
one
crime
there,
that
the
unit
i
suppose,
you'd
then
be
saying
that
the
unit
of
the
crime
is
the
entire
transaction.
but
this
is
not
such
--
this
is
not
a
statute
where
congress
has
--
has
used
such
language.
this
is
not
a
statute
which
says
whoever
obstructs
the
--
the
performance
of
government
operations,
whoever
obstructs
the
passage
of
the
mail,
this
is
a
--
a
statute
in
which
congress
has
dealt
with
a
crime
of
violence
against
the
person.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
that
congress
intended
to
protect
each
of
the
officers
against
bodily
assault.
i
think
--
i
think
that
was
the
request
which
was
directed
to
the
congress
to
protect
the
federal
officers
against
assault.
i
think
to
take
a
hypothetical
rather
close
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
hypothetical,
i
think
if
a
defendant
lying
his
victims
up,
if
he
require
that
his
victims
to
stand
directly
next
to
each
other
and
fired
a
shotgun
at
them,
one
pulling
of
the
trigger
and
they
die,
i
think
that
would
be
2
murders.
counsel
for
petitioner
concedes
that
if
the
statute
said
wounds,
whoever
wounds
a
federal
officer
and
that
shotgun
trigger
was
--
was
pulled
once
and
wounded
both
the
officers
that
would
be
two
crimes.
i
think
similarly
because
congress
can't
protect
officers
against
assaults,
as
well
as
against
wounds,
and
against
murder.
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
a
crime
with
respect
to
each
person
towards
whom
the
--
the
defendant
intended
to
direct
a
bodily
injury.
i
think
--
i
think
that
every
case
which
has
dealt
with
an
injury
to
the
person
in
which
there
was
an
intent
to
inflict
injury
to
the
person
has
held
the
unit
of
the
crime
is
the
victim.
i
would
like
straightly
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
procedural
problem
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
it's
a
problem
that
of
diminishing
importance
because
it
--
it
--
that
this
case
was
tried
at
the
time
when
the
federal
law
did
not
acquire
that
there'd
be
a
transcript.
and
there's
a
serious
question
which
has
never
been
decided
by
this
court
whether
you
can
in
a
proceeding
under
2255
challenge
a
--
a
conviction
and
have
a
hearing,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
ascertain
what
the
evidence
was
which
was
introduced
at
the
trial.
in
the
bell
case
or
in
the
prince
case
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
problem
as
to
whether
the
facts
constituted
whether
there
was
one
transportation
or
--
or
several.
this
was
--
this
was
conceded.
but
here,
the
government,
of
course,
cannot
concede
that
there
was
only
--
only
one
shot
fired
of
each
indication
to
the
contrary.
so
petitioner
is
requesting
that
he
be
given
a
hearing
the
purpose
of
which
would
be
to
establish
what
the
testimony
was
that
was
adduced
at
the
trial
which
took
place
some
--
some
13
or
some
years
ago.
and
presumably
that
--
that
testimony
will
be
--
will
be
in
conflict.
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
his
recollection
was,
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
more
than
one
shots
fired.
and
--
and
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
it
somehow
makes
a
difference
how
many
shots
were
fired
even
though
both
counsel
for
petitioner
and
--
and
for
the
government
concede
its
number
of
shots,
you
don't
have
to
fire
the
gun
at
all,
to
constitute
himself.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
if
that
--
if
that
be
the
case,
i
--
i
--
my
impression
was
that
it
took
no
position
that's
left,
but
if
that
be
the
case
--
if
that
is
the
material
factor
whether
the
defendant
was
--
was
a
--
a
good
enough
marksman
and
used
a
--
a
weapon
capable
of
inflicting
multiple
injury
and
was
--
was
a
good
enough
criminal
marksman,
so
that
he
could
--
he
could
wound
these
two
with
--
with
one
act.
if
--
if
that
--
if
that
is
the
issue,
we
question
whether
that
the
purpose
of
a
hearing
under
2255
to
resolve
disputes
at
the
testimony
which
was
introduced
at
the
trial.
now,
clearly
if
--
if
petitioner
had
--
had
taken
an
appeal,
there
would've
been
a
bill
of
exceptions,
there
would
have
been
a
contemporaneous
record
of
what
the
trial
was
--
of
what
the
evidence
at
the
trial
was.
he
complained
of
no
--
of
no
procedural
unfairness
here.
there
was
no
--
there
is
no
suggestion
of
a
violation
of
--
of
any
of
the
procedural
rights.
he
complains
in
essence,
i
suppose,
of
an
instruction
which
the
judge
may
have
engaged
to
the
jury
saying
that
they
could
find
guilt
under
--
under
both
counts
the
evidence
established
only
--
only
one
shot
but
--
but
that
would
be
a
clear
case
of
using
collateral
attack
under
2255
for
the
purposes
of
an
appeal.
we
think
that
--
that
2255
is
not
so
intended
that
you
cannot
use
2255,
the
collateral
attack
with
a
history
which
that
section
had
for
purposes
of
resolving
disputed
fact
issues
at
a
trial,
indeed,
for
purposes
of
attempting
to
establish
what
the
evidence
at
that
trial
was.
this,
relying
on
--
on
cases
such
as
sunal
against
large
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
we
submit
that
--
that
you
cannot
by
2255,
have
a
hearing
to
determine
what
the
evidence
which
was
introduced
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
was.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
as
to
what
the
remedy
(inaudible)
2255
did
not
lie
here,
and
my
answer
is
that
there
would
be
no
judicial
remedy.
the
only
remedy
that
would
be
available
would
be
that
the
executive
clemency
and
since
the
petitioner
is
already
out
on
--
on
parole
that
would
--
that
seemed
--
seemed
very
likely.
in
other
words,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
in
the
same
position
the
government
submits
as
the
defendant
was
in
sunal
against
large
in
332
u.s.
174.
he
had
a
possible
defense
which
he
failed
to
raise
on
--
on
the
appeal
and
he
is
thereafter
precluded
from
raising
it.
the
petitioner
was
represented
at
this
trial
by
privately
retained
counsel.
he
had
a
right
to
an
appeal.
he
did
not
avail
of
himself
of
the
--
of
that
right.
there's
a
concept
that
there
must
be
some
finality
to
direct
review
of
--
of
criminal
judgments
and
that's
a
policy
which
should
be
respected.
and
then
the
district
judge
should
not
be
asked
now
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
what
was
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
at
a
trial
some
13
years
ago
and
to
resolve
disputes
as
to
what
that
evidence
was.
that's
not
a
collateral
attack.
that
--
that's
something
which
--
which
went
to
the
--
to
the
resolution
of
fact
questions
of
the
trial
itself.
that
was
the
jury's
function.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
if
it
makes
--
if
it
makes
no
--
if
it
makes
the
difference
as
to
whether
there
was
one
shot
or
two,
then
i
suppose
that
would
be
the
--
the
issue
at
the
hearing.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
–-
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
whether
there
was
one
shot
or
two.
i
think
you
can
commit
an
assault
without
firing
any
shots.
we
define
and
we
quote
in
our
brief
the
--
the
--
definition
in
the
common
law
in
assault.
it's
an
act
of
force
which
is
directed
at
an
individual
that's
--
the
difference
between
assault
and
battery,
of
course,
is
whether
or
not
there
--
there
has
been
an
impact
and
--
and
you
can
assault
somebody
without
firing
any
shots.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
because
--
i
would
because
in
sunal
against
large,
in
fact,
the
defendant
attempted
to
introduce
the
--
the
defense.
the
trial
judge
precluded
him
erroneously
from
introducing
the
defense
and
despite
that,
and
then
there
was
a
--
a
later
case
which
--
which
would
indicate
that
that
defense
had
been
available
to
him.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
much
easier
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it's
--
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
much
less
harsh
to
preclude
the
defendant
in
this
case
from
collaterally
attacking
the
judgment
than
it
was
in
the
sunal
against
large
in
which
the
defendant
attempted
to
raise
the
defense
and
was
told
by
the
district
judge
that
--
that
the
defense
was
not
available.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
it
has
been
so
clearly
established
in
the
law
that
a
2255
proceeding
cannot
serve
the
function
of
an
appeal.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
would
think
that
one
would
be
bound
by
it
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
involved
no
allegation
of
procedural
unfairness,
where
the
only
--
where
--
where
there
was
not
an
attempt
to
raise
the
defense
and
preclusion
by
the
judge.
whether
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
have
references,
mr.
justice
frunkfurter,
to
cases
which
have
expanded
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
where
there
were
instances
of
procedural
unfairness.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
this
is
the
purest
case
of
a
defendant
who
later
thinks
that
he
had
a
defense
which
he
failed
to
raise
at
the
trial
and
which
he
seeks
to
raise
at
--
at
some
later
day
and
of
course,
the
delay
of
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
--
i
accept
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
--
and
i
say
that
--
that
there
is
a
need
in
the
law
for
finality
of
judgment
and
that
--
that
here
is
an
instance
in
which
the
government
has
clearly
been
prejudiced
by
the
passage
of
time
that
the
court
clerk
is
deceased.
there
is
--
there
are
few
people
available
with
the
contemporaneous
recollection
of
what
the
evidence
was
introduced,
what
the
evidence
that
--
the
present
trial
was.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
evidence
might
show
that,
the
evidence
might
show
that
the
co-defendant,
who
also
had
a
shotgun,
fired
also.
and
of
course,
these
people
have
been
convicted
of
--
of
conspiracy
and
each
is
liable
for
the
acts
of
the
other.
and
so,
there
might
have
been
one
firing
--
the
petitioner
merely
alleged
that
he
fired
only
once
or
he
alleged
something
which
we
now
--
now
construe
that
the
allegation
that
he
fired
once.
but
--
but,
nothing
is
said
about
the
--
the
co-defendant
who
--
the
(inaudible)
alleges
that
--
that
each
uses
loaded
shotguns
in
the
--
the
plural.
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
would
indicate
that
each
defendant
had
a
shotgun.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
what
the
issues
--
if
--
if
a
hearing
were
held,
what
the
issues
would
be.
the
issue
would
be,
assuming
--
assuming
it
to
be
material,
how
many
times
the
defendant
fired
the
shotgun,
whether
the
co-defendant
fired
the
shotgun.
if
there
--
if
there
is
a
conflict
as
to
that
testimony,
as
--
as
--
there's
certainly
will
be,
the
--
the
trial
judge,
i
suppose,
cases
assigned
to
some
other
judge
can
testify
that
his
recollection
is
that
there
was
more
than
one
shot
fired.
but
the
problem
will
be
resolved
in
some
13
years
after
the
trial,
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
once
it's
established
what
--
what
that
evidence
was
and
--
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
anomalous
--
anomalous
proceeding
and
i
think
that
that
would
undercut
the
concept
of
finality
of
--
of
judgment.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
--
i
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
explain
how
it
--
how
it
gets
in
the
record.
we
don't
rely
on
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
apparently,
what
happened
is
that
when
they
were
preparing
--
when
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
was
preparing
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
don't
rely,
we
don't
rely.
the
--
the
only
possible
significance
it
could
have
is
to
establish
the
--
the
point
that
there
will
be
a
dispute
as
to
whether
there
was
one
shot
or
two
and
--
and,
of
course,
the
statement
of
the
trial
judge
and
his
recollection
is
there
was
more
than
one
shot
insufficient.
in
--
in
cases
like
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
would
be
corroborated.
that's
the
whole
point
for
suspending
a
2255
case
back
to
the
trial
judge
because
it's
remanded
is
the
most
familiar
with
the
dispute.
