and
what
is
the
shot
of
the
shotgun?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
is
no
doubt,
as
i
gathered
that
it
was
a
shotgun.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
much
--
and
that
would
settle
the
question
as
to
whether
there
were
numerous
counts
with
the
--
into
this
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
from
a
shotgun?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
i
thought
that
was
true
of
all
shotguns.
now,
i
maybe
wrong
about
that.
i
thought
the
fact
it
was
a
shotgun
means
that
it
--
this
shoots
a
--
fires
a
cartridge
that
is
filled
with
small
lead
pellets.
