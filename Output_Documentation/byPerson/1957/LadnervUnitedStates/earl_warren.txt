chief

you
may
(inaudible)
mr.
sand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
suppose
a
fugitive
ambush
to
whole
posse
of
federal
officers
and
--
and
stood
them
up
with
a
--
with
a
shotgun
at
the
whole
outset.
he
said,
“move
around
here
now
until
i
can
get
away.”
he'd
be
assaulting
every
one
of
them,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
a
shotgun
--
he
had
a
shotgun
and
they
would
put
their
hands
up
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where's
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let's
take
a
machine
gun.
that
--
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
--
would
you
have
as
many
--
as
many
offenses
there
are
in
the
posse
or
if
you
didn't,
is
there
any
place
you
would
have
to
stop
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
order
to
make
this
reasonable
and
enforceable.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
include
in,
a
limitation
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenwald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenwald,
we
--
well
the
court
thanks
you
for
accepting
this
assignment
and
for
the
service
you've
rendered.
it
is
a
real
public
service.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand,
of
course,
we
--
we
express
our
same
appreciation
to
you
for
your
representation
of
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
2,
lovander
ladner,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
rosenwald,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
any
trouble
here,
mr.
rosenwald,
if
--
if
the
defendant
had
been
charged
in
the
first
count
with
resisting
the
officers
by
--
and
using
a
--
a
deadly
weapon
in
one
count
and
then
in
another
count,
they
--
they
charged
him
with
attempt
to
murder,
one
of
the
officers
who
was
--
who
was
actually
shot.
could
we
have
any
trouble
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i'm
getting
at
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this,
mr.
rosenwald.
there
might
--
there
might
be
one
---
just
one
violation
of
this
resistance
to
officers
in
--
in
whatever
he
did,
whether
--
whether
he
fired
one
shot
or
20
shots.
but
in
the
firing
of
those
shots,
he
may
have
committed
other
independent
clients
by
which
he
could've
been
prosecuted
on
this
indictment,
as
well
as
for
resisting
these
officers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
been
charged
under
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
--
that's
all
i
was
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
if
--
if
we
were
to
say
that
--
that
whatever
he
did
in
resisting
these
officers,
that
was
one
crime
of
--
of
resistance.
we
are
not
saying
that
he
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
for
other
crimes
that
he
committed
at
--
at
the
exactly
the
same
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all,
mr.
sand,
there
had
been
10
men
facing
--
10
officers
facing
the
petitioner.
he
resisted
them
and
he
fired
a
shot.
he
missed
everybody.
there's
no
question
about
it
than
what
he's
assaulted
each
one
of
those
--
those
persons.
are
there
10,
as
he
committed
10
violations
of
this
act.
now,
without
regard
to
whether
he's
--
he's
committed
the
separate
crime
of
assault
against
each
of
these
men,
as
he
committed
10
offenses
under
this
particular
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
my
--
my
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
involved
firing
the
shot
in
their
direction.
right
in
their
direction,
as
they
came
--
as
they
came
at
him
to
--
to
arrest
him,
he
fired
the
shots
right
in
--
right
into
them.
miraculously,
he
missed
them
all.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
take
those
facts,
take
those
facts.
those
are
pretty
--
those
are
pretty
simple
facts
aren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
let's
take
the
case
then
of
a
--
throwing
a
hand
grenade
at
them
and
the
hand
grenade
didn't
--
didn't
injure
anyone.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'd
have
10
offenses
under
this
statute
instead
of
one.
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
wonder
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
what's
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
sand,
let
me
get
back
to
the
--
to
the
situation
i
posed
to
you
before.
under
this
statute,
it
is
equally
an
offense
to
forcibly
resist,
oppose,
impede,
intimidate
or
interfere
with
any
person
designated
in
section
253.
now,
let's
take
the
situation
where
10
officers
come
to
a
person's
home
or
establishment
to
execute
some
process
or
to
--
to
arrest
him
or
for
some
other
--
other
purpose.
the
10
people
are
in
front
of
him
and
he
waves
a
gun
at
them
and
he
says,
“you
cannot
come
in
this
house,
any
of
you.
if
you
do,
i
will
kill
you.”
which
is
directed
against
all
10
of
these
people,
he
doesn't
pull
the
trigger,
all
he
does
is
forcibly
resist,
oppose,
impede,
intimidate
and
interfered
with
them.
would
you
say
in
that
situation
that
he
had
committed
10
crimes
because
the
government
said
10
officers
and
that
because
they
sent
10
officers
instead
of
one
that
he
could
be
punished
for
100
years,
instead
of
10
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
you
pointed
to
the
legislative
history
of
it
to
--
to
bring
this
--
make
this
a
general
law
instead
of
having
a
variety
of
laws
which
apply
only
to
--
to
certain
kinds
of
officers.
and
then
each
one
of
those,
i
noticed
according
to
the
letter
of
attorney
general
cummings,
the
word,
“resist”
is
in,
or
“impede”
and
so
forth.
now,
it's
all
in
one
--
it's
all
in
one
paragraph,
all
together.
now,
what
is
there
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
if
he
actually
assaulted
the
officers,
you
could
charge
more
than
one
offense,
but
if
he
only
resisted,
he
impeded
or
interfered
with
them,
that
you
could
only
charge
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
if
my
answer
is
yes,
that
he
--
that
they
--
that
they
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
sentence
him
to
100
years,
if
there
were
10
people
or
if
the
government
only
send
one,
that
they
could
only
send
him
for
10
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
is
that
your
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
just
wanted
to
know
what's
your
point
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
sand
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
isn't
--
isn't
a
resisting
in
the
--
in
the
situations
i
gave
you
exactly
the
same
as
assault
under
--
under
the
common
law,
wasn't
pointing
a
loaded
revolver
at
this
person
an
assault?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
sand,
we'll
take
justice
frankfurter's
situation
and
revise
it
just
(inaudible)
suppose
the
government
sends
10
officers
to
--
to
arrest
the
man
who
-
who's
a
pretty
husky
fellow
and
--
and
they
close
in
on
him
and
he
starts
to
resist
and
he
--
he
just
fights
the
whole
outfit
and
strikes
it
all
of
them
until
they
finally
suppress
him.
would
you
say
that
he
had
committed
10
crimes
and
he
could
be
sent
to
penitentiary
for
30
years
instead
of
just
three
years,
because
there
were
10
men
present
and
he
--
he
struggled
with
them
and
resisted
and
impeded
and
--
and
did
all
the
other
things
that
--
that
the
act
says.
he
assaulted
them
too,
and
would
you
say
that
the
congress
would
intend
that
in
that
situation
that
they
could
charge
10
crimes
against
him
and
convict
him
of
and
sends
him
to
the
penitentiary
for
30
years
instead
of
three?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
this
affidavit
get
into
the
record,
mr.
sands?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
don't
rely
on
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
corroborated
with
the
judge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
corroborated
with
the
judge's
recollection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
rosenwald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenwald,
before
you
be
seated,
i
--
i
want
to
repeat
to
you
what
i
--
what
i
said
to
counsel
who
preceded
you,
mr.
fisher.
we
--
we
do
appreciate
your
--
your
representation
of
this
indigent
defendant
at
our
--
our
request.
you've
been
here
twice
also.
it
will
be
the
last
time
on
this
--
on
this
case,
but
it
does
give
us
comfort
to
know
that
man
of
--
men
of
the
bar
will
do
which
you
have
done
in
this
matter
for
us.
and
thank
you,
mr.
sand
for
--
for
your
helpfulness,
same
language
that
i
expressed
to
mr.
weines.
