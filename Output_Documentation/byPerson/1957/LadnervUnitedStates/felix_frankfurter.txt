but
the
statute
--
the
statute
seems
to
imply
distributed
use
of
the
various
--
some
position
that
you
may.
then
--
then
whoever
in
the
commission
of
any
of
the
act
described
therefore
different
acts
may
have
different
consequences
or
be
committed
in
the
different
contexts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
if
he
takes
your
cloth
and
hits
successively
two
agents
down
the
head,
in
your
view,
is
that
one
act
or
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
gathered
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
gathered
from
your
argument
that
since
mass
consequences
of
a
single
impulse
or
act,
only
is
the
--
a
constitutional
commission
of
only
one
offense
as
to
some
aspects
of
the
various
conducts
proscribed
by
this
statute.
therefore,
the
face
of
the
statute
indicates
that
a
single
such
impulsion
means
--
can
mean
only
one
single
offense.
wasn't
that
the
tenor
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
have
to
--
if
you
don't
charge
that,
the
consequence
defined
by
the
statute
doesn't
follow
and
if
you
do
charge
it,
you
must
prove
it
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
simply
--
simply
you
can
--
you
can't
--
you
can't
get
that
penalty,
you
can't
invoke
that
penalty
unless
you
make
it
part
of
the
offense.
that
--
i
don't
see
what
--
what
cash
you're
getting
out
of
that
argument,
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
so,
which
this
fellow
is
convicted
is
the
first
and
second
clause
not
to
be
sentenced
upon
and
that's
what
the
government
proved
and
that's
what
it
stands
out,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix

with
a
deadly
weapon.
justice
felix

all
right.
justice

are
you
suggesting
that
they

it

would
be

i
should
think
in

is
that
a
one
then

i
should
think
that
applies
to
the

justice

he's
not
distributively

is
he?
justice

what
kind
of
guidance
are
you
giving
the

in
order
to
decide
in
public
possibilities?
justice
felix

your
--
you're
--
at
this
point
you're
arguing
that
is
the
nature
of
the
offense
that
congress
has
outlawed
by
the
terms
of
the
interdiction,
is
that
it?
justice
felix

and
on
that
basis
it's
like
the
cohabitation

and
with
that
goes
a
(inaudible)
cohabitation
doesn't
mean
the
possession
of

but
means
the
continuity
of

i'm
not

you're
not

down
as

that's
not

it?

a

in
criminal

may
i
(inaudible)
what
--
what
development
is
that,
that
the
constitutional
basis
was
crossing
of

lines?
once
you
have
a

the

which

draws
from

is
of
no

justice

but
why
--
why
is
the

--
why
is
the
united
--
why
is
the
congress
interested
in
making
an
assault
on
these
things,
a
federal
offense
and
not
leaving
it
to
the

statute,
because
of
the
governmental
interest?
justice

yes,
that's
right.
and
it
doesn't
mean
--
but
the
transaction,
i
mean
the
--
all
i'm
was
suggesting
is
that
i
see
no
difference
between
the
source
of
the
power
of
the
legislation
as
a
basis
of
arguing
whether
congress
has
indicated
when

has

of
a
consequence,
you
should
have
multiple

in

count

in

justice

according
to
this,
that
the

is
there
is
such
a
thing
as
you
call
a
rule
of
lenity.
and
as

if

haven't

there
then

that

to
offer

this

that's

is
when
a

does

if
it

if

is

if
it
isn't,
then
i'm
just
guessing
and
imputing
an

which
didn't
exist.

don't

use

i
--
justice

from
your
point

am
i
correct?
justice

(voice

--
justice
felix

mr.
sand,
you
suppose
that
congress
had
been
asked
--
had
been
this
forethought
wouldn't
it?
well
that's
in
the
congress.
don't
you
suppose
they
would've
said,
sure
it's
a
different
--
it
makes
a
difference
to
us,
whether
as
a
matter
of
liaison,
you
think
a
young
woman
across
the
north
river,
jersey
or
from
jersey.
i
want
a
specific
place
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
because
that's
on
the
other
side
of
the
northwest
or
wouldn't
they've
make
a
difference
between
that
kind
of
a
case
and
taking
10
women
as
a
professional
finder
of
cause.
and
yet
i
don't
understand
the
bell
case,
calls
to
find
out
to
make
such
moralistic
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
justice
brennan's
question
to
you,
to
which
you
responded
logically,
but
i
think
the
subject
is
from
your
point
of
view
that
assault
might
be
just
one
unit.
and
if
you
think
that
owns
a
resist
and
oppose,
which
do
not
carry
those
common
law
issues,
is
the
certiorari
unit,
gets
the
color
from
the
fact
that
assault
being
a
common
law
single
unit,
the
others
derive
that
color
from
the
fact
although,
they're
not
common
law
units,
but
assault
of
the
common
law
unit.
that's
what
your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
i
would
presumably
meant
to
have
the
same
consequences
follow,
if
this
contention
will
resolve
intentions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
difficult
is
that
you're
confronting
two
things,
namely,
what
is
the
unit
of
crime
and
two,
what
should
be
deemed
to
be
the
penalizing
consequences
even
though
you
permit
10
units.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
they're
two
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
depends
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
understand
his
argument.
suppose
--
suppose
a
man
was
sent
over
some
strong
man
of
the
day
whether
to
stand
on
the
circuit,
one
case,
one
deputy
marshal
and
10
of
them
are
in
a
row
like
dominoes
and
they
all
go
over.
why
do
i
have
to
bother
what
the
unit
of
the
offense
is
in
determining
whether
that
should
be
punished
or
whether
that
the
three
isn't
got
to
a
30
years,
that's
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
could
have
written
out
and
said,
if
by
a
single
act
--
if
by
a
single
act
although
10
people
or
three
people
or
five
people
are
adversely
and
violently
affected
nevertheless,
only
a
single
punishment
could
be
given.
congress
could
do
that,
now,
what
i
understand
the
rule
of
lenity
to
be
that
they
construe
it
to
be
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
one
and
on
the
nine
other
deputy
marshals
behind
him
and
they
all
topple
over
like
dominoes.
i
didn't
understand
that
you
almost
suggest
that
was
the
10
crimes.
and
that
(inaudible)
it's
only
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
agree
--
i
agree
with
your
(inaudible)
suppose
in
my
case
they're
toppling
over
10
fellows,
then
that
is
(inaudible)
the
prosecutors
would
lay
the
indictment
by
charging
the
crime
as
against
any
one
of
the
10.
so
that
on
your
point
of
view,
i
have
no
difficulty
in
saying
there
were
10,
this
unit
of
offense
in
the
violence
committed
upon
each
one
of
the
humans,
but
the
problem
of
what
the
consequence
is
if
you
have
a
single
impulsive
act,
it's
a
totally
different
part.
and
that's
the
question
of
how
we
are
to
conclude
the
penal
part
of
the
statute
and
then
their
difference
--
two
different
problems
in
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
he
would
--
instead
of
making
a
difference
on
the
line
(inaudible)
that
you've
given,
if
that
was
deemed
to
be
the
missing
deemed
to
be
the
annunciation
of
a
new
doctrine
that
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
assumption
that
at
the
time
--
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
time
when
you
said
he
should
have
--
it
should
--
the
question
should've
been
raised
by
then
counsel
if
the
assumption
was
it
was
more
than
one
offense
and
that
then
introduced
the
new
rule,
the
instruction
of
capital
punishment,
you
would
say
that
makes
no
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
it's
a
lot
easier
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
would
you
say
that
the
problem
as
to
the
scope
of
the
habeas
corpus
writ
sufficiently
like
a
reconsideration
of
the
constitutional
question
that
they
didn't
want
to
expect
precedence
to
feel
that
that's
open?
did
they
have
bound
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
acceptance
of
powers
that
could've
been
bound
by
any
kind
of
question
actually?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
follow
it.
that
is
in
generality.
i
didn't
(inaudible)
to
know
and
i
normally
in
more
than
other
cases
like
to
reconsider
a
case,
that
happens
to
same
as
the
sentence.
when
we
deal
with
habeas
corpus,
we're
dealing
with
something
close
to
the
constitutional
rights
that
i
would
like
to
have
the
government's
view
to
find
your
position
given
in
consideration
of
the
decision
such
as
in
sunal
and
large
is
a
result
of
the
habeas
corpus.
whether
you
think
that
decision
is
close
to
the
problem
with
the
constitutionality
and
bill
of
rights,
one
would
feel
less
rigidly
bound
by
the

of
both,
could
raise
the
question
and

because

thought
with
some
justification
or
the

of
justification

the
time

didn't
have
a

you
call
a

you
brought
it
up
on

suppose
in

that
you're
taking
this
question
of
it
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
an

(inaudible)
justice

then,
does
that
mean
that
he
can
raise
the
question
of
excessive
sentence
either
by
the
ordinary
process
of
appeal
or
not
appeal
and
bring
him
under
2255?

that

that's
followed,
isn't
it?
