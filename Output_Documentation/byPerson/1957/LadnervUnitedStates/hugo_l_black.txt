suppose
there
were
10
officers
that
sometimes
they
go
in
a
team
and
one
man,
(inaudible)
they
were
all
together
and
he
grabbed
one
of
them
and
resisted
him.
could
he
be
tried
then
for
10
different
offenses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
he's
resist
them,
all
--
all
were
together.
would
he
have
to
shake
each
one
of
them
separately
it
says,
who
shall
forcibly
resist,
oppose,
impede
and
attempt,
intimidate
and
all
of
these.
suppose
he
just
ran
from
them.
he'd
impede
them.
justice
hugo

but
that's
quickly
as
broad,
if
you
will
put
in
the
test
results.
justice
hugo
l.

there
wouldn't
be
any
difference
within
and
the
three
if
--
if
there's
10
officers
there,
your
rule
would
apply,
i
suppose,
just
the
same
whether
it's
on
a
one
clause
or
the
other,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
resistance,
or
opposition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
would
get
out
of
there,
he'd
certainly
be
found
to
resist
them
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
might
not
see
them
all
but
if
he's
trying
to
impede
them
by
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
officially
done.
i'm
just
thinking
about
the
construction
of
the
statute.
i
would
think
if
--
if
we
couldn't
construe
the
(inaudible)
differently,
could
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
it,
wouldn't
he?
