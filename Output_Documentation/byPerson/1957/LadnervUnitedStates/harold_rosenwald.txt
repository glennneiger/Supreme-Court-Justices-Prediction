mr.
harold
rosenwald
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
there
was
an
indictment
in
three
counts
under
section
254
of
former
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
first
count
charged
to
the
petitioner
with
conspiring
with
another
person
named
cameron
to
violate
section
254
by
means
--
by
conspiring
by
means
of
deadly
and
dangerous
weapons
to
assault
two
agents
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
of
the
treasury
department.
the
second
count
alleged
that
at
the
same
time
and
place,
the
petitioner
and
cameron
actually
did
assault
one
such
agent
named
reed
and
used
--
assaulted
him
by
the
use
of
a
deadly
and
dangerous
weapon
to
wit,
a
--
a
loaded
shotgun.
the
third
count
charged
a
--
a
similar
assault
with
loaded
shotgun
against
a
second
alcohol
tax
unit
agent
named
frost.
the
second
count
stated
that
the
federal
agent
who
is
the
victim
of
the
assault
was
seriously
wounded.
the
third
count
simply
alleged
that
the
federal
agent
there
involved
was
wounded.
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
rather,
was
arraigned,
placed
on
trial
in
the
district
court
in
mississippi
and
pleaded
not
guilty.
he
was
found
guilty
by
the
jury
on
all
the
three
counts.
and
on
the
same
day,
he
was
sentenced
to
two
years
on
the
first
count
to
be
concurrent
with
the
sentence
on
the
second
count
for
ten
years
on
the
second
count
and
the
ten
years
on
the
third
count
was
sentences
under
the
second
and
third
count
to
be
consecutive
or
a
total
of
20
years.
there
was
no
transcript
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial,
whatsoever.
there
was
no
appeal
taken
from
the
conviction
at
that
time.
there
is
nothing
of
evidence
in
this
record
before
the
court.
there
is,
that
crept
into
the
record
someway,
an
affidavit
taken
before
a
credible
investigative
agents,
which
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
in
evidence
in
the
trial
it
shouldn't
have
been
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
having
any
value
bearing
on
this
case.
in
the
--
after
serving
more
than
ten
years,
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
under
section
2255
of
title
28
to
correct
this
sentence.
this
motion
was
filed
on
january
22
of
1955.
a
--
a
motion
alleged
that
the
sentences
under
the
--
that
the
offenses
charged
in
the
second
and
third
counts
were
only
a
single
offense,
and
therefore
the
sentences
under
those
two
counts
should
not
have
been
consecutive.
the
motion
doesn't
clearly
state
but
it
surely
implies,
that
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
the
--
a
gun
was
used
but
was
only
fired
once.
and
apparently
it
is
claimed
that
the
--
this
was
a
shotgun
with
pellets
scattered
and
the
one
shot
struck
the
two
federal
agents.
the
motion
of
the
petitioner
was
denied
by
district
judge
mize
on
the
grounds,
stressed
that
he
had
a
personal
recollection
of
more
than
one
shoppers-by
although
the
crowd
that
it
occurred
more
than
ten
years
prior
to
that
time.
it
made
that
there
is
no
transcript
taken.
and
he
said
that
in
any
event,
each
count
of
the
indictment
alleged
the
separate
offense
meaning
the
second
and
third
count
alleged
separate
offenses
because
separate
victims
of
the
shot
were
named.
he
also
made
a
statement
that
the
motion
had
been
denied
on
a
prior
occasion
and
cited
as
his
authority
to
that
statement,
his
own
decision
overruling
such
a
motion
filed
by
the
petitioner's
co-defendant
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
petitioner
himself
had
never
filed
a
motion
to
before
it.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
heard
the
appeal
that
was
filed
by
the
petitioner.
he
proceeded
in
the
form
of
progress
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
judge,
rejected
the
recollection
of
the
district
judge
as
having
any
bearing
on
the
question,
found
no
evidence
in
the
record
worthy
of
consideration
by
the
court
that
there
was
more
one
shot
fired
and
treated
the
case
on
the
basis
that
the
motion
of
the
petitioner
clearly
stated
that
one
shot
and
one
shot
alone
was
fired
and
that
that
one
shot
resulted
in
the
wounding
of
these
two
federal
agents.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
one
shot
striking
the
two
men
constituted
two
offenses
under
section
254.
and
this
court
granted
certiorari,
and
the
case
is
here
as
we
submit
on
that
narrow
question
whether
a
single
shot
of
a
shotgun
which
strikes
two
men
can
constitute
more
than
one
offense
under
section
254.
the
government
has
stated
the
question
quite
differently
and
we
are
in
complete
disagreement
with
the
statement
of
the
question
as
it's
presented.
government
statement
should
be
a
shot
was
fired
on
the
same
day.
there
are
two
federal
agents
wounded
on
the
same
day
or
some
safe
language
and
to
ignore
the
critical
question
in
the
case
which
is
whether
the
single
discharge
of
a
shotgun
can
constitute
more
than
one
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
think
it
may
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
--
it
may
make
a
difference
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
he
has
a
repeating
gun
or
machine
gun
that
requires
only
a
single
impulse
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
the
phrase
in
the
recent
case
then
it
might
well
be
that
that
would
only
constitute
one
offense.
it's
clearly
versus
the
strongest
case
we
can
have.
there
is
only
one
--
one
shot
--
and
i
would
incredibly
put
the
case
on
that
narrow
ground.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
stand
corrected,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
one
discharge
of
the
shotgun
and
a
number
of
bullets,
pellets
or
whatever
is
in
the
--
attracted
to
it,
using
a
shotgun
scattered
and
struck
two
people.
now,
in
this
case,
unlike
the
two
preceding
cases,
we
don't
know
delicate
problems
of
state
and
federal
relations.
nor
do
we
have
is
like
to
see
the
matter
any
constitutional
questions
where
it
come
here
with
a
simple
matter
construing
a
statute
of
united
states
congress.
the
statute
has
two
clauses.
the
first
clause
makes
it
an
offense
to
forcibly
resist,
oppose,
impede,
intimidate,
or
interfere
with
certain
designated
federal
officials
referred
in
the
prior
section
of
the
code
or
to
assault
any
such
official
on
account
of
his
official
duties.
there
are
six
things
that
are
forbidden.
the
second
clause
of
the
statute
proscribes
the
use
of
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
in
the
commission
of
any
of
the
six
forbidden
acts
mentioned
in
the
first
clause
of
the
statute
and
prescribes
a
10-year
penalty
for
violation
where
the
dangerous
weapon
is
used
and
there
are
three
years
under
the
first
clause.
now,
i
think
we
can
almost
dispose
of
this
case
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself
without
going
beyond
it
or
any
extraneous
resistance.
the
government
argues
and
the
two
courts
below
seem
to
hold
that
this
case
--
that
this
statute
condemned
an
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon.
they
completely
ignored
the
other
things
forbidden
by
the
statute.
now,
we
have
to
test
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
against
this
statute
as
a
whole,
resistance
opposing,
impeding,
suppose
that
the
present
forcefully
holds
the
door
against
six
federal
agents
who
were
attempting
to
enter
a
room
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
that
this
court
say
or
where
the
court
below
had
said
under
those
circumstances,
that
there
were
six
separate
violations
of
the
statue
or
i
suppose
that
instead
of
using
a
simple
force
in
case
of
arms,
the
petitioner
here
could
wave
the
clock
or
the
butt
of
a
gun
in
other
words
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon,
of
course,
make
it
a
knife
as
long
as
it's
deadly
and
dangerous.
and
he
didn't
point
it
at
anybody,
he
didn't
stab
or
strike
anybody
with
this
weapon,
but
he
certainly
resisted
and
opposed
and
perhaps
added
a
few
threats.
and
in
such
a
case
if
there
were
ten
agents,
would
there
be
ten
violations
of
the
statute?
would
the
man
be
properly
sentenced
for
ten
years
for
each
agent
who
was
affected
by
his
unlawful
act,
perfectly
willing
to
agree
with
the
--
would
have
violated
the
statute
for
how
many
times.
once
for
each
agent
affected
by
what
he
did?
now
in
this
case
on
the
face
of
the
statute
when
the
petitioner
held
his
shotgun
and
before
he
fired,
he's
violated
the
statute.
he
committed
an
assault
and
pointed
at
them,
i
assume
they
knew
what
was
happening.
but
in
any
event,
he
pointed
it
at
them,
he
made
ready
to
fire,
and
his
offenses
should
make
this
complete
then
and
there.
he
violated
the
statute.
what
happened
to
those
bullets
if
they
hit
two
federal
agents
with
a
stick,
of
if
they
hadn't
hit
any
of
them,
he's
violated
the
statute.
but
i
don't
think
he
violated
at
more
than
once
because
the
statute
says
it
should
be
upon
the
use
of
a
dangerous
or
deadly
weapon
and
he
used
it
and
that
he
might,
it
seems
to
me
clear
from
the
face
which
said
to
himself
was
the
unit
of
prosecution
in
this
case.
the
use
of
the
gun
in
whatever
way
may
have
been
used.
consequently
to,
it's
not
material.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
the
statute
--
that
that's
true.
the
statute
permits
the
offense
to
be
committed
even
without
doing
anything,
it
does
any
harm.
i
mean
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
in
my
view,
that's
clearly
two
acts,
whether
it's
two
offenses
depends
on
another
question
which
isn't
raised
in
the
same
question
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
--
existed.
is
this
really
one
transaction
or
two
transactions?
we
are
--
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
there's
only
one
act.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
that's
the
tenor
of
my
argument,
one
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
the
consequences
or
the
effect
or
result
of
what
the
petitioner
did
has
no
bearing
on
the
measurement
of
his
crime.
the
crime
was
completed
when
he
did
the
act
which
is
forbidden
and
that
was
a
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
and
once
he
did
that,
we
don't
follow
the
bullets
through
the
air
to
find
what
they
struck
if
anything,
because
it's
not
material.
this
violated
the
statute
and
that's
the
end
of
it
once
he
did
that
act.
since,
there
was,
as
i
say,
only
one
single
act.
what
the
--
there
is
such
raised
also
in
this
case
the
question
that's
been
before
this
court
several
times
in
the
last
couples
of
years
of
the
construction
of
a
statute
which
is
not
clear
and
for
this
purpose
i'm
willing
to
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
government's
position,
the
position
of
the
courts
below
is
correct.
that
this
statute
simply
said
whoever
resorts
to
the
dangerous
weapon
and
we
will
assume
that
here
you
may
take
into
account
the
consequences
or
at
least
notice
it
could
be
good
(inaudible).
in
such
cases,
similar
cases,
this
court
has
stated
several
times
that
whether
or
not
multiple
punishments
were
intended
to
the
--
to
be
imposed
or
may
be
imposed
with
the
consequences
of
a
single
criminal
act,
depends
upon
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
adopting
the
statute.
and
in
determining
there
the
intention
we
look
at
such,
helplessly
find
or
may
find
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
the
logic
--
logical
problem
is
too
difficult.
it
leads
us
to
frequently,
to
an
impasse.
and
whether
one
blow
constitutes
two
more
offenses
under
the
common
law,
whether
one
shot
that
strikes
two
people
is
one
murder
or
two
murders
is
a
matter
that's
been
the
subject
of
philosophical
consideration
where
the
courts
(inaudible)
and
it
leads
into
a
great
quagmire
of
logical
difficulties
and
fine
distinctions
that
this
court
has
supported
completely
in
such
cases
as
bell
against
united
states
and
prince
against
united
states
and
the
c.i.t.
credit
corporation
case
and
has
held
that
this
is
really
a
question
of
what
congress
intended
and
the
look
--
the
primary
intention
and
if
there
is
no
clearly
stated
intention
to
impose
multiple
punishment
for
a
single
criminal
act
then
we
resolve
the
doubts
in
favor
of
the
criminal
defendant.
now,
we
have
examined
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
section
254.
it's
interesting
but
not
very
illuminating.
the
statute
was
introduced
at
the
request
of
the
department
of
justice,
and
in
1934,
there
was
a
letter
of
the
attorney
general
to
both
chairman
of
the
house
and
senate
committees
and
the
judiciary
respectively
which
is
set
forth
--
and
that
is
set
forth
in
full
in
my
brief.
and
in
that
letter,
the
attorney
general
requested
that
the
congress
adopt
general
legislation
to
protect
federal
agents
and
he
cited
specific
statutes
already
in
existence,
one
of
which
made
it
an
offense
to
wound
the
federal
officer.
from
this,
we
argue
that
the
congress
said
before
it
a
suggestion
at
least
or
at
least
it
was
called
to
their
attention
that
they
might
make
an
offense
to
wound
the
federal
officer,
and
thereby,
the
consequences
of
the
act
condemned
would
be
more
significant
than
they
are
here
but
that,
nevertheless,
that
course
was
empowered.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
about
wounding.
the
statute
reads
simply
as
it
reads.
now,
at
--
there's
very
little
more
the
debates
in
--
in
the
congress
are
not
very
helpful.
the
--
there
was
a
committee
report
referred
to
in
my
brief.
it
does
nothing
more
than
paraphrase
the
statute
as
it
was
firmly
written.
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
--
is
frankly
helpful
but
i
can't
--
to
say
it's
overwhelmingly
imposed
that
congress
had
any
specific
intention
in
the
matter
before
the
court.
now,
of
course,
in
these
cases
when
statutes
of
this
kind
are
under
consideration
by
the
congress,
nobody
really
says,
“well,
now
suppose
if
somebody
shoots
a
shotgun
and
hits
two
people
with
the
same
shot,
and
this
have
no
such
specific
help
in
this
case
and
that
the
same
suggestion
that
there
was
no
intention,
at
least
to
deal
with
the
consequences
of
the
condemned
act.
now
--
but
in
the
prince
case,
it
was
probably
more
helpful
legislative
history
but
the
rule
stated
in
both
prince
and
bell
is
that
unless
the
legislative
history,
as
i
read
those
cases,
unless
the
legislative
history
shows
an
intention
to
impose
multiple
punishments,
the
court
will
not
impute
that
intention
to
congress
because
there
would
be
penalties
are
too
harsh
and
i
cited
a
number
of
cases
where
multiple
punishments
were
imposed
in
my
brief.
it
shows
just
how
harsh
they
can,
they
can
be
terrific.
i
did
refer
in
the
brief
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
111
of
--
under
the
1948
revision
of
the
criminal
statutes,
title
18,
section
254
involved
in
this
case
and
section
118
of
former
title
18
were
combined
to
form
this
new
section
111
of
title
18
which
covers
the
ground
at
the
present
time.
and
that
this
section
118
that
was
combined
with
254
i
trace
back
to
the
criminal
code
of
1909
and
to
the
original
connecting
of
that
statute
in
1905.
that
statute
for
which
and
was
specific
statute
to
--
to
254
and
covered
only
employees
of
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
and
in
its
original
version,
that
statute
provided
that
it
was
an
offense
to
discharge
any
deadly
weapon
at
any
officer
or
employee
of
the
bureau
of
animal
industry
or
to
use
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
in
resisting
them.
and
the
offense
was
clearly
defined
in
that
statute
as
discharging
any
weapon.
in
other
words,
the
offense
was
done
when
the
weapon
was
discharged,
that
was
when
the
consequences
were
not
material.
i
submit
that
that
statute
suddenly
goes
where
it's
about
discharging
a
deadly
weapon
were
dropped
when
the
statute
was
included
in
the
1909
criminal
code.
and
i
suggest
in
my
brief
that
the
reasons
for
the
omission
is
that
the
words
were
considered
redundant
and
really
covered
by
the
words
“the
use
of
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon”
that
the
two
statutes
section
250
--
no
that
we
can
and
therefore
infer
that
it
was
understood
by
congress
in
adopting
the
criminal
code
of
1909,
but
the
statute
meant
what
it
originally
said
that
it's
the
use
of
the
weapon
or
the
discharge
of
the
weapon
that
was
condemned,
that
the
consequences
were
not
material
and
you
didn't
look
to
them
and
this
statute
being
combined
with
254,
the
two
of
them
should
be
construed
in
the
same
way
and
therefore,
254
means
just
what
118
meant,
and
the
offense
is
simply
the
use
of
the
dangerous
weapon
without
regard
to
the
consequences.
i've
been
discouraged
by
the
statements
of
this
court
in
the
prince
case
and
in
the
bell
case
not
to
refer
to
cases
decided
under
other
statutes
and
yet
it
seems
that
this
is
always
done
so
i
could
mention
just
a
few
of
them.
the
leading
one,
i
think,
is
the
bell
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
transportation
of
two
women
at
the
same
time
in
interstate
commerce,
in
the
same
vehicle
and
on
the
same
occasion
for
immoral
purposes
constituted
only
one
violation
of
the
mann
act,
that
we
don't
count
the
number
of
victims
of
the
unlawful
conduct,
that
the
deed
is
single
and
the
offense
is
single.
the
government
used
that
the
words
in
this
statute
before
the
court
was
singular
whoever
assaults
any
person.
they
were
just
as
singular
in
the
bell
case,
the
words
in
the
mann
act,
“whoever
transports
any
woman
--
any
woman
or
girl”,
it
is
customary
in
statutes
to
use
single
language
of
--
of
--
in
the
singular,
and
that
was
not
so
controlling
in
the
bell
case.
the
bank
robbery
cases
have
some
relevancy,
i
think.
this
court
held
in
the
prince
case
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
make
it
a
separate
offense
to
enter
a
bank
and
the
felonious
purposes
and
also
separate
offense
to
consummate
the
purpose
by
robbing
the
bank.
that
was
all
part
of
the
same
criminal
transaction
and
only
one
offense
or
the
statute
was
meant
to
cover
alternatives
and
view
the
prosecutor
in
court
pick
the
alternative.
we're
not
dealing,
of
course,
in
anyway
with
the
validity
of
the
indictment
here.
an
indictment
was
all
right.
the
trial
was
all
right.
the
question
comes
up
on
a
matter
of
sentence.
the
prosecutor
could
frame
his
charge
in
a
variety
of
ways,
in
the
alternative
in
effect
would
provide
for
the
exigencies
of
proof.
but
the
question
is
how
many
offenses
after
all
the
evidence
is
in,
how
many
offenses
were
committed?
the
bank
robbery
cases
which
have
a
real
bearing
on
this
case
are
two
decisions,
lockhart
against
united
states
and
dimenza
against
johnston
decided
by
the
courts
of
appeals,
i
think
in
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuits.
and
dealing
with
the
clause
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
that
makes
it
an
offense
in
the
process
of
robbering
--
robbing
a
bank
to
put
in
jeopardy
the
life
of
any
person
and
when
the
bank
robber
robs
a
bank
with
an
armed
--
with
--
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
puts
in
jeopardy
the
life
of
any
person,
that
is
a
25-year
offense
under
the
bank
robbery
statute.
but
if
he
puts
in
jeopardy
the
life
of
several
persons,
it
is
not
under
these
two
cases
more
than
one
offense.
now,
i
think
that
those
cases
have
--
have
a
very
important
bearing
on
the
case
we
have
here
because
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
if
petitioner
had
merely
threatened
with
the
use
of
a
gun
several
federal
agents,
he
would
have
been
in
almost
exactly
the
position
of
the
man
in
these
two
cases
who
walked
into
the
bank
that
committed
a
robbery
and
put
in
jeopardy
the
life
of
more
than
one
person
and
that
in
these
two
were
recent
cases
is
held
to
constitute
only
a
single
offense.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
lockhart
against
united
states,
dimenza
and
versus
johnston,
both
of
which,
mr.
justice
harlan,
are
cited
in
my
brief.
the
mail
bag
cases
start
with
the
important
decision
of
ebeling
against
morgan.
ebeling
against
morgan
held
that
it
was
a
separate
offense
to
cut
each
mail
bag
where
they
were
all
cut
at
the
same
time
under
a
statute
making
it
an
offense
to
cut
any
mail
bag
with
the
intention
of
stealing
the
contents.
ebeling
against
morgan
is
a
rather
harsh
case.
there
they
were
to
be
sure
a
successive
act
and
the
case
that
mr.
justice
harlan
put
to
me
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
is
answered
perhaps
by
ebeling
against
morgan
answers
of
the
day
of
their
decision.
there
the
man
probably
--
well,
apparently
went
through
the
night
and
cut
the
bags
immediately
one
after
the
other.
and
one
might
think
that
that
was
one
criminal
transaction
and
only
one
violation
of
the
statute
and
which
went
for
the
authority
of
that
case.
but
it
is
a
rather
an
old
case,
and
i
think
it's
somewhat
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
later
cases
if
the
court
which
has
decided.
and
i
would
like
to
see
it
overruled.
in
effort
to
escape
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
kerr
against
squier
held
on
to
another
clause
of
the
same
statute
and
it
was
only
one
offense
to
steal
three
mail
bags
at
the
same
time
and
made
the
very
unconvincing
distinction
that
you
could
steal
three
mail
bags
at
the
same
time
but
you
--
but
to
cut
them
you
had
to
make
separate
motions.
well,
i
had
seen
some
of
these
mail
bags
and
i
don't
think
i
could
let
three
of
them
at
the
same
time.
i
think
that
would
be
even
hard
in
cutting
three
of
them.
it's
certainly
more
of
muscular
effort,
but
the
case
is
very
easily
explained.
somehow,
ebeling
against
morgan
seems
a
little
too
tough
to
follow
and
so
they
made
a
distinction
which
is
not
very
convincing.
the
common
law
doctrines
are
much
less
helpful
than
the
cases
under
other
federal
statute
because
they
don't
help
us
in
determining
what
the
intention
of
congress
was
in
enacting
this
statute.
and
nevertheless,
in
addition
to
that,
the
common
law
cases
were
in
great
conflict.
i
do
believe
that
the
simple
type
of
situation
where
a
person
fires
a
gun
and
strikes
two
persons
with
it,
that
the
majority
rule
would
hold
that
that
is
indeed
two
separate
offenses,
but
there
is
authority
tot
the
contrary.
on
the
other
hand,
where
there
is
negligent
homicide,
the
automobile
cases
the
majority
rule,
quite
inconsistently
it
seems
to
be
that,
there
is
only
one
offense
if
someone
operates
an
automobile
with
--
in
a
criminal
way
and
kills
more
than
one
people
that
is
only
one
offense
under
the
majority
rule.
the
government
has
cited
the
minority
decisions
and
doesn't
mention
the
majority
decisions
in
--
in
the
government's
brief.we
wouldn't
know
if
that
is
the
minority
rule.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
just
want
to
deal
with
the
government's
last
point
which
isn't
conceded
in
my
brief.
i
made
a
statement
in
the
brief
which
is
quite
--
was
a
frivolous
act.
i
--
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
validity
at
all.
that
this
section
2255
motions
the
court
has
considered
repeatedly
or
excessively
sentences
have
been
imposed
and
in
all
of
those
cases
the
question
could
have
been
raised
on
appeal.
and
it
is
the
--
my
brief
cites
a
considerable
number
of
cases
both
in
this
court
including
the
prince
case
last
term
and
the
bell
case
itself
where
the
question
of
an
excessive
sentence
was
raised
on
a
motion
under
2255,
(inaudible)
which
was
--
to
reach
an
effort
to
review
on
habeas
corpus
the
question
whether
the
petitioner
was
guilty
of
the
offense.
there
is
no
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
involved
here.
we're
attacking
only
the
sentence.
the
petitioner
was
guilty,
we
have
held
question
about
it.
that
the
--
the
cases
in
my
brief
where
the
matter
was
raised
to
--
on
--
on
actually
on
habeas
corpus
in
morgan
against
devine
and
johnston
against
lagomarsino,
dimenza
against
johnston,
kerr
against
squier,
under
2255
united
states
against
hayman,
the
prince
and
bell
cases
and
the
lockhart
case
and
the
robinson
case
in
the
courts
of
appeas.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
it's
very
kind
of
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
preceding
case
just
before
the
court
reargued.
present
case
finds
its
origin
in
an
indictment
of
petitioner
in
--
in
may
of
1944
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
southern
division,
the
indictment
had
three
counts,
the
first
count
alleged
that
the
petitioner
and
the
one
cameron,
conspired
to
violate
section
254
of
former
title
18
and
that
by
means
or
rather
that
they're
conspired
by
a
means
of
deadly
and
dangerous
weapons
to
commit
the
assault
on
agents
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
of
the
internal
revenue
service
of
the
united
states.
the
second
count
alleges
that
--
that
on
or
about
the
same
date,
may
22
of
1944,
the
defendant,
by
means
and
use
of
deadly
and
dangerous
weapons,
to
wit,
loaded
shotguns
forcibly
assaulted
a
man
named
reed,
who
was
an
agent
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
on
account
of
its
performance
of
his
official
duties
and
while
he
was
engaged
in
the
performance
of
such
duties.
and
that
the
two
defendants
shot
and
seriously
wounded
that
patient.
the
third
count
is
the
same
as
the
second
count,
except
that
a
different
agent
of
the
tax
unit
named
frost,
was
the
victim
of
the
alleged
assault.
in
june
1944,
on
the
23rd
day
of
the
month,
the
petitioner
was
arraigned,
ended
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
on
that
same
day,
he
was
tried
by
a
jury
and
found
guilty
as
charged
on
all
counts
and
on
the
same
day
he
was
sentenced.
the
practices
he
only
matter
was
this
before
this
court
held
that
the
petitioner
is
conceded
and
he
has
been
punished,
we
think,
already
for
it.
the
sentence
on
the
first
count,
the
conspiracy
count,
was
for
two
years.
on
the
second
count,
10
years
and
the
sentence
on
the
first
count
was
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentence
on
the
second
count.
the
sentence
on
the
third
year
--
on
the
third
count,
was
an
additional
10
years
and
that
was
to
be
consecutive
and
meant
running
at
the
expiration
of
the
sentence
on
the
second
count.
in
other
words,
petitioner
was
sentenced
for
20
years.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
he
has
served
--
he's
on
parole
now.
he
actually
served
about
i
think
11
or
12
years.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
was
--
about
his
own
parole,
on
the
--
on
balance
--
balance
of
his
term,
however
it's
--
there's
a
third
count
or
second,
i
don't
know.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
he
is.
all
i
know,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he's
on
parole
by
order
of
the
proper
authority.
there
is
no
transcript
of
evidence
taken
at
the
trial
and
no
appeal
from
the
original
conviction.
the
present
proceedings
commenced
in
january
of
1955
and
the
petitioner,
brought
a
motion
in
the
trial
court,
where
he
was
originally
convicted
and
sentenced
pursuant
to
section
2255
of
title
28,
to
correct
his
sentence.
his
motion
alleged,
with
the
second
and
third
count
charged,
with
a
single
offense
and
start
to
have
the
sentences
under
those
two
counts
amended
so
that
they
would
run
concurrently,
and
therefore,
he
would
have
served
his
full
sentence.
now,
the
motion
was
drawn
by
the
petitioner
without
any
professional
assistance,
i
think,
and
it
doesn't
clearly
state
whether
or
not,
there
was
only
one
shot
fired
in
accordance
with
the
allegations
of
the
indictment.
but
that
claim
is
implicit
in
the
brief
in
support
of
the
motion
and
the
case
has
been
treated
below
on
the
assumption
that
the
claim
made
by
the
petitioner
is
simply
this.
that
since
he
discharged
the
shotgun
only
once
and
struck
to
agents
that
the
single
discharge
of
the
weapon
was
only
a
single
violation
of
the
statute
and
therefore,
it
was
unlawful
to
--
to
sentence
him,
at
least,
for
two
separate
offenses
under
section
254.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
several
power
apparently,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
have
no
record
here
and
we
have
to
infer
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
my
impression
from
what
i've
seen
in
the
record
and
the
allegations
of
the
indictment.
but
there
was
a
--
the
claim
at
least
is
made
that
there
was
a
single
shotgun
shell
that
the
appellant
scattered
and
destructed
two
agents.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
there
is
no
doubt
whatever,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
but
there
was
only
one
shotgun
when
it
comes
to
that.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
--
i
thought
that
a
shotgun
has
scheduled
some
deposits
that
explodes
and
sends
out
small
pellets.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
like
they're
hand
grenades.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
that
is
exactly
my
(inaudible)
and
i
say
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
the
record
--
we
have
no
real
record
on
the
facts.
there
has
been
no
--
no
extra
testimony
as
to
the
nature
of
the
charge
refused
or
how
it
was
fired.
my
impression,
i
think,
it's
been
assumed
throughout
this
case,
if
that's
exactly
what
happened.
there
was
--
or
at
least
there's
a
claim
that's
made.
there
was
one
package,
the
pellet
scattered
and
struck
two
further
(inaudible)
i
--
i
drew
the
case
on
that
assumption.
the
motion
under
section
2255
was
denied
--
the
motion
under
section
2255
was
denied
by
judge
myers,
the
trial
judge,
he
based
his
decision
on
several
grounds,
first,
that
he
personally
remembers
that
there
was
more
than
--
that
the
evidence
showed
that
there
was
more
than
one
shot
fired.
i
point
out
that
the
trial
had
taken
place
about
ten-and-a-half
years
before
and
the
judge
may
have
had
a
good
many
other
cases
in
the
meantime.
he
admitted
however
that
no
transcript
had
been
taken.
he
stated
quite
erroneously
that
the
same
motion
has
been
made
by
the
petitioner
before
the
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
out
the
case.
there's
no
question
here
at
this
time
that
petitioner
is
making
his
request
for
relief
under
2255
a
second
time.
the
judge
was
confused
to
train
the
petitioner
and
his
codefendant
cameron
and
the
only
one
who's
made
a
motion
before
was
cameron
and
not
petitioner.
but
the
basis,
i
suppose,
on
which
judge
myers
clearly
based
his
decision
was
that
the
single
discharge
of
those
weapons
the
--
this
weapon
which
has
an
impact
onto
federal
officials,
constitutes
not
one,
but
two
offenses.
so
if
that
is
true,
the
motion
was
properly
denied.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
petitioner's
appeal
in
the
form
of
(inaudible)
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
the
record,
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
offense
we've
taken,
so
that
there
was
no
proper
record
before
the
court.
that
nevertheless,
there
appeared
in
the
record
and
the
court
doesn't
quite
know
how
it
got
there,
but
i
think
the
record
in
this
court
shows
that
the
united
states
attorney
put
it
there
or
had
the
clerk
put
it
there.
an
affidavit
of
a
man
named
(inaudible)
who
was
--
his
brother-in-law
of
these
two
defendants
in
which
the
affiant
stated
that
he
had
heard
five
shots
when
he
was
--
when
half
a
mile
away
from
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
petitioner
and
cameron,
some
minutes
before.
that's
the
--
there's
no
other
evidentiary
matter
in
the
record
except
for
that
grossly
improper
affidavit
that
doesn't
belong
here
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
this
affidavit
of
mr.
(inaudible)
should
be
disregarded
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
--
oh,
and
that
the
judge's
personal
recollection
should
also
be
disregarded
that
this
left
the
record
completely
void
of
any
evidence
could
ever
--
that
there
was
more
than
one
shot.
they
took
the
motion
of
petitioner
to
allege
that
there
was
only
one
shot
and
said
that
if
a
single
shot
constituted
only
one
violation
of
the
statute,
then
the
petitioner
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
section
2255,
that
which
he
could
be
personally
present
and
endeavor
to
show
that
there
was
indeed
only
a
single
shot.
however,
said
the
court
of
appeals,
the
single
shot
which
affects
as
an
impact
on
two
federal
agents
constitutes
two
assaults
under
the
statute
and
that
therefore,
the
motion
was
properly
denied.
because
even
if
the
petitioner
could
show
that
there
was
only
discharge
of
the
gun,
the
admission
that
two
people
were
injured
by
the
--
established
sufficient
to
support
the
sentence
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
in
its
original
opinion
upon
certain
decisions
in
its
own
circuit,
its
own
decision
under
the
mann
act,
from
which
that
court
of
appeals
have
felt
that
there
are
more
than
woman
this
court
has
for
moral
purposes
into
the
--
in
interstate
commerce.
there
are
as
many
violations
to
the
mann
act
as
there
are
women
transported,
even
though
the
transportation
takes
place
at
one
in
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
vehicle.
at
the
time
the
opinion
was
written
by
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court
has
already
ruled
to
the
contrary
in
the
bell
case.
apparently
that
the
case
has
been
overlooked
by
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
they
mentioned
the
case
and
then
said,
well,
anyway,
they
thought
there
were
to
result
in
this
case,
so
they
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
---
of
judge
myers.
the
case
was
then
brought
here
by
a
petition
for
certiorari.
and
it
is
here
and
whether
the
petitioner
was
allowed
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
as
i've
stated
before,
petitioner
is
now
on
parole.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
spend
a
time
of
this
court
arguing
that
the
cases
is
moot
on
that
account.
he's
still
under
certain
obligations
as
the
parolee
maybe
returned
to
prison
to
serve
the
balance
of
his
term
if
he
misbehaves
and
violates
the
terms
of
his
parole
agreement.
and
i
would
suppose
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
pittsburgh
against
the
united
states
and
u.s.
against
morgan,
more
recently
in
pollard
against
the
united
states.
there's
no
question
the
case
is
not
moot.
we
come
then
to
the
merits
of
petitioner's
claim.
the
statute
in
this
case
is
no
longer
apparently
criminal
code
and
has
been
replaced
under
the
revisions
of
the
code,
i
think,
in
1948.
the
statute
has
two
clauses.
first,
the
first
clause
makes
is
--
is
an
offense
to
forcibly
resist,
oppose,
impede,
intimidate
or
interfere
with
certain
federal
officials
while
they're
engaged
in
the
performance
of
official
duties
or
to
assault
section
of
an
official
on
account
of
his
official
duty.
that
is
the
first
clause
and
there
is
a
penalty
of
three
years
and
a
fine
for
violation
of
that
clause.
the
second
clause
makes
any
defense
to
use
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
in
the
commission
of
any
of
the
acts
described
in
the
section
itself.
and
for
that,
there
is
a
penalty
of
10
years
and
a
fine.
we
contend
that
the
second
clause
condemns
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
and
that
the
unit
of
prosecution
is
the
use
of
a
dangerous
or
deadly
weapon
and
that
the
consequences
of
that
use
are
not
material.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
second
clause
that
the
unit
--
if
prosecution
under
the
second
clause
is
the
use
of
the
weapon
and
it's
just
a
different
offense.
of
course,
it's
tied
into
the
first
clause,
if
he's
doesn't
condemn
the
use
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
well
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
no,
i
think
the
use
of
the
weapon
in
pursuance
of
any
of
the
acts
described
in
the
first
clause
is
the
unit
of
prosecutions
under
the
second
clause.
but
i
emphasized
the
word,
"use"
whoever
shall
use
a
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
consequences
of
the
use
are
irrelevant.
it
would
make
no
difference
he
did
impute
that's
none
at
all.
he
simply
pointed
it
at
these
two
officials.
or
they
shot
it
in
the
air,
because
he's
not
---
the
statute
doesn't
condemn
the
offense
of
shooting
anybody
or
wounding
anybody
or
even
assaulting
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
if
the
court
below
--
both
courts
below
construed
it.
but
it's
the
use
of
the
weapon
even
without
pulling
the
trigger.
it
could've
been
a
club
and
he
just
waved
it
in
the
air.
or
it
could've
waived
the
--
waive
the
gun
itself
without
pulling
the
trigger
and
he
would
have
violated
the
second
clause,
if
in
--
if
it
was
done
in
connection
with
resistance
or
opposition
or
impeding
of
federal
officials
in
the
performance
of
its
duties.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
no,
it's
a
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
he
used
the
weapon
20
times,
so
they
will
be
argued
that
there
were
20
separate
uses.
the
use,
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
--
is
the
pulling
of
the
trigger.pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
harold
rosenwald
well,
i
think
--
i
think
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
meant
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
use
in
the
particular
case
here
was
the
pulling
of
the
trigger.
he
didn't
use
it
as
a
--
a
gun.
i
mean,
he
didn't
use
it
as
a
club.
he
used
it
as
a
gun.
when
he
pulled
that
trigger
that
was
the
act
which
was
the
criminal
act
denounced
by
the
statute.
and
the
criminal
act
is
only
a
single
act
and
therefore,
there
was
only
a
single
offense.
but
had
he
pulled
that
trigger
six
or
eight
times,
we
would
have
quite
a
different
question
presented.
i
don't
want
to
conceive
that
that
regard
would
constitute
more
than
one
offense
either.
but
that's
not
the
question
here.
there
was
only
a
single
act
according
to
my
argument,
and
that
single
act
was
the
pulling
--
pressure
of
his
finger
on
the
trigger
one
time.
and
that,
i
could
guess,
there's
only
one
violation
of
the
statute
here.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
we
might,
but
we
wouldn't
have
the
same
problem
we
have
here.
we
would
have
something
closer,
i
think,
to
the
--
to
the
prince
case.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
then
--
i
have
no
--
i
make
no
claim
that
he
couldn't
have
violated
several
statutes
or
committed
several
offenses
by
a
single
act.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
have
been
charged
under
separate
statutes.
yes,
that's
happened
lot
of
times.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
no,
i
--
i
make
no
claim
that
the
criminal
transaction
always
involves
only
one
offense.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
not
at
all.
i'm
not
saying
that.
it's
conceded
that
he
could've.
but
no
such
charge
was
made.
now,
in
analyzing
the
statute
on
its
phase,
do
we
have
to
notice
that
the
word,
“assault”
isn't
the
only
word
here
and
we
have
resist,
oppose,
impede,
intimidate,
or
interfere
with
--
or
assault.
there
are
six
separate
verbs.
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
fairly
synonymous,
but
let's
take
the
case
of
mere
resistance.
if
this
petitioner,
without
any
weapon
at
all,
had
resisted
six
united
states
marshals
who
came
to
arrest
him,
ran
away
from
them
and
held
the
door
against
them,
would
this
court
say
that
he
had
committed
six
separate
violations
of
the
statute?
would
we
count
the
number
of
--
of
persons
who
resisted
and
say
that
resisting
each
and
every
one
of
them
is
a
separate
offense?
i
doubt
if
they
must
--
or
suppose
that
he
used
the
deadly
or
dangerous
weapon
and
there
was
--
let
us
say
40
marshals
sent
out
by
a
federal
district
court
to
enforce
or
particularly
important
order
of
the
court
and
the
petitioner
and
someone
else
said
--
stood
there
with
a
shotgun
and
said,
“if
anybody
comes
near
me,
i
shall
use
this
gun.”
so
the
40
marshals
hid
away.
he's
resisted
them.
he's
opposed
them,
he's
impeded
them.
he's
probably
intimidated
them.
and
he
used
a
dangerous
weapon.
could
it
be
said
that
he's
violated
the
statute
40
times
and
that
he
is
subject
to
imprisonment
of
10
years
with
each
such
violation,
i
hardly
think
so.
the
thing
that's
caused
the
trouble
here
is
that
there
was
an
actual
wounding
of
two
federal
officers
by
this
shot.
and
since
--
as
we
say
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
offense
was
completed.
when
the
shot
was
fired,
we
don't
follow
the
bullet
through
the
air
to
determine
the
consequences
of
the
shot
unless,
of
course,
there
was
another
statute
coming
into
play,
if
he
kills
someone,
and
it's
another
matter.
but
under
this
statute,
it's
the
use
of
the
weapon
which
is
forbidden.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
if
he
shot
40
times,
it
comes
to
this
question
whether
a
single
criminal
transaction
are
pursuant
to
one
impulse,
the
word
that's
used
in
the
blockburger
case
and
carried
over
into
the
universal
of
c.i.t.
commercial
--
credit
corporation
case.
whether
those
series
of
events
constitute
a
single
violation
of
the
statute,
there's
another
question.
i
wouldn't
--
actually,
a
much
more
difficult
question,
a
question
when
--
where
there
was
only
a
single
act,
and
there
are
some
provisions
of
authority
on
that
question.
and
i
would
rather
be
excused
from
answering
it
very
specifically.
i
can
argue
that
one
both
ways,
but
it's
not
this
case.
it's
much
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
would
find
that
one
act,
mr.
justice
clark,
and
i
--
the
only
case
i
know
that
has
a
real
bearing
on
that
question
is
directed
against
the
united
states
referred
to
by
this
court,
the
prince
case.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
it's
cited
in
my
brief.
in
that
case,
we
had
chose
entered
a
bank
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
a
bank.
and
in
the
course
of
his
attempt
to
rob
the
bank,
he
put
in
jeopardy
the
lives
of
two
persons.
the
weapon
which
he
employed
was
nothing
less
than
a
bomb.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
in
spite
of
the
potentialities
of
that
particular
kind
of
weapon
and
its
capability
of
injuring
a
great
many
persons,
if
he
would've
to
throw
it.
held
that
there
was
only
a
single
offense
under
the
bank
robbery
law,
because
he
had
--
it
didn't
count
the
number
of
persons
whose
lives
were
put
in
jeopardy.
there's
one
offense,
nonetheless,
despite
the
nature
of
the
weapon
and
despite
the
number
of
persons
involved.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
when
the
--
the
only
guidance
in
the
attempting
at
the
moment,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
analysis
on
the
face
of
this
statute,
i
haven't
--
which
seemed
to
me,
clear
enough
on
its
face,
so
i
haven't
yet
reached
the
question.
it
has
been
the
subject
of
several
decisions
of
this
court
in
very
recent
years
and
even
months.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
am
saying
that
reading
the
plain
english
of
this
statute,
there
is
no
need
to
go
to
strenuous
aids
to
try
to
find
its
meaning
as
it
applies
to
this
particular
case.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
makes
this
no
case.
i'm
not
--
not
talking
about
this
being
a
continuing
offense.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
no.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
right.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
agree.
the
same
mode
of
dealing
with
the
problem,
the
face
of
the
statute,
you
don't
have
to
seek
out
the
intent
of
a
legislative
--
intent
clearly
appears
on
the
provision
of
the
statute
itself
in
the
four
corners
of
this
act.
i
find
strong
reason
to
believe
that
the
number
of
persons
who
were
affected
by
the
acts
of
the
defendant
however
comparable
those
acts
maybe,
there's
no
bearing
on
the
number
of
offenses
under
the
statute;
that
this
act
was
only
a
single
act
and
the
consequences
are
immaterial,
that,
i
think,
appears.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
it
is
honored
on
the
next
point.
on
the
next
point,
the
bell
case
is
my
most
important
guide.
and
if
we
reach
that
point
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
don't
need
the
bell
case.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
what
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
need
anything.
the
statute
can
be
examined
on
its
face
and
this
problem
disposed
off
without
any
authority
because
this
is
a
new
question.
there
is
no
decision
on
the
precise
question
here
under
this
statute
or
any
exactly
similar
statute,
inquire
in
every
case
is
one
of
the
statutory
constructions.
and
i
don't
--
we
don't
even
get
to
any
authorities.
however,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
in
passing
on
petition
on
this
motion,
treated
the
statute
as
if
it
were
an
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
statute.
they
said
there
were
two
assaults
because
there
were
two
agents,
and
they
relied
upon
the
language
in
the
statute,
whoever
resist
or
assault
any
person
--
any
person,
a
single
object
of
the
verbs
they
talked
me
that
it
was
a
separate
offense
with
respect
to
each
person
affected
by
the
acts
of
the
defense.
or
to
put
it
otherwise,
they
read
the
statute
to
--
to
--
as
if
it
provided
and
whoever
wounds
any
federal
officer.
and
taking
it
on
that
basis
and
passing
my
first
contention,
if
the
statute
provided
whoever
results
any
person
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
or
whoever
wounds
any
federal
official,
then
we
come
to
the
problem
that
is
before
this
court,
in
the
bell
case,
in
the
prince
case,
in
the
universal
c.i.t.
corporation
case,
and
most
recently
in
the
gore
case.
and
i
would
accept
those
cases
now.
bell,
as
what
we
recall,
involved
a
transportation
of
two
women
across
state
lines
for
immoral
purposes,
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
vehicle.
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
--
that
the
question
before
the
court
was
to
determine
the
intention
of
congress
as
to
whether
congress
intended
to
punish
the
--
intended
to
regard
each
of
the
transportation
of
each
--
each
woman,
a
number
of
women
transported,
measure
the
number
of
offenses
of
the
statute,
or
the
act
of
transportation
itself
was
new
to
the
prosecution
and
it
didn't
matter
how
many
people
were
involved
in
the
transportation.
this
was
a
question
of
the
intention
of
congress
as
to
what
punishments
are
contemplated
as
to
what
was
the
unit
of
crime
denounced.
and
that
in
determining
this
question,
the
court
finding
the
statute
too
ambiguous
and
uncertain,
was
endeavored
to
search
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
with
any
help
it
could
be
fine.
grasping
its
drawers,
if
necessary
and
it's
frequently
is.
and
to
determine
what
congress
intended
from
that
legislative
history.
and
if
the
legislative
history
were
neutral
or
didn't
clearly
show
that
congress
intended
multiple
punishments,
then
the
doubt
would
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
accused.
and
it
would
not
be
assumed
that
congress
intended
to
provide
for
multiple
punishments
for
a
single
criminal
act,
unless
it
was
clearly
stated
in
some
way
either
in
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
and
it
was
stated
in
the
bell
case
that
congress
could
make
explicit
provisions
that
it
was
easy
enough
for
it
to
provide
as
a
transportation
of
each
woman
would
be
a
separate
offense.
and
thus
having
failed
to
do
so,
this
court
would
apply
the
usual
rule
of
state.
this
is
an
application
of
the
rule
of
strict
construction
criminal
statutes
and
would
not
find
multiple
offenses
and
allow
multiple
punishments.
the
bell
case
was
followed
by
universal
c.i.t.
corporation
case,
which
involved
the
continuous
crime
more
like
the
old
cohabitation
cases.
but
--
but
in
that
universal
c.i.t.
case,
the
court
repeated
its
general
rule
that
--
and
particularly
in
a
criminal
statute,
we
will
look
for
explicit
provisions
for
penalties
and
where
they're
not
present,
we
will
give
the
accused
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
prince
was
based
on
the
same
ground.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
was
examined.
there
was
some
evidence
in
that
legislative
history
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
punish
a
man
for
entering
a
bank
for
the
intent
to
commit
a
robbery
and
also
for
the
robbery,
it
was
somewhat
like
prosecuting
of
him
for
attempt
to
commit
a
crime
and
also
for
the
completed
offense.
in
the
last
term,
the
court
had
before
the
gore
case
which
i
have
discussed
in
my
supplemental
brief.
the
gore
case
is
a
narcotics
case.
and
the
accused
in
that
case
was
charged
by
--
in
connection
with
a
single
sale
of
narcotics,
where
they're
actually
two
separate
sales,
but
with
respect
to
each
such
sale,
he
was
charged
with
three
violations.
sales,
violating
for
statutes
that
prohibited
the
sale
of
narcotic
drugs
not
in
the
original
stamped
package,
the
violation
of
the
statute
thus
forbade
the
sale
of
narcotics
drug
except
on
a
written
order
of
the
purchasers.
and
finally
under
the
tariff
act,
i
think,
facilitating
and
concealing
the
sale
of
narcotics
drugs,
knowing
that
they've
been
unlawfully
imported.
this
court
held
in
the
gore
case
that
the
document
in
the
bell
case
would
not
be
applied.
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
majority
of
opinion
that
these
three
statutes
which
the
accused
had
violated
had
been
adopted
at
different
times
and
were
totally
separate
statutes.
and
most
important,
i
think,
that
the
entire
history
of
the
narcotics
legislations
showed
the
strong
almost
frantic
efforts
of
congress
to
stamp
out
the
narcotics
trade.
so
where
there
was
no
scope
at
all
for
the
application,
at
least,
the
majority
of
this
court
itself,
of
the
principle
in
the
bell
case
in
any
narcotics
case.
the
court
was
also
confronted
with
the
blockburger
case,
which
was
a
brilliant
point
and
had
decided
these
questions
some
years
ago.
the
present
case
is
--
is
different
from
the
gore
case,
as
the
bell
case
is
different
from
the
gore
case,
and
the
gore
case
sharply
distinguished
the
bell
case.
on
the
ground,
there
was
only
a
single
statutory
provision
involved
in
the
bell
case
and
that
there
was
no
history
of
these
efforts
of
congress
to
provide
ever
increasing
penalties
in
an
effort
to
stay
involved
in
the
narcotics
trade
as
in
this
--
the
gore
case.
the
present
case
is
very
similar
to
the
bell
case,
as
only
dealing
with
a
single
statute.
one
--
in
fact,
one
clause
of
a
single
statute,
there
is
no
such
history
as
we
have
in
the
narcotics
legislation.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
in
any
way
that
assaulting
federal
officers
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
is
not
a
serious
offense,
but
there's
--
it
just
doesn't
have
this
kind
of
--
of
strenuous
efforts
to
the
congress
to
bring
more
and
more
severe
penalties
into
play,
in
an
attempt
to
stop
the
narcotics
trade.
the
closest
case
that
we
have
then
is
bell
against
the
united
states.
and
however,
there
are
other
cases
that
i'd
like
to
mention
briefly.
or
rather
proposes
as
mentioned
personally,
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
i've
examined
it
in
my
brief,
its
set
forth
there,
all
that's
available
of
it.
there
isn't
very
much.
with
respect
to
this
particular
statute,
there
is
evidence.
the
department
of
justice
introduced
this
statute
into
congress
in
1934,
i
think.
the
--
in
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general
to
the
chairman
of
the
respective
house
committees
hearing
the
bell,
the
attorney
general
referred
to
several
other
federal
statutes
been
in
existence
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
protect
federal
officers
in
the
performance
of
their
duty.
a
couple
of
those
statutes
had
a
provision
making
it
a
crime
to
wound
a
federal
officer.
this
statute
has
no
such
provision.
from
that
i
argue,
though
i'll
admit
the
argument
doesn't
have
overwhelming
force,
that
there
was
no
intention
in
this
case
to
denounce
a
crime
of
wounding
a
federal
officer
and
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
say
no
more
and
appears
on
its
face.
now,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
there's
a
turning
opinion
in
the
gore
case.
the
problem
of
finding
the
intention
of
congress
in
the
legislative
history
in
these
cases
is
a
difficult
one
and
somewhat
frustrating.
nobody
seems
to
have
to
write
questions
on
the
--
wrote
congress,
if
someone
would
only
get
up
and
say
what
happens
if
he
shoots
a
gun
and
it
hits
two
people
and
--
and
we
would
know
a
little
more
than
we
do
what
congress
intended
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
no.
no,
i
am
not
[laughs].
until
i
find
the
legislative
history
somewhat
favorable
to
my
contention,
certainly
not
adverse
to
it.
and
since,
if
we
could
at
least
have
it
neutral,
report
then
would
apply
the
rule
in
doctrine
of
the
bell
case
that
is
enough
to
--
to
control
the
result
in
the
present
case.
and
that,
i
think,
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
that
there
is
nothing
which
remotely
suggests
and
that
congress
intended
to
punish
them,
the
petitioner
or
any
other
accused,
under
the
statute
for
the
consequences
of
this
act
rather
than
for
the
single
act
itself.
now,
let
me
run
over
the
cases
in
--
heard.
under
other
statutes
though
i
have
fully
in
mind
the
admonition
of
the
court
in
the
prince
case,
heard
each
statute
is
a
separate
matter
and
what
congress
intended
in
enacting
one
statute
is
no
evidence
for
what
is
intended
in
enacting
another.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
thus
yet,
that
was
a
question
about
(inaudible)
was
not
going
to
be
very
helpful.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
well
--
[laughter]
i
might
as
well
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
[laughs]
no.
if
i
may
--
it
was
mentioned,
a
few
of
them,
without
relying
heavily
on
them.
what
i
rely
on,
i've
already
said.
these
are
just
--
out
of
an
abundant
precaution,
i
will
move
to
the
better
cases.
it
may
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
rosenwald
that's
right.
it's
precisely
my
understanding.
and
i
--
and
the
gore
case
didn't
exactly
went
principle
of
(inaudible)
the
gore
case
steps
so
prior
to
the
principle,
but
found
evidence
of
congressional
intention
to
be
extremely
severe
in
narcotics
cases.
so
that
--
those
narcotic
cases
stand
off
as
another
--
be
held
or
they‘re
consistent
with
the
principle
or
in
application
of
it.
well,
i
really
like
to
mention
these
--
these
other
cases,
if
i
may.
the
mailbag
cases,
for
some
strange
reason,
cutting
the
mailbag
although
the
bag
would
seem
to
be
the
same
where
you
cut
several
mailbags,
there's
a
separate
offense
with
respect
to
each
mailbag.
that's
the
decision
of
this
court.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
followed
that
decision
in
ebeling
against
morgan,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief,
but
have
not
--
has
followed
that
where
there
was
a
cutting
involved.
but
where
there
was
an
effect
of
mailbags
or
processed
from
a
single
mailbag,
some
of
the
courts
that
appealed
have
found
that
there
was
only
a
single
offense
committed
and
they
distinguished
the
ebeling
case
on
the
ground
that
there
is
more
than
one
act
in
this
which
is
currently
you
have
to
have
a
separate
stroke
of
the
knife
for
these
mailbags
to
be
cut,
that
if
you
get
a
real
wide
--
wherever
you
can
carry
a
weight
of
several
mailbags
at
the
same
time,
that
was
the
only
one
act
and
therefore,
only
one
offense.
i've
seen
those
mailbags.
i
don't
see
how
they
do
it,
but
--
[laughter]
the
bank
robbery
cases
were
headed
by
prince
against
the
united
states,
remember
that
the
application,
one-third
of
the
bank
robbery
statutes
tendering
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony
and
robbing
the
bank
is
only
one
offense.
and
there
--
because
i
said,
the
court
have
applied
their
general
principle
of
statutory
construction.
more
interesting,
for
that
purpose,
is
the
cases
under
the
section
of
the
bank
robbery
law,
which
makes
in
a
--
a
criminal
offense
to
put
the
lives
of
its
--
the
life
of
a
--
any
person
in
jeopardy,
of
any
person
in
jeopardy,
in
the
commission
of
the
--
a
bank
robbery.
three
courts
of
appeals,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
held
that
there
is
only
one
offense,
no
matter
how
many
persons'
lives
were
put
in
jeopardy.
and
the
singular
language
appears,
any
person
putting
in
jeopardy
the
life
of
any
person
that
appears
in
the
bank
statute.
it
appears
in
the
mann
act.
and
it's
the
usual
language
of
statutes.
so
the
singular,
any
person
despite
of
the
government's
argument,
i
don't
think,
helps
very
much
in
the
decision
in
this
case.
there
are
state
court
decisions,
unrelated
questions
and
that
they
are
in
hopeless
conflict.
i
don't
think
they
help
very
much
except
to
say
that
where
a
matter
comes
up
in
the
state
court,
that
this
court
held
in
the
(inaudible)
against
new
jersey,
last
term.
the
state
has
a
right
to
decide
that
there
are
separate
individual
robberies,
where
several
persons
had
robbed
at
the
same.
that
was
not
a
decision
of
this
court,
but
there
were
several
robberies,
or
as
many
as
separate
crimes
with
respect
to
each
person
robbed.
this
court
simply
said,
“if
the
state
of
new
jersey
wants
to
so
hold,
that's
not
a
denial
of
due
process.”
and
there
are
cases
in
accord
in
other
states
and
there
are
cases
to
the
contrary.
in
any
offense,
the
state
court
cases
and
the
common
law
cases
have
very
little
to
do
with
determining
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
intention
of
congress
which
is
a
controlling
criterion
for
the
decisions
here.
and
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
this
particular
statute
is
what
we
are
concerned
with.
and
i
think
i've
pointed
it
right,
for
the
determination
of
their
intention.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
may
it
please
the
court?
the
government
has
introduced
various
matters
that
--
what
the
evidence
was
in
this
case,
there
is
no
record.
unless
we
keep,
there
is
no
record
here
at
all.
we
don't
know
what
the
evidence
was.
mr.
sand
has
stated
that
the
co-defendant,
mr.
cameron,
had
a
shotgun
though
it
is
--
there
was
no
evidence
to
that
effect.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
overt
action
of
the
indictment,
it
is
stated
that
the
defendant,
lovander
ladner
was
carrying
a
shotgun
in
his
hand
and
nothing
whatever
is
said
about
a
hammer.
and
in
this
affidavit
which
the
government
has
claimed,
which
appears,
too
in
this
brief,
it
is
also
said
that,
“well
mr.
carter.
i
noticed
that
lovander
ladner
was
carrying
a
shotgun
in
his
hand,”
nothing
whatever
was
said
about
the
co-defendant,
mr.
cameron.
we
don't
know
what
the
(inaudible)
had
before
it.
we
don't
know
what
the
evidence
was
that
was
presented
and
whether
it
was
contragrated
or
not.
we
simply
don't
know.
here
are
just
a
few
matters
i
want
to
mention
briefly.
government
predicates
most
of
its
argument
and
claimed
that
the
words
in
the
statute
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
duty,
it
appears
in
section
254,
mean
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
specific
intent
on
the
part
of
petitioner
or
anyone
who
brought
a
statute
to
commit
the
offense
against
the
injured
party.
i
don't
read
those
words
as
showing
any
specific
intention
whatsoever.
it
merely
--
those
words
merely
describe
the
circumstances
under
which
the
assault
or
the
resistance
or
the
opposition
occurred.
the
words
are
no
different
from
the
other
words
in
the
--
or
just
above
them
while
engaged
in
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.
and
as
the
court
will
notice
in
the
present
brief
of
the
statute,
section
111,
of
title
18,
those
words
are
pronged
together.
they're
no
longer
separated.
there's
one
compendious
phrase,
“while
engaged
in
or
on
account
of
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.”
the
government
is
using
those
words
to
support
an
argument
and
then
goes
on
and
says,
“that
the
intention
must
be
personal
with
each
defendant,
therefore,
there's
a
separate
offense
of
each
defendant.”
that
the
--
the
conclusion
is
the
premise's
end
justified,
the
conclusion
of
course
with
regard
with
it.
now,
i
want
to
--
i
made
no
contention
whatever
that
if
the
statute
said,
“whoever
wounds
an
officer
--
a
federal
officer,
let
the
wound
in
the
two
officers
(inaudible)
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case
would
constitute
two
offenses.
what
i
said
was
if
the
statute
so
read,
and
we
would
--
we
would
have
to
and
go
to
the
problem
of
the
bell
case.
and
i
argued
the
bell
case
on
that
assumption
but
it
did
say.
but,
i
certainly
didn't
concede
that
there
would
then
be
two
offenses
if
the
statute
so
read
and
i
am
clear
that
there
wouldn't
be.
now,
with
respect
to
section
2255,
i
would
suppose
that
the
words
of
the
statute
itself
were
clearly
broad
enough
to
cover
this
case.
they
are
quoted
on
page
3
of
my
brief
and
they
allow
a
prisoner
in
custody
under
sentence
of
a
court
to
be
released
if
he
shows
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
impose
a
sentence
or
if
the
sentence
was
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
or
is
in
excess
of
the
maximum
authorized
by
law.
i
can't
imagine
how
we
could
come
more
clearly
within
the
statute.
there's
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
statute
about
what
facts
can
be
shown.
if
the
records
of
the
court
don't
show
conclusively
that
he's
not
entitled
for
relief,
under
the
statue,
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
what
facts
are
necessary
to
show
whether
they
were
brought
before
the
jury
or
not,
the
statute
decided
on
all
of
that.
the
remedy
has
been
used
repeatedly
in
cases
of
excessive
sentences.
it
was
used
in
the
gore
case.
it
was
used
in
the
bell
case.
in
most
of
the
cases
cited
in
my
brief,
either
habeas
corpus
or
section
2255
were
used
to
attack
an
excessive
sentence.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
it
could
have.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
yes.
mr.
harold
rosenwald
both.
followed.
we
can
always
--
we
can
do
it
both
ways,
do
it
any
time
as
long
as
the
matter
is
still
moot.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
early
occasion
seemed
to
hold
this
will
tell
you,
certainly,
the
legal
party
is
sentenced,
you
may
not
invoke
habeas
corpus
or
2255.
those
two
half
the
way.
it's
too
bad
we
have
to
go
back
there
in
13
years
and
i
suppose
the
petitioners
thought
that
until
he
served
the
10-year
legal
sentence,
he
has
no
right
to
bring
this
motion.
he
did
not
have
to
raise
it
on
appeal
and
the
question
remains
open
to
that.
