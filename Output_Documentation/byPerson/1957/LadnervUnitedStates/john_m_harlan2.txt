they
could
mention
the

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

of
those
cases?
justice
john
m.

a
record
in
this
case?
justice

--
(

that
they
walked
into
the
room
and
saw
three
federal

didn't
you
put
anything
to

it's
noted
at
the
passing,
and
ended
with
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous
although
it
ought
to
be
strictly
construed.
what
fact
is
present
here
that
isn't
in
the

to
use
the
officers
in
the
first
clause
without
any
interference,

john

the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
between
you
as
to
whether
it
was
one
shot
or
dozen
shot?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
think
it
makes
a
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
difference
