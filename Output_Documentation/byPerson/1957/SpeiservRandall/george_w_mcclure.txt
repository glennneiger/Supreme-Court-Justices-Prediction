mr.
george
w.
mcclure
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
about
seven
minutes,
i
want
to
analyze
very
briefly
the
words
and
phrases,
used
in
this
oath
and
to
show
that
those
words
and
phrases
have
been
upheld
in
other
cases
by
this
court
and
by
other
courts.
the
oath
is
a
declaration
that
the
personal
organization
making
the
statement
return
or
other
document
does
not
advocate.
i'm
reading
--
i'm
sorry,
from
page
iv
at
the
back
of
appellant's
consolidated
brief,
the
white
brief,
down
in
the
middle
of
the
long
paragraph
on
that
page.
a
declaration
that
the
personal
organization
making
the
statement
securing
no
other
document
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
california
by
a
force
or
a
violence
or
--
or
other
unlawful
means
nor
advocate
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities.
we
come
first
to
the
word
advocate.
this
is
present
advocacy
and
not
past
nor
future
advocacy.
in
the
garner
and
hoffman
cases,
these
cases
are
all
cited
in
this
brief.
the
advocacy
was
for
a
period
of
five
years
prior,
in
one
case,
to
the
passage
of
the
statute
and
then
the
other
case
to
the
taking
of
the
oath.
in
the
fitzgerald
versus
philadelphia
case,
the
--
both
required
was
a
promising
that
there
would
be
no
future
advocacy.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
it
has
the
same
meaning
past
or
present,
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
that's
true
but
i
--
i
--
our
position
is,
that
the
word
is
not
ambiguous.
however,
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
i
think
it
means
what
the
court
has
said
and
meant
in
the
dennis
and
yates
cases.
it
means
the
--
the
calling,
invocation
or
the
incitement
to
whatever
thing
is
being
advocated.
in
this
case,
the
forceful
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
that
can
be
as
in
the
yates
case
and
in
--
in
the
dennis
case
even
a
future
violent
act
can
be
the
subject
of
present
advocacy
and
still
be
unlawful.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
we
have
the
--
the
word
“advocacy”
used,
in
the
number
of
oaths
and
declarations
that
have
been
passed
on
by
the
courts
and
i
think
that
they
had
generally
taken
the
view
that
it
means
something
more
than
expressing
their
belief.
it
means
the
calling
forth
of
something
on
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
i
suppose
he
searches
his
conscience
and
if
he's
a
lawyer,
he
reached
the
dennis
and
yates
cases
and
if
he
isn't
he
just
answers
it
on
some
common
sense
basis.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
i
don't
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
i
would
say
that
advocacy
clearly
means
some
expression
whether
there
are
oral
or
written.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
but
not
merely
speeches
about
--
speeches
calling
for
some
action
or
conduct
on
--
on
the
part
of
the
listeners.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
he
truthfully
sign
it.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
in
the
election
of
november
1952,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
you
mean,
when
was
it
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
my
recollection
is
those
things
come
out
about
a
month
ahead
of
the
general
election
in
november.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
unless
this
might
possibly
had
been
in
the
summer
at
the
primary
but
i
think
constitutional
members
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
it
was
to
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
it
was
only
two
years,
your
honor,
at
the
garner
and
douds.
it
was
two
years
after
those.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
then
one
year
after
garner
and
two
years
after
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
the
argument
on
one
side
was
drafted
by
a
lawyer
for
the
(inaudible)
and
on
the
other
side,
i
think
by
a
state
legislator
but
i
don't
know
whether
he's
a
lawyer.
but
i
assume
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
that's
correct.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
but
we
left
a
notice
to
the
people
--
was
that
the
court
had
passed
on
the
old
--
in
the
garner
case
which
went
far
further
than
this
oath
does.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
it
is
did.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
not
really
to
overrule
the
supreme
court
but
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
no,
it
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
those
words.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
that's
correct,
your
honor,
undoubtedly,
drafted
by
the
legislative
council's
officer.
but
in
that
case,
in
--
in
the
garner
oath,
there
was
a
requirement
that
you
state
that
you
did
not
advocate
within
five
years
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
law.
insofar
as
i
know,
that
oath
is
still
required
by
public
employees
in
that
jurisdiction.
furthermore,
there
was
a
non-membership
privilege
in
--
in
that
oath.
the
--
again,
on
the
subject
of
advocacy,
this
oath
does
not
touch
affiliations
and
beliefs
which
were
contained
in
the
oaths
in
the
douds
case
and
the
gerende
versus
board
of
supervisors,
shub
versus
simpson,
the
garner
case
and
friedrich
cases.
the
advocate
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
he
has
to
sign
our
form
of
declaration
because
the
statue
says
he
doesn't
get
that
exemption.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
if
he
signs
the
declaration
and
makes
that
further
explanation
of
it,
our
advice
to
the
assessor
would
be
to
allow
him
the
exemption
i
think
because
it
doesn't
strike
the
beliefs
and
it
doesn't
strike
at
the
discussion
as
an
abstract
principle
where
the
merits
or
demerits
of
a
particular
cause,
on
the
subject
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
whether
it
be
the
national
or
the
state
government
in
the
whitney
case
of
course,
the
oath
or
the
conduct
which
resulted
in
the
criminal
division
was
controlled
by
a
statute
which
protected
the
industrial
ownership
and
control
and
not
merely
the
--
the
government
of
the
--
of
the
state
and
also
that
it
protected
the
economic
system,
that
was
the
criminal
cynical
of
the
statute.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
do
i
think
our
supreme
court
will?
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
you
mean
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
we
--
we
don't
read
the
opinion
that
way,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
read
as
saying
this
declaration
controls
or
seeks
to
have
some
--
something
to
do
with
the
same
kind
of
conduct
as
the
smith
act.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
no,
the
court
itself
has
said
that
it
controls
--
that
it
relates
to
the
same
conduct
as
the
smith
act.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
the
language
is
on
pages
17
and
18
of
our
brief,
this
white
brief.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
and
on
page
53
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
in
--
in
this
case,
no,
in
the
unitarian
church
case.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
18
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
the
italics
at
the
bottom
of
that
indented
paragraph
on
page
18,
in
which
--
in
which
our
supreme
court
was
referring
to
the
dennis
decision.
in
davis
against
beason,
this
court
upheld
an
oath
that
prohibiting
advocacy
of
bigamy
and
in
fitzgerald
versus
philadelphia,
the
oath
there
concern
the
altering
of
the
former
government
or
denying
rights
to
others,
all
of
which
are
less
formidable
threats
to
the
state
than
its
own
overthrow.
as
to
force
and
violence
or
other
unlawful
means,
this
language
was
used
in
the
oath
in
the
douds
case
and
in
the
garner
case
and
in
the
whitney
case
and
in
the
putman
and
fitzgerald
cases.
in
adler
versus
board
of
education,
this
court
upheld
the
feinberg
law
in
new
york
which
related
to
an
oath
regarding
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
any
unlawful
means.
with
petition
regarding
the
advocacy
of
war
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
this
government,
we
think
it's
helpful
to
read
case
of
gilbert
versus
minnesota
in
which
case
--
in
which
this
case
this
court
upheld
a
minnesota
state
statute
punishing
the
speaking
against
the
united
states
participation
and
in
that
case,
it
was
in
world
war
i
of
course
and
said
that
this
was
a
valid
encouragement
of
patriotism
on
--
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
that
the
states
stood
to
suffer
as
much
from
a
defeat
as
the
national
government
and
it
was
the
citizens
of
the
states
which
made
up
the
national
armies.
the
conduct
advocating
war
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
our
government
is
merely
a
particular
form
of
the
same
kind
of
conduct
which
is
reached
by
the
first
provision
which
is
advocacy
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government
and
has
the
additional
evil
or
the
additional
reprehensibility
of
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
war
support
of
a
foreign
government.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
that
means
taking
the
position
that
if
in
and
when
there
are
hostilities
and,
of
course,
they
may
be
at
the
time
that
the
speech
is
made
or
they
may
be
in
the
future.
but
at
that
time
during
a
period
of
hostilities
that
one
should
work
for
the
victory
of
a
foreign
government
over
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
i
don't
know
whether
how
far
the
moral
support
would
carry
us.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
certainly,
in
some
cases
i
would
think
that
the
moral
support
would
be
covered
by
this
in
other
cases
but
it's
not.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
i
would
say
that
that
language
reaches
the
same
--
the
same
access
as
that
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
that
they
do
not
now
advocate
the
commission
of
treason.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
in
time
of
hostilities.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
i
think
with
me
it's
very
much
the
same
thing,
except
that
what
their
--
our
declaration
is
that
they
do
not
advocate
this
and
this
is
either
treason
or
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities.
but
what
--
what
they're
asked
to
declare
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
i
think
that
means
practically
the
same
thing
as
this,
but
they
do
not
now
advocate
that.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
well,
in
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
in
the
first
place,
i
--
i
don't
see
what's
wrong
with
the
statute
passed
now
that
it
hasn't
viewed
some
evil
that
may
arise
in
the
future.
there
may
be
another
war.
this
language
was
passed
in
1952
when
at
the
korean
hostilities
were
not
at
the
boiling
point
then
they
had
only
recently
subsided
from
very
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
he
incites
others
to
act
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities
or
supports,
incites
them
to
support.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
it
could
be.
let's
assume
that
a
person
to
whom
this
oath
might
possibly
apply
would
have
a
much
easier
time
taking
it
now
than
he
would
if
there
were
actually
a
war
going
on.
it's
true
because
right
now
there
are
no
hostilities.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
advocacy
is
still
the
key
word
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes,
if
they
don't
incite
each
other.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
yes.
mr.
george
w.
mcclure
they
can
believe
what
they
want.
