justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
indicating
in
a
word
why
the
householder's
exemption
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
excluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
too
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
legislative
entirely
is
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
are
you
implying
that
this
court
must
be
convinced
that
there
was
great
danger
of
people
proposing
the
more
or
less
immediate
overthrow
of
the
government
of
california
or
the
united
states?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
would
be
all
right
that
if
it
were
explicitly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
there
anything
but
a
substantive
due
process
involved
in
any
of
this?
what
is
procedure
of
due
process
of
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wish
i
--
i
wish
i
felt
clear
that
i
knew
what
were
you
saying
but
i
understood
what
you
are
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
except
the
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
maybe
my
fault
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
don't
let
me
dissuade
from
your
course
of
arguments.
typically,
you've
a
--
a
lot
of
words.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would'nt
be
infringement
because
you
have
to
make
an
oath
or
because
the
oath
is
calculated
to
inhibit
speech
which,
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
even
if
the
difficulty
that
--
that
you're
being
--
you're
being
prohibited
from
uttering
statements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
it
you're
being
prohibited
from
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
comes
only
if
you're
compelled
to
obey
the
oath.
so,
you
cannot
talk
about
the
oath.
that's
what
all
of
this
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
--
if
you
don't
care
to
take
the
oath
then
there's
no
--
then
this
--
what
we're
now
concerned
with
doesn't
do
any
inhibiting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
that
--
whether
it's
the
constitution
or
the
statute
and
enforcement
of
it,
it
doesn't
operate
unless
you
claim
an
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
what
if
--
what
inhibits
you
when
it
is
there,
review
the
constitution
it
says
you
can't
claim
an
exemption
under
these
circumstances
or
the
oath
because
you
must
determine
if
we'll
make
some
disavowal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
doesn't
come
into
play
unless
you
claim
an
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
come
into
being
unless
you
claim
an
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
i'm
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
would
--
but
there
is
an
abstract
--
this
abstract
talk
or
what
there
is
or
isn't
in
that
opinion
all
hinges
on
whether
or
not
the
demand
of
the
constitution
in
the
first
place
and
the
oath
in
the
second
restricting
--
conditioning
your
acceptance
or
getting
an
exemption.
that's
the
thing
that
does
it
and
not
these
abstract
talks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
make
claim,
if
you
yourself
haven't
claimed
an
exemption,
you
wouldn't
be
here
in
any
case,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it's
the
coercive
powers
applies
this
coercive
of
claiming
an
exemption
subject
a
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
i
--
i
think
this
is
a
territory
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
in
which
one
has
to
be
scrupulously
and
meticulously
accurate
and
concrete
instead
of
riding
off
into
large
talk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
your
--
you
can't
hearsay,
this
is
bad
because
it
affects
the
church's
attendance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
got
all
exemptions
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
somebody
come
here
who
doesn't
pay
any
income
tax
and
complain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
can
somebody
in
your
--
suppose
you
didn't
have
any
income
tax
report?
could
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
you
haven't
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
were
not
presenting
the
position
of
the
unitarian
church.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
could
decide
against
you
and
yet
decide
for
the
unitarian
church,
couldn't
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
but
you're
not
here
for
the
unitarian
church.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far,
as
it
affects
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
anybody
in
your
category
if
you're
in
that
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
--
but
isn't
the
content
of
the
term
of
a
concept
advocacy
as
ambiguous
whether
it
relates
to
the
past
or
to
the
present?
if
advocacy
as
such
at
the
difficulties
of
advice
or
the
limitations
or
the
fallibilities
of
ambiguity
with
reference
to
past,
how
did
it
contain
an
unequivocal
meaning
with
reference
to
the
person?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you
do
still
have
to
meet
whether
the
term
isn't
inherently
the
ambiguous,
or
at
least
ambiguous
to
your
content
just
refers
in
time
to
take
a
note
in
denial
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
to
deny
in
something
that's
ambiguous,
you
don't
know
what
you're
denying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
a
verne
advocates
that
the
world
is
flat,
that's
a
mode
of
saying
that's
what
he
believes
despite
all
the
evidence
to
the
contrary.
but
if
he
wants
to
get
recruit
for
some
purpose
for
that
view,
that's
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
also
(inaudible)
--
there
are
those
of
us
who
had
difficulty
with
that
view
as
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcclure
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
when
was
this
amendment
put
the
vote
here
at
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
it
first
--
when
was
it
admitted
into
public?
that
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
supporting
memorandum,
whatever
it's
called
put
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
somewhere
on
september,
october
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
1952.
it's
all
1952.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
was
a
full
year.
that's
one
full
year.
now,
to
this
court
in
garner,
they'll
call
upon
to
reinterpret
what
the
word
advocacy
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
some
of
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1951,
probably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
that
--
that
the
amendment
was
drafted,
at
least
overseen
by
lawyers
and
the
memorandum
was
drawn
by
lawyers.
is
that
a
fair
inference
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
that
this
court
in
1961
in
a
--
in
litigation
in
a
--
a
case
within
this
general
appeal
dealt
with
the
california
situation
and
indicated
the
difficulty
of
its
term
with
the
concept
gone
and
even
in
the
court's
opinion
they
have
to
rewrite
it.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
right
if
construe
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
was
just
wondering
whether
one
is
entitled
to
say
that
--
that
this
was
put
to
the
people
of
california,
in
all
events
incorporated
in
its
constitution
and
its
laws
with
notice
from
this
court
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
ticklish,
dubious
term'
“advocacy”
susceptible
of
different
interpretations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it
had
to
be
reinterpreted
with
--
with
several
doubts
expressed
by
the
(inaudible)
in
this
court.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
court's
opinion
isn't
the
court's
decision.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
that
--
made
clear
the
difficulties
of
this
kind
of
a
problem
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
the
term
was
put
back
by
the
voters
by
legally
informed
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
in
what
part
of
that
oath
advance
the
problem
namely,
that
you
can't
place
this
burden
upon
him?that's
what
the
whole
shooting
is
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
you
read
that
from
the
brief
in
the
unitarian
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
would
you
--
may
i
--
may
i
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
about
it.
would
you
say
that
(inaudible)
i
assume
you
are
that
the
clause,
the
meaning
that
with
your
supreme
court
is
based
upon
that
as
such
explicit
which
it
wouldn't
defend
(inaudible)
the
constitution
and
discussion
explicitly
said
you
must
take
an
oath
that
weren't
today
not
going
to
do
that
to
reach
this
court
as
you
say
because
it
has
said
in
the
dennis
case
is
saying
the
validity
of
smith
act.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
have
to
have
to
say
more,
and
you
do
--
you
are
saying
more.
not
as
we
should
read
it
that
way.
if
you
say
that
this
--
the
constitution
and
--
and
statute
of
california
has
come
here
will
that
raise
an
interest
by
your
supreme
court
which
governed
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
what
--
what
--
if
that's
what
you're
saying,
that
is
what
your
court
is
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
not
a
good
prophet
of
what
they
would
say,
but
that
is
--
but
that's
of
a
different
order
from
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
in
regards
to
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
