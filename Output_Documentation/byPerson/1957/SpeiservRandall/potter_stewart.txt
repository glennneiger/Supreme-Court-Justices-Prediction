justice
potter
stewart
but
what
i
don't
quite
understand
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
mr.
mcclure,
i
thought
you
suggested
that
advocate
in
this
relation
means
the
same
thing
as
it
does
in
relation
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
namely,
that
they
do
not
advocate
in
the
sense,
they
do
not
incite
to
action,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
bothers
me
is
how
one
today
when
there
are
no
hostilities,
incites
to
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
--
what
is
it,
the
support
of
foreign
power
in
event
of
and
so
forth.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
the
action?
what
i
don't
quite
understand
is
what
is
the
action
to
which
the
claimant
for
exemption
incites
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
they
--
it's
not
the
present
action
then
it's
action
someday
maybe
never,
maybe
50
years,
maybe
10
years,
maybe
year,
hence.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
again
he
has
to
ask
himself
whether
he
sits
back
and
really,
really
believes
that
we
oath
that
he
oath
to
support
on
these
or
that
he
merely
talk
to
others
than
they
are
to
support
enemies
or
whether
he
somehow
incites
them
to
do
something
in
the
event
of
hostility
in
the
way
of
supporting
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
wondering
suppose
--
i
know
that's
not
this
case
you're
dealing
with
in
as
a
matter
of
exemption
case
but
going
to
the
arguments
of
yesterday,
would
you
give
the
same
advice
to
your
assessor
which
you
told
me
you've
given
this
instance
if
the
church
we
were
talking
about
yesterday
have
a
thousand
members.
i'll
file
an
application
signed
by
the
secretary
signed
your
form,
but
he
said
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
all
thousand
of
us,
however,
do
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
all
of
us
believed
it
and
we
talk
about
it
in
our
meeting.
but
in
the
sense,
we
don't
go
out
and
incite
others
why
we
are
signing
this
affidavit.
would
you
recommend
to
the
assessor
that
the
exemption
be
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i've
--
i've
given
you
--
i've
given
you
the
hypothesis
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
they're
just
talking
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
at
all
our
meetings,
and
all
thousands
of
them
believe
it,
all
thousands
of
them
talk
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
interpretation
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
has
given?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
advocacy
of
inciting
others
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
that
sentence.
