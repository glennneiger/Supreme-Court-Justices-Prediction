mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
would
like
to
discuss
two
points
in
the
cases
of
which
i
think
are
fundamental
both
to
these
cases
as
well
as
to
the
preceding
ones.
one
is
the
question
of
the
infringement
on
freedom
of
speech
as
encompassed
within
the
language
of
the
constitutional
amendment
and
within
revenue
and
taxation
code
section
32
and
the
reason
why
this
language
has
not
been
limited
by
the
state
supreme
court
and
its
interpretation
of
it
to
language
of
advocacy
as
a
rule
of
incitement
but
encompasses
within
it,
advocacy
which
is
--
which
may
be
merely
discussion
or
advocacy
of
abstract
principles.
and
secondly,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
fact
that
there
is
no
legitimate
legislative
objective
to
the
constitutional
amendment
which
is
an
issue
here
and
that
is
totally
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
various
exemptions
which
are
granted
under
state
law.
now,
it
has
been
indicated
in
various
decisions
and
i
believe
that
the
appellees
will
agree
that
indirect
infringements
on
freedom
of
speech
may
be
fully
as
coercive
in
their
effect
as
direct
infringement.
the
douds
case
seemed
to
indicate
that
and
justice
burton
indicated
that
in
a
situation
like
this
where
individuals
fall
within
a
general
class
in
which
they
would
otherwise
obtain
an
exemption
if
they
are
excluded
from
this.
isn't
this
in
effect
a
direct
tax?
my
answer
is
yes,
this
would
be
just
the
same
effect.
you're
looking
at
the
substance
of
the
matter
not
the
form.
now,
if
you
do
have
an
indirect
infringement,
as
i
contend
that
you
do,
in
this
case,
then
there
has
to
be
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
terms
of
the
particular
legislation
with
constitutional
amendment
affect
free
speech
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
terms
themselves.
now,
first
of
all,
there
was
no
interpretation
on
the
part
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
second
clause,
advocacy
of
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities.
so
there
is
no
gloss
on
that.
there
is
no
indication
as
to
whether
they
were
merely
restricting
that
to
advocacy
which
might
be
advocacy
in
the
form
of
incitement.
now,
as
far
as
the
first
part
is
concerned,
the
state
supreme
court
said
this.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
first
unitarian
church
cases
sets
forth
their
reasoning
for
the
decisions
which
they
made
in
the
cases
here
at
issue.
so
i'm
going
to
be
referring
to
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
most
of
the
time
and
its
opinion
in
the
first
unitarian
church
cases
which
came
up
just
before
the
cases
that
issue.
they
are
printed
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
they
are
not
printed
in
the
record
of
our
case.
now
on
page
39
of
the
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
state
supreme
court
said
this,
“in
the
present
case,
it
is
apparent
that
the
limitation
imposed
by
section
19
of
article
20
as
a
condition
of
exemption
from
taxation
is
not
a
limitation
on
mere
belief
but
is
a
limitation
on
action.
the
advocacy
of
certain
proscribed
conduct.
what
one
may
merely
belief
is
not
prohibited.
it
is
only
advocates
of
the
subversive
doctrines
who
are
affected.
advocacy
constitutes
action
and
the
instigation
of
actions
not
mere
belief
or
opinion.
now,
there's
no
reference
in
their
discussion
at
all
to
advocacy
which
discussion,
advocacy
of
abstract
principles.
they
apparently
make
just
two
categories,
advocacy
of
action
--
excuse
me,
advocacy
which
constitutes
action.
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
they
mean
by
that
but
--
and
then
advocacy
which
is
instigation
of
action
and
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence,
not
mere
belief
or
opinion.
from
the
tenor
of
their
remarks
though,
it
is
apparent
that
they
seem
to
feel
that
advocacy
itself
is
action
and
this
is
not
true.
this
court
has
had
this
matter
before
it
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
the
advocacy
of
action.
that
isn't
how
the
question
is
decided.
it's
whether
speech
is
so
close
to
action
in
certain
situations
that
the
state
may
validly
place
limitations
on
it.
so,
i
feel
that
they
have
incorrectly
talk
of
advocacy
in
terms
of
action
and
since
they
have
left
out
this
broad
area
with
which
we
are
mainly
concerned
of,
what
about
advocacy
that
does
not
take
on
the
color
of
action.
it
isn't
incitement
but
it's
merely
advocacy
in
the
form
of
discussion,
advocacy
which
is
in
the
form
of
--
of
pleading.
where
does
that
fit
in?
they
don't
discuss
this.
they
make
the
two
categories,
advocacy
constituting
action
and
instigation
that's
action
and
belief
or
opinion.
then
they
go
on
to
explain
themselves
and
discuss
the
dennis
case
and
what
they
conceive
to
be
the
holding
of
the
dennis
case
and
this
is
where
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear
that
they
have
misinterpreted
the
dennis
case
and
what
advocacy
may
or
may
not
be
punished
or
penalized.
on
the
jurisdictional
statements
of
the
instant
cases
on
page
46,
the
court
says,
“in
that
case,
dennis
versus
the
united
states,
the
court
upheld
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
if
the
defendants
actively
advocated
governmental
overthrow
by
force
and
violence
as
feebly
as
circumstances
would
permit,
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
is
sufficient
danger
of
a
substantive
evil
that
the
congress
has
the
right
to
prevent
to
justify
the
application
of
the
statute
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.”
in
the
present
case,
the
constitutional
provision
is
concerned
with
those
who
advocate
the
same
prohibited
activity.
well,
if
they
had
correctly
stated
what
dennis
meant,
then
i
would
not
be
able
to
make
the
point
that
i'm
making
but
they
have
incorrectly
stated
it
and
they
--
they
stated
it
in
even
less
rigorous
terms
and
the
trial
court
had
in
yates
which
this
court
recently
determined
was
not
sufficient
in
--
to
define
advocacy
which
may
be
penalized.
now,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
yates
and
--
and
in
dennis
and
justice
frankfurter's
conferring
opinion
in
dennis
that
there
are
three
factors
in
determining
the
advocacy
that
may
be
penalized
that
one,
was
that
it
be
a
rule
of
action,
two,
by
language
that
reasonably
calculated
to
incite
persons
to
such
action
and
three,
and
was
intended
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit.
the
state
supreme
court
makes
no
references,
no
reference
to
any
of
those
three
factors.
they
do
so
in
the
term
as
speedily
as
circumstances
permit.
they
used
the
term
“actively
advocate”
and
i'm
not
sure
what
they
mean
by
that.
you
may
actively
discuss.
you
may
actively
advocate
as
an
--
an
abstract
principle.
so,
they
don't
talk
about
advocacy
as
a
rule
of
action
and
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
hit
at
that
type
of
advocacy.
even
the
yates
instruction
was
better
than
the
--
the
instruction
of
the
lower
court
in
yates
was
better
than
this
because
they
at
least
have
the
last
factor.
and
then
to
further
make
clear
of
the
fact
that
they
completely
misconstrued
advocacy
which
may
be
penalized,
they
make
the
statement
and
it's
on
the
jurisdiction
--
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
appendix,
page
47.
it
must
be
said
that
such
advocacy
from
whatever
source
imposes
a
threat
to
our
government
and
that
the
gravity
of
the
evil
is
not
to
be
materially
discounted
by
its
improbability
from
the
meaning
of
the
test
which
employed
in
the
dennis
case.
there,
they
directly
misstate
the
hand
rule
which
was
adopted
in
the
--
the
dennis
case
because
the
hand
rule
says
that
the
gravity
of
the
evil
is
to
be
discounted
by
its
improbability.
and
yet,
the
state
supreme
court
says
that
the
gravity
of
the
evil
is
not
to
be
materially
discounted
by
its
improbability.
now,
the
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i
am
suggesting
that
in
this
case
that
there
is
an
infringement
on
freedom
of
speech.
whether
its
justified
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment,
but
i'm
arguing
the
fact
that
the
state
supreme
court
in
its
interpretation
meant
to
include
within
the
context
of
the
constitutional
amendment
in
the
oath,
advocacy
protected
by
the
first
amendment
unless
there's
some
justifiable
reason
for
infringing
on
it.
now,
the
reason
i'm
making
this
distinction
because
of
the
question
that
your
honor
raised
yesterday
in
which
you
posed
to
mr.
warren
an
oath
framed
in
terms
of
incitement
as
distinct
from
in
terms
of
advocacy
which
may
be
speech.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
in
terms
of
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
i
--
i
would
not
because
there
are
substantive
due
process
questions
involved
there
as
to
whether
there
is
a
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
i'm
not
making
--
i'm
not
raising
the
point
of
procedural
due
process.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
but
in
--
when
i
use
the
term
substantive
due
process,
i
was
speaking
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
and
whether
the
mean
selected
have
some
reasonable
relation
to
that
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
i
was
distinguishing
that
from
the
free
speech
question
which
i
agree
falls
within
the
context
of
substantive
due
process
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
there
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
and
what
--
then
its
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
--
my
--
my
job
to
--
to
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
then
may
i
--
may
i
state
it
again?
there
are
two
problems
that
i
feel
are
involved
in
this
case
of
major
importance.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
problem
as
to
whether
there
is
an
infringement
on
freedom
of
speech.
this,
i
grant
you,
comes
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
in
determining
whether
there
is
an
infringement
on
freedom
of
speech,
i
first
of
all,
have
to
determine
whether
speech
is
being
affected
by
it.
this
was
the
gist
of
what
i
--
of
my
argument
up
to
this
point.
now,
once
i've
determined
that,
that
doesn't
solve
the
question.
there
are
still
some
other
problems
involved
and
that
is
whether
the
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
--
i
will
talk
about
it
in
the
context
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
leave
the
oath
out
entirely.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
under
the
interpretation
of
the
state
supreme
court,
the
--
there
is
an
inhibition
on
uttering
speech
which
is
--
does
not
get
to
the
status
of
incitement,
does
not
get
to
the
status
of
a
rule
of
action
and
there
is
an
inhibition
in
speech
--
on
speech
of
that
kind.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
--
i
can
--
i
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor,
in
the
fact
that
the
state
supreme
court
said
first
of
all,
the
constitutional
amendment
which
denies
tax
exemption
to
advocates
of
these
doctrines
is
self-executing.
i
--
now,
i
can't
find
a
sentence
in
which
it
says
it
but
throughout
it,
the
--
it
is
apparent.
it
says
that
the
constitutional
amendment
is
mandatory
and
prohibitory.
it
applies
to
all
tax
exemptions
and
then
it
says
the
--
the
oath
provision
of
revenue
and
taxation
code
section
32
is
merely
a
procedural
device.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
the
oath
being
just
a
procedural
device,
still
you
have
the
question
about
the
constitutional
amendment
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
--
itself.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct
and
in
similar
case
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
true
but
once
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
all
right.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct
and
the
exemption
was
denied
by
reason
of
the
constitutional
amendments
implemented
by
the
procedural
device
as
the
oath
itself.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now,
in
determining
whether
there
is
an
infringement
on
--
on
free
speech,
we
not
only
have
to
look
at
the
content
of
the
oath,
we
also
have
to
look
at
its
sweep
because
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
if
i
am
correct,
the
constitutional
amendment
as
the
state
supreme
court
said,
it's
self-executing.
it's
mandatory
and
prohibitory
applies
to
all
exemptions
then
the
sweep
of
it
is
all
exemptions.
the
mere
fact
that
i
happen
to
be
here
on
one
particular
type
of
exemption
is
merely
because
the
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
can
--
i
can
look
at
the
terms
of
it
and
i
can
look
at
it
as
the
state
supreme
court
interpreted
it.
the
state
supreme
court
says
it
applies
to
all
exemptions
and
i
talked
about
a
lot
of
different
exemptions.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
we
have
two
classes,
your
honor,
because
the
constitutional
amendment
made
two
classes.
it
says
one
class
is
advocates,
the
other
is
non-advocates.
non-advocates
we'll
give
exemptions
to,
advocates,
we
won't.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
not
at
this
stage
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
not
unless
the
state
attempted
to
prevent
whatever
income
i
did
have
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
--
from
being
exempt.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
if
i
had
no
income?
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i'm
not
attempting
to.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
i'm
presenting
--
excuse
me,
i
--
i
am
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
am
presenting
that
the
free
speech
question
which
i
think
is
inherent
in
the
first
unitarian
church
cases
as
well
as
the
cases
at
bar
now.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
you
could,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
but
i
--
i
am
raising
the
question
of
free
speech
which
i
think
is
inherent
in
--
in
the
--
any
case
coming
up
under
the
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
not
as
long
as
i
follow
within
the
category
of
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
and
i'm
in
the
category
that's
been
affected
by
the
constitutional
amendment
in
which
makes
two
categories,
advocates
and
non-advocate.
now,
in
determining
what
the
purpose
of
the
constitutional
amendment
and
this
comes
to
the
second
point
that
i'm
raising
or
have
--
we
can
look
at
the
language
of
the
state
supreme
court
and
then
look
at
the
purposes
of
exemptions
because
it
says
that
it
applies
to
all
exemptions.
the
purpose
--
so
the
state
supreme
court
says,
and
this
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
on
page
31,
“it
may
properly
be
said
that
the
primary
purpose
for
article
20
was
to
provide
for
the
protection
of
the
revenues
of
the
state
from
impairment
by
those
who
would
seek
to
destroy
it
by
unlawful
means.”
well,
this
was
not
suggested
either
by
the
legislature
nor
even
by
the
appellees.
they
haven't
even
picked
this
up
in
their
brief.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
impairment
which
has
been
shown.
the
only
effect
that
this
could
have
would
be
to
increase
revenues,
not
impairment
with
starting
out
with
exemptees
as
a
group,
the
exemptions
which
have
been
granted.
and
i'm
not
contending
that
exemptions
rights.
i
have
recognized
they're
privileges
and
gratuities.
and
then
the
second
purpose
which
was
suggested
by
the
state
supreme
court
was
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
maintaining
the
loyalty
of
its
people
and
thus
safeguarding
against
its
violent
overthrow
by
internal
or
external
forces.
well,
this
argument
doesn't
hold
up
because
that
there
isn't
any
way
that
this
does
prevent
the
violent
overthrow.
now,
with
regard
to
loyalty,
but
the
question
was
like,
this
is
really
to
induce
loyalty
and
that
the
state
supreme
court
was
looking
at
the
constitutional
amendment
when
it
made
the
statement.
now,
if
you're
going
to
determine
the
purpose
of
it
and
connection
with
tax
exemptions,
we
have
to
look
at
all
of
them.
you
can't
just
look
at
the
veteran.
you
have
to
look
at
income
tax
exemption.
what
is
the
purpose
of
--
of
an
income's
tax
exemption.
is
it
to
promote
loyalty
or
cemeteries
or
churches
or
growing
crops
and
fruit
in
not
growing
trees?
we
have
exemptions
for
that
in
california
and
householders
and
--
they
all
have
different
purposes.
they
were
all
created
for
different
reasons.
and
we
have
to
consider
all
those
purposes
in
determining
whether
this
constitutional
amendment
has
some
reasonable
relationship
to
them.
if
it
doesn't
then
it
must
fall
in
violating
substantive
due
process.
it's
not
reasonably
related
to
some
legitimate,
legislative
objective.
but
even
if
we
just
consider
the
veteran's
exemption,
the
veteran's
exemption
was
created
in
1911.
justice
brennan
was
interested
in
this
yesterday
and
it
would
have
two
major
purposes.
one
was
it's
a
reward
for
past
honorable
service,
honorable
discharge
from
the
arm
forces.
and
secondly,
it
has
an
objective
in
assisting
veterans
who
presumably
have
lost
during
wartime
service
because
it's
limited
to
veterans
who
have
less
than
$5000
worth
of
property.
these
are
the
two
purposes
they
have
had.
it's
not
--
and
the
--
there
is
no
requirement
that
veterans
as
a
group
keep
up
a
pattern
of
good
moral
character.
the
--
the
character
is
established
when
they
got
their
honorable
discharge
just
as
it
is
for
bonuses.
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
not
commit
crimes,
felonies.
there's
nothing
at
all.
there's
no
disqualification
because
reward
for
past
service
and
because
trying
to
help
veterans
with
some
economic
assistance.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
amendment,
the
constitutional
amendment
was
set
out
in
the
argument
of
the
voters.
i'm
sorry
the
court
does
not
yet
have
the
arguments
of
the
voters.
i'll
leave
the
portions
of
it
applying
to
the
exemptions.
this
means
that
no
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
or
the
state
could
operate
as
a
charity
and
avoid
paying
taxes.
it
also
means
that
any
such
person
or
organization
would
not
be
entitled
to
certain
business
and
income
tax
exemptions.
this
will
have
the
effect
of
hitting
such
persons
or
organizations
in
the
pocket
book.
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
such
exemption
should
be
allowed
to
a
communist
and
the
like.
no
right
thinking
person
should
object
to
making
a
declaration
that
he's
not
a
communist
before
receiving
such
exemptions
from
the
state.
the
last
sentence
really
doesn't
apply
because
it
makes
no
provisions
for
such
a
declaration
but
this
is
the
reason.
it's
a
penalization,
it's
coercion,
it's
an
attempt
to
inhibit
advocacy
that
was
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
and
it's
the
real
reason.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
the
purposes
of
the
exemption.
it's
no
more
--
has
no
more
to
do
with
negating
the
purpose
of
the
church
exemption
and
raising
morality
or
the
veteran's
exemption
or
the
cemetery
exemption
has
no
--
no
relation
to
that
at
all.
its
sole
function
is
penalization
to
inhibit
free
speech.
now,
it's
true,
there've
been
cases
that
have
allowed
infringement
on
free
--
on
speech
as
incidental
effects.
the
douds
case
where
you
have
a
situation,
but
you
have
to
weigh
the
danger
to
the
country
from
interference
with
interstate
commerce
by
political
strikes.
there
are
government
employee
cases
but
none
of
those
were
aimed
at
the
advocacy.
they
were
aimed
at
setting
qualifications
because
there
was
a
sufficient
to
danger
to
warranty
infringement.
none
of
the
cases
in
which
you
had
situations
for
that
kind
have
allowed
infringements
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
qualification.
