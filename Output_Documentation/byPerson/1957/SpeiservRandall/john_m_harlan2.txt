--
that
the
majority
had
not
so
limited
the
statute
and
therefore,
as
he
read
the
majority
opinion
that
covered
advocacy
in
its
broad
sense
advocacy
of
abstract

one
of
his
criticisms.
justice
john
m.

didn't
say
you
have
to
read
it
that
way
in
order
to
escape
the
--
the
difficulties
that
your
adversary
brought.
