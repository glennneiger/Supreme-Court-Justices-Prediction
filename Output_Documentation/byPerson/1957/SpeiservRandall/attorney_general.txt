mr.
attorney
general
these
cases
involved
the
same
constitutional
provision,
article
20,
section
19
of
the
california
constitution
and
revenue
and
taxation
code
section
32.
the
issues
in
these
cases
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
preceding
cases
with
the
exception
that
it
does
not
involve
a
question
of
freedom
of
religion
or
establishment
of
religion
nor
is
there
an
organizational
question
involved.
we
are
dealing
with
a
privilege.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
we
aren't
saying
that
there
is
a
right
to
an
exemption
and
even
historically,
we
will
not
find
the
same
granting
of
exemption
for
veterans
in
this
area
as
it
has
been
granted
to
churches.
i
like
to
suggest
that
there's
a
classification
--
distinction
that
should
be
made
between
exemptions,
hence,
they
are
given
and
when
you
take
an
exemption
away.
for
example,
it
will
not
be
proper,
it
would
seem
to
me,
to
grant
an
exemption
of
any
kind
to
redheads,
republicans
or
adulterers.
but
if
you
grant
exemptions
to
the
general
public,
it
may
be
bad
and
it
would
be
bad
to
take
away
exemptions
or
to
exclude
from
exemptions
in
general,
redheads,
churches
with
red-headed
ministers
or
republicans
or
adulterers.
now,
i
am
basing
my
argument
on
a
broader
scale
than
the
preceding
counsel.
i
contend
that
we
do
have
an
issue,
the
constitutional
amendment.
we
have
it
in
issue
for
several
reasons.
we
have
it
in
issue
because
the
state
supreme
court
construed
it,
interpret
it
and
in
its
findings
on
free
speech
question,
it
was
talking
about
the
constitutional
amendment.
we
have
it
in
issue
because
the
state
supreme
court
said
it
was
self-executing.
it
was
mandatory.
it
was
prohibitory.
it
applied
to
all
exemptions
in
the
state.
and
it
--
and
it
said
that
revenue
and
taxation
code
section
32
was
merely
a
procedural
device.
mr.
attorney
general
excluded?
mr.
attorney
general
the
supreme
court,
the
state
supreme
court
indicated
that
it
was
left
out
for
administrative
difficulties.
mr.
attorney
general
too
many.
it
encompassed
too
many
people.
the
--
the
dissenter
suggested,
“well,
this
would
be
all
the
more
reason
for
including
them
if
you
were
concerned
with
the
--
protecting
some
vital
interest
of
the
state
that
you
would
want
to
extend
it
as
broad
as
possible.”
mr.
attorney
general
apparently
not.
now,
i
concede
to
the
fact
that
advocates
in
this
area
are
not
in
the
same
class
as
redheads
as
i
suggested.
but
in
determining
the
validity
of
this
and
the
purpose,
we
have
to
look
at
two
purposes.
one,
the
purpose
of
the
exemption,
it's
the
article
20,
the
constitutional
amendment
itself.
and
then
secondly,
we
have
to
consider
the
purposes
of
all
exemptions
and
see
whether
there
is
a
broad
overall
purpose.
now,
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
--
it
--
it
covers
specifically
all
words
that
have
existed
since
the
california
was
in
existence.
now,
i'm
not
sure
when
it
first
came
into
existence,
but
it
states
veterans
of
these
wars
and
it
--
it
goes
on
down
and
numbered
them
and
then
it's
amended
usually
to
include
new
words
as
--
as
the
situation
arises.
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
that
this
brief
is
plausible,
some
rather
broad
issues
in
the
time
remaining.
i
hope
to
try
to
pinpoint
four
issues.
one
is
the
form
of
the
oath,
second,
its
interpretation,
third,
the
substantive
evil
to
be
met
and
fourth,
the
place
for
the
interplay
of
state
action
and
the
exercise
of
the
powers
of
the
state
in
this
picture.
now,
first
in
regard
to
the
form
of
the
oath,
i'd
like
to
refer,
your
honors,
to
page
43
of
the
record
in
this
case
where
the
oath
is
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
an
exemplar
of
the
form.
i
merely
do
that
for
information.
i
just
like
to
make
a
point
now
very
briefly.
we
will
note
that
this
is
enclosed
as
part
of
an
oath
already
taken
that
under
california
law,
as
covered
in
page
59
of
our
brief,
an
affirmation
or
since
1957,
a
declaration
under
penalty
of
perjury
may
be
substituted.
as
i
point
out
in
the
same
place
in
our
brief,
the
burden
to
obtain
a
tax
exemption
like
this
is
on
the
taxpayer.
on
that
page,
i
cite
what
should
be
section
260,
260
of
the
revenue
taxation
code
in
the
state
of
california
which
provides
that
burden
and
which
provides
for
waiver
in
the
absence
of
the
execution
of
the
oath
required.
this
is
more
fully
covered
on
pages
59
and
61
of
the
brief.
secondly,
in
regard
to
the
interpretation
of
the
oath
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
now,
that
that
is
my
second
point,
your
honor.
as
i
read
the
holding
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
this
case,
particularly
in
page
53
of
the
record
in
the
unitarian
church
case,
the
--
in
first
referring
to
the
dennis
case,
the
court
says
the
dennis
case
involved
the
validity
of
the
smith
act
which
prohibited
and
made
criminal
the
advocacy
of
the
activities
announced
by
the
people
of
the
state
and
its
constitution.
in
other
words,
it
refers
to
the
same
activity
which
prohibited
and
made
criminal
the
activity,
the
advocacy
of
the
activities
denounced
by
the
people
of
the
state
and
its
constitution.
if
we
skip
the
quotation
from
the
dennis
case,
later
on,
we
note
that
the
court
states
in
the
present
case,
the
constitutional
provision
is
concerned
with
those
who
advocate
the
same
prohibited
activity.
i
think
probably
that
we
should
be
able
to
take
the
california
supreme
court
and
its
word.
now,
my
point
would
be
that
in
the
yates
case,
in
the
dennis
case,
in
the
garner
case,
the
douds
case,
the
adler
case
and
the
gerende
case,
in
each
of
those
cases,
this
court
was
faced
with
a
problem
of
an
oath
governing
advocacy.
in
many
cases,
the
forms
of
the
oath
were
brought
that
they
covered
other
types
of
conduct
besides
such
as
advising
and
in
teaching.
my
point
is
the
court
has
always
emphasized
that
each
of
these
particular
provisions
calls
for
interpretation
that
it
must
be
construed
as
interpreted
by
the
state
court.
i
contend
on
the
basis
of
this
language
that
the
state
court
has
given
it
such
interpretation.
mr.
attorney
general
that
it
covers
the
advocacy
of
conduct
for
violent
overthrow.
in
other
words,
the
advocacy
of
conduct,
productive
of
violent
overthrow.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
precisely.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
that's
the
way
i
read
it
and
that's
the
way
i
think
that
we
can
fairly
state
that
the
court
read
it.
and
i
believe
that
this
court
in
prior
cases
particularly,
in
the
garner
case
and
in
the
gerende
case
has
taken
the
provision
as
narrowed
by
the
state.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
i
did,
on
page
53,
your
honor.
also
on
page
47,
they
referred
to
advocacy
as
being
action
and
the
instigation
of
action
and
they
fight
to
get
location
in
that
regard
which,
of
course,
this
court
relied
on
in
drawing
the
line
in
the
--
in
regard
to
the
smith
act.
in
other
words,
this
act
isn't
--
no
broader.
in
fact,
it's
in
narrower
terms
in
regard
to
advocacy
than
those
other
provisions
concerned
in
those
cases.
now,
in
regard
to
the
point
in
the
--
of
the
possible
--
mr.
attorney
general
surely.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
i'm
saying
that
in
the
dennis
case,
your
honor,
this
court
was
concerned
with
criminal
conduct.
and,
of
course,
there
is
the
same
need
for
a
fair
notice
in
advance
as
a
written
regard
to
the
oath
and
i'm
saying
that
the
court
in
those
cases
read
the
statutes
in
a
narrow
fashion
as
we've
contended
they
should
be
read
throughout
our
brief
and
i'm
contending
that
i
believe
there
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statement
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
i'm
--
i
also
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
now
that
is
--
i'm,
of
course,
is
first
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
believe
that
this
court
treated
that
problem
in
the
garner
and
to
some
extent
in
the
adler
cases
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
garner
case,
they
upheld
that.
in
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
arguments
made
as
you'll
note
in
the
brochure
of
the
voters.
that
was
picked
out
specifically.
i
would
say
this,
that
if
i
were
asked
to
construe
it,
i
would
say
that
other
unlawful
means,
means
other
unlawful
means
in
the
nature
of
force
or
violence.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
however,
i
mean
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
i
think
there
is
a
different
problem.
as
i
see
it,
this
court
has
not
specifically
construed
that
language
by
itself,
nor
has
the
california
supreme
court.
now,
there
have
been
cases
which
construed
probably
a
broader
language
like
this
court
did
in
williams
versus
united
states
in
regard
to
the
civil
rights
acts
in
the
regard
to
the
language
says
that
to
depriving
any
person
of
any
rights
given
under
the
constitution
or
statutes
of
the
united
states.
and
this
court
held
there
that
this
statute
could
be
applied
as
properly
construed.
also,
i
want
to
point
out
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
old
case
of
people
versus
steelik
187
cal.361
and
also
203
p.78
did
construe
the
problem
of
what
crime
meant.
and
they
held
in
that
case
that
crime
referred
to
crime
as
exists
under
california
law
and,
of
course,
in
california
we
do
have
statutory
crimes
under
our
penal
code.
so,
therefore,
i
believe,
your
honor,
there
is
a
basis
for
construing
other
unlawful
means,
although
i
will
admit
to
your
honors,
that
the
--
it
has
not
been
specifically
construed
although
it
has
been
covered
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly,
in
garner.
now,
in
regard
to
the
fair
notice
rule,
i
just
like
to
advert,
your
honors,
--
oh,
wait.
may
i
have
five
minutes
more
and
my
time
is
up,
please,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
attorney
general
fine,
thank
you.
in
regard
to
the
notice,
i'd
like
to
point
particularly
to
some
other
cases
particularly
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
beauharnais
versus
illinois,
the
united
states
versus
harrison,
united
states
versus
petrillo
where
it
states
the
essence,
its
fair
notice
to
the
person
affected.
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
there
is
fair
notice
here
in
regard
to
other
unlawful
means.
now,
in
regard
to
the
problem
of
severability
which
was
raised
by
this
court
yesterday,
i'd
like
to
advert
specifically
to
page
50
in
my
brief
where
we
find
revenue
and
taxation
code
section
26
which
i
contend
first
is
the
rule
of
severability
for
this
particular
oath.
mr.
attorney
general
page
50
of
our
brief.
it's
--
it's
at
the
very
--
very
bottom
of
the
page.
i
contend
that
this
statute
besides
the
fact
of
the
--
of
the
fourth
provision
itself
allows
complete
severability
as
between
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means
or
the
question
of
support.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
it's
likewise
severable.
it's
--
it's
phrase
in
the
same
term.
in
other
words,
the
drafting
of
the
constitution
with
the
succession
of
the
word
or,
or,
or
suggests
to
me
the
idea
of
severability.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
mean
since
the
oath
was
required,
hereunder,
the
particular
statutory
provision,
it
seems
to
me
like
that
would
dispose
of
this
case.
now,
of
course,
if
this
court
were
to
hold,
that
a
certain
part
of
the
state
constitution
were
invalid,
i
imagine
that
would
be
probably
dispose
of
the
matter.
in
other
words,
i
--
i
take
it
we
would
not
attempt
to
enforce
the
law.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
on
the
basis,
your
honor,
that
the
people
were
attempting
and
here
gets
the
basic
state
purpose
which
i
probably
will
not
have
time
to
advert
to.
they
are
attempting
to
secure
--
mr.
attorney
general
fine,
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
the
--
i
want
to
say
that
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
people
of
the
state
was
to
attempt
to
satisfy
in
their
--
a
--
a
declaration
to
that
effect
on
page
42
of
our
brief
--
in
statute
i
might
say,
that
the
attempt
of
the
people
with
the
state
was
to
try
to
prevent
the
use
of
an
exemption,
in
this
case,
an
exemption
given
for
patriotic
purposes
and
to
stimulate
patriotism
that
they
are
trying
to
prevent
the
use
of
that
exemption
to
subsidize
people
whose
particular
narrow
conduct
that's
defined
in
this
oath
did
not
comport
with
the
purpose
of
the
exemption.
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
people
of
the
state
would
be
served,
if
you
were
to
read
and
leave
the
oath
merely
as
referring
to
force
or
violence
or
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
the
state
purpose
which
the
people
of
the
state
sought
to
provoke
by
this
enactment,
in
which
they
sought
to
attain
as
a
state
purpose.
i
believe
that
that
would
be
satisfied
by
such
a
construction.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
the
basis
i
mean
that
there
is
an
independent
purpose
to
--
to
reach
that
particular
narrow,
limited
kind
of
speech.
in
other
words,
that's
the
kind
of
speech
covered
the
smith
act.
that's
the
kind
of
speech
covered
in
many
other
enactments
which
have
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
by
other
courts
including
the
california
supreme
court.
so,
therefore,
i
think
we
can
say
there
is
an
independent
public
purpose
even
on
as
limited
or
reading
of
the
provision
as
that
and
that
applies
to
i
think
both
to
the
statute
and
to
the
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general
i
have
nothing
further
to
add,
but
if
the
court
has
any
questions,
(inaudible)
