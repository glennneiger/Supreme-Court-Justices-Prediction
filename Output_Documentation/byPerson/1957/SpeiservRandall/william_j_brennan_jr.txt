william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
has
it
been
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
attach
what
would
you
call
an
unconstitutional
conditions
and
privilege
suspended
by
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
mcclure
this
was
--
those
taxpayers
do
who
looks
at
this
thing
and
he
has
to
ask
himself,
do
i
have
the
term,
belief
and
--
or
do
i
have
--
if
they'd
to
overthrow
the
government
by
a
force
and
violence.
other
people
determine
for
themselves
whether
they
advocate.
i
don't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
he
decide
for
himself
based
on
what,
conscience
it
is
or
what
he
believes
to
himself
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
at
least
he
had
to
say
to
himself,
“well,
i
advocate
that
i
can
agree
with
myself
as
i
advocate
to
overthrow
if
i
have
made
speeches
about
it,
if
i
have
written
to
that
effect.”
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
he
--
he
would
not
--
if
he
able
--
even
though
he
believe
to
himself,
he
hasn't
made
any
open
expression
or
any
word,
although
he
might
personally
believe
in
--
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
he
could
truthfully
sign
this
unless
if
all
he
did
was
believe
it
and
has
never
done
anything
about
it.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
could
truthfully
sign
it
if
he
merely
made
speeches
about
it
but
not
--
the
only
time
he
couldn't
truthfully
sign
it
was
the
--
more
than
like
speeches
about
it.
he
attempted
by
the
speeches
or
otherwise
to
incite
people
to
overthrow,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
just
has
to
the
answer
that
single
question
for
himself,
“do
i
do
things
about
this
which
have
for
their
purpose
inciting
other
people
to
overthrow
and
if
i
don't
i
can
truthfully
sign
it.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
a
taxpayer
was
a
file
which
you
were
discussing,
a
state
in
which
he
said
that
i
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence
and
i
talk
about
that
with
my
friends.
would
you
allow
him,
the
exemption
if
he
signed
that
the
statement
saying
in
addition
all
i
mean
when
i
signed
this
is
to
say
that
when
i
talk
about
it,
i'm
not
trying
to
incite
anybody
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
he
says
i
signed
it
because
that's
what
i
understand
that
means.
but
nevertheless,
i
believe
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
indeed
in
my
--
among
my
friends
i
talk
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
say
that
again,
mr.
mcclure,
what
does
it
mean?
support
for
means
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
support
of
a
foreign
government
in
the
event
of
hostilities
is
the
language,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
apply
this
to
other
unlawful
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
severability,
the
constitutional
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
you
can't
rely
on
this
provision
of
the
taxation
code
to
support
you
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
severable,
can
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
question
is
if
we
have
to
reach
the
validity
of
a
state
constitution
provision,
on
what
basis
are
we
disposed
of
that
provision
is
severable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
has
a
hypothesis
at
all
and
they
made
in
review
about
it.
if
we
had
to
say
that
other
unlawful
means
had
to
fall
and
that
support
of
a
foreign
power
in
the
event
of
hostility
set
for.
is
there
any
basis
upon
which
we
could
view
the
constitutional
provision
that's
severable
so
that
the
advocacy
of
overthrow
by
force
and
violence
could
stand?
