mr.
william
f.
walsh
may
it
please
the
court.
the
conviction
in
this
case
depends
solely
upon
the
admissibility
of
evidence
ceased
from
the
petitioner
during
an
arrest
by
a
federal
agent
executing
a
federal
warrant
of
arrest.
there
are
three
issues
before
the
court.
one,
whether
the
warrant
was
properly
issued
and
could
support
a
valid
arrest,
two,
whether
the
petitioner
waived
is
right
to
object
to
the
validity
of
the
arrest
when
he
waived
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
united
states
commissioner,
and
three,
whether
the
government
may
now
rely
upon
state
law
to
sustain
this
conviction.
i'm
going
to
go
into
that
in
a
little
more
detail
later
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
under
state
law
in
texas,
this
arrest
would
not
have
been
lawful
under
the
applicable
state
statutes
where
--
as
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
and
the
cases
which
we
have
filed
in
our
reply
brief
so
state.
the
facts
are
these.
a
federal
narcotics
agent
named
finley
had
been
investigating
the
petitioner.
mr.
finley
testified
that
he
had
heard
that
the
petitioner
was
going
to
chicago
to
obtain
some
heroin
and
that
he
had
heard
also
that
the
petitioner
was
back
in
houston
with
the
heroin.
he
said
that
he
had
been
watching
the
petitioner
since
before
christmas
of
1955
and
that
his
surveillance
corroborated
his
information
to
the
extent
that
giordenello
did
go
to
chicago
and
did
return
to
houston.
mr.
finley
admitted
at
the
--
the
hearing
on
this
matter
that
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
that
the
petitioner
committed
any
crime.
he
said
that
he
had
not
seen
him
with
narcotics
in
his
possession.
he
said
that
he
had
never
seen
him
with
heroin
and
that
during
the
entire
time
he
had
been
following
the
accused,
he
had
never
seen
him
violate
any
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
nevertheless,
mr.
finley
saw
fit
to
go
before
united
states
commissioner
in
houston
and
filed
a
complaint
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
21
u.s.c.
174.
it
simply
alleged
that
veto
giordenello
did
receive,
conceal
et
cetera
narcotic
drugs
to
with
heroin
hydrochloride
with
knowledge
of
unlawful
importation.
no
facts
were
stated
in
that
complaint.
mr.
finely
did
not
reveal
in
that
complaint
why
he
thought
that
the
petitioner
had
received,
concealed,
et
cetera,
heroin
hydrochloride
or
anything
else.
obtaining
a
warrant
on
the
strength
of
this
complaint,
finley
followed
the
petitioner
for
two
days.
he
obtained
it
on
the
26th
of
january,
1956
and
shadowed
the
petitioner
until
the
following
day
the
27th.
when
he
saw
him
coming
out
of
a
garage
with
a
paper
bag
in
his
hand,
and
he
at
that
time
executed
the
warrant
of
arrest.
he
claimed
that
he
did
not
obtain
the
warrant
simply,
they
have
an
excuse
for
arresting
the
accused
but
he
also
claimed
that
there
was
no
particular
reason
to
execute
the
warrant
at
any
particular
moment
or
time
after
obtaining
it.
now,
the
petitioner
was
given
an
opportunity
to
have
a
preliminary
hearing
the
following
day,
the
28th
of
january.
he
had
an
attorney
present
with
him
at
the
u.s.
commissioner's
office
and
he
waived
preliminary
hearing.
the
attorney
who
represented
him
or
who
accompanied
him
at
that
hearing
has
not
appeared
again
in
this
case.
he
is
out
of
the
picture
as
of
the
moment
that
preliminary
hearing
was
waived.
he
did
not
represent
giordenello
at
the
trial
or
on
the
appeals
of
this
case.
giordenello
was
later
indicted
not
for
the
offense
for
which
he
was
arrested,
the
violation
of
21
u.s.c.
174
but
for
the
revenue
offense
of
purchasing
narcotics
without
the
appropriate
tax-paid
stamps.
shortly
after
the
indictment
was
returned,
the
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
ceased
during
the
arrest.
the
government
filed
no
answer
to
that
motion.
a
hearing
was
held
before
the
trial
judge
at
which
mr.
finley
testified
as
a
witness
called
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
finely
recounted
substantially
the
facts
which
i
have
recounted
to
you.
as
i
say,
the
government
did
not
file
any
answer
to
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
waiver
position
that
the
court
below
took,
i
don't
think
the
government
is
now
in
a
position
to
sustain
this
conviction
if
it
did
not
in
the
trial
court
endeavor
to
establish
a
waiver.
no
argument
was
made
in
this
--
this
--
i
was
going
to
go
into
this
little
further.
no
argument
was
made
by
the
government
on
trial
that
petitioner
waived
anything
when
he
waived
the
preliminary
hearing.
now,
the
contention
that
there
was
a
waiver
in
this
case
arose
for
the
first
time
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
sure
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
do
for
this
reason.
we
are
discussing
his
waiver
of
preliminary
hearing
based
solely
upon
an
entry
in
the
commissioner's
docket
which
was
entered
into
evidence
for
other
purposes
at
the
trial.
if
a
man
can
waive
a
preliminary
--
waive
the
right
to
suppress
evidence
by
virtue
of
waiving
a
preliminary
hearing
and
i
don't
think
he
can.
but
if
he
can,
i
think
it
deserves
more
explanation
than
we
have
here.
i
think
he
should
have
a
right
to
contest
for
instance
whether
he
was
adequately
advised
by
counsel,
whether
counsel
was
there
representing
him
or
was
just
standing
by.
all
of
those
things
i
think
would
require
more
proof
than
in
this
record
although
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
--
and
i'll
develop
this
for
the
later.
i
don't
think
waiver
of
preliminary
hearing
can
be
waiver
of
the
right
to
object
to
an
unlawful
arrest.
the
trial
judge
overruled
the
motion
to
suppress
without
stating
his
reasons.
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
and
virtually,
the
same
testimony
was
elicited
by
the
government
on
trial
that
had
been
elicited
by
the
defense
at
the
pretrial
motion.
at
the
trial,
the
united
states
attorney
succeeded
over
the
objection
of
the
defense
in
getting
the
trial
judge
to
take
judicial
notice
that
this
was
an
arrest
based
on
a
complaint
and
warrant.
and
i
think
that's
significant
too
in
view
of
the
government's
suggestion
today
that
in
--
in
the
government's
brief,
that
somehow
this
case
could
be
sustained
as
though
it
were
a
--
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
made
under
state
law.
i
think
by
taking
that
strong
opposition
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court
to
the
extent
of
having
the
judge
take
judicial
notice
that
the
government
cannot
now
change
the
issues
to
the
extent
that
would
be
necessary
to
sustain
the
conviction
on
those
grounds.
now,
i'd
like
to
discuss
first
the
validity
of
these
complaints.
you'll
find
the
complaint,
i
believe
at
page
15
in
the
record.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
complaint
simply
alleges
the
commission
of
an
offense
in
the
language
of
a
statute.
it
has
been
our
position
that
such
a
complaint
is
--
is
insufficient,
and
we've
cited
considerable
authority
in
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
an
affidavit
for
a
warrant
must
state
facts
as
distinguished
from
conclusions
of
law.
the
government's
position
is
that
since
the
language
in
the
indictment
of
the
statute
is
sufficient,
a
complaint
should
be
too.
and
i
say
that
this
ignores
the
functional
and
constitutional
differences
between
an
indictment
and
a
complaint.
the
--
the
purpose
of
these
two
pleadings
is
entirely
different.
the
indictment
is
evidence
of
nothing,
it
is
merely
an
accusation.
it
is
an
expression
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
be
advised
of
the
nature
of
the
charge.
its
purpose
is
only
to
put
a
man
on
notice
of
what
it
is
he
is
accused
of
doing.
the
rule
3
complaint
is
a
different
kettle
of
fish
entirely.
the
rule
3
complaint
is
the
constitutional
affidavit
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
in
the
case
of
a
complaint
on
which
a
warrant
is
issued,
the
complaint
itself
is
evidence.
the
complaint
is
the
basis
for
the
magistrate's
decision
to
issue
a
warrant.
it's
the
only
basis
he
has.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
the
present
situation
is
simply
that
mr.
finley,
the
narcotics
agent,
was
allowed
to
determine
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
issue
a
warrant
rather
than
the
magistrate.
the
magistrate
never
knew
he
accepted
mr.
finley's
legal
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
did
receive,
conceal,
et
cetera
narcotic
drugs,
to
wit.
the
magistrate
completely
advocated
from
his
function
of
deciding
whether
there
is
a
probable
cause
to
the
arrest,
and
that
after
all
is
why
we
have
the
magistrate.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
you
have
this,
sir.
in
the
case
of
an
arrest
under
an
indictment,
that
is
a
warrant
issuing
upon
an
indictment,
you
at
least
have
the
determination
of
the
grand
jury
that
probable
cause
exists.
you
have
someone
intervening
between
the
policeman
and
the
citizen.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
--
the
point
is
that
it's
not
the
--
the
advice
portion
of
it.
the
purpose
of
the
indictment
and
the
purpose
of
the
complaint
are
completely
different.
the
indictments,
you
have
the
--
the
grand
jury
which
has
heard
the
evidence
and
some
responsible
body
had
determined
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
bring
the
man
to
trial.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
your
honor.
i
sure
do.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
would
hesitate,
your
honor,
to
speculate
as
to
what
the
overall
federal
practice
is.
i
think
the
case
has
clearly
established
that
if
that
warrant
is
to
be
valid,
the
complaint
must
actually
set
out
the
evidentiary
basis
upon
which
the
officer
desires
to
make
an
arrest
so
that
the
magistrate
from
reading
the
complaint,
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause.
this
completely
short
circuits
the
magistrate.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
now,
we've
cited
quite
a
few
cases
in
our
brief
to
that
affect
that
--
and
have
an
appendix
of
--
of
cases
which
discusses
that
at
some
length.
the
court
will
see
two
complaints
in
--
in
steele
versus
united
states
in
the
267
u.s.
and
in
dumbra
verus
united
states
in
the
268
u.s.
we'll
see
two
complaints
which
the
court
has
approved
as
being
sufficient
and
they
are
both
quite
detailed
as
to
their
analysis
of
the
facts.
if
finley
really
knew
the
things
which
he
said
he
knew
at
the
time
he
obtained
that
warrant,
he
could
easily
have
stated
them
in
the
complaint
and
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
in
the
complaints,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
exactly.
if
he
knew
those
things,
we
would
have
an
entirely
--
in
our
brief,
we
go
into
the
question
also
of
whether
you
can
get
a
warrant
at
all
based
on
personal
knowledge.
but
actually,
it
isn't
necessary
to
develop
that
fully
in
order
to
refer
to
this
case
because
mr.
finley
didn't
even
tell
us
hearsay
to
the
magistrate.
if
he
had
filed
a
complaint
saying,
“i've
heard
that
veto
giordenello
was
going
to
chicago
to
buy
heroin
and
i
know
that
he's
gone
up
there
and
he's
come
back,"
and
so
on,
then
we
would
have
a
case
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
hearsay
was
sufficient
nor
to
authorize
the
issuance
of
a
warrant.
but
here,
mr.
finley
did
not
even
give
his
scanty
information
such
as
it
was
to
the
magistrate.
and
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
the
cases
hold
that
the
complaint
is
--
must
be
self-sufficient
and
--
and
cannot
be
bolstered
up
by
oral
testimony.
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
waiver
aspect
of
this
case
briefly.
as
i
say
the
waiver
question
was
raised
first
by
--
in
the
fifth
circuit
by
the
government.
i
think
it's
extremely
significant
that
giordenello
was
not
--
and
to
this
day,
has
not
been
charged
or
indicted
or
tried
or
anything
for
the
offense
for
which
he
was
arrested.
to
this
day,
no
indictment
has
been
filed
under
that
violation
of
21
u.s.c.
174,
and
yet
they
are
--
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
petitioner's
actions
in
a
case
completely
unrelated
to
the
--
at
least
legally
unrelated
to
the
case
which
you
are
now
reviewing,
should
in
some
way
control
this
case.
i
don't
think
that's
proper.
i
think
in
any
event,
a
man
ought
to
have
a
right
to
decide
in
a
particular
case
what
--
what
it
is
he
wants
to
do
without
committing
himself
as
to
all
future
cases.
and
let
me
observe
that
there
is
pending
in
this
court
as
number
515
miscellaneous
a
conspiracy
case
involving
the
same
evidence,
it
was
used
again
as
evidence
in
a
--
an
indictment
returned
almost
six
months
after
the
arrest.
now,
can
it
fairly
be
said
that
a
man
is
making
a
knowing
intelligent
waiver
of
anything
when
he
is
not
even
charged
with
the
crime
at
which
the
evidence
is
to
be
used,
i
don't
think
so.
the
--
i
--
i
think
even
if
he
were
tried
for
the
offense
which
--
for
which
he
was
allegedly
arrested,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
waiver
of
preliminary
hearing
can
amount
to
consent
to
an
arrest.
the
government
is
actually
asking
you
to
take
that
position.
they
are
saying,
“by
waiving
preliminary
hearing,
petitioner
in
effect
admitted
through
counsel
that
finley
did
have
sufficient
basis
to
arrest
him.”
now,
i
think
that's
a
pretty
extreme
view
and
it's
going
to
have
the
considerable
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
courts
if
you
agree
with
it.
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
a
large
number
of
these
hearings
are
waived.
it
is
very
seldom
that
counsel
who
tries
a
case
is
in
on
it
in
time
to
represent
a
man
the
day
after
the
arrest.
if
for
no
other
reason,
it
usually
takes
a
man
time
to
get
a
fee
together.
if
we
hold
the
man,
the
waivers
made
at
these
preliminary
hearings,
everybody
will
have
to
demand
a
preliminary
hearing
and
go
through
the
whole
business
and
try
his
case
twice.
and
that
is
going
to
tie
up
united
states
commissioners
all
over
the
country.
furthermore
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
personally
don't
waive
hearings,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
your
honor,
but
they
are
waived
primarily.
and
as
a
general
rule
by
people
who
simply
want
to
have
their
bails
set
and
get
out,
they
are
able
to
make
their
bail
and
they
just
don't
want
to
stay
in
and
fool
around
when
they
think
they
have
a
trial
coming
up.
if
you
affirm
this
case,
he
isn't
going
to
have
the
trial
coming
up.
there
are
number
of
--
the
whole
thing
really
been
decided
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
he
would
have
committed
himself
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
and
i
don't
how
far
the
government
is
asking
you
to
carry
that
through,
your
honor.
you
get
into
a
lot
of
other
questions,
what
if
a
man
comes
without
counsel
and
the
u.s.
commissioner
advices
him
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
and
he
waives
counsel
and
says
--
go
ahead
let's
set
the
bond,
and
waives
the
whole
preliminary
hearing
himself
has
he
then
waived
everything
which
a
lawyer
could
have
done
if
a
lawyer
had
been
there?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
on
the
question
of
waiver?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
the
state
of
the
law
is
this,
your
honor.
there
are
not
more
than
four
or
five
cases
dealing
with
this
question.
one
of
them
is
united
states
versus
walker
which
is
cited,
it's
in
our
brief,
the
197
f.2d
and
decided
in
all
of
our
briefs.
walker
was
a
collateral
attack
but
the
court
was
not
directly
considering
his
problem.
they
held
that
when
the
man
waived
preliminary
--
actually,
it
was
a
removal
proceeding
that
he
waived.
now,
that
is
patently
wrong.
rule
41(e)
clearly
provides
the
man
may
make
a
motion
to
suppress
either
in
the
district
court
in
which
he
is
arrested
or
the
court
in
which
trial
is
to
be
held.
and
clearly,
the
walker
case
is
--
simply,
it
doesn't
mention
rule
41(e)
at
all
and
--
and
takes
no
account
of
it.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
was
too,
your
honor.
the
---
the
only
case
that
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
--
we
have
here
what
i
think
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
united
states
versus
--
i
believe
it's
pronounced
(inaudible)
which
again
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
i
believe
the
government
cited
it.
that
case
holds
that
by
waiving
preliminary
hearing,
you
do
waive
such
technical
defects
as
spelling
of
names
and
things
like
that.
now,
it
is
my
position
that
this
is
not
just
a
technicality.
here
in
--
the
defect
in
this
warrant
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
our
system
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
judge
hand,
writing
that
opinion,
says
that
the
petitioner
is
waiving
only
formalities.
by
waiving
the
preliminary
hearing,
he's
simply
waiving
the
right
to
have
a
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor,
it
sure
is.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
as
i
say,
there
aren't
many
cases
on
this,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
walker
and
(inaudible)
are
the
only
two
that
that
deal
directly
with
this
thing
that
i've
been
able
to
find
in
my
research.
the
question
of
state
law
raised
by
the
government
for
the
first
time
here,
there
is
a
statute
in
texas
which
purports
to
allow
narcotics
officers
to
make
such
as
for
contraband.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
--
i
disagree
with
it,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
--
but
it's
--
it's
really
not
necessary
to
develop
it
for
this
case
because
the
texas
case
has
clearly
established
that
under
texas
law,
this
would
be
an
unlawful
arrest.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
it
was
decided
in
di
re
and
johnson
only
that
for
the
purpose
of
evidence
which
in
existence
in
the
hands
of
a
state
police
officer.
in
testing
its
--
it's
admissibility
in
the
federal
courts
if
used
there,
we
would
apply
the
state
standards.
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
state
may
enlarge
the
powers
of
a
federal
officer
or
that
a
federal
officer's
--
pardon
i
--
as
a
matter
fact
claimed
that
under
di
re
versus
united
states,
the
federal
officer's
job
is
to
follow
the
federal
rules
and
--
and
he
is
not
entitled.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
you
have
it
slightly,
your
honor.
i
--
i
feel
that
all
that
case
decides
is
that
evidence
ceased
by
a
state
policeman
will
be
tested
according
the
state
standards.
but
here
in
effect,
we
have
a
federal
statute.
we
have
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
the
texas
law
i
think
is
with
me.
i
cited
two
cases
in
the
reply
brief
which
i
filed,
giacona
versus
state
and
harper
versus
state,
page
2
in
the
reply
brief.
giocona
is
a
paper
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
sir,
i
--
i
don't
think
this
arrest
could
be
justified
under
anybody's
standards.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
giocona
versus
state
is
a
brown
paper
bag
case
which
gets
about
as
close
to
this
one
as
you
can.
rosie
giacona
was
sitting
in
an
automobile
with
a
brown
paper
bag
in
her
hand
and
officers
were
making
an
arrest
of
another
person
in
the
car
with
her.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
she
herself
must
commit
some
act
in
their
presence
in
order
to
make
the
arrest
lawful
no
matter
how
much
information
they
had
about
her.
and
the
pee
wee--harper
case
is
the
same
thing.
now,
there
was
no
act
on
the
part
of
this
defendant,
in
mr.
finley's
presence.
mr.
finley
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
was
in
the
paper
bag.
and
i
--
i
believe
that
the
harper
and
giacona
cases
will
satisfy
the
court
that
state
law
does
not
authorize
this
arrest.
i
think
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
have
only
six
minutes
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
if
you
impose
upon
the
petitioner
the
waiver
which
the
government
asks
you
to
do,
you
will
be
creating
a
new
kind
of
waiver.
you
will
be
creating
a
waiver
in
the
very
inception
of
the
criminal
prosecution
which
--
from
which
relief
can
in
no
way
ever
be
granted.
in
the
companion
case,
the
government
has
--
has
confessed
error
in
the
case
and
has
admitted
that
where
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress
is
actually
held
that
this
constitutes
relief
from
the
waiver.
and
you'll
find
that
in
the
government's
memorandum
in
the
indiviglio
and
diaz
case.
here,
a
hearing
was
held.
the
judge
went
ahead
and
ruled.
he
heard
all
the
evidence,
he
went
ahead
and
--
and
ruled
on
the
question.
and
i
don't
think
it's
fair
and
i
don't
think
it's
right
to
insist
to
the
man
on
the
very
day
after
he's
arrested
be
aware
of
all
this
legal
--
his
legal
positions.
if
--
if
he
had
demanded
a
preliminary
hearing,
you
still
wouldn't
have
any
more
of
the
records
than
you
have
right
here
because
those
preliminary
hearings
aren't
reported.
all
you
would
have
is
a
notation
on
the
docket
where
it
says
"waived
hearing"
you'd
have
a
notation
saying
?hearing
held.
and
the
u.s.
commissioners,
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
had
no
--
there
was
no
relief
that
the
u.s.
commissioner
could
give
a
petitioner
that
would
be
meaningful
and
--
and
binding
on
anyone.
if
he
let
the
petitioner
go,
the
petitioner
could
still
be
rearrested.
the
commissioner's
decision
is
not
res
judicata,
it
doesn't
bind
anyone.
and
i
--
i
feel
that
a
waiver
should
not
be
imposed
upon
a
person
until
he
is
in
a
court
or
a
place
where
he
has
to
take
action
in
order
to
get
affirmative
binding
relief.
in
connection
with
the
state
practice,
i
--
i
--
i
feel
that
it
is
almost
unfair
to
plunge
the
court
into
the
law
of
texas
because
this
can
become
even
more
complicated
than
i
think
the
solicitor
general
understands.
we
held,
for
instance,
in
texas
a
statute
article
727
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
that
statute
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs
by
the
way,
which
provides
that
any
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
laws
or
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
not
admissible
in
the
state
courts.
and
i
think
the
provisions
of
the
texas
narcotic
act
have
to
be
considered
in
turn
with
the
criminal
procedure
statute
which
adopts
all
of
the
federal
rules.
the
government
said,
and
i
think
significantly,
we
rely
upon
walker.
the
counsel
said
that
twice.
and
i
would
like
the
court
to
look
at
the
walker
case
in
conjunction
with
all
of
the
other
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
the
walker
case
is
a
freak.
the
walker
case
was
a
--
a
collateral
attack
by
way
of
coram
nobis
on
a
conviction.
and
the
court
went
on
to
hold
originally
that
the
man
had
no
right
to
challenge
the
legality
of
his
arrest
in
a
collateral
attack.
walker,
where
it
says
that
this
type
of
complaint
is
sufficient,
relies
solely
on
rice
versus
ames,
the
supreme
court
decision
on
the
180th
u.s.
rice
versus
ames
is
a
foreign
extradition
case.
and
the
court
explicitly
held
that
it
was
departing
from
the
rules
that
are
normally
applied
in
criminal
cases
because
of
the
difficulties
of
bringing
witnesses
to
this
country
from
foreign
lands
to
testify
in
connection
with
extradition
proceedings.
with
the
exception
of
those
cases,
all
of
the
law
is
that
this
type
of
complaint
is
insufficient.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
exactly,
your
honor.
and
you
will
find
that
all
of
the
other
authority
is
--
is
our
way.
this
is
a
historical
thing.
the
government
says,
well,
if
essential
facts
means
one
thing
in
rule
7,
it
must
mean
the
same
in
rule
3.
that
is
not
so.
the
constitutional
affidavit
required
by
the
fourth
amendment
goes
back
to
the
--
the
days
of
the
writs
of
assistance
in
james
otis
in
1761.
there
is
plenty
of
reason
for
construing
those
things
differently.
they're
intended
to
do
different
things.
and
they
are
historically
foreign
to
each
other.
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
of
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
question
about
what
is
the
federal
practice.
i
don't
know
what
the
federal
practice
is
generally,
but
i
do
know
that
every
court
with
the
exception
of
the
walker
court
that
has
encountered
this
kind
of
case
has
reversed
it.
and
i
know
further
that
the
reason
you
don't
have
so
many
cases,
i
will
--
i
will
assume
that
the
government
is
in
practice
violating
the
constitution
by
filing
insufficient
warrants.
but
the
reason
you
don't
have
a
lot
of
cases
based
on
that
is
that
it
only
makes
a
difference
if
the
man
is
caught
for
something.
otherwise,
he
might
just
as
well
--
he's
got
no
purpose
to
challenge
the
arrest.
what
--
what
difference
does
it
make
to
him?
he
might
just
as
well
let
the
proceedings
go
on
and
be
indicted
and
defend
himself.
he
doesn't
have
to
challenge
the
initial
process
which
brought
him
to
the
bar
of
justice.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
i'm
--
i'm
sure
it's
comparatively
rare
that
the
government
is
successful
as
they
were
here
in
catching
the
man
because
that
is
a
comparatively
rare
situation,
you
don't
have
many
cases.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
practice
which
i
believe
to
be
violative
of
the
constitution
should
be
encouraged.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
you
will
find
it
in
appendix
a
on
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
you
will
find
them
in
appendix
a.
i
cite
six
or
seven
cases
which
--
going
to
some
reasoning
on
it
and
some
of
them
deal
with
complaints
that
are
exactly
like
this
one.
furthermore,
you
will
find
more
cases
to
this
point
on
pages
14,
15,
and
16
of
the
brief.
i
--
i
particularly
like
mr.
justice
bradley's
memorandum
in
re
rule
of
court
where
he
was
sitting
as
a
circuit
justice
of
federal
case
number
12126
cited
on
page
15.
you
will
see
his
reasoning
--
he
goes
on
at
some
length
on
why
it
is
necessary
to
actually
have
a
witness
before
the
commissioner
and
to
give
the
commissioner
the
facts
or
the
magistrate.
and
of
course,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
cases
although
that
the
--
that
the
affidavit
must
be
self-sufficient
that's
the
purpose
of
it.
now,
it
might
be
permissible
to
attach
more
affidavits
to
it
but
the
point
is
that
we
are
not
expected
to
rely
on
oral
communications
between
the
officer
and
the
magistrate.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
probable
cause
is
the
magistrate's
decision,
not
the
policemen's.
and
if
you
affirm
this
case
and
allow
this
kind
of
complaint
to
go
through,
you'll
be
delivering
the
unbridled
authority
to
make
arrest
into
the
hands
of
the
police
because
mr.
finley
made
his
own
decision
here,
and
he
said
so
on
the
record.
he
said,
"i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
this."
well,
he's
not
the
man
that's
supposed
to
have
it.
it
is
to
make
an
arrest
under
federal
warrant.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
i
mentioned
that
in
my
brief.
the
federal
--
i
mentioned
that
in
our
brief.
federal
court
reporters
are
not
entitled
--
are
not
required
to
attend
preliminary
hearings.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
right,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
words
are
very
generous
compensation,
your
honor.
thank
you.
