mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
solely
one
of
the
admissibility
of
a
large
quantity
of
heroin
hydrochloride
ceased
from
the
petitioner
on
january
27th,
1956
at
which
time
he
was
arrested
under
a
warrant
issued
the
previous
day
by
a
united
states
commissioner,
which
warrant
was
supported
by
a
complaint
which
charged
the
petitioner
with
receiving
and
concealing
heroin
hydrochloride
in
violation
of
section
174
of
title
21.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
evidence
was
inadmissible
because
it
was
obtained
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
arrest.
he
contends
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful
because
the
warrant
upon
which
it
was
purported
to
have
been
made
was
not
supported
by
a
complaint
satisfying
the
requirements
of
rule
3
of
the
federal
rules,
and
also
that
the
complainant
did
not
have
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
is
precisely
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it
turns
on
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
the
government
of
course
supports
the
legally
of
the
arrest.
it
does
this
under
several
theories
or
on
double
basis.
first,
it
contends
that
the
arrest
was
lawful
under
state
law.
we
of
course
must
look
to
the
state
law
to
determine
the
legality
of
arrest
where
there
is
no
federal
statute
authorizing
a
federal
officer
to
make
an
arrest
without
warrant.
the
di
re
case,
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
correctly
interprets
as
so
holding.
and
incidentally
in
that
case,
i
believe
there
was
a
federal
officer
present
so
that
it
is
precisely
in
point
here.
the
particular
statute
of
the
state
of
texas
upon
which
the
government
relies
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
brief
and
it
is
article
725
(b)
of
the
texas
penal
code.
now,
we
did
not
raise
this
issue
precisely
in
the
court
below
at
that
time,
we
were
under
the
impression
that
we
had
to
rely
upon
article
212
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
of
the
state
of
texas
which
permits
arrest
by
a
private
person
where
the
felony
is
being
committed
in
his
presence
and
he
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
defendant
is
about
to
escape.
in
this
instance
of
course,
no
contention
was
made
by
the
government
that
the
officer
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
an
escape
was
going
to
be
attempted
so
we
did
not
attempt
to
justify
the
arrest
under
that
statute.
nor
did
we
attempt
to
justify
the
arrest
or
do
we
attempt
to
justify
the
arrest
in
this
court
upon
the
basis
that
the
officer
could
have
observed
the
crime
being
committed
in
his
presence.
although,
i
must
say
that
the
interpretation
of
the
court
below
in
that
regard
which
can
be
found
in
the
opinion
which
is
printed
in
the
record
and
the
particular
portion
to
which
i
allude
is
at
page
65,
the
court
below
did
undertake
by
way
of
dicta
of
course
because
its
real
holding
was
placed
upon
the
waiver
theory.
but
it
did
say
that
moreover,
there
was
enough
in
the
record
to
make
it
clear
that
an
honest
official
might
well
have
thought
he
was
fully
observing
the
legal
restraints
placed
upon
his
actions
and
that
he
had
good
cause
for
arrest.
even
if
the
warrant
already
obtained
was
invalid
since
he
believed
he
saw
a
felony
being
committed
in
his
presence,
a
belief
that
subsequent
events
proved
to
be
true.
now,
the
--
as
i've
said,
the
--
the
government
first
supports
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
upon
the
basis
that
the
arrest
was
valid
under
texas
state
law.
now,
article
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
the
--
the
law
is
very
sparse
on
the
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
of
course
the
leading
case
is
walker
and
that
holds
squarely
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
oh,
yes.
the
--
the
texas
state
cases
are
--
they
are
also
cited
in
our
brief
incidentally
and
we
rely
on
them.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
giacona
and
harper
are
the
two
texas
cases
which
--
to
which
he
refers
of
course.
and
in
harper
of
course,
there
was
absolutely
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
a
previously
convicted
narcotic
violator
was
observed
by
police
officers
sitting
in
his
car,
and
that
was
the
sole
basis
for
the
arrest.
the
--
the
officer
attempted
to
justify
it
on
some
suspicious
grounds
but
really,
the
essential
basis
upon
which
he
made
the
arrest
was
pure
suspicion,
and
we
don't
adopt
that
case
at
all.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
--
i
believe
that
the
harper
case
holds
squarely
on
the
facts,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
giacona
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
harper
is
not.
harper
is
not,
giacona
is.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
284.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
harper
against
states,
cited
at
page
2
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
now,
in
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
giacona.
again,
there
was
a
very
unfavorable
factual
situation.
the
officers
merely
had
information
that
giacona
was
in
possession
of
some
marijuana
and
that
his
car
was
going
to
arrive
at
a
particular
parking
lot
at
a
certain
time
and
going
there,
they
observed
him
drive
into
the
parking
lot
and
at
that
time,
placed
him
under
arrest.
they
also
arrested
his
wife
rosie
giacona
who
was
the
defendant
in
the
giacona
case.
her
husband
pete,
i
believe,
had
pled
guilty.
rosie
giacona
contended
that
the
officers
had
no
reason
to
arrest
her
because
they
had
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
she
was
in
possession
of
any
contraband.
and
i
believe
that
again,
we
have
a
--
two
factual
situation.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
do,
your
honor.
however,
mr.
walsh
i
think
extends
the
texas
cases
beyond
the
point
to
which
they
have
gone
in
contending
that
the
fact
which
must
observed
must
be
an
incriminating
fact.
the
--
the
fact
as
we
contend
simply
must
be
one
which
corroborates
his
prior
information.
perhaps
i
should
at
this
point
recount
the
facts
upon
which
the
agent
purported
to
act.
as
mr.
walsh
has
pointed
out,
the
investigation
commenced
about
a
month
prior
to
the
date
of
his
arrest.
it
was
engendered
by
information
received
from
various
sources
and
it
continued
for
a
period
of
approximately
one
month
during
which
time
the
agent
received
information
from
other
law
enforcement
officers
and
that
information
was
to
the
effect
that
giordenello
was
in
possession
--
i'm
reading
now
from
page
18
of
the
record,
about
two
thirds
of
the
way
down.
there
is
testimony
by
agent
finley
who
made
the
arrest
as
to
what
was
the
basis
of
his
information.
and
at
this
point,
before
i
read
it,
i
would
like
to
point
this
out,
that
the
government
is
here
compelled
to
defend
the
arrest
and
to
support
the
arrest
upon
probable
cause
upon
a
record
made
by
the
petitioner.
this
is
so
because
this
record
was
made
in
a
motion
to
suppress
here
at
which
point
during
which
hearing
of
course
the
petitioner
had
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
lack
of
probable
cause.
had
he
not
waived
his
preliminary
hearing
and
had
he
insisted
upon
that
proceeding,
the
government
would
have
had
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
probable
cause
and
in
justification
of
the
arrest.
and
of
course
the
government
attorney
having
such
a
burden
would
not
have
done
i
think
what
he
did
in
the
suppression
hearing.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
the
government
attorney
was
understandably
reluctant,
i
believe,
to
bring
out
all
of
the
evidentiary
details.
if
petitioner
was
unwilling
to
bring
them
out,
there
was
no
compulsion
upon
him
to
do
it.
the
burden
was
on
the
petitioner
to
--
to
establish
lack
of
probable
cause.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
rely
on
both,
your
honor.
we
say
that
first
of
all,
it
can
be
justified
under
texas
law
irrespective
of
the
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
secondly,
that
the
warrant
was
valid.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
thirdly,
that
even
if
the
warrant
were
not
valid
that
he
waived
its
invalidity.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
requisites
of
a
complaint
are
stated
in
rule
3
of
the
federal
rules,
and
we
cite
rule
3
at
page
3
of
our
brief
insofar
as
it's
applicable
here.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
of
course,
we
--
we
must
assume
that
the
arrest
must
be
justified
on
--
upon
constitutional
grounds
and
no
warrants
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause.
the
question
of
course
is
not
what
the
complaint
said
or
what
the
warrant
said
but
what
the
commissioner
knew.
now,
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
the
--
the
petitioner's
counsel
very
outrightly
and
skillfully
did
not
bring
out
the
facts
of
what
the
commissioner
knew.
he
preferred
to
base
his
questions
upon
a
theory
that
he
had
at
that
time
that
he
thought
was
valid,
namely
that
the
agent
did
not
have
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
which
he
alleged
in
his
complaint.
then
i
may
say
this
that
the
contention
now
made
by
the
petitioner
that
the
complaint
did
not
state
essential
facts,
was
not
made
during
the
trial,
it
was
made
for
the
first
time
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
in
our
view,
the
complaint
must
contain
no
more
than
what
was
contained
in
this
complaint
in
this
case
which
said,
william
e.
finley,
agent,
bureau
of
narcotics
being
duly
sworn
does
state
that
veto
giordenello
did
on
the
27th
day
of
january
1956
or
26th
day
of
january
1956
received
and
concealed
heroin
hydrochloride
in
violation
of
21
u.s.c.
174.
now,
we
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
rely
on
several
cases.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
for
instance
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
there
is
a
dolan
case,
i'm
not
sure
if
we
cited
that
in
our
brief.
walker
of
course
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
there
--
the
law
on
this
subject
is
very
sparse,
you
see
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
of
course,
the
--
yes,
the
lonsdale
case
cited
at
--
now,
i
just
wouldn't
cite
that
one
either.
mr.
walsh
cited
lonsdale
and
of
course,
we
didn't
rely
on
lonsdale
because
that
was
a
peculiar
case.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
did
not.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
you
see,
we
rely
upon
walker
below.
and
the
walker
case,
the
opinion
does
not
set
forth
the
gist
of
the
complaint.
that
--
that
is,
it
doesn't
set
forth
the
complaint
in
its
entirety
and
the
holding
of
the
walker
case
is
of
course
that
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
your
honor,
it's
a
second
circuit
decision
reported
at,
i
believe
197
f.2d.
there
have
been
some
lower
court
cases
that
i
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
i
may
have
missed
the
precise
import
of
your
question
just
before
we
adjourned.
as
i
understand
it,
you
wish
to
know
which
cases
the
government
relies
on
as
supporting
the
proposition
that
a
complaint
stated
in
the
terms
of
a
statute
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
rely
upon
the
walker
case
for
that
proposition.
and
of
course,
we
also
rely
for
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
it
is,
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
--
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
cited
at
various
places.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
particular
point
is
--
is
made
at
page
30
of
our
brief.
and
of
course,
other
cases
are
cited
at
that
place
in
our
brief,
page
30,
which
support
the
proposition
that
an
indictment
in
the
language
of
a
statute
will
suffice.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
now,
this
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there
should
not
be,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
two
rules
--
rules
--
the
form
of
the
indictment
as
governed
by
rule
7
(c)
of
the
criminal
rules
and
its
language
is
practically
identical
to
rule
3.
and
it
again
requires
that
the
essential
facts
of
the
crime
be
stated
and
we
see
no
reason
why
a
different
interpretation
should
be
placed
upon
the
phrase
"essential
facts"
in
one
rule
and
in
the
other.
they
are
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
point
i
made,
mr.
justice
harlan,
was
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
commissioner
did
not
have
additional
facts
before
him
than
were
contained
in
the
complaint.
if
we
--
i
think
shouldn't
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
it
also
goes
to
the
validity
of
the
complaint
and
warrant
point
also,
because
the
commissioner
is
under
an
admonition
in
his
own
manual
that
he
should
not
issue
a
warrant
upon
the
mere
suggestion
of
a
complaining
witness.
he
should
examine
the
witness
under
oath
both
the
complainant
and
any
other
witnesses.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
he
did
nor
that
he
did
not.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
of
course,
we
--
we
rely
on
an
assumption
of
regularity
of
the
proceedings
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
we
--
we
do
stand
on
it,
your
honor,
but
mr.
walsh
of
course
made
a
point
that
no
facts
were
communicated
to
the
commissioner.
to
make
--
to
draw
that
conclusion
you
would
have
to
assume
that
the
commissioner
didn't
do
his
duty.
i
think
that
a
presumption
of
regularity
to
that
effect
surrounds
the
commissioner's
proceedings.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it's
up
to
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
it
--
depending
on
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
depending
on
where
he
raises
it.
if
he
raises
it
at
the
preliminary
hearing
then
it's
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
go
forward
and
prove
what
was
before
the
commissioner.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
he
wish
it
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
if
he
wishes
to
raise
the
regularity
of
his
arrest.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
we
say
that
he
waives
the
regularity
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
he
waives
the
regularity
of
his
arrest
that
we
say
he
waives
any
technical
infirmity
or
defect
in
the
complaint.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
both
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
exactly
--
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well
i
--
i
said
that
mr.
walsh
contended
in
his
argument
that
no
additional
--
no
additional
facts
were
before
the
commissioner.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
and
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
oh,
there
is
not,
mr.
justice
black.
there
is
none.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
insofar
as
an
independent
inquiry
that
i
undertook
upon
assuming
this
case,
i
--
i
have
been
able
to
determine
only
that
this
is
the
common
practice
if
indeed
it
is
not
the
universal
practice
of
tracking
the
language
of
a
statute,
provided
of
course
the
statute
contains
all
the
essential
elements
of
the
offense.
some
statutes
do
not
of
course
and
if
--
if
the
complaint
is
made
out
upon
such
a
statute,
it
must
add
the
necessary
elements.
but
it's
particularly
appropriate,
we
think,
that
the
complaint
in
a
narcotics
effects
such
as
we
have
here
be
sufficient
if
it
tracks
the
lack
of
the
language
of
the
statute
because
the
statute
is
framed
in
terms
of
action
and
it
also
has
a
presumptive
provision
from
which
guilt
is
prima
facie
evidence
--
evident
if
the
proof
of
possession
is
adduced
by
the
government,
so
that
when
we
charge
as
we
did
in
this
complaint
here,
that
the
defendant
did
receive
and
conceal
heroine,
we
were
in
effect
stating
that
he
possessed
heroine,
and
that
is
a
fact.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
law
of
texas,
mr.
justice
black,
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
the
government
of
course
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
i
think
it
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
it's
undoubtedly
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
that
we
do
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
be
particularly
contented
to
stand
here
and
defend
this
case
upon
the
validity
of
the
warrant
and
upon
the
theory
that
by
not
contesting
the
regularity
of
the
warrant
and
the
regularity
of
his
arrest
at
the
preliminary
hearing
which
he
waived
--
he
thereby
waived
the
right
to
challenge
the
validity
of
his
arrest.
however
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that
--
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
opinions
may
detour
about
this
complaint
and
for
that
reason
we
contend,
of
course,
that
the
arrest
can
still
be
supported
on
an
alternative
theory
and
that
is
the
--
well,
two
alternative
theories,
the
right
of
the
agent
to
arrest
him
under
texas
state
law,
and
also,
the
waiver
theory
that
by
not
asking
and
receiving
the
preliminary
hearing
and
he
has
consented
to
be
maintained
in
custody
and
also
deprived
himself
of
the
right
to
challenge
the
validity
of
his
arrest.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
well,
perhaps
mr.
chief
justice,
we
did
emphasize
a
--
a
theory
which
was
subsidiary
to
the
principal
one
upon
which
we
contend
the
--
this
judgment
below
can
be
supported.
however,
i
think
they're
both
equally
supportable
and
equally
valid.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
oh,
yes,
a
great
deal
more.

of
the
record
which
i
was
planning
to
read
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
actually
the
testimony
in
point
commences
on
page
17.
but
at
this
point
the
--
and
this
was
a
testimony
elicited
during
the
motion
to
suppress.
petitioner's
counsel
was
attempting
to
show
that
the
agent
did
not
have
a
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
which
he
alleged
in
his
complaint.
and
the
agent
in
attempting
to
show
that
he
had
plenty
of
information
upon
which
to
seek
the
complaint,
testified
that,
page
18,
?i
had
kept
a
surveillance
on
this
man
beginning
the
latter
days
of
december.
as
i
said
before,
he
was
in
possession
of
information
which
corroborated
my
surveillance,
and
vice-versa,
my
surveillance
corroborated
my
information
that
he
was
in
houston
and
planned
to
go
to
chicago,
illinois
to
bring
back
a
large
supply
of
heroin.
and
he
did
leave.
and
he
did
return.
and
my
surveillance
did
corroborate
that
information.
in
addition
to
that,
i
had
received
information
from
other
law
enforcement
officers
that
he
was
in
town
with
that
large
quantity
of
heroin.
now
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
that's
right.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
i
was
just
about
to
do
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
after
the
warrant
had
been
obtained,
agent
finley
on
the
following
day
took
up
surveillance
outside
petitioner's
home,
and
he
observed
him
in
company
with
a
known
police
character,
officer
shelton,
who
accompanied
the
agent,
testified
to
that.
and
they
followed
the
two
in
separate
cars,
the
petitioner
in
his
cadillac
automobile
and
this
police
character
in
a
chevrolet
to
another
part
of
houston
where
they
stopped
and
engaged
in
conversation
on
the
street.
and
after
they
resumed
their
journey,
this
well-known
police
character
turned
north
on
lathrop
street
and
the
petitioner
turned
south.
the
police
characters
went
--
went
one
block
and
stopped
and
remained
in
his
car.
the
petitioner
went
one
block
--
i'm
sorry,
the
character
went
north,
the
petitioner
went
one
block
south
to
the
intersection
of
brownsville
and
lathrop
where
he
entered
a
dwelling.
the
officers
continued
their
surveillance
and
he
--
the
petitioner
remained
inside
for
about
one-half
hour.
and
then,
he
emerged
from
the
house
and
entered
the
garage
into
the
rear
of
the
building.
he
remained
inside
the
garage
only
a
few
seconds
and
came
out
of
the
sidedoor
at
which
time
he
was
carrying
a
paper
bag
in
his
hand.
now,
the
agents
of
course
approached
him
as
he
approached
the
gateway
to
the
yard.
and
at
that
point,
they
arrested
him.
we
--
mr.
john
l.
murphy
the
--
oh,
well,
they
found
the
five
ounces
--
six
ounces
of
heroin
and
95
paper
bindles,
and
a
quantity
of
both
heroin
as
well.
these
facts,
we
say,
in
their
totality
taken
together
with
the
information
that
agent
finley
had,
and
as
i
said,
all
of
the
information
that
he
had
is
not
contained
in
this
record.
but
if
i
may
allude
for
a
moment
to
the
record
in
number
515,
which
is
also
before
this
court,
the
court
may
see
that
agent
finley
had
much
more.
he,
for
instance
knew
that
a
seller
who
was
employed
by
the
petitioner
had
made
a
sale
on
that
very
morning
and
various
things
like
that.
so,
there
is
much
more
that
could
have
been
brought
out
but
as
i
say,
the
government
is
compelled
to
rely
upon
a
record
made
by
the
petitioner,
for
this
reason,
we
think
it
should
be
held
to
his
waiver.
mr.
john
l.
murphy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
