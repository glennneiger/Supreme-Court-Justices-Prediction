justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think

not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
in
page
30
of
your
brief,
i
see
those
are
all
court
of
appeals
cases,
you
have
none
from
this
court
from
which
you
rely
on
at
this
point,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
made
one
statement
and
i
didn't
--
i
might
understand
you.
you
said
that
the
law
issued
is
dependent
on
the
facts,
on
the
facts
that
(inaudible),
but
no
additional
information
for
the
community
to
the
(inaudible)
is
that
an
evidence
so
far
as
on
what
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
record
on
one
side
or
the
other
as
to
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
some
statements
here
that

hold
an
affidavit
of
this
kind
sufficient
as
a
basis
for
arrest
provided
there
were
affidavits
that
had
showing
the
fact
with
some
particularity,
is
there
any
such
law
as
that
in
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
your
cases
are
collected
in
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
contrary
to
the
walker
case
on
the
question
of
whether
the
complaint
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
following
the
statutory
language
are
sufficient?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
your
reputation
in
this
case
is
that
they
require
if
followed,
both
statements
of
facts
on
which
the
probable
cause
is
taken.
