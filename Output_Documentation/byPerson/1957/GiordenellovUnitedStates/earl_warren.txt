veto
giordenello,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
walsh,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
practice,
mr.
walsh,
in
the
federal
system?
i
know
in
the
state
system
for
instance,
this
practice
is
a
common
thing.
it
says
to
allege
the
ultimate
fact
that
--
that
it
shall
be
or
whatever
happens
to
be
but
in
the
federal
system,
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
practice
as
to
--
as
to
complaints.
do
they
set
forth
with
the
--
the
facts
to
establish
the
offense
or
do
they
just
allege
the
ultimate
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
rely
on
the
warrant
of
arrest
that
this
officer
had
or
do
you
rely
under
some
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
mr.
walsh
about
the
prerequisites
of
a
complaint
and
what
that
complaint
must
show.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
what
--
what
must
the
complaint
contain?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
the
case
has
support
you
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case
do
you
rely
on
particularly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there's
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
directly
in
point?
if
you
have
one
that's
in
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
one
--
one
whom
you
didn't
--
one
that
was
directly
in
point
and
you
didn't
cite
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
all
the
more
reason
why
i
would
think
you
would
cite
it
if
it's
directly
in
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
or
you
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
one
do
you
rely
on?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
you
have
stated
here,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
that
was
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
is
not
in
your
brief
though,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
he
do
that
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy,
what
is
the
system
or
what
is
the
factors
in
the
federal
system
insofar
as
these
complaints
are
concerned?
is
--
is
it
the
practice
to
do
as
you
have
done
here
merely
--
merely
alleged
in
the
words
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
murphy,
if
you're
satisfied
on
that
point,
why
don't
you
just
rely
on
your
warrant
as
being
the
grounds
for
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
a
very
simple
thing
if
--
if
you're
satisfied
on
your
law
there,
if
it
is
a
fact
to
assume
a
federal
system
to
do
that,
it's
been
done
for
--
for
many
years,
why
do
you
bring
a
new
issue
into
the
case
and
try
to
redirect
our
attention
to
texas
law?
why
don't
you
say
the
man
who
was
--
who
was
armed
with
a
federal
warrant
here
and
he
saw
the
man
and
walked
over
and
he
arrested
him.
that's
--
that's
enough
if
you've
got
a
good
warrant,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
away
from
that
--
from
that
particular
thing
and
take
us
into
the
state
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
needn't
have
to
go
that
far
if
you're
satisfied
with
your
warrant,
do
you?
the
--
you
know,
there
is
no
problem
of
waiver
here
if
it's
a
good
warrant,
is
it?
so
really
all
--
the
main
question
here
is,
is
that
a
good
warrant?
if
it
is
a
good
warrant,
no
question
about
it
from
your
standpoint,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
seems
to
me
from
your
argument
that
you
were
shunning
this
warrant
into
the
background
and
--
and
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
raising
the
state
issue
and
thrusting
that
forward
and
basing
it
on
that.
and
then,
if
you
had
to
get
to
the
other
to
--
to
put
on
the
grounds
of
waiver
where
i
--
i
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
that
should
be
a
procedure
if
you're
satisfied
with
this
warrant.
and
that
--
that
to
me
is
--
is
really
the
main
part
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
walsh,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
appreciation
for
you're
having
accepted
appointment
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant
and
for
the
diligence
with
which
you
have
sustained
that
responsibility.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
always
comforting
by
the
fact
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
give
their
time
or
energy
to
a
cause
--
a
public
cause
of
that
kind,
so
we
appreciate
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
mr.
murphy,
we
appreciate
of
course
the
diligence
with
you
--
which
you
have
represented
the
interests
of
our
government.
