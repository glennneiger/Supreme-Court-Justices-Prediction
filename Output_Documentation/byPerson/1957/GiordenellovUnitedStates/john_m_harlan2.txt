john
m.
harlan
do
you,
mr.
murphy,
you
made
some
statement,
i
misunderstood
almost
to
the
effect
that
the
commissioner
had
more
data
before
him
than
this
application
for
the
warrant
indicated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
should
--
that
goes
to
your
waiver
point,
does
it?
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
waiver
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
you
stand
on
what
the
record
shows,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
assuming
that
you
have
to
stand
on
the
justification
for
an
arrest
without
a
warrant,
in
other
words,
assuming
that
we
should
disagree
with
the
warrant
itself,
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
adds
to
the
officer's
knowledge
beyond
that
which
is
contained
in
the
affidavit
for
the
warrant?
is
there
anything
more
affirmative
in
the
record?
