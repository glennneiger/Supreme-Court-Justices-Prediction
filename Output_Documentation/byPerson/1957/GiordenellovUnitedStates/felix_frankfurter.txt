aren't
warrants

aren't
warrants
of
arrest
issued
on
the
basis
of
an
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
you've
just
indicated
it
was
lost
at
the
very
best
--
an
indictment
has
freer
scope
of
non-disclosure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
finding
of
the
grand
jury
expressed
as
vaguely
as
--
it's
hypothesized
in
this
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
it
has
defined
what
it
has
found
in
a
manner
or
with
the
vagueness
that
would
be,
from
your
point
of
view,
inadequate
to
allow
the
issuance
of
an
--
of
arrest
that's
made
in
the
complaint.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
okay.
that
was
disturbing
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
people
don't
waive
hearings
merely
in
order
to
expedite
hearings
and
get
to
your
trial
on
the
merits,
the
rehearings
for
all
sorts
of
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
but
i
mean
hearings
are
waived
not
merely
because
primarily
--
because
defendant
(inaudible)
greatly
interest,
did
he,
in
the
efficient
administration
of
criminal
justice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
a
little
startled
by
the
--
what
you
say
as
the
government's
contention.
what
is
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
lower
court?
so
the
question
certainly
hasn't
come
before
us.
what
--
what
is
the
rulings
of
the
lower
courts
before
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
district
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
whether
because
he
waived
a
--
by
waiving
--
by
--
by
not
having
a
preliminary
hearing,
he
waived
the
infirmities
leading
to
the
arrest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
brought
up
to
believe
that
that
it's
mostly
valuable
to
encourage
going
to
the
place
of
trail
instead
of
trying
things
out
at
the
place
of
arrest
for
a
removal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
there
were
four.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
one
that
judge
reeds
dealt
with
and
quoted
at
length
in
judge
hand's
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
--
i
think
that
that
carries
it
very
far
on
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
--
you
--
you
challenge
the
government
--
disagree
with
the
government
that
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute
of
this,
i
--
because
this,
because
i
know
not.
the
local
law
of
arrest
determines
the
federal
light
for
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
they
decided
that
in
--
whatever
it
was,
di
re
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
is
a
federal
rule,
but
i
--
i
just
want
to
be
corrected.
but
i
thought
the
whole
problem
of
di
re
was,
since
there
is
no
federal
legislation
and
no
determination
by
this
court
in
formulating
general
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
in
order
to
ascertain
the
validity
of
an
arrest,
you
go
not
unnaturally
to
what
the
local
law
of
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
if
i
exaggerated
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
don't
waste
your
time
because
you've
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
texas
law
is
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that
you've
embraced
the
reading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
questioned
that
if
the
arrest
was
legal,
the
search
was
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
turns
under
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
the
word
amounts
to
cases
that
mr.
walsh
vouches
for
his
own
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
just
the
texas
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

in
his
reply
brief
as
getting
texas
law
in
his
favor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
the
cases
but
it
makes
a
lot
of
deference,
but
the
--
the
texas
court
said
that
on
the
facts,
there
was
no
probable
cause
or
whether
the
texas
court
said
something
else
which
is
what
i
gather
from
mr.
walsh's
account
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in,
mr.
walsh's
brief
284
s.w.2d.
justice
felix
frankfurter
harper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
other
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
your
facts,
that
if
one
reads
the
record,
it
would
come
in
what
mr.
walsh
spoke
from
thomas
against
state
that
the
officer
have
some
information
that
the
accuse
of
violating
the
law
plus
some
act
on
the
part
of
the
accused,
which
would
bolster
it
before
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
nothing
--
but
nothing
prevents
the
government
in
a
suppression
hearing
to
pile
up
the
evidence
even
though
the
burden
is
on
the
other
fellow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
federal
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
you
would
begin
earlier
and
begin
with
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
the
assumption
would
validate
every
requirement,
wouldn't
it?
because
you
--
one
must
assume
whatever
the
record
shows
there
was
enough
for
the
commissioner
to
issue
the
warrant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
as
you
say
that
it's
up
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rest
to
defendant
who
affirmatively
there
was
nothing
(voice
overlap)
to
the
commissioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
implication
of
that
is
that
there
is
some
compulsion
or
some
compartment
to
have
--
to
have
a
preliminary
hearing
not
to
dispense
with
it
but
with
some
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
some
pressure
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
has
a
choice
not
to.
he
considers
a
waiver
hearing
right
now.
did
he
ever
agrees
to
everything
else
that
goes
along
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
the
question
is
whether
he
waived?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
that
spelling
of
the
complaint,
you
know,
i
covered
these
cases,
that's
one
thing.
but
does
he
waive
the
process
by
which
he's
supposed
to
meet
legally
before
a
--
before
the
federal
authority,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
waiver
mean
in
that
sense?
it
means,
that's
what
you
use.
it
means
that
an
implication
of
law
if
he
doesn't
take
advantage
of
saying
i
want
--
i
want
a
jury,
it's
an
implication
of
law
that
the
--
he
underwrites
everything
up
to
that
point
is
regular.
that's
what
this
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
means
that's
a
rule
of
law
and
not
any
waiver
in
the
sense
that's
something
a
man
chooses
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
walsh,
you
could
shave
down
the
authority
of
walker
still
more.
in
the
first
place,
judge
swnn
said
this
is
a
collateral
attack
and
it
was
--
this
wasn't
the
way
to
raise
it,
but
raised
it
before,
but
then
he
said,
"but,
we'll
go
on."
and
he
goes
on
and
said
the
arrest
wasn't
illegal.
but
he
goes
on
and
said
that
it
was
if
that's
no
good.
anyhow,
the
search
was
made
of
a
person
not
the
petitioner,
so
he
has
no
complaints.
i
should
think
it's
abolished,
i
think
that
authority
that
you
can
get
from
(inaudible)
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
is
customary
and
i
think
mr.
murphy
indicated,
it
is
not
customary
to
have
stenographic
units
in
the
proceedings
before
the
u.s.commissioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
though
it's
more
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
all
you
have
is
what
was
forwarded
before
the
commissioner
and
not
the
supporting
evidence.
