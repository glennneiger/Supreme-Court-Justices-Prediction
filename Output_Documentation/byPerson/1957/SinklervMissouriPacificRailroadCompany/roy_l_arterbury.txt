mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i'm
ready
for
the
respondent.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
if
the
court
please,
our
counsel
is
now
on
upheld
case
as
i
see
it.
the
only
reason
on
the
merit
is
in
this
court
is
because
this
case
was
barred
for
the
statute
of
limitation
of
two
years
in
texas
if
he
had
sued
the
company
who
is
at
fault.
this
client
knew
that
and
i
quote
the
language
here
to
make
a
claim
from
the
transcript
of
the
testimony.
question
-
in
the
mean
thought
--
“in
the
meantime,
we're
all
about
the
march
21st,
1952,
he
went
to
your
lawyer
and
you
decide
to
file
a
suit
didn't
you?"
"yes."
"and
you
didn't
file
a
suit
against
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
railroad
company,
the
one
you
said
was
responsible
for
your
injury,
did
you?"
"no,
sir.
i
did
not."
"and
the
reason
you
didn't
file
a
suit
against
them,
you
knew
that
your
cause
of
action,
your
suit
was
barred
by
two
--
two-year
statute
of
limitation?"
"yes,
sir."
"you
knew
that?"
"and
your
lawyer
confirmed
that?"
"and
so
then
you
decided
you
would
sue
your
own
company,
the
company
you
were
working
for?"
"yes".
question
-
“since
you
couldn't
sue
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
railroad
company
direct,
your
lawyer
told
you
that
you
would
take
a
chance
and
see
what
you
could
do
by
suing
your
own
company."
that's
why
he's
here.
there's
not
anything
in
the
law
of
the
statutes
of
any
state
or
the
statutes
of
the
federal
government
which
says
that
a
railroad
company
cannot
employ
switching
carriers.
you'll
find
switching
carriers,
terminal
carriers
in
almost
every
large
city
in
this
country.
houston
was
large
enough
over
50
years
ago
to
accommodate
a
switching
carrier
and
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
railroad
company
was
organized
in
1905
to
do
and
perform
the
various
services
were
stated
in
this
case.
they
uploaded
a
$5
million
bond
issue.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
now
i
think
it
serves
about
four
or
five,
four
or
five
railroads.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
no,
the
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe
owns
25%.
the
fort
worth
and
denver
owns
12.5%.
the
chicago
archive
pacific
owns
12.5%.
now
the
missouri
pacific
who
--
who
now
owns
what
four
of
the
railroad
companies
formerly
owned,
owns
the
other
50%.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
pardon?
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
pardon
me,
missouri
pacific
i
should
have
said.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
no.
no,
the
southern
pacific
has
its
own
terminals.
there's
a
movement
on
--
well
right
now
in
houston
to
have
all
of
these
roads
at
the
union
station
move
over
and
use
the
southern
pacific
station
under
arrangements
which
they're
trying
to
work
out.
that's
an
economic
and
a
business
proposition
which
no
doubt
will
in
time
work
out.
the
railroads
have
to
do
something.
they
--
they
can't
all
have
switching
yards.
they
can't
all
have
separate
depots
and
facilities.
and
that's
the
very
reason
that
they
undertook
to
do
it
way
back
50
years
ago.
and
in
houston,
this
thing
had
been
going
on
for
over
50
years.
the
counsel
has
brought
out
that
the
arrangement
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
was
organized
under
--
as
a
corporation
under
the
statutes
of
texas.
there
is
a
statute
which
gives
them
the
right
to
franchise,
to
do
the
very
thing
that
they're
doing.
and
certainly
this
proposition
that
they
have
asserted
here
that
this
is
a
non-delegable
duty
can't
hold
one.
the
missouri
pacific
lines
contracts
to
bring
freight
and
passengers
from
one
point
to
its
terminal
and
another
point.
it
just
so
happens
that
this
terminal
in
houston
is
the
yard
of
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
railroad
company.
and
certainly,
it's
not
illegal.
it's
done
and
complies
with
the
law,
both
the
statutory
law
and
the
decision
law
of
both
the
supreme
court
--
this
honorable
court
and
the
state
courts
of
texas
and
other
states.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
absolutely
not
of
the
houston
belt
and
terminal.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
no,
no,
sir.
that's
brought
out
in
--
in
our
briefs
and
it's
quoted
and
showed.
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
in
the
contract
with
the
h.b.
and
t.
reserved
the
right
to
supervise
and
control
all
of
its
operations
and
to
hire
and
fire
its
employees.
now,
that
--
those
were
the
tests
that
are
laid
down
in
the
decisions,
and
when
this
--
this
case
had
been
tried
three
times,
reversed
three
times.
the
first
was
a
mistrial,
personal
reason
on
--
by
the
court.
the
second
was
a
hung
jury
over
this
very
fact.
counsel
introduced
over
our
objection
some
of
these
reports.
i
went
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
we
objected
because
they
did
use
the
word
"agent"
in
the
contract.
well,
we
didn't
like
that
group
of
the
jury
because
the
jury
wouldn't
understand.
and
your
court
would
understand
that
the
agent
--
the
word
agent
there
was
used
in
its
general
sense
and
not
to
specialize
then
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
now
the
court
--
the
court
instructed
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
now,
here
--
here's
--
perhaps,
your
honor
saw
in
the
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
i'm
not
entirely
correct.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
now,
your
honor
might
have
seen
this,
and
no
doubt
counsel
has
in
its
brief
and
it
may
be
announced
that
the
missouri
pacific
in
their
contract
agreement
did
have
this
--
they
have
said
this,
that
if
at
any
time,
any
employee
of
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
did
anything
wrong,
became
inefficient
or
guilty
of
something
that
a
railroad
man
shouldn't
be
guilty
of,
then
they'd
have
a
right
to
demand
that
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
will
fire
him.
now,
that's
my
point
to
you.
and
this
--
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
touches
on
that.
they
say,
yes,
they
have
a
right
to
demand,
but
what
happens
when
they
do
that
if
they
should
do
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
one
of
the
managers
of
houston
belt
and
terminal
and
said
he'd
been
a
miner
since
1913
and
then
never
had
it
been
any
such
exercise
of
into
such
variety.
but
here's
what
would
have
happened
if
that
had
taken
place.
they
have
--
would
have
written
to
the
h
.b.and
t.
and
say
we
don't
like
one
of
your
--
employee
did
this
on
an
occasion
and
we
don't
think
it's
about
the
employee.
they
couldn't
say
now
you
fire
him
or
we're
going
to
fire
him.
they
can
say
that.
all
they
could
do
is
report
the
infraction
of
some
duty.
then
it
became
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
be
fired.
he
had
a
right
for
a
hearing,
a
representative
of
his
union.
now,
the
h.b.
and
t
have
their
own
contract
with
the
union
organizations.
you
have
the
right
to
have
the
representative
of
union
there
at
the
hearing,
and
if
for
any
reason
the
union
man
thought
he
wasn't
properly
fired
that
he
have
a
right
to
go
before
the
--
the
grievance
committee.
so
the
missouri
pacific
could
not
have
itself
fire
any
of
the
employees.
they
can
hire
them,
they
can't
fire
them,
they
can't
exercise
any
control
over
them
neither
can
they
exercise
any
control
over
the
movements
of
the
--
of
these
trains.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
you
mean,
the
missouri
pacific
have
the
right
to
fire?
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
no,
you
won't
find
that
any
way
in
any
contract.
now
--
and
the
--
and
the
court
of
civil
appeals
below
touched
on
that
and
said
that
was
one
of
the
tests,
the
very
reason
they
couldn't
do
it.
the
only
way
on
that
is
that
they
can
exercise
any
control
of
them
not
as
a
corporation,
not
as
a
railroad
company,
but
as
a
stockholder.
and
maybe
next
year,
if
they
don't
like
the
directions
the
stockholders
meet,
and
if
they
can
control
it,
they
can
let
new
stockholders
--
i
mean,
directors.
but
that's
true
in
any
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
sure,
they
charged
the
railroad.
they
--
they
have
their
published
tariffs.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
now
i
saw
something
like
that.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
saw
something
like
--
about
that
in
the
--
in
counsel's
brief.
and
the
railroad
companies,
if
there
is
a
deficit
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well
i
don't
know
whether
every
year
but
the
chances
are
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
if
there's
deficit
those
railroads
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
like
--
like
the
stock
--
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
also
performs
services
for
other
railroads
other
than
those
who
use
this
--
these
terminals,
these
people.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
it'd
be
governed
by
the
same
law
that
pertains
to
every
question
of
when
independent
contractors
involved.
that's
what
an
independent
contractor
is
under
the
law.
it's
not
a
statutory
matter.
it's
the
common
law
and
this
court
and
other
courts
have
laid
down
the
tests
as
to
how
you
will
determine
whether
a
man
is
a
direct
agent
or
whether
there's
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
i
didn't
understand
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
didn't
understand
your
question
was
as
broad,
i
don't
think
it
could
go
out
and
turned
over
to
somebody
else
the
question
of
operating
this
railroad.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
there
you'd
have
a
question
of
a
railroad
going
out
of
business
and
just
going
to
turn
its
operation
over
somebody
else.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
as
i
understand
the
court,
of
course
that's
reducing
it
down
to
that
position
and
that
--
that
in
control
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
here's
the
--
here's
the
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
don't
think
the
southern
--
missouri
pacific
could
decide
it
doesn't
want
to
run
one
of
its
trains
from
houston
to
dallas
as
we
are
going
to
get
out
of
this
by
turning
it
over
to
somebody
else
and
call
them
an
independent
contractor.
i
don't
think
it
could
--
could
do
this
because
its
franchised
that
to
do
that
now,
if
--
if
under
the
law,
you
could
have
another
corporation
under
the
statutory
laws
of
the
state,
a
state
would
have
a
right
to
incorporate
another
railroad
company
to
do
that.
it
wouldn't
do
it
of
course
but
if
it's
good,
probably
you'd
have
a
legalized
proposition.
and
anything
that's
legalized
is
alright
under
the
--
under
the
law,
i
think
i've
said.
but
i
don't
think
texas
or
any
other
state
having
once
have
given
a
franchise
to
a
railroad
company
to
run
from
houston
to
dallas,
300
or
400
miles
would
then
legalize
another
carrier
as
a
common
carrier
and
permit
it
to
take
over
the
function
of
the
--
of
the
missouri
pacific
from
dallas
and
fort
worth,
it
wouldn't
do
that.
but
if
it
should,
it
could
be
done.
that'd
be
silly
and
rather
ridiculous
if
--
but
that's
all
about
the
law.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
on
this
ground
that
the
--
that
the
tests
that
are
laid
down
by
all
the
authorities
about
the
common
law
to
fix
the
difference
between
an
agent,
an
independent
contractor
showed
conclusively
in
this
case
that
the
houston
belt
&
terminal
was
an
independent
contractor
and
it's
therefore
was
not
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide.
and
the
court
of
civil
appeals,
the
court
below
so
held
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
that's
right.
conclusively,
those
tests
were
do
--
who
hires
your
employees?
does
the
missouri
pacific
hire
them?
no.
who
pays
them?
houston
belt
and
terminal.
who
directs
their
work?
the
houston
belt
and
terminal.
who
controls
their
operation?
does
the
missouri
pacific
or
can
the
missouri
pacific
exercise
control
over
those
employees?
it's
unequivocal
and
it's
not
contested.
so
we
had
a
motion
for
an
instructive
verdict,
it
should
have
been
given.
on
the
second
trial
of
this
case,
the
court
defined
agency
as
--
as
this,
one,
who
performs
duties
for
another
for
consideration.”
we
told
the
court,
“well
your
honor,
a
jury
will
have
to
answer
that
under
that
definition.”
yes,
an
agent.
on
the
next
trial,
the
court
gave
a
correct
definition
and
--
and
in
that,
he
named
these
tests.
when
he
did
that,
he
should
have
constructed
a
verdict
because
that
closed
the
case.
the
beaumont
court
held
that's
right.
that
is
the
lower
court.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
yes
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
may
it
please
the
court.
at
recess
time
on
yesterday,
chief
justice
warren
had
--
we
had
an
excerpt
from
petitioner's
brief
and
invited
my
observations
on
it.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
before
i
do
that,
i
want
to
preface
that
matter
with
reference
to
another
bit
of
evidence.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
as
i
remember
asked
counsel
how
this
case
could
be
maintained
in
this
court
since
the
beaumont
court
of
civil
appeals
had
held
that
there
was
no
agency
question
involved.
that
is
that
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
was
not
an
agent
of
the
respondent.
unless
there
was
a
federal
question
involved.
and
then
suggested
that
maybe
the
word
--
the
use
for
that
word
“agent”
might
raised
the
question
and
counsel
immediately
said,
“yes,
that's
how
we
got
here.”
it's
a
question
of
agency
and
referred
to
the
employers'
liability
act.
now
i
wish
your
honors
would
turn
if
you
will
please
to
page
6
of
the
respondent's
brief.
i
make
reference
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
that
it's
very
important
that
we
see
what
it
says
and
have
all
the
light
on
it
that
we
possibly
get.
it
reads
like
this,
“every
common
carrier
by
railroad
while
engaging
in
commerce
between
any
of
the
several
states
or
territories
shall
be
liable
in
damages
to
any
person
suffering
injury
while
he
is
employed
by
such
carrier
in
such
commerce,
for
such
injury
or
death
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part
from
the
negligence
of
any
of
the
officers,
agents,
or
employees
of
such
carrier.”
now
you'll
notice
that
the
word
“agents”
there
is
sandwiched
in
between
the
word
“officers”
and
“employees.”
and
necessarily
it
is
calling
to
those
other
words.
now
anyone
who
has
been
long
associated
with
railroads
and
railroad
work,
control
is
familiar
with
the
fact
it
had
become
almost
common
place
to
refer
to
certain
employees
of
the
railroad
company
as
agents.
the
man
who
was
in
charge
with
the
station
is
commonly
known
as
the
station
agent.
the
man
who
sells
tickets
is
the
ticket
agent.
the
man
who
operates
the
telegraph
is
the
telegraph
agent.
we
have
the
property
agent,
the
freight
agent,
the
ride-away
agent,
the
maintenance
of
way
agent.
and
so,
some
10
to
12
or
more
classes
of
employees
are
commonly
and
convincingly
referred
to
and
designated
as
agents.
and
so
that's
exactly
why
the
word
“agent”
here
is
sandwiched
in
between
the
word
“officers”
and
“employees”
who
have
wrote
this
article,
was
familiar
with
railroad
wordings
and
the
conventional
calling
of
names
and
designations.
now,
i'll
ask
the
court
to
look
right
across
the
page
on
page
7
where
we
quote
from
a
case
decided
for
this
honorable
court.
and
this
court
used
this
language
in
passing
upon
the
employees
and
the
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“employees”
i
quote.
we
have
opinion
that
congress,
referring
to
this
very
act,
used
the
words
“employee”
and
“employed”
in
the
statute
in
the
natural
sense
and
intended
to
describe
the
convention
--
conventional
relation
of
employee
and
employer.
the
conventional
relationship
meaning
that
this
act
meant
nothing
else
than
the
agents
who
are
employees
of
such
carriers.
that's
the
only
reason
on
that
they
used
that
word
“agent”
instead
of
just
employees.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
i
wouldn't
know
whether
they
directly
but
it
is
true
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
--
it
is
true.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
they
did
and
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
oh,
i
think
without
any
doubt
that
they
met
in
that
relationship
that
the
belt
was
agent
from
the
standpoint
that
they
performed
a
service
fault.
i
mentioned
yesterday
the
definition
of
the
court
when
they
first
filed
this
case
of
agency
which
was
corrected
the
next
time
it's
tried.
he
said
an
agent
is
one
who
performs
a
service
for
another
for
a
consideration,
that's
true.
now
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
that's
not
the
sense
in
which
the
act
uses
it.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
oh,
no
the
act
uses
it
as
an
employee
of
the
railroad
company
itself,
the
carrier
who's
employee
is
injured.
and
says
the
officers,
agents
and
employees
of
such
carrier,
the
carrier
for
whom
this
petitioner
was
working
at
the
time.
he
was
injured,
before
they
can
bring
a
suit
under
this
act,
he
must
have
been
injured
by
an
employee
or
agent
or
employee
of
the
same
company
for
whom
he
was
working
of
such
carrier,
which
he
didn't
mean
to
open
the
flood
gates
and
make
a
--
the
federal
--
this
act
apply
to
any
injury
that
might
have
been
committed
on
this
man
by
some
employee
of
another
company.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
he's
actual
employee.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
sure
all
of
these
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
sure,
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
agents
of
the
railroad
company,
ticket
agents,
policy
agents,
freight
agents
and
that's
all
of
this
act
means
here,
well
you
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
they're
also
employees
--
but
they
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
he
--
here's
the
reason
they
use
it
this
way.
officers
are
the
top
men,
the
heads
of
departments
who
are
agents,
the
station
agent
is
to
put
a
big
man
in
a
small
town
and
he
has
the
clerks
under
him.
so
he's
the
next
in
order,
officers,
agents
and
then
it
comes
just
the
general
employees.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well
they
are
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
they
could
have
but
they
use
these
three
officers,
agents
and
employees
that
cover
the
field.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
think
it
would
have.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
--
i
think
it
would
have
carried.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
all
right.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
now
the
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
the
employer
of
the
railroad
mail
agent?
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well
he's
not
an
employee
of
a
railroad
company.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
imagine
somebody
connected
with
the
post
office.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
if
he
works
on
the
train
just
like
the
express
agent
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
all
right,
that's
covered
in
here.
we
have
a
case
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
oh,
yes,
this
court
passed
on
it.
not
the
railway
--
the
mail
agent
but
the
express
agent
would
be
comparable.
and
they
held
that
the
express
agent
while
he
performs
the
services
on
that
train
he
did
not
come
under
this
act
that
he
couldn't
sue
under
this
act.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
yes,
he
performed
certain
services
for
the
railroad
company.
they
have
just
to
carry
the
mail
and
the
railroad
company
gets
to
drives
revenue
from
it.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
no,
i
don't
recall
any
your
honor,
but
it's
the
other
way
around.
we
do
have
a
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
an
express
agent
was
injured.
and
he
thought
he
could
raise
a
case
under
this
act
on
the
ground
that
he,
being
an
agent
and
performing
certain
services
for
the
railroad
company
was
protected
by
the
provisions
of
this
act.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
and
the
court
held
it
was
--
this
court
held
it
was
not.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
no,
i
have
no
such
case,
your
honor.
the
case
i
read
from
on
page
6
is
the
robinson
case
decided
in
this
court
where
an
express
agent
was
suing
for
an
injured
done
to
him
by
the
other
servant
of
the
railroad
company
and
he
sought
to
come
under
this
act
and
the
court
--
this
act
didn't
cover
him
because
he
was
not
an
employee
of
the
carrier
or
the
employee
of
the
person
who
is
injured.
now,
he
can
sue
that
common
law
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
--
but
he
can't
come
under
this
act.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
he
--
he
would
have
to
be
an
employee
of
the
--
in
another
words,
it's
employer
against
the
employee.
it's
not
employee
against
some
third
person.
they're
trying
to
bring
in
a
third
person
here
on
the
ground
and
trying
to
show
you
its
nature
under
the
provision
of
this
act,
within
the
purview
of
this
act.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
officers
or
its
agents
or
employees.
that
is
all
the
same
they
just
use
an
extra
wording.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
it
means
something
just
the
same
as
employee
means
something.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
it
--
it
means
the
same
thing
as
officers
or
employees,
they
just
--
i've
tried
these
cases
and
every
case
we
took
up
--
very
petition
you
read
--
my
time
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
when
you
pick
up
the
plaintiff's
petition
in
this
damage
suits
against
the
railroad
company
and
to
long
usage
of
petitioner
or
counsel
for
--
or
plaintiff
will
say,
“due
to
the
negligence
of
the
defendants,
its
agents,
servants
and
employees”
you'll
find
that
a
dozen
times
in
every
petition
damage
suit
petition.
and
in
the
charge
to
the
court
you'll
find
that
the
defendant,
its
agents,
servants
and
employees
on
this
case
in
question
who
is
at
the
top
of
the
others.
it
become
common
pleas
to
refer
to
the
employees
of
a
railroad
company
agents,
servants
or
employees
through
long
usage,
just
exactly
the
way
it
is
that
the
congress
used
it
from
this
case,
whoever
wrote
that
act
do
something
about
railroad
verdicts.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
that's
right,
because
so
many
of
the
employees
of
the
railroad
company
are
referred
to
as
agents.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
oh,
no.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
oh
no.
i'm
saying
just
the
opposite.
i'm
saying
the
sense
of
using
the
act
is
just
exactly
like
it's
worth
it
in
the
act,
officers,
agents
and
employees
of
such
carrier.
a
carrier
from
whom
--
for
whom
the
injured
person
is
working.
if
he's
injured
because
of
the
negligence
of
his
co-employees,
to
the
officers
of
the
company
he
is
working
for
or
the
agents
of
the
company
is
working
for,
then
he
comes
under
this
act
otherwise
he
does
not.
if
he's
an
agent
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
all
right.
pardon
what
is
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
that
is
answered
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
also
in
our
brief.
because
the
application
by
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
railway
company
joined
in
by
all
the
other
railroads,
santa
fe,
missouri
pacific,
fort
worth
and
denver
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
permission
to
enter
into
this
contract
whereby
the
terminal
was
to
do
the
switching
of
these
roads
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
approval
amounted
to
a
limitation
of
their
responsibility
under
that
act.
they
didn't
have
to
do
the
switching.
now,
in
the
state
of
texas,
we
have
to
go
to
the
railroad
commission.
they
went
to
the
railroad
commission
and
it
was
approved
there.
this
corporation
in
addition
to
that
was
incorporated
under
the
statutory
laws
of
texas,
incorporated
and
they
were
entitled
by
which
of
that
franchise
of
that
incorporation
to
engage
in
terminal
and
switching
facilities.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
operations.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well
that
would
depend,
i
think,
whether
the
carriers
had
terminated.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
and
--
and
while
the
train
was
being
pulled
in?
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
yes,
i
think
you'd
have
a
right
of
action
against
the
carrier.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
all
right.
he
--
he
might
maintain
a
suit
but
he
couldn't
bring
it
under
this
act,
your
honor,
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
because
that
doesn't
cover
it.
the
act
is
very
explicit
as
to
the
persons
who
it
covers.
now
he
--
he
had
--
he
could
bring
a
suit
at
common
law.but
he
couldn't
bring
it
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
neither
could
the
passengers,
they're
not
--
no,
yes.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
it's
certain
that
under
the
law
of
the
houston
belt
and
terminal
railway
company
has
been
given
the
right
to
do
the
switching
charges.
the
respondent
companies
forth
worth
and
denver
has
been
given
the
right
to
contact
with
the
employers
performances
of
that
service.
they
are
therefore
within
their
rights
in
doing
it
and
they
have
delegated
the
duty
under
the
law,
and
they
are
not
doing
anything
illegal
in
letting
the
switching
carrier
do
that
service.
it's
all
done
according
to
the
law
approved
by
every
agency
that's
created
for
such
approval.
thank
you.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
well,
i
--
i've
noted
here
the
passages
in
the
record
where
all
of
those
matter
--
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
and
the
point
is
that
as
the
beaumont
court
pointed
out
--
i
say,
the
beaumont
court
of
course
they
refused.
they
refer
it
in
texas,
the
beaumont
court
because
--
now
they
--
they
correctly
conclude
that
statements
that
your
honor
read
are
largely
conclusions
of
the
pleading.
they
say
you
have
to
read
into
these
provisions
the
law
applicable
to
it.
and
we
know
that
in
the
contract.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
may
i?
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
i
challenge
it.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
yes,
we
have
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
roy
l.
arterbury
now,
i
just
want
to
add
this.
when
you
say
that
some
of
the
officers
work
for
the
terminal
or
the
belt
without
compensation,
there's
no
officer
who
performs
a
real
working
service
(inaudible)
in
other
words
the
president
of
the
santa
fe
was
for
several
years
president
of
the
belt.
he
received
no
compensation
because
he
lives
in
denver.he
came
down
there
just
once
a
year.
