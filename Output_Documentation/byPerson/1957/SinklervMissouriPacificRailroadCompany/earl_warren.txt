a

how
about

are
there
some
place
that
--
the
missouri
pacific
have
the
right
to
discharge
employees
--
chief

--
idea
that
they
had
--
they
had
some
authority
to
direct
as
to
which
shipping
should
be
done
first
and
the
order
of
which
it
was

(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arterbury,
let's
--
let
me
just
read
to
you
something
from
the
petition
--
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
because
i
--
because
what
i
have
in
mind
about
control
and
maybe
--
maybe
when
we
conclude
tomorrow
morning
you
could
respond
to
it.
the
fact
that
the
respondent
owned
50%
of
the
belt
stock
and
appointed
four
of
his
directors,
record
107
and
124,
that
various
employees
of
respondent
served
also
sometime
without
additional
compensation
as
the
employees
of
belt,
record
139,
162,
176.
that
respondent
reserved
the
right
to
demand
the
discharge
of
any
belt
employee
obnoxious
to
it,
record
112,
that
the
respondent
insisted
that
belt's
team
track
should
not
be
opened
to
other
railroads
in
competition
with
respondent
even
though
belt
might
thereby
gain
revenue.
record
181
and
182,
that
the
respondent
admitted
in
pleadings
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
that
if
and
the
other
stockholding
lines
jointly
controlled
them
that
respondent
along
with
other
stockholding
lines
of
belt
procured
the
findings
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
with
the
relationship
between
the
respondent
and
belt
at
the
time
of
the
accident
was
one
of
agency
in
the
state
of
a
vigorous
--
in
the
face
of
a
vigorous
protest
by
the
texas
and
new
orleans
railroad
company,
one
of
the
competitors,
and
the
other
fact
that
belt
is
nothing
more
than
an
instrumentality
of
responsibility,
the
other
stockholding
lines
created,
permit,
perform
switching
the
terminal
operations
and
so
--
so
forth
all
furnished
aptly
supported.
now
those
are
the
things
that
i
have
in
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
question.

mr.
arterbury,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
has
the
--
has
the
respondent
in
this
case
ever
referred
to
this
belt
line
as
the
agent
of
the
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was
definitely
represented
in
this
case
that
they
have.
i
thought
it
was
in
the
briefs
--
in
the
record
that
they
--
that
they
have
referred
to
the
belt
line
as
the
agent
of
the
respondent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
--
were
they
using
it
in
the
ordinary
sense
or
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
they
use
--
why
didn't
they
use
other
words
like
superintendents.
you
have
a
good
many
different
kinds
of
superintendents.
you
have
superintendents
promoted
power,
you
have
superintendents
of
divisions,
you
have
superintendents
in
various
kinds
in
your
railroad
-(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
say
officers,
superintendents,
agents,
employees
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
--
you
finish
the
answer.
then
you
have
to
answer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
justice
whittaker's
question
to
answer
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
using
the
same
sense
as
though
they
said
officers,
conductors,
(voice
overlap)
agents
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
would
you
get
to
--
your
time
is
up,
but
would
you
get
to
justice
whittaker's
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
sir,
you
never
did
get
to
my
question
of
what
i
asked
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
they're
all
noted
in
the
--
they're
all
noted
in
the
petition
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
about
reading
any
law.
i'm
talking
about
the
facts.
in
the
first
place,
the
respondent
owned
50%
of
the
belt
stock
and
appointed
four
of
its
directors.
and
the
various
employees
of
respondent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
served
also
some
times
without
additional
compensation
as
employees
and
so
forth.
i'm
just
asking
you
if
that
is
a
correct
statement
or
if
you
challenge
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
challenge
within
your
response.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
--
then
all
right.
then
i'll
read
it
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
weren't
interested
in
the
santa
fe,
i
was
only
interested
in
the
missouri
pacific
because
they're
the
--
they're
the
respondent
in
this
--
in
this
case.
but
never
mind,
i'll
--
i'll
read
it
from
--
from
the
records
if
you
please.
