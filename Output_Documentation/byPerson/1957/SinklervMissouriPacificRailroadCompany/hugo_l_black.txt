the
language
of
the

justice

the

and
you

within
the

of

justice

l.
black
don't
they
have
a

that
--
that
the
railroad
has
a
contract
with
belt
that
it
can
fire
his

determining
incompetent

justice

do
not
--
does
not
--
do
not
--
the
railroad
stockholders
of
belt
have
a
contract,
once
they
get
(inaudible)
that
they
can
discharge,
they
can
dismiss
any

and
stockholders
if
they

--
railroad
anything
(inaudible)
justice

do
they

justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

l.
black
there
hasn't
any
every

justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
railroad
can
make
it
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
way
they
run
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
railroad
--
suppose
this
railroad
what
makes
it
a
sub-contractor
with
an
agent
that
runs
its
engines
and
the
employees
have
got
injured
by
reason
--
or
other
employees
are
injured
by
reason
of
the
negligence
of
the
contractors,
running
the
engine
around
this
country,
can
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
railroad
system,
but
to
do
its
work
--
it's
operating
through
independent
contractors
that
thereby
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
fela
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
one
part
here
and
one
part
there
and
the
fela
not
have
filed,
can
they
do
that?
now,
sub-contracts
told
them
all
sub-contractors
operate
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
50%
of
its
operation.
so
have
somebody
else
to
meet
50%
of
its
operation
but
in
effect
every
employee
worked
in
the
road
and
(inaudible),
can
they
do
that?
they'll
be
able
to
escape
liability
as
a
railroad
or
the
interest
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
can
they
delegate
of
the
operation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
simply
not
--
not
covered
by
the
fela.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it
be
covered
if
you
just
said
agents,
officers
or
employees?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have.
then
the
agent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
agent
as
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
because
i'm
not
sure.
who
employs
the
railway
mail
agents?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
hires
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
works
on
the
train?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
injure
one
of
the
other
employees
as
to
that
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
been
passed
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
while
he
performed
services?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
have
you
any
case
--
have
you
had
any
cases
where
their
negligence
brought
about
the
injury
of
any
federal
--
any
railroad
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
act
plainly
says
that
he
has
to
be
employed
by
the
carrier
in
such
commerce
in
order
to
recover,
that
you're
saying
that
the
express
agent
is
not
employed
by
the
company
and
therefore
he
couldn't
recover
from
the
company
even
though
he's
injured.
what
i'm
asking
is
have
you
any
cases
where
due
to
the
negligence
of
an
express
agent
in
carrying
on
his
duties
on
the
train
of
the
negligence
of
a
railway
mail
agent
that
the
company
would
not
be
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
he
was
not
employed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
come
under
the
languages
of
act
which
is
not
under
consideration
here
which
said
they
should
be
liable
in
damage
to
any
person
suffering
injury
while
he
is
employed
by
such
carrier.
and
it
was
held
that
did
not
include
a
right
to
--
did
not
give
a
person
who's
not
employed
with
the
carrier
a
right
to
sue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
it
can't
be
because
while
the
act
says
the
company's
liable
for
the
negligence
of
an
officer,
agent
or
employee,
in
reality
it
means
that
the
company's
only
liable
for
the
negligence
of
its
officers
or
its
employees.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
same
as
employee
and
we
have
to
read
it
out
of
the
act,
it
does
mean
nothing.
it
adds
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
adds
nothing
to
it
and
it
takes
nothing
from
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
if
he's
servant
or
officer
of
the
railroad
