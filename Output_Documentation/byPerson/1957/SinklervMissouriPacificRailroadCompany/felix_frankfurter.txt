mr.
ryan,
how
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
long
ago
is
the
antiquity
of
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
give
me
personal
concept
of
that
method?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
in
the
relations
between
the
carrier
--
between
petitioner's
employer
in
the
belt
line
and
the
basis
of
recovery
is
part
of
the
relation
between
those
who
are
negligent
and
the
victim
of
their
negligence.
that
doesn't
rest
on
any
particular
doctrine
growing
out
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
part
of
the
common
law
of
negligence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
light
of
that,
would
you
mind
commenting
on
the
texas
cases
that
are
cited
on
top
of
page
109.
i
don't
know
anything
about
it
but
they
all
seemed
to
be
texas
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
require
--
would
that
require
the
approval
of
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
bound
to
say
--
i'm
bound
to
say
doesn't
seem
to
be
making
any
difference.
for
your
part,
whether
for
a
reason
pertaining
to
railroad
such
as
switching
of
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
commission
or
not
so
long
as
the
switching
of
it
actually
made
was
not
advised
soon
from
what
you
say
that
this
wasn't
illegal.
was
this
illegal,
mr.
ryan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wondered
what
--
what
the
distinction
is
(inaudible)
that
you
candidly
say
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
approval
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
otherwise
relieve
an
employer
or
the
railroad
employees
for
tort
liability
which
otherwise
in
the
manner
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
could
under
your
common
law
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
third
party
--
if
a
third
party
--
if
without
justification,
an
employee
of
the
missouri
pacific
(inaudible)
or
whether
he
could
or
couldn't
would
that
--
by
what
law
will
cover
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
fact
that
your
case
in
effect
that
the
--
that
the
employees
of
the
belt
line
or
fellow
employees,
that's
where
it
gets
down
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
ad
ho
--
who
were
ad
hoc
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
transaction
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
under
texas
law
who
determines
whether
the
belt
line
was
his
agent
or
is
this
a
question
of
texas
law
whether
there
is
or
not
or
the
federal
law,
is
a
question
for
the
jury,
is
that
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
submit
it
--
passed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
guys
sue
under
federal
employers'
liability
act
then
it
would
have
to
be
under
the
federal
law
of
the
state
court
that
they're
not
agents.
we
can't
independently
here
overrule
the
court
of
appeals
and
if
by
determination
they
were
not
agents
unless
that's
a
federal
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
carrier
can't
hire
switching
agents
--
can't
hire
a
switching
company?
an
independent
switching
company
can
do
the
switching?
there
must
be
a
lot
of
non-delegation
--
non-delegable
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
passengers
that
is
non-delegable
duty
towards
near
the
passengers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
all
the
railroads
in
this
country
which
have
switching
companies
doing
the
switching
allowed
them
to
the
passengers
and
to
their
employees
for
the
comment
of
a
switching
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
divest
itself
for
its
liability
to
the
pullman
employee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
sounds
like
this
--
the
passenger
is
not
an
employee
of
the
railroad
when
it
(inaudible)
it
has
a
court
liability
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
contest
that
whatever
is
non-delegable
as
employees
may
not
delegable
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
depends
on
what
the
obligation
as
a
franchise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
the
railroad
and
the
railroad
franchise
doesn't
mean
it
does
a
lot
of
subsidiary
services
in
connection
with
freight
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
read
that
there's
a
reason
amendment
(inaudible)
--
its
allowance
and
requirement
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
authorizes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
arterbury,
how
are
you
going
to
expose
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

i

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
train
is
switching
operations
(inaudible)
justice
felix

all
right.
now
then,
in
that
situation
while
