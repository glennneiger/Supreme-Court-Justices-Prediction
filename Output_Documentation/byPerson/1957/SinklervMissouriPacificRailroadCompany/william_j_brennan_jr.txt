j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
question
about
anything
except
whether
or
not
(inaudible)
illegal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
question
of
negligence
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
in
fact
the
belt
line
is
agent
for
the
purpose
of
the
statutes
and
the
verdict
should
be
reinstated,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ryan,
if
this
language
were
not
in
the
fela,
officers,
agents
or
employees,
are
you
suggesting
that
did
not
the
liability
under
the
first
proposition
you
argued
of
non-delegable
duty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
that.
suppose
all
of
--
if
the
section
51
did
not
have
these
words.
it
says
negligence
of
the
railroad
or
of
any
officers,
agents
or
employees
because
it
did
not
have
the
language
officers,
agents
or
employee
but
merely
negligence
to
the
carrier
and
that's
the
way
it
read.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought
you'd
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
isn't
--
isn't
it
non-delegable
for
the
reason
that
it
has
the
franchise
to
perform
and
run
a
railroad
and
to
kept
--
escape
its
obligations
by
parceling
out
parts
of
the
job
while
running
a
railroad
other
than
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
your
ticket
agent
and
the
station
agent
is
actually
an
employee
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
use
--
use
both
words
to
mean
the
same
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they're
--
they
are
also
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
suggesting
that
--
