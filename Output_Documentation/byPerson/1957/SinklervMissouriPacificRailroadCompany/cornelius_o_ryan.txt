mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
i'm
ready
for
the
petitioner,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
petitioner,
parris
sinkler,
was
the
cook
on
the
private
car
assigned
to
the
general
manager
of
the
respondent,
railroad.
that
car
came
into
the
union
station
in
houston
on
march
30th,
1949
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
respondent's
trains.
after
it
arrived
in
the
station
while
the
petitioner
was
still
aboard
the
car
performing
the
duties
of
his
employment,
the
car
was
switched
from
one
track
to
another
within
the
station.
in
the
course
of
that
switching
movement,
and
because
of
the
negligence
of
the
crew
handling
the
car,
the
petitioner
was
injured.
now,
the
crew
handling
the
car
as
the
record
shows,
were
employees
of
houston
belt
and
terminal
railway
company,
which
is
a
corporation,
separate
from
respondent
although
affiliated
within
a
number
of
ways.
respondent
owned
50%
of
its
stock
and
appointed
in
effect
four
of
its
eight
directors,
that
is
50%
of
them,
and
there
were
a
number
of
common
employees.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
i
do,
your
honor,
yes.
there
were
a
number
of
affiliations
between
respondent
and
houston
belt
and
terminal
which
we
will
go
into
in
more
detail
later.
now,
petitioner
continued
to
work
after
his
accident
being
off
for
some
months
about
a
year
after
it
in
order
to
have
an
operation
to
repair
some
of
the
effects
of
it,
but
he
went
back
to
work
and
continued
to
work
on
his
car.
he
did
not
consult
counsel
until
more
than
two
years
after
the
accident,
and
he
then
discovered
that
any
action
by
him
against
houston
belt
and
terminal
railway
company,
which
would
have
of
course
to
be
a
common
law
action
in
the
state
courts
of
texas,
was
barred
by
the
texas
two-year
statute
of
limitations.but
his
action
against
his
employer
under
the
three-year
limitation
statute
applicable
to
the
employers'
liability
act
was
still
open
to
him
since
less
than
three
years
had
passed.he,
therefore,
filed
this
suit
less
than
three
years
after
the
accident.
now,
the
respondent's
only
defense
which
is
now
material
is
that
houston
belt
and
terminal's
employees
were
the
negligent
ones,
that
houston
belt
and
terminal
railway
company
was,
as
to
the
respondent,
an
independent
contractor,
and
that
therefore,
respondent
was
not
liable
for
the
negligence
of
the
switching
crew
and
not
liable
for
petitioner's
injuries.
petitioner
obtained
a
judgment
in
the
district
court
of
harris
county,
texas,
upon
a
jury
verdict
which
among
other
things
found
expressly
upon
special
issues
submitted
under
the
texas
practice
that
houston
belt
and
terminal
was
respondent's
agent
and
was
not
an
independent
contractor
in
performing
the
movement
in
question.
that
judgment
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals
at
beaumont
on
appeal
and
judgment
was
there
rendered
that
petitioner
take
nothing
against
the
respondent.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
$15,000,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
on
appeal
about
the
amount
of
the
verdict
and
there
was
no
question
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
about
the
amount
of
it.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
no
question
of
negligence
or
anything
else.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
right.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
insofar
as
i
can
understand
it,
appears
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
belt
here
was
an
independent
contractor
and
that
respondent
was
therefore
not
liable
for
the
negligence
of
the
switching
crew.
our
position
here
is
three-fold.
we
say
first
that
respondent
is
liable
to
petitioner
for
injuries
caused
to
him
while
he
was
in
the
course
of
his
employment
by
the
persons
who
are
performing
respondent's
switching
regardless
of
the
precise
legal
relationship
between
them,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
by
the
usual
rules
they
might
be
deemed
independent
contractors
rather
than
agents.
we
say
further
that
there
is
no
contract
in
evidence
in
this
case
which
makes
the
belt
an
independent
contractor
while
performing
switching
for
respondent.
but
if
there
were
such
contract,
it
would
not
affect
the
petitioner's
rights
because
it
would
fall
within
the
prohibition
of
section
5
of
the
employers'
liability
act
expressly
providing
that
any
contract
or
device
whatsoever
which
will
enable
a
common
carrier
to
avoid
its
liability
under
the
act
is
to
that
extent
void.
and
we
say,
finally,
that
the
question
of
whether
belt
in
performing
this
movement
was
an
agent
or
an
independent
contractor
was
resolved
against
the
respondent
by
the
jury's
verdict,
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
that
verdict,
and
that
the
court
of
civil
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
to
reverse
the
judgment
based
on
that
verdict,
whether
or
not
it
agreed
with
the
jury
about
the
facts
found.
now,
the
first
main
ground
on
which
we
rely,
and
the
one
i
think
that
is
really
most
important
for
the
disposition
of
this
case
is
simply
that
the
respondent
is
liable
to
petitioner
for
injuries
suffered
by
the
petitioner
in
the
course
of
his
employment
when
those
injuries
are
due
to
the
negligence
of
persons
performing
the
respondent's
switching.
now,
we
say
that
that
has
always
been
the
case
both
under
the
employers'
liability
act
and
that
common
law
before
the
passage
of
the
act.
the
case
precisely
in
point,
of
considerable
antiquity,
which
is
cited
and
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
i
say
that
it
is
enough.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
my
point
is
this,
that
when
the
respondent,
the
missouri
pacific,
entrust
the
performance
of
its
switching
to
the
crew,
the
houston
belt
and
terminal,
and
the
negligence
of
that
crew
injures
petitioner
while
he
is
working
as
an
employee
of
the
missouri
pacific,
then
the
missouri
pacific
is
liable
to
him
for
that
negligence
regardless
of
whether
or
not
from
other
standpoints,
the
crew
of
the
belt
might
be
considered
agents
or
independent
contractor
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
non-delegability,
precisely,
your
honor.
now,
in
the
case
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago,
floody
versus
great
northern
railway
and
others
from
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
which
was
a
case
decided
prior
to
the
employers'
liability
act
and
which
does
not
relate
to
federal
law
but
simply
to
the
common
law
on
the
subject,
the
facts
were
almost
precisely
the
same
as
they
are
here.
in
that
case,
floody,
the
plaintiff,
was
employed
by
the
omaha
railway,
and
while
he
was
taking
one
of
its
engines
out
of
the
union
depot
in
st.
paul,
the
engine
was
wrecked
and
he
was
injured
because
of
the
negligence
of
a
crew
throwing
a
switch
that
the
engine
had
to
pass
over.
now,
his
employer
there
raised
the
same
defense
that
respondent
raised
here.
it
said
the
union
depot
company
is
a
separate
corporation.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
that,
we
have
a
merely
contractual
relationship
with
it.
the
crew
which
threw
this
switch
improperly
consisted
of
employees
of
the
union
depot
company
paid
by
it,
given
instructions
by
it.
we
have
no
control
over
them,
whatever.
therefore,
we
are
not
responsible
to
floody
for
the
negligence
of
that
crew.
but
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
said
it
does
not
matter
to
the
plaintiff
here
whether
or
not
the
crew,
which
threw
the
switch,
and
which
caused
his
injuries
were
employees
of
his
employer
or
employees
of
union
depot
company,
a
separate
corporation.
his
employer
is
liable
to
him
for
their
negligence
because
the
employer
chose
to
make
use
of
their
services
upon
that
occasion
in
order
to
get
his
train
out
of
the
station.
and
we
say
the
situation
is
precisely
the
same
here.
the
missouri
pacific
chose
to
avail
itself
of
the
services
of
houston
belt
and
terminal
switching
crews
at
houston.
the
record
shows
that
it
employed
no
switching
crews
of
its
own.
it
had
all
of
its
switching
in
the
union
station
done
by
houston
belt
and
terminal
crews.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
as
respects
to
this
plaintiff,
yes,
your
honor.
now
of
course
there
are
--
there
are
other
questions
that
could
be
involved
which
we
don't
go
into.
but
as
respects
to
this
plaintiff,
his
employer
is
liable
to
him
for
injuries
caused
in
the
course
of
his
employment
by
the
negligence
of
the
persons
doing
his
employer's
switching,
regardless
of
what
precise
arrangements
his
employer
may
have
made
to
have
that
switching
done.
and
we
say
that
this
case
is
simply
on
all
force
with
the
floody
case,
that
it
cannot
be
distinguished
and
i
don't
think
that
respondent
has
actually
attempted
to
distinguish
it.
respondent's
whole
argument,
as
i
understand
it
on
this
point,
is
briefly
this,
that
in
several
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act,
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
sue
under
it,
a
plaintiff
must
be
an
employee
of
a
common
carrier.
that
term
is
understood
in
a
conventional
sense.
for
instance,
in
robinson
versus
the
b&o,
a
pullman
porter
could
not
sue
the
b&o
for
his
injuries
because
he
was
not
the
railroad's
employee.
he
was
the
employee
for
the
pullman
company.
and
there
have
been
several
other
cases
to
the
same
effect.
respondent
here
attempts
to
say
that
to
draw
the
inference
from
those
cases
that
since
the
employees
of
the
belt
may
not
have
been
employees
of
respondent,
so
as
to
be
entitled
to
sue
respondent,
if
they
should
be
injured,
that
the
respondent
is
not
liable
for
their
negligence.
in
other
words,
they
are
not
only
not
employees
but
they
are
not
servants
or
agents
of
any
description.
now,
we
think
that
the
inference
attempted
to
be
drawn
is
obviously
faulty.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
petitioner
is
respondent's
employee.
he
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act.
he
is
entitled
to
sue
under
it.
so
that
at
all
those
cases
which
go
off
on
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
is
not
an
employee
of
the
defendant
and
is
therefore
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
situation
in
which
the
petitioner
is
the
employee
of
the
respondent
and
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act
and
entitled
to
sue
under
it.
we
say
that
the
floody
case
and
the
principles
it
lays
down
rather
than
robinson
versus
b&o
are
governing.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
robinson
versus
b&o,
the
court
saw
as
a
matter
of
dicta
this
--
this
point
which
i'm
making
here,
because
in
the
opinion
of
that
case,
after
holding
that
the
pullman
porter
was
not
an
employee
and
was
not
entitled
to
sue
under
the
act,
it
went
on
to
say
it
would
be
absurd
that
the
question
is
not
whether
the
railroad
company
by
virtue
of
its
duty
to
passengers
of
which
it
cannot
divest
itself
by
any
arrangement
with
the
sleeping
car
company
would
not
be
liable
for
the
negligence
of
a
sleeping
car
porter
in
matters
involving
the
passenger's
safety.
in
other
words,
the
sleeping
car
porter
could
not
sue
the
railroad
as
its
employee
under
the
act,
but
nevertheless,
the
railroad
might
be
liable
to
third
parties
for
his
negligence.
he
would
be
an
agent
for
whose
acts
--
for
whose
negligent
acts
the
railroad
company
could
be
liable.
now,
another
case
which
we
think
is
fair
--
in
point
on
the
facts,
although
it
does
not
involve
a
railroad
employee,
is
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe
railway
company
versus
shelton
from
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
that
too
is
a
case
of
some
antiquity
and
was
decided
by
a
court
composed
of
justices
burt,
gaines,
brown
and
williams,
which
i
think
justice
clark
will
agree
with
me,
is
generally
recognized
as
having
been
one
of
the
ablest
supreme
courts
ever
to
sit
in
texas.
in
that
case
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
they
sat
in
the
early
part
of
this
century,
your
honor.
they
decided
this
case
in
about
1906
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
as
we
use
precedence
these
days,
your
honor,
they
are
of
some
antiquity.
i
think
that
the
term
was
necessarily
viewed
in
extremely
relative
sense
of
course.
i'm
getting
the
point
where
50
years
doesn't
seem
like
antiquity.
it
should
be
anymore,
i
can
assure
you.
there,
the
plaintiff
was
a
passenger
on
a
train
of
the
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe
railway
company.
he
was
injured
in
the
yards
of
purcell,
oklahoma
by
the
negligence
of
a
switching
crew
composed
of
employees
of
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe
railway
company.
that
crew
at
that
point,
performed
as
a
switching
crew
for
both
railroads.
and
the
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe
simply
paid
the
atchison
company
a
portion
of
the
expense.
now
in
that
case,
the
trial
court
--
the
district
court
had
instructed
the
jury
as
a
matter
of
law
that
since
the
switching
crew
employed
by
the
atchison
company
performed
the
work
of
a
switching
crew
for
the
gulf
company.
the
gulf
was
liable
for
their
negligence,
if
any,
which
might
have
injured
the
plaintiff.
the
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
was
again
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
the
court
held,
as
i
construe
the
opinion
that
quite
consistently
with
the
floody
case,
the
fact
that
the
gulf,
colorado
and
santa
fe
had
availed
itself
of
the
services
of
that
switching
crew,
made
that
switching
crew
as
far
as
the
plaintiff
was
concerned,
the
servants
or
agents
of
the
gulf
company.
so,
the
gulf
company
was
liable
for
their
negligence
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
conceded
that
the
atchison
company
had
selected
and
paid
these
men,
that
they
were
on
its
payroll,
and
that
all
gulf
did
was
to
contribute
a
portion
of
the
expense
of
running
the
yard
at
purcell.
now,
we
say
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
any
later
case,
there
is
nothing
in
the
employers'
liability
act,
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
which
would
commit,
permit
or
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
can
escape
liability
simply
because
it
may
have
made
a
contract
with
another
company
for
the
performance
of
switching
service.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
your
honor,
they're
all
--
they're
all
texas
cases
and
they
just
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
point
in
issue.
now
frankly,
i
cannot
--
i
could
not
understand
them
myself
or
the
relevancy
of
them.
there
is
one
which
in
one
view
of
the
case
has
some
relevance,
but
the
respondent
has
not
chosen
to
urge
it
here.
that
is
a.t.&
w.t.
railway
company
versus
anderson,
120
texas.
that
is
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
back
about
25
years
ago.
it
held
that
when
one
railroad
leased
its
line
to
another
railroad
under
an
arrangement
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
covered
by
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
then
the
lessor
railroad
was
no
longer
responsible
for
the
torts
of
the
employees
of
the
lessee
railroad,
here
a
passenger
had
been
injured
by
a
conductor
and
he
sued
the
lessor
railroad
and
the
court
held
he
couldn't
recover
against
the
lessor
railroad.
now,
respondent
might
have
attempted
to
stretch
that
case
in
this
court
to
cover
this
situation.
significantly
enough,
they
haven't
done
so
in
their
brief.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
distinction
is
clear.
if
there
had
been
an
evidence
here,
a
contract
between
the
respondent
and
the
belt
expressly
turning
over
all
of
the
switching
to
belt,
there
were
no
such
contract
in
evidence.
but
if
there
had
been
and
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
approved
the
contract
and
had
issued
a
certificate
of
pubic
convenience
and
necessity
covering
the
operations
under
it,
then
you
might
have
here
the
same
question
that
was
present
in
the
anderson
case.
but
the
distinction
is
that
none
of
those
things
are
here
present.
there
was
no
contract
approved
in
this
case
for
the
performance
of
switching
by
the
belt
and
there
was
no
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
it
is
now.
it
was
not
at
the
time
this
contract
was
first
entered
into.
there
is
in
the
record,
your
honor,
evidence
of
and
references
to
a
contract
which
went
into
effect
between
belt
and
respondent
on
june
1st,
1950,
more
than
a
year
after
this
accident.
now
that
contract
was
submitted
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
execution
of
it
was
authorized
and
the
operations
under
it
were
covered
by
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
why
it
should
be
illegal.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
because
that
case,
your
honor,
based
its
decision
precisely
upon
the
point
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
approved
this
arrangement
and
that
therefore
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
i
don't
think
it
could,
your
honor
but
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
texas
held
that
it
did
relieve
of
liability
to
a
passenger
--
not
to
be
perfectly
candid
about
it.
that's
what
they
said
so
that
--
i
am
stuck
with
that
decision.
but
i
do
not
believe
it
has
any
relevance
in
this
case.
now
one
point
also
that
is
of
some
of
interest
is
that
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
for
the
missouri
pacific
railroad
company,
your
honor.
he
was
the
cook
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
no,
sir.
he
cannot.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
no,
sir.
he
had
no
other
employer.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
he
could
have
sued
the
h.b.and
t.
in
the
common
law
action
in
texas
within
two
years
after
the
date
of
the
accident,
your
honor.
he
didn't
know
that
until
he
consulted
a
lawyer
and
it
was
already
too
late.
now,
one
significant
thing
we
think
is
that
the
new
--
the
contract
which
went
into
effect
june
1st,
1950
between
belt
and
respondent
which
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
expressly
recited
that
belt
would
perform
all
switching
for
respondent
as
its
agent.
and
as
the
proceedings
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
show,
we've
made
reference
to
them
in
the
briefs
in
the
record,
the
parties
then
took
the
position
and
the
commission
agreed
with
them
that
the
relationship
prior
to
that
time
had
been
one
of
agency,
that
we
put
that
into
to
convince
the
jury
that
the
relationship
actually
was
one
of
agency.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
brief
printed
as
an
appendix,
page
21
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
he
would
sue
the
third
party,
your
honor.
now,
unless
there
was
something
which
--
which
made
the
employer
responsible
for
the
third
party's
actions,
he
could
not
sue
under
the
fela.
he
can
sue
under
the
fela
only
for
some
negligence
of
the
employer
or
his
agents,
servants
or
employees.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
no,
it
does
not
get
down
quite
to
that,
your
honor.
we
say
that
the
employees
of
the
belt
line,
when
performing
services
for
the
respondent
or
the
agents
of
the
respondent
as
far
as
the
plaintiff
is
concerned
here.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
you
put
that
in
that
--
in
that
--
in
that
particular
context,
yes,
your
honor
there
would
be.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
in
reference
to
that
particular
transaction,
they
would
be
fellow
servants
of
his,
yes,
for
whose
negligence.
of
course,
the
employer
is
expressly
liable
and
always
has
been
under
the
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
i
think
in
this
case,
it
was
a
question
for
the
jury
your
honor.
it
was
a
question
of
fact
about
whether
they
were
agents
on
--
in
this
situation.
we
submitted
it
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
found
them.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
understand
its
opinion
apparently
said
that
there
wasn't
any
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
finding
and
reversed
and
rendered
for
that
reason.
we
say
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
it
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
would
take
the
same
view
of
that
evidence
as
the
jury
did
as
immaterial.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
your
honor,
that
the
person's
causing
the
injury
whereas
to
the
--
as
to
the
petitioner,
the
agents
of
his
employer
here.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
yes.
it
would
be
a
federal
question,
your
honor,
i
agree.
but
i
think
they
were
--
they
were
agents
anyway
without
respect
to
any
federal
question
or
federal
law
instead
under
the
common
law
they
were
agents
for
that
--
for
that
purpose.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
since
the
–
the
act
expressly
uses
the
term
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
i
agree,
your
honor.
if
i
said
anything
contrary
to
start
with,
i
was
wrong.
it
is
a
federal
question.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
of
course
at
this
language
we're
not
in
the
fela
then
i
presumed
there
wouldn't
be
any
fela,
your
honor
and
he
would
better
sue
under
texas
law.
if
the
fela
didn't
exist
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
i
say
that
the
result
would
be
the
same.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
there
still
would
be
negligent
to
the
carrier.
i
think
the
original
reason
to
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
it
can
do
that,
your
honor
but
it
simply
does
not
relieve
it
of
its
liability
to
its
own
employees
or
injured
by
the
negligence
of
that
switching
carrier.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
precisely,
your
honor
as
the
court
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well,
your
honor
ordinarily
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
yes,
that's
precisely
true.
that
--
that
is
what
the
--
the
texas
court
said
in
the
--
the
shelton
case
that
the
--
the
fact
that
the
gulf
had
made
an
arrangement
with
somebody
else
to
do
its
switching
did
not
relieve
it
--
of
its
liability
to
its
passengers.
in
robinson
versus
b&o,
the
court
says
that
--
that
by
making
an
arrangement
with
the
pullman
company,
the
railroad
cannot
divest
itself
of
its
liability
to
its
passengers.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
but
it
never
had
any
liability
to
the
pullman
employee
because
he
was
not
its
employee
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
but
it
has
--
it
has
a
liability
to
passengers
and
to
its
employees
to
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
say
here
that
if
it
were
necessary
to
go
that
far
that
the
respondent
would
be
liable
to
passengers
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
that's
it.
that's
precisely
it,
your
honor.
there's
a
paragraph
for
the
restatement
of
torts
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
lays
down
that
general
principle,
that
one
who
has
a
public
franchise
cannot
relieve
himself
of
tort
liability
by
employing
an
independent
contractor
to
perform
parts
of
it.
now
it
may
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well
the
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
well
--
but
it's
got
to
have
--
got
to
perform
switching
in
order
to
run
a
railroad,
your
honor.
that
is
a
part
of
its
function
of
transportation
as
we
view
it.
it
couldn't
get
along
without
switching
crews
at
houston
when
it's
running
in
and
out
of
houston.
it's
got
to
have
them
from
some
source.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
have
such
a
statute.
i
know
there
is
such
a
statute
in
missouri,
i
ran
into
it
in
briefing
this
case.
the
same
result
is
arrived
at--
in
--
in
texas
law.
the
--
the
texas
cases
have
held
for
generations
back
that
a
railroad
cannot
relieve
itself
of
its
responsibility
for
running
a
railroad
by
leasing
to
another
except
with
the
approval
of
the
legislature.
in
the
early
days,
our
railroads
were
all
incorporated
by
special
acts
of
the
legislature.and
when
the
question
arose
in
those
days,
it
was
held
that
a
special
act
of
the
legislature
was
necessary
to
relieve
the
lessor
of
its
obligation
to
run
a
railroad.
it
couldn't
simply
make
a
contract
with
the
lessee.
it
may
be
that
now
that
merely
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
it
would
be
necessary
for
that.
that's
what
a.t.and
w.t.
versus
anderson
is
hitting
at.
but
that
simply
doesn't
have
any
relation
to
this
case.
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
it
is
my
--
it
is
my
understanding,
your
honor
that
the
transportation
act
of
1920
--
mr.
cornelius
o.
ryan
authorized
and
gave
the
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction
over
arrangement
such
as
this
--
with
the
--
thank
you.
