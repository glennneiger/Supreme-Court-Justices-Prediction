before
justice
harlan
interrupted
you,
if
i'm
--
i
understood
you
indicated
that
322
does
something
affirmative
rather
make
the
reservation
of
a
preexisting
common
law
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
thinking
that
--
that
after
first
322,
is
the
same
permission
(inaudible)
prior
to
the
322.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
if
one
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
that
they
have
their
money
and
don't
know
whether
they
have
the
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
pocket
it
or
keep
it,
they
have
to
do
something
about
it.
justice

is

right?(voice

before
you
argue
consequently.
is
that
true
that
if
you
--
if
the
government
is
right,
and
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't.
i
thought
that
was
(inaudible)
that
--
that
there
is
a
contingency.
where
it
gets
the
money,
it
must
make
appropriate
provision,
bookkeeping
or
whatnot,
to
keep
that
amount
of
money
in
reserve
because
non
constat,
there
has
--
it
has
to
prove
that
it
properly
sent
that
bill.
justice

(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
i've
asked
(inaudible)
i
thought
that
we
were
asked
to
review
this
because
it's
the
case
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
we're
talking
about
or
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
say
this
is
only
a
relative
small
fact,
that's
not
a
great
burden
on
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
isn't
anymore
out
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
it
practically
(inaudible)
practically
about
these
things,
what
it
--
justice

frankfurter
(inaudible)
every
voucher
would
have
to
be
independent
in
a
large

it
has
to
be
at
work?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

i
conceive
that
the
force
--
the
magnitude
of
this
problem
on
either
side.
that's
what
i'm
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sweeney,
may
i
ask
you
to
indicate
some
other
types
of
controversy
that
arise
between
the
railroad
--
the
carriers
and
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
shed
some
light
on
--
on
the
question
of
whether
it
is
--
this
is
merely
the
establishment
of
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
will
indicate
the
rule
of
going
forward.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
types
of
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
we
stop
a
minute
there.
that's
rather
a
question
of
law,
isn't
it?
(inaudible)
whether
--
whether
the
shipment
could
have
been
sent
over
land
grant
there
for
just
cheap
arrangements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
there's
no
--
you
keep
your
knowledge
on
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
classification,
you
mean,
classification
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
demurrage
problems?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
accounting
office
a
division
for
--
vis-à-vis
the
railroads?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they're
not
nice
--
nice,
this
isn't
restricted
to
that
particular
graph
of
the
accounting
office,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally
nice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
sweeney,
this
--
plainly
be
a
stupid
question,
but
didn't
the
government
made
this
claim
and
didn't
send
the
available
cheaper
car
--
cheaper
cost
cars,
they
must
have
had
some
basis
for
making
that
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
i'm
asking,
they
must
have
had
some.
they
don't
just
go
over
there
and
say,
“we
got
a
counterclaim.”
did
they
introduce
anything
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
have
had
some
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
that
--
that
doesn't
disprove
that
they're
nice
people,
but
it
doesn't
seem
some
other
things
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
this
is
by
authorization
of
the
icc.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
formal
order
or
just
an
understanding
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
it
is
by
a
formal
order
of
the
commission,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
would
you
--
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
little
--
apart
from
this
case,
there's
a
hiatus
there
if
it's
--
is
six
years
a
fair
gap
between
performance
and
post-audits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can
destroy,
if
the
commission
authorizes
destruction
of
carrier
documents
after
three
years,
is
that
all
for
the
limit?
where
was
the
burden
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
check
that
out,
wouldn't
you,
mr.
sweeney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
the
private
shipper
is
allowed
credit
if
he
maybe
--
the
situation
is
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
where
he
has
it,
it
is
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
theory
those
96
hours
of
some
shipments
that
are
--
uncontested
and
some
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
contested
then
he
can
do
the
same
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
to
whether
it
is
the
government's
contention
that
if
rule
34,
meaning
that
the
--
the
shorter
or
smaller,
whatever
they
are,
the
lighter
cars,
if
lighter
cars
are
ordered,
then
--
and
heavier
cars
are
rendered
that
--
that
in
itself
prove
the
violation
of
the
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
on
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
the
mere
furnishing
proof.
they
violated
the
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
during
the
war
it
might
be
the
other
way
around.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know
that
congress
was,
it
can
take
judicial
orders
to
the
--
the
year
in
which
this
happened
and
what
the
relationship
to
the
railroad
and
government
trade
was,
don't
need
any
evidence
on
that.
