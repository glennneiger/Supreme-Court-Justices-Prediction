mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit,
this
court
is
called
upon
to
determine
the
effect
of
section
322
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940
upon
the
traditional
obligation
of
common
carriers
to
establish
the
validity
of
their
claims
against
the
government.
section
322,
the
terms
of
which
are
set
forth
at
page
3
of
the
brief
of
the
united
states
and
which
is
before
this
court
last
year
in
the
western
pacific
case
requires,
the
government
to
pay
transportation
bills
upon
presentation
prior
to
audit
or
settlement
by
the
general
accounting
office.
the
section
goes
on,
however,
to
reserve
the
government
the
right,
should
a
post-audit
disclose
an
overpayment
to
deduct
the
amount
thereof
from
any
amount
subsequently
found
to
be
due
to
the
carrier.
now,
in
this
case,
the
government
paid
in
compliance
with
the
statutory
mandate
certain
bills
rendered
by
respondent
promptly
upon
presentation
without
any
audit.
on
the
post-audit,
and
the
general
accounting
office
questioned
the
correctness
of
these
bills.
when
the
respondent
failed
to
resolve
the
doubts
that
were
raised
in
this
regard
and
failed
to
make
a
refund
of
the
determined
overpayment,
a
deduction
was
made
as
authorized
by
the
statute
in
the
payment
of
a
subsequent
bill
rendered
by
respondent.
this
litigation
was
then
instituted
ostensibly
on
the
subsequent
bill
to
recover
the
deduction.
and
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
carrier
had
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
charges
for
these
shipments,
this
earlier
--
earlier
transportation
services,
were
correct.
in
other
words,
that
they
had
not
overcharged
the
government
on
the
bills
which
had
been
paid
without
audit
in
the
first
instance.
now,
the
underlying
facts
are
simply
stated
this.
during
1944,
the
government
ships
several
carloads
of
naval
property
to
points
on
respondent's
lines
in
massachusetts
and
rhode
island.
in
each
instance
the
bill
of
lading
called
for
an
open
freight
car
of
a
particular
length.
in
each
instance,
the
initial
carriers
supplied
a
freight
car
of
a
longer
length
which
was
unnecessary
for
the
particular
services.
and
in
rendering
its
bills,
the
respondent
computed
each
charges
on
the
basis
of
the
minimum
weights
fixed
for
the
larger
car
furnished
rather
than
for
the
cars
which
had
been
ordered.
on
the
post-audit,
these
facts
came
to
light.
because
no
showing
was
made
by
respondent
that
the
initial
carrier
had
been
unable
to
supply
the
ordered
cars,
which
are
the
only
circumstances
concededly
in
which
it
could
bill
for
the
longer
furnished
cars,
the
general
accounting
office
requested
a
refund
between
the
charges
for
the
cars
ordered
and
the
charges
for
the
cars
furnished.
when
respondent
neither
complied
with
this
demand
nor
explained
the
failure
to
furnish
the
ordered
cars,
the
deduction
was
made
as
authorized
by
section
322
from
amount
subsequently
found
to
be
due
the
carrier.
in
this
case,
it
was
a
bill
which
the
carrier
had
rendered
in
connection
with
the
1950
transportation
services.
respondent
then
sued
to
recover
this
amount
which
had
been
deducted.
in
its
complaint,
however,
it
alleged
no
facts
at
all,
respecting
the
1944
shipments
upon
which
the
deduction
had
been
predicated.
instead,
the
complaint
simply
alleged
the
performance
of
the
1950
service
and
the
rendition
of
its
bill
therefore.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
approximately
six
years,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
period
--
that
period,
as
your
honor
will
recall,
of
course,
this
was
post
war
and
there
was
the
audit
of
the
bills
from
the
--
the
wartime
era.
we
have
some
statistics
in
our
brief.
and
i
think
this
court
in
the
western
pacific
case
last
year
refer
to
similar
statistics
with
respect
to
the
--
the
large
number
of
bills
that
the
general
accounting
office
would
require
to
audit
especially
in
this
--
this
period
that
followed
immediately
after
the
war.
i
am
told
now
that
--
advised
by
the
general
accounting
office
that
the
period
necessary
for
audit
has
been
substantially
reduced.
now,
the
--
i
have
indicated
the
complaint
alleged
nothing
with
respect
to
this
1944
shipments,
alleged
simply
the
performance
of
the
1950
shipments.
in
its
answer,
the
government
admitted
the
performance
of
the
1950
shipment
and
the
correctness
of
the
charges
for
that
shipment.
the
answer
went
on,
however,
to
plea
section
322
as
a
statutory
defense.
the
words
--
the
answer
pleaded
that
as
authorized
by
the
statute,
the
government
had
adjusted
the
1944
bills
by
deducting
from
the
amount
due
on
the
1950
bill.
it
explained
the
basis
of
the
determination
of
overpayment.
it
went
onto
alleged
that
the
respondent
had
never
supplied
for
the
government
with
any
facts
respecting
the
availability
of
the
cars
which
had
been
ordered.
the
respondent
there
filed
a
response
in
which
he
had
been
--
in
which
is
denied
that
it
had
overcharged
the
government
on
this
1944
shipments.
and
the
issue
was
thus
narrowed
to
the
correctness
of
the
charges
for
those
1944
shipments,
in
other
words,
to
the
merits
of
the
administrative
adjustment
which
the
government
had
made
pursuant
to
the
statute.
now,
both
of
the
courts
below
have
held
that
the
burden
of
establishing
the
essential
facts
on
this
issue,
the
facts
on
the
merits
of
the
government's
defense
based
upon
the
statute
rested
upon
the
united
states.
and
we
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
holding
is
an
error.
now,
we
think
that
fundamental
to
any
discussion
of
the
burden
approved
question
is
the
long
established
principle
that
a
claimant
against
the
government
has
the
burden
of
establishing
the
validity
of
its
claim.
now,
traditionally,
the
--
the
protection
of
the
public
treasury,
bills
submitted
in
connection
with
the
rendition
of
a
contractual
service
for
the
united
states
have
been
audited
prior
to
payment
under
rulings
of
the
comptroller
general
recognized
by
the
court
of
claims
as
far
back
as
the
1880s.
in
connection
with
this
pre-payment
examination,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
claimant
to
produce
evidence
satisfactory
establishing
that
claim.
if
it
doesn't
produce
that
evidence,
the
evidence
leaves
some
doubt
as
to
the
validity
of
the
claim.
the
claim
is
not
paid
and
the
claim
is
recourse
as
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act.
the
court
of
claims
has
continually
held
in
such
a
suit
the
claimant's
burden
as
the
same
as
on
the
administrative
level.
it
must
alleged
and
proved
the
facts
establishing
clear
liability
in
the
part
of
united
states
for
the
amount
assertedly
due
to
the
claimant.
now,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
these
procedures
were
concededly
applicable
to
common
carriers
as
well
as
to
all
other
claimants.
the
carrier
was
paid
only
that
amount
which
the
preaudit
determined
it
was
entitled
to
it.
it
must
be
satisfied
with
the
results
of
the
preaudit.
it
could
bring
suit
under
the
tucker
act
and
in
that
suit,
it
would
have
the
obligation
of
demonstrating
that
its
bills
were
correct
and
that
the
comptroller
general's
determination
was
in
error.
so
we
say
that
the
issue
here
really
narrows
it
down
to
this,
and
that
is
whether
section
322,
by
substituting
a
post-audit
for
a
preaudit
procedure
was
intended
to
or
does
in
fact
operate
to
relieve
the
carrier
of
this
traditional
obligation,
which
today
is
concededly
applies
to
all
other
claimants
against
the
united
states.
now,
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
in
some
detail
the
background
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
322.
in
sum,
it
is
this.
if
the
section
is
--
was
designed
to
serve
a
single
purpose
of
enabling
common
carriers
to
obtain
prompt
payment
on
their
bills.
it
was
inserted
in
the
transportation
act
solely
because
of
the
insistence
of
industry
spokesman
that
the
delays
attendant
to
the
prepayment
audit
of
bills
was
--
gave
rise
to
economic
hardship.
there
wasn't
the
slightest
intimation
anywhere
that
the
government's
right
to
require
the
carrier
to
establish
a
doubtful
claim
would
be,
in
any
wise,
affected
by
the
conversion
from
the
preaudit
to
the
post-audit
procedure.
to
the
contrary,
it
appears
that
all
concerned
believed
that
the
public
treasury
would
be
fully
protected
by
the
right
of
deduction
that
was
expressly
placed
in
the
statute.
the
only
inference,
we
submit,
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
permits
is
that
the
carriers
were
to
receive
the
benefit
of
prompt
payment
but
that
the
government
was
to
retain
an
impaired
the
right
should
a
post-audit
indicate
to
the
comptroller
general
that
there
was
a
basis
for
doing
so,
to
put
these
carriers
to
their
approval.
now,
in
this
connection,
we
think
it
is
of
no
little
significance
that
the
association
of
american
railroads,
itself,
the
industry
spokesman
for
the
railroads,
in
seeking
executive
support
for
this
change
from
the
preaudit
to
the
post-audit
procedure
indicated
that
if
the
government
pay
bills
upon
presentation
without
examination
to
determine
whether
they
were
correct
and
should
they
subsequently
determine
that
there
had
been
an
overpayment,
the
carrier
would
refund
the
amount
of
the
--
administratively
determine
over
--
overpayment
reserving
the
right,
of
course,
to
bring
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
if
it
were
dissatisfied
with
the
comptroller
general's
determination.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
oh,
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor,
the
railroad
knows
when
the
deduction
is
made,
the
railroad
is
appraised
of
the
particular
bill
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
previous
bill
which
was
administratively
determined
to
have
contained
an
overpayment
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
and
which
is,
therefore,
the
subject
of
this
particular
deduction,
to
the
railroad
knows
precisely
why
the
deduction
has
been
made.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
railroad,
when
it
brings
suit
then
to
recover
the
amount
of
the
deduction
which
is
made
from
these
amounts
subsequently
found
to
be
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
but
that's
what
the
suit,
in
effect,
your
honor,
is
to
recover
the
--
the
deduction
which
was
made
because
of
the
administrative
adjustment
on
the
earlier
bill.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
to
--
well,
your
honor,
the
government,
in
this
case,
when
the
railroad
suit
on
its
original
--
on
this
1950
bill,
the
government
set
up
a
statutory
defense.
it
--
it
set
up
the
defense
that
on
this
bill,
it
exercises
the
right
which
it
concededly
has
under
the
statute
to
adjust
the
1944
bills
through
the
vehicle
of
this
1950
bill.
now,
this
is
the
defense,
we
submit.
it
is
not
a
counterclaim.
we
are
defending
on
a
basis
that
we
had
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
we
--
it's
--
it's
a
particular
right
which
is
conferred
upon
us
by
--
expressly
by
this
statute.
now,
our
position
is
that
at
that
point,
the
--
what
the
--
the
real
issue
here,
what
it
narrows
itself
down
to
is
whether
or
not
in
this
particular
instance,
the
comptroller
general
properly
or
improperly
exercised
this
right
which
the
statute
concededly
confers
upon
him.
that
is
the
--
the
issue.
and
i
--
we
submit
that
then
the
carrier
to
meet
our
defense
must
show
that
the
comptroller
general
improperly
deducted
these
amounts.
now,
the
result
below
--
below,
of
course,
relieves
the
--
the
common
carriers
once
and
for
all,
for
all
times,
of
ever
establishing
the
validity
of
these
claims
which
were
paid
upon
presentation
and
the
legislative
history
does
--
does
not,
of
course,
indicates
that
that
was
nothing
intend
of
congress.
furthermore,
if
congress
had
intended
that
the
carrier
could
come
in
--
ostensibly
on
the
second
bill
and
thereby
relieved
itself
once
and
for
all
of
any
obligation
to
prove
the
correctness
of
the
original
charges,
congress
would
not
have
inserted
this
deduction
provision
at
all.
the
congress
wanted
to
place
upon
the
government,
wanted
to
change
the
whole
system
and
place
upon
the
government
in
the
future,
insofar
as
common
carriers
are
concerned,
the
obligation
to
disprove
the
correctness
of
railroad
charges
it
wouldn't
have
provided
for
deduction.
all
that
it
need
to
do
was
say
that
the
carriers
to
be
paid
promptly.
and
then
if
the
government
was
dissatisfied
with
the
results
of
the
--
the
prompt
payment
that
the
government
on
the
audit
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
repayment,
the
government
then
could
affirmatively
bring
suit
under
section
1345
of
title
28.
and
we
think
that
not
only
the
legislative
history
but
indeed,
the
terms
of
statute
itself
set
up
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
carrier
cannot
hide
behind
the
--
the
subsequent
bill.
and
i
might
note
in
that
connection
that
congress
did
--
obviously
did
not
intend,
in
any
of
instances,
that
there
would
be
any
dispute
as
to
the
bill
which
served
as
the
basis
for
making
the
deduction
because
going
back
to
the
terms
of
322
once
more,
the
section
says
that
the
amount
may
be
deducted
from
any
amounts
subsequently
found
to
be
due
the
carrier.
so
in
none
of
these
instances
would
there
ever
be
any
dispute
with
respect
to
the
bill
that
--
that
served
as
the
basis
for
the
deduction.
and
we
submit
that
the
carrier
cannot,
consistently
with
the
statutory
scheme,
command
and
allege
this
or
ostensibly
bring
suit
upon
this
--
this
later
bill
and
then
sit
back
and
say
it
is
up
to
the
government
to
disprove
that
--
to
prove
that
our
earlier
bills
were
incorrect.
and
we
say
in
the
first
instance,
true
enough
they
can
do
it
as
they
did
here,
but
we
have
the
right
to
plea,
not
as
counterclaim
but
as
a
statutory
defense,
that
what
we
did
is
authorized
by
the
statute.
it
is
a
necessary
result
of
the
change
from
the
preaudit
to
the
post-audit
procedure.and
as
you
will
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
--
that
is
quite
true
but
the
--
that
the
congress
felt
it
necessary
here
to
reiterate
it
expressly
where
that
common
law
right,
of
course,
is
--
at
all
times
existed,
we
think,
emphasizes
the
congressional
view
that
this
was
going
--
was
to
be
in
the
nature
of
a
conditional
payment
that
the
railroads
were
to
get
all
of
the
money
on
their
bills
promptly.
and
in
most
instances,
of
course,
there's
no
challenge.
and
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
322,
we
--
we
submit,
does
this.
it
reflects
the
congressional
intent
that
while
the
carriers
are
to
be
paid
promptly
in
presentation
should
be
subsequently
that
the
comptroller
general,
on
the
post-audit,
determine
that
there
has
been
an
overpayment,
that
the
government
then
can
put
itself
into
the
position
--
the
status
quo
ante
and
put
itself
into
the
position
that
would
have
occupied
as
to
those
bills
as
to
which
there
are
some
questions.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
is
--
it
is
permitted
to
place
itself
into
the
same
position
as
to
those
bills
as
to
which
there
are
some
question.
of
course,
that's
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
the
bills
that
it
would
have
been
under
the
old
procedure
had
it
been
able
to
audit
the
bills
in
advance.
and
that
is
the
protection.
it's
a
very
sensible
protection
because
the
--
the
major
complaint
of
the
carriers
under
the
preexisting
procedure
was
after
all
they
render
millions
of
bills
and
most
of
those
bills
are
--
are
clearly
correct,
that
they
weren't
getting
paid
for
years
even
on
the
bills
as
to
which
there
would
be
no
dispute
because
of
this
preaudit.
under
this
procedure,
they
collect
an
old
bill.
as
to
most
of
them,
there
will
be
no
dispute.
as
to
those
bills
which
there
is
a
dispute,
then
they
have
to
restore
the
government
to
the
--
restore
the
status
quo
prior
to
payment
and
reserving,
of
course,
this
right.
and
that's
what
these
carriers
were
seeking
as
the
--
as
the
association
of
american
railroads'
position
indicates.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
we
--
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
we
did
not.
that
--
that
what
we
--
the
comptroller
general
has
authorized
and
this
court
recognized
last
year
in
the
western
pacific
case
to
make
a
unilateral
setoff
and
a
unilateral
basis.
we
defended
on
the
ground
that
we
have
done
exactly
what
the
statute
authorizes
to
do.
now,
as
--
as
far
back
as
the
grand
trunk
western
case,
this
court
indicated
that
before
making
deductions,
and
this
was
even
absent
the
--
the
special
considerations
which
are
present
because
of
322,
that
making
a
deduction
that
the
fiscal
officers
of
the
government
do
not
need
to
first
go
into
court
to
establish
that
their
deduction
is
correct.
they
are
entitled
to
do
it
unilaterally.
now,
the
government
did
that
unilaterally
here.
it
had
the
perfect
right
to
do
it.
now,
that
represents
this
issue
then.
and
what
the
--
what
the
respondent's
recovery
is
conditioned
upon
is
that
in
this
particular
instance,
the
comptroller
general
did
not
properly
exercise
that
right.
now,
we
would
again
like
to
--
to
stress
that
their
--
both
the
--
the
reservation
of
the
provision
for
deduction
and
we
think
also
the
legislative
history
itself
indicates
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
transfer
as
to
this
very
limited
special
class
of
all
the
claimants
against
the
government
to
transfer
the
burden
unto
the
government
to
disprove
their
claims.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
but
they
have
their
money
and
that's
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
as
to
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
as
--
all
right.
but
that's
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
--
that's
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
true.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
but
that
--
that
is
--
that's
a
fact.
but
in
overall
--
but,
we
submit
first
of
all,
of
course,
that
there
is,
as
they
would
know
from
experience,
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
bills
which
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
aren't
challenged.
and
on
overall
basis,
this
does
not
require
the
railroads
to
keep
large
sums
of
money
in
reserve.
but
the
fact
is
that
this
is
a
consequence
which
stems
from
this
special
privilege
which
has
been
extended
to
this
one
class
of
claimants
as
against
all
other
classes.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
there
are
--
that
--
that
is
correct.
this
is
a
test
case
of
--
there
are
40
some
odd
other
cases
similarly
involved
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
this
is
--
this
is,
indeed,
a
--
a
test
case.
now,
the
--
the
effect
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
effect
of
the
court
--
of
the
holding
below
is
to
place
the
--
the
government
now
in
the
position
of
having
to
undertake
the
investigation
of
all
carrier
claims
which
are
presented
against
it
that
the
burden
is
now
shifted
to
the
government
affirmatively
to
disprove
all
of
the
representations
which
the
carriers
make
in
connection
with
their
own
bills.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
we
--
we
submit
that
is
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
in
terms
of
anyone
railroad,
it
is
not
a
large
burden.
in
the
statistics
which
were
set
forth
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
footnote
19
on
page
25,
indicate
that
in
one
particular
year
which
was
selected,
there
were
over
600,000
vouchers
audited
and
which
resulted
in
25,000
--
with
almost
26,000
notices
of
overpayment.
now,
in
terms
of
any
individual
carrier,
and
there
are
large
numbers
in
the
united
states,
that
is
not
too
significant.
in
terms
of
place
in
the
--
the
obligation
on
the
government,
and
every
one
of
those
vouchers
carries
--
not
paid
them
for
presentation,
every
one
of
those
vouchers,
the
government
now
under
the
holdings
below
would
be
obligated
to
go
out
and
affirmatively
disprove.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
there's
--
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be
an
increase
burden.
the
extent
to
which
it
would
be
increased
would
depend
impart
upon
how
many
of
the
particular
disputes
resolved
were
--
were
involved
rather
questions
of
fact
and
also,
i
suppose,
upon
the
degree
to
which
the
railroads
will
cooperate.
but
the
fact
is
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
precisely,
mr.
justice
brennan,
our
position.
that
--
and
we
think
that
again
that
the
legislative
history
in
background
of
the
statute,
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
--
that
would
be
solved.
of
course,
in
this
case
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
there
was
--
there's
no
breakdown
on
--
as
to
how
what
percentage
of
these
overpayments
involved
questions
of
fact.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
presently
pending,
what
percentage
their
represent,
i
do
not
know,
which
involved
this
question
of
the
availability
of
cars.
as
to
--
as
to
those
cases,
of
course,
this
question
is
--
is
foremost.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
absolutely
not,
that
as
this
statute
has
been
consistently
interpreted
by
the
general
accounting
office,
it
imposes
a
mandatory
duty
upon
the
fiscal
offices
of
the
government
to
pay
those
bills
as
long
as,
upon
presentation,
as
long
as
on
the
face.
there's
--
there's
no
objection
to
them.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
commenting
upon
which
mr.
sweeney
finished
up
with.
of
course
the
government
has
never
suggested
that
there
is
any
finality
attendant
to
the
post-audit
results
any
more
than
there
was
any
finality
attaching
to
the
administrative
determination
under
the
pre-audit
procedure.
the
government's
position
is
simply
that
where
this
--
the
post-audit
which
have
been
substituted
for
the
pre-audit,
where
in
that
post-audit
the
administrative
officials
responsible
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
bills
of
the
carrier,
the
carrier
is
then
under
an
obligation
to
establish
the
correctness
of
those
bills
and
if
it
does
not
do
it
on
an
administrative
level,
it
has
to
do
it
in
a
judicial
level.
now,
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
go
into
a
minute
to
the
administrative
practice
here.
when
as
mr.
sweeney
indicated
after
the
--
the
audit
is
conducted,
if
the
general
accounting
office
has
a
question
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
bill,
they
send
out
this
form
1003.
the
carrier
upon
receive
of
that
form
enters
into
or
has
the
--
certainly,
the
ability
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
the
general
accounting
office.
if
it's
got
evidence
satisfactory
establishing
the
validity
of
their
claim,
it
has
the
opportunity
to
present
that
evidence.
it's
the
same
thing
as
under
the
pre-audit
procedure.
if
under
the
pre-audit,
the
question
had
risen,
the
carrier
was
advised
and
it
could
then
present
its
proof.
the
question
here
is
whether
carrier
does
not
establish
its
claim.
who
has
then
in
the
subsequent
judicial
proceeding
the
burden?
and
of
course,
the
carrier
is
not
required
in
a
judicial
proceeding
of
this
kind
to
show
that
on
any
overall
basis
it
is
not
indebted
to
the
government.
the
carrier
knows
from
its
negotiation
for
the
gao
just
precisely
what
bills
were
issued
and
just
precisely
what
the
nature
of
that
issue
is.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
the
1950
bill
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
the
1950
bill
never
could
have
been
an
issue
because
congress
in
setting
up
the
statutory
scheme
said
that
you
will
deduct
from
amounts
found
to
be
due
to
carriers.
so,
when
mr.
sweeney
suggest
that
the
railroad
is
willing
to
assume
its
burden,
he
is
saying
that
the
railroad
is
willing
to
assume
its
burden
of
proving
the
correctness
of
a
bill
which
he
already
knows
the
government
has
not
and
will
not
challenge.
and
that
actual
--
in
actuality,
we
think
this
has
to
be
governed
by
the
statutory
scheme.
now,
the
private
shipper
interestingly
enough,
he
can't
make
these
deductions
from
subsequent
bills.
he's
in
the
position
where
he
has
to
bring
the
affirmative
proceeding.
that
congress
could
have
done
that
with
the
government.
congress
could
have
said,
“you
were
paid
properly.
and
if
subsequently
you
think
you've
been
overcharged,
you
can
bring
a
suit
and
recover
just
the
way
a
private
shipper
has.”
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
he's
got
very
brief
credit
and
i
don't
know
whether
he
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
--
i'm
not
so
certain
if
he
could
withhold
at
the
end
of
the
credit
period
of
96
hours.
i
think
he
would
be
required
to
pay
the
amount
of
the
bills.
i
think
the
icc
doesn't
say
that
you
can
withhold
payment
for
96
hours
and
then
not
pay
at
all
if
you
don't
think
that
it
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes.
and
if
he
does
that,
the
carrier
sues
them
and
the
railroad
then
it
has
the
burden
of
proof.
see,
we're
the
ones
that
are
in
the
position
of
having
--
we
don't
have
--
we
have
to
pay
these
bills.
we
don't
have
the
option
of
the
pre-audit
at
all.
and
again
of
course
that
the
government
was
not
intended
to
be
placed
in
the
same
position
as
the
private
shipper
as
reflected
by
the
deduction
provision.
and
of
course
congress
has
set
up,
we
have
had
them
in
our
brief,
numerous
statutory
protections
to
make
certain
that
improper
claims
are
not
presented
to
the
treasury
and
that
the
public
treasury
is
not
rated
thereby.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
the
--
the
government's
position
is
this
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
under
rule
34,
as
--
means
this,
that
the
carrier
can
charge
the
government
or
any
other
shipper
on
the
basis
of
the
larger
cars
furnished
if,
but
only
if
that
carrier
did
not
have
the
smaller
car
--
smaller
cars
which
were
ordered
available.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
well,
the
furnishing,
we
submit
places
the
burden
upon
the
carrier
to
come
in
and
show
that
we
did
not
supply
you
what
you
ordered
and
what
was
necessary
because
we
didn't
have
it
available.
now,
we
don't
think
that
that's
any
extraordinary
burden
at
all.
and
of
course,
the
government
transportation
officers
are
in
no
position
to
know
what
the
para
market
railroad
happen
to
have
at
this
time.
that
is
information
which
is
in
the
railroad's
possession.
they've
got
the
cars,
we
don't.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
but
--
if
at
prima
facie,
we
submit
and
there
was
no
indication
in
this
record
at
all
that
the
--
that
the
government
here
was
in
possession.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
would
have
been
under
possession
of
any
in
this
information.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
