what
was
the
time
element
between
the
original
shipment
which
is
claimed
the
government
has
been
overcharged
done
and
the
general
accounting
office
audit
any
deduction
to
the
subsequent
bill?
justice
john
m.
harlan
six
years?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
--
does
that
mean,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
your
view
that
there's
a
322
deduction
on
bill
a,
along
comes
the
railroad
and
three
years
later,
choose
on
bill
b,
you
say
that
the
railroad
has
to
allege
as
part
of
its
cause
of
action
on
bill
b
that
there
are
no
valid
offsets
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
against
those
charges?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i'm
talking
about
to
recover
the
amount
of
a
new
bill
not
the
deduction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
yes,
but
it's
the
consequence
of
that
when
it
wants
to
recover
on
a
new
bill
as
to
which
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
deduction
that
it
also
has
to
alleged
and
prove
that
there
are
no
amounts
owning
by
it
to
the
government
or
offsets
with
the
government
had
claimed
in
respect
to
prior
bills.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that's
a
conventional
offset.
justice
john
m.
harlan
judge
magruder
points
out
you'd
had
that
right
to
deduct
the
part
of
statute
as
a
right
to
common
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
your
premise,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government's
situation,
what
have
you
to
say
to
the
argument
is
the
burden
shifts
or
at
least
the
duty
of
going
to
forward
shifts,
once
the
government
has
shown
that
--
once
the
government
has
alleged,
which
in
here
that
there
were
cars
available,
that
the
burden
shifts
to
you
because
the
records
necessary
to
prove
this
are
all
in
your
possession.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
is
why
conventional
--
conventional
greeting,
i
suppose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps,
the
other
one
could
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
not
same
result.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
this
is
summary
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
summary
judgment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
said
there
were
cars
available
prepared
to
(inaudible)
that.
and
you
fellows
do
nothing
more
under
those
circumstances
in
assuming
that
this
is
an
exception
to
the
burden
of
proof
rule
or
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden,
why
wouldn't
the
government
be
entitled?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
assuming
that
the
burden
is
on
you,
either
originally
or
the
result
of
shifting,
in
the
consequence
and
any
of
those
affected
at
all
by
the
lapse
of
time
between
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
want
to
get
at.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
it
show
on
this
record
--
the
facts
shown
in
this
record
that
your
record
has
been
destroyed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
really,
what
you're
doing
here
is
saying
that
although
the
railroad
sued
on
the
1950
bill,
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
the
1944
situation
and
therefore,
the
burden
is
on
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
