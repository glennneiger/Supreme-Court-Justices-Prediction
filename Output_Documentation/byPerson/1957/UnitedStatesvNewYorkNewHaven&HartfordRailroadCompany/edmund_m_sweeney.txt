mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice,
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
started
off,
it
was
on
a
very
elemental
claim.
we
thought
that
we
were
suing
on
a
simple
contract
to
collect
transportation
charges
for
services
that
we
rendered
in
1950.
at
the
outset,
the
government
filed
what
--
what
really
purported
to
be
a
general
denial
of
the
charges
in
1950.
subsequently,
however,
they
filed
a
substitute
answer.
and
then,
in
that
answer,
they
said,
"all
right.
we
admit.
you
did
perform
those
charges
--
those
services.
those
charges
were
proper.
and
you
are
due
those
charges.
however,
we
have
paid
you,
they
said.
"we
paid
you
a
check
of
$117
and
some
odd,
and
then
we
have
taken
out
over
$1000
which
is
our
right
under
322,
section
322
of
the
transportation
act
because
six
years
prior
in
1944,
you
furnished
cars
that
were
longer
than
the
size
of
cars
ordered."
and
we
say
--
we
have
determined
that
there
were
cars
available
of
the
right
size.
so
therefore,
we
claimed
a
credit
for
the
difference.
now,
that
point,
of
course,
the
elemental
part
of
the
case
began
to
back
down
because
as
the
right
way,
the
government
then
said
to
the
district
court,
"the
railroad
cannot,
in
anyway,
claim
relief
here
because
they
have
not
alleged
the
facts
which
would
show
that
our
claim
as
to
the
1944
situation
was
true."
and
the
railroad
rebelled.
that
railroad
said,
"we
do
not
have
to
allege
in
any
suit
for
a
1950
charge
that
we
did
not
--
we're
not
overpaid
in
1944."
the
thing
hinged
--
the
--
the
case
hinged
on
that
point
and
the
government
refused
to
go
forward
any
proof
and
so
the
claim
is
filed
for
summary
judgment,
would
grant
a
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
factual
issue
outstanding
as
to
the
1950
charges.
and
that
as
to
the
allegations
in
regard
to
1944,
they
were
a
--
an
affirmative
defense.
they
were
a
set
off
by
way
of
counterclaim
and
that
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof,
so
held
the
district
court
and
so
held
the
first
circuit
on
appeal.
now,
the
government's
position
is
based
solely
upon
the
fact
that
all
of
these
new
rights
in
judicial
procedure
come
to
the
government
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
322,
section
322
of
the
transportation
act.
and
we
say,
and
our
position
here
today
is,
that
it
is
neither
just
nor
reasonable
nor,
in
any
way,
necessary
to
attribute
those
particular
properties
through
section
322
and
that
those
provisions
are
not
nor
can
they
be
read
into
section
322.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
if
the
government
was
overcharged
and
it
can
proved
in
it
set
off
that
we
have
the
cars
available
in
1944,
then
they
--
their
setoff
would
be
allowed
against
our
charges
of
1950.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
it
was
not
the
case,
your
honor,
because
it
would
never
arise.
you
see
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
that
is
correct.
there
are
two
points
i'd
like
to
bring
out
here
though.
first
of
all,
it
was
an
unfair
advantage
to
be
given
to
the
government
as
a
shipper
because
once
the
government
was
in
commerce,
they
should
be
just
like
any
other
shipper.
and
the
--
and
the
rule
provided
that
the
other
shipper
had
to
pay
us
upon
delivery.
actually,
i
honestly
believe
that
a
railroad,
at
any
time,
could
just
stop
serving
the
government
until
they
were
paid
like
any
other
shipper,
but,
of
course,
naturally,
they
wouldn't.
now,
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
on
that
is
this.
that
the
government
has
placed
great
reliance
upon
what
now
has
become
to
be
a
tenant
of
this,
tenant
of
this,
and
that
is
this.
that
it
is
traditional
that
everybody
that
has
a
claim
against
the
government
must
prove
it.
well,
now,
we
believe
that,
and
we
could
have
sued
on
the
deduction
itself.
and
if
we
had
sued
on
the
deduction,
we
would
have
to
prove
whether
or
not
we
have
the
cars
available.
but
i
say
that
322,
in
no
way,
permits
me
or
prohibits
me
from
choosing
the
forum
in
which
i
wish
to
go
in.
and
i
also
say
that
it
does
not,
in
any
way
change,
the
judicial
rules
which
allows
the
plaintiff
to
frame
the
issue.
now,
the
government
is
trying
to
claim
here
that
322
changes
all
the
--
the
fundamentals
of
practice
and
procedure
in
that
whenever
the
government
appears
as
a
counter
claimant
against
the
railroad
that
all
rules
are
on,
new
rules
are
on
that
the
railroad
then
has
to
disprove
the
government's
case.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
certainly
would
not
be.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
continuing
in
the
line
of
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan.
i'd
like
to
say
that
our
position
is
that
there
was
no
real
significant
change
in
the
responsibilities
before
or
of
after
322.
but
that
i
mean
this,
it
is
true
that
before
322
the
government
could
take
its
good
time
about
determining
whether
it
owed
the
money.
but
my
point
and
our
point
here
is
that
that
was
not
a
final
determination.
if
the
carrier
did
not
like
that,
the
carrier
could
go
into
court
and
some
judicial
tribunal
will
determine
whether
or
not
that
was
a
proper
payment
by
the
government.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
railroad.
and
after
322,
the
railroads
could
go
in
and
sue
on
the
amount
deducted
that
is,
they
could've
gone
in
and
sued
on
this
$1025.
and
if
they
have
then
it
would
have
been
up
to
the
railroads
to
prove
their
case.
we
are
not
saying
in
any
way
that
the
railroad
should
be
relieved
from
the
burden
of
proving
their
case.
we
are
simply
saying
that
when
the
railroad
sues
for
one
bill
and
the
government
convened
by
way
of
affirmative
defense
at
its
set
off.
we
are
saying
that
the
railroad
does
not
have
the
burden
of
disproving
the
government's
case.
and
conversely,
the
government
does
have
the
real
burden
of
proving
that
its
counterclaim
in
set
off
is
valid.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
mr.
justice,
no.
we
--
we
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
we
would
and
we
would
do
that
just
as
a
matter
of
--
of
practical
mechanics
of
a
--
of
a
suit.
first
of
all
mr.
justice,
may
i
explain
that
--
i
don't
know
how
to
explain
it
because
i
know,
you
know
more
about
than
i
do,
but
there's
nothing
mystical
about
a
322
transaction
between
the
government
and
the
railroads.
they
do
not
at
all
act
at
arm's
length.
first
of
all,
the
railroad
and
the
government
both
employed
very
experienced,
highly
trained
personnel
in
rates
and
divisions
classification.
and
when
the
government
says
that
they
have
overpaid
the
railroad,
the
railroad
looked
it
over
and
there
is
a
--
an
amicable
interchange
of
their
opinion.
and
i
would
say
that
possibly
at
least
95%
of
the
cases
where
there
is
a
deduction
under
322,
there
is
an
amicable
adjustment.
now,
actually
in
the
case
here
before
us
today,
that
--
that
very
so
--
same
thing
happened.
they
deducted
$1025.
after
looking
the
thing
over,
the
railroad
agreed
that
all
but
$402,
it
was
a
proper
deduction.
likewise,
the
government
agreed,
too,
that
in
part
of
it
that
service
order
68
did
not
apply.
so
you
see,
it's
one
of
those
things
where
they
--
it's
a
workable
rule
and
they
tried
to
work
out
the
best
they
can.
however,
we
say
that
it
is
not
fair
or
just
unreasonable
to
impute
to
section
322
the
right
in
the
government
when
they
have
come
to
a
stalemate
with
the
railroad,
the
right
in
the
government
to
say,
“well,
i
listened
to
you.
you're
a
nice
fellow,
but
this
is
it.
we're
going
to
make
the
determination
and
we
say
this.
you
either
pay
us
back
or
else."
and
the
“or
else”
is
the
deduction.
we
say
that
in
lieu
of
some
--
there
is
no
means
of
--
for
arbitrating
these
stalemates.
and
we
say
that
the
only
proper
tribunal
is
the
one
that's
left
which
is
the
judicial
tribunal.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
first
of
all,
mr.
justice,
i
recognize
the
fact
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
could
shift
and
possibly
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
the
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
the
--
the
burden
could
shift
if
it
could
be
shown
that
there
were
facts
which
were
peculiarly
within
the
knowledge
of
the
railroad.
now,
actually
as
--
well,
as
the
case
finally
developed
for
the
government
now,
they
are
saying
that
they
did,
that
they
did
present
a
prima
facie
case.
and
they
are
saying
that
once
they
simply
alleged
that
the
size
of
the
car
or
that
was
available
that
that
is
sufficient.
and
then
the
burden
of
going
forward
shifted
to
us.
now,
i
say
this,
if
they
had
put
in
one
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
there
were
cars
of
the
size
available,
this
--
or
the
cars
of
the
size
ordered
available
then
at
least
that
would
have
been
some
indication
that
they
were
prepared
to
assume
the
burden
of
proving
that
counterclaim
and
it
would
have
been
up
to
the
court
to
determine
within
whose
province
lay
the
peculiarity
of
these
facts.
now,
in
meeting
the
government's
argument
in
the
railroad's
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
actually
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
in
this
case,
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
could
successfully
allege
that
the
facts
were
peculiarly
within
the
knowledge
of
the
railroad,
because
first
of
all,
the
government
who
ought
to
found
the
relief
was
very
unhappy
with
the
service
order
68,
so
unhappy
that
shortly
after
it
was
inaugurated
by
the
icc,
they
petitioned
to
have
it
waived
insofar
it
applied
running
government
shipments.
and
in
that
particular
petition
which
by
the
way
it's
set
out
as
exhibit
a
in
the
railroad's
brief.
in
that
petition
the
war
department
went
to
great
lengths
to
show
what
they
were
doing
to
see
to
it
that
all
facets
of
the
transportation
facilities
were
being
used.
and
they
pointed
out
that
they
had
made
spot
inspections
and
they
have
this
and
they
have
that.
it's
quite
amply,
i
submit,
setting
forth
that
the
government
knew
just
as
much
about
or
whether
we
had
cars
available
or
not,
but
to
get
back
your
honor's
question,
if
that
had
--
if
it
is
true
that
had
the
case
progressed
to
the
point
where
the
government
was
assuming
its
burden
of
proof,
they
might
well
have
come
a
place
in
the
case
where
the
burden
of
going
forward
might
have
shifted.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
your
honor
please,
first
of
all,
the
--
it
isn't
--
wasn't
quite
that
way.
it
is
true
that
it
was
summary
judgment,
but
it
was
summary
judgment
filed
by
the
plaintiff.
the
--
the
motion
filed
by
the
government
was
a
motion
i
didn't
quite
understand.
it
was
a
motion
which
said,
“we
seek
judgment
for
the
government
because
the
plaintiff,”
being
the
railroad,
“has
not
alleged
facts
which
entitled
it
to
relief.”
now,
the
district
court
denied
that
motion
and
at
the
same
time
the
railroad
had
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
claiming
that
there
was
no
general
issue
of
facts
outstanding.
and
since
we
do
not
believe
that
the
facts
of
--
whether
we
knew
or
they
knew
more
about
the
availability
of
the
cars,
that
wasn't
alleged
to
the
facts
so
the
court
naturally
assume
that
--
i
mean,
they
decided
on
the
facts
that
there
was
no
fact
outstanding.
so
that
it
was
--
there
are
--
arose
in
this
case.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
that
i
ever
got
the
actual
facts
of
that.
my
recollection
of
the
record,
of
the
file
in
the
case
is
that
the
government
sent
out
what
they
call
a
form
103
and
that
form
says
on
it
or
contains
on
it
the
--
the
new
computation
procedure
according
to
the
determination
of
the
government.
and
i
think
it
simply
said
that
service
order
68
did
not
apply,
something
to
that
effect.
i
do
know
that
--
that
i
--
the
cars
to
be
served
upon
them
extensive
interrogatory,
trying
to
find
out
some
of
the
answers
myself
and
i
do
know
that
in
answer
to
some
of
my
interrogatories,
they
had
said
that
they
didn't
think
the
service
order
applied,
service
order
68
applied
in
this
case.
now,
likewise,
speaking
of
those
interrogatories,
the
only
facts
upon
which
the
government
relied
by
the
way,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
only
fact
upon
which
the
government
relies,
that
it
has
proof,
the
question
of
availability
to
the
cars
was
there
own
answers
to
interrogatories.
and
--
and
i
say
that's
no
proof
at
all.
i
mean,
that's
just
a
statement
in
which
the
court
either
could
have
or
did
not
have
to
believe.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
several
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
one
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
one
of
the
big
controversies
is
land
grant,
of
course,
out
the
war
situation.
that's
land
grant
whether
--
whether
the
government
paid
for
transportation
over
--
over
an
area
that
was
land
granted,
that's
one
of
them.
then
classifications
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
that's
right.
it's
a
question
of
fact,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
as
to
whether
any
particular
mileage
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
--
of
railroad
was
land
granted.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
and
that
were
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
now,
another
type
would
be
--
well,
such
as
they
had
in
the
western
pacific
case,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
incendiary
bomb
was
an
incendiary
bomb.
in
other
words,
whether
a
shallow
case
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
classification
--
classification
problem
would
be
another
one.
well,
rates
and
division
such
as
we
have
in
--
sometimes,
when
we
have
these
explosives
sent
from
the
west
coast
to
boston
for
example
and
they
had
to
be
backed
up
during
the
war.
they
were
--
they
had
what
they
call
backup
deck
all
the
way
from
a
large
metropolitan
area.
and
the
question
is
to
whether
there
were
rates
and
divisions
involved
in
that
as
to
whether
the
government
through
a
section
20
--
quotation
22
rate
paid
the
proper
amount,
those
are
the
examples
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
it
could
be.
it
--

well,
i
think
they
do,
your
honor,
because
every
time
that
we
go
to
the
gao,
we
meet
the
same
nice
gentlemen
that
are
there
and
they
--
i
think
they
--
they're
experts.

i
think

think

office

is
generally
nice.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
certainly,
but
my
contact
has
been
with
that
particular
group.
section
--
the
--
the
history
of
322
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
because,
your
honor,
the
--
the
transportation
during
the
war
as
you
know
was
conducted
by
the
transportation
corps
and
they
had
a
man
assigned
to
each
area
and
those
were
the
persons
who
ordered
the
cars.
now,
at
any
time
--
at
any
time
that
the
--
first
of
all,
these
cars
were
not
loaded
by
the
railroad,
they
were
given
over
to
a
government
train.
they
have
a
depot
of
some
sort
where
they
were
being
loaded.
now,
at
any
time
that
the
cars
came
in
there,
they
did
not
necessarily
come
in,
in
the
one,
two,
three
order
that
they
were
ordered
on
the
bill
of
lading,
say
of
yesterday,
because
that
would
have
been
almost
impossible.
so,
if
they
ordered
10
cars,
the
10
cars
were
shifted
over
to
them
as
they
came
in
and
the
government
had
its
own
selection
of
the
number
of
cars
that
come
in
to
its
own
depot
as
to
which
one
they'd
use
first
or
which
one
they'd
use
second.
now,
if
at
anytime
the
safety
army
for
example,
if
the
army
had
received
the
cars
in
response
to
its
orders,
which
cars
were
not
in
the
size
ordered,
they
could
have
refused
to
accept
those
cars
and
made
the
railroad
determine
whether
or
not
they
had
them.
we
--
i
--
i
think
it
is
only
reasonable
to
keep
in
mind
in
this
context
that
the
furnishing
of
government
or
cars
to
the
government
during
the
war
was
a
tremendous
problem.
and
thus,
it
was
one
of
those
things
where
i
think
everybody
just
did
the
best
they
could
to
get
along
the
best
they
could
and
it
was
only
some
six
years
afterwards,
the
two
examiners
in
the
gao
office
determined
that
we
didn't
have
these
cars.
as
i
read
the
rule
34,
now
rule
34
is
in
the
--
it's
ordered
in
classification
number
14
and
that
is
the
one
that
has
the
rule
in
it
that
says
that
if
the
government
is
unable
to
furnish
a
car
of
the
size
ordered,
then
it
must
charge
only
--
that
it
must
charge
with
the
size
of
the
car
furnished
if
the
goods
which
are
to
be
transported
will
not
fit
on
the
size
of
the
car
ordered.
now,
that
was
a
good
rule.
now,
service
order
68
which
is
the
basis
of
this
case
waived
that
rule.
and
the
result
of
service
order
68
was
this,
that
if
the
government
was
unable
--
if
the
railroad
is
unable
to
furnish
the
government
with
a
car
of
the
size
ordered
then
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
the
goods
to
be
shipped
could
be
shipped
on
that
size
or
could
not
be
shipped
on
that
size
the
government
still
paid
for
the
size
of
the
car
furnished.
and
i
think
it's
real
to
point
out
here
that
this
was
not
a
rule
put
in
by
the
railroad.
this
is
a
rule
put
in
by
the
icc.
and
in
the
petition
by
the
secretary
of
war
to
have
this
service
order
68
defended
as
to
the
government
which
is
appendix
a
in
our
brief.
it
is
--
it
is
pointed
out
there
that
this
was
not
to
--
this
is
not
something
which
the
railroad
had
done
and
that
it
was
something
that
the
icc
had
put
in
and
that
it
was
necessary
even
though
the
government
would
suffer
some
additional
payments
for
the
larger
size
ordered.
we
think
that
it's
--
i
--
i
sincerely
think
that
it
was
just
as
easy
for
all
the
--
and
under
those
circumstances,
just
as
easy
for
the
government
to
prove
the
availability
of
the
car
--
size
of
the
car
or
the
size
ordered
as
it
was
for
the
railroad.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
i
think
they
have
never
set
it
forth,
but
i
would
assume
that
the
only
one
that
they
had
made
was
this.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
no.
there
isn't
--
nothing.
you
see,
they
didn't
offer
anything
but
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
i
--
i'm
--
i
think
i
know
what
the
basis
was
and
that
is
that
in
the
bill
of
lading,
they
--
there
are
two
little
boxes,
one
entitled,
size
of
car
ordered
and
the
other
one,
size
of
car
furnished.
so
that
any
--
keep
in
mind,
this
was
six
years
after
they
were
furnished.
some
clerk
is
going
through
there
and
they
see
one
box
marked
40
feet
for
all
(inaudible)
and
they
see
the
next
box
marked
46
feet
for
six
(inaudible)
that's
enough
for
them.
in
other
words,
they
--
they
assumed
just
from
seeing
those
two
--
two
marks,
that
since
we
furnished
the
larger
one
that
we
had
the
other
one
available.
they
--
they're
using
the
converse
of
the
rule.
that's
all
that
--
that's
all
i
could
say
(inaudible)
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
you're
not
wrong
in
the
full
text.
you're
wrong
in
this,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
that
it
does
not
spell
out
that
if
the
railroad
says
it
does
not
have
the
car,
it
simply
says,
if
the
railroad
is
unable
to
furnish,
and
it
doesn't
say
that
the
railroad
has
to
state
that
they're
unable.
and
so,
i
would
assume
that
the
rule
of
regularity
would
apply
here
like
everything
else.
in
the
rule
of
regularity,
you
are
suppose
to
--
we
were
suppose
to
obey
those
rules
so
that
if
we
had
a
car
available,
we
would
give
it.
and
that
if
we
didn't
if
we
didn't
have
the
car
available
and
we
furnished
the
car
of
the
larger
size,
there
would
be
the
inference
or
the
presumption
that
we
didn't
have
the
car
of
the
size
ordered.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
yes.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
you
see,
we
--
we
destroy
our
records
at
the
end
of
three
years.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
and
we
do
that
by
permission
of
the
icc.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
because
if
we
wait
six
years,
we
don't
have
this
record
and
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
sir?
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
we
didn't
raise
it
as
a
defense,
sir,
because
they
never
offered
to
prove
our
counter
--
their
counterclaim
to
the
--
as
in
the
lower
court.
they
didn't
do
anything.
we
just
say
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
--
prove
their
case.
it
would
have
definitely
have
been
raised,
mr.
justice
whittaker
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
i
think
it
shows,
mr.
justice,
in
the
record
but
not
through
our
case.
it
shows,
mr.--
in
mr.
justice
mcgruder's
opinion.
he
recites
atlantic
coast
line
case
and
he
adopts
certain
language
there
and
i'm
pretty
sure
that
the
--
i
do
know
that
he
did
adopt
the
language
from
the
atlantic
coast
line
case
in
which
it
said
that
the
court
was
satisfied
that
the
records
were
destroyed.
the
railroad
--
all
railroad
records
were
destroyed
at
the
end
of
three
years.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
that's
right.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
it
is
--
it's
an
order
of
the
icc
and
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
is
a
mandatory
order
that
you
do
it.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
it
is
a
permissive
order.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
as
my
understanding
that
it
is.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
in
other
words,
we
cannot
--
we
cannot
destroy
without
their
permission,
but
i
will
check
it
up
if
it's
a
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
well,
no.
of
course,
it's
not
a
fair
gap.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
but
the
--
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
that's
--
that's
right,
it
should,
your
honor.
we
--
we
of
course
are
in
this
position,
the
icc,
as
also
the
government
and
i
assume
that
they
would
want
to
protect
us
as
well
protect
the
government
in
that
respect.
mr.
edmund
m.
sweeney
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
in
the
moment
of
thought
that
i
have
left,
we
respectfully
raise
that
it's
not
reasonable
to
say
that
322
allows
the
government
to
make
a
final
determination
and
that
where
the
government
brings
their
deduction
under
322
into
a
judicial
proceeding,
they
must
meet
the
requirements
of
any
other
counterclaimant
and
therefore
they
must
prove
their
case.
