chief

who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.--
mr.
sweeney,
before
you
get
to
the
history,
would
you
answer
me
this
please.
do
i
--
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
the
tariff
for
this
commodity
that
was
being
transported
would
have
been
lower,
the
math
which
the
railroad
charged,
if
the
railroad
had
had
the
proper
size
cars
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
if
they
didn't
have
the
cars
for
it
and
had
to
--
had
to
use
a
larger
one,
but
then
the
government
would
have
to
--
have
to
pay
the
tariff
for
the
larger
car.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
--
what
i
want
to
ask
is
this.
how
could
the
government
be
expected
to
know
and
to
prove
that
your
railroad
didn't
have
cars
on
that
particular
day
of
the
particular
size
that
were
called
for,
for
the
lower
tariff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
the
rule
said
that
they
--
they
were
to
get
the
lower
rate
unless
the
railroad
could
establish
that
it
didn't
have
that
kind
of
cars
and
only
had
the
larger
ones.
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it's
all
right.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenthal.
