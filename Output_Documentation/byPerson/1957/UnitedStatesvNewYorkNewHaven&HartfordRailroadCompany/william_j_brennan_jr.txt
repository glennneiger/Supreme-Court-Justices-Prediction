justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
rosenthal,
i
gather
in
essence
that
your
argument
comes
down
to
this,
that
before
322,
whenever
an
issue
of
overcharge
arose,
the
burden
was
upon
the
railroads
to
sustain
its
complaint.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
all
the
322
did,
adapted
for
the
convenience
of
the
carriers
so
that
they'd
get
their
money
little
earlier
than
otherwise
they
did,
made
no
change
in
the
instance
where
issues
of
overcharge,
the
road
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
still
had
the
burden
upon
the
carrier
to
establish
the
claims.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
when
issues
of
overcharge
arise,
i
suppose
most
of
them
are
resolved
by
negotiation
between
the
carrier
and
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
these
things
arise
only
when
the
issue
persists
and
hasn't
been
resolved
between
the
party?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
will
that
run
anything
like
25,000
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
sweeney,
how
--
how
--
assuming
you're
right,
how
does
the
government
get
its
money
back
if
it
was
overcharged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they'd
have
to
go
out
and
affirmatively
prove
then
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fact
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
upon
which
they
based
the
allegation
of
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
didn't
--
which
was
not
the
case
before
322.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
before
322,
as
i
understand
it,
the
practice
was
if
you
submitted
a
bill
that
was
pre-audited
and
the
government
said,
"you've
overcharged
this
by
$1100,"
then
it'd
be
the
railroad's
burden
to
establish
in
court
that
in
fact,
there
was
no
overcharge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
sweeney,
when
this
claim
was
processed,
the
deduction
initially
arise
that
by
the
government
after
they
ordered
on
the
post-audit.
did
the
government
say,
we're
entitled
of
this
deduction
because
the
railroad
hasn't
proved
to
us
they
didn't
have
cars
available
or
was
the
audit
in
its
position,
we
know
the
fact
that
the
railroad
did
have
cars
available.
