justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this.
suppose
it
--
just
to
find
out
exactly
what
is
here.
suppose
these
were
not
--
you
didn't
have
this
particular
situation.
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
he
should
be
acquitted
--
held
that
he
should
be
acquitted
because
his
testimony
showed
he
was
honest.
he
was
satisfied.
he
didn't
have
enough
conviction.
and
the
government
would
have
come
in
and
say,
“well,
before
that's
done,
before
you
pass
on,
we
pass
on,
before
you
pass
on
the
point
that
the
record
show,
we
have
a
great
deal
of
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
perjurer
and
a
liar
and
we
therefore
want
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
before
it
passes
on
the
--
this
record
to
make
him
with
this
conviction,
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
new
evidence
we
have
that
he's
a
perjurer
and
a
liar
is
correct.
could
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
the
whole
record,
you
--
suppose
you
are
compelled
to
admit
and
the
court
decided
that
on
the
record
as
the
case
was
tried,
the
--
the
defendant
was
entitled,
have
the
case
vacated
and
dismissed.
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
of
no
additional
evidence.
your
argument
was
that
shouldn't
be
done
because
you
knew
now
you
could
get
more
evidence
that
he
--
that
he
referred
to
use
that
and
you
could
show
that
to
the
court.
could
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i'll
express
myself
there
fully
on
that
in
a
civil
case
and
a
patent
case
where
we
held
and
i
wrote
the
opinion
that
there
was
an
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
set
aside
judgments
obtained
by
fraud
on
the
court.
the
reason
i'm
asking
you
this
is
because
according
to
the
facts,
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
why
it's
confronted.
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
say
that
it
happens
a
lot.
what
--
this
being
a
criminal
case,
i
suppose,
the
court
was
right
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
convict
the
court
of
appeals.
it
comes
up
to
us
and
the
government
said
“well,
we
have
additional
evidence
and
it's
not
in
the
record
which
shows
this
defendant
was
a
perjurer.”
and
without
regard
whether
the
record
now
entitled
him
to
reverse
it,
we
want
the
case
remanded
to
have
the
district
court
decide
this
new
evidence
as
to
his
perjury.
would
that
be
similar
to
this
or
what
would
be
the
distinction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
acquittal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
they
--
they
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
that
we
have
--
with
that
regard
--
don't
look
at
this
record
--
to
say
immaterial
to
look
at
this
record,
we
will
assume
if
we
have
to
assume
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
of
saying
if
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
on
the
basis
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
you
--
then
your
distinction
is
if
you
draw
it.
i
assume
that
this
was
on
a
preliminary
motion
in
regard
to
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
no
double
jeopardy
there
with
reference
to
the
government.
i
doubt
if
the
measure
of
the
case,
if
the
other
case
by
the
defendant
were
granted
this
privilege
could
be
held
as
authority
for
our
action
here.
now,
maybe
there's
something
else
can
but
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
focus
your
attention
on.
let's
suppose
that
we
looked
over
this
record,
we
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
just
wasn't
enough
to
convict
him.
and
the
--
the
government
said,
“well,
even
though
there
wasn't
enough
to
convict
him,
i
don't
want
you
to
order
the
case
dismissed
because
we
have
more
evidence
here.”
it
seems
to
me
that's
about
the
question
you
have
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
hasn't
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
under
my
--
under
my
set
of
assumptions,
it
couldn't
prevail
here
on
the
record
as
it
now
is.
let's
assume
that
the
record
as
it
now
is
to
be
examined
by
this
court
and
we
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
should
be
affirmed
with
reference
to
that
as
being
turned
loose
--
they're
being
turned
loose.
then
you
said,
“but
we
have
evidence
that
there
was
fraud
committed
by
these
people
on
the
court.”
would
that
justify
in
--
or
that
reason
alone
sending
the
case
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
difference
in
that
so
far
as
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
double
jeopardy
question
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
--
maybe
that
is
not
double
jeopardy
but
the
problem
i
have
in
my
mind
is
just
wholly
a
problem
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
know.
but
the
problem
i
have
in
my
mind
is
that
if
you
didn't
have
these
question
and
we
found
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
would
it
be
our
duty
in
your
judgment
to
send
the
case
back
on
new
trial
or
to
reverse
and
order
it
dismissed,
which
--
which
would
be
the
proper
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
this
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
since
the
chief
has
given
you
the
time.
i
may
say
that
i
wish
you
had
not
talk
so
much
about
jurisdiction,
as
i
see
the
point,
it's
not
the
point
--
it's
not
the
point
of
jurisdiction.
what
you
are
saying,
as
i
understand
it
and
i
want
to
see
if
i
(inaudible),
you
say
that
the
when
the
government
was
on
a
criminal
case,
it
must
put
on
all
its
evidence
that
it
covers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
does
not,
we'll
take
now
first
a
verdict
--
a
verdict
of
guilt
(inaudible)
that
instance
if
the
government
can't
change
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
rule
apply
where
the
evidence
off
--
the
evidence
offered
which
goes
to
the
jury
in
considering
which
goes
before
the
court
in
connection
with
the
motions
such
as
the
motion
to
suppress
because
of
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
so
forth.
and
it's
the
duty
of
the
government
to
present
its
evidence
and
even
if
there
is
a
conviction
that
the
government
is
bound
by
that
record
with
reference
to
that
name
if
it
hasn't
put
on
all
its
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
under
--
the
--
the
jeopardy
you
say
has
ended
when
that
record
is
examined
by
the
appellate
court
on
the
record
that
you
said.
now,
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
your
point
is
good
or
bad.
it
seems
to
me
that
issue
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
you
are
saying
that
since
the
government
should
not
be
permitted
after
a
conviction
has
--
after
an
acquittal
has
been
--
conviction
has
been
obtained.
and
the
defendant
desires
to
have
that
conviction
examined
in
the
appellate
court
on
the
record,
the
government
should
not
be
permit
--
permitted
to
add
to
that
record
evidence
which
it
did
not
see
fit
or
could
because
it
didn't
have
anything
else.
that
it
did
not
offer
in
the
original
trial.
and
therefore,
to
permit
that,
would
violate
the
rule
of
--
of
double
jeopardy
in
the
--
the
jury,
the
man
was
entitled
to
have
the
jury
that
tried
him
first
to
act
on
that
with
the
absence
of
some
emergency
like
a
hung
jury
or
cyclone
or
storm
or
something
that
knocks
the
court
down.
and
that
your
--
your
claim
that
the
rule
with
reference
to
the
government's
duty
to
offer
evidence
is
just
as
binding
on
to
double
jeopardy
and
when
it
examines
a
motion
before
the
court
as
though
it
was
offered
to
the
jury
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
do
not
see
myself
in
a
point
of
jurisdiction.
maybe
you
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
had
any
cases
--
have
you
had
any
cases?
have
you
looked
up
to
see
if
there
are
any
cases?
i
assume
that
there
wouldn't
be
--
i
don't
know.
but
i
don't
doubt
as
there'd
be
much
dispute
that
the
government
--
of
the
government's
view
is
to
put
on
all
its
evidence
in
a
case
of
the
defendant's
right
to
have
that
evidence,
that
record
to
his
conviction,
adjudged
by
the
evidence
standing
before
the
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
dispute
comes
in
connection
with
the
motion
by
the
government
here
to
remand
in
order
to
get
everything
in
connection
with
the
subsidiary
motion
made
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
that
which
you
have
say
or
you
have
raised
is
consistent
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
with
which
i'm
agreeable,
in
which
he
said,
“you
can't
defy
the
court
of
jurisdiction
and
protect
itself
from
fraud
in
the
absence
of
some
constitutional
barrier
to
setting
aside
a
judgment.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
you
can
leave
out
the
last
one.
