mr.
george
b.
christensen
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
waste
very
much
of
my
valuable
time
on
preliminary
matters
but
i
would
like
to
pick
up
what
mr.
elman
left
off.
number
one,
when
this
disclosure
was
made,
every
single
item
of
gross
income
was
disclosed.
you
will
find
in
you
records
these
photostatic
reproductions
that
show
every
single
item
of
alleged
gross
income
that
has
ever
been
called
into
question.
number
two,
with
respect
to
the
so-called
destroyed
records,
a
thing
that
was
greatly
amplified
by
judge
nordbye,
it
was
not
records,
it
was
one
record
and
as
best
it
is
described,
it
was
a
little
foolscap
piece
of
paper
that
had
on
it
some
notations
covering
a
portion
of
the
time
in
which
over-ceiling
payments
were
received
and
over-ceiling
payouts
were
made.
precisely,
what
its
contents
were,
no
one
knows
except
those
who
made
it
and
they
did
not
explain
it
in
any
great
detail.
it
could
not
in
any
event
have
been
material.
now,
that's
enough
for
that.
and
remember
always
that
this
disclosure
was
made
in
the
year
1948
when
the
treasury
maintain
and
said
in
so
many
words
not
by
oral
testimony
alone
but
by
the
published
regulations
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
that
we
will
allow
no
credit
or
your
so-called
over-ceiling
payouts
for
raw
material.
and
i
don't
care
what
the
perjury
lawyers
now
say
about
how
agents
had
to
investigate
how
this
money
was
spent.
the
published
regulations
prohibited
every
agent
of
the
treasury
from
1948
until
after
this
indictment
in
1942
from
allowing
a
taxpayer
one
dime
of
credit
for
anything
spent
on
the
black-market
no
matter
if
he
came
in
with
gold
engraved
receipts
to
show
who
he
paid
it
to
and
what
he
paid
it
for.
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
imminently
correct
and
it
used
the
only
term
that
could
possibly
use
when
it
said
that
the
treasury
disavowed
this
disclosure
simply
because
it
was
trying
to
get
these
taxpayers
to
turn
informer
on
the
recipients
of
their
payments
who
of
course
might
have
proved
to
be
tax
violators.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now,
that's
all
there
was
to
it.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
it
is
not.
i
say
these
are
preliminary
matters
but
they
came
up
and
they
apparently
had
been
troubling
some
members
of
the
court
and
i
wish
to
lay
them
at
rest.
now,
as
to
the
disclosure
policy
which
is
not
precisely
an
issue
as
the
argument
has
developed,
i
think
mr.
elman
has
embroidered
that
considerably
by
his
reference
to
the
statement
saying
he
had
to
have
good
faith,
he
had
to
make
a
full
disclosure
and
do
this,
but
i'm
not
going
to
rely
upon
memory.
but
here
is
what
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
said
about
it.
the
simple
statement
--
this
was
his
announcement,
the
simple
statement
“i
have
filed
false
tax
returns
and
one
who
make
the
government
whole,
constitute
a
complete
disclosure.”
now,
later
on,
you've
got
to
go
in
and
get
the
tax
straightened
out.
the
treasury
always
has
the
right
to
make
its
own
investigation.
once
you
took
them
off,
there
was
something
wrong.
measured
by
that
test,
the
simple
statement
“i
have
filed
false
tax
returns
and
want
to
make
the
government
whole
would
constitute
of
complete
disclosure”.
there
can
be
no
doubt
when
these
people
went
in
and
said
they
have
filed
false
tax
returns
and
offered
and
had
been
offering
from
that
date
of
this
to
pay
their
taxes.
there
can't
be
any
doubt
they
made
a
good
disclosure.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
they
are
different
but
that's
not
the
case
before
it.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
not
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
theoretically,
that
would
be
true.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
they
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
they
didn't
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they
did
a
lot
to
more
than
that
judge
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
this
is
the
most
complete
disclosure
that
i
think
you
will
find
recorded
in
all
the
disclosure
cases
on
the
books.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
but
that's
again
not
this
case.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
all
right.
we
can
lay
that
--
that
particular
problem
aside
then
i
think.
now,
the
--
it's
a
very
disconcerting
thing
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar,
the
court
one
day
and
the
next
day
stand
up
and
look
at
the
courts
acquiring
the
base
and
say
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
but
that
is
the
position
that
i
find
myself
in.
the
order
that
was
entered
here,
denied
certiorari,
you
have
nothing
for
you
--
before
you
for
a
review.
you
have
a
naked
motion.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
that
is
not
the
form
justice
brennan,
but
when
you
read
that
order
you
--
i
can't
see
that
in
substance
it's
anything
but
a
denial
when
you
say
we
are
granting
certiorari
but
limiting
the
issue
to
a
matter
that
isn't
covered
by
the
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
that
is
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
don't
know
how
--
how
you
can
do
that.
you
--
you
--
to
inform
your
order
is
a
granting
of
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
i
would
think
not.
it
doesn't
go
to
a
pleasant
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
the
motion
to
remand
as
amended
says,
“this
is
the
prayer.
this
i
take
it
is
what
basically
is
before
the
court.”
we
submit
that
the
interest
of
justice
would
be
served
by
remanding
this
case
to
the
district
or
a
further
hearing
to
amplify
the
record
by
enabling
the
parties
to
present
new
additional
evidence
on
the
timeliness
of
the
alleged
disclosure.
after
such
hearing,
the
district
court
would
make
such
further
findings
and
orders
if
any
of
the
facts
the
law
may
require.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now,
that
--
that
does
not
go.
it's
true
the
case
involved
the
disclosure
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
as
i
read
the
prayer
of
that
motion,
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
fairly
be
said
that
they
are
attacking
anything
that
the
court
of
appeals
did.
they
are
saying,
“we
want
another
goal
with
this
people.”
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh
yes,
we
do.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
you're
dealing
here
with
a
criminal
case.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
perhaps
--
i
don't
want
to
bet
any
words
with
you.
let
--
let
me
answer
it
this
way.ever
since
united
states
versus
sanges,
in
the
entire
history
of
this
court,
insofar
as
i
know
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence.
in
a
criminal
case,
the
sovereign
gets
one
goal
at
a
citizen.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
that's
about
--
i've
said,
i
perhaps
didn't
follow
you.
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
no
more
than
you
--
than
there
is
a
question
of
your
power
to
consider
--
to
consider
it
now.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
authority
for
once
the
--
there
is
no
criminal
appeal
provided
the
united
states
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
sanges
says
you
can't
have
a
second
go
at
a
citizen.
you
held
unanimously
last
june
in
carroll
versus
the
united
states
that
the
powers
of
the
sovereign
to
seek
a
new
trial
were
very
limited
there.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
and
you
--
you
construed
the
statute
very
narrowly
in
the
light
of
the
common
law
history.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
am
not
speaking
in
legal
parts.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
what
you
have
here
and
we
have
said
it
repeatedly
in
our
briefs,
is
a
motion
for
a
new
trail
whether
it
is
presented
to
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
district
court.
the
essence
of
what
the
government
is
asking
you
is
precisely
what
mr.
justice
black
put
his
finger
on
a
while
ago.
it's
a
new
trial.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
it
virtually
is
under
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
broad
definition
(voice
overlap).
now,
they
say
it's
not.
they
say
we
would
merely
want
to
put
in
more
evidence.
but
anytime
you
ask
a
court
which
has
decided
a
combined
issue
of
fact
and
law
to
change
that
determination
after
decision
has
been
made,
you
say
“i
have
new
evidence
i
wish
to
give
to
you”
which
is
what
they
are
saying.
you
are
asking
for
a
new
trial
and
a
new
determination.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
substantial
legal
difference
between
--
saying
that
record
is
bad
because
there
was
perjury
or
that
record
is
bad
because
we
now
got
new
evidence.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
but
they're
saying
witnesses
at
the
--
whether
the
issue
be
determined
by
a
jury
or
by
a
court.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
legal
difference.
they
are
saying
the
witnesses
that
judge
nordbye
relied
on
committed
perjury.
that's
what
they
claim.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
that's
a
fair
summation
of
it.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
difference
with
this
horrible
cry
of
perjury.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
that's
--
that
is
true.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
never
arrive
at
the
point
where
you're
going
to
have
a
civilized
system
of
jurisprudence.
you
can
break
a
trial
up
and
say
that
a
subsidiary
question
that
determines
the
admissibility
of
evidence
will
go
at
that
two
or
three
times,
but
on
a
question
going
to
the
precise
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
of
the
crime
that
the
sovereign
can
have
only
one
goal
at
it.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh,
yes.
the
court
never
--
the
court
never
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they
never
passed
on
that.
they
passed
only
on
this
issue.
we
have
maintained
that
they
should
have
passed
on
and
they
should
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
quite
a
different
thing
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
take
a
confession
of
error
to
a
law
enforcing
officer.
and
he
comes
in
and
say
“here
i
have
made
a
mistake.
i
think
i
have
unjustly
convicted
this
citizen.”
and
do
what
you
did
in
mesarosh
regardless
of
how
you
do
it
whether
it'd
be
done
directly
here
or
whether
it'd
be
sent
back
to
the
trial
court.
it's
very
a
laudable
thing
and
is
--
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
our
law.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
allow
a
prosecutor
to
come
in
and
say,
“now,
i
figured
out
some
things
and
they
say
we
didn't
appreciate
all
our
evidence
and
i
want
to
have
another
goal
with
this
--
at
this
fellow.”
and
an
adversary
of
proceeding,
i
understand
that
to
be
except
where
statute
provides
for
an
appeal
to
the
sovereign
that
once
they
defend
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
that's
what
they're
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
hypothetically.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
correct
and
i
say
this.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
if
that
be
the
fact,
now,
let's
get
down
to
a
matter
of
policy.
if
that
be
the
fact,
if
you
assume
on
that,
the
government
is
not
without
remedy,
the
court
is
not
without
remedy,
you
don't
start
out
the
old
case
all
over
again.
clark
versus
the
united
states
says
that
perjury
does
not
lose
the
quality
of
contempt
simply
because
it
is
perjury
and
you
can
indict
these
people
for
perjury
and
while
we
are
talking
about
this
tainted
record.
the
fact
is
that
that
grand
jury
that
you've
heard
so
much
about
sat
in
chicago
from
some
date
in
april
1946
until
two
days
after
this
court
entered
its
order
on
february
25
and
then
out
came
this
great
big
voluminous
indictment.
now,
the
coincidence
of
those
dates
is
rather
remarkable.
this
indictment
was
prepared
somebody
sitting
down
at
a
typewriter
and
writing
it
out
between
the
time
word
was
flashed
to
chicago
that
the
supreme
court
had
as
we
say
in
effect
denied
certiorari
and
the
27th
when
it
was
released
to
the
newspapers
and
sent
out
to
these
people.
and
that
indictment
does
not
charge
these
people
with
perjury.
what
mr.
elman
read
to
you
were
allegations
of
overt
acts
in
this
so-called
conspiracy
count.
there
is
no
direct
charge
of
perjury
against
anyone
of
these
people
with
respect
to
a
single
item
of
evidence
relative
to
this
disclosure.
the
perjury
counts
that
are
in
that
indictment,
be
they
good
or
bad,
relates
solely
to
evidence
that
was
given
on
the
trial
as
to
the
merits
and
in
effect
what
they
are.
they
had
the
government's
chief
witness
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
lubben
who
has
developed
quite
a
reputation
for
perjury.
you've
heard
about
him
in
one
of
your
earlier
arguments.
i
believe
justice
brennan
you
insisted
that
the
man
ought
to
get
disbarred
up
in
your
state
because
he's
been
mixed
up
with
this
fellow.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
and
you
got
--
he's
suspended
i
think.
you
voted
for
disbarment
and
the
court
suspended
him
for
five
years
or
something.
but
in
any
event,
the
perjury
in
here
is
every
time
lubben
said
one
thing
on
the
merits
and
our
people
who
theretofore
were
citizens
of
unblemished
reputations
and
the
other,
this
new
indictment
says
our
people
were
guilty
of
perjury.
now,
that's
neither
here
nor
there
but
that
indictment
was
showed
on
the
back
of
the
story
while
this
part
was
meditating
what
to
do
with
the
certiorari
applications.
and
then
it
came
out
and
when
you
read
the
indictment
although
they
use
the
words
perjury
and
bribery
and
all
this
in
it.
they
are
in
the
means
of
allegations
or
they
are
in
the
overt
act
allegations.
there
is
nobody
indicted
for
perjury
here.
sauber
is
not
indicted
for
giving
perjured
testimony
on
this
suppression
hearing.
busby
isn't
indicted.
cain
isn't
indicted.
none
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
on
this
suppression
hearing
are
indicted
for
perjury.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now,
that's
the
practical
situation.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
do.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
that
when
you
have
a
criminal
case,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
so.
i
think
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
it
goes
beyond
double
jeopardy.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
think
that
--
that
a
criminal
case
in
all
its
brackets
is
tried
on
the
theory
that
all
the
incidents
of
a
trial
take
place
up
to
judgement.
once
that
judgment
be
it
of
conviction
or
acquittal
that
that
record
is
closed
and
ended
and
neither
the
trial
court
nor
a
court
of
review
may
open
up
that
record
and
splice
something
new
onto
it
to
bolster
up
or
support
the
result
already
achieved.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
would
think
not.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
he
would
have
to
go
back.
he
gets
a
new
trial.
your
rules
provide
him
a
new
trial.
he
doesn't
add
additional
evidence
to
support
or
the
defendant
wouldn't
be
appealing
or
going
pretty
fast
in
these
questions.
you
may
be
getting
me
a
little
beyond
my
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
but
here,
the
defendants
were
--
were
convicted
and
appealed.
now,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
the
criminal
case
which
way
it
goes.
the
trial
is
a
unit.
the
mere
fact
that
this
was
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing,
it
seems
to
us,
makes
no
difference.
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
trial.
the
prosecutor
proceeds
at
his
peril
and
must
put
in
his
case.
when
it
is
in,
it
is
complete
and
you
don't
let
him
go
back
either
of
the
trial
court
or
a
court
of
appeal
and
add
something
on
there
and
say,
“no,
this
proves
i
was
right
all
along.”
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
constitutional
principle,
the
due
process
of
law
that
has
been
recognized
for
centuries
that
a
criminal
trial
can't
be
broken
up
and
that
it
must
be
tried
at
one
time
is
of
equal
importance
to
the
purity
of
the
courts.
now,
the
court
need
not
go
on
to
them.
the
perjury
has
been
committed.
if
perjury
has
been
committed
here
and
the
court
had
been
defiled,
this
grand
jury
could
have
indicted
sauber
and
busby
and
these
people.
there
isn't
any
problem
here
about
justice
going
on
to
then
if
that
had
happened
or
conceivably,
it
hasn't
occurred
currently
to
these
gentlemen,
but
i
would
see
no
problem
or
whatsoever
if
this
was
true
of
the
trial
court
proceeding
upon
the
grounds
of
contempt.
but
once
you
depart
from
the
principle,
you
try
that
criminal
case
and
there
it
is.
the
government
has
only
such
appeal
as
it's
provided
by
statute.
it
has
no
right
to
a
new
trial
to
put
on
new
evidence
or
they
just
discovered
perjury
or
not.
if
there
was
perjury,
indict
for
perjury
and
convict
them
if
you
can.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
the
defendants
by
statute
and
by
common
law
are
given
many
rights
from
criminal
cases
and
rightly
so
that
the
sovereign
never
has.
the
rule
provides
that
a
defendant
may
have
a
new
trial.
this
--
this
supports
criminal
rules
and
the
laws
of
all
the
states.
now,
the
government's
right
of
appeal
in
criminal
case
is
circumscribed
by
statute
and
circumscribed
of
course
quite
rigorously.
and
if
there's
a
vital
--
a
vital
difference
and
that
it
seem
to
me
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
very
serious
principle.
once
--
once
you
permit
this
sort
of
thing
because
there
is
the
widest
variation
of
fact
testimony
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
you
find
that
in
united
states
versus
sanges.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
--
i
don't
say
that
--
and
i
said
this
court
has
--
has
ample
powers
to
deal
with
but
not
in
the
original
criminal
case,
not
by
letting
him
supply
evidence
into
the
original
criminal
case.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that
--
if
you
assume
those
facts,
that
would
be
the
fact
and
you
then
have
to
make
your
choice.
is
it
safer
for
society
to
run
that
risk
or
is
it
--
or
to
turn
it
into
the
hands
of
every
prosecutor
where
there's
a
difference
in
testimony
or
it
discovers
new
evidence
to
say
perjury
and
start
it
all
over
again.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
would
--
i
would
still
suggest,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
there
is
no
--
i
cannot
point
any
more
than
my
distinguished
opponent
has
been
able
to
appoint
to
any
case
that
is
ever
passed
upon
this
precise
issue.
i
don't
know
that.
certainly
the
government
doesn't
say
it.
and
certainly,
i
can't
dispute
when
you
say
that
u.s.
versus
sanges
does
not
in
term
specify.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
the
essence
and
means,
i
--
i
read
that
as
expressing
precisely
what
i'm
talking
about.
i
think
that
is
the
philosophy
of
it
and
should
be
the
philosophy
of
our
whole
system
of
government.
now,
that
concludes
our
--
our
time.
i
thank
you
for
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
we
have
--
have
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
towards
the
issues
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
what
--
that's
what
we're
saying.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well
i
--
when
i
was
asking
a
question
--
answer
a
question
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
i
was
talking
across
purposes
in
using
the
language
of
jurisdiction.
i
--
we
rest
upon
that
the
basic
concept
that
you
just
put
to
us
now
if
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
your
honor
let
me
answer
that
this
way.
our
research
may
have
been
insufficient
but
we
looked
and
searched
and
i
am
sure
that
the
mr.
solicitor
general
did
and
no
one
has
come
up
with
a
case.
there's
a
point
on
these
facts
and
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
solid
grain
in
the
whole
system
of
criminal
jurisprudence,
precisely
what
you're
talking
about
no
one
has
ever
carried
this
kind
of
a
point
into
a
court
the
last
resort
where
it's
been
reported.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now,
there
maybe
something
at
some
state
courts
somewhere
that
we
have
missed.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
would
answer
that
the
same
way
i
did
that
the
right
of
a
court
to
protect
itself
from
a
verdict
or
a
judgment
obtained
by
fraud
of
course
must
be
protected.
but
the
right
to
criminal
process
in
accordance
with
our
established
processes,
as
a
due
process
of
law
and
not
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
equally
sacred
and
where
the
two
come
in
conflict.
if
they
do
here,
you
still
don't
have
much
of
a
real
problem
in
the
administration
of
justice
because
the
court
can
be
protected
at
any
time
and
very
adequately
by
an
indictment
for
perjury
and
indictment
for
obstruction
of
justice
in
the
precise
question
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
by
contempt
actions.
there
are
any
numbers
of
means.
the
courts
need
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
your
question
precisely
as
you
put
it
for
this
reason.
well,
i
will
tell
you
why.
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
i
will
not
quote
it
precisely,
but
in
substance
it
says,
“the
case
is
remanded
with
directions
to
grant
the
motion
to
suppress
and
retry
the
case.”
now,
insofar
as
any
of
this
new
evidence
goes
to
the
question
of
suppression,
i
take
it
that
that
mandate
would
prevent
use
of
that
evidence
for
that
purpose.
if
they
have
other
evidence
bearing
on
collateral
features
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
he
did
not.
he
did
not
testify.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
suppose
that
under
the
literal
language
of
that
mandate
that
even
if
huebner
was
permitted
to
testify,
any
district
judge
would
have
to
say
i
don't
care
what
he
testifies.
the
court
of
appeals
has
told
me
to
grant
the
motion
to
suppress
and
i've
got
to
grant
it.
well,
that
is
the
literal
--
because
of
that
strong
warning
of
that
mandate.
i
don't
see
how
a
district
court
could
do
anything
else
other
than
that.
thank
you.
