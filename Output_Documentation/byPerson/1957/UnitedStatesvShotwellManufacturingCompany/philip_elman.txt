mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
the
writ
being
limited
to
the
questions
presented
by
a
motion
to
remand
which
the
government
has
filed
in
this
court
and
by
the
answer
made
thereto
by
the
respondents.
this
is
a
criminal
tax
evasion
case
in
which
the
defendants,
the
respondents
here
were
convicted
after
a
trial
lasting
five
weeks.
the
record
in
the
case
is
of
formidable
proportions
covering
some
nine
volumes
and
5,000
pages
of
testimonies
and
exhibits.
but
nevertheless
we
believe
that
the
only
issue
that's
presented
to
your
honors
at
this
posture
of
the
litigation
is
a
very
narrow
one
that
it
is
essentially
a
question
of
judicial
administration
that
does
not
call
for
any
adjudication
on
the
merits
by
the
court.
now,
in
broad
outline,
the
case
is
this.
the
defendants
were
the
shotwell
manufacturing
company,
the
chicago
illinois
corporation
engaged
in
the
manufacturing
sale
of
candy
and
its
three
chief
officers
and
stockholders,
cain,
its
president,
sullivan,
its
executive
vice
president
and
general
counsel,
and
huebner,
its
vice
president
and
general
manager.
the
indictment
returned
in
march
1952,
charged
them
with
willfully
attempting
to
evade
a
large
part
of
the
corporations
income
taxes
the
years
1945
and
1946.
the
unreported
income
alleged
by
the
indictment
consisting
of
almost
a
half
million
dollars
in
cash
in
the
nature
of
so-called
black-market
payments
which
the
company
received
from
its
customers
in
excess
of
the
opa
ceiling
prices.
now
after
the
indictment
was
returned
but
before
the
trial,
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
certain
evidence
which
they
said
they
had
turned
over
to
the
government
as
part
of
a
voluntary
disclosure
made
in
january
1948
in
reliance
of
what
was
then
the
voluntary
disclosure
policy
of
the
department
of
the
treasury.
now,
at
this
point
by
way
of
background,
i
should
describe
briefly
what
that
general
policy
was.
it
was
first
publicly
announced
in
1945.
it
continued
for
about
seven
years
until
january
1952
when
it
was
publicly
abandoned
and
withdrawn
by
the
then
secretary
of
the
treasury,
mr.
schneider.
it
was
never
promulgated
in
the
form
of
statute
or
regulations
or
any
other
such
formal
forms.
the
found
expression
gathered
in
press
releases
and
speeches
that
were
made
by
treasury
officials
during
that
period.
and
as
described
by
these
officials,
the
policy
was
intended
to
encourage
delinquent
taxpayers
to
come
forward
voluntarily
in
their
own
free
will
before
any
investigation
have
been
begun
by
the
treasury,
and
to
make
a
full
disclosure
of
their
liability.
and
if
that
was
done,
if
there
were
such
a
disclosure
that
was
made
in
good
faith
disclosure
that
was
sufficient,
disclosure
that
was
timely
then
the
policy
of
the
treasury
department
as
it
was
stated
was
not
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
to
the
department
of
justice.
but
in
each
of
these
pronouncements
by
the
officials
concerned
always
two
elements
were
stressed.
first,
the
disclosure
had
to
be
a
real
disclosure.
it
had
to
be
intended
to
reveal
information
and
not
to
conceal
it.
it
had
to
be
made
in
good
faith
and
it
had
to
be
a
full
disclosure.
the
second
requirement
was
that
it
would
be
timely
that
had
come
before
the
treasury
was
on
dissent
of
something
wrong
that
come
before
the
investigation
and
not
after.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
started
in
--
it
was
publicly
announced
as
a
policy
in
1945.
it
was
withdrawn
in
19
--
early
in
1952
for
a
period
of
about
seven
years.
we
are
not
--
i
would
not
wish
the
court
to
understand
that
the
government
is
contending
that
because
the
policy
was
expressed
in
an
informal
way
but
that
detracted
in
any
way
from
its
validity
or
from
its
significance.
it
was
the
policy.
the
fact,
however,
that
it
was
expressed
that
way
did
detract
from
its
--
from
the
clarity
and
the
precision
of
the
policy
and
there
were
considerable
uncertainties
and
fuzziness
as
to
just
exactly
when
a
disclosure
was
timely
and
when
it
was
sufficient
and
those
were
the
reasons
which
led
secretary
schneider
in
january
1952
to
abandon
the
policy
is
unworthy.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
opposed
the
motion
to
suppress.
it
denied
that
there
had
been
a
voluntary
disclosure
that
was
sufficient
and
timely
and
made
in
good
faith.
the
factual
issues
does
raise
were
canvassed
by
the
district
judge,
judge
nordbye
sitting
by
special
designation.
at
a
three-day
hearing
--
mr.
philip
elman
judge
nordbye
of
minnesota
sat
in
this
case
by
special
designation
of
the
then
chief
justice.
the
issues
at
that
hearing
were
issues
as
to
which
the
defendants
of
course
being
the
moving
parties
has
the
burden
of
proof.
at
the
close
of
the
hearing
when
all
of
the
evidence
was
in,
judge
nordbye
found
that
the
motion
to
suppress
should
be
denied.
later
he
filed
a
memorandum
setting
forth
in
detail
his
findings
of
facts
and
his
reasons
for
finding
that
this
disclosure
was
not
a
disclosure
at
all.
it
was
made
not
in
good
faith
for
the
purpose
of
revealing
information
but
rather
that
it
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
misinforming
the
government
agent
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
information
that
was
relevant
in
the
computation
of
a
tax
liability.
that
it
was
a
fraud.
now,
the
defendant's
version
of
the
facts
as
set
forth
at
the
hearing
was
that
they
had
disclosed
the
receipt
of
this
--
of
these
black-market
payments.
but
however,
that
they
had
expended
all
that
money
to
their
suppliers
from
whom
they
could
purchase
raw
materials
only
by
paying
over-ceiling
prices.
and
they
had
--
they
said
that
these
payments
to
their
suppliers
in
effect
cancelled
out
payments
that
they
had
received
from
their
customers.
and
that
while
on
their
returns
they
had
reported
neither
the
receipts
nor
the
payments.
there
was
in
effect
a
washout
from
the
tax
standpoint
since
as
they
claim
as
it's
the
law
the
payments
were
deductible.
however,
they
refused
to
reveal
the
names
of
the
persons
to
whom
these
payments
were
made
and
judge
nordbye
found
their
story
that
they
had
turned
over
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
cash
to
face
this
man
which
was
the
term
given
by
the
defendants
in
their
testimony.
he
found
that
story
completely
unworthy
of
belief
and
on
a
basis
of
--
of
the
facts
or
in
the
basis
of
the
evidence
i've
indicated
plus
the
fact
that
as
judge
nordbye
found
not
only
that
the
defendants
concealed
information,
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
treasury
agency
in
giving
information
that
was
relevant
in
concluding
that
tax.
beyond
that,
they
had
destroyed
records
which
they
had
in
the
black-market
transaction.
they
fabricated
figures
as
to
the
amounts
involved
which
they
--
the
figures
which
had
been
turned
over
to
the
treasury
agents
where
as
judge
nordbye
found
admittedly
fictitious.
mr.
philip
elman
they
were
both
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
now,
i
like
to
add
further
on
this
--
on
the
basis
for
judge
nordbye's
findings.
that
he
found
a
destruction
of
the
records
as
to
the
black-market
transactions
in
all
aspects.
he
found
that
the
story
in
the
figures
that
were
given
were
taken
out
of
thin
air,
were
wholly
fictitious.
mr.
philip
elman
well
my
recollection
of
the
record
sir
is
that
it
was
both.
i
stand
corrected
i'm
sorry.
it's
just
that
this
disbursements
as
to
the
hearing
before
judge
nordbye,
my
recollection
of
the
trial
record
was
that
the
records
covered
both
black-market
purchases
and
the
black-market
with
that
of
the
sales.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
--
that
is
their
--
that
was
their
testimony
sir.
but
even
on
the
basis
of
that
version
of
the
facts
they
were
claiming
a
deduction.
they
were
offering
these
alleged
facts
as
a
basis
for
they're
not
having
paid
any
taxes.
it
was
certainly
the
obligation
of
the
revenue
agents
to
determine
whether
these
deductions
that
were
being
claimed
had
any
substantial
basis
in
facts,
whether
in
fact
this
black-market
money
that
came
in
to
shotwell
has
been
dispersed
as
business
expenses.
it's
part
of
the
materials
that
entered
into
the
manufacturing
of
the
product
which
they've
sold.
now,
i
should
add
further
to
that
that
the
defendant's
story
as
told
to
the
revenue
agents
was
that
all
of
the
money
that
came
in
went
out
in
precisely
the
same
amounts.
so
that
therefore,
in
or
--
if
you
were
going
to
consider
only
the
question
of
computing
how
much
came
in
the
shotwell
which
is
concededly
gross
income,
since
there
was
a
parallel
between
that
amount
and
the
amount
that
went
out,
the
revenue
agents
would
have
every
justification
for
inquiring.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
that
was
then
the
treasury's
position
that
the
issue
was
in
litigation
and
ultimately
the
treasury
acquiesced
in
a
possession
taken
by
various
courts
of
appeals
that
they
were
deductible.
mr.
philip
elman
the
court
of
appeals
did
act
on
the
basis
that
the
information
as
to
what
shotwell
did
with
the
black-market
cash
that
came
in
was
wholly
irrelevant
and
the
determination
of
the
tax
consequences
of
the
receipt.
now,
there
is
--
the
government
certainly
takes
issue
on
the
law
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
i
don't
think
if
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
go
in
to
the
merits
of
that
but
i
do
think
i
should
point
out
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
agents
in
1948
when
this
alleged
disclosure
as
on
the
defendant's
version
was
made
to
them.
they
certainly
would
have
been
wholly
remiss
in
their
duties
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
accepted
the
defendant's
statement
that
all
these
money
went
out
and
--
to
persons
who
were
unidentified
in
amounts
that
were
admittedly
fabricated.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
taxpayer's
position
was
that
he
held
no
additional
taxes
at
all.
when
shotwell's
accountant
and
president
cain
came
in
and
as
they
said
in
january
1948,
there's
some
dispute
as
to
when
that
meeting
took
place,
their
story
was
not
--
we
have
defrauded
the
government.
we
are
here
to
furnish
you
with
amended
tax
returns
and
we
are
tendering
additional
payments
of
tax.
their
story
was
we
failed
to
include
in
our
tax
returns
some
items
of
gross
income
amounting
to
several
hundred
thousand
dollars.
however,
we
don't
know
of
any
additional
taxes
because
we
also
neglected
to
report
in
our
returns
that
we
paid
out
these
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
and
for
that
reason,
we
don't
owe
you
anything
but
we're
just
telling
you
this.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
had
happened.
mr.
philip
elman
now,
the
question
as
to
whether
that
really
happened,
whether
that
was
actually
what
took
place
is
--
i
would
say
a
question
on
the
merits
which
this
court
at
least
the
government,
the
petitioner
here
is
not
asking
your
honors
to
review.
we
have
taken
the
position
throughout
this
entire
litigation
and
beginning
to
end
and
i
reiterate
it
now
that
from
the
government's
--
from
the
government's
view
that
is
not
what
happened.
but
even
if
it
did
happened
that
way,
certainly,
a
revenue
agent
who
asked
for
information
as
these
taxpayers
were
questionably
asked
at
a
later
stage
after
this
first
meeting
with
the
man
named
sauber,
he
was
the
chicago
field
deputy
who,
which
i
shall
point
out
later,
is
now
been
indicted
for
a
charge
of
conspiracy
and
perjury.
but
certainly,
at
a
later
stage,
there
was
absolutely
no
question
and
the
defendant
so
testified
that
they
refused
to
give
that
information
even
when
the
treasury
agents
asked
for
it.
even
after
the
tax
court
in
november
or
december
1948
had
held
in
the
sullenger
case
that
so-called
--
these
so-called
black-market
disbursements
were
deducted.
and
there
was
no
question
at
all
that
it
was
very
much
of
a
legal
issue.
and
after
(voice
overlap)
excuse
me.
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all.
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all.
mr.
philip
elman
that
is
our
--
that
is
our
position,
sir.
this
--
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation,
our
position
is
this.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
judge
nordbye's
findings
of
facts
that
there
was
not
a
valid
disclosure.
the
court
of
appeals
found
either
rightly
or
wrongly,
we
think
at
this
point
is
not
important,
we
think
wrongly.
in
any
event
(voice
overlap)
--
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
finding
of
fact
on
this
record
that
judge
nordbye
was
required
on
the
evidence
presented
to
him
to
conclude
that
the
disclosure
was
valid.
and
beyond
that,
the
court
of
appeals
found
affirmatively
that
the
disclosure
was
timely.
judge
nordbye
had
refrained
from
making
any
finding
as
the
timeliness
of
the
disclosure
as
to
when
the
investigation
has
began
because
on
his
view
there
never
was
a
disclosure
at
all.
but
the
court
of
appeals
affirmatively
made
such
a
finding.
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
considering
that
in
this
case
there
had
been
a
departure
from
the
established
standards
governing
appellate
review
of
factual
determinations
in
such
a
degree
as
to
why
they're
invoking
these
supervisory
powers
of
this
court.
that
was
on
october,
1955.
within
a
period
of
about
six
weeks,
they
began
to
develop
a
sequence
of
events
that
did
not
detracted
from
the
unusual
character
of
this
case.
the
matters
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
and
they
form
the
basis
of
the
submission
which
the
government
is
making
here
that
the
case
should
not
be
decided
on
the
merits.
the
government's
request
for
review
of
the
case
on
this
record
should
not
be
accepted
at
this
time
but
rather
that
in
the
broad
interest
of
justice
in
the
interest
of
judicial
administration,
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
now
what
are
these
new
matters
upon
the
basis
of
which
this
unusual
request
is
made?
it
was
called
to
the
court's
attention
that
beginning
--
that
some
time
in
the
middle
of
1955
while
this
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
began
to
be
entertained
in
the
minds
of
some
officials
of
the
internal
revenue
service
in
washington,
suspicion
as
to
the
regularity
or
irregularity
in
handling
of
tax
cases
in
the
chicago
field
office.
that
as
a
result
of
those
suspicions,
a
full
scale
investigation
was
initiated.
on
december
1st,
1955,
the
department
of
justice
was
informed
by
the
chief
counsel
of
the
internal
revenue
service
that
that
investigation
has
gone
forward
sufficiently
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
there
--
that
in
the
record
of
the
shotwell
case,
this
case,
there
were
false,
perjurious
statements
that
were
made.
on
the
basis
of
that
representation,
the
solicitor
general
asked
this
court
the
preferred
consideration
of
its
--
of
the
government's
petition.
and
thereafter,
the
motion
to
remand
which
is
the
basis
of
--
which
is
before
your
honors
in
this
argument
was
--
was
filed
in
october
of
last
year.
now,
the
investigation
initiated
by
the
internal
revenue
service
led
to
a
grand
jury
inquiry.
the
grand
jury
inquired
into
the
question
of
whether
in
the
trial
of
this
case
there
had
been
perjury,
bribery,
corruption,
fraud,
obstruction
of
justice.
as
the
result
of
its
inquiry,
the
grand
jury
in
february
of
this
year
has
returned
an
indictment.
the
defendants
named
in
the
indictment
are
the
shotwell
company,
cain,
one
of
the
defendants,
one
of
the
respondents
here,
sullivan,
and
two
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
one
of
them
being
sauber
who
is
the
man
to
whom
this
alleged
disclosure
in
january
1948
was
supposed
to
have
been
made.
the
conspiracy
is
in
ten
counts.
the
indictment
is
in
ten
counts.
count
one,
the
main
count
of
the
indictment
to
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
a
chronology
is
set
out
in
appendix
for
our
brief.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
the
motion
to
remand
originally
was
filed
in
october
of
1956.
certiorari
was
granted
and
limited
the
questions
i'm
now
arguing.
i
believe
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
february
25
and
several
days
later
came
the
indictment.
that
--
that
is
the
present
posture
of
litigations.
your
honors
have
before
you
not
only
the
indictment
which
alleges
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
among
all
these
people
to
conceal
information
at
the
time
the
alleged
disclosure
was
made
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
evade
taxes
as
to
the
proceeds
of
these
black-market
transactions.
but
in
addition,
the
indictment
on
page
vii,
specifically
charges
that
it
was
a
part
of
that
conspiracy
that
the
defendants
and
coconspirators
would
make
false
and
fraudulent
representations
and
statements
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
the
department
of
justice
and
to
the
district
court
in
this
case,
concerning
alleged
voluntary
disclosure
purportedly
make
the
internal
revenue
service
in
1948.
and
it
alleges
specifically
on
page
xvi
that
cain,
busby,
the
accountant
for
shotwell
and
sauber.
the
three
parties
to
this
alleged
disclosure
gave
false
testimony
at
the
suppression
hearing
before
judge
nordbye
as
to
this
disclosure.
mr.
philip
elman
we
think
--
we
think
not.
we
think
that
the
only
court
which
is
equipped
to
hear
this
--
to
determine
whether
these
charges
and
only
are
this
charge
--
whether
these
charges
have
any
factual
basis,
and
if
so,
what
the
significance
and
legal
consequences
should
be
as
to
trial
court.
i
would
add
only
one
further
fact
in
addition
to
the
indictment.
we
have
in
this
case
the
extraordinary
fact
that
one
of
the
three
defendants,
one
of
the
three
respondents
in
this
court
has,
in
effect,
repudiated
the
testimony
of
his
codefendant
at
the
trial
and
he
has
joined
with
the
government
in
asking
for
(inaudible).
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
it
is
not
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
government
is
not
asking
about
it.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
we
are
asking
for
a
remand
for
the
district
court.
the
district
court
may
explore
the
issues
raised
by
these
allegations
in
a
furthered
hearing.
the
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
considered
by
the
judge
without
a
jury.
it
was
a
pretrial
issue.
it
didn't
--
the
issue
is
collateral,
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
a
new
trial.
we
are
asking
--
we
--
the
government's
essential
position
is
that
on
this
record,
there
are
sufficient
--
there
is
a
sufficient
cloud
that's
been
generated
by
these
new
allegations
so
that
it
should
be
removed
and
the
proper
tribunal
for
removing
this
cloud
is
the
district
court
which
can
receive
evidence
and
can
make
a
full
exploration
of
the
issues.
we
think
that
so
far
as
the
question
of
judicial
administration
is
concerned,
there's
no
--
really
no
difference
between
the
--
the
problem
in
this
case
and
that
in
the
mesarosh
case
and
the
remmer
case
and
the
subversive
activities
control
board
case.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
trial
--
the
trial
court
of
course
was
considering
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
disclosure
there
involved
an
inquiry
into
the
motions
of
the
disclosure
to
that
extent
and
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
but
the
trial
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
are
--
we
are
saying
that
the
grand
jury
and
one
of
the
defendants
have
made
charges
that
--
in
--
in
effect,
a
fraud
was
perpetrated
on
the
judicial
process
that
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
is
here
at
stake
that
--
in
--
and
a
full
inquiry
is
called
for.
we
--
we
don't
think
that
this
court
should
make
it.
we
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
equipped
to
make
it.
we
think
that
on
the
showing
that's
made,
the
only
disposition
of
the
case
that's
--
that
appears
to
us
and
we
--
we
are
not
arguing
this
as
a
matter
of
point
as
an
interest
because
from
the
standpoint
of
the
government,
the
findings
of
facts
made
by
judge
lindley
are
amply
supported
by
the
evidence
on
this
record.
and
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
consider
the
case
on
this
record
which
we
do
not
argue,
we
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
at
this
time,
we
are
not.
we
can
argue
but
--
but
if
the
court
should
conclude
not
to
remand
the
case,
we
would
--
we
would
think
that
the
one
alternative
that
the
court
should
reject
would
be
the
alternative
of
leading
and
standing
in
full
and
final
effect
a
disposition
of
the
case
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
which
they're
now
serious,
substantial
and
unresolved
charges
with
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
with
the
product
of
perjury.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
but
the
court
--
whether
the
court
should
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
do
that
and
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
in
view
of
the
court's
action
on
--
on
the
petition,
i
have
attempted
to
avoid
liking
any
arguments
on
the
merits.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
as
it
now
stands
your
--
your
alternatives
or
either
to
send
the
fact
to
the
district
court
or
the
lead
standing
if
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
despite
the
fact
that
these
charges
have
been
made
leaving
them
unresolved,
from
our
point
of
view,
we
think
that
there's
a
cloud
here
that
has
to
be
dissipated
this
--
simply
as
a
matter
of
judicial
administration.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
would
hope
that
would
be
so,
i
wouldn't
be
altogether
certain
in
view
of
the
doctrine
which
was
disparagingly
referred
to
you
yesterday
as
the
law
of
the
case.
mr.
philip
elman
if
the
court
of
--
if
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
there
and
the
petition
in
certiorari
has
been
denied
and
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
motion
to
suppress
should
be
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
directed
a
new
trial.
this
--
the
government
does
not
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
pardon.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
unless
this
court
where
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
that
procedure
was
open.
i
should
think
that
the
--
there
might
be
some
litigation
on
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
final.
but
as
to
that,
let
me
say
that
we
think
that
the
situation
here
is
very
much
like
the
situation
in
mesarosh
where
this
court
was
able
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
the
showing
made
by
the
government
that
there
was
no
--
that
a
remand
to
a
lower
court
would
--
would
be
time
consuming.
this
--
if
the
case
were
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
assuming
the
question
would
be
open,
mr.
christensen
and
i
would
be
briefing
and
arguing
the
very
question
that
is
now
here
whether
the
case
should
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court.
that
--
needless
time
would
be
consumed
in
a
criminal
proceeding
which
has
already
lasted
since
march
of
1952.
mr.
philip
elman
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
us
that
on
the
basis
of
what
your
honors
have,
there's
nothing
that
the
court
of
appeals
will
have
because
the
court
of
appeals
can't
take
any
evidence
as
to
these
allegations
any
more
than
this
court
can.
on
the
basis
of
what
you
have,
you've
got
a
substantial
taint
on
the
record
in
the
criminal
case.
you
have
allegations
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
led
to
decide
the
case
as
it
did
because
accredited
testimony
which
a
grand
jury
now
says
was
part
of
a
prearranged
scheme
to
defraud
the
united
states.
now,
you
didn't
have
that
issue
before
judge
nordbye
to
begin
with.
he
was
considering
the
--
the
disclosure
simply
as
whether
it
was
sufficient
or
whether
it's
timely.
the
government
at
that
time
didn't
argue
or
present
evidence
to
judge
nordbye.
this
so-called
disclosure
was
part
of
the
scheme
to
fix
the
case
that
have
involved
corruption
and
involved
bribery
and
involved
perjury.
we
didn't
argue
that.
we
have
no
evidence
at
that
time.
mr.
philip
elman
the
grand
jury
indictment
is
only
a
charge.
we
--
we
don't
have
any
facts
here.
we
have
allegations
of
facts
and
the
only
question
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
the
question
is
whether
these
allegations
which
have
been
made
by
the
grand
jury
as
to
this
case
should
stand
unresolved,
should
this
court
--
should
this
court
leave
--
either
leave
standing
the
disposition
rate
of
this
case
that
was
made
by
court
of
appeals
or
should
it
do
something
else?
now,
we
--
these
matters
were
submitted
by
the
government
because
it
appeared
to
us,
to
raise
a
question
as
to
how
this
court
should
handle
the
matter
whether
--
on
the
basis
of
the
present
record,
we
petitioned
for
certiorari.
we
haven't
in
any
respect
abandoned
our
--
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
record
was
embarking
on
a
trial
de
novo
that
it
was
making
findings
of
fact
that
contrary
to
those
made
by
the
judge
who
heard
the
evidence.
that
--
that
is
still
our
position
but
we
don't
--
we're
not
asking
you
to
accept
it
at
this
time.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
if
the
--
the
writ
were
now
granted
unlimited,
we
would
also
make
the
alternative
argument
to
the
court.
we're
not
suppose
to
follow
that
course
but
--
mr.
philip
elman
that
we
would
--
we
would
want
to
be
heard
on
the
merits.
it's
not
on
the
merits
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
reverse.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
we
are
relying
on
the
broad
provision
incorporated
in
section
2106
of
the
judicial
code
which
i
think
is
just
a
codification
of
the
settled
inherent
power
of
this
court
to
remand
the
cause
and
direct
the
entry
of
such
appropriate
judgment,
decree
or
order
or
require
such
further
proceedings
to
be
had
as
maybe
just
under
the
circumstances.
now,
certainly
this
court,
there's
a
suggestion
that
there's
nothing
before
your
honors
for
review,
but
certainly,
the
petition
for
certiorari
brought
the
case
here
for
review
and
that
--
that
petition
wasn't
denied,
it
was
granted
but
limited
to
the
issues
which
are
now
being
argued.
your
honors
have
a
case
before
you
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
this
case.
and
the
question
is
what
disposition
of
the
case
would
be
just
under
the
circumstances.
now,
i
--
i
think
it
would
--
the
parts
of
the
case
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
if
it
were
comparable
in
mesarosh
where
certiorari
had
been
granted.
if
--
if
these
matters
had
come
before
your
honors
after
a
grant
of
certiorari,
we
would
be
as
mr.
justice
harlan
indicated
in
the
same
position,
we
would
still
not
be
asking
this
court
to
review
the
cases
--
case
on
the
basis
of
this
kind
of
a
record.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
power.
mr.
philip
elman
the
question
--
the
question
is
one
of
judicial
management.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
--
i'm
saying
--
mr.
philip
elman
i'm
saying
--
i'm
saying
that
when
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
presented
to
the
court
along
with
the
motion
to
remand,
the
court
had
before
it,
the
choice
of
really
three
alternatives.
the
court
could
have
granted
our
petition
in
which
case
the
case
would
have
been
reviewed
on
the
basis
of
the
present
record.
it
could
have
granted
the
motion
to
remand
or
set
the
case
down
for
argument
on
that
motion
and
then
--
and
we
were
so
disposed,
grant
the
motion
and
send
it
back
to
the
district
court.
or
the
third
alternative
that
the
court
would
have,
the
alternative
which
--
for
which
--
which
will
be
urged
my
mr.
christensen
speaking
for
all
of
the
respondents
except
mr.
huebner.
that
third
alternative
would
be
to
deny
both
and
leave
the
court
of
appeals
decision
where
it
founded
despite
the
attacks
--
well,
that's
not
the
right
term,
despite
the
--
the
allegations
which
have
been
made
that
the
foundation
of
that
decision
was
infected
with
perjury.
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
all
of
those
alternatives
are
open
to
the
court
as
a
matter
of
power,
if
i
may
answer
you
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
there's
no
question
as
the
court's
power.
the
question
is
--
which
will
best
serve
the
interest
of
justice
and
we
think
that
the
faster
this
case
gets
back
to
the
district
court
which
--
which
heard
evidence
in
the
trial
lasting
so
--
so
many
weeks
and
had
a
hearing
on
this
very
motion
to
suppress
and
saw
the
witnesses
and
saw
the
case
unfold.
that
court
and
that
court
alone
is
in
the
position
to
determine
what
disposition
should
--
should
now
be
made
of
these
matters.
now,
i
--
i
think
if
the
case
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
court
would
have
nothing
that
your
honors
don't
have.
and
--
and
we
are
not
coming
to
you
with
facts,
we're
coming
to
you
frankly
with
--
with
allegations
but
they're
serious
allegations
and
they
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
judicial
process.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
if
the
case
were
still
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
would
be
no
question
about
it.
if
the
case
were
in
this
court,
it
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
this
court
should
remand
that
matter
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
for
determination
but
i
--
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
want
--
i
want
to
emphasize
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
for
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
has
entered
the
judgment
which
is
before
this
court
for
review.
it's
not
a
final
judgment
of
acquittal.
you
have
no
question
of
double
jeopardy
as
you
had
the
other
day.
that's
a
judgment
which
is
before
the
--
this
court
for
review.
in
that
situation,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
representations
are
made
for
this
court,
which
are
substantial
enough
to
justify
your
honors
in
concluding
that
a
fraud
was
perpetrated
on
the
court
of
appeals,
i
should
think,
your
honors
will
want
to
do
something
about
it.
i
should
think
you
would
have
the
power
at
least
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
what
may
be
troublesome
in
the
hypothetical
case
you
put
is
this.
if
you
have
an
acquittal,
if
you
got
a
jury
acquitting
--
mr.
philip
elman
but
--
but
that's
--
that's
what
troubles
--
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
source
of
difficulty.
if
you
got
an
acquittal
and
the
jury
acquits
a
man
on
the
basis
of
perjured
testimony
and
of
course
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
government
can
come
up
later.
now,
there's
a
big
difference
between
a
jury
acquitting
the
defendant
and
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
review
of
a
conviction
entering
a
judgment
whether
it's
a
judgment
directing
a
new
trial
or
a
judgment
directing
the
case
be
dismissed
or
what.
that
judgment
presumably
would
be
subject
to
review
by
this
court
when
this
court's
review
attaches,
the
court
has
full
power
to
make
a
just
disposition
of
it
without
impairing
any
constitutional
right
of
double
jeopardy
or
anything
of
the
sort.
now,
if
--
if
the
government
in
that
hypothetical
case
or
just
to
say
“well,
we've
got
new
evidence
and
nothing
more
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
what
kind
of
new
evidence
there
is.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
there'd
be
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
and
you'd
be
deciding
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
think
in
this
case,
you
don't
have
the
problem
of
acquittal,
the
jury.
this
is
--
this
is
a
pure
--
a
question
purely
for
the
judge
sitting
without
the
jury.
judge
nordbye
can
hear
evidence
in
this
case
tomorrow
if
you
were
so
in
kind,
the
parties
were
ready
without
reconvening
--
convening
a
new
jury
without
having
a
new
trial.
the
purpose
of
the
remand
here
would
be
comparable
to
the
purpose
in
the
--
in
the
remmer
case.
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
doubt
generated
by
the
record
as
to
whether
justice
had
really
been
done.
and
then
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
powers
was
sending
the
case
--
would
be
sending
the
case
back
to
the
lower
court
to
find
out
what
the
facts
were
and
do
what
the
facts
and
what
the
law
and
what
justice
required.
mr.
philip
elman
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
comment
on
that,
i'd
like
to
--
i
don't
think
that
is
this
case
because
in
this
case,
it
isn't
a
question
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
government's
evidence.
it
is
the
government
which
prevailed
in
the
trial
court
on
this
issue
where
the
--
where
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
that
it's
not
because
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
but
this
isn't
the
case,
mr.
justice
black,
where
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
we
didn't
have
enough
evidence.
this
is
a
case
where
the
--
where
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
defendants
had
evidence
and
that
that
evidence
should
be
accepted
as
true
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes
because
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
the
double
jeopardy
question
arises
unless
you've
got
a
jury
equivalent.
and
from
our
point
of
view,
the
case
being
here,
this
--
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
it
--
of
its
powers
could
--
could
make
the
disposition
that
we
suggest,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
anyone
has
urged
that
would
violate.
double
jeopardy
would
be
subjecting
a
man
to
a
second
trial
twice
for
the
same
offense
anymore
than
the
court
of
appeals
disposition
in
this
case
sending
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
second
trial
by
the
constitutional
rights
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
philip
elman
it's
a
real
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
don't
--
i
can't
concede
that
in
this
particular
case
any
appellate
court
would
--
would
direct
dismissal
of
the
--
of
the
indictments.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
certain
evidence
should
be
suppressed
for
use
at
the
trial.
there
was
no
question
at
all
that
the
evidence
presented
at
the
trial
would
sufficiently
support
the
conviction
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
i
--
i
would
not
argue
that
without
this
evidence,
the
conviction
would
be
sufficient
because
i
--
i
just
don't
know
how
much
evidence
would
remain.
but
i
do
concede
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
in
its
premise
that
this
motion
to
suppress
should
have
been
granted
then
the
proper
disposition
was
a
new
trial
and
not
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
just
a
second
to
answer
further
mr.
justice
whittaker's
questions
as
to
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
as
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
as
to
this
fabricated
figures
and
the
destruction
of
records.
when
--
your
question
was
first
asked
as
to
whether
the
records
that
were
destroyed
related
to
both
the
black-market
payments
and
the
receipt,
i
answered
that
they
did.
i
--
perhaps,
this
led
you
later
on
by
retracting
that
answer.
i
--i
now
stand
on
my
original
answer.
we
had
checked
the
records.
the
records
were
destroyed
by
the
defendants
related
to
both
what
they
got
and
what
they
--
unless
they
paid
out.
and
the
record
references
are
on
pages
11,
16,
and
17
of
our
brief.
mr.
philip
elman
i
misled
you.
mr.
philip
elman
we
--
we
have
thought
it
was
immaterial.
