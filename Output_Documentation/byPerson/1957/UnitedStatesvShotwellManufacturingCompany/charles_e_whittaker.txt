mr.
elman,
may
i
ask
you
that.
were
the
records
that
were
destroyed,
those
relating
only
to
access
prices
over-ceiling
prices
paid
for
raw
material
or
did
those
destroyed
records
also
include
the
receipts
by
the
taxpayer
for
over-ceiling
prices
for
goods
sold.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
both?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
to
receipts
as
well
as
to
disbursements
or
just
the
letter?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
reason
i
ask
these
questions
is
that
i
think
this
has
some
bearing
upon
the
treatment
given
by
the
court
of
appeals.
isn't
it
true
that
when
the
taxpayer
went
to
the
bureau's
agent
the
bureau's
agent
said,
“we
will
not
under
our
present
policy
allow
offsetting
claims
for
excess
prices
paid
for
raw
material?”
and
did
not
the
taxpayer
then
say,
“well
we
litigate
about
that,
we'll
pay
whatever
taxes
you
--
on
receipts
we've
had
and
then
we
will
sue
for
refund
on
the
remainder.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
does
not
the
court
of
appeals
find
out
that
the
bureau
at
that
time
have
not
acquiesced
the
cases
holding
that
excesses
paid
for
raw
materials
over-ceiling
prices
was
not
deductible.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
was
the
basis
or
one
of
the
bases
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
holding
was
it
not,
that
a
full
disclosure
had
been
made
because
the
income
of
excess
over
ceiling
prices
had
been
disclosed.
and
it
was
immaterial
as
to
whether
or
not
the
excesses
paid
could
be
deducted
because
the
taxpayer
had
said
that
they
litigated
about
that
question
and
meanwhile
pay
whatever
the
government
said
was
due.
isn't
that
the
basis
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
acted?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
that
make
any
difference
though
if
the
taxpayer
was
willing
to
pay
without
regard
to
those
deductions?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it
wasn't
right
then
--
was
it
right
then
if
i
may
interrupt
that
the
agent,
revenue
agent
said,
but
we
wouldn't
allow
it
anyway.
it's
out
policy
not
to
allow
such
payments
and
therefore
the
taxpayers
were
reported
in
this
evidence
you
have
said
and
the
court
of
appeals
finds
they
did.
that
we'll
pay
the
tax
regardless
of
those
deductions
and
then
we
will
litigate
in
an
action
to
refund
about
the
other
question.
isn't
that
what
they
said?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.

court?

chris

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
matter
in
issue
here?
