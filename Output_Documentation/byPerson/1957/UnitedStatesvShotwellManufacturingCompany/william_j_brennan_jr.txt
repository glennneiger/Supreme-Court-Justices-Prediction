justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
say
denied?
that's
not
the
point
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
even
by
extension
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
that
the
questions
on
the
government's
petition
included,
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
there
and
misapplying
the
so-called
voluntarily
disclosure
policy
of
the
treasury
department
with
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
in
fact
does
not
the
motion
concerned
itself
with
allegations
which
it
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
did
or
didn't
misapply
the
so-called
voluntary
disclosure
policy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
concern
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
except
--
except
to
mr.
christensen.
actually,
this
is
what
happened.
the
conviction
was
based
upon
evidence
which
the
government
was
allowed
to
offer,
after
the
defendant
sought
to
prevent
the
government
from
using
it
because
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
within
the
disclosure
policy.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
was,
“no.
on
this
record,
we
think
that
the
government
was
and
that
judge
nordbye
should
have
held
that
the
government
was
stopped
from
using
that
evidence”.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
the
government
come
forward
and
has
said,
“but
the
witnesses
upon
holding
the
government
rely
to
show
that
we
were
not
stopped.”
where
in
fact
in
a
criminal
fraudulent
conspiracy
with
the
defendants
to
give
a
version
which
is
the
version
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
whereas
in
fact
we
can
establish
that
that's
not
the
true
version
at
all.
and
therefore,
judge
nordbye
whether
right
on
what
was
then
before
it,
we
can
now
show
what's
right
in
fact
after
we've
had
an
opportunity
to
prove
the
facts
which
we
now
allege.
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
is
that
--
is
that
the
old
classical
idea
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
is
that
a
very
different
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
evidence
doesn't
go
to
guilt
or
innocence
of
these
defendants.
it
only
goes
to
the
question
whether
the
government
shall
be
allowed
to
use
the
evidence
upon
which
they
in
fact
did
secure
from
a
jury
or
verdict
of
guilt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
differ
it
from
mesarosh
except
that
perhaps
it's
the
other
side
of
the
coin
in
mesarosh?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
government
came
in
and
said
that
we
secure
this
conviction
and
we're
now
satisfied
that
the
evidence
which
the
jury
heard
was
perjured
evidence.
and
the
government
doesn't
want
to
stand
by
a
conviction
obtained
in
that
way.
now,
here
the
government
says
and
the
fact
these
defendants
have
secured
a
reversal
on
admittedly
sufficient
evidence
so
far
as
--
i
don't
understand
there
was
any
claim
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
evidence
which
sustained
the
conviction
was
insufficient
with
respect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
never
passed
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
to
get
back
to
my
question
however.
in
fact
all
the
government
saying
here
is
we
relied
on
certain
witnesses,
busby
and
sauber
to
establish
that
we
should
not
be
stopped.
it
now
develops
that
the
defendants
here
secure
the
reversal
of
their
conviction
because
sauber
and
busby
in
conspiracy
with
cain
and
others,
gave
a
story
which
was
not
in
fact
true
and
we
want
to
show
that
that's
the
case.
but
why
isn't
that
mesarosh?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
we
didn't
appreciate
it.
but
didn't
they
say
--
are
they
saying
we
don't
--
we
didn't
appreciate
our
evidence
at
that
time
on
--
we
want
a
chance
to
practice
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
--
are
they
saying
that
or
are
they
saying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
we
were
--
well,
i
know,
but
(voice
overlap)
the
substance
whatever
language
they
use,
aren't
they
saying
that
in
actual
fact
busby
and
sauber
with
cain
and
the
others
worked
this
thing
up
to
do
the
government
in
on
its
insistence
that
it
had
the
right
to
use
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
disbarred.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
christensen
before
you
sit
down
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
an
appropriate
question.
don't
feel
that
you
should
answer
if
you
think
you
should
not.
as
things
presently
stand,
there's
to
be
a
new
trial
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
disposition
of
the
court
of
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
carry
the
proposition
which
you
have
just
been
discussing
with
mr.
justice
black
so
far
as
to
say
that
on
this
new
trial,
if
we
should
sustain
your
position
on
this
motion
that
the
government
would
be
stopped
from
using
this
new
evidence
in
the
new
trial
against
these
defendants
before
a
new
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
supposed
mr.
huebner
for
example
would
have
testified
now,
now
that
he's
gone
over
to
the
government's
side.
he
didn't
testify
on
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suppose
the
government
is
to
be
denied
under
the
proposition
that
you've
been
supporting?
do
you
