justice
felix
frankfurter
are
any
of
these
questions
now
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
this
question
before
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals,
assuming
it
was
right
on
the
record
that
it
had
which
this
court
does
not
seem
fit
to
review.
assuming
that
it
was
right
and
one
must
start
with
that
assumption
in
the
state
of
this
record.
that
on
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
it
reached
the
right
result.
developments
have
occurred
since
then
which
the
government
thinks
call
for
consideration
on
what
you
call
reasons
of
judicial
administration.
isn't
that
the
only
case
before
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
well,
i
caught
right
that
the
indictment
of
which
you
speak
into
which
you
are
about
to
refer
was
after
the
various
proceedings
which
led
to
the
--
to
the
granting
or
to
the
final
papers
filed
either
by
the
government
or
by
the
respondents
on
the
various
petitions
and
motions
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
february
25.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
elman.
assuming
--
assuming
that
the
proceedings
today
do
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
preclude
consideration
by
this
court
of
this
motion
which
you're
addressing
this
time,
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
motion
can't
reopen
what
is
not
reviewed
now
namely
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
is
there
any
--
there
is
passing
on
the
motion
--
is
passing
on
the
motion
possible
except
for
a
tribunal
that
has
power
to
hear
witnesses
and
subject
them
for
examination
and
cost
of
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
be
said
that
the
issue
which
is
raised
by
this
motion
was
in
any
way
on
issue
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying,
as
i
understand
the
government's
motion,
it
says
here
there
is
such
corruption
in
the
proceeding
that
the
court
himself
respect
and
do
regard
for
what
courts
have
thought
should
not
allow
this
to
remain
without
being
inquired,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can't
argue
that.
you
cannot
argue
that
at
this
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
couldn't
do
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
do
what
you've
just
asked
us
to
do
in
alternative
unless
we
modify
what
this
court
did
in
regard
to
the
petitions
and
the
cross-petitions
for
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
can.
all
i'm
saying
is
we
have
to,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
present,
the
way
--
the
way
the
petition
and
cross-petition
was
dealt
with,
that
issue
is
not
now
open
unless
this
court
--
assuming
he
doesn't
do
what
the
government
asked
to
be
done,
it
would
have
to
modify
what
it
previously
--
how
it
previously
dealt
with
those
petitions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
--
whether
you
agree
or
not
that
on
--
as
the
--
as
the
disposition
of
the
petition
and
cross-petition
stand,
we
couldn't
review
without
modifying
our
disposition.
we
couldn't
review
the
merits
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
could
come
here
or
the
other
side
could
come
here
depending
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
we
didn't
bring
this
case
here
in
order
to
bring
nothing
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
would
get
down
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
two
other
alternative,
if
i
may
suggest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
that
justice
harlan
suggested
in
which
you
erase
the
difficulty
and
i
think
a
real
difficulty
mainly,
that
if
this
court
dismisses
this
case
as
--
as
though
nothing
was
before
it
and
i
think
a
technical
argument
could
be
made
on
that
fact
in
view
of
the
way
in
which
we
dealt
with
the
petition
for
which
i
do
not
wish
to
disclaim
responsibilities
as
far
as
i
have
in
the
end
as
one
person.
but
if
what
justice
harlan
suggested,
it
sent
--
its
dismissal
is
made
here
or
the
case
is
sent
back
where
dismissal
is
made
here
and
it
is
explicitly
stated
that
it
should
not
be
the
so-called
law
of
the
case
that
is
without
prejudice
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
allowed
with
this
motion
on
the
merits.
that's
another
alternative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
alternative
is
if
we
have
granted,
we
could
have
granted
the
motion
there,
the
government's
petition
of
certiorari.
we
could
have
granted
what
the
government
there
asked
us
on
the
merits,
namely,
to
review
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
petition
and
the
interest
of
judicial
decency
sent
this
particular
aspect
of
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
determination.
that
would
have
been
another
alternative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
take
your
time
on
irrelevancy.
but
is
it
the
same
to
say
we've
made
false
disclosures
period
and
making
disclosures
which
themselves
are
false.
there's
a
difference,
isn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
and
i
agree
that
this
isn't
before
us
at
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
these
people
said
they
came
in
and
said
mr.
treasury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
filed
--
we
made
false
disclosures
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
the
rest,
we
just
tell
you
that
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can
follow
that
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
is
taking
even
your
statement
and
your
quotation
from
the
then
secretary
of
the
treasury.
it's
one
thing
for
delinquent
taxpayer
to
say,
(inaudible)
i
have
not
filed
an
honest
return
and
go
ahead
and
send
your
people
in.”
and
another
thing,
to
give
figures
which
partly
are
false
and
partly
suppressed
the
truth.
that's
the
very
different
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
case
is
and
i'm
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
that
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
statutory
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
appeal
--
this
is
a
criminal
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
your
reply,
in
your
response
to
the
government
motion,
you
didn't
remotely
suggest
you
wouldn't,
you're
too
good
a
lawyer
but
the
government
cannot
appeal
from
the
adverse
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
happens
all
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
the
case
coming
from
your
jurisdiction,
the
famous
johnson
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
government
does
has
one
goal.
that
is
an
illegal
way
of
stating
out
(voice
overlap)
situation,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
why
we're
here.
we're
talking
lawyers.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
establish
that
proposition.
that
is
an
axiomatic
thing
but
this
is
a
motion
for
new
trial.
i
think
it
isn't
remotely
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
don't
--
it
is
an
axiomatic
proposition
that
this
motion
is
a
motion
by
the
government
for
new
trial
after
acquittal,
is
it?
is
that
an
axiomatic
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
asking
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
decision
on
a
pre-trial
motion
which
determination
of
that
pre-trial
motion,
they
say,
“i
do
not
know.”
i
couldn't
possibly
know
is
infected
with
perjury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
they
are
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
to
me
is
a
very
different
thing
from
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
i
couldn't
think
of
anything
more
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
saying
that
the
witness
is
at
the
trial
which
brought
in
a
verdict
committed
perjury.
that
is
what
this
motion
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
suppose
as
judge
nordbye's
decision
in
favor
of
the
government
and
an
appeal
by
you
from
his
decision,
seeking
to
reverse
it.
and
before
the
case
came
on
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
government
move
that
court
on
the
following
basis.
it
says,
“we
have
not
decided
here
that
judge
nordbye
will
be
sustained
by
this
court.
but
it
has
come
to
our
notice,
circumstances
which
envelop
the
verdict
which
the
government
has
obtained
with
fraud
which
only
reinforces
the
verdict
which
the
government
has
obtained.”
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
that
motion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
he
has
lost,
he
has
the
criminal
--
what
do
you
call
the
criminal,
the
defendant
has
lost.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
has
a
verdict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
as
taking
anything
away
from
him.
it
is
things
of
the
court.
we
have
additional
matters
which
are
relevant
to
reinforce
a
verdict
against
the
defendant.
and
you
say
they
have
no
power
to
grant
such
a
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
double
jeopardy,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
more
than
double
jeopardy.
it's
triple
jeopardy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
defendant
could,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
was
--
he
was
appealing
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
have
some
legal
grounds,
double
jeopardy
i
can
understand.
but
overwriting
the
interest
of
a
partisan
unless
it
offends
double
jeopardy
is
the
protection
of
the
court
against
being
use
for
corrupt
purposes
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
interest
of
the
party,
unless
the
vindication
of
the
integrity
of
the
court
makes
some
inroad
on
a
constitutional
principle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
where
do
i
find
recognition
of
that
principle?
just
where
do
i
find
the
principle
that
you
stated
that
the
government
is
--
that
the
court
is
barred
from
cleansing
its
own
record
regardless
of
what
the
party's
to
the
enterprise
want
or
do
not
want
provided
no
constitutional
principle
is
infringed.
where
do
i
find
the
principle
which
seems
to
you
common
law
and
everything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
the
united
states
versus
sanges
for
the
whole
of
my
professional
life
and
all
that
says
is
that
although
there
wasn't
a
determination
on
the
merits,
the
government
is
not
allowed
on
appeal
(inaudible)
unless
the
--
unless
the
statute
gives
an
appeal.
that's
all
that
it
says.
that
(inaudible)
indictment
which
goes
against
the
government,
you
can't
appeal
although
it
doesn't
touch
double
jeopardy
as
a
matter
of
construction
just
as
this
court
have
said
as
matter
of
construction,
will
construe
criminal
statutes
leniently.
but
where
is
the
principle
that
when
there
is
alleged
and
we
must
assume
this
is
capable
of
proof
that
the
judicial
process
had
been
sort
that
--
that
this
court
is
powerless
to
deal
with
it.
where
is
that
principle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
supplies.
i
say
to
leave
a
corrupt
judgement
standing
on
the
books
of
the
courts,
standing
on
the
books
of
this
court
if
we'd
say
we
have
no
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
please
don't
--
i
must
convey
to
myself.
i
am
not
remotely
suggesting
that
what
the
government
claims
could
be
sustained
on
the
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
say
for
purposes
of
a
jurisdiction,
one
must
assume
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
--
in
essence
--
in
meaning
--
