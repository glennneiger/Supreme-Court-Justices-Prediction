how
long
that
policy
had
been
a
disclosure
policy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
we
should
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
we
granted
the
--
your
petition
for
certiorari
without
limitation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
i
suppose
you
would
have
been
arguing
or
you
are
not
to
hear
this
case
but
(inaudible)
or
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
investigation
of
these
charges.
justice
john
m.
harlan
made
your
argument
reversed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
want
to
be
heard.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
christensen,
supposing
this
court
has
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari
without
limitation
and
then
as
an
instance
to
grant
and
read
the
government's
motion
to
remand,
you
have
no
question
if
court
could
remand
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
questions
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction?
i'm
talking
about
jurisdiction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
wait
a
minute.
you're
not
answering
my
question.
my
question
is
addressed
to
power
to
consider
the
government's
motion
which
is
the
point
you're
making.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
(voice
overlap)
wouldn't
be
any
question
there
as
to
the
power
to
consider
whether
we
should
grant
it
or
not.
it's
another
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
dealt
with
the
defendants
too?
