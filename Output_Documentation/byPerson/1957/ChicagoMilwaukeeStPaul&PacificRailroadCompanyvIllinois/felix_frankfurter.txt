was
this
--
was
this
particular
local
service
--
out-of-pocket
service
a
unique
situation
or
did
it
apply
to
other
local
non-heavy,
non-dense
traffic
through?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
proceeding
in
1952
before
the
state
utilities
commission,
if
that's
what's
it
called,
merely
it
was
directed
to
agree
to
local
services,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
they
were
conspicuous
or
unique
instances
of
--
of
out-of-pocket
deficits.
never
mind
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
railroad
sold
--
earn
their
cost
on
every
item
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
what
--
what
made
this?
what
led
the
railroad
to
single
this
out
for
relief
from
the
state
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
was
at
the
side
of
the
deficit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
but
their
lack
of
services,
that
were
out-of-pocket
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
scope
of
inquiring
between
--
before
the
two
commission
is
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
this.
does
that
mean
--
am
i
to
infer
from
what
the
court
below
said
that
the
icc
reviews
or
must
act
on
the
record
made
before
the
state
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it
didn't
but
that's
what
it
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
in
this
proceeding,
the
order
which
we
are
reviewing,
the
commission
--
the
state
commission
was
a
part
--
was
before
it,
was
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
a
party
or
merely
sitting
like
the
trinity
brother
in
the
--
i
forgot
the
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
put
evidence
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
ought
not
to
the
matter
of
dispute
even
between
intense
counsel
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
state
commission
is
or
is
not
a
party
with
power
to
put
in
what
evidence
would
be.
that
ought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
to
be
a
matter
of
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
johns,
you
argue
this
as
though
this
is
a
question
of
what
i
might
call
common
law
as
a
matter
of
principle
that
we
work
out.
don't
we
have
to
go
to
the
statute
to
find
out
if
the
statute
requires
and
doesn't
require?
the
statute
says
something
about
this,
isn't
it?couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you're
dealing
with
state
rate
to
which
the
congress
is
concerned
with,
state
rates.
after
the
freeport
doctrine,
it's
ought
to
protect
the
state
and
they
did
it
in
a
particular
way
by
section
13
(3),
didn't
they?
namely,
that
they
must
give
the
state
notice
and
at
the
behest
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
state
commission
may
sit
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
doesn't
say
a
word
about
going
to
the
state
commission
in
the
first
instance,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
will
be
if
they
do
go
and
make
a
kind
of
a
shadow,
indulged
in
the
kind
of
shadowboxing
to
which
the
chief
justice's
question
referred,
may
commend
itself.
and
the
commission
could
say,
"you
go
back
there."
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
the
commission
do
that?
has
the
commission
done
that
as
a
matter
of
its
own
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
just
a
little
slap
under
this,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
commission's
report
which
indicates
that
if
these
high
rates
go
into
cost,
in
fact,
more
revenues
will
flow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
i
don't
mean
the
negative
but
if
this
keeps
up,
it
will
be
a
drain.
i
want
something
to
indicate
that
if
you'll
raise
it,
you
may
not
have
even
more
of
a
drain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
third?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
produce
substantial
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
the
--
that's
four,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
i
want
to
know
whether
in
the
--
in
the
--
those
are
the
conclusions,
in
the
report
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
itself.
was
there
evidence
on
that
point?
this
is
all
a
matter
of
prophesy
of
course
as
we
know,
isn't
it?
but
is
there
is
some
basis
in
the
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
challenged
by
the
respondents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
they
agree
that
if
the
higher
rate
was
produced,
would
less
be
the
deficit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
basis
for
this
forecast
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
it's
a
discrimination
against
commerce
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rather
than
a
relationship
between
rate
or
commodities
or
services.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
hitting
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
could
--
could
illinois
come
in
and
say,
“you're
trying
to
jack
up
our
local
rate
beyond
the
ratio
of
the
cost
of
the
rate
in
washington
or
some
other
state.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
be
--
you
can't
have
them
a
unit
under
themselves
regardless
of
the
unit
of
some
other
state
if
the
point
of
attack
is
to
drain
on
the
total
commerce
earning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
theory
of
13
(3),
formulate
extending
the
old
(3)
and
(4)
doctrine,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
is
whether
a
state
may
not
say
the
operation
of
this
is
to
make
the
incidence
of
increase
greater
for
us
in
a
comparable
situation
in
the
neighboring
state
or
even
in
the
distant
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
issue
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
merrill,
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't.
in
your
proceeding
before
the
illinois
commerce
commission,
did
you
ask
for
an
increase
of
rates
by
virtue
of
the
transportation
act?or
did
you
ask
for
an
increase
of
rate
under
the
illinois
public
utility
act
if
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
a
far
cry
from
the
north
dakota
case
when
you're
dealing
with
a
major
--
perhaps
--
for
example,
certainly
a
major
portion
of
the
whole
traffic
of
the
railroad
to
these
little
local
suburban
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
midnight
was
a
very
important
part
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
traffic
in
the
north
dakota.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
total?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
total
--
what
is
the
proportion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
the
total,
your
total
revenue
in
illinois
from
this
suburban
traffic
should
be
deprived
with
its
measurable
--
commensurable
with
the
midnight
traffic
in
north
dakota.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
lot
of
money
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
lot
of
money
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
merrill,
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
though
i'm
not
at
all
sure
you're
the
person
i
should
ask
it
of.
i
probably
should've
asked
of
mr.
johns.
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
agrees
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
questions
1
and
2
relating
to
the
intrastate
rate
fixing
from
which
i
incurred
that
they
take
no
position
on
3
and
4,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
understanding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
assuming,
and
i'm
making
an
absolute
and
--
and
qualified
assumption
because
i
don't
know
what
i
think
about
it.
but
assuming
one
agrees
with
the
government
on
questions
1
and
2,
does
that
make
for
instance
the
setting
aside
of
the
interstate
rate
formed
by
its
own
cost?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
they're
tied
together,
aren't
they?
i
mean
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i'm
a
little
puzzled
with
that,
why
the
government
should
have
contracted
itself
out
of
the
--
particularly
the
fourth
question
because
that
means
the
interstate
rate
is
hanging
in
the
air.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
say,
you're
may
be
the
wrong
person
to
ask
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
be
--
it
will
be
agreeable
i
think,
we'd
like
to
have
light
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
6
of
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
didn't
--
the
law
did
set
it
aside,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
understand
if
they
say
they
only
agree
on
those
two
questions
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
that's
your
own
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
simply
means
that
that's
all
they
wanted
to
argue.
there's
just
one
brief
on
both
the
u.s.
and
the
icc.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
think
that
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
they
asked
this
court
to
review,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
findings,
you
mean
everything
that's
said
in
the
report
as
well
as
in
the
numbered
paragraphed
at
the
end.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
to
say,
if
they
show
there
is
a
heavy
drain,
a
heavy
deficit
on
a
particular
service,
what
else
would
they
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
--
does
that
mean
that
it
might
be
shown
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
carrier
agreed
at
a
lower
rate
and
which
order
to
be
carried
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
just
giving
you
an
extreme
illustration
of
--
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
size
--
would
you
say
that
a
sizeable
out-of-pocket
loss
in
carrying
particular,
if
you
please,
segregated
item
of
traffic
isn't
enough,
they
must
further
show
that
that
isn't
true
at
least
to
as
equal
in
extent
if
not
a
greater
extent
about
other
segregatable
items,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
discrimination,
perhaps
this
is
elaborate
on
what
you
mean
by
that
would
get
into
the
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
make
a
difference,
the
percentage
of
the
drag,
if
it
is
a
drag
and
the
rate
could
be
jacked
up
to
a
reasonable
level?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
if
that
meaning
would
be
satisfied
if
the
--
the
rate
which
is
being
charged,
though
out-of-pocket,
is
still
a
reasonable
rate,
what
that
means
in
the
rate
fixing.
you
don't
challenge
if
this
rate
considered
by
fairly
is
an
unreasonable
rate,
forget
for
the
moment
the
problem
we're
discussing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
said
in
effect,
here
is
the
deficit,
here
is
the
drag
as
you
call
it,
and
the
drag
is
due
to
the
fact
or
can
be
--
the
gap
can
be
build.
the
drag
can
be
removed
if
a
rate
is
imposed
which
is
imperfectly
reasonable.
i'm
not
without
knowledge
of
the
difficulty
of
that
clearly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
you're
talking
about,
namely,
that
the
rate
in
and
of
itself
couldn't
be
challenged
as
being
unreasonable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
they
say
that's
it
--
we
are
now
going
to
impose
a
reasonable
rate,
a
rate
which
is
reasonable
for
the
service
rendered
which
will
remove
the
drag.
that's
the
position
--
commission's
position,
isn't
it?
in
effect
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
that's
water
over
the
dam
since
the
wisconsin
case
in
1921.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
non-compensatory
rate
maybe
a
non-unreasonable
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
non-compensatory
rate
maybe
in
certain
circumstances
a
not
unreasonable
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
means
that
the
revenue
--
the
interstate,
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
i'd
like
to
have
your
light
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
not
an
easy
subject.
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
mean
a
depletion
of
the
revenue
of
a
carrier
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
due
to
intrastate
rate
which
is
not
reasonably
justified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
that,
too.
but
i
said
it
deplete
the
interstate
revenue
of
the
interstate
carrier,
the
affirmative
protection
of
which
was
one
of
the
chief
representative
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
sure.
if
the
interstate
carriers,
making
an
8%
profit
when
the
rates
are
3%
or
4%
for
--
for
capital,
certainly,
then
depletion
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
be
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you've
got
--
but
if
you've
got
an
income
that
isn't
within
that
level
and
is
still
between
a
reasonable
level
or
is
not
unreasonable
then
you
got
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
demonstrate
that
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
demonstrate
that
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
not
in
my
understanding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
not,
if
you'll
say
may
not,
then
i'll
believe
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i'll
agree
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
mean
--
may
i
pursue
this.
does
that
mean
you
must
compare,
you
must
have
a
ratio
between
the
rates
that
are
claimed
discriminatory
and
some
other
factor
of
the
income
of
the
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
you
had
of
course
a
great
problem
of
fixing
up
--
wiping
out
the
whole
--
the
whole
rate
structure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
suggesting
that
to
is
too
bloated
an
income,
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
the
other
way
around
is
true
to,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
if
the
intrastate
order
stand,
i
suppose,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
interstate,
that's
all
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
unfairly,
in
any
more
meant
then
that
the
disallowance
of
a
rate,
resulting
in
the
maintenance
of
an
existing
rate,
operated
and
it
is
claimed
in
violation
of
13
(3)
--
a
violation
of
13
(4),
does
mean
any
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
it
--
whether
it
becomes
a
farce
or
not,
the
fact
is,
i
quite
agree
with
your
starting
point
that
the
fixing
of
intrastate
rates
as
such
is
for
the
state,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
no
power
to
fix
an
intrastate
rate
as
such.
it
merely
as
the
power
to
deal
with
the
relationship,
the
bearing
of
an
intrastate
rate
either
specific
or
what
we
call
discrimination
against
commerce.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
difference
does
it
make?
what
the
proceeding
is?
what
your
local
law
is?
what
steps
are
taken
or
not
taken?
there
is
a
rate
which
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law
is
the
lawful
rate
within
illinois.
and
that's
the
result
of
the
proceeding
in
1952
before
your
commission,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
all
you
have
is
a
rate,
there
it
is,
by
law.
whether
that
is
--
whether
as
you
indicate.
it
goes
into
effect
if
nobody
objects
automatically
or
whether
it
goes
into
effect
at
a
certain
period
or
it
is
contested
and
then
it
is
--
it
is
the
legal
rate.
there
is
a
state
rate
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
no
power
to
touch
as
such

all
right.
now
what
--
what
difference
does
it
make
how
the
law
of
the
state
expresses
itself
in
saying,
this
is
the
state,
this
is
the
rate
within
illinois
which
illinois
and
illinois
alone
has
the
power
to
fix.

i
suppose
--
i
don't
know
your
law
but
i
suppose
it's
illegal
to
carry
freight
or
passengers
in
illinois
without
a
rate
being
on
file
or
being
authenticated

by

justice

mr.
guthrie,
can
i
ask
you
without
implying
that
it
is
the
same
but
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
railroad
could
in
the
first
instance
without
going
before
your
commerce
commission
at
all
have
gone
under
13
(3)
and
(4)
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
had
a
rate.
there
must
be
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you,
yourself
suggested
as
i
understood
you
that
you
don't
need
affirmative
approval
by
the
state
commission
for
a
rate
under
certain
circumstances,
is
that
right
in
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
but
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
a
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i'm
asking
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.what
i'm
asking
is
whether
--
no
matter
how
the
rate
came
into
being
under
your
local
procedure,
whether
--
without
going
to
the
commerce
commission
of
illinois
at
all,
the
railroad
could
have
gone
to
the
--
via
the
washington
interstate
commerce
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
some
legal
rate
enforced
in
illinois
whether
--
whenever
it
could
fix.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that.
i
--
that's
why
i
said
it,
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
say
it
did.
