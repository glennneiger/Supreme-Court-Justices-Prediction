mr.
harry
r.
begley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
illinois
commerce
commission
in
the
state
of
illinois.
i
shall
divide
the
appellee's
time
with
mr.
guthrie
who
represents
the
commuters'
association
in
which
it
was
a
very
active
protestant
both
before
the
illinois
commission
and
before
the
interstate
commission.
as
the
appellant
have
stated,
this
is
a
section
13
(4)
matter.it
raises
again
the
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
control
in
matters
of
this
kind.
i
know
this
court
has
reviewed
many
section
14
cases.
but
in
our
opinion,
this
case
presents
the
final
in
usurpation
of
the
state's
normal
authority
over
intrastate
rates.
if
the
lower
court
is
reversed
and
the
interstate
commission
report
and
order
allow
to
stand
in
the
last
(inaudible)
the
state
control
of
her
local
rates,
in
our
opinion
has
not
only
been
killed
but
effectively
buried.
briefly,
as
the
appellants
indicated,
this
matter
began
before
the
illinois
commission.
it
was
a
proceeding
for
"elimination
of
trains"
as
well
as
of
rate
interest.
it
affects
only
the
suburban
service
of
the
milwaukee
railroad
in
the
chicago
area.
after
a
considerable
hearings
in
about
3000
pages
of
testimony
and
exhibit,
the
illinois
commission
found
by
an
order
of
november
10,
1954,
upon
the
record
made
before
that
commission,
that
the
railroad
instead
of
suffering
an
out-of-pocket
loss
of
approximately
a
million
dollars,
actually,
upon
proper
allocating
of
expenses
and
by
dieselizing
their
suburban
service,
would
have
a
profit
of
approximately
$224,000.
now,
instead
of
appealing
the
order
of
the
illinois
commission
to
our
supreme
court
or
up
to
our
court,
that
the
order
was
contrary
to
the
manifest
weight
of
the
evidence
or
that
it
was
arbitrary
in
determining
the
out-of-pocket
--
by
out-of-pocket
expense
which
changed
an
alleged
deficit
into
a
profit.
the
railroad
elected
to
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
file
a
section
13
(3).
at
the
hearing
that
followed
before
the
interstate
commission,
the
railroad
introduced
other
evidence
that
had
been
entered
since
--
before
the
illinois
commission
which
contains
certain
expenses
which
they
claim
is
out-of-pocket
cost
on
their
depreciation
and
maintenance
of
way.
as
the
--
as
the
interstate
commission
bring
forth
a
comment,
respondent's
explanation
where
the
prior
omission
was
its
impression,
that
even
without
them
that
it
shows
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
--
a
considerable
deficit
from
this
service.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
this
explains
but
it
does
not
excuse
its
incomplete
showing
before
the
illinois
commission.
upon
the
evidence
presented
to
the
interstate
commission,
that
commission
made
a
report,
finding
an
out-of-pocket
loss
of
$306,000
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
--
and
entered
increase
fares
of
$383,000
which
was
the
commission
report
said
but
eliminate
the
out-of-pocket
deficit
and
result
in
a
contribution
to
indirect
cost
and
taxes
of
approximately
$77,000
annually.
the
interstate
report
then
comment
that
the
freight
operations
of
the
railroad
both
intra
and
interstate
for
a
$37
million
income
on
the
passenger
service,
both
intra
and
interstate,
suffer
a
deficit
of
$22,800,000
resulting
in
an
overall
net
railroad
income
of
$14,500,000.
the
report
then
states
to
the
extent
that
this
suburban
service
fails
to
meet
the
out-of-pocket
cost
and
make
all
the
contribution
that
it
reasonably
can
in
the
respondent's
indirect
cost.
it
increases
respondent's
passenger
deficit
and
results
in
an
undue
burden
upon
its
freight
operations,
state
and
interstate.
even
here,
the
report
does
not
claim
any
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
only
that
such
deficit
puts
a
burden
on
both
state
and
interstate
freight
operation.
this
is
not
a
person
and
localities
discrimination
nor
is
it
a
case
where
section
13
(4)
is
being
employed
to
raise
intrastate
rates
through
a
previously
decided
interstate
level.
they
have
not
gone
to
the
interstate
commission
and
have
--
and
have
received
interstate
rate
which
they
then
came
to
the
illinois
commission
and
asked
the
illinois
commission
to
match.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case.
instead,
this
is
a
case
where
the
interstate
commission
exerts
authority
to
raise
one
set
of
--
of
intrastate
rate.
the
suburban
fares
in
the
chicago
area
upon
a
single
factual
finding
at
the
suburban
rate,
upon
the
interstate
commission's
determination
of
out-of-pocket
cost
results
in
non-compensatory
rate
not
being
a
person
and
locality
discrimination,
the
only
justification
for
the
interstate's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
over
this
purely
intrastate
rate,
it's
upon
the
ground
of
a
revenue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
this
court
has
repeatedly
laid
down
the
doctrine
that
in
order
to
show
a
revenue
discrimination,
the
interstate
commission
must
find
that
the
intrastate
rates
fail
to
pay
their
fair
proportionate
share
of
the
revenue
to
the
carrier.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
they
call
that
out
of
thin
air,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
there
is
no
evidence
--
the
ultimate
finding,
the
ultimate
finding
of
the
commission
is
that
these
rates
are
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce.
there
are
no
subsidiary
findings,
no
factual
subsidiary
findings
or
statements
which
will
give
credence
to
that
conclusory
statement.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
might
be,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
the
report
has
to
stand
on
its
own
merit
by
the
findings.
i
don't
think
this
court
is
called
upon
to
examine
the
evidence
if
the
finding,
the
findings
themselves
do
not
support
the
order.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
--
it
requires
all
of
the
subsidiary
statements
as
well
as
the
ultimate
four
or
five
findings
that
the
commission
puts
at
the
end
of
its
order.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
sure.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
i
may
go
on,
in
this
court,
in
the
north
carolina
case
in
325
united
states,
states
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
they
must
show
that
that
drain
is
no
--
as
--
is
no
greater
or
is
greater,
i
might
say,
is
greater,
than
the
drain
of
the
other
service.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
show
a
discrimination
there
has
to
be
some
comparative
analysis
made
to
show
that
there
is
an
actual
discrimination.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
i
don't
quite
follow
your
question,
your
honor,
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
if
they
would
carry
--
if
they
carry
wheat
more
than
what
wheat
--
the
total
cost
of
service
of
wheat
on
an
intrastate
basis,
i
do
not
think
that
one
fact
alone
would
justify
interstate
commerce
commission
setting
aside
the
intrastate
rate
on
wheat.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
well,
in
fact,
at
least
if
they
have
to
show
that
that
item
which
they
are
carrying
in
a
lot
constitutes
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
i
--
i
will,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
i
--
i
shall,
i'd
be
very
happy
to.
as
i've
said
in
the
north
carolina
case,
this
court
stated,
the
commission
made
no
findings
as
to
what
intra
--
contribution
from
intrastate
traffic
would
constitute
a
fair
proportion
of
the
railroad's
total
income.
nothing
in
the
later
case
of
king
versus
united
states
altered
or
modified
the
requirement
that
there
must
be
a
finding
that
the
intrastate
rates
fail
to
pay
their
fair
proportionate
share.
in
the
report
of
the
interstate
commission
which
is
before
the
court
in
the
instant
case,
there
is
not
one
word
concerning
the
railroad's
revenues
other
than
suburban
revenues,
and
no
finding
or
subsidiary
statement
regarding
the
contribution
that
the
suburban
service
should
make
as
its
fair
proportionate
share
to
the
railroad's
income.
the
report
states
that
the
passenger
service
has
a
large
deficit
of
approximately
$23
million
while
the
freight
service
has
a
substantial
profit.
the
finding
is
that
the
suburban
service
provides
revenue
of
$1,800,000.
so
far,
as
the
report
itself
shows,
the
interstate
passengers
could
have
been
transported
for
nothing
while
the
intrastate
suburban
passengers
contributed
a
$1,800,000
to
the
total
revenues
of
the
milwaukee
railroad.
however,
we
know
that
there
is
no
such
ridiculous
situation
as
that.
while
the
interstate
commission's
report
does
not
mention,
the
1954
annual
report
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
the
railroad
was
stipulated
to
be
in
the
evidence.
and
that
report
shows
that
the
total
passenger
revenue
was
$14,906,000
while
the
passenger
deficit
was
$22,800,000.
now,
we
believe
that
the
words
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
mean
something
and
mean
what
they
say.
in
other
words,
discrimination
is
a
difference
of
treatment,
an
unjust
or
an
unequal
distinction.
some
comparative
analysis
must
be
drawn
to
demonstrate
the
discrimination.
an
analysis
based
upon
facts
of
the
record
and
not
a
mere
conclusory
statement
that
there
was
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
now,
keeping
in
mind
the
figures
which
the
report
shows,
we
have
first
a
suburban
deficit
of
$306,000
as
found
by
the
commission
against
a
suburban
revenue
of
$1,800,000
considerable
more
revenue
than
deficit,
while
the
total
passenger
revenue
of
$14,916,000
is
considerably
less
than
the
passenger
deficit
of
$22,800,000.
now,
even
if
you
take
the
so-called
fully
distributed
passenger
suburban
deficit
by
adding
an
extra
million
dollars
to
the
$130
--
to
the
$306,000
out-of-pocket
cost,
we
still
have
more
revenue
than
deficit
in
the
intrastate
service
while
we
have
just
the
opposite
in
the
interstate
service.
if
there
is
discrimination,
it
would
be
that
the
discrimination
is
against
the
suburban
service
and
not
against
the
interstate.
you
might
look
at
it
in
another
way.
the
suburban
revenues
of
$1,800,000
is
12%
of
the
total
passenger
revenues
while
the
suburban
deficit,
even
on
a
fully
distributed
faces
of
a
hundred
--
of
$1,300,000
is
only
6%
of
a
passenger
deficit.
while
we
believe
that
the
interstate's
report
itself
must
contain
the
basic
findings
as
to
the
intrastate
fair
proportionate
share,
actual
findings
of
fact
which
tend
to
show
a
failure
to
sustain
such
a
proportional
burden
and
in
the
absence
of
any
such
finding,
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
at
the
evidence.
yet,
there
are
other
facts
from
the
evidence
itself
which
tend
to
even
more
dispel
any
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
the
annual
report
of
the
railroad
which
was
stipulated
in
the
evidence
shows
that
while
the
passengers
carried
other
than
commutation
or
suburban
passenger,
fell
from
$7,500,000
in
1945
to
$3
million
in
1954.
and
the
revenue
fell
from
$36
million
in
1945
to
$13,500,000.
this
is
other
than
commutation
in
1954.
the
commutations
are
suburban
business
increase
substantially
in
both
total
passengers
and
in
revenue.
nor
do
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
freight
service
has
any
bearing
upon
a
comparison
to
determine
a
discrimination
by
the
passenger
suburban
service
against
interstate
commerce.
that
would
be
almost
like
comparing
bananas
with
bicycle.
there
is
no
showing
at
all
what
the
intrastate
freight
revenues
or
expenses
amount
to
or
what
the
intrastate
freight
contributes
as
to
the
total
net
earnings.
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
stated
in
the
report,
the
$306,000
suburban
deficit
amounts
to
less
than
a
1%
drag
on
the
$37
million
net
earnings
of
the
freight
service.
if
the
intrastate
freight
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
the
statute,
mr.
justice,
says
undue
and
unreasonable
discrimination.
we
think
that
there
must
be
something
in
the
meaning
of
an
undue
and
unreasonable
discrimination.
i
don't
think
that
it
says
suppliantly
just
a
discrimination
maybe
of
a
slight
drag
might
contribute
some.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
surely.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
well,
that's
the
one
--
that's
the
interstate
commission's
position.
in
other
words,
if
they
say
that
they
have
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
--
the
right
to
go
into
that
and
we
say
that
that
is
the
--
it's
an
intrastate
matter
which
the
state
commission
should
be
the
exclusive
one
to
fix
it.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
well,
your
honor,
the
wisconsin
commission
case
put
it
on
the
basis
of
a
fair
contribution
to
the
railroad
revenues
and
did
not,
i
think,
in
any
way
up
--
upturn
the
florida
case
which
came
many,
many
years
after
and
which
said
that
a
mere
non-compensatory
rate
does
not
justify
a
section
13
(4)
proceeding
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
is
--
that
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
statute
requires
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
not
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
surely.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
your
honor,
i
am
afraid
that
--
i
cannot
agree
that
that
is
the
interpretation
to
be
given
to
section
13
(4).
i
think
that
it
stops
before
then.
i
think
there
has
to
be
more
than
just
a
mere
non-compensatory
rate
and
the
ability
to
increase
that
rate.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that's
correct
to
that
extent
--
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
is
right.
that
is
merely
the
starting
point
to
see
if
there
is
discrimination.
the
mere
fact
of
depletion
is
not
in
our
opinion,
justify
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
exercise
as
--
its
extraordinary
jurisdiction
to
take
over
the
intrastate
fare.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
well,
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that's
right.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that's
correct.
you
wouldn't
--
i
--
in
my
opinion
you
wouldn't
have
a
case
of
discrimination.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
i
beg
your
pardon?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
yes,
yes,
we
do.
i
--
as
i
recall
we
do.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
the
--
i
might
say
that
in
that,
this
court
has
held
in
the
baltimore
&
ohio
versus
united
states
case
that
even
an
interstate
rate
which
was
non-compensatory
did
not
justify
upsetting
that
rate.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
well,
all
right.
all
right,
your
honor.
i
will
be
--
i
will
stand
corrected,
may
not
upset
the
rate.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
we
respectfully
submit
here,
your
honor
there
aren't
any
reasonable
basis
of
comparison.
there
is
no
showing
of
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
in
the
report
and
order
of
the
commission.
certainly,
there
is
no
showing
of
undue
or
unreasonable
discrimination.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
i
mean
that
there
must
be
some
comparative
analysis
in
order
to
show
a
real
substantial
as
--
as
chief
justice
taft
said
in
the
wisconsin
commission
case,
c,
b
&
q
case
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial,
a
real
substantial
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
harry
r.
begley
that
--
that's
right.
and
at
that
particular
time,
your
honor,
that
case
was
decided
under
the
1920,
section
15
(a)
national
transportation
policy
which
required
the
courts
and
the
interstate
commission
to
consider
the
railroads
both
interstate
and
intrastate
to
have
a
six
and
a
half
--

also,
in

there
has
not

any

of

normally,
even
in
a
discrimination
case.
there
is
a
rate
disparity
between
the
interstate
and
the
intrastate
rate
which
is
attempted
to
be
used
as
a
justification
for
this
revenue
discrimination.
here,
however,
we
find
that
the
intrastate
rate
set
by
the
interstate
commission
is
higher
than
the
interstate.
the
report
itself
showed
that
the
one-way
coach
fares
intrastate
are
fixed
at
3
cents
per
mile
with
a
minimum
of
25
cents
whereas
the
interstate
fares
are
on
the
basis
of
two
and
a
half
cents
per
mile
with
a
15-cent
minimum.
therefore,
in
the
absence
of
any,
in
our
opinion,
rate

are
factual
discrimination.
the
report
must
be
looked
at
for
what
it
actually
is.

determination

to
them
and
upon
the
allocation
of

as
they
determine

the

service
operates
at
a
loss.
that,
to
us,
is
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case.
can
the
interstate
commerce
commission
exercise
jurisdiction
over
an
intrastate
rate
simply
because
they
find
it
non-compensatory.
in
florida
versus
united
state,
282
u.s.,
chief
justice
hughes
answered
that
question
specifically
in
the
negative.
he
stated,
"but
to
justify
the
commission
in
the
alteration
of
intrastate
rates,
it
was
not
enough
for
the
commission
to
find
that
the
existing
intrastate
rates
on
a
particular
traffic
were
not
enumerative
or
reasonably
compensatory.
the
authority
to
determine
the
reasonableness
per
se
of
intrastate
rates
lay
with
the
state
authorities
and
not
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
any
departure
from
that
decision
would
change
section
13
(4)
requiring
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
into
a
straight
section

(1)
rate
proceeding
based
upon
a
mere
cost

service.
and
at
the
same
time
would,
for
all
practical
purposes,
repeal
by
implication
the
reservation
in
section
1
which
preserves
the
right
of
the
several
states
to
regulate
intrastate
commerce.
i
think
at
this
point,
the
language
of
this
court
in
palmer
versus
massachusetts
in
308
u.s.
which
we
didn't
cite
in
our
brief
but
which
was
a
question
of
the
bankruptcies
court
power
over
intra
--
over
the
railroad
station
closing.
but
it
spoke
about
the
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
federal
jurisdiction.
this
court
stated,
"at
best
this
is
subtle
business
calling
for
great
wariness
less
--
what
professes
to
be
mere
rendering,
becomes
creation
and
attempted
interpretation
of
legislation
becomes
legislation
itself.
especially
if
wariness
enjoined
when
the
problem
of
construction
implicates
one
of
the
recurring
faces
of
our
federalism
and
thus
striking
a
balance
between
national
and
state
authority
in
one
of
the
most
sensitive
areas
of
government.”
therefore,
a
construing
legislation,
this
court
has
disfavored
inroads
by
implication
on
state
authority
and
recently
confined
restrictions
upon
the
traditional
power
of
states
to
regulate
their
local
transportation
to
the
plain
mandate
of
congress.
the
plain
mandate
of
congress
in
section
13
(4)
is
removal
of
undue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
as
it
was
stated
in
the
very
first
case,
in
the
wisconsin
commission
case,
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
should
be
directed
to
substantial
disparity
which
operates
as
a
real
discrimination
against
an
obstruction
to
interstate
commerce.
in
the
north
carolina
case,
this
court
specifically
said
neither
section
13
(4)
nor
any
other
congressional
legislation
indicates
a
purpose
to
attempt
wholly
to
deprive
the
states
of
their
primary
authority
to
regulate
interstate
--
intrastate
rate.
a
scrupulous
regard
for
maintaining
the
power
of
the
state
in
this
field
has
caused
this
court
to
require
that
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
giving
precedents
to
federal
right
must
meet
a
high
standard
of
certainty.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case
does
not
meet
that
high
degree
of
certainty
which
shows
that
there
is
a
real
discrimination
against
our
obstruction
to
interstate
commerce
on
the
record
here.
while
a
state
should
not
be
enjoined
--
should
not
enjoy
the
earnings
from
interstate
commerce
to
support
intrastate
commerce,
the
state
should
only
be
called
upon
to
furnish
compensation
for
the
intrastate
business,
reasonably
proportionate
to
that
for
the
interstate
business.
if
proportionate
contribution
in
relation
to
interstate,
our
total
income
is
not
necessary,
then
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate
becomes
the
ability
to
pay
and
the
value
of
the
service
becomes
what
the
traffic
will
bear
instead
of
an
effort
to
remove
a
real
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
if
the
national
transportation
policy
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
to
be
that
all
intrastate
rates
must
be
compensatory
then
congress
should
amend
that
act.
legislative
usurpation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
along
that
line
should
not
be
tolerated
or
sanctioned
by
this
court.
the
state
commission,
i
can
assure
you,
are
fully
aware
of
the
need
for
an
efficient,
strong,
and
adequate
transportation
system.
mass
transportation
which
is
involved
in
this
suburban
fare
cases
is
important
to
the
national
interest.
the
problems
of
traffic
congestion
and
the
large
loss
of
life
in
traffic
accidents
which
exist
in
peacetime
and
the
need
to
move
people
to
and
from
work,
in
wartime
with
gas
rationing
require
in
the
public
interest
the
promotion
and
continuance
of
adequate
mass
transportation
service
at
reasonable
rates.
exacting
some
subsidy,
even
if
we
assume
that
the
service
operates
at
a
loss
from
the
freight
service
for
mass
commuters
service
is
justifiable
as
requiring
the
freight
service
to
support
interstate
passenger
service.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
not
the
only
expert
body
which
is
capable
of
exercising
an
informed
judgment.
there
is
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on,
on
behalf
of
the
state
and
that
is
the
lower
court
held
that
if
different
evidence
is
to
be
offered
or
a
different
basis
is
to
be
urged
before
the
interstate
commission,
the
state
commission
should
have
been
given
a
chance
to
fix
rates
on
the
same
evidence
in
the
same
basis.
i
see
the
time
--
the
factual
--
mr.
harry
r.
begley
all
right,
fine.
the
factual
situation
in
this
place
clearly
supports
this
proposition.
as
we
have
pointed
out,
there
is
no
real
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
but
merely
a
claim
non-compensatory
intrastate
rate.
if
a
railroad
can
come
before
the
state
commission
and
put
in
a
case
which
fails
to
show
any
loss
and
then
go
to
the
interstate
commission
and
put
in
a
different
case
on
expenditure
which
may
show
an
actual
loss,
with
the
interstate
commission
making
a
report
which
gives
the
state
commission
30
days
to
adopt
the
interstate
finding
or
else
be
hit
with
a
section
4
--
13
(4)
affirmative
order
then
all
semblance
of
state
authority
over
inter
--
intrastate
rates
disappear.
the
clear
reservation
of
state
power
over
intrastate
rates
found
in
section
1
becomes
a
nullity
and
the
state
commission
is
not
even
a
way
station
in
the
journey
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
the
lower
court
said
but
is
reduced
to
a
mere
bulletin
board
for
the
posting
of
the
interstate

commission
order.
thank
you.
