mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
if
the
court
please.
before
passing
on
to
what
i
think,
possibly,
more
important
part
of
the
case,
i
might
--
i
might
say
something
as
to
what
was
said
about
the
interstate
rate.
the
only
interstate
rate
involved
in
this
case
were
rates
to
walworth
and
zenda,
wisconsin
which
were
the
tail
end
of
the
west
suburban
--
of
the
north
suburban
line
of
the
milwaukee
road
out
of
chicago.
the
--
there
was
no
independent
evidence
of
any
kind
as
to
the
interstate
rate
to
zenda
and
walworth.
the
rates
were
fixed
on
that
line
to
correspond
with
the
intervening
intrastate
rates
as
fixed.
there
was
no
special
attention
directed
to
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
one
train,
it
goes
out
through
them.
one
suburban
train
needs
to
--
goes
out,
one
comes
in.
that's
all
the
service
they
have
each
day.
the
complaint
interstate
--
the
illinois
commerce
commission
which
joined
in
the
complaint
and
of
course
is
interested
primarily
in
interstate
rates
and
the
petition
was
based
on
section
13
(4)
directed
intrastate
rates.
they
prepared
the
complaint
for
the
rate,
the
entire
order
will
be
set
aside.
obviously,
if
the
intrastate
rates
--
the
order
as
to
intrastate
rate
is
set
aside,
there's
nothing
for
the
order
to
the
two
little
wisconsin
villages
to
stand
on.
there
--
there's
a
--
if
--
if
the
court,
the
district
court
couldn't
set
aside,
the
order
is
to
--
as
to
intrastate
rates,
they
say
the
order
shall
remain
in
effect
as
standard
state
rates.
compared
that
to
the
interstate
rate,
the
interstate
rates
necessarily
fall
and
follows
at
a
district
court
an
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
order
into
the
whole
order.
any
other
decree
wouldn't
have
any
consistency
or
any
common
sense
in
it.
the
--
that's
their
--
a
very
minor
part
of
this
case
that
i
thought
i
would
say
that
at
the
start
of
my
argument.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
what's
that?
excuse
me,
justice.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
the
intrastate
order
stands
and
the
interstate
order
rather
stand.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
if
the
intrastate
order
stand
and
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
yes,
certainly.
the
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
the
--
the
case
involves
a
13
(4)
case
and
they
just
--
they're
just
the
tail
end
and
it
deserve
no
separate
consideration
and
the
district
court
would
have
been
--
well,
they
would
have
been
idiotic
for
the
district
court
to
give
them
any
separate
consideration
on
the
record
before
it.
there
was
nothing
--
nothing
we
had
read
about
them.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
excuse
me.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
i
could
say
that
consistency
and
common
sense
would
require
it,
yes.
there
was
no
separate
evidence.
the
intra
--
there
was
nothing
--
no,
no
separate
consideration
to
the
interstate
rates.
they
were
fixed.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
they
were
fixed
to
--
to
conform
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
the
power
is
different.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
the
power
is
different
but
the
district
court
reviewed
the
entire
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
if
the
--
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
--
that
the
intrastate
rate
shouldn't
be
fixed
in
the
--
necessarily,
the
interstate
rates,
mr.
justice
black,
that
depend
on
it
have
nothing
to
stand
on.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
not
necessarily
but
in
this
particular
case,
all
the
findings
have
to
do
with
the
intrastate
rates
and
the
interstate
rates
are
fixed
to
correspond
and
said
so.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
well,
it
is
in
our
brief.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
well,
it
is
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
the
--
the
only
ground
upon
which
the
interstate
rates
were
fixed
at
all
was
to
be
--
to
correspond
with
the
intrastate
rates.
and
they
said
the
intrastate
--
it
says
in
the
--
the
interstate
rate
should
be
raised
accordingly.
now,
if
you
take
off
the
intrastate
rates,
what
is
left
for
the
interstate
rates
to
depend
upon,
are
you
going
to
have
a
different
rate
of
fare
to
zenda
than
you
are
to
the
--
to
the
next
station
inside
which
is
in
illinois.
i
would
think
that
would
follow
and
i
--
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
--
that's
what
i
think
here.
now,
i
believe
that
i
will
say
a
little
more
on
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
--
conflicting
jurisdictions
if
you
please,
or
coordinate
jurisdictions
of
the
state
and
the
federal
commission
over
intrastate
rates.
the
--
there's
no
question
--
it
has
never
been
questioned
by
the
courts
and
i
might
refer
to
the
north
carolina
case,
stating
it
very
well,
as
to
the
paramount
authority
of
the
interstate
--
of
the
state
commission
--
state
authorities,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
don't
care
to
get
the
commission
in
yet,
the
state
authority
over
intrastate
rates.
the
statute
where
the
state
commission
gets
its
authority
is
the
state
statute
and
of
course
it's
different
in
the
federal
statute.
but
when
it
comes
to
fixing
rates,
when
you'll
--
adequate
revenue,
intrastate
rates,
the
paramount
authority
is
in
the
state
commission.
and
sections
13
(4)
--
13
(3)
and
13
(4)
--
13
(3),
refers
to
--
whenever
at
any
investigation
under
the
provisions
of
this
part
and
so
forth,
there
--
shall
brought
an
issue,
any
rate,
fare,
charge,
classification,
regulation
or
practice,
made
or
imposed
by
authority
of
any
state
--
in
the
next
--
made
or
imposed
by
authority
of
any
state.
and
then
in
the
next
section,
13
(4)
it
says,
whenever
in
any
such
investigation,
the
commission
after
a
full
hearing
finds
that
such
rate,
fare,
charge,
classification
or
regulation,
using
the
same
words,
passing
down
a
little,
results
in
any
undue,
unreasonable
or
unjust
discrimination
against
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
then
the
interstate
commission
can
remedy
the
--
the
discrimination.
but
it
does
have
to
be
a
rate
fixed
by
the
state
which
causes
undue,
unjust,
and
unreasonable
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
always
that
it
has
to
be
fixed
by
a
state
commission.
for
example,
in
my
own
state
in
illinois,
the
carrier
post
a
rate
and
if
the
commission
--
neither
the
commission
nor
anyone
interested
objects
to
that
rate,
goes
into
effect.
and
that's
a
rate
by
--
fixed
by
state
authority
under
the
state
law.and
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
you
could
file
a
petition
in
the
--
under
section
13
(4)
in
the
--
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
remove
a
discrimination
if
there
was
a
discrimination
caused
by
such
rate.
there
was
the
case
in
the
florida
state
--
in
the
florida
case.
that
was
a
court
--
was
careful
to
find
that
the
rate
there
had
been
fixed
by
state
authority
although
there
has
been
no
hearing
before
the
commission.
it
was
a
case
where
the
--
under
the
state
law,
the
rates
became
effective
without
a
hearing
as
it
does
in
most
states
where
no
hearing
is
demanded.
but
that
isn't
the
case
we
have
in
front
of
us.
in
the
case
here,
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
interstate
--
the
illinois
commerce
commission.
and
where
a
hearing
is
demanded
under
the
illinois
law,
there
can
be
no
rate
fixed
by
state
authority
under
section
13
(3)
until
that
hearing
has
had.
we
don't
have
to
take
a
hypothetical
case
where
a
rate
is
fixed
by
state
authority
without
a
hearing
before
the
commission.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
commission.
furthermore,
the
action
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
brought
by
the
milwaukee
road.
it
wasn't
an
independent
investigation.
it
wasn't
brought
on
behalf
of
the
public
or
some
suffering
shipper,
it
was
filed
by
the
milwaukee
road
for
--
for
increased
rates
and
the
basis
of
the
--
the
--
the
cause
of
action,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
as
stated
in
the
petition
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
that
the
illinois
commission
had
acted
unfairly.
the
milwaukee
road
sets
up
and
it
filed
a
petition
in
1952
and
that
after
extensive
hearings,
for
--
extending
for
a
year
or
more,
the
illinois
commission
after
holding
it
under
advisement
for
a
considerable
period,
denied
it.
they
denied
the
increase.
now,
the
case
is
this
--
expressly
based
on
a
contention
that
the
illinois
commission,
which
admittedly
has
primary
jurisdiction
over
interstate
rate
had
acted
unfairly
in
fixing
those
rates.
now
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
i
want
to
make
--
give
you
a
fair
answer
and
i'll
try.
if
there
has
been
a
real
fixing
of
the
rate
by
state
authority,
fairly
fixed
and
that
causes
--
fairly
presented,
i'm
--
i
mean,
net
causes,
undue,
unjust
or
unreasonable
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
i
think
the
interstate
commission
can
act
under
section
13
(4).
but
it
must
be
a
rate
fixed
by
state
authority
and
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
when
you
say
a
rate
fixed
by
state
authority,
you
must
mean
a
rate
fixed
by
state
authority
on
the
basis
--
on
the
same
accounting
theory
upon
which
they
asked
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
fix
the
rate.
otherwise,
the
proceeding
before
the
--
before
the
state
becomes
a
farce.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
yes.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
that's
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
we
are
--
i'm
with
--
with
certainty,
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
well,
i
would
like
--
well,
i'll
answer
first
and
then
i'll
--
i'll
put
--
read
--
put
in
further
what
i
was
going
to
refer
to.
i
believe
that
when
you
say
that
a
rate
is
fixed
by
state
authority,
and
in
this
case,
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
state
authority
was
the
commission.
so
we
don't
have
to
say
what
it
has
to
be
nor
what
it
was.
in
this
case
the
only
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
oh,
yes.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
yes.
and
--
and
if
the
--
the
commission
or
anybody
else
questions
it
then
there's
a
hearing
and
there
were
extensive
hearings
here.
and
by
the
way,
just
exactly
as
a
result
of
those
hearings
the
milwaukee
road
dieselized
its
suburban
service
as
a
saving.
well,
we
quarrel
as
to
what
it
was.
they
--
they
say
it
was
800
and
something
and
we
say
it
was
in
approximate
--
under
--
(inaudible)
it
was
a
million.
anyway,
it
is
a
very
large
saving
to
a
great
advantage
of
the
railroad
and
the
traveling
public.
and
as
they
know
very
well
that
the
interim,
before
the
decision
was
while
they
were
putting
in
effect
that
dieselization,
the
president
of
the
road
in
his
testimony
--
at
the
opening
of
the
case
said
they
had
--
had
no
diesels
in
their
suburban
service
nor
did
they
intend
to
put
any
on.
so
that
they
--
and
that
was
a
testimony
on
july
24
--
no,
that
was
the
testimony
in
the
1950
--
the
first
hearing
in
1952.
i
think
its
october.
the
--
so
the
--
the
state
--
the
supervision
of
these
things
by
the
state
is
very,
very
useful.
they're
very
close
to
it.
and
it's
--
it's
a
jurisdiction
that
should
be
jealously
protected.
i
don't
mean
that
--
that
if
they
put
a
rate
in
and
it's
manifestly
unfair
that
it
should
stand.
but
i
say
that
they
must
be
allowed
to
proceed
--
they
must
have
a
fair
chance
to
fix
their
rate
on
--
on
the
theory
of
accounting
that
is
presented
to
the
--
to
the
commission.
i'm
going
to
read
a
little
from
the
district
court's
opinion
because
i
think
it's
pretty
good.
first,
i'm
going
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
and
i
think
it's
already
been
called
attention
to
that
in
the
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
--
as
your
honors
said,
at
least
it
gave
a
slap
on
the
wrist
to
the
railroad
for
not
having
it
--
presented
it,
of
the
$306,000
deficit
out-of-pocket,
i
should
say,
deficit,
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
found,
$260,000
is
in
the
items
that
were
not
presented
to
the
illinois
commission.
and
to
make
certain
other
adjustments
which
i
shan't
go
into
because
i
haven't
time,
they're
in
the
brief.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
deficit
but
that's
a
--
that's
a
question
of
--
some
question
of
--
of
a
quarrel
about
accounting
theories.
but
the
district
court
said,
after
quoting
from
the
north
carolina
case,
showing
that
the
state
has
paramount
authority
over
intrastate
rates
and
that
authority
must
be
jealously
guarded,
i'm
paraphrasing
which
words
to
that
effect,
the
district
court
said,
"where
a
railroad
seeks
the
fixing
of
higher
intrastate
rates
by
the
interstate
commission
after
failing
in
such
endeavor
before
a
state
commission,
section
13
(4)
does
not
contemplate
that
the
state
commission
is
to
be
considered
only
as
a
way
station
in
a
journey
to
the
interstate
commission."
in
the
instant
case,
justification
of
the
exercise
of
the
federal
power
to
nullify
state
rates
does
not
purely
appear
from
the
record
before
us.and
as
you
will
remember
in
the
north
carolina
case,
it
said
it
had
to
--
it
--
that
it
had
to
appear
clearly
and
--
and
with
a
cert
--
with
certainty
and
clarity
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
should
intervene.
and
i'm
going
to
put
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
not
unless
it
had
some
rate
that
was
approved
by
state
authority
to
which
it
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
but
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
prior
--
there
was
a
prior
rate.
it's
possible
if
they
could.
i
would
--
i'm
--
i
have
to
answer
your
question
this
way.
there
was
an
unreasonable
interval
between
the
posting
of
their
other
rate
in
the
present
day
--
i
think
they
will
have
to
go
to
the
state
commission
first.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
well,
silence
isn't
--
is
--
is
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
--
is
an
approval.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
yes.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
yes.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
there
must
be
a
rate
prescribed
by
state
authority.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
if
the
rate
had
been
fixed
within
a
reasonable
time,
prior
time
they
went,
i
don't
think
they
could
get
a
rate
that's
15
years
old
and
go
to
the
commerce
commission
without
first
forcing
them
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
well,
i
believe
that
the
law
is
a
science,
i
have
--
as
i
have
been
told,
science
of
reason
as
well
as
logic.
and
that
if
an
unreasonable
time
has
elapsed
since
the
state
posted
a
rate
that
they'd
have
to
post
a
new
one.
but
then
again
i
say,
your
honors,
the
question
is
really
not
involved
because
they
did
go
to
the
congress.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
yes.
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
now,
the
--
actually,
they
did
get
a
raise
in
1951
to
--
just
before
they
filed
this
1952
petition.
they
got
a
raise,
substantially
what
they
asked.
so
it
isn't
--
so
that
i
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
they
have
been
entirely
mistreated.
the
--
now,
if
the
court
please,
just
a
word
on
the
question
of
the
evidence
of
discrimination,
this
--
the
interstate
commission
does
not
have
authority
to
fix
an
intrastate
rate
merely
on
the
fact
that
it
is
not
compensatory
or
does
not
yield
sufficient
revenue.
that's
what
the
state
commission
does.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
the
--
they
can't
be
fixed
on
that
way
but
the
state
--
the
state
commission
is
the
--
is
the
place
to
fix
that
kind
of
a
rate
in
the
absence
of
discrimination.
congress
has
elected
to
say
there
has
to
be
discrimination.
that's
what
it
says
in
the
statute.
and
i
suppose
discrimination
must
be
taken
in
its
ordinary
english
sense
and
i
think
i'll
risk
referring
to
the
definition
in
webster's
dictionary
was
used
in
this
sense,
discrimination,
"a
distinction,
as
in
treatment,
especially
an
unfair
or
injurious
distinction
specifically
arbitrary
imposition
of
unequal
tariffs
for
substantially
the
same
service.
a
difference
in
treatment
made
between
persons,
localities
or
classes
of
traffic
in
respect
to
substantially
the
same
service".
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
of
--
of
discrimination
of
a
different
treatment
of
the
interstate
traffic
and
service
from
what
--
on
what
is
given
to
interstate
traffic
and
service.
the
--
in
the
burlington
case,
c,
b
&
q
case,
wisconsin
against
c,
b
&
q
has
been
referred
to
which
--
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
is
the
initial
case
under
section
13
(4).
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
section
15
(a)
which
had
been
enacted
also
in
1920
but
somewhat
amended
since,
which
ensures
to
railroads
an
adequate
return
does
not
apply
to
intrastate
traffic.
it
does
say
there's
a
dovetail
relationship.
and
this
is
what
the
dovetail
relationship
was.
there
--
as
i
said,
if
--
if
there
is
inequality
between
disparity,
is
the
word
they
used,
disparity
between
the
interstate
and
in
--
and
intrastate
rates
that
--
that
the
interstate
commission
can
make
up
that
disparity.
and
in
that
particular
case,
there
has
been
a
raise
in
interstate
rates
and
the
decision
was
that
the
in
--
intrastate
rates
could
be
raised
accordingly.
the
--
there
is
--
there's
no
--
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
mere
insufficiency
of
revenue
to
meet
expense
gives
the
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction.
that's
just
the
jurisdiction
of
the
inter
--
of
the
--
that
the
illinois
commission
has
--
that
the
state
commission
has.
that's
why
they
--
when
you
say
they
have
paramount
authority,
that's
what
you
mean.
if
they
have
authority
to
consider
whether
the
rate
is
sufficiently
compensatory
to
the
railroad
and
--
and
the
--
i
was
anxious
and
under
our
law,
they're
required
to
fix
so
there
should
be
a
fair
return.
the
--
if
congress
thinks
that
there
--
there
should
be
more
supervision
and
if
they
can
do
it
within
the
constitution,
they
could
pass
another
act.
but
i
was
talking
about
the
act
we
have.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case,
and
no
finding
as
--
as
to
what
would
be
a
fair
proportionate
revenue
contribution.
and
the
illinois
central
case
has
been
referred
to.
well,
in
that
case,
they
found
the
value
of
the
property
in
--
in
the
suburb
--
in
the
suburban
service,
the
value
of
the
property
in
the
other
service,
the
ratio
of
the
return
from
one
and
the
ratio
of
the
return
to
other
in
order
to
--
to
determine
whether
the
rates
they
fixed
for
suburban
service
were
sufficient.
and
by
the
way,
in
the
--
in
the
first
illinois
central
case,
in
101
f.
2d.,
the
--
they
didn't
raise
the
round
trip
or
single
fare
--
fares
because
they
were
already
up
to
the
interstate
rates.
in
the
later
proceeding,
we
just
decided
last
march,
they
did
raise
them
but
in
that
--
it
was
joined
that
--
they
said
they
should
be
raised
but
they
entered
no
order
because
that
was
the
proceeding
which
the
illinois
commerce
commission
took
part
and
entered
the
order.
the
--
now,
the
case
is
not
decided
wholly
on
the
--
on
the
question
that
i
raised.
they're
very
important,
very
interesting
and
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
if
--
if
the
--
as
i
say,
if
the
--
if
the
states
are
really
--
if
it
mean
anything
when
they
say
the
state
court
--
the
commission
has
jurisdiction,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
100%
right
on
that
point
and
should
not
be
overturned.
and
i'm
--
i
base
that
on
--
as
i
say,
on
the
facts
not
on
a
theory
as
to
whether
they
could
have
gone
without
--
without
going
to
the
commission
but
they
went
to
them.
now,
that
--
i
mean,
it's
five
minutes,
i
guess.
the
--
mr.
s.
ashley
guthrie
the
court
--
the
district
court
found
that
the
rates
it
has
fixed,
i
don't
mean
the
district
court,
excuse
me.
the
commerce
commission
found
that
the
rates
it
has
fixed
were
just
and
reasonable.
that
--
just
and
reasonable
for
the
future.
that
finding,
the
district
court
held,
had
no
support
in
the
evidence.
the
only
support
for
it
as
appears
from
the
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
that
the
rates
it
has
fixed
for
the
same
as
those
of
the
north
western
railway.
we
have
in
our
brief,
set
forth
the
colloquy
where
the
witness
--
between
the
examiner
and
the
witness
about
the
north
western
and
the
net
result
of
it
is
that
he
said
--
have
too
much
pressure
that
there
was
a
similarity
in
the
--
in
the
suburban
areas
served.
actually,
the
north
western
rates
were
fixed
on
a
--
an
operation
of
72
steam
locomotives
and
only
3
diesel
locomotives.
whereas
the
--
milwaukee
has
--
was
entirely
--
is
entirely
dieselized.
the
--
there's
no
similarity
in
operation.
there's
never
--
no
foundation
for
the
findings
they're
just
and
reasonable.
thus,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
when
it
fixed
the
north
western
rates,
288
icc
115
said,
the
above
analysis,
that
is
the
analysis
on
which
the
commission's
order
was
based,
relates
to
an
existing
suburban
operation
for
the
year
1951.
it
obviously
doesn't
know
how
to
contemplate
the
cost
of
some
other
suburban
operation
that
it
might
be
encountered
with
diesel
engines,
gallery
type
cars
and
bud
cars.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
--
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
