mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
these
appeals
are
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
district
court
set
aside
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
prescribing
interstate
and
intrastate
fares
for
the
chicago
suburban
service
of
the
milwaukee
railroad.
the
commission's
order
prescribing
the
intrastate
fares
was
based
upon
a
finding
of
an
undue
revenue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
as
you
know,
section
13,
paragraphs
3
and
4
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
provides
among
other
things
that
if
in
an
investigation
of
any
intrastate
rate,
fare,
practice,
and
so
forth,
the
commission
finds
that
such
a
rate,
practice
or
fare
causes
an
undue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
it
shall
prescribe
the
fare,
rate
or
practice
which
will
remove
such
discrimination.
the
last
case
under
section
13
(4)
which
this
court
had
occasion
to
consider
at
oral
argument
was
king
versus
united
states
referred
to
in
the
brief.
as
you
will
recall,
in
that
case,
the
commission
had
raised
the
intrastate
freight
rates
in
florida
in
part
at
least
to
take
care
of
this
passenger
deficit
with
which
the
railroads
are
faced.
that
passenger
deficit
continues
today.
and
as
we
mentioned
in
the
brief,
the
commission
is
now
engaged
in
a
general
investigation
into
that
subject.
the
case
here
today
involves
one
phase
of
that
question.
in
the
record,
at
page
5,
is
a
map
showing
the
setting
of
our
case.
the
territory,
in
which
the
milwaukee
performs
its
suburban
service,
extends
over
its
west
line,
a
distance
of
37
miles
between
chicago
and
elgin,
illinois,
and
over
its
north
line,
a
distance
of
73
miles
between
chicago
and
walworth,
wisconsin.
there
are
only
two
intermediate
--
interstate
points
involved,
walworth
and
zenda,
wisconsin.
on
the
west
line,
the
railroad
performs
daily
during
the
work
week
or
i
should
say
operates
one
train
between
chicago
and
a
point
about
half
way
at
bensenville,
and
13
trains
between
chicago
and
elgin.
on
the
north
line,
it
operates
three
trains
daily
between
chicago
and
deerfield,
a
point
just
north
of
the
cook
county
line,
nine
trains
daily
and
this
is
in
both
directions
between
chicago
and
fox
lake,
up
in
the
lake
area
and
one
train
daily
between
chicago
and
walworth,
wisconsin.
on
the
weekends,
of
course,
the
service
is
reduced.
the
fares,
both
interstate
and
intrastate
for
this
suburban
service
were
before
the
commission's
orders
and
are
now
as
a
result
of
the
commission's
orders
on
the
same
level.
the
undisputed
fact
here
today
is
that
before
the
commission
issued
its
orders,
this
suburban
service
was
not
--
was
failing
by
$306,000
to
cover
its
out-of-pocket
cost
of
over
$2,200,000.
the
case
had
its
origin
in
1952
when
the
railroad
went
to
the
state
commission
requesting
permission
to
take
off
some
of
its
all
power
trains
to
consolidate
other
trains
and
to
then
to
raise
its
fares
by
amount
necessary
to
cover
the
out-of-pocket
cost.
its
case
there
for
an
increase
in
fares
was
based
primarily
upon
a
showing
of
insufficient
revenues
to
cover
the
cost
and
use
an
abbreviated
cost
study
to
prove
its
point
in
the
belief
that
it
could
clearly
show
that
this
out-of-pocket
cost
was
greater
than
the
revenues
it
was
getting
from
the
service.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no
--
no,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
was
none.
the
state
commission
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
there
is
a
showing
of
record
of
the
total
loss.
the
railroad
is
suffering
from
its
total
passenger
service.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
this
is
the
--
all
together,
the
figure
is
something
like
22
million,
i
think.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that's
--
that
i
can
answer,
sir.out
there
--
here
is
that
out-of-pocket
deficit
alone
plus
a
showing
that
increase
fares
will
produce
substantially
increase
in
revenues
mixed
to
the
case.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that's
quite
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that's
quite
true,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
well
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
i
think
so,
sir.
yes,
sir.
this
--
this
was
being
performed
at
an
out-of-pocket
loan.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that's
true,
too.
the
state
commission
was
of
the
view
that
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
during
a
state
proceeding
and
before
the
report
was
issued,
the
railroad
had
converted
to
a
diesel
operation
that
it
--
the
railroad
had
an
operation
in
which
it
was
recovering
substantially
more
revenues
than
the
expenses.
the
state
commission
then
denied
any
relief
whatsoever.
the
railroad
then
came
to
the
icc
alleging
that
under
--
under
its
diesel
operation,
the
existing
intrastate
suburban
fares
were
causing
an
undue
revenue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
the
railroad
requested
increases
in
its
suburban
fares,
intrastate
and
interstate,
averaging
about
29%.
although
the
railroad
introduced
evidence
such
as
rate
comparisons
and
cost
of
living
indexes,
each
case
was
bottomed
upon
a
showing
of
out-of-pocket
cost
exceeding
revenues.
the
cost
this
time
included
such
items
as
depreciation
and
maintenance
of
way
which
were
not
presented
to
the
state
commission.
the
carrier
also
included
at
these
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
record
show,
sir,
that
the
railroad
thought
that
it
was
clearly
a
showing
under
its
abbreviated
formula
cost
far
exceeding
the
revenues.
that's
the
reason
given
of
record.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
the
--
the
icc
mentioned
in
its
report
that
--
that
the
commission's
--
on
the
railroad's
excuse,
explained
their
failure
to
present
a
fully
developed
case
but
did
not
excuse
the
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
commission
said
that
--
that
the
railroad's
explanation
explained
why
it
had
not
gone
but
did
not
excused
the
railroad's
action
in
not
presenting
a
fully
--
a
full
cost
study
to
this
information.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir
and
that's
--
that's
my
main
--
one
of
my
first
point
that
--
that
the
point
--
the
scope
is
not
the
same.
they
have
different
statutes
and
--
and
the
previous
proceedings
are
conducted
for
different
purposes.
as
i
say,
the
carrier
in
the
icc
proceeding
also
introduced
in
assistance
of
the
examiner,
this
northwestern
point
--
scale
of
fares
for
its
suburban
service.
the
railroad
also
introduced
that
the
request
of
the
commission's
cost
finding
stay
up
on
the
additional
explanation
of
its
cost
study.
the
commission
in
this
report
found
that
these
suburban
--
the
suburban
service
was
causing
an
undue
revenue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
and
specified
the
increases
averaging
about
21%
which
in
this
judgment
was
needed
to
correct
the
discrimination.
it
also
authorized
increases
in
the
interstate
fares
and
those
fares
became
effective
in
january
1956.
now,
following
the
commission's
usual
practice,
it
did
not
then
and
there
prescribed
these
intrastate
fares
but
left
the
way
open
for
the
state
to
allow
them
to
go
into
effect.
when
the
state
failed
to
approve
the
increases,
the
commission
entered
its
order.
the
complaint
was
then
filed
in
the
lower
court
attacking
only
the
order
affecting
the
intrastate
fares.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
well,
that
was
--
that
was
about
the
only
action
it
could
have
taken
--
allow
them
to
go
into
effect.
the
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
it's
not
a
mandate
because
they
don't
have
to.
but
if
they
do
voluntarily
allow
these
rates
to
go
into
effect,
they
maintain
--
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
rate
structure.
and
frankly,
it's
much
better
for
the
state
commission
to
handle
these
local
matters
than
it
is
for
the
federal
commission.and
that's
the
reason
the
order
doesn't
issue
immediately.
we
present
four
questions
here.
the
united
states
joins
in
the
first
two.
they
are
these
-
whether
the
commission
was
wrong
in
considering
evidence
which
the
state
commission
have
not
considered.
(2)
whether
the
court
could
set
aside
the
order
approving
the
increases
in
the
interstate
fares.
then
the
third
question
is
whether
the
commission's
findings
are
sufficient
to
show
an
undue
revenue
discrimination.
and
the
fourth
question
is
whether
the
evidence
supports
the
finding
that
the
prescribed
fares
will
be
just
and
reasonable.
i
would
first
like
to
discuss
this
question
of
submitting
the
same
evidence
to
both
commissions.
the
court
below
held
in
effect
that
the
icc,
in
an
investigation
involving
an
intrastate
rate,
must
limit
its
consideration
to
the
evidence
introduced
in
a
prior
state
proceeding.
the
court
said,
"if
different
evidence
is
to
be
offered
or
a
different
basis
of
fares
is
to
be
urged
before
the
interstate
commission,
the
state
commission
should
have
been
given
a
chance
to
fix
fares
on
the
same
evidence
and
the
same
basis."
now,
while
the
court
there
is
specifically
referring
to
these
cost
items,
the
ruling
is
just
as
applicable
to
the
northwestern's
fares
which
were
put
in
at
--
upon
the
insistence
of
the
examiner
and
it
is
just
as
applicable
to
these
questions
which
the
commission's
cost
finding
staff
presented
to
the
railroad
in
which
the
railroad
answered
on
the
record.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
lower
court
didn't
say
that
but
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
--
but
that's
what
it
means,
sir.
that's
what
it
means.
we
become
a
reviewing
court
of
some
state
action.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
was
before
as
a
party.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
as
a
party.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
and
it
did.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
i
hear
counsel
say
--
saying
that's
not
so.
the
state
took
a
very
small
part
in
this
case.
the
case
on
the
other
side
was
developed
mainly
by
the
commuters'
association
but
there
is
a
witness
who
testified
in
this
case
and
he
was
appearing
for
the
state
commission.
he
was
employed
by
the
state
commission.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
state?
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
state
commission
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
it
was
a
party
before
the
commission.
there
are
several
reasons
while
--
why
the
ruling
of
the
lower
court
is
unsound
such
as
the
fact
that
the
two
proceedings
are
conducted
under
different
statutes
and
for
different
purposes.
and
the
fact
that
time,
the
time
element
alone
would
require
the
railroad
to
bring
this
case
up
to
date
in
the
later
icc
proceeding.
but
we
say
here
that
the
best
reason
is
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
first
florida
log
case.
that's
reported
at
282
united
states
report
and
it's
referring
to
in
the
brief.
in
that
case,
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
the
commission
could
prescribe
an
intrastate
rate
to
remove
an
undue
revenue
discrimination
where
there
hadn't
even
been
prior
state
proceeding.
in
that
case,
as
you
will
recall,
the
georgia
commission
came
to
the
icc
complaining
of
interstate
rates
on
logs
between
florida
and
georgia
and
that
the
intrastate
rate
on
logs
for
a
distance
up
to
170
miles
within
florida.
the
--
in
the
administrative
proceeding,
the
commission
found
that
both
rates
need
to
be
adjusted.
it
adjusted
the
interstate
rate
down
and
the
intrastate
rate
up.
the
in
--
the
florida
intrastate
rate
had
been
voluntarily
established
by
the
carrier
and
the
argument
was
made
that
since
the
rate
had
not
been
made
or
imposed
by
the
state,
within
the
wording
of
the
statute,
the
icc
had
no
jurisdiction
to
order
its
--
it
changed.
in
ruling
against
that
contention,
this
court
discussed
the
government's
changed
philosophy
towards
the
regulation
of
the
railroads
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920
and
the
authoritative
duty
of
the
railroad
--
of
the
commission
to
maintain
a
national
railway
system
and
the
importance
of
the
intrastate
rates
under
such
a
scheme.
the
court
stated
that
the
commission's
authority
over
intrastate
rates
is
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
affirmative
duty
to
fix
rates
and
to
take
other
important
steps
to
maintain
an
adequate
national
railway
system.
and
the
court
said
that
to
hold
--
that
the
commission
could
not
act
until
the
court
--
the
state
had
first
said
in
judgment
upon
the
lawfulness
of
those
rates
would
be
repugnant
to
that
grant
of
authority.
under
this
affirmative
duty
and
the
duty
exist
today
under
the
national
transportation
policy
and
under
the
commission's
rule
of
ratemaking,
section
15
(a)
(2).
the
commission
is
not
required
to
concern
itself
with
any
problem
in
a
case
like
this
other
than
whether
on
the
evidence
before
it.
the
intrastate
rates
do
in
fact
cause
an
undue
revenue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
that
affirmative
duty
cannot
be
performed
satisfactorily
if
the
investigation
is
to
be
limited
to
a
record
developed
in
some
proceeding
over
which
the
icc
has
no
jurisdiction.
this
court's
opinion
in
the
first
florida
log
case
as
well
as
the
opinions
of
two
lower
courts
following
that
decision
were
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
below
and
are
not
discussed
in
its
opinion.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
i
--
i
would
say,
sir,
that
it
would
be
against
the
railroad's
own
interest
to
do
such
a
thing.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that
is
the
holding
--
the
holding
in
the
florida
case
is
that
the
state
commission
did
not
have
to
pass
upon
those
because
of
this
important
duty
of
maintaining
an
adequate
national
transportation
system.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
it's
not.
i
wouldn't
say
it's
abortive.
the
parties
in
the
florida
case
simply
didn't
have
to
go
there.
now,
they
do
go
there
for
many
reasons.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
i
would
say
under
the
florida
decision,
no
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
guess
it
is
with
that.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that
is
true,
sir.
this
is
an
independent
record
and
independent
proceeding.
and
the
questions
are
here
whether
the
findings
support
the
order
and
whether
the
finding
of
the
order
is
based
upon
substantial
evidence.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that's
true,
sir.
and
the
statute
says,
13
(3)
speaks
of
notifying
the
state
where
an
investigation
concerns
a
rate
made
or
imposed
by
the
state.
and
section
13
(4)
then
says,
in
any
investigation
where
you
find
--
where
we
find
a
discrimination,
undue
discrimination,
then
we
shall
correct
--
that
the
commission
shall
correct
it.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
doesn't.
and
the
provision
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that's
quite
true.
for
example,
in
this
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
i
don't
recall
one
but
in
this
very
case
the
commission
says
that
--
that
the
railroad's
explanation
does
not
excuse
its
action
in
not
making
a
full
showing
before
the
state
commission.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
well,
that's
quite
true
but
it's
a
warning
to
other
railroads
too
that
they
should
go
to
the
state
commissions
and
present
a
full
case.
in
--
in
other
words,
the
important
thing
here
was
on
this
record,
was
there
a
showing
of
undue
discrimination?
that's
the
big
question.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
because
under
the
practice,
they
do
go
there,
and
ordinarily,
we
don't
have
the
work
to
perform
in
reviewing
one
of
these
cases.
the
states
will
grant
some
relief
and
we
don't
see
the
case
at
all.
it
cuts
down
on
(inaudible)
that's
a
selfish
reason
for
it.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
a
consideration
of
the
adequacy
of
the
findings
to
support
this
conclusion
of
undue
revenue
discrimination.
while
the
lower
court
does
not
question
the
commission's
finding
that
the
revenues
for
the
suburban
service
were
failing
by
over
$306,000
to
--
to
cover
the
out-of-pocket
cost
of
that
service.
it
held
the
justification
for
the
exercise
of
the
federal
power
did
not
clearly
appear
on
this,
because
the
commission
did
not
also
specifically
find
what
contribution
from
the
suburban
service
would
constitute
a
fair
share
of
the
railroad's
total
revenues.
now,
as
i'll
point
out
in
this
argument,
this
court,
in
the
king's
case
held
that
such
a
specific
finding
was
not
essential
in
a
case
of
this
type.
this
court
of
course
has
stated
that
there
are
no
formal
requisites
for
findings
in
a
case
under
section
13
(3)
and
(4).
this
court
has
also
stated
that
the
findings
on
a
commission's
report
will
vary
with
the
statutory
authority
invoked
and
with
the
context
of
the
situation
presented.
we
say
that
in
the
context
of
the
situation
presented
here,
these
findings
are
applicable.
the
findings
appear
at
pages
36
and
37
of
the
record,
the
commission's
formal
finding.
the
first
finding
is
that
the
existing
suburban
fares
did
not
produce
enough
revenue
to
cover
the
out-of-pocket
cost.
there
is
no
dispute
here
on
that
point.
it's
--
that
formal
finding
is
based
upon
a
summary
in
the
report
of
the
cost
study
submitted
by
the
railroad
and
by
the
commuters.
the
second
finding
is
that
the
suburban
fares
imposed
by
the
state
caused
in
a
less
increase
to
the
extent
prescribed
would
continue
to
cause
an
undue
revenue
--
an
undue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
whole
theory
of
the
commission's
case
is
summed
up,
i
think,
in
the
second
finding.
in
other
words,
as
the
commission
points
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
36
of
the
record
and
going
over
to
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
35
and
going
over
on
to
36,
to
the
extent
that
this
suburban
service
fails
to
meet
the
out-of-pocket
cost
and
make
all
the
contribution
that
it
reasonably
can
to
the
respondent's
indirect
cost.
it
--
it
increases
respondent's
past
through
deficit
and
results
in
an
undue
burden
upon
its
freight
operations,
state
and
interstate.
now,
that's
the
theory
upon
which
the
commission
was
acting
and
i
will
in
a
minute
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
in
the
florida
log
case,
this
court
said
that
more
was
required
that
you
have
to
study
the
revenues
to
see
what
the
old
rate
was
producing
and
what
the
new
rates
would
produce.
but
that
is
the
principal
finding
and
i
will
discuss
in
just
a
moment,
i
think,
this
court's
past
opinion
support
that
holding.
the
third
formal
finding
is
that
the
undue
discrimination
can
and
should
be
removed
by
establishing
fares
not
lower
than
those
prescribed.
now,
in
this
case,
the
commission
thought
that
a
21%
increase
would
cover
all
of
the
proven
out-of-pocket
cost
and
contribute
a
little
to
the
indirect
cost.
the
fourth
formal
finding
is
that
the
prescribed
fares
are
just
unreasonable.
that
can
be
supported
by
the
cost
evidence
here
alone.
while
i
make
that
statement
on
the
brief,
i
cite
no
authority
for
it
but
this
court
has
recognized
the
fact
that
a
cost
study
will
support
a
finding
of
reasonableness.
the
case
to
which
i
refer
and
which
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs
is
the
old
--
illinois
commerce
commission
case
involving
the
chicago
switching
charges.
it's
reported
at
292
united
states
report,
page
474
and
my
particular
page
reference
is
page
484.
the
finding
goes
ahead
to
say
that
the
prescribed
fares
will
produce
substantial
additional
revenue
that's
based
upon
a
discussion
in
the
report
and
in
the
record,
showing
that
over
the
years,
the
patronage
of
this
carrier
and
this
service
has
been
increasing
and
that
it
continued
to
increase
after
the
last
fare
increase
in
1951.
the
commission
was
afraid,
however,
that
the
railroad's
request
for
a
29%
increase
would
adversely
affect
the
movement
of
this
traffic
and
wasn't
willing
to
go
that
high.
therefore,
it
gave
them
21%,
roughly
21%
increase
which
would
deal
substantially
more
revenues.
that
finding
goes
ahead
to
say
that
these
prescribed
fares
are
necessary
to
afford
a
fare
contribution
towards
the
indirect
cost
and
return
and
to
enable
the
carrier
to
provide
adequate
and
efficient
service.
the
commission
also
found
that
the
interstate
suburban
fares
increased
on
the
same
level
would
be
just
and
reasonable.
the
lower
court
thought
that
the
findings
were
inadequate
because
the
report
contains
no
specific
finding
of
what
contribution
from
the
suburban
fares
would
constitute
a
fare
proportion
of
the
railroad's
total
income,
and
as
we
point
out
on
brief,
this
court
in
the
king
case
indicated
that
no
specific
finding
was
essential.
the
lower
court
realizing
that,
then
said,
"well,
there
is
no
finding
here
that
the
revenue
produced
by
the
intrastate
fares
will
contribute
not
more
than
a
fair
proportion
of
the
total
income.
we
think
that
findings
that
the
increases
prescribed
will
be
just
and
reasonable
and
are
necessary
so
that
travel
there
under
may
make
a
fair
contribution,
is
the
equivalent
of
a
finding
that
they
will
contribute
not
more
than
a
fair
proportion.
the
--
the
court
also
criticized
the
findings
because
it's
--
this
last
finding
is
based
upon
a
fair
contribution
towards
indirect
cost
and
return
rather
than
a
fair
contribution
towards
the
total
income.
we
think
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
losing
portion
of
the
business
and
you're
trying
to
cover
the
cost
--
the
out-of-pocket
cost
and
get
some
contribution
to
the
indirect
cost
that
the
phrase
of
fair
contribution
towards
an
indirect
cost
is
more
appropriate
than
the
phrase
"fair
contribution
to
the
total
income."
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
the
--
on
the
fourth
finding,
isn't
it?
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir,
four.
it
will
produce
its
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
they
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
i
say
that
it's
not
challenged.
that
finding
is
not
challenged.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
now,
it's
based
upon
a
showing
in
the
record
that
over
the
years,
the
patronage
of
this
line
has
been
increasing
and
that
even
after
the
last
fare
increase
in
1950
or
1951,
the
patronage
has
continued
to
increase.
in
other
words,
it
shows
a
building
up.
so
the
commission
thought
that
a
21%
increase
would
not
adversely
affect
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
there's
a
basis
for
it.
the
views
of
this
court
in
past
cases,
i
believe,
support
the
proposition
that
a
showing
of
a
non-compensatory
rate
plus
a
showing
that
a
reasonable
increase
in
that
rate
will
produce
substantially
more
revenues
are
adequate
to
support
a
finding
of
an
undue
revenue
discrimination.
for
example,
in
the
first
florida
log
case,
this
court
held
that
the
showing
of
a
non-remunerative
rate
was
not
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
discrimination
that
you
had
to
have
more.
and
the
court
went
ahead
to
say
that
the
more
needed
was
the
study
of
the
revenues
to
see
what
had
been
produced
--
what
were
to
be
produced
under
the
increased
rate.
see
if
it's
going
to
be
substantial
and
if
that
is
necessary
to
eliminate
this
discrimination.
in
the
north
carolina
case,
involving
the
fares
of
four
railroads,
passenger
fares
of
four
railroads
in
that
state
during
world
war
ii,
this
court
said
that
the
order
in
the
second
florida
log
case,
incidentally
the
court
set
aside
the
order
in
the
first
florida
log
case
because
we
haven't
made
this
revenue
study.
the
commission
took
the
case
back
and
made
the
revenue
study,
issued
another
order
and
this
court
upheld
that
order.
and
in
the
north
carolina
case,
in
explaining
why
the
order
in
the
second
florida
log
case
was
upheld,
this
court
said
that
that
order
in
the
second
florida
log
case
was
based
upon
a
finding
supported
by
evidence,
that
the
intrastate
rate
was
abnormally
low,
less
than
reasonably
compensatory,
insufficient
under
all
the
circumstances
and
conditions
to
cover
the
full
cost
of
the
service.
now,
there's
--
this
court
said
in
north
carolina
was
why
the
florida
log
order
was
upheld.
insufficient
under
all
circumstances
to
cover
the
full
cost
of
the
service
that
was
one
commodity
in
florida
moving
a
maximum
distance
over
170
miles.
and
in
the
king
case,
the
court
seems
to
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
extends
to
a
non-compensatory
rate.
there
at
one
place,
the
court
states
near
the
last
part
of
the
opinion.
the
c
--
icc's
jurisdiction
over
intrastate
rates,
however,
is
not
limited
to
cases
where
those
rates
are
non-compensatory.
and
then,
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
king
case,
mr.
justice
douglas,
gave
an
example
of
what
he
considers
to
be
undue
revenue
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
and
here
is
what
he
said
by
way
of
example.
if
intrastate
freight
operations
fail
to
produce
an
adequate
return
as
determined
by
reference
to
the
cost
of
the
intrastate
operations
and
the
investment
in
the
intrastate
business,
interstate
commerce
is
discriminated
against.
if
that
is
an
undue
revenue
discrimination,
we
have
an
aggravated
case
of
it
here.
we
submit
that
in
the
context
of
the
situation
presented
here,
the
finding
relative
to
undue
--
revenue
discrimination
is
ample.
we
believe
that
other
findings,
if
added,
would
in
the
words
of
the
district
court
in
the
new
haven
commutation
fares
case
cited
in
the
brief,
simply
amount
to
a
piling
on
of
more
words
without
an
essential
change
in
substance.
time
does
not
permit
me
to
discuss
these
other
two
points
involving
the
basis
for
the
commission's
finding
that
these
increased
fares
will
be
just
and
reasonable
as
i've
said
before.
i
think
the
cost
alone
supports
it
or
the
propriety
of
setting
aside
the
interstate
order
which
is
not
connected
in
any
way
whatsoever
with
this
question
of
discrimination.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
isn't.
that
point
was
made,
sir,
in
the
case
below
that
--
that
the
contribution
from
the
suburban
service
is
relatively
greater
or
at
least
the
suburban
service
is
relative
better
off
than
the
average
service
of
the
railroad.
the
commission's
answer
to
that
was
and
it's
given
in
the
report
that
simply
because
some
other
segment
of
the
business
is
were
solved
--
is
no
excuse
for
not
trying
to
get
the
cost
and
as
much
to
the
indirect
cost
as
you
can
get
out
to
this
particular
segment.
in
other
words,
it
goes
right
along
with
this
court's
view
in
the
florida
log
case.
this
court
said
in
the
florida
log
case
that
in
a
revenue
discrimination
case,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
relation
of
rates.
we
are
concerned
with
the
relation
of
rates
to
income
from
these
rates
charged,
how
much
income
are
you
getting.
here,
they
don't
even
get
enough
to
cover
the
out-of-pocket
cost
and
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
be
a
so-called
expert
to
see
that
if
a
segment
of
the
business,
in
an
important
segment,
is
not
paying
its
way,
it's
a
drag
on
the
total
service.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that
is
in
itself
a
discrimination.
it
is
a
drag
on
the
total
service.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
well,
that's
the
theory
here
i
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
overall
revenues
of
this
carrier
is
hurting
because
it's
not
paying
its
own
way.
it's
not
even
paying
its
out-of-pocket
cost.
it's
a
drag
on
that
business.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
make
--
in
this
year,
it
made
a
2%
return,
sir,
1954
is
the
year.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
on
the
passenger
business.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
more
but
certainly
paid
their
costs.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir
but
this
court
said
in
the
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
this
court
said
in
the
past
rate
case,
new
york
versus
united
states
report
at
--
at
331
united
states
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
to
correct
all
of
the
evils
in
the
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
that
involved
the
class
rates.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
oh,
it
was
interstate
carriers,
interstate
rates.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
but
we
don't
come
to
that
question
because
this
segment
isn't
even
paying
its
out-of-pocket
cost.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
well,
the
commission
says
if
that's
--
that's
beside
the
point.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
i
--
i
say
that
we
correct
the
--
the
evil
before
us
at
the
time
--
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
no,
because
the
--
the
interstate
rates
are
being
increased,
too,
on
this
very
service.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
well,
let
me
state
that
the
interstate
order
was
not
attacked
in
the
court
below
at
all.
the
complaint
specifically
restricts
itself
and
it's
in
the
record
at
page
6,
i
believe,
to
the
west
line
and
so
much
of
the
traffic
as
on
the
north
line
between
chicago
and
the
illinois
state
line,
that's
page
6
at
the
top
--
top
paragraph,
the
first
full
sentence.
mr.
charlie
h.
johns,
jr.
the
record.
yes,
sir.
the
second
full
sentence.
this
complaint
relates
to
the
entire
west
line
and
to
the
portion
of
the
north
line
that
is
in
illinois
and
that
was
all
that
was
considered
by
the
court
below.
there
was
nothing
said
in
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
about
these
interstate
fares.
they
went
into
effect
in
january.
the
petitions
were
filed
in
february.
we
say
that
under
this
court's
ruling
in
the
tucker
case
that
since
they
didn't
object
to
the
interstate
