justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
simultaneous
application
at
that
stage
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
create
interstate
rates?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
--
does
that
mean
that
in
any
case
where
the
commission
finds
that
an
interstate
rate
was
not
paying
its
way,
that
automatically
results
--
justifies
the
finding
--
the
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
intrastate
passenger
service
is
making
a
greater
or
less
--
proportionate
contribution
to
the
overall
deficit
of
the
railroad
than
the
interstate
passenger
traffic
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
isn't
enough,
is
it?
you've
got
to
show
that
that
also
creates
a
discrimination.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
sentence
is,
if
you
haven't
got
a
problem
with
the
segment
of
your
business,
of
course,
it
is
a
drag
as
far
as
discrimination
is
concerned.
i
don't
see
if
that
follows.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
overall
operation
of
the
railroad?
is
it
making
a
little
bit
of
money?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
then
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is,
necessarily,
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
make
intrastate
rates
than
--
pay
more
than
their
part
of
the
cost.
there's
no
way
that
there's
a
conference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
do
undertake
the
contrast,
don't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
real
position
is,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
findings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
generalized
finding,
the
conclusory
finding,
we
wouldn't
be
concerned
about
those
findings,
would
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
mere
finding
if
it's
an
out-of-pocket
loss,
and
that's
all
you're
basing
in,
is
inadequate
to
support
the
ultimate
finding
of
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
