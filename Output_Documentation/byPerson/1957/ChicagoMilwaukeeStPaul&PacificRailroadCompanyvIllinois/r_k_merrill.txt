mr.
r.
k.
merrill
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
last
issue
which
has
been
raised
by
the
bench,
our
overall
passenger
deficit
on
the
milwaukee
railroad
is
shown
by
the
record
in
this
case
based
on
the
full
cost,
is
157%.
that
means
that
the
full
cost
of
our
entire
passenger
operation
represents
157%
of
our
revenues.
the
record
also
shows
here
that
the
operating
ratio
or
our
deficit
on
our
suburban
service
at
the
time
of
the
investigation
of
our
fares
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
185%.
i
believe
that
answers
the
question
as
to
whether
the
suburban
fares
were
or
were
not
making
a
comparable
contribution
to
that
of
the
overhead
passenger
business.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
i
don't
understand
the
question,
sir.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
no,
sir.
what
i
say
is
that
the
expenses
in
connection
with
the
suburban
service
represent
185%
of
the
revenues.
but
on
the
overall
passenger
business,
the
expenses
represent
only
157%
of
the
revenues.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
look
at
what
would
be
required
if
the
railroad
were
to
be
required
to
segregate
from
all
of
its
passenger
earnings,
all
of
the
expenses
connected
with
the
interstate
service
and
those
connected
with
the
intrastate
service.
the
milwaukee
railroad
operates
in
13
different
states
from
indiana
on
the
east
to
the
state
of
washington
on
the
west.
we
operate
many
passenger
trains
in
all
of
those
states.
most
of
those
trains
carry
both
intrastate
and
interstate
passenger
service.
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
then
could
hold
that
fares
which
are
clearly
non-compensatory
in
illinois
for
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce,
a
railroad
would
be
required
to
make
a
nationwide
study,
in
effect,
of
all
its
trains,
of
all
its
expenses
and
of
all
its
revenues
and
say,
"when
we
get
all
through,
this
much
represents
our
interstate
passenger.
this
much
represents
our
illinois
intrastate
passenger
contribution".
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
i
believe
illinois
is
--
illinois
rates
are
unit
under
themselves.
we
have
an
operation
in
this
case
which
is
a
suburban
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
well
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct
and
i
believe
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
commission,
however,
not
only
to
adjust
the
rates
in
illinois
so
they
do
not
discriminate
or
cause
a
drain
on
the
system
earnings
but
they
would
also
have
the
duty
to
fix
--
bring
up
the
rates
in
washington.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
says
the
commission
must
act
with
respect
to
each
state
at
one
time.
as
mr.
johns
said,
they
deal
with
each
evil
as
it
comes
before
them
and
that
is
what
they
were
doing
here.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
i
think
if
they
could
show
that
was
true,
they
could
raise
that
point,
mr.
justice
but
they
did
not
raise
it
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
no,
sir.
there
are
no
findings
other
than
with
respect
to
what
contribution
the
illinois
rates
are
not
making.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
no,
sir.
now,
i
think
there
were
some
discussion
here
as
to
what
the
railroad
was
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
what
they
said
was
that
the
interstate
business
would
be
discriminating
against
the
intrastate
business,
mr.
justice.
that
was
the
contention
raised.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
if
that
were
correct,
they
could
not
do
it,
sir,
but
it
is
not
correct.
now,
the
railroad
did
not
go
before
the
state
commission
and
do
any
shadowboxing.
in
1952,
we
had
an
out-of-pocket
loss
from
our
operation
of
over
$1
million.
we
went
to
the
state
commission
and
we
pleaded
for
prompt
action.
we
put
in
our
case
and
the
figures
we
put
in
were
not
inflated.
the
commuters'
association
itself
concedes
that
we
had
a
loss
of
$864,000
and
a
full
cost
deficit
of
$1
million
--
of
$2,144,000
deficit
at
the
time
we
went
to
the
state
commission.
the
state
commission,
however,
disregarded
our
pleas
for
relief
and
they
kicked
the
case
around
for
two
years
and
four
months.
it
took
only
two
days
for
the
railroad
to
put
in
its
evidence.
they
let
it
drag
for
two
years
and
four
months
before
they
finally
said
to
us,
"with
the
diesel
operation,
you
would
have
a
profit
of
$224,000
a
year,
over
and
above
your
out-of-pocket
cost.
you
are
now
dieselized,"
and
that
happened
a
year
after
the
record
was
completed
before
the
commission,
“therefore,
you're
entitled
to
no
increase
whatsoever.”
now,
with
the
dieselization,
we
were
able
to
reduce
our
expenses
to
what
we
deemed
--
what
we
computed
our
out-of-pocket
loss
to
be
$700,000
a
year.
we
are
just
been
turned
down
on
a
showing
of
over
a
million
dollars
a
year
out-of-pocket
loss.
we
deemed
that
these
rates
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce
and
we
approach
what
the
interstate
commerce
commission
what
they
petitioned,
asking
that
they
investigate
and
determine
whether
that
was
not
the
result
of
the
raise.
now,
this
question
is
originally
before
the
illinois
central
railroad
has
had
increases
in
its
fares
ordered
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
illinois
commerce
commission
has
gone
to
the
federal
courts
and
attempt
to
just
set
it
aside.
and
the
lower
court
in
chicago,
the
federal
court
said,
"we
find
that
the
illinois
central
fares
in
the
suburban
territory,
as
compared
with
their
overall
passenger
deficit,
result
in
a
deficit
both
relatively
and
absolutely
lower
or
less
than
the
overall
passenger
deficit."
and
notwithstanding
that
they
could
make
that
specific
finding,
the
lower
court
upheld
the
commission
order
increasing
those
fares,
and
this
court
on
appeal,
affirmed
it
on
rehearing,
again
affirmed
the
order
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
under
the
illinois
public
utilities
act,
sir.
along
with
it,
we
ask,
instead
of
just
a
blanket
increase,
it
would
eliminate
our
entire
out-of-pocket
loss,
we
asked
for
a
way
to
discontinue
our
non-rush
hour
trains
where
there
might
be
fewer
people
riding
than
there
were
members
of
the
train
crew.
and
with
that
savings,
we
could
reduce
the
amount
of
the
increase
if
we
sought
from
the
commission.
the
commission
said
you
will
not
take
off
one
train.
you
will
continue
to
run
the
whole
service
whatever
loss
it
produces
and
you
will
not
have
one
cent
increase
in
your
fares.
now,
i'd
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
what
the
effect
of
this
order
is.
the
state
says
it
takes
away
our
jurisdiction.
now,
what
it
does,
it
takes
away
their
power
to
compel
the
railroad
to
charge
fares
less
than
those
which
they
have
prescribed.
and
that's
the
power
which
--
perhaps
they
never
had
because
in
the
north
dakota
and
west
virginia
cases,
it
was
held
that
the
state
cannot
single
out
a
class
of
traffic
and
make
it
operate
at
a
loss.
at
an
out-of-pocket
loss
or
it
is
depriving
the
railroad
of
its
protection
under
the
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
north
dakota
case,
they
were
dealing
only
with
the
rates
on
midnight.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
and
passengers
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
--
in
the
chicago
suburban
area
where
we
all
--
all
the
16,000
people
a
day
are
very
important
to
the
milwaukee
railroad.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
as
to
the
total
passengers,
sir,
i
cannot
tell
you.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
i
would
say
that
our
total
revenue
from
this
traffic
as
found
by
the
commission
here
is
approximately
$2
million
a
year.
now
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
sir?
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
and
it
is
to
a
railroad
with
2%
return.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
that's
on
a
fully
distributed
cost
basis.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
it
was
over
$22
million
and
that
includes
all
our
intrastate
as
well
as
our
interstate
operation.
it's
not
the
interstate
versus
this
particular
loss
on
the
suburban
service.
now,
the
effect
then
would
not
deprive
them
of
their
power
because
this
court
in
the
wisconsin
railroad
commission
case
which
they
decided
very
soon
after
the
section
13
(4)
was
enacted
had
this
to
say.
when
the
state
commission
shall
recognize
their
obligation
to
maintain
a
proportionate
and
equitable
share
of
the
income
of
the
carriers
from
intrastate
rates,
conferences
between
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
state
commissions
may
dispense
the
necessity
for
any
rigid
federal
order
and
leave
the
state
commissions
free
to
increase
or
reduce
those
rates
in
their
discretion.
now,
as
to
the
effect
of
these
rates
on
a
commuter
from
the
opposition
that
would
appear
that
they
are
going
to
pay
a
very
unreasonably
high
rate,
actually,
they
will
pay
the
same
rate
as
their
fellow
commuter
has
been
paying
for
the
last
four
years
in
the
adjoining
chicago
and
northwestern
railroad.
they
will
pay
lower
rates
that
are
now
in
effect
in
the
chicago
suburban
area
and
the
illinois
central
railroad
and
the
chicago
south
shore
railroad.
they
will
pay
the
same
rates
that
are
in
effect
on
the
chicago,
rock
island
and
pacific
railroad
within
that
area.
they
are
receiving
service
which
cause
the
railroad
3
cents
a
passenger
mile
to
perform
on
a
full
cost
basis.
at
the
time
of
this
--
of
the
hearing
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
were
paying
only
one
and
six
tenth
cents
of
that
cost.
as
the
result
of
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
are
paying
less
than
2
cents
a
mile
of
that
cost.
therefore,
since
these
rates
went
into
effect
on
april
20,
1956,
these
commuters
have
been
excused
from
paying
over
$1,750,000
of
the
full
cost
rendering
the
service
and
they
are
now
seeking
by
this
proceeding
here
to
compel
the
railroad
to
refund
another
$575,000
out
of
the
already
inadequate
fares
which
they
have
paid
to
the
railroad
and
they
will
thereby
increase
the
bargain
which
they
are
receiving
at
the
hands
of
the
railroads.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
directed
by
congress
to
administer
the
interstate
commerce
act
so
as
to
encourage
transportation
--
to
encourage
reasonable
charges
for
transportation
without
unjust
discrimination
and
to
foster
sound
economic
conditions
among
the
carriers
subject
to
its
regulation,
all
to
the
end
of
developing
and
preserving
a
national
transportation
system,
adequate
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
commerce
of
the
united
states,
of
the
postal
system
and
of
the
national
defense.
this
court
has
said
that
the
commission
may
impose
upon
any
use
by
a
state
of
an
interstate
system
for
intrastate
commerce,
any
reasonable
condition
which
it
deems
necessary
or
desirable.
now,
the
condition
imposed
here
is
that
the
commuters
on
the
milwaukee
railroad,
instead
of
paying
about
one
half
of
the
cost
of
the
service,
should
pay
two
thirds
of
the
cost
of
that
service.
certainly,
that
is
a
reasonable
requirement.
and
certainly,
it
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
towards
fixing
fares
on
a
realistic
basis
if
there
is
to
be
a
survival
of
the
national
transportation
system.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
that's
my
understanding
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
--
sir.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
no,
sir.
it
would
not.
we
would
also
have
to
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
yes.
we'd
have
to
show
that
there
was
evidence
that
supported
the
finding
that
the
proposed
fares
were
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
well,
i
would
be
glad
to
have
mr.
johns
answer
it
because
i
was
--
mr.
r.
k.
merrill
i
am
--
completed,
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
