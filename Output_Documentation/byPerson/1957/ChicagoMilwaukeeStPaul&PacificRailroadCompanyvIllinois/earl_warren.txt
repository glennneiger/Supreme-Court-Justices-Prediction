mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
why
weren't
they
presented
to
the
state
commission?
do
you
know
what
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
normal
practice
before
state
commissions
if
they
just
give
the
state
commission
what
they
think
is
sufficient
or
--
or
do
--
do
they
put
on
their
whole
case
before
they
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
what
alternative
the
state
commission
had
at
that
--
at
that
juncture?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
there
was
a
mandate
then
rather
than
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
carry
that
to
the
extent
that
the
railroad
company
can
make
just
a
pro
forma
complaint
before
a
state
commission
and
not
introduce
--
not
make
a
real
case
and
then
when
the
decision
went
against
it
to
go
to
the
icc?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
do
it
under
the
rule
you
just
announced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
the
state
procedure
is
just
abortive.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
have
to
go
there
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
it
is
abortive
if
they
didn't
have
to
go
and
if
this
is
a
new
proceeding,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
should
--
then
we
--
we
should
consider
this
as
though
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
railroad
company
to
go
to
the
state
commission
and
that
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
finding
of
the
state
commission
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
johns,
the
only
thing
that
i
--
i
haven't
got
quite
straight
in
my
mind
is
this.
why
should
the
commission
say
that
they
were
not
excused
for
not
putting
on
a
full
case
before
--
the
state
court
when
there
was
no
necessity
for
putting
on
any
case?
no
necessity
for
employing
there
at
all
under
your
--
under
your
theory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
will
provide
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
merrill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you
finish
your
last
--
have
you
finished
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
mr.
johns,
could
you
answer
that
question
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
begley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
a
minute
or
two
more
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
minutes
left
in
your
time.
