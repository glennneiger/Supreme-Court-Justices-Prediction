justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there's
no
finding
here
to
(inaudible)
i
understood
you
to
say
to
justice
harlan,
there
was
no
finding
here
that
this
loss
was
any
greater
than
that
--
more
on
the
other
parts
of
railroads
on
the
interstate
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
if
it's
their
cost,
do
you
say
that
the
commission
can
go
ahead
and
let
other
places
--
interstate
fares
--
lose
money
and
yet
you
can
make
the
people
who
carry
intrastate
rates
to
pay
more,
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
case
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
kind
of
carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
interstate
carriers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
interstate
carriers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
here
intrastate
carriers
as
--
as
compared
with
interstate
carriers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
the
commission
takes
the
position
that
it
inquire
intrastate
carriers
to
pay
more
than
their
part
of
the
--
of
the
load?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
would
be
true,
wouldn't
it?
if
you
pick
up
the
segment
of
intrastate
commerce
and
say
it
got
to
make
good
100%
but
interstate
doesn't.
that's
why
you
have
general
losses
you
have
to
determined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
but
what
about
the
other
sections.
are
there
any
other
sections
that
are
doing
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it's
beside
the
point,
however,
if
this
is
a
particular
kind
of
relationship
which
the
government
only
recently
entered
into
at
much
protest,
after
requiring
the
intrastate
rates
to
be
raised
as
a
further
requirement,
extra
burdens,
it
must
be
born
in
order
for
the
commission
have
power
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
commission
could
do
that
and
make
the
intrastate
rates
be
a
100%
to
see
that
they
don't
have
a
set
law
without
seeing
if
the
other
part
of
the
road
operate
on
the
same
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
you
pick
out
however
the
intrastate
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
would
be,
wouldn't
it
if
they
made
35%
less
than
the
cost
which
the
commission
think
the
cost
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
a
185%
loss
on
that
suburban
and
135%
loss
on
the
whole.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
what
was
raised,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
(inaudible)
where
they
did
raise
the
question.
there
is
no
finding
that
the
--
their
--
their
part
when
you
hold
this
much
rate
on
them
and
wouldn't
discriminate
on
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
if
that
were
correct,
icc
could
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
the
passenger
deficit
of
the
railroad
is
over
$22
million,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
--
i
take
it.
i
want
to
be
sure
but
i'm
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
state
would
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
what
you
said
there,
you
talk
a
little
fast.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
are
you
saying
that
if
the
intrastate
wage,
if
the
court
below
should
sustain
on
the
section
on
the
intrastate
rates,
it
would
be
compelled
to
sustain
it
on
what
it
did
to
the
interstate
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
were
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
why
--
why
couldn't
we
consider
the
power
of
difference
in
reference
to
the
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
the
find
--
do
you
consider
the
findings
required
are
the
same
for
setting
aside
an
order
relating
to
interstate
rates
and
for
setting
aside
an
order
relating
to
intrastate
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
could
put
that
in
the
brief
so
that
i
could
even
then
derive
an
act
of
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
that.
i
think
you
are
wrong.
