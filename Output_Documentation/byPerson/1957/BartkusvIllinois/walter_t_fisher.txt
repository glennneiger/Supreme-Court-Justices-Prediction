mr.
walter
t.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
i
represent
a
prisoner
in
the
illinois
penitentiary.
he
is
serving
a
sentence,
a
life
sentence
for
bank
robbery.
this
court
granted
his
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
illinois
supreme
court's
affirmance
of
his
conviction
and
appointed
counsel
for
petitioner.
our
principal
--
our
principal
contention
is
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
not
accorded
petitioner
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
a
disregard
of
due
process
in
several
quite
different
respects.
the
variety
of
bad
procedures
that
were
applied
to
this
man
is
striking.
the
procedural
facts
surrounding
his
trial
are
malodorous,
but
the
court
need
not
reach
the
doctrine
of
the
facts
as
a
whole
being
so
shocking
as
to
deny
the
due
process.
we
contend
that
they
are
with
the
specific
denials
of
due
process
or
in
themselves
quite
sufficient
grounds
for
reversal.
the
two
most
critical
issues
are,
first,
that
illinois
tried
him
over
again
after
he
had
been
acquitted
by
a
federal
court.
and
second,
and
it
is
entirely
separate
and
independent
ground
of
reversal,
that
illinois
convicted
him
on
the
basis
of
unconstitutional
activities
of
federal
officers.
here
are
the
facts
and
they
are
not
disputed.
in
1953,
a
savings
and
loan
association
in
cooke
county
was
robbed
by
two
arms
men.
they
took
some
$4000
and
fled
in
a
car.
the
driver
was
waiting
in
the
car,
petitioner,
then
26
years
old,
heard
that
he
was
wanted
and
he
went
to
united
states
marshal's
office
where
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
being
the
driver
of
that
car.
and
his
defense
was
simply
that
they
had
the
wrong
man.
at
the
trial
of
petitioner,
the
identity
of
the
driver
of
the
car
was
the
only
issue.
he
took
the
stand,
he
and
other
witnesses
testified
that
he
was
far
away
from
the
robbery
at
the
time
it
occurred
and
the
testimony
against
him
was
by
alleged
accomplices.
this
trial
was
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
and
it
was
for
violation
of
the
federal
bank
robbery
act.
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
was
the
savings
and
loan
association,
which
was
robbed,
was
federally
insured,
insured
for
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation.
incidentally,
94%
of
all
savings
and
loan
associations
in
this
country
are
federally
insured.
and
the
existence
of
the
insurance
was
stipulated
in
this
case.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that
are
insured
by
the
fdic?
i
think
87%
--
87%
of
banks,
as
i
recall,
are
--
are
insured.
that's
both
state
and
national
banks.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
it's
all
banks,
national
and
state,
14,777
only
are
not
insured
by
the
fdic.
petitioner
was
found
not
guilty
by
the
federal
jury
and
was
acquitted.
now,
we
come
to
the
facts
bearing
on
other
point,
the
activities
of
the
federal
officers.
the
united
states
district
judge
was
dissatisfied
with
the
verdict
and
he
proceeded
to
criticize
the
jury
in
most
unusual
fashion.some
of
the
details
are
in
our
brief.
the
judge's
conduct
and
the
widespread
publicity
that
was
given
to
it
were
of
the
nature
to
encourage
the
retrial
of
petitioner
in
the
state
court.
and
the
states
attorney
of
cooke
county
said
on
the
record
that
the
federal
authorities
came
to
him
after
petitioner's
federal
acquittal.
petitioner
was
turned
over
to
state
custody
and
indicted
the
second
time
for
the
same
robbery.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
in
--
in
the
federal
case,
he
had
two
accomplishes
but
they
were
not
--
they
were
not
tried
with
him.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no.
he
was
the
sole
defendant.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
did
they
plead
guilty?
they
weren't
tried.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
they
--
i
don't
think
they
were
indicted
at
this
time.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
don't
think
the
record
shows.
they
were
--
i
happen
to
know
that
they
--
i
don't
think
mr.
wines
objected.
they
were
subsequently
--
they
were
subsequently
placed
under
--
under
the
federal
--
under
parole
under
the
federal
parole
act.
now,
in
spite
of
--
of
petitioner's
acquittal
by
the
federal
court,
the
federal
government
kept
on
working
for
his
conviction.
the
fbi
agents
in
--
disregard,
as
we
contend,
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment,
interviewed
one
of
petitioner's
alibi
witnesses
and
turned
over
the
information
to
the
state
authorities.
a
special
agent
and
the
united
states
attorney
also
interviewed
an
entirely
new
witness,
one
had
not
testified
in
the
previous
case.
and
they
asked
the
new
witness
to
come
in
to
the
state
court
and
testify.
the
federal
agents
did
the
interviewing.
the
illinois
prosecutor
did
not
talk
with
this
new
witness
until
the
day
he
testified
at
the
state
trial.
this
activity
of
the
federal
officers,
as
i
say,
is
an
entirely
independent
ground
of
reversal
separate
from
the
former
acquittal
point.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that
was
not
--
that
was
not
put
in
issue
in
this
case,
but
the
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
that
the
issues
were
the
same
except
for
the
alibi.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
so
treated
the
matter.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
in
the
recitals
that
i've
given
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
that
they
are
all
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
they
are
all
in
--
they
are
all
in
there.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no,
they're
either
in
the
brief
or
that
book,
either
our
brief
or
in
that
record.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
the
stenographic
record
is
with
the
clerk.
except
the
fact
that
i
mentioned
about
what
happened
to
the
--
to
the
accomplices,
alleged
accomplices
is
subsequent
to
that
--
to
that,
i
did
--
i
have
given
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
you
see,
he
was
acquitted
so
that
no
significant
of
evidence
was
made
and
there
is
--
there
is
a
stenographic
record
of
it.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that's
not
in
evidence
in
any
way.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
it's
not
certified
or
in
evidence.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
those
--
those
remarks
are
from
newspaper
clippings
in
the
chicago
press
that
i
have
appended
to
my
brief
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
your
honors.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
and
i
felt
justified
in
doing
that
because
this
became
such
a
famous
matter
that
this
judge
attempted
to
defend
himself
in
another
case
and
his
action
in
this
case
that
they
were
so
severely
criticized
in
chicago
that
he
attempted
to
defend
himself
and
it
came
into
the
record
another
case,
went
up
to
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
our
circuit.
and
there,
it
was
discussed
by
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
judge
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
and
it
upper
to
me
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
that
under
those
circumstances
that
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
those
facts.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
if
our
position
is
that
the
federal
officers
utilized
the
state
court
as
their
instrument
in
doing
what
the
federal
government
is
forbidding
to
do
with
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
not
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
issue,
as
i've
said
in
the
second
trial,
was
the
same
as
that
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
those
materials
were
--
were
in
the
record
as
to
the
activities
of
these
officers.
the
test
--
the
fact
that
the
interviewing
of
the
witnesses
and
turning
over
to
the
evidence
to
the
state
authorities
is
in
the
record,
mr.
justice.
the
only
thing
that
i
said
was
not
in
the
record
and
from
the
newspaper
clippings
was
the
--
were
the
statements
of
the
federal
district
judge.
the
issue
in
the
second
trial,
as
i
have
said,
was
the
same
as
in
the
first
and
that
issue
was
the
identity
of
the
person
driving
the
car
used
in
the
escape.
this
is
all
perfectly
clear
from
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
and
it
is
not
disputed.
and
petitioner
was
found
guilty
in
the
second
case.
now,
the
reason
why
he
received
life
imprisonment
was
because
it
was
mandatory
under
the
illinois
second
offender
statute
then
enforced.
that
statute
provided
that
a
prior
conviction
in
a
different
case
be
mentioned
in
the
indictment
and
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
and
there
are
statutes
like
that
in
a
number
--
in
the
number
of
states.
and
that
feature
of
the
statute,
however,
i
am
glad
to
say
has
been
repealed
this
year,
so
that
illinois
is
no
longer
in
what
i
regard
as
the
disgraceful
position
for
juries
are
told
of
former
offenses,
where
they
must
be
told
a
former
offenses
if
the
habitual
criminal
feature
is
to
be
used.
if
the
second
offender
feature
is
to
be
used,
you
have
to
put
it
in
the
indictment
under
this
old
statute.
but,
of
course,
the
repeal
is
not
retroactive,
it
does
not
apply
to
my
client.
now,
in
addition
to
these
two
points
i
have
mentioned,
and
we
do,
in
our
brief,
raised
as
an
independent
ground
of
reversal,
but
we
regard
as
an
extremely
unfair
application
of
that
provision
to
this
case.
and
i'm
sure
we
will
not
have
time
today
to
argue
with
it
orally.
today,
i
want
to
argue
with
three
grounds
of
reversal
orally,
and
they
are
separate
and
independent
grounds
of
each
other.
one
is
that
petitioner
was
tried
over
again
after
being
acquitted
for
identically
the
same
affair.
the
second
is
the
unconstitutional
participation
of
the
federal
officers.
and
the
third
is
encroachment
by
the
state
of
illinois
on
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
now,
on
our
first
point,
it's
undisputed
that
the
second
trial
different
from
the
first
in
only
two
respects,
the
fact
that
the
federal
insurance
did
not
have
to
be
proved
in
the
state
case.
and
the
second
trial
occurred
in
the
state
court
rather
in
the
federal
court.
those
are
the
only
differences.
now,
such
differences
have
been
thought
in
various
cases
to
permit
double
prosecutions.
but
we
disagree
and
we
contend
that
from
the
standpoint
of
due
process,
those
two
differences
are
not
of
a
nature
to
justify
a
second
trial
for
what
is
in
fact
the
same
offense.
due
process
is,
of
course,
a
matter
of
substance.
and
this
question
is
an
open
question
for
this
court,
as
i
propose
to
show.
putting
it
in
other
words,
i
propose
to
show
that
it
was
the
same
offense
in
both
trials,
the
same
offense
in
both
trials,
and
that
the
matter
of
the
difference
in
jurisdictions
ought
not
to
make
any
difference.
now,
of
course,
our
premise
is
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
state
of
illinois,
by
itself,
may
not
keep
on
prosecuting
a
man
after
he
has
been
acquitted.
our
position
here
is
based
on
the
defense
in
this
--
this
big
part
of
our
case.
our
position
is
based
on
the
defense
of
former
acquittal
not
on
double
jeopardy
as
a
whole.
we
contend
that
the
inviability
of
a
former
acquittal
is
part
of
due
process
of
law.
and
palko
against
connecticut
and
other
cases
of
this
court
have
expressly
left
that
question
open.
in
our
brief
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
don't
think
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
i
don't
think
he
ought
to
be.
i'm
candid
to
say,
mr.
justice,
that
that
is
not
our
case.
our
case
is
acquittal
and
acquittal
is
thoroughly
distinguishable
from
former
conviction
that
has
--
that
has
been
distinguished
as
we
show
in
our
briefs
since
the
time
of
the
yearbooks.
it's
absolutely
fundamental
part
of
order
of
liberty.
it
goes
back
way
behind
--
before
the
right
of
counsel
and
it
is
--
if
you
think
that
defense
of
former
conviction
which
is
always
--
as
a
separate
plea
of
common
law,
if
you
feel
that
that
is
a
separate
--
is
a
separate
matter
and
is
important
and
is
part
of
due
process,
why,
former
acquittal
is
even
more
sacred.
now,
today,
i'm
going
to
assume
that
it
is
clear
beyond
doubt
that
illinois
couldn't
try
a
man
who've
been
acquitted
over
again
for
identically
the
same
thing.
i
mean
take
the
example
which
is
not
our
case
with
a
crime
for
something
that
is
admittedly
the
same
offense
under,
identically,
the
same
statute.
i
don't
believe
that
the
illinois
was
seriously
content
that
it
will
keep
on
trying
a
man
over
again
under
the
same
statute
for
the
--
for
the
same
offense
constitutionally.
i'd
say
--
i
believe
we
have
lots
of
material
but
i
will
assume
it
now.
now,
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
matter
of
the
two
jurisdictions,
the
state
and
the
federal,
we
contend
that
the
federal
and
state
offenses
are
the
same
offense
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
in
other
words,
before
we
get
to
the
matter
of
the
two
jurisdictions,
i
must
first
persuade
you
that
neither
the
federal
government
acting
alone
nor
the
state
acting
alone
could
try
a
man
twice
for
the
same
act
of
robbery
under
two
federal
statutes
that
are
similar
as
these
two
statutes
here
or
under
two
state
statutes,
it
different
no
more
than
the
two
statutes
in
this
case.
that's
what
i
must
persuade
you
first.
later,
we
reach
our
position
that
what
they
cannot
do
separately,
they
cannot
do
in
combination.
defendant
was
tried
the
second
time
for
identically
the
same
convict
as
in
the
first
trial.
he
wasn't
accused
of
robbing
different
banks
or
different
people
as
in
the
whole
case
that
has
been
set
to
follow
this
case
in
argument.
our
case
now
is
not
a
case
involving
fragmentation
of
crime
for
purposes
of
increasing
the
punishment.
that's
like
the
ladner
case
which
comes
after
the
hoag
case
that
has
been
set
in
this
group
of
three.
ladner
is
a
punishment
case.
it's
not
a
double
jeopardy
case
at
all.
there
was
only
one
trial.
you
can't
have
double
jeopardy
unless
there
are
two
trials.
and
what
isn't
appropriate
unit
of
crime,
unit
of
the
crime
or
unit
of
prosecution
is
--
is
a
different
thing
in
punishment
cases
and
it
isn't
a
double
jeopardy
case.
the
appropriate
--
the
appropriate
unit
might
permit
a
man's
punishment
to
be
increased
if
it
cuts
more
mail
bags,
for
example,
or
if
he
steals
more
money.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
man
can
constitutionally
be
retried
for
each
unit
or
for
each
piece
of
paper
money.
punishment
can
be
graded
for
--
for
the
size
and
number
of
the
offense.
it's
--
it's
clear
from
reading
all
these
cases
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
unit
of
the
crime
for
all
purposes.
now,
this
court
has
ruled
that
there
are
two
offenses
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy
and
each
statute
requires
proof
of
an
additional
fact
which
the
other
statute
does
not.
but
surely,
this
is
basic.
that's
separate
fact
must
have
some
significance,
some
significance
in
the
way
of
a
separate
statutory
purpose
or
policy.
and
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
that.
the
federal
bank
robbery
act
makes
it
a
crime
to
rob
a
national
bank,
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
maybe
those
are
separate
offenses
now.
but
let's
suppose
the
congress
removes
all
question
and
specifically
makes
them
separate
offenses.
in
similar
fashion,
illinois
could,
of
course,
make
separate
offenses
of
robbing
a
state
bank,
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
the
states,
of
course,
are
free
to
--
to
protect
federal
institutions
and
separate
offensive
robbery
in
the
bank
building,
robbery
after
nightfall,
robbery
with
a
gun,
robbery
with
a
mask,
a
dozen
more
offenses,
each
with
its
unique
fact
to
be
proved
as
required
by
that
statute.
and
those
would
be
perfectly
good
separate
offenses
for
purposes
of
counts
and
for
purposes
of
punishment,
for
purposes
of
the
prosecutor's
option
as
to
which
he
shall
try.
but
it
is
a
very
different
thing
to
say
that
they
create
separate
offenses
so
as
to
allow
a
man
to
be
acquitted
one
or
more
times
and
then
tried
over
and
over
again
for
the
same
transaction.
i'm
sure
this
court
would
never
stand
for
it.
unless
this
separate
fact
in
each
of
these
statutes
would
reflect
some
separate
purpose
or
policy
to
permit
retrials
would
reduce
the
constitution
--
would
--
would
deprive
the
constitution
of
substance.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
it's
the
function
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
to
decide
whether
a
difference
--
is
the
difference
of
words
merely,
a
verbal
difference,
a
different
sub
trivialities
or
a
difference
of
constitutional
substance.
and
to
say
that
you
could
--
that
you
--
a
man
can
be
tried
twice
federally,
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
two
jurisdictions
now
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
tried
twice
federally
or
twice
by
a
state
for
robbing
the
same
institution
because
one
time
it's
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
other
time
that
it's
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system
is
something
i
am
certain
this
court
would
never
stand
for
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
that's
not
what
the
constitution
is.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no,
no.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
not
unless
the
mails
are
being
interfered
with.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that
might
--
that
might
easily
be
a
separate
purpose.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
it's
up
to
this
--
it's
up
to
this
court
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
this
court
must
decide
each
time
whether
there
is
--
whether
there's
substance
in
the
difference
or
not.
it
must
decide
whether
it's
a
matter
of
form
or
a
matter
of
substance.
you
can't
take
the
case
--
take
the
case
of
a
--
take
the
case
of
a
man
being
convicted
of
assault
in
the
state
and
then
being
tried
federally
for
deprivation
of
the
civil
right
to
vote.
it
would
appear
there,
it's
a
very
strong
ground
to
argue.
and
it
would
seem
to
me,
there
was
a
separate
policy
there,
quite
a
separate
policy.
but
this
--
the
bank
robbery
statute
is
not
that
kind
of
a
--
of
a
statute.
the
bank
--
the
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
bank
robbery
act
makes
it
clear
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
bank
robbery
act
was
to
assist
state
enforcement,
to
provide
the
resources
of
federal
enforcement,
to
help
stop
roving
gang
or
interstate
gangs
of
bank
robbers.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
of
course,
it
would
be
a
different
policy.
the
standard
case
in
the
textbooks
is
out
of
a
man
who's
tried
for
selling
liquor
to
a
minor
on
sunday.
there
are
two
entirely
different
statutory
purposes
there.
and
you
might
have
given
the
case
in
my
case
for
example.
my
man
was
accused
of
being
in
the
getaway
car.
now,
i
supposed
he'd
been
tried
for
illegal
parking
by
a
hydrant,
that
would
be
entirely
separate
purpose.
and
this
was
brought
out
in
the
case
that
is
cited
in
this
court,
the
case
of
this
court
that
is
often
cited
in
this
connection,
that's
the
javier
case
from
the
philippine
islands.
and
that
case
is
cited
over
and
over
again
with
the
state.
it
is
repeated
that
its
--
its
two-statute,
its
two
offenses
if
there
are
--
if
there
are
two
separate
statutory
requirements.but
in
--
in
the
javier
case,
itself,
in
the
opinion
of
that
court,
the
court
referred
to
the
separate
gist
of
the
two
statutes
there
involved.
there
were
other
minor
offenses
but
remind
the
court
in
javier,
the
man
was
tried
one
time
for
creating
a
brawl
under
philippine
law
and
other
time
for
insulting
an
official
and
the
court
found
--
the
court
went
into
the
inquiry
and
inquire
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
gist
of
the
offenses.
they
--
they
referred
to
it
right
there
and
they
said,
"these
offenses
have
a
different
gist,"
sometimes
the
word
"gravamen"
is
used.
social
purpose
or
policy
is
sometimes
used.
but
there
is
no
difference
in
the
--
in
these
bank
robbery
statutes.
the
federal
act,
as
i
say,
was
simply
concerned
with
enforcement.
and
the
jurisdictional
requirement,
the
jurisdictional
requirement
of
federal
insurance
in
the
case
of
bank
robbery
is
like
the
jurisdictional
requirement
that
for
illinois
to
prosecute,
the
offense
must
be
committed
in
illinois.
that
must
be
proved.
mr.
wines
refers
to
that,
i
believe,
in
one
of
the
earlier
briefs
in
the
case.
that's
not
his.
but,
of
course,
the
act
was
committed
in
illinois.
well,
here,
we
have
--
we
have
to
prove
the
jurisdictional
requirement
and
the
crime
had
to
be
proved
that
this
institution
was
robbed,
the
institution
was
insured.
a
decision
for
petitioner
would
not
create
a
precedent
against
retrials
in
--
in
civil
rights
cases
or
in
any
other
case
where
the
court
inquires
into
the
matter
to
find
out
whether
there's
a
substantial
difference
in
these
statutes.
in
our
reply
brief,
on
page
5,
we
show
how
foreign
countries
will
not
retry
a
man
who's
been
acquitted
in
another
country.
the
notion
that
because
there
are
two
sovereignties,
you
should
try
a
man
over
again
is
--
is
not
only
unfounded
and
as
far
as
the
common
law
jurisdictions
are
concern,
it
is
unfounded
as
far
as
--
as
most
--
more
advanced
european
countries
are
concerned.
but
they
won't
retry
a
man.
but
there's
always
an
exception
under
the
law
of
france
and
those
--
some
other
countries,
in
treason
or
other
national
security
cases
because
there,
the
foreign
country
would
have
a
different
policy.
but
everybody
is
united,
all
countries,
all
civilized
countries
and
certainly,
the
states
and
the
nation
are
united
in
one
common
policy
against
bank
robbery.
but
the
mere
fact
that
federal
jurisdiction
alone
cannot
create
a
separate
policy.
that's
the
--
that's
--
that
seemed
to
be
sufficiently
clear
that
couldn't
be
done
but
we
can
go
back
to
the
fact
that
the
states
are
free
to
enforce
federal
--
protect
federal
rights
in
the
early
part
of
the
history
of
our
country
that
that
was
the
standard
way
for
the
first
--
for
the
first
half
century
i
believe.
the
states
courts
--
and
states
were
largely
relied
upon
to
protect
federal
rights
as
in
counterfeiting.
and
a
state
could
pass
a
statute
making
it
a
crime
to
rob
a
bank.it's
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
for
example.
let's
say
that
--
that
--
the
state
having
to
create
in
such
a
crime
and
the
federal
government
having
also
create
in
such
a
crime,
makes
it
necessarily
a
separate
policy
because
the
--
because
the
jurisdictions
are
different,
because
the
federal
government
always
have
a
separate
policy.
it's
obviously
without
substance.
that's
obviously
a
form
of
--
of
verbalistic
conceptualism.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
and
they've
held
there
were
different
policies.some
of
the
state,
there
were
different
policies
because
the
state
policy
was
directed
simply
against
fraud
and
the
federal
policy
was
to
protect
the
currency
and
that
may
very
well
be.
i
do
not
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
don't
quarrel
with
any
--
i
don't
quarrel
with
any
decision
for
--
that
--
that
is
founded
in
reason
where
there
is
a
different
policy.
but
i
do
quarrel
with
saying
because
there
are
two
statutes
or
two
jurisdictions
ipso
facto
they
are
different.
that
would
deprive
our
constitution
of
substance
and
reduce
the
double
jeopardy
provision
to
a
form
of
words.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that's
so
far
as
i've
gone
so
far.
here's
perhaps
a
good
place
to
mention
that
a
collusive
trial
never
bars
a
second
trial.
that
is
under
established
common
law
principles.
and
the
rationale,
of
course,
is
that
if
it
was
collusive,
why
the
man
was
never
in
jeopardy.
now,
i've
come
to
the
critical
issue
of
prosecution
by
different
jurisdictions
where
the
court
finds
the
offenses
would
otherwise
be
the
same.
in
the
first
place,
the
defense
of
former
acquittal
is
for
the
protection
of
the
accused
and
is
neither
the
protection
is
identically
the
same
whether
the
successive
prosecutions
or
by
the
same
or
separate
sovereignties.
the
injustice
to
him
is
the
same.
from
his
standpoint,
it
is
the
same.
and
it
is
my
contention
that
both
on
reason
and
on
authority,
the
two
--
the
two
situations
should
be
treated
in
the
same
way.
now,
the
english
common
law
authorities
are
clearly
and
flatly
on
our
side.
as
early
as
1678,
it
was
settled
in
the
leading
case
of
rex
against
hutchinson,
on
our
brief
at
page
40,
that
a
man
acquitted
in
portugal
could
not
be
tried
again
in
england.
and
there
are
other
--
other
cases
just
as
strong.
our
brief
cites
them
and
also
american
colonial
materials.
now,
there's
quite
a
number
of
state
and
lower
federal
court
cases
against
us
but
they
do
not
seem
at
all
persuasive
and
neither
or
certain
dicta
of
this
court.
and
as
for
the
dicta
of
this
court,
their
expressions
of
this
court
also
on
our
side
and
in
our
brief,
we
analyzed
those
and
fully
discussed
them.
we
discussed
the
liquor
prohibition
case
of
united
states
against
lanza
decided
in
1922
which
is
a
weak
and
distinguishable
case.
it
is
exclusively
argued
as
a
construction
of
the
volstead
act
and
the
court,
in
dealing
with
the
constitutional
question,
considered
only
the
effect
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
clause
which
gives
the
states
concurrent
jurisdiction,
concurrent
power
to
enforce.
and
this
concurrent
power
to
enforce
didn't
occur
to
that
phrase.
it
occurs
nowhere
else
in
the
constitution,
and
it's
now
out
of
the
constitution.
furthermore,
in
lanza,
there
had
been
a
prior
conviction.
it
wasn't
an
acquittal
and
the
case
has
been
severely
criticized
by
professor
grant
in
his
article
that
accompanies
our
brief
by
professor
wexler.
the
american
law
institute
is
against
it.
now,
in
this
lanza
case
furthermore,
the
vital
common
law
authorities
were
not
mentioned
in
the
briefs.
i've
read
them.
and
the
case
has
other
weaknesses
that
i'll
go
into
in
the
brief.
for
one
thing,
the
first
trial
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
a
jury
trial
which
has
an
application
that
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment.
it's
clear
that
the
issue
of
whether
the
one
jurisdiction
can
retry
a
man
acquitted
by
the
other
is
still
an
open
question
for
this
court.
now,
once
lanza
is
eliminated,
the
only
remaining
argument
for
double
trials
is
that
the
federal-state
relationship
requires
it.
the
argument
implies
that
expediency
and
the
practicalities
of
american
federalism
require
us
to
do
something
that
is
otherwise
constitutionally
treated
as
an
injustice
and
something
which
england
and
france,
for
example,
will
not
do
as
between
foreign
countries.
now,
i
propose
to
show
that
not
only
does
american
federalism
not
require
such
a
shameful
result
but
that
in
practice
and
policy,
federal-state
relations
would
be
improved
if
it
would
--
do
not
--
if
you
don't
have
it,
it
actually
be
harmed
by
the
extension
of
any
such
rule.
the
heart
of
the
argument,
of
course,
is
that
unless
the
state
is
allowed
to
relitigate
federal
criminal
judgments,
the
federal
government
would
equally
be
prevented
from
relitigating
state
judgments
and
that
would
be
a
limitation
on
the
federal
judicial
power.
now,
we
think
--
i
think
the
rule
ought
to
work
both
ways,
state
and
federal
and
federal
and
state.
but
we
do
not
agree
that
the
federal
government
can
or
should
try
a
man
over
again
who's
been
acquitted
by
the
state.
for
one
thing,
the
seventh
amendment
prevents
it,
at
least
if
the
man
was
tried
by
a
jury,
and
that's
why
i
alluded
to
the
fact
that
i
can't
find
any
evidence
that
in
lanza,
the
man
was
tried
by
the
state
of
washington
jury.
but
those
are
jury
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
petitioner
was
acquitted
by
a
jury.
in
this
connection,
i
refer
to
the
second
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment
which
is
a
relatively
unfamiliar
part
of
it.
unfamiliar
at
least,
as
i
judge,
because
they're
--
how
do
you
know
a
case
is
on
it?
here's
what
it
says,
i'll
read
it.
"no
fact
tried
by
a
jury
should
be
otherwise
reexamined
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
than
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law."
so
the
man
can't
be
retried
anyway
by
the
federal
government
if
he
had
a
jury
trial.
so,
we
don't
need
to
protect
--
we
don't
need
to
perpetuate
this
injustice
or
extend
it
in
order
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
retry
a
man
because
the
seventh
amendment
prevents
him
from
being
retried
anyway.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
the
seventh
amendment
is
generally
entitled
in
the
manuals,
civil
trials.
that
was
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no,
almost
all
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
this
court
has
found,
your
honor,
that
the
second
clause
is
a
substantial
and
independent
clause.
but
let's
suppose
that
it
only
applies
to
civil
trials,
and
i'll
now
accept
that
for
the
purposes
of
further
discussion.
i
don't
agree
with
it
but
in
view
of
what
this
court
has
said,
it
would
be
an
independent
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
i
don't
agree
with
it
but
i'll
accept
it
and
say
it
only
applies
to
civil
trials,
but
look
where
this
brings
us.
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
when
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted,
the
jury
verdicts
in
criminal
cases
who
intended
to
be
given
less
protection
than
in
civil
cases.
and
certainly
at
that
time,
the
general
public
sentiment
was
at
least
as
much
concerned
with
criminal
matters
as
with
civil.
therefore,
if
the
second
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment
fails
to
include
criminal
trials,
it
could
hardly
be
because
our
ancestors
intended
that
state
criminal
jury
verdicts
should
be
subject
to
reexamination
in
federal
courts.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
there
was
--
they're
in
the
original
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
in
the
original
constitution
also
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
there
was
a
lot
of
effort
to
protect
property
rights
and
vested
rights.
but,
when
they
came
around
to
adopting
the
bill
of
rights,
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot
and
at
that
time,
it
would
not
have
been
at
all
popular
to
suggest
it
that
--
that
criminal
verdicts
could
be
reexamined.
but
even
--
but
take
on
reason,
holmes
said
for
unanimous
court
in
the
oppenheimer
case,
it
cannot
be
that
the
safeguards
of
the
person
are
less
than
the
safeguards
that
protect
from
a
liability
in
debt
and
stoll
against
gottlieb
in
305
united
states
with
the
same
effect.
if
the
second
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment
is,
by
any
possibility,
applicable
only
to
civil
trials,
it
must
have
been
because
everybody
assumed
that
the
reexamination
of
state
criminal
verdicts
was
forbidden
elsewhere
in
the
constitution
and
there
was
a
plain
clause
in
there
to
which
that
construction
could
readily
be
given,
namely,
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
in
its
inescapable
inference
from
the
second
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment
that
a
federal
retrial
after
a
state
acquittal
is
unconstitutional.
we
have
some
historical
materials
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
support
this
to
some
extent.
so
even
if
this
court
is
not
convinced
by
this
argument
based
on
the
seventh
amendment,
i
submit
that
it
is
unsound
federalism
to
call
another
jury
of
illinois
citizens
to
try
a
man
over
again
who
has
been
acquitted
by
one
jury
of
illinois
citizens.
that
would
be
that
in
order
to
prevent
the
exceptional
case
of
an
individual
going
free
after
one
inadequate
trial
as
the
judge
thought
it
was
inadequate
in
this
case,
it
would
make
a
rule
that
everybody
is
subject
to
two
real
trials
and
that
is
not
the
way
to
promote
respect
for
our
principles
in
our
courts.
and
there
are
other
and
better
ways
in
protecting
federal
jurisdiction.
congress
can
always
take
over
the
field
to
a
greater
or
less
extent.
there
is
always
federal
preemption.
the
only
purpose
of
a
federal
retrial
is
to
assert
federal
supremacy.
and
the
normal
way
to
do
this,
the
normal
constitutional
way
to
do
it
is
through
the
preemption
power
and
the
resources
of
federal
preemption
or
ample
and
manifold.
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
congress
to
take
over
the
whole
of
any
field.
that's
not
an
attractive
remedy.
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
a
great
part
of
our
constitutional
system.
but
there
could
be
easily
be
a
partial
preemption.
for
example,
the
congress
might
provide
that
a
state
couldn't
prosecute
for
federal
bank
robbery
until,
say,
30
days
after
notifying
the
united
states
attorney,
so
that
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
proceed
first.
that
would
produce
only
one
trial
and
would
preserve
federal
supremacy.
there's
no
reason
for
worrying
about
loosing
anything
by
depriving
the
federal
government
of
the
right
to
try
a
man,
an
--
an
acquitted
man
over
again.
in
our
brief,
we
cite
materials
to
show
that
double
prosecutions
are
not
favored
by
either
the
states
or
the
nation.
the
american
law
institute
is
against
them
and
most
people
don't
think
they
can
take
place
when
the
--
when
the
statute
against
interstate
transportation
of
automobiles
to
direct
was
passed
and
that
was
a
few
years
before
lanza.
the
original
draft
contained
a
section
prohibiting
double
prosecutions.
but
mr.
dyer
(ph)
explained
to
congress
that
where
a
man
has
been
tried
upon
the
merits
in
a
criminal
matter
and
the
case
has
been
disposed
of,
why,
is
not
a
bar
anyway
to
further
prosecution
and
they
left
it
out.
while
the
state
and
the
nation
are
separate
sovereignties,
they're
not
separate
like
foreign
countries.
suppose
a
man
shot
across
a
state
line,
now,
in
other
cases
to
the
effect
that
an
acquittal
or
conviction
in
one
state
is
not
a
bar
to
a
prosecution
in
the
other
but
that
is
not
the
view
of
justice
brewer
of
this
court,
who,
for
a
unanimous
court
in
1909
said,
"where
an
act
is
malum
in
se
prohibited
and
punishable
by
the
laws
of
both
states,
the
one
first
acquiring
jurisdiction
of
the
person
may
prosecute
the
offense,
and
its
judgement
is
a
finality
in
both
states,
so
that
one
convicted,"
i'm
still
quoting,
"so
that
one
convicted
or
acquitted
in
the
courts
of
the
one
state
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
the
same
offense
in
the
courts
of
the
other.”
now,
that
was
dictum.
but
this
court
has
never
held
to
the
contrary.
and
we
submit
that
it
expresses
the
proper
rule
for
all
situations
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
different
states
or
between
the
states
and
the
nation.
and
that
is
the
--
is
the
rule
of
sound
federalism
that
congress
protect
the
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
supremacy
clause
in
any
one
of
the
manifold
number
of
cases.
we
show
in
our
brief
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
nielsen
against
oregon,
213
u.s.
115.
that's
a
fish
trap
case
involving
commercial
fishing
in
the
columbia
river.
we
show
in
our
brief
how
the
smooth
workings
of
the
federal-state
relationship
would
be
enhanced
by
recognition
of
the
rule
of
no
retrials.
the
cooperation
has
now
reached
the
point
where
due
to
the
fingerprinting
work
of
the
fbi,
fingerprinting
and
the
fbi
laboratories
which
of
the
service
of
every
police
departments
throughout
the
state
is
a
joint
effort.
and
if
your
honors
remember
a
case
in
this
court
last
spring
where
the
cooperation
is
so
complete,
that
a
chicago
policeman
went
in
the
man's
car
and
was
trailed
by
two
narcotics,
they
are
federal
narcotics
agents
all
by
prearrangement.
my
time
is
--
is
going
to
a
close,
your
honors,
but
i
want
to
mention
my
third
point.
i
will
not
argue
now
because
i
haven't
time
anymore
than
i
have,
these
federal
officers
point,
but
it's
--
it's
fully
set
forth
in
the
brief.
our
third
major
ground
for
reversal
is
completely
independent
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
is
that
retrial
by
a
state
after
a
judgement
of
acquittal
by
a
federal
court
is
an
unconstitutional
encroachment
on
the
federal
judicial
power.
but
this
point
was
not
argued
below,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
this
court,
on
its
own
motion,
may
wish
to
consider
it
for
its
own
value
and
also
it's
really
relevant
because
it
shows
what
a
serious
box
we
will
be
in
if
the
defense
of
former
acquittal
is
not
sustained
here.
now,
here
is
the
point
in
the
word.
after
a
federal
court
has
tried
a
man
and
acquitted
him,
is
it
not
a
mockery
of
the
federal
judicial
power
for
the
state
to
retry
him
for
the
same
offense
and
reverse
the
decision?
if
lanza
is
not
limited
by
the
present
case,
the
states
will
be
invited
to
engage
in
the
general
practice
of
trying
people
over
again
on
the
same
accusation
which
they've
been
acquitted
in
the
federal
courts.
they've
made
--
many
prosecutors
may
feel
it's
their
unwelcome
duty
to
do
it.
the
states
may
create
state
offenses
exactly
paralleling
federal
offenses.
finality
of
judgement
is
an
essential
attribute
of
judicial
power
and
if
--
within
the
situation
i
have
suggested
that
--
that
occurred,
finality
of
judgement
would
be
gone
and
that
judicial
power
has
been
occupied
by
legislation.
congress
has
already
acted
to
give
the
federal
courts
authority
to
exercise
the
federal
judicial
power
to
prevent
this
violation.
section
1738
of
the
judicial
code
requires
the
states
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
federal
judicial
proceedings.
in
section
1651,
authorizes
this
court
to
issue
its
writ
of
mandate
to
protect
and
effectuate
the
federal
judgment
that
was
entered
below.
in
short,
a
reversal
here
was
required
if
--
for
no
other
reason
than
to
protect
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
judicial
power.
if
i
have
a
few
more
moments,
i'd
like
to
save
them
for
rebuttal,
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
irrespective
of
who
initiated
this
proceeding,
the
federal
agents
did
not
merely
testify
in
the
state
court,
they
proceeded
to
prepare
the
case,
the
interview
of
witnesses
and,
as
i
have
said,
they
dug
up
a
new
witness.
they
continued
in
their
official
capacities
to
carry
on
what
i
understand
is
forbidden
by
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment,
so
much
for
that.
as
for
the
case
of
palko,
palko
only
approved
the
second
trial
in
the
same
proceeding
and
where
illegal
error
came
in
the
first
trial.
in
other
words,
palko
held
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
appeal
and
obtain
for
itself
one
errorless
trial
but
it
was
expressly
--
it
was
expressly
accepted
in
the
palko
case,
the
--
the
--
any
decision
on
the
matter
before
there
was
a
new
and
different
proceeding.
and
if
ordered
liberty
means
anything,
it
means
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
just
orderly
than
to
have
relitigation
of
completed
cases
in
which
a
final
judgment
has
been
entered.
now,
the
case
of
parker
against
mcclure
that
mr.
wines
referred
to
is
like
so
many
cases
both
in
this
court
and
other
courts
on
this
question
that
are
said
to
be
against
us.
they
are
not
double
jeopardy
cases
at
all.
it
was
only
one
trial.
it
was
simply
dicta
useful
for
argument
in
the
one
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
thank
you
for
your
expression,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
reargument
of
a
criminal
case
that
was
argued
here
last
november.
it
involves
issues
of
double
jeopardy
and
federal
state
relations.
i
represent
the
petitioner.
he's
a
prisoner
in
the
illinois
penitentiary
where
he's
now
served
four
years
of
a
life
sentence
for
bank
robbery.
this
court
granted
his
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
illinois
supreme
court's
affirmance
of
his
conviction
and
appointed
counsel
for
him.
our
principal
contention
is
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
not
accorded
petitioner
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
due
process
was
disregarded,
we
submit,
in
more
than
one
way,
in
several
quite
different
ways,
each
one
of
which
justifies
reversal.
the
procedural
facts
surrounding
this
trial
are
not
creditable
to
american
justice.
the
two
most
critical
issues
are,
first,
that
illinois
tried
him
over
again
after
he'd
been
acquitted
by
a
federal
court.
and
second,
which
is
entirely
separate
and
independent
ground
is
that
illinois
convicted
him
on
the
basis
of
the
unconstitutional
activities
of
federal
officers.
here
are
the
facts,
and
they
are
not
disputed.
in
1953,
a
savings
and
loan
association
of
cook
county
was
robbed
by
two
armed
men.
they
took
about
$4000
and
escaped
in
a
car.
the
driver
was
waiting
in
the
car.
petitioner
was
then
26
years
old,
heard
that
he
was
wanted.
and
he
went
to
the
united
states
marshals
office.
and
there,
he
was
arrested
and
charged
for
being
the
driver
of
the
car.
and
his
defense
was
they
have
the
wrong
man.
at
the
trial,
the
identity
of
the
driver
of
the
car
was
the
only
issue.
petitioner
took
the
stand,
and
he
and
other
witnesses
testified
he
was
far
away
from
the
place
at
the
time
the
robbery
occurred.
and
the
testimony
against
him
was
by
alleged
accomplices.
this
trial
was
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
and
for
violation
of
the
federal
bank
robbery
statute.
and
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
was,
of
course,
that
the
institution
which
had
been
robbed
was
insured
for
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
94%
of
all
savings
and
loan
institutions
in
this
country
are
federally
insured.
and
the
existence
of
this
insurance
was
stipulated.
petitioner
was
found
not
guilty
by
the
federal
jury
and
was
acquitted
as
a
final
end
of
that
case.
now,
we
come
to
the
activities
of
the
federal
officers.
in
spite
of
petitioner's
acquittal
by
the
federal
court,
the
federal
government
kept
on
working
for
his
conviction.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
his
alleged
accomplices
pleaded
guilty
and
later
on
were
sentenced.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
(inaudible)
trivial
sentences.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
don't
know
whether
that's
in
the
full
transcript,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
but
this
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
these
aren't
the
state
--
the
opinion
of
the
state
of
illinois,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
summarizes
the
facts.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no.
the
--
the
record
of
the
federal
trial
was
never
introduced
into
evidence.
but
there
was
no
dispute
about
it
at
all.
it
was
the
--
the
facts
were
all
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
it
was
assumed
what
transpired
at
the
federal
trial,
the
same
evidence
roughly
was
--
was
presented
and
it
was
the
same
thing
over
again.
now,
the
state's
attorney
of
cook
county
said
on
the
record
that
the
federal
authorities
came
to
him
after
petitioner's
federal
acquittal.
petitioner
was
then
turned
over
immediately
to
state
custody
and
he
was
indicted
the
second
time
for
this
same
robbery.
now,
the
fbi
agents
in
this
regard,
as
we
contend,
of
the
double-jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment,
interviewed
one
of
petitioner's
alibi
witnesses
and
turned
over
the
information
to
the
state
authorities.
they
kept
on
working
up
the
case.
a
special
agent
and
the
united
states
attorney
also
interviewed
an
entirely
new
witness,
a
man
who
had
not
testified
in
the
previous
case.
and
they
were
the
ones
that
asked
this
new
witness
to
come
into
the
state
court
and
testify.
and
the
federal
agent
did
the
interviewing.
so
after
the
--
after
the
federal
acquittal,
final
federal
acquittal,
the
illinois
prosecutor
didn't
talk
with
this
new
witness
until
the
day
he
examined
him
at
the
state
trial.
as
i
said,
this
activity
is
an
independent
ground
of
reversal
separate
from
the
former
acquittal
point.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
the
statements,
yes.
in
the
record
--
the
record
as
submitted
to
this
court
is
transmitted
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
does
not
contain
the
statements
of
--
of
the
trial
judge
--
the
federal
trial
judge
in
--
in
making
statements
that
encouraged
this
prosecution.
we
--
we
added
to
our
brief
newspaper
clippings
and
a
clipping
from
the
federal
reporter.
in
another
case,
entirely
different
case,
and
this
was
discussed
in
the
federal
reporter
in
order
to
justify
this
court
taking
judicial
notice
of
--
of
the
wide
notoriety
that
the
federal
judge's
action
had
here.
the
wide
notoriety
was
given
this
action
in
encouraging
the
second
trial.
this
is
additional.
we
think
that
the
facts
in
the
record
that
i've
already
given
fully
support
our
contention
about
the
activities
of
the
federal
officers.
this
interviewing
of
the
witnesses
are
all
in
the
record.
but
this
part
about
what
the
federal
judge
did
is
not
in
the
record
but
it's
described
and
i
say
the
way
that
we
--
it
was
and
we
submit
that
if
this
court
cares
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it
as
additional
explanation
of
how
this
man
happened
to
be
gone
after
in
this
way.
now,
our
point
is,
of
course,
that
the
federal
officers
utilized
the
state
court
as
their
instrument
in
doing
what
the
federal
government
has
forbidden
to
do
by
the
double-jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
not
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
we're
not
arguing
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
taking
over
in
toto
by
the
fourteenth
at
all.
now,
the
issue
in
this
second
state
trial
was
the
same
as
that
in
the
first
trial.
and
that
issue
was
the
identity
of
the
person
driving
the
car
used
in
the
escape.
and
petitioner
was
found
guilty
in
the
second
case,
as
the
one
in
the
illinois
state
court.
now,
the
reason
why
he
got
life
imprisonment
for
this
was
because
it
was
automatically
mandatory
under
the
illinois
second
offender
statute
which
was
then
enforced
in
illinois.
and
that
statute
provided,
as
the
statutes
do
in
a
number
of
states,
your
honors
no
doubt
know,
that
a
prior
conviction
in
a
different
case
be
mentioned
in
the
indictment
and
brought
to
attention
of
the
jury.
if
you
want
to
use
--
if
you
want
to
use
the
second
offender
statute,
you've
got
to
put
it
in
the
--
in
the
indictment
and
put
it
to
the
jury.
now,
that
feature
of
the
statute
has,
i
am
very
glad
to
say,
been
repealed
since
my
client's
conviction
and
illinois
is
no
longer
in
the
position
where
juries
have
got
to
be
told
about
previous
offenses.
but
the
repeal
is
not
retroactive.
and
in
our
brief,
we
raised
that
an
independent
ground
of
reversal
what
we
regard
as
an
extremely
unfair
application
of
that
statute
to
this
case
and
i
won't
argue
it
orally
but
it
is.
the
petitioner
wasn't
even
allowed
to
introduce
evidence
of
his
own
acquittal
in
rebuttal.
i
want
to
argue
today
will
only
be
the
time,
three
grounds
of
reversal.
the
first,
the
petitioner
was
tried
over
again
after
being
acquitted,
and
second,
the
unconstitutional
participation
of
the
federal
officers,
and
third,
encroachment
by
the
state
of
illinois
on
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
in
holding
at
naught
an
--
an
acquittal
by
a
federal
court.
now,
our
first
point,
it's
undisputed
that
the
only
difference
between
the
second
trial
and
the
first
trial
was
the
jurisdictional
difference.
by
which
i
mean
the
first
trial
was
in
a
federal
court,
the
second
trial
in
a
state
court.
now,
this
difference
in
sovereignties
has
sometimes
been
thought
to
permit
double
prosecutions.
but
that
is,
as
i
proposed
to
show,
an
open
question
for
this
court.
we
contend
that
from
the
standpoint
of
due
process
that
that
difference
in
sovereignties
is
not
of
a
nature
to
justify
a
second
trial
for
what
was
in
fact
the
same
offense.
in
short,
the
due
process
is
a
matter
of
substance.
now,
our
whole
case
is
based
in
this
angle
of
this
point
on
the
premise
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
state
of
illinois
may
not
by
itself
keep
on
prosecuting
a
man
after
he's
been
acquitted.
i
mean
over
and
over
again
under
the
same
statute.
now,
of
course,
it's
well
established,
the
federal
government
cannot
do
that.
it
can't
do
it
by
itself.
you
can't
have
successive
federal
prosecutions.
but
the
fifth
amendment
provisions
are,
of
course,
binding
only
on
the
federal
government,
except,
except
that
they
may
be
so
essential
to
ordered
liberty
as
to
be
part
of
due
process.
we
contend
that
the
inviability
of
a
former
acquittal
is
so
fundamental
as
to
be
part
of
due
process
of
law.
you
see,
our
position
in
this
case
is
based
on
the
defense
of
former
acquittal,
goes
way
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
common
law
and
not
on
the
concept
of
double-jeopardy
as
a
whole
which
includes
a
good
many
other
things
that
are
not
binding
on
the
states
and
have
been
so
held
not
to
be
binding
by
this
court.
there's
an
analogy
of
this
that
justice
cardozo
made
in
palko
case
in
the
field
of
self-incrimination.
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
binding
on
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
not
all
of
it,
not
the
whole
privilege.
yet,
self-incrimination
by
forced
confession
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
that's
just
an
analogy.
now,
in
hoag
--
in
hoag
against
new
jersey,
which
was
decided
last
may,
this
court
indicated
that
there
are
situations,
not
that
case,
there
are
situations
of
fundamental
unfairness
where
consecutive
trials
by
a
state
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
of
greater
unfairness
than
where
a
man
is
tried
over
again
after
a
judicial
proceeding
has
finally
terminated
and
a
jury
verdict
then
with
a
final
judgment
for
the
court
that
he
was
innocent.
it's
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
destructive
of
ordered
liberty.
it
would
be
destructive
of
judicial
order.
in
our
brief,
we
give
material
to
show
how
deeply
the
sanctity
of
former
acquittal
is
embedded
in
the
history
of
anglo-american
law
as
it
is
in
the
law
of
all
of
that
systems
in
--
around
the
world.
becket's
controversy
with
henry
ii
established
that
the
man
acquitted
by
the
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
could
not
be
tried
over
again.
a
convicted
man
could
be
given
additional
punishment
by
the
civil
authorities,
a
convicted
man.
but
the
defense
of
former
acquittal,
a
man
who
had
been
adjudicated
innocent,
could
not
be.
and
i
am
sure
that
illinois
will
not
contend
that
when
a
man
has
been
acquitted
in
--
in
illinois,
it
can
try
him
over
again
for
identically
the
same
offense.
and
today,
i'm
going
to
assume
we're
going
to
that
quite
fully
in
our
brief.
but
today,
i'll
assume
that
that
is
clear
beyond
doubt.
that's
our
premise.
and
that
leaves
only
the
question
of
federal
state
relationship,
namely,
this
is
the
question,
if
state
and
nation
are
each
forbidden
to
have
two
trials
of
the
man,
can
they
nevertheless
do
it
in
combination?
those
are
divisions
of
sovereignties.
and
of
course,
it's
really
a
division
of
one
national
sovereignty
between
our
--
our
state
and
our
federal
sovereignty.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
in
substance,
these
are
the
same.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
there's
a
verbal
differences
in
the
statutes.
we've
explained
in
our
brief.
there
are
verbal
differences
in
the
statutes
and
in
the
federal
case,
they
had
to
prove
that
the
building
--
that
the
savings
and
loan
association
had
been
insured
by
the
federal
savings
and
loan
association
--
federal
savings
and
loan
corporation,
insurance
corporation
and
i
have
stipulated
that
was
so
and
a
separate
fact
that
had
to
be
proved.
it's
very
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
otherwise
the
proof
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
otherwise
the
proof
required
was
the
same.
it's
a
separate
fact
which
--
but
the
same
fact
would
exist,
take
this
example,
it's
a
separate
offense
under
the
federal
bank
robbery
statute
to
rob
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
the
separate
offense
from
robbing
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
well,
that's
the
kind
of
difference
this
is.
can
you
try
a
man
twice
for
the
same
thing
once
because
that
offense
includes
the
separate
fact
you
have
to
prove
he
--
that
the
robbed
the
institution
was
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
the
next
time,
the
entirely
separate
fact
that
it
was
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
that's
stipulated.
it's
only
a
question
of
definition
of
the
offense.
and
that
--
there
are
expressions
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
--
that
indicate
and
they
have
to
do
with
other
circumstances.
but
there
are
general
statements
to
say
that
if
the
fact,
that
the
separate
fact
required
for
the
approval
of
the
statute,
that
makes
it
a
separate
offense.
and
i
am
just
trying
to
say
that
that
certainly
shouldn't
be
taken
to
be
so
in
all
cases
because
i'm
quite
certain
that
this
court
would
never
spend
for
a
man
being
tried
twice
for
the
same
offense,
once
because
for
the
same
affair,
the
same
robbery,
once
because
it
was
--
the
--
the
institution
insures
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
once
because
he
is
a
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i'll
explain
myself,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
he
shouldn't
be
tried
over
again
if
he'd
been
convicted
anymore
than
if
he'd
been
acquitted.
but
nevertheless,
there
is
a
--
a
definite
difference
and
the
court
may
feel
differently
about
this
because
there
are
authorities
which
we
showed
in
our
--
our
argument,
that
we
show
in
our
brief,
we
showed
there
is
a
decided
difference
between
acquittal
and
conviction.
i
don't
think
the
man
ought
to
be
tried
over
again
in
either
case.
now,
there
are
many
other
things
that
double-jeopardy
demands.
for
you
to
consider
double-jeopardy
arises
as
soon
as
the
jury
has
been
sworn,
that
kind
of
thing,
and
that
does
not
prevent
a
man
from
being
tried
over
again.
whether
he
should
be
tried
over
again
after
he's
been
convicted
is
a
separate
question
from
our
case.
it's
not
our
case.
and
i
think
i
expressed
my
opinion
on
that.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
--
it's
a
different
interest
or
not
but
if
the
federal
government
has
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
i
understand.
if
the
federal
government
has
an
interest
sufficient
to
allow
it
to
regulate
--
regulate
banking,
then
the
state
institution
is
sufficiently
related
to
banking
to
enable
the
regulation
to
be
sustained.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that
i
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
to
that
i
suppose
is
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
constitutional
power
of
the
federal
government
over
banking.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
but
that
is
not
the
specific
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
mr.
justice,
you're
asking
question
very
close
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
all
have
thought
alike
and
--
and
actually,
i
expect
to
--
we'll
do
it
and
will
--
and
will
deal
it
once
with
it
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
with
it
right
now.
the
--
that
must
always,
i
assume,
mr.
justice,
the
--
a
separate
federal
purpose
of
a
statute
or
else
there
could
not
be
a
constitutional
law
passed
under
it.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
this
is
the
--
i'm
--
i
said
the
purpose
of
the
constitutional
grant
of
jurisdiction.
but
once
you
have
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
as
over
interstate
commerce,
as
we
can
see
somewhat
by
referring
to
this
previous
case,
once
you
got
that
grant,
then
the
court
never
looks
in
to
the
question
of
whether
that
particular
statute
has
that
purpose
or
whether
it's
related
to
the
other
purpose.
i'll
give
a
very
good
example
is
--in
--
field
of
interstate
commerce
is
the
mann
act.
the
mann
act
was
supported
because
of
interstate
commerce
and
makes
it
a
crime
to
transport
a
woman
for
the
purposes
of
prostitution
across
state
line
of
course.
now,
the
state
of
--
of
illinois
and
the
state
of
new
york
also
have
statutes
prohibiting
the
importation
of
women
across
state
lines
for
purposes
of
--
of
prostitution.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
purposes
of
those
statutes
are
different.
the
purposes
of
those
statutes
are
just
the
same.
the
purposes
are
to
prevent
prostitution.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
each
has
a
separate
share.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
certainly.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
each
certainly
can.
the
--
the
question
here
is
whether
each
certainly
can
in
all
areas
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
that's
all
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
because
that's
all
that
you
can
get
for
double
trial.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
the
federal
government
preempts
the
federal
field.
that
of
course
that
ends
the
possibility
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
of
duplicate,
that
ends
the
possibility
of
duplicate
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
cases.
and
that
is
one
of
the
--
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
against
this
asserted
practice
of
duplicate
prosecution,
this
it
tends
to
cause
this
court
to
lean
a
little
tort
preemption
but
otherwise
wouldn't
because
it
thereby
prevents
this
injustice
that
thereby
prevent
this
injustice
of
successive
prosecutions.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
oh,
absolutely
not.
we
would
insist
that
there's
been
no
preemption.
it
would
be
preposterous
to
say
there'd
been
preemption
of
the
field
of
--
of
federal
bank
robbery.
federal
bank
robbery
could
be
taken
over
by
the
federal
--
by
congress.
but
it
hasn't
done
so
and
it's
highly
unlikely
that
it
would
do
so
and
we
certainly
don't
contend
that
here
at
all.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
the
main
--
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
immediate
differences
between
the
hoag
case
and
this
case
is
that
in
the
hoag
case,
there
were
two
victims.
the
man
was
tried
the
first
time
for
robbing
one
man
or
--
or
two
--
two
men
or
three
men,
and
the
last
time
for
robbing
somebody
different.
here
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
at
the
same
time.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
but
that
has
been
thought
to
make
a
difference
in
allowing
other
cases
besides
the
hoag
case.
there
--
there
are
authorities
that
indicate
that
makes
a
difference.
but
our
man,
my
client
is
accused
of
only
one
undifferentiated
robbery
of
the
same
people.
this
is
unfragmented,
undifferentiated.
the
--
the
whole
case
also
is
the
question
of
collateral
estoppel
was
what
it
really
seemed
to
rest
on
and
--
and
that
is
the
--
the
case
is
--
is
much
less
strong
than
in
this
case
for
those
reasons.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
it's
the
same
person,
the
same
man.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
i'm
going
to
talk
a
lot
about
that.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
of
course,
if
--
even
if
the
state
and
nation
doing
it
together
would
be
a
terrible
violation
of
ancient
principle
and
a
violation
of
due
process
and
of
everything
else,
still
--
still
is
such
a
gap
in
the
regular
constitutional
protection
is
really
necessary
to
the
practical
operation
of
our
american
system
we
must,
of
course,
endure
it
however
greater
violation
of
constitutional
principle
it
may
be.
that
--
that
argument
has
been
made
for
a
number
of
very
serious
and
important
things.
for
example,
the
power
of
this
court
to
declare
acts
of
congress
and
statutes
unconstitutional
which
isn't
in
the
constitution.
but
any
--
any
such
exception
to
basic
principle
should
be
reserved
for
absolutely
essential
things.
and
it
is
--
it
is
for
this
court
to
determine
whether
it
is
necessary
to
the
practical
operation
of
american
federalism
to
allow
this
thing
where,
by
hypothesis,
both
the
state
and
the
nation
of
acting
alone
are
forbidden
to
try
the
man
over
again.
the
man's
--
the
--
the
defense
of
former
acquittal
is
for
the
protection
of
the
accused
protection
from
the
intolerable
abuse,
the
intolerable
abuse,
double
prosecution.
there
is
need
of
the
protection
is
identically
the
same
whether
the
successive
prosecutions
or
by
the
same
or
by
different
sovereignties.
from
this
standpoint,
the
two
situations
are
of
the
same
nature.
one
is
as
bad
as
the
other
and
the
injustice
is
the
same.
and
the
only
possible
argument
you
can
urge
for
is
that
it's
necessary
to
our
whole
federalism
and
that
we
propose
to
show
isn't
so
at
all
but
nothing
remotely
approaching
such
a
necessity
exists
in
this
case
and
in
fact,
it
balances
the
other
way.
a
lot
of
materials
in
our
brief
would
indicate
that
federal
state
relationship
and
cooperation
would
be
improved
by
--
by
eliminating
any
chance
of
successive
prosecutions.
now,
our
case
here,
although
it
involves
the
most
important
constitutional
question,
has
is
--
is
a
case
where
the
issue
was
a
narrow
one,
narrower
than
you
might
at
first
realize.
we're
only
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
successive
trials
by
state
and
nation
around
the
statute
so
alike
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
them.
and
our
case
is
where
the
difference
in
jurisdiction
is
the
only
thing
that
is
alleged
to
make
it
two
offenses
of
getting
around
to
the
question
of
--
again
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked.
the
double-jeopardy
problem
that
we
have
in
our
case
is
not
reached
in
those
numerous
cases
where
the
gist
of
a
federal
statute
is
different
from
the
gist
of
the
state
statute.
see,
i'm
talking
about
cases
in
contrast
with
the
mann
act
example
i
gave.
i'm
talking
about
cases
where
the
statutes
have
different
purposes
and
protect
different
interests.
now,
that
is
the
issue
in
the
abbate
case,
number
7,
which
is
going
to
be
argued
tomorrow.
there,
the
solicitor
general
says
in
his
brief
that
the
federal
and
the
state
statutes
protect
different
interests,
and
i'm
talking
about
protecting
really
--
really
different
interests,
sir,
and
not
--
and
not
the
general
purpose
of
congress
being
given
the
jurisdictional
power
by
the
constitution
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
oh,
yes,
surely.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
not
to
protect
federal
funds
at
all.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
set
forth
fully
in
our
brief
and
it
shows
that
the
gravamen
of
the
two
statutes
is
exactly
the
same.
it
shows
that
the
federal
bank
robbery
statute
was
concerned
exclusively
with
enforcement
with
using
the
federal
jurisdictional
basis
to
provide
federal
enforcement
facilities,
the
fbi
for
example.
the
house
report
said
that
the
federal
government
“will
intervene
only
to
--
will
intervene
only
to
cooperate
with
local
forces
when
it
is
evident
the
latter
cannot
cope
with
the
criminals”.
the
purpose
of
this
was
not
to
protect
federal
funds
and
maybe
that
was
part
of
the
purpose
of
congress
having
the
power
over
banking.
but
--
but
the
procedure
and
method
of
this
court
has
never
been
to
test
this
purpose
of
each
--
of
each
statute
by
that
means.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no,
of
course,
not.
they
used
the
jurisdictional
basis
to
put
the
protection
there.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
correct.
certainly,
certainly,
i
agree.
but
in
our
case,
whatever
the
basis
or
purpose
of
federal
jurisdiction
over
banking
institutions
may
be,
the
federal
bank
robbery
statute
proceeds
by
way
of
protecting
the
bank.
its
purpose
is
to
protect
the
bank
just
like
the
state
statute.
my
purpose
is
that
when
--
that
you
--
my
point
is
that
you
--
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
statutes.
there's
one
kind
where
they
protect
different
--
different
interests.
that's
like
the
situation
of
selling
liquor
to
a
minor
on
sunday
where
successive
prosecutions
are
warranted.
and
here's
an
example
in
the
--
in
our
field.
a
state
prosecution
for
assault
or
murder,
a
state
prosecution
for
assault
or
murder
would
not
bar
subsequent
federal
prosecution
for
violation
of
the
civil
right
to
vote
because
the
federal
policy
is
different
from
a
state
policy.
but
even
if
there's
this
--
even
if
there's
this
--
this
difference
in
all
of
the
purpose
of
the
jurisdiction,
mr.
justice
stewart,
where
they're
so
close
together
that
the
statute
does
not
proceed
by
having
any
other
purpose
than
the
immediate
purpose
of
stopping
prostitution
in
the
--
in
the
mann
act
case
in
the
case
of,
take,
transporting
women
across
state
lines.
we
contend
that
in
those
cases,
this
court
must
find
that
there
is
no
constitutional
substance
in
that
difference
for
purposes
of
permitting
successive
prosecutions.
the
--
the
former
acquittal
plea
is
a
violation
--
is
a
--
is
it
must
be
asserted
to
protect
due
process,
must
be
supported
to
protect
due
process
under
those
circumstances.
otherwise,
you
make
a
mockery
of
this
--
of
the
whole
situation.
now,
take
a
case
--
i'll
tell
you
a
good
case.
last
--
last
session
of
this
court
was
a
case
that
upheld
the
assimilative
crimes
act
which
automatically
brought
into
--
under
a
federal
jurisdiction
of
state
--
of
state
crimes.
now,
suppose
you
have
a
--
an
enclave,
an
indian
reservation
say
which
is
the
one
in
that
early
oregon
that
--
that's
mentioned
in
some
of
our
briefs
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
now,
there,
a
state
crime
automatically
becomes
a
federal
crime.
now,
i
submit
that
it
would
be
shocking
to
permit
successive
prosecutions
permit
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
to
carrying
off
and
have
successive
prosecutions
on
the
theory
that
one
offense
was
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
united
states
and
the
other
was
an
entirely
separate
offense
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state.
that's
reducing
due
process
to
empty
conceptualism,
to
verbalism,
to
formalism.
and
if
duplicate
prosecution
were
attempted
under
a
pair
of
statutes
like
that,
this
court
would
be
faced,
but
this
isn't
our
case
for
determining
the
constitutional
substance
of
the
matter.
whether
the
difference
between
the
two
statutes
has
constitutional
significance
so
as
to
permit
successive
trials
or
whether
they
ought
to
come
under
the
regular
constitutional
protection
which
goes
back
to
the
--
to
the
origins
of
our
law.
another
--
another
example,
i'll
mention.
in
the
early
--
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
republic,
the
--
the
federal
government
relied
on
the
state
courts
to
--
to
enforce
federal
law,
to
enforce
federal
rights
by
passing
state
statutes.
and
there's
a
statute
still
on
the
books.
the
federal
statute
that
allows
the
postal
laws
to
this
--
be
enforced
by
the
states.
now,
suppose
that
--
now,
suppose
that
illinois
passes
a
statute
making
it
a
crime
to
forge
postage
stamps.
now,
i
submit
it
would
be
shocking
to
say
that
a
man
could
thereby
for
the
same
act
for
forging
a
postage
stamp
be
subjected
to
successive
prosecutions
on
the
two
sovereignties
theory.
that
one
was
against
the
piece
of
dignity
of
united
states
and
the
other
was
an
entirely
separate
offense
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
illinois.
what
--
if
there's
a
difference
in
the
gist
or
gravamen
of
the
statute,
then
--
then
it's
all
right
to
have
--
have
duplicate
prosecutions.
that
the
statute
--
and
the
example
that
i
--
that
i
--
i'll
give
you
an
example
there.
the
--
that's
the
gauthier
case
in
this
court.
the
gauthier
case
was
a
case
where
the
statues
had
different
--
had
different
purposes
for
the
same
act.
gauthier
case
is
well
known
for
the
justice.
now,
another
case
where
the
--
where
the
cases
are
not
in
point
are
the
punishment
cases.
and
this
was
really
a
--
a
digression
to
point
out
the
two
--
that
the
decision
of
two
offenses
of
the
same
offense
for
purposes
of
preventing
successive
trials
is
an
entirely
different
question
whereby
the
same
offense
for
purposes
of
double
and
multiple
punishment
by
the
same
jurisdiction.
there
isn't
any
such
thing
as
tempting,
if
there
were,
but
there
isn't
any
such
thing
as
a
unit
of
the
offense
or
unit
of
prosecution
for
all
purposes.
now,
this
is
brought
out
very
well
in
the
gore
case
which
this
court
decided
on
june
30
of
last
where
a
single
sale
of
narcotics
was
held
to
be
the
following
three
offenses
for
purposes
of
cumulating
punishment,
upheld
the
punishment,
first,
making
the
sale
not
in
pursuance
of
a
written
order,
two,
not
in
the
original
stamp
package,
and
three,
facilitating
the
concealment
and
sale
of
narcotics.
now,
we
don't
quarrel
such
multiple
punishment.
but
suppose
the
defendant
in
gore
had
been
tried
and
acquitted
of
one
of
those
offenses,
could
the
others
be
used
as
the
basis
of
trying
and
over
again
for
the
same
sale?
it'll
be
monstrous.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
of
course
it'd
pretty
hard
to
say
that
it
--
it
--
in
the
first,
this
is
introduction,
it'd
be
pretty
hard
to
say
that
because
the
insurance
is
all
collected
from
these
--
from
these
banks
and
the
banks
are
--
are
banks,
as
i
understand
it,
goes
into
bankruptcy
first
and
the
insurance
is
used
to
pay
off
the
depositors
computed
by
the
other
banks.
so
it's
pretty
--
it's
pretty
far
distant
to
say
it's
protecting
federal
funds.
it's
related
to
the
banking.
that's
the
--
that's
what
said
all
through
the
cases
in
--
that's
defending
the
mann
act.
they
didn't
say
the
purpose
was
to
encourage
interstate
commerce
but
i
suppose
the
railroad
would
be
held
by
--
by
the
fares
paid
by
the
women
going
across
by
the
--
by
the
--
such
cited
goods
that
pay
freights
to
go
across.
they
don't
--
they
never
go
into
that.
this
court
does
not
go
into
that.
they
say
it
is
related
to
bank.
now,
if
the
--
if
congress,
to
come
back
with
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
congress
had
said
in
--
in
so
many
words,
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
do
that
by
--
this
court
would
still
have
the
question
to
my
mind
determining
whether
that
was
really
true
or
not,
whether
--
because
a
formula
--
a
formula
doesn't
get
around
constitutional
questions.
but
when
--
when
congress
didn't
intend
that
certainly
this
court
ought
not
--
ought
not
to
imply
lightly
a
conclusion
that
the
gravamen
and
the
gist
of
these
statutes
is
the
same
or
it
will
produce
double-jeopardy.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
my
contention
is
that
the
method
--
that
the
method
by
which
the
statute
proceeds
is
fully
as
important
as
the
purpose.
the
method
by
which
the
statute
proceeded
was
to
protect
the
banks
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
clearly
brought
out
by
the
record
just
the
same
as
the
method
in
the
--
in
the
federal
enclave
question
of
a
sex
crime
being
duplicated
just
to
prevent
sex
crimes
in
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
of
course,
it
is
that
federal
government
can
preempt
the
field
here.
and
my
argument
is
that
if
the
federal
government
wants
to
assert
its
supremacy
and
it
is
desirable
to
have
its
supremacy
asserted,
it
should
assert
it
by
providing
the
man
must
be
tried
the
first
time
in
a
federal
court
and
not
by
proceeding
by
way
of
violating
ancient
principle
in
allowing
the
state
and
the
federal
government
to
do
this
thing
together
between
thems.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
it
seems
to
me
very
obvious
that
this
--
that
this
court
would
not
allow
people
to
be
tried
twice
in
federal
enclaves
where
the
jurisdiction
is
concurrent.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
this
--
this
thing
is
prohibited
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
by
the
fourteenth.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
it
is
alleged
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
it
is
alleged
there
is
a
gap.
and
my
premise
is
that
we
shouldn't
allow
gap
in
basic
principle,
unless
it
is
really
necessary
to
this
division
of
sovereignty
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
where
the
gravamen
of
the
gist
of
the
statute
and
the
way
it
proceeds
that
the
two
statutes
are
the
same
i
then
--
in
--
in
that
case,
there
is
no
reason
for
this
gap
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
and
the
court
ought
to
uphold
the
principle.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
exactly.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no,
i
don't,
it's
a
fault.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no.
but
i
--
my
example
was
the
case
of
counterfeiting.
suppose
they
passed
a
law
to
protect
the
united
states
as
in
my
postage
stamp
example,
nobody
gets
cheated
but
the
federal
government
in
my
postage
example,
in
the
same
way
with
counterfeiting.
suppose
that
--
that
the
state
passes
a
law
prohibiting
having
counterfeit
tools
for
counterfeiting
united
states
bills
now,
can
you
try
a
man
over
again
for
that
on
the
ground
the
two
separate
interests
are
protected?
i
say
no.
but
even
though
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
of
course,
he
does.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
of
course,
he
does
but
they'd
never
upheld
--
they'd
never
--
this
court
has
never
upheld
crime
and
twice
for
it
though.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
i
don't
know
all
the
state
cases.
there's
a
great,
enormous
number
of
cases
on
double-jeopardy.
but
this
court
had
never
held
except
in
the
one
case
of
lands
under
the
eighteenth
amendment
of
which
the
circumstances
are
very
special
and
the
cases
and
the
amendment
has
been
repealed.
but
a
man
after
having
been
tried
over
again
having
been
tried
once
by
one
jurisdiction
can
be
tried
over
again
by
the
--
up.
that
has
never
been
held.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
correct.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
correct,
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that's
my
proposition.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
in
order
to
show
that
the
case
is
different
from
the
case
where
the
interests
are
obviously
different
as
in
the
case
of
a
man
being
tried
for
assault
or
murder
in
--
in
a
state
and
then
being
tried
--
being
acquitted,
let
us
say,
then
being
tried
over
again
in
the
federal
government
for
violation
of
his
civil
right
to
vote.
those
--
those
things
are
different
and
therefore,
i'd
say
that
due
process
does
not
arise.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
say
that
it's
if
--
you
can
try
people
over
again
on
--
out
of
a
single
state
of
facts
if
the
gist
and
gravamen
of
the
offenses
are
different.
the
burden
here
is
the
same,
i
beg
this
court
to
find
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
and
the
reason
i've
mentioned
the
others
is
to
show
that
this
case.
the
reason
i
mentioned
the
legislative
history
is
simply
to
show
that
this
case,
this
case
is
not
a
case
where
they
are
different.
this
is
a
case
where
the
court
should
look
through
this
thing
just
as
in
the
--
as
in
the
federal
enclave
or
in
the
postage
stamp
case.
and
take
the
postage
stamp
case.
suppose
he's
counterfeiting
postage
stamps.
it
doesn't
cheat
any
individual.
it's
--
it
protects
the
united
states.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
so
what
was
the
--
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
now,
as
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
that
it's
the
principal
argument
made
against
us.
the
heart
of
the
argument
made
against
us
is
that
unless
the
state
is
allowed
to
relitigate
federal
criminal
judgments,
the
federal
government
would
equally
be
prevented
from
relitigating
state
judgments.
and
that
would
be
a
limitation
on
the
federal
judicial
power
and
on
federal
supremacy.
and
i
agree
that
the
rule
out
will
work
both
ways.
the
states
--
whatever
the
states
can
--
can
or
cannot
do
over
again,
the
federal
government
are
equally
not
to
be
able
to
do
over
again.
now,
let's
suppose
that
state
prosecutions
have
shown
themselves
to
be
ineffective
in
some
area.
suppose
they
all
too
often
result
in
acquittals.
there's
no
need
to
try
the
acquitted
man
over
again
to
preserve
federal
supremacy.
the
regular
normal
constitutional
method
has
been
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
that
is
that
congress
can
preempt
the
field
of
postal
crime
in
the
case
of
the
post
office.
congress,
all
congress
has
to
do
is
to
take
from
the
state
the
power
to
act
in
that
particular
situation.
now,
in
the
field
of
bank
robbery
where
cooperation
between
federal
and
state
authorities
is
notoriously
gross,
it's
almost
inconceivable
that
preemption
would
ever
become
necessary
but
the
(inaudible)
of
certain
views
where
congress
might
sometime
find
it
necessary
to
preempt
in
order
to
protect
the
federal
supremacy
from
the
effect
of
a
prior
state
acquittal.
the
congress
need
not
take
over
an
entire
field.
it
could
make
a
partial
preemption
of
course.
it's
been
so
held
--
held
to
this
court.
for
example,
this
is
as
if
a
protection
--
it's
a
possibility.
congress
might
provide
that
a
state
could
not
begin
a
trial
in
a
certain
field
until,
say,
30
days
after
notifying
the
united
states
attorney.
so
that
the
united
states
attorney
would
have
the
opportunity
to
proceed
first.
but
that's
only
how
you
would
do
it
with
the
help
of
the
congress.
but
the
resources
of
federal
preemption
are
ample
and
manifold.
and
preemption
is
the
decent,
effective
and
regular
constitutional
method
of
protecting
federal
jurisdiction
and
making
sure
if
you
don't
raise
to
the
courts,
because
this
only
occurs
in
a
--
in
an
area
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
where
--
where
congress
can
--
can
preempt.
you
can't
have
double
prosecutions
unless
--
unless
there
was
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
federal
supremacy
does
not
require
trying
if
--
an
acquitted
man
over
again.
now,
i
said
this
case
is
an
open
question
for
the
court.
and
the
case
that
is
cited
against
us
is
this
prohibition
case
of
united
states
against
lanza.
and
that
held
that
in
that
field,
federal
supremacy
did
require
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
try
a
man
over
again.
so
retried
and
convicted
bootlegger
from
escaping
with
a
small
fine.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
he
was
found
guilty.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so
in
the
lanza
case.
he
was
convicted
--
he
was
convicted
out
in
seattle
and
given
a
short
sentence
and
the
federals
did
not
think
it
was
long
enough
so
they
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
prosecute
him
again.
now,
the
reason
why
a
result
--
this
trying
--
retrial
could
be
defended
and
while
lanza
could
be
defended
in
that
particular
case
was
that
under
the
eighteenth
amendment,
preemption
was
not
available
as
it
is
in
all
the
other
fields
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
congress
could
not
take
over
the
field
of
liquor
regulation
because
the
court
held
in
the
lanza
case,
the
congress
could
not
protect
federal
supremacy
by
taking
over
the
field.
and
i
quote
from
the
lanza
opinion,
“the
--
the
eighteenth
amendment
"put
an
end
to
restrictions
upon
the
state's
power
arising
out
of
the
federal
constitution.”
special
language
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
which
is
the
only
time
the
word
“concurrent”
was
ever
used
in
the
constitution.
they
found
that
for
their
federal
preemption
in
the
field
of
liquor
regulation
in
whole
or
in
part.
so
however
unfair
double
prosecutions
may
have
been,
a
state's
immunity
from
preemption
in
the
liquor
field
supported
the
court
in
that
case
in
finding
that
they
really
were
necessary.
but
the
power
of
the
federal
government
under
the
eighteenth
amendment
would
have
been
sterilized
because
of
that
amendment
by
--
by
state
action.
they
held
in
that
case
in
chief
justice
taft's
opinion,
that
the
field
could
not
be
preempted
and
the
court
really
found
in
effect
that
its
result
in
lanza
was
required
by
the
eighteenth
amendment
and
the
eighteenth
amendment
has
been
repealed.
the
alleged
authority
of
lanza
simply
does
not
exist
and
this
court
is
free
to
act
and
this
court
has
never
violated
the
sanctity
of
a
former
acquittal.
all
the
other
cases
referred
to,
the
dicta
and
their
dicta
for
us
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
fully
equalling
the
dicta
against
us.
they're
all
cases
where
a
man
was
being
tried
for
the
first
time.
and
he
said,
“oh,
you
can't
try
me
because
the
federals
can
try
me
over
again.”
there
was
no
double-jeopardy
there
at
all.
and
the
courts
had
all
known
separate
jurisdiction.
and
those
expressions
were
taken
to
mean
--
were
taken
to
mean
what
they
--
what
lanza
prevented
--
lanza
permitted
successive
prosecutions.
this
court
has
never
decided
that.
in
lanza,
the
early
authorities
were
never
discussed.
in
1678,
that
was
settled
in
the
leading
case
of
rex
against
hutchinson
referred
to
on
our
brief
on
page
40.
that
a
man
acquitted
in
portugal
couldn't
be
tried
again
in
england.
that
was
the
standard
of
fairness
and
due
process
which
the
founding
fathers
were
accustomed
to.
now,
our
brief
cite
other
common
law
materials
and
american
colonial
materials,
the
same
effect
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
strong
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
seventh
amendment
that
the
fifth
amendment
prevents
retrial
after
state
acquittal
but
my
time
is
quick
nearly
gone.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
i
would
like
very
much
to
say
a
few
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
on
that
very
much.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that's
our
second
major
point
which
is
an
entirely
independent
ground
of
reversal.
now,
the
law
--
the
law
is,
of
course,
thoroughly
settled
that
the
federal
government
cannot
try
a
man
over
again
who
has
been
adjudged
innocent
in
a
federal
court,
federal
government.
and
here,
the
federal
officers
acting
for
the
united
states
kept
on
trying
to
convict
him.
the
fifth
amendment
would've
prevented
them
from
constitutionally
doing
it
in
a
federal
court.
and
we
submit
that
for
them
to
do
it
indirectly
though
the
state
court
is
equally
unconstitutional.
our
point
is
that
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
for
a
state
to
convict
a
man
on
the
basis
of
such
assistance
and
testimony
of
federal
officers.
if
the
double-jeopardy
provision
of
a
fifth
amendment
means
anything,
it
must
mean
that
a
man
who's
once
been
acquitted
finally
by
a
federal
court
ends
the
matter
and
the
federal
government
and
all
its
officers
must
stop
trying
to
prove
him
guilty.
and
here,
they
didn't
consider
the
federal
--
petitioner's
acquittal
by
united
states
court
is
the
definite
cut-off
point.
as
i
stated
the
facts,
they
kept
on
making
--
building
up
the
case
and
working
for
it.
it
seems
to
me
our
case
is
like
the
case
of
forced
confession
or
obtaining
evidence
by
stomach
pumping
which
this
court
has
held,
cannot
be
done
under
either
the
fifth,
fourth
or
fourteenth
amendments.
and
neither
federal
nor
state
officers
should
be
permitted
to
evade
these
violations
of
due
process
by
working
through
the
other
jurisdiction.
and
that
is
the
implication
of
what
the
court
said
last
june
30th
in
knapp
against
schweitzer.
the
court
found
there
was
no
evidence
in
that
case
that
the
state
was
used
as
an
instrument
of
federal
prosecution.
but
the
court
said,
“if
a
federal
officer
should
be
a
party
for
the
compulsion
of
testimony
by
state
agencies,
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
come
into
play.”
now,
knapp
against
schweitzer
was
a
state
case.
so
the
way
it
would
come
into
play
would
be
as
a
violation
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes,
i
can
refer
you
that
very,
very
readily.
the
--
the
state's
attorney
of
cook
county
said
on
the
record
at
page
26
that
the
federal
authorities
came
to
him
and
the
interviewing
of
the
alibi
witnesses
is
in
the
unprinted
transcript
which
we
printed.
we
didn't
--
this
--
this
being
a
case
of
government
is
printing
at
government
expense,
we
didn't
print
much
of
an
abstract.
but
if
we
--
we
printed
it
at
page
96
of
our
brief,
in
--
in
appendix
there.
that's
--
those
--
those
--
that
testimony
is
all
there.
the
state's
attorney
said
on
the
record
that
the
federal
authorities
gave
him
the
testimony
of
what
those
officers
did
is
right
there.
it's
perfectly
plain,
and
i'm
sure
that
--
that
the
opposing
counsel
will
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
opposing
counsel
will
agree
that
there's
no
question
of
what
the
federal
officers
did
exactly
as
i
state
in
the
facts
here.
there's
been
a
question
about
that,
i'm
sure
that
it
can't
be
disputed.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
i
suppose
if
they
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
they
could've
been,
i
suppose
that
they
could've
been
caught,
they
could've
--
could've
been
enjoined
under
the
--
under
principles
of
this
court
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
the
state
officers
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
of
course,
i'm
not
speaking
of
where
the
state
--
where
the
federal
officers
simply
responded
to
subpoena
and
testified.
they
prepared
this
case,
they
didn't
stop,
they
prepared
this
case
and
that's
the
fact,
and
i'm
sure
that
you
can
be
satisfied
of
that
and
i'm
sure
that
the
state
of
illinois
will
not
dispute
it.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i'm
saying
it's
--
yes,
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
that
is
my
position.
it's
a
violation
of
due
process.
it's
a
violation
of
due
process
for
that
to
be
allowed
to
be
done
against
the
man.
otherwise
--
otherwise,
all
the
liberties
that
this
court
has
protected
so
much
will
be
--
will
be
frittered
away
because
wrong
things
will
be
done
in
one
jurisdiction
with
a
tremendous
and
very
praise-worthy
cooperation
that
is
going
on
between
the
different
officers,
the
federal
and
state
officers.
they
--
while
the
--
these
improper
things
will
then
be
done
over
again
on
the
other
jurisdiction.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
suppose
that
so.
but
i
assume
it
must
be
by
way
of
due
process
which
is
the
only
way
you're
--
you're
finding
all
mistakes.
i
suppose
that's
the
only
way
of
finding
all
mistakes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
would
(inaudible)
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
mr.
chief
justice.
and
especially,
i’d
like
to
speak
about
these
--
about
these
authorities
that
were
mentioned.
these
authorities
that
common
law
where
it
was
decided
and
this
is
very
much
applicable
to
the
line
of
questioning
to
which
justice
frankfurter
was
addressing
himself
yesterday.
it
was
found
and
settled
in
common
law
involved
in
more
than
one
case,
and
in
the
hutchinson
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
particularly
that
murder
--
the
man
had
been
convicted
of
murder
in
portugal,
he
could
not
be
tried
over
--
he’d
been
acquitted
--
acquitted
of
murder
in
portugal,
he
could
not
be
tried
over
again
in
england.
thus
it
--
thus
it
was
established
that
--
that
the
common
law
--
due
process
of
law
at
common
law
meant
that
the
policy
of
portugal
was
not
sufficiently
separate
in
a
crime
like
murder
where
the
gist
and
gravamen
of
the
offense
is
the
same
under
portuguese
law
as
under
english
law
is
--
is
therefore
settled
that
due
process
did
--
did
prevent
the
man
being
tried
over
again
in
england
for
that
same
offense.
so
that
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
i
think
the
murder
was
committed
on
the
high
seas.
there
would
have
to
be
of
course
concurrent
jurisdiction
mr.
justice.
we
only
get
this
difficulty
at
all
in
these
narrow
classic
cases
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
a
case
--
kind
of
a
case
where
i
suppose
if
somebody
shipped
poison
candy
from
one
jurisdiction
to
the
other,
i
suppose
the
murder
would
be
committed
in
both
cases.
i
think
it’s
on
the
high
seas
as
i
recall
the
case
that
it
will
show
--
it
will
show
there.
so,
that
mr.
wines
have
just
argued
and
speaking
about
the
creation
of
dual
jurisdiction,
he
says
to
argue
that
the
state
and
the
nation
are
more
alien
to
each
other
than
foreign
countries
are
to
each
other
at
common
law.
now,
as
to
palko
against
connecticut,
palko
against
connecticut
expressly
left
open
this
question,
in
the
very
words
of
justice
cardozo
and
in
opinion
of
the
court,
this
particular
case
we’re
now
arguing
is
expressly
left
open
in
that
case.
now,
these
other
cases
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i
--
i
certainly
do
you
honor
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
and
--
and
some
of
the
justices
have
so
held
--
some
of
the
cases
so
held.
they’ve
said
that
there
is
this
--
these
parties
are
entitled
and
the
state
is
entitled
to
one
trial
free
from
error.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well
that
isn’t
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
a
--
a
separate
case.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
that’s
my
opinion
mr.
justice
and
i
have
given
it
but
the
just
--
justices
of
this
court
are
different
on
that
very
point.
so
that
one
cannot
express
himself
with
a
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
in
--
in
other
cases,
i
think
that
in
cross
against
north
carolina
seems
to
me
was
a
case
whether
there’d
been
discussion
to
that
point
that
it’s
not
so
bad,
it’s
an
entirely
different
fresh
case.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
i'm
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
--
i’m
sure
that
some
of
the
justices
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
they
believed
that
--
that
the
successive
prosecution
should
not
be
allowed
in
the
case
that
you’ve
mentioned
and
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
yes
and
in
palko
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
no,
in
palko,
they
expressly
left
it
open
and
they
gave
the
analogy
that
i
mentioned
yesterday
--
mr.
walter
t.
fisher
well,
if
the
line
must
be
drawn
somewhere,
we
don’t
have
to
draw
it
for
this
case.
if
it
your
--
if
your
honor
is
arguing
that
it’s
equally
unjust,
why
perhaps
that
view
will
prevail
someday
on
this
court.
i’d
like
to
say
one
more
word
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
about
the
--
these
authorities.
and
that
is
the
fox
against
ohio
and
moore
against
illinois,
and
herbert
against
louisiana
that
mr.
wine’s
mentioned
are
--
are
not
double
jeopardy
cases.
a
man
has
to
be
tried
twice
to
get
double
jeopardy.
and
all
these
cases
were
cite
--
and
that’s
how
this
confusion
arose
originally.
they
all
recite
the
definite
doctrine
that
mr.
wine
has
pronounced
that
in
the
american
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction,
both
the
state
and
the
nation
can
prosecute
until
the
field
has
been
taken
over
by
congress.
they
both
can
prosecute.
they
both
can
try
the
man.
this
said
over
and
over
again
and
those
expressions
have
led
some
people
to
believe
the
additional
fact
--
this
does
not
follow
at
all
that
after
one
jurisdiction
has
completed
it’s
proceeding,
has
acquitted
the
man
that
then
the
other
one
can
start
in
and
then
try
him
over
again.

is
not
necessary,
and
it
is
not
been
held
ever
in
any
case
except
in
the
conviction
case
of
lanza
by
this
court.
that’s
the
only
case,
that
was
the
conviction
case
and
that
case
is
separate
as
i
argued
yesterday.

thank
you
very
much.
