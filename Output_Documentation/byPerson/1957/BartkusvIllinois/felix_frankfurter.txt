justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
plead
guilty
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher,
are
all
these
facts
that
you
cited
thus
far,
i
suppose
the
full
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
record
--
is
--
is
the
record
in
the
federal
trial
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
--
i
didn't
mean
the
substantive
prosecutions
but
in
the
recitals
that
you
gave
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
conduct
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
district
judge
and
the
activities
of
federal
official,
are
they
acquitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
little
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
stenographic
record
is
with
the
clerk,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
me
whether
--
can
we
look
at
the
proceeding?
should
it
be
deemed
relevant
in
the
district
court,
the
united
states
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
instance,
the
remarks
you
--
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
found
some
relevance
to
the
remarks
of
the
judge
and
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
in
--
they
are
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
because
i
assumed
it
may
be
relevant
that
i
am
asking
whether
the
--
whether
the
materials
are
here
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
again,
but
you
--
your
last
statement,
it
becomes
very
important
if
your
contention
is
that
the
activities
of
federal
officials
from
the
judge
down
constituted
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
an
injunction
upon
federal
activities,
then
it
becomes
very
important
that
all
the
materials
bearing
on
that
be
properly
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
what
do
you
derive
the
differences,
your
qualification
interest
me,
unless
it
represent
some
different
purpose
of
policy
from
what
do
you
derived
the
difference
in
purpose
of
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
knocking
down
a
postman
in
the
--
in
the
post
office
building
in
chicago
which
is
both
an
obstruction
of
the
mail,
that
he
is
carrying
a
mail
back
and
also
the
(inaudible)
assimilation
statute
in
which
they
--
those
are
two
clearly
different
purposes,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
saying
he's
--
he's
trying
to
deliver
something
and
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
trying
to
get
a
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
make
a
difference
if
the
punishments
are
drastically
different
and
the
amount
of
proof,
bank
robbery
involving
element
of
violence
that
is
--
it
interferes
with
some
other
aspect
of
banking
might
merely
be
something
with
a
small
punishment
that
interferes
with
something
else.
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
there
in
any
case,
mr.
fisher,
involving
these
questions
as
between
federal
prosecution
for
counterfeiting
and
state
prosecution
for
the
same
act
on
the
score
of
fraud?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
don't
quarrel
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
not
--
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
depending
on
what
the
limitation
against
double
jeopardy
for
they
--
it
binds
two
different
countries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
clear
that
area.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
mere
identity
of
offenses
doesn't
take
care
of
the
facts
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you've
got
two
different
lawmaking
bodies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
you
think
the
beginning
of
article
7
governs
the
whole
of
it
in
suits
at
common
law?
is
a
criminal
trial
a
suit
at
common
law
in
that
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
manual
entitles
it
but
just
as
his
own
words.
i
wouldn't
curb
it
or
confine
it
by
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
the
manual
labor.
but
in
suits
at
common
law
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
you
don't
agree
and
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
your
historic
was
turning
--
starting
point
is
correct.
however,
it's
terrible
it
may
seem
that
all
sorts
of
advantages
or
rather
handicaps
that
a
defendant
had
in
a
criminal
case
that
a
defendant
in
a
civil
suit
did
not
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
be
a
witness.
he
couldn't
take
the
stand
defended.
he
couldn't
have
a
lawyer,
federal
attendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
--
where
is
that
broad
dicta
--
broad
statement
from,
mr.
fisher?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
--
does
your
statement,
mr.
wines,
of
the
fidelity
of
mr.
fisher's
statement
of
the
fact
cover
is
reference
to
the
participation
of
federal
officials
in
the
state
prosecution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
de
facto
they
were
active
--
they
were
active
and
cooperative
in
the
state
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
quite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
documentary
evidence
introduced
at
this
trial
in
the
state
court
into
this
conviction?
do
you
have
some?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
any
--
were
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
there
is
any
evidence
that
was
turned
over
by
the
federal
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
state
or
physical
evidence
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
autoptic
proffered.
it
can
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
irrational.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
oh,
but
stenographic
minutes
aren't
illegal
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
gather
from
your
answers
to
justice
harlan
that
the
fbi
man
sat
next
to
the
local
prosecutor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
he
was
there.
the
active
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
one
may
say,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
on
your
own
statement,
it's
a
little
more
than
that
in
this
case,
you
say
stimulation
or
instigation
if
--
did
it
get
going
by
the
judges
that
conscientious
feeling
that
a
great
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
those
--
those
things
aren't
taking
down
by
stenographer
at
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
why
judges
do
badly,
they
do
sometimes.
not
only
in
chicago
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
a
state-initiated,
the
state
pursue,
state-conducted
prosecution
in
the
course
of
which
the
state
call
as
an
official,
as
a
competent
witness
to
testify
for
something
or
happens
to
be
(inaudible)
is
the
federal
official
based
it
as
a
--
of
the
--
the
fact
or
fact.
i
don't
know
what
the
illegal
consequences
but
you
may
be
wholly
right,
a
different
thing
from
having
a
federal
judge
get
the,
plus
the
fbi,
get
the
state
machinery
going
to
bring
about
that
result
as
a
--
as
fact,
that's
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
the
difference
equals
to
the
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
may
well
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wines,
the
word
"intrinsic"
covers
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
entrapment
and
in
the
prosecution
induced
by
the
entrapment
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
vitiated
the
prosecution
(inaudible)
and
say
that
was
intrinsically
illegal
rather
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
de
facto
may
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
can
prosecute,
you
say
you
can
prosecute
effectively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
know
revert
at
the
first
--
of
the
three
contention
that
mr.
fisher
had
adopted.
i
understand
illinois,
your
position,
could
be
that
assuming
identity,
carbon
copy
of
the
element
of
a
crime,
short
of
the
one
that
you've
indicated,
and
i'll
say
why
you
shrink
from
that,
assuming
that
identity
proves
in
a
prosecution
of
state
court
which
was
preceded
by
quid
pro
in
the
federal
court,
you
say
that
such
separation
of
power,
that
means
the
two
governments
that
due
process
does
not
absorb
that
which
would
be
clearly
double
jeopardy.
it
--
it
had
acquired
merely
in
the
federal
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
two
powers
are
compartmentalized
constitutionally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
the
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
the
charge
of
the
federal
district
judge
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
transcript
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
is
the
record
of
the
federal
trial
in
the
clerk's
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
fisher,
if
a
state's
fiscal
institution
just
take
money
then
this
is
also
federally
insured,
has
the
government
of
the
united
states
an
interest
in
the
protection
of
the
values,
money
and
safety
of
that
institution
that
is
different
from
and
in
addition
to
the
interest
for
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
not
talking
about
this
meeting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
the
federal
government
regulate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
but
it
makes
us
--
it
--
it
matters
to
the
united
states
as
a
governmental
system
that
banks
which
the
deposit
of
which
it
insures
within
a
certain
sovereignty,
is
that
right
or
--
or
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
resources
being
not
depleted,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
but
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case,
but
that's
a
--
that's
an
interest
that
pertains
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
wholly
unrelated
to
the
relation
of
that
institution
to
the
state's
affairs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
each
of
the
two
governments
has
governmental
interest
different
from
and
apart
--
apart
from
that
which
pertains
one
to
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
make
the
question
less
pertinent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
each
has
a
separate
share
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
maybe
a
common
--
a
common
social
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
where
the
question
arises
whether
each
may
not
take
measures
to
protect
that
individualized
social
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
we
haven't
got
preemption
there.
we
have
--
we
have
a
case
where
the
federal
government
having
--
being
insurer
is
therefore
the
whole
show,
the
whole
governmental
show.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
have
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
suggesting
here
that
because
--
you're
not
suggesting
that
federally
insured
state
banking
institution
preempt
the
authority
of
the
state
to
deal
with
invasions
of
the
interest
of
a
state
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
identity
--
but
the
whole
question,
and
i
hope
you
return
before
you
take
your
sit,
mr.
fisher,
there
is
not
an
identity
of
the
invasion
of
the
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
nobody
will
listen
to
you
more
than
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
couldn't
back
a
statute
to
say,
“we'll
have
the
fbi
help
every
time
a
state
is
not
competent
itself
to
deal
with
local
robberies
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
jurisdictional
basis,
it
means
that
you
deliver
it
to
constitutional
federal
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
why
you
can't
attribute
to
congress
what
--
that
it
intended
to
do
something
which
is
the
only
constitutional
basis
on
which
you
had
right
to
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
--
to
protect
the
banks
which
are
not
national
banks
because
if
you
had
--
if
this
were
a
national
bank
and
then
you
have
a
whole
different
problem
of
the
state
of
--
the
state
of
illinois
or
probably
the
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
the
relation
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
this
statute
institution
is
very
different
from
the
relation
of
the
united
states
to
national
bank.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
our
problem
is
because
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
not
chosen
to
do
that
and
our
question
is
whether
that
interrelation
violate
what
you
the
ancient
principle.
i'm
surprised
that
i
--
i'm
must
--
i'm
surprised
that
you
--
that
you
laid
so
much
waste
and
spent
so
much
and
you
tend
to
seem
to
depend
so
much
on
the
fact
what
was
said
as
to
why
they
ask
an
act
which
can
have
only
one
constitutional
basis,
namely,
that
the
government
had
some
fiscal
relation
to
state
institutions,
the
--
the
department
of
which
it
ensures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
seem
to
me
obviously
that's
lightened.
it
merely
the
hard
expression
of
a
general
principle
that
this
government
needs
to
(inaudible)
and
do
any
--
everything
that
he
doesn't
like.
i
just
like
(inaudible)
of
the
union.
that
is
not
yet
proven
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
argued
here
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
fisher.
as
i
gather
from
your
argument,
you
do
not
follow
that
the
early
decisions
more
than
100
years
old,
at
least
more
than
100
years
old
that
if
a
man
passing
the
counterfeit
$5
bills,
uncle
sam
can
get
him
for
passing
the
counterfeit
bills
and
the
state
can
get
him
for
destroying
the
fellow
to
whom
--
on
whom
he
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
follow
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that's
just
of
much
shopping
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
he
passes
the
counterfeit
$5
bill,
he
commits
a
federal
offense
and
he
did
commit
the
state
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
court
has
sat
to
100
years
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
if
he's
--
he
is
acquitted
in
the
federal
court
for
passing
a
counterfeit
$5
bill,
he
can't
be
tried
for
fraud
under
state
law
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
understand
your
proposition.
i
fully
understand
the
(inaudible)
that
due
process
--
that
you're
--
it's
on
the
things
(inaudible)
to
be
profoundly
--
so
profoundly
disturbed
by
having
a
man
acquitted
in
the
federal
court
for
something
that
the
federal
offense
that
under
the
same
state
of
evidence
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
be
tried
in
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
that.
i
don't
understand
your
proposition
that
you
go
to
find
out
why
the
government
of
united
states
made
it
an
offense
to
the
rob
money,
committed
robbery
in
a
federally
insured
state
institution.
that
hasn't
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
passing
a
counterfeit
$5
bill
is
a
manifestation
of
cheating
but
you
can
prosecute
him
both
under
the
federal
law
and
under
the
state
law
because
the
federal
government's
interest
is
not
have
counterfeit
bills
and
the
state
interest
did
not
have
people
to
fraud
them
and
yet
they
all
arise
down
of
a
single
state
of
facts
out
of
a
single
state
of
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
sell
me
those
counterfeit
postage
stamps
(inaudible)
the
federal
government
can
get
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
have
people
cheated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
fisher,
where
in
the
record
is
the
weightiest
or
the
most
--
the
fullest
proof
of
--
of
the
facts
with
the
--
the
inference
of
which
you
now
speak,
namely,
if
the
federal
authorities
having
the
same,
through
their
endeavor,
to
land
this
man
to
jail
with
a
federal
prosecution
went
across
the
street
or
wherever
they
went
to
get
the
state
people
to
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
they
failed
in
doing?
would
you
mind
referring
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
minutes
are
here,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
these
federal
prosecutors,
using
your
prosecutors,
i
mean
not
only
the
lawyers
but
all
the
other
--
the
federal
agents
or
prosecution
in
that
in
your
indictment,
got
a
trial
which
resulted
in
an
acquittal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
not
start
all
over
again
in
the
federal
court.
and
what
you
are
saying
is
the
double-jeopardy
provision
prevents
them
from
utilizing
the
state
court
through
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
state,
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
but
you
insist
on
claiming
due
process.
so
why
don't
you
--
wouldn't
you
say
that
just
as
in
the
--
you
referred
to
statutes,
early
statutes
and
some
(inaudible)
by
which
the
congress
utilized
the
state
courts
to
enforce
federal
law
although
there
are
state
courts
that
are
enforcing
federal
law.
so
the
prohibition
against
double-jeopardy
prevails
in
a
prosecution
in
the
federal
court
and
isn't
a
--
too
much
of
a
stretch
considering
we're
dealing
with
a
constitutional
amendment
that
a
conviction
secured
by
the
federal
authorities
which
cannot
secure
through
a
federal
court,
cannot
utilize
to
subvert
or
evade
the
provision
against
double-jeopardy
by
utilizing
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wines,
would
i
bother
if
you
start
it,
we
haven't
officially
left
off,
to
the
thing
i
put
to
mr.
fisher
last,
namely,
that
through
instrumentality
of
state
prosecution
in
the
state
court,
federal
officials
can
defeat
the
prohibition
against
double-jeopardy
in
the
what
amendment
--
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
committed,
would
you
include
not
merely
affected?
that
--
that
carries
with
it
many
--
it
has
long
range
of
meaning
but
stimulate,
instigate
and
as
the
chief
justice
said,
practically
guide
the
state
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
makes
no
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
–
may
i
ask
whether
your
remark
did
nothing
more
to
say
even
if
the
proposition
is
so
obvious
or
in
your
view,
so
controlled
by
authority
that
you
think
it’s
--
it
doesn’t
call
for
further
argument,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i’m
not
asking
you
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
more
than
you
want
to
say,
i
just
want
to
know
whether
your
--
your
test
eternity
on
the
subject
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it’s
controlled
by
authority
or
self-evidence
proposition,
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
leave
palko,
let
me
ask
you
this?
do
you
think
it’s
--
its
less
power
to
allow
the
state,
the
same
state
having
secured
the
conviction,
resulting
in
life
sentences
to
be
allowed
to
appeal
and
allege
there
only
excluding
by
a
court
which
leads
to
a
new
trial
and
then
sends
a
man
to
death,
do
you
think
that’s
less
harsh
than
to
allow
the
united
states
to
prosecute
and
equip
and
then
connecticut
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
that’s
the
theory.
all
i'm
talking
about
the
human
fact.
here
is
the
fellow
who’s
been
tried.
the
judges
rule
according
to
his
conscience.
he’s
convicted
and
they
given
a
life
sentence
and
then
the
state
can
start
all
over
again
and
take
his
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don’t
talk
about
theory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--’m
talking
about
--
what
you’re
talking
about
harshly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
–
where
did
they
differ?
in
palko,
there
was
one
dissent,
but
they
did
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
that’s
a
theory
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
me
it
still
makes
a
difference
whether
the
court
decides
or
whether
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
that
i’m
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
probably
educated
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
still
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don’t
know
any
case
that
was
more
thoroughly
considered
of
few
cases
than
palko.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you’re
not
asking
us
to
overrule
it?
i
can
understand
if
you’re
asked
us
to
overrule
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
leave
it
open
because
it
would
a
good
judge
always
leave
no
more
question
that
isn't
before
a
court.
