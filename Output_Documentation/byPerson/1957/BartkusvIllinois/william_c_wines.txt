mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
the
principle
question
propounded
by
this
case
has
been
clearly
delineated
by
mr.
fisher
and
his
fair
elusive
statement
of
the
facts
relieves
me
of
a
burden
of
restating
them
in
any
detail.
the
facts
are,
as
mr.
fisher
has
said,
that
the
petitioner
was
indicted
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
for
the
robbery
of
a
savings
and
loan
association
that
was
federally
insured.
he
was
acquitted
in
that
court
and
concededly
with
the
assistance
of
federal
law
officers
was
retried
in
the
illinois
courts
for
the
same
bank
robbery
where
he
was
convicted
under
our
habitual
criminals
act.
the
principle
question
raised
by
petitioner
is
whether
the
acquittal
in
the
federal
court
barred
prosecution
in
the
state
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
now,
federal
officials
did
unquestionably
assist
in
the
--
in
the
state
prosecution.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
now,
your
honors,
i
should
first
like
to
say,
opening
the
argument
of
this
question,
that
the
overwhelming
consensus
of
theoretical
expression
both
on
the
part
of
the
courts
and
commentators
has
been
since
early
times
that
conviction
or
acquittal,
and
i
repeat,
or
acquittal
in
the
forums
of
the
national
sovereign
does
not
bar
a
retrial
for
the
same
facts
in
the
forums
of
the
state
sovereign
or
vice
versa.
and
in
palko
against
connecticut,
to
which
i
know
i
address
myself,
this
court
has
held
that
even
acquittal
in
the
courts
of
a
state
doesn't
bar
retrial
in
the
courts
of
that
state
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
there's
nothing
in
the
state
law
to
inhibit
such
retrial.
and
may
i
now
address
palko
against
connecticut.
in
connecticut,
there
was
the
time
with
the
palko
case
enforce
the
statute
that
had
been
enacted
in
1886.
unlike
the
laws
of
most
states,
connecticut
law
allowed
the
state
to
appeal
a
verdict
of
acquittal
for
error
of
law.
palko
was
tried
on
an
indictment
charging
him
with
murder
in
the
first
degree
which
offense,
if
conviction
should
result,
was
punished
by
--
punishable
by
death
at
that
time.
mind
you,
the
indictment
charged
him
with
murder
in
the
first
degree.
he
was
found
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
now,
under
the
most
elementary
teachings,
the
conviction
of
a
lesser
offense,
where
the
indictment
charge
a
greater
offense,
operates
as
an
acquittal
of
the
greater
offense
where
an
indictment
charges
murder
or
conviction
of
manslaughter
operates
as
an
acquittal
of
murder
where
an
indictment
charge
is
robbery,
but
the
verdict
is
only
conviction
of
larceny
and
operates
as
an
acquittal
of
the
greater
crime
of
robbery.
notwithstanding
this
verdict,
connecticut
appealed,
state
appealed
to
connecticut's
own
supreme
court
and
that
court
found
reversible
error
in
failure
to
exclude
--
to
admit
a
confession
and
in
other
respects
not
material
here.
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
reversed
at
the
state's
instance
not
at
the
defendant's
instance,
the
verdict
remanded
the
case
and
palko
was
tried
in
a
trial
presumably
free
from
these
errors
that
the
--
that
it
infected
the
first
trial.
and
this
time,
if
the
court
please,
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
opinion
but
was
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
and
he
spoke
for
a
unanimous
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
not
quite,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
pardon,
there
was
one
dissent.
mr
--
mr.
justice
cardozo
held
in
the
plainest
of
terms
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not,
of
its
own
vigor,
inhibit
retrials
even
by
the
same
sovereign
and
even
after
acquittal.
i
--
i'm
aware
that
the
court
does
not
like
extended
reading
from
the
text
but
there
are
two
sentences
of
mr.
justice
cardozo,
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
i
should
like
to
read
and
adopt.
he
says
at
page
323
of
the
official
report,
“right
mind
of
men,
as
we
learn
from
these
opinions,
could
reasonably
even
mistakenly
believe
that
a
second
trial
was
lawful
and
prosecution
subject
to
the
fifth
amendment
if
it
was
all
in
the
same
case.
even
more
plainly,
right
minded
men
could
reasonably
believe
than
in
spousing
that
conclusion,
they
were
not
favoring
a
practice
repugnant
to
the
conscience
of
mankind.
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
declared
that
retrials
after
acquittal
do
not
so
violate
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
as
to
deny
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
if
the
court
please,
a
leading
case,
and
i
want
to
say
that
illinois
is
fully
cognizant
that
on
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari,
question
is
presumably
open
here
for
reconsideration
on
principle
notwithstanding
the
pronouncements
of
earlier
decisions,
but
a
case
that
explorers,
the
conception
of
dual
sovereignty
extensively
and
imported
the
major
deliberations
and
conclusions
of
this
court
is
united
states
against
lanza
in
260
u.s.
377.
in
that
case,
the
defendants
were
charged
in
the
federal
court
with
the
sale,
manufacture,
transporting
and
having
in
their
possession
of
the
same
liquor
is
that
involve
in
the
state
prosecution.
now,
it's
true,
as
petitioner's
counsel
points
out
that
in
the
lanza
case,
there
had
been
no
trial
in
the
state
courts.
that
is
true.
nevertheless,
the
case
was
argued,
considered
and
treated
in
and
by
this
court
as
involving
the
question
of
the
right
of
both
sovereigns,
national
and
state
to
prosecute
the
same
defendants
for
the
same
alleged
offense.
and
in
the
lanza
case,
again,
if
i
may
read
just
a
few
words,
the
court
said
at
page
382,
“we
have
here
two
sovereignties
deriving
power
from
different
sources
capable
of
dealing
with
the
same
subject
matter
within
the
same
territory.”
continuing
mr.
cardozo
says,
“each
may,
without
interference
by
the
other
enact
laws
to
secure
prohibition
where
the
end
that
no
legislation
can
give
validity
to
acts
prohibited
by
the
amendment.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
every
citizens
of
the
united
states
is
also
a
citizen
of
a
state
or
territory.
and
in
moore
against
illinois,
now,
that
case
involved
a
violation
of
the
slave
--
slavery
laws
so
it
is
not
exactly
an
advance
sheet
case.
but
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
declared,
as
the
court
held
in
the
lanza
case,
that
every
citizens
of
the
united
states
is
also
a
citizen
of
a
state
or
territory
that
he
may
be
said
to
allow
or
allegiance
to
do
sovereigns
and
maybe
liable
to
punishment
for
an
infraction
of
the
laws
of
either.
now,
even
when
the
same
sovereign
prosecutes
for
the
same
state
of
facts,
if
the
same
state
of
facts
constitutes
two
separate
offenses
such
that
although
only
one
set
of
fact
is
involved,
each
offense,
the
offenses
are
not
identical
and
in
one
offense,
something
has
to
be
proved
that
does
not
have
to
be
proved
in
the
other
offense,
dual
prosecution
does
not
result
in
double
jeopardy.
the
expressions
of
this
court
on
the
point
are
rather
few,
but
in
the
case
of
carter
against
mcclaughry,
183
u.s.
365,
cited
in
our
brief,
this
case
had
before
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
arose
in
the
military
law,
a
court-martial
proceeding.
in
that
case,
the
officer
had
been
charged
separately
with
the
making
of
false
federal
warrants
or
requisition
for
funds
and
with
an
attempt
to
defraud
the
united
states.
what
he
had
actually
done
was
obtained
the
money
from
the
united
states
by
false
warrants.
and
this
court
held
that
a
conviction
upon
both
of
those
specifications
didn't
vitiate.
it
was
not
vitiated
by
the
inhibitions
against
double
jeopardy
and
quoting
from
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
gray
in
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts,
the
court
says,
“the
conviction
or
acquittal,
the
conviction
or
acquittal
upon
when
indictment
is
no
barred
with
subsequent
conviction
and
sentence
upon
another
unless
the
evidence
required
to
support
a
conviction
upon
one
of
them
would
have
been
sufficient
to
warrant
a
conviction
upon
the
evidence.
now,
i
think,
your
honors,
that
i
can
best
express
the
gist
of
illinois'
contention
in
these
considerations
and
reflections.we
realized
that
on
constitution
or
any
other
question
that
come
before
this
court,
consensus,
virtue
unanimity
or
even
complete
unanimity
of
juridical
thought
on
the
part
of
lower
courts,
law
professors,
writers,
other
jurists,
even
this
court's
own
previous
decisions
are
never
conclusive.
but
the
question
involved
in
this
case,
your
honors,
is
whether
the
retrial
by
illinois
of
a
man
who
has
been
acquitted
in
the
federal
courts
for
the
same
alleged
malefactions,
so
violence
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
so
offense
the
universal
sense
of
justice
as
to
deny
due
process
of
law.
now,
i
submit,
your
honors,
with
all
the
earnestness
of
my
command
that
when
a
prosecution
is
in
accordance
with
the
overwhelming
consensus
of
juridical
opinion,
both
that
of
courts
and
that
of
commentary,
it
can't
possible
so
far
offend
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
as
to
deny
due
process
and
until
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
and
to
companion
cases,
there
wasn't,
so
far
as
my
researches
have
gone
or
so
far
as
mr.
fisher's
researches
have
gone
at
least
in
contemporary
times,
there
was
a
time
when
the
question
had
not
been
the
subject
of
expression,
very
much
any
doubt
at
all
that
prosecutions
by
two
sovereigns
were
permissible
and
admissible
even
though
the
same
facts
were
relied
upon.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
the
federal
statute
did
require
a
proof
of
one
additional
element
that
was
not
required
by
the
illinois
statute.
and
that
additional
element
was
that
the
institution
that
was
the
subject
of
the
robbery
must
have
been
federally
insured.
in
that
case
--
in
this
case,
however,
the
effect
of
such
federal
insurance
was
supplied
by
stipulation
but
i
don't
rest
my
argument
principally
upon
the
ground
that
illinois
had
to
prove
less
to
convict
the
petitioner.
less
facts,
i
don't
mean
--
i
didn't
have
to
prove
the
facts
but
it
did
have
to
prove
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt
but
that
it
had
to
prove
one
last
fact,
namely,
federal
insurance
as
a
prerequisite
to
conviction.
the
illinois
principle
contention
is
that
by
adopting
the
constitution
of
united
states,
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
states
didn't
conceive
and
nobody
has
conceived
that
they
were
abdicating
their
right
to
try
for
and
punish
crimes
of
violence
against
persons
and
properties
within
their
territories.
should
the
federal
government
undertake
to
make
the
same
acts
criminal
particularly
when
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
the
field,
and
any
such
suggestion
is
explicitly
disclaimed
by
mr.
fisher
in
his
argument
in
this
case.
so
to
hold,
would
be
to
hold
that
the
constitution
was
a
compact
by
which
the
states
have,
in
some
manner,
compromised
or
abridged
or
abdicated
their
power
to
punish
such
simple
crimes
of
violence
as
robbery
should
the
federal
government
prosecute
in
and
earlier
case.
now,
mr.
fisher
raises
other
questions.
he
says
that
even
if
illinois
might
retry
this
--
this
petitioner
and
might
be
trying
these
crimes
in
general,
due
process
is
denied
because
federal
officials
were
active
in
the
prosecution
and
procurement
of
the
conviction
which
is
under
review
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
they
certainly
did.
and
one
federal
officer,
i
don't
want
to
minimize
the
fact
of
--
of
federal
cooperation
at
all,
it's
the
custom
in
illinois,
and
i
suppose
it
is
in
most
states,
it
trust
you
when
its
allowed
to
have
only
one
witness
present
throughout
the
entire
trial
when
the
witness
is
requested,
they
can
always
have
one
witness
there.
as
the
witness
of
the
states
attorney
selected
was
an
fbi
agent
who
was
present,
and
all
other
witnesses
were
excluded
throughout
the
--
the
trial.
mr.
william
c.
wines
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
record
goes
quite
that
far
as
to
say
--
as
to
show
that
they
requested
the
prosecution,
but
i
will
say
that
the
inference
is
--
is
rather
strong
that
--
that
the
government
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
stimulated
is
exactly
the
word
i
--
i
would
like
to
adopt.
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
they
instigated
it
but
they
--
they
stimulated
it
and
they
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
you
mean
documentary
evidence?
i
--
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
recall
any.
mr.
william
c.
wines
physical
evidence?
mr.
william
c.
wines
documentary
evidence?
mr.
william
c.
wines
[laughs]
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
recall
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
recall
that
there
--
that
there
was
your
honor.
certainly,
none
that
what
was
suggested
had
been
illegally
obtained.
now,
wait
a
minute,
i
have
to
correct
myself.
if
you
mean
was
the
--
were
notes
stenographic
transcripts
of
the
first
trial
in
the
federal
court
used
to
cross-examine
and
impeach
witnesses?
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
no,
i
say
there
was
--
there's
no
question
that
any
evidence
was
illegally
obtained,
even
obtained
much
less
turned
over
to
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
supposed
so,
your
honor.
the
trial
doesn't
show
just
where
he
sat
but
that
would
be
where
he
would
normally
sit
in
a
--
in
an
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
was
--
he
was
there.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
now,
it's
--
it's
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
we're
right
on
our
fundamental
premise
that
this
prosecution
by
illinois
after
federal
prosecution
isn't
vitiated
by
the
due
process
clause
that
there's
no
reason
why
federal
agents
cannot
assist
in
that
prosecution.
they
are
citizens
having
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
whether
if
he
sat
that
they
act
as
federal
officials
for
--
as
state
officials,
if
the
prosecution
itself
is
lawful
and
is
not
only
--
its
not
only
lawful
to
prosecute
but
its
being
convicted
without
the
use
of
any
illegally
obtained
evidence,
any
extorted
statements
or
anything
of
that
sort,
that
certainly,
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
mean
this.
it
doesn't
mean,
"well,
now,
illinois
you
can
try
mr.
bartkus
for
this
bank
robbery.
and
you
can
call
any
witnesses
you
want
to
but
you
must
have
any
help
from
any
federal
official,
mustn't
have
any
testimony
or
if
you
can
have
testimony,
that's
all
you
can
have.
they
can't
confer
with
him
outside
the
witness
box.
you
--
you
can't
have
any
assistance,"
that,
i
think,
would
be
a
fantastic
result.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
record
shows
nothing
about
that.
the
record
doesn't
even
convene
the
--
the
federal
judges'
expressions.
mr.
william
c.
wines
according
to
the
newspapers,
not
according
to
anything
in
the
transcript
in
this
case,
if
your
honor
please,
and
mr.
--
mr.
fisher
so
stated.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
are
but
they
were
introduced
in
this
record.
mr.
--
mr.
fisher
has
appended
to
his
brief.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
know
(inaudible)
he
has
appended
to
his
brief
as
appendix
in
his
--
at
page
--
pages
90
through
page
94,
excerpts
of
(inaudible)
those
excerpts
are
not
at
any
place
in
this
record
printed
or
unprinted,
so
i'm
unable
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
but
even
supposing
that
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
as
a
fact,
it
is
different.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
suggest
that
it's
a
difference
without
constitutional
consequences.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
--
the
position
of
illinois
in
this
case
is
that
if
we
can
prosecute
at
all,
it
makes
no
difference
as
to
the
instant
we
prosecute
or
how
much
help
we
get
so
long
as
the
help
that
we
get
isn't
tainted
by
any
intrinsic
illegality
such
as
the
evidence
that
having
been
illegally
obtained
or
they're
being
bribery
by
fellow
officials
or
sovereign
agent
or
forgery
or
anything
of
that
sort,
none
of
which
is
claimed,
mostly
candid,
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
of
course,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
i
mean
it
would
be
illegal
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
mean
it
would
be
illegal
apart
from
any
question
of
former
acquittal.
that's
--
that's
what
i
really
mean,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
i
say
that
illinois
isn't
to
prosecute
at
all
or
maybe
we
can.
we
can
take
any
measures
that
we
could
have
taken
and
it's
not
been
for
this
former
federal
trial.
mr.
william
c.
wines
effectively
and
at
the
instance
of
anybody.
that
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
illinois,
so
far
as
this
former
trial
is
concerned.
now,
mr.
fisher
also
raises
a
question
in
his
brief
which
he
did
not
have
time
to
discuss,
but
which
i
wish
to
mention
very
briefly.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
that's
right.
i
don't
want
to
leave
any
misapprehension
on
that
point
at
all.
and
i
pointed
out
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
what
i
say,
your
honor.
now,
mr.
fisher
raises
one
other
point
in
his
brief
which
he
did
not
discuss
in
his
oral
argument
and
i
want
to
discuss
it
only
briefly.
in
the
trial
in
illinois,
some
of
petitioner's
witnesses
were
cross-examined
as
their
testimony
from
the
transcripts
of
the
federal
court
proceedings
in
the
usual
manner,
"weren't
you
asked
such
and
such
a
question
and
didn't
you
make
such
and
such
a
reply?"
the
defendant
sought
to
introduce
evidence
in
the
state
court
that
he
had
been
acquitted
in
the
federal
court.
the
trial
judge
in
the
state
court
refused
to
permit
the
jury
in
a
state
court
to
know
the
verdict
in
the
federal
court.
and
it's
contended
in
the
brief
that
that
rule
denies
due
process
of
law.
we
say
that
that
question
raises
only
a
question
of
evidence,
it
being
the
very
well
set
of
general
rule
that
one
jury
is
not
to
be
told
what
another
jury
did
with
the
same
case.
it's
a
--
generally
speaking,
one
jury
has
never
told
what
a
former
jury
in
that
or
any
other
court
decided.
now,
it
is
true
that
--
no,
had
--
had
petitioner
been
convicted
in
the
federal
court
instead
of
acquitted,
the
state
couldn't
have
shown
that
conviction
as
proof
of
guilt
in
this
case
though
they
might
have
used
it
to
impeach
him
if
he
testified.
but
we
say
that
that's
outmost
the
question,
a
question
of
state
law
and
not
a
federal
law.
so
to
sum
up
illinois'
position
in
this
case,
we
say,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
overwhelming
consensus
of
opinion
has
been
up
until
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
that
conviction
or
acquittal
in
a
federal
court
does
not
by
a
retrial
in
a
state
court
for
the
same
facts
or
vice
versa.
we
note
in
this
case
that
proof
of
an
additional
fact,
namely,
the
presence
of
federal
insurance
was
required
in
the
federal
case,
we
say
that
if
we
can
prosecute
at
all,
we
can
prosecute
with
the
full
aid
and
even
at
the
instance
of
federal
prosecutors
provided
that
no
illicitly
obtained
evidence
is
used
or
other
illicit
means
are
used
to
prosecute
the
case,
we
can
prosecute
just
as
though
there
had
been
no
federal
trial
and
we
say
that
no
error
in
intervened
in
failure
to
tell
the
jury
in
the
state
court
that
petitioner
had
been
acquitted
in
the
federal
court.
by
those
considerations,
we
respectfully
submit
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
should
say,
your
honor,
it
will
not
bother
me
to
start
where
mr.
fisher
left
off.
and
i
should
say
that
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
primarily
that
of
the
right
of
the
state
to
prosecute.
and
if,
as
i
shall
argue
in
due
course,
the
state
has
the
right
to
prosecute
notwithstanding,
the
fact
of
an
acquittal
in
a
federal
court
as
that
right,
if
otherwise
existing,
is
not
frustrated
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
federal
officers
assist
state
officers
that
they
subdue,
i
submit,
not
only
as
federal
officers
but
as
private
citizens
having
knowledge
that
a
crime
had
not
been
committed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
say
that
makes
no
difference.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
say
that
if
illinois
can
prosecute
at
all
in
this
case
as
i
shall
in
due
course
say
that
she
can.
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
don't
--
we
don't
again
say
that.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
said
you
may
assume
that.
we
do
not
again
say
that
the
federal
officers
went
to
the
state
officers
and
that
they
gained
the
fullest
assistance
and
you
can
say,
if
you
like,
instigated
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
of
course,
i
don't
know
just
exactly
what
the
complete
partition
of
labor
is
--
was
concerned
with.
but
so
far
as
i
know,
the
statement
would
be
correct.
so
far
as
i
know,
the
federal
officers
--
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court
to
the
detriment
of
the
prisoners,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
federal
officers
went
to
the
states
attorney's
office
and
said,
“here
is
the
case
against
a
man
who
has
been
acquitted
in
the
federal
court.”
that
it
doesn't
appear
in
those
words
in
the
record
but
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference
and
i
don't
think
i
ought
to
try
to
disassemble
it.
now,
i
should
like
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
federal
government
could
not,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
we
say
that
--
we
say
that
that
is
not
the
federal
government
trying
him
again
in
the
state
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
--
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
say
that
that
is
not
the
case,
your
honor.
i
should
like
to
say
this.
we
begin
--
i
have
in
mind
the
--
and
i'm
not
through
with
the
discussion
of
the
right
of
federal
prosecuting
officials
to
testify
against
and
assist
the
state
in
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
but
i
shall
return
to
it
after
i
have
laid
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
constitutional
ground
work
for
our
position
on
the
second
question.
we
say
in
the
first
place
such
utterances
as
this
court
has
about
to
say
upon
the
proposition,
all
of
them
vindicate
the
right
of
a
state
to
prosecute
for
the
same
state
of
facts
that
the
federal
government
may
prosecute
for
and
permit
the
federal
government
to
prosecute
upon
the
same
state
of
facts
that
the
state
can
prosecute
for.
there
is
no
case
exactly
like
this
one
and
that
is
no
united
states
supreme
court
case.
but
i
would
like
to
begin
by
knowing
that
this
court
held
before
i
get
to
the
dual
sovereignty
case,
this
court
held
in
palko
against
connecticut
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
inexorably
prevent
retrial
even
by
the
same
sovereign.
in
the
palko
case,
palko
was
acquitted
in
a
state
court.
that
state,
unlike
most
states,
permitted
the
state
to
have
an
appeal
and
to
obtain
a
new
trial.
the
state
did
appeal
and
connecticut's
higher
courts
ordered
a
new
trial
for
palko.
on
that
second
trial,
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
and
this
court
held
that
so
long
as
there
was
not
a
mere
prosecution,
repeated
trials
as
long
as
there
was
some
reason
for
retrial,
retrial
did
not
deny
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
even
though
a
similar
retrial
would
have
constituted
double-jeopardy
under
the
fifth
amendment
if
the
retrial
had
occurred
in
a
federal
court.
so
we
cannot
begin
our
consideration
of
this
case
with
any
assumption
that
double-jeopardy
per
se
denies
due
process
and
then
simply
argue
about
what
constitutes
double-jeopardy.
the
initial
premise
that
double-jeopardy
per
se
denies
due
process
is
not
sound
unless
palko
against
connecticut
is
to
be
overruled.
now,
in
over
100
years
ago,
in
the
fox
case,
this
court
declared
that
both
the
state
and
the
federal
government
may
prosecute
the
utterance
of
false
coins,
the
passing
of
counterfeit
moneys.
and
it
used
language,
i
don't
wish
to
read
at
length
from
the
brief.
but
i
should
like
to
say
that
in
the
later
case,
still
over
100
years
old
of
moore
against
illinois
where
the
--
this
court
upheld
dual
prosecution
of
the
interference
of
the
relation
between
a
master
and
a
slave.
this
court
then
said,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
quote
just
a
few
words
that
i
think
are
pertinent,
“every
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
also
a
citizen
of
a
state
or
territory.
he
may
be
said
to
all
legions
to
two
sovereigns
and
may
be
liable
to
punishment
for
an
infraction
of
the
laws
of
either.
the
same
act
maybe
an
offense
or
transgression
of
the
laws
of
both,
thus,
an
assault
upon
the
marshall
of
the
united
states
and
hindering
him
in
the
execution
of
legal
process
is
a
high
offense
against
the
united
states
for
which
the
perpetrator
is
liable
of
punishment.
and
the
same
act
may
be
also
a
gross
breach
of
the
peace
of
the
state,
a
riot,
assault
or
a
murder
and
subject
the
same
person
to
punishment
under
the
state
laws
for
misdemeanor
or
felony."
now,
in
the
lanza
case,
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
in
a
state
court
in
violation
of
the
state's
liquor
laws,
the
state's
prohibition
laws.
he
was
subsequently
tried
and
convicted
in
a
federal
court
of
the
same
sale
of
intoxicating
liquor.
and
this
court
sustained
both
convictions
declaring
that
one
who
violates
the
laws
of
both
a
state
and
the
federal
sovereign
is
amenable
to
the
prosecution
of
both.
it's
true
as
mr.
fisher's
pointed
out
that
that
was
a
case
that
dealt
with
double
conviction.
and
it's
also
true
as
mr.
fisher
pointed
that
the
eighteenth
amendment
specifically
said
that
both
the
state
and
the
federal
government
shall
have
concurrent
powers
to
enforce
this
amendment.
nevertheless,
the
case
did
not
turn
upon
nor
it
was
rationale
to
confine
to
or
by
those
considerations
of
former
conviction
and
the
explicit
language
of
the
eighteenth
amendment.
the
court
declared
and
measured
an
unmistakable
terms
that
one
who
violates
the
laws
of
both
sovereigns
is
amenable
to
prosecution
by
both
sovereigns.
now,
it
has
been
the
--
i
should
like
to
deal
with
mr.
fisher's
argument
that
the
policies
of
the
two
statutes,
the
federal
and
the
state
statute,
are
the
same
or
to
put
in
more
accurately
that
their
purposes
are
the
same
because
both
interdict
the
armed
robbery
of
financial
institutions.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
suggested,
i
don't
mean
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
intimated
decision
on
the
point.
the
federal
interest
protected
by
the
federal
statute
is
that
--
of
the
united
states
government's
fiscal
interest
in
federally
insured
banks
or
in
this
case,
a
savings
and
loan
association.
whereas
the
purpose
is
observed
by
a
state
statute
is
that
of
protecting
its
citizens
against
marauders,
armed
depredations
and
the
loss
of
the
property
without
regard
to
any
federal
or
other
insurance
interest
in
the
institution
that
is
the
subject
matter
or
whose
employees
are
the
victims
of
a
robbery.
but
even
if
the
purposes
could
be
said
to
be
identical
as
where
a
state
and
federal
criminal
safety
may
--
statute,
if
there
were
no
preemption
of
the
field,
might
be
said
to
be
identical
in
both
for
preserving
--
intend
to
preserve
human
life.
we
say
that
although
there
are
different
interests
protected,
there
needn't
be,
that
it's
inherit
and
implicit
in
the
concept
of
dual
sovereignty
that's
generated
by
the
united
states
constitution.
that
both
sovereigns
have
the
right
to
prosecute
each
independently
of
the
other
and
that
--
that
one
of
the
prices
paid
for
dual
sovereignty
is
dual
powers.
with
--
as
in
this
case
the
possibility
that
an
acquittal
by
one
sovereign
may
be
followed
by
a
conviction
in
the
forum
of
another
sovereign.
that
is
the
general
understanding
of
the
cases.
repeated
trials
for
the
same
offense
don't
necessarily
deny
due
process,
don't
always
constitute
double-jeopardy.
i
might
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
--
i
believe
the
unanimous
court
held
in
the
flemister
case
that
where
a
filipino
shot
two
officers
in
a
rapidly
successive
shots,
double-jeopardy
wasn't
offended
by
two
prosecutions.
so
it's
not
true,
as
mr.
fisher's
argument
would
suggest,
that
every
time
a
man
is
tried
twice
as
a
result
of
the
same
acts,
due
process
is
denied.
it's
well
to
note
too
that
generally,
throughout
the
united
states,
even
the
same
sovereign
can
prosecute
twice
for
closely
related
offenses.
since
this
case
was
argued
last,
your
honors
have
held
in
the
ciucci
case
that
where
--
by
a
majority
of
the
court,
that
where
a
man
by
a
single
burning
and
rapidly
successive
shots,
murdered
the
wife
and
three
children
each
of
the
deaths
was
a
separately
punishable
crime.
and
your
honors
have
held
in
the
hoag
case
that
successive
robberies
in
a
same
transaction
give
rise
to
conviction
on
the
second
charge
even
though
there
was
an
acquittal
on
a
former
charge.
it's
--
it's
the
hour
for
adjournment,
is
it
not,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
said
it's
the
hour
for
adjournment,
is
it
not?
mr.
william
c.
wines
all
right.
we
urge
that
this
is
part
of
the
price
that
is
paid
for
dual
sovereignty.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
assuming
you
can
have
successive
prosecutions
at
all,
state
officials
may
be
aided
by
or
even
instigated
by
federal
officials.
mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
argued
that
multiple
prosecutions
by
the
federal
government
and
a
state
where
the
same
acts
offend
the
laws
of
both
sovereigns
have
not
been
thought
so
far
to
offend
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
as
to
result
in
the
denial
of
due
process
of
law
and
i
have
nothing
to
add
at
the
moment
to
the
argument
that
i
made
yesterday
afternoon.
i
should
like
to
continue
briefly
to
discuss
the
question
whether
there
was
such
activity
on
the
part
of
federal
officers
in
the
matter
of
the
state
prosecution
of
the
petitioner
as
to
result
in
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
william
c.
wines
neither
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
neither
your
honor,
i
had
said
what
i
had
to
say
upon
the
subject
unless
the
court
has
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--question.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
is
no
case
precisely
like
this
one
in
the
annals
of
this
court.
there
is
no
case
where
a
man
has
been
acquitted
in
a
federal
court
and
subsequently
retried
for
the
same
conduct
in
a
state
court.
so
i
can't
say
that
it’s
controlled
by
any
precise
authority,
but
i
do
say
that
the
authorities
that
i
discussed
yesterday
and
the
consensus
of
understanding
by
courts
i
believe
throughout
the
country
generally
that
each
sovereign
may
prosecute
without
offending
due
process
seems
to
be
an
accepted
principle
of
american
constitutional
jurisprudence.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
find
it
indicated
your
honor
in
the
cases
that
i
sited
yesterday.
i
find
it
indicated
in
the
lanza
case,
in
the
moore
case
and
in
herbert
against
louisiana
which
is
like
the
lanza
case
to
the
extent
that
the
defendants
were
indicted
for
violation
of
the
louisiana
statute,
prohibiting
the
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
and
were
then
indicted
in
the
federal
court
for
the
same
alleged
offense.
and
although
there
had
been
no
trial
in
the
state
court,
this
court
had
occasion
to
say
where
such
manufacturer
that
is
of
intoxicating
liquors
is
thus
doubly
denounced.
one
who
engages
therein
commits
two
distinct
defenses,
one
against
the
united
states
and
one
against
the
state
and
maybe
he’s
subjected
to
prosecution
and
punishment
in
the
federal
courts
where
one
in
the
state
courts
where
the
other
without
any
infraction
of
the
constitutional
rule
against
double
jeopardy,
if
being
limited
to
repeated
prosecutions
for
the
same
offense.
now,
it’s
contended
that
because
government
officers
were
very
largely
instrumental
in
instigating
this
prosecution
in
the
state
courts
that
even
if
multiple
prosecutions
by
different
sovereigns
does
not
perceive
denying
due
process
that
agency
of
federal
officers
amounted
to
a
double
prosecution
by
federal
authorities
once
in
the
federal
court
and
once
in
the
courts
of
illinois.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes
sir
--
you
please
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
only
to
say
your
honor,
that
--
there
do
--
that
did
seem
to
be
a
--
a
general
principle
and
does
seem
to
be
a
general
principle
against
repeated
prosecutions
for
the
same
crime
and
there
are
i
do
think
old
english
authorities
do
tend
to
support
his
contention,
but
those
authorities
found
utterance
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
doctrine
of
dual
sovereignty.
britain
didn’t
have
the
doctrine
of
dual
sovereignty
and
we
say
that
when
the
united
states
was
born,
as
a
result
of
our
dual
sovereignty,
the
citizen
or
the
denizen
of
the
united
states
became
amenable
to
both
federal
and
state
prosecutions
when
his
activity
offended
the
laws
of
both
sovereigns.
we
say
that
implicit
in
the
conception
of
dual
sovereignty.
now,
your
honors,
if
i
am
correct
in
arguing
that
due
process
is
not
offended
by
a
state’s
prosecution
of
one
who
has
been
tried
in
the
federal
courts.
i
submit
that
it
should
follow
that
if
the
state’s
attorney,
as
we
call
our
state
prosecuting
official
in
illinois,
can
indict
and
if
the
state
courts
can
try
the
petitioner,
the
prosecution
--
prosecuting
attorney
has
the
right
to
avail
himself
of
the
testimony
of
any
witnesses
who’s
testimony
is
competent
under
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence,
that
is
they
have
knowledge
of
the
facts,
and
may
use
any
evidence
that
was
lawfully
obtained
even
though
it
was
obtained
by
federal
officials.
and
we
do
not
think
that
merely
because
federal
officials
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
state
prosecuting
authority,
the
commission
of
a
state
act
and
furnish
and
provide
him
of
--
with
evidence
of
the
defendant’s
guilt
that
that
constitutes
a
federal
prosecution.
nor
do
we
think
that
it’s
like
the
case
where
federal
authorities
have
unlawfully
and
unconstitutionally
seized
evidence
and
not
being
able
to
use
that
evidence
in
a
federal
court,
try
to
make
it
available
to
state
prosecuting
officials.
we
don’t
think
that
a
prosecution,
not
only
in
the
name,
we
pay
no
attentions
to
name,
conducted
by
the
authority
of
state
prosecuting
officials,
the
state
prosecuting
attorney
before
state
judges
and
before
a
state
jury
and
in
a
state
court
constitutes
a
federal
prosecution
even
if
the
evidence
was
obtained
by
federal
officials
and
we
submit
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
in
those
circumstances.
now,
petitioner
did
not
argue
orally,
but
he
does
urge
in
his
brief
that
it
was
error
not
to
permit
petitioner
to
show
that
he
had
been
acquitted
in
the
federal
court
if
he
could
be
tried
at
all.
we
say
that
--
that
raises
at
most
a
question
of
the
state’s
law
of
evidence.
ordinarily,
one
jury
isn’t
told
but
another
jury
has
done
with
a
case
involving
the
same
parties
and
the
same
factual
issues
and
we
see
no
denial
of
due
process
in
that
ruling
on
law
of
evidence.
to
sum
up
and
conclude,
we
think
that
every
utterance
of
this
court
supports
the
proposition
that
due
process
is
not
denied
by
prosecution
by
both
sovereigns
for
the
same
act
offends
the
laws
of
both
sovereigns
and
that
if
that
the
state
may
prosecute
at
all,
it
may
use
any
lawfully
acquired
evidence
to
support
its
prosecution.
i
will
remind
your
honors
again
that
in
palko
against
connecticut,
this
court
held
that
due
process
does
not
per
se
inhibit
second
trial
even
by
the
same
state
if
that
state’s
laws
permit
such
a
trial
and
if
--
if
it
doesn’t
appear
that
there
is
simply
an
intention
to
harass
the
defendant
and
prosecuting
him
time
after
time
for
the
same
offense.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
appealed
from
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
thank
you
chief
justice.
