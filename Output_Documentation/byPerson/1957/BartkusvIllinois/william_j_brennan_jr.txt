you
make
no
point
in
this
argument,
mr.
fisher,
of
the
statements
of
the
trial
judge
in
the
federal
court
following
the
acquittal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
fisher,
this
argument
assumes
that
these
are
the
same
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
substance,
that's
to
suggest
there
is
however
a
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
otherwise
the
proof
in
each
instance
upon
the
sovereignty
was
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
otherwise
the
proof
required
whether

mr.
fisher,
may
i
come
back
a
moment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
question
of
same
offense
apart
from
the
subject
matter
that
you
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
were
just
discussing.
now,
in
hoag,
the
only
difference
between
hoag's
first
and
second
trials
in
matter
of
proof
was
that
at
the
second
trial,
the
proof
was
that
it
was
john
smith,
in
the
first
trial,
it
was
john
jones
robbed
by
the
same
act
committed
by
hoag.
now,
how
does
that
differ
from
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
at
the
--
at
the
same
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
one
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
is
the
identity
here
is
more
obvious.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
than
it
was
in
hoag.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wines,
may
we
then
assume
that
the
appraisal
to
be
given
the
portions
of
the
record
to
which
mr.
fisher
referred
us
justify
the
inference
that
the
federal
officers
did
instigate
and
guide
this
state
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
guided
the
prosecution.
