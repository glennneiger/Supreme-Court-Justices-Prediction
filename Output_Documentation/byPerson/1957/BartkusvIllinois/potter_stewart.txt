well,
isn't
it
true,
mr.
fisher,
perhaps
technically
on
the
end,
perhaps
unrealistically
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
--
first
of
all,
the
state
statute
covers
any
kind
of
armed
robbery
at
a
bank
or
a
grocery
store
anybody
else?
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn't
it
then
true
at
least
technically,
that
the
defense
against
the
state
is
an
offense
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
safety
of
its
citizens
whereas
the
offense
against
the
federal
government
is
--
is
invades
the
protection
of
federal
funds?
isn't
that
right?
