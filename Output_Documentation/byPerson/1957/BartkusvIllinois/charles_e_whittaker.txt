justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
remember
correctly,
mr.
fisher?
it
was
stipulated
here,
was
it
not,
that
this
bank
is
federally
insured?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
do
you
say
that
one
who
might
be
convicted
under
one
system
might
be
tried
again
in
the
other,
but
if
he
were
acquitted
that
could
not
--
he
could
not
be
tried
again.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
actually
pleaded
guilty
in
lanza.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
was
his
own
freedom,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you'll
go
as
far
as
mr.
fisher
who
said
the
truth
is,
the
federal
officers
actually
prepared
this
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
one
more
question
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
or
in
that
connection,
mr.
wines,
please?
you
say
that
you
maintain
that
illinois
couldn't
try
him
again.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
admit
the
federal
government
couldn't.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
if
the
federal
government
actually
prepared
this
case
that
was
tried
in
the
state
court
as
presented
by
mr.
fisher
and
in
which
you
do
not
take
violent
disagreement,
isn't
this
in
effect
for
the
federal
government
to
be
trying
him
again
but
in
the
state
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
using
it
really?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
--
not
the
federal
government
actually
using
the
state
court
as
a
vehicle
to
accomplish
the
--
another
trial?
