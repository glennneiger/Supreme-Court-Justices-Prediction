this
is
a
jones
act
suit
whose
over
mastering
purpose
is
to
afford
a
seaman
injured
in
the
cause
of
his
employment
and
indemnity
remedy.
the
dispositive
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
crew
of
some
vessel
within
the
meaning
of
the
exclusionary
clause
of
the
defense
bases
act,
that
section
1654.
this
involves
not
merely
a
tally
of
the
evidence,
taken
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
directed
verdict
from
the
district
court
but
it
also
involves
a
question
of
construction
of
congressional
legislation
with
legislative
history
and
congressional
intent.
the
facts
are
that
the
respondent
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
united
states
government
to
receive
a
complete
texas
tower
afloat
at
east
boston
and
to
tow
it
to
georges
banks,
high
seas
to
elevate
it
and
to
install
it
and
to
complete
all
fabrication
as
necessary
in
accordance
with
plans
and
specifications
submitted.
in
order
to
perform
its
contract,
the
respondent
went
about
to
gather
materials,
men
and
boats
to
perform
this
job
and
then
went
directly
to
the
pile
drivers
union
because
the
man
in
that
union
possessed
the
required
skills
for
doing
all
kinds
of
maritime
tasks.
it
then
went
about
and
chartered
with
rules,
two
tugs
and
chartered
without
rules,
two
barges,
intending
to
take
personnel
from
off
the
tower
and
use
them
to
men
these
barges
when
they
arrive
at
the
tower
with
supplies
because
the
barges
have
to
be
anchored
in
close
proximity
to
the
tower
so
that
the
supplies
would
be
removed
from
the
barge
to
the
tower.
the
plaintiff
joined
this
craft
at
east
boston
where
he
did
maritime
work
readying
him
to
sea,
taking
aboard
supplies,
lashing
them,
storing
them,
securing
them
and
did
some
work
upon
the
case
on
at
sea.
he
then
went
with
this
boat
and
a
group
of
25
and
all
consisting
of
various
types
of
workmen
and
he
made
up
the
bridals
that
secured
the
lines
from
the
tower
to
the
tug
and
then
he
watched
the
lines
and
he
also
made
up
or
assisted
in
making
up
a
bulkhead
to
prevent
boarding
seas
from
coming
over
the
tower.
when
the
tower
arrived
at
its
site,
he
performed
maritime
tasks
to
anchor
the
tower
which
was
to
handle
windlasses.
and
then
when
the
tower
--
after
the
tower
was
anchored,
he
then
performed
some
tasks
to
assist
in
getting
the
tower
elevated
and
that
required
him
to
go
over
the
site
of
the
tower
under
very
hazardous
conditions
with
seas
breaking
over
him.
when
the
first
barge
arrived
with
supplies
for
the
tower,
he
was
ordered
along
with
several
--
with
eight
others
to
leave
the
barge
and
board
that
tower
and
he
did
so
under
perilous
conditions.
he
had
to
leave
the
tower
via
a
cargo
net
in
rough
seas
and
then
after
being
transported
to
the
barge,
he
worked
for
a
period
of
some
six
hours
doing
work
at
a
purely
strictly
maritime
nature.
and
then
he
left
the
tower,
got
onto
a
tug
and
then,
as
the
weather
became
more
mirky,
and
the
sea
more
rough,
they
took
out
a
contraption
that
was
rigged
from
--
direct
on
the
tower
and
he
boarded
that
contraption
from
a
tug
and
no
sooner
that
he
leave
the
contraption
that
it
hit
the
overhang
of
the
--
of
the
tug
and
he
received
his
injury.
the
court
below
made
a
policy
decision,
wherein
it
excluded
all
texas
tower
workers
from
the
operation
of
the
jones
act.
they
ruled
them
all
out.
contrary
to
clerk
announcements
of
this
court
both
with
respect
to
the
rule
relating
to
the
submission
of
such
an
issue
to
the
jury.
and
also,
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
relating
to
the
policy
of
bringing
in
under
the
jones
act
such
maritime
workers
as
congress
did
not
clearly
exclude.
the
plaintiff's
first
contention,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
these
words,
“member
of
the
crew”
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
exact
similar
words
in
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
assumed
that
they
have
that
identical
meaning
then
this
plaintiff
contends
that
there
was
a
factual
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
crew
member
of
this
barge.
the
barge
was
undoubtedly
a
vessel,
she
have
no
crew,
if
he
was
not
one
of
its
crew
then
who
were
its
crew.
his
work
was
strictly
of
a
maritime
nature
far
different
than
any
kind
of
work
that
dredge
man
do
upon
dredges
and
they
have
been
held
to
be
crew
members
on
--
at
least
on
a
factual
question.
now,
actually
he
wasn't
--
mr.
harry
kisloff
no.
it
did
not.
but
it
--
his
activity
aboard
the
barge
created
a
zone
of
danger
in
which
he
met
with
his
accident.
in
other
words,
his
work
aboard
the
tower
as
a
crew
men
required
him
to
go
and
to
leave
under
hazardous
and
perilous
conditions
of
the
sea
and
it
was
that
activity
that
produced
his
injury.
the
trial
judge
considered
him
--
mr.
harry
kisloff
no.
he
would
not
have
been
hurt
because
--
mr.
harry
kisloff
that's
right.
he
would
not
have
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
kisloff
it
was
that
activity.
the
trial
judge
considered
that
it
was
his
activity
at
the
time
that
controlled
his
status
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
thought
his
status
aboard
the
tower
was
very
interesting
but
not
material.
and
he
followed
a
decision
of
this
court
in
o'rourke
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
where
o'rourke
who
was
essentially
a
railroad
man
was
considered
a
harbor
worker
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
happened
to
be
on
the
top
float
at
the
time
his
injury
occurred
and
that
this
court
so
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law.
following
that
decision,
the
trial
judge
considered
him
a
crew
member
of
the
barge
but
the
trial
judge
directed
his
attention
to
section
1651,
forgetting
that
there
were
other
sections
such
as
1654.
and
he
thought,
that
no
crew
member
of
the
barge
could
recover
under
the
jones
act
if
the
work
that
he
did
was
preparatory
and
ancillary
to
the
work
upon
the
tower
because
he
said,
that
any
exclusionary
clause
had
to
be
derivative
to
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
and
he
came
up
with
the
thought
that
because
of
the
broad
language
of
section
1651,
negative,
any
--
any
incorporation
into
the
defense
bases
act
of
the
exclusion
clause.
in
other
words,
all
congress
intended
to
include
was
the
compensation
features
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
the
judge
made
an
error
of
oversight
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
man
was
no
crew
member
of
the
barge
because
even
if
injured
on
the
barge
because
they
said
his
work
was
of
a
temporary
nature.
and
that
suggests
that
ship
owners
can
avoid
the
measure
of
their
responsibility
to
crew
members
by
a
device
of
temporary
crew
members.
and
this
court
has
in
the
case
of
seas
shipping
--
sieracki
against
seas
shipping
company
passed
on
one
aspect
of
that
question
when
the
court
said
that
a
ship
owner
owes
to
longshoreman,
a
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
vessel
because
the
longshoreman
does
the
work
of
a
crew
member.
in
other
words,
he
could
delegate
the
work
but
never
the
responsibility.
those
men
who
do
the
work
and
take
the
risks
should
be
afforded
the
same
relief
as
regular
crew
members.
so
that,
taking
this
case
even
in
its
narrow
aspect,
congress
intended
to
afford
to
such
persons
who
do
strictly
maritime
work
upon
a
strict
vessel,
the
same
relief
because
they
endure
the
same
peril,
they
do
the
same
work
and
their
need
is
just
as
great.
now,
apart
from
--
apart
from
that
the
petitioner
contends
in
the
alternative
that
there
was
a
factual
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
was
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
tower.
having
in
mind
that
he
had
a
permanent
connection
with
the
tower,
having
in
mind
that
at
that
time
this
accident
occurred,
the
tower
was
merely
in
the
process
of
being
elevated
and
it
had
not
lost
its
character
as
a
--
as
a
vessel.
the
distinction,
congress
intended
to
give
an
indemnity
remedy
for
those
persons
who
do
the
work
of
crew
members
take
their
risks.
and
the
shape
of
the
vessel
should
not
determine
the
--
the
remedy
that
a
man
is
entitled
to.
if
were
--
if
one
were
to
go
through
the
three
cases
that
this
court
has
--
the
two
cases
of
this
court
has
passed
upon,
one
was
--
is
the
gianfala
case
where
the
barge
was
sunk.
certainly,
it
was
temporarily
withdrawn
from
navigation,
yet
apparently,
the
man
who
did
the
work
upon
that
thing
and
do
the
risks
that
men
endure,
that
crew
members
endure.
and
then,
if
you
were
to
analyze
the
senko
case
and
say,
well
in
that
case
the
vessel
was
merely
a
“tie
by
lines”,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
vessel
was
nailed.
he
got
this
thing
out
on
the
high
seas
and
you
have
these
men
subjected
to
all
the
perils
and
all
the
dangers
of
the
sea
and
they
do
the
identical
work
of
crew
members.
i
have
also
argued
in
my
brief
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
defense
bases
act
does
not
restrict
the
application
of
the
jones
act
one
bit.
although,
the
defense
bases
act
uses
the
identical
words
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
yet
in
fact
it
does
not
restrict
the
application
of
the
jones
act
to
any
seaman
because
in
that
very
act,
it
has
incorporated
the
provisions
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
in
that
act,
congress
intended
that
only
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
working
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states
should
have
a
compensation
remedy.
that
act
is
a
restricted
act.
it
does
not
apply
to
any
longshoremen
or
any
harbor
workers
working
beyond
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
that
act
was
incorporated
into
the
defense
bases
act
so
that
the
only
thing
left
is
whether
the
broad
language
of
section
1651
negatives
or
shows
an
intention
upon
the
part
of
congress
to
pass
a
compensation
act
for
a
segment
of
seaman.
and
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
defense
bases
act
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
intended
to
pass
a
compensation
act
for
any
segment
of
seaman.
that
broad
language
got
in
as
an
amendment
because
after
the
act
was
apparently
drafted,
there
was
a
loophole
in
the
act.
the
original
act
provided
for
accidents
on
bases
and
left
alone
accidents
off
bases.
so,
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
loophole
that
there
was
in
the
law,
congress
then
went
on
and
use
very
broad
language
indicating
that
they
were
covering
up
this
loopholes,
so
not
only
did
it
cover
accidents
on
base
but
it
covered
accidents
off
base.
and
also,
the
mere
words,
“members
of
the
crew”
because
they
happen
to
be
identical
with
the
mere
words
of
“members
of
the
crew”
as
used
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
not
indicative
that
congress
intended
to
pass
a
compensation
act
for
any
segment
of
seamen.
and
having
in
mind
the
policy
of
this
court
to
bring
within
the
hold
of
the
jones
act,
all
maritime
workers
who
are
not
clearly
excluded,
there
isn't
anything
in
that
defense
bases
act
that
shows
that
congress
intended
to
--
to
exclude
a
segment
of
maritime
workers.
finally,
the
last
argument
that
has
been
made
that
where
a
man
is
put
in
a
position
where
he
is
in
doubt
as
to
which
act
he
falls
under,
the
choice
of
the
remedy
should
be
his
because
of
the
over
mastering
purpose
of
the
jones
act.
now,
my
brother
relies
upon
a
definition
of
member
of
a
vessel,
meaning,
a
craft
or
any
matter
of
craft
used
or
capable
of
being
used
in
navigation.
that
definition
is
inclusive
but
not
--
but
not
--
it
doesn't
exclude
other
definitions,
it's
an
inclusive
definition
but
not
a
definition
that
is
a
limitation
of
other
classes.
i
believe
i'm
covered,
sorry.
mr.
harry
kisloff
yes.
mr.
harry
kisloff
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
kisloff
i
would
just
--
mr.
harry
kisloff
like
to
be
brief
on
--
on
rebuttal.
my
brother
has
pointed
out
on
a
photograph
on
the
record
and
he
says
that
is
a
picture
of
the
photograph
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
if
the
record
were
examined,
that
would
be
picture
of
the
photograph
when
the
tower
was
fully
elevated.
at
the
time
this
accident
happened,
the
tower
was
elevated
for
20
feet.
its
full
height
was
63
feet
but
the
most
important
thing
of
all
was
in
order
for
the
tower
to
be
firmly
affixed,
it
had
to
have
three
permanent
caissons
driven
by
sucking
out
air,
by
sucking
out
sand
from
those
caissons.
those
caissons
had
to
be
driven
43
feet
into
the
sea
bottom.
and
then
after
it
was
driven
43
feet
into
the
sea
bottom,
it
had
to
be
fill
--
full
of
concrete
and
--
full
of
concrete
to
seal
it
in.
so,
at
the
time
this
accident
happened,
this
tower
rest
merely
on
her
temporary
caissons.
and
just
rested
on
one
permanent
caisson,
no
permanent
caisson
had
been
driven
as
required
43
feet
into
the
oceans
bottom
and
certainly
hadn't
been
sealed
off.
that
was
how
firmly
affixed
the
tower
was
at
the
time
this
particular
accident
occurred.
now,
the
second
thing
is
that
my
brother
relies
upon
nomenclature.
this
man
was
called
and
described
and
signed
the
paper
describing
him
as
a
pile
driver.
nomenclature
is
never
determinative
of
what
a
man's
job
is.
i
think
perhaps
the
most
at
phrase
is
that
arose
by
any
other
names
now
is
justice
sweet.
it's
what
the
man
does,
not
what
he
is
described.
now,
this
barge
was
the
first
barge
to
arrive
at
the
scene
with
supplies
for
the
tower.
this
petitioner
didn't
have
a
chance
to
have
a
more
firmer
attachment
to
this
particular
barge.
and
i
have
argued
in
my
brief
that
if
this
petitioner
had
proved
competent,
then
the
respondents
would
have
used
him
again
for
they
would
have
profited
by
his
experience.
now,
a
man
can
be
a
crew
member
of
a
vessel
even
though
the
time
for
which
he
serves
upon
the
vessel
maybe
small.
if
i
have
a
boat
tied
up
in
new
bedford
harbor
and
i
want
it
transported
to
fairhaven
across
the
harbor,
15
minutes
away
if
she
has
no
crew.
and
if
i
go
out
and
get
a
captain,
an
engineer
and
a
deckhand
and
asked
them
to
take
that
boat
over
to
fairhaven
across
the
harbor,
they
are
the
crew
of
that
vessel.
there
is
no
other
crew.
they
have
a
duty
to
stand
by
that
vessel
to
preserve
her
and
to
aid
her
in
her
peril
and
they
can
look
to
her
even
for
their
wages.
the
--
the
problem
is
where
you
have
another
class
so
that
you
can
distinguish
them
from
what
is
aboard
and
from
what
--
from
who
comes
on
thereafter.
for
example,
it's
easy
to
distinguish
a
longshoremen
or
a
harbor
worker
from
the
crew
members.
they
--
they
come
on
and
they
leave.
but
the
crew
members
remained.
but
if
a
man,
if
a
--
if
the
major,
the
chief
mate
left
the
vessel
so
that
they
have
to
substitute
a
night
mate
and
a
night
mate
came
on
for
the
night,
he
is
one
of
its
crew
because
that's
his
character
and
his
compliment.
now,
my
brother
argues
that
this
is
a
minor
case.
it's
not
a
minor
case.
the
issues
here
are
great.
what
it
--
what
this
court
does
here
will
affect
a
whole
class
of
workman
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
petitioner
has
brought
this
case
up
to
this
court
and
that's
the
reason
the
respondent
has
taken
this
case
up
to.
otherwise,
the
case
would
have
been
adjusted
a
long
the
line.
now,
judge
wyzanski's
error
and
i
--
i'm
not
impugning
his
intellect
at
all.
i
mean
no
one
cold
possibly
impugn
his
intellect.
he
read
section
1651.
now,
one
directed
their
attention
to
section
1651
they
would
read,
that
the
provisions
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
act
shall
apply,
unless
otherwise
modified
to
the
following
accidents.
then
it
goes
on
into
describe
the
accident.
then
when
the
judge
reached
that
fourth
paragraph
which
was
so
broad
in
language
and
scope,
he
says
i
don't
have
to
apply.
i
don't
have
to
incorporate
into
the
defense
bases
act
all
the
provisions
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act,
i
say
that
the
definition
of
scope
of
employment
as
used
in
the
defense
bases
act
is
so
broad
that
it
negatives
a
congressional
intent
and
he
did
raise
a
serious
question
of
law.
but
had
he
read
on
and
found
that
the
defense
bases
act
had
its
separate
exclusionary
clause,
he
wouldn't
have
made
his
ruling
because
the
way
he
ruled,
he
said,
it
don't
make
any
difference
if
you
are
a
crew
member.
if
the
work
that
you
do
is
preparatory
and
ancillary
to
work
on
a
public
work
then
you
don't
come
within
the
exclusionary
clause
of
the
defense
bases
act
because
he
said,
the
exclusionary
clause
of
the
defense
bases
act
was
derivative
to
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
and
he
couldn't
do
any,
deriving
in
view
of
the
very
broad
language
of
section
1651
especially,
that
fourth
paragraph,
which
defines
a
contract
and
which
defines
a
public
work.
and
therein
lies
the
start
of
this
case
on
its
way
up.
now,
my
brother
in
his
brief
has
devoted
a
lot
of
tension
to
the
glories
of
workmen's
compensation
legislation.
and
i
submit
that
it
hasn't
fulfilled
the
dreams
of
its
office.
workmen's
compensation
legislation
originated
in
germany
on
the
days
of
bismarck
at
the
time
when
the
german
worker
have
no
other
remedy
and
they
gave
him
a
sum
in
place
of
no
remedy
whatsoever.
when
it
was
carried
over
into
england,
it
was
taken
as
an
alternative
remedy,
in
--
in
case
the
worker
had
no
other
common
law
remedy.
and
when
it
is
brought
into
this
country,
first,
the
employers
objected
to
it
and
then
they
waived
their
objection
rather
suddenly
and
that
--
and
the
court
might
infer
that
they
did
so
because
as
the
law
was
supposed
to
be
copied
from
the
english
model,
it
was
copied
not
accurately
and
it
became
the
exclusive
remedy
of
the
worker
rather
than
an
alternative
remedy.
workmen's
compensation
act
has
proved
litigious.
the
--
the
amounts
are
small
and
limited
at
a
time
when
the
workers
need
is
greatest.
and
the
worst
feature
about
it
is
that
it
is
a
limited
recovery
and
it
is
in
lieu
of
all
his
other
remedies.
i
think
i
--
i
think
i
am
done.
so
--
questions?
