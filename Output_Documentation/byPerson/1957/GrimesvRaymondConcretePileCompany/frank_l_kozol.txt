mr.
frank
l.
kozol
the
texas
tower
that's
involved
in
this
litigation
may
it
please
the
court,
is
an
artificial
structure,
three
photographs
which
are
contained
in
the
record.
it's
located
something
over
hundred
miles
beyond
cape
cod
on
the
georges
bank
and
was
specially
designed
to
constitute
a
warning
base,
a
radar
warning
base
sufficiently
out
to
sea,
so
that
our
land
based
aircraft
defenses
might
possibly
have
the
time
to
intercept
an
enemy
aircraft
invader.
my
brother
has
argued
to
you
in
part
of
this
argument
that
this
unusual
structure
of
which
there
are
now
several
and
others
are
going
up
in
all
parts
of
the
world
wherever
we
have
bases,
is
and
was
advancing
toward
the
reasons
that
after
it
was
constructed
by
the
bethlehem
steel
corporation
for
the
united
states
navy
on
contract
with
it.
it
was
told
from
the
bethlehem
yards,
in
east
boston
in
boston
harbor,
110
miles
out
of
sea
by
cod
to
the
place
that
had
been
selected
by
the
airforce
as
the
proper
place
to
establish
this
artificial
island.
and
a
picture
of
the
--
the
structure
being
told
is
also
contained
in
the
record.
the
plaintiff
was
engaged
from
the
pile
drivers
union,
it
does
work
on
this
structure
for
the
sake
of
helping
get
it
directed
at
its
permanent
side
of
the
georges
bank.
he
was
engaged
from
that
particular
union
for
a
fairly
sound
reason
because
in
that
union
they
have
the
men
who
had
the
skills
for
the
erection
of
structures
in
water,
in
maritime
waters.
he
went
to
work
at
the
east
boston
yards
and
work
there
for
three
weeks.
and
before
the
tug
came
to
tow
the
structure
out
to
sea,
he
signed
a
contract,
plaintiff,
which
is
in
the
record.
he
went
with
the
structure
out
to
sea
and
when
it
arrived
at
the
permanent
site
on
the
12th
of
july
in
1955,
immediately
went
to
work
to
get
the
structure
elevated
out
of
the
water.
and
one
of
the
exhibits,
the
photograph
shows
the
structure
out
of
the
water
either
20
feet
above
the
high
water
mark,
as
the
plaintiff
testified
or
60
feet
above
the
high
water
mark
as
other
witnesses
testified
but
in
any
event
forever
out
of
the
water.
the
structure
was
lifted
out
of
the
water
according
to
the
indisputable
testimony,
the
day
after
it
arrived
at
the
site.
it
was
lifted
out
of
the
water
on
the
12th
of
july.
the
photograph
of
the
record
is
as
of
the
20th
of
july,
the
accident
happened
on
the
21st
of
july.
it's
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
this
object,
whatever
it
may
be
called
and
in
effect
it's
an
artificial
island,
was
told,
as
a
convenient
means
of
transportation
that
might
--
and
notwithstanding,
that
it
was
forever
out
of
the
water.
several
days,
before
the
accident
occurred,
my
brother
argues
to
the
court
that
this
object
was
a
vessel.
the
argument
was
rejected
by
the
district
court
and
the
argument
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
most
rightly
so,
as
decisions
of
this
court
going
back
many,
many
years,
have
conclusively
established.
this
object
was
never
intended
as
an
instrumentality
for
transpiration
on
water.
the
incidental
fact
that
it
was
transported
over
the
water
to
reach
the
site
was
a
matter
of
convenience
but
it
was
not
built
nor
intended
nor
is
it
used
as
a
vessel.
plaintiff
was
taken
by
order
of
his
boss,
who
was
a
construction
superintendent,
not
an
officer
of
the
ship,
from
the
texas
tower
elevated
high
above
the
water
in
a
cargo
net
pull
into
a
tug
and
sent
out
to
help
more
barge.
and
great
emphasis
was
placed
at
the
trial
upon
the
language
in
the
defense
bases
act,
which
talks
of
all
work
preparatory
and
ancillary
to
the
main
task
of
constructing
a
defense
base.
the
plaintiff
himself,
at
no
time
claim
to
be
a
member
of
a
crew.
the
record
will
indicate
that
he
was
asked
on
several
occasions
at
the
trial
and
interrogatories,
“what
were
you?
what
was
your
job?
what
where
you
at
the
time
of
your
injury”
and
his
answer
was
consistently,
“i
was
a
pile
driver.”
he's
a
pile
driver
to
this
day.
the
record
indicates
that
he's
the
foreman
of
the
pile
driver
on
two
other
texas
towers
that
the
government
is
building.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
he
went
out
on
a
barge,
accompanied
with
several
other
men
under
orders
of
his
superintendent
to
help
anchor
it,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
that's
exactly
what
he
did
for
six
hours
on
the
barge.
he
work
winches,
he
gave
signals,
the
barge
had
on
it
a
load
of
sand
and
gravel
that
was
vitally
necessary
in
order
to
make
concrete,
in
order
to
fill
this
enormous
caissons
that
go
down
through
the
water
and
40
feet
into
the
soil.
and
that's
how
this
structure
is
able
to
stand
there
forever,
withstand
all
the
storms
in
the
atlantic
ocean
and
serve
as
an
aircraft
defense
radar
warning
base
for
the
nation.
he
certainly,
for
the
six
hours
that
he's
on
the
barge
was
doing
work
which
seamen
or
crew
members
sometimes
do.
but
in
my
conception
of
the
law,
as
i
understand
the
cases
of
this
court
and
the
cases
of
the
courts
of
appeals
which
i
try
to
follow,
the
mandates
of
this
court,
the
particular
task
that
he
was
doing
on
the
barge
is
not
to
terminate
it
as
to
what
his
status
was
at
the
time
of
his
injury.
my
brother
has
seen
fit
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
jones
act
has
been
considered,
a
piece
of
legislation
intended
to
give
very
careful
protection
to
men
on
the
high
seas,
seaman.
this
court
has
stated
and
i
think
it's
now
beyond
argument
that
after
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
is
passed
the
word
seaman
was
confined
most
carefully
to
members
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
the
most
recent
decision
of
this
subject
matter
was
in
the
last
term
of
the
court,
senko
against
la
crosse
in
which
the
court
considered
the
entire
subject
matter
and
pointed
out
that
perhaps
the
profession
in
the
court's
had
not
properly
understood
the
impact
of
this
court's
decision
in
chicago
railroad
against
bassett
which
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
problem
of
who
is
and
who
is
not
a
member
of
a
crew,
was
taken
out.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
it
might
have
made
a
difference,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
context
of
his
entire
employment
obligation
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
working
on
the
barge
instead
of
six
hours,
let
us
say
six
days
or
six
weeks
or
even
six
months.
i
would
have
to
know,
and
i
think
the
teaching
of
this
court
indicates
this,
what
was
the
totality
of
his
employment
obligation?
now,
i
should
say
that
if
we
had
a
situation
where
a
man
was
working
on
a
barge
for
six
weeks,
you
might
have
to
conclude
and
i
think
it
probably
would
have
to
conclude,
that
his
job
is
changed.
he
was
hired
as
a
pile
driver
but
his
employer
exercised
his
employer's
privilege
of
changing
his
job
and
he
converted
him
from
a
pile
driver
into
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
and
i
do
not
deny
that
the
barge
was
a
vessel.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
i
think
it
would
make
--
one
--
i
alter
a
difference.
i
think
he
would
still
be
covered
by
the
defense
bases
act
because
the
work
on
the
barge
depends
upon
his
status
at
the
time
that
he
was
injured.
at
the
time
he
was
injured
not
withstanding
his
transitory
assignment
to
do
the
work
of
a
seaman
for
six
hours,
he
was
nevertheless
a
pile
driver.
that's
the
position
i
take,
if
your
honor
please
and
i
think
the
case
is
supportive.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
well,
i
wish
i
were
able
to
give
a
mathematical
or
yardstick
rule
to
that
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
do
that.
i
would
say
that
if
instead
of
working
for
six
hours,
he
worked
for
six
minutes,
there's
no
question
about
it.
i
would
say,
that
where
he
worked
several
weeks
as
a
pile
driver
and
on
the
obvious
pattern
of
this
case
was
sent
to
do
a
transitory
job
in
order
that
he
might
continue
to
do
his
basic
job
which
is
to
sink
the
case
on
to
set
up
the
towers
that
unquestionably,
he
cannot
be
considered
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
if
he
worked
for
six
days,
i
would
have
to
know
what
is
the
totality
of
his
employment
obligations
and
if
he
worked
for
six
weeks,
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
the
nature
of
his
job
had
been
changed
by
his
employer.
now
--
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
if
he
worked
for
six
weeks.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
if
he
worked
for
six
days.
i
don't
know.
i'd
have
to
know
the
whole
pattern.
if
you
ask
me
that
this
work
--
if
this
worker
here
was
put
on
that
barge
for
six
days
and
then
it
was
hurt
returning
to
his
job,
i
would
say
your
honors
that
that
is
not
a
jury
question
and
he
is
still
a
pile
driver.
if
he
was
on
the
barge
for
six
weeks,
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances
it
becomes
beyond
argument
that
his
employer
had
changed
his
job
from
a
pile
driver
to
the
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
no.
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
of
it,
your
honor.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
there
can't
be
any
argument
that
it
was
anything
other
than
a
pile
driver
because
it's
clear
on
the
testimony.
and
the
testimony
is
beyond
dispute
that
his
job
on
this
barge
was
a
transitory
job
within
the
concept
of
specific
language
in
the
defense
bases
act
which
talks
of
work
preparatory
and
ancillary
to
the
construction
of
the
base.
that's
exactly
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
that's
right.
and
your
honor
will
recall,
that
i
said
if
you
were
there
for
six
days
under
these
facts,
i
would
say
that
he
was
a
pile
driver
and
not
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
if
there
was
six
weeks.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
yes.
yes,
your
honor.[laughs]
now,
my
brother
has
indicated
that
he
has
a
special
regard
for
the
jones
act.
there's
some
sacred
piece
of
litigation.
he
hasn't
used
that
language.
that's
my
own
characterization
of
it.
the
jones
act
was
passed
in
1920
for
now,
perfectly
clear
on
obvious
reasons
and
very
salutary
ones.
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
was
passed
in
1937
and
this
court
indicated,
that
the
passage
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
changed
the
meaning
of
the
word
“seaman”
in
the
jones
act
and
thenceforth
confined
it
to
members
of
a
crew
of
any
vessel
and
came
a
decision
which
indicated
that
masters
are
entitled
to
the
very
same
protection
as
members
of
crew
and
lump
them
all
together.
we
were
approaching
the
war
in
1940,
the
lease
lend
act
had
gone
into
effect
and
the
nation
was
preparing
for
the
inevitable.
president
roosevelt
has
indicated
there
was
a
grave
danger
and
we
went
ahead
and
try
to
protect
ourselves
by
building
bases
outside
the
continent
of
united
states.
the
court
will
recall
that
we
started
with
bermuda
and
some
of
the
other
islands.
congress
passed
an
act
incidentally,
very
vigorously
sponsored
by
senator
pepper
in
order
to
induce
skilled
american
workers
to
go
out
into
those
hazardous
areas
and
that
was
in
1940.
and
build
our
defense
bases.
and
then
came
pearl
harbor,
we're
at
war
and
the
act
was
found
to
be
insufficient,
so
the
congress
went
ahead
and
passed
the
defense
bases
act
which
is
amended
to
the
1940
act
in
december
1942.
and
the
purpose
of
it
from
the
congressional
debates,
some
of
which
i
have
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
my
brief
were
to
make
certain
that
we
got
our
bases
built
and
that
workers
who
were
hurt
or
killed
would
have
quick
sure
certain
protection
for
themselves
and
their
families.
i
don't
suppose
this
court
took
certiorari
of
what
is
essentially
a
case
of
very
minor
personal
injuries
in
order
to
decide
the
merits
in
this
particular
case.
it
seems
to
be
now
that
in
light
of
the
overpowering
purposes
of
the
defense
bases
act
and
the
fact
that
we
are
enlarging
our
defense
bases
all
over
the
world
that
this
court
may
take
this
case
as
the
opportunity
to
instruct
the
bar
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
as
to
what
standards
to
use
in
the
determination
or
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
decide
whether
a
person
who
comes
in
to
court
as
a
plaintiff
is
a
member
of
a
crew.
and
if
a
court
can
determine
that
on
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
to
intelligently
instruct
the
jury
so
that
a
jury
of
untrained
layman
and
apply
some
standards
and
determine
whether
a
claimant
is
or
is
not
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
and
just
as
in
the
negligence
cases,
to
which
allusion
was
made
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
senko
case
if
the
evidence
is
not
sufficient,
just
as
i
sincerely
believe
that
it
is
not
sufficient
here,
a
court
is
to
direct
a
verdict
and
where
it
is
sufficient
the
findings
of
the
trier
of
facts
whether
it
would
be
a
commissioner
as
it
was
in
the
bassett
case
or
a
jury
as
its
been
in
so
many
other
cases,
should
stand
whether
or
not
the
appellate
court
likes
the
result.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
i
am
prepared,
if
your
honor
please,
to
argue
in
support
of
the
judgment
by
both
of
them.
i
do
not
think
judge
wyzanski
made
any
mistake
at
all
and
i
do
not
subscribe
to
my
brother's
characterization
of
his
mental
processes.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
that's
right.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
judge
wyzanski,
stated
that
under
the
defenses
bases
act,
having
in
mind
the
particular
provision
of
that
statue
with
talks
of
work
preparatory
and
ancillary
to
the
main
provision
that
this
man
could
not
recover
under
the
jones
act.
he
went
on
to
say
that
if
this
man
worked
for
another
employer,
he
might
be
considered
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
and
that
language
at
first
flash
maybe
misleading.
if
this
man,
as
i
understand
judge
wyzanski's
position,
worked
for
a
navigation
company
and
his
employment
was
to
work
on
the
barge.
he
would
be
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
my
brother's
point
however
was,
that
judge
wyzanski
didn't
observed
the
exclusion
of
the
defense
bases
act
which
excludes
from
its
coverage
masters
and
members
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
but
relied
on
the
identical
exclusion
in
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
well,
i
don't
believe
for
a
minute
that
judge
wyzanski
overlooked
the
exclusion
in
the
defense
bases
act
nor
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
he
did
or
not
because
the
exclusion
in
each
of
the
two
statutes
are
absolutely
identical.
and
if
he
had
overlooked
them
both,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
where
the
court's
ruling
is
correct.
this
court
has
never
considered
itself
bound
by
the
court's
reasons
even
if
they
did
wrong.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
yes,
he
said
that.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
well,
in
the
sense
perhaps
he
was.
he
was
saying
that
this
worker
--
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
they
wrote
the
back
of
this,
your
honor.
we
observed
the
dissenting
opinion
was
printed
first
then
came
the
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
by
chief
judge
magruder
and
justice
woodbury.
the
court
of
--
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
pretty
clearly,
that
on
no
construction
of
the
facts
whatsoever
could
this
man
be
considered
to
be
a
member
of
a
crew
of
any
vessel.
and
the
court
start
its
opinion
with
some
such
language
as
to
indicate
that
it
will
be
a
perfectly
futile
act,
to
send
it
back
to
--
for
jury
to
termination
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
well,
as
i
indicated
before,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
also
boast
for
a
minuted
that
this
court
was
interested
in
this
case
purely
because
the
special
facts
of
this
case
except
as
those
special
facts
give
the
court
an
opportunity
which
would
be
extremely
salutary
and
very
helpful
to
the
bar
and
the
courts
to
state
the
principles
that
are
to
govern
the
determination
by
trial
judges,
by
juries
and
by
courts
of
appeals
of
who
is
and
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
crew
of
any
vessel.
it
is
a
fact
that
some
of
the
cases
have
indicated
that
some
over
emphasis
should
be
made
on
what
the
individuals
doing
at
the
moment
he
was
hurt.
and
other
cases
have
indicated
that
it
makes
no
difference
whatever,
where
he
was
or
what
he
was
doing
at
the
moment
he
was
hurt
but
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
he
had
a
permanent
connection
with
a
vessel,
as
defined
by
this
court,
which
is
not
a
structure
like
a
texas
tower,
not
even
a
floating
dry
dock
but
a
vessel
in
its
true
sense.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
i
think
the
timekeeper
indicate
that
i
have
about
eight
or
10
minutes
left.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
we
have
here
a
case,
may
it
please
the
court
where
a
workmen
who
consciously
and
intentionally
hide
himself
out
as
pile
driver
and
went
out
into
the
ocean
to
help
construct
a
defense
base
is
except
as
he
may
be
found
to
be
a
member
of
a
crew
on
sufficient
evidence
to
support
such
a
finding
is
covered
by
the
humane
protective
provisions
of
the
workmen's
compensation
statute,
which
congress
established
under
the
defense
bases
act
as
the
sole
and
exclusive
remedy
for
all
american
workers
who
went
out
to
work
on
such
bases
which
were
to
be
constructed
on
the
contracts
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
agency
thereof,
precisely
such
as
happened
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
suits
the
plaintiff's
purpose
because
he
received
minor
injuries
and
has
collected
this
$200
under
workmen's
compensation
to
see
if
he
can
gamble
for
a
better
result
from
a
jury
and
the
only
way
to
possibly
achieve
that
result
is
if
he
can
get
a
jury
--
get
to
a
jury
and
persuade
the
jury
to
hold
him
to
be
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel.
this
is
because
for
six
hours,
as
the
chief
justice
has
brought
out
in
your
searching
question,
he
worked
on
the
barge,
doing
a
work
that
is
frequently
and
commonly
done
by
seaman
who
are
members
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel.
but
i
have
indicated
in
my
answers
and
i
am
certain
that
the
case
support
my
position
that
that
is
not
determinative
nor
significant
even
though
i
can
give
mathematical
formulas
to
what
point
the
status
of
the
individual
changes.
i
do
know
this
however,
that
there
are
certain
criteria
which
this
court
has
seized
upon
over
and
over
and
over
again
most
recently
in
the
senko
case,
which
was
decided
last
term.
one
of
those
is
permanent
connection
with
a
vessel.
the
majority
opinion
on
the
senko
case
setup
three
tests
and
i've
quoted
the
language
on
page
26
of
our
brief.
the
first
one
was
that
there
was
a
testimony
introduced
by
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
tending
to
show
that
he's
employed
almost
solely
on
the
dredge
which
was
the
vessel
involved
in
that
case.
in
our
case,
the
testimony
is
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
not
employed
almost
solely
on
the
barge.
and
that's
why
my
brother
has
to
resort
to
the
argument
that
the
texas
tower
is
a
vessel
which
i
argue
most
sincerely
and
obviously
was
not.
the
second
test
is
if
the
duties
of
the
petitioner
were
primarily
to
maintain
the
dredge
during
its
anchorage
for
its
future
trips.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
no
such
duties
whatsoever.
its
perfectly
clear
and
beyond
doubt
on
the
record
that
the
duties
of
this
petitioner
was
to
help
construct
a
defense
base
in
line
with
his
normal
duties
as
a
pile
driver
and
what
he
was
doing
on
the
barge
was
a
casual
transitory
of
thermal
task,
preparatory
and
ancillary
to
his
main
job.
and
the
third
test
is
that
he
would
have
a
significant
navigational
function
once
the
instrumentality,
which
is
called
the
“vessel
is
put
into
transit.”
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
would
have
no
such
significant
function
whatsoever.
the
argument
that
the
jones
act
should
be
expanded
as
widely
as
possible,
i
most
respectfully
submit,
misses
the
mark.
the
congress
intended
our
defense
base
workers
to
have
the
protection
of
a
workmen's
compensation
act
where
they
need
not
rely
upon
negligence
as
they
must
under
the
jones
act.
what
about
the
next
case
that's
waiting
in
line
in
my
office
with
my
brother
of
the
defense
base
worker
who
was
killed
without
negligence?
is
he
to
be
left
--
his
family
to
be
left
entirely
without
any
protection?
that
certainly
was
not
the
purpose
in
the
intent
of
congress.
under
compensation
act,
he
would
covered
if
the
broad
principle
recently
established
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
prevails
as
i'm
quite
sure
it
will
even
if
he
was
shot
to
death
as
happened
in
a
massachusetts
case
by
some
evil
intention
of
a
person
engaged
in
target
practice.
but
it
--
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
election
of
remedies.
mr.
frank
l.
kozol
because
we're
dealing
here
with
two
mutually
exclusive
federal
statutes,
your
honor.
and
mr.
justice
douglas
has
pointed
that
out
most
significantly
in
a
note
in
norton
and
warner
where
the
court
in
a
majority
opinion,
points
out
the
problem
that
was
raised
by
the
jensen
case.
here,
he
has
no
election
of
remedies.
it's
purely
a
case
of
determining
which
statute
covers
him.
if
he
truly
is
a
seaman,
as
this
court
has
now
defined
in
the
light
of
the
longshoremen's
act
which
means
he
must
be
a
member
or
a
crew
of
a
vessel,
then
jones
act
is
his
remedy
and
if
he
fails
to
prove
negligence,
he's
out.
if
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
crew
of
a
vessel,
his
exclusive
remedy
is
under
the
defense
bases
act
which
incorporated
the
entire
compensation
system
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
now,
i
have
taken
the
liberty
and
most
respectfully
urge
upon
your
court
--
upon
the
court
that
the
scope
and
coverage
of
the
compensation
act
should
be
construed
as
broadly
as
possible.
and
the
cases
of
this
court
have
indicated
from
timely
memorial
that
the
basic
purposes
of
a
statute
like
the
defense
bases
act
should
be
broadly
construed
whereas
the
exclusions
to
it
such
as
the
exclusion
of
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
should
be
most
narrowly
construed.
so
as
to
give
this
protection
sure,
certain
and
rapid
to
all
workers
who
are
killed
or
injured
to
the
construction
of
a
defense
bases.
and
because
i
think
that
the
case
has
significance,
broader
than
the
particular
facts
or
the
particular
decision
here,
i
have
taken
the
liberty
and
i
respectfully
invite
the
court's
attention
to
state
--
restate
what
i
believe
the
teachings
of
this
court
had
been
and
i
believe
that
if
they
are
restated
in
some
such
manner
as
i
have
dared
to
do
on
page
43
conclusion
(a)
of
our
brief,
that
the
country
will
be
well-guided
and
this
court
will
not
further
be
troubled
as
much
as
it
has
been
with
petition
for
certiorari
to
--
in
cases
of
this
nature,
as
similar
to
the
fela
cases
where
the
principal
issue
as
it
is
here
is,
is
there
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
to
establish
negligence
or
a
status
of
an
individual?
it
is
to
be
kept
in
mind
i
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
six
hours
of
this
man's
work
on
the
barge
were
all
completed
and
done
for
forever
before
the
accident
happened.
he
was
back
on
his
way
in
transit.
a
situation
specifically
covered
by
the
defense
bases
act
which
covers
in
transportation
to
his
principal
job
on
the
tower
and
have
almost
gotten
there
when
the
tug
boats
swung
with
the
motion
sea
and
struck
him
and
caused
his
minor
injuries.
all
concept
of
this
man
having
been
a
member
of
a
crew
of
a
vessel
ended
when
that
job
was
done.
and
i
say,
may
it
please
the
court,
never
began
because
i
do
not
subscribe
to
the
principle
of
shifting
status
such
as
my
brother
(inaudible).
