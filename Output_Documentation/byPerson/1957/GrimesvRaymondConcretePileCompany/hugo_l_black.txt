justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
now
depending
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
judge
wyzanski's
holding
or
that
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
i
thought
in
your
--
i
--
i
asked
because
i
thought
in
your
brief,
you
said
the
only
place
is
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
crew.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
that
was
not
the
basis
on
which
judge
wyzanski
decided
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
he
decided
it
was
under
the
defense
bases
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
am
i
wrong?
i
--
i
misunderstood
judge
wyzanski
because
i'm
looking
at
here
on
page
19
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
says
his
remedy
is
not
by
suit
in
this
court
under
the
jones
act
even
though
he's
working
for
another
employer
or
an
employee
not
having
a
defense
bases
contract,
i
would
agree
that
he
might
be
regarded
as
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
barge
entitled
under
those
circumstances,
the
useful
method
such
as
the
jones
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
he
was
excluding
him
from
recovering
on
the
ground
that
he
just
went
under
the
jones
act
because
he
is
under
the
translation
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that?
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
haven't
been
quite
clear
that
a
per
curiam
opinion
[laughs]
