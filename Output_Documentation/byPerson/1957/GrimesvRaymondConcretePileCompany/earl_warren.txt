what
was
he
doing
on

chief

earl
warren
mr.
kozol,
supposed
that
not
only
for
this
one
day
but
supposed
for
a
great
many
days
he
had
been
working
on
this
barge
each
day,
anchoring
it
as
--
as
a
part
of
this
job,
would
that
made
any
difference
at
all
to
you?

jury
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
--
if
he
was
there
for
six
days,
wouldn't
be
ancillary
to
the
construction
of
the
base
just
the
same?
chief

but
you
thought
there
might
be
a

there.
