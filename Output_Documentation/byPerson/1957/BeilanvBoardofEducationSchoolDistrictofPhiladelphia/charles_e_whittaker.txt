how
long
did
the
(inaudible)

(inaudible)

charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles

(inaudible)
whether
or

(inaudible)

now,
did
he

and
have
been
incompetent
(inaudible)
in
your
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
(inaudible)
--
do
not
the
charges
make
the
real
issue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now
your
dealing
with
the
weight
of
evidence
there,
aren't
you?
the
charges
do
present
the
issue,
do
they
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
one
has
an
action
of
remedy,
his
adversary
can't
complain
that
he
chose
one
rather
than
the
other
as
i
would
think.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
though
it
also
adds
up
to
incompetency?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rhoads,
do
you
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
communist
party
was
lawfully
on
the
ballot
in
1944,
has
any
real
significance
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
suppose
just
for
an
example
that
it
was
there
fraudulently
and
its
true
colors
were
later
determined.
might
it
then
not
be
highly
relevant
to
determine
whether
or
not
one
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
it
at
a
later
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
that
premise
is
a
distinguishing
basis
for
eliminating
such
question
with
respect
to
those
who
were
still
honorable
like
the
republican
and
democratic
parties?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
he
discharged?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
there
are
two
differences
between
this
case
and
the
davis
case
as
i
see
it.
one
is
that
in
the
davis
case,
the
responsible
officials
of
the
university
called
dr.
davis
in
and
asked
him
to
answer
to
them
whether
or
not
he
was
or
ever
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
no
statute
was
involved
but
only
the
tenure
contract
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
dischargeable
depended
upon
whether
or
not
there
was,
"adequate
cause",
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
those
are
two
distinctions.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
