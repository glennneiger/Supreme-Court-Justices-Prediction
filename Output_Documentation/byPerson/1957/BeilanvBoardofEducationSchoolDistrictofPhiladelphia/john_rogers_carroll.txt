mr.
john
rogers
carroll
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
court
please.
this
case
arises
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
the
issue
involved
is
whether
a
school
teacher,
public
school
teacher,
maybe
dismissed
from
his
job
on
the
ground
of
the
incompetency
without
a
hearing
on
his
competency
simply
because
he
refused
to
answer
a
question
relating
to
past
communist
affiliations.
the
question
in
this
case,
unlike
others
your
honors
have
had,
was
not
asked
formally
in
the
form
of
a
note
or
before
a
congressional
committee
but
informally
by
his
administrative
superior,
the
superintendent
of
schools.
the
facts
which
gave
rise
to
this
situation
are
briefly
these.
petitioner
was
appointed
a
public
teacher
in
philadelphia
on
february
17th,
1930.
for
23
years
thereafter,
he
continued
to
teach
school
and
was
continually
rated
competent
in
accordance
with
the
official
rating
system.
in
may
--
pardon
me
--
june
of
1952,
he
received
the
summons
from
his
superintendent,
the
district
superintendent
schools
to
appear
at
the
superintendent's
office
to
discuss
what
the
superintendent
described
on
his
letter
as
a
matter
of
importance.
mr.
beilan
of
course
appeared.
superintendent
told
mr.
beilan
at
that
time
that
he
had
certain
information
which
bore
upon
mr.
beilan's
fitness
to
continue
to
be
a
teacher.
mr.
beilan
invited
him
to
tell
what
that
information
was
and
what
he
had
on
his
mind.the
superintendent
agreed
to
and
did
ask
one
question
to
wit.
“were
you
in
1944
press
director
of
the
professional
section
of
the
communist
political
association?”
mr.
beilan
asked
leave
to
consult
a
counsel.
and
as
the
superintendent
testified,
that
was
entirely
satisfactory
to
him.
mr.
beilan
thereupon
left
and
did
consult
counsel.
nothing
happened
until
about
four
months
later
in
october.
specifically
on
the
14th
of
october,
1952,
another
similar
letter
was
directed
to
mr.
beilan
by
the
superintendent.
he
came
again
and
then
told
the
superintendent
that
counsel
had
advised
him
that
he
could
not
legally
be
asked
questions
such
as
that.
at
that
point
the
superintendent
said,
“i
don't
want
you
to
think
this
is
a
matter
of
idle
curiosity
on
my
part.
this
is
a
serious
and
important
question
of
your
fitness.
and
your
persistent
refusal
may
lead
to
your
dismissal.”
mr.
beilan
nevertheless
refused
to
answer
the
question.
he
went
back
to
school
and
he
continued
in
his
job
teaching
english
at
simon
gratz
high
school,
philadelphia,
and
continued
to
be
rated
competent
for
13
months.
superintendent
permitted
those
efficiency
ratings
to
be
entered
on
his
records.
your
honors,
if
you
care
to
note,
we'll
see
at
page
74
of
the
record
that
we
have
inserted
photostatic
copies
of
those
23
years
of
efficient
ratings.
but,
then
came
the
committee
on
un-american
activities.
november
16th
of
1953,
only
13
months
after
his
last
interview
with
the
superintendent,
mr.
beilan
was
summoned
along
with
almost
30
other
philadelphia
school
teachers
to
public
televised
hearings
in
philadelphia.
i'm
sure
that
your
honors
are
by
now
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
proceedings
of
that
committee
particularly
from
the
watkins
case,
that
it
takes
very
little
imagination
to
conjure
up
a
picture
of
what
happened
in
our
district
courtroom
that
day.
in
fact,
it
was
three
days
your
honor.
quite
naturally
it
was
highly
publicized
in
advance.
the
first
witness
in
accordance
with
the
committee's
custom
was
a
friendly
witness
and
mrs.
dorothy
funn,
i
recall,
who
described
in
great
detail
her
intimate
connection
with
the
communist
party
and
in
generous
generality,
the
influence
of
communism
on
school
children.
of
course
mrs.
funn
was
from
new
york,
but
this
did
not
bother
the
committee.
they
needed
this
purpose
to
their
investigation.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
said
your
honor
that
it
precipitated
the
dismissal
in
this
case.
as
it
happened
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
the
charges
which
were
sustained
by
the
board
of
education
included
two
statements
of
fact.
one,
that
it
refused
to
answer
dr.
hoyer's
question
and
two,
that
he
re
--
that
he
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
committee.
those
charges
were
sustained
by
the
board
of
education
by
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction
but
unnecessary
to
decide
said
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
under
the
(inaudible)
school,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
jones
is
absolutely
right.
of
course
i
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
(voice
overlap)
thoroughly
with
this
dissent.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
it
must
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
and
that
may
have
happened.
except
that,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
on
arraignment
would
then
find
it
necessary
to
consider
the
application
of
slochower
which
they
did
not
do
in
this
opinion
below.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
and
that
would
--
that
it
abide
your
honors'
rule.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
yes
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
certainly
is
and
the
--
the
result,
i
would
trust,
should
your
honors
reverse
on
this
case.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
no,
i
--
i
don't
accept.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
would
then
be
squarely
faced
with
the
questions
they
left
undecided.
and
that
would
be
for
them
to
decide
i
would
hope
in
accordance
with
slochower.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
slochower
applies
to
the
question
they
did
not
decide.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
appearance
before
the
committee.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
no,
sir.
they'd
have
to
invent
something
new.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
you
mean
that
he
refused
to
testify
before
the
board
of
education
or
you're
talking
now
about
the
superintendent.
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
yes.
well,
that's
the
question
with
which
your
honors
are
presented,
and
i
think
it's
more
konigsberg
than
garner.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
don't
think
it
would
be
slochower
because
your
honor
writing
the
opinion
in
slochower,
said
that
it
would
be
quite
a
different
matter
where
the
questions
asked
before
the
local
school
authorities.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
garner,
i
think,
is
an
entirely
different
situation
your
honor.
there,
and
it
points
up
i
think,
the
big
difference
between
this
case
and
that
one.
in
garner,
the
state
of
california
had
eight
years
previous
to
the
questioning
enacted
a
statute
prohibiting
public
employees
from
being
members
of
any
sort
of
communist
organization.
they
then
amended
the
charter
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
to
permit
in
fact
to
require
disclosures
such
as
the
disclosures
in
garner.
now,
there
you
have
a
specific
law
requiring
disclosure
by
public
employees
of
affiliations
which
had
at
the
time
of
the
supposed
affiliation
been
prohibited
by
law
for
public
employees.
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
employees
in
california
knew
that
they
were
forbidden
to
join
this
organization.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
yes
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
correct
sir,
but
the
answer
that
i
was
giving
to
mr.
justice
clark
is
this.
that
the
disclosure
which
was
specifically
required
by
the
los
angeles
charter
for
employees
was
the
disclosure
of
things
that
they
knew
eight
years
previously
because
of
the
statute,
they
couldn't
do.
now,
in
pennsylvania
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
we
never
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
would
say
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
no
sir,
but
i
do
say
this
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that
it
makes
for
fairness.
i
say
it's
unfair
for
pennsylvania
to
decide
in
1952
that
these
organizations
were
bad
in
1944
and
that
we
can
make
inquiries
about
them
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
without
prior
warning.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
this
--
the
matter
to
which
these
questions
related
your
honor
was
just
as
innocent
as
those
of
which
your
honor
wrote
in
professor
sweezy's
case.
they
were
perfectly
innocent
associations.
the
reason
they
can't
ask
him
does
not
rest
upon
the
fact
that
these
were
prohibited
by
law
but
rather
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
questioning
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
is
an
inhibition
of
the
free
association.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
those
are
different
things
your
honor.
however,
what
i
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
when
the
questioning
takes
the
form
it
did
here
and
relates
to
political
association
or
anything
within
the
first
amendment
area,
then
you
have
a
different
story.
i
think
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
limit
it
here,
sir,
to
those
types
of
questions
asked
about
past
communist
affiliations
and
the
type
as
to
professor
sweezy
in
his
case
against
new
hampshire.
that
is
at
least
without
trying
to
define
the
limits
of
the
first
amendment.
i'd
say
those
are
clearly
within
it.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
under
my
theory,
sir?
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
think
not.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
now
that
would
be
a
different
story
had
it
been
done
as
was
in
garner.
but
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
will
depart
from
that
if
i
may
then,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
at
page
16
your
honor,
footnote
14.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
section
1-108
of
the
pennsylvania
school
code
which
provides
no
religious
or
a
political
test
or
qualification
shall
be
required
of
any
director,
visitor,
superintendent,
teacher,
or
other
officer,
appointee,
or
employee
in
a
public
schools
of
this
commonwealth.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
in
--
if
you're
talking
now
about
the
specific
question
that
was
asked
of
this
teacher,
your
honor,
remember
it
related
to
the
cpa,
the
communist
political
association
and
not
the
party.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
now
even
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
even
in
dennis,
your
honors
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
made
an
exception
for
that.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i'd
say
no
sir
because
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
particularly
in
view
of
section
4
(f)
of
the
internal
security
act
and
particularly
as
your
honors
have
interpreted
the
smith
act
in
yates,
these
are
at
least
membership
and
officership
are
purely
taken
out
of
the
punishable
realm.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
on
its
face,
sir,
no.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
but
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
yes,
sir,
they
did.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
until
december
of
1951
when
the
statute
which
we
know
as
the
musmanno
act,
that
communist
party
was
outlawed
in
pennsylvania.
as
of
1944
and
in
the
1948
elections,
they
were
on
the
ballots
in
pennsylvania.
but
if
i
may
stick
for
a
moment
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
started
to
say
it
was
the
committee's
visit
to
philadelphia
that
really
precipitated
the
firing.
five
days
later,
26
teachers
were
all
suspended.
we
then
of
course
had
a
hearing
before
the
board
of
education
on
the
question
of
our
dismissal.
the
charges
which
are
printed
at
pages
46
of
the
record,
were
simply,
they
refused
to
answer
the
superintendent,
their
plea
to
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
committee.
two
legal
conclusions
were
drawn
from
us,
incompetency
and
willful,
and
persistant
violation
of
the
school
laws.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
those
were
the
conclusions
of
the
charges.
the
facts
of
the
charges
were
the
two
refusals.
the
two
conclusions
drawn
were
incompetency
and
persistent
and
willful
violation
of
the
school
laws.
now,
of
course,
we
lost
before
the
board
of
education
by
a
rule
of
14-to-1.
the
state
superintendent,
of
the
construction,
and
before
whom
all
of
these
same
questions
were
raised
also
decided
against
us.
his
opinion,
as
well
as
that
in
companion
case,
(inaudible)
are
also
printed
in
the
record.
i
think
your
honors
will
see
from
those
opinions,
there's
total
free
occupation
to
the
question
of
loyalty
and
no
concern
about
actual
competency
in
any
meaningful
sentence.
we
took
an
appeal
at
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
philadelphia
as
provided
by
statute
and
there
we
won
for
the
first
time.
the
court
of
common
pleas'
opinion
is
also
printed
in
the
record.
then
the
board
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
i
have
described
the
proceedings
there.
as
your
honors
know,
there
are
four
separate
opinions
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
this
case.
the
majority
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
chidsey,
practically
is
on
the
same
grounds
as
that
of
the
state
superintendent.
chief
justice
jones,
then
justice
jones
dissented
on
the
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
justice
bell
dissented
on
the
ground
that
he
thought
the
wrong
pennsylvania
statute
was
followed,
that
this
being
a
loyalty
proceeding
should
have
been
under
the
exclusive
provisions
of
the
pennsylvania
loyalty
act.
now,
mr.
justice
musmanno
wrote
what
he
calls
an
opinion
concurring
with
preservations.
he
likes
the
majority
opinion
but
finds
it
regrettable
where
the
majority
cites
two
cases
of
commonwealth
ex
rel.
roth
against
musmanno
and
schlesinger's
petition
in
both
of
which
he
was
the
respondent
prior
to
his
election
to
the
bench.
he
says
that
if
in
those
cases
roth
and
schlesinger
were
denied
due
process,
then
so
was
beilan.
now,
i
am
in
some
doubt
as
to
whether
that's
really
a
concurring
opinion
or
a
dissenting
opinion
since
majority
says
it's
the
law
of
pennsylvania
and
he
says
it's
a
shame
that
they
have
to
rely
on
these
cases
because
they
were
certainly
in
the
same
due
process
position
as
beilan.
the
first
argument
that
we
make
to
your
honors
is
this.
that
you
simply
cannot
fire
a
competent
school
teacher
on
the
ground
of
incompetency
without
a
hearing
on
competency.
they
gave
him
no
such
hearing.
we
had
a
formal
hearing
before
the
board
of
education
but
the
only
testimony,
the
only
relevant
issue
was
whether
he
refused
to
answer.
now,
i
said
that
in
the
sheerest
sense,
that
is
a
denial
of
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
real
issue
on
which
you're
being
fired.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
your
honor
now
refers
to
his
refusal
to
answer
the
superintendent's
question.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
if
there
is
any
rational
evidence
to
be
found
in
that
refusal,
rational
evidence
of
the
incompetency,
then
i
would
say
that
your
honor
is
correct.
but
our
contention
is
that
there
is
none.
now,
we
have
this
situation
in
pennsylvania.
we
have
since
1951
a
very
carefully
drawn
comprehensive
loyalty
act
which
covers
all
state
employees
and
specifically
school
teachers,
the
board
assiduously
avoided
using
that
act.
superintendent
said
all
these
questions
had
to
do
with
this
area
of
communist
association.
if
that
was
an
interest,
then
he
could
have
proceeded
under
the
exclusive
provisions
of
that
act.
he
didn't.
instead
they
chose
to
charge
simply
the
refusal
to
answer
as
incompetency.
now,
what's
the
evidence
in
this
record?
i've
already
invited
your
honors'
attention
to
petitioner's
exhibit
1
at
page
74,
which
shows
23
consecutive
years
of
competent
ratings.
in
addition,
your
honors
will
note
that
the
last
rating
is
made
10
days
after
he
was
publicly
suspended
by
the
superintendent.
i've
also
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
the
section
of
the
pennsylvania
school
law
which
requires
that
in
competency
cases,
the
issue
is
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
official
rating
cards.
they
just
made
up
the
rating
card
in
which
they
said
refusal
to
answer
is
incompetency.
in
addition
to
that
i
suggest
that
the
fact
unlike
konigsberg
where
your
honor
mr.
justice
harlan
made
some
point
of
the
rule
that
the
applicant
for
the
bar
had
the
burden
of
proving
his
good
moral
qualifications.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
we
had
an
incumbent
teacher
with
tenure
and
one
of
the
important
incidents
of
that
tenure
is
that
in
any
charge
against
him,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
board
of
education
to
show
by
preponderance
in
the
evidence
that
he
did
commit
the
act
which
makes
it
different.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
it
could
be
changed
by
the
legislature,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
pennsylvania
that
would
prohibit
such
a
legislative
change.
however,
this
is
the
way
that
tenure
was
at
this
time
and
remains.
now
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
yes
sir.
that
was
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
the
procedural
requirements
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
copied
all
the
relevant
sections
of
that
statute
both
in
the
petition
and
brief.
and
section
1123
of
the
pennsylvania
school
code
provides
the
only
valid
courses
for
termination
of
a
contract
heretofore
or
hereafter
entered
into
with
a
professional
employee
shall
be
immorality,
incompetency,
intemperance,
cruelty,
persistent,
negligence,
mental
derangement,
persistent,
and
willful
violation
of
the
school
laws
of
this
commonwealth
on
the
part
of
the
professional
employee.
now
--
then
make
some
exceptions
for
retirement
and
the
closing
of
school
districts.
the
succeeding
section
is
the
one
that
i
just
referred
to,
that
provides
this.
in
determining
whether
a
professional
employee
shall
be
dismissed
for
incompetency,
the
professional
employee
shall
be
rated
by
an
approved
rating
system
which
shall
give
due
consideration
to
personality,
preparation
technique,
and
pupil
reaction
in
accordance
with
standards
and
regulations
for
such
scoring
as
defined
by
rating
cards
to
be
prepared
by
the
department
of
public
instruction
and
to
be
revised
from
time
to
time
by
that
department
in
cooperation
with
other
agencies.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
no,
sir.
the
court
of
common
pleas
went
a
bit
further
from
that
and
they
just
give
you
the
--
what
i
regard
as
the
gist
of
its
opinion
as
this.
the
procedure
pursued
by
the
school
authorities
was
patently
erroneous
and
the
grounds
upon
which
the
dismissal
was
based
are
not
supported
by
the
record.
the
school
authorities
obviously
desired
to
dismiss
appellant
because
they
suspected
him
of
disloyalty.
if
the
loyalty
act
been
followed,
appellant
would
have
been
afforded
the
safeguards,
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
safeguards
afforded
by
the
provisions
of
that
statute.
the
tenure
act
was
utilized
as
an
expedient
shortcut.
to
this
unauthorized
procedure,
we
dare
not
give
our
judicial
sanction.
we
should
be
ever
mindful
of
the
sage
observation
of
the
supreme
court
of
our
land,
“the
history
of
liberty
has
largely
been
the
history
of
the
observance
of
procedural
safeguards
citing
mcnabb.”
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
your
honor,
that's
half
of
my
complaint.
i
do
agree
with
it.
they
should
have
followed
the
loyalty
act.
but
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
mr.
rhoads
has
conceded
previously
and
i
assume
still
will
that
the
reason
he
didn't
was
because
he
didn't
have
any
evidence
against
this
man
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
under
the
loyalty
act.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
and
in
addition
to
that,
our
loyalty
act
reads
in
the
present
tense
in
order
to
dismiss
and
they
have
to
find
that
as
of
1953,
he
was
a
subversive
person
as
thereupon
and
the
most
recent
association
that
anybody
has
heard
of
in
this
case
was
that
in
1947.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
well,
no
sir,
it
would
simply
leave
us
in
this
position.
i'm
delighted
to
go
through
a
proceeding
under
the
loyalty
act
with
poor
knowledge
that
we
would
win.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
the
door
maybe
shut
to
inquiry
your
honor
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
do
reject
it
because
what
i'm
talking
about
under
the
loyalty
act
is
letting
them
bring
in
evidence
aliunde
to
its
questions.
let
them
bring
in
affirmative
proof
of
some
subversive
act
or
association.
i
say
that
under
no
circumstances
may
they
take
as
proof
either
of
disloyalty
or
incompetency
is
mere
silence
on
the
question.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
the
only
question
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
the
superintendent
asked.
now,
there
were
several
other
questions
asked
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
by
the
house
committee.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
it
is
at
least
in
the
present
state
in
the
then
state
of
the
pennsylvania
law.
now,
had
the
situation
existed
that
did
in
garner,
we
have
a
specific
disclosure
statute,
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
your
honors'
decision
in
garner
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
would
apply.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
it
is
outlawed
under
the
musmanno
act
of
1951.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
december
1951,
it
was
outlawed,
therefore,
these
proceedings
having
taken
place
in
1952
and
1953,
it
was
there
now.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
must
say,
i
think
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
think
the
pennsylvania
law
that
outlaws
it
is
unconstitutional.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
no,
sir.
neither
with
respect
to
the
time
when
superintendent
asked
him
about
1944
or
with
respect
to
the
times
asked
him
before
the
congressional
committee,
the
latest
of
which
was
1947,
where
at
least
four
years
after
that,
the
communist
party
was
lawfully
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
1951.
i
believe
it's
the
act
of
december
22nd,
1951.
well,
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
i
exhausted
my
time
but
i'd
like
to
--
since
i
have
five
minutes,
sum
it
up.
the
second
contention
that
we
made
on
the
procedural
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
well,
i
think
that
the
clerk
just
gave
me
the
five-minute
light,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
10
minutes,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
in
any
event,
our
principal
contention
on
procedural
due
process
is
that
you
cannot
fire
a
public
school
teacher
on
the
ground
of
incompetency
without
any
hearing
on
incompetency
and
without
any
evidence
of
it.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
purpose
was
as
stated
in
the
charges
which
your
honor
will
see
beginning
at
page
6
of
the
record
could
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
refused
to
answer
dr.
hoyer's
question
and
refused
on
the
ground
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
answer
the
committee's
questions.
now
the
conclusion
would
be
drawn
whether
they
sought
to
drew
--
draw
was
incompetency.
but
naturally,
if
you're
talking
about
the
--
the
competency
of
the
school
teacher
and
you
build
into
the
charges
of
limitation
upon
relevant
evidence
to
wit,
did
you
refuse
to
answer
this
question?
that's
the
limit
of
the
hearing.
i'd
say
that's
not
a
hearing
on
incompetency
at
all
in
any
rational
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
he
was,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
no,
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
he
did
not
nor
did
he
refused
to.
the
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
the
situation
occurred
at
the
--
your
honor
will
see
it
toward
about
page
64
of
the
record.
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
one
of
the
members
of
the
board
expressed
the
desire
to
question
mr.
beilan.i
made
no
objection
nor
did
he.
but
another
member
of
the
board
objected
and
that
board
member's
objection
was
sustained
by
the
board.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
it
would
have
been
irrelevant
to
the
charges
we
were
then
proceeding
on
your
honor.
you
see,
the
charges
were
very
specific
that
on
the
14th
of
october
he
refused
to
answer.
that
on
--
the
16th
or
18th
of
november,
1953,
he
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment.
those
were
the
only
issues
in
that
hearing.
the
--
the
rules
of
relevancy
would
dictate
that
further
inquiry
outside
of
the
scope
of
those
narrow
charges
would
have
been
improper.
indeed,
in
other
cases
the
board
so
ruled,
although
not
consistent
(inaudible)
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right,
under
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
oh,
you're
now
talking
about
my
contention,
sir?
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
right.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
thank
you.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
think
so.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that
--
you're
now
speaking
of
a
private
institution.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
do,
sir.
because
of
the
terms
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
in
terms
to
public
agencies,
state
agencies,
and
not
to
private
schools.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
it
would
not
be
as
clearly
unconstitutional
as
for
a
public
school
system
to
do
it
as
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
your
honor
has
told
us
so
many
times.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
it
must,
sir.
[laughter]
to
be
apparent,
in
answer
to
your
question
that
at
least,
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
at
which
the
real
issue
whether
they
chose
loyalty
or
competency
was
fully
heard.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
no,
sir.
i
said
they
made
a
fabricated
issue
that
this
teacher's
competency
was
unquestionable.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
they
--
they
present
the
whole
issue,
your
honor,
but
(voice
overlap)
in
the
result.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
what
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
these
two
matters,
two
refusals
that
were
relevant
in
those
charges.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
think
your
honor
that
he
can.
well,
this
is
personally
a
matter
of
pennsylvania
law
and
not
with
(inaudible)
of
your
honors.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
if
the
field
of
the
inquiry
is
into
disloyalty
and
there
is
a
specific
and
exclusive
law
relating
to
loyalty
then
i
think
the
inquiry
must
be
on
that
issue.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
then
you'd
get
an
added
opportunity
to
declare
it
on
the
incompetency.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
is
their
holding,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
--
on
the
challenge.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
the
hearing
your
honor
in
such
a
case,
i
believe,
would
go
into
the
matters
prescribed
by
section
1123
of
the
statute
which
i've
read
a
while
ago
rather
than
be
limited
to
that.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
your
honors
can
do
with
it
just
as
you
did
to
the
moral
character
requirement
under
the
california
bar
in
the
konigsberg
case.
there
are
some
constitutional
limits
upon
the
state's
right
to
redefine
the
english
language.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
just
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
in
konigsberg,
it
is
no
rational
evidence
of
incompetency
or
bad
moral
character.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
--
that's
one
of
them.
that's
one
in
my
brief,
what
i
have
been
discussing
here
is
rather
point
three.
it
is
more
in
procedural
due
process.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
if
your
honors
please.
since
it
has
been
mentioned,
i
perhaps
should
elucidate
a
little
bit
on
that
question
of
the
availability
of
records
of
what
happened.
there
are
pending
in
the
courts
of
common
pleas
of
philadelphia
right
now
25
cases
similar
to
this.
in
all
of
them,
there
are
records
of
proceedings
before
the
board
of
education
in
which
dr.
hoyer
testified
as
to
the
gist
of
his
interviews
with
the
teachers,
so
that
those
things
are
matters
of
record
on
the
appeal.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
right,
sir.
and
those
transcripts
are
now
in
the
courts
of
common
pleas
of
philadelphia.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
would
think
so
your
honor.
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
such
cases
that
teachers
who
fully
and
frankly
and
supinely
confessed
everything
that
mr.
hoyer
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
did,
sir.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
because
i
think
that
what
they
want
from
these
teachers
is
the
demonstration
of
an
attitude
of
complacent
agreement
with
everything
the
board
wants
whether
if
the
inquiry
is
about
--
has
loyalty
or
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
--
about
the
republican
party.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
true
sir.
but
may
i
say
also
that
there
are
cases
which
are
among
those
pending
in
the
courts
in
philadelphia
in
which
teachers
did
answer
dr.
hoyer
and
were
nevertheless
fired
simply
because
they
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment.
in
one
case,
a
woman
whose
case
is
now
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
district,
plead
the
first
amendment
and
was
nevertheless
fired
for
pleading
the
fifth.
there
is
no
consistency
among
those
decisions.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
right.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
that's
right.
and
there
are
such
cases
pending.
there
are
also
among
such
cases,
cases
in
which
teachers
in
their
hearings
before
the
board
offered
to
testify
in
answer
to
any
question
similar
to
those
that
they
had
previously
refused
to
answer
when
asked
by
the
superintendent.
they
too
were
fired.
and
those
cases
are
now
pending
before
the
court.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
[laughs]
otherwise
your
honors
would
be
certain
to
be
troubled
with
more
petitions.
i
should
like
to
answer
the
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
to
mr.
rhoads
and
suggested,
i
might
answer
it.
i
understand
that
courteously
it
is
that
of
a
superintendent
or
someone
in
authority
in
a
school
system
who
having
heard
rumors
about
a
school
being
infested
with
communist
--
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
right.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
and
i
take
it,
for
that
purpose,
he
makes
inquiries
similar
to
those
made
here.
i
say
sir,
that
that
only
changes
his
motivation
and
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
his
question
invades
their
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
rogers
carroll
i
think
sir,
that
your
case
presents
perhaps
a
little
more
evidence
of
pertinency
to
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
than
this
one.
but
in
any
event,
i
should
add
that
this
record
shows,
i
specifically
asked
dr.
hoyer
if
he
had
any
complaints
about
things
like
that,
his
answer
was
no.
now,
the
chief
justice's
questions
and
those
of
mr.
justice
--
justice
brennan,
i
think
have
indicated
that
the
definition
of
incompetency
which
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
adopted
in
this
case
is
just
so
broad
as
to
encompass
almost
the
whole
world
but
whatever
it
does,
the
distinction
in
mr.
rhoads
answer
between
the
communist
party
and
the
republican
party
indicates
that
in
considering
refusals
to
answer,
the
board
makes
the
intermediate
inference
through
loyalty
in
order
to
arrive
at
incompetency.
i
think
that
that
is
inescapable
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
in
mr.
rhoads'
answers
to
your
honors'
questions.
now,
on
the
procedural
due
process
question,
i
have
previously
argued
that
because
the
interest
wasn't
loyalty,
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
loyalty.
i
go
one
step
further
that
whatever
the
interest
was,
this
teacher
having
been
fired
for
refusing
to
answer
questions
about
loyalty
was
thereby
branded
with
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
called
a
stigma
of
disloyalty.
i
think
that
the
firing
under
a
stigma
of
disloyalty
is
as
clear
here
as
it
was
in
the
wieman
case
where
he
was
fired
for
refusing
to
answer
and
in
slochower.
that
i
say,
requires
a
hearing
on
loyalty.
thanks
very
kindly
your
honor.
