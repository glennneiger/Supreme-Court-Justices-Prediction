justice
john
m.

did
the
committee
(inaudible)
about
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
as
part
of
the
factual
matrix
your
honor
because
it
is
part
of
my
contention
that
had
the
committee
not
come
that
13-month
period
might
have
been
indefinitely
extended
and
would
never
have
happened.
this
man
might
not
have
been
dismissed
but
for
that.
now
it
is
of
course
perfectly
true
that
in
this
case
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
expressly
refused
to
decide
whether
the
refusal
to
answer
before
the
committee
could
be
independently
a
ground
for
dismissal.
that
arose
in
this
fashion.
we
had
argued
the
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
while
the
slochower
case
was
pending
in
this
court.
subsequently,
your
honors
decided
the
slochower
case.
then
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
on
its
own
motion
ordered
reargument
on
the
constitutional
questions
and
its
order
specifically
so
stated.
at
the
slochower,
realizing
that
your
honors
had
held
in
slochower
that
a
plea
of
the
fifth
amendment
before
a
committee
was
insufficient
for
firing.
the
supreme
court
didn't
decide
that
that
was
insufficient
but
expressly
says
in
its
opinion,
“we
decline
to
decide
it.
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
decide
it.”
but
factually,
that
is
what
happened.
petitioner
appeared
before
the
committee.
he
was
questioned
about
the
same
type
of
affiliation.
i
might
say
that
the
latest
affiliation
mentioned
in
any
of
the
questions
put
to
him
was
1947.
this
now,
mind
you,
is
1953.
in
any
event,
he
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment.
he
did
on
the
other
hand
submit
a
statement
to
the
committee
in
which
he
said
that
he
had
never
illegally
advocated
overthrow
of
the
government
and
he
also
said
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
talk
about
himself
if
the
committee
would
agree
not
to
ask
him
about
other
people.
and
congressman
walter
who
was
chairman
of
that
particular
subcommittee
had
declined
that
offer
so
we
don't
make
deals
with
witnesses.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
an
opportunity
in
that
the
petitioner
here
believes
that
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

right.

(inaudible)

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
the
state
authorities
as
i
understand
it
in
this
particular
case
is
that
some
others
are
coming
along,
there's
no
fifth
amendment
question
raised
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
way
i
understood
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
dispute
mr.
carroll's
statement
that
the
thing
that
sparked
this
eventual
proceeding
before
the
board
of
education
was
the
un-american
activities
committee
activity?
