herman
a.
beilan,
petitioner,
versus
board
school
district
of
philadelphia.
mr.
carroll,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carroll
--
mr.
carroll,
was
there
anything
in
the
pennsylvanian
laws
about
the
independence
of
teachers
so
far
as
their
political
views
were
concerned
and
--
and
the
right
of
people
to
interrogate
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
saw
a
subject
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
1944,
the
date
to
which
this
question
related,
were
communist
on
the
ballot
and
were
they
authorized
to
register
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
and
act
as
other
voters
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
have
not
exhausted
your
time.
you
have
45
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no.
no,
i
think
--
but
he
is
warning
you,
you
probably
told
him
how
much
time
you
want
for
rebuttal,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
--
well
that's
different.[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rhoads.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
had
asked
him
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
republican
central
committee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now
in
--
in
1944,
the
date
to
which
this
question
was
directed,
did
the
republican
--
did
the
man
have
any
--
any
less
right
to
be
a
communist
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
than
he
had
to
be
a
republican?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
have
any
less
right
in
1944
to
participate
in
public
elections
from
a
communist
standpoint
as
they
did
to
a
republican?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
let's
get
away
from
the
area
like
--
like
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
justice
frankfurter
had
been
taking
about.
did
he
have
any
less
right
to
--
did
he
have
any
less
right
in
1944
to
register
as
a
communist,
to
vote
as
a
communist,
to
have
--
to
engage
in
political
activity
as
a
communist
than
he
did
to
register,
vote
and,
engage
in
republican
problems?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
then
why
--
why
do
you
make
the
distinction
by
saying
that
it
would
have
been
improper
for
the
superintendent
to
have
asked
him
if
he
had
been
engaged
in
republican
politics
in
1944?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
we
get
to
that,
we
had
--
we
had
a
case
recently
where
the
authorities
considered
the
progressive
party
as
suspect,
and
they
--
they
endeavored
to
interrogate
a
man
about
his
activities
in
the
progressive
party.
now
suppose
that
they
had
asked
this
man
about
some
activities
in
the
progressive
party,
would
you
have
distinguished
that
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
right.
it
doesn't
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
charge
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rhoads,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
assume
--
assume
that
the
petitioner
had
answered
that
question
of
the
superintendent
and
had
answered
it
in
the
affirmative
that
in
1944,
he
had
been
a
member
of
that
--
of
that
committee.
could
they
have
discharged
him
for
incompetency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
don't.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rhoads,
if
--
the
thing
that
i'm
trying
to
get
straightened
out
in
my
mind
is
this.
you
say
that
this
question
that
the
superintendent
asked
about
communist
affiliations
in
1944
when
it
was
legal
was
entirely
pertinent,
relevant,
and
--
and
appropriate.
you
say
on
the
other
hand
that
you
--
you
think
to
ask
if
he
was
a
republican,
at
that
same
time
would
not
have
been
pertinent
and
would
not
have
been
appropriate.
i
assume
that
you
put
the
democrats
in
the
same
rule.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
you
get
somewhere
in
between
when
you
say,
"well,
i'm
not
so
sure
if
it
was
the
progressive
party
that
you
asked
about.
it
might
or
it
might
not
have
been
--
been
proper."
now,
how
or
where
it
--
what
is
the
standard?
how
--
how
is
the
board
going
to
determine
which
party
affiliations
and
activities
it
can
inquire
of
a
teacher
about
and
which
party
affiliations
is
it
going
to
--
to
say
that
it
cannot
inquire
about,
bearing
in
mind
that
you
do
have
a
constitutional
section
which
--
which
says
that
no
political
test
of
any
kind
shall
be
given
other
--
other
than
the
oath
of
allegiance
which
they
--
which
they
take.
now,
where
is
the
dividing
line?
how
can
you
say
to
me
that
--
that
is
--
it
would
be
wrong
to
ask
him
about
being
a
republican?
it's
very
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
or
it
is
at
least
doubtful
whether
you
could
ask
him
about
the
progressive
party
and
totally
proper
to
ask
about
the
--
the
communist
party
which
at
that
time
was
equally
legal
with
all
the
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
--
that
was
statutory,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
the
--
that
the
superintendent
can
manufacture
the
reasons
of
his
own
that
way
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
independent
of
the
legislature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
legislature
in
california
had
done
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
has
the
municipal
government
of
los
angeles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
your
legislature
have
prescribed
the
method,
a
precise
method
for
testing
the
loyalty
of
school
teachers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
had
--
it
had
provided
that
there
were
certain
procedures
that
they
must
go
through
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
remove
a
school
teacher
for
disloyalty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
then
--
why
then
did
they
wait
all
of
that
time
from
or
the
time
you
gave
them
the
opinion
that
it
constituted
incompetence
until
the
next
november
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continuing
--
continuing
to
give
him
a
satisfactory
report
each
month
on
--
on
compentency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carroll.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
fifth,
they
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
congressional
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
the
philadelphia
court
fired
them
for
that
alone?
