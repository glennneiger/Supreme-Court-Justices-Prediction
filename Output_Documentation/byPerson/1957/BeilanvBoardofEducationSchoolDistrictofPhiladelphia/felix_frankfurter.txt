justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carroll,
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
as
to
the
relevance
of
the
committee
hearing
who
said
that
it
--
that
what
permeated,
what
took
place,
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
but
you
do
not
suggest
that
he
was
dismissed
because
of
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
--
can
one
really
quarrel
with
mr.
justice
jones
that
at
best,
you
can't
tell
on
what
ground
they
went?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
is
the
consequence?
assume
you
--
assume
the
court
would
agree
with
dissent,
what
is
the
disposition
they
may
hear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
he
suggests
that
you
go
back
to
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
devolve
that
ambiguity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
whatever
they
trust.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
they
may
find
necessary
for
them
to
decide
and
not
for
us
unless
they
do
not
decide
something
that's
constitutionally
been
raised.
that's
the
moment.
i'm
just
directing
my
thought
to
the
position
of
justice
jones
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
that
the
thing
is
left
in
a
confused
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
but
what
we
will
or
will
do,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
slochower
wasn't
this,
is
slochower
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
they
pulled
that
out
and
say
that
isn't
why
we're
dismissing
it
since
slochower
wouldn't
be
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
isn't
whether
jointly
disqualify
them,
the
question
is
what
inquiry
may
a
board
of
education
or
any
agency
of
it
relevant
remain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
could
not
yet
reach
the
question
even
on
the
assumption
that
it's
restricted
to
refusal
to
answer
to
the
board.
unless
you
have
that
question
alone,
then
you
have
to
reach
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
they
dismissed
him
because
of
that.
then
you
have
a
question
that
is,
as
i
take
it,
not
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
mixing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
here,
you're
mixing
up
two
things.
does
it
mean
that
--
that
school
teachers
or
persons
in
--
or
teachers
in
a
college,
does
it
mean
that
inquiring
into
the
fitness
of
a
person
in
a
teaching
institution
must
have
been
advanced
--
must
have
had
advanced
notice
years
before
if
such
a
question
might
be
asked
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you're
contending
for
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
the
relevance
of
saying
in
garner
they
knew
eight
years
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
ask
people
in
an
educational
institutions
about
their
activity
not
because
their
activities
are
bad.
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
were
asked
them,
professor
(inaudible)
weren't
all
questions
that
made
answer
of
yes
a
disqualification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
totally
different
thing.
it's
like
asking
a
lawyer
questions
bearing
on
its
fitness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
talking
about
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
very
definite
thing
of
questions.
i
was
thinking
--
i
was
taliing
about
me
having
been
questioned
what
i
thought
has
happened.
from
my
point
of
view,
that's
nobody's
business
except
the
authority
there,
assume
i
didn't
have
like
opinions.
i
think
you're
mixing
up
things.
you
talked
about
the
--
the
illegality
of
congress
and
inquiring
into
what
may
or
may
not
be
relevant
to
the
continuing
activity
of
a
person,
of
a
teacher.
those
are
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
well
be
that
a
school
authority
or
a
university
authority
can
ask
the
person
the
most
innocent
question
in
the
world
in
order
to
find
out
whether
for
one
reason
or
they
should
lie
about
it.
we
don't
want
to
have
a
liar
around
the
premises.
justice

frankfurter
(voice

every
thing
in
the
first
amendment
area
--
i
don't
know
what
first
amendment
area
means.
i
know
that
the
first
amendment
is
but
the
constitution
doesn't
talk
about
areas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
ask
him
whether
he's
member
of
the
klan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not.
all
right.
yet
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yet
new
york
had
this
--
this
court
held
that
new
york
conferred
a
statute
dealing
with
membership
in
the
klan?
justice

well,
but
if
it's
within
the
first
amendment
area
that
no
statute
can
save
it
as
you
call
it,
the
first
amendment
area.
justice
felix

i
don't
want
--
i
simply
don't
want
us
to
stop
thinking
by
using
the
abracadabra
first
amendment
area.
justice

well,
don't

--
justice

well,
a
--
could
the
question
be
asked
today
except
on
the
assumption
that
the
dennis
case
is
not
to
be
respected
or
other
cases
of
this
court?
they
must
be
overruled
first
before
that
question
can
be
asked?
justice
felix

no.
today.
justice
felix

i'm
saying
today.(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
a
teacher
today
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
be
asked
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
they're
not
punishing
to
me.
is
it
necessarily
punished
if
a
man
for
one
reason
or
another,
assuming
it
is
an
invalid
reason
is
asked
questions
pertaining
to
his
fitness
to
be
a

that
punishment
on
any
sense
that
as
in
legal
meaning
of
punishment?
justice
felix

all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under

under
pennsylvania
law
did
the
tenure
which
he
had
--
the
tenure
that
could
not
be
changed
by
your
legislature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
can
--
does
that
--
is
that
the
act,
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't,
is
that
the
act
under
which
the
procedure
for
termination
of
the
tenure
is
defined?
justice

would
you
mind
stating
again
what
that
procedural
requirement
is?
justice

--
and
they
had
to
follow
that
procedure
was
the
ground
was
(inaudible)
of
your
strong
court
of
common
pleas.
justice
felix

you
don't
agree
with
them
of
what
--
what
the
court
said
about
the
loyalty
act,
of
course.
justice
felix

you
do
not
agree
what
they
say
about
following
the
procedure
of
your
loyalty
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
they
couldn't
possibly
have
with
--
under
the
loyalty
act
in
the
state
of
--
political
state
of
the
communist
party
of
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
say
i
didn't
think
you'd
--
you'd
have
to
reject
what
the
court
of
common
pleas
said
about
the
loyalty
act,
that
that
was
the
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
if
--
in
your
answer
to
one
of
my
questions
that
the
door
is
shut
to
such
an
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
even
suggest
that
i
agree
with
the
court
of
common
pleas,
i
don't
know
enough
but
i
--
i
felt
it
was
clear
that
you
would
have
to
reject
that
suggestion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
nothing
else
in
this
record
except
the
suggestion
that
he
once
was
affiliated
with
the
then
form
of
a
communist
party,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
had
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
your
point
of
view,
that's
a
bad
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carroll,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
which
to
me
is
extremely
important.
when
asked
of
the
argument
that
the
determination
--
termination
of
a
tenure
of
a
teacher
on
the
score
of
incompetency
requires
an
opportunity
for
him
to
be
heard,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
under
pennsylvania
law
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
matter
of
due
process.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question
because
if
you're
right
of
the
very
serious
proposition
that's
in
this
court.
speaking
of
the
institution
about
which
--
the
only
institution
about
which
i
really
know
the
procedure,
all
those
schools
they've
had
time
out
of
mind,
a
thing
called
a
visiting
committee
of
eminent
lawyers
and
judges.
so
that
it's
a
class
ruling.
now,
suppose
such
a
visiting
committee
turned
in
a
report
first
to
the
faculty
and
--
and
or
to
the
two
governing
bodies
of
that
institution.
and
both
governing
bodies
are
convinced
of
the
validity
of
the
conclusion
reached
by
three
pursuits
as
they
often
they
are
eminent
judges.
there's
a
particular
teacher
who
is
quite
incompetent.
i
can
assure
you
that
can
happen.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
he
is
this
on
the
basis
of
that
finding
adopted
by
the
governing
authorities
in
the
school
dismissed.
but
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
whether
he
has
any
other
remedy
except
to
go
to
the
american
association
of
university
professors
and
say
that
in
fact
he
was
dismissed
for
some
sinister
inquiry.
can
he
come
to
the
court
and
say,
"i
had
a
right
to
have
a
hearing,
i
have
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer,
at
least
i
have
a
right
to
make
a
speech
for
myself."
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i've
got
to
ask
you,
do
you
think
that
--
that's
different
as
to
--
as
between
a
private
and
a
public
institution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
--
suppose
after
all
the
--
a
public
college
is
found
to
be
operating
under
this
statute
of
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
where
you'd
have
a
statute
which
authorizes
of
it.
will
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
always
find
it
difficult
to
know
when
a
thing
is
clearly
unconstitutional
or
cloudily
unconstitutional.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
he
leave
no
impression.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
are
the
beneficiary
of
that
remark,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
or
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhoads
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
put
to
you
a
question
of
--
i
hope,
perhaps
mr.
carroll
would
also
find
time
to
deal
with
(inaudible).
suppose
your
superintendent
of
schools
had
opened
these
proceedings
with
district
or
any
teacher,
with
this
by
statement
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
widespread,
though
wholly
false
and
unfounded
belief
in
the
neighborhood,
whence
this
school
draws
its
inference,
that
the
school
is
communist
really,
that
nine-tenths
of
the
teachers
are
members
or
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
i
have
the
best
of
reasons
for
knowing
that
that
isn't
true
and
this
is
superintendent
speaking.
but
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
disprove
that
which
is
damaging
to
the
conduct
of
a
school
system
as
effectively
as
i
can
by
the
testimony
of
the
teachers.
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
ask
you
a
question,
with
that
background
and
for
that
reason,
and
for
that
--
and
in
view,
would
your
case
--
would
you
think
your
case
was
different?
that
mr.
carroll
said,
this
case
is
different
if
in
such
stated
circumstances,
the
inquiry
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it
be
more
so
if
one
employs
into
moral
lesson
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
been
found
to
be
a
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
fact
that
there
would
be
in
the
mind
of
the
superintendent
of
the
schools
with
all
the
difficulties
that
all
of
us
who
knows,
the
superintendent
have
in
a
--
it's
community,
in
giving
his
reasons
with
the
propelling
considerations
rather
than
certainly
in
his
mind
that
the
peaceful
conduct
with
the
school
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
--
whether
that
case
(inaudible)
as
it
was
described
mr.
carroll
then,
he
said
that,
(inaudible)

therefore

taken

mr.

the
tenor

ultimately

mr.

may
i
ask
you
this
question.
are
there
as
a
matter
of
record,
i
don't
mean
in
this
record,
but
as
a
matter
of
record,
a
proceeding
before
your
board
of
education
whether
they
have
or
have
not
come
into
court,
it's
--
where
similar
--
where
questions
of
a
nature
such
as
were
put
to
the
petition,
were
in
fact
and
by
teaching,
and
words
that
--
and
answered
in
the
affirmative
whether
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party
when
they
asked
them,
and
dismissal
followed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
basis
(inaudible)
are
there
situations
where
they
did
--
did
ask?
justice

admitted
in
answer.
admitted
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
denied,
of
course
it's
been
denied
then
there's
no
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
all
in
the
past?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
instances
matters
of
educational
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
just
in
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean,
are
they
--
are
they
--are
there
documents
pertaining
to
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you,
as
counsel
of
the
board,
telling
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
that
is
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
an
annual
report
of
the
board
of
education?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
that
report,
would
there
be
references
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
inquiries
into
alleged
incompetent
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhoads,
i
don't
put
a
(inaudible)
of
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
whole
confidence
in
your
statement,
it's
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
understand
it,
the
25
cases
in
which
questions
like
these
were
put
and
teachers
refused
to
answer
and
they
were
dismissed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
as
to
the
five
or
six
which
mr.
rhoads
referred,
they
--
i
suppose
though,
from
my
point
of
view,
i'd
imagine
in
the
right
mind,
the
school
board
wouldn't
make
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
finding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
it
just
means
that
you
cannot
very
well
search
the
concept
of
those
who
did
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
slochower
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
enumeration
cases
makes
it
even
clearer
to
mean
that
we
better
decide
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
didn't
say
rumors.
i'm
giving
a
real
practical
concern
of
some
knowledge
in
this
matter
with
school
authorities
who
were
worried
about
by
hearing
a
sufficient
number
of
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
