mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
mr.
chief
justice,
and
with
respectful
submission
to
your
honors.
the
issue
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case
is
threefold
and
it
is
brief
whether
in
the
first
instance,
state
of
pennsylvania
has
the
constitutional
right
to
dismiss
a
public
school
teacher
for
refusal
to
answer
pertinent
questions
in
an
area
relating
to
past
communist
affiliations.
second,
whether
the
interpretation
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
that
such
a
refusal
to
answer
in
point
of
fact
constitutes
incompetency
under
the
school
code
of
pennsylvania
is
in
fact
an
interpretation
of
a
state
statute
and
does
not
involve
constitutional
questions,
and
thirdly
wether
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
was
in
any
degree
an
absence
of
due
process.
now
our
position,
submission
to
your
honors
is
from
start
to
finish
that
the
issue
here
was,
one,
primarily
of
local
law
that
in
the
first
instance
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
the
school
teacher
and
for
the
moment
i'm
not
going
to
debate
very
much
the
issues
of
fact
which
have
been
discussed
by
my
friend.
but
the
question
whether
the
inquiry
which
was
initiated
in
a
professional
interview
by
the
superintendent
of
schools
in
philadelphia
was
a
proper
inquiry.
in
other
words
here
in
1952,
he
brings
in
a
school
teacher
for
a
professional
interview
and
he
asks
him
certain
questions
regarding
prior
communist
affiliations.
the
school
teacher
says
in
substance,
“i
don't
know
whether
i'll
answer
those
questions
but
you
read
them
to
me.”
and
the
first
question
that
was
read
and
others
of
course
were
to
be
propounded
was
whether
in
1944
he
had
been
press
director
of
a
communist
political
association
to
which
he
answered
as
mr.
carroll
said,
“i'll
have
to
seek
advise
of
counsel.”
later
on,
seven
months
later
in
october,
he
came
again,
in
the
same
spur
of
the
professional
interview
and
said,
“i
have
been
advised
by
counsel
that
you
have
no
right
to
ask
that
question.”
this
is
important
if
your
honors
please,
bearing
on
the
one
question
asked
that
question
or
any
similar
question.
consequently,
the
superintendent
stopped
at
the
threshold.
and
in
that
moment,
he
specifically
warned
that
teacher
beilan
that
he
was
inquiring.
the
reason
for
his
inquiry
was
the
professional
fitness,
i.e.
the
adequacy,
the
competency
of
this
particular
person
and
that
is
adhered
the
superintendent
was
the
reason
i'm
asking
these
questions.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
the
republican
central
committee,
i
would
have
thought
sir
that
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
sir
with
the
fitness
or
the
competency
of
a
teacher
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
completely
different
area
when
you
were
dealing
here
with
the
sensitive
area
as
your
honors
have
said
of
the
public
school
system
where
the
question
of
communist
affiliations
is
an
important
matter.
it
isn't
simply
a
matter
of
asking
what
is
a
person's
political
or
religious
belief?
it
is
asking
a
matter
that
has
--
goes
to
the
very
integrity
as
i
view
it
if
your
honors
please,
of
the
school
system.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
think,
sir,
that
the
answer
to
that
question
lies
again
in
the
area
of
the
interrogation,
the
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
think
he
would
have
had
the
same
rights,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
and
register
as
a
republican
or
as
a
communist
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
--
equally
they
were
appropriately
proper.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
for
this
--
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
to
that,
sir,
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
no
matter
how
we
cut
the
cable,
the
situation
is
different
with
reference
to
a
--
an
interrogation
by
a
school
superintendent
regarding
what
has
been
conceived
to
be
a
suspect
organization
even
though
legal,
if
your
honors
please,
as
distinct
from
what
we
recognized
as
a
straight
political
association.
in
other
words,
as
we
come
to
garner
and
in
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
advert
to
garner.
the
situation
in
garner
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
think
in
sweezy,
you
could
possibly
have
distinguished
it
--
distinguished
this
case.
i
would
think
that
the
progressive
party
might
possibly
have
approached
more
nearly
the
area
--
i'm
sorry,
the
situation.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
(voice
overlap)
--
[laughter]
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
approach
more
nearly
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
thank
you
sir.
well,
coming
to
you,
i
should
like
to
have
been
the
beneficiary.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
i
simply
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
i
--
i
simply
possibly
should
not
so
readily
concede
it,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
it
--
yes,
sir.
in
--
in
this
particular
job,
i
--
i
should
think
that
there
would
be
a
far
closer
trespass
upon
something
which
we
would
call
under
garner
a
non-pertinent
inquiry.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
whatever
you
deal
and
particularly
with
an
area
from
1941
on
up
to
1951
or
thereabouts
with
the
communist
political
association
which
i
think
we
all
recognized
as
the
wartime
guise
if
you
will,
of
the
communist
party,
but
that
doesn't
affect
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
that
nevertheless
when
you're
dealing
with
that
type
of
examination,
you're
dealing
with
an
urgency
irrelative
to
the
school
system
which
doesn't
quite
apply,
mr.
justice
harlan,
where
we're
dealing
with
what
i
would
call
a
straight
open
function
board
question
regarding
sonic
relationships
or
republican
or
democratic
parties
and
so
forth.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
is
the
extent
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
far
from
it.
my
feeling
is
that
the
supreme
court's
decision
on
the
facts
of
this
case
said
that
the
particular
inquiry
which
had
to
do
with
past
associations
in
the
communist
party
was
in
any
event
extremely
pertinent.
but
i
would
certainly
think,
sir,
that
the
supreme
court's
decision
as
we
know
it,
as
we
read
it
here
would
be
that
the
refusal
to
answer
any
pertinent
question
would
constitute
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
the
question
in
my
mind,
mr.
justice
brennan
is
whether
we
would
interpret
that
as
pertinent.
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
were
just
discussing
it
a
moment
ago.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
i
would
certainly
be
inclined
to
think
sir,
that
the
school
district
in
philadelphia
would
never
have
sanctioned
any
such
type
of
inquiry.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
i
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
then
or
now,
sir.
and
--
[laughter]
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
my
interpretation
of
the
extent
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
is
that
it
is
incompetency
for
a
teacher
under
the
act
of
1949
in
pennsylvania
to
refuse
to
answer
what
judicially
could
properly
be
determined
to
be
a
pertinent
question
bearing
upon
his
fitness.
then
sir,
coming
down
to
your
specific
question
whether
the
republican
central
committee
would
be
such
a
question,
it
would
seem
to
me
would
be
a
matter
for
judicial
determination.
i
am
inclined
to
think
sir,
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
judicially
would
have
determined
the
question
not
pertinent
and
would
not
have
held
as
it
did
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
think
not
--
not
only
colored
by
the
fact,
it
was
definitely
influenced
by
the
facts
sir,
just
as
if
the
question,
and
i
raised
it
in
my
brief,
just
as
if
the
same
question
and
similar
inquiry
had
been
directed
toward
the
teacher's
morality
if
the
question
had
been
an
inquiry
regarding
dope
peddling
which
has
been
raised
by
the
supreme
court
in
its
decision
and
there
had
been
a
refusal
to
answer.
i
think
with
the
same
force,
i
would
have
argued
that
the
question
in
the
matter
of
dope
peddling
was
material
and
pertinent,
and
a
refusal
to
answer
would
have
constituted
incompetency.
we
have
had
several
cases
in
pennsylvania
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
the
horosko
case,
the
bethlehem
city
case,
and
numerous
others
in
which
the
term
incompetency
has
been
defined
by
the
supreme
court
in
its
broad
reach
of
the
term
as
was
said
in
this
particular
decision.
we
had
for
example
in
the
bethlehem
city
case,
the
facts
regarding
a
teacher
who
was
found
to
have
been
throwing
dice,
for
example.
in
another
case,
there
was
a
physical
in
--
disability
caused
by
improvident
conduct
in
the
part
of
a
school
teacher
and
it
was
said
to
be
incompetency.
so
that
the
idea
that
you
can't
equate
incompetency
with
any
number
of
pertinent
inquiries
would
hardly
stand
up
in
our
school
code
and
i
think
this
is
an
equation
with
one
of
those
pertinent
inquiries.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no
sir.
and
i
have
so
argued
and
so
stated
in
my
brief
and
so
stated
to
your
honors.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
what
would
be
the
answer
to
the
particular
inquiry
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
of
competency
or
incompetency
or
the
right
to
ask
it,
that
very
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
decided.
as
i
understand
the
situation,
in
garner
where
the
question
of
the
affidavit
--
i
beg
your
padon.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
where
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
affidavit
arose
and
your
honors
will
recall
there.
the
question
was
a
broad
affidavit
question,
“were
you
ever
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
the
communist
political
association?"
which
even
at
that
time
was
a
lawful
organization
and
in
insisting
that
the
affidavit
requirement
was
right.
this
court
said
that
it
was
pertinent.
the
mere
fact
that
it
had
to
do
with
past
associations
is
indifferent
but
coming
specifically
to
your
honors'
question,
you
said
sir,
that
not
before
us
is
the
question
whether
the
city
may
determine
that
an
employee's
disclosure
of
such
political
affiliation
justifies
his
discharge.
and
my
answer
sir,
is,
that
we
have
never
taken
and
do
not
now
take
the
position
that
upon
the
answers
to
specific
questions
would
depend
the
right
to
dismiss.
our
contention
throughout
this
proceeding
is
that
in
the
area
of
the
public
school
system
in
the
matter
of
the
protection
of
its
integrity,
this
type
of
inquiry
is
proper.
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
public
school
teacher
by
virtue
of
the
peculiar
relationship
existing
between
a
public
employer
and
a
public
employee
to
answer
pertinent
questions.
and
that
you
cannot,
by
virtue
of
your
refusal
to
partake
or
join
in
such
an
inquiry
thwart
what
has
been
conceived
to
be
by
this
court
and
courts
throughout
the
nation
to
be
a
proper
inquiry
that
you
can't
work
that
type
of
inquiry
and
then
say
that
you
are
competent.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
the
inquiry
in
the
case
supposed
by
you
would
be
equally
pertinent,
equally
proper.
i
take
it
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
more
so.
the
fact
to
the
matter
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
there
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
i
think
sir,
that
when
your
honors
study
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
dr.
hoyer
did,
it
seems
to
me
sir,
give
full
opportunity
to
this
particular
teacher
to
know
that
there
was
a
type
of
inquiry
going
on.
he
said,
i
have
questions
right
at
the
start.
we
don't
deny
that
he's
questioning
said
loyalty.
he
said
we
have
certain
unimpeachable
evidence
to
the
effect
that
--
that
would
affect
your
loyalty,
your
fitness
to
be
a
member
of
the
public
school
system.
he
gave
the
teacher
full
opportunity
to
know
what
was
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
being
made.
now,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
now,
specifically
the
first
answer
to
that
question,
sir,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
rely
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
garner.
in
garner,
your
honors
say
that
as
to
the
same
political
association,
it's
legal.
your
honors
said
that
it
is
a
perfectly
proper
and
pertinent
inquiry
to
go
back
not
to
1944,
one
question,
but
were
you
ever?
this
was
in
1951
when
the
affidavit
was
asked
for,
were
you
ever
a
member
of
a
communist
party
or
the
communist
political
association?
garner
says
that
this
inquiry
was
correct.
but,
in
order
to
more
specifically
answer
your
honor
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
oh,
it
was
statutory
but
--
but
it
seems
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no,
sir.
i
do
not
and
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
don't
think
that
the
superintendent
or
the
board
can
manufacture.
but
the
superintendent
can
if
it
is
an
appropriate
inquiry,
initiate
the
inquiry.
the
board
can
follow
up
the
inquiry
and
if
it
believes
that
those
facts
add
up
to
incompetency,
it
may
charge
incompetency.
it
is
then
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
sovereign
state
of
pennsylvania
to
determine
judicially
whether
there
had
been
an
improper
or
an
impertinent
question
or
whether
the
question
was
pertinent
and
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
school
superintendent
to
ask.
that's
as
far
as
--
as
we
can
go.
and
it's
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
oh,
if
in
the
question
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
if
your
honor
pleases,
there
are
many
situations
involving
past
associations
which
may
seem
to
smack
if
you
will,
of
disloyalty
and
in
which
nevertheless
the
evidence
if
you
will,
would
not
add
up
to
disloyalty.
we
haven't
suggested
in
this
case
disloyalty.
we
don't
know
what
might
have
been
the
case
mr.
chief
justice,
if
this
inquiry
had
not
been
thwarted
at
the
threshold.
if
for
example,
question
after
question
had
been
asked
and
answered
which
would
have
led
up
an
equated
ultimately
something
which
the
school
board
would
say,
"adds
up
to
disloyalty,
we
would
then
of
course
have
had
to
proceed
and
we've
said
it
all
along
under
the
patriot
act
and
charge
this
man
with
disloyalty."
but
the
supreme
court
has
said
in
this
case
that
we
were
not
charging
disloyalty.
we
did
not
charge
disloyalty.
we
were
merely
asking
proper
questions
which
were
not
answered
and
therefore
an
area
of
inquiry
proper
within
the
concept
of
the
integrity
of
the
public
schools
was
thwarted.
now,
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
said
in
this
case,
constituted
incompetency.
and
if
it
said
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
represents
the
final
decision
of
a
state
supreme
court.
for
example,
just
to
--
to
show
how
this
adds
up
in
the
mind
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
121
of
my
record
if
your
honors
please,
where
the
court
is
commenting
upon
the
misguided,
secretiveness,
and
lack
of
candor
of
this
teacher
as
referred
to
by
the
common
pleas
court.
then,
says
the
majority
opinion
on
page
121,
the
secretiveness
and
i'm
quoting,
"of
a
deliberate,
the
secretiveness,
consisted
of
a
deliberate
and
insubordinate
refusal
to
answer
questions
of
his
administrative
superior
in
a
vitally
important
matter
pertaining
to
his
fitness."
such
conduct
stamped
him
with
incompetence
as
a
professional
employee
of
the
public
schools.
now,
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
your
honors
please,
i
can't
go,
the
supreme
court
said,
"you
had
a
duty
under
the
act
of
1949,
our
school
code,
you
had
an
obligation.
you
didn't
have
to
be
warned.
you
didn't
have
to
have
a
regulation.
you
didn't
have
to
have
an
ordinance
such
as
garner.
you
had
a
school
code
which
defines
the
basis
upon
which
tenure
could
be
severed.
and
when
you
didn't
cooperate
in
this
case
by
answering
the
first
question
which
we
hold
to
be
pertinent,
you
have
put
us
in
a
position
where
we
have
no
alternative
other
than
to
find
you
incompetent.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
not
at
all.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
that's
precisely
mr.
justice
whittaker
what
the
courts
have
said
time
and
again
that
the
reason
for
these
questions
and
it
was
what
was
said
in
garner.
the
pertinency
of
the
question
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
may
have
been
an
innocent
member
of
the
communist
party
or
you
may
have
been
a
knowing
member
of
the
communist
party.
but
whatever
the
circumstances,
we,
the
school
district
are
entitled
to
know
whether
you
ever
were,
whether
it's
communist
political
association
or
communist
party
when
at
any
time
that
membership
ceased
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
did
cease.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
possibly
not,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
possibly
not.
i
have
felt
the
low
to
break
into
if
you
will
what
i
considered
--
conceived
to
be
a
little
different
situation
and
i've
tried
to
answer
the
chief
justice.
it's
--
it
is
difficult
but
coming
to
the
pertinency,
i
still
suggest
to
your
honor,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
there
might
be
some
difference
but
that
it
would
be
a
matter
for
judicial
determination.
now
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes,
sir.
and
all
of
these
teachers,
mr.
justice
black,
are
under
what
is
known
as
tenure
by
the
act
of
1949,
and
that
tenure
can
be
terminated
only
by
proper
dismissal
proceedings
brought
under
the
act
under
the
grounds
of
incompetency,
persistent
and
willful,
immoral
intent,
and
persistent
negligence,
and
so
forth.
there's
specific
causes
and
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
it's
a
permanent
contract,
sir.
and
as
has
been
held
many
times
and
has
been
held
in
this
case
tenure
is
an
insulation
to
the
teacher
against
the
variabilities
of
political
sword
if
you,
will
but
never
was
it
intended
to
be
an
insulation
against
fitness
and
therefore
as
in
this
case,
we
felt
that
what
had
happened
here,
we
--
it
was
that
this
teacher
found
himself
in
the
position
of
refusing
to
undertake
with
us
a
proper
inquiry.
now,
can
that
man
be
fit
under
the
terms
of
our
law
or
the
proper
definition
of
it?
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
was
he
discharged,
sir?
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
must
confess
that
i
think
i
have
not,
sir.
i
don't
--
we
have
not
cited
it
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
black.
we
felt
that
the
--
the
controlling
situation
was
garner
and
adler
and
that
those
cases
were
unaffected
by
konigsberg
or
slochower
for
reasons
that
seemed
to
us
obvious
and
we
have
set
them
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
oh,
if
you're
asking
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
if
you're
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
am
not
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
am
not
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
--
i
would
not
--
if
your
honor
asked
me
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
to
mr.
carroll,
i'm
afraid
that
i
could
not
have
concurred.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
the
contract
as
we
admit
we
have
here
and
where
you
have
a
legislative
basis
for
changing
the
tenure,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
violative
of
the
contract
if
as
to
an
existing
contract,
you
then
put
in
other
reasons.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
oh,
yes
sir.
this
man
was
under
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
(inaudible)
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
that
--
that
would
have
been
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
is
--
will
be
presented
to
your
honors
here.we
believe
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
oh,
yes.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
but,
to
answer
mr.
justice
black
on
that
particular
situation,
i
think
that
in
this
case,
you
will
find
that
our
contention
and
we
believe
it
is
sound,
is
that
we
have
employed
the
proper
ground
for
termination
under
the
act
giving
tenure
so
that
we
are
not
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
it
--
it
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
it
--
it
might
very
well
be
sir.
i
have
contended
sir,
that
under
the
barsky
case,
that
the
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court
here
is
controlling
on
your
honors'
decision.
but
nonetheless,
it
is
clearly
a
question
that
is
raised
before
your
honors
because
obviously
there's
just
been
a
--
under
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
a
sham.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
why
--
i
--
i
am
sure
that
i
would
not
be
here
and
the
school
district
wouldn't
be
arguing
this
case
at
the
present
for
as
the
moment.
may
i
plead
guilty
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
to
something
that
i
hate
to
admit
in
an
appellate
argument
but
there
is
a
case
which
i
would
like
to
--
to
which
i
would
like
your
--
to
refer
your
honors.
it
is
the
case
of
--
and
it
is
not
on
my
brief,
it
is
the
case
of
davis
against
the
university
of
kansas
city
decided
on
april
15,
1955
by
the
now
mr.
justice
whittaker
who
was
then
a
member
of
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
and
it
is
129
f.supp.,
page
716.
and
i
would
not
like
to
go
into
too
much
detail
with
reference
to
that
case
because
it
isn't
on
my
brief,
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
very
significant
because
on
the
facts
it
comes
closer
to
the
type
of
proceeding
that
we
find
in
this
case,
that
has
any
case
which
i
have
discovered.
and
i
only
--
i'm
only
happy
with
one
thing
in
this
confession
and
that
is
that
apparently
none
of
my
friends
have
made
a
similar
discovery.
but
in
the
davis
case
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i'm
sure,
sir.
in
the
davis
case,
the
school
teacher
who
was
a
professor
in
the
university
of
kansas
city
was
called
before
the
general
committee,
he
pled
the
fifth
amendment
and
thereafter
the
authorities
of
the
school
--
of
the
university,
first
an
educational
committee
similar
to
the
one
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
suggesting
and
later
on
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
asked
mr.
davis
to
come
in
before
them
and
they
propounded
three
certain
questions
that
are
referred
to
in
the
decision.
they
all
had
to
do
with
membership
in
the
communist
party,
membership
in
communist
activities
or
support
of
communist
organizations.
he
refused
to
answer
his
immediate
superiors
and
later
on
was
discharged.
there
was
tenure
in
that
case
by
contract.
he
was
later
on
discharged.
and
when
the
matter
came
up
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
reinstatement,
the
question
was
squarely
presented
and
the
court
in
that
case
said
and
i
would
just
like
to
quote
briefly
that
the
public
will
not
stand
and
they
ought
not
to
stand
for
such
reticence
or
refusals
to
answer
by
the
teachers
in
their
schools.
and
the
university
officials
would
have
been
derelict
in
their
duties
had
they
not
asked
the
plaintiff
in
the
light
of
his
refusal
to
answer
the
senate
subcommittee's
questions
as
to
whether
he
was
a
communist,
whether
he
was
or
ever
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
having
asked
him
those
questions
that
he
have
been
refused
to
answer
them
would
have
been
derelict
in
their
duties
and
would
have
destroyed
the
university
had
they
not
dismissed
him.
now,
the
significance
of
that
case
to
me
if
your
honors
please
is
that
in
view
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
slochower
where
garner
was
still
referred
to
when
your
honors
said
it
doesn't
follow
that
in
a
proper
inquiry,
dr.
slochower
may
not
prove
himself
to
be
not
in
the
proper
service
of
the
state.
now
here,
what
happened
was
that
the
man
was
brought
back
before
a
proper
committee,
an
informal
committee
of
this
university
and
there
it
was
held
that
they
have
the
right
to
ask
the
questions
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
answer
and
his
failure
to
answer
would
justify
the
dismissal.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
there's
no
fifth
amendment
question
raised
here,
so
that
we
believe
is
completely
out
of
face
by
the
decisions
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
that
is
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
(inaudible)
discharged
in
that
case
sir,
and
incompetency
was
equated
to
the
failure
to
discharge
under
a
decision
by
our
court
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
first
question,
may
i
reply
very
briefly,
sir?
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
some
misapprehension
sir,
on
your
honors'
part
about
what
happened
here
as
to
whether
beilan
was
asked
the
question
before
the
board.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
beilan
was
not
asked
that
question
before
the
board.
the
superintendent,
we're
dealing
now
with
due
process,
i
take
it.
the
superintendent
called
him
in
twice
on
a
professional
inquiry.
it
was
then
that
the
refusal
took
place.
then
sir,
under
the
code,
the
charges
were
filed,
formal
charges,
charge
of
incompetence
by
reason
of
his
refusal
to
answer.
the
evidence
in
the
hearing
before
the
board
was
mr.
hoyer
--
mr.
hoyer,
the
superintendent,
stepping
up
in
the
witness
stand
and
say,
this
was
what
happened.
"i
called
him
in.
he
didn't
answer."
that
was
the
testimony
before
the
school
board.
mr.
carroll
was
there
representing
mr.
beilan.
mr.
beilan
was
present.
he
had
an
opportunity
to
testify.
he
didn't
testify.
it
wasn't
our
job
before
this
--
before
the
board
of
public
education,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
we
then
have
charges
before
us
and
those
charges
were
based
upon
the
refusal
to
answer
the
superintendent,
beilan
was
there,
he
didn't
take
the
stand,
he
didn't
explain
anything
other
than
what
was
already
in
the
record.
but
there
were
formal
charges,
every
single
step,
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
was
provided
under
the
code
as
to
hearing,
counsel.
he
was
even
given
a
private
hearing
of
his
own
request
under
the
code,
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
they're
appeals
and
so
forth.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
not
dispute
the
fact
that
that
sparked
it.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
think
he
used
that
expression.
i
would
dispute
not
only
what
the
court
below
said
but
what
mr.
carroll
has
frequently
said
that
this
was
a
subterfuge
incompetency.
the
fact
to
the
matter
as
long
as
we're
going
somewhat
out
of
the
record,
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
i,
as
counsel
for
the
school
board,
as
early
as
january
of
1953,
some
six,
seven,
or
eight
months
before
the
advent
of
the
congressional
committee
was
asked
for
my
opinion,
not
only
on
this
case
but
on
as
mr.
carroll
said,
other
cases
which
had
taken
a
great
leave
of
time
to
process.
and
as
early
as
march
1,
i
think
it
was
then
or
in
that
area,
i
rendered
an
opinion
to
my
client
to
the
effect
that
the
failure
to
answer
the
superintendent's
question
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
they
haven't
changed,
constituted
incompetence.
so
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
school
board,
there
was
no
afterthought,
there
was
no
subterfuge.
i
must
answer
mr.
justice
harlan
frankly
and
intellectually
your
honors,
when
the
(inaudible)
committee
did
come
to
philadelphia,
one
might
use
the
vernacular
that
the
matter,
the
--
the
fact
was
in
the
fire,
the
time
was
there
and
it
is
true.
so
i
do
not
dispute
the
statement
as
such
but
i
did
think
your
honor
should
know
that
this
was
not
an
act
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
oh,
no.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
think
sir,
i
can
answer
that
only
by
the
very
practical
knowledge
that
all
of
your
honors
have
in
matters
pertaining
to
public
bodies.
that
opinion
was
rendered
and
i
think
your
honors
can
well
understand
in
a
matter
of
that
--
in
a
matter
of
this
gravity
which
involved
tremendous
questions
of
policy,
that
question
was
not
settled
promptly.
the
summer
came
along
and
it
was
in
the
harper,
may
i
say
within
weeks
at
the
time
that
the
congressional
committee
came.
the
time
if
your
honor
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
time
between
the
first
interview
with
the
superintendent
and
the
final
bringing
of
charges
which
was
some
13
months
was
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
we
had
some
as
mr.
carroll
has
said,
some
32
of
these
cases
in
which
we
felt
that
we
wanted
to
keep
everything
as
quiet
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
teachers
and
everyone
else
as
possible
and
the
processing
of
those
case
as
your
honors
could
well
understand
was
a
matter
of
considerable
physical
as
well
as
time
effort.
now,
i
believe
if
your
honors
please,
that
i
have
taken
my
time
and
the
question
of
due
process
which
has
been
raised,
i
think
i
have
covered
here.
the
question
of
the
lack
of
statutory
authority,
i
believe,
is
completely
out
of
this
case
because
we
are
urging
here
that
what
happened
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
was
nothing
more
than
the
judicial
process
with
which
we're
thoroughly
familiar
that
of
a
state
court
interpreting
general
language
in
its
own
acts
and
that's
what
happened
here.
so
far
as
the
disloyalty
situation
is
concerned
with
which
we
have
been
hounded
from
the
start
of
this
case,
i
only
ask
your
honors,
rather
than
have
me
read
any
sections,
to
read
carefully
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
says
which
is,
"in
words
of
one
so
that
this
is
not
a
loyalty
proceeding.
disloyalty
wasn't
charged
and
therefore
to
pick
an
act,
the
loyalty
act
was
not
employed."
and
then
i
respectfully
go
from
there
sir,
and
say
that
that
decision
was
a
decision
from
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
determining
which
of
two
of
its
--
let
us
say,
possibly
alternative
acts
should
apply
and
it
said,
no
uncertain
language
that
we're
not
dealing
with
disloyalty,
we
didn't
charge
disloyalty,
and
i
will
ask
your
honors
to
read
carefully
the
notation
on
the
footnote
of
the
record
in
my
brief
where
i
refer
to
what
mr.
carroll
said
when
he
agreed
with
me
in
the
hearings
before
the
board
that
this
is
not
a
loyalty
proceeding
and
i
don't
intend
to
have
it
made
such.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
there
were.
there
were
some
six
or
seven
cases
sir.
and
i
very
much
regret
it
that
i
had
to
call
mr.
carroll's
attention
to
what
i
think
was
an
inadvertent
misstatement
when
he
said
that
there
were
those
who
had
been
fired,
who
had
answered
questions.
that
is
an
error.
there
are
some
six
i
believe,
or
five,
i've
forgotten
which
who
have
specifically
answered
the
superintendent's
questions.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no,
sir.
i
--
i
cannot
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
well,
the
--
no.
i
--
there
was
no
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
i
know
of
in
which
there
was
a
--
an
admitted
membership
presently
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
there
were
in
the
past
and
in
those
cases
sir
when
the
superintendent
satisfied
himself
of
the
genuine
good
faith
of
the
teacher
in
response
to
that
professional
inquiry,
i
say
categorically
sir,
those
teachers
are
still
on
our
payroll
and
they
are
still
--
we
verily
believe
are
good
teachers.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
when
i
say
educational
record
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
no,
sir.
i
think
--
if
i
should
find
that
there
are
sir,
i
will
of
course
advise
your
honor.
but
my
recollection
is
that
they
were
entirely
in
the
nature
of
private
professional
interviews
and
therefore
did
not
at
any
time
arise
to
the
dignity
of
a
transcript
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
do,
sir.
and
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
they
happened
at
or
about
the
same
time
mr.
justice
black
when
all
of
these
--
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
in
1953,
1952
and
1953.
they
were
part
of
the
group
of
--
what
i
have
just
defined
as
some
32
school
teachers.
and
i
so
state
sir,
and
i
am
--
i
had
not
--
i
did
not
have
to
do
with
those
particular
cases
but
the
administrative
office
of
the
school
district
has
advised
me
that
that
is
the
fact.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
to
those?
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
i
--
i
think
sir,
vthat
until
these
cases
reach
the
formal
hearing
stage
and
charges,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
as
your
honor
has
interrogated.
in
other
words,
i
know
there
is
nothing
about
merely
the
inquiry.
mr.
c.
brewster
rhoads
oh,
thank
you
so
much.
