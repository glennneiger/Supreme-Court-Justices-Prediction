justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
carroll,
don't
--
do
--
don't
i
or
do
i
correctly
read
the
majority
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
is
holding
that
the
refusal
to
answer
the
superintendent's
question
of
itself
in
standing
alone
is
incompetency
within
the
meaning
of
the
pennsylvania
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
if
that
is
their
holding,
what
in
the
way
of
a
hearing
on
that
question
as
i
understand
there
is
an
admission
that
the
question
was
not
answered,
isn't
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
fact,
what
purpose
would
a
hearing
serve?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
how
can
we
reach
that
conclusion
if
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
held,
as
you
concede
it
has
that
the
refusal
to
answer
however
much
i
might
disagree
with
that
reasoning,
if
that
is
the
holding
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
what
can
we
do
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that
of
the
--
the
conclusion
that
the
mere
refusal
to
answer
was
incompetency
is
so
irrational
a
conclusion
as
that
it's
a
denial
of
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
that
sense,
the
denial
of
due
process,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
is
that
--
is
that
the
argument
you're
making
to
us
or
that's
just
one
of
your
arguments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
mr.
rhoads
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
does
that
mean
that
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
held
was
not
that
any
refusal
to
answer
a
question
is
incompetency
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
but
only
a
refusal
to
answer
a
question
directed
to
previous
communist
affiliation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
--
even
that
would
regard
to
membership
on
a
republican
committee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
--
well,
what
i
--
i
know
mine's
a
little
different,
the
approach
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is,
would
in
your
view
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
rule
as
laid
down
in
this
case
have
justified
a
finding
of
incompetency
if
the
question
had
been,
"were
you
a
member
of
the
republican
central
committee
in
1944?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
might
--
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
your
view
of
the
scope
of
the
holding
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
on
the
definition
of
incompetence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
does
that
(inaudible)
of
the
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
(inaudible)
if
the
question
sought
an
answer
related
to
previous
communist
(inaudible)
