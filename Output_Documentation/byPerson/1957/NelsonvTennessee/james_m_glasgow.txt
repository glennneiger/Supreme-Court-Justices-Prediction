mr.
james
m.
glasgow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
i
can
clarify
this
rather
briefly
as
to
what
situation
here
is
in
regard
to
the
record.
on
page
--
under
the
tennessee
procedure,
it
was
necessary
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
for
the
petitioners
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
setting
forward
the
various
grounds
of
error
in
the
trial
court.
after
that,
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
perfect
their
appeal
by
filing
assignments
of
error
and
a
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
now,
both
of
those
instruments
or
documents
are
in
this
record.
on
page
13
is
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
12
and
13
--
pages
12
and
13
of
the
record.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
now,
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
only
thing
that
i
can
find
under
roman
numeral
one,
subsections
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
with
reference
to
the
jury
question
is
in
reference
to
the
state
constitution,
article
1,
section
6
of
the
constitution.
now,
otherwise,
this
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
completely
devoid
of
any
substantial
federal
question
except
in
regard
to
the
confessions
which
are
not
before
this
court,
because
on
the
writ
for
certiorari,
we
were
limited
to
the
jury
question.
now,
on
page
30
of
the
printed
record,
in
the
assignments
of
error,
brief
and
argued.
i
beg
your
pardon,
page
29
and
then
continuing
over
on
page
30,
31,
32,
and
33.
there
is
nothing
in
regard
to
a
substantial
federal
question.
no
reference
is
made
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
whole
argument
is
pitched
upon
the
constitution
of
tennessee.
now
further
in
the
same
record
on
page
55,
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
it
is
said
in
the
fourth
paragraph,
the
defendant
have
--
defendants
have
filed
several
assignments
of
error
but
they
have
argued
only
two
propositions
as
a
ground
for
reversal.
the
one
was
the
confession.
the
other
was
the
jury
of
proposition.
the
jury
proposition
is
resolved
in
the
later
part
of
the
opinion
by
reference
to
four
tennessee
cases.
each
of
those
tennessee
cases
you
will
find,
deal
only
with
a
construction
of
the
constitution
of
tennessee,
and
therefore,
it
is
necessary
to
look
behind
the
opinion
to
see
actually
what
the
grounds
were
upon
which
the
state
court
reached
its
decision.
and
we
submit,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it's
improper
not
only
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
them
to
raise
this
question
here
for
the
first
time
but
also
that
it's
unfair
to
the
state
courts
that
it'd
be
treated
in
that
way.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
this
in
regard
to
my
position
in
the
case.
i
did
not
argue
this
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
that
was
done
by
the
then
acting
advocate
general
of
the
state
whose
name
appears
upon
brief
in
reply
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
took
this
record
just
as
you
have
it
and
worked
on
this
case
from
that
point.
and
from
what
i
have
found,
i
cannot
find
anything
which
partakes
or
even
smacks
of
the
federal
question.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
going
back
to
the
jurisdictional
question
for
one
observation
only,
i
should
like
to
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
these
petitioners
wanted
to
protect
their
rights
by
raising
federal
questions
in
the
state
courts
they
might
well
have
done
so
by
filing
a
petition
to
rehear
which
under
the
rules
of
the
court
maybe
filed
within
15
days
after
the
opinion
is
announced
in
any
decision.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
otherwise
we're
on
the
same
grounds
when
we
say
that
a
substantial
federal
question
has
not
been
raised
that
certainly
we
don't
want
to
weigh
that
by
going
forward
with
these
other
questions.
but
i
do
want
to
address
the
court
very
briefly
if
i
may
on
those
subjects.
senator
atkins
is
always
very
persuasive
and
he
raises
the
very
interesting
proposition
of
discrimination
as
between
the
various
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
he
says
that
--
first
of
all
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
our
court
held
that
it
was
reversible
error
for
a
trial
court
to
do
what
was
done
in
this
case.
now,
our
court
distinguished
that
proposition
by
saying
that
that
error
was
coupled
with
other
errors
which
required
a
reversal
in
the
case
and
although
they
said
it
was
error
to
do
what
was
done
in
this
instance
that
it
would
not
be
sufficient
when
standing
alone
to
require
a
reversal.
now,
i
submit
that
that's
purely
a
question
of
the
state
law
that
has
been
resolved
by
the
state
courts
and
certainly
it's
not
a
thing
that
this
court
would
look
into.
now,
there
are
two
propositions
on
which
we
say
that
this
court
should
dismiss
the
writ
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
state
court
opinion
rest
upon
an
adequate
and
independent
non-federal
ground,
and
that
is
that
these
petitioners,
under
the
tennessee
constitution
received
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
by
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
and
our
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
that
satisfies
the
constitutional
requirement
in
our
state.
now,
i
take
it
that
under
the
adjudicated
cases,
come
into
this
court
or
coming
from
this
court,
that
there
could
be
no
question
whatever
about
the
construction
which
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
places
upon
its
own
constitution.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
i
--
it
will
review
all
the
facts.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
yes,
sir,
and
the
rule
is
or
the
rule
of
evidence
is
this
or
in
regard
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
that
the
weight
of
the
evidence
must
preponderate
against
the
verdict
and
in
favor
of
the
innocence
of
the
accused
before
the
court
will
reverse
upon
the
facts.
but
now
the
factual
situation
was
resolved
aside
and
apart
from
these
legal
questions
which
were
raised
which
were
in
regard
to
the
confession
and
in
regard
to
the
jury
question.
and
we
take
it
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
factual
situation
that
there
is
no
serious
dispute
as
to
the
facts
because
counsel,
as
i
understand
it,
representing
the
petitioners,
conceives
that
the
facts
were
cited
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
are
accurate
in
its
opinion.
now,
the
other
proposition,
it
seems
to
me,
that
might
be
raised
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
by
saying
that
the
error
that
occurred
in
the
trial
court
was
cured
by
its
harmless
error
of
the
statute,
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
it
has
been
argued
that
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment
and
others.
and
certainly
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
under
that
sixth
amendment,
all
that
is
raised
there
or
protected
there
are
federal
rights
and
not
state
rights.
and
it
is
also
saying
that
in
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
that
the
fourteenth
used
the
same
protection
that
is
supported
under
the
fifth.
therefore,
i
take
it
that
the
only
possible
question
which
could
be
raised
would
be
in
regard
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
this
court
has
had
before
it
the
problem
of
construing
statutes
in
regard
to
various
classes
of
people
from
jury
service
in
the
states.
it's
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
can
be
a
structure
and
a
regular
jury
system
coexisting
in
the
same
state
where
an
unequal
number
of
challenges
are
involved.
it
is
has
had
the
blue
ribbon
jury
case
before
it
from
the
state
of
new
york,
and
then
all
of
those
cases
this
court
has
concluded
that
so
long
that
as
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
is
afforded
and
accused
by
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
that
that
is
all
that
is
necessary.
that
substantially
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
held
was
required
under
the
constitution
of
tennessee.
therefore,
we
submit
that
under
those
cases
that
which
are
mostly
akin
and
by
analogy
are
very
similar
to
the
proposition
which
we
have
here
that
they
--
that
control
the
question
at
bar.
we
respectfully
submit,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
case
--
that
writ
should
be
dismissed
and
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
yes?
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
it
is
created
by
a
statute.
under
our
statute
of
course
the
attorney
general
is
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
the
statute
then
provides
for
two
advocate
generals,
one
solicitor
general
and
three
field
attorneys.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
i
can't
answer
that.
his
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
the
handling
of
criminal
cases
primarily.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
since
the
--
about
30
years,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
that
depends
upon
how
the
civil
case
gets
to
the
court
may
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
some
cases
they
do.
now,
we
have
a
court
of
appeals
which
is
an
intermediate
court
in
tennessee.
if
there
is
a
concurrent
finding
of
fact
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
is
foreclosed.
i'm
looking
into
the
facts.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
meaning
of
those
facts
or
what
the
facts
actually
were,
the
court
will
look
into.
and
we
get
some
very
difficult
situations
as
a
result.
