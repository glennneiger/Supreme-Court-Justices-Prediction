justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
the
question
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
constitutional
right?
i
don't
mean
to
tennessee
state
constitution
but
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
nonequality
here
consisted
in
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
what
your
supreme
court
said
that
they
discriminate
it
consciously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
said
that
in
order
to
find
discrimination,
there
must
be
a
systematic
exclusion
of
a
class
that
obviously
is
entitled
out
of
which
obviously
are
to
be
drawn
jurors.
now,
was
that
out
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
because
some
union
problems
are
involved
in
the
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
but
there
was
a
trial
--
the
trial
judge
said
that
in
as
much
--
i'm
not
now
suggesting
that
he
was
right
or
wrong.
i'm
not
even
suggesting
that
he
wasn't
wrong
(inaudible)
the
trial
judge
said
that
in
as
much
as
two
men
who
were
members
of
the
union
were
on
trial,
a
natural
sympathy
of
other
union
members
with
such
person,
constituted
the
challenge
or
cost.
is
that
what
he
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
the
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
say,
i
don't
want
to
have
any
union
members
in
my
courtroom.
he
said
in
this
trial
considering
the
nature
of
the
defendant
to
the
issues
involved
and
the
motion
that
would
be
aroused,
no
union
member
is
--
is
--
every
union
member
presumptively
to
(inaudible)
now,
the
question
is
whether
that
is
obviously
a
systematic
exclusion
for
the
sake
of
exclusion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unrelated
to
any
--
what
might
be
called
rational
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
we
have
no
legals
on
the
jury
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
this
judge
exclude
members
of
the
union
in
every
case
that
comes
before
him?
did
he
excluded
in
the
case
immediately
before
this
one
and
the
need
to
be
following
this
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
just
made
a
rule
that
--
with
reference
to
the
issues
in
this
case
that
he
thought
the
--
the
appealing
is
too
close
and
connected
to
make
him
wholly
a
disinterested
juror.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
rather
he
might
have
thought
that
no
matter
how
hard
he
tries,
he's
naturally
advised
in
favor
of
his
fellow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
i'm
not
now
saying
that
he
was
justified
in
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
exactly
what
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
tried
the
case
before
the
judge
who
has
to
tried
that
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
are
you
suggesting
that
it
always
exclude
labor
union
men?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
scope
of
review
on
the
fact
by
your
supreme
court,
mr.
attorney
general
in
criminal
cases,
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
glasgow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
if
i
may
ask
you
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
whether
the
office
of
advocate
general
is
something
very
peculiar
to
tennessee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
title,
is
that
prevail
in
other
states
for
that
function?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
there
no
title
(inaudible)
