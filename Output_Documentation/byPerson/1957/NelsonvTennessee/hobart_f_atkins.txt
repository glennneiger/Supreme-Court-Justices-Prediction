mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
we
did.

in
the

mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
now
that
is
in
connection
with
the
jury.
there
were
two
--
may
i
interpose?
there
were
two
assignments
of
error
that
had
to
do
with
the
constitutional
guarantee.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
the
first
one
is
section
a.
because
of
the
removal
and
discharge
for
cause
from
the
jury
path,
violates
the
letter
and
spirit
of
article
1,
section
6
of
the
constitution.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
the
constitution
of
tennessee
that
we
now
have
was
adapted
in
1807
and
it
is
the
same
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
insofar
as
the
rights
of
a
defendant
or
rights
of
a
citizen
to
a
jury
trial
or
concern.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
it
--
it
doesn't
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
the
other
--
in
the
--
in
the
third
assignment
on
page
13.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
says
--
the
--
in
speaking
of
the
violation
of
the
rights,
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
due
process
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
the
third
assignment.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
in
speaking
of
the
statement,
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendments.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well,
it
was
so
treated
and
they
argued
it.
the
two
questions
were
--
were
presented
to
our
appellate
court
and
were
brought
here
as
both
having
to
do
with
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
defendants.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
but
having
--
having
submitted
the
two
questions
as
being
matters
that
pertain
to
their
constitutional
rights
then
would
not
to
this
court
under
its
rules
to
have
a
right
to
--
to
grant
it
on
the
other
assignment,
to
the
exclusion
of
this
assignment
having
jurisdiction
conferred
by
reason
of
the
matter
originating
in
the
trial
court
and
on
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
accepting
in
--
in
this
situation.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes,
but
i
think
i
have.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well,
the
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
and
then
i
filed
a
petition
with
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
in
which
are
stated
in
the
petition.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
printed
in
the
record
but
it's
a
part
of
the
record.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
the
defendants
allowed
--
let
me
read
if
that
will
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
in
the
printed
record.
this
record
was
printed
for
four
persons
and
i
didn't
complete
--
have
all
of
the
record
printed,
only
that
part
which
directly
pertain
to
the
jury
question
or
included
in
the
printed
record
here.
now,
that
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that's
true
--
that's
true,
your
honor.
but,
there
comes
the
appellants
and
each
of
them
and
show
and
represent
to
this
court
that
they
were
petitioned
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
with
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
to
review
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
that
on
july
the
20th,
1956
wherein
the
verdict
of
the
jury
and
sentences
are
from
one
to
three
years
and
two
cases
to
run
consecutively
against
that.
the
said
review
being
based
upon
the
federal
question
that
they
are
denied
due
process
of
law
and
that
their
rights
does
violated
on
the
constitution
and
particularly
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
that
they
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
consult
counsel,
required
unwillingly
to
be
witnesses
against
themselves
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
because
they
were
members
of
labor
unions,
organizations,
they
were
denied
the
right
and
privilege
of
having
other
citizens
who
were
qualified
as
jurors
but
who
belonged
to
labor
organizations
from
participating
as
jurors
in
the
administration
of
justice.
a
discrimination
against
all
union
members,
inconsistent
with
and
in
violation
of
amendment
fourteenth
of
the
constitution,
they
being
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
by
reason
of
the
exclusion
of
our
members
of
labor
union.
the
said
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
will
be
immediately
filed
but
due
to
the
fact
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
state
is
now
or
soon
will
be
in
vacation
said
petition
were
probably
not
be
considered
until
the
court
convince
at
the
october
term
1956.
that
probable
conviction
in
the
trial
court
and
while
the
cost
is
spending
in
the
trial
court
the
appellants
were
allowed
to
pay
bail
in
the
sum
of
$1000.
and
that
they
and
each
of
them,
at
all
times,
had
perform
the
condition
of
bail
and
that
they
and
each
of
them
are
citizens
and
resident
of
knox
county,
tennessee
and
have
families
that
they
are
each
employed
outside
of
the
state
but
with
at
all
times
be
available
for
the
performance
of
the
condition
of
the
bail
and
will
immediately
upon
notification
return
to
the
state
or
permitted
to
go
back
to
the
state
of
ohio
where
they
are
in
fraud.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
i'm
reading
from
a
petition
filed
with
the
supreme
court
at
the
--
at
knoxville,
petitioning
that
court
who
suspend
this
judgment
until
it
could
be
reviewed
in
this
court
and
to
allow
these
men
bail
or
while
the
cost
was
pending.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
but,
if
your
honor
please,
the
question
was
presented.
it
was
argued
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
at
the
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well,
in
the
--
in
the
brief
that
the
state
filed.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
in
the
brief
that
the
state
filed,
in
the
brief
filed
in
this
court.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well
that
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
it
was
presented
in
this
way
that
the
state
has
rights
but
it
also
had
an
obligation
that
is
that
the
state
court
agreed
that
these
were
errors.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
the
two
errors
or
two
assignments
that
we
have
insisted
on
were
errors.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
they're
errors
under
both
cases.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
in
the
opinion
has
such
it
--
the
reason
why
it
was
error
is
not
given
but
the
reason
that
it
was
error
is
because
it
violated
their
rights.
in
the
--
in
the
published
opinion,
recorded
in
the
southwestern
report,
the
appellate
court
said
that
“the
fact
that
a
person
is
a
member
of
a
particular
order,
association
or
other
organization,
does
not
of
itself
render
such
person
incompetent
as
a
juror”.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
they
didn't
mention
either
constitution
or
either
section.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
they
--
they
decided
that
those
were
errors
but
didn't
say
why.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
they
didn't
give
the
basis
for
the
decision.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
if
your
honor
please,
we
--
the
assignments
of
error
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
argument
on
those
assignments,
the
two
assignments
that
is
the
assignment
pertaining
to
the
impaneling
of
the
jury
and
the
assignment
pertaining
to
the
--
the
obtaining
of
the
confession
were
presented
as
one
assignment
of
rights
that
were
violated.
and
in
the
--
in
the
brief
of
the
state
filed
in
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
state's
statement
of
fact
on
page
3,
this
has
been
the
position
of
the
state.
it
was
before
the
state
supreme
court.
the
question
raised
by
the
petition
is
first,
that
their
confessions
were
improperly
admitted
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
second,
that
the
trial
court
violated
the
same
amendment
when
it
sustained
challenges
for
cause
to
members
of
labor
unions
when
called
for
jury
service.
these
questions
will
be
discussed
in
this
order.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
now,
those
are
the
same
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
then
on
page,
if
your
honor
please,
on
pages
9.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
of
the
same
document
here.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
they
--
they
rely
on
this
court's
opinion
in
the
fay
versus
new
york,
332
u.s.
261.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
if
your
honors
please,
the
assignments
of
error
in
our
appellate
court
are
the
same
as
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
now,
under
c
on
the
first
assignment
of
error
of
our
jury
or
about
the
jurors,
i
said
this
--
now
this
is
prior
to
the
statement
in
the
third
article
where
i
spelled
out
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment.
because
the
only
means
on
speaking
at
the
under
c
provided
and
limited
to
each
side,
is
that
a
preempt
charge
which
is
intended
and
does
permit
the
exclusion
of
those
suspected
advice
or
prejudice.
these
rights
of
challenge
were
assured
at
common
law
as
procedural
instruments
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
traditional
rights
of
the
fair
and
impartial
jury.
there
is
no
doctrine
of
exclusion
other
than
that
setout
in
the
constitution
and
statute.
now,
the
constitution
--
there
is,
as
i
say,
our
constitution
of
1890
and
the
constitution,
the
national
constitution
are
comparable.
but
the
constitution
doesn't
say
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
the
constitution
in
the
statute.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
you
honor
that
would
be
a
useless
statement
to
--
to
go
ahead
say
the
constitution
and
then
say
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
state
constitution.
we
considered
these
two
questions
in
the
light
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state.
and
frankly,
i
think
our
appellate
court
agree
that
it
was
true
that
this
action
did
violate
the
constitutional
rights
and
for
the
first
time,
the
court
applied
to
these
constitutional
rights
the
harmless
error
of
statute.
and
of
course
the
first
time
we
had
in
the
--
that
we
could
object
to
it
was
when
i
filed
this
petition
that
i
was
intending
to
appeal
to
this
court
to
review
the
action
of
our
state
appellate
court.
that
is
the
first
emanation
that
we
have,
that
it
would
be
considered
a
harmless
error
to
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
defendants
and
that
is
the
substance
of
what
occurred.
we
thought
that
we
had
reserved
every
right
in
the
in
paneling
of
the
jury
that
we
exhausted
the
rights
of
these
defendants
to
preempt
toward
a
challenge.
we
objected
to
each
juror
being
excluded
and
there
were
27
excluded.
and
we
presented
the
matter
to
the
trial
judge
after
our
objections
were
overruled
in
the
trial.
and
in
the
--
in
the
brief
that
we
filed,
we
ask
that
these
constitutional
rights
be
enforced.
we
presented
it
as
forcefully
as
we
could.
there
has
not
been
a
holding
by
this
honorable
court
that
we
could
find
on
this
identical
proposition.
but
we
did
find
cases
where
this
court
had
said
that
those
states
have
rights
and
they
have
responsibilities
and
that
this
fourteenth
amendment
and
be
invoked
to
require
a
state
to
treat
all
citizens
equally.
and
we
have,
we
think
in
our
brief,
establish
that
this
is
the
only
case
that
our
supreme
court
has
ever
applied
to
a
constitutional
right,
this
harmless
error
statute.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
we
did
not.
our
state
court
didn't
hold
but
three
days
at
the
knoxville
time.
it
was
a
short
court
with
only
a
few
cases
and
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
ask
for
a
rehearing.
we
did
petition
for
a
bail
and
it
granted
bail
and
gave
us
still
proceedings
that
we
might
have
these
two
federal
question
reviewed.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
the
federal
constitutional
right
is
that
defendants
be
treated
equally.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
discrimination
against
all
members
of
organized
labor.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
is
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
--
that
is
what
our
--
the
trial
judge
said
that
any
men
--
any
member
of
organized
labor
of
any
union
would
be
discharged
for
a
cause
for
that
reason.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
because
two
members
of
a
local
union
were
to
be
tried
for
itself.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
the
union
will
add
such
that
was
not
involved.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
not
in
those
words,
he
may
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
may
have
been.
i
would
--
what
he
said
was
that
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
that
is
one
of
the
questions.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well
if
you
--
if
you're
classifying
negroes
as
such,
i
see
no
difference.
if
--
if
you
are
to
classify
all
union
men,
you
can
extend
it
to
classify
all
baptist
or
all
methodist
or
all
members
of
the
masonic
order
or
--
if
we
are
to
engage
in
classification
for
jury
purposes
or
for
purposes
of
neutral
responsibility
in
the
judicial
and
governmental
departments
then
we
could
extend
it
ad
infinitum.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
no,
sir.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well
he
would
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
well
each
--
each
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
i
wouldn't
agree
that
he
did
that.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
let
me
put
it
in
my
language
and
see
if
we
have
a
meeting
place.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
no,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
he
should
have
excluded
them
this
time.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
now
then
our
appellate
court
or
the
argument
in
our
appellate
court
was,
that
while
this
is
wrong,
it's
an
error
and
we
won't
do
it
anymore.
now
then
you
--
you've
come
to
this
proposition,
do
we
administer
law
to
those
two
defendants,
those
two
individuals
as
a
personal
proposition
or
are
they
here
equal
with
all
others
at
the
bar
of
justice.
if
they
are
equal,
they
should
have
an
equal
opportunity
in
the
selection
of
a
jury,
if
they
are
not,
then
they're
not
entitled
to
it.
now
basically
that
is
the
situation
with
reference
to
this
application
of
this
harmless
error
statute.
there
are
three
cases
that
our
supreme
court
has
decided
where
the
matter
of
print
challenges
or
allowing
too
many
challenges
to
the
state
or
in
law,
the
one
levine's
case
that
is
cited
that
was
argued
to
the
supreme
court.
and
in
this
opinion
you
notice
that
they
undertook
to
differentiate
and
say
that
that
was
a
colored
man.
there
--
there
were
two
other
cases
that
we
have
cited
and
in
both
of
those
cases,
one
juror,
one
challenge
by
the
state,
worthy
of
a
qualified
juror
more
than
what's
allowed
was
held
to
be
irreversible
error.so
this
is
the
only
case
which
the
--
on
this
error,
a
statute
has
been
applied.
i
think
that
i
have
another
minute
or
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.

now
then
--
this
was
the
argument
i
made
apart
of
the
argument
in
the
supreme
court.
we
have
a
number
of
cases
where
men
violate
both
the
rights
of
a
man
in
his
home
and
the
right
to
search
in
seizure.
if
you
say
that
because
these
men
were
guilty
in
your
opinion,
they
were
not
entitled
to
these
frauds
then
couldn't
you
as
reasonably
say
when
you
found
something
that's
a
violation
in
the
man's
home
that
--
it's
all
right
to
go
and
search
it
illegally.
mr.

atkins
i
--
i
--
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
if
he
had
--
if
he
had
cause
but
the
cause
was
insufficient.
that
cause
is
--
he's
not
allowed
for
cause
to
just
--
to
strike
discriminately.
the
cause
was
that
they
were
members
of
labor
union
which
is
not
a
sufficient
cause.
mr.
hobart
f.
atkins
may
it
please
your
--
gentlemen,
the
matter
of
rights
was
fully
discoursed
in
the
trial
before
the
supreme
court
of
our
state.
so
they
didn't
spell
it
out
in
the
opinion.
that
is
the
basis,
i
think,
without
fear
of
contradiction,
the
basis
on
which
they
say
in
the
opinion
reported
as
i
have
previously
indicated
that
it
was
an
error
that
the
court
erred
in
this
matter
of
excluding
these
27
jurors
because
they
were
members
of
labor
union,
but
that
--
the
harmless
error
statute
would
prevent
a
reversal.
i
think
that
is
the
factual
picture.
there
was
no
question
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
as
i
understood
it
but
what
it
was
an
erroneous
rule
and
it
was
error
to
have
excluded
these
men
for
no
other
reason.
they
were
competent
jurors
before
they
are
tendered,
their
bias,
prejudice
kinship,
or
ten
or
twelve
reasons.
those
were
disposed
of
before
the
jury
--
juror
is
tendered
for
jury
service.
then
after
he
is
tendered
as
a
qualified
juror,
that
is
when
this
withdrawal
took
place.
