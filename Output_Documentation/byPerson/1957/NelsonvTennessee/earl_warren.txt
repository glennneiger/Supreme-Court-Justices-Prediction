number
56,
gerald
william
nelson
and
john
e.
hatton,
petitioners
versus
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
atkins.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
atkins,
before
you
get
to
your
argument,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this
question,
whether
your
question
that
we
took
on
certiorari
was
ever
raised
in
the
court
below
in
any
of
the
courts
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
there
was
no
mentioned,
of
course,
about
it
not
being
raised.
there
was
nothing
said
in
the
response
but
in
petition
or
in
the
respondent's
brief,
the
very
first
item
in
its
argument
is
to
the
effect
that
this
court
is
without
jurisdiction
because
the
petitioners
did
not
raise
a
substantial
federal
question
on
the
jury
issue
in
the
state
courts
nor
have
they
allege
a
substantial
federal
question
in
this
court.
now,
did
you
raise
that
question
in
the
courts
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
was
it
first
raised?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
indicate
to
us
in
the
record
where
it
was
raised
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
12.
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
now
read
the
first
one
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
isn't
that
the
tennessee
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
you
raise
the
issue
of
--
under
a
state
section
or
article
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
have
the
federal
question
adequately
raised.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
page
13?
what
does
that
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
where
is
that?
where
do
i
find
that,
in
what
part
of
the
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
third
assignment,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now,
let's
see
what
--
let
me
see
that
third
specification.
does
that
go
to
the
jury
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you're
--
you're
saying
here,
mr.
atkins
the
honorable
trial
court
erred
in
admitting
the
statements
of
the
defendants
nelson,
hatton
and
craig
when
seasonably
objected
to
because
said
statements
were
largely
irrelevant
and
immaterial
and
were
conclusions
of
the
district
attorney
obtained
by
means
of
cross-examination,
oppression,
mental
cruelty
and
the
rest
and
obtained
in
violation
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
of
the
due
process
clause
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
--
and
fifth
amendments.
now,
we
denied
your
certiorari
on
that
question,
the
only
question
that
we
permitted
you
to
raise
here
was
the
jury
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
--
then
you
can't
very
well
say
that
this
refers
to
the
jury
question
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
atkins,
you
can't
raise
a
federal
constitution
question
as
to
the
admissibility
of
confessions,
as
one
question
and
expected
to
hold
over
on
the
--
on
the
question
to
whether
your
jury
was
properly
impaneled,
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
raising
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
i
put
now
all
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
this
with
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
i
want
to
find
out
is
where
you
raised
these
questions
and
where
it
is
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
are
those
the
only
two
places?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
--
where
do
i
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
do
you
--
what
--
what
do
you
raise
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
you
got
to
show
on
printed
record
how
you
raise
the
--
raise
the
federal
question
or
we
can't
determine
whether
it
was
raised.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
what
--
what
you're
reading
from
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well
you
--
you
can't
raise
the
federal
question
on
an
application
for
bail.
can
you
sufficiently
do
to
give
this
court
jurisdiction
if
it
isn't
otherwise
raised?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
where
was
it
presented?
chief
justice
earl
warren
show
me
in
the
record
some
place
please
so
we
can
--
so
we
can
determine
whether
it's
before
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we're
talking
about
what
happened
before
you
came
to
this
court
because
under
the
rules
of
this
court,
we
don't
hear
those
matters
unless
a
federal
question
is
adequately
raised
below.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
was
under
the
state
law?
under
your
state
constitution
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
will
you
show
us
in
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
the
court
where
they
considered
this
question
and
decided
it?
if
they
did,
if
your
supreme
court
considered
this
question,
jury
question
and
decided
it
no
matter
how
it
was
raised,
i
guess
that's
sufficient
but
show
me
where
they
did
say
that,
if
they
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
they
cite
any
federal
cases
or
--
or
mentioned
the
constitutional
section?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
would
be
one
thing
if
you
could
show
us
where
you
raised
it
and
they
didn't
discussed
it
perhaps
where
they
neither
discussed
it
nor
can
you
show
where
you
raised
it
--
it
raises
most
serious
question
mr.
atkins
as
to
whether
you
hear
it
properly
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
atkins,
that
refers
to
the
petition
in
this
court
not
as
to
anything
that
happened
below
this
court.
it
says
the
questions
raised
by
the
petition
that
means
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
that's
what
this
brief
is
opposing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
can't
help
you
any
so
far
as
what
happened
before
you
came
here.
it's
unfortunate
that
the
response
didn't
mention
the
fact
that
a
question
haven't
been
raised
before
but
it
did
--
but
we
do
have
it
before
is
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
what
document?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
that
doesn't
--
what
they
relied
on
doesn't
mean
what
you
raised
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
we
could
--
mr.
atkins,
i
wonder
if
we
could
hear
from
the
other
side
for
just
a
few
moments
on
this
and
then
you
can
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
won't
take
all
your
time
but
i
--
i
would
likely
want
to
straighten
out.
yes
sir,
will
you
please
--
proceed
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
13
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
the
constitution
on
the
statute
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
they
have
the
same
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
glasgow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
atkins,
you
have
about
three
minutes
if
you
have
anything
in
conclusion,
you
would
like
to
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
as
to
the
next
case,
number
79.
i
think
it
would
sever
a
little
purpose
to
start
arguing
that
tonight.
we'd
have
to
go
over
until
after
the
first
year
anyway.
so,
let
it
be
the
first
case
of
the
year,
january
5th.
