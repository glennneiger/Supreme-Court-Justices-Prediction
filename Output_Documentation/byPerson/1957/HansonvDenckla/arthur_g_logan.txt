mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i'm
arthur
logan
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
--
for
the
petitioners
in
117.
frankly,
i
regret
that
i
cannot
answer
mr.
foulk.
mr.
rosenblatt
will
do
so.
many
things
he
said
which
will,
however,
touch
upon
the
case
i
have.
they're
companion
cases.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i'm
representing
--
i'm
a
petitioner
in
the
delaware
case.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
the
delaware
case
--
we're
here
because
the
delaware
supreme
court
would
not
accord
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida
supreme
court
judgement.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i'm
not
in
his
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
no,
i
--
i
don't
contest
that.
but
i
mean
--
when
i
said
i
can't
answer
him,
i'm
not
in
his
case.
my
--
a
lot
of
what
i
will
say
will
be
answered
to
him.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
we're
on
opposite
sides.
oh
yes,
i'm
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
have
disagree
with
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
and
everything.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
think
the
more
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
the
more
i
study
these
two
cases
and
with
this
idea
of
that,
that
delaware
should
have
followed
florida.
florida
had
a
judgment
against
all
these
people
first.
i
come
to
the
conclusion
the
progressive
power
was
very
astute
when
he
said
which
is
quoted
in
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
vanderbilt
versus
vanderbilt.
it
seemed
so
simple
that
it
should
be
obvious
to
anyone
who
has
never
become
confused
by
studying
law.
that's
i
think
where
we
are.
and
here
we
have
two
cases.
one
started
in
florida
and
one
later
in
delaware.
same
parties,
same
facts,
same
issues,
same
problem
who
gets
$400,000,
same
type
of
relief,
declaratory
judgments
requested
in
both
cases.
same
procedures
followed
that
both
groups
in
both
cases
by
across
motions
for
summary
judgment
as
there
were
no
facts
in
dispute.
everything
was
the
same
except
the
opinions
of
the
court
and
the
judges.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes,
identical
for
all
necessary
forms.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes,
an
indispensable
parties.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
all
--
all
parties
are
the
same
except
in
mr.
steel's
brief,
he
--
i
--
i
will
get
to
that.
he
raised
some
question
about
a
remote
contingency
made
of
that
--
had
been
named
in
florida.
what
i
mean
from
the
standpoint
of
this
$400,000
we're
talking
about,
all
the
parties
have
any
claim
of
possession
to
it
in
florida.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
it
was
by
constructive
service,
publication
and
mail.
that's
what
i
want
to
come
to
under
the
mcgee
case.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well,
the
only
difference
of
the
significance
is
that
they
were
construed
differently
and
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
the
two
courts,
each
said
that
this
was
--
this
was
a
matter
of
first
impression,
as
to
the
type
of
trust
created.
each
came
to
a
different
conclusion.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
florida
said
we
have
jurisdiction.
florida
supreme
court
said
we
have
jurisdiction
all
--
of
all
the
parties
including
wilmington
trust
company
and
delaware
trust
company
by
constructive
service
or
process
on
them.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well
the
conclusion
hasn't
been
reached
but
it
is
that
type
of
case.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
if
--
if
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
the
--
if
the
constructive
service
was
good,
then
it
is
that
case.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
the
--
if
we
want
to
reach
and
i
think
mcgee
case
decided
here
last
december
to
solve
that
question.
your
honor
asked
about
whether
this
case
in
florida
started
in
the
probate
court,
made
any
difference.
in
our
brief,
we
pointed
out
that
this
case
was
started
in
a
circuit
court
under
a
statutory
authority,
giving
the
circuit
courts
down
there.
section
8702
of
the
florida
statute
annotated,
deals
with
declaratory
decrease,
provide
that
any
person
claiming
to
be
interested
or
who
may
be
in
doubt
as
to
his
rights
under
will,
may
have
any
question
of
construction
or
validity
arising
under
such
will
determine
and
obtain
a
declaration
of
his
rights
thereunder.
that
statutory
authority
was
placed
in
the
circuit
court
not
in
probate
court
and
also
by
statute
provided
that
constructive
service
of
process
may
be
passed
upon
defendants
in
--
in
a
case
of
that
sort.
now,
if
i
may,
those
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
i
think
your
honor
had
--
probably
had
in
mind
the
mullane
case,
it's
some
kind
of
a
bank
where
it
was
i
think
in
a
court
--
statutory
court
with
the
settlements
of
accounts,
but
this
is
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
it's
never
been
questioned
in
florida.
now,
if
i
may
go
back.
mrs.
donner
died
leaving
many
children
and
many
grandchildren
and
the
will
and
a
trust
agreement
under
which
she
had
powers
to
appoint
at
her
death.
she
moved
to
florida
in
1944
and
lived
there
until
1952
when
she
died.
when
she
died,
found
that
she
had
exercised
a
power
of
appointment
under
this
so-called
trust,
providing
that
--
this
$400,000
we're
talking
about.
under
that
power
of
appointment,
that
$400,000
will
be
taken
out
of
these
trust
assets
and
placed
in
two
existing
trust
for
two
of
her
grandchildren
who
were
children
of
her
daughter,
mrs.
hanson,
who
was
named
the
executrix.
so
over
here,
we
have
--
if
the
trust
of
the
state
is
good
and
if
the
power
is
good,
the
$400,000
go
into
two
trusts,
existing
trust
for
two
grandchildren.
however,
if
either
their
trust
agreement
was
invalid
or
if
the
power
of
appointment
was
not
properly
exercised,
then
under
the
terms
of
the
will,
that
same
$400,000
would
go
into
two
different
trusts
for
two
other
daughters
of
hers
other
than
mrs.
hanson,
the
executrix.
now
these
two
daughters
started
this
action
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
trust
and
the
exercise
of
the
power
under
it.
they
named
as
defendants,
these
two
grandchildren,
their
mother,
and
many
other
people
who
are
really
unnecessary
to
this
question
because
there
were
other
earlier
powers
and
everybody
practically
whoever
been
named
was
put
in
as
defendant.
the
two
children
preserved
and
then
their
mother
came
in
and
had
herself
appointed
as
a
guardian
ad
litem.
so
the
executrix
within
the
florida
court,
she
was
guardian
ad
litem
for
her
children
in
a
family
squabble
over
$400,000.
every
single
one
of
these
people,
who
were
interested
in
that
money,
lived
in
florida
and
had
for
a
long
time.
this
is
a
florida
fight
in
a
florida
court
between
two
rival
groups
of
beneficiaries
for
this
$400,000,
$400,000
would
go
into
this
trust
or
the
other
trust.
now
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
assuming
the
validity
of
the
trust,
the
legal
title
was
in
the
trust
company
in
delaware.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
now,
i
say
all
the
beneficial
parties
were
in
florida.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
no.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
want
to
--
trustees
didn't
have
it,
she
has
it.
mrs.(voice
overlap)
in
her
lifetime,
mrs.
donner.
the
trust
which
she
has
established
with
wilmington
trust
company
was
one
where
she
reserved
the
right
to
revoke
it,
change
it
in
any
way
she
wanted,
withdraw
a
part
with
all
the
corpus
to
change
the
trustees,
to
change
advisors,
the
trustees
had
to
do
what
the
advisors
told
her
and
she
reserved
the
right
to
name
who
she'd
take
upon
her
death.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
it
--
it
was
held
really,
that
it
was
created
merely
an
agency,
not
a
true
trust
and
that
the
power,
the
exercise
of
the
power
under
by
one
witness
only
did
not
comply
with
florida
or
delaware
for
that
testamentary.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
no.
well,
wilmington
trust
--
there's
only
one
trustee
involved
that
would
have
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
--
really
a
dry
trust
--
there's
testimony
in
the
record
we
took
that
they
never
took
a
single
act
of
their
own
but
only
acted
under
the
control
and
advise
of
the
advisor.
every
transaction
is
dictated
by
the
advisor
of
the
trust.
they
never
once
exercised
judgment.
they
never
even
reviewed
these
things.
they
were
given
some
securities.
they
were
told
when
to
sell,
or
when
to
buy
and
they
just
sat
there,
took
coupons,
took
their
fee
and
turned
over
to
her
during
her
lifetime
the
income.
and
that's
why
the
florida
court
held
it
wasn't
a
trust
at
all.
it's
an
agency
agreement.
in
delaware,
they
were
holding
assets
for
--
now
answering
your
question,
justice
whittaker,
if
florida
is
right,
the
title
was
in
florida
because
then
he
was
only
an
agent
in
delaware
holding
the
(inaudible).
you
--
you
asked
me
the
question,
you
ask
assuming
that
it
was
a
true
trust
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
if
it's
true
trust
then
you
would
have
a
title
in
delaware.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
but
if
florida
--
the
florida
court
is
right,
then
you
have
a
title
in
florida.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
the
question.
now,
the
wilmington
trust
company
and
delaware
trust
company
were
named
in
florida
served
by
constructive
process.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that's
a
question
that
should
be
entertained
even
by
this
court.
i
think
you
must
come
to
the
conclusion
of
whether
or
not
when
all
these
parties
--
when
the
parties
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
mean
on
the
merits.
yes,
sir.
i
mean
you
might
whether
--
whether
or
not
it's
a
trust
or
an
agency.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
now,
our
position
is
this.
florida
took
jurisdiction
first
over
the
beneficiary
certainly
and
by
constructive
service
of
process
which
i
say
under
the
mcgee
case,
mr.
justice
black
wrote
in
december
a
constructive
service
of
process
over
wilmington
trust
and
delaware
trust
was
sufficient
to
enable
florida
to
render
a
judgment
binding
on
them
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
mcgee,
it
was
an
action
on
insurance
policy.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
the
standard
setup,
minimum
contact
with
the
state.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
we'll
take
wilmington
trust
first.
the
19
--
from
the
time
mrs.
donner
moved
to
in
florida
1944
whether
we
take
the
florida
court
decision
that
it
was
an
agency
or
whether
we
take
and
say
it's
a
trust
agreement,
wilmington
trust
acted
for
her,
took
coupons,
took
its
fee,
remitted
the
proceeds
to
her.
took
instructions
from
the
adviser
she
appointed
and
she
changed
her
advisers
from
time
to
time.
she
at
one
time
asked
to
the
senders
part
of
the
corpus
which
they
did.
she
did
return
it.
she
had
had
to.
she
could've
taken
all
of
them.
she
had
wilmington
trust
company
acting
for
her
from
1944
while
she
was
a
florida
resident
in
1952
and
certainly
they
have
more
than
minimum
contacts
in
my
humble
view.
there
--
this
--
in
other
words,
this
trust
company
is
acting
really
either
--
it's
either
her
trustee
or
her
agent.
she's
in
florida
all
the
time.
and
on
--
as
they're
all
doing
is
clipping
coupons,
taking
instructions
from
her
advisers
as
to
--
well
they
--
they
issued
orders
to
buy
and
sell
and
change
the
securities.
the
instructor
would
say,
“buy
this,
sell
that,
pay
that,
take
that
money”
and
--
and
they
followed
those
instructions,
testimony
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
oh
yes,
certainly.
i
mean,
after
all
if
your
eight
--
if
your
trustee
is
up
there
for
eight
years,
you
certainly
in
--
in
quarterly
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
the
minimum
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
i
feel
that
the
minimum
contacts
there
are
as
great
if
not
greater
of
the
minimum
contacts
in
mcgee
where
mail
was
being
used
to
send
premiums.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
in
mcgee,
the
insurance
company
had
none.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
think
that
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
mcgee
goes
much
further
than
insurance
company
probably.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
that
was
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
it
talks
about
striking
down
to
a
certain
extent,
state
lines
and
allowing
judgments
where
they
call
them
in
personam
in
rem
or
what
we
call
them
to
be
made
binding
upon
nonresidents
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
--
when
they
have
a
minimum
contact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well,
i
--
i
certainly
it
was
an
insurance
company
but
the
language
is
not
confined
to
the
insurance
company
and
it
talks
about
minimum
contacts.
it
says
that
there's
no
real
standard
as
to
how
they
could
be
set
up
for
every
case.
every
case
may
--
really
has
to
be
decided
probably
on
its
own.
but
the
strict
doctrine
in
pennoyer
versus
neff
has
been
breaking
down,
breaking
down,
breaking
down
as
pointed
out
in
that
case
and
earlier
in
mullane
versus
central
hanover.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
the
court
please.
the
language
--
your
honors
are
all
familiar
with
the
language
in
mcgee
i'm
sure
and
as
it
applies
here,
i
am
convinced
that
certainly
to
use
the
word
minimum
contacts
and
in
the
next
standard,
notions
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice.
fair
play,
take
that.
is
it
unfair
to
ask
wilmington
trust
company,
i'm
treating
with
that
first
because
delaware
trust
company
practically
stepped
into
its
shoes
in
$400,000
over
as
soon
as
they're
involved,
is
it
fair
to
ask
them
to
go
to
florida
where
their
beneficiaries
were
when
their
trust
was
challenged?
was
it
unfair?
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
no,
i
don't
suppose
it
was
unfair.
let's
get
back
to
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
let's
get
back
--
let's
get
back
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
delaware
case,
mrs.
hanson,
the
executrix
of
the
will.
after
this
family
fight,
it
was
at
issue
and
going
in
florida
ready
for
decision.
she
ran
to
delaware.
nobody
lived
in
delaware.
the
two
trust
companies
were
up
there,
she
named
22
defendants,
29
residents.
and
she
stayed
home.
the
case
would
have
been
decided
there.
a
florida
resident
not
satisfied
to
this
except
the
judgment
of
her
own
state
and
her
own
state
enjoined
her
from
proceeding
with
the
case.
but
of
course,
she
did
not
plan
so
many
people
by
then
the
case
went
on.
but
was
it
unfair
--
of
course
it's
the
winter
of
1954
and
1958.
i
think
the
weather
was
better,
it
was
unfair
to
ask
the
attorneys
for
wilmington
trust
company
and
delaware
trust
company
to
go
down
to
florida
and
let
me
point
out
something
here
which
i
think
some
choose
this
question.
they
don't
even
care
enough
about
that
to
ask
to
argue
their
position
here.
they
turned
it
over
to
mr.
steel
who's
been
carrying
the
ball
and
he's
going
to
carry
here
in
this
court.
and
he
is
representing
three
of
the
children
of
mrs.
hanson
who
ran
to
delaware
and
they
are
florida
residents.
so
you
will
hear
not
from
wilmington
trust.
they
did
file
a
brief
here
saying
that
they
were
not
subject
to
service
in
florida.
but
is
it
unfair
to
ask
them
to
do
what
they're
really
doing
in
this
court.
they're
not
down
here
to
argue
this
case.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well,
the
standard
in
mcgee
is
our
--
is
our
minimum
contact
--
minimum
contacts
which
i
say
there
are
when
you
have
this
relationship
of
whether
it's
trustee,
beneficiary,
principal
agent.
those
are
enough
contacts
to
give
the
court
in
florida
in
this
case
under
its
statute
which
allows
someone
who
wants
a
construction
of
a
will
to
come
in
and
serve
them
by
constructive
process.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
think
so
when
you
treat
the
practical
effect
of
having
a
trustee
and
a
beneficiary
living
in
different
states.
the
trustee
has
the
assets
for
investment
and
reinvestment.
this
case
will
tell
you
how
to
do
it.
they
were
subject
to
being
removed
at
any
moment.
they
were
in
constant
contact
with
their
trustee.
they
were
collecting
the
money.
they're
getting
paid
to
do
it.
they're
collecting
the
money
and
giving
it
to
her.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
the
contact
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
right.
oh,
yes.
well
i
say
that's
the
contact.
their
contact
with
florida,
is
they're
making
their
money
out
of
florida.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
maybe
under
that
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well,
if
you
take
this
minimum
contact.
now
what
--
i
think
you
got
more
than
minimum
contact
when
you're
talking
about
a
trustee
and
a
beneficiary,
they're
a
daily
contact.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
true.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
--
that's
right.
if
--
if
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
--
that's
true.
if
it's
an
agency
there's
no
question
of
what
the
florida
court
had
complete
jurisdiction.
the
assets
were
there.
everything
was
there.
now
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well,
i
--
i
think
that
gets
into
a
question
really
of
merit
where
assuming
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
assuming
the
trust
company
had
gone
into
florida
and
the
florida
court
--
they
had
appeared
and
the
florida
court
had
come
up
with
this
judgment,
that
would
certainly
be
binding
on
these
parties
even
though
they
applied
florida
law
because
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
you
cannot
go
into
the
question
of
whether
the
merits
have
been
properly
decided,
you
can
go
into
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
now,
i
would
doubt
is
this
court
could
entertain
that
question
if
wilmington
trust
company
and
delaware
trust
had
voluntarily
appeared
and
we
have
the
same
judgment
we
have,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
jurisdiction
in
this
court
to
question
florida's
right
to
apply
florida
law
in
that
situation.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
think
so,
it
could
then.
i
might
say
this
when
the
--
when
these
courts
were
dealing
with
this
question,
it's
the
question
of
whether
or
not
all
these
cumulative
reserve
powers
in
this
woman,
whether
they
didn't
break
it
down
as
a
trust
to
make
it
an
agency,
florida
says,
that
was
so,
it
was
an
agency.
delaware
now
with
its
cumulative
powers
did
not
transfer
it
from
a
trust
to
an
agency.
but
both
courts
said,
it
was
a
matter
of
first
impression
with
them.
so
when
you're
talking
in
florida
of
what
florida
should
do
even
though
the
delaware
courts
later
talk
about
florida
law
and
of
delaware
law,
florida
was
hoping
to
find
the
answer
to
this
question
of
these
cumulative
powers
in
this
situation
and
had
the
beneficiary
before
it
and
as
we
say
had
before
it
the
constructive
service
of
the
two
trustees
who
were
the
stakeholders.
and
florida
decided
that
the
money
should
go
into
the
trust
for
the
daughters
and
not
into
the
trust
for
the
grandchildren.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
no.
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
right.
i
mean
the
--
somebody
--
$400,000
is
either
going
to
two
grandchildren
or
two
daughters
and
i
don't
think
anyone's
going
to
starve
whichever
it
goes
but
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
somebody
is
going
to
lose.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
you
mean
the
question
whether
there's
jurisdiction
in
the
florida
court
in
that
situation
regardless
of
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
--
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well
that
of
course,
mr.
rosenblatt
will
treat
that.
he
--
he
is
the
appellee
in
the
--
for
the
appellee
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well,
the
agency
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
question.
it
can't
be.
it
can't
be
any
question
as
florida
has
a
complete
jurisdiction
on
it.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
don't
think
so
because
the
principle
then
would
be
in
court.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that
would
be
an
adjudication.
then
of
course
the
adjudication
would
determine
as
it
--
we
say
it
has
done
in
florida.
the
adjudication
then
determines
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well
the
trust
had
to
be
construed
to
find
out
what
went
under
the
will
because
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
yes.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
the
will
provides
that
any
unexercised
powers
would
go
under
the
residuary
clause,
and
also
if
these
--
if
there
was
--
of
this
is
an
agency,
of
course,
that
assets
belong
into
the
estate.
so
you've
got
to
--
to
construe
the
will
to
find
out
what
goes
under
the
will,
it's
necessary
to
test
whether
or
not
this
trust
agreement
is
a
trust
agreement
or
an
agency
and
next
whether
or
not
the
power
was
properly
exercised
because
if
the
power
wasn't
exercised
properly,
then
under
the
trust
agreement
itself,
this
$400,000
goes
back
under
the
will.
these
are
all
the
contacts
which
are
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
well
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
that's
his
problem
but
if
--
if
the
delaware
--
if
--
if
this
court
holds
that
delaware
erred
and
not
acquiring
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida
judgment,
then
i
assume
the
delaware
courts
will
act
accordingly
and
enforce
the
florida
judgment
in
delaware
and
see
that
the
$400,000
held
by
the
delaware
trust
company,
curiously
enough
they'll
still
keep
$200,000
in
another
--
in
a
different
trust
and
they'll
turn
over
$200,000.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
she
returned,
as
i
understand,
she
returned
these
securities
at
all
time
and
paid
florida
tax
on.
and
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
florida
--
florida
intangible
personal
property
tax
are
paid
on
these
securities
at
all
times.
there's
another
contact
really.
and
furthermore
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
i
don't
know.
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
they
--
she
did
pay
it.
i
know
that's
in
the
record.
and
also,
this
very
$417,000
was
returned
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
delaware
case,
the
executrix
as
part
of
the
florida
state.
her
return
in
the
probate
court
in
florida,
she
lists
this
$400,000
as
an
asset
--
mr.
arthur
g.
logan
what's
that?
