mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
as
guardian
ad
litem
appointed
by
the
court
of
chancery
for
three
minors
who
have
beneficial
interest
under
one
of
the
delaware
trust
company
which
was
an
appointee,
one
of
the
delaware
trust
company
trusts.
the
--
because
of
the
time
limitations
or
rather
i
should
say
the
number
of
counsel
limitations
which
were
imposed,
the
wilmington
trust
company
and
delaware
trust
company
has
also
consented
that
i
say
what
need
to
be
said
on
their
behalf.
i
have
represented
neither
of
those
institutions
in
the
litigation.
the
interest
of
my
clients,
of
course,
is
sustaining
the
delaware
judgment
and
the
validity
of
the
trust.
let
me
cite
preliminarily
what
i
think
is
not
an
issue
here.
this
court
is
not
concerned
with
the
merits
of
the
question
of
whether
the
1935
trust
was
an
agency
agreement
or
an
inter
vivos
trust
that
presents
no
federal
question.
there
is
substantial
authority
which
would
support
the
delaware
view
on
that.
recent
action
taken
by
the
restatement
in
may
of
this
year,
cited
on
page
5
of
the
brief
of
the
wilmington
trust
company
is
authority
for
the
validity
as
a
trust
of
such
an
agreement.
what
this
court
is
concerned
with
is
or
are
two
constitutional
questions
which
were
separate
in
the
state.
and
as
it
seems
to
me
clearcut
analysis
the
problem
requires
at
all
times
that
a
distinction
be
kept
in
mind.
the
first
is
the
full
faith
and
credit
question
as
to
whether
delaware
should
be
bound
by
the
florida
judgment
because
as
we
contend,
florida
was
lacking
in
jurisdiction
over
indispensable
parties
and
hence
the
judgment
is
binding
on
no
one.
the
second
constitutional
question
is
one
which
would
arise
if
the
court
should
resolve
that
first
question
adversely
to
my
clients.
on
the
hypothesis,
as
to
mr.
justice
black,
put
it
that
everybody
was,
in
fact,
before
the
florida
court.
did
florida
choose
the
right
law
when
it
shows
florida
law
and
not
delaware
law?
and
under
teachings
of
this
court,
the
erroneous
choice
of
law
can
interrupt
--
can
deprive
a
judgment
based
on
the
erroneous
choice
of
law
of
due
process.
now
there
are
two
separate
questions.
let
me
address
myself
first
if
i
may
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
court
over
the
delaware
trust
company
and
the
wilmington
trust
company.
that
jurisdiction
purportedly
came
about
by
virtue
of
a
florida
statute
which
contained
10
subdivisions,
9
of
which
dealt
with
in
rem
actions.
the
one,
under
which
the
court
purported
to
act
presumably
and
the
decision
of
florida
says
nothing
about
it,
is
one
which
authorized
the
service
by
publication
for
the
construction
of
a
will,
deed,
contract
or
other
written
instrument
and
for
the
judicial
declaration
or
enforcement
of
legal
or
equitable
rights
thereunder.
and
let
me
start
and
approach
the
problem
with
what
i'm
going
to
call
pre-mcgee
law
and
then
speak
of
mcgee
against
insurance
company
and
what
if
any
impact
it
may
have
on
the
problem.
certainly
--
certainly,
absent
the
minimum
contact
theory,
the
court
where
a
will
has
been
probated
has
no
jurisdiction
in
a
plenary
action
to
determine
whether
out-of-state
property,
owned
by
out-of-state
people
or
let
me
put
it
this
way,
whether
out-of-state
property
claimed
by
out-of-state
people,
ownership
of
which
is
claimed
by
out-of-state
people
can
be
rested
and
determine
--
taken
from
and
repost
in
the
hands
of
the
administrators.
this
isn't
a
question
and
i
think
the
distinction
is
important
as
to
whether
or
not
out-of-state
properties
owned
by
the
decedent
passes
in
one
way
or
another
under
the
florida
will.
this
is
a
much
more
basic
question
than
that.
this
is
a
question
of
whether
out-of-state
property
is,
in
fact,
owned
by
the
florida
decedent.
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
this
case
is
no
different
leaving
aside
minimum
contacts
for
the
moment.
this
case
is
no
different
that
it
would
have
been
if
the
administrator
had
filed
a
suit
against
the
delaware
resident
who
held
shares
of
stock
owned
by
the
decedent
and
claim
that
those
shares
of
stock
had
been
transferred
by
the
decedent
during
her
lifetime,
as
a
result
of
fraud
and
deception
practiced
upon
her
and
had
asked
that
that
ownership
or
rather
claim
of
ownership
out-of-state
could
be
adjudicated
in
florida.
i
see
that
there's
no
difference
this
court
in
the
bakers,
the
eccles
case
has
held
that
the
court
of
domicile
of
a
decedent
could
not
determine
in
a
plenary
action
against
the
nonresident
where
intangibles
were
held
that
the
interest
of
that
nonresident
in
those
intangibles
was
cut
off.
now
that
has
been
--
was
based
on
pennoyer
v.
neff
and
i
think
pennoyer
v.
neff
has
never
been
willed
away
in
those
circumstances
unless,
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
minimum
contact,
it
was
on
some
minimum
contact
theory.let
me
say
preliminary
about
minimum
contact.
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
unless
the
trust
companies
were
brought
in
to
the
florida
court
and
--
and
--
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
yes.
i
would
say
so.
now,
when
we
come
around
to
minimum
contacts,
i
want
to
look
at
the
minimum
contact
first
or
let
me
say
before
i
get
to
talking
about
the
facts
which
you
brought
--
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
it's
defeatable
only
by
action
by
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
yes.
that's
right.
and
that
--
that
was
the
situation
in
this
1935
agreement.
though
there
were
remain
--
they
were
remainder
interest
created
by
the
agreement.
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
that's
correct.
florida
doesn't
have
a
minimum
contact
statute
such
as
california
had
which
provided
that
if
an
insurance
policy
was
delivered
to
a
beneficiary
in
california
and
premiums
were
paid
from
california
that
that
insurance
company
was
amenable
to
in
personam
jurisdiction
in
california.
this
statute
which
i
read
doesn't
profess
to
do
that,
it
doesn't
profess
to
lay
down
any
standards
of
any
kind.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
florida
court
didn't
base
its
theory
on
any
minimum
contact
theory.
and
i
submit
that
the
delaware
court
was
entitled
to
take
that
florida
decision
as
it
would
writ
without
minimum
contacts
and
measure
it
against
constitutional
requirements
to
see
whether
it
was
right
or
whether
it
was
wrong.
it
wasn't
incumbent
on
the
delaware
court
to
delve
around
the
theories
of
all
sorts
to
see
whether
the
florida
court
might
have
relied
on
those
theories
but
didn't.
but
passing
that,
passing
that
and
coming
down
to
the
minimum
contact
business,
the
delaware
trust
company,
as
appointee
of
$400,000,
it
was
the
trust
company
of
a
trust,
as
to
which
the
decedent
had
no
--
nothing
to
do.
the
decedent
wasn't
the
settlor
of
the
trust.
the
decedent
wasn't
the
income
beneficiary
of
the
trust
and
the
trust
was
irrevocable.
so
that
the
content
which
florida
had
with
the
institution
which
now
holds
the
assets
and
which
held
the
assets
as
a
result
of
the
distribution
which
was
made
before
the
florida
suit
has
began.
the
only
contact
which
florida
has
--
had
there
is
because
the
beneficiary
is
under
that
trust
resided
in
florida,
that's
the
contact.
now,
is
a
contact
which
those
beneficiaries
have
with
the
trustee
because
of
their
beneficial
interest?
such
a
contact
as
to
permit
a
third
party
to
come
in
and
say
that
because
of
that
isolated,
insulated
type
of
contact,
a
third
party
can
hale
into
the
florida
court
and
get,
if
you
please,
not
in
rem
jurisdiction
but
as
the
florida
court
said
clearly,
in
personam
jurisdiction,
in
personam
jurisdiction.
i
submit
that
that's
not
the
kind
of
a
contact.
it's
not
the
kind
of
an
evil
which
this
court
was
dealing
with
or
considering
in
the
mcgee
against
insurance
company.
now,
what
was
the
contact
which
--
and
i
say
this.
that
in
the
absence
of
the
delaware
trust
company
regardless
of
what
contacts
the
wilmington
trust
company
might
have
had,
in
the
absence
of
the
delaware
trust
company
which
holds
those
assets
and
held
the
assets
when
the
florida
action
was
began,
florida
had
no
jurisdiction
to
make
an
adjudication
unless
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
trust
company
and
those
minimum
contacts
i've
described
is
more
than
sufficient
to
give
it
to
him.
now,
so
far
as
the
wilmington
trust
company
is
concerned,
the
1935
trust
was
created
when
mrs.
donner
lived
in
philadelphia
in
1935.
nine
years
later,
she
moved
to
florida.
she
exercised
of
the
first
two
powers
when
she
lived
in
pennsylvania.
she
exercised
the
third
power
when
she
was
residing
in
florida.
she
exercised
it
in
pennsylvania
as
shown
by
the
delaware
record.
and
she
exercised
the
fourth
power
in
montreal,
canada.
and
that's
shown
in
the
gold
affidavit
which
is
not
mentioned
in
our
brief
but
is
at
page
295
of
the
delaware
record.
now
it's
true
that
mrs.
donner
did
reserve
a
life
interest
in
the
right
to
exercise
these
powers.
but
that
wasn't
a
contact
which
she
had
when
that
trust
was
created.
wilmington
trust
company
didn't
go
into
florida
by
any
voluntary
act
of
its
own;
it
was
taken
into
florida,
so
to
speak,
when
the
settlor
moved
into
florida.
and
i
suggest
to
you
again
that
that
type
of
contact
is
completely
different
than
the
type
of
contact
you
have
in
a
case
like
international
shoe
where
you
have
business
being
solicited
by
the
defendant
who
would
be
held.
the
type
of
contact
you
had
in
mcgee
against
insurance
company
or
the
type
of
contact
you
have
where
you
served
a
non
--
a
nonresident
motorist
to
voluntarily
come
in.
now,
my
friend
may
argue
that
--
that
the
wilmington
trust
company
could
have
gone
into
court
and
asked
to
have
been
relieved
of
its
responsibilities
and
that
type
of
non-action
resulted
in
its
further
contacts
in
distributing
income,
and
let
me
say
something
about
that
in
some
sort
of
a
contact.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
delaware
record
shows
that
there
was
no
income
sent
down
to
florida
to
mrs.
donner.
it
was
all
put
in
the
wilmington
trust
company
who
worked
out
and
the
advisors
of
the
trust
in
philadelphia
were
informed
of
it.
the
record
also
shows
that
when
there
were
purchases
and
sales
of
securities,
mrs.
donner
was
never
advised
of
it.
the
information
all
went
to
these
life
long
associates
or
her
families
in
philadelphia
who
were
advisors
of
the
trust
and
they
were
told
about
it.
when
proxies
were
sent
for
execution,
they
weren't
sent
to
mrs.
donner
after
the
banks
had
signed
them
for
sending
into
the
company.
they
were
sent
to
--
in
philadelphia,
so
that
those
contacts
with
florida
were
of
the
minimal
variety.
and
i
suggest
that
this
matter
of
--
of
minimum
contacts,
if
given
the
comprehensive
scope
which
my
adversaries
would
give
to
it,
would
result
in
this
sort
of
a
thing.
stockholder
and
corporation,
many
contacts
between
a
stockholder
and
a
corporation,
proxy
materials
sent,
proxies
are
set
in,
dividends
sent
and
whatnot.
can
it
be
said
that
that
type
of
contact
gives
the
state
where
the
stockholder
lives,
jurisdiction
over
the
corporation
in
any
suit
which
would
be
brought
against
them,
they're
much
more
extensive
than
these
contact
are
in
this
situation.
so
much
for
minimum
contacts
as
we
see,
we
think
that
the
doctrine
of
the
mcgee
against
insurance
company
which
of
course
we
filed
to
was
a
doctrine
which
was
understandable,
which
was
under
a
statute
which
prescribe
standards
of
minimum
contact,
and
did
result
in
the
avoidance
or
will
result
in
avoidance
of
an
evil
of
which
--
which
was
--
which
many
of
us
are
cognizant
of
these
polices
being
written
and
the
burden
being
put
on
a
--
a
beneficiary
to
chase.
now,
let's
pass
the
question
of
--
of
jurisdiction
and
make
the
assumption.
that
on
some
theory,
the
delaware
trust
company
and
the
wilmington
trust
company,
were
brought
in
to
florida
court.
i
think
it
can't
be
sustained
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated.
but
if
that
position
should
be
sustained,
then
i
suggest
that
you
have
this
further
question,
namely,
whether
florida
was
wrong
in
applying
florida
law
to
strike
down
a
relationship
which
was
valid
under
delaware
and
whether
or
not,
that
error
was
not
so
vital
and
basic
as
to
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process.
now
this
court
has
spoken
on
that
subject
on
several
occasions
and
i
--
i'm
sure
it's
a
little
naughty
problem
because
one
time
court
goes
one
seemingly
on
fine
distinctions
goes
one
way
or
another.
but
the
case
we
rely
on
is
the
hartford
against
delta
land
company
case,
where
there
was
fidelity
bond
written
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
that
case,
your
honor,
is
referred
to
--
on
--
it's
292
u.s.
143
and
it's
referred
to
on
pages
29
and
30
of
our
brief.
there
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
fidelity
bond
in
--
written
in
tennessee.
a
defalcation
occurred,
a
defalcation
occurred
in
mississippi.
the
plaintiff
was
a
mississippi
corporation.
the
defendant
was
an
out-of-state
corporation
but
both
were
doing
business
in
mississippi
where
the
defalcation
occurred.
the
bond
contained
a
provision
which
limited
liability
after
a
period
of
time.
that
provision
was
good
in
tennessee
where
the
bond
was
ready.
it
was
bad
under
the
statutes
and
public
policy
of
mississippi.
mississippi
therefore
said,
“plaintiff
can
recover
on
the
bond.”
the
case
went
to
this
court
and
this
court
reversed
saying
that
the
contract
was
a
contract
which
had
its
intimate
relations
with
the
place
where
it
was
written
and
that
law
and
not
mississippi
law
was
controlled.
we
suggest
that
--
that
this
relationship
which
was
created,
which
i
call
a
trust
and
my
friends
call
an
agency
in
delaware
was
a
much
more
static
and
less
ambulatory
or
transient
type
of
relationship
than
you
have
in
the
case
of
a
fidelity
bond
which
ensures
persons
against
losses
all
over
the
country.
and
by
a
fortiori
reason,
by
a
fortiori
reason,
the
principle
of
the
hartford
case
would
apply
to
this
situation
and
that
it
was
wrong
for
the
florida
court
to
cease
all
the
florida
law
to
strike
down
a
relationship
which
was
valid
in
the
state
where
it
was
entered
into.
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
that
part
of
the
record.
i
am
not
here
from
the
florida
judgment.
you
see,
i
--
i
was
the
winner
in
delaware
and
the
question
has
been
raised
by
our
adversaries
but
the
choice
of
law
problem
was
dealt
with
by
the
delaware
supreme
court.
i'm
--
i'm
dwelling
on
recollection.
i'm
reasonably
sure
that
the
florida
record
--
in
the
florida
record,
the
question
of
due
--
constitutionality
of
this
service
over
the
--
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
no.
but
i
--
but
i'm
certain
that
in
the
motions
and
answers
--
in
the
answer
and
in
the
motion
in
florida,
you'll
find
that
the
--
that
the
--
those
due
process
questions
were
raised
insofar
as
florida
was
attempting
to
get
service
over
the
delaware
trust
company
and
wilmington
trust
company.
i'm
satisfied
that
that
is
so.
i'm
not
guessing,
i'm
--
i'm
dwelling
on
my
memory.
i
think
i
might
be
able
to
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
what
--
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
the
florida
opinion?
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
i
don't
recollect
that
it
did,
your
honor.
if
it
did,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
d.
steel,
jr.
well,
i
don't
put
my
hand
right
on
the
record
reference
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
know
that
it's
in
the
answer
and
it's
in
the
florida
motion.
