justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
--
was
the
executrix
trying
to
account
in
anyway
in
the
florida
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
accounting
of
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
proceeding
that's
involved
here,
there
was
no
accounting
aspect
of
the
suit
it's
simply
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
a
suit
to
declare
rights
under
the
will,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
your
situation
would
have
been
any
different
if
the
construction
question
had
been
raised
in
the
accounting
proceeding
which
is
not
involved?
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
you
on
the
same
side
of
defense
with
mr.
rosenblatt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
delaware
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
the
parties
are
the
same?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
it
had
no
independent
contacts
to
its
own
in
florida.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
theory,
a
beneficiary
could
always
require
a
trustee
to
account
where
the
beneficiary
wanted
to
live.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
mcgee,
you
think.
you
don't
think
mcgee
goes
upward,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
a
lot
of
your
position
depends
upon
construing
this
instrument
as
an
agency
rather
than
a
trust.
you
have
a
much
more
troublesome
case
in
your
standpoint
if
this
is
regarded
as
a
trust.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore
the
essence
of
the
problem
is
who's
got
the
right,
which
court
has
got
the
right
to
decide
what
this
instrument
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
advance
yourself
very
much
by
saying
and
arguing
to
us
if
this
is
an
agency
and
bypassing
the
question
of
whose
or
which
court
has
got
the
right
to
decide
whether
it's
an
agency
or
a
trust.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
(inaudible)
the
court
says
that
florida
has
jurisdiction,
what
is
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
delaware
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
her
inventory.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
her
inventory.
now
there's
--
i'm
about
to
get
the
red
light
and
here
and
there's
one
point
that
i
want
to
--
i
can't
get
back.
mr.
steel
in
his
brief
makes
much
ado
about
a
curtin
winsor,
jr.
who
was
the
third
son
of
mrs.
hanson,
the
executrix.
and
the
two
of
her
sons
are
these
beneficiaries.
he
says
that
this
son
was
not
named
in
florida
and
that
somewhere
or
other
prevents
the
florida
judgment
to
be
unbinding.
he
was
a
remote
contingent
beneficiary.
it
would
be
necessary
that
if
one
of
his
brothers
to
die
without
issue
and
without
having
exercised
the
power
of
appointment
where
he
will
ever
to
come
into
anything.
he
never
came
into
anything.
they've
got
the
parties
in
our
brief
including
the
principles
announced
by
this
court
that
he
was
--
was
not
necessary
to
name
him
but
of
the
decree
to
be
binding
upon
him
because
if
he
ever
invested
in
anything,
he
would
step
into
the
shoes
of
his
brothers
and
be
able
to
enforce
any
decree
which
is
in
favor
that
is
bound
by
this
one
which
was
against
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understood
your
jurisdiction
or
argument,
you
say
that
no
federal
question
was
raised
by
your
opponents
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
florida
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
looking
at
their
reply
brief,
where
they
answer
that
on
page
5
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
whole
proceeding
and
say
that
it
was.
do
you
take
issue
with
that
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
about
your
opponents'
claim
that
you're
not
on
this
court,
that
you
might
put
it
wrong?
