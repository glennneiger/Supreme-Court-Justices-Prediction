justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
logan.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
connection
with
the
problem
that
we
have,
are
we
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
delaware
supreme
court
or
the
florida
supreme
court
is
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
mean
only
on
the
merits
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
relation
on
mcgee
to
the
presence
of
the
delaware
trust
company?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
so
what's
its
relation?
i
don't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
contact
in
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
contacts,
i
gather
from
your
description
where
largely
as
between
mrs.
donner
in
florida
and
the
trust
company,
correspondence
made
all
those
kinds
of
things,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
think
so
far
as
the
trust
company
is
concerned
in
that
sense,
it
was
in
florida
only
to
the
extent
that
its
correspondents
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
reach
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
logan
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
logan,
suppose
there
were
no
delaware
cases
before
us
here
at
all
and
the
only
case
we
have
here
was
the
florida
case.
wouldn't
we
turn
the
result
simply
on
the
question
whether
the
delaware
companies
with
parties
in
the
manner
that
you
insist
they
were,
that
is
by
contacts
with
the
state
of
florida,
without
ever
reaching
the
question
whether
the
florida
court
was
to
treat
with
the
validity
of
the
trust
under
--under
delaware
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
trying
to
reach
for
is
why
we
have
to
be
concerned
perhaps
we
do.
i'm
just
not
clear
about
it
with
whether
this
is
an
agency
or
a
trust.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
--
if
the
delaware
decree,
if
that
validity
in
a
constitutional
sense
depends
upon
whether
there
was
proper
service
upon
these
delaware
companies.
what
difference
is
it
whether
the
trust
was
an
agency
or
a
trust?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
without
--
they
would
not
need
the
delaware
companies
before
them?
