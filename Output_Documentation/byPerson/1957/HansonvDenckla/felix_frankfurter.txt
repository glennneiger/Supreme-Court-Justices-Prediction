justice
felix
frankfurter
fully
apart
from
full
faith
and
credit,
why
wasn't
it
--
was
it
not
res
judicata
because
the
parties
had
not
been
before
the
power
of
the
court
or
had
not
been
served
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
so-called
interim
proceeding
to
establish
the
will
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
case
get
down
to
this
ultimately,
that
florida,
in
search
for
power
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
--
to
pass
on
the
legal
significance
of
this
power
of
appoint
--
of
this
trust
on
the
theory
that
she
had
jurisdiction
over
the
estate
of
mrs.
donner.
she
could
determine
what
was
swept
within
the
term
of
the
estate,
is
that
the
ultimate
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
ultimate
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
--
whether
a
power
of
--
whether
a
trust
establishes
a
lifetime
of
the
--
of
the
donor
has
to
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
trust
was
established
or
whether,
the
estate
of
the
testamentary
domicile
could
determine
what
passes
under
the
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
issue,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
little
different
if
i
remember
that
case,
that's
the
insurance
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
what
i
think
it
is
because
here,
that
aspect
of
the
case
and
say
there
are
others,
turns
on
the
authority
of
the
estate
of
a
deceased
person
to
determine
what
estate
he
left
in
that
state
that
controls
the
--
the
winding
up
of
the
testamentary
disposition.
and
they
hold
here,
as
i
understand
from
what
you're
telling
me,
they
held
in
florida
that
this
was
a
testamentary
disposition
and
whether
it
was
or
wasn't,
florida,
which
passes
on
what
the
will
is
and
what
its
scope
is
and
not
delaware
which
doesn't
pass
on
that.
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
dispute
about
it?
i
mean
let's
find
out
--
before
you
can
get
an
answer
to
a
question,
one
wants
to
agree
on
what
the
questions
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fly
off
giving
answers
without
agreeing
on
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
she
made
or
attempted
to
make
some
disposition
of
property
inter
vivos
in
delaware.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
property
was
situated
there,
the
parties
were
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what's
the
effect?
what's
the
legal
significance
of
that
disposition
of
property
is
--
is
for
the
state
in
which
it
took
place
where
the
property
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
you
can't
answer
mr.
foulk
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unless
i
misconceive
if
mr.
foulk's
position
is
that
the
construction
of
this
trust,
the
legal
significance
of
the
trust
is
to
be
determined
by
delaware
law.
you're
contesting
for
--
you're
contesting
--
do
you
contest
that
or
do
you
contest
that
the
delaware
court
gave
a
wrong
construction
of
what
its
law
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
you're
on
opposite
view
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
disagree
what
he
just
said
when
he
sat
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
should
think
that
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
i
say
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
the
facts
are
the
same
but
not
that
significant,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean
by
significance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
florida
said
we
can
get
hold
of
the
wilmington
trust
company
if
that's
his
name
because
we
can't
pass
on
the
--
on
what
the
will
says
and
wilmington
and
delaware
says,
“no,
this
is
an
inter
vivos
situation
and
florida
must
give
of
personal
services,”
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
the
case
of
--
it
isn't
the
case
of
a
state
court
having
got
hold
of
a
--
of
a
litigation
in
which
the
parties
were
in
exactly
the
same
situation
in
state
number
one.
and
state
number
one
made
an
adjudication
and
then
one
of
the
parties,
personally
before
state
number
one,
tried
to
upset
that
conclusion
in
state
number
two,
isn't
that
kind
of
a
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
case
except
the
difference
whether
florida
can
make
that
adjudication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
it
is.
that's
the
big
interest
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
those
--
under
those
trusts
making
the
assumption
you
just
made
that
the
trust
is
valid,
did
the
delaware
trustees
have
power
of
changing
into
corpus
and
so
on,
do
they
had
some
broad
power
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
a
trustee
usually
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
basis
of
holding.
it's
the
testamentary
not
inter
vivos?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
lifetime
of
mrs.
donner,
the
two
trustees
were
dry
trustees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
crucial
--
the
crucial
question
is
what
jurisdiction
has
power
to
--
to
say
which
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
suppose
that
mcgee
really
turns
on
it.
the
--
the
question
i
--
i
gather
which
mr.
justice
brennan
once
told.
mcgee
turned
on
a
--
on
a
large
question
as
to
the
power
of
a
state
to
subject
an
insurance
company
to
sue
with
all
the
implication
of
the
relation
of
insurance
company
and
policy
owners
under
the
long
historic
amenability
of
insurance
companies
to
sue
because
of
the
difficulty
between
an
insured
and
the
insurance
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
transfer
this
over
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not
delaware
can
say,
“we
determine
what
the
significance
of
a
trust
agreement
is”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
it
goes
much
further.
that's
what
it's
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
means
that
(voice
overlap)
what
they're
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
the
fact
that
it
was
an
insurance
company
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
result
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
had
supposed
in
vanderbilt
against
vanderbilt
and
pennoyer
and
neff
were
very
strongly
relied
upon
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
broken
down
there.
it
was
lifted
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
ask
you
another
fair
and
unfair.
was
it
unfair
for
mrs.
donner
in
delaware
if
delaware
allowed
it
to
make
this
kind
of
an
arrangement?
was
it
unfair?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
suspect
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it
were
florida
--
suppose
it
was
a
florida
--
suppose
a
delaware
statute
had
spelled
out
explicitly
what
the
delaware
court
had
spelled
out
by
decision
and
the
question
then
arose
as
it
was
hypothesized
in
the
colloquy
between
justice
black
and
yourself.
suppose
the
statute
and
the
florida
court
said
we
pay
no
attention
to
the
delaware
statute
then
it
could
come
up
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
us,
this
isn't
a
--
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
indicated,
this
is
not
a
problem
for
us,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
somebody
is
going
to
benefit
by
this
suit
but
that's
quite
immaterial
to
us
and
the
problem
before
the
court
is
the
relationship
of
states
in
this
complicated
thing
called
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
somebody
is
going
to
lose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
certainly
had
another
complicated
fact
(inaudible)
cases
are
simple.
is
the
florida
tax
and
the
securities
in
delaware?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wait
a
minute.
paid
what
for
what?
is
it
a
part
of
income
tax
or
--
or
did
she
pay
a
personal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
she
did
choose
--
if
florida
--
if
she
has
resisted,
florida
could
impose
it?
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
scope
of
the
(inaudible)
case
is.
i
don't
know
the
scope
of
the
principle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
rosenblatt
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
had
been
a
collection
of
(inaudible)
and
rembrandt
in
delaware
as
far
as
it
could
have
imposed
a
tax.
and
that
is
because
of
the
major
so-call
intangibles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
i'm
telling
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
telling
you
that
if
they
have
been
rembrandt
pictures
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
have
been
passed
by
florida
under
this
agreement.
that's
what
the
(inaudible)
case
is
and
it
seems
nothing
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
florida
has
power
to
tax
the
person
rendered
in
florida
with
non-physical
properties
such
as
intangible
proceeds
certificates,
it
doesn't
give
me
the
answer
to
who
decide
what
the
meaning
of
this
instrument
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
would
say
the
same
thing
if
these
were
an
incontestable
trust?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
all
the
parties
except
the
trustee
was
before
the
florida
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
other
states?
can
florida
determine
what
delaware
should
consider
such
an
instrument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
may
have
to
care
if
delaware
has
the
controlling
authority
of
saying,
“what
disposition
should
be
made
of
a
property
situation
within
delaware?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
this.
now,
if
i
go
to
professor
scott,
second
edition
of
his
trust.
will
i
find
there
that
he
said
such
a
trust
though
delaware
is
funny
and
fanciful
and
unique
and
having
it
is
no
good,
can
we
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
does
he
say
that
such
a
recognition
of
a
trustee
in
delaware
violates
all
notions
of
trust.
and
he
say
that
in
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
he
say
there's
no
authority
the
other
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
potential
beneficiary,
who
is
governed
by
delaware
law
has
no
standing
here
either?
justice
felix
frankfurter
beneficiary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
whether
they
have
no
standing
here
since
your
colleague,
mr.
logan
says
it
makes
a
difference
who
gets
the
$417,000.
i
think
that's
a
substantial
amount
of
standard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
it
a
fact
that
it
makes
the
difference
of
who
gets
the
$417,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
suggesting
to
that
--
that
usually
fell
standing
$417,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
to
that,
am
i
right
in
going
inference
from
what
you've
just
said
that
until
the
interest
of
the
beneficiaries,
potential
beneficiaries
under
the
delaware
trust
--
under
the
delaware
trust
influence,
are
declared
by
delaware
court
to
the
nonexisting
interest,
that
they
have
potentially,
if
i
may
use
an
old
fashioned
phrase,
have
vested
interest
which
couldn't
be
cut
off.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose,
may
i
--
may
i
break
in.
suppose
the
trust
instrument
had
definitely
designated
the
beneficiary
under
the
trust
agreement
subject
to
the
reserve
power
of
the
--
of
the
trust
--
the
donor
of
the
trust
and
the
power
to
make
any
changes
she
pleases,
nearly,
the
potential
interest
that
if
she
doesn't
make
any
changes,
then
the
designated
beneficiaries
under
that
trust
agreement,
they
have,
as
i
understand
certainly
(inaudible),
they
have
an
interest
which
is
not
defeatable,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
action
of
the
donor
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
default
of
none
--
of
none
exercise
of
the
reserve
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
tell
whether
the
florida
opinion
dealt
with
the
constitutional
question
that
was
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
the
florida
court
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
fact
riley
against
new
york
trust
(inaudible)
