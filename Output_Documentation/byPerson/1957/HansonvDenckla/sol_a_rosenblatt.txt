mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
sir,
we
were
advised
that
the
order
was
(inaudible)
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
we
(inaudible)
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i'd
be
glad
to.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
all
right.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
should
have
some
facts
before
i
get
into
the
discussion
of
the
law.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
about
the
payment
of
any
taxes
by
this
domiciliary
of
florida.
she
paid
them
since
she
became
a
domiciliary
of
florida.
and
under
the
authority
of
graves
against
schmidlapp,
315
united
states,
and
bullen
against
wisconsin,
240
united
states,
florida
has
the
right
and
collected
the
taxes
on
the
exercise
of
a
power
to
dispose
of
intangibles
even
though
the
trust
fund
and
trustee
were
outside
of
the
state.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
657,
sir.
these
two
cases
are
the
only
united
states
supreme
court
cases
which
are
cited
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
making
its
decision
in
a
case
involving
nothing
but
florida
domiciliaries
and
involving
two
trust
companies
both
of
whom
were
mentioned
in
the
will.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
sir,
if
you
want
a
straight
forward
answer
which
you're
entitled
to
for
me
sir,
i
don't
care
what
the
situation
is
in
the
state
of
delaware.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i'm
only
interested
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
understand
that,
sir,
but
we're
talking
of
the
peculiar
intangible
property
tax
which
a
great
number
of
our
states
imposed.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
which
are
imposed
upon
the
substance
of
trust
whether
they're
located
in
the
state
or
elsewhere.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
well
sir,
i
would
like
to
start
from
the
time
that
this
lady
died.
because
when
she
died
on
november
the
20th,
1952
as
a
domiciliary
of
florida,
she
left
a
will
which
had
been
made
on
december
3rd,
1949
and
she
left
executed
on
that
same
day,
december
3rd,
1949
a
so-called
power
of
appointment.
and
thereafter,
another
paper
of
july,
1950,
and
she
says
in
the
original
trust
that
the
disposition
of
that
trust
shall
be
upon
her
death
in
accordance
with
her
last
writing
accepted
by
the
trust
company.
and
her
last
writing
doesn't
even
exercise
the
power
of
appointment.
so
after
she
died,
eight
days
letter
--
later,
mr.
foulk,
who
is
in
these
affidavits,
submitted
to
the
court,
describes
a
general
counsel
for
the
donner
estate.
mr.
foulk
wrote
a
letter
and
he's
telling
some
beneficiaries
on
november
28
at
page
79
of
the
florida
record,
about
this
trust
with
the
wilmington
trust
and
he
says
that
certain
monies
are
to
be
paid
to
this
executrix
after
the
payment
of
the
following
specific
legacies
and
he's
talking
about
legacies
in
describing
the
so-called
remainders
in
the
trust.
i
didn't
use
the
language.
and
thereafter
sir,
this
executrix
and
her
counsel
mr.
foulk
filed
an
inventory
as
required
by
the
florida
law
and
listed
these
assets
of
the
wilmington
trust
company
trust
as
part
and
parcel
of
this
florida
state.
more,
she,
the
executrix
of
florida
domiciliary,
mr.
foulk
her
lawyer
permitted
in
florida
to
represent
her,
both
took
fees
and
commissions
on
that
inventory
which
included
these
assets
even
though
they
were
located
in
the
state
of
delaware.
these
were
the
facts
that
came
before
the
court.our
people
who
are
the
appellees
here
had
a
right
to
rely
upon
that
inventory.
and
when
the
time
was
passing,
and
nothing
was
happening
about
disposing
of
the
estate,
the
appellees
brought
this
suit
in
the
state
of
florida
and
please
let's
not
be
confused
further,
page
12
of
the
record
in
florida
shows
that
the
plaintiffs
pray
one,
that
the
court
construe
and
determine
the
question
of
what
portion
of
the
trust
property
involved
herein
passes
under
the
residuary
clause
of
the
will
of
the
decedent.
why
is
that?
because
in
her
will,
she
said
that
her
florida
state
should
pay
all
the
taxes
even
on
this
trust,
which
he
described
in
delaware.
so
when
this
action
was
commenced,
what
happened
first?
well,
low
and
behold,
mr.
foulk
and
the
executrix
rushed
into
the
court
in
florida,
went
to
pay
back
the
money
and
correct
the
inventory.
up
to
that
time,
they'd
never
done
anything
of
a
kind.
the
florida
court
refused
to
take
back
the
money.
that
procedure
is
stayed
to
this
very
moment.
now
what
did
they
do
next?
everybody
including
these
trust
companies
had
been
cited.
i
said
that
in
her
will
she
gave
directions
to
the
wilmington
trust
company.
it's
mentioned
in
the
will.
i
said
that
under
her
will,
the
delaware
trust
company
which
mr.
foulk
is
the
director
and
head
of
the
trust
committee
by
the
way,
that
delaware
trust
company
is
a
legatee
under
this
will,
and
both
of
those
trust
companies
were
notified
like
all
the
other
parties
by
constructive
service,
mailing
by
the
clerk
to
their
last
known
address
under
the
records
of
florida
statute.
same
as
we
do
in
new
york
or
nebraska
or
any
other
state
in
the
united
states
and
when
we
have
before
us
a
question
relating
to
a
deed
and
estate
or
a
will
of
a
domiciliary
of
our
state.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
we
had
more
than
a
corpus
in
florida,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
these
securities,
no,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
no
sir.
never
was
in
florida.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
litigation
concerned
the
position
of
the
parties
before
the
florida
court,
the
executrix,
and
the
beneficiaries,
and
the
claimants
to
the
fund.
and
that's
why
i
say
to
you,
sir.
i
don't
care
if
they
never
bring
a
cent
from
delaware
to
florida,
the
executrix,
all
of
the
beneficiaries,
the
children
by
her
as
their
guardian
ad
litem
the
beneficiaries
to
these
(inaudible),
all
of
these
parties
are
before
the
florida
court.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
would
not
say
the
same
thing
if
it
was
an
incontestable
trust,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
right,
sir,
because
this
is
an
ambulatory
trust.
this
trust
under
the
law
of
florida,
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
again
and
again.
and
as
late
as
1956,
in
a
case
called
forsythe
against
spielberger
has
held
consistently
just
as
the
courts
in
illinois,
courts
in
georgia,
courts
in
mississippi,
even
the
courts
in
pennsylvania,
that
if
a
trust
is
made
of
this
kind
and
there
are
no
vested
remainders
because
they
can
be
amended
or
changed
from
time
to
time
or
revoked,
no
gift
tax
is
paid
whatsoever,
no
one
has
any
present
interest,
everything
has
to
pass
later,
then
those
are
considered
in
those
states,
in
those
jurisdictions
including
florida
as
testamentary
disposition.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
can
delaware
determine
what
florida
should
but
that's
what
delaware
has
done.
we
don't
care
what
delaware
did.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
but
wouldn't
it
be
a
terrible
thing,
your
honor,
for
delaware
to
be
able
to
say
as
to
what
passes
and
how
the
taxes
are
to
be
apportioned
on
the
estate
of
a
florida
domiciliary
with
a
florida
executrix
and
before
the
florida
court?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
how
could
delaware
do?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
tell
you
what
professor
scott
said.
we
used
to
call
him
scotty
at
43
harvard
law
review,
521,
page
529.
it's
cited
in
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
he
says
in
such
a
case
--
in
such
a
case
there's
authority
to
the
effect
that
the
trust
is
in
substance
testamentary
and
is
invalid
unless
declared
in
an
instrument
executed
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute
of
will.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
no.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
but
the
question
--
well,
you
can
cite
all
of
the
text
writers
bogart,
page
on
wills,
every
text
writer
there
is
but
isn't
this,
your
honor,
a
case
of
determination
by
the
state
which
concerns
itself
with
the
estate
of
his
domiciliary.
they
--
we
have
a
motion
pending
before
this
court.
i
like
to
discuss
that
motion
for
two
minutes.
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
that
they
have
backed
in
apparently,
to
try
to
get
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
they
say,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
appellant's
reply
brief,
the
judgment
appealed
from
rest
on
an
adequate
federal
basis.
they
bottomed
the
appeal
on
three
federal
grounds.
this
is
the
florida
case
which
we
moved
to
dismiss,
(a)
lack
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
due
process
to
who,
your
honors?
not
to
the
executrix,
not
to
the
guardian
ad
litem.
they're
florida
--
floridians.
lack
of
due
process
to
who,
to
the
wilmington
trust
and
the
delaware
trust
who
don't
appear?
your
honors
have
held
again
and
again
that
you
won't
take
any
jurisdiction
of
any
appeal
when
somebody
is
heard
to
complain
about
what
happens
to
third
parties.
that's
the
liberty
warehouse
case
in
276
united
states,
smith
against
indiana,
191
united
states.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
trustees,
your
honor,
were
cited
by
the
florida
court.
choosing
not
to
enter
the
florida
court
does
not
give
the
executrix
the
right
to
object.
the
executrix
is
supposed
to
handle
this
will
and
its
affairs,
the
estate
impartially.
is
she
to
be
heard
to
complain
that
they
weren't
before
the
florida
case
court?
that's
what
she
said
as
her
declaration
which
mr.
foulk
also
filed
in
delaware
that
they
haven't
been
validly
served
in
florida.
what
business
is
it
of
hers,
your
honor?
they
didn't
come
in
here
and
asked
to
have
this
judgment
reviewed
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
they're
not
even
parties
except
that
they
were
served
and
there's
a
decree
against
them
but
they're
not
before
this
court
in
the
florida
case.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
potential
beneficiary,
sir
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
governed
as
floridians,
as
florida
citizens
by
the
law
of
the
state
of
florida
not
by
the
law
of
the
state
of
delaware.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
sir?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
sir,
i
hope
because
the
clerk
arranged
the
order
of
this
argument
that
i'm
not
in
privity,
so
to
speak,
in
all
accounts
with
my
friend
mr.
logan.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
you
bet
your
boots
it
makes
the
difference.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
i
say
it
should
go
according
to
the
way
the
law
of
florida
has
decided.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
well,
i
never
saw
that
much
money.
so,
i'm
very
happy
if
my
clients
get
it.
i
say
that
this
lady
has
no
right
to
back
into
this
court
claiming
lack
of
due
process
against
these
trust
companies.
the
second
ground
is
the
alleged
failure
of
the
florida
courts
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
judgment
in
the
delaware
courts.
if
your
honors
will
take
the
time
which
i'm
sure
you
do
to
read
this
fantastic
decision
of
the
supreme
of
court
delaware,
which
is
cited
as
authority
for
their
having
a
right
to
come
here,
you
will
see
that
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
has
analyzed
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
preceded
it,
and
has
said
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
doesn't
even
know
what
the
law
of
florida
is.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
cited
the
case
which
has
been
very
much
used
in
their
jurisdiction
called
henderson
against
usher,
167.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
says,
“it
doesn't
mean
at
all,”
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
it
meant
although
the
supreme
court
of
florida
decided
the
case.
and
that's
the
way
they
go
all
the
way
through
the
decision.
you
think
that
they
were
sitting
as
an
appellate
court
over
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
third
thing
is
the
failure
to
apply
the
proper
state
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
well,
that's
a
good
ground
that
i
never
heard
of,
because
florida
has
the
right
to
apply
florida
law
to
a
florida
situation.
and
i
don't
think
even
this
court
can
require
that
florida
should
apply
delaware
law
to
a
florida
estate.
it
resolves
itself,
in
my
opinion,
to
a
very
narrow
issue
and
you
can
recall
that
i
take
the
position,
that
if
this
court
in
reviewing
my
motion
to
dismiss
this
case
were
to
hold
that
there
couldn't
be
any
constructive
service
on
the
wilmington
trust
company
or
the
delaware
trust
company,
even
though
they're
mentioned
in
the
will
of
legatee.
if
you
--
you
held
that,
i
say
that
under
pennoyer
against
neff,
i
am
still
entitled
to
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
as
between
all
of
the
floridians.
i
say,
that
that's
binding
between
the
people
who
were
before
the
court.
of
the
innocent
victim
that
was
on
the
wrong
side
in
that
vanderbilt
versus
vanderbilt
case
last
year,
that's
got
nothing
to
do
with
this
at
all.
but
pennoyer
against
neff,
which
does
apply,
certainly
entitles
me
to
say
that
as
between
the
parties
in
florida
who
were
there
and
in
this
case,
that
that
is
a
binding
decree
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
now,
so
far,
i
haven't
asked
to
enforce
that
decree
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
said
again
and
again
that
until
there's
some
real
question
before
it,
it
won't
anticipate.
i
haven't
asked
that
my
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
be
considered
as
something
which
i'm
asking
this
court
to
execute
and
impose
upon
all
the
other
states
yet.
yes,
in
the
brief,
we
said
that
the
dignity
of
the
florida
supreme
court
should
be
upheld
and
that
its
judgement
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
but
i
don't
care,
as
mr.
logan
cares,
that
there
is
a
decision
of
the
delaware
supreme
court,
my
people
were
never
parties
to
the
decision
in
delaware,
the
infants
who
are
beneficiaries,
under
the
so-called
power
of
appointment.
those
beneficiaries
are
represented
by
a
guardian
ad
litem,
their
own
mother
in
the
state
of
florida.
they
didn't
have
to
be,
until
she
and
mr.
foulk
run
up
to
delaware.
she
didn't
--
they
didn't
have
to
have
a
delaware
guardian
ad
litem.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
without
any
question.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
do.
but
i
don't
care
if
you
say
it
wasn't.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
it
was
for
--
on
the
following
basis.
mr.
logan
developed
a
theory
of
nexus
here,
the
acts
of
the
delaware
--
the
wilmington
trust
company
etcetera.
i
say
that
in
view
of
the
provisions
of
the
will
itself,
referring
to
the
wilmington
trust
company
and
in
view
of
the
provisions
making
that
delaware
trust
company
a
legatee,
that
the
state
of
florida
under
its
statute,
which
is
appended
to
our
brief
in
a
declaratory
suit,
has
the
same
right
to
ask
that
those
companies
be
heard
or
forever
keep
their
peace
as
it
has
any
others
interested
in
an
estate.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
cited
a
case
from
new
jersey
on
the
problem.
it
has
also
cited
a
case
where
it
itself
gave
service
to
the
chase
national
bank
which
was
a
trustee
in
new
york,
similar
to
the
wilmington
trust
company
in
delaware.
there
is
authority
within
the
state
of
florida
upholding
its
right
in
this
kind
of
a
declaratory
action
to
cite
in
those
that
it
considers
ought
to
be
before
the
court.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
raise
itself
was
the
will,
the
estate,
the
necessity
for
finding
tax
money,
the
assets
of
this
estate.
that's
the
raise
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
certainly
do.
and
particularly,
your
honor,
have
i
right
to
do
that,
when
the
executrix
before
there
was
any
suit
and
mr.
foulk
who
furnished
the
information
before
there
was
any
suit,
listed
it
as
an
inventory
asset
of
this
estate.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
if
it's
a
valid
trust
and
that
the
wilmington
trust
company
claimed
any
rights.
and
by
the
way,
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
with
the
decision
of
the
state
of
florida
but
i
think
it's
so
well
reasoned
and
the
citations
of
authority
are
so
good
that
it
will
stand
as
one
of
the
great
decisions
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
trust
is
really
a
trust
or
an
agency
agreement.
but
answering
your
question,
where
was
the
wilmington
trust
company
had
notice
and
the
delaware
trust
company
who
was
a
legatee?
where
were
they?
they
were
waiting
to
see
if
they
could
get
the
thing
dismissed
in
florida
and
then
waiting
that
the
executrix
would
run
to
delaware
and
arrange
to
lose
a
case.
that's
where
they
were
and
that's
where
they
are
now.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
no.
if
the
executrix
who
was
there
stooge
could
get
the
case
dismissed.
they
could
have
come
in
your
honor.
they
could
have
raised
all
these
points.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
don't
think
so
according
to
the
law
of
florida.
and
i
wish
your
honors
to
please
consider
very
carefully
the
alleged
basis
for
jurisdiction
from
the
florida
judgment.
i
think
i
made
it
clear
and
i'm
saying
it
now
for
the
fourth
time
that
i'm
not
at
all
interested
in
the
decision
from
delaware.
it's
my
duty
and
my
burden
here
which
i
hope
i've
discharged
to
show
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court
to
hear
the
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
no
certiorari
has
been
granted
here.
they
just
raised
these
points
for
the
first
time
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
after
the
supreme
court
of
florida
decided
its
case.
these
alleged
grounds
are
for
the
first
time
brought
to
the
state
of
florida
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
after
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
and
i've
cited
plenty
of
authority
that
they
can't
back
in
on
that
basis
either.
now,
may
it
please
this
court.
i
think
that
there
is
one
thing
that
ought
to
be
made
clear.
there
has
been
great
comment
by
text
writers,
newspaper
personnel,
strangers,
those
not
members
of
the
bar,
who
are
constantly
complaining
that
this
court
that
takes
itself
into
considerations
of
state
law
so
that
there
is
no
grounding
for
the
alleged
federal
questions.
i
have
emphasized
my
position
because
timely,
we
move
to
dismiss
this
appeal
which
had
been
taken
in
my
opinion
without
any
warrant
or
without
any
authority,
and
on
the
basis
of
points
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
i
asked
that
this
court
consider
the
florida
case
per
se.
i
ask
that
the
court
read
the
florida
judgement
as
springing
from
the
holdings
long
established
of
florida
law.
i
ask
that
the
court
consider
that
whether
this
judgement
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
sought
to
be
enforced
otherwise
or
elsewhere
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
the
right
to
make
its
decision.
and
that
it
has
like
all
the
other
states
the
right
to
supervise
and
oversee
the
acts,
the
deeds,
the
wills,
and
the
estates
of
its
domiciliaries.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
held
that
on
an
inter
vivos
trust
where
no
present
interest
have
been
given,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
says
that
there
is
a
republication
of
the
so-called
trust
instrument
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
amend
it
after
a
person
has
become
a
resident
of
florida.
in
1949,
the
trust
having
originated
in
1935
and
had
been
amended
theretofore
twice.
in
1949
sir,
there
was
one
so-called
exercise
of
the
power
of
appointment.
and
in
july
1950,
and
i
ask
you
please
to
see
what
this
last
writing
contains
because
it
certainly
is
not
an
exercise
of
any
power
of
appointment.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
but
in
1950,
there
was
another
one.
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
says,
“just
the
same
as
other
states
that
when
those
amendments
were
made,
that
constituted
really
a
republication
of
the
original
so-called
trust
document
by
its
domiciliary.”
and
they
say
that
in
accordance
with
long
held
florida
law
that
when
that
was
republished,
for
example
the
last
paper
writing
being
in
1950,
it
had
to
be
executed
with
the
same
solemnity
as
any
testamentary
instrument.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
now
has
the
florida
court
the
right
to
say
how
a
testamentary
disposition
is
to
be
executed?
every
state
makes
certain
provisions
about
them.
i
don't
know
what
the
law
would
be
in
new
york
or
some
of
the
other
states
as
to
an
ambulatory
instrument
like
this,
whether
you
would
call
it
a
trust
or
an
agency,
i
don't
care.
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
i
think,
a
very
apt
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
which
says,
that
when
an
instrument
in
form
of
deeds,
specifically
provides
that
it
shall
not
take
effect
until
the
death
of
the
grantor,
it
is
testamentary
in
character
and
void
as
a
deed.
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
so
declared,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
the
right
to
similarly
declare
as
it
did.
when
it
said
a
deed
in
order
to
be
effective
as
such
must
pass
a
present
interest
to
the
grantee,
although
grantee's
right
to
enter
into
possession
may
be
deferred
to
a
future
time.
and
if
the
deed
manifested
intention
that
it
shall
be
operative
only
upon
the
grantor's
death,
it
can
never
take
effect
at
all
unless
executed
with
such
formality
that
it
maybe
given
effect
as
a
testamentary
disposition.
and
i
say
that
not
even
this
august
court
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
the
right
to
overthrow
the
long
established
law
of
the
state
of
florida
over
its
own
domiciliary.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
right.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
can
only
cite
the
record
itself.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
do
sir.
and
the
record
will
speak
for
itself.
