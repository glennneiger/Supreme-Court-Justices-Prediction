which

it
under

of
what

is
much
to
decide.

you're
talking
about
on
your
case
but
in
the
florida
case
i'd
suppose
that
if
the
court
had
been
reckless,
it
should
be
decided
which
assuming
that
all
the
parties
were
there
properly,
it
should
be
decided
and
have
to
be
decided,
which
state
law
governs
would
it
not
as
to
the
construction
of
the
trust.
