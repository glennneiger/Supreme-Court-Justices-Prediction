mr.
william
h.
foulk
if
your
honors
please.
this
case
originated
in
the
circuit
court
of
palm
beach
county,
florida.
it
was
brought
by
katherine
denckla
and
elwyn
middleton
as
guardian
for
katherine
denckla's
sister,
dorothy
stewart,
for
the
purpose
stated
in
the
complaint
of
determining
what
passed
under
their
mother's
will.
the
respondents
in
the
case
were
their
half-sister,
mrs.
hanson,
individually
as
executrix
of
her
mother's
will
and
as
guardian
ad
litem
for
her
two
--
two
of
her
four
children.
the
third
child
of
william
donner
roosevelt
was
also
joined
as
a
respondent.
the
complaint
also
joined
the
wilmington
trust
company
as
trustee
under
a
trust
created
by
mrs.
donner
in
january
--
in
march
of
1935
and
the
delaware
trust
company
which
was
the
named
trustee
for
the
two
minor
children
of
mrs.
hanson
in
two
trusts
which
were
appointed
$200,000
each
under
a
power
of
appointment
under
the
trust
of
which
wilmington
trust
company
was
trustee
in
the
1935
trust.
the
--
there
were
also
two
servants
of
mrs.
donner
who
was
appointed
under
the
1935
trust
to
point
--
named
as
respondents.
three
other
servants
who
were
appointees
under
that
trust,
were
not
named
and
were
not
--
not
joined
as
a
suit
--
in
the
suit.
all
of
the
respondents
other
than
mrs.
hanson
and
their
three
children
were
nonresidents
of
the
state
of
florida.
they
were
not
served
and
they
did
not
appear
in
the
proceedings.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
that
the
powers
of
appointment
under
the
1935
trust
were
invalid
and
that
they
had
jurisdiction
over
the
non-appearing
respondents
and
it's
from
that
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
we
have
appealed.
your
honors
postponed
the
decision
on
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
until
this
hearing
and
consolidated
the
proceeding
with
--
a
proceeding
which
--
on
which
you
granted
writ
of
certiorari
to
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
held
that
the
same
trust
which
florida
supreme
court
had
found
to
be
invalid
was
valid,
so
that
as
--
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
delaware
said,
“we
have
a
headlong
collision
between
the
two
states.”
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
are
not
disputed.
mrs.
donner
executed
this
trust
when
she
was
a
resident
of
pennsylvania
in
1935.
it
was
consummated
in
wilmington,
delaware
where
the
offices
of
the
wilmington
trust
company
are
and
the
securities
which
became
the
corpus
of
the
trust
were
delivered
to
the
wilmington
trust
company
in
wilmington
delaware
and
have
remained
there
at
all
times
during
the
continuance
of
the
trust.
in
that
trust,
she
--
which
was
fully
revocable,
she
reserved
to
herself
the
right
to
appoint
the
property
by
last
instrument
in
writing
delivered
to
the
trustee
or
failing
such
instrument
by
her
last
will
and
testament
or
failing
either
to
her
issue
was
gift
over
to
her
next
kin
of
no
issue.
three
months
after
she
executed
the
trust,
she
appointed
the
property
to
various
persons
and
after
she
had
appointed
--
several
years
after
she
had
appointed
--
made
that
power
of
appointment,
she
changed
her
domicile
to
florida.
she
died
domicile
in
florida
in
november
of
1952.
prior
to
that
time,
she
had
made
a
further
power
of
appointment
in
december
of
1949,
in
which
she
appointed
mrs.
hanson's
two
younger
children
or
the
trustees
in
delaware
trust
company
of
two
trust
which
mrs.
hanson
had
created
for
those
children
to
$200,000
each
of
the
trust
property,
$10,000
to
the
bryn
mawr
hospital
of
bryn
mawr,
pennsylvania
and
$7000
deprived
service.
on
the
same
day,
she
--
the
balance
of
the
trust
fund
which
she
appointed
to
her
executrix
under
her
will.
on
the
same
day,
she
drew
her
will
and
in
that
will,
she
disposed
of
all
of
her
residuary
estate
including
any
property
subject
to
a
power
of
appointment
which
had
not
been
effectively
exercised
in
our
lifetime
to
her
executrix
with
instructions
to
pay
any
estate
inheritance
or
other
death
of
succession
taxes
due
by
reason
of
the
appointments
which
he
had
made
under
the
1935
trust
and
to
divide
the
remainder
of
the
residuary
between
delaware
trust
company
as
trustee
under
a
trust
for
mrs.
denckla
and
between
a
trust
created
by
the
will
of
which
mrs.
hanson
was
trustee.
the
1935
trust
provided
that
the
wilmington
trust
company
should
have
invested
funds
and
--
and
pay
the
income
to
mrs.
donner
for
her
life.
the
investment,
however,
by
the
terms
of
the
trust
were
to
be
directed
by
an
adviser
of
the
trust.
mr.
donner
was
the
adviser
of
the
trust.
he
originally
made
the
investments
until
he
was
replaced
by
the
members
of
the
office
staff
of
the
donner
family
which
was
later
incorporated
in
the
donner
estates
and
acted
as
investment
council
to
the
trust.
mrs.
donner
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
management
of
the
property.
she
did
have
the
right
to
change
the
trustee
though
and
she
had
the
right
to
change
the
advisers
and
as
i've
just
said,
she
did
change
those
advisers
from
time
to
time.
after
her
death,
her
will
was
probated
in
long
beach
county
and
mrs.
hanson
was
--
who
was
named
the
executrix
in
the
will,
was
appointed
and
qualified
as
the
executrix.
some
time
after
that,
the
wilmington
trust
company
paid
out
of
the
trust
fund,
the
$417,000
which
have
been
appointed
to
the
delaware
trust
company
as
trustee
under
the
two-trust
for
the
sons
and
to
the
other
beneficiaries.
more
than
14
months
after
the
distribution
had
been
made
and
after
the
estate
have
been
practically
fully
administered,
this
suit
was
commenced.
the
--
neither
the
trustee
or
--
nor
the
executrix
had
any
--
had
heard
any
charge
of
invalidity
or
suspected
that
there
was
any
--
would
be
any
attack
on
the
trust
or
on
the
powers
of
appointment
up
until
the
time
of
the
filing
of
this
suit.
as
i
said,
the
--
the
announced
purpose
of
the
suit
is
to
determine
what
pass
--
passes
under
the
will
of
florida
domiciliary.
the
real
crux
of
the
case
though
is
the
determination
of
a
delaware
trust.
as
soon
as
the
suit
was
filed
representing
the
respondents
who
had
been
served
mrs.
hanson
are
the
three
children.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
trust
res
was
in
delaware
that
the
trustee
was
in
delaware.
the
appointees
were
all
nonresidents
of
florida
and
that
therefore,
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
was
absent
raised
and
indispensable
parties
defended.
the
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
if
your
honors
please.
at
adjournment
yesterday,
i
had
said
that
the
appellant's
first
pleading
in
the
trial
court
in
florida
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
the
florida
court
like
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
which
was
the
1935
trust,
and
of
the
trustee
and
the
appointees
of
the
property
of
that
trust
who
were
nonresident
parties.
the
trial
court
heard
that
motion
and
properly
found
as
we
thought,
though
this
case
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
valid
--
validity
and
effect
of
certain
powers
of
appointment
rather
than
a
will,
recognizing
our
position
right
there.
he
went
on
to
hold
that
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
matter
sought
to
be
presented
by
this
motion
can
best
be
determined
at
the
final
hearing.
we
weren't
satisfied
with
that
and
we
petitioned
the
supreme
court
of
florida
for
certiorari
on
the
ground
that
the
trial
court
had
no
jurisdiction
and
that
the
parties
should
not
be
put
to
the
expense
of
a
final
hearing
if
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
heard
us
but
deny
our
petition.
the
executrix
send
and
pleaded
all
of
the
parties
in
--
an
action
in
the
court
of
chancery
in
the
state
of
delaware,
which,
as
your
honors
will
recall,
had
the
raise
in
its
state
and
had
control
over
the
wilmington
trust
company
as
trustee
of
the
1935
trust.
having
--
she
brought
that
suit
for
two
valid
reasons.
one,
because
she
wanted
to
expedite
the
settlement
of
the
state
and
two,
she
had
been
charged
in
the
florida
proceedings
with
a
failure
to
capture
assets
and
therefore
a
dereliction
in
her
duty
as
executrix.
having
brought
that
suit
in
delaware,
she
came
back
and
filed
her
answer
or
the
appellants
joined
with
her
in
filing
an
answer
in
which
she
said
to
the
court,
“now,
the
delaware
law
applies
to
this
trust.
it's
a
trust
that
has
its
home
in
delaware.
and
we
are
filing
with
this
complaint
a
copy
of
our
complaint
or
with
this
answer,
a
copy
our
complaint
in
delaware
and
we're
again
raising
in
this
answer
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
your
court.”
at
the
same
time,
the
appellants
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
florida
action
pending
the
determination
of
the
validity
of
the
trust
in
delaware.
the
respondents
or
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lower
court,
the
appellees
here
immediately
filed
a
--
an
application
for
an
injunction
against
the
executrix
pursuing
the
suit
in
delaware.
it
was
a
rather
meaningless
gesture
because
she
had
merely
acted
as
an
inner
pleader
in
the
delaware
proceeding
and
asked
the
court
to
decide
who
was
entitled
to
her
mother's
property
in
this
trust,
whether
or
not
her
stepsisters
or
half
sisters
got
property
under
the
will
or
her
children
got
$470
--
$400,000
and
the
other
appointees,
$17,000.
surprising
it
may
seem
in
that
application
for
an
injunction,
the
plaintiff
said
that
the
circuit
court
had
already
decided
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
that
the
executrix
was
guilty
of
bad
faith
in
going
to
delaware
and
filing
this
action
to
do
just
what
they
charged
then
with
not
doing,
and
they
went
on
to
charge
that
she
was
trying
to
lose
the
case
in
delaware
to
benefit
her
children.
the
court
--
another
judge
then
the
trial
judge
who
had
heard
the
motion
to
dismiss,
granted
the
injunction.
thereafter,
both
of
the
parties
filed
motions
for
summary
decree
or
summary
judgement
in
the
trial
court
in
palm
beach,
and
that
hope,
i
neglected
to
say,
we
again
appeal
or
petition
the,
so
far
as
the
supreme
court
from
certiorari
from
the
denial
of
the
trial
court
to
grant
our
petition
to
stay
and
from
its
grant
of
the
injunction
against
the
executrix
going
forward
in
delaware.
that
was
denied.
then
we
--
both
parties
filed
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
and
the
case
was
argued
before
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
court
found
that
as
to
jurisdiction,
the
trust
assets
and
the
trustee
in
delaware,
no
personal
service
has
been
handed
upon
the
defendants
who
have
failed
to
answer.
therefore,
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
case
as
to
the
wilmington
trust
company
trustee
and
as
to
the
persons
who
were
appointed
to
the
$417,000
under
the
power
--
powers
of
appointment.
but
it
went
on
to
say
that
as
to
the
answering
defendants,
the
executrix
and
her
three
children
that
the
court
was
going
to
decide,
determined
that
this
trust
agreement
of
1935
was
testamentary
in
character
and
not
having
met
the
requirements
of
the
statute
of
wills,
it
was
valid,
and
therefore
all
of
the
property,
the
$417,000
plus
the
remaining
million
dollars
that
went
to
the
executrix
under
the
power,
anyway,
passed
under
the
will
to
the
--
the
beneficiaries
of
the
will
rather
than
the
trust.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
she
had
filed
an
accounting
and
exceptions
had
been
filed
to
that
accounting.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
her
final
accounting
as
executrix.
that
was
in
the
county
judges
court
which
is
a
different
court
from
the
circuit
court.
and
those
exceptions
are
still
pending,
awaiting
the
determination
of
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
no.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
this
was
simply
a
suit
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
determining
what
passed
under
the
will
of
a
florida
domiciliary.
we
claim
that
the
will
was
crystal
clear
and
needed
no
determination
that
the
whole
crux
and
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
a
delaware
trust.
we
asked
for
a
rehearing
from
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
that
the
trial
court
had
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
indispensable
parties
and
it
could
enter
a
final
force
--
enforceable
decree
because
the
indispensable
parties
were
not
there,
that
motion
was
denied
without
argument.
we
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
two
bases.one,
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
because
of
the
absence
of
the
trust
res
and
indispensable
parties
including
the
trustees
and
the
appointees,
and
two,
that
they
were
wrong
in
--
that
they
had
not
applied
delaware
law
and
that
they
were
wrong
in
the
law
that
they
did
apply
which
presumably
was
--
was
florida
law.
in
the
meantime,
the
delaware
case
had
proceeded
and
before
we
got
to
the
argument
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
delaware
chancery
--
chancellor,
ruled
that
he
was
not
bind
down
by
the
decision
of
the
florida
trial
court
and
that
the
trust
was
a
delaware
trust
and
under
delaware
law
it
was
valid.
we
filed
a
petition
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
remand
and
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
the
florida
or
the
delaware
chancellor's
decision
and
again
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
delaware
was
the
only
jurisdiction
which
had
the
right
to
declare
the
validity
of
this
trust
and
it
is
spoken
in
--
it
was
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
and
res
judicata.
that
motion
was
heard
at
the
same
time
appearing
on
the
appeal.
and
in
its
judgment,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
found
--
dismissed
that
petition
to
remand
and
determine
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
all
parties
because
this
was
in
reality
the
construction
or
the
determination
of
what
passed
under
a
will.
and
it
went
on
to
--
to
find
that
the
lower
court
is
right
in
finding
that
this
was
a
testamentary
disposition
and
it
added
to
that
that
it
was
a
mere
--
that
the
trust
was
a
mere
agency
agreement
and
therefore,
no
rights
passed
under
the
power
of
appointment,
and
that
was
true
under
delaware
law.
it
specifically
rejected
the
application
of
delaware
law.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
no
--
no
it
was
in
florida
ever.
mrs.
donner,
to
go
back
to
the
facts
that
we
got
yesterday,
was
a
resident
of
pennsylvania
in
1935
when
she
created
this
trust
and
the
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
she
died
in
florida
in
1952
after
moving
there
in
1944.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
it
might
perhaps,
if
your
honor
please
because
there,
it
would
perhaps
come
up
under
an
administrative
function
of
the
florida
court
and
not
under
the
guise
of
determining
what
passed
under
the
crystal
clear
will.
so
that
i
--
i
think
that
that
distinction
might
be
well
taken.
now,
we
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
florida
court
and
we
raised
every
question
we
could
think
of
that
we
raised
up
until
then
lack
of
jurisdiction
full
faith
and
credit
failure
to
grant
due
process
in
applying
the
applicable
or
the
proper
choice
of
law
and
that
was
denied
without
argument.
then
before
the
time
run
out
for
the
appeal
to
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
sustained
the
chancellor
in
delaware
and
found
that
--
that
was
not
stopped
by
reason
of
the
florida
court's
decision
and
that
the
trust
was
a
valid
delaware
trust
and
it
had
the
right
to
determine
the
policy
of
the
state
of
delaware
on
the
press
that
existed
in
its
state.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
some
of
the
parties
were
not
before
the
florida
court.
we
of
course
claim
that
indispensable
parties
were
not
before
the
florida
court
because
no
proper
service
had
been
had
on
them
because
of
the
absence
of
any
property
of
theirs
in
the
state
or
because
of
their
personal
presence
there.
florida
attempted
to
serve
them
under
a
statute
which
gives
them
the
right
to
determine
matters
of
wills.
now
this
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
that's
right.
and
that
--
that
the
will
had
already
been
probated
and
it
--
it
was
--
the
estate
was
practically
administered
when
this
started.
this
suit
started
14
moths
after
the
--
the
death
of
mrs.
donner
and
our
position
is
always
been,
that
this
is
a
plain
out
of
action
to
construe
or
determine
the
valid
--
the
validity
of
a
delaware
trust
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
and
the
will
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
it
and
the
statute
is
used
just
as
a
--
as
an
implement
to
get
florida's
jurisdiction
over
these
assets.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
that's
--
that's
their
position
that
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
now
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
that
is
right.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
well,
that's
one
of
the
issues.
then
we
didn't
--
we
say
that
florida,
assuming
that
they
had
jurisdiction,
must
apply
delaware
law
because
it's
a
delaware
trust,
the
assets
are
in
delaware.
and
we
say
that
in
denial
of
the
choice
of
delaware
law,
it
violated
due
process
under
the
home
insurance
company
versus
dick
and
hartford
accident
&
indemnity
cases
versus
delta
&
pine
land
company.
then
of
course,
we
say
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
but
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
well
that's
--
that's
the
way
they
have
it.
we
of
course
dispute
that.
i
think
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
well,
we
--
mr.
william
h.
foulk
well,
we
say
of
course,
that
there
was
no
need
to
determine
what
passed
under
this
will
that
everything
passed
under
the
will
that
she
hadn't
disposed
of
in
her
lifetime
and
that
under
the
law
of
delaware,
which
was
the
side
and
home
of
this
trust,
she
had
made
a
valid
disposition
of
this
property.
so,
there
wasn't
anything
left
for
florida
to
--
to
determine,
but
in
determining
what
passed
under
their
will,
they
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
trust
which
has
its
home
in
(inaudible)
in
delaware
was
valid
under
delaware
law.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
the
trustees
were
there.
mr.
william
h.
foulk
that's
correct.
yes.
thank
you.
