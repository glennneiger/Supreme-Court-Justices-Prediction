construe
what
that

mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
rely
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
reason
we
should
have
it
to
see
what's
in
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
those
had
--
if
he
had
obtain
that,
would
that
have
been
adequate
to
let
the
supreme
court
act
on
the
assignments
of
error
he
made?
justice

black
do
the
--
are
the
statements
made
of
this
page

on
the
brief
of
counsel
correct
as
to
the
grounds
for
appeal
that
were
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
could
those
have
been
passed
on
by
the
supreme

is
that
a
proper
assignment

it
without
the
question.

in

they're
wrong
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
have
to
be,
if
they
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
verdict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
it
has
not
yet
been
determined.
i
assume
that
there
--
there
is
no
statute
which
authorizes
that
narrative
you're
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
bystander's

as

as
the
court
held
(inaudible)
as
that
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
should
be
determined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
issue
has
been
determined
that
this
particular
defendant
is
competent
and
able
to
have
prepared
a

for
himself.
