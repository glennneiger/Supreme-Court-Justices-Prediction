j.
brennan,

now,
when
was
that
requested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
that
requested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
question
of
the
availability
of
the
transcript
that's
only
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
has
the
state
ever
taken
the
position
that
they're
not
available
or
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
all
that
you're
asking
for
is
that
the
--
vacate
what
happened
in
the
federal
court
below
and
give
you
an
opportunity
whatever
may
be
the
requirements
for
the
purpose
under
washington
law,
the
effect
can
appeal
to
the
washington
state
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
is
not
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
your
--
what
you're
asking
for
doesn't
require
us
to
determine
how
much
you're
entitled
to
it's
whatever
you're
entitled
to
under
washington
law
to
protect
that
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
direction
of
mr.
justice
black.
i
thought
you
said
that
the
assignment,
that
the
verdict
was
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
could
not
be
determined
without
either
the
full
transcript
of
the
proceeded
--
proceedings
at
the
trial
or
at
least
the
full
narrative
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
would
either
of
those
be
included
in
the
bill
of
exceptions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
could
he
do
that
without
having
to
use
a
transcript
before
from
which
he
could
take
off
the
narrative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
his
own
notes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
that
he
took
it
--
he
took
a
timely
appeal.
