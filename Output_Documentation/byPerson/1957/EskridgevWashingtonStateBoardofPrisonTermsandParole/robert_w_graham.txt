mr.
robert
w.
graham
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
w.
graham
--
and
members
of
the
court.
the
question
presented
to
the
court
on
this
review
is,
i
think,
simply
stated,
while
this
petitioner
who
was
a
pauper,
an
indigent
person
denied
adequate
and
effective
appellate
review
under
the
rule
of
this
case
in
griffin
versus
illinois
by
the
state
of
washington
because
of
his
poverty
in
that
first,
he
was
denied
a
statement
of
facts
whether
that
statement
of
facts
be
in
the
form
of
a
stenographic
transcript
or
otherwise.
and
secondly,
in
that
he
was
not
afforded
the
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal.
in
brief
statement,
the
facts
before
this
court
are
as
follows.
the
action
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
denying
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
sought
by
this
petitioner.
under
the
record,
an
information
was
filed
back
in
1935.
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
murder
in
the
first
degree.
he
was
represented
by
appointed
counsel
in
the
trial
court,
was
appointed
on
october
17th.
a
trial
of
some
nine
days
began
on
november
4th.
the
judgment
and
sentence
following
a
verdict
of
conviction
was
entered
on
december
14th,
and
two
days
later
on
the
16th
of
december,
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
washington
state
penitentiary.
there,
while
in
the
prison
and
without
the
benefit
of
counsel,
he
sought
by
correspondence
and
subsequent
motion
filed
with
the
trial
judge
a
“transcript
of
all
the
records”
in
his
case
and
in
other
references
that
was
designated
as
a
transcript
to
the
evidence
--
a
transcript
to
the
trial
proceedings.
the
state
represented
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
trial
judge
treated
the
application
or
request
as
an
application
for
a
statement
of
facts,
which
is
a
term
of
art
incorporated
to
the
washington
procedural
rule
in
statutes.
the
petitioner
sought
the
transcript
of
records
or
stenographic
transcript
or
statement
of
facts,
whatever
you
please
to
call
it,
under
the
provisions
of
a
washington
state
statute
establishing
our
official
court
recorder
of
system
under
the
terms
of
which
to
an
indigent
defendant,
the
transcript
or
stenographic
transcript
of
the
trial
record
which
is
made
by
the
official
court
recorder,
may
be
furnished
at
county
expense
to
the
indigent
defendant
if
in
the
mind
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge,
the
“ends
of
justice”
will
be
served.
the
application
was
resisted
by
the
county
attorney
who
went
to
the
point
of
securing
an
affidavit
from
the
previously
appointed
trial
counsel.
the
application
was
denied
by
the
trial
judge
who
concluded
that
the
ends
of
justice
would
not
be
served
by
the
furnishing
of
the
transcript.
and
thereafter
and
within
the
time
for
appeal,
the
petitioner
sought
a
writ
of
mandate
in
the
washington
state
supreme
court
requesting
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
be
directed
to
compel
the
trial
judge
to
furnish
the
transcript
as
requested.
now,
in
his
application,
the
petitioner's
application
for
this
writ
of
mandate,
he
asserted
trial
errors
which
are
outlined
in
the
brief
of
petitioner
at
pages
22
and
23
which
on
--
i
shall
not
state,
they
were
errors,
suffice
to
say
which
could
not
be
resolved,
save
and
except
by
a
review
of
the
entire
trial
proceedings.
they
were
not
errors
appearing
on
the
so-called
clerk's
record
which
would
consist
simply
of
the
docket
entries
for
the
papers
of
record.
the
state
made
and
does
make
no
assertion
that
the
appeal
was
prosecuted
other
than
in
complete
good
faith
nor
is
there
any
contention
that
this
is
a
frivolous
appeal
or
that
the
petitioner
sought
a
frivolous
appeal.
furthermore,
i
think,
they're
appropriate
to
point
out
that
before
the
trial
court,
the
state
did
not
contend
that
the
complete
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings
in
stenographic
form
or
otherwise
was
unnecessary
to
the
review
by
the
washington
state
supreme
court
of
the
judgment
of
conviction.
there
was
adequate
showing
made
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
as
to
the
indigence
of
the
defendant
and
he
endeavored
in
both
the
application
for
writ
of
mandate
and
in
his
application
for
the
free
transcript
to
proceed
without
the
benefit
of
counsel.
there
is
no
waiver
of
the
right
of
counsel
on
appeal
in
the
record.
he
did
advise
the
trial
court
that
he
would
proceed
pro
se,
as
he
indicated.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
yes,
sir.
he
gave
oral
notice
of
appeal
which
under
our
procedure,
he's
conformed
to
our
statutory
procedure.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
oral
notice
of
appeal
given
in
open
court
at
the
time
of
the
imposition
of
--
of
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
yes,
sir.
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
that.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
the
short
answer
to
that,
sir,
is
that
this
petition
or
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
following
the
griffin
case,
and
those
are
the
issues
that
we
seek
here
to
elaborate
upon.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
is
correct,
sir.
it
is
a
post-griffin
case,
however,
i
think
it
appropriate
to
point
out
that
it
does
not
reach
--
one
of
the
questions
that
was
raised
in
one
of
the
four
opinions
in
griffin
of
the
plaintiff
so-called
“sleeping”
on
his
rights
in
that
he
did
endeavor
in
the
trial
court
to
get
free
transcript
and
he
endeavored
to
get
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
to
direct
it
to
him.he
sought,
as
i
indicated,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
below
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
denied
his
application
for
writ
without
opinion.
unfortunately,
that
perhaps
is
in
violation
of
the
washington
statutes
but
i
think
that's
of
no
concern
to
us
here.
i
would
point
out
that
in
his
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
while
he
did
not
specifically
request
the
trial
court
nor
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
to
furnish
him
counsel
on
appeal,
he
did
assert
in
his
application
for
writ
that
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
right
of
counsel
and
he
certainly
did
not
waive
any
such
known
constitutional
right
if
such
be
declared.
now,
presumably,
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
to
in
effect
review
and
determine
the
scope
of
the
griffin
case
as
applied
to
procedure
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
and
i
think
inherent
in
that
fourth
one
which
the
court
read,
the
whole
question
as
to
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict
which
is
treated
in
the
decisions
noted
on
pages
22
and
23
of
the
brief.
i
think
there
is
no
question
as
between
the
respondent
here
and
ourselves
as
to
the
requirement
that
insofar
as
those
assertions
of
error
are
concerned,
they
cannot
be
reviewed
upon
the
so-called
clerk's
record.
they
--
mr.
robert
w.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
i
--
i
think
there's
no
issue
raised
on
that
in
brief
so,
i
cannot,
of
course,
speak
for
the
state,
but
there
has
been
no
issue
asserted
as
to
that,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
would
point
out
that
even
the
question
as
to
whether
an
information
is
duplicitous
or
not
is
one
which
cannot
be
raised,
save
and
except
by
the
filing
of
a
statement
of
--
of
facts.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
--
perhaps
i
should
indicate
to
the
court
that
in
terms
of
a
statement
of
facts,
which
is
somewhat
of
term
of
art,
the
statement
of
facts
or
formerly
have
to
do
with
criminal
law,
the
bill
of
exceptions
must
have
been
such
as
to
encompass
all
of
the
matters
intended
to
be
raised
on
the
appeal.
suffice
it
to
say
at
this
point,
that
the
clerk's
record
which
under
our
then
statute
was
required
to
be
furnished
to
him
free
of
charge
but
which
was
not
--
was
not
adequate
to
raise
these
errors
which
he
asserted.
now,
i
point
out
that
the
petitioner
requested
the
so-called
--
the
transcript
of
the
entire
trial
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
graham
in
his
application
to
the
trial
judge,
sir,
at
--
in
1935,
in
december
of
1935,
it
was
repeated
in
the
application
for
the
writ
of
mandate
the
following
february,
if
i
recall
the,
rather
january
when
the
application
for
it
was
filed.
so
therefore,
he
requested
a
clerk's
record
under
our
statute,
he
was
supposed
to
get
that
free
of
charge
but
even
that
wasn't
furnished
him.
he
was
denied
a
"statement
of
facts"
i
inserted
it.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
the
clerk's
record,
sir,
consists
under
our
practice
of
the
--
the
docket
entries,
the
papers
filed,
it
does
not
consist
of
the
proceedings
before
the
trial
judge,
it
does
not
consist
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
but
--
but
those
errors
i
point
out,
the
--
for
example,
the
refusal
to
grant
the
continuance
for
trial
preparation
is
not
a
matter
under
our
court
decisions
which
can
be
reviewed
on
a
clerk's
record.
the
fact
that
affidavits
are
in
the
--
physically
in
the
file
does
not
entitle
the
supreme
court
of
our
jurisdiction
to
review
those
matters
unless
they
have
become
a
part
of
a
statement
of
facts
or
bill
of
exceptions
certified
by
the
trial
judge
as
including
all
of
the
matters
before
him.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
narrate
the
contents
of
those
items,
sir,
and
all
of
the
proceedings
per
chance
that
took
place
with
respect
to
them.
all
of
the
matters
of
hearing,
motions,
affidavits
or
testimony.
the
statement
of
facts
under
our
procedure
is
--
and
may
i
inquire
are
we
proceeding
past
4:30?
mr.
robert
w.
graham
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
the
statement
of
facts
which
he
requested
would
normally
encompass
the
bill
of
exceptions
of
the
entire
trial
proceedings.he
was
denied
not
only
the
clerk's
record
as
i
say,
but
was
denied
of
the
transcript
or
stenographic
proceedings
and
so
forth.
now,
under
our
statutes,
there
is
--
it
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
that
the
statement
of
facts
be
filed.
griffin
rules,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
the
statement
of
facts
may
be
something
less
than
the
total
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
the
trial.
the
question
is
not
before
this
court
as
to
how
much
less
might
have
sufficed
in
terms
of
all
of
the
errors
asserted
nor
does
it
reach
the
question
as
to
how
anything
less
than
the
total
stenographic
transcript
may
be
arrived
at.
the
superior
court
judges
association
of
our
state
in
the
report
which
i
have
appended
as
an
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
suggest
various
methods
of
answering
those
questions,
as
to
how
much
less
than
a
total
stenographic
transcript
may
be
used
to
satisfy
griffin.
it
also
suggests
procedures
as
to
how
that
decision
may
be
arrived
at.
i
submit
that
those
questions
are
not
here
before
the
court.the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
trial
court
and
the
judge
in
the
court
below
assumed
that
the
entire
transcript
of
proceedings
was
necessary
to
the
prosecution
of
this
petitioner's
appeal.
there
was
no
question
in
the
trial
court
as
to
that.
it
was
assumed
that
without
the
so-called
statement
of
facts
or
the
so-called
transcript
of
trial
proceedings
that
he
did
not
have
a
right
to
appeal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
trial
judge
and
the
prosecutor
treated
the
appeal
as
a
discretion
or
as
a
discretionary
matter.
now,
i'd
like
to
advert,
if
i
might,
to
the
question
which
is
post
by
the
last
question
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
stenographic
transcript
was
so-called
necessary
within
the
rule
of
the
griffin
case.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
state
here
for
the
first
time,
now
contends
that
something
less
than
the
entire
transcript
of
proceedings
would
suffice
pointing
out
that
under
the
procedure
of
washington
law
in
earlier
statement,
may
be
used
in
place
of
the
entire
transcript
of
proceedings.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
decisions
of
the
washington
supreme
court
indicate
that
an
appellant
cannot
be
required
to
file
an
entire
stenographic
transcript
of
the
record.
there
is
no
question
as
to
that.
i
would
point
out
with
respect
to
the
same
issue
raised
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
griffin
case
that
neither
in
washington
nor
in
illinois
was
the
filing
of
a
complete
stenographic
transcript
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
get
in
to
the
supreme
court.
both
here
and
in
griffin
the
petitioner
alleged
that
it
was
"necessary"
or
it
was
needed.
this
court
assumed
in
view
of
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
in
argument,
that
while
it
was
available
in
illinois,
nobody
used
it.
this
court
assumed
that
it
was
needed
or
necessary.
that
issue
has
been
controverted
here
in
that
the
state
has
filed
and
it
refers
to
the
application
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
in
the
petition
on
certiorari
has
--
has
in
effect
denied
that
that
was
necessary
or
denied
that
the
petitioner
has
been
deprived
a
constitutional
right
by
the
failure
of
the
state
of
washington
to
furnish
the
so-called
transcript
of
proceedings.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rationale
of
the
griffin
decision
is
simply
stated
that,
those
are
procedure
of
the
state
of
washington
as
in
illinois
placed
the
petitioner
at
a
substantial
disadvantage
because
of
his
poverty.
in
short,
with
respect
to
the
evidence
to
an
adequate
and
effective
appeal.
now,
i
suggest
that
not
only,
was
a
statement
of
facts
either
in
the
narrative
form
in
some
fashion,
not
made
available
nor
was
the
stenographic
transcript
to
the
proceedings
made
available.
certainly,
the
transcript
of
--
of
the
stenographic
transcript
of
proceedings
was
in
fact
necessary
to
the
effectuation
of
this
plaintiff's
appeal.
and
a
reference
to
the
court
rules
of
the
state
of
washington
in
the
elaborate
procedures
which
were
required
of
even
the
most
confident
counsel
would
certainly
indicate
that
this
petitioner,
incarcerated
in
the
washington
state
penitentiary,
with
the
--
a
theoretical
right
to
furnish
a
narrative
statement
could
not,
certainly
in
fact,
do
such.
i
would
point
out
that
not
only
did
he
make
however
application
for
the
stenographic
transcript,
but
he
made
application
for
a
statement
of
facts
in
whatever
form
might
be
appropriate
or
necessary
to
comply
with
the
appeal
procedure
requirements.
this
record,
i
submit,
raises
an
additional
question
as
to
the
additional
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
washington
to
remove
the
substantial
disadvantage
under
which
this
petitioner
labored
and
that
he
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
counsel
in
the
pursuit
of
his
appeal.
the
record,
i
think,
is
clear
that
he
certainly
did
not
waive,
he
did
not
--
contrary
to
the
state's
brief
and
response
-
did
not
discharge
his
trial
attorney.
the
trial
court
discharged
his
trial
attorney.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
we
have
an
official
court
recorder
system,
sir,
under
the
state
of
washington.
the
record
does
not
disclose
as
to
the
condition
of
the
court
reporter's
notes
with
respect
to
the
trial
proceedings
in
this
cause
which
took
place
in
1935.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record
in
any
place.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
only
relief
to
which
i
submit
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled,
is
the
vacation
of
the
judgment
denying
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
such
direction
to
the
washington
supreme
court
as
will
permit
this
man
to
take
an
appeal.
now,
whether
the
state
furnishes
a
transcript
to
this
indigent
in
the
form
of
a
complete
transcript
of
proceedings,
which
i
submit
is
the
only
practical
answer
to
the
entire
question
or
--
mr.
robert
w.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
is
--
that
is
entirely
correct,
sir.
the
simple
answer
he
was
furnished
nothing.
not
even
the
clerk's
transcript
which
could
not,
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago,
couldn't
raise
the
errors
occurring
at
the
trial
much
less
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
his
judgment
of
conviction
was
completely
contrary
to
the
weight
of
--
to
the
evidence.it
seems
to
me
that
in
terms
of
a
consideration
of
the
remand
of
--
of
this
matter
which
is
the
appropriate
relief,
i
suggest,
is
that
therein
here
is
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
state
of
washington
the
obligation
to
remove
the
substantial
disadvantage,
i
suggest,
of
the
lack
of
counsel.
i
recognize
that
the
griffin
decision
has
not
been
delimited
in
terms
of
its
implications,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
certainly,
this
is
a
minimum.
and
when
one
looks
at
the
labyrinth
of
the
criminal
procedures
in
our
state,
it
certainly,
i
think,
is
illusory
to
suggest
that
even
if
this
man
had
been
furnished
a
complete
stenographic
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
he
could
have
effectively
prosecuted
his
appeal.
he
was,
as
the
record
indicates,
an
uneducated
man.
he
elected
to
proceed
--
proceed
because
(inaudible)
whether
the
failure
to
furnish
him
a
statement
of
--
of
facts
either
by
complete
stenographic
transcript,
which
i
submit
is
the
only
practical
answer,
and
i
think
counsel
would
agree
is
the
only
way
in
which
i
know
appeal
is
in
our
supreme
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
entailed
the
additional
obligation
upon
the
members
of
the
bar
of
our
state
and
others
to
participate
in
the
effectuation
of
the
standard
which
this
court
announced
in
the
griffin
case.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
on
--
whether
is
an
agreed
statement
of
fact,
sir,
if
the
clerk's
record,
there
is
no
separate
clerk's
record
where
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
graham
i
wouldn't
say
and
i
agree
and
where
there's
a
short
--
a
short
--
under
shortened
procedure
where
the
statement
of
facts
may
consist
of
less
than
the
--
than
the
total
record.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
clerk
record
need
not
be
taken
up
but
unless
that
is
accomplished,
then
as
i
understand
the
procedure,
the
requirement
is
opt
for
the
clerk
to
forward
the
--
the
clerk's
record
physically,
if
i
understand
from
the
court
reporters
of
our
state
which
is,
perhaps,
not
on
the
record
but
physically,
the
clerk's
record
and
the
so-called
statement
or
the
statement
of
facts
are
physically
incorporated
in
one
document
by
the
court
reporter
as
he
sends
it
up
to
our
state
supreme
court.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
we
recognize
that
the
state
of
washington
certainly,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
griffin
case,
can
and
will
allow
a
frivolous
appeals.
that
issue
is
not
before
us.
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
graham
the
supreme
court
or
that
is
the
congress,
with
respect
to
federal
in
forma
pauperis
proceedings,
has
authorized
the
in
forma
pauperis
procedure
unless
the
trial
court
certifies
that
the
appeal
was
not
taken
in
good
faith.
now,
our
statute
which
authorized
the
trial
court
to
furnish
the
transcript,
if
in
his
--
if
in
his
judgment
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
served
does
not
purport
to
operate
on
that
premise.
the
remington's
revised
statute,
section
42-5,
which
is
the
statute
upon
which
this
petitioner
predicated
his
application,
does
not
purport
to
deny
him
that
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
court
finds
it
not
in
good
faith
or
that's
its
frivolous.
that
statute
authorizes
the
denial
of
the
transcript
or
denial
of
the
statement
of
facts
simply
because
the
trial
judge
thinks
the
ends
of
justice
would
not
be
served.
in
effect
the
trail
judge
has
got
to
decide
the
issue
on
appeal.
and
that
i
submit
is
an
entirely
different
question
from
the
good
faith
test
which
is
the
federal
in
forma
pauperis
procedure
incorporates.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
yes,
sir.
those
decisions
are
set
forth
in
the
memorandum
and
in
short,
our
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
trial
judge
in
his
absolute
discretion
in
furnishing
the
transcript.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
few
remaining
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
w.
graham
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
w.
graham
i
do
know
that
mr.
o'connell
has
reservations
for
home
tomorrow
and
i'm
happy
that
we
may
conclude
tonight
so
he
may
--
he
could
schedule,
that's
understandable.
in
answer
to
one
or
two
points
that
have
been
raised,
i
would
like
to
observe
that
under
the
provisions
of
our
official
court
reporter
act,
the
notes
of
the
reporters
are
kept
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
is
my
understanding,
sir,
and
i
was
not
aware,
the
record
does
not
reflect
anything
as
to
the
status
of
the
existing
court
reporter's
notes.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
would
present
certainly,
a
practical
matter,
i
would
--
i
would
assume.
i
would
want
to
correct
one
additional
observation
i
think.
counsel
inferred
that
the
petitioner
made
an
election
to
request
a
statement
of
fact
or
transcript
of
the
entire
proceedings
and
waived
his
right
to
request
a
clerk's
record
which
might
review
certain
errors
of
the
--
i
think
the
record
does
not
support
that,
if
the
court
please
that
this
man
asked
in
his
own
language
for
the
transcript
of
the
entire
proceedings
including
everything
in
it.
and
under
our
statute,
it
was
the
clerk's
obligation
to
furnish
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
and
that
wasn't
even
done.
there
is
an
information
in
this
record,
but
it
--
it
was
not
certified
on
his
appeal.
i
would
also
like
to
correct,
i
believe,
if
the
court
please,
a
reference
to
the
translate
on
the
--
transcript
on
the
writ
of
mandate.i
believe
the
certification
in
this
record
is
correct
that
the
proceedings
before
our
state
supreme
court
on
the
writ
of
mandate,
all
of
the
proceeding
were
--
are
here
in
this
record.
the
--
the
record
upon
which
the
supreme
court
of
washington
dismissed
this
man's
appeal
in
the
criminal
conviction
and
simultaneously,
dismissed
his
application
for
the
transcript
or
for
the
writ
of
mandate
to
secure
the
transcript.
those
actions
were
simultaneously,
taken
upon
a
transcript
certified
up
by
the
county
clerk
in
spokane
county
and
that
record
in
turn
is
--
is
before
us.
so
i
think
--
mr.
robert
w.
graham
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
--
that
record
on
which
our
state
supreme
court
acted
on
the
writ
of
mandate
is
incorporated
in
this
record
and
the
certification
of
our
supreme
court
clerk
so
shows
it
would
be
the
proceedings
before
that
court
back
in
1936.
there
is
correspondence
that
is
not
in
the
file.
the
transcript
was
prepared
by
agreement
between
myself
and
the
attorney
general's
office
and
i
believe
that
it
does
include
all
of
the
documents
of
record.
there
are
certain
matters
of
correspondence
that,
i
think,
just
as
--
as
counsel
the
case
would
not
be
here
material.
there
is
some
confusion,
i
think,
in
probably
my
own
mind
as
well
as
in
terms
of
this
concept
of
bill
of
exceptions,
statement
of
facts,
and
transcript
and
so
forth,
i
think,
it
perhaps
has
been
clarified
that
under
the
procedures
of
the
state
of
washington,
to
review
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
verdict
is
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
the
supreme
court
must
have
before
it
either
in
question
and
answer
form,
by
transcript
or
the
stenographer's
notes
or
a
full
and
complete
narration
helps
and
are
not
a
--
not
a
part
on
that
premise,
that
the
--
that
the
statement
of
facts
may
be
either
narrative
or
question
and
answer
form,
but
the
fact
is
it
must
be
of
the
entire
proceedings,
all
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses.
and
as
the
court
will
note
in
the
court
rules,
to
which
i
have
referred
and
which
i
have
incorporated
in
toto
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
he
not
only
must
file
that
statement
of
facts
and
transcript
but
also
must
prepare
an
abstract.
and
the
abstract
in
detail
must
show
the
witness,
who
he
was,
what
he
said
in
all
of
the
proceedings.
my
point
is
simply
this.
this
man
is
in
prison
in
the
state
of
washington
without
access
to
counsel,
certainly
without
access
to
the
court
reporter's
notes
of
the
trial
judge.
it
was
--
it's
a
completely
illusory
position
to
suggest
that
he
himself
could
prepare
a
statement
of
facts
sufficient
to
constitute
a
narrative
statement
that
would
warrant
the
review
of
the
entire
evidence
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
at
that
time
when
he
was
in
--
as
counsel
has
suggested,
that
this
man
in
1936
could
--
well,
he
could
have
made
up
a
statement
of
facts
in
narrative
form.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
counsel's
position
is
that
he
could
do
it
by
himself.he
points
out
that
legally,
under
the
court
rules
and
the
same
was
true
in
illinois
and
griffin,
that
a
narrative
statement
can
be
prepared
and
utilized
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
w.
graham
and
--
and
as
it
--
you
--
you
call
it
a
bill
of
exceptions,
sir,
on
--
in
the
--
in
your
background.
and
to
us,
it's
a
--a
statement
of
fact.
it
--
it's
one
and
the
same
thing
as
counsel
has
suggested.
but
the
--
the
fact
is
that,
in
1936
with
this
man
in
prison
and
without
the
availability
of
the
stenographic
transcript,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
cannot
say
that
he
was
not
under
substantial
disadvantage
as
compared
to
persons
who
had
means.
i
think
those,
basically,
are
the
issues
here
as
i
say
whether
this
court
sees
fit
to
announce
a
constitutional
obligation
of
the
state
in
all
instances
to
furnish
counsel,
is
perhaps
the
question
we
don't
have
to
decide.
even
i
suggest
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
in
each
and
every
case,
a
complete
transcript
is
necessary.
there
are
two
additional
points
raised
in
the
brief
of
respondent.
they
are
jurisdictional
character
only.
i
simply
refer
to
the
reply
brief
which
has
been
filed
to
dispose
of
those
two
matters
which
have
not
been
argued
by
the
counsel.thank
you
for
your
time.
