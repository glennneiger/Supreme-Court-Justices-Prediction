mr.
john
j.
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
distinguished
counsel.
the
facts
as
outlined
by
mr.
graham
are
substantially
correct.
i
may
add
these
additional
facts
following
the
charge
of
first
degree
murder
being
lodged
against
the
petitioner.
he
contacted
the
firm
of
donovan
and
donovan
attorneys
who
for
some
period
of
time
were
cognizant
of
this
case.
these
same
attorneys
at
the
request
of
the
petitioner
when
the
petitioner
could
not
raise
funds,
were
appointed
by
the
trial
judge
in
this
case.
i
think
a
fair
examination
of
the
record
would
indicate
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
not
an
illiterate
or
ignorant
man.
i
think
a
fair
analysis
of
the
documents
he
has
filed
in
our
appellate
court
would
indicate
that
he
is
a
contentious,
aggressive
and
literate.
when
the
petitioner
in
this
case
requested
the
trial
judge
to
grant
him
a
transcript
of
the
records
in
my
case
the
trial
judge
treated
this
as
a
request
for
a
full
stenographic
transcript
under
the
statute
enforced
at
that
time.
the
trial
judge
decided
that
justice
would
not
be
promoted,
which
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
by
granting
this
petitioner
a
stenographic
transcript.
from
this
decision
of
the
trial
court,
the
petitioner
took
a
writ
of
mandate
directly
on
this
point.our
supreme
court
reviewed
the
precise
action
of
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
and
decided
that
the
writ
of
mandate
did
not
lie.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
our
records
submitted
to
this
court,
if
your
honor
please,
does
not
disclose
the
entire
record
upon
which
our
state
supreme
court
acted.
there
was
a
transcript
of
certain
of
the
proceedings
of
the
trial
judge
that
were
--
that
was
filed
in
the
records
of
this
writ
of
mandate
that
have
not
been
forwarded
to
this
court.
but
other
than
that,
there
is
no
record.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
would
add
anything
of
substance
to
this
matter.
the
petitioner
setting
out
as
errors
alleged
four
things.
the
information
was
duplicitous,
he
was
brought
to
trial
too
soon,
he
wanted
a
continuance,
the
verdict
was
contrary
to
the
evidence
and
the
instructions,
and
newly
discovered
evidence
and
some
allegations
of
conspiracy
of
perjury.
this
matter
or
these
allegations
were
before
the
trial
court,
they
were
before
the
appellate
court.
now,
the
petitioner
being
denied
his
complete
and
full
stenographic
transcript
which
we
call
a
statement
of
facts,
nevertheless,
had
alternative
remedies.
his
first
remedy,
specifically
by
statute,
was
to
act
--
ask
for
a
clerk's
record
which
he
never
asked
for.
he
preferred
to
rely
exclusively
on
his
alleged
right
for
a
full
stenographic
transcript.
our
statute
in
existence
at
that
time
allowed
the
clerk's
record
which
was
compiled
at
the
instance
of
the
appellant,
in
this
case
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
could
go
to
the
clerk
and
say,
“i
want
this
and
this
and
this
and
this.”
starting
out
with
the
information,
all
the
preliminary
affidavits,
motions
and
rulings
ending
up
with
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court,
verdict
of
the
jury,
and
the
sentencing
judgment.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
your
honor,
i
must
disagree
with
mr.
graham
in
that
regard.
just
the
call
this
clerk's
record
would
probably
not
cause
our
appellate
court
to
take
any
cognizance
of
it.
in
addition,
to
the
court's
record,
there
must
be
a
bill
of
exceptions
or
an
assignment
of
error
perhaps
more
properly
called
to
saying
the
information
is
duplicitous
in
this
regard.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
in
my
opinion?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
would
say
a
mere
assignment
of
error.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well,
perhaps,
your
honor,
i
might
most
likely
call
it
a
bill
of
exceptions
rather
than
assignment
of
error.
but
in
the
transcribing
of
this
clerk's
record
to
the
supreme
court,
there
must
be
some
statement
by
the
appellant
as
to
what
he
alleges
occurred
as
error
in
the
clerk's
record.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
done
in
many,
many
cases
to
this
day
where
no
evidence
at
all
is
taken
in
the
trial
court
and
the
matter
goes
up
wholly
on
the
clerk's
record.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
these
were
the
grounds
alleged
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
they
could
have
with
the
exception
of
one.
the
verdict
was
contrary
to
the
evidence
which,
of
course
,would
require
the
full
stenographic
transcript
of
the
proceedings
or
at
least
a
fairly
full
narrative
statement
so
that
the
court
would
know
what
the
evidence
was.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
or
without
the
bill
of
exceptions.
now,
this
remedy
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well,
in
our
state,
the
bill
of
exceptions
is
a
statement
of
facts,
is
a
stenographic
transcript.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
the
terms
are
used
interchangeably.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes.
a
narrative
statement
of
facts
would
be
a
bill
of
exceptions.our
original
statute,
if
your
honor
please,
call
this
entire
transcript
or
record
a
bill
of
exceptions.
the
terms
“statement
of
facts”
and
“stenographic
transcript”
were
used
in
subsequent
rules
in
the
statutes.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
correct
or
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
bill
of
exceptions
has
to
contain
a
transcript.
it
does
not
have
to,
in
our
state,
be
a
stenographic
transcript
nor
need
it
be
a
full
statement
of
all
of
the
evidence
and
testimony
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.however,
it
is
felt
that
a
narrative
statement
similar
to
the
bystander's
bill
of
exception
either
prepared
by
counsel
for
the
appellant
or
the
appellant
himself
could
contain
sufficient
narration
of
extensive
enough
scope
to
bring
in
the
question
of
adequacy
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
verdict.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
a
narrative
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes,
there
is.
that's
my
second
point.
number
one,
he
could
have
the
clerk's
record
which
he
did
not
choose
to
take.
number
two,
failing
the
clerk's
record,
he
could
file
in
lieu
of
a
stenographic
transcript
a
narrative
statement
of
facts
extracting
from
the
record
in
narrative
form
the
particular
areas
of
the
record
he
desired
to
present
to
the
appellate
court.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
merely,
your
honor,
they
--
hour-by-hour
record
as
during
the
continuance
of
the
trial.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
his
own
notes,
the
notes
of
his
counsel.
i
could
assume
the
reporter
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
--
is
there
and
available
to
him
for
refreshment
or
recollection.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
well,
he
can
talk
to
the
reporter.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
there
were
many
incidents
or
--
or
methods
the
man
in
question
could
have
used.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes.when
he
prepares
this
narrative
statement,
he
takes
it
to
the
trial
judge
and
the
trial
judge
settles
it
according
to
the
position
of
the
other
counsel.
now,
this
has
been
used
in
our
state
for
many,
many
years
and
in
our
brief
is
outlined
to
the
court
a
long
line
of
cases
in
which
the
narrative
statement
of
facts
or
transcript
has
been
used
and
in
fact,
in
one
case,
our
supreme
court
said
that
such
a
narrative
style
should
be
encouraged.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
yes,
sir.
i
do.
i
would
say
this.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
give
it
--
it
depends
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
no,
no.
that
issue
has
not
been
determined.
and
if
due
process
as
this
court
said
in
betts
versus
brady
is
a
fluid
concept
to
be
determined
by
the
totality
of
all
the
facts,
then
the
ingenuity,
the
ignorance,
or
the
understanding,
or
the
intelligence
of
this
defendant
is
one
of
those
facts,
the
totality
of
which
will
give
you
due
process.
and
that
is
why,
i
initially
said
that
an
examination
of
the
record
would
see,
would
show
that
we're
not
dealing
with
the
--
an
illiterate,
ignorant
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
the
point
is
we're
not
talking
about
this
year.we're
talking
about
the
latter
part
of
1935
and
1936
when
all
of
these
things
were
available
to
him.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
but
my
point
is
the
narrative
statement
was
available
to
him
in
1935.
why
should
he
be
--
come
now
to
this
court
23
years
later
and
say,
“i
want
a
narrative
statement
or
a
full
stenographic
statement.”
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
it's
creatively
enough,
your
honor,
and
that
doesn't
show
on
the
record
but
i
am
informed
he
is
still
living.
he
is
a
clerk
for
one
of
the
federal
judges
in
the
state
of
washington.
he
has
these
notes
in
his
possession
and
he
has
informed
us
at
least
so
i
am
informed
that
they
are
transcribable,
but
the
issue
remains
the
same.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
at
--
in
1935,
60
days.
now,
90
days.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
he
took
a
timely
appeal,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
our
analysis.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
he
never
asked
for
a
lawyer
thereafter.
he
elected
to
handle
this
matter
himself.as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
--
in
the
record
discloses
that
he
desired
to
discharge
the
attorneys
that
the
court
appointed
at
his
request,
not
any
attorney
but
the
attorneys
he
--
he
requested.
he
desired
to
discharge
him.
the
court
would
not
allow
a
discharge
until
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
an
arrest
of
judgment
were
argued
that
they
are
after,
they
withdrew
with
the
court's
permission.
we
claim
therefore,
your
honors,
on
the
second
point,
the
counsel
on
appeal
just
briefly.
we
contend
he
did
not
desire
counsel,
did
not
seek
counsel,
in
effect
discharged
his
counsel
and
waived
any
right
he
had
in
that
regard.
we
contend
this
issue
was
not
raised
except
in
this
court.
he
was
prohibited
by
a
court
rule.
we
further
alleged
that
there
is
no
case
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
or
in
--
in
this
situation
that
allows
him
such
relief.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
can
retire
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
no,
that's
quite
all
right,
your
honor
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connell
i
think
we
have
made
our
position,
your
honor.
