justice
felix
frankfurter
you
contest
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it's
a
matter
of
law.
you
say
that
if
there
had
been
no
war,
this
appellant
may
--
mckinney
may
have
known
the
job
and
he
could
have
enforced
the
legal
right
to
get
a
promotion
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
would
--
do
you
agree
that
your
rights
under
the
statute
must
depend
on
whether
he
had
a
right?
he
would
have
--
he
would
have
got
him
to
class
1
position
have
he
--
had
he
continued
on
the
job
without
any
military
interruption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
the
mode
of
proof
is
--
at
the
moment
is
my
interest.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
statute
gives
him
something
that
he
--
that
would
have
been
denied
to
him
that
he
couldn't
legally
claim
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
if
he
remained
in
continuous
employment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
does.
you
rule
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
out
what
we
--
the
rights
are
under
the
collective
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
you
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
must
be
given
the
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
in
as
much
--
this
turn
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
you
raise
--
you
raise
the
contestable
issue
which
would
had
been
allowed
to
go
to
prove,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
more
could
he
been
entitled
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
he
could
have
been
denied
of
preference.i
don't
mean
a
preference,
seniority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
depends
on
what
the
preference
statute
the
veteran
statute
means.
does
it
mean
he
could
get
something
he
could
have
been
deprived
of
or
he
wouldn't
have
got
if
he
just
state
an
employment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statute
doesn't
imply
or
you're
not
contending
it
for
a
construction
that
because
of
this
statute,
retrospectively,
the
veteran
must
be
given
a
preference
that
he
wouldn't
have
enjoyed
if
industry
had
gone
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
there
--
under
the
collective
agreement,
internal
collective
agreement
procedure
for
determining.
suppose
he
hadn't
been
given
seniority
position,
what
was
then
the
collective
agreement
that
is
--
would
enabled
him
to
charge
that
as
a
grievance
subject
to
grievance
procedure.
was
there
a
grievance
procedure
on
such
a
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
rule?
29?
justice
felix
frankfurter
31.
so
that
--
let
me
see
how
this
goes.
you
go
to
--
i
suppose
you
were
allowed
to
go
to
the
issue
and
you
put
in
your
testimony
and
the
--
the
employers
says
"no,
i
wouldn't
have
him."
is
this
retrospective
going
back
to
a
long
time?
or
he
--
would
he
first
have
to
go
to
the
procedure
under
the
collective
--
under
rule
31?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
would
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
about
some
more
questions
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i'm
left
--
a
little
confused,
before
recess
you
indicated
in
reply
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
douglas
that
what
you
are
seeking
is
on
the
pleading
the
right
to
determine
that
he
was
in
a
--
he
was
in
a
position
whereby
he
was
qualified
to
be
selected
by
the
employer
to
this
--
to
this
more
desirous
senior
position,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
said
in
answer
to
this
question,
by
mr.
justice
douglas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
was
that
you
objected
to
--
that
this
came
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
--
which
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
where
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
said
you
could
prove
a
prior
claim,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
a
trial.
but
now
you
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
would
have
been
appointed
to
this
position.
isn't
that
what
you
just
said
a
minute
ago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
you
again,
so
to
refer
to
the
question
i
put
you
before
the
recess,
would
that
require
--
should
he
complain
that
he
wasn't
put
in
a
position
to
which
if
the
employer
have
exercised
his
fair
discretion
he
might
have
been,
the
date.
does
that
mean
he
has
to
--
that
we
now
have
to
send
this
back
and
it
has
to
go
to
procedure
under
31?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
he
get
anymore
--
can
a
man
got
anymore
under
this
record
service
act
that
he
would
have
had
if
he
had
continued
without
war
interruption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
--
if
--
if
under
--
if
the
latter
situation
had
prevailed
namely,
that
the
industrial
condition
would
have
--
under
that,
he
merely
would
have
had
a
grievance
if
he
hadn't
given
the
right
he
has
under
a
collective
bargaining.
then
why
does
he
get
anything
different
if
not
more?
and
under
the
collective
bargaining,
if
he
isn't
put
--
put
in
a
position
of
seniority,
he
can
complain
under
your
rule
31.
why
should
the
court
now
determine,
is
there
a
jury
or
whoever
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
we're
back
again,
asking
around
will
he
again
--
you
said
that
he
can't
get
anything
more
under
the
statute
and
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
operated
without
interruption
of
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
he
get
more?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
collective
bargaining
--
if
the
collective
bargaining
contract
receives
the
statute
then
the
collective
bargaining
contract
determines
what
he's
entitled
to
and
is
read
into
the
statute,
that's
what
they
decided
in
the
aeronautical
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
does
he
get
more
than
he
would
have
had
if
there
had
been
no
war?
i
can't
--
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
the
measure
of
his
right
are
the
continuing
operation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
measure
of
his
right
is
that
which
the
collective
bargaining
would
have
given
him
if
the
war
hadn't
interrupted
its
operation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
regard
that
as
far
as
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
that's
--
that
issue
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
by
practice
or
by
perceiving
these
words.
i
still
insist
on
having
you
tell
me
to
what
extent
if
this
can
prove
that
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
antedating
the
statute
and
his
service
are
infused
into
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
what
i'm
saying
is
what
he's
entitled
under
the
statute
cannot
be
ascertained
without
looking
at
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
the
continuity
of
which
he
is
--
on
the
continuity
of
which
as
to
him,
he
insist.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
to
be
taking
your
time
but
this
seems
to
me
very
important.
suppose
the
employer
now
says,
i
would
not
have
appointed
you
in
1942
or
whenever
it
was,
i
would
have
referred
jim
jones
to
you
and
i
was
right
to
make
that
choice.
now,
since
we
are
retrospective,
why
shouldn't
the
same
mode
by
which
mckinney
has
a
grievance
prevailed
and
why
does
the
statute
cut
out
to
procedure
by
which
that
issue
is
determined,
i
do
not
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
does
the
statute
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
--
how
do
you
know
whether
he's
--
and
what
determines
whether
he
is
or
isn't
entitled.
if
it's
a
question
of
discretion
can
--
looking
back
and
the
answer
of
that
isn't
true
in
1942,
you
would've
picked
me,
you
now
say,
you
wouldn't
have
pick
me.
why
isn't
it
a
grievance
to
which
he
is
complaining
provided
for
by
this
anteceding
agreement
which
seeks
to
avoid
the
frictions
by
having
us
to
establish
procedure
for
determining
this
conflict?
why
is
that
cut
out
by
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
whole
point
is
that
we
have
--
you
assert
he
is
asserting
a
statutory
right
and
the
only
statutory
right
he
has
is
to
be
put
in
a
position
he
would
have
been
in
1942,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now
--
now,
how
do
you
that
if
there's
a
conflict
about
that
there
is
a
regular
peaceful
procedure
for
determining
that
within
the
shop
or
within
the
industry
or
whatever
it
is.
and
you
say
the
statute
cuts
that
procedure
out,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
he
is
entitled
to
under
--
if
he
had
continued,
what
would
he
been
entitled
to?
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
assert
his
right,
the
employer
rejected
that
right.
very
well,
they
come
to
a
conflict
and
then
there's
a
mode
of
determining.
that's
all
he's
entitled
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mode
of
procedure
the
way
and
pay
--
pay
isn't
a
fixed
strike,
is
it?
does
it?
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he's
entitled
to
what
--
he's
entitled
to
the
choice
that
the
employer
would
have
made
in
1942,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
in
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
employer
has
made
a
choice
which
entitled
him
to
the
seniority,
then
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose
i
won't
take
anymore
of
your
time
but
i
can't
follow
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
give
him
any
different
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
specifically,
if
his
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
--
under
a
collective
agreement
is
to
determine
by
--
to
be
determined
by
a
particular
procedure,
does
he
under
the
section
9
get
a
right
to
disregard
that
procedure
and
ask
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
any
different
from
the
choice
of
agencies
in
the
federal
government
to
take
one
of
three,
if
that's
--
that
is
the
law
that
any
department
or
bureau
can
take
one
of
three
that
--
that
there
--
that
the
service
commission
certified,
the
employer
can
take
him
for
any
reason,
no
reason
or
bad
reason
or
indifferent
reasons.
he
is
really
against
credited
people,
he
doesn't
have
to
say
i
don't
want
to
write
it
in
then
but
he
doesn't
take
it.
no
amount
of
complaint
in
pay.
he
rejected
me.
i
found
out
terms
of
each
particular
strange
creature
that
doesn't
like
credited
people
in
your
office
and
that's
why
he
rejected
me.
i
don't
suppose
any
court
would
entertain
that
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
merely
a
--
almost
an
arithmetic
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
subject
for
agreement
or
procedure
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
if
you
have
read
the
grievance
procedure,
it
said
--
he
said,
"i
wanted
to
go
to
the
grievance
to
do
that."
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
--
that's
all
he
could
do?
that
they
--
that's
all
he
all
he
could
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
the
amplitude
of
the
collective
agreement,
he
could
raise
any
question.
so
practically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
grievance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends
upon
whoever,
if
this
may
eventually
go
up
into
some
private
arbitrary
(inaudible)
or
maybe
go
up
with
the
adjustment
board
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
you're
--
you're
very
firm
and
unequivocal
in
saying
that
this
is
precatory
and
--
and
that's
all.
in
other
words,
that
of
course
is
affirmatively
that
the
management
is
unrestricted,
be
it
(inaudible)
or
put
people
is
--
is
under
no
legal
obligation,
no
under
contract
obligation,
take
anybody
from
class
two
to
class
one
if
in
consideration
bring
(inaudible).
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
materials
there
are,
if
we
have
to
decide
that,
if
that's
the
(inaudible)
part
--
part
of
the
problem
before
us
to
construe
their
collective
agreement,
and
i
go
on
--
don't
want
to
decide
that
without
having
a
great
deal
of
the
practical
application
to
this
agreement
in
the
light
of
the
agreement
and
the
experience
both
of
management
and
of
your
brotherhood,
are
there
such
materials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
hasn't
this
question
come
up
and
you've
had
--
i
don't
know
what
the
(inaudible)
indicated
to,
other
railroads
have
had
this
kind
of
an
agreement
with
your
brotherhood
for
a
good
many
years,
doesn't
it?
or
for
how
many
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
how
many
years
has
there
been
an
agreement
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1925.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1925,
so
from
1925
down
to
1941,
there
was
no
break
so
far
as
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
what
i
want
to
know,
are
there
no
materials
in
actual
instances,
i
don't
mean
law,
most
of
these
questions
from
my
point
of
view
are
very
badly
decided
nearly
as
so
called
abstract
legal
questions,
that's
my
own
--
all
the
absorbed
--
all
sorts
of
experiences
that
lawyers
don't
know
anything
about
except
specialists
(inaudible)
don't
know
anything
about.
but
haven't
there
instances
or
isn't
in
which
a
fellow
in
class
two
wanted
to
move,
as
a
matter
of
right
under
the
agreement
to
class
one.
the
management
have
known
under
(inaudible)
raised
about
it
and
he
ask
these
officers,
the
officers
of
the
brotherhood
to
go
and
make
claims
from
etcetera,
etcetera.
there'd
been
no
such
instances?
had
the
question
never
contested?
that
for
me
would
be
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
between
1925
and
1939,
no
instance
had
arisen
in
which
somebody
who
was
way
up
on
top
in
class
two
wasn't
taken
into
class
one.
that
for
me
would
be
very
persuasive
as
to
what
the
situation
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap)
years
--
well,
what
period
of
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
1925
to
1939?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
this
problem
come
up
at
all
or
has
it
been
taken
for
granted?
that's
what
it
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
by
management
and
by
--
by
the
brotherhood
and
their
counsel
who
represent
not
this
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
donohue,
may
i
ask
one
more
question
along
the
line
we've
exchanged.
would
the
record
be
available
if
you
--
when
you
speak
of
your
own
experience
and
knowledge
whether
as
a
matter
fact,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
the
period
of
which
--
to
which
you
do
address
1925
to
1939,
men
moved
exclusively
into
class
one
from
class
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
your
associate
on
the
railroad
side
would
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
put
to
you
a
problem
in
connection
with
this?
a
line
of
argument
from
the
(inaudible)
very
sympathetic,
but
these
cases
to
which
you
refer,
the
slocum
on
that
basis,
those
cases
are
bereft
without
the
element
that
we
have
in
this
case,
to
this
type
of
case,
namely,
those
cases
came
up
directly
with
reference
to
the
enforceability
of
certain
rights
under
an
agreement.
now,
in
this
case
we
got
the
meaning
and
scope
of
a
railroad
collective
bargain
agreement,
but
we
also
have
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
you
saying
that
if
and
in
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
we
select
the
service
act,
section
9,
it
involves
necessarily
a
construction
of
such
a
railroad
agreement.
at
all
events,
the
court
should
hold
it
hands
until
it
get
the
construction
of
that
agreement
from
the
only
agency
capable
of
making
such
a
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
that,
i
mean
wouldn't
you
say
that
certainly
that
should
be
done
whether
it
should
be
dismissed
and
wait
until
you
have
a
new
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
say,
it
was
safe
inference
that
the
intention
of
congress
was
that
they
didn't
think
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
union
wouldn't
go
on
his
behalf
would
it
or
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean,
in
the
ordinary
course,
i'm
not
suggesting
any
ill
will
or
anything
but
just
the
ordinary
course
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
merely
assumed
that
the
union
wouldn't
present
a
cause
in
which
they
wholly
disbelieve
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
free
to
do
it.
they
would
be
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
that's
all
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
your
answer
to
chief
justice's
question
is
quite
unequivocal,
namely,
that
according
to
some
case
to
which
you
referred,
he
could
go
on
his
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
get
your
latches
point,
mr.
donohue?
or
waive
upon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
waiver
usually
implies
some
disadvantageous
change
of
position
on
the
basis
of
the
conduct
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
one
such
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
he
wrote
a
letter
--
i
think
he
wrote
a
letter
saying,
i
have
to
make
a
living
for
my
family,
i'll
take
this
but
i
want
to
know
i'm
going
to
--
(inaudible)
in
due
course,
could
he
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
he
allege,
he
protested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
was
--
what
do
mean
--
that
means
he
just
(inaudible),
is
that
what
the
protest
might
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
all
events,
if
there
is
no
statement
that
he
duly
advice
that
this
is
an
--
illegal
act
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
remember
(inaudible)
the
question
or
related
questions
arising
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
where
this
court
some
years
ago
had
occasioned
to
which
the
shippers
and
the
railroad
and
concededly
that
the
basis
for
a
recovery
in
the
district
court.
this
court
said,
this
involves
some
construction
of
that
and
the
matter
of
fact
which
the
icc
should
first
pass
on
that
unless
the
district
court
hold
this
case
until
we
--
until
they
get
such
an
authority
in
ruling
in
a
matter
in
which
judge
--
judges
in
the
courts
aren't
particularly
competent
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
also
have
a
collective
agreement
problem.
isn't
it
that
one
can
read
as
all
of
us
have
read
more
than
once
section
9,
and
not
get
the
answer
to
this
question
--
to
this
problem,
at
least
i
couldn't
possibly
get
the
answer
to
the
problem
that
you
present
by
reading
it
faithfully,
as
conscientiously,
and
as
sympathetically
section
9,
you
couldn't
get
from
section
9?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
get
it
from
section
9
in
relation
to
that
agreement
--
the
collective
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
he
got
the
position
that
he
wants,
the
status
that
he
want,
it's
still
doesn't
answer
whether
in
giving
him
the
status
when
they
did
give
him
they
exercised
a
non-criminal
discretion.
or
whether
they
gave
it
to
him
because
having
fear
of
choice,
they
picked
on
him.
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
does
your
answer
imply
the
construction
of
the
agreement.
and
that's
the
question
of
justice
black
put
to
you.
whether
the
construction
of
the
agreement
should
be
left
to
12
jurymen
or
a
district
judge
or
should
be
left
to
the
peculiarly
qualified
specially
designated
congressionally
created
bodies.
