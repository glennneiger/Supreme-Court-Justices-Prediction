justice
charles
e.
whittaker
doesn't
this
mean,
mr.
laughlin,
that
even
if
mr.
mckinney
had
been
present
on
his
job
with
the
k-t
railroad
that
the
time
these
two
positions
were
bulleted
--
bulletined,
there
was
no
assurance
that
he
would
be
given
either
of
them?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
the
next
question.
why
do
you
say
that
this
--
mr.
mckinney's
seniority
date
should
have
been
the
8th
or
the
12th
of
september?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
rule
attached
to
the
petition
--
the
complaint
rather
will
force
specifically
he
says
that
seniority
begins
at
the
time
the
pay
starts
in
that
rule,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
then
does
that
mean
that
his
pay
didn't
start
until
october
when
he
got
back
in
the
army
and
went
back
to
work?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
isn't
that
the
beginning
of
his
seniority
under
that
rule?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
statute
doesn't
--
except
maybe
you
--
you
demonstrate
indirectly.
it
doesn't
mention
anything
about
seniority,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
seniority?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
--
i'm
worried
about
the
factor
here
that
you
may
be
able
(inaudible)
you
say
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
tried
and
tested
in
likelihood
that
he
would
in
fact
have
been
given
a
job
that
he
now
seeks.
but
where
in
the
complaint
do
you
find
any
such
charge?
you
feel
that
the
court
here
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss.
this
isn't
revealed
in
that
action.
it
does
not
to
complaint
on
this
ordinarily
say
in
paragraph
(4)
that
plaintiff
was
therefore
at
the
time
of
this
--
of
his
return
to
defendant's
employee
entitled
to
exercise
his
seniority
rights
and
place
himself
in
the
position
of
bill
clerk
or
in
the
position
of
assistant
cashier
in
accordance
with
rule
1
(3)
(a)
of
said
bargaining
agreement.
now,
that's
the
allegation,
is
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
nowhere
does
the
--
i
haven't
seen
it
or
made.
does
he
anywhere
allege
that
in
very
truth,
he
would
have
gotten
this
job
had
he
been
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
does
attached
the
contract
as
a
--
as
an
exhibit
anyway,
he
doesn't.
and
the
paragraph,
it
seems
to
me,
unless
you
can
clear
this
up,
(3)
of
the
contract
says
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
seniority
in
that
group
except
from
the
day
his
pay
starts
in
that
group.
