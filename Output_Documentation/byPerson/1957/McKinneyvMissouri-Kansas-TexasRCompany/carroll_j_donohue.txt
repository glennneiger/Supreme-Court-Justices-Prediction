mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
which
intervened
in
this
action,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
most
--
that
motion
was
sustained
and
we
have
proceeded
through
the
appellate
processes
as
a
party
to
this
case.
it's
my
primary
objective
to
touch
upon
some
matters
over
and
above
the
subject
matter
dealt
with
by
mr.
clinton.
but
i
should
like
first
to
say
clearly
and
emphatically
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
that
the
result
achieved
below
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed
and
sustained
by
this
court.
we
concur
on
the
issue
raised
by
mr.
clinton
and
discussed
by
counsel
for
the
government.
we
concur
with
the
railroad
that
no
cost
of
action
was
stated.
the
matter
was
properly
dismissed.
i
think
i
can
summarize
very
tersely
precisely
how
we
understand
the
issue
here.
we
believe
we
comprehend
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
we
think
we
understand
the
escalator
principle
annunciated
in
the
fishgold
case.
and
then
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
another
uniformly
followed
subsequently.
we
believe
that
this
concept
of
reasonable
probability
is
a
fanciful
figment
to
the
imagination
which
has
no
basis
whatever
in
the
decided
cases,
no
basis
under
the
statute
and
should
be
fairly
disregarded.
we
think
in
addition
that
crystalizing
what
this
contract
is
all
about
and
what
it
means,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
under
the
terms
of
this
contract
where
the
petitioners
claim,
there
is
nothing
to
send
back
to
a
trial
court.
we
feel
that
it's
crystal
clear
that
under
rule
1
(3)
(a)
which
is
the
one
involved
here,
the
references
to
the
moving
from
class
two
to
class
one
are
solely
and
exclusively
precatory
and
nothing
more
and
nothing
else,
and
therefore
that
no
right
of
any
nature,
description
exist
on
the
part
of
this
petitioner,
nor
is
there
any
probability
one
way
or
the
other
that's
legally
recognizable.
if
your
honors
will
note
the
south
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well
now,
what
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
is
that
there
is
no
right
whatever
to
move
from
two
to
one.
there
is
a
seniority
right
within
the
people
in
one
and
a
seniority
right
with
the
people
within
two.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
it's
entirely
a
matter
of
management's
decision.
let's
examine
this
paragraph.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
think
it
is.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well
no,
grievances
are
covered
by
another
paragraph,
your
honor.
the
--
the
paragraph
that
i'm
referring
to
which
talks
about
the
movement
from
two
to
one
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
at
page
6
your
honor
of
the
transcript,
paragraph
3a
indicate
this
by
a
capital
a.
i'm
starting
with
the
second
sentence,
promotion
will
be
confined
to
the
group
herein
named
with
the
exception
that
employees
on
positions
enumerated
in
group
two
will
be
given
preference
over
nonemployees
in
the
assignment
to
positions
in
group
one
based
upon
fitness
and
ability.
and
then
it
refers
to
a
rule
6
which
has
no
bearing
on
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
we
--
let
me
--
in
this
particular
case
nonemployees
were
hired.
we
don't
believe
that
that
language
confers
any
legally
recognizable
right
on
anybody.
it's
simply
an
utterance.
we'll
do
the
best
we
can
for
you
if
we
can.
but
it's
apparent
from
the
language
of
that
paragraph,
its
lack
of
certainty,
its
lack
of
mechanics
for
being
carried
forward
that
its
nothing
but
a
precatory
utterance
that
a
break
will
be
given
to
the
people
in
group
two
to
be
put
up
to
group
one
if
management
wants
to
do
it
and
there
is
no
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
no
more
or
less
than
thereto
(voice
overlap).
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
what's
that
your
honor?
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
we
say
there
is
no
rational
way
in
the
world
to
tell
whether
he
would
or
he
would
not.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
we
don't
there's
any
basis
for
him
to
have
it.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
of
course
there's
a
very
broad
grievance
procedures
spelled
out
in
the
--
in
the
agreement.
and
therefore
certainly
i
think
there
is
no
reason
that
he
couldn't
initiate
one,
what
would
ultimately
be
held
and
whether
it
would
be
held
that
he
had
a
right
to
proceed
would
be
another
matter.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
--
i
think
you
could
do
that
with
any
kind
of
complaint
he
have.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
i
think
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
that's
right.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
if
he
raises
a
specific
question
i
think
the
answer
would
be
this
is
a
decision
for
management
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
but
he
at
least
would
have
the
right
to
invoke.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
that
--
we'll
come
to
that
of
course.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
we
urge
that
there
is
no
right
created
by
this
contract
and
actually,
nothing
for
a
court
to
determine.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
there
might
be.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
right.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
think
the
employer
can
put
in
anybody
he
wants.
i
think
he
has
a
--
perhaps
a
precatory
moral
obligation
to
look
over
the
group
two
people.
you
will
note
carefully
that
there
isn't
any
priority
on
the
group
two
seniority
to
this
preference.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
no,
it's
not.
within
group
two
is
another
matter
your
honor.
within
group
two
there
is
seniority
and
based
upon
the
rest
of
the
agreement,
not
included
in
this
paragraph.
there
is
seniority
within
group
two,
recognizable
and
enforceable,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
nobody
in
group
two
has
any
right
to
be
put
into
group
one.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
they
may
all
be
fit
and
able,
even
though
he's
fit
and
able.
i
think
the
language
is
clear.
you
--
patently,
the
language
here
just
isn't
definite
and
certain.
how
could
you
tell
which
one
in
group
two?
it
simply
says
that
the
preference
will
be
given
to
group
two
employees.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
your
honor
that
the
contract
says
anything
of
the
sort.
i
think
you
have
to
read
into
the
contract
a
considerable
amount
of
material
that
isn't
there
to
arrive
with
that
conclusion.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
petitioner
in
his
complaint
relied
entirely
upon
the
agreement.
and
i
don't
think
you
have
any
materials
available
except
the
agreement.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
honest
--
well,
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
1925.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
this
language
has
been
the
same
since
1925.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
that's
correct
your
honor.
in
this
phraseology,
no
break.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
can
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
can
only
answer
to
the
best
of
my
own
personal
knowledge
which
is
that
what
i
have
said
has
been
reviewed
by
the
parties
over
the
years
and
that
there
are
no
instances.
however,
(voice

--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
the
entire
period.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
the
entire
period.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i'm
just
answering
to
the
best
of
my
personal
knowledge,
your
honor
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
because
i
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
have
not
actually
been
in
the
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
that
that's
what
it
means.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
we
are
in
this
case
to
vouch
and
say
what
we
believe
the
contract
means.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
very
briefly,
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
fanciful
probability
theory
advanced
by
the
diehl
case.
now,
of
course
this
court
merely
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
matter
without
virtually
any
comment.
and
i
can't
find
the
slightest
basis
for
the
probability
rule.
number
one,
the
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
in
the
diehl
case,
a
man
was
a
car
man
helper
before
he
went
into
the
service,
he
became
a
temporary
car
men
mechanic.
while
he
was
on
the
service
it
was
decided
between
the
railroad
and
the
union
that
after
the
war
emergency
was
over,
then
at
that
juncture,
the
parties
would
determine
what
the
status
of
temporary
car
men
mechanics
would
be.
the
man
came
back
from
the
war.
he
was
again
made
a
temporary
car
man
mechanic
and
in
june
of
1956,
had
he
not
gone
in
the
service
he
would
have
served
1160
hours.
actually,
sometime
in
very
early
1949,
it
was
1160
days,
actually
in
early
1949,
he
did
complete
1160
actual
days.
and
about
two
months
later,
the
union
and
the
company
arrived
in
an
agreement
that
a
man
who
had
1160
days
of
experience
was
a
temporary
car
man
mechanic
would
then
be
placed
upon
the
permanent
roster,
a
--
an
absolute
right
conferred
by
that
contract.
the
only
thing
that
i
can
view
out
of
what
this
court
did
was
to
say
that
in
determining
the
1160
days
of
the
experience
that
the
time
that
he
spend
in
service
had
to
be
counted.
i
think
the
result
is
totally
consistent
with
the
fishgold
case
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
takes
us
up
into
the
celestial
atmosphere
of
creating
of
a
new
theory
of
reasonable
probability.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i'm
hardly
able
to
answer
you,
your
honor.
i
simply
don't
know
what
records
are
available
in
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
don't
know.
do
you
know
(inaudible)?
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
in
as
much,
does
that
answer
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
must
depart
from
the
record.
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
was
instructed
by
the
business
agent
or
the
group
to
go
down
to
muskogee
and
keep
the
court
from
getting
a
new
tangled
crazy
interpretation
of
this
agreement
that
hadn't
been
adopted
in
1925.[laughs]
that
was
situation.
but
i
--
i'm
not
able
to
answer
of
my
own
personal
knowledge
about
those
records.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
depart
from
that
subject
matter
and
bring
to
the
intention
of
the
court
several
matters
which
we
feel
would
compel
that
the
result
below
be
sustained
regardless
of
the
principal
issue
raised
by
mr.
clinton
and
with
the
railroad,
we
fairly
concur.
we
feel
that
over
and
above
that
issue,
the
district
court
below
like
jurisdiction
over
this
cause
at
all,
because
we
feel
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
petitioner's
claim,
lies
solely
and
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
under
the
railway
labor
act.
that
point
was
disregarded
by
the
trial
judge
and
was
rejected
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
that
it's
mandatory.
now,
we
point
out
first
that
if
this
case
were
to
go
to
trial,
the
trial
judge
would
have
to
take
the
agreement
between
the
parties.
he
would
have
to
construe
it
and
he
would
have
to
interpret
it.
he
would
have
to
determine
what
rule
1
meant.
he
would
have
to
read
it
in
light
of
the
other
rules
of
the
agreement.
he
would
have
to
determine
the
seniority
rights
of
this
man
if
he
had
any
or
he
would
have
to
determine
the
impact
upon
those
rights
of
other
provisions
of
the
agreement.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
function
is
vested
solely
and
exclusively
in
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
in
the
case
of
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
against
chicago
railroad
and
indiana
railroad
company,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
traced
in
some
detail,
the
history
of
the
railway
labor
act.
it
was
there
pointed
out
and
it's
true
that
that
act
represents
the
culmination
of
some
six
years
--
60
years
of
thoughtful
effort
on
the
part
of
the
railroads
and
the
unions
to
find
some
means
to
bring
about
stable
and
harmonious
labor
relations.
because
of
course
the
matter
of
uninterrupted
railroad
service
is
one
of
prime
importance
and
significance
to
the
american
people.
the
act
as
it
presently
exist
as
a
result
of
that
effort
and
there's
the
opinion
referred
to
a
moment
ago
pointed
out,
it
was
not
until
1934,
when
the
old
26
act
was
amended,
that
a
machinery
was
established
with
sufficiently
and
enforceability
to
consummate
the
desire
of
the
parties
for
harmonious
relations.
that
machinery
in
part
was
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
charged
with
the
duty
of
determining
disputes
between
the
carriers
and
the
unions
with
respect
to
interpretation
and
construction
of
the
contract
entered
into
an
extent
between
the
carriers
and
the
union.
there
has
been
a
considerable
amount
of
litigation
over
the
years
concerning
the
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
of
that
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
and
i
believe
that
this
court
and
really
all
courts
have
unqualifiedly
held
giving
proper
weight
to
the
language
of
the
statute
to
the
degree
of
expertise
possessed
by
the
board.
that
the
jurisdiction
of
that
board
to
determine
matters
of
interpretation
and
construction
in
railway
labor
contracts
is
exclusive,
said
that
in
the
slocum
against
delaware,
lackawanna
and
so
forth
case
where
you
said
we
hold
unqualifiedly.
we
hold
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
to
adjust
grievances
and
disputes
of
the
type
here
involved
is
exclusive.
and
there
are
a
plethora
of
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
and
by
the
courts
of
appeals
so
holding.
i
think
the
proposition
is
beyond
dispute.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
that's
correct,
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
was
about
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
was
about
to
modulate
over
to
that
subject
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
because
it's
critical
in
this
case
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
and
i
shall
do
that
immediately.
actually,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
have
a
not
too
dissimilar
problem
when
he
had
to
take
the
norris–la
guardia
act
on
one
hand
and
the
railway
labor
act
on
the
other
hand
and
try
to
put
the
two
together
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to.
now,
lets
consider,
here
we
--
its
true
enough,
we
have
two
statutorily
processes,
created
processes,
both
of
them
here
with
this
and
neither
statute
saying
one
word
about
the
other
statute.
now,
of
course
the
railway
labor
act
preceded
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act.
its
noteworthy
first
that
no
reference
of
any
nature
description
is
made
to
the
railway
labor
act
in
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act,
so
that
whatever
we
do
with
our
endeavoring
to
put
the
two
together
will
have
to
be
pretty
much
predicated
upon
inference
and
implication
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
--
i
have
arrived
independently
of
that
conclusion,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
that's
actually
try
--
quite
true.
but
now
let's
consider
the
common
sense
of
the
claim.
quite
patently,
here
you
have
a
railway
labor
act
which
sets
up
a
procedure
which
was
spelled
out
over
many
years
of
trial
and
error,
predicated
upon
the
need
for
finding
harmony
and
stability
in
labor
relations
and
an
industry
that
had
been
marked
by
a
lack
of
it.
and
then
finally
these
means
was
found
and
created.
now,
why?
because
there
are
special
unique
problems
in
the
railway
industry.
it
was
felt
that
in
order
to
resolve
them,
you
needed
a
specially
constituted
board
and
this
court
and
other
courts
have
commented
upon
that
subject
over
and
over.
now,
we
feel
that
viewing
all
of
the
factors,
the
intelligent
sound
thing
to
do
with
these
two
acts
to
put
them
together
and
this
court
has
never
ruled
upon
this
issue
and
no
other
court
in
my
opinion
has
seriously
consider
it.
the
only
way
to
put
those
two
together
as
i
see
it
is
to
keep
in
mind
now
that
universal
military
training
act
applies
to
all
service
men.
it's
--
it
covers
the
entire
industrial
area
of
activity
whereas
the
railway
labor
act
feels
with
unique
and
specific
special
problems.therefore
we
feel
that
if
you
have
a
railway
labor
act
matter
where
a
contract
interpretation
and
construction
matter
should
under
the
railway
labor
act
go
to
the
board.
then
we
feel,
that
the
impact
of
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act,
in
order
to
be
intelligently
coordinated
with
the
other
act,
should
simply
be
deferred
until
the
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
has
been
exhausted.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
there
isn't
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
no
question
about
it
under
the
stark
decision.
i
--
a
court
of
appeals
decision,
he
individually
or
the
union
on
his
behalf
could
--
could
go
there
as
i
construe
the
situation.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
i
can't
--
i
can't
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
in
the
ordinary
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
no,
that's
correct.
now,
i
couldn't
answer
the
question
as
to
what
they
would
do,
your
honor
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
but
the
union
feels
that
it
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
they
are
free
to
--
in
good
conscience
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
they
don't
feel
that
they
should
prosecute
non-meritorious
claims.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
but
now
let's
consider
what
will
happen
if
we
don't
construe
it
the
way
i
mentioned
it,
what
could
happen?
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
the
stark
case,
i
could
cite
that
to
the
court,
i
don't
have
it,
at
the
tip
my
tongue,
but
it
is
stark
again
some
railroad
which
it
so
held.
now,
supposing
we
don't
do
that.this
man
comes
in,
mckinney
comes
in
to
the
district
court
with
the
very
able
counsel
that
the
law
gives
him
and
he
prosecute
his
claim
and
this
court
interprets
and
construes
the
contract.
now,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
railroad
has
a
right
to
take
this
kind
of
dispute
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
it's
conceivable
at
that
level,
that
you
might
have
the
board
and
the
court
deciding
the
same
question
at
the
request
of
the
respective
parties.
well
now,
it
said
that
mr.
mckinney
had
won
his
suit
down
their
in
muskogee
and
if
he
is
entitled
to
the
job
that
mr.
fabian
had
and
fabian
can't
hold
the
same
job
that
mckinney
is
holding
so
the
railroad
has
to
say,
"mr.
fabian,
you'll
have
to
leave."
well
then,
mr.
fabian
has
a
perfect
right
to
go
up
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
under
this
agreement
or
maybe
the
brotherhood
on
his
behalf
or
someone
in
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
decides
the
same
issue
in
reverse
that
the
district
court
down
there
at
was
muskogee
decided,
and
maybe
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
might
feel
that
--
that
the
district
court
at
muskogee
was
wrong.
that
fabian
deserves
the
job
not
mckinney
and
so
they
might
entered
that
award
and
of
course
fabian
has
a
right
to
go
into
the
district
court
with
a
suit
for
statutory
enforcement.
and
he
is
entitled
to
a
prima
facie
weight
to
that
decision
and
maybe
he'd
win
that
case.
then
you'd
have
the
railroad
confronted
with
the
unique
situation
of
having
the
district
court
in
one
place
telling
that
mr.
fabian
should
have
job
x
and
the
district
court
in
another
place
telling
that
mr.
mckinney
should
have
job
x.
we
elaborate
somewhat
on
those
possibilities
in
our
brief
and
they
are
almost
endless.
now,
those
things
could
occur.
they
might
occur
here.
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
construing
the
acts
together,
not
viewing
one
as
impliedly
repealing
the
other
but
--
well,
i
think
its
probably
true
that
nobody
in
congress
thought
about
this
matter,
giving
proper
weight
to
the
railway
labor
act
on
one
hand,
and
serving
the
purpose
of
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
on
the
other
hand.
i
feel
the
construction
urged
upon
you
is
sound
and
that
under
that
construction
at
this
juncture,
the
district
court
at
muskogee
has
no
jurisdiction.
there
are
two
other
matters
that
i
would
like
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
but
i
think
i
might
shift
my
position
around
and
argue
the
point
i
intended
to
argue
last
because
i
think
it's
obvious
what
happened
here.
your
honors
will
note
that
this
man
came
back
in
1952
in
the
fall
and
it
indicates
the
he
requested
a
seniority
date
and
that
he
protested
when
he
didn't
get
it,
and
that's
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
he
requested
a
certain
seniority
date
and
that
he
protested
when
he
didn't
get
it.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
that's
back
in
1952.
then
the
--
now
that's
all
it's
says
about
the
relationship
with
the
employee
and
the
railroad.
then
a
year
later,
he
had
been
put
into
this
group
one
job
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
but
the
railroad
had
a
perfect
right
to
give
him
and
they
did
give
him.
and
he
served
in
that
job
for
a
year
and
so
far
as
the
complaint
reflects,
nothing
happened
during
that
year.
but
in
1953,
the
job
was
abolished
and
he
was
put
back
in
--
he
was
put
back
into
group
two
and
there
he
remained
until
the
summer
of
1955,
when
this
suit
was
filed.
i
think
the
reason,
if
there
is
a
reason
that
the
railway
didn't
even
think
about
that
is
that
--
and
that's
what
i'm
coming
to.
i
think
it's
crystal
clear
that
rights
can
be
waived
under
universal
military
training
and
service
act.
and
we
point
out
in
our
brief
certain
circumstances
under
which
they
are.
now
i
--
in
1952,
in
the
fall
of
1952,
this
plaintiff
knew
everything
he
was
ever
going
to
know
about
his
seniority
date,
and
he
waited
not
only
the
year
until
the
job
that
he
did
get,
which
was
above
the
one
he
had
left
was
abolished,
but
another
2
years
almost
before
he
filed
this
suit.
i
don't
think
that
that
kind
of
jurist
prudential
sandbagging
was
contemplated
in
under
this
universal
military
training
and
service
act
and
i
think
that
by
his
delay,
his
apparent
acquiescence,
this
man
waived
and
lost
his
right
to
proceed
under
this
act.
and
finally,
again
moving
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
--
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
no,
it
did
not,
it
did
not,
neither
court
below
mentioned
that
point.
the
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
it
wasn't
decided
on
that
basis
but
i
think
the
ground
was
meritorious,
mr.
justice
black.
finally,
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
raise
is
that
this
man
relies
upon
a
contract
as
i
see
it,
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
source
of
his
seniority
yet
he
does
not
invoke
the
contract.
there
are
elaborate
provisions
for
grievances
and
appeals
under
this
agreement
but
his
complaint
reflects
nothing
about
his
invoking
those.
we
feel
that
if
he
relies
upon
this
contract
or
his
rights,
his
seniority
that
he
can't
treat
the
contract
piecemeal
selecting
the
paragraphs
he
likes
and
disregarding
the
ones
he
doesn't
like.
we
feel
that
if
he
relies
upon
the
contract,
he
has
to
show
his
compliance
with
it
and
that
as
a
preliminary
to
have
any
right
anywhere,
he
had
to
proceed
through
the
appellate
and
grievance
procedures
of
the
contract
and
of
course
under
the
law
that
again
modulates
up
to
the
railway
labor
act
proceedings.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
i
--
i
perhaps
selected
waiver
over
latches
your
honor
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
i
simply
feel
that
when
he
took
the
group
one
--
he
--
he
--
its
true
he
says
he
protested
whatever
that
means,
i
don't
know.
but
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
--
it's
true
enough
that
--
that
he
says
he
protested.
nevertheless,
he
took
a
group
one
job
other
than
the
one
that
he
said
he
should
get,
did
nothing
for
a
whole
year
working
on
it,
then
nothing
is
now
written
in
the
complaint
about
any
further
activity,
was
moved
down
to
group
two
when
his
group
one
job
was
abolished
and
waited
a
two
years
then
to
do
anything
about.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
and
of
course
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
absolutely,
both
the
carrier,
the
carrier
was
lulled
into
feeling
that
it
had
him
in
the
right
job
and
it
had
this
other
employees
in
the
right
job
and
he
paid
everybody
accordingly.
the
brotherhood
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
he
didn't
--
well,
he
doesn't
allege
that
in
his
complaint.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
he
alleges
that
he
protested
and
that's
all
he
alleges.
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
well,
of
course
--
mr.
carroll
j.
donohue
all
that
the
complaint
says
is
that
he
protested.
it
doesn't
explain
it
anymore
than
that.
