mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
brings
before
the
court
an
action
by
mr.
mckinney,
an
honorably
discharged
veteran,
to
enforce
against
his
employer,
certain
re-employment
rights
assertedly
arising
under
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act
of
1951.
the
case
was
before
the
district
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
the
respondent
railroad
and
the
intervening
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks.
the
complaint
includes
a
copy
or
a
duplicate
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
brotherhood
and
the
employer
--
employing
railroad.
the
facts
as
set
out
in
the
complaint
and
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
bargaining
agreement
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
on
and
prior
to
september
25,
1950,
mckinney
was
employed
by
the
railroad
as
a
relief
clerk
chief
caller.
this
position
falls
within
group
3
of
the
three
group
classifications
of
employees
set
out
in
rule
1
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
on
september
25,
1950,
mr.
mckinney
left
his
employment
for
purposes
of
training
and
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
approximately
two
weeks
prior
to
his
discharge,
two
positions
in
the
respondent's
employment,
that
of
bill
clerk
and
that
of
assistant
cashier,
became
available
and
were
bulletined
or
advertised
on
september
8
and
10,
1952.
both
of
these
positions
came
within
group
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
the
record
merely
shows
that
these
--
these
positions
were
vacant,
the
--
whether
they
are
new
positions
or
as
a
result
of
discharge,
it
does
not
appear.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
prior
to
his
discharge
from
the
armed
forces,
that's
correct.
he
was
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
right.
advertised
on
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
petitioner
entered
the
armed
forces
on
september
25,
1950.
the
positions
were
bulletined
on
september
8
and
10
of
1952.
this
was
two
weeks
--
approximately
two
weeks
prior
to
his
discharge
from
the
armed
forces.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
came
back
to
work
or
he
resumed
his
employment
on
october
7th
of
1952.
both
these
positions
come
within
group
1
of
the
classification
of
positions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
general,
both
--
both
positions
represent
advancements
over
the
group
2
position
both
in
terms
of
the
desirability
of
the
work
and
in
terms
of
remuneration.
in
the
matter
of
filling
group
1
vacancies,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
rule
1
(3)
(a)
provides
that
group
2
employees
shall
be
entitled
to
preference
over
non-employees
based
upon
fitness
and
ability.
because
the
petitioner's
absence
in
the
armed
forces,
he
was
unable
to
make
application
for
either
or
both
of
these
positions
as
would
have
been
his
right
had
he
been
present.
in
fact,
both
positions
were
filled
by
non-employees.
upon
his
return
from
the
armed
forces,
he
made
his
application
for
re-employment
as
was
his
right
under
the
statute
and
was
in
fact
reemployed
and
resumed
his
employment
on
october
7
of
1952.
at
that
time,
he
was
permitted
to
displace
the
appointee
of
november
22,
that
is
the
non-employee
hired
to
fill
the
vacancy
in
the
assistant
cashier's
position.
he
was
given
a
seniority
date
in
this
group
1
position
of
october
7,
1952
and
he
immediately
protested
this
to
his
employer
claiming
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
earlier
seniority
date
of
either
september
8
or
10,
1952
when
the
two
positions
in
group
1
were
first
bulletined
or
advertised.
his
protest
to
the
employer
was
without
avail.
thereafter,
he
continued
in
--
to
occupy
the
position
of
assistant
cashier
until
september
of
1953.
at
this
time
or
in
september
2,
he
was
--
he
had
learned
that
the
position
of
assistant
cashier
was
in
the
process
of
abolishment.
he
requested
or
made
application
to
his
employer
that
he'd
be
permitted
under
the
--
under
rule
23
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
exercise
his
seniority
right
to
--
and
to
displace
the
bill
clerk
who,
at
that
time,
continued
to
be
the
appointee
of
the
--
preceding
september
15.
this
request
by
mr.
mckinney
was
likewise
denied
by
his
employer
solely
on
the
ground
that
--
with
the
seniority
date
of
october
7,
1952,
he
was
junior
to
the
incumbent
bill
clerk
and
therefore,
he
had
no
rights
to
bump
the
bill
clerk
under
the
bills
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it
depend,
i
think,
your
honor,
upon
whether
the
person
came
from
group
1
or
group
2.
if
the
position
had
been
filled
by
a
group
1
employee,
i
think
he
would
have
no
claim
to
the
position.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
from
the
same
group
as
he
was?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
his
right
in
those
circumstances,
i
think,
would
either
evolve
upon
--
or
turn
upon
a
matter
of
seniority,
exclusively
seniority.
now,
this,
i
say,
not
--
not
on
the
basis
of
any
rule
in
the
agreement
itself
but
the
--
the
general
provision
dealing
with
promotions
says
that
promotions
shall
be
based
upon
seniority,
fitness
and
ability.
so,
if
we
could
assume
that
the
two
group
--
two
--
two
group
to
employees
had
equal
fitness
and
ability,
then
in
no
circumstances,
i
think,
the
promotion
would
go
to
the
one
who
was
senior.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
the
employer
has
his
--
has
--
has
the
choice?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes,
but
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
has
he
based
the
promotion
upon
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
fitness
and
ability
are
factors
along
with
seniority
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
and
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
gives
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
to
the
employer
but
because
of
the
seniority
concept,
i
do
not
think
it
is
unbridled
or
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
in
the
matter
of
promotion,
yes.
and
in
this
case
or
in
this
particular
circumstance
where
you
have
a
group
2
employees
seeking
or
advancing
to
group
1,
it
is
not
cast
in
terms
of
promotion
but
a
preference
or
as
--
not
in
terms
of
seniority,
but
in
terms
of
a
preference
and
that
is
as
between
non-employees.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
positive
assurance,
i
suppose
not
but
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
the
allegation
in
the
compliant
is
that
he
is
entitled
to
this
seniority
date,
that
being
the
date
these
positions
were
first
bulletined.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
his
seniority
were
to
be
determined
strictly
on
the
basis
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
petitioner
here
would
have
no
complaint
whatsoever.
the
right
that
he
asserts,
his
seniority
right
that
he
has
asserts
here
arises
under
the
statute.
if
he
is
entitled
to
this
right
under
the
statute,
i
think,
the
fact
that
the
--
a
--
an
adherence
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
cannot
diminish
or
cutback
that
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
the
statute?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
the
statute
certainly,
section
9
(c)
(1)
provide
that
in
the
manner
of
restoring
a
veteran
to
his
former
employment,
he
is
entitled
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
to
be
restored
without
seniority.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
certainly
where
you
have
a
promotion
or
an
advancement
provision
in
the
bargaining
agreement
which
is
based
solely
upon
seniority.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
but
to
our
mind
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
it
--
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
say
to
our
mind,
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
the
petitioner's
position
of
assistant
cashier
was
abolished
on
september
5
of
1952
and
he
was,
at
that
time,
relegated
to
group
2
status
and
resumed
his
employment
as
a
relief
clerk
chief
caller.
besides
asserting
these
facts,
the
complaint
alleges,
of
course,
that
the
seniority
date
of
october
7
is
incorrect
and
that
a
seniority
date
of
september
8
or
10
is
the
correct
date
and
the
date
to
which
he
is
entitled.
he
asked
in
his
complaint
that
he'd
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
statute
in
this
particular
or
this
earlier
seniority
date.
and
if
he
is
correct
in
his
contention
in
this
respect,
he
is
entitled
to
be
a
senior
too,
the
incumbent
bill
clerk
and
was
entitled
to
displace
him
and
dissimilarly
under
the
statute,
entitled
to
compensation
for
his
loss
of
earnings
resulting
from
his
wrongful
demotion
to
group
2
status.
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
respondent's
motion
on
the
ground
that
it
fails
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
and
the
court's
view,
although
it
recognized
that
petitioner
would
have
or
would
probably
have
achieved
--
meet
one
status
on
the
earlier
dates,
it
was
out
of
the
view
in
that
sense.
the
status
that
he
claims
he
would
have
achieved
was
conditioned
and
the
terms
of
the
bargaining
agreement
upon
which
he
would
have
reached
the
group
1
status
or
positions
was
qualified
by
the
condition
of
fitness
and
ability.
he
could
not
--
he
could
not
be
said
that
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
the
status.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
must
be
considered
for
purposes
of
this
motion
to
dismiss.
if
there
were
any
question
as
to
his
fitness
or
ability,
i
think
it
should
be
appropriately
raised
by
answer.
i
don't
understand
that
either
respondent
in
this
case
questioned
the
fitness
of
the
--
or
ability
of
the
--
of
mckinney
either
at
the
time
the
position
were
bulletined
or
at
the
time
he
resumed
his
employment
on
october
7th.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
would
say
he
would
have
the
right
only
if
there
were
some
question
as
to
his
fitness
or
ability.
if
he
--
if
he
did
not
have
the
fitness
or
ability
to
discharge
the
responsibility
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
a
suggestion
i
suppose
is
that
because
of
this
qualifications,
the
employer
has
the
complete
discretion
in
naming
the
employees.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
do.
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
let
me
say
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
i
think
that
the
--
the
procedure
would
be
to
invoke
the
grievance
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
procedure
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
do
contest
that
that
is
the
sole
basis
upon
which
an
employee
may
be
restored
to
his
--
to
a
status
in
his
employment
that
he
assertedly
would
have
received
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think,
if
i
may
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
--
a
reasonable
approach
or
a
reasonable
requirement
to
impose
upon
the
veteran
is
that
he'd
be
able
to
show
that
as
a
reasonable
probability
or
with
reasonable
certainty
that
he
was
obtained
a
given
status
or
a
given
position
had
he
been
in
the
continuous
employee
of
the
railroad.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that
it
does.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that
it
does.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
do
not
real
--
rule
those
out.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
--
if
there
are
rights
under
the
agreement,
it
is
a
very
simple
case.
but
if
they
are
in
the
area
where
you
cannot
reduce
it
to
an
absolute
rights
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
must
be
given,
i
would
say,
the
opportunity
to
show
that
as
a
reasonable
probability,
he
would
have
obtained
a
given
status
or
position
as
of
a
reasonably
certain
date
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
is
the
least
that
he
is
entitled
to
in
the
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
it
is
turn
--
it
is
a
preference
in
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
certainly
on
that
point
that
he
is
entitled
to
go
to
trial
court.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
and
let
the
--
let
the
appointing
official
come
in
and
testify
as
to
what
he
would
have
done
had
the
--
that
had
been
present
as
between
the
veteran
and
the
two
non-employees
who
were
hired
to
fill
these
vacancies.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
oh,
no.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
now,
certainly
that
is
--
that
is
true.
but
he
also
alleges
that
the
seniority
date
that
he
was
given,
that
is
october
7th,
is
in
error
or
incorrect.
now,
the
correct
seniority
date
is
september
8
or
10.
that
is
the
--
the
gist
of
his
complaint
here
that
he
has
been
denied
the
seniority
date
that
he
would
have
received
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is
--
if
there
is
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes,
i
agree,
mr.
justice
whitaker.
i
think
that
whether
--
if
there
is
not
an
expressed
allegation
in
this
complaint
that
he
would
have
obtained
or
he
would
have
received
the
appointments
there,
i
think
it
is
a
certainly
a
fair
inference
or
reasonable
inference
and
he
could
very
well
be
in
--
and
he
could
very
well
indulge
the
veteran
that
--
at
this
point
particularly
where
the
only
predicates
for
the
september
8
or
10
date
would
be
that
he
had
--
he
would
have
obtained
though
the
--
those
positions
had
he
been
present
at
the
time.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
say,
would
confine
the
--
the
benefit,
the
seniority
benefit
conferred
by
section
9
(c)
(1)
and
by
--
and
considered
together
with
section
9
(c)
(2)
to
those
instances
where
the
advanced
position
or
the
advanced
status
would
have
been
obtained
as
a
matter
of
absolute
right.
and
i
think
we
should
note
too
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
in
connection
with
this
rule
1
(3)
(a)
that
had
the
veteran
been
present,
he
could
have
demanded
the
group
1
positions
after
his
qualifications
or
his
fitness
and
ability
had
been
determined.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
reasonable
probability.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
the
pertinent
provision,
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
would
be
rule
31
of
the
agreement
on
page
9.
any
employee
who
considers
himself
otherwise
unjustly
treated
shall
be
--
have
the
same
rights
as
employees
subject
to
disciplinary
action.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
rule
31.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
he
were
enforcing
a
right
arising
under
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act,
he
would
not,
in
our
view.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
would
not.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
i
may
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
in
this
case
we
have
i
think
no
question
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
might
have
exercised
any
discretion
that
he
might
have
had
with
respect
to
a
promotion
or
to
the
preferential
right
to
this
petitioner
would
have
been
entitled
to
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
i
emphasize
that
here,
the
employer
has,
if
he
had
discretion
or
complete
discretion,
exercised
it
by
placing
petitioner
in
the
group
one
position
of
assistant
cashier
and
permitting
him
to
displace
the
nonemployee
incumbent
and
--
in
that
position.
he
seeks
here
a
seniority
date
in
the
group
one
status
that
he
would
have
had
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
i
said
that.
i
think
what
i
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
what
i
intended
to
say
if
i
didn't
say
is
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
a
trial.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no.
i
say
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
been
appointed
to
this
position.
now,
what
he
is
entitled
to
a
trial
on
is
the
issue
as
to
what
date
he
would
probably
have
obtained
this
position
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
and
that
for
purposes
of
determining
the
seniority
date
which
we
think
he
is
entitled
to
in
the
group
one
status.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no,
i
think
not
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
not.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
asked
for
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
oh,
i
think
so
because
of
the
statute,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
if
the
--
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
inconsistent
with
the
benefit
or
contrary
to
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
act
then
he
can
get
more.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
if
that
were
the
case
in
all
instances,
in
this
case
he
would
have
no
case
because
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says
that
seniority
commences
on
the
day
that
the
pay
commences
in
the
group
in
which
he
is
employed.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
don't
think
he
gets
anymore
than
he
would
have
had
in
this
case
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
measures,
the
primary
measure.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
and
i
--
when
i
say
in
that
primarily
i
think
that
in
many
instances
the
rights
that
he
has
may
arise
out
of
the
custom
and
practice
of
the
employer.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
is
right
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
if
it
is
inconsistent
or
denies
to
the
veteran
the
seniority
benefit
that
he
would
have
had
--
or
that
he
would
have
or
is
entitled
to
under
the
statute,
then
you
look
to
the
statute.
and
of
course
that
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
we
--
we
are
of
the
view
that
he
may
--
if
there
is
a
denials
of
the
benefit
or
a
refusal
to
comply
with
the
benefit
to
which
he
is
entitled
under
the
statute
then
his
remedy
is
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
his
right
to
the
earlier
seniority
date
here
is
predicated
of
course
upon
the
escalator
principles
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
prior
decisions
arising
under
the
selective
service
and
training
act
of
1940.
the
so-called
escalator
principle
has
now
we
think
been
codified
into
section
9
(c)
(2)
of
the
present
act.
we
think
that
there
is
no
longer
room
to
question
or
doubt
that
an
honorably
discharged
veteran
is
entitled
to
the
status
in
his
employment
and
a
seniority
date
in
the
status
that
he
would
have
had
had,
had
he
been
continually
employed.
and
we
think
that
by
permitting
petitioner
to
assume
the
group
one
position
of
assistant
cashier,
the
employer
in
this
case
has
implicitly
recognized
either
his
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
the
statute
or
both.
what
he
asked
now
is
that
this
seniority
date
in
that
position
be
made
retroactive
to
september
8
or
10
of
1952.
now,
the
diehl
case
by
this
court
we
think
is
dispositive
of
his
right
to
this
additional
benefit.
there,
the
court
will
recall,
the
veteran
returned
from
his
service
and
resumed
his
private
employment.
he
was
thereafter
given
an
advanced
status
in
the
employment
and
he
brought
suit
to
obtain
a
seniority
standard
--
seniority
standard
on
the
seniority
roster
in
the
advanced
position
that
he
allegedly
would
have
had
had
even
continued
--
have
been
continuously
in
his
employment.
the
court
will
call
the
holding
in
that
case
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
was
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
earlier
seniority
date
in
the
advanced
position.
now,
since
the
diehl
case
have
been
two
courts
of
appeals
which
have
looked
upon
the
diehl
decision
as
dispositive
of
both
the
question
of
whether
a
veteran
is
entitled
to
the
advanced
status
that
he
would
have
had
had,
had
even
continuously
employed.
and
whether
he
is
entitled
to
a
seniority
standing
in
that
advanced
status
that
he
would
have
had
or
would
probably
have
had
had
he
been
continually
employed.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case
did
not
so
much
as
referred
to
the
diehl
case.
instead
we
think
that
it
has
adopted
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
perhaps
entitled
is
not
the
best
word.he
probably
have
had
or
obtained.
i
say
that
because
--
i
mean,
i
deal
in
terms
of
probability
because
i
don't
think
you
can
ever
determine
with
any
degree
of
certainty
or
positiveness
what
status
a
particular
veteran
would
have
achieved
in
his
private
employment
had
he
been
there.
you
are
reconstructing
the
past
and
i
don't
think
you
can
do
it
in
a
degree
or
any
more
than
a
reliable
degree
of
certainty.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
here
of
course
he
--
we
tie
it
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
he
was
entitled
to
apply
for
this
position
or
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
apply
for
this
position.
and
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
preference
over
the
nonemployees
who
were
actually
hired
in
his
absence.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
is
seeking
to
enforce
a
statutory
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that
he
is
entitled
to
be
restored
without
loss
of
seniority.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
to
this
extent
if
he
is
asserting
a
statutory
right,
that
he
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
put
in
the
position
he
would
have
been
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
section
9
(d)
of
the
statute
which
gives
to
the
employee
who
is
denied
or
is
refused
the
benefits
to
which
he
is
entitled
under
the
act,
the
right
to
go
to
district
court
to
compel
compliance
with
the
act.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
no.
i
respectfully
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
a
fixed
rate
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
in
the
ordinary
situation
perhaps.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
no.
he
--
the
employer
has
made
his
choice
here,
we
say.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
there's
no
problem
we
think
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
seniority
date
in
the
advanced
position
which
the
--
the
employer
has
either
voluntarily
or
compulsory
given
him.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
the
seniority
will
not
depend
upon
the
--
the
employer's
choice.
this
--
the
seniority,
the
retroactive
seniority
date
depends
upon
the
statute.
they
rest
upon
the
statute.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
we
think
that
the
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
has
applied
in
this
case
is
unduly
restrictive
and
places
an
unwarranted
or
an
over
exacting
burden
upon
the
returning
veteran.
as
i've
said,
i
think
the
most
that
should
be
expected
of
the
veteran
is
that
he
be
able
to
show
as
a
reasonable
probability
the
status
that
he
has
obtained
upon
his
return
from
service
would
have
been
acquired
at
an
earlier
date
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
this
we
think
was
born
out
by
the
cases
the
courts
of
--
coming
from
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuit
subsequent
to
the
diehl
case
and
is
also
born
out
by
at
least
two
district
court
decisions.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
to
refuse
the
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
here,
i
think
the
evidence
should
--
should
be
directed
to
the
point
or
the
date
upon
which
he
would
probably
have
obtained
group
one
status.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
because
we
think
that
the
--
any
issue
as
to
his
fitness
and
ability
was
resolved
upon
his
being
permitted
or
being
assigned
to
the
group
one
position
upon
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
on
october
7
when
he
returned
from
the
service.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
1950
--
1940
--
1952
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
one
was
appointed
on
the
15th
and
of
september
1952
and
the
other
on
the
22nd
of
september
1952.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
makes
it
much
easier
that
you
have
a
very
short
time
as
here
and
that
certainly
is
to
me
persuasive
evidence
of
the
status
that
he
would
have
obtained
and
of
the
date
that
he
would
have
obtained
the
group
one
standing
had
he
been
continuously
employed.
as
a
say,
the
absolute
right
test
seemingly
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
is
an
over
exacting
burden,
places
an
over
exacting
burden
upon
the
veteran.
and
if
this
were
the
proper
test
or
criterion
for
the
application
on
the
escalator
principle
or
the
continuous
employment
test
it
would
i
think
necessarily
have
led
to
an
opposite
result
in
the
diehl
case
and
in
the
mann
v.crowell-collier
publishing
company
case
coming
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
from
the
morris
v.chesapeake
&
ohio
railroad
case
coming
from
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
was
--
how
--
how
did
mr.
mckinney
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
so
far
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it
hadn't
been
vacant,
he
bumped
it,
the
appointee
of
september
22
out
of
the
position.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
and
put
him
in.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
in
terms
of
dollars
and
cents?
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
$10,
there's
a
difference
between
the
group
one
position
which
he
claimed
he
is
entitled
to
and
that
of
the
position
which
he
has
occupied
since
his
demotion
is
$10.08
per
week.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
it's
been
--
he
was
demoted
in
september
--
on
september
5
of
1953,
were
going
into
the
fourth,
fifth
year
now.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
$10.08
per
week,
he
had
been
in
the
group
two
status
since
september
5
of
1953.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
there
is
that
difference
between
the
dates
that
he
would
have
obtained
group
one
status
and
the
date
that
he
actually
obtained
it,
but
he
was
demoted
mr.
justice
black
from
his
group
two
or
group
one
position
on
september
5
of
1953.
he
only
occupied
that
position
for
approximately
one
year
then
it
was
abolished.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
he
is
back
in
group
two.
so
if
he
were
--
or
if
he
was
wrongfully
demoted
he
is
entitled
to
compensation
for
--
there's
a
difference
between
the
two
positions
for
the
period
of
his
wrongful
demotion
until
he
is
restored
to
his
group
one
status.
i
thought
that
was
the
--
the
subject
of
your
inquiry.
i'll
reserve
such
time
as
i
have
remaining.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
respondent
suggests
that
the
preference
to
which
a
group
two
employee
is
entitled
to
over
a
nonemployee
amounts
ignoble,
apparently,
because
of
this
fitness
and
ability
qualification.
it
would
also
point
out
in
that
connection
that
rule
5
of
the
agreement
which
governs
all
promotions,
mind
you,
has
a
similar
qualification
with
the
additional
provision
that
fitness
and
ability
being
equal
seniority
shall
prevail.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
practice
of
the
interpretation
of
this
agreement
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
but
i
do
know
that
this
sufficiency
and
ability
of
this
fitness
and
ability
provision
is
a
common
one
in
the
hundreds
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
railroads
and
the
brotherhood.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
rule
5
is
not
printed
in
the
printed
record.
you'll
find
that
in
the
--
in
the
record
in
this
court,
that
is
a
complete
agreement,
is
a
part
of
the
record,
this
particular
rule
was
not
printed.
i
think
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
preference
and
perforce
the
promotional
right
as
embodied
in
rule
5,
means
anything
or
nothing
that
is
a
matter
that
should
properly
be
develop
by
testimony
or
by
evidence
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
say
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
as
to
the
--
i
presume
this
is
directed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that
for
17
years,
the
courts
have
been
passing
upon
questions
not
unrelated
to
the
very
one
we
have
here.
no
court
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
so
much
as
suggested
or
held
that
there
is
any
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
to
enforce
the
requirements
of
this
act.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
have
that
been
a
--
been
pursued
in
this
case,
i
think
it
might
be
well
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
stay
its
hand
awaiting
the
outcome
of
the
grievance
procedure.
but
i
should
say
also
that
section
9
(d)
provides
that
cases
of
this
character
be
advanced
on
the
calendar,
and
be
disposed
of
as
expeditiously
as
possible.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
well,
it's
in
our
brief
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
it's
a
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
--
that
it's
here.
we
have
as
much
as
anything,
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
application.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
may
i
say
that
--
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
i
think
that's
quite
correct,
that
you
must
refer
to
the
agreement
of
course
to
determine
the
date
and
the
time
or
not
only
to
the
agreement
but
to
the
events
this
transpired
in
the
serviceman's
absence
in
order
to
ascertain
the
date
upon
which
he
would
have
to
received
the
advancement.
of
course
two
cases
have
already
been
in
this
court,
that
is
the
oakley
case
and
the
diehl
case
which
if
the
jurisdictional
infirmity
which
respondent
suggest
and
here
as
in
this
case
were
through
--
were
present,
would
also
had
been
present
there.
and
there's
not
so
much
as
a
suggestion
in
the
briefs
filed
either
those
cases
that
there
was
any
jurisdictional
problem.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
again
mr.
justice
black,
i
suggest
we
don't
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
because
we
have
the
instance
where
has
been
given
to
very
positions
that
he
wanted.
now,
if
you
were
asking
that
he'd
be
advanced
to
group
one
status,
as
an
initial
proposition,
then
you
might
have
that
problem.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
well,
i
--
my
answer
to
that
would
be
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
that
should
be
developed
on
trial.
if
that
is
in
fact
what
they
did,
let
them
come
in
and
the
court
will
prove
it.
mr.
john
g.
laughlin,
jr.
yes.
it
--
in
any
event
that
would
be
our
position.
