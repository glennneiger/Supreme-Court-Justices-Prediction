what
would
be
the
line
of
evidence
that
he
could
--
he
would
put
up
in
the
line
of
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
to
put
up
to
refuse
it.
justice

that
is
the
state

justice

black
what
line
of
evidence
would

was
he
assigned
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
the
service
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
was
the
date
when
the
other
man
gets
the
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
was
appointed
in
which
time
was
so
short
between
those
dates
that
it's
easy
to
see
and
to
determine
and
automatically
follows
that
he
would
have
gotten
the
promotion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
he
ever
--
to
get
promoted
in
that
so
short
of
time
after
the
other
man
got
his
promotion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
curious
--
i'm
just
curious
as
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
can
tell
me
about
--
they
put
somebody
in
this
place
that
he
was
entitled,
he
would
have
been
entitled
had
he
been
--
but
in
october,
he
came
back
and
they
put
him
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
--
what
change
had
occur
that's
led
--
made
to
make
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
put
him
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
involved
in
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
how
many
weeks
are
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
get
that,
in
both
of
those
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
there's
only
a
difference
between
september
and
october
of
1952
according
to
your
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
requested
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
september?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
decided
on
that
basis,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
below
didn't
decide
it
on
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
it
could
be
decided
on
that
basis
certainly
on
the
fact
that
the
complaint
was
dismissed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
rule
5?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
this
idea
that
has
to
be
protested
in
the
board
(inaudible)
a
special
board
rather
than
a
court
to
determine
what
the
contract
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
to
that
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
supposed
it
has
jurisdiction,
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
that
it
should
stay
its
hand
until
the
board
provided
for
any
act
to
interpret
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
9
--
9
(d)
is
not
printed
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
part
of
the
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
aside
from
that,
the
--
(inaudible)
as
well
as
the
claim,
the
contract
does
not
give
any
right,
you
claim
it
does.
assuming
the
district
court
has
full
jurisdiction,
who
should
decide
where
the
contract
does
or
does
not
give
the
rights
alleged?
the
district
court
without
calling
on
the
board
or
should
it
(inaudible)
and
let
the
board
decide
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
supposed
you
say
do
you
not
that
whether
the
district
court
or
board
does
not
as
long
as
they
dismiss
the
complaint.
