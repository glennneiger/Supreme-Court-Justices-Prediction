mr.
laughlin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin,
may
i
ask
this?
supposed
they
had
given
this
job
to
another
person
while
he
was
in
the
service,
would
he
have
had
any
right
to
demand
that
position
when
he
got
out
of
the
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
say
it
was
from
the
same
group
that
he
was
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
have
you
the
right
to
assume
that
if
--
if
the
employer
has
the
choice
and
has
the
right
to
--
to
base
his
promotion
on
--
on
fitness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
has
the
right
to
base
the
promotion
upon
fitness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
he
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
does
the
employer
have
the
right
in
this
case
to
base
the
promotion
upon
fitness
for
the
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
does
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
not
mean
choice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin,
the
only
thing
i
want
to
get
straight
from
my
mind
is
this.
is
there
any
difference
in
the
position
of
--
of
one
--
of
two
veterans,
one
of
whom
is
working
under
conditions
where
promotion
comes
automatically
merely
by
reason
of
seniority?
and
in
the
case
of
the
other
one,
there
is
an
intervening
factor
where
the
employer
has
a
right
to
determine
the
fitness
of
a
man
to
the
job
and
--
and
therefore
gives
the
employer
some
discretion
as
--
as
i
understood
was
the
situation
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
statute
now.
i'm
not
--
let's
try
to
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
bargaining
agreement
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
laughlin,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
where
you
say
that
to
which
he
was
entitled
or
probably
would
have
been
to
which
he
have
been
entitled,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
the
thing
that
still
disturb
me
is
whether
that
probability
depends
upon
the
question
is
to
whether
the
employer
would
consider
him
to
be
qualified
for
the
promotion.
is
that
--
is
that
the
thing
that
the
--
that
--
of
course
you
say
or
probably
would
namely
that
the
employer
probably
would
have
concern
him
to
--
to
have
been
qualified
for
it
and
therefore
would
have
appointed
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
clinton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
clinton,
under
your
collective
bargaining
agreement,
suppose
there
were
a
number
of
employees
that
the
employer
considered
fit
and
qualified
for
this
particular
job
but
suppose
he
had
in
his
own
mind
the
degrees
of
fitness,
did
he
have
the
right
to
select
those
for
one
--
the
one
whom
we
thought
was
disqualified
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
--
yes.
or
did
he
--
or
was
he
obliged
to
take
the
senior
one
in
the
group
that
he
considered
fit
and
qualified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donohue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
man
have
--
have
access
to
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
independently
on
this
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
--
you
get
those,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
the
railroad
company
and
the
interest
of
uniformity
and
the
informality
did
not
take
this
the
--
to
the
board?
i
would
think
that
they
were
much
rather
have
those
things
determined
before
the
board
then
before
the
district
court
and
i
wonder
--
i
just
wondered
why
they
didn't
do
it?

justice

warren

laughlin.
