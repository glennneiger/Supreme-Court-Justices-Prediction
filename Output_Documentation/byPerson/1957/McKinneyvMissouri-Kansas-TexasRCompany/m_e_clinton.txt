mr.
m.
e.
clinton
as
counsel
stated
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
--
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
correctness
of
the
ruling
is
to
be
determined
by
the
pleading
rather
than
by
statement
which
may
had
been
made
which
go
beyond
the
pleading.
we
do
not
think
that
this
gentleman
filed
a
cause
of
action.
he
did
not
allege
that
there
was
a
test
or
a
question
of
his
fitness
and
ability
raised
and
upon
that
issue
the
company
decided
that
he
was
fit
and
able
and
therefore
gave
him
this
job.
the
pleading
does
not
recite
why
or
under
what
circumstances
that
was
done.
in
our
brief,
a
statement
is
made
that
he
was
given
this
assistant
cashier
job
on
--
as
of
october
7,
1952
through
a
mistake
of
law.
and
that
therefore
we
have
the
right
to
correct
it
when
the
circumstances
arise
such
as
force
reduction
and
the
matter
was
brought
to
our
attention
again
and
we
do
correct
it.
if
it
were
--
has
a
mistake
of
law,
it
could
have
arisen
as
counsel
said,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
true
or
not.
but
he
said
that
the
man
was
permitted
to
bump
the
man
off
of
the
assistant
cashier's
job.
well,
if
that's
what
happened,
it
would
be
a
mistake
of
law
because
he
could
only
bump
the
man
if
he
had
seniority
in
group
one
which
he
didn't
have
at
the
time
the
bump
had
took
place.
so
if
he
bumped
the
man
it
was
a
mistake
of
law
and
contrary
to
the
contract
itself
which
requires
that
bumping
can
be
done
only
in
the
exercise
of
seniority
in
the
group
in
which
the
position
is
located.
we'd
like
to
state
that
this
man
has
now
the
exact
position
which
he
had
when
he
entered
military
service.
he
has
now
the
exact
date
in
that
position
which
he
had
when
he
was
in
military
service.he
has
not
been
deprived
of
any
seniority.
and
as
in
the
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
gave
him
any
greater
right
than
the
contract
it
itself,
the
statute
itself,
section
9
(c)
(1)
and
the
preceding
section
does
not
undertake
to
give
a
man
in
so
many
words
a
promotion
right.
neither
does
9
(c)
(2)
using
as
such
or
as
to
this
language.
now,
the
statute
therefore
on
its
face
does
not
give
it.
and
we
do
no
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
show
us
that
he
was
entitled
to
it
either
because
senate
bill
2655
was
introduced
in
the
1940
--
in
1948.
house
bill
6401
was
introduced.
the
senate
bill
was
substantially
the
same
in
respect
to
this
face
of
the
law
as
the
1940
act.
the
house
bill
went
on
the
say
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
promotional
rights,
the
promotions
to
which
he
might
have
had
if
you
had
remained
in
the
service
and
had
not
joined
the
army.
when
the
senate
bill
was
passed
and
went
to
the
house,
the
house
amended
the
senate
bill,
was
striking
out
everything
except
the
enacting
clause
and
setting
out
the
house
bill
as
an
amendment
of
the
senate
bill.
and
it
went
to
conference
and
as
a
result
of
that
conference
the
--
they
came
out
with
a
bill
reinstating
in
effect
the
senate
provisions
in
eliminating
the
house
provision
about
the
man
being
entitled
to
such
promotions
as
he
might
have
had
had
he
remained
in
the
company's
employ.
now
therefore,
under
the
statute
by
its
expressed
language
and
not
of
the
legislative
history,
he
is
not
entitled
to
what
he
seeks.
if
he
is
entitled
to
what
he
seeks
he
must
get
it
by
virtue
of
the
collective
agreement.
answering
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
of
course
the
statute
does
not
give
him
any
greater
rights
than
he
had
at
the
time
he
entered
the
service
as
spelled
out
in
the
agreement.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
he
has
such
a
right
under
the
collective
procedure
because
i
think
section
1
(3)
(a)
where
it
says
that
a
group
two
employee
will
be
given
preference
in
filling
a
group
one
position
based
upon
fitness
and
ability.
i
think
that
that
is
solely
within
the
discretion
of
the
employer.
the
question
of
fitness
and
ability
is
not
subject
to
review
by
any
board
or
anyone
else.
and
you
can
imagine
the
chaos
which
would
result
in
any
industry
if
after
some
four
or
five
years,
thousands
among
people
--
a
thousand
among
people
could
go
back
and
say
that
if
i
had
been
here,
i
would
have
asked
for
this
job.
how
do
we
know
he
would
have
asked
for
it?
there's
nothing
in
his
complaints
stating
that
if
he
had
been
here
he
would
ask
for
it.
it
only
says
that
he
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
ask
but
there's
no
allegation
that
he
would
have
asked
even.
how
do
we
know
he
would
have
asked?
there
were
people
on
group
two
positions
that
didn't
ask,
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
have
people
in
group
two
pass
by
bulletin
position
in
another
district.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
the
employer?
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
he
can
take
anyone
he
wanted
to
and
the
fact
that
one
might
have
a
rate
of
seniority
than
another
in
group
two
has
nothing
to
do
whether
--
who
gets
the
position
in
group
one.
it's
discretionary
entirely
and
based
on
fitness
and
ability,
seniority
in
group
two
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
there's
another
bit
of
legislate
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
well,
that
be
rather
an
extreme
case.
it
may
be
that
if
he
can
prove
that
an
employer
didn't
even
consider
it
at
all
--
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
it
might
to
have
that
variation.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
i
don't
think
they
would.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
sir.
because
there's
nothing
in
the
collective
agreement
which
requires
the
employer
to
take
the
oldest
or
the
man
having
most
seniority
in
group
two
in
filing
a
position
in
group
one.
there's
nothing
in
the
agreement
about
it.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
not
so
far
as
going
from
one
seniority
group
to
another.
you
see,
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
person,
of
several
people
in
one
seniority
group
and
the
person
maybe
entitled
to
another
position
in
that
group.
this
man
is
going
from
group
two
which
is
a
separate
seniority
district
and
so
declared
to
be
by
the
agreement.
the
agreement
says
that
each
one
of
these
groups
have
there
own
seniority.
so
whether
or
not
they'll
permit
a
group
two
man
to
go
to
group
one
is
not
necessarily
and
is
not
dependent
upon
his
seniority
in
group
two.
it's
like
a
fireman
going
to
be
an
engineer
or
a
break
man
going
to
conduct.
the
agreement
does
not
require
that.
i
forgot
to
mention
that
little
legislative
history
about
this
nine
day.
now,
this
gentleman
claims
--
counsel
claims
that
he
gets
some
right
under
9
(c)
(2).
well
9
(c)
(2)
by
its
very
terms
does
not
give
him
this
right
but
furthermore
that
merely
says
that
it
is
the
intents
of
congress
or
intent
of
congress
that
certain
thing
shall
be
done.
it's
precatory,
is
not
mandatory.
and
furthermore
in
1956
--
furthermore
in
9
(d),
conferring
upon
the
federal
court's
authority
to
enforce
portions
of
this
act,
they
expressly
omit
9
(c)
(2).
he
referred
to
subsection
(b)
and
subsection
9
(c)
(1)
and
now
(g).
in
1956
(g)
was
added.
and
when
it
was
added
in
1956,
the
senate
bill
3307
was
introduced
under
which
if
it
had
been
adopted,
this
section
would
have
been
amended
and
9
(d)
to
read
that
the
federal
courts
could
enforce
any
rights
under
this
section
which
would
included
9
(c)
(2)
and
everything
else.
but
the
senate
committee
report
on
that
bill
came
back
and
they
only
put
(g)
in,
because
they
said
in
plain
english
that
otherwise,
it
would
confer
upon
the
federal
courts
the
right
to
enforce
all
of
section
9
and
that
was
not
intended.
now,
that
is
not
in
our
brief.
it's
something
we
developed
since.
and
i
can
--
if
the
court
will
permit
i'd
like
to
follow
just
a
brief
memorandum
of
the
citation
and
give
it
to
opposing
counsel.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
so
we
say
that
a
--
furthermore,
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
we
know
of
that
covers
the
situation
of
this
kind.
certainly,
we
say
we
complied
with
the
fishgold
case.
we've
given
the
man
what
he
had.he
is
back
on
the
escalator
where
he
was,
same
job,
same
seniority
date.
the
oakley
versus
the
l-n
case,
merely
held
in
effect
that
they
didn't
give
a
man
the
--
he
is
--
he's
already
in
the
job
before
he
went
to
military
service,
no
question
about
him
moving
into
--
after
he
got
back,
he
was
already
there.
they
said
they
didn't
give
him
his
right
date
but
he
didn't
make
any
difference
because
a
year
has
expired
and
his
rights
were
cut
off
because
that
--
that
isn't
true.
his
seniority
rights
go
beyond
a
year.
and
the
diehl
case,
why
that
is
--
doesn't
dispose
of
this
case
because
there,
there
was
a
contract
provision
which
said
that
if
a
man,
or
when
a
man
had
worked
a
1160
hours
in
a
certain
capacity,
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
elect,
whether
he
would
take
this
position
or
that
position.
and
furthermore,
before
the
agreement
itself
was
made,
this
man
in
fact
had
worked
1160
hours.
the
question
there
was,
though
whether
or
not
while
he
was
in
military
service,
his
time
should
have
been
computed
more
than
1160
and
to
say
that
that
case
controls
this,
well,
it's
a
little
absurd.
mr.
m.
e.
clinton
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
very
--
well,
except
as
we
do
not
admit
there's
no
question
about
fitness
and
ability
(inaudible)
there's
no
allegation
to
that
effect.
