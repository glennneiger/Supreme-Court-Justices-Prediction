mr.
james
c.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
c.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
no,
sir.
i
do
not
agree.
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
yes
or
no
to
that
question
because
that's
a
question
of
common
law,
and
that
the
law
of
contracts
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
of
the
answers
in
that
area.
and
i
don't
think
they're
necessarily
relevant
or
applicable
to
questions
of
labor
law
in
this
area
so
that
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
that
--
that's
all
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
right
sir,
i
wanted
to
answer
that
and
their
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
i
would
like
to
answer
preliminary
to
starting
on
my
argument
i'd
like
to
answer
two
or
three
of
the
general
questions
which
where
asked
mr.
manoli
on
argument
because
it
maybe
helpful
while
they're
fresh
in
the
court's
mind,
on
this
question
of
how
unions
describe
themselves
and
how
they
are
accustomed
to
describe
themselves.
at
pages
43
to
45
of
the
brief,
we
have
made
reference
to
contract
clauses
in
the
b
and
a
of
that
sort
of
thing
and
as
some
of
the
court
well
know
there
are
some
unions
that
do
it
one
way
and
some
another.
the
steel
workers
insist
no
matter
how
certified
if
possible
that
their
contracts
be
with
the
international's.
the
teamsters
insist
no
matter
how
they're
certified
that
the
contracts
be
with
the
local
or
perhaps
--
perhaps
with
the
district
representative.
this
particular
union
in
this
case
is
versatile
and
as
the
record
shows
there
are
in
the
record
attached
copies
of
their
contracts.
sometimes
they
sign
as
the
international,
sometimes
as
the
local,
sometimes
as
both.
so
that
very
clearly
this
question
of
the
way
in
which
a
union
will
be
identified
in
the
contract
has
been
in
varying
ways
the
subject
of
bargaining
and
the
subject
of
contracting
in
this
area.
now,
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
well
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
takes
me
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
to
the
core
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
of
my
argument
but
i
will
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
no
i
--
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
is
that
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
initially
because
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
that
that's
the
key
to
this
thing.
i
think
that
this
recognition
question
and
the
bargaining
question
has
been
given
by
both
the
board
and
the
counsel
here
and
some
what
the
lower
courts
a
--
an
ad
hoc
treatment
in
each
case
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
court
or
the
board
has
yet
reached
down
to
the
fundamentals
of
this
case.
now,
there
is
no
question
but
what
we
are
obligated
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
the
statutory
definition
of
bargaining
means
that
we
must
meet
and
confer
with
the
union
in
good
faith
as
the
exclusive
representative
of
our
employees.
the
statute
says
not
one
word
about
the
name
in
which
the
union
may
identify
itself
in
the
contract.
we
can't
refuse
to
bargain,
we
can't
pick
and
choose
what
we
bargain.
we
have
to
bargain
with
the
union
and
i
will
demonstrate
that
we
did.
i
do
believe
that
the
name
in
which
the
union
may
or
may
not
or
shall
or
shall
not
identify
itself
in
the
contract
is
a
term
or
condition
of
the
employment
and
is
therefore
bargainable
and
i
will
undertake
to
demonstrate
that
later,
if
that
answered
your
question.
now,
there's
one
other
question.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
you
suggested
to
mr.
manoli
and
inquired
as
to
what
he
would
think
if
in
the
course
of
the
bargaining
the
company
were
to
insist
that
the
union
refer
back
to
the
people.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
they
had
authority
and
what
they
should
do.
i
agree
with
mr.
manoli
that
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
company
to
do
that.
and
that
has
been
decided
i
think
--
i
think
that's
the
effect
of
the
corsicana
cotton
mills
case
below.
i
think
that's
far
different,
than
was
the
case
here
where
the
company
asked
the
union
not
to
refer
back
to
anybody.
the
company
fully
recognized
the
union's
representative
capacity
and
said
only
to
the
union,
“we
ask
that
you
agree
to
so
and
so.
we
don't
ask
that
you
to
go
back
to
anybody.
we
don't
ask
that
you
produce
any
further
authority.
we
ask
you
across
this
bargaining
table
to
agree
to
these
things
because
we
think
there
are
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
have
agreement
to
that.”
so
that
i
would
concede
that
if
we
asked
them
to
go
back
to
refurbish
their
authority
everyday,
that
would
be
clearly
an
unfair
labor
practice.
but
when
we
recognize
their
authority
without
question,
but
ask
them
to
exercise
that
authority
in
a
proper
way,
we
believe
that
we
were
bargaining
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
issues
under
the
contract?
mr.
james
c.
davis
you
mean
before
a
contract
is
to
be
entered
into,
your
honor
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
as
to
where
they
should
sign
as
to
given
issues
or
not?
mr.
james
c.
davis
oh,
i
think
we
have
right
after
the
contract
is
signed.
then
after
we
are
in
agreement
with
him
or
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
ask
them
to
agree,
to
a
provision
that
will
say,
“not
that
they
not
submit
to
people
issues
or
what
they
should
do
on
them
but
that
before
they
exercise
the
right
to
strike.”
that's
all
we
ask
them.
now,
mr.
manoli
stated
this
quite
accurately
in
his
oral
argument
here.
it's
stated
a
little
inaccurately
in
the
board's
brief.
but
as
he
correctly
said
to
the
court,
that
provision
simply
says,
“mr.
union,
we
ask
you
here
and
now
across
the
bargaining
table
to
agree,
not
that
you
will
submit
for
advisory
opinions
to
your
constituents,
what
you
will
do
or
will
not
do
about
any
given
issue,
or
what
position
you
will
take
in
grievances
or
what
position
you
were
to
take
on
anything
else.
solely,
do
we
ask
that
before
you
call
a
strike,
we
ask
that
you
agree
to
submit
the
question
to
a
vote.
you're
perfectly
free
to
call
a
strike
afterward.”
now,
we
--
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
that
kind
of
a
provision
advanced
in
good
faith,
is
not
a
valid
clause.
we
--
we're
getting
as
bad
as
governmental
agencies
in
their
identification
lingo
here.
we
call
that
a
limited
“no-strike”
clause.
and
i
think
those,
too,
indicate
the
--
the
thrust
of
our
--
of
our
reasoning.
mr.
james
c.
davis
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
that
statement
is
a
little
more
sweeping
than
--
than
my
position.
my
position
is,
that
with
respect
to
a
term
or
condition
of
employment,
and
that's
the
heart
of
this
because
nobody
has
ever
defined
that.
and
that
--
that's
why
this
case
arises.
that's
why
the
questions
that
have
been
posed
here
arise
and
i
--
i
want
to
get
to
that
before
i'm
through.
but
my
position
here
is
that
with
respect
to
a
term
or
condition
of
employment
and
i
think
this
is.
we
have
a
right
to
insist.
we
have
a
clear
statutory
right
not
to
agree.
we
have
a
clear
statutory
right
bringing
us
from
making
any
concession.
and
therefore,
we
have
a
right
in
my
opinion
to
say
to
the
union
as
a
condition
of
our
agreement,
to
what
you
want,
you
must
agree
to
what
we
want,
provided
they
are
in
the
appropriate
realm
of
bargaining.
now,
that
carries
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
distinction
earlier
between
permissible
and
compulsory
subjects
of
bargaining.
and
as
i
will
attempt
to
demonstrate,
there
lies
again
the
--
the
root
of
this
case,
because
i
think
there
are
few
if
any
bargainers.
and
with
all
due
respect,
to
the
board
and
the
lower
court,
few
if
any
boards
or
a
courts,
that
know
the
difference,
if
there
any,
between
permissible
and
compulsory
subjects
to
bargain
because
that
--
they
--
those
have
never
been
explored.
that
question
has
never
been
explored
from
the
ground
up.
it's
been
attempted
to
be
decided
from
the
top
down
each
time
and
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
and
usually
with
and
clear
overlay
of
bad
faith.
now,
i
want
to
make
perfectly
clear
to
this
court,
and
that
makes
a
substantial
difference
in
a
way
these
questions
are
approached,
that
there
is
no
question
of
the
bad
faith,
of
the
company
in
this
case.
there
were
some
suggestion
here
of
hardcore.
and
my
friend
omitted
to
state
that
at
all
stages
of
this
litigation,
the
general
counsel
before
the
board,
the
board
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
still,
there
is
an
complete
concession
that
the
company
in
this
case
was
at
all
times
in
good
faith.
mr.
james
c.
davis
then
the
machinery
wasn't
working,
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
i
knew
he
spoke
about
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
hardcore
but
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
the
heart
of
this
--
that's
the
heart
of
the
case
because,
we
have
for
decision
here
to
what
may
a
bargainer
in
good
faith
do
about
this
things.
now,
we
have
this
--
to
my
mind
as
--
as
a
practical
worker
in
this
field
the
anomalous
situation,
which
arises
from
this
concept
i
assume
of
permissible
and
compulsory
bargaining.
they
have
the
situation,
where
admittedly,
these
proposals
the
board
has
always
maintained
and
mr.
manoli
still
states
to
this
court,
both
of
these
proposals,
were
legal
to
make,
legal
to
include
in
the
contract,
legal
for
the
union
to
accept.
but
that
at
some
stage
in
the
game,
the
proposal
so
legal
to
make
and
legal
to
accept
became
illegal,
because
of
insistence.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
the
bargaining
stages,
when
insistence
replaces
the
strong
persuasion
or
vigorous
urging
i
don't
know.
it
is
argued
here
that
--
that
this
company
with
a
small
plant
in
western
ohio
in
its
first
contract
compelled
the
united
auto
workers
to
agree
to
something
that
they
didn't
want
to
agree
to.
that
is
an
interesting
concept
to
me,
too.
i
don't
know
when
compulsion
operates
against
that
union.
there
was
also
stated
here
that
the
local
agree
and
signed
the
contract.
that
is
true
but
that's
not
all
the
truth.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
this
union
and
this
company
have
had
a
long
history
of
bargaining
at
the
pesco
division
of
borg-warner,
another
division
making
the
same
product
in
cleveland
ohio,
in
a
heart
of
an
industrial
area.
the
same
bargainers
mr.
adams
who
represented
the
company
here,
mr.
(inaudible)
who
represented
the
union
here,
had
been
bargaining
with
each
other
for
years,
at
pesco
and
they
bargained
in
and
out
of
strikes.
the
record
here
is
that
when
this
division
was
opened,
the
uaw
came
down
avowedly
to
get
the
pesco
rates
of
pay.
now,
this
was
a
hard
bargaining.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
but
it
admittedly
was
in
good
faith.
now
at
pesco,
two
years
before,
i
think
it
was,
the
certification,
at
pesco
is
local
union
no.
269
of
the
international
auto
workers
and
so
forth.
they
bargained
right
up
to
a
strike
at
pesco
as
to
whether
the
union
would
be
identified
in
the
contract
by
the
local
name
as
the
company
attempted
to
insist,
or
and
as
it
was
certified,
or
as
the
union
insisted,
and
successfully
insisted
in
that
negotiation,
to
identify
the
union,
the
bargaining
representative.
now,
there's
only
one
bargaining
representative
in
all
of
these
cases.
and
the
bargaining
representative
at
pesco,
the
union
insisted
be
identified
as
the
international
but
the
local
is
the
only
one
certified.
the
international,
uaw
and
so
forth,
and
its
local
269,
and
they
bargained
that
right
up
to
a
strike.
and
the
company
had
to
decide
whether
to
take
the
strike
or
to
accept
a
recognition
identification,
call
it
what
you
will,
clause
which
did
not
identify
the
union
in
the
name
by
which
it
was
certified,
but
identified
it
in
a
different
name.
now,
the
same
bargainers,
moved
some
80
miles
from
cleveland
to
wooster
and
start
this
negotiation.
now,
as
mr.
manoli
said
this
was
--
it
was
a
consent
election,
your
honor
and
the
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
right
and
it
was
a
consent
election
and
nowhere
was
anybody
identified
as
the
international
(inaudible)
union.
the
names
on
the
ballot
were
uaw-cio,
uaw-afl.
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
right.
and
there
was
closed
election.
but
in
the
campaign
before
the
election,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
the
union
and
i
--
the
bargaining
representative
ultimately
selected
and
its
only
one
representative
no
matter
what
facet
of
its
organization
may
be
treated,
came
to
wooster
and
campaigned,
there
was
no
local
in
existence
at
wooster
at
the
time
of
the
representation
election
that
came
to
wooster
and
bargained
and
campaigned
on
the
ground
that
you
will
have
your
own
contact,
your
own
local
and
your
own
officers,
and
you'll
get
pasco
wages.
now,
in
that
background
with
the
same
bargainers,
the
same
protagonists
arose
the
issue
in
this
bargaining
as
to
how
the
union
would
be
identified.
the
board
says,
in
its
opinion
in
this
case,
that,
of
course,
we
were
free
to
reject
any
recognition
clause,
naming
the
union
by
anything
other
than
the
certification.
and
i
say
that
is
“life
in
a
never,
never
land”
so
far
as
bargaining
is
concerned.
we
weren't
any
freer
to
reject
it
here
than
we
were
to
reject
at
pesco.
the
first
proposal
that
was
served
upon
the
company
at
wooster
was
identified
as
proposal
of
local
1269,
i
think
it
was,
of
the
united
auto
workers.
it
was
handed
to
the
company
by
the
local
president.
it
wasn't
identified
as
proposal
of
the
international,
but
it
was
a
proposal
of
the
bargaining
representative,
and
it
was
identified
as
proposal
of
local
no.
1269
or
1369,
i've
forgotten
it.
in
the
body
of
the
proposal
it
was
suggested
that
the
bargaining
representative
be
identified
as
the
international
union
of
automobile
agricultural
implement
workers,
uaw-cio,
and
its
local
1369.
now,
of
course,
in
the
light
of
the
campaign
that
has
been
conducted,
it
was
a
fact
of
life
that
the
union
had
to
tag
the
local
into
the
name,
and
i
--
i
understand
that.
and
that's
all
right.
but
equally
in
the
light
to
the
campaign
in
good
faith
i
think
we
had
a
right
to
test
what
they
were
talking
about
and
say,
“well,
we
just
rather
have
you
identified
in
the
name
of
the
local.”
mr.
james
c.
davis
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
suggested
in
the
board's
brief
that
we
were
over
tender,
of
our
employees.
i
reject
the
suggestion.
we
were
looking
after
ourselves
and
as
i
have
argued
in
the
main
brief,
practical
experience
at
least,
in
our
part
of
the
world
shows
that
the
emphasis
which
is
placed
upon
the
agency
of
the
representative
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
the
administration
of
the
contract,
has
a
direct
effect,
sometimes
one
away
and
sometimes
another
on
industrial
fees,
the
ease
with
which
matters
go
forward.
the
ease
would
which
grievance
problems
are
washed
out.
mr.
james
c.
davis
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
the
union
was
just
as
interested
in
it
as
were
we,
and
we
have
found
that
when
the
major
emphasis,
is
away
in
many
unions,
we
get
much
more
difficulty
with
determining
problems
such
as
grievance
time,
promotion
increases,
job
bidding
that
sort
of
thing,
they
are
--
there
are
enumerated
at
page
--
well,
17.
now,
this
is
are
brief
in
court
of
appeals
but
there
were
some
30
issues,
in
issue,
at
the
time
the
strike
took
place,
and
among
them
were,
paid
grievance
time,
promotion
increases,
wash-up
time,
merit
increases.
union
representation
during
over
time
work
that
is
how
many
and
what
storage
or
the
like
should
present
on
an
overtime
shift,
not
normally
working
there,
job
bidding,
arbitration
and
the
like.
now,
we
found,
and
i
think
it's
the
experience
of
many
bargainers,
as
a
practical
matter
that
where
the
emphasis
--
where
the
emphasis
lies
locally
or
internationally
will
affect
the
resulting
agreement
and
the
administration
of
the
contract.
now,
there
are
some
instances
where
my
clients
would
prefer
to
have
the
emphasis
on
the
international
because
they
think
that
that
adds
greater
stability
to
the
contract
and
its
enforcement.
there
are
other
instances
where
in
good
faith
they
believe
that
the
emphasis
on
the
local
has
a
real
effect
on
working
conditions
in
the
plant.
mr.
james
c.
davis
that
is
not
been
our
experience
your
honor,
and
has
clearly
not
been
our
experience
in
this
particular
area
and
not
at
the
pesco
division
which
was
the
direct
ancestor
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
of
the
situation
here.
mr.
james
c.
davis
no,
there
we
have
international
administration.
we
had
local
certification,
but
insistence
by
the
union
upon
international
identification
and
we
have
had
very
heavy
international
administration
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
in
good
faith
sought
to
emphasize
local
administration
at
the
wooster
division,
not
for
any
solicitude
for
our
employees
but
for
the
--
our
best
judgment
as
to
what
would
best
produce
industrial
peace
in
that
plant.
mr.
james
c.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
because
--
yes
sir,
because
i
conceive
the
way
in
which
the
union
is
identified
in
the
contract
to
be
generally
recognized
subject
of
bargaining
and
thereby
to
have
become,
if
it
was
not
initially,
a
recognized
term
or
condition
of
employment
or
provision
which
with
reason
has
a
direct
effect,
there
are.
mr.
james
c.
davis
well,
your
honor,
that
to
my
mind
embarks
us
out
on
the
sea,
of
what
is
the
nature
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
is
it
a
contract?
is
it
a
contract
between
the
union
and
the
company
enforceable
by
each?
is
it
a
contract
for
the
benefit
of
third
persons,
is
at
the
set
of
ground
rules
by
which
the
contract
of
higher
between
the
company
and
the
individual
man
may
be
judged?
this
court's
wrapped
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
or
is
it
sui
generis.
mr.
james
c.
davis
now,
this
court
has
grappled
with
that
question
and
i
am
not
crystal
clear
as
to
the
result
and
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
dispositive
of
this
issue.
so,
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
i
did
not
propose
to
deal
with
the
common
law
effect
or
the
right
of
either
the
union,
the
representative,
or
the
company,
or
in
what
name,
or
how
to
enforce
the
contract
in
lieu
of
breach
thereof.
mr.
james
c.
davis
your
honor
i
agree
the
question
has
to
be
faced
but
i
am
reasonably
certain,
it
does
not
have
to
be
faced
in
this
case
and
may
i
therefore
beg
to
be
excused.
mr.
james
c.
davis
now
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
in
tone,
in
atmosphere,
the
local
succumbed
as
mr.
manoli
suggested
not
on
its
own
initiative
but
at
the
direct
order
of
the
international
representatives.
the
contract
which
they
signed,
and
by
the
way,
this
evidence
is
without
dispute,
that
it
was
always
the
idea
of
the
company
that
the
international
would
monitor
the
contract
and
would
sign
it,
approving
it.
that
it
would
never
be
signed
without
the
approval
of
the
international.
the
contract
which
was
ultimately
signed
was
taken
to
detroit,
and
approved
by
the
general
executive
committee
of
the
uaw
at
detroit
before
the
local
was
directed
to
sign
it.
and
the
local
were
directed
to
go
in
and
sign
the
contract
by
the
responsible
international
officer
so
that
there
was
--
there's
no
fragmentation
of
this
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
in
the
administration
of
it
afterward
it
was
administered
by
both
local
and
international
officers.
mr.
james
c.
davis
yes
sir.
in
emphasis
there
were
more
things
settled
at
the
plant
level
through
the
local
officers
and
without
making
a
big
deal
about
it
with
--
with
international
officers.
in
fact,
the
bargaining
unit
--
now,
this
was
with
international,
the
bargaining
unit
was
expanded.
there
was
a
--
an
--
another
small
division
moved
into
the
plant.
and
negotiations
were
had
with
both
local
and
international
representatives
expanding
the
unit
including
these
men
in
and
industrial
peace
followed
with
no
--
with
no
question,
but
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
no
sir
the
--
the
agreement
has
terminated
and
has
not
been
renewed
largely
as
result
of
this
litigation
and
other
facts.
mr.
james
c.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
if
--
if
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
first
place,
may
i
very
respectfully
suggest
that
we
do
not
think
we
have
overwritten
that,
nor
do
i
think
that
we
have
departed
from
the
certificate,
which
is
--
and
i
--
i
did
not
mean
to
avoid
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
except
as
he
was
--
i
thought
asking
is
to
what
the
common
law
of
contractual
relations,
were.
now,
i
think
the
international's
got
a
right
to
enforce
this
contract.
the
union's
got
a
right
to
enter
--
to
enforce
the
kind
of
--
the
bargaining
representative,
and
it
is
the
international
as
a
whole.
now,
the
--
the
statute
says,
that
the
representative
elected
by
the
people
shall
be
the
exclusive
representative.
the
representative
elected
by
the
people
as
this
record
shows
was
not
this
long
name
international
so
on,
so
on.
all
they
had
on
the
ballot
was
uaw-cio,
that's
all.
mr.
james
c.
davis
then
board
certifies
the
international
union
in
its
full
name
but
which
never
was
presented
to
the
people.
mr.
james
c.
davis
there
was
no
local
at
that
time
your
honor
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
correct
there
was
no
local
at
the
time.
mr.
james
c.
davis
in
said
election.
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
right,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
james
c.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
james
c.
davis
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
james
c.
davis
there's
no
--
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
james
c.
davis
all
right,
the
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
the
--
the
--
in
--
in
my
--
in
my
judgment,
your
honor,
the
--
there
is
no
representative
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
under
the
constitution
of
the
union
independent
and
apart
from
the
local.
no
man
can
be
a
member
of
this
union
without
being
a
member
of
the
local.
the
constitution
so
provides.
the
constitution
provides
that
the
international
officers
as
such
have
no
authority
even
to
negotiate
a
contract
without
the
approval
of
the
local.
now,
i
agree,
that
those
are
all
matters
of
internal
administration,
internal
law
of
the
union
which
the
union
would
from
time
to
time
have
a
right
to
change
wholly
independent
of
the
company
and
the
company
has
no
right
to
dictate
that.
but
i
say
that
it
is
a
long
established
practice
in
industry,
in
this
country
to
bargain
with
unions,
as
to
the
name
in
which
they
shall
be
identified
in
a
contract
and
that
the
certificate
has
never
been
thought
to
be
a
bar
to
that
and
has
never
been
thought
to
be
derogated
by
that
by
either
unions
or
companies.
we
are
not
seeking
here
to
contract
with
a
separate
organization.
and
it
is
a
question
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
of
what
is
or
is
not
a
term
or
condition
of
employment
and
therefore,
a
matter
of
bargaining
area
and
not
a
question
of
recognition.
the
statute
never
uses
the
word
"recognition",
never
uses
the
word
"representative
status".
those
are
gloss
and
grafted
on
the
statute
by
courts
who
have
moved
into
this
thing
without
--
without
segregating
recognition,
bargaining
area
and
good
faith.
they're
--
they're
all
blended
together.
now,
it's
my
position
that
the
statutory
requirement
of
recognition
is
very
simple.
it
is
meet,
that's
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
--
it's
defined
in
8
(d),
the
--
the
obligation
of
bargaining
collectively
is
defined
as
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
representative
of
the
employees
and
then
if
you
engraft
on
to
that,
the
provision
that
you
must
do
so
as
the
exclusive
representatives
--
representative
to
the
employees
to
discuss
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
there
is
no
dispute
but
what
we
met
and
conferred
with
local
representatives,
international
representatives.
they've
got
what
they
call
a
borg-warner
counsel,
with
borg-warner
counsel
representatives.
we
met
and
conferred
with
every
union
officer
of
what
every
category
that
ever
presented
himself
in
our
door.
mr.
james
c.
davis
well
that
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
that
is
the
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
--
that
is
a
legal
characterization
which
--
which
i
do
not
accept
because
we
have
never
failed,
in
recognition,
to
a
meet
and
confer
in
good
faith
with
international
and
every
other
representative
of
the
union.
we
did
bargain
with
them
and
insist,
if
the
word
be
used,
as
to
how
they
should
be
termed
--
recognized
in
the
contract,
identified.
they
did
not
have
to
accept.
and
the
--
the
theory
of
the
act
is
that
if
that
be
a
bargainable
issue
there
is
no
duty
to
accept.
there's
no
duty
agree.
if
we
both
approach
it
in
good
faith,
and
cannot
agree,
we
are
left
to
our
economic
resources.
but
i
say
that
recognition
under
labor
law,
under
this
statute,
goes
no
further
than
the
statutory
requirement
that
we
meet
and
confer
in
good
faith
with
the
union
as
the
exclusive
representative
and
don't
go
behind
it,
and
we
never
failed
to
do
that
at
any
time.
mr.
james
c.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
that's
my
position,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
--
i
want
--
mr.
james
c.
davis
the
substance
to
the
position
is,
and
i
think
we
could
--
that,
i
think,
is
a
fair
question.
the
substance
to
the
position
is,
and
we
could
have
put
it
into
the
contract
in
many,
many
words,
we
signed
the
contract
with
the
international
and
we
recognize
you
as
the
exclusive
agent
in
your
words
but
we
want
it
understood
that
the
principal
responsibility
for
handling
grievances,
for
handling
stewards'
time,
for
the
size
of
the
grievance
committee
and
all
of
these
many
things,
the
primary
responsibility
will
be
by
you
on
your
behalf
handled
by
your
local
union.
