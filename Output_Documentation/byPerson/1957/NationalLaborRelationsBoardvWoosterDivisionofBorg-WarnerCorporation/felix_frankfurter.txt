justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
isn't
relevant,
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
if
these
were
problems
--
but
you
said
to
exclude.
does
that
mean
would
the
local
be
also
a
party
to
the
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
mean
--
if
--
would
it
all
--
with
the
--
with
the
local
--
tell
me,
in
the
first
place,
what
is
--
if
there
be
common
factors,
a
local
joined
the
collective
agreements
where
the
international
is
certified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
was
the
old
--
that
was
the
little
knowledge
(inaudible)
around
my
head.
i
thought
that
used
to
be
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
are
the
industrial
considerations
for
inclusion
not
exclusion
to
the
international
but
inclusion
to
the
local?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
matter
that
here
for
us,
but
this
does
involve
the
whole
problem
of
delegation
and
autonomy
of
locals
and
responsibility
of
federal
isn't
it?
i
mean,
in
the
union
as
between
local
and
international,
problems
are
not
solved,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what's
goes
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you've
indicated
an
international
i
shan't
name
but
you
and
i
could
name
several,
exercises
responsibility
over
the
local
about
contract.
there's
another
problem
of
the
local
not
being
dragged
into
strikes
exactly.
or,
i
withdraw
the
word
drag
and
having
an
interest
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
strike.
i'm
not
now
considering
the
question
of
whether
the
discourse
and
namely,
where
the
international
is
dissatisfied
and
what
the
implications
of
such
certifications
are
derivable
from
the
act.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
why
the
issues
of
--
of
labor
union
responsibility
and
strategy
and
the
rest.
i
think
that's
in
the
related
problems
as
to
the
local
and
international.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on,
i
want
to
be
clear.
your
contention
is
at
section
15
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
it
because
the
insistence
proved
want
of
good
faith
or
because
the
proposal
itself
undermined
or
is
--
is
antagonistic
to
the
act.
it
isn't
--
you
don't
go
on
ground
that
it
--
it
shows
the
ones
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
waive
this
right
--
meaning
something
that
it
gets
from
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
my
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
part
is
that
vague
of
a
question,
doesn't
it?
whether
complete
control
includes
disallowance
of
an
--
of
an
employer
to
insist
on
such
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
he
has
complete
control
and
this
is
negative.this
had
to
answer
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
we're
here
for
to
see
what
the
answer
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
the
--
the
analogy
you
gave
if
i
may
say
so
is
a
little
different.
plainly
enough,
the
salaries
of
officers
of
the
corporation
are
not
in
matters
and
just
are
arranged
but
the
scope
of
the
activity
of
a
union
and
--
and
purposely
we
lack
lose
language
is
--
is
not
so
confined
to
define
it.
you
can
say
that
isn't
something
that
isn't
but
the
effective
--
but
the
effective
furtherance
of
the
act.
i'm
not
passing
judgment
on
this
specific
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
subject
matter
is
related
to
the
maintenance
of
these
an
industrial
and
industrial
good
relation.
i'm
not
saying
its
wise
or
unwise
but
when
you
say
you
go
along
way
when
you
say
that
this
is
something
that's
all
right
if
they
want
to
do
that
because
what
you're
dealing
here
with
is
a
subject
matter
that
relates
to
the
exercise
of
responsibility
by
a
person
who
has
responsibility
and
that
not's
foreign
to
to
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
--
don't
let
me
dislodge
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
i'm
sure
yours
is
better
than
my
question
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
on
the
5%
the
union
in
their
own
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
you
the
provision
for
a
cooling
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
--
in
the
contract,
the
insistence
by
(inaudible)
some
provision
that
before
the
executive
of
the
union
calls
a
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
effect
some
cooling
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
not
uncommon,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
going
beyond
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
the
provision
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
should
be
the
argument
because
i'm
just
trying
this
to
be
a
fascinating
and
difficult
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
know
as
i'm
looking
at
your
brief.
this
problem
reminds
me
of
a
good
deal
of
controversy
--
judicial
decisions
of
the
five-year
opinions
of
(inaudible)
whether
the
referendum
if
into
provisions
of
state
constitution.
the
legislative
power
shall
be
vested
in
legislation.
and
that
has
been
the
subject
of
a
diversity
of
opinion
on
the
courts
whether
--
since
the
legislative
power
vested
the
legislature.
can
you
get
the
advisory
referenda
and
so
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
raises
comparable
problems
of
--
of
the
exercise
of
power,
the
responsibility
for
which
lies
in
the
designated
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
referred
advisory,
would
it
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short
there
are
limitations
of
the
democratic
process
in
the
conduct
of
the
union.
i
don't
mean
to
be
frivolous
about
it
but
that's
--
that's
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
implication
to
draw
from
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
it
wasn't
for
the
specific
--
as
a
--
as
is
intended
to
be
a
requirement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
look
at
--
i
have
a
little
bit
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
to
the
court
an
insistence
on
a
clause
that
the
bargaining
representative
should
be
--
should
refer
back
to
the
union
membership
whether
there
should
be
a
bargaining
clause
right
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
i
didn't
mean
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
should
be
operative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
--
this
is
an
insistence
on
a
--
on
a
clause
that
would
come
into
operation.
but
i'm
suggesting
a
proposal
to
violate
a
bargain
to
refer
back
to
the
--
to
the
membership
to
that
--
to
the
principles
of
the
--
of
the
agency
whether
they
should
waive
their
right
to
decide
for
themselves
and
not
to
go
back
to
make
a
decision
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
this
would
prevail
for
instance
the
international
couldn't
sue
--
couldn't
utilize
301?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
at
the
outset
whether
you
agree
to
the
--
the
answer
that
mr.
manoli
just
gave?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not?
i
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mean
the
very
--
the
very
specific
question
that
i
asked
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
to
get
you
off
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
your
position
is
that
you
have
a
right
to
insist
that
they
agree
to
something
which
of
their
own
volition,
they
may
agree
to.
you
insist
that
they
should
agree.
you
insist
to
your
right
to
hold
out,
for
them
to
agree
to
put
in
a
clause
which
they
may
choose
to
put
in
if
they
may
so
choose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli
stated
in
so
many
words
there's
no
suggestion
of
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
you
have
the
right
insist
of
your
--
what
you
would
like
to
call
yourself
to
ensure
your
intimate
point
of
view,
you
have
a
right
to
insist
where
the
emphasis
should
lie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
who
by
appropriate
machinery
has
been
made
designated
as
a
matter
of
law
that
designated
agent
and
therefore
to
enforce
at
law,
or
whatever
rights
may
approve
of
such
a
decree?
that
i
take
it
is
a
burden
to
mr.
manoli
to
argue
that
as
machinery
for
determining
who
represents
the
man,
that
person
who
represents
the
man
is
in
fact
to
represent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
can
assure
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
you're
a
wise
man
to
abstain
from
that,
not
to
get
into
that
quagmire
but
i
still
insist
that
the
question
has
to
be
the
faced,
what
it
means
under
the
act
for
somebody
to
be
made
the
organ
of
speech
and
the
promoter
of
certain
interests
of
labor
people
called
the
bargaining
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
there
wasn't
a
local
at
the
time
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
they
couldn't
have
named
the
local.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they're
going
from
there,
through
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
go
on
from
there
the
--
the
concession
--
that
doesn't
mean
--
the
answers
you
made,
yes,
yes
to
all
these
in
going
from
there
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
you
would
have
been
prepared
to
accept
a
clause,
agree
with
them,
which
said
in
effect
and
--
and
try
to
say
this
(inaudible)
that
in
every
possible
way,
the
international
is
the
bargaining
agency
but
you
simply
don't
want
their
name
in
the
contract,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there
must
be
some
substance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
ascertain
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
ask
you
what
i
--
i
hope
mr.
manoli
would
have
time
to
answer
it,
too.
when
one
says
practice,
this
is
--
that
practice
is
to
bargain
about
this
even
for
myself,
if
that
were
established
that
it
is
a
practice
to
bargain
about
what
you
call
identification
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
very
important
for
me.
by
practice,
i
mean,
do
you
mean
anything
different
by
the
taxes,
has
conveyed
the
idea
of
a
substantial
uniformity
of
instances
dealing
with
the
particular
subject.
now,
the
things
you
referred
in
your
brief,
it
don't
seem
to
me
to
clarify
that
concept
of
practice
because
some
employers
refer
one,
some
employers
refer
another.
some
unions
prefer
one.
some
unions
prefer
other.
that's
a
very
--
what
you
quote
there,
i
haven't
read
the
--
but
you
don't
uphold,
i've
read
what
you've
said,
that's
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
clearly
means
that
there
are
certain
preferences
of
individual
instances
and
individual
context.
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
marshalling
evidence
there.
when
they
sit
down
at
the
bargaining
table,
in
fact,
what
was
sought
here
is
a
--
a
quantitatively
recurring
insistence
at
the
bargaining
table
establishing
itself
within
the
--
within
the
acceptance
of
industry
as
a
kind
of
thing
about
which
they
can
be
bargained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
would
be
very
sticky
about
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
it
produces
a
lot
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
can't
go
--
there
is
no
formal
appeal.
there
is
no
code
of
labor
law
which
tells
us
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
fairly
includable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
term
of
employment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
people
who
day
by
day
or
week
by
--
or
year
by
year
sit
down
and
heckle
about
a
thing
as
affecting
their
industry.
that
for
me
is
a
part
for
demonstration
that
that's
related
to
the
industry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't,
as
i
understand
it,
to
say,
you
are
prepared
to
have
the
international
via
signatory
powers
to
this
agreement,
but
in
everybody's
interest
and
incidentally
it
is,
but
you
didn't
take
the
position
that
while
you
are
ready
to
have
the
international
to
formally
certified
agents
sign
the
agreement
in
the
interest
of
--
of
fixing
or
enhancing
responsibility
in
the
part
of
the
people
who
really
have
to
work
with
the
agreement,
you
also
want
the
local
names
attached
to
the
agreement
because
that
will
further
the
purpose
of
the
agreement.
that
was
not
your
insistence
at
the
bargaining
table,
wasn't
it?
your
insistence
was
that
the
international
be
excluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
want
them
to
be
a
signatory
to
the
contract,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
repeat
my
question.
your
position
was
not
--
it's
all
right
with
us
if
that's
your
scheme
of
things
to
have
the
international
sign
it.
go
and
sign
it
also,
sign
it,
but
we
also
want
the
signature
of
the
local
because
that
will
have
potency
in
fixing
the
responsibility
upon
the
people
in
wooster.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
do
that,
basically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did
not
as
--
that
it
be
a
(inaudible)
as
i
can
be.
the
contract
is
an
arrangement
between
people.
you
did
not
want
the
international
to
be
one
of
the
persons
who
will
--
was
on
one
side,
one
of
the
parties
of
such
an
arrangement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
either
or
either
words
or
not
the
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
are
words,
then
i
don't
see
what
your
insistence
amongst
it.
if
they're
not
the
words,
then
we've
got
to
go
to
the
significant
division.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
so
then
they
--
the
basis
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
is
the
international.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you?
are
you
finished?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
and
this
is
a
hypothetical
case,
if
you
could
shed
some
light,
to
go
--
the
insistence
was
in
the
form
in
which
i
have
put
it
to
mr.
davis
(inaudible)
argument
namely
that
the
--
the
company,
there's
an
atmosphere
cycle
--
psychological
consideration,
prestige,
etcetera,
etcetera.
those
pressures
are
really
a
desirable
thing
in
maintaining
this
relation
and
so
on.
and
to
that
end,
it
helps
in
our
opinion
that
the
local
also
put
its
name
down
on
this
piece
of
paper.
would
that
be
within
the
bargaining?
would
that
be
allowable?
would
you
be
here
if
that
was
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
if
they
--
if
they
had
opposed
and
the
employer
insisted,
would
you
be
here?and
said,
all
right
we
--
this
is
our
sticking
point.
would
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
