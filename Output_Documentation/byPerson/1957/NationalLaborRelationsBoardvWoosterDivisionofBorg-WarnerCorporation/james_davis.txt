mr.
james
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
one
thing
that
i
would
like
to
correct
in
my
argument
of
yesterday,
i
--
my
memory
played
me
false
and
i
made
a
--
an
inaccurate
statement
of
facts
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
currently
a
contract
between
the
parties,
there
is.
at
the
expiration
of
the
contract
negotiated
which
gave
rise
to
this
controversy
and
another
three-year
contract
was
entered
into.
it
is
still
in
effect,
still
being
administered
and
has
not
quite
two
years
yet
to
run.
mr.
james
davis
no,
sir.
the
signatory
there
was
the
international.
that
contract
was
entered
into
during
the
period
when
certiorari
was
pending
and
there
was
outstanding
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
enforcing
the
contract
so
that
the
company
made
no
question
about
that
and
the
contract
was
--
that
contract
was
signed
by
the
name
of
the
international.
now,
i'm
not
entirely
satisfied
that
i
fully
answered
the
questions
which
the
chief
justice
directed
to
me
last
evening.
because
of
the
shortage
of
time,
i
was
trying
to
truncate
the
answer
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
question
can
be
answered
as
summarily
as
i
attempted
to
do
because
the
question
in
its
full
implication
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
whole
case
and
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
it
can
be
answered
summarily
without
a
little
further
explanation.
and
i
would
like
with
the
permission
of
the
court
to
address
myself
to
that
question
now,
which
as
i
recall
was
in
essence.
“mr.
davis,
aren't
you
departing
from
the
certification
of
the
board
and
if
you
are,
by
what
right
do
you
claim
to
act
in
--
in
essence?”
i
think
that
was
what
you
asked
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
davis
and
of
course,
that
goes
to
one
of
the
fundamental
issues
in
the
case
and
i
think
requires
a
little
further
analysis
than
i
was
able
to
make
last
night.
now,
in
the
first
place
as
i
view
the
statute,
there
is
no
magic
in
certification
other
than
to
identify
the
representative
through
whom
bargaining
is
to
be
carried
on.
the
board
itself
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
has
held
that
the
function
of
the
certification
is
only
to
name,
i.e.
identify
the
bargaining
representative
and
has
no
purpose
to
either
delimit
or
delineate
the
bargaining
agents'
functions.
therefore,
once
the
certification
has
been
made
as
i
view
it,
the
parties
are
in
no
different
posture.
then,
it
would
be
the
case
where
the
bargaining
agent
to
present
itself
to
the
employer
and
be
recognized
voluntarily.
the
--
the
certification
does
nothing
but
identify
the
bargaining
agent.
now
then,
to
go
further
and
this
is
where
it
gets
to
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
heart
of
the
case
and
what
i
meant
yesterday
in
part
when
i
said
to
date,
i
think
both
board
and
lower
courts
have
attempted
to
reach
this
case
from
the
top
or
these
--
these
cases
from
the
top
down
and
instead
of
starting
at
the
bottom
and
laying
the
statute
there
and
--
and
working
the
thing
up.
now,
there
is
--
it
seems
to
me
a
clear
distinction
between
the
statutory
requirements
for
bargaining
and
contracting
or
be
it
that
i
fully
recognize
that
the
execution
of
a
contract,
evidence
in
an
agreement
reached
is
mandatory
under
the
statute,
under
the
act.
but
we're
charged
here
with
a
failure
to
bargain
in
violation
of
885.
now,
bargaining
as
prescribed
in
the
act
says
nothing
about
recognition
or
status
or
any
other
words
of
that
import.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
bargaining
agent
having
been
identified
by
certification
or
otherwise
that
then
we
are
compelled
to
meet
and
confer,
that
is
every
employer
is
compelled,
to
meet
and
confer
in
good
faith
with
that
bargaining
agent.
to
the
end,
that
agreement
may
be
reached,
but
there
is
no
compulsion
to
contract
until
agreement
is
reached
and
then
only
as
evidenced
of
such
agreement
as
is
reached.
there
is
no
statutory
mandate
that
the
contract
shall
be
in
the
name
of
the
bargaining
agent
or
in
the
name
of
any
branch
or
part
of
the
bargaining
agent.
the
statute
simply
says
that
we
shall
meet
and
confer
with
the
bargaining
agent
and
with
no
other,
which
we
did
admittedly.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
now,
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
i
think
without
dispute
and
certainly
evidenced
in
our
brief
that
the
question
of
how
the
bargaining
agent
is
to
be
identified
in
a
contract
is
a
usual
and
frequent
subject
of
bargaining.
now,
if
--
if
identifying
the
bargaining
agent
in
a
name
other
than
the
certificate
or
in
a
name
other
than
the
card
which
is
presented
to
the
receptionist
when
the
union
comes
in
for
voluntary
recognition,
derogates
the
union
status.
the
union
is
no
more
free
so
to
derogate
its
status
than
are
we,
because
the
statute
imposes
a
reciprocal
obligation
as
i
read
it.
we
are
compelled
to
recognize
exclusively
the
representative
status,
so
to
speak.
we
are
to
bargain
with
no
other.
but
the
union
is
equally
under
a
mandate
to
bargain
with
us,
as
the
exclusive
representative.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
no
more
entitled,
that
the
union
is
no
more
entitled.
it
has
--
it
has
gone
to
the
electorate.
it
has
sought
a
charter
of
representation.
and
if
there
is
magic
in
the
particular
name,
the
union
owes
the
same
obligation
to
the
people,
not
to
derogate
from
the
representation
authority
which
had
--
with
which
it
has
been
impressed
with
as
we
all
not
to
attempt
to
dilute
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
this
question
of
the
name
in
which
a
union
is
to
be
identified
is
not
a
question
of
recognition
at
all.
mr.
james
davis
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
union
is
--
it's
a
whole
and
the
parts.
now,
they
are
two
separate
--
mr.
james
davis
they
are
two
separate
labor
organization.
mr.
james
davis
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
not
if
it
is
a
term
or
condition
of
employment.
now,
my
--
my
point
is
right
or
wrong
and
i
--
i
want
to
try
to
make
my
point
clear
anyway
and
then
--
then
go
on.
my
point
is
that
so
far
as
recognition
is
concern,
the
word
is
not
used
in
the
statute.
the
mandate
of
the
statute
is
to
meet
and
confer
to
the
exclusion
of
any
other
and
that
we
did
and
in
good
faith.
we
are
--
the
three
mandates
in
the
statute,
to
meet
and
confer
forum,
to
meet
and
confer
to
the
--
with
the
union
to
the
exclusion
of
others
and
in
good
faith
and
about
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
we
did
meet
and
confer.
we
met
and
conferred
with
every
representative
of
the
--
the
union
presented
to
us.
we
never
turned
anybody
away.
we
met
and
conferred
in
good
faith
and
i
think
in
essence
that
this
case
really
is
only
--
involves
whether
or
not
these
two
proposals
were
or
were
not
terms
or
conditions
of
employment.
now,
if
--
if
they
are
two
entities,
as
your
honor
suggests,
then
not
only
this
employer
and
this
union
have
misconceived
the
statute,
but
still
have
many,
many
other
employers
and
many,
many
other
unions.
mr.
james
davis
there
is
--
mr.
james
davis
there
is
a
--
mr.
james
davis
well,
that
jumps,
the
first
fence,
you
see
your
honor,
if
i
may
say
so.
the
short
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
james
davis
there
is
such
a
practice.
mr.
james
davis
i
have
tried
to
evidence
it
in
the
brief
by
a
reference
to
bna,
cch,
other
recognized
bargaining
tools
to
show
that
the
subject
of
how
a
union
is
to
be
identified
is
a
common
subject
of
bargaining
and
is
recognized
by
both
employers
and
unions
as
a
proper
subject
to
bargaining.
now,
in
the
--
not
only
is
that
a
general
industrial
practice,
but
as
i
attempted
to
call
to
the
court's
yesterday,
it
is
a
fixed
practice
with
this
union
and
even
more
sharply
between
this
union
and
this
employer.
because
in
the
wooster
division,
the
union
there
bargained
right
up
to
a
strike
for
expansion
of
the
representative
from
the
certified
local
to
a
recognition
of
the
local
and
the
international.
now,
if
the
certificate
means
that
the
person
named
therein
must
be
dealt
with
and
contracted
with
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
then
to
add
a
joint
sort
of
a
party
to
the
contract
is
just
as
much
a
derogation
of
the
exclusivity
as
is
a
contraction
of
it
and
even
if
we
were
to
return
to
the
question
of
the
common
law
right
of
the
designated
bargaining
agent
exclusively
to
enforce
the
contract,
if
we
add
another
necessary
party
plaintiff,
we
are
derogating
from
that
exclusivity.
now,
so
far
as
administration
of
the
contract
is
concerned,
and
these
are
all
the
same
type
subjects,
your
honor.
it
is
a
common
bargaining
practice
to
bargain
about
the
size
of
a
grievance
committee
with
--
with
the
designated
agent
whether
he
be
certified
or
voluntarily
recognized,
the
size
of
a
bargaining
committee,
the
personnel
of
a
bargaining
committee,
the
size
of
a
grievance
committee,
the
personnel
of
a
grievance
committee.
will
it
be
--
include
local
or
international
officers?
the
--
in
the
grievance
procedure
that
steps
at
which
the
union,
the
bargaining
agent
will
be
represented
solely
by
local
representatives
or
solely
by
international
representatives
or
by
both.
these
questions,
once
recognition
and
i
conceive
recognition
to
be
to
meet
and
confer
with
none
other
in
good
faith
and
i
find
nothing
in
the
statute
to
mean
otherwise.
once
that
is
crossed
then
these
questions
and
these
--
these
things
work
both
ways.
i
mean,
this
isn't
a
one
way
street
for
employers
as
--
as
the
court
well
knows.
i
mean,
there
is
this
--
this
flexibility
of
the
--
of
subjects
of
bargaining.
the
bargaining
area
isn't
--
isn't
a
fixed
area.
we
will
know
the
chagrin
which
many
employers
felt
when
the
inland
steel
case
was
first
decided
and
they
found
out
that
pensions
were
bargainable.
now,
in
retrospect
when
--
when
one
wonders
how
anybody
perhaps
might
have
so
conceived,
but
the
--
these
questions
of
bargaining,
the
questions
of
how
the
union
shall
operate
or
how
the
company
shall
operate
in
this
type
of
area
are
--
are
clearly
recognized
as
bargainable
in
practice,
in
--
mr.
james
davis
--
practical
application.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
davis
well
--
mr.
james
davis
well,
i
may
try
to
take
that
apart
for
a
minute
and
add
--
and
i
will
try
to
answer
it,
your
honor,
because
it
--
it
--
my
time
is
running
out,
but
it's
--
it's
important.
there
is
not
as
far
as
this
union
and
this
company
is
concerned,
this
was
their
first
contract.
there
is
not
a
practice
in
the
sense
of
a
common
law
accustomed
to
be
pleaded
and
proved.
mr.
james
davis
in
--
in
--
mr.
james
davis
in
some
instances
--
now
in
some
instances,
the
steelworkers
for
instance
have
a
universal
practice
of
insisting
that
the
contract
be
with
the
international
union.
they
do
not
let
their
locals
sign
a
contract
as
a
uniform
practice.
the
teamsters
and
hoisting
engineers
for
instance,
in
the
hoisting
engineers,
you
deal
--
you
bargain
with
them
and
you
have
a
contract
signed
with
the
local
and
central
wooster
has
got
a
stamp
on
it
to
prove
this
to
form
only
and
that's
the
only
thing
that
international
has
to
do
with
it.
i
think
the
teamsters
insist
on
contracts
being
their
local
range.
i
think
that
they
do
that
to
avoid
as
they
think
legal
liability.
now,
whether
they
are
right
in
their
--
in
their
legal
concept,
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
care
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor
is
not
that
there
is
a
practice
of
either
union
even
though
there
is
in
some
instances,
but
not
as
applied
here
that
there
is
a
practice
either
of
unions
uniformly
to
insist
on
one
thing
or
a
company
uniformly
to
insist
on
the
other.
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
the
court
is
that
there
is
a
general
recognition
on
both
sides
of
the
bargaining
table
that
the
way
in
which
a
union
is
identified
in
the
contract
has
a
--
such
a
relation
to
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
as
to
be
likely
to
have
and
affect
thereon
and
therefore
in
my
opinion.
it
becomes
a
term
or
condition
of
employment
subject
to
bargaining.
now,
there
is
implicit
in
what
you
say,
the
other
question,
as
to
if
we're
going
to
determine
whether
things
are
bargainable
or
non-bargainable
by
practice,
when
this
practice
begin
and
when
this
isolated
instance
ceased
to
be
such
and
become
practice.
and
therefore,
when
does
a
given
subject
of
bargaining
become
legal
after
having
been
illegal
because
it
was
not
a
recognized
practice.
that
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case,
too.
now,
let
me
go
quickly
to
this
--
mr.
james
davis
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
davis
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
davis
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
davis
that
is
my
point,
your
honor,
sir.
now,
we
go
next
to
the
--
to
the
strike
clause
which
is
in
the
same
category.
mr.
james
davis
suppose
if
the
certification,
your
honor,
is
of
local
1260,
united
steelworkers
--
mr.
james
davis
well,
all
right,
but
if
i
may
say
with
all
respect
you
want
everything
your
way
[laughs]
and
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
james
davis
that
--
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
right.
that's
all
right,
sir.
but
it
arises
both
ways.
i
would
say
yes,
that
no
matter
what
may
be
the
internal
arrangement
of
a
union,
no
matter
what
it
may
be,
if
this
is
a
subject
which
is
in
fact
a
term
or
condition
of
employment
or
so
closely
affects
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
as
to
be
practically
apart
there
of
it
to
lift
the
old
test
of
this
court
in
fela
cases
in
the
--
from
the
old
peterson
case.
then,
i
say
that
it
is
bargainable
without
regard
to
the
internal
organization
of
the
union
provided
both
parties
are
in
good
faith
and
that
if
the
unions
internal
arrangement
precludes
it
from
bargaining
about
what
are
in
fact
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
it
must
get
its
internal
arrangements
in
order.
now,
the
--
the
strike
clause
--
my
time
is
about
expired.
the
strike
clause
was
lifted
in
this
case
from
a
uaw
contract.
the
uaw
bargained
this
clause
up
with
the
allis-chalmers
chalmers
company
and
included
it
in
contract.
they
have
it
in
several.
for
our
purposes,
we
think
that
the
fact
that
they
bargained
about,
that
they
have
accepted
it
in
their
contract
indicates
that
they
think
that
it
affects
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
or
is
so
closely
connected
therewith
as
to
affect
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.it
has
been
a
subject
of
bargaining.
now,
by
this
--
it
was
all
in
my
brief,
my
basic
objection
to
the
board
position
herein
that
they
have
applied
a
mechanical
per
se
artificial
test
to
determine
the
activity
of
the
parties
and
to
limit
the
bargaining
area
and
that
the
statute
does
no
such
thing
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
statute
is
to
leave
the
parties
free,
to
explore,
to
expand,
if
possible
their
areas
of
agreement.
and
so
long
as
they
are
in
good
faith
and
the
subjects
with
which
they
are
discussing
are
either
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
or
relate
thereto
or
are
so
closely
connected
as
to
be
reasonably
deemed
to
affect
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
the
very
fact
that
they
talk
about
them
is
certainly
strong
evidence
that
they
do
or
that
they
strike
about
them.
that
then,
i
think
they
are
bargainable
and
i
think
that
recognition
and
it
should
be
--
i
--
i
think
this
court
has
an
opportunity
here
to
clarify
this
issue
to
get
the
gloss
off
of
this,
to
get
down
to
fundamentals
that
recognition
provided
we
are
in
good
faith
consists
of
meeting
and
conferring
exclusively
with
the
agent
and
with
none
other.
and
that
once
that
is
clarified,
that
we
are
then
down
to
the
freedom
of
both
sides
to
explore
these
questions
if
they
do
have
a
--
are
likely
to
have
an
affect
or
likely
to
affect
terms
and
conditions
of
the
party.
mr.
james
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
davis
no,
sir.
my
insistence
at
the
bargaining
table
was
that
the
local
sign
the
contract
or
that
the
contract
be
signed
in
the
name
of
the
local,
that
the
--
i
conceive
of
the
union
as
an
entity.
and
there
--
the
--
although
the
international
and
the
local
maybe
separate
labor
organizations
under
the
statute,
they
are
not
separate
entities,
it's
a
single
entity.
i
--
we
insisted
that
the
local
sign
the
contract
as
a
shortcut
to
imposing
responsibility
primarily
upon
the
local.
we
never
objected
to
the
international
approving
the
contract
before
it
was
signed
--
mr.
james
davis
the
international?
mr.
james
davis
not
as
a
party,
as
approving
it,
as
controlling
its
terms,
as
anything
else.
but
the
only
reason
we
wanted
the
local
to
sign
it
was
to
fix
the
responsibility
primarily
--
mr.
james
davis
--
there.
mr.
james
davis
in
fairness.
mr.
james
davis
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
we
did
but
it
--
with
--
with
the
reverse
twist.
in
fairness,
we
insisted
that
the
local
sign
the
contract
as
the
party,
that
the
party
be
identified
in
its
local
name
and
we're
perfectly
willing
and
express
the
willingness
that
the
--
before
so
doing,
the
contract
should
be
approved
and
approved
with
the
signature
for
approval,
but
not
as
the
primary
responsible
party
by
the
international.
that
is
--
that
was
our
position
at
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
james
davis
mr.
justice
--
mr.
james
davis
no,
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
you.
mr.
james
davis
i'm
not
trying
to
--
mr.
james
davis
well,
they
are
not
words.
they
are
not
words.
we
conceive
the
--
the
international
and
the
--
and
the
local
--
mr.
james
davis
--
not
as
separate
--
not
as
separate
entities
but
as
one.
mr.
james
davis
and
--
mr.
james
davis
and
we
asked
that
they
sign
in
the
name
of
the
local
for
the
purpose
of
placing
the
emphasis
there.
that's
--
