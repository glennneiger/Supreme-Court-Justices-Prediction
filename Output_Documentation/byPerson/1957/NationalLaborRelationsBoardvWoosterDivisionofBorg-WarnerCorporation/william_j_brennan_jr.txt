justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
to
that
--
that's
all
derived
exclusively
from
the
form
of
the
certification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
it
was
derived
actually
from
the
certification,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
the
international
was
certified
following
the
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
insistence
of
the
company
upon
a
contract
with
someone
not
the
international
was
what
was
held
to
be
the
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
isn't
it
--
isn't'
it
now
pretty
much
a
practice,
mr.
manoli,
that
the
international
where
it
has
the
certification
wants
the
contract
for
internal
administrative
reason
within
the
union
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wants
to
be
the
party
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
contract
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
where
it
has
the
certification,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
are
matters
of
internal
union
administration
which
you
account
for
that
aren't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose,
mr.
manoli,
that
--
i
don't
know
if
i
quite
follow
this.
you
said
that
the
board
has
feeling
that
it
may
be
lawful
for
the
employer
to
propose
and
for
the
bargaining
agent
to
agree
to
accept
such
a
appellate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i'm
to
concur
from
that
that
this
is
a
demand
on
the
part
of
the
employer
which
the
board
believes
it's
within
the
permissible
area
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
how
can
it
can
be
lawful
for
the
union
or
--
employer
to
propose
and
the
union
to
accept
that
it's
not
within
the
permissible
area
collective-
bargaining.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
must
mean,
i'd
take
it,
your
position
is
that
this
particular
demand
is
never
at
any
time
within
the
area
of
permissible
collective-bargaining
--
i
don't
mean
permissible,
i
mean
compulsory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
--
there
may
be
another
area
called
permissible
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
collective
bargaining
that
we're
not
concerned
with.
but,
here
you
say,
in
any
event
it's
not
within
the
area
of
required
bargaining.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
any
if
at
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
all
of
events,
i
suppose
the
implication
of
mr.
adams
testimony
is
that
management
would
feel
either
strengthened
or
weakened
and
the
position
that
we're
taking
at
the
bargaining
table
depends
upon
the
outcome
of
that
referendum,
is
that
it?
and
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
the
referendum
was
favorable
to
the
companies
offer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
stand
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
this
time
--
wasn't
this
some
legislative
proposal
along
the
line
of
the
appellate
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
is
the
signatory
for
the
union
there
and
also
the
local?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
manoli.
there
used
to
be
as
i
recall
it
a
rather
detailed
analysis
of
the
filed
contracts.
i
think
at
least
to
be
filed
with
the
department
of
labor,
that
still
are,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
has
any
--
any
specific
analysis
been
made
of
comparing
--
by
comparing
certifications
with
the
signatory
to
the
contract
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
not
anything.
