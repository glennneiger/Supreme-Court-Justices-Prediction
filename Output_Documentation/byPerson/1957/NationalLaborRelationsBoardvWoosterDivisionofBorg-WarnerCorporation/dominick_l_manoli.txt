mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
it
presents
two
questions.
the
first
of
these
is
whether
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
an
employer
may
insist
as
a
condition
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
that
the
bargaining
representative
agree
not
to
call
a
strike
over
any
dispute
which
the
parties
aren't
able
to
settle
through
negotiations
including
the
termination
or
modification
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
until
all
of
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
have
had
an
opportunity
to
vote
on
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
company's
last
offer.
the
second
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
act,
an
employer
may
insist
that
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
be
between
the
company,
the
employer,
the
employer
and
the
local
and
the
international
rather
than
the
international
which
the
board
has
certified
as
the
employees'
bargaining
representative.
in
other
words,
the
question
here
is
whether
a
bargaining
representative
under
our
statute
is
required
to
bargain
about
proposals
of
this
character.
for
convenience,
i
would
like
to
refer
these
--
to
these
two
proposals
as
the
ballot
clause.
this
is
so-called
strike
vote
clause
and
the
other
one
as
the
recognition
clause.
briefly,
the
board
held
that
the
employer's
insistence
upon
these
two
clauses,
as
a
condition
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
violated
the
bargaining
requirements
of
the
statute.
the
court
below,
on
the
other
hand,
while
agreeing
with
the
board
with
respect
to
the
recognition
clause
that
the
employer's
insistence
upon
having
this
contract
solely
with
the
local
rather
than
the
international
which
you
can
certify,
did
violate
the
bargaining
requirements
of
the
statute,
disagreed
with
the
board
with
respect
to
the
ballot
clause
and
held
that
it
was
permissible
for
the
employer
to
insist
upon
the
ballot
clause.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
these
two
questions
that
are
before
us
are
not
in
dispute
and
i
shall
summarize
them
quite
briefly.
in
1952,
following
the
election
among
the
company's
employees,
the
board
certified
as
their
bargaining
representative
the
international
union
united
automobile
workers.
shortly
after
the
international
was
certified,
it
chartered
a
local
which
admitted
to
membership
employees
of
a
company
at
this
particular
plant.
shortly
after
the
local
had
been
charted
and
the
representatives
of
the
international,
the
local,
and
the
company,
beginning
in
1953,
entered
into
negotiations
for
the
purpose
of
consummating
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
these
negotiations
continued
for
a
period
of
several
months
and
finally
culminated
in
an
unsuccessful
strike.
at
the
end
of
the
unsuccessful
strike
the
local
--
the
local
but
not
the
international,
the
local
accepted
the
company's
terms
including
the
two
clauses
that
i've
mentioned
and
the
men,
of
course,
returned
to
work.
now,
going
back
to
the
negotiations
and
what
took
place
there
at
the
beginning
of
the
negotiations,
the
international
proposed
a
contract
which
would
be
between
the
company,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
international
and
it's
local
as
co-parties.
the
international
also
proposed
to
the
company
a
“no-strike”
clause
with
respect
to
matters
which
would
be
the
subject
matter
of
arbitration
under
its
proposed
contract.
the
company,
on
the
other
hand,
proposed
a
contract
which
named
only
the
local
of
the
international
as
the
party
to
the
contract.
more
specifically,
the
company's
proposal,
which
designating
the
union
as
the
party
to
the
contract
designated
as
“local
1238
affiliated
with
international
union,
united
automobile
workers”.
the
company
also
proposed
that
in
case
of
a
dispute
between
the
parties
which
they
were
unable
to
resolve
through
negotiation
that
the
union
would
not
call
a
strike
until
the
company's
last
offer
had
been
submitted
to
the
--
to
the
employees
for
them
to
vote
as
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
company's
last
offer.
in
the
event
that
the
majority
of
the
employees
rejected
the
company's
offer,
then
the
company
was
to
have
a
--
an
opportunity
of
submitting
a
further
proposal
within
72
hours
and
the
employees
were
again
to
be
given
an
opportunity,
all
of
the
employees
in
the
unit,
both
non
--
both
members
of
the
union
as
well
as
nonmembers.
all
of
them
will
have
a
further
opportunity
to
vote
on
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
company's
proposals.
the
company
explained
these
two
proposals
in
this
fashion.
it
--
it
explained
this
--
the
so-called
recognition
clause
that
the
contract
should
be
with
the
local
rather
than
certified
international
on
the
ground
that
the
local
was
more
familiar
with
the
local
plant
conditions
and
that
therefore
it
should
have
the
right
to
have
its
own
contract.
it
explained
the
strike
ballot
clause
on
two
grounds.
first
of
all,
that
it
would
enable
it
to
have
a
better
understanding
of
what
the
employees
wanted
and
that
it
would
permit
the
company
to
reexamine
if
necessary
its
position
in
the
light
of
their
wishes.
and
secondly,
that
it
was
designed
to
prevent
--
i
think
to
where
they
put
was
a
--
a
well
disciplined
minority
from
stacking
union
meetings
and
calling
unwanted
strikes.
the
--
in
the
negotiations
which
follow,
i
might
say
the
union
rejected
both
proposals.
in
the
negotiations
which
followed,
the
company
continued
to
insist
upon
these
two
clauses.
it
made
a
slight
modification
in
the
so-called
recognition
clause
and
to
change
the
recognition
clause
so
that
--
that
the
union
would
be
designated
as
local
1238
of
international
union,
united
automobile
workers
instead
of
local
1238
affiliated
with.
but
the
change,
nevertheless,
continued
to
reflect
the
company's
stated
purpose
that
the
contract
should
be
with
the
local
rather
than
the
international
which
the
board
had
certified.
the
company
also
modified
somewhat
it's
--
the
ballot
clause
so
that
to
--
in
--
so
that,
and
perhaps
i
omitted
this,
that
the
original
ballot
proposal
as
proposed
by
the
company
further
provided
that
the
contract
was
not
to
be
terminated
until
after
the
employees
are
also
--
have
a
vote
--
to
vote
upon
that
matter.
in
its
final
revision
of
this
proposal
the
company
included
the
question
of
--
of
amendment
and
or
modification
of
the
contract
as
well
as
its
termination.
in
other
words,
before
the
contract
could
be
--
if
there
dispute
as
to
the
terminating
or
modifying
the
contract
the
company's
final
proposal
or
it
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
employees
for
a
vote
as
to
whether
they
accept
or
reject.
the
--
throughout
the
negotiations
the
company
made
it
clear
that
agreement
was
contingent
upon
the
union's
acceptance
of
these
clauses,
these
so-called
ballot
and
recognition
clauses.
the
union
for
it
part
resisted
these
two
proposals,
informed
the
company
that
agreement
would
not
be
possible
as
long
as
this
company
insisted
on
either
one
of
them,
inferred
that
the
employees
were
prepared
to
strike
over
either
one
of
these
proposals.
the
company
and
the
union
were
also
--
and
lowered
their
heads
on
other
matters
and
as
a
consequence
a
strike
was
called
and
the
strike,
as
i've
indicated,
was
unsuccessful
and
at
the
conclusion
for
the
strike
the
local,
but
not
the
international,
accepted
the
company's
terms
including
the
so-called
ballot
and
recognition
clauses.
the
international
did
not
--
was
not
a
party
to
the
final
agreement
which
was
signed
between
the
company
and
the
local.
now,
as
i've
indicated,
briefly,
few
minutes
ago,
the
board
held
that
the
company's
insistence
upon
these
two
clauses
as
a
condition
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
violated
the
bargaining
requirements
of
the
statute.
more
specifically,
the
board
held
that
these
two
clauses
affect
the
bargaining
representative's
status
as
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
the
employees
that
this
status
does
relate
to
terms
or
conditions
of
employment.
and
that,
therefore,
the
union
was
not
required
to
bargain
with
respect
to
these
--
to
these
matters
and
that
the
company
by
insisting
upon
bargaining,
by
insisting
upon
these
two
clauses
as
a
condition
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
in
effect,
was
refusing
to
accord
to
the
union
the
full
and
exclusive
recognition
which
--
to
which
it
is
entitled
to,
to
which
it
is
entitled
under
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir.
the
company's
insistence
upon
these
two
clauses
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
court
below,
to
explain
it
a
little
more
fully
its
position,
as
i've
said
before,
accepted
part
of
the
board's
case
but
rejected
the
other.
they
accepted
the
board's
position
that
insofar
as
the
company
here
was
insistent
of
this
contract
to
be
with
the
local
rather
than
the
international
which
i
say
the
board
had
certified,
that
the
company
had
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practice.
and
courts
agreed
with
us,
that
the
union
status
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
entitled
it
to
be
a
party
to
the
contract
and
that
the
company's
insistence
upon
excluding
it
from
the
contract
from
being
a
party
to
the
contract,
in
effect,
was
tantamount
to
a
failure
to
give
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
from
the
statute
and
the
certification.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
the
company's
proposal
only
the
local
would
be
a
party.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
have
searched
for
material
on
that
and
the
latest
study
that
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
was
made
sometime
in
1941.
and
that
study
indicates
that
the
--
the
practice
then
was
for
contracts
to
be
entered
into
both
parties,
the
international
and
the
locals
as
co-parties.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
the
union
as
i
indicated
here
made
that
proposal
here
that
the
local
be
included
as
a
co-party
but
the
company's
proposal
was
to
exclude
the
international
and
have
only
the
local
as
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
co-party.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
inclusion
of
the
local?
well,
i
suppose
that
they
do
have
some
interest
in
--
in
the
contract
which
is
made
and
it
gives
the
local
with
some
standing,
some
standing.
now,
usually
the
--
where
you
have
a
local
which
is
certified,
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
the
international
should
go
on
because
the
employees
are
insistent
the
international
presumably
a
more
responsible
party
should
be
a
party
to
the
contract.
and
on
the
other
hand,
where
you
have
an
international
which
has
been
certified,
seems
--
seemingly
the
practice
is
for
the
unions
to
propose
that
the
local
also
be
made
parties
to
the
contract
and
it
gives
them
some
kind
of
standing
in
prestige.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
they're
not.
no,
no
they're
not
[laughs]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
the
international
be
a
party?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
party
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
this
particular
international,
for
example,
well,
always
goes
on
the
contract.
it
will
--
when
--
when
there
has
been
a
--
when
there
has
been
local
which
is
in
the
picture
it
may
propose
that
the
local
come
into
the
--
come
in
--
come
in
on
the
contract
but
it
never
relinquishes.
this
international
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
are
because
in
this
fashion
the
international
gets
control
over
the
contract
and
how
it's
administered
whereas,
otherwise,
it
might
very
well
lose
control
of
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i
--
i
think
so.
the
--
coming
now
to
statement
of
our
reasons
here
for,
i
think
that
the
court
was
--
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
--
in
one
aspect
of
this
case
and
right
on
the
other
as
had
--
it
probably
did
not
indicate.
we
are
here
complaining
about
the
court's
ruling
with
respect
to
the
ballot
clause.
but
we
--
the
other
side
is
complaining
with
respect
to
the
court's
ruling
as
to
the
recognition
clause.
we
won,
in
other
words,
on
the
recognition
clause
and
laws
under
ballot
clause.
i
suppose
analysis
of
the
two
questions
which
confront
us
here
begins
with
a
brief
restatement
of
the
collective
bargaining
principle
which
the
statute
has
defined
and
is
further
explicated
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
statute
provides
that
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
--
that
the
bargaining
representative,
designator
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
a
particular
bargaining
unit
shall
be
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
the
employees
in
the
unit
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
with
respect
to
rates
and
hours
of
pay
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
the
--
the
central
concept
of
the
statute
in
this
respect,
is,
that
the
bargaining
representative
speaks
for
all
of
the
employees
in
the
unit.
and
that
provided
that
it
deals
fairly
with
the
interest
of
all
of
them
that
it
has
the
authority
to
enter
into
binding
and
final
commitments
on
their
behalf.
the
authority
of
the
bargaining
representative
to
speak
for
and
bind
all
of
the
employees
in
the
unit
may
perhaps,
without
pushing
the
analogy
too
far,
may
be
compared
to
the
powers
which
are
vested
in
a
legislative
body.
for
as
this
court
had
said,
congress
has
seen
fit
to
uphold
the
bargaining
representative
with
powers
comparable
to
a
legislative
body
both
to
create
and
restrict
the
rights
of
those
whom
it
represents.
it
is
for
the
bargaining
representative,
under
this
scheme
--
under
this
scheme,
which
congress
has
set
forth
in
this
statute.
it
is
for
the
bargaining
representative
to
formulate
demands,
to
accept
or
reject
what
the
company
--
what
the
employer
proposes.
in
a
word
control
of
the
employee
side
of
the
bargaining
table
is
lodged
in
the
bargaining
representative.
by
the
same
token,
the
employer
is
under
a
duty,
as
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
quite
plain,
he's
under
a
duty
to
accord
to
the
bargaining
representative
full
and
exclusive
recognition
to
recognize
the
bargaining
representative
has
full
and
exclusive
control
of
the
employee
side
of
the
bargaining
table
and
finally
that
the
employer
may
not
deal
directly
with
the
employees.
now,
how
does
the
recognition
clause
or
rather,
how
does
the
ballot
clause
fit
into
this
statutory
scheme?
the
ballot
clause
in
affect
provides
for
a
referendum
by
the
employees
to
register
their
approval
or
disapproval
of
their
representative
decision
at
the
bargaining
table
and
to
register
their
approval
or
disapproval
with
the
respect
to
determination
or
the
modification
of
the
agreement.
now,
we
believe
that
the
company's
insistence
upon
a
clause
of
this
character,
upon
a
referendum
of
this
kind,
involves
a
diminution
of
the
bargaining
representative
part,
exclusive
part
to
deal
with
the
employer
on
matters
of
collective
bargaining.
and
further
that
it
represents
an
intrusion
into
the
internal
affairs
of
the
bargaining
representative
and
that
the
employer
may
not
insist
upon
bargaining
about
these
matters
and
that
union
is
not
compelled
to
bargaining
about
it.
now,
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
a
clause
of
this
kind,
that
a
ballot
proposal
of
this
kind
permits
the
employer
in
a
very
real,
in
a
very
practical
sense,
to
deal
directly
with
the
employees
himself.
by
the
same
token
it
permits
the
employees
to
deal
with
the
employer
directly
rather
than
as
the
statute
contemplates
and
requires
through
their
bargaining
representative.
the
very
proposal
itself,
i
think,
indicates
that
the
employer
is
--
is
seeking
to
bargain
with
the
employees
directly.
he
would
make
one
offer.
if
that
offer
was
rejected
then
he
would
make
a
further
offer
for
the
employees
to
vote.
and
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
a
ballot
device
enables
the
employer
to
deal
directly
with
the
employees
on
matters
of
collective
bargaining,
is,
i
think,
emphasized
by
the
company's
own
explanation
as
to
what
this
clause
was
intended
to
do.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
contract
says
twice
and
then
it
doesn't
make
any
further
provision
as
to
whether
there
could
be
a
third
or
not.
it's
simply
--
the
contract
simply
provides
that
he
could
make
the
first
offer.
if
that
was
rejected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees,
then
within
72
hours,
the
company
would
have
the
opportunity
to
present
a
further
proposal
and
the
employers
would
vote
and
beyond
that
the
contract
says
nothing.
have
i
answered
your
question,
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
do
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
board
has
recognized
that
it
may
be
quite
lawful
for
the
employer
to
propose
of
contract
--
an
agreement
of
this
sort
and
it
may
be
lawful
for
the
--
for
the
union
to
accept
it.
but
where
it
becomes
bad
is
when
the
employer,
in
the
face
of
the
union's
opposition,
on
the
face
of
representative's
opposition
that
it
does
not
wish
to
bargain
about
that,
that
the
employer
continues
to
press
with
the
demand.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
board
feels
that
while
the
union
may
have
the
capacity
to
waive
this
--
to
waive
this
right
to
--
to
be
the
--
to
have
full
and
exclusive
control
over
the
employee
side
of
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
--
right.
that's
right.
that
it
under
the
act
as
i've
sought
to
indicate
the
bargaining
representative
has
complete
control
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
before
he
sat
at
the
bargaining
table.
and
as
we
see
this
proposal
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
i'm
just
trying
to
indicate
to
your
honor
here
that
this
proposal
detracts
from
the
control
which
the
statute
gives
to
the
bargaining
representative
over
the
bargaining
negotiation
that
it
detracts
from
that
because
it
enables
the
employer
to
deal
directly
with
the
employees
himself.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
put
this
to
example,
your
honor.
a
union
might
propose,
for
example,
propose
to
the
employer
that
it
should
bargain
about
the
salary
which
had
been
paid
to
officers.
obviously,
that's
not
within
the
area
of
compulsory
collective-bargaining
as
is
defined
by
the
statute.
if
the
employer
wishes
to
bargain
about
that
is
--
it's
--
is
not
unlawful
for
the
union
to
propose
it.
if
the
employer
wishes
to
bargain
about
that
if
--
there's
nothing
unlawful
in
its
doing
so.
but
yet
in
view
of
the
statutory
scheme
that
there
are
only
certain
matters
as
to
which
you
can
be
compelled
to
bargain
is
that
we
compel
to
bargain.
once
the
union
or
the
employer
as
the
case
may
be
and
in
fact
put
up
a
stop
sign
and
says
we
don't
to
discuss
this
proposal
and
that
proposal
does
not
fall
within
the
area
of
compulsory
collective-bargaining
then
the
one
side
of
the
other
is
not
--
is
one
--
the
union
is
not
required
to
bargain
about
it
and
the
employer
may
not
insist
upon
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right
i'm
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
precisely.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
precisely.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
is,
however,
your
honor,
if
i
may
jump
over
conceivable
matters
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(voice
overlap)
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no,
i
would
like
answer
your
question
briefly
at
this
moment
then
i'll
try
to
fill
in
the
steps
how
i
get
in
there.
but
while
it
--
obviously,
it's
not
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
it
does
not
fall,
so
we
say,
within
the
area
of
compulsory
bargaining
as
defined
by
the
statute.
because
the
area
of
compulsory
bargaining
as
defined
by
the
statute
relates
to
terms,
rates
of
pay,
hours
and
other
conditions
of
employment.
now,
if
i
may
go
back,
now,
as
to
why
we
think
this
is
not,
why
this
kind
of
a
demand
is
not
within
those
--
that
area
of
compulsory
bargaining.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
that
this
kind
of
a
proposal
permits
the
employer
to
deal
directly
with
the
employees
and
i
think
if
that
is
--
that
our
view
of
that
is
practiced
by
company's
own
explanation
as
to
what
this
proposal
--
this
with
the
strike
proposal
was
intended
to
accomplish.
the
principal
negotiator
for
the
company
is
testifying
and
he
says,
this
is
at
page
318
of
the
record.
“i
think
that”
--
about
four
lines
from
the
top,
i'm
beginning
in
a
middle
of
a
sentence
there.
“i
think
that
this
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
strike
was
really
related
to
whether
or
not
the
management
was
doing
a
good
job
of
managing
the
business
at
least
so
far
as
it's
relation
with
the
people
were
concerned
and
that
he”
is,
the
he
is
the
person
of
the
company
who
had
previously
testified.
“and
that
he
felt
pretty
much”
as
he
stated
in
--
know
--
in
his
own
testimony
that
if
a
majority
of
bargaining
unit
were
opposed
to
the
particular
proposal
that
was
presented
at
the
moment
that
management
ought
to
reexamine
its
own
position.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
it
developed
that
a
majority
of
the
people
were
not
opposes
to
management's
action
in
any
particular
respect
that
was
a
pretty
good
indication
that
management
was
doing
a
good
job.
now,
i
think
that
the
buttresses
our
view
as
to
what
is
accomplished
by
this
kind
of
a
device.
that
the
employer
--
it
enables
the
employer
to
deal
directly
with
the
employees
and
this
is
contrary
to
the
statutory
scheme.
beyond
this,
beyond
this,
we
think
that
a
proposal
of
this
kind
compels,
the
bargaining
representative,
at
least,
in
part
to
surrender
the
exclusive
control
which
the
statute
confers
upon
it
over
the
employees'
side
of
the
bargaining
table.
our
device
to
this
kind
introduces
an
element
of
competition
if
i
may
say
so
and
it
lodges
in
a
very
real
sense,
it
lodges
in
a
very
real
sense.
a
veto
power
in
a
group
of
employees
whether
they
be
the
minority
or
they
be
union
members
or
nonunion
members
who
can
muster
a
current
majority
against
the
representative
and
outvote
it
or
vote
to
override
it
on
a
particular
issue.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
a
study
made
in
1953,
your
honor,
out
of
400
contracts,
5%
of
these
contracts
were
found
to
have
a
provision
with
--
with
respect
to
the
strike
of
these.
of
those
--
of
that
5%,
2%
of
the
study
goes
on
to
say,
2%
reflected
the
--
or
restated
the
union's
own
practice
with
respect
to
holding
of
--
of
vote
therein
before
going
out
on
a
strike.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
the
section?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
no
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
statute,
of
course,
provides
for
a
cooling
off
period
of
a
certain
amount
of
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
for
certain
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
amount
of
time
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
yes
they
would
be.
yes,
they
would
be
because
--
because
that
kind
of
a
clause,
your
honor,
does
not
--
does
not
in
anyway.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i
think
that
their
--
i
hope
my
judgment
would
be
--
that
it
would
be
all
right
to
have
a
cooling
off
period
or
an
employer
to
insist
upon
a
cooling
off
period
beyond
wherever
the
statutory
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
defined.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
we
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what
in
a
sense,
your
honor?
perhaps
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
that
the
union
was
not
compelled
to
respect
the
vote
as
a
matter
of
contract.
in
other
words,
under
the
contract
the
union
presumably
was
free
even
after
a
majority
had
voted
to
accept
the
company's
proposal
was
still
free
to
call
a
strike.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
should
be
under
any
illusions
about
the
practical
--
what
--
what
become
--
what
the
parties
really
intended
and
thought
that
this
was
going
to
accomplished.
i
think
it
was
understood
by
them,
even
though
i
can't
point
anything
in
the
record.
it
definitely
says
so
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
--
to
assume
that
it
was
understood
by
them
that
a
vote
would
be
decisive
on
this
matter.
and
as
a
matter
of
practical
--
as
a
matter
of
industrial
realities,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
union
to
call
a
strike.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
face
of
an
adverse
vote.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
would
stand
on
its
offer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
in
effect,
the
employers
would
have
made
the
decision
rather
than
the
bargaining
representative.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is.
that's
where
the
statute
is
--
is
working
may
be
good,
may
be
bad
but
it
has
to
be
a
mandate.
i
think
it's
a
legislative
problem.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
--
when
the
taft-hartley
amendments
were
be
considered
your
honor,
the
house
bill
proposed
that
there
should
be
a
vote
by
the
employees
on
the
company's
last
offer
before
going
out
on
strike.
those
proposals
were
rejected.
they
never
found
their
way
into
this
--
into
our
statute.
now,
there
are
two
other
sections
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
that
do
deal
with
the
strike
votes.
one
is
in
connection
with
the
conciliation
service
203
i
believe.
it
is
section
203
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
permits
the
conciliation
service
to
suggest
to
parties
who
are
involved
in
some
kind
of
a
dispute
to
have
a
voluntary
--
to
accept
or
to
adapt
voluntarily
this
--
this
vote
--
strike
vote
matter
and
then
also
there's
a
further
provision
in
connection
with
the
--
with
strikes
involving
the
national
health
and
welfare
which
permit
the
government
to
get
an
80-day
injunction
at
the
--
on
the
60th
day
of
that
injunction,
there
was
requirement
that
a
--
both
shall
be
taken
of
the
employees
on
the
company's
last
offer.
but
with
respect
to
our
statute,
there
was
a
provision
as
i
say
in
the
house
bill
in
1947
which
would
have
made
it
mandatory
to
hold
such
a
vote
by
the
employees
on
the
company's
last
offer
and
that
was
not
done.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
it
was
a
separate
section,
your
honor,
that
dealt
with
this
in
connection
with
the
duty
to
bargain
and
there
was
a
separate
section
of
this
spelling
out
in
detail
all
the
various
steps
until
they
finally
they
had
to
do
this.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
precisely.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
precisely.
now,
as
i
would
say
--
i
was
saying
a
moment
ago,
this
is
sort
of
a
vote
introduces
an
element
of
competition
you
might
say
between
the
bargaining
representative
and
whatever
group
of
employee
and
the
employees.
and
that
it
lodges
a
veto
power
in
the
group
of
employees
whether
they
be
union
or
nonunion
if
they
can
muster
a
majority
against
union
on
that
particular
proposition.
and
then
the
effect
of
this
is
--
the
effect
of
this
is.
now,
a
vote
by
the
employees
on
these
circumstances
would
not
be
a
mere
gallop
hole.
the
union
could
hardly
insist
upon
its
position
vis-a-vis
the
employer.
once
there
had
been
an
adverse
vote
against
its
position
in
a
vote
of
this
--
in
vote
of
his
character.
so
that
in
sum,
in
essence
what
this
proposal
does
is
shift
control
of
the
bargaining
from
the
bargaining
representative
as
required
conferred
by
the
statute
from
the
bargaining
representative
to
whatever
group
of
employee
can
have
--
can
muster
majority.
they
muster
majority
against
the
bargaining
representative
position
on
that
particular
dispute.
the
handle
which
a
valid
device
of
this
kind
furnished
to
an
employer
for
supporting
the
differences
between
the
employees
and
the
bargaining
representative
and
in
pairing
the
effectiveness
of
the
bargaining
representative
at
the
bargaining
table,
if
i'm
--
i
think
suggested
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
international
won
the
election
by
a
very
narrow
margin
out
of
some
90
odd
votes
the
international
here
received
some
48
votes
as
against
45
votes
for
a
rival,
for
rival
union.
in
other
words,
international
here
won
by
three
votes.
i
think
it
is
not
unfair
to
suggest
that
here
is
potentially
at
least
a
hardcore
of
opposition
to
the
bargaining
representative.
a
mere
shift
of
a
few
votes,
you
could
be
--
can
muster
a
majority
against
the
union.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
--
this
case,
this
case
demonstrates
the
possibilities
for
exploitation
that
it
enables
--
that
--
that
it
followed
device
of
this
kind
permits
an
employer
to
--
to
engage
in.
in
essence
what
we're
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
we
think
that
the
company's
insistence
upon
these
--
this
clause,
the
recognition
clause
in
effect
was
tantamount
that
towards
an
insistence
that
the
bargaining
representative
weigh,
weigh
the
powers
which
it
has
under
this
statute,
namely,
it's
the
exclusive
control
over
the
employee
side
of
the
bargaining
table.
now,
if
we
are
right
in
that.
if
we
are
right
in
the
analysis
that
that
is
what
the
ballot
clause
accomplishes
that
is
an
insistence
upon
a
waiver
of
the
union's
right
to
have
exclusive
control
of
the
employees
side
of
bargaining
table
then
we
think
and
i
can
now
come
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
then
we
think
that
this
is
not
a
matter
as
to
which
the
company
can
insist
that
the
union
bargain.
the
statute
defines
as
an
area
--
as
the
area
of
compulsory
bargaining
or
let
me
put
at
this.
the
area
which
the
statute
defines
is
the
subject
to
compulsory
bargaining
relates
to
hours,
rates
of
pay
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
with
respect
to
those
matters,
either
side
may
propose,
and
as
long
as
it
is
acting
in
good
faith,
stick
to
its
proposal
doesn't
have
to
concede.
that,
i
think,
is
the
teaching
of
this
--
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
american
national.
and
while
i'm
in
american
national,
i
do
want
to
say
if
he
words
here
on
that
--
about
that
case
because
it's
quite
so
important
a
part
in
the
adverse
decisions
that
we've
had
on
this
problem.
now,
of
course,
it
plays
a
very
important
role
in
the
company's
brief.
we
think
that
american
national
is
distinguishable
from
this
case.
in
the
american
national,
the
court
will
recall
the
employer
was
insistent
that
the
contract
included
a
so
called
management
--
management
functions
prerogative
or
something,
something
of
that
sort
whereby
--
whereby
the
employer
alone
would
handle
matters
relating
to
discipline,
production
--
scheduled
productions
and
promotions.
the
union,
on
the
other
hand,
insisted
it
would
--
whenever
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
these
matters,
it
should
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
now,
this
court
--
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
the
employer
as
long
as
he
was
acting
in
good
faith
could
insist
upon
those
--
upon
its
proposal
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
these
matters.
as
this
court
solved
the
case,
there's
the
majority
this
court
solved
the
cases.
these
basic
items
as
to
which
there
was
a
dispute
namely,
the
scheduling
of
production,
promotions,
disciplinary
matters.
they
related
to
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
that
therefore
the
employer
as
long
as
he
was
acting
in
good
faith
could
insist
upon
those
demands.
here,
however,
though,
we
do
not
have
a
matter
that
relates
to
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
what
we
do
have
is
a
matter
that
relates
to
the
union's
status
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees.
the
union
achieves
this
status
as
a
matter
of
right
once
it
has
won
an
election.
and
the
--
it's
--
it's
status
--
it
is
not
a
negotiable
item
under
the
statute.
the
employer
doesn't
have
the
option
of
saying,
i
will
bargain
with
you
as
to
whether
i
will
give
you
the
full
and
exclusive
recognition
which
the
statute
says
you're
entitled
to
as
to
matter
of
right.
if
that
were
so,
it
would
mean
that
the
union,
the
bargaining
representative
would
have
to
defend
at
the
bargaining
table
what's
its
victory
could
pose
and
the
statute
has
assured
that
it
is
a
matter
of
right.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
on
this
proposition.
the
company
argues
first,
that
there's
really
no
question
of
recognition
involved
in
this
case.
and
their
argument,
therefore,
falls.
that
what
they
have
here
is
something
in
the
nature
of
a
qualified
“no-strike”
clause.
and
that
since
a
“no-strike”
clause
is
a
subject
matter
of
collective
bargaining,
there's
no
phases
upon
which
to
distinguish
since
that
situation
and
this
situation.
there
is
a
surface
--
a
certain
amount
surface
plausibility
of
this
argument,
indeed
enough
i
guess
to
have
appealed
through
two
courts,
the
seventh
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
because
they've
adopted
this
--
this
approach.
despite
the
surface
appeal,
if
i
may
say
so,
we
think
that
the
argument
overlooks
decisive
differences
between
the
“no-strike”
clause
and
the
clause
which
we
have
here.
the
employees
entrust
to
their
bargaining
representative
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
strike.
they
authorize
the
bargaining
representative
to
either
retain
that
--
that
right
or
to
wait
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
concessions
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
a
concession
of
this
kind
by
the
union,
by
the
representative
involves
no
diminution
you
might
say
of
its
status.
but
here
though,
on
our
analysis
that
any
rate,
upon
our
analysis,
the
ballot
clause
in
effect
calls
upon
the
union
to
surrender
the
very
power
of
decision
which
the
statute
confers
upon
it
with
respect
to
collective-bargaining
matters.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
whether
it's
the
--
are
you
making
a
distinction,
your
honor,
between
union
membership
and
nonunion
membership.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
our
answer
would
be
the
same
there.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
would
be
the
same.
the
further
argument
which
the
company
has
made,
and
i've
already
touched
upon
it
briefly,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
internal
inconsistency
in
the
board's
position,
namely,
the
board
recognizes
that
it's
lawful
for
the
employer
to
make
a
proposal
of
this
kind.
that
it's
lawful
for
the
bargaining
represented
to
accept
it.
but
the
company
says
despite
this
recognition
by
the
board
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
proposal
and
lawfulness
of
acceptance,
nevertheless,
the
board
goes
on
to
say
that
the
employer
can't
insist
upon
this
kind
of
a
proposal
as
a
condition
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
well,
your
honor
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
a
union
may
not
like
capacity
to
waive
some
right
that
it
has
under
the
statute.
but
i
submit
that
the
option
is
--
the
option
that
the
--
that
waiver
is
the
option
of
a
bargaining
representative
and
not
of
that
of
the
employer
because
if
the
employer
could
do
this,
it
would
mean
--
it
would
mean
that
in
--
in
essence
that
the
employer
has
the
option
of
bargaining
as
to
whether
or
not
he
will
give
the
bargaining
representative
the
kind
of
recognition
that
is
entitled
to
under
the
statute.
let
me
go
on
now
to
the
second
question.
let
me
go
on
now
to
the
second
question
which
is
presented
by
this
case.
and
that
is,
whether
the
company
could
insist
that
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
be
with
the
local,
rather
than
the
international
which
the
board
has
certified
as
the
employer's
exclusive
representative.
as
i
have
previously
stated,
the
board
certified
the
international
after
an
election
among
the
company's
employees
and
the
international
charted
the
local
after
the
international
itself
had
been
certified.
the
union
proposed
originally
that
the
contract
that
they
were
the
company
on
the
one
hand
and
the
international
and
the
local
as
co-parties.
the
company
on
the
other
hand,
insisted
that
the
contract
be
with
the
local,
rather
than
the
international.
the
company
seeks
to
defend
its
proposal
in
this
respect
that
on
the
ground
that
the
clause
which
it
proposed,
the
so-called
recognition
clause,
that
it
proposed
was
a
mere
identification
clause.
if
that
is
all
it
was,
it
seems
rather
odd,
that
it
should
have
proved
to
be
such
a
stumbling
block
in
these
negotiations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
certificate,
your
honor,
is
at
page
33
of
the
--
33
of
the
record.
and
the
certificate
certified
that
a
majority
--
towards
the
--
five
to
six
lines
from
the
bottom,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
international
union,
united
automobile
and
so
forth.
and
in
this
connection,
your
honor
will
--
which
your
honors
will
take
a
look
at
page
390
of
the
record
390,
390
of
the
record.
that
shows
the
first
proposal
which
was
made
by
the
company
and
about
--
so
this
agreement
is
they
entered
into
between
the
company
and
local
union
1239
affiliated
with
the
international
union,
united
automobile
et
cetera.
and
then
its
kind
of
second
and
its
final
proposal
which
the
local
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir
that's
right.
that's
right.
and
then
in
its
second
and
final
proposal
which
the
local
as
i
say
accepted
after
the
unsuccessful
strike
and
this
appears
--
the
so-called
recognition
clause,
if
may
refer
to
it,
is
that
it
appears
at
page
401
of
the
record.
that
the
only
change
that
was
made
there
was
that
instead
of
reading
local
union
1239,
affiliated
with,
it
now
reads
local
union
1239
of
the
united
automobile,
aircraft
and
agricultural
implement
workers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
recall.
i
don't
recall.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
as
i
was
saying
that
the
company
seeks
to
defend
this
on
the
ground
that
this
is
a
mere
identity
that
this
--
that
this
spurious,
one
of
mere
identification
of
the
union.
but
to
the
court
and
the
board
below
found
there
was
more
involved
here
than
a
mere
identification.
what
the
company
was
insisting
upon
here
is
excluding
all
together,
the
international
from
the
agreement.
and
as
it
said
in
its
own
words
that
the
local
--
that
the
local
should
have
the
right
to
make
its
own
contract.
now,
we
think
that
the
bargaining
representative
is
certainly
which
is
entitled
to
full
and
exclusive
recognition
on
the
statute
is
certainly
entitled
to
be
a
part
of
the
agreement,
to
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
and
that
when
an
employer
is
insisting
that
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
will
be
with
the
local,
rather
than
the
international
which
has
been
certified
by
the
board
that
he
is,
not
according
that
union
the
kind
of
recognition
that
the
statute
requires
that
he
has
to
accord
to
that
union.
and
that
this
will
also
relate
the
union's
statutory
status
and
that
this
is
just
--
not
fall
within
the
area
of
compulsory
collective-bargaining,
and
that
the
employer
may
not
insist
upon
a
clause
of
this
kind
as
a
condition
of
the
agreement.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
of
any
other
case
your
honor
involving
this
problem.
this
is
the
only
that
case
that
i
know
of
that
when
you
speak
of
this
problem
i
think
it
should
mean
the
party
to
the
agreement
problem.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
that's
right.
this
is
the
only
case
that
i
--
i
know.
it's
--
i
think
that
the
reason
for
that
probably
is,
your
honor,
that
it's
a
rare
case
where
the
employer
is
going
to
insist
that
the
certified
union
is
--
shall
not
be
a
party
to
the
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
international
would
have
no
legal
standing
upon
this
contract.
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
should
like
briefly
to
comment
on
two
things.
mr.
davis
has
indicated
this
union
has
bargained
and
accepted
the
strike
clause
such
as
we
have
in
this
contrary,
as
we
have
here.
he
mentioned
particularly
the
allis-chalmers
contract
that
this
union
has
with
our
company.
i
think
that
in
passing,
i
should
mention
that
the
union
filed
charges
against
the
company
in
that
case
in
--
on
the
basis
of
the
company's
insistence
upon
that
provision.
that
matter
was
litigated
to
the
board,
to
the
--
and
to
the
seventh
circuit.
and
of
course,
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
against
us
as
--
as
the
court
may
know.
now,
coming
back
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
put
insofar
as
i've
been
able
to
discover,
if
there
is
any
bargaining
with
respect
to
who
is
to
be
the
party
named
on
the
contract
the
bargain
has
been
whether
someone
in
addition
to
the
certified
representative
should
be
named.
for
example,
if
the
local
has
this
certificate,
whether
the
international
should
also
be
named
or
the
international
has
a
certificate
whether
the
local
should
also
be
named.
now,
in
this
connection,
i
should
like
to
read
what
the
bureau
of
national
fares
in
a
study
made
in
1956,
we
haven't
cited
this
in
our
brief,
but
i
will
supply
it
to
the
clerk
for
the
court's
convenience
if
i
may.
and
if
i
may
read
just
one
short
paragraph,
it
said
in
reports
that
under
the
taft
act,
the
business
of
writing
recognition
and
related
clauses
has
become
largely
routine
for
too
many
reasons.
first,
the
union
representing
a
majority
of
the
employers
in
the
appropriate
bargaining
union
must
be
recognized
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
and
second,
coverage
of
the
contract
is
fixed
to
a
large
degree
by
the
labor
of
board
determination
of
the
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
these
matters
become
largely
routine
that
it's
not
quite
accurate
to
say
that
these
become
subject
to
collective
bargaining
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
yes,
the
latest
study
that
we
were
able
to
obtain
other
than
this
statement
was
the
one
that
i
referred
to
yesterday
and
made
by
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
we
checked
that
specifically,
your
honor.
i
checked
that
in
preparation
for
this
argument.
i
wasn't
able
to
find
anything
like
that
over
there.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
apparently,
it's
not
been
a
problem
that
they
have
been
of
such
a
character
that
they
should
have
--
that
they
would
take
cognizance
of.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
the
board's
theory,
if
the
--
the
board
here
in
effect
said
--
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
here,
the
international
proposed
that
the
contract
should
be
with
the
international
and
the
local
as
a
co-party.
the
company
recognizes
that
while
the
union
could
make
that
proposal
that
the
employer
could
have
refused
to
pull
up
--
the
local
--
the
local
on
the
contract
since
it
was
not
the
certified
party.
and
so
here,
if
the
employer
had
insisted
on
having
the
local
and
the
international
as
co-parties
with
the
contract,
the
union
could
have
agreed
to
that
or
it
could
have
opposed.it
could
have
opposed
under
argued
the
--
making
the
local
which
was
not
the
certified
union
a
party
to
the
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
they
--
no,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
wouldn't
be
here
unless
the
employer
filed
charges
against
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(inaudible)
from
the
bargaining.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
we
would
not.
