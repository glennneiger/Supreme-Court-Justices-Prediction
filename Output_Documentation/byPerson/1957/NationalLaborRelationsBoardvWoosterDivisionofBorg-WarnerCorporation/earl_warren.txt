i
interrupt
just
a
moment
to
ask
you
--
chief

many
times
he

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
that
leads
to
--
would
that
lead
you
to
conclusion,
mr.
davis,
that
the
employer
could
insist
on
bargaining
with
either
that
he
wished
either
the
international
or
the
local
depending
upon
which
one
he
--
chief

you
insist
upon
a
clause
that

now,
mr.

chief
justice
earl

your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter
troubles
me
where
you
said
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
feel
you
had
to
meet
in
this
--
in
this
case,
the
question
that
he
asked
you
about
your
departure
from
--
from
dealing
with
the
--
the
certified
bargaining
agent.
now
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
--
as
i
read
this
certificate,
it
says
that
the
--
the
ballots
had
been
a
cast
for
international
union,
united
automobile
aircraft
and
agricultural
implement
workers
of
america
cio
and
that
pursuant

act
said
organization
is
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
the

how
--
what

you
the
power
to
overwrite

when
it
--
when
it
says
that
that
union
is
the
bargaining
agent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
certificate
says
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
mr.
manoli
to
say
that
you
refused
even
to
let
the
international

be
a
partner
in
this
contract.
chief

--
(voice

mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it
a
question
of
more
than
a
name.
isn't
it
a
--
isn't
--
aren't
they
two
different
representatives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
for
them
to
determine,
not
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
by
that
that
there
is
a
practice
of
employer
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
you
have
done
there
to
refuse
to
--
to
recognize
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
representative
that
--
that
has
been
certified.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
that
is
the
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
before
we
leave
that,
let's
take
a
situation
like
the
steel
industry
where
you
say
they
--
the
union
invariably
insist
that
they
--
they
--
the
contract
you
signed
with
the
international.
supposed
that's
a
matter
of
internal
organization
with
the
--
with
the
steelworkers
union
and
that
the
locals
have
no
right
to
--
to
bargain
separately.
do
you
still
insist
that
the
employer
would
have
the
right
to
bargain
and
--
on
that
question
and
insist
that
the
local
sign
the
contract
instead
of
the
international?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
i
--
i
want
the
certification
to
be
to
the
national
as
it
is
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's

chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
