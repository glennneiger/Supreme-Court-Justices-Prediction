justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
though
that
in
view
of
the
concession
that
section
vi
is
invalid,
would
be
no
occasion
for
you
to
argue
the
in
--
invalidity
of
that
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
--
i
--
i
didn't
intimate
that,
i
suggest
though
that
--
am
i
correct
that
in
the
light
of
the
concession
of
including
the
vi,
and
that's
not
now
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
if
that's
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
question
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
question
of
fees
before
us
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
in
any
even,
you
want
us
to
say
that
any
flat
fee,
even
a
dollar
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
wouldn't
make
the
section
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
flat
fee,
you
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
apply
to
10
cents
then,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
you
suppose
the
provision
for
a
license
and
the
section
vi
are
sufficiently
separable
that
provisions
for
licensing
may
be
valid
and
to
know
the
others
are
not,
i
know
your
position
is
they're
not
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
whether
in
place
of
the
--
face
to
the
flat
concession
of
the
invalidity
of
section
vi.
this
case
doesn't
now
come
down
to
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
license
provision
alone
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
not
a
reference
to
section
vi.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
anything
else,

justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
i
mean
in
this
case,
where

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
$300.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
you
have
the
boy
scouts,
the
girl
scouts

justice
william
j.
brennan,

(voice

and
things
like
that.
justice
william
