couldn't
be
any
different
if
a
northern
community
did
it,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
won't
--
she
won't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
believe
those
matters,
i
could
prove
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
before
--
before
you
conclude
what's
the
ordinance,
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
section
85
of
the
criminal
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you,
in
this
the
court
of
appeals,
argue
or
make
the
concession
that
you
made
here
that
section
vi
is
clearly
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
you
argue
the
merits,
the
--
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
entire
ordinance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
question
of
a
discriminatory
application
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that's
the
hale
case?
i
thought
the
hale
case
decided
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
confessions
of
error
such
on
second
ground?
or
does
your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
shouldn't
be
accepted
that
he
can
--
that
the
--
the
city
can
say
yes,
section
whatever
it
is,
said
is
out
because
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
who
cares
what
the
ground
is
so
long
as
it's
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
--
you
think
it
takes
--
gave
another
ground,
if
they
accepted
your
ground
and
it
would
--
the
confession
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
accepted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
the
invalidity
of
a
fee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
section
is
out.
if
the
section
is
out,
then
there's
no
fee,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
matter
what
they
say.
if
they
say
that
is
--
if
the
consequence
or
what
they
say
that
the
--
the
section
is
stricken,
then
they
--
because
they
gave
a
bad
reason,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
know
the
lawyers
like
to
have
their
own
grounds
for
favorable
decisions.
but
is
the
absence
of
giving
their
favorite
ground
an
unconstitutional
determination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
wasn't
there
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
story
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
wasn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
was
no
section
vi.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
that
question
would
not
be
here,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
then,
the
question
really
is
whether
an
acknowledgment
by
the
law
officer
not
passed
on
by
the
state
court
has
any
bearing
upon
that
particular
accusation
against
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
lot
of
words
are
there
but
the
question
is
whether
it's
legally
there.
