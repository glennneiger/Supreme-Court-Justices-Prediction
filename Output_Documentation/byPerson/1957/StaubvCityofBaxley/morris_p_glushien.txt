mr.
morris
p.
glushien
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
dramatic
example
of
a
southern
community,
frustrating
and
delaying
union
organization
for
nearly
four
years
under
the
guise
of
enforcing
a
patently
unconstitutional
ordinance.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
no.
this
is
the
--
i
--
there
was
a
--
accord
to
what
i'm
going
to
say
though,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
what
i
wanted
to
say
next
was
that
this
ordinance
is
represented
of
the
great
and
growing
number
of
such
ordinances
found,
so
far
as
i
researched
presently
discloses
throughout
the
south
and
not
the
north
which
is
why
i
made
a
point
i
did.
a
union
organizer
was
convicted
from
the
city
of
baxley,
georgia
under
a
licensing
ordinance
and
this
is
the
ultimate
appeal
from
the
conviction
which
has
been
sustained
through
the
georgia
courts.
in
february
1954,
two
organizers
of
the
international
ladies'
garment
workers
union
appeared
in
the
city
of
baxley.
they
had
been
sent
there
to
organize
or
try
to
organize
the
plant
of
the
hazelhurst
manufacturing
company
which
is
located
in
hazelhurst,
georgia,
a
town
which
neighbors
baxley.
the
hazelhurst
manufacturing
company
is
a
company
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
it
draws
its
workers
both
from
the
town
of
--
the
city
of
hazelhurst
and
also
from
the
city
of
baxley.
and
these
organizers
were
staying
at
a
motel
in
baxley
and
were
trying
to
solicit
among
others,
residents
of
the
city
of
baxley.
i
might
add
parenthetically
that
the
city
of
hazelhurst
has
an
ordinance
which
is
almost
verbatim,
a
copy
of
the
baxley
ordinance.
on
this
day,
on
february
15th,
1954,
when
they
first
came
there
on
a
monday,
they
approached
two
workers
at
the
home
of
one
of
them
on
the
porch
of
one
them,
the
workers,
told
them
that
they
were
trying
to
get
the
workers
of
the
hazelhurst
manufacturing
company
to
join
the
union
and
discussed
the
union
with
them,
arrange
or
survey
to
hold
a
--
another
meeting
on
friday,
that
written
on
the
case.
and
that
meeting
took
place
friday
at
noon
again
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
workers.
at
that
meeting
there
were
four
workers
present
together
with
the
two
organizers.
at
the
meeting,
the
organizers
discussed
with
them
the
advantages
of
joining
the
union,
urge
them
to
join,
told
them
about
the
membership
cards
that
they
had,
told
them
among
other
things
that
the
dues
were
64
cents
a
week,
and
a
discussion
went
on
concerning
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
joining
the
union.
nobody
joined
during
that
noon
meeting.
but
there
were
some
further
discussion
about
having
a
further
meeting
that
evening
at
which
additional
workers
would
be
present
to
be
held
at
7
o'clock
that
night.
but
before
that
meeting
could
be
held,
the
police
chief
of
baxley
arrested
these
two
organizers.and
they
were
charged
with
the
offense,
i'm
quoting.
“the
offense
of
soliciting
members
for
an
organization
without
a
permit
or
license.”
now,
the
ordinance
in
question
was
passed
in
1949
and
as
appears
from
the
original
question
and
answer
transcript,
mr.
highsmith,
the
city
solicitor,
my
learned
adversary,
stated
there
that
he
thinks
he
wrote
that
ordinance.
now,
the
ordinance
appears
on
pages
9
to
11
of
the
record
and
i
would
like
briefly
to
summarize
it.the
ordinance
is
a
9-section
ordinance,
starts
at
the
bottom
of
page
9.
and
essentially,
the
first
section
provides
that
before
any
person
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
mind
you,
a
person
who
was
paid
for
his
actions
or
who
receives
any
remuneration
of
any
kind.
any
person
who
solicits
membership
for
any
organization,
union
or
society
of
any
sort
which
requires
from
its
members
the
payments
of
membership
fees,
dues
or
is
entitled
to
make
assessments,
must
apply
to
the
mayor
and
to
the
city
council
for
a
permit
to
solicit
members.
section
ii
then
goes
on,
“to
set
forth
the
kind
of
information
that
must
be
provided
in
the
application
for
the
permit
among
other
things
that
requires
you
to
name
the
officers
of
the
organization,
and
whether
you
are
a
salaried
employee
of
the
organization.”
section
iii
goes
on
to
say
that,
“this
application
shall
be
submitted
to
a
meeting
of
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
and
provision
was
made
for
a
hearing.
and
section
iv
is
a
critical
section
indeed.”
i
like
to
read
it
to
you.
it
says
that,
“in
passing
upon
such
application,
the
mayor
and
council
shall
consider
the
character
of
the
applicant,
the
nature
of
the
business
of
the
organization
for
which
members
are
desired
to
be
solicited,
and
its
effects
upon
the
general
welfare
of
citizens
--
of
the
citizen
of
the
city
of
baxley.”
the
next
section
was
on
to
talk
about
the
grant
or
refusal
of
the
licence
on
how
--
how
that
is
to
be
determined.
and
then
section
vi
is
another
critical
section.
it
provides
that
in
the
event
that
person
is
a
salaried
employee
or
an
officer,
then
the
permit
shall
only
be
issued
upon
payment
of
a
slight
little
fee
of
$2000
per
year,
and
to
make
sure
that
it's
very
clear,
it
goes
on
to
say,
“also
$500
for
each
member
obtained.”
and
then,
the
remaining
sections
provide
that
penalties
for
non-compliance
of
the
ordinance
or
appeal
at
any
conflicting
ordinances
and
a
separability
clause.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
penalty
under
this
simply
says
that
it
would
be
the
same
as
provided
by
section
85
of
the
criminal
code,
and
i'm
sorry
to
say
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
that
is
except
that
the
particular
penalty
in
this
case
on
the
conviction
was
a
fine
of
$300
or
30
days
in
jail.
now,
this
ordinance,
this
arrest
took
place
and
the
trial
followed
in
the
mayor's
court
of
the
city
of
baxley.
in
the
mayor's
court,
the
two
organizers,
staub
and
merritt,
represented
by
a
competent
counsel
who
raised
in
detail
or
very
carefully,
the
same
federal
constitutional
questions
and
also
questions
under
the
state
constitution
which
we
hope
we
are
presenting
to
this
court.
he
did
show
that,
and
i
may
add
had
that
these
constitutional
questions
were
preserved
at
every
later
stage
of
the
appeals
through
the
georgia
courts.
they
were
convicted,
as
i
said,
and
fined
of
$300
or
30
days
on
each
of
the
two
organizers
to
receive
the
same
penalty.
and
parenthetically,
i
should
say
that
we
have
here
only
the
staub
appeal,
and
by
stipulation
of
counsel,
it
is
agreed
of
the
outcome
of
the
merritt
conviction
shall
await
the
--
and
be
handled
in
the
same
way
as
the
staub
case.
now,
in
an
effort
to
try
to
dispose
of
this
more
speedily,
the
union
instituted
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
superior
court
of
georgia.
i
think
immediately
after
the
arrest
as
i
recall,
the
superior
court
judge
dismissed
the
complaint
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
of
which
we
sought
to
restrain
the
holding
of
the
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
statute,
the
ordinance
was
unconstitutional.
and
we
took
an
appeal
from
that
dismissal
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
sustained
the
dismissal
of
the
declaratory
judgment
complaint.
and
thereupon,
the
mayor's
court
conviction
or
a
criminal
proceeding
as
i
should
say,
continued.
after
the
conviction
took
place,
we
took
an
appeal
to
the
next
layer
of
the
georgia
courts
which
is
the
superior
court.
i
want
to
tell
you
that
in
order
to
take
such
an
appeal,
you
have
to
file
a
bond.
and
immediately
after
the
conviction
on
--
in
march
1954,
the
very
same
afternoon
or
evening,
our
counsel
presented
that
fine
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
asked,
“are
you
the
clerk
of
the
mayor's
court?”
because
on
the
georgia
procedure,
if
she
was
the
clerk
of
the
mayor's
court,
then
she
had
it
countersigned
or
approved
the
bond.
if
there
wasn't
a
clerk,
the
mayor
himself
had
to
do
so.
being
assured
that
she
was
the
clerk
of
the
mayor's
court,
he
handed
her
the
bond
with
typewritten
words
on
it
saying
the
clerk
of
the
mayor's
court,
she
signed
it.
we
took
the
appeal
to
the
superior
court
and
after
a
while,
the
city
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
she
wasn't
really
the
clerk
of
the
mayor's
court.
she
was
only
the
clerk
of
the
city
council.
and
the
superior
court
threw
out
that
appeal
without
appeal.
well,
on
a
further
appeal
to
the
georgia
courts,
that
was
reversed
and
it
came
back
to
the
superior
court
with
instructions
to
hear
our
appeal
on
the
merits,
the
bond
was
sufficient.
there,
we
were
again
on
merits.
this
time
the
superior
court
denies
the
appeal
again,
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
questions
had
been
fully
presented,
it
will
--
no
opinion
at
all
denied
on
the
conviction.
we
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
next
mayor
and
the
georgia
structure.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
conviction
was
affirmed
again,
this
time
we
could
get
an
appeal.
but
the
court
didn't
pass
on
the
constitutionality
at
all
and
said
it's
unnecessary
to
do
so,
and
why?
well,
two
reasons,
the
court
assigned.
one,
that
if
staub
wanted
to
challenge
this
ordinance,
she
should
have
applied
for
a
permit
first.
and
having
failed
to
apply
to
affirm
it
under
the
ordinance,
she
had
no
standing
to
challenge.
this
ground
by
the
way,
is
one
which
had
been
ruled
out
specifically
by
this
very
court
in
lovell
against
griffin,
not
too
many
years
before,
also
at
georgia
case
and
which
was
presented
to
this
court
of
appeals
again
in
--
in
our
briefs
and
again
on
rehearing,
again
they
--
they
never
mentioned
lovell
against
griffin.
but
as
i
say,
held
that
we
had
no
standing
to
challenge
this
ordinance
because
we
haven't
applied
for
a
permit
under
it.
the
second
ground
they
assigned
was
that
we
had
challenged
the
ordinance
as
an
entirety
instead
of
specifying
which
of
these
nine
sections
we
thought
were
unconstitutional,
but
we
thought
all
of
them
unconstitutional.
the
ordinance
only
relates
to
one
subject
matter,
and
we
challenged
the
entire
ordinance.
and
as
we
make
clear
in
our
brief,
both
under
georgia
practice,
that
was
the
proper
procedure.
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
held
that.
and
a
state
court
cannot
deny
our
rights
to
challenge
an
ordinance
on
federal
grounds
by
preventing
us
from
attacking
an
entire
ordinance
when
in
fact
the
entire
ordinance
is
invalid.
anyway,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
our
application
for
hearing.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
denied
an
application
for
certiorari
without
any
opinion
and
we
then
came
to
this
court
which
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
now,
we
challenge
this
ordinance
on
a
number
of
grounds,
claiming
first
that
it
violates
our
rights
under
the
first
amendment
to
engage
in
associational
activities
to
speak
freely,
to
write
freely
to
assemble.
that
it
violates
our
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution,
that
it
violates
our
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
finally,
since
this
is
a
company
which
engages
an
interstate
commerce,
the
workers
of
which
in
hazelhurst
manufacturing
company.
that
factually
has
no
power
to
present
qualifications
on
the
right
of
the
organizers
to
urge
the
workers
of
this
company
engaged
in
commerce
to
join
a
union
of
their
choice.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
assume
so,
sir.
but
i
want
to
go
beyond
that
to
say
that
i
trust
that
this
statute
or
ordinance
would
be
considered
not
alone
on
section
vi
but
in
other
aspects
heard,
case
laws.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
agree
that
the
exorbitant
fees
in
itself
do
make
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
as
it's
conceded.
but
our
argument
goes
much
beyond
that
in
this
respect
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
--
even
on
that
section,
even
on
that
section.
what
i
want
to
argue
to
you
is
that
any
license
fees
of
any
size
as
a
predicate
for
organizing
is
unconstitutional.
now
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
i
say
to
you
that
the
--
the
entire
ordinance
is
before
you
because
she
was
convicted
not
for
violating
section
vi
but
for
violating
the
ordinance.
that
was
the
conviction,
and
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
this,
let
me
make
it
perfectly
plain.
there
are
a
whole
draft
of
such
ordinances
now
throughout
the
south
and
growing
in
number.
we
found
them
in
every
--
in
about
a
dozen
states
all,
and
more
being
enacted
everyday.
there
have
been
thus
far,
two
challenges
in
the
federal
courts,
two
such
ordinances.
one,
the
city
of
carrollton,
georgia
and
the
other,
in
russellville,
kentucky.
in
both
instances,
when
the
litigation
began
both
communities
hastened
to
amend
their
ordinances.
an
accounted
ordinance,
there
are
no
--
i
always
have
felt
that
carrollton
one
and
our
ordinance
were
competitors
for
the
--
for
the
price
i
was
speaking
which
were
the
most
exaggerated.
our
ordinance
had
a
$2000-annual
fee
and
with
--
plus
$500
for
each
member
obtained.
the
carrollton
ordinance
provided
for
$1000
down
payment
so
to
speak
with
a
$100
a
day.
well,
when
the
carrollton
litigation
been
all
the
while,
carrollton
changed
its
ordinance
to
--
to
knock
out
the
--
the
daily
fee
and
made
it
$1000
flat.
in
the
russellville
case,
the
kentucky
case,
the
ordinance
was
a
somewhat
more
restraining
one.
it
provided
for
a
fee,
flat
fee
of
only
$250
for
certain
categories
and
a
150%
in
other
categories.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
if
you're
going
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
your
honor,
if
you're
going
to
get
to
the
point
where
it's
a
pure
registration
statute
with
a
dollar
fee
merely
to
police
the
--
or
to
process
the
application,
i
think
we're
getting
to
a
somewhat
more
difficult
question.
but
if
you
say
it's
a
dollar
fee
for
the
right
to
organize
a
fee,
a
license
fee,
i
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional
under
your
decision
and
for
--
i
wanted
to
--
if
i
my
digress
from
my
argument.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
because
it's
a
flat
fee
on
a
first
amendment
guaranteed
right
for
a
further
reason.
that
if
this
is
an
operation
in
interstate
commerce.
then
i
think
any
flat
fee
on
the
right
to
organize
in
such
an
--
in
such
an
area
is
again
unconstitutional.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
if
it's
a
flat
fee,
my
position
is,
sir,
that
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
the
permit
and
the
fee
go
together.
to
get
a
fee
--
to
get
a
permit,
if
you
are
a
salaried
employee,
you
have
to,
in
addition,
pay
this
license
fee
of
$2000
plus
$500
for
each
member
obtained.
this
--
i
think
the
--
the
violation
here
was
the
contended
violation,
pardon
me,
sir.
now,
i
think
it
is
evident
under
the
decisions
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
association
and
press
and
assembly
have
been
infringed
by
an
ordinance
such
as
this
which
provides
that
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
from
denying
a
permit,
if
they
think
it
is
“not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
citizens,
uniting
the
general
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
baxley
that
the
permit
be
granted”
or
they
think
that
they
don't
like
the
“business
of
the
organization
for
which
members
have
desire
to
be
solicited”.
mind
you,
this
requirement
doesn't
apply
only
to
--
to
paid
organizers,
it
applies
to
any
person.
and
so
presumably,
one
worker
urging
another
worker
to
join
the
union
of
his
choice
would
also
be
covered
by
this
ordinance.
and
i
was
telling
my
little
daughter
at
breakfast
this
morning,
presumably,
if
she
urged
a
little
girl
to
join
the
girl
scouts
which
is
and
also
an
organization,
appears
that
--
which
charges
dues
of
about
$1
a
year,
that
too
would
be
a
violation
under
literal
terms
of
this
ordinance.
so,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
this
brought
an
absolute
discretion
under
the
many
decisions
of
this
court,
is
itself
enough
to
render
this
ordinance
unconstitutional.
now,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
the
city
concedes
that
the
prohibitory
character
of
the
large
fees
is
another
reason
why
this
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
but
our
position
as
i've
indicated,
is
that
any
of
my
license
taxes
bond
both
because
it
infringes
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
because
in
this
case
where
commerce
is
involved,
it
infringes
rights
which
the
city
has
no
power
to
regulate.
now
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
i
--
it's
conceivable,
i
suppose
that
a
--
that
if
--
if
the
licensing
provisions
did
not
require
any
fee
and
didn't
have
this
broad
discretionary
character,
i
assume
that
it
may
be
if
you're
getting
into
a
closer
area.
that
licensing
provisions
might
in
some
cases
be
valid,
although
i
got
to
point
out,
and
then
this
is
again
our
position,
basically
that
this
court
has
held
in
the
murdock
against
pennsylvania
case
and
in
the
opelika
case
and
others
that
you
cannot
require
a
license
fee
of
this
--
of
any
kind
of
a
religious
evangelist
(inaudible)
now,
i
would
think
you
may
have
a
closer
question
if
it's
a
purely
--
you're
talking
about
a
registration
statute
where
the
stranger
comes
into
the
community
and
the
police
authorities
want
to
know
who
he
is,
and
they're
not
going
to
delay
an
unduly
by
the
way
in
--
in
exercising
his
rights
so
that
there's
not
a
disguised
denial
of
privileged
rights
in
the
first
amendment.
perhaps,
you
may
have
a
closer
contention
then.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
yes.
although,
i
suppose
this
court
could
very
well
say
that
on
both
theory
come
out
both
grounds
and
each
separately
--
separately,
this
ordinance.
it
is
now
and
the
conviction
therefore
should
not
stand.
i'd
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
these
ordinances
in
many
states
which
are
recounted
in
our
brief
on
page
31
in
note
20
and
i
don't
think
they
begin
to
cover
the
number
and
extent
of
these
ordinances.
we
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
hold
of
them.
the
--
we
write
to
the
clerks
and
one
clerk
writes
back
to
me
as
we
are
about
to
repeal
the
ordinance,
i
don't
think
they're
really
interested
in
it.
and
other
counsel
tell
me
who
--
who
been
trying
to
get
all
copies
of
these
ordinances
for
me
that
the
clerks
resist
very
strenuously
making
them
available.
and
so
i
think
this
is
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
actual
ordinances
in
existence
but
i
have
done
though,
and
since
the
brief
has
been
written,
we
have
gathered
together
a
--
a
number
of
additional
ordinances
of
somewhat
similar
character.
and
if
i
may
have
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
at
the
end
of
the
argument
to
add
that
to
-
as
a
supplement
to
this
footnote
which
list
the
various
ordinances.
we
have
already
given
mr.
highsmith
a
copy
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
now,
i
want
to
point
out
one
other
thing
about
the
ordinances
even
if
that
these
were
much
lower
than
they
are.
and
this
court
had
--
has
recognized
this
in
its
discussions
of
the
religious
evangelist
cases.
even
they
have
a
small
fee
or
a
relatively
small
fee,
the
cumulative
effect
of
such
ordinances
adds
up
to
a
increasingly
large
burden.
and
as
these
ordinances
become
increasingly
fashionable,
the
--
the
real
burden
is
meant
to
apply
that
much.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
hazelhurst
ordinance
provided
for
a
$5000
fee.
so
the
organizer
workers
of
these
two
--
living
in
this
two
cities,
you
would
have,
theoretically
if
a
$5000
to
hazelhurst,
$2000
for
baxley,
$500
for
each
person
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
--obtained.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
so,
i
--
i
will
just
spend
a
few
moments
then
to
say
that
we
also
think
that
quite
apart
from
the
considerations
i
have
already
covered
that
this
ordinance
is
also
invalid
apart
from
the
tax
itself
as
conflicting
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
insofar
as
it
requires
the
licensing
of
--
of
any
organizers.
we
think
that
the
--
under
the
decision
in
hill
against
florida,
this
court
has
held
that
the
licensing
of
organizers
who
organize
in
interstate
commerce
industries
is
itself
unconstitutional.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
may
it
please
the
court.
so
that
our
position
will
be
extremely
clear,
and
i
must
only
get
assure
that
i
made
it
quite
there
yesterday
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question.
i
want
to
say
that
as
we
view
it,
this
ordinance
is
independently
invalid
on
two
basic
grounds
under
the
first
amendment,
the
first
being
that
it
leaves
to
the
city
authorities
the
power
to
grant
or
deny
licenses
on
discretionary
ground.
and
we
say
that
the
first
amendment
forbids
that
kind
of
a
requirement
where
elementary
rights
of
speech
and
association
are
concerned.
the
second,
an
independent
ground
for
our
attack
under
the
first
amendment,
is
that
the
imposition
of
any
flat
license
tax
is
invalid
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
murdock
case
and
the
opelika
case
and
follett
against
mccormick
and
others.
so
that,
these
are
our
two
basic
premises.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
city
here
confesses
that
the
tax
is
bad
because
it
is
prohibitory.
but
the
fact
the
city
confesses
invalidity
on
a
particular
ground,
i
submit,
does
not
relieve
this
court
of
its
independent
obligation
to
determine
for
itself
the
grounds
of
invalidity.
the
confessor
cannot
choose
the
ground.
now,
the
fact
is
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
the
confession
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
as
prohibitory.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
they
say
it's
unconstitutional
because
it
is
prohibitory
in
character.
that
it
is
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
the
point
i
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
i
think
the
confession
must
be
accepted
by
the
court
but
i
don't
think
that
that
constricts
the
grounds
upon
which
this
court
was
passed
on
the
invalidity
of
a
fee.
for
instance,
it's
the
mere
fact
that
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
of
a
fee
charge,
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
that
is
true.
but
if
they
say
it's
out
because
and
only
because
the
amount
is
too
large,
i
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
no,
sir,
but
it
--
of
course,
it's
stricken
on
that
ground
too.
it
is
a
good
reason,
but
there
is
an
independently
better
reason,
namely,
that
the
section
is
also
invalid
because
it
imposes
any
fees.
and
i
say
these
are
two
different
buttresses
to
the
--
or
you
take
away
two
different
buttresses
to
the
invalidity
or
to
the
validity
of
the
section.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
of
course
not.
it
should
also
be
noted
the
section
is
still
there
and
hasn't
been
repealed.
it
still
stands
there
to
any
person
who
would
today
seek
a
license
in
baxley,
georgia.
and
if
we
don't
--
if
this
court
should
not
hold
that
it
is
invalid
for
the
independent
reason
that
it
charges
any
fee
as
a
constriction
on
first
amendment
grounds,
i
think
we're
in
for
a
long
period
of
litigation.
is
$2500
correct?
is
$1000
correct?
is
$100
correct?
if
the
city
were
to
merely
change
the
amount
of
the
fee
and
reenact
the
ordinance
of
that
form,
i
say
that
we
will
come
back
with
a
whole
generation
of
litigation
over
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
such
license
fees
for
the
use
of
elementary
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
and
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
it
would
be
invalid
because
it
provides
with
discretionary
licensing
effect.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
true.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
correct.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
suppose
there
were
no
free
charge,
sir?
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
say
this
ordinance
is
still
valid.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
correct.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
all
i
can
tell
you,
sir,
is
that
the
--
the
section
is
still
on
the
books
of
baxley
to
this
day.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
the
fact
is
for
eight
years,
they
didn't
repeal
it
although
--
and
in
the
georgia
courts,
i
may
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
was
no
forthright
confession
that
section
vi
was
invalid.
the
argument
was
rather
made
that
the
court
shouldn't
pacify
it.
that
was
the
basic
argument
of
this
as
submitted.
if
i
may
go
up
another
few
moments,
i
also
want
to
say
that
this
section,
this
ordinance
rather,
quite
a
popular
first
amendment
grounds,
violates
the
--
and
conflicts
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
imposing
any
license
fee
because,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
did
observe
in
response
to
counsel's
statements
before,
hale
against
florida
holds,
as
we
read
it
quite
clearly,
that
the
attachment
of
any
licensing
requirements
to
--
where
congress
did
not
impose
any
conflicts
with
the
requirements
in
the
prohibition
set
forth
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
there
are
other
reasons
why
it
conflicts
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
we
set
forth
in
our
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
