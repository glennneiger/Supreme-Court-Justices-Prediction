mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
plead
guilty
from
being
from
a
southern
city
and
also,
i
would
like
to
say
with
reference
to
counsel's
having
said
that
i
admitted
arriving
to
the
ordinance.
i
--
as
i
recall,
perhaps
i
did
with
the
exception
as
it
appears
on
the
original
and
the
minutes
of
the
city
of
baxley,
the
amounts
of
the
license
fee
were
left
blank.
i
do
not
attend
those
counsel
meetings.
and
my
first
information
of
the
amounts
that
when
this
case
was
brought
to
my
attention,
i
then
advised
the
city
that
--
and
they
--
they
could
not
asses
that
sort
of
license
fee,
that
it
would
be
unreasonable.
and
since
then,
we
have
taken
the
city
--
taken
the
position
that
they
could
not
impose
that
sort
of
license
fee
as
it
would
be
unreasonable.
and
we
--
i
have
no
brief
for
determining
the
validity
of
that
particular
section
vi
of
the
act.
of
course,
the
first
question
that
arises
in
this
case
is
the
adequacy
or
non-adequacy
of
the
federal
question
involved.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
it
provides
for
a
fine,
not
in
excess
of
$300
or
not
in
--
time
and
not
in
excess
that's
for
30
days
i
think
and
that's
what
it
tells
about.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
yes,
sir,
$300.
yes,
sir.
i
realized
it
was
going
to
be
quite
a
long
contest
about
it.[laughs]
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
but
--
but
--
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
it
said
or,
30
days
or
--
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
no,
that
was
a
30
day
or
--
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
or
the
$300,
either
one
would
take
care
of
the
payments.
as
i
said,
i
--
i
want
to
discuss
briefly
the
--
whether
we
have
actually
a
decision
here
by
the
state
court
on
the
--
on
a
federal
question
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
ordinance.
it's
true
that
there
has
been
extended
litigation
upon.
it
was
the
--
have
been
--
the
criminal
litigation
was
pending
in
the
mayor's
court.
counsel
for
the
appellants
brought
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
raised
the
point
on
the
merit,
two
points.
one,
that
when
the
criminal
action
was
pending
and
that
you
could
raise
that
question
in
that
criminal
action,
that
then
the
court's
practice
was
not
to
issue
a
restraining
order
and
restrain
the
criminal
action.
otherwise,
since
the
plea
(inaudible)
attacked
the
ordinance
as
a
whole
and
didn't
point
out
any
particular
sections
of
it
as
being
invalid
that
therefore,
it
was
not
a
proper
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
action
under
georgia
procedure.
the
superior
court
does
not
in
georgia.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
right
in
the
opinion
to
say
as
of
--
just
say
we
sustained
the
demurrer
or
you
refuse
a
certiorari
and
don't
write
--
written
--
don't
give
written
opinion
except
in
vey
exceptional
cases.
our
judge
never
do
it.
he
did
--
he
did
sustain
the
demurrer
to
the
declaratory
action
and
that
was
held
proper
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
saying
that
this
was
a
question
they
could
raise
and
the
criminal's
action,
it
was
pending
in
the
city
court
and
it
was
not
a
matter
for
equity
to
pass
on.
and
that
was
the
decision
there.
they
do
have
--
they
came
back
and
it
was
pried
then
in
the
city
court.
now,
i
want
--
and
on
the
question
and
while
we're
on
the
question
of
the
trial,
it
is
i
think
important
in
this
case
for
it
to
be
brought
out
that
this
case
goes
further
than
the
case
--
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
to
thomas
versus
collins.
on
the
trial,
it
appeared
from
two
of
the
workers
that
were
present,
had
testified
on
the
trial
before
the
mayor's
court
that
the
organizers
in
this
case
solicited
money
from
them,
that
they
told
them
their
dues
were
64
cents
a
week
and
that
if
they
would
pay
two
weeks
in
advance,
that
they
would
write,
then
issue
them
a
membership
card.
in
other
words,
they
were
selling
membership
to
this
particular
time.
we
distinguished
it
from
thomas
versus
collins.
and
after
--
on
that
appeal
in
mayor's
court,
some
reflection
has
been
made
or
that
the
courts,
were
just
trying
to
sustain
some
technicalities.
they
do
have
the
rule
and
a
lot
of
technical
rules
with
reference
to
certiorari,
i
think
in
most
every
court.
they
have
the
rule
that
if
the
mayor's
court
does
not
have
a
clerk,
then
the
mayor
approves
a
bond.
now,
the
clerk
was
not
asked,
was
she
a
clerk.
of
course,
mr.
glushien
wasn't
there
and
he
couldn't
be
--
he
doesn't
make
an
intention
anywhere
about
that.
the
party
there
was
asked.
my
friend,
leanne
wilson
asked
me,
“does
the
city
have
a
clerk?”
or
that's
what
i
understood
him
to
say.
“does
the
city
have
a
clerk?”
and
i
said,
“yes,
the
city
has
a
clerk,
ms.
(inaudible).”
later,
she
--
she
was
put
on
the
stand
and
he
asked
you
the
question,
“what
is
your
idea?
what
are
your
--
what
is
your
official
position
with
the
city?”
and
she
said,
“clerk
of
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
baxley.
that
was
her
answer
at
that
time.
and
if
any
misrepresentation
was
made,
it
wasn't
the
clerk
of
the
city
of
baxley.
it
was
--
if
the
city
attorney
could
speak,
then
it
--
it
was
certainly
not
a
misrepresentation.
there
was
an
issue
as
to
whether
he
said,
“does
the
mayor's
court
have
a
clerk
and
do
the
city
have
a
clerk?”
my
recollection
in
the
statement
was
that
he
said,
“does
the
city
have
a
clerk?”
didn't
--
isn't
important
in
this
case
except
to
show
there
wasn't
any
just
trying
to
get
these
people
put
out
of
court
on
technicality.
we
did
take
the
position
and
he
said,
“well,
she
signed
it
as
clerk
of
the
city
court.”
i
might
well
say
we
--
that
he
went
somewhat
out
of
the
record
at
the
same
time
and
it
doesn't
--
important
to
me
as
she
signed
it.
at
the
same
time,
the
mayor
signed
an
approval
of
the
bond
over
a
typewritten
signature
of
the
clerk
of
the
city
court.
i
guess
if
you
do
those
things
without
notice
and
they
per
se
sign
them,
they
sign
them
without
too
much
notice.
i
said
i
didn't
object
to
them
being
signed.
and
i
made
that
point
that
there
wasn't
a
proper
bond
and
the
superior
court
sustained
it.
the
clerk
--
the
court
of
appeals
sent
a
--
that
mr.
wilson
could
have
been
misled
and
that
they
didn't
want
it
passed
on,
on
that
ground
but
wanted
to
hear
it,
have
it
heard
on
its
merits
and
send
it
back.
again,
we
--
we
raised
the
same
question
that
they
hadn't,
under
georgia
procedure,
properly
attacked
here
the
constitutionality
of
the
order
because
the
rule
in
georgia
is
that
one
section
might
be
constitutional
and
another
section
not
constitutional.
and
therefore,
if
you're
on
a
race,
the
--
the
question
of
the
invalidity
of
an
ordinance,
you
have
to
point
out
those
particular
sections.
now,
that
may
sound
or
may
not
sound
like
an
unreasonable
rule.
but
that
is
a
practice
that
the
appellate
courts
have
followed
there.
the
first
important
case,
i
recall
about
it,
was
glover
versus
rome
back
in
1931.
that
same
specific
thing
was
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
the
next
case
was
in
1945,
anthony
versus
the
city
of
atlanta,
they
held
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
those
cases
were
pointed
out
to
--
by
a
counsel
or
two
counsels
for
appellant
on
this
arguments
that
we
had.
we
had
this
specific
volume
to
the
georgia's
report
there.
they
knew
about
it
but
they
--
they
persisted
in
going
along
the
way
that
they
have
gone
and
the
court
of
appeal
sustained
and
the
superior
court
judge
said
that
that
was
good,
that
they
hadn't
property
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
it
and
decided
it
that,
the
certiorari.
when
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
made
the
same
argument
and
the
court
of
appeals,
as
is
the
rule
that
they
won't
go
into
a
constitutionality
of
a
--
of
a
question
if
they
can
decide
it
without
by
--
without
deciding
on
the
constitutionality
as
always.
i
believe
that
same
rule
prevails
almost
universally
in
this
court
too,
i
believe.
and
they
held
that
there
has
not
been,
under
georgia
practice,
a
proper
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
ordinance
and
specifically
did
not
pass
on
that
question.
we
take
the
position
and
very
strongly
that
the
court
did
decide
it
on
an
adequate
non-federal
ground
and
that
this
court
could
very
properly
hold
that
the
court
did
do
that.
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
rule
of
this
court
is
that
unless
there
is
a
question
of
evasion
by
the
state
court,
that
what
the
practice
--
the
rules
of
practice
are
in
a
particular
state,
what
that
--
that
state
court
says
they
are
will
be
followed
but
this
court.
now,
of
course,
if
this
court
should
decide
that
before
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
were
as
furiously
as
a
--
say
in
their
brief,
evading
the
issue
and
there
was
an
evasion,
then
of
course
say
it
could
this
question
on
its
merits.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
i
--
i've
made
a
concession
that
i
wouldn't
argue
that,
that
it
was
not.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
that
it
was
valid.
in
our
brief
because
i
took
the
position
that
i
wouldn't
contend
it's
the
same.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
i
might
argue
it
on
the
question
on
the
demurrer
and
on
the
merits.
yes,
sir.
i
did
both.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
discussed
briefly
yesterday
afternoon
the
jurisdictional
question
involved
in
this
case.
i'd
move
on
now
to
the
other
features
of
the
case.
under
the
facts
of
this
case
as
they
are
in
the
record
we
think
in
fact
with
respect
to
the
ordinance
that
actually
only
the
two
first
sections
are
involved
because
the
appellant
made
no
application
for
a
license
and
that
is
really
the
only
two
sections
that
have
been
applied
to
appellant.
it's
somewhat
similar
or
it's
an
ordinance
consisting
of
nine
separate
sections.
it
specifically
provides
that
the
invalidity
of
anyone
of
those
sections
will
not
invalidate
the
ordinance.
now,
it
is
somewhat
similar,
to
my
mind,
as
was
the
matter
in
the
case
of
harriss
involving
the
federal
regulation
of
lobbying
act.
it
will
be
recalled
that
in
that
case,
the
appellant
made
the
contention
that
the
provision
of
that
act
that
said
that
anyone
convicted
of
the
act
of
a
violation
of
the
act
could
not
petition
the
government
or
could
not
engage
in
lobbying
for
a
period
of
three
years.
the
court
held
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
pass
on
that
feature
of
it
that
that
section
hadn't
been
attempted
to
be
applied
and
therefore,
it
wasn't
before
the
court
and
it
would
be
taken
up
in
such
time
as
it
did
become
before
the
court.
and
the
same
situation
exists
here
because
these
two
sections
say
that
before
soliciting
a
person
for
a
membership
in
a
society
that
requires
the
payments
of
dues,
it
involved
the
money
matter
that
they
shall
make
the
application.
actually,
that
section
does
not
require
a
permit
as
their
writ.
it
says
that
they
shall
have
to
make
the
application
first.
a
subsequent
section
does
say,
of
course,
that
they
don't
obtain
the
permit.
well,
then,
they
could
be
prosecuted
under
the
criminal
section.
this,
to
my
mind,
is
the
issue
that
has
been
so
recently
before
this
court
that
it
doesn't
need
to
be
dwelled
on
at
any
great
length.
it
is
strictly
within
the
ruling
of
the
court
under
the
case,
the
thomas
case,
where
a
similar
registration
was
required.
and
the
court,
of
course,
in
that
decision,
restricted
itself
to
the
fact
that
the
injunction
granted
did
prohibit
the
union
from
having
the
right
of
free
bargaining
because
that
--
no,
i'm
mistaken
to
hear
the
case,
did
prevent
freedom
of
speech
because
the
man
could
not
make
a
speech.
and
it
held
here
and
we
do
rely
strictly
on
this
part
of
the
decision,
it
said
once
a
speaker
goes
further
high
up
and
engages
in
conduct
which
amount
to
more
than
the
right
of
free
discussion
comprehends
as
when
he
undertakes
collections
of
funds
or
securing
subscriptions,
he
enters
the
realm
when
reasonable
restriction
or
identification
requirements
may
be
imposed.
now,
that
is
what
we
contend
here.
that
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
this
was
a
paid
organized
pursuing
their
vocation
of
an
organizer
and
soliciting
money,
not
just
talking
about
the
rights
of
labor
or
the
benefits
of
labor
but
soliciting
money.
and
under
that
direct
ruling
in
the
thomas
case,
we
say
--
say
that
this
matter
should
be
held
valid.
now,
appellant
has
said
it
would
be
an
undue
hardship
on
labor
to
be
required
to
meet
what
might
be
various
regulations
in
various
municipalities.
well,
i
think
we
are
exposed
to
the
same
thing
in
any
profession
or
vocation.
as
a
lawyer,
if
i
practice
in
different
states,
i
have
to
get
a
license
in
each
state.
and
if
i
practice
before
different
courts,
i
have
to
get
a
license
from
each
court.
and
that
hasn't
proved
any
undue
hardship
as
far
as
the
bar
is
concerned.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
respect
to
medicine.
they
have
to
comply
with
the
regulations
of
the
state.
that
regulates
their
vocation.
now,
if
this
is
a
restraint
upon
the
freedom
of
speech,
if
it
comes
within
that
domain,
then
all
of
appellant's
contentions
are
applicable
because
it
would
be
a
previous
restraint.
it
would
be
an
invalid
restraint
if
it
is
within
that
domain.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
i
don't
believe
that
there
had
been
any
members
of
the
bar
[laughs]
since
i
--
this
has
come
up
within
my
knowledge
that
there
had
been
--
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
--
there
haven't
been
and
there
haven't
been
any
numbers
of
bar.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
yes,
sir.
there
could
be.
i'm
saying
--
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
yes,
sir.
it's
a
matter
that
--
it's
a
matter
the
bar
can't
assess
dues
or
they
do
have
dues
and
it
involves
money
and
so
under
property
rights
that
the
court
says
that
the
regulations
can
protect.
well,
they
think
they
--
they
could.
yes.
i
would
say
that
that
they
could.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
i
have.
yes.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
no,
sir.
i
--
i
would
say
this
with
respect
to
that
question
that
it
has
been
frequently
held
that
this
court
will
not
--
nor
any
other
court,
will
not
presume
that
an
invalid
section
of
an
ordinance
will
be
enforced.
if
it
was
invalid
and
if
it
--
i
agree
that
it
is
invalid,
then
the
court
would
suppose
that
the
officer
would
not
enforce
an
invalid
section.
and
so
therefore,
he
would
not
have
had
to
pay
a
license
had
he
made
any
application
because
the
presumption
is
that
that
would
not
have
been
enforced.
and
--
and
that
applies
to
the
whole
reasoning
of
the
same.
if
they
can
pick
out
some
separate
section
and
say,
“well,
that
particular
section
is
invalid,”
but
if
those
first
two
sections
are
valid,
and
i
see
no
reason
under
the
ruling
of
the
thomas
case
why
they
aren't
and
also
the
hale
case
well,
then,
they
are
not
right
in
their
contentions
here
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
section
6?
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
no,
sir.
it
hasn't
ruled
on
the
validity
of
any.
of
course,
that
was
the
point
i
made
yesterday
afternoon
that
it
hasn't
held
any
section
to
be
either
valid
or
invalid.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
it
--
this
is
the
only
application
i
know.
it's
the
only
time
within
my
knowledge
that
matters
come
up
there
so
far
as
the
question
of
soliciting
members.
the
--
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
yes.
do
you
mean
the
--
the
ordinance?
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
it
hasn't
--
hasn't
been
up
before.
this
is
the
only
time
it
has
come
up.
it's
been
passed
1949.
there
have
been
--
there
may
have
been
organizations
that
require
the
payments
of
use
organized.
i
have
no
often
knowledge
of
one
in
my
own
on
that.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
those
--
those
that
could
require
the
payment
of
use,
i
think,
it
would
be
applicable.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
as
far
as
i
know,
i
know
it
has
not
been
applied.
i
would
know
of
it
if
it
had
and
it
has
not.
it's
--
it
has
not
been
applied
in
that
--
in
that
connection.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
that
is
not
in
this
record.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
it
is
not
in
this
record.
it
hasn't
been
raised.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
not
to
my
mind,
sir.
a
penal
provision
of
an
ordinance
is
never
necessarily
a
vital
part.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
section
vi
imposed
a
license.
i
would
say
--
i
was
mistaken
in
thinking
of
the
section.
i
would
say
it
was
not
a
vital
section
because
a
regulation
as
it's
been
pointed
out
by
this
court,
a
regulation
that
requires
information
as
to
the
character
of
the
person
or
the
nature
of
the
organization,
information
to
protect
citizens
that
--
that
it
can
be
imposed.
we
--
you
had
the
same
thing
in
--
as
again
if
i
can
refer
to
it,
in
the
federal
trade
--
federal
regulation
of
the
lobbying
act.
there,
they
didn't
enforce
that
particular
penal
section.
they
said
it
was
separable.
and
this
court
pointed
out
that
in
--
in
that
case,
there
were
great
many
pressures
on
congress
to
pass
legislation
or
defeat
legislation.
and
that
this
court
wouldn't
try
to
protect
them
against
that
but
that
congress
had
the
right
to
know
from
where
is
that
pressure
came.
and
that
we
take
the
same
position
here
that
now,
in
our
present
time,
many
activities
or
more
or
to
a
great
extent,
all
of
our
activities,
all
or
though
organizations,
they
have
professions
of
--
made
of
organizers.
it's
trained
people
to
--
in
--
get
people
to
join
those
organizations.
now,
we
can't
prevent
and
wouldn't
attempt
to
prevent.
it
wouldn't
be
valid
to
sail
of
the
idea
of
organization.
but
i
do
say
that
as
members
of
congress
have
the
right
to
know
from
where
those
pressures
came,
that
members
of
the
public
have
the
right
to
know
what
organization
they
have
--
being
sought
to
get
as
members,
the
nature
of
that
organization
and
the
nature
of
the
person
that
is
seeking
to
get
them
in
to
the
organization.
that
is
i
see
it
is
the
whole
crux
of
this
matter
as
to
whether
of
one
that
pursue
the
vocation
of
organizer
can
be
subject
to
regulation.
now,
the
only
--
they
do
raise
the
question
of
section
vii
and
say
that
this
--
the
labor
act
is
in
conflict
with
it.
in
the
collins
case
again,
it
was
held
regulations
of
this
sort
didn't
necessarily
conflict
with
the
labor
act
and
also
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
hale
versus
florida
that
it
was
not
a
necessary
requirement
of
registration
or
information.
it
was
not
necessarily
in
conflict
with
the
wagner
act
and
if
it
was
not,
then
it
wasn't
invalid
for
that
reason.
mr.
j.
h.
highsmith
they
said
"if
it
would".
i
have
the
wording
here
[laughs].
in
the
--
they
said
“as
applied”
in
that
instance
that
--
that
it
was
in
conflict
but
they
said
if
it
was
just
merely
a
measure
of
requiring
information
and
whatnot,
then
it
wouldn't
be
in
conflict.
but
there,
the
union
was
enjoined
from
acting
any
--
any
respect
as
a
union
and
of
course,
that
prevented
the
free
bargain.
