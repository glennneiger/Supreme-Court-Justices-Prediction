you
may
do
that
and
the
counsel
may

may
respond
to
it
if
he
wishes.

staub,

mr.
highsmith,
you
may
proceed.
chief

do
you
require
--
do
you
require
them
to
get
a
permit
to
solicit
members
of

chief

there
hadn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
suppose
there
would
be
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly,
it
would
be
under,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
highsmith,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
things
that
bothered
me
was
you
--
you
say
that
he
can't
attack
the
constitutionality
of
any
section
except
the
first
two
because,
because
he
didn't
apply
for
such
a
license.
but
now,
as
a
part
of
his
applying
for
the
license,
if
he
has
to
get
it,
he
must
pay
$2000.
now,
you
have
admitted
the
unconstitutionality
of
that
--
of
that
part
of
the
section.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
still
you
would
--
you
would
hold
him,
would
you
not,
to
--
to
offer
him
to
pay
that
$2000
before
he
could
get
a
license.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
your
supreme
court
hold
that
that
section
was
invalid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
--
yes.
