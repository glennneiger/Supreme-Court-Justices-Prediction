mr.
stanley
hornsby
may
it
please
the
court.
the
international
life
insurance
company
is
a
legal
reserve
life
insurance
company
from
texas.
it
did
not
do
a
mail
order
business
in
california
nor
it
doesn't
do
a
mail
order
business
in
any
other
state.
the
matter
in
which
we
happened
to
require
this
california
policyholder
was
that
we
had
a
reinsurance
agreement
which
was
entered
into
with
an
arizona
corporation
where
the
international
is
also
authorized
to
do
business.
and
in
connection
with
that
reinsurance
agreement,
the
arizona
corporation
was
what
ours
on
the
calls
a
benefit
corporation
which
is
a
mutual
assessment
association.
and
in
that
connection,
the
agreement
provided
that
international
was
to
offer
to
all
policyholders
of
empire
mutual,
a
policy
with
the
legal
reserved
company,
international,
are
that
the
policyholder
should
have
the
right
to
withdraw
his
proportionate
share
under
(inaudible).
in
compliance
with
that
agreement
made
with
the
arizona
corporation,
international
carried
out
its
part
and
mailed
to
the
policyholder
in
california,
its
reinsurance
certificate
which
he
accept.
thereafter,
the
only
thing
done
by
international
was
to
mail
the
usual
and
customary
premium
notices
and
thereafter,
deny
liability
by
mail.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that
is
correct,
sir.
it
was
not.
not
only
was
this
policyholder
not
solicited
but
we
have
solicited
no
other
policy
over
this.
in
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
the
record
shows
that
it
was
mailed
to
him
by
the
empire
mutual
from
arizona.
now,
the
record
stipulation
does
not
show
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
have
no
idea,
sir.
that
was
before
we
came
into
the
picture.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
no,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
it
says
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
--
that
it
was
mailed
--
the
stipulation
provides,
it
was
mailed
to
him
from
the
office
of
the
empire
in
arizona.
it
does
not
say
where
he
was
at
the
time.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
both,
mr.
justice,
from
the
standpoint
that
the
statute
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
to
our
client.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
well,
our
company
did
mail
a
reinsurance
certificate.
yes.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that's
right,
sir.
prior
to
the
time
--
prior
to
the
time
that
this
statute
was
adopted.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
think
it
possibly
would
be
so
construed,
sir.
gentlemen,
i
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
sir?
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that,
i
think,
is
correct,
sir.
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
sir?
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes,
sir.
the
premiums
have
--
in
other
words,
the
customary
premium
notices
were
sent
to
him.
the
premiums
were
mailed
to
the
company
in
texas.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
but,
justice,
i
think
that's
one
question.
i
think
there's
a
further
question
which
is
the
holding
of
the
(inaudible)
cases
that
even
the
california
statute,
assuming
that
it
is
constitutional
--
even
assuming
that
it
is
constitutional
in
its
application
under
these
facts
that
it
would
not
be
applicable
to
this
policy
which
was
issued
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
statute.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
if
i
understand
you,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
our
position
is
that
this
respondent
did
not
have
sufficient
contacts
with
california
to
warrant
under
the
due
process
clause,
the
application
of
this
statute
to
him.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
intend
to
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
sir?
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that
will
be
the
second
part.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
this
court
has
written
in
several
instances,
probably
the
case
which
has
become
the
one
that's
more
frequently
referred
to
now
as
the
more
enlightened
rational
is
that
of
the
international
shoe
company
case.
we
would
like
to
particular
remind
you
that
in
that
case,
of
course,
there
were
some
13
--
11
to
13
resident
salesmen
who
lived
in
the
state.
their
commissions
were
large.
a
tremendous
amount
of
business
was
obtained
there.
and
this
court
held
in
construing
that
situation
that
due
process
was
not
violated,
and
that
the
contacts
of
the
state
were
not
irregular
or
casual,
that
they
were
systematic
and
continuous
throughout
the
years
and
that
those
minimum
contacts
did
not
offend
your
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
or
substantial
justice.
of
course,
in
this
case,
we
think
an
entirely
different
situation
prevails.
we
have
never
had
any
sales
personnel.
we
have
never
had
any
agents
in
california,
and
we
don't
believe
that
this
case
meets
the
minimum
test
set
down
in
the
international
shoe
company
case.
after
the
international
shoe
company
case,
of
course,
you
have
the
travelers
versus
virginia.
and
again,
in
that
case,
you
had
a
general
mail
order
business
being
done
by
the
travelers
health
association
in
which
they
have
some
800
members
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
they
had
solicited
those
members,
not
only
about
mail
but
also
by
those
who
are
already
members
in
the
state.
in
addition
to
that,
they
have
caused
many
sick
benefit
claims
to
be
investigated
within
the
state.
you
will
recall,
of
course,
that
you
applied
in
the
one
opinion,
the
osborn
efforts
and
then
international
shoe
principles
and
held
that
the
transactions
were
not
merely
isolated
or
short-lived.
and
that
the
certificates
were
systematically
and
widely
delivered
following
solicitations
based
on
recommendations
of
virginians
and
that
there
were
many
certificate
holders
in
the
state.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
surely,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
set
out
separately,
mr.
justice,
in
connection
with
our
brief.
but
if
you
will
permit
me
to
digress
just
a
moment
there,
i
would
like
to
urge
to
this
court
that
it
is
probably
pretty
high
time
that
we
become
a
little
bit
concern
about
the
policyholders
who
are
not
litigated.
as
is
evidenced
by
this
case,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
what
the
circumstances
were
we
sought
to
show
them
in
the
trial
court,
we
offer
the
claimant's
statement,
the
colonel's
report,
the
colonel's
verdict
and
the
transcript
to
the
testimony
taken.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
in
california,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that's
correct,
sir.
and
it
showed
that
the
man
had
committed
suicide
which
was
not
one
of
the
things
covered
by
the
policy.
it
was
expressly
excluded
from
the
policy.
the
point
i
wanted
to
make,
mr.
justice,
was
this.
that
we
hear
courts
talking
about
the
--
protecting
the
litigants,
the
people
who
have
to
sue
insurance
companies.
maybe
years
ago,
the
insurance
business
was
somewhat
different
from
what
it
is
today,
but
my
experience
with
the
insurance
business
today
is
that
you
don't
have
very
much
trouble
with
companies
who
deny
claims
on
invalid
grounds.
where
the
difficulty
arises
is
where
the
claims
are
made
without
adequate
grounds.
in
other
words,
these
policyholders
who
don't
litigate
are
having
to
pay
premiums
now
considerably
greater
than
they
would
have
to
be
if
all
your
invalid
claims
weren't
paid.
now,
we
have
situations
that
exist
generally.
and
i
--
i
think
the
court
realizes
it.
mention
has
been
made
of
the
claims
being
too
small
for
the
policyholder
to
take
them
to
the
home
state
of
company
to
litigate
them.
in
times,
there
are
many
instances
even
within
the
state
of
texas
where
our
claims
on
held
that
accident
policies
maybe
too
small
to
warrant
our
litigating
them.
your
modern
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that's
all
right,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
think
the
thing
that
would
have
been
wrong,
sir,
is
that
it
would
have
put
the
company
to
the
expense
of
defending
an
invalid
claim
in
california.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
and
my
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
mr.
justice,
the
evidence
that
we
referred
to
were
the
claimants
statement
the
certificate
of
death,
the
colonel's
verdict
and
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
the
colonel's
report
are
written
documentary
evidence.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
would
--
i
would
say,
sir,
that,
of
course,
if
we
were
in
the
situation
that
we
had
done
anything
to
get
us
in
to
california
but
probably,
there
is
our
--
to
suggest
might
be
necessary.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes,
sir,
we
collected
one
dollar
a
month.
collected
in
--
in
its
entirely,
$30,
i
believe.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
$5000.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
don't
know
what
they
alleged,
sir.
as
i
say,
they
just
said
that
the
policy
had
been
issued
when
the
man
died.
i'm
sure
they
did
not
make
any
issue
with
the
california
court
as
to
what
the
cause
of
death
was
because
they
had
them
show
to
california
court
with
a
good
judgement.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
not
entirely
so.
no,
sir.
it
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
uniform
act
but
there
are
differences
between
some
of
the
states
that
i
know
of
at
least.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
don't
recall
any
substantial
ones.
so
the
california
act
is
similar
to
the
florida
act.
i
believe
the
schutt
case
was
passing
on
the
tennessee
act.
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
just
don't
know,
sir.
i
heard
counsel
make
that
statement.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
of
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
presumed
that
there
likely
was
a
number
of
years
ago,
exist
certain
instances
of
that
now
where
there
possibly
some
out
of
state
insurers
were
not
paying
their
claims
as
they
should.
and
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
an
act
which
would
compel
them
and
force
them
to
pay
them.
the
point
that
i
was
making
moment
ago,
sir,
was
that
i
doubt
that
that
situation
exist
generally
now.
i
think
that
you're
--
very
great
number
of
insurance
companies
do
not
fail
to
pay
claims
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
our
petition
forces
them
to.
it's
just
not
good
business
not
to
pay
them.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
none
--
none
whatsoever,
sir.
it
was
a
reinsurance
agreement
of
the
type
of,
in
effect,
reorganization
by
which
we
took
over
their
assets
and
agreed
to
either
give
their
policyholders
a
policy
or
to
let
them
have
their
proportionate
part
of
the
funds
of
the
empire
mutual.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
it
was
--
it
was
a
contract,
sir,
which
had
been,
of
course,
as
i
have
mentioned,
our
--
our
company
is
a
legal
reserve
company
is
controlled
by
its
board
of
directors.
the
arizona
corporation
was
a
benefit
corporation
and
was
controlled
by
its
members.
it
was
subject
to
a
membership
meeting,
mr.
justice,
also,
the
approval
of
the
corporation
commission
of
arizona
and
the
board
of
insurance
commissioners
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
so
far
as
--
sir?
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
wouldn't
think
so
because
so
far
as
i
know
there
was
no
greater
contact
between
empire
mutual
and
california
then
international.
the
stipulation
provides,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
had
mentioned,
that
nor
has
either
company,
in
any
way,
carried
on
any
business
activity
within
the
state
of
california
except
it
was
herein
stipulated
that
neither
before
nor
after
september
1st
which
was
the
date
of
reinsurers'
contract.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
as
i
construe
--
as
i
construe
your
opinions,
mr.
justice,
the
opinions
of
this
court,
it
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
there
had
been
activities
of
the
agent
of
the
corporation
within
the
state.
i
don't
think
it
could
be
said
that
you
could
say
that
the
mere
issuance
of
one
policy
or
50
policies
or
a
hundred
policies,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
again
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
--
we
can
make
it
--
we
can
make
it
such
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
mere
holding
of
the
policy,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
you
should
look
to
how
they
were
acquired.
now,
if
they
have
solicited
and
have
a
thousand
policies
on
the
state,
i
think,
the
situation
might
be
different,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that
is
true,
sir.
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
still
within
the
proposition
of
a
--
isolated
transaction.
if
--
if
there'd
be
not
some
such
rule,
such
as
that,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
situation
can
arise,
it
was
suggested
a
few
moments
ago
of
you
can
return
restrict
your
activities
to
one
state,
set
all
your
policies
there.
and
then
are
you
going
to
be
subjected
to
suit
in
every
state
and
the
union
provided
you
have
policyholder
moved
there.
i
don't
think
that's
should
be
the
law,
sir.
you
may
defer
with
me.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
well,
sir,
may
be
i
feel
pretty
strongly
about
it
having
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
docket
most
of
the
time.
but
i
fear,
in
all
sincerity,
than
in
many
instances,
the
insurance
companies
need
protection
from
the
policyholders
rather
than
the
policyholders
from
the
insurance
companies.
and
i
have
seen
it
happen
time
and
time
again.
and
i
think
it's
happening
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
think
that
--
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
that
should
and
should
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
would
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
agree
with
you
wholeheartedly,
sir,
that
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
made
the
remarks
to
that.
they
had
in
order
that
we
might
not
have
the
situation
exist
where
there
was
the
feeling
that
it
was
these
policyholders,
the
single
policyholder
who
needed
protection
of
the
california
statute.
i
think
definitely,
sir,
there
are
two
sides
to
it.
returning
briefly
to
the
discussion
of
the
travelers
versus
virginia,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
his
opinion,
of
course,
said
that
he
put
to
one
side
where
the
policyholder
seeks
to
sue
the
out
of
state
company
in
virginia.
but,
as
i
recall
it,
he
did
expressly
state
that
the
corporate
project
entails
the
use
of
one
or
more
people
in
the
state
of
the
solicitation
business.
and
certainly,
in
this
case,
we
did
not
have
that.
the
other
opinion,
of
course,
questions
the
fact
that
an
in
personam
judgment
can
be
based
on
service
by
registered
letter
or
substituted
service
on
a
corporation
which
is
never
been
within
the
state.
and
it's
pointed
out
again
that
the
minimum
contacts
set
out
in
the
international
shoe
company
case
are
the
activities
of
the
corporation's
agent
within
the
state.
i
think
if
we
examine
all
of
your
cases
that,
at
least,
i
have
been
able
to
find.
osborn
versus
ozlin,
of
course,
was
not
a
case
in
which
service
was
involved
but
was
a
suit
by
company
is
authorized
to
do
business
in
virginia
in
relation
to
the
virginia
statute.
your
hoopeston
canning
company
versus
cullen
was,
in
turn,
an
action
against
the
insurance
department
for
declaratory
judgment
challenging
the
constitutionality.
and,
of
course,
in
that
case,
there
were
engineers
sent
into
the
state.
there
were
investigations
made
before
the
people
were
accepted.
there
were
many,
many
contracts,
50,000,
i
believe,
during
the
seven-year
period,
$2,000,000
of
premiums
more
than
those
in
the
home
state.
then
this
court,
of
course,
took
up
the
perkins
case
and
reiterated
there,
your
holdings
of
the
international
shoe
company
case.
i
think
the
international
shoe
company
case
together
with
the
perkins
case
enunciate
the
rule
that
certainly,
there
can
be
no
personal
judgment
against
the
defendant
with
which
the
state
has
no
contacts,
it
has
relations.
and
you
cite
with
comparison
the
pennoyer
versus
neff,
the
benn
case.
certainly,
there
were
less
contacts
in
this
case,
which
we
now
arguing
before
the
court
than
there
were
in
the
benn
case
because
there,
they
were
doing
a
general
mail
order
business.
we
have
not
been
doing
a
general
mail
order
business
here.
it's
of
interest,
i
think,
to
see
the
reaction
that
the
circuit
courts
have
taken
to
some
of
the
opinions.
the
second
circuit
in
the
schutt
case,
construing
the
tennessee
statute,
says
that
the
constitutional
question
is
more
definite
of
solution.
and
it
seems
that
the
authority
of
the
benn
case
that
impaired
to
the
vanishing
point
by
travelers
health
association
versus
commonwealth
of
virginia,
and
says,
"perhaps,
in
the
end,
vestiges
of
the
old
physical
presence
theory
will
prevail."
however,
that
may
be,
we
will
agree
with
to
follow
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
international
shoe
and
travelers.
i
have
found
the
case
since
our
brief
was
written
by
the
ninth
circuit
said
on
may
22nd,
1956
of
vecke,
v-e-c-k-e,
versus
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
vecke,
v-e-c-k-e.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
v-e-c-k-e
versus
griesedieck,
g-r-i-e-s-e-d-i-e-c-k,
western
brewery
company.
the
citation
says
233
f.2d
772.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes,
sir,
772.
i
can't
pronounce
them
properly,
mr.
justice,
was
less
spell
them.
what
was
interesting
in
that
case,
there
were
two
brewery
distributors
involved.
one
of
them
didn't
have
an
office
or
any
particular
salesman
in
california
but
they
did
sell
directly
to
distributors.
and
once
or
twice,
the
president
of
the
company
or
some
of
its
other
officers
would
make
sales
promotion
trips
through
in
california.
and
it
did
furnish
the
distributor
with
stationary
and
advertising
and
authorized
it
to
settle
disputes
within
the
manufacturing
purchasers.
now,
the
other
beer
manufacturer
involved
did
maintain
an
office
in
california,
had
a
resident
manager
in
six
field
representatives
or
home
spent
considerable
amounts
of
time
in
california.
the
ninth
circuit
came
up
with
the
answer
that
the
--
and
the
district
court
in
both
instances
had
quashed
the
service
on
the
out
of
state
manufacturing
--
beer
manufacturers.
the
ninth
circuit
came
up
with
the
answer
that
the
quashing
of
the
citation
is
to
the
first
beer
manufacturer
even
though
there
were
substantial
sales
made,
that
--
that
was
proper,
and
it
was
interesting
to
me
the
comment
was
made
about
international
shoe
case.
the
contrary
rule,
moreover,
would
raise
grave
questions
of
due
process
of
law,
notwithstanding
the
reexamination
of
the
requisites
of
due
process
in
this
area
of
the
law
which
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
undertaken
and
such
cases
as
international
shoe
company
and
perkins
versus
benguet,
travelers
health
and
so
forth,
the
leading
case
of
cannon
manufacturing
company
versus
cudahy
packing
company,
a
case
in
which
the
local
contacts
of
the
foreign
manufacturing
corporation
far
exceeded
those
in
the
instant
case
has
not
been
overruled
and
more
significantly,
has
recently
been
cited
and
followed.
in
harris
versus
(inaudible)
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
1955
emery
versus
adams
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
1950.
so
they
held
that
even
though
there
were
substantial
sales
there,
that
they
were
not
subject
to
california
law.
at
least,
gentlemen,
we
find
the
circuit
court's
probably
in
some
confusion
about
the
issues
that
maybe
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i'm
afraid
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
--
i
can
see
no
valid
reason
though
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
i
can
see
no
valid
reason
why
the
rule
should
be
broader
in
favorable
of
a
beer
manufacturer
than
an
insurance
company
though,
sir.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
[laughs]
the
other
point
that
we
would
like
to
urge
is
this.
it
is
a--
an
apparent
deference
between
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
versus
iowa
state,
decided
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
1953.
iowa
state
was
doing
a
general
mail
order
business
in
florida.
and
the
florida
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
california
statute.
the
circuit
court
there
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
florida
statute
as
such
but
made
the,
to
me,
very
important
distinction
and
that
was
that
the
act
could
be
given
no
effect
which
will
impose
retroactively
the
provisions
upon
the
insurers
having
policies
enforced
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
this
distinction
marks
the
line
between
due
process
and
unauthorized
state
action.
now,
the
theory
upon
which
they
proceeded
in
upholding
the
act
was
that,
if
a
mail
order
insurer
wanted
to
go
in
to
a
state
and
solicit
business
there,
that
he
was
put
on
notice
and
charged
with
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
state
statute
that
says,
“if
you
come
in
here
and
do
a
mail
order
business,
then
you're
subjecting
yourself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
state.”
but
that
--
that
same
rule
would
not
apply
to
those
who
had
already
had
policies
enforced
in
the
state
because
they
had
issued
the
policies
without
any
such
notice.
and,
of
course,
that
is
the
situation
that
we
have
in
the
instant
case.
our
sincere
belief
is
that
the
minimum
contacts
which
this
respondent
has
had
with
california
did
not
justify,
holding
that
the
california
courts
acquire
jurisdiction
on
the
record
of
those
minimum
contacts.
in
addition,
we
do
urge
the
point
that
even
if
you
go
so
far,
and
it
will
be
for
the
gentlemen,
then
you
have
held
in
any
of
the
case
that
i
have
been
able
to
find.
i
have
found
no
other
case
in
which
this
court
or
any
other
court
has
held
that
an
out
of
state
corporation
could
be
subjected
where
they
had
no
agent
who
went
into
the
state,
either
through
members
or
as
investigators
or
in
some
capacity.
so
that
if
you
should
so
hold
in
this
court,
you
will
be
going
further,
i
think,
than
this
court
has
ever
gone
before.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
sir?
mr.
stanley
hornsby
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
say,
at
least,
that
there
had
to
be
solicitation
in
any
event.
i
personally
--
probably
i'm
old-fashioned
enough
to
where
i
would
extend
at
that
part,
sir.
but,
in
any
event,
i
think
that
she
would
not
be
justified
in
extending
jurisdiction
unless
there
has
been
some
type
of
solicitation
and
that
doesn't
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
from
this
--
from
this
standpoint
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
from
this
standpoint,
mr.
justice,
the
thought
occurs
to
me
that
there
should
be
some
right
on
the
part
of
the
person
of
the
corporation
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
going
to
subject
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
particular
state
under
a
statute
such
as
this.
now,
then,
if
it
goes
in
and
voluntarily
solicits,
then,
i
think,
the
argument
can
be
made,
although
i
don't
agree
with
it
personally
and
necessarily,
but
i
think
a
valid
argument
could
be
made
that
they
have
elected
to
come
within
the
provisions
of
that
statute.
but
if
you
say
we're
going
to
put
to
him
when
there
hasn't
been
that
contact,
that,
sir,
i
don't
think
should
be
done.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
they
had
no
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
they
had
no
alternative,
mr.
justice.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
because
you
couldn't
just
breach
the
contract
for
the
man.
now,
counsel
suggests
that
you
could
reinsure
it
with
some
other
company.
that
sounds
like
a
very
rapid
quick
suggestion
because
it's
not
possible
to
do
that.
you
don't
reinsure
one
isolated
contract
with
a
particular
company
where
the
policy
is
$1
a
month.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
it
was
a
contract,
i
doubt
very
--
i
doubt
very
serious,
mr.
justice,
if
the
company
knew
or
considered
that
there
was
a
policyholder
in
california.
most
of
the
policyholders
were
in
arizona
where
we
are
admitted
to
do
business
and
did
business.
mr.
stanley
hornsby
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
stanley
hornsby
that's
correct,
sir.
gentlemen,
we
do
urge
the
two
grounds
that
in
the
first
instance,
there
are
not
sufficient
contacts
shown
to
warrant,
subjecting
this
respondent
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
california
court.
and
the
second
one,
the
theory
of
the
(inaudible)
cases
that
the
policy
was
issued
prior
to
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
california
act.
thank
you.
