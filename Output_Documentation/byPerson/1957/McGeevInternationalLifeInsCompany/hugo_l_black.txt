justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
right
in
thinking,
probably,
the
case
just
stand
at
this
point
as
you
say
--
you
say
to
have
been
by
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
from
getting
served
the
company,
that
if
it
shows
nothing
more
had
been
done
by
the
state
and
show
one
person
by
mail
in
that
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
like
the
premium.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
valid
--
what
you
have
is
a
valid
insurance
policy
that
your
company
sent
to
him
by
the
mail,
paid
premiums
and
he
wants
to
sue
on
that.
the
question
is
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
(inaudible)
suing
in
california
made
here
or
whether
he
(inaudible)
in
some
place
by
the
company
whatever
it
is
doing
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
that's
the
one
addition,
the
thing
you
have
on
application
of
the
statute
(voice

--
justice
hugo

black
--
what
your
constitutional
question.
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
--
what
i
think?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
after
that
policy
had
been
in
effect
is
not
enough,
it's
so
little
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
permits
california
to
subject
your
company
suit
that
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
set
out
in
your
brief
that
there
are
some
reasons
separately
why
you
say
it
would
depend

sense
of
justice
of
the
contrary,
the
universal
ideas
of
fair
practice,
hold
the
company
subject
to
sue
and
the
state
made
issuance
of
policy
of
insurance
concerning
who

most

lawful
