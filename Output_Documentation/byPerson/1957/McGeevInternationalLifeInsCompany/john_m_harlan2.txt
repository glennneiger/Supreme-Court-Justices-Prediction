may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
case
was
tried
on
stipulation
of
facts.
and
the
reason
of
that
stipulation,
page
21,
as
i
get
it,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
insurance
company
had
ever
done
any
business
at
anytime
in
california
mailing
notice
a
part
of
the
transaction
with
this
particular
plaintiff,
your
client?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
uphold
the
statute
on
the
assumption
that
the
transactions
with
your
client
are
the
only
business
which
was
ever
done
by
this
company
in
california.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
only
transaction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
i've
got
in
mind
is
supposing
your
client
had
been
in
new
york
where
there
was
no
dispute,
this
insurance
company
was
doing
business,
then,
for
reasons
of
his
own,
in
part
of
california,
the
insurance
company
has
to
follow
premium
notices
and
he
just
--
they
have
to
send
him
--
send
the
notices
to
california
address.
would
you
think
that
that
kind
of
business
would
come
within
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
so
far
as
this
record
is
concern,
we
have
to
take
the
case
on
the
basis
that
the
only
business
that
this
company
did
in
california
was
mailing
premium
notices
to
your
client,

does
the
record
show
what
defense
was

where
was

in
california.
justice

all

under
your

with
