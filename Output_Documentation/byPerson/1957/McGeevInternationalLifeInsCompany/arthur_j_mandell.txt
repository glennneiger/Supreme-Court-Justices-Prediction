mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
genesis
of
this
case
began
on
april
4,
1944
when
the
empire
mutual
insurance
company
of
arizona
issued
a
policy
on
the
life
of
lowell
step
franklin
insuring
his
life
for
$5000.
he
named
as
his
beneficiary
his
mother
lulu
b.mcgee.
a
policy
was
mailed
by
the
empire
company
to
the
insurer
within
california,
and
he
continued
making
payments
of
premiums
to
empire
until
september
1st,
1948
when
the
empire
company
of
arizona
reinsured
its
risks
with
the
international
life
insurance
company
of
austin,
texas.
based
upon
this
reassurance
agreement
approved
by
both
governmental
agencies
of
arizona
in
texas,
the
international
company
issued
its
certificate
of
reinsurance
and
mailed
it
to
the
insured
in
california.
on
september
1st,
1948
until
some
time
to
december
of
1950,
the
insured
franklin
received
notices
by
mail
of
the
premiums
due
and
mailed
his
premiums
from
california
to
texas
and
was
fully
paid-up
when,
on
december
11,
1950,
he
died.
subsequent
thereto,
a
claim
was
made
on
behalf
of
lulu
b.mcgee,
his
mother,
the
beneficiary,
and
the
claim
was
denied.
on
june
11,
1951,
lulu
b.mcgee,
through
her
california
attorneys,
file
a
suit
--
filed
a
suit
in
san
francisco
against
the
international.
and
the
international,
not
having
qualified
to
do
business
in
california
as
required
by
the
california
statute
and
not
having
designated
anyone
to
accept
service,
the
california
attorney
proceeded
under
the
unauthorized
insurers
practice
act
which
was
passed
on
october
1,
1949.
therefore,
after
the
passage
of
the
act
on
october
1st,
1949,
throughout
the
rest
of
the
life
of
franklin,
through
december
1950,
the
international
insurance
company
from
texas
mailed
notices
of
premiums
to
california
to
franklin
and
--
and
reply
to
such
notices
received
by
mail,
the
premiums
in
texas.
the
--
the
petitioner
here,
and
plaintiff
below,
complied
fully
with
the
unauthorized
insurers
practice
act
as
required
by
the
california
statute.
no
attack
has
been
made
and
is
made
now
on
the
proposition
that
the
statute
was
not
followed
with
reference
to
service.
judgment
by
default
in
accordance
with
the
california
practice
was
rendered
in
october
1951.
the
judgment
was
forwarded
to
the
texas
attorneys
who
filed
the
suit
in
the
district
court
of
harris
county,
texas
to
collect
upon
the
california
judgment.
the
district
court
denied
recovery
on
the
judgment.
an
appeal
was
made
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
texas
who
affirmed
the
denial
of
recovery
by
the
district
judge
on
the
authority
of
(inaudible)
case
from
the
fifth
circuit.
most
important
hearing
and
application
for
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
followed
and
was
denied,
an
application
for
the
writ
was
filed
and
this
court
didn't
grant
it.
the
question
for
decision
here
is
whether
california
had
the
right
to
pass
the
unauthorized
insurer's
practice
act
and
set
out
therein
the
act
which
if
an
insurance
company
does
within
the
state
subjects
it
--
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
california
under
the
unauthorized
practice
act.
some
of
the
conditions
set
out
in
the
unauthorized
practice
act,
which
the
california
legislature,
in
its
own
wisdom,
saw
fit
to
include
as
making
that
--
insure
such
insurance
company
subject
to
its
process
in
accordance
with
the
rules
laid
down
included
the
mailing
of
notices
or
the
collection
of
premiums
from
one
state
into
the
state
of
california
and
the
receiving
of
premium
payments
from
california
and
any
other
act
or
transaction
with
the
policyholders
in
the
state
of
california.
by
stipulation,
it
is,
of
course,
conceded
that
section
3
and
4
of
the
unauthorized
practice
act,
which
deals
with
the
mailing
of
notices
or
notices
by
mail,
has
been
complied
with.
secondly,
a
claim
was
made
in
california
mailed
to
texas,
the
claim
was
denied.
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
(inaudible)
case
held
a
statute
similar
to
this
constitutional
but
stated
there
that
it
would
not
apply
if
the
contracts
of
insurance
were
issued
prior
to
the
time
that
the
unauthorized
insurers
practice
act
was
passed.
and
in
subsequent
cases
on
206
f.2d
and
207
f.2d
denied
recovery
on
that
ground,
it's
because
of
these
decisions
that
it
got
us
from
court
of
civil
appeals
refused
recovery
in
this
case.
it
is
petitioner's
position
here
that
the
decision
of
this
court
and
the
travelers
health
insurance
company
--
virginia
versus
travelers
health
insurance
company
in
70
supreme
court,
339
u.s.643,
is
authority
for
our
proposition
that
all
the
act
done
by
the
international
in
california
under
the
california
statute
subject
to
her
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
that
statute
complies
with
all
the
requirements
of
due
process
because
in
it,
not
only
does
it
appoint
a
person
to
receive
process
but
also
requires
that
a
copy
of
the
pleading
in
the
process
being
mailed
by
registered
mail
to
the
defendant,
the
insurance
company,
and
in
order
to
protect
the
insurance
company
further,
the
statute
provides
that
in
the
event
the
respondent
feels
that
it
is
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction,
it
may
come
to
california,
file
a
motion
to
quash
the
service
on
the
ground
that
they
didn't
do
any
of
the
four
acts
which
the
state
of
california
provides
constituting
sufficient
grant
to
subject
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
california.
and
if
sustained,
it
will
not
consider
that
as
an
appearance
in
court.
international
didn't
do
any
of
these
things.
it
sent
back
and
let
the
case
proceed.
and
defendant
on
the
ground,
first,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
act
itself
is
unconstitutional.
second,
that
the
act,
as
applied
to
them
in
this
instance,
is
unconstitutional.
and
third,
that
the
fact
that
--
that
the
certificate
of
insurance
was
issued
subsequent
--
i'm
sorry,
the
fact
that
a
certificate
of
insurance
was
issued
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
california
act
makes
them
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
we
submit
that
under
the
authority
of
the
travelers
case
and
of
the
schutt
case
decided
by
the
second
circuit,
the
international
was
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
--
of
the
court
of
california.
section
1611
and
1610
of
the
act
sets
out
pretty
clearly,
so
that
anyone
doing
business
in
that
state
may
know
exactly
what
are
selling
an
insurance
policy
or
mailing
any
notices
may
know
exactly
what
it
may
or
may
not
do
before
it
subjects
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
state.
in
that
section,
we
submit
that
a
mailing
of
notices
for
collection
of
premiums
has
been
declared
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california
sufficient
to
do
business
and
that
state
to
subject
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
there
is
no
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
the
--
insofar
as
this
record
is
concerned,
we
say
that
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
they
had
done
business
in
this
instance.
there
is
no
negative
stipulation
of
any
other
business.
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
record,
the
evidence
here
is
that
that's
the
only
thing
they
have
known.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
of
course
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
of
course,
these
are
not
the
facts
in
this
case
but
assuming
the
facts
in
this
case
that
a
man
might
have
lived
in
--
in
texas
where
unquestionably,
the
international
was
doing
business,
it
was
organized
in
texas
and
has
moved
to
california,
and
if
the
international
saw
fit
not
to
subject
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
california
by
way
of
process,
it
could
have
taken
steps
to
reinsure
its
risks
with
some
other
insurance
company
that
does
business
in
texas.
that
is
done
all
the
time.
it
had
its
choice.
it
could
have
easily
done
so
had
it
so
desired.
and,
of
course,
as
this
--
without
question
that
they
are
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
law
and
having
been
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
law,
they
could
have
easily
decided.
we
don't
want
to
subject
ourselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
california.
and
they
had
three
months
time
within
which
next
premium
was
due
and
reinsure
this
risk.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
nothing
more.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
now,
the
--
the
question
is
one
really
whether
the
state
of
california
has
to
write
an
authority
in
the
protection
of
its
citizens
to
set
up
this
type
of
regulations
or
methods
or
procedure.
now,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
when
the
admiral
has
passed
the
legislature
so
fit
to
state
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
in
its
purpose,
it
states
that
whereas
certain
insurance
companies
had
issued
policies
of
insurance
to
citizens
of
the
state
and
whereas
it
will
be
--
may
become
necessary
for
such
citizens
of
the
state
of
california
to
enforce
the
payment
of
such
policies,
policies
that
had
heretofore
been
issued
and
--
and
therefore,
passes
this
act.
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
the
--
it
is
clear
upon
the
act
that
california
passed
that
legislature
intended
it
to
apply
to
policies
then
existing
and
not
like
the
fifth
circuit
decided,
that
it
need
not
apply
to
--
retroactively
to
file
insurance
policies
issued
before
the
passage
of
the
act.
because
the
very
language
of
the
act
says
it
is
here
to
protect
those
citizens
who
now
have
policies
and
whom
may
have
to
sue
in
order
to
collect
these
policies.
and
its
unfair
and
unjust
for
these
citizens
to
have
to
go
and
--
to
other
states
in
policies
which
are
unbearably
are
small,
seek
counsel
in
far
away
states
to
enforce
their
rights.
now,
this
--
the
question
before
this
court
is,
had
california
the
right,
the
constitutional
authority
to
pass
such
a
statute?
and
we
submit
that
it
did.
now,
the
contention
has
been
made
and
i
suppose
it's
implicit
in
the
opinion
under
galveston
court
of
civil
appeals
that
it
is
unconstitutional
in
its
application
in
this
case
because
of
its
retroactive
nature
and
that
the
policy
was
issued
in
1948
and
the
act
was
not
passed
on
1949.
but
we
submit
that
service
of
process
is
a
procedural
matter.
no
one
--
this
court
has
said
and
many
courts
have
said
as
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
sued
anywhere.
the
question
is
does
the
procedure
of
issuing
the
process
meet
the
requirements
said
by
this
court
of
which
simply
is,
does
it
--
does
such
suit
not
offend
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice.
now,
then,
apply
this
principle
to
the
case
at
bar.
the
respondent
had
notice
of
it,
had
an
opportunity
to
present
itself
in
california
if
it
--
if
it
for
thought
that
it
was
not
subject
to
the
california
court
present
this
motion
and
if
not
subject
to
it
--
in
other
words,
if
it
didn't
come
under
the
three
subdivisions
set
out
by
the
statute,
then
it
would
have
been
clear.
had
it
not
been
clear
of
the
jurisdiction,
then
proper
exceptions
on
appeal
could
have
followed
but
respondent
choose
not
to
do
so.
this
is
a
small
policy,
a
$5000
policy
and
it's
just
these
kind
of
policies
that
at
least
38
states
have
sought
to
protect
and
hence,
the
passage
of
this
act.
it
would
have
been
much
more
onwards
and
certainly,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california
thought
so,
to
have
imposed
the
burden
on
lulu
mcgee
to
come
to
texas
to
file
a
suit.
we
submit
that
the
(inaudible)
case
in
229
f.2d
decided
by
the
second
circuit
on
the
authority
of
the
travelers
case
decided
by
this
court
is
federal
authority,
that
in
cases
such
as
these,
and
act
such
as
passed
by
the
california
statute
is
enforceable
and
is
not
on
contravention
of
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
few
more
minutes
that
i
have
to
reply.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
the
record
does
not
show
what
the
defense
was
except
that
in
the
trial
in
texas
which
was
simply
a
trial
upon
the
judgement,
the
international
insurance
company
did
plead
to
the
--
a
defense.
a
defense
that
the
deceased
committed
suicide
while
insane
claiming
that
that
was
an
exception
to
the
policy.
however,
and
so
to
introduce
as
prove
thereof,
the
proof
of
claim
made
by
lulu
mcgee
on
exception
by
counsel
for
mcgee,
the
court
did
not
admit
such
evidence
because
the
question
before
the
court
was
the
validity
of
the
judgement
itself.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
makes
known
of
this
fact
and
says
--
sets
out
a
defense
to
the
policy
is
not
here
material.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
may
it
--
may
it
please
the
court.
so
there
maybe
no
misunderstanding,
although
i
think
the
stipulation
is
very
clear,
the
first
insurance
company,
the
empire,
issued
its
policy
to
the
insured
and
mailed
it
to
him
in
california.
it
was
in
existence
and
premiums
were
paid
from
california
to
arizona
until
1948.
in
1948,
the
empire
assets
and
liabilities
were
taken
over
by
the
international
of
texas.
it
is
--
it
may
be,
as
counsel
stated,
that
they
didn't
know,
international
didn't
know
that
it
was
one
or
more
insurance
policies
in
california.
whether
it
did
or
did
not,
we
don't
know
but
certainly,
it
was
there
for
them
to
know
if
they
sought
that
they
find
out.
secondly,
the
premiums
were
paid
to
international
after
they
took
it
over
until
this
man's
death.
now,
the
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
there
were,
i
believe,
four
or
five
quarterly
premiums.
now,
the
fact
that
there
was
only
a
$1
premium
per
month
or
$3
quarterly
or
$300
or
$30,000,
i
see,
can
have
no
material
effect
on
the
decision
of
this
case.
the
principle
is
exactly
the
same.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california
saw
fit
to
pass
this
act
in
order
to
protect
the
little
policyholders.
that's
what
it
had
in
mind
and
it
so
states
in
the
enabling
clause
of
the
act.
now,
it
may
be
that
what
counsel
for
respondent
said
that
to
pay
a
claim
such
as
this
and
the
record
here
is
certainly,
sullen
of
his
validity
or
invalidity
on
the
contrary,
insofar
as
this
court
are
concerned
and
must
assume
that
it
was
a
valid
claim
because
it
comes
from
a
judgment
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
of
the
state
of
california.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
except
a
pleading,
which
may
suggest
otherwise.
nothing
whatsoever
that
it's
--
the
claim
is
not
valid
or
it
has
any
infirmities.
now,
it
maybe
that
by
paying
this
claim,
it
may
or
by
subjecting
the
california
--
the
international
to
the
california
jurisdiction,
may
or
may
not
work
a
hardship
on
the
rest
of
the
policyholders.
let's
assume
for
argument
sake
that
it
might,
the
place
for
such
a
complaint
is
before
the
legislature
of
the
state
where
the
act
was
passed
unless
the
act,
in
itself,
is
so
capricious
and
obituary
as
to
do
violence
to
the
constitution.
now
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
that
they
have
received
notice
by
registered
mail
of
the
institution
of
the
action
after
notice.
so
that's
why
i
made
the
point
before
that
california,
unlike
texas,
is
given
the
insurance
company
the
right
to
come
here
and
challenge
the
jurisdiction
without
subjecting
itself
to
it.
now
--
so
the
question
now
remains,
as
i
see
it,
whether
in
this
instance
where
one
insurance
policy
was
issued
and
premiums
were
received
in
one
insurance
policy,
does
that
subject
the
--
does
this
--
this
one
act,
take
it
out
of
the
provision
of
the
statute.
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
we
must
look
at
the
statute
itself.
the
statute,
and
we
set
it
out
in
--
it
set
out
on
page
55
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
sets
at
a
reason
for
the
statute
and
it
says,
"the
legislature
declares
that
it
is
a
subject
of
concern
that
non
admitted
insurers
have
issued
policies
of
insurance
to
residents
of
this
state
physically
present
herein
at
the
time
of
such
issuance,
thus
presenting
to
such
residents
the
often
insuperable
obstacle
of
resorting
to
distant
forums
for
the
purpose
of
asserting
legal
rights
under
such
policies,
policies
that
have
heretofore
been
issued.”
then,
in
order
to
clarify
and
give
notice
to
all
those
in
interest
as
to
what
acts
they
are
talking
about
on
page
57
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
it's
set
out.
one
of
out
of
two,
the
solicitation
of
application
for
such
contracts,
three,
wholly
independent
of
number
two,
the
collection
of
premiums,
membership
fees,
assessments
or
under
considerations
for
such
contract.
now,
it
--
it's
undisputed
that
number
--
certainly,
they
did
the
act
in
number
three.
number
four,
any
other
transaction
of
business
arising
out
of
such
contracts
and
the
other
transaction
is
the
receiving
of
the
claim,
the
denial
of
the
claim.
now,
this
very
question
of
whether
the
validity
of
this
process
can
be
tested
with
reference
to
the
time
when
the
insurance
certificate
was
issued,
was
answered
in
the
negative
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
schutt
case,
and
that
is
229
f.2d
158,
and
it's
cited
in
both
briefs.
but
moreover,
this
court,
in
the
travelers
case
said
this
--
in
virginia
versus
travelers,
whether
such
solicitation
is
isolate
or
continuous,
it
is
activity
which
virginia
can
regulate.
this
court
has
sanctioned
such
provision.
moreover,
the
--
in
new
jersey,
i
believe,
the
boches
verus
miami
air
line,
111
f.supp.
there,
the
miami
air
line,
from
time
to
time,
flew
over
new
jersey,
orlando
there
and
sometimes
thereafter.
new
jersey
passed
the
statute
making
it
a
minimal
to
process.
miami
air
line
claimed
that
that
was
a
retroactive
statute
and
therefore,
it
was
not
applicable
to
it.
the
district
judge,
federal
district
judge
held,
of
course,
like
many
other
decision,
that
as
long
as
it
give
the
opposite
party
fair
notice,
the
issuance
of
process
was
a
matter
of
procedure
and
did
not
affect
any
substantive
rights.
now,
in
the
schutt
case,
which
held
the
retroactive
feature
of
the
--
of
the
process
is
no
invalidity,
just
contrary
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
second
circuit
discussed
what
acts
constitute
sufficient
ground
to
assume
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
now,
evidently,
the
state
of
tennessee
has
passed
an
act
exactly
like
the
one
in
california.
and
the
court
said,
"certainly,
the
mailing
of
the
premium
notices
and
the
remittance
of
premium
payments
and
the
submission
of
proofs
of
death
constitute
the
doing
of
any
act
whatsoever
whether
interstate
or
intrastate
in
nature
exactly,"
as
what's
done
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
company
is
at
one
end
or
the
other
of
each
of
these
activities
and
one
end
is
in
new
york
and
the
other
end
is
in
tennessee.
the
noble
argument
of
the
great
number
of
insurance
companies
paid
their
just
claims
which
would
have
any
relevancy
in
this
matter,
i
--
i
just
don't
see
how
it
could.
but
historically
speaking,
during
the
last
two
or
three
years
in
texas,
at
least,
we've
had
some
disastrous
experiences
with
insurance
companies.
and
the
kind
of
statement
made
by
counsel
for
respondent
does
not
fit
in
with
the
facts
at
pleasanton,
texas.
and
i
may
say
this,
that
the
brewery
case,
as
cited
by
counsel
for
respondent,
differs
with
the
case
at
bar
in
that
in
those
cases,
the
particular
state
saw
fit
not
to
make
--
not
to
pass
a
statute
covering
this
situation.
the
statute
here
was
passed
to
meet
the
need
and
for
this
court
to
set
a
test
or
whether
issuing
one
policy
or
two
policy
or
50
policies
before
they
can
be
subjected
to
the
provision
of
the
act
is
to
make
an
unrealistic
test
and
to
deprive
these
policyholders
of
their
rights
under
the
law
as
given
in
their
respective
states.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
now,
my
--
my
interpretation
of
the
last
clause
is
not
the
one
that
you,
justice
frankfurter,
arrived
at.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
--
i
mean
suggest
now.
i'm
sorry.
the
word
we
thought
we
said
that
insofar
as
we
know
the
only
thing
that
we
stipulated
to
was
that
this
transaction,
so
far
as
this
insured
is
concerned,
that's
all
they
have
done.
did
they've
done
anything
else,
we
don't
know
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
it's
a
negative
stipulation.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
franklin,
the
insured.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
--
i
think,
as
far
as
we
know,
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
the
reason
i
say,
sir,
that
your
construction
--
your
suggestive
construction
maybe
different
is
that
when
we
entered
under
this
stipulation,
we
entered
in
a
stipulation
of
facts
we
knew
at
that
time.
all
we
know
at
that
time
is
that
they
have
done
this
things
with
franklin.
and
i
submit,
as
forcefully
as
i
know
how,
that
that
one
--
that
number
of
transactions
with
one
policyholder
is
sufficient
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
--
to
come
under
the
act.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
--
i
assume
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
that
is
correct,
sir.
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
and
that
--
and
that
respect
is
different
from
schutt
but
we
read
it
by
justice
black's
statement
and
to
virginia
case
in
which
he
says
and
this
court
says
whether
such
solicitation
is
isolate
or
continuous.
it
is
the
activity
which
virginia
can
regulate.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
we
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
california
statute.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
whether
it
contravenes
the
principle
that
this
court
has
said
in
or
i
asked
you
fair
play
and
proper
notice.
that
simply
is
the
thing.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
i
--
i
suppose
they
do
except,
your
honor,
that
i
can
see
where
respondent
may
--
made
--
made
the
very
caution
answer
that
somebody
was
physically
present
in
the
state.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
suppose
that
if
i
were
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
--
i
suppose
if
i
were
on
the
other
side
and
we
put
(inaudible)
for
an
answer,
that's
the
answer
that
would
come
to
my
mind.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
there
were
just
once
and
they
were
here
by
mail
a
number
of
times.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
it
maybe
many
other
insurance
companies.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
have
never
answered
my
case
from
justices
before
and
i
appreciate
that
very
much.
thank
you.
[laughter]
