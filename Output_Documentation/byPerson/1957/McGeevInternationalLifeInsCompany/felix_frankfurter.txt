are
you
--
are
you
--
i
take
it,
you
can
take
up
each
one
of
these
points
separately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
not?
and
when
you
said,
"as
of
the
second
point,"
you
will
assume
--
you
will
assume
that
prospectively
or
as
to
prospective
policy,
such
a
statute
is
constitutional
part
--
apply
retrospectively
violates
due
process.
did
you
proceed
to
that?
(inaudible),
that
is
your
second
point,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
second
point,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
assuming,
but
i
mean
on
start
with
the
assumption,
this
statute
is
all
right
as
to
all
future
policy.
and
you
say
it
has
an
infirmity
if
this
applied
to
policies
thereto
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
your
--
as
i
get
it,
your
feeling
derives
from
the
assumption
that
here
was
an
invalid
claim,
doesn't
it,
and
you
--
you
say,
“this
is
an
invalid
claim,
a
lot
of
invalid
claim.”
isn't
that
true?
isn't
that
--
and
that
payment,
an
invalid
claim,
of
course,
cast
a
burden
on
--
under
(inaudible)
thereby
affecting
the
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
starting
point
of
that
feeling
or
that
view
is
a
unilateral
determination
that
the
claims
were
invalid.
one
can't
--
can't
(inaudible)
i
have
without
realizing
how
things
would
seem
awfully
clear
to
one
side,
assume
a
different
aspect
on
the
other
side
get
something
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

the
record.
anybody
that
has
been
into
court
knows
how
surprising
sometimes
it
is,
as
otherwise
inclusive
case,
not
so
conclusive
as
to
the
other
fact
it's
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
there
--
of
course,
different
considerations
enter
into
legislation
affecting
the
insurance
company
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
afraid
it
did
not.
the
scopes
of
constitutional
authority
are
very
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
brewery
--
the
brewery
sales
and
insurance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
all
before
there
was
ever
legislation
governing
any
business,
insurance
business
(inaudible)
brewery
itself.
i
don't
think
it
minimizes
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you,
yourself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you,
yourself,
extend
what
you've
just
said
to
solicitation
you
will
add
on
the
(inaudible)
must
of
the
--
must
of
the
--
the
human
enticement,
must
of
the
--
the
(inaudible)
talk
rather
than
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
made
comment
or
you
have.
i'm
sorry
to
have
missed
it
but
the
stipulation,
the
last
clause
on
page
21,
isolated.
what
is
you
comment
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
derived
that
yet.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
by
this
transaction,
you
don't
mean,
or
do
you,
this
type
of
transaction,
you
mean
this
--
this
thing
to
transaction
has
decreed
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
(inaudible)
there
was
no
other
--
there's
no
other
such
policyholder
reinsured
by
the
respondent,
resident
of
california.
is
that
what
this
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
why
--
why
do
you
say
your
construction
is
different?
this
is
the
only
--
this
is
an
isolated
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
wasn't
directing
myself
to
the
legal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
your
position
but
it
is
the
fact
or
i
wonder
whether
one
could
read
this
otherwise
then
you
have
a
record
in
which
there
was
(inaudible)
and
acknowledgement
of
this
particular
policyholder
but
there
is
allegation
negatively
that
there
was
a
cause
of
business
with
a
lot
of
other
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
that
respect,
you
created
from
schutt
or
schutt.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
all
i
meant
--
i
wanted
to
--
to
find
the
issue
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
get
down
to
--
to
the
contention,
your
contention
that
although
this
statute
falls
on
the
situation
in
which
there
was
but
one
outstanding
policy
related
to
this
texas
corporation
that
is
within
the
statute,
as
you
read
the
statute
we
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
bound
by
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
we
are.
are
we?
is
there
--
is
there
a
california
ruling
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
assumed,
this
whole
litigation
is
on
the
assumption
that
the
texas
statute
was
properly
applied
to
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
california
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
your
--
your
constitutional
question
here
is
--
the
problem
here
is,
assuming
that
the
incident
of
this
california
statute
is
by
the
single
policy
and
nothing
else
that
it's
a
valid
(inaudible)
constitutional
policy.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
--
since
you
were
so
commendably
fair
in
putting
the
answer
to
your
problem,
the
result
of
which
do
not
fear,
the
answer
isn't
good
enough
anyhow.
i
suppose
another
answer
is
you
better
hold
currents
of
people
going
interstate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
case.
