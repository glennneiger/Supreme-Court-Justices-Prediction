mr.
richard
c.
butler
your
honor
in
connection
with
this
case,
i
have
mr.
john
hailey
of
little
rock
arkansas,
who
is
not
yet
a
member
of
this
court.
he
is
substituting
for
mr.
a.
f.
house.
i
have
also
as
co-counsel
the
president
of
the
little
rock
school
board,
who
is
an
attorney
mr.
(inaudible)
and
we
do
not
know
at
this
point
your
honor
whether
they
will
participate
in
argument
or
not,
we
do
not
anticipate
that
they
will.
we
did
not
know
the
order
until
your
honor
just
announced
and
if
we
have
the
rebuttal
then
i
shall
probably
carry
the
burden
of
all
of
the
argument.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
thank
you.
and
your
honor
one
other
thing
i
don't
know
that
it's
been
made
a
matter
of
record
yet
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
announced,
the
honorable
william
fulbright,
united
states
senator
from
arkansas
has
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
brief
together
with
the
brief.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
mr.
fulbright
is
present.
he
does
not
expect
to
participate
in
the
argument.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
may
it
please
your
honors?
to
straighten
out
a
few
things
that
counsel
for
the
naacp
may
not
have
been
aware
of,
your
clerk
called
me
several
days
ago,
after
taking
with
the
clerk
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
finding
that
the
record
of
that
court
had
been
returned
to
little
rock.
i
located
it,
and
mailed
it
here
immediately
and
it
is
my
information
that
the
entire
record
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
here
in
your
clerk's
office.
that
has
attached
to
it
three
such
typewritten
volumes
that
each
of
about
this
size,
which
shows
all
of
the
testimony
that
was
given
in
before
judge
lemley
in
approximately
three-day
hearing
in
his
court,
in
june.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
large
packet
as
counsel
has
referred
to,
of
various
exhibits.
they
were
not
identified
each
separately
but
were
introduced
as
a
packet.
they
were
largely
newspaper
items
which
judge
lemley
took
into
consideration
to
show
the
confusion
and
turmoil
and
the
position
that
this
school
board
was
put
in.
i
thought
that
might
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
know
that.
one
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
mention
in
passing
at
the
beginning,
which
i
think
counsel
was
somewhat
confused
on
or
uninformed
on.
at
the
time
this
school
board
requested
a
temporary
stay,
purely
temporary,
before
judge
davies
in
september
of
1957,
the
troops,
national
guard
had
either
been
ordered
out
or
it
was
known
that
they
were
to
be
ordered
out.
and
at
that
time
there
was
an
injunction
that
had
been
ordered
by
the
local
chancery
court,
directing
this
school
board
to
do
exactly
opposite
from
what
had
been
planned
and
what
judge
miller
had
ordered
in
august
of
1956.
now
that
was
the
purpose
behind
the
school
board
going
into
court
at
that
time
and
asking
merely
for
a
temporary
delay,
they
did
that
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place
they
were
caught
in
an
untenable
position.
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
been
there
continuously
since
then
up
to
this
very
day.
they
also
felt
that
under
the
circumstances
with
troops
moving
in
and
out
of
the
city
and
perhaps
strife
and
turmoil
to
follow,
that
the
wise
thing
to
do
was
for
the
court
to
have
an
opportunity
to
tell
it,
the
school
board,
what
it
should
do
under
those
circumstances.
the
school
board
felt
that
a
temporary,
not
the
kind
of
delay
that
judge
lemley
had
given
over
a
long
period
of
time,
two-and-a-half
years,
but
for
that
immediate
situation,
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
it
clarified.
a
third
reason
for
the
school
board
to
go
in
at
that
particular
time
before
judge
davies,
was
that
here
they
were
ordered
by
two
different
courts,
to
do
exactly
opposite
things,
or
at
least
partially
opposite,
and
they
felt
on
advice
of
counsel
that
it
was
advisable
for
them
to
show
that
there
was
no
motive
on
their
part
of
contempt
of
the
federal
court
order.
now,
i
think
those
are
the
reasons
behind
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
petition
for
delay
of
september
1957.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
recall
it
rather,
those
were
combined,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
think
it
had
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
your
honor
so
many
things
have
happened
since
then.
i
would
prefer
to
refer
to
the
record
itself
rather
than
rely
on
my
memory
even
though
i
was
present.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir
not
at
the
moment,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
they
are
not
acting
under
any
other
compulsion.
now
there
are
acts
one
and
that's
one
other
thing
that
i
wanted
to
mention,
and
that
is
there
has
been
some
statement
of
the
delay
of
the
school
board
in
opening
the
high
schools
in
little
rock
or
all
of
the
schools,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
school
board
on
its
own
motion
let
us
say,
postponed
it
until
september
the
8th.
there
is
a
statute
which
will
be
passed,
i
think
it
has
already
been
passed,
if
not
it
will
be
passed
today,
postponing
the
opening
of
school
until
september
the
15th,
that
is
my
information.
now
of
course
the
school
board
would
have
to
obey
the
statute
in
regard
to
opening
or
closing
school,
because
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
time
for
registration
originally
is
about
nine.
i
have
the
president
of
the
school
board
here
with
me,
he
is
the
counsel
and
--
they
have
already
had
registration
i'm
informed
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
don't
think
it
affects
registration,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
these
petitioners
are
registered
under
the
order
of
judge
lemley's
delay,
under
his
order,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
that
is
my
information,
that
they
are
already
registered
in
the
school
that
they
originally
were
in.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
perhaps,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
there
is
some
doubt
about
it.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
that
was
the
intervening
circumstance
and
the
stay
ordered
by
the
eighth
circuit,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
i
must
suggest
–
mr.
richard
c.
butler
oh
yes,
they
oh
yes
they
were
registered.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
oh
yes,
yes
sir.
yes
and
in
september
of
'57
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
in
september
of
'57
they
were
registered
in
central
high
school
and
remained
there
all
during
the
school
year
both
on
registration
and
physical
being
there.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
legally
that
is
correct
yes,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
it
has
not
decided
because
it's
almost
compelled
to
see
what
statutes
are
passed
by
the
general
assembly
now
in
session
and
various
other
things
which
it
has
no
way
of
determining.
and
this
school,
school
board
no
doubt
will
have
to
meet
those
situations
as
they
arise,
as
they
have
had
to
do
all
the
past
year.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir
it
has
not,
it
has
not
been
revoked,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
is
my
affirmation
mr.
chief
justice
that
they
have
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
they
have
not
--
yes
sir
they
have
now
been
assigned
to
the
all
negro
school,
the
new
high
school
there
of
horace
mann.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
oh!
yes
sir
it
is.
it
is,
that
and
that
was
done,
that
was
done
under
the
order
of
judge
lemley's
decision.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
now
that
the
school
board
president
informed
me
and
of
course
he
is
correct
hat
that
we
don't
know
that
they
have
actually
been
registered.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
point
i
was
making
a
moment
ago
is
that
registration
generally
of
most
of
the
students
in
little
rock
has
been
accomplished
within
the
last
few
days.
now
actually
these
students
that
are
in
question
have
been
up
here,
they
have
been
traveling
around,
i
doubt
that
since
even
the
school
superintendent
has
been
gone
for
the
last
couple
of
days
whether
he
knows
that
these
--
that
all
of
these
particular
students
have
actually
registered.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
registration
simply
involves
the
request
by
the
student
himself
under
general,
under
the
general
rules
of
the
school
board
to
indicate
that
he
is
planning
to
attend
that
particular
school
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
--
that
day.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
at
the
school
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
each
school
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
oh!
yes
all
students
must
register,
yes
sir.
all
students
and
that
has
been
the
customary
practice
for
years.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
oh
yes
they
are
registered
so
that
the
school
authorities
will
know
who
is
going
to
be
where
and
how
many
they
can
expect.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
do
not
know
whether
they
have
appeared
there
or
anywhere
else
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
point
i
was
making
a
moment
ago
in
answered
one
of
other
justice's
question
was
that
registration
generally
in
little
rock
has
already
been
accomplished
and
just
within
the
past
few
days.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
we
do.
many
transfers
are
made
from
time
to
time.
each
transfer
is
taken
up
on
its
own
merits
and
ordinarily
if
the
family
moves
from
one
geographical
location
to
another
or
for
various
other
reasons
they
are
transferred
during
the
school
year
that
is
not
an
uncustomary
proceeding.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
no
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
mr.
chief
justice
in
little
rock
until
this
past
year
it
was,
and
for
the
past
70
years
ever
since
there
has
been
a
public
school
system
in
little
rock,
it
has
been
segregated
in
the
public
school
systems
there.
so
there
has
never
theretofore
been
any
transfer
from
negro
schools
to
white
school
or
vice
versa.
the
transfer
of
pupils
from
one
school
to
another
whether
it's
white
or
negro
is
a
process
that
goes
on
every
school
year,
not
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
year,
that's
when
they
all
register.
and
ordinarily
those
students
stay
in
that
particular
school,
the
balance
of
that
year,
but
there
are
many
exceptions
to
that
and
there
are
transfers
during
the
course
of
the
year.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
as
a
practical
matter
that
was
the
only
one,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
there
were
three
--
there
were
three
high
schools,
central
high
school,
horace
mann
high
school
and
hall
high
school.
horace
mann
high
school
is
a
new
school
so
is
hall
high
school.
central
high
school
has
been
in
its
present
physical
plan
for
some
25
to
30
years.
the
only
applicants
that
were
made
for
any
racial
mixing
or
integration
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
–
mr.
richard
c.
butler
--
was
at
central
high
school
and
some
17
first
started
out
becoming
eligible
for
that.
there
were
70
some
odd
applied.
for
various
reasons
they
withdrew
either
voluntarily
or
otherwise
and
it
finally
came
down
to
nine
and
ended
up
the
school
year
with
seven.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
oh!
no,
no
sir
you
wouldn't
have
to
wait
a
year,
they
--
the
point
that
i
am
making
and
i
think
mr.
justice
clark
what
you
are
asking
is
the
registration
at
the
beginning
of
school
is
not
necessarily
held
in
(inaudible)
during
the
entire
school
year.
now
they
try
to
just
for
the
sake
of
continuity
to
keep
as
many
children
as
possible
in
a
particular
school,
but
there
are
various
circumstances
as
i
understand
that
come
up
throughout
the
year
whereby
pupils
are
permitted
to
transfer
from
one
school
to
another.
i
trust
i
have
answered
your
question
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
i
know
of
no
reason
why
that
couldn't
be
done.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
your
honor
we
were
working
on
it
when
we
had
to
drop
that
and
file
a
response
to
the
motion
for
vacating
the
stay,
and
we
have
simply
not
had
time
to
pursue
that.
it
was
our
intention
to
proceed
with
that
as
promptly
as
we
could.
we
announced
that
we
wanted
to
do
it
within
a
ten-day
period
if
that
were
possible.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir.
that's
one
other
point
i
wanted
to
emphasize
and
clear
up.
after
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioners
then
filed
for
immediately
sending
down
the
mandate,
either
in
the
next
mail
or
certainly
by
the
next
day.
we
were
preparing
at
the
same
time
the
other
side
was
to
present
our
motion
for
a
stay.
i
think
it's
correct
that
the
petitioner's
motion
arrived
there
one
day,
ours
arrived
the
next,
so
the
issue
there
was
traversed.
in
other
words
each
position
was
opposed
to
the
other,
them
asking
for
immediate
sending
down
of
the
mandate
and
our
asking
for
the
stay
for
a
customary
period
of
time
and
it
is
my
information
that
the
entire
court,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
granted
that
stay,
that
it
was
not
done
just
by
the
chief
judge
or
any
justice
there
of.
it's
my
information
that
every
justice
agreed
to
the
stay
after
the
respective
motions
had
been
filed
and
that
--
and
the
answer
was
the
decision
of
the
court
was
announced
the
day
after
--
the
later
of
the
two
motions
was
filed.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
and
filing
a
brief
with
it
depending
largely
of
course
upon
whether
this
court
weights
rules
of
printing
records.
there
has
been
no
printed
record
in
this.
actually
it
has
moved
so
fast
and
courts
have
ordered
us
to
do
things
both
sides
so
quickly
that
there
has
been
no
time
to
print
much
of
the
thing
that's
customary
to
print.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
would
do
it
as
quickly
as
we
could
which
we
had
planned
to
do
anyway
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
no
disposition
to
delay
legal
proceedings,
but
we
hope
that
we
will
be
given
time
in
that
event
as
we
should,
to
do
it
in
an
orderly
fashion
and
get
all
of
the
things
before
--
all
of
the
points
before
this
court
that
should
be
presented.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
has
been
my
limited
experience,
that
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
present
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
there
are
certain
things
that
must
be
done
and
we
are
not
as
familiar
with
that
as
lawyers
who
practice
here
in
washington.
we
would
deplore
being
rushed
into
it
to
the
extent
of
not
being
--
having
time
adequately
to
prepare.
now
it
seems
that
all
the
lawyers
in
this
case
are
--
pretty
well
agreed
and
we
won't
dwell
on
that
part
of
it,
that
this
court
probably
has
the
power
to
grant
petitioners'
motion.
many
instances
can
be
cited
both
ways,
not
only
of
this
court
but
all
appellate
courts,
of
setting
aside
or
upholding.
the
customary
thing
of
course
is
for
the
court
that
heard
the
case
to
exercise
its
judicial
discretion
in
granting
the
stay
or
not.
now
it
would
be
in
our
opinion
an
unusual
procedure,
although
not
unprecedented
for
this
court
to
vacate
the
stay
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
it
would
serve
any
useful
purpose
to
dwell
on
the
various
cases
in
the
various
circuits
as
well
as
in
this
court.
i
think
we're
all
in
accord
that
there
is
power
in
this
court
to
do
either
one.
now
unquestionably
though
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioners
that
is
at
least
my
studied
judgment.
i
think
the
very
nature
of
the
legal
proceedings
dictate
that
when
a
stay
is
granted
by
a
court
the
burden
is
on
the
side
seeking
to
set
that
aside,
and
we
feel
that
they
have
not
met
any
such
burden
up
to
this
point.
as
we
see
it
each
such
case
presents
itself
to
every
court,
whether
it's
this
court
or
any
other
appellate
court,
with
this
rather
simple
but
profound
question,
and
that
is
should
we
as
a
court
on
motion
pending
on
appeal
or
certiorari,
summarily
substitute
our
opinion
for
that
of
the
lower
court
which
heard
the
case
and
granted
the
stay.
with
this
court
sitting
en
banc,
it
may
prove
difficult
for
all
the
parties
to
eliminate
arguing
judge
lemley's
decision
as
against
the
point
that
is
before
this
court
right
now,
the
particular
issue
of
setting
aside
the
stay
of
the
eighth
circuit.
and
i
agree
with
counsel
that
he's
just
spoken
that
such
argument
necessarily
overlaps
one
into
the
other.
it's
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
however,
we
feel
that
even
though
such
arguments
become
intertwined,
that
really
the
case,
the
issue
before
this
court
as
of
now,
insofar
as
these
pleadings
are
concerned,
is
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
set
aside
the
stay
of
the
eighth
circuit.
now
i
set
forth
in
our
response,
the
trial
court
after
hearing
evidence
for
three
days
found
that
under
the
conditions
now
existing
in
little
rock
and
these
findings,
not
a
single
finding
of
judge
lemley
was
disturbed
or
questioned
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
everyone
of
those
itself
and
so
set
them
out
in
the
opinion.
but
judge
lemley
found
and
also
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
school
board
of
little
rock
to
operate
a
school
program
for
the
2,000
students
at
central
high
school
on
an
integrated
basis
at
this
time,
and
that
unless
the
plan
of
desegregation
is
postponed
for
a
reasonable
length
of
time,
that
irreparable
harm
will
be
inflicted
upon
the
students
of
both
negro
and
white
race.
now
the
broad
issue
of
course
in
this
case
is
simply
this.
can
a
court
of
equity
postpone
the
enforcement
of
the
plaintiffs'
constitutional
rights
if
the
immediate
enforcement
thereof
will
deprive
others,
many
others
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
their
constitutional
rights
to
an
education
in
a
free
public
school?
the
little
rock
public
school
board
is
composed
of
outstanding
citizens
of
our
community.
there
are
two
medical
doctors
on
the
board.
there
is
a
civil
engineer,
graduate
civil
engineer,
one
of
the
large
manufacturing
concerns
in
our
state.
there
is
a
certified
public
accountant.
there
is
a
leading
businessman
of
one
of
the
large
backing
companies
there,
an
official
of
that
company,
and
the
present
president
of
the
little
rock
school
board
is
a
wise
and
experienced
lawyer
who
has
practiced
there
many
years.
those
men
are
unpaid.
they
are
public
servants.
they
have
tried
to
do
the
best
they
could
under
as
trying
circumstances
as
any
public
servants
have
ever
been
faced
with.
now
when
other
boards
of
education
were
refusing
to
recognize
the
basic
change
that
the
supreme
court
had
made
in
the
law
in
the
brown
decision,
this
board
was
studying
and
formulating
ways
and
means
of
complying.
they
knew
it
was
not
an
easy
task,
but
they
were
willing
to
do
their
best.
these
are
men
of
high
standing
as
i
have
said
in
their
community.
from
bitter
experience,
however,
they
discovered
that
they
could
not
operate
a
public
school
system
under
the
existing
climate
in
little
rock
as
of
this
time.
now
they
didn't
anticipate
all
of
the
difficulty
that
has
arisen
and
i
dare
say
that
many
courts
did
not
anticipate
all
of
that
difficulty.
but
from
bitter
experience
they
discovered
after
some
five
or
six
months
of
operation,
after
troops
had
been
in
and
out
and
still
there,
under
different
commanders
that
they
could
operate
the
school
only
with
troops
and
yet
they
could
not
give
an
education
with
troops.
they
came
to
that,
studied
and
serious
conclusion
on
or
about
the
later
part
of
or
about
the
20th
of
february
after
they
have
been
operating
a
full
completely
semester
with
troops
in
the
halls
and
around
the
school
building.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
the
school
board
did
not
ask
for
troops,
no
sir.
this
was
not
an
impulsive
search
for
relief
from
the
courts
that
these
men
made,
but
after
they
had
tried
it
for
a
long
time.
now
many
people
in
little
rock
and
through
out
the
line
no
doubt
are
sympathetic
and
try
to
be
understanding
of
the
school
board's
problem,
but
no
one
can
put
themselves
in
the
place
of
this
school
board
unless
they
have
been
there.
we
find
that
even
the
press
in
many
places,
not
just
in
the
south
land,
has
been
understanding
and
as
an
example
of
that
i
would
like
to
read
a
very
brief
editorial
from
the
new
york
paper
as
late
as
august
20th.
it
says
among
many
trials
of
the
people
of
little
rock
certainly
not
the
least
of
them
has
been
the
way
in
the
which
the
course
of
events
has
been
suddenly
reversed
and
reversed
again
by
the
various
agencies
of
government
and
now
they
are
to
suffer
more
of
it.
first
there
was
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
that
upset
the
old
order
in
the
school.
to
this
change
the
local
authorities
in
little
rock
and
most
of
its
people
tried
to
adjust,
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
were
confronted
with
troops
sent
by
their
governor
to
block
integration
and
troops
sent
by
their
president
to
enforce
integration.
next
there
was
a
ruling
by
a
federal
district
judge
denying
a
stay
and
ordering
integration.
this
was
followed
by
an
order
from
another
federal
judge
in
the
same
district
granting
the
people
at
times
respite
by
postponing
integration.
this
week
the
federal
circuit
judge
has
once
more
reversed
direction.
there
is
talk
of
another
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
a
special
session
of
the
legislature,
all
of
which
of
course
has
come
about
in
the
last
few
days.
this
surely
is
a
terrible
buffeting
of
one
people
by
the
laws
and
powers
of
office.
each
of
these
office
holders
may
have
had
the
right
to
act
as
he
did.
but
just
the
same
the
result
has
been
that
the
people
of
little
rock
did
not
know
from
one
day
unto
the
next,
under
what
order
of
society
they
must
live,
but
found
all
change
by
which
holder
of
what
office
wielded
the
moments
power.
we
cannot
know
what
will
happen
next
month
in
the
schools
of
little
rock.
it
maybe
too
late
now
for
the
whole
that
somehow
time
and
forbearance
will
be
allowed
to
heal
passions.
and
yet
it
must
be
hope
for
any
man
can
see
what
will
happen
if
the
issue
of
integration
comes
to
devour
the
issue
of
education.
what
kind
of
education
can
we
give
any
children,
white
or
negro,
in
classrooms
inflamed
by
animosities
or
if
once
more
it
comes
to
that
echoing
the
triumph
of
soldiers.
that
ends
the
editorial.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
is
the
wall
street
journal
of
august
20,
1958.
now
the
supreme
court
said
that
local
courts
should
be
the
ones
to
decide
the
various
questions
which
would
arise,
it
may
seem
unnecessary
and
perhaps
unduly
academic
to
read
to
this
court,
maybe
even
seem
presumptuous
to
read
to
this
court
what
it
has
said,
but
i
have
gotten
something
out
of
the
opinion
every
time
i
have
read
it
and
reread
it,
and
reread
it.
and
apparently
experienced
judges
give
different
ideas
about
what
this
court
means.
and
perhaps
even
at
the
expense
of
reputation
it
is
advisable
to
read
portions
of
that
opinion
in
the
light
of
the
events
which
have
taken
place
in
little
rock.
this
case
--
this
court
said
in
the
brown
case
that
because
these
cases
arose
under
different
local
conditions
and
their
disposition
will
involve
a
variety
of
local
problems,
we
requested
further
argument
on
the
question
of
relief.
these
presentations
were
informative
and
helpful
and
in
its
consideration
of
the
complexities
arising
from
the
transition
to
a
system
public
--
of
public
education
free
of
racial
discrimination,
full
implementation
of
these
constitutional
principles
may
require
solution
of
varied
local
school
problems,
because
of
their
proximity
to
local
conditions
and
the
need
for
further
hearings
the
courts
which
originally
heard
these
cases
can
best
perform
this
judicial
appraisal.
accordingly,
we
believe
it's
appropriate
to
remand
those
cases
to
those
courts.
in
fashioning
and
effectuating
the
decrees
the
courts
will
be
guided
by
equitable
principles.
traditionally
equity
has
been
characterized
by
a
practical
flexibility
in
shaping
its
remedies
and
by
a
facility
for
adjusting
and
reconciling
public
and
private
needs.
these
cases
call
for
the
exercise
of
these
traditional
attributes
of
equity
power.
by
giving
weight
to
these
public
and
private
considerations,
the
courts
will
require
that
the
defendants
make
a
prompt
and
reasonable
start
towards
the
compliance
with
our
may
17th
1954
ruling.
once
such
a
start
has
been
made
the
courts
may
find
that
additional
time
is
necessary
to
carry
out
the
ruling
in
an
effective
manner.
when
we
look
at
this
entire
problem,
we
recognize
that
two-and-a-half
years,
historically
is
a
very
short
time
or
perhaps
any
other
period
of
time
and
i
know
of
no
better
way
at
least
it
was
most
impressive
on
judge
lemley.
it
was
impressive
on
other
people
when
mr.
blossom,
the
school
board
superintendent,
who
has
studied
this
thing
and
has
been
on
his
heart
as
well
as
the
hearts
of
the
school
board
members
more
than
anyone
else
and
has
been
his
major
responsibility
in
asking
him
in
the
lower
court
what
he
found,
and
this
is
in
the
record
that
is
now
before
your
honors.
he
was
asked
the
question
whether
he
had
read
the
supreme
court
decision,
these
men
were
earnestly
trying
to
carry
out
the
orders
of
the
federal
court
as
they
saw
it.
but
their
function
was
also
to
maintain
a
public
education
system
in
little
rock,
and
i
will
say
i
think
in
all
fairness
to
those
men
that
that
probably
was
their
primary
object
and
consideration
and
duty.
but
mr.
blossom
testified
in
studying
this
problem
just
what
did
it
mean,
what
did
deliberate
speed
mean
in
one
locality
as
against
another,
what
did
it
mean
in
this
particular
serious
problem
that
has
confronted
not
just
little
rock
but
the
entire
nation
and
here
in
substance
was
his
testimony
that
portion
of
it
verbatim.
we
ask
him
whether
he
had
given
consideration
to
this
time
element
when
they
finally
filed
the
petition
before
judge
lemley
for
a
two-and-a-half
year
delay
and
he
said
very
definitely,
we
have
given
great
consideration
to
it
in
this
plan.
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
very
important
and
very
dear
to
the
hearts
of
many
people
on
both
sides
of
it.
we
took
into
account
the
effect
as
far
as
time
and
other
cultural
pattern
changes
in
our
society
were
concerned.
we
try
to
look
into
history
to
see
what
it
would
teach
us.
we
tried
to
analyze
the
situation
of
the
negro
and
his
march
to
civil
rights
in
this
community.
then
he
was
asked
the
question
as
whether
he
considered
the
term
delivery
speeds.
his
answer
was,
“yes
sir,
very
material.”
the
negro
race
as
a
race
came
to
this
country
in
1619.
they
came
in
chains
as
slaves.
they
stayed
in
that
and
as
far
as
i
could
study
it,
you
would
class
that
as
the
first
period
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
and
they
stayed
from
1619
until
1865,
nearly
two-and-three-quarter
century
and
that
is
one
period
in
their
march
for
civil
rights
and
their
development.
the
second
period
came
in
1865
and
they
stayed
in
this
second
period
until
1896,
the
decision
of
plessy
versus
ferguson.
that
is
31
years.
now
in
this
period
they
had
their
freedom,
they
did
not
have
the
economic
or
political
or
any
other
type
of
positions
to
any
extent.
then
coming
out
of
that
period
into
what
i
could
call
the
third
one
from
1896
to
1954
and
i
would
just
label
that
separate
but
equal.
now
they
stayed
in
that
58
years
and
then
you
look
at
the
problem
and
the
complexities
in
this
thing
and
recognize
that
many
separate
but
equally
--
is
in
no
way
a
reality.
in
many
places
in
the
south
land,
but
in
little
rock
arkansas
they
were.
“i
am
not
arguing
the
separate
but
equal
philosophy,”
mr.
blossom
continued,
“i
am
trying
to
state
that
history
tells
us
in
terms
of
two-and-a-half
year
request
for
delay
that
this
is
the
third
period
and
we
account
for
the
fact
that
there
are
three
periods,
one
taking
nearly
three
centuries,
another
31
years
and
another
58
years
and
recognizing
that
there
is
one
group
that
says
we
are
going
to
have
it
all
now
and
another
that
says
we
are
never
going
to
have
it,
you
put
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
in
the
proper
perspective
with
the
school
board
right
in
the
middle
and
it
is
a
difficult
thing.
and
then
you
come
to
may
17
1954
and
we
look
at
it
today
that
was
june
4,
'58
and
you
compare
that
period
of
time
as
compared
to
either
of
the
three
previous
periods
i
have
outlined
and
you
wonder
how
fast
in
terms
of
history,
can
anyone
expect
a
change
in
cultural
pattern.”
following
that
mr.
blossom
went
into
some
detail
and
as
did
the
president
of
the
school
board
as
to
what
could
be
done
in
two-and-a-half
years
and
that
is
in
the
record
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
implication
left
by
opposing
counsel
that
nothing
was
to
be
done.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i'd
like
to
start,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
his
testimony
in
effect
was
this
and
i'd
be
glad
to
read
it
to
you
on
your
honor,
but
it
is
rather
interspersed
as
well
as
mr.
upton's
in
among
a
whole
lot
of
other
testimony.
it
basically
is
simply
this
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
they
felt
that
starting
at
mid-semester
after
organization
was
completed
during
the
first
semester
was
wise.
that
would
put
it
at
the
middle
of
a
term.
their
reasoning
simply
was
this,
that
your
pta
organizations
perhaps
other
organizations
were
and
the
school
itself
was
then
in
a
better
organized
position
than
it
was
after
a
summer
recess
of
three
months.
the
other
thing
was
simply
this
and
we
are
firmly
convinced
of
this
situation.
in
little
rock
as
well
as
throughout
the
south
and
in
other
places
where
problem
has
arisen,
the
great
mass
of
people
are
not
law
violators
as
such.
they
are
not
people
who
form
mobs,
they
are
not
people
who
defy
the
law,
but
we
submit
in
this
school
board
determined
that
they
were
entitled
to
know
what
the
law
was
and
as
long
as
editorialist,
popular
editorialist
in
our
community
were
saying
that
this
was
not
the
law
of
the
land
and
if
there
were
ways
to
get
around
it
and
one
court
was
saying
one
thing
and
another
court
was
saying
another,
and
there
were
laws
on
the
state
statute
books
of
arkansas
as
well
as
other
states
throughout
the
south,
diametrically
opposed
as
some
people
argued,
some
of
them
could
be
reconciled,
some
of
them
could
not
with
the
decision
in
the
brown
case,
but
it
left
the
people
of
our
community
as
well
as
the
people
of
many
communities
in
actual
doubt
as
to
what
the
law
was
and
on
question
to
the
people
in
our
part
of
the
country,
wanted
to
believe
that
this
thing
could
take
a
long
time
or
be
circumvented
entirely.
they
wanted
to
believe
that,
but
it
is
our
firm
opinion
and
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
school
board
and
that
was
the
main
consideration
given
when
they
finally
decided
on
a
two-and-a-half
year
request
that
in
that
period
of
time
perhaps
as
we
pointed
in
our
response
a
national
policy
could
definitely
be
established,
that
laws
could
be
tested
so
that
the
people
would
know,
the
people
who
want
to
obey
the
final
word.
now
that
was
the
reason
and
very
candidly
mr.
blossom
ended
up
by
testifying
and
i
am
sure
this
was
the
thinking
of
every
member
of
the
school
board
as
well
that
we
don't
know
that
two-and-a-half
years
will
do
it.
you
may
be
able
to
do
it
one
year,
you
might
do
it
in
a
year-and-a-half,
maybe
two-and-a-half
is
not
enough.
he
doesn't
know
but
the
courts
have
said
that
the
first
consideration
of
this
problem
shall
be
dealt
with
by
the
school
boards,
it
is
their
primary
function,
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court
i
believe
have
said
it
just
that
way,
if
not
certainly
all
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
your
honor
in
answer
to
that
i
simply
say
this,
that
it
was
certainly
not
anticipated
at
the
time
that
plan
was
formulated
that
the
governor
of
the
state
of
arkansas
would
call
our
troops
to
keep
integration
in
the
schools
from
taking
place,
nor
was
it
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
your
honor
this
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
this
school
board
is
simply
faced
with
realities,
and
that
is
the
possession
that
it's
in.
it
did
not
anticipate
the
extreme
difficulties
that
it
went
into.
it
knew
that
it
did
not
have
an
easy
task
in
this
thing.
all
school
boards
i
think
realize
that.
they
did
not
anticipate
the
events
which
actually
did
take
place,
neither
did
they
anticipate
the
things
which
are
right
today
destroying
the
public
schools
system
there.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
your
honor,
i
think
the
only
answer
to
that
is
that
many
districts
do
not
have
that
problem,
even
in
some
parts
of
the
south.
in
our
state
university,
negro
students
have
been
there
for
some
years,
and
there
has
been
no
great
problem
about
it.
our
other
districts
where
the
problems
are
greater
as
this
court
pointed
out
that
you
have
a
variety
of
local
problems.
now
in
arkansas
there
are
some
--
a
number
of
districts,
as
well
as
in
texas
and
other
states,
where
the
people
of
that
community
have
done
it
largely
for
economic
reasons,
various
other
reasons,
but
in
any
event
it
has
worked
successfully.
and
i
simply
say
again
that
this
school
board
in
little
rock,
arkansas
was
not
faced
with
theories,
it
was
faced
with
actualities
which
are
undermining
and
which
are
going
to
destroy
the
public
school
system
in
little
rock
and
when
its
destroyed
it
will
be
destroyed
not
just
for
white
students,
it
will
be
destroyed
all
the
way
up
and
down
the
line
unless
they're
given
an
opportunity
to
work
this
thing
out
in
a
climate
of
calm
rather
than
in
a
climate
of
hysteria.
now
we
urgently
feel
that
way
and
the
school
board
feels
that
way
about
it.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
understand
that
and
of
course
your
honor
is
correct,
if
the
word
i
think
non
acceptance
or
some
such
or
opposition.
now,
the
courts
have
certainly
held
and
we
find
no
fault
with
the
basic
statement,
the
bald
statement,
the
just
mental
reservations
about
this,
or
mental
opposition
to
it,
but
when
a
school
board
is
confronted
with
facts
which
of
themselves
will
force
it,
will
force
the
destruction
of
the
public
school
system,
then
this
board
feels
and
judge
lamley
felt
that
time
should
be
given
for
cooler
heads,
calmer
atmosphere
to
come
to
the
front
in
order
to
work
out
these
problems
or
at
least
to
give
an
atmosphere
that
is
conducive
to
working
those
out.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
so,
but
not
directed
to
the
people
who
form
mobs,
not
directed
to
the
people
who
are
law
deifiers,
we're
not
standing
up
here
taking
--
trying
to
argue
for
their
side
of
it.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
are
arguing
for
the
great
mass
of
people
throughout
the
south
who
i
say
again
and
will
say
again
and
again,
are
not
law
deifiers.
they
want
to
follow
the
law
but
they
as
of
this
moment
without
certain
state
statutes
having
been
tested
in
court
do
not
know
just
exactly
what
the
law
is
in
a
particular
given
circumstance.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
both,
i
would
say
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir.
i
don't
feel
that
way
about
it.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
but
there
are
certain
laws
such
as
pupil
assignment
laws
and
laws
of
that
kind
and
incidentally
the
pupil
assignment
law
has
just
been
recently
upheld
by
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
alabama,
i
believe
it
was
in
may
of
this
year,
its
reported
in
the
june
race
relations
report,
and
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
that.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
i
think
--
well
not
specifically
here,
i
think
it's
intertwined
in
this
entire
problem.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
the
pupil
assignment
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
is
not
--
that
statute
as
such
is
not
before
this
court
at
that
time
no
sir,
the
point
i'm
making
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
laws
such
as
that,
i
use
that
as
an
illustration,
laws
such
as
that
are
being
advanced.
some
of
them
have
been
on
the
books
for
many
years.
some
of
them
have
--
many
of
them
have
not
been
determined
whether
their
constitutional
or
not,
and
the
great
mass
of
people
are
in
our
opinion
entitled
to
know
and
have
those
laws
tested
in
court.
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir
i
would
say
that
has
been
decided
mr.
justice
black
and
arkansas
statute
does
not
contain
any
such
provision,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
contains
directly
the
contrary,
but
it
does
set
out
some
other
things
which
school
boards
generally
have
taken
into
consideration
throughout
the
year,
such
as
psychological
adjustment,
various
other
things,
health
and
many
things.
now,
some
of
the
school
assignment
law,
pupil
assignment
laws,
i
understand
have
been
held
by
federal
courts
to
be
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
the
most
recent
one
with
which
i
am
familiar
with,
and
to
which
i
refer,
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
alabama;
held
at
that,
that
state
law
was
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
they
upheld
it.
i
don't
know
just
where
it
is
now
but
it's
--
it
was
upheld
by
a
three-judge
federal
court.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
the
arkansas
--
yes
sir
the
arkansas
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
it
was
passed
in
1957,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
1955
or
1957,
mr.
richard
c.
butler
on
the
basis
of
race,
yes
sir,
but
it
sets
out
some
12
or
15
other
things
that
school
boards
may
consider.
now
admittedly
of
course
courts
cannot
make
decision
based
on
popularity
polls,
but
the
fact
is
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
in
passing
that
a
respected
poll
taken
very
recently
across
this
entire
nation
shows,
and
it
was
not
taken
just
in
the
south,
it
was
throughout
the
entire
united
states,
that
54%
of
the
people
favored
judge
lemley's
decision
and
felt
that
it
was
the
only
way
to
solve
this
particular
problem.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
now
to
show
the
seriousness
of
this
problem
your
honors,
your
chief
judge,
judge
gardner
wrote
this
short
dissent,
and
to
me
it
is
so
appropriate,
so
realistic,
so
proper
under
the
decision,
the
words
themselves
of
the
brown
decision
that
i'd
like
to
read
at
least
parts
of
it.
it's
the
entire
dissent
is
limited
to
one
page,
but
he
says
it
is
conceded
that
the
school
authorities
have
acted
in
good
faith,
both
in
formulating
a
plan
or
integrating
and
in
attempting
to
implement
the
plan.
their
efforts
in
this
regard
were
met
with
unprecedented
and
unforeseen
opposition
and
resistance
as
set
out
and
enumerated
in
the
majority
opinion.
this
opposition
included
acts
of
violence
to
such
an
unprecedented
extent
that
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
were
stationed
in
about
the
school
building.
the
events
pertinent
to
the
attempts
of
the
school
authorities
during
the
school
year
to
implement
its
plan
for
integration
are
set
forth
in
the
majority
opinion.
the
normal
conduct
of
the
school
was
continuously
disrupted
and
the
state
of
mind
both
within
and
without
the
school
was
to
a
greater
or
a
lesser
extent
in
a
state
of
hysteria.
under
such
circumstances
and
conditions
set
out
in
judge
lemley's
opinion,
the
school
authorities
made
application
for
an
extension
of
time
so
as
to
permit
a
cooling
off
or
breathing
space,
so
that
both
pupils,
parents,
teachers
and
the
public
might
to
some
extent
become
reconciled
to
the
inevitable
necessity
for
public
school
integration.
having
in
mind
that
the
school
officials
and
the
teaching
staff
acted
in
good
faith
and
if
the
school
officials
presented
their
petition
for
an
extension
of
time
in
good
faith
it
was
the
duty
of
this
court
and
he
quotes,
“to
consider
whether
the
action
of
school
authorities
constitutes
good
faith
implementation
of
the
governing
constitutional
principle”
and
he
cites
the
brown
case
of
course.
in
this
situation
the
action
of
judge
lemley
in
extending
the
time
as
requested
by
the
school
official
was
the
exercise
of
his
judicial
discretion.
the
background
is
well
set
forth
in
judge
lemley's
opinion.
for
centuries
there
had
been
no
intermittent
social
relations
between
white
and
colored
races
in
the
section
referred
to
as
the
south.
there
had
been
no
integration
in
the
schools
and
that
practice
had
the
sanction
and
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
as
constitutionally
legal.
it
had
become
a
way
of
life
in
that
section
of
the
country
and
it
is
not
strange
that
this
long
established,
cherished
practice
could
not
suddenly
be
changed
without
resistance.
such
changes,
if
successful,
are
usually
accomplished
by
evolution
rather
than
revolution
and
time,
patience,
forbearance
are
important
elements
in
effecting
all
radical
changes.
the
action
of
judge
lemley
was
based
on
realities
and
on
conditions
rather
than
theories.
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
should
not,
i
think,
be
set
aside
as
it
seems
to
me
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
rather
a
discretion
wisely
exercised
under
all
the
conditions.
we
should
not
substitute
our
judgment
for
that
of
the
trial
court.
that
ends
judge
gardner's
decision.
all
we
are
asking
at
this
moment
is
for
this
court
to
continue
in
effect
the
stay
of
the
circuit
court
until
our
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
can
be
filed
and
considered
and
the
matter
heard
in
an
orderly
fashion.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
would
probably
be
somewhat
longer
your
honor
but
that
would
be
the
basis
of
it.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
think
in
the
short
space
that
judge
gardner
took
i
think
he
said
it
about
as
concisely
as
it
could
be
said.
i
think
there
are
other
things
to
be
said
in
connection
with
it.
he
practiced
his
dissent,
that
under
the
time
element
he
could
not
go
into
in
great
detail,
but
that
it
was
a
hurried
opinion
but
his
firm
opinion.
but
we
are
here
now
for
that
purpose
and
as
i
understand
it
for
that
purpose
alone,
to
ask
that
the
normal
procedure
be
followed
in
this
important
case
and
that
this
court
not
disturb
the
stay
of
the
eighth
circuit
under
the
present
circumstances.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
your
honor
of
course
our
position
is
simply
this,
that
judge
lemley's
decision
although
found
to
be
in
disagreement
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
nevertheless
both
obviously
he
and
then
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
should
be
stayed,
which
is
an
indication
to
us
your
honor
and
to
many
other
judges
and
lawyers
throughout
this
land,
that
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
some
question
in
its
mind.
if
it
was
absolutely
certain
that
it
had
been
correct,
the
chances
are
it
would
not
have
issued
the
stay.
it
was
in
his
--
it
was
within
its
power
to
deny
a
stay.
they
were
traversed
and
they
had
it
before
them
and
they
had
heard
the
whole
case.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
it
is
and
it
is
the
customary
procedure
if
your
honor
please
for
this
court
to
recognize
the
judicial
discretion
of
that
court
in
granting
stays
and
ordinarily
i
would
say
does
not
upset
them.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
and
i
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
i
think,
your
honor
that
is
so
wrapped
up
legally
and
practically
that
the
practical
effect
of
that,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
would
be
that
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
for
what
we
are
ultimately
seeking
and
that
is
to
give
the
people
of
that
section
an
opportunity
to
think
in
a
period
of
calm
rather
than
in
a
period
of
hysteria.
now
if
the
court
puts
it
back
in
the
status
quo
that
it
was
before
judge
lemley
it
would
serve
this
school
board
as
we
see
it
no
usual
purpose.
there
would
be
troops
back
in
little
rock
to
maintain
law
and
order
and
–
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
perhaps
should
not
because
that
is
my
personal
opinion.
i'm
expressing
the
opinion
of
the
school
board
in
its
considered
judgment
the
school
board
feels
that
that
is
what
would
happen
and
they
have
been
in
this
untamable
position.
they
cannot
operate
a
school
without
students
apparently
and
they
cannot
have
an
educational
system
and
program
with
them.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
presume
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
have
asked
for
a
rebuttal
time,
we
have
completed
this
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
right.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
oh
at
this
time
to
mr.
martin.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
thank
you,
your
honor.
counsel
for
n.a.a.c.p.
has
made
this
statement
that
we
have
to
weigh,
the
court
has
to
weigh,
as
it
said
in
its
lower
--
in
the
brown
decision,
previous
decision,
the
irreparable
harm
on
the
one
side
as
against
on
the
other
side.
now,
here
are
the
facts,
the
record
points
it
out.
i
don't
think
anyone
will
dispute
it.
here
we
have
2000
students
in
one
of
the
high
schools
and
we
have
hundred
of
others
in
the
other
high
schools.
these
petitioners,
although
it's
a
class
action
of
course,
designated
as
such
by
the
original
plaintiffs.
but
there
are
only
seven
who
would
not
be
deprived
of
anything
tangible
or
any
benefit
that
you
can
really
point
to
of,
anything
like
a
tangible
--
in
a
tangible
measurement.
now,
as
against
that,
if
the
public
school
system
is
at
steak
in
little
rock
and
this
school
board
earnestly
believes
that
it
is.
then
you
are
effecting
from
an
equitable
standpoint,
maybe
not
just
the
remaining
2000
students
in
central
high
school
but
perhaps
throughout
the
school
system
in
little
rock.
now,
those
are
the
balancing
of
the
equities
that,
it
seems
to
us,
weigh
heavily
in
favor
of
denying
the
vacating
of
this
stay
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
have
tried
as
i
said
at
the
very
beginning
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
and
their
--
and
their
actual
ability
to
get
any
kind
of
an
education
there
in
a
public
school
system
are
wrapped
up
in
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
our
opinion.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
--
and
we
feel
that
--
that
unless
we
are
granted
this
stay
that
the
whole
thing
might
be
in
a
flood
and
be
washed
down
stream
where
no
one
benefits.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
then,
of
course,
it
would
be
an
empty
victory
indeed
for
the
negro
students.
now,
on
that
one
point
though,
i
think,
theoretically
at
least
opposing
counsel
and
i
can
agree
and
that
is
that
the
balancing
of
these
equities
must
be
done,
the
irreparable
harm
that
would
be
done
to
the
students
just
in
central
high
school.
if
they
have
to
go
to
school
with
troops
marching
up
and
down
the
hall.
now,
as
i
start
it
out
at
the
beginning,
we
don't
--
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
argue
the
case
in
chief.
i
have
attempted
to
refrain
from
arguing
it.
we
believe
that
there
are
many
decisions
which
we
should
study
and
submit
to
this
court
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
we
have
attempted
to
limit
our
argument
on
the
pleadings
that
are
now
before
this
court,
but
it
is
difficult,
of
course,
to
stay
on
that
one
limited
issue
when,
of
course,
everyone
is
concerned
about
the
entire
issue,
as
it
is
shown
in
the
entire
case.
now,
one
other
point
and
perhaps
i
did
not
emphasize
this
enough.
regardless,
of
whether
or
not
the
people
of
arkansas
should
recognize
the
united
states
supreme
court
decisions
as
the
law
of
the
land.
the
plain
fact
is
that
they
have
not
and
it
is
most
difficult
for
them
to
do
so,
if
not
impossible
when
the
governor
of
the
state
says,
that
that
is
not
the
law
of
the
land
then
only
congress
can
really
say
what
the
law
of
the
land
is.
now,
as
lawyers
we
may
take
the
position.
well,
they're
not
informed
but
that
is
a
fact
and
as
long
as
the
united
states
senator
from
a
neighboring
state
of
ours
says,
it's
not
the
law
of
the
land
and
as
long
as
our
governor
says,
that
it
is
not
the
law
of
the
land,
not
the
set
of
law
of
the
land.
mr.
chief
justice,
you've
been
the
governor
of
a
great
state
and
if
you
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
all
realize
that,
sir.
the
point
i'm
making
is
this.
that
if
the
governor
of
any
state
says,
that
a
united
state
supreme
court
decision
is
not
the
law
of
the
land,
the
people
of
that
state
until
it
is
really
resolved
have
a
doubt
in
their
mind
and
a
right
to
have
a
doubt.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i'm
not
advocating
that
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
--
i
trust
that
these
words
will
be
weighed
carefully.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
mass
of
people
in
a
state
wanting
to
believe
a
certain
thing,
if
they
are
told
by
their
chief
executive
that
such
and
such
is
the
law
or
is
not
the
law,
then
if
he
is
a
popular
and
respected
public
official,
they
are
inclined
to
believe
him
and
what
they
want
to
hear.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
nevertheless,
that
is
a
fact
and
not
a
theory
in
little
rock
and
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
--
and
--
that
is
a
fact
and
not
a
theory
in
many
other
localities
other
than
in
arkansas,
many
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
your
honor
we've
gotten
into
a
whole
lot
of
things
that
maybe
or
not
strictly
directed
towards
the
pleadings
that
are
here
before
us,
but
we
feel
so
earnestly
about
this.
we
feel
that
many
people,
judges,
lawyers,
various
others
have
taken
exactly
opposite
stands
throughout
this
land.
and
it
is
my
personal
opinion
and
it's
the
opinion
of
many
others,
not
just
others
that
the
people
by
and
large
and
even
judges
and
lawyers
are
not
certain
as
to
what
deliberate
speed
means
under
certain
circumstances.
they're
not
certain
about
what
equitable
principle
should
be
applied
and
when.
they
are
not
certain
about
laws
that
have
not
yet
been
tested
for
their
constitutionality.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we're
asking
for
a
period
for
orderly
manner
of
process,
your
honor
and
we
think
that
the
orderly
processes
should
dictate
the
stay
of
the
circuit
court
being
in
effect
until
we
have
gotten
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
filed
and
if
it's
granted
that
we
be
allowed
to
present
briefs
and
arguments
on.
that
is
as
simply
as
i
can
state
our
position.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
--
that's
in
our
pleading.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
if
the
court
please.
we
likewise
do
not
ought
to
be
critical
of
the
attorney
general's
office
but
we
have
some
ideas
about
where
it
may
have
failed
in
a
few
instances.
in
the
honorable,
mr.
rankin's
summation,
he
says
in
one
part
of
the
argument
that
this
court
should
give
a
definitive
statement
and
then
he
argue
strongly
that
unquestionably,
the
writ
of
certiorari
would
be
denied.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
rather
inconsistent
position
to
take
because
if
the
writ
is
denied,
i
think,
customarily
at
least
just
two
words.
writ
denied,
come
out.
i
don't
see
how
a
definitive
action
on
the
part
of
this
court
or
a
definitive
decision,
an
opinion
could
be
rendered
under
those
circumstances
which
mr.
rankin
advocated.
now,
i
have
some
difficulty
in
following
just
exactly,
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking
in
this
thing.
i
don't
get
the
same
impression
from
a
very
hurried
reading.
it's
true.
we
only
receive
the
government's
brief
this
morning.
we've
only
had
a
time
to
scan
it
but
i
don't
quite
get
the
consistency
of
the
statements
in
the
brief
as
against
his
admission
that
everyone
has
conceded
that
the
little
rock
school
board
has
acted
in
good
faith.
now,
he
made
the
statement
that
there
should
be
good
faith.
the
courts
have
found
that
the
little
rock
school
board
in
all
instances
has
acted
in
good
faith.
it
has
found
many
other
things
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
finds
no
fault
with
judge
lemley's
findings.
among
which
is
that
this
school
board
cannot
operate
under
the
conditions
which
it
faces
as
of
this
time
unless
troops
are
stationed
in
the
building
and
outside
the
ground.
now,
he
states
that
it
is
time
to
come
in
and
ask
for
equitable
relief
when
all
has
been
done
within
the
power
of
the
school
board.
we
submit
that
this
record
throughout
and
everything
that
the
school
board
has
done
has
not
only
been
in
good
faith,
but
they
have
gone
to
the
point
to
try
to
carry
out
the
united
states
supreme
court
orders
and
the
orders
of
the
law
of
federal
courts,
to
the
extent
of
being
harassed
and
humiliated
among
their
own
people.
they
have
done
that
day-by-day.
they
were
faced
with
the
situation
in
september
of
1957,
as
we
pointed
out
earlier
of
troops
being
ordered
in
by
one
commander
and
then
troops
being
order
in
by
somebody
else.
and
those
troops
remain
and
in
spite
of
that,
the
little
rock
school
board
after
it
got
into
really
the
school
year
of
operating,
hoping
all
along
that
maybe
the
situation
would
resolve
itself,
therefore
troops
would
be
unnecessary.
they
went
clear
from
the
first
part
of
september,
clear
to
the
latter
part
of
february
before
going
into
the
court
of
equity
and
asking
for
relief.
we
submit
that
that
is
good
faith.
we
submit
that
they
were
entitled
to
equitable
relief
under
those
circumstancess.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
i
think
a
different
distinction
could
be
made
there,
your
honor,
i
do
indeed.
now,
the
fact
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
of
course,
it's
the
school
board
that
takes
the
brand
of
it
and
the
charge
is
that
the
school
board,
some
people
have
made
the
charges
and
i
understand
that
from
the
solicitor
general.
that
the
school
board
haven't
done
everything
that
it
should
have.
now,
the
fact
is,
the
realities
of
the
situation
are
that
the
n.a.a.c.p.
which
has
rather
vast
resources
and
certainly,
able
legal
counsel
had
a
perfect
right
to
come
in
and
ask
for
injunctive
relief
and
it
did
not
do
so.
the
justice
department
had
every
right
to
put
forward
any
criminal
actions
that
were
in
order
and
it
did
not
do
so.
and
now,
we
have
the
president
of
the
united
states
saying
that
the
process
should
go
slower
if
we
are
to
read
the
newspapers
accurately
and
if
the
newspapers
reported
it
accurately.
now,
that's
exactly
the
position
that
the
little
rock
school
board
is
taking.
we're
not
arguing
and
i
hope
the
court
does
not
misunderstand
this.
the
school
board
has
recognized
from
the
beginning
and
still
does.
first,
that
the
ultimate
decision
of
any
question
of
this
kind
is
a
question
of
law
and
that
the
final
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
must
stay.
we
have
never
argued
otherwise.
furthermore,
we
say
though
that
until
such
time
and
under
the
words
of
the
decision
itself,
we
should
be
given
ample
time
within
which
to
try
to
resolve
these
problems
in
--
in
an
atmosphere
of
calm
rather
than
of
his
theory.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
for
this
--
for
this
reason.
the
plan
itself
was
to
have
been
somewhat
flexible.
the
school
board
recognized
that
they
could
not
set
down
hard
and
fast
crew
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
they
fail
and
they
earnestly
fail,
that
they
could
be
upheld
in
showing
the
way,
you
might
say,
to
the
people
there
that
the
decision
of
the
united
state
supreme
court
had
to
be
carried
out
and
their
purpose
was
two
folds,
first,
to
maintain
a
public
school
system
and
second
to
carry
out
the
orders
of
the
federal
court
of
any
other
court
in
some
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
--
i
don't
know
what
was
in
the
thinking
of
each
school
board
member.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i'd
say,
educational
forces
or
processes,
if
you're
going
to
use
a
broad
term
because
the
school
board
was
faced
with
certain
realities.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
that's
a
difficult
thing
to
answer
because
i
say
again,
it's
so
intertwined.
they
don't
know
why
they
failed.
they
don't
know
exactly,
they
can't
point
to
any
one
thing.
they
know
this
though.
the
school
board
knows
that
they
were
faced
not
with
theories
but
with
realities
such
as
armed
troops
parading
the
hall
and
the
grounds
of
one
of
their
schools.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
now
that
to
me
then
to
answer
your
question
that
is
an
educational
factor
in
the
broad
sense.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
was
exactly
the
feeling
of
judge
lemley
and
judge
lemley
found
and
there
has
been
nothing
to
the
contrary
that
that
is
likely
what
will
happen
again.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no,
sir.
the
school
board
didn't
ask
for
them
but
there
were
times
there
when,
i
think,
i'm
correct
in
saying
that
they
were
glad
that
some
force
was
there
to
protect
order
and
keep
people
from
being
injured.
now
the
--
the
solicitor
general
tries
to
compare
hoxie,
arkansas
and
clinton,
tennessee.
there
is
absolutely
no
comparison
and
if
anyone
has
been
in
those
places,
you
can
readily
recognize
that
there
is
none.
in
the
first
place,
you
have
an
entirely
different
number
of
people
involved,
you
have
a
much
smaller
school,
you
have
a
school
board
in
that
place
--
in
both
of
those
places
dealing
directly
with
the
people
that
they
and
everyone
else
could
put
their
finger
on
as
interfering
with
it.
that
was
not
the
case
in
little
rock.
the
school
board
does
not
know
the
law
was
interfering
with
it.
and
for
counsel
to
say,
that
the
record
shows
that
there
were
only
25
students
involved.
that
is
not
an
accurate
statement
for
this
reason.
there
was
some
testimony
that
said
that
they
felt
there
might
have
been
as
many
as
25
ringleaders.
but
if
you
replace
those
25,
there
would
be
25
more
likely
and
the
fact
is
and
this,
of
course,
is
undisputed
that
there
were
200
students
that
this
school
board
suspended
because
they
walked
out
in
opposition
to
this.
now,
we
submit
that
the
record
shows
that
the
school
board
did
use
as
firm
measures
as
school
boards
ordinarily
can
and
should.
it
had
no
police
power,
it
had
no
troops.
it
had
no
closed
--
kind
of
plainclothesman.
it
had
no
on
like
that.
it
has
absolutely
no
duty
in
our
concept
of
the
law
to
go
out
and
preserve
the
public
peace.
that
is
not
its
function,
it
is
not
equipped
to
do
that,
and
i
think
there
can
be
no
successful
argument
that
there
ever
should
be.
the
school
board
should
be
equipped
to
maintain
peace
and
order
within
a
community.
now,
in
effect,
the
school
board
did
do
more
in
little
rock
to
try
to
work
this
thing
out
than
either
the
justice
department
or
the
petitioners
themselves.
we
say
again
and
we
emphasize,
that
we
do
not
criticize
them
anymore
than
they
criticize
us
for
failing
to
do
some
of
the
things
that
other
people
might
have
agreed
should
be
done,
or
people
would
argue
now
should
be
done
from
the
standpoint
of
hindsight
rather
than
foresight.
but
the
fact
is
that
no
one
in
the
government
brought
any
criminal
actions,
there
was
constant
consultation
between
the
two,
trying
to
work
out
problems
but
nothing
was
done.
the
school
board
did
not
advocate
if
they
do
anything,
they
didn't
advocate
because
they're
not
law
enforcement
officers.
they
were
trying
as
best
they
could
to
operate
the
school
system.
now,
we
point
out
again
that
the
school
board
was
left
on
the
hands
of
a
dilemma
and
the
fact
is,
and
it
is
never
been
disputed,
that
this
school
board
is
in
an
untenable
position.
and
all
we're
asking
--
all
we're
asking
at
this
time
is
for
time
to
try
to
do
those
things
and
work
out
these
problems
that
may
bring
peace
and
harmony
and
do
it
in
a
period
of
calm,
when
they
can
be
done
and
not
in
a
period
of
turmoil
and
strife.
even
in
cases
and
i
don't
want
to
argue
the
merits
of
this
thing
again
but
the
--
it's
--
it's
a
fact
that
even
in
cases
where
defendants
are
found
to
have
violated
antitrust
law.
and
in
those
cases
someone's
constitutional
rights
are
always
involved
or
their
legal
rights.as
much
as
five
years
or
more,
in
many
cases,
people
are
given
time
within
which
to
dispose
of
holding.
and
do
it
in
an
orderly
fashion.
that's
the
whole
purpose.
now,
shall
the
courts
deny
citizens
in
a
community,
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
reach
these
solutions
in
a
period
of
calm
and
quiet
rather
than
with
troops
present
and
in
an
atmosphere
of
strife
and
turmoil?
shall
the
courts
close
the
door
on
those
who
earnestly
and
conscientiously
plead
for
an
opportunity
to
seek
answers
in
a
climate
of
calm?
shall
the
courts
force
private
citizens
and
officials
and
general
assemblies
to
make
decisions
when
the
area
is
charged
with
the
motions?
any
such
impatient
attitude
by
courts
would
certainly
not
be
in
keeping
with
the
decision
in
this
case
where
it
was
stated
that
flexible
principles
of
equity
in
adjusting
and
reconciling
public
needs
should
come
in
to
being.
can
it
be
logically
argued
that
the
ruling
of
this
court
can
be
carried
out,
as
this
court
said
it
should
in
an
effective
manner,
when
schools
are
closed
or
if
operated
at
all
with
armed
troops
parading
not
only
the
ground
with
the
halls
and
classrooms
themselves?
patients
and
forbearance
for
a
short
while
might
save
our
public
school
system
in
little
rock
which
was
once
the
pride
of
our
community
to
vacate
the
stay
order
might
as
effectively
destroy
our
public
school
--
school
system
under
the
present
atmosphere
and
if
not
given
time.
as
if
you
planted
a
bomb
under
each
integrated
school
building
in
the
district
and
lighted
the
fuses
one-by-one.
only
this
court
has
the
answer.one
answer
leads
to
the
immediate
destruction,
in
our
best
judgment
of
our
public
school
program
in
little
rock,
depriving
white
and
negro
students
alike
of
their
search
for
an
education.
the
other
answer,
without
depriving
these
petitioners
of
any
tangible
rights
or
benefits
gives
a
recess
from
a
turmoil
and
the
hope
of
acceptable
solutions.
this
is
the
answer
we
perfectly
see.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
have
with
me
as
co-counsel,
mr.
a.
f.
house
of
the
little
rock
bar.
he
has
been
admitted
to
practice
before
this
court
for
many
years.
we
also
have
as
co-counsel,
mr.
john
haley
of
little
rock
who
has
not
yet
been
admitted
to
practice
before
this
court,
but
who
we
hope
will
be
given
permission
to
appear
on
the
briefs
as
his
name
does
appear
there
in
this
title.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
if
you
please
sir,
but
not
for
the
purpose
of
oral
argument.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
thank
you
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
for
the
record
and
in
view
of
the
court's
ruling
that
amicus
curiae
briefs
will
not
be
permitted,
we
would
like
for
the
record
to
show,
however,
that
it
has
been
the
position
of
these
petitioners
for
this
writ,
not
to
withhold
their
consent
for
any
amicus
curiae
brief
to
be
filed
by
any
proper
person.
we
have
had
them
submitted
to
us.
i'm
afraid
that
all
of
them
have
not
come
to
our
attention
particularly,
and
we
have
perhaps
not
responded
to
those,
but
for
this
record
we
would
like
to
state
that
we
have
no
objection
to
any
briefs
amicus
curiae
being
filed
and
being
considered
by
this
court.
we
have
stated
the
issues
as
we
see
them
in
our
brief.
we
see
no
particular
reason
at
this
time
to
read
those.
we've
tired
to
state
them
as
succinctly
and
yet
as
fully
as
we
believe
this
court
would
have
us
do.
we
believe
that
the
manner
and
the
methods
employed
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
two
brown
decisions
of
1954
and
1955
recognized
the
complexities
of
this
problem
as
had
previous
courts
in
determining
issues
of
a
similar
nature.
both
of
the
brown
decisions
in
our
opinion
reflect
an
understanding
by
this
court
of
the
history
of
the
negro
race
and
of
the
cultural
patterns
throughout
this
land.
as
mr.
blossom,
the
superintendent
of
the
little
rock
school
board
stated
and
we
quoted
him
in
the
brief
and
we
quoted
him
at
the
last
hearing,
he
has
set
forth
we
think
an
accurate
outline
of
the
history
of
this
minority
group
within
this
country.
and
briefly
it
is
this
that
from
1619
to
1865
history
shows
that
there
was
slavery
in
this
land.
that
is
a
period
of
two-and-a-half
centauries.
from
1865
to
1896,
i
believe
the
way
he
termed
it
and
some
historians
termed
it
as
enforced
citizenship.
that
was
a
period
of
31
years,
ending
as
he
viewed
it
and
as
we
view
it,
and
as
many
historians
view
it,
by
the
case
of
plessy
versus
ferguson
which
announced
separate
but
equal
doctrine
insofar
as
educational
processes
in
this
country
are
concerned,
public
education.
the
third
period
we
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
announced
the
doctrine
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
did
not
deal
with
public
education
of
course.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
of
course
we
all
recognize
that
the
case
itself
dealt
with
public
transportation.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
but
the
dictum
in
the
case
was
the
first
that
i'm
aware
of
where
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal
facilities
was
held
to
be
constitutional.
then
from
1896
until
1954,
of
course
this
country
operated
under
that
doctrine.
that
was
a
period
of
58
years.
from
1954
until
now
and
into
the
future,
there
are
question
marks
of
course,
as
to
the
period
of
time
that
effective
education
can
pass
from
the
transition
period,
from
the
separate
but
equal
doctrine
into
complete
desegregation.
we
believe
that
this
court
recognized
that
time
was
required
for
certain
cultural
patterns
to
change,
and
that
obviously
this
court
recognized
the
necessity
or
at
least
the
desirability
of
referring
those
matters
to
the
local
district
courts
for
innumerable
problems
which
this
court
recognized
would
arise
and
some
of
which
were
enumerated
in
the
decision.
deliberate
speed
as
used
by
this
court
is
certainly
not
just
a
phrase
coined
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
or
developed
as
a
philosophy
of
opportunism
to
solve
an
immediate
problem,
but
instead
to
us
it
was
a
carefully
conceived
philosophy
of
deliberation,
which
along
for
legal
reasons
for
delay,
as
outlined
by
this
court
in
the
second
brown
decision,
allows
for
the
flexibility
and
the
delay
provided
in
the
decision
by
district
judge
harry
j.
lemley.
in
effect
it
provides
for
a
transition
from
one
era
to
another
or
from
one
set
of
standards
to
another.
now
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
this
quotation
“and
if
you
go
back
to
the
brown
decision
and
study
its
terms,
you
will
see
that
this
court
with
due
regard
for
the
almost
inestimable
value
of
the
public
schools
to
the
american
people,
used
every
care
that
it
could
conceive
to
try
to
protect
that
system
provided
that
the
people
who
were
trying
to
work
in
the
public
school
system
and
the
state
officials
had
a
duty
also
to
preserve
it
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
set
about
the
task
to
try
to
carry
out
the
brown
decision
in
good
faith
at
every
step
of
the
way.
we
all
know
as
lawyers
and
the
public
knows
it
from
its
experience
that
the
courts
have
had
equitable
principles
that
they
have
worked
with
over
the
centuries
and
the
court
in
the
brown
case
in
a
note
refers
to
that
fact,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
which
that
is
set
out.
and
a
court
of
equity
does
not
ask
people
any
time
or
any
place
to
do
things
that
are
beyond
their
power,
things
that
they
cannot
do.”
that
ends
the
quotation
and
those
are
not
our
words,
but
those
are
the
words
of
the
honorable
solicitor
general
at
the
last
hearing
on
this
case.
no
one
has
ever
questioned
the
good
faith
of
the
little
rock
school
board.
it
has
been
admitted
from
time
to
time
by
counsel
for
naacp
by
the
honorable
solicitor
general
by
every
court
before
which
this
board
has
appeared,
and
is
implicit
in
some
of
the
comments
made
by
the
justices
at
this
last
hearing.
again
we
find
in
the
words
of
the
honorable
solicitor
general
and
i
am
sure
that
this
court
in
the
decision
in
the
brown
case
in
its
implementation
did
not
want
in
any
way
to
loose
the
public
school
system
in
obtaining
and
enforcing
this
principle
of
constitutional
law.
there
is
ample
provision
in
the
brown
case
implementing
the
declaration
about
constitutional
law
for
time
if
it
is
actually
needed
in
good
faith
to
try
to
carry
out
this
constitutional
principle.
it
is
all
there
and
no
court
of
equity
in
this
country
would
fail
to
recognize
those
needs
if
they
are
properly
brought
to
its
attention
and
if
the
action
is
in
good
faith
and
everybody
according
to
basic
principles
of
equitable
law
has
done
everything
within
his
power
up
to
that
point
to
accomplish
the
court's
decree.
that
is
when
an
equity
court
comes
in
and
acts
to
help
out
someone
who
has
tried
and
done
his
level
best
in
accordance
with
all
the
means
at
his
command
and
then
ask
for
some
help
or
relief.
again
i
state
that
is
a
quotation
from
the
honorable
solicitor
general
made
before
this
court
two
weeks
ago.
now
as
that
--
with
that
as
a
background
or
as
a
statement
which
of
course
we
are
willing
to
accept,
judge
lemley,
who
heard
the
decision
--
who
heard
the
evidence
before
he
rendered
his
decision
after
a
trial
of
some
three
days
and
after
briefs
had
been
submitted,
made
these
statements.
now
if
your
honors
please,
judge
lemley's
decision
in
our
opinion
is
so
important.
it
so
well
considered.
it's
so
effectively
gives
the
background
of
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
the
school
board
in
operating
a
public
school
system.
and
the
evidence
is
so
clear
in
that
case
and
he
outlines
it,
although
he
takes
some
19
pages
to
write
his
opinion,
we
feel
so
strongly
that
that
should
be
carefully
considered
by
every
individual
member
of
this
court
that
by
quoting
only
short
portions
of
it
in
our
oral
argument
we
trust
that
the
court
will
not
believe
that
we
slight
any
particular
portion
of
it.
the
full
decision
of
judge
lemley
as
well
as
the
full
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
in
the
pleadings
that
have
already
been
filed
heretofore
before
this
court.
now
in
the
light
of
the
solicitor
general's
remarks,
let's
look
at
some
of
the
things
that
judge
lemley
said
in
his
decision.
as
has
been
said,
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
board
made
a
prompt
and
reasonable
start
toward
compliance
with
the
principles
laid
down
in
the
brown
cases.
thereafter,
it
put
its
plan
into
operation
and
has
adhered
to
it
in
good
faith
in
the
face
of
great
difficulties.
now
it
has
come
here
seeking
relief
only
after
it
has
been
confronted
with
what
is
from
an
educational
standpoint
an
intolerable
situation
and
it
does
not
ask
for
an
abandonment
of
its
plan
nor
does
it
attempt
to
obtain
indefinite
postponement.
it
is
simply
requesting
a
practical
delay
and
we
are
convinced
that
in
seeking
this
delay
the
board
is
still
acting
in
good
faith,
and
upon
the
showing
that
has
been
made,
we
are
satisfied
that
the
board
needs
more
time
to
carry
out
its
plan
in
an
effective
manner,
that
to
grant
the
instant
petition
is
in
the
public
interest
and
is
consistent
with
good
faith
compliance
at
the
earliest
practicable
day
with
the
principles
above
mentioned.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
we
are
not
unmindful
of
the
admonition
of
the
supreme
court
that
the
vitality
of
those
principles
cannot
be
allowed
to
yield
simply
because
of
disagreement
with
it.
here,
however,
as
pointed
out
by
the
board
in
its
final
brief,
the
opposition
to
integration
in
little
rock
is
more
than
a
mere
mental
attitude.
it
has
manifested
itself
in
overt
acts
which
have
actually
damaged
educational
standards
and
which
will
continue
to
do
so
if
relief
is
not
granted.
we
have
seen
that
the
supreme
court
said
in
the
second
brown
decision
that
the
transition
from
a
formerly
segregated
school
to
a
school
free
from
compulsory
segregation
should
be
carried
out
in
an
effective
manner
and
that
such
a
transition
is
in
the
public
interest.
in
our
estimation
a
transition
which
impairs
or
disrupts
educational
programs
and
standards
and
which
will
continue
to
do
so
is
not
in
the
public
interest,
but
on
the
other
hand
inflicts
irreparable
harm
upon
all
of
the
students
concerned
regardless
of
race.
whereas
here
such
a
transition
is
being
undertaken
under
the
compulsive
effects
of
a
federal
court
order,
a
refusal
to
modify
such
an
order
so
as
to
ameliorate
the
situation
would
in
our
opinion
under
the
circumstances
here
present
be
inequitable
if
not
arbitrary
as
well.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
don't
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
that
we
are
attempting
to
divorce
that.
that
is
the
primary
problem
that
this
school
board
has
in
carrying
out
its
plan
of
integration
or
its
plan
of
desegregation
which
i
think
is
more
accurate.
when
it
as
an
arm
of
the
state
government
is
ordered
to
do
one
thing
by
one
court
and
by
its
employer
so
to
speak,
the
state
of
arkansas
obviously
is
ordered
to
do
something
else.
we
have
not
in
any
sense
so
far
as
i
am
aware
attempted
to
divorce
that.
we
wish
we
could
but
we
cannot.
it
is
implicit
and
inherent
and
intertwined
in
this
particular
problem.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
we
certainly
have
been
faced
with
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
that
in
incipiency
maybe
was
not
aware
to
everyone
at
the
time,
but
it
was
a
latent
problem
that
exploded
and
which
was
not
anticipated
by
the
school
board
and
i
say
by
the
people
in
little
rock
generally
and
i
dare
say
by
the
courts
themselves.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
they
thought
it
was
peaceful
up
until
just
a
few
weeks
before
the
actual
opening
of
schools
for
the
1957-1958
school
year
in
little
rock.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
mr.
justice
frankfurter
let
me
state
as
concisely
as
i
can
our
position.
i
believe
i
stated
when
we
were
here
before,
that
we
do
not
intend
to
tell
this
court
that
we
believe
that
all
of
the
problems
wrapped
up
in
this
distressing
situation
can
be
solved
in
two-and-a-half
years
or
six
months
or
ten
years
or
any
other
particular
length
of
time.
we
do
earnestly
believe
this
that
without
a
reasonable
period
of
calm,
that
solutions,
proper
lasting
solutions
have
no
chance
of
success.
now
whether
that
period
be
six
months,
whether
it
be
two-and-a-half
years,
whether
it
be
ten
years,
not
being
clairvoyant
we
have
no
way
of
knowing,
but
in
the
combined
judgment
of
the
school
board,
with
the
experience
that
it
had,
it
felt
that
it
did
not
have
a
good
chance
of
arriving
at
solutions
in
less
than
that,
that
approximate
period
of
time.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
this
that
from
a
practical
standpoint
as
far
the
problem
facing
this
school
board,
it
makes
no
difference
why
this
particular
plan
has
failed
to
be
accepted
at
this
time.
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
gave
the
illustration
of
a
trucker
or
a
(inaudible)
being
ordered
by
a
court
let's
say,
going
from
point
a
to
point
b
and
there
is
a
bridge
across
a
chasm,
and
he
attempts
to
carry
out
his
assignment,
and
he
gets
to
the
bridge
and
for
reasons
completely
beyond
his
control
the
bridge
is
no
longer
there.
we
feel
that
the
school
board
would
be
in
the
position
if
this
court
or
any
other
court
directed
it
to
cross
that
chasm
without
a
bridge
that
it
would
be
saying,
you
go
over
the
brink
to
your
fate.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
just
was
going
to
conclude
mr.
justice
frankfurter
this
thought,
that
to
that
(inaudible)
it
makes
no
difference
why
the
bridge
is
not
there.
now,
it
maybe
a
proper
function
of
some
judicial
body
or
even
an
executive
body
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
destruction
of
the
bridge
was
malicious
or
whether
it
was
as
a
result
of
an
act
of
god
or
whatnot,
but
to
the
man
who
has
the
problem
right
then
of
getting
across
the
chasm,
as
this
school
board
has
the
responsibility,
its
main
responsibility
of
providing
for
proper
educational
system
in
the
city
of
little
rock,
it
makes
no
difference
to
it
why
the
bridge
was
destroyed.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
to
answer
the
first
part
of
question
mr.
chief
justice,
it
has
been
very
heartening
to
the
lawyers
in
this
case,
that
the
school
board
members
have
refrained
at
any
time
from
dealing
in
personalities
whether
they
be
negro
children,
whether
they
be
the
governor,
whether
they
be
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
any
other
person.
they
have
looked
on
their
major
responsibility
as
continuing
an
acceptable
educational
system
within
the
city
of
little
rock
and
they
have
refrained,
although
they
have
been
taunted
and
prompted
at
times
to
deal
in
personalities,
fortunately
they
have
resisted
that
temptation
insofar
as
i
am
personally
aware.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
maybe
concerned
with
a
whole
lot
of
things.
the
thing
that
we
are
pleading
for
is
and
we
have
tried
our
best
to
keep
it
on
this
particular
basis.
we
feel
very
earnestly
that
the
little
rock
school
board
is
entitled
to
be
heard
before
this
tribunal
as
well
as
others,
on
its
own
record
and
for
its
own
purposes.
now
we
are
not
unmindful
of
course
of
the
problems
of
a
similar
nature
in
other
sections
of
the
country
and
in
other
states,
but
we
have
done
the
best
we
could
to
try
to
keep
out
any
foreign
issues
and
to
request
the
local
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
to
look
at
our
problems
in
little
rock.
we
are
not
here
to
plead,
because
we
are
not
familiar
with
situations
in
other
states,
and
their
particular
problems,
and
it
seems
to
us
that,
that
is
the
very
basic
wisdom
when
the
united
states
supreme
court
did
abandon
the
doctrine
of
separate,
but
equal
and
change,
that
when
it
gave
to
the
local
district
courts
that
power
to
determine
the
local
problems
as
they
might
arise,
that
we
are
entitled
as
a
school
board
of
little
rock
to
have
our
local
judge
on
the
evidence
presented,
determine
that
case
for
that
particular
case
and
no
other.
now,
the
results
of
that
decision
may
by
either
side
or
both
sides
be
pointed
out
for
their
own
purposes
in
other
areas
of
the
country.
but
we,
and
although
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
we
are
not
concerned
about
it,
because
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
concerned
about
this
problem,
but
it
is
not
our
obligation
or
duty
to
be
unduly
concerned
about
what
precedent
maybe
set
or
what
effect
it
may
have
in
other
sections
of
the
country.
we
have
enough
problems
in
little
rock
if
we
stick
to
this
particular
problem
there.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
without
giving
undue
consideration
to
what
might
happen
somewhere
else.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
gets
at
one
--
at
the
heart
of
this
issue
and
i
--
if
i
may
suggest
i
get
into
that
a
little
farther
in
my
argument,
if
i
may?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
there
is
one
thing
that
i
would
like
–
i'd
like
to
answer
a
little
further
the
grave
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
wouldn't
it
be
proper
to
construct
the
bridge
and
i
thoroughly
agree
with
that
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
that
in
the
construction
of
a
bridge,
it
does
take
deliberate
speed
at
least
and
one
very
eminent
jurist
on
this
court
some
twelve
years
ago
made
this
comment
in
an
opinion.
“in
any
event
mere
speed
is
a
test
of
justice,
deliberate
speed
is.
deliberate
speed
takes
time
but
it
is
time
well
spent.”
mr.
richard
c.
butler
if
it
were
backed
up
by
a
state
authority?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
oh
–-
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
i
think
not,
if
the
various
laws
in
the
state
and
the
various
executives
which
have
supervisory
power
including
the
general
assembly
of
state
of
arkansas
had
taken
the
position
that
some
other
states
have
taken
in
the
north,
new
york
and
various
other
states,
this
school
board
wouldn't
have
any
problem
and
there
it
would
be
no,
no
purpose
or
reason
for
it
to
ask
for
a
delay.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
but
i
can't
at
this
moment
as
history
has
unfolded
itself
in
the
last
months
anticipate
that
any
such
situation
could
be
reversed
and
take
place
in
the
state
of
arkansas
at
this
time
or
for
that
matter
any
other
south
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
because
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
because
mr.
justice
harlan
of
various
factors
that
are
completely
beyond
its
control,
including
the
total
opposition
of
the
people
and
the
state
government
of
arkansas.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
is
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
is
such
a
matter
of
personal
and
individual
opinion
that
i
would
prefer
not
to
express
my
own
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
mr.
justice
clark
this
board
has
tried
to
take
the
problems
as
they
arose
one
at
a
time.
it
has
not
made
any
particular
plans
for
specific
action
or
decisions
within
the
next
two-and-a-half
years
because
it
has
not
known
whether
it
was
going
to
have
two-and-a-half
years
or
not.
now
if
that
is
determined
then
it
does
have
tentative
plans
of
things
that
it
feels
might
help
toward
an
ultimate
and
sound
solution
of
these
problems.
they
are
tentative
and
we
try
to
take
first
things
first
and
we
think
the
first
thing
is
for
the
court
to
draft
the
time
that
judge
lemley
gave
us
feeling
that
you
cannot
reach
sound
conclusions
in
a
state
of
chaos
and
hysteria.
and
i
dare
say
that
if
this
board
is
given
the
two-and-a-half
year
delay
that
it
would
be
wise
although
this
is
my
personal
opinion
to
let
things
kind
of
simmer
down
for
at
least
a
few
weeks
or
few
months
before
any
further
plans
were
actually
promulgated,
but
that
as
properly
as
could
be,
solutions
would
be
sought
and
attempts
made
to
reconcile
the
differences
that
exist
in
this
conflict.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
that
i
think
that
states
our
position
very
clearly
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
do
indeed.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
we
don't
look
at
it
that
way
mr.
chief
justice.
we
don't
feel
that
it
is.
we
have
the
hope
that
solutions
can
be
reached
if
given
an
opportunity
in
an
atmosphere
that
is
conducive
to
reaching
solutions.
now
i
say
again
that
we
do
not
know
that
that
can
be
done
in
any
stated
length
of
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
petition
which
was
filed
before
judge
lemley,
requested
an
indefinite
period
to
be
determined
by
the
court
on
the
evidence
as
to
how
long.
and
judge
lemley
made
a
statement
to
all
parties
concerned
directing
that
the
school
board
members
collectively
and
individually
be
present
in
which
he
said
the
primary
responsibility
for
the
exercise
of
judgment
is
on
the
school
board.
you
determine
and
file
an
amendment
to
your
petition
as
to
whether
or
not
you
believe
such
and
such
a
length
of
time
should
prevail
or
whether
you
want
to
change
your
plan
in
some
manner
and
i
think
his
reasoning
on
that
was
perfectly
sound
because
the
court
itself
has
said
that
the
primary
responsibility
is
on
the
school
boards.
now
we
agree
with
that
and
we
feel
that
the
first
exercise
of
judgment
should
be
on
the
school
board
itself
and
then
it
should
be
under
the
supervision
of
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
the
school
board
acted
in
good
faith
and
used
good
judgment,
and
if
not
then
based
on
the
evidence
he
could
say
so.
and
judge
lemley,
using
that
judicial
discretion,
directed
to
him
by
this
court,
did
so
and
found
that
the
school
board
was
justified
in
asking
for
that
delay.
the
point
i
am
making
is
simply
this
that
the
school
board
admitted
from
the
very
beginning
that
it
was
--
it
could
not
foretell
the
future
well
enough
to
say
that
any
exact
period
of
time
was
necessary
to
solve
the
problem,
but
judgments
had
to
be
made
and
used
and
it
used
its
judgment
in
suggesting
to
judge
lemley
this
period
of
time
which
he
apparently
felt
was
necessary
to
carry
out
or
have
any
possibility
of
a
solution
of
these
problems.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
think
mr.
chief
justice
that,
that
is
a
matter
for
the
local
district
court
to
determine
in
his
judicial
discretion
considering
all
the
factors
and
all
the
evidence
available
and
presented
to
him
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
again
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
this
school
board
has
not
--
does
not
have
any
plans
to
do
anything.
in
the
first
place
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
felt
most
strongly
was
that
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
whatever
that
maybe,
would
be
for
the
purpose
of
testing
certain
laws,
state
laws
which
have
not
even
been
tested
by
the
state
supreme
court.
now
in
the
opinion
of
many
lawyers,
the
state
supreme
court
of
arkansas
will
possibly
hold
unconstitutional
many
of
the
acts
which
the
legislature
has
passed,
and
perhaps
in
its
judgment
fall
in
line
with
the
united
state
supreme
court
in
varying
degrees
and
recognize
the
superiority
of
this
court
in
determining
federal
questions.
now,
in
such
an
event,
in
such
an
event
the
people
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
in
the
other
states
if
i
may
suggest,
will
then
have
heard
from
judges
that
are
close
to
them,
that
are
closer
to
their
own
local
scenes
and
have
a
better
understanding
of
what
their
responsibilities
as
citizens
may
be.
now
that
is
one
of
the
primary
factors
that
we
--
that
the
school
board
gave
consideration
to
and
some
of
those
cases,
some
of
those
statutes
are
right
now
under
consideration
and
moving
toward
our
state
supreme
court
and
we
think
that
such
a
period
of
time,
through
the
normal
processes
in
our
state
and
i'm
sure
its
true
in
other
states
takes
about
a
year,
year-and-a-half,
two
years
to
get
that
sort
of
question
decided
by
the
various
state
supreme
courts.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
that's
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
one
of
the
things
we
would
have
to
determine
if
and
when
that
time
came.
we're
very
frank
to
admit,
we
don't
have
all
of
the
answers,
but
we
hope
that
whether,
and
after
a
decision
by
this
court
in
this
particular
case,
that
it
will
give
us
at
least
a
framework
which
we
earnestly
feel
could
be
done
within
the
decision
and
opinion
of
the
brown
decision
to
work
out
some
of
our
problems.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
now,
one
of
the
laws
that
i
referred
to
is
an
establishment
of
a
so
called
sovereignty
commission
which
--
that
law
was
passed
in
1957.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
the
package
of
laws
that
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
was
a
result
of
a
special
session
of
our
general
assembly
this
past
month.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
was
about
coincident
with
the
time
we
were
appearing
here
before.
as
matter
of
a
fact
i
believe
the
legislature
was
in
session
two
weeks
ago
to
the
best
of
my
recollection.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
that
was
after
judge
lemley's
orders,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
mainly,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
briefly
mr.
justice
black
the
sovereignty
law
established
a
sovereignty
commission
to
pass
on
certain
things
among
which
are
problems
involving
this
issue
of
desegregation
of
schools,
as
well
as
other
types
of
conflicts
that
may
arise
between
the
races,
the
white
and
the
negro
races.
that
law
incidentally
was
--
a
three-judge
federal
court
was
called
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
it.
that
court
deferred
its
action
until
it
was
passed
upon
by
the
state
supreme
court.
it
has
now
been
held
constitutional
by
the
local
chancery
court,
which
is
not
an
unusual
situation.
i
mean
out
lower
courts
in
our
state
ordinarily
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
acts
passed
by
the
general
assembly
and
leave
that
function
to
be
--
to
the
state
supreme
court,
the
appellate
court
where
they
think
it
belongs,
and
it
is
now
in
the
process
of
being
appealed
to
the
supreme
court.
now
that
is
only
one
example
of
the
type
of
law
that
we
have
in
mind.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
don't
recall
the
specific
wording
of
it.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
particular
reference,
and
i
don't
think
the
specific
purpose
was
that
limited
mr.
justice
black.
it's
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it's
a
commission
that
is
setup
to
deal
with
and
at
least
make
recommendations
and
determinations
on
various
problems
which
have
been
engendered
by
this
particular
conflict.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
not
for
schools
as
such.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
not
for
schools
as
such
as
i
recall,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
i
have
those
acts.
they
have
been
passed.
there
were
six
acts
that
were
sponsored
by
the
present
state
administration.
those
were
all
passed.
there
were
some
other
suggested,
some
of
which
as
i
recall
were
defeated,
others
were
passed
primarily
at
the
instance
of
the
state
attorney
general.
the
statutes
passed
by
the
general
assembly
sponsored
by
the
government
deal
exclusively
with
educational
problems,
some
of
the
others
deal
with
other
phases
of
the
larger
problem.
now
the
present
situation
if
i'm
correctly
informed
as
of
this
moment
is
that
those
laws
have
been
passed
by
the
general
assembly,
but
have
not
been
signed
by
the
government,
and
whether
they
will
be
or
not,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
not
in
that
language.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
not
one
of
those
laws.
we
made
mention
i
believe
of
the
pupil
assignment
law
of
arkansas
and
that
statute
specifically
provides
that
in
the
determination
of
various
factors,
some
ten
or
a
dozen
factors
that
school
boards
may
properly
consider
in
admitting
particular
students
to
school.
the
provision
in
that
statute
obviously
took
into
consideration
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
stated
that
race
would
not
be
a
factor
in
determining
the
admission
or
non-admission
of
any
student
in
any
school
in
arkansas.
now
that
particular
statute
passed
some
two
years
ago,
a
year-and-a-half
ago,
did
very
definitely
take
into
consideration
the
brown
decisions.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
it
was
certainly
an
accurate
statement
that
i
intended
to
make
that
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
our
supreme
court
is
going
to
say
in
any
particular
situation,
but
we
have
a
good
deal
of
confidence
in
the
ability
and
integrity
of
our
state
supreme
court
and
it
will
be
surprising
to
many
lawyers
in
arkansas
if
all
of
those
acts
of
the
legislature
are
held
to
be
constitutional
by
our
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
could
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
we
do
think
so.
we
do
indeed.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
is
certainly
true
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
electors
of
that
state
by
an
overwhelming
majority
voted
such
a
constitutional
amendment
to
which
you
have
referred
in
which
they
stated
that
every
constitutional
method
should
be
examined
and
pursued
and
put
into
effect
to
avoid
the
mixing
of
the
races
in
the
public
school
systems
in
arkansas,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
is
in
that
amendment
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
in
that
language.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
has
never
been
our
position.
we
--
the
school
board
from
the
very
beginning
and
its
attorneys
have
gone
on
the
presumption,
on
the
conclusion
not
just
a
presumption
that
the
decision
in
the
brown
cases
was
the
law
that
must
be
followed
and
it
was
because
of
that
or
because
of
those
decisions
that
the
school
board
formulated
this
plan
of
desegregation
and
i
think
it
is
fair
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
that
is
and
that
if
you
please
sir
is
still
the
position
of
this
school
board.
now
i
think
it's
fair
to
that
point
however
to
state
that
the
school
board
and
a
vast
majority
of
the
people
in
the
immediate
locality
of
little
rock
are
fundamentally,
socially
opposed
to
segregation
of
the
races
in
the
public
schools.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
but
in
spite
of
that
feeling,
the
school
board
formulated
this
plan
in
trying
to
carry
on
a
school
system
and
at
the
same
time
following
the
law,
abiding
by
the
law.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
i
am
familiar
with
that.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
mr.
justice
brennan
i
have
that
later
on
in
my
argument,
but
since
you
have
brought
it
up
now,
let's
see
if
we
can
dispose
of
it
which
in
effect
i
was
going
to
conclude
with,
but
in
view
of
your
question
i
think
we
might
as
well
answer
it
right
now
and
that's
simply
this
as
we
see
it.
we
have
described
here
a
situation
where
the
school
board
which
is
a
creature
of
the
state,
it's
an
arm
of
the
state
government,
is
placed
between
the
millstones
as
justice
sanborn
of
the
eighth
circuit
said
“between
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstone,”
in
a
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
government
and
the
–
and
all
of
the
agencies
of
each.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
we
have
pointed
out
the
absurdity
of
the
premise
that
a
school
district
should
keep
the
peace.
now
i
have
something
to
say
about
that
when
i
get
back
on
the
principle
argument,
but
here
is
what
we
are
suggesting
and
which
will
be
borne
out
by
the
balance
of
our
argument,
that
the
problem
is
not
yet
been
grasped
by
attorney
general's
office
or
the
solicitor
general,
and
by
the
eighth
circuit
of
appeals
in
a
situation
of
this
kind.
and
we
think
that
a
plan
of
desegregation
which
has
the
planning
along
with
it
for
the
support
of
that
plan
in
an
effective
manner
is
something
that
can
be
done
by
the
agencies
which
are
setup
for
those
purposes
by
the
federal
and
state
the
governments
but
certainly
not
by
there
school
board.
now
some
plan
it
seems
to
us
adequate
enforcement
must
come
forward
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
conflict
that
runs
head-on
so
to
speak
between
your
federal
and
your
state
governments.
now,
at
that
point,
that
is
again
the
reason
that
we
are
asking
for
additional
time
for
those
conflicts
which
are
completely
beyond
the
realm
of
this
school
board
to
solve
and
be
given
an
opportunity
to
be
solved
by
the
two
sovereignties
involved.
now
we
think
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that's
one
answer
yes,
and
that
has
been
seriously
propounded
by
students
of
this
problem
that
that
the
congress
should
act
in
this
field
and
that
perhaps
sometime
it
will.
it
has
struggled
with
the
problem
but
to
my
knowledge
it
has
not
passed
any
legislation
involving
it.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
mr.
justice
brennan
there
may
have
been
times,
and
i'm
no
student
of
the
history
of
the
supreme
court
in
its
relationship
with
the
legislative
branch
of
this
government,
but
at
least
to
my
limited
knowledge,
i
don't
recall
anytime
when
the
congress
even
after
a
determination
of
the
law
by
this
court
has
ever
really
felt
compelled
to
pass
any
particular
legislation
because
of
a
particular
decision.
now,
there
have
been
many
instances
i
believe
both
in
the
federal
government
and
in
that
state,
where
a
certain
court
decisions
have
prompted
the
legislative
bodies
of
the
national
government
or
the
state
government
to
pass
laws
which
would
circumvent
that
particular
court
decision.
at
least
that
has
happened
in
our
state
many
times,
where
the
court
did
not
express
the
will
of
the
people
as
determined
by
the
legislative
body
and
i
think
that
probably
history
will
bear
that
out
insofar
as
the
national
congress
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
the
little
rock
school
board,
no
sir
it
has
not.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir
it
--
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
at
least
there
has
never
been
any
suggestion
formally
made
certainly
on
the
part
of
this
school
board
to
request
congress
to
pass
any
law
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
think
the
action
of
the
school
board
at
that
point,
if
we
may
project
our
thinking
for
a
few
moments
to
that
period
of
time,
would
simply
be
to
sit
back
and
wait,
for
this
reason.
there
are
some
of
the
laws
that
have
been
passed
by
this
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
arkansas
recently,
and
which
if
signed
by
the
governor
for
all
practical
purposes
insofar
as
desegregated
schools
are
concerned
within
the
district
have
been
taken
away
from
the
authority
of
the
school
board
and
put
under
the
direct
control
of
the
governor.
so,
the
school
board
would
have
to
wait
to
see
what
the
governor
did
because
certainly
the
legislative
assembly
in
the
state
of
arkansas
has
the
ultimate
control
of
the
operation
of
the
school
system,
that
has
been
held
by
our
court
many
times,
and
this
school
board
would
be
in
a
further
untenable
position
of
not
having
the
power
as
we
see
it,
even
to
proceed
to
the
extent
that
it
has
it
the
past.
it
would
then
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
it
has
not,
it's
been
passed
by
the
general
assembly
and
may
and
will
become
law,
all
of
those
whichever
ones
are
signed
by
the
chief
executive.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
if
we
can
use
a
little
hindsight
i
certainly
think
that's
true,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
there
in
looking
back
on
it.
now
this
school
board
said
at
the
very
beginning
when
it
formulated
this
plan
and
did
its
best
over
a
period
of
at
least
a
year
to
explain
to
all
responsible
groups
within
that
area,
its
plan
it
felt
that
it
had
let's
say
public
sufferance
at
least
if
not
active
support.
the
board
never
did
feel
that
it
had
the
active
support
or
integration
from
any
majority
of
the
people
of
the
community.
it
felt
and
it
did
--
felt
it
was
its
duty
and
it
did
try
to
lead
the
thinking
along
that
line,
so
that
it
could
both
carry
out
its
function
in
operating
an
educational
system
and
abide
by
the
law,
the
federal
law
of
this
government.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
they
are
opposed
to
desegregation,
there
are
opposed
to
integration.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
i'm
sorry
sir
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
there
are
opposed
to
integration.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
they
are
opposed
to
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
think
i
used
the
term
desegregation.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
at
sufferance
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
they
were
not
active
supporters
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
anything
that
would
lead
to
integration
of
the
public
school
systems.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
there
was
a
conclusion
back
in
1956
by
the
little
rock
school
board,
that
this
plan
of
desegregation
was
acceptable
because
it
was
the
only
plan
that
could
be
acceptable
to
that
community.
it
was
not
supportive
by
the
people
there.
it
was
more
in
our
opinion
as
simply
for
the
time
being
accepted
as
a
possible
solution
and
an
adequate
solution
of
a
very
serious
problem.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
i'm
afraid,
in
all
candor,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
will
have
to
unqualifiedly
agree
with
you,
when
you
say
that
you
feel
that
laws
are
not
ordinarily
acceptable
to
the
people
when
they
came
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
actively
supporting
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
it
comes
to
my
mind
an
illustration
such
as
this,
when
the
eighteen
amendment
was
passed
and
volstead
act
followed,
it
had
in
my
opinion
the
active
support
of
a
majority
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
that
change
and
they
voted
it
out
a
constitutional
amendment
to
that
and
repel
of
that
act.
now
to
me
that
is
a
good
example
of
the
congress
following
the
majority
of
the
thinking
of
the
people
in
the
united
states
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
is
generally
the
way
most
laws
are
passed
if
they
are
to
be
supported
or
even
tolerated
by
a
majority
--
by
the
populace
in
general.
now
that's
just
a
passing
observation
that
i
have
but
i
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
i'm
48
years
old
and
i
have
lived
through
most
of
that.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
did,
i'm
sure
it
did.
i'm
sure
that
the
eighteen
amendment
and
the
volstead
act
were
supported
to
varying
degrees
throughout
this
country,
the
little
history
i've
read
on
it
so
indicates.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
only
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
clark,
that
here
is
a
desegregation
program
that
has
been
going
on
successfully
in
the
north
western
part
of
our
state
at
the
site
of
our
state
university.
that
is
fayetteville,
arkansas,
it's
in
washington
county.
i
say
successfully,
so
far
as
i
am
informed
there
has
been
no
particular
problem
or
strife
about
it,
and
the
people
in
that
community
several
years
ago
accepted
desegregation
in
their
public
schools.
now
in
addition
to
that
for
many
years
there
has
been
opportunity
for
negro
students
on
a
graduate
level
at
our
state
university,
we've
had
some
very
fine
graduate
lawyers
come
out
of
our
law
school
there
and
other
graduate
schools,
not
limited
to
the
law
school.
so
i
would
say
as
a
conclusion
that
in
several
communities
in
arkansas,
desegregation
in
the
public
school
system
has
been
effective
and
without
turmoil.
now
if
we
may
get
back
for
a
few
moments
to
judge
lemley?
he
found
of
course
that
and
as
far
as
he
could
foretell
the
future,
that
these
problems
and
obstacles
before
the
school
board
were
of
such
a
nature
that
it
was
likely
to
require
again
for
this
school
year
the
use
of
troops
in
order
to
protect
life
and
property.
now,
at
our
previous
hearing
one
of
the
justices
aptly
observed
i
should
say
as
a
consequence
of
those
conditions
educational
results
follows.
you
can't
teach
if
you
are
going
to
have
troops
in
the
classroom.
if
that
conclusion
is
correct,
and
that
is
certainly
the
opinion
of
the
little
rock
school
board,
then
the
question
which
this
court
must
answer
for
the
little
rock
school
board
in
this
particular
case
is
this,
is
it
better
to
defer
certain
intangible
constitutional
rights
of
a
few
students
constituting
less
than
1%
of
the
total
enrollment
of
a
school
or
to
insist
upon
the
immediate
fulfillment
of
those
rights
even
if
it
destroys
the
full
educational
opportunities
of
2,000
students
in
that
particular
school
to
say
nothing
of
some
total
21,000
in
the
entire
school
system.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
to
best
of
my
recollection
it's
about
--
there
are
21,000
students
white
and
colored
and
i
believe
the
ratio
is
about
60%
or
65%
white
35%
to
40%
colored.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i'm
saying
that
the
immediate
enforcement
of
the
rights
at
this
particular
time
affects
only
seven
negro
students,
that
the
immediate
insistence,
the
insistence
of
immediate
fulfillment
for
them,
because
the
plan
did
not
contemplate
anymore
than
that
for
this
particular
period.
now
the
plan
did
if
things
had
gone
smoothly,
they
had
intended
to
take
in
more
to
that
school
or
possibly
to
other
schools,
but
the
plan
itself
mr.
chief
justice
was
on
the
basis
of
starting
at
the
high
school
level
first
in
the
three
grades
in
the
high
school
level.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
take
the
position
that
you
are
not
denying
the
right,
you
are
delaying
the
fulfillment
of
a
constitutional
right
which
you
have
said
they
have,
but
not
the
denial
of
the
right
as
a
class
action
which
this
is.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
they
would
be
deprived
of
the
personal
fulfillment
of
what
we
consider
an
intangible
right
expressed
by
this
court.
they
would
not
be
deprived
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
we
do
except
it
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
i
was
distinguishing
that
as
against
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
didn't
have
in
mind
that
sense.
the
point
i'm
making
is
simply
this,
that
you
have
a
conflict
between
two
balances
of
equity
so
to
speak
and
those
balances
must
be
weighed
and
as
counsel
for
naacp
and
others
all
of
us
recognize
in
this
case
and
in
all
cases
of
a
similar
nature,
judge
lemley
certainly
recognized
it,
that
there
must
be
a
balancing
of
equities.
that
you
must
take
into
consideration
the
public
interest
and
the
individual
and
this
court
has
held
in
many
instances
that
where
public
interest
is
involved
as
against
specific
gratification
of
personal
rights,
that
if
it's
of
sufficient
importance,
to
the
public
interest
that
those
gratification
--
that
the
gratification
of
those
rights
maybe
delayed
and
postponed
and
we
think
and
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
brown
decisions.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
had
a
very
fine
educational
system
in
the
city
of
little
rock.
it
has
actually
been
the
pride
of
our
community,
up
until
the
turmoil
of
this
past
year
and
i
think
it's
important.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
overemphasized
that
these
negro
children
as
well
as
all
others
in
little
rock
have
a
new
high
school
building
with
faculty,
all
facilities
by
all
acceptable
standards,
the
equal
of
central
high
school.
now,
in
assigning
and
weighing
and
balancing
the
equities
in
this
case
we
feel
that,
that
is
important.
i
state
again
that
we
are
not
in
this
lawsuit
advocating,
going
back
to
the
separate
but
equal
doctrine,
but
we
do
think
that
in
applying
the
flexible
principles
of
equity
which
this
court
said
should
be
applied;
that,
that
is
a
factor
to
take
into
consideration
and
certainly
no
negro
student
will
be
deprived
of
an
education
in
qualified
schools,
that
is
schools
with
adequate
physical
facilities
and
excellent
faculties,
if
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
brown
decision
are
merely
postponed
for
a
while.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
has
been
considered
not
once
but
many
times,
and
it's
been
the
board's
observation
that
such
a
program
in
some
instances
has
been
workable,
in
others
there
--
i
think
they
tried
that
in
nashville,
tennessee,
the
first
grade
and
that
resulted
in
the
bombing
of
the
school
there.
this
board
came
to
the
conclusion
because
of
various
geographical
factors,
the
housing
situation,
the
physical
facilities
of
all
the
schools
in
the
system,
that
it
was
better
to
attempt
to
start
at
the
high
school
level
than
at
the
lower
grades.
now,
i
think
that
some
of
the
school
board
members
as
well
as
some
of
the
population
of
the
area
in
looking
back
and
having
the
advantage
of
observing
the
events
which
have
taken
place
can
argue
without
fear
of
serious
contradiction
that
maybe
we
should
have
started
at
the
other
end.
now
that's
hindsight.
it
was
there
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it
might
work
better
and
it
might
not.
there
is
quite
a
divided
opinion
on
that
mr.
justice
clark,
but
this
board
is
--
it
still
feels
that
it's
plan
is
given
proper
time
and
free
of
certain
obstacles
over
which
it
has
no
control
can
be
successful.
but
many
people
argue
and
i
can't
say
that
they're
wrong,
that
it
might
be
better
to
start
at
the
first
grade.
there
are
some
very
good
reasons
why
they
did
not
do
that.
at
beginning
as
i
say
the
location
of
the
races
within
the
city
dictated
and
appeared
at
that
time,
it
was
better
to
start
at
the
high
school
level.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
there
is
a
kindergarten
provided
as
i
understand
it,
but
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
free
public
education
or
system.
it's
operated
in
a
combination
and
in
conjunction
with
the
public
school
system,
but
i
think
operated
by
private
individuals,
if
they
so
desire
and
they
feel.
the
public
school
system
starts
at
the
age
of
six
for
the
children.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
i
think
they've
studied
every
possible
plan
that's
ever
been
suggested
to
them.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
personally
know
the
terms
of
the
plan
you
have
in
mind,
but
i
know
this
school
board
has
studied
every
possible
solution
that
has
been
called
to
its
attention.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
has
been
suggested
and
one
of
the
statutes
passed
recently
incorporates
that
general
quality
into
it,
and
many
people
in
our
area
feel
that,
that
has
possibilities,
and
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
be
explored
in
a
time
free
of
turmoil.
that
is
a
very
definite
possibility,
and
some
very
able
citizens
have
suggested
that
approach
to
it,
which
maybe
the
ultimate
solution.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
he
did
not
make
any
such
finding
of
fact
as
that.
the
farthest
he
went
was
to
say
this,
that
insofar
as
he
could
determine
that
if
the
plan
of
integration
were
not
postponed,
at
this
semester
beginning
september
1958,
that
it
would
result
in
troops
or
i
believe
as
he
put
it
the
equivalent
of
that,
to
be
within
the
school
and
on
the
school
grounds
in
order
to
maintain
order
and
that
it
was
his
belief
that
if
granted
some
delay
such
as
asked
for
by
the
board
for
a
short
period,
that
it
would
provide
a
period
of
calm
relief
from
the
excessive
tension
and
turmoil,
so
that
various
other
things
can
be
considered
and
perhaps
solutions
worked
out.
i
think
that
was
in
effect
what
he
said.
i
don't
believe
he
made
any
determination
of
just
what
might
be
the
result
two-and-a-half
years
from
now,
but
he
did
recognize
that
it
was
essential
for
some
delay
or
postponement
in
order
to
preserve
the
educational
system
in
little
rock,
and
particularly
at
central
high
school.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
that's
in
our
brief
and
that
is
our
position,
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
as
i
said
a
few
moments
ago
mr.
justice
brennan
the
first
petition
to
judge
lemley
on
february
20,
1958
set
no
specific
time
limit,
except
it
was
on
this
basis
that
at
the
present
time
and
for
the
next
school
year,
it
appears
that
if
this
plan
of
desegregation
of
integration
is
carried
forward,
that
we
cannot
as
a
board
continue
our
public
--
a
school
system
in
an
effective
manner
at
least.
and
they
suggested
that
the
district
court
considered
all
of
the
evidence
and
then
determine,
in
his
best
judgment,
when
he
felt
that
such
a
climate
of
acceptance
might
be
foretold.
and
judge
lemley
declined
to
assume
that
first
responsibility,
and
in
his
statement
to
all
of
the
parties,
told
the
school
board
to
go
back
and
exercise
its
judgment,
which
he
felt
should
be
exercised
as
to
what
period
of
time
was
necessary
within
which
to
do
that.
and
that's
when
the
school
board
considering
the
time
required
for
various
state
statues
and
other
things
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
to
provide
some
reasonable
period
to
let
things
simmer
down,
concluded
that
two-and-a-half
years
was
the
proper
time.
now
the
first
consideration,
that
they
came
to
or
first
conclusion
was
that
it
might
work
better
and
i
believe
we
touched
on
that
point
at
the
last
hearing,
that
it
had
a
chance
of
working
better
at
mid
semester,
that
the
school
was
better
organized
at
that
time
and
school
officials
were
you
might
say
in
more
complete
charge
of
the
situation.
it
may
also
have
been
dictated
by
a
feeling,
well
it
certainly
didn't
work
in
september,
maybe
it'll
work
in
some
other
month
better,
but
they
had
a
good
reason
for
that.
now
that
was
the
reason
for
the
mid
term,
the
two
year,
additional
two
years
was
for
the
other
reasons
which
we
had
enumerated
which
--
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
is
our
conclusion
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
don't
feel
that
immediate
forceful
enforcement,
and
by
that
i
mean
by
troops
and
things
of
that
nature,
is
the
answer
at
this
time.
now
we
do
feel
that
somewhere
down
the
line,
there
should
be
adequate
enforcement
by
some
power
that
is
certainly
in
excess
of
any
power
that
the
school
board
has
to
maintain
peace.
but
in
our
best
judgment,
and
in
the
judgment
of
the
school
board
and
of
judge
lemley,
a
necessary
postponement
was
dictated
even
though
you
had
military
force
or
whatever,
that
some
additional
to
that
was
desirable
so
that
a
period
of
calm,
free
of
actual
turmoil,
a
period
if
you
please
when
people
in
the
community
were
not
forced
into
doing
something
immediately
and
precipitously,
but
to
give
them
time
to
feel
that
they
were
acquiescing
and
helping
to
solve
distressing
problems
which
are
on
the
minds
and
hearts
of
most
of
the
people
there.
the
disturbing
thing
about
--
one
of
the
disturbing
things
about
it
is
that
throughout
our
community
and
this
is
probably
true
in
many
other
communities,
people
are
more
and
more
at
this
point
going
into
the
extremes.
the
moderate
people
and
their
thinking
have
been
brushed
aside
for
the
moment.
the
school
board
feels
that
with
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
postponement
that
perhaps
that
--
those
extremes
views
on
either
side
can
be
overcome
by
the
calmer
period
people
within
--
and
between
those
two
extremes.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
don't
think
the
mere
passage
of
time
will
necessarily
do
it.
i
think
that
it
cannot
succeed
unless
there
is
some
reasonable
length
of
time
granted
for
it
to
have
an
opportunity
by
evolution
rather
than
revolution
to
come
into
fulfillment.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
a
matter
of
opinion
and
we
certainly
don't
say
that
that's
going
to
solve
all
of
the
problems
and
i
thoroughly
agree
with
you,
i
think
you
are
saying
about
same
thing
that
mere
delay
may
not
be
the
answer
but
we
cannot
see
any
sound
–-
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
just
say
this
that
the
first
thing
that
must
be
done
is
for
the
people
in
that
community
and
i
dare
say
in
other
communities
to
have
an
opportunity
free
of
things
such
as
troops
and
any
kind
of
military
show
of
force
that
that
is
the
primary
thing
that
must
be
done
at
this
time
to
postpone
it,
to
give
those
other
forces
a
chance.
now
we
don't
say
necessarily
that
all
problems
are
going
to
be
dispelled
into
thin
air
two-and-a-half
years
from
now,
that
has
never
been
our
position,
but
we
say
that
solutions
cannot
be
arrived
there,
proper
solutions
that
will
be
acceptable
by
enough
people
to
make
it
supportable
unless
such
a
delay
is
granted
and
we
have
hope
just
as
everyone
has
hoped
that
these
distressing
problems
can
at
least
partially
be
solved
if
a
reasonable
postponement
is
given.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
hadn't
planned
to
but
if
your
honor
requests
it,
i'll
be
glad.
i
have
some
comments
that
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
making.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir,
he
did
and
here
is
his
letter,
and
i
think
it
has
been
given
wide
publicity
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
might
--
yes
sir
and
i
might
suggest
reading
the
answer
which
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
not
been
given
any
publicity
by
the
president
of
the
school
board.
mr.
wayne
upton
received
the
letter
from
the
attorney
general
i
believe
on
september
the
9th
and
answered
it
the
same
day,
and
sent
me
a
copy
of
it
in
which
he
says,
“dear
mr.
rogers,
this
will
acknowledge
your
receipt
on
september
9
of
your
airmail
letter
of
september
7th
relating
to
the
problem
of
the
little
rock
school
board
in
the
event
that
immediate
integration
at
central
high
school
is
ordered
by
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
we
are
indeed
grateful
for
the
attitude
of
your
office
as
expressed
in
your
september
7
letter
and
you
maybe
assured
that
the
school
board
will
give
this
matter
its
careful
consideration
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment.
i
cannot
speak
for
the
board
being
only
one
of
six
members,
but
the
thinking
of
board
during
the
school
year
of
1957-58
was
that
criminal
prosecutions
would
have
been
more
helpful
in
solving
the
board's
problems
than
injunctive
relief.
since
ours
is
a
considerably
larger
community
than
either
hoxie
or
clinton
it
occurred
to
us
that
in
an
injunctive
order
directed
to
specific
individuals
would
not
necessarily
have
been
affective.
there
were
so
many
people
in
this
community
actively
opposed
to
integration
that
we
had
–
that
had
we
obtained
orders
of
injunction
against
the
known
leaders,
others
would
have
been
there
to
take
their
places.
it
seems
to
us
that
we
could
have
very
well
been
involved
in
an
almost
endless
effort
to
obtain
injunction.
moreover
for
a
great
portion
of
the
time
there
was
no
federal
judge
available
and
such
by
the
way
is
the
situation
at
the
present
time.
nevertheless
our
board
shares
with
you
the
interest
and
desire
to
arrive
at
a
peaceable
solution
of
the
problems
facing
us.
we
will
at
all
times
be
available
for
consultation
with
you
or
other
officers
of
the
department
of
justice.”
now
you
have
asked
for
my
observation
about
that
and
in
all
candor
i
will
tell
is
this.
we
feel
that
the
offer
from
the
attorney
general
comes
at
least
a
year
late.
our
second
observation
is
what
mr.
upton
pointed
out
that
the
school
board
should
not
be
put
in
the
position
of
seeking
injunctions
against
people
when
it
was
not
the
motivating
force
which
caused
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
make
these
decisions
in
the
brown
cases.
in
other
words
it
was
willing
to
comply
with
the
law
and
it
did
what
it
could
within
its
limited
power
to
do
that,
but
it
has
been
the
feeling
of
that
board
that
if
injunctive
relief
is
the
answer,
which
it
questioned,
then
such
injunctive
relief
should
come
through
the
cooperation
of
the
naacp
which
is
adequately
financed
and
certainly
ably
styled
and
the
attorney
general's
office
and
not
from
injunctive
relief
at
the
institution
of
the
school
board
itself.
now
that
is
partially
my
observation
but
i
think
it
pretty
generally
expresses
the
basic
feeling
of
this
board.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
i'd
like
to
make
this
comment
if
your
honor
please
that
for
at
least
the
last
three
months
this
school
board
has
been
so
involved
in
litigation
it
has
hardly
had
time
and
certainly
not
sufficient
energy
to
give
careful
consideration
to
any
of
these
possible
solutions
including
that
just
received
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
again
we
think
that
that
dictates
the
necessity
of
a
period
within
which
those
things
can
be
explored,
that
and
other
problems.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
i
think
mr.
justice
clark
first
thing
you
have
to
get
there
would
be
an
injunction
that's
the
problem.
you
have
an
injunction
then
you
have
a
citation
for
contempt
as
a
result
of
that
injunction
and
the
point
that
mr.
upton
was
making
i
believe
was
that
you'd
have
to
either
at
the
same
time
or
at
different
stages
obtain
injunctions
against
a
large
segment
of
the
community
and
you
don't
know
just
where
that
would
extend
to.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
it's
certainly
subject
to
a
citation
for
contempt
if
you
can
find
the
precise
persons
who
are
interfering
and
have
evidence
to
show
that
they
did
interfere
and
of
course
–-
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
of
course
that
is
one
of
the
problems
of
presenting
evidence.
and
i'd
like
to
say
at
this
point,
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
the
question,
we
--
we
have
not
been
critical
of
the
attitude
of
the
justice
department.
we
feel
that
that
everybody
connected
with
this
has
a
problem
and
i
might
say
that
it's
singular
to
me
that
there
has
been
as
little
criticism
of
the
forces
involved
who
are
actually
concerned
with
this.
we
have
no
criticism
of
their
position.
we
have
an
understanding
of
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
problems
has
been
that
and
i
think
it's
no
secret
so
expressed
by
various
persons
within
the
attorney
general's
office
that
members
of
the
staff
of
the
attorney
general
feel
that
there
are
not
adequate
federal
laws
with
which
they
can
deal
with
this
problem.
now
we
think
that
that's
what
prompted
the
attorney
general
about
a
year
ago
after
a
complete
fbi
report
which
we
have
never
seen
to
say
that
in
print
that
no
person
who
would
interfered
with
the
integration
plan
in
little
rock
would
be
prosecuted
by
the
office
of
the
department
of
justice
in
that
community.
now
i
hope
i
am
not
misunderstood
and
we
don't
want
to
be
appearing
in
a
position
of
being
critical
of
their
attitude.
we
are
understanding
of
it.
we
are
sympathetic
and
we
feel
very
earnestly
that
they
are
sympathetic
with
our
position
and
our
problems,
but
we
still
say
that
for
things
such
as
the
attorney
general
is
now
suggesting,
which
we
received
on
the
9th
that
some
delay
must
be
given
to
implement
that
suggestion
and
to
get
ready
for
it
and
to
try
to
prepare
for
it
and
solve
the
problems
that
are
presented
there.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
not
specifically
mr.
chief
justice,
we
--
the
board
came
to
this
rather
simple
conclusion
that
it
could
not
carry
on
an
educational
process
effectively
under
those
circumstances.
it
felt
that
in
order
to
give
any
kind
of
solution
a
chance
that
it
must
have
a
delay
and
largely
that
evidence
which
was
presented
to
judge
lemley
over
a
period
of
some
three
days
was
to
give
him
a
history
so
that
he
could
exercise
his
judicial
discretion
as
to
what
to
do
and
the
evidence
that
was
presented
there
simply
showed
the
breakdown
as
a
result
of
obstacles
which
were
completely
beyond
the
control
of
that
school
board,
that
were
destroying
the
educational
system.
now
that's
what
--
and
the
school
board
felt
and
obviously
judge
lemley
felt
that,
that
under
the
brown
decision
was
within
his
sphere
of
exercising
his
judicial
discretion
in
giving
what
the
board
asked
for.
now
we
didn't
get
into
that
lawsuit
as
to
all
of
the
possible
suggestions
as
to
what
might
be
done.
we
felt
that
the
period
of
time
to
be
granted
by
the
trial
judge;
that,
that
was
the
time
after
feelings
simmered
down
some,
to
explore
these
various
things
and
to
get
ready,
whatever
course
might
take,
so
that
adequate
preparation
would
be
forthcoming.
and
not
have
to
make
decisions
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
let
me
state
it
this
way
mr.
justice
black,
here
is
the
position
we
take.
this
conflict
has
resolved
itself
as
we
see
it
as
a
school
board
into
a
head
on
collision
between
the
federal
and
state
governments.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no
sir,
but
that
conflict
insofar
as
the
executives
of
those
two
sovereignties
is
concerned,
must
be
resolved
and
this
school
board
can't
resolve
it.
now,
the
school
board
feels
that
until
that
conflict
is
resolved
that
it
is
helpless
to
carry
on
an
effective
educational
system,
and
they
are
asking
for
time
for
that
conflict
in
all
of
its
ramifications
to
be
resolved
so
that
they
can
then,
whatever
the
resolutions
maybe
on
what
might
be
termed
an
upper
level,
they
can
be
guided
by
the
resolution
of
those
conflicts
and
formulate
plans
within
the
framework
of
those
solutions.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
sir
i
think
it's
possible
that
this
conflict
could
be
resolved
without
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
without
an
immediate
court
order
requiring
the
school
board
to
proceed
forthwith,
yes
sir
i
think
there
is
hope
of
that.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
you're
not
going
to
change
the
opposition
of
the
majority
of
the
people
of
arkansas
who
are
opposed
to
integration
of
the
races
in
the
public
schools
in
two-and-a-half
years
in
my
opinion,
but
i
think
it
is
entirely
likely
that
within
such
a
period
of
time,
the
people
of
the
state
of
arkansas
will
no
longer,
or
any
large
segment
of,
any
uncontrollable
segment
of
them,
be
put
in
--
justifiably
be
put
in
the
category
of
law
defiers
and
mob
formers
and
people
of
that
category.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well
the
first
part
of
that
certainly
is
accurate
and
i
think
it's
implicit
in
us
being
here
that
we
feel
that
this
is
a
problem
which
this
court
must
deal
with
and
again
i
say
though
that
the
conclusion
of
our
school
board
and
of
our
local
district
judge
was
that
of
that
the
problems
in
little
rock
arkansas
as
distinguished
from
other
related
problems
or
dissimilar
problems
in
other
states,
that
a
time
for
a
cooling
off
period
was
in
order
and
it
was
the
only
hope
of
arriving
at
suitable
solutions
that
would
be
acceptable
both
to
courts
and
to
the
majority
of
the
people
in
that
area
and
in
areas
similarly
situated
with
similar
problems.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
your
honor,
you
have
said
it
so
much
better
and
so
much
more
accurately
and
so
much
more
concisely
that
i
could
adopt
it
wholeheartedly
and
that
is
exactly
my
personal
feeling
and
i
believe
it
is
the
feeling
of
the
school
board
as
an
organization.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
seek
clarification,
but
we
say
to
make
that
clarification
effective
and
to
keep
our
public
school
system
intact,
we
must
also
have
a
delay
to
do
it.
if
i
may
use
a
homely
illustration,
it
occurs
to
me
that
it's
just
about
like
this.
some
man
comes
up
with
a
gun
in
your
back,
and
he
orders
you
to
do
something
that
maybe
you
ought
to
do,
but
as
long
as
he
has
that
gun
in
your
back,
he's
going
to
try
to
find
someway
to
turn
around
quickly
and
take
that
gun
away
and
is
going
to
amount
in
the
long
run
to
a
particular
conflict
between
those
two
people.
whereas
if
you
remove
the
gun
and
tempers
have
a
chance
to
simmer
down,
the
man
at
whose
back
the
gun
is
being
pointed
may
see
the
advisability
of
following
the
course
which
the
man
behind
him
had
advocated
all
along,
but
in
a
spirit
of
conciliation,
in
a
spirit
of
patriotism
if
you
please,
he
will
come
nearer
doing
the
thing
without
injury
to
either
party,
if
he
is
given
time
within
which
to
appraise
it
in
a
judicial
manner,
and
in
a
slow
manner,
in
a
manner
with
deliberate
speed
if
you
please
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
we
insist
upon
any
period
of
time
which
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes
a
postponement
of
it,
yes
sir
we
do.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
we
are
to
read
the
newspaper
reports
accurately;
it
appears
that
the
government
of
arkansas
has
stated
that
he
would
again
call
out
the
national
guard
if
he
felt
that
it
became
necessary
to
maintain
law
and
order.
the
last
time
that
he
did
that
course
under
this
stated
purpose,
he
issued
orders
to
keep
the
children
out
of
the
school.
if
that
is
accurate,
he
says
he
will
do
that
again
and
then
the
president
of
the
united
states
if
we
are
further
to
read
the
news
reports
accurately,
he
said
that
he
would
call
the
national
guard
and
then
federalize
it
in
order
to
prevent
the
court
orders
from
being
nullified
or
ineffective
or
interfered
with.
now,
these
executives
carry
out
their
stated
plans
and
obviously,
central
high
school
will
again
have
troops
and
if
it's
true
that
the
education
processes
cannot
effectively
be
carried
on
with
troops
patrolling
the
grounds
and
the
buildings,
then
action
of
this
court
if
it
affirms
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
will
by
all
logic
and
reason
seriously
impair,
if
not,
virtually
destroy
the
full
potential
of
a
high
school
education
for
those
children
at
that
time.
now,
in
one
of
the
briefs
amicus
curiae,
this
statement
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
all
right,
sir.
well,
if
this
--
this
statement
which
i
have
pondered
and
i'm
sure
it
presents
a
problem
to
this
court.
this
statement
is
made
that
no
court
in
history
has
attempted
to
enjoin
50
million
people.
now,
the
author
of
course,
i
presume
was
not
referring
to
arkansas
alone
of
course,
but
approximately
where
there
are
some
two
million
people.
but
to
that
vast
area
which
comprises
some
12
states
that's
usually
referred
to
the
south.
the
area,
if
you
please,
referred
to
by
one
of
the
justices
as
he
amply
observed
that
national
policy
might
not
be
the
same
in
little
rock,
arkansas
as
it
is
in
pittsfield,
massachusetts.
the
point
that
i
get
from
--
form
that
comment
that
no
court
in
history
has
ever
attempted
to
enjoin
50
million
people.
it
points
up
simply
the
school
board's
position
that
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
go
out
with
their
very
limited
facilities
and
--
and
seek
injunctions
against
an
entire
province
and
if
--
and
it
--
it's
emphasized
in
this
quotation
that
it's
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice
holmes,
some
years
ago
in
the
case
of
giles
versus
harris,
which
we
quote
on
page
33
of
our
brief.
the
substance
of
it
is
simply
this.
you
will
recall
that
the
case
involved
the
registration
of
negro
voters
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
mr.
justice
holmes
made
this
observation.
he's
talking
about
the
state
not
being
a
technical
party
to
the
sue,
but
he
says,
“and
if
we
leave
the
state
out
of
consideration,
the
court
has
its
little
practical
power
to
deal
with
the
people
of
the
state
in
abiding.”
in
other
words,
he
was
saying
even
though
the
state
isn't
a
party
to
it,
if
the
people
of
the
state
which
actually
are
the
state,
oppose
something
in
mass
as
very
little
in
a
court
of
equity
can
do
to
remedy
that
particular
situation,
unless
it
is
implemented
in
other
ways.
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
if
the
conspiracy
and
intent
exist.
the
name
on
a
piece
of
paper
will
not
defeat
them
unless
we
are
prepared
to
supervise
the
voting
in
that
state
by
officers
of
this
court.
it
seems
to
us
that
all
that
the
plaintiff
could
get
from
equity
would
be
an
empty
form.
and
then,
he
ends
up
by
this
which
we
have
supplied
emphasis
to
in
our
brief,
a
part
from
damages
to
the
individual,
relief
from
a
great
political
wrong,
if
done,
as
alleged
by
the
people
of
the
state
and
the
state
itself
must
be
given
by
them
or
by
the
legislature
and
the
political
department
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
he
was
just
pointing
out
around
the
practical
problems.
now,
if
we
see
the
issue
in
this
and
i
--
even
though
this
is
repetition,
i
think
it
bears
repeating
that
the
issue
as
we
see
it
and
distinguished
from
the
issue
as
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
we
think
is
not
the
issue
in
this
particular
case.
here's
why
we
see
the
issue.can
a
court
of
equity
postpone
the
enforcement
of
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights
if
the
immediate
enforcements
thereof
will
deprive
many
others
of
their
constitutional
rights
to
an
education
in
a
free
public
school?
this
court
as
well
as
other
courts
dealing
with
this
disturbing
problem
and
in
fact
counsel
for
naacp
joins
with
courts
in
recognizing
that
in
a
situation
such
as
faces
this
court
today,
equities
must
be
balanced.
and
as
counsel
has
said,
“the
irreparable
harm
on
the
one
side
as
against
the
harm
on
the
others,”
and
we
submit
that
if
the
equities
of
the
school
children
in
little
rock
are
the
equities
that
are
to
be
good
--
to
be
given
consideration
or
among
those
--
then
we
submit
that
the
scales
weighed
down
heavily
in
their
favor
and
in
favor
of
the
relief
which
the
district
court
gave
to
the
school
board.
i'd
like
to
adopt
also
a
statement
which
seems
to
me
to
be
(inaudible)
from
the
brief
which
was
submitted
by
the
honorable
j.w.fullbright,
the
distinguished
senator
from
arkansas
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
this
is
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
this
is
--
this,
we
adopt
is
part
of
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
we
have
adopted
this
as
part
of
our
argument
and
it's
a
quotation.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
this
question
seems
to
be
appropriate
to
us.
is
it
not
the
province
of
equity
to
which
this
court
was
committed
by
the
second
brown
decision
to
adopt
its
statement
of
constitutional
principles
to
the
purposes,
functions
and
abilities
of
the
institutions
to
which
those
principles
are
certainly
to
apply.
that
is
the
public
school
systems
in
the
south
and
particularly
in
our
case
to
little
rock.
what
indeed
is
the
purpose
of
entrusting
equitable
jurisdiction
to
local
federal
district
courts,
if
it
is
not
to
permit
an
appraisal
of
what
can
be
done
to
comply
with
the
orders
of
this
court
in
the
light
of
good
faith,
efforts
of
local
school
boards?
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
majority
seems
to
have
been
cognizant
only
of
the
violent
and
unlawful
acts
of
individual
citizens
and
groups
and
did
not
give
proper
way
to
the
equitable
nature
of
the
proceeding.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
failed
to
recognize
that
there
was
involve
not
simply
the
violence
of
individual
citizens,
but
the
conflict
of
two
sovereignties,
the
state
and
federal
government.
this
conflict
poses
problems
which
go
far
beyond
in
a
quite
different
problem,
the
problems
dealing
with
lawless
mobs.
they
are
problems
which
are
not
readily
solved
by
federal
injunctions
in
our
opinion.
one
of
the
essential
issues
is
the
refusal
of
a
state
government
to
accept
the
validity
of
a
federal
court
decision
as
being
a
law.
the
realities
are
that
due
to
an
unexpected
and
unprecedented
development,
this
court's
original
objective
of
procuring
for
negro
children,
education
on
an
integrated
basis
cannot
be
provided
under
existing
circumstances,
unless
one
subscribes
to
the
theory
that
an
educational
process
can
be
carried
on
effectively,
while
troops
are
the
equivalent
or
in
the
--
on
the
school
premises.
time
is
desperately
needed
to
enable
us
and
enable
persons
in
authority
to
find
an
adjustment
of
this
distressing
conflict.
no
decision
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
and
the
corridors.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
there
was
one
bit
of
evidence.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
think
that
was
generally
true,
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
there
was
one
reference
in
--
in
some
witness,
teacher's
testimony
and
i
believe
judge
lemley
referred
to
it
and
that
was
that
in
patrolling
the
halls,
there
were
glass
doors
and
children
in
the
classroom
would
see
soldiers
going
up
and
down
the
corridors
and
that
that
was
destructing
influence
and
i
think
--
and
--
and
that's
why
i
had
reference
to.
i
know
that
that
was
in
the
evidence
and
i
believe
that
it
was
mentioned
in
--
in
judge
lemley's
opinion,
although
i
cannot
be
certain
of
that.
no
decision
which
this
court
can
make
will
assure
the
rights
the
negro
children
more
effectively
than
those
decisions
which
are
as
heretofore
rendered.
in
spite
of
the
full
force
of
the
executive
power
of
the
federal
government,
even
the
use
of
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
children
did
not
and
cannot
enjoy
it
better,
we
think
not
even
as
good
an
opportunity
for
education
under
conditions
of
turmoil
which
result
from
such
extreme
measures.
and
of
course,
the
education
of
all
children,
negro
and
white
suffer
when
such
conditions
exist.
we
believe
that
the
argument
that
to
accept
the
decision
of
the
district
court
for
two
and
a
half
year
delay
is
an
abandonment
of
the
integration
decision
of
this
court
is
without
merits.
such
an
argument
takes
no
account
of
the
difference
between
the
annunciation
of
the
constitutional
doctrine
and
the
application
of
that
doctrine
through
the
principals
of
equity.
more
importantly,
it
takes
no
account
of
the
obligation
of
the
courts
to
adopt
their
powers
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
institution
or
activity
are
affected
by
this
powers
exist.
this
court
has
stated
that
courts
of
equity
may
and
frequently
do
go
much
farther,
both
to
give
or
withhold
relief
in
furtherance
of
the
public
interest
than
they
are
accustomed
to
go
when
only
private
rights
are
involved.
i
believe
we
cite
a
case
to
that
effect
in
our
brief.
the
processes
of
public
education
in
this
country
offer
the
solution,
if
any
is
to
be
found
whereby
men
of
different
races
may
learn
to
abide
one
another
and
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
their
rights.
if
this
is
agreed,
then
the
systems
of
education
must
be
respected
and
preserved
and
social
experimentation
in
there
made
tolerable
to
their
purposes.
one
other
point
that
we
feel
that
perhaps
it's
justified
for
this
court
to
take
into
consideration
because
after
all
it
is
the
top
court
of
equity
and
expects
the
lower
courts
and
itself
to
do
equity
when
equitable
principles
are
involved
and
we
simply
pose
this
question.
it
can
be
expected
that
the
control
of
local
school
boards
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
radicals
and
fanatics.
in
which
event,
neither
the
processes
of
justice
or
education
would
be
served,
unless
some
reasonable
delay
is
given
in
this
case.
now,
we
pose
that
as
a
question
and
we
also
believe
that
it
has
merit
as
argument.
now,
in
the
final
analysis,
this
court
being
a
court
of
equity,
of
course
it
has
the
power
to
do
whatever
it
feels,
considering
the
entire
record
and
all
of
the
factors
involved
is
the
proper
and
right
thing
to
do.
we
again
plead
for
the
opportunity
to
preserve
our
public
education
system
and
that
is
our
primary
plea.
in
the
best
judgment
of
the
school
board,
it
has
a
chance
of
survival
so
as
to
give
effective
education
to
the
children,
only
if
some
reasonable
delay
is
given,
whether
that
delay
should
be
six
months,
whether
it
should
be
two
weeks,
whether
it
should
be
a
year,
whether
it
should
be
two
years,
it's
certainly
a
matter
of
opinion
and
judgment.
i
say
again
that
it
was
the
earnest
belief,
the
well-considered
judgment
of
the
school
board
that
it
had
the
best
chance
of
arriving
at
solutions
to
these
distressing
problems
if
it
were
given
the
period
of
time
within
which
to
work
those
out
and
which
time
was
approved
by
the
federal
district
judge
in
his
judicial
discretion.
now,
we
do
not
say
that
that
is
the
only
time.
no
one
can
say
that
that
is
the
precise
time
when
this
can
be
solved.
it
maybe,
that
in
this
court's
judgment,
six
months
maybe
long
enough.
it
maybe
a
year
will
be
long
enough.
that
again
is
a
matter
of
equity
to
determine,
but
the
case
is
before
you
on
the
basis
of
what
the
school
board
felt
was
the
shortest
period
of
time
or
the
best
period
of
time
within
which
these
solutions
could
be
final.
we
have
described
the
situation
where
the
school
board,
a
creature
of
the
state
is
placed
between
the
millstones
and
a
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
courts.
we
believe
that
we
have
pointed
out
the
absurdity
of
the
premise
that
the
school
district
should
keep
the
peace.
we
think
that
that
is
an
incredible
argument
which
does
not
deserve
mush
attention.
it
is
obvious
that
the
school
board
has
no
police
powers
as
such.we
say
again
that
the
problem
which
we
feel
has
not
yet
been
grasped
by
the
respondents
and
the
solicitor
general
and
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
there
are
two
elements
which
must
be
present
in
this
situation.
first,
that
a
plan
of
desegregation,
that's
the
first
plan.
this
board
has
had
that
plan
and
this,
the
district
formulated
several
years
ago
and
tried
in
good
faith
to
put
into
operation.
second,
that
a
plan
of
adequate
enforcement
in
a
word,
there
has
been
despite
pleas
to
the
department
of
justice
by
school
officials
and
by
the
respondents.
again,
we
say
we're
not
being
critical
of
that
department,
but
they
have
not
come
forth
until
recently
with
the
suggestion
of
this
kind
and
their
hands
have
been
tied,
we
feel,
to
engage
in
criminal
prosecutions
where
some
were
possibly
indicated.
since
these
dual
plans
are
required
and
only
one
is
in
existence
at
this
time,
the
least
relief
that
the
school
district
should
have
is
a
stay
of
the
plan
of
desegregation
until
the
district
court
is
satisfied
that
a
plan
of
enforcement
is
in
operation
and
is
efficient
to
ensure
an
adequate
educational
program
and
an
educational
climate
during
the
operation
of
the
plan
of
desegregation.
this
may
take
two
weeks.
it
may
take
two
years,
but
until
an
adequate
enforcement
is
an
actuality,
the
plan
of
desegregation
will
be
effective
only
to
wreak
havoc
upon
our
school
system.
and
this
court,
as
a
court
of
equity,
we
feel
should
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
tell
that
court
that
when
and
if
the
conflict
between
the
sovereignties
is
settled
and
when
an
effective
plan
of
enforcement,
so
that
the
school
system
can
function,
is
presented
and
appears
to
the
district
court
to
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
success,
that
until
such
time,
the
school
board
should
be
given
a
postponement
of
its
plan.
and
we
feel
that
this
court
as
a
court
of
equity,
of
course
has
with
in
its
power
to
do
that.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
there
are
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
respond
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
regard
of
what
counsel
for
opponents
has
stated.
first,
i
would
like
to
comment
that
there
is
not
much
doubt,
although
there
maybe
more
than
i
suspect
as
to
what
lawyers
as
distinguished
from
the
great
mass
of
people
think
the
law
to
be.
i
think
that
virtually,
every
lawyer
that
has
studied
constitutional
law
in
any
manner
recognizes
as
the
school
board
recognizes
as
--
and
his
counsel
for
the
school
board
recognizes
that
the
federal
law
is
supreme
and
if
you
do
have
a
conflict
between
the
two,
then
of
course
state
law
or
constitutions
must
give
way.
the
point
that
we
have
made
all
along
is
that
when
you
have
responsible
public
officials,
columnists
and
various
other
people
in
whom
a
populist
has
confidence
telling
them
differences
of
opinion
about
it,
it
creates
in
the
minds
of
those
people
some
question
as
to
what
the
law
and
not
necessarily
in
the
minds
of
lawyers,
but
in
the
minds
of
the
great
mass
of
people
and
in
the
minds
of
people
who
are
i
say
again
not
basically
law
violators.
now,
counsel
has
commented
on
the
equities
in
the
situation
and
of
course
we
feel
that
in
the
brown
decision,
this
court
disposed
of
that.
it
recognized
that
there
are
equities
in
it
that
must
be
weighed,
public
and
private
rights.
when
the
court
said,
because
of
their
proximity
to
local
conditions
and
the
need
for
further
hearings,
the
courts
which
originally
heard
these
cases
can
best
perform
this
judicial
appraisal.
accordingly,
we
believe
it's
appropriate
to
remand
the
cases
to
those
courts
in
fashioning
and
effectuating
the
decrees.
the
courts
will
be
guided
by
equitable
principles.
traditionally,
equity
has
been
characterized
by
practical
flexibility
in
shaping
its
remedies
and
by
a
facility
for
adjusting
and
reconciling
public
and
private
needs.
these
cases
call
for
the
exercise
of
these
traditional
attributes
of
equity
power.
now,
if
the
record
is
in
conflict
as
counsel
states,
there
was
not
much
conflict
about
the
evidence
produced.
but
whatever
the
conflict
may
have
been,
we
believe
that
those
are
issues
of
fact
that
have
been
resolved
by
the
trial
court
without
any
successful
attack.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
didn't
realize
that
there
was
any
real
dispute
about
the
evidence,
the
basic
evidence
of
the
problems
and
obstacles
that
confronted
the
school
board.
we
repeat
again
just
posing
the
question
for
this
court
that
if
you
in
effect
drive
the
school
board
out
of
office
than
other
school
boards
with
less
moderate
views
with
considerably
less
determination
to
follow
the
law
will
be
replaced
thereby.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no,
sir.
so
far
as
i
know,
resignation
is
not
in
contemplation.
effective
administration
of
the
school
system
by
the
school
board
is
in
jeopardy
because
the
special
session
of
the
legislature
of
arkansas
has
virtually
turned
that
administration
over
to
the
governor
if
he
signs
this.
now,
counsel
again
states
that
the
school
board
should
do
this
or
that.
they
should
ask
the
court's
assistance.
the
school
board
has
always
every
major
crisis
that
has
come
up,
there
had
been
many
minor
ones,
but
every
major
crisis,
the
school
board
has
gone
to
the
court
and
asked
for
instructions
and
tried
to
get
instructions
from
the
courts.
now,
it's
had
some
practical
problem
there
because
as
we
pointed
out,
as
mr.
(inaudible)
pointed
out,
there
has
not
been
a
regularly
sitting
district
judge
there
for
quite
some
time.
that
has
posed
a
--
a
very
practical
problem.
there's
always
been
some
court.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
you
couldn't
drive
200
miles
or
100
miles
or
150
miles
and
not
find
a
judge,
but
to
have
one
right
there
in
little
rock
when
these
questions
and
problems
come
up
quickly.
there
has
not
been
one
available
at
times
and
we
suggest
what
is
to
keep
the
naacp,
which
is
the
organization
that
really
sponsored
the
litigation
before
this
court
which
prompted
this
court,
urged
this
court
to
change
a
doctrine
of
the
law
that
had
been
in
existence
and
recognized
by
this
court
by
some
58
years.
what
is
to
keep
that
organization
from
going
to
the
federal
district
judge?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no,
sir,
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
laws.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
statute
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
that
--
as
i
recall,
that
was
one
of
the
acts
that
was
not
sponsored
by
the
governor.
i
think
that
was
written
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
but
i
don't
believe
i
followed
your
question,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
that
act
that
he
has
read
does
attempt
to
throw
obstacles
in
the
way.
now,
when
i
speak
of
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
when
i
--
when
i
speak
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
when
i
speak
of
the
naacp,
i
really
incorporate
within
that
group
any
individual
litigants
who
claim
that
their
rights
are
being
--
that
they're
being
deprived
of
those
rights.
i
don't
mean
as
an
organization
necessarily,
i
mean
--
i
mean
the
legal
staff
which
it
has
that
is
disposal,
the
legal
staff
of
the
individual
litigants,
whether
they
be
prompted
by
the
organization
or
as
individual
litigants.
they
can
go
into
court.
they've
been
in
the
case
at
the
same
length
of
time
that
the
school
board
had
because
they
sued
the
school
board
to
start
out
with.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
the
intent
was
to
make
it
illegal
for
a
lawyer
representing
an
individual
litigant
to
appear
in
court.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
i
think
it
was
directed
to
restrict
the
activities,
generally
of
a
number
of
organizations
probably
including
the
naacp.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
you
honor,
that
was
one
of
the
acts
which
was
passed
about
two
weeks
ago
in
which
it
has
not
yet
been
signed
by
the
governor.
there
is
some
--
there
is
more
doubt
in
the
minds
of
most
people
that
he
will
sign
that
law
than
he
will
on
one
of
the
others
because
if
--
if
my
information
is
correct,
he
did
not
sponsor
that
bill
through
the
legislation.
that
was
not
one
of
the
six
laws
that
he
sponsored.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
i
think
i'm
correct
in
that.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
he
hasn't
yet.
we
have
not
been
taken
into
his
confidence
as
to
what
intends
to
do
in
the
future.
now,
one
last
thing
that
i
didn't
cover
in
our
principal
argument
and
that
is
that
so
far
as
we
know
and
so
far
as
within
the
power
of
this
school
board,
if
this
court
orders
at
any
time
whether
it
would
be
monday
or
whether
it
be
at
midterm
or
whether
it'd
be
next
spring,
so
far
as
the
administration
of
the
school
is
concerned
at
the
present
time,
not
taking
into
consideration
what
laws
might
be
signed
or
put
into
effect.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that,
but
at
least
as
of
this
time,
there
is
no
administrative
obstacle
of
the
school
board
that
would
keep
the
present
negro
children
from
being
transferred
from
the
all
negro
horace
mann
school
back
over
to
central
high
school.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
questions
asked
by
some
of
the
justices
at
this
hearing
and
more
particularly
at
the
previous
hearing
were
concerned
about
that.
now,
in
making
that
statement,
we
should
emphasize
again
that
there
are
many
things
over
which
the
school
board
has
no
control.
but
as
of
the
present
time,
there
is
no
administrative
obstacle
of
the
school
board
that
would
prohibit
those
children,
anyone
or
more
of
them
from
being
changed
from
one
school
to
another.
that
is
a
process
that
is
done
in
a
limited
way
throughout
the
school
year
on
occasions
where
circumstances
dictate
that
it
should
be
done.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
i
said
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
i
think
it
will
for
a
few
days
to
see
whether
or
not
the
governor
signs
these
bills
because
there
are
some
bills
in
there
that
for
all
practical
purposes
take
the
administration
of
the
school
system
in
little
rock
away
from
this
board.
now,
if
it
is
taken
away
from
the
board
completely,
they
may
have
no
alternative.
the
point
i'm
making
is
and
i
believe
--
i
believe
it
was
your
honor
that
asked
me
that
last
time
or
perhaps
mr.
justice
clark
as
to
whether
or
not
school
children
were
ever
transferred
from
one
school
to
another
during
the
school
year.
and
i
wanted
to
emphasize
that
that
is
not
an
unusual
thing.
it's
done
all
the
time
for
various
reasons
and
there
is
no
fixed
rule
in
the
little
rock
school
system
that
just
because
you
are
registered
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
one
school,
absolutely
requires
you
to
stay
there
the
balance
of
the
year.
there
is
no
such
fixed
term
policy.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
--
that
is
my
opinion
of
that
particular
bill,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
rankin
has
told
the
court
what
he
thinks
the
court
has
said.
i'll
try
to
limit
my
remarks
by
merely
reading
excerpts
from
the
decisions.
in
solving
it
down,
it's
simply
that
equitable
principles
should
apply
and
that
the
local
district
court
should
apply
those
flexible
equity
principles.
the
honorable
solicitor
general
says
that
only
in
cases
where
there
is
proof
to
show
a
cause
for
delay
should
delays
be
granted.
we
submit,
your
honors
that
this
record
is
replete
with
reasons
for
delay
and
we
rest
our
case
on
those
reasons
i
set
forth
in
judge
lemley's
decision.
he
further
comments
that
there
are
places
in
the
deep
south
where
integration
has
worked
successfully.
what
to
me
is
the
deep
south,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
places
where
such
a
process
is
successfully
being
carried
on
and
i
don't
want
to
labor
the
point,
but
he
does
raise
an
interesting
comment,
it
seems
to
me
and
that
is
--
will
this
court
forthwith
virtually
destroy
the
school
board
and
has
tried
to
do
its
duty
when
places
throughout
what
i
call
the
deep
south
at
least
have
made
no
apparent
effort
even
to
formulate
a
plan.
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
proper
argument
in
this
case,
but
the
solicitor
general
has
posed
a
question
and
i
think
it
is
a
question
that
this
court
must
deal
with.
now,
the
honorable
solicitor
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
well,
perhaps
my
words
were
not
chosen
well,
mr.
justice
douglas.
it's
--
it's
a
conflict
that
it
is
probably
destroying
as
i
see
it.
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
--
i
think
the
--
in
all
candor,
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
problem
grew
up
by
a
change
of
the
law
of
this
court.
now,
that's
my
very
candid
opinion
about
it.
i
think
all
of
this
conflict
would
not
have
resulted,
except
for
the
brown
decision.
at
least
there
wouldn't
have
been
the
(inaudible)
about
it.
now,
we're
not
arguing
that
point
and
we
are
respectfully
tried
to
stay
off
of
it,
but
that
is
my
candid
opinion.
now,
as
to
--
and
--
and
i
hope
i
will
not
be
taken
as
appearing
fictitious
because
i
don't
intend
to
be.
but
the
honorable
solicitor
general
has
says
that
there
is
nothing
to
discuss,
the
way
he
puts
it
about
there
being
a
conflict
between
two
sovereignties.
well
now,
the
school
board
has
been
under
the
impression
that
there
has
been
such
a
conflict,
the
result
of
which
caused
troops
to
be
within
the
area
under
one
commander
and
a
day
or
two
later,
under
another.
now,
if
that
isn't
a
conflict
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
sovereign,
i'm
not
aware
of
what
could
be.
the
honorable
solicitor
general
refers
to
the
court
provisions
that
the
federal
law
is
supreme
and
of
course
as
i
said
before,
all
lawyers
recognize
that,
but
one
of
the
basic
problems,
there
are
some
students
of
the
constitution
who
have
read
other
provisions
such
as
the
one
that
says
that,
“rights
not
specifically
delegated
to
the
federal
government
shall
be
reserved
to
the
states
or
to
the
people.”
now,
a
good
many
people,
not
only
in
the
south
have
been
reading
that
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
and
have
gotten
alarm
about
the
disregard
of
it.
now,
he
says
also
that
the
school
board
should
use
all
of
the
powers
if
they
have
to
--
mr.
richard
c.
butler
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
only
because
the
solicitor
general
raised
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
says
that
the
school
board
should
use
all
of
the
power
they
have
to
the
outmost
and
i
take
it
that
his
argument
is
implicit
or
carries
implicitly
in
it
that
he
expects
them
to
go
over
the
brink
of
the
chasm
into
destruction,
or
as
the
in
case
of
(inaudible),
that
the
law
must
be
held
--
upheld
even
to
the
destruction
of
the
republic.
now,
the
school
board
cannot
separate
itself.
it's
true,
as
pointed
out
by
the
honorable
solicitor
general,
but
the
prospect
of
this
board
is
if
the
state
will
separate
it
from
its
function
and
that's
what
one
of
their
problems
that
we
have
involved
in
this.
now,
the
school
board,
according
to
the
solicitor
general,
should
try
to
educate
the
people.
i'm
not
sure
that
this
record
will
show
it.
i
believe
it
will
in
judge
lemyley's
opinion,
but
the
fact
is
and
it's
undisputed
that
the
superintendent
of
schools
and
other
members
of
the
school
board
or
--
or
members
of
the
school
board,
he
is
not
actually
a
member,
went
through
the
community
of
little
rock
for
at
least
a
solid
year
after
the
first
brown
decision.
i
think
i'm
correct
in
saying
that
in
over
a
period
of
at
least
two
years,
he
and
others
explained
the
plan,
explained
to
the
people
of
the
area
that
in
their
--
that
this
had
to
be
done
in
some
form
and
if
this
was
a
plan
that
the
school
board
had
felt
was
workable.
now,
that
was
done
and
it
was
done
to
the
very
best
ability
of
that
school
superintendent
and
that
school
board.
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
mr.
blossom
appeared
some
250
times
over
a
period
of
time
in
various
groups,
both
in
his
office
and
in
the
public
forum,
trying
to
educate
the
people
of
that
area
as
to
the
distressing
problem
and
the
probable
solutions
of
it.
and
he
and
the
school
board
felt
that
they
had
at
least
the
acquiescence
of
the
people
of
that
community.
that
obviously
turned
out
to
be
an
error
in
judgment.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
yes,
sir,
approximately
there,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
richard
c.
butler
that
was
the
day
of
the
beginning.
i
would
not
say
that
that
action
by
the
governor
was
actually
the
first
or
the
very
beginning
of
obvious
determined
opposition
to
this
plan.
that
was
smouldering
and
came
out
during
the
summer
of
1957
and
i
would
say
culminated
in
the
action
of
the
government.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
that
have
different
opinions
about
what
caused
what,
what's
the
cause
and
what's
the
result.
the
actual
sequence
of
events
was
that
there
were
some
outspoken
opposition.
there
was
outspoken
opposition
by
various
people
during
the
summer
of
1957
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
or
thereabouts
in
september
of
1957
the
governor
did
call
out
the
troops.
thank
you
very
much.
