was
the
argument
displayed?

(inaudible),
is
it
not?
justice

do
you

system
of

mr.

if
you
were
to
assume
that
the
court
had
not
issued
a
stay
and
that
the
(inaudible)
argument
by
an
order
came
down
approving
a
plan
and
requiring
integration,
would
it
be
feasible
or
practical
within
the
practice
of
the
school
board
in
keeping
with
the
order
of
the
court
if
such
an
order
was
entered
and
then
transfer
the
students
if
is
so
ordered
from
whatever
school
they
were
in
to
an
integrated
school
or
would
you
have

wait
a
year
as
mr.
justice
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
we
heard
the
case
on
the
merits
rather
than
passing
on
the
stays,
they
would
just
say
the
court
didn't
pass
on
the
stay
at
all,
just
referred
the
case
on
the
merits
in
a
later
date
and
the
judgment
was
against
you,
then
there
would
be
no
reason
that
you
knew
of
why
the
school
board
could
not
at
that
time
transfer
the
students
from
whatever
school
they
were
in
to
a
integrated
school.
