in

the

first
the

mr.

we
will
now
entertain
a
motion
to
admit
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
any
the
associate
that
you
may
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
should
you
wish
--
should
you
wish
later
mr.
butler
to
have
either
of
these
gentlemen
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
will
be
very
glad
to
hear
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
two
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
we
have
two,
two
motions
of
that
kind
which
will
be
taken
care
of
in
due
course.
number

miscellaneous
john
aaron
et
al.
petitioners,
versus
william
g.
cooper
et
al,
members
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
little
rock
arkansas
independent
school
district,
and
virgil
t.
blossom,
superintendent
of
schools.
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
discussed
with
counsel
on
the
other
side
the
possibility
or
the
propriety
of
arguing
the
merits
here
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
mr.
marshall,
i
can
see
where
you
would
be
interested
in
having
both
points
raised
by
you
decided,
both
the
stay
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
a
stay
of
the
opinion
below
in
the
district
court,
but
if
this
court
should
see
fit
to
stay
the
district
court
of
opinion,
would
it
then
be
necessary
to
also
overrule
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
stay
of
the
mandate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
proprietary
of
this
stay
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
fully?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
time
expired
for
constitution
for
rehearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
in
view
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
overruling
judge
lemley,
is
the
school
board
acting
under
any
compulsion
to
desegregate
this
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
has
the
school
board
determined
what
it
will
do
toward
desegregation
or
toward
leaving
the
matter
as
it
was
last
year
in
the
event
this
court
declines
to
grant
this
stay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
as
to
these
specific
children,
have
they
been
assigned
to
any
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
not
been.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
that,
isn't
that
action
towards
segregating
them
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
then
my
point
is
this.
if
this
court
does
not
stay
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
withholding
its
mandate
then
the
school
board
will
proceed
to
segregate
these
pupils
who
are
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
only
point
was
this
mr.
butler
if
this
court
does
not
grant
a
stay
to
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
it
the
purpose
of
the
school
board
to
assign
these
youngsters
involved
in
this
case
to
an
all-negro
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
whites
to
white
schools
and
negroes
to
negro
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
ever
transferred
--
do
they
ever
transfer
any
negroes
in
little
rock
to
a
white
school
or
whites
to
a
negro
school
by
reason
of
moving
a
residence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
permit
it
to
be
typewritten
instead
or
printed,
could
you
and
would
you
accelerate
your
petition
for
certiorari?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler
as
you
were
relating
the
reasons
why
the
school
board
continued
this
for
two-and-a-half
years,
the
question
crossed
my
mind,
suppose
every
other
school
district
in
the
south
would
do
the
same
thing
and
say
we
will
carry
on
segregation
for
a
number
of
years
until
the
law
is
clarified,
how
would
it
ever
be
clarified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
recollection
is
that
in
one
of
those
opinions,
either
the
brown
or
the
alan
case
we
did
say
that
mere
public
opposition
to
the
policy
and
to
the
program
would
not
be
a
cause
either
for
denying
integration
or
for
extending
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
butler
i
think
there
is
no
member
of
this
court
who
fails
to
recognize
the
very
great
problem
which
your
school
board
has,
but
can
we
defer
a
program
of
this
kind
merely
because
there
are
those
elements
in
the
community
that
will
commit
violence
to
prevent
it
from
going
into
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
you're
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
that
the
state
law
that
concerns
you
or
is
it
the
threat
and
violence
that
concerns
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
as
long
as
the
state
laws
conflict
with
the
federal
laws
you
would
think
that
there
should
not
be
any
integration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
time
would
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
isn't
the
question
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
in
the
same
area,
but
it's
a
no
sense
controlling
in
this
case
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
assignment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
pupil
assignment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
is
not
up.
that's
the
call
for
luncheon,
but
so
if
you
have
more
to
say
you
may
take
it
up
after
lunch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
rebuttal,
your
rebuttal
time
of
the
solicitor
general,
do
you,
you
must
make
your
entire
argument
in
response
to
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
this
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
so
you
may
proceed
after
lunch,
if
you
so
advise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
really
aren't
--
aren't
the
rights
of
all
the
negro
children
of
little
rock
wrapped
up
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
mean
wrapped
up
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
principle
that
we
are
litigating
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
your
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
never
tried
--
i
never
tried
to
resolve
any
legal
problem
with
this
kind
as
governor
of
my
state.
i
thought
that
was
a
matter
for
the
courts
and
i
abided
by
the
decision
of
the
courts
whether
they
were
the
courts
of
my
state
or
in
--
in
their
proper
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
have
never
heard
such
an
argument
made
in
the
court
of
justice
before
and
i've
tried
many
a
case
over
many
a
years.
i
never
heard
a
lawyer
say,
that
the
statement
of
the
governor
as
to
--
to
what
was
legal
or
illegal
should
control
the
action
of
any
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
a
short
answer
to
that
is
if
they
want
to
believe
it,
they'll
believe
it
no
matter
who
says
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
have
no
doubt
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
rebuttal
mr.
marshall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
yes.
go
right
ahead.
take
your
time.
you
have
ample
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall,
do
you
have
anything
to
say
in
response
to
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
we
all
--
we
all
came
together
on
rather
short
notice
and
i
know
the
court
would
have
me
thanked
both
mr.
marshall
and
mr.
butler
for
your
able
and
helpful
arguments
made
on
such
short
notice.
mr.
solicitor
general
the
court
is
indeed
indebted
to
you
for
your
cooperative
and
--
and
able
argument
in
this
case.
now,
gentlemen
we're
going
to
take
a
recess
for
--
until
4:30
in
this
matter
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
in
conference
has
determined
upon
the
following
order.
having
considered
the
oral
arguments,
the
court
is
in
agreement
with
the
view
expressed
by
counsel
for
the
respected
parties
and
by
the
solicitor

that
petitioner's
present
application
respecting
the

of
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
of
june
21,
1958
necessarily
involves
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
courts
of
appeals
decision
reversing
the
order
of
judge
lemley.
the
court
is
advised
that
the

the

and

of

is

duly
filed
in

for
the
foregoing
schedule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
copies
--
copies
of
the
order
will
be
available
at
the
clerk's
office
in
a
few
moments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
has
now
reconvened
in
special
term
to
consider
an
application
by
the
petitioners
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
case
of
william
cooper
et
al.,
versus
john
aaron
et
al.,
number
one
miscellaneous
and
a
motion
for
vacation
of
a
stay
of
execution
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
eighth
circuit
in
that
case.
the
petition
was
filed
on
september
8,
1958
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
the
court
of
august
28,
1958.
the
briefs
of
petitioners
and
respondents
were
timely
filed
on
september
9th
and
10th
respectively.
in
addition
five
motions
have
been
received
for
leave
to
file
briefs
as
amicus
curiae.
three
of
these
were
addressed
to
the
proceeding
instituted
by
the
respondents
here
for
the
vacation
of
the
order
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
staying
the
issuance
of
its
mandate,
and
for
a
stay
of
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
arkansas
of
june
21,
1958
in
aaron
et
al.,
versus
cooper
et
al.
two
are
addressed
to
the
instant
proceeding.
treating
them
all
as
addressed
to
the
interest
--
the
instant
proceeding,
all
motions
for
leave
to
file
amicus
curiae
briefs
and
to
intervene
and
argue
are
denied.
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
is
granted
and
we
will
now
proceed
to
the
argument
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
order
of
augment
will
be
first
the
petitioners,
second
the
respondents,
then
the
solicitor
general
and
thereafter
either
of
the
parties
in
rebuttal
of
the
solicitor
general,
the
petitioners
to
speak
last.
counsel
may
wish
to
obtain
the
admission
of
associates
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
if
this
is
desired
the
court
will
entertain
such
motions
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
wish
him
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
now
mr.
butler?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
he
maybe
so
admitted
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
such
service
he
maybe
to
you.
we
will
now
proceed
with
the
argument
of
the
case
mr.
butler.
and
may
i
say
before
we
start
that
the
court
appreciates
the
cooperation
that
we've
had
from
counsel
on
both
sides
of
the
case
in
facilitating
the
hearing
for
us
today.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
doesn't
this
argument
that
you're
making
now,
more
or
less
assume
that
this
is
a
personal
issue
between
the
school
board
and
these
school
children
who
seek
admission
whereas
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
real
issue
before
this
court
is
not
just
whether
the
school
board
is
frustrating
the
rights
of
these
children,
but
whether
the
acts
of
any
agency
of
the
state
of
arkansas
are
preventing
them
from
exercising
their
constitutional
rights
and
whether
it's
a
school
broad
or
whether
it's
a
governor,
whether
it's
a
legislature,
whether
it's
the
militia,
whatever
agency
of
the
state
government,
if
it
did
frustrate
the
rights
of
these
children
is
a
violation
the
constitution,
isn't
that
the
issue
that
we
have
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
conceding
absolute
good
faith
to
the
board,
is
this
court
not
concerned
with
whether
the
state
action
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
whether
that
action
emanated
from
the
school
board
or
from
other
authority,
has
frustrated
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
children
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
butler
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
just
sticking
to
your
own
particular
case,
is
it
your
position
that
if
this
court
recognizes
that
the
school
board
has
acted
faithfully
in
this
manner
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
relieve
the
distress
of
these
children
if
other
state
action
has
deprived
them
of
their
constitutional
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
take
your
own
time,
do
it
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
it's
just
watchful
waiting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
assume
the
court
--
assume
your
school
board
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
and
a
half
felt
that
the
climate
of
opinion
was
the
same
then
as
it
is
now,
what
would
it
be
prepared
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know,
but
if
we
may
have
a
hypothetical
case,
you
put
some
to
us
and
you
present
this
two-and-a-half
year
extension
to
us
without
any
representation
on
the
part
of
the
board
as
to
what
it
proposes
to
do
in
the
meantime.
now
let
us
assume
the
end
of
the
two
years
and
a
half,
if
you
prevail,
that
the
climate
of
opinion
is
as
it
is
now,
would
you
be
in
asking
for
another
two
years
and
a
half
or
would
you
have
a
program
to
bring
about
desegregation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
granted
that
is
true,
and
the
legislature
in
the
meantime
passes
other
laws
to
frustrate
the
rights
of
these
individuals,
would
you
want
to
wait
for
that
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
be
determined
by
the
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
going
to
say
mr.
butler
to
put
this
thing
in
the,
in
perspective,
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
state
of
arkansas
passed
a
constitutional
amendment
in
defiance
of
the
particular
decision
that
that
this
court
granted,
brown
versus
board
of
education
and
that
it
dedicated
the
state
to
opposition
by
every
available
method
the
“unconstitutional
decision
of
brown
versus
board
of
education.”
that's
from
your
constitution
now,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
as
i
understood
your
brief
here
it
commands
the
general
assembly
to
oppose
by
every
constitutional
method
the
“unconstitutional
decision
of
brown
versus
board
of
education”
that's
in
your
constitution,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler
before
you
get
to
another
point
there,
did
i
understand
you
are
correctly
to
say
a
few
moments
ago
that
the
majority
of
the
people
of
little
rock
were
opposed
to
segregation
of
the
races
in
the
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
well
i
just
wanted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
butler
i
think
you
--
we
still
misunderstand
each
other.
my
question
to
you
was
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
a
few
moments
ago
that
a
majority
of
the
people
of
little
rock
are
opposed
to
segregation
of
the
races
in
the
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
you
that,
you
said
yes
that's
correct
but
i
wanted
to
be
sure
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
i
think
your
self
segregation
opposed
to
segregation
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
integration
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
wanted
you
to
tell
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
wanted
to
clear
it
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
perfectly
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
negro
children
are
there
in
little
rock?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
do
you
say
this
only
affects
less
than
1%
of
the
pupils
of
that
district?
aren't
the
rights
of
all
the
children
in
that
district
involved
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
we
stopped
that
program
we
are
denying
this
same
right
to
approximately
40%
of
the
children
of
your
community.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
this
decision,
the
brown
decision
was
in
1954,
this
is
1958,
two
years
and
a
half
will
bring
it
up
almost
to
1961.
now,
if
all
those
children
are
denied
the
right
to
go
to
the
elementary
schools
aren't
they
being
denied
permanently
and
finally
of
a
right
to
get
equal
protection
under
the
laws
during
their
primary
grade
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
by
that
you
don't
accept
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
as
to
whether
it's
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
call
it
intangible
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
somebody
was
to
deprive
you
of
life,
liberty
or
property
would
that
be
an
intangible
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
you
being
questioned
when
you
say
that
the
denial
of
these
rights
to
40%
of
the
children
of
your
community
is
in
the
public
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler
in
the
hearing
before
judge
lemley
did
the
school
board
or
anyone
else
introduce
any
evidence
to
show
that
there
were
any
forces
at
work
or
any
processes
in
motion
to
relieve
your
community
of
this
feeling
and
action
that
is
prompting
your
board
to
take
its
present
position
contrary
to
what
it
took
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wasn't
that
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
butler
do
you
then
believe
that
if
this
court
should
in
deciding
this
case
clarify
the
things
that
you
think
are
now
obscure
in
the
minds
of
the
involved
people
in
arkansas;
that,
that
will
take
the
place
of
the
delay
or
do
you
seek
delay
in
preference
to
clarification?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
gets
a
little
involved
for
me,
but
may
i
put
it
this
way?
would
you
say
that
no
matter
how
clearly
this
court
might
resolve
the
issues
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
you
still
insist
upon
your
delay
of
two-and-a-half
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
still
insist
upon
delay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
take
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
before
us,
mr.
butler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
i
wish
you
wouldn't
go
into
the
briefs.
if
you
filed
amicus
curiae,
you
can
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pick
any
argument
that
you
want
but
the
briefs
are
not
before
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
say
anything
you
want,
but
it
isn't
a
part
of
this
record
when
you
referred
to
it
as
a
brief
in
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
make
any
arguments
you
wish,
but
not
--
not
as
coming
from
the
brief
in
--
on
filing
in
this
court
because
it
isn't
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
do
you
have
anything
in
rebuttal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
last
time
to
say
that
was
the
intention
of
the
board
not
to
make
such
transfers,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marshall,
do
you
have
any
response
to
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
though
that
is
not
the
position
of
your
board.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
are
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
butler,
i
would
again
thank
you
and
your
school
board
and
mr.
marshall
for
facilitating
this
argument
and
you,
mr.
solicitor
general
and
all
of
you
for
the
frank
and
thorough
manner
in
which
you
have
discussed
the
issues.
the
court
will
now
stand
in

in

until
the
