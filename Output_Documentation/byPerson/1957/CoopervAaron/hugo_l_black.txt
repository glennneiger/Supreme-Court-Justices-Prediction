justice
hugo

the
court
of
appeals
record
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
printed
or
merely
typewritten?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
copies
were
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
in
addition
to
that
transcript
(inaudible)
to
have
entire
record
capable
of
being
used
on
a
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
pupil
assignment
law
contains
one
position
that
pupils
can
be
assigned
and
must
be
assigned
on
account
of
their
race
or
color?
would
you
say
that
has
been
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
your
argument
based
on
the
premise
of
the
senate's
in
your
opposition
that
the
reasonable
provides
that
the
end
of
the
(inaudible)
the
national
policy
that
has
been
established.
by
then,
state
law
supporting
to
override
the
brown
case
that
had
been
tested
in
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
premise
of
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
--
may
i
--
do
you
think
--
you
conceive
of
that
as
being
a
charge
merely
that
the
school
board
of
arkansas
has
denied
an
equal
protection
or
a
charge
in
the
state
of
the
arkansas
has
denied
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
sovereignty
law
and
it's
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
law
setup
a
plan
to
abide
by
the
--
this
court's
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
have
that
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
setup
a
plan
at
all
at
any
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
this
court's
decree.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
any
one
of
them
provide
for
obedience
to
the
court's
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
provide
it
in
substance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
judge
lemley
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
it
could
be
anticipated
two-and-a-half
years
of
the
sentiments
which
you
say
is
an
action
of
the
public
petition,
which
you
say
frustrated
the
board,
would
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
from
your
brief
and
argument,
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
right
or
not,
and
it
goes
something
like
this,
there
is
that
you
call
it
in
your
brief,
a
massive
resistance
to
the
constitutional
principle
that
this
court
announced,
state
of
arkansas,
has
been
led
by
your
governor
and
other
high
public
officials,
that
the
board
is
helpless
to
do
anything,
because
of
state
opposition,
and
meaning
by
state
opposition
those
who
are
charged
with
(inaudible),
you're
asking
for
time
on
account
of
that
massive
resistance
and
hostility
to
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
butler,
you
said
you
to
refer
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
continue
to
refer
to
delays
and
i'm
wondering
if
your
position
(inaudible)
i
have.
as
i
understand
your
basic
premise
is
that
in
a
state
where
the
government
--
all
that
--
with
great
majority
of
public
officials
charged
with
enforcement
of
law,
creating
and
most
of
the
people
are
told
in
carrying
out
the
court's
decree,
the
matter
should
be
delayed
in
their
state,
that
it
comes
down
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
what
the
constitution
says
about
that,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
it
be
--
you
would
(inaudible)
stating
whether
or
not
you
believe,
but
you're
not,
of
the
situation
in
the
senate,
at
least
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
that
you
could
predict
that
with
any
time
in
the
foreseeable
future,
this
conflict
on
this
issue
would
be
resolved
unless
a
court
order
was
put
in
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
they
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
of
the
opinion,
would
not
continue
to
be
a
majority
of
the
people,
majority
of
the
officials
who
opposed
hearing
out
the
court's
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
argument
before
as
i
recall
it,
you
stated
that
one
of
the
forceful
arguments
that
was
made
before
us,
that
there
were
statute
passed
by
various
states
that
were
intended
to
nullify,
you
may
not
of
used
the
word
nullify,
to
nullify
this
court's
order
and
people
were
not
sure
it
would
remain
the
law.
as
i
understood
it
you
urge
that
the
court's
opinion
be
made
clear
now
for
its
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
law
that
was
read
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
state
law
that
was
read
to
us
you
have
commented
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
the
naacp,
the
law
that
mr.
marshall
read
to
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
because
it
would
--
would
it
forbid
them
during
what
you
say
is
needed
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
naacp
should
file
a
proceeding
down
in
arkansas.
now,
i
understood
the
statute
to
which
mr.
marshall
referred
that
considerable
obstacles
have
been
thrown
in
the
way
of
naacp
was
referenced
to
litigation,
is
that
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
is
your
argument
then
a
proper
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
make
it
if
you
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what's
the
object
of
this
law?
i
--i
gathered
from
him.
i
haven't
seen
it,
but
i
gathered
from
him,
it
was
to
make
it
impossible
for
lawyers
to
do
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
representing
the
association?
