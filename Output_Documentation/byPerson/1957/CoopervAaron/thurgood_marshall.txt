mr.
thurgood
marshall
may
it
please
the
court.
this
afternoon's
extraordinary
session
was
necessitated
because
of
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioners
here,
the
negro
plaintiffs
in
the
cases
below,
their
right
to
remain
attendance
at
a
desegregated
school
in
central
high
school
in
little
rock
and
this
was
pursuant
to
court
order.
i
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
the
rights
we
are
seeking
protection
for
are
not
rights
that
are
in
the
abstract,
but
rights
that
have
been
determined
not
necessarily
by
the
brown
decision,
but
you
--
the
court
will
remember
that
in
this
case
the
district
court
approved
the
plan
of
desegregation.
the
plaintiffs
below
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eighth
circuit.
it
was
affirmed,
and
court
record
also
shows
that
in
september
of
last
year
there
were
two
applications
for
stay
to
judge
davies
sitting
especially
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
arkansas
and
they
were
both
denied.
so
the
rights
we
seek
are
rights
that
have
been
recognized
by
the
federal
courts
and
as
such
we
believe
that
they
are
in
a
different
category
from
a
normal
litigant
in
an
injunction
proceeding
prior
to
judgment.
but
however
the
normal
procedure
in
this
case
would
have
meant
that
the
stay
of
judge
lemley's
order
would
have
been
issued
by
judge
lemley,
but
he
did
not.
he
refused
and
declined
to
stay
the
judgment.
the
court
will
remember
that
at
the
end
of
this
past
session
of
this
court,
we
filed
a
petitioner
for
certiorari,
seeking
to
have
this
court
review
judge
lemley's
decision
without
first
going
through
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
special
section
that
provides
that
that
shall
happen,
if
there
is
some
extraordinary
situation
which
we
thought
existed.
and
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
the
case
went
back,
rather
we
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
sat
in
extraordinary
session
and
sat
en
banc,
the
entire
court,
and
in
short
time
decided
the
case,
in
unequivocal
language
that
judge
lemley's
order
was
wrong.
i
emphasize
the
language
because
i
will
need
that
in
my
argument
later.
however,
two
days
thereafter
we
having
filed
a
motion
for
the
mandate
to
issue
forthwith,
the
respondent
school
board
having
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
mandate,
we
arrived
in
this
very
extraordinary
situation,
i
would
like
to
call
it
anomaly
in
the
law,
of
an
order
appealed
from,
reversed
insofar
as
an
opinion
can
and
i
have
of
course
recognize
it
is
judgments
and
not
opinions
to
reversal
orders,
and
then
to
have
the
stay
issued.
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
these
entire
proceedings,
starting
with
the
filing
of
the
petition
of
the
school
board
way
back
in
february
asking
for
time,
the
whole
purpose
of
these
proceedings
is
to
get
time.
the
objective
of
the
proceedings
is
that
the
little
rock
schools
be
returned
from
desegregated
to
segregated
status
as
of
september
school
term.
the
order
having
been
declared
in
the
opinion
as
being
wrongfully
issued
the
procedural
device
which
is
normal
to
stay
the
mandate
of
a
court
of
appeals
only
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
so
it
can
get
up
here
that's
the
only
purpose
for
it,
but
in
this
case
the
stay
of
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
decided
the
merits
of
the
case
directly
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
case.
the
opinion
said
that
the
school
board
was
not
entitled
to
a
suspension
of
the
integration
plan.
the
stay
of
the
mandate
said
you
don't
have
to
act
on
this
until
after
the
school
term
begins.
at
that
time
the
school
term
was
to
begin
on
september
2nd.
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
that
has
been
postponed
to
september
8th,
but
at
any
rate
the
staying
of
the
mandate
would
effectively
mean
that
if
this
court
would
wait
until
october,
the
school
term
would
be
in
session
and
i
believe
anybody
will
agree
that
it's
not
good
educational
policy
to
transfer
children
in
the
middle
of
a
school
term.
so
we
have
this
strange
situation
in
the
law
of
a
procedural
device
of
staying
a
mandate
actually
ruling
on
the
merits
in
the
case.
that
point
plus
this
additional
point
and
that
is
that
the
court
certainly
can
take
judicial
notice
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
legislature
in
arkansas
today,
it's
quite
obvious
that
anytime
spent
in
delay
in
this
matter
will
bring
about
not
less
litigation
but
more
litigation
and
that
is
why
and
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
it.
we
believe
that
this
court
must
not
only
and
stay,
vacate
the
stay
of
the
eighth
circuit,
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
but
i
think
that
in
the
present
posture
of
this
litigation,
in
the
very
peculiar
status
that
it's
in,
and
the
atmosphere
that
now
exists
in
the
state
of
arkansas
with
the
governor
and
the
legislature
and
everybody
determined
to
set
themselves
up
against
the
whole
united
states,
that
the
only
effective
relief
that
this
court
can
give
that
will
protect
the
rights
of
the
petitioners
here
would
be
to
stay
the
man
--
i
mean
vacate
the
stay
of
issuance
of
the
mandate.
two,
to
stay
judge
lemley's
order,
suspending
the
previous
orders
of
the
district
court,
and
as
was
done
in
the
lucy
case
for
an
entirely
different
reason,
to
order
that
the
existing
orders
of
judge
miller,
who
originally
heard
the
case
and
judge
davies
who
heard
it,
sitting
specially
assigned
last
september,
be
reinstated
and
in
full
force
in
effect.
a
question
immediately
arises
as
to
whether
this
court
has
authority
to
do
it.
well
as
was
pointed
out
in
many
cases,
the
all
writs
statute
for
one
gives
authority
and
indeed
the
procedural
statute
on
the
staying
of
the
mandate
gives
credence
to
our
position,
and
if
there
is
any
exact
authority
that's
needed,
we
take
the
flat
position
that
the
lucy
case
says
specifically
that
this
court
has
that
authority
and
needs
go
no
further.
i
don't
believe
as
might
be
argued
that
this
court
cannot
and
should
not
go
into
the
merits
of
this.
it
tends
to
raise
the
question
in
my
mind
what
do
we
mean
by
the
merits.
the
merits
in
this
case
have
already
been
decided
by
the
stay
and
the
stay
is
now
being
reviewed
by
this
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
september
8th
is
the
date
fixed
by
the
superintendent
of
schools.
there
is
a
bill
pending
in
the
legislature
postponing
it
until
september
15,
for
the
express
reason
as
seeing
what
happens
in
virginia,
so
they
will
know
what
to
do
in
arkansas,
it
has
no
relation
to
this
case
at
all,
but
the
september
8th
date
was
done
by
the
school
board,
a
day
or
so
ago.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
that
under
the
normal
state
procedure,
the
legislature
could
supercede
the
school
board,
and
indeed
the
difficulty
out
there
is
that
it's
all
going
along
much
in
the
--
i
mean
both
are
working
the
same
way
it
seems
to
me
insofar
as
the
stay
is
concerned.
the
merits
of
this
case,
the
one
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
or
not
this
order
or
these
orders
or
the
district
court
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
suspended
for
a
time.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
the
first
plan,
no
sir
the
original
plan,
the
original
that
was
approved
by
the
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
by
judge
miller.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
happened
was
as
soon
as
the
governor
threatened
to
bring
out
the
troops,
the
school
board
went
to
judge
davies
and
asked
for
instructions
and
he
told
them
move
ahead
with
the
plan.
subsequent
to
that
time,
a
day
or
so
later,
i
don't
remember
the
exact
date,
i
can
get
it
for
you
though
sir,
they
formally
appeared
before
judge
davies
and
asked
for
the
right
to
postpone
operation
of
the
plan
and
judge
davies
ordered
them
“to
proceed
forthwith
with
the
plan.”
and
the
petition
filed
by
the
respondents
here
requested
the
court
to
stay
the
whole
business
saying
that
they
considered
the
first
order
of
judge
miller
to
be
in
affect
an
injunction
and
if
not,
then
the
orders
of
judge
davies,
but
it
was
aimed
at
all
three,
the
petition
as
set
forth.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
is
in
the
full
record
sir.
what
actually
happened
was
that
the
original
was
--
as
i
understand
it
rather
informal
request
of
judge
davies,
the
second
was
a
formal
one,
here
in
(inaudible)
prompt
ruling
then
and
there.
so
that
they
were
under
orders
to
use
the
word
of
the
district
court
to
proceed
with
the
plan
and
they
sought
relief
from
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
and
then
a
petition
asking
a
postponement
of
relief,
and
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
no
sir,
to
keep
them
from
carrying
the
plan
out.
it
had
nothing
--
it
adjust
--
that
they
didn't
--
because
of
this
atmosphere
situation,
they
wanted
to
be
relieved
from
putting
the
children
in
school
as
of
that
september.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
as
i
understand
it,
as
i
read
it
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
will
--
since
with
permission
of
the
court
we
can
get
those
from
the
record,
we
don't
have
it
with
us
though.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
i
think
that
along
that
line
mr.
judge
finley
should
also
point
out
that
while
judge
miller's
opinion
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it,
that
we
took
the
position
that
we
would
carry
it
no
further
and
we
went
back
to
work
along
with
whatever
could
be
done,
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
we
let
it
stay
right
there
and
let
it
go
back
as
such
and
considered
ourselves
bound
by
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
no
sir,
no
i
mean
the
--
no
we
lost.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
miller's
opinion
approving
this
plan,
we
opposed
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
we
urged
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
it,
because
it
required
too
much
time.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir
with
the
theory
that
would
see
it
worked
out.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
just
in
a
measure,
to
go
into
some
of
the
background
of
this
case,
because
as
we
see
it
the
factual
--
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
clearly
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
in
our
brief
and
now
we
don't
think
its
necessary
to
go
into
too
great
detail,
but
there
are
one
or
two
points
that
i
think
need
emphasizing
and
that
is
that
the
record
will
show
that
with
the
exception
of
the
one
time
that
the
school
board
asked
for
affirmative
relief
when
a
white
parent
obtain
judgment
in
a
chancery
court
to
which
governor
faubus
and
other
people
had
testified
and
the
chancery
judge
ruled
that
the
school
board
should
be
enjoined
from
carrying
out
the
plan
which
the
district
court
had
approved.
the
school
board
did
on
that
occasion
go
into
judge
davies
and
properly
judge
davies
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
that
state
judgment,
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
well
with
the
exception
of
that,
the
only
relief
that
the
school
board
has
asked
from
the
district
court
is
postponement.
they
have
asked
for
no
relief
in
affirmative
relief
to
help
this
thing
along.
that
goes
back
from
the
two
requests
in
september
of
last
year
and
bear
in
mind
that
the
petition
in
this
case
which
is
before
you
today,
was
asked
for
way
back
in
february,
it
was
around
february
that
they
gave
up.
that
was
when
they
asked
for
this
relief
and
it
sat
there
for
a
while
until
chief
judge
gardner
assigned
judge
lemley
to
hear
it
and
the
hearing
took
place
in
the
early
part
of
june.
so,
on
that
basis
it
seems
to
us
that
as
the
government
points
out
in
its
brief
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
there
was
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
school
board
to
get
help
in
this
situation,
and
the
only
objection
at
all
was
that
the
community
was
opposed
to
it.
and
the
other
point
that
they
rely
on
in
their
memorandum
and
in
their
brief,
is
that
a
stay
of
this
will
help
and
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
response
that
they
filed
to
our
petition,
and
up
to
the
present
day,
with
the
exception
of
two
points,
one
that
governor
faubus
might
not
be
in
office
two-and-a-half
years
from
now
and
that
certain
statutes
of
arkansas
now
being
litigated
might
be
decided
within
two-and-a-half
years,
with
the
exception
of
those
points
as
of
this
minute,
the
school
board
has
not
given
anybody
any
information
of
what
they
propose
to
do
in
the
two-and-a-half
years
while
these
rights
are
being
suspended.
and
in
the
question
of
a
stay
or
the
vacation
of
a
stay
and
in
cases
cited
in
our
brief
we
point
out
that
the
law
is
quite
similar
between
the
two,
especially
the
virginia
case
and
the
breswick
case
and
a
few
others
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
there's
got
to
be
a
showing
of
one
the
irreparable
harm
on
one
side
as
against
that
on
the
other
side.
the
record
shows
that
these
children
will
graduate.
so
far
as
matters
now
stand,
if
they
are
in
segregated
schools
next
year
their
rights
are
just
gone,
i
mean
that's
the
end
of
that.
on
the
other
hand,
the
statute
which
affirmatively
gives
the
right
of
the
court,
2101
(f),
of
any
court
to
stay
issuance
of
mandates,
provides
that
the
court
may
if
necessary
require
supersedes
of
some
form.
and
again
this
case
solely,
because
of
the
peculiar
situation,
the
states
is
never
required
to
give
bond
and
so
they're
not
even
required
to
give
and
we
have
a
complete
change
of
status.
when
this
case
was
heard,
those
children
in
the
central
high
school
now
seven,
there
were
nine,
one
graduated,
ernest
green
graduated,
one
minnijean
brown
was
expelled,
leaving
seven,
those
seven
were
in
an
integrated
school
system.
they
had
been
there
for
a
year.
under
judge
lemley's
order,
they
are
taken
out,
and
that's
going
to
change
the
status,
there
is
a
physical
change
of
status.
and
they
are
taken
out
as
of
--
it
would
only
be
effective
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
from
the
opening
of
the
school,
because
school
had
been
in
recess,
but
that
complete
change
of
status
must
have
some
extraordinary
reason
to
be
sustained.
the
normal
procedure
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
and
i
submit
that
judge
lemley
was
the
one
that
should
have
stayed
an
order,
not
the
court
of
appeals
to
stay
its
order
reversing
it.
and
we
finally,
we
take
the
flat
decision
that
on
the
merits
of
this
case
we
are
entitled
to
relief,
not
that
we
need
to
establish
that
point
in
order
to
get
relief,
but
we
take
the
position
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
so
clear,
that
the
respondents
here
had
nothing
that
they
could
successfully
bring
to
this
court,
and
in
many
of
the
rulings
of
this
court,
in
chambers,
that
if
taken
into
consideration,
the
possibility
of
whether
or
not
you
actually
have
a
justiciable
issue
recognizable
by
this
court.
and
the
petitioners
had
no
such
case,
and
yet
they
can
toy
around
with
the
situation,
and
effectively
deny
these
rights
by
using
procedural
devices
such
a
motion
to
stay.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
this
court
you
need
more
than
a
justiciable
issue.
you
need
an
issue
that
one,
is
cognizable
by
this
court,
and
is
sufficient
to
get
a
sufficient
number
of
justices
to
agree
with
it,
i
mean
it's
more
than
just
a
justiciable
issue.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
yes,
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
we
take
the
position
that
under
the
lucy
case
it
has
no
weight
at
this
time
before
this
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
mr.
justice
clark
that
there
is
considerable
authority
among
educators
that
it's
not
well
--
it's
not
good
educational
practice
to
transfer
students
in
the
middle
of
the
year.
as
to
one
or
two
days
i
imagine
that
would
be
all
right,
but
in
the
mid
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
not
at
all.
well
i
was
basing
that
solely
on
good
educational
practices.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
am
urging
them
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
conjunctively
and
mr.
justice
i
would
also
say
that
because
of
the
developments
now
going
on
in
arkansas,
that
this
case
should
be
decided
on
its
merits
and
it
could
be
done,
there
are
precedents
in
this
court
where
it
has
been
done.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
i
also
--
that's
true
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
also
(inaudible)
to
be
perfectly
frank,
i'm
thinking
about
the
lustig
case,
where
as
i
remember
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
during
argument
and
in
this
case
i
think
that
as
we
said
in
our
original
petition
for
certiorari,
which
this
court
can
reconsider
on
its
own
motion.
our
original
petition
for
certiorari,
when
that
was
filed
this
court
said,
you
will
remember
that
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
court
of
appeals
will
recognize
the
vital
importance
of
the
time
element
in
this
litigation,
and
that
it
will
act
upon
the
application
for
a
stay
or
the
appeal
in
ample
time
to
permit
arrangements
to
be
made
for
the
next
school
year.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
language,
which
was
a
basis
for
denying
our
petition
for
certiorari,
i
think
present
developments
in
the
eight
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
conditions
as
they
exist
in
arkansas
would
at
least
impel
this
court
to
order
that
it
be
heard
on
its
merits.
now
we
have
no
authority
as
such.
we
could
file
a
petition
for
certiorari,
but
we
considered
it,
and
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
the
court,
we
took
the
position
that
it
had
been
done
before,
and
that
this
court
could
reconsider
our
petition
filed
in
june,
and
order
argument
on
it
or
could
consider
it
right
here
and
now.
and
i
--
the
only
thing
--
i
believe
that
the
way
this
case
stands,
there
must
be
a
definitive
decision,
and
i
use
the
two
together,
i
mean
it's
bad
english,
but
it's
the
best
way
i
can
do
it,
that
there
be
no
doubt
in
arkansas
that
the
orders
of
that
district
court
down
there
must
be
respected
and
cannot
be
suspended
and
cannot
be
interfered
with
by
the
legislature
or
anybody
else.
and
less
than
that,
i
don't
think
we'll
give
these
young
children
the
protection
that
they
need
and
they
most
certainly
deserve
and
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
would
say
that
we
requested
it
both
and
not
in
the
alternative.
and
at
this
time
we
respectfully
suggest
that
it
would
be
even
better
for
this
court
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
because
the
stay,
which
is
being
reviewed
decided
it
on
the
merits,
and
so
this
court
in
deciding
the
stay
i
don't
see
much
chance
of
doing
it,
but
i
do
know
that
technically
it
could
be
done
without
hitting
the
merits.
you
consider
the
merits,
but
the
ruling
would
either
be,
the
stay
of
the
mandate
or
--
i
mean
the
stay
of
the
--
the
vacation
of
the
stay
of
the
mandate
or
the
reverse
of
judge
lemley's
order.
but
i
don't
believe
that
would
give
us
what
we
thought
would
be
enough,
and
it's
because
of
the
present
developments
out
there,
and
i
think
this
court
must
consider
the
whole
story.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
sir?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
brief.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
did
not,
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
we
would
be
prepared
to
argue
and
with
permission
to
submit
a
brief
and
we
could
do
a
brief
on
this
case
in
less
than
half
a
day.
we
are
prepared
to
argue
it
now,
with
the
right
to
submit
a
brief
at
a
late
time,
because
judge
mathes'
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
so
clear.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
have
not
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
further
that
if
the
court
did
it
that
way,
it
would
still
be
preserved
in
the
traditional
function
of
the
stay
of
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
pending
petition
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
on
certiorari
yes
sir,
but
i
think
that
as
long
as
this
case
undecided
on
its
merits,
our
plaintiffs,
our
petitioners
in
this
case
will
still
be
under
terrific
pressure
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
it,
which
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
its
denial
of
original
petition
for
cert.
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
it
has
been
done,
i
would
have
hesitated
to
suggest
it,
but
i
think
that
in
several
occasions
this
court
has
ordered
cases
brought
up
the
--
i
mean
for
example
under
some
precedents,
as
i
understand
it,
was
kind
of
late
in
the
morning
when
we
read
them,
but
we
understand
that
this
court
could
order
the
school
board
to
file
its
petition
within
one
or
two
days
and
be
heard
properly
before
school
is
opened
or
you
could
consider
as
i
said
the
petition
that
we
filed.
may
it
please
the
court
on
the
--
finally
i
would
like
to
wind
this
up
because
i
don't
think
that
there's
too
much
law
that
is
necessary
because
it
is
certainly
not
in
conflict,
we
rely
on
the
virginia
case
and
on
down
to
the
present
time.
we
also
have
the
--
some
british
cases
in
there
which
all
are
on
the
same
theory
about
the
power
and
duty
of
the
court
to
stay
or
to
vacate
and
what
can
properly
be
considered
by
the
court.
the
government
in
its
brief
cites
the
same
cases
and
additional
cases
and
so
i
would
say
as
said
back
here
that
when
you
weigh,
and
i
for
one
cannot
hardly
talk
about
weighing
anything
against
constitutional
rights,
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
how
to
do
it,
but
here
we
have
negro
children,
and
the
record
will
show
they
have
done
nothing
bad
except
the
record
will
show
that
one
did,
the
record
will
show,
there's
a
dispute
about
it
but
it
will
show
it
and
she
was
expelled
so
that's
no
problem,
but
that
these
children
must
be
forced
to
surrender
their
constitutional
rights
is
unimportant
in
this
court
today.
the
point
is
set
forth
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
quoting
from
the
strutwear
knitting
case,
the
government's
case
brief
which
was
filed
this
morning
points
out
that
it's
really
a
surrender
to
obstructionist
and
mob
action
and
that
is
much
more
destructive
of
democratic
government
than
it
is
of
some
few
negroes'
rights.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
complaining
about
judge
lemley's
order
being
in
effect.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
which
is
reversed
by
opinion
and
–
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
the
point
i
–
i
think
i
get
it,
i
thought
i
cleared
it
up
with
the
chief
justice's
question
which
is,
as
i
understood
the
question,
my
answer
was
that
if
this
court
stayed
judge
lemley's
order,
there
would
not
be
need
for
touching
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
try
to
make
it
clear
that
what
we
wanted
to
get
the
original
court
orders
in
there.
and
judge
lemley's
order
was
standing
in
the
way
and
certainly
that
would
be
correct.
and
i
mean
i'm
making
this
statement
on
my
feet
but
i
–
we
have
given
it
some
thought
and
the
reason
we
put
both
in
was
because
originally,
you
were
right
sir
it
was
thought
among
lawyers
that
are
working
on
this
that
it
was
an
all
proposition.
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
–
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
would
but
i,
as
i
said,
in
addition
to
that
as
things
now
stand
i
don't
think
either
of
them
will
be
enough.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
absolutely
normal,
but
i
–
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
as
i
understand
it
is
done
every
day
in
day
–
indeed
the
books
so
say.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
our
position
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
normally
that's
what's
done
in
the
state
of
mandate,
but
when
in
effect
the
decision,
the
issue
of
the
case
is
a
stay,
a
suspension,
the
merits
of
the
case
is
a
suspension,
then
when
the
court
of
appeals
decides
that
the
other
side
is
not
entitled
to
a
suspension
in
its
opinion
and
then
suspends
in
its
order
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
it's
an
absolute
anomaly.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
i
understand
you
now
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
–
i
think
the
real
problem
in
this
case
is
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
wants
to
go
into
the
merits,
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
would
make
the
same
argument
and
indeed
in
our
brief
we
said
the
argument
applied
to
both
situations.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
sir,
of
course
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
cannot
getaway
from
the
fact
that
it's
judge
lemley
order
that
does
the
damage.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
circuit.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
have
argued
it.
i
am
prepared
to
argue
it
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
i
did
not
want
to
get
into
the
point
of
upsetting
what
normally
is
procedural
is
--
as
procedural
device
for
appealing
to
this
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
does
have
that
power.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that's
--
i
am
sure
that's
correct
sir,
but
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
still
go
back
to
my
other
question
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
that
whether
you
consider
the
vacation
of
the
stay
of
the
eighth
circuit
or
whether
you
consider
a
stay
of
judge
lemley's
order,
the
merits
are
so
entwined
that
this
is
one
of
the
type
of
cases
where
it
--
it
points
to
the
need
for
it.
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
take
that
position
and
we've
tried
to
develop
it.
it's
just
without
merit,
but
in
the
posture
of
this
case
it
seems
to
me
the
easiest
way
would
be
to
doing
both.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
application
for
stay
and
the
ruling
on
the
application
were
both
the
same
day
and
we
got
our
copies
the
next
day.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
just,
they
just
filed
a
motion
of
stay
and
when
it
was
received
it
was
granted
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir
we
filed
a
motion
that
it
be
issued
forthwith.
we
filed
that
ahead
of
it,
we
filed
it
the
very
next
day
after
the
opinion
came
down.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
they
filed
their
motion
to
stay
and
on
the
day
it
arrived
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
decided
and
it
is
also
along
that
line
which
was
pointed
out
in
the
virginian
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
where
the
court
took
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
stay
was
given
without
reasons.
the
stay
in
this
case
was
really
given
on
to
the
procedural
statute
which
says
that
a
stay
can
be
granted
for
the
purpose
of
petition
in
the
supreme
court,
but
nothing
at
all
on
the
merits
and
i
presume
the
merits
weren't
considered.
and
so
that
at
this
--
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation
is
the
first
time
that
the
merits,
and
i
use
merits
merely
as
to
the
merits
as
to
whether
or
not
an
order
is
entitled
to
be
stayed,
that
for
the
first
time
the
merits
of
that
are
being
considered
for
the
first
time.
and
we
take
the
position
that
when
you
balance
these
rights
of
these
kids
involved
plus
what
this,
this
court
said
in
the
brown
case,
the
public
interest,
meaning
the
public
interest
of
the
united
states
over
against
a
school
board's
position
that
there
are
some
people
that
don't
want
to
let
this
thing
go
through
then
certainly
the
equities
involved
lean
toward
the
protection
of
those
constitutional
rights
rather
than
the
postponement
of
them.
and
i
believe
that
i
have
to
recognize
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case
and
is
expressed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
there
is
no
problem
about
it.
they
just
cannot
be
surrender
--
and
they
mentioned
the
case
that
i
said
before
the
strutwear
knit
case
which
is
famous
for
the
expression
about
handling
bank
robbers
you,
you
don't
close
the
banks
you
put
the
bank
robbers
in
jail.
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
and
i
don't
want
to
prolong
the
argument
that
we
are
entitled
to
both,
at
the
same
time
it
seems
to
me
that
the
real
justice
of
the
case
would
not
be
required
by
going
into
either,
but
that
either
on
our
petition
for
cert
originally
filed
or
by
some
other
procedural
device
that
this
court
be
given
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
merits.
as
i
said
before
petitioners
are
perfectly
willing
to
argue
the
case
on
the
merits
even
though
we
were
successful
insofar
as
opinion
of
the
lower
court
was
concerned.
the
law
i
think
of
reading
of
the
three
briefs,
our
brief,
the
school
board's
brief
and
the
government's
brief,
demonstrates
that
there
is
really
no
serious
conflict
of
the
law
as
to
the
authority
of
this
court
to
act.
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
school
board
as
to
whether
this
court
should
act,
and
on
that
we
think
that
the
equities
on
the
side
of
school
children
are
such
that
the
only
relief
that
can
be
granted
that
will
be
effective
will
be
for
the
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
in
the
state
legislature
or
arkansas,
i
don't
know
whether
it
passed
or
not
but
it's
there
pending
i
understand.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
september
8th.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
september
8th
is
the
deadline
and
i
think
if
i
can
think
ahead
about
when
the
20
days
for
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
would
be
up
on
the
7th,
but
the
stay
gave
them
30
days
from
the
date
of
judgment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
at
least
i
haven't
received
a
copy
of
it.
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
ten
day
i
think
it
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
on
the
19th,
was
it,
18th,
no
sir,
no
sir
it
was
18th
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
if
your
honor
please
we
will
reserve
the
time
for
not
necessarily
that
we
will
use
it,
but
if
we
may
reserve
it
in
case
if
we
need.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
copy
of
the
record,
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
i
can
do
this
mr.
justice
black.
we
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript
of
testimony
and
the
pleading
files,
we
don't
have
that
with
us
but
we
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
no
affidavits
it
was
all
testimony
and
exhibits,
a
whole
basket
full
of
newspapers.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
three,
practically
three
days,
not
five
and
the
testimony
was
mostly
from
the
school
board
people
showing
what
a
difficult
problem
they
had
from
the
chief
of
police,
the
chairman
of
the
school
board
and
the
only
testimony
produced
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
petitioners
here
with
two
expert
witnesses
as
to
how
to
run
a
–
how
a
school
system
could
be
run.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
of
the
transcript.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
each
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript
and
i
would
be
very
glad
to
deposit
the
transcript
copy
with
the
clerk.
i
would
be
very
happy
to
do
and
will
so
do.
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
typewritten.
we
were
permitted
to
go
up
on
the
original
record
from
the
court
of
appeals,
including
the
type
transcript
and
the
argument
was
based
on
the
typed
transcript
or
the
testimony.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
they
were
holding
a
special
term
and
they
gave
us
that
permission.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
how
many
copies
do
we
have?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
two
so
far
as
i
--
two
so
far
as
i
know.
i
think
that's
correct
isn't
it,
that's
all
that
i
know
of
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
black
i
don't
think
the
pleadings
would
be
necessary.
they
are
very
brief
and
you
would
no
trouble,
they
could
be
run
off.
the
exhibits
consisted
of
a
large
batch
of
newspapers
which
could
--
instead
of
being
printed
could
be
deposited
with
the
court,
and
so
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
put
those
in
the
record,
and
you
wouldn't
need
--
so
far
as
i
can
concede,
you
wouldn't
need
anything
but
the
transcript
and
the
pleadings,
both
of
which
we
have
and
we're
going
to
file
the
transcript
and
unless
we
file
the
pleadings
too
at
the
same
time,
copy
of
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
just
one
point,
may
it
please
the
court.
that
i
want
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there
are
two
points.
one
was
this
question
of
this
empty
victory.
we've
had
this
argued
in
this
case
from
beginning
to
end.
and
i
--
i
think
the
court
will
remember
that
the
eminent
attorney,
the
late
john
davis
in
arguing
this
verdict,
the
brown
case
stood
here
and
argued,
the
story
of
the
(inaudible)
the
bone
across
the
bridge
and
looking
in
and
dropping
the
bone.
and
i
submit
that
that
argument
has
been
made
to
this
court,
it's
been
disposed
of
in
the
brown
case.
it
has
no
bearing.
on
the
question
--
mr.
justice
black's
question
about
time
to
resolve
these
laws,
i
hope
the
court
realizes
that
as
the
school
board
is
making
that
argument
that
they
must
have
time
to
get
the
courts
to
pass
on
the
laws
that
were
passed
two
years
ago.
the
legislature
is
now
passing
a
dozen
laws
of
solid
days
and
i
will
assume
that
in
short
time
they'll
be
back
asking
for
time
to
have
those
laws
construed
and
that
would,
it
seems
to
me,
result
in
perpetual
delay
insofar
as
this
is
concern.
the
other
question
that
mr.
butler
couldn't
answer
and
i
can't
answer
but
i
don't
answer
form
newspapers
that
the
three
negro
children
that
did
apply
to
the
white
schools
were
declined
admission,
that
was
in
the
newspapers
by
superintendent
blossom
and
that
he
intended
to
maintain
the
policy
of
segregated
schools
come
opening
of
this
school
term.
i
don't
know
how
that
could
get
into
the
record
it's
--
it's
a
mere
newspaper
statement
but
the
last
thing,
i
like
to
call
the
court's
attention,
as
i
construe
mr.
butler's
argument,
except
for
the
fact
that
he
wants
time
to
prepare
briefs.
he
seems
to
be
in
complete
agreement
that
the
merits
in
this
case
have
to
be
going
into
and
i
wish
to
restate
that
our
opposition
on
that
particular
point.
i
--
the
--
the
balance
into
these
equities,
it's
not
as
easy
as
it's
stated.
i
realize
the
school
board
has
a
difficult
job
but
there's
no
solution
there
--
just
three
things
that
were
mentioned
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
one
was
that
the
(inaudible)
of
--
of
locks
over
the
lockers
and
instead
of
punishing
the
people
that
did
it,
they
replaced
the
locks.
and
i
--
i
hate
to
mention
it
in
the
court
of
law
but
the
record
shows
in
the
court
of
appeals,
opinion
shows
that
the
white
children,
the
20
or
25,
a
very
small
group
start
to
practice
of
urinating
on
the
radiators
and
instead
of
putting
the
children
out,
they
put
the
radiators
out.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
solution
to
this
problem
that
is
recognizes
a
difficult
problem
as
the
only
possible
solution
to
put
the
negro
kids
out
of
school.
i
don't
submit
that
that
is
the
only
solution.
the
record
in
this
case
would
bare
that
out
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
or
not
this
court
goes
into
the
merits
certainly,
these
negro
kids
and
the
others
that
are
involved
in
the
class
action
are
entitled
to
the
most
affirmative
relief
possible
out
of
this
court,
before
school
opens,
even
if
it's
a
consideration
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
one
or
two
preliminary
points
and
then
i
think,
the
argument
for
respondents
can
be
rather
briefed,
because
i
think
the
issues
are
so
clear.
the
first
one
i
--
i
hate
to
start
again
in
answering
an
argument,
but
i
take
the
flat
position
that
this
quote,
“battle
between
the
sovereigns”
was
decided
with
the
constitution
when
it
was
adopted.
that
was
settled
some
years
ago.
that
leads
into
the
second
point
which
is
i
think
it's
one
thing
for
a
law
politician
in
the
state
to
argue
or
a
political
officer
in
a
state
to
argue,
that
the
disagreement
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
or
the
doubt
as
to
the
power
authority
of
the
supreme
court.
that
makes
another
thing
for
a
lawyer
to
stand
in
this
court
and
argue
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
it.
and
i
think
that's
where
we
are
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
reason
to
hold
up
this
for
this
other
lawyers.
mr.
butler
said
he
wasn't
--
he
wasn't
too
sure
what
was
in
it.
well,
here
is
one
batch
of
laws
passed
by
the
legislature
in
arkansas,
the
general
assembly,
giving
the
governor
his
authority
and
here's
what
has
come
about.
since
judge
lemley's
order,
as
a
result
of
judge
lemley's
order,
this
is
the
action
we
can
expect
to
be
amplified
for
two
and
a
half
or
more
years.
this
is
s.b.no.2,
senate
bill
number
2
introduced
by
(inaudible).
it
says,
it
--
it
has
been
found
and
it
is
hereby
declared
by
the
general
assembly
that
a
large
majority
of
the
people
of
this
state
are
opposed
to
the
possible
integration
of,
or
mixing
other
races
in
the
public
schools
of
the
state,
that
practically
all
of
the
people
of
the
state
are
opposed
to
the
use
of
federal
troops
in
aide
of
such
integration.
that
the
people
of
the
state
are
opposed
to
the
use
of
any
federal
power
to
enforce
the
integration
of
the
races
in
the
public
schools,
that
it
has
now
threatened
that
negro
children
will
be
forcibly
enrolled
and
permitted
to
attend
some
of
the
public
schools
of
the
state,
formally
attended
only
by
white
children.
that
the
president
of
united
states
has
indicated
that
federal
troops
maybe
used
to
enforce
the
orders
of
the
district
court
restricting
enrollment
in
attendance
of
negro
pupils
in
schools,
formally
attended
only
by
white
children.
and
that
the
possible
operation
of
a
public
school
in
this
state
attended
by
both
negro
and
white
children
will
inevitably
result
in
violence
in
and
about
the
schools
and
throughout
the
district,
both
endangering
the
safety
of
buildings
and
other
property
wise.
and
that
the
state
or
feeling
of
the
great
majority
of
people
of
the
state
is
such
that
a
forcible
mix
in
the
races
in
public
schools
will
seriously
impair
the
operation
in
suitable
efficient
schools
and
on
and
on.
and
that
exact
same
section
is
quoted
in
everyone
of
this
batch
of
bills
which
gives
to
the
governor
the
right
to
close
the
schools,
take
away
the
money,
use
it
for
private
schools
to
give
the
state
money
to
private
schools,
provided
they
have
operated
on
the
segregated
basis,
and
other
means
of
relief.
the
other
batch
of
bills
are
bills
that
are
aimed
at
and
i
hope
despite
references
have
been
made
to
counsel
on
this
side
and
not
to
mention
who
this
bill
is
directed
to.
this
is
an
act
entitled,
an
act
to
prohibit
the
fomenting
and
education
and
litigation
that
interferes
with
the
orderly
administration
of
public
schools
and
institution
of
higher
learning,
and
to
prohibit
the
solicitation,
receipt
or
donation
of
funds
for
the
purpose
of
filing
of
prosecuting
lawsuits
to
define
maintenance,
divide
a
penalty
and
therefore,
statute
closely
like
the
one
in
virginia,
which
a
three-judge
court
with
an
opinion,
exhausted
opinion
by
judge
soper,
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
in
which
bills
are
now
before
this
court.
if
time
is
given,
it's
obvious
from
this
that
in
two
and
a
half
years,
the
law
will
be
so
crystalized
in
little
rock,
i
mean
in
arkansas
that
there
will
be
no
litigation,
and
they're
protected
by
making
sure
that
there'll
be
no
lawyers
to
litigate.
and
that
is
the
reason
that
the
plea
is
made
for
time,
and
whether
or
not
the
school
board
believes
as
they
do,
time
is
time.
i
don't
believe,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
ever
before
has
an
effort
been
made
to
get
a
watering
down
of
constitutional
rights
without
any
basis
and
although
it
was
brought
out
in
questioning.
as
of
right
now,
these
petitioners
in
this
case
had
given
not
the
slightest
idea
of
doing
anything.
and
that's
what
gets
me
to
the
point
that
they
say
that
we
agree
that
we
should
balance
equities.
i
never
have
agreed,
as
a
lawyer
that
you
can
balance
personal
equities
against
constitutional
rights,
but
even
if
you
go
into
the
so-called,
what
petitioners
call
equities,
with
all
of
the
problems
that
the
children
went
through
in
that
school
and
the
faculties.
democracy
has
stopped.
there's
always
going
to
be
a
measure
of
difficulty
and
problems.
the
school
board
is
so
worried
because
they
get
threat
in
telephone
calls
and
letters.
i
don't
believe
anybody
ever
in
public
office
that
is
worth
assaulted
and
make
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
that
didn't
get
telephone
calls
and
letters.
that's
a
--
that's
a
part
of
service
to
democracy.
i
don't
welcome
it,
but
i
--
i
recognize
it.
but
i
think
we
have
to
think
about
these
children
and
their
parents.
these
negro
children
went
through
this
everyday,
and
their
parents
has
stayed
at
home,
wondering
what
was
happening
to
there
children,
listening
to
the
radio
about
the
bomb
threats
and
all
of
that
business.
i
don't
see
how
anybody
under
the
sun
could
say
that
after
those
children,
those
families
went
through
that
for
a
year
to
tell
them,
“all
you
have
done
is
gone.
you
fought
for
what
you
consider
to
be
democracy
and
you
lost,
and
you
go
back
to
the
segregated
school
from
which
you
came.”
i
just
don't
believe
it
and
i
don't
believe
you
can
balance
those
rights.
so,
don't
question
here
of
the
right
of
one
group
of
children
against
another.
the
other
side
constantly
talks
and
indeed
judge
lemley
taught
about
the
injury
to
education.
it's
according
to
what
type
of
education
we're
talking
about.
in
our
brief,
i
think
it
started
around
page
8.
we
quoted
from
the
decision
in
the
brown
case
and
the
west
virginia
against
barnette
and
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
two
weeks
ago,
as
to
what
education
is.
education
is
not
the
teaching
of
three
hours.
education
is
teaching
of
the
overall
citizenship,
to
learn,
to
leave
together
with
fellow
citizens
and
above
all,
to
learn
to
obey
the
law.
now,
we
talk
about
public
education.
we
think
from
those
three
quotations
there
is
clear.
that's
what
we
mean
and
the
damage
to
the
education
in
arkansas
in
little
rock
and
in
central
high
comes
about
to
the
order
of
judge
lemley,
which
says
that
not
only
the
school
board
and
the
state
came
and
ensured
to
submit
to
more
violence
and
threats
of
more
violence
what
did
federal
judiciary
likewise
should
do
so.
i
don't
know
of
anymore
horrible
destruction
of
principle
of
citizenship
and
to
tell
young
children
that
those
of
you
who
withdrew
rather
than
to
go
to
the
school
with
negroes,
those
of
you
who
are
punished
last
year
the
three
--
the
few
that
the
school
board
did
punish.
come
back,
all
is
forgiven,
you
win.
and
therefore,
i'm
not
worried
about
the
negro
children
at
this
stage.
i
don't
believe
they're
in
this
case
as
such.
i
worry
about
the
white
children
in
little
rock
who
are
told
as
young
people
that
the
way
to
get
your
rights
is
to
violate
the
law
and
defy
the
lawful
authorities.
i'm
worried
about
their
future.
i
don't
worry
about
the
negro
kids'
future.
they've
been
struggling
with
democracy
long
enough.
they
know
about
it.
this
is
actually
laid
there.
the
state
of
arkansas
with
the
governor
holding
these
bills,
refusing
to
sign
them
and
say
publicly
that
he
holds
them
to
see
what
this
court
is
going
to
do.
maybe
it's
happened
before,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
others
as
where
the
governor
of
a
state
has
tried
to
hold
something
over
this
court.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
recognize
that,
not
to
consider
this
case
as
counsel
for
the
school
board
would
say,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
children
in
little
rock
lost
some
education
last
year.
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
in
complete
conflict.
they
say
that
the
--
the
great
feeling
of
having
troops
in
the
school,
for
the
record
shows
that
the
president
is
responsible
for
sending
the
troops
to
little
rock,
but
the
record
shows
and
i
think
it's
page
269,
that
they
were
put
in
the
school
at
the
request
of
superintendent
blossom.
he's
the
one
who
put
them
inside
of
the
school.
the
president
didn't
and
he's
now
complaining
about
it
and
to
show
this
horrible
effect
in
the
record
in
this
case
about
the
effect
of
the
troops
being
in
the
school.
there
is
also
a
witness
who
is
a
band
director
who
has
his
band
class
and
everything
up
on
the
fifth
floor
to
round
things
up
on
top
of
the
(inaudible)
so
the
sound
goes
up
and
disturb
the
--
there
are
no
negroes
in
the
band
class.
there
are
not
even
negroes
on
that
floor
that
he
said
he
couldn't
teach,
because
of
the
effect
of
negroes
being
down
on
the
first
floor
the
fact
that
him
teaching
up
on
the
fifth
floor.
well
that's
stretching
a
little
in
my
imagination.
i
mean,
that's
moving
a
little
too
far,
and
i
think
that
that's
the
type
of
testimony
in
this
record
where
--
where
there's
just
no
basis
for
it
and
i
would
not
urge
this
court
make
this
effort
to
balance
the
harm
--
to
one
of
the
harm
to
the
other.
the
next
point
i
like
to
make
is
that
in
the
deep
south
today,
there
are
three
sets
of
school
boards.
there's
one
set
that
is
working
along
and
working
it
out
either
with
or
without
court
orders
and
working
it
out
on
a
procedural
basis
and
ranging
over
periods
of
years,
varying
with
each
school
district.
in
other
school
boards,
it
says,
“we
just
won't
move
at
all.”
and
there's
a
third
group
that
says,
“the
only
way
to
move
is
over
a
very
gradual
period
of
years,”
and
in
this
case,
we
have
that
--
it's
a
gradual
plan
as
you
can
find.
there
was
no
ultimate
time
limit
on
it.
it
would
just
go
on
and
on,
and
it
was
approved
by
the
district
court,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
brought
to
this
court.
we
went
back
down
to
see
if
it
worked
out.
and
now,
they
say
that
this
--
the
most
gradual
of
gradual
plans
can't
work,
then
that
group
has
joined
the
other
group
which
says,
“it
just
can't
work
anyhow.”
and
so,
the
brown
decision
means
nothing,
except
in
the
areas
where
the
people
voluntarily
accepted
it.
and
in
their
brief,
they
argue
in
--
in
one
particular
place.
it's
on
page
29
of
their
brief.
they
argue
this
after
saying
after
two
and
one
a
half
years.
they
say,
“if
in
the
nature
of
things,
there
will
never
be
any
protection.
operation
should
be
suspended
until
such
time
as
the
people
by
processes
of
time
are
taught
to
respect
court
decisions
and
to
be
\willing
on
patriotic
grounds
to
subdue
the
passions
which
now
control
their
thinking.”
if
constitutional
rights
are
to
wait
for
that
period,
i
submit
you
don't
need
the
constitution
and
you
don't
need
this
court,
if
everybody
was
voluntarily
do
right,
but
it
is
interesting
on
this
time
element.
these
two
and
a
half
years
must
be
measured
with
three
different
groups
of
students,
negro.
the
seven
now
in
the
record
shows
will
be
graduated
at
the
--
within
two
and
a
half
years,
they'd
be
gone.
now,
when
the
argument
is
made
that
rights
are
not
being
destroyed,
certainly
the
argument
cannot
be
made
that
those
children's
rights
on
through.
they
are
out
--
they
are
out
of
school.
the
second
group,
are
those
that
are
eligible
under
the
plan
to
come
in
this
year
and
the
third
group
or
the
others
in
the
class
which
we
furthered
down
the
line
from
the
high
school
going
down
to
the
elementary
school.
and
so,
we
took
the
position
from
the
beginning
of
this
era,
that
there
where
--
these
three
all
fell
into
to
one
package
and
you
couldn't
strike
one
without
striking
the
other.
and
constantly,
their
argument
is
--
is
understandably
aimed
and
only
the
seven
children
and
to
me,
that's
the
most
dangerous
argument
that
can
be
made.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
we
need
time
to
put
a
plan
into
action.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
a
plan
once
in
action,
in
--
once
in
performance
should
be
suspended
and
stopped
or
halted.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
we've
argued
from
the
beginning
of
this
that
any
application
for
time
is
based
on
the
same
principle
as
those
who
--
and
as
it
was
set
out
in
the
brown
decision
that
you
ask
for
time
originally.
there's
no
difference
and
certainly
public
opposition
is
not
sufficient.
the
most
interesting
argument
i
get
from
the
state,
i
mean
from
the
school
board
is
that
two
partners
come
in,
in
the
case
and
say.”
i'm
not
responsible
from
non-performance
because
my
partner
stopped
me
from
performing.”
i
don't
see
a
better
difference.
the
state
is
a
unit.
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
aimed
against
the
state,
and
all
of
this
panoply
of
state
action
from
the
governor
on
down
is
made
against
them
and
in
that
line,
i
have
to
comment
on
the
continued
resentment
of
the
school
board
at
any
suggestions
that
they
seek
to
relieve
in
hoxie
or
the
clinton,
tennessee
relief.
and
they
say
for
example
that
it's
not
their
job
to
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction.
they
don't
have
to
go
into
court
and
get
an
injunction.
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
go
in
the
court
and
say
to
the
court;
i
suggest
that
your
adjunction
in
your
degree
is
being
violated.
we
are
prevented
from
--
that's
all
they
have
to
do.
and
in
clinton,
the
--
the
judge
called
in
the
united
states
department
of
justice
through
the
attorney
general's
office,
but
there's
no
action
yet.
they
stood
here
this
morning
--
this
afternoon
and
complained
that
they've
been
tied
up
in
litigation
in
this
case
for
three
months.
they
could
very
well
have
been
tied
up
three
months
and
seen
what
could
be
done
there.
and
indeed,
judge
lemley
could
have
done
so.
but
from
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
this
case,
the
record
will
show
that
whenever
there
was
a
move
against
integration
at
central
high
school,
each
step,
the
school
board
made
a
move
to
get
the
negro
kids
out
of
there,
each
step
of
the
way
and
they
are
still
at
this
late
date
arguing
the
same
point
against
public
violence.
and
finally,
if
it
please
the
court,
on
the
question
of
--
although
we
have
respondents,
the
question
of
relief
is
important.
in
our
brief,
we
requested
that
the
court
reverse
--
i
mean
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
the
court
set
aside
judge
lemley's
order
and
reinstate
judge
davis'
orders
and
judge
miller's
order.
but
after
thinking
about
it,
we
would
like
with
the
permission
of
the
court
to
amend
the
--
the
request
of
the
court
that
if
the
court
should
decide
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
that
even
to
--
mandate
to
issue
forthwith
would
not
meet
the
realities
of
the
situation
because
school
opens
on
monday,
and
this
is
a
matter
of
the
mandate
issuing.
and
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
if
the
court
does
decide
to
affirm,
that
the
court
ruled
that
judge
lemley's
order
be
set
aside
and
these
other
orders
reinstated
as
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment
in
this
court.
we
think
that
that
would
give
the
type
of
relief
and
on
that,
i
understand
that
both
sides
of
the
counsel
table
are
in
agreement
as
to
this
court
clarifying
the
situation.
the
only
question
is
about
time
and
i
submit
that
the
decision,
the
clarification
cannot
be
made
in
time
given
at
the
same
time.
and
unless
there
are
some
--
one
other
point
i
forgot
to
mention,
if
it
please
the
court.
on
the
last
appearance,
the
court
questioned
about
judge
davis'
original
opinions
and
original
orders.
we
have
with
us
certified
copies
of
each
of
his
two
original
orders.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
deposit
it
in
the
clerk's
office
in
case
any
one
would
desire
to
see
them
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
submit
on
the
ground
that
the
one
single
issue
in
this
case
where
the
case
stripped
down
is
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
federal
district
court
can
delay
an
integration
plan,
desegregation
plan
already
in
progress,
solely
because
of
violence
and
threats
of
violence.
it's
a
narrow
question
and
i
believe
it's
the
only
question
in
this
case
and
we
therefore
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
imminently
correct
that
it
should
be
affirmed
or
should
be
affirmed
in
such
fashion
as
to
make
it
clear
even
to
the
politicians
in
arkansas,
that
article
vi
of
the
constitution
means
what
it
says.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
have
no
response,
your
honor.
