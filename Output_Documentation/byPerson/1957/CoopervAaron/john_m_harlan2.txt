justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
on
september
8th
was
the
postponed
opening
day,
is
it
8th
or
the
15th?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
doubt
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
by
virtue
of
the
postponement
of
judge
lemley's
second
order,
of
judge
lemley's
order,
that's
the
only
intervening
circumstance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
few
questions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
taking
the
complete
good
faith
in
the
school
board
and
i
for
one
certainly
accept
it
without
reservation,
how
can
you,
from
the
point
of
view
of
judging
this
case,
divorce
the
action
of
the
state,
which
you
very
frankly
in
your
brief
say
was
an
action
designed
to
frustrate
the
good
faith
of
the
action
of
the
school
board,
how
can
you
divorce
that
in
judging
the
issues
in
this
case
from
the
position
of
the
school
board?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that,
mr.
butler
assuming
that
the
state
authorities
gave
you
unequivocal
assurance
that
the
school
board
will
be
backed
up
by
the
state
authorities
in
implementing
this
plan,
would
the
board
still
be
asking
for
a
go
ahead?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
state
or
federal
authority?
justice
john
m.
harlan
will
you
be
asking
of
delay?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
the
essence
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
essence
of
your
position
is
that
the
school
board
finds
itself
in
a
position
it
does
because
of
the
break
down
of
the
enforcement
activity
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
arkansas.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
on
page
29
of
your
brief
you
criticize
the
federal
government
for
not
giving
--
having
given
the
school
board
adequate
protection,
and
then
you
go
on
and
say
no
protection
is
to
be
expected,
in
two-and-a-half
years
it
will
be
wise
to
suspend
operations
for
that
period.
do
i
correctly
infer
from
that,
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
adequate
protection,
adequate
backing
and
enforcement
is
given
to
the
school
board,
then
you
see
no
need
for
any
different
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
presupposes
does
it
not
mr.
butler
that
the
leadership
in
your
state
is
going
to
take
some
affirmative
step
to
relieve
the
public
opinion
in
that
direction.
you
point
out
in
your
brief
that
one
of
the
factors
that
school
board
is
confronted
has
been
because
of
the
enactment
of
the
state
laws
opposing
integration
that
that
has
led
people
to
believe
and
the
support
the
governor
has
given
to
those
movements,
that
all
those
have
combined
to
lead
people
to
believe
that
somehow
rather
despite
the
constitution
and
everything
else,
there
are
valid
ways
the
state
can
delay
or
defeat
this
integration.
now
if
the
federal
courts
themselves
are
going
to
take
a
step
to
delay
on
the
premises
that
you
have
stated
implementation
of
this
decree,
why
isn't
that
delay
going
to
lead
and
spell
for
more
hope
on
the
part
of
oppositionists
to
integration
that
maybe
this
thing
can
be
ultimately
defeated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
all
you
are
suggesting
is
a
delay
in
your
argument?
