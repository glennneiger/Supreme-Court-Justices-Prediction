justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that
bill
passes,
i
take
it
the
board
order
will
be
subordinated
to
the
legislative
direction,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
about
--
i
think
you
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
which
order
of
judge
davies,
the
original
order
approving
the
plan
proposed
by
the
school
board
was
that
you
stated
by
judge
miller.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
judge
--
what
judgment
of
judge
davies
later
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
repeated
in
effect
that
other
than
the
order
relating
to
the
intervention
of
truth
didn't
deal
with
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
looking
for
it
in
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
never
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
am
i
right
in
understanding
the
meaning
of
various
opinions
that
after
the
original
order
of
the
district
court
presided
over
by
judge
miller
in
which
he
canvassed
the
order
of
the
school
board
at
length.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
issued
an
order
for
its
carrying
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
judge
davies
appears
on
the
judicial
scene
on
the
basis
of
a
petition
or
whatever
it
was
called
by
the
school
board
itself
asking
for
instructions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
separate
things.
they
first
ask
for
instructions
in
view
of
the
imminent
or
actually
executed
order
of
governor
for
the
troops
to
enter,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
exactly
what
i
want
to
know.
were
these
two
separate
legal
pieces
of
papers
filed
by
the
school
board,
one
for
instruction
and
another
and
a
separate
petition
by
them
to
be
allowed
to
postpone
the
direction
theretofore
given
by
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
your
understanding,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
order
was
not
sought
to
be
brought
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
very
well
bring
it
here,
since
you
were
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
board
was
satisfied
so
they
wouldn't
bring
it
here
and
you
will
rest
it
on
the
ground
as
affirmed
by
the
district
court,
as
confirmed
by
the
district
court
and
the
district
court's
decree
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there
is
a
difference
between
a
justiciable
issue
and
eventually
succeeding
on
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
they
have
no
justiciable
issue,
they
have
a
justiciable
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
you've
asked
for
in
your
petition
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me,
what
consideration
relevant
to
determining
whether
the
stay
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated,
what
method
of
equitable
jurisdiction
for
this
court's
power
over
the
lower
court,
what
matters
that
are
relevant
to
determining
whether
that
stay
should
be
vacated
would
not
be
relevant
in
determining
whether
judge
lemley's
original
order
should
be
vacated?
why
do
you
–
why
does
–
what
legal
consideration
is
there
for
vacating
judge
lemley's
stay
disregarding
the
fact
that
he
has
been
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
has
taken
action
on
it
and
has
reversed
it
and
has
then
decided
to
grant
a
stay
of
its
reversal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
maybe
a
very
good
reason
why
you
should
argue
that
the
stay
should
be
vacated,
but
i
do
not
understand
the
argument
that
says
we
don't
have
to
bother
about
that,
we
just
deal
with
judge
lemley's
order
and
vacate
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
merits
in
which
you
use
the
term
'the
merits'
seem
to
equal,
the
same
merits
in
determining
on
the
propriety
of
the
stay
as
in
asking
us
to
vacate
the
order
which
he
originally
refused
to
vacate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
understand
why
you
offer
us
the
suggestion
that
we
don't
have
to
bother
about
the
stay,
we
can
deal
with
judge
lemley,
to
me
that
is
most
unreal
kind
of
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
that
has
been
dealt
with.
this
court
refused
to
deal
with
judge
lemley
order
last
june.
it
remitted
the
appealability
of
that
to
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
eighth
circuit
has
dealt
with
it.
the
eighth
circuit
said
it
was
wrong.
it
then
vacated
--
it
then
granted
a
stay
in
order
to
give
opportunity
under
the
acts
of
congress
to
have
this
court
apply
for
a
certiorari
and
what
you
are
here
for,
here
i
respectfully
submit
is
to
argue
that
that
stay
should
never
been
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
court
as
you
urge
has
power
to
vacate
that
stay
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
no
procedural
entanglements
of
a
court
of
appeals
are
relevant
to
that
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
is
that
if
as
a
matter
of
authorized
congressional
action,
a
petition
for
certiorari
can
be
brought
here
by
the
school
board,
that
such
a
petition
would
raise
claims
so
frivolous
that
there
was
no
justification
for
staying
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
decision
by
judge
lemley
entirely
on
oral
testimony
or
was
there
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
days
was
the
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
are
required
to
judge,
justice
black
that
--
indicate
that
you
have
a
copy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
and/or
mr.
butler,
each
have
copy
of
the
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
accelerate
the
disposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
copies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler
may
i
ask
whether
mr.
marshall
was
correct,
because
i
am
–
inferences
i
drew
from
judge
devies'
--
one
of
his
judgements
that
there
was
two
separate
legal
steps
taken
on
behalf
of
the
school
board;
one,
a
request
for
instructions
and
two,
this
motion
for
temporary
injunction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
combined
he
dealt
with
them,
as
i
read
his
judgment,
he
dealt
with
them
in
a
combined
disposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
maybe
it's
pedantic,
whether
those
were
two
separate
steps
taken
before
and
which
he
then
combined
into
a
single
disposition,
because
he
speaks
separately
of
motion,
his
order
of
september
3rd
and
the
court
having
considered,
having
appeared
(inaudible),
and
that
court
having
considered
the
petition
for
instruction
by
sentencing.
it's
not
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
to
this
case
and
it's
certainly
not,
but
i
just
in
the
interest
of
accuracy
want
to
know
what
the
board
did,
whether
it
asked
for
instructions
and
also
at
the
same
time
asked
judge
davies
to
suspend
this
thing
or
stay
this
thing
for
a
temporary
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
for
my
asking,
it
is
that
the
record
doesn't
set
forth
these
two
documents
and
judge
davies'
own
statements
leave
me
in
doubt,
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
--
their
names
are
physical,
physically
on
the
appropriate
register
of
the
class
to
which
they
were
assigned
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
talking
about
legal
consequence.
i
am
not
talking
about
legal
consequence
but
to
carry
out
justice
harlan's
question
they,
they
were
in
that
school
for
a
year.
they
must
have
been
registered
when
they
were
admitted
in,
was
it
in
'57?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
physically
on
the
books.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
but
for
judge
lemley's
order
they
would
have
gone
back
whenever
the
school
opened
to
their
appropriate
classes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
am
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
plan
which
was
put
before
judge
miller
that
which
he
approved
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
confirmed
has
never
been
revoked
by
the
school
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
applies
both
to
segregated
and
the
central
high
school
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
under
the
plan,
approved,
submitted
by
the
board
and
the
approved
by
judge
miller
a
state
by
stage
carrying
out
the
desegregation
scheme
that
central
high
school
is
the
only
school
in
little
rock
in
which
the
plan
became
operative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
at
central
high
school
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
it
wasn't
the
school
board
that
asked
the
troops?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind,
would
you
mind
either
reading
if
isn't
too
long,
that
well
expressed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
would
you
summarize
what
mr.
blossom
testified
as
to
why
two-and-a-half
and
not
one-and-a-half
and
now
three-and-a-half
were
selected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
lines
must
be
drawn
in
this
world,
but
i
just
wonder
what
his
testimony
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler
why
aren't
the
two
decisions
of
this
court,
which,
the
first
one
based
on
the
constitutional
requirement
that
this
court
unanimously
was
held
compelled
the
constitution
and
the
second
opinion
recognizing
that
this
was
a
change
of
what
had
been
supposedly
the
permission
of
the
constitution,
recognizing
that
and
the
kind
of
light
that
have
been
built
under
the
contrary
conception
said
as
equities
is
always
say
that
you
must
make
appropriate
accommodation
for
the
specific
circumstances
of
the
situation
instead
of
having
a
procrustean
bed
where
everybody
makes
the
cut
off
or
stretch
to
fit
the
length
of
the
bed,
and
who
is
better
to
decide
that
than
the
local
united
states
judges.
why
isn't
that
a
national
policy,
and
why
hasn't
that
national
policy,
why
wasn't
that
enforced
in
little
rock,
in
the
little
rock
district
when
the
school
board
submitted
a
plan
after
mature
consideration,
after
listing
public
support
on
its
behalf
submitted
it
to
the
court
where
it
was
contested
and
the
court
said,
yes
this
satisfies
the
policy
laid
down
the
second
in
the
brown
and
allen
decisions.
why
isn't
that
deference
to
local
situation
in
the
enforcement
of
what
was
laid
down
a
national
policy,
national
policy
doesn't
mean
the
same
thing
must
take
place
in
little
rock,
arkansas
as
in
fitchburg,
massachusetts,
something
yes,
but
not
for
this
kind
of
thing.
and
there
was
a
national
policy
and
the
federal
courts
recognized
it.
it
was
sustained
by
the
district
court
over
the
opposition
of
the
parents
or
whoever
acted
on
behalf
of
these
children
went
before
there
court
of
appeals.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
yes
this
is
fair
carrying
out
of
that
which
the
supreme
court
laid
down.
i
do
not
understand
what
is
meant
by
saying
lets
wait
till
we
get
a
national
policy,
if
that
isn't
a
national
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
governor
is
calling
out
troops,
isn't
the
same
thing
as
the
uncertainty
of
what
the
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
uncertainty
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
action
of
the
governor
under
what
he
thought
was
his
refusal
to
abide
by
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler
i
did
not
mean
to
imply,
i
hope
did
not
carry
any
such
meaning
of
what
is
said.
i
did
not
remotely
mean
to
imply
the
criticism
of
the
school
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
to
justice
black
a
minute
ago
that
the
arkansas
law
is
just
the
opposite
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
pass
things
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that,
that
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
explicitly
a
prohibition
against
pupil
assignment
on
the
basis
of
race?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
sometimes
wonder
why
we
have
elections
and
not
turn
it
all
over
to
polls.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
ever
--
have
we
ever
passed
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
that
wasn't
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
another
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
there
a
difference
between
good
faith
in
the
sense
of
sincere,
honestly
entertained
conviction
and
good
faith
in
throwing
out
your
hand
and
say
we
can't
don't
anything
against
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
mr.
butler,
in
concluding
that
the
position
of
the
school
board
from
the
time
of
its
original
incubation
of
its
plan
and
it's
submission
to
the
court,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
has
never
taken
the
position
that
there's
any
reason
for
not
carrying
out
a
plan
except
the
interposition
of
force,
not
of
its
own
choosing,
but
obstructed
the
orderly
process
of
what
it
had
planned
and
its
original
program
was,
the
obstruction
of
course.
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
they
begun
--
and
so
they
begun
with
the
high
school.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
were
going
to
stagger
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
going
to
gain
experience
through
the
introduction
of
nondiscrimination
in
the
high
school.
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
that
that
plan
was
frustrated
or
obstructed,
not
planning
education
(inaudible)
or
to
the
extent
that
there
was
educational
experience,
tension,
etcetera.
the
cause
of
this
fact
though,
the
real
reason
was
not
anything
due
to
what
the
plan
of
the
board
or
the
experience
gained
there
under
but
what
happened
to
outside
forces.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
talking
about
the
thinking.
but
--
at
no
point,
is
there
any
document
in
which
they
say,
“we
have
now
had
experience,
educational
experience,
and
the
plan
which
we
mature
honestly,
began
to
be
operative
in
the
school
year
of
1957.
the
experience
now
shows
us
that
educationally
speaking,
that
is
not
a
sound
plan.
is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
the
thinking
of
the
school
board
has
originally
contrived
and
divide
and
formulated
was
changed
because
of
educational
experiences
rather
than
because
--
beginning
with
the
governor's
intervention
construes
outside
forces
begun
to
frustrate
and
block,
the
carrying
out
of
what
the
school
board
had
agreed
upon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
because
realities
are
attributable
if
you're
going
to
trace
them
to
their
courses.it
wasn't
any
educational
experience.
it
wasn't
the
feeling
that
you
couldn't
have
colored
children
with
white
children
educationally
speaking
but
because
of
the
intervention
of
outside
force,
forces
were
brought
into
play
which
obstructed
that
which
they
have
so
carefully
planned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
accept
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
say
it's
a
consequence
--
as
a
consequence
of
those
conditions,
educational
results
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
can't
teach,
if
you're
going
to
have
troops
in
the
classroom.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
the
school
board
that
rejected
the
armed
forces,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
order
--
the
copies
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
quite
what
the
case
did,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
your
qualification
as
applied
to
education
could
not
be
fairly
said
to
be
the
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
doubt
you
did,
i
have
no
doubt
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
the
testimony,
both
of
mr.
upton
and
mr.
blossom,
that
indeed
the
position
of
the
school
board
derives
from
the
fact
that
there
was
this
intervention
by
state
authority
or
this
interruption
of
what
was
an
incipient
peaceful
process
which
gave
rise
to
the
difficulties,
which
you
just
rehearsed,
the
state
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
process
which
was
interrupted
by
the
intervention
of
the
militia,
of
state
action
was
as
conceded
by
the
school
board
and
the
superintendent,
a
peaceful
process
underway,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
then,
suppose
everything
you
say
is
so
and
we're
not
suggesting,
as
i
personally
do
not
suggest
you
believe
in
the
inevitability
in
human
affairs,
but
suppose
the
same
circumstances
are
put
to
the
court
of
equity
and
the
district
court
at
the
end
of
two-and-a-half
years,
the
same
exercise
of
discretion
in
regard
for
external
fact
would
justify
a
similar
(inaudible)
or
physically
(inaudible),
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think
it
was
proper,
appropriate,
relevant
for
this
court
to
consider
the
conditions
that
followed
the
formulation,
judicial
approval,
practical
implementation
of
the
plan
adopted
by
the
board?
is
it
relevant
for
this
court
to
consider
the
forces
that
interferes
with
the
peaceful
evolution
of
the
plan
which
they
with
great
care
formulated,
for
which
they
received
judicial
approval,
for
which
at
one
period
the
community
as
i
read
the
evidence
was
on
the
whole,
if
not
enthusiastic
about,
at
least
acquiescence
in
accordance
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
two
things
mr.
butler?
in
the
first
place
i
think
it's
dangerous
to
argue
or
fair
to
analogize,
that
argued
from
physical
factors
of
this
world
to
psychological
factors,
but
in
the
second
place
a
court
of
equity
would
not
be
beyond
its
power
to
require
that
the
bridge
to
restored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
opposition
of
the
people
as
i
read
the
testimony,
which
to
me
is
very
illuminated,
the
opposition
of
the
people
was
engendered
by
action
of
officials,
isn't
that
a
fair
statement?
i
am
not
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
suggesting
it
wasn't
–
it
wasn't
an
inflammable
material
there
but
--
but
the
ignition
came
not
from
the
people
rising
up
but
from
their
incitement
to
action
by
officials,
am
i
overstating
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
that's
what
i
read
in
mr.
upton's
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
position
is
that
the
school
board
promptly
proceeded
to
carry
out
in
good
faith,
it's
(inaudible)
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
not
only
planned
but
it
took
action
upon
its
plan.
its
purposes
confirmed
by
judicial
action
were
crushed
in
through
forces
outside
of
its
own
making
or
outside
of
its
own
control,
and
you
want
maneuvering
time,
you
want
time
within
which
the
school
board
independently
considered
acting
on
its
own,
as
it
were,
can
have
a
situation
in
which
the
former
piece
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
we're
taking
with
actuality,
is
it
not
fair
to
state,
or
rather
i
got
the
impression
from
your
argument
last
time
and
partly
today,
that
there
is
a
body
of
enactment
in
arkansas,
which
helped
to
create
a
state
of
public
opinion
that
is
hostile
to
carrying
out
the
purpose
of
your
original
plan
of
the
school
board
by
way
of
implementing
this
court's
decision
in
desegregation
--
for
desegregation,
and
that
your
argument
was
that
you
do
not
know
whether
or
not
when
those
laws
came
under
challenge
before
your
local
court,
your
state
courts,
they
maybe
declared
unconstitutional
and
thereby
affect
public
opinion
in
support
of
the
board's
plan
rather
in
opposition
to
it,
isn't
that,
wasn't
part
of
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
that
very
invalidation
by
your
supreme
court
public
opinion
which
is
a
fact
to
which
you
constantly
appeal
maybe
seriously
affected
in
favor
of
the
original
plan
of
the
board
or
at
least
in
favor
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
obedience
to
this
court's
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler
when
you
said
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
the
people
of
little
rock
were,
what
was
your
word,
quiescent
or
acquiescent
in
what
the
school
board
did
in
the
beginning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
sufferance,
they
were
not
active
supporters
of
the
law
you
said,
that
was
the
phrase
you
used.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
a
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
on
the
whole
realty
of
any
law
actively
supported
by
the
mass
appeal,
and
the
situation
that
is
described
in
the
evidence
both
by
mr.
upton
and
superintendent
blossom,
i
think
it's
a
fair
description
of
what
takes
place
when
any
new
law
is
changed
to
which
there
is
opposition,
namely
that
the
mass
of
people
on
the
whole
reflect
or
at
least
go
along
with
what
their
leaders
propose
and
urge,
and
that
was
as
i
read
the
testimony,
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
the
way
i
read
the
testimony
of
mr.
upton
and
then
of
blossom,
as
between
the
times
that
the
board
planned,
it
was
confirmed
by
the
court
and
the
later
changes
in
september,
what
1957?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
that,
i
said
actively
supporting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
made
the
difference
as
it
does
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
such
change
of
public
opinion
doesn't
spontaneously
arise,
such
is
not
my
experience
or
reading
or
reflection
on
that
intangible
thing
called
public
opinion,
mere
passage
of
time,
the
mere
passage
of
time
wouldn't
by
itself
change
what
you
indicate
is
this
hostile
attitude
what
was
once
on
sufferance
is
now
hostility,
merely
letting
time
pass
wouldn't
make
another
change
into
the
prior
direction,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler,
would
you
care
to
comment
on
the
suggestions
conveyed
in
the
letters
of
the
attorney
general
and
from
the
city
management,
the
school
board
which
is
now
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
solicitor
general
thought
they
are
relevant
and
he
submitted
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
before
the
court
that's
why
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
may
i
say
this,
what
you
--
your
answer
is
it
were
historical
comment
on
what,
on
what
might
happen,
but
the
attorney
general's
letter,
in
answer
to
my
question
and
you
said
military
force,
the
attorney
general's
letter
suggest
facilities
for
enforcement
other
than
military
forces.
i
was
wondering
if
prospectively
and
not
by
way
of
historic
comment
of
what
might
have
been
done
or
should
have
been
done,
pursued,
do
you
think
--
you
have
any
comment
to
make
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
butler,
your
answer
to
justice
black
a
minute
ago
to
the
question
preceding
which
you've
just
answered,
your
answer
is
if
i
may
say
so
is
about
as
important
thing
as
has
been
said
by
you
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
and
therefore
i
would
like
to
ask
you
whether
i
rightly
infer
the
full
significance
of
what
you
said.
am
i
right
to
infer
that
you
suggest
that
the
mass
of
people
in
arkansas,
are
law
abiding,
are
not
mobsters,
they
do
not
like
desegregation,
but
they
maybe
one,
two
respect
for
the
constitution
is
pronounced
by
the
organ
charged
with
the
duty
of
declaring
it
and
therefore
adjusting
themselves
to
it,
although
they
may
not
like
it,
is
that
the
significance
to
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what's
the
date
of
that
law,
mr.
butler?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
need
to
be
humorous.
the
governor
isn't
going
to
sign
the
bills
that
he
didn't
sponsor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible).
these
bills
or
one
of
the
bills
on
the
governor's
desk
now,
which
if
signed
wouldn't
formally
legislate
this
board
out
of
office,
but
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
it's
provision
would
in
effect
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
transfer
the
present
board's
power
into
some
state
agency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
defunct
this
while
they
still
be
normally
members
of
the
school
board
or
not,
they'd
defunct
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
am
i
wrong
in
recalling
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
school
board
had
aide
ads
merging
there
on
the
population
of
little
rock?
