mr.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
am
clear
about
this
statute
which
i
understand
postpones
the
school
opening
until
september
15th.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
presently
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
september
8th
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
registration
involve?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
where
does
he
register
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
he
go
to
the
school
itself
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
he
has
been
assigned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
don't
quite
get
is
this,
must
register
that
is
register
up
here
at
the
very
school
to
which
the
pupil
has
been
assigned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
these
children
have
ever
appeared
at
the
all
negro
high
school?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
butler
i
think
you
told
us,
the
record
is
here,
do
i
understand
that
all
now
required
to
perfect
your
application
for
certiorari
is
the
filing
of
your
petition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
wondering
mr.
butler
whether
your
argument
in
that
event
would
be
any
different
from
the
one
you've
just
given
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
same
vein
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
butler
as
i
recall
your
argument
last
time,
it's
not
the
position
of
the
board
that
the
decisions
in
the
brown
cases
were
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
as
i
understood
it
and
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
agree
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
leads
me
to
my
second
question.
i
know
that
you
are
familiar
with
clause
3
of
article
6
of
the
federal
constitution
which
requires
every
state
legislator
and
every
state
official
executive
or
judicial
to
take
an
oath
when
he
enters
upon
his
service
to
support
the
federal
constitution,
i
think
the
actual
language
is
to
support
this
constitution,
you
are
familiar
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
then
brings
me
to
this
question
since
as
i
understand
your
answers
and
your
colloquy
particularly
with
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
in
large
part
the
situation
which
prompted
your
petition
to
the
district
court
was
a
situation
brought
on
by
the
active
or
by
actions,
affirmative
actions
of
state
legislature
and
its
governor,
i
think,
i
think
your
brief
also
suggest
something,
actions
on
the
part
of
your
state
judiciary,
not
on
the
side
of
enforcement
of
the
constitution
but
opposed
indeed
in
every
way
that
the
state
can
try
to
that
enforcement.
just
how
was
this
court
in
a
position
to
allow,
or
sanction,
or
approve
a
delay
sought
on
the
ground
that
the
responsible
state
officials
rather
than
be
on
the
side
of
enforcement
of
these
constitutional
rights,
have
taken
actions
to
frustrate
their
enforcement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
of
course
the
very
section
that
i
have
referenced,
referred
to
before,
section
3
of
article
6
puts
the
same
obligation
upon
federal
officers
and
congressmen
and
is
put
upon
state
legislators
and
state
officials,
the
obligation
by
oath
to
support
this
constitution.
and
what
you're
talking
about
i
gather
is
that
it
is
a
default
on
the
part
of
state
officials
and
we
ought
to
expect,
or
you
ought
to
be
able
to
except
is
that
an
assistance
of
the
federal
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
that
statute
become
law,
the
one
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
butler
where
did
the
two-and-a-half
year
interval
derived
from,
was
that
board's
suggestion
or
was
that
--
