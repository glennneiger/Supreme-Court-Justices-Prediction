mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
a
great
interest
in
the
maintenance
and
preservation
of
the
public
school
system
of
this
country.
and
the
government
that
is
the
executive
branch
feels
that
this
court
had
that
heavily
on
its
mind
when
it
passed
on
the
brown
cases.
and
the
time
that
was
given
for
the
consideration
over
a
period
of
four
days
asking
for
briefs
especially
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
any
attorney
general
of
any
state
for
segregation
was
either
authorized
or
permitted.
and
the
care
that
this
court
used
in
assigning
the
task
of
determining
the
plan
and
implementation
of
this
opinion
of
the
court
by
the
local
courts
that
would
no
one
understand
the
situations.
and
then
assigning
to
those
courts,
the
duty
and
responsibility
of
recognizing
in
each
case
equitable
principles
of
law
in
determining
upon
the
method,
procedure
and
timeliness
of
the
action
shows
the
consideration
that
this
court
gave
to
the
preservation
of
the
public
school
system
of
this
country.
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
brown
decision
and
study
as
terms,
you'll
see
that
this
court
with
due
regard
for
the
almost
un-estimated
value
of
the
public
schools
to
the
american
people.
used
every
care
that
it
could
conceive
to
try
to
protect
that
system
provided
the
people
who
were
trying
to
work
in
the
public
school
system
and
as
state
officials
had
a
duty
also
to
preserve
it
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
said
about
the
task
to
try
to
carry
out
the
brown
decision
in
good
faith
in
every
step
of
the
way.
we
all
know
as
lawyers
and
the
public
knows
it
from
its
experience
that
the
courts
have
had
equitable
principles
that
if
it
work
--
that
they
have
worked
with
over
the
according
to
brown
case
centuries
had
worked
--
that
they
have
worked
with
over
the
centuries.
and
according
to
brown
case
in
a
note,
refers
to
that
fact,
a
decision
of
this
court
in
which
that
is
set
out.
and
a
court
of
equity
does
not
ask
people
any
time
or
any
place
to
do
things
that
are
beyond
their
power,
things
that
they
cannot
do
but
they
have
to
try.
they
can't
say
we
are
going
to
stop
obeying
the
laws
today,
it's
difficult.
i
don't
mean
to
infer
in
anyway
a
criticism
of
this
school
board
because
they
have
it
terrible
time.
they
have
had
imposed
upon
them,
action
by
state
officials
who
have
duties
exactly
contrary
to
their
actions
that
no
school
board
should
have
had
to
deal
with,
with
this
difficult
problem.
and
i'm
sure
that
this
court
in
the
decision
of
brown
case,
a
simple
mentation
did
not
want
in
any
way
to
lose
the
public
school
system
in
obtaining
and
enforcing
this
principle
of
constitutional
task.
nor
do
i
believe
for
one
moment
that
the
two
were
inconsistent,
that
it's
impossible
for
all
americans
to
have
their
rights
under
the
constitution
and
be
treated
equally
under
the
law
by
the
government
in
all
its
various
aspects
and
have
to
destroy
the
institution
in
order
to
grant
those
rights.
there
is
ample
provision
in
the
brown
case,
implementing
the
declaration
about
constitutional
law
--
for
time,
if
it
is
actually
needed
in
good
faith
to
try
to
carry
out
this
constitutional
principle.
it
is
all
there
and
no
court
of
equity
in
this
country
would
fail
to
recognize
those
needs
if
they
are
properly
brought
to
its
attention
and
if
the
action
is
in
good
faith
and
everybody
according
to
basic
principles
of
equitable
law
has
done
everything
within
his
power
up
to
that
point,
to
accomplish
the
court's
decree.
that's
when
an
equity
court
comes
in
and
acts
to
help
out
someone
who
has
tried
and
done
his
level
best
in
accordance
with
all
the
means
of
his
command
and
then
ask
for
some
help.
at
that
point,
when
additional
time
is
asked
for,
we
think
this
court
has
made
it
plain
that
there
can't
be
anymore
of
this
talk
about
what
the
law
is,
is
it
what
the
governor
says
today
or
a
sender
says
tomorrow
or
a
governor
of
neighboring
state
--
state
says
the
following
day?
the
law
is
established,
this
country
cannot
exist
without
a
recognition
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
when
it
speaks
on
a
legal
matter,
it's
the
law.
but
there
must
be
a
start,
there
must
be
a
recognition
that
it
got
to
be,
then
there
must
some
kind
of
a
start
and
i
believe
and
do
regard
and
careful
consideration
of
the
manifold
difficult
problems
that
the
south
has
in
this
whole
area,
that
there
isn't
a
place
in
the
country
if
they
have
the
will,
can't
make
some
kind
of
a
start,
even
if
it's
the
smallest
kind
for
it
solving
this
problem,
granting
these
rights
and
working
them
out.
in
some
place,
it
didn't
take
time,
longer
time
in
and
others
and
this
court
recognized
that
and
it
has
the
wisdom
to
choose
the
method
of
the
common
law
which
doesn't
say,
“everyone
has
to
follow
one
pattern,
everybody
has
to
do
it
this
way”
but
it
takes
a
case
by
case
where
you
examine
every
fact,
every
factor
in
your
community,
every
problem
that
the
board
has
to
deal
with
that
is
real
and
then
works
out
the
plan
accordingly.
but
you
must
have
a
start.
you
can't
say
we're
going
to
find
out
what
the
law
is,
and
then
subject
to
really
find
out
what
the
law
is,
we'll
start
someday,
maybe.
there's
got
to
be
a
good
faith
continuous
of
--
of
all
--
and
all
reasonable
means
used,
as
the
government
believes
to
try
to
carry
out
the
plan
once
you
start.
and
above
all,
no
court
of
law
in
this
land,
state
or
federal
can
recognize
that
you
can
ever
vow
to
force
and
violence
in
setting
aside,
faking
or
modifying
a
decree
of
the
court.
the
moment
you
do
that,
you
give
up
law
and
order.
this
country
can't
afford
any
such
price,
no
one
can
neither
the
southerner
and
westerner
from
my
country,
the
far
west
to
the
east.
we
have
paid
too
great
a
price,
not
only
as
americans
but
the
human
race
come
this
far
along
the
road
of
lawful
action
and
a
rule
of
law
to
give
it
up
when
someone,
even
the
small
group
as
in
this
case,
only
25
in
the
school
used
force
and
violence
to
scare
out
the
enforcement
of
a
court
order.
and
then
any
change
must
provide
active
steps
and
progress
during
that
modification.
can't
just
hold
it
all
in
a
base
and
say
maybe
the
climate
will
change.
maybe
more
people
will
agree,
so
we
can
see
where
the
weight
of
opinion
is
whether
it's
with
the
courts
or
against
them
when
we
start
to
enforce
the
law.
as
agreed
in
this
case
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
take
the
action
as
proposed
and
we
think
that
you
have
to
start
back
at
the
lemley
decision.
we
think
that's
where
the
error
occurred
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
judge
lemley
to
stay
his
order
because
he
was
changing
the
status
quo.
the
negroes
were
in
the
school,
they
were
under
the
plan
at
the
time
of
his
decision.
and
so,
at
that
point,
when
he
was
taking
them
out
of
the
school,
he
was
changing
the
status
quo
and
that's
where
the
error
occurred.
now,
we
think
there's
no
reflection
on
the
eight
circuit
in
setting
aside
the
stay
of
the
eight
circuit
because
we
--
we
--
that
that
court
had
in
mind
that
in
the
ordinary
procedure,
this
matter
would
reach
this
court
and
that
probably
this
issue
should
be
decided
at
least
by
a
denial
of
service
by
this
court
in
the
final
analysis.
and
that
it
was
--
with
that
in
mind,
but
with
this
court
sitting
as
a
complete
court,
we
think,
that
there
could
be
no
purpose
in
leading
that
order
in
effect
because
the
court
could
determine
this
matter
properly
whether
there
was
a
basis
for
certiorari
and
then
proceed
to
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
action.
and
i
hope
i
can
argue
to
justify
such
an
unusual
action.
it
is
not
on
unprecedented
as
the
clerk
--
as
counsel
has
conceded.
but
it
is
very
unusual
for
this
court
and
i
want
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
have
asked
that
it
be
filed
during
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
during
argument
and
you
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
have
passed
upon
the
question
of
stay
with
the
--
by
passing
upon
the
merits
and
losing
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
we
have
gone
into
the
merits
of
this
case
with
the
belief
that
we
felt
that
that
was
our
duty
to
the
court
because
one
of
the
--
the
great
elements
or
the
important
elements
of
the
question
of
the
stay
is
the
probability
of
success
on
appeal.
and
the
courts
have
said
that,
this
court
and
others
many
times
that
if
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
of
success
on
appeal,
then
the
stay
should
not
be
granted.
so,
we
felt
that
we
had
to
face
up
before
the
court
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
this
court
to
grant
any
relief
on
a
petition
of
certiorari
on
the
merits
or
we
had
to
say
to
the
court,
a
stay
is
reasonable.
even
though
in
balancing
the
equities
we
might
lean
towards
going
back
to
reserve
the
status
quo
that
existed
when
judge
lemley
started.
we
would
still
have
to
say
to
the
court
that
if
there
was
something
in
the
merits
of
this
case
that
deserved
it,
that
a
stay
might
be
reasonable
and
would
have
been
entirely
a
different
argument.
though,
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
nothing
to
this
case
that
would
justify
this
court
ever
granting
certiorari
or
acting
upon
the
merits
of
it.
and
there
is
no
probable
success
that
could
be
obtained
by
the
petitioners
in
--
in
this
action,
because
under
the
law,
they
are
not
entitled
to
relieve
at
the
hands
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
our
position.
now,
the
whole
matter
boils
down
as
we
see
it
to
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
eight
circuit
said.
the
negroes
did
nothing
to
cause
this
situation.
all
the
difficulty
that
you
have
is
force
and
violence
that
was
developed
by
a
relatively
small
group
of
people
who
were
opposed
to
the
implementation
of
this
decree
of
the
court.
it
appeared
inside
the
school
and
outside
of
the
school.
but
that's
all
it
was
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
finding
the
facts
as
they
were
found
by
the
lower
court
said
that
they
could
not
accept
the
conclusions
of
that
court.
they
found
--
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
cause
--
the
cause
and
effect
of
that
action
throughout
was
opposition
to
this
court's
decision
and
the
implementation
of
it
and
with
the
use
of
force
and
violence.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
the
case
is
referred
to
by
counsel,
that
you
cannot
accept
force
and
violence
as
a
justification
or
modification
of
a
decree
that
there
is
no
basis
in
this
whole
situation
except
to
that.
now,
there
is
a
further
fact
and
further
claim
that
there
was
a
deterioration
of
educational
standards
in
this
school
because
of
the
implementation
of
this
decree.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
deterioration
was
not
due
to
the
implementation
of
a
decree
or
any
act
to
these
colored
children
but
was
due
to
these
people
using
these
unlawful
acts
of
violence
and
force
to
try
to
defeat
the
decree,
the
decision
of
this
court
and
its
implementation
and
that
that
could
never
be
a
ground
for
any
kind
of
relief.
of
course
this
court
already
anticipated
that
grounds,
that
the
vitality
of
the
decision
could
not
be
defeated
by
any
--
any
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
populace
as
it's
been
argued
before
this
court.
the
court
went
into
--
in
some
detail,
examples
of
various
types
of
problems
that
anticipated
the
school
districts
might
have,
that
could
be
considered
not
merely
in
the
implementation
of
the
original
order
or
plan
but
for
changes
as
time
develop
to
show
that
those
changes
became
necessary
in
the
operatin
of
the
plan.
but
of
course,
nothing
like
force
and
violence
or
opposition
to
the
decision
itself
was
recognized.
in
fact,
the
court
(inaudible)
would
not
recognize
that.
i
don't
mean
to,
in
these
remarks,
to
criticize
the
school
board.
i
do
--
do
not
want
it
to
be
construed
in
that
manner
but
i
do
think,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
school
board
did
not
exhaust
all
of
the
things
that
they
could
have
done
to
try
to
solve
the
situation.
and
i
--
they
probably
could
not
be
blamed
or
because
of
the
harassment
that
they
suffered
but
when
you
considered
the
matter
in
a
court
of
equity,
you
have
to
recognize
that
as
a
crime
first
consideration
have
they
exhausted,
the
various
steps
that
they
might
take
to
carry
out
the
court
order
before
they
ask
for
remedial
relief
against
it.
there
are
two
respects
that
the
school
district
did
not
do
what
it
might
have.
they're
referred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals.
one
was
to
seek
a
hoxie
or
clinton
type
of
injunction
against
the
acts
of
people
who
are
making
all
the
trouble
for
them.
now,
it's
clear
in
the
record
that
they
knew
the
names
of
the
various
people
in
the
organizations
who
are
engaged
in
the
opposition
and
leading
and
participating
as
clear.
so,
they
have
the
ability
and
they
can't
regain
say
that
they
were
officers
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
it
was
their
official
duty
to
do
what
they
could
and
they
should
have
resorted
to
the
courts
without
such
injunction
and
we
believe
that
would
have
made
a
material
difference.
if
after
such
an
injunction,
there
was
a
violation
to
such
an
extent
that
the
lawful
forces
in
the
area
would
bear
in
mind,
have
the
primary
responsibility
in
this
country
to
maintain
law
and
order,
could
not
maintain
law
and
order.
and
the
other
forces
that
might
be
called
upon,
the
assistance
of
the
federal
government
were
unable,
then
we
would
have
a
different
situation
for
an
act
of
court
to
consider
but
they
didn't
do
that.
and
that
is
an
important
aid
that
they
could
have
obtained
for
themselves
before
they
appealed
to
the
court.
there
is
no
question
of
what
there
could
have
been,
firmer
discipline
within
the
school
itself
and
that
it
would
have
aided
materially
in
maintaining
the
educational
processes
on
a
level
these
children
both
white
and
colored
were
entitled
to.
but
when
you
talk
about
a
deterioration
of
the
educational
process
in
this
school,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
things
that
all
educators,
certain
teachers
would
recognize
is
that
part
of
the
educational
process,
is
the
attitude
and
conduct
of
the
teachers,
the
personnel
of
the
school
and
the
children
themselves.
and
part
of
their
responsibility
is
to
get
across
to
those
teachers
and
the
teachers
to
get
across
to
the
children,
and
those
that
are
in
the
educational
process.
the
responsibility
to
enforce
the
laws
that
we
do
live
in
a
country
where
we
seek
to
maintain
law
and
order
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
that
the
constitution
and
each
of
the
rights
that
every
citizen
has
under
it
is
precious
to
everyone
of
us.
not
just
the
rights
that
i
like
and
want
for
me
or
that
you
like
and
want
for
you
but
all
of
this,
for
every
man
and
woman.
and
that
if
you
teach
these
children
in
little
rock
or
any
other
place
in
the
country,
that
as
soon
as
you
get
some
force
and
violence,
the
courts
and
law
on
this
country
are
going
to
bow
to
it.
they
have
no
power
to
deal
with
it.
they
will
give
way
to
it.
we
change
everything
to
accommodate
the
(inaudible).
i
think
that
you
destroyed
the
whole
educational
process
then
and
there.
if
out
of
this
difficult
and
undesired
situation,
the
people
of
little
rock
and
these
children
who
shouldn't
be
hurt
by
these
problems,
learn
that
constitutional
rights
in
this
country
are
precious
that
they
have
a
duty
to
these
negro
boys
and
girls
in
this
community
to
help
them
get
their
constitutional
right.
and
this
constitutional
right
happens
to
be
the
right
to
enter
a
school
at
any
(inaudible).
but
someday
they
will
want
other
constitutional
rights
and
be
able
to
exercise
them,
freedom
of
speech
in
the
press
and
everything
else
that
we
consider,
so
wonderful
in
our
form
of
government.
and
you
can't
tear
down
part
of
those
rights
without
losing
others
in
the
process.
and
there
isn't
any
part
of
this
country
that
doesn't
have
a
tremendous
state
in
maintaining
each
and
all
of
those
rights
for
all
of
its
people.
and
i'm
confident
that
as
the
years
go
by
where
people
of
the
south,
as
a
people
will
realize
that
they
have
a
steak
in
each
american
citizen
being
a
full
citizen
with
full
and
complete
rights
like
any
other
and
they
will
be
anxious
to
support
and
fight
for
that
at
every
opportunity.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
now
at
the
crossroads
in
this
important
question.
the
people
of
the
country
are
entitled
to
a
definitive
state
on
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
force
and
violence,
opposition
to
the
court's
decision
aren't
enough
for
not
merely
getting
a
modification
to
try
to
adapt
the
real
problems
after
they
have
exhausted
their
remedy.
but
to
just
hold
everything
up
and
goes
back
with
as
step
taking
everybody
out
that
you
tried
to
believe
in.
and
the
basic
question
all
there
really
is
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
we
stand
as
a
government
of
the
united
states
and
all
of
its
power
and
strength,
as
well
as
its
consideration
of
the
difficulties
and
problems
that
are
real,
that
people
have
in
trying
to
carry
out
quarrels.
we
insist
that
there
must
be
a
rule
of
law,
that
we
will
not
abandon
for
a
moment
the
heritage
that
has
been
delivered
up
to
us
by
the
efforts
of
man
over
centuries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
comes
to
this
court
and
asks
to
promptly
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
reinstate
the
order
of
judge
davis
and
make
the
judgment
or
order
of
this
court
in
such
form
that
it
will
be
effective
without
the
problem
of
mandate
or
other
procedures
upon
notice
to
the
parties,
so
that
the
action
will
be
noticed
to
all
interested
parties
at
the
earliest
possible
dates
and
certainly
before
school
opens
on
september
15.
we
think
that
this
case,
as
i
told
the
court
before,
involves
the
question
of
maintenance
of
law
and
order,
not
only
in
this
community
and
the
state
of
arkansas,
but
throughout
this
country.
the
brown
decision
as
the
government
interprets
and
understands
is
quite
different
from
what
was
related
to
the
court
by
counsel
for
the
school
district.
this
court
said
that
segregation
in
public
school
system
maintained
by
the
state
is
unconstitutional.
it
thereby
declared
that
it
is
a
constitutional
right
of
people
not
to
be
segregated
by
reason
of
race
in
the
attendance
of
public
schools.
now,
a
constitutional
right
is
what
we
regard
in
this
country
as
the
most
precious
rights
of
all
the
legal
rights
we
have,
because
it
is
declared
in
our
basic
document
creating
a
union.
and
constitutional
rights
are
present
and
perceived
rights
and
this
court
had
that
in
mind
in
its
consideration
of
the
second
brown
decision
and
what
kind
of
relief
should
be
granted.
it
was
greatly
disturbed
and
i
--
i
for
one
was
also
disturbed
and
i'm
sure
other
counsel
were
about
the
question
of
whether
there
can
be
a
postponement
for
one
moment
of
the
present
and
personal
constitutional
right.
and
it
seemed
to
us
and
i
think
the
court
deliberated
and
thought
it
through
that
the
right
has
been
declared
and
then
it
was
a
consideration
not
of
how
long
you
can
postpone
these
rights.
that
argument
was
made
to
this
court
in
the
first
brown
case.
it
was
said
here
time
after
time.
“if
you
just
leave
us
alone,
we'll
handle
this
problem
ourselves
and
we'll
give
them
equal
protection
under
the
laws,
just
give
us
time,”
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
the
same
argument
was
made
at
the
time
of
the
argument
about
relief
and
the
court
rejected
it
again,
but
the
court
said,
“the
principle
you
must
consider
in
this
matter
is
that
this
relief
is
to
be
given
forthwith
unless
there
are
equitable
factors
which
you
with
the
burden
of
proof
can
show
justify
some
delay
of
this
constitutional
right.
but
the
principal
is
that
you're
entitled
to
the
right
forthwith
unless
there
is
proof
that
satisfies
a
court
that
there
has
to
be
a
delay,”
and
that
delay
should
be
for
the
very
shortest
time
possible
under
the
efforts
of
everyone
in
good
faith
to
give
to
these
people
the
rights
that
they
have
been
entitled
to
for
many
years.
that's
the
way
we
read
the
brown
decision
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
said
in
clear
and
unequivocal
terms.
now,
the
desegregation
of
schools
has
gone
forward
in
many
areas
of
this
country.
it
has
gone
ahead
in
the
border
states,
many
areas
without
any
difficulties
whatever
and
in
some
of
the
areas
of
even
of
the
deeper
south.
what
is
there
in
this
community,
little
rock
and
arkansas
was
different?
certainly,
people
with
the
pigment
in
their
skin,
black
or
white
were
involved
in
most
cases,
in
most
areas
where
the
schools
were
desegregated
without
trouble
between
them.
the
element
in
this
case
is
lawlessness.
it
is
a
community,
a
small
number
at
first
at
least,
maybe
more
later
who
decided
they
were
going
to
defy
the
laws
of
this
country
and
i
say
to
you
that
that's
a
problem
that's
inherent
in
every
little
village,
great
city,
or
country
areas
of
this
united
states.
there
isn't
a
single
policeman
that
isn't
going
to
watch
this
court
and
what
it
has
to
say
about
this
matter
that
doesn't
have
to
deal
with
people
everyday
who
don't
--
who
don't
like
the
law
he
is
trying
to
administer
and
enforce.
and
he
has
to
go
against
that
public
feeling
and
will
and
do
his
duty.
that's
the
responsibility
of
every
man
in
this
country
that's
fit
to
occupy
public
office.
now,
there
is
another
thing
that
i
object
to
in
the
brief
of
the
school
board
here
and
in
the
argument
and
that's
this
idea
that
there
are
two
sovereignties,
one
on
this
side,
one
on
this
side
and
they're
equal.
let's
see
how
they
fight
it
out
and
we'll
join
up
with
the
one
that
wins.
there's
nothing
to
that
stuff
and
that's
all
it
is.
this
country,
a
union
was
created
because
of
the
need
that
the
states
found
for
some
kind
of
union
that
would
resolve
the
bitter
controversies
that
arose
between
the
states
and
it
was
because
this
confederation
was
so
unsuccessful
in
trying
to
carry
on
a
government
for
the
people
in
this
small
country
then
that
it
was
decided.
that
was
a
major
force
in
the
creation
of
this
united
states
and
that
was
back
in
1787,
a
long
time
ago.
and
in
the
consideration
of
the
problem,
what
they'd
lived
through
for
years
in
this
unsuccessful
government
that
they
had
to
deal
with,
they
poured
over
the
problem
of
what
are
you
going
to
do.
we
want
to
keep
these
two
sovereignties.
we
want
to
keep
the
benefit
of
the
state
and
the
union.
the
states
to
carry
out
the
function
of
local
order,
maintaining
law
and
order
and
the
various
functions
of
the
state
government
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
national
government
with
all
of
the
functions
that
were
delegated
with.
but
they
passed
the
laws
in
a
confederation.
the
laws
were
good.
you
look
on
--
you
look
at
them
on
the
books
and
you'll
find
many
of
them
were
excellent
laws,
but
the
states
decided
which
ones
they
were
going
to
enforce
and
some
they
did
and
some
they
didn't.
and
so,
you
had
havoc
and
this
country
had
great
difficulty
in
maintaining
the
revolutionary
war
in
part
because
of
the
condition
of
its
government
and
the
fact
that
it
could
not
get
support
for
the
laws
that
were
passed
that
would
not
be
enforced.
so,
in
their
contemplation,
the
founding
fathers
went
over
this
matter
very
carefully
and
they
finally
concluded
that
there
was
only
one
way
to
handle
it
and
that
was
by
article
vi
in
the
constitution.
and
in
that,
you'll
recall
the
supremacy
between
a
conflict
or
in
a
conflict
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
is
disposed
of.
in
our
basic
governmental
document
for
all
time
and
it
says
this
constitution
and
the
law
is
pursuant
to
it
and
the
treaties
made
under
its
authority
of
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
now,
how
anybody
could
say
there
could
be
any
doubt
about
it
with
that
in
our
basic
constitution?
it
seems
to
me,
impossible,
but
they
didn't
leave
it
just
to
that.
they
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
going
to
be
binding
upon
all
the
courts,
not
only
the
federal
courts
but
all
the
state
courts,
all
the
courts
of
this
country
wherever
they
sit
are
bound
by
that
law
not
withstanding
any
laws
to
the
contrary.
what
else
could
they
do?
this
was
their
major
problem
in
the
government
they
had
just
had
that
was
so
unsuccessful.
they
decided
that
everyone
who
was
an
official
in
the
legislature
or
the
official
of
the
government,
not
only
the
federal
government,
but
of
also
of
every
state
in
the
union
should
take
an
oath
to
support
this
constitution.
and
it
was
done
deliberately
and
purposefully
to
deal
with
this
very
problem,
so
that
each
and
every
one
of
them
would
feel
obligated
as
a
man
regards
his
oath
to
carry
out
the
laws
of
this
country.
and
then,
after
that,
this
constitution
was
not
imposed
upon
any
states
or
any
people
of
this
country.
it
was
submitted
to
them
for
their
vote
and
they
have
ratified
it
because
they
wanted
it
and
they
have
always
wanted
it
and
they
want
that
provision
in
it.
so,
i
say
to
you,
if
the
school
board
has
any
doubt
about
what
the
law
is,
it
can
turn
to
the
constitution
that
it
is
under
oath
to
support
just
as
the
members
of
this
court
and
myself.
and
in
accordance
to
the
manner
in
which
they
have
regard
integrity
of
their
oath,
they
can
find
where
they
should
start
to
find
the
law
and
i
say
to
them,
“if
they
can't
find
it
for
themselves,
they
should
look
first
to
the
constitution.”
that's
what
the
constitution,
our
basic
document
says
and
then
they
can
look
to
any
federal
laws
or
treaties.
and
then,
they
can
look
down
to
see
if
there
are
anything
in
the
content,
if
there
is
anything
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
or
the
state
laws
or
their
own
regulations
that
they
should
enforce,
but
i
say
i
think
without
any
proper
challenge
that
their
obligations
before
this
country
in
their
community
and
before
this
court
is
to
use
all
the
power
that
they
have
and
exhaust
it
to
try
to
perform
that
oath
and
first
start
out
with
trying
to
carry
out
the
obligations
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
now,
the
indication
in
this
brief
--
argument
is
that
the
school
board
has
found
out
how
the
people
of
this
community
feel,
how
strong
the
feeling
is
against
the
desegregation
of
schools
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
of
united
states.
and
so,
their
plea
actually
to
this
court
is
very
simple.
let
us
wash
our
hands
of
it.
it's
a
difficult
problem
and
i
don't
mean
to
minimize
for
a
moment
that
it
isn't
difficult,
but
i
don't
think
anyone
in
public
office
was
trying
to
do
the
right
thing.
he
has
ever
had
an
easy
time
of
it.
he
has
difficult
problems,
difficult
decisions
to
make
and
if
you
respect
his
conscience
and
his
honor,
he
tries
to
carry
it
out
to
the
best
light
he
can
see
regardless
of
any
force
or
violence
or
mass
opposition.
i'm
not
willing
to
recognize
that
under
the
law,
the
school
board
can
separate
itself
from
the
state
of
arkansas.
it
is
one
of
the
governmental
instrumentalities
of
that
state.
this
state
action
we're
talking
about
is
a
state
action
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibited.
and
when
the
state
is
acting
in
violation
of
the
rights
of
these
people
under
the
constitution,
whether
the
school
board
participated
in
it
itself,
whether
it
sort
of
washed
its
hands
of
it
or
stood
aside,
it
is
still
bound
by
it
because
it's
in
privity
with
it
and
this
court
must
look
through
it
as
a
legal
proposition
and
see
that
this
in
fact
is
state
action
that
occurred
all
the
time
to
make
it
difficult
for
this
program
to
be
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
none
of
the
proposals
here
for
delay
comply
with
any
of
the
requirements
suggested
by
this
court
in
the
second
brown
decision.
it
requests
for
delay
and
modification
of
the
plan
should
be
made,
none
of
it.
during
the
argument,
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
it
prior
to
that
time,
it
was
fully
clarified.
we
want
to
do
nothing,
just
nothing.
we
won't
try
to
educate
the
people.
this
is
an
educational
process.
at
least
they
could
come
forward
and
say,
“we'll
tell
the
people
that
this
supreme
court
has
spoken.
that's
the
law
of
the
land.
it's
binding.
we've
got
to
do
it.
the
sooner
we
do
it,
the
better.
let's
get
started
at
it.”
they
could
at
least
come
forward
and
say,
“we
would
try
to
educate
the
people.”
the
school
board
tried
to
educate
the
people
during
these
two
and
a
half
years,
but
that's
what
they
should
do.
but
they
have
a
duty
as
a
citizen,
the
highest
duty
of
a
citizen
to
obey
the
law
and
to
support
this
constitution.
they
could
at
least
offer
that
in
every
court
they
have
appeared.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
one
time,
but
i
think
that
all
of
the
presentation
before
the
court
would
indicate
that
the
educational
process
in
that
regard
could
be
worked
on
much
greater
and
it
could
be
continued
at
some
length.
now,
the
real
suggestion
is
if
you
give
us
delay,
maybe,
there
is
no
assurance.
that
certainly
is
clear
in
this
argument.
maybe,
we
will
be
able
to
have
the
complexion
or
the
attitude
in
the
community
change.
maybe,
the
majority
will
change
and
at
least
be
acquiescent
to
the
school
board's
program.
but
how
if
there
is
no
--
nothing
that
is
going
on
that
if
the
courts
themselves,
acquiesced
in
this
delay,
can
you
expect
that
all
of
a
sudden
the
climate
is
going
to
change
and
be
in
favor
of
giving
these
rights.
i
think
it's
an
impossible
suggestion.
i'd
like
to
make
one
statement
about
the
phrase
all
deliberate
speed.
some
comment
has
been
made
from
time
to
time,
that
that
was
a
phrase
that
this
court
adapted
that
had
no
particular
meaning
and
it
should
be
clarified
as
though
it
was
coined
for
the
occasion
of
the
second
brown
case,
it
was
not.
it
is
an
expression
that
has
been
known
to
the
english
chancery
law
for
many,
many
years.
it
is
the
newest
by
this
court
in
several
decisions.
first
time
that
i
ran
across,
it's
being
used
and
i
may
not
have
found
the
first
one.
it
was
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
222
u.s.in
virginia
against
west
virginia.
it
includes
both
the
elements
of
acting
deliberately
and
with
speed
and
i
think
it
was
carefully
chosen
because
of
the
problems
that
the
court
recognized
their
work
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
there
had
to
be
a
deliberate,
careful
exclusion
and
inclusion
in
each
case
in
order
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
getting
this
constitutional
right
into
being
as
rapidly
as
possible
throughout
this
country
and
preserve
the
public
school
system
which
was
the
objective
of
this
court.
and
in
conclusion,
let
me
say
that
on
this
supreme
court
building
has
carved
the
inscription
“equal
justice
under
law”.
all
americans
take
pride
in
this
controlling
principle
of
our
government.
it
is
there
as
a
reminder
of
a
great
objective
of
this
court
in
all
of
its
decisions.
now,
in
the
gravity
of
this
new
challenge
to
constitutional
rights,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
each
time
that
it
becomes
an
issue,
the
court
must
say
in
a
manner
that
cannot
be
misunderstood
throughout
the
length
and
breathe
of
this
land,
there
can
be
no
equality
of
justice
for
our
people
if
the
law
steps
aside
even
for
a
moment
at
the
command
of
force
and
violence.
