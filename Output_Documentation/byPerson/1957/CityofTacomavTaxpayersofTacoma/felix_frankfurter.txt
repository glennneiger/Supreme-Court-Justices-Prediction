justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ought
to
know,
but
i
don't.when
was
it
--
what
was
the
tenure
of
this
--
the
period
for
this
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
fifty
years,
the
usual
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
--
am
i
justified
in
i'm
inferring
to
what
you
didn't
say
is
the
present
objection
by
a
state
ground
was
not
urged
before
the
power
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
we'll
deal
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
extent
that
it
wasn't
the
case
before
the
commission
or
is
there
anymore
than
you
present
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
this
point,
on
the
visibility
of
the
city
to
exercise
in
their
domain,
the
u.s.
state
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
wrongly
understand
it
was
also
a
party
before
the
federal
power
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
--
the
statutes
meaning,
the
federal
power
act
or
state
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
by
--
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this.
so,
i
understand
that
the
precise
issue
of
the
limitation
upon
the
city
of
tacoma
according
to
washington
law,
the
constitutional
statutory
was
disempowered
to
exercise
eminent
domain
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
adjudicated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
feeding
examples?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
question,
whether
the
city
of
tacoma
according
to
state
washington
laws,
assuming
that
to
be
controlling,
had
power
to
exercise
eminent
domain
necessary
to
enjoy
this
license?
was
that
issue
at
all
in
controversy
before
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
cannot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
totally
different
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
section
21?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
federal
power
act,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
perhaps,
i
will
jus
tell
you
a
little
bit.
the
claim
now
made
that
tacoma
has
as
its
power
of
eminent
domain
necessary
to
execute
or
enjoy
this
license
is
derived
according
to
specific
alleged
limitation
in
washington
law
or
worked
out
by
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
to
me
that's
not
--
is
important
enough
to
be
delivered.
so,
i
understand
then
that
the
present
claim
that
under
washington
law
as
declared
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
tacoma
has
no
power
to
be
the
agent
to
--
to
enjoy
this
or
to
carry
the
advantages
and
responsibility
that
it's
like
--
which
is
now
declared
as
i
understand
this
by
washington
supreme
court
laws,
the
law
of
the
state
that
that
issue
explicitly
was
not
before
either
the
power
commission
or
the
ninth
circuit
when
the
license
was
challenged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
it
was
somehow
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
ordered
then
--
perhaps
we
could
find
--
it
was
ordered
then
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
state
of
washington
from
then
attacking
the
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
this
is
in
affirmative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
--
and
you
say
it
further,
do
you
--
i'm
not
saying
whether
you're
right
or
wrong,
but
there
was
nothing
even
in
federal
law
or
the
nature
of
the
litigation
or
washington
law
that
would
have
precluded
the
state
when
it
challenged
the
license,
to
challenge
it
at
--
on
the
ground
which
is
now
deemed
fatal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
such
questions
involved
in
the
first
iowa
case,
namely,
whether
the
holder
of
the
license
was
empowered
or
disabled
by
state
law
to
be
the
holder
of
a
license?
was
that
question
at
all
in
first
iowa?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
merely
--
unless
i
--
i
just
remembered.
i
thought
that
is
number
--
that
i
wrote
to
them.i
thought
it
was
that
i
thought
you
ought
to
find
out
iowa
law
from
iowa
and
not
from
the
power
commission.
now,
of
course,
i
loyally
accept
what
was
being
cited,
but
i
just
want
to
know
whether
i'm
right
in
thinking
it
wasn't
this
kind
of
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
something
you
--
you
can't
argue
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
arguing
it--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
you.
but
in
this
case,
this
iowa
case,
you
have
in
effect
the
state
law
has
overwritten
the
state
constitution.
the
city
of
tacoma
can
enjoy
and
said,
you
can't
carry
out
with
the
light.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.but
the
fact
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
decided
it,
is
for
us
as
much
state
law
as
though
it
were
written
in
terms
in
the
washington
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
suggesting
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
not
the
problem.
we
did
not
have
that
situation
in
the
first
iowa
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
didn't
even
have
a
prohibition.
you
simply
had
to
broadcast
that
the
counsel
was
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
the
state
of
washington
wants
to
obliterate
--
the
city
of
washington
never
intend
to
be,
would
it
survive
that
obliteration
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
carry
out
this
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
will
happen
to
the
license,
mr.
ely?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
draw
--
you
do
draw
this
picture
without
the
evidence
in
your
rejection
of
my
suggestion
as
a
result
will
rest
with
the
constitution
is
supposedly
between
an
explicit
statute
and
the
law
is
declared
as
a
matter
of
common
law
authority
you
think
by
the
state
supreme
court,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
conferring
your
power
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
man
to
whom
it
is
granted
can
exercise
it.
one
doesn't
necessarily
or
logically
follow
with
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
with
you,
if
i
may
say
so,
but
there's
still
a
difference
because
that's
one
thing
for
them
to
say
that,
as
i
agree
with
you,
that
the
federal
power
of
eminent
domain
doesn't
derive
or
isn't
a
confirmation
of
state
power.
it's
inherent
or
whatever
you
call
it.
it
belongs
to
the
government
as
of
its
own
right
and
it
may
use
whatever
agency
it
please,
but
it
doesn't
follow
because
limitations
upon
receiving
the
value
or
the
advantage
or
the
need
of
eminent
domain
are
barred
by
state
as
against
one
of
its
agencies.
that
is
much
of
an
interference
with
the
eminent
domain
power
of
the
federal
government
because
it
can
choose
and
select
its
own
agency
free
from
any
burden
or
disability
created
by
a
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't.
my
point
is
that
by
denying
in
one
of
its
creation,
the
power
to
receive,
it
isn't
making
much
of
an
end
note
on
the
federal
power
of
eminent
domain
because
the
federal
power
is
free
to
select
somebody
who
isn't
so
disabled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
our
federalism
does
not
preclude
a
state
from
being
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yet
--
yet,
you
agree
that
that
which
so
frequently
been
done
in
the
american
municipal
history
for
one
reason
or
another,
to
--
to
destroy
a
municipality
by
joining
it
to
another
one,
smaller
or
larger
and
merging
it
or
making
it
a
county.
a
state
has
that
power
and
yet
it
could
then
defeat
this
like
--
you
agree
to
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seemed
to
exist
in
the
way
in
which
pittsburgh
seems
to
exist
in
the
hunter
against
pittsburgh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
exist
by
just
adding
another
territory
to
it
and
calling
it
a
new
municipality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
get
a
situation
where
such
an
arrangement
would
be
as
--
this
court
would
be
justified
in
saying
that
this
is
blind,
it's
a
chance
not
only
of
exercise
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
control
of
a
municipality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
32
federal
9.
justice
felix
frankfurter
32
federal
9.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
put
this
for
you
to
choose
what
you
discuss
or
not,
but
i
should
think
it
is
a
matter
of
considerable
interest
to
the
power
commission
as
to
what
the
course
of
proceedings
are
when
there's
ample
opportunity
for
upholding
of
a
petition
or
an
application
for
a
license
to
have
all
the
issues
that
go
to
the
very
root
of
granting
the
license
is
voted
off
in
such
a
proceeding.
i
should
think
that's
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
federal
power
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
any
--
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
suggested
that
they
could
just
postpone
this
case
a
week
or
so
if
consent
would
be
forthcoming?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
suggesting,
though,
mr.
ely
properly
enough
do
what
things
he
could
in
the
duration.
you're
not
suggesting
that
this
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
was
designed
--
it
was
designed
to
take
this
particular
utilization
that
tacoma
is
the
bearer
or
the
endower
of
eminent
domain
by
the
federal
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reason
is
somewhat
to
take
the
limited
time,
but
it's
one
thing
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
say
you
can't,
although,
you
have
general
jurisdiction
over
negligence
cases.
you
can't
take
a
federal
employer's
liability
negligence.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
withdraw
the
whole
domain.
the
court's
liabilities
in
the
courts
of
new
york
can
yet
require
those
courts
to
sit
in
federal
employer
liability
cases.
so,
it's
a
very
different
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
court
has
recognized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
makes
to
me
a
lot
of
difference
whether
this
is
speaking
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
maybe
justified
as
a
general
determination
of
the
municipal
powers
of
the
city
of
tacoma,
not
designed
to
defeat
this
very
exercise
it
settled
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
think
is
that
neither
you
nor
mr.
ely
if
you
do
not
say
this
is
really
the
kind
of
thing
that
replicates
to
another
thing.
this
is
really
an
effort
to
defeat
ad
hoc
an
exercise
of
federal
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
stated
there
is
no
point
of
sharing
differences
that
we
count
on
the
same
side,
but
i
must
ask
you
to
move
whether
you
also
take
the
distinction
that
(inaudible).
it
means
this
declaration
of
state
law
by
the
supreme
court
and
of
all
as
alike
prohibition
of
power
of
tacoma
to
expedite
eminent
domain
either
by
statute
or
constitutional
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
also
understood
you
did
reject
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
the
suggestion
that
this
is
a
design
ad
hoc
determination
at
end
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
is
it
a
question
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
litigation
on
the
license?
you
said
there's
no
power
to
resume
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
for
those
--
before
you
get
to
the
court,
why
was
it
not
enough
for
permission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
asking
for
matters
outside
--
outside
the
record
of
counsel's
new
brief,
that
very
conduct
of
the
litigation.
i
want
to
know
why
as
a
matter
of
law
and
now
to
say
that
the
state
which
has
raised
this
objection
before
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know,
but
why
when
the
question
of
issuing
the
license
or
not
or
the
matter
of
examination
by
the
commission,
what
legal
reason
is
there?
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
one
(inaudible)?
what
legal
reason
is
there
why
the
state
of
washington
didn't
--
should
not
then
have
said
what
made
the
claim
then,
that
you're
now
making
today,
namely,
the
disability,
the
intricacy
of
the
city
of
tacoma
that
who
have
--
has
power
of
eminent
domain
necessary
to
inspect
the
--
this
budget.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
major
difficulty
in
the
way
of
the
state
of
washington,
in
making
that
claim
at
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
tdid
congress
decide
--
unless
i'm
fully
wrong,
whether
or
not
that
claim
was
determinable
without
the
court's
review
would
not
have
here
by
the
commission
is
a
different
story
from
what
we
just
got
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
could
have
been
projected
into
the
proceedings
before
the
power
commission
on
the
granting
or
withholding
the
rights,
then
is
there
any
reason
why
it
should
not
also
have
been
projected
into
the
appeal
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
united
states?
what
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
might
have
lost
in
making
the
point.
that
isn't
the
question.
the
fact
is,
whether
there
was
any
barrier,
any
legal
barrier
against
washington,
then
taking
the
position
which
they've
taken
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
that
we
--
that
english
question
as
we
believe
is
what
is
in
this
court,
we
believe,
was
coupled
if
fact
if
you
consider
you
consider
the
difference
of
the
english
that
those
who
believe
with
following
the
result
then.
what
of
state
property,
undoubtedly
state
property,
the
federal
government
can
detach?
i'm
referring
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
official
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
--
i
understand
that
they
had
this
past
record
--
tacoma
then
pierce
county.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
citizens
of
pierce
county
by
appropriately
by
following
the
procedure
outlined
in
the
statute
authorizing
the
erection
of
a
public
utility
to
the
power
district,
that
they
could
establish
themselves
into
public
power
district,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
practicality.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
procedure
if
they're
going
to
ask.
they
could
have
established
certain
districts
and
do
i
likely
infer
to
what
you've
said
that
i
--
i
can
understand
that
they
could
--
they
would
have
the
power
to
condemn
this
fishery,
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
now
construed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
--
the
decision
which
has
-
is
here
on
the
review,
the
decision
to
which
as
a
matter
of
--
of
legal
reason
and
implication
of
the
statute,
not
by
virtue
of
any
statute
or
constitutional
provision,
that
as
tacoma
is
the
creature
can't
take
property
that
belongs
to
creator,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
in
substance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
apart
from
what
the
opinion
is
telling
you,
has
that
been
the
current
--
is
there
a
practice
that's
been
accepted
if
i
went
to
sit
around
in
washington
law
if
i
could?
would
i
find
that
that
has
been
the
trend,
the
march
of
decisions
or
outlooks
or
the
disposition
of
your
court
shouldn't
have
come
as
a
surprise
to
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
they
have
to
cross
(inaudible)
or
to
head
on
to
their
own
scheme.
i
mean,
they
--
some
of
their
rights
were
affected.
but
as
to
the
fishery,
director
of
fishery,
did
they
resist
the
motion
insofar
as
one
could
tell
for
this
in
the
execution
of
their
responsibility
to
fisheries
was
there
some
of
the
authority
of
the
government
and
the
government
gave
direction
to
which
the
bureau
of
fishery
is
their
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
game
department.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
case
in
the
court
if
the
united
states
could
have
filed?
is
there
--
is
that
a
negative
impression
to
imply
that
there's
some
question
in
your
mind
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
in
the
decision
of
this
court
to
uphold
this
as
a
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
you
mr.
donnelly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
your
argument,
i
did
remember
i
understood
you
(inaudible)
you
argued
that
what
the
power
commission
itself
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
not
to
authorize
condemnation
as
such
but
as
it
were
contingent
condemnation
in
order
to
save
the
hatchery,
is
that
correct?
that's
what
you
--
you
pointed
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
page
24,
they
indicated
the
threat
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
stop
and
influence
and
therefore
they
directed
on
page
25
studies
in
the
interest
of
conservation
and
replacement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
in
my
simple
mind
that
what
you
the
reason
to
that
you
said
(inaudible)
you
have
said
that
although
tacoma
in
view
entering
in
this
provision
is
not
debarred
from
carrying
on
through
eminent
domain
the
likeness
which
it's
got.
it
in
fact
is
disregarding
the
condition
of
the
license
by
its
destructive
(inaudible)
destructive
mode
of
proceeding,
is
that
right?
is
that
the
cause
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
finish
it.
and
if
that
be
so
and
you
can
correct
me,
if
that
so,
and
i
would
like
to
know
why
the
state
didn't
ask
for
an
injunction
specifically
forbidding
that
mode
of
proceeding
rather
than
an
injunction
saying
you
haven't
got
any
license
at
all.
would
have
you
--
you
haven't
got
the
power
of
eminent
domain
under
the
license.
have
i
made
myself
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it
--
if
i
understand
your
argument
and
i
can
understand
you
are
saying
that
inquired
the
procedure
for
protecting
the
action
of
state
washington
law
board
incorporated
as
it
were
by
implied
reference
by
the
licensee
of
tacoma.
i
can
understand
that
argument
and
therefore
i
can
understand
that
the
complaint
or
a
claim
restricting
and
defining
tacoma
to
carrying
out
its
license
without
exfoliation
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
have
no
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
they
will
going
to
do,
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'd
like
for
illumination
on
as
you
say
that
i'm
taking
step
of
your
brief.
you
indicate
how
such
a
project
can
be
carried
out
in
order
to
give
both
power
and
a
place
of
fishery.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
the
state
has
outlined
a
specific
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
indicated
that
the
power
commission
in
granting
that
license
didn't
mean
--
would
just
seem
to
disregard
the
state
procedure
for
the
protection
of
the
fishery.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is,
why
don't
you
specifically,
hold
tacoma
to
the
protection
of
the
fisheries
in
the
way
which
your
state
law
provides,
instead
of
arguing
the
abstract
question
whether
they
have
power
to
condemn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
could
cross
claim,
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
may
i
ask
you?
would
you
be
here
with
the
state
of
washington
opposed
to
tacoma's
proceeding
with
this
project
which
is
acting
under
this
license?
if
the
state
of
washington
thought
that
it
was
carrying
out
what
the
commission
called
(inaudible)
to
us
on
page
25.
would
you
be
here
if
the
state
of
washington
was
satisfied
that
that
which
the
power
commission
directors
in
its
portion
to
direct
to
us
on
page
35
where
conscience
is
being
competent
with
each
other
now,
will
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
won't
you
ask
us
to
direct
to
enter
such
a
decree
that
they
should
carry
out
that
what
you
say
is
entirely
inquired
by
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
is
not
so
that
the
power
commission
has
ample
power
to
extend
the
time
to
complete
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
if
--
if
the
state
of
washington
say,
“tacoma
has
the
right
which
by
the
implication
that
it
leads
or
what
the
power
commission
said
for
the
conditions
under
which
the
license
was
granted
requires
certain
action
by
it
to
protect
the
fisheries
of
the
state.
it
wouldn't
be
an
advisory
speaking
for
this
court
to
say
you
can't
go
ahead
and
destroy
that
fishery
without
having
the
necessary
substitution
of
protection
providing
for
it.”
that's
not
an
advisory
opinion.
that's
carrying
out
--
that's
carrying
out
the
terms
of
the
license
and
protecting
what
you
claim
and
i
can
see
the
judgment
is
to
sustain
and
a
presentation
having
advisory
of
the
speculated
project.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
normally,
that's
a
very
different
claim
from
having
an
action
to
this
court
as
practice
is
made
that
the
city
--
that
the
state
and
the
city
has
eminent
domain
power
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
that's
for
me
a
much
more
complicated
question
than
say
live
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
license
and
the
reason
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
under
your
view
as
i
understand
it,
under
your
view,
they
do
not
have
to
get
a
new
license.
they
simply
have
to
carry
out
the
expressly
implied
conduct
that
that
might
be
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
what
it
is
at
that
time?
i
understand
that
but
none
as
to
the
protectorate
with
which
you
are
concerned,
namely,
the
protection
of
the
hatchery.
if
they
get
--
if
they
get
it
and
they
go
before
the
power
commission
and
get
an
extension
and
whether
they
can
get
an
extension
or
not
is
to
consider
the
power
commission
for
the
reason
that
the
government
is.
but
assuming
they
get
an
extension
to
carry
out
this
license,
they
can
satisfy
you
if
they
protect
the
hatchery
in
the
way
in
which
you
suggest
it.
the
power
commission
was
meant
to
give
protection
to
the
hatchery.

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
--
what
you
say
that
the
license
which
was
given
to
them
contemplated
that
they
do
not
destroy
this
hatchery
or
explore
that's
equivalent,
is
that
true?
and
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
say
you
even
deny
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
truth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
you
might
disagree.
that
they
must
be
destroyed
--
fish
resources
of
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
and
you
say
you
point
out
that.
that's
what
the
commission
agreed
to.
the
commission
didn't
say,
“we
must
have
power.”
and
no
fish
--
they
--
they
denied
--
they
set
the
exact
competence
there,
didn't
they?
they
said
we
can
have
both
power
(inaudible)
and
all
your
industries
as
far
as
i
follow
you
is
that
there
are
people
with
fish
and
power.
but
you
say
tacoma
is
making
no
provision
to
secure
fish
or
to
maintain
fish
resource.
so,
that's
your
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
don't
care
about
that
aspect
of
competition.
the
lawyers
always
want
to
have
straight
competition
of
value.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
never
announce
and
after
that
competition
that
the
creatures
have
to
figure
there
is
a
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
is
that
too
much
of
an
outstanding
question
at
that
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
inviting
us
refer
to
the
lower
court
on
subject
(inaudible)
spelled
out
which
is
necessary
and
this
license
has
which
is
explicit
conditions
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
of
delays
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
going
to
be
part
of
the
extension.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
about
facilities-wise
any
suggestions
that
i
think
was
suggested
that
i
think
mr.
donnelly
made
to
wit,
that
in
this
injunction
that's
set
in
style
and
the
freedom
that
you
thereby
imply
against
tacoma,
he
may
take
an
irreparable
(inaudible)
decree
to
take
an
irrevocable
step
structured
to
the
hatchery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
was
exactly
what
he
said.
