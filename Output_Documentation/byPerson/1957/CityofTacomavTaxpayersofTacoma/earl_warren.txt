washington
and
robert
schoettler.
mr.
ely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
matter
of
interest,
how
far
ahead
had
it
proceeded,
mr.
davis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis
in
this
--
there's
no
question
as
in
the
case
as
you
see
it
as
to
whether
the
city
of
tacoma
could
--
could
condemn
all
the
rest
of
this
land
other
than
the
hatcheries.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
describes
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
--
the
state
of
washington
permits
private
utilities
to
condemn
state
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lynch.
maybe
you
could
answer
that
question
before
you
start
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
agency
in
the
or
corporation
in
the
state
of
washington
that
under
your
law
could
--
could
condemn
your
state
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
alright.
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
let's
say
that
tacoma
was
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
this
is
a
licensee
of
the
federal
government
in
this
--
in
instance.could
he
then
condemn
the
state
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
that
has
been
held
that
--
that
the
licensee
is
the
--
but
the
federal
government
stands
in
their
shoes
in
the
government
as
the
situation
as
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
by
--
by
federal
law.
have
it
that
the
--
doesn't
its
licensee
have
the
right
to
condemn,
normally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
now
that
--
i'm
not
talking
about
what
21
does.
i
just
--
i
just
asked
you
whether
you
would
be
here
if
this
happens
to
be
a
city
from
another
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
a
private
corporation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
or
out
of
your
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
a
public
utility
--
public
utility
organization,
the
only
one
that
the
state
of
washington
would
permit
to
do
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
it's
a
fact
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
are
10
dams
in
this
one
project
that
--
that
they
have
to
start
every
one
of
them
within
this
initial
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
$7,000,000
to
get
started.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
lynch,
thus
your
argument
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
in
circumstances
of
this
kind
where
the
--
the
state
refuses
to
convey
its
property
for
this
public
purpose,
that
the
only
licensee
that
is
open
to
the
united
states
government
for
valid
purposes
is
the
public
utility
district
in
your
state
and
that
regardless
of
whether
there
is
any
public
utility
district
covering
the
particular
territory
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
that
does
in
that
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
can
answer
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
questions
as
i
could
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
to
know
how
far
we
have
to
go
in
a
decision.
now,
do
--
do
you
go
that
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
circumstances
you've
got
on
this
case.
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
any
other
licensee
open
to
the
federal
government
in
the
state
of
washington
other
than
a
public
utility
if
there
happened
to
be
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
just
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lynch,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lynch,
i
was
wondering
if
in
this
--
in
this
situation
the
state
of
washington
had
not
given
the
right
of
eminent
domain
to
public
utility
districts
that
would
lead
the
united
states
government
with
no
licensees
that
it
could
operate
through
the
government
objective
that
was
here.
could
the
state
of
--
of
washington
in
that
way
entirely
order
the
purpose
of
the
federal
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
to
just
--
should
do
is
as
it
did
here,
just
wouldn't
give
to
anybody
any
--
any
authority
to
condemn
and
the
more
we
had
the
hidden
powers
incident
to
--
to
operate
the
building
and
operating
a
--a
public
or
utility
of
this
kind
but
it
just
wouldn't
give
them
any
power
to
condemn
any
state
property
and
that
situation
of
this
kind
would
leave
the
government
without
any
potential
licensee.
now
--
and
if
that
was
situation
i
take
it
that
the
whole
federal
power
policy
would
be
important
in
that
--
in
that
area.
now
--
now
what
would
be
the
--
the
result?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donnelly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
file.
and
if
they
ask
you
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that
precise
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
with
what
mr.
donnelly?
the
precise
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
an
open
question
that
you
say
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
donnelly,
i
--
as
i
understood
you
to
say
during
the
course
of
your
argument
that
there
was
a
way
--
there
was
a
way
whereby
the
city
of
tacoma
could
condemn
this
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
you
say
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
mean
acquire
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
state
--
would
the
state
have
a
right
then
to
assert
that
they
didn't
want
to
build
facility
and
want
to
stay
where
it
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
fishery
here.
i'm
not
talking
about
a
highway.
i'm
talking
about
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
forced
by
whom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
jurisdiction?

warren
