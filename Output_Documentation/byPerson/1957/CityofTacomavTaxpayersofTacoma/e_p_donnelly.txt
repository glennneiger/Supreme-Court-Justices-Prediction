mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
asked
me
to
give
an
--
an
--
a
citation
not
in
the
briefs.
i
have
prepared
a
short
list
of
additional
authorities
therefore.
and
if
it's
possible
i
would
like
permission
to
file
and
serve
counsel.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
at
the
outset
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
say
that
i
contracted
this
severe
cold
apparently
has
affected
my
hearing.
if
i
do
not
speak
loud
enough,
would
you
please
tell
me
and
be
patient
with
me
if
i
don't
hear
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
thank
you.
i'm
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
washington
and
represent
the
state
and
agree
with
the
position
taken
by
mr.
lynch
with
the
possible
exception
on
his
answers
to
some
questions
regarding
the
authority.
am
i
speaking
loud
enough
--
regarding
the
authority
of
the
pud.
that
question
was
asked
the
attorney
general
categorically.
i
--
in
our
office
we
--
we
write
opinions.
i
wrote
an
opinion
that
it
could.
that
opinion
didn't
prevail.
the
attorney
general
has
not
ruled
and
the
court
has
not
and
no
court
has
ruled.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
could
the
p
--
public
utility
districts
which
i
understood
your
honor's
question,
mr.
lynch.
could
they
condemn
the
state
fish
hatchery?
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
i
think
in
all
honorary,
it
must
that
it
be
and
it
is
an
open
question.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
and
while
we're
in
it,
may
i
--
may
i
give
your
honors
my
reasoning.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
the
answer
--
the
answer
would
be
"no",
your
honors.
if
the
pud
did
what
tacoma
did
in
this
case,
the
answer
would
be
"yes."
and
so
could
any
private
corporation
or
and
the
city
of
tacoma,
if
they
replaced
the
hatchery
before
and
followed
the
statutory
methods.
let
there
be
no
misunderstanding.
there
is
a
way
in
which
the
city
of
tacoma
could
have
acquired
this
fish
hatchery.
and
may
i
rather
follow
that
up
and
then
bring
out
as
i
go
along?
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
the
--
the
question
--
the
case
rather
that
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
asked
me
to
cite
to
your
honors,
is
state
versus
atlantic
city,
23
new
jersey
337,
a
late
case
in
which
chief
justice
vanderbilt
held
for
the
majority
of
that
supreme
court
to
where
the
federal
government
made
--
made
a
grant
to
the
city
of
atlantic
city.
but
that
money
was
--
there
was
then
a
question
how
does
that
was
to
be
divided
or
was
it
--
did
belong
to
city?
did
it
belong
to
state?
and
mr.
chief
justice
vanderbilt
pointed
out
that
that
made
no
difference
to
state
law
or
government.
now,
that
--
that
case
as
i
see
it
is
here,
germane
only,
because
it
illustrates
what
this
case
is
not.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
grant.
there's
--
the
government
is
paying
nothing.
there's
no
reason
from
posing
any
conditions.
the
city
of
tacoma
here
simply
finds
itself
in
the
position
of
having
the
supreme
court
say,
"you
--
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
condemn
the
fish
hatchery"
and
having
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
deny
them
that
relief
and
the
bill
that
they
presented.
so,
they
wished
to
borrow
temporarily
the
sovereign
right
to
condemn
and
still
remain
a
part
of
the
body
of
the
state
and
a
submissive
part
in
all
other
the
respects
that
we
say
they
cannot
do,
urgently
requested.
and
on
the
--
the
proceedings
--
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commission,
i
would
like
to
read
a
short
sentence
from
page
21
of
the
record
towards
the
top
of
the
page
where
the
commission
is
speaking
of
a
report
from
the
united
states
army
engineers
of
this
specific
--
on
this
specific
application.
the
committee
said,
“because
of
the
need
for
correlation
of
power
development
by
local
interests
with
the
needs
of
preservation
of
fishery
resources,
the
--
i
--
i
started
to
read,
too
late.
in
reporting
to
the
commission,
the
chief
of
engineers
says,
“that
no
recommendation
has
been
made
in
--
in
the
review
report
for
development
of
the
cowlitz
sites
because
of
the
interest
of
local
communities
in
undertaking
such
development
and
because
of
the
need
for
correlation
of
power
development
by
local
interests,
with
the
needs
of
preservation
of
fishery
resources.”
in
other
words,
in
1948,
the
chief
of
engineers
recognized
the
local
interest
of
the
city
of
tacoma
in
development
of
the
cowlitz
which
would
render
federal
investments
unnecessary.
that
was
a
prior
report
that
the
government
did
not
take
over.
your
honors,
of
course,
know
that
on
(inaudible)
columbia,
the
government
operates
the
bonneville
and
columbia
dams
and
by
specific
statute
the
secretary
of
the
interior
may
contract
with
the
state
of
washington
to
maintain
fish
hatcheries.
here
is
evidence
that
the
government
is
not
in
this
case.
on
page
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
oh,
yes.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yeah,
absolutely.
when,
though
the
end
that
i
say
it's
not
in
it.
and
that
from
my
standpoint
that
is
a
state
question,
the
city
is
going
to
operate
under
state
law
that
the
government
will
not
operate
it
and
they
--
they
will
--
the
government,
in
every
other
respect
by
state
law,
except
this
one
thing,
they
want
--
that
we're
coming
to
what
they
want
to
do.
now,
the
commission
gave
rather
close,
very
close
attention
to
the
question
of
the
fishery
resources.
remember
the
examiner
had
turned
down
and
recommended
against
the
license
because
of
the
paramount
need
of
fishery
resources.
the
commission
determined
that
at
this
time
there
was
a
need
for
the
city
to
develop
power.
and
at
the
top
of
page
24
pointed
out
that
it's
not
a
question
of
--
as
counsel
has
said,
“a
one
or
the
other.”
it's
a
question
of
both
and
you
can
have
both.
at
the
top
of
page
24,
the
court
points
out,
however,
that
the
fish
ladders
and
such
things
as
were
proposed
to
be
installed
were
rather
experimental
and
would
take
some
development.
and
i'd
like
to
read
the
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
page
24.
and
this
occurs
in
the
opinion
which
is
made
a
part
of
the
order
specifically.
it
has
been
asserted
that
by
the
time
a
satisfactory
evidence
can
be
obtained
as
to
the
success
of
the
fishery
conservation
facilities
proposed
by
applicant,
the
fishery
resources
may
well
be
reduced
to
insignificance.
being
cognizant
of
this
possibility,
we
propose
that
the
hatchery
facilities
be
provided.
here
is
what
i
wish
to
emphasize.
soon
enough
to
assure
initially
maintenance
of
a
sizeable
seed
stock
and
later
to
complement
the
natural
productivity
above
the
dams.
now,
to
be
sure,
who
is
going
to
do
that,
on
the
next
page,
the
commission
says,
“studies
of
these
problems
should
go
forward
promptly
and
we
expect
the
city
either
to
employ
its
own
biologist
or
make
suitable
arrangements
with
the
state
of
washington
for
expert
assistance
in
exploring
all
possible
means
of
working
out
the
details
of
this
and
other
problems.”
your
honors,
when
the
commission
said
that
as
a
language,
it
had
in
mind
that
a
fish
hatchery
can't
be
interrupted
at
--
at
any
specific
time.
these
anadromous
fish
who
have
gone
to
sea
take
two
years
to
come
back.
and
they
said
that
you
must
start
this
soon
enough
to
ensure
initially
maintenance
of
a
sizeable
seed
stock.
that
is,
a
mass
hatchery
--
hatchery
facilities
must
be
provided,
so
two
or
three
years
in
advance,
so
that
there
will
be
no
serious
deprivation
of
fishers
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
license
was
granted
on
that
condition.
now,
if
the
power
commission
had
authority
to
deal
with
whether
or
not
there
should
be
eminent
domain
they
didn't
do
it
because
they
here
said,
“you
can't
condemn
damage
and
take
that
fish
hatchery.
you
must
substitute
for
it
and
replace
it.”
they
had
in
mind,
that
just
as
though
they
said
so.
the
state
statutes
called
to
your
--
your
honor's
attention
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
that
this
hatchery
would
inundate
state
highways
as
well
as
the
fish
hatchery.
and
each
of
those
necessary
governmental
operations
especially
in
highways,
it
is
spelled
out
how
the
city
may
get
the
right
to
flood
those
highways.
they
do
certain
things,
culminating
in
a
new
highway
and
then
the
statute
abrogates
or
vacates
rather
the
old
one.
and
the
economy
of
the
state
of
washington
is
not
disrupted.
you
can't
condemn
without
doing
that.
that
our
court
said
and
on
page
7
of
the
brief,
i
cite
the
case
that
such
a
method
is
exclusive.
in
the
case
of
the
fish
hatchery,
you
do
the
same
when
you
have
new
hatcheries
climbing
up
and
it
--
and
likely
should
have
put
in
--
in
the
--
by
the
dictate
of
the
power
commission
and
when
they
are
then
working.
the
--
this
fish
commissions
simply
declares
that
its
--
it
is
not
necessary.
the
land
is
sent
to
the
commissioner
of
public
lands
and
he
sells
it.
thereof,
i
have
a
little
difference
with
mr.
lynch
on
the
power
of
condemnation.
it
is
my
opinion
that
private
capital,
public
utility
districts,
the
city
or
anyone
else
could
build
that
dam
if
they
followed
that
statutory
method.
but
now
let
us
go
ahead
and
see
what
the
city
of
tacoma
did.
this
may
be
out
of
chronological
order.
this
is
out
of
chronological
order.
but
later
on
in
the
litigation,
on
october
3rd,
1955,
remember
the
license
was
given
four
years
before
in
november
1951.
the
language
i
read
to
your
honors
was
of
the
opinion
of
november
1951,
page
207
of
the
record.
on
october
3rd,
1955,
tacoma
made
an
answer
to
the
state's
cross
complaint
in
which
we
set
up,
which
we
asked
for
an
injunction,
the
injunction
before
your
honors.
they
said
in
this
answer,
“in
--
in
respect
thereto,
tacoma
alleges
the
plaintiff
has
not
yet
entered
into
negotiations
with
said
game
commission
relating
to
the
alteration,
adjustment,
relocation
or
acquisition
of
such
fish
hatchery
and
that
continued
full
use
of
such
hatchery
can
be
had
through
proper
adjustments
and
partial
relocations
thereof
without
diminishing
usefulness,
thereof.”
and
i
skip
a
line,
“that
plaintiff
intends
to
and
will
acquire
either
through
negotiation
and
purchase
or
eminent
domain
proceedings
and
stood
in
prosecutor
in
their
proper
tribunal,
any
and
all
necessary
rights.”
there
your
honors
for
the
first
time
did
we
have
proof
that
tacoma
was
not
going
to
replace
that
hatchery,
hadn't
being
doing
it
and
was
attempting
to
condemn
it.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
certainly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes,
i
did.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes,
quite
clear,
your
honor
and
i
think
i
can
answer.
i'll
be
--
and
well
--
i'm
--
i'm
just
coming
to
that.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
we
didn't
know.
now,
here
in
--
in
--
i
went
of
--
of
chronological
order.
the
--
this
license
was
appealed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
sustained
it.
your
honors
denied
certiorari.
in
that
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
the
capacity
of
tacoma
was
not
before
them
and
that
they
didn't
decide
it,
that
the
power
commission
would
have
no
interest.
now,
the
question
is
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
the
power
commission
would
have
no
--
might
consider
but
would
have
no
authority
to
decide
to
any
question
because
that
was
a
state
question.
now,
you
might
well
ask.
why
didn't
we
at
that
time
come
in
and
specifically
ask,
why
don't
you
tacoma
do
what
the
federal
power
commission
told
you
to
do?
and
my
answer
is
that
we
didn't
know
they
were
going
to
absorb
that
and
didn't
know
until
they
come
and
confessed
it.
let
me
--
let
me
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
--
oh,
pardon
me.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
that
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
that
is
what
i'm
saying.
now,
this
--
now,
in
the
city
of
tacoma,
filed
the
case
first.
that's
this
case
before
your
honors,
as
a
declaratory
judgment
wanting
to
know
if
they
had
power
under
state
law.
if
they
had
the
power
under
any
law
to
initiate
an
act
under
that
license
and
they
didn't
--
they
raised
the
questions.
that
was
in
the
--
was
a
--
weighted
issue
for
several
years.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
we
didn't
know
and
they
--
they
were
--
now,
let
me
read
to
your
honors
what
the
city
said
when
we
found
out
in
here.
four
years
later,
what
we
found
out
what
they
were
going
to
do,
we
thought
maybe
they're
going
to
drop
the
project.
they
were
pressing
it.
let
me,
on
page
231
of
the
brief
--
of
the
record,
pardon
me.
the
city
makes
its
--
its
recommendation
regarding
highways.
it
says,
”the
city
has
not
yet
obtained
the
right
from
the
director
of
highways
under
the
provisions
of
rcw
9028010
to
perpetually
back
and
hold
the
waters
of
the
cowlitz
river
above
said
dams
and
to
overflow
and
inundate
the
state
and
county
highways
thereby,
but
has
submitted
plan,
maps
and
plans
relating
to
such
overflowing
and
inundations
to
said
director
and
has
made
available
to
the
director
of
highways
the
sum
of
$71,000
for
surveys
and
estimate
of
cost
of
relocating
such
highways.”
now,
that's
all
right.
after
all
what
i
was
asking,
was
there
we
assumed
they
were
doing
the
same
with
the
fish
hatchery.
and
they
were
doing
some
things.
they
paid
the
fish
commissions
and
we
raised
the
point
specifically
the
first
time
we
knew
they
said,
what
i
read
to
your
honor,
when
they
said
we're
not
going
to
replace
it.
we
will
buy
it.
we'll
pay
your
money.
now,
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
no,
and
we
hear
the
dam
would
be
built.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
the
dam
would
be
built.
you've
paid
in
what
they
should
have
done.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
would
do
if
it
were
not
for
the
point
which
we
raised
in
the
brief
which
the
solicitor
general
has
mentioned
that
there
is
nothing
now.
no
judgment,
your
honors,
can
make
which
can
be
operated
under
that
license.
there
must
be
--
this
dam
must
be
completed
at
the
--
this
year,
december.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
but
the
solicitor
general
admits
that
there
has
been
an
application
for
it
that's
not
been
acted
upon.
and
this
court
will
not
give
an
advisory
judgment
that
is
of
same
position
that
this
your
honors,
on
the
same
position
the
state
supreme
court
is.
they
said,
"what
shall
we
do?"
that
court
--
this
court
did
not
advise
the
power
commission
how
to
act
on
that
application
or
what
they
should
do.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
and
i
can't
meet
them.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
certainly
can't
introduce
that
but
i
never
thought
the
court
could
do
that.
now,
that
was
okay
but
if
it
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
--
but
i
didn't
think
that
that
was
the
function
of
your
honors.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
if
your
honors
were
in
my
shoes,
and
is
representing
a
defendant
in
a
security
of
judgment
case
which
the
plaintiff
wishes
to
drag
on
year
after
year
and
you
would
assume
if
the
common
member
is
a
part
of
the
state,
you
would
assume
that
you
would
be
advised.
we
were
--
we
thought
that
pertaining
to
where
is
it's
going
a
little
slowly
but
there
would
be
studies
necessary
and
made
and
that
the
city
would
take
care
of
those
things.
when
all
of
the
sudden,
if
your
honors
look
at
the
record,
first
in
june
of
1955,
there
were
they
--
tacoma
filed
an
action
in
the
federal
court
not
to
condemn
the
fish
hatchery
and
everything.
it
was
a
condemnation
action
against
private
parties
which
the
state
was
just
joined.
i
promptly
made
the
motion
and
judge
boldt
ruled
that
mr.
lynch's
pointed
out
that
the
section
21
of
the
--
no
act
of
congress
could
move
the
limitations.
that's
what
they
said.
that's
what
--
and
that
is
correct.
on
june
15th,
that
opinion
letter
from
judge
boldt
came
down.
on
june
21st,
tacoma
without
notice
all
of
a
sudden
sold
its
bonds.
here
is
a
case
that's
been
pending
for
years.no
authority
from
the
court,
they
sold
the
bonds.
on
june
22nd,
they
left
the
contract.
on
june
24th,
we
came
in
with
a
specific,
a
motion
to
--
to
restrain
them
as
possible.
and
the
question
of
condemnation
had
never
been
in
the
offing
either
because
under
the
ruling
of
the
federal
commission
under
their
--
their
common
sense
rule
requirement
that
they
should
replace
this
before
the
fishery
was
destroyed,
we
assumed
they
were
doing
it.
there
could
be
no
res
judicata
in
this
case
and
as
the
circuit
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
they
--
and
it
says
that
the
rule
and
its
ruling
and
the
action
of
commission
is
not
res
judicata.
and
on
the
question
in
this
case
whether
the
first
ruling
on
the
demur
could
be
res
judicata,
your
honors
i
think
if
we'll
accept
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
the
second
opinion
which
says
that
it
was
not
raised
than
their
--
their
question
is
not
res
judicata
and
you
will
accept
the
opinion
of
that
court
now
that
tacoma
does
not,
having
being
in
this
position,
that
it
has
not
the
right
to
condemn
the
hatchery.
now,
it
may
get
a
new
license.
it
may
get
an
extension
those
things
as
may
be
different.
the
legislature
meets
in
--
in
january,
of
course,
and
they
may
start
and
do
as
they
--
they
should
have
done
in
the
beginning.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
hardly,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
they
have
to
either
get
a
new
license
or
an
extension
of
this
one.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
they
couldn't
--
they
couldn't
--
they
would
need
too
many
years
to
do
that
your
honors.
they
would
--
they
would
have
to
build
other
hatcheries
and
let
them
operate
so
the
seed
stock
would
be
there.
now,
it
is
a
new
--
they
must
start
in
the
--
from
scratch
as
you
might
say.
the
--
what
they
have
done
in
this
case
is,
four
years
after
they
should
have
been
--
after
the
case
has
been
started,
raised
the
question
and
say,
"we'll
pay
you
damages."
now,
that
cannot
compensate.
the
state
of
washington
has
different
agencies.
if
one
like
the
city
breaks
another
one,
the
whole
state
believes
and
there
is
no
case
and
there
no
reasoning
which
would
support
the
--
that
the
thing
--
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
five
minutes.
thank
you,
your
honor
--
which
wouldn't
support
in
argument
that
the
state
or
that
the
federal
government
if
it
did
and
it
didn't
here
because
what
they
did
they
said
affirmatively
you
must
--
you
must
--
not
permitted
to
do
this.
you
must
not
--
you
can't
condemn
the
hatchery.
but
there's
no
argument
would
support
that
the
federal
government
or
any
agency
thereof
could
say
to
the
state,
"here
you
use
this
piece
of
land
for
this
purpose
but
through
this
agency
and
not
that
one."
fisheries
is
not
important
and
that's
not
the
judicial
question.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
has
held
that
on
the
facts
before
it
that
the
city
could
not
condemn
that.
that
the
--
the
fish
hatchery,
it
therefore
did
not
have
the
capacity
to
do
so
and
it
carefully
looked
to
see
if
the
federal
power
commission
or
any
or
the
statute
attempted
to
give
that
the
power
and
they
saw
plainly
it
didn't.
on
the
other
hand,
they
said
the
reasoning
was
just
like
the
state
law.
you
must
replace.
they
haven't
done
it.
now
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
--
the
section
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
pardon
me.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
it
disavows
what
your
honor?
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes,
sir.
yes,
i
could.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
and
that
hasn't
in
--
it
is
--
that
is
sufficient.
they
have
no
power
at
this
time
to
--
to
condemn
that
hatchery.
may
i
cite
one
case
not
in
the
briefs,
your
honor?
there
on
the
question
of
state
and
federal
relations,
hopkins
federal
savings
&
loan
ass'n
versus
cleary
to
be
found
at
296
u.s.
315.
in
that
case
from
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
a
state
federal
and
savings
loan
association
sought
to
make
itself
a
federal
savings
and
loan
association.
the
court
--
this
court
found
it
was
a
quasi
municipal
corporation
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
very
careful
--
very
clearly
stated
the
question.
the
controversy
in
each
of
these
cases
is
one
as
to
the
meaning
and
validity
of
an
act
of
congress
whereby
building
and
loan
associations
organized
under
the
law
of
a
state
maybe
converted
into
federal
and
saving
loans
associate
upon
the
vote
of
the
majority
of
the
shareholder
present
at
a
meeting
legally
convened.
wisconsin
planning
these
agencies
in
furtherance
of
the
common
good
and
proposing
to
preserve
them
that
the
good
may
not
be
lost
is
now
informed
by
congress
speaking
through
a
statute
that
the
purpose
and
the
plan
shall
be
ordered
and
destroyed.
and
here's
mr.
justice
cardozo
is
moving.
in
this,
there
is
an
invasion
of
the
sovereignty
or
quasi
sovereignty
of
wisconsin
and
an
impairment
of
its
public
policy
which
the
state
is
privileged
to
redress
as
a
suitor
in
the
court
so
long
as
the
tenth
amendment
preserves
a
field
of
autonomy
within
the
federal
encroachment.
comparing
ourselves
now
to
the
precise
and
narrow
question
presented
upon
the
records
here
before
us,
we
hold
that
the
conversion
of
petitioners
from
state
and
the
federal
associations
is
of
no
effect
when
voted
against
the
protest
of
wisconsin.
we
submit
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
attempt
here.
the
federal
question
is
not
substantial.
there's
no
attempt
to
authorize
the
city
--
the
city
of
tacoma
to
circumvent
state
laws.
but
that
if
there
was
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
no,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
acquire
it
and
build
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
by
first,
building
a
--a
road
here
and
then
the
other
would
be
vacated.
first,
build
a
hatchery
and
then
this
will
be
vacated.
so,
that
the
state's
economy
is
not
disrupted.
this
must
be
--
they
--
they
must
build
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
the
statute
vacates
it
by
automatically,
the
highway,
in
the
case
of
the
highway.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
the
statute
is
not
that
explicit
but
i
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
--
do
not
think
they
would
have
authority
to
say
not.
that
should
be
that
--
i
think
then
that
they
could
be
forced
to
do
it.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
by
the
city
if
they
had
to
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
in
the
state
courts,
of
course.
this
is
a
state
question.
there's
no
question
but
what
--
but
what
this
--
the
--
the
fundamental
fallacy
of
all
argument
is
that
they
assumed
this
fish
hatchery
can't
be
built.
it
can
if
they
had
done
and
if
they
should
do.
now,
if
they
can
--
they
can
still
build
if
they
can
get
another
license
or
amendment.
if
your
honors
will
affirm
the
lower
court,
there's
--
there
is
--
which
you
should
do.
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
city
of
tacoma
to
do
except
to
press
for
an
--
a
--
an
extension
of
time
and
build
a
hatchery
if
they
get
it.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
do
--
i
can
see
that
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
no.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
no.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
where
could
they
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
i
don't
know
where
they
could
get
the
land
but
there
they
--
there
is
--
if
there
is
no
land
then
they
can't
build
the
dam.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
no.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
i
don't
think
that
is
--
should
carry
that.
that
is
exactly
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
no.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
this
license
contemplates
that
they
shall
not
destroy
the
fishery
resources.
they
must
replace
hatcheries
first
--
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
--
long
enough
in
advance.
this
dam
was
not
true.
it
is
--
it's
not
important.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
yes.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
those
are
the
facts.
but
that
we
--
what
the
state
is
interested
in
that
transcended
the
importance
of
this
case
is
that
there'd
be
no
decision
which
would
say
that
a
creature
of
the
state
can
rise
higher
than
his
creator.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
that's
what
i'd
sue.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
that's
why
i
went
down
to
the
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
p.
donnelly
i
believe
i've
exceeded
my
time.
