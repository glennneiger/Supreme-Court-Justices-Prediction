l.
black
does
the
act,
the
federal
power
act
take
any
position
on
admission
by
the
federal
government
and
in
this
case,
the
licensee
does
not
have
power
under
the
state
law
as
it
has?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
washington
statute
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
which
forbid
at
this
point
to
operate
it
now
and
exercise
its
power
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
another
question
(inaudible)
a
license
has
been
granted
that
the
power
plants
do,
the
state
itself
to
abolish
the
municipality
on
the
publication?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
require
that
aliens
--
that
it
seems
to
be
incorporated
on
this
case
or
is
it
a
meaning
of
the
act
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand,
you
could
call
that
(inaudible)
public
utility
district
is
unnecessary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
not
private.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
power
did
the
city
of
tacoma
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
created
by
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
were
the
county
that
had
provided
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
you
that
because
i
have
gathered
in
your
argument
that
you're
making
two
objections.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
one
is
that
the
city
of
tacoma
has
not
been
given
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
won't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
understand.
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
here,
the
scope
of
the
objection
so
far
(inaudible)
that
here
the
city
does
not
have
the
right
to
initiate
proceedings
that
condemns
this
property
whoever
thought
to
find
that
whether
united
states
government
has
it
or
not,
the
city
doesn't
have
the
right
to
do
it,
but
it
is
--
if
someone
with
power
to
do
so
is
to
condemn
that
then
there's
nothing
at
all
in
washington
law
can
bar
the
carrying
out
of
the
federal
command
in
the
city
--
the
city
of
tacoma
that
has
the
licensee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
argument
at
bar
again
this
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
have
to
have
a
greater
power
insofar
as
the
operation
is
concerned?
suppose
that
what
the
supreme
court
would
say,
â€œwe
will
not
let
you
determine
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
(inaudible)
at
21
that
it
construe
and
it
authorizes
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
he
have
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
did
he
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
licensing
as
being
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with

justice
hugo
