mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
power
commission
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
petitioner
of
the
city
of
tacoma.
the
united
states,
including
the
federal
power
commission
has
three
interests
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
the
first,
of
course,
is
in
the
completion
of
the
cowlitz
project
itself.
application
for
which
was
made
10
years
ago
in
1948.
the
license
of
which
was
granted
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
1951,
which
was
--
that
the
license
which
was
--
of
which
was
confirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
1953
and
certiorari
was
denied
four
years
ago
by
this
court
in
1954.
it
is,
of
course,
to
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
that
this
long
delayed
project
be
completed
as
was
originally
anticipated.
at
this
point,
i
think
it
will
be
appropriate
for
me
to
say
that
as
amicus
curiae,
we
did
not
think
it
fitting
for
us
to
discuss
the
issue
of
res
judicata
which
was
a
subsidiary
point
in
the
case
and
perhaps
not
the
one
on
which
certiorari
is
granted.
but
we
have
no
reason
to
disagree
at
all
with
the
position
of
the
city
of
tacoma
that
this
was
an
issue
which,
if
not
raised
before
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
ninth
circuit,
should
have
been
raised
there.
and
therefore,
that
the
--
the
granting
of
the
license
by
the
federal
power
commission,
its
affirmance
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
in
our
certiorari
here,
should
preclude
further
litigation
on
this
subject.
but
as
i
say,
we
do
not
discuss
that
and
i
shall
not
discuss
it
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
embrace
your
statement
because
i
think
it
is
of
great
importance
to
the
federal
power
commission,
and
i
do
think
that
that
--
it
is
appropriate
that
all
these
issues
be
raised
before
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
the
reason
we
did
not
discuss
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
is
we're
amicus
curiae
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
our
time
is
limited.
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
federal
government
is
interested
in
--
in
the
disposition
of
this
case
is
that
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
is
an
important
means
for
the
aiding
the
development
of
water
power
projects
in
the
united
states.
it
has
been
used
in
the
past
and
will
continue
to
be
used
in
the
future.
and
since
private
--
or
public
bodies
are
frequently
licensees
of
the
federal
power
commission,
it
is
important
to
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
power
commission
that
the
full
extent
of
the
powers
under
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
be
presented
to
in
court.
and
the
third
reason
is,
of
course,
that
the
federal
government,
wholly
aside
from
the
federal
power
act
and
section
21
of
that
act,
is
interested
in
maintaining
its
power
under
the
--
and
its
eminent
domain
power
to
take,
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
delegated
powers,
state
property.
now,
before
i
present
the
government's
position
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
mention
two
--
or
two
matters
which
have
been
raised
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent
and
which
will
probably
be
discussed
by
them
at
oral
argument.
the
first
is
a
possible
question
of
mootness.they
say
that
the
license
given
to
the
city
of
tacoma
will
expire
on
--
in
june
1958.
and
therefore,
since
it
is
impossible
for
this
project
to
be
completed
in
the
next
few
months
that
the
issue
of
the
case
is
moot
and
should
not
be
decided.
on
behalf
of
the
federal
power
commission,
we
wish
to
contravene
that
position
completely.
under
section
13
of
the
federal
power
act,
the
federal
power
commission,
though
it
can
only
grant
an
extension
of
two
years
for
the
beginning
of
a
project,
for
the
commencement
of
a
project,
has
no
--
has
no
limitation
as
to
the
granting
of
an
extension
for
the
completion
of
a
project.
this
project
was
commenced
within
the
proper
time
and
the
federal
power
commission
has
before
it
now
an
application
for
extension
of
time
for
the
completion
of
the
project
which
is
within
its
statutory
power.
so,
there
is
i
think
no
problem
of
mootness
in
--
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
am
not
certain
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
but
i
believe
about
$7
million
have
been
spent
and
i
think
perhaps
mr.
ely
would
be
more
specific.
$7
million
has
been
spent
on
the
project.
the
second
preliminary
issue
is,
also
suggested
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent,
is
that
perhaps
there's
no
need
for
this
court
to
decide
the
case
at
all
because
--
because
perhaps
the
state
game
commission
will
now
change
its
mind
in
view
of
the
passage
of
time
and
--
and
agree
to
sell
the
property
to
tacoma
or
to
allow
tacoma
to
replace
the
project.
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
if
that
would
happen,
but
it
does
not,
we
think,
dispose
of
the
case
in
this
court
because
that
there
is
still
outstanding,
the
resolution
of
the
state
game
commission
of
august
1955
which
mr.
ely
mentioned
and
there
is
an
adverse
--
there's
adverse
controversy
between
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
city
of
tacoma
on
the
one
hand
and
the
state
of
washington
on
the
other.
and
as
--
as
the
case
stands
in
this
court,
that
adverse
controversy
is
in
the
posture
to
be
determined
by
this
court,
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
suggestion
is
cryptic,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
frankfurter,
and
i
thought
it
well
to
take
account
of
it
since
i
will
not
have
any
rebuttal.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
counsel
tells
me
it
is
appointed
by
the
--
by
the
government,
but
it
is
an
integral
part
of
--
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
washington.
questions
from
the
bench
prompt
me
to
state
at
the
beginning,
it's
a
two-general
propositions
that
i
think
maybe
helpful
in
understanding
or
in
my
presentation
of
the
federal
government's
position
and
those
two
general
propositions
are
these.
that
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
in
our
history.
in
fact,
it
has
been
common
for
the
federal
government
in
the
aid
of
its
delegated
power
such
as
the
commerce
power
to
make
use
of
and
to
endow
upon
state-created
agencies
various
powers.
this
includes
state
corporations,
state
bridge
commissions,
state
railroads,
and
state
courts.
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with
this.
they've
come
to
it
before
the
court
very
frequently
in
cases
for
instance
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act
in
which
state
courts
are
used
for
federal
purposes.there
is
a
whole
history
which
i
believe
i
will
have
a
chance
to
go
into
a
bit
more
in
the
past,
about
the
use
of
state
courts
and
state
corporations,
particularly
in
the
field
of
railroads
and
telegraphs.
now,
we
draw
from
this
body
of
adjudications
in
the
court,
this
general
proposition
which
we
think
is
all
that
the
court
need
go
to,
to
decide
this
present
case,
and
that's
--
the
general
proposition
is
this.
that
in
aid,
in
exercise
of
its
delegated
power
such
as
the
commerce
power,
the
federal
government
has
the
right
and
the
authority
to
grant
powers
to
state-created
agencies
no
matter
what
the
state
law
may
be
so
long
as
those
additional
powers
are
within
the
general
sphere
of
activity
of
the
particular
state-created
agency,
whether
it
be
a
state
court,
a
state
corporation
or
a
state
public
body
that
is
within
the
general
sphere
of
activity
of
--
of
the
state
body.
mr.
justice
brewer
put
it
over
60
years
ago
in
talking
about
railroad
corporations.
he
said,
“it
is,
of
course,
well
settled
that
congress
can
grant
franchises
to
state
railroad
corporations
beyond
those
granted
by
the
state.”
at
least,
he
said
a
similar
kind
of
franchise.
well,
the
term
franchise
is
--
is
out
of
date
today,
but
the
concept
is
--
the
concept
i
believe
which
i
have
been
stating,
that
is
as
long
as
congress
does
not
go
beyond
the
general
sphere
of
activity
of
the
particular
state
agency,
the
court
or
the
corporation
or
the
public
utility
district,
or
the
city,
or
the
municipality,
congress
has
the
power
no
matter
what
the
state
may
say
to
grant
this
particular
additional
power.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
even
over
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
even
over
the
state's
expressed
objection,
mr.
justice
burton.
now,
what
do
we
have
here?
what
has
been
decided?
what
is
no
longer
in
this
case
as
we
think
very
important.
it
is
terribly
important
that
tacoma
has
the
power
and
has
had
since
1893
to
engage
in
the
business
of
--
of
providing
electricity
and
the
federal
power
act
in
this
instance
recognizes
that
a
municipality
cannot
get
a
license
from
the
federal
government
unless
it
has
such
power.
at
page
51
of
our
brief,
we
quote
section
3(7)
of
the
federal
power
act
which
defines
a
municipality
as
one
which
is
competent
under
the
laws
of
a
state
to
carry
on
the
business
of
developing
and
so
forth,
power.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
has
never
held
in
this
case
that
tacoma
is
disabled
from
--
from
being
a
licensee
under
the
federal
power
act.
it
deliberately
said
exactly
the
opposite
in
its
first
opinion
in
1953,
and
its
second
opinion
which
is
the
one
here
under
review,
did
not
detract
at
all
or
retract
from
what
it
originally
said.
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington,
tacoma
is
a
proper
licensee
for
the
federal
power
commission.the
second
thing
we
think
that
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
it
is
quite
clear
the
opposite,
because
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
the
addition
to
its
opinion
which
mr.
ely
pointed
out
made
it
very
clear
that
all
the
other
claimed
state
grounds
were
invalid
and
had
to
be
disregarded.
so,
the
--
the
objection
to
this,
to
the
power
to
condemn
or
the
capacity
to
condemn
this
fish
hatchery
is
the
sole
issue
left
in
the
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
assume
that
is
not
so.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
will
assume
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
but
i
think
it
in
fairness
to
the
city
of
tacoma
and
to
ourselves,
that
we
do
point
out
in
our
brief
that
we
think
there
is
no
substantial
basis
in
the
prior
law
of
the
state
of
washington
distinguishing
between
capacity
and
power
to
take
state-owned
property.
that
insofar
as
the
supreme
court
of
washington
says,
though
tacoma
may
have
the
power
under
the
federal
power
act,
it
has
no
capacity
to
receive
that
power.we
think
there
is
no
substantial
basis
on
the
prior
law
of
the
supreme
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
on
that
issue
alone.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
would
agree.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
will
assume
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
i
will
assume
that
it
is
not
so.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i've
said
that
tacoma
is
fully
authorized
by
the
state
of
washington
to
engage
in
the
electric
power
business.
and
the
second
point
i
want
to
say
is
that
the
license
granted
by
the
federal
power
commission
has
been
determined
to
be
fully
valid
in
all
of
its
parts
by
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
this
court
refused
to
review.
so,
we
have
here
a
perfectly
valid
license
and
all
its
parts
about
a
license
which
necessarily
requires
the
taking
of
this
fish
hatchery
because
the
fish
hatchery
is
included
within
the
land
which
the
license
requires
to
be
inundated
by
the
reservoir
which
will
be
created
by
these
dams.
the
third
point
as
has
already
been
pointed
out,
that
all
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington
relating
to
navigation,
the
height
of
dams,
diversion,
fish
sanctuary
have
been
declared
to
be
inapplicable
in
this
situation,
both
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
by
the
two
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
this
very
case.
now,
i
come
to
a
point
that
--
that
we
consider
very
important.
tacoma
has
the
general
power
under
state
law
of
condemnation
and
it
has
the
general
power
under
state
law
of
condemning
state-owned
property.
that
is,
if
you
look
at
the
--
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
washington,
they
explicitly
give
to
tacoma
the
power
to
condemn
state
property.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
has
said
in
two
cases,
one
in
the
earlier
case
and
one
on
present
case,
that
they
had
the
power
to
condemn
state
property
if
it's
not
already
being
used
by
the
state
for
some
purpose,
that
it's
lying
idle.
but
that
was
the
earlier
case
of
tacoma
against
state
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
washington
said
that
the
city
of
tacoma
had
the
power
to
condemn
state
property
which
was
not
then
being
used
for
some
affirmative
purpose.
in
the
present
case,
they
said,
“that
does
not
extend
to
a
property
which
is
being
used
by
the
state
for
some
public
use.”
but
going
back
to
what
i
said
before
about
the
general
sphere
of
activity,
we
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
tacoma
has
the
general
power
of
condemnation
including
the
power
to
condemn
under
state
law
certain
state
lands.
also,
as
already
brought
out,
there's
no
question
that
this
hatchery
is
necessary
for
the
completion
of
the
project.
the
state
supreme
court
recognized
that
because
it
--
it
enjoined
the
entire
construction
of
this
whole
project
on
the
basis
that
the
hatchery
could
not
be
condemned
by
the
city
of
tacoma.
so,
it
is
an
essential
integral
part
of
the
project
and
necessary
thereto.
and
again,
all
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
about
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there's
also
no
question
about
compensation
for
the
hatchery.
the
city
of
tacoma
has
offered
either
to
relocate
the
hatchery
or
to
pay
for
it.
so,
the
question
of
compensation
is
not
here.
and
finally,
i
think
it
well
to
stress
as
did
mr.
ely
that
this
project
is
authorized
by
congress
and
by
the
federal
power
commission
under
the
commerce
clause,
one
of
the
clauses
of
the
constitution
which
the
court
has
said
has
endowed
congress
with
plenary
power
within
its
field
and
which
the
court
has
again
and
again
said
(inaudible)
as
to
which
the
court
has
again
and
again
said
congress
must
have
full
power
to
perform
its
functions,
to
complete
its
projects
and
to
do
what
congress
thinks
ought
to
be
done
for
the
promotion
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
the
federal
power
act
does
not
do
that.
it
does
not
grant
a
condemnation
power
to
the
united
states,
but
it's
appropriate
at
this
point
to
mention
two
other
statutes
that
do,
because
i
think
they
point
out
that
the
result
of
this
case
might
very
well
be
a
matter
purely
of
form,
not
of
substance
in
an
area
in
which
form
has
never
been
considered
to
be
important.
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
way
back
since
1890s,
does
provide
that
in
certain
instances
if
a
city
or
a
corporation
desires
to
build
a
harbor
improvement
which
is
--
it
will
then
donate
to
the
united
states
and
it
can't
buy
it
and
--
or
--
or
could
procure
by
purchase,
the
federal
government
will
then
condemn
it
for
the
city,
provided
that
the
city
guarantees
to
the
federal
government
the
entire
just
compensation
and
the
entire
cost
of
the
suit.
in
other
words,
what
happens
is
that
the
federal
government
condemns
the
project
all
the
cost
including
just
compensation
are
paid
for
by
the
--
the
city
or
the
state-created
corporation,
but
the
form
is
used
of
a
condemnation
suit
by
the
federal
government.
now,
that
is
not
provided
in
the
federal
power
act
and
we
think
it's
not
necessary
that
it'd
be
provided.
my
point
at
this
moment
is
that
if
that
were
provided,
you
have
a
difference
of
form
but
not
of
substance.
you'd
have
precisely
that
the
united
states
going
in
and
condemning
this
fish
--
fish
hatchery
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
tacoma,
the
city
of
tacoma
paying
the
entire
cost
of
the
--
of
the
suit
including
the
just
compensation
which
would
have
to
be
paid
for
the
state
of
washington
and
then,
the
united
states
would
turn
over
the
--
the
project
to
the
city
of
tacoma.
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
reason
why
the
implementations
of
the
commerce
powers
of
congress
have
to
be
done
in
that
way.in
fact,
we
think
that
the
substance
of
that
has
really
been
accomplished
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
--
none
--
none
at
all.
not
at
all.
there
is
--
is
nothing
forbidding
tacoma
from
operating
the
plant.
all
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
has
said
is
that
tacoma
is
incapacitated
from
receiving
the
--
from
condemning
the
fish
hatchery
itself.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
has
definitively
not
held
that.
and
i
think
that
to
tell
that
tacoma,
if
it
did
get
the
fish
hatchery,
by
whatever
means,
is
empowered
to
continue
operating
under
the
license.
i
said
before
that
what
--
what
has
been
done
here
is
in
substance
the
same
as
if
the
federal
government
had
condemned
the
land.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
because
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
which
is
printed
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
53,
provides
that
the
land
which
is
to
be
condemned
must
be
in
--
necessary
to
a
project
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
federal
power
commission
is
required
for
the
improvement
of
waterways
and
so
forth.
now,
you
have
a
fish
hatchery
which
according
to
the
very
findings
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
its
order
and
its
license
is
necessary
for
this
project.
it
is
not
as
if
tacoma
went
out
and
said,
“well,
we
think
this
is
good
land
and
we'd
like
to
take
it.”
the
federal
power
commission
has
determined
that
this
land
is
necessary
for
this
particular
project.
the
federal
power
commission
has
also
determined
that
this
project
is
the
one
best
adapted
for
the
comprehensive
development
of
the
water
resources
of
the
northwest
in
that
particular
area.
the
federal
power
commission
has
determined
this.
the
federal
power
commission
has
also
determined
that
no
other
project
could
be
constructed
more
quickly
or
more
economically
than
the
project
which
tacoma
has
been
authorized
to
construct.
and
i
stress
again,
that
was
already
been
brought
out,
that
the
state
of
washington
was
a
party
to
the
proceedings
at
which
these
determinations
were
made
by
the
federal
power
commission.
and,
of
course,
it
opposed
--
it
presented
its
position
on
the
matter
of
fish
and
--
and
the
natural
resources
which
were
--
this
position
was
taken
into
account
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
elaborate
requirements
were
made
for
the
protection
of
the
fish
in
--
on
the
cowlitz
river
in
connection
with
the
project.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
federal
power
act
and
the
court
says
that
a
--
a
voluntary
transfer
of
a
license
requires
the
approval
of
the
federal
power
commission.
what
the
bearing
on
that
is,
we
don't
of
course
authoritatively
know,
but
it
might
well
be
said
that
a
--
an
abolition
by
--
of
the
city
or
an
abolition
of
the
licensee
might
result
in
the
voluntary
transfer
of
the
--
of
the
license
to
the
incorporating
area
and
it
might
require
the
permission
of
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
would
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
point
out
in
the
same
connection
that
i
do
not
see
any
difference
between
the
abolition
of
--
of
tacoma
as
a
city
and
the
abolition
of
a
corporation
or
some
other
public
utility
district.
in
each
case,
the
state
which
created
the
agency
would
have
the
right
to
abolish
it
under
ordinary
law.
i
don't
think
that
cities,
though
they
are
certainly
in
a
sense
more
amenable
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
legislature
than
our
corporations,
stand
on
any
different
footing
on
--
in
this
respect;
that
both
may
be
abolished
by
the
state.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
mr.
justice.
i
would
think
that
the
--
the
--
that
the
project
would
go
on
possibly
subject
to
the
power
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
approve
the
incorporating
area
or
the
successor
or
body
or
whatever
it
is
that
took
over
the
--
the
duties
and
functions
of
the
city
of
tacoma
that
was
relating
to
--
to
electric
power
production
and
distribution.
a
word,
if
i
may,
on
the
statutory
question
of
whether
section
21
is
a
grant
of
the
federal
eminent
domain
power
or
simply
a
venue
provision.
every
time
that
statute,
section
21
has
been
cited
by
this
court,
it
has
always
been
in
terms
of
a
grant
of
power.
it
has
been
the
--
the
lower
courts
have
treated
it
this
way
consistently.
the
legislative
history
which
is
referred
to
in
both
the
brief
of
the
city
of
tacoma
and
of
the
federal
government
indicates
that
there
was
some
objection
to
it
because
it
was
thought
of
to
be
a
grant
of
power
of
the
state
municipalities.
nevertheless,
the
grant
was
made.
the
natural
gas
act,
which
10
years
--
10
years
ago
adopted
the
same
method
for
condemnation
was
considered
by
congress
to
be
a
grant
of
power
and
has
been
construed
by
the
lower
courts
that
way.
and,
of
course,
as
mr.
ely
pointed
out,
such
grants
of
power
have
been
common
throughout
our
history.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
the
word
“all
licensees,”
in
section
21
must
necessarily
cover
cities
and
municipalities.
in
fact,
s
the
provision
was
originally
presented
to
congress
it
covered
only
municipalities
and
public
districts
and
public
service
corporations
and
it
was
broadened
to
cover
all
licensees
so,
it
must
necessarily
cover
a
licensee
which
is
a
city
or
municipality.
i
have
--
in
relation
to
the
--
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
as
a
part
in
this
case,
i
think
i
have
already
stated
in
general
what
our
position
is.
that
--
that
the
federal
government
has
the
constitutional
right
to
confer
upon
the
city
of
tacoma,
powers
which
are
within
the
general
sphere
of
activity
of
the
city
of
tacoma.
the
--
this
has
been
--
been
decided
by
this
court
in
cases
involving
railroads,
bridge
corporations,
telegraph
companies
and
courts.we
think
actually
that
is
--
even
been
decided
with
relation
to
licensees
on
the
federal
power
act.
i
recognize
that
the
first
iowa
hydro
electric
case
in
328
u.s.
did
not
deal
with
this
precise
subject.
but
the
rationale
of
that
case
as
we
read
it,
and
has
apparently
been
read
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
itself
is
that
a
state
cannot
say,
“our
public
utility
districts
or
our
cities
are
disabled
from
performing
--
taking
a
license
under
the
federal
power
commission
if
they
are
otherwise
able
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
business
by
enacting
various
laws
relating
to
navigation
and
so
forth.
it's
important
to
know
that
the
dissent
on
the
first
appeal
in
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case,
that
a
senator
said,
”the
legislature
of
washington,
by
passing
the
fish
sanctuary
act,
by
saying
the
dam
--
the
dams
on
the
cowlitz
river
cannot
be
more
than
25
feet
high.”
that
--
that
the
legislature
of
washington
in
pro
tanto
disabled
the
city
of
--
of
tacoma
from
taking
this
license
and
the
majority
said,
”no,
they
had
no
right
to
do
that.”
the
city
of
tacoma
is
still
a
perfectly
good
licensee.
now,
we
think
that
kind
of
argument
goes
as
well
to
the
issue
which
is
--
that
first
appear
in
this
case,
too.
that
is,
the
power
of
the
state
to
say,
“the
city
of
tacoma
is
disabled
from
accepting
the
federal
power
of
--
the
grant
of
federal
eminent
domain
in
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act.”
we
think
that
the
first
hydro
case,
the
oregon
case,
as
well
as
the
--
all
the
earlier
cases
involving
railroads
which
companies
and
so
forth,
go
to
the
point
that
once
a
state
has
--
shall
i
say,
allowed
to
come
with
a
plunge
into
the
water,
it
can't
say,
“you
can't
get
your
hair
wet.”
that
--
that
we
think
is
what
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
here,
that
under
the
state
law
as
interpreted
by
the
--
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
both
of
these
opinions
has
said,
“tacoma
may
plunge
into
the
mill,
come
with
federal
power
production
as
a
licensee
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
then
it
has
said,
“but
you
can't
get
your
hair
wet,
though
you
can
engage
in
swimming
needs
and
everything
else.”
well,
we
think
that
the
federal
constitution
prohibits
that
kind
of
string
from
being
attached
to
the
--
to
an
agency,
which
is
otherwise,
a
perfectly
valid
licensee
of
congress
of
the
federal
power
commission
acting
under
a
statute
which
is
the
--
one
of
the
important
implementations
of
the
federal
commerce
power.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice,
except
to
this
extent.
if
you
will
recall,
i
did
question
the
substantiality,
in
prior,
washington
state
decisions
of
this
distinction
between
capacity
to
accept
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
act
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
leaving
aside
the
qualification,
i
--
we
would
accept
that
there
is
no
distinction.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
know.
