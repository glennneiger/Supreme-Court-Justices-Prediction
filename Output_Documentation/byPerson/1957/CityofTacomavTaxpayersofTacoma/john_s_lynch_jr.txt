mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
attempt
to
answer
that.
may
it
--
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
state
of
washington
does
not
allow
private
utilities.
at
least,
it
is
held
in
the
case
of
a
railroad
company
that
it
could
not
condemn
land
of
the
state
that
had
been
dedicated
to
a
governmental
purpose.
now,
a
land
that
is
held
in
a
proprietary
capacity,
i'm
satisfied
could
be
condemned
by
a
public
utility
just
as
it
could
be
by
the
city
of
tacoma.
and
the
case
which
counsel
referred
to
the
early
tacoma
case
of
121
washington
recognized
that
land
held
in
proprietary
capacity
could
be
lead
by
the
state,
could
be
condemned
whereas
governmental
property
in
the
case
of
washington
could
not.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i'm
satisfied
that
there
is
such
an
--
a
public
agency,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
that
is
the
--
what
is
known
as
a
public
utility
district
and
the
statute
i
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
the
statute
states
that
the
public
utility
districts
can
condemn
any
and
all
state
school
or
other
property
and
being
all
inclusive
in
general,
it
is
assumed
that
they
can
so
condemn.
now,
of
course,
the
fact
that
the
state
has
selected
one
agency
for
that
purpose
does
not
indicate
that
it
has
selected
any
other
because
the
inclusion
of
one
would
probably
mean
the
exclusion
of
all
others.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
the
public
utility
district
is
a
district
of
a
countywide
basis
which
is
authorized
to
furnish
electrical
service
or
water
service
to
the
area
of
the
county,
the
inhabitants
of
the
county.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
it's
public.
it's
a
public
agency.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
the
same
--
it's
a
municipal
corporation
just
as
a
county
or
city
or
court
district
or
any
other
agency.
and
the
state
has
authorized
those
types
of
district
to
condemn
state
property,
but
it
has
not
authorized,
in
our
opinion,
the
city
or
municipal
--
municipal
corporation
to
so
condemn.
now,
before
--
i
want
to
take
up
in
some
detail
the
question
of
the
--
whether
or
not
an
adequate
federal
question
is
properly
presented
in
this
proceeding.but
first,
i
would
like
to
answer
counsel
on
some
of
the
other
points
that
have
been
raised.
mr.
ely,
i
feel,
indicated
that
the
question
of
property
either
could
have
or
might
have
been
raised
in
the
prior
hearing
before
the
federal
power
commission
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
i've
examined
the
briefs
of
counsel
for
that
case.
i
was
not
in
the
proceedings
at
that
time,
but
the
property
or
the
word
property
that
was
the
subject
of
the
discussion
at
that
time
was
the
fish.
in
other
words,
the
fish
are
the
property
of
the
state
of
washington
and
they
claimed
that
the
--
that
property
was
being
destroyed.
now,
the
--
at
page
118
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
three
questions
that
were
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
were
set
out
by
the
court,
as
to
just
exactly
what
was
brought
before
that
court.
and
the
first
was
that
tacoma
hadn't
obtained
the
permit
from
the
state
supervisor
of
hydraulics.
and
secondly,
that
they
had
not
obtained
written
approval
from
the
state
directors
of
fishery
and
game
as
to
plans
for
the
proper
protection
of
fish.
that
was
for
the
letters
and
for
the
provision
for
taking
the
fish
over
the
dams.and
third,
that
both
of
the
proposed
dams
exceed
the
25-foot
height
of
the
columbia
river
sanctuary
act.
now,
these
were
all
police
power
acts
similar
to
the
act
that
the
--
this
court
had
felt
was
inoperative
in
the
first
iowa
case
and
the
washington
court,
and
also
the
court
of
appeals.
it
held
that
those
acts
could
not
operate
against
the
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
federal
power
act
and
that
the
federal
act
was
supreme
in
its
field.
but
the
court
of
appeals
specifically,
accepted
from
its
decision
the
question
of
capacity
of
the
city
to
operate
under
the
license,
and
in
so
many
words
said
this
question
might
be
inquired
into
by
the
commission
as
relevant
to
the
practicability
of
the
plan,
but
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
no
power
to
adjudicate
it.
now,
if
the
commission
has
no
power
to
adjudicate,
it
is
fundamental
in
law
that
a
ruling
by
such
commission
would
not
be
res
judicata.
and
the
power
acts
specifically
provides
the
exception
which
counsel
had
cited
as
the
basis
for
appeal
from
the
ruling
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
the
court
of
appeals
have
stated
that
this
matter
should
have
been
urged
before
the
federal
power
commission
and
before
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
that
i
just
read
from,
your
honor,
that's
at
page
118.well,
the
reference
of
what
was
accepted
is
at
page
121
(a),
your
honor.
yes.
it
starts
about
line
six
or
seven
of
that
page.
and
the
statute
having
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
questions
as
to
capacity
of
the
city
to
act
on
the
license
could
be
considered
by
the
commission,
but
that
the
commission
could
not
adjudicate
those.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
can't
answer,
your
honor.
i
--
i
wasn't
connected
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
with
the
matter
of
that
such.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor
that
the
state
felt
that
the
columbia
river
sanctuary
act
would
prohibit
the
commission
from
acting
on
the
matter
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
examiner
thought
the
federal
power
commission
did
recommend
against
the
issuance
of
the
license.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
it
would
have
been
wise
if
that
position
had
been
presented
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
this
way.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
think
i
probably
should
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
know
of
no
legal
barriers
that
could
have
prevented
the
presentation
the
court
got
authority.
now,
i
will
say
this
that
on
the
first
iowa
case,
that
was
a
case
involving
police
power
law
rather
than
a
substantive
law
of
the
state,
such
as
the
instant
case
and
the
type
of
licensee
in
that
case
was
--
while
it's
been
referred
to
as
a
creature
of
the
state,
it
was
a
nonprofit
cooperative
association,
whereas
in
the
instant
case,
we're
dealing
with
the
municipal
corporation
which
is
an
entirely
different
type
of
body.
a
municipal
corporation
is
simply
a
civil
department
of
the
greater
sovereign
state.
it's
a
part
of
the
whole
and
the
powers
which
it
has
fundamentally
are
the
powers
which
its
creator
has
given.
now,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
may
be
limitations
in
the
charter.
well,
the
charter
of
the
city
of
tacoma
provides
having
this
as
the
section
of
charter
having
to
do
with
public
utility
operations
provides
that
the
city
shall
possess
all
the
powers
granted
to
cities
by
state
law
and
there
is
no
further
grant
than
that
charter
provision.
and
what
the
state
of
washington
supreme
court
held
was
that
the
city
would
have
authority.
i
mean,
that
it
would
have
authority
as
far
as
police
power
acts
are
concerned
to
construct
today.
but
if
that
is
far
as
taking
property
for
a
proprietary
purpose
which
its
sovereign
held
in
a
governmental
plea
was
beyond
the
power
of
which
the
state
had
given
to
it
in
the
first
instance.
and
that
while
it
could
receive
a
license
from
the
federal
power
commission
that
it
could
not
use
that
license
to
take
the
governmental
property.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
the
facts,
of
course
would
be
--
i
mean,
the
question
would
be
somewhat
different,
mr.
chief
justice,
though
i
feel
that
as
a
matter
of
basic
law
that
property
which
is
held
by
the
state
in
a
sovereign
capacity
for
governmental
purposes
cannot
be
taken
by
any
other
agency
that
possibly
the
united
states
for
a
purpose
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
which
the
sovereign
holds.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
you
mean,
by
the
washington
supreme
court
or
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
i
can
come
to
that
point
of
the
argument,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
section
21
is
a
power
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
yes,
i
am
satisfied
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
state
would
be
objecting
as
vociferously,
whether
it
were
the
city
of
tacoma
or
the
city
of
portland
let's
us
say
or
some
private
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
utility
that
we're
taking
the
property
which
the
state
held
for
its
governmental
purpose.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
yes,
i
am
satisfied.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
except
such
a
--
a
corporation,
such
as
a
public
utility
district
which
the
state
has
by
statute
authorized
to
take
or
i
like
to
call
power
purchase
property
of
the
state.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
think
since
--
i
think
at
the
present
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
probably
is
the
only
type
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
of
an
agency
if
operating
in
our
state
that
it
could
take
the
state
property.
that
--
that
is
governmental
property
as
differentiated
from
property
held
in
proprietorship.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
now,
counsel
has
pointed
out
that
--
that
this
isn't
a
case
involving
for
some
government
building
such
as
a
state
capital
or
a
state
university
was
being
taken,
but
it's
just
a
fish
hatchery
which
may
be
replaced.
now,
thats
only
presents
a
matter
of
degree.
it
doesn't
present
a
difference
in
the
question
of
the
taking
of
the
governmental
property
of
the
state
by
some
other
person
or
body
and
we
don't
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
realize,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
there
may
be
a
distinction,
but
there
is
also
a
distinction
when
the
state
would
be
operating
something
in
a
proprietary
field.
rather,
it's
differentiated
from
a
governmental
and
in
the
state
of
washington
this
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
is
and
always
has
been
governmental.
i
mean
that
the
history
of
the
state
started
on
lumber
and
fish
and
actually
those
have
been
the
two
strong
legs
of
the
state
ever
--
ever
since
it's
--
was
an
early
territory.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
now,
as
far
as
the
question
as
to
the
mootness
of
the
--
the
possible
mootness
of
the
matter,
the
section
of
the
code
providing
for
a
license,
provides
that
the
dam
--
that
the
project
shall
be
commenced
within
two
years
of
the
date
of
the
license.
that's
construction
of
the
project
works
and
at
that
period
of
commencement
may
be
extended
once
for
not
more
than
two
years.
now,
there
are
two
dams
on
the
cowlitz
river.
i
mean,
there
are
two
dams
in
this
license.
there
is
the
mayfield
dam
at
about
mile
52
and
then
approximately
15
miles
upstream
is
the
mossyrock
dam.
the
mayfield
is
the
one
which
is
now
under
construction.
the
mossyrock
is
the
large
one
which
will
be
the
reservoir,
of
the
state
of
operation.
nothing
has
been
done
on
the
mossyrock
dam.
now,
i
don't
wish
to
argue
at
any
great
detail
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
i
mean,
as
to
why
the
city
didn't
go
into
the
project
because
i
realize
that
it
has
been
sorely
distressed
by
the
restraining
order
which
was
placed
on
it
in
june
of
1955.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
statute
itself,
which
is
the
grant
provides
that
the
project
works
shall
be
constructed
and
the
main
dam
has
not
been
started
to
this
date.
now,
i
realize
that
the
federal
power
commission
can
extend
the
period
of
construction
under
the
license,
but
it
has
no
power
to
be
on
the
statute
as
to
extension
of
the
period
of
commencement
of
construction.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
the
statute
does
not
define
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
states
that
they
shall
commence
the
construction
of
the
project
works
using
the
plural.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
indeed,
it
is.
so,
what
the
city
had
done
at
that
time
is
the
reason
that
the
city
got
into
that
problem.
they
--
they
left
the
contract
and
that
is
before
that
the
--
before
the
litigation
was
terminated
then
a
restraining
order
was
placed
upon
the
city
immediately,
which
was
later
modified
by
the
trial
court
to
allow
construction
outside
of
the
bed
of
the
river,
but
not
in
the
bed
of
the
cowlitz
river
until
the
final
determination
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
there
is
not
a
public
utility
district
in
pierce
county,
mr.
justice
black.
there
are
--
of
the
39
counties
in
the
state
of
washington,
there
are
23
of
those
counties
which
now
are
operating
public
utility
districts
in
the
electrical,
generation,
and
distribution
lists
and
two
additional
counties
have
water
operations,
but
in
neither
king
county
where
seattle
is
located,
nor
pierce
county
where
tacoma
is
located
is
there
a
public
utility
district.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
the
statute
provides
for
--
as
to
how
they
shall
be
created.
they're
created
by
the
vote
of
the
people
of
the
several
counties
and
--
and
they're
authorized
and
engaged
in
a
proprietary,
electrical,
and
water
business.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
in
my
opinion,
mr.
justice
black,
they
could
take
this
plant
under
the
strict
terms
of
the
statute.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
they
could.
they
could
take
over
the
--
and
build
the
plant
and
take
the
state
profit.
they're
specifically
authorized
to
take
all
state
profits.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
sovereign
can
specify
whether
any
of
its
properties
can
be
taken
from
it.
and
that
it
can
choose
without
--
i
mean
it
can
choose
which
of
a
public
body
shall
have
the
right
to
take
its
property
and
the
--
the
purpose
for
which
it
may
be
taken.
now,
there
is
--
while
both
cities
and
public
utility
districts
are
in
the
power
operation
field,
there
is
some
difference
in
the
manner
and
means
in
which
they
operate.
one
works
in
an
urban
area
of
--
or
partly,
the
cities.
the
other
one
works
in
the
countywide
basis
for
the
powers
furnished
for
a
uniform
rate
throughout
the
county
and
develop
of
the
type
--
rea
type
of
operation
rather
and
the
--
that
purpose
is
given
a
more
favorable
rights,
as
i
read
the
statute
to
take
over
public
property.
i
know
of
no
cases
where
--
i
couldn't
cite
you
a
case
where
a
public
utility
district
has
taken
a
state
property
dedicated
to
a
public
use
without
the
consent
of
the
state
in
the
first
instance.i
know
of
no
case
where
they
obtained
it
by
force.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
believe
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
they
could,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
there
has
been
some
discussion
that
they
might
even
consider
such
an
operation.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
the
statute
itself
has
never
been
construed,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
justice
frankfurter.
well,
it
states
--
and
these
are
the
first
few
words
of
it,
“a
district
may
take,
condemn
and
purchase,
purchase
and
acquire
any
public
and
private
property,
franchises
and
property
rights
including
state,
county,
and
school
lands.”
i
mean,
in
--
of
the
most
inclusive
terms.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
in
substance,
that
is
correct
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
--
the
state
claims
that
since
it
is
the
sovereign
and
creator
of
the
political
subdivisions,
that
the
political
subdivision,
in
other
words,
the
part
not
being
as
great
as
the
whole,
cannot
take
the
property
of
the
whole
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
without
its
consent.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
they
should
have
come
as
no
surprise
to
the
city
of
tacoma,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
in
the
case
of
--
of
tacoma
versus
state
in
1922,
the
state
resisted
taking
by
the
city
of
tacoma
of
certain
property
for
another
hydroelectric
dam
and
determined
that
the
property
--
now,
the
supreme
court
determined
that
the
major
portion
of
the
property
had
--
was
held
in
proprietary
capacity
and
allowed
the
city
to
take
it.
it
determined
that
other
property
which
had
been
dedicated
to
a
governmental
use
had
been
abandoned
from
that
use
and
allowed
it
to
be
taken.
and
then,
it
found
that
the
only
fish
hatchery
that
was
involved,
there
was
a
hatchery
also
in
that
case,
but
that
it
was
downstream
from
the
project
and
would
not
be
adversely
affected
by
the
operation.
but
the
court
in
that
case
specifically
found
in
so
many
words
that
if
it
had
been
affected
by
the
operation,
that
the
question
would
end
at
that
particular
stage
of
the
proceedings.
and
this
hatchery
being
upstream
from
the
dam
and
it
will
be
inundated
approximately
60
feet,
will
be
adversely
affected
and
tacoma
was
on
--
adequate
in
other
words,
on
its
earlier
decision
as
to
just
what
it
would
have.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
the
state
game
department
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
a
commission
which
is
appointed
by
the
governor
on
staggered
terms
and
the
appointments
are
--
are
confirmed
by
the
state
itself.
and
it
was
that
body
that
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
adopted
this
resolution
to
make
its
position
clear.
now,
the
state
had
been
operating
this
hatchery
since
at
least
1941,
and
when
tacoma
started
into
this
proceeding
it
knew
that
there
was
a
hatchery
at
this
location.
it
--
there's
been
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
might
be
possible
for
a
municipal
corporation
or,
i
mean,
a
state
rather,
to
put
in
a
hatchery
or
put
in
some
other
operation
and
defeat
the
federal
purpose,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
actually,
the
city
is
trying
as
to
the
--
it
would
appear
to
defeat
the
state
purpose
to
take
to
its
municipal
function
what
the
state
had
previously
held
to
the
state
function.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
black.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
if
the
property
became
a
federal
property
and
titles
were
held
in
the
united
states
of
america,
that
it
could
convey
to
the
city
under
state
law
of
that
property
and
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
state
could
--
i
mean
that
the
city
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i'm
satisfied,
mr.
justice
black,
that
if
--
if
the
united
states
could
gain
title
to
the
premises,
that
it
could
convey
them
to
the
city
and
that
the
city
could
function
in
this
area.
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
about
it.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
yes,
the
--
the
position
of
the
washington
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
that's
right.
i
understand,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
the
court,
a
superior
federal
purpose
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
could
acquire
property
which
the
state
held
for
a
governmental
purpose
as
well.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
or
any
other
court
who,
has
ever
gone
to
the
point,
however,
that
the
government
would
have
an
unlimited
right
to
take
for
any
purpose
any
state
property.
now,
i
think
that
congress
under
the
general
powers
could
determine
that
the
property
of
the
state
might
be
taken,
but
on
an
undeclared
or
rather
an
unspecified
purpose
set
forth
in
a
general
statute.
i
would
be
inclined
and
if
you
would
want
to
be
back
before
this
court
again
to
present
that
question
for
further
consideration.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
or
maybe
i
shouldn't
say
this.
i
--
i
understood
the
public
utility
district
did
make
an
application
subsequent
while
this
was
all
going
on
here,
but
i
mean
that
that
--
i
feel
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
no
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
no--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
would
say
this,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
that
--
that
the
city
of
tacoma
can
build
this
dam
tomorrow,
but
if
--
can
only
build
it
to
a
height
of
120
feet
under
this
decision.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
because
that
the
state
of
washington
did
have
a
state
power
commission
at
one
time,
but
that
was
abolished
by
act
of
the
legislature.
i
--
at
the
present
time,
i
know
of
only
one,
but
i
--
the
question,
as
i
see
it
as
to
the
federal
and
the
state
right
on
this
--
the
question
is
this.
that
the
city
being
simply
a
municipal
subdivision
and
a
part
of
the
state,
even
if
the
state
supreme
court
of
washington
were
incorrect
in
its
opinion
as
to
the
rights
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
grant
the
license,
still
on
its
determination
of
the
powers
and
abilities
of
its
cities
and
the
capacity
of
its
--
the
subdivisions
albeit
itself,
it
is
the
final
voice
as
to
what
its
civil
department
shall
have,
what
--
which
department
shall
operate
in
which
field
and
how
great
shall
it
--
the
power
to
be
in
that
field.
and
no
other
person
or
body
can
go
through
that
subdivision
of
the
whole
sovereign
state
and
grant
to
it
a
power
greater
than
the
sovereign
itself
has
granted
to
it.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
may
i
answer
that
before
the
recess,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
mr.
justice
black?
well,
let
me
say
this.
i
don't
think
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
open
under
the
eleventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
for
process
against
the
state
of
washington
and
take
this
project
at
least
by
the
city
of
tacoma.
they
would
be
by
the
united
states
of
america,
but
i
don't
think
the
city
could
get
in
the
federal
court
against
the
state.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
earlier
in
argument,
question
was
asked
relative
to
taking
by
the
united
states
of
america
of
a
property
of
the
state.
now,
there
is
a
property
dedicated
previously
to
a
governmental
use.
there
have
been
cases
from
this
court
where
that
type
of
property
has
been
taken.
and
the
carmack
case,
i
think
is
a
typical
example
of
that
type
of
taking.
but
in
all
of
those
cases
where
--
where
the
property
was
public
property
either
it
was
held
in
a
proprietary
capacity
or
in
such
as
the
carmack
case
actually
the
city
in
that
particular
case
was
agreeable
to
the
taking
for
post
office
purposes
but
the
land
had
been
conveyed
by
a
--
a
party
to
the
city
with
a
limitation.
many
years
before
enactment,
the
true
party
in
interest
in
that
case
was
the
heir
of
the
earlier
ancestor
they
had
conveyed.
and
the
question
was
not
posed
actually
of
the
taking
of
the
governmental
property
in
the
sense
that
the
taking
of
governmental
property
is
posed
here.
i
don't
say
that
the
government
cannot
take
the
property
for
its
higher
purposes
because
certainly
it
can.
but
a
non-expressed
purpose
in
the
statute
would
be
it
seems
to
me
a
strained
purpose
to
take
property
which
the
state
for
its
own
sovereign
purpose
is
--
has
determined
is
for
the
state's
sovereign
needs
such
as
the
state
of
washington
has
in
this
case.
now,
one
other
question
that
was
posed
was
the
question,
“could
a
private
corporation
or
private
utility
take
the
property?”
in
the
case
--
in
the
lower
court
from
which
this
action
is
taken,
the
washington
court
and
its
on
page
283
of
the
record,
the
court
discusses
in
that
--
that
was
a
case
of
a
taking
by
a
railroad
corporation
of
land
in
the
port
town
scenario
of
the
state
of
washington.
and
the
taking
by
the
railroad
corporation
was
denied
in
that
case
because
the
property
had
been
dedicated
to
the
governmental
use.
but
the
court
point
--
pointed
out
there
and
points
out
here
that
the
cases
where
the
state
of
washington
has
recognized
the
taking
of
its
property
for
utility
purpose
is
where
the
property
has
held
in
a
proprietary
capacity.
and
--
and
i'm
satisfied
that
if
a
type
of
a
private
corporation
sought
to
take
state
property
that
the
same
objection
would
be
posed
at
that
time
that
is
--
was
posed
in
this
case
which
i
refer
to
here.
to
make
clear
on
the
question
of
the
public
utility
district,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
you
asked
about
the
possibility
of
--
of
pierce
county,
the
rural
pierce
county
forming
a
public
utility
district
can
take
it.
public
utility
districts
in
the
state
of
washington
are
authorized
to
take
land
either
within
or
without
their
boarders.
i
mean
on
page
32
of
my
brief
and
i'll
just
read
the
short
sentence
there,
“and
the
district
may
erect
within
or
without
its
limits
dams
or
other
works
across
any
river
or
water
--
water
course
and
so
forth.”
so
the
--
the
taking
is
not
limited
inside
the
area
of
the
district.
i
might
state
that
this
property
is
not
located
in
pierce
county.
it
is
located
in
louise
county
which
is
some
two
--
well,
it
joins
on
the
pierce
county
on
the
southern
end.
there
is
a
public
utility
district
in
louise
county.
there
might
be
some
problem
posed
under
the
state
law
if
a
public
utility
district
from,
say
pierce
county
should
attempt
to
condemn
property
in
the
area
in
which
another
public
utility
district
were
currently
operating
and
also
seeking
the
same
property.
that
question
has
never
been
determined
and
i
would
hesitate
to
advise
the
court
what
the
final
result
would
be.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
the
purpose
of
the
objection,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
i
understand
that
--
is
not
in
the
record.
there
was
an
objection
of
the
state
game
and
fish
departments
that
the
hatchery
being
a
successful
operation,
i
mean
being
the
most
successful
of
all
the
hatchery
operations
in
the
state
because
of
the
fact
that
the
plant
from
that
hatchery
brought
a
greater
return
from
the
fish
than
any
other
hatcheries
that
they
didn't
wish
to
have
it
taken
for
any
purpose.
now,
there
was
an
offer
of
relocation
but
the
state
countered
the
--
their
question
was
why
if
instead
of
relocating
our
hatchery,
why
don't
you
lower
your
dam?
i
mean
and
that
was
the
counter
proposition.
so
i
mean
it
left
at
somewhat
of
an
impasse
on
that
point.
now,
one
other
thing
i
--
one
other
statement
i
think
should
be
called
at
the
court's
attention
and
it
shows
at
page
177
of
the
record
and
that
is
that
it
involves
--
it
involves
a
construction
of
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act.
now,
that
was
an
action
which
was
instituted
by
the
city
of
tacoma
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington,
the
southern
division
with
officers
in
tacoma
before
the
honorable
judge
boldt.
a
--
a
challenge
was
taken
to
the
action
of
the
city
to
institute
the
action
in
that
court
and
judge
boldt
in
an
opinion
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
counsel
advised
them
and
this
is
the
copy
of
it
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
challenge
the
city's
authority
to
act
under
section
21
in
that
court
was
well
taken.
and
he
held
as
he
holds
here
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
authority
to
remove
limitations
on
the
powers
of
washington
city
is
expressly
provided
by
the
legislature
and
accordingly
section
21
which
grants
the
right
of
eminent
domain
and
the
district
courts
does
not
remove
the
limitation
on
condemnation
powers
of
washington
city's.
as
a
result
of
that
and
he
provides,
as
you
will
note
that,
an
order
in
conformity
that
therewith
may
be
presented.
now,
what
happened
was
that
at
conclusion
--
i
mean
as
soon
as
the
counsel
before
the
city
obtained
--
were
advised
of
the
opinion
of
judge
boldt,
a
voluntary
nonsuit
was
taken.
i
mean
the
action
never
was
prosecuted
to
final
judgment
in
the
proceeding
but
there
had
--
there
was
this
determination
by
the
district
court
in
the
form
of
this
correspondence
stating
the
position
of
the
district
court
specifically
on
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
which
is
actually
the
statute
which
is
before
the
court
today.
and
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
myself
to
a
discussion
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
is
actually
a
grant
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
as
counsel
for
the
government
and
for
the
city
contend
or
whether
it
is
rather
a
statute
providing
for
venue
in
jurisdiction.
now,
certainly,
the
statute
by
its
latter
provisions
is
a
statute
having
to
do
with
jurisdiction
because
after
the
proviso
clause,
it
provides
that
jurisdiction
may
be
had
in
the
federal
court
if
the
amount
in
controversy
exceeds
$3000
and
so
that
portion
of
the
statute
certainly
is
one
of
jurisdiction.
the
question
then
presents
itself,
does
the
provision
of
the
section
which
states
that
the
licensee
may
acquire
the
same,
referring
to
the
property
to
be
sought,
by
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
eminent
domain
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
in
which
such
land
or
other
property
may
be
located.
the
question
is,
is
that
a
grant
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
or
is
it
a
grant
of
the
right
of
venue
in
the
district
court
of
the
land
in
which
the
property
may
be
located?
now,
the
district
court
of
missouri
in
the
union
electric
or
the
state
of
missouri
ex
rel.
camden
county
vs.
union
electric
held
that
it
was
a
grant
of
the
federal
power.
and
that
the
licensee
did
have
the
power
to
exercise
eminent
domain
under
this
proceeding.
but
the
--
i
hope
this
is
right
your
honor.
this
court
has
never
construed
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act.
it
has
mentioned
that
in
passing
on
at
least
three
or
four
occasions
but
it
has
never
construed
the
act
and
the
act
generally
has
been
brought
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
from
nebraska
where
nebraska
public
power
district
which
are
somewhat
similar
to
the
public
utility
districts
of
the
state
of
washington
have
gone
into
the
federal
courts
and
condemned
the
land
in
the
state
of
nebraska
with
no
diversity
of
citizenship
being
involved.
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
grant
that
this
statute
gives
to
the
city
of
tacoma,
it
would
not
be
possible
for
the
city
of
tacoma
to
go
into
the
federal
court
and
condemn
the
land
in
louise
county
which
is
in
the
same
state
with
washington
and
actually,
it's
in
the
same
judicial
district,
the
southern
--
the
western
district
southern
division.
now,
the
united
states
of
america
could
proceed
in
the
federal
court
against
the
property
but
eminent
domain
being
in
and
around
proceeding
is
normally
bought
in
the
county
in
which
the
land
is
situated.
the
purposes
for
that
being
that
that
is
where
the
record
of
the
property
is
kept
and
the
proceeding
is
not
against
the
owner
of
the
land
but
against
the
particular
track
of
land
and
who
gets
the
money
that
is
paid
in
compensation
is
to
be
determined
by
whoever
has
a
right
to
the
property
as
to
the
records.
now,
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
federal
power
commission
would
not
grant
a
license
to
build
a
project
to
anyone
that
didn't
have
powers
of
eminent
domain
in
the
first
instance.
it
speaks
of
the
persons
and
--
or
the
different
groups
that
might
bring
the
action,
mention
states
while
eminent
domain
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
sovereignty.
certainly,
the
state
would
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain
and
municipal
corporations
for
municipal
purposes.
as
far
as
i
know,
will
have
the
right
of
eminent
domain
granted
to
it
by
the
sovereign
state
which
created
it
or
authorized
it.
and
private
utility
companies
which
would
seek
to
obtain
a
license
from
the
federal
power
commission
as
one
of
their
powers
would
have
the
right
of
eminent
domain.
but
the
one
thing
that
they
would
not
have
would
be
to
--
the
right
to
go
into
the
united
states
district
court
to
acquire
the
property.
they
would
normally
be
held
to
go
into
the
court
--
the
county
court
of
the
county
or
the
state
court
of
the
county
in
which
the
land
is
located.
and
the
provisions
of
this
statute
granting
that
right
are
something
over
and
additional
to
the
right
that
the
normal
licensee
would
have.
and
it
seems
to
me
from
the
phraseology
of
the
section
that
what
it
actually
has
given
is
the
right
to
use
the
federal
courts
for
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
and
that
is
a
venue,
not
a
grant
of
power
section.
it's
a
grant
of
the
right
to
use
the
venue.
the
history
of
the
federal
power
act
as
i
read
it
in
the
congressional
record
is
the
various
parts
with
any
references
to
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act.
the
major
portion
of
the
discussion
in
the
record
had
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
would
be
the
--
the
$3,000
limitation
for
the
right
to
use
the
federal
courts
and
that
was
placed
in.
but
the
history
of
the
federal
power
act
indicates
that
it
was
not
brought
as
a
--
actually,
it
wasn't
brought
as
a
limitation
on
the
states.
several
places
in
the
record,
there
is
discussion
by
members
of
the
committee,
the
house
particularly
mr.
la
follette
who
is
the
member
of
congress
from
washington,
that
the
purpose
of
the
federal
power
act
was
not
to
infringe
on
the
rights
of
the
states.
but
what
was
--
the
situation
was
then
at
the
time
that
this
act
was
passed
was
that
under
the
statutes
of
1899
--
i
have
and
got
them
in
the
brief,
its
three
statutes
1121,
33
u.s.
code
section
401.
there
was
a
provision
that
no
dam
or
structure
could
be
built
and
crossing
navigable
stream
without
the
consent
of
congress.
that
was
a
limitation
on
the
bill.
and
as
a
result,
there
hadn't
been
--
i
mean,
anytime
anyone
wanted
to
build
a
dam,
he
would
have
to
come
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
obtain
permission
to
put
a
structure
across
the
stream.
if
he
did
not
do
so,
there
was
always
the
risk
that
the
capital
that
was
invested
in
the
operation
would
be
lost.
and
there
was
considerable
confusion
between
the
two
houses
of
congress.
in
one
house,
it
was
felt
that
there
should
be
some
contribution
paid
by
the
licensee
for
the
use
of
the
property
and
by
the
other
that
there'd
be
no
contribution.
and
as
a
result,
no
dams
were
constructed.
there
were
only
i
think
the
record
show
that
there
were
two
dams
constructed
over
a
period
of
approximately
10
years.
and
the
act
by
giving
authority
to
a
commission
to
license
and
release
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
the
power
to
build
dams
did
encourage
construction
of
dams.
the
limitation
was
not
one
at
the
time
of
the
act
that
had
been
placed
there
by
the
states
but
the
question
of
the
limitation
on
navigation
of
the
federal
power
and
to
construe
this
act.
as
counsel
for
petitioner
have
requested
this
court
to
construe
it
would
be
a
very
severe
limitation
on
the
right
of
states
which
is
not
apparent
in
the
act
itself
and
would
imply
to
congress
that
intent
which
normally
would
--
would
seem
to
me
should
be
spelled
out
with
great
certainty
before
the
united
states
of
america
as
a
sovereign,
as
the
supreme
sovereign
gets
into
a
discussion
with
the
sovereign
states
as
to
the
use
of
their
governmental
property.
for
a
while,
the
united
states
of
america
when
it
takes
the
property,
it
takes
it
in
its
governmental
sphere,
the
licensees
of
the
federal
power
commission
take
either
our
states
or
municipalities
taken
a
proprietary
sphere.
and
when
a
--
a
private
utility
takes
--
it
takes,
of
course,
on
a
private
sphere
and
to
infer
that
congress
intended
to
take
for
that
purpose,
governmental
property
seems
to
me
to
be
beyond
the
plain
implication
of
the
act.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
black
that
i
don't
think
that
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
grants
the
federal
power
of
eminent
domain.
i
don't
think
that
a
licensee
of
the
act
has
the
same
power
of
eminent
domain
that
the
united
states
of
america
has.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
he
has
the
right
--
pardon?
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
he
has
the
right,
mr.
justice
black,
to
exercise
his
power
of
eminent
domain
in
the
united
states'
courts
rather
than
being
limited
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
it
refers
to
any
licensee,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
it
would
be
my
intention,
mr.
justice
black,
that
in
the
state
of
washington
it
could
not
take
property
that
had
been
dedicated
to
governmental
use.
it
could
take
state
proprietary
property,
yes.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
black,
that
i
don't
think
that
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington
that
a
private
corporation
whether
created
by
the
state
of
washington
or
--
i
mean
--
and
i
refer
you
to
the
railroad
case
which
i
just
cited
would
have
the
authority
to
take
property
which
the
state
had
previously
devoted
and
was
using
in
the
governmental
status.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
think
that
a
private
corporation
would
have
the
power.
but
i
think
that
a
municipal
corporation
would
have
even
less
authority
to
take
part
of
its
sovereign's
property
because
a
private
corporation
would
--
has
in
many
degrees
the
status
of
decision
and
there
are
certain
rights
that
a
private
corporation
would
have
that
a
municipal
corporation
does
not
have.
a
municipal
corporation
is
simply
a
part
of
the
whole.
it's
as
much
a
part
of
the
state
of
washington
as
my
thumb
is
a
part
of
my
hand.
it's
--
you
can't
--
you
cannot
segregate
the
one
from
the
other.
now,
well,
you
can
you
segregate
the
tacoma
from
the
state
and
you
still
have
the
state
of
washington.
but
it's
the
existence
of
tacoma
as
a
municipal
corporation
depends
on
the
powers
which
the
state
of
washington
has
granted
to
it
and
like
cities
of
its
class.
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
--
mr.
--
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
it
passed
an
act
under
its
police
powers
that
that
act
would
be
strictly
under
the
prohibition
of
the
first
iowa
case
and
that
it
would
not
be
operated.
but
--
mr.
john
s.
lynch,
jr.
well,
of
course
that
--
you're
asking
me
the
question
mr.
chief
justice
on
something
that
i
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
with
absolute
certainty
because
it
hasn't
come
before
the
--
either
to
this
court
or
the
washington
court.
my
opinion
would
be
that
the
washington
court
would,
if
it
followed
the
same
pattern
that
it
has
previously
would
not
recognize
the
taking
of
it's
governmentally
dedicated
property
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
authorizing
it.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
that
for
federal
purposes,
the
carmack
case
typical
of
them,
the
property
which
has
been
dedicated
to
a
public
use
may
be
taken.
i
mean
carmack
case
doesn't
bring
the
--
it
doesn't
bring
the
same
question
of
that
this
case
does
because
in
that
case
the
municipality
was
agreeable
to
the
taking.
but
for
the
federal
purpose
if
this
action
were
--
if
this
were
a
proceeding
by
the
united
states
of
america
taking
for
its
own
purpose
which
would
be
governmental,
then
as
i
see
it,
there
would
be
a
different
question
then
for
its
licensee
to
be
taking
for
our
purpose
that
is
proprietary.
and
there
is
a
difference
for
the
--
the
higher
use
and
necessity
of
the
one
over
the
other
because
tacoma
must
exist
first
for
its
governmental
purpose
which
is
to
handle
on
a
local
level,
governmental
powers
of
police
and
protection
and
--
and
several
government
in
--
for
protection
of
the
people.
after
it
has
--
i
mean
after
it
exists
for
that
purpose,
it
has
the
right
to
engage
in
certain
proprietary
functions
such
as
light,
the
water
or
railways
or
--
or
rather
cemeteries.
i
mean
it
can
engage
in
any
number
of
fields.
thank
you.
