mr.
northcutt
ely
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
at
the
instance
of
the
state
of
washington,
they're
enjoying
the
financing
and
construction
by
the
city
of
tacoma
of
a
power
project
which
had
been
licensed
to
1952
by
the
federal
power
commission
for
a
construction
upon
the
cowlitz
river
in
that
state,
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
the
tributary
of
the
columbia.
the
court
did
so
upon
the
sole
ground
that
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
which
provides
that
licensees
may
exercise
the
right
of
eminent
domain,
did
not
and
could
not
authorize
tacoma
to
condemn
a
state-owned
fish
hatchery
which
is
located
within
the
reservoir
area
and
which
the
project
would
inundate
in
the
absence
of
state
legislation
authorizing
a
municipality
to
condemn
state-owned
lands
devoted
to
a
public
use.
mr.
northcutt
ely
fifty
years,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
we
are
here
on
certiorari
to
that
judgment.
this,
however,
is
not
a
condemnation
action,
but
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
which
tacoma
initiated
to
validate
a
bond
issue
for
a
construction
of
the
licensed
project
after
the
license
was
issued.
the
state
intervened
or
was
added
as
a
defendant
upon
motion
of
the
state
department
of
game
and
fishery
alleging
the
violation
of
its
laws
and
the
taking
of
its
property.
this
was
after
the
state
had
unsuccessfully
appealed
from
the
power
commission's
order
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
after
that
court
had
sustained
the
order
in
a
proceeding
under
section
313
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
that
case.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
on
august
6,
1948,
10
years
ago,
tacoma
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission
the
required
declaration
of
intention
under
section
23
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act,
and
the
commission
found
that
the
cowlitz
river
was
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
that
the
project
would
affect
this
navigable
capacity
and
the
interest
of
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
it
required
a
license.
it
entered
an
order
accordingly
in
march
of
1949
and
in
that
order,
described
the
cowlitz
river
that
appears
in
your
record
as
a
stream
with
the
flow
of
approximately
10,000
cubic
feet
per
second
that
is
junctioned
with
the
columbia.
the
cowlitz
is
consequently
an
important
stream.
that
flow
is
about
seven-eighths
of
the
flow
of
the
potomac
at
washington
and
is
about
equal
to
the
flow
of
the
mississippi
at
st.
paul.
tacoma
thereupon
--
thereupon
filed
its
application
for
a
license.
the
project
as
described
by
the
commission
in
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
hearings
before
the
commission
would
consist
of
two
dams;
mayfield
dam
which
is
52
miles
upstream
from
the
junction
with
the
columbia,
which
would
rise
240
feet
above
bedrock
and
the
mossyrock
dam,
13
1/2
miles
further
upstream
which
would
rise
510
feet.
the
project
would
cost
$146
million
and
would
generate
ultimately
460,000
kilowatts.
it
would
be
interconnected
through
the
bonneville
system
with
the
entire
pacific
northwest.
by
a
comparison,
this
project
is
slightly
less
than
the
installed
capacity
of
the
bonneville
dam
which
is
just
over
500,000
kilowatts.
the
commission
ordered
this
license
issued
after
hearing
objections
by
the
state
of
washington.
the
objections
were
of
two
kinds.
first,
that
the
project
would
violate
the
state's
laws.
it
pleaded
six
of
them,
including
specifically
a
statute
which
declared
the
cowlitz
river
to
be
a
fish
sanctuary
for
the
protection
of
anadromous
fish,
that
is,
those
which
spawned
in
the
fresh
water,
go
to
the
sea,
and
return
to
spawn
again,
which
would
hatch
them,
i
should
say
in
fresh
water,
and
that
that
statute
prohibited
the
construction
of
any
dam
higher
than
25
feet.
a
second
group
of
objections
was
that
the
downstream
dam,
mayfield,
would
inundate
state-owned
lands
including
a
game-fish
hatchery.
the
state
alleged
and
its
evidence
show
that
the
mayfield
dam
were
it
to
create
a
reservoir
which
would
extend
about
400
feet
beyond
this
hatchery
and
would
inundate
it.
that
is
beyond
the
hatchery
buildings.
tacoma
in
these
proceedings,
offered
to
replace
the
hatchery.
the
state
declined
to
accept
the
replacement.
the
state's
allegation
before
the
commission
appears
at
page
292
of
your
record
and
is
preserved
there
by
the
dissenting
opinion
below.
the
state
alleged
before
the
power
commission,
quote
“that
the
reservoirs
which
would
be
created
by
the
proposed
dams
would
inundate
a
valuable
and
irreplaceable
fish
hatchery
owned
by
the
state
of
washington,
as
well
as
much
productive
spawning
areas.”
it
is
this
same
hatchery
which
brings
us
here
today.
tacoma
offered,
as
i
say,
to
replace
that
hatchery.
the
commission
refused.
the
commission
in
its
order
issuing
a
license,
found
in
the
language
of
section
4
(e)
of
the
federal
power
act,
that
this
project
would
affect
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
the
interest
of
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
reiterating
the
finding
it
had
made
on
the
initial
tender
under
23
(b)
and
that
in
the
terms
of
section
10
(a)
of
the
act,
the
project
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
for
improving
or
developing
the
waterway
involved
for
the
use
or
benefit
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
for
the
improvement
and
utilization
of
water
power
development,
for
the
conservation
and
preservation
of
fish
and
wildlife
resources,
and
for
other
beneficial
public
uses
including
recreational
purposes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
it
would
inundate
--
oh,
pardon
me,
that
the
city
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
(voice
overlap)
we
think
that
it
was
urged,
but
not
very
clearly
spelled
out.
and
i
shall
reach
that
in
a
moment
when
i
refer
to
the
proceedings
before
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i'm
coming
to
the
finding
under
section
9
(b)
of
the
act.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
--
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
are
not
as
explicit
as
they
were
later.
this
idea
have
seemed
to
have
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
generated
bit
by
bit.
the
commission
found
--
they
called
this
an
exceptionally
valuable
addition
to
the
northwest
region
power
supply
because
of
its
size,
location
and
the
characteristic
of
its
output
and
its
size
i've
indicated.
it
is
located
60
miles
from
tacoma,
between
seattle
and
portland
and
as
its
characteristics
it
happens
that
the
cowlitz
flows
high
when
the
columbia
is
low.
so
that
the
annual
peak
demand
of
this
entire
region
comes
to
the
time
when
the
cowlitz
flows
at
its
height
and
the
columbia
is
at
its
lowest.
the
commission
also
found
pursuant
to
section
9
(b)
of
the
act
that
the
applicant
had
submitted
satisfactory
evidence
of
compliance
where
the
requirements
of
all
applicable
state
laws
insofar
as
necessary
to
affect
the
--
the
purposes
of
a
license
for
the
project.
it
found
that
tacoma
was
a
municipality
within
the
meaning
of
section
3
of
the
act
and
in
fact
tacoma
has
been
engaged
in
the
business
of
generating
and
distributing
power
since
1893.it
is
one
of
the
pioneer
public
power
municipalities
of
the
united
states.
the
commission
found
that
the
project
would
create
the
important
navigation
and
flood
control
benefits
and
this
order
incorporated
criteria
for
the
operation
of
these
reservoirs
in
the
interest
of
navigation
and
flood
control
which
the
secretary
of
the
board
had
recommended
and
which
it's
unchallenged,
would
result
in
the
inundation
of
this
hatchery.
confronted
by
the
conflict
between
power
and
fishery
resources,
the
commission
ordered
tacoma
to
install
devices
which
would
lift
these
anadromous
fish
up
over
the
dams
and
would
get
the
young
fingerlings
back
down
without
being
damaged
by
the
turbines.
a
complicated
set
of
devices,
which
together
with
the
hatcheries,
which
the
commission
ordered
tacoma
to
install,
hatcheries
would
cost
all
together
$9,465,000
at
the
city's
expense.
these
hatcheries
were
a
part
of
this
large
program,
were
to
be
designed
and
installed
with
the
cooperation
of
the
state
and
--and
with
the
--
the
secretary
of
interior.
the
commission's
opinion
concludes
with
the
following
statement
which
you
will
find
at
--
on
page
26
of
your
record.
“we
are
required
to
consider
all
of
the
proposed
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
city's
proposal
from
the
standpoint
of
the
greatest
public
benefit
through
the
use
of
this
valuable
water
and
other
natural
resources.
the
question
posed
does
not
appear
to
us
between
all
power
and
no
fish,
but
rather
between
large
power
benefits
needed
particularly
for
defense
purposes,
important
flood
control
benefits,
and
navigation
benefits
with
incidental
recreation
and
intangible
benefits
balanced
against
some
fish
losses,
or
a
retention
of
the
stream
in
its
present
natural
condition
until
such
time
in
the
fairly
near
future
when
economic
pressures
will
force
its
full
utilization.”
the
state,
thereupon,
petitioned
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
this
order
on
the
ground
that
the
construction
of
the
project
would
violate
the
laws
of
washington
and
would
take
state-owned
property
which
it
said
tacoma
had
not
condemned
and
could
not
condemn
under
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act.
that
court,
in
1953,
declined
to
interfere
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
now,
the
section
313
(b)
provides
that
the
finding
of
the
commission
as
to
the
facts
shall
be
conclusive
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
shall
be
final
subject
to
review
by
this
court
on
certiorari
or
certification.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
your
honor.
it's
so
--
so
stated
in
the
opinion
below,
it
so
held.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
was
a
party.
the
--
the
proceedings
were
in
the
name
of
the
state
department
of
game,
the
state
department
of
fisheries.
it
was
represented
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state.
the
caption
of
the
state
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
state
of
washington,
department
of
game,
et
al.
and
the
court
below
specifically
refers
to
that
as
participation
by
the
state
of
washington.
but
the
question
becomes
blurred
a
little
bit
because,
as
i
shall
indicate
later,
in
one
proceeding
below
where
the
supreme
court
of
washington
ruled
on
a
demurrer
in
tacoma's
favor,
the
court
in
its
subsequent
opinion
from
which
we
are
here
on
certiorari
referred
back
to
that
one
as
not
involving
the
state.
so
that
the
--
nevertheless,
the
state
in
this
opinion
below
did
refer
to
the
ninth
circuit
proceedings
as
involving
the
state.
meantime,
in
february
1952,
soon
after
the
issuance
of
the
license
and
as
it
happened
just
before
the
state
had
taken
this
petition
to
the
ninth
circuit,
tacoma
commends
the
present
action,
a
state
court
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
to
validate
a
bond
issue
for
a
construction
of
the
project.
the
defendant's
named
were
representative
taxpayers
as
required
by
the
statute
and
the
state
directors
of
fisheries
and
game.
the
complaint
prayed
a
determination
of
all
issues
affecting
the
validity
of
the
bonds
and
tacoma's
right
to
construct
the
project.
the
taxpayers
demurred.
the
trial
court
sustained
the
demurrer
to
come
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court.
and
the
--
the
issue
this
--
considered
by
the
state
supreme
court
on
the
demurrer
was
whether
tacoma
as
a
creature
of
the
state
could
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
of
the
fish
sanctuary
act.
and
the
opinion
on
demurrer
in
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
having
--
have
been
granted
a
license
by
the
power
commission,
we
hold
that
appellant
is
at
the
present
time
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
licensee.
in
the
meantime,
i
should
have
said
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
relying
upon
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
first
iowa
case,
had
held
that
the
state
via
the
statutes
involved
could
not
veto
the
construction
of
this
project
and
that
here,
as
in
the
first
iowa
case,
the
licensee
was
a
creature
of
the
state.
mr.
northcutt
ely
state
laws,
six
of
them
were
in
controversy
as
imposing
a
veto
upon
this
project.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
not
in
those
terms,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
what
was
being
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
what
was
being
litigated
specifically
was
a
validity
of
statutory
prohibitions
as
i
will
indicate
in
a
minute.
the
opinion
below
says
that
this
is
not
a
case
at
this
stage
of
statutory
prohibitions,
but
a
lack
of
statutory
capacity
or
power
of
the
city
of
tacoma
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
accept
that
and
execute
the
federal
power.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
give
you
a
categorical
answer.
i
cannot.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
state's
brief
calls
attention
to
section
21
that
it
complains
that
its
property
is
being
taken.
it
does
not
identify
the
property,
although
it
did
before
the
commission
as
being
this
hatchery.
it
spells
out
beds
and
banks
and
streams.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
may
well
be.
but
you
did
say
that
under
section
21,
tacoma
had
not
and
could
not
proceed
to
condemn
the
property,
whatever
the
property
was.
mr.
northcutt
ely
section
21
is
the
statute
--
the
section
involved
here
which
confers
upon
licensees
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
of
the
federal
power
act.
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
by
decision,
your
honor.
there
is
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
there
is
no
statute.
i
wish
to
emphasize
it
sir.
there's
no
statute
which
prohibits
tacoma
from
receiving
and
exercising
a
federal
license
with
all
the
powers
conferred
therein.
there
is
silence.
it
is
that
silence
that
the
lower
court
finds,
disables
this.
mr.
northcutt
ely
not
explicitly.
no,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
say
further
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
say
that
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
say
there
was
at
the
very
purpose
of
section
313
(b)
with
its
--
the
language
has
the
final
and
conclusive
results
is
to
require
that
an
issue
of
this
magnitude
which
at
the
threshold,
would
disable
completely
a
project
if
the
state
of
washington
is
right
is
of
the
kind
that
ought
to
be
brought
before
the
commission
and
ought
to
be
brought
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
northcutt
ely
precisely,
that
it
comes
four
or
five
years
too
late
with
this
--
with
an
issue
of
this
magnitude
that
we
say
it
did
present
to
the
commission
and
to
the
--
and
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
state
says
it
didn't.
but
if
it
didn't,
it
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
and
if
this
the
very
type
of
thing,
that
res
judicata
should
apply
to
it.
now,
the
--
after
the
--
after
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington'
on
demurrer,
which
is
on
our
favor,
tacoma,
after
a
period
of
time
started
construction.
the
state
on
motion
of
the
directors
of
game
and
fisheries
was
thereupon
added
as
an
additional
defendant
and
it
filed
a
cross-complaint
asking
an
injunction.
it
asked
an
injunction
on
the
grounds
that
the
project
would
interfere
with
public
navigation,
that
it
conflicted
with
the
same
fish
sanctuary
act
and
other
statutes,
and
that
it
would
take
state
property
which
it
said
tacoma
could
not
condemn
specifically
this
same
hatchery
which
it
had
said
in
the
power
commission
proceedings
would
be
inundated.
it
annexed
to
the
cross-complaint
a
resolution
of
the
state
game
commission,
which
was
dated
eight
days
after
this
petition
for
intervention
was
filed,
but
before
the
cross-complaint
was
filed.
and
that
resolution
says
ipse
dixit
that
the
hatchery
is
irreplaceable.they
refused
to
sell
and
directed
that
efforts
be
made
to
resist
condemnation.
thereafter,
trial
was
held
on
the
merits.
the
superior
court
restricted
the
testimony
practically
to
the
issue
of
interference
of
the
navigation
and
yet
enjoying
the
project,
held
it
unlawful
on
the
sole
ground
that
it
would
interfere
with
public
navigations
in
defiance
of
a
law
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
on
tacoma's
appeal,
affirmed,
but
upon
the
sole
ground
that
the
project
would
take
this
state-owned
property
devoted
to
a
public
use
in
which
they
said
and
specifically,
the
power
act
did
not
and
could
not
authorize
tacoma
to
condemn.
now,
at
page
286
of
your
record,
appears
the
--
the
gravamen
of
the
holding.
the
court
below
said,
“in
the
instant
case,
the
subject
matter,
the
inherit
inability
of
the
city
to
condemn
state
lands
dedicated
to
public
use
does
not
present
a
question
of
state
statutory
prohibition.
it
presents
a
question
of
lack
of
state
statutory
power
in
the
city.
it
does
not
present
a
federal
question.
it
presents
the
question
peculiarly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
washington.”
continuing
with
the
quotation,
“the
federal
government
may
not
confer
corporate
capacity
upon
local
units
of
government
beyond
the
capacity
given
them
by
their
creators
and
the
federal
power
act
as
we
read
it
does
not
purport
to
do
so.”
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion,
three
judges
dissented.
the
dissenting
opinion
sharpens
this
issue,
if
you'll
turn
to
page
204
of
the
record
to
the
where
the
statement,
“when
the
power
commission
has
made
the
finding
as
required
by
section
9
(b)
that
the
licensee
has
complied
with
state
laws
with
respect
to
the
right
to
engage
in
the
business
of
developing,
transmitting,
and
distributing
electric
power
and
any
other
business
necessary
to
effect
the
purposes
of
the
licensee
under
the
act,
then
the
licensee
becomes
the
agent
of
the
federal
government
in
regard
to
the
project.
upon
the
issuance
of
the
license,
all
rights
and
obligations
of
the
licensee
are
derived
from
congressional
statutory
powers
and
not
those
of
the
state
where
the
project
is
located.
see
the
first
iowa
case.”
and
on
page
310
of
your
record,
the
dissent
says,
“the
federal
power
act
in
section
21
affords
a
licensee
ample
authority
as
an
agent
of
the
federal
government
to
exercise
the
power
of
eminent
domain
without
state
authority.”
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
first
iowa
case
involved
a
--
a
statute
which
would
have
directed
or
required
the
licensee
to
obtain
a
permit
from
the
executive
council
of
iowa.
a
--
a
statute
did
authorize
the
issuance
of
such
permits
if
the
water
was
to
be
returned
to
the
same
stream
from
which
diverted.
this
project
is
going
to
take
water
to
another
watershed
in
the
first
iowa
case.
the
--
it
was
known
that
the
state
--
the
council
of
iowa
would
and
i
think
did
refuse
the
permit.
there
was
to
that
extent
prohibition.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
--
you're
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
you
--
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
significance
of
the
first
iowa
case
is
the
fact,
as
here,
involved
a
creature
of
the
state.if
the
state
statute
directs
the
creature
and
what
you're
asked
to
do
is
illegal,
unlawful,
that
surely
is
as
much
or
more
of
a
disability
than
is
silence
if
they
did
confer
upon
the
creature
the
power
to
accept
and
execute
the
federal
license.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
there's
no
prohibition
at
all.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
l
--
i
--
don't
know
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
whether
i'd
go
that
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
far,
your
honor,
but
at
least
we
are
--
we
must
accept
as
being
a
state
law
below,
as
found
by
the
court,
that
in
the
absence
of
specific
authorization
to
tacoma,
that
city
does
not
under
state
law
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
have
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
oh
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
no,
you
had
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
the
case
of
--
of
prohibition.
when
we
say
prohibition
disables
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
the
power
disables
the
capacity
to
receive
the
power
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
--
i
think
in
--
in
justice
to
the
opinion,
your
honor,
you
had
a
state
statute
which
the
counsel
practically
had
to
follow
which
would
just
compel
that
(inaudible)
mr.
northcutt
ely
now,
the
--
the
dissenting
opinion
continued.
the
state
may
not
deny
or
impair
this
authority
once
the
license
was
issued.
tacoma
applied
for
a
rehearing
and
for
clarification
of
that
opinion
and
the
supreme
court
at
pages
369
to
371
of
your
record
wrote
and
filed
a
supplemental
opinion
that
it
called
“an
addition
to
the
opinion”.
and
in
that,
it
found
that
all
six
of
the
state
statutes
which
the
state
had
pleaded
as
bars
to
this
project
were
inapplicable
to
the
project
insofar
as
the
same
conflict
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act
or
the
tacoma's
license
or
opposed
the
additional
opinion
or
insofar
as
they
would
enable
state
officials
to
exercise
the
veto
over
the
said
project.
these
statutes
prohibited
the
obstruction
of
public
navigation,
required
a
permit
for
the
appropriation
of
water,
required
a
permit
to
build
a
dam,
established
a
fish
sanctuary,
prohibited
dams
higher
than
25
feet.
they
required
a
permit
to
divert
water,
and
they
required
approval
of
building
plans
for
the
protection
of
fish.
now,
i
desire
to
emphasize
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
we
are
not
here
to
ask
you
to
invalidate
any
state
statute.
the
court
below
did
that.
they
struck
down
all
six
of
them
on
the
ground
that
to
exercise
a
mandate
would
veto
this
project
which
had
been
licensed
by
the
power
commission
and
now
on
the
authority
of
the
first
iowa
case,
the
statutes
could
not
be
given
that
effect.
the
question
here
is
whether
a
federal
statute
which
is
not
in
conflict
with
any
state
statute
is
inoperative
because
it
is
not
supplemented
by
a
state
statute
giving
to
the
city
of
tacoma
the
authority
to
receive
and
execute
the
federal
power.
now,
the
issues
as
developed
below
and
as
--
and
by
the
briefs
here,
fall
into
three
groups.
the
first,
whether
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
sustained
the
commission's
order
against
the
state's
general
contention
that
the
project
would
stake
state-owned
property
as
res
judicata
as
against
the
state's
contention
in
the
present
case
that
the
project
would
take
the
specific
property.
and
second,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
whether
section
21
of
the
federal
power
act
was
intended
to
vest
in
licensees
who
are
authorized
by
the
commission
to
develop
a
waterway,
a
federal
power
of
eminent
domain
or
whether
it
was
intended
simply
to
acquiesce
in
the
exercise
by
the
licensees
of
condemnation
powers
derived
from
state
authority.
and
if
a
federal
power
was
delegated,
whether
it
includes
or
excludes
property
of
a
state
which
is
devoted
to
a
competing
use
of
the
same
waterway.
and
third,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
power,
whether
congress
can
lawfully
delegate
to
a
licensee
the
power
to
condemn
state-owned
lands
which
is
dedicated
to
a
competing
use
of
a
waterway.
and
if
so,
whether
it
may
make
such
a
delegation
to
a
licensee
to
which
the
state
has
not
granted
that
same
authority
specifically
in
municipalities.
now,
as
to
the
res
judicata
part,
your
honors,
that
is
briefed
at
pages
66
to
78
of
our
brief.
the
matter
we
think
would
be
disposed
of
by
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit,
but
for
a
reservation
in
this
opinion
which
refers
to
points
it's
not
passing
upon.we
say
that
our
point
is
included
within
the
scope
of
the
judgment
below.
the
state
says
it
is
not.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
--
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
did
exclude
the
question
here
from
its
determination
relates
to
the
constitutional
problem
and
consequently,
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
the
res
judicata
matter,
except
in
connection
with
the
constitutional
issue
to
which
i
should
comment.
on
the
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
we
say
section
21
thus
clearly
intend
to
vest
in
licensees
a
federal
power
of
eminent
domain.it
is
not
acquiescence
in
powers
to
be
derived
from
the
state.
the
four
cases
in
this
court,
i've
have
mentioned
this
section
of
the
power
act,
none
of
them
have
directly
construed
or
passed
upon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
if
we
had
a
--
a
state
statute
dissolving
the
city
of
tacoma
and
merging
it
with
a
county
we
don't,
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
challenge
the
effectiveness
of
such
a
statute.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
in
such
event,
i
--
i
don't
know.
the
united
states
would
have
outstanding
a
license
to
a
project,
would
have
built
it
--
been
built
upon
navigable
waters,
upon
that
authorization.
i
think
it's
more
likely
to
say
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
there
are
cases
which
i
shall
allude
later,
the
--
in
the
--
one
in
the
state
of
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
which
in
the
case
of
a
bridge
across
the
albany
--
across
the
hudson
river
to
albany.
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
united
states
were
in
disagreement
as
to
what
kind
of
a
bridge
ought
to
built.
after
the
federal
government
had
authorized
construction
of
the
bridge,
the
state
undertook
to
keep
the
corporation,
a
new
york
corporation,
from
building
it
by
amending
its
charter,
cutting
down
the
time
within
which
it
could
build
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
that
couldn't
be
done
and
as
it
did
the
appellate
division
as
cited
in
our
brief,
people
vs.
hudson,
the
river
connecting
bridge
company.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
on
their
powers
derived
from
the
state.
the
whole
course
of
the
case
is
under
section
21.
it's
in
the
other
direction,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
--
that
surely
is
not
a
venue
statute
as
it's
called
below.in
this
court,
in
the
first
iowa
case,
marshaled
the
provisions
of
the
statute
which
protected
the
state
powers
and
those
which
asserted
the
federal
powers;
in
footnotes
of
1925
of
the
act
of
the
opinion.
and
in
the
marshalling
of
the
federal
powers,
it
said
that
the
detailed
provisions
of
the
act
providing
for
the
federal
plan
of
regulations
leave
no
room
or
need
for
conflicting
state
controls.
then,
on
a
footnote
to
that
statement,
it
listed
sections
of
the
act
that
it
so
characterized
and
among
others
in
section
21,
federal
powers
of
condemnation
vested
in
licensee.
now,
the
other
three
cases
in
this
court
which
have
mentioned
section
21,
don't
cast
a
great
deal
of
light
on
it
except
in
the
ford
&
son
versus
little
falls
fibre
company
also
cited.
it
says
by
section
21,
“licensees
are
given
the
power
of
eminent
domain
and
authorized
to
conduct
condemnation
proceedings
in
district
or
state
courts.”
in
a
--
a
case
cited
in
our
brief,
missouri
versus
the
union
electric
light
and
power
company,
a
private
power
company
which
was
a
licensee
under
the
federal
power
act
condemned
land
devoted
to
a
public
use
for
a
very
large
reservoir
including
lands
which
were
being
used
for
jails,
courthouses,
schools,
highways,
and
so
on.
and
the
court
sustained
the
exercise
with
the
power
of
eminent
domain
as
being
protected
by
the
federal
supremacy
clause,
so
also
with
the
alabama
power
company
versus
the
gulf
power
company.
now,
there
are,
as
the
court
knows,
any
number
of
cases
which
say
that
the
federal
government
itself
has
a
power
of
eminent
domain.
it
may
delegate
it
either
to
a
public
or
private
agencies
and
so
exercise
that
is
protected
by
the
supremacy
clause,
that
it
is
not
and
simply
acquiescing
in
the
exercise
of
a
state
created
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
the
language
in
those
statutes
which
is
summarized
in
our
brief
is
no
broader
than
the
language
in
section
21.
section
21
has
been
--
was
the
--
was
the
prototype
of
similar
language
in
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
has
been
construed
by
the
circuit
courts,
also
as
conferring
a
federal
power
of
eminent
domain.
now,
all
of
this
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
you're
correct
and
let's
examine
that
for
a
moment,
your
honor.
if
we
are
proceeding
now
with
a
--
a
specific
delegated
federal
power,
the
commerce
power
or
the
water
power,
we
say
that
when
the
states
have
delegated
that
power
to
the
federal
government
once,
in
the
federal
constitution,
it
is
not
requisite
to
the
federal
exercise
of
that
power
that
the
state
is
delegated
capacity
a
second
time
to
the
agent
selected
by
the
united
states
for
the
exercise
of
that
power.
if
any
other
conclusion
were
stated,
your
honors,
these
federal
powers
face
an
embargo
or
possibility
of
it
from
any
state
because
as
the
cases
are
clear,
there's
--
united
states
has
proceeded
throughout
its
history
by
delegating
the
power
of
eminent
domain
sometimes
to
federally
created
corporations,
sometimes
to
state-created
corporations,
and
in
some
cases,
has
conferred
powers
obviously
beyond
any
given
them
by
the
state.
for
example,
in
the
early
railroad
cases
in
central
pacific
versus
the
united
states,
california
had
authorized,
created
the
central
pacific
railroad
company
with
authority
to
build
from
sacramento
to
the
state
line.
the
united
states
by
statute
authorized
the
same
company,
a
state
corporation,
to
build
from
the
san
francisco
bay,
not
only
to
the
state
line
but
on
to
connect
with
union
pacific.
now,
that
is
one
of
a
series
of
cases
that
have
dealt
with
the
federal
exercise
with
the
federal
power
of
--
over
interstate
commerce
irrespective
of
whether
the
agent
it
selected
had
state
corporate
power
to
receive
that
authority.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
a
state
is
--
is
effecting
as
effectual
a
veto
upon
this
project
by
saying
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
let's
come
to
that,
your
honor.
if
the
creature
of
the
state
argument
is
sound,
if
it
disables
the
municipalities
of
the
state
of
washington
and
of
other
states
from
receiving
and
exercising
authority
under
federal
power
commission
licenses,
but
if
that
same
power
of
the
state
does
not
extend
to
foreign
corporations,
private
power
companies,
then
a
project
of
this
kind
could
be
built
only
by
the
united
states
or
by
a
foreign
private
power
company.
now,
that
is
not
the
intent
of
congress.section
--
section
7
of
the
act
specifically
here
directs
the
commission
to
grant
preference
to
municipalities,
to
public
agencies
in
the
granting
of
licenses.
if
a
public
agency
can
be
disabled,
not
by
a
statute
of
the
state
saying,
“no
licensee
shall
build
this
project,
but
by
silence”
so
that
the
game
commission
by
a
resolution
can
say,
‘we
decline
to
give
up
our
competing
use
of
this
stream.”
then,
neither
tacoma
nor
any
other
municipality
can
construct
this
project,
but
a
private
power
company
could.
now,
that
is
not
the
statutory
intent
and
as
i
will
develop
the
--
this
opportunity
and
as
our
brief
does
develop,
that
is
not
a
result
required
by
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
should
not
like
to
comment
upon
that,
your
honor.
that
--
but
it
does,
our
federalism
does
preclude
the
blocking
of
federal
powers
by
--
denied
its
state.
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
the
power
to
exercise
is
one
delegated
by
the
constitution
of
the
federal
government,
the
commerce
power
is,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
general
welfare
clause.
for
example,
take
another
clearly
delegated
federal
power.
i
don't
know
of
any
state
statute
of
washington
that
authorizes
tacoma
to
collect,
withhold
federal
income
taxes
from
its
employees
and
send
them
to
washington,
but
it
surely
has
the
power
to
do
it.
in
the
state-owned
belt
line
cases
in
san
francisco
where
the
belt
line
railroad
is
owned
by
the
state,
the
state
of
california,
on
two
occasions,
at
least,
has
resisted
the
application
of
federal
statutes
on
the
ground
that
the
state
was
involved.
one
was
the
safety
appliance
act,
one
was
the
railway
labor
act
cited
in
our
brief.
and
invoked
and
it's
through
this
court
has
said
that
when
a
state
places
itself,
and
i
think
for
that
matter,
or
the
authorized
creature,
in
the
orbit
of
the
federal
commerce
clause,
it
may
not,
thereafter,
say
you
have
not
the
authority
from
the
state
to
carry
out
the
federal
--
the
federal
order.
there
came
up
from
the
state
of
--
of
washington
a
case
which
we
cited
involving
the
--
the
office
of
price
administration,
orders
fixing
ceiling
prices
on
lumber.
the
state
said,
“this
can't
mean
us.
states
aren't
named
in
the
act.”
it
was
held
that
the
order
was
applicable
to
the
state,
nevertheless.
so,
let's
say
the
water
power
is
involved.
now,
if
the
--
if
the
united
states
is
to
be
circumscribed
in
selection
of
agents,
if
it
can't
select
a
municipality
under
section
seven
because
the
state
has
not
conferred
the
power
to
receive
that,
the
--
the
capacity
to
receive
that
power,
then
the
states
have
it
within
their
--
their
hand
to
veto
any
federal
project,
any
federal
licensed
project.
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
succession
of
efforts
by
state
authorities
to
restrict
the
operation
of
the
federal
power
act;
new
jersey
versus
sargent,
the
oregon
versus
the
federal
power
commission,
this
case,
the
appalachian
case,
the
whole
series
of
them,
the
first
iowa
case.
now
--
and
none
of
them
was
it
successful.but
the
way
is
open,
if
we're
wrong
here
for
any
state
to
acquire
a
land
within
a
reservoir
area
devoted
to
a
public
use,
any
public
use,
and
say
this
land
cannot
be
taken
under
eminent
domain,
the
federal
power
of
eminent
domain
under
section
21.
now,
the
fact
that
the
state
of
washington
might
not
do
it
isn't
the
point.
they're
dealing
with
the
constitutional
question
at
that
stage.
and
we
say
again
that
the
--
neither
the
constitution
nor
the
federal
power
act
require
any
such
results.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
think
so,
yes.
for
the
purpose
of
present
argument,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
yes.
surely
if
tacoma
seems
to
exist,
there's
no
licensee,
but
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
but
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
but
we
say
that
that
cannot
--
that
i
would
go
further,
your
honor,
and
say
that
a
state
statute
which
attempted
to
specifically
disable
a
municipality
from
proceeding
under
a
federal
license,
might
very
well
be
held
invalid
on
various
grounds,
testa
versus
katt
and
--
and
others.
if
it
was
held
from
a
municipality
to
do
for
the
united
states
or
what
the
united
states
may
do
through
another
agency,
but
the
state
may
not
control
the
selection
by
the
united
states
of
its
agents
nor
may
it
deny
them
the
power
that
the
--
that
is
delegated
by
other
commerce
power
to
them.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
yes,
your
honor,
and
we're
perhaps
on
the
threshold
of
that.
all
that
stops
us
here
is
a
resolution
of
the
game
commission.
five
years
after
the
proceedings
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
brought
this
case
to
a
conclusion
we
thought
and
this
resolution
is
adopted
eight
days
after
they
petitioned
for
leave
to
intervene.
a
resolution
adopted
solely
in
aid
of
this
litigation.
now,
the
state
game
commission
by
saying,
“we
won't
sell
a
hatchery
which
will
--
if
you
build
higher
than
110
feet
or
upon
let's
say,
will
flood.
you
can't
build.”
whereas,
a
statute
of
the
state
of
washington
saying,
“you
can't
build
higher
than
25
feet,”
has
been
struck
down
in
the
court
below.
it's
a
curious
result
that
the
federal
power
should
be
disabled
by
this
administrative
finding
of
the
state
commission.
these
are
competing
uses
of
the
same
waterway.
now,
i
don't
say
that
if
you
had
a
case
where
the
state
capital
was
in
this
reservoir
area
or
an
essential
governmental
function
of
some
kind
that
you
wouldn't
have
a
place
between
federal
and
state
powers,
perhaps
the
tenth
amendment
involved,
which
would
produce
a
different
result.
you
don't.
you
have
competing
uses
of
the
same
waterway.
now,
this
hatchery
is
fed
a
by
a
spring
as
it
run
into
the
-
the
cowlitz
river.
it
--
it
had
to
be
moved
400
up
feet
closer
to
the
spring
to
get
them
out
of
the
way.
now,
when
there
is
a
competing
use
of
the
same
waterway
controlled
under
a
plenary
federal
power
under
the
appellation
decision,
the
united
states
has
plenary
power
for
the
development
of
these
waterways.
we
say
that
the
power
of
condemnation
is
an
inherent
and
essential
element
of
the
comprehensive
plan
of
development
set
up
by
the
federal
power
act
and
that
it
may
not
be
defeated
in
this
--
in
this
manner.
i
invite
--
i
--
going
to
ask
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
shall
ask,
your
honor's
particular
attention
to
a
--
a
case
which
we
cite,
the
stockton
versus
the
baltimore
and
new
york
railroad
company
in
1887.
that
is
a
case
that
is
by
a
decision
by
mr.
justice
bradley
of
the
circuit.
it's
been
quoted
or
cited
by
this
court
four
times
with
approval,
most
recently
in
the
united
states
versus
cormack
in
1926,
and
it
spells
out
the
elements
of
this
question
of
positive
versus
negative
authority
to
build
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
32
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
right,
in
1887.
we
think
that
the
result
here
is
necessarily
a
algebraic
sum
of
the
holdings
in
the
stockton
case,
in
the
first
iowa
case
and
now,
the
united
states
versus
cormack,
and
oklahoma
ex
rel.
phillips
versus
atkinson,
and
that
the
authority
that
the
united
states
is
asserting
here
necessarily
must
have
as
a
component,
the
full
utilization
of
section
21.
that's
what
this
eminent
domain
delegation
in
the
federal
part
is
for;
to
break
bottlenecks.
and
as
i
said
and
they
enlightened
that
case
which
we
also
cite,
what
the
case
comes
down
to
is
this.
can
congress
constitutionally
confer
upon
this
licensee
the
authority
to
take
this
land?
if
it
cannot,
then
this
project
found
by
the
commission
to
be
desirable
and
--
and
necessary
justified
in
the
public
interest,
in
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power
cannot
be
built,
certainly
not
by
a
municipality
query
whether
it
can
be
built
by
any
corporation
and
that
is
not
the
intent
of
the
power
act
nor
as
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
i
understand
from
the
marshal,
i
have
13
minutes.
first,
will
--
will
your
honors
turn
to
page
175
of
the
record.
there
appears
the
resolution
of
the
state
game
commission
adopted
august
16,
1955.
it
--
it
is
not
a
resolution
inviting
the
city
of
tacoma
to
build
a
new
hatchery
first.
it's
a
resolution
that
says
this,
“therefore,
the
commission
finds
the
mossyrock
hatchery
in
its
present
location
to
be
completely
irreplaceable
and
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
its
fishery
program
on
the
cowlitz
river
and
necessary
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
acquired
that
instructs
the
director
to
take
every
legal
procedure
to
resist
any
effort
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
tacoma
or
anyone
else
to
condemn
or
in
any
other
manner
acquire
or
impair
the
operations
of
the
mossyrock
hatchery
as
such
acquisition
or
impairment
would
be
disadvantageous
to
the
state
of
washington
and
inconsistent
with
the
public
interests.
now,
there
is
nowhere,
any
place
in
this
record
any
allegation
that
the
city
of
tacoma
is
failing
to
comply
with
the
conditions
which
the
federal
power
commission
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
upon
which
question,
sir?
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
they
struck
down
the
six
statutes
and
repeated
as
affirmative
bar.
they
restricted
their
decision
to
the
lack
of
capacity
of
the
city
of
tacoma
to
receive
and
exercise
the
power
under
its
federal
license
specifically
section
21
is
condemned.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
your
honor,
we
raised
that
very
quite
after
this
resolution
was
annexed
to
the
states
pleading,
which
for
the
first
time
in
1955,
asking
injunction
upon
that
ground.
tacoma's
answer
stated
that
that
question
was
not
properly
before
the
court.
that
we
had
not
as
yet
exhausted
the
power
of
negotiations
where
the
state
game
commission
hadn't
started
negotiating
and
that
that
question
was
not
--
it
should
not
be
decided.
the
trial
court
held
with
us.
it
said
that
question
was
not
before
the
court.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
reversed
him
on
that
point,
said
it
was.
now,
i
--
i
think
in
justice
to
the
lower
court's
opinion
that
we're
inviting
you
to
reverse,
there
is
something
to
the
point
that
the
lower
court
made
that
that
issue
did
have
to
be
decided
in
this
validation
proceeding
on
our
bonds
because
that
there
was
a
--
an
inseparable
obstacle
to
the
construction
of
the
project
it
would
obviously
make
the
sale
of
revenue
bonds
for
the
construction
of
that
project
improbable.
and
consequently,
if
there
was
a
point
--
a--
a
--
and
obstacle,
it
was
appropriate
that
the
supreme
court
take
it
up
and
pass
upon
it.
what
we
say
is
that
that
same
obstacle
should
have
been
presented.
we
think
it
was
before
the
power
commission
in
the
ninth
circuit.
surely,
the
point
just
made
here
a
few
minutes
ago
is
precisely
the
type
that
should
go
before
the
expert
the
power
commission.
should
it
or
should
it
not
require
that
before
doing
anything
we
build
a
hatchery
and
start
--
start
the
seed
stock.
now,
what
they
did
after
hearing
nearly
4,000
pages
of
testimony
much
of
it
on
this
very
type
of
thing
of
how
to
protect
fish
was
to
insert
at
page
46
of
the
record,
two
conditions
of
the
license,
articles
30
and
31,
that
before
beginning
the
construction
of
any
permanent
fish
ladders
and
so
on
that
the
study
should
carry
out
experiments
in
cooperation
with
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
game
and
the
fisheries
department
should
make
quarterly
reports
to
the
commission
and
so
on.
and
that
thereafter,
this
licensee
should
construct
such
hatcheries,
such
fish
ladders
and
so
on
as
the
commission
should
on
its
own
motion
direct
or
is
upon
the
recommendation
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
now,
so
far
as
the
record
shows
those
--
those
two
conditions
have
been
complied
with.
so
far
as
i
know,
the
investigations
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
have
--
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
record
contains
--
as
i
start
to
say
no
allegation
to
the
contract.
the
point
made
here
in
argument
that
tacoma
should
have
started
long
ago.
it
is
not
pleaded.
there's
nothing
to
support
the
allegation
that
were
not
proceeding
in
the
court
with
the
license.
the
implication,
the
assumption
should
be
that
we
are
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
and
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
so
far
as
the
principle
of
what
you're
inquiring
about
is
concerned,
of
--
of
course
there's
no
objection.
insofar
as
the
practice
is
concerned,
there
very
well
may
be
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
as
a
--
as
a
practical
application
of
it.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
i
don't
yet
know
what
--
we've
been
delayed
10
years.
i
don't
know
what
the
next
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
--
obstacle
is
going
to
be.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
would
say
yes,
sir.
one
year
of
it
was
lost
waiting
for
the
trial
judge
to
rule
upon
or
demur
to
the
state's
amended
answer
after
we'd
won
on
--
in
demur
on
the
supreme
court
as
we
waited
a
year
and
one
month
for
a
ruling.
and
then
they
started
construction
and
thereupon,
the
state
to
intervene
with
this
injunction
proceeding.
now,
your
honor,
to
answer
your
question
directly,
the
license
is
explicit.
the
remedies
for
enforcement
of
a
license
are
--
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
united
states,
presumably
the
license
will
be
enforced.
we
intend
to
comply
with
it.
we
have
so
far.
and
there
is
no
ruling
to
--
there's
no
reason
to
anticipate
and
make
an
monitory
injunction
or
ruling
of
some
kind
saying
that
we
really
mean
it.
of
course,
the
license
means
what
it
says.
we'll
conform
to
it.
now,
if
the
commission
--
power
commission,
it
elsewhere,
it
reserves
the
authority
to
reexamine
the
question
of
the
fish
protection
in
the
opinion
accompanying
the
license.
as
this
investigation,
this
process
of
trying
out
these
devices
proceeds,
the
commission
may
very
well
say,
“we
want
further
proof.
do
this
or
that.”
it's
an
administrative
matter
in
the
hands
of
experts
and
that's
where
it
belongs.
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
possible
to
frame
a
decree
that
substitutes
for
their
judgment
in
that
trial.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
if
i
understood
him
correctly,
we
will
--
assuming
that
we
prevailed
here,
we
would
--
i
suppose
resume
negotiation
to
try
to
buy
the
hatchery.
with
those
failing,
we
would
initiate
condemnation
proceedings.
in
what
court
and
under
what
terms
it's
not
before
this
tribunal
now.
the
eleventh
amendment
was
referred
to
earlier.
the
--
the
court
had
that
problem
in
--
in
california
versus
taylor.
and
in
the
footnote
said
that
problem
isn't
here.
that's
for
another
day.
in
the
later
suit
if
whenever
it
becomes
necessary.
now,
as
to
being
destructive
of
the
hatchery,
we
would
institute
condemnation
proceedings.
we
would
in
accord
with
the
requirements
of
the
power
commission
build
such
hatcheries
at
such
time
and
such
place
as
they
tell
us
to
and
those
were
to
be
built
in
cooperation
with
the
investigations
of
the
state
game
commission,
the
fisheries
commission.
that
it
is
not
and
never
has
been
in
this
record
any
indication
of
a
desire
by
the
city
of
tacoma
to
wantonly
destroy
the
fishery
resource.
to
the
contrary,
the
commission
found
that
the
values
of
the
fish
above
may
fill
the
reservoir
were
of
the
order
of
$600,000
per
year.
this
is
costing
the
city
of
tacoma,
the
commission
found
--
it's
in
the
record,
$610,000
a
year
just
to
maintain
and
operate
these
facilities
more
than
the
entire
resource
being
saved.
it
required
us
to
build
hatcheries,
fish
ladders,
elevators,
whatever
that
cost
$9.5
million
that
are
far
easier
to
pay
for.
now,
the
--
the
issue
of
fish
versus
power
as
mr.
john
--
john
lynch
indicated
as
long
since
it
was
raised
up,
disposed
of
by
the
power
commission
and
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
court
below
refused
to
reopen
and
pass
upon
those,
although
invited
by
the
state
to
revive
the
issue
of
the
fish
sanctuary
act.
we
have
solely
the
question
here
of
whether
the
--
as
the
court
below
said,
whether
the
federal
power
of
eminent
domain
tested
and
we
think
in
the
licensee
by
section
21
may
be
exercised
to
carry
out
a
project
which
without
the
exercise
of
that
power
is
blocked
--
blocked
by
this
resolution
of
the
power
commission
absent
action
by
the
state
to
confer
duplicate
authority
upon
that
licensee.
and
for
the
reasons
i
indicated
earlier,
we
think
the
answer
has
to
be
in
the
affirmative
or
as
was
suggested
by
a
question,
the
entire
federal
power
program
under
the
federal
power
act
in
this
area
just
ordered.
it
now
seems
to
be
conceded
that
no
licensee
could
proceed
under
the
federal
power
act
upon
the
cowlitz
river
as
long
as
this
fishery
hatchery
remains
there.
in
the
earlier
opinions,
it
wasn't
so
clear,
the
implications
left,
perhaps,
a
foreign
corporation
or
a
private
power
company
could
do
so.
now,
under
the
decision
in
the
seaboard
air
line
case
versus
daniel,
it's
clear
that
congress
can
supersede
state
laws,
confer
additional
authority
upon
a
corporation
not
conferred
by
the
state
that
a
state
cannot
keep
such
a
corporation
from
entering
and
carrying
out
those
federally
conferred
extra
charter
authorities.
the
same
result
had
been
reached
in
earlier
case,
the
united
--
the
texas
versus
united
states
where
it
was
--
the
state
decree
to
the
corporation
was
objected.
in
the
chapman
--
in
u.s.
ex
rel.
chapman
versus
the
federal
power
commission,
your
honors
have
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
functions
of
the
federal
power
commission
under
this
act
are
very
much
like
the
functions
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
the
transportation
act
of
1920
which
was
involved
in
those
cases.
others
--
the
question
was
asked
earlier
with
respect
to
this
res
judicata
matter.
i
don't
insist
to
recall
its
res
judicata.
it's
a
question
of
finality
of
--
of
proceedings.
the
statute
provided
an
exclusive
--
exclusive
method
of
review,
section
313
(b).
that
was
exhausted
more
than
four
years
ago.
this
type
of
problem
should
have
been
presented
to
the
commission.
shall
you
put
into
the
license
order
more
conditions
than
you
did,
timing
for
putting
in
of
the
substitute
hatchery.
and
if
the
commission
didn't
agree,
it
should
have
been
raised
with
the
ninth
circuit.
none
of
that
was
done.
instead
--
if
i
had
time,
i
should
read
the
allegations
made
in
the
commission,
made
on
the
briefs
that
evoke
entirely
to
the
question
of
power,
that
the
city
of
tacoma
cannot
take
these
lands,
beds
and
banks
of
the
stream
owned
by
the
state.
this
is
“riparian
tract.”
the
hatchery
is
on
“riparian
land.”
it
is
the
banks
with
the
stream.
the
dominant
federal
navigation
servitude
extents
were
taught
by
the
twin
city
case
and
by
the
oklahoma
ex
rel.
phillips
versus
atkinson
case
to
reservoir
areas
that
are
required
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
--
of
the
project.
it
is
not
limited
to
the
--
to
the
lands
that
are
--
that
are
wet
by
the
stream
in
its
natural
state.
this
is
a
prime
case
where
the
federal
preeminent
power
of
eminent
domain
which
is
entitled
to
the
same
protection
of
the
supremacy
clause
as
is
the
commerce
power
itself
when
used
in
aid
of
the
commerce
power
should
be
good
in
full
effect.
thank
you,
your
honors.
