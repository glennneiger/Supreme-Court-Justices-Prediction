justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
deal
with
both
the
statute
and
the
constitutional
provision?
they
did
both,
yes
they
did.
now
these
petitioners
are
not
the
only
persons
or
churches
in
california
who
felt
themselves
unable
to
sign
the
oath,
there
are
two
cases
pending
before
your
honors,
in
the
form
of
an
appeal
in
which
this
court
has
not
acted
upon
the
appeal,
they
are
on
behalf
of
the
first
methodist
church
of
san
leandro
and
the
first
unitarian
church
of
berkeley.
first
methodist
church
of
san
leandro
as
appears
from
the
record
in
this
court,
in
that
case
deemed
that
methodist
discipline
prevented
it.
if
it
were
to
comply
with
methodist
discipline
from
complying
with
this
requirement,
the
first
--
these
two
churches
with
leave
of
this
court
have
filed
briefs
amici,
as
has
the
philadelphia
yearly
meeting
of
the
religious
society
of
friends
in
southern
california.
the
orange
grove
yearly
meeting
took
the
position
that
this
requirement
violated
its
conscience
and
its
commitment
to
christ
and
therefore
that
it
was
unable
to
comply
with
this
requirement.
now
in
a
word,
the
nub
of
the
argument
which
i
shall
present
is
something
like
this,
that
the
requirements,
particularly
again
the
statutory
requirements,
open
due
process
because
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
and
more
particularly
those,
i'm
still
stating
the
summary
of
my
argument,
that
on
the
one
hand
there
is
no
support
for
the
legislation
or
the
constitutional
amendment
in
any
real
need
or
any
real
danger
existing
in
california
warranting
this
or
similar
legislation
on
the
one
hand.
and
on
the
other,
the
requirements
are
so
broad
and
sweeping,
affecting
thousands,
hundreds
of
thousands
more
than
a
million
persons
in
california,
are
so
broad
and
sweeping
on
the
one
hand
and
so
deep
and
offensive
and
intrusion
into
privacy
and
into
the
privacy
of
the
spirit
and
the
mind
of
man,
so
that
a
balancing
of
any
real
concern
for
national
security
of
california
on
the
one
hand
and
off
the
sweeping
inroads
on
the
other
by
this
legislation
would
require
this
court,
assuming
this
court
were
to
adopt
and
follow
the
narrowest
kind
of
jurisdiction
which
it
could
take,
assuming
this
court
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
most
reluctantly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
was
involved
here
as
state
legislation,
as
distinguished
from
federal
legislation
in
giving
the
states
the
widest
reasonable
scope
for
authority
in
dealing
with
so
difficult
a
problem
as
national
security,
assuming
all
these
--
that
this
legislation
opens
federal
due
process.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
a
state
income
tax
law
in
california?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
state
income
tax
law
has
this
oath
on
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
does,
every
income
tax?
justice
john
m.
harlan
dependance
exemption?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
next
cases
involve
the
application,
individual
taxpayers,
aren't
they,
the
cases
that
follow
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
all
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
california
constitutionally
withdraw
tax
exemptions
from
churches?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
churches,
i'm
taking
about
(inaudible)
denominations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
this
oath
as
you
call
it
had
been
that
the
church
does
not
advocate
any
conduct
which
should
be
a
violation
of
the
smith
act,
would
that
be
all
right
or
would
that
be
bad?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
figures
on
the
referendum
in
the
record,
what
was
the
vote?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
total
vote,
do
you
remember
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
a
matter
of
public
record
i
suppose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
just
so
i
get
this
correctly,
mr.
wirin
has
spoken
of
some
them,
did
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
this
income
tax.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
this
declaration
had
been
that
the
church,
the
organization
doesn't
believe
in
communism,
your
position
would
be
any
different?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
all
it
says,
officers
of
the
church
must
sign
a
declaration
that
the
organization,
church
organization
doesn't
believe
in
communism.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
say
anything
about
action
to
the
overthrow
of
government
in
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
action
for
overthrow?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
how
you
read
them
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
declaration
as
to
the
statute
has
to
be
construed
that
way
in
order
to
sustain
your
in
order
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
sustain
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
would
you
strip
all
the
language
of
it,
it's
to
keep
communists
out
of
the
churches.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
to
get
the
church's
support
to
keep
communists
out
of
the
--
keep
them
out
from
their
numbers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
this
provision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
legislative
discussion
of
this
statute
after
the
referendum?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
their
lawyers
argue
--
i
was
wondering
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
that
it's
directed
towards
communists
or
some
other
(inaudible)
in
california.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
talk
about
communists?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
talk
about
communists?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
suppose
that
the
church
was
so
advises
to
take
up
advocacy
of
about
overthrowing
the
government
(inaudible)
