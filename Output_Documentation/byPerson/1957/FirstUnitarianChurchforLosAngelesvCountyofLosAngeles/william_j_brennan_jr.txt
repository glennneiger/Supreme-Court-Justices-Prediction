justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry,
i've
lost
track
of
this,
what
is
this
document
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
does
it
have
significance
for
our
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
follow
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
the
general
sweep
of
the
constitutional
provision,
not
so
much
of
the
particular
statute
under
which
this
exemption
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
so
this
legislation
you
have
at
your
appendix
a?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
deals
with
property
tax,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
property
tax,
how
do
we
get
the
income
taxpayer
oath
into
that?
talks
about
claim,
any
exemption
from
any
property
tax
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
as
to
this
fact
i
gather
both
the
veterans'
exemption
as
well
as
the
exemption
of
the
petitioners
here
is
from
property
tax,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
both
those
classes
at
least
the
section
32
is
evolving.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
legislation
on
the
income
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
includes
(inaudible)
veterans
exceptions
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let's
say
you
want
to
--
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
eliminate
that
activity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
to
eliminate
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
eliminate
it,
or
to
discourage
something
or
to
eliminate
something
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
doesn't
something
have
to
exist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
the
evidence
that
it
does?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
boller
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
at
least
to
appear
that
for
some
reasonable
relationship
of
this
non-advocacy
provision
to
the
elimination
of
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
behavior,
well
that
complies
with
something
to
be
bettered
with
it,
what
was
to
be
bettered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
again
that
there
was
some
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unlawful
by
what
law
mr.
boller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
is
that
the
law
of
new
jersey
might
--
it's
unlawful
in
new
jersey
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
california
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
boller
may
i
ask
you
about
one
other,
what's
the
reference
in
the
other
half
of
the
statement,
"nor
advocate
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
event
of
hostilities."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
at
the
time
these
were
executed,
were
we
at
war
with
any
foreign
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
were
between
1952
and
1953.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
purpose
does
this
serve?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
that
the
church
doesn't
get
up
now
and
say
if
ever
we
go
to
war
with
a
foreign
power,
we
advocate
that
we
don't
support
or
that
we
support
the
foreign
government,
whoever
it
might
be
against
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
advocacy
that
we
don't
use
the
h-bomb
on
hostilities,
those
who
are
actually
at
war,
would
the
church
would
advocate
it
that
we
not
use
the
h-bomb,
would
that
supporting
a
foreign
power?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
your
answer
mr.
boller
suggest
the
vagueness
of
the
statute?
what
is
supportive
of
a
foreign
government,
what
is
advocating
the
support
of
a
foreign
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
boller
your
constitution
says
that
that's
what
the
(inaudible),
statement
has
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
wonder
whether
--
perhaps
your
board
of
assessors
might
not
feel
no
regard,
i'm
they
have
been
advised
that
the
constitution
says
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
boller,
it
all
have
sum
up
to
this
and
also
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
not
that
there
is
any
present
infiltration
of
these
petitioner
churches
or
any
other,
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
thing
is
to
keep
the
churches
on
their
toes
against
being
infiltrated
by
those
who
might
turn
them
away
from
the
things
that
the
court
has
said
are
the
objectives
they
are
there
to
serve,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
keep
them
on
their
toes,
to
keep
themselves
cleansed
on
any
possible
infiltrators
who
might
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
not
that
there
are
any
there
now,
but
just
against
the
chance
that
some
day
some
might
come
there,
this
would
keep
the
churches
on
their
toes.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that,
that's
what
i'm
assuming.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they
don't
advocate,
none
of
these
petitioners
churches
does
and
the
only
reason
for
attaching
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
can
assume
that
they
do
not.
at
least
we
can
assume
that
they
will
not
on
this
record,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
this
record
how
do
you
want
us
to
approach
this,
on
the
premise
if
they
do
advocate
or
in
the
premise
they
do
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
borrow
it
though
mr.
boller.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
when
they
--
when
they
fail
to
maintain
the
state
established
standards
then
they
lose
the
privilege,
the
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
it
is
a
state
established
standard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
churches
must
guide
themselves
if
they
have
the
privilege
of
the
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
then
if
that's
so,
justice
burton
question
isn't
particularly
pertinent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
about
--
at
the
same
time
we
found
unlawful
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
it
is
--
if
it
is
what
about
the
rest
of
us,
no
advocacy,
would
that
stand
by
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
are
you
telling
me
that
if
we
had
to
find
that
the
support
and
unlawful
means
were
both
vague
then
we
have
to
strike
the
whole
statute
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
would
be
less?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
there
were
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
sure
roman
catholic
church
there's
no
difficulty
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
did
sign
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
