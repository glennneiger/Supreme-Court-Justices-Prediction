justice
william
o.
douglas
you
mean
that
the
churches
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
can
get
tax
exemption?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
do
you
mean
that
activity?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
evidence
that
this
group
is
advocating?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
misled
me
on
when
you
said
it
would
discourage
this
activity
or
that
activity.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
evidence
that
the
churches
or
some
churches
that
churches
in
general
are
subversive
units
in
society?
justice
william
o.
douglas
going
back
to
your
question
that
your
discouraging
something,
i
wondered
what
was
happening
that
was
being
discouraged?
what
was
happening
in
the
churches
that
was
being
discouraged
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
the
churches
of
california?
do
we
take
notice
of
that
or
is
there
evidence
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
comes
up
on
demurrer.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
the
church
officially
believes
and
stands
for?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
remember
when
we
still
at
war
with
japan
(inaudible)
hiroshima,
weren't
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
kind
of
an
act
be
covered
by
this
oath?
justice
william
o.
douglas
all
had
to
sign
but
one,
your
point
would
just
be
the
same
i
guess.
