where
you

(inaudible)
you
know
in

there
many
people
of
different
kinds
(inaudible)
justice

l.
black
and
this
man
had
been
(inaudible),
yet
he
swore
that
the
institution
didn't
do
that,
could
you
convict
him
of
perjury?
justice

black
suppose
the

i
believe
in
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the

by
advocating
the

you'd
say
(inaudible)
justice

black
that
he
had
to
be
all
tried
out
under

under
--
in
each
trial
to
see
how
many
people
there
were
who
said
something,
how
likely
he
was
to
have
known
it,
as
his
secretary,
how
could
he
speak
for
1000
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
suffer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
so
far
as
the
man
(inaudible)
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
tell
the
court
(inaudible);
what
would
you
advise
as
you
are
the
advisor
for
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
your
opinion
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
next
church
that
came
along
and
said
we
like
this,
they
don't
like
this,
this
is
the
first
part,
we
just
came,
now
this
first
part
we
just
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
let
him
off
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
state
was
to
require
the
churches
to
maintain
high
ideals
and
advocate
high
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
wants
to
require
the
churches
to
maintain
doctrines
that
the
state
deems
to
be
high
and
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you,
how
do
you
escape
that
(inaudible)
if
it's
true
as
perceived
from
your
statement
is
--
purpose
of
the
state
is
to
induce
by
attempting
and
(inaudible)
churches
observe
standards
of
(inaudible)
in
connection
with
the
efficacy
of
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
question
was,
how
do
you
--
how
can
it
be
said
that
there
is
not
a
(inaudible)
church's
doctrine
if
this
is
done
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
requiring
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
requiring
to
maintain
high
standards
of
doctrine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
judgment
of
the
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
trying
to
assess
the
one
that
the
legislature
has
acted
on
up
to
this
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
purpose
is
as
i
understood
you
to
see
the
state,
that
the
church
maintain
doctrine
according
to
the
definition
of
those
doctrines
by
the
state
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
separability
clause?
