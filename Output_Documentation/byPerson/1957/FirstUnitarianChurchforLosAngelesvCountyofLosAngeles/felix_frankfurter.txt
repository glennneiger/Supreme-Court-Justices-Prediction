justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
putting
before
us
what
a
--
what
the
legislation
is
(inaudible)
to
invalidate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
--
i
know
that
you've
been
left
but
i
don't
know
why.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
by
a
referendum
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
california,
is
there
an
official
statement
for
and
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
printed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
the
pro
and
con
is
--
is
that
prepared
under
the
state
authority?
some
--
some
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
somebody
who's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
who
--
who
doesn't
--
who
apparently
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
there
must
be
somebody
that
makes
them,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
filed?
have
you
had
filed
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably
the
--
presumably,
the
argument
that
prevailed
by
the
popular
referendum
is
an
expression,
whatever,
a
constitutional
provision.
and
here
the
people
of
california
whom
america
had
adopted
it,
that
they
removed
(inaudible)
to
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
there
was
a
constitutional
oath
to
the
constitutional
amendment
in
california,
which
was
then
translated
into
action
into
the
particular
act
by
the
legislature.
you're
saying
the
statutes
as
they
stand,
in
offenses
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
further
saying
that
the
light
that
might
be
shed
by
the
constitutional
provision
as
illuminated
by
those
who
opposed
that
official
declaration,
in
and
itself,
by
attacking
that
was
also
attacking
the
means
of
carrying
it
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
your
argument
narrow
point
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
your
second
point
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what
is
the
narrow
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
respective
numbers
of
those
who
signed
or
not
signed,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
very
relevant
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wonder
why
you
spend
so
much
time
about
the
newness
of
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
this
argument
is
not
that
it's
a
new
one
but
it's
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
of
the
separation
from
the
mother
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
act
covered
(inaudible)
is
it
covered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
the
requirement
of
every
person
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
thought
the
specific
question
before
us
was
whether
it's
true
in
order
to
obtain
the
(inaudible),
but
i
gather
from
you
that
that's
wrong
and
it's
not
the
question
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
veterans.
justice
felix
frankfurter
asking
for
a
licence
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
specific
question
whether
such
requirement
of
an
oath
will
be
exacted
from
the
church
in
order
to
claim
the
exemption
that
church
properties
have?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wirin,
is
your
answer
that
it
couldn't
give
exemption
to
everybody
else
except
churches,
is
that
what
you
understand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
was
a
statutue
(inaudible)
statewide
unlimited,
unqualified
(inaudible)
but
without
any
discrimination
to
that,
and
the
(inaudible)
or
from
a
firm,
i
take
it,
no
point
in
taking
the
(inaudible)
where
the
firm
impels
--
is
not
engaged
in
(inaudible)
the
government
of
united
states
(inaudible)
and
does
not
knowingly
belog
to
any
organization
permitted
to
entitle
to
oath
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
answer
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
state,
every
taxpayer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
that
california
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
no
distinction
between
these
terms
(inaudible)
you
make
no
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
are
they,
the
differences?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
legislator
of
california
(inaudible)
possibly
satisfy
if
i
do
digress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
congress
of
the
united
states
in
every
state
has
manifested
in
some
way
that
there's
some
(inaudible),
and
california
chooses
to
say,
we
would
like
everybody
to
swear
that
(inaudible)
everybody
that
it
doesn't
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
we
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i've
made
a
distinction
(inaudible)
an
oath
like
this,
using
words
like
other
unlawful
means
under
specific
terms
that
i
put
to
you.
i
thought
i
have
(inaudible)
on
this
subject
in
the
garner
case
(inaudible)
that's
all
unimportant,
because
you
want
to
get
as
broader
decision
as
possible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
it
got
in
by
just
one
vote?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
relation
between
the
extra
financial
burden
(inaudible)
the
oath,
what
is
the
relation
between
that
extra
financial
burden
and
the
public's
interest
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
where
in
the
form
of
oath
that
is
required
that
the
client
(inaudible)
whatever
the
words
in
this
case
because
i
wanted
to
know
who
it
is,
the
question
that
justice
black
asked
earlier.
i
would
like
to
know
who
it
is,
swear
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
my
eyes,
where
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
another
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
language
of
the
oath,
an
oath
is
taken
by
an
animate,
by
someone
person
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
someone
in
person
for
somebody
else.
now
who
would
be
the
affiant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
he
swear
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
tell
me
approximately
what
the
membership
if
it
would
be
membership,
i
am
still
informed
in
these
matter,
on
the
first
unitarian
church
of
los
angeles,
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
--
who
constitutes
that
congregation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
what,
500
or
5000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
1000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
who
can
speak
for
the
views
of
that
collectivity
called
the
first
unitarian
church
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
they
declined
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
first
action
and
the
meaning
of
that
isn't
before
us,
but
what
is
before
us
is
whether
they
could
be
coerced
in
making
such
a
--
in
having
the
secretary
take
such
an
oath?
what
i
am
asking
you
is,
how
can
the
secretary
of
the
first
unitarian
church
(inaudible)
take
an
oath
as
to
what
the
congregation
believed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
he
tell
whether
they
advocate
the
overthrow,
how
can
he
tell
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
this
case
that's
a
coerced
action
in
order
to
create
this
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
no
meaning
so
far
as
the
question
that
i'm
putting
to
you
namely
what
is
that
the
state
can
(inaudible)
to
the
secretary
or
the
senior
warden
or
the
director
of
a
church
to
swear
to
when
he
swears
that
this
church,
or
that
this
congregation
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
or
other
unlawful
means?
how
can
any
human
being
of
a
church
take
an
oath
as
to
what
the
church
believes
regarding
other
unlawful
means,
how
can
it
--
and
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know
the
free
choice
is
that
either
he
has
to
sign
this
for
the
congregation
or
they
don't
get
exemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
--
but
if
you
put
a
choice
that
the
state
is
not
empowered
to
put
that
it
isn't
the
free
choice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
can
reject
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
so
we
get
to
the
question
of
what
it
is
or
asking
the
secretary
of
a
1000
members
of
the
unitarian
church,
how
can
he
take
an
oath
as
to
what
those
1000
people
think
are
or
are
not
lawful
or
unlawful
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
but
(inaudible)
accepting
the
corporate
way
under
which
--
under
your
laws
they
can
sign
or
leave,
but
when
it
comes
to
avowing
what
is
the
(inaudible)
or
purposes
of
a
1000
people,
how
can
any
conscientious
man
go
down
and
swear
what
1000
people
think
or
don't
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
the
church
--
does
any
church
stand
for
--
i
mean
is
it
the
normal
manifestation
of
the
likes
of
the
church
that
it
takes
the
position
by
the
ordinary
vote
of
what
it
thinks
about
political
issues,
is
that
the
normal
manifestation
of
the
church?
i
don't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
order
to
get
this
litigation
to
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
raised
whether
you
could
exact
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
if
the
secretary
says,
i'm
the
secretary
of
the
first
unitarian
church,
and
i
hereby
file
a
piece
of
paper
so
that
you
may
get
relief
whatever
the
sum
is,
$1000
a
year
that
doesn't
require
finding
out
what's
in
the
minds
of
the
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
frame
within
which
he
moved,
secretary
of
a
corporation
or
(inaudible)
or
it
could
be
the
secretary
of
this
church
(inaudible),
incorporating
the
churches,
those
activities
are
very
narrow
and
confined,
they
deal
with,
relate
to
commercial
matters,
making
a
contract
with
the
secretary
or
the
minister,
making
arrangements
for
(inaudible)
or
whatnot,
those
are
all
confined,
narrowly
constricted,
simple
uncomplicated
matters
that
do
not
touch
(inaudible),
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
a
secretary
being
able
to
say
what
a
church
congregation,
what
a
church
community
believes,
what
associations
it
has
and
what
(inaudible),
whether
if
some
church
members
or
most
of
them
(inaudible),
whether
that's
contestable,
an
organization
that
promotes
(inaudible).
how
can
unless
california
at
least
has
machinery
to
find
for
ascertaining
the
views
on
such
matters
on
the
responsibility
of
(inaudible),
how
can
a
secretary
see
that
conglomerate
body
called
a
church
congregation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
says
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
other
unlawful
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
a
church
like
any
other
organization
that
every
member
has
the
same
moral
authority
and
there
maybe
one
or
two
members
of
an
organization
in
a
church
who
if
it
came
to
be
known
that
he
or
she
was
and
still
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
would
at
once
bring
into
contradiction
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
that
church
(inaudible),
the
treasurer,
if
that's
who
he
is
of
the
state
of
california,
i'm
sure
would
cut
off
the
exemption
and
go
to
court
(and
have
it
litigated,
am
i
(inaudible)
what
i'm
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
there
is
disclosure
that
one
or
two
very
leading
members
of
the
church
in
fact
out
of
the
goodness
of
their
misinformed
hearts,
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
and
at
once
your
officials
would
say
he
is
so
influential
that
he
really
dominated
the
church,
that's
been
known
hasn't
it?
one
or
two
people
are
more
controlling
than
others
in
the
church.
how
can
you
--
how
can
this
kind
of
machinery
(inaudible),
unless
you
also
provide
at
least
the
time
of
machinery
for
taking
an
individual's
quote,
an
individual
expression
and
then
remember,
that
isn't
before
us,
how
can
a
secretary
make
such
an
avow,
that
nobody
belongs
to
an
organization
that
doesn't
advocate
the
overthrow
to
"other
unlawful
means,"
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
prepared
now
to
tell
us
with
explicitness
what
other
unlawful
means
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
boller
that
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
which
have
rejected
that
in
a
particular
situation
(inaudible)
that's
a
kind
of
a
limping
guide
what
statue
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
same
kind
of
unlawful
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
why
should
it
be
then
it
should
outlaw
people
who
advocate
overthrowing
the
government
of
the
united
states?
why
should
you
be
so
restricted
in
defining
the
means
of
(inaudible)
overthrow
the
government
in
washington?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
although
it
maybe
reasonable
that
when
it
comes
to
somebody
making
an
oath,
people
are
conscientious
are
making
an
oath,
presumably
one
must
assume
they
are
conscientious,
(inaudible)
advocates
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
the
doctrine
that
means
(inaudible)
and
commercial
corporations,
let
alone
the
secretary
of
a
church
finding
out
that
the
political
(inaudible)
or
the
members
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
trouble
is
that
a
church
body
isn't
precisely
the
same
as
an
individual,
that's
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
pretty
close,
isn't
it,
in
making
a
prophetic
statement
that
churches
won't
be
guilty
of
treason
(inaudible)
or
advocate
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
said
this
is
a
prophetic
statement,
that
is
undefined
future.
these
are
facts
will
not
be
guilty
of
treason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
boller
are
you
in
a
position
to
state
whether
(inaudible)
a
foreign
government
in
the
event
of
hostilities,
that's
so
hypothetical
and
so
(inaudible)
to
the
future,
it
is
to
unrelated
to
anything
(inaudible).
in
other
words
i'm
asking
whether
you're
prepared
to
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
if
you
(inaudible)
ruling
of
your
supreme
court,
the
statute
to
provide
that
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
court
says
that
part
of
the
constitution
is
out,
then
that
would
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
a
surplus
in
your
treasury,
you're
giving
away
a
lot
of
money.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
an
inducement
for
that
end?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that
the
state
can
promote
whatever
the
purposes
of
the
church
are
by
giving
it
a
natural
benefit,
that
isn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
(inaudible)--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
point
you
are
making?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
take
an
oath
about
some
other
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
just
said
in
the
record
doesn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
there
a
general
separability
clause
under
california
courts
comparable
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
strike
down
what
--
it
becomes
necessary
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
were
(inaudible)
of
those
who
did
spontaneously
or
without
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
from
the
what
you
call
the
registrar
or
the
official
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
merely
suggesting
that
(inaudible)
