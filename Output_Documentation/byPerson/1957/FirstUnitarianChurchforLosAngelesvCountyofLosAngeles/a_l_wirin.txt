mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
here
are
two
churches
in
southern
california
one
of
the
first
unitarian
church
of
los
angles,
the
other
is
the
valley
unitarian-universalist
church
of
san
fernando
valley.
the
petitioners
are
here
because
they
do
no
comply
with
the
requirement
of
a
statute
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
california
in
1953.
this
requirement
imposed
as
a
condition
for
securing
the
traditional
tax
exemption
which
so
far
as
churches
are
concerned
had
been
accorded
in
california
for
over
a
century
and
which
these
petitioners
had
had
dropped
their
existence.
in
the
event,
this
statute,
the
text
to
which
of
course
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
bringing
of
opening
brief,
imposed
as
a
condition
for
the
securing
of
that
exemption
that
the
person-organization
make
a
declaration
under
oath,
the
tax
person
did
not
advocate
the
destruction
of
the
government
of
california
or
of
any
state
by
force
or
violence
or
under
--
or
rather
unlawful
means,
a
phrase
not
unknown
to
this
court.
but
additionally
and
conjunctively
also
imposed
the
requirement
that
the
person
declare
that
he
or
the
organization
declare
does
not
advocate
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostility.
a
phrase
quite
new
to
this
court,
indeed
my
guess
is
that
no
justice
sitting
on
this
court
has
ever
had
to
deal
with
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
or
it's
application.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
they
are
incorporated
institutions.
the
first
unitarian
church
in
a
very
short
statement
which
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
which
appears
in
the
record
which
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
legislation
which
we
asked
the
court
to
invalidate
is
the
statute
which
the
legislature
adopted
in
1953,
which
statute
appears
in
the
appendix
of
our
agreeing
brief
in
appendix
a
--
appendix
a.
and
we
are
also
asking
the
court
to
invalidate.
i
must
say
to
your
honor,
we're
asking
you
to
invalidate
as
applied
to
this
petitioners
be
that
--
be
that
as
it
may,
a
provision
in
the
california
constitution
which
appears
at
the
bottom
of
exhibit
a
and
which
was
adopted
by
a
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
voters
of
california
in
1952.
that
appears
at
the
bottom
of
exhibit
a.
i
hasten
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
was
by
referendum
after
the
request
for
it
by
the
legislature.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
is.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
are.
and
i
shall
advert
to
them
in
a
moment
if
i
may
your
honor
as
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
they
are
printed
and
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
full
text
of
the
argument
or
statement
pro
and
con.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
is.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
it
doesn't
too
clear
how
it's
done
but
in
any
event
someone
who
presumably
is
a
spokesman
and
responsible
for
and
knows
the
proposal
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
--
the
registrar
of
voters.
it
is
the
state
--
it
is
the
decision
by
the
state
of
california.
and
these,
the
argument
for
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
registrar
of
voters
makes
the
decision.
if
there
were
a
great
conflict,
i
don't
know
how
we
would
resolve
it.
but
ordinarily
he
selects
a
person
or
organization
whom
he
considers
responsible.
in
this
instance,
it
was
a
member
of
the
legislature
who
spoke
for
it
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union
spoke
against
it.
and
it
was
printed
and
distributed
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
is
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
we
made
mentioned
of
some
of
the
pertinent
provisions
in
our
briefs
and
i
shall
do
so
in
my
oral
argument.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
afraid
we
filed
just
one,
we
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
pardon?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
--
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
not
at
all
and
they're
available
and
we
will
--
we
will
file
a
copy
for
each
of
the
documents.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
document
is
the
document
distributed
by
the
registrar
of
voters
to
all
voters
in
california
at
elections
and
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
amendment
which
i
have
just
mentioned
at
the
election
1952,
there
was
such
a
document
which
referred
to
numerous
propositions
and
referred
particularly
to
the
proposition
which
became
the
constitutional
amendment.
and
it
contains
arguments
on
either
side
by
a
representative
--
by
persons
representing
each
side.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
does.
i
shall
refer
to
it
in
my
oral
argument.
we
refer
to
it
in
our
briefs.
and
we
shall
see
to
it
that
there
are
enough
copies
filed
so
that
each
of
your
honors
may
have
it,
may
have
a
copy.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
presumably.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
presumably
so,
and
i
shall
so
assume
it.
but
i
hasten
to
add
to
your
honors,
that
so
far
as
the
thrust
of
my
oral
argument
is
concerned
and
the
thrust
of
our
briefs
is
concerned,
we
challenged
the
legislation
which
was
adopted
by
the
california
legislature
subsequent
to
the
constitutional
amendment.
and
may
i
mention
this
your
honor,
we
make
that
challenge
because
the
constitutional
amendment
which
is
adapted
made
no
provisions
for
and
made
no
reference
to
the
requirement
of
any
declarations
under
oath
by
anyone
in
california.
the
legislature
however,
despite
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
provision
made
no
such
provision,
in
its
purpose
to
implement
the
constitutional
amendment
it
required
an
elaborate
comprehensive
oath
taking
system
which
i
should
advert
to
as
i
move
along
and
as
i
say,
which
constitutes
the
major
thrust
of
our
challenge.
in
other
words
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
am
saying
that
the
translation
should
be
tried.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
precisely.
our
emphasis
being
upon
the
latter.
our
point
being
that
the
translation
which
the
california
legislature
made
violates
the
federal
constitutional
limitations.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
is
some
dispute
in
--
in
california
as
to
whether
it
was
self-executing.
for
the
purposes
of
my
position
here,
it
is
self-executing
and
your
honors
may
so
assume.
but,
our
objection
is
and
i
think
the
position
of
the
respondent
is
that
the
constitutional
amendment
is
self-executing.
but
our
position
is
that
the
constitutional
amendment
was
not
self-executed
or
executed
and
it's
not
being
executed
at
any
manner
except
through
the
requirement
of
a
note
as
required
by
the
legislature.
so
that
your
honors
have
before
you
a
legislative
requirement
or
requiring
those
which
said
legislative
requirements
we
are
challenging
and
for
failure
of
compliance
with
legislative
requirements,
these
petitioners
lost
their
tax
exemption.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
might
be,
might
be.
your
honors,
it
might
very
well
say
that
all
you
need
to
reach
is
this
statute
because
in
order
to
vacate,
in
order
to
reverse
the
judgment
which
judgments
are
posited
upon
a
refusal
of
the
petitioners
to
take
this
loyalty
oath,
that
is
all
there
is
before
your
honors.
and
your
honors
may
go
further
and
your
honors
may
say,
since
the
language
in
the
--
well,
there's
no
point
in
my
urging
which
you
want
to
deem
go
further.
if
your
honors
will
go
far
enough
if
you
dispose
of
the
justiciable
controversy
raised
directly
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
or
of
the
major
and
immediate
justiciable
controversy,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
right
(voice
overlap)
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
pardon?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
they
can
be
filed
the
next
two
days.
i
can
phone
my
office
to
see
that
they
get
here.
i'm
pretty
sure.
and
make
it
the
cooperation
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
i
make
it
get
the
cooperation
of
the
respondent
that
represents
the
county
assessor
and
whom
must
have
hundreds
of
these
mailed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
very
well.
now,
the
petitioner
here
in
its
protest
to
the
assessor
objecting
to
being
required
to
comply
with
this
law
stated
and
it
is
at
the
record
14
and
it
is
a
short
paragraph,
and
i
think
--
i
can
--
i'm
sure
i
can
call
your
honors
attention
before
the
noon
--
before
the
hour
for
adjournment.
it
is
the
first
paragraph
on
page
14.
and
it
recites
in
the
word,
in
the
record
that
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
well.
the
first
unitarian
church
record,
i
shall
not
be
referring
to
the
other
record.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
the
thicker
--
the
thicker
of
the
two.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
382.
the
principles,
moral,
and
religious
of
the
first
unitarian
church
of
los
angeles
compel
it,
it's
members,
officers,
and
minister,
as
a
matter
of
deepest
conscience,
belief
and
conviction,
to
deny
power
in
the
state
to
compel
acceptance
by
it
or
any
other
church
of
this
or
any
other
oath
of
coerced
affirmation
as
to
church
doctrine,
advocacy
or
beliefs.
and
pursuant
to
this
protest,
the
petitioner
did
not
sign
the
declaration
under
oath
and
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
we
are
challenging
--
forfeited
its
right
to
tax
exemption.
and
then
in
accordance
with
california
procedure,
it
paid
the
tax
under
protest
and
filed
a
suit
to
recover
it.
in
the
courts
below,
there
are
--
were
two
cases,
the
valley
unitarian-universalist
in
this
case.
the
trial
judges
in
the
los
angeles
superior
court
divided
evenly,
one
judge
holding
this
requirement
invalid
under
state
law,
the
other
holding
is
valid.
and
when
we
reached
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
the
supreme
court
divided
4-to-3,
three
of
the
justices
believing
this
matter
to
be
violative
of
federal
constitutional
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
of
the
court
is
at
page
35,
the
dissents
are
at
page
57.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
indeed,
and
so
i
proceed
to
do
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
are
raising
questions
of
equal
protection
in
our
briefs.
i
have
been
taking
about
the
thrust
of
my
oral
argument.
your
honors
need
not
reach
the
problem
of
equal
protection
if
you
are
--
if
you
agree
favorably
to
the
petitioners
on
the
narrower
of
issue
of
due
process,
so
let
me
proceed
to
address
myself
to
that
problem.
i
say
to
your
honors
first
quickly
and
then
i
hope
to
demonstrate
it,
that
there
is
no
substantive
base,
there
is
no
support
in
any
real
evil,
or
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court,
there
is
no
solid
threat
to
any
security
in
california
warranting
this
legislation.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
your
honor
i
must
say
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
the
narrow
point
is
that
i'm
arguing
a
due
process
point
essentially
as
distinguished
from
the
broader
points
of
equal
protection
or
even
the
broader
point
of
religious
liberty
that
i
shall
mention
it,
or
even
the
broader
point
of
freedom
of
speech.
i
thought
that
due
process
is
a
comparatively
narrow
approach
before
this
court.
may
i
proceed
your
honor
to
develop
it?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
intent
to
your
honor,
but
--
i
intend
to.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
intend
to
--
i
hope
that
my
argument
before
it
is
concluded
will
impress
your
honor
as
a
narrow
nonetheless,
so
i
shall
proceed.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
and
that
no
claim
can
be
made
by
the
respondent
of
any
solid
threat
to
the
security
of
the
nation
or
to
security
of
california,
which
would
support
this
kind
of
legislation.
the
first
question
to
ask
is,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
and
here
i
shall
advert
to
the
arguments
for
the
constitutional
amendment
and
we
shall
see
to
it
at
these
are
filed
within
24
or
more
hours
from
now
in
sufficient
quantities
for
the
justices
of
the
court,
in
urging
the
support
of
a
proposal
which
became
the
constitutional
amendment,
it
was
urged,
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
such
exemptions
should
be
allowed
communists
and
the
like.
so
far
as
the
voters
of
california
was
concerned,
this
--
the
constitutional
amendment
was
designed
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
communists
and
the
like.
this
contention
or
this
position
is
supported
by
the
majority
of
the
court
below
which
in
the
record
at
page
52
explained
this
legislation
and
these
provisions
and
said
this
was
california's,
and
i
quote
"endeavor
to
protect
itself
from
subversive
infiltration."
now
of
course
i
suppose
when
a
court
or
a
person
these
days
talks
about
subversive
infiltration
he's
talking
about
the
infiltration
of
communists.
now
i
say
to
your
honors
that
there
are
no
facts,
supporting
the
assumption
that
communists
have
infiltrated
into
the
institutions
of
california
that
are
entitled
to
tax
exemption,
and
that
this
is
not
only
not
posit
on
fact
but
is
pure
fancy.
in
the
argument
to
the
voters
your
honors,
no
claim
was
made
that
there
were
any
communists
who
had
infiltrated
into
the
various
institutions
that
under
california
law
are
entitled
to
exemption
as
for
example
charitable
organizations,
churches
or
cemetery.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
veterans
are
also
entitled
to
exemptions
and
i
should
--
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
that.
there
is
no
claim
so
far
as
the
argument
is
concerned
that
any
of
the
agencies
or
persons
that
are
entitled
in
the
california
law
have
been
subject
to
infiltration
for
communist,
as
far
as
any
of
them
are
concerned.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
list
is
brought,
there
are
many
other
persons
entitled
to
exemption
one
of
them
is
veterans
and
other
are
veterans
of
growing
crops,
householders
are
entitled
to
exemption,
income
tax
payers
are
entitled
to
some
exemption.
now
--
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
no
claim
in
the
argument
that
any
of
the
persons
or
organizations,
no
matter
how
many
they
maybe
that
are
entitled
to
tax
exemptions
had
been
victimized
or
subjected
to
infiltration
by
communists.
on
the
contrary,
no
such
claim
was
made
in
the
legislature
which
adopted
this
legislation.
no
single
judge
in
any
of
the
proceedings
in
the
california
courts
suggested
that
there
was
any
basis
for
any
such
claim.
on
the
contrary,
the
dissenters
of
the
court
affirmatively
stated
and
i
refer
to
the
record
at
page
60,
there
is
no
evidence
that
plaintiff
church
or
any
of
the
organizations
seeking
tax
exemption,
this
is
the
second
new
paragraph,
and
the
second
sentence
in
the
second
new
paragraph
on
page
60,
there
is
no
evidence
that
plaintiff
church
or
any
of
the
organizations
seeking
tax
exemptions
are
infiltrated
by
communists
or
other
disloyal
persons
or
that
they
are
in
any
danger
of
such
infiltration,
the
evidence
is
all
to
the
contrary.
this
solemn
statement
by
three
of
the
seven
justices
was
not
disputed
again
say
by
the
majority
of
the
court,
on
the
contrary
in
the
record
at
56,
the
majority
of
the
court
implicitly
accepts
this
statement
and
appraisal
after
it
--
page
56
after
the
majority
of
the
court
recognizes
the
integrity
and
the
morality
of
the
principles
of
the
petitioners.
it
goes
on
to
say,
i'm
reading
from
the
first
new
paragraph,
the
sentence
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
organization
actuated
by
the
doctrine
of
pronouncements
there
declared,
namely
by
the
unitarians
would
knowingly
harbor
within
itself
any
person
or
group
of
persons
who
would
engage
in
the
subversive
activities
referred
to.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honors,
nowhere
throughout
the
proceedings
in
the
courts
below
and
not
even
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
has
there
been
any
suggestion
that
this
legislation
is
needed,
because
of
any
claim
that
communists
had
infiltrated
institutions
that
are
ordinarily
entitled
to
tax
exemptions
as
the
basis
for
support
of
this
legislation.
indeed
the
california
legislature
made
no
findings
at
any
time
of
any
danger
to
the
institutions
from
communists
and
this
is
in
marked
contradistinction
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
when
california
legislature
was
dealing
with
the
problem
of
subversives
in
education,
public
education
and
in
government,
it
affirmatively
made
elaborate
findings
with
respect
to
such
infiltration
and
such
dangers,
similar
to
the
findings
made
by
the
legislature
of
new
york
in
the
case
which
was
before
this
court
in
adler.
this
case
does
not
have
findings
by
the
legislature
comparable
to
the
findings
or
comments
made
by
committees
of
the
congress
with
respect
to
the
old
declaration
which
was
involved
in
the
douds
case.
and
the
reason
no
findings
were
made
and
no
suggestions
that
this
danger
exists
in
california
is
because
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
for
such
a
claim,
because
this
claim
is
pure
fancy.
now
i
have
talked
thus
far
solely
with
respect
to
the
first
half
of
the
requirement
which
every
tax
payer
must
avow
about.
there
are
two
halves,
and
they
are
in
the
conjunctive
and
no
one
may
receive
a
tax
exemption
in
california,
unless
he
otherwise
is
entitled
to
it,
unless
he
or
the
organization
involved
avows
in
the
conjunctive
or
avows
negatively
in
the
disjunctive
that
the
person
or
organization
advocates
--
it
doesn't
advocate
the
destruction
of
government
by
violence
and
so
forth,
nor
advocates
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
isn't
clear,
in
this
instance
the
oath
was
taken
by
an
officer
of
a
corporate
body
of
the
unitarian
church.
since
it's
a
corporation
presumably
an
officer
of
the
corporation
could
do
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
in
this
particular
instance
the
church,
the
unitarian
church
being
a
congregational
group
and
being
subject
to
democratic
procedures
there
was
a
vote
by
the
congregation
and
then
the
church
through
an
officer
made
its
protest
and
indicated
it
was
unwilling
to
take
the
oath.
now
i
turn
to
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
is
none.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
is
no
provision
of
law,
what
the
churches
have
done
is
for
some
official
of
the
church,
of
the
church
body
to
--
church
that
had
signed,
had
done
so
through
an
official
of
the
church
body,
the
churches
that
have
not
signed
had
made
their
protest
through
an
officer
of
the
church
body.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
may
i
answer
that
a
little
bit
later
or
i
may
--
i
intend
to
and
i
certainly
shall.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
think
it
is
and
i'll
try
to
give
your
honor
some
figures
in
a
moment.
i
however
want
to
say
a
word
now
with
respect
to
the
second
half
of
the
requirement,
the
one
pertaining
to
support
hostilities
and
so
on.
now
in
the
first
page
your
honors
will
note
that
in
this
provision
there
is
nothing
about
the
state
of
california.
this
deals
with
the
problem
of
foreign
relations
and
what
maybe
advocated
in
california
as
a
condition
of
getting
tax
exemption
in
peace
time
in
the
event
of
hostility,
but
passing
that,
here
is
a
provision,
new
in
the
statute
books,
throughout
the
current
cold
war,
which
we
hope
is
not
as
cold
as
it
was
some
years
ago,
no
other
state
in
the
union
saw
the
need
of
adopting
any
such
provision.
now
here
again
there
are
no
findings
by
the
california
legislature,
there
is
no
suggestion
by
any
judge
in
california,
there
is
no
claim
by
our
opponents
that
this
legislation
has
support
in
the
actual
advocacy
by
churches,
by
anyone
in
california
anywhere
during
the
last
decade
or
more
or
ever
in
the
history
of
california
since
we
became
a
state
in
the
union,
there
is
no
suggestion,
the
natural
fact
any
person
in
california
has
actually
advocated
the
doctrine
which
is
set
forth
in
this
legislation.
i
have
called
it
a
peacetime
sedition
statute,
that's
what
it
is.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
seen
no
need
of
adopting
legislation
comparable
to
this
so
long
as
we
are
at
peace.
despite
the
numerous
and
thorough
going
investigations
conducted
by
congressional
committees
and
federal
executive
agencies,
no
one
has
suggested
that
anywhere
in
united
states
is
there
any
danger
from
persons
or
organizations
with
the
churches
or
otherwise
preaching
this
doctrine
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
second
half.
now
i'm
making
that
argument
merely
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
again
that
certainly
with
respect
to
this
completely
novel
provision,
californians
were
seeing
things
which
no
one
else
in
the
nation
saw.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
would
not
be,
and
we
are
proud
of
some
of
our
pioneering,
but
not
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
am
spending
time
about
the
newness
of
the
statute,
in
order
to
make
the
argument
that
there
is
no
real
warrant
for
it
and
in
order
to
make
the
point
which
i
shall
do
so
now,
that
while
this
court
has
had
before
it,
requirements
involving
avowals
or
belief
or
of
advocacy,
that's
for
instance
is
the
douds
case.
this
court
supported
the
requirement
of
the
douds
case
because
this
court
found
that
here
were
present
excesses
from
direct
active
conduct
based
upon
findings
or
statements
by
the
congress
that
communists
had
infiltrated
trade
unions
and
were
constituting
an
immediate
and
serious
menace
to
the
security
of
the
nation.
and
i'm
making
the
argument
your
honor
because
i
think
prominent
inference
can
be
drawn
by
this
court,
that
whether
new
or
old,
this
legislation
has
no
reasons
which
are
exigent
or
obviously
compelling
to
warrant
its
constitutional
support.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
certainly
can
say
that
it's
a
new
type
of
statute
so
far
as
the
requirement
of
an
oath
pertaining
to
non-advocacy
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
do
say
your
honor
that
so
far
as
the
requirement
of
a
note
is
concerned
of
disavowal
of
advocacy,
there
has
never
been
in
the
history
of
this
nation
any
such
requirement.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
it's
a
new
type
of
oath.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
mean
essentially
in
this
country,
i
am
not
too
conversant
with
the
type
of
oaths
required
in
hitler's
germany
and
i'm
sure
none
of
us
would
be
proud
of
them.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
i
understand
your
honor's
point,
and
i
may
make
reference
to
it.
i
was
referring
to
this
country
your
honor,
and
in
this
country,
to
my
knowledge
certainly
in
recent
years,
no
such
oath
was
required.
now
it
is
true
and
we
refer
to
it
in
our
brief
particularly
in
an
appendix
in
our
brief
that
this
type
of
oath
was
not
unknown
in
great
britain.
and
that
the
classic
test
oath
although
essentially
dealing
with
other
problems
and
dealing
essentially
with
religious
problems
rather
than
with
political
ones,
your
honor's
will
find
in
the
second
appendix
to
our
brief,
appendix
b
a
reference
to
some
of
the
classic
oaths
in
great
britain,
particularly
the
jacobean
oath,
which
had
provisions
with
respect
to
the
use
or
advocacy
--
the
use
of
violence,
which
had
provisions
pertaining
to
support
all
the
foreign
power
and
--
by
the
(inaudible)
was
concerned
referring
to
the
pope.
your
honor
will
find
those
references
particularly
on
page
8
and
page
9,
page
6
and
8
and
9
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor,
that
is
not
quite
my
point
because
i
don't
think
in
this
country
we
ever
adopted
the
worst
of
the
test
oath
in
great
britain,
so
my
point
is
that
it
never
belong
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
now
if
there
is
substance
to
my
argument
that
in
california
there
is
no
support,
no
solid
support
for
this
legislation,
i
move
on
to
the
second
half
of
my
argument
that
the
method
which
the
legislature
of
california
resorted
to
in
dealing
with
any
problem,
assuming
a
problem
really
existed,
is
so
sweeping
in
its
effect
as
to
become
unconstitutional
under
narrow
due
process
requirement.
let
us
look
for
a
moment
though
i
had
said
that
major
thrust
of
my
argument
will
be
with
respect
to
the
legislation.
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
the
constitutional
amendment
itself.
so
far
as
that
amendment
is
concerned
in
practice
in
california,
it
applies
to
every
--
to
virtually
every
adult
person
in
california
because
every
adult
person
in
california,
they
indicated
in
their
answer
to
mr.
justice
brendan
is
entitled
to
some
kind
of
an
exemption
whether
by
way
of
the
income
tax
or
householder.
and
therefore
so
far
as
the
constitutional
amendment
is
concerned,
it
applies
to
--
well
the
population
of
california
is
something
like
14
million,
if
we
talk
only
about
the
adult
population,
it
applies
perhaps
to
some
10
million.
so
far
as
the
faith
of
the
requirement
is
concerned,
it
is
the
most
sweeping,
that
any
i
know
of,
but
when
we
turn
to
the
legislation,
which
requires
oaths
the
number
of
course
becomes
considerably
less.
we've
indicated
that
the
figures
with
respect
to
those
who
are
subjected
to
this
oath
requirement
in
california
include
certainly
over
a
million
persons
in
california,
for
there
are
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
over
a
million
veterans
in
california,
who
actually
have
secured
exemption
who
have
submitted
to
this
oath.
and
the
figures
further
indicate
there
are
a
11000
churches
in
california,
there
are
more
than
11000
churches
in
california,
but
11000
churches
have
subscribed
to
this
oath,
i
shall
make
some
explanation
about
that
perhaps
later.
so
you
have
it
here
a
requirement,
which
so
far
as
the
constitutional
amendment
is
concerned
blankets
the
entire
state
and
so
far
as
the
legislation
is
concerned
involves
a
very
substantial,
a
very
large
number.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
it
does.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
every,
every,
every
person
except
householders
who
seek
an
exemption
have
to
take
this
oath.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
don't
think
we've
reached
that
point
yet
your
honor,
but
theoretically
any
person
who
has
an
income,
in
order
to
get
the
income
tax
exemption
would
have
to
subscribe
to
this
oath.
well
now
i
suggest
to
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
it
is
covered
in
our
brief.
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i'm
answering
in
this
way.
i
understand
that
the
sweep
of
a
regulation
particularly
one
that
involves
opinion,
that
involves
advocacy,
that
involves
conscience,
i
want
to
say
a
word
in
a
moment
or
two,
that
one
of
the
considerations
that
this
court
has
in
mind
in
balancing
the
need
of
national
security
on
the
one
hand
and
whether
the
legislation
is
reasonable
is
whether
it
were
narrowly
drawn
to
meet
a
particular
evil.
for
instance
in
the
douds
case,
your
honors
talked
about
a
hand
full
of
persons
who
were
affected,
your
honors
used
the
phrase,
"only
a
few
are
affected
by
this,"
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
where
a
regulation
is
sweeping
in
its
coverage
and
doesn't
affect
a
handful
or
a
few,
but
involves
more
than
a
million
persons,
it
is
one
of
the
considerations
your
honors
will
want
to
know
about.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
not
at
all.
your
honor
is
quite
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
but
i'm
in
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
veterans.
but
your
honor
i'm
including
for
the
churches
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor
is
quite
right,
that's
the
ultimate
question
for
your
honors
to
decide.
i'm
making
the
argument
that
in
arriving
at
that
ultimate
question,
you
may
take
into
consideration
the
general
sweep
of
this
regulation
as
to
what
those
offers
are
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
figures
which
i
gave
to
your
honor
of
a
million
veterans,
and
the
11000
churches
then
another
number
that
i
don't
know
apply
to
the
legislation.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
precisely.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
deals
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
my
understanding
is
but
i
may
have
to
view
to
my
opponent
for
--
to
give
the
court
enlightenment
that
those
who
pay
income
tax
and
those
who
make
any
declaration
seeking
any
exemption
are
also
required
to
sign
this
oath.
let
me
reserve
the
right
not
to
have
answered
your
question
as
i
certainly
haven't
with
a
view
of
either
answering
it
later
or
perhaps
my
colleague
can
help
me
out.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
true.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
the
figures
there
would
certainly
be
something
over
a
million
because
there
are
a
million
taxpayers
(inaudible).
now
let
me
address
myself
for
a
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
i
don't.
i
don't
think
that's
involved
here.
i
just
claim
that
once
tax
exemption
is
granted,
the
persons
who
receive
it
must
be
treated
fairly
without
imposing
any
unconstitutional
limitations
or
conditions.
and
that
the
requirement
here
is
such
an
unconstitutional
condition
or
limitation
because
it
involves
in
avow
with
respect
to
the
non-advocacy
by
the
church
and
that
leads
me
to
deal
with
the
narrow
question
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
let
me
spend
a
few
more
minutes
taking
about
the
particular
constitutional
problem
and
the
particular
position
of
the
petitioners
whom
i
represent.
now
they
take
the
position
that
as
churches,
they
have
had
the
right
from
time
immemorial
and
they
still
have
that
right,
free
from
coercion,
or
restraint,
or
prohibition,
or
inhibition
of
any
kind,
no
matter
how
direct
or
indirect,
no
matter
how
manifest
or
subtle
from
the
state
so
far
as
the
preaching
of
their
doctrines
are
concerned.
and
that
these
doctrines
include
particularly
the
right
of
churches
to
preach
to
their
followers
and
to
the
world,
the
commands
of
god
and
the
demands
of
morality.
and
that
requiring
churches
as
a
condition
of
securing
this
ancient
and
traditional
and
accredited
tax
exemption
recognized
by
every
state
in
the
union,
recognized
and
existing
in
california
for
over
a
century,
that
churches
must
be
free
not
to
preach
whatever
doctrine
they
may
want,
certainly
not
to
engage
in
any
conduct
they
may
want
without
accountability
to
seizure
but
free
from
accountability
to
the
state
of
california
and
to
seizure
prior
to
any
advocacy
as
to
what
their
principles
and
their
religious
doctrines
are.
the
churches
are
unwilling
and
unable
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
history
of
test
oaths
to
which
i
have
made
some
reference,
prior
to
advocacy
to
declare
in
advance
as
a
condition
of
getting
tax
exemption
as
to
what
doctrines
the
churches
will
not
advocate.
for
of
course
once
they
do
that,
they
can
readily
subject
themselves
to
accountability
to
the
state
for
the
doctrines
that
they
do
advocate.
now
i
don't
want
to
engage
now
in
a
long
discussion
about
the
metaphor
used
by
this
court
of
separation
of
church
and
state,
but
certainly
throughout
our
history,
this
court
has
acknowledged
that
there
are
many
situations
when
the
state
may
not
demand
of
a
person
or
of
an
institution
to
avow
prior
to
advocacy
pertaining
to
the
belief
or
the
advocacy
of
the
person
or
institution.
and
so
here
we
think
that
the
requirement,
particularly
the
oath
requirement
now,
violates
constitutional
limitation
because
the
effect
of
such
a
requirement
is
to
make
full
freedom
of
expression
on
matters
sacred
and
important
to
the
community,
a
little
bit
the
less
likely
if
churches
have
to
attest
to
their
non
advocacy
as
a
condition
of
securing
a
tax
exemption.
let
me
make
this
suggestion
to
the
court
as
i
sit
down
and
reserve
a
few
moments
for
reply.
on
page
6
of
our
reply
brief
in
the
appendix,
we
have
set
forth
a
statement
by
the
northern
california-nevada
council
of
churches
with
respect
to
this
requirement,
as
we
have
on
pages
just
previous
to
that
by
the
american
baptist
association,
the
methodist
discipline,
the
position
of
the
american
unitarian
association,
the
position
for
instance
on
page
3
of
some
600
protestant
ministers
who
are
in
the
southern
california
council
of
protestant
churches,
which
appears
for
instance
at
the
footnote
5
on
page
3.
and
finally
let
me
call
your
honors'
attention
because
i
think
it
demonstrates
the
point
that
i'm
urging,
to
the
language
of
the
northern
california-nevada
council
of
churches
representing
all
of
the
protestant
churches
in
northern
california
and
nevada,
i
won't
read
it
but
it
is
before
your
honors,
in
which
that
group
states
its
vigorous
castigation
and
opposition
to
communism,
to
marxian
communism,
but
nonetheless
protests
the
loyalty
oath
requirement
and
yet
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
most
of
our
churches
have
signed
this
oath
because
of
the
desperate
need
the
churches
have
for
the
funds
which
are
involved
in
a
tax
exemption.
now
i
say
to
your
honors
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
is
on
page
6
of
the
reply
brief
which
is
a
vanilla
colored
little
brief,
on
page
6
of
the
appendix
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
it
is
impossible
to
appraise
either
in
a
grocer's
scale
or
through
a
geiger
counter,
the
pulse
upon
the
freedom
of
expression
of
opinion
in
california
generally
and
particularly
in
the
pulpits
of
california
where
opinion
and
doctrine
must
be
free,
when
there
is
a
requirement
which
compels
churches
despite
opposition
to
attest
to
the
doctrines
which
they
do
not
advocate
as
a
condition
of
securing
tax
exemption.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
could.
i
don't
know
whether
they
could
from
all
churches,
i
think
they
could
from
all
persons,
i
doubt
whether
very
much
whether
it
could
discriminate
against
churches
in
the
grant
of
exemption
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
what
i
understand
the
question
to
be,
if
there
was
an
effort
to
discriminate
against
churches,
i
think
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
then
i
answer
your
question
--
your
honor's
questions
by
saying
that
it
could,
but
my
--
i
might
state
further
that
our
view
is
that
once
privilege,
a
gratuity,
like
a
right
--
like
a
public
employment
which
is
the
privilege
so
far
as
(inaudible)
is
granted
and
then
the
state
may
not
take
it
away
for
unreasonable
reasons
or
in
an
arbitrary
manner.
and
the
point
of
my
argument
is
that
to
require
a
statement
particularly
by
churches
of
non
advocacy
is
abusing
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
your
honor,
if
there
were
a
constitutional
amendment
which
provided
that
and
barred
churches
from
securing
exemption
if
they
advocated
such
conduct,
it
probably
would
be
good,
but
on
the
other
hand
i
would
say
if
it
requires
a
declaration
under
oath
on
the
part
of
churches,
in
view
of
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
church
and
state,
in
view
of
the
insistence
by
churches
not
to
be
subject
to
the
commands
of
seizure
prior
to
advocacy,
i
think
that
would
be
bad.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
say
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
i
would
think
that
one
of
the
considerations
that
may
determine
constitutionality
is
how
sweep
is
that
--
how
many
persons
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
my
own
answer
to
your
question
is
that
that
would
be
too
sweeping
and
too
offensive,
an
intrusion
into
the
opinions
of
the
people
of
california
to
warrant
any
real
danger
to
national
security.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
my
own
view
is
that
that
requirement
would
be
too
broad
but
i
further
hasten
to
suggest
to
your
honor
that
there
are
two
provisions
both
in
the
conjunctives
and
that
if
your
honors
were
to
agree
that
the
second
provision
is
invalid,
you
will
not
need
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
first
provision,
but
i
think
would
be
required
to
reverse
the
judgment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
do
make
some
distinction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
distinction
is
that
there
you
would
have
the
statute
which
narrowly
applies
to
expressions
of
opinions
which
are
incitements
and
hence
legitimately
run
afoul
of,
legitimately
run
afoul
law
whereas
here
you
have
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
your
honor
i
must
say
i
certainly
feel
that
legislation
which
california
adopts
must
be
based
on
the
some
real
existing
danger
rather
than
just
pure
fancy.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
your
honors
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honors
have
used
the
scales
all
the
time,
you
use
it
with
discretion
and
subtly
but
your
honor
has
participated
in
rulings
where
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
about
a
1000.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
first
to
answer
(inaudible)
idea
the
question
propounded
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
same
time
to
answer
a
question
not
put
to
me
but
that
arose
in
colloquy
by
justice
harlan.
the
three
dissenters
below
read
the
statute
as
not
drawing
a
distinction
between
incitement
and
advocacy
and
not
drawing
a
distinction
between
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine
and
advocacy
of
a
call
to
action.
your
honors
will
find
that
on
page
60
of
the
record,
page
60
the
middle
paragraph.
so
that
we
do
have
here
at
page
60
the
first
paragraph.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
at
least
the
dissenters
were
of
the
view
that
the
distinction
between
incitement
and
prophesy
does
not
appear
in
this
statute
and
therefore
this
statute
is
void
for
failing
to
draw
that
distinction.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
this
distinction
has
the
more
significance
but
what
is
involved
is
not
a
prosecution
for
advocacy
but
what
is
involved
the
failure
of
someone
to
take
an
oath
about
it
because
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
first
about
some
other
people
and
with
respect
to
that
what
are
involved
here
with
respect
to
the
two
churches,
a
congregation
of
the
churches,
they're
churches
that
have
no
dogma,
and
no
creed
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
church,
not
the
minister,
not
the
officer,
not
the
secretary
or
anyone
who
may
speak
for
either
for
the
church
or
for
any
of
the
members
or
for
all
of
the
members
with
respect
to
the
advocacy
either
of
the
church
or
of
any
one
of
them.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
a
very
excellent
brief
prepared
in
this
case
not
by
the
petitioners
but
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
(inaudible),
you
will
find
on
page
24
a
very
helpful
discussion
of
this
matter
with
respect
to
matter
that
you
may
take
judicial
notice.
on
page
24
of
the
civil
liberties
union
brief
and
may
i
hasten
to
remind
your
honor
that
in
the
(inaudible)
case
mr.
justice
frankfurter
you
said
the
--
that
the
court
was
greatly
helped
by
the
able
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
you
may
find
that
to
be
true
here
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
page
24.4
of
the
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
mr.
gunawal
who
prepared
it
with
your
counsel
at
your
desk.
now
finally
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
severability
both
the
constitutional
amendment
and
the
statutory
requirement
which
we
are
challenging
refer
to
the
two
kinds
of
advocacies
which
have
been
the
subject
of
discussion
and
colloquy.
the
statutory
requirement
is
even
more
clear
for
it
says
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
and
so
forth
--
excuse
me,
it
provides
that
one
must
attest
or
avow
with
respect
to
non-advocacy
of
these
two,
of
these
doctrines.
now
if
your
honors
were
to
find
the
doctrines
with
respect
to
support,
peace
time
support
in
the
event
of
hostilities
of
a)
to
a
foreign
government
as
against
the
united
states
to
be
vague.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor
it's
not
a
clairvoyant
but
you
say
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say
and
that
is
that
you
still
have
the
problem
of
unlawful
means
which
is
in
the
first
half
of
the
requirement
and
which
we
think
is
equally
vague
and
equally
vulnerable
certainly
so
far
as
requiring
someone
--
persons
of
good
conscious
and
there's
no
question
of
(inaudible)
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
think
not
but
we
would
hope
that
your
honors
would
not
--
i'm
going
to
(inaudible)
maybe
that's
too
strong,
we
would
hope
your
honors
would
not
try
to
rewrite
california
legislation,
we
would
assume
that
it
would
be
fair
to
(inaudible)
this
legislation,
and
if
california
wants
to
adopt
other
legislation,
thereafter
of
course
it
is
free
to
do
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
would
think
--
this
is
our
position.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
is
our
position.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
is
no
separability
clause
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
not,
not
at
all.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
because
--
because
your
honor
churches
simply
cannot
and
will
not
release
some
make
any
attestations
with
respect
to
their
advocacies
and
we
would
like
that
as
a
minimum
to
be
the
result
of
the
action
of
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
some
have
no
difficulty,
a
large
number
do
have
and
they're
entitled
to
protection
from
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
(inaudible)
your
honor,
i
gave
your
honors
a
reference
to
a
statement
by
a
northern
california
and
it's
on
page
6
but
they're
not
figures,
they're
not
figures.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
don't
know.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
as
far
as
we
know
they
did
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
do
i
have
the
figures,
we
have
the
statement
that
most
of
the
churches
of
california
sign
the
oath
under
protest
and
many
did
not,
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
to
your
honors
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
this
has
been
the
statement
of
the
northern
california
and
about
a
council
of
churches
which
appears
on
page
6.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
should
think
so,
but
that
--
i
should
think
so
but
here
many
did
not
sign.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
of
course
i
know.
