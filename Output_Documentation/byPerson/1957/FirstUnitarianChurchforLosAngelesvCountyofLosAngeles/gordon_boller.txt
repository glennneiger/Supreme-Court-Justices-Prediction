mr.
gordon
boller
if
your
honors
please,
may
i
run
back
over
a
little
of
the
introductory
legislative
and
constitutional
procedure
which
my
opponent
has
covered.
in
california,
constitutional
amendment
may
be
accomplished
in
one
of
two
ways.
the
constitution
maybe
amended
only
by
popular
vote,
state
wide
vote
of
the
people.
the
measure
to
accomplish
such
amendment
may
initiate
with
the
legislature
or
it
may
initiate
by
petition,
initiative
petition
signed
by
the
people.
the
measure
so
prepared
whether
by
the
legislature
or
by
initiative
petition,
is
by
the
secretary
of
state
submitted
to
the
people.
the
measure
is
entitled,
a
title
given
to
it
and
which
is
then
put
on
the
ballot
which
the
people
vote
on
by
the
legislative
counsel,
a
legal
advisory
body
set
up
with
that
as
one
of
its
duties.
upon
that
submission
the
vote
is
taken
and
the
amendment
becomes
effective
according
to
that
vote
as
of
the
date
of
the
election.
now
here
in
california
there's
a
provision
which
has
been
in
the
constitution
since
1900,
which
was
then
adopted
as
a
constitutional
amendment
article
13,
section
one-and-a-half,
this
is
the
so-called
church
exemption
provision.
it's
not
a
general
provision
for
exemption
of
church
property.
it
is
not
a
provision
at
all
exempting
church
property
as
such.
it's
an
exemption
of
property
by
reason
of
its
use,
an
exemption
of
property
used
solely
and
exclusively
for
religious
worship.
it
is
not
an
absolute
and
unconditional
exemption.
it
is
conditioned
on
such
use.
it
is
further
conditioned
on
the
property
not
being
rented
and
rent
received
for
the
use
by
the
owner.
now
this
constitutional
amendment
of
property
used
for
religious
worship
continued
in
that
form
with
minor
extensions
until
1952,
the
exemption
of
property
as
used
for
religious
worship
was
extended
to
cover
property
which
was
intended
for
such
use
that
is
property
which
was
in
the
course
of
construction.
it
was
extended
to
include
as
well
as
the
building
and
the
land
whereon
situate
equipment
of
the
church.
it
was
extended
as
well
to
include
parking
areas
and
parking
lots,
but
that
exemption
of
church
property,
not
under
that
category
but
exemption
of
property
used
solely
and
exclusively
for
religious
worship
continued
until
1952
when
one
of
the
measures
called
in
question
here
was
adopted
by
popular
vote.
the
people
in
1952
by
statewide
election
adopted
the
constitutional
provision
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
constitution,
no
person
or
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means,
or
who
advocates
the
support
of
the
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities
shall
receive
exemption
from
any
tax
imposed
by
this
state
or
any
county,
city
or
county,
district
and
so
forth.
the
legislature
shall
enact
such
laws
as
maybe
necessary
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
this
section.
at
the
next
session
in
the
1953
session
of
the
--
mr.
gordon
boller
they
are
not.
the
vote
was
over
two
to
one
in
favor
of
the
adoption
of
that
constitutional
amendment.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
was
some
four
million
--
two
million,
hundred
and
nine
thousand
something
for
and
a
million
something
of
the
less
than
half
against.
the
figures
are
not
in
the
record
i
think.
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
a
matter
of
public
record,
i
ascertained
it,
i
think
i
have
a
note
of
it,
i
think
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it
would
not
make
a
bit
of
difference,
so
far
as
the
validity.
i
can
give
you
those
figures
your
honor,
you're
asking
them
yes,
the
yes
vote
was
2,902,695.
the
no
vote
was
1,359,970.
at
the
next
session
of
the
legislature,
the
legislature
utilized
the
authority
given
to
it
and
adopted
as
a
provision
of
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
section
32,
any
statement
written
or
other
document
in
which
is
claimed
any
exemption
other
than
the
householders'
exemption
from
any
property
tax
imposed
by
this
state
county
and
so
forth
shall
contain
a
declaration
that
the
person
or
organization
making
the
statement,
return,
or
other
document
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
state
of
california
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means
nor
advocate
the
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities.
if
any
such
statement
returned
or
other
document
does
not
contain
such
declaration,
the
person
or
organization
making
such
statement
return
or
other
document
shall
not
receive
any
exemption
from
the
tax
to
which
the
statement
return
or
other
document
pertains.
this
legislation
is
with
regard
to
the
property
taxes
--
mr.
gordon
boller
there
is
not,
and
the
income
tax
form
i
signed
one
within
the
month,
it
does
contain
any
declaration
of
this
sort.
it
has
been
applied
only
to
the
property
tax
situation.
mr.
gordon
boller
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
the
veteran
--
the
exemptions
are
setup
in
the
constitution,
there
is
an
exemption
of
the
property
of
colleges,
the
property
of
veterans,
the
property
of
welfare
organizations.
they
are
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
think
he
did.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
think
he
did.
now,
there
is
inherent
right
to
tax
exemption.
tax
exemption
constitutes
a
benefit
accorded
to
some
that
is
not
accorded
to
others,
this
is
a
special
privilege.
it
constitutes
unequal
treatment.
it's
a
benefit
in
favor
to
the
party
receiving
the
exemption.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
think
so.
all
exemption
involves
that
situation.
if
you
tax
one
and
do
not
tax
another,
it
is
unequal
treatment.
mr.
gordon
boller
no,
you
would
exempt
the
one
who
signed
to
the
full
and
you
would
tax
the
one
who
did
not
sign.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
that's
right
and
the
question
is
for
your
honors
whether
this
is
a
valid
classification,
and
we
submit
that
it
is.
now,
i've
just
said
that
exemption
from
taxation
constitutes
unequal
treatment,
a
benefit
and
a
favor
to
some
and
what
is
the
justification
for
that
unequal
treatment?
exemptions
are
granted
by
the
public,
commonly
granted
found
throughout
the
country.
tax
exemptions
are
justified
on
the
ground
of
some
compensating
benefit
to
the
public
body
which
is
granting
it,
which
compensates
for
the
loss
of
the
revenue
which
would
otherwise
be
received.
the
exemptions,
for
example
the
exemption
to
religious
organizations,
and
that's
what
we're
concerned
with
here,
is
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
teachings
and
influences
of
religion
make
better
citizens,
and
that
the
churches
and
it's
activities
renders
a
benefit
to
the
state
and
to
the
general
public,
whereby
the
state
gets
back
in
the
benefit
from
personal
conduct
and
private
and
public
morality
what
it
looses
in
money.
people
perform
public
services
that
they
otherwise
would
not
perform,
and
refrain
from
public
misconduct,
that
they
otherwise
would
not
refrain
from.
the
benefit
is
expected
to
be
found
in
the
church's
influence
and
work,
and
the
result
thereof
in
maintaining
and
raising
the
standards
of
civic
and
private
virtue
and
the
ideals
and
conduct
in
public
and
in
private
life.
if
however
the
influence
of
the
exemption
recipient
is
inamicable
to
such
results,
and
if
it
fails
to
forward
such
purpose,
the
justification
for
the
exemption
is
gone
and
the
exemption
should
be
and
may
validly
be
withheld
or
withdrawn.
mr.
gordon
boller
there
will
be
a
discouragement
to
that
institution
of
engaging
in
such
activities,
and
the
result
of
such
discouragement
should
be
a
lessening
of
that
activity
which
is
of
injury
to
the
public
and
to
the
common
good.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
activity
--
there
are
two
specified
advocacies,
we
are
not
talking
--
mr.
gordon
boller
there
is
no
evidence
your
honor,
and
i
want
to
--
mr.
gordon
boller
the
activities
of
the
two
specified
advocacies,
the
constitution
and
the
statute
both
attempt
to
discourage
the
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means,
the
advocacy
of
support
of
a
foreign
government
against
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
hostilities.
those
are
two
advocacies
which
constitution
and
statute
both
oppose.
now
the
organization
which
advocates
as
an
inamicable,
unfortunate,
antisocial
effect
upon
the
community
in
which
it
operates
--
mr.
gordon
boller
that
is
right,
to
discourage
it,
to
keep
it
to
the
minimum,
to
eliminate
it
if
possible.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
well
discourage
the
activity.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
does,
and
that
is
not
in
issue
in
the
case
your
honor.
that
is
to
say
on
the
record
here,
there
is
no
allegation
that
these
petitioners
do
not
advocate
the
forbidden
types
of
advocacy.
mr.
gordon
boller
your
honor
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
the
issue
is
narrowly
drawn
as
to
the
validity
of
this
constitutional
and
this
statutory
measure.
the
allegations
of
the
complaints
in
each
of
the
cases
--
mr.
gordon
boller
the
people
with
the
proposition
before
them
appreciated
the
possibility
of
a
situation
as
to
every
claimant
of
tax
exemption,
as
to
any
claimant
of
tax
exemption,
and
made
the
--
and
adopted
the
provision
broadly,
that
anyone
advocating
the
two
proscribed
types
of
advocacy
should
not
receive
--
mr.
gordon
boller
--
the
gratuity
and
benefit.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
--
it
seems
your
honor
that
the
situation
was
self
evident
to
the
people
without
a
taking
of
a
poll
on
it,
without
the
need
of
getting
data
on
it.
they
were
acting
in
a
situation
in
which
they
lived
and
which
going
to
polls
they
elected
to
move
with
regard
to
--
they
conceived
that
the
effect
would
be
to
heighten
the
moral
influence
in
the
community
and
better
the
behavior
of
exemption
recipients.
that
it
would
diminish
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it
was
advocacy
of
the
type
which
they
were
voting
on
and
which
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes,
it's
common
knowledge
--
mr.
gordon
boller
there
is
no
evidence.
i
was
starting
to
say
that
the
issue
is
not
raised
in
the
record
for
just
the
reason
that
the
complaint
was
narrowly
drawn
to
take
objection
to
the
validity
of
the
constitutional
provision
in
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
came
up
on
demurrer
then.
there
was
no
possibility
of
showing.
there
was
no
possibility
of
finding,
because
naturally
there
was
no
possibility
of
evidence.
the
question
rose
as
a
question
of
law
on
demurrer
to
the
petitions
in
the
two
cases.
and
the
question
before
your
honors
is
the
question
as
to
the
validity,
a
constitutional
and
statutory
provision
of
the
sort
of
this
--
of
these
specific
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
would,
it
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it
would
raise
an
essentially
different
question
your
honor.
that
would
go
to
the
question,
the
religious
freedom
question,
the
freedom
of
belief
and
opinion.
what
is
aimed
at
here
is
no
infringement
on
belief
or
opinion
but
on
action,
advocating
the
overthrow
of
government.
your
honors
have
the
distinction
well
in
mind
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
oh,
advocate
the
overthrow.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
advocate
--
i
take
in
this
use
here
means
action,
incitement
just
as
--
mr.
gordon
boller
--
as
in
the
dennis
case
and
the
yates
case,
the
distinction
which
your
honors
have
in
mind
between
incitement
and
action
and
mere
holding
of
opinion
or
belief.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
that's
the
way
we
do
construe
it,
yes,
yes.
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
construction
which
is
justified
that
is
the
interpretation
which
was
put
up
on
it
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
oath?
mr.
gordon
boller
yes,
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
oath,
i
don't
know
that
the
--
it
is
not
in
our
record
as
taken
as
quoting
the
affidavit
attached
to
the
application
for
exemption,
but
--
mr.
gordon
boller
but
i'm
telling
you,
but
i'm
telling
you
yes.
i'm
telling
your
honor
yes.
the
language
of
the
oath
follows
precisely.
mr.
gordon
boller
oh
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
affiant
would
be
the
secretary,
the
president
or
some
other
officer
of
the
corporation.
mr.
gordon
boller
he
would
swear
that
the
applicant
for
exemption,
claim
being
made
in
the
name
of
the
church
that
the
applicant
for
exemption
did
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force,
violence
or
other
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
a
large
--
it's
a
large
organization.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
don't
know
mr.
wirin
can
tell
you.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
as
wirin
stated
in
his
operating
argument
a
vote
was
taken,
the
ajority
was
in
favor
of
declining
to
make
the
affidavit.
mr.
gordon
boller
and
then,
and
then
i
take
it
the
officer
who
applied
for
exemption
in
behalf
of
the
church
represented
them
in
making
the
signature.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
didn't
believe,
it's
what
they
do.
mr.
gordon
boller
well,
they
have
indicated
to
him
their
attitude
as
to
the
oath
certainly
--
mr.
gordon
boller
--
as
to
what
his,
as
to
what
his
signature
on
the
application,
on
the
exemption
application
shall
be
--
mr.
gordon
boller
not
it
was
--
mr.
gordon
boller
well
--
in
the
first
place
i
don't
go
with
your
honor
on
the
suggestion
that
it's
coerced,
it's
a
free
choice.
mr.
gordon
boller
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
in
election
and
it's
election
under
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
all
right,
that's
--
i
can
concede
entirely
your
honors
suggestion
that
a
right
may
not
be
denied
on
an
unconstitutional
condition.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
his
affidavit
which
he
is
making
for
the
purpose
of
getting
exemption
is
with
regard
to
church
activity
not
with
regard
to
individuals,
the
1000s
action.
and
i
--
mr.
gordon
boller
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
the
individuals,
i
think
it's
the
corporate
action,
the
action
of
the
institution
and
--
mr.
gordon
boller
what
this
church
officially
believes
in
and
stands
for
as
implemented
in
its
action.
mr.
gordon
boller
well,
it
was
the
action
which
was
taken
here
as
to
what
should
be
the
or
the
corporate
action
with
regard
to
--
mr.
gordon
boller
not
to
get
litigation
but
to
get
our
--
not
to
get
an
exemption
benefit,
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
well
--
mr.
gordon
boller
they
had
no
difficulty
in
making
affidavit
and
swearing
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
exemption
that
their
property
was
used
solely
and
exclusively
for
religious
worship,
the
--
mr.
gordon
boller
they
make
affidavit
in
order
to
claim,
the
claim
for
exemption
must
be
under
oath.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
statute
constitutes,
the
statue
requires
a
declaration.
mr.
gordon
boller
that
the
party
claiming
the
exemption
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
yes
or
the
support
of
the
foreign
government.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
does
not.
they
have
indicated
by
their
vote,
what
they
wish
to
be
either
corporate
action
as
to
the
claim
of
exemption.
mr.
gordon
boller
and
(inaudible)
your
honors'
questions
to
me,
we
have
here
a
condition
which
was
imposed
by
the
legislature
in
implementing
a
statute
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
the
right.
we
already
have
the
condition
recognized
and
utilized
that
claim
must
be
made.
this
is
another
condition
which
must
be
met.
the
provision
long
recognized
has
been
that
the
claim
for
exemption
if
not
made
was
waived.
statute
has
provided
that
any
party
entitled
to
exemption,
must
make
his
claim
therefore
or
if
he
failed
to
make
it,
that
the
exemption
is
waived.
that
is
a
condition
which
was
validly
imposed.
as
to
the
veteran
there
is
the
requirement
as
well
that
he
make
the
exemption.
that
is
the
ordinary
type
of
an
implementing
statute.
now
the
state
has
recognized,
the
state
of
california
has
recognized
and
declared
valid
implementing
statues
of
this
sort.
the
statute
i've
spoken
of
it
requiring
the
veteran
to
claim
his
constitutional
exemption
under
penalty
of
forfeiture
for
one
of
the
claim,
when
the
--
that
was
the
case
of
chesney
against
byram.
the
veteran
failed
to
claim
the
exemption,
he
came
to
court
and
said
the
constitution
gave
me
exemption,
the
legislature
came
along
and
said
i
must
claim
the
exemption
or
i
forfeited,
and
the
court
said
that's
all
right,
that's
an
implementing
statute.
the
constitution
provides
that
public
property
shall
not
be
taken
or
damaged
for
public
use
without
compensation
first
provided.
along
came
the
legislature
and
said
in
such
a
situation,
claim
on
account
of
such
taking
or
injury
must
be
made
within
a
year
or
the
right
is
gone.
that
was
an
implementing
statute.
it
was
not
contrary
to
the
provision
of
grant
by
the
constitution
and
it
was
upheld,
(inaudible)
and
so
forth
against
the
city
of
los
angeles.
the
constitutional
provision
assured
the
right.
the
legislative
provision
declared
that
unless
certain
procedure
was
followed,
the
right
could
not
be
asserted.
constitution
assures
the
electoral
franchise.
mr.
gordon
boller
they
do
and
supposedly
the
action
of
the
organization,
the
corporation
will
be
that
indicated
by
the
majority
thereof.
mr.
gordon
boller
depending
upon,
as
your
honor
is
pointing
out
what
the
character
of
the
organization
is
and
its
character
determined
by
its
majority
membership.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
no.
mr.
gordon
boller
he
would
be
--
he
is
entitled
to
say
he
believes.
what
the
constitution
--
mr.
gordon
boller
he
didn't
--
mr.
gordon
boller
there
is
no
difference
--
that
wouldn't
involve
the
advocacy
of
overthrow
by
force
and
violence,
he
is
stating
--
mr.
gordon
boller
still
it
wouldn't
be
a
false
oath,
because
he
is
the
individual
there
is
the
exception
and
--
exceptional
individual
and
he
is
not
speaking.
mr.
gordon
boller
for
the
church.
mr.
gordon
boller
just
as
a
man
does
who
speak
through
acts
for
a
corporation
in
any
capacity
i
take
it,
that
he
is
representing
the
doctrine,
principle
his
action
and
the
corporate
name
constitutes
the
corporate
action.
mr.
gordon
boller
well
i
want
to
attempt
to
maintain
the
distinction
between
belief
and
action,
not
particular
material
here,
the
question
here,
the
distinction
between
belief
and
action,
neither
the
constitutional
provision
or
the
statute
place
any
obstruction
upon
belief
or
opinion,
instead
they
aim
at
action,
incitement.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
possibility
of
that
is
obviated,
but
just
the
fact
that
the
condition
prescribed
for
the
settling
of
the
question
is
the
signing
of
the
affidavit.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
does
so
far
as
the
--
as
an
administrative
matter
it
does.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
settles
it
so
far
as
the
agencies
of
government
are
concerned
--
mr.
gordon
boller
force
or
violence
or
other
unlawful
means.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
would
be
means
of
the
same,
within
the
same
category
as
force
and
violence.
it's
an
(inaudible)
situation.
mr.
gordon
boller
force
and
violence
or
other
unlawful
means,
other
i
take
it
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it
takes
character
though,
it
takes
character
from
the
two
preceding
adjectives
i
assume
for
--
mr.
gordon
boller
that
would
not
be
of
the
same
character,
force
or
violence,
other
unlawful
means,
would
be
sabotage
perhaps,
it
would
be
assassination.
it
would
be
at
the
same
character
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes,
i
should
think
so,
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
gordon
boller
the
law
of
the
country
i
suppose,
of
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
gordon
boller
well,
no
i
would
not
think
so.
i
would
think
that
the
reference
in
a
california
constitution
or
a
california
statute
to
lawful
means
would
refer
to
california
--
mr.
gordon
boller
california
law.
mr.
gordon
boller
because
it
seemed
reasonable
to
me
that
a
statute
in
a
constitution
written
in
a
california
setting
would
have
--
mr.
gordon
boller
well,
in
the
first
place
i
take
it
that
the
secretary
of
the
man
making
the
affidavit
is
speaking
for
the
organization
of
which
he
is
an
officer,
and
that
he
has
ascertained
what
its
action
and
what
its
attitude
and
what
its
action
is.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
take
it
that
would
be
--
mr.
gordon
boller
i
take
it
that
would
be
his
justification
--
mr.
gordon
boller
no.
the
--
mr.
gordon
boller
the
statute
merely
provides
that
the
exemption
must
be
claimed
by
the
claimant
each
year
during
the
assessment
season
and
prior
to
a
certain
date,
and
the
affidavit
claiming
that
exemption
provided
to
him
for
his
signature
contains
recital
in
the
language
of
the
affidavit
that
the
claimant
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force,
violence
or
other
unlawful
means.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
church.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
church,
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
property
owner.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
would
be
the
property
owner,
the
church
organization.
precisely
as
it
is
with
regard
to
an
individual,
if
the
individual
claimant,
whether
he
be
a
veteran
or
whoever
else
might
claim
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
the
same
difficulty
that
a
corporation
is
not
the
same
as
a
person
and
a
normal
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
that
i
construe
to
mean
advocating
war
support,
war
time
support
of
an
enemy
of
the
united
states.
mr.
gordon
boller
this
was
in
1952,
1953,
we
were
not
--
mr.
gordon
boller
we
were
not
at
war
no
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
boller
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
against
such
advocacy.
the
attitude
and
the
--
mr.
gordon
boller
that
is
--
that's
the
more
difficult
of
the
alternatives
that
the
constitution
and
statute
provision
carry
--
mr.
gordon
boller
except
that
it's
in
the
present
tense.
mr.
gordon
boller
no
it's
in
the
present
tense
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
boller
that
they
do
not
now
advocate
the
support
of
a
foreign
government.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
should
think
that
was
probably
so,
yes.
but
--
mr.
gordon
boller
i
wouldn't
think
so,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
the
aid
to
individuals
in
distress,
even
of
a
foreign
power
at
war
with
us
--
mr.
gordon
boller
i
shouldn't
think
so,
no.
the
question
of
policy,
government
policy
and
action,
the
question
of
the
conduct
of
men
in
office,
the
possibility
of
criticism
of
officials
in
government
for
venal
or
corrupt
conduct,
those
are
matters
that
are
fully
open
to
question,
to
criticism,
to
--
mr.
gordon
boller
a
foreign
government
is
not
something
else.
it
isn't
the
individuals,
the
stressed
individuals
who
constitute
its
populous
for
one
thing.
i
may
run
over
it
somewhat
by
elimination.
it
does
not
constitute
the
individuals.
it
represents
the
agency.
it
represents
the
government
as
its
states.
it
is
with
respect
to
government
action.
it
is
not
with
respect
to
individual
need,
individual
merit
it
maybe.
it
is
not
with
regard
to
disassociated
individual
conduct.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
think
probably
i'm
speculating
merely,
i
haven't
had
the
suggestion
made
before
as
your
honor
is
putting
it,
that
the
claimant
is
signing
part
and
is
striking
the
balance.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
think
maybe
so,
whether
it
was
divisible,
whether
the
fact
that
one
part
failed
would
necessarily
carry
down
the
other
is
--
mr.
gordon
boller
as
advisor
to
the
county
assessor
of
los
angeles
county,
we'd
tell
them
to
grant
the
exemption
probably.
mr.
gordon
boller
off
hand,
it's
been
rather
an
off
hand
opinion
here,
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
i
don't
want
to
be
led
into
conceding
too
much,
i
shouldn't
do
that
should
i?
[laughter]
mr.
gordon
boller
if
the
men
down
in
washington
did
that,
why
it
would
good
enough
for
us
that
go
along
i'm
sure.
[laughter]
mr.
gordon
boller
now
the
first
part
is
clear,
the
first
part
is
language
that
has
been
adjudicated.
there
is
not
the
uncertainty
about
that,
that
you
gentlemen
are
suggesting
as
to
the
second.
mr.
gordon
boller
as
to
that
no
surely
not.
the
answer
to
that
can
be
easy
and
can
be
clear.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
basis
for
this
exemption,
the
basis
for
these
two
provisions
of
constitution
and
of
statute,
is
not
apprehension
of
overthrow
of
government,
it
is
not
peril
to
the
government,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
persistence
and
continuance
of
government.
it
is
instead
danger
of
defeat
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
exemption
is
granted.
the
exemption
is
accorded
as
i
suggested
earlier
as
an
aid
to
the
general
atmosphere
in
which
a
constitutional
government
exists,
for
its
benefit
in
raising
the
standards
of
conduct
and
morality
in
private
and
public
life,
and
the
danger
is
of
defeating
that
purpose
which
is
sought
to
be
accomplished
by
the
granting
of
the
exemption,
its
not
a
danger
of
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
wirin
in
his
argument
--
mr.
gordon
boller
no,
it
isn't
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
boller
no
that's
quite
too
narrow,
that's
quite
to
narrow
your
honor.
it's
to
maintain
a
high
attitude
and
teaching,
high
position
by
the
church
in
the
community
as
an
aid
toward
advancing
morals
and
virtue
and
integrity
and
ideals
in
the
populous.
and
that,
that
--
mr.
gordon
boller
and
that
the
church
or
any
other
recipient
of
exemption
benefit,
who
advocates
these
doctrines,
is
acting
contrary
to
such
an
influence,
is
ceasing
to
meet
the
purpose
for
which
the
exemption
is
granted.
mr.
gordon
boller
there
is
--
no,
there
is
discussion
of
it
as
indicating
the
purposes
of
the
exemption
in
the
opinion
by
the
california
court
which
is
here
under
review
--
mr.
gordon
boller
the
only
thing
that
bears
on
that
at
all
is
the
argument
to
the
voters
which
is
to
be
provided
to
you
gentlemen
and
that
--
mr.
gordon
boller
pardon
me?
mr.
gordon
boller
it
does
to
an
extent,
yes.
it
speaks
of
the
benefiting
communists
and
others
of
that
sort,
but
the
purpose
of
legislation
as
i
was
starting
to
say
is
indicated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
if
i'm
reading
in
the
record
at
page
51.
it
first
indicates
reading
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
it
first
indicates
a
very
insignificant
purpose
to
be
accomplished,
the
interest
of
the
state
in
protecting
its
revenue
raising
program
from
subversive
exploitation
has
already
been
considered.
then
it
goes
on,
there
are
additional
interests
with
which
the
state
is
concerned
and
which
it
is
attempting
to
promote
by
granting
exemptions
from
taxation.
included
is
the
interest
of
the
state
in
maintaining
the
loyalty
of
its
people
and
thus
safeguarding
against
its
violent
overthrow
by
internal
or
external
forces.
this
legitimate
objective
is
sought
to
be
accomplished
by
placing
any
favored
economic
position
and
thus
to
promote
their
wellbeing
and
sphere
of
the
influence,
those
particular
persons
and
groups
of
individuals
who
are
capable
of
formulating
policies
relating
to
good
morals
and
respect
for
the
law.
it
has
been
said
that
when
church
properties
are
exempted
from
taxation,
it
must
be
because
apart
from
religious
considerations,
churches
as
regarded
as
institutions
established
to
inculcate
principles
of
sound
morality
leading
citizens
to
a
more
ready
obedience
to
the
laws.
the
same
maybe
said
about
as
enjoying
tax
exemptions.
mr.
gordon
boller
to
keep
them
away
and
turn
them
away
from
--
mr.
gordon
boller
infiltration
of
communists
would
be
one
--
mr.
gordon
boller
as
i'm
saying
the
issue
in
the
case
is
not
as
to
whether
the
particular
church
advocates
or
does
not
advocate
it
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
we're
not
saying
that
none
of
them
does,
we're
saying
that
is
beside
the
point,
we
do
not
know.
mr.
gordon
boller
well,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
make
--
that
we're
entitled
to
make
an
assumption
one
way
or
the
other
because
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
for
the
assumption.
it
has
not
been
alleged
that
they
do
not
advocate.
the
complaint
does
not
allege
that
they
do
not
advocate.
the
complaint
doesn't
--
neither
brings
the
church
within
the
constitutional
provision,
it
does
not
bring
it
within
the
constitutional
provision
by
alleging
that
they
do
not
advocate.
it
affirmatively
places
it
outside
the
statute
--
mr.
gordon
boller
i
want
to
approach
it,
disassociate
it
entirely
from
the
question
and
without
assumption
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
the
petitioners
are
not
entitled
to
say
that
they
do
not
advocate,
because
they
have
not
made
that
an
issue
in
the
case.
in
consequence
it
was
not
considered
in
the
trial
court,
it
could
not
be,
it
was
a
question
purely
of
law
as
has
been
indicated,
question
raised
by
the
merits
of
the
complaint.
mr.
gordon
boller
well
that
wasn't
my
phrase,
keep
them
on
their
toes.
[laughter]
mr.
gordon
boller
its
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes,
yes,
that's
part
of
the
language.
mr.
gordon
boller
that
the
state
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes,
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
an
aid
to
them.
it's
an
aid,
it's
an
aid
to
those
churches
who
meet
and
forward
that
purpose,
whose
activity
and
life
in
the
community
forward
an
interest
which
the
public
and
the
state
is
interested
in
which
is
a
benefit
to
the
state
and
which
is
a
justification
for
a
gratuity,
an
award
which
is
given
to
them.
when
they
fail
to
meet
that
purpose,
when
they
fail
to
accomplish
that
end,
the
justification
for
that
reward
and
gratuity
is
gone
and
it
is
justifiable
and
proper
--
mr.
gordon
boller
state
established,
yes
by
(inaudible)
vote
of
the
people,
it's
--
mr.
gordon
boller
yes
i
think
that
means
that.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes.
mr.
gordon
boller
the
question
of
exemption
--
mr.
gordon
boller
the
question
of
exemption
i
take
it
is
a
matter
for
determination
of
the
state
by
its
people
and
the
question
was
put
by
one
of
you
gentlemen
to
mr.
wirin
as
to
whether
the
state
could
withdraw
exemption,
assuredly
it's
a
matter
of
state
policy.
mr.
gordon
boller
yes
the
exemption
of
churches
from
exemption
is
historical,
it's
traditional.
i
don't
think
there's
any
possibility
now
of
questioning
it
on
the
basis
of
idea
that
it
may
breach
the
wall
between
the
church
and
the
state.
mr.
gordon
boller
now
your
question
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
--
mr.
gordon
boller
now
it
isn't
doctrine
in
general,
it's
just
two
specific
advocacies.
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
those
two
--
mr.
gordon
boller
it's
to
deter
two
specified
doctrines
and
question
whether
the
specification
of
doctrines
might
be
enlarged
or
broadened
to
include
others
is
not
now
before
us.
we
do
have
these
two
doctrines
and
these
two
doctrines
as
(inaudible)
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
and
so
within
the
justification
to
discourage
them.
mr.
gordon
boller
no,
i
shouldn't
think
so.
thank
you
your
honor.
