well
mr.
bourne
if
it
was
valid,
what's
the
significance
that
whether
it
had
one
or
four
proposes,
i
don't
follow
that?
why
are
you
arguing
so
strenuously
that
the
three
additional
purposes
urged
on
as
part
of
the
government,
were
not
purposes
of
the
order
at
all,
but
it
had
as
its
single
purpose
forcing
gold
miners
into
the
hard
rock
mine.
why
you
are
arguing
that
so
strenuously,
i
don't
follow.
justice

brennan,

where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me
mr.
doub,
if
in
fact
the
only
purpose
of
this
l-208
order
was
to
accomplish
the
shift
from
the
gold
mines
to
the
hard
rock
mines
particularly
the
copper
mines
of
miners,
if
that
in
fact
was
the
only
purpose
of
it,
would
it
have
been
a
valid
order?
