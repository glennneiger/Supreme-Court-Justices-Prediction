mr.
edward
w.
bourne
if
the
court
please
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
little
bit
as
far
as
this
matter
of
the
special
jurisdictional
act
because
i
think
possibly,
quite
unintentionally
mr.
doub,
developed
a
little
confusion
on
that
subject
although
i
think
what
he
said
at
the
end
was
completely
correct.
the
suits
bought
by
these
respondents
were
brought
before
the
passage
of
the
special
jurisdictional
act.
we're
here
in
this
court
--
we
would
be
here
in
this
court
even
if
there
were
no
special
jurisdictional
act.
then
after
the
pleadings
were
sustained
in
some
of
these
cases,
but
in
the
opinion
and
what's
called
the
idaho
maryland
case,
congress
passed
this
special
jurisdictional
act
as
a
result
of
which
the
other
claimants,
who
had
not
filed,
were
permitted
to
do
so.
now,
there
was
no
decision
that
there
was
not
a
taking.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
was
a
decision,
that
there
was
a
taking,
but
there
certainly
was
no
decision
that
there
was
one.
mr.
doub's
reply
brief,
rather
poopoes
the
reports
of
the
two
committees,
and
particularly
the
quotation
in
those
two
reports
of
a
prior
report
of
a
subcommittee
of
the
committee
of
war
claims
which
was
never
approved
by
the
whole
committee
of
the
war
claims.
but
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
i
think
his
statement
for
present
purposes
of
argument,
that
we
can
each
get
some
comfort
out
of
those
committee
reports,
is
a
bare
one
and
the
--
one
of
the
two
committee
reports
are
identical,
one
of
them
is
in
the
record
in
full,
and
we've
quoted
those
portions
of
the
report
that
we
think
are
most
persuasive
and
mr.
doub
has
quoted
those
that
he
thinks
ought
to
be
persuasive
against
this.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
the
report
is
--
plaintiff's
exhibit
178,
page
1559
of
the
record,
volume
two.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
we're
standing
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
we
are
standing
on
both
grounds
your
honor.
our
principal
argument
in
the
court
of
claims
and
our
principal
argument
here
has
been
that
there
was
a
taking.
we
make
the
further
argument
that
whether
that
was
a
taking
or
not,
we're
entitled
to
recovery
under
the
special
jurisdictional
act.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
we
think
that
the
only
criterion
for
judgment
by
the
court
of
claims
is
a
proof
that
there
was
a
loss
as
a
result
of
the
closing
down
of
the
mines.
nobody
could
recover,
if
he
was
all
out
of
critical
materials.
nobody
could
recover
if
all
his
employees
had
been
drafted,
but
that
he
was
shut
down
then
we
think
the
congress
intended
to
give
him
a
right
of
recovery.
now
what
happened
is
that
in
the
court
of
claims
the
court
of
claims
decided
in
our
favor
on
the
taking
point
and
said
that
it
was
a
necessary
to
decide
the
other
point
and
mr.
doub
like
to
use
it
that
was
equivalent
to
an
adverse
decision.
we
don't
agree
with
that.
he
is
correct
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
we
asked
to
hold
the
judgment
here
on
any
ground
that
–
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
that's
exactly
right
your
honor
and
you
in
response
to
a
question
that
your
honor
put
you
will
find
a
detailed
review
in
our
brief
of
the
special
jurisdictional
acts.
now
i
beg
leave
not
to
go
into
that
detail
now
because
it
is
after
all
only
one
aspect
of
the
case
–
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
that's
in
our
brief.
it's
in
the
last
point
and
contains
a
very
extensive
study.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
haven't
considered
that
point
at
all
sir,
i
haven't
considered
that
point
all.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
but
you
still
have
power
i
take
it
to
interpret
the
law
and
see
whether
that's
what
those
statutes
say.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
now
i
would
like
to
say
this
much,
because
i
think
this
is
very
important.
you
heard
a
short
speech
on
the
fairness
of
this
order
in
the
eyes
of
assistant
attorney
general.
i
am
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
read
what
the
committees'
--
the
judiciary
committees
of
the
house
and
the
senate
said
about
the
history
of
this
order
what
it
did,
nor
am
i
going
to
take
the
time
to
discuss
the
prior
report
of
the
committee
on
war
claims
which
was
quoted
in
full,
practically
in
full
by
the
two
committees.
now
they
dispose
of
those
reports
in
their
briefs
as
saying
reports,
opinions
of
representatives
of
mining
states.
these
were
the
committees
of
the
house
and
the
senate
who
said
they
had
considered
the
matter
very
carefully
and
they
have
the
benefit
of
a
full
hearing
before
the
sub-committee
or
the
committee
on
war
claims.
so
they
went
into
the
facts
and
i
am
going
to
say
later
in
no
unmistakable
language
that
there
is
an
issue
in
fact
in
this
case
and
i
point
out
that
when
they
went
into
the
text,
they
pointed
out
that
it
was
most
unjust
not
to
provide
compensation
for
these
companies,
individuals,
a
150
in
number,
some
large,
many
small,
most
small,
who
were
singled
out
and
deprived
of
their
right
to
use
their
property
in
order
that
their
labor
could
be
thrown
on
the
market
and
for
no
other
purpose
as
i
will
show
you
shortly.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
there
would
be
at
least
one
difference
your
honor
and
that
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
taking,
if
i
understand
the
law,
you
are
entitled
to
the
value
of
the
property
taken
with
interest
in
the
date
of
the
taking.
and
–
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
sir?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
taking,
taking
was
the
right
to
use,
right
to
mine
the
gold.
that
was,
that
was
the
property
taken
as
a
right
to
mine
gold,
i
don't
know
whether
i'll
have
an
opportunity
to
go
into
that,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i
think
you
would
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
we
certainly
--
i
will
but
frank
in
saying
that
we
certainly
would
expect
a
claim
that
we
are
to
be
put
in
the
position
we
would
have
been
in
if
the
order
have
never
been
issued.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
what
would
happen
if
we
had
operated?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
that's
what
we
would
claim
but
may
i,
i
have
a
note
to
answer
your
question,
it
was
put
to
mr.
doub
and
that
is
that
there
has
been
no
decision
whatever
here
about
damages.
the
procedure
as
i
am
sure
your
honor
knows
in
the
court
of
claims
is
that
you
have
a
judgment
whether
or
not
there
is
a
judgment
and
then
you
have
a
decision
later
as
to
damages.
now
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
if
under
the
special
jurisdictional
acts,
in
the
absence
of
something
that's
completely
plain
there
is
no
recovery
of
interest,
but
we
think
there
would
be
a
recovery
of
interest
if
there
was
a
taking.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i'd
rather
not
have
to
be
--
try
to
answer
that
explicitly
sir
to
say
that
they
may
--
might
argue
that
the
special
jurisdiction
act
has
some
more
limited
effect
as
to
damages,
but
we
are
here
only
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
of
recovery,
and
our
first
point
is
there's
right
of
recovery
because
of
the
taking.
our
second
point
is
that
there
is
a
right
of
recovery
anyhow
because
the
special
jurisdictional
act
granted
this
one.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
sir.
now
i
would
like
to
dispose
some
other
details
first
before
i
go
into
my
own
affirmative
presentation
which
i
will
try
to
cover
as
much
as
i
can.
mr.
doub
i
am
sure
gave
a
sort
of
special
sanction
to
this
order
by
referring
the
fact
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
was
the
general
counsel
with
wpd
and
quoting
at
great
length
or
considerable
length
from
an
article
he
wrote
about
the
performances
of
the
wpd.
and
i
would
suppose
that
this
court
knowing
the
reputation
of
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
would
assume
that
any
order
that
for
which
he
was
responsible
was
probably
a
sound
order,
but
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
government's
counsel
in
the
court
of
claims
when
he
gave
the
list
of
witnesses
who
were
going
to
testify
for
the
government
said
at
one
point
the
next
witness
will
be
mr.
john
lord
o'brian,
general
counsel
of
the
war
production
board
and
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
was
never
called.
another
witness
we
referred
to
earlier
was
mr.
i.
n.
p.
stokes
who
was
assistant
general
counsel
of
orders
and
regulations
of
war
production
board
and
mr.
i.
n.
p.
stokes
was
never
called.
now
i
don't
think
that
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
can
properly
be
brought
here
as
a
sort
of
a
witness
in
the
background
in
support
of
this
order
or
in
support
of
the
theory
of
no
liability
or
in
defense
of
what
was
contained
in
the
order
to
which
i
will
refer
very
shortly.
mr.
justice
harlan
inquired
whether
these
respondents
could
have
continued
if
there
had
not
been
any
order
l-208
the
answer
is
that
the
findings
as
to
three
or
four
of
the
respondents
are
that
they
could
have
continued
throughout
to
june
30th
of
1945
and
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
other
two
are
not
so
explicit,
but
that
they
are
that
they
were
shut
down.
all
was
shut
down
by
the
order.
mr.
justice
douglas
inquired
whether
the
orofino
case
had
been
distinguished
or
reversed
by
the
court
of
claims?
it
was
distinguished.
it
was
distinguished
on
the
ground
that
in
the
orofino
complaint
there
were
conclusory
allegations,
and
only
conclusory
allegations.
whereas
in
the
idaho
maryland
opinion
which
is
the
one
dismissing
the
motions
that
--
dismissing
the
demurs
with
respect
to
idaho
maryland
and
homestake
and
one
other
company,
the
court
dealt
with
the
detailed
allegations
and
it
said
we
are
not
bound
by
your
penal
opinion
because
nothing
was
pleaded
at
the
conclusions.
now,
i
must
protest
against
the
references
to
the
gold
mines
and
to
gold
mining,
as
if
there
was
something
evil,
noxious,
unpatriotic
or
whatnot
about
it
during
world
war
ii.
we
all
know
from
our
own
experience
that
all
manner
of
non-essential
industries
were
permitted
to
continue.
gold
mining
was
a
non-essential
industry,
but
it
was
permitted
to
continue,
and
there
is
nothing
remotely
similar
and
gold
mining
is
nothing,
not
all
similar
to
the
production
of
liquor
or
the
margarine
or
anything
that's
noxious.
at
the
very
meeting
of
the
wpb
at
which
this
order
was
authorized,
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
fact
that
gold
mining
machinery
and
equipment
was
being
sent
to
south
africa,
canada,
columbia
and
honduras,
and
the
government
says
i
think
with
some
justification
that
in
the
case
of
south
africa,
whereas
you
recall
general
smuts
just
held
the
bear
balance
of
power.
it
was
wise
public
policy
to
send
our
gold
mining
equipment
and
enable
the
government
to
continue,
but
what
about
honduras?
how
can
the
government
say
that
we
should
have
said
gold
mining
to
honduras,
and
the
gold
mining
equipment,
gold
mining
equipment
to
honduras
and
then
it's
noxious?
the
government
wanted
hard
rock
miners,
which
it
thought
would
be
useful,
and
i'll
come
to
that,
and
that's
all
that
was.
the
situation
so
far
as
not
essentiality
and
discrimination
was
precisely
the
same
as
in
innumerable
other
industries
using
skilled
workers.
we
had
a
system
of
selective
service.
we
had
a
system
with
priorities
allocations
and
we
had
no
system
for
the
labor
draft.
and
this
l208
was
a
kind
of
a
special
labor
draft
of
its
own,
applied
to
one
group
of
companies
and
individuals.
and
being
a
special
one
and
being
as
they
say
the
court
of
claims
found;
unwise
and
ill
conceived,
it
proved
to
be
a
tragic
failure.
and
that's
why
the
congress
said
what
it
said,
not
only
because
thing
was
unwise
in
the
first
place,
but
because
it
proved
to
be
a
failure.
not
because
as
mr.
doub
generously
admitted
of
any
failure
on
the
part
of
the
gold
mining
companies
to
cooperate,
they
cooperated
to
the
fullest
degree.
now
it's
true
they
didn't
bring
any
injunction
actions,
but
they
did
marshal
what
i
would
have
supposed,
would
be
the
strongest
representation
that
they
could
possibly
have
hoped
to
get.
21
united
states
senators
who
wrote
a
long
letter
to
the
president
shortly
after
the
order
was
issued,
protesting,
pointing
out
why
it
was
no
good,
protesting
that
it
was
being
done,
telling
what
it
was
going
to
mean
to
place
like
(inaudible)
and
deadwood,
north
dakota;
where
19,000
people
were
dependent
upon
one
mining
company,
but
that
ended
up
with
this,
and
i
think
this
is
one
paragraph
i
want
to
read
if
i
never
get
a
chance
to
read
another,
it
was
the
last
one,
this
was
addressed
to
the
president.
we
respectably
bring
this
matter
to
your
attention
with
the
request
that
you
stay
the
order
made
by
the
war
production
board
affecting
the
gold
mining
operations
of
united
states,
at
least
until
the
whole
subject
of
the
marshaling
of
manpower
and
the
allocation
of
labor
maybe
considered
and
the
vital
questions
involved
concluded.
thus
that
the
gold
mining
industry
may
not
be
subjected
to
unwarranted
and
unusual
hardship
and
injury
which
may
not
eventually
be
considered
necessary
and
which
may
not
be
equitability
gone
by
other
industries.
there
is
one
other
thing
that
i
do
want
to
read
if
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
able
to
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
that
in
finding
52,
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
record,
page
110.
that
is
that
paragraph,
is
it
not
(inaudible),
that
paragraph
starts
bottom
of
page
110.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i'm
afraid
i'm
a
flaw
in
this
respect
your
honor
and
that
is
mr.
doub
has
perhaps
with
some
skill
deflected
me
into
the
line
that
you've
been
taking
about.
you
will
find
very
fully
developed
in
our
brief,
the
proposition
that
this
constituted
a
taking.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
and
we've
also
developed
the
proposition
that
it
constituted
--
that
it
was
an
authorized
taking,
that
there
was
authority
not
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
the
basis
very
simply
stated
your
honor
is
that
the
president
had
the
authority
and
that
the
president
approved
the
action
of
the
wpb,
but
i
had
to
deal
or
what
i
should
deal
with
the
proposition
that
this
is
noxious,
that
the
gold
mining
was
noxious.
now,
even
though
i
would
like
to
go
in
to
the
legal
propositions.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
may
is
say
this
your
honor,
i
want
to
say
this
much,
either
this
taking
things
out
of
order.
essentially
this
is
what
happened.
the
war
department
told
the
wpb,
they
wanted
the
gold
mine
shut,
and
the
war
department
decided
to
shut
the
--
and
the
wpb
decided
to
shut
the
gold
mine.
they
decided
to
camouflage
what
they
were
doing
and
i
use
my
words
advisably,
and
we
prove
it
by
findings.
they
decided
to
camouflage
that
in
the
preamble,
they
said
whereas
because
of
the
shortage
of
the
critical
materials
for
export
et
cetera,
which
was
the
stock
whereas
clause
were
with
allocation
on
it.
then
in
the
paragraphs
b2
and
b3
which
were
subject
to
the
colloquy
between
mr.
doub
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
said
you
can't
use
any
materials,
not
any
critical
materials,
but
you
can't
use
any
materials
in
gold
mining,
that
was
a
mere
implementation
of
the
shutdown
provision.
i
skipped
myself
by
saying
that
paragraph
b1
was
a
direct
and
explicit
order
to
the
homestake
mining
company,
the
central
eureka
mining
company,
the
bald
mountain
mining
company,
and
all
the
other
ones,
you
shutdown
your
gold
mines
and
if
you
want
to
do
anything
beyond
what
we
say
you
can
do,
you
must
file
an
appeal
to
us
and
we
will
tell
you
just
what
you
can
do.
it
was
precisely
what
happened
in
the
pewee
coal
company
case
except
that
in
the
case
of
the
pewee
coal
company
there
was
a
continuance
of
operation.
in
this
case
there
was
a
cessation
of
operations
because
that's
what
the
government
wanted.
the
government
wanted
to
have
the
hard
rock
miners
thrown
on
the
market
and
then
they
were
going
to
try
and
take
them
and
shoo
them
out
to
butte,
montana
and
climax
colorado
in
the
hope
they
would
go
in
the
non-ferrous
metal
mines.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
no,
without
–
no,
i
would
say
that
that
was
authorized
by
the
title
2
of
the
second
war
project
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief
and
is
not
disputed
by
mr.
doub
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
your
honor
i
don't
like
to
answer
the
question
about
the
congress
because
i
am
not
clear
in
my
own
mind
to
what
extent
--
of
course
i
am
not
so
sure
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
implied
an
acknowledgment
that,
the
frank
acknowledgment
by
the
congress
of
the
purpose
of
the
order.
i
think
when
he
put
this
question
to
me
he
was
talking
about
an
order
like
this
one
which
didn't
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
think
it
might
well
be
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
as
applied
to
congress
i
think
the
situation,
the
cases
seem
to
have
gone
very
far
that
in
saying
that
you
can't
go
behind
a
declaration
of
a
congressional
premise,
but
i
don't
read
the
cases
such
as
i
read
as
meaning
that
if
the
executive
does
something
that
amounts
to
a
taking
that
the
legal
effect
of
the
taking
can
be
avoided.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i
submit
that
it
is
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
our
argument
and
your
honor
refers
to
it
as
the
whole
industry
actually
it
was
150
companies
and
individuals
and
i
can't
see
why
under
these
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
no
sir,
that
was
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
no
i
don't
think
i
said
that,
i
think
mr.
doub
was
the
one
who
reported
on
the
audit
it
affected
all
those
which
did
not
produce
substantial
quantities
of
non-ferrous
metals,
other
metals.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
might
say
that
they
consider
that
at
the
time
and
i
dare
say
some
lawyers
gave
thought
to
it
and
they
decided
not
to
do
it.
now
–
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
the
only
light
there
is
in
the
record
that
i
know
of
your
honor
is
that
the
suggestion
was
made
i
believe
in
july
that
there
ought
to
be
a
shut
down
of
the
gold
mines
and
then
it
could
be
accomplished
by
strangling.
now
it
would
not
have
been,
it
would
not
have
been
sufficient,
it
would
not
have
been
to
say
they
couldn't
buy
things
because
they
had
enough
things
to
keep
going.
but
obviously
if
they
had
said
you
can't
use
anything
that
you
got
you
are
practically
saying
you
got
to
shut
down,
that
would
have
been
an
indirect
way
and
you
are
making
--
the
question
that
you
are
putting
is
along
the
line
of
the
dissent
of
the
chief
judge
in
the
court
of
claims
and
he
said
strike
out
the
directive
for
the
shut
down
and
you
still
have
enough
there
to
strangle
the
gold
mine.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i
don't,
i
will
say
this
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
right
to
use
a
power
over
critical
materials
to
strangle
a
business
so
as
to
throw
the
employees
on
the
market
and
try
and
get
them
go
somewhere
else.
now
your
question
doesn't
pertain
to
whether
that's
right
or
wrong,
your
question
pertains
as
to
whether
or
not
if
they
had
done
that,
we'd
have
a
harder
time
than
we
are
having
now,
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
there
again
i
find
myself
unable
to
answer
the
question
which
is
very
pertinent.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
throughout
the
years
of
the
war
it's
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
in
history
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i'd
like
to
bring
out
one
thing
that
i
do
really
feel
is
fundamental
here.
it
maybe
not
in
the
minds
of
all
the
court
but
i
am
bound
to
think
it
must
be
--
will
be
influential
in
the
minds
of
some
and
that
is
i
do
not
agree
at
all
with
the
assistant
attorney
general's
statement
that
this
whole
controversy
is
the
facts
in
this
case.
and
to
my
mind
the
most
extraordinary
feature
of
the
case
as
it
appears
before
this
court
is
that
the
court
--
that
that
attorney
general's
brief
wholly
disregarded
the
findings
and
facts
of
the
court
of
claims.
and
i
say
wholly,
actually
there
is
a
reference,
a
critical
reference
to
one
sentence
and
one
claim.
except
for
that
the
entire
presentation
is
precisely
the
kind
of
a
presentation
that
a
zealous
lawyer
might
have
made
before
the
commissioner.
in
fact
a
great
deal
of
it
will
be
found
to
have
been
lifted
verbatim
from
request
that
they
made
of
the
commission,
the
commission
had
turned
down
a
request
that
were
made
of
the
court
of
claims
that
the
court
of
claims
have
turned
down.
there
is
no
--
it
is
all
completely
divorced
in
the
findings
and
fact
of
the
court
of
claims
and
your
honor's
have
here
to
our
great
regret
not
only
a
long
factual
discussion
in
our
brief,
but
a
very
long
appendix
required
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
hasn't
accepted
the
findings,
the
fact
of
the
court
of
claims.
now
let
me
take
just
one
thing.
i
consider
it
a
very,
very
important
point,
but
whether
it's
important
or
not,
it
shows
the
existence
of
an
issue,
of
fact.
we
say
that
there
was
only
one
purpose,
this
order,
and
that
was
as
the
chairman
of
the
wpb
said
to
maneuver
hard
rock
miners,
that
was
the
only
purpose
and
the
court
of
claims
so
found.
now
that
finding
was
vigorously
litigated
before
the
commissioner.
the
commissioner
said
there
was
another
purpose,
secondary
but
still
a
purpose,
and
that
was
to
conserve
critical
materials
and
we
objected
to
that
and
that
was
knocked
out
by
the
court
of
claims.
now
what
has
happened,
in
their
petition
for
certiorari,
they
said
there
were
two
purposes,
one
to
conserve
critical
materials
and
two,
to
maneuver
hard
rock
miners.
well
they
were
not
apparently
satisfied
with
that
statement
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
so
along
they
came
in
the
brief
and
they
changed
the
question
presented,
and
they
now
say
there
were
four
purposes.
one,
it
mentioned
more
or
less
--
well
i
don't
that
the
mining
purpose,
second
to
get
labor
to
go
into
other
essential
industries,
that
is
to
get
the
surplus
employees
of
the
gold
mines
to
go
work
somewhere
else;
three
to
serve
critical
materials
and
four
to
divert
mining
machinery
and
equipment.
now
by
spreading
out
their
petition
for
certiorari,
they
have
i
think
fundamentally
equated
changed
the
case
that
is
presented
in
this
court,
but
whether
that,
i
am
right
about
that
or
not,
they
have
legitimatized
so
to
speak
the
most
expansive
factual
treatment
that
you
can
possibly
imagine
and
in
the
process
of
the
expanded
factual
treatment,
they
have
it
seems
to
me
at
least
taken
the
greatest
liberties
with
the
documentary
record,
and
i
repeat,
they
do
not
mention
findings
as
findings,
they
don't
say
which
findings
they
agree
with
and
which
findings
they
don't
agree
with
and
to
look
to
us
this
case
is
predominantly
factual.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i
had
this
thought
in
my
mind.
i
don't
want
to
perhaps
express
too
positive
an
opinion
about
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
were
the
truth,
if
it
were
the
fact,
that
these
gold
mines
were
acquiring
--
first
let
me
go
back
and
say
this.
long
before
this
order
was
issued,
the
gold
mines
were
precluded,
effectively
precluded
from
getting
any
critical
materials,
that's
found
explicitly
and
that
particular
finding
is
cited
by
them,
although
then
they
go
and
later
seem
to
disregard
it.
now,
it
had
been
true
that
the
gold
mines
were
getting
critical
materials,
in
other
words
that
they
were
being
bootlegged.
now
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
this
order
couldn't
be
sustained,
but
there
isn't
a
shred
of
a
suggestion
in
the
record
that,
that
was
true,
not
a
shred
of
it.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
think
that
the
court
of
claims
stated
the
correct
rule
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
of
claims
was
right
in
saying
that
where
any
litigant
has
the
--
assumes
the
burden
of
challenging
the
announced
purpose
of
an
executive,
and
this
is
i
think
is
an
executive,
not
an
administrative
body
your
honor,
this
is
an
agency
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
then
that
litigant
has
a
most
difficult
burden
to
sustain,
that
our
position
on
that
your
honor
is
very
simple
and
that
is,
we
knew
it
was
a
difficult
burden
and
we
sustained
it
in
full.
and
here
is
what
the
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
the
morgan
case?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
your
honor
here
is
what
the
court
of
claims
said
and
--
i
think
this
line
of
questioning
is
pertinent
and
related
to
some
questions
that
mr.
justice
harlan
put
earlier,
but
i
think
this
statement
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law
and
i
feel
that
so
far
as
the
taking
point
is
concerned,
we
stand
on
this,
this
is
what
the
court
said
on
the
denying
a
motion
for
anew
trial.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
page
145,
denying
a
motion
for
new
trial,
the
court
of
claims
said
with
reference
to
its
original
decision,
the
court
held
that
what
wpb
said
it
was
doing
and
what
it
in
fact
the
law
did,
were
two
different
things,
and
that
the
government
could
not
escape
the
obligation
of
paying
just
compensation
to
what
it
had
the
authority
to
take
and
in
fact
took,
simply
by
calling
its
action
of
taking
a
priorities
order
or
an
allocation
order,
now
i
think
that's
good
law,
and
may
i
put
this
as
an
analogy.
the
atwater
case
in
the
court
of
claims
was
an
interesting
case,
in
that
there,
there
was
no
rendition
so
called.
there
the
government
was
--
had
a
firing
range
on
fire
island.
and
as
a
matter
of
safety,
they
told
owners
of
property
not
to
use
their
property
within
the
orbit
of
the
guns
that
were
being
shot,
and
the
court
of
claims
held
that,
that
was
a
taking.
now
supposing
if
that
army
commander
had,
had
two
powers,
one
was
the
power
to
take
property
and
the
other
was
the
power
to
exclude
owners
of
property
from
their
property
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
threat
to
the
health
of
the
soldiers
and
supposing
that
army
commander
issues
an
order
and
said
because
of
the
danger
of
asiatic
flu,
everybody
within
the
range
of
15
miles,
which
happens
to
be
the
range
of
the
longest
gun
at
the
time,
must
get
off
their
property
and
supposing
it
were
established
beyond
the
slightest
question
that
the
purpose
of
the
order
was
to
have
a
safety
dome
so
they
could
shoot
guns
and
that
there
was
no
danger
whatever
of
the
asiatic
flu.
can
the
executive,
and
this
is
the
question,
that
there
being
a
constitutional
question
here,
this
is
it,
can
the
executive
take
property
and
escape
liability
by
dressing
up
the
taking
as
a
regulation?
now,
mr.
doub
said
that
we
can't
go
behind
the
preamble.
that
is
the
question
--
that
is
the
question,
if
we
can't
go
behind
the
preamble,
we've
got
a
different
case
because
we've
gone
behind
the
preamble,
he
goes
behind
the
preamble
for
85%
of
a
brief
of
110
pages,
we'd
have
a
complete
agreement
in
here,
that
there
was
a
justiable
issue
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
order.
and
i
can't
believe
that
this
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
you
cannot
behind
an
the
executive
order.
i'm
prepared
to
agree
that
the
burden
is
an
onerous
one.
but
to
say
that
you
cannot
--
that
you
can
escape
liability
for
a
taking
by
dressing
it
up
as
a
regulation,
i
can't
believe
that
this
court
will
find
that.
now,
it's
in
point
one
of
our
brief.
we
deal
with
certain
things
that
are
not
what
you
might
call
technical
aspects
of
the
case
but
more
have
to
do
with
the
patriotic
appeal
that
mr.
doub
has
made
and
i
like
to
run
through
them
very
briefly.
they
make
as
much
as
they
can
of
the
fact
that
the
men
who
had
to
do
with
this
order,
particularly
the
president
of
the
united
states,
were
so
purposely
dedicated
to
winning
the
war.
we
don't
dispute
that,
but
in
ex
parte
milligan
justice
david
davis
who
had
been
lincoln's
--
the
administer
of
lincoln's
estate
wrote
to
this
court
when
he
said,
“the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
a
law
for
rulers
and
the
people,
equally
in
war
and
in
peace
and
covers
with
the
shield
of
its
protection
all
classes
of
men
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances.”
we
reject
the
suggestion
that
we
are
unpatriotic
because
we
are
only
asking
to
be
put
in
the
position
we
would
have
been
in
if
a
discriminatory
order
involving
a
taking
had
not
been
issued.
we
insist
that
the
order
was
unique.
that's
gone
into
very
fully
with
particular
reference
to
these
orders
relating
to
passage
of
order
of
appeals
(inaudible)
and
what
not.
they
seek
to
terrify
the
court
by
speaking
of
the
vast
amounts
potentially
involved.
the
amounts
potentially
involved
are
50
suits
estimated
by
them
in
their
brief,
they
have
potential
liabilities
of
$40
million.
it's
a
pure
figment
of
imagination
that
there
can
be
any
other
claims,
and
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
to
suppose
that
this
kind
of
a
procedure
is
ever
going
to
be
followed
again.
it
is
sui
generis
it
seem
to
us
where
you
have
no
regulatory
system
with
respect
to
labor
to
issue
an
order
closing
down
a
business
so
it
will
throw
the
labor
on
the
market
and
maybe
get
them
to
go
elsewhere.
may
i
digress
a
minute
on
that
and
say,
i
said
before
and
i
don't
want
to
get
too
far
on
the
matter
of
the
failure
of
the
order,
but
there
was
a
most
incredible
confusion,
statistical
confusion
until
the
last
minute,
when
the
facts
came
out
they
didn't
weigh
it
all.
and
the
hope
apparently
was
that
the
miners
from
the
homestake
mines
which
is
the
biggest,
by
far
the
biggest
of
all
the
mines
could
be
maneuvered
as
mr.
nelson
said
to
climax
in
colorado
and
to
butte
montana.
the
court
of
claims
specifically
found
that
the
conditions
at
the
mines
were
bad
and
the
wages
--
working
and
living
conditions
were
bad
as
compared
to
what
they
were
in
the
gold
mines.
in
the
case
of,
in
the
case
of
climax
the
mine
was
over
a
11,000
feet
up
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
there
are
certainly
many
in
this
room
who
know
that
middle
aged
men
and
many
of
these
miners
were
middle
aged
men
can't
be
transplanted
or
maneuvered
to
take
up
arduous
physical
labor
at
11,000
feet.
now
what
happened?
the
climax
molybdenum
company
had
a
125
workers
from
the
gold
mines
referred
to
them
and
at
present
according
to
mr.
colder
of
that
company
have
only
10
of
these
workers
on
their
payroll.
this
is
report
of
april
1943.
they
had
60
workers
from
the
gold
mines
come
to
their
mine,
6
of
them
failed
to
pass
the
physical
examination
and
44
of
them
had
since
quit
working
for
this
company.
that
is
to
say
60
came
there,
six
failed
to
pass
a
physical
--
that
brought
the
number
down
to
54,
you
have
special
physicals
for
(inaudible)
to
the
operations,
44
quit
and
you
got
down
to
10.
i
think
the,
i
think
the
thing
i
want
to
emphasize
more,
most
of
all
is
the
fact
that
these
general
observations
about
war
losses
do
not
apply
to
this
particular
very
special
episode.
now
i,
the
government
relies
on
the
caltex
case
i
feel
that
there
are
two
that
--
the
statement
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
caltex
case
which
is
extremely
pertinent
and
consistent
with
what
this
court
has
held
generally.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
with
the
concurrence
of
mr.
justice
black
it
seems
to
me
that
the
guiding
principle
should
be
this,
whenever
the
government
determines
that
one
person's
property
whatever
it
maybe
is
essential
to
the
war
effort
and
appropriates
for
the
common
good,
the
public
first
rather
the
individual
should
bear
the
loss.
now
i
want
to
emphasize
that
whereas
we
do
not
yield
to
anyone
in
our
appreciation
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
that
existed
during
1942,
nevertheless
what
was
done
here
was
done
as
a
result
of
the
suggestion
that
was
made
in
july
1942.
there
wasn't
anything
remotely
approaching
the
situation
that
existed
in
caltex.
there
wasn't
anything
remotely
approaching
the
situation
that
existed
on
the
west
coast
next
to
the
japanese.
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
find
the
facts,
plenty
of
time
to
decide,
to
respect
the
law,
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
wait
and
either
have
a
statute
for
the
general
regulation
of
labor
or
to
let
the
gold
mine
continue
and
deal
with
the
problem
of
labor
as
it
was
dealt
with
in
other
areas.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
couldn't
quite
hear
you
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
on
the
floor
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
don't
have
any
knowledge
of
any
discussion.
i
think
that
the
government's
brief
said
there
was
none,
there
were
reports.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
you
understand
your
honor
that
we
are
not
dependent
upon
that
act?
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
secondarily.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
no
sir.
i
would
have
challenged
it
if
hasn't
been
ratified
by
the
president.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
accept
it
as
an
order
that
had
to
be
obeyed
and
amounted
to
a
taking.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
don't
accept
it
as
an
order,
as
a
priorities
order
or
an
allocation
order.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
think
that
if
we
had
won
suite
there
in
effect
to
restrain
the
order,
the
government
could
have
said
that
under
title
2
of
the
second
war
powers
act
the
president
had
the
power
to
take
any
interest
in
property
he
chose
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
the
preamble
was
camouflaged
as
we
see
it.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
our
conception
that
there
was
a
taking
i
think
depends
upon
the
order
being
valid
or
the
order
being
--
or
the
government
being
estopped
and
challenging
the
validity
of
it.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i
think
your
honor
in
the
--
in
(inaudible)
opinion
indicated
some
reservation
on
that
point.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
exactly
we
argue
its
validity
at
great
length.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
indeed
it's
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i
appreciate
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i'm
not
--
very
definitely
not,
and
with
the
section
--
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
because
they
seek
to
give
the
impression
that
the
order
was
a
regulation
with
pertaining
to
critical
materials,
machinery
and
equipment,
and
much
of
what
mr.
doub
said
on
his
original
presentation
and
he
asked
me
more
of
what
is
brief,
is
pertinent
only
if
that's
what
it
really
was.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
precisely.
mr.
campbell
calls
my
attention
to
the
–
(inaudible)
remind
me
of,
to
be
sure
that
i
don't
forget
it,
although
i
don't
want
to
exaggerate
its
importance.
in
our
discussion
of
the
special
jurisdictional
act,
inadvertently
we
omitted
to
cite
a
case,
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
petition
of
certiorari.
i
mentioned
that
to
mr.
doub
yesterday,
so
that
he
wouldn't
be
taken
completely
by
surprise,
and
i
ask
leave
simply
to
mention
the
name
and
give
the
citation
in
the
case
and
refer
to
it
very
briefly.
it
was
referred
to
on
page
five
of
our
brief
and
opposition
to
certiorari
in
note
three,
and
the
name
of
it
is
brinker-johnson
and
company
against
reconstruction
finance
corporation,
236
f.2d
195.
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
perhaps
i
can
very
briefly
summarize
it
by
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
there
held
that
the
--
not
in
the
suit
on
the
special
jurisdictional
act,
but
in
the
suit
involving
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation,
the
court
of
appeals
held
or
said
that
enacting
public
law
532,
the
congress
fully
appreciated
the
hardship
caused
by
l208.
congress
elected
to
recompense
any
operator
of
a
gold
mine
or
gold
plus
operation,
for
all
losses
caused
by
the
order,
that
provided
a
mechanism
to
that
end.
now
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
didn't
discuss
it
in
the
brief,
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
cite
it
to
the
court,
and
ask
the
court
if
convenient
if
they
would
take
a
look
at
it.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
except
for
my
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
that's
entirely
correct.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well
i
think
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
the
word
jurisdictional
as
used
with
reference
to
that
kind
of
a
statute,
really
means
the
grant
by
the
congress
to
a
court
of
authority,
to
award
a
judgment
for
dollars.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
well,
that
is
language
that
the
word
jurisdiction
is
the
language
which
has
been
classically
used
by
the
congress
in
cases
where
they
have
created
cause
of
action,
in
cases
where
they
haven't
done.
but
they
merely
eliminated
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
think
that's
an
arguable
point
your
honor,
i
have
to
say
in
honestly,
i
think
that's
an
arguable
point.
we've
argued
it
and
the
other
side
is
arguing
the
other
side
of
it.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
very
definitely.
but
i
wouldn't
be
frank
with
the
court
if
i
said
that
i
thought
that
the
government's
position
on
that
was
trivial.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i'm
sorry
i
just
noticed
that
my
mic
was
out,
and
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
the
question.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
bourne
i
agree
with
that
completely
and
i
think
that,
that
aspect
of
the
case
your
honors
will
find
is
fully
covered
in
our
brief
and
now
in
the
reply
brief
it
was
not
taken
up
initially
in
the
government's
initial
brief,
very
logically
because
they
didn't
know
to
what
extent
we
were
going
rely
on
it,
but
they
cover
it
in
their
reply
brief.
and
i
think
you
find
the
discussion
(inaudible)
