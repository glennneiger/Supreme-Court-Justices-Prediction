(inaudible)

john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
am
asking
you
if
you
eliminate
from
this
order
the
first
condition
and
the
(inaudible)
requiring
closing
down
could
the
companies
or
any
of
them
that
continue
to
operate
despite
the
restrictions
on
their
materials
and
procurement
requirements.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
to
clarify
my
own
mind?
are
you
asking
us
to
reverse
the
findings
of
the
court
of
claims
or
are
you
contending
that
on
the
basis
of
those
findings,
you're
nonetheless
entitled
to
a
reversal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
second?
justice
john
m.
harlan
surely
the
court
of
claims
is
entitled
to
look
at
what
purports
to
be
something
other
than
the
taking
and
to
say
in
legal
effect
it
was
taking?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
legal
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
everything
you
said,
excuse
me
â€“
everything
you
said
up
today
as
i
understand
it,
it
stands
quite
independently
of
the
special
jurisdictional
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
your
position
is
that
you
can
ignore
that
act
and
you're
still
entitled
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
statute,
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
is
this
statute
susceptible
of
the
construction
of
it's
only
purpose
was
to
eliminate
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you
draw
some
sustenance
out
of
the
statute,
is
the
secondary
string
to
your
bow
which
goes
beyond
