was
this,
was
this,
is
this
--
this
was
a
special
jurisdictional
act,
was
it,
the
reference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
gold
mine
claims
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
has
been
no
other
special
jurisdictional
act
going
out
of
or
industries
board
orders.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
pandora's
box
evidently
congress
sought
it
that
it
is
only
--
evidently
can't
resort
there
was
a
problem,
i
am
not
saying
they
indicated
any
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
something
â€“
there
was
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
compensation
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
this
mr.
doub
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this,
there
have
been
other
jurisdictional
statutes
like
this
in
which
there
was
controversy
about
court
taking
and
the
--
or
private
bills
introduced,
and
i
think
after
the
first
world
war,
after
civil
war
too,
and
congress
then
passed
acts
referring
the
matter,
i
am
purposely
using
a
vague
phrase,
referring
the
matter
for
determination
by
the
court
of
claims.
my
question
is
this,
in
other
cognate
or
similar
statute
dealing
with
this
general
problem
of
making
good
loss
incurred
through
governmental
inference
at
time
of
war,
is
this
the
stock
phrase
which
to
me
it
raises
problems
which
justice
whittaker
question
implied
as
to
my
hearing
is
this
the
stock
phrase
because
for
losses
incurred
because
of
the
closing
or
curtailment
or
prevention
of
operation,
as
a
result
of
the
restrictions
imposed,
that
as
justice
whittaker
question
just
indicated
hardly
the
language
for
asking
ascertainment
whether
there
was
taking,
and
i
want
to
know
whether
you've
made
a
profit
or
you've
made
--
had
a
study
made
of
commonly
similar
authorizing
statutes
to
find
out
--
imposing
upon
the
court
of
claims,
the
jurisdiction
of
determining
lawsuit
as
a
result
of
a
restriction,
what
does
that
mean,
what
is
the
legal
criteria
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
congress
has
thereby
imposed
upon
the
court
of
claims
because
to
repeat,
it
is
hardly
the
language
of
ascertaining
whether
there
was
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
a
lot
of
those
statues
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
correct
me,
but
not
a
lot,
some
of
those
statutes
are
referenced
to
the
court
of
claims,
specifically
refer
a
claim
by
the
abc
company,
isn't
that
true?
it
just
says,
would
you
please
pass
on
the
claim
of
so
and
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
i
should
think
the
particular
wording
of
this
statute,
provokes
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
to
what
it
is
that
the
court
of
claims
was
asked
to
do
and
if
they
didn't
raise
a
question,
whether
this
was
a
judicial
reference
which
alone
is
capable
of
being
reviewed
here
under
the
case
or
controversy
or
whether
it
was
a
santa
clause
reference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
your
brief
or
of
the
other
side's
brief,
what
does
the
report
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
to
state
on
what
legal
ground
you're
standing
here
or
grounds
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
one
ground
for
standing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
special
jurisdictional
act
is
based
on
what
criterion
for
judgment
by
the
court
of
claims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
hold
your
judgment
here
on
any
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
hold
the
judgment
here
on
any
ground
and
he
could?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
in
your
brief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
my
question
mr.
bourne
that
if
you
--
if
you
are
restricted
if
one
is
confined
to,
if
one
rejects
the
taking
argument
and
is
confined
to
the
jurisdictional
statute,
the
basis
for
judge
that
this
a
reference
to
the
court
of
claims
which
the
congress
may
make
as
a
matter
of
grace
it
may
give
you
that
but
if
it
isn't
the
nature
of
what
is
a
case
or
controversy
you
can't
review
it.
you
would
--
practically
that
will
be
all
right
for
you,
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
instance
like
the
indian
--
there
is
an
indian
statute
in
which
congress
allows
the
commission
or
in
other
words
give
justice
to
make
determinations
as
a
matter
of
equity,
well
as
matter
of
equity
in
that
thing
doesn't
mean
chancery
equity
in
a
practical
sense.
in
other
words,
congress
means
that
the
commission
as
an
agent
for
determining
whether
it
will
give
a
(inaudible)
to
somebody
instead
of
using
a
committee
of
congress
and
if
it
does
that
then
we
can't
review
it,
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
certainly,
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bourne
i'm
sorry
to
--
but
i
have
to
interrupt
you
for
parity
sake.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
course
of
your
argument,
like
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
in
idaho
on
the
demurral,
seems
to
me
to
be
an
argument
or
a
claim
not
of
a
taking,
but
of
a
challenge
of
the
exercise
of
the
power
by
the
board,
so
unjustifiable,
so
basic,
as
to
constitute
a
taking
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
what
it
then
goes
on
to
say,
having
been
that
it
was
a
taking,
but
from
the
point
of
analysis,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
taking
for
which
compensation
is
to
be
given,
and
therefore
it
does
seem
to
me
to
make
an
important
difference
whether
this
is
a
review
authorized
by
congress
of
what
although
not
a
taking,
is
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
claims
which
has
no
power
to
pass
on
a
tort
claim,
except
and
unless
the
congress
authorizes
it
to
make
such
a
determination.
everything
you've
said
and
everything
that
the
--
as
i
have
now
just
read
for
the
first
time,
the
idaho
maryland
mining
company
case
goes
to
the
proposition
that
this
was
baseless,
this
had
no
warrant
in
the
exigencies
of
a
war,
giving
every
breath
of
decretory
power
to
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
essential,
you
happen
to
have
authority
implied
not
as
a
matter
of
fiction,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
read
--
would
you
be
if
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
passed
a
statute
forbidding
the
mining
of
gold
during
the
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
fair
question,
what
i
hope
was
a
fair
--
i
hope
it's
a
fair
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bourne
may
i
ask
this
question?
leave
out
paragraph
one
if
it
is
paragraph
one,
shut
down
paragraph,
could
the,
could
the
wpd
have
issued
an
order
to
strangle
this
industry
by
provisions
dealing
with
materials
whatever
or
whatever
other
means
it
had
of
affecting
industrial
production,
restrictions,
could
it,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
brings
me
really,
it
as
i
understood
your
argument
is
that
that
was
accomplished
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
lawyers
don't
as
a
matter
of
cause
to
know
elegant
or
even
thoughtlessness
on
its
code
of
british
empire
as
a
result
of
thoughtlessness
that
england
required
a
colony
(inaudible)
lack
of
thought
and
we
write
things
without
thinking
hard
enough,
but
i
like
to
know
why
if
they
could
have
accomplished
the
shut
down
of
this
industry,
why
did
they
make
an
exception
as
to
this
industry
or
this
curtailment
by
putting
in
the
explicit
shut
down
provision.
is
there
any
light
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
reached
the
conclusion
and
i
am
putting
an
enquiry
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
the
chief
judge
that
he
concurred
in
the
idaho
case
i
don't
understand
i
could
concur
with
that
opinion
and
then
dissent
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
is
i
am
right,
am
i
--
this
is
the
only
industry
in
which
there
was
such
a
clause
wanted,
is
that
what
it's
called.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
throughout
the
years
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
say
that
there
is
in
the
record,
evidence
or
whatever
it
is
indicating
that
they
thought
of
doing
it
by
what
i
call
strangulation
and
for
one
reason
or
other
didn't
do
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
order,
if
the
order
were
claimed
to
be
invalid
then
it
couldn't
be
interpreted
as
an
authorization
of
taking
and
before
the
united
states
can
be
sued
for
a
taking,
there
must
be
some
authorization
by
an
appropriate
governmental
authority.
there
might
be
a
tort,
an
officer,
an
employee
of
the
government
may
on
his
--
may
on
(inaudible)
of
his
own
destroy
property,
but
he
could
be
authorized
to
take,
and
yet
he
is
authorized,
and
therefore
you
come
in
under
a
taking
the
order
must
be
deemed
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
was
that
you
wouldn't
challenge
it,
you
would
say
that
the
mass
of
regulation
by
the
wpb,
cutting
down
the
critical
materials,
limiting
processes,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
you
would
say
--
you
do
say
that
that
is
not,
those
did
not
constitute
taking,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
this
were
that,
then
you
would
say
it
comes
under
the
general
regulatory
power,
the
wpb
to
control,
to
regulate
the
economic
property
and
economic
(inaudible)
of
the
labor
courts
of
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
order,
i'm
not
suggesting
remotely
that
i
think
you're
right
or
wrong,
what
you're
saying
is
that
under
the
pretense
of
being
an
allocation
order,
in
fact
there
was
what
you
say
is
a
constitutionally
authorized
taking?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
position
is
--
your
position
is
however
that
you
lean
on
that
act
if
you
have
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
somebody
had
to
do
something
with
words
used
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
defining
the
subject
matter
which
it
is
now,
for
which
it
is
now
giving
authority
to
the
court
of
claims
to
pass
on
and
the
question
is
what
is
it
that
the
court
of
claims
is
allowed
to
pass
on
with
complete
indifference
to
statute
of
limitations,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
very
often
gives
to
the
court
of
claims,
authority
beyond
the
existing
the
original
omnibus
court
of
claims
act,
and
in
those
enactments,
it
formulates
variously,
what
it
is
that
the
court
of
claims
is
thereafter
authorized
to
pass
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
times
it
merely
says
in
a
specific
case
the
statute
of
limitation
is
not
to
be
deemed
statement,
in
other
instances
it
says
some
other
defense
or
it
says
comprehension,
no
defense
that
could
have
been
raised
shall
be
allowed,
in
other
instances
it
tells
what
it
is,
as
in
the
case
of
the
indian
statute,
it
says
the
court
of
claims
should
be
a
grand
daddy,
and
give
them
whatever
they
think
is
nice
and
fair,
and
we
have
to
decide
what
this
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
hear
that
kind
of
an
argument
often
as
to
what
a
failure
of
a
bill
means,
for
me
it
always
means
nothing.
i
think
an
amendment
that's
rejected
means
something,
but
congressmen
today
i
suppose
had
put
into
the
hopper
a
thousand
bills
or
maybe
more
in
this
notion
that
because
a
bill
remains
in
the
hopper
it
means
something,
seems
to
me
a
very
great
strain
on
one's
reasoning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
spoken
too
quickly.
did
i
understand
that
the
bills,
the
first
bill
which
you
mentioned
which
i
made
a
comment
went
through
a
vote
and
rejected
affirmatively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
make
a
very
great
difference,
if
actually
congress
votes
something
down
i
was
talking
about
introducing
bills
and
finding
great
significance
that
has
never
came
to
a
vote.
i
never
was
in
the
congress
but
i
know
that
means
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
that's
an
advantage
of
not
having
been
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
that
mean,
does
it
mean
that
it
was
discussed
and
voted
upon,
or
does
it
mean
that
it
never
was
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
thousand
bills
i
repeat
that
are
introduced
today
that
doesn't
pass,
because
nobody
takes
them
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
the
government
wouldn't
come
here
next
week
and
say
what
i
have
just
said
is
so.
i
heard
the
government
often
say
that
merely
an
introduction
of
a
bill
â€“
they
have
no
significance
on
the
construction
of
some
other
bill
that
did
pass.
