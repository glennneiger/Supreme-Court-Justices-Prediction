mr.
george
cochran
doub
if
the
court
please.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
a
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
holding
that
a
wartime
order
of
the
war
production
board
took
private
property
for
public
use
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
order
involved
was
issued
by
the
war
production
board
10
months
after
this
country
entered
the
war
in
october
1942
as
part
of
the
effective
mobilization
of
our
industry
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
and
is
known
as
order
l-208.
it
remained
in
effect
until
june
1945.
so
it
was
in
effect
for
something
over
two
and
half
years.
the
order
required
all
gold
mines
classified
as
unnecessary
or
rather
nonessential
to
this
country's
war
effort
to
be
closed
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
it
prohibited
them
from
acquiring,
consuming
or
using
any
material
facility
or
equipment
for
mining
purposes
except
minimum
amounts
for
maintenance.
the
essential
question
then
is
whether
the
order
should
be
deemed
a
non-compensable
temporary
restriction
upon
a
business
or
from
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
private
property
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
or
as
the
court
of
claims,
the
undertaking
of
private
property
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
i
might
say
these
respondents
complied
with
the
order.
they
suspended
their
mining
operations
and
i'm
--
they
made
no
attempt
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
order
by
affirmative
or
negative
legal
proceedings.
these
suits
were
brought
in
the
court
of
claims
under
a
special
reference
statute
passed
by
congress
in
1952
which
conferred
upon
the
court
jurisdiction
to
hear
and
determine
the
claims
in
question
and
waiving
any
statute
of
limitations
or
latches.
in
the
second
war
powers
act
of
congress
in
1940,
congress
provided
that
in
the
interest
of
national
defense,
the
president
might
allocate
the
supply
of
any
material
or
any
facilities
for
defense
or
for
private
account
or
for
export
“upon
such
conditions
and
to
such
extent
as
he
shall
deem
necessary
or
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
and
to
promote
the
national
defense”.
now,
that
was
a
broad
comprehensive
draft
of
congressional
power
to
the
president.
and
the
president,
by
a
series
of
executive
orders,
delegated
that
power
to
the
war
production
board
which
was
composed
of
donald
nelson
as
chairman,
the
secretary
of
war,
secretary
of
navy,
other
cabinet
officers.
john
lord
o'brian
was
the
distinguished
general
counsel.
now,
this
was
the
board
that
was
exercising
that
statutory
power
of
the
president.
and
it
was
that
board
which
converted
a
laissez
faire,
free
economy
into
a
regulated
economy
with
speed
and
efficiency
to
an
extraordinary
extent.
it
converted
our
economy
from
a
peace
to
a
wartime
basis.
now,
how
did
it
do
this?
regulation
was
primarily
through
thousands
of
priority
orders,
material
conservation
orders
and
orders
limiting,
curtailing
or
prohibiting
the
--
the
production
of
nonessential
products
and
restricting
the
use
of
critical
war
materials.
so
through
this
wpb
regulation,
raw
materials,
machine
tools,
machinery
and
equipment
were
channeled
in
nonessential
users
to
essential
users.
the
war
production
board
issued
so-called
the
l
orders
of
which
this
was
one
and
thousands
of
other
type
orders
which
resulted
in
severe
financial
losses
to
enumerable
businesses.
by
l
orders,
the
war
production
board
stopped
the
manufacturer,
passenger
automobiles,
stoves,
refrigerators,
office
equipment,
bar
graphs,
vending
machine,
metal
household,
furniture
and
other
metal
commodities.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it
was
all
done
as
a
war
necessity.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
yes,
i
--
i
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
other
order
directed
in
explicit
terms.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
--
shutdown
of
a
business.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
--
and
this
one
did.
but
the
--
all
these
other
orders,
in
many
cases,
did
forbid
the
--
an
industry
from
consuming
or
using
any
materials
which
had
the
same
effect.
and
i
might
say
that
paragraph
(2)
of
this
order
forbad
the
gold
mines
from
consuming
or
using
any
materials
and
that
would
have
resulted
in
suspending
gold
mining
operations
without
the
first
paragraph
of
the
order.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
was
the
result
of
these
orders
regardless
of
technical
form.
in
may
of
1942,
the
war
production
board
predicted
that
within
six
months
as
the
result
of
their
orders,
24,000
manufacturing
businesses
would
have
to
close.
now,
what
the
actual
consequences
were
of
these
orders,
if
the
court
please,
we
don't
know.
but
we
do
know
that
in
the
years
1942
through
1944,
the
total
business
concerns
in
the
united
states
excluding
real
estate
and
insurance,
such
things,
declined
by
201,000.
and
it's
certainly
fair
to
assume
that
a
material
part
of
that
decline
was
attributable
to
this
wartime
regulation
of
the
war
production
board.
i'd
like
to
point
out
what
mr.o'brian
said
in
his
classic
article
on
the
functioning
of
the
war
production
board
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
placed
the
limit
–
from
production
of
articles
stating
an
industry
could
only
produce
25%
of
what
it
had
produced
before,
but
many
of
them
were
prohibitory
and
prohibited
the
manufacture
of
articles
whether
bicycles,
stoves
or
gold
mining.
this
is
what
john
lord
o'brian
said
in
his
article
in
13th
george
washington
law
review
as
to
these
l
orders.
“early
in
1942
there
issued
a
group
of
limitation
orders,
the
l
series
which
in
the
space
of
a
few
months
completely
converted
american
industry
from
a
peace
time
to
a
war
time
economy.
it
is
doubtful
of
any
serious
of
legislative
or
executive
orders
in
this
country
ever
produced
a
more
far
reaching
change
in
so
short
of
time.”
now
it's
a
tribute
to
that
board
and
its
general
counsel
that
their
orders
and
procedures
were
so
well
and
fairly
handled
that
prior
to
this
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
not
a
single
order
of
the
war
production
board
was
ever
invalidated
by
any
court.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
no
not
all.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
not
at
all.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
because
the
second
paragraph
of
the
order
forbade
them
“from
consuming
or
using
any
materials
in
the
production
of
gold.”
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
i
thought
you
were
talking,
addressing
yourself
to
the
first
provision
of
the
order
oh,
no
i
would
say
--
you
mean
if
there
had
been
no
orders?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
then
if
you
--
forget
the
first
provision
and
then
forget
the
second
provision
that
i
mentioned,
i
think
they
could
have
continued.
now
there
had
been
some
prior
restrictions
that
they
were
suffering,
living
with
prior
to
this
order
that
had
cut
their
production,
i
don't
recall
the
number
of
tons
but
i
know
the
labor
force
had
been
reduced
over
a
period
of
the
first
six
months
of
1942
or
rather
down
to
october
'42
it
had
already
been
reduced
quite
materially.
but
the
effect
of
this
order
was
to
reduce
it
by
19000
men
to
6500
and
i
think
it
had
been
up
to
about
25000.
they
could
have,
they
could
have
continued
yes
and
they
undoubtedly
will
continue
consuming
critical
manpower
and
consuming
critical
materials
desperately
needed
elsewhere
for
our
war
effort,
but
i'll
come
to
that,
i'll
say
more
on
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
--
under
that
order?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
there
is
a
--
he
wouldn't
have
fallen
within
the
scope
of
this
order.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
he
could
have
worked
that,
yes.
now
not
a
single
business
before
coming
down
to
this
order
i
want
to
talk
generally
for
a
few
more
minutes
about
what
the
war
production
board
did,
now
not
a
single
business
in
the
united
states
prejudiced
by
these
other
orders
obtained
any
compensation
for
their
lawsuits.
for
example
in
st.
regis
paper
company
case
and
it
had
a
loss
of
$3
million
because
of
an
order
prohibiting
the
consumption
of
pulp
wood
by
any
paper
company
in
a
certain
geographical
area.
and
that
prevented
its
plants
from
obtained
pulp
order
and
the
court
of
claims
held
the
order
was
a
valid
war
time
regulation
under
the
statutory
power
to
allocate
materials
and
facilities
and
was
not
a
taking
of
private
property
and
you
denied
certiorari.
and
then
in
orofino
case,
the
court
of
claims
was
dealing
with
this
very
order
l-208
which
shut
down,
had
the
effect
of
shutting
down
the
orofino
gold
mines.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
the
court
of
claims
attempted
to
distinguish
it
mr.
justice
douglas
on
the
ground
that
a
more
complete
record
had
been
made
in
this
case
by
the
respondents
which
you
find
in
this
monstrous
record
includes
all
the
records
of
the
war
production
board.
you
find
in
the
orofino
case
the
members
of
the
court
of
claims
were
unanimous
in
holding
that
was
no
taking
of
private
property.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
i
think
they
overruled
it.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
but
you'll
open
up
pandora's
box
because
everyone
that
owned
private
property
or
private
business
had
suffered
injury
during
the
war,
will
come
into
congress
asking
for
special
legislation
and
they
certainly
would
be
entitled
to
it
because
as
i
propose
to
show
this
industry
which
is
one
of
the
--
because
gold
happens
to
be
effective
for
the
public
interest
and
is
the
last,
not
the
first
industry
to
be
given
and
singled
out
this
unique
preferred
treatment.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
would
have
to
be
a
matter
of
grace,
there
is
no
way
they
could
recover
now.
now
why
was
limitation--?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
your
honor
no
statute
is
passed
until
the
court
of
claims
on
the
pleadings
in
denying
a
motion
of
the
united
states
to
dismiss
this
compliant,
the
court
of
claims
reversed
itself.
the
orofino
case
and
said
the
plaintiffs
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
and
it
stated
a
case
of
a
taking
if
they
could
sustain
the
allegations
of
their
complaints.
then
congress
passed
this
special
act
because
they
are
great
--
there
were
many
gold
mining
companies
who
hadn't
brought
any
suits.
they
didn't
think
there
was
any,
they
had
a
case
and
obviously
if
idaho
maryland
mines
had
a
cause
of
action,
every
other
gold
company
within
its
order
had
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
there
are
150
cases
in
the
court
of
claims
now
and
i
think
the
amounts
claimed
aggregate
about
50
million.
now
why
did
the
war
production
board
issue
this
drastic
order?
in
the
summer
of
1942,
the
shortage
of
labor
in
the
non-ferrous
metal
mines
for
copper,
lead
and
zinc
had
reached
such
a
point
that
the
inadequate
production
of
essential
materials
had
become
a
threat
to
the
entire
war
effort.
sources
of
large
supplies
of
alloy
materials
like
chrome
and
manganese
had
been
cut
off
by
enemy
action.
mining
equipment
was
pitiably
short
of
our
requirements
in
these
copper
mines
and
lead
mines
and
yet
the
success
of
our
whole
armament
program
depended
upon
the
increased
production
of
raw
material
such
as
copper,
lead
and
zinc.
there
were
not
enough
miners
in
the
non-ferrous
metal
mines.
six
thousand
of
them
had
pulled
out
and
gone
to
the
shipyard
and
other
war
industries
offering
higher
wages,
others
had
been
drafted
into
the
armed
services
and
as
secretary
forrestal
said,
the
gold
miners
constitute
the
last
reservoir
of
skilled
mining
labor
in
this
country.
now
it
was
reported
to
the
war
production
board
in
september,
that
the
loss
of
another
5,000
or
6,000
workers
in
the
copper
mines
might
so
prejudice
fabricating
processes
that
100,000
workers
in
war
plants
would
be
affected.
and
in
july
1942,
the
production
of
copper
had
dropped
by
1,000
tones.
now,
this
order
was
issued
on
october
6,
1942.
the
memorandum
to
the
war
production
board,
of
one
of
its
bureaus,
september
9,
1942
estimated
that
sizeable
amounts
of
critical
materials
would
be
saved
in
closing
the
gold
mines.
in
one
year
they
had
spent
$17
million
on
materials
and
supplies,
$7
million
for
fuel
and
electricity.
another
memorandum,
two
days
later
develops
that
whole
business
of
the
conservation
of
materials.
a
report
for
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
at
which
this
order
with
issued,
and
it
had
been
under
discussion
for
a
month
or
more.
it
was
recommended
by
under
secretary
rob
patterson,
under
secretary
the
navy
forrestal.
patterson
said
the
situation
was
so
alarming
as
to
the
shortage
of
miners
and
the
production
of
copper,
the
army
was
about
to
call
our
soldiers
to
go
back
and
work
in
the
copper
mines.
he
said
this
is
a
hard
step
for
the
army
to
take,
but
the
effect
of
this
step
and
others
will
not
give
complete
relief
if
nothing
is
done
to
transfer
gold
miners
to
copper
mines.
now
the
minutes
of
this
meeting
when
the
order
was
issued,
refers
exclusively
to
the
necessity
of
closing
the
gold
mines
in
order,
in
the
hope
and
belief
and
expectation
that
its
miners
would
go
to
the
non-ferrous
metal
mines,
where
they
were
desperately
needed.
i
might
say
that
the
government
had
no
power
to
draft
men
to
work
in
mines
or
to
make
them
work
anywhere
they
didn't
want
to
work.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it's
the
second.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it's
the
second.
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
testimony
in
this
case
is
undisputed.
there
is
no
controversy
as
to
facts.
their
only
argument
here
is
whether
the
respondents
are
entitled
to
go
behind
the
face
of
the
order
and
assert
as
they
do
assert
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
order
was
to
bring
about
a
transfer
of
these
skilled
miners
from
the
gold
fields
up
to
the
copper
mines,
and
that's
not
important
in
our
view
of
the
matter.
the
court
of
claims
said
the
paramount
purpose
was
to
do
that.
we
think
undoubtedly
a
major
purpose
was
to
do
it.
we
don't
think
it's
important,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court
of
claims,
we
don't
think
the
court
of
claims
had
any
power
to
do
what
they
did
in
this
case.
they
proceeded
to
say
this,
15
years
after
this
order
and
after
the
war,
they
proceeded
to
review
and
evaluate
the
wisdom
of
this
executive
action.
they
concluded
that
l208
“was
not
in
fact
necessary
to
the
successful
prosecution
of
the
war.”
it
was
not
devised
for
the
purpose
of
conserving
or
allocating
materials,
but
it
was
ill
conceived,
unwise
and
unsuccessful,
thus
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
executive,
and
all
that
in
violation
of
established
limits
of
judicial
inquiry
into
legislative
and
executive
action.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
don't
know
whether
--
no.
i
say
it's
purely
a
question
of
law
as
it
made
the
judiciary
proceed
to
express
its
--
such
views
as
those,
i
say
no.
you
said
--
this
court
said
time
and
again,
you
will
never
express
such
views
as
the
action
of
the
executive
and
i
think
properly
so.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
i
think
they
are
a
perfectly
a
relevant
conclusion.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
order
was
successful
or
not.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
many
men
actually
transferred
to
the
metal
mines.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
hopes
and
expectations
of
secretary
rob
patterson
and
forrestal
in
the
army,
and
the
president
would
realize
or
not.
actually
i'll
show
that
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
of
course
your
honor,
that's
what
i'm
coming
to,
i'm
coming
to
legal
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
legal
conclusion
and
i'll
show
you
why
it
was
not
a
taking.
it
wasn't
a
taking
under
any
decisions
of
this
court.
it
wasn't
a
taking
as
a
matter
of
social
justice
and
it
wasn't
a
taking
under,
i
think
any
modern
philosophy
of
private
property.
i
might
say
this,
that
the
court
also
placed
its
opinion
on
highly
technical
grounds.
they
said
this
that
l208
exceeded
permissible
regulation
because
no
provision
was
included
that
machinery
and
equipment
and
material
made
idle
would
be
held
for
the
use
of
the
government,
and
the
l208
did
not
require
that
the
owners
deliver
their
material
to
essential
users.
the
court
of
claims
reasoned
then
that
l208
didn't
go
too
far,
that
it
didn't
go
far
enough.
that
if
it
had
contained
such
a
provision
as
they
complain
about,
it
would
have
been
a
valid
regulation
and
yet
they
overlooked
the
fact
that
by
amendments
in
november
of
1942,
this
act,
the
war
production
board
had
included
the
very
provisions
that
they
complained
were
in
the
order.
now,
why
do
we
submit
that
this
is
a
--
not
a
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use?
for
instance,
we
say
you
do
not
have
the
necessary
elements
of
a
constitutional
taking
for
it.
there
was
no
acquisition
of
property.
the
united
states
didn't
seize
the
gold
mines.
this
isn't
a
pewee
coal
case
or
a
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
case.
we
didn't
occupy
the
property.
we
didn't
take
possession
of
the
mines.
they
were
--
we
took
no
gold.
there
was
as
much
gold
when
that
order
was
lifted,
as
when
it
went
into
effect.
there
was
then
but
a
temporary
and
consequential
diminution
of
value,
and
we
say
as
a
result
of
this
regulation,
but
the
government
didn't
dispossess
the
respondents
of
title
or
possession.
we
didn't
appropriate
any
tangible
personal
property
either
or
dispossess
them
of
that.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
they
have
never
gotten
the
question
of
damages,
so
that's
not
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
that
wasn't
discussed
mr.
justice
brennan.
so
if
everyone
of
the
cases
today,
where
there's
been
a
recovery
for
a
taking
of
property
under
the
fifth
amendment,
there
has
been
a
physical
seizure,
a
physical
occupation,
a
physical
taking,
if
not
of
entire
entries,
at
least
of
some
entries.
for
example,
there
are
cases
like
inadvertent
flooding
of
property,
the
dickinson
and
cress
cases,
but
that
was
a
taking,
that
was
a
physical
invasion
of
the
property,
low
flights
of
government
aircraft,
destroying
use,
that
was
a
taking
of
a
servitude,
imposition
of
a
physical
servitude
upon
the
property,
destroying
use
by
firing
projectiles
over
the
property,
portsmouth
case,
that
was
a
physical
servitude.
so,
what
are
we
dealing
with
here?
we're
dealing
with
a
regulation
not
directed
to
one
or
two
companies
but
it
covered
in
its
scope
the
entire
continental
united
states
and
alaska.
it
covered
all
gold
mining
companies
within
its
terms.
it
fell
upon
the
just
and
the
unjust.
it
was
published
in
the
federal
register,
there
was
no
discrimination,
there
was
no
inequality,
and
it
affected
did
not
a
few
companies
but
affected
252,
entire
industry.
now
we
say
there
was
no
taking
of
properties.
as
justice
holmes
said
in
truax
against
corrigan,
“delusive
exactness
is
a
source
of
fallacy
throughout
the
law
by
calling
a
business
property
you
make
it
same
like
land,
nothing
on
more
deprecate
than
the
use
of
the
constitution
to
prevent
the
making
of
social
experiments
though
few
are
even
of
obnoxious
to
me.”
and
cardozo
said,
“property
like
liberty
has
been
taught
that
some
of
its
most
cherished
immunities
are
not
absolute,
but
relative.
that
the
owner
of
land
might
find
himself
restricted
in
emergencies
as
a
means
to
social
justice.
zoning
laws
we
prohibit
use,
certain
kinds
of
use
which
may
add
up
to
the
value
of
the
property
almost
and
there
is
not
even
an
emergency
involved
and
it
is
done
not
temporarily
in
war
time
but
on
a
permanent
basis.”
in
nebbia
against
new
york
you
will
find
that
this
court
gave
the
most
careful
and
comprehensive
consideration
of
property
rights
that
you'll
find
in
any
of
the
cases.
and
you
said
this,
neither
property
rights
nor
contracts
rights
are
absolute
for
government
cannot
exist
if
the
citizen
may
at
will
to
use
his
property
to
the
determent
of
his
fellows.
the
court
has,
you
said
this,
the
court
has
repeatedly
sustained
the
curtailment
of
enjoyment
of
private
property
in
the
public
interest.
the
owners'
rights
maybe
subordinated
to
the
needs
of
other
private
owners
whose
pursuits
are
vital
to
the
paramount
interest
of
the
community.
now
here
you
had
a
case
where
an
industry
wasn't
merely
unnecessary
to
the
war
effort
but
it
was
obstructing
the
war
effort
by
burning
up
and
consuming
critical
manpower
and
material
desperately
needed
for
our
national
safety.
and
their
product
gold
was
as
immaterial
to
that
war
effort
as
if
they
had
been
producing
snowballs
or
nothing
at
all.
now
they
say
this
is
a
taking
because
you
prohibited
our
use.
well
it
wasn't
a
taking
when
we
prohibited
liquor
and
even
near
beer
during
the
first
world
war
as
a
war
measure.
it
wasn't
a
taking
when
state
say
prohibited
a
healthy
nutritious
substance
only
a
modorum
inherently
that
have
helped
them.
it
wasn't
of
taking
when
states
have
prohibited
the
production
of
petroleum
like
constituted
waste,
champlin
refining
company
and
this
was
waste.
judge
magruder
pointed
out
in
wilson
against
brown
that
in
the
regulatory
field
the
power
of
imminent
domain
is
not
involved.
it's
--
other
constitutional
principles
are
involved.
and
that's
why
we
say
the
real
issue
here
is
due
process.
was
the
regulation
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
unreasonable?
what
was
the
legal
right
which
the
government
invaded?
was
it
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
the
business
of
mining
gold,
although
that
business
was
detrimental
to
the
nationwide
struggle
free
and
immune
from
the
sacrifices
of
war?
well
if
a
legal
right
was
invaded,
what
other
legal
right
could
it
be?
what
kind
of
an
enterprise
was
this?
for
two
decades
the
sole
market
for
gold
in
the
united
states
was
the
united
states
government
and
that's
the
market
today.
under
the
reserve
act
of
1934
the
acquisition
of
gold,
the
transportation
of
gold,
the
treatment
of
gold,
the
possession,
sale
import,
export
was
all
subject
to
regulation,
licensing
by
the
treasurer.
so
anyone
engaging
in
that
business
did
so
subject
to
its
peculiar
nature,
subject
to
the
fact
that
gold
was
affected
by
the
public
interest.
now
these
gold
mining
companies
had
invaded
the
federal
fields,
they
placed
a
drag,
a
drain
on
this
nation's
struggle
for
survival.
they
had
no
constitutional
right
to
operate
in
a
dream
world
of
their
own
immune
from
the
burden
and
sacrifice
of
that
struggle.
the
attorney
general
homer
cummings
said
in
a
gold
clause
cases
right
here,
these
claimants
were
upon
federal
territory,
they
were
squatters
in
the
public
domain.
i
say
he
had
not
constitutional
right
to
conduct
what
under
those
conditions
i
describe
temporarily
was
a
parasitic
industry.
we
didn't
have
--
the
nation
didn't
have
to
carry
that
burden
on
its
back
when
farmer
jones
couldn't
prevent
his
son
from
being
drafted
into
the
war.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
are
you
referring
to
the
special
reference
aact?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
are
you
referring
to
the
act,
are
you
referring
to
the
act
that
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
claims
to
hear
this
case?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
as
i
interpret
the
special
reference
act
i
don't
think
that
congress
attempted
to
define
the
approach
of
the
court
of
claims
or
to
limit
their
consideration
as
to
any
of
the
defenses
or
as
to
any
asserted
rights.
i
think
they
left
it
to
the
court
of
claims
to
determine
whether
these
people
after
eliminating
latches,
limitations,
perhaps
estoppable
could
make
out
a
case
for
compensation.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
compensation
for
we
interpret
to
mean
a
taking
a
private
property
for
public
use,
because
that
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
i
am
not
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
i
have
not
made
that
analysis
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
might
say
that
not
a
single
member
of
the
court
of
claims,
who
are
all
accustomed
and
experienced
in
dealing
with
these
special
reference
acts,
accepted
the
contention
of
the
respondents
that
this
act
created
a
liability
per
se.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
by
the
united
states
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
it
was
certainly
handled
on
the
floor
of
the
house
in
the
senate
as
though
it
were
a
perfunctory
judicial
reference
to
have
the
court
determine
whether
they
had
a
legal
claim
because
there
was
no
discussion
of
it
on
the
house
of
the
floor.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes
there
was
a
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
the
report
uses
language
that
in
some
respects
gives
some
comfort
to
the
respondents
and
it
also
gives
some
comfort
to
us.
at
the
last
part,
beginning
on
page
five
of
our
reply
brief,
we
discuss
this
point.
you'll
find
on
page
seven,
a
quotation
from
the
senate
and
house
reports.
it
says,
at
the
present
time
many
other
claimants,
this
is
after
referring
to
this
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
in
idaho0maryland,
that
on
the
pleadings
the
complainants
there,
had
stated
a
case
for
just
compensation.
they
say
at
the
present
time
many
other
claimants
who
have
a
better
right
for
an
adjudication
of
their
claims,
as
does
the
idaho
maryland
mines
corporation,
may
not
prosecute
such
claims
due
to
the
running
of
the
statute.
many
other
claimants
after
the
ruling
in
orofino
undoubtedly
felt
that
the
file
in
the
court
of
claims
would
be
useless,
and
therefore
allowed
this
statute
to
run
against
them.
so
you
see
this
bill,
which
passed
was
introduced
after
the
court
of
claims
had
decided
that
on
the
pleadings
there
was
a
taking
and
titling
the
claimants
to
just
compensation.
so
it
wasn't
necessary
for
--
so
we
say
that
congress
made
it
clear,
it
tried
to
open
up
this
thing
to
everybody
else,
similarly
affected.
i
would
like
to
save
ten
minutes.
i
just
like
to
say
this
in
conclusion
here,
if
the
--
this
order
had
an
impact
that
went
far
beyond
the
gold
companies
involved,
it
put
communities
out
of
business,
property
values
in
localities
near
the
mines
were
destroyed,
rental
values
were
destroyed,
shop
keepers
lost
customers,
business
if
not
property
and
none
of
those
people,
none
of
those
communities
can
recover
for
the
consequential
indirect
damage
which
they
sustained,
and
yet
the
respondents,
the
gold
companies
who
were
operating
a
business
affected
by
the
public
interest
claim
they
are
entitled
to
compensation.
so
we're
singling
out
this
industry,
operating
a
noxious
business,
now
gold
isn't
noxious
of
course,
but
i
say
the
production
of
gold
or
any
other
unnecessary
immaterial
commodity
in
war
time
when
our
national
safety
is
involved,
when
it's
consuming
critical
manpower
and
materials
which
we
must
have
elsewhere,
i
say
that,
that
definitely
is
noxious.
it
was
detrimental
to
the
public
welfare.
it
was
a
reasonable
exercise
of
national
power
in
the
national
interest
and
this
industry
affected
by
the
public
interest,
should
not
be
singled
out
for
special
consideration.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
senator
mccarran
introduced
two
bills
prior
to
this
special
jurisdictional
act,
to
provide
explicitly
for
compensation
for
these
gold
mine
companies
and
to
provide
for
an
administrative
recognition
of
the
clients
and
both
bills
failed
in
the
congress.

we

in
some
astronomically
amount
we
just
can't

correct

mr.

i
would
like
to
read
to
you
what
the
war
production
board
said
in
the
preamble
that's
been
attacked
here
with
respect
to
its
order.
it's
been
referred
to
as
camouflage.
it's
been
referred
to
as
untrue,
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
words
used
and
this
is
what
the
war
production
board
said
and
this
all
that
it
said.
the
fulfillment
of
requirements
for
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
am
reading
from
page
111
of
our
brief.
the
fulfillment
of
requirements
for
the
defense
of
the
united
states
has
created
a
shortage
in
the
supply
of
critical
materials
for
defense
for
private
accounts
and
for
export,
which
are
used
in
the
maintenance
and
operation
of
gold
mines
and
the
following
order
is
deemed
necessary
and
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
and
to
promote
the
national
defense.
that
was
a
solemn
declaration
of
the
executive.
the
war
production
board
was
acting
for
president
roosevelt.
it
was
his
act
just
as
it
was
their
act.
and
i
say
that
the
attack
made
16
years
later
upon
that
preamble
is
unjustifiable
and
unnecessary
and
it
doesn't
help
with
respondent's
case
because
at
page
99
of
their
brief
they
say
this,
“it
has
not
been
held
and
the
respondents
did
not
argue
that
the
order
was
unlawful.”
the
respondents
did
not
argue
that
the
order
was
unlawful
and
unlawful
means
invalid
and
valid
means
authorized
properly.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
believe
it
would
have
been
a
valid
order
then
but
i'd
like
to
say
this
and
i'll
have
to
qualify
my
statement
to
you
mr.
justice
harlan
that
is
an
expression
of
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
which
we
cannot
accept
and
if
you
will
just
read
one
report
in
the
record
as
to
a
study
made
of
the
consequences
of
this
order,
which
you'll
find
at
1223
showing
what
was
the
result
of
the
order,
what
were
its
consequences,
you
will
find
a
very
different
picture
from
that
found
by
the
court
of
claims.
you'll
find
that
they
discussed
substantial
increases
in
the
production
of
copper,
zinc
and
lead
$1.5
million
in
equipment
transferred
from
the
gold
mines
to
essential
non-ferrous
metal
mines,
$15
million
worth
of
strategic
material
was
released
from
the
gold
mines
that
were
closed.
the
order
resulted
in
the
transfer
of
approximately
2000
gold
miners
to
war
industries
and
at
least
1200
of
these
went
into
the
copper
mines
and
other
essential
non-ferrous
metal
mines.
well
the
other
side
dispute
this
report
and
they
have
some
figures
that
are
more
favorable
to
them.
but
it
emphasizes
that
it's
not
the
consequences
of
the
order
that
are
important
and
that
are
critical.
so
in
conclusion
i
would
merely
like
to
say
this,
there
were
good
reasons
for
the
high
policy
decision
that
gold
should
go
on
in
south
africa
and
canada
and
honduras
because
those
countries
were
absolutely
dependent
for
their
economy
on
it
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
contention
accepted
by
the
court
of
claims
is
a
very
reactionary
one
and
it
(inaudible)
private
property
far
beyond
anything
that's
been
held
in
any
decision
of
this
court.
