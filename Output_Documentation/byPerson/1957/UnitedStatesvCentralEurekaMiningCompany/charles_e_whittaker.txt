gold
mines
not
finding
what
conclusions
and
relevant
to
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
have
you
see
in
section
66,
statute
605,
any
congressional
codification
of
the
same
position
you
are
now
taking
namely
that
this
was
not
a
taking
of
the
property?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
dealing
especially
with
gold
mines.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
hear
this
or
any
other
case
respecting
gold
mines
alone,
contemplating
not
compensation
for
taking
but
damages
for
obstruction.
i
then
ask
you
if
you
see
in
that
statute
supports
for
your
position
a
--
congressional
complications
of
the
national
policy
that
would
be
l-208
was
not
a
taking
of
the
gold.
it
seems
if
i
may
suggest
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
codification
for
public
policy
by
congress,
but
it
does
then
go
on
and
say
that
the
court
of
claims
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
avoid
damages
not
from
a
taking
but
for
the
obstruction
to
the
gold
mine.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
call
it
a
special
jurisdictional
act,
is
it
your
concept
that
that's
all
this
statute
is,
is
a
jurisdiction
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
these
are
plain
and
simple
wordings
and
they
mean
what
they
say,
do
they
not,
and
if
they
create
a
cause
of
action
they
create
a
cause
of
action,
do
they
not?
