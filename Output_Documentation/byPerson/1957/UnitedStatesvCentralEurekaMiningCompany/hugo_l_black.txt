justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
report
in
full?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
meaning
if
i
understand
you
say
that
congress
by
the
passage
of
this
act
admitted
claim
against
the
government
for
whatever
damages
you
can
prove?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
suppose
the
court
insist
besides
what
you
say
(inaudible)
would
you
say
that
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
president?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
if
it
has
been
done
by
congress
directly
or
through
the
president
as
an
agent
(inaudible)
if
congress
has
directed
that
all
the
gold
mines
to
be
closed
and
(inaudible)
taking
of
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
wanted
to
get
at
was
that
if
you
get
the
full
force
of
your
argument
and
to
see
i
haven't
just
been
unable
to
see,
to
seek
relevance
in
the
so
called
(inaudible)
taking,
suppose
they
had
just
said
that
these
have
reached
a
conclusion
as
opposed
i
think
that's
detrimental
to
the
war
effort
to
produce
gold,
taking
away
manpower
and
so
forth
and
(inaudible)
no
gold
would
be
produced
thereafter
(inaudible)
would
you
say
that
was
a
taking
of
that
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
because
the
stated
ground
which
were
not
the
real
ground
and
that
is
a
question
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
amount
to
the
taking
to
the
rest,
there
is
no
production
to
be
had
at
any
particular,
in
a
particular
kind
of
industry
throughout
the
whole
nation,
is
that
a
taking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
say
that
the
order
affected
all
the
gold
producers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
have
found
that
was
not
the
purpose
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
ordinarily
true
that
the
purposes
of
the
administrative
agencies
in
issuing
order
while
they
are
given
broad
power
can
be
reviewed
by
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
we
call
it,
we
had
something
like
that
up
in
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
recall
just
exactly
whether
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
(inaudible)
was
the
bill
discussed
the
day
it
passed
the
senate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
bill
discussed
before
it
passed
the
senate,
the
bill
authorizing
this
suit,
was
there
any
discussion
of
it
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
consent
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
challenge
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
challenge
the
validity
of
the
order
the
board
issued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
accept
it
as
a
valid
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
i
don't
quite
understand
the
relevance
here
of
the
argument,
as
for
the
purpose
if
you
do
not
challenge
its
validity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
those
facts
would
have
been
material
to
determine
the
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
have
said
that
this
order
was
valid
does
that
depend
on
your
interpreting
it
as
a
taking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
order
was,
if
the
order
was
not
valid
of
course
i
assume
you
would
have
to
challenge
it
in
other
ways
rather
than
suit
for
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
what
i
want
to
find
out
if
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
much
of
what
you
just
said
has
been
attacking
the
purpose
for
which
the
order
was
issued.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
were
not
saying
that
the
order
was
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
he
put
in
those
bills?
i
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
with
reference
to
the
same
gold
mining
claims?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
later
did
he
have
this
bill
which
came
up
on
the
consent
calendar
without
discussing
â€“
five
minutes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
as
to
his
other
bills,
which
would
have
created
liability,
after
those
bills
failed
to
pass,
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
by
the
committee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
passed
on
the
consent
calendar.
i
just
read
the
reports,
is
there
anything
outside
the
report,
which
was
enough
to
tell
the
senators
to
come
that
there
was
being
a
liability
created
against
the
government,
an
absolute
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
over
there
and
i
found
it
interesting
[laughter].
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
assume
perhaps
that
either
the
senate
house
didn't
pass
them
or
the
committee
did
not
report
on
favor
and
after
that
happened,
he
offered
this
other
bill?
