justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
he
say
he
sold
it
to
him?
i've
just
read
here
that
(inaudible)
all
i've
seen
is
that,
and
maybe
that's
what
you
referred
to.
that
he
arranged,
he
talked
to
this
man
and
the
man
told
he
didn't
have
anybody.
that
he
was
going
to
get
some
for
himself
and
he
would
share
it
if
he
wanted
him
to.
and
you
said
that
the
man
went
and
got
it
from
somebody
else.
and
then
let
him
have
his
$15
--
that
he
had
$15
for
him.
but
why
do
you
say
he
sold
it
himself?
i
gather
that
i
--
i'm
not
talking,
playing
on
the
words,
but
i
gather
that
--
i
find
nothing
in
the
record
except
that
he
went
and
bought
it
from
someone
else,
not
that
he
was
selling
it.
that
he
would
then
bring
it
to
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes.
there's
no
doubt
about
delivery
but
he
explained
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
case.
but
as
i
read
it,
he
explained
that
the
man
never
did
claim
he
was
selling
it.
that
he
was
brought
some
himself
and
that
he
let
him
have
half
of
it
for
$15.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
did
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
shared
it
with
him
and
that
this
man
would
give
him
$15
before
he
went
to
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
he
said
the
officers
let
him
have
$15
before
he
went
to
get
it
in
some.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
your
record
shows
that
each
time
he
understood
that
man
would
go
get
it
and
bring
it
to
him
at
a
certain
place.
maybe
--
it
maybe
that's
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
he
had
nothing
to
do
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
could
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
get
it
going
in
and
through
other
sales,
didn't
he?
two
other
purchases,
turned
it
over
to
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
that
you've
seen
in
the
record?
i
haven't
read
it
all,
but
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
was
up
at
his
doctor's
office
for
any
purpose
except
to
get
him
to
the
transfer
and
decided
to
stop
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
in
the
record?
