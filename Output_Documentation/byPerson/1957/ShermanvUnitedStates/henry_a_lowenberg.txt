mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes,
sir,
if
your
honor
pleases,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
federal
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit.
there
had
been
two
trials
of
this
indictment.
first
trial
ended
in
a
judgment
of
conviction
which
was
unanimously
reversed
by
the
federal
court
of
appeals,
second
circuit.
then
there
had
been
a
retrial
of
the
case,
another
judgment
of
conviction
and
an
affirmance
by
the
federal
court
of
appeals.
i
might,
at
the
outset,
say
to
your
honors,
that
the
same
witnesses
testified
in
both
cases
with
the
following
exceptions.
that
the
government
produced
witnesses
to
testify
that
the
narcotics
in
this
case
had
been
disposed
of,
had
been
destroyed
and
therefore
could
not
be
produced
at
the
trial.
and
the
government
then
offered
a
new
evidence
as
a
part
of
the
government's
case,
the
defendant
having
rested
at
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case
at
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial.
the
previous
criminal
record
of
the
petitioner
would
show
that
in
1942
and
this
was
an
indictment
charging
alleged
sales
of
narcotics
in
1951.
that
1952,
the
petitioner
had
been
convicted
of
the
sale
of
narcotics
and
at
1946,
he
had
been
convicted
of
the
unlawful
purchase
of
narcotics
in
violation
of
section
2553,
not
sections
173,
174.
the
introduction
of
those
that
record
was
strenuously
objected
to,
was
overruled.
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
denied
in
other
conviction
and
then
the
federal
court
of
appeals
second
circuit
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction.
now,
the
witnesses
as
i
stated
to
this
court,
who
testified
in
the
second
trial,
were
the
same
witnesses
who
testified
in
the
first
trial.
it's
our
contention
one,
that
the
court
erred
in
not
directing
a
verdict
of
acquittal
on
the
ground
there
was
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
two,
the
admissibility
of
this
record
into
evidence.
thirdly,
that
if
it
were
admissible
it
was
so
remote
in
time,
as
to
make
it
absolutely
prejudicial
and
biased
to
the
accused
it's
offering
it
into
evidence.
three
agents
testified
for
the
government
and
an
informer,
a
man
working
with
an
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics.
and
i
dare
say
the
government
cannot
dispute
that
this
charles
kalchinian
was
an
informer
attached
to
an
agent.
this
kalchinian
had
been
arrested
and
convicted
of
two
sales
of
narcotics
in
june,
1951
and
upon
his
conviction,
he
agreed
to
work
with
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics.
according
to
the
record
he
built
up
three
cases
for
the
government.
and
he
went
on
just
to
testify.
at
page
100,
on
cross
examination,
and
when
i
had
a
referral
back
to
the
question
asked
of
him
at
the
previous
trial,
and
it
was
your
job
while
working
with
these
agents
to
go
out
and
try
to
induce
a
person
to
sell
narcotics
to
you,
is
not
correct.
i
would
say
yes
to
that.
do
you
remember
that?
if
that's
what
i
said,
let
us
stand
that
way.
because
he
had
previously
said
that
he
didn't
recall
that
kind
of
testimony.
now,
the
facts
were
generally
these.
this
petitioner
was
seated
in
a
doctor's
office.
he
was
an
addict,
being
treated
by
this
physician
for
withdrawal
treatment
for
a
cure
of
narcotic
addiction
by
dr.grossman
who
has
a
speciality
in
treating
narcotic
addicts.
there
he
saw
seated
on
another
chair
this
government
informer.
they
saw
each
other
in
a
doctor's
office
a
half
dozen
times,
not
by
their
own
appointments
but
because
the
doctor
had
asked
him
to
come
back
at
this
time.
after
a
half
a
dozen
times,
the
government
informer
said
hello
to
this
petitioner.
they
had
gone
to
the
same
pharmacy
to
have
their
prescriptions
filled.
this
alleged
informer
or
this
informer,
i
should
say,
then
asked
the
petitioner
about
his
experiences
in
using
narcotics.
he
broached
the
subject
to
this
addict.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
doctor's
office.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
as
a
patient,
too,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
no,
no,
judge.
he
was
patient,
too,
according
to
the
testimony.
he
asked
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
about
his
experiences
in
dealing
in
narcotics
and
using
it,
how
he
was
responding
to
his
treatment.
and
finally
after
seeing
the
defendant
several
times,
he
said
to
the
defendant,
maybe
you
can
get
some
stuff.
we'll
share
it
between
us.
first
time
that
the
defendant
didn't
answer.
second
time
they
met
at
the
pharmacy
the
--
kalchinian
said
to
this
defendant,
“maybe
i
can
meet
with
your
man.”
defendant
said,
"i
know
men
in
the
narcotic
business
but
my
man
has
gone
out
of
business.”
third
time,
he
said
to
him,
he
uses
exact
language.
he
said
to
this
petitioner
kalchinian,
“i'm
not
responding
to
treatment.
i
need
something
to
sustain
myself.”
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
kalchinian
the
government
informer
to
this
poor
addict,
the
petitioner
who
had
--
had
been
at
that
doctor's
office
for
treatment.
kalchinian
said
to
him,
"i'm
not
responding
to
treatment.
i
need
something
to
sustain
myself."
thereupon,
after
all
his
employs,
this
petitioner
weakened
and
said
to
him,
“well,
i
can
introduce
you
but
maybe
i
can
get
some
stuff.
let
me
have
your
telephone
number.”
he
gave
it.
the
stuff
that
he
got
amounted
to
$25.
the
kalchinian
share
was
$15.
he
said
to
him,
“i
had
to
use
some
taxi
money,
some
expense.
so,
it
will
cost
you
15,”
and
the
defendant
retained
the
other
portion
of
the
narcotics.
this
had
been
going
for
a
little
while
until
finally
kalchinian
decided
to
report
it
to
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics.
and
he
did.
and
kalchinian
testified
at
the
trial,
on
cross-examination.
and
i'd
like
to
read
that
portion
of
it
because
i
consider
it
very
important.
that
on
page
115
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
that,
"and
you
took
suggestions
from
them,”
meaning
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics,
“as
to
how
to
approach
this
defendant,
did
you
not?”
“they
made
suggestions,
yes."
"they
made
suggestions
to
you?”
“yes.”
“and
that
was
all
done
to
cause
the
arrest
this
defendant
was
it
not?”
“i
can't
say.”
“you
know
that
to
be
so,
don't
you,
if
that
happened.
well
you
know
what
happened,
don't
you?”
“yes
i
do
know
what
happened,
yes.”
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
on
his
own,
then.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
on
his
own,
then.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
kalchinian
claims
there
had
been
a
sharing
of
narcotics
between
them
as
two
addicts.
in
other
words
he
had
induced
this
petitioner
to
obtain
narcotics
for
him
because
he
said,
he
wasn't
responding
to
treatment
and
they
shared
between
them
$25
worth
of
narcotics
on
a
number
of
occasions.
and
then
subsequently
he
went
down
to
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
the
conviction
is
for
the
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes,
yes,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
now,
the
conviction
is
--
was
that
after
he
reported
it
to
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics,
after
kalchinian
had
told
them
what
had
been
going
on,
then
the
government
agents
directed
him
how
to
act.
they
told
they
gave
him
the
money,
for
example.
they
--
they
searched
him,
drove
him
up
to
the
meeting
spot
where
he
met
the
petitioner,
searched
him
to
see
that
he
had
no
narcotics
on
him,
gave
him
$15
which
was
his
share
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
subsequent,
subsequent
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
on
his
own.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that
they
had
already
prepared
him.
they
had
already
prepared
up
before
this
--
before
this
informer
went
down
to
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics.
in
other
words,
they
had
already
been
dividing
between
them
the
narcotics
as
fellow
addicts.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
well,
my
--
my
point
is
this
though.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
the
position
of
the
government.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
assume
that's
their
position.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
now
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
they
had
met
in
the
doctor's
office.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
this
is
the
fourth
case.
yes,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
$25
transaction.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
will
--
i
will
so
refer
to
it.
i
will
read
the
testimony
right
from
the
--
from
the
record.
kalchinian
called
as
a
witness
by
the
government,
“mr.
kalchinian,
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
crime?”
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
“yes
sir
i
have.”
“what
made
you.”
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
pages
66,
67.
“when
were
you
so
convicted
and
what
was
the
crime?”
“i
was
charged
and
convicted
with,
i
was
charged
and
convicted
for
a
sale
of
a
package
of
narcotics
twice
to
a
man
in
1952.
it
occurred
in
1951,
but
i
(inaudible)
"when
were
you
arrested
for
that
crime?"
“in
1951,
sir.”
“do
you
recall
the
month?”
“i
believe
about
the
early
part
of
may
or
june.
i
forget
quite
which,
about
june
i
believe
1951.”
“by
whom
were
you
arrested?”
“by
one
agency,
one
agent's
name
i
recall,
agent
stephen.”
“was
that
an
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics.”
“yes,
sir.”
“following
your
arrest
did
you
perform
services
for
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics?”
this
on
direct
examination,
“yes,
i
did.”
“at
the
time
of
your
arrest
were
you
addicted
to
the
use
of
narcotics?”
“yes,
i
was.”
“for
how
long,
thereafter,
were
you
addicted,
thereafter?”
“off
and
on
few
months."
"do
you
know
the
defendant
and
sherman?”
now
further,
on
page
100,
on
cross
examination,
as
i
have
pointed
out
to
this
court
he
admitted
that
it
was
his
job,
while
working
with
these
agents,
to
go
out
and
try
to
induce
a
person
to
sell
to
him
narcotics.
that
was
his
job.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
at
the
time
he
first
met
sherman.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
because
he
had
already
pleaded
guilty
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
and
had
agreed
to
work
with
the
government
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
will
disclose
that
the
united
states
attorney
asked
the
court
for
a
suspended
sentence
on
behalf
of
kalchinian
because
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
meant
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
meant
this,
judge.
that
he
may
have
been
prompted
by
his
own
needs
that
he
needed.
but
he
still
was
cooperating
with
the
federal
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
bureau
of
narcotics
and
whether
there
was
a
lapse
of
a
month
or
six
months
until
he
reported
these
transactions,
he
was
still
an
informer.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
and
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
no
remuneration
except
that
he
was
saved
from
a
jailed
sentence
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
and
he
said,
“i
do
not
want
to
go
to
jail."
that
was
his
answer
to
the
question,
i
did
not
want
to
go
to
jail.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
i
asked
him
whether
he
would,
whether
he
would
induce
an
innocent
man
to
buy
narcotics,
whether
he'd
frame
an
innocent
man,
he
had
hesitated
and
he
said,
“i
wouldn't
know.”
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
wouldn't
know.
he
couldn't
answer
the
question
until
the
government,
after
i
got
through
with
a
lengthy
cross
examination,
on
rebuttal,
asked
him
the
direct
again
and
he
said,
no
i
wouldn't
do
it.
but
in
response
to
my
course
he
said,
“i
wouldn't
know.”
he
couldn't
answer
the
question.
so
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes?
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
well,
this
is
what
happened.
sherman
came
up
with
the
$25
in
narcotics.
they
had
arranged
to
meet
at
a
certain
corner,
sherman
and
kalchinian.
and
sherman
would
pass
half
of
the
narcotics
to
him
and
say
you
owe
me
$15,
a
part
of
it
for
taxi
expenses.
the
other
half
sherman
would
keep
see?
and
that
he
would
keep
for
himself,
for
his
own
use.
in
other
words,
here
while
he
was
at
a
doctor's
office
for
a
cure
for
narcotic
addiction,
here
was
this
informer
of
the
government
enticing
him
back
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
into
narcotic
addiction.
it
was
a
question
of
addicts
sharing
between
themselves
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
the
--
the
narcotics
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
and
not
selling
it
for
a
profit.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
no,
no,
judge.
he
was
not,
no.
not
until,
not
until
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
he
reported
it
a
month
later
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
decided
he'd
get
down
and
continue,
you
see?
this
course
of
operation
was
started
june,
1951.
these
alleged
sales
took
place
november,
1951,
see?.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
november
1st,
november
7th,
november
16th
and
he
started
to
work
for
the
government
in
june,
1951.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
he
was
prosecuted
for
the
sharing
transaction.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
he
was,
for
the
$25
transaction.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
all
that
was
involved
in
those
three
sales
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
were
the
$25
transactions,
nothing
else.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
successive
$25
--
$25
transactions
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
on
november
1,
november
7th,
november
16th.
it
was
just
a
sharing
between
them.
the
agent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
in
october.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
he
was
told,
that
he
said
according
to
his
testimony
and
that's
the
best
i
can
offer,
was
that
they
made
suggestions
to
him,
as
to
how
to
approach
this
petitioner
to
my
own
way
of
thinking.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
how
to
deal
with
it,
to
my
own
way
of
thinking.
although,
i
did
develop
it,
to
my
own
way
of
thinking.
i
think
what
the
government
had
in
mind
was
whether
sherman
would
come
up
with
some
narcotics
of
a
more
substantial
value
than
$25,
and
sell
it
to
this
informant.
but
all
that
he
received
and
all
that
was
divided
between
them,
was
$25
in
narcotics
on
these
three
occasions.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
nothing
else.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
there
were
three
sets.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
all
$25
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
all
of
them
shared.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
read
the
opinion
of
the
federal
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
prior
convictions,
prior
conviction
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
treating
of
entrapment.
and
i
refer
to
page
16
of
my
brief.
at
--
quote
at
pages
882
and
883
of
this
case
said,
"therefore,
in
such
cases,
two
questions
of
fact
arise.
one,
that
the
agent
induced
the
accused
to
commit
the
offense
charged
in
the
indictment.
two,
if
so,
was
the
accused
ready
and
willing
without
persuasion?
and
was
he
awaiting
any
propitious
opportunity
to
commit
the
offense?
on
the
first
question,
the
accused
has
the
burden,
on
the
second
the
prosecution
has
it.
in
the
case
at
bar,
plainly,
kalchinian
did
induce
the
first
sale.
but
that
was
irrelevant
unless
at
that
time
the
two
had
made
the
agreement
described
above.
if
they
did
it
would
be
true
that
the
later
sales
resulted
from
kalchinian's
original
inducement
for
it
meant
that
he
was
in
a
market,
so
to
say,
and
might
buy
whenever
sherman
had
any
heroin
to
offer.
although,
as
we
have
said
on
that
issue,
sherman
had
the
affirmative,
the
evidence
to
support
the
defense
was
ample
if
indeed
not
conclusive.
on
the
other
hand,
since
the
prosecution
had
the
burden
upon
the
issue
of
the
excuse
for
inducement,
it
had
to
satisfy
the
jury
that
sherman
did
not
need
any
persuasion.
but
that
he
stood
ready
to
procure
heroin
for
anyone
who
asked
for
it.
and
the
evidence
scarcely
supported
such
a
finding.
so
far
as
appeared,
sherman
shared
his
heroin
with
kalchinian
as
a
fellow
addict
and
without
profit.
now,
at
the
second
try,
the
tried
to
overcome
that.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
except
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
except
judge,
on
cross
examination.
he
testified
that
he
had
built
up
three
other
cases
for
the
government.
this
was
the
fourth
case.
he
had
built
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
he
didn't
whether
they
were
addicts,
but
he
said
he
had
built
three
cases
for
the
government.
now,
on
the
second
trial,
he
tried
to
overcome
that.
the
government
asked
him
whether
he
had
bought
narcotics
at
a
cheaper
rate
before,
and
he
said,
yes.
now,
i
say
to
your
honors,
what
of
consequence,
would
that
be?
here,
there
was
definitely
an
arrangement
between
kalchinian
and
this
petitioner
to
share
narcotics.
if
this
petitioner
had
to
pay
a
little
more
to
an
individual
to
get
it,
to
share
it
with
this
kalchinian,
then
i
say
it
would
make
no
difference.
it
doesn't
make
a
seller
out
of
--
out
of
sherman.
the
fact
remains
is
that
kalchinian
induced
sherman
against
this
will,
when
he
was
in
a
doctor's
office
seeking
a
cure,
getting
a
withdrawal
treatment
to
lift
him
out
of
the
realm
of
being
an
addict,
that
this
contemptible
creature
kalchinian
working
with
the
government,
going
there
for
a
treatment
and
(inaudible)
saying
to
sherman
finally
after
speaking
to
him
several
times,
i'm
not
responding
to
treatment.
i
need
--
i
need
something,
get
it
for
me.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
let
me
ask
you
this
--
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
say
no,
judge,
i
say
it
would
not
be
a
sale.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
not
a
sale,
no.
if
the
government
could
apprehend
him
in
possession
of
narcotics,
they
charge
him
with
possession.
but
they
could
not
treat
it
as
a
sale,
because
--
pardon
me
judge?
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
say
it
for
this
reason.
that
a
sale
anticipates
a
profit.
suppose
i
were
an
addict.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
--
i
would
say
it
would
be
a
transfer
without
a
sale.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
it
would
be
a
division
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
it
would
be
a
division
between
them
and
nothing
more,
nothing
more.
it
wouldn't
show
that
he's
seller
in
the
sense
of
the
word,
that
the
law
condemns
that
the
man
who
has
--
has
narcotics
at
his
disposal,
goes
out
and
sells
it
to
one
person,
second
person,
third
person.
he
is
in
the
business
of
dealing
in
narcotics.
it
would
merely
show
a
division
between
two
addicts,
and
nothing
else
for
their
own
use.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
well,
except
this
judge.
that
apparently
from
the
trial
of
these
narcotic
cases,
where
an
agent
is
not
an
addict
and
he
is
on
the
--
he's
on
the
market
to
buy,
and
the
defendant
would
show
a
willingness
to
sell
and
there's
no
entrapment,
then
the
courts
treat
it
as
a
--
as
a
sale
--
as
a
sale,
unless
the
individual
was
entrapped
into
--
into
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
you
might
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
oh
well
if
he
represents
himself
to
be
an
addict,
that's
something
else.
but
i'm
assuming
a
government
agent
who
comes
along
and
says
to
a
man,
there's
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
sale
of
narcotics
and
i
have
means
of
disposing
of
narcotics.
that's
what
i
have
in
mind
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
and
see
whether
if
he
gets,
say,
some
narcotics
and
we'll
--
we'll
sell
it.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
true
that
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
didn't
say
that
was
a
sale
in
the
sense
that's
in
the
sherman
case.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
he
was
convicted
for
that.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
he
is
convicted
for
that.
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
that
it
was
a
division
between
them,
the
narcotics
without
profit.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
sherman.
and
then
he
got
$15
back
from
kalchinian.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
pardon?
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
for
taxi
fare.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
taxi
fare,
and
nothing
more.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
$12.50
was
for
his
share
of
the
heroin,
they
divided
it.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
say
it
was
not
a
sale.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
all
of
the
same
nature.
all
transactions
were
--
were
conducted
the
same
way.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
i
urged
that
below
and
the
court
held
there,
in
affirming
this
conviction.
said
that
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
profit
involved
or
not
it's
a
sale.
and
it
constitutes
a
sale
in
judge
medina's
opinion.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
not
a
sale,
no.
no.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
same
kind
of
a
thing,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
sherman
--
sherman
just
laid
it
out
and
he
reimbursed
him.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
said
it's
a
sale.
the
lower
court
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
not
before
us,
no.
now,
the
--
so
here
we
have
a
situation
as
i
pointed
out
to
your
honors
where
the
--
this
kalchinian
developed
this
case
for
the
government.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
second
sherman
case.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
no,
no.
i
didn't
raise
it
in
the
first
case.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
all.
i
just
let
it
to
go
by
and
just
raised
the
question
at
the
trial.
now,
the
--
all
the
agents
testified
to
was
a
fact
that
after
kalchinian
came
down
to
the
agent
(inaudible)
to
whom
he
was
assigned
at
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics
that
they
drove
him
uptown,
they
searched
him
to
find
out
whether
he
--
to
see
whether
he
had
any
narcotics
on
him,
gave
him
the
$15,
saw
something
pass
between
sherman
and
kalchinian.
kalchinian
would
come
back
to
car.
they'd
searched
him
and
find
narcotics.
they'd
put
it
in
a
glassine
envelope
and
that
initially.
but
they
also
testified
that
sherman
was
a
handyman.
that
sherman
earned
his
living
as
a
handyman
and
as
a
collector
of
rents
in
a
house
on
west
17th
street.
they
knew
that
to
be
his
income.
that
he
was
not
getting
his
income
from
the
sale
of
narcotics.
that
here
he
was
legitimately,
legally
employed.
and
on
the
--
the
last
occasion
on
november
16th,
when
they
drove
kalchinian
uptown
to
meet
sherman,
they
gave
to
kalchinian
listed
american
currency,
took
the
numbers
off
the
bills
and
when
they
saw
it
pass
to
sherman,
they
trailed
sherman
to
his
home
in
west
17th
street
to
his
apartment
building,
to
his
rooming
house,
worked
in
on
him
and
said,
“you're
under
arrest”
“what
for?”
“narcotics.”
he
denied
knowing
anything
about
narcotics.
they
said
take
your
money
out
of
your
pocket
and
then
among
the
bills
they
found
this
amount
of
money.
they
searched
him.
they
found
no
narcotics.
they
searched
his
apartment,
they
found
no
narcotics.
they
found
no
evidence
to
the
fact
that
sherman
does
not
or
did
not
earn
his
living
as
a
handyman
and
as
a
collector
of
rents
and
taking
care
of
these
premises
on
west
17th
street.
now,
that
in
substance,
is
the
testimony
of
the
agents.
and
--
and
according
to
their
own
admissions
they
weren't
concerned.
they
weren't
concerned
at
all
as
to
how
that
kalchinian
got
sherman
to
sell
or
to
give
him
narcotics
to
put
it
that
way.
they
weren't
concerned
at
all
about
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
(inaudible)
the
agent
to
whom
kalchinian
was
assigned,
on
cross
examination,
at
page
29,
from
28
to
29
said
he
wasn't
present
at
any
conversation
between
kalchinian
and
the
--
the
petitioner.
and
he
does
not
know
if
kalchinian
would
induce
anyone
to
sell
him
narcotics.
he
wasn't
concerned
with
him,
neither
were
the
other
agents
as
to
how
these
alleged
transfers
took
place.
all
they
were
interested
in
was
the
evidence
there,
nothing
else
or
what
comes
down
to,
this
meeting
of
kalchinian
with
sherman
in
a
doctor's
office.
now,
i
dare
say
that
if
an
addict
who
goes
to
a
doctor's
office
has
to
be
fearful
of
the
fact
that
he
may
meet
the
agent
of
the
government
or
an
informer
of
the
government
in
that
office,
why,
he'd
be
fearful
to
go
there.
and
yet
our
policy
is
try
to
readjust
and
rehabilitate
these
medically
unfortunate,
these
medically
sick
people
and
yet
the
government
used
this
man
in
a
doctor's
office
to
entice,
to
induce
sherman
to
give
him
narcotics,
at
least.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
yes.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
--
that's
the
case.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
he
said
he
was.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
want
--
just
want
to
point
this
out.
on
the
first
trial,
if
the
court
pleases,
well
i
might
find
it
because
it
was
very
interesting
here.
on
the
previous
trial,
--
let
me
just
find
it;
it
will
just
take
me
if
your
honors
will
just
bear
with
me.
on
the
previous
trial,
he
went
out
for
lunch
with
one
of
the
agents.
and
the
agent
asked
him,
“how
do
you
think
we
are
getting
on?”
and
kalchinian
says,
“i
think
we
are
doing
all
right.
i
think
we
are
doing
all
right.”
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
a
second
trial
i
had
to
repeat
the
questions
and
answers
to
him
given
by
him
on
the
first
trial,
which
clearly
establishes
beyond
any
question
of
doubt
that
besides
the
fact
that
he
built
three
cases
for
the
government
and
was
working
for
the
government
that
here
he
was
particularly
interested
in
the
outcome
of
the
case
because
when
he
went
out
with
the
government
agent
for
lunch,
the
government
agent
asked
him,
“how
do
you
think
we're
getting
on?”
and
he
says,
“i
think
we're
are
getting
on
all
right.”
he
said,
“i
think
we're
getting
on
all
right.”
now,
i
say
to
your
honors
could
there
possibly
be
a
stronger
case
of
entrapment?
now,
when
we
come
down
to
these
convictions
42
and
46,
the
first
conviction
in
42
as
i
say
to
your
honors
was
for
the
unlawful
sale
of
smoking
opium.
in
46,
it
was
for
the
unlawful
purchase
of
heroin,
of
narcotics,
unlawful
purchase
--
purchase
not
sale
under
2553.
i'm
trying
an
indictment
in
51.
how
could
that
be
possible,
a
lapse
of
nine
years
in
the
first
indictment
in
1942,
which
constituted
a
sale
of
smoking
opium
to
1951,
to
show
a
predisposition,
a
criminal
intent
on
the
file.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
no
evidence
at
all
except
the
government
as
i
started
to
remark
relied
upon
the
convictions
of
this
--
prior
convictions
of
this
petitioner.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
for
the
dates
that
i
have
just
given
and
also
kalchinian
testifying
i
obtained
narcotics
at
a
cheaper
rate
from
some
other
person
before
i
divided
it
with
sherman.
that's
all
nothing
else.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
there
was
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
correct,
judge.
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
here
they
meet
in
the
same
doctor's
office
who
would
be
just
like
two
manufacturers
of
a
process
who
might
meet
on
the
outside
and
discuss
their
business.
so,
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
when
you
have
two
addicts
in
a
doctor's
office
and
he
sends
him
to
a
pharmacy
or
they
meet
at
a
pharmacy
to
have
their
prescriptions
filled,
that
one
will
say
to
the
other,
how
are
you
responding
to
this
treatment
or
what
kind
of
stuff
have
you
been
using
or
how
much
have
you
been
paying
for
it,
and
so
on.
so,
he
asked
him
once
when
he
saw
him.
he
asked
him
the
second
time
when
he
saw
him.
and
then
finally,
finally,
finally,
he
said
to
him
i
am
not
responding,
i
need
something.
and
it
was
then
that
sherman
said,
let
me
have
your
telephone
number.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
and
divided
between
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
divided
between.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
this
occasion.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
no
question
about
that.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
that's
no
–
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
the
only
thing
the
government
argues
in
its
brief
which
i
feel
is
absolutely
fantastic
is
that
maybe
sherman
wasn't
there
for
a
cure.
maybe
he
was
there
to
look
for
potential
customers.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
well
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
none
at
all.
and
i
might
say
further
to
your
honor
that
if
you
or
i
--
if
i
were
a
physician
and
if
your
honor
was
a
physician,
saw
a
man
around
your
office
day
after
day
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
there
and
if
you've
permitted
him
just
to
remain
to
try
or
get
potential
customers
to
sell
narcotics
to,
at
least
he'd
be
guilty
of
a
conspiracy.
so
that
argument
on
the
part
of
the
government
is,
absolutely,
i
say
a
desperate
argument
to
try
to
sustain
this
conviction.
he
was
there
for
a
--
for
treatment.
kalchinian
testified
that
they
even
discussed
the
treatment
that
they
were
getting
and
that
was
the
government's
witness,
kalchinian.
and
it
was
in
a
bonafide
doctor's
office.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
now,
i'd
just
like
to
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
--
about
two
or
three
minutes.
if
the
court
pleases,
the
direct
transcript
will
show
on
page
67
that
this
kalchinian
was
convicted
in
1952.
on
page
99,
it'll
show
that
he
had
promised
to
cooperate
with
the
government
in
1951.
and
that
was
before
his
sentence.
so
that
he
was
cooperating
with
the
government
up
to
the
time
that
he
got
a
suspended
sentence
in
1952,
which
was
past
the
dates
of
this
alleged
division
of
narcotics
between
kalchinian
and
sherman.
now
he
--
as
on
the
question
as
to
whether
he
was
a
hired
man
or
not,
all
i
will
say
to
this
court
is
this.
that
kalchinian
(inaudible)
admitted
on
a
witness
stand.
he
says,
"i
didn't
want
to
go
to
jail,
that
was
all
there
was
to
it.
i
was
ready
to
do
anything,
cooperate
with
the
government.
that
was
my
purpose
to
save
myself
from
going
to
jail."
well,
that's
payment
sufficient
for
anybody.
mr.
henry
a.
lowenberg
pardon
me?

henry
a.
lowenberg
