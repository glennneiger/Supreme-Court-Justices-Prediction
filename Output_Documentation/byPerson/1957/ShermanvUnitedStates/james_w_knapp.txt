mr.
james
w.
knapp
(inaudible)
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
we
come
again
to
the
question
of
whether
the
entrapment
issue
was
one
for
the
jury.
and
we
contend
that
the
facts
did
not
show
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
secondly,
that
the
rebuttal
evidence
is
properly
admitted,
intended
to
show
that
the
petitioner
was
not
an
innocent
person
at
the
time
again
when
this
transaction
took
place.
now,
kalchinian
was
a
government
informant.
he
was
an
addict
who
had
been
arrested
for
a
narcotic
violation
in
june
of
1951
and
who
had
turned
informant
in
the
hope
of
helping
himself.
he
was
an
addict
and
the
record
shows
that
he
had
built
up
two
other
cases
sometime
prior
to
the
time
that
he
engaged
in
this
transaction
with
sherman.
now,
the
record
as
i
read
it,
record
100
and
--
and
at
page
27,
indicates
the
defendant
rather
the
--
kalchinian
has
said
that
it
was
not
his
job
to
induce
someone
to
sell
narcotics.
that
question
was
asked
him.
top
of
page
100
of
the
record,
“and
it
was
your
job,
was
it
not,
while
you
were
working
with
these
agents
to
go
out
and
try
to
induce
somebody
to
sell
you
narcotics,
isn't
that
true?”
answer,
“no,
it
wasn't
my
job
at
all
to
do
anything
of
that
kind.”
and
when
you
get
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
page,
he
says,
“so,
when
you
testify
now
that
it
was
not
your
job
you're
not
telling
the
truth?
he's
cross-examined
in
the
meantime
on
his
prior
testimony.
the
answer
is
“i
mean
by
job
that
nobody
hired
me
for
that.
that
is
what
i
inferred,
otherwise,
i
meant
the
same
thing
in
my
answer
to
your
question.”
then
he
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
where
he
did
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
so
that
--
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
yes,
he
had
previously
testified
to
that
on
the
prior
trial.,
there's
two
trials
here.
this
is
the
second
trial
and
what
if
--
what
mr.
lowenberg
is
doing
is
cross-examining
him
on
his
testimony
at
the
prior
trial.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
so,
now,
we
have
--
we
have
him
saying
now,
he
didn't
--
that
it
wasn't
his
job
to
induce
him.
and
he
said
on
the
prior
trial
that
it
was
and
he
is
cross-examining
him
on.
so,
we
have
two
statements
now.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
he
says,
“i
mean
by
job
that
nobody
hired
me.”
he,
i
guess
--
he's
trying
to
explain
himself.
but
he
had
built
up
to
other
cases.
now,
the
agents
testified
on
record
28.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
oh,
i'm
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
he
say
at
the
--
at
the
start,
it
wasn't
his
job
to
do
anything
of
the
kind.
then
he
cross-examined
him
on
the
prior
testimony
in
which
he
did
say
yes
that
it
was
his
job
to
go
out
and
try
to
induce
a
person.
and
then
he
--
he
says,
well,
yes,
that's
what
i
testified
to.
and
he
says
he
believed
he
testified
to
it
and
it
was
the
truth.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
then
he
says
by
--
“so
when
you
testify
now
it
was
not
your
job
you're
not
telling
the
truth?
he
says,
"i
answer,
i
mean
by
job
that
nobody
hired
it
--
that
hired
me
for
that.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that
is
what
i
inferred.
otherwise,
it
left
the
same
thing
in
my
answer
to
your
question.”
so
he
is,
and
you're
right,
your
honor.
he
is
in
effect
saying
that.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
for
it.
but
there
was
other
testimony
by
the
agents
that
they
didn't
hire
him
to
do
that.
did
you
--
on
record
page
28
(inaudible)
said,
“did
you
give
him
any
instructions
as
pertaining
to
a
specific
case
that
we
were
working
on
with
sherman?”
“yes.”
but
before
that
he
said,
“did
you
–
did
he
receive
instructions
from
you
that
cooperating
with
the
bureau
meant
if
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
jail
to
go
out
and
try
to
buy
narcotics?”
“no,
sir.”
“you
gave
him
no
instructions
at
all?”
“not
along
those
lines,
sir.”
but
in
late
august
of
1951,
he
met
the
defendant
in
dr.grossman's
office,
and
grossman
had
a
practice
of
attempting
to
cure
addicts.
the
defendant
told
kalchinian
that
he
was
there
for
the
cure
and
the
meetings
were
not
arranged.
they
--
they
met
each
other.
they're
purely
fortuitous.
then
he
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
the
petitioner
by
routine
greetings.
and
i
--
and
i
think
in
one
place,
he
said
he
more
or
less
talked
to
him,
as
he
would
discuss
your
operation.
they
talked
about
their
experiences
and
what
they
had
been
going
through.
and
then
the
petitioner
--
or
the
informant
asked
the
petitioner
if
he'd
been
getting
drugs
and
what
quality.
the
record
at
page
68,
question
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“when
you
state
what
his
experiences
had
been,
can
you
state
more
in
detail
what
your
conversation
was?”
answer
“well,
we
spoke
to
each
other
such
as
many
people
who
go
through
operations.
they
ask
about
their
mutual
experiences
and
that
was
the
gist
of
the
conversation.
and
first,
i
asked
him
if
he
had
been
getting
drugs,
what
quality
and
so
on
and
the
conversation
went
along
those
lines
at
the
first.”
question
--
top
of
page
69,
--
“and
about
when
did
the
conversation
take
this
turn?”
answer
“i
would
say
about
the
end
of
august.”
“did
you
ever
speak
to
the
defendant
about
introducing
you
to
his
connections?”
and
it
was
--
the
objection
was
sustained.
“in
addition
--
in
the
--
in
the
course
of
your
discussion
with
the
defendant
about
your
addiction,
did
you
ever
ask
him
anything
further?”
“yes
i
did.
“after
a
while,
i
asked
him
if
there
was
a
reliable
man
i
could
met
sometime
that
i
needed
him
and
i
asked
him
along
those
lines.”
“and
what
did
he
say
to
you?”
“he
told
me
that
he
did
know
some
people.”
“and
what
did
you
say
to
him?”
“i
asked
him
if
it
were
possible
for
me
to
meet
some
of
these
people
or
one
perhaps.”
“and
what
did
he
say?
“he
didn't
say
anything
at
the
time.
but
i
spoke
to
him
again
on
that
subject."
and
he
said
no.
he
couldn't
see
how
i
could
meet
this
particular
person,
this
one
in
particular.
and
i
asked
him,
why
not?
and
he
explained
that
the
man
was
going
out
of
business
turning
it
over
to
someone
else.
and
in
this
change
and
so
on,
he
didn't
think
that
i
could
meet
him
at
all.”
“did
you
ever
tell
the
defendant
the
purpose
for
which
you
wanted
to
meet
this
man?”
answer
“yes,
i
told
him
i
was
not
responding
to
treatment
very
well
and
needed
something
for
myself
to
maintain
myself
to
a
level,
but
he
couldn't
see
how
he
could
introduce
me
to
him.”
so
that
it
appears
that
the
first
approach
by
kalchinian
to
the
petitioner
was
not
that
the
petitioner
sell
him
any
narcotics
or
as
mr.
lowenberg
suggests,
split
any
narcotics
with
me.
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
find
out
who
he
could
get
some
for,
for
his
own
needs.
and
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
the
thing
in
the
record
is
that
that
he
eventually,
not
eventually,
i
think
after
three
approaches.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
by
kalchinian.
and
incidentally,
there's
a
question
raised
there
as
to
whether
kalchinian
there
acting
as
a
government
agent.
it
was
raised
here
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
and
this
point
has
never
been
raised
by
anyone,
as
far
as
i
can
see
in
any
point
as
to
whether
the
informant
was
an
agent
at
the
time
he
first
made
these
purchases.
now,
he
made
these
purchases
from
sherman
beginning
the
first
part
of
september,
and
continuing
on
through
until
november.
and
as
he
testifies,
they
had
an
arrangement
whereby
when
sherman
had
drugs
to
sell
him,
he
would
call
him
at
his
office
or
his
place
of
employment
and
--
and
they
had
a
regular
system.
they
knew
where
they
were
going
to
meet,
the
place
had
been
set.
and
he
would
say,
tomorrow
or
do
you
want
some
tomorrow
at
2
o'clock?
and
they
would
meet
and
there'd
be
sales,
and
that
there
were
calls
three
to
four
times
a
week
from
sherman,
always
coming
from
sherman
to
him
saying
he
had
narcotics,
and
that
on
most
of
these
occasions,
he
went
to
meeting
him.
and,
thereby,
implying
that
be
bought
the
narcotics.
and
so
that
he
had
been
buying
narcotics
for
a
period
of
almost
two
months.
and
then
in
the
latter
part
of
october,
he
walked
in
to
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
said
i
can
make
a
case
for
you.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
just
about
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
my
--
my
understanding
from
it
is
taken
from
the
record.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir,
at
record
page
67.
that
he
was
arrested
in
may
or
june,
and
following
your
arrest
did
you
perform
services
for
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics?
yes,
i
did.
now,
that's
the
defendant
test
at
the
--
kalchinian's
testimony
on
that
and
(inaudible)
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes,
sir.
that
was
his
testimony.
i
--
i
have
a
record
reference
to
it
somewhere
here,
if
i
can
find
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
yes
--
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
would
assume
that.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
exact
method
by
which
special
employees
and
informants
are
used.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
following
his
--
following
his
arrest,
sir,
this
--
this
case,
this
is
by
--
arose
before
he
--
he
was
finally
sentenced.
but
on
record
page
26
(inaudible)
and
the
government
agent
said
he
had
known
kalchinian
since,
oh,
i
would
say
sometime
in
1951.
and
he
said,
“let
--
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
these
events
took
place
in
november
15,
1951.
how
long
before
then
did
you
meet
him
for
the
first
time?”
answer
“for
the
first
time
i
met
him
on
one
occasion
during
the
summer
of
1951.
and
then
it
was
not
until
sometime
later
that
fall,
sometime
again
later
that
fall,
that
i
saw
him
again.”
so
apparently
(inaudible)
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
until
he
came
in
to
the
office
with
this
case
with
respect
to
sherman.
although,
it
is
not
exactly
clear,
but
that's
the
(inaudible)
testimony.
and
he
was
--
he
stated
that
the
man
was
receiving
considerations,
because
of
his
helping
the
government.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
your
honor
to
--
to
record
on
page
114
through
117,
which
is
kalchinian's
testimony
on
cross.
down
near
the
--
just
about
the
middle
of
the
page
record
114,
“and
you
broached
the
subject
to
this
defendant,
did
you
not,
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
case
against
him?”
answer
“for
the
purpose
of
what?”
“making
a
case
against
him."
answer
“no
sir.”
question
“you
were
in
collaboration
with
the
bureau
of
narcotics,
were
you
not?”
answer
“not
at
that
time.”
“were
you,
during
any
of
the
time
that
you
were
approaching
this
defendant?”
answer
“before
that
i
mean
a
few
months
pervious
to
that
or
in
other
cases.”
question
“did
you
ever
speak
to
the
bureau
of
narcotics
about
this
defendant?”
answer
“i
did”,
and
it
was
broken
into
before
the
day
of
arrest.
answer
“i
did
in
the
latter
part
of
the
month
of
october,
yes.”
so,
that
it
appears
that
the
first
time
that
he
comes
in
to
the
government
is
the
1st
of
october.
he's
been
buying
narcotics
three
to
four
times
a
week
for
two
months.
now
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir.
i
cannot
find
it
in
the
charge
of
the
jury
where
i
could
barely
state
that
it
was.
that
to
me,
this
is
one
thing
that
has
never
been
raised
in
this
case
at
any
time.
i
have
never
seen
it.
it
isn't
raised
in
any
of
the
briefs.
it
isn't
raised
in
his
brief,
and
it
isn't
raised
in
the
government's
brief.
but
there
is
evidence
in
here
from
which
you
could
find
that
he
wasn't
cooperating
with
the
government.
he
says
at
the
top
of
page
115,
was
it
your
object
to
cause
his
arrest?
no.
then
he
asked
him,
"did
you
report
it
to
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics?
yes,
i
did.
of
course
he
did.
that's
how
they
made
the
buys.
then
they
go
over,
on
page
116,
and
--
and
mr.
lowenberg
questions
him
again.
“well
you
approached
him
to
supply
narcotics,
yes
or
no?”
answer
“when
i
approached
him
on
the
subject
i
have
nothing
in
my
mind
but
to
supply
myself.”
question
“to
supply
yourself?”
answer
“to
supply
myself
with
narcotics.
that
is
right.
i
needed
it.”
“you
needed
it?”
“that's
right.”
then
they
go
in
to
ask
about
--
it
says,
“and
you
approached
him
for
it?”
answer
“i
asked
him
to
introduce
me
to
his
man."
now,
kalchinian's
testimony
is
replete
with
the
idea
that
all
he
asked
this
defendant
to
do
was
to
introduce
him
to
someone
he
could
buy
narcotics
from
because
he
needed
narcotics
for
his
own
personal
use.
and
that
the
defendant
rather
than
do
that,
sold
him
narcotics
himself.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
on
direct
examination
at
page
71
of
the
record,
sir,
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
“did
the
defendant
ever
call
you
for
this
purpose
after
he
stated
the
place
he
agreed
upon
was
8th
avenue
and
20th
in
the
corner
of
8th
avenue
and
20th
street.
did
the
defendant
ever
call
you
for
this
purpose?”
“yes,
he
did.”
“when
was
the
first
time
that
he
called
on
you?”
“well,
about
the
1st
of
september.”
“and
did
you
set
up
a
meeting
with
him?”
“yes,
i
did.”
“did
he
deliver
narcotics
to
you
that
--
at
that
time?”
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
the
--
the
story
was
that
--
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
sherman
was
buying
narcotics
for
himself.
he
had
a
source
of
supply.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir.
i
understand
that
depending
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
my
understanding
of
the
testimony
of
the
officers
is,
is
that
they
gave
him
$15.
and
then
they
observed
him.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
they
observed
him
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
pass
something
and
receive
something
and
that
at
the
--
on
the
last
sale,
the
third
sale
after
they
arrested
sherman,
they
found
the
$15,
same
$15
on
sherman
that
they
had
found
on
the
--
on
the
--
that
they
had
given
to
kalchinian.
so
that
there
was
a
payment
at
the
time.
it
was
not,
he
was
not
making
him
his
agent
to
go
out
and
buy
it
bring
it
back.
he
was
paying
for
it
that
at
the
time
he
got
it,
is
the
way
i
understand
the
record.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
read
the
record
that
way.
i
read
the
record
that
showed
that
sherman
would
call
him
and
tell
him
he
had
narcotics.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir.
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
he
--
that
he
had
it
to
--
to
deliver
to
him
and
that
he
would
arrange
the
next
day
to
go
down
to
this
place
around
8th
avenue
and
20th
street
and
they
would
meet.
and
--
and
kalchinian
here
would
pay
sherman
for
the
narcotics
at
the
same
time.
i
mean,
there
was
a
sale,
as
transaction,
a
sale,
that
he
actually
gave
him
the
money
at
the
time
he
got
it.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
far
as
i
know,
sir
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
this
is
the
first
time
and
the
first
place
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
what
was
argued
to
the
jury.
the
arguments
are
not
in
here.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
because
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
record
as
i
have
it
here,
will
suggest
that.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
united
states
attorney
overlooked
it
or
what
happened,
your
honor.
as
i
say
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
this
is
--
is
the
first
place
which
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
the
matter
was
brought
up
here,
your
honor,
and
i
wanted
to
refer
you
to
the
record
because
i
do
think
it
is
questionable.
and
as
i
say
i
don't
think
it's
been
raised
before
but
i
do
think
its
questionable.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
think
--
i
think
he
wasn't.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
all
right,
sir.
all
right.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
thought
that
this
court
was
interested
in
that
point
and
that's
why
i
brought
it
up.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now,
according
to
kalchinian's
testimony
that
while
he
had
asked
the
defendant
to
supply
the
name
of
his
party
from
whom
he
could
obtain
narcotics,
the
defendant
didn't
do
that.
instead,
he
suggested
displeasure.
now,
in
this
respect,
i
--
i
must
confess
that
i
read
this
record.
and
there
are
two
ways
you
could
read
it.
one
of
them
you
can
read
it
to
understand
that
as
far
as
kalchinian
was
concerned,
that
the
defendant
offered
it
to
him.
he
offered
to
sell
it
to
him.
but
the
cross-examination
of
mr.
lowenberg
was
based
on
prior
testimony
indicates
again
that
--
that
that
is
a
very
debatable
at
least,
subject
as
to
who
suggested
at
first
that
sherman
sell
the
narcotics
to
--
to
kalchinian.
i
--
i
have
trouble
finding
out
just
exactly
what
the
fact
was.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
that's
--
that's
my
understanding
of
--
of
what
transpired
there.
but
i'm
talking
about
this
prior
arrangement
back
in
august
when
they
first
made
the
arrangement
to
--
to
buy
narcotics.
you
see,
this
--
this
purchase
on
what
this
indictment
is
based
was
made
december
–
december
or
november
1st,
was
the
first
buy.
but
kalchinian
says
that
“i've
--
i
started
buying
for
him
back
in
the
1st
of
september.”
and
so,
the
question
is
whether
he
was
induced
wrongfully
back
the
1st
of
september
to
sell
narcotics
to
kalchinian.
and
kalchinian
says,
“i
asked
him
to
supply
me
with
a
name
or
introduce
me
to
somebody
i
could
get
it
from
and
his
source
and
instead
the
defendant
insisted
on
selling
it
me.”
and
perhaps,
there
was
a
reason.
maybe,
he
wanted
to
make
a
profit.
and
we
--
we
contend
that
in
itself
indicates
some
evidence
of
a
predisposition,
if
the
case
isn't
the
same
as
the
one
we
had
here
before.
here,
there
are
two
discussions
about
the
narcotic
addict.
it
isn't
in
--
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
a
man
who
is,
admittedly,
violating
the
law
with
respect
to
narcotics.
he
is
buying
them.
he
says
i
can
get
it.
he
says
i
have
source.
so,
he
isn't
a
man
too
innocent
in
this.
and
to
show
whether
he
was
a
--
a
person
engaged
in
it
we
brought
the
record
of
his
prior
convictions,
which
was
a
conviction0
for
a
sale
and
a
conviction
for,
as
i
believe,
mr.
lowenberg
points
out
for
a
purchase.
now,
those
two
convictions
together
with
the
evidence
here
that
he
was
a
narcotic
addict
that's
why
he
was
going
to
the
doctor,
he
was
able
to
get
the
drug.
he
was
--
had
been
buying
it.
he
could
get
it
when
kalchinian
couldn't.
he
was
still
dealing
with
narcotics
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
kalchinian
said
that
he
couldn't
that
his
--
and
then
that's
in
here,
at
record
116.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
that
apparently
was
earlier
than
august.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
this
was
june
--
june
or
july.
he
doesn't
say
when.
but
he
said,
“give
me
the
name
you
know
him,”
and
then
he
said,
“well
he
wanted
to
know
the
name
of
this
prior
dealer."
"did
you
cause
his
arrest?”
“no.”
“could
you
give
me
the
name
of
that
dealer?”
“no,
if
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
if
i
know
it
--
his
right
name.”
“give
me
the
name
as
you
know
him
under.”
answer
“nick,
nick,
that's
all
i
knew
him.”
“did
give
you
the
bureau
of
narcotics
his
name,
nick's
name?”
answer
“i
did
not
mention
it
to
the
narcotics
bureau.”
“did
you
give
them
a
description
of
this
man?”
answer
“no.”
then
he
asked,
"do
you
recall
operating
with
the
bureau
of
narcotics
at
that
particular
time?"
“not
at
that
particular
time.”
“not
at
that
particular
time?
did
you
subsequently
--
when
you
started
to
cooperate
then,
were
you
still
getting
narcotics
from
nick?”
“whom
were
you
getting
it
from
then?”
answer
“i
was
not
getting
it
from
anyone.”
“you
mean
you
were
up
at
the
doctor's
office
for
a
cure?”
“that
is
right.”
“and
you
did
not
have
a
cravings
for
narcotics
while
you
were
undergoing
this
cure?
"not
at
the
beginning.
no,
not
at
the
beginning,
no.”
“it
was
only
later
in
the
treatment
that
you
--you
required
this?
answer
“i
was
not
responding
to
treatment
very
well.”
and
then
as
to
the
two
previous
cases
on
record
117,
he
says,
“but
you
did
build
up
two
other
cases?”
“in
some
months
previously,
yes.
"some
months
previously?"
"yes.”
“and
isn't
it
a
fact
that
in
not
going
there
to
nick
but
in
approaching
this
defendant
you
had
in
mind
building
up
a
case
against
the
defendant
to
give
the
bureau
of
narcotics?"
so,
that
it
does
appear
that
at
the
time
he
was
getting
narcotics
from
sherman
and
was
going
to
the
doctor.
he
didn't
have
a
source
of
supply
of
his
own.
he
was
trying
to
get
some
for
himself.
and
that
the
defendant,
rather
than
leading
to
his
own
source,
saw
that
opportunity
to
get
back
into
the
narcotic
business
which
he
had
previously
been
in
1942
and
which
he
--
for
which
he
had
possession
of
narcotics
or
purchase
of
narcotics.
he'd
been
convicted
in
1946.
and
he's
a
man
that's
been
dealing
in
narcotics
or
--
or
addicted
to
narcotics
for
--
for
9
years.
now,
that
--
that
evidence
to
me
has
some
persuasion
in
--
in
whether
he
was
a
person
who
was
again
willing
to
get
into
the
traffic
and
who
was
a
person,
who
was,
otherwise,
an
--
an
innocent
person.
now,
again
i
come
back
to
the
argument
of
entrapment.
that
entrapment
is
a
defense
for
the
innocent,
the
people
that
are
not
engaged
in
crime,
and
not
engaged
in
this
particular
advantage.
it's
not
a
--
a
defense
for
a
fellow
who
is
in
the
business.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir.
there's
no
evidence
in
there
other
than
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
evidence
that
i
can
recall
was
that
he
told
kalchinian
that
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
the
cure.
he
was
trying
to
get
a
cure
but
at
the
time
he
was
buying
narcotics.
so,
i
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
know
if
there
were
or
if
you
should
believe
him
on
that.
but
there
is
no
record
that
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
find
someone
to
sell
narcotics
or
do
anything
in
that
sense,
i
would
say,
your
honor.
but
we
feel
that
this
--
this
evidence
of
prior
offenses
was
admissible.
again
going
to
the
predisposition
of
the
defendant
and
his
guilty
mind
at
the
time
of
the
sales
in
question.
and
again,
the
sorrells
case
is
important
because
as
they
--
as
they
point
out,
once
he
opens
this
door
to
entrapment,
then
the
government
in
such
a
case
can
bring
other
evidence
into
play.
for
example,
they
say,
that
if
the
defendant
seeks
acquittal,
by
reason
of
entrapment,
he
cannot
complain
of
an
appropriate
and
searching
inquiry
into
his
own
conduct
and
predisposition
is
bearing
on
that
issue.
if
in
consequence
he
suffers
a
disadvantage,
he
has
brought
it
upon
himself
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
the
offense.
and
it's
about
just
like
the
fellow
that
puts
his
character
in
evidence
like
we
found
in
the
michelson
case,
where
they
asked
him,
his
character
witnesses
if
they
knew
he'd
been
arrested
in
1920.
and
this
court
held
that
was
all
right
that
he
opened
up
the
issue.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
your
honor,
i
--
i
hesitate
to
say
that
because
i
did
not
see
the
record
in
the
first
trial
but
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
in
200
f.2d,
i
would
say
that
it
is.
as
far
as
i
know,
except
for
the
record
of
the
convictions
and
the
record
of
the
--
of
mr.
lowenberg
for
the
price
paid
for
the
narcotics
and
the
--
and
the
fact
that
he
had
previously
purchased
the
same
amount
for
a
lesser
price
that
is,
and
he
testified,
i
think,
that
he
got
the
same
amount
for
$10
from
his
other
places
where
he
could
purchase.
in
other
words,
this
man
had
been
an
addict.
and
he
bought
narcotics
before
so
that
there
is
some
evidence
in
there
to
show
that
sherman
was
in
the
business
for
profit
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
that
there
was
not
in
the
first
place.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
no,
sir.
i
did
not
find
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
that.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
think
that
the
government
would
have
any
such
right
there.
well,
i
think
that
it's
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
don't
think
so,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
he
--
as
--
as
kalchinian's
testimony,
as
i
read
it,
is
that
he,
the
defendant
offered
to
sell
it
to
him.
he
tried
to
find
who
defendant
--
his
source
of
supply.
and
--
and
instead
the
defendant
offered
to
sell
it
to
him.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
as
i
say,
there
maybe
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
some
question
on
that,
but
that's
the
way
i
read
the
record.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
that's
right.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
well,
that's
--
that's
about
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
as
i
--
as
i
read
the
testimony,
your
honor,
that's
about
the
size
of
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
if
you
think
it
over
it's
about
the
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
--
size
of
it,
but
kalchinian
insists
i
didn't
ask
him
to
sell
it
to
me.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
and
now
i
mean
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
yes.
that
maybe
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
he
wanted
him
to
tell
him
where
he
could
get
it.
i
think
there's
a
distinction
there.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
oh,
i
don't
think
it
made
any
difference
to
him
how
he
got
it.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
but
as
his
--
his
testimony
is
that
he
asked
him
to
--
to
put
him
in
touch
with
a
source
and
did
not
ask
him
to
sell
him
the
narcotics.
mr.
james
w.
knapp
now,
that
--
mr.
james
w.
knapp
all
right,
sir.
is
there
any
other
--
