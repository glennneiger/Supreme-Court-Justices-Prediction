i'm
curious
as
to
why
you
say
it
would
not
be
a
sale
in
the
situation
hypothesized
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
is
a
fallacy.
this
is
or
was
sale
because
there
was
no
profit?

and
that
as
i
understand
it
was
for
half
the
cost
of
the
heroin
plus
reimbursement
to
sherman
for
taxi

(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
or
understood
(inaudible)
argument
of
the
counsel
for
petitioner
that
there
is
no
question
about
that.
that
on
each
of
the
three
instances
of
questioning,
sherman
had
gotten
$25,
$25
worth
of
heroin
and
then
by
arrangement
met
kalchinian
on
the
street
corner
and
passed
over
what
was
supposed
to
be
half
of
the
$25
worth
of
heroin,
asked
then,
kalchinian
to
pay
him
$15,
that
which
covered
one
half
of
the
cost
of
heroin,
plus
the
$2.50
taxi
cab
fee.
i
am
sure,
that's
quite

for
