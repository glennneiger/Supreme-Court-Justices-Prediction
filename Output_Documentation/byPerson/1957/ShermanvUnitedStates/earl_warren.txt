record
to
show
what
the

man
did
with
his
share
of
it?
did
he
--
did
he
use
it
himself,
presumably,
or
did
he
turn
it
in
to
the
government?
do
you
know?
chief

yes.
chief
justice
earl

yes.

warren
yes,
but
the
informant

he
wasn't
turning
it
over
to

(inaudible)
chief

to
that,
i'll
just
interrupt
one
more.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
--
whether
this
informer
had
actually
induced
other
addicts
to

drug
addicts?

drug
addicts?

and
that
under

wasn't
there
something
on

also
following
--
following
that
or
the
question
is
do
you
remember
this
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
so
please
read
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
question
“and
it
was
your
job
while
working
with
these
agents
to
go
out
and
try
and
induce
a
person
to
sell
narcotics
to
you,
isn't
that
correct?”
answer
“i
would
say
yes
to
that.
now
do
you
remember
that,
if
that
is
what
i
said
let
it
stand
just
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
a
little
different
from
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
he
says
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
after
he
has
confirmed
it
with
that
question
and
that
answer.
he
says,
yes,
--
he
says,
“if
i
said
that,
if
that
is
what
i
said,
let
it
stand
just
that
way.”
and
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
question
now
when
you
look
at
this,
the
court,
he
said,
“let
it
stand
just
that
way.
”the
witness
"i
take
your
word
for
it.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
to
tell
you,
this
--
this
page

just
doesn't
bear
out
what
you
started
again
to
tell
us
mr.
knapp.
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i've
read
the
whole
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i've
read
--
i've
read
the
whole
thing
now
and
it
just
doesn't
bear
that
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
you
say,
mr.
knapp,
that
he
made
two
cases
for
the
government
before
the
sales
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
and
i
understood
what
he
was
saying.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
kalchinian
then
couldn't
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
is
june,
the
same
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
supposing
that,
isn't
it
also
fair
reasoning
that
if
it
is
wrong
for
the
--
for
the
government
to
try
to
induce
a
strong-minded,
innocent
person
to
commit
a
crime,
when
he
finally
succumbs
to
it,
that
it
is
more
wrong
for
the
government
to
try
to
induce
a
poor
addict
who
is
struggling
with
himself
and
is
--
is
going
to
a
doctor
everyday
in
order
to
try
to
break
himself
of
the
habit,
and
can
you
say
that
--
can
you
say
that
the
--
the
mere
fact
that
the
man
is
an
addict,
gives
the
government
the
--
the
right
to
induce
him
to
commit
this
crime
just
because
he's
a
person
who
might
be
likely
to
succumb?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
haven't
you
got
that
--
haven't
you
got
that
situation
here,
mr.
knapp?
you've
got
this
--
this
poor
fellow,
both
of
them
poor
fellows,
who
are
sitting
in
this
--
in
this
doctor's
office,
both
of
them
trying
to
break
themselves
of
this
habit.
and
one
of
them
who
is
connected
up
with
the
--
with
the
government,
narcotic
bureau
for
some
reason
or
other,
whether
it's
money
or
whether
it's
--
it's
influence
or
perhaps
leniency
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
bureau,
one
of
them
chooses
to
cooperate
with
--
with
the
government
in
making
these
cases.
and
he
induces
some
poor
devil
who
is
in
that
office
trying
to
break
himself
of
the
habit
under
a
doctor's
--
doctor's
care.
now,
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
entrapment,
shouldn't
that
be
entrapment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
read
this
and
i
don't
think
it'll
bear
that
out
mr.
knapp.
the
man,
kalchinian
admits,
i
don't
want
to
go
all
over
this
because
it's
pretty
late,
but
as
i
read
it,
kalchinian,
first
approached
him
in
the
office,
asked
him
how
he
was
doing,
and
then
told
him
--
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
him
where
he
could
get
some.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
told
him
he
needed
it
badly.
and
finally,
on
about
the
third
or
fourth
time,
this
man
said,
well
i
can't
introduce
you
to
anybody,
but
i
can
get,
maybe
get
you
some.
and
i'll
share
it
with
you,.
and
then
he
went
and
--
he
went
and
got
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now
when
you
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
a
play
on
words,
it
seems
to
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
--
he
wanted
this
man
to
go
out
and
get
for
him.
that's
what
you
--
that's
the
purpose
of
his
questioning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
why
didn't
he
stay
with
that?
why
didn't
he
stay
with
it?
what
--
what
difference
would
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
he
wouldn't
have
taken
it
the
easy
way,
that
is,
if
this
man
could
get
it
for
him,
that
he
would
insist
on
wanting
to
go
and
buy
it
himself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
--
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
say
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

one
more
case
on
the
calendar,

monday
afternoon
or

it
continued
to
the
february
calendar
chief

a
summary
case.

let
us
know
after
we
--
after
we
adjourn
