the

the
conviction

transaction
which
they
shared?
justice

before

as
you
justify
to
the
chief
justice
when

was
on

own.
justice

the

is
for
that?
justice

the

the
conviction
is
for

do
you

do
you
agree
on
this?
the

it

it?
justice

but
i
mean
--
but
if
the
case
is
the
position
--
justice

frankfurter
--
there's
nothing
that
the
government
did
to
kalchinian
as
its
agent,
barely
to
be
deemed
to
be
an
entrapment
of
sherman,
because
in
fact
the
five
transactions
between
kalchinian
and
sherman
and
kalchinian
was
on
his
own,
showed
that
sherman
was
in
a
predisposed
state
of
mind.
was
that
the
position
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
your
point.
what
i
mean,
is
that
the
position
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
they
say
there's
no
entrapment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
during
--
during
this
period,
after
he
was
convicted
and
between
the
november
transaction,
was
that
the
$25
transaction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--the
conviction
of
kalchinian
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
november
transaction,
would
you
state
with
as
much
particularity
as
the
record
permits
you
to
state,
what
kalchinian's
relation
to
the
government
or
narcotics
bureau
was
both
in
--
in
the
human
transaction
and
in
monetary
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
--
what
you
say
that
when
kalchinian
approached
sherman,
when
he
said
that
it
isn't
working
and
he
needs
relief,
that
that
was
prompted
by
his
own
need
and
not
all
instigated
or
suggested
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
bureau,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
appear
that
any
--
did
the
record
disclose
any
remuneration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
did
the
transactions
for
which
the
conviction
was
had,
take
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
when
was
the
$25
transaction
which
he's
not,
for
which
he
was
not
prosecuted,
his
sharing
transaction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
he
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
know
that.
justice

(inaudible)
justice

successive
$25
--
justice
felix

on
what?
justice
felix

all
of
them
$25
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
of
them
shared.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
i
may.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose,this
transaction
between
sherman
and
kalchinian
had
taken
place
between
sherman
and
another
addict,
absolutely
disassociated
from
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
under
--
with
the
same
kind
of
a
plea,
sherman
would
then
have
divided
heroin
the
way
he
did
with
kalchinian.
would
that
have
been
a
--
a
violation
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
it
is
not
a
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
lowenberg,
what
i
don't
understand
is
assuming
you're
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
does
it
become
a
sale
if
these
--
if
these
kinds
of
action
takes
place
with
a
government
agent?
why
does
that
--
it
--
make
it
a
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
must
say
i'm
doubtful.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
transaction
can
--
the
litmus
paper
to
test
can
be
different,
whether
what
i
do
to
a
fellow
who
pretends
to
be
an
addict
and
i
divide
it
without
a
penny
of
profit
or
he
is
in
fact
an
addict
and
i
divide
it
out
of
sheer
compassion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
this
--
how
can
the
legal
transaction
change
whether
i
am
a
fool
in
thinking
a
man
is
an
addict
or
he's
a
real
addict?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
this
case
--
but
in
this
case,
i'm
puzzled.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
relevant
or
a
subsequent
one.
the
government
agent
held
himself
out,
represented
himself
to
be
an
addict
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
appealed
to
sherman
to
help,
to
relieve
him
of
his
affliction,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
--
so
why
is
it
a
sale
on
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
a
sale
in
the
view
that
you
take
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wasn't
he
convicted
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
why
is
it
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
was
by
a
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
were
there
--
were
there
subsequent
ones
that
are
free
of
this
question,
what
is
and
is
not
a
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
subsequent
transactions
were
they
also
the
same
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
urge
below
that
entrapment
or
no
entrapment,
this
wasn't
within
the
statue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
was
not
a
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
kalchinian
had
given
sherman
$25
or
$15,
you
know
somebody
and
here
is
$15,
go
and
get
it.
would
that
be
--
what
would
that
be
under
the
law?
certainly
not
a
sale?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
this
is
the
same
kind
of
a
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
instead
of
--
instead
of
offering
the
money
in
advance
he
reimbursed
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
you
say
the
court
--
because
you
said
that
this
is
a
sale
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
not
raising
--
that
question
isn't
before
us,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
question
is
not
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
has
this
question
failed
or
not?
was
that
before
a
judge
in
the,
in
the
first
sherman
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
first
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
assumed
it
wasn't
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
case
mr.
lowenberg
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that
i've
looked
at
the
indictment
and
the
sales
thing
is
naturally
out
of
business
here
because
it
says,
received,
concealed,
sell,
or
facilitate
--
and
facilitate
the
transportation
et
cetera,
so.
but
your
case
is
this,
that
although
this
--
this
man
kalchinian
was
in
fact
an
addict
who's
himself
sought
to
be
cured
but
he
also
at
the
same
time
was
in
the
service
of
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
particularly
of
the
narcotics
bureau.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
talked
to
a
fellow
addict
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
one
addict
might
talk
to
another
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
fact
at
the
time
that
he
did
so,
he
also
as
a
servant
of
the
--
one
of
the
government
and
by
the
testimony
that
you
think
is
sufficient
was
under
an
arrangement
if
he
could
to
bring
violators
of
the
law
to
the
notice
or
to
be
convicted
to
be
--
attention
of
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
he
was
an
addict,
talking
as
one
addict
to
another
doesn't
strip
him
of
--
of
the
fact
that
he
is
also
acting
for
the
government
at
the
same
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
--
what
evidence
according
to
your
view
was
there
at
the
second
trial
bearing
on
predisposition
that
was
not
present
in
the
first
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
date
that
you've
just
given?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
it
was
undisputed
kalchinian
had
been
an
addict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
presumably
an
addict
is
a
person
who
somehow
rather
gets
a
hold
of
forbidden
fruit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
wasn't
any
question,
was
there
that's
mr.
(inaudible)
there
isn't
any
--
it
is
not
in
dispute
that
--
that
these
two
people
sherman
and
kalchinian
met
in
a
bona
fide
doctor's
office
whose
speciality
was
treating
addicts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
evidence
from
your
point
of
view?
is
there
any
supporting
evidence
for
that
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knapp,
i
don't
mean
to
take
words
out
of
an
opinion
and
treat
them
as
sacred,
but
taking
judge
hand's
opinion
in
the
first
sherman
case,
"therefore,
in
such
cases
two
questions
of
fact
arise.
that
one,
did
the
agent
induce
the
accused
to
commit
the
offense
charged
in
the
indictment.
two,
if
so,
was
the
accused
ready
and
willing
without
persuasion,
and
was
he
awaiting
any
fortuitous
opportunity
to
commit
the
offense?"
now,
what
is
there
in
this
record
to
sustain
any
allowable
inference
by
a
jury
that
this
fellow,
sherman,
was
awaiting
a
fortuitous
opportunity
to
commit
the
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
--
by
the
government
agent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
one
can't
say
without
denial
that
he
was
contemporaneously
a
government
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
state
what
your
--
what
--
can
you
state
your
understanding
of
the
relations
between
--
the
relations
between
kalchinian
and
the
narcotics
bureau
from
the
moment
that
they
had
a
relationship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
assume
that
there
is
no
contract
between
them,
nothing
in
writing
between
the
narcotics
bureau
and
those
and
its
informant.
that
it's
a
verbal
arrangement
through
a
course
of
business.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
to
go
in
there
and
tell
him
about
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i,
in
dealing
with
the
question
whether
this
man
was
a
government
agent,
you
say
that
nobody,
that
sort
of,
as
we
have
to
deal
with
it,
everybody
in
this
litigation
isn't
that
what
you've
indicated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
knapp,
the
problem,
the
defense
if
you
call
it
such,
the
defense
of
entrapment
can
only
arrive
if
the
government
agent
is
involved.
and
if
you
say
the
government
neither
on
the
first
trial
nor
on
the
second
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
first
appeal
or
second,
raised
the
question,
it
must
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
was
a
government
agent.
otherwise,
the
entrapment
defense
had
no
basis
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
i
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
that
for
once
--
for
once
a
negative
is
a
--
a
positive,
that
if
the
government
would
not
have
accepted,
would
not
have
assumed
or
found
in
the
evidence
sufficient
basis
for
concluding
that
this
fellow
was
a
government
agent,
it
couldn't
have
been
indifferent
to
what
is
basic
to
the
beginning
of
a
defense
of
entrapment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
the
--
but
that
you
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
no
matter,
the
government
does
--
a
us
attorney
or
an
assistant
attorney
or
a
first
year
law
student
knows
entrapment
means
something
supposedly
done
by
government
agents.
and
if
that
--
that
question
isn't
contested
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
presumably
fair.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
say
that
it
isn't
raisable
and
that's
because
i've
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
abstained
and
now
say,
oh,
well,
but
there's
no
issue
of
entrapment
because
he
wasn't
a
government
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
let
me
--
i
can
assure
you've
been
interesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
the
prior
conviction
--
but
for
the
prior
conviction,
the
case
would
be
the
same
it
was
at
the
first

would
it
not?

there
is

the

didn't
affirmatively
direct

there?
