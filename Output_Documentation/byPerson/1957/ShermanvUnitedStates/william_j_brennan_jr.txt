didn't

didn't
you
say
that
before
this
first
meeting
in
the
doctor's
office

justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
they
--
when
they
met
in
the
doctor's
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
kalchinian
had
been
asked
by
the
government
agents
to
be
on
the
look
out
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
before
the
first
time
kalchinian
and
sherman
ever
met.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
do
you
mean
he
was
on
his
own?
i
don't
follow
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
by
that
i
mean,
that
what
--
that
what
i
gathered
from
the
judge's
question
was
just
this.
whether,
at
that
time,
when
sherman
had
divided
with
kalchinian
these
narcotics
and
had
no
report.
kalchinian
didn't
report
it
for
about
a
month
to
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics,
see,
and
was
using
it.
that
he
was
on
his
own
from
that
standpoint,
but
kalchinian
was
an
informer
for
the
government
from
the
--
june,
1951
and
these
sales
took
place
in
november,
1951.
in
other
words
when
kalchinian
pleaded
guilty
in
june,
1951,
to
the
charge
of
unlawfully
selling
narcotics
through
sales
to
an
individual,
he
agreed
at
that
time
to
serve
the
federal
bureau
of
narcotics
and
continued
to
do
so
and
admitted
under
cross
examination
that
he
had
built
up
three
cases.
and
that
it
was
his
purpose
to
go
out
and
induce
people
to
try
to
sell
to
him
narcotics.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
again
that's
three
cases.
was
this
then
the
fourth
case
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
did
--
when
did
kalchinian
report
that
he
and
sherman
were
sharing
these
$25
amounts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
october,
and
what
was,
kalchinian
told
to
go
--
go
on
continue
with
it
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
approach
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought

thought
they
were
