mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
may
it
please
the
court,
i
shall
submit
to
your
honors
three
propositions,
first
that
long
ago
it
became
the
duty
of
the
defendant
to
prescribe
reduced
tolls,
second
that
the
defendant
having
failed
to
perform
that
duty,
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
a
judgment
to
compel
it
to
do
so
and
third
that
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
damages
for
the
defendants'
unlawful
delay.
preliminarily
i
want
to
explain
why
we
are
asking
for
reduced
tolls
in
a
period
of
generally
rising
prices.
the
reason
is
this
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
[laughter]
well
it
wouldn't
be
in
accordance
with
my
argument
as
outlined,
but
if
that's
your
honors
pleasure,
i'd
happy
to
do
it.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
let
me
say
this
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
our
position
is
that
insofar
as
compulsion
is
concerned
the
question
of
presidential
review,
that
is
to
say
a
judicial
review
of
presidential
action
is
not
yet
before
the
court.
at
the
present
time
we're
merely
trying
to
compel
action
on
that
phase
of
the
case
and
for
instance
in
chicago
and
southern
air
lines
against
waterman
which
is
a
case
upon
which
my
learned
friend
relies,
where
it
was
held
the
president's
action
was
not
reviewable
nevertheless
the
law
indicates
that
if
the
civil
aeronautics
board
which
was
the
subordinate
agency
in
that
case
had
simply
sat
on
a
proceeding
for
something
like
seven
years
and
taken
no
action,
the
courts
would
have
had
power
to
compel
it
to
act
to
move
along,
as
for
instance
in
virginia
railway
against
system
federation
or
wilbur
against
krushnic
or
interstate
commerce
commission
against
humboldt
steam
ship
company
or
in
payne
against
new
mexico
all
of
which
are
cases
where
the
subordinate
agency
had
filed
to
act
or
failed
to
act
in
accordance
with
a
correct
construction
of
the
statute.
and
the
courts
compel
the
subordinate
agency
to
act
in
accordance
with
a
correct
construction
of
the
statute
although
the
court
had
no
power
to
review
the
action
when
taken.
so
here
we
say
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
it
is
quite
true
that
this
statute
does
not
in
specific
terms
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
go
before
the
courts
and
compel
this
action.
but
this
statute
does
impose
upon
this
defendant
in
the
most
explicit
terms
a
duty
and
of
course
my
learned
friend
said
that
we
haven't
got
standing
to
sue
but
the
hay-pauncefote
treaty
which
is
incorporated
in
this
statute
made
a
matter
of
domestic
law
for
the
first
time
says
that
vessels
of
commerce
shall
be
entitled
to
just
an
equitable
tolls
and
we
say
that
a
user
who
is
entitled
to
reasonable
rates
has
a
standing
to
sue
to
enforce
a
particular
statutory
right.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
that
is
true
your
honor
but
those
are
matters
of
executive
policy.
we
say
this
is
a
matter
of
executive
administration
of
legislative
policy.
rate
may
be
is
a
legislative
function.
here
congress
has
defined
a
policy
and
imposed
upon
this
defendant
a
duty
to
execute
it.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
your
honor
there
are
a
couple
of
answers
to
that.
we
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
compel
the
process
to
get
going
in
any
event
whatever
maybe
the
power
of
the
president
and
that
comes
under
cases
such
as
virginia
railway
and
system
federation.
we
further
say
even
if
that
that
there
is
--
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
courts
have
power
of
judicial
review
after
the
action
of
the
president,
but
whether
we
are
right
or
wrong
on
that
we
say
that
the
long
line
of
cases
which
say
that
a,
that
a
--
someone
who
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
a
statute,
someone
for
whose
benefit
a
particular
statute
has
enacted
has
the
power
to
compel
an
agency
or
a
private
corporation
and
this
defendant
is
subjected
to
suit
like
any
private
corporation
that
the
courts
under
those
circumstances
if
the
suit
have
such
person
for
whose
benefit
the
statute
was
enacted
may
compel
the
action
commanded
by
the
statute.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
your
honor
we
don't
think
that
the
president
can
the
next
day
may
nullify
it
and
we
think
that
even
in
such
cases
such
as
--
take
for
instance
--
well
we
have
a
variety
of
positions
your
honor.
let's
take
norwegian
nitrogen
products
against
united
states
that
was
a
case
where
the
president
was
to
construe
the
statute
beyond
judicial
review
and
yet
this
court
took
jurisdiction
over
the
procedure
and
wrote
an
opinion
28
pages
long
reviewing
the
procedure
of
the
tariff
commission.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
[attempt
to
laughter]
well
the
upshot
of
the
28
pages
was
that
the
tariff
commission
had
acted
properly
according
to
the
law.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
the
court
held
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
up
to
the
president,
but
the
court
did
say,
the
courts
did
review
the
procedure
and
found
that
the
procedure
of
the
tariff
commission
had
been
correct.
i
think
perhaps
your
honor,
your
honor
may
have
in
mind
a
case,
united
states
against
george
s.
bush
&
company,
which
is
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
or
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
further
proceedings
in
accordance
with
the
opinion.
now
the
opinion
at
page,
pages
248,
249
adopts
our
theory
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
could
i
not
develop
the
meaning
of
the
statute
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
excuse
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
your
honor
we
do
claim
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
review
after
the
president
has
acted,
but
we
also
say
that
--
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
we
think,
we
say
that
theoretically
there
are
three
possible
interpretations
of
the,
of
the
president's
review
power
proviso,
first
that
the
president
may
act
according
to
his
own
whim
or
fancy.
we
think
for
reasons
which
i
shall
explain
that
that
theory
is
not
appropriate.
second
possible
theory
is
that
the
president
was
to
enforce
the
statute
according
to
law,
according
to
his
definition
of
the
law,
but
beyond
judicial
review
that
is
the
norwegian
nitrogen
products
or
george
s.
bush
type
of
situation.
a
third
theory
is
that
the
action
of
the
president
is
subject
to
judicial
review
for
errors
of
law
or
misinterpretation
of
a
statute,
a
limited
power
of
review,
but
we
say
that
whatever
the
power,
the
president
of
the
power
--
the
power
of
the
president
maybe
the
courts
have
the
power
to
compel
this
defendant
to
act
to
get
the
administrative
process
underway.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
[attempt
to
laughter]
well
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
your
honor
excuse
me
your
honor.
the
administrative
procedure
act
defines
agency
action
to
include
failure
to
act.
we
say
the
administrative
procedure
act
authorizes
the
courts
to
compel
agency
action
unlawfully,
unreasonably
--
unlawfully
withheld
or
unreasonably
delayed.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
i
think.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
i
think
both
parties
agree
on
that
i
maybe
mistaken.
i
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
i
may
have
misunderstood
his
argument,
as
i
read
his
brief
he
--
in
fact
well
i'll
put
it
this
way,
perhaps
i'll
take
that
back,
i'll
say
this.
as
i
understand
the
theory
of
the
defendant
it
is
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
precludes
judicial
review,
i
am
sorry,
i
guess
i
misstated
it.
it
applies
in
the
sense
that
it,
that
it
precludes
review
only
in
that
sense.
but
we
say
that
we
have
a
right
to
compel
this
defendant
to
act
both
as
a
private
corporation
under
ordinary
case
law
and
as
a
united
states
agency
under
both
case
law
and
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now
may
i
explain
it,
i'll
just
very
briefly
–
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
excuse
me,
refer
to
why,
why
the
theory
of
rising
prices,
to
come
back
where
i
was,
we
are
asking
for
reduced
tolls.
the
reason
there
is
a
tremendous
increase
in
traffic
through
the
canal.
the
traffic
has
increased
from
20
odd
million
tons
to
40
million
odd
tons
or
20
million
odd
tons
in
1947
the
last
year
before
the
agitation
that
resulted
the
act
of
september
26th
1950
and
1957
which
was
last
year.
defendant
--
tolls
and
toll
credits
amounted
to
90
million
odd
in
1947
and
amounted
to
39
million
odd
in
1957
representing
an
increase
in
traffic
as
i
say
from
approximately
20
million
odd
tons
to
40
million
odd
tons.
now
the
defendant
operates
on
pretty
much
fixed
cost.
it
cost
very
little
(inaudible)
20
ships
a
day
through
the
canal
and
to
get
only
10
and
the
direct
expense
of
operating
the
canal
has
gone
from
only
14
million
odd
dollars,
to
16
million
odd
dollars.
so
that
on
a
per
tonnage
basis,
the
cost,
the
cost
per
ton
of
getting
a
ship
through
the
canal
or
getting
a
ton
through
the
canal
has
very
much
decreased.
now
the
act
of
september
26,
1950,
relates
tolls
to
cost
and
the
cost
per
ton,
having
gone
down
so
much,
we
say
that
tolls
also
should
go
down,
and
in
fact
there
has
been
the
same
increase
at
suez
and
at
suez
rates
have
been
reduced
to
40%
in
the
post
war
period.
the
defendant
in
his
brief
relates
this
situation
somehow
to
suez
and
yet
the
fact
is
that
if
rates
here
were
reduced
by
the
full
0.25
cents
a
ton,
indicated
by
the
comptroller
general's
report,
rates
at
panama
would
still
be
higher,
relative
to
suez
rates
than
they
were
either
in
1937,
when
the
present
panama
rate
was
fixed
or
in
1948,
when
the
legislative
process,
legislative
history
of
this
act
began.
now
my
first
proposition
is
that
long
ago
it
came
to
duty
of
this
defendant
to
prescribe
reduce
tolls
and
i
say
that
because
the
statute
compels,
directs
this
defendant
to
prescribe
tolls
on
the
basis
of
canal
activity
and
without
regard
to
the
losses
of
the
so
called
business
activities.
now
if
i
am
correct
in
that
construction
of
the
statute,
then
the
comptroller
general's
report
establishes
beyond
all
doubt,
that
on
a
canal
activity
basis,
the
present
rate
is
far
excessive,
that
collections
under
this
rate
far
exceed
the
cost
prescribed
or
defined
in
the
tolls
formulated
laid
down
by
act
of
september
26th.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
your
honor.
the
only
significance
of
the
comptroller
general's
report
is
evidence.
the
comptroller
general's
report
provided
evidence
which
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
this
defendant
had
concealed
by
ambiguous
bookkeeping,
that's
the
characterization
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
comptroller
general
provided
the
evidence.
we
don't
rely
upon
the
comptroller
general's
report
for
the
construction
of
the
law.
we
get
our
construction
of
the
law
from
the
legislative
history
and
from
the
language
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
it
was
the
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
in
this
sense
that
the
comptroller
general's
report
provides
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
no
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
evidence
that
the
present
rate
far
exceeds
the
statutory
rate,
that
they
had
been
collecting
far
more
money
than
was
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
relevant
as
evidence
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
don't
understand
it
even
in
this
court,
there
is
any
challenge
to
the
comptroller
general's
report
as
evidence.
i
find
nothing
in
the
brief
of
the
defendant
company
in
this
court
which
challenges
the
analysis
as
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
i
would
say
that
your
honor,
it
was
correct
in
that
–
the
district
judge
never
got
to
the
merits,
because
he
held
--
the
district
judge
held
three
things,
first
that
the
statute
permitted
the
defendant
to
charge
the
existing
rate
as
long
as
it
was
content
to
do
so,
that
from
his
expression,
content.
he
again
held
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
and
the
third
he
held
that
we
had
standing
to
sue,
so
never
got
to
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
your
honor
and
we
don't
rely
on
his
illegal
construction.
we
only
rely
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
your
honor
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
district
court
never
got
to
these
questions.
i
always
argue
that,
that
in
the
district
court
what
the
government
did
was
make
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment.
at
any
rate
that
was
the
way
it
was
treated
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
there
was
a
government
affidavit
and
by
reason
of
that
--
that
government
affidavit
gave
various
excuses
or
explanations
why
it
had
not
prescribed
tolls
earlier.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
there
was
not
your
honor.
but
i
--
although
the
defendant
here
has
written
a
long
brief
and
has
got
into
a
--
gone
into
the
bookkeeping
to
a
considerable
extent,
i
do
not,
i
maybe
mistaken,
but
i
do
not
understand
that
the
comptroller
general's
analysis
is
challenged
once
it
be
assumed
that
the
defendant
was
required
by
the
statute
to
prescribe
tolls
on
the
basis
of
the
canal
activity
and
without
regard
to
the
losses
of
the
business
activities.
mr.
rankin
can
correct
me
if
i'm
mistaken.
i
find
nothing
in
the
brief
which
challenges
the
comptroller
general's
analysis
as
a
correct
analysis
upon
that
assumption.
now
our
reason
is
the
same
that
the
act
of
september
26,
1950,
directed
that
tolls
be
prescribed
on
the
basis
of
the
canal
activity
and
not
--
and
without
regard
to
the
losses
of
the
business
activities
are
as
i
say
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
and
defendants
own
admissions,
and
let
me
first
take
up
the
legislative
history.
the
act
of
september
26,
1950
can
be
understood
only
in
the
light
of
the
situation
as
it
existed
at
that
time,
because
that
act
was
passed
to
deal
with
a
particular
situation,
as
i
suppose
all
statutes
are.
now
in
1948
the
canal
authorities
proposed
an
increased
toll.
now
at
that
time
the
toll
was
$0.90
a
laden
ton,
having
been
so
fixed
by
the
president
in
1937,
pursuant
to
the
act
of
that
august
24,
1937
which
authorized
the
president
to
fix
tolls
at
not
less
than
$0.75
and
not
more
than
$1
per
laden
ton.
the
panama
canal,
the
waterway
itself
was
being
operated
by
an
unincorporated
agency
called
the
panama
canal.
the
panama
canal
also
conducted
the
local
government
in
the
canal
zone
and
it
further
conducted
certain
business
operations
such
as
a
shipyard,
a
printing
press
and
so
on.
now
this
is
a
key
feature
in
the
legislative
history.
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government
was
a
great
deal
more
than
it
otherwise
would
be,
because
of
the
presence
of
armed
forces,
large
units
of
the
armed
forces
in
the
canal
zone.
as
your
honors
are
undoubtedly
aware,
the
canal
zone
is
not
only
the
site
of
a
canal,
but
it
is
also
a
very
important
military
base,
and
more
than
half
the
population
of
the
zone
consists
of
the
armed
forces
and
their
dependants.
now
the
cost
to
the
government,
the
canal
zone
government
was
a
great
deal
more
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been,
because
of
the
presence
of
these
troops
and
their
dependants,
more
schools
were
necessary,
more
hospitals
were
necessary,
more
police,
larger
highways,
more
highway
maintenance
and
so
on.
now
a
third
feature
was
that
at
that
time
the
panama
railroad
company,
defendant
or
it's
predecessor
was
operating
other
business
activities.
the
railroad,
the
shipping
line,
commissaries,
these
other
business
activities
had
been
profitable
for
many
years,
and
they
paid
large
sums
in
dividends
to
the
united
states
treasury.
these
business
activities
served
the
canal
as
such
and
also
the
armed
forces
and
also
the
republic
of
panama
and
the
public
generally.
and
a
fourth
feature,
although
perhaps
only
a
detail
but
an
important
detail
is
that
defendants
reports
were
on
an
activity
basis,
that
is
to
say
the
defendants
in
its
budget
program
submitted
to
congress
and
its
annual
reports,
broke
down
each
activity
according
to
net
results
after
the
allocation
of
general
expense,
so
anyone
looking
at
these
reports
could
tell
the
final
result,
financial
result
of
that
particular
activity
considering
all
factors
including
general
expense.
now,
when
the
canal
authorities
proposed
this
increase,
the
shipping
industry
protested
on
this
ground
that
the
additional
cost,
the
higher
cost
which
were
the
justification
for
the
proposed
increase
were
higher
governmental
cost,
military
cost,
commercial
cost
and
not
higher
cost
of
ship
transits.
now
congress
recognized
force
to
that
objection
and
after
three
years
of
consideration
by
the
bureau
of
the
budget
and
various
congressional
committees,
the
court
of
appeals
said
three
years
were
spent
hammering
out
a
formula.
the
net
result
was
the
act
of
september
26,
1950;
that
provided
for
the
transfer
of
the
canal
as
a
waterway
to
the
defendant.
and
in
connection
with
tolls,
it
provided
that
the
toll
should
be
based
upon
the
canal
activity,
plus
an
appropriate
share
of
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government,
the
appropriate
share
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
gross
revenues.
it
was
recognized
that
this
formula
would
result
in
tolls
going
up
and
down
from
time
to
time
according
to
fluctuations
in
costs
and
canal
traffic.
now
that
left
open
the
question
of
who
would
pay
the
remaining
share
of
the
cost
of
canal
zone
government,
and
it
was
decided
that,
that
remaining
share
should
be
paid
by
the
business
activities,
that
is
to
say
the
railroad,
shipping
line,
commissaries
and
so
forth,
which
as
i
say
had
been
profitable
over
a
period
of
many
years.
now,
may
i
ask
your
honors
refer
to
page
of
167
of
the
record,
which
pages
164
to
167
set
forth
the
report
of
the
armed
services
committee
to
the
senate
on
the
bill
which
became
the
act
of
september
26,
1950.
now
your
honors
will
note
on
the
upper
right-hand
side
of
page,
on
the
upper
part
of
page
167,
a
worksheet
setting
forth
the
anticipated
results
of
the
formula
which
was
embodied
in
the
bill.
now
the
significant
feature
of
this
worksheet
is
that
those
are
canal
activity
figures
and
not
company
wide
figures.
if
the
formula
would
be
on
a
company
wide
basis,
the
figures
would
be
a
great
deal
larger,
would
be
around
$90
million,
$80
million
to
$100
million.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
that
is
the
pilot
charges.
the
canal,
not
only
charges
tolls,
but
it
also
charges
a
fee
for
piloting
a
ship
through
the
canal
or
certain
small
marine
services
which
run
to
approximately,
well
less
than
10%
of
tolls.
but,
[laughter]
the
outside
revenue
does
not
include
the
business
activities,
those
would
run
the
figures
way,
way
up.
now
i
would
also
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
the
paragraph
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
all
of
the
above
figures
are
stated
in
round
numbers
and
are
based
on
currently
available
financial
data,
and
then
is
this
significant
sentence
.the
toll
rate
will
of
course
be
affected
by
any
future
changes
in
operating
costs,
interest
rates
and
canal
traffic
and
maybe
revised
either
up
or
down.
now
i
further
ask
that
your
honors
examine
the
first
two
full
sentences
on
page
166,
of
the
top
of
page
166,
the
remaining
cost
to
the
civil
government,
that
is
after
the
appropriate
share
of
the
canal
activity,
would
be
borne
by
the
other
business
activities
such
as
hotels,
commissaries
and
so
on.
as
a
result
the
canal
will
be
on
a
self-sustaining
basis
on
the
other
collateral
business
operating
in
the
canal
zone
must
bear
their
proportionate
share
of
the
cost
to
the
civil
government,
health
and
sanitation.
now,
so
much
for
the
legislative
history;
i've
only
hit
the
high
spots.
now,
then
the
statute
was
enacted
and
i'll
read
to
your
honors
section
412(b)
which
is
the
key
provision
of
the
statute
as
we
see
it.
that's
in
section
412,
which
is
entitled
‘basis
of
tolls'.
tolls
shall
be
prescribed
at
a
rate
or
rates
calculated
to
cover
as
merely
as
practicable
all
costs
of
maintaining
and
operating
the
panama
canal,
together
with
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
related
thereto,
including
interest
and
depreciation
and
an
appropriate
share
of
the
net
cost
of
operation
of
the
agency
known
as
the
canal
zone
government,
then
section
(b),
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
appropriate
share
shall
be
determined
on
a
gross
revenues
basis.
a
further
important
provision
of
section
412(b)
was
--
of
section
412
was
subsection
(d),
which
provides
--
that
--
which
incorporates
in
domestic
law
for
the
first
time
article
iii,
section
1
of
the
hay-pauncefote
treaty
providing
that
toll
shall
be
just
an
equitable,
which
i
submit
amounted
to
congress
saying
that,
that
formula
constituted
its
definition
of
what
was
just
an
equitable
under
the
treaty.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well,
at
page
169
of
the
record,
that
appears
in
comparative
print
form,
that's
going
on
from
the
report
of
the
committee
on
armed
services.
at
the
top
of
page
169
your
honors
will
find
subsection
(b)
and
then
towards
the
bottom
subsection
(d),
which
contains
the
reference
to
the
hay-pauncefote
treaty.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well,
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
is
concerned
your
honor,
i
rely
--
the
legislative
history
shows
beyond
all
possible
doubt,
and
i've
gone
into
it
at
probably
excessive
length
in
my
brief,
that
the
business
activities
which
had
always
kept
separate
accounts
and
which
should
never
have
been
included
within
the
canal
accounts
were
to
remain
separate
and
were
to
bear
their
share
of
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government,
and
of
course
if
they
were
to
bear
their
share
of
the
cost
the
canal
zone
government
and
only
an
appropriate
share
was
to
be
borne
by
tolls,
that
would
necessarily
imply
that
they
would
continue
to
be
kept
separate
from
tolls.
but
however
my
learned
friend
suggests
that
the
expression
together
with
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
related
thereto
may
refer
to
such
remotely
connected
facilities
as
the
railroad
and
the
shipping
line
and
so
on.
now,
that
suggestion
is
i
submit
not
only
answered
by
the
legislative
history,
but
it
is
also
answered
by
the
reference
to
section
10
of
the
statute
which
is
quoted
at
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
if
your
honors
will
refer
to
that.
there
is
the
expression
found
again
in
language
which
from
its
context
can
only
mean
those
facilities
--
makes
it
clear
that
the
language
can
only
mean
those
facilities
immediately
connected
with
the
canal,
such
as
the
lochs
and
the
launches,
towing
locomotives
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
president
is
hereby
authorized
to
transfer
to
the
corporation
the
panama
canal
together
with
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
related
thereto,
in
other
words
exactly
the
same
language
used
a
little
later
in
section
12(b),
heretofore
maintained
and
operated
by
the
panama
canal
under
--
excuse
me,
together
with
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
related
thereto,
and
in
other
words
a
distinction
is
made,
any
or
all
of
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
heretofore
maintained
and
operated
by
the
panama
canal
under
(inaudible)
section
1
of
title
2
of
the
canal
zone
code
as
amended
by
section
2
of
the
act
of
august
12,
1949.
now
the
act
of
august
12,
1949
shows
that
the
other
--
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
heretofore
maintained
are
the
business
operations
which
the
panama
canal,
the
unincorporated
agency
has
asked
at
that
time.
now
as
the
defendant
corporation
already
had
the
railroad,
the
shipping
line,
and
those
other
business
activities,
this
statute
which
provides
for
a
transfer
cannot
possibly
relate
to
them,
because
the
statute
authorizing
a
transfer
cannot
relate
to
things
that
the
transferee
already
has.
now
i
also
rely
on
certain
admissions
by
the
defendant.
one
of
these
is
its
1952
budget
program.
that
budget
program
was
prepared
in
the
late
summer
and
fall
of
1950
and
was
given
to
congress
by
the
president
in
january
1951.
in
other
words,
it
was
prepared
at
the
time
when
the
legislative
process
was
fresh
in
everybody's
mind.
that
budget
program
was
submitted
completely
on
our
theory
of
the
case,
that
is
to
say
it
had
presented
separate
accounts
for
the
canal
activity
and
the
other
activities
and
showed
that
tolls
were
expected
only
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
canal
activity.
the
second
admission
to
which
we
point
is
an
opinion
rendered
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
defendant
company
to
its
president,
all
we
know
about
that
is
a
reference
in
the
comptroller
general's
1954
audit
report.
and
from
that
reference
it
appears
that
in
december
1953,
the
defendant's
president
had
submitted
–
prepared
for
submission
to
its
board
of
directors
a
pricing
policy
statement,
the
gist
of
which
apparently
was
that
the
prices
of
the
business
activities
need
a
yield
only
enough
to
pay
their
direct
operating
expense,
the
implication
being
that
all
the
overhead
expense
could
be
charged
against
tolls.
now
the
defendant's
general
counsel,
then
according
to
the
general
accounting
office
report
advised
the
president
that
that
was
unlawful,
yet
according
to
the
general
accounting
office
the
president
withheld
that
opinion
from
the
board
of
directors,
withheld
the
pricing
policy
statement
from
the
board
of
directors
and
proceeded
to
go
on
and
do
exactly
what
his
own
general
counsel
had
told
him
was
unlawful.
i
might
say
that
i
clamored
in
the
district
court,
i
clamored
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
clamored
in
my
briefs
here
for
a
copy
of
this
opinion
of
the
general
counsel
but
the
defendant
has
not
seen
fit
to
give
it
to
me,
or
give
to
the
any
of
the
courts.
the
third
admission
to
which
i
point
is
a
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
excuse
me,
to
the
president
of
the
defendant.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
the
panama
canal
company.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
general
seybold
was
president
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
your
honor
in
his
capacity
as
governor
of
the
canal
zone,
he
was
the
creature
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
conformed
by
the
senate
incidentally.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
the
president
of
the
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
all
the
governors
and
presidents
have
been
army
–
up
in
the
corps
of
engineers.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
the
governor
of
the
canal
zone
is
a
presidential
appointee
confirmed
by
the
senate.
the
law
requires
that
the
governor
of
the
canal
zone
also
be
the
president
of
the
defendant,
the
stockholder
of
the
defendant
company
is
designated
by
the
president
and
he
is
designated
the
secretary
of
the
army.
the
secretary
of
the
army
designates
directors,
the
members
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
defendant
company
and
they
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
go
through
the
forms
of
electing
the
president
because
by
virtue
of
law,
the
president
of
the
defendant
must
be
the
same
man
who
is
governor
of
the
canal.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
he
is
confirmed
by
the
senate
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
it's
my
--
that's
my
understanding
certainly.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
believe
he
is
confirmed
by
the
senate.
mr.
rankin
says
that
i'm
correct
in
that.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
at
the
present
time
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
honestly
don't
know
your
honor,
but
it
is
my
understanding
for
many
years,
the
president
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
think
it
was
changed
by
the
act
of
august
24,
1912.
i
think
in
general
(inaudible)
day
it
was
the
isthmian
commission.
then
the
act
of
august
24
1912
abolished
the
isthmian
commission
and
provided
that
the
panama
canal
area
and
zone
should
be
run
by
a
governor
appointed
by
the
president
subject
to
confirmation
by
the
president.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
some
of
them
are
but
many
of
them
are
not.
they
are
selected
at
the
pleasure
of
the
secretary
of
the
army.n
ow
as
my
time
seems
to
be
running
out
somewhat
i've
tried
to
cut
some
of
this
development
of
the
facts
short.
i've
competed
my
development
of
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
requiring
the
defendant
to
prescribe
tolls
on
the
basis
of
the
canal
activity
only
in
that
regard,
the
losses
of
business
activities.
now
i
also
submit
that
that
is
required
by
the
hay-pauncefote
treaty.
in
substance,
these
other
expenses
are
expenses
of
the
armed
forces.
in
other
words
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government
is
so
much
greater
because
of
the
presence
of
the
armed
forces
and
these
business
activities
largely
serve
the
armed
forces
or
serve
them
as
well
as
their
expenses
are
a
great
(inaudible)
zone
government
are
a
great
deal
more
because
of
their
service.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
not
as
a
canal,
in
other
words
the
armed
forces
are
there
because
it's
our
caribbean
base,
it's
the
headquarters
of
the
caribbean
command.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
it
has
always
been
the
view
of
congress
and
it
apparently
is
also
the
view
of
the
british
government,
that
national
defense
is
–
costs
of
national
defense
are
not
a
proper
charge
against
canal
tolls.
that
was
the
view
taken
by
this
very
act
and
the
british
government
agrees
with
that,
as
i
read
its
brief
agrees
with
that
construction
of
the
statute.
congress
has
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
it
includes
the
school
expenses
of
the
employees
of
the
canal
and
also
the
school
expenses
of
the
members
of
the
armed
forces
and
also
the
hospital
expenses
of
the
members
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
and
that
was
allocated
on
the
basis
of
an
appropriate
chair,
appropriate
to
be
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
that's
right.
it's
a
military
community.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
that's
a
little
hard
to
say
your
honor,
i
would
say
it
was
pretty
much
under
military
administration.
it's
true
that
there
is
nothing
which
would
prevent
the
president
from
designating
a
civilian
as
governor
but
he
always
designated
a
military
man
and
we
have
a
higher
officer
as
commander-in-chief
caribbean
command
down
there
on
the
canal
zone
too,
it's
very
much
of
a
military
base.
in
fact
of
the
area
of
the
canal
zone
seven
times
as
much
as
under
the
control
of
the
armed
forces
as
is
under
the
command
--
under
the
control
of
this
defendant.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
your
honor
only
the
cost
of
the
government
of
the
canal
zone,
but
that
government
is
far
more
expenses
because
of
the
presence
of
the
armed
forces,
our
troops
are
not
--
local
police
are
paid
by
the
canal
zone
government
but
the
wages,
salaries
of
the
troops
themselves
aren't.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
your
honor
prior
to
this
act,
the
panama
canal,
the
unincorporated
agency
construed
by
the
act
of
1912
operated
both
the
canal,
the
civil
government
and
certain
business
operations
and
the
business
operations
were
operated
at
a
profit.
of
course
the
zone
government
made
no
profit,
it
was
a
government.
the
tolls,
according
to
the
statute
were
not
based
on
anything
in
particular,
it
was
simply
that
the
president
was
authorized
to
prescribe
tolls
within
certain
limits,
but
the
statute
did
not
prescribe
a
tolls-making
formula.
the
concept
of
a
formula
was
introduced
into
the
legislation
for
the
first
time
by
the
act
of
september
26,
1950.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
there
was
--
the
legislative
hearings
indicate
that
there
was
kind
of
an
understanding
between
the
governor
of
the
zone
and
the
secretary
of
war
and
the
president
by
which
tolls
would
be
fixed
so
as
to
pay
all
the
costs
of
not
only
operating
the
canal,
but
also
operating
the
canal
zone
government
and
also
paying
3%
on
all
the
investment
in
the
canal.
and
it
was
against
that
situation,
that
the
shipping
industry
protested
in
1948
when
an
increase
was
proposed
because
of
increased
governmental
and
military
costs.
at
that
time
--
the
situation
was
then
brought
to
a
head
and
we
said,
that's
not
fair,
that's
a
national
defense
cost
not
a
ship
transit
cost,
and
hence
we
should
only
pay
part
of
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government.
and
i
won't
go
through
all
the
arguments
back
and
forth
but
the
net
result
was
that
the
force
of
that
argument
was
recognized
by
congress
in
section
412(b)
which
said
that
tolls
would
be
prescribed
on
canal
operation,
interest
on
the
investment
to
be
fixed
at
the
current
rate
being
paid
by
the
government,
plus
an
appropriate
share
of
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government.
the
other
share,
as
to
how
the
other
share
is
to
be
paid
the
statute
is
silent,
but
the
bureau
of
the
budget
report
and
the
armed
services
report
assert
that
the
remaining
share
was
to
be
borne
by
the
business
activities.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
exactly
your
honor.
the
act
of
1950
gave
us
relief,
and
the
government,
the
defendant
has
denied
this
technically.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor,
may
i
add
just
a
little?
what
your
honor
says
is
correct,
but
the
president
who
was
authorized
by
congress
only
to
fix
tolls
within
certain
limits,
in
other
words
he
had
to
fix
a
particular
toll
within
a
framework
of
legislative
policy.
but
the
particular
toll
that
he
selected
within
those
limits
was
a
matter
which
the
president
did
on
the
basis
of
advice.
now
that
was
changed
by
the
act
of
september
20
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
act
of
september
26.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
oh
it
allows
them
maneuvering
room
your
honor
because
the
--
i
will
agree
with
my
learned
friend
in
this,
that
the
execution
of
the
statute
involves
discretion,
but
that
discretion
must
be
exercised
upon
a
correct
construction
of
the
statute.
we
don't
deny
that
the
statute,
that
the
--
i
mean
the
languages
of
the
section
12(b)
which
i
read
your
honors
a
little
while
ago
clearly
involves
discretionary
determinations,
and
we
say
that
the
approval
power
of
the
president
is
to
review
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
within
the
legislative
policy
laid
down
by
section
412(b).
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
not
entirely.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
not
entirely
right
your
honor,
it's
certainly
true
that
they
--
and
in
fact
we
have
submitted,
as
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
annex
some
of
their
budget
programs
as
they
have
actually
submitted
them
to
congress,
i
think
appendix
f
is
--
i
believe
was
taken
on
the
precise
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
they
do
not
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
in
its
annual
report,
to
its
stockholder
it
reports
what
the
tolls
have
been.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
i
assume
that
it
does.
i
don't
--
i
imagine
that
the
members
of
the
congress
get
it,
but
it's
actually
rendered
to
a
stockholder,
not
to
congress.
but
the
budget
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
i
--
your
honor
i
would
assume
that
it's
a
matter
of
practice,
if
not
it's
a
matter
of
law,
the
report
does
go
to
members
of
congress,
but
i
don't
--
the
report
if
you
read
it
says
it
goes
to
the
stockholder.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
secretary
of
the
army.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
munited
states
government
owns
the
stock,
but
the
secretary
of
the
army
is
the
stockholder.
your
honor
with
respect
to
this
submission
to
congress,
let
me
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
[attempt
to
laughter]
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
your
honor
let
me
--
i
think
the
importance,
the
deductions
to
be
drawn
from
these
submissions
to
congress
can
best
be
determined
by
considering
--
by
reference
to
the
statute
under
which
they
are
submitted,
which
is
the
government
corporation
control
act,
i
discuss
that
at
page
99
of
my
brief
your
honor.
these
budget
programs
are
submitted
to
congress
under
section
849
of
title
31
of
the
code
and
are
for
the
purpose
of
congress's
action
in
making
available
for
expenditure,
such
monies
as
congress
sees
fit.
now
the
language
of
congress
every
year
in
authorizing
expenditure,
and
i
might
say
that
because
no
appropriations
are
involved,
the
minutes
of
the
appropriations
committee
considering
these
budget
programs
indicate
that
they
are
not
considered
very
exhaustibly
and
here
is
a
company
that
comes
in
that
isn't
asking
for
an
appropriate
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
your
honor,
certainly
not
for
the
years
in
question
here.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
because
our
earnings
had
been
so
great,
that
even
if
the
statutory
rate
had
been
in
effect,
no
appropriations
would
have
been
necessary,
and
in
fact
a
large
--
sums
in
interest
would
have
been
paid,
we
worked
that
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
it
would
make
some
difference,
it
certainly
would
make
a
difference,
it'd
make
a
lot
of
difference
to
us
but
also
in
the
amount
of
interest
which
was
paid,
they
would
not
pay
full
interest,
but
your
honor
said
appropriations
would
be
required.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
if
the
statutory
rate
had
been
in
effect,
the
defendant
would
not
have
been
able
to
pay
$15
million
in
dividends.
they
would
not
--
the
treasurer
would
undoubtedly
have
been
affected,
the
defendant
could
not
have
paid
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes
your
honor.
all
--
my
only
point
is
that
appropriations
would
not
have
been
necessary.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
that
is
true
but
not
to
the
extent
that
reg
appropriations
would
have
been
required.
now,
your
honor
congress
in
acting
on
these
budget
programs
has
not
given
its
blessing
to
the
toll
rate
which
does
not
appear
in
budget
programs.
all
that
appears
in
the
budget
programs
is
estimated
income
and
the
actual
language
of
each
act
has
been
this,
“the
following
corporation,”
referring
to
defendants,
“is
hereby
authorized
to
make
such
expenditures.”
in
other
words
all
that
congress
does
is
to
authorize
the
expenditures
set
forth
in
the
budget
program
“within
the
limits
of
funds
and
borrowing
authority
available
to
it
and
in
accord
with
law.”
now
i
submit
that
what
congress
is
doing
and
that's
quite
consistent
with
the
government
corporation
control
act
is
saying
to
the
extent
that
you
can
get
your
money
lawfully,
you
may
spend
it
as
you
propose.
i
don't
see
that
any
additional
meaning
can
be
given
to
these
various
actions
by
congress.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well,
congress
is
quite
familiar
with
this
suit.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
oh
yes
because
the
comptroller
although
the
company
reports
under
the
statute
do
not
go
congress
as
i
read
them,
although
undoubtedly
get
there,
the
comptroller
general's
reports
are
made
to
congress.
however
as
soon
as
the
comptroller
general
came
out
with
his
analysis
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
may
1955,
and
we
brought
our
suit.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes,
but
we
immediately
brought
our
suit.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well,
it
had
notice
of
the
charges
but
it
didn't
have
notice
of
our
claim
of
illegality.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
not
until
may
1955,
i
would
say,
at
any
rate
at
the
court
of
appeals
--
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
defendant
by
ambiguous
bookkeeping
concealed
what
as
going
on
until
the
comptroller
general
came
out
with
his
report
in
may
1955.
then
in
september
1955
we
brought
this
suit
to
compel
the
enforcement
of
the
law
as
we
construe
it,
as
the
comptroller
general
construes
it,
as
the
british
government
construes
it
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
the
concealment
is
this
your
honor,
in
that
it
does
not
--
in
that
the
defendant
unlike
its
earlier
practice,
unlike
the
practice
of
other
government
corporations,
at
no
time
gave
a
breakdown
of
results
by
activity
after
the
allocation
of
corporate
overhead.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no,
i
don't
suggest,
all
i
say
is
that
unlike
their
own
former
budge
programs,
unlike
their
own
formal
reports,
unlike
the
reports
of
other
government
corporations,
unlike
the
budget
programs
of
--
budget
programs
of
other
corporations,
this
corporation
has
not
shown
the
net
result
by
activity
after
allocation
of
corporate
overhead.
that
sums
up
and
we're
--
and
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
certainly
subject
to
all
the
provisions
of
the
government
corporation
control
act.
i
think
it
is
a
special
act
that
deals
with
government
corporations
and
it
is
all
--
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
subject
to
all
the
provisions
applicable
to
all
government
agencies,
but
it's
certainly
applicable
to
all
--
subject
to
all
the
provisions
of
the
government
corporation
control
act.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
i
would
like
to
make
--
i
have
very
little
time
left
and
i
would
like
to
direct
my
attention
to
the
meaning
in
this
--
skipping
all
other
things
i
intend
to
say,
to
the
meaning
of
the
president's
review
powers
provided
in
section
411.
now
we
say
that
the
duty
of
the
president
under
the
section
411
proviso
was
to
enforce
the
law
and
to
review
the
defendant's
exercise
of
discretion,
but
not
to
act
according
to
his
whim
or
fancy.
we
say
that's
because
of
the
legislative
history
which
shows
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
grant
us
relief
here
to
establish
a
tolls
policy,
a
policy
which
was
very
carefully
considered,
very
carefully
worked
out.
the
references
to
the
president's
review
power
are
practically
negligible
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out.
again
the
statutory
precedents
tolls
policy
has
always
been
a
matter
of
congressional
policy
although
the
president
has
had
a
limited
discretion
within
the
framework
of
that
policy
and
when
president
wilson,
when
president
franklin
roosevelt
wanted
changes
in
that
policy,
they
went
to
congress
for
that
purpose.
we
also
say
the
language
and
the
arrangement
of
the
statute,
section
412
deals
with
policy,
basis
of
tolls,
section
411
deals
with
authority
and
procedure.
if
the
president
was
to
have
policy
making
powers
inconsistent
with
the
policy
laid
down
by
congress
that
would
be
have
been
in
section
412.
we
also
say
because
of
the
legal
meaning
which
has
been
given
this
court
and
other
courts
to
the
expression
subject
to
the
approval
of,
that
has
been
repeatedly
held
to
mean
that
the
approving
authority
determines
the
lawfulness
of
the
action
of
a
subordinate.
whether
the
subordinate
has
acted
within
the
law
and
this
court
has
held
most
emphatically
that
it
does
--
that
subject
to
the
approval
of,
does
not
give
the
approving
authority,
the
privilege
of
substituting
his
own
judgment
for
the
will
of
congress.
and
in
daniels
against
wagner
this
court
most
sarcastically
described
the
very
argument
which
is
advanced
by
defendant
here.
we
also
say
that
it
is
true
under
the
law
of
rate
making,
under
which
the
legislative
--
rate
making
as
a
legislative
function,
the
legislature
lays
down
a
policy
and
leaves
it
to
the
executive
branch
or
an
independent
agent
to
execute
that
policy.
we
say
it's
also
shown
by
the
anomalous
character
of
the
non-statutory
factors
which
this
defendant
proposes
or
the
defendant
consider.
he
proposes
that
for
instance,
the
defendant
proposes
that
the
--
if
the
president
may
consider
the
welfare
of
the
railroads,
whether
or
not
it
will
take
business
away
from
the
railroads.
now
i
submit
your
honor
that
it's
anomalous
and
violative
of
our
net
good
faith
in
the
hay-pauncefote
treaty,
that
the
shipping
of
the
world,
and
70%
of
shipping
is
foreign
shipping,
should
have
to
pay
a
surcharge
for
the
purposes
of
bolstering
up
a
competing
american
facility,
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
10%
of
the
traffic
is
intercoastal
water
traffic
and
that
has
been
going
down
as
compared
with
pre-war.
if
there's
anybody
that
needs
relief
it's
the
intercoastal
water
carriers
and
not
the
railroads.
the
defendant
also
suggests
that
the
purpose
is
to
consider
the
welfare
of
suez
that
he
must
--
this
traffic
is
to
be
--
this
rate
is
too
adjusted
according
to
the
needs
of
our
foreign
policy.
now
i
submit
that,
that
is
highly
improper,
i
mean
do
we
say
that
the
united
arab
republic
may
adjust
the
tolls
rate
at
suez
according
to
the
needs
of
its
foreign
policy,
i
submit
that,
that
--
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
and
furthermore
our
construction
fits
in
entirely
with
the
constitution
which
says
that
the
function
of
the
president
--
that
the
--
a
function
of
the
president
is
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
and
we
say
that
the
purpose
here
was
that
he
take
care
that
the
defendant
faithfully
executed
section
412.
now
even
if
are
wrong
in
that
however,
we
say
the
president's
views
of
the
law
are
not
reviewable
by
the
courts,
still
we
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
compel
that
this
defendant
to
make
a
correct
application
of
the
statute
under
cases
such
as
virginia
railway
against
federation
and
united
states
against
wilbur
which
say
that
a
corporation
and
an
agency
maybe
compelled
to
exercise
their
discretion
according
to
the
law.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
this
was
what
happened
your
honor.
a
bill
was
introduced
into
the
congress
which
was
sitting
in
1955
and
1956
to
provide
that
the
review
of
this
defendant's
tolls
prescription
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
question
arose
whether
or
not
this
was
an
appropriate
kind
of
function
for
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
chandler
wrote
a
letter
that
it
was.
i
think
his
letter
said
that
judge
clark
thought
that
it
was.
i
don't
think
that's
in
our
brief,
i
think
that's
in
their
brief,
i
don't
recall
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
not
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
i
don't
think
--
my
understanding
of
the
situation
is
this
that
this
bill,
putting
review
power
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
chandler
communicated
with
judge
clark
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
he
did
not,
but
i
communicated
with
mr.
chandler.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
chief
judge
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
[laughter]
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
this
bill
put
the
review
power
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
this,
instead
of
having
review
in
the
district
court,
this
put
the
review
power
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
the
bill
was
in
1955,
i
think.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no
before
this
litigation.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
no,
well
i
don't
recall,
i
think
it
went
in
march
--
i
don't
recall
just
when
it
went
in
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
the
only
question
was
whether
or
not
the
review
power
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
mr.
chandler
wrote
a
letter
to
senator
magnuson,
i
don't
recall
the
incident
very
well,
the
gist
of
it
was
however
that
senator
magnuson
i
believe
wrote
to
mr.
chandler
and
mr.
chandler
then
wrote
a
letter
to
senator
magnuson
and
then
--
saying
it
wasn't
appropriate
for
judicial
review
and
then
he
wrote
a
letter
saying
that
it
was
appropriate
for
judicial
review,
i
believe
that
was
the
gist
of
it.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
yes.
may
i
make
just
a
couple
of
remarks
your
honor?
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
my
learned
friend
referred
to
judge
walsh's
remark
saying
he
was
only
going
to
consider
jurisdiction.
his
opinion
i
submit
shows
that
he
went
way
beyond
jurisdictional
matters
and
that
exercise
--
he
exercised
jurisdiction
and
didn't
merely
decide
whether
or
not
he
had
jurisdiction.
in
fact
in
the
court
of
appeals
i
complained
bitterly
about
judge
walsh
after
telling
me
that
he
was
only
going
to
consider
jurisdiction,
going
way
beyond
consideration.
i
don't
think
there's
--
one
can
possible
reconcile
judge
walsh's
opinions,
but
those
remarks
which
he
made,
which
mr.
rankin
read
a
few
minutes
ago.
and
on
this
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
the
answer
that
he
took
which
--
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
he
dismissed
the
complaint.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
he
went
beyond
jurisdiction
is
because
you
construed
the
statute
as
meaning
that
tolls
fixing
was
a
matter
of
the
defendant's
contentment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
largely
devoted
to
that
thesis
of
judge
walsh.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
well
your
honor
–-
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
your
honor
all
i
can
say
is
that,
if
i
understand
jurisdiction
correctly
and
that
was
my
--
what
i
argued
with
the
court
of
appeals
at
any
rate,
that
he
went
beyond
jurisdiction.
now
i
make
one
request
your
honor
with
great
reluctance
because
i'm
afraid
we've
burdened
the
court
enormously
here
already,
but
mr.
rankin
late
tuesday
served
a
reply
brief
on
me,
in
which
i
think
he
has
been
mislead
by
what
i
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
regarded
as
defendant's
ambiguous
bookkeeping
and
makes
a
certain
statement
that
i
do
not
think
is
supported
by
the
facts.
i
think
my
--
and
i
don't
blame
him
for
it
but
i
think
he
has
been
mislead
by
that
bookkeeping
and
i
wondered
if
i
could
put
in
a
few,
say
something
not
more
than
five
pages.
mr.
charles
dickerman
williams
thank
you.
