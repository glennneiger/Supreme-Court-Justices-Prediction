mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
williams,
before
you
get
to
that,
i
wonder
if
it
would
disturb
you
too
much
to
answer
the
inquiry
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
of
the
solicitor
general
just
a
moment
ago,
would
that
disturb
your
argument
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
just,
is
your
position
contrary
to
his
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder,
i
wonder
before
you
do
that
if
i
get
a
little
more
precise
answer,
i
am
not
clear
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
am
not
clear
yet
as
to
whether
you
can
claim
that
there
is
any
judicial
review
of
the
action
of
the
president
or
whether
the
action
of
the
president
in
this
regard
is
conclusive.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may
do
it
now
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
history
showing
just
what
is
meant
by
the
words
together
with
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
related
thereto?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
new
method
of
bookkeeping
mr.
williams
to
charge
those
things
against
the
tolls
or
is
that,
that
had
been
done
over
a
long
period
of
years?
i
presume
there's
always
some
military
and
some
defense
down
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
take
it
then
it
was
not
based
upon
any
budgeting
at
all
prior
to
1950?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
i
take
it
that
this
is
in
your
view,
this
is
an
old
practice
that
was
remedied
by
the
act
of
1950
and
that
the
government
has
not
conformed
to
the
1950
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
williams
may
i
ask
you
a
question
concerning
which
i'm
rather
curious?
i
noticed
in
your
brief,
you
mention
that
mr.
henry
chandler
the
director
of
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
wrote
an
opinion
on
this
subject
on
which
you
relied
and
which
was
put
in
the
report
on
the
bill,
what
brought
him
into
this
situation?
it
strikes
me
as
a
little
curious,
because
i
little
[laughter]
(inaudible)
i
would
think
from
his
duties.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
i
beg
your
pardon.
[attempt
to
laughter]
it's
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
am
sorry
i
asked
you
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
put
the
burden
on
you,
i
thought
it
was
your
brief,
would
you
tell
me
then
i'd
just
like
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
it
something
that
was
done
at
the
direction
of
the
judicial
conference,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
done
at
the
direction
of
judicial
conference,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
