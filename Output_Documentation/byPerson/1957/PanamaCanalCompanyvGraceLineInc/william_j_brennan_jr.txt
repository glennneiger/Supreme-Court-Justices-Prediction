activities
that

give
me
a
lot
of
details
that
--
what
are
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
include
industries
of
any
kind
or
commercial
activities
does,
other
than
commissaries
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
department
stores
in
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now,
the
canal
zone
is
rather
narrow
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
this
is
--
only
those
things
of
course
done
within
the
boundary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
include
everything
that's
done
in
the
way
of
the
commercial
activities
on
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
within
the
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
did
that
include
mr.
solicitor?
i
mean,
schools
or
things
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
total
cost
or
the
school
cost?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
corporate
directors
army
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
corporate
directors
also
army
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
you
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
said
to
us
earlier
that
there's
been
some
understanding
that
you
would
have
an
opportunity
to
meet
the
evidence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
--
let's
see
if
i
get
this
clearly.
what
you
asked
in
the
brief
is
that
we
reinstate
judge
walsh's
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
ask
that
on
the
ground
that
even
taking
the
respondent's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
which
imports
some
discretion
in
the
company,
that
on
this
record
it
appears
that
what
the
statute
required
to
be
done,
the
company
in
fact
has
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
on
that
basis
that
you
say
that
the
original
judgment
of
dismissal
should
be
reinstated.
now
are
you
also
saying
alternatively
in
any
event,
on
that
construction
of
the
statute,
if
we're
not
satisfied,
that
the
record
shows
that
you
can
(inaudible)
that
you're
entitled
to
be
heard
in
the
district
court,
in
opposition
it
will
be
affidavits
or
whatever
it
is
the
respondent
offers.
