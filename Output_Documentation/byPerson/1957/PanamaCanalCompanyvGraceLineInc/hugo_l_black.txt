justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
charge
that
the
--
the
rates
are
unauthorized
by
the
statute,
congress
cited?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
--
i
--
i
was
asking
you
because
i
don't
quite
yet
understand
how
the
treaty
proposition
could
get
into
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
is
it
plain
that
congress
does
not
have
a
right
to
pass
this
law
because
it's
forbidden
to
do
so
by
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
--
that
would
--
that
could
bring
it
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us
to
say
--
the
holding
that
there
are
no
circumstances
of
any
kind
under
which
judicial
reviews
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us
to
say
here
that
it
was
wrong
to
render
summary
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
we
know
judicially
or
otherwise
that
they
have
a
(inaudible)
and
assume
furthermore,
assume
also
that
they
charge
those
who
made
flagrant
violation
of
the
act
which
gave
them
power
to
proceed,
is
it
your
position
that
a
court
would
have
no
power
to
take
any
action
at
all
in
that
connection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
they
have
alleged
have
they
not
that
the
action
taken
is
unlawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
i
meant
was,
is
there
something
about
--
if
they
allege
that
the
act
is
required
to
do
certain
things
and
they
also
allege
that
none
of
them
had
been
done
that
the
act
requires,
is
it
still
your
position
that
the
court
would
no
jurisdiction
to
proceed,
and
if
so
what
is
the
ground
for
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
–
suppose
(inaudible)
you
had
acted
on
the
basis
of
the
cost
of
certain
collateral,
so
called
collateral
activity
(inaudible),
and
if
that
was
precisely
prohibited
by
the
act,
and
that
the
result
of
what
you
did
rested
on
that
basis,
would
you
say
still
the
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
on
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
are
not
claiming
that
there
are
no
prejudices
under
which
they
could
get
judicial
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
communicate
with
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
rate
fixed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
rate
fixed?
