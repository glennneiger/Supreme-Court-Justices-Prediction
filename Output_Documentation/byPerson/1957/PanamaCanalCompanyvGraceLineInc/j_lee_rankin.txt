mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
involves
the
question
of
the
fixing
of
tolls
on
the
panama
canal,
a
property
of
the
united
states.
the
broad
issue
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
ultimate
control
on
the
fixing
of
the
tolls
for
the
canal
shall
be
with
the
petitioner
and
finally
the
president,
as
provided
by
the
statute,
or
if
the
comptroller
general
as
in
this
case
developed
should
find
that
certain
procedures
of
accounting
that
are
followed
by
the
petitioner
are
not
satisfactory
to
him
and
persons
who
are
financially
interested
can
appeal
to
the
courts
to
compel
the
petitioner
to
adopt
those
accounting
practices
in
arriving
at
the
tolls.
over
considerable
period
of
years,
in
fact
from
the
time
the
canal
was
constructed
up
to
1950,
the
statute
provided
that
the
president
was
authorized
to
prescribe
tolls
from
time
to
time
for
the
canal.
this
action
was
considered
final.
there
was
no
procedure
for
judicial
review
and
no
one
claimed
that
there
was.
under
this
procedure
up
until
1950,
the
president
set
the
tolls
at
various
times.
president
taft,
president
roosevelt
and
the
last
instant
was
a
attempt
on
the
part
of
president
truman
to
increase
the
tolls
from
90
cents,
but
they
were
fixed
by
president
roosevelt
in
1937
to
a
dollar
in
1948.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
he
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
usually
followed
the
advice
of
the
people
working
with
the
canal
and
its
operations
and
the
panama
canal
railroad
company
and
the
--
the
army
people
who
were
operating
the
canal
in
regard
to
that.
and
when
he
proposed
to
increase
this
additional
10
cents,
there
was
a
considerable
protest
on
part
of
the
shipping
in
--
industry.
and
the
--
the
statute
provided
the
issue
to
give
six
months
notice
of
any
such
proposed
increase.
so
the
congress
responded
to
that
protest
by
the
industry
and
suggested
that
the
president
--
excuse
me
--
review
the
question
in
the
procedures
and
the
operations
of
the
canal
and
come
forth
with
recommendations
as
to
any
changes
that
he
might
desire
or
think
proper,
so
for
a
period
of
about
three
years,
the
congress
considered
whether
there's
number
of
hearings
in
which
the
railroads
participated
and
the
ship
--
ship
owners
and
the
--
the
army
and
the
bureau
of
the
budget.
the
bureau
of
the
budget
recommended
that
all
of
the
activities
of
the
canal
be
consolidated
in
one
corporation
that
the
corporation
being
the
panama
railroad
company
with
the
name
be
changed
to
panama
canal
company
and
have
the
--
both
the
supporting
business
activities
as
well
as
the
canal
operations
themselves
all
handled
by
this
one
corporation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
operate
hotels,
steamship
lines,
a
railroad,
commissaries,
dry
docks,
terminals,
all
the
different
things
that
this
court
held
in
ex
rel.
rogers
versus
graves
were
apart
of
the
operation
of
the
canal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
a
considerable
part
of
those,
the
commissaries
and
the
utilities
and
other
things
would
be
considered
ordinary
commercial
activities,
but
they're
necessary
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
isn't
quite
department
stores
but
they
are
large
commissaries
and
the
gross
income
runs
around
$27
million,
$28
million
a
year
in
some
years.
and
it's
a
very
substantial
operation
running
into
many
millions
of
dollars
in
these
business
activities,
but
they
all
support.
it's
the
contention
of
the
government,
the
operation
of
this
canal.
and
they
wouldn't
be
provided
by
--
by
the
government
at
all
if
it
wasn't
necessary
and
has
been
proven
so
over
the
years.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
for
the
service
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
understand
there
are
competing
activities
that
are
civilian
or
the
panamanians
in
the
area,
but
that
--
these
are
provided
by
the
belief
of
the
governmental
authorities
that
they're
necessary
to
carry
on
the
operation
of
the
canal
and
they
have
been
ever
since
1914
when
the
canal
was
open.
so
that
this
new
statute
was
developed
where
the
recommendation
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget
that
the
president
should
have
greater
assistance
in
trying
to
arrive
what
was
a
sound
and
fair
rate
or
toll
for
the
canal.
they
had
to
have
more
expert
advice
and
it
was
provided
that
the
petitioner
should
have
in
exactly
the
same
language
as
the
president
formally
have,
the
authority
to
provide
tolls
from
time
to
time.
it's
also
expressly
provided
that
those
--
whatever
the
petitioner
determined
would
be
subject
to
review
by
the
president
and
that
his
action
would
be
final
and
conclusive.
and
many
statutes
that
provide
with
president's
action
or
someone
acting
in
administrative
capacity
should
be
final,
but
this
was
final
and
conclusive.
it
also
provided
that
the
tolls,
being
in
effect,
should
continue
until
such
time,
as
the
petitioner
and
the
president
determined
that
there
should
be
a
change.
there
was
a
--
a
considerable
claim
by
the
shipping
industry
that
the
--
there
were
large
defense
activities
involved
in
the
whole
conduct
of
the
canal
and
its
operations.
and
therefore,
that
--
that
should
be
taken
into
account
by
the
congress
in
trying
to
arrive
with
the
tolls.
so
in
connection
with
this
new
formula
that
was
developed
at
that
time,
the
congress
provided
certain
provisions
that
therefore
had
been
included
in
the
tolls
should
be
excluded
to
take
care
of
this
claim
about
defense
activities
and
other
things.
one
of
them
was
the
conduct
of
government
vessels
in
transit
through
the
canal
and
up
to
that
time,
those
vessels
were
--
which
had
ran
into
very
seizable
amounts
during
the
war
and
during
the
korean
incident
and
other
periods
and
during
a
period
approximately
three
years
from
1951
to
1954
ran
to
$13
million.
those
tolls
at
the
discretion
of
the
president
should
be
either
charged
or
they
should
be
treated
as
though
they
were
charged
and
the
ship
owners
who
are
commercial
vessels
accredited
on
the
formula
as
though
the
government
was
paid.
it
was
also
a
reduction
in
the
interest
rate
from
3%,
the
rate
that
was
charged
up
to
that
time,
to
2
and
3
tenth
percent
or
the
going
rate
was
the
provision
and
there
was
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
the
investment
of
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
all
of
it
--
all
these
various
activities
and
there
was
also
a
credit
in
regard
to
the
interest
on
the
period
of
construction
that
up
to
that
time
in
computing
what
the
government
had
invested
in
the
canal,
they
took
the
interest
on
the
period
of
construction
which
was
a
considerable
period
of
time
that
was
engrossed
in
that
construction
period.
and
that
had
always
been
computed
as
a
part
of
the
investment
of
the
governor.
now,
they
gave
him
a
credit
and
took
out
in
that
computation
what
the
government
had
invested
in
this
property.
the
entire
amount
of
the
interest
that
would
be
upon
that
investment
during
that
construction
period,
give
them
a
benefit
of
that
and
that
end
into
a
--
over
million
dollars.
it
also
was
contemplated
that
there
would
be
a
charge
to
the
business
activities,
business
operation.
the
--
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
the
conduct
of
the
canal
zone
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
the
government
generally,
schools
were
a
considerable
portion
of
it.
and
it
ran
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
at
$7
million.
it's
over
that
now.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
total
cost.
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
all
through
the
hearings,
the
evidence
do
show
that
the
business
operations.
averaged
not
more
than
a
million
dollars
of
profit
at
anytime.
sometimes
it
rate
--
range
up
and
down,
but
it
average
a
million
dollars
and
yet
if
it
was
going
to
be
charged
with
half
of
the
cost
of
the
operation
of
the
canal
zone
government,
it
would
have
to
produce
three
and
a
half
million
and
no
one
seemed
to
figure
out
how
that
would
get
there,
how
they
would
get
that
much
profits
to
apply
to
this
purpose.
and
that
is
apparently
one
of
our
problems
in
this
situation.
qafter
the
--
the
act
also
provided
for
this
property,
all
of
it,
to
be
transferred
over
to
this
new
--
this
corporation,
men
in
existence,
but
whose
name
was
to
be
changed
and
was
to
have
complete
control
on
operation
of
these
properties.
then
the
comptroller
general
under
the
corporation
control
act
proceeded
to
audit
the
corporation
and
it
came
out
in
1954
with
an
audit
report
which
it
made
the
congress,
in
which
it
criticized
the
methods
of
the
petitioner
in
allocating
its
various
costs.
it
criticized
its
methods
in
not
--
of
taking
this
half
over
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government
and
charging
it
to
the
various
business
activities
and
also,
its
distribution
of
the
general
overhead.
and
it
said,
if
that
--
if
there
were
hearings
at
that
time,
the
canal
rates
or
the
toll
rates
would
have
to
be
materially
reduced,
in
fact
some
26%.
now,
the
effect
of
redistributing
those
costs
was
to
throw
the
business
activities
in
a
serious
deficit
all
the
way
through
because
they
just
didn't
make
that
much
money.
but
the
comptroller
general
recommended
the
congress
regardless,
of
the
fact
that
this
is
the
way
the
tolls
should
be
computed
in
accordance
with
this
formula
in
the
statute,
that
congress
should
immediately
change
the
statute
because
it
wasn't
fair
and
the
statute
should
provide
for
the
whole
cost
of
the
canal
to
be
paid
by
the
--
by
the
vessels
that
transited
the
canal.
and
that
was
the
recommendation
of
the
comptroller
general.
now,
all
through
the
hearings,
there
were
two
things
that
were
very
plain.
congress
wanted
to
make
very
certain,
that
the
american
taxpayer
didn't
have
to
pay
one
cent
toward
the
operation
of
the
canal.
and
it
was
also
contemplated
that
there
would
be
an
increase
in
the
toll
rates
and
that
--
that
increase
would
probably
run
some
5
cents
per
ton
of
90
cents
to
95
cents
of
the
increase
would
be
and
it
would
run
increase
the
revenue
from
tolls
to
$1,400,000
a
year.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
true.
there
was
a
--
the
court
may
be
interested
--
there
was
a
considerable
controversy
in
1912
and
the
statute
provided
that
coast
wise
vessels
should
be
--
should
have
transfer
to
the
canal
without
charge.
and
it
was
--
great
britain
objected
to
that
and
it
was
brought
by
president
roosevelt
and
president
wilson
to
the
congress
and
he
said,
“regardless
of
whether
we
were
right
or
wrong,
that
we
should
honor
their
claim
and
eliminate
that
provision
and
pay
for
our
coast
wise
transit.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
at
that
time,
a
little
later
that
was
eliminated,
to
finish
that
subject
and
congress
took
it
out
after
a
considerable
debate
during
which
time
they
claim
that
they
had
a
right
to
have
that
provision
anyway,
but
they
took
it
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
just
and
equitable
under
the
hay-pauncefote?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
--
there
is
no
question
of
discrimination.
there
is
a
question,
was
just
and
equitable
under
that
treaty.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i
have
been
advised
by
the
state
department
that
great
britain
has
never
raised
a
question
about
the
rates,
the
total
rates
in
panama
canal
since
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
a
brief
before
this
court.
we
think
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
great
britain's
position
and
before
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
have
understood
from
the
state
department,
that
there
was
no
representation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
know
of
no
toll
fee
passage
at
this
time
except
for
the
steamships
operated
by
the
canal
itself.
that
goes
maybe,
but
otherwise,
the
government
vessels
are
not
paying
tolls,
but
the
charges
are
setup
as
though
the
government
paid
them
so
that
it
has
the
same
effect
as
though
they
got
the
credit.
now
it
was
in
1915,
the
question
did
come
up
as
to
whether
or
not
our
government
had
right
--
right
to
transit
its
war
vessels
and
government-owned
vessels
through
the
canal
without
having
to
pay
any
tolls
at
all
under
the
hay-pauncefote
treaty
and
we
set
out
in
our
reply
brief
at
length,
an
opinion
of
attorney
general
gregory
to
the
president
at
that
time,
in
which
he
said
that
we
have
that
right
under
the
treaty,
that
is
was
in
conformity
with
the
british
standards
as
to
what
we
were
entitled
to
charge,
which
was
first,
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination
under
this
treaty.
and
secondly,
that
we
were
entitled
to
recover
full
interest
on
the
investment
and
we
were
also
entitled
to
recover
every
cost
in
connection
with
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
it.
that
was
the
communications
that
are
set
out
in
connection
with
that
opinion
or
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
think
you
are
because
of
this.
we
think
it's
very
simple
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
seen
fit
in
the
statute
to
give
them
better
than
just
and
equitable
rates.
that
the
various
points
that
i
pointed
out
running
into
millions
of
dollars
result
in
a
reduction
of
the
rates
that
were
recognized
as
just
and
equitable
for
some
30
some
years
without
protest
between
the
countries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
definitely.
we
don't
think
that
(voice
overlap).
it's
a
proper
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
we
should
and
we
would.
if
it
was
an
issue
in
this
case
properly,
we
would
certainly
want
to
bring
the
interpretation
before
you.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
they
do,
whether
or
not
it's
just
and
equitable.we
think
it
is
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
--
you
do
not
if
you
confine
that
this,
the
formula
is
substantial
below
just
and
equitable
anyway
according
to
the
communication
between
the
party,
the
representations.
you
see,
we're
not
getting
the
full
interest
that
the
british
said
we
were
entitled
to
under
their
communication
that
set
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
except
its
better.
so
that
there
is
no
basis
for
relying
on
the
treaty
because
what
they
don't
--
what
they
want
is
not
what
is
just
and
equitable
or
what
is
reasonable,
which
is
the
--
the
standard
for
private
utility,
just
and
reasonable.
but
what
they
want
is
what
the
statute
provides,
which
is
better
than
any
of
that.
and
if
you
come
to
that
point
and
i
think
that
is
true,
then
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the
construction
of
the
treaty
as
such
is
what
i
think.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
they
--
they
say
that
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
it
has
determined
that
the
--
that
the
present
rate
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
and
then
at
the
statute,
is
the
proper
rate
and
should
not
be
changed.
they
contend
that
it
was
the
obligation
of
the
petitioner
to
proceed
to
change
the
rate
and
proceed
to
reduce
it
and
take
into
account
this
overhead
charges
at
the
comptroller
general
referred
to
in
his
report.
and
the
expense
of
the
canal
zone
government
and
that
those
charges
in
connection
with
the
business
operations
would
amount
to
--
would
do
--
if
applied,
would
reduce
the
rate
some
26%,
about
24
cents
thereabout
below
the
90
cents
rather
than
having
the
90
cents.
so
we
then
get
into
the
--
the
great
problem
in
this
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
they
--
they
relied
greatly
on
that
--
on
the
law,
but
they
say
they
have
standing
because
the
congress
incorporated
in
one
of
the
sections,
the
statement
that
the
tolls
would
be
comp
--
compiled
or
fixed
in
accordance
with
the
treaty.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
if
you
found
that
under
the
factual
situation,
it
became
operative
but
if
the
rates
are
lower
than
the
treaty
could
ever
require,
then
it
doesn't
come
in
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
a
--
a
part
of
it,
certainly.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
statutes
are
set
out,
the
crucial
ones
on
page
167,
168
of
the
government's
brief
and
section
411
of
the
amendment.
i'd
like
to
call
the
--
to
your
attention
the
language
that
is
in
controversy.
since
the
panama
canal
company
is
authorized
to
prescribe
and
from
time
to
time
change
the
rules
for
the
measurement
of
vessels
for
the
canal
--
panama
canal.
and
subject
for
the
provisions
of
section
next
following
the
tolls
that
should
be
levied
towards
the
use
of
the
panama
canal.
that
is
--
the
--
it's
the
construction
of
that
section
that
is
crucial
between
the
parties
as
well
as
the
application
of
412
(b)
in
that.
it's
the
position
of
the
respondent's
that
the
petitioner
had
no
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
change
the
tolls
that
it
was
directed
by
the
statute
to
proceed
at
once
or
at
least
promptly
with
determining
new
tolls
and
then
applying
the
formula
under
412
(b).
this
is
exactly
the
same
language
as
far
as
the
authorization
is
concerned
that
was
formally
in
the
statute
for
the
president
to
fix
the
tolls.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
pre
--
president's
relations
and
provided
further
on
the
--
further
down.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
167
that
changes
in
basic
rules
of
measurement
and
changes
in
rates
of
tolls
shall
be
subject
to
and
shall
take
effect
upon
the
approval
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
whose
action
in
such
matter
shall
be
final
and
conclusive.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
this
is
an
authorization
provision
in
expressed
terms
that
it
gives
the
authority.
it
doesn't
say
that
they
have
to,
it
isn't
compulsive
as
far
as
the
petitioner
is
concerned
to
change
the
rates
but
it
does
provide
that
they
may.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
has
a
complete
control
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he's
the
sole
stockholder.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
points
--
that's
right.
and
he
can
--
he's
entirely
responsive
to
his
will.
its
budget
is
passed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
budget
is
passed
upon
by
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
submitted
to
the
congress,
the
congress
passes
on
it
and
determined
whether
the
appropriations
are
properly
--
proper
and
appropriates
the
money
because
the
--
a
good
portion
of
money
is
covered
into
the
treasury.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
they're
presidential
entirely.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
rely
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
relies
on
the
bureau
of
the
budget
in
--
in
regard
to
the
function
which
the
government
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
which
is
a
part
of
the
office
of
the
president
on
our
governmental
structure
and
it
reviews
this
budget
and
it
makes
recommendations
and
so
forth
and
--
and
then
only
then
is,
it
sent
to
the
congress
as
far
as
the
proposed
appropriations
and
it
makes
up
the
--
apart
of
the
presidential
budget
that
he
has
to
account
for
and
the
total
appropriations
that
have
to
be
taken
care
of
by
the
congress
either
approving
or
reducing
or
enlarging
upon.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
not
been
any
change
in
the
tolls,
but
there
have
been
budgets
that
have
been
filed
and
there
have
been
appropriations
by
the
congress
on
the
very
--
after
the
petitioner
told
the
congress,
that
it
thought
the
rate
should
be
the
same,
that
it
did
examined
the
question,
determined
it,
that
the
rate
should
not
be
changed
and
that
it's
--
the
budget
should
be
a
certain
amount
based
upon
that
assumption,
then
the
congress
have
examined
in
--
in
the
appropriations
committees
and
the
congress
as
a
whole
in
1956,
1957,
1958,
they
approved
it
on
that
basis.
now
in
1955,
they
tried
to
get
through
a
special
act
of
by
which
they'd
have
a
right
of
judicial
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
of
the
toll
rates
that
were
fixed
on
the
panama
canal.
and
the
committee
examined
in
their
hearings,
this
question
and
they
unanimously
reported
the
bill
out,
but
they
recognized
in
their
report
that
there
was
no
authority
for
such
judicial
review
at
this
time
and
that
bill
went
to
the
floor
and
it
was
called
up
three
different
times
and
objections
were
made
each
time
and
it
failed
the
passage
and
it's
never
been
passed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
is
the
--
the
size
of
the
vessel
and
there
--
there
are
great
many
ways
of
computing
it
but
apparently,
they
work
it
out.
at
one
time
in
the
early
days,
panama
had
a
different
scale
of
measurement
for
measuring
vessels
from
the
united
states
and
the
rate
was
fixed
by
president
taft
at
a
$1.40
--
$1.20
cents
and
the
effect
of
that,
because
of
the
different
rate
of
measurement
of
panama
was
that
it
was
a
low
rate
and
--
but
that
--
that
was
eliminated
in
1937,
that
difference
in
measurement.
the
basic
problem
that
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
discretion
that
has
to
be
exercised
by
the
petitioner
in
the
present,
in
the
operation
of
these
great
properties
and
the
united
states
recognizes
that
this
is
an
international
waterway,
that
it
has
an
obligation
to
the
people
of
this
country
and
the
rest
of
the
world
that
it'd
be
properly
operated
without
discrimination
and
theory,
but
it
also
has
an
obligation
to
try
to
carry
out
the
will
of
congress
as
expressed
and
it
has
innumerable
business
problems
day
by
day
to
try
to
work
this
out.
now,
the
comptroller
general
says
that
the
various
commodities
of
the
business
operations
and
the
services
that
are
rendered
by
this
petitioner
should
be
priced
differently,
so
there
wouldn't
be
this
deficit,
so
they
could
take
care
of
all
this
--
this
overhead
of
this
corporation
and
half
the
cost
of
the
canal
zone
government.
now,
they
want
the
application
of
those
cost
of
the
operation
of
the
overhead
and
of
the
government
to
be
applied
unit
by
unit
and
it's
just
impossible
to
do
because
for
example,
let
me
point
out
to
you,
that
in
the
commissaries,
they
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
different
items
that
people
buy
and
you
can't
price
those
items
at
a
price
that's
above
the
market.
it's
just
like
a
drugstore
or
a
grocery
store,
if
you
have
a
package
of
cereals
in
your
--
the
neighboring
grocery
price
of
a
certain
amount,
you've
got
to
be
competitive.
and
if
you
put
your
price
too
high,
you
will
not
sell
that
package
and
you
will
not
sell
other
things.
and
consequently,
your
gross
income
will
go
down,
your
opportunity
to
take
care
a
part
of
this
overhead
would
be
even
more
reduced
and
you
can't
do
business
on
that
kind
of
a
basis.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
this
is
the
problem
that
seems
to
me
inherent
if
this
court
undertakes
to
judicially
review
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
petitioner
in
the
light
of
the
comptroller
general's
criticism
of
its
books
because
it
seems
to
me
the
court
then
has
to
undertake
and
say,
“well,
you
should
raise
the
prices
on
your
services,
you
should
raise
the
prices
on
your
commodities
--
excuse
me
--
in
all
your
various
business
activities
and
that
will
get
you
enough
money,
so
these
tolls
don't
have
to
be
so
high."
that's
the
argument.
now,
the
fact
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
they
really
say,
"we
don't
care
whether
you
lose
money
or
not.
if
you
lose
money
on
your
business
activities
even
though
we
construe
this
language
to
say
that
on
412
(b)
that
the
"tolls
shall
be
prescribed
at
a
rate
or
rates
calculated
to
cover,
as
nearly
as
practicable,
all
costs
of
maintaining
and
operating
the
panama
canal,
together
with
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
related
thereto,"
which
we
construed
to
mean
all
of
these
business
activities.
they
say
if
you
don't
get
that,
it's
just
too
bad.
you
just
take
it
off
the
interest.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
--
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
in
the
first
place,
it
was
never
contemplated
by
the
statute
that
there'd
be
judicial
review
that
involves
the
act
of
the
president
and
the
congress
said
it
was
found
conclusive.
but
there
was
never
any
judicial
review
before
and
it
was
never
claimed
or
contemplated
under
the
prior
statute
that
had
much
the
same
terms
and
only
placing
it
in
the
--
in
the
hands
of
the
president,
that
this
is
the
property
of
the
united
states
and
that
this
court
treats
the
handling
of
that
different,
then
if
it
was
regulation
of
the
personal
property
or
personal
rights
of
individuals
that
they
--
this
court
recognizes
that
the
united
states
has
a
right
to
price
its
various
operations
of
its
own
property.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
the
only
claim
is
that
we
didn't
--
we
are
not
carrying
out
the
terms
of
the
statute
that
when
the
statute
says
facilities
and
appurtenances
shall
be
taken
into
account
so
that
the
tolls
will
pay
all
of
that
together
with
all
of
the
cost
of
operation.
their
claim
is
of
that
that
means,
only
the
business
operations
that
were
put
in
the
company
in
1951.
there
--
there
were
some
business
operations
put
in
the
company
in
1949
and
there
were
some
before.
and
in
the
charter
and
in
other
legislation
that
was
passed
in
1949,
it
expressly
refers
to
many
of
these
different
operations
as
being
facilities
and
appurtenances,
but
because
in
the
section
14
of
this
amendment,
it
refers
to
the
transfer
of
the
remaining
business
operations
into
this,
as
facilities
and
appurtenances.
they
want
the
court
to
take
that
limited
language
and
apply
that
kind
of
a
construction
to
it,
which
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
claim
that
they
have
that
right.
they
claim
they
have
a
greater
right
if
the
petitioner
doesn't.
but
they
--
they
claim
that
they
still
have
the
right
of
the
president.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
correct
except
in
response
to
that,
we
have
said
to
the
courts
and
to
the
congress
time
after
time,
we
have
done
something.
we
have
a
--
we
have
operated
this
business.
we've
tried
to
apply
this
formula.
we
have
found
that
according
to
the
formula
in
order
to
get
all
the
cost
back
of
operating
this
canal
and
all
of
these
business
operations
that
are
part
of
it,
that
we
have
to
have
to
have
these
much
tolls
and
it's
therefore
our
determination
that
this
is
a
proper
toll
and
it
should
not
be
changed.
we
reported
that
to
the
congress,
the
congress
has
voted
appropriations,
the
presidents,
bureau
of
the
budget
have
approved
those
that
had
budget.
and
1956,
1957,
1958,
the
congress
approved
it
after
hearings
and
all
of
its
various
procedures.
and
so
we
say
that
the
procedures
that
we
are
following
are
exactly
what
congress
in
--
interpreted
this
statute
to
be
and
where
carrying
it
out,
they
say
we're
not
and
they
want
this
court
to
take
and
review
that.
now,
if
you
get
down
to
the
merits,
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
you
and
--
and
i
are
going
to
review
it
and
determine
that
we
have
to
do
all
these
things.
you've
got
to
tell
us
how
to
operate
this
corporation
and
all
these
business
facilities
and
whether
to
raise
the
prices
or
lower.
and
look
what
they've
asked
us
to
do.
they
say
this
brings
benefits,
we
shouldn't
be
giving
to
these
employees
down
in
the
panama
canal
region
and
they
admit.
it's
conceded
that
it's
a
common
thing
in
a
foreign
area
to
do
that,
but
if
we
take
those
fringed
benefits
away
in
the
business
activities
and
we
have
less
of
a
loss
there,
what
happens,
we
have
to
raise
the
salaries
and
wages
over
in
the
direct
operation
of
the
canal
and
consequently,
they
don't
gain
a
thing
by
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
of
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
a
--
sustained
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
it's
a
remarkable
thing
that
they
could
do
it
because
the
lower
court
didn't
even
consider
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
summary
judgment
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
on
2
--
page
258.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
you've
got
to
look
at
the
opinion
in
order
to
determine
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
prayer
for
relief
is
summarized
in
our
brief,
a
footnote
(inaudible)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
page
8
of
the
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
regard
to
the
last
question
that
was
asked
me
about
the
judgment
of
the
court,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
first
that
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
that
question
was
not
supposed
to
be
before
the
court
at
all,
because
the
lower
court
expressly
stayed
that
question
and
examined
into
only
the
question
of
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
act
in
this
manner
at
all.
but
in
spite
of
that
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
the
government
was
advised
by
the
lower
court
that
we
would
have
a
full
opportunity
to
answer
the
some
60
pages
of
the
affidavits
and
over
500
pages
of
congressional
record
and
materials
that
were
presented
under
the
summary,
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
on
its
merits
and
it
then
proceeded
after
that
as
you
will
note
by
the
opinion
to
examine
into
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
pass
on
that.
now
the
court
sustained
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
except
that
it
did
not
permit
any
refund
of
the
tolls
that
had
been
paid
or
reparations,
and
the
detail
of
the
prayer,
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
appears
on
page
11
of
the
record
in
this
case.
and
it
is
of
particular
interest,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
certain
parts
of
it,
because
in
paragraph
one,
the
motion
is
that
the
defendant
be
directed
to
proceed,
to
prescribe
tolls
as
provided
in
the
statute,
to
propose
changes
in
the
tolls
and
to
conduct
a
public
hearing.
then
the
second
paragraph
is
enjoining
and
restraining
the
defendant
from
further
unlawful
withholding
and
unreasonably
delaying
the
prescription
of
tolls,
proposal
of
changes
in
the
conduct
of
a
public
hearing
and
then
the
third
paragraph
commands
and
directs
us
which
is
mandatory,
a
mandamus
or
a
mandatory
injunction
and
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
outside
of
the
district
of
columbia,
except
for
action
that's
ancillary
to
their
jurisdiction,
do
not
have
the
power
to
grant
relief
of
that
character
unless
the
statutes
expressly
so
provides.
but
regardless
of
that,
we're
directed
expressly,
commanding
and
directing
and
then
the
next
one
is
enjoining
and
restraining
us
from
using
any
account,
that
are
less
favorable
than
the
comptroller
general
use
and
the
fifth
one
is
retaining
jurisdiction,
so
as
to
issue
appropriate
orders
that
the
defendant
prescribe
tolls
and
proposed
changes
in
tolls
and
conduct
a
public
hearing
according
to
law.
now
if
you
will
refer
to
page
167
of
our
brief
and
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down,
there
is
provided
further
and
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
167
that
says
what
we
we're
to
do
about
changes.
just
ahead
of
that
is
the
first
proviso
that
says
that
we
can
maintain
the
prevailing
rate
and
the
measurement
in
effect
on
that
date,
shall
continue
in
effect
until
changed
as
provided
in
this
section.
that's
the
power
that
we
rely
on
to
continue
the
$0.90
rate
that
now
is
continued
in
effect
if
the
petitioner
finds
that
it
is
profit,
and
that
the
congress
so
contemplated.
then
we
turn
to
the
next
proviso
and
it
says
that
the
fed
corporation
shall
give
six
months
notice,
what
kind
of
a
notice
is
it?
what
is
it
going
to
give
notice
of?
by
publication
in
the
federal
register
of
any
and
all
proposed
changes
in
basic
rules
of
measurement
and
of
any
and
all
proposed
changes
in
rates
of
tolls,
so
that
until
we
decide,
the
petitioner
decides
at
least
and
possibly
the
president
too
or
at
least
the
petitioner
must
decide,
that
there
has
to
be
a
change.
we
can't
have
any
hearing
because
that's
the
construction
of
a
statute.
the
statute
contemplates
that
the
petitioner
has
to
first
decide
that
there
is
to
be
a
change
in
the
tolls.
then
it
publishes
it
for
six
months
in
the
federal
register,
and
there
after
it
proceeds
to
have
hearings
during
that
six-month
period
and
those
hearings
are
not
administrative
hearings
during
which
you
make
a
record
for
review
of
a
court
like
in
the
ordinary
regulatory
agency.
they
are
legislative
hearings
just
like
the
provision
that
was
in
effect
before,
when
the
president
had
the
power
to
fix
the
tolls.
so
if
we
don't
start
first
to
decide
that
there
has
to
be
a
change
in
these
tolls,
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
hearing
and
none
is
contemplated,
because
there
is
no
purpose
for
it
and
then
it's
only
a
legislative
hearing.
now
that's
clearly
what
the
statutes
contemplated
and
all
that
it
provides
and
we
are
directed
mandatorily
to
proceed
to
decide
that
there
must
be
a
change
when
we
have
decided
that
there
need
not
be
one
and
then
proceed
with
hearings
when
we
decided
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
change,
therefore
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
a
hearing
and
that's
the
character
of
relief
that
was
given.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
isn't
contemplated
by
the
statute
and
before
that
it
wasn't
contemplated
that
anybody
but
the
president
could
do
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
not
because
--
they
have
to
report
every
year
to
the
congress
and
the
congress
reviews
their
budget,
appropriates
money,
the
money
is
all
covered
into
the
treasury,
large
great
portion
of
it
anyway
and
so
the
congress
is
constantly
examining,
and
they've
recommended
that
they
give
up
the
panama
railroad
and
not
operate
it
anymore,
that
is
the
company
and
that
congress
wouldn't
let
them.
they've
been
watching
this
very
closely
every
year
and
all
the
budgets
and
appropriations
and
so
forth.
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
doesn't
think
that
action
is
reviewable.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
and
the
courts
don't
do
those
things
ordinarily.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i'd
like
to
cover
the
inquiry
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
appropriations
and
if
we
refer
to
page
16
of
the
report
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
don't
have
this
but
i
--
it's
the
report
of
the
comptroller
general
that's
been
the
subject
of
talk
and
debate
all
the
way
through
this
and
upon
which
they
rely
from
time
to
time
when
they
think
they
can
gain
something
out
of
it
and
which
they
overlook
whenever
they
find
it's
to
their
advantage.
they
overlooked
the
part
in
which
the
comptroller
general
said
that
the
formula
for
tolls
should
be
changed
to
make
sure
that
the
cost
to
these
business
activities
should
not
be
charged
against
the
taxpayer
and
that
it
should
be
incorporated
in
the
tolls
charge,
that's
one
thing
they
overlooked.
they
apparently
overlooked
this
language
of
the
comptroller
general
in
the
same
report
on
page
16.
if
tolls
revenue
is
insufficient
to
cover
the
minimum
losses
appropriations
will
be
needed,
such
appropriations
for
the
business
losses
would
of
course
constitute
a
subsidy
to
the
ship
operators.
comptroller
general
said
that
in
exactly
the
same
report
that
we've
been
discussing
all
the
way
through
here.
now
in
regard
to
the
military,
the
military
reimburses
the
canal
zone
government
in
full
for
all
the
school
and
hospital
service,
so
that
isn't
in
here
at
all.
they
were
allowed
because
of
the
defense
features
of
this
canal
zone
operation
that
the
congress
recognized,
they
took
out
of
the
formula
of
the
amount
the
government
had
invested
in
this
canal,
what
they
had
--
the
government
had
collected
for
some
40
years
of
time
without
any
objection
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
great
britain
or
anybody
else
and
that
was
the
cost
of
the
interest
for
the
construction
period.
and
that's
a
proper
accounting
charge
because
it
did
cost
this
government
that
amount
of
money.
but
in
recognition
of
the
defense
aspect,
the
congress
took
that
out
in
figuring
the
amount
of
the
investment
that
we
had
in
the
canal,
and
that's
2500
–
that's
$2.5
million
a
year,
they've
already
got
that
credit
for
defense
and
they
just
want
to
try
to
get
some
more.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
goes
to
the
merits
mr.
justice,
but
i'm
trying
to
reach
the
merit
sometimes
because
we're
badly
bothered,
i'll
deal
with
that
next,
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
the
merits,
we
don't
agree
to
all
these
things
that
are
claimed
in
these
affidavits.
the
petitioner
acted
in
good
faith
in
this
case.
the
department
of
justices
reviewed
it,
the
bureau
of
the
budget
and
we
think
the
petitioner
in
--
has
properly
decided
that
there
should
be
no
change
in
these
tolls
and
we
construe
the
action
of
the
congress
to
exactly
the
same
effect
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
affidavit
was
only
asked
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
had
power
to
examine
this
subject
matter.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
it
was
10
pages.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
i
call
you
attention
to
what
judge
walsh
said
on
that
very
subject
in
the
colloquy
that
was
extended
between
the
parties.
and
on
--
that's
in
the
record
on
page
202,
at
about
the
second
full
paragraph,
down,
and
the
court
–
“if
you
want
assurance
that
i'm
not
going
to
pass
on
the
merits
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
delay,
but
only
this
court's
power
to
hear
the
whole
question,
why
i
will
give
that
to
you
right
now.”
in
other
words,
the
only
question
that
is
going
to
be
raised
on
december
22nd
is
whether
this
court
can
hear
the
case
to
begin
with
and
the
only
answer
that
you
can
get
is
either
one,
we
can't
even
hear
it;
or
two,
we
can
hear
it.
then
he
goes
out
and
if
conclude
“we
can
hear
it
there
will
be
fresh
slate
and
a
fresh
start
on
who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
mr.
williams,
counsel
for
the
respondents
claim
that
the
10-page
affidavit
on
behalf
of
the
government
was
a
moving
motion
and
therefore
it
should
be
construed
as
an
answer.
and
the
court
would
not
do
that
and
expressly
ruled
on
an
affirmative
motion
we
made
that
the
whole
action
on
the
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
be
stayed
until
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
determined.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
there
would
be
no
judicial
review
in
any
event
because
i
think
you
have
partially
here
the
question
that
we
say,
we've
acted,
and
under
our
construction
of
the
statute
it
seems
to
me
that
in
any
event
it
isn't
clear
what
we
should
do.
and
so
there
isn't
any
claim
that
--
there
can't
be
any
proper
claim
under
our
construction
of
it,
that
were
acting
in
bad
faith
and
that
that
element
comes
in
to
require
judicial
review.
we
also
say
that
in
any
event
it
was
improper
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
summary
judgment
and
decide
this
case
on
the
merits
because
we
were
sure
that
it
would
not
and
the
action
of
the
lower
court
was
expressly
that
it
would
not
be.
then
on
page
205,
there
is
a
further
statement
by
judge
walsh,
about
the
middle
of
the
page
or
toward
the
upper
half
of
it,
the
court,
“now
i'm
going
to
grant
your
motion
to
defer
hearing
on
the
merits
until
we
pass
on
this
jurisdictional
point.”
now
that's
what
the
court
did
and
we've
never
had
a
chance
to
answer
some
of
these
contentions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
secondly
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
did
take
the
position
all
the
way
through
and
we
do
know
that
we
have
examined
this
formula
and
we've
tried
to
apply
it
in
good
faith
and
we
find
that
under
the
formula
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
the
petitioner?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
the
record
is
not
complete
on
that
because
it's
under
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
it
from
all
the
reports
that
we
made
to
congress
in
which
we
set
out
at
length
in
our
briefs,
the
fact
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
exactly
they
are
very
precise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
have
by
judicial
notice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
we
call
attention
to
them
at
length,
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
you
don't
have
this
document
but
you
have
a
reference
to
it
and
i'll
tell
you
how
you
take
judicial
notice
of
it
and
what
we
have
to
deal
with
in
this
case.
we
have
these
annual
reports
for
the
stockholders
that
were
made
by
this
petitioner
to
its
one
stockholder,
and
they
are
preliminary
reports,
they
say
on
their
face
and
we've
said
that
out
at
length
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
haven't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
detail
now
here
is
the
annual
report
of
the
petitioner,
the
panama
canal
company
that's
a
house
document,
number
99
and
it's
been
made
each
year
except
for
1957
and
it
hasn't
gotten
to
place
yet
where
we
could
make
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
printers
and
that's
the
only
reason
that
you
haven't
got
the
last
one.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
have
a
reference
to
the
toll
charges,
you
have
the
sustaining
business
activities
and
how
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
since
1954
in
detail
in
june
and
july
for
the
first
time
before
they
were
filled
to
the
comptroller
general's
report,
we
told
them
exactly
how
these
tolls
were
computed,
how
the
business
operations,
deficits
would
be
figured
in
accordance
with
the
comptroller
general's,
how
we
felt
at
the
tolls
should
not
be
changed,
then
when
the
comptroller
general's
report
was
made
we
gave
a
detailed
report
in
which
we
told
them
exactly
our
theory
as
i've
outlined
in
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'll
be
glad
to
furnish
those
to
the
court
but
those
are
governmental
documents
and
they've
been
made
every
year
and
there
is
almost
a
100
pages
of
statistics
of
all
these
things
in
the
completest
detail
about
how
this
is
conducted.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
position
is
that,
that
is
not
in
this
case
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
because
of
the
construction
of
the
statute
i
think,
which
--
i
don't
think
gets
into
flagrant
action
as
you're
contemplating
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
my
position
on
that
is
that
the
ground
is
that
the
difficulty
of
the
discretion
that's
involved
here,
that
counsel
conceded
there
was
some
discretion.
now
if
you
examine
this
formula
in
412(b)
as
we
have
tried
to
do
in
absolute
good
faith,
then
i
hope
this
court
if
it
acts
in
this
case
and
rules
against
the
petitioner
will
give
us
some
guidance
as
to
how
we're
to
try
to
fix
these
rates
because
if
you
examine
this
formula
as
we
have
tried
to
do
in
absolute
good
faith,
you
find
first
that
they
say
the
toll
should
be
prescribed
at
the
rate
or
rates
calculated
to
cover
the
words
‘as
nearly
as
practicable
all
costs,'
not
part
of
it,
all
costs
of
maintaining
and
operating
the
panama
canal
together
with
the
facilities
and
appurtenances
related
thereto,
including
interest
and
depreciation.
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
and
this
is
the
controversy
between
us,
“and
an
appropriate
share
of
the
net
costs
of
the
operation
of
the
agency
known
as
the
canal
zone
government.”
now
if
you're
in
our
position,
as
the
petitioner,
how
would
you
try
to
interpret
it
there?
if
you
were
told
by
somebody
to
try
to
pay
certain
obligations
or
bills,
including
the
interest
on
a
note
to
the
bank
or
something,
and
that
instruction
was
insofar
as
practicable,
you
should
pay
it
all,
and
then
you
should
go
ahead
and
take
an
appropriate
share
of
some
other
bills.
and
if
you
try
to
not
pay
all
these,
which
is
the
expense
of
operation
of
all
of
these
various
activities
that
are
necessary
to
this
operation
of
this
canal
zone,
then
your
business
can't
continue
any
longer
because
you
would
have
deficits,
that's
the
problem
that
we
have.
and
we've
done
the
best
we
could
to
apply
that
very
formula
to
our
operations,
and
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
have
a
different
problem.
if
you
can
look
at
that
statute,
the
court
can,
with
all
respect,
and
say
if
this
statute
is
so
clear
that
there
is
no
discretion
that
has
to
be
exercised
by
the
petitioner,
and
you
can
just
take
that
statute,
apply
it
to
your
affairs
and
it's
clear
as
can
be
that
you
should
do
this
very
thing.
then
of
course
the
court
found
that
we
were
violating
that,
it
would
be
just
a
clear
act
that
the
court
could
direct
us
to
go,
get
about
our
business
and
do
them,
but
that
isn't
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'd
say
it's
different
in
this
case,
but
that
isn't
here
in
this
case,
that
there
are
circumstances
where
if
this
--
if
you
assume
the
statute
was
different,
if
you
assume
it
was
all
clear,
and
there
was
nothing
we
should
do
except
go
ahead
and
change
the
tolls,
anybody
could
see
that,
and
that
they
should
be
changed
because
this
formula
was
so
clear,
there
was
no
discretion
involved,
no
judgment,
all
of
those
things,
well
then
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
say
go
ahead
and
do
your
job,
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
the
--
where
the
court
can
reach
this
particular
problem
that
--
it
doesn't
have
to
get
into
the
area
of
when
review
would
be
permissible
because
it
would
come
under
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
take
both
positions
mr.
justice.
may
i
have
one
more
further
statement
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'd
like
to
clear
up
this
business
of
necessary
facilities
and
appurtenances
because
i
think
the
construction
claimed
by
respondents
is
entirely
unfair.
on
page
157
of
our
brief,
we
set
out
section
51
of
this
particular
statute,
which
was
passed
by
the
same
congress
that
dealt
with
the
1950
act.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
to
try
to
limit
the
words
of
facilities
and
appurtenances,
to
what
they
claim
in
section
10
of
the
statute,
is
not
fair
or
realistic
at
all
when
the
same
congress
elaborates
in
section
51,
the
latter
half
of
that
page,
in
detail,
all
of
these
various
things;
the
dredging
facilities,
docks,
wharfs,
sewer
systems,
civil
air
terminals,
the
commissaries,
store
houses,
quarters
and
any
other
necessary
facilities
and
appurtenances.
now
that's
the
way
this
very
same
congress
used
the
words
facilities
and
appurtenances
within
five
or
six
months
and
clearly
within
the
period
they
were
considering
this
whole
thing.
and
they
only
use
facilities
and
appurtenances
in
the
limited
manner
they
did
in
section
10,
because
that
was
only
that
portion
of
those
facilities
and
appurtenances
that
were
contemplated
to
be
transferred
because
the
rest
had
been.
but
if
you
read
these
together
i
think
any
reasonable
construction
and
this
court
in
ex
rel.
rogers
versus
graves
has
already
long
before
taken
the
position
that
all
of
these
various
activities
were
a
part
of
the
necessary
operations
of
this
canal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
(inaudible)
chief
justice,
i
can
explain,
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
[attempt
to
laughter]
it's
all
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
apparently
someone
inquired
of
mr.
chandler
and
mr.
chandler
said
that
he
thought
it
was
not
a
proper
subject
for
judicial
review
and
then
he
received
a
communication
from
judge
clark
suggesting
that
it
should
be
and
he
changed
his
opinion
and
so
advised
the
committee.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
can
only
guess
that
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
