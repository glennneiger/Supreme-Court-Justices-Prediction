industry
for
what,
on
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
canal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
--
during
all
that
period,
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
there's
--
there
was
equality
of
toll
treatment
as
to
all
the
flags
that
we're
going
through?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can
you
take
that
issue
out
of
this
case
in
a
word
right
now?
is
that
involved
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
is
--
is
--
any
question
of
discrimination
involved
in
--
in
the
issue
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
that's
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
the
thing
that
came
to
ahead
by
the
repeal
of
the
earliest
statute
in
1912
is
not
involved
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
noticed
but
have
not
read
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
great
britain
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
whether
that
matter
is
diplomatically
before
the
country
or
nearly
as
a
brief
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
is
there
--
isn't
that
--
are
you
free
to
say
whether
any
representation
has
been
made
by
great
britain
on
the
question
diplomatically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
take
one
more
minute
to
ask
you
whether
in
your
view,
the
point
of
view
of
the
government,
we
are
at
all
called
upon
(inaudible)
whether
we
are
called
upon
to
construe
the
hay-pauncefote
treaty
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
that
i
asked
is
because
in
the
few
cases
that
we've
had
in
this
court
involving
such
treaty,
the
court,
i
think
wanted
to
receive
the
views
of
the
state
department
regarding
the
construction.
so,
all
the
historic
and
complicated
in
--
instrument
is
a
hay-pauncefote
treaty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
do
not
like
to
give
us
advice
but
--
but
i
should
think
even
you
would
want
it
from
the
state
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
statute
must
be
read
and
interpreted
in
the
light
of
what
are
deemed
to
be
the
demand
of
the
treaty.
that's
their
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
gets
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
you
reach
the
merit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
--
where
is
the
proprietor?
where
is
the
provision
regarding
the
president's
relation
to
the
problem
under
the
new
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
further
down,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
under
either
this
statute
as
the
general
statute
for
the
government
of
the
canal,
was
the
president
had
power
to
prompt
it
as
i
understand
initiate
action
--
prompt
action
on
the
part
of
the
canal
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
the
whole
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
been
changed
since
the
original
act
or
not
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
you
--
why
are
you
putting
these
matters
to
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
suggest
that
we
have
to
go
to
those
matters
or
they
merely
say,
"you
ought
to
--
you
ought
to
do
something
and
get
new
rate?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
they
--
would
the
respondent
agree
with
you
that
we
have
to
take
into
account
the
conflict
that
we
have
to
--
that
the
decision
which
stayed
out
to
be
sustained
involves
reaching
the
items
that
you
put
before
us,
the
last
two
or
three
minutes
that
we
have
to
consider
things
like
that?
i
can't
imagine
the
--
i
don't
myself
feel
securely
qualified
to
pass
on
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
a
suggestion
that
--
that
the
--
the
tolls
that
are
charged
and
sought
to
be
left
to
be
charged
as
they
are
involves
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
from
the
consumer
to
which
the
ship
owners
could
go
through
the
canal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
does
that
mean
that
if
the
president
promulgates
a
toll
and
set
forth
in
the
document
that
some
experts
have
joined
with
them
and
it
defines
this
and
this
as
appurtenances
and
facilities,
there
can
be
judicial
review
as
to
whether
he
properly
denominated
those
appurtenance
and
facilities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you?
i
always
find
it
proper
to
find
out,
what
--
what
the
judgment
is
which
i'm
asked
to
either
reverse
or
sustain.
what
is
it
that
the
court
of
appeals
directed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
is
the
judgment?
what
is
--
what
is
the
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
have
asked
somebody
to
do
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
what
summary
judgment
which
was
--
what's
the
summary
judgment
which
they
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
taught
that
there
must
be
some
--
some
indication
as
to
what
the
court
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
258?
so
that
law
if
we
sustain
this,
you
would
have
to
advice
--
the
committee
have
to
advice
the
panama
canal
company
to
do
something
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
prayer
for
relief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
common
law
pleading.
that's
something
to
be
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
i
like
to
put
to
you,
i
hope
mr.
williams
will
deal
with
it
when
he
gets
on
his
feet,
this
question?
suppose
this
court
affirmed
the
court
of
appeals,
suppose
it
was
to
affirm
it
without
an
opinion
to
infer,
and
then
the
panama
canal
company
says
here
we've
got
an
order
of
the
court,
an
order
of
the
supreme
court,
and
we
go
the
court
of
appeals
to
figure,
to
find
out
what
it
is,
that
it
contemplated
and
they
say
that
we
think,
the
rates
that
we
fixed,
the
existing
rates
are
within
the
scope
and
the
authority
in
the
act
of
congress,
but
we
are
an
obedient
agency
and
we'll
do
the
best
we
can
on
the
basis
of
what
we
deem
to
be
false
assumptions
in
fact,
to
change
the
tolls.
the
matter
then
goes
to
the
president,
he
says
they
are
all
wrong
and
he
disallows
the
changed
tolls,
he
says
the
old
tolls
shall
remain
in
force.
i
would
like
to
hear
from
both
sides
whether
that
determination
by
the
president
is
then
reviewable
by
any
court,
so
that
we
go
around
and
get
the
same
result
by
the
presidential
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
if
the
hypothesis
that
i
put
to
you
of
the
assumption
that
i've
indicated
in
my
question
are
carried
out,
all
these
things
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
may
i,
may
i
interrupt
you,
i
don't
know
about
the
other,
but
i
have
a
statute
question
in
mind
about
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
humboldt,
it's
a
very
different
situation,
because
there
a
private
shipper
by
statute
is
given
authority
to
go
before
the
commission
and
get
action
and
unless
you
contradict
what
the
answer
given
to
justice
douglas's
question,
is
that
the
situation
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
lots
of
actions
commanded
by
statute
upon
members
of
the
cabinet
for
which
i
don't
suppose
you
would
get
mandamus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
legislative
policy
on
the
part
of
department
to
give
subsidy,
a
grant
and
suppose
if
you
can
get
mandamus
it's
advised
in
the
parliament
within
discretionary
power,
ultimately
it
is
the
president
to
decide
what
the
figure
should
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
president
next
day
may
nullify
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
upshot
of
the
28
pages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
read
it,
but
i
thought
it
went
on
the
fact
that
the
president
has
the
ultimate
say
in
the
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
i
have
in
mind
the
norwegian
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
not
acting
you
don't
think
they
have
acted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
words
mr.
williams.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
starts
with
the
assumption
of
administrative
procedure
act
applies
to
this
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
that
be
taken
for
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
they
agree,
then
i
don't
see
why
mr.
solicitor
general
should
have
made
the
argument
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
williams
does
the
act
give
--
is
the
act
explicit
as
to
any
relation
between
the
comptroller
general
and
the
operations
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
finding
of
(inaudible)
that
is
based
on
what,
on
affidavits
and
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
was
that
relevant
for
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
comptroller
general's
views
or
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
mean
does
that
enter
into
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
evidence
of
what
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
was
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
that
issue
was
contested
in
the
district
court,
or
whether
we
are
to
take
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
what
is
or
is
not
the
fact
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
understand
it's
challenge
is
that
the
issue
of
a
summary
judgment
was
not
contested
or
canvassed
in
a
district
court,
but
the
court
of
appeal
on
its
own
having
decided
there
is
standing,
then
went
to
the
-
-dealt
with
merits
and
it
was
never
canvassed
in
the
district
court,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understand
the
government,
and
i
understand
the
solicitor
general,
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
it
is
claimed
that
in
any
events
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
business
to
go
the
merits,
after
they
decided
the
jurisdictional
question
in
your
favor,
because
the
district
court
having
gone
into
that,
am
i
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
court
--
that
the
government
is
content
to
have
that
issue
decided
on
the
situation,
in
this
posture
in
which
it
was
left
in
the
court
of
appeals,
when
the
merits
of
that,
for
all
i
know,
might
be
challenged
by
the
government.
i
know
the
comptroller
general
is
(inaudible)
nothing
against
him,
but
even
he
is
an
infallible
creature,
isn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
insofar
as
its
findings
of
what
kind
of
books
they
should
have
kept,
unless
the
government
gets
up
and
says
yes
you
are
to
assume
that
we
agree
with
that,
and
we
you
wouldn't
contest
that,
how
can
i
take
it
for
granted
that
they
wouldn't
if
the
matter
were
before
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
general
counsel
of
the
company
gave
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
president
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
defendant
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
who
is
the
president
of
the
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
and
he
was
a
creature,
using
the
word
respectfully,
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
president
of
the
canal
zone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
seybold
was
an
army
officer,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
was
trying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
president
designated
members
of
the
engineering
corps
(inaudible)
as
i
understand,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
was
an
appointee
of
the
president?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
any
presidential
conformation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
a
(inaudible)
he
was
an
appointee
of
the
president
without
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
part
of
a
member
of
the
engineering
corps.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
when
was
that
changed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it
became
a
civil
government
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
relation
between
having
the
armed
forces
there
and
having
the
canal
in
effective
operations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
also
to
prevent
the
canal
from
having
pearl
harbor
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
include
school
expenses
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
employees
of
the
canal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
school
system
to
which
both
armed
forces
children
and
canal
employees'
children
directed
to
go,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
of
the
problems
is
the
allocation
of
that
expense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
issue,
isn't
it?
in
the
financing,
in
the
accounting
of
the
business
that
is
one
of
the
problems,
the
canal
company
would
have
to
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
that
the
whole
cost
of
the
military
establishment
in
the
zone
is
the
basis
for
the
toll
charges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
merits
of
the
accounting
of
the
financial
allocation,
what
it
gets
down
to
is,
what
may
fairly
be
charged
for
services
in
which
there
is
a
mixed
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
suggesting
i'm
sure
that
up
to
1950
the
tolls
were
fixed
by
presidential
authority
under
whimsical
or
willful
basis,
putting
it
to
one
side,
you
will
agree
won't
you
that
from
the
beginning,
the
proper
basis
of
determining
what
the
toll
charges
should
be
was
in
the
hand
of
technical
advisors
of
the
president,
on
the
basis
of
which
these
toll
charges
from
time
to
time
were
reviewed,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
what
the
basis
was,
but
that
the
presidential
authority
exercised
up
till
1950
was
an
effort
to
relate
tolls
to
value
of
services.
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
1950
the
thing
was
formalized
by
section
412,
is
that
right?
i
don't
mean
formalized
was
refined
by
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
this
allowed
them
no
maneuvering
room?
no,
no,
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
the
contention
of
the
government,
after
the
act
of
1950,
and
indeed
before
it,
the
panama
canal
company
and
its
various
names
each
year
had
to
come
before
congress,
give
an
accounting
of
what
they
did
the
year
before,
state
financial
conditions,
its
income,
its
expenditures,
state
what
the
tolls
were
on
the
basis
of
which
the
appropriations
for
the
next
year
were
made,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
you
to
draw
inferences
from
it,
but
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
the
tolls
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
not
the
company
report
what
the
tolls
are
for
the
preceding
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
doesn't
go
to
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
the
president
submit
something
or
somebody
submits
the
congress
a
report
of
the
panama
canal
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
stockholder
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
owns
the
stock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
put
that
to
you
is
because
this
court
has
in
other
situations
find
it's
important
in
the
submission
to
congress
of
a
report
of
action
which
--
the
legality
of
which
was
questioned,
but
because
submitted
to
congress
and
acted
upon
or
at
least
not
rejected
by
congress
draws
legal
force.
that
happens
in,
if
i
may
say
so
cases
involving
even
more
serious
issues
than
dollars
and
cents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
referring
to
seattle
against
(inaudible)
in
238
u.s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you're
right,
and
if
the
government
is
unfairly
or
illegally
extracting
toll
from
your
client
when
it
shouldn't,
in
order
to
be
relieved
of
the
cost
of
other
activities,
then
if
you're
right
the
government
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states
would
have
to
make
appropriations
for
those
other
non-canal
operating
activities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not,
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
even
at
the
reduced
rates
that
you're
asking
for,
if
you
take
them
off
the
income
of
the
(inaudible)
would
make
no
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
either
appropriations
would
be
required
or
income
would
have
been
earned
which
–
and
some
action
would
have
been
taken.
if
it's
a
surplus
then
it
would
be
drawn
into
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
be
some
change
in
the
fiscal
relations
of
the
canal
company
to
the
concern
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
draw
the
inference
from
you
that
congress
doesn't
know
what
it
is
you've
got
involved,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
the
suit,
is
it
familiar
with
what
the
company
did
in
the
toll
charges
it
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
that,
what
was
the
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
has
continued
since?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
has
continued,
these
illegal
charges
have
continued,
haven't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
had
noted
that
those
toll
charges
before
you
brought
your
suit
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
the
facts
of
the
charges
and
the
basis
on
which
they
were
made,
have
been
before
congress
since
this
act
of
1950?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
concealment,
is
this
concealment
anything
else
or
is
it
something
different
from
the
way
in
which
the
--
the
basis
on
which
they
imposed
the
toll,
is
that
what
you
meant
you
by
concealment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
suggestion
of
some
skullduggery
in
the
conventional
sense
of
that
term
originally
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
corporation,
the
panama
canal
company
subject
to
the
general
accounting
provisions
applicable
to
all
branches
except
by
tva,
is
it
subject
to
all
the
accounting
provisions
applicable
to
other
agencies
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
suppose
that
the
--
i
maybe
wrong,
but
if
the
panama
canal
company
like
tva
and
a
few
others,
has
its
own
independent
accounting
system,
isn't
that
right?
i
maybe
wrong
but
never
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
the
argument
you're
making
now
goes
to
the
merits
of
power
of
the
court
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
that
was
said
were
all
the
affidavits
before
the
court
that
have
been
talked
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
enlarging
(inaudible)
your
answer
to
justice
black
that
in
the
first
place
you
contend
that
there
was
action
here
and
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
but
would
you
give
your
grounds
for
making
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
is
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
–
where
do
i
find
evidence
of
that
statement
in
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
what
can
i
–
where
can
i
go
to
take
judicial
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
those
reports
--
i'm
not
clear,
do
those
reports
refer
to
the
item,
do
they
deal
with
or
give
basis
for
–
inference
of
the
fact
that
these
and
these
are
the
toll
charges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
got
those
reports?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
got
a
document,
i
don't
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
of
which
i
can
take
judicial
notice
that
these
are
matters
that
came
to
the
attention
of
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
whether
they
have
read
them,
i
know
most
congressmen
don't
read
most
of
the
reports
that
go
to
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
judicial
notice
of
that
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
do
i
find
in
there
reference
to
the
amount,
the
toll
charges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
been
given
to
congress
since
1950?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
chief
justice
(inaudible)
if
you
have
legally
available
the
copies
of
those
reports
i
think
they
might
desired
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor
may
i
ask
you
before
you
sit
down,
where
in
this
case
is
different
from
assuming,
if
you're
not
familiar
with
the
case,
then
don't
bother
to
answer,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
against
central
reio
refining
company
you
have
--
do
you
remember
that
case,
which
gave
the
sugar
act
of
1948
to
authorize
the
secretary
to
make
allotment
for
control
of
sugar,
sugar
quota
and
in
that
case
we
reversed
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
because
(inaudible)
too
severe
a
rate.
it
found
check
rate
on
the
secretary
of
agriculture
which
he
thought
was
disallowing
him
to
exercise
the
discretion
which
the
statute
(inaudible),
but
in
that
case
we
didn't
say
there
was
no
power
to
review
and
we
looked
to
the
statute
and
said
what
he
did
was
amply
within
the
discretion
vested
in
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
say
it
reaches
the
merits,
that's
the
kind
of
disposition
you
urge
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
touch
the
initial
question
which
judge
walsh
found
that
there
was
no
reviewing
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
record
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
bill
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
initially
like
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
bill,
what's
the
date
of
the
introduction
of
the
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
in
this
litigation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
while
the
litigation
was
in
prospect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
litigation
except
insofar
as
it
concerned
whether
reviewing
power
should
be
as
of
other
administrative
agencies,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
action
that
he
took
mr.
williams?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
action
that
he
took.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
saying
that
whatever
he
talked
he
thought
was
relevant
to
the
determination
whether
he
had
jurisdiction
and
one
may
have
different
views
at
what
the
arguments
which
he
adduced
did
or
did
not
establish
that
thesis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
the
thing
he
was
concerned
with.
