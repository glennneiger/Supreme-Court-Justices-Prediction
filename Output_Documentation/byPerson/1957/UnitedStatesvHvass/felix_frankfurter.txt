justice

frankfurter
this
is
an
ordinary
diversity
negligence
case
not
an
fela
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
see
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
the
record
shows
mr.
spritzer
was
this
order
of
the
court
sua
sponte?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
(inaudible)
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
colloquy
is
out
by
asking
you
whether
it
is
your
position
that
the
validity
of
the
rule
was
not
contested
the
law
either
he's
not
contested
here.
i
don't
know
which.
i
haven't
looked
at
the
brief
and
that
the
case
rest
on
the
ruling
by
the
district
court
that
law
or
the
lower
laws
of
the
statute
perjury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
means
either
statutory
law
or
i
suppose
a
regulation
carrying
out
and
allow
the
delegation
by
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
point
out
that
the
sentence
immediately
proceeding
is
an
expressed
(inaudible)
that
he
is
passing
on
the
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
latter
rather
than
what
is
available
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
you
said
last
is
that
there
is
a
limitation
upon
this
court's
power
to
review
--
the
scope
of
this
court's
power
to
review
an
influence
to
which
the
question
was
he
couldn't
and
order
a
case
relying
in
his
problems
in
a
way
is
this
court's
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
say
you
indicate
whether
you
think
--
putting
your
side
for
the
moment,
purpose
of
this
argument,
the
validity
of
this
rule
that
there
is
any
difference
between
a
rule
of
admission
to
a
district
court
and
the
oath
required
under
it
and
the
rule
of
admission
to
this
court
and
an
oath
required
under
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
to
the
next
question,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
we
do
not
require
an
oath
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
implication
of
an
affirmation
will
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
--
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
the
person
who
conscientiously
cannot
take
an
oath
for
the
firm
will
be
outside
of
the
perjury
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
for
a
test
of
foreign
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
have
talked
about
that
but
the
people
who
are
admitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
different
story
what
the
rule
--
what
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
a
different
question
as
well
as
the
question
of
policy
or
if
you
plead
the
validity
of
requiring
another
oath
by
foreign
counsel
not
admitted.
i
was
asking
whether
my
question
was
directed
and
i
was
not
suggesting,
i
was
asking
whether
the
oath
required
by
counsel
were
admitted
this
morning
taking
on
the
basis
of
--
of
allegations
they
have
to
make
(inaudible)
information
there
furnished
whether
that's
either
is
not
a
basis
on
the
law
under
the
perjury
statute,
the
basis
for
a
perjury
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
--
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
was
wondering
whether
there
is
any
difference
between
the
oath
that
i
took
when
i
was
admitted
to
the
district
court
of
new
york
and
the
oath
that
i
took
when
i
was
admitted
to
this
court
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
amenability
to
the
perjury
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
but
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
be,
although
assuming,
assuming
i
accept
your
starting
point,
namely
that
congress
couldn't
determine
the
qualifications
for
admission
to
this
courts
bar
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
started
that.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
i
don't
need
to
recite
it
because
i
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
assume
that
that
is
so.
are
you
saying
congress
couldn't
make
it
an
offense
to
commit
perjury
in
an
oath
which
this
court
has
inherent
power
to
require?
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
accepting
that
--
go
on
from
there.
i
accept
that
for
purposes
of
my
question.
assuming
that
is
so,
can
congress
not
make
it
an
offense
to
give
false
testimony
as
to
matters
which
we
require
by
the
inherent
authority
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
stop
you
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
what
you
just
said
that
when
he
gave
this
--
when
he
made
certain
statements
which
made
the
basis
of
a
charge
of
perjury
that
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement,
there
was
no
duty
on
his
part
to
--
there
was
no
duty
on
his
part
to
make
truthful
statement
because
at
least
there
was
no
rule
requiring
him
to
make
a
statement
which
are
laid
as
the
basis
of
perjury,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
repeat
--
and
then
state
what
you
said,
what
you
mean
by
saying
at
the
time
he
made
these
statements
there
was
no
such
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
local
rule
in
existence
when
he
made
these
statements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
misunderstood
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
i'm
not
--
a
man
may
--
the
directive
moral
duty
and
not
violate
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
you
say
there
never
can
be
a
statutory
prosecution
for
perjury
no
matter
how
detail
the
congress
and
spell
it
out
although
you
indicate
that
you
wouldn't
be
here
if
the
judgment
by
virtue
of
the
judicial
power,
lock
this
fellow
in
jail
for
x
month,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
--
one
might
say
that
remotely
it
has
a
legislative
base.
the
district
court
is
the
preacher
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
congress
could
wipe
it
out
tomorrow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
child
becomes
mature
on
birth,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
statutes
have
qualifications
where
people
become
judges?
