mr.
warren
b.
king
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
and
counsel.
might
i
address
myself
before
i
state
our
position
to
a
few
questions?
mr.
justice
frankfurter
compared
the
oath
required
in
the
iowa
court
to
the
oath
required
here,
i
believe,
under
rule
number
4
or
number
6
i
think
it
is,
you
do
not
require
for
an
attorneys
to
have
an
oath
and
for
many,
many
years
the
state
of
iowa
likewise
did
not
require
an
oath.
this
amendment
was
enacted
in
august
of
1955
not
to
go
in
effect
until
the
first
day
of
october
1955
and
in
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question,
the
defendant
did
not
apply
but
he
was
sent
an
order
by
the
court
stating
that
if
you
care
to
try
a
case,
you
shall
appear
and
call
his
attention
to
the
new
requirement
which
is
the
only
requirement
in
the
united
states
of
america.
all
other
states
grant
committee
in
accordance
with
the
prior
law
that
was
in
existence.
this
is
the
new
requirement
and
it
was
the
first
time
and
the
first
session
of
courts
so
they
were
ordered
to
appear.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
the
two
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
that's
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
true.
mr.
warren
b.
king
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
your
rule
says
specifically
rule
number
6
that
the
oath
does
not
require.
mr.
warren
b.
king
that's
correct.
mr.
warren
b.
king
you're
correct.
mr.
warren
b.
king
you're
correct.
mr.
warren
b.
king
if
it
--
it
would
not
be
a
basis
for
perjury
charge
because
it
must
have
a
clear
legislative
base
and
the
only
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
all
right.
now
the
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
you're
not
amenable
to
the
perjury
statute
because
there
is
not
a
valid
legislation
in
place.
mr.
warren
b.
king
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
warren
b.
king
and
i
used
it
only
in
a
sense,
mr.
justice
that
we
are
both
foreign
attorneys
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
--
because
we
were
out-of-state
attorneys.
mr.
warren
b.
king
and
call
the
illustration
that
iowa
got
along
very
well
for
80
some
years
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
--
and
you
don't
require
it.
now,
in
answering
mr.
justice
black's
question,
the
suites
in
which
were
on
the
calendar
where
the
order
issued
was
at
issue
--
the
attorneys
had
selected
their
attorney
on
minnesota
to
try
their
lawsuit
because
they
have
wished
to
do
so
and
the
case
was
on
the
calendar.
the
very
last
one
at
least
four
months
before
this
law
was
ever
enacted
or
ever
thought
of.
now
it's
our
position,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
in
other
than
a
judicial
proceeding
to
constitute
the
crime
of
perjury
under
1621
“the
law
of
the
united
states
authorizing
oath
to
be
administered
must
have
a
valid
legislative
base.otherwise,
there
can
be
no
crime.”
therefore
the
question
is
pure
and
simply
of
whether
or
not
rule
3
has
a
valid
legislative
base.
we
contend
that
it
does
not
because
congress
cannot
authorize
an
oath
in
an
admission
hearing
since
the
power
to
admit
attorneys
to
practice
in
the
federal
courts
is
inherently
a
judicial
power
and
it
is
not
legislative.
therefore
our
position
is
at
local
rule
3
is
not
such
a
law
of
the
united
states
authorizing
an
oath
so
that
this
violation
will
constitute
a
federal
crime
of
perjury
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
on
page
14,
the
government
takes
a
position
which
is
substantially
similar
because
they
say
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
clear
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
prosecution
of
perjury,
there
must
be
two
elements.
it
must
be
founded
on
legislative
base,
a
statute
of
the
united
states
for
a
rule
promulgated
pursuant
to
appellant,
delegation
of
rule
making
authority
and
because
the
legislature
has
no
authority
to
make
any
regulations
in
an
admission
hearing,
there
can
be
no
valid
delegation
of
rule
making
power.
mr.
warren
b.
king
that
is
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
that
is
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
that
is
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
i
am
saying
in
an
admission
hearing
that
congress
does
not
have
any
power
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
an
officer
of
this
court.
you
and
you
alone
have
the
power
to
determine
the
qualifications
and
you
and
you
alone
select
who
shall
be
your
officer.
mr.
warren
b.
king
they
cannot
for
the
plain
and
simple
reason,
your
honor
because
they
can
enact
a
law
to
support
the
oath
in
an
admission
hearing.
any
attempt
to
invade
the
province
of
this
court,
the
inherent
judicial
power
to
select
whom
you
desire
to
be
your
attorneys.
and
you
can
also
determine
for
what
cause
they
ought
to
be
punished
or
removed.
the
whole
cycle
is
complete,
you
have
the
power
the
select
whom
shall
be
your
officer
and
you
have
the
power
to
determine
for
what
cause
they
ought
to
be
removed.
therefore
it's
our
position
--
excuse
me
justice?
mr.
warren
b.
king
congress
--
that
is
correct
and
if
i
may
modify
your
statement,
it
is
correct
that
congress
did
not
do
that.
may
i
state
it
this
way,
if
congress
had
intended
to
do
as
justice
frankfurter
indicated
then
they
all
--
they
would
have
had
to
do
in
1621
is
merely
saying
this
in
any
proceeding.
authorizing
an
oath
to
--
in
any
proceeding
in
which
an
oath
maybe
administered
on
and
on.
but
they
didn't
do
that
because
you
see
it's
in
derogation
of
the
common
law.
in
common
law
and
way
back
to
the
roman
law,
we
had
a
situation
whereby
in
judicial
proceedings,
automatically
the
violation
of
an
oath
constituted
perjury.
that
was
the
common
law
and
that
was
the
roman
law.
anything
extrajudicial
was
false
lines,
so
all
down
to
history,
any
violation
of
an
oath
in
a
judicial
hearing
proceeding,
constituted
perjury.
it
was
not
necessary
then
to
have
a
law
of
the
united
states
authorizing
the
oath.
common
law
now
supports
that.
it's
not
necessary.
now
they
wish
to
go
out
into
a
second
field.
they
wish
to
move
into
another
field
in
restriction
of
the
common
law,
so
they
say
not
all
proceedings,
not
all
hearings,
the
judge
doesn't
have
a
roving
commission
to
administer
an
oath
to
the
party
hires
to
be
(inaudible).
they
say
only
in
those
cases
whereby
two
qualifications
exist.
one
that
the
proper
tribunal
officer
purchase
or
administer
the
oath
and
two,
there
must
be
a
law
of
the
united
states
or
must
be
a
clear
legislative
base
in
order
to
constitute
this
crime.
it
cannot
be
constituted
unless
there's
a
legislative
base
and
of
course
there
is
no
legislative
base
here.
mr.
warren
b.
king
completely.
mr.
warren
b.
king
that's
our
view
supported
by
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
it's
--
it's
the
argument
that
was
supported
by
at
least
three
cases
i
can
think
of,
(inaudible),
brooks
versus
laws.
mr.
warren
b.
king
and
a
new
case
in
re
schrader
which
is
found
in
22
federal
--
found
in
22
federal
cases
that
we
found
when
we
traced
down
the
citation
they
made
22
federal
cases
12.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
this
particular
case
when
we
traced
down
1654
in
this
particular
case
which
was
the
statute
that
they
tried
to
extend
over
and
say
constituted
a
law
of
the
united
states
and
tracing
back
its
history.
the
court
in
the
schrader
case
said
is
the
statute
which
was
one
statute
92,
the
forerunner
of
1654
that
they
relied
on.
in
the
schrader
case
they
said
it
is
clear
concession
to
the
courts.
that
statute
is
a
clear
concession
to
the
courts
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
of
admission
of
attorneys
to
practice
in
the
national
courts
and
maybe
taken
as
an
acknowledgement
by
congress
that
this
is
a
matter
within
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states.
mr.
warren
b.
king
i'm
saying
that
congress
has
not
attempted
to
do
so.
and
if
it
did
attempt
to
do
so,
you're
correct,
your
honor
it
would
be
a
nullity.
and
i
am
saying
because
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
they
haven't
attempted
to
do
so,
if
they
did
so,
it
would
be
a
nullity
but
that's
exclusively
to
your
jurisdiction.
and
particularly,
they
haven't
done
so
when
this
defendant
was
on
the
stand
and
required
to
take
an
oath
pursuant
to
an
administrative
action
and
investigation
into
his
fitness
so
therefore
there
is
no
legislative
phase.
now
if
i
may
call
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
you
may.
mr.
warren
b.
king
that
is
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
b.
king
at
the
time
he
made
this
statement,
there
was
no
law
of
the
united
states,
authorizing
local
rule
3
in
an
admission
hearing.
mr.
warren
b.
king
certainly.
mr.
warren
b.
king
four
days
before.
and
i
might
answer
the
other
end
of
your
question
because
it's
important.
of
course
he
had
of
moral
duty.
mr.
warren
b.
king
but
may
i
answer
the
corollary?
he
has
had
a
moral
duty
to
tell
the
court
the
truth
and
the
court
has
in
its
inherent
judicial
power
available
all
of
the
sanctions
to
punish
it
by
contempt
temporary
suspension.
disbarment
in
a
regular
procedure
where
he
would
be
tried
by
his
own,
beat
his
own
home
court
minnesota
and
the
bar
of
texas
where
he
is
admitted.
so
there
was
a
duty
and
there
were
corollary
sanctions.
now,
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
too,
the
government's
briefs
spends
four
or
five
pages
talking
about
something
that
we
will
readily
concede.
they
are
talking
about
the
first
requirements
of
the
perjury
statute,
saying
that
the
court
has
power
under
rule
459
and
the
court
under
rule
352
and
under
the
rules
of
83.
of
course
the
court
had
the
power
had
to
administer
this
oath.
of
course
it
was
a
proper
tribunal
but
our
contention
is
that
the
second
valid
requirement
that
first
before
the
crime
of
perjury
can
be
charged
against
this
man
whose
professional
life
is
at
stake,
there
must
be
a
law
of
the
united
states
authorizing
that
oath
and
here
there
is
no
law
of
the
united
states
authorizing
that
oath.
mr.
warren
b.
king
that's
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
declared
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
the
court
declared
a
rule
but
the
rule,
the
local
rule
of
court
--
that
the
court
declared
is
not
a
law
of
the
united
states
because
our
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
yes
but
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
we
say
they
cannot
in
an
admission
hearing
but
the
rule
that
they
pass,
mr.
justice
black
was
not
a
law
of
the
united
states
at
all.
it
was
a
local
rule
of
court
in
an
investigative
hearing
--
in
an
administrative
hearing
which
cannot
and
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
a
law
of
the
united
states
because
it
must
have
a
legislative
base.
do
you
remember
the
caha
case
he
cited?
mr.
warren
b.
king
we
--
we
agree
that
they
cannot
pass.
mr.
warren
b.
king
the
last
answer
to
your
question
is
correct
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
the
judge
and
his
judicial
power
could
sanction
what
he
wanted
to.
and
we
say
correctly
that
the
congress
cannot
pass
a
law
under
the
existing
1621
because
that's
the
field
it
reserved
exclusively
to
the
judiciary
to
determine
who
and
they
do
not
have
a
legislative
base.
now
may
i
go
back
to
the
caha
case
and
let's
take
the
(inaudible)
case,
let's
take
all
of
them.
what
has
happened?
there
first
was
a
statute
which
had
an
object
in
mind
only
a
160
acres
in
the
homestead
case.
and
those
statutes
then
put
there
that
agency
is
spreading
out
to
make
rules
and
regulations.
but
there
first
was
a
legislative
based
the
homestead
act,
the
selective
service
act.
and
do
you
remember
what
you
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
the
first
statute
was
that
a
manufacturer
shall
keep
books
but
a
wholesaler
didn't
and
they
charged
him
with
perjury
and
(inaudible)
the
basic
act
for
this
crime,
the
original
basic
act
for
this
crime
must
be
legislative
in
basis
and
because
the
legislature
didn't
require
the
wholesaler
keep
books,
you
and
your
regulations
can't
supply
it.
every
one
of
the
cases
they
cite
has
a
legislative
base
--
it
has
a
legislative
base,
the
homestead
act
just
like
the
(inaudible)
here,
we
do
not
have
a
legislative
base,
we
have
only
local
rule
3
which
clearly
is
not
a
legislative
base.
it's
a
local
rule
of
court
in
an
administrative
hearing
and
he
so
said
that
that
was.
now
i
might
just
add
this
one
sentence
that
comes
to
my
mind
and
that
is
with
reference
to
the
validity.
mr.
warren
b.
king
your
honor
that's
100%
correct.
may
i
offer
a
little
modification?
all
right,
sir.
congress
can
wipe
it
up
tomorrow
because
congress
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
create
a
federal
district
court
but
something
happens
as
soon
as
they
create
that
court.
as
soon
as
the
child
is
born,
it
assumes
under
itself
then
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
judicial
branch
of
the
federal
government
and
thereafter
--
and
thereafter,
congress
cannot
legislate
in
the
field
of
admissions
of
attorneys
to
practice
in
that
court
because
such
a
court
is
vested
in
such
authorities
invested
in
the
courts
only.
albeit,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
they
can
wipe
it
out
tomorrow
but
can
they
can
name
the
federal
district
judge?
mr.
warren
b.
king
it
matures
upon
birth
and
assumes
judicial
inherent
power
that
you
have
which
congress
cannot
invade
to
tell
you
who
your
officers
shall
be
and
tell
you
how
to
regulate
them
and
how
they
should
be
handled.
you
have
full
and
complete
power
to
do
that.
mr.
warren
b.
king
i
am
not
familiar.
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
iowa
bar.
mr.
warren
b.
king
i'm
a
member
of
the
minnesota
bar.
mr.
warren
b.
king
we're
admitted
in
the
state
courts
pursuant
to
the
inherent
judicial
power
of
that
court.
mr.
warren
b.
king
i
am
not
aware
of
any
that
the
courts
themselves
make
that
prescription.
and
all
--
there
could
be
--
there
could
be
probably
in
some
states.
i
might
say
this
maybe
i
can
get
in
an
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
warren
b.
king
i'm
not
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
i'm
not
familiar
with
it
but
may
i
answer
your
question
this
way.
that
it
could
be
that
in
some
state
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
warren
b.
king
no,
we
have
not.
may
i
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
qualification.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
either
but
i
might
say
this
in
direct
answer
to
your
question.
if
there
was
a
statute
putting
forth
the
minimum
requirements,
we
would
then
have
this
situation
in
nearly
all
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
country
wherein
the
question
has
arisen
that
the
act
of
admitting
applicants
to
the
bar
is
regarded
as
judicial
rather
than
legislative
in
character,
that's
144
alr.
accordingly,
nearly
all
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
matters
support
the
doctrine
of
the
determination
of
the
qualifications
of
a
particular
person
applying
permission
to
the
bar
is
exclusively
a
judicial
function.
so
even
if
they
did,
and
the
question
happened
to
come
head
on
the
judiciary
in
my
opinion
would
win.
and
that
is
why
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
i
would
assume
so,
your
honor
and
this
is
not
properly
so.
that's
why
in
a
question
of
validity
that
you
raised
a
moment
ago,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
in
putting
the
test
as
to
whether
local
rule
3
is
a
law
of
the
united
states.
you
would
have
a
right
perhaps
to
determine
as
impliedly
within
that
question
of
whether
or
not
that's
ex
post
facto
and
as
to
whether
or
not
its
discriminatory
because
it
applies
only
to
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
state
lawyers
just
to
plaintiffs
and
not
the
defendants
because
it's
not
universal
at
all,
because
it's
highly
discriminatory,
because
the
judge
may
put
the
man
under
oath.
and
he
also,
if
you
please,
has
the
right
to
put
the
party
under
oath.
he
can
call
a
party
down
and
say,
"when
did
you
meet
you
this
man."
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
he
can
take
the
next
man
who
is
an
out-of-state
attorney
and
say,
"i'll
waive
the
oath.”
and
you
admit
it.
i
like
you,
you're
a
fine
fellow.
that's
what
rule
3
is.
so
insofar
as
you
put
the
test
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
law
of
the
united
states,
you
could
determine
whether
it
would
meet
the
common
test
of
a
law
of
the
united
states
because
rule
3
is
not
a
law
of
the
united
states.
and
further
because
the
common
law
in
--
other
than
a
judicial
proceeding
is
not
a
law
of
the
united
states.
we
sincerely
believe
in
trust
that
you
will
agree
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed
because
nowhere
in
the
government's
brief
have
they
satisfied
the
second
requirement
that
there
is
any
law
of
the
united
states
which
in
any
manner
authorized
the
oath
that
mr.
hvass
took.
and
in
absence
of
any
judicial,
in
absence
of
any
legislative
base
and
we
say
there
couldn't
be
any
legislative
base
that
this
man
is
not
subjective
to
the
charge
of
perjury.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
attorney's
relationship
with
a
federal
court,
stems
from
the
inherent
judicial
power
and
consequently
any
attorney
who
is
guilty
of
any
unethical
conduct
in
an
admission
hearing.
he
is
although
not
guilty
of
perjury
he
is
certainly
has
subject
to
all
the
inherent
powers
of
the
court
to
punish
such
misconduct.
but
that
it
was
never
intended
that
in
an
extra
judicial
hearing
that
it
would
support
the
charge
of
perjury.
you
remembered
in
the
george
case
it
said
an
affidavit
not
authorized
or
required
by
a
law
of
the
united
states
will
not
support
the
crime
of
perjury.
and
we
cited
the
larson
case
which
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
that's
the
united
states
versus
george
that's
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
b.
king
well,
i
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
it
was
--
it
would
be
part
of
it.
it
would
be
part
of
this,
your
honor.
well,
i
think
you
could
be
correct
in
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
you
are
so
correct
and
we
agree.
but
we
have
a
larson
case
which
we
think
is
cited
and
it
came
from
minnesota
which
is
so
similar
because
there,
a
man
have
been
found
guilty
of
a
crime.
and
after
the
main
action
was
over,
the
judge
brought
him
in
and
put
him
under
oath
and
asked
him
some
questions
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
or
not
he
should
--
what
type
of
sentence
he
should
have.
and
the
court
there
affirmed
the
law,
laid
down
in
the
united
states
versus
george
by
saying
that,
"that
oath
was
not
supported
by
any
statutory
provision
in
the
state
of
minnesota
and
therefore
would
not
support
the
charge
of
perjury."
and
because
it
wouldn't
support
the
charge
of
perjury
because
there
was
no
legislative
base,
the
crime
had
not
been
committed.
it's
so
very,
very
similar
to
the
case
that
we
have
here
and
in
that
case
the
larson
--
state
versus
larson
they
cited
the
george
case.
mr.
warren
b.
king
yes,
i
do.
mr.
warren
b.
king
the
distinction
is
this,
your
honor.
in
mr.
spritzer's
case,
there
was
a
clear
legislative
base
that
was
the
homestead
act
by
congress
flowing
from
that
and
within
the
framework
of
that
original
statutory
authority,
the
land
office
was
created
and
the
land
office
was
delegated
rules,
power
to
make
rules
to
carry
out.
the
effect
of
the
land
office
at
the
homestead
act
to
see
that
nobody
got
more
than
160
acres.
so
they
had
a
right,
a
perfect
right
to
make
a
regulation
and
require
an
oath
because
it
was
bottomed
upon
legislative
authority,
a
clear
legislative
base.
the
oath
carried
out
the
purpose
so
nobody
could
get
more
than
160
acres
and
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
it.
in
this
case,
the
legislature
didn't
say
anything
about
putting
a
man
under
oath
after
the
trial
was
all
over.
in
our
case,
congress
is
never
given
any
authority
at
all
to
administer
the
oath
to
the
defendant.
not
any
authority
whatsoever
that
they
did
would
be
a
nullity.
the
cases
are
so
different
because
here
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
100%
your
honor
and
therefore
there
is
no
legislative
base
to
say
it
in
so
many
words
in
the
case
that
the
government
cited
there
was
a
legislative
base
and
here
there
is
no
legislative
base.
we're
here
left
the
way
we
are
found.
we're
found
with
a
man
who
is
practicing
law
in
that
federal
court
because
the
court
said
that
he
could.
and
if
there
is
to
be
any
punishment
for
misconduct,
if
he
was
guilty,
the
court
has
ample
power
to
punish
him.
he
shall
not
be
charged
with
the
crime
and
forfeit.
his
entire
professional
life
but
it
can
go
back
to
the
bar
association
not
in
a
foreign
court
before
a
foreign
judge
and
a
foreign
jury
but
go
back
to
the
bar
association
where
they
know
the
man.
they
understand
what
the
charge
was.
if
the
charge
is
solicitation,
they
understand
what
it
means
in
the
state.
they
understand
how
it's
been
defined
by
that
state
and
not
by
the
state
of
iowa.
and
then
he
is
presented
with
a
bill
of
particulars.
he
hasn't
called
down
by
an
order
three
days
before,
three
days
after
a
new
rule
is
put
into
effect
and
said,
"tell
us
all
about
your
prior
life,
your
prior
professional
life,
years
before
you
ever
had
these
cases
and
we
will
determine
for
ourselves
whether
or
not
that
is
competent,
whether
or
not
that
is
proper."
that
is
far
different
in
being
presented
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
different
but
you
must
remember
that
the
court
satisfied
the
law,
the
court
said,
"thou
shalt
not
try
these
cases."
and
he
didn't
but
they
didn't'
stopped
there.
the
rule
was
to
determine
his
fitness
to
try
one
particular,
two
particular
cases.
they
said,
"we
don't
think
you're
fit."
and
after
they
said
that
they
didn't
stop
they
wanted
to
go
one
step
further
and
put
--
charge
him
with
a
federal
crime
which
was
not
authored
--
the
oath
was
not
authorized
by
a
law
of
the
united
states
to
deprive
him
of
his
professional
livelihood
in
all
of
the
other
states
where
he
is
admitted
to
practice
law.
that's
quite
a
serious
charge.
the
rule
had
been
satisfied.
the
rule
says,
"permission
to
try
a
particular
case."
they
said,
"you
don't
fill
our
qualifications.
we
won't
let
you
try
it."
but
they
didn't
stop
there.
months
afterwards
they
put
in
an
indictment.
mr.
warren
b.
king
that
would
be
the
--
that
would
be
the
report
of
our
contention.
mr.
warren
b.
king
not
in
so
many
words,
your
honor.
we
just
said
that
doesn't
have
a
legislative
--
we
argued
in
the
inference
that
it
doesn't
have
a
legislative
base
--
we
argued
in
the
contrary,
it
is
not
a
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
warren
b.
king
we
do
put
our
eggs
in
the
basket
that
there
was
no
law
in
the
united
states
authorizing
the
oath.
it
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
--
wasn't
rule
3
and
there
wasn't
any
statute
and
there
isn't
any
rule.
mr.
warren
b.
king
no
valid
--
mr.
warren
b.
king
i
don't
believe
so
only
insofar
as
you
determine
whether
or
not
the
rule
satisfies
the
requirement
of
a
law
of
the
united
states
and
if
you
say
it
is
not
a
law
of
the
united
states
because
it's
invalid
and
so
on.
only
insofar
as
that,
per
se
the
validity
of
the
rule,
i'm
afraid
you
do
not.
mr.
warren
b.
king
that
seems
to
be
the
law,
your
honor.
we
did
raise
it
below
and
it
was
raised
part
of
the
case
too.
