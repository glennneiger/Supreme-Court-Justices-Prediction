mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
pursuant
to
the
criminal
appeals
act
from
a
judgment
of
the
northern
--
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
court
of
iowa
which
dismissed
an
indictment
for
perjury.
this
court
has
postponed
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction
to
this
hearing
on
the
merits.
before
getting
to
that
threshold
jurisdictional
issue,
it
is
of
course
necessary
to
state
the
essential
facts
and
particularly
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
decision.
mr.
hvass,
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
an
attorney,
a
member
of
the
minnesota
bar.
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
iowa
bar
or
of
the
federal
district
court
bar
in
iowa.
he
wished
to
participate
in
two
unrelated
personal
injury
actions,
both
of
them
pending
in
the
northern
district
of
iowa
as
attorney
for
the
respective
plaintiffs
on
those
cases.
like
most
district
courts,
iowa
has
local
rules
relating
to
the
admission
of
attorneys
who
are
not
members
of
the
local
bar.
the
applicable
rule
in
this
case
is
called
local
rule
3
and
it
is
set
forth
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief.
the
first
paragraph
of
that
rule,
the
court
will
note,
contains
provisions
which
are
fairly
common.
for
example,
the
out-of-state
attorney
must
associate
with
himself
a
resident
attorney
for
purposes
of
receiving
process
and
the
like.
and
it
has
a
provision
that
the
court
may
call
for
a
showing
of
satisfactory
moral
character.
the
second
paragraph
which
is
more
particularly
involved
here,
relates
to
a
special
category
of
cases
to
personal
injury
cases
in
which
the
out-of-state
attorney
whishes
to
represent
an
iowa
claimant
who
has
suffered
injury
in
iowa.
now,
as
to
this
category
of
actions,
the
court
has
imposed
by
its
rule
more
detailed,
fuller
requirements.
that
second
paragraph
provides
that
the
court
may
require
the
out-of-state
attorney
to
show
and
i
quote
here
from
the
rule,
that
the
connection
of
the
said
attorney
with
the
case
was
not
occasioned
or
brought
about
in
violation
of
the
standards
of
conduct
specified
in
rule
8
here.
now
rule
8
to
interpolate
adopts
for
the
district
court
in
iowa
the
provisions
of
the
canons
of
professional
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association.
so
the
apparent
purpose
of
this
second
paragraph
of
the
rule
in
a
nutshell
is
to
enable
the
court
to
deal
effectively
and
promptly
at
the
very
outset
of
a
litigation
with
any
possible
instance
of
ambulance
chasing
by
an
attorney
seeking,
believed
to
participate
in
a
case
in
that
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
isn't
a
--
this
happened
to
have
been
fela
cases.
so
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
rule
would
apply
equally
in
a
diversity
situation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
the
rule
is
not
restricted,
your
honor
to
either
category.
this
brings
me
to
the
last
sentence
of
the
rule
which
is
particularly
important
here.
the
court
and
i'm
reading
from
the
rule
at
page
3,
“as
a
part
of
said
showing
may
require
the
plaintiff
and
the
said
attorney
to
appear
and
be
examined
under
oath."
pursuant
to
this
rule,
mr.
hvass
sought
leave
of
the
court
to
participate
in
the
two
personal
injury
cases
to
which
i
previously
adverted.
the
court
then
acting
on
its
own
motion
set
his
application
down
for
a
hearing.
it
also
directed
the
united
states
attorney
as
an
officer
of
the
court
to
make
an
inquiry
and
to
present
to
the
court
any
relevant
facts
bearing
on
the
application.
hearings
were
thereafter
duly
held.
mr.
hvass
at
that
hearing
or
those
hearings
testified
under
oath.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
opinion
suggests
that
it
was
and
i
think
there
is
no
issue
that
in
fact
that
was
the
case.
the
court
does
not
have
before
it
as
part
of
the
record
here,
the
full
transcript
of
the
hearing
because
as
i
shall
elaborate
this
case
comes
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
second
paragraph
of
the
rule
went
into
effect
only
a
short
time
before
this
application
was
filed
and
hence
there
had
been
at
that
point
no
regular
practice.
i
can
say
to
the
court
that
at
the
same
time
that
mr.
hvass'
application
for
leave
to
participate
was
heard.
there
was
a
hearing
involving
another
attorney
who
sought
leave
to
participate
in
another
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
sole
question
is
as
to
the
reach
of
the
federal
perjury
statute.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'd
say
it's
not
an
issue,
your
honor
for
this
reason.
the
district
court
holding
is
not
that
this
is
an
invalid
rule.
the
district
court
did
not
doubt
that
it
was
within
the
district
court's
rule
making
power
to
prescribe
the
criteria
for
admission
of
attorneys
who
wished
--
leave
to
participate.
what
the
district
court
held
was
assuming
the
rule
is
valid,
is
this
the
kind
of
rule
to
which
the
federal
perjury
statute
has
application?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct.
he
said
--
in
this
sense
only,
your
honor.
he
said
it's
not
a
law
of
the
united
states
in
the
sense
that
that
term
is
used
in
the
perjury
statute.
he
did
not
indicate
that
he
thought
the
rule
was
invalid
or
unauthorized.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
before,
your
honor.
the
rule
was
in
effect
before
this
hearing
took
place.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
suit
had
been
filed
before
the
rule
and
the
application
was
filed
after
the
rule.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
was
four
months
here,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
a
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
of
united
states.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
the
only
question
here
because
i
think
that
is
the
only
question
that
was
decided
by
the
district
court
and
i
think
it's
the
only
question
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
accordingly
which
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
decide.
i
had
adverted
to
the
hearings
to
the
fact
that
mr.
hvass
testified.
there
was
also
a
testimony
by
various
other
witnesses.
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearings,
judge
graven
who
is
the
presiding
judge
of
the
northern
district
of
iowa,
denied
mr.
hvass'
application
for
leave
to
participate
in
the
two
cases.
some
months
thereafter
a
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
for
perjury
which
charged
that
various
statements
made
by
mr.
hvass
in
his
sworn
testimony,
statements
which
denied
solicitation,
maintenance
and
champerty
were
false.
the
day
after
the
indictment
was
returned,
judge
graven
removed
himself
from
all
further
proceedings
in
the
perjury
case
presumably
because
he
had
formed
or
at
least
might
be
thought
to
have
informed
an
opinion
as
to
mr.
hvass'
credibility
by
virtue
of
having
presided
at
this
qualification
hearings.
and
he
designated
judge
mickelson,
a
visiting
judge
from
south
dakota
to
handle
all
further
proceedings
in
the
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
is
the
presiding
judge
of
the
district.
in
fact,
he
is
the
only
judge
in
that
district.
and
the
order
indicates
that
it
was
by
the
district
judge,
the
assignment.so
let
me
refer
to
the
docket
entry
if
i
may.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
know
that
it
was
in
the
form
of
an
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
a
court
order.
the
docket
entry
appears
at
record
12.
it
does
not
state
who
entered
the
order.
counsel
for
appellee
informs
me
that
it
was
by
the
chief
judge
of
the
circuit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
--
yes.
i
think
that's
correct.
our
record
does
not
give
the
order
itself
but
merely
a
docket
entry.
now,
the
basis
of
the
dismissal
is
summed
up
in
this
case
by
a
single
sentence
of
the
district
judge's
opinion.
he
himself
undertook
to
state
in
a
sentence
what
he
was
holding.
at
record
10,
he
stated
and
i
quote,
“i
simply
hold,"
--
i'm
reading
toward
the
bottom
of
that
page,
next
to
the
last
paragraph.
“i
simply
hold
that
rule
3
under
which
the
defendant
took
his
oath
is
not
such
a
law
of
the
united
states
as
was
intended
by
congress
to
support
an
indictment
for
perjury."
now,
we
say
to
begin
with
that
such
a
decision
plainly
rests
upon
an
interpretation
whether
that
interpretation
be
right
or
wrong
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
is
found.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
itself,
your
honor,
yes.
he
confines
himself
solely
to
the
proposition
that
this
kind
of
a
rule
wasn't
encompassed
by
the
federal
perjury
statute.
now,
if
that
so
as
we
think
the
opinion
requires
one
to
conclude,
the
case
is
plainly
one
without
more
which
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
on
direct
appeal
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
assume
that
any
other
defenses
maybe
raised
in
the
district
court,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
only
question
here
and
the
only
question
which
the
court
could
ask
upon
is
the
question
of
the
correctness
of
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
perjury
statute
by
judge
mickelson.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
if
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
passed
upon
more
than
raised.
i
think
it
has
to
be
decided.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
sir.
i
don't
think,
your
honors
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
if
they
were
an
independent
basis
of
decision.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
think
in
the
--
in
the
borden
case
in
308
united
states.
this
court
indicated
that
it
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
only
of
the
issue
of
construction
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
was
founded
and
that
is
in
fact,
there
had
been
another
basis
of
decision
by
the
district
court.
the
case
would
have
had
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
directly
here.
now
on
the
merits,
the
question
of
course
is
whether
judge
mickelson's
interpretation
of
the
perjury
statute
is
a
permissible
one.
we
say
that
there
is
no
sound
reason
even
if
one
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate
here
and
one
is
not,
for
holding
the
perjury
statute
to
be
restricted
to
proceedings
which
are
conducted
pursuant
to
a
legislative
act
as
this
court
had
occasion
to
note
in
the
ludenia
howard
case
on
the
last
term.
the
case
not
involving
perjury
to
be
sure
but
the
federal
black
bass
act,
a
rule
or
regulation
may
constitute
a
law
within
the
meaning
of
a
statute.
there,
a
regulation
of
the
florida
game
commission
was
deemed
to
be
a
law
of
the
state
of
florida
for
purposes
of
applying
a
federal
statute.
and
so
far
as
the
federal
perjury
statute
itself
is
concerned,
this
court
decided
as
long
ago
as
caha
against
united
states,
a
case
that's
decided
in
1894.
that
one
may
commit
perjury
when
the
oath
is
administered
pursuant
to
a
valid
administrative
regulation
and
that
was
the
case
this,
as
the
court
will
recall,
which
arose
under
one
of
the
homestead
act.
the
homestead
act
had
given
a
broad
authority
to
the
land
department
as
it
was
then
called
to
adopt
procedures
to
settle
disputed
claims
as
to
land
and
the
land
department
had
proceeded
to
adopt
a
scheme
of
regulations,
rules
of
practice
for
disposing
of
context
questions
as
to
who
among
various
claimants
had
made
the
valid
homestead
entry.
and
mr.
caha
was
a
claimant
in
such
a
case
heard
before
a
local
land
officer.
the
land
officer
got
his
powers
only
pursuant
to
an
administrative
regulation.
he
was
indicted
for
having
given
false
testimony
during
the
course
of
that
proceeding
before
the
local
land
officer
and
he
challenged
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
act
of
congress
did
not
provide
for
the
administration
of
an
oath.
and
this
court
unanimously
sustained
the
indictment.
it
held
the
regulation
was
valid
as
within
the
broad
delegation
of
the
statute
and
it
held
further
that
since
the
local
land
officer,
acting
under
a
valid
regulation,
constituted
a
competent
tribunal,
the
perjury
statute
heretofore
supply.
of
course
the
--
the
test
under
the
perjury
statute
which
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
the
test
for
present
purposes
is
whether
a
law
of
the
united
states
authorized
an
oath
to
be
administered.
now
we
take
it
that
there
can
be
no
serious
question
that
a
rule
of
court
within
the
rule
making
authority
of
the
district
court
stands
on
a
footing
which
is
not
inferior
to
an
administrative
regulation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
there
would
be
no
significant
difference.
i
think
that
so
long
as
the
rule
is
one
which
falls
within
the
realm
of
the
court's
business
but
then
the
court
may
administer
an
oath.
certainly
judges
and
clerks
of
court
have
power
to
administer
oath
than
to
take
acknowledgements.
that
power
we
think
extends
to
all
cases
to
which
the
judicial
power
extends.
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
the
general
power
of
a
court
to
administer
an
oath,
the
rule
itself
explicitly
provided
for
that
procedure.
in
short,
we
believe
that
the
broad
language
of
the
perjury
statute
does
not
admit
of
any
exception
for
proceedings
which
are
conducted
pursuant
to
rule
of
court
or
pursuant
to
administrative
rule.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
--
i
do,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
here,
we're
talking
about
case
or
controversy
in
the
--
in
any
constitutional
sense.
certainly,
we
have
a
wide
variety
of
decisions
in
which
perjury
indictments
had
been
sustained
arising
out
of
all
kinds
of
administrative
matters
in
the
proceedings.
matters
like
filing
of
a
tax
return,
a
false
statement
in
an
application
for
a
pension,
a
false
statement
by
a
selective
service
registrant,
a
false
statement
by
a
surety
on
a
bail
bond
before
the
united
states
commissioner.
indeed
this
court
in
novak
against
united
states
had
a
perjury
case
which
involved
false
statements
in
a
verified
tax
return.
so
i
think
that
the
statute
covers
any
type
of
proceeding
so
long
as
the
administration
of
the
oath
in
that
proceeding
is
authorized
ultimately
by
federal
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
or
in
any
matter,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i
think
one
is
compelled
to
that
reading
by
many
decades
of
decision
involving
as
i
say
a
great
variety
of
cases
in
which
the
matter
came
up
out
of
the
course
of
administrative
proceedings
which
did
not
involve
an
adjudicatory
matter.
it
might
be
a
mere
filing
of
a
report
by
a
business
organization
with
--
with
a
regulatory
commission.
such
matters
are
brought
to
the
perjury
statute
in
play.
so
i
think
our
question
in
all
of
these
cases
is
simply
whether
a
law
of
the
united
states
authorized
and
oath
to
be
administered
and
on
that
basis,
we
see
no
possible
exception
for
this
case
from
the
rule
of
this
court
which
is
i
say
dates
back
to
the
caha
decision.
