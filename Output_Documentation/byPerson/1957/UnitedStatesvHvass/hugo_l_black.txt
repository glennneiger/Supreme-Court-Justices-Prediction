justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it
not
an
issue
if
this
is
not
authorized
by
law,
it
wouldn't
be
a
hearing
that
was
lawfully
authorized.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
held,
isn't
it,
that
it
was
not
a
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
rule
adopted
before
or
after
this
lawyer
filed
these
lawsuits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
hearing,
before
the
lawyer
filed
a
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
adopted
the
rule,
how
long
after
this
lawsuit
has
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
leave
the
validity
of
a
law
still
open.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
at
this
type
of
case,
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
rely
on
any
grounds
for
affirmance
which
the
record
shows
and
to
wit
that
the
statute
is
not
--
the
rule
is
invalid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
have
to
be
raised
in
the
lower
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
not
affirm
here
on
that
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
one
could
decide
when
you
have
to
say
that
the
courts
and
not
the
congress
have
the
exclusive
balance
in
regulating
the
lawyers
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
argument
you've
made
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
remember
those
types
of
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
attacking
this
on
the
basis
that
this
is
a
regulation
for
any
basis
of
(inaudible)
merits
of
structure
that
the
statute
does.
you're
saying
that
it's
bad
because
it's
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
pass
a
law
which
regulates
admission
to
the
bar.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
not
attempt
to
do
so.
i
can
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument
because
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
the
only
law
that
could
be
declared
at
all
has
to
be
declared
by
the
court.
here,
the
court
declared
a
law,
a
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
if
that's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
argument
the
he
hasn't
violated
the
--
that
they
didn't'
have
a
right
to
do
it
under
this
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
anybody
else
can
pass
on
but
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
congress
pass
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
legislative
base
and
congress
has
no
power
to
pass
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
now
the
attorneys
get
admitted
on
the
state
legislative
act?how
did
he
get
admitted
to
practice
from
the
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
bar
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
minnesota,
how
lawyers
admitted
to
practice,
under
legislative
act
in
the
state
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
statute
which
prescribes
certain
qualifications
for
admission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
now
that
in
minnesota
there's
no
statute
of
any
kind
to
subscribe
any
qualifications,
the
lawyers
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
know
there
was
one
like
you,
maybe
there
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
judiciary
were
decided
favorably
judiciarys?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
distinguish
or
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
that
case
and
the
one
that
mr.
spritzer
cited?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
distinction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
return
back
to
your
distinction
then
to
the
ground
that
the
courts
have
the
exclusive
power
to
decide
all
the
qualifications
of
lawyers,
anything
congress
does
is
nullity.
