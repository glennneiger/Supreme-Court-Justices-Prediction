mr.
king,
have
you
in
your
briefs
argued
that
--
that
if
the
court
should
find
that
there
was
a
legislative
base
for
this
rule,
that
still
the
rule
itself
invalid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
did
you
argue
that?
chief

validity
of
that
particular
rule?
chief

yes.
well
that
--
that
--
you
say
that
you
raised
that
according
to
the
law
and
didn't
decide
it
on
that
and
we
do
not
have
a
right
to
decide
it
here
because
of
the
limited
review
we
can
make
in
this
matter
of
case.
