justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
case
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
before
the
act
which
required
that
the
each
mode
of
transportation
be
given
its
inherent
advantages
by
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
this
court
ever
held
that
that's
not
a
--
that
either
a
barge
line
or
motor
carrier
or
railroad
can
be
denied
the
right
to
operate
on
the
basis
that
in
view
it
has
the
capacity
to
carry
cheaper
than
the
other
types
of
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
referring
to
any
case,
i
just
wanted
to
know,
i'm
not
familiar
whether
any
time
this
court
has
ever
said
that
if
one
of
the
three
types
of
services
could
carry
cheaper
than
another,
it's
to
be
denied
the
right
to
carry
because
of
that
ability
to
carry
cheaper
than
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
meant
by
the
commission's
statement
is
well
established
is
this,
that
is
trying
to
get
lower
rates
is
not
a
proper
basis
for
grant
of
authority.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
was
one
of
the
object
of
the
act,
was
to
give
public
the
benefit
of
cheaper
rates
as
advancing
knowledge
of
mechanics
and
improved
methods
of
transportation,
makes
old
methods
obsolete
under
certain
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
has
that
--
did
they
make
a
finding
to
that
objective,
is
that
what
they
based
this
on,
i
can
understand
that
if
they've
done
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
say
that
the
commission
based
its
finding
here
on
the
facts
that
the
railroads
can
carry
the
cheap
or
cheaper
than
the
other,
then
i
can
understand
it,
but
if
you
are
going
on
the
basis
that
commission
has
a
right,
despite
that,
to
say
public
is
not
entitled
to
cheaper
method
of
transportation
on
one
of
those
three
types,
then
i
do
not
understand
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
so
read
it
on
that
page
37.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
throw
it
all
out
because
they
say
they
want
it
cheaper,
that's
most
--
they
don't
want
to
get
that
stuff
as
cheaper
as
it
could
be
done
by
any
motor
transportation,
if
that's
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
if
you
are
going
on
the
basis
that
--
one
basis
that,
that
basis
is
one
thing,
you
point
out
to
me
where
they
have
found
that
they
did
not
put
this
no
the
theory
and
on
the
premise
precisely
as
they
did
on
page
37,
that
they
won't
grant
this
motor
carrier
because
the
only
reason
they
could
do
it
because
it
carries
cheaper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
railroad
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
bill
contemplates
doesn't
it,
that
there
shall
be
three
types
of
service,
where
it
can
be
and
the
congress
itself
settled
the
problem
didn't
it
as
to
whether
the
public
would
be
entitled
to
have
those
types
of
service
when
it
passed
that
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
troubled
with
that
premise
(inaudible)
if
you
say
that
they
had
disclosed
the
need
for
this
service
because
they
were
getting
railroad
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
when
the
act
was
passed
it
went
on
the
assumption
there
was
a
need
for
both
kinds
of
service
and
that
the
congress
was
providing
both
kinds
of
service
and
borrowing
service
where
they
could
be
carried
without
considering
or
considering
is
crucial
at
all,
in
fact
it
might
compete
with
one
of
the
other
lines
of
service
and
it
is
decided
thing
they
wanted
was
to
get
it
as
cheap
as
they
could
by
their
particular
type
of
transportation
which
could
do
it
the
cheapest,
that's
my
understanding
of
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
could
understand
that
thoroughly
if
that's
what
the
commission
based
its
ruling
on,
i
could
go
with
you
on
that.
