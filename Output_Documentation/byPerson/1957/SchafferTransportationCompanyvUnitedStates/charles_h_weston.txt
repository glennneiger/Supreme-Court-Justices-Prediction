mr.
charles
h.
weston
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
believes
that
the
commission's
action
in
denying
schaffer's
application
rests
on
a
misconstruction
of
the
applicable
statutory
provisions.
i
would
try
to
bring
out
the
considerations
which
we
think
decides
these.
mr.
beardsley
has
referred
to
most
of
them
but
my
emphasis
maybe
slightly
different
and
i
hope
to
supplement
what
he
has
said.
the
principal
point
made
in
the
commission's
brief
is
that
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
ultimate
finding
that
schaffer's
proposed
service
is
not
required
by
public
convenience
and
necessity.
as
we
see
it,
the
appeal
does
not
present
this
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
the
grounds
upon
which
the
commission
rejected
the
application
and
made
this
ultimate
finding
are
valid
grounds
under
the
statute.
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
and
not
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
schaffer's
application
was
made
under
section
207
of
the
act
and
commission
has
directed
to
grant
motor
carrier
applications
which
have
been
--
certain
other
provision
are
required
by
public
convenience
and
necessity.
the
commission's
brief
and
that
of
the
railroad
appellee
stress
that
the
commission
has
wide
discretion
in
weighting
the
factors
which
enter
into
public
convenience
and
necessity.
we
do
not
dispute
this
wide
discretion,
but
in
this
case
the
commission
pinpointed
the
grounds
upon
which
it
acted.
the
question
is
whether
these
grounds
are
permissible
under
the
statute.
this
mr.
beardsley
said
and
i
wish
to
repeat
that
the
commission
gave
only
two
grounds
for
denying
the
application.
i
will
take
up
first
the
ground
that
the
existing
railroad
service
is
adequate.
now
the
national
transportation
policy,
i
repeat,
is
--
embodies
the
direction
to
the
commission
that
it
administer
all
provisions
of
the
act
so
as
to
preserve
and
recognize
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
of
three
regulated
forms
of
transportation,
that
is
water,
motor
and
rail.
section
207,
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
test,
the
section
207
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
this
statutory
command.
the
advantages
which
inhere
in
rail
transportation
rarely
if
ever
coincide
with
the
advantages
which
inhere
in
motor
transportation.
and
the
commission
must
administer
sections
207
so
as
to
give
shippers
the
opportunities
so
far
as
feasible
of
making
a
choice
between
these
competing
forms
of
transportation
and
thereby
a
choice
between
the
advantages
which
either
one
or
the
other
may
give.
certainly
where
there
is
only
rail
service
available
as
here
an
application
for
motor
carrier
authority
is
presumptively
in
the
public
interest
by
the
very
circumstance
that
this
varying
different
form
of
transportation
is
not
presently
available
and
is
in
the
public
interest
and
necessity
absent
some
for
countervailing
consideration.
it
is
irrelevant
in
these
circumstances
that
the
railroads
are
physically
equipped
to
transport
all
the
traffic
tended
to
them
and
that
the
service
is
adequate
in
this
sense
to
deny
schaffer's
application
because
the
railroads
were
able
to
transport
or
handle
all
the
traffic
amounts
to
refusal
to
recognize
the
advantages
which
would
inhere
in
the
different
form
of
transportation
which
he
was
proposed
to
furnish.
it
protects
the
railroads
in
the
monopoly
which
they
now
have
and
it
preserves
whatever
disadvantages
inhere
in
that
form
of
transportation.
now
of
course
on
a
clear
showing,
the
grant
of
a
requested
motor
carrier
certificate
would
infringe
some
other
aspect
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
the
commission
would
be
required
to
balance
the
elements
of
that
policy
which
seem
to
point
in
different
directions,
but
in
the
present
case
the
commission
did
not
find
that
grant
of
schaffer's
application
that
was
run
counter
to
any
another
aspect
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
on
the
evidence
it
could
not
have
made
such
a
finding.
the
other
ground
upon
which
the
commission
rejected
the
application
was
that
the
shippers
who
supported
it
were
mainly
concerned
in
obtaining
lower
rates
rather
than
improved
service.
commission
did
not
find
that
shippers'
sole
purpose
was
rate
reduction.
it
could
not
have
found
this
in
view
of
its
finding
that
all
shipper
witnesses
complained
that
rail
service
is
too
slow,
and
it
is
additional
finding
that
shippers
proposed
service
would
be
more
expeditious
than
rail
less
than
carload
service
and
even
faster
as
compared
with
rail
pool
car
shipments.
improved
service
does
not
cease
to
be
a
matter
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
because
it
is
coupled
with
the
advantage
of
lower
cost
service.
the
second
advantage
does
not
cancel
out
first,
but
we
think
that
the
error
of
the
commission
is
deeper
than
this.
it
was
error
for
it
to
eliminate
as
a
factor
in
public
convenience
and
necessity,
the
fact
that
schaffer
might
be
able
to
furnish
transportation
at
rates
lower
than
those
which
the
railroads
maintain.
now
the
rationale
of
the
commission's
rulings
that
it
is
unwilling
to
consider
lower
rates
as
a
fact
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
certificate
applications
under
section
207
is
that
if
the
existing
rates
are
too
high,
it
has
power
to
reduce
them.
this
rationale
to
my
mind
is
not
very
convincing.
if
the
grantee,
if
the
motor
carrier
is
given
operating
authority
and
he
puts
in
(inaudible)
unreasonably
low
rates,
the
commission
is
equally
empowered
to
raise
those
rates.
if
form
of
service
which
he
provides
results
in
operating
economies
so
it
is
possible
to
perform
the
service
of
lower
cost
than
that
--
than
the
cost
of
the
railroads,
the
public
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
lower
rates
made
possible
by
the
lower
operating
cost.
the
national
transportation
policy
directs
commission
to
promote
economical
service.
in
a
regulated
industry
such
as
the
transportation
industry,
the
commission
perhaps
may
look
with
disfavor
on
rate
competition
as
between
railroad
and
railroad
or
as
between
motor
carrier
and
motor
carrier
but
the
considerations
are
different
where
there
is
only
rail
service
available
where
they
have
a
monopoly
of
particular
transportation
and
a
motor
carrier
seeks
to
enter
the
field,
that
motor
carrier
if,
as
in
the
case
of
this
one,
offers
a
specialized
service
for
particular
class
of
shippers,
may
well
be
able
to
provide
that
at
a
lower
cost
than
the
railroads
which
necessarily
must
conduct
their
operation
so
as
to
provide
service
for
goods
and
commodities
of
all
kinds.
and
if
this
is
so,
this
is
an
advantage
inherent
in
the
fact
that
this
is
--
motor
service
is
distinguished
from
rail
service
and
it
is
one
which
the
commission
is
commanded
to
recognize
and
preserve.
we
therefore
think
that
in
circumstances
of
this
case
the
commission
plainly
erred
when
it
denied
schaffer's
application
upon
the
ground
that
the
shippers
were
mainly
motivated
by
the
desire
for
lower
rates.
i
will
just
mention
that
the
commission's
brief
cites
a
number
of
commission
rulings
for
the
proposition
that
proposed
lower
rates
are
not
a
proper
consideration
in
section
207
certificate
applications.
we
think
it
is
significant
as
pointed
out
both
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
brief
by
the
appellants,
their
reply
brief,
i
think
with
one
exception
these
rulings
all
involved
cases
of
a
motor
carrier
application
asking
to
provide,
i
believe
to
provide
service
for
schaffer's,
already
served
by
motor
carriers.
in
other
words,
it's
not
the
case
where
a
motor
carrier
was
seeking
to
come
into
a
field
exclusively
occupied
by
the
railroads.
thank
you.
