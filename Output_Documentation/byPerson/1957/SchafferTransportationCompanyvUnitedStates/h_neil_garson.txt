mr.
h.
neil
garson
may
it
please
the
court.
pursuant
to
section
207
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
commission
in
its
discretion
is
authorized
to
grant
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
qualified
applicants
desiring
to
conduct
operations
as
common
carriers
by
motor
vehicles
in
interstate
commerce.
appellant
a
w.
schaffer
of
revillo,
south
dakota,
doing
business
as
schaffer
transportation
company,
applied
to
the
commission
under
section
207(a)
for
such
a
certificate
to
authorize
the
transportation
of
granite
which
is
to
be
used
primarily
for
tombstones
and
grave
markers
from
points
in
grant
county,
south
dakota
to
points
in
ten
states
in
the
east
and
south
including
the
district
of
columbia
and
from
points
in
vermont
to
points
of
16
states
in
the
west
and
the
south.
however,
before
the
commission
can
grant
a
certificate
to
an
applicant,
section
207(a)
requires
that
the
commission
find
one
that
the
applicant
is
fit,
willing
and
enable
properly
to
perform
the
proposed
service
and
two
that
the
proposed
service
to
the
extent
authorized
is
required
by
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
in
order
to
determine
these
matters,
the
commission
set
the
matter
down
by
hearing
at
which
time
all
parties
were
given
full
opportunity
to
adduce
evidence
in
support
or
against
the
proposed
service.
in
due
time
the
entire
matter
came
on
for
final
consideration
by
the
entire
commission
which
ultimately
concluded
in
its
report
of
december
7th,
1955,
“that
applicant
has
failed
to
establish
that
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
the
proposed
operation
and
that
the
application
should
be
denied.”
this
ultimate
finding
was
based
upon
substantial
evidence
of
record,
which
is
reflected
in
the
thorough
analysis
of
the
evidence
and
the
subsidiary
findings
found
in
the
report
of
the
commission.
these
subsidiary
findings
include
findings
based
upon
the
evidence
as
adduced
by
the
applicants,
the
supporting
shippers,
and
the
protesting
carriers.
after
making
its
subsidiary
findings
the
commission
concluded
that
on
the
foregoing
facts
we
are
unable
to
conclude
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
the
proposed
operation.
the
commission
pointed
out
that
the
shippers
are
reasonably
satisfied
with
the
rail
service
except
that
they
complain
that
it
is
too
slow.
in
this
respect
the
commission
held
that
the
shippers
were
purposely
permitting
the
accumulation
of
pool-car
shipments
in
order
to
benefit
from
the
lower
pool-car
rate.
and
in
that
connection
it
is
noteworthy
that
exhibit
23
of
the
one
of
the
intervening
shippers
jones
brothers,
a
producer
of
granite
in
barre,
vermont,
the
record
page
330,
these
indicate
that
the
number
of
shipments
that
were
finished
and
the
date
upon
which
they
were
shipped.
and
the
average
number
of
days
a
shipment
is
held
amounts
to
99
days
and
a
minimum
number
of
days
was
28
days,
and
the
longest
a
186
days
from
the
time
that
granite
was
ready
to
be
shipped
until
it
was
actually
shipped.
it
further
pointed
out
that
while
the
less-than-carload
the
rail
service
was
not
as
expeditious
as
the
proposed
service,
nevertheless
it
was
fairly
good,
but
the
shippers
were
not
using
the
less-than-carload
service
because
of
the
higher
rate.
the
commission
thereupon
concluded,
“we
have
carefully
considered
applicant's
arguments
to
the
contrary
but
are
forced
to
conclude
that
the
service
presently
available
is
reasonably
adequate.
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
witnesses'
main
purpose
in
supporting
the
application
is
to
obtain
lower
rates
than
improved
service.
it
is
well
settled
that
this
is
not
a
proper
basis
for
grant
of
authority
and
the
application
therefore
must
be
denied.”
in
view
of
this
conclusion,
the
commission
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
the
question
of
applicant's
fitness
to
conduct
the
proposed
service.
now
this
court
has
held
in
chesapeake
&
ohio
railway
coal
v.
united
states
283
u.s.,
there
is
no
specification
of
a
consideration
by
which
the
commission
is
to
be
governed
in
determining
whether
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
a
proposed
construction.
under
the
act
it
was
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
find
the
facts
and
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
judgment
to
determine
the
question.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that
was
in,
partly
in
1931
or
1932.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
it
was
prior
to
the
motor
carrier
act
where
that
particular
phrase
was
inserted.
now
the
latter
case,
concerned
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
the
abandonment
of
rail
lines
pursuant
to
section
118
of
the
act.
when
the
motor
carrier
act
was
passed
in
1935
language
similar
to
that
used
in
section
118
was
added
to
the
later
act
resulting
in
what
is
now
designated
as
section
207(a).
in
interstate
commerce
commission
v.
parker,
this
court
held
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
leave
to
the
commission,
authoritatively,
to
decide
whether
additional
motor
carrier
service
would
serve
public
convenience
and
necessity.
this
of
course
gives
administrative
discretion
to
the
commission
to
draw
its
conclusion
from
the
infinite
variety
of
circumstances
which
may
occur
in
specific
instances.
we
submit
that
the
commission
when
it
made
its
ultimate
conclusions
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
its
authority
which
has
been
sanctioned
on
several
occasions
by
this
court.
the
record
before
the
commission
is
replete
with
evidence
showing
that
the
shippers
were
motivated
by
a
desire
for
lower
rates
rather
than
for
a
need
for
additional
or
for
better
service.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no,
this
court
has
not,
but
on
the
other
hand
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
dixie
carriers
case
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
this
is
--
if
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
understand
what
your
honor
is
driving
at.
however,
if
we
had
to
measure
inherited
advantage
solely
on
the
basis
of
rates,
why
in
this
particular
case
the
evidence
definitely
points
that
the
rails
can
carry
this
low
grade
commodity
much
cheaper
than
the
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
the
commission
in
its
conclusions
points
out
that
the
only
time
that
there
might
be
some
traffic
attracted
to
this
motor
carrier
is
on
the
less
than
carload
service,
and
in
no
other
case.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
the
commission's
report
does
not
state
so.
it
merely
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
the
commission's
report
as
we
have
pointed
out
indicates
that
they
have
discussed
and
analyzed
all
of
the
testimony
of
the
very
shippers,
and
also
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
but
this
record
doesn't
indicate
whether
or
not
the
motor
carrier
service
would
be
cheaper.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
that
was
one
of
the
reasons.
the
other
reason
was
that
the
presently
available
service
was
adequate.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
may
i
add
this
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
commission,
the
entire
commission
when
it
considered
this
case,
considered
the
entire
matter
and
that
the
--
there
was
involved
here
not
only
a
westward
movement,
but
also
an
eastward
movement
and
in
consideration
of
the
entire
case
have
decided
that
the
presently
available
service
whether
motor
or
rail
was
adequate.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
legal
criteria
is
that
under
the
act
the
commission
must
find
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
require
this
particular
type
of
service.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
the
ultimate
thing.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
government
considerations
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
number
one
the
commission
looked
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
number
one,
the
commission
looked
to
whether
or
not
the
shippers
had
disclosed
a
need
for
this
service
independent
of
rates,
of
rate
considerations.
secondly
whether
or
not
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
essentially
that
is
true.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
the
criteria
unless
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
no
it
wouldn't
be,
but
on
the
other
hand
the
situation
in
this
case
happens
to
be
that
the
commission
looked
to
the
record,
found
that
the
shippers
had
not
disclosed
a
need
for
this
particular
service
and
that
the
present
service
whatever
it
happened
to
be,
whether
motor
carrier
or
rail
appeared
to
be
adequate
to
take
care
of
any
of
the
traffic
which
the
shippers
decide
to
offer
to
the
carriers.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well,
that
maybe
true
your
honor,
but
on
the
other
hand
in
this
particular
case
the
evidence
seems
to
indicate
that
the
shippers
would
continue
using
the
rail
service
regardless
because
it
happens
to
be
the
cheapest
service.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
well
if
i
may
continue
i
will
probably
touch
on
that
in
discussing
the
commission's
view
regarding
the
national
transportation
policy
which
i
think
has
a
bearing
on
that
particular
point.
since
there
are
adequate
remedies
to
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
rates
in
other
parts
of
the
act,
the
commission
has
consistently
refused
to
consider
rates,
as
pertinent
in
certificate
proceedings,
whether
the
satisfaction
results
from
rail
or
motor
carrier
rates,
the
commission's
consistent
policy
applies
because
the
essential
requirement
of
section
207(a)
is
that
the
applicant
bears
the
burden
of
affirmatively
showing
that
a
need
exists
for
the
proposed
service.
here
the
applicant
failed
to
hurdle
the
first
test
that
is
to
show
that
the
service
was
needed
independent
of
rate
considerations.
thus
the
commission
concluded
one,
that
the
shippers
are
interested
only
in
lower
rates,
rather
than
improved
service
and
two
that
the
service
presently
available
which
includes
rail
service
is
reasonably
adequate.
it
was
upon
these
two
conclusions
that
the
commission
made
its
ultimate
finding
that
no
need
was
shown
for
the
service.
although
the
appellant
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
in
most
cases
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
--
the
commission
does
do
that
because
in
most
cases
mr.
justice
frankfurter
the
commission
does
do
that
because
rate
considerations
can
be
taken
care
of
adequately
under
other
sections
of
the
act,
for
example,
section
13
or
section
216,
with
respect
to
motor
carrier
act.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
agree
to
that,
provided
that
the
applicant
affirmatively
shows
that
there
is
a
need
for
his
service.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
in
various
situations
the
commission
has
stated
where
there
hasn't
been
any
service
available,
either
rail
or
motor,
there
is
a
need
for
this
particular
type
of
service
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
needed.
then
you
get
to
the
point
where
the
shipper
has
both
rail
service
and
motor
carrier
service,
but
that
rail
service
does
not
quite
give
him
the
expeditious
type
of
service
let
us
say,
the
door
to
door
handling
service
and
other
so
called
inherent
advantages
which
the
motor
carrier
service
provides,
in
those
situations
where
the
shipper
has
definitely
shown
that
he
requires
this
types
of
inherent
advantage,
then
the
commission
has
in
most
cases
granted
the
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
it
may.
in
the
aj
network
case
which
is
cited
in
the
commission's
brief
and
also
in
the
statement
through
the
senate
committee,
select
committee
on
the
small
business,
the
commission
pointed
out,
that
in
a
given
case
where
the
question
of
limited
amount
of
traffic
and
a
question
as
to
which
carrier
needs
that
type
of
traffic
more
than
the
other
type
of
carrier,
that
the
commissioner
in
that
situation
would
have
to
consider
the
needs
of
the
carrier
which
may
lose
this
traffic
rather
than
putting
in
competing
forms
of
service.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
that's
right.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
there
is.
there
is
an
element
of
promoting
competition,
but
depending
upon
the
particular
case
and
the
circumstances
and
each
case
much
rest
upon
on
the
individual
facts
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
h.
neil
garson
the
fatality
in
this
particular
case
was
that
the
applicant
failed
to
show
in
the
--
as
the
commission
pointed
out,
for
his
particular
type
of
service
and
in
addition
that
the
transportation
which
is
now
available
to
the
shippers
was
adequate
and
that
was
the
finding
of
the
commission
--
mr.
h.
neil
garson
i
must
assume
that
it
was
based
on
all
three
elements
because
as
the
subsidiary
findings
unfold,
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
shippers
failed
to
take
advantage
of
faster
service
which
is
provided
by
the
railroads
primarily
because
of
rate
considerations,
although
it
was
available.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
do
want
to
mention
one
point
that
the
commission
in
this
particular
case
has
based
its
findings,
it
has
concluded
and
denied
the
application
on
two
findings,
number
one
that
there
was
a
failure
to
show
a
need
for
the
service
and
number
two
that
the
present
service
including
rail
is
reasonably
adequate.
this
was
so
found
by
the
court
below
which
said
that
the
commission
purported
to
weigh
all
of
the
surrogate
factors
constituting
proof
of
need
of
the
service
and
in
addition
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
commission's
policy
as
announced
in
the
aj
metler
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
35
and
for
the
reasons
stated
it
is
submitted
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
