mr.
amos
m.
mathews
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
go
into
one
thing
that
i
am
not
sure
is
clear.
this
is
quite
an
unusual
case
in
the
review
of
the
order
of
an
administrative
agency
in
that
no
one
has
challenged
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
findings
and
conclusions.
no
one
has
challenged
the
commission's
findings.
now
it
is
almost
a
stereotype
in
review
of
an
administrative
order,
and
you
heard
a
great
deal
about
that
yesterday
in
respect
to
the
milwaukee
suburban
fair
case.
in
review
of
an
administrative
order,
to
say
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
insufficient
to
support
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
commission,
but
no
one
has
made
that
point
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
mr.
weston's
argument
representing
the
department
of
justice,
all
of
his
argument,
however,
was
an
argument
to
the
evidence,
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
support
the
commission's
finding,
but
the
department
of
justice
in
their
brief,
in
their
statement
of
the
question
presented
did
not
present
that
question,
that
is
on
page
two
of
their
brief.
they
say,
well
it's
rather
detailed,
but
they
simply
state
that
the
question
is
the
legal
--
is
the
proper
construction
of
207(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
appellants
themselves
did
not
raise
any
question
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
whether
the
evidence
supports
the
findings,
whether
the
subsidiary
findings
support
the
ultimate
finding
or
anything
of
that
sort.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
examine
the
appellant's
brief,
the
appellant's
brief
is
quite
clear
on
this
i
believe,
in
it's
entirely
and
in
the
question
presented,
the
only
question
that
the
appellants
have
presented
here,
is
whether
or
not,
in
an
application
under
207(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
where
there
is
no
motor
carrier
service
existing
in
the
area
for
which
the
authority
is
sought,
may
the
commission
in
determining
public
convenience
and
necessity,
take
into
consideration
the
existing
railroad
service
in
the
area.
now
we
have
stated
that
as
the
sole
question
presented
in
our
brief
and
appellants
filed
a
reply
brief
and
they
did
not
take
exception
to
that
in
anyway.
therefore,
we
say
at
the
outset,
that
a
--
quite
a
bit
of
the
argument
here,
and
it
is
somewhat
beside
the
point,
in
that
here
we
have
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction
and
not
a
question,
the
ordinary
and
usual
run
of
the
mind
question
as
to
whether
the
administrative
agency
upon
the
evidence
before
it,
reach
the
correct
conclusion
on
the
facts.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
oh
that
is
correct.
i'll
come
back
to
that
later
on.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
that's
right.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
yes,
i
will
go
to
that
right
now,
and
that
i
think
involves
the
construction
of
207(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
as
i
say
is
the
point
on
which
this
case
turns.
now
counsel
for
the
appellants
stated
that
for
a
long
period,
the
commission
had
consistently
held
that
where
there
was
no
motor
carrier
service
available
in
an
area,
the
commission
had
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
shipper
was
entitled
to
motor
carrier
service
and
therefore
upon
the
applicant
proving
ability
to
perform
and
so
forth,
the
fact
that
there
was
railroad
service
existing
was
not
taken
into
consideration.
now
it
is
true
that
that
was
the
policy
of
the
commission
from
1935
to
1940
and
that
was
based
upon
the
declaration
of
policy
in
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935,
but
in
1940
the
congress
repealed
the
declaration
of
policy
in
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935
and
substituted
therefore
the
national
transportation
policy
with
which
you
are
all
familiar.
and
after
that
the
commission
changed
its
policy
and
in
1942
in
the
first
case
so
far
as
i
can
find
in
bailey
common
carrier
application,
in
that
case
there
was
no
motor
carrier
service
available
in
the
area
for
which
the
new
authority
was
sought.
and
the
commission,
citing
the
national
transportation
policy,
held
that
it
nevertheless
had
statutory
authority
to
deny
the
application
despite
the
absence
of
railroad
service
in
the
area.
and
despite
what
counsel
for
appellants
say
to
the
contrary
that
has
been
the
commission's
consistent
policy
where
the
issue
has
come
before
it
ever
since
1942
and
that
is
based
upon
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
we
certainly
take
the
issue
very
sharply
with
the
counsel
for
the
appellants
when
they
say
that
the
national
transportation
policy
simply
picked
up
and
repeated
the
declaration
of
policy
in
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
now
--
i
will
get
to
this
later,
but
i
want
to
briefly
say
here
that
the
--
it's
our
view
that
this
question
was
settled
by
the
decision
in
alton
railroad
company
against
united
states
315
us
15.
and
because
there
that
case
the
railroads
were
held
to
have
standing
to
seek
a
review
of
a
commission
order
not
upon
any
narrow
technical
grounds
that
merely
--
merely
because
the
statute
gave
them
the
authority,
but
because
as
this
court
found
citing
texas
and
pacific
against
colorado,
gulf,
santa
fe
and
so
forth,
that
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935
was
passed
to
protect
the
economic
interest
of
the
railroads
in
their
competition
with
motor
carriers.
this
court
cited
decisions
of
railroad
against
railroad
as
protecting
the
interest,
economic
interest
of
one
railroad
as
against
another
in
holding
that
the
motor
carrier
act
was
enacted
to
protect
economic
interest
of
railroad
against
motor
carrier
and
vice
versa.
now
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
to
grant
this
application
are
set
out
in
207(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
public
convenience
and
the
criterion
is
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now
basically
the
appellant's
claim
is
this
and
that
is
all
they've
talked
about
in
their
brief
and
that
is
--
there
was
a
question
presented
when
they
sought
a
review
of
this
case
and
that
is
question
presented
here
and
what
they
have
argued.
it's
this
that
section
207(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
an
implied
condition
that
where
there
is
no
motor
carrier
service
in
an
area
for
which
an
application
to
institute
new
motor
carrier
service
is
filed
that
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
the
motor
carrier
service
there
is
an
implied
condition
that
the
standards
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
are
somehow
lowered.
in
other
words
that
you
cannot
--
that
the
commission
cannot
consider
the
existing
railroad
service
in
the
area.
now,
if
the
court
please,
that
contention
is
entirely
erroneous
and
it
is
contrary
to
a
very
well
established
legislative
history.
congress
has
for
the
past
37
years
dealt
with
this
phrase
‘public
convenience
and
necessity'
and
with
variance
of
the
phrase.
and
congress
has
very
clearly
established
this
principle
that
where
congress
wants
to
give
to
the
administrative
agency
an
unlimited
discretion
in
dealing
with
an
application
for
new
public
service
authority
it
uses
the
phrase
‘public
convenience
and
necessity'
that
is
in
section
207(a),
but
where
on
the
other
hand
congress
wants
to
attach
to
the
granting
power
of
an
agency
some
condition
such
as
appellants
want
to
have
read
into
207(a)
here,
congress
does
it
in
expressed
terms.
mr.
amos
m.
mathews
--
continuation
of
the
argument,
first
i
want
to
go
back
to
this
matter
of
rates
that
has
been
talked
about.
i
said
at
the
recess
that
when
the
commission,
when
congress
wants
to
give
unlimited
discretion
to
an
administrative
body
they
use
the
term
public
convenience
and
necessity,
but
when
they
want
to
attach
some
condition
such
as
appellants
are
seeking
to
attach
to
the
commission's
authority
here,
then
congress
uses
specific
limiting
words.
now
that
was
evident
in
the
natural
gas
act;
the
natural
gas
act
as
it
first
was
enacted
was
held
by
the
federal
power
commission
to
prevent
railroads
and
coal
and
labor
interest
from
objecting
to
the
extension
of
natural
gas
lines.
but
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
that
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
congress
amended
the
act
for
the
very
purpose
of
permitting
coal,
labor
and
railroad
interest
to
come
before
the
federal
power
commission
and
object
to
the
extension
of
natural
gas
lines,
and
how
did
congress
bring
that
about?
congress
brought
that
about
by
incorporating
in
the
natural
gas
act
the
language
of
207
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
very
act
we
have
under
consideration
here.
and
the
same
committee
of
congress
that
brought
about
that
result
and
intentionally
so
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
i
haven't
time
to
read
it
here.
the
same
committee
--
the
house
committee
on
interstate
commerce,
the
same
men
within
two
months
of
that
also
approved
the
freight
forwarder
act
of
1942.
and
they
provided
in
that
act
that
the
commission
could
not
deny
authority
to
engage
in
business
as
a
freight
forwarder
because
another
freight
forwarder
was
rendering
service
in
the
area.
that
proved
to
allow
entering
into
the
freight
forwarder
business
and
make
it
too
easy
and
it
didn't
protect
freight
forwarders
already
in
the
field.
so
in
1957
congress
amended
that
act
by
changing
those
conditions
and
providing
that
any
one
entered
--
wishing
to
enter
the
business
of
a
freight
forwarder
must
prove
consistency
with
a
public
interest
except
that
a
rail
controlled
freight
forwarder
--
the
application
of
a
rail
controlled
freight
forwarder
could
not
be
denied
on
the
ground
that
there
was
another
freight
forwarder
operating
in
the
area.
i
have
gone
over
those
very
hastily.
they
are
all
set
out
in
our
brief,
but
they
show
very
clearly
that
congress
knows
exactly
--
congress
didn't
reach
into
a
hat
and
draw
out
a
collection
of
words
and
as
it
sometimes
do
throw
it
to
this
court
to
determine
what
congress
meant.
congress
says
use
this
term,
the
term
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
these
statutes
and
has
used
variance
of
that
phrase
over
the
past
37
years
in
such
a
way
to
demonstrate
that
the
language
of
207
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
comprehends
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
power
to
determine
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
does
not
require
motor
carrier
service
in
an
area
where
there
is
adequate
railroad
service
despite
the
fact
that
there
maybe
no
other
motor
carrier
service
serving
the
area.
now
that
is
very
clear
in
that
course
of
legislative
history
and
as
i
say
i
think
that
was
made
clear
back
in
1942
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
alton
railroad
company
against
united
states.
now
going
to
this
matter
of
rates,
it
is
--
it
would
seem
perfectly
clear
that
in
a
certificate
proceeding
where
a
motor
carrier
or
any
carrier
for
that
matter
files
application
for
authority
to
institute
new
service
that
that
cannot
possibly
be
the
occasion
of
determining
questions
of
rates.
there
is
adequate
rate
machinery
provided
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
just
as
a
rough
illustration
let
me
show
you
what
i
mean.
supposing
a
motor
carrier
applies
for
a
certificate
for
a
new
service
between
a
and
b,
and
the
railroads
come
in
and
they
show
that
they
can
furnish
better
service
at
cheaper
rates
between
a
and
b
than
this
motor
carrier
offers,
is
that
to
be
an
answer
in
a
certificate
case?
the
acts
of
congress
that
i've
referred
to
make
it
very
clear
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
comprehend
service
and
that
the
rate
factors
are
to
be
handled
in
other
situations.
now
getting
down
to
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
there
has
been
--
the
rate
argument
has
taken
much
wider
scope
than
it
should
have,
because
there
isn't
a
word
to
proof.
the
applicant
here
didn't
even
try
to
prove
that
he
would
give
a
better
rate
than
the
existing
rail
rate.
he
tried
to
prove
that
he
would
give
better
service,
but
the
commission
held
that
he
would
not
and
that
finding
has
not
been
attacked
in
anyway,
shape
or
form.
one
consideration
here,
this
is
certainly
not
a
perishable
commodity,
granite
monuments,
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
reason,
the
rail
--
for
complaints
against
slow
rail
service
was
that
shippers
waited
as
much
as
99
days
i
think
in
one
particular
case
to
accumulate
a
carload,
so
as
to
take
advantage
of
the
rail
carload
rates.
the
only
--
and
the
evidence
is
conclusive
on
this
also.
a
few
shippers
testified
that
if,
on
cross
examination,
that
if
schaffer,
the
applicant,
charged
a
higher
rate
than
the
railroads,
he
wouldn't
get
their
business.
now
–
so
i
–
the
--
if
you
just
think
over
a
certificate
case,
and
an
application
for
authority
or
see
that
it
just
would
be
impossible
to
try
out
all
the
questions
of
rates
involved
and
as
i
say
the
conclusive
answer
i
think
here
is
that
the
applicant
didn't
even
try
to
make
a
showing
that
he
would
give
a
better
rate.
there
was
nothing
in
here
at
all.
a
few
shippers
said
they'd
like
to
have
better
rates,
but
the
applicant
himself
didn't
make
any
such
showing.
now,
there
has
been
a
statement
made
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
impact
of
granting
this
service
upon
the
railroads.
all
of
the
traffic
that
is
here
in
controversy
upwards
of
4
million
pounds
a
year
have
granite
from
vermont
to
the
16
midwestern
states
is
now
moving
by
rail.
any
of
it
that
would
taken
by
the
result
of
granting
of
this
application
would
be
taken
from
the
railroads.
now
there
again,
that
was
considered
a
sufficient
--
in
the
alton
railroad
case,
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
the
specific
amount
of
traffic.
there
was
only
evidence
of
the
railroads
were
serving
all
the
points
in
question,
and
that
was
held
in
that
case
to
give
the
railroads
to
require
the
economic
status
of
the
railroads
to
be
given
consideration.
now
the
commission
considered
the
adequacy
of
the
railroad
service
and
nobody
has
attacked
its
findings
in
that
respect.
they
considered
the
need
of
the
shippers,
found
they
were
adequately
being
supplied
by
the
railroad
service,
nobody
has
said
the
commission's
--
the
evidence
before
the
commission
doesn't
support
that
finding.
of
course
the
rate
question
sort
of
came
in
--
sort
of
through
the
back
door
you
might
say,
simply
a
few
shippers
said
gratuitously
that
they'd
like
better
rates,
but
the
applicant
didn't
respond
to
that
by
saying
well
sure
you're
going
to
have
better
rates.
thank
you.
