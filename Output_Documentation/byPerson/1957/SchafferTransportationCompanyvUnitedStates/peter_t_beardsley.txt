mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
division
of
south
dakota.
that
court
in
turn
upheld
the
action
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
denied
schaffer's
application
to
transport
granite
between
various
points
and
places
in
the
united
states.
the
court's
decision
is
printed
in
the
record
at
359,
the
commission's
report
at
24
and
the
report
of
division
5,
of
the
commission
which
granted
most
of
schaffer's
application
and
which
was
reversed
by
the
entire
commission
on
reconsideration
is
shown
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
6.
the
appellants
here
are
schaffer,
a
very
small
motor
common
carrier
of
revillo,
south
dakota
and
american
trucking
association,
the
trade
association
of
the
motor
carrier
industry.
appellees
are
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
various
rail
organizations,
which
protested
schaffer's
application
before
the
commission.
the
government,
which
supported
the
commission's
decision
before
the
district
court,
now
supports
the
appellants
here.
schaffer
is
presently
authorized
to
transport
granite
from
grant
county,
south
dakota
to
points
in
15
states
ranging
from
montana
and
colorado
on
the
west
to
pennsylvania
and
new
york
on
the
east.
by
an
application,
which
is
involved
here,
schaffer
sought
to
expand
this
authority
to
transport
granite
from
the
same
origin
point
that
is
grant
county,
south
dakota
to
points
in
ten
eastern
states
in
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
reverse
direction
from
points
in
vermont
to
16
states
primarily
in
the
midwest.
the
maps
which
are
printed
in
the
record
at
294
and
296
show
the
method
in
which
the
proposed
operation
would
dovetail
or
complement
schaffer's
present
service.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
the
maps
are
shown
in
the
record
mr.
justice
douglas
at
294
and
296.
they
are
schaffer's
exhibits
4
and
5
before
the
commission.
the
schaffer's
application
was
protested
by
various
rail
groups
and
by
one
motor
common
carrier,
dingmann.
hearings
were
held
before
an
examiner,
who
recommended
a
grant
of
authority
substantially
as
requested
by
schaffer.
exceptions
were
filed
for
the
examiner's
recommended
grant
of
authority
and
division
5
affirmed
the
examiner's
report
except
that
it
eliminated
authority
from
grant
county,
south
dakota
to
four
eastern
states
in
the
district
of
columbia,
those
states
are
maryland,
connecticut,
massachusetts
and
vermont.
because
the
division
held
that
since
dingmann,
the
one
protested
motor
carrier,
have
authority
to
provide
service
to
those
points
which
service
had
not
been
shown
to
be
in
any
manner
inadequate.
there
was
no
reason
to
duplicate
that
authority
in
effect
by
another
grant
on
the
same
authority
to
schaffer.
now
neither
appellant
has
taken
any
exception
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding
to
that
partial
denial
of
the
authority.
the
railroads
then
petitioned
for
reconsideration
and
the
commission
ultimately
reversed
the
order
of
its
division
5
and
denied
the
application
all
together.
the
only
basis
assigned
in
the
commission's
report
for
denying
the
application
were,
one
that
the
existing
rail
service
was
adequate
to
meet
the
shippers'
needs
and
two
that
in
any
event
the
main
purpose
of
the
shippers
here
was
to
get
lower
rates
rather
than
an
improved
service
by
virtue
of
schaffer's
operations.
the
question
as
we
see
it
maybe
very
simply
stated
is
an
applicant
for
motor
carrier
authority
required
to
prove,
among
other
things,
that
existing
rail
service
is
inadequate
or
to
put
in
another
way,
are
the
shippers
of
the
country
entitled
to
service
by
all
available
forms
of
transport,
or
is
the
commission
authorized
to
determine
as
it
has
in
this
case
that
only
the
services
of
the
railroad
shall
be
utilized.
the
statutory
provisions
involved
are
the
national
transportation
policy
and
section
207
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
49
us
code
307.
the
provisions
of
the
policy
are
set
forth
in
the
original
brief
which
we
filed
here
at
page
34,
the
provision
of
section
207
are
reproduced
at
page
38
of
that
brief
and
i
might
add
that
we
have
filed
also
in
this
case
a
reply
brief.
coming
now
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
we
point
out
that
from
the
beginning
of
federal
regulation
of
motor
carriers,
until
1950,
the
commission
in
a
long
line
of
decisions
held
that
shippers
are
entitled
to
adequate
service
by
motor
vehicle
as
well
as
rail.
and
the
bowles
case
which
we
cite
at
page
7
of
our
original
brief
here
decided
in
1937
is
a
landmark
decision
in
this
field.
there,
as
in
this
case,
the
railroad
protesters,
who
were
before
the
commission
seeking
to
have
the
application
to
perform
motor
service
to
denied,
contended
that
railroad
service
was
adequate
to
meet
the
shippers'
need.
as
to
this
contention,
when
it
was
put
then
in
1937,
the
commission
said
that
a
particular
point
has
adequate
rail
service
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
denial
of
a
certificate.
shippers
and
consignees
of
petroleum
are
entitled
to
adequate
service
by
motor
vehicle
as
well
as
rail.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no
mr.
justice
harlan
it
does
not
mean
that,
we
have
never
contended
that
here.
it
would
mean
i
think
that
the
burden
which
the
applicant
had
to
show
would
be
somewhat
less
than
if
there
were
already
service
of
the
same
kind
in
the
field.
but
obviously
he
has
to
prove
a
need
for
service
and
in
addition
he
has
to
show
under
the
requirements
of
section
207
that
he
is
fit,
willing
and
able
to
perform
the
service.
in
other
words,
if
he
were
a
near
irresponsible
character,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir.
well
as
i
was
saying
in
our
original
brief
we
cited
in
more
than
50
cases
in
which
the
commission
followed
the
principle
which
it
established
first
in
the
bowles
case,
including
two
which
involved,
as
does
this
case,
a
transportation
of
granite.
now
the
shoe
hasn't
always
been
on
the
same
foot
in
these
cases.
there
have
been
lots
of
instances
in
which
motor
carrier
have
appeared
before
the
commission
and
protested
against
applications
by
other
forms
of
transport,
for
example,
water
transport,
and
they
have
said
to
the
commission,
our
service
is
adequate
there
is
no
need
for
this
motor
transport.
the
commission
has
invariably
told
them
in
those
cases,
regardless
of
the
adequacy
of
motor
service
that
is
no
reason
to
deny
an
application
to
perform
a
different
type
of
service,
water
service.
the
same
holdings
have
come
forth
in
instances
in
which
motor
carriers
have
appeared
as
protesters
for
example
the
application
to
perform
freight
forwarding
service.
and
so
in
reality
the
commission
has
assigned
to
the
motor
transport
industry
the
dubious
distinction
of
being
the
one
transport
agency
which
can
be
done
without,
if
some
other
form
of
transport
can
be
found
to
be
adequate.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
the
commission
contends
they
are
material
because
they
say
the
shippers
were
interested
only
in
lower
rates.
we
contend
that
they
are
immaterial.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
the
shippers
are
indeed
entitled
to
service
by
both
forms
of
transportation.
what
underlies
their
motives
in
wanting
that
transportation
is
immaterial.
now
obviously
if
later
on
once
the
motor
authority
has
recognized
in
put
into
being,
then
the
commission
always
have
authority
when
these
rate
questions
come
up
to
determine
what
the
rate
should
be
by
the
particular
form
of
transport
involved.
we
haven't
reached
that
point
in
this
case
mr.
justice
burton.
the
bowles
case
of
course
was
decided
as
i
said
before
1937,
prior
to
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
even
then
the
provisions
of
section
202
(a)
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
among
other
things,
required
the
commission
to
preserve
the
inherit
advantages
of
motor
transportation.
and
in
the
bowles
case
there
commission
referred
among
other
things
to
that
requirement
of
the
statute
and
based
on
that
requirement
ultimately
concluded,
as
i
said
before,
that
shippers
are
entitled
to
adequate
motor
as
well
as
rail
service.
and
so
our
position
is
that
when
congress
in
1940
substantially
reenacted
as
a
part
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
provisions
of
section
202
(a)
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
if
approved
the
commission's
consistent
construction,
which
had
previously
been
said
forth
and
to
which
i
previously
referred.
now
here
we
encounter
two
arguments
from
the
appellees.
first
the
railroad
say,
and
i
think
they
have
to
say
it
of
necessity,
that
section
202
(a)
the
motor
carrier
act
was
repealed
by
the
transportation
act
of
1940
and
that
the
national
transportation
policy
which
was
then
enacted,
required
the
commission
to
change
its
rule
of
decision
embodied
in
the
bowles
case.
well
first
of
all
of
course
if
that
is
so
the
commission
waited
a
mighty
long
time
to
change
its
rule
decision,
but
that's
more
or
less
beside
the
point.
the
first
thing
wrong
with
this
rail
argument
i
think
is
a
fact
that
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
when
congress
enacted
the
national
transportation
policy,
to
a
large
extent
it
was
simply
putting
in
one
package,
requirements
which
were
already
imposed
on
the
commission
by
provisions
of
other
statutes.
for
example,
and
i
am
reverting
again
to
bowles,
the
commission
said
there
we're
advised
by
statute
that
it
is
the
policy
of
congress
to
foster
and
preserve
in
full
vigor
both
rail
and
water
transportation.
now
that
reference
of
course
was
to
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
but
the
commission
went
on
to
point
out,
as
i
said
that,
it
was
also
required
to
preserve
the
inherited
advantages
of
motor
transport
and
it
reached
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
the
shippers
were
entitled
to
both
forms
of
service.
now
i
think
the
best
way
to
demonstrate,
the
second
thing
wrong
with
this
rail
argument,
because
it's
essentially
similar
to
the
contentions
i'm
coming
to,
is
to
refer
to
the
report
of
the
entire
commission
in
greyhound
corporation
control,
florida
motorlines
corp.
now
while
we
have
citied
a
good
many
cases
in
our
brief,
i'm
frank
to
say
we
didn't
cite
that,
but
it's
after
(inaudible)
and
i
would
like
to
quote
it.
the
commission
there
said
this,
“greyhound
also
contends
that
in
enacting
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
congress
recognized
that
the
emphasis
which
both
it
and
the
commission
have
theretofore
put
upon
the
desirability
of
preserving
competition
between
carriers
engaged
in
the
same
mode
of
transportation
was
no
longer
necessary.”
skipping
a
few
extraneous
words,
“there
is
nothing
in
the
transportation
policy
which
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
the
preservation
of
competition
among
operators
in
the
motor
bus
transportation
field
should
be
considered
any
less
important
than
in
other
types
of
transportation
or
that
the
long
established
policy
of
preserving
reasonable
competition
in
transportation
should
be
discarded.
the
administration
of
the
act
so
as
to
preserve
the
inherent
advantage
of
each
mode
of
transportation
requires
continued
competition,
among
bus
operators,
striving
to
render
the
best
possible
service
to
the
travelling
public
and
the
spec
of
competition
goes
far
to
encourage
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
reasonable
charges
for
transportation
service
without
undue
preferences
or
advantages
or
disruptive
competitive
practices,”
and
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
the
commission
reached
there
was
this.
“we
are
unable
to
agree
with
greyhound's
contention
that
congress
intended
to
substitute
our
regulation
for
the
long
established
elements
of
competition
in
the
field
of
motor
bus
transportation.”
well
of
course
what
they
said
there
by
motor
bus
transportation
is
equally
applicable
to
motor
truck
transportation.
now
the
second
argument
that
we
meet
comes
primarily
from
the
commission,
which
says
that
we
lay
too
much
stress
on
the
inherent
advantages
provisions
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
that
we
in
effect
overlook
the
other
provisions
of
the
policy.
the
commission
says
on
the
contrary,
that
when
it
denied
schaffer's
application,
it
took
into
account
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
policy.
now
let
me,
if
i
may,
attempt
an
analysis
of
the
decision
here
to
demonstrate
just
how
it
took
in
the
account
these
various
provisions.
first,
and
admittedly
it
protects
the
railroads
against
schaffer's
proposed
competition
both
rate
and
service
wise.
and
i
assume
the
commission
will
argue
that
in
doing
so
it
thus
preserved
the
inherent
advantages
of
rail
service.
but
even
so,
the
commission's
brief
itself
notes
that
even
if
the
application
had
been
granted,
the
shippers
involved
would
have
continued
to
use
rail
carload
service.
and
so
a
grant
of
schaffer's
application
would
have
recognized
the
inherent
advantages
of
both
modes
of
transportation,
instead
of
excluding
the
one
in
favor
of
the
other.
so
we
say
that
right
off
the
bat,
the
commission's
decision
violates
the
cardinal
rule,
that
every
part
of
a
statute
must
be
construed
in
connection
with
the
whole,
so
as
to
make
all
the
parts
harmonize
if
possible
and
gives
meaning
to
each,
and
of
course
that's
washington
market
case
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
five.
the
second
thing
wrong
with
the
commission's
decision
here
is
that
it
positively
ignores
its
obligation
under
the
national
transportation
policy
to
promote
adequate
economic
and
efficient
service.
i've
already
referred
to
the
greyhound
case
in
which
the
commission
made
it
clear
that
reasonable
competition
is
necessary
if
these
aims
of
the
policy
are
to
be
accomplished.
we've
also
dealt
with
this
subject
at
some
length
in
our
original
brief
and
i
won't
say
more
here
except
to
point
out
the
obvious,
and
that
is
that
the
commission's
decisions
maintaining
as
it
does
a
rail
monopoly
can
scarcely
be
said
to
promote
adequate
economic
and
efficient
service
as
required
by
the
national
transportation
policy.
so
if
i
may
on
this
phase
of
the
case,
let
me
sum
up
by
just
trying
to
see
how
the
commission
balanced
these
various
requirements.
as
stated,
we
concede
that
the
commission
sought
to
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
rail
service,
but
i've
pointed
out
that,
that
was
not
necessary,
that
even
if
schaffer's
application
had
been
granted,
the
railroad's
inherent
advantage
would
not
have
been
destroyed,
but
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
ledger.
the
commission
denied
the
shippers
the
inherent
advantages
of
motor
service
and
in
doing
so
failed
to
provide
the
fair
and
impartial
regulations
of
all
modes
of
transportation,
which
again
is
required
by
the
national
transportation
policy.
by
maintaining
the
existing
rail
monopoly,
the
commission
fails
to
promote
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
service
and
fails
to
encourage
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
reasonable
charges.
and
for
this
reasons
we
say
that
the
commission's
contention
that
its
decision
here
took
into
account
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
national
transportation
policy
simply
doesn't
hold
water.
it
would
be
far
more
accurate
to
say
that
the
commission's
decision
here
just
ignores
the
provisions
of
the
policy.
now
in
their
briefs,
the
appellees
have
made
several
arguments
which
we
don't
believe
are
properly
available
to
them
before
the
court,
for
the
reason
that
first
they
find
no
support
in
the
record
itself,
second
they
are
not
even
discussed
in
the
report
of
the
commission
which
i
before
the
court.
the
first
argument
i'd
like
to
touch
on
is
the
commission's
argument
that
in
denying
schaffer's
application
it
was
complying
with
the
requirement
of
the
national
transportation
policy
that
it
foster
sound
economic
conditions
in
transportation.
now
i
assume
this
means
that
if
in
a
given
case
the
commission
has
found
that
a
grant
of
authority
to
a
motor
carriage
would
have
such
serious
repercussions
on
the
existing
rail
service
as
to
make
it
less
able
to
function
(inaudible)
then
it
might
deny
the
motor
authority
for
that
reason.
well,
first
we
seriously
doubt
the
validity
of
that
theory,
but
i
don't
really
need
to
make
any
attempt
to
repudiate
it
here
because
there
isn't
a
bit
of
a
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
claim
that
schaffer's
proposed
operations
would
have
any
serious
impact
at
all
on
the
commission
and
it
isn't
even
mentioned
in
the
commission's
report,
and
probably
because
the
commission
didn't
want
to
get
laughed
out
of
court
by
making
such
a
comment.
now
what
i
said
here
is
applicable
equally
to
the
rather
lengthy
discussion
of
other
statutes,
which
occupy
16
pages
in
the
rail
brief,
at
pages
24
to
40
of
their
brief.
now
if
we
understand
the
argument
that
they
put
out
there,
it
is
that
the
commission
again
has
discretion
to
deny
a
motor
authority
where
any
serious
impact
would
exist,
would
be
effected
upon
the
rail
service,
but
we
don't
have
to
meet
with
that
argument.
we've
dealt
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
with
this
phase
of
the
case
and
i
think
i'll
just
leave
it
there
if
i
may.
the
second
argument,
not
available
to
the
commission
here,
is
that
the
traffic
available
wouldn't
support
schaffer's
proposed
operation,
again
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
contention
and
the
subject
is
not
discussed
in
the
commission's
report.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
the
court
will
turn
to
the
only
point
where
i
find
it
discussed
outside
of
the
examiner's
report,
is
the
report
of
division
5
at
record
22,
it's
noted
that
the
division
said
the
proposed
service
would
tie
in
nicely
with
schaffer's
existing
service
and
at
the
times
available
would
enable
schaffer
to
provide
an
efficient
and
economical
service.
now
the
third
argument
and
it's
fair
to
say
that
only
the
commission
makes
it,
is
that
shippers
supporting
schaffer
should
have
used
the
service
of
existing
motor
carriers
before
seeking
additional
service.
well
the
short
answer
to
that
is
there
simply
isn't
any
existing
motor
service
and
the
railroads
admit
it,
in
their
question
presented
in
their
brief
at
page
one
of
their
brief
and
in
their
statement
of
the
case,
they
make
it
clear
that
there
isn't
any
motor
service.
despite
this,
the
commission's
brief
refers
to
cases,
which
hold
that
existing
motor
carriers
are
entitled
to
transport
all
the
traffic
they
can
handle
adequately,
economically
and
efficiently
without
the
competition
of
a
new
motor
carrier
service.
we
have
no
problem
with
those
cases,
except
they
have
no
application
here.
to
the
extent
that
division
5
denied
the
authority
requested
by
schaffer's
insofar
as
it
duplicated
the
existing
service
of
the
one
motor
protestant
(inaudible),
it
conformed
to
that
theory.
commission's
brief
also
tells
us
that
the
decision
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
is
(inaudible)
versus
us
139,
fed
sub
440
supports
this
decision
here.
now
really
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
fact.
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
did
allege
that
his
application
was
denied
because
rail
service
was
held
to
be
adequate,
but
here
is
what
the
court
said
about
that
allegation
and
i'm
quoting
from
139
fed
sub
443,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
united
states
both
take
the
position
that
this
issue
does
not
arise
because
they
say
that
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
before
the
commission
to
the
effect
that
there
is
also
motor
carrier
service
available
to
serve
the
points
involved
in
the
complainant's
application
and
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that,
that
was
the
fact
in
that
case,
which
of
course
is
decided
is
not
the
fact
here.
coming
next
to
the
commission's
argument
about
lower
rates,
their
additional
contention
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
found
that
existing
rail
service
was
adequate,
there
is
something
reprehensible
and
shippers
warning
lower
rates
by
motor
carrier,
and
that's
not
a
good
reason
for
granting
an
application.
now
we
have
dealt
with
this
argument
rather
extensively
in
our
reply
brief,
and
i
just
want
to
touch
on
it
here.
going
to
back
commission's
holding
again
in
the
(inaudible),
as
i
stated
before,
if
shippers
are
entitled
to
adequate
motor
as
well
as
rail
service,
then
what
earthly
difference
does
it
make,
what's
in
the
back
of
their
mind
when
they
come
before
the
commission
and
ask
to
have
this
service
made
available
to
them
which
does
not
presently
exist.
i
refer
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
mechling
case,
in
which
you
said
this
at
330
u.s.
567.
you
previously
have
referred
in
that
decision
through
the
provisions
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
certain
provisions
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“the
foregoing
provisions
flatly
forbid
the
commission
to
approve
barge
rates
or
barge
rail
rates,
which
do
not
preserve
intact
the
inherit
advantages
of
cheaper
motor
--
cheaper
water
transportation,
but
discriminate
against
as
water
carrier
and
the
goods
they
transport.”
now
the
commission
has
frequently
held
that
motor
transportation
has
certain
inherited
advantages,
which
i
have
no
counterpart
in
rail
service.
in
(inaudible)
an
official
territory
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
original
brief
at
page
26,
the
commission
said
that
motor
transport
unlike
rail
transport
is
individualized
expedited
and
more
flexible
than
rail
transportation.
now
if
the
motor
carriers
have
these
inherent
advantages,
they
can't
be
here
one
minute
and
gone
the
next.
they
are
there.
this
being
so,
we
believe
the
language
of
the
mclean
case,
which
i
just
referred
to,
can
properly
be
paraphrased
to
state
something
like
this.
the
commission
is
forbidden
by
the
national
transport
policy
to
discriminate
against
motor
transportation
by
refusal
to
preserve
intact
its
inherited
advantages
by
arbitrarily
denying
motor
carriers
the
right
to
compete
with
the
existing
rail
service
and
that
in
effect
is
just
what
we
ask
this
court
to
hold
here.
now
one
final
point,
both
of
the
appellees
claim
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
alton
case
supports
the
commission's
decision
here.
commission's
brief
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
rationale
of
the
alton
decision,
without
more,
demonstrates
that
it
was
proper
for
the
commission
to
take
into
account
with
other
factors
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
rail
service.
i
have
already
shown
that
the
only
other
factors
which
the
commission's
report
took
into
account
here
were
one.
the
fact
that
the
shippers
were
allegedly
interested
only
in
lower
rates
rather
than
improved
service
and
i
hope
i
have
made
the
point
that
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
existing
motor
service
that
that
factor
is
a
completely
invalid.
but
coming
to
the
alton
case
itself,
it
was
limited
solely
to
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
authorized
motor
operations
greater
in
scope
than
had
been
performed
prior
to
the
so
called
grandfather
date
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
now
since
the
question
there
that
is
to
say
since
the
operation
that
it
could
be
performed
as
a
matter
of
right
subsequent
to
the
grandfather
date
providing
only
that
it
could
be
proved
prior
to
it,
alton
did
not
involve
any
question
of
adequacy
of
rail
service
nor
even
a
question
of
whether
--
what
motivated
the
shippers
in
supporting
the
application
because
obviously
there
wasn't
any
need
for
shippers
support
there.
this
court
when
it
upheld
the
commission's
grant
of
the
authority
simply
said
that
the
railroads
who
were
protesters
before
the
commission
had
standing
to
sue
to
set
aside
its
order
in
the
federal
courts.
now
we
believe
that
holding
has
no
application
at
all
in
this
case.
we
have
never
contented
here
that
the
railroads
weren't
properly
protesters
before
the
commission,
or
that
it
had
been,
been
less
pleased
with
its
decision,
they
couldn't
have
brought
a
suit
to
set
it
aside.
but
we
don't
think
that
that
can
be
twisted
to
say
in
effect
that
once
the
commission
has
held
that
rail
service
is
adequate
that
bars
the
institution
of
the
entirely
different
type
of
motor
transport
which
schaffer
sought
to
provide.
railroads
like
any
other
protesters
are
entitled
to
participate
in
proceedings
before
the
commission.
in
an
effort
to
defeat
an
applicant's
case
by
showing
that
he
can't
need
any
one
or
more,
the
standards
mentioned,
but
the
alton
case
which
merely
upheld
their
standing
to
do
that
and
to
take
the
necessary
following
step
before
the
courts
can't
be
twisted,
as
the
appellees
seek
to
do,
to
support
a
claim
that
once
the
commission
has
found
that
rail
service
is
adequate,
then
the
denial
of
a
motor
application
to
provide
a
entirely
different
type
of
motor
service
is
justified
on
that
basis.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
one
or
two
items
if
the
court
please?
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
agreed
that
the
question
of
rates
came
in
here
by
the
back
door.
the
applicant
didn't
try
to
make
a
showing
that
he
would
quote
lower
rates
for
the
simple
reason
that
had
he
done
so
the
commission
would
have
told
him,
the
commissioner
or
the
examiner
on
the
objection
that
the
rail
(inaudible)
would
have
said
rates
are
not
relevant
for
a
proceeding
like
this.
by
and
large
the
question
of
rates
came
into
the
record
because
of
rail
counsel,
on
cross
examination
of
the
shipper
witness
brought
out
that
they
would
like
lower
rates.
now
there
isn't
a
shipper
in
the
country
i
contend,
i
talked
to
a
few
of
them,
that
won't
tell
you
no
matter
what
form
of
transportation
he
uses,
he
thinks
his
rates
are
too
high,
and
if
all
that
remains
to
be
done
in
cases
of
this
kind
is
for
rail
counsel
to
innocently
inquire
of
a
supporting
shipper
in
a
motor
case,
do
you
think
your
rates
are
too
high
and
if
he
is
honest
he
will
say
yes
they
are,
then
they
come
back
to
the
commission
and
say
these
shippers
are
motivated
by
desire
for
lower
rates,
their
goal
is
to
dismiss
the
application
and
that
is
the
gist
of
their
argument
no
matter
how
they
try
to
feather
it
up.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no,
i
really
don't.
i
really
don't
think
that
rates
as
such
are
relevant
except
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
has
allowed
this
rate
argument
which
crept
in
sideways
into
this
case
to
deprive
the
shippers
of
a
opportunity
by
utilization
of
this
motor
service
proposed
to
be
run
to
first
get
an
improved
service
and
second
to
get
the
benefit
rate
wise
if
you
please
of
competition
between
the
true
forms
of
transportation
within
this
so
called
zone
of
reason.
obviously
if
there
is
only
rail
service,
the
rail
rates
are
going
to
be
at
the
top
of
zone
of
reason.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
will
simply
refer
you
to
the
report
of
division
five,
where
at
the
bottom
of
page
21
of
the
record
and
the
top
of
page
22,
there
are
laid
out
many
complaints
as
to
the
existing
rail
service.
now
the
commission
on
reconsideration
didn't
say
that
commission-5
was
wrong
as
to
these
findings.
they
simply
said
we
find
that
rail
service
is
adequate
and
(inaudible)
we
deny
the
application.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
i
would
go
so
far
to
say
that
and
that
is
precisely
the
reason
why
rail
counsel
is
correct
when
he
says
we
have
not
challenged
the
commission's
findings
of
fact
because
we
are
implicit
in
their
conclusions
of
law
that
the
existence
of
adequate
rail
service
bars
a
grant
of
motor
carrier
authority.
and
we
say
that
no
matter
how
adequate
the
existing
rail
service
is,
shippers
are
entitled,
as
this
court
held
in
effect
in
the
mclean
case
with
respect
to
water
transportation.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
no
sir
because
if
everybody
is
satisfied
the
carrier
who
comes
in
will
not
have
any
support
to
begin
with.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
basically
that's
it,
but
i
don't
want
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
they
don't
have
to
make
a
case.
as
i
said
earlier
in
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
that
i
think
what
the
commission
may
have
done
here
is
to
confuse
the
element
of
proof
in
a
given
case
with
the
requirements
of
section
207.
now
that's
the
only
other
thing
i
want
to
touch
on.
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
if
he
proves
a
need
for
the
service.
and
all
we
are
saying
is
that
the
question
of
adequacy
is
not
properly
his
burden
as
far
as
the
other
type
of
service
is
concerned.
now
the
other
thing
that
i
want
to
touch
on
here
is
the
argument
of
rail
counsel
confined
almost
entirely
to
section
207
and
his
contention
that
in
effect
the
commission
has
been
given
absolute
discretion
to
determine
in
any
given
case
what
is
pc&n
under
section
207?
well
that
argument
entirely
overlooks
the
provisions
of
the
national
transportation
policy
which
govern
–
which
are
--
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
that
determination
under
207
as
well
as
on
the
other
factor
as
well
as
on
the
other
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
certainly
to
say
that
the
commission
has
been
given
on
limited
discretion
in
the
face
of
language
in
the
national
transportation
policy
which
says
it
shall
positively
preserve
the
inherited
advantages
of
the
motor
transportation
that
just
seem
to
me
to
be
overlooking
the
obvious
meaning
of
(inaudible)
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
i
frankly
don't
know
what
they
mean
except
i
think
they
mean
–-
mr.
peter
t.
beardsley
well,
i
heard
the
phrase
used
in
argument
here
and
i
assume
it
means
that
the
commission
in
effect
has
unlimited
discretion
in
determining
under
a
section
207
application
just
what
meets
the
standards
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
which
i
think
(inaudible)
