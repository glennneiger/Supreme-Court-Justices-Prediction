instead
of
dealing
with
negative
or
with
questions
undermining
negatively
as
it
were
what
the
commission
did,
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
concede
to
be
the
legal
criteria
on
the
basis
of
which
the
commission,
the
legal
criteria
that
the
commission
invoked
on
the
basis
of
which
it
reached
result
of
denial
of
this
certificate
that
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
ultimate
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
doesn't
tell
how
or
what
the
ingredients
are
which
added
up
equal
public
service
either
in
granting
or
denying,
does
it?
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
parts
were
the
governing
considerations
for
denial
which
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
we
talk
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
what,
i
didn't
hear
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that,
would
this
be
redundant,
would
this
be
a
needless
duplication,
is
that
it?
the
message
of
that
it
is,
that
it
would
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is
they
went
on.
we
can't
go
on
the
facts,
but
we
can
go
on
the
basis
on
which
they
judge,
by
which
they
judge
the
facts
and
i'm
trying
to
get
from
you
what
are
the
basis
to
which
the
criteria
which
they
applied
in
reaching
the
result
they
did
and
i
gather
that,
that
underlying
justice
black's
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can't
merely
say,
oh
well,
did
they
go
on
the
grounds
that
he
would
be
a
competitor
to
the
railroad,
the
competitor
would
be
cheaper,
that
the
railroads
need
the
money,
ergo
he's
denied
the
certificate,
that
wouldn't
be
a
sustainable
position,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
lot
of
--
a
jumble
of
words
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
do
i
gather
that
the
commission
makes
a
sharp
break
between
a
certificate
problem
and
rates
and
the
considerations
of
rates
that
are
excluded,
is
that
what
you
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
understand
that,
put
it
that
way,
i
understand
that
if
a
shipper
thinks
the
rates
are
too
high,
he
can
move
in
and
get
them
lowered,
prove
that
they're
reasonable,
but
except
for
the
simple
cases
such
as
a
fellow
wants
a
certificate
because
the
particular
points
aren't
covered,
the
railroad
doesn't
stop
there,
in
plain
english,
or
it
doesn't
stop
at
intervening
point,
and
a
pick
up
motor
traffic
gives
you
that
service
or
because
the
railroad
is
secured,
it's
too
slow
if
that's
possible
(inaudible)
against
swifter
motor
traffic
etcetera,
but
why
isn't
the
quality
of
service
you
get
for
the
competition
you
will
stimulate
by
having
a
carrier,
a
motor
carrier
come
in,
a
relevant
consideration,
wouldn't
that
be
shut
out,
because
as
justice
black
indicates,
i
don't
read
the
statute
to
mean
you
must
have
all
three
and
i
don't
suppose
he
means
that,
but
it
is
indicated
that
on
the
whole
there
should
be
available
as
many
sources
of
transportation
as
possible,
would
you
agree
to
that
general
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
we
get
to
the
question
that
i'm
trying
to
press
you
on
namely
what
are
the
criteria
that
are
thereon
“need?"
if
you
can
--
i
think
there
have
been
cases,
i
remember
cases
where
the
commission
suggested
that
this
would
stimulate,
if
you
get
better
traffic
from
the
railroad
if
you
have
motor
carrier,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
needed
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
let
me
ask
you
this,
have
there
been
cases
before
the
commission,
one
trouble
with
this
whole
problem
is
that
we
get
an
episodic
case
once
in
a
while
and
the
commission
has
oodles
of
cases,
and
so
we
have
to
be
informed
by
you,
have
there
been
cases
where
the
physical
facilities
are
ample,
the
physical
facilities
are
ample
for
the
shippers,
the
rate
that
the
railroad
charges
is
no
motor
carrier,
is
not
deemed
to
be
unreasonable,
shippers
aren't
complaining
about
that
as
such,
but
they
think
that
on
the
whole
if
a
motor
carrier
moves
in,
that
will
by
way
of
competition
lower
the
rates
in
order
to
get
business.
has
the
commission
ever
considered
as
a
relevant
factor
that
the
railroad
would
have
their
revenues
reduced
undesirably
by
just
having
a
competitor
--
competition
from
a
motor
carrier?
does
that
enter
into
the
calculations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
press
you
to
get
down
to
the
irreducible
minimum
in
this
case,
it
isn't
for
want
of
physical,
but
they
don't
claim
that
this
was
needed
to
given
them
physical
facilities
that
they
haven't
had.
they
do
not
have
without
this
carrier,
motor
carrier,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do
not
claim
that
geographically
they
are
not
served,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore
what
is
it,
what
is
it
then
that
the
commission
said
disapproves
need?
if
you
--
i
think
was
it
you
or
was
it
justice
black
who
suggested,
that
you
suggested
that
presumptively
if
there
is
no
motor
carrier
at
all,
if
the
railroad
had
the
monopoly
and
a
trucking
concern
comes
in,
a
motor
carrier
says
we
can
serve
this
territory
in
this
way,
but
that's
a
good
beginning
because
on
the
whole
by
the
transportation
act
or
the
motor
carrier
act,
doesn't
irate
competition
as
such,
the
way
the
sherman
law
did,
it's
rather
contrary
i
should
say,
nevertheless
there
is
an
element
of
promoting
competition
in
the
act,
isn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
in
your
opinion
was
fatal
in
this
case
to
the
existence
of
a
need
having
due
regard
to
the
limited
competitive
policy
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
adequate
physically,
adequate
economically,
adequate
serviceably,
all
three
elements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
got
to
have
some
standard
by
which
the
correct
conclusion
on
the
fact
is
to
be
judged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
crux
of
the
case
so
far
as
our
reviewing
authority
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
fact
that
it
isn't
urged
as
evident
to
sustain
the
finding,
isn't
that
true?
you're
urging
that
this
doesn't
raise
the
question
of
adequacy
of
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
being
so
it's
all
the
more
incumbent
i
take
it
for
the
appellees
to
satisfy
this
court
that
the
commission
adopted
the
right
criteria
with
the
reference
to
which
it
adjudged
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
rates
are
relevant
to
this
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
rates
are
irrelevant
what
were
the
considerations,
the
shipper's
point
of
view
of
having
this
service
unless
the
record
discloses
that
the
railroad
are
not
--
transportation
is
taken
care
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
suppose
if
it
is
a
question
of
division
5
of
the
whole
commission
on
those
items
of
inadequacy,
isn't
that
a
question
of
fact
on
which
unless
it
is
taken
out
of
the
thin
air,
this
commission
--
this
court
is
bound
by
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
another
form
of
transportation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
there
is
an
adequate
rail
service,
but
a
carrier
comes
in
and
says
i
am
going
to
give
the
same
service,
everybody
is
satisfied
–
i'm
not
saying
that
this
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
because
it's
a
competing
service
they
must
grant
them
a
certificate,
is
that
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
question
of
facts
but
i
am
–
division
5
said
there
are
inadequacies,
the
commission
overruled
them,
you
say
we
can't
reveal
that
and
therefore
we
must
take
it
on
the
assumption
that
commission
found
there
was
adequacy.
now
what
is
left
is
the
legal
proposition
that
a
motor
carrier
came
in
and
said
i
wanted
to
compete
with
adequate
rail
service,
and
you
say,
they
must
grant
it
because
if
the
general
interest
of
competition,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
want
to
–
if
you
–
does
that
mean
that
--
if
that
means
that
the
report
of
the
commission
is
so
obscure
that
we
can't
tell
the
ground
on
which
they
were,
if
that's
the
issue
you
are
tipping,
i
understand
that
too.
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
as
i
thought
you
indicated,
and
i
can
understand
that
too,
i
just
want
to
know
that
although
the
commission
found
as
a
non
reviewable
facts
here
were
no
inadequacy
the
rail
service
because
it
is
a
carrier
and
thereafter
it
competes
with
all
the
potentialities
of
competition,
they
must
give
them
the
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
commission
can
contend
--
unlimited
discretion
means
non-reviewable,
is
that
what
you
mean
by
unlimited?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
claim
unlimited,
where
do
they
say
it's
a
unlimited
discretion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
not
an
arguable
question
myself
that
have
unlimited
discretion?
