justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
depend
on
what
--
how
you
construe
intercept?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
that
depend
upon
how
you
construe
intercept?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
that
the
chap
listening
in
on
the
extension
was
intercepting
the
message,
that's
the
very
question
we
have
to
decide,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
do
you
mean
by
that
that
given
its
dictionary
definition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
would
mean
a
message
which
never
got
to
the
receiver
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
somehow
was
arrested
in
passage
before
it
was
--
reached
the
receiver.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
the
sense
in
which
the
congress
used
the
word?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
is
it
really?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
you're
speaking
now
electronically
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
doesn't
a
tap
have
to
be
added?
it's
not
part
of
the
set
as
installed,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
that's
a
very
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
a
great
difference
in
the
fact
that
the
extension
is
part
of
the
installation
as
you
get
it,
isn't
it?
they're
not
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
(inaudible)
wasn't
that
held
actually
that
this
is
no
different
than
the
secretary
thing
and
not
a
square
holding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
the
situation
is
much
like
this,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
interception
listening
on
the
extension
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
any
more
than
it
would
have
been
in
the
secretary
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
will
we
have
to
do
with
goldman
to
accept
your
suggestion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
congressional
history
which
supports
the
notion
an
interceptor
was
used
in
the
--
some
connotation
of
eavesdropping?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
covered
in
the
brief
by
chance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
rationale,
would
be,
mr.
davis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
rationale
in
the
second
and
the
district
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
would
be
the
case
if
listening
in
on
the
extension
was
not
known
to
either
of
the
parties
for
this
telephone
call?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
mr.
davis,
we
use
one
of
these
devices
that
mr.
hudson
described
for
us
that
you
may
lay
alongside
as
i
understand
with
the
telephone
line
without
any
attachment
and
in
that
way
get
the
message
that's
going
over
the
line.
would
that
be
an
interference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
listening
in
on
a
party
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
lot
of
people
go
to
jail
and
whoever.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
then
that
that's
in
your
position
would
be,
one
make
use
of
the
telephone
system
itself
to
listen
in
on
a
conversation
such
as
was
done
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
constitutes
the
interception.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
then
whether
it's
one
of
these
fancy
mechanical
devices
or
listening
in
on
an
extension
or
hopping
in
or
anything
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you've
distinguished
goldman
and
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
detectaphone
