chief
justice
earl

what
was
that,
i
didn't
get
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
who
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
for
him
to
make
a
recording
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
anybody
who
has
called
up
can
make
a
recording
of
the
conversation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
this
man
--
suppose
the
--
the
question
that
come
up
in
court,
rathbun
had
testified
to
what
happened
--
what
occurred
to
this
conversation
over
the
phone,
and
sparks
had
testified
to
the
opposite.
and
sparks
had
brought
a
recording
in
to
corroborate
him.
would
you
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
isn't
that
all
that
is
being
done
here,
the
policemen
are
corroborating
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
sparks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you're
working
for
a
company
could
--
if
she
was
working
for
a
company
could
she
give
it
to
her
employers
without
violating
the
law
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
it
different?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
in
this
are
they
different?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hudson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
oh,
yes
--
yes
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
in
recent
years,
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
law
require
when
there's
a
recording
on
one
end
of
the
phone
to
--
to
ring
a
little
bell
every
few
seconds?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
that
is
true,
isn't
that
a
--
the
recognition
on
the
part
of
congress
that
it
didn't
intend
this
act
to
forbid
such
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
in
--
on
the
contrary,
wouldn't
it
--
wouldn't
it
be
a
recognition
at
least
on
--
on
the
part
of
the
commission
that
--
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
considered
wire-tapping
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
came
into
being
after
the
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
decide
it
on
that
ground
wouldn't
resolve
any
conflict,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
mr.
hudson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
hudson,
i
have
sat
in
offices
almost
as
far
as
i
am
from
you
and
couldn't
avoid
hearing
the
telephone
conversation,
not
only
one
on
this
end
of
it
but
--
but
the
--
the
instrument
was
so
attuned
that
you
just
couldn't
help
hearing
it
in
--
in
much
of
the
room.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
i
should
--
if
i
should
be
human
enough
to
disclose
that
conversation,
would
i
be
in
violation
of
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't,
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
