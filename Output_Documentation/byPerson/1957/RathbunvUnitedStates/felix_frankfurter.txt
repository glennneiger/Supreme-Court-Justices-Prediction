justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
unless
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
divulges,
yes,
divulge
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
secretary
case
come
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
she
testify?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
a
telephone
from
one
room
and
to
what
we
call
an
extension.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
call
that
if
it's
put
on
by
someone
else
and
is
interference
with
the
--
with
the
transmission
system,
why
is
that
an
interference
if
you
installed
a
mechanical
thing
for
future
use,
why
is
that
an
interference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
--
i
know.
i
understand,
what
that
means,
the
integrity
of
the
circuit
but
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
to
solved
whether
this
is
an
interference
with
integrity.
is
this
some
--
i'm
saying
here
is
about
electronics,
is
this
–
is
--
is
this
--
was
what
was
done
here
–
what
i
suggest,
if
somebody
else
put
this
in
for
future
availability,
is
that
an
interference,
although
it
isn't
used
until
the
time
comes,
hardly
an
interference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is,
until
it's
used,
it
doesn't
come
within
605
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
that
time,
the
--
they
enter
--
and
that
time,
if
it
comes
within
605,
it's
because
of
the
unauthorization
of
the
hearing
at
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
unauthorization
of
that
hearing
and
the
unauthorization
of
this
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
section
says.
relating
back
is
something
i'm
very
suspicious
of
with
the
law
usually.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
help
us
on
605.
i
mean,
just
–
but
the
opposite
case
doesn't
shed
any
light
for
our
problem
that
would
accept
the
use
that
you
made
it,
that
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
light
does
it
shed
as
to
the
evil
they
wanted
to
stop.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
it
would
make
no
difference
if
a
calls
or
b
between
free
businessmen,
if
you
please,
two
lawyers.
and
a
says
to
b,
(inaudible)
very
confidential
in
communicating
to
you.
i
know
your
secretary
has
an
extension
and
listening
in,
i
ask
you
not
to
allow
the
listening
on
this
particular
communication.
do
you
think
that
would
present
the
same
case
as
the
accepted
cause
of
conduct
between
the
–
between
principals
and
secretaries
is
now
being
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
is
that
an
extravagant
assumption
in
the
custom
of
our
day
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
practices
of
our
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
lets
it's
taken
for
granted.
i
don't
need
to
say
it
but
it's
something
that's
the
common
practice
--
it
--
it
doesn't
need
for
me
to
be
called
artificially
an
acceptance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
between.
and
from
acceptance
to
consent
isn't
a
far
stretch.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
whether
this
case
satisfies
the
characterization
of
judge
hand
in
reitmeister,
the
reitmeister
that
don't
mean
to
accept
that.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
--
but
it
must
be
the
--
the
--
and
if
there
must
be
the
interjection
of
an
independent
receiving
device
between
the
lips
of
the
sender
and
the
ear
of
the
receiver,
to
that
is
--
would
this
be
interjection
of
an
independent
receiving
device?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
grant
have
to
be
modified
or
could
we
take
it
up
within
the
grant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
can
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
troubled
about
that.
i'm
troubled
but
seriously
about
that
mr.
davis,
if
the
record
and
can
we
say
that
the
record
persuasively
spells
consent
and
then
the
court
will
go
beyond
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
this
is
here
--
suppose
that
--
suppose
if
that
--
if
that's
so,
maybe
desirable
to
resolve
conflict
among
number
of
jurisdiction,
maybe
it
isn't.
that's
all
i
want
to
know
whether
he's
--
whether
we
can
or
should
what
we
can
do
or
should
do.
i
want
to
know
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
(inaudible)
interpretation
of
what
the
record
permits
one
to
find
on
this
subject
of
consent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
has
the
lower
court
ruled
against
it
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
didn't
the
lower
court
deal
with
it
because
they're
like
lawyers
and
judges
like
broader
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
hope
you'd
say
that
it
would
do
no
harm
to
restrict
some
of
the
offices
of
some
of
the
government
officers.
