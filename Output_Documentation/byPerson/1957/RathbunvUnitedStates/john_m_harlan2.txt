justice
john
m.
harlan
was
it
a
regular
extension?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
put
in
for
that
purpose?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
might
be
a
divulgence
but
not
a
divulgence
of
an
intercept
in
the
court,
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
interception.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
supposing
you're
in
your
office,
you're
called
by
a
business
acquaintance
and
you
tell
your
secretary
without
saying
anything
to
the
sender
of
the
message,
i'd
like
to
have
you
pick
up
your
extension
take
down
our
conversation,
is
she
committing
a
crime?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
she
committing
a
crime
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
she
divulges
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
she
may
testify
if
she
was
subpoenaed,
too.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
her
duty
to
testify
if
she's
subpoenaed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
this
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
don't
do
anything
by
way
of
a
device,
you
just
go
and
hide
under
the
couch
and
the
recipient
of
the
conversation
is
talking
in
response
to
the
conversation
and
he
holds
the
receiver
a
little
away
from
the
ear
so
you
can
hear
what's
coming
through,
is
that
an
interception?
under
your
definition
of
listening
in,
i
suppose
it
would
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
just
devise
it
by
getting
under
a
couch
and
listen
with
your
ears.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
eavesdropping
was
the
essence
of
this
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
i
know
you
argue
it
but
do
you
really
place
any
reliance
on
your
--
on
its
opposition
that
there
was
a
consent
by
rathbun.
but
i
know
it's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
atmospheric
and
so
forth
but
do
you
think
it's
sound?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
case
of
that
ground,
you
don't
want
to
miss
it
but
you'd
rather
have
a
decision
here
that
was
in
favor
of.
