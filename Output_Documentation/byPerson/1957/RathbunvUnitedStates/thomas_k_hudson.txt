mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
please.
this
matter
comes
before
this
court
by
certiorari
from
the
tenth
circuit.
a
short
history
of
the
situation
is,
that
in
april
of
1955,
rathbun
was
indicted
on
two
counts
charging
that
he
knowingly
transmitted
an
interstate
commerce
communication
containing
a
threat
to
injure
which
is
a
violation
of
section
18
united
states
code,
paragraph
875
(b)
and
(c),
(b)
is
the
threat
to
injure
or
kill
for
the
purpose
of
extortion
and
(c)
is
the
threat
to
injury
or
kill.
i
went
to
trial
in
denver
and
rathbun
was
convicted
by
this
jury.
and
the
court,
in
sentencing
him,
gave
him
one
year
and
a
day
on
each
count
to
be
served
concurrently
and
a
fine
of
$1000
on
one
fine.
that
matter
was
appealed
to
our
circuit
court,
in
denver,
which
is
our
tenth
circuit,
and
the
conviction
was
sustained.
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
a
limited
situation.
the
certiorari
which
is
here
and
which
is
confined
to
a
telephone
extension,
and
if
the
court
will
pardon
me,
i'd
like
to
read
what
my
problem
is,
is
the
listening
in
by
a
third
person
on
an
extension
telephone
without
consent
of
the
sender
and
interception
within
the
meaning
of
section
605,
title
47,
u.s.c.a,
and
the
admission
in
the
evidence
of
testimony
of
said
third
person
relating
to
the
contents
of
the
conversion
i.e.divulgence
of
such
intercepted
communication
and
thus
prohibited
by
the
aforesaid
statute.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are,
shortly,
that
mr.
rathbun
was
in
new
york
city
and
he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
business
dealings
with
sparks,
the
complaining
witness.
and
rathbun
called
sparks
from
new
york
city
to
pueblo,
colorado
by
long
distance
telephone
about
1
o'clock
in
the
morning.
sparks
held
some
securities
which
belonged
to
rathbun
and
rathbun
desired
to
have
those
released.
there
had
been
three
conversations
previously
and
rathbun
had
an
appointment
call
with
sparks
from
1
o'clock
in
the
morning.
sparks
called
two
police
officers
of
the
pueblo
police
force
and
asked
them
to
be
present
at
his
home.
and
they
were
present
there,
and
at
the
time
the
call
came
in,
mr.
sparks
answered
the
call
on
the
main
line
and
the
two
officers,
that
was
in
the
sparks'
living
room,
the
two
officers
were
in
the
dining
room
on
an
extension
phone
with
the
phone
between
their
heads
listening
to
the
conversation.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
sir.
no,
it
was
regularly
installed
in
the
home
there
and
it
was
not
especially
for
that
purpose
at
all.
it
is
that
testimony
to
which
i've
objected
at
the
time
of
trial
and
judge
now
so
ruled
the
objection
and
the
testimony
was
permitted.
and
that
is
the
error
and
one
of
the
errors
which
we
cite
in
our
petition
of
certiorari
and
that
is
a
situation
which
brings
this
matter
before
this
court
and
limits
it
to
an
extension
phone.
and
there's
--
i
believe,
there's
nothing
else
that
i
am
permitted
to
go
into
in
connection
with
this
matter
except
that
one
specific
question.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
to
take
into
consideration
in
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute.
there
are
only
a
few
words
in
this
particular
statute
that
are
of
any
particular
importance
that
is,
they're
all
important
but
i
have
--
i
mean,
it
need
determination.
i
believe
we
have
to
have
an
authorization
here
before
anyone
can
listen
in
on
a
phone
and
divulge
its
content.
there
was
no
authorization
by
rathbun
to
sparks,
however,
rathbun
did
remark
to
sparks
over
the
phone
as
the
record
will
show,
i
don't
care
if
you
are
making
a
recording
of
this.
that
is
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
he
made
the
remark,
"i
don't
care
if
you
are
making
a
recording
of
this
conversation."
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
rathbun
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
--
said
that
to
sparks.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
you
are
correct,
yes
sir.
now,
the
statement
was
made
from
rathbun
to
sparks,
not
to
rathbun
to
sparks
saying,
“i
don't
care
if
you've
got
people
listening
in
on
this
phone.”
he
said,
“i
don't
care
if
you
make
or
if
you're
making
a
recording.”
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
well,
quite
a
bit.
you
might
make
a
recording
from
the
purpose
of
memory.
but
for
people
to
listen
in
upon
your
phone,
that
is
forbidden
by
the
statute
and
we
have
a
statute
that
we're
referring
to
here.
now,
the
statute
does
not
say
anything
about
not
making
a
recording,
your
honor.
the
statute
says
that
no
one
unauthorized
shall
intercept
a
telephone
message
and
divulge
it.
the
--
there
is
nothing,
as
far
as
i
know,
that's
illegal
about
someone
making
a
recording
of
the
conversation.
there
is
something
illegal
so
far
as
this
particular
statute
is
concerned
there.
there
is
something
illegal
if
i
think
that
i
am
talking
with
john
doe
only
and
other
people
are
listening
in
or
intercepting
this
message.
section
605
make
that
illegal
if
they
attempt
to
divulge
it.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
sir?
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
well,
i've
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
believe
that
is
correct,
sir.
that's
a
question
of
interception.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
so
far
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
--
yes,
sir,
limiting
it
to
605.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
section
605?
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
sir
not
of
605.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
--
i
think
that
under
many
circumstances,
i
could
think
up
a
lot
of
objections
to
the
introduction
of
the
recorded
instrument.
but
605
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
don't
believe
so,
not
if
--
not
if
i
was
the
only
one
listening
to
the
conversation
and
i
came
over
the
phone,
i
believe
that
that
would
not
be,
at
least,
i
don't
think
it
be
a
--
a
violation
of
section
605.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
it
is
--
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
is
not
objectionable.
if
it
were
not
objectionable,
it's
--
it's
merely
a
case
of
refreshment
of
memory.
in
other
words,
i
might
sit
there
and
make
notes
of
the
conversation.
i
might
record
it.
now,
whether
or
not
that
record
could
be
introduced
in
evidence,
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
in
to
that.
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
divulgence,
no,
sir.
i
think
it
be
a
matter
of
a
recorded
conversation
if
it
could
come
in.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
the
--
the
word
intercept
as
used
in
this
particular
statute
is
probably
unfortunate
and
there
has
never
been
a
case
decided
that
i
know
of
where
the
accepted
dictionary
definition
of
intercept
has
been
followed.
intercept
pursuant
to
the
late
dictionaries
and
the
old
one
as
far
as
that
goes
means
a
stoppage,
like
you
intercept
a
forward
pass,
you
stop
it.
it
does
not
mean
that
you
listen
in.
the
--
it's
--
it's
a
stoppage
either
in
a
communication.
it's
a
stoppage
in
the
connection.
it's
a
stoppage
of
something
but
it
does
not
go
past
the
interception,
anymore
than
football
does.
that
isn't
what
was
intended
here.
i
think
that
what
was
intended
here
by
the
congress
and
what
the
cases
are,
if
touching,
is
that
you
shall
not
listen
in,
you
shall
not
eavesdrop
more
than
the
word
intercept.
i'm
--
i'm
not
impressed
with
the
--
with
the
word
intercept
be,
what
the
congress
intended
to
use.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
sir.
they're
all,
i
believe,
receivers
and
senders.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
our
circuit
court
found
that
rathbun
instigated
the
call
and
he
was
the
sender
and
--
but
either
way,
it
would
be
the
same
because
i
believe
the
case
has
hold
that
they
are
by
phone,
one
is
a
sender
and
then
a
receiver.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no
--
yes.
that
is
correct
and
that
was
on
the
extension
phone
as
far
as
that
goes.
and
that
was
an
interception,
judge.
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
that
it
was
all
right
as
i
recall.
you
see,
i
don't
believe
that
pursuant
to
this
section,
you
can
listen
in
whether
it's
on
the
extension
phone
or
otherwise,
without
the
consent
of
both
parties.
i
believe
that
the
privacy
of
the
communication
must
be
maintained.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
think
that's
correct.
now,
i
don't
think
that
the
consent
that
i
spoke
to
which
the
government
will
bring
up,
constitutes
the
consent
to
say
i
don't
care
if
you've
got
four
people
listening.
i
think
that's
entirely
different.
the
matter
of
interception
is
a
rather
impossible
word
and
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
sir?
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
it
is
the
word
used
but
i
mean
it's
rather
impossible
of
interpretation
in
connection
with
this
statute,
judge.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
it
won't
work.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
feel
sure
of
that.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
believe
that
they
do.
now,
there's
another
thing
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
and
there
was
--
no
one
knew
the
tap
was
on
or
at
least
one
person
didn't
know.
now,
the
only
difference
between
a
telephone
tap
and
a
conventional
phone
or
rather
a
conventional
extension
is
that
your
tap
has
headsets
and
not
a
mouthpiece
otherwise
they're
the
same
identical
thing.
and
the
unfortunate
part
of
it
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
oh,
sure.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
yes,
of
a
tap.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
oh,
of
course,
not.
but
i
mean
a
wiretap
phone
is
the
same
as
an
extension
phone
except
it
doesn't
have
a
mouthpiece.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
sir?
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
oh,
yes,
that
is
correct.
however,
an
extension
--
all
of
these
phones
are
the
same.
they
come
in
to
a
connection
box
and
they're
all
hooked
on
to
the
same
screws
and
they
are
heard
frankly
simultaneously.
now,
the
reason
that
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
not
unless
she
divulges
it.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
she
divulges
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
--
the
information.
sir?
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
oh,
i
think
so.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
oh,
yes.
that
is
under
the
circumstance
i
think
if
she
can
tell
me
about
it
because
i
asked
her
to
make
a
record
of
it.
but
if
she
goes
into
a
courtroom
or
something
like
that,
i
don't
believe
that
she
can
divulge
that
to
anyone
else
without
the
consent
of
the
sender.
now,
there
is
one
circumstance
that
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
i
think
very
definitely
because
that's
one
of
her
duties.
in
other
words,
she's
employed.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
sir?
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
not
under
605.
it
then
becomes
objectionable
unless
i
was
advised
that
this
was
being
recorded
by
a
stenographer.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
don't
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
oh
no,
not
at
all.
not
if
the
corporate
employer
asked
her
to
make
a
record
of
the
telephone
conversation.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
sir.
now
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
sir?
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
well,
the
--
in
this
case,
the
two
officers
listening
were
allowed
to
testify.
in
the
secretary
case,
she
tells
me
or
she
makes
a
--
a
transcript
to
what
she
took
down.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
divulgence.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
sir.
not
under
605.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
think
that's
correct
that
the
--
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
a
secretary
taking
it
down.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
think
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
that's
because
of
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
that's
because
on
the
extension.
now,
the
--
the
courts
have
been
hitting
around
what
is
an
interception
and
what
do
you
have
to
do
to
make
an
interception.
i'd
like
to
bring
out
the
time
element
in
the
electronics
of
this
and
i
believe
that
we
can
understand
why
you
can't
have
an
interception.
because
they've
gone
on
--
that
some
of
the
courts
have
gone
on
the
theory
that
the
wiretap
hears
it
first,
whereas,
the
extension
doesn't.
now,
factually,
electricity
on
a
microwave
which
it
would
be
going
from
new
york
to
denver,
colorado,
travels
with
a
speed
of
light,
that's
186,000
feet
a
second.
it
goes
from
denver
to
pueblo
over
a
cable.
that
travels
then
from
50,000
to
100,000
miles
a
second.
the
transmission
time
of
a
message
from
denver
to
pueblo
using
the
microwave
is
about
1375th
of
a
second.
possible
a
measurement
but
we
wouldn't
recognize
in
the
human
ear
certainly.
now,
we
get
it
down
to
this
home
in
pueblo
where
the
main
line
is
in
the
living
room,
the
extension
is
in
the
dining
room.
now,
if
they
were
a
hundred
feet
apart,
the
time
element
would
be
three-billionths
of
a
second
different.
now,
in
the
average
home
they
aren't
going
to
be
that
far
apart.
they'd
be
20
feet
apart.
it
gets
to
be
one-billionth
of
a
second.
it
is
not
possible
a
measurement.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
an
extension
that
someone
is
listening
to
who
is
not
authorized
or
there's
a
tap
been
on
the
wire.
everybody
hears
at
the
same
time.
i
don't
hear
it
before
john
doe
hears
it.
we
all
hear
it
at
the
same
identical
time
because
you
can't
figure
billionths
of
a
second.
that
is,
a
human
ear
cannot
figure
it.
the
--
now,
there's
another
misfortune
about
the
wiretap
and
it
refers
to
it
in
one
of
the
hearings
that
were
held
in
the
legislative
hearing.
they
now
have
a
device
that
you
can
set
alongside
of
a
telephone
wire
with
no
attachment
that
is
so
sensitive
that
it
picks
up
the
sound.
in
that
case,
you
have
no
wiretap
at
all.
now,
i
believe
that
what
the
congress
meant
and
i
believe
that
it
needs
the
onstruction
that
it
doesn't
mean
interception
that
means
that
you
shan't
listen
in,
you
shall
not
eavesdrop
unless
everyone
is
advised
of,
in
the
event
you're
not
advised
of
it,
you
cannot
testify
relative
to
that
because
a
violation
of
605.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
well,
the
goldman
case
--
i'm
up
against
this,
your
honor.
these
cases
are
all
mixed
up.
there
--
there
is
no
controlling
law
and
i
--
i
believe
that
this
court
in
deciding
this
particular
case,
i
think
that
it's
going
to
make
some
new
law.
i
believe
that
it's
going
to
take
a
different
concept
of
it.
i
believe
it's
something
that
needs
clarification
and
this
clarification
is
invariably
for
this
reason
that
in
deciding
a
case
such
as
this,
it
might
be
that
the
--
the
court
would
give
a
blueprint
to
a
violator.
in
other
words,
if
i
can
get
in
and
listen
on
an
extension,
i
have
committed
no
crime.
but
if
i
put
a
wiretap
in
somewhere,
i
have
committed
a
crime.
consequently,
if
i
want
to
listen
in
on
these
conversations,
if
i
won't
--
somebody
wants
me
to
listen
in
on
the
conversation,
all
they've
got
to
do
is
to
put
me
on
the
extension
phone.
i
can
go
in
and
testify
at
any
time.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
in
other
words,
if
they
devised
a
way
for
me
to
listen.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
well,
but
in
that
case,
there's
--
in
this
case,
there's
nothing
surreptitious
about
it
judge
i
think
this.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
no,
no.
if
i
gave
that
impression
--
well,
i've
given
an
erroneous
impression.
i
--
it's
called
a
wiretapping
but
the
listening
in
or
an
unfortunate
word
on
my
part,
eavesdropping
in
possibly
would
be
wrong.
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
the
actual
listening
to
a
conversation
without
authorization,
then
wanted
to
testify
to,
it
is
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
the
--
yes.
and
i
--
i
made
some
notes
on
that
to
be
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
--
to
be
brutally
frank
judge,
this
particular
section
in
the
communications
act
had
beentreated
kind
of
like
a
stepchild.
they've
been
interested
more
in
other
things.
but
in
a
hearing
before
the
committee
on
expenditures
and
the
executive
departments
of
the
house
of
representatives
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
sir.
i
looked
this
up
after
i
came
to
washington.
we
don't
have
the
congressional
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
--
records
out
in
denver.
it
is
under
the
heading
of
wiretapping
and
law
enforcement.
it's
the
71st
congress,
the
third
session
and
it
was
held
on
february
19th,
1931
that
was
subsequent
prior
to
the
fashioning
of
this
act.
this
is
william
d.
mitchell,
the
attorney
general
that
is
talking
this
time.
and
on
page
24
of
that
particular
work,
it
says
if
i
may
read
to
your
honor.
“of
course,
the
question
of
wiretapping
is
a
broad
one.
it
involves
a
general
question
of
what
you
might
call
eavesdropping.”
and
at
page
--
on
the
same
page,
the
attorney
general
says,
"they
tell
me
there's
a
device
now
in
coarse
development
by
which
you
do
not
have
to
tap
the
wire
at
all,
which
you
can
set
up
the
apparatus
in
the
vicinity
of
the
telephone
wire
and
catch
the
message
in
that
way
without
any
physical
contact
at
all."
mr.
(inaudible),
if
that
is
the
way
the
name
was
pronounced
was
a
member
of
that
committee
and
he
asked
the
question,
"that
would
be
a
tapping
just
the
same.
mr.
mitchell:
-
"yes,
but
it
has
no
physical
connection."
mr.
(inaudible):
"it
would
be
done
without
any
physical
connection
but
it
would
be
the
interception
of
the
message
just
the
same."
now,
there
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i
believe
that
i
have
about
five
minutes
left
and
i'd
like
to
hold
that
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
the
court
--
chief
justice
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
--
if
the
court
please.
you
know
it's
my
conception
that
telephone
conversations
do
have
a
confidential
status
as
between
the
two
individuals
talking.
we
assume
that
a
is
talking
to
b,
period.
and
a
is
not
talking
to
b,
c,
d
and
e
and
if
he
is
talking
to
c,
d
and
e
in
addition
to
b,
he's
entitled
to
be
advised.
that
doesn't
make
any
particular
difference
what
vehicle
is
used
to
connect
the
ears
up.
now,
we
can
use
a
play
on
words
and
we
can
have
extension
to
wiretaps
or
what
have
you.
they're
all
the
same
net
result.
congress
never
passed
an
act
that
should
be
made
a
nullity
by
a
play
on
words.
they
never
passed
an
act
that
was
supposed
to
become
a
nullity
on
one-billionth
of
a
second.
we
have
a
principle
involved
here
that
the
privacy
of
communication
and
we're
entitled
to
have
protected.
if
i
cannot
call
anyone
in
these
good
united
states
and
talk
to
them
with
freedom,
then
the
complete
foundation
of
communication
is
broken
down.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
well,
i
don't
believe
i'd
be
too
disturbed
about
calling
one
but
i
think
that
the
government
office
would
violate
605.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
if
your
honor
please,
i
couldn't
say
that
they
--
if
there
was
a
listening
of
that
government
office
and
i
was
not
advised
of
it,
and
they
attempt
to
divulge
it,
it
would
be
a
violation
to
section
605
in
my
opinion.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
i've
done
the
same
thing
judge.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
no,
not
at
all,
because
you
didn't
do
anything
to
intercept
the
call,
judge.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
it's
a
--
i
have
--
had
the
same
experience.
you
hear
that
one
–-
both
voices
all
over
the
room.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
but
that's
one
of
those
unavoidable
things.
but
it
is
not
an
interception
as
is
thought
of
in
section
605.
as
i
have
said,
the
word
interception
is
an
unfortunate
thing.
there
might
have
been
better
words
to
be
used
but
there
has
never
been
a
case
decided
in
these
good
united
states
that
interpret
interception
following
a
dictionary
and
we've
got
a
rule
of
law
that
is
very,
very
long
that
says
words
should
be
given
their
normal
meaning.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
it
very
--
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
yes,
sir.
it
very
well
could
be.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
not
at
all.
just
as
long
as
you
do
not
advice
me
that
a,
b
and
c
are
listening
in
also.
i'm
entitled
to
carry
on
my
discussion
between
myself
and
you
with
perfect
freedom
and
not
have
that
privacy
interfered
with.
mr.
thomas
k.
hudson
that
was
detectaphone
hanging
on
the
wall
and
is
--
is
entirely
different.
the
tenth
circuit
judge
wrote
that
and
i
forget
who
it
was,
it
might
have
been
hogsman.
he
said
that
it
would
depend
on
the
position
of
the
extension,
how
it
was
installed.
well,
it
can't
make
any
difference
because
you've
got
a
billionth
of
a
second
in
there
and
we
never
thought
about
that.
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
