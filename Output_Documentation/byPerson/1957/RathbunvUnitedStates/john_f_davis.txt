mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
please.
in
the
original
wire-tapping
cases,
olmstead
and
nardone,
this
court
was
dealing
with
wire-tapping
in
the
sense
of
an
actual
interference
with
the
electrical
circuit,
either
by
means
of
attaching
wires
to
that
circuit
or
by
means
of
induction.
the
question,
here,
is
whether
the
same
rules
apply
when
an
extension
telephone
is
used.
here,
the
petitioner
made
a
call
from
new
york
city
to
a
certain
station
in
pueblo,
colorado.
the
call
was
completed
just
as
was
intended.
it
was
received
in
pueblo
on
the
regularly
installed
instruments
at
the
station
which
was
called.
and
it
was
at
that
station
that
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
parties
to
the
conversation,
the
two
police
officers
listened
to
the
conversation.
i
think
one
thing
is
clear
in
this
field
of
interception
and
that
is,
that
the
contents
of
a
telephone
message
do
not
acquire
a
confidential
status
merely
because
the
message
is
transmitted
over
the
telephone.
either
party
to
the
conversation,
for
example,
may
disclose
the
contents
of
that
conversation
to
a
third
party.
and
the
holding
of
the
goldman
case
was
that
a
third
party
could
eavesdrop
at
the
commencement
of
the
conversation
and
as
long
as
he
didn't
interfere
with
the
actual
means
of
transmission,
he
could
disclose
what
he
heard.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
situation
where,
mr.
sparks,
in
colorado,
can
hold
the
telephone
a
few
inches
away
from
his
ear
so
that
someone
can
overhear
what
has
been
said
and
where
he
requests
the
officers
to
step
into
the
next
room
and
listen
in
on
the
regularly
installed
telephone
instrument.
but
that
is
the
question
--
that
is
really
the
question
which
is
before
this
court.
we
urge
that
congress
was
intending
to
protect
the
integrity
of
this
particular
means
of
communication.
there
is
little
or
no
legislative
history
relative
to
605
which
aids
us
in
determining,
specifically,
what
congress
intended.
but
we
do
know
that
they
legislated
with
the
olmstead
case
in
the
background.
we
know
that
there
had
been
before
they
legislated
the
extensive
use
of
wire-tapping
in
the
sense
of
surreptitious
attaching
of
wiretaps
in
connection
with
the
enforcement
of
the
prohibition
act.
the
congress
had
outlawed
the
use
of
funds
for
enforcing
prohibition.
so
it's
in
this
climate
that
congress
passed
this
act
which
forbids
the
interception
and
divulgence
of
telephone
messages.
and
the
specific
question
is,
of
course,
is
this
an
interception.
this
court
has
never
passed
on
it.
the
nearest
the
court
has
come
to
passing
on
this
particular
question
is
the
goldman
case
which
it
--
its
reasoning
be
applied
here.
we
think
it
shows
that
there
was
no
interception
here.
the
lower
--
the
–
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
it
before
them
on
several
occasions
and
they
are
split.
the
second
circuit,
and
not
quite
so
clearly,
but
probably
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
court
of
columbia
circuit,
have
both
held
that
this
is
an
interception
when
a
person
listens
on
an
extension
phone
with
the
consent
of
one
of
the
parties.
the
sixth
and
the
seventh
circuit
and
some
of
the
--
and
some
of
the
district
courts
have
held
to
the
contrary
and
their
view
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
say
that
an
interception
is
--
is
in
effect
the
eavesdropping
on
the
--
on
the
conversation
and
that
this
is
eavesdropping
on
the
conversation.
the
sixth
circuit,
i
think
the
reasoning
and
the
plan
of
this
case
is
--
is
pretty
clear
which
holds
against
the
interception
and
they
say
that
it
is
not
an
interception
because
the
message
begins
at
the
place
it
was
intended
to
begin
perhaps
and
continues
uninterruptedly
to
the
place
where
it
was
supposed
to
be
received
and
there
someone
listens
and
they
say,
"this
is
not
an
interception."
the
--
the
communication
is
completed
as
intended.
our
rational
which
--
rationale
which
we
propose
for
the
court
is
that
an
interception
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
an
interference
with
this
method
of
communication
and
that
there
–
there
is
in
this
case,
no
interference
with
the
method
of
communication
but
rather
the
use
of
it
as
it
was
intended
to
be
used.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
the
--
the
message
itself
as
we
say
is
--
doesn't
get
a
confidential
status.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
on
--
on
the
theory
which
i
have
proposed,
if
it
were
done
on
a
regularly
installed
extension
phone
or
on
a
party
line,
there
would
be
no
interference
with
the
means
of
communication
and
this
would,
again,
not
be
an
interception.
i
think
we
have
a
stronger
case
here
where
there
is
consent
by
one
of
the
parties.
it
has
a
--
it
has
a--
a
better
appearance
but
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
argue
that
there
was
consent
to
--
to
this
listening.
mr.
john
f.
davis
then
i
would
say
there
was
an
interception.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes,
there
would
then
be
an
interference
with
the
telephone
circuit.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
if
they
had
put
it
on,
it
would
have
been
–-
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
against
the
fact.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
that
would
be
what
--
in
the
sense
of
olmstead
and
nardone
--
is
wire-tapping
and
you
would
need
consent
of
both
parties
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
is
not
put
on
in
the
--
in
the
regular
cost
of
the
telephone
business
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
if
it
was
put
on
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
hearing
messages
which
comes
--
which
come
over
them
--
over
the
system,
then
the
--
in
fact
i
may
call
as
the
integrity
of
the
circuit.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
broken.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
isn't
--
if
it's
not
installed
under
authority
of
the
--
of
the
telephone
company
of
the
--
of
the
utility
that's
involved,
then
it
is
the
same
as
i
--
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
same
as
though
one
runs
a
wire
into
an
electrical
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
that
is
true.
it
doesn't
--
that's
right.
there
is
no
interception
until
--
until
there
is
some
agency
which
--
which
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
records
in
some
way
what
goes
over.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
true.
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
must
relate
back
to
--
to
the
method
which
is
used
to
--
to
accomplish
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
same.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
the
section
says
interception
as
such.
and
the
question
is,
is
there
an
--
i
read
interception
as
interference.
and
the
question
is,
has
there
been
in
that
--
that
case
any
interference.
and
as
--
as
mr.
hudson
points
out,
we
can't
have
interference
from
the
sense
of
stopping
--
stopping
the
message
from
going
at
--
entirely
because
the
whole
history
of
this
--
they
don't
stop
it.
they
--
they
just
tap
off.
they
--
they
take
a
little
part
of
it
which
they
hear.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
would
be
the
--
that
would
be
the
same
--
that
actually
was
what
was
done
in
olmstead.
it's
--
it's
by
induction.
it
is
taking
the
electrical
energy
out
of
the
line
rather
than
through
a
direct
connection
that
is
taken
out
by
--
by
induction.
and
that
is
the
type
of
wire-tapping
which
was
involved,
i
believe,
in
--
in
the
olmstead
cases
found.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
the
--
the
situation
of
someone
listening
in
on
an
--
an
extension
phone
is
so
common
today
that
the
results
of
holding
this
to
be
an
interception
so
that
the
divulgence
would
make
for
their
own
legality,
would
have
far
reaching
effects,
probably,
much
further
than
--
than
congress
could
have
intended
at
the
time
they
passed
the
statute.
it's
usual
--
it's
customary
for
businessmen,
for
government
officials,
not
with
any
ulterior
motive
but
merely
in
order
to
have
two
minds
on
a
--
or
maybe
a
stenographic
transcript
have
a
--
a
record
made
of
what
has
been
said,
to
have
a
secretary
listen
on
an
extension
telephone.
and
it
isn't
considered
or
--
or
frequently
at
any
rate
it
isn't
ever
mentioned.
the
parties
don't
feel
that
there
should
be
any
concern
with
it
and
it's
never
mentioned
that
the
secretary
is
listening.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
mean,
is
that
why
--
is
that
an
interception?
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
never
been
–
i
--
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
law.
my
--
i
--
i
suggest
to
your
honor,
that
on
the
rationale
which
--
which
i
present,
it
is
not
interception.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
it
is
--
it's
been
done
in
rural
areas,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
interception
within
the
meaning
of
section
605,
it
would
make
no
difference.
mr.
john
f.
davis
unless
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
unless
a
theory
is
adopted
that
there
is
a
consent
because
of
the
wide
use
of
--
extension
telephones
that
when
one
makes
a
call
from
station
a
to
station
b,
one
impliedly
consents
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it's
not
an
official
one.
it's
like
relating
back.
i
don't
think
that
i
actually
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
do
consent
to
it.
i
mean
i
just
don't
think
of
it,
that's
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
--
that's
possible
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
my
own
mind,
i
don't
think
about
it.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it's
all
right.
i
just
don't
think
about
it.
but
if
that
were
the
basis
for
saying
that
that
was
not
an
interception,
i
mean
an
interception
but
it
consented
to
interception,
then,
of
course,
there'd
be
no
consent
in
your
case
where
you'd
said
no
and
in
that
case,
it
would
make
a
difference.
but
that
is
not
the
theory
which
i
--
which
i
urged
to
your
honors.
i
do
not
urge
--
although
there
is
in
this
case
a
--
an
issue
of
consent.
i
said
a
minute
ago
that
--
that
we
didn't
rely
on
consent
in
this
particular
case.
i
should
call
to
your
attention
the
--
the
testimony
that
the
petitioner
here
said,
“i
do
not
care
whether
you're
recording
it”
--
well
it's
his
particular
language
was,
"i'm
going
to
kill
you
and
i
don't
care
if
you're
making
a
recording
of
this
conversation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well,
that
isn't
my
intention.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
it
is
not
my
intention
that
it's
for
the
protection
of
the
company.
the
old
malicious
mischief
in
interference
with
telephone
conversation
cases
did
have
that
basis,
but
here,
the
--
the
object
is
to
protect
the
privacy,
if
you
please,
of
the
parties
to
a
telephone
conversation
insofar
as
the
telephone
system,
as
such,
is
involved
in
their
relationships
between
each
other
but
not
to
give
them
any
additional
protection
because
of
the
fact
that
they
used
the
telephone.
let
me
be
clear.
if,
a
talks
to
b
and
someone
overhears
them
lying
under
the
couch
or
something
like
that
surreptitiously,
that
is
not
protected
in
the
ordinary
case.
now,
if
a
talks
to
b
over
a
telephone
and
someone
overhears
in
a
similar
way
the
fact
that
a
telephone
has
been
used,
this
is
my
argument,
does
not
give
any
added
protection,
any
added
confidential
nature
to
that
conversation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
even
though
it
goes
over
a
wire.
there's
no
reason
why
one
should
get
more
protection
because
he
talks
over
the
telephone
than
he
would
if
he
talked
face
to
face.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
a
provision
in
order
of
the
federal
communications
commission
which
we
referred
to
at
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
requiring
what
they
call
a
--
they
call
it
a
beep
--
they
call
a
--
and
anyway,
there's
a
--
there
is
a
beep.
there
is
--
[laughs]
there
is
a
sound
signal
which
is
required
by
the
federal
--
order
of
federal
communications
commission
to
be
made
when
a
recording
device
is
connected
to
one
end
of
a
telephone
system.
and
we
refer
in
our
brief
to
the
commission
report
in
which
they
adopted
this
and
the
federal
communications
commission
in
making
this
requirement,
made
no
suggestion
that
this
was
based
upon
a
question
of
--
of
wire-tapping
or
that
this
was
--
had
anything
to
--
with
section
605.
instead,
the
question
was
the
--
whether
or
not
this
was
a
--
a
reasonable
way
to
use
the
system,
how
to
protect
the
system
so
that
these
devices
could
be
properly
used
so
the
parties
would
know
that
they
were
being
used
and
--
and
that
nature
of
thing.
but
no
--
no
suggestion
that
there's
--
was
any
wire-tapping
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh.
well,
i
--
they
--
they
expressed
no
view
one
way
or
another.
it
might
well
--
i
think
that
they
would
say
that
listening
in
--
if
the
listener
in
--
gave
a
--
a
beep,
it
was
certainly
not
wire-tapping
because
they
authorized
it
with
respect
to
a
machine
and
so
they
would
authorize
it
with
respect
to
individuals
if
their
presence
were
as
disclosed.
whether
you
can
draw
any
conclusion
if
their
presence
is
not
disclosed,
i'm
not
sure.
i
--
i've
cited
that
material
and
--
and
its
interesting
reading
but
i
feel
that
the
communications
commission
just
stayed
away
entirely
from
any
--
from
any
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
wire-tapping
was
involved
when
at
one
end
of
the
--
of
the
line,
some
--
some
monitoring
of
some
kind
was
done.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
a
b-e-e-p.
a
beep
that
makes
a
little
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
goes
--
it
goes,
buzz,
buzz,
buzz
and
the
communications
commission's
artist
require
that
the
so-called
beep,
beeps
or
what
you
get
where
there's
two-fifths
per
second
in
duration
and
be
repeated
eight
times
a
minute
or
something
like
this
so
that
when
there
is
a
listening
device
on
the
phone
and
you
called
somebody
and
sometimes
one
hears
this
on
the
radio
where
there's
a
recorded
--
a
--
something
recorded
over
telephone
lines,
you'll
hear
periodically.
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
--
with
the
conversations
that
you
hear
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you'll
hear
–
well
--
it's
quite
distinctive.
it
sounds
like
a
little
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughter]
something
like
--
it
just
someone
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
in
the
sense
that
judge
hand
used
it
that
it
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
he
was
dealing
in
that
case
with
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
there
is
dormant
in
this
case
and
i
think
i
will
leave
it
to
a
discussion
in
the
next
case
since
there
was
a
limited
grant
of
certiorari
in
here
but
there
is
dormant
in
this
case
the
problem
of
the
interception
if
there
was
--
were
an
interception
being
performed
by
--
by
state
officers
without
any
participation
by
federal
officers.
and
in
the
event
that
it
should
be
held
that
an
interception
was
involved,
then
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
still
not
be
reversed
if
this
question
--
on
this
question
of
the
state
officers
against
federal
officers,
the
court
accepts
our
view
that
the
evidence
may
be
received
in
evidence
when
only
interception
by
state
officers
is
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
can
--
you
can
take
it
up
in
spite
of
the
grant.
it's
interesting
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
interestingly
enough
in
the
olmstead
case
itself,
there
was
a
limited
grant
of
certiorari.
in
that
case,
limited
to
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
court
decided
in
that
case
not
only
the
fourth
amendment
question
but
also
the
questions
raised
by
the
dissenters
as
to
whether
it
was
a
proper
thing
to
do
and
this
court
is
certainly
free
to
--
to
decide
in
this
case
what
it
--
anything
that
if
feels
is
--
is
necessary
to
a
--
to
a
conclusion
to
a
determination
of
the
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
i
think
that
it
sound,
your
honor.
maybe
the
reason
that
we
don't
put
any
more
emphasis
on
it
is
because
it's
not
an
--
not
a
tremendously
important
question
from
the
point
of
view
of
--
of
maybe
you'll
feel
that
you
have
to
decide
it
on
that
your
honor.
what
are
these
things
we
feel
we
must
bring
before
you
and
we
think
it's
--
we
think
our
position
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
a
matter
of
choice,
your
honor.
i
mean
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
the
lower
court
didn't
deal
with
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
that
one
--
that
this
court
will
read
these
words
which
i
have
quoted
at
page
5
there's
--
there's
nothing
more
to
it
and
if
--
if
it
seems
to
this
court
that
this
settles
the
question
that
this
is
consent,
it's
clear,
and
if
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
don't
really
know
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
don't
recollect
how
well
it
was
--
how
much
it
was
pressed
or
whether
it
was
pressed
at
all.
it's
in
the
record
and
it
was
before
the
court
but
whether
anyone
pressed
it,
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
wouldn't
–
it
--
it
wouldn't
--
well,
it
wouldn't
really
do
much
good
to
just
decide
--
it's
cited
that
in
this
sort
of
a
situation
one
consents
and
--
but
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
decide
really
anything
except
this
particular
case.
