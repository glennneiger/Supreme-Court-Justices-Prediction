mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
may
ask
--
may
i
ask
this
question?
on
the
question
of
seniority,
suppose
that
some
of
the
members
of
6051
claims
seniority
rights
that
conflicted
with
--
with
the
position
of
--
of
people
in
--
in
28
and
that
was
taken
up
with
the
company.
who
would
represent
the
international
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
just
wondered
if
it
went
to
that
extent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
might
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may.
mr.
hickey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
fact
in
regard
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hickey
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this
question.
as
i
understood
you
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
said
that
without
binding
your
clients
but
as
a
member
of
the
bar
you
would
be
forced
to
say
that
if
--
if
they
had
alleged
that
they
had
made
application
to
join
the
white
union
and
had
been
denied
that
it
would
have
put
them
in
court,
that
they
--
they
could
have
stated
the
cause
of
action.
did
i
--
did
i
misunderstand
you
in
that
or
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
--
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
--
is
this.
the
--
the
court
decided
or
dismissed
this
on
one
--
on
one
theory
that
--
that
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
now,
if
--
if
those
things
had
been
alleged
in
the
complaint,
what
is
there
in
the
decision
of
the
court
to
indicate
that
it
--
it
might
still
have
said
that
the
matter
was
entirely
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board?
that's
the
thing
that
bothers
--
bothers
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hickey,
may
i
--
may
i
just
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
one
more
question
and
i
apologize
for
doing
it.
but
in
the
event
they
did
take
it
before
that
adjustment
board
themselves,
who
would
their
complaint
be
against,
the
railroad?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
was
--
what
i
was
interested
in
was
one
point
beyond
that.
you
said
that
essentially,
the
--
the
complaint
would
be
against
the
railroad.
now,
could
they
also
have
litigated
before
the
adjustment
board,
any
complaint
that
they
had
against
the
189
or
28
rather
for
a
refusal
to
--
to
properly
process
their
case
and
--
and
present
it
to
the
--
to
the
board
as
distinguished
from
the
interest
of
28.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
waddy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
saying,
you're
compelled
to
join
this
6051
or
whatever
it
was.
do
you
mean
anything
different
in
that
--
then
that
you
refuse
admission
to
28?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
waddy.
