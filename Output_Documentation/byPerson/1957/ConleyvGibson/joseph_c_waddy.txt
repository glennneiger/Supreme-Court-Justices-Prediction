mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
affirming
a
judgment
of
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas,
dismissing
petitioners'
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
the
case
is
one
of
the
series
that
have
been
before
this
court
since
1940,
early
1940s.
in
an
attempt
on
the
--
on
the
part
of
negro
railroad
workers
to
secure
for
themselves
the
benefits
of
collective
bargaining
and
the
fair
representation
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
railway
labor
act.
the
courts
below
in
dismissing
petitioners'
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
have
held
in
effect
that
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
under
the
railway
labor
act
of
a
class
or
craft
of
employees
is
under
no
judicially
enforceable
duty
to
refrain
from
using
its
statutory
position
and
power
to
discriminate
on
the
account
of
race
except
in
the
making
of
a
contract.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
well,
that
is
this
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
my
next
statement
to
the
court.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
simply
wanted
the
court
to
know
that
within
the
--
this
framework
of
reference
that
i
have
mentioned.
the
effect
of
the
court
below
in
saying
that
there
was
no
judicially
enforceable
duty.
and
also,
that
the
court
has
held
in
effect
that
the
statutory
representative
are
in
a
dispute
with
the
member
of
a
craft
or
has
no
judicially
enforceable
duty
and
that
--
that
dispute
must
be
carried
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
now,
the
facts
are
to
which
this
case
arises
and
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
are
as
follows.
petitioners
are
employees
of
the
texas
and
new
orleans
railroad
working
in
the
freight
house
at
houston,
texas.
they
are
negroes.
they
are
members
of
a
craft
or
class
of
station
employees,
clerks,
freight
handlers,
et
cetera.
and
that
craft
or
class
is
represented
by
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks
which
is
the
respondent
here.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
brotherhood
has
used
its
statutory
position
and
power
under
the
act
to
discriminate
against
them
on
a
count
of
their
race.
and
they
claim
that
the
brotherhood
used
the
union
shop
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act
and
made
an
agreement
with
the
carrier
requiring
that
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment,
all
members
of
the
craft
including
these
petitioners
must
join
the
union.
they
also
charge
that
at
houston,
texas,
respondent
maintains
two
locals.
one
of
those
locals
is
composed
exclusively
of
negroes.
that
is
local
6051.
the
other
is
composed
of
exclusively
of
white
employees,
all
being
members
of
the
same
craft
or
class.
they
have
alleged
that
the
maintenance
of
these
segregated
local
by
the
brotherhood,
as
a
part
of
a
scheme,
to
deprive
the
negroes
of
the
benefits
of
collective
bargaining
and
not
permitting
them
to
participate
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
so
far
as
my
information
is,
they
came
into
existence
years
ago.
the
two
locals,
these
--
i
don't
know
whether
or
by
request
from
the
negroes
or
merely
because
as
a
matter
of
the
traditional
setup
in
the
south.
i
suspect
it
was
a
traditional
setup
in
the
south
wherein
that
negroes
have
traditionally
been
in
segregated
locals
and
whites
in
another.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct
so
far
as
i
understand.
it
was
an
old
condition.
however,
the
requirement
for
membership
only
comes
into
being
since
1951
with
the
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act
which
requires
a
membership
as
a
condition
to
continue
employment.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
they
claim
that
local
28
which
is
the
white
local,
carries
on
all
of
the
collective
bargaining
for
the
craft,
and
that
local
6051
does
not
offer
the
same
type
of
representation
and
benefits
of
collective
bargain
that
those
who
are
members
of
local
28
can
get.
in
other
words
that
by
local
28
carrying
on
the
collective
bargaining
and
the
negro
is
being
confined
for
local
6051
they're
cut
off
from
all
participation
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
no,
the
agreement
has
been
in
effect
since
1939.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
it
is
not
subject
just
--
it's
renewable
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
30
days
notice.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
my
information
is
that
the
union,
the
international,
formulates
the
demands
and
makes
the
demand
from
the
carrier
and
the
carrier
negotiates
with
the
international
or
because
most
of
these
wage
movements
since
1951
had
been
at
the
national
level.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
well,
any
matter
that
might
come
up
because
the
brotherhood
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
all
right.
this
--
this
type
of
thing
suppose
that
we
had
a
question
of
starting
time.
the
local
28
would
--
would
--
and
a
problem
arose
or
they
wanted
to
change
the
starting
time,
local
28
would
do
it
or
it
was
a
question
of
lunch
hour
or
anything
of
that
kind,
local
28
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
seniority
questions,
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
6051
has
no
--
no
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
would
have
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
they'd
have
to
go
through
local
28.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
to
the
general
chairman
of
local
28.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
would
you
do
this
for
us?
now,
you
--
and
the
decisions
in
the
craft
are
made
in
view
to
the
local
28.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
it's
my
--
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
elected
or
whether
or
not
that
they
were
found
on
the
property
and
merely
have
continued
as
collective
bargain
representative
or
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative
without
a
formal
election,
i
don't
know
if
mr.
hickey
perhaps
could
inform
the
court
on
that
but
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
formal
election
or
not.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
well,
the
general
chairman
is
alleged
to
be
their
--
the
representative
of
both
28
and
6051.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
physically,
what
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
but
you
may
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
they
are.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
except
as
to
the
general
chairman.
the
general
chairman
operate
--
acts
for
the
two
locals.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
by
election.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
by
election
of
28.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
they
can't
outvote
him.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
local
--
local
28
would
have
to
do
with
the
general
chairman.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
they
have
to
take
it
up.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
it
went.
it
goes
to
that
extent.
it's
my
understanding
that
6051
has
no
contact
with
management
except
through
the
officers
of
local
28.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
think
they
are
covered
in
the
brief
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
not
all
of
them.
not
all
of
them
are
covered
in
the
complaint.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
because
i
think
some
of
these
questions
were
to
the
effect
of
the
exclusion
from
local
28
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
and
i
don't
think
that
we
have
set
out
all
of
the
effects
that
have
been
inquired
of
here.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
that
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
--
that's
the
question
before
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
that
the
complaint
has
stated
a
judicially
enforceable
duty.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
right.
now,
it
is
also
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
the
union
has
--
have
to
force
them
into
membership
in
the
segregated
locals
has
refused
to
do
anything
for
--
to
protect
the
negroes.
they
claim
for
instance
and
that
45
jobs
were
abolished
in
the
freight
house
at
houston.
and
that
notice
of
the
abolition
of
these
jobs
was
placed
on
the
bulletin
board.that
the
collective
bargain
and
agreement
itself
require
that
prior
notice
to
the
employees
affected
would
be
given,
that
they
have
received
no
notice
and
that
the
45
jobs
where
all
jobs
which
were
occupied
by
negroes.
that
after
petitioners
learned
of
the
abolition
of
their
jobs,
they
requested
the
general
chairman
of
local
28,
the
respondent
here,
to
take
up
their
grievance
and
local
28
and
respondent
refused
to
represent
them,
refused
to
come
to
their
aid
in
any
way.
in
addition
thereto,
they
claim
that
all
of
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
union
was
a
part
of
a
course
of
conduct
maintained
for
the
purpose
of
affording
inferior
representation
to
the
negro
members
of
the
craft
or
class.
they
alleged
that
the
refusal
of
the
brotherhood
to
entertain
their
request
was
solely
on
the
basis
of
race
and
also
that
the
course
of
conduct,
which
they
have
mentioned,
is
on
the
basis
of
race.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
here
that
the
position
of
the
court
below,
holding
that
there
was
no
judicially
enforceable
duty
is
unsound.
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
per
curiam
one
sentence
opinion
cited
two
cases,
number
one
was
the
slocum
case
and
number
two
was
a
(inaudible)
case,
a
fifth
circuit
case
itself.
now,
the
slocum
case
certainly,
in
my
way
of
thinking
has
no
application
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
you
have
two
unions
contending
between
themselves
that
each
of
those
unions
was
entitled
to
how
certain
work
performed
by
members
of
their
organization.
the
railroad
company
brought
a
suit
in
the
state
court
of
new
york
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgement
as
to
which
union
should
perform
this
work.
this
court
held
that
what
was
necessary
in
that
case
was
a
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
that
courts
were
--
have
no
jurisdiction
to
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
that
it
should
go
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
entirely
a
different
situation
than
the
one
that
we
have
before
us
in
this
case,
wherein
that
the
suit
is
against
the
collective
bargaining
representative
for
failure
to
act
and
for
maintenance
of
a
situation
in
which
the
plaintiffs
have
been
discriminated
against
harm.
now,
the
(inaudible)
case
is
a
case
which
came
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
there
you
had
certain
airline
pilots
who
had
been
hired
during
a
strike
period
by
the
national
airlines.
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
these
pilots
who
had
been
hired
to
fly
the
planes
during
the
strike
were
let
out
and
the
old
pilots
came
back.
thereafter,
the
old
pilots
blacklisted
the
--
the
pilots
who
had
worked
during
the
strike
and
would
not
let
their
members
fly
with
them,
set
out
list
to
other
carriers
that
if
they
hire
these
pilots
who
had
worked,
that
--
during
the
strike
that
their
men
will
strike.
two
years
later,
these
pilots
who
had
been
let
out
brought
a
suit
against
the
airline
pilots
association
alleging
that
the
union
was
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
pilots
and
was
using
this
position
to
discriminate.
but
i
think
again
that
here
you
have
a
situation
where
the
persons
who
were
bringing
the
suit
had
no
stand
in
the
suit.
they
were
no
longer
employees
of
the
airline
and
--
and
since
they
were
not
employees
certainly,
they
could
not
at
that
time
come
in
and
say
that
there
was
a
--
a
violation
of
--
of
by
the
union
of
a
statutory
duty
ought
to
them.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
there
was
an
action
for
damages
as
well
as
for
an
injunction.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
but
the
suit
itself
and
i
think
this
is
the
crucial
thing,
the
suit
itself
doesn't
--
did
not
require
any
interpretation
of
an
agreement.
the
--
the
decision,
the
result
can
be
placed
entirely
upon
the
fact
that
the
persons
were
not
member
of
the
craft
or
class
at
all
at
that
time
because
they
were,
they
had
been
fired
two
years
before.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
oh,
no.
it
would
not
take
care
of
the
action
for
damages
under
the
elgin
case,
it
would
not
take
care.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
we
are
asking
the
federal
court
and
there
are
number
of
prayers
i
think,
that
are
unnecessary
but
fundamentally.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
right.
yes.
fundamentally,
we
asked
the
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
holding
that
the
use
of
--
by
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
union
shop
provisions
thereof
to
compel
petitioners
to
join
the
union,
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment
and
its
failure
thereafter
and
its
refusal
thereafter
to
represent
plaintiffs
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
race
or
color
states
of
color
or
claim
which
is
judicially
enforceable
in
the
courts.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
we
think
it's
wrong
but
no
such
prayer
has
been
made.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
we
don't
ask
that
but
we
think
the
effect
of
it
would
--
will
bring
about
that
because
their
representation,
we
think
cannot
exist
in
the
segregation
itself.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
it's
larger.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
possibly
not
under
those
circumstances.
however,
i
feel
this
much
that
the
very
facts
that
you
are
in
and
participating
in
these
matter
that
you
have
a
voice
and
opportunity
to
sway
somebody
else
or
to
be
swayed,
that
they
go
to
the
essence
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
and
of
course
if
--
if
in
a
particular
situation
the
majority
outvotes
you
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
--
well,
that
--
that's
a
part
of
the
democratic
process
but
our
position
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
no.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
we
feel
that
fair
representation
and
participation
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
cannot
exist
in
the
segregated
local.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
well,
we
--
we
have,
yes.
we
go
against
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
well,
there
is
the
prayer
in
the
suit
that
the
--
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
segregation
is
in
itself
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
right.
for
that,
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
in
the
prayer
--
in
prayer
number
--
prayer
number
three,
yes,
page
15
of
the
record.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
the
court
(voice
overlap)
entered
a
final
judgment
and
decree,
(a)
declaring
that
the
segregation
of
negro
employees
of
the
craft,
represented
by
the
brotherhood
into
a
separate
local
is
illegal
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
if
they
actually
mean
railway
labor
act
and
it's
contrary
to
the
union
shop
amendment
of
march
1,
1953
and
to
permanently
and
perpetually
enjoin
the
brotherhood
its
office,
agents
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
yes,
we
do
ask.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
my
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
yes.
i'll
be
happy
to.
we
feel
that
the
fact
that
congress
might
not
have
made
a
specific
prohibition
of
the
segregated
local
was
no
of
apart
to
the
beneficiaries
of
the
statutory
power
or
to
carry
on
segregation.
in
other
words,
there
--
the
fact
that
they
did
not
specifically
prohibited
and
did
not
say
that,
“you
may
not
take
--
your
property
without
due
process
there's
no
authority
to
take
it
without
due
process.”
and
in
addition
to
that,
we
feel
that
congress
could
not
constitutionally
authorize
segregation.
and
furthermore,
regardless
and
whatever
they
meant
in
that,
we
feel
further
that
they
did
not
intend
that
a
situation
such
as
it's
shown
here,
where
the
employees
is
forced
into
the
union
and
then
the
union
refuses
to
do
anything
for
him
after
enforcement
on
the
ground
was
raised.
certainly,
that
situation
was
not
contemplated
by
the
congress
at
the
time
that
it
amended
the
statute
in
1951.
now,
we
feel
that
the
holdings
of
the
court
below
are
first,
is
unsound
because
if
there
is
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
representative
to
represent
fairly
and
to
refrain
from
using
its
statutory
position
except
in
the
case
of
the
making
of
the
contract
then
the
union
would
be
free
to
otherwise
discriminate
at
will.
and
there
would
be
nothing
whatsoever
that
a
person
discriminated
against
could
do
and
they
--
their
rights
would
be
completely
lost
under
the
operations
of
a
federal
statute.
we
feel
that
congress
in
establishing
the
railway
labor
act
and
placing
the
duty
to
represent
intended
that
the
duty
would
be
coextensive
with
the
authority
and
power
that
was
given
the
representative.
and
since
that
is
true,
the
power
and
authority
extends
beyond
the
making
of
a
contract
and
goes
to
the
entire
collective
bargaining
process.
now,
we
feel
further
that
congress
never
intended
that
the
railway
labor
act
should
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
members
of
the
craft
for
membership
in
the
union
or
relocating
them
to
a
separate
local.
there,
this
court
said
--
this
court
said
in
the
j.i.
case
company
case
that
the
very
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
was
to
secure
for
the
members
of
the
craft,
rights
which
they
could
not
get
individually
and
then
this
court
came
along
in
steele
case
--
in
the
steele
case
and
said
that
the
very
purpose
of
--
of
providing
for
a
representative
was
to
secure
those
benefits
of
collective
bargaining
that
this
court
had
mentioned
in
the
j.i.
case
company
case.
we
feel
also
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
contrary
to
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
steele,
tunstall,
graham
and
howard
cases.
and
particularly,
we
feel
that
the
howard
case
which
extended
the
doctrine
of
the
steele
case
which
says
that
the
union
may
not
use
its
position
and
power
to
discriminate,
certainly
goes
beyond
a
question
of
a
making
of
contract
because
its
position
and
power
are
--
is
--
are
greater
than
the
mere
making
of
a
contract.
now,
the
court
below
has
further
in
effect
held
that
the
collective
bargaining
representative
might
have
a
dispute
with
a
member
of
the
craft
or
class
and
that
dispute
must
be
carried
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
now,
we
feel
that
that
is
entirely
unsound
and
that
this
court
said
so
in
steele
that
this
court
said
--
that
section
3
first
(i)
who
had
sets
up
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
makes
no
mention
of
the
dispute
between
the
collective
bargaining
representative
and
the
individual
member
of
the
craft.
therefore,
that
you
do
not
have
a
situation
where
as
any
interpretation
of
the
agreement,
this
is
a
dispute
which
was
called
out
from
those
which
were
placed
under
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
at
the
time
the
statute
was
amended.
we
feel
further
that
there
is
no
contract
in
this
case
to
be
interpreted.
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
not
the
meaning
of
the
contract,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
the
conduct
of
the
representative
in
connection
with
the
representation
or
lack
of
representation
which
this
record
reveals.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
not
that
i
know
of
(inaudible)
the
only
place
where
the
collective
agreement
comes
to
this
picture
is
the
fact
that
the
brotherhood
refused
to
entertain
the
complaint
of
the
negroes
that
--
that
had
been
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
we
are
asking
--
saying
that
the
agreement
asking
for
a
relief
for
the
violation
of
the
agreement.
we
are
asking
relief
here
against
the
brotherhood
for
refusal
to
entertain
the
agreement
solely,
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
think
that
we
could
have
gone
to
the
adjustment
board
in
a
complaint
against
the
carrier
on
the
contract.
but
i
think
that's
entirely
different
situation,
i
think
that's
a
concurrent
remedy
which
would
have
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
--
that
is
the
part
of
my
position.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
the
other
position
is
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
it
could
not
have.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
it
could
not
have.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
because
that
is
a
question
between
the
union
and
the
individual.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
against
the
carrier
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
think
we
would
still
be
in
court.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
think,
it
would
still
be
in
court
with
an
allegation
at
that
time
that
could
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
don't
think
we
could
because
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
--
it
does
not
require.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
--
i
think,
that
it
would
not
be
a
grievance
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
would
not
be
grievance
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
way
a
contract
to
be
interpreted.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
it
is
not
because
i
feel
that
the
adjustment
board
is
a
limited
board.
its
jurisdiction
is
limited
only
to
the
interpretation
or
application
of
a
grievance
and
that
when
it
comes
down
to
the
question
as
to
the
whether
or
not
the
collective
bargaining
representative
has
used
its
statutory
power
to
discriminate
that
that
matter
and
i
think
this
court
so
held
in
steele
and
howard.
that
those
matters
are
matters
for
the
courts
and
that
if
they
were
not
matters
for
the
court
and
they
were
relocated
to
the
adjustment
board,
the
right
to
fair
representation
that
the
negroes
were
entitled
to
would
be
sacrificed
and
obliterated
because
the
fact
that
the
union
sit
on
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
railroad
companies
sit
on
the
adjustment
board
so
that
once
you
have
--
you
have
the
same
people
that
your
complaining
against
that
it
was
in
judgement
on
your
complaint.
and
certainly,
that
would
not
be
inadequate
remedy
and
i
think
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that's
my
position.
now,
we
finally
would
say
to
the
court
that
with
respect
to
the
broad
issue
which
is
here
posed.
we
feel
that
this
court
should
hold
that
federal
courts
may
entertain
a
complaint
of
negro
members
of
a
craft
or
railroad
workers
against
their
collective
bargaining
representative
which
alleges
that
the
representative
in
carrying
on
a
plan
course
of
conduct,
designed
to
discriminate
has
used
its
statutory
power
and
position
to
exclude
complainants
solely
because
of
their
race
from
participating
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
we
feel
that
this
court
should
also
hold,
as
it
did
in
steele
that
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
union
has
discriminated
against
the
individual
is
not
a
matter
for
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
and
finally,
we
feel
that
this
court
i
hope
that
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
complaint
of
negro
members
of
a
craft
and
railroad
workers
which
alleges
that
their
exclusive
bargaining
representative
under
the
railway
labor
act
has
used
its
statutory
position
and
power
to
compel
negro
members
of
the
craft
or
class
to
join
a
racial
and
segregated
local
solely
because
they
are
negroes
and
for
the
purpose
of
affording
them
representation
inferior
to
and
different
from
that
afforded
to
the
white
members
of
the
craft.
we
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
until
--
after
the
respondent.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
point
out
one
thing.
throughout
mr.
hickey
has
taken
the
position
that
only
one
thing
is
charged
here
and
that
is
the
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
the
railroad
company.
however,
on
page
11,
paragraph
7
of
this
complaint,
there
is
a
very
definite
charge
that
this
brotherhood
has
repeatedly
and
without
reason
declined
to
hear
the
complaint
of
these
petitioners.
now,
what
he
would
say
that
he
would
go
further
and
say
but
they
do
say
that
the
brotherhood
told
them
that
the
due
to
the
leasing
of
this
property
and
nothing
could
be
done
about
it.
there
is
nothing
that
i
find
in
this
record
to
go
to
the
point
where
mr.
hickey
went
to
say
that
the
brotherhood
took
up
this
matter.
the
allegation
is
that
the
brotherhood
refused
to
hear
them.
it
never
got
to
the
point
wherein
that
--
it
could
consider
the
merits
of
this
case.
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
is
that,
they
refused
to
hear
on
the
basis
of
race
so
that
--
so
that
as
to
whether
their
complaint
had
merit
in
that
or
not,
they've
never
reached
that
point.
now,
i
submit
that
mr.
hickey's
position,
is
this
that
i
go
to
the
court
and
say
to
the
court
that,
“mr.
gardner
here
assaulted
me,”
the
court
said,
“no,
he
didn't,”
without
hearing
any
facts
or
anything
and
your
case
is
gone.
i
--
i
that's
--
that's
the
position
that
mr.
hickey
would
have
to
state
but
what
is
done
here
is
that
the
union
simply
has
not
in
any
way
or
heard
these
plaintiffs
and
that
is
the
real
basis
of
this
complaint,
the
compelling
of
the
members
of
the
craft,
the
negro
members
of
the
craft
to
join
the
union
and
then
refusing
to
even
consider
their
claims
on
a
basis
of
race
as
for
whether
they
have
or
have
no
merit.
now,
we
submit
that
that's
where
they
would
in
howard.
it's
the
use
of
statutory
position
and
power
to
discriminate.
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
we
feel
that
there
is
definitely
a
cause
of
action
stated
here
which
this
court
should
reverse
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
the
purpose
of
reinstating
the
complaint
and
to
file
answers
because
most
of
what
mr.
hickey
have
said
is
really
proof
to
be
used
in
advertent,
plaintiffs
were
unable
to
prove
their
allegations.
that's
one
thing
but
as
to
whether
or
not
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
their
claim
is
another.
we
submit
that
there
should
be
a
reversal.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
my
understanding
of
the
allegation
compelled
is
that
they
cannot
join
local
28.
now,
i
don't
--
don't
understand
to
say,
that
they
have
asked.
what
the
proof
to
be,
i
don't
know
that.
but
i
think
that
that
allegation
is
sufficiently
broad
so
that
the
proof
could
show
that
they
had
--
that
they
applied
and
were
not
admitted
or
that
they
were
told
by
the
officer
of
the
brotherhood
that
you
can't
come
in
number
28,
you've
got
to
become
(inaudible).
i
think
that
proves
one
thing
but
the
allegation
is
broad
enough
sustain
the
proof
in
either
direction
that
makes
up.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
would
regard
that
as
stating
a
cause
of
action
but
i
think
we
have
more
here
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
that
is
a
compelling
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
would
say
to
that
in
itself
would
state
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
but
--
but
it
would
be
pursuant
under
the
union
shop
agreement
pursuant
to
the
statutory
power
--
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
--
to
compel
them
to
join
the
union
otherwise
it
couldn't
compel.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
would
certainly
say.
mr.
joseph
c.
waddy
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
if
the
railway
labor
act
permits
it
then
the
railway
labor
act
will
be
unconstitutional.
