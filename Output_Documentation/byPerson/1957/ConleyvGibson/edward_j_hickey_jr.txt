mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
i
represent
the
respondents
on
this
appeal
to
where
the
defendants
in
the
action
below.
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks
and
the
general
chairman
of
the
brotherhood
on
the
texas
and
new
orleans
railroad
and
the
division
chairman,
let
me
say
this
at
the
outset
that
my
reaction
to
the
argument
just
made
by
mr.
waddy
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
is
identical
to
the
reaction
i
had
when
i
read
his
brief.
his
basic
proposition
of
law
that
the
fiduciary
duty
imposed
by
the
railway
labor
act
on
the
bargaining
representative
is
not
limited
to
the
making
of
an
agreement
but
extends
to
the
total
power
or
authority
of
the
bargaining
representative
under
the
statute
may
well
be
correct.
i
am
not
prepared
in
this
case
to
say
that
it
is
not.
i
do
want
to
say,
however,
that
i
don't
think
that
it
is
involved
in
this
case
because
the
facts
of
this
case
as
we
view
them
do
not
support
either
a
claim
of
the
bargaining
representative
has
abused
its
statutory
authority
or
that
the
bargaining
representative
has
breached
its
fiduciary
duty.
it
will
be
my
purpose
to
show
that
when
the
complaint
is
carefully
analyze
with
respect
to
its
concrete
factual
allegations
concerning
the
action
and
the
conduct
of
respondents
or
the
brotherhood,
i
refer
to
the
respondents
collectively
as
a
brotherhood,
it
fails
to
establish
any
abuse
of
statutory
power
by
the
brotherhood
or
any
breach
of
its
fiduciary
duty.
in
other
words,
your
honors,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
issues
as
they
have
been
presented
in
petitioners
brief
and
as
they
have
been
argued
here
today
find
support
in
the
concrete
facts
of
this
complaint.
and
we
believe
that
petitioners
are
presenting
to
the
court
academic
or
abstract
issues
of
racial
discrimination
for
determination.
to
be
specific,
may
i
refer
to
the
statement
of
the
questions
presented
for
determination.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
correct
sir
and
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
facts
of
the
complaint
as
mr.
frankfurter
as
--
as
did
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
indicated
by
his
questions
are
most
important
in
this
case
and
i
intend
to
go
into
them
carefully
in
support
of
the
position
i
have
just
taken.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
the
--
we
took
the
position
in
the
court
below
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted,
that
it
--
that
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
complaint
that
it
failed
to
name
an
indispensable
party
defendant,
the
railroad.
and
it
is
our
position
that
on
the
ground
on
which
petitioner
actually
teaches
his
case
in
terms
of
isolating
the
railroad,
that
it
comes
down
to
that
if
we
meet
him
squarely
on
that
ground
that
it
fails
to
--
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
segregated
local
large
is,
fails
to
present
a
justiciable
issue
and
fails
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
but
if
we
look
at
the
case
in
terms
of
its
substance
as
distinguished
from
the
form
in
which
it
is
cast,
we
believe
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
viewing
it
as
essentially
and
in
substance
a
complaint
against
the
railroad.
although
the
railroad
was
not
named
for
discrimination
and
violation
of
the
agreement
by
the
railroad
which
claim
should
be
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
i
am.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
think,
i
--
i
have
to
say
it
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
think
i
can
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
think,
i
can
say
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
believe
that
we
are
permitted
to
argue
before
this
court
in
any
ground
which
we
urge
below
which
will
support
the
judgment
of
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
that
is
my
--
that
has
been
my
view.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
we
feel
that
as
--
as
the
argument
develops,
we
actually
can
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
on
the
question
of
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
and
the
presence
of
jurisdiction
in
the
adjustment
board.
but
it
is
my
position
that
even
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
doing
that
with
respect
to
both
of
the
claims
present
in
this
case
that
if
their
judgments
of
dismissal
are
correct
that
we
are
properly
urging
a
ground
which
we
raised
below
in
which
the
court
held,
it
was
unnecessary
to
reach.
the
court
said
in
our
view
since
we
hold
that
these
claims
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board,
it
is
not
necessary
to
pass
on
the
other
grounds
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
the
case
has
been
so
cast
in
terms
of
isolation
of
what
we
view
to
be
the
real
substance
of
this
complaint
of
the
railroad,
that
we
are
trying
to
meet
the
case
on
the
same
ground
that
it's
been
briefed
and
it's
been
argued
by
petitioners.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
the
--
the
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
say
this,
i
think
that
the
two
arguments
is
--
as
we
make
an
actually
call
less.
i
am
not
talking
of
--
of
technical
defects
of
omission.
i'm
talking
of
defects
and
omissions
of
real
substance
as
i
will
now
attempt
to
make
clear
as
i
was
preparing
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
questions
presented
in
support
of
my
position
actually
abstract
issues
are
being
presented
here.
first
of
all,
on
page
3
of
petitioners'
brief,
they
state
that
the
basic
proposition
of
the
law
here
is
whether
a
bargaining
representative
violates
its
fiduciary
duty
to
all
members
of
the
craft
under
the
railway
labor
act
when
it
bars
them,
meaning
petitioners,
for
membership
and
its
local
lodge
which
carries
on
the
collective
bargaining
process.
now
right
there,
there
is
not
a
single
allegation
nor
could
there
be,
and
that's
why
i
say
this
is
not
technical
to
support
the
statement
that
the
union
bars
them
from
membership
in
its
local
lodge.
it
then
goes
on
and
states
that
the
union
uses
its
statutory
position
to
compel
them
to
maintain
membership
in
an
inferior
racially
segregated
local.
there
are
no
allegations
which
will
support
the
statement
that
the
union
uses
its
statutory
position
to
do
these
things.
it
refuses
to
exert
any
effort
toward
the
maintenance
of
the
collective
agreement
insofar
as
it
pertains
to
negro
members
of
the
craft.
that
is
very
important.
and
it
has
been
the
subject
of
much
questioning
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
chief
justice.
in
our
view,
there
is
not
a
single
allegation
of
concrete
fact
in
this
complaint
which
will
support
that
statement
that
the
union
is
carrying
on
a
course
of
conduct
of
refusing
to
exert
any
effort
towards
the
maintenance
of
the
collective
agreement.
this
complaint
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
it
--
it
states
that
the
union
refuses
to
take
any
steps
to
investigate
and
redress
their
wrongs
so
this
were
continuing
constant
things,
we
say
there
are
no
allegations
to
support
that.
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice,
if
there
were
in
existence
any
factual
situation
to
--
to
warrant
such
as
--
such
an
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
there's
no
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
my
point,
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
no,
you're
not
wrong
about
that.
but
i
--
i'm
trying
to
say
that
there
--
there
really
isn't
any
charge
in
this
complaint
that
the
brotherhood
has
persistently
and
consistently
refused
to
represent
the
negro
petitioners
in
collective
bargaining.
this
complaint
doesn't
even
say
that
at
least
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
am
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
claim
that
it
does
say
that.
now,
what
does
the
case
really
involve,
what
are
the
concrete
facts?
they
actually
blow
down
in
our
view
to
two
separate
and
unrelated
claims.
the
first
is
that
the
brotherhood
is
violating
the
railway
labor
act
by
its
maintenance
of
separate
locals
for
white
and
negro
at
houston
and
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i'm
going
to
add
one
other
allegation
that
is
made,
mr.
justice
burton
and
compelling
the
negro
members
to
join
local
6051.
now
right
there,
there
is
not
a
single
allegation
that
the
brotherhood
has
ever
refused
to
admit
any
of
petitioners
to
local
28.
there
is
no
allegation
in
fact
that
any
of
petitioners
ever
sought
admission
to
local
28
and
i
hope
that
no
member
of
this
court
will
feel
that
i
am
quibbling
when
i
say
that
that
is
a
very
important
matter
of
substance
and
not
a
technicality.
the
reason
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
the
fact
is
that
no
one
has
ever
applied,
your
honor.
no
one
has
ever
been
turned
down.
and
i
--
i
would
prefer
rather
than
to
go
out
of
the
--
outside
the
record
of
this
case
except
of
course,
i
--
i
will
always
answer
questions.
i
would
like
to
illustrate
what
i
mean
by
the
distinction
between
the
allegations
here
of
compelling
them
to
join
local
6051
and
the
lack
of
any
allegations
if
they've
ever
tried
to
join
local
28
or
they've
ever
been
denied
admission
to
local
28.
a
case
referred
to
in
our
brief,
taylor
against
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks
decision
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
concerning
such
a
situation
as
we
have
here.
that
case
is
fully
litigated
now,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
not
appealed
and
the
situation
there
was
that
a
violation
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
the
point
because
of
the
existence
of
a
segregated
lodge
in
baltimore
similar
to
the
one
maintained
here
and
there
as
here.
there
had
been
no
efforts
made
to
join
the
white
local
during
the
course
of
a
litigation
and
while
depositions
were
being
taken.
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
railway
and
steamship
clerks,
mr.
george
harrison
took
the
position
that
if
any
such
applications
were
made,
they
would
be
honored.
and
to
my
knowledge
that
has
been
his
consistent
position
in
all
segments
of
the
country.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
file
a
motion,
your
honor
on
the
ground
that
with
respect
to
this
particular
claim
concerning
the
segregated
locals
that
it
fails
to
present
a
justiciable
issue.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
it
couldn't
be
amended.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
if
they
said
what
i've
said,
they
would
necessarily
read
themselves
out
of
court
because
they
would
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
well,
they
haven't
applied
for
membership.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
if
--
if
you
have
the
situation
where
there
have
actually
been
an
application
to
enter
the
white
local
and
they
have
been
turned
down
and
that
was
alleged
in
the
complaint,
you
would
have
an
entirely
different
issue
before
this
court,
in
my
view,
and
one
over
which
they
might
very
well
have
jurisdiction.
i
will
--
i
would
prefer
not
to
answer
that
--
the
--
the
answer
to
that
issue
on
behalf
of
my
client
but
as
a
member
of
this
bar,
i'll
answer
it
that
i
think
that
it
would
probably
violate
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
trying
to
illustrate
that
very
thing
by
stating
that
there
is
in
my
view
a
very
basic
distinction
between
what
is
alleged
here
and
the
failure
to
allege
that
they
have
ever
tried
or
that
they
have
ever
been
refused
admission
to
the
white
local.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
but
the
same
allegation,
your
honor,
the
same
allegation
precisely,
and
the
same
situation
precisely
existed
in
the
baltimore
situation
and
when
they
did
make
application
for
admission
to
the
white
local,
they
were
admitted.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
it
is
for
me
unless
you
try
to
join,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
this
pleading
could
possibly
be
amended
by
petitioners
to
state
a
justiciable
issue
because
they
have
in
fact
never
sought
a
commission
and
they
have
never
been
denied
and
i
doubt
that
they
ever
will
be
denied.
but
over
and
above
that
point
with
respect
to
this
particular
issue,
we
raised
the
further
point
that
it
also
states
--
fails
to
state
a
justiciable
issue
because
of
the
action
of
congress
in
passing
a
union
shop
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
already
indicated
at
the
time
that
the
amendment
was
under
consideration
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house,
there
were
very
active
efforts
made
to
have
congress
declare
that
anyone
who
maintained
a
segregated
local
would
be
barred
from
the
benefits
of
the
railway
labor
act.
the
congress
expressly
--
excuse
me
sir,
expressly
refused
to
so
declare.
they
also
went
so
far
as
to
expressly
refuse
to
declare
that
the
denial
of
admission
to
membership
would
be
a
violation
of
the
union
shop
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
we
have
those
statements
of
the
house
and
senate
committee
set
forth
in
our
brief.
i
won't
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
detail
them
here
but
they
are
quite
concrete
and
they
do
amount
to
just
that.
now,
congress
did,
however,
make
its
protection
to
the
members
of
the
craft,
extend
to
protection
of
the
workers
job
in
a
very
carefully
condition.
the
permission
it
extended
for
railroads
and
railroad
organizations
to
make
union
shop
agreements,
in
such
a
way
that
if
a
man's
condition
of
employment
were
not
extended
on
a
uniform
basis
available
to
all
other
members,
then
he
could
get
relief
under
the
railway
labor
act
union
shop
provisions.
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
point
that
we
wish
to
make
here
in
terms
of
our
further
argument,
this
fails
to
state
a
justiciable
issue,
that
in
the
absence
of
any
deprivation
of
employment
or
in
the
absence
of
any
allegation
that
employment
is
threatened
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
petitioners,
the
maintenance
of
separate
segregated
locals
even
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
the
negro
members
are
barred,
fails
to
state
a
justiciable
issue.
now,
it
is
our
position
with
respect
to
the
first
claim
of
the
complaint,
the
allegations
of
which,
boil
down
actually,
all
appear
in
paragraph
7
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
on
pages
9
and
10
of
the
record.
now,
the
other
claim
in
the
case
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
may
have
misspoke
there,
your
honor.
they
would
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
to
the
extent
that
i
was
making
that
other
point
that
actually,
they
hadn't
shown
any
segregation
as
such.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
but
they
would've
stated
a
cause
of
action
with
respect
to
segregation.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
but
they
still
even
so
were
not
stated
justiciable
issue
as
i
understand
and
read
the
legislative
history
accompanying
the
union
shop
provisions
to
the
railway
labor
act
for
the
reason
that
there
has
been
no
deprivation
of
employment.
no
allegation
that
anyone
is
threatened
with
deprivation
of
employment
or
that
membership
in
the
segregated
local
is
made
a
condition
of
his
employment.
the
--
the
complaint
is
not
inadvertent
on
these
matters.
the
more
you
study
there's
a
very
careful
juxta-position
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
as
though
there
were
an
actual
violation
of
those
statutes
but
not
once
in
any
of
the
allegations,
is
there
any
statement
made
nor
is
--
in
fairness
to
mr.
waddy,
has
he
made
any
contention
that
anyone
has
been
forced
to
join
as
a
condition
of
their
continued
employment,
forced
to
maintain
membership
in
the
segregated
local
as
a
condition
of
their
continued
employment.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
--
that's
a
very
good
question,
your
honor.
actually,
this
particular
issue
that
i
am
discussing
now
was
not
pressed
in
the
courts
below
when
which
it
has
been
pressed
here.
to
some
extent,
i
think
that
maybe
responsible
for
their
judgment
and
their
concern
primarily
with
the
second
claim
made
with
respect
to
deprivation
or
abolishment
of
jobs.
but
i
do
believe,
to
answer
your
question
directly,
that
the
judgement
of
the
court
on
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
can
be
supported
on
this
ground
with
respect
to
this
issue
concerning
segregation.
the
provision
of
the
statute
is
clear,
we
think,
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
--
of
some
allegation
concerning
deprivation
of
employment
or
making
it
a
condition
of
employment.
the
provision
of
the
agreement
is
completely
consistent
and
that
--
that
is
conceded
by
petitioners
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute
so
that
you
have
no
problem
of
an
invalid
violation
--
any
violation
of
the
statute
itself.
so,
the
matter
would
come
right
now
to
a
question
of
whether
the
provision
of
the
agreement,
the
union
shop
agreement
which
is
made
in
1953
was
or
was
not
violated
by
the
maintenance
of
the
segregated
local,
absent
some
allegation
concerning
employment
of
any
of
the
petitioners
and
that
too
would
be
a
matter
normally
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad
adjustment
board
because
it
--
it
amounts
to
a
claim
that
this
particular
provision
of
the
bargaining
agreement
made
in
1953
is
not
being
lived
up
to
by
the
brotherhood.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that
might
well
be.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
say
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
may
i
say
this.
the
discussion
of
--
between
you
and
mr.
waddy
with
respect
to
bargaining
and
local
6051
is
not
my
understanding
at
all,
what
goes
on.
i
don't
think
that
there
are
any
allegations
that
in
this
complaint
--
i
don't
think
that
this
complaint
is
even
aimed
or
proposes
to
deal
with
a
situation
of
where
the
union
is
failing
to
handle
grievances
on
behalf
generally.
grievances
regarding
lunch
hours
and
seniority
and
those
things
on
behalf
of
local
6051.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
local
6051
as
is
generally
true
in
--
in
this
union
all
over
the
united
states
has
its
own
grievances
as
they
call
it,
has
its
own
grievance
committee
and
it
can
take
a
matter
and
it
does
every
day
of
its
life,
take
matters
up
to
a
certain
level.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
have
never
--
and
i
read
this
complaint
many
times
and
i've
read
it
carefully.
i
don't
get
anything
more
out
of
this
complaint
than
that
--
this
segregated
local
is
maintained
and
that
the
petitioners
are
compelled
to
join
and
secondly,
that
the
railroad
abolish
certain
jobs
because
of
a
contract
by
which
at
least
certain
property,
formally
operated
by
it
to
the
southern
pacific
transport
company.
and
when
it
turned
--
that
property
over
under
lease
and
the
docks
and
the
freight
house
to
the
southern
pacific
transport
company,
it
made
certain
reductions
enforced.
and
that
because
the
railroad
did
that
and
because
in
doing
it,
the
brotherhood
did
not
prevent
that
action
but
as
the
complaint
says,
“suffered
it
to
transpire
and
did
not
come
to
the
aid
of
plaintiffs,
that
the
brotherhood
violated
its
fiduciary
duty.”
now
that
to
me
is
the
substance.
those
are
the
concrete
facts
of
this
complaint.
anything
else,
i
can
only
get
from
the
argument
in
mr.
waddy's
brief
or
some
sweeping
statements
that
are
made
in
terms
of
the
prayers
for
relief.
but
i
actually
don't
believe
this
complaint
deals
with
anything
that
those
two
specific
situations,
that's
been
our
position
throughout
and
that
is
our
position
now.
now,
with
respect
to
that
second
situation,
and
let
me
deal
with
that
for
a
moment.
what
happened
was
simply
this.
the
--
and
i'm
going
to
keep
myself
within
the
confines
of
the
allegations
of
fact
in
this
complaint.
the
railroad
made
a
lease
with
the
southern
pacific
transport
company,
as
a
result
of
which,
it
lost
jurisdiction
over
the
maintenance
of
certain
of
the
docks
and
the
freight
house.
it
turned
that
work
over
under
the
lease
to
the
southern
pacific
transport
company
and
when
it
did,
it
curtailed
its
forces
to
the
extent
insofar
as
petitioners
are
concerned
in
the
laborers
ranks
by
45
jobs.
it
abolished
those
45
jobs
and
the
petitioners
state
that
the
--
a
notice
was
published.
they
go
on
to
state,
however,
that
his
action
by
the
railroad
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
don't
say
wherein
it
was
violated.
they
don't
point
to
any
specific
provision
but
they
do
say
that
it
was
violated.
they
then
say
that
the
brotherhood
suffered
this
to
transpire
and
did
not
come
to
plaintiff's
aid.
they
further
state
that
the
brotherhood
did
repeatedly
fail
to
hear
them
on
this
grievance.
but
then
they
go
ahead
and
then
the
very
next
paragraph
in
the
complaint,
they
admit
that
the
brotherhood
informed
them.
that
paragraph
is
--
that
i'm
now
referring
to
is
on
page
12
of
the
record
as
a
part
of
paragraph
8.
the
brotherhood
did
inform
them
that
what
had
happened
had
happened
because
of
the
leasing
of
the
potions
of
the
docks
at
the
houston
freight
house
by
the
t.&
n.o.
railroads
to
the
southern
pacific
transport
company
and
that
nothing
could
be
done.
now,
i
submit
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
now
let
me
answer
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
precisely
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice
black.
in
the
howard
case,
the
discrimination
was
affected
under
the
compulsion
of
an
agreement
made
by
the
brotherhood
in
that
case
with
the
railroad
and
deliberately
designed
to
accomplish
the
discrimination.
in
this
phrase,
there
is
not
only
no
agreement
but
i
won't
stand
on
that
ground
alone.
there
was
no
participation
in
the
discrimination
by
the
brotherhood
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
no.
they
do
not
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
your
honor,
i
failed
to
find
a
single
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
no,
sir.
because
they
don't
even
intend
that,
your
honor.
mr.
waddy
doesn't
even
intend
to
state
to
your
honors
today,
that
this
complaint
charges
the
union
with
agreeing
with
the
railroad.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
or
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
may
i
answer
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
your
honor,
the
howard
case
very
clearly
involved
an
agreement
in
a
concert
of
action
and
a
complete
participation
in
by
two
sets
of
parties,
the
railroad
on
the
one
hand
and
the
brotherhood
on
the
other.
they
dissent
and
the
case
went
off
on
the
ground
of
whether
or
not
the
obligation
was
owed
by
the
brotherhood
to
the
petitioners
in
that
case
because
they
weren't
members
of
that
union
and
the
court
held
that
he
have
the
obligation,
the
bargaining
representative
under
the
railway
labor
act
not
to
visit
discrimination
through
the
compulsion
of
an
agreement
on
anybody
whether
he's
a
member
of
his
own
union
or
not.
but
the
basic
distinction
which
i
am
trying
to
stress
in
answer
to
your
question
between
the
howard
case
and
this
case
here
is,
that
all
of
the
discrimination,
every
bit
of
the
discrimination
that
was
practiced
is
alleged
to
have
been
done
by
the
railroad
acting
solely
on
its
own
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
--
not
with
any
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
then
you
raise
squarely
an
issue
which
i
say
is
a
very
difficult
issue
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
--
of
whether
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
alleged
to
that
much.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
did
say
that.
now,
let
--
let
my
answer
that
question.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
dodge
it
but
i
--
i
do
--
i
do
feel
this
way
that
if
that
issue
were
squarely
presented,
if
this
were
a
complaint
that
the
railroad
and
the
union
did
this
either
by
agreement
or
by
conspiracy
or
--
or
that
they
even
jointly
participated
in
this.
if
this
were
such
a
complaint,
then
you
have
before
you,
the
very
difficult
question
of
whether
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
the
steele,
tunstall,
graham
and
howard
cases
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
don't
agree
that
they
have
stated
a
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
actually,
this
is
important
and
that's
why
i
say
the
court
would
be
faced
with
this
issue.
the
steele,
tunstall,
graham,
howard
cases
all
of
your
decisions
and
whether
coincidentally
or
not,
all
dealt
with
the
compulsion
of
an
agreement,
every
one
of
them.
that
is
also
true
of
every
decision
upon
which
petitioner
relies
in
the
lower
courts,
including
the
richardson
case
and
all
the
others.
that
is
not
this
case
even
if
we
go
to
the
point
of
assuming
facts
not
alleged,
not
in
existence
as
mr.
justice
black
asked
me
to
assume.
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
do
not.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
i
would
agree.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
--
and
not
only
agree
to
it
but
i
think
that
points
up
this
case
because
there,
you
have
a
clear
breach
of
a
judiciary
duty
of
the
brotherhood
to
the
members
of
the
craft.
here
you
have
discrimination
practiced
by
railroad
to
--
under
this
complaint
not
even
within
the
knowledge
that
is
discriminate,
and
not
even
within
knowledge
of
the
brotherhood.
there
is
no
claim
that
the
brotherhood
had
anything
to
do
with
the
abolishment
of
the
jobs,
had
anything
to
do
with
the
lease,
had
anything
to
do
with
the
curtailment
on
a
seniority
by
the
southern
pacific
transport
company
when
it
hired
its
own
employees,
had
anything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
white
people
were
hired
and
that
colored
were
not,
or
that
white
people
were
not
fired
and
colored
were.
there
isn't
a
single
allegation
that
the
brotherhood
had
anything
to
do
with
that
and
they
sole
charge
against
the
brotherhood
made
by
this
complaint
is
that
they
suffered
this
to
happen
and
did
come
to
plaintiffs
aid
in
terms
of
preventing
it.
now,
on
that,
let's
deal
with
that
point.
let's
assume
that
they
do
have
some
kind
of
a
duty
to
come
to
their
aid.
that's
why
i
pointed
to
this
particular
paragraph
to
show
that
the
brotherhood
did
just
that.
it
considered
this
problem
and
based
on
its
experience
before
the
adjustment
board
in
cases
of
this
kind
where
a
motor
company,
transport
company
takes
over
operations
formally
approbated
by
a
railroad.
it
concluded
that
it
didn't
have
a
sufficient
claim
against
the
railroad
and
it
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
and
it
so
informed
petitioners.
now,
the
facts
of
the
complaint
itself
showed
that
there's
not
only
--
these
operations
are
now
being
performed,
formerly
performed
by
the
railroad
or
being
performed
by
the
transport
company.
they
also
show
there's
another
union
in
the
picture,
the
teamsters
union
which
petitioners
claim
they're
now
required
to
join
instead
of
the
brotherhood
which
very
clearly
points
up
the
fact
that
the
actual
situation
is
a
lost
of
jurisdiction.
the
operations
of
the
transport
company
and
their
employees
are
not
even
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act,
your
honors.
they
are
clearly
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
any
union
is
in
the
picture,
namely
the
teamsters
representing
these
--
those
employees
as
distinguished
from
railroad
operations
where
the
employees
are
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act
and
represented
by
the
clerk.
now,
i
submit,
it
is
not
logical
to
presume,
that
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks,
either
in
houston
or
anywhere
else
is
going
to,
i
believe,
sit
by
and
watch
its
jobs
being
taken
out
from
under
its
jurisdiction
and
members
taken
out
from
its
union.
and
those
jobs
turned
over
to
another
corporation,
operating
under
a
different
act,
and
operating
in
conjunction
with
a
different
union
if
there's
anything
that
can
do
about
it
to
stop
it.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
where
--
where
is
this,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i
understand
to
allege,
that
we
have
the
duty
to
protect
the
plaintiffs
from
this
discrimination
by
the
railroad.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
understand
it
to
say
that.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
answer
that.
i've
been
trying
to
answer
that
question.
what
could
we
have
done?
we
did
entertain
the
matter.
that's
shown
in
the
complaint.
i'll
find
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
no.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
exactly
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
that
the
--
that
the
complaint
shows
on
its
face
that
the
brotherhood
are
tying
to
protect
it,
actually
listened
to
them
told
them
that
it
didn't
think
that
it
can
do
anything
about
it.
now,
i
submit
this,
your
honors.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
unlike
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
but
they
also
show
that
it
did
and
--
and
didn't
say
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
let's
say
both,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
just
said
is
absolutely
chooses
complaint
does
make
the
contention
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
i'll
be
the
author
of
the
statement
and
i
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
--
the
complaint
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
that
is
my
position.
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
this
is
important
in
the
picture
and
unlike
the
steele
case
where
your
bargaining
representative
has
the
exclusive
authority
in
the
making
of
agreements,
that
in
your
grievance
situation,
your
so-called
minor
grievances
that
although
the
bargaining
representative
does
have
an
obligation
not
to
be
hostile
to
any
members
of
the
craft
because
of
their
color,
he
certainly
has
that
obligation.
nevertheless,
the
bargaining
representative
is
not
compelled
nor
could
he
be
as
a
practical
matter,
to
handle
every
--
every
grievance
presented
up
to
the
channels
on
the
railroad,
to
the
highest
officer
on
the
carrier
and
then
to
the
adjustment
board
regardless
of
the
merit
that
the
bargaining
representative
may
conclude
that
particular
grievance
has.
now,
that
is
necessarily
so
and
there
would
be
chaos
if
every
single
claim
regardless
of
its
merit
that
was
presented
to
the
bargaining
representative
have
to
be
processed
by
him.
as
a
practical
matter,
that
was
the
only
thing
that
the
brotherhood
could
have
done
in
an
accomplished
situation
such
as
we
have
here
in
this
complaint
with
effect
to
abolishment
of
jobs.
but
if
we
look
at
the
situation,
it
concluded
that
the
claim
didn't
have
--
have
merit
or
couldn't
prevail
on
it
before
the
adjustment
board
and
it
refused
to
go
further.
now,
that
is
the
extent
of
its
refusal
to
protect
the
plaintiffs.
now
in
that
situation,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
that
unlike
--
unlike
the
problem
in
steele
and
tunstall
and
howard
unlike
that
problem,
plaintiffs
here
had
an
--
a
remedy
opened
to
them
and
that
remedy
was
to
carry
their
own
claim
if
they
disagreed
with
the
bargaining
representative,
that
it
have
merit.
and
they
still
felt
that
it
did
and
that
the
agreement
had
been
violated,
they
could
carry
that
claim
to
the
adjustment
board
themselves
and
be
represented
in
person
or
be
represented
by
counsel.
section
3
first
(j)
so
expressly
provides
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
situation
you
had
in
your
steele,
tunstall,
and
howard
cases,
where
the
court
was
the
only
avenue
of
redress
and
the
situation
opened
in
these
particular
case.
and
i
wish
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
their
complaint,
your
honor
would
be
against
the
railroad
because
in
substance
that
is
exactly
what
this
amounts
to.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
as
a
practical
matter,
their
complaint
is
against
the
railroad
for
discrimination.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
the
violation
of
the
agreement
as
they
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
--
as
they
contend.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
and
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
go
one
step
further
with
that
question
in
answer
to
a
statement
mr.
waddy
made
about
what
good
does
it
do
them
to
go
there,
their
--
the
people
there
complaining
about
of
the
judges,
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
the
adjustment
board
as
well
as
brotherhoods
have
come
a
long
way,
i
believe,
in
the
railway
labor
field
since
this
court's
decisions
in
steele,
tunstall
and
other
cases.
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
definite
education
that
has
been
gained
from
those
decisions
and
i
submit
that
the
petitioner
should
carry
this
complaint
to
the
adjustment
board
and
have
it
decided.
and
if
they
do
not
get
due
process,
if
there
is
an
arbitrary
handling,
then
that
is
the
time
to
come
before
this
court
and
make
that
very
allegation.
and
if
--
if
i
may
refer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
the
wrightwood
case
decided
last
term,
i
think
it
was
number
56.
he
made
just
that
observation
with
respect
to
a
steele
type
of
situation
that
the
parties
should
go
there.
if
those
are
arbitrary
handling
then
i
feel
they
should
come
before
this
court
and
not
presuppose
that
any
tribunal
is
going
to
act
arbitrarily
or
denied
in
due
process
or
entertain
their
claim.
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
none
as
such,
your
honor
but
in
this
way,
they
could,
which
supports
the
specific
holding
of
the
court
below.
as
i
said,
the
agreement
requires
certain
things
with
respect
to
the
union
shop
provision
to
the
railway
labor
act
and
those
things
required
by
the
agreement
are
consistent
with
the
statute.
so
there
is
no
claim
that
the
statute
is
being
violated.
there
is
a
claim
that
the
agreement
necessarily
being
consistent
with
the
statute
which
petitioners
maintain
says,
so
and
so.
there
is
necessarily
the
claim
that
the
agreement
is
not
being
lived
up
to.
the
railroad
is
a
party
to
that
agreement
as
well
as
the
brotherhood.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
could
bring
that
matter
before
the
adjustment
board
as
a
violation
of
that
agreement
by
the
railroad
because
they
are
just
as
responsible
for
its
administration
as
is
the
brotherhood,
the
other
party
to
the
agreement.
while
i'm
on
that
point,
i
--
i
would
like
to
add
that
the
--
although
petitioners
disclaim
in
their
brief
to
this
court
any
connection
with
the
agreement,
the
complaint
specifically
ask
that
the
bargaining
agreement
be
construed
and
their
rights
declared
by
the
district
court.
it
also
asks
that
the
lease
be
discovered
and
that
its
provisions
and
petitioners
rights
be
declared
and
we
submit
that
under
that
kind
of
--
of
situation
that
obviously,
not
only
as
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved,
it
is
the
very
basis
of
the
petitioner's
cause
of
action
with
respect
to
job
abolishment.
and
that
is
the
matter
which
is
peculiarly
within
the
competence
of
the
railroad
adjustment
board
and
we
believe
that
the
slocum
decision
by
this
court
has
more
vitality
when
you
consider
the
lengths
to
which
this
court
has
gone
when
it
decided
m.k.t.,
the
pitney
case,
and
then
the
slocum
case,
to
point
out
--
and
as
your
honor
made
clear
again
in
likely
last
term.
the
extent
to
which
this
court,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
general
committee
case,
going
back
to
320
u.s.,
made
very
clear
that
the
aim
and
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
industrial
self
administration.
and
that
the
courts
have
been
allowed
in
only
to
a
very
limited
and
necessary
extent.
that
has
been
stressed
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
and
it
is
true
that
in
steele,
you
made
an
exception
the
day
you
have
to
make
an
exception
because
you
said
that
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act
couldn't
go
on
redress
and
that
the
adjustment
board
simply
wasn't
the
tribunal
to
redress
that
kind
of
a
law
and
it
could
obviously,
but
here,
that
is
not
the
case.
and
we
suggest
that
the
slocum
decision
has
much
more
vitality
than
simply
the
suggestion
that
it
concerned
two
unions
quarreling
over
the
jurisdiction.
obviously,
slocum
means
more
that
that.slocum
means
that
where
there
is
basically
and
in
substance
a
dispute
over
a
violation
of
an
agreement
that
that
should
be
taken
to
the
adjustment
board
at
least
for
instance
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
no.
it
isn't
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
it
isn't
true,
your
honor
and
there
are
many
situations
today
where
an
individual
can
still
go
and
have
in
fact
gone.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
well,
they
may
do
it.
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
the
--
with
the
extent
of
that.
i've
heard
they
existed
but
--
mr.
edward
j.
hickey,
jr.
--
they
may
do
it
to
the
equivalent
of
powers
of
attorney
to
represent.
now,
once
they
do
that
sort
of
thing
which
this
brotherhood
has
not
done,
then
they
assume
an
obligation
to
represent.
but
in
--
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
the
individual,
when
it
disagrees
with
the
bargaining
representative's
interpretation
of
the
merits
of
a
claim
can
process
that
himself
and
get
an
adjudication
of
it.
and
if
he
doesn't
get
a
fair
adjudication
of
it
then
i
think
he
can
come
into
the
court.
otherwise,
to
the
simple
expedient,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
of
living
out
a
railroad
as
a
defendant
in
a
situation
where
they
clearly
are
the
party
perpetrating
the
discrimination
and
there
is
no
--
no
question
of
that
under
this
complaint.
that
they
are
the
party,
the
--
the
complaint
doesn't
even
claim
anything
more
than
that
--
we
should
have
been
protected
from
that
discrimination.
now,
where
that
is
so,
we
feel
that
the
slocum
case
can't
be
avoided
to
the
simple
expedient
dropping
a
party
defendant.
otherwise,
the
case
becomes
a
shamble.
thank
you
very
much.
