justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
waddy,
would
it
interfere
with
what
you
had
planned
to
put
before
the
court
if
you
told
us
at
the
outset
exactly
what
the
facts
are
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
human
fact
and
what
it
means
and
what
it
doesn't
mean
before
we
get
on
to
this
--
to
me
still
very
difficult
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
the
maintenance
of
these
two
locals,
would
you
mind
telling
us
how
these
two
locals
came
into
existence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
this
was
an
old
condition
when
the
railway
labor
act
was
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let's
see
if
i
understand
this
because
this
can
be
either
important
thing.
when
--
for
how
many
years
of
the
collective
bargain
--
the
agreement
run,
two
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
isn't
it
renewed,
subject
to
renew?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
get
30
days
notice
if
--
if
notice
is
given
that
there's
desire
to
wage
increase,
what
--
how
is
it
going
--
how
is
the
collective
bargaining
process
gone
about
since
1951?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
but
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
if
any
bargaining
is
done
with
the
--
with
the
railroad
at
the
lower
level,
that
it's
all
done
by
the
--
by
local
28.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
--
what
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
bargaining
from
which
if
i
understood
you,
the
negro
local
is
excluded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
give
us
a
specific
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
seniority
questions,
none?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
suppose
--
suppose
the
6051
wants
to
have
a
change
in
the
--
in
the
existing
terms
about
seniority.
what
would
it
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
if
--
but
suppose
the
membership
of
6051
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
either
some
wrong
to
be
righted,
what
can
they
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
have
to
stay
to
the
--
whatever
the
person
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
do
this
for
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
let
me
see
if
i
can
pin
this
down.
if
local
--
if
the
colored
members
of
the
craft
have
some
--
feel
some
wrong
to
them
or
they
want
to
have
a
change
of
terms
on
the
local
level,
they
would
have
to
go
through
local
28.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
local
28
would
decide
whether
they
would
take
it
up
with
the
railroad
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
they
do
take
it
up,
how
many
would
there
be,
two
or
three
in
the
committee,
whatever
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
representative
of
6051
wouldn't
participate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
i
wanted
to
know
physically
or
actually,
what
takes
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
20
--
if
6051
says,
we
want
to
change
the
prevailing
lunch
hour
or
the
run,
some
local
run,
he
would
have
to
apply
to
the
chairman
of
28
and
28
would
decide
whether
it
should
be
taken
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
is
taken
up
and
they
sit
down
and
--
and
discuss
with
the
railroad,
approach
the
opposite
number
on
the
railroad,
28
exclusively
would
sit
in
and
not
6051.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
election
or
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
the
standing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
6051
elect
--
suppose
they
vote
against
him.
they
can't
outvote
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
all
the
answers
you
gave
to
these
--
to
these
concrete
questions,
are
they
said
--
are
they
part
of
the
complaint?
were
they
part
--
were
they
before
the
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
you
about
the
brief.
are
they
before
in
the
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
centrally,
your
position
is
that
you're
being
discriminated
against.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
all
these
questions
that
have
been
asked
of
you
go
to
the
question
of
what
is
--
what
is
the
operating
discrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
in
turn
may
depend
on
what
the
facts
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
should
go
before
the
railway
board
or
it
can
go
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
waddy,
may
i
ask
you,
what
relief
you
--
you
asked
for
in
your
complaint?
what
is
it
the
federal
court
that
you
want
the
federal
court
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
the
phrases
and
neither
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
one
or
two
questions.
you
do
not
ask
if
the
two
unions
should
be
called
and
asked
into
one
union.
the
--
you
were
asked
if
the
two
--
if
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
two
unions
is
wrong
under
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
don't
asked
that
the
white
craft
members
and
the
colored
class
members
be
all
comprised
under
one
local,
say
local
28
and
6051
will
be
abolished,
you
don't
asked
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
is
the
number
of
--
what
is
the
membership
of
local
28
in
number?
justice
felix
frankfurter
about,
larger
or
smaller
than
the
colored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
larger.
now,
suppose
--
suppose
they
say,
“very
well,
you
don't
like
to
be
in
a
union,
by
a
--
in
a
local
by
yourself
we'll
include
you,
we'll
make
one
union.
and
all
of
men
who
are
now
in
6051
would
become
members
of
local
28.”
and
then
a
question
arose
as
between
white
and
colored
members
of
one
union
and
the
white's
outvoted
you.
could
you
have
a
remedy
in
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
not
ask,
you
do
not
ask
the
abolition
of
6051
and
your
inclusion
in
local
28,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
if
--
whatever
is
you're
asked
for,
the
pressure
will
be
such
as
a
consequence
that
they'll
have
to
heed
you
more,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
do
not
go
against
the
segregation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
not
go
against
the
fact
of
the
segregation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
in
this
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
in
this
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
ask
for
the
declaratory
judgment
that
that
be
deemed
violative
of
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
ask
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that,
mr.
waddy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
--
in
your
complaint
or
your
prayer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
ask
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
--
perhaps
it's
appropriate
at
this
point
to
ask
your
comment
on
the
fact
if
--
i
believe
it's
a
fact,
that
congress
was
--
that
congress
refused
to
--
to
provide
explicitly
for
the
prohibition
of
such
segregation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
making
comment
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
have
gone
to
the
adjustment
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
on
--
about
that
for
which
you
complain
namely,
that
the
chairman
of
28
and
sitting
down
with
the
texas
railroad
people
didn't
have
in
mind
and
consciously,
purposely
excluded
from
his
consideration
grievances
that
you
had,
your
clients
had.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
well,
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
you
get
on
to
the
other.
could
that
question
have
been
brought
before
the
adjustment
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
--
the
adjustment
board
has
the
only
complaint
against
the
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
but
could
you
go
to
the
adjustment
board
and
say,
the
carrier
in
collaboration
with
28
shutout
grievances
that
you
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
with
such
an
allegation
go
before
the
adjustment
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
the
carrier
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
carrier
here
--
the
carrier
here
has
no
business
to
negotiate
with
28
knowing,
i'm
assuming
i
don't
know
any
of
the
facts,
knowing
that
some
of
the
craft
were
not
represented
but
misrepresented
as
it
were
by
local
28
chairman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
grievance
before
the
adjustment
board,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
not
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
under
the
contract
of
--
you've
got
an
underlying
right
to
be
treated
on
inequality
with
everybody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
insofar
as
racial
discriminations
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
not
grievance
you
could
bring
before
the
adjustment
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
all
--
what
steele
held
was,
if
i
understand
it,
that
the
collective
bargaining
--
those
who
have
authority
to
bargain
for
all
the
members
of
a
particular
craft
within
the
railroad
world
must
fairly
represent
--
must
represent
all
the
members
of
the
craft
at
least
to
the
extent
of
not
making
a
differentiation
on
the
basis
of
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say,
that
under
the
act
of
1951
not
only
your
member
of
a
craft
but
you
must
be
a
member
of
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
a
fortiori
as
a
member
of
the
union,
you
are
to
be
bargained
for
on
the
same
basis
as
the
white
local
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
--
are
you
implying
that
this
complaint
couldn't
have
been
cured
by
bill
of
particulars
or
by
--
or
are
there
motion
--
a
motion
to
make
it
more
particular
would
have
been
futile
because
it
has
an
inherent
defect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
non-jurisdiction,
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
have
to
say,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
add
7
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right
there,
mr.
hickey.
this
last
--
this
last
inadequacy
it
could
be
one
--
that
could
be
--
that
could
be
amended
by
saying
from
january
so
and
so
to
october
so
and
so,
wouldn't
that
--
would
such
an
allegation
take
care
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
we
could
know
whether
there
is
or
isn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
provided
it's
amendable
to
make
it
more
particular.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
jurisdiction
and
--
and
the
case
is
here
only
on
the
--
on
your
first
generalize
statement.
it
means
that
no
amount
of
--
that
the
mandatory
power
of
the
district
court,
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
allow
plaintiff
to
amend
couldn't
possibly
--
couldn't
fairly
cure
the
--
the
generality
of
their
allegation,
isn't
it?
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hickey,
we're
in
days
when
pleading
can
be
awfully
free
and
easy
so
long
as
essential
was
stated.
would
you
be
good
enough
to
turn
to
page
9
of
the
record,
roman
paragraph
7
in
which
i
find
this
sentence,
“the
plaintiffs
and
those
whom
they
represent
have
been
compelled
to
join
local
6051,
solely
because
they
are
members
of
the
negro
race.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
doesn't
mean
they
couldn't
join
all
the
events,
why
isn't
that
enough
to
indicate
that
they're
in
6051
because
they
couldn't
be
in
28?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
do
it
--
they
do
it
the
other
way
around.
there
is
what
the
new
york
lawyers
call
a
negative
pregnant
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
takes
us
to
justice
black's
suggestion.that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
can't
make
good
on
this
allegation.
namely,
that
they
were
--
if
--
if
i
can
compel
to
join
one
club
presumably
would
the
differentiation
there
is
it
isn't
too
big
a
jump
to
imply
couldn't
have
joined
the
other
club?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
saying
it
isn't
so,
it
isn't
such
a
--
such
a
negation,
it
isn't
such
a
--
it
doesn't
need
so
much
room
that
i
could
have
joined
that
you
can't
allow
me
to
amend
that
statement.
but
if
i
said,
i
had
to
join
this
particular
club
in
a
law
school,
you
might
say,
“couldn't
you
have
join
the
other
one?”
and
i
might
say
yes
or
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
so
unrelated
to
say,
“i
was
compelled
to
join
local
6051,
that
the
inference
is
that
i
couldn't
join
28.”
particularly,
when
you
deal
with
the
subject
about
which
one
has
some
judicial
notice.
i'm
not
questioning
mr.
harrison's
attitude
or
that
of
anybody
else.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
central
thing,
namely,
is
there
nothing
here
on
which
the
court
could
have
fastened
its
authority
by
appropriate
amendment
of
the
pleadings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hickey,
i'm
sorry
that
i
have
to
ask
you
so
many
questions
but
i
think
this
is
the
domain
which
is
so
ticklish
that
questions
and
answers
bring
out
the
point.
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
chief
justice's
question.his
question
was
supposed
they
had
said
explicit
that
they
couldn't
join
or
they
have
compelled
to
join
6051
because
they
weren't
allowed
to
join
28.
you
said
that
--
that
would
be
--
that
isn't
what
is
alleged,
but
you
said
even
that
wouldn't
state
a
justiciable
question
--
controversy
because
you
say,
congress
by
not
legislating
that,
didn't
make
that
a
protected
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
want
to
ask
you
this.
assume
that
were
alleged
explicitly
and
it
went
on
and
said,
“because
we're
in
a
segregated
union,
the
chairman
of
the
28,
the
28
dominates
the
bargaining
and
by
dominating,
not
giving
us
a
voice
in
it,
subordinates
and
denies
some
of
our
equality
of
rights,”
would
that
have
been
a
good
--
good
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know,
is
there
nothing
in
your
view
in
this
complaint
on
which
one
can
say
enough
is
said
even
though
not
with
particularity
that
they
do
not
need
to
raise
the
abstract
question
of
segregation
but
they
use
that's
made
of
the
segregation
and
the
use
that's
made
of
it
disadvantages
them
in
the
things
that
matter
to
railroad
employees,
lunch
hour,
runs,
seniority,
etcetera.
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
there
by
which
they
say
because
of
the
segregation
that
they
had
disadvantage
in
view
of
the
fact
that
28
does
all
the
bargaining
and
they're
not
to
use
it?
do
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
say
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
have
to
say
it
in
order
to
sustain
one
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
i
get
out
of
the
complaint,
mr.
hickey.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
--
i
think
to
disclose
by
mine
quite
completely,
i
think,
i
get
enough
of
intermission
or
emanation
to
indicate
the
contrary
not
that
this
or
that
particular
thing
but
of
the
process
discriminates
against
them
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
haven't
done
or
locate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
get
out
of
the
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
add
another
complication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
take
the
railroad
out
altogether.
suppose,
the
railroad
is
itself,
the
coerced
actor
at
the
behest
of
a
brotherhood,
i'm
not
saying
it
so
it's
conceivable
that
the
railroad
may
find
itself
willing
not
to
discriminate
but
a
brotherhood
may
ask
it
not
unhistorical
that
was
the
situation
not
so
many
years
ago.
would
that
be
within
or
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
if
the
railroad
act
--
if
the
railroad
was
willing,
was
eager
not
to
discriminate
but
felt
itself
under
difficulties
through
the
pressure
of
a
brotherhood,
wouldn't
that
be
within
the
steele
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
want
to
take
out
the
notion
if
there
has
to
be
a
conspiracy
between
the
railroad
and
the
--
and
the
brotherhood.you
will
agree
to
that,
wouldn't
you
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
what
they
have
stated.
i'm
talking
about
the
proposition
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
howard,
whatever
made
in
the
fact
at
howard,
the
fact
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
brotherhood
and
railroad
it's
just
an
additional
factor
in
case
it
was
decided
according
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
facts
of
the
case.
but
i
think
if
the
union
--
if
the
union,
as
a
matter
of
practice
is
this
and
the
railroad
ascended
because
it
had
not
practical
choice,
that
wouldn't
make
a
difference,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
stand
on
that
as
a
requirement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
stand
on
the
legal
proposition
that
if
in
fact
the
brotherhood,
if
in
fact
the
brotherhood
only
apart
from
agreement
with
the
railroad
as
a
matter
of
its
own
brotherhood
policy,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
exerts
its
authority
as
a
bargaining
agent,
discriminatorily
against
colored
members
of
a
colored
local
or
no
local
at
all.
that
would
be
within
this
field,
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
really
is,
if
i
understand
you.
what
you're
saying
is
not
only
that
they
didn't
sufficiently
state
their
case
with
concreteness.
but
you're
saying
they
affirmatively
alleged
themselves
out
of
course,
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
--
what
they
did
allege
(voice
overlap)
affirmatively
shows
there
is
no
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
you
have
to
maintain?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
so
characterizing.
i'm
so
characterizing
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i've
said
that
but
that's
--
that
was
--
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hickey,
before
the
question
the
chief
justice
put
to
you
namely,
couldn't
these
petitioners
go
to
the
adjustment
board
then
set
their
individual
interest.
i
ask
the
knowledge.
certainly,
that
was
true
under
elgin,
the
elgin
case.
but
as
i
understand
it,
a
number
of
the
brotherhood
change
their
constitution
after
elgin
and
practically
displaced
what
elgin
did.
i
don't
know
whether
your
brotherhood
was
among
those
but
that
is
true,
as
you
will
know
that
the
elgin
--
the
effect
of
the
elgin
decision
is
practically
a
dead
letter
for
most
of
the
important
railway
union
brotherhood,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
to
--
and
under
that,
the
individual
couldn't
go.
the
brotherhood
itself
would
have
to
assert
the
individuals
rights.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
railway
steamship
clerks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
all
depends
--
all
depends
as
i
understand
it,
what
the
constitutional
relationship
between
the
individual
member
and
the
brotherhood.
not
that
those
constitutional
changes
of
the
brotherhood
that
--
that
have
been
before
us
but
i
--
i
find
it
difficult
under
elgin
to
think
that
they
wouldn't
be
sustained.
however,
there
is
that
practical
situation
that
railway
would,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
most
of
the
brotherhood
or
at
least
the
leading
once
have
barred
the
individual
from
raising
questions
under
the
agreement
by
the
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
matter
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
urge
that
if
this
--
if
this
complaint
unfound
nothing
except
the
way
you
just
interpreted
compelled,
namely,
that
there
is
a
white
local
and
a
colored
local
period.
no
more.
not
what
the
consequences
are,
not
the
uses
to
which
that
is
put
but
merely
the
fact
that
you're
compelled
to
join
a
colored
local.
would
you
regard
that
--
would
you
regard
that
that
stated
a
cause
of
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
don't
go
beyond
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
you
to
address
yourself
for
the
moment
of
an
allegation
or
complaint
that
is
boiled
on
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
compelled
segregated
colored
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
on
what
legal
theory,
on
what
legal
--
what's
the
right
that
would
have
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
certainly
say
it
would
have
been
the
requirement
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
what
this
court
said
in
the
howard
case
that
the
union
could
not
use
the
provisions
of
the
statute
or
to
discriminate.
now,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
discriminate
is
merely
--
in
the
make
up,
the
racial
make
up
of
the
two
unions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
even
affirmatively,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
all
--
they
all
get
the
same
wages,
the
same
seniority
rights,
everything.
you
would
regard
merely,
there
compel
--
compulsory
maintenance
of
a
segregated
union
in
and
of
itself
is
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
it
will
go
to
the
constitution.
