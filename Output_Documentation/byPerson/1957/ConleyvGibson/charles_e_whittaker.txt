justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
waddy?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
an
action
for
damages,
for
past
breach
of
duty
brought
by
the
former
employee
pilots?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
not
(voice
overlap)
damages
and
an
injunction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
what
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
wouldn't
take
care
of
the
action
for
damages?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hickey,
if
i
may
ask
for
understanding
please.
is
it
not
true
that
while
the
complaint
contained
a
prayer
for
several
types
of
relief
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
you
was
based
on
several
grounds.
yet,
the
only
grounds
sustain
by
the
court
was
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
this
case
was
vested
in
the
railway
labor
board.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
is
it
quite
correct
then
to
say
that
you
contend
that
even
if
there
was
jurisdiction,
no
cause
of
action
here
has
been
stated.
isn't
the
only
question
that's
before
us
is
whether
there
was
jurisdiction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
failure
to
state
facts
sufficient
to
constitute
a
cause
of
action?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
all
is
decided
by
the
court
below
is
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
in
the
railway
labor
board.
