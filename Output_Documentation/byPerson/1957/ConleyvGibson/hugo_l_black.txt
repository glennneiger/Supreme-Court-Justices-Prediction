justice

l.

are
you
saying
there
that
assuming
if
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
it
had
properly
stated
the
cause
of
action
of
discrimination
they
have
failed
here,
the
facts
are
not
sufficiently
show
a
cause
of
action
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
that
go
to
jurisdiction?
why
does
that
not
go
sufficient
to
the
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
might
state
for
myself
that
i
would
much
further
if
you
argue
that
for
delaying
for
this
reason,
i
might
state
what's
in
my
mind.
if
there's
an
amendable
detail
it
really
just
a
failure
to
say
the
cause
of
action
in
a
proper
language
and
fixing
charges,
i
would
find
it
rather
difficult
to
say
with
--
state
in
the
court
a
complete
and
total
dismissal
of
the
case,
i'm
talking
about
court,
the
claim
can
be
reached
by
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
interested
in
your
discussion
as
to
the
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
going
to
point
out
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
made
up
to
that
particular
part
of
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
leave
--
you
leave
at
the
words
“persistently
and
inconsistently”.
are
you
saying
that
the
complaint
does
not
charge
as
they
have
carried
out
a
program
of
abolishing
jobs
and
then
reinstating
so
as
to
keep
them
from
getting
back
into
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
claim
that
it
does
not
(voice
overlap)--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
demur
to
this
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
allege
an
application
and
the
refusal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course,
the
thing
that
i
get
--
i
don't
like
to
interrupt
you
but
the
thing
i
get
back
to
you,
if
it's
amendable
in
that
respect
and
that's
just
one
allegation
that's
needed
to
make
it
a
--
and
you
admitted
to
give
jurisdiction.
would
we
be
justified
in
saying
if
the
court
had
a
right
to
draw
it
out
entirely
on
the
ground
without
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
they
amended
it
just
to
say
exactly
what
you
said?
would
it
--
would
the
court
then
have
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
they
couldn't
prove
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
say,
you
mean
they
couldn't
prove
it.
but
suppose
they
alleged
it
even
though
they
didn't
prove
it.
could
the
court
dismiss
the
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
would
it
have
to
by
some
kind
of
a
preliminary
pretrial
or
trial
to
decide
against
them
on
that
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
all
they
alleged.
they
alleged
that
jobs
were
abolished.
no
other
jobs
were
abolished
except
those
held
by
negroes
that
the
next
thing
is
that
jobs
which
were
all
freight
house
were
not
abolished
from
persons
who
were
immediately
hired
to
perform
said
jobs
doing
the
same
type
of
work,
same
class
of
work
had
been
--
had
been
done
before
that
the
white
people
were
all
replaced
but
no
colored
man
was
replaced
that
this
was
done
they
say,
that
another
colored
people
was
subjected
and
none
the
white
people
was
subjected
to
this
provisions
that
they
alleged
on
page
13.
that
their
jobs
were
not
abolished
to
white
people
not
compelled
to
join
international
brotherhood
and
all
this
was
done
on
account
of
a
planned
course
of
conduct
designed
to
discriminate
against
negroes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
doesn't
that
fit
the
howard
case
almost
precisely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
say
there
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
the
complaint
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
say
about
the
union
defendant
and
they
just
say
that
all
of
these
happened
as
a
result
of
a
planned
course
of
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
could
be
if
--
if
that's
not
sufficiently
different,
if
i'm
wrong
in
thinking,
it's
pretty
clear
the
definition,
not
sufficiently
different
that
one
additional
cause
could
be
added
very
easy
could
it?
say
that's
not
merely
that
the
union,
instead
of
saying
it
--
it
was
a
plan
course
of
conduct
they
could
add
the
word
by
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
agreeing
with
the
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
they
agreed
with
the
railroad
and
did
it
themselves.
i
don't
see
where
that
would
make
any
difference
and
i
thought
we
said
so
in
howard.
the
dissenters
there
took
the
view
that
because
these
people
were
not
members
of
the
union,
they
could
--
they
were
told
duty
to
protect
and
--
but
they
--
even
the
dissenting
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
howard
case
would
support
the
view
that
the
plaintiffs
alleged
here
enough
to
--
for
the
court
to
--
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
alleged
the
abolishment
of
jobs
that
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
depriving
these
colored
people
out
there
that
it
did
do
that
and
indemnify
any
of
the
white
people
as
all
part
of
the
plan
course
of
conduct
to
achieve
that
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you're
wrong
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
you're
wrong
in
that
and
the
complaint
is
enough.
say
that
they're
charging
the
union
with
this
discrimination,
would
the
court
have
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
difficult
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
light
of
howard?
what
we
said
there
was,
as
previously
noted,
this
train
workers
are
threatened
the
lost
of
their
job
because
they
are
not
white
and
for
no
other
reason,
is
that
not
alleged
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
say
is,
if
they
do
not
say
the
union
did
it
but
that
they
are
charging
the
railroad
and
bring
a
suit
against
the
union
although
they
charged
at
the
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
ask
you
this?
what
do
you
understand
this
(inaudible)
mean?
that
by
reason
of
the
said
act,
if
that's
the
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
13.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
white
people
have
lost
their
jobs.
many
of
the
colored
people
have
and
that
there's
no
--
have
been
no
real
abolishment
it's
just
an
effort
to
conceal
it.
and
then,
that
by
reason
of
the
said
act
that
written
continuation
and
the
refusal
of
defendant
or
any
event
to
get
the
plaintiff
protection
or
any
protection
said
discrimination,
equal
to
that
i
quoted,
“the
members
of
the
white
race
of
the
craft
represented
by
the
brotherhood
of
railway
steamship
clerks.”
defendant,
union
and
each
of
them
have
breached
the
statutory
duty
imposed
in
45
u.s.
code
which
duty
is
to
protect
plaintiff
from
any
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color.
what
do
you
understand
that
to
allege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
much
as
you
did
white
people
and
that
you
had
failed
to
perform.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
of
proof
isn't
it?
in
other
words
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
can't
prove
this,
they
have
no
case.
if
they
can
prove
that,
wouldn't
they
be
entitled
to
--
have
a
case
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
precisely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
alleged
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
alleged
that
it
could
and
did
not.
they
alleged
that
it
could
have
and
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
do
show
and
let
him
talk
to
them
and
told
them
they
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
and
they
say
it
could
have
but
it
just
wouldn't
try?
