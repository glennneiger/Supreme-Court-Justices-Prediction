mr.

you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief

three
weeks
or
three
years,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
three
weeks.
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
quinlan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
that
mean
in
dollars?
what
would
--
would
a
third
of
his
wages
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
--
what
was
his
daily
wage?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
include
his
keep,
too?
would
they
give
a
third
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
didn't,
did
he--
did
get
about
30
cents
a
day,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
saying
the
equivalent
of
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
what
i
was
wondering
is
this.
how
about
the
$3000
hospital
bill
and
these
other
expenses
for
maintenance
and
cure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
--
does
he
get
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
that
that
he
paid
the
--
that
they
paid
the
bill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
is
that
the
answer
by
counterpart?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
answer
to
my
question
then
is
that
the
company
will
pay
his
hospital
bill
of
$3000
or
whatever
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
the
one
--
you're
the
one
who
determined
when
he
was
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
doctor
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
say
he
was
cured?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
his
doctor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
what
--
let
me
just
ask
you
as
a
practical
matter
because
you've
been
saying
what
he
would
get.
if
--
if
this
man
gets
a
pension
at
the
rate
of
about
30
cents
a
day
and
this
entire
hospital
bill
is
not
paid,
and
he
has
lost
one
leg
and
has
other
serious
injuries
from
which
he
might
not
yet
be
cured,
that
compensation
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
go
very
far,
would
it,
taking
care
of
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
until
--
until
he
said
he
was
ready
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
leave
--
until
you
said
he
was
ready
to
leave.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
that
one
thing
to
say
that
a
man
could
travel
back
to
spain
in
an
entirely
different
thing
to
say
that
he's
cured?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
which
of
these
doctors
say?
did
his
doctor
say
he
was
cured
or
he
could
travel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
spain?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
couldn't
put
a
wooden
leg
on
yet?
chief
justice
earl
warren
enjoying
might
be
a
rather
broad
term
to
use
in
those
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
enjoying
this
proceeding
might
be
a
rather
broad
term
to
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
man
with
one
leg
gone
and
other
--
other
bad
injuries,
enjoying
might
be
a
little
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
too
broad.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
quinlan,
you
said
very
little
about
garcia.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
haven't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mentioned
it
at
all,
have
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
isn't
that
of
some
importance
to
this
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
thing
that
i
was
wondering
about,
if
they
did
state
the
cause
of
action
in
their
complaint,
whether
it
be
under
the
jones
act
or
under
a
maritime
--
maritime
law,
is
--
is
that
a
matter
for
summary
judgment
or
isn't
that
a
matter
that
they're
entitled
to
go
to
trial
on
to
determine
in
the
--
in
those
trials
whether
he
--
he
was
in
that
--
could
serve
in
that
capacity
and
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
whatever
the
relationship
--
is
in
the
relationship,
there's
something
which
should
be
tried
on
the
trial
and
not
--
and
not
in
pretrial
proceedings.
it's
a
part
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it's
a
defense
--
if
it's
a
defense,
wouldn't
that
have
to
be
pleaded
and
--
and
proved
that
he
--
he
was
not
in
that
relationship
to
the
plaintiff?
how
does
that
come
up
or
how
does
that
come
up
on
--
on
pretrial?
that's
a
thing
that
bothered
me
at
moment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no
it's
my
--
my
point
is
this.
by
--
by
virtue
of
what
right
does
a
judge
do
that
on
pretrial
if
their
complaint
states
the
cause
of
action,
states
the
relationship
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
that
could
make
the
defendant
liable,
should
the
judge
try
that
on
pre-trial
or
isn't
that
a
part
of
the
case
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
what
he
did
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
should
do
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
the
judge
decide
here
that
there
was
no
such
relationship
and
therefore
--
therefore
they
couldn't
go
to
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
--
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
what
i
(inaudible)
mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
take
three
minutes
more
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
afraid
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
