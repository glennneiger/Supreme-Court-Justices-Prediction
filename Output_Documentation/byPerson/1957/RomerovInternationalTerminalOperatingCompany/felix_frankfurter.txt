jurisdiction
meaning
that
if
he
had
ever
abandoned
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
said
he
was
upsetting
is
without
power
to
entertain
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
am
not
speaking
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
was
meant
by
jurisdiction.
does
it
mean
that,
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
by
sustaining
judge
sugarman's
disposition
in
the
district
court,
did
that
imply
that
if
he
had
entertained
a
suit,
the
court
of
appeals
would
issue
a
prohibition?
not
from
your
point
of
view,
but
from
their
point
of
view.
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
jurisdiction
means
in
short.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
there
are
many
questions
in
admiralty
law
which
can
be
dismissed
by
the
district
court
without
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
they
can
get
all
together
and
it
should
not
be
heard
and
yet
if
he
entertained
it,
it
would
not
be
prohibited
in
that
he
had
no
power,
because
jurisdiction
here
means
power
or
with
due
regard
with
the
admiralty
law
it
should
not
be
heard,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
plaintiff
is
not
the
master
of
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
the
plaintiff
is
not
a
master
or
--
the
master
of
his
litigation
in
the
sense
that
if
he
discloses
he
could
possibly
remit
it
to
the
courts
of
the
nationality
that
he
isn't
allowed
to
contend.
that
you
must
have
a
trial
which
we
develop
the
fact,
presumably
not
otherwise,
than
they
were
developed
at
pretrial.
what
is
pretrial
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
so?
in
admiralty
there
is
power
that
does
not
have
to
be
exercised
and
you
must
go
through
a
long
trial
instead
of
doing
it
in
pretrial,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
he
says
jones
act
is
the
compliant
and
pretrial
--
there
is
no
basis
for
the
jones
act
or
on
the
theory,
on
the
allowable
discretionary
authority
of
the
court
of
admiralty
you
can
remit
it
to
the
home
court,
nevertheless
you
must
have
a
trial,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
i
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
a
danish
or
british
or
an
irish
or
a
swedish
seaman
working
for
a
non-american
steamship
company
or
an
employer
cannot
sign
off
articles
whereby
his
rights
are
all
determined
by
--
what
i
know
and
i
have
reason
to
take
this
correct
from
the
other
nationals
have
better
protection
than
the
jones
act.
is
that
right?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
you
â€“
it's
just
one
of
your
(inaudible)
arguments.
counsel
very
often
would
help
us.
if
they
state
what
their
proposition
is
and
then
argue
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
time
a
foreign
ship
having
foreignly
articles,
seamen
aboard
makes
a
call
at
any
port
in
united
states
and
anything
happens
the
john
act
applies.
that
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
know
what
sham
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sham
means
they
do
not
want
to
be
governed
by
the
jones
act.
is
that
sham?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
infer
that
justice
mcreynolds
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
claim
of
general
maritime
how
it
was
for
--
and
it
is
your
contention
that
district
court
does
not
have
and
i'd
say
district
court
does
not
have
a
situation
like
this,
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
how
that
if
all
the
facts
were
admitted
court
of
appeals
petition
for
remission
against
the
(inaudible)
or
that
it
is
within
the
general
--
that
it
is
within
a
considerably
wide
domain
in
which,
although
as
a
matter
of
power
the
district
court
proceed
itself
without
having
to
decide
the
litigation
the
considerations
(inaudible)
it
could
use
to
produce
or
and
limit
the
litigations
with
appropriate
power
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
as
a
matter
of
power,
the
district
court
by
the
limitation
against
that
governs
a
district
court,
it
couldn't
even
if
it's
all
the
equity
loosely
speaking
(inaudible)
listing
out
in
a
federal
court,
it
couldn't
as
a
matter
of
strict
limitations
such
as
trying
to
give
authority
to
the
district
court,
take
hold
of
this
litigation
under
the
general
maritime
law,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
this
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
talking
about
jones
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
general
maritime
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
should
not
be
applied
or
it
cannot
be
applied,
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
result
may
be
the
same,
but
jurisdiction,
one
of
these
loose
words
had
always
failed
to
amend
that,
doesn't
make
a
difference,
i
think
the
outcome
(inaudible)
--
require
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
court's
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
survivorship
on
spanish
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
survivorship
for
the
widow
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
lauritzen
case
it's
signed
at
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
point
--
what
that
court
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no
but
the
fact
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
so
in
his
opinion,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
so
in
his
opinion,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
so
in
his
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
the
admiralty
question?
(inaudible)
--
what
would
be
the
fold
that
had
a
pledge,
fold
that
had
the
(inaudible)
before
judge
sugarman
that
there
would
be
no
relief
under
spanish
law,
no
relief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
spanish
law
or
whatever
that
this
seaman
would
be
out
completely
unless
there
was
basis
for
giving
him
relief,
the
american
evidence,
i
am
putting
the
jones
act
to
understand,
could
he
have
taken
jurisdiction
on
the
general
admiralty
system?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
relations
in
your
experience
under
the
jones
act
and
general
admiralty
law,
both
(inaudible)
that
jones
act
does
not
give
him
any
statutory
relief,
for
that
assume
that,
i
do
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
american
admiralty
law
having
the
sole
discretionary
law
making
so
to
speak
but
it
does
have
beginning
fundamentally
with
the
(inaudible),
what
i
want
to
know
is
as
a
matter
of
how
if
this
case
had
shown
there
was
no
relief,
no
remedy
under
the
spanish
law,
would
the
american
admiralty
court
be
complelled
to
throw
him
out
and
say
that
under
our
(inaudible)
he
can't
get
any
relief
here
although
all
the
damage
was
done
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
i
just
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
many
managing
contracts
that
the
admiralty
court
doesn't
respect
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i,
unless
it's
off
the
rail,
could
he
bring
suit
against
those
with
whom
he
might
make
a
diversity
case
in
the
federal
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
accepted
claim
by
which
you
or
your
client
could
join?
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
that
be
persuaded
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
(inaudible)
the
claim
would
be
general
admiralty
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
new
york
against
negligence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
whatever
rights
he
may
or
may
not
have
against
the
other
be
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
case
is
coming
up
in
another
situation,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
problem,
that's
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
not
been
urged
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
statistics
in
the
district
court
(inaudible)
was
not
pending.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
please
tell
us
why,
what
may
be
an
irrelevant
curiosity
on
my
part,
is
this
seaman,
if
he
remained,
if
he's
still
in
the
united
states
that
maybe
under
the
immigration
law
was
allowed
to
stay
in
the
united
states?
this
--
this
may
be
an
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
technically
one
--
his
business
--
whatever
they
call
it,
a
visitor
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
--
may
i
interrupt
you
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
still,
this
open
the
question
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
1331.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wish
i
had
in
gully
but
mr.
justice
cardozo
wrote
it.
