if
that
would
be
true,
(inaudible)
one
may
be
there
and
one
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
--
where
do
we
find
that
in
your
brief?
is
that
in
your
brief
that
we
have
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon
me,
sir?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
that?
you
referred
to
it
several
times,
their
wage
in
a
certain
sum.
how
much
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
how
much
--
you
said
there
was
certain
sum
awaiting
him
for
life.
how
much
is
it,
if
there's
a
certain
sum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know.
how
much
is
it?
does
the
record
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
life
expectancy?
for
life,
you're
saying.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
yet
i
fully
understood,
maybe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
maybe
you
and
your
--
the
other
side
could
agree
to
give
us
a
statement
that
is
relevant
perhaps
only
in
connection
with
the
argument
made
as
to
the
purpose
to
bring
about
an
equalization
of
the
treatment
of
a
foreign
seaman
and
american
seaman
with
references
to
wages
and
compensation
there
was.
but
as
i
understand
you,
what
he'd
get
under
the
spanish
law
is
30
cents
--
about
30
cents
a
day,
nothing
for
support
except
the
30
cents
a
day
during
the
time
that
the
board
found
he
was
wholly
--
wholly
disqualified
from
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
there's
an
--
it's
an
automatic
--
he's
automatically
entitled
to
30
cents
a
day
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you.
i
--
that's
what
i
want
to
find.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he's
covered
by
the
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he's
covered
by
the
act
which
is
the
basic
question
you're
arguing,
i
don't
suppose
you'd
claim
that
you
could
evade
his
right,
but
agreeing
you
could
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
if
they
had
covered
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
basically
whether
the
law
of
spain
govern
as
he
agreed
or
whether
he
doesn't
depends
on
whether
the
jones
act
covered
him,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
treaty
that
affects
this
in
anyway?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
from
your
standpoint
then,
it's
only
a
question
statutory
construction
not
governed,
not
affected
by
treaty
or
any
agreement
between
the
countries?
