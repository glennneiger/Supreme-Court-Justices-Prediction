mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
quin
lumber
company
who
is
the
fourth
named
defendant
in
this
action
and
was
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
court.
the
question
of
law
that
was
presented
to
the
united
states
district
court
in
which
thereafter
was
presented
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
which
is
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
the
district
court
as
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
congress
enacting
sections
1331
and
1332
of
the
title
28
of
the
judicial
code
could
have
heard
this
case
on
the
merits
and
have
determined
liability
or
the
absence
of
liability
on
the
civil
or
law
side
of
the
court
where
the
plaintiff
insisted
on
staying
and
on
which
side
of
the
court
and
only
on
which
side
of
the
court,
he
has
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
now
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
pretrial
hearings
by
judge
sugarman
in
which
he
sought
the
jurisdictional
facts
as
to
whether
he
had
the
inherent
right
to
hear
this
case
on
the
law
side
of
the
court.
he
gave
two
plaintiffs'
counsel,
the
opportunity
to
have
the
whole
case,
transferred
to
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court
where
he
as
the
trier
of
the
facts
could
have
heard
the
case
without
the
jury.
the
plaintiff
through
counsel
refused
to
be
transferred
to
the
admiralty
side
where
he
had
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
therefore
judge
sugarman
dismissed
the
case
since
he
found
on
all
the
causes
of
action
which
had
been
set
forth
in
the
complaint
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
which
was
before
him.
and
this
question
of
humanitarian
quality
which
missed
a
point
he
raised
in
his
opening
argument
to
this
court
might
indicate
to
this
court
that
by
virtue
of
the
dismissal
and
the
affirmance
of
the
dismissal,
this
plaintiff
is
without
a
remedy
even
in
our
american
courts
and
i
think
that
is
a
disingenuous
argument
for
this
reason.
after
the
complaint
had
been
dismissed
or
after
the
affirmance
of
the
dismissal,
this
plaintiff
as
was
his
right,
instituted
an
action
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
in
new
york
county
suing
the
exact
four
defendants
that
he
has
here,
alleging
in
four
causes
of
action,
the
identical
facts
which
he
has
alleged
in
this
case,
so
that
at
this
point
of
the
proceeding
he
is
not
out
of
court,
as
far
as
the
american
courts
are
concerned,
but
that
doesn't
determine
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
judge
sugarman.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
my
client
was
negligent
in
that
we
did
something
on
board
the
vessel
that
contributed
to
the
injury
that
the
plaintiff
sustained
on
may
12,
1954.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
he
could
have
but
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
yes
he
could
have
your
honor
because
then
that
would
a
spanish
national
suing
an
american
citizen
and
then
under
the
diversity
citizenship
section
off
the
judicial
code,
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
think
so,
your
honor
under
this
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no,
i
think
under
your
honor's
pope
&
talbot
against
hawn
case
it
would
be
general
maritime
law,
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
he
had
sued
us
alone
standing
by
ourselves
in
the
federal
court.
now
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
well
i
think
he
is
suing
four
defendants
your
honor
in
connection
with
one
injury
and
he
says
as
against
due
defendant
a
jurisdiction
is
under
the
jones
act.
now
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
the
jones
act
then
there
remains
a
lawsuit
by
a
spanish
national
against
a
spanish
national
and
three
american
citizens
and
still
there
isn't
diversity
of
citizenship
to
commence
that
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
unless
your
honors
decide
in
this
case
if
you'll
reach
the
question
that
this
is
a
case
which
arises
under
the
constitution,
the
laws
and
the
treaties
of
the
united
states
so
that
the
jurisdiction
is
found
under
section
1331
and
you
don't
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i
don't
know
if
it's
coming
up
your
honor
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
there
is
a
conflict
now
between
the
first
circuit
on
one
side
and
the
second
and
third
circuit
on
another
side.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
it
has
been
urged
here
your
honor,
it's
urged
here
in
this
respect
that
if
your
honors
say
that
there
never
was
jurisdiction
under
the
jones
act
because
the
jurisdictional
facts
show
that
there
wasn't,
a
jones
act
suit
here,
then
you
must
get
to
the
next
question
and
the
next
question
is
nonetheless
could
you
have
brought
this
suit
as
a
spanish
alien
against
the
spanish
alien
and
three
american
citizens
in
the
federal
court
on
the
civil
side
because
this
being
a
maritime
tort,
a
maritime
tort
is
a
case
which
arises
under
the
constitution
and
then
the
third
question
is
if
there
was
no
good
lawsuit
to
begin
with
in
so
far
as
a
jones
act
suit
or
the
other
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
couldn't
be
pendent
jurisdiction
which
is
urged
here
because
pendent
jurisdiction
by
it's
very
nature
presupposes
a
good
jurisdiction
to
begin
with.
if
you
have
no
jones
act
jurisdiction
in
that,
he
never
could
have
asserted
it.
although
there
is
a
sham
allegation
all
the
jones
act
sued
against
this
defendant
and
if
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
under
the
lowest
constitutions
then
you
don't
have
pendent
jurisdiction
at
all.
and
i
think
that
roughly
is
the
position
that
i
took
in
the
courts
throughout
the
jones
act
suit
and
i
might
indicate
to
mr.
justice
whitaker
the
reason
that
judge
sugarman
went
into
the
question
on
management,
control
and
operation,
all
this
vessel
and
so
far
and
garcia
&
diaz
was
concerned
is
he
had
to
determine
since
the
plaintiff
in
the
first
cause
of
action
had
asserted
a
jones
act
suit
against
spanish
line
and
garcia
&
diaz,
he
had
to
determine
whether
conceivably
garcia
&
diaz
was
the
employer
of
this
particular
man
so
that
he
could
have
asserted
a
jones
act
suit
as
against
garcia
&
diaz
in
contrast
to
spanish
line.
he
found
that
under
the
facts
that
were
presented
to
him,
garcia
&
diaz
was
not
the
employer
of
the
plaintiff,
therefore
could
not
be
sued
under
the
jones
act
and
under
the
mcalister
case
which
he
cited
in
his
decision
which
this
court
handed
down
some
time
ago,
he
said
that
therefore
there
is
no
jones
act
suit
that
could
be
brought
against
garcia
&
diaz
and
that's
why
he
took
the
evidence
in
so
far
as
the
relationship
between
spanish
line
and
garcia
&
diaz
to
determine
whether
conceivably
garcia
&
diaz
was
the
employer
by
virtue
of
contractual
arrangements
or
as
approved
that
was
in
the
case.
i
respectfully
submit
having
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
this
plaintiff
had
to
sustain
it
and
he
didn't
sustain
it
by
virtue
of
the
facts
that
had
been
found
by
judge
sugarman
and
which
have
been
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
on
an
expression
on
the
workman
like
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
treaty
question
which
was
raised
in
second
circuit
has
been
disposed
off
in
that
plaintiff
withdrew
it.
so
that
there
is
represent
to
your
honors
report
questions
that
i
have
presented
in
my
brief
on
behalf
of
quin
lumber
co.
and
which
i
respectfully
submit
dictate
and
affirm
to
what
has
taken
place
here.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
that's
right
your
honor
undetermined,
pending
and
it's
being
withheld
in
abeyance
pending
disposition
of
your
honor's
decision
here,
because
manifestly
if
you
determine
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
began
with,
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
try
the
case
there
on
the
merits,
which
has
never
happened
in
this
case
despite
the
fact
that
the
petitioner's
brief
constantly
talks
about
this
action
being
tried
on
the
merits.
a
merits
preposition
would
result
in
either,
but
the
defendants
here
being
held
liable
for
damages
or
not
being
held
liable
for
damages
on
the
basis
of
the
(inaudible)
on
seaworthiness
or
negligence.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
no
the
plaintiff
hasn't
done
it
that
way
your
honor.
he
is
mainly
alleged
separate
courses
of
action
in
which
by
reference
he
incorporates
the
allegations
that
have
preceded
that
particular
cause
of
action.
so
that
when
you
see
this
amended
complaint
and
i
should
indicate
to
your
honor
it's
an
amended
complaint
in
that
he
brought
my
client
into
the
case
after
the
other
three
had
been
sued
and
that
is
something
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
for
this
reason.
in
order
to
try
this
action
–
it
was
originally
instituted
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey.
and
there
he
succeeded
in
getting
jurisdiction
over
the
persons
of
three
of
the
defendants
and
not
my
client,
because
my
client
didn't
do
business
in
new
jersey
and
therefore
could
not
be
sued
and
process
could
not
be
served
there.
he
then
came
over
here
to
new
york
and
he
sued
originally
the
three
defendants
in
that
he
had
two
companion
actions
going
on,
one
in
new
jersey
and
one
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
then
not
being
able
to
get
jurisdiction
over
my
client
in
new
jersey
he
served
an
amended
complaint
with
process
issuing
out
of
district
court
which
added
my
client
for
the
first
time
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
when
he
added
it,
he
alleged,
as
he
has
alleged
it
against
every
other
defendant
a
separate
cause
of
action,
but
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honor
he
has
a
cause
of
action
for
personal
injures
against
many
defendants,
but
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
have
been
set
for
as
separate
causes
of
action
but
that
doesn't
save
him.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
quin
lumber
in
this
case
who
was
one
of
the
respondents.
and
back
in
march
of
1958,
when
we
were
here
arguing
this
case
for
the
first
time,
we
attempted
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
narrow
scope
of
the
questions
that
were
being
presented
to
this
court
in
connection
with
the
romero
case.
we
indicated
at
that
time
that
the
sole
question
that
was
presented
in
this
matter,
although
it
had
several
facets,
was,
“did
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction
in
the
very
first
instance
to
hear
this
case
on
the
merits
which
would
have
meant
that
it
would
have
taken
proof
as
to
the
negligence
of
any
of
the
parties,
submitted
it
to
the
jury
if
there
were
questions
of
fact,
on
the
proper
charges
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
was
liability
or
whether
there
was
not
liability?”
the
district
court
did
not
do
that
at
all.
what
it
did
in
this
case
and
i
think
it's
a
little
disservice
to
the
district
judge
to
say
that
he
heard
this
case
on
the
merits
in
court,
is
the
district
court
when
confronted
with
motions
by
the
defendants
to
dismiss
this
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
inquired
into
the
subject
matter,
which
was,
“did
he
have
jurisdiction
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
had
been
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
insofar
as
two
of
the
defendants
were
concerned,
the
action
was
being
brought
against
them
under
the
jones
act
and
as
against
two
other
defendants,
it
was
being
brought
against
them
under
the
general
maritime
law?”
he,
if
the
question
had
not
been
raised
would
have
had
to
determine
for
himself,
whether
he
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
case
because
if
he
didn't
determine
it
sua
sponte
in
the
absence
of
any
motions
being
made,
we
would
have
possibly
been
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
question
would
have
been
raised
then.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
a
district
court
whose
jurisdiction
is
circumscribed
by
statute.
and
if
the
plaintiff
comes
within
the
statute,
then
he
can
have
a
case
triable
by
jury
on
the
civil
side
of
the
court
on
the
merits
which
would
have
determined
whether
any
or
all
of
the
defendants
whom
he
sued
had
been
negligent.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
romero
is
not
out
of
court,
although,
it
would
appear
from
the
arguments,
thus
far,
that
he
has
now
been
dismissed
of
any
action
triable
by
jury
and
he
is
relegated
to
going
back
to
spain
in
order
to
get
the
rights
that
are
accorded
him
under
the
contract
and
under
spanish
law.
after
this
action
had
been
dismissed
in
the
district
court,
and
when
the
case
was
on
its
way
up
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
mr.
romero
brought
the
third
action.
and
this
action
he
brought
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
this
action
he
brought
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
new
york
county
in
which
he
has
joined
the
four
defendants
in
which
his
complaint
is
identical
to
the
complaint
that
is
before
your
honor,
in
this
case.
in
fact,
previous
to
this
case
which
was
instituted
in
the
southern
district,
he
had
brought
an
action
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
but
since
he
can
--
could
not
get
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
my
client,
he
forwent
that
action
and
he
now
concentrated
on
his
action
in
the
southern
district.
now,
whether
judge
sugarman
in
dealing
with
garcia
and
diaz,
determined
some
question
of
fact
which
might
have
been
determined
on
a
full
trial,
i
respectfully
submit
to
your
honors,
as
unimportant
because
what
judge
sugarman
was
concerned
with
only,
and
as
i
think
primarily
was,
“did
he
have
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance
to
hear
this
case?”
now,
if
a
plaintiff,
a
foreign
spanish
national
can
sue
a
spanish
national
alleging
that
that
person
or
corporation
as
his
employer
and
he
has
rights
under
the
jones
act,
and
by
that
mere
allegation
clothe
the
district
court
with
jurisdiction,
then
what
is
happening
is
that
congress
hasn't
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
district
court.
the
plaintiff
by
his
allegation,
and
this
was
said
yesterday
by
mr.
puente,
has
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
district
court.
now,
i
say
and
i
say
it
respectfully
to
your
honor,
district
judge
sugarman
had
the
right
to
look
into
the
jurisdictional
facts
here
in
order
to
see
whether
this
man
came
within
the
compass
of
the
jones
act.
and
if
not,
whether
there
was
any
other
jurisdictional
ground
on
which
to
hold
this
case
and
let
it
be
tried
by
jury.
he
found
that
on
the
facts
that
were
adduced,
what
the
plaintiff
had
alleged
by
way
of
a
jones
act
action
against
garcia
and
diaz
and
spanish
line
were
sham
and
false.
that
this
man
--
the
only
contact
this
man
had
with
respect
to
a
possible
jones
act
suit
was
the
fact
that
the
action,
that
his
accident
had
happened
in
hoboken,
new
jersey
and
all
other
things
were
comparable
in
all
respects,
if
not
identical
to
the
lauritzen
case.
having
determined
that
he
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
jones
act,
he
gave
the
plaintiff
the
option
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
not
complete
diversity
of
citizenship
between
the
plaintiff
and
each
of
the
defendants
in
that.
the
plaintiff
was
a
spanish
national
and
one
of
the
defendants
was
a
spanish
national.
he
gave
him
the
option
to
go
to
the
admiralty
side
of
the
district
court
and
to
have
the
case
tried
on
its
merits
but
the
plaintiff
didn't
want
to
go
there
for
the
obvious
reason
that
that
case
would
have
been
triable
non-jury.
in
contrast
to
that
where
the
action
was
dismissed,
he
went
over
to
the
supreme
court
--
the
state
court
and
he
instituted
the
same
action
that
he
had
instituted
in
the
southern
district.
now,
mr.
justice
black
addressed
some
question
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
certainly.
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
there's
no
question
about
that,
your
honor,
because
that--
that
is
the
second
facet
of
this
jurisdictional
question.
if
your
honors
determine
that
this
action
is
properly
brought
under
the
jones
act,
and
that
gave
jurisdiction
to
the
district
judge
by
the
mere
allegation
that
the
action
was
brought
under
the
jones
act
to
hear
the
entire
case,
then
this
case
has
to
be
remanded,
to
be
tried
on
the
merits
in
the
district
court.
contrariwise,
if
your
honors
determine
that
this
case
is
not
properly
brought
as
against
spanish
line
under
the
jones
act,
the
next
question
that
is
presented
is,
“did
the
district
court
on
the
civil
law
side
where
an
action
is
triable
by
jury
and
where
a
jury
was
sought
by
the
plaintiff,
does
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction
under
1331
in
that
is
this
an
action
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states?”
and
i
respectfully
submit
under
the
authorities
which
i
set
forth
in
my
brief
and
under
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
writing
for
this
court
in
the
gully
case,
this
is
not
an
action
which
is
--
finds
its
roots
in
the
admiralty
law
in
that
it
gives
rights
to
this
man
--
mr.
sidney
a.
schwartz
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
thought
your
honor
had
written
it.
but
we
have
--
we
have
the
point
now
that
you
never
reach
the
second
question
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
in
that,
this
is
a
1331
case,
unless
you
determine
that
the
jones
act
suit
did
not
apply.
now,
insofar
as
whether
the
jones
act
suit
applies
or
not,
i
think
there
was
a
full
canvass
of
all
the
congressional
intent
and
all
the
material
available
in
the
lauritzen
case.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
and
on
the
basis
of
what's
presented
here,
which
is
nothing
new,
there
is
nothing
that's
been
presented
to
show
that
foreign
seamen
were
intended
to
be
embraced
by
the
congress
under
the
jones
act.
and
as
i've
set
forth
in
my
brief
at
page
7,
the
latest
treatise
in
admiralty,
which
i
think
is
an
excellent
work
written
by
professors
gilmore
and
black,
indicate
that
had
this
court
intended
to
determine
that
foreign
seamen
were
embraced
by
the
jones
act,
it
would
have
said
so
in
the
lauritzen
case
on
the
basis
of
the
congressional
history
there
presented.
thank
you.
