mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
argument
presentation
has
to
be
divided
between
mr.
axtell
and
myself
and
we
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
is
a
–
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
on
order
or
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
a
judgment
of
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
dismissed
the
plaintiff's
complaint
as
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
in
this
case
there
never
was
a
trial.
the
facts
were,
that
on
may
12,
1954,
the
spanish
ship,
s.
s.
guadalupe,
came
into
hoboken,
new
jersey
where
it
docked
and
francisco
romero,
a
spanish
citizen
and
crew
member
of
the
s.
s.
guadalupe,
and
employed
by
the
owners
of
the
s.
s.
guadalupe
who
are
the
compañía
transatlántica,
was
working
on
that
ship.
the
particular
facts
of
the
accident
will
be
more
deeply
gone
into
by
mr.
axtell.
what
happened
was
that
they
were
engaged,
that
is,
the
crew
members
were
engaged
in
topping
this
boom
which
is
merely
dropping
the
boom
to
bring
on
some
lumber
which
was
to
be
used
as
shipping
boards
to
store
grains.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
confusion
on
the
ship.
you
had
your
spanish
seamen
who
spoke
spanish.
you
had
your
longshoremen
who
spoke
english.
you
had
also
your
carpenters.
francisco
romero
was
feeding
this
wire
into
this
winch
when
the
wire
became
snarled
and
as
a
result,
his
leg
–
his
left
leg
was
amputated
and
his
right
leg
was
fractured.
he
was
rushed
by
ambulance
with
police
sirens
through
hoboken
to
st.
mary's
hospital.
there
he
was
at
the
point
of
death.
he
was
given
the
last
rites
and
however,
he
lived.
soon
after
the
accident,
an
action
was
started
against
the
owners
of
the
ship,
the
spanish
line,
compañía
transatlántica,
their
agents,
garcia
&
diaz,
and
longshoreman
international
terminal
operating
company
inc.,
and
some
time
much
later
the
carpenter
company
was
brought
into
the
case,
quin
lumber
company.
so
we
have
--
the
picture
was
there
were
three
american
corporations
that
is
international
terminal
operating,
the
garcia
&
diaz,
quin
lumber
company,
the
spanish
line
of
course
is
a
spanish
corporation.
the
complaint
was
composed
of
four
causes
of
action.
the
first
was
a
cause
of
action
against
both
the
spanish
line
and
garcia
&
diaz
under
the
jones
act.
and
the
second
cause
was
against
the
same
two
defendants
for
maintenance
and
cure
and
then
there
were
third
and
fourth
causes.
third
was
cause
of
action
against
international
terminal
operating
company's
negligence
and
also
the
same
cause
of
action
against
quin
lumber
company.
mr.
romero
stayed
in
the
hospital
a
long
time.
the
hospital
bill
mounted
up
to
$3,750.
payment
was
demanded
by
the
hospital
of
garcia
&
diaz,
the
agents
of
spanish
line.
the
payment
has
never
been
made.
garcia
&
diaz
has
stated
that
they
are
prepared
to
pay
only
up
to
july
10;
i
do
not
know
the
exact
date,
and
they
want
a
bill
for
that
date.
and
they
have
received
the
bill,
but
it
goes
i
believe
to
july
14,
just
few
days
more.
they
had
not
paid
for
that
bill.
the
spanish
seaman
received
an
artificial
limb
which
cost
$195
which
has
not
been
paid.
there
was
$25
bill
for
the
burial
of
the
amputated
part
in
the
catholic
cemetery
that
has
been
paid.
case
law
on
the
calendar,
we
requested
preferences
and
finally
we
did
come
to
that
point
where
the
case
was
marked
ready
for
trial.
we
appeared
before
judge
sugarman
who
was
to
be
the
sitting
judge
at
that
trial
with
a
jury
and
the
demand
for
a
jury
had
been
made.
on
that
morning
a
motion
was
made
by
the
defendants.
the
motion
was
to
dismiss
the
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
in
the
brief
of
the
spanish
line
they
have
stated
there
were
two
motions.
there
was
no
such
thing.
there
was
only
one
motion,
and
i
would
like
to
read
that
particular
page
in
the
transcript
which
appears
on
194(a)
where
the
court
says.
the
court;
the
court
can
proceed
under
the
rule
of
sua
sponte
in
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
in
any
event.
however,
so
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding.
i
am
presiding
on
the
basis
that
each
of
the
four
defendants
has
moved
orally
which
brought
on
this
pretrial
hearing
for
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint
upon
ground
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
mr.
quinlan;
that
is
right
and
yet
in
mr.
quinlan's
brief
he
stated
there
were
two
motions.
judge
sugarman
proceeded
to
try
to
obtain
a
stipulation
as
to
the
facts.
as
he
went
along
they
got
the
citizenship
of
mr.
romero,
spanish
citizen,
the
spanish
line
and
the
other
defendants.
but
there
came
a
point
where
the
question
of
the
management
of
the
ship,
the
management
and
operation
came
up.
it
was
conceded
that
the
spanish
line
ownership,
but
the
plaintiffs
contended
that
as
far
as
management
and
operation
it
was
a
joint
affair
between
the
agents
and
the
owner
of
the
ship,
garcia
&
diaz
and
the
spanish
line.
on
that
point
the
judge
took
evidence.
he
had
the
deposition
which
had
been
taken
out
of
the
secretary
to
garcia
&
diaz
and
he
also
received
a
contract
between
garcia
&
diaz
and
--
the
agency
contract
between
garcia
&
diaz
and
i
believe
a
cuban
branch
of
garcia
and
diaz
and
the
spanish
line.
then
we
continued
on
with
the
stipulation
and
the
court
came
to
the
contract.
the
seamen
had
signed
a
contract.
on
top
of
that
contract
it
said,
roundtrip
voyage
starts
as
bilbao
goes
through
new
york,
i
think
down
to
mexico
and
ends
when
it
gets
back
to
bilbao.
it
was
on
the
second
trip
--
there
was
the
roundtrip
and
then
he
went
out
two
trips
more
and
on
that
second
one
was
when
this
injury
occurred.
there
no
written
extension
of
that
contract.
the
judge
took
evidence
on
the
point
of
whether
the
contract
could
be
extended
under
the
law
and
at
that
point,
mr.
quinlan
called
one
of
the
lawyers
who
i
believe
is
with
the
spanish
workmen's
compensation
administration
in
spain,
and
the
plaintiff
called
an
expert
on
that
point.
meanwhile,
there
had
been
repeated
motions
that
the
judge
had
no
right
to
entertain
–
to
hold
this
pretrial
hearing.
the
judge
apparently
was
a
little
--
he
wondered
about
it,
because
in
the
transcript
you
will
see
that
he
asked
several
of
the
counsel
if
they
had
ever
seen
any
or
heard
of
any
other
procedure
of
this
type
for
this
kind
of
the
thing
and
they
said,
no.
then
the
motion
was
made.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
our
objection
is
this
that
the
plaintiff
had
pleaded
the
general
maritime
law
and
the
jones
act
and
upon
his
pleading
that
and
providing
it
was
not
sham,
the
court
had
jurisdiction
providing
there
had
been
no
objection
to
a
general
appearance.
i
mean,
if
the
defendants
had
put
in
a
special
appearance
on
that
they
appeared
general,
but
once
it
got
to
that
point,
we
had,
so
to
speak,
given
the
magic
word,
we
pleaded
the
jones
act
and
the
general
maritime
law
and
we
were
qualified
to
have
a
trial.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
as
a
jurisdiction,
no,
because
in
the
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
what?
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
it
has
to
go
to
trial
and
the
fair
v.
kohler
decision
has
pointed
out
that
the
plaintiff
is
the
master
of
his
complaint
and
that
the
questions
of
merit
must
be
decided
as
such
and
you
cannot
change
questions
of
merit
into
jurisdictional.
once
this
party
had
got
past
the
general
appearance
stage
and
no
defendant
objected;
they
appeared
and
we
have
pleaded
the
jones
act
and
we
have
pleaded
the
general
maritime
law
and
it
was
no
sham,
we
had
a
right
to
a
trial
and
no
judge
could
--
commence
a
pretrial
hearing
and
start
considering
matters
such
as
the
whether
a
contract
was
extended
which
was
a
merit
question,
such
as
the
custom
and
usage,
which
was
also
a
custom
and
usage
as
to
whether
this
seamen
signed
contracts
transparently
and
also,
as
to
the
question
of
law,
as
to
the
workmen's
compensation
law.
there
are
many
of
these
questions
which
were
questions
of
merit
and
the
judge
labeled
them
jurisdictionally.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
no,
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
said
that.
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
said
that
because
under
fair
v.
kohler
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
jurisdiction
in
short
means,
your
honor
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
i
regard
that
once
that
a
plaintiff
who
is
the
master
of
his
compliant
has
stated
that
it
is
a
jones
act
and
general
maritime
law
and
providing
there
has
been
a
general
appearance
and
there
was
no
sham,
this
man
was
a
seaman.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
of
complaint.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
what
we
are
maintaining
is
that
the
moment
a
plaintiff
states
a
cause
of
action,
and
it
is
sham,
and
here
he
stated
it
was
based
on
the
jones
act
and
general
maritime
law,
he
qualified.
no
judge
at
that
point,
trial
judge
could
question
the
jurisdiction,
and
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
alright.
then
there
is
the
second
--
there
is
another
point
on
this
question,
not
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
but
there
is
a
section
55
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
which
states
in
effect
that
an
employee
may
not
waive
his
right.
in
other
words,
that
section
would
try
to
block
off
employers
who
will
prepare
contracts
to
obtain
releases
so
that
they
lose
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
the
contract,
the
seaman's
contract
in
this
case
which
is
signed
for
roundtrip
contained
such
a
clause
that
if
there
was
any
accident,
the
accident
would
be
litigated
pursuant
to
the
spanish
laws
and
no
others.
our
claim
--
our
contention
is
that
such
a
clause
is
in
effect
a
violation
of
section
55
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
the
moment
that
ship
comes
into
united
states
waters
and
there
is
an
accident
that
seaman
pleads,
files
a
complaint
under
the
jones
act,
and
under
the
general
maritime
law,
at
that
point,
we
contend
that;
that
clause
and
that
spanish
contract
is
in
violation
of
the
federal
employees
liability
act.
we
do
not
contend
that;
that
clause
is
violation
of
the
federal
employee
liability
act
if
the
accident
occurs
over
in
spain
or
if
it
occurs
over
in
japan.
we
say
that
once
he
comes
into
united
states
waters,
and
there
is
this
accident
and
he
has
got
his
lawsuit,
we
maintain
that
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
if
there
is
no
sham
in
the
pleading
of
that
jones
act.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
well.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
no,
a
sham
might
be
a
person
who
is
not
a
seaman
and
says
i
am
suing
under
the
jones
act
and
clearly
he
is
not
a
seaman.
now
i
think
that
this
point
is
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
yes.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
that
is
right.
if
for
instance,
service
had
not
been
proper
and
they
came
in
specially
and
move
to
have
--
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
yes.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
i
do
not
know,
but
the
lauritzen-larsen
case,
which
mr.
axtell
will
discuss
more,
in
that
case
it
states
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
jones
act
is
shortly
answered.
in
that
case
the
injury
occurred
in
the
havana
waters.
and
it
did
not
occur
in
united
states
waters
and
still
they
pleaded
the
jones
acts
and
the
court
did
set
aside
on
jurisdiction,
not
this
court.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
now
i
just
want
to
take
one
last
point
and
i
would
like
mr.
axtell
to
take
over.
when
this
accident
occurred
in
hoboken
there
has
been
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
tranquility
of
the
port.
we
maintain
that;
that
tranquility
was
disturbed
with
your
ambulance
going
down
there,
with
the
police
going
down
there,
and
bringing
him
back
to
the
hospital.
we
maintain
that;
that
tranquility
was
disturbed.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
i
would
say
this
to
your
honor
that
there
was
the
case
of
cunard
lines
against
miller
which
involved
the
prohibition
law
where
foreign
ships
came
into
united
status
ports
with
sealed,
stored
liquors,
and
the
court
held
that
such
foreign
ships
could
not
come
in
with
those
liquors,
because
of
prohibition
law,
and
so
decided.
i
do
not
see
where
it
was
disturbance
of
the
tranquility
of
the
port
in
that
case.
whereas
here
we
have
a
person
who
is
injured,
who
lost
is
leg,
who
is
taken
by
an
ambulance
back
to
the
hospital
where
a
hospital
bill
has
not
be
paid,
where
there
was
this
confusion
on
the
ship,
where
the
stevedores
who
ordinary
top
these
booms
and
instead
the
spanish
line
used
the
crew
to
do
that
operation.
but
my
last
point,
and
i
want
to
finish
up
is
that
i
would
i
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
sieracki
case
the
court
stated
that
the
great
humanitarian
quality
about,
well,
in
that
case
it
involved
a
longshoreman
who
sued
under
seaworthiness
and
the
court
maintained
that
people
in
such
hazardous
occupations,
the
law
protected
them
and
it
would
be
humanitarian
about
them.
now
here
we
have
a
case
where
we
have
pleaded
on
seaworthiness
where
we
have
seaman
and
we
have
the
jones
act
which
is
to
help
seaman
and
are
we
to
cut
off
an
individual
who
come
into
hoboken
on
his
ship
and
he
suffers
this
injury,
are
we
going
to
cut
off
these
humanitarian
benefits
from
him?
thank
you.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
your
honor
this
case
has
been
a
very
hard
fought
case,
not
only
on
the
facts.
a
statement
was
made
here
by
mr.
quinlan
that
he
has
been
furnished
with
maintenance
and
cure,
mr.
remero
hasn't
a
received
a
nickel.
the
statement
was
also
made
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
go
up
to
spanish
consulate
and
get
in
workman's
compensation.
there
is
a
letter
which
has
been
filed
here
which
my
client
received
in
which
he
is
told
by
the
spanish
line
that
all
they
need
is
a
doctor's
report
and
he
will
get
his
workman's
compensation.
it's
a
fact
that
the
captain
and
the
surgeon
of
this
ship
went
to
the
hospital
at
st.
mary's
had
attempted
to
get
him
out
of
the
hospital.
they
tell
us
to
save
themselves
from
a
fine,
that's
what
they
tell
us.
but
their
background
is,
if
you
get
them
in,
in
fact
to
stay,
he
never
comes
back
here
to
sue
and
the
case
is
finished.
that
technique
has
been
used
by
other
steamship
companies;
they
get
these
people
out
of
the
country
and
quick.
then
the
last
point,
they
speak
about
the
hospital
here.
it
has
not
been
paid,
we
all
know
that.
now
the
question
has
been
made
that
--
a
point
has
been
made
about
the
contract
that
it
was
signed
individually.
this
contract
was
not
signed
individually
for
this
trip;
there
was
no
contract
for
this
trip.
there
was
a
round
trip
contract
two
voyages
before
this
accident
and
a
contract
said
right
on
top
round
trip
contract,
when
he
gets
back
to
bilbao,
finished
and
he
came
over
to
more
trips.
yet,
we're
led
to
believe
that
he
signed
a
contract
in
bilbao
when
he
took
this
trip.
now
as
to
the
larsen
case,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
this
very
important
language
where
the
court
said
at
page
1224,
we
do
not
think
the
place
of
contract
is
substantial
influence
in
the
choice
between
competing
laws
to
govern
a
maritime
tort.
since
the
accident
in
the
larsen
case
occurred
in
the
port
of
havana,
cuba
we
conclude
that
the
accident
in
the
case
at
bar
having
occurred
in
the
territory
of
united
states,
the
rule
of
lex
loci
delicti
commissi
will
govern
for
the
court,
said
in
the
larsen
case
and
this
is
very
important
in
last
quotation.
on
1291,
place
of
the
wrongful
act,
the
solution
most
commonly
accepted
as
to
torts
in
our
municipal
and
in
international
law
is
to
apply
to
law
of
the
place,
with
the
act
giving
right
to
the
liability
occur,
the
lex
loci
delicti
commissi.
this
rule
of
locality
often
applied
to
maritime
torts
would
indicate
application
of
law
of
cuba,
the
accident
happened
in
cuba
and
whose
domain
the
accident
took
the
place.
in
our
case
the
accident
happened
in
the
hoboken,
new
jersey,
the
united
states
waters.
and
then
the
last
point
we
have
had
here
i
think
a
little
presentation
here
on
what
the
jones
act
is.
the
seamen's
act
was
passed
in
1915.
as
mr.
quinlan
stated
that
was
--
law
was
written
to
promote
and
help
american
seamen,
but
the
jones
act
which
was
in
1920,
which
was
a
separate
act
and
where
the
provision
section
33
appears,
which
amends
section
20
which
was
knocked
down
by
the
(inaudible)
decision,
that
section
20
--
section
33
exist
both
in
the
jones
act
and
it
also
exists
in
the
seamen's
act,
it
has
a
dual
existence.
and
in
the
jones
act
we
have
a
different
legislative
intent
and
i'm
reading
now
from
page
61
of
the
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merits,
which
reads
from
the
policy
--
from
the
policy
of
the
jones
act.
i'm
reading
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
it
is
hereby
declared
to
be
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
do
whatever
may
be
necessary
to
develop
and
encourage
the
maintenance
of
such
a
merchant
marine.
and
then
you'll
find
here
in
this
brief
a
discussion
of
the
legislative
committee
hearings,
where
they
wanted
to
equalize
the
course
of
the
american
merchant
marine,
they
want
to
save
the
american
merchant
marine.
and
yet
today
by
the
action
of
the
spanish
line
in
not
paying
its
hospitals
bill,
and
not
sending
any
money
to
the
seamen,
not
offering
an
artificial
limb,
just
say
come
back
to
the
spain
or
go
to
your
spanish
counsel,
we
won't
do
anything.
the
spanish
line
is
saving
money.
not
only
that
they've
got
to
appoint
where
on
st.
mary's
hospital
they
say
fine
the
man
stay
there
till
january,
beside
we're
going
to
pay
till
july
14th.
who
has
to
pay
for
the
balance?
saint
mary's
hospital
and
they're
the
ones
who
are
going
to
suffer,
not
the
steamship
company.
so
these
foreign
steamship
companies
are
taking
advantage
and
thus
our
merchant
marine
today
is
going
down
further
and
further
and
i
just
want
to
make
one
last
statement.
in
the
new
york
law
journal
there
appeared
a
decision,
just
recently
dealing
with
the
taxi
cabs.
apparently
they
are
now
using
a
device
in
new
york,
where
a
man
will
have
a
150
taxi
cabs
and
he
puts
two
cabs
to
each
corporation
that
way
he
limits
his
liability
on
two
cabs
to
each
cooperation.
there's
been
a
great
healing
try
because
the
taxi
cabs
companies
only
have
5,000
to
10,000
liabilities,
whereas
the
individual
had
10,000
to
20,000.
they
are
going
to
do
something
about
it,
but
yet
we
have
today,
where
many
steamship
companies
have
one
ship
or
one
co-operation,
nobody
has
done
anything
about
it.
it's
the
old
story
of
the
public
being
aroused
and
may
be
this
case
can
solve
this
whole
dilemma.
thank
you.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
court,
we
would
like
to
allot
our
time.
i
intend
to
take
30
minutes
and
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
to
take
20
minutes
and
we
wish
to
reserve
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
narciso
puente,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
this
case
is
francisco
romero.
this
case
was
argued
before
this
court
on
march
13th,
1958
and
on
may
19th,
1958.
this
court
ordered
it
to
be
reargued
without
any
decision
on
open
points.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
a
--
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
affirming
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
the
facts
on
the
case
were
these.
on
may
12,
1954,
a
spanish
vessel
by
the
name
of
guadalupe
was
in
hoboken,
new
jersey,
tied
up
at
a
pier,
and
mr.
francisco
romero,
a
spanish
seaman
was
employed
as
a
crew
member
aboard
that
ship.
while
he
was
performing
his
duty
and
those
duties
consisted
of
topping
the
boom
which
incidentally
had
been
done
previously
by
longshoremen
in
that
--
on
that
ship
at
that
pier,
but
this
time
the
general
agent
garcia
had
the
--
had
made
its
agreement
with
the
longshoremen
but
the
crew
members
were
topping
the
boom.
and
in
doing
that
operation,
and
we
claim
because
of
the
negligence
of
all
the
parties,
mr.
romero's
leg
was
cut
off
and
the
other
one
was
broken.
he
was
rushed
to
the
st.
mary's
hospital
in
hoboken,
rushed
by
an
ambulance
with
screaming
sirens
and
there
he
was
treated.
he
was
close
to
death
but
fortunately,
he
was
able
to
recover.
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
eight
months
and
the
hospital
bill
for
st.
mary's
in
hoboken,
the
hospital
bill
is
still
unpaid
which
is
the
sum
of
$3750.
there
is
also
a
bill
for
an
artificial
limb
of
$195
which
is
not
paid
and
a
burial
bill
of
the
separate
leg
of
$25
which
is
unpaid.
the
plaintiff
has
not
received
the
penny
in
compensatory
damages,
compensation
of
maintenance
and
cure
and
unpaid
wages
at
the
end
of
the
voyage.
a
lawsuit
was
instituted
and
it
was
instituted
by
a
complaint
on
the
law
side
of
the
district
court
and
the
parties
were
the
seaman
francisco
romero,
a
spanish
seaman
and
a
spanish
subject;
compania
transatlantica,
the
employer
and
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
a
spanish
corporation,
the
general
agent
of
the
spanish
line,
garcia
and
diaz,
which
is
an
american
corporation,
also
the
international
terminal
operating
company,
which
is
the
company
which
hired
longshoremen
and
is
an
american
corporation
and
finally,
quin
lumber
company,
which
had
–
whose
employees
were
the
carpenters,
who
have
been
hired
to
put
the
shifting
boards
on
the
vessel,
which
is
also
an
american
corporation.
the
causes
of
action;
there
were
--
against
the
spanish
line
and
the
agent,
there's
a
cause
of
action
on
the
jones
act,
the
general
maritime
law,
also
a
claim
for
maintenance
and
cure
and
unpaid
wages
on
the
end
of
voyage
under
the
maritime
law.
this
was
brought
under
--
claimed
on
this
section
1331
in
addition
to
pendent
jurisdiction.
against
the
american
corporations,
there
was
claim
made
under
general
maritime
law
under
section
1331
and
diversity
of
citizenship
under
section
1332.
issue
was
joined,
and
there
was
lengthy
and
long
pretrial
procedure.
francisco
romero
was
examined,
deposition
was
taken
off
him
twice.
photographs
were
taken
of
the
vessel.
discovery
and
the
inspection
proceedings
were
held
on
the
cable,
which
sheared
off
his
leg.
in
addition,
they
were
written
interrogatories
of
the
offices
of
the
spanish
line
in
madrid.
in
addition,
we
examined
the
officers
of
garcia
and
diaz
and
office
of
garcia
and
diaz
and
also
an
officer
of
quin
lumber
company.
a
preference
was
granted.
the
case
was
marked
ready
for
trial.
it
was
assigned
to
trial
court,
a
trial
before
jury
for
judge
sugarman.
at
that
time,
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
was
made.
after
a
two-day
pretrial
hearing
before
judge
sugarman,
judge
sugarman
granted
that
motion
against
all
the
defendants.
his
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
seaman
filed
a
petition
of
certiorari
before
this
court
and
was
granted.
now,
there
is
difficulty
of
presentation
in
this
appeal
because
of
judge
sugarman's
failure
to
correctly
separate
what
we
call
questions
of
jurisdiction
and
questions
of
merit.
if
he
had,
he
would
have
summarily
decided
only
the
questions
of
jurisdiction
and
this
court
would
have
had
only
before
three
questions;
whether
jones
act,
the
american
maritime
law
covers
this
seaman,
jurisdiction
of
law
under
section
1331
based
on
general
maritime
law
and
the
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction.
judge
sugarman
overruled
our
objections
to
this
proceeding.
he
denied
our
motion
to
strike.
he
went
ahead
and
made
findings
and
after
making
findings,
he
turned
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
he
took
facts
on
questions,
what
we
think
of
merit
other
than
questions
of
diversity,
which
he
would
had
a
right
to
consider.
he
held
that
the
seaman
could
not
sue
under
the
jones
act
under
pollock
and
paduano
case
and
he
dismissed
the
general
maritime
claims
on
the
authority
of
the
paduano
and
troop
case
over
those
no
federal
question.
he
held
there
was
no
complete
diversity
of
citizenship
between
all
parties
and
the
client's
jurisdiction
--
discretionary
admiralty
jurisdiction.
there
were
10
questions
we
raised
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
what
we
have
attempted
to
do
is
to
spread
them
into
three
broad
questions.
the
first
one
concerns
the
jurisdiction
under
section
1331
and
section
1332.
under
the
section
1331,
there
are
three
types.
the
first
type
is
where
a
claim
is
asserted
under
the
jones
act.
we
maintain
at
the
moment
that
a
claim
is
asserted
under
the
state
--
federal
statute,
which
is
here
in
the
jones
act
and
in
view
of
the
larson
case
we
maintain
that
once
that
assertion
is
made
the
court
--
jurisdiction
has
been
conferred
on
the
court.
and
then
the
court
can
go
in
to
the
consideration
of
deciding
whether
the
jones
act
covers
a
foreign
seaman
injured
on
a
foreign
ship
while
the
foreign
ship
was
in
united
states
waters,
a
question
which
i
had
been
reserved
in
the
flour
mills
versus
(inaudible)
case
and
this
question
we
want
answered.
two,
under
section
1331
is
another
type
--
the
type
is
that
there
is
pendent
jurisdiction
against
the
employer,
the
maritime
claims
weren't
related
to
the
jones
act.
and
three,
one
of
the
most
important
questions
in
this
case
is,
that
where
a
claim
is
made
under
the
general
maritime
law
under
section
1331,
we
claim
that
there
is
jurisdiction
and
the
court
will
sustain
it.
there
had
been
a
conflict
on
this
point.
the
first
district
--
the
first
circuit
under
the
doucette
and
the
jansson
versus
swedish
american
lines
has
held
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
where
a
claim
is
made
under
the
general
maritime
law
under
section
1331.
however,
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
the
third
circuit,
the
courts
have
held
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
will
not
sustain
it
and
there,
in
the
paduano
case
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
the
jordine
case
in
the
third
circuit,
these
propositions
were
held.
this
is
the
conflict
and
this
is
the
question
to
also
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
and
on
march
3rd,
1875
an
act
was
passed
wherein
the
district
courts
were
given
the
same
jurisdiction
on
cases
arriving
under
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
as
--
it
was
had
by
the
appellate
courts.
and
senator
--
senator
carpenter,
who
was
the
sponsored
of
this
law,
stated
that
it
was
intended
to
confer
precisely
the
powers
which
the
constitution
provided
for.
he
said,
this
bill
gives
precisely
the
power
which
the
constitution
confers.
nothing
more,
nothing
less
after
noting
that
in
the
act
of
1789
did
not
confer
the
whole
power
which
the
constitution
conferred.
in
other
words,
the
act
1875
gave
the
district
courts
the
same
jurisdiction
as
the
appellate
courts
had
where
a
case
had
arisen
under
the
laws
and
constitution
of
united
states.
so
as
this
court
has
held
that
maritime
law
is
part
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
their
holding
is
on,
you'll
see
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
the
knickerbocker
versus
stewart
case
and
paduano
which
--
since
this
court
has
held
that
the
maritime
law
is
part
of
the
laws
of
united
states,
which
federal
state
lower
courts
must
enforce
and
since
their
decision
will
be
reviewed
by
this
court
to
ensure
uniform
enforcement
of
maritime
law
such
an
action
is
one
where
in
the
matter
in
controversy
is
required
by
section
1331
arises
on
the
constitution
laws
of
the
united
states.
therefore,
we
maintain
that
the
maritime
law
of
united
states
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
much
a
part
of
the
laws
of
united
states
as
any
congressional
enactment.
then
we
come
to
the
erie
versus
tompkins
where
the
court
--
this
court
held
that,
in
section
--
that
was
in
section
1652
laws
of
the
federal
states
not
only
it
includes
the
states
statutes
but
also
includes
decisions
of
law.
and
we
claim
that
there's
analogy
here
which
is
strongly
stated
in
warren
versus
united
states
and
in
the
garrett
versus
moore-mccormack
and
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn.
the
paduano
and
jordine
case
in
our
opinion
made
an
error
in
the
sense
that,
when
it
cited
the
american
insurance
--
insurance
company
versus
canter,
which
was
a
decision
by
judge
marshall,
they
have
cited
the
remarks
by
judge
marshall
in
which
he
stated
that
there
was
established
cases
based
on
maritime
law
as
constitutionally
the
state
in
the
class
of
cases
which
the
case
of
law
arising
on
the
constitutional
laws
of
united
states.
now,
the
error
is
one
in
the
definition
of
the
word
cases.
if
the
judges
in
the
paduano
and
the
jordine
case
had
looked
to
the
osborne
versus
u.s.
bank
case,
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court
four
years
earlier
to
the
american
insurance
case
and
the
opinions
written
by
the
same
justice,
mr.
chief
justice
marshall,
they
want
to
know
that
definition
of
the
word
cases
and
know
that
that
is
a
definition
of
cases
meant
that
the
word
cases
means
when
it
has
assumed
a
force
that
the
judicial
power
is
capable
acting
on
it.
the
power
comes
into
action
when
the
party
asserts
his
rights
in
the
form
prescribed
by
laws,
that
is
the
case,
all
cases
must
be
formalized.
in
other
words,
you
can
have
a
case,
which
is
rooted
in
the
maritime
law
but
formalized
as
a
case
at
law
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
united
states.
we
have
an
example
of
this,
it's
in
the
top
of
font
case
where
there,
we
had
a
case
which
is
rooted
in
maritime
law
and
it
was
formalized
as
the
case
at
work.
and
in
there,
there
was
also
diverse
--
in
other
words,
the
case
formalize
as
case
of
law
can
be
rooted
in
maritime
law
and
arise
under
the
constitution.
a
case
formalized
as
a
case
in
admiralty
and
maritime
can
be
rooted
in
state
law
and
the
other
section
1331.
therefore,
we
claim
that
the
questions
one
of
how
our
cases
formalized.
it
is
in
just
same
cases
--
cases
of
admiralty
--
of
admiralty
in
maritime
law
but
how
that
case
was
formalized
and
the
same
way
here.
we
have
formalized
this
case,
a
case
of
law.
we
claim,
make
a
claim
under
the
general
maritime
law
arising
under
the
laws
of
united
states
and
the
--
the
general
maritime
law
is
part
of
laws
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
final
--
final
part
of
this
first
class
is
under
section
1332
where
the
court
failed
to
sustain
diversity.
the
court
here
has
failed
to
note
that
the
matter
in
controversy
between
the
seamen
and
the
spanish
line
is
different
from
the
matter
in
controversy
between
seamen
and
the
quin
lumber
company
and
international
terminal
operating
company.
diversity
exists
as
to
the
american
companies
and
as
to
the
spanish
line
there
was
the
jones
act
and
pendent
jurisdiction.
now,
i
come
to
the
second
part,
this
is
three
parts
i'm
trying
to
explain,
the
second
part
which
is
the
erroneous
procedure
and
erroneous
rulings
made
below.
the
court
has
only
one
motion
before
it
and
that
motion
was
that
the
court
should
dismiss
because
there
was
--
it
lacked
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
we
maintain
that
once
the
stipulation
of
facts
had
been
reached
at
that
point
judge
sugarman
should
decide
it
and
not
taken
any
facts.
if
--
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
from
the
case
of
mayor
versus
cooper
to
just
one
sentence
which
appears
at
73
u.s.
247,
there
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
course
is
made
and
there
the
court
said
at
250,
“if
there
were
no
jurisdiction,
there
was
no
power
to
do
anything
but
to
strike
the
case
from
the
docket.”
we
--
we
made
repeated
objections
and
we
made
motion
to
strike
which
were
denied.
the
court
--
the
district
court
made
a
mistake
that
it
could
take
--
it
could
make
findings
once
a
law
had
been
asserted.
the
court
could
not
test
that
question
by
making
funds.
however,
if
it
had
been
just
purely
case
where
only
diversity
was
involved
then
it
could
make
findings.
but
once
the
law
was
asserted,
jurisdiction
was
conferred
upon
the
court
since
the
case
was
one
have
a
plan
arising
under
the
law,
federal
law
which
we
asserted.
the
court
makes
the
questions
of
merits
and
the
questions
of
fact.
the
court
could
not
make
findings
and
then
consider
question
jurisdiction.
it
just
couldn't
do
it
because
my
opinion
as
judge
sugarman
made
this
mistake
in
the
application
of
this
test.
if
the
law
is
asserted
then
jurisdiction
is
conferred.
he
can't
let
--
take
findings
on
that
question,
but
if
the
case
had
been
one
simply
where
the
only
proposition
was
diversity
of
citizenship,
he
could
in
that
case
have
a
right
to
question
what
the
citizenship
of
the
various
parties
were.
but
once
the
law
was
asserted,
he
could
not
use
the
same
test
which
you
used
to
test
the
question
of
diversity.
he
also
made
findings
on
--
on
the
contract,
the
seaman's
contract.
now,
there
we
have
a
sort
of
contradictory
procedure
because
we
have
section
5
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
which
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
--
on
page
38;
which
states,
at
the
top,
any
contract
rule,
regulation
or
device
whatsoever
the
purpose
of
intent
which
shall
be
to
enable
any
common
carrier
to
exempt
itself
from
any
liability
created
by
this
chapter
shall,
to
that
extent,
be
void.
this
section
was
incorporated
as
well
as
the
federal
employers
liability
act
in
the
jones
act.
now,
this
contract
was
clearly
one
of
attempting
to
void
the
responsibility
under
this
act.
however,
before
judge
sugarman
could
reach
a
decision
as
to
whether
this
contract
voided
he
had
to
decide
whether
the
jones
act
applied
because
--
and
the
only
way
he
could
make
that
decision
is
by
taking
facts
and
considering
questions
of
merit.
that
would
have
been
an
admission
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction.
now
the
moment
he
started
taking
questions
of
merit,
then,
he
could
decide
if
the
jones
act
applied.
if
he
decided
the
jones
act
did
not
apply,
then
he
could
go
ahead
and
decide
what
he
wished
on
this
contract.
but
the
moment
he
decided
the
jones
act
applied
and
section
5
will
come
in
to
play
and
this
spanish
seamen's
contract
would
be
nullified.
now,
the
third
and
final
question
here
covers
errors
in
construction
of
the
jones
act,
federal
employers
liability
act,
general
maritime
law
and
public
policy
of
the
nation.
the
worst
error
here
was
that
judge
sugarman
in
construing
the
jones
act
stated
that
the
seaman
could
not
sue.
we
have
tried
--
we've
taken
trouble
to
take
section
33
for
the
jones
act
and
to
break
it
down.
the
first
part
of
that
--
the
section
33
can
be
divided
into
two
parts.
one
part
is
an
extension
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
to
cover
seamen,
that's
clearly
spelled
out.
and
the
second
is,
what
we
get
to
call
permissive
adjective
procedure,
which
is
that
any
seamen
institute
an
action
and
obtain
a
trial
by
jury
at
his
election.
it's
interesting
enough
that
the
strathearn-dillon
case
which
judge
sutton
of
this
court,
at
that
time
practicing
lawyer
prepared,
prepared
the
brief
in
the
strathearn-dillon
case
and
later
was
very
important
in
the
preparation
of
section
33
of
the
jones
act.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
strathearn-dillon
case
was
decided
37
days
before
section
33
was
proposed.
you
will
recall
that
in
that
case,
it
had
to
do
with
claims
for
wages.
under
section
4530
of
the
revised
statutes,
every
seamen
in
united
states
vessel
had
same
rights.
this
was
later
amended
to
include
foreign
vessels
--
seamen
on
foreign
vessels
and
that
was
later
interpreted
to
include
foreign
seamen
on
foreign
vessels.
the
--
in
the
strathearn-dillon,
they
pointed
out
that
seaman
had
--
american
seaman
had
the
right
even
before
section
33.
they
pointed
out
that
it
had
a
right
to
go
into
court
by
its
action.
section
33,
particularly
the
section
dealing
with
the
permissiveness
instituting
action
(inaudible)
the
courts
was
for
foreign
seamen.
so
we
claim
that
the
jones
act
covers
foreign
seamen.
in
strathearn-dillon,
it
was
said
no
such
provision
was
necessary
as
to
american
seamen
for
they
had
the
right
independently
of
the
statute
to
seek
readdress
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
and
if
it
were
the
intentions
of
congress
to
limit
the
provision
of
the
act
to
american
seamen,
this
feature
would
have
been
wholly
superfluous.
it's
interesting
when
you
read
the
congressional
record
which
mr.
axtell
will
refer
to
how
in
the
section
33
--
33
came
up
was
immediately
passed
and
just
prior
to
that,
they
have
been
discussing
this
very
same
question.
and
finally
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
court
rejected
the
lien
argument
and
the
venue
argument
in
(inaudible).
i
think
the
--
my
presentation
would
be
incomplete
without
a
reference
to
a
case
which
i
think
is
extremely
important
which
is
o'connor
versus
miller
case
which
involved
the
prohibition
act.
it
seems
that
in
those
days,
a
ship
would
come
in
with
–
a
foreign
ship
would
come
in
with
some
liquor
in
its
sealed
lockers
and
they
therefore
apply
that
law
to
prohibit
foreign
ships
from
coming
in
with
liquor
in
their
sealed
lockers.
and
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
court
is
very
applicable
probably
hear
many
expressions
about
laws
of
the
flag.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
used
these
--
these
very
words
in
support
of
their
contention,
the
defendants
refer
to
the
statement
sometimes
made
that
a
merchant
ship
is
a
part
of
the
territory
of
the
country
whose
flag
she
flies.
but
this,
as
has
been
aptly
observed,
is
a
figure
of
speech,
a
metaphor
citing
scharrenberg
against
dollar
245
u.s.,
122,
127.
and
finally
i'd
like
to
read
this
one
last
sentence
from
a
same
case,
“a
merchant
ship
of
one
country
voluntarily
entering
the
territorial
limits
of
another,
subjects
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
latter.
the
jurisdiction
attaches
by
virtue
of
her
presence,
just
as
with
other
objects
within
those
limits.
during
her
stay,
she
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
laws
of
that
place
and
correlatively
is
bound
to
yield
obedience
to
them.
of
course,
the
local
sovereign
may
not
--
may
out
of
consideration
of
public
policy
choose
to
forego
to
exert
its
jurisdiction.”
you
may
also
hear
today
about
the
tranquility
report.
as
far
as
that
argument
is
concerned,
there
was
a
--
an
ambulance
racing
through
the
streets
of
hoboken.
there
was
the
port
of
authority
making
a
report
on
the
action.
there
was
a
policeman,
who
kept
calling
me
up,
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
the
severed
leg
who
eventually
was
buried?
all
these
matters
with
this
emergency
people
down
there,
and
i
can't
see
how
we
can't
classify
that
as
disturbing
tranquility
report
when
we
have
a
case
here
which
is
only
interested
in
the
sealed
liquor
in
a
ship
which
is
in
our
water.
thank
you.
