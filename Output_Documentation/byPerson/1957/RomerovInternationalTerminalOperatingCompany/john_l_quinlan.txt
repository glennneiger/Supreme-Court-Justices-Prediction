mr.
john
l.
quinlan
may
it
please,
your
honor
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
compania
trasatlantica
that
is
the
spanish
line,
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
also
for
garcia
&
diaz,
the
agents,
both
are
named
defendants
in
the
suit.
i
address
myself
first
to
the
interest
of
the
spanish
line,
compania
trasatlantica.
the
single
or
rather
major
point
by
the
respondent
compania
in
the
lower
courts
and
here
is
simply
whether
this
seaman
can
maintain
suit
under
the
jones
act
and
under
the
general
admiralty
law
against
respondent
compania
trasatlantica.
i
would
like
to
touch
on
the
facts
and
the
procedure
as
it
went
on
in
the
district
court.
in
the
answer
of
compania
trasatlantica
and
it
appeared
generally
and
it
does
not
say
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
does
not
have
a
jurisdiction
of
a
complaint
upon
which
the
face
of
it
stakes.
there
is
an
action
under
the
jones
act,
no
question
of
the
jurisdictions
of
the
district
court.
the
point
we
raised
in
our
pleadings
and
the
point
we
raised
in
the
district
court
was
that
this
spanish
seaman
could
not
maintain
suit
against
this
spanish
corporation
under
the
jones
act
and
under
the
general
admiralty
law.
the
suit
was
on
the
law
side
of
the
federal
court.
the
defendant
compania
asked
the
court
to
consider
the
defenses
raising
that
preliminary
to
trial.
the
authority
for
that,
the
authority
for
that
is
in
rule
12
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
i've
quoted
that
rule
on
pages
25
and
26
in
my
brief
and
that
rule
provides
that
where
defenses
such
as
those
raised
by
the
spanish
line
and
its
answers
are
presented
and
the
party
asked
the
district
court
to
consider
the
defenses
preliminary
to
trail,
those
defenses,
the
rule
said
shall
be
heard
and
determined
before
trial
on
application
of
any
party
unless
the
court
orders
that
the
hearing
and
determination
thereof
be
deferred
until
the
trial.
the
rule
further
provides
that
a
defense
which
they
have
numbered
six,
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted,
but
if
that
rule
is
considered
the
district
court
can
go
outside
the
complaint,
outside
the
pleadings,
take
testimony
or
consider
other
factors
and
other
matters
and
shall
treat
the
motion
as
one
for
its
summary
judgment
under
rule
56.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
quite
simple.
if
we
accept
the
petitioner's
position,
no
motion
after
a
defendant
has
appeared
generally
in
an
action,
no
motion
addressed
to
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
to
maintain
the
action
could
ever
be
heard
in
the
district
court.
we
have
to
go
through
a
full
trial
even
it
took
weeks
and
then
at
the
end
of
that
trial
with
the
court
undoubtedly
in
many
cases
its
mind
made
up
that
the
action
could
be
maintained
would
then
briefly
in
an,
a
matter
of
second
say
this
action
can
not
be
maintained.
practice
in
our
courts
--
that
just
not
is
not
it
and
it
just
cannot
be.
that
is
how
the
hearing
came
on
before
judge
sugerman
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
maintain
this
act
under
the
jones
act
and
the
general
admiralty
law.
i
asked
for
it
and
the
other
defendants
on
behalf
of
their
respective
clients
asked
for
it
whether
it's
compania
trasatlantica
the
principally
asked
for
and
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
don't
think
i
quite
get
your
honor's
point.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that
is
one
of
my
positions,
sir.
i
say
and
my
position
is
based
on
this.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yes,
that
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states
cannot
be
applied
to
this
particular
seaman
and
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
am
talking
about
the
general
maritime
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
am
talking
about
the
general
maritime
law
sir,
that
this
seaman
cannot
make
claim
under
our
general
maritime
law
and
the
district
courts
should
not
apply
it
to
it.
the
district
courts
have
power
to
apply
the
general
maritime
law
to
anyone
in
any
situation,
but
i
say
as
to
this
one
and
in
this
situation
it
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
say
it
should
not
be
applied
and
i
say
further
for
other
reasons,
it
cannot
be
applied.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well,
i
say
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
say
the
general
maritime
law
as
well
as
the
jones
act
cannot
be
applied
to
this
seaman
for
the
following
reasons.
a
spanish
national,
resident
of
spain
on
a
spanish
flagged
vessel,
registered
in
spain
on
a
voyage
from
spain
out
and
returning
to
spain
under
a
contract
or
articles
of
agreement
providing
that
in
the
event
of
injury
his
rights
shall
be
governed
by
the
code
law
of
spain
and
spain
only
has
code
law,
i
say
that
the
district
court
cannot
apply
the
general
admiralty
law
to
this
man
for
the
very
reasons
this
court
said
the
jones
act
could
not
be
applied
in
the
lauritzen
against
larsen
case.
that
the
law
of
the
flag
prevails,
that
the
man's
contract
with
his
employer
must
be
respected
and
i
say
further
as
in
that
case,
in
this
particular
case,
this
man,
this
seaman,
the
law
of
spain
gives
him
adequate
remedy
and
compels
his
employer,
the
steamship
line,
to
ensure
his
rights
under
those
remedies.
this
man,
under
spanish
code
law,
applying
to
spanish
seaman
on
spanish
flagged
vessels,
will
receive
for
life
and
this
is
far
more
generous
than
most
of
our
united
states
state
compensation
acts,
will
receive
for
life
from
between
35%
and
50%
of
his
wages.
he
can
have
a
hearing
in
the
compensation
courts
in
spain
which
they
refer
to
as
a
labor
court
and
within
that
compensation
court
or
labor
court
he
establishes
that
his
employer,
the
steamship
line
was
negligent.
his
compensation
can
be
increased,
50%
for
a
life.
under
another
section
of
the
code
law
of
spain
his
medical
bills
are
paid
by
his
employer's
insurer
as
the
same
as
our
cure
here.
he
is
furnished
maintenance
the
same
as
under
american
law.
under
spanish
law
he
has
remedies
identical
with
those
of
american
seaman,
except
for
an
american
seaman
sues
for
a
lump
sum,
spanish
seaman
gets
his
compensation
right
and
maybe
far
better
off
because
he
never
has
to
prove
negligence
to
get
the
original
35-50%.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
oh
yes,
yes
sir.
yes
sir
that
compensation
is
--
it
is
generous
compensation
act.
it
is
far
older
that
our
compensation,
any
compensation
act
we
have
in
this
country
and
has
existed
for
many,
many
years.
on
the
assertion
that
the
spanish
line
did
not
pay
the
hospital
bills
for
this
man
i
want
to
say
briefly
on
that.
garcia
&
diaz,
the
agents
for
the
spanish
line,
it
all
appears
in
the
record,
all
this
is
in
the
record,
informed
st.
mary's
hospital
in
hoboken
as
well
as
the
attending
physician
that
their
bills
would
be
paid.
about
june
11,
the
attending
physician
advised
garcia
&
diaz,
the
agents
here,
that
this
man
could
leave
the
hospital,
was
well
enough
to
leave
the
hospital
and
enquiry
was
made
of
him,
is
he
in
sufficient
condition
to
repatriate
to
spain?
now
it
was
the
duty
of
the
spanish
line
to
take
this
seaman
out
of
the
port
of
the
united
station
and
if
it
didn't,
be
fined
to
thousand
dollars.
they
come
in
on
a
29-day
leave;
they
must
leave
with
their
vessel.
but
if
they're
injured
they
can
stay
here
till
they
are
ready
to
leave,
but
then
it's
incumbent
on
the
employer
to
take
them
out
of
the
port,
that's
why
the
enquiry
was
made.
the
surgeon
attending
the
man
in
the
hospital
said
yes,
he
is
fit
to
travel
to
spain,
particularly
because
we
had
aboard
this
as
mr.
axtell
says
modern
two-year
old
steamship
with
all
winches
from
denmark
on
it,
which
is
not
the
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
it,
but
it
was
very
modern
new
ship;
it
had
a
ship
surgeon
on
it.
and
this
defendant
compania
through
its
agent
tendered
the
man
repatriation
and
this
defendant
through
its
agent
garcia
paid
the
doctor
his
bill
to
that
date.
and
informed
the
doctor
that
it
could
not
commit
its
principal
compania
to
any
further
medical
charges,
it
had
no
authority
to
do
it
and
should
it
do
it.
and
its
employer
has
to
pay,
it
would
be
highly
questionable
whether
compania
could
be
reimbursed
to
those
by
its
insurer.
and
spanish
line
informed
st.
mary's
hospital
to
the
same
effect
and
asked
st.
mary's
hospital
for
a
bill
to
june
11.
they
send
a
bill
to
june
14;
we
asked
them
again
for
a
bill
to
june
11.
this
agent
here
had
to
pay
a
bill
to
june
11,
had
to
account
to
its
principal
and
had
to
hand
proper
papers.
and
on
the
trial
this
action
before
judge
sugerman
the
hospital
was
again
told
that
if
it
would
submit
a
bill
to
proper
date
the
bill
would
be
paid.
this
defendant
compania
has
furnished
maintenance
and
has
furnished
cure
and
the
record
discloses
it
has
through
the
national
insurance
on
spain
setup
the
pension
of
this
man
for
life.
that
has
been
established,
it
awaits
him,
he
has
been
tendered
repatriation,
but
if
it
any
time
he
wanted
his
compensation
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
spain
because
it's
in
the
record
clearly
that
he
could
have
gone
up
on
5th
avenue,
i
think
it's
new
york
city
to
the
spanish
consulate
asked
for
his
compensation
and
asked
for
a
hearing
on
it
and
get
a
certification
from
a
doctor
and
he
would
have
been
furnished
his
compensation,
spanish
compensation
here
in
the
united
states,
he
did
not
have
to
return
to
spain
for
it.
now
as
to
the
position
of
compania
with
respect
to
the
jones
act
and
the
general
admiralty
law,
this
court
decided
in
the
lauritzen
case
that
that
danish
seaman
could
not
maintain
suit
under
the
jones
act.
that
case
did
not
involved
general
admiralty
law,
only
the
jones
act.
and
the
only
difference
between
the
lauritzen
case
and
the
present
case
on
the
jones
act
is
one,
the
accident
in
the
lauritzen
case
happened
in
cuba,
the
accident
in
this
case
happened
in
hoboken,
new
jersey
and
a
port
of
new
york.
i
say
that
everything
this
court
said
in
lauritzen
and
denying
that
man
larson,
the
right
to
man
--
to
stay
in
suit
under
the
jones
act
applies
equally
and
fully
to
this
man
and
of
the
place
of
accident
has
no
bearing
on
the
decision
of
the
question.
if
this
man
could
maintain
suit
under
the
jones
act
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
lauritzen
case
as
to
larson,
if
this
vessel
or
any
spanish
vessel,
the
vessel
of
any
nation
called
at
20
different
countries
on
a
voyage
or
10
different
countries
and
every
point
it
entered,
it
would
be
subjected
to
a
different
workmen's
law.
it
would
be
compensation,
and
in
many
of
the
ports
injury
to
a
workman
involves
penalties
and
sometimes
imprisonment
if
the
negligence
by
the
(inaudible)
is
semi-criminal.
if
it's
what
we
would
call
gross
negligence,
they
would
call
in
some
countries
criminal
and
a
man
could
be
put
in
jail
for
it.
but
every
port
this
vessel
would
go
into,
this
employer
would
be
subjected
to
different
law
and
in
the
lauritzen
case
this
court
said
that
should
not
be.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
in
bilbao,
spain.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
they
signed
at
new
york
but
that
was
non-attended
man
have
been
sick
here
in
the
case
and
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
they
said
it
meant
not
be.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
he
signed
them
in
new
york,
yes.
in
that
case
the
seaman
did
say.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
the
seaman's
act
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well
that's,
the
seaman's
act
1915,
sir
is
what
we
now
refer
to
it
as
the
jones
act.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no
it
did
not
sir.
the
act
which
was
amended
to
give
foreign
seaman,
it's
an
entirely
different
statute.
that
was
the
wage
statute
which
provided
that
any
seaman
could
demand
one
half
his
earned
wages
in
any
port.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
as
earned
wages
only.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
to
recover
them?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
and
they
said
recovered
them
in
american
court.
now
that
sir
as
it
originally
was
written
and
then
subsequently
was
amended
to
say
that
provided
further
a
foreign
seaman
can
demand
half
his
earned
wages
in
an
american
port
and
shall
have
liberty
to
go
into
an
american
court
to
procure
them
if
they
are
not
paid
to
him.
i
think
that
is
very
important
when
thinking
of
the
jones
act
and
when
considering
the
jones
act,
that
statute,
which
is
the
wage
statute
because
the
la
follette
act
which
was
the
forerunner
of
the
jones
act
and
all
that
jones
act
did
was
broaden
the
liability
features.
it
didn't
change
the
right
to
sue
and
it
didn't
create
any
new
defendants
or
any
new
plaintiffs.
it
just
broadened
and
it
wiped
out
more
fellow-servants
whose
negligence
used
to
bar.
the
la
follette
act
was
entitled,
an
act
to
promote
the
welfare
of
american
seaman
in
the
american
merchant
marine.
it
had
absolutely
nothing
in
the
heading
or
in
the
act
or
in
the
history
of
the
act
to
indicate
even
slightly
that
the
la
follette
act
when
it
was
passed
was
ever
intended
or
thought
out
as
in
the
future
applying
to
alien
seaman
on
alien
flagged
vessels,
even
though
if
hurt
in
the
port
of
new
york.
and
when
the
la
follette
act
was
amended,
that
was
1950
and
amended
in
1920,
they
then
called
it
the
jones
act
and
as
i
say
it
broadened
liability,
didn't
create
any
new
plaintiffs,
any
new
defendants
but
wiped
out
more
of
the
fellow-servant
doctrine.
at
that
time
the
act
was
again
entitled,
not
a
thing
about
an
alien
seaman,
an
act
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
american
merchant
marine.
now
as
in
a
wage
statute
which
applied
only
to
american
seaman,
they
had
to
amend
the
wage
statute,
as
mr.
axtell
refers
to
as
amending
to
make
it
apply
to
alien
seaman,
foreign
seaman
on
foreign
ships.
and
i
say
that
to
make
this
act,
the
jones
act,
apply
to
foreign
seaman
on
foreign
ships,
even
though
they
are
hurt
in
an
american
port,
that
act
has
got
to
similarly
be
amended,
because
it
originally
started
out
as
an
act
to
promote
the
welfare
of
american
seaman
in
the
american
merchant
marine.
i
would
like
briefly
to
now
address
myself
to
the
interest
of
the
respondent
garcia
&
diaz.
that
company
is
one
of
the
defendants.
it
has
offices
in
new
york,
it
has
the
deposition
and
appendix
shows
been
an
agent
for
south
american,
cuban,
spanish
steamship
lines,
ten
or
more
for
many
years.
it
was
the
agent
for
compania
trasatlantica.
it
did,
as
it
was
asked.
it
had
an
agency
contract.
it
supplied
water
and
audit
stores
and
did
the
things,
those
things
that
a
general
agent
does.
in
the
complaint
as
against
it,
it
was
alleged
that
it
owned
guadalupe
and
that
it
had
employed
this
plaintiff
and
that
it
managed
upgraded
the
control
the
vessel.
on
the
hearing
before
judge
sugarman,
it
was
conceded
that
it
did
not
own
guadalupe
and
it
was
conceded
that
it
did
not
employ
romero,
but
plaintiff's
counsel
contended
that
was
joint
employment,
or
that
was
joint
operation,
management
and
control
of
the
vessel
by
the
spanish
line
and
garcia
&
diaz.
judge
sugarman,
that
what
–
went
into
the
question
of
what
this
plaintiff
based
operation,
management
and
control
upon,
they
set
upon
the
agency
agreement.
that
was
produced,
translated
and
put
in
evidence
and
it
is
in
the
record,
(inaudible)
remotely
indicate
management,
operation
and
control
by
garcia,
the
agent.
the
testimony
of
the
treasurer
of
garcia
was
taken.
he
was
examined
by
the
plaintiff
at
length
(inaudible).
there
isn't
a
suggestion
in
this
testimony
that
garcia
&
diaz
operated,
managed
and
controlled
the
vessel.
there
isn't
a
suggestion
on
the
record
that
garcia
&
diaz
was
negligent
in
anyway
or
even
possibly
negligent
in
anyway
with
respect
to
this
man's
injuries.
on
the
hearing,
judge
sugarman
inquired
the
plaintiff's
counsel
what
more
do
you
want
on
this
question,
what
more
do
you
want
to
put
in
the
record,
what
more
do
you
want
to
produce?
they
said
we
want
the
representative
of
garcia
&
diaz,
who
was
at
the
period
of
the
day
of
the
accident,
we
want
my
tenants
to
treasurer
again
on
the
stand,
they
were
produced
and
examined
at
length
by
plaintiff's
counsel.
this
is
on
that
question
of
operation,
management
and
control
by
the
agent.
judge
sugarman
said
is
that
all
you
have,
all
you
have
to
offer,
all
you
can
offer
and
they
said
that
is
it,
there
is
nothing
more
to
offer,
no
other
proof.
and
judge
sugarman
said
you
haven't
shown
any
negligence,
you
haven't
shown
any
management,
operation
control,
you
haven't
shown
a
thing
against
garcia
&
diaz,
with
respect
to
this
plaintiff,
the
complaint
as
against
garcia
&
diaz
is
dismissed.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
nothing
sir,
they
could
not.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
as
against
garcia
&
diaz
sir?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
there
was
the
diversity
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
the
diversity
adjusted
between
garcia
&
diaz
and
this
plaintiff,
is
that
what
your
honor
mean?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well,
that
was
an
issue
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
it
was
sir
and
it
became
an
issue
in
this
way
your
honor.
judge
sugarman
first
held,
he
first
found
and
his
finding
was
that
this
seaman
could
not
maintain
suit
against
compania
trasatlantica
under
the
jones
act.
that
was
solely
and
exclusively
his
first
finding.
well,
if
this
seaman
could
have
maintained
suit
under
the
jones
act,
the
law
side
of
the
federal
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
without
diversity.
but
once
ruling
out
the
jones
act,
judge
sugarman
then
said,
now
i
must
consider
with
the
jones
act
out,
the
alignment
of
parties
and
i
now
have
a
spanish
national
plaintiff,
a
new
york
corporation,
another
new
york
corporation,
a
delaware
corporation
that
would
be
(inaudible)
in
a
national
terminal
and
garcia
&
diaz
and
the
fourth
defendant
compania
trasatlantica,
but
now
only
under
a
general
maritime
count,
not
a
statutory
count
and
he
said
there
is
accordingly
not
complete
diversity
between
the
plaintiff
and
all
the
defendants
because
the
plaintiff
is
a
spaniard
and
compania
is
a
spaniard.
well,
you
didn't
have
diversity
between
plaintiff
and
all
the
defendants.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
if
compania
was
dropped
out,
yes
sir--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
your
honor,
i
hope
your
honor
is
closely
directed
on
that
point
and
if
you
could
bear
with
me
a
minute
i
could
give
you
the
page
because
judge
sugarman
made
every
possible
offer,
every
possible
offer
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
every
possible
offer
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that's
right,
it's
right
in
judge--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
it's
right
in
his
opinion,
he
said
so
in
his
opinion
and
he
addressed
to
them
one
by
one
the
possibilities.
he
said
if
i
will
do
so
on
so
would
you
go
to
admiralty,
if
i
will
do
so
and
so
would
you
stay
at
law,
if
i
sever
if
i
do
this,
if
i
do
that,
he
did
everything
he
could
possibly
do
jurisdictionally.
189
at
the
–
189
at
the
bottom
we
should
start.
and
this
plaintiff
in
every
single
instance
refused
to
sever
or
refused
to
make
any
change
in
the
party
setup
or
the
cause
of
action
setup
in
the
complaint.
then
judge
sugarman,
after
they
refused
to
go
to
admiralty,
the
plaintiff
refused
to
go
to
admiralty
and
rejected
every
other
he
made
of
help,
then
said
now
having
found
that
this
seaman
is
well
taken
care
of
under
spanish
law,
and
that
he
cannot
maintain
actually
hereunder
the
general
admiralty
law,
the
jones
act,
one
because
the
statute
doesn't
apply
too
because
there
was
not
diversity,
he
exercised
his
discussion
and
refused
jurisdiction
and
admiralty.
but
that
was
not
until
acted
this
plaintiff
and
his
counsel
had
absolutely
rejected
any
help
by
leaving
this
one
part
of
law,
one
part
of
admiralty,
well
it
could
have
been
done.
the
action
could
have
been
severed
and
the
suit
against
compania
trasatlantica
alone,
that
part
of
the
suit
could
have
been
transferred
to
the
admiralty
side
right
there
by
the
judge
on
the
bench,
ample
authority
for
that,
any
number
of
cases
on
that.
and
the
case
could
have
proceeded
against
the
other
three
defendants,
the
american
corporations,
before
a
jury
right
there
and
judge
sugarman
could
have
sat
right
there
as
judge
in
admiralty
heard
all
the
evidence
and
made
his
decision
on
the
admiralty
question.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no
relief
under
the
spanish
law?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
he
could
have
taken
jurisdiction
your
honor,
but
my
years
of
working
with
the
jones
act
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
he
would
not
have
been
justified
in
granting
relief
to
this
seaman
under
the
general
admiralty
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i'd
say
yes
sir
on
the
factor
of
this
case,
i
have
to
answer
the
question,
i'd
say,
i'd
yes
for
this
reason,
as
on
this
man
–
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yeah,
when
this
man
signed
his
articles,
and
i
have
to
say
this
on
articles,
this
is
a
little
more
than
american
articles,
the
way
we
sign
in
united
states.
a
united
states
shipping
commissioner
comes
board
a
vessel.
he
has
a
fixed
sheet
of
articles
and
all
men
sign
line
up
to
line
down
edge,
next
to
kim,
rate
of
wage
and
the
like
around
the
articles,
but
in
spain
and
under
spanish
law
each
seaman
signs
an
individual
contract
sitting
down
with
the
captain.
he
and
a
captain
sign
it
individually
and
it
is
only
as
to
him.
he
then
must
go
down
to
the
director
of
the
port
similar
to
our
coastguard
and
be
cleared
as
having
a
right
to
sail.
he
must
exhibit
there
that
he
has
served
his
time
in
the
army
or
his
time
to
serve
his
government
is
not
due
and
otherwise
qualified
to
have
the
right
to
go
to
sea.
so
this
seaman
would
have
signed
a
contract
and
this
man
was
an
experienced
seaman
having
(inaudible)
many
years
and
had
signed
these
contracts
many
times
for
other
steamship
lines.
he
said
so
in
his
testimony
he
took
the
stand
at
the
hearing
and
he
knew
when
he
signed,
as
this
contract
provides
that
any
rights
in
the
event
of
injury
that
he
will
have
against
his
employer
shall
be
governed
by
spanish
law.
now
even
though
he
had
no
rights,
damage
rights
under
spanish
law,
and
the
code
law
said
he
had
no
rights,
assuming
it
did
to
go
along
with
your
honor's
question,
i
say
that
the
admiralty
court
of
the
united
states
could
not
give
this
man
any
relief
for
to
do
so
would
violate
the
contract
between
the
man
and
his
employer
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
say
to
do
it,
you
would
have
to
violate
it
and
that's
the
answer
i
make
your
honor's
question.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that
is
not
sir.
i
say
this
to
mr.
justice
whitaker.
i
did
not
ask
judge
sugarman
to
go
into
question
of
operation,
management
and
control
in
garcia
&
diaz.
i
didn't
ask
that
at
all
but
as
the
matter
evolved
and
the
stipulations
as
to
this
and
that
was
made
on
the
record
that
is
learning
issues,
judge
sugarman
went
into
that
question.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that's
right
sir,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
he
could
have
done
so
as
far
as
i
see
because
this
was
not
adjudication
on
the
merits,
but
what
this
plaintiff
wanted
throughout
the
entire
case
is
to
have
in
one
lawsuit
the
four
defendants
whom
he
says
are
the
tortfeasors
so
that
he
doesn't
stand
in
the
position
of
having
to
try
his
case
as
against
one,
two,
or
three
and
they
are
pointing
to
the
fourth
defendant
who
is
being
suited
in
another
court,
solely
by
himself.
he
wanted
to
try
his
case
as
against
the
four
defendants
at
one
time
in
one
court
and
he
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
on
the
law
side
setting
for
in
his
complaint
four
causes
of
action;
the
first
one
of
which
was
directed
against
spanish
line
and
garcia
&
diaz
under
the
jones
act
and
under
the
general
maritime
law.
the
second
cause
of
action
sought
wages
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
and
maintenance
and
cure
and
again
was
directed
as
again
the
spanish
line
and
garcia
&
diaz.
the
third
cause
of
action
was
directed
against
international
terminal
operating
company
and
said
that
there
was
diversity
of
citizenship
between
plaintiff
and
defendant
and
the
court
has
jurisdiction
under
the
general
maritime
law
and
the
fourth
cause
of
action
was
identical,
but
only
it
was
directed
against
my
client
quin
lumber
company.
now
the
plaintiff
in
opening
to
this
court
said
he
used
the
magic
words
that
he
was
suing
under
the
jones
act
and
that
brings
to
the
fore
i
think
the
argument
that
i
make
on
behalf
of
quin
lumber
in
my
brief.
if
a
plaintiff
can
merely
in
his
complaint
say
i
am
a
seaman
and
i
am
suing
you
defendant
a
under
the
jones
act
and
if
the
district
court
by
virtue
of
that
allegation
and
that
allegation
alone
is
precluded
from
enquiring
into
the
jurisdictional
facts
as
to
whether
the
jones
act
applies
to
this
seaman,
then
i
say
by
such
an
allegation
even
though
it
defaults
the
plaintiff
has
vested
jurisdiction
upon
the
district
court
and
as
i
understand
the
law,
you
don't
vest
jurisdiction
on
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
as
i
see
it
your
honor,
we
stand
all
four
here,
all
four
of
us,
on
whether
the
jones
act
applied
and
if
the
jones
act
is
applicable
to
this
plaintiff
as
against,
the
people
he
sued
under
the
jones
act
then
all
other
questions
become
academic,
but
as
against
my
client,
he
has
alleged
diversity
of
citizenship
and
the
general
maritime
law,
but
i
respectfully
say
to
you
your
honor
that
this
really
is
an
injury,
which
projects
a
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
a
plaintiff
against
multiple
alleged
tortfeasors
but
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
maybe
different
but
he
really
has
only
one
cause
of
action,
but
it
maybe
based
upon
different
statutes
or
different
laws
as
against
the
several
defendants.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
i
speak
for
the
respondents
compania
trasatlantica,
also
known
as
the
spanish
line
and
that
is
the
vessel
owner
here.
i
speak
also
for
garcia
and
diaz
and
new
york
corporation.
they
were
the
agents
or
that
corporation
was
the
agent
for
compania
trasatlantica,
the
spanish
line,
at
the
time
of
this
occurrence.
as
to
the
fact,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
this
vessel,
i
will
take
the
vessel
first,
was
a
spanish
vessel
registered
in
spain,
built
in
spain,
enrolled
in
spain
and
flying
the
spanish
flag.
the
seaman,
romero,
was
born
in
spain,
reared
in
spain,
in
the
spanish
merchant
marine
for
18n
or
20
years
prior
to
the
time
of
this
accident.
the
voyage
of
the
vessel
and
as
was
all
voyages
of
spanish
line
vessels,
originated
in
a
spanish
port
principally
in
the
port
of
bilbao.
the
vessels
would
then
touch
other
spanish
ports,
would
then
proceed
to
new
york,
then
to
cuba,
then
to
vera
cruz
and
turn
about
there
and
will
come
back
to
the
port
of
cuba,
new
york
and
back
to
spain.
the
vessels,
the
--
the
voyage
was
always
a
voyage
which
would
originate
in
spain
and
terminate
in
spain,
a
spanish
voyage.on
the
return
from
vera
cruz
to
cuba
and
to
new
york,
on
one
of
the
voyages
of
the
guadalupe,
this
accident
occurred.
romero
as
would
an
american
seaman
serving
on,
on
an
american
vessel
signed
articles.
the
articles
in
spain
or
spanish
articles
are
somewhat
different
than
the
articles
that
american
seamen
signs,
are
articles
every
seaman
signs
the
same
articles
before
the
shipping
commissioner,
now
the
coast
guard
officer
and
before
the
captain.
in
spain,
each
seaman
signs
an
individual
article
or
contract
with
the
captain
on
behalf
of
the
employer
and
is
then
cleared
through
the
counterpart
of
our
coast
guard
or
port
director.
romero
signed
those
articles
in
spain
to
sail
on
the
guadalupe.
and
those
articles
provided
and
he
as
i
point
out
that
he
had
sailed
in
the
spanish
merchant
marine
for
some
18
or
20
years
and
there
was
no
unfamiliarity
on
his
part
as
to
his
rights
or
as
to
the
conditions
of
the
articles
and
they
provided
and
i
read
from
them
briefly,
“agree
to
sign
the
present
contract
in
compliance
with
the
following
conditions
and
both
parties
subject
to
the
provisions
established
by
the
codes
and
laws
regulating
commerce
and
labor
and
also
all
other
regulations
enforced.
one
of
the
conditions
referred
to
which
follow
is
condition
22,
that
provides,
in
the
event
of
accidents
occurring
during
the
accomplishment
of
this
contract,
these
will
be
subject
to
the
legislative
provisions
enforced
to
this
effect
and
also
all
such
will
be
complied
with
regarding
social
insurances
as
determined
by
the
laws.”

here
i
contend
the
--
romero.
it
--
thus
expressly
contracted
that
in
the
event
of
injury
his
rights
against
his
employer
would
be
governed
by
the
codes,
laws
and
regulations
of
spain.
and
by
that
provision,
in
22,
wherein
it
says
“and
all
such
will
be
complied
with
regarding
social
insurances
as
determined

laws
that
refer
to

spanish
line
was
required
to
comply
with
those
provisions
and
regulations
regarding
the
social
insurances
as
determined
by
the
laws.
and
what
were
they?
they
were
these,
upon
the
employer.
the
employer
was
required
as
an
employer
of
an
--
workman
here
in
this
country
to
establish
what
--
they
are
referred
to
in
their
contract
as
a
pension.
it
is
the
same
as
our
workmen's
compensation
laws.
it's
handled
a
little
differently.
it's
contributed
to
by
the
employer
on
the
basis
of
wages
and
hours
worked
by
a
man.
it
works
out
finally
the
same
as
our
workmen's
compensation
law
but
to
a
greater
benefit
to
the
man,
in
that,
there
is
something
established
for
him
and
that
is
in
the
record,
which
cannot
be
taken
away
from
him,
ever
by
the
government,
by
the
employer
or
anyone
else
or
in
any
manner.
and
here,
under
the
law
of
spain
which
is
a
coast
country,
which
does
not
have
any
general
admiralty
law
such
as
we
have
here
but
what
this
which
does
have
the
code
sections
which
give
him
his
right,
this
man
as
was
testified
on
the
trial
by
the
chief
attorney.
it's
all
in
the
record
in
the
brief
that
i
brought
here
for
the
hearing
before
judge
sugarman,
the
chief
attorney
for
that
social
body
that
governs
their
social
security,
workmen's
compensation
that
entire
body
of
spain
came
here
and
testified
on
this
trial.
testified
he
reviewed
romero's
record
before
he
came
here.
he
did
at
my
request
so
that
he
could
testify
as
to
what
this
man's
rights
were
as
to
what
he
was
entitled
to
because
of
this
injury.
and
he
testified
that
this
man
would
receive
35%
of
his
wages
for
life
under
the
spanish
system
and
that
in
the
event
the
employer
was
found
to
have
been
negligent
he
would
receive
the
35%
irrespective
of
negligence.
but
in
the
event,
in
a
labor
court
which
would
be
our
--
the
same
as
our
compensation
proceeding,
it
was
proved
the
employer
was
negligent,
he
would
receive
or
could
receive
as
much
as
50%
of
the
one-third
of
this
outside
possibility
would
be
approximately
50%
of
his
wages
for
life.
he
would
certainly
get
one-third,
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
negligence,
to
increase
that
one-third
by
50%
of
it.
but
he
could
not
be
denied
and
cannot
be
denied
and
there
awaits
him
today
one-third
of
his
wages
for
life
from
the
time
of
his
accident
and
it
cannot
be
taken
away
from
him
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
in
american
dollar,
sir?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
believe
that
the
spanish
seaman
at
this
time
received
50
pesetas,
a
day
was
their
key
which
was
evaluated
at
that
time
at
approximately,
i
think
20
pesetas
a
day
and
to
convert
that
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well,
it's
one-third,
at
least
one-third
of
his
wages.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
it
does
not
show,
sir.
it
has
never
been
computed.
no.
it
does
not
show.
and
i
would
have
to
convert
pesetas
into
dollars
and
multiply
by
days
or
i
--
that
was
the
only
way.
it's
mathematical,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
for
life
as
long
as
he
lives.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well,
he
would
get
his
lump
sum.
he
--
he
could
have
started
getting
his
one-third
of
his
wages
for
life.
just
--
let
me
go
back
one
step.
he
was
immediately
informed
and
it's
in
the
record
in
the
spanish
letter
by
his
employer
and
he
was
immediately
informed
after
the
accident
by
his
employer,
it's
in
the
appendix,
the
letter
from
his
employer
again
is
in
the
appendix,
in
my
appendix
filed
in
spanish.
i
have
furnished
this
court
a
translation
of
that.
and
his
employer
informed
him
--
the
accident
was
in
may,
his
employer
informed
him
in
august,
“immediately,
upon
receiving
advice
of
the
unfortunate
accident
which
you
suffered,
this
company
hastened
to
guarantee
you
the
maximum
benefits
established
by
the
standing
social
legislation
of
spain,
in
favor
of
crews
and
for
that
purpose,
a
representative
of
this
company
immediately
contacted
the
national
chest
of
workmen's
accidents
which
is
an
official
entity
of
the
ministry
of
labor
to
notify
them
of
the
accident
suffered
by
you
and
to
initiate
an
incapacity
file
so
that
in
due
time,
the
pension
to
which
you
are
entitled
may
be
rendered.”
now,
this
was
the
--
a
pointless
procedure,
your
honors'
thought.
“the
procedure
in
this
case
is
in
abeyance
up
until
such
time
as
you
have
recovered
from
the
injuries
you
have
received
and
your
degree
of
incapacity
for
working
is
determined.
for
this
purpose,
it
is
necessary
that
you
submit
to
an
examination
by
this
company's
physicians
as
well
as
by
the
physicians
of
the
national
chest
above
mentioned.
on
their
medical
report,
once
their
medical
reports
are
issued,
the
national
chest
will
determine
the
amount
of
the
pension
corresponding
to
you.”
on
the
paragraph,
“we
wish
to
inform
you
that
this
compania
trasatlantica
has
in
deposit
with
the
national
chest
enough
capital
to
defray
your
pension.”
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
how
much
is
the
peseta
now?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
50
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
50
for
pesetas,
three
weeks
ago,
to
the
dollar.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
50,
i
believe,
it
was
50
pesetas
per
day.
it
was
the
equivalent
of
20
or
25
pesetas
per
day
for
keep.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
though
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
30
cents
a
day
which
in
america,
the
$1
he
got
a
day
in
spain,
economic
--
the
economic
comparison.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yes.
in
spain
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
--
that
dollar
is
the
same
as
$5
or
$6
here.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that
i
have
in
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
--
that
i
have
on
the
record,
your
honor,
and
i
will
explain
it
and
i
have
done
everything
i
could
possibly
do
in
that
connection.
the
spanish
code
law
not
only
gives
this
fellow
his
indemnity
compensation
and
spain
is
no
different
than
norway,
sweden,
denmark,
holland,
mexico,
brazil,
argentina.
they
all
have
a
compensation
system
rather
than
an
indemnity
or
suit
or
negligence
system
such
as
we
have.
now,
the
spanish
code
gives
him
his
right
to
his
pension
for
life.
and
the
spanish
code
in
the
record
and
dealt
within
my
brief
and
judge
sugarman
found
that
after
the
spanish
experts
want
for
me
--
have
i
called
to
spain,
one
that
was
called
by
romero
who
was
a
leading
and
brilliant
lawyer
in
spain,
professor
in
the
university
of
madrid
and
who
had
been
the
minister
of
labor
in
spain
was
called,
it
was
agreed.
he
got
these
rights
and
in
addition
the
spanish
code
gave
him
the
full
counterpart
of
our
maintenance
and
the
full
counterpart
of
our
cure.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no.
here's
what
happened
with
the
bill.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
the
answer
--
yes.
the
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
just
and
the
same
as
an
american
steamship
owner
is
responsible
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
--
for
maintenance
and
cure.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yes,
there
is
a
controversy
over
the
hospital
bill
and
i'd
like
to
explain
it
to
your
honor.
when
the
doctor,
not
my
doctor,
but
the
doctor
in
the
hospital
attending
romero
certified
that
romero
--
his
recovery
was
such
that
he
could
travel
on
a
ship
back
to
spain,
i
paid
that
doctor
and
instructed
the
company
and
we
did
pay
that
doctor,
his
bill
to
that
date.
and
on
that
date
i
notified
or
had
the
agent
on
behalf
of
the
spanish
line
notify
the
hospital
that
as
agents
they
could
not
be
responsible
for
any
bills
incurred
at
the
hospital
subsequent
to
that
date
and
that
if
they
would
submit
their
bill
to
that
date,
it
would
be
immediately
paid.
they
have
been
told
that
by
a
letter
before.
the
hospital
then
and
subsequently
and
on
the
trial
on
the
district
court,
were
again
told
that
--
told
--
they've
been
told
time
and
again
that
if
they
would
submit
a
bill
to
that
date
the
bill
would
be
paid
by
the
agent
on
behalf
of
the
spanish
line.
the
hospital
has
persisted
in
first
giving
the
bill
beyond
the
date
and
then
giving,
after
being
told
and
how
to
explain
to
him
by
judge
sugarman
in
court,
submit
the
bill
of
the
date
when
the
doctor
said
the
man
could
travel
back
to
spain,
it
will
be
paid,
and
they
have
not
presented
the
bill,
never.
and
if
that
bill
is
presented
today
up
to
that
day
when
the
doctor
said
he
can
travel
back
to
spain,
it
will
be
paid.
the
doctor
was
paid.
everything
else
was
paid.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no,
his
doctor
did.
not
mine.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
the
doctor
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
my
doctor?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
his
doctor
said
he's
now
healed
up.
he's
ready
for
repatriation.
he
needs
a
convalescent
period.
i
said,
“all
right.
we
have
a
vessel
here.
we
have
a
surgeon
on
it.
we
have
a
hospital
on
the
vessel,
a
modern
vessel
only
two
years
old
at
that
time.
we're
ready
to
send
him
back
to
spain.”
i
tendered
repatriation
or
had
the
agent
tender
repatriation
to
this
man
say
here,
"here's
the
ship.
we'll
have
you
sent
back
to
spain.”
i
notified
the
immigration
that
was
continually
in
touch
with
the
agent
as
to
--
you're
going
to
send
the
man
back
to
spain.
he
was
a
spanish
national.
he
had
overstayed
his
29
days.
i
told
immigration,
"i
am
ready.
i
have
a
vessel.
he
can
go
back
to
spain.”
we
tendered
him
the
repatriation.
subsequent
to
that,
he
was
notified
that
as
to
his
compensation
rights,
if
he
didn't
want
to
go
back
to
spain
for
this
medical
examination
by
a
representative
of
national
chest,
if
he
would
go
to
the
spanish
consul
in
new
york
and
ask
him
to
have
his
incapacity
examined
into
by
a
physician
of
the
national
chest,
the
consul
would
communicate
with
the
national
chest,
receive
authority
to
have
a
physician
examine
him
and
his
incapacity
could
be
determined
here.
he
didn't
have
to
go
back
to
spain
even
to
have
it
determined.
he'd
never
been
near
the
spanish
consul
because
of
the
suit
which
has
started.
summons
to
the
complaint
actually
filed
12
days
after
the
accident
actually
filed
in
court
12
days
after
the
accident.
nothing
to
do
with
the
spanish
consul,
nothing
to
do
with
the
national
chest,
this
suit
and
because
of
this
suit,
there
has
been
no
effort,
whatsoever,
by
this
man
to
have
his
pension
rights
determined.
he
doesn't
want
them
determined.
he
wants
this
suit.
he
wants
a
jury
trial.
he
wants
to
try
to
recover
in
american
law,
avoid
the
provision
in
his
articles
and
avoid
the
law
of
spain.
now
as
to
that
law
of
spain,
i
have
reached
this
point
i
can
mention
it
briefly
here.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
now,
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
as
to
the
hospital
bill,
we're
back
to
that
again.
i'll
pay
the
hospital
bill
up
until
he
was
ready
to
leave.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no,
until
his
doctor
--
now
i
didn't
select
the
hospital
doctor.
he
was
injured
on
the
ship
taken,
off
the
ship
and
taken
to
the
hospital
and
a
surgeon
and
doctor
in
the
hospital
took
care
of
him
and
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
selection
of
the
doctor.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yes,
certainly.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
the
doctor
said
he's
fit
for
discharge
in
the
hospital.
he's
ready
for
discharge
in
the
hospital.
i
said,
then
my
question
to
this,
"is
he
fit
to
travel
back
to
spain?"
he
said,
"he's
ready
for
discharge
in
the
hospital.
his
wound
is
healed
over.
there's
no
further
need
of
surgery
or
medical
attention,
there's
only
a
need
now
for
rest
until
the
skin
over
the
stump
hardens
up
and
a
leg,
artificial
leg
could
be
fitted.
and
we
are
ready
to
discharge
him.”
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
not
at
that
point,
no.
it
would
require
toughening
of
the
skin
and
the
fitting
leg
which
was
done
not
too
long
after
that
surgery.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
can
--
i
can
answer
it.
i
can
answer
it,
your
honor.
i
can
answer
it.
the
immigration
authorities
permit
a
seaman,
a
foreign
seaman
as
they'd
done
continuously
and
i've
seen
it
over
the
30
years,
i've
been
practicing
marine
law,
where
he
has
a
claim
or
a
suit
and
freeze
it.
immigration
will
defer.
he's
--
was
sent
out
of
the
country
until
after
his
litigation
has
been
concluded.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
he
--
he
said
--
he's
supposed
to
be
a
visitor
and
he's
not
supposed
to
work
and
he's
supposed
to
be
permitted
to
stay
here
for
that
purpose.
now,
as
to
whereabouts,
he's
here
in
court
today
enjoying
this
argument,
i
hope.
he's
sitting
here
in
court
today.
now,
as
to
the
hospital
bill,
we'll
pay
it
up
till
the
day
that
doctor
said
that.
and
the
reason
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
it
might
be,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
it
might
be,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i
didn't
mean
at
any
such
derogatory
sense
in
anyway.
well,
i
do
know
the
man
personally,
myself,
and
i
took
it
that
it
was
placed
upon
to
be
here.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no,
sir.
he
gets
that
one
third
of
his
salary
for
life.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
and
he
is
permitted
without
any
deduction
or
reduction
in
that
one-third
to
work
in
any
capacity
he
pleases.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yes,
and
he
can
earn
as
much
as
he
pleases
without
any
reduction
on
that.
in
that
way,
that
particular
code
law
differs
from
our
workmen's
compensation
where
your
statutes,
which
that
you
have
here,
which
your
award
is
frequently
reduced
by
the
ability
to
earn.
it
isn't
in
this
instance.
and
as
to
the
hospital
bill
we
will
pay
it
up
to
that
date,
your
honor,
in
the
st.
mary's
hospital,
makes
its
claim
against
the
spanish
vessel
owner.
they
won't
make
claim
against
the
man.
it
will
make
claim
against
the
spanish
vessel
owner
and
they
continually
have
vessels
in
here
and
have
an
agent
here.
and
they
established
--
the
hospital
establishes
that
this
man
was
not
fit
for
discharge
in
the
hospital
on
that
day.
the
hospital
will
be
entitled
to
recover
from
the
spanish
line
those
amounts
above
the
amounts
which
we
say
and
agree
are
due.
the
balance
of
the
hospital
bill,
i
can't
say
that
if
the
man
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
hospital
under
medical
procedures
for
eight
months
the
bill
will
be
paid
for
eight
months,
but
we
could
only
go
on
what
the
doctor
himself,
his
doctor
said
or
the
spanish
line
could
not
commit
its
insurer
for
charges
beyond
that
time
and
have
the
spanish
line
agree
to
pay
charges
beyond
that
time.
the
spanish
line
would
not
be
reimbursed
by
its
insurer.
so
it
has
no
option
but
have
to
take
the
course
which
it
took
in
that
particular
situation.
now,
i
wish
to,
at
this
point,
to
touch
on
the
--
the
pretrial
procedures
which
were
had
in
the
district
court.
in
the
answer
of
compania
trasatlantica
in
the
suit,
there
were
pleaded
the
defenses
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
persons,
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
pleaded
also
the
defense
that
this
man's
rights
were
wholly
and
exclusively
under
spanish
law
because
of
his
contract
and
that
he
was
relegated
to
that
law
and
could
not
press
claim
against
his
employer
under
any
other
law.
and
in
the
defenses
set
up
by
compania
trasatlantica
was
the
defense
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
and
the
defendant
compania,
as
well
as
the
other
defendants,
asked
for
a
preliminary
hearing
on
those
defenses.
rule
12
of
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
provides
that
the
defenses
specifically
enumerated
one
to
seven
and
my
defenses
were
one
and
six.
whether
made
in
the
pleading
or
by
a
motion
and
the
motion
for
judgment
mentioned
in
subdivision
(c)
of
this
rule
shall
be
heard
and
determined
before
trial
on
application
of
any
party
unless
the
court
orders
at
the
hearing
and
determination
thereof
be
deferred
until
the
trial.
i
made
application
for
a
hearing
of
those
defenses
preliminary
to
trial
before
judge
sugarman,
and
judge
sugarman
thereupon
proceeded
to
dispose
of
those
defenses.
as
to
the
assertion
of
judge
sugarman
went
--
did
something
which
the
petitioner
here
did
not
agree
to.
the
record
shows
that
judge
sugarman
addressed
himself
to
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
and
said
to
the
court,
"i
don't
understand
the
basis
of
your
objection.
are
you
objecting
to
my
proceeding
with
the
pretrial
hearing?"
mr.
fonte.
“no.
my
objection
is
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
going,
although,
your
honor
is
being
very
fair.”
judge
sugarman
proceeded
to
determine
whether
this
man
could
maintain
action.
he
then
proceeds
to
the
them,
this
man
could
maintain
aceess
under
the
jones
act.
if
he
could
not
maintain
an
action
under
the
jones
ac,
could
he
maintain
action
under
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
united
states?
and
in
determining
and
in
proceeding
to
determine
those
questions
and
also
the
question
as
to
ownership
operations
management
and
control
of
the
vessel
which
was
alleged
on
the
part
of
garcia
and
diaz,
the
agents,
judge
sugarman
took
testimony.
he
took
testimony
of
expert
on
spanish
law
called
by
the
respondents,
spanish
line.
he
took
testimony
from
expert
on
spanish
law
called
by
the
petitioner
and
took
the
test
--
took
the
agency
contract
into
evidence
and
took
other
documents
and
papers
in
the
evidence
and
afforded
petitioner
every
opportunity
to
offer
anything
he
wished
and
as
much
time
as
he
wished
on
those
issues
and
at
the
conclusion
of
those
issues
determined
that
romero,
the
petitioner,
could
not
maintain
suit
under
the
jones
act,
could
not
maintain
suit
under
the
general
admiralty
law.
he
then
offered,
judge
sugarman
did,
severance
of
action,
severance
between
parties.
he
offered
to
severe
the
action
leaving
compania
trasatlantica
out
of
it
and
let
the
other
three
defendants
where
diversity
did
exist
between
the
spanish
plaintiff
and
the
new
york
corporation
--
two
new
york
corporations,
one
delaware
corporation
at
law
and
possibly
transfer
the
suit
against
the
spanish
line
into
admiralty.
they
offered
to
transfer
all
the
actions
held.
he
offered
any
severance
or
any
manipulation
of
the
action
by
parties
to
petitioner
and
petitioner
rejected
them
but
petitioner
stated
to
the
court,
he
wished
to
have
the
action
stay
as
it
was
at
law
against
all
the
parties.
and
judge
sugarman
then
found
action
could
not
be
maintained
under
the
jones
act
and
could
not
be
maintained
under
general
admiralty
law
by
this
man.
found
that
the
man
had
rights
under
the
spanish
law
or
indemnity
rights
under
the
spanish
law
which
were
the
counterpart
of
our
maintenance
and
cure,
and
refused
discretionary
jurisdiction
and
admiralty
because
the
man
could
proceed
before
the
labor
code
in
spain
or
proceed
before
the
spanish
consul
in
new
york.
i
address
myself
now
to
the
claim
that
this
man
may
maintain
action
under
the
jones
act.
i'd
say
that
he
cannot
and
in
connection
with
that
argument
i
deal
with
the
strathearn
case
and
the
point
made
by
mr.
axtell,
that
there
is
an
indication
in
section
33
which
was
in
abundance
of
enactments.
that
the
jones
act
was
intended
for
the
benefit
of
foreign
seamen
and
this
act
shall
refer
to
the
brief
of
the
norwegian
shipping
association
or
mr.
watson's
brief.
mr.
watson,
on
page
18,
does
not
refer
to
the
jones
act.
mr.
watson
refers
to
the
wage
act,
section
4
of
the
act
dealing
with
half
wages
and
not
with
respect
to
the
jones
act,
which
is
another
section.
now,
the
wage
act,
no
question
the
wage
act
which
provides
that
any
seaman
has
a
right
to
demand
earned
wages
and
if
they
are
not
paid
has
a
right
to
bring
suit
in
the
courts
before
them,
now
that's
statute,
the
wage
statute
goes
on
to
say
provided
further
that
a
foreign
seaman
on
a
foreign
vessel
may
also
demand
his
wages
in
a
united
states
court
and
if
they
are
not
paid
by
the
foreign
owner
he
also
can
proceed
in
the
united
states
court.
that
was
the
wage
statute.
that
is
the
statute
referred
to
in
the
congressional
record,
not
the
jones
act.
now,
the
jones
act
simply
says
the
seaman
may
sue
for
his
personal
injury.
and
had
the
court
wanted
to
extend
the
jones
act
similar
to
foreign
seamen
who
might
be
injured
in
the
united
states
port.
all
congress
had
to
do
was
to
go
right
along
with
one
of
these
other
sectors
as
they
enacted
and
say
provided
also
that
any
foreign
seaman
injured
in
the
united
states
port
on
a
foreign
flag
vessel
may
bring
suit
in
our
courts
under
the
statutes.
but
the
congress
didn't
do
that.
it
said
they
could
do
it
in
a
wage
section,
entirely
different
section
but
did
not
say
that
could
be
done
under
the
jones
act.
that
is
the
distinction,
which
i
make
between
(inaudible)
case
dealt
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
that
wage
statute,
the
wage
statute
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
jones
act,
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it.
now,
the
lauritzen
case
decided
by
this
court
is
the
case
that
this
respondent
relies
upon
for
its
position
that
suit
cannot
be
maintained
by
this
man
under
the
jones
act.
the
lauritzen
case
differs
from
the
present
case
only
in
this.
in
the
lauritzen
case,
the
accident
happened
in
a
non-united
states
port,
in
cuba.
and
it
differs
in
this
further
respect
in
the
lauritzen
case,
the
action
was
under
the
jones
act
only,
whereas,
here
the
action
is
under
the
jones
act
and
under
the
general
admiralty
law
as
well.
those
are
the
two
differences
that
distinguish
the
two
cases.
what
was
said
in
the
lauritzen
case,
i
say,
applies
equally
here
on
the
law
of
the
flag.
this
court
said
perhaps
the
most
venerable
and
universal
rule
of
maritime
law
relevant
to
our
problem
is
that
which
gives
(inaudible)
importance
for
the
law
of
the
flag.
i
pointed
out
that
everything
here,
the
men,
the
ship,
the
voyage,
everything
is
spanish
except
the
fact
that
the
accident
happened
in
this
port.
and
this
court
said
that
after
considering
all
the
facts
which
might
have
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
jones
act
could
apply
and
override
the
law
of
the
flag,
this
court
found
that
all
these
considerations
are
of
such
weight
in
favor
of
danish
against
the
american
law
in
this
case,
that
it
must
prevail
unless
some
heavy
counterweight
appears,
this
court,
by
no
heavy
counterweight,
despite
the
fact
that
in
the
lauritzen
case,
lauritzen
signed
his
articles
of
employment,
in
a
united
states
court.
he
signed
on
that
vessel
in
our
port.
the
court
found
that
was
not
a
sufficient
counterweight.
and
i
say
that
if
signing
his
contract
here
is
not
sufficient
counterweight
to
override
the
law
of
the
flag,
the
simple
fact
that
the
accident
occurs
here
is
not
sufficient
to
overweigh
the
right
of
the
law
of
the
flag
particularly,
where
the
man
by
his
contract
agreed
in
the
event
of
injury,
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
spain.
that
was
on
the
law
of
the
flag.
then
this
court
said
on
the
contract
that
on
the
contract,
the
article
“except
as
forbidden
by
some
public
policy
the
tendency
of
the
law
is
to
apply
in
contract
matters
the
law
which
the
parties
intended
to
apply.”
and
that
in
the
lawsuit
case,
lauritzen
against
larsen,
this
court
said
that
this
arrangement
is
so
natural
and
compatible
with
the
policy
of
the
law
that
in
the
absence
--
that
even
in
the
absence
of
an
express
provision,
it
would
probably
have
them
implied,
in
effect
saying
that
even
if
the
man
had
not
agreed
to
be
bound
by
danish
law,
having
then
signed
the
danish
contract,
it
would
be
implied
that
he
would
be
governed
by
danish
law.
there
is
no
evidence
here
as
was
shown
in
the
lauritzen
case,
also,
of
any
hardship
on
the
man,
any
injustice.
there's
nothing
against
our
public
policy
to
apply
the
contract
which
a
man
has
entered
into
between
himself
and
his
employer.
had
he
been
injured
in
the
port
of
--
a
port
of
spain,
those
would
have
been
his
rights,
those
would
been
his
remedies,
that
would
have
been
the
amount
he
received,
and
it
would
have
been
compatible
with
the
economy
of
spain.
but
here,
because
he
is
injured
here,
this
man
wishes
to
recover
not
in
accordance
with
the
wages
he
was
paid.
and
in
comparison
to
them,
and
in
comparison
to
the
life
which
he
will
live
in
spain,
he's
a
spanish
national,
he
must
return
there
when
his
litigation
has
ended
here,
but
under
american
law
simply
and
only
because
the
accident
occurred
here
that
this
is
the
first
instance
in
which
this
court
has
had
to
consider
the
problem
presented
by
this
case.
this
court
has
never
considered
whether
the
jones
act
or
the
general
admiralty
law
applied
to
a
foreign
seaman
injured
on
a
foreign
flag
vessel
on
a
foreign
voyage
in
a
united
states
port.
the
circuit
court,
the
sixth
circuit
court
in
new
york,
and
i
think
probably
only
in
new
york,
have
considered
the
question
a
number
of
times.
and
in
1942,
the
circuit
court
in
new
york
had
this
very
question
before
it
and
said,
“but
we
will
also
regard
it
as
settled
law
that
alien
seamen
serving
upon
foreign
ships
owned
by
aliens
and
bound
upon
a
voyage
which
begins
and
ends
outside
the
united
states
cannot
sue
under
the
jones
act
for
injuries
suffered
while
a
ship
happens
to
be
stopping
at
a
port
of
call
within
our
territorial
waters.”
the
circuit
court
prior
that
in
1937
in
the
pollock
(ph)
let
me
say
it
again,
the
very
case
dealt
only
with
the
jones
act.
that
was
the
case
in
1942
when
a
suit
was
only
under
the
jones
act.
prior
to
that,
in
1937,
the
circuit
court,
the
second
circuit
in
the
pollock
had
identical
case,
foreign
seaman,
foreign
flag,
foreign
ship,
was
injured
in
the
united
states
port.
but
there,
the
man
sued
not
only
under
the
jones
act
but
also
under
the
general
admiralty
law.
and
in
deciding
that
case,
the
court
said
the
libel
and
claims
not
only
under
the
maritime
law
but
also
under
33
of
the
jones
act.
he
asked
us
to
rule
that
the
supplies
to
an
alien
seaman
on
a
foreign
ship
who
signed
on
at
a
foreign
port,
if
he
sustains
injury
in
a
port
of
the
united
states
through
the
negligence
of
fellow
seamen.
this
question
is
left
open
in
(inaudible)
presides
authority
is
meager
but
such
as
there
is
has
answered
the
question
in
the
negative.
then
in
the
ingram
and
in
the
taylor
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case,
all
southern
district
and
second
circuit
cases
and
in
other
cases
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
the
answer
has
always
been,
after
consideration
of
the
jones
act
statute
and
the
general
admiralty
law,
that
a
foreign
seaman
under
these
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here
and
such
as
they
had
in
those
cases
could
not
maintain
suit
against
his
employer
under
american
law.
and
it's
on
those
cases
and
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
lauritzen
against
larson
case
that
i
base
my
decision.
that
this
man
cannot
maintain
suit
under
the
jones
act
or
under
the
general
admiralty
law
of
the
united
states
against
this
employer
particularly
where
he
has
agreed
that
his
rights
against
his
employer,
in
the
event
of
accident,
would
be
governed
by
spanish
law.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
if
the
jones
act
specifically
cover
them?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
if
the
jones
act
specifically
covered
the
man
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
it
can,
sir.
very
well.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no
treaty
affects
this
in
anyway,
sir.
a
treaty
was
brought
into
the
picture
and
i
--
i'm
am
frank
to
say
that
even
to
this
point
i
cannot
see
how
the
treaty
between
united
states
and
spain
has
any
bearing
whatsoever
on
--
any
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
questions
we
have
here.
the
treaty
between
united
states
and
spain
didn't
give
any
right
to
a
seaman
and
when
sections
of
it
were
abrogated
and
taken
out,
nothing
could
be
possibly
taken
away
from
the
seaman.
the
situation
to
me
seems
to
be
the
--
would
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
the
same
if
there
had
never
been
any
treaty.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that's
right,
sir.
on
the
jones,
i
rest
it
--
exactly
right,
sir.
now
i've
touched
on
this.
i'll
touch
on
it
again.
that
if
this
man
could
maintain
suit
against
his
employer
here
in
the
united
states
under
the
jones
act
or
under
the
admiralty
--
general
admiralty
law
or
both,
he
would
and
he
would
be
subjecting
his
employer
to
two
responsibilities
and
possibly
two
recoveries.
there
is
no
question
he
gets
his
pension
right.
it
can't
be
taken
away
from
him.
it
awaits
him.
whenever
he
goes
to
the
consul
or
goes
to
spain,
he
will
have
it.
and
he
will
have
it
for
life
and
he
will
recover
his
back
pension
amounts.
to
give
him
an
addition,
that's
fixed.
there's
no
election.
there's
not
--
it
just
can't
be
taken
away
from
him.
if
he's
given
a
right
to
sue
under
american
law,
he
subjects
his
employer
to
two
responsibilities
and
possibly
two
recoveries.
now,
there
was
one
--
that
one
further
point
raised
by
--
raised
on
the
appeal
and
which
was
dealt
with
by
judge
sugarman
in
the
district
court.
the
one
further
main
point
was
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
on
this
law
side
of
an
action
under
the
general
admiralty
law
where
diversity
of
citizenship
was
lacking
between
the
parties.
it
was
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
the
district
court
on
its
law
side
had
the
jurisdiction
of
a
cause
of
action
if
it
was
admiralty
in
nature
even
though
there
was
not
diversity
between
the
parties.
there
was
not
diversity
between
the
plaintiff
and
all
the
defendants
here
because
the
plaintiff
was
spanish
and
the
spanish
line
corporation
is
a
spanish
corporation.
the
interrogatories
established
in
that
were
placed
in
the
record
of
that
by
a
commission
sent
to
spain,
came
back,
that
was
formerly
established.
the
second
circuit
in
the
paduano
case
decided
several
years
ago
concluded
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
such
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
complete
diversity
between
the
plaintiff
and
all
defendants.
the
first
circuit
has
decided
the
contrary,
the
third
circuit
has
decided
along
with
the
finding
of
the
second
circuit.
and
the
single
question
raised
is,
where
is
that
single
question,
“does
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction
on
its
law
side
of
a
matter
where
diversity
does
not
exist
but
simply
because
it
is
admiralty
in
nature?”
judge
dimock
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
paduano
case
in
southern
district,
pointed
out
that
section
9
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
which
contains
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
of
civil
causes
of
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
ends
with
this
sentence,
“and
the
trial
of
visions
of
fact
in
the
district
courts
in
all
causes
except
civil
causes
of
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
shall
be
by
a
jury.”
and
he
concluded,
“i
cannot
escape
the
conclusion
that
the
congress
which
made
provisions
felt
that
the
district
courts
to
which
it
applied
have
to
be
given
no
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
maritime
civil
law
by
a
common
law
remedy.”
i
go
back
to
the
older
cases,
american
insurance
company
against
canter,
decided
in
1828,
the
judiciary
act
section
9
having
been
enacted
in
1789
many
years
before
it.
and
in
the
american
insurance
against
canter
case
this
court
said,
“a
case
in
admiralty
does
not,
in
fact,
arise
under
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
holding
that
a
case
in
admiralty
could
not
be
maintained
on
the
law
side,”
and
in
personam
case
without
diversity.
then
40
years
later,
this
court
in
the
belfast
decided
in
1868
stated,
“properly
construed
the
party
under
that
provision,”
referring
to
the
judiciary
act,
“may
proceed
in
rem
in
the
admiralty
against
the
vessel,”
namely,
in
rem,
“or
he
may
bring
suit
in
personam
in
the
same
jurisdiction,”
again
referring
to
admiralty,
“or
he
may
elect
not
to
go
into
admiralty
at
all
and
may
resort
to
his
common
law
remedy
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
united
states
if
he
can
make
proper
parties
to
give
that
court
jurisdiction
of
his
case,”
referring
to
diversity,
citizens
of
different
state.
then
in
1870,
two
years
later
this
court
again
had
the
question
of
jurisdiction
on
the
law
side
before
it
and
stated
that
is
in
leon
against
galceran,
“where
the
suit
is
in
rem
against
the
ship
or
shipping
freight,
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy
is
exclusively
in
the
district
courts
as
provided
in
the
9th
section
of
the
judiciary
act.
but
when
the
suit
is
in
personam
against
the
owner
or
master
of
the
vessel,
the
mariner
may
proceed
by
libel
on
the
district
court
or
he
may
at
his
election
proceed
in
an
action
of
law
either
in
the
circuit
court
if
he
and
his
debtor
are
citizens
of
different
states
or
in
a
state
court
as
in
other
causes
of
action
or
action
cognizable
in
the
state
and
federal
courts.”
again,
recognizing
these
proceed
on
the
law
side
in
personam,
diversity
had
to
exist.
there
were
several
other
decisions
between
those
decisions
and
the
decisions
several
years
ago
by
the
southern
district
in
paduano,
the
doucette
case
in
the
first
circuit
was
decided
within
the
last
10
years,
the
jordine
case
in
the
third
circuit
was
decided
within
the
last
10
years.
the
three
cases,
recent
cases,
the
--
the
first
same
jurisdiction
could
exist
the
other
two
in
the
second
and
third
circuit
saying
it
could
not
have
all
been
decided
all
within
the
last
10
years.
and
it's
my
position
that
these
decision
in
the
second
circuit
is
supported
by
the
belfast,
leon
case
and
other
cases
decided
by
this
court
many
years
back
and
this
is
--
has
only
been
within
the
last
10
years
in
the
case
in
the
first
circuit
and
third
circuit
that
the
decisions
in
those
cases
has
been
questioned.
i
have
touched
on
the
treaty
in
which
i
say
it
has
no
application
and
i
have
touched
on
and
i
did
early
on
the
district
court
declining
human
discretionary
jurisdiction
when
it
appeared
that
the
plaintiff
would
not
consent
of
any
severance
of
his
causes
of
action
and
proceed
with
some
on
the
law
side
and
the
others
possibly
on
the
admiralty
side.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well,
i'd
like
to
address
myself.
i
didn't
want
to
take
all
the
time
but
i
can
do
that
within
just
a
very
few
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
--
minutes
here.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
yes.
i
have
not,
sir.
but
i
would
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that
is,
sir.
garcia
was
named
a
defendant
as
--
because
--
simply
because
they
were
they
the
shoreside
agent.garcia
was
a
shoreside
agent
of
the
spanish
line
in
new
york.
the
plaintiff
alleged
ownership,
operation,
management,
control,
and
used
all
the
verbiage
you
ordinarily
find
in
alleging
in
an
allegation
on
a
negligence
complaint
against
garcia.
on
the
hearing,
the
plaintiff
withdrew
the
allegation
of
ownership
but
did
refuse
to
withdraw
the
allegation
of
operation,
possibly
control.
there
was
an
allegation
that
garcia
was
the
employer
of
amaro,
the
petitioner,
that
was
withdrawn.
and
judge
sugarman
as
to
garcia
and
diaz
with
those
withdrawn
said,
“what
do
you
have
to
offer
against
garcia
and
diaz
as
to
management,
operation,
and
control
of
this
vessel
and
this
activity
which
was
going
on
this
day?”
i
said,
“they
had
proof
to
offer”
and
judge
sugarman
gave
him
every
opportunity
to
--
of
all
the
proof
they
wished.
they
put
in
the
agency
contract
into
evidence.
they
put
the
deposition
of
the
treasurer
of
garcia
and
diaz
into
the
evidence.
the
treasurer
of
garcia
and
diaz
was
called
in
as
a
live
witness
and
testified.
the
representative
of
garcia
and
diaz
had
appeared
which
the
guadalupe
was
docked,
was
called
and
he
testified.
and
at
the
end
of
the
--
these
all
his
testimony,
judge
sugarman
addressed
himself
to
the
plaintiff's
counsel
and
said,
“have
you
anything
more
whatever
to
offer
on
operation,
management
and
control?”
and
i
said,
“they
had
nothing
more
to
offer
and
that's
all
the
proof
they
had
on
that,”
and
judge
sugarman
in
that
proof
could
find
no
evidence
whatever,
operation,
management,
control
or
anything
to
do
with
the
vessel
other
than
as
a
shoreside
agent
by
garcia
and
diaz.
and
found
further,
no
proof
in
any
way
of
any
participation
in
this
operation
of
changing
the
angle
of
a
boom,
that
was
solely
and
only
what
was
going
on
this
day.
the
boom
hung
out
and
it
didn't
hang
out
far
enough
to
raise
a
draft
and
the
crew
were
changing
that
angle
to
let
the
boom
down
a
little
further
and
a
wire
somehow
slipped
off
this
man
and
brought
him
up
against
the
winch
which
severed
his
leg.
garcia
and
diaz
had
no
one
there,
no
one
near
the
scene
of
the
accident.
no
one
aboard
the
ship
and
judge
sugarman
found,
“nor
did
plaintiff
offered
any
proof
of
any
negligent
act
by
defendant
garcia,
within
the
scope
of
the
agency
contributing
to
his
injury.”
garcia
wasn't
there.
and
judge
sugarman
accordingly
had
to
dismiss
the
jones
act
claim
--
had
to
dismiss
the
jones
act
claim
against
garcia
because
the
plaintiff
had
conceded
the
man
was
not
employed
by
garcia,
he
had
first
alleged
to.
but
the
jones
act
can
only
apply
in
a
situation
where
you
have
an
employer-employee
relationship.
so
the
jones
act
cause
of
action
was
out
immediately
on
the
concession
that
employment
did
not
exist,
had
only
left
a
possible
general
maritime
law,
common
law
cause
of
action
for
negligence
against
garcia.
and
judge
sugarman
found
nothing
in
the
agency
agreement
and
nothing
in
the
facts
to
find
any
fault
or
liability
upon
garcia
and
i
say,
as
to
them,
to
garcia,
judge
sugarman
then
did
nothing
more
than
he
would
have
done
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
dismissed
cause
of
action
against
garcia.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
as
an
employee,
sir?
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
if
the
(inaudible)
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well,
on
pre-trial,
as
the
record
will
show,
judge
sugarman
on
the
pretrial,
not
only
dealt
with
the
motion
which
i
--
i
made,
and
all
the
defendants
made
for
a
hearing
on
these
defenses.
what
proceeded
to
as
is
done
continually
on
pretrial,
limit
the
issues,
if
possible.
and
he
said,
“do
you
claim,”
he
said
to
the
plaintiff,
“do
you
claim
employment
by
you,
the
plaintiff,
by
garcia
and
diaz?”
and
that
was,
“no”.
we
don't
--
no
longer
claim
that.
so
that
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
--
that
was
a
jones
act
result.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
we
come
to
general
maritime
law
and
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
there
was
an
issue
there,
he
should
not
be
tried
on
pretrial
without
testimony
and
proof.
but
here,
i
say,
we
have
this
single
difference
as
to
management,
operation,
and
control,
they
offered
all
the
proof
they
could
possibly
offer
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
management,
operation,
and
control.
now,
i
get
to
the
third
thing,
i
think
that
your
honor
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
no.
the
judge
should
not
try
it
on
a
pre-trial.
there's
no
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that's
what
he
did
here,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
well,
i
myself
--
i
myself,
and
i
will
agree
with
your
honor
--
your
honor
that
--
it's
a
question
of
negligence.
and
that,
i
think,
is
what
your
honor
has
in
mind.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that
relationship
--
some
relationship,
an
invitee
or
promisee
or
something.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
and
there's
some
relationship
on
the
general
admiralty
law
--
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
--
there's
an
employment.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
which
--
out
of
which
the
plaintiff
may
show
some
negligent
act
on
the
part
of
garcia
and
diaz.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that
is
properly
a
matter
of
trial.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
i'd
say,
your
honor,
it
could
be
right,
it
could
not
be
right.
mr.
john
l.
quinlan
from
all
the
knowledge
i
have
of
what
occurred
and
a
great
amount
but
outside
the
record,
i
say
it
is
right.
but
it
isn't
in
the
record
so
i
can't
say
to
your
honor,
it
is
right.
if
there
was
any
issue
of
negligence,
any
opportunity
on
part
of
this
plaintiff
approved
negligence
on
the
part
of
garcia
and
diaz,
that's
a
matter
of
a
trial,
it's
not
pretrial.
i
think
that's
what
your
honor
has
in
mind.
