mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i
would
like
to
let
you
know
what
the
facts
are
that
we
would
prove.
i
went
to
court
to
try
this
case.
counsel
--
the
judge
just
said
though
i
have
been
there
before
and
that
i
was
in
error
when
i
was
surprised,
but
i
was
not.
this
is
a
drawing
that
shows
the
outline
of
the
ship.
she
is
497
feet
long,
62.5
feet
beam.
this
is
the
winch
where
the
accident
occurred.
it
would
be
on
the
starboard
side.
along
side
on
the
right
of
the
ship
which
is
of
course
the
starboard
is
the
dock.
on
the
dock
were
two
trucks
loaded
with
big
long
planks
to
be
used
by
the
quin
lumber
company
in
installing
shifting
boards
for
the
return
departure
--
the
departure
next
day
of
the
ship.
there
were
for
grains.
now
i
have
this
drawing
made.
this,
you
are
looking
at
--
this
is
just
the
quarter
deck
which
are
shown
on
this
drawing
here.
this
is
a
bridge
of
the
forecastle
head
or
the
raised
deck
of
the
front
of
the
ship
giving
the
picture
of
that
drawing.
now
these
five
marks
or
spots
i
have
made.
this
was
a
(inaudible).
this
is
what
just
called
the
spool
of
the
ship
used
to
put
a
rope
around.
you
can
throw
it
around
the
end
and
take
several
turns
and
pull
it
tight
and
make
it
carry
the
load
up
or
you
can
reverse
this
direction
of
the
winch
and
hold
it
tight
and
let
it
down
then
you
may
lower
it.
this
would
represent
the
boom
here.
it
is
drawn
with
dashes
and
dots.
this
is
the
extra
wire
which
would
be
used.
the
bosuns
of
the
ship
were
here
and
they
started.
the
lumber
men
were
already
down
in
the
hold
and
number
two
had
the
collar
off,
i
suppose
observing
what
they
had
to
do
about
putting
these
planks
in.
over
here
was
the
winch
driver.
this
is
part
of
what
is
here
and
here
is
a
foot
lever
which
could
be
pushed
down
by
the
foot
of
the
bosun
or
by
the
winch
driver,
if
they
had
to
stop.
this
here
is
the
rung
of
the
cargo
winch.
this
wire
runs
through
those
blocks
at
the
foot
of
the
samson
post
and
at
the
top
of
the
samson
post
and
out
to
the
end
of
the
boom,
which
of
course
you
are
very
familiar
from
other
cases
where
these
accidents
have
happened.
the
fault
that
brings
these
american
companies
into
it,
the
stevedoring
people
who
were
aboard
and
the
quin
lumber
people,
all
of
whom
belonged
to
the
ila
they
call
it,
a
union,
the
foremen
or
(inaudible)
called
the
bosun
away.
he
was
the
superintendent.
this
winch
was
a
good
strong
winch.
there
were
no
defectiveness
that
we
know
of.
it
was
old
type.
it
was
built
in
denmark
about
two
years
or
about
the
time
the
ship
was
built.
strong
enough,
big
enough,
but
it
has
four
men
and
this
deck
here
which
the
spool
is
located
and
the
drawing
of
the
cargo
in
turn
in
the
same
direction
at
the
same
time.
there
are
no
gears
that
can
control
them
separately.
so
when
the
bosun
left
his
place
where
he
was
engaged
in
taking
the
slack
wire
that
came
from
a
cargo
pull
and
he
moved
from
there
on
request
of
the
outsider,
this
man
over
here
who
was
clearing
the
wire,
romero
was
holding
here.
this
wire
is
described
by
romero
as
very
old
and
worn
and
very
kinky
that
it
would
have
been
strange
and
its
threads
had
been
impaired
so
it
did
not
evenly
hold
itself
and
would
twist.
and
when
this
man
left
and
this
man
jumped
over
here
to
take
the
cargo
pull
without
any
orders
from
anybody,
the
winch
driver
did
not
stop
the
winch.
it
kept
it
going
and
another
wire
came
up
here
and
hit
the
spool
which
caused
it
to
lose
its
traction
in
spite
of
romero's
efforts
and
the
boom
fell.
he
tried
to
get
out
of
the
way,
but
his
leg
was
carried
in
these
two
steel
blocks
here.
they
are
shown
at
close
abbreviation,
this
point.
this
is
a
(inaudible)
in
the
deck
that
holds
the
lower
one
of
those
blocks.
this
distance
would
be
up
as
the
boom
would
go
down
the
toping
lift
would
go
up
on
the
boom.
so
you
can
see
that
if
this
bosun,
the
spanish
line
were
let
out
of
this
case
on
the
ground
that
some
ground
that
we
would
not
go
into
and
the
men
were
relegated
to
a
suit
against
the
american
companies.
when
the
case
was
tried
the
lawyer
for
the
american
companies
would
have
to
say,
well,
the
real
cause
of
this
accident
was
the
un-seaworthiness
of
the
ship,
because
the
wire
was
worn
out.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
--
back
towards
the
reach
of
this
modern
steamer.
now,
i
want
to
discuss
the
law.
it
was
just
50
years
ago
that
i
first
met
andrew
furuseth
who
designed
the
lafollette's
seamen's
act.
i
was
a
clerk
in
the
office
of
the
seamen's
branch
of
the
legal
aid
society.
continued
there
for
8
years,
and
eventually
i
became
officially
counselor
for
mr.
furuseth's
union
called
the
international
seamen's
union
of
america.
the
first
edition
of
the
seamen's
act
was
not
signed
by
president
taft
because
it
affected
foreign
ships,
and
there
was
so
much
protest
from
foreign
governments
who
didn't
want
any
changes
made.
the
titanic
disaster
happened
april
15th,
i
remember
it
distinctly;
2000
people
nearly
drowned,
more
than
half
of
the
people
on
the
ship,
the
ship
and
though
advertised
is
the
safest
thing
ever
built,
had
life
preservers
and
rafts
enough
for
only,
40%
of
the
people
on
board.
so
we
seized
that
opportunity
to
frame
up
a
safety
law
that
would
apply
to
all
foreign
ships
as
well
as
american
in
carrying
of
passengers.
the
jones
act,
section
20
was
my
idea,
that
is
the,
to
try
to
modify
the
fellow
servant
rule.
you
would
laugh
if
i
read
to
you
from
our
old
brief
in
the
chelantis
case.
we
argued
that
the
case
was
governed
by
the
common
law,
not
by
the
maritime
law.
the
source
to
that
idea
was
the
osceola
case
which
court
had
said
formally
that
fellow
servant
rule
is
a
defense
and
our
lawyers
and
judges
all
believe
it.
then
came
the
great
decision
of
justice
mcreynolds
for
this
court.
when
we
went
back
to
the
(inaudible)
1774
and
discovered
that
it
had
been
effectively
and
intelligently
stated
then,
we
have
a
general
maritime
law
of
our
own.
and
thus
the
compensation
act
which
we
since
learned
were
originated
by
mr.
marks,
adopted
by
people
everywhere
to
overcome
the
terrible
defenses
of
the
common
law,
the
assumption
of
risk
doctrine
and
contributory
negligence
which
defeated
so
many
claims.
he
said
that
the
compensation
act
of
maryland,
and
new
york
were
varied
the
uniformity
of
the
maritime
law,
and
so
of
course
the
seaman
and
the
longshoreman
were
relegated
to
the
maritime
law.
the
thing
came
to
a
head
with
me
in
the
bird
case
in
philadelphia.
i
was
on
trial
1919.
i
had
been
to
sea
that
summer.
the
court
was
seriously
considering
for
several
months,
the
circuit
court,
whether
the
judiciary
act
of
1331
really
saved
any
remedy
for
seamen
of
a
trial
by
jury.
some
of
our
district
judges
of
that
age,
of
that
date
who
have
died
long
since,
were
quite
reactionary
and
hard,
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
what
i
as
a
lawyer
of
the
legal
aid
society
considered
justice.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
no,
i
have
adopted
his
decision
as
a
very
divine
thing,
because
he
has
laid
the
groundwork
for
word
of
law,
adopting
the
ancient
maritime
law,
modifying
it
as
we
can.
it's
what
we
say
it
is,
all
foreign
ships
entering
here
are
subject
to
it.
if
they
don't
like
it,
they
can
stay
out.
that
was
the
argument
that
brought
the
great
justice
sutherland
into
this
thing
in
1919-20,
the
decision
in
the
dillon-strathearn
case.
within
37
days
after
the
decision
in
that
case,
senator
jones
pushes
through
this
jones
act
that
contained
about
100
or
more
amendments
of
the
maritime
law,
three
relating
to
seamen;
one
of
them
the
provision
that
changed
the
(inaudible),
the
courts
have
found
that
it
was
not
effective
and
we
have
modified
it,
senator
jones
and
mr.
furuseth
(inaudible)
in
office,
it
was
senator
sutherland,
he'd
only
a
--
well,
it
was
just
like
next
week
to
see
him.
they
had
taken
the
act
and
amended
it
to
read
that
the
seamen
were
entitled
to
half
the
wages
earned
and
unpaid,
because
under
the
articles
where
we'd
provide
it
in
the
original
bill,
they
should
get
half
the
wages
due
them.
the
court
concluded
that
there
wasn't
anything
due
them
because
their
contract
said
that
there
wasn't
anything
due
them.
we
got
john
w.
davidson
to
help
us
in
the
jackson-archimedes
case
that
he
was
not
successful.
they
held
that
even
those
advances
made
in
foreign
ports
were
valid,
even
though
our
act
said
in
anticipation
that
it
could
not
be
considered
in
figuring
accountable
wages
of
the
seamen
here.
i
speak
to
you
intimately
of
this
thing
because
it's
been
my
life.
i
have
carried
on
so
far
as
i
was
able,
the
work
of
andrew
furuseth
or
tried
to.
it's
the
greatest
example
of
this
country's
development
that
i
know.
this
humble
man
from
norway,
educating
himself,
coming
here
conceiving,
that
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
it
was
illegal
to
have
men
arrested
for
quitting
their
jobs,
carrying
a
thing
through
as
he
did
in
1897
to
the
supreme
court
in
which
justice
holland
dissented
and
mr.
douglas
pointed
out
in
1898,
the
white
act,
destroyed,
arrest
for
desertion
for
american
seamen
on
american
ships,
but
we
wanted
it
to
apply
to
the
foreign
seamen
on
the
foreign
ships
and
we
devised
and
amended
the
act
in
every
way
we
could
think
of
to
extend
it
to
foreign
ships,
to
give
them
freedom
too,
so
that
their
visit
to
the
shores
of
america
meant
a
better
freedom
to
anybody
and
everybody.
where
we
went
back,
we
went
in
the
southern
building,
furuseth
and
i,
and
senator
sutherland
to
the
office
of
senator
jones.
you
won't
find
any
hearings
on
this
section
33
of
the
jones
act,
why?
because
i
had
argued
the
abdu
nigretia
case
before
the
supreme
court
reported
247
u.s.
27,
and
lost
it
on
the
ground
that
we
had
not
in
saying
that
courts
in
united
states
are
open
to
seamen
included
the
words,
including
the
appellate
court
and
this
court
under
in
a
established
rule
held
that
the
act
did
not
benefit
the
hindus
who
demanded
half
wages
in
brooklyn
unless
they
are
shipped.
well,
senator
jones
remedied
that,
give
me
your
amendment
boy.
he
was
about
6
feet
6,
black-haired,
ex-methodist
minister
from
state
of
washington,
(inaudible)
he
says
none
of
the
congress,
none
of
the
senators
won't
go
home
at
government
expanse
until
this
bill
is
signed,
and
he
tacked
it
on
the
civil
sundry
appropriation
act
and
you
find,
the
decision
was
april
21st
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
amendment
was
july
1st
at
the
same
year,
phenomenal,
wasn't
it?
now,
i'll
natural
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
to
mr.
jones
about
our
amendment
in
the
jones
act.
senator
reynolds
had
--
mcreynolds
judge
mcreynolds,
i
think
a
great
decision
i
say
this
more
sincerely.
i
was
so
ignorant
of
the
history
of
our
maritime
law
and
i
began
that
it
wasn't
funny.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
the
chelantis
case.
that's
where
he
implied
what
he'd
already
said
in
southern
paciﬁc
against
jensen
and
we
discussed
the
question
of
the
jury
trial
on
account
of
the
threat
of
an
appeal
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
bird
case
and
what
i've
seen
happened
in
the
chelantis
case,
i
said
i'm
going
to
write
this
thing
and
a
seaman
may
elect,
write
an
argument
about
that,
senator
sutherland
said
that
it
isn't
necessary,
constitution's
got
a
right,
don't
have
to
have
it.
i
insisted.
they
let
me
have
my
way
and
the
rest
of
the
act
was
written
by
senator
sutherland,
making
a
railway
act
applicable
to
seamen
by
reference.
well
i've
tried
five
time
before
this
to
get
here.
(inaudible),
hogan
against
the
hamburg-american
line,
holler
case,
one
of
them
–
judge
learned
hand
in
his
taylor
against
atlantic
maritime
which
was
reversed
by
this
court,
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson,
he,
when
the
case,
the
jones
act
came
before
in
the
1924
on
a
motion
made
by
vernon
jones
of
the
big
firm
of
kirlan,
campbell
&
keating,
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
said
i
think
it's
ridiculous
to
argue
that
congress
intended
this
act
to
apply
only
to
american
seamen,
why
it
would
american
shipping
at
such
a
disadvantage?
they
settled
the
case,
never
went
any
further.
in
the
paula
case
justice
learned
hand
sat
and
my
brief
was
simply
a
restatement
of
his
decision
in
stewart
against
the
pacific
mail
steamship
company
and
his
answer
was,
well
i
was
just
a
district
judge
then.
that
made
any
difference
in
the
law.
he
didn't
say
a
word
about
it
in
his
decision,
taylor
against
atlantic
maritime,
not
a
word.
in
the
taylor
case
he
adapted
a
compromise.
he
along
with
a
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
in
paula
had
said
we
think
that
we
couldn't
apply
this
law
to
foreign
ships
unless
congress
makes
it
more
clear
that
that
was
the
intention.
i
say
to
you
that
if
the
defendants
here
want
relief
from
the
jones
act,
they
must
apply
to
congress
to
get
it.
in
the
absence
of
treaties,
they
are
governed.
what
is
the
source
of
it?
harden
against
gardner,
could
you
read
those
all
cases
read
against
(inaudible).
he
opened
the
doors
of
american
courts
to
all
seamen
and
they
were
seamen
from
all
country
then
just
as
same
as
the
reynolds.
and
after
that
for
50,
60
years
these
foreign
governments
to
home
or
here
now
started
writing
treaties,
commerce
and
friendship
they
called
them,
and
article
23
and
24
related
to
control
of
the
crewmen
who
are
visiting
our
ports
that
those
matters
internal
regime
with
the
ship
including
torts,
injuries,
neglected
treats
would
it
be
governed
by
the
law
over
the
flag
of
the
ship?
when
we
stripped
that
away,
i
wrote
that
provision
too
in
the
seamen's
act,
section
16,
i
think
mr.
furuseth
is
set
to
talk
about
that.
i
knew
enough
about
the
constitution,
i
know
that
there
is
provision
that
said
that
the
treaties
are
the
highest
law
of
the
land.
so
we
directed
the
president
to
abrogate
those
treaties.
mr.
taft
wouldn't
sign
the
bill,
but
woodrow
wilson
signed
the
bill.
judge
denman,
former
head
of
the
shipping
board,
honored
circuit
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
oldest
living
judge
i
guess
in
the
federal
judge
sitting
today,
was
counseled
to
the
ship
honoring
crowd
in
their
dealings
and
knew
furuseth
and
woodrow
wilson
happened
to
ask
him,
mr.
denman
what
shall
i
do
without
this
thing?
he
says,
sign
it.
a
letter
from
denman
and
then
the
rest
by
him
is
in
this
little
book,
that
i've
taken
the
privilege
of
putting
in
the
library
of
this
court.
you
find
on
page
222,
a
picture
of
the
seaman
and
the
senators
and
the
congressman
and
the
seamen's
act
and
woodrow
wilson
at
the
top
and
here
in
the
third
line
is
judge
sutherland,
read
the
citations
quoting
from
his
findings
and
senator
jones
on
this
very
law,
read
the
decision
of
judge
sutherland
in
o'hara
against
luckenbach,
where
the
ship
owners
had
disregarded
the
provision
that
required
that
the
crew
be
divided
in
the
equal
watches
and
that
caused
several
disasters,
(inaudible)
one
of
them,
(inaudible)
didn't
--
wasn't
prevented
by
judge
sutherland's
decision,
but
this
great
lawyer
designed
this
jones
act
and
it
was
his
considered
judgment
and
i
heard
in
the
discussion
with
senator
jones
that
the
amendment
of
the
law
giving
the
seamen
election
any
seaman
election
gave
the
individual
the
choice,
he
could
invoke
jurisdiction
of
a
court.
that's
what
america
is
for,
that's
our
trouble
to
be.
then
(inaudible)
has
saved
us
from
discretion
of
sputnik
business.
he
came
from
germany.
so
he
said
was
the
first
american
to
learn
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
in
conflict
with
a
provision
to
the
seamen's
act
that
permitted
the
man
to
be
sent
to
jail
for
refusing
to
work,
the
very
essence
of
our
freedom,
isn't
it?
it
took
a
foreigner
to
do
that
and
no
reason,
a
poor
man,
self-educated
person,
man
of
the
greatest
culture
and
aesthetic,
who
said
a
labor
union
leader
could
be
youthful
should
have
nothing
in
his
own
and
want
nothing
for
himself.
i
spent
30
years
with
that
old
man,
always
at
the
capital
hotel
before
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
the
case
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
abdu
case,
i
don't
know,
six
different
chief
justices
who
sat
on
cases
i'd
had
the
opportunity
to
come
here
in.
this
isn't
a
great,
great
experience.
any
lawyer
who
had
the
ability
training,
a
lawyer
ought
to
have
would
have
done
better
than
i
have
done.
all
i
have
had
to
contribute
was
persistence,
not
too
much
intelligence,
but
i
have
learned
with
andrew
furuseth
that
to
work
is
to
worship
and
to
labor
is
to
pray
and
in
my
labors
i
pray
that
god
will
tell
you
how
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
may
i
--
may
i
stand
here
instead
of
there?
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i'll
--
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i
--
i
want
to
show
you
a
picture
here
at
page
229.
this
is
a
picture
that
some
of
you
might
have
seen
in
one
of
the
old
union
halls.
these
are
the
members
of
the
house
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
who
walked
through
the
(inaudible),
number
one
and
number
two.
here
are
members
of
the
senate
and
the
one
at
the
right
is
no
other
than
george
sutherland
who
is
our
lawyer.
i
don't
think
he
got
paid
very
much,
but
he
briefed
and
argued
this
(inaudible)
case.
now,
i
had,
as
i
told
you
in
the
last
argument,
tried
to
argue
a
couple
of
cases
down
here
and
lost
them
both.
one
of
the
question
of
the
opening
the
courts
to
seamen
about
repayment
of
fees
and
justice
white
and
chief
justice
went
back
and
found
some
case
40
years
old
in
which
the
railroad
company
has
successfully
defeated
the
similar
case.
so,
we
had
to
go
back
to
senator
jones
and
ask
for
an
amendment
and
i
remember
all
it
needed
was
including
appellate
court
and
i
could
write
that
much.
and
he
pasted
it
there
on
the
civil
sundry
appropriation
act
as
the
amendment
and
it
had
the
phenomenal
record
of
amending
the
supreme
court's
decision
within
30
days,
the
act
of
congress
was
passed
and
the
president
signed
it,
probably
of
that
one.
the
chelentis
case
however
as
you
recall,
the
great
lawyer,
justice
mcreynolds,
he
is
a
great
lawyer
and
he
was
a
great
lawyer,
unearthed
this
doctrine
of
the
uniformity
of
the
maritime
law
and
it's
basis
is
on
contract
both
as
to
seaworthiness
and
maintenance
and
cure
and
we
were
left
without
anything.
now,
what
i
had
tried
to
do
in
that
--
what
i'm
trying
to
do,
if
you
read
the
(inaudible),
you
might
read
that
part
of
it's
--
it's
in
the
chelentis
case.
chelentis
is
cited
in
our
brief.
what
i
try
to
do
is
do
what
everybody
said
was
the
most
we
could
hope
to
do,
modify
in
part
the
application
of
the
fellow
servant
doctrine.
we
now
know
from
the
statistics
that
probably
80%
of
the
accidents
that
occur
in
the
industry
are
due
to
negligent
acts
of
co-servants.
so
we
designed
this
thing,
section
20,
in
any
suit
to
recover
damages
for
any
injury
sustained
on
board
vessel
or
in
its
service
seamen
having
command
shall
not
be
held
to
be
fellow
servants
to
those
under
their
authority.
well,
question
in
making
repairs
is
that
master
job
anyhow
or
mates
making
a
ship
in
sea-worthy
condition.
fellow
servant
rule
couldn't
bar
that
so
we
weren't
getting
much,
but
we
didn't
get
that
much.
so
we
had
to
seek
an
amendment
and
we
waited
until
--
oh,
yes
then
when
i
said
that
(inaudible)
said,
“get
a
good
lawyer.”
and
they
got
one,
george
sutherland.
he
was
later
partner
with
wade
ellis,
former
solicitor
general
i
think
had
been
identified
with
the
government
in
ohio,
cincinnati.
mr.
ellis
--
wade
ellis,
his
brother
channing
worked
hard
to
write
the
brief
in
the
panama-johnson
case
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
the
seamen's
act
is
of
the
--
seamen's
act
of
--
of
the
jones
act
is
upheld
as
of
1924.
but
george
sutherland
wrote
this
section
20
we
hear
so
much
about,
i
never
follow
all
and
had
so
many
cases
written
about
it.
i
guess
you'll
all
agree
to
that.
we
didn't
intend
to
create
any
separate
forum.
we
were
trying
to
amend
the
substantive
maritime
law
of
the
sea
as
justice
--
what
was
his
name,
i
wrote
it
in
the
--
the
supreme
court
said
--
they
added
fortuitously
for
us
now
that
this
act
of
congress
is
an
amendment
of
the
general
maritime
law
and
extends
territorially
as
far
as
congress
can
make
it
go.
we
were
dealing
with
the
case
of
the
fellow
named
jacob
something
who
fell
--
johnson,
who
fell
off
a
ladder
of
a
panama
railroad
steamer
coming
out
of
the
canal
headed
for
new
york.
at
any
rate,
the
contents
with
judge
senator
jones'
brief,
“i've
been
there
before.
alone.
i
didn't
have
(inaudible)
with
me.
didn't
need
to
in
those
days.”
senator
jones,
the
great
big
tall
man,
six
feet
six,
black
hair,
ex-methodist
minister
from
the
state
of
washington
is
rather
definite
in
his
ideas.
well,
george
sutherland
went
along
that
afternoon,
i
had
an
amendment
that
probably
is
awkward
as
it
was
in
--
that's
knocked
out
in
the
chelentis
case
and
the
left
handed.
it's
a
good
thing
he
did
with
andy.
and
he
said,
“i
think
the
railway
service
tax
can
be
upheld
by
reference
here.”
that's
the
way
to
get
around
your
fellow
servant
rule,
you'll
get
--
they'll
have
no
defense,
not
only
that,
they'll
be
responsible
for
the
negligence
of
the
co-service
and
that
will
via
the
safety
law
of
the
seamen.
so,
i
had
an
idea,
well
we
ought
to
put
foreign
seamen
in
there,
we
ought
to
have
a
jury
trial.
they
settled
finally
that
we
didn't
need
the
foreign
seamen
stuff
if
you
amend
that
laws
of
the
forum
in
the
absence
of
treaties
to
the
contrary
all
ships
and
things
that
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sovereign
are
bound
by
that
law.
what
with
--
the
analogy
to
the
(inaudible)
case
is
very
clear,
the
british
ores
--
80%
of
our
trade
was
in
british
flag
traps.
they
said,
“we
contracted
these
seamen
that
permit
them
to
have
no
wages
except
that
the
option
of
the
master
are
valuable
to
us.
they'll
be
leaving
their
ships
everywhere,
we
can
hold
them
until
they
get
back
to
their
arrogant
best
for
three
years
and
then
pay
them
what
we
amount
to
if
we
want
to.”
we
didn't
want
that,
we
were
building
$15,
$20
million
with
or
without
--
a
billion
dollars
with
ships.
we
needed
seamen.
we
dug
up
the
records
of
1812
and
before
that,
when
they
impressed
america
seamen
into
british
ships.
all
it
did
the
least,
we
can
do
and
give
them
half
wages
and
the
right
to
break
their
contracts
here,
open
the
court
of
the
united
states
to
them
where
they
have
the
few
payment
of
fees
and
cost.
they
did
it.
we
had
the
great
decision
of
marshall
in
the
exchange
pursuant
applied
recently
in
the
gerard
case,
in
the
absence
of
treaty,
mr.
gerard
the
soldier
who
shot
a
japanese
one
negligently
in
japan,
had
to
be
tried
by
the
laws
of
the
place
where
it
happened.
but,
if
there'd
been
a
treaty,
he
could
have
with
his
other
people
and
relatives
and
friends
who
stirred
up
such
a
must
out
there
somewhere
in
the
middle
west
have
insisted
upon
the
man
being
tried
in
new
york
or
indiana
or
wherever
it
was
by
his
peers.
you
decided
that
case
correctly,
i
see
the
time
is
4:37.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
--
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
oh
--
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i
heard
about
that,
i
read
about
it.
(laughter)
i
read
--
i
didn't
know
about
it.
well
–
let
me
read.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
thank
you.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
if
the
court
please.
i
want
to
refer
to
the
brief
of
the
respondent
called
skibsfartens
arbeidsgiverforening,
norwegian
shipping
federation,
page
18
of
that
brief.
mr.
watson
who,
i
believe,
wrote
the
brief
with
mr.
estabrook
as
referred
to
report
of
the
merchant
marine
and
fisheries
committee
of
the
house
not
as
to
this
bill
but
after
the
bill
that
was
before
the
congress
three
years
before.
fortunately,
i
--
and
this
is
with
the
help
of
my
associate,
mr.
ellis,
who's
been
before
this
court
many
times
before,
and
we
searched
our
congressional
library
and
records
and
found
the
record,
66th
congress,
three
years,
late
years,
2nd
session,
page
7037.
mr.
king,
the
presiding
senator,
“does
the
senator
say
that
the
supreme
court
has
held
we
have
jurisdiction
over
foreign
seamen
and
foreign
ships?”
mr.
jones
of
washington,
“under
the
present
statute,
we
have
such
jurisdiction
in
our
courts.
the
supreme
court
held
the
act
to
be
constitutional
only
sometime
ago.”
mr.
king
--
now,
this
is
the
date.
it
was
may
14th,
1920,
three
weeks
before
this
act
would
pass
congress.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
three
weeks.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i'm
reading
from
a
congressional
record
of
may
--
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
--
14th,
1920.
the
act
was
passed
june
5th,
1920.
this
was
the
debate
on
this
amendment
just
before
it
passed.
i
will
skip
over
to
page
7043
of
that
record,
the
bottom
on
the
right-hand
side.
mr.
king,
“i
should
like
to
ask
the
senator,
having
this
bill
in
charge,
what
is
the
necessity
now
of
reenacting
legislation
dealing
with
this
subject?”
mr.
jones
of
washington,
chairman
of
the
committee
on
commerce
who
prepared
the
bill,
“i
will
call
the
senate
to
their
attention
to
the
only
change
made
in
the
law
by
this
provision.”
you
will
note
on
page
51
and
lines
5
and
6
the
words,
“the
payment
of
such
advanced
wages
or
allotment.
here
is
the
change
in
the
existing
law
whether
made
within
or
without
the
united
states
or
a
territory
subject
to
jurisdiction
thereof.”
then,
mr.
jones
said
this,
his
own
language,
“the
supreme
court
has
upheld
this
section
and
has
also
upheld
the
right
of
congress
to
deal
with
foreign
seamen
in
our
ports.”
we
suggest
that,
of
course,
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
when
they
said,
“any
seamen
may
elect”.
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
it
in
that
maryland
case.
the
--
the
seaman
may
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
in
his
interest.
that's
part
of
america,
to
give
people
equal
opportunity
here.
our
old
seamen's
act
was
intended
to
benefit
the
world
why
we
pursued
our
effort
to
the
amendment,
that's
referred
to
in
these
pages.
i
shan't
read
them
now,
to
the
extension
of
the
crimping
law.
i
don't
really
know
what
crimping
is
but
in
those
days,
you
go
back
to
the
period
of
british
history
and
its
industries,
which
you've
read,
of
course.
the
seamen
were
indentured
to
the
ship
by
long
articles.
and
to
get
the
jobs,
improvident
as
they
always
have
been,
then,
they
needed
money.
they
would
sign
on
conditioned
payments,
wages
due
later.
they'd
sign
away
from
one
to
six
months
wages.
the
wages
were
miserably
small
but
we
tried
to
stop
that
in
1915
by
making
those
advances
illegal
even
made
it
in
holland
or
germany
or
england.
i
got
john
w.
davis
to
argue
the
case.
you'll
find
it
in
the
archimedes.
it's
referred
to
here
i
think,
but
we
lost
it.
the
court
concluded
that
that's
completed
transaction,
i
suppose,
like
a
note
pay
abroad.
we
couldn't
go
that
far.
but
it
shows
you
how
far
congress
wanted
to
go.
as
it's
--
it's
always
seemed
to
be
ridiculous
to
me
that
anybody
should
question
that
the
jones
act
applied
within
our
own
jurisdiction
on
page
7044.
the
amendment
itself
is
passed.
it's
called
section
636
there.
it
really
was
section
33
as
we
have
it
in
our
books
now.
at
section
20
of
this
act
of
march
4th,
1915
be
in
hereby
as
amended
to
read
as
follows,
“that
any
seaman
who
shall
suffer
personal
injury
in
the
course
of
his
employment
may,
at
his
election,
maintain
an
action
for
damages
at
law.”
those
were
guide
rules.
i
wanted
the
--
all
the
seamen
to
have
the
right
to
our
courts.
and
they
opened
the
courts
to
seamen
without
the
prepayment
of
fees
or
cost
because
we
have
thousands
of
petitions
in
which
the
seaman
said,
“i
have
nothing.
i
owe
nothing,”
and
so
forth,
and
his
lawyer
had
to
sign
a
paper
that
he
wasn't
going
to
get
any
fee,
at
least
not
more
than
10%,
which
meant
defeat
of
his
rights.
the
purpose
of
the
act
itself,
the
jones
act
now,
they've
had
about
35
or
40
different
provisions
of
which
this
one,
33,
amendment
of
section
20
was
the
one
we're
talking
about.
the
enactment
says,
“be
it
enacted
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
national
defense
and
for
proper
growth
of
its
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
of
the
united
states
shall
have
a
merchant
marine
and
the
best
equipped
and
most
suitable
types
of
vessels
sufficient
to
carry
the
great
portion
--
greater
portion
of
its
commerce
and
serve
as
a
naval
and
--
or
military
auxiliary
in
time
of
war
or
national
emergency,
ultimately,
it
will
be
owned
and
operated
privately
by
citizens
of
the
united
states.”
i
can
hardly
resist
the
temptation
to
say,
call
your
attention
to
the
--
the
manifesto.
we
have
called
it
(inaudible)
answering
linen
that
the
seamen
are
needed
to
man
our
ships.
the
nation
that
gave
you
freedom
needs
your
help
and
our
ships
were
manned,
not
only
foreign
seamen
who
deserted
their
ships
to
--
to
join
ours
with
better
wages
and
free
conditions
but
our
own
seaman
who'd
been
to
sea,
went
to
sea
again.
now,
next
in
importance
is
the
brief
--
is
this
the
solicitor
general
--
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states,
mr.
(inaudible),
mr.
james
m.
beck
was
interested.you
find
this
quoted
from
their
brief,
the
government's
brief
in
1918,
wasn't
it?
1918.
the
recordings
from
mr.
harding
--
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i
don't
believe
we
do
but
i
have
to
tell
you
this,
judge.
here
is
the
picture
of
harding,
congressman
harding,
one
of
those
fighting
for
the
seamen's
act
in
congress
along
with
george
sutherland.
we
are
trying
to
build
up
an
american
merchant
marine.
if
you
do
not
have
rules
that
restrict
competitors
of
american
merchant
marines
to
the
full
extent
and
just
as
you
restrict
the
american
merchant
marine,
you
never
can
have
an
american
merchant
marine.
why,
senator
kern,
i
don't
know
if
he
was
republican
or
democrat,
from
indiana,
great
nobleman
who
fought
through
this
thing.
he
said,
“we
want
to
save
some
of
this
to
the
extent
of
subsidy.
we
want
our
competitors
to
pay
as
much
to
their
seamen,
as
we
do.”
our
immigration
department
allowed
us
90
days
and
for
their
foreign
seamen
reship.
today,
they
have
to
report
every
29
days
to
the
immigration
department.
(inaudible)
than
eisenhower
took
the
thing
in
hand.
the
ellis
island
was
a
prison.
we
were
advocating
freedom
for
americans
and
everybody
in
the
world
and
lucky
enough
to
save
us,
who
couldn't
get
a
job
within
29
days.
i
think
that
one
of
these
lawyers
in
court
represented
the
ship
foreign
occasion
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
deported
it
while
it
was
in
the
court,
an
action
was
pending.
i
think
i
brought
the
thing
before
mr.
justice
harlan.
at
any
rate,
this
book
here,
this
thing,
this
picture,
four
men,
bradley,
hanson,
and
two
others
were
imprisoned
to
test
this
constitutional
question.
that
was
where
if
you
get
into
this
subject
halftime
to
read
the
decision
of
the
great
dissenter,
john
marshall
harlan,
you'll
see
--
as
i
think
justice
douglas
in
his
book
refers
to
the
next
step
to
make
imprisonment
of
seamen
on
american
ships
invalid,
and
the
act
to
--
i
guess
the
white
act
late
in
1898.
well
then,
of
course,
our
seamen's
act
after
the
white
act
in
1898,
making
imprisonment
illegal
on
our
ships.
of
course,
we
wanted
to
carry
it
through
the
world.
what
better
way
have
we
today
to
carry
the
american
system
of
law
and
justice
to
the
world
that
needs
it,
that
may
save
the
world,
than
the
right
of
trial
by
a
jury?
we're
bringing
the
magna
carta
right
out,
aren't
we?
we're
letting
them
share
and
these
respondents
to
be
heard,
to
ask,
that
the
hands
of
progress
be
set
back
that
this
great
court
which
has
had
the
courage,
the
greatest
courage
shown
by
any
court
on
this
question
of
integration.
it
had
to
come.
you
did
your
duty.
you
must
do
it
now.
this
seaman
maimed
and
injured
at
the
dock.
he
elected,
while
in
the
hospital
bleeding
and
wounded,
to
have
his
rights
enforced
here.
how
could
they
dare
to
suggest
that
the
quin
lumber
company
and
the
stevedoring
company
who
spent
four
years
considered
this
as
an
accident?
one
of
them
took
the
foreman
away,
the
(inaudible)
took
him
off
the
winch.
they
had
four
men
to
run
it.
they
had
three
then.
there
was
nobody
to
clear
the
wire.
the
wire
was
old
and
kinky.
if
it's
been
a
new
wire,
maybe
it
wouldn't
have
happened.
how
can
anybody
but
the
jury
or
the
court
decide
who's
responsible?
you're
going
to
send
this
man
to
spain,
to
franco?
mr.
franco,
of
course,
knows
which
way
he
wants
this
case
decided.
i
think
i
will
close
--
oh,
judge
sutherland,
according
to
judge
sutherland's
brief.
judge
sutherland
wrote
a
brief
probably,
the
good
lord
directed
this.
we
had
sense
enough
to
get
in
george
sutherland.
now,
where
could
i
find
that
in
my
brief?
now,
this
is
from
our
old
record
as
to
my
office.
10
--
page
10
of
sutherland's
brief.
he
wrote
it
himself.
he
says
not
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
context
to
indicate
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
the
use
of
the
word
“seamen”
to
exclude
foreign
seamen.
a
thing
which,
as
we
have
seen,
must
exist
to
justify
the
court
in
restricting
the
otherwise
broad
application
of
term
but
the
context
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
language
of
the
provision
already
discussed
is
followed
by
the
words
and
of
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
be
open
to
such
seamen's
work
enforcements.
obviously
if
the
provision
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
american
seamen
--
and
that's
in
black
type,
seamen
there
could
be
no
purpose.
there
could
be
no
purpose
in
this
last
quoted
provision.
the
courts
of
the
united
states
were
already
invisibly
open
in
such
cases.
mr.
ellis
in
his
research
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
had
two
--
two
arguments
to
that
dillon-strathearn
case
here.
the
first
one
there's
something
wrong
with
the
record.
i
had
carried
the
thing
up
in
conjunction
with
a
lawyer
named
waguespack
from
new
orleans.
the
whole
union
and
(inaudible)
were
not
organized
for
law
enforcement
but
he
turned
to
the
law.
he
hated
this
new
socialism.
he
was
verging
out.
this
little
book
“rights
and
duties
of
merchant
seamen”,
i'm
going
to
ask
permission
to
leave
it
with
you
with
these
larger
reproductions
of
the
congressional
records.
this
little
book
i
got
out
i
suppose
i
was
on
seven
years
at
the
bar
or
so.
i
certainly
didn't
know
much
and
it's
very
crude,
i
hope
you
won't
read
any
except
this
paragraph
i'm
[laughs]
going
to
read
to
you
but
i
started
[laughs]
it
this
way.
now,
this
was
after
i'd
seen
the
manifesto,
world
revolution
by
lenin
coming
on
our
ships
from
archangel
and
odessa
were
cargos
we
obtained
through
russia.
they
wanted
world
revolution.
i
didn't
know
much
about
karl
marx.
i
didn't
know
about
his
friends
and
he
lets
out,
invented
compensation
and
put
it
as
his
human
rights
style
maybe
in
1878.
i
didn't
learn
that
from
1950.
i
find
that
compensation
is
a
part
of
communism,
a
part
of
the
state
control
which
the
individual
has
nothing
but
an
add-on
and
it
has
no
power.
the
law
of
the
flag
though.
the
writer,
this
is
part
1,
rights
and
duties
of
merchant
seamen.
the
writer
is
presenting
this
small
volume.
he's
trying
to
answer
what
he
believed
to
be
a
real
need
for
short
and
concise
statement
of
the
maritime
law
relative
to
seamen
and
officers
on
vessels
of
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries
and
the
law
of
the
flag.
generally
speaking,
the
law
of
the
flag
determines
the
rights
of
individuals
on
board.
however,
there
is
a
general
maritime
law
the
principles
of
which
largely
governed
all
ships
engaged
in
international
commerce.
when
a
vessel
is
in
a
port
of
another
nation,
it
--
it
and
the
crew
are
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
country
in
which
they
are
located
unless
by
treaty
it
is
otherwise
agreed.
now
where
is
that
treaty?
that
treaty
i
had
it
here.
here
it
is,
the
treaty.
i
saw
plenty
of
them.
turning
to
legal
age
society
going
to
the
court
trying
to
represent
some
foreign
seaman
on
a
foreign
ship
confronted
with
a
treaty
turn
to
page
38,
article
38
and
39,
you'll
find
the
provisions
as
such.
that
the
court
couldn't
take
jurisdiction
with
the
slightest
protest
on
the
contrary.
we
abrogated
those
treaties.
the
president
did
it
within
a
year
in
accepting
in
every
country
except
sweden
which
their
treaty
had
been
reinstated
in
1910.
so,
it
couldn't
be
abrogated
in
1911,
1921
--
1921,
6
years.
now,
we
expected,
of
course,
those
seamen
who
wanted
to
have
their
rights
here,
could
and
would
avail
themselves
but
comes
the
decision
of
lauritzen
v.
larsen
and
all
these
boys
from
new
york
representing
the
tenants
have
been
terribly
elated
and
the
judge
has
been
persuaded
that
this
court
frowned
upon
the
idea
of
giving
a
foreign
seaman
a
right
and
the
court
to
enforce
its
rights
in
but
it
didn't.
anybody
will
read
the
decision
of
judge
jackson
in
that
case.
all
those
who
criticized
will
say
it's
too
long.
he
discussed
a
lot
of
things
that
weren't
pertinent
to
the
decision
he
did.
but
the
decision
doesn't
hold
what
they
contend
at
all.
all
it
says
is
-
is
what
you'll
find
in
the
first
paragraph
in
my
little
book.
in
the
absence
of
treaties,
the
law
of
the
flag
apply
on
the
high
seas
if
the
case
is
tried
in
the
forum
of
the
flag.
i
think
you
would
conclude
if
you
stated
the
decision
of
judge
mcreynolds
who
undoubtedly
read
many
of
these
decisions,
you'll
find
that
he
is
correct
in
going
back,
that
the
maritime
law
is
the
oldest
law
in
the
world.
definitely
goes
back
to
the
phoenicians.
there's
evidence
that
it
went
back
to
the
herodians
in
the
7th
century
b.c.
the
principles
of
justice
and
equity
that
men
sought
were
there.
judge
learned
hand
in
his
irritation
that
congressional
interference
in
the
province
of
the
judges
to
determine
the
law
had
gone
further
and
our
court
in
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
than
they
used
to,
i
hope
it
will
stay
that
way.
the
court
has
before
it
i
think,
a
case
of
major
importance.
remember
this,
i
was
a
lawyer
who
fought
this
o'neill
case,
cunard,
lost
it,
no
writ
granted,
hold
them
against
the
american
line,
hamburg-american
line,
same
thing,
no
writ
granted.
and
finally,
this
case,
a
writ
was
granted
because
the
tort
was
so
mixed
with
negligence
of
shore
companies
and
shore
service
that
justice
could
be
done
required
that
it
be
considered.
now,
we
can't
dock
it
back.
it's
on
--
at
the
end.
thank
you.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i
would
have
said
something
more
but
i
shan't.
