justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
notice
that
from
your
brief,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
it.
what
is
essence
of
your
objection
to
the
taking
of
evidence
on
the
jurisdictional
motion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
say
that
on
a
jurisdictional
question
a
court
must
dispose
off
it
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
and
that
it
cannot
be
disposed
of
on
the
face
of
compliant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
it
has
to
go
to
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
it
has
to
go
to
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
otherwise
stated
what
you
are
saying
as
i
understand
it
is,
when
the
plaintiff
alleges
in
good
faith
a
cause
of
action
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
then
jury,
there
is
no
trial
to
be
had
on
the
part
of
jurisdiction
if
you
go
immediately
to
merits.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
ultimately
went
back
before
a
remit
in
light
of
the
seven
points
that
justice
jackson
said
would
be
controlling
or
should
be
taken
into
consideration.
that
is
what
happened.
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
client
has
been
dropped
out
plaintiff
had
chosen
to
go
along
against
the
other
three
you
would
have
had
diversity,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
why
--
would
they
give
an
opportunity
to
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
from
the
point
of
view
of
way
the
case
ended
up
having
read
what
you
have
shown
me
here,
they
haven't
refused
to
take
the
avenue
of
the
diversity,
the
diversity
avenue
is
a
(inaudible)
merits
his
holding
(inaudible)
in
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
facet
is
the
jurisdiction
against
your
client
that
that
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
a
lump
sum.
