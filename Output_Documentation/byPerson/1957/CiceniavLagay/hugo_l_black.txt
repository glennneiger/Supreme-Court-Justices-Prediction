whether
it
was
done
flippantly
or
courteously,
the
fact
remained
for
over
seven
hours,
newark
believes
formed
an
insuperable
between
an
accused
who
wanted
to
see
his
counsel
and
the
counsel
who
wanted
to
see
his
client,
was
that
based
on
evidence?

during
this

justice

l.
black
i
noticed
you
relied
on
the
groban
case,
decided
in
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
what
you
say
is
and
maybe
i'm
wrong.
if
it
has
no
materiality
but
i
understand
what
you
say
is
that
the
state
court
could
have
declined
to
consider
the
case
and
decide
it
because
it
was
out
of
time.
they
also
had
the
power
to
waive
that
if
they
so
desire
to
consider
the
merits.
and
you
say
that's
what
they
did.
