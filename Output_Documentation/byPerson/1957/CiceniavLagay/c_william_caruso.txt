mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members.
what
the
petitioner
says
here
very
briefly
is
this.
"i
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
counsel
when
i
was
being
interrogated
by
the
police
in
newark
headquarters
and
i
was
denied
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
the
right
to
a
pretrial
inspection
of
this
confession.
therefore,
my
constitutional
rights
of
due
process
have
been
denied."
well,
that's
summoned
totally.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
now,
on
that
specific
question,
this
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
well,
on
the
question
of
counsel,
there
are
--
you
can
divide
that
up
into
two
subsidiary
questions.
first,
did
the
petitioner
ask
for
counsel?
secondly,
did
counsel
appear
there
for
him
and
was
he
denied
the
right
to
see
his
client?
now,
in
order
to
get
this
clear,
the
record
shows
specifically
that
on
the
question
of
the
petitioner
asking
for
his
counsel,
that
was
seriously
disputed
by
the
state
in
that
record.
petitioner
in
the
hearing
before
the
district
court
judge
kept
saying
--
these
were
the
facts
of
course
the
crime
took
place
a
long
time
ago,
march
17th,
1947.
there
was
nothing
--
there
was
nothing,
no
solution
to
this
crime
until
december
of
1949.
that's
over
two
years
later
and
it
came
about
in
this
way.
the
first
man
to
be
arrested
was
corvino.
he's
one
of
the
joint
defendants
in
the
indictment.
corvino
was
taken
of
the
custody
on
december
17th,
1949
and
it
was
the
result
of
what
corvino
told
the
police
that
the
newark
police
alerted
the
orange
police
to
seek
out
not
only
this
petitioner,
cicenia,
but
the
other
third
defendant
who
was
demasi.
now
what
happened
on
the
17th?
petitioner
has
no
dispute.
these
are
facts,
was
out,
some
orange
police
called
at
his
home
that
we'd
like
to
see
cicenia,
bothered,
i
think
in
their
home
since
--
well
he
went
hunting
today
with
his
brother
and
now
tell
--
he
says,
"when
he
come,
tell
him
to
get
consent
to
the
orange
police.
we
want
to
see
him."
cicenia
didn't
come
home
on
the
night
of
december
17
in
orange.
there
was
a
call
made
to
mr.
palmieri
or
frank
palmieri
is
the
name
of
the
attorney
who
represented
this
petitioner
cicenia
many
long
after
that.
palmieri
told
the
bar,
“okay,
let
this
cicenia
go
into
the
police
and
give
up”
give
himself
up
and
he
did.
now
we
come
to
summary
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
no.
mr.
chief
justice,
this
was
still
in
the
process
of
investigation.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
well
--
no
that
is
not
even
in
the
record.
i
don't
--
let
me
withdraw
that.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
as
a
result
of
a
telephone
conversation
between
mr.
palmieri,
the
lawyer,
and
this
petitioner's
father
regardless
of
everything
else.
cicenia
presented
himself
on
sunday
morning
in
orange
police
headquarters.
that
was
around
9
o'clock
in
the
morning.
at
about
10
o'clock,
two
officers
of
newark
came
to
orange
and
brought
him
to
newark.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
well,
five
miles,
four
miles
between
newark
headquarters
and
orange.
orange
--
the
city
of
orange
is
a
suburb
of
the
city
of
newark
about
four
or
five
miles
away.
now
we
got
to
the
point
where
cicenia
is
down
in
newark
police
headquarters.
at
that
time,
corvino
was
down
in
the
police
headquarters,
but
not
demasi
yet,
the
third
man.
demasi
came
in
at
about
the
same
time.
when
i
say
"came
in"
i
mean
"brought
in"
by
the
newark
police,
and
he
got
in
newark
police
headquarters
on
sunday
morning,
december
18th,
1949,
three
men
who
were
later
indicted
for
the
felony
murder
of
the
store
keeper
in
newark
back
in
march
17th,
1947.
now,
what
happened?
the
first
thing
that
happened
to
cicenia
was
naturally
what
we
call
processing,
photographing,
fingerprinting
and
putting
him
in
the
cell.
because
mr.
chief
justice,
practice,
this
is
sunday,
hardly
anybody
in
police
headquarters
at
all
but
the
practice
is
these
matters
are
usually
investigated
by
a
particular
squad.
on
this
case,
it
was
a
homicide
squad
of
newark
police
headquarters.
the
first
man
to
come
in
the
police
headquarters
that
talked
to
cicenia
was
a
lieutenant
of
the
newark
police
by
the
name
of
joseph
kenney.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
in
his
cell,
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
no
complaint,
no
warrant
as
such
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
--
killing
as
the
result
of
information
imparted
to
the
police
by
armando
corvino
who
was
taken
in
the
night
before.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that's
right.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
now
kenney
came
in
about
noon
hour.
well,
what
--
i
mean,
what
happened
between
10
and
noon?
well
i
could
(inaudible)
photographing
and
fingerprinting
and
putting
him
in
the
cell.
to
awake
mr.
kenney,
he
is
the
lieutenant,
head
of
the
homicide
squad.
kenney
came
in
about
noon.
now
--
about
noon,
possibly
around
well
it
has
to
be
something
to
that
sort,
having
question
mr.
cicenia
for
maybe
10
or
15
minutes
and
according
to
kenney
at
first,
cicenia
said,
“i
don't
know
what
you
are
talking
about.”
he
didn't
know
anything
about
this.
then
kenney
said
--
but
later
after
he
was
confronted
with
demasi,
he
changed
the
story.
now,
let
me
get
that
straight.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
confronted
with
a
third
defendant,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
a
man
with
a
name
of
joseph
demasi.
see,
demasi
was
the
third
man.
we
got
here
cicenia,
corvino
and
demasi.
now,
we
won't
go
into
the
crime
at
all.
now,
after
all
questioning
that
kenney
then
what
happened?
kenney
sent
for
a
prosecutor's
detective
by
the
name
of
george
marr,
a
man
who's
been
experienced
classically
30
odd
years.
i
know
that
personally.
a
man
--
still
at
least
detective
marr,
now
we've
gotten
in
the
picture,
kenney,
and
i
want
to
add
one
other
member
of
the
homicide
squad
named
--
by
the
name
of
carlton
norris
and
we
have
george
marr.
now,
there's
three.
two
members
of
the
local
homicide
squad
and
one
member
of
the
prosecutor's
detective.
when
marr
came
in
about
little
after
1
o'clock,
he
called
with
cicenia
(inaudible)
they
went
out
to
get
something
to
eat.
in
fact,
cicenia
said,
"they
didn't
give
me
anything
to
eat
all
day."
the
truth
was,
at
1
o'clock,
he
was
fed.
now,
george
marr
was
the
man
who
really
was
assigned
to
take
all
the
information
as
far
as
cicenia
is
concerned.
kenney
was
the
man
who
was
assigned
to
take
another
man,
corvino,
and
demasi
was
taken
by
detective
norris.
now
altogether,
throughout
the
entire
day,
besides
these
three
men
whose
names
i
just
mentioned,
there
were
only
two
others
in
the
headquarters
who
are
in
anyway
connected
with
the
investigation
of
this
case.
one
was
an
assistant
prosecutor,
morris
mccune
(ph)
and
the
other
was
an
investigator
for
the
prosecutor
by
the
name
of
harvey
gruley
(ph);
gruley
didn't
question
them,
mccune
didn't
question
them,
but
he
was
there
supervising.
now,
if
i
can
explain,
we
have
a
system
in
--
in
new
jersey,
in
--
capital
cases
of
this
kind
where
suspects
are
taken
into
custody,
we
want
a
representative
of
the
prosecutor's
office
here
to
see
things
are
done
properly
and
that's
the
reason
for
mccune,
mccune
did
--
he's
in
and
out
and
so
forth.
now,
what
happens
to
this?
detective
marr
questioned
cicenia,
and
said,
“how
about
this?”
and
in
the
record,
you'll
find
that
cicenia
puts
it
this
way,
"oh,
they
threw,
words
he
used
--
they
threw
a
lot
of
photographs
at
me.
photographs
of
the
place
where
the
crime
was
committed,
the
store,
inside,
outside,
i
didn't
know
what
it
was
all
about,
but
he
changed
his
story
after
he
was
told
by
detective
marr
what
demasi
had
said
about
this
crime
in
which
he
has
involved
cicenia.
no
question
about
it.
now
there
were
two
questionings,
your
honors,
one
was
preliminary,
15
-
20
minutes,
about
noon
by
kenney
and
after
1
o'clock
by
detective
marr
of
the
prosecutor's
office,
in
which
he
spent
possibly
half
hour
or
more.
and
then
he
gave
him
an
oral
account
of
the
entire
crime.
i
don't
know
whether
on
pages
103
and
104,
two
full
pages.
there
is
an
account
in
the
record
of
the
details
of
the
oral
account
of
the
crime
given
by
cicenia
to
marr.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i
don't
know
exactly,
your
honor
--
oh,
40
minutes,
40
minutes,
a
matter
of
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
no,
no.
that's
that
oral
statement.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
see,
this
is
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i'm
going
to
come
with
his
confession.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
this
is
an
oral
statement
of
giving
them
to
marr
and
now
the
--
that
is
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
oh,
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
oh,
yes,
complete
guilt.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
now,
that
took
place
in
the
afternoon,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
about
4
o'clock.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
now,
the
time
comes
for
the
taking
down
of
the
written
confession.
now,
we
must
bear
in
mind
around
three
people
here,
three
men,
all
in
this
one
great
big
room
on
the
fourth
floor
of
newark
headquarters,
and
here's
the
way
they
were
divided.
marr
has
this
petitioner,
detective
marr,
seated
alongside.
marr
already
know
the
full
story,
which
cicenia,
had
given
him
about
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
but
the
written
confession
wasn't
start
until
5:07
in
the
early
evening
and
ended
about
8:30.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
it's
written
down
by
detective
marr
in
wrong
hand.
that,
if
your
honor
please,
the
only
--
was
not
admitted
in
the
record
at
all
(inaudible)
except
this.
you
will
find
in
the
record
that
when
cicenia
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
judge,
i
showed
him
his
this
confession
and
you
notice
the
manner
in
which
he
answered
frankly.
oh,
possibly,
is
this
your
signature?
possibly,
oh
yes,
(inaudible).
finally,
he
did
say
yes.
then
with
respect
to
the
contents
of
that
confession,
judge
forman
rule
in
favor
of
defense
attorney
who
have
made
an
objection
on
the
question
of
the
detail
of
the
commission
of
a
crime.
i'll
go
on
that.
let
me
go
back
now
to
the
question
in
the
record
with
respect.
did
the
petitioner,
cicenia
ask
for
assistance
of
counsel?
in
the
record,
yes,
he
says
it
several
times,
even
repeatedly.
but
if
your
honor
please,
he
didn't
even
know
that
his
lawyer
palmeiri
was
down
there
where
he
was
left.
his
father
had
called
up
palmeiri
but
when
he
was
there
(inaudible)
they
didn't
know
that
palmieri
have
been
there.
now,
how
did
palmeiri
--
palmeiri
is
the
name
of
the
lawyer
of
the
petitioner
who
came
down
(inaudible)
at
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
the
petitioner.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
16?
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
i
say,
i
still
stand
by
and
it's
a
distinction.
cicenia,
who
was
inside,
didn't
know
that
his
lawyer
was
outside
knocking
on
the
door.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i'm
coming
to
that.
not
the
lawyer
showed
at
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
now,
what
did
he
do?
he
first
went
to
the
doorman
or
the
telephone
man,
mr.
cone.
i
want
to
see
mr.
cicenia.
mr.
cone
is
the
only
uniformed
officer
off-duty
in
that
building.
very
simple.
now,
i
haven't
got
the
authority
to
do
that.
well,
"i
want
to
see
him"
says
mr.
palmeiri
to
cone.
cone
sent
for
mr.
norris,
that's
norris.
now,
carlson
norris
is
the
detective
who
have
been
--
who
had
also
questioned
the
petitioner
and
who
was
taking
the
time
to
take
the
confession
from
demasi.
norris
came
down.
now,
i'm
coming
to
this
big
one.
there
was
an
affidavit
submitted
by
mr.
palmeiri
in
the
proceeding
in
which
he
has
said
to
norris,
i
want
to
see
my
client
and
norris
said,
“i
--
i
can't
let
you
see
your
client."
“i've
got
to
see
my
client.”
“well,
wait
a
minute.”
nevertheless,
norris
was
asked,
“what
about
this?
not
seeing
the
client."
and
then
a
great
big
point
is
made
of
it
that
norris
says
--
is
alleged
to
have
said,
“oh,
we
get
this
everyday.”
it
goes
in
one
ear
and
out
the
other.
norris
denied
in
the
record
the
conversation
which
is
stated
by
the
lawyer
palmeiri.
he
did
say,
frankly,
about
the
--
he
did
say,
and
here
it
is,
first
on
page
120,
near
the
bottom,
and
during
the
course
of
this
interrogation
or
at
anytime
that
you
hear
mr.
cicenia
have
to
see
counsel?
answer
-
he
did
not,
sir.
he
never
mentioned
counsel.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
mr.
norris.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
well,
he
was
one
of
the
investigating
officers.
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
oh
no,
marr
was
the
man
who
was
taking
this
defendant.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
marr
has
a
control
of
taking
his
confession
which
he
definitely
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
norris
was
right
there.
this
is
all
in
the
same
room.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
norris
was
asked
about
counsel
read
from
the
affidavit
of
mr.
palmeiri
in
which
palmeiri
said
that
he
tried
to
see
his
client
and
asked
mr.
norris,
and
he
quoted,
page
121
of
the
record.
and
after
he
finished
the
quoting
from
palmeiri's
affidavit,
he
asked
norris,
“i
asked
you
if
that
in
substance
is
what
occurred
about
4:30
p.m.
at
the
newark
police
headquarter.”
answer
-
“i
never
had
such
a
conversation
with
mr.
palmeiri
like
that,
no
conversation
like
that.
in
the
first
place,
i'm
not
in
charge
and
it
would
not
be
within
my
scope
to
even
have
a
conversation
with
him.”
he
did
not
ask
you
to
see
mr.
cicenia?”
“no
sir.”
now
here's
the
thing
which
frightens
everybody.
norris
said,
“within
one
ear
and
out
the
other."
norris
was
asked
about
the
--
about
the
practice
in
newark
on
this
occasions
and
here's
the
exact
--
his
explanation
on
page
122.
by
that
time,
i
had
heard
he
had
an
attorney
and
that
an
attorney
was
there
but
i
wasn't
interested.
i
mean,
we
have
that
everyday.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
no.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
this
is
--
this
is
the
opinion
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
--
of
judge
forman.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i
can
say
this
without
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
he
said
that.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i
say
that
judge
forman
said
that
he
was
denied
an
attorney
and
that
is
founded
upon
the
request
made
by
the
attorney
of
the
assistant
prosecutor
mccune.
we
don't
have
to
go
to
that.
we
admit
that
mr.
--
the
attorney
was
there,
mr.
mccune
admitted
it.
he's
the
assistant
prosecutor.
he
came
downstairs
and
talked
with
mr.
palmeiri,
and
then
this
is
what
mr.
mccune
said
to
the
attorney.
this
is
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
no,
sir.
that's
admitted
by
the
state.
that's
--
that
the
attorney
was
denied
permission
to
see
his
client.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
the
denial
was
made
with
a
qualification.
you
will
see
him
as
soon
as
we're
through
with
the
police
investigation,
any
day.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that's
a
fact.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that's
a
fact,
your
honor.
that's
a
fact.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes,
and
we
stand
on
the
law
of
new
jersey,
which
was
established
many
years
ago,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
case
of
state
against
murphy.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
now
in
that
case,
the
opinion
which
of
course
--
which
are
quoted.
here
is
what
he
says
in
so
many
words.
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
and
of
the
state
constitution
which
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
sixth
amendment
simply
says
this.
i
will
enter
many
words.
"every
accused
is
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial
by
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,"
number
one.
number
two,
"he
is
entitled
to
know."
now,
the
word
"trial"
is
used
right
there.
number
two,
"he
is
entitled
to
know
the
nature
of
the
accusation
and
cause
of
the
accusation."
number
three,
"he
is
entitled
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him."
number
four,
"he
is
entitled
to
have
compulsory
process
for
witnesses
in
his
favor"
and
then
it
ends
up
the
paragraph
by
saying,
"and
he's
entitled
to
the
aid
and
assistance
of
his
counsel
for
his
defense."
in
interpreting
that
section,
if
your
honors
please,
(inaudible)
i
think
used
this
reasoning,
is
that
accused
entitled
to
be
confronted
by
witnesses
against
them
when
he
is
seated
in
the
room
alongside
of
the
detective
who
is
hearing
this
story?
well,
of
course
not.
is
he
entitled
to
have
compulsory
process
for
witnesses
in
his
favor?
in
other
words,
if
the
defendant
says
to
the
police,
"why
don't
you
see
john
doe
or
richard
roe
held
thereof
what
i
say."
do
the
police
have
(inaudible)?
the
police
do
their
own
checking
and
there
isn't
any
question
gentlemen
in
instructing
when
--
at
a
two-storey
(inaudible)
were
similar.
we
know
that
he's
gotten
it
cleared.
but
more
or
else
when
checking,
it
is
not
(inaudible).
now,
we
have
maintained
in
new
jersey,
ever
since
1915
and
prior
to
what
clearly
established
by
the
highest
court
of
new
jersey
in
1915
that
an
accused
has
the
constitutional
right
to
the
aid
and
assistance
of
his
counsel
at
his
defense
and
that
contemplates
when
he
is
placed
in
jeopardy
at
the
trial
and
not
during
the
time
between
the
arrest
and
his
arraignment.
that
has
been
time
and
time
again,
your
honors,
state
against
murphy,
state
against
(inaudible)
that
came
to
this
court,
certiorari
denied
and
i
answered
exactly
the
same
question.
state
against
grillo
(inaudible)
state
against
cole,
i
remember
those
cases
very
well.
certiorari
denied
by
this
court
in
the
cole
case,
in
the
burns
case.
well,
that's
number
one.
what
happens
after
these
people
were
held
the
next
morning
incidentally,
the
arraignment
took
place
at
11
o'clock
on
the
19th
of
december
and
from
the
night
of
the
18th
of
december
when
mr.
palmieri
was
allowed
to
go
in
to
see
his
client,
he
has
the
benefit
of
that
lawyer
from
that
time
on
up
to
the
time
of
sentence
on
april
18th,
1951.
all
was
(inaudible).
but
the
counsel
didn't
do
anything.
as
soon
as
they
were
indicted
by
the
grand
jury,
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
go
into
courts
and
say,
“i
want
a
copy
of
that
confession.”
and
how
do
you
suppose
he
would
handle
the
court?
on
the
theory
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
absolute
right
to
a
copy
of
that
confession.
well,
the
appellate
division
in
new
jersey
denied
that.
they
threw
him
out.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
would
like
to
address
one
sentence
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
he
asked
the
pointed
question
as
to
whether
we
question
the
accuracy
of
judge
forman's
statement
which
is
pointed
out
in
which
in
his
opinion,
which
he
said
not
only
was
the
petitioner
deprived
of
the
cherished
american
rights
but
the
dignity
of
his
legal
profession
was
demeaned
and
so
forth.
the
fact
of
the
matter,
that
in
the
hearing,
there
never
was
any
dispute
about
that.
in
fact,
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
the
assistant
prosecutor
went
down
and
met
mr.
palmieri.
mr.
palmieri
said,
“i'd
like
to
see
cicenia
can
i
hear
him
out.
mr.
palmieri
--
mr.
mccune
(ph),
the
assistant
prosecutor
politely
told,
"just
as
soon
as
we
complete
our
investigation"
although
there
was
no
denial
about
it.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
rule
of
law
in
new
jersey
that
a
lawyer
is
not
entitled
to
see
his
client
during
the
time
between
arrest
and
arraignment.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that
is
the
reason.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
it's
the
rule.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
well,
i'd
say
we
stood
by
new
jersey
law
not
to
hold
this
--.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
you
haven't
said
so
yet.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
you
haven't
said
so
yet.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that
was
our
position.
now,
if
you
want
to
interpret
the
sixth
amendment,
to
me
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
anytime.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i've
been
a
practicing
criminal
lawyer
for
many
years.
and
i
know
--
let's
look
at
it
practically.
i
told
this
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there's
only
one
reason
why
a
lawyer
wants
to
get
in
there
to
see
his
client
at
a
time
when
he
is
being
interrogated.
well,
there
you
don't
even
have
to
talk
to
him.
i've
been
a
lawyer.
i
want
to
--
i've
been
in
that
same
position
many
a
time.
i
want
to
see
you.
i
don't
care
to
talk
to,
just
let
me
see
you.
why?
mr.
c.
william
caruso
when
i
see
him
i'm
going
to
say
to
him,
“sshh”.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
yes,
when
he's
not
under
oath
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
he's
not
under
oath.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
he's
not
under
oath.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
the
man
is
trying
to
tell
a
story
and
the
police
are
trying
to
get
it
from
a
man
who
learned
the
truth.
where
would
our
law
enforcement
be
today,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
in
every
case
a
lawyer
comes
bouncing
in
and
says,
“i
want
to
see
him.”
that's
all
there
told.
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
push
everything
aside,
your
honor
here,
come
on
in.
why,
you
show
him
immediately
when
the
thing
would
have
come
--
there
was
no
rough
stuff
used.
immediately
after
the
confession
with
--
maybe
go
ahead
and
see
him
and
he
saw
him
every
minute
that
time
from
that
time
forward.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
through
with
him?
mr.
c.
william
caruso
well,
when
i
say
through
with
him
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
--
don't
misinterpret
that
word.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes,
when
they
completed
their
--
mr.
c.
william
caruso
yes.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that's
right.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that's
it.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
thank
you.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
c.
william
caruso
groban?
mr.
c.
william
caruso
that's
the
case
of
the
fire
marshal
having
a
hearing
in
which
certain
witnesses
refused
to
be
sworn
and
refused
to
testify?
yes,
i
read
that
case,
your
honor.
and
in
that
case,
what
was
the
conclusion?
do
you
use
exactly
these
words?
there's
a
man,
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel?
and
for
the
same
reason,
when
this
fire
marshal
was
trying
to
find
out
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
upon
which
to
face
a
criminal
charge
of
arson
or
whatever
the
court
or
the
fire
might
have
been,
that
is
groban.
i
relied
upon
it,
yes
mr.
justice
black.
thank
you.
mr.
c.
william
caruso
thank
you
very,
very
much.
