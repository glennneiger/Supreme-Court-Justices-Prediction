does
the
record
show,
enable
you
to
add
up
the
total
period
of
the
questioning
that
produced
the
confession.
justice
john
m.
harlan
an
hour
and
a
half.
justice
john
m.
harlan
apart
from
--
apart
from
your
claim
of
right
to
counsel,
do
you
claim
that
this
was
a
coerced
confession?
justice
john
m.
harlan
simply
that
single
point
that
you're
raising.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
before
this
man
was
brought
from
orange
to
newark,
he
already
had
engaged
a
lawyer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
the
police
knew
that
he
had
a
lawyer
when
they
start
interrogating.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
when
your
man
got
over
to
newark
and
they
started
questioning
him,
did
he
say,
"i've
got
a
lawyer.
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
submit
to
questioning
without
having
my
lawyer
present."
did
he
raise
that
right
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
is
there
any
question
here
that
--
any
--
any
attempt
to
justify
a
refusal
to
have
counsel
present
after
he
requested
it
on
the
ground
that
they
weren't
sure
that
this
fellow
in
fact
or
the
lawyer
in
fact
represented
this
fellow?
