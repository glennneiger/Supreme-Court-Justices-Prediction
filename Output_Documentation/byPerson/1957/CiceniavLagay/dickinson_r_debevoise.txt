mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
which
a
constitutional
question
arising
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
being
reviewed.
the
facts,
i
think,
are
essentially
agreed
upon
by
both
sides
in
the
case.
very
briefly,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
and
questioned
in
connection
with
the
murder.
the
arrest
taking
place
at
about
9
o'clock
on
december
18th,
1949.
he
was
taken
to
the
orange,
new
jersey
police
station
at
about
9
o'clock
and
from
there
he
was
taken
to
the
newark,
new
jersey
police
station
arriving
at
approximately
10
o'clock
in
the
morning.
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
amount
of
questioning
to
which
he
was
subjected
during
the
course
of
the
day,
but
there's
no
question
that
he
was
--
he
was
interrogated
from
time
to
time
by
the
newark
police.
there
was
a
representative
of
the
essex
county
prosecutor's
office
present
and
that
continued
from
the
time
he
arrived
in
newark
intermittently
until
he
signed
a
statement
at
approximately
9:30
in
the
evening.
the
significant
thing
was
that
--
at
approximately
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
the
time
he
arrived
at
the
newark,
new
jersey
police
station
at
about
10
o'clock.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no
complaint,
unless
possibly
--
there
was
no
warrant
for
his
arrest
but
we're
not
raising
that
issue.
there
was
no
questioning
--
formal
questioning
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes,
i
--
i
will
go
into
that
in
detail
if
you
like,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
at
10
o'clock,
he
arrived
in
the
police
station
and
according
to
his
testimony,
he
went
through
the
formalities
which
accompany
any
arrest,
photographing,
fingerprinting
and
the
like.
mr.
cicenia
stated
that
he
was
questioned
shortly
afterwards
and
then
periodically
throughout
the
day.
many
times,
he
couldn't
remember
exactly
how
many.
one
of
the
newark
detectives
testified
that
he
was
questioned
at
about
12:30,
12:15,
for
maybe
30
minutes,
35
minutes,
then
would
return
to
his
cell
while
other
suspects
were
questioned.
that
he
was
brought
out
of
his
cell
again
at
about
3
o'clock,
questioned
further,
returned
to
his
cell
and
then
at
approximately
5
o'clock
--
6
o'clock,
his
statement
was
taken
from
him
by
one
of
the
detectives.
the
detective
who
took
the
statement
estimated
that
it
was
about
a
three-hour
undertaking
to
write
it
down
in
longhand
and
the
petitioner
himself
recollects
about
one
hour,
but
i
think
in
this
instance,
the
detective
memory
would
be
more
reliable.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
the
total
period
of
questioning,
which
is
in
the
record
and
not
disputed
would
be
approximately
an
hour
and
a
half,
i
would
say.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes,
adding
the
two
together.
now,
beyond
that,
there
is
dispute
in
the
record
and
therefore,
i
would
assume
that
i
can't
say
that
that
--
there
was
more.
the
petitioner's
attorney
arrived
at
the
newark
police
station
at
2
o'clock
and
that
is
well
documented
without
dispute.
he
immediately
asked
to
see
the
client
asking
the
detective
at
the
desk
and
he
was
denied
admission
at
that
time.
he
was
denied
admission
periodically
throughout
the
afternoon.
and
the
words
of
one
of
the
detective's,
attorney
bother
us,
comes
in
one
ear
out
the
other,
we
pay
no
attention
to
them,
which
characterized
the
attitude
of
the
entire
prosecutors
and
newark
police
staff
at
that
time.
at
9:30,
the
man's
signature
was
placed
on
the
confession
and
the
attorney
was
admitted
to
see
him
at
that
point.
the
next
morning,
he
was
arraigned
before
the
magistrate
and
pleaded
not
guilty.
as
the
case
of
the
defense
prepared
for
the
trial
of
this
case,
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
this
confession
and
there
was
a
motion
o
inspect
it,
combined
at
one
motion.
now,
the
state's
brief
which
says
that
no
effort
was
made
to
attack
the
confession
in
the
state
courts.
now,
i
would
submit
that
this
--
the
motion
to
inspect
and
to
suppress
was
certainly
an
attack
on
the
confession
and
it
was
raised
as
early
in
the
proceedings
as
possible.
the
motion
was
denied
in
both
respects.
the
petitioner
was
neither
permitted
to
have
the
confession
suppressed
and
he
was
not
permitted
to
examine
it.
after
failing
to
reach
that
result,
the
petitioner
pleaded
non
vult
to
this
--
to
the
indictment.
he
knew
he
couldn't
see
the
confession.
he
knew
it
would
be
a
part
of
the
case
against
him
and
as
the
prosecutor
of
essex
county
pointed
out,
this
confession,
together
with
the
two
others
which
were
taken
at
the
same
time
constituted
the
heart
of
the
case
against
the
petitioner.
now
these
--
these
facts
raise
the
question
of
"when
does
the
right
to
counsel
begin?"
there's
a
subsidiary
question
of
whether
or
not
a
petitioner
in
these
circumstances
may
see
the
statement
which
he
signed
prior
to
his
trial,
but
the
emphasis
in
this
case
has
been
the
right
to
counsel
during
the
period
between
arrest
and
the
arraignment.
now
the
law
has
long
recognized,
and
this
court
has
long
recognized,
that
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
in
certain
circumstances
if
the
general
rights
which
any
defendant
may
--
may
be
able
to
take
advantage
of.
now,
the
cases
have
not
dealt
with
this
particular
situation.
it's
a
right
which
have
been
suggested
in
different
context
at
different
times,
different
places,
but
the
spirit
behind
all
these
cases
is
fairness
under
the
circumstances
to
an
accused.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
i'm
--
that
i'm
arguing
this
as
if
it
came
directly
from
the
new
jersey
supreme
court?
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
to
review
a
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes,
that's
--
that
is
the
basis
in
which
i'm
appealing.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
some
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
the
factual
or
perhaps
the
factual
data
will
be
reviewed
with
more
scrutiny.
i
said
that
it
is
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
the
--
any
factual
question
of
the
course
are
resolved
against
petitioner.
i
--
i
think
you
will
probably
examine
it
more
closely
than
you
would.
we're
at
a
--
in
effect,
an
appeal
from
the
judge.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
your
honor,
i
--
i
cannot
--
and
i
definitely,
i
am
convinced
that
you
have
--
you
may
review
this
case
--
this
question
in
this
case.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
i'm
proceeding
on
jurisdiction
under
the
statute.
i
--
permitting
habeas
corpus.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i
--
to
proceed,
your
honor,
on
the
merits
of
the
question,
i
would
suggest
that
recent
cases
of
this
court
do
indicate
that
the
right
to
counsel
should
exist
in
a
case
of
its
nature,
in
a
murder
case,
capital
case,
during
the
time
between
the
arrest
and
the
arraignment
when
--
when
the
--
when
the
petitioner,
when
the
accused
is
being
questioned
by
the
police
officials.
i
would
suggest
that
the
groban
case,
of
course
in
a
different
situation,
infers
that
in
a
criminal
matter,
counsel
should
be
permitted
to
consult
with
his
client
during
questioning,
which
precedes
arraignment
when
the
police
are
seeking
to
obtain
information.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
would
maintain
that
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
now,
in
many
cases
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
in
a
capital
case
is
the
one
i'm
concerned.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i
think
that
of
course
is
the
strongest
case.
the
fikes
case
which
was
recently
before
this
court,
again,
additional
circumstances,
but
again,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
was
not
permitted
to
see
his
father.
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
an
attorney.
the
case
arising
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
murphy
case,
again,
great
emphasis
was
placed
in
the
fact
that
a
petitioner
was
not
allowed
to
see
an
attorney
during
the
period
of
his
interrogation.
i
think
when
we
decide
whether
or
not
this
is
a
due
process
requirement,
we
are
--
judge
forman
stated
in
the
district
court
on
the
boarder
line
of
due
process.
in
determining
which
side
of
that
line
we
are
on,
i
don't
think
it's
a
mess
to
examine
the
benefits
and
the
burdens
which
would
result
from
a
rule
requiring
a
presence
of
counsel
during
a
period
of
interrogation
by
police.
the
benefits
it
would
seem
to
me
are
substantial.
in
every
case,
the
rights
of
an
accused
would
be
safeguarded
by
the
presence
of
counsel
during
or
at
least
from
time
to
time
during
his
interrogation
by
the
police.
the
situation
is
one
where
the
accused
is
alone,
is
usually
confronted
with
one
or
many
more
police
or
prosecution
officials.
he's
not
as
advised
to
his
rights,
necessarily.
the
record
his
statement
is
not
a
stenographic
record.
it's
a
record
taken
down
by
a
detective
or
a
prosecution
official.
usually,
often,
it's
leading
questions,
the
petitioner
will
answer
with
a
yes
or
a
no
and
then
the
leading
question
is
written
down
as
if
it
were
an
affirmative
statement.
naturally,
the
person
can't
remember
what
he
said.
he
can't
remember
what
he
signed,
which
is
not
an
uncommon
situation
even
for
someone
under
--
or
normal
circumstances.
he
is
not
provided
with
a
copy
of
the
statement
after
he
has
--
after
he
has
signed
it
and
he
usually
cannot
obtain
a
copy
before
the
trial
when
it's
used
against
him
by
the
prosecution.
but
in
addition
to
this,
which
is
any
case
where
there
is
prolonged
or
--
not
necessarily
prolonged
interrogation,
beyond
this,
these
circumstances
are
conducive
to
much,
much
worse.
they're
conducive
to
force
confessions,
coercion
and
other
unfortunate
practices
which
we
know
do
occur
from
time
to
time.
now,
a
criminal
case
is
like
a
civil
case
and
that
it's
an
adversary
proceeding.
theoretically,
the
prosecutor
is
representing
the
interest
of
the
public,
the
accused,
as
well
as
anyone
else
but
in
practice
and
perhaps
necessarily,
he
has
to
present
the
strong
points
of
his
own
case
and
the
weak
points
of
the
defendant's
case.
but
unlike
a
civil
action,
the
accused
does
not
have
the
advantage
or
the
opportunity
to
obtain
access
to
the
data,
the
information,
the
statements,
which
are
to
be
used
against
him
at
the
trial.
his
hands
are
tied.
they're
tied
during
this
interrogation
period.
they're
tied
right
up
until
the
trial
itself.
now,
the
state
is
partisan.
it
zealously
tries
to
convict
the
defendants
i
brought
before
the
court
of
a
state
or
a
federal
court
if
that's
the
situation.
now
--
and
that
--
i
think
that
it
should
be.
i
have
no
--
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
but
if
this
zeal
is
unchecked,
we
know
it
can
lead
to
injustice.
we
know
for
a
fact
that
on
occasion,
defendants
who
are
innocent
have
been
convicted.
we
know
for
a
fact
that
they
have,
on
occasion,
been
convicted
as
a
result
of
their
own
confessions.
now,
we
don't
have
statics.
we
can't
get
statistics
of
course,
but
we
can
affirm
from
the
number
of
cases
we
do
know
about
if
there
must
be
an
infinitely
larger
number
of
cases
where
a
defendant
wrongly
takes
the
penalty
for
something
which
he
did
not
do.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
the
facts
are
in
dispute
on
the
issue
of
coercion
and
we
have
to
--
we
--
we
cannot
raise
that
issue
here,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
the
single
point
plus
the
additional
fact
that
the
defendant
tried
to
get
access
to
his
confession
after
he'd
given
it
and
was
denied
that
access,
which
as
we
see
it,
it
--
it's
part
of
the
same
thing.
as
part
of
your
right
to
counsel
is
the
right
to
have
counsel,
get
the
material
he
needs
to
defend
the
case.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
your
honor.
my
contention
would
be
that
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
my
contention
would
be
that
in
a
capital
case,
if
there
were
questioning,
if
counsel
were
asked
for
and
denied
or
counsel
asked
permission
or
not
allowed
admission,
you
could
not
use
that
confession
or
statement
against
the
defendant
in
the
trial
against
him.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
our
case
is
a
request
for
counsel
and
denial.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
at
the
point
when
questioning
begins,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
the
questioning
began
here
--
at
least
we
know
it
began
as
soon
as
an
hour
and
three
quarters
or
two
hours,
two
and
a
quarter
hours,
after
he
was
brought
to
the
newark
police
station.
that
would
be
about
12:15.
he
arrived
at
newark
at
about
10
o'clock
in
the
morning.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes,
your
honor.
he
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
newark
police
knew
we
had
a
lawyer
when
they
began
interrogating
him.
again,
that
would
be
a
disputed
question.
he
testified
that
he
told
him
he
had
counsel.
counsel
had
been
retained
by
--
by
him
and
his
family
that
morning
and
also,
they
contact
a
counsel
the
day
before.
counsel
himself
did
not
arrive
in
newark
until
2
o'clock,
which
was
after
one
of
the
periods
of
questioning
before
a
subsequent
period
of
questioning
and
at
that
point,
inform
the
newark
police
and
the
prosecutor's
office
that
he
represented
the
defendant.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
was
his
testimony,
your
honor.
it
was
disputed
by
the
state.
they
say
he
did
not
asked
for
a
lawyer.
the
petitioner
claims
that
he
did.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel
during
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes
it
has,
your
honor,
and
it's
been
decided
adversely
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
one
of
the
cases
was
the
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
oh,
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
it
was
raised
on
the
habeas
corpus
petition,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
pleaded
non
vult
to
the
crime.
i
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
he
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
thereafter,
he
instituted
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes,
your
honor,
he
went
on
the
merit.
well,
he
went
on
the
merits
but
the
supreme
court
did
not
hear
it
on
the
merits.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
an
adjudication.
it
was
adjudicated
by
the
essex
county
court
on
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
it
was
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
division.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
the
opinion,
i
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i
think
it
was
done
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
written
in
the
reports
as
i
recall.
there
was
--
there
was
a
decision
by
the
appellate
division.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
--
that
preceded
the
plea
of
non
vult.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
after
the
plea
of
non
vult,
there
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
decided
on
the
merits
of
the
county
court
reviewed
on
the
merits
by
the
appellate
division.
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i'm
not
sure
they
were
reported,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
i
relay
--
i
will
check
them
during
the
interval
that's
given
to
me
on
my
rebuttal
if
--
if
they're
in
the
brief.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
denied
it.
they
denied
a
petition
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
which
of
course
is
the
question
in
the
fay
case
now
before
this
court,
which
were
not
raised
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i
think
it
might
well
be,
your
honor.
this
court
has
made
the
distinction
that
in
certain
cases,
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
if
the
severity
is
of
a
sufficient
degree,
other
cases,
perhaps
that
right,
may
not
exist
and
i
think
the
same
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i'm
thinking
--
possibly
your
honor
--
i'm
thinking
particularly
the
uveges
case
where
--
it
was
emanated
that
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
right
in
every
case
for
(voice
overlap)
right.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
to
have
counsel
in
general,
not
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
same
distinction
might
be
made
that
in
--
the
more
--
where
the
penalty
is
more
severe,
the
right
to
counsel
might
exist
where
the
penalty
is
less
severe
might
not
exist.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
my
own
view
would
be
that
he
--
he
would
be,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far
in
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
--
deciding
this
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
and
i
would
submit
briefly
that
the
disadvantages
which
can
be
raised
against
such
a
rule,
such
a
right,
is
the
fact
that
criminal
detection
will
be
handicapped
and
i
think,
in
frankness,
that
must
be
admitted.
it
will
not
be
as
easy
to
obtain
convictions,
possibly
not
as
easy
to
obtain
evidence
if
the
right
to
interrogate
between
arrest
and
arraignment
is
curtailed.
i
would
also
submit
that
where
that
right
is
curtailed,
either
voluntarily
or
otherwise,
i
as
in
england
or
with
the
fbi,
criminal
prosecution
has
not
appeared
to
be
fatally
handicapped.
in
some,
the
--
this
objection
is
raised
to
every
advanced
and
criminal
rights
--
rights
for
an
accused.
every
--
every
right
is
resisted
while
the
statement,
law
enforcement
will
be
broken
down,
society
will
suffer
seriously
by
it
and
yet,
each
advance
is
made
without
substantial
detriment
to
the
public
or
to
law
enforcement.
i
would
submit
that
in
view
of
the
tremendous
advantages
in
fairness
to
the
accused
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
should
be
reversed.
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
nothing
more
subversive
of
law
enforcement
in
the
ultimate
sense
than
the
injustice
that
occurs
on
occasion
through
the
faulty
conviction
of
innocent
person.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
--
representative.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i
say
that
is
in
dispute.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
there's
no
finding
on
it,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know.
i
--
think
we
merely
have
the
record
of
his
testimony
where
he
says
that
he
did
request
an
attorney
and
the
--
of
the
state
testimony
that
he
did
not.
i
--
well,
i
--
i
would
submit
that
when
he
has
employed
an
attorney
prior
to
an
interrogation,
the
attorney's
job
is
to
get
to
see
a
client
and
he
is
acting
on
behalf
of
his
client
when
he
asks
to
see
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
your
honor.
he
--
he
went
on
the
basis
that
the
attorney
had
been
appointed
by
the
accused
and
his
family
and
had
tried
to
see
the
accused
during
this
period.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
as
i
understood
his
question,
your
honor,
the
finding
--
he
asked
me
if
there
was
a
finding
that
the
accused
had
requested
counsel.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
your
honor,
not
to
my
recollection.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
it
hasn't
been
raised,
your
honor.
it
hasn't
been
--
it
hasn't
been
considered
on
that
basis.
it's
considered
on
the
fact
that
the
accused
hired
an
attorney
and
the
attorney
attempted
to
see
the
accused
during
questioning.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
is
undisputed,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
perhaps
i
misstated
the
question,
your
honor,
because
we
have
been
--
i
have
been
trading
this
case
as
if
the
appointment
of
counsel
by
an
accused
and
the
attempt
of
that
counsel
to
do
his
job
is
to
see
the
accused
is
the
same
as
the
accused
asking
to
seek
counsel.
once
the
accused
had
retained
an
attorney,
the
attorney
is
speaking
for
the
accused
when
he
had
tried
to
see
his
client.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that's
page
--
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
no,
it's
based
on
undisputed
evidence,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
there
is
no
dispute,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
if
it
please
the
court,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
into
my
main
argument.
i
--
in
rebuttal
i
think
the
main
argument
covered
what
i
had
to
say.
i
did
want
to
add
--
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
as
to
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
of
new
jersey
in
this
case
on
appeal.
that
is
on
the
habeas
corpus
appeal.
that
opinion
was
not
reported.
it
was
by
stipulation
included
in
the
record
below.
judge
forman
found
--
this
is
on
page
14
of
the
record
that
the
appellate
division
decided
petitioner's
claim
of
denial
of
right
to
counsel
on
the
merits,
i
--
that's
to
hold
inferentially
at
least
that
there
is
no
taint
of
illegality
touching
that
confession.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
the
habeas
corpus,
yes.
that
is
true,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
and
it
would
be
in
--
in
the
record
on
this
case,
though
not
in
the
transcript
that
that
was
not
--
that
finding
was
not
disputed
or
it
was
not
an
issue.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
was
part
of
the
holding,
your
honor
and
then
the
court
went
ahead
to
decide
it
on
the
merits.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
your
honor,
the
--
as
judge
forman
found
below
the
court
did
rule
on
the
merits
and
therefore,
it
--
judge
forman
proceeded
on
the
merits
in
that
case.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
well,
your
honor,
as
i
--
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly
i
--
this
is
directed
to
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
and
the
--
i
--
i
was
--
my
answer
today
that
it
was
decided
on
the
merits
in
the
appellate
division
in
the
state
court.
i
--
it
was
--
then
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
where
it
was
--
a
review
was
not
granted
because
of
--
they've
declined
to
grant
a
petition
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
it
then
came
to
this
court
on
certiorari
which
was
denied.
and
therefore,
i
--
the
state
court
treated
it
as
if
it
were
in
time,
decided
it
on
the
merits
and
proceeded
on
that
basis.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
your
honor,
if
it
were
on
the
state
grounds
alone,
that
would
--
i
--
i
confess
you're
right.
that
would
bar
us
from
proceeding
further.
in
this
case,
we
submit
it
was
on
the
federal
ground
that
the
decision
was
decided
and
that
was
the
finding
of
the
federal
court
below.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
if
that
were
the
only
ground,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
decisions
to
that
effect.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
proceeded
on
the
merit.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
that's
correct.
mr.
dickinson
r.
debevoise
i
consider
an
honor
to
be
permitted
to
bring
the
case
here.
