justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
you
to
restate
that
last
sentence,
the
--
the
time,
would
you
mind
stating
the
time
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
up
to
that
time,
is
there
any
complaint
of
what
happened
after
that
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
you
--
are
you
going
to
go
in
to
this
in
detail
again?
i'd
like
to
have
ten
--
schedule
from
10
a.m.
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
debevoise,
am
i
right
in
inferring
that
you
are
arguing
the
points
that
you
are
arguing
as
though
the
case
had
come
up
here
directly
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
and
not
on
review
by
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
after
new
jersey
courts
got
through
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
drawing
that
inference
that
you
--
that
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
conviction
on
the
basis
of
violation
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
the
fact
that
this
comes
up
on
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
courts
after
the
state
courts
are
through
is
a
matter
of
no
moment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
thought
i
wanted
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
think
the
scope
of
review
of
a
federal
district
court
on
habeas
corpus
after
exhaustion
of
the
state
remedies
is
the
same
as
though
we
had
--
as
though
a
case
have
been
brought
here
on
certiorari
from
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
will
be,
but
i
think
there's
got
to
be
some
basis
unless
we
are
to
say,
we
are
to
assimilate
the
review
by
jurisdiction
on
habeas
corpus
as
the
equivalent
of
direct
review
by
way
of
certiorari
or
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that
but
whether
the
--
whether
the
--
whether
our
inquiry
is
the
same
as
though
we
had
no
problem
because
the
habeas
corpus
is
not
equivalent
of
a
direct
review
by
this
court.
it
seems
to
me,
that
raises
a
serious
question.
however,
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
restricting
this
contention
to
the
crime
in
issue,
in
this
case
murder,
are
you
--
are
you
urging
a
general
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you
have
to
assert
here
is
in
a
capital
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
may
i
interrupt
because
you're,
i'm
sure,
well
aware
of
the
fact
urging
of
a
very
far-reaching
raising
a
far-reaching
problem
in
this
case
and
i
wondered
if
you
--
before
you
sit
down,
indicate
precisely
what
the
rule
of
law
you're
urging.
is
it
to
be
specific
that
when
a
man
is
apprehended
and
in
--
under
detention,
charged
with
a
capital
offense,
the
police
may
ask
him
no
question
and
may
not
begin
any
questioning
at
all
except
in
the
presence
of
a
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
ask
you
to
--
to
be
still
more
specific
because
this
is
far-reaching
problem
that
you're
appreciated.
must
you
tell
him
--
must
you
ask
him
whether
he
wants
counsel?
must
you
or
are
you
--
your
case
request
for
counsel
and
denied,
it
was
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
what
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
when
did
questioning
begin
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
question
--
had
this
question
the
one
that
you're
presenting
then
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
--
the
only
question
you're
raising
here
that
you
are
raising
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
there
was
a
conviction,
was
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
happened
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
and
that's
your
procedure.
he
didn't
go
up
to
the
--
from
the
superior
court.
he
didn't
go
up
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
merits
on
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
--
so
there
is
no
adjudication
as
to
--
in
this
case,
on
this
question,
on
this
fact,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
an
opinion
of
the
essex
county
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
an
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
looking
for
your
state
decision
and
i
can't
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
question
--
there
was
a
litigation
on
suppression,
but
that's
outside
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
give
me
--
give
us
the
site,
the
references
to
the
reported
opinion
in
this
case
on
this
question
of
the
denial
of
a
right
to
counsel
in
the
course
of
the
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
that's
what
i
thought.
that's
what
i
--
that's
--
that
was
my
(inaudible)
mr.
debevoise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
forman
pass
on
taking
to
account
that
conflict,
did
he
do
anything
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
then
the
finding
is
--
then
--
then
why
did
you
not
answer
justice
whittaker's
question
that
there
was
a
finding
by
judge
forman
supporting
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
is
--
is
there
a
finding?
did
judge
forman
expressed
a
view
on
that
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
disputed
that
question
whether
he
did
or
didn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
undisputed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
this
petitioner's
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
just
now,
who
didn't
know
that
mr.
palmeiri
was
his
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
then
explaining
what
judge
forman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
-
what
the
statement
of
judge
forman
on
page
16
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
16,
one,
six.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
middle
of
the
page
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
was
petitioner
deprived
of
a
cherished-american
right,
the
right
to
see
a
lawyer,
but
the
dignity
of
the
legal
profession
itself
was
demeaned
when
the
police
and
an
assistant
prosecutor
arbitrarily
refused
to
permit
this
petitioner's
counsel
to
perform
the
traditional
role
of
the
lawyer
in
informing
an
accused
of
his
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
understand
that
statement
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
palmeiri
had
been
retained,
didn't
--
didn't
go
in
and
it
wasn't
a
crime
hunter
but
had
already
been
in
a
professional
relation
to
the
petitioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
but
the
lawyer
give
notice
to
the
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
norris.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
mr.
caruso,
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
what
you
said
in
reply
to
my
question
a
challenge
to
the
accuracy
of
what
judge
forman
said
on
page
16?
are
you
saying
that
judge
forman
was
not
entitled
to
make
that
statement
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
says
that
the
arbitrary
to
refuse
to
permit
his
petitioner's
counsel
to
perform
his
role
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well
now
are
you
--
do
i
gather,
am
i
to
infer
from
what
your
--
from
you
reply
if
you
say
judge
forman
was
not
entitled
on
this
record
to
make
that
statement,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
you're
not
respectful
to
him
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now
--
but
you
say
he
had
no
basis
for
saying
it,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
--
i
must
--
i
must
ask
you,
if
i
may.
judge
forman
says
not
that
the
petitioner
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
was
denied
getting
his
lawyer.
what
he
says
that
the
prosecutor
refused
to
permit
a
man
who
was
in
professional
relation,
who
was
this
petitioner's
lawyer
who
was
discharging
a
lawyer's
duty
to
his
client.
he
said,
“i
want
to
see
my
client
and
to
tell
him
what
his
rights
are”
and
that
he
was
forbidden,
he
was
refused
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
now,
are
you
saying
that
that
is
correct
or
are
you
challenging
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it
was
known
that
he
was
an
attorney
and
although
the
request
he
made
was
in
the
ordinary
and
almost
necessary
discharge
of
a
lawyer's
duty,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
for
whatever
legal
significance
it
has,
this
statement
of
judge
forman
i
may
take
as
--
as
not
challenged,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
on
behalf
of
new
jersey
why
--
how
you
justify
denying
to
a
fellow
your
assessment
up
for
a
serious
crime
access
to
or
rather
the
opportunity
for
his
lawyer,
to
have
access
to
his
client.
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
justification
for
that
in
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
rule
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
reason
is
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
whether
it's
more
or
less
convenient
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
that
ultimate
question,
whether
that
is
such
an
unfairness
that
it
may
be
challenged
under
the
fourteenth
--
under
the
due
process
clause
because
that's
the
only
question
we
have
here,
not
general
consideration
whether
it's
convenient
or
inconvenient,
desirable
or
undesirable
at
least
speaking
for
myself.
there's
an
ultimate
question
of
whether
this
come
forth
with
the
kind
of
treatment
that
anybody
you
and
i
would
like
to
have
under
similar
circumstances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you're
now
here
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
law
and
have
to
decide
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
why
i
am
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
were
in
jersey,
that
would
be
a
perfect
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
won't
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
won't
do
that
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
exactly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
entitled
to
"sshh"
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
entitled
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he's
entitled
to
keep
quiet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
he
entitled
to
keep
quiet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
didn't
see
him
until
you
got
through
with
him,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
until
you
got
through
with
him,
in
this
thing
that
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
have
it
to
be
--
to
be
afraid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
he
didn't
see
him
until
you
finished,
by
you
i
mean
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
lawful
--
the
law
enforcement
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
until
you
got
through
getting
out
of
him
what
you
wanted,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
appellate
division
that
came
here
on
certiorari
--
i
don't
need
to
feel
with
the
merits,
but
the
appeal's
benefit
throughout
the
appeal
is
not
perfected
and
--
and
that
is
it
was
perfected
out
of
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
i
understand
that.
but
if
it
was
out
of
time,
and
therefore,
that
would
be
an
end
of
the
matter.
how
can
it
--
what's
the
bearing
of
that
on
habeas
corpus
in
federal
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
he
did
that
but
i'm
asking
you
what
--
what
business
a
federal
court
has
to
deal
with
the
merits
of
--
of
appeal
in
the
state
court
which
was
out
of
time
it
to
have
been
passed
on
by
the
state
court,
which
you
could
had
been
in
time,
could
have
been
dealt
with
by
this
court
on
the
merits
as
of
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
correct.
that
is
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
treated
it
as
though
it
were
in
time.
my
point
is
that
if
a
state
court
denies
the
case
on
the
ground
which
rests
on
a
state
ground,
how
can
you
whip
the
devil
around
the
stump
and
then
say,
“well,
the
federal
court
can
assume
it
was
passed
on
the
merits.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
can
rest
on
a
state
ground,
we
can't
review
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
isn't
so.
if
a
state
decision
rests
on
both
the
federal
ground
and
the
state
ground
and
can
rest
on
the
state
ground,
then
we
cannot
review
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
decision.
you
think
that
there're
some
decisions
one
way
and
some
decisions
the
other
way.
insofar
as
i
know
there
are
no
decisions
here.
