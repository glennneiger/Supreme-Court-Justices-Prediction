justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
unclear
if
i
may
ask.do
you
contend
that
there
is
any
finding
on
the
conflicting
evidence
you
mentioned,
saying
that
petitioner
did
in
fact
request
a
lawyer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
a
finding
on
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
did
say,
as
i
understood
your
statement
of
the
question,
perhaps
i
didn't
correctly
understand
that
you
contend
that
an
accused
is
entitled
to
counsel
in
the
capital
case
between
the
period
of
arrest
and
arraignment
if
he
asks
the
counsel.
