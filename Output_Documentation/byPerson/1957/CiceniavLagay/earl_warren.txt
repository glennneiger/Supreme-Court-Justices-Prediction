state
prison
farm.
mr.

chief
justice
earl

do
you
believe
mr.
debevoise
that
there
is
a
legal
distinction
between
your
capital
case
and
non-capital
felony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
betts
versus
brady?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
have
counsel
or
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
none
of
those
cases
touch
this
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
was
constitutional
right,
why
wouldn't
any
man
accused
of
a
felony
be
entitled
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
decision
of
this
case.

that's
all

you.
mr.
caruso.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
doesn't
it
go
a
little
farther
than
that?
doesn't
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
it
go
a
little
farther
than
that?
doesn't
it
include
also
that
his
counsel
ask
to
see
him
and
was
not
permitted
to
see
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
is
not
in
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
also,
the
--
on
the
question
as
to
whether
--
whether
he
asked
for
counsel
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
--
may
i
--
may
i
just
interrupt
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
go
in
and
--
and
give
yourself
up?
was
there
--
was
he
requested
to
give
himself
up?
was
there
--
was
there
any
accusation
against
him
or
did
they
ask
him
to
come
and
talk
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
said
"go
and
give
yourself
up."
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
that's
all
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
is
it
to
newark?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment
there.
what
is
the
first
scene
that
happened
when
they
brought
cicenia
in
to
photograph
him
and
fingerprint
him
and
put
him
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
then
let
me
go
back,
if
your
honor's
please,
i
think
before
i
set
this
question
of
counsel
as
divided
into
two,
first,
whether
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
marr
questioned
him
before
he
gave
the
story?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
--
did
he
confess
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
he
--
that
wasn't
a
confession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this,
is
it
an
oral
statement
admitting
guilt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
is
it
a
denial
guilt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
that?
who
is
that
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
he
--
was
he
in
there
all
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
room
all
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
was
--
i
thought
he
was
examining
the
other
--
the
other
defendant,
norris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
norris
listening
to
this
entire
conversation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
your
position
--
it
is
your
position
in
the
case
that
the
police
can
arrest
a
man
in
this
matter
and
hold
him
as
long
as
they
want
while
they're
making
an
investigation
and
during
that
time,
they
may
refuse
admission
to
his
lawyer
to
see
him.
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
caruso.
chief
justice
earl
warren

don't
know

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
caruso.
mr.
debevoise,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
debevoise,
before
you
sit
down,

would
just
like
to
say

informed

into
this
case
by
assignment
of
the

in
the
lower
court.
chief

it
into
this
court?

justice
earl
warren
we're
very
grateful
to
you,
sir

always
comforted

are
willing
to
give
their
time
and
energy
in
defending
the
rights
of
an
impecunious
defendant.
so,
we
thank
you,
sir
