chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
what
way
of
acquiesce
--
just
by
asking
for
a
continuance
of
that
is
what
you
mean
or
do
it
express
acquiescence
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
how
it
lost
the
--
lost
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
what
date
to
what
date?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
as
i
understand
i
am
just
trying
to
get
the
sequence
mr.
phelps
in
my
mind,
the
order
was
originally
to
take
effect
on
the
7th
of
september
and
at
that
time
the
government
asked
to
have
it
continued
for
a
certain
length
of
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
done,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
request
was
you
say
in
the
form
of
an
acquiescence
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
now
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
that
under
state
law
they,
the
government
lost
the
right
to
review
the
order
of
the
court
by
not
having
appealed
from
the
september
7th
date.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
is
--
did
not
the
continuance
that
they
gave
until
some
time
in
december
detract
from
the
finality
of
that
judgments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
it
did
have
in
the
end
of
december
it
did
have
a
right
to
have
that
california
order
reviewed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record
during
the
briefs
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
where
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
davis
doesn't
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
self
executing
make
it
more
imperative
that
the
state
be
a
party
defendant
as
maryland
was
as
a
defendant
in
the
mcculloch
versus
maryland?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
in
any
case
then,
where
the
state
has
an
arm
of
its
government
to
enforce
its
laws,
is
it
sufficient
to
sue
just
the
officer,
if
it's
a
constable,
if
it's
a
constable
who
has
the
power
to
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
enforce
a
law
can
you
sue
the
constable
and
not
the
state
and
not
declare
the
act
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
peace
officer
and
peace
officers
have
certain
rights,
the
powers
of
enforcement
to
whether
constables,
sheriffs
or
highway
patrolmen
or
whoever
they
might
be.
now
if
that
is
the
arm
of
the
government
that
does
it,
would
it
be
sufficient
to
sue
the
constable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
only
because
the
act
is
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
their
conduct
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
line
of
cases
do
you
rely
on
to
substantiate
that
point
that
you
can
sue
only
the
enforcing
agency
in
order
to
establish
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act
when
they
have
done
nothing
to
go
beyond
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
say
enough,
what
cases
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
further
there's
been
no
final
acts
of
any
kind
by
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
the
truckers
testified
that
you
couldn't
disclose
to
the
commission
what
the
government
had
closed
to
them
without
endangering
the
security
of
the
nation?
was
that
the
–
what
had
been
testified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
was
the
–
that
was
one
of
the
three
things
that
they
had
testified
to
them,
these
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
last
case
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
maryland
was
a
party
to
that
action?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
possibly
if
you
just
give
us
the
list
of
your
authorities
and
do
it
quickly
so
we
could
counsel
while
he
is
here
so
they
have
an
opportunity
to
reply,
and
then
we
can
have
for
a
conference
on
it
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
thank
you.
judge
mckeage.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
urge
the
point
to
the
necessary
party,
the
state
being
a
necessary
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say
you
do
not
urge
it
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
judge
mckeage,
in
light
of
what
you
just
said,
i
think
there
is
no
reason
for
me
to
trouble
mr.
davis
or
you
further
about
a
point,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
you
can
forget
about
the
memorandum
that
mr.
davis
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
not
necessary.
