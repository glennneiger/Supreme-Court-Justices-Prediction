mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
court
please?
i
would
like
to
give
just
a
word
of
background
on
this
case.
historically,
the
united
states
has
been
free
to
negotiate
rates
about
transportation
of
its
property
throughout
the
history
of
the
country.
section
22
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
was
adopted
in
1887,
provided
the
specific
expectation
with
respect
to
interstate
traffic
as
such.
and
the
states
by
and
large
made
no
attempt
to
impose
regulations
on
intrastate
traffic
until
recently.
state
of
california
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i
say
and
the
states
made
no
attempt
to
impose
rates
upon
the
united
states
for
intrastate
traffic
until
very
recently.
california
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
intra
--
and
interstate
icc,
the
interstate
commerce
act
made
the
exemption.
in
california
that
we've
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
the
united
states
was
not
governed
by
any
rates
on
intrastate
or
interstate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
each
case.
in
california
for
example,
there
was
a
specific
provision
of
the
california
public
utility
code
giving
the
united
states,
exempting
the
united
states
from
the
power
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
rates.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
this
picture
changed?
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
california
yeah
the
change
in
the
law
was
made
in
1955,
generally
these
changes
occurred
within
the
last
five
to
six
years
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
--
there
has
been
some
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon,
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
but
i
would
mention
this,
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
as
to
the
general
government
transportation
policies.
and
there
was
a
concerted
movement
to
alter
or
amend
section
22
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
order
to
take
away
the
exception
with
respect
to
interstate
commerce.
congress
last
summer
turned
down
the
request.
of
course
there
would
be
no
constitutional
question
there
because
congress
governing
the
transport
would
be
able
to
subject
its
own
transportation
to
such
rates
as
it
desires.
but
as
a
matter
of
policy
congress
determined
last
summer
not
to
amend,
not
to
repeal
section
22
but
to
leave
the
united
states
free
of
the
regular
tariffs
for
the
transportation
of
its
own,
of
its
own
property.
that
was
as
recently
as
i
say
this
last
summer.
california
on
the
other
hand,
this
problem
became
acute
in
california
in
--
i
think
it
was
in
1954,
when
some
small
truckers
began
to
engage
in
what
the
established
trucking
companies
felt
was
cutthroat
competition.
they
were
cutting
their
rates
for
the
transportation
of
government
property
and
an
association
of
the
truckers
went
to
the
public
utility
commission
in
california
and
said,
we
need
protection
from
these
interlopers
that
are
destroying
our
business.
there
was
an
attempt
to
remedy
this
through
commission
action
and
when
that
proved
futile,
the
legislature
of
california
passed
the
law,
which
repealed
the
exemption
for
government
--
transportation
of
government
property
and
that's
the
section
which
is
now
before
this
court.
i
believe
it
is
unnecessary
by
and
large
to
go
into
the
administrative
proceedings
which
have
occurred
before
the
california
commission.
the
remedy,
if
it
was
a
remedy,
which
the
united
states
could
have
achieved
through
participating
in
those
proceedings,
was
only
a
partial
remedy.
section
530
of
the
public
utility
code
is
self
executing.
it
provides
that
--
it
provides
that
the
commission
may
permit
common
carriers
to
transport
property
at
reduced
rates
for
the
united
states
subject
to
such
extent
and
subject
to
such
conditions
as
it
may
consider
just
and
reasonable.
in
other
words,
the
provision
of
the
public
utility
code
is
self
executing.
unless
the
commission
grants
exception
from
it,
the
united
states
is
automatically
subject
to
the
regular
intrastate
rates
in
california.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
believe
not
your
honor.
the
act
as
i
say,
and
this
is
a
pure
question
of
statutory
construction
i
think,
the
commission
may
permit
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
law
that
i'm
reading,
yes,
this
is
the
section
of
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
quoted
down
in
our
brief
at
page
2,
under
530
of
the
california
public
utility
commission.
the
commission
may
permit
common
carriers
to
transport
the
property
at
reduced
rates
for
the
united
states,
state
county
and
municipal
governments,
to
such
extent
and
subject
to
such
conditions
as
it
may
consider
just
and
reasonable.
now
if
we've
got
everything
we
wanted
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
we'd
require
a
ruling
by
the
public
utility
commission
that
no
conditions
are
necessary
and
united
states
may
continue
to
act
as
it
has
in
the
past.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
may
not
do
it
with
respect
to
transportation
free
because
the
word
‘free'
was
dropped
out
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
transportation
of
property.
that
is
not
really
is
the
essence
of
our
case
because
we
don't
expect
that
before
the
free
examination
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
in
the
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
the
commission
could
grant
exceptions
presumably
it
could
grant
exceptions
in
every
case
where
we
ask
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
i
will
indeed
go
into
that.
but
first
i
want
to
suggest
to
this
court,
that
we
do
not
have
to,
we
do
not
have
to
consider
really
the
effect
of
this
commission
proceeding
to
alter
its
order
with
respect
to
permit
carriers
because
its
only
partial
relief.
the
act
is
there.
it
applies
except
with
respect
to
the
–
what's
carved
out
of
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
well
in
these
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
can
but
i've
said
--
in
the
proceeding
which
mr.
phelps
was
talking
about
they
were
dealing
only
with
part
of
the
relief
that
was
involved.
and
so
i
think
there
is
a
substantial,
suspiciously
substantial
amount
of
relief
which
isn't
involved
in
that
proceeding.
there
was
no
reason
that
the
united
states
should
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
the
problem
--
that
is
the
procedural
problem
which
is
before
this
court,
and
before
they
reach
the
merits
and
that
is
and
it's
stated
in
various
ways
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
stated
as
the
ground
--
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
comity,
stated
on
whether
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
before
that
court,
and
that's
specifically
the
first
question
which
this
court
must
face
up
to.
and
that
is
–
mr.
john
f.
davis
whether
this
is
ripe
for
decision.
now
i
don't
think
that
the
commission
argues
that
the
federal
government
must
wait
until
there
has
been
an
injury
to
the
united
states
through
the
disclosure
of
confidential
information
of
–
that
there
shall
have
been
delayed
in
military
shipments
or
that
these
other
injuries
which
were
alleged
to
be
in
prosect
and
with
result
–
i
don't
think
that
the
commission
argues
that
we
must
wait
until
those
specific
things
occur
before
we
can
get
relief
because
the
very
purpose
of
an
injunctive
proceeding
such
as
this
is
when
these
things
are
imminent,
when
they
arise
from
the
--
what
has
already
occurred
then
an
injunction
is
a
proper
remedy
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
very
frequently
the
actual
carriers
don't
know
what
they
are
carrying.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
high
security
cases
there
is
a
single
representative
of
the
truckers
who
has
been
cleared
for
confidential
information
and
the
armed
service
involved
negotiates
directly
with
him
and
tells
him
as
much
information
as
is
necessary
in
order
for
him
to
--
and
only
as
much
information
as
is
necessary
for
him
to
perform
the
transportation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
think
it
is
entirely
possible
we
could
make
such
a
condition
with
the
commission.
judge
mckeage
says
that
the
commission
--
obviously
the
commission
doesn't
want
to
harm
the
united
states
of
the
security.
but
i
say
we
shouldn't,
the
united
states
shouldn't
be
in
a
position
where
it
has
to
make
that
provision
with
them.
they
should
not
have
the
power,
the
authority
to
require
us
to
make
those
laws.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
not
your
honor
because
this
is
in
the
nature
of
an
injunctive
proceeding
and
that
proper
persons
that
we
wanted
to
get
the
injunction
against
are
the
persons
who
we're
going
to
enforce
this
statute
against
the
united
states,
which
i
believe
clearly
is
the
public
utilities
commission
in
california.
i
think
california
would
have
been
a
proper
party
in
this
case,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
necessary
party.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
not
--
the
commission
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it
is
the
arm
of
the
state
which
is
established
to
enforce
this
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
i
say
since
the
form
of
this
procedure
is
the
injunctive
procedure,
i
do
not
believe
the
state
is
a
necessary
party.
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
proper
party.
i
don't
think
it's
a
jurisdictional
party.
i
don't
think
that
there
can
be
no
case
without
the
state
being
in.
you
can
see
we're
not
trying
to
enjoin
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
california,
the
governor
of
the
california
or
united
states
attorney
in
california.
we're
trying
to
enjoin
the
particular
arm
of
california
which
is
established
to
do
these
things.
now
if
the
legislature
had
no
power
to
pass
the
law,
the
law
is
a
nullity,
the
commission
is
acting
without
proper
authority
and
therefore
can
be
enjoined,
that's
the
--
the
theory
of
it
is
that
they
have
no
real
authority
to
act
because
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
the
real
basis
that
the
public
utility
commission
raises
this
jurisdictional
point
is
because
of
the
actions
of
this
court
in
such
cases
as
public
service
commission
of
utah
against
wycoff
and
then
two
or
three
years
ago
a
case
involving
the
same
public
utility
commission
in
connection
with
the
united
airlines
cases,
and
in
those
this
court
said
that
the
particular
agency
hadn't
attempted
to
bring
the
shipper
within
its
jurisdiction
and
it
was
too
early
to
try
to
enjoin
the
action,
until
the
commission
involved
had
decided
whether
or
not
the
shipper
was
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
now
this
case
is
different
in
more
than
one
way.
for
one
thing
there
is
no
question
of
interpretation,
there's
no
power
in
the
commission,
not
to
take
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states.
the
act
itself,
there
was
the
exception
in
the
act,
with
respect
to
united
states
and
the
legislature
repealed
the
exception
so
that
the
statute
is
specifically
now
subject
--
applicable
to
property
carried
for
the
united
states.
so
we
don't
have
to
go
back
to
the
particular
commission
in
order
for
them
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
applicable
to
this
carriage.
now
that
was
the
case
in
pennsylvania
and
in
texas
where
we
have
these
similar
questions,
and
we
have
in
those
cases
gone
to
the
state
courts
in
order
to
get
that
state
question
resolved,
but
here
there
is
no
such
question.
now
the
second
reason
that
this
is
different
from
the
wycoff
cases
and
the
public
service
commission
against
united
airlines
is
that,
in
this
case
the
act
is
self
executing
and
that
no
order
of
the
commission
is
necessary
in
order
to
have
these
effects
which
we
feel
are
so
harmful
to
the
united
states.
the
day
after
this
act
becomes
effective,
the
united
states
would
have
to
pay
the
tariffs
set
by
the
public
utility
commission
of
california
and
would
have
to
ship
subject
to
their
regulations
until
they
got
an
exception.
so
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
might
be
retrospective,
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
i
think
they
might
be
able
to
make
it
retrospective,
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
might
not
be
out
of
pocket.
i
think
that
it
is
unrealistic.
legally
speaking
we
might
be
--
not
be
out
of
pocket.
actually
the
purpose
of
passing
this
law
and
giving
the
commission
this
authority
was
because
there
was
a
feeling
that
we
were
taking
advantage
of
cut
rate
transportation
and
they
wanted
to
change
that
situation.
so
if
the
commission
carries
out
the
mandate
of
the
california
legislatures,
it
will
cost
us
some
money,
maybe
it
should
cost
us
some
money,
maybe
it
shouldn't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
recurs
throughout
this
case,
that
whenever
the
commission
is
pushed
to
the
point
where
it
appears
that
their
authority
might
damage
the
defense
effort.
the
commission
quickly
takes
the
position
we
will
not
abuse
our
discretion
in
this
respect.
we
will
respect
the
secrecy.
we
will
provide
rules
so
that
there
will
be
no
violation
of
secrecy.
with
respect
to
making
rates
retroactively,
we
will
advice
that
it
can
be
retroactive.
with
respect
to
prosecution
of
government
officials,
we
will
not
prosecute
government
officials
in
this
case
whether
we
have
power
or
not.
now
this
is
an
echo
of
the
position
taken
by
counsel
for
the
state
of
maryland
in
mcculloch
against
maryland.
there
the
statement
was
made
why
should
you
assume
that
we're
going
to
abuse
this
authority
to
tax.
everybody
says
the
powers
to
tax
involves
the
power
to
destroy
and
maybe
it
does,
but
we
are
as
patriotic
as
anybody
else
and
we
are
not
going
to
abuse
the
power
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
imposed
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
was
stated
that
they
could
--
that
was
the
argument
made
to
this
court
that
we
can
use
this
taxing
power
so
that
it
will
not
hinder
the
government
in
carrying
out
its
function.
now
i
submit
that
chief
justice
marshall
was
quite
right
when
he
said
that
if
someone
has
to
restrain
himself,
when
the
two
sovereigns,
whenever
you
get
one
of
these
problems
with
the
two
--
conflicts
between
the
two
sovereigns
and
one
has
to
take
into
consideration
the
perfectly
reasonable
purposes
and
function
to
the
other,
one
should
restrain
himself.
then
under
our
federal
system
it
isn't
for
the
california
commission
to
say
we
are
going
to
restrain
ourselves.
we're
not
going
to
act
improperly
in
this
case.
rather
under
our
constitutional
system
and
i'm
getting
into
the
merits
here,
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
made
the
supreme
government
when
there
is
a
conflict
and
its
for
the
united
states
to
say,
well
we'll
change
our
policy
with
respect
to
the
intrastate
transportation
in
california
and
we'll
try
to
injure
your
local
interest.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right,
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
excuse
me
your
honor,
maryland
was
the
plaintiff
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
as
i
think,
they
brought
the
action.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
do
not
see
your
honor
why
it
is
essential
that
the
state
as
a
state
be
made
a
party,
if
we
make
a
party
in
this
case
the
arm
of
the
state
which
is
responsible
for
this
particular
function
of
the
state
and
as
i
understand
from
mr.
mckeage
they
have
full
authority,
criminal
and
everything
else
with
respect
to
the
execution
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
in
enough
about
the
california
practice
nor
the
powers,
but
generally
speaking,
of
course
it
isn't
enough
to
just
pick
anybody
down
the
line
and
make
him
the
defendant
in
the
case.
frequently
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
if
acted
directly
under
authority
of
the
statute
and
he
was
the
man
responsible
to
the
legislature
in
effect,
because
the
legislature
gave
him
this
authority
to
act,
to
perform
without
direction
from
others
that
he
would
be
the
first
--
there
are
many
suits
involving
governments
where
you
do
sue
the
arm.
the
common
example
of
course
has
been
tax
litigation
where
we
have
so
commissioner
cases
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
have
to
pass
that.
i
think
it's
a
public
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
so,
except
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
assumed
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
just
--
it
occurs
to
me
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
the
chief
justice
are
entirely
right
that
the
state
of
california
has
an
interest
in
this
and
would
have
been
a
property
party.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
no
one
could
have
criticized
the
government
for
bringing
california
in,
but
i
submit
that
particularly
in
testing
constitutionality,
when
you
are
suing
someone
for
acting
improperly
because
it
has
no
authority,
because
the
act
is
a
nullity.
in
this
case
the
person
who
was
acting
improperly
if
we
are
right,
because
the
act
is
a
nullity
is
the
commission,
and
that's
why
we
sue
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
if
the
act
is
constitutional
why
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
that's
the
historic
way
that
you
test
the
constitution,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
united
states
where
you
can't
sue
the
united
states
without
permission,
why
they
have
suits
against
the
secretary
or
interior
or
and
the
other
cabinet
offices
on
the
ground
that
you're
suing
them
because
they
have
no
authority
to
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
i
may
have
misspoken
myself.
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
could
sue
only
the
commission,
the
public
utility
commission
and
not
(inaudible).
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
it
is
enough
if
you
sue
them.
i
think
it
would
have
been
quite
proper
to
have
joined
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
line
of
cases
that
i
would
rely
on
would
be
the
--
i'm
sorry
that
none
of
them
come
to
my
mind
at
this
moment
during
the
argument,
but
the
line
of
cases
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
this
point
is
not
raised,
in
their
there
has
been
no
question.
well
maybe
it
was
raised
way
below,
but
it's
not
raised
in
their
present
brief
and
we
haven't
briefed
it
before
this
court.
i'd
be
glad
to
submit
a
brief
on
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
would
think
it
certainly
would
have
--
it
would
be
--
would
influence
on.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
your
honor,
this
is
the
basic
theory
on
which
many
suites
against
federal
officials
are
brought,
and
they
are
done
in
that
way
in
the
case
of
the
federal
government
because
of
lack
of
power
to
sue
the
government
of
course,
but
the
whole
theory
of
them
is
that
the
person
being
unauthorized
is
subject
to
sue.
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
mckeage
in
his
reply
brief
argued
that
the
commission
does
have
judicial
power
and
i
think
it's
entirely
consistent
with
the
powers
of
california
and
to
give
it
judicial
power
if
it
wishes
to,
i
don't
know.
i
mean
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
important
to
this
case
whether
they
have
judicial
power
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know,
i
have
no
idea
whether
they
are
a
court
under
california
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
say
--
i
cannot
see
that
it
makes
a
difference
to
this
case,
whether
they
have
judicial
powers
or
not.
there
is
no
question
they
have
administrative
powers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
but
may
i
make
a
little
correction
mr.
justice
whittaker,
it
comes
not
from
an
order
of
the
california
commission.
it
comes
from
an
order
of
the
three
judge
district
court
setup
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
section
530
of
the
california
code,
but
there
has
been
no
determination
by
any
california
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well
the
commission
was
enjoined
before
the
act
became
effective.
i
mean
the
act
would
become
effective
by
its
terms
and
the
day
before
it
was
--
this
would
have
become
effective,
why
they
said
it
was
a
restraining
order.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
after
a
five-day
trial
before
a
three-judge
district
court
in
california
at
which
detailed
testimony
was
taken
as
to
the
effect
of
this
statute
on
the
transportation
facilities
of
the
armed
services.
the
government
presented
i
think
12
witnesses,
most
of
whom
were
officers
involved
in
the
day
to
day
transportation
of
government
property
for
the
armed
services.
and
they
testified
as
to
how
being
subject
to
the
california
commission
code,
how
that
would
effect
their
transportation
problems.
and
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
say
that
they
were
unanimous
in
finding
that
it
would
effect
the
government
--
armed
services
transportation
in
three
ways.
one,
it
would
cause
extensive
delays
in
preparing
for
particular
shipment
and
this
was
pointed
out
not
generally,
but
by
taking
specific
shipment
and
showing
what
kind
of
paperwork
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
meet
the
california
requirement.
the
second
suggestion
was
that
it
would
materially
endanger
the
security
of
these
shipments
and
the
third
suggestion
was
that
it
would
very
materially
increase
the
cost
of
these
shipments.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
these
finding
help.
to
be
sure
judge
--
the
chief
justice
marshall
said
that
--
made
it
clear
that
any
authority
would
be
sufficient
to
make
a
statement
--
the
imposition
of
a
state
control
unconstitutional.
i
think
there
has
been
some
withdrawal
from
that
position
and
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
whether
or
not
this
is
incidental
or
minor
or
whether
this
is
something
which
will
really
impair
and
be
dangerous
to
the
defense
therefore.
in
any
event
that
was
the
theory
on
which
the
case
was
tried
and
the
district
judge,
rather
the
circuit
judge
speaking
for
the
three-judge
district
court
made
specific
findings
as
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
from
the
cross-examination
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
this
law
upon
these
shipments.
therefore,
we
don't
merely
have
a
straight
case
of,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
mcculloch
against
marshall
where
on
the
theory
of
mcculloch
against
marshall
where
the
court
said
this
a
federal
power.
the
state
may
not
touch
upon
it
at
all.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
small,
large,
they
just
can't
touch
it.
here
we
have
a
case
of
real
evidence
showing
that
this
–
the
effect
of
this
would
be
material.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
both
in
an
economic
and
in
an
operational
sense
if
you
want
to
put
it
in
that
way.
mr.
john
f.
davis
delay
and
disclosure
of
security
information
and
third
was
economic
matter
of
expense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
there
was
testimony
by
the
truckers
to
that
effect.
the
testimony
–
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i'm
again
speaking
of
the
transportation
officials
of
the
armed
services
who
have
made
this
–
gave
the
testimony
and
what
they
testified
was
that
with
respect
to
security
shipment
present
time,
they're
handled
through
a
single
representative
of
the
carriers
who
is
given,
who
is
examined
and
found
to
be
cleared
and
then
he
is
given,
i
think
the
term
is
‘such
information
as
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
shipment.'
actually
they
sometimes
misdescribe,
misdescribe
the
treat
the
property
which
is
being
shipped.
they
ship
it
in
a
–
and
i
know
i'm
talking
from
the
record
and
they
ship
it
in
the
circuitous
route
so
that
nobody
can
tell
where
it
is
going
to
arrive.
and
this
is
done
--
and
apparently
it
is
done
often
–
it
is
done
when
securities
matters
are
involved
in
order
to
secure
this
information
from
enemy
sources.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
it
is
under
the
--
under
the
present
code
you
couldn't
get
intrastate
rates
without
making
these
disclosures.
it
is
–
the
commission
i
suggest
or
mr.
mckeage
suggests,
the
commission
has
authority,
if
you
please,
to
give
relief
in
that
situation
but
until
they
give
relief,
the
application
of
the
statute
would
prohibit
this
kind
of
thing.
now
the
question
is
should
the
armed
service
be
–
should
they
have
to
rely
on
relief
to
be
given
to
them
by
a
state
agency
in
a
matter
of
national
defense.
and
the
theory
of
the
government's
case
is
that
congress
has
said
that
in
matters
of
national
defense,
these
matters
of
judgment
shall
be
handled
by
the
federal
government
and
not
by
the
states.
and
it
does
involve
the
question
of
judgment
as
to
what
kind
of
relief
you
will
give
in
a
situation
–
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
many
of
the
cases
dealing
with
governmental
immunities,
the
conflict
between
the
two
sovereigns
have
said
that
where
the
imposition
of
the
control
is
not
direct
and
where
the
result
is
only
an
increased
cost,
then
the
state
shall
have
the
power
to
do
it.
i
know
of
no
case
that
says
that
where
the
imposition
is
directly
on
the
united
states,
as
i
believe
it
is
in
this
case,
where
there
is
any
statement
that
the
state
shall
be
able
to
impose
the
additional
expense
on
the
federal
government,
the
tax
cases
are
cases
where
they
tax
agencies
of
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
eventually
has
to
pay,
but
there's
for
example
no
case
saying
that
you
can
tax
the
united
states
even
though
it's
a
nondiscriminatory
tax.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
by
an
agency
if
it
is
a
commission,
but
if
it's
a
contracting
party
and
if
it
is
nondiscriminatory
then
this
court
has
said
that
kind
of
economic
burden
is
what
we
have
to
pay
for
living
in
a
country
where
we
have
two
branches
of
government.
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
our
position
that
the
imposition
is
directly
on
the
united
states
and
whatever
economic
burden
is
therefore
whether
discriminatory
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
certainly
the
theory
of
mcculloch
against
maryland.
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because
i
think
that
we
do
have
ample
evidence
as
to
the
extent
of
the
increased
part.
in
the
governmental
cases
i
think
that
it
helps
to
analyze,
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
government
immunity
situation,
which
i
think
is
involved
here,
that
is
state
imposing
its
will
on
a
government
function.
and
the
supremacy
of
federal
legislation
which
is
given
by
article
6
of
the
constitution,
which
says
that
–
when
congress
passes
a
law
and
the
state
lawyer
is
in
conflict,
any
state
lawyer
in
conflict
with
it,
it
must
give
way,
they
are
two
lines
of
cases,
i
think
this
can
be
decided
under
either
of
these
lines
and
i
think
primarily
this
is
a
case
of
the
governmental
immunity.
this
is
a
matter
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
impose
its
will
on
a
function
which
congress
has
given
to
congress.
and
this
isn't
a
question
of
finding
inconsistencies
between
congressional
action,
congressional
statutes
and
state
statutes
but
rather
it's
the
basic
question
of
the
state
imposing
its
will
on
a
defense
function.
but
if
you
want
to
take
the
narrow
type
of
case,
the
kind
of
case
that
was
involved
last
term
in
miller
against
arkansas,
even
there
we
find
that
there's
a,
what
i
believe
to
be
a
conflict,
between
the
state
regulation
and
the
federal
regulation
and
in
that
–
if
that
is
so
by
then
article
6
of
the
constitution,
the
federal
regulation
must
prevail.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
killing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know
how
much
authority
was
given
to
the
commission
–
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
about
four
of
these
cases
we
might
have
in
mind
along
this
line
and
maybe
it
will
be
worthwhile
to
look
them
just
briefly.
mayo
against
the
united
states
was
a
case
where
the
federal
government
was
sending
fertilizer
into
florida
in
an
attempt
build
up
the
nitrogen
in
the
soil.
and
state
of
florida
proceeded
to
impose
an
inspection
and
tax
a
inspection
by
examining
the
fertilizer
which
the
federal
government
sent
into
florida
in
order
to
find
out
whether
the
fertilizer
was
the
kind
of
thing
it
was
supposed
to
be.
no
here
i
have
no
idea
whether
florida
had
any
authority
not
to
examine
this
fertilizer.
i
would
guess
the
--
administratively
they
could
have
failed
to
examine
that
if
they
wanted
to.
johnson
against
maryland
is
a
case
of
whether
or
not
maryland
could
impose
a
license
provision
on
a
driver
of
the
united
states
mail
truck.
now
i
presume
that
the
laws
of
maryland
require
all
drivers
on
the
road
to
be
licensed
and
that
they
don't
give
any
authority
to
not
to
license
people.
hunt
against
the
united
states
involved
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
johnson
against
maryland
was
the
license
case--
mr.
john
f.
davis
maryland
was
a
party
to
that
action,
yes.
i
am
not
sure,
i
think
maryland
in
that
case
was
again
the
moving
party
although
i
am
not
sure
your
honor.
i
don't
remember
the
way
it
came
up,
i
don't
remember.
oleomargarine
case
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
mentioned
i
don't
know
whether
they
had
any
powers
of
making
exemption
or
not.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
then
there
was
the
case
of
the
forest
rangers
out
in
the
grand
canyon
national
park
who
found
that
the
deer
were
eating
up
the
foliage
and
they
first
tried
to
transport
them
out
of
the
park
and
to
limit
them
in
various
ways.
and
finally
the
only
way
to
handle
the
situation
was
to
kill
them
and
there
was
an
attempt
by
the
game
officials
of
the
state
of
arizona
to
prevent
these
officials
from
carrying
out
their
duties.
in
that
case
i
don't
know
whether
they
had
any
discretion
or
not,
i
assume
they
had
certain
amount
of
discretion.
getting
back
to
the
question
of
conflict,
conflict
between
the
state
regulatory
provisions
and
the
federal
regulatory
provisions,
generally
speaking
procurement
by
the
armed
services
is
carried
out
through
competitive
bidding,
but
section
--
but
chapter
10
of
the
united
states
code
gives
discretion
to
make
the
purchases
through
negotiations
in
those
situations
where
it
isn't
practical
to
fit.
each
of
the
--
well
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
various
secretaries
of
each
of
the
services
are
given
authority
to
make
regulation
with
respect
to
their
procurement.
and
we
cite
in
the
brief
and
i
won't
attempt
to
read
them
but
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
particular
regulations
which
contemplate
that
each
of
the
services
will
negotiate
a
price
with
carriers
for
the
transportation
of
goods
in
those
state
cases
where
they
find
that
the
established
rates
are
not
economical.
i
suggest
that
here
we
have
then
a
direct
conflict
between
a
california
law
which
says
carriage
of
goods
for
the
armed
services
shall
be
subject
to
the
rates
on
file
with
the
commission
and
a
provision
in
these
regulations
which
provides
specifically
that
they
shall
be
negotiated.
and
so
i
think
that
to
summarize
what
i
have
tried
to
say
i
think
we
have
here
a
case
which
is
ripe
for
decision
because
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
statute
which
becomes
effective
without
any
order
by
the
commission.
this
would
be
effective
except
for
the
restraining
order
and
would
have
a
deleterious
effect
upon
transportation
of
government
unless,
unless
the
california
commission
sees
fit
in
its
judgment
to
relieve
the
united
states
of
that
burden.
if
that
is
so
i
suggest
that
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
the
whole
framework
of
the
relationship
between
the
federal
and
state
governments
must
be
that
when
judgment
must
be
exercised
to
avoid
one
of
these
conflicts,
it
must
be
the
restraint
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
not
a
restrain
on
the
part
of
the
state
government.
may
i
ask
--
would
the
court
decide
that
i
file
a
brief
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
california
being
a
party,
it
isn't
covered
at
all
in
my
brief
and
i'd
be
anxious
to
file
it
if
the
court
--
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i
will
be
glad
to
get
it
done
in
time,
so
he
can
reply
and
so
that
it
can
be
ready
for
the
conference.
