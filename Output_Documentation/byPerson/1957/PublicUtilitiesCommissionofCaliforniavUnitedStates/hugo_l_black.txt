do
you
think
ex
parte
young
has
an
influence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
–
did
the
government
repeat
--
objected
to
this
state
judicial
agency
against
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
statute
says
that
the
commission
may
permit
railroads
to
carry
(inaudible)
the
word
may
permit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
commission
does
–
has
not
permitted
the
government
(inaudible)
tomorrow,
the
railroad
will
need
to
give
them
a
reduced
rate,
below
(inaudible)
would
anybody
be
suggested
to
punishment
of
violating
this
law,
the
law
that's
giving
you
these
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
though
that
would
be
in
effect
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
act
have
any
other
purpose
except
to
decide
what
rate
the
railroad
must
charge
--
justice

black
--
disposition
of
the
act
have
any
purpose
but
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
any
other
purpose
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
but
if
you
are
right
what
you
are
saying
is
that
a
state,
not
the
federal
government,
has
the
power
to
fix
the
rates
federal
government
must
pay
for
its
transportation
within
in
the
state
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
premise
on
which
the
statute
is
based?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asserting
here
that
the
statute
could
be
construed
in
a
way,
which
would
simply
say
that
the
agency
had
the
power
to
negotiate
with
the
government
recognizing
the
government's
superior
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
lies
within
its
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
not
the
government
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
gets
down
to
a
conflict
on
that
basis,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
are
right
on
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
exclusion
could
be
drawn
and
maybe
they
would
fix
rates
on
such
a
standard
that
the
government
would
be
willing
to
face
them
and
there
would
be
no
conflict?
