mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
with
the
court's
permission
i
should
like
to
take
approximately
half
of
the
appellant's
time
to
open
and
my
colleague
judge
mckeage
would
like
to
have
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
that
judgment
declared
unconstitutional
a
statute
of
the
state
of
california
and
permanently
enjoined
the
public
utilities
commission,
the
appellant
here,
from
taking
any
action
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
that
statute.
this
case
presents
two
major
aspects.
the
first
is
one
i
may
call
a
preliminary
or
threshold
or
jurisdictional
question,
involving
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
court
should
have
entertained
the
complaint
and
then
second
is
what
i
may
call
the
ultimate
question,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
california,
through
the
commission,
had
the
power
to
regulate
the
rates
of
commercial
carriers
for
the
transpiration
of
property
of
the
united
states.
this
matter
had
its
inception
in
1954.
in
order
to
make
clear
a
number
of
questions
that
arise
under
this
preliminary
aspect
of
the
case,
i
should
like
to
describe
as
briefly
as
i
can
the
statutory
and
administrative
framework
under
which
commercial
carriers
are
regulated
by
the
commission
in
california.
for
our
present
purposes
and
in
order
to
simplify
the
matter,
i
think
we
may
consider
carriers
in
california
as
in
two
categories.
in
the
one,
we
have
the
rails
and
the
so
called
certificated
motor
carriers
which
are
operating
under
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
by
the
commission
and
we
can
call
these
the
public
utility
carriers,
because
under
california
law
they
are
public
utilities
for
all
purposes
of
that
law.
they
are
required
to
file
tariffs
and
with
certain
exceptions
they
are
required
to
assess
and
collect
no
other
than
that
tariff
rate.
in
the
other
category,
there
are,
what
you
may
call
permit
carriers,
they
are
so
called
in
california.
there
are
thousands
of
them.
they
operate
under
mere
permits
issued
by
the
commission
and
their
rates
are
regulated
in
california
by
certain
minimum
rate
orders
promulgated
by
the
commission
from
time
to
time.
so
that
these
permit
carriers
are
required
to
assess
no
less
than
these
minimum
rates.
now
although
we
have
these
categories
of
carrier,
and
they
are
regulated
somewhat
differently,
they
compete
with
each
other
vigorously
for
all
kinds
of
traffic,
including
the
traffic
of
the
united
states
government.
for
many
years
it's
been
the
commission's
policy
to
equalize
the
conditions
under
which
these
two
classes
of
carriers
compete
with
one
another.
for
many
years
prior
to
1955,
section
530
of
the
public
utilities
code,
any
provision
the
effect
of
which
was
to
grant
to
these
public
utility
carriers
an
unlimited
right
to
transport
property
of
the
united
states
and
other
governments,
free
or
at
reduced
rates,
a
provision
comparable
to
section
22
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now
in
order
to
give
the
permit
carrier
the
same
privilege
the
commission,
a
number
of
years
ago,
incorporated
in
certain
of
its
minimum
rate
orders,
a
provision
authorizing
these
permit
carriers
to
deviate
from
the
minimum
rates,
for
the
transportation
of
property
for
the
armed
forces,
that's
very
important,
to
bear
in
mind
that
limitation.
that
provision
was
item
20
in
minimum
rate
tariff
number
2,
promulgated
by
the
commission
applicable
to
general
commodities,
not
all
but
so
called
general
commodities.
now
in
1954,
a
group
of
carriers,
who
had
been
transporting
large
quantities
of
property
for
the
united
states
government,
filed
with
the
commission
a
petition
and
that
is
where
this
matter
had
its
inception.
that
petition
alleged
that
due
to
the
intense
competition
of
carriers
for
government
business,
the
rates
for
that
business
had
deteriorated
to
the
point
where
the
revenues
of
the
carriers
were
depressed
to
unreasonably
low
levels
and
there
was
a
threat
of
a
burden
upon
other
traffic,
that
petitioner
requested
the
commission
to
take
appropriate
action.
the
action
that
these
carriers
requested
of
the
commission
was
the
cancellation
of
that
item
20
provision.
later
by
amendment
that
request
was
modified
into
a
request
merely
that
the
commission
authorized
permit
carriers
to
deviate
from
the
minimum
rates
only
to
meet
the
rate
of
a
public
utility
carrier
that
had
been
filed
with
the
--
some
agency
of
the
united
states
government
in
order
to
give
the
permit
carriers
the
benefit
of
knowledge
of
what
these
other
rates
were.
the
commission
found
as
facts
substantially
all
of
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner.
the
remedy
which
the
commission
sought
to
accomplish,
however,
was
a
remedy
which
required
the
cooperation
of
the
united
states
government
and
by
cooperation
i
mean
the
commission's
order
contemplated
that
the
united
states
government
would
require
these
public
utility
carriers
to
file
with
the
commission,
simply
for
the
sake
of
giving
publicity
these
reduced
rate
tenders
which
they
had
filed
with
various
agencies
of
the
united
states
government.
so
the
commission's
action
and
its
proposed
remedy
was
conditioned
upon
that
action
by
the
government.
later
on
the
commission
was
formally
advised
that
the
united
states
government
had
declined
to
require
the
publishing
and
the
filing
of
these
reduced
rate
tenders
with
the
commission.
the
commission's
attempt
to
remedy
therefore
became
a
futility.
in
the
middle
of
1955,
therefore,
the
california
legislature
enacted
an
amendment
to
section
530
of
public
utilities
code,
the
effect
of
which
was
to
withdraw
from
the
public
utility
carriers,
this
previously
enjoyed
unlimited
right
to
transport
for
the
government
free
or
at
reduced
rates
and
empowered
the
commission
to
permit
such
transportation,
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
it
saw
fit.
there
was,
however,
an
important
proviso
attached
to
that
amendment,
a
proviso
that
had
the
effect
of
partially
restoring
its
privilege
so
to
speak
to
the
utility
carriers
in
order
to
enable
them
to
meet
whatever
reduced
rate
might
be
authorized
to
the
permit
carriers.
that
amendment
was
to
become
effective
on
september
7th
1955.
now
on
august
16th
1955
the
commission
in
anticipation
of
that
september
7th
date
and
realizing
that
the
statute
would
be
defeated
in
large
measure
unless
and
until
the
commission
canceled
this
item
20
provision
to
the
permit
carriers.
on
august
16th
the
commission
issued
a
decision
which
canceled
item
20.
ten
days
later
on
august
26th
at
a
time,
and
this
is
important,
when
the
commission's
action
canceling
that
privilege
to
the
permit
carriers
could
have
been
stayed
by
the
united
states
until
its
rights
had
been
finally
determined
by
this
court,
instead
it
acquiesced
in
the
commission's
cancelation
of
that
privilege
and
merely
requested
a
postponement
of
90
days
of
its
effect.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
i
use
the
word
â€˜acquiescence'
to
describe
what
i
think
is
the
effect
of
it.
there
were
representations
in
the
petition
filed
by
the
government
requesting
postponement
which
had
the
effect
i
submit
of
being
an
acquiescence.
they
stated
for
example
that
the
united
states
could
make
the
necessary
arrangements
within
90
days,
that
they
believed
that
it
could
be
done
in
a
short
time,
that
they
believe
they
could
within
that
period
of
time
reach
agreement
upon
rates
that
would
be
satisfactory
to
the
commission
and
to
the
parties.
the
united
states
thereby
i
submit
your
honors
lost
its
right
to
a
state
and
waived
its
right
to
state
of
the
commission's
actions.
on
september
6th,
that's
the
day
before
september
7th
the
effective
date
of
the
statute,
the
commission
did
postpone
the
cancelation
of
item
20
for
a
period
of
90
days
as
requested
by
the
government,
so
that
the
cancellation
was
deferred
until
december
5,
1955.
now
september
7th
then
arrived
the
following
day
and
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
on
that
date,
september
7th,
the
united
states
waived
and
lost
its
right
to
a
judicial
review
under
california
law
of
the
commission's
act.
it's
also
important
to
your
honors
--
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
its
right
to
review
under
california
law
was
conditioned
upon
its
having
applied
to
the
commission
for
a
rehearing
of
this
decision
on
or
before
the
effective
date
of
the
decision.
now,
on
the
same
date
of
september
7th
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
for
certain
classes
of
government
traffic
this
section
530
of
the
statute
as
amended
became
effective.
now
those
classes
of
traffic
are
these,
all
traffic
in
all
commodities
for
all
of
the
civilian
agencies
of
the
united
states
government,
the
veterans
administration,
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
the
general
services
administration
and
others.
it
also
become
effective
upon
certain
kinds
of
armed
forces
traffic
that
is
to
say
traffic
in
certain
so
called
special
commodities
other
than
general
commodities,
petroleum,
live
stock,
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
for
example.
later
the
government
requested
a
further
postponement
by
60
days
of
the
commission's
action.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
that
was
about
10
days
your
honor
before
the
december
5th
that
was
november
27
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
i
believe
that's
a
fair
interpretation
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
well
yes
your
honor
i
should
have
made
that
more
clear.
what
the
government
lost
was
its
right
to
review
or
to
seek
review
as
of
that
time
of
the
commission's
cancellation
as
it
was
--
as
it
was
done
by
the
commission's
prior
order.
but
it
is
true
the
government's
request
for
a
postponement
that
was
granted
by
the
commission
then
deferred
to
a
later
date,
the
effective
date
of
the
cancellation
and
gave
rise
to
a
further
opportunity
for
the
government
to
seek
review
of
that
order.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes,
yes
your
honor,
it
did.
now
on
december
2,
that's
the
date
this
compliant
was
filed,
the
situation
was
then
that
the
government
who,
i
should
--
i
said
a
moment
ago,
had
participated
through
out
these
proceedings
before
the
commission
and
was
represented
by
counsel.
after
having
participated
in
that
proceeding
and
having
failed
to
seek
review
of
the
commission's
decision
and
requesting
merely
a
postponement,
the
state
of
affairs
was
that
certain
rates
for
certain
classes
of
traffic
established
rates
were
in
effect.
and
for
traffic
carried
by
the
permit
carriers
for
the
armed
forces,
the
commission's
cancellation
order
was
scheduled
to
become
effective
on
december
5,
three
days
later.
december
2
was
a
friday.
in
the
afternoon
of
friday,
december
2,
this
complaint
was
filed.
it
requested
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
an
adjudication
without
the
statute,
530
of
the
code,
was
unconstitutional.
your
honors
there
was
not
a
single
word
in
that
compliant
about
these
prior
proceedings
before
the
commission.
the
relief
requested
was
merely
that
the
commission
be
restrained
from
carrying
into
effect
the
terms
of
the
section
530.
apparently
however
sometime
before
the
united
states
attorney
presented
this
application
for
a
restraining
order
to
the
district
court,
he
or
someone
became
aware
of
this
decision
of
the
commission
cancelling
item
20
and
apparently
became
aware
of
its
significance.
and
so
this
united
states
attorney
urged
the
district
court
to
take
action
before
12:01
am
the
following
monday
in
order
to
prevent
this
action
of
the
commission
from
becoming
effective,
that
was
an
overall
representation,
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
the
complaint
about
it.
the
commission
was
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
to
be
heard
on
this
application
for
restraining
order.
i
appeared
and
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
the
difficulties
involved
with
a
restraining
order
that
was
purely
prohibitory
in
form,
and
that
was
the
form
in
which
it
had
been
proposed
by
the
government,
merely
asking
that
the
commission
be
restrained
from
taking
action,
and
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
merely
by
the
lapse
of
time
and
complete
inaction
by
the
commission,
this
decision
of
the
commission
would
become
effective
at
12:01
a.m.,
the
following
monday.
i
also
pointed
out
that
it
would
take
affirmative
action
by
the
commission
to
countermand
that
prior
decision
and
to
accomplish
what
the
government
thought.
i
advised
the
court
also
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
taking
that
affirmative
action,
maybe
it
was
late
friday
afternoon,
the
order
was
scheduled
to
become
effective
at
12:01
midnight,
monday.
and
it
was
necessary
to
give
notice
to
thousands
of
these
permit
carriers
who
had
been
presumably
making
preparations
for
a
period
of
90
days
to
get
ready
for
the
new
law
with
reference
to
rates.
nonetheless
the
district
court
issued
the
restraining
order
that
had
been
proposed,
purely
prohibitory
in
form,
but
from
bench
the
district
court
advised
me
that
he
expected
the
commission
to
take
affirmative
action
to
abate
this
decision
of
the
commission.
it
was
quite
difficult
for
the
commission
to
resolve
what
was
plainly
an
ambiguity
in
the
instructions
of
the
court,
the
written
restraining
order
saying
refrain
from
acting,
and
the
oral
part
of
the
restraining
order
saying
take
affirmative
action.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
there
are
two
ends
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
one
i
think
this
action
of
the
district
court
was
a
violation
of
the
principles
of
comity
and
even
more
important
the
action
of
the
district
court
in
issuing
this
restraining
order
and
the
action
that
the
committee
taken
in
compliance,
in
it's
attempted
to
comply
with
it
had
the
effect
of
plunging
into
confusion
and
uncertainty
the
entire
rate
structure
for
the
transportation
of
government
property
from
california.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
you
mean
on
the
ultimate
question
your
honor?
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes.
we
urge
the
court
equally
with
the
opposition
on
the
ultimate
question
we
urge
that
this
case
should
be
returned
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
that
it
should
have
never
been
tainted.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
this
is
the
present
state
of
affairs
your
honor
on
that.
so
far
as
the
transportation
by
permit
carriers
for
property
for
the
armed
forces
that
is
abeyance
by
virtue
of
the
action
the
commission
took
in
compliance
with
the
restraining
order,
and
that
is
to
say
the
commission
suspended
or
postponed
the
cancellation
of
that
item
20
until
the
final
disposition
of
this
pending
matter
in
this
court.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
so
far
as
the
traffic
of
the
permit
carriers
for
the
armed
forces
is
concerned,
there
would
be
no
immediate
effect
because
of
this
indefinite
postponement
of
this
item
20,
that
is
to
say
item
20
would
still
be
in
effect,
giving
to
permit
carriers
this
unlimited
right
to
charge
the
armed
forces
whatever
rates
they
chose.
now
so
far
as
the
other
types
of
traffic
are
concerned,
presumably
the
--
if
this
court
reverses
and
remands
--
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes.
then
in
that
event
the
section
530
of
the
statute
would
become
effective
and
would
require
these
public
utility
carriers
to
assess
and
collect
that
tariff
rates
except
armed
forces
traffic,
which
by
virtue
of
this
proviso,
they
may
still
deviate
in
order
to
compete
with
the
permit
carriers,
but
for
armed
forces
traffic
in
--
other
than
general
commodities,
and
for
traffic
of
the
all
the
all
the
civilian
agencies
of
the
united
states,
then
in
the
event
that
you
prescribed
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
section
530
would
require
the
public
utility
carriers
to
assess
and
collect
that
tariff
rate.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
there
is
sizable
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes,
that's
my
understanding,
although
there
are
no
concrete
figures
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
no
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
now
with
respect
to
that
sizable,
armed
forces
traffic
your
honor,
this
cancellation
of
the
item
20
provision
having
been
postponed
by
the
commission
is
still
outstanding
and
would
remain
outstanding
--
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
i
would
assume
yes
your
honor,
although
there
are
no
figures,
but
for
example
petroleum,
now
i
would
assume
that
the
armed
forces
transports
petroleum
in
very
large
quantities
in
california.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
that's
right,
unless
and
until
the
commission
took
action
to
arrest
it
which
it
could
do
your
honors,
and
i
should
say
that's
where
i
close,
that
the
commission
is
prepared
to
stipulate
through
its
--
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
there
was
a
stipulation
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
not
of
the
kind
i'm
about
to
describe.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
the
one
i'm
about
to
describe
is
one
whereby
judge
mckeage
as
the
attorney
for
the
commission
authorized
by
a
statute
to
exercise
all
of
its
legal
function,
is
fair
to
stipulate
that
if
this
court
should
require
the
dissolution
of
that
restraining
order
that
injunction,
and
so
that
these
conditions
which
we've
described
might
otherwise
become
effective
or
might
become
effective
in
the
absence
of
the
commission's
action,
we
would
stipulate
that
the
commission
would
take
such
action
promptly
in
order
to
avoid
having
this
immediate
impact
of
tariff
rates
fall
upon
united
states
government
traffic.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
no
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
yes.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
that
is
our
view
of
it
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
now
my
time
--
mr.
j.
thomason
phelps
the
time
i'm
allotted
to
myself
your
honor
has
ended
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
way
to
the
government,
thank
you.
