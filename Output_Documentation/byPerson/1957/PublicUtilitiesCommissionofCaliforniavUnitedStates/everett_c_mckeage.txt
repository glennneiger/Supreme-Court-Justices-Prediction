mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
i
believe
that
i
have
about
29
minutes
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
shall
attempt
if
i
can
to
answer
some
of
the
question
propounded
by
the
members
of
the
court.
i
realize
that
it's
unusual
and
i
know
of
no
similar
situation,
that
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
california
is
both
a
court
and
an
administrative
tribunal.
there
can
be
possibly
no
question
about
it.
in
our
reply
brief
we
have
set
out
the
cases.
when
the
act
was
first
interpreted,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
held
that
that
was
the
fact
and
that
is
the
fact.
now
whether
it's
unusual
or
not
it
does
exercise
the
judicial
power
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
that
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
i
should
imagine,
i
cannot
speak
except
for
the
california
commission.
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
pointed
out
that
the
constitution
and
the
legislature
both
with
liberation
took
from
the
courts
of
the
state
of
california
this
judicial
power
of
the
state
and
gave
it
to
the
commission.
and
i
might
say
that
the
--
at
least
the
reason
given
by
the
then
governor
of
california,
hiram
w.
johnson
who
was
responsible
for
this
commission
as
it
now
stands,
frankly
stated
that
the
reason
for
doing
that
was
to
place
the
commission
above
the
court's
of
general
jurisdiction
because
of
the
fact
that
in
those
days
a
number
of
these
remedial
statutes
were
being
stricken
down
by
state
courts,
one
case
the
(inaudible)
case
with
regard
to
workmen's
compensation,
so
there
is
no
question
that
that
was
deliberately
done.
the
commission
is
a
constitutional
agency
of
the
state
of
california
created
by
its
constitutional
just
the
same
as
the
legislature
or
the
executive
or
the
judiciary
is
created
and
it
was
the
intent
that
it
be
an
independent
constitutional
agency.
the
constitution
of
california
by
its
own
terms
places
the
public
utilities
act,
which
is
administered
by
the
commission,
above
the
state
constitution,
if
there
is
any
conflict.
the
cases
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
no
possible
question
about
that.
so
this
section
530
which
is
of
the
public
utilities
code
which
is
a
private
and
public
utilities
act
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
state
of
california
as
far
as
state
law
is
concerned.
now
with
regard
to
the
point
raised
that
the
state
of
california
would
be,
rather
the
federal
government
would
be
bowing
to
the
state
of
california.
i
fully
realize
the
potency
of
the
argument
made
by
the
government
with
regard
to
that,
but
we
know
that
a
lot
has
happened
since
mcculloch
versus
maryland
and
we
also
know
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
court
to
presume,
indulge
ever
presumption
in
favor
of
state
authority
in
a
case
of
this
kind
until
the
contrary
is
proven.
in
other
words,
the
relationship
between
our
dual
form
or
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government
under
our
dual
form
of
government
does
require
a
little
forbearance
and
tolerance
and
not
resolving
all
these
in
favor
of
the
predominant
power.
as
was
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
penn
dairies
case,
if
the
matter
is
decided
against
the
state
and
the
statute
is
stricken
down,
the
state
has
no
relief.
whereas
if
it's
decided
the
other
way
around
and
the
congress
is
of
the
opinion
that
a
burden
is
cast
upon
the
--
an
undue
burden
is
cast
upon
the
federal
government,
it
is
free
of
course
to
relieve
that
burden.
now
with
regard
to
the
matter
of
the
present
status
of
what
of
government
traffic
must
bear
these
tariff
rates.
the
only
exemption
that
existed
at
the
time
these
matters
started
was
the
exemption
on
general
commodities
with
regard
to
the
permit
carriers
and
also
a
complete
exemption
with
regard
to
the
so
called
public
utility
carriers.
now
the
mere
exemption
of
course
of
the
general
commodities
for
the
armed
services
would
not
cover
many
of
these
other
commodities,
but
you
can
see
the
way
this
amendment
was
drawn.
in
that
proviso
there,
it
states
that
the
public
utility
carriers,
subject
to
the
public
utilities
act,
may
charge
what
permit
carriers
are
permitting
to
charge
to
the
government.
under
the
highway
carriers
act,
the
commission
has
authority
to
exempt
all
government
traffic
from
minimum
rates.
when
it
does
that,
automatically
the
section
530
amendment
comes
into
play
and
these
public
utility
carriers
are
exempted
from
--
or
rather
they
are
given
the
authority
to
charge
reduced
rates
to
the
government.
so
it
is
within
the
power
of
this
commission,
of
the
commission,
if
this
injunction
should
be
lifted
by
the
exemption
of
government
traffic
under
the
highway
carriers
act
to
automatically
exempt
it
under
the
public
utilities
act,
and
to
institute
an
investigation
which
it
would
do
with
regard
to
what
program
to
arrange
in
implementing
section
530,
and
i
must
contend,
because
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
says
so,
that
the
commission
there,
exercising
judicial
power
could
determine
the
constitutionality
of
section
530,
but
that
wholly
aside
whether
it
could
exercise
it
that,
that
remains
it
could
exercise
its
administrative
authority.
if
it
did
hope
that
the
government,
rather
these
carriers
must
charge
some
proof
to
the
government
and
i
am
not
assuming
that
the
government
wants
special
privilege
to
the
point
of
paying
nothing,
but
suppose
the
commission
in
an
investigation
of
that
kind,
which
it
would
have
instituted,
had
it
not
been
for
this
injunction,
would
specify
some
particular
procedure
or
rate.
if
the
united
states
wanted
to
intervene
and
i'm
sure
that
it
would,
as
it
did
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
before
a
state
commission,
it
could
there
urge
all
of
these
defenses,
including
unconstitutionality
as
it
did
in
the
pennsylvania
case.
and
if
the
commission
decided
against
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
and
prescribed
some
rates,
the
commission
has
clear
authority
to
suspend
the
operating
effect
of
its
order,
whereby
the
united
states
could
seek
review
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
there
is
a
procedure
setup
somewhat
similar
to
what
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
alabama
public
service
commission
case
and
the
matter
could
get
to
this
court
in
a
proper
way.
the
government
would
not
be
injured
in
any
way
whatsoever.
now
of
course
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
i
was
just
going
to
reach
that
point
mr.
justice
black.
it
is
true
that
you
might
contend
that
this
is
a
forbearance,
and
surely
it
could
be
so
argued,
but
isn't
a
forbearance
that
should
be
smiled
upon
rather
than
frowned
upon,
when
so
much
concentration
is
right
nowadays?
wouldn't
be
helpful
to
this
relationship
between
state
and
federal
authority;
that,
that
sort
of
good
forbearance
be
shall
i
say
granted?
there
should
be
as
a
presumption
the
state
officers
until
the
contrary
is
proven
will
act
in
a
constitutional
way.
this
court
has
held
that
time
and
again.
every
presumption
must
be
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
we
are
only
asking
here
for
the
opportunity
to
exhaust
the
remedy
before
the
commission
and
after
that
has
been
exhausted
then
there's
no
question
about
this
matter
will
be
ripe.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
no.
the
only
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
that
is
right.
under
the
procedures
set
down,
under
the
constitution
and
the
public
utilities
act,
no
state
court
except
the
supreme
court
to
the
limited
extent
provided
in
that
act
has
any
authority
over
the
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
has
authority
to
set
aside
judgments
of
state
courts
and
it
has
done
so,
and
the
supreme
court
has
held
so,
so
it's
not
a
question
of
a
superior
court,
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
having
any
jurisdiction
over
the
commission,
the
contrary
is
true,
the
commission
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
i
didn't
understand
that.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
oh
no,
no
the
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
it
can
issue
orders
to
the
commission.
it
can
reverse
its
decisions,
it
can
issue
mandate
and
i'm
sure
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
i
would
have
to
answer
that
in
this
way.
they
have
gotten
mandate
in
an
original
proceeding
before
the
supreme
court.
i
cannot
recall
prohibition.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
to
tell
the
commission
to
do
a
certain
things
or
not
to
do
a
certain
thing.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
that
is
our
understanding,
i
can't
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
there
is
no
question
about
that
an
original
proceeding
can
be
commenced
in
the
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction,
it
certainly
has
asserted
it
and
made
it
effective.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well,
i
will
cite
you
a
case
to
illustrate,
that's
the
best
i
can
do.
the
commission
took
the
position
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
certain
objects
of
commerce.
certain
people
disagreed.
they
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
and
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandate,
asking
the
supreme
court
to
order
the
commission
to
take
jurisdiction
and
administer
these
objects
of
commerce,
regulate
them.
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
do
so
and
issued
a
writ
of
mandate
to
the
commission
requiring
it
to
regulate
and
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
no,
it
was
by
a
writ
of
mandate,
there
is
no
--
they
didn't
seek
out
a
review
at
all.
now
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well,
the
commission
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
and
had
just
not
undertaken
to
regulate
these
people.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
and
the
supreme
court
disagreed,
said
you
do
have
authority
and
you
should
exercise
it.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
that
was
its
decision.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
the
way
that
is
always
done,
i
have
never
known
it
to
be
done
otherwise
and
i
have
been
there
14
years
is
by
the
writ
of
review.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
yes
i
think
that
the
court
would
dismiss
any
petition
unless
it
were
a
petition
for
writ
of
review
because
that
is
the
exclusive
way
that
a
decision
of
the
commission
is
reviewed,
but
the
court
has
held
that
in
a
peculiar
situation
as
i
have
stated
that
a
writ
of
mandate
could
issue
not
withstanding
the
fact
there
was
no
review
proceeding
involved.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
comity.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
we
certainly
urge
that
and
while
these
things
get
so
close
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
it's
very
difficult
to
decide
whether
it's
comity
whether
it
should
be
as
an
absolute
matter
of
constitutional
law,
but
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
--
a
fashion
shall
i
use
that
expression
is
more
and
more
getting
to
the
point
where
these
matters
are
looked
at
in
a
conciliatory
sort
of
way.
i
know
that
the
administrative
process,
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies
orderly
procedure
like
i
think
this
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
versus
new
hampshire
and
we
are
talking
about
the
delay
incident
to
all
of
these
things
and
this
court
pointed
out
that
that
was
one
of
the
small
price
that
we
paid
for
orderly
government
and
this
would
certainly
be
orderly
government.
now
may
i
just
pass
i
think
in
all
candor
and
fairness
i
should
pass
to
the
question
raised
by
the
chief
justice
about
is
there
a
jurisdictional
defect
here.
of
course
the
state
of
california
is
not
joined
as
a
party.
well
now
i
certainly
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
you
can
find
cases
on
the
both
sides.
of
course
you
must
realize
that
the
public
utilities
commission
is
an
independent
constitutional
agency
of
the
state
of
california.
the
attorney
for
the
commission,
your
humble
servant,
is
empowered
by
the
public
utilities
act.
it
is
stated
as
his
duty
to
represent
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
commission
in
all
matters
involving
such
a
public
utility
regulation
in
that
state.
so
i
would
assume
that
a
good
argument
could
be
made,
i
am
not
trying
to
make
the
argument
for
mr.
davis,
but
i
am
in
all
candor
and
fairness
i
suppose
an
argument
could
be
made
in
that
setting
that
that
type
of
a
constitutional
agency
having
been
made
the
defendant
with
its
counsel
empowered
to
represent
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
in
all
of
these
matters
that
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
state
of
california
is
here.
now
there
are
cases
i
am
fully
aware
of
that
dismiss
a
matter
if
the
state
is
not
joined.
in
other
words,
you
can
test
the
constitutionality
of
it.
i
realize
that
there
are
cases
that
come
up
in
this
wise
that
you
sue
the
agents
of
a
state
or
of
the
united
states
and
it
happens
to
be
within
an
area
where
the
sovereign
has
not
consented
to
be
sued
and
the
courts
have
held
that
it
is
law
and
in
effect
a
suit
against
sovereign
not
withstanding
the
fact
the
sovereign
isn't
named
as
such
but
the
--
its
agents
are
named
and
therefore
the
suit
fails,
because
consent
has
not
been
given.
so
i
think
there
were
a
variety
of
cases
on
it,
but
in
fairness
to
the
record
i
did
want
to
state
the
proposition,
i
have
no
answer
for
it,
although
this
is
fatally
defective
without
the
state
of
california
being
joined.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
the
suit
against
the
commission,
if
it
were
an
original
action
of
course
would
be
so
and
so
petitioner
against
public
utilities
commission,
state
of
california
respondent.
now
in
all
review
proceedings
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
no
not
at
all.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
no.
the
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
the
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
in
all
review
proceedings
at
the
commission
and
the
commission
alone
is
made
the
respondent,
whatever
maybe
the
law
that's
what
we
have
all
assumed
that,
that
is
sufficient
and
the
state
is
never
joined
in
those
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well,
there
could
not
be
a
suit
against
the
commission
in
a
state
court
save
in
except,
in
that
exceptional
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
our
state.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
no,
there
the
state
is
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
have
we
urged
it?
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
in
the
good
conscience
i
could
not
urge
it
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
the
state
has
not
been
joined,
but
it
is
with
relation
to
the
factual
situation
as
to
whether
it
was
right
that
the
injunction
should
be
against
the
public
utilities
commission,
whether
we
had
done
something
that
justified
some
injunction.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well,
surely
the
various
precedents
for
suing
public
officials
charged
with
the
execution
of
a
statute
and
the
enjoining
them
and
now
of
course
it
may
or
may
not
be
that
this
question,
that
a
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
the
federal
government
or
the
state
as
the
case
maybe
should
be
joined
as
a
party,
but
as
far
as
the
relief
is
concerned,
getting
down
to
the
ultimate,
the
end
result,
as
far
as
the
relief
is
concerned,
the
united
states
has
secured
all
possible
relief
that
i
know
that
it
could
secure,
by
paralyzing
the
arm
of
the
commission,
there
is
nobody
else
in
california
that
can
do
anything
except
the
commission,
so
it
has
all
the
relief
it
could
get
there.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
i
--
it's
certainly
about
your
wish
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
i
do
think
that
all
we
would
get
would
be
a
sometime
probably
variety
of
decisions
which
--
but
we
have
in
good
faith,
i
mean
in
good
conscience
say
that
there
is
a
fatal
defect
here
because
the
state
of
california
is
not
joined.
and
now
if
your
honors
please
i
think
my
time
is
about
up,
unless
there
is
some
other
questions
that
the
court
would
desire
to
ask,
why
i
will
retire.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
yes
well
i
would
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
those
in
claimed
embarrassment
and
inconveniences
are
the
historical
objections
to
all
regulation.
when
regulation
was
originally
sought
against
the
railroads,
you
will
find
that
the
same
type
of
claimed
embarrassments
impossibility,
chaotic
conditions,
we
can't
separate
intrastate
and
interstate.
all
of
those
arguments
were
brought
forward
by
the
objects
of
regulation.
so
i
fear
that
these
arguments
and
i
have
of
course
sat
through
them,
participated
in
the
trial,
fall
into
that
category.
the
two
railroad
witnesses
who
came
there
gave
just
about
the
same
type
of
testimony
that
they
would
have
given
back
in
1887
when
they
sought
to
put
them
under
regulation.
it
is
pretty
much
like
some
of
these,
you
will
pardon
this
illusion,
these
statements
made
during
political
campaigns
that
if
a
certain
party
is
elected
why
grass
will
go
in
the
streets
of
the
villages
and
so
forth
and
so
on
and
--
but
these
are
matters
with
those
of
us
who
have
lived
with
regulation.
we
are
used
to
those
things.
now
with
regard
to
the
secrecy
matter,
it
would
be
very
simple
and
easy
by
the
public
utilities
commission
to
exempt
all
practically
it
was
claimed
to
have
security
and
naturally
enough
we
found
that
that
was
abused,
was
being
abused,
and
used
a
cover
up
something
later
might
be
done
about
it.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
no
i
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
i
would
say
this
that
reasonable
men
could
differ
on
that
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
view,
that
view
could
be
taken,
but
we
maintain
that
another
view
could
be
taken
and
when
you
approach
the
rule
of
testing
constitutionality
of
the
statute
the
--
you
must
choose
the
one
that
will
save
the
statute
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
national
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
that
is
of
course
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
--
express
here,
pennsylvania
has
already
done
it
and
so
i,
i
assume
that
would
that
is
a
fear.
however,
getting
back
on
the
high
level
of
the
relationship
between
these
two
governments
a
little
forbearance
by
the
federal
government
might
well
be
in
order.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
that
is
right.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
the
carrier
if
assuming
that
we
had
issued
an
order
directed
to
the
carrier
that
it
must
charge
a
certain
rate
and
if
it
didn't
charge
that
rate
it
would
be
subject
of
course
to
punishment
under
the
public
utilities
act.
but
we
maintain
that
the
government
wouldn't
be
subject
to
punishment,
any
of
its
agents
under
the
well
known
decisions
that
just
a
person
who
merely
purchases
something
unless
there
is
a
specific
vision
of
the
statute.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
there
is
no
question
about
it
if
the
order
had
been
issued
which
hasn't
been
issued.
that
is
the
point
mr.
justice
black.
we
haven't
gotten
to
that
yet.
the
injunction
stopped
us
before
we
had
a
chance
to
hold
a
hearing
or
to
do
anything
about
prescribing
these
rates.
but
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
it
is
directed
to
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
it
has
no
other
purpose
that
i
know
of.
it's
just
to
reverse
what
originally
was
the
law
that
you
could
allow
--
that
the
carriers
were
privileged,
but
understand
this
act
runs
not
through
the
united
states
government,
but
it's
a
privilege
granted
the
carrier,
that
carrier
doesn't
have
to
grant
reduced
rates.
it
could
require
the
government
to
pay
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
we
take
that
position
your
honor.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
that
--
well
we
certainly
take
that
that
position
as
the
ultimate
thing
under
the
10th
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
that
the
state
of
california
does
have
that
right.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
it
lies
within
the
commission's
power
mr.
justice
black
to
exempt
all
of
this
traffic
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
yes
that
is
right.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
it
lies
within
the
power
of
the
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
as
i
said
before
your
honor
--
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
you
could,
you
could
draw
that
conclusion.
we
believe
that
another
conclusion
from
this
could
be
drawn.
mr.
everett
c.
mckeage
well
that
is
our
feeling
and
that
is
what
we
thought
when
we
started
out
on
this
thing
but
the
government,
well
shall
i
say
abandoned
that
program
and
went
into
the
federal
court.
