justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
is
this
portion
of
your
argument
mr.
phelps?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
end
are
you
directing
your
present
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
â€“
the
conclusion
i
draw
from
what
you've
just
said
that
if
your
--
the
inference
of
your
argument
is
accepted
it
would
have
been
needless
to
go
in
to
all
these
far
--
more
far
reaching
issues,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
would
the
consequence
of
that
be
regarding
government
shipments?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
your
remedy,
if
i
follow
you
and
the
suit
would
be
dismissed
then
that
restraining
order
would
fall
too,
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
everything,
so
one
must
assume
that
the
slate
is
wiped
clean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
that
assumption
i
have
asked
you
what
would
be
the
consequence
regarding
government
shipment
or
armed
service
shipment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
didn't,
assume,
make
your
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
suit
in
order
dismissed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
shipments
made
the
armed
force,
what
proportion
roughly
indicated
to
be,
is
what
you
call
general
traffic
and
what
is
not?
what
would
be
within
the
dispensing
power
and
what
would
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sizable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
sizable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
upshot
is
that
the
armed
service
shipments
would
be
subject
to
--
would
be
dependent
on
the
traffics
filed
with
your
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
these
--
as
to
the
area
that
you
just
would
be
very
sizable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
that
the
--
i
wanted
to
know
what
is
not
subject
to
that
cancellation,
is
that
sizable?
is
the
armed
service
traffic
not
within
the
protection
of
the
qualification,
the
freedom
to
give
what
rates
--
is
that
sizable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
as
to
that
body
of
traffic,
armed
service
traffic,
the
traffic
would
have
to
move
subject
to
california
rates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
not
on
the
record,
isn't
it?
there
was
such
a
stipulation
of
--
there
was
a
stipulation
of
fair
deal
of
not
making
trouble
or
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
judge
mckeage
appointee
of
the
governor
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
appointee
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
commission
survive,
if
i
read
correctly
the
papers,
you
are
to
have
a
new
governor
before
very
long.
does
it
survive
a
change
in
the
occupancy
of
sacramento?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this,
he
can
give
an
assurance
that
outlives
the
governor
and
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you're
fortunate
to
have
this
kind
of
a
commission,
that's
non
political.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
relevant
to
the
argument.
i
am
just
expressing
private
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
the
california
commission
on
petition
of
the
united
states
give
you
everything
you
want?
could
the
california
legislation
authorize
its
commission
and
give
you
relief
to
the
full
extent
that
the
government
insists
upon
in
assailing
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
involved
the
desire
of
the
government
to
ship
gasoline
or
whatever
the
commodities
are,
my
imagination
(inaudible)
at
certain
rates
or
free
of
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
could
you
file
a
petition
with
the
california
commission
saying
the
governments
desires
to
ship
so
many
tons,
or
so
many
barrels,
or
so
many
caskets
of
this,
that
or
the
other
commodity
at
the
following
rate
or
free
of
charge,
i
suppose
government
doesn't
want
it
for
nothing
at
this
kind
of
a
rate,
is
the
california
commission
empowered
to
grant
such
a
petition
physically
seeking,
leaving
uncle
sam
out
of
pocket
by
not
one
cent
more
than
you
want
to
be
left
out
of
the
pocket?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
as
the
matter
of
dollar
and
cents
you
could
get
the
kind
of
transportation
charge
that
the
united
states
wants?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
say
a
word
as
to
why
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
go
through
what
might
be
merely
idle
form
if
you
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
partial
as
to
what
you
want
in
dollars
and
cents
in
full?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
question,
that's
the
question
of
fact.
can
it
give
you
the
transportation
rates
that
you
want?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
proceeding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
it
start
an
independent
proceeding
for
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
just
pulled
out
that
particular
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
get
the
disclosure
--
i
don't
get
the
disclosure
point
at
all
because
i
assume
that
when
you
make
a
private
arrangement
with
a
trucker,
you
have
to
tell
him
what
he
has
to
carry,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
you
say
we're
going
to
present
you
with
so
many
cases
and
we're
ready
to
pay
not
more
than
x
dollars
per
ton,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
push
you
on
that
specific
point,
you
couldn't
make
such
an
arrangement
with
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
way
to
keep
a
secret
is
to
keep
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
be,
that
exception
would
be
prospective
and
not
retrospective?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
they
have
power
to
make
it
retrospective,
then
so
far
as
money
is
concerned
uncle
sam
isn't
got
a
pocket
and
you
have
to
evoke
some
other
non-monitory
consideration
of
potential
harm
to
the
united
states,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
on
the
other
hand
if
this
patriotic
vow
by
the
representatives
of
california,
that
they
want
to
be
just
as
helpful,
just
as
respectful
of
the
needs
of
united
states
as
the
government
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
actually
did
impose
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
issue,
this
isn't
speculated.
there
wasn't
any
dispensing
power,
but
it
appears
(inaudible)
to
the
governor
or
to
then
the
attorney
general
roger
taney,
but
he
can
wave
the
fact,
you
actually
have
an
obstructive
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
this,
that
if
ultimately
california
has
no
power
to
determine
what
uncle
sam
arranged
between
himself
and
the
truckers,
he
doesn't
have
to
get
that
position
by
leave,
by
the
grace
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
corporate
--
is
this
the
corporate
body
mr.
davis
under
california
law,
public
utilities
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
it's
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
know
about
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that,
although
the
legislature
of
california
has
empowered
this
commission
to
do
something
or
to
make
certain
demands,
you
say
that
the
legislature
of
california
went
beyond
its
constitutional
power,
therefore
the
officials
are
not
close
with
authority,
and
therefore
you
enjoin
them
from
doing
what
the
legislature
of
california
authorized
them
to
do
but
has
to
now
power
to
authorize.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
could
you
tell
me
whether
in
those
other
cases
where
local
law
had
to
yield
or
deem
constitutionally
inapplicable
to
federal
activity,
the
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
postal
carrier,
johnson
against
maryland,
whether
in
those
cases
there
were
suspensory
provisions
in
the
state
law
provisions,
allowing
relief
or
suspension
of
the
state
power
as
against
federal
agencies,
do
you
have
anything
on
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
always
thought
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me
the
most
trivial
of
the
laws
[attempt
to
laughter]
using
oleomargarine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
see
the
foundation
of
this
country
shaking
it
if
that's
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
other
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
had
it
before
the
virginia
commission.
i
think
the
oklahoma
commission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
mr.
mckeage
whether
under
your
law,
a
plaintiff
can
go
into
a
california
court
and
seek
to
enjoin
the
commission
from
doing
something
on
the
theory
that
it
has
exceeded
the
statutory
or
constitutional
speed
limit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
action
has
to
go
through
the
commission
and
then
to
the
supreme
court
of
your
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
supreme
court
can
issue
prohibition
against
their
taking
hold
of
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
powerless,
is
it,
to
issue
prohibition
against
the
utility
commission
taking
certain
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
issue
prohibition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
mean
on
appeal,
can
a
plaintiff
in
california
go
before
your
supreme
court
and
ask
for
--
get
a
writ
of
prohibition
against
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
your
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
mandate
is
what,
mandatory
injunction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
do
it,
but
also
not
to
do
a
certain
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
proceeding
can
be
begun
in
your
supreme
court,
in
your
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
that
--
in
cases
that
you
have
in
mind
about
which
i'm
totally
ignorant,
one
does
not
have
to
go
through
your
utility
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
did
not
--
and
that
in
the
case
that
you've
just
given
me,
you're
good
enough
to
give
me,
the
proceeding
was
not
a
review
of,
an
ordinary
appellate
review
of
what
the
commission
declined
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
gather
if
i
did
gather
correctly,
i
gather
that
you
said
the
other
way
around
as
also
occur
namely
that
the
commission
has
exercised
the
authority
and
you
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
and
got
an
order
of
mandate
telling
it
to
seek
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
writ
of
review?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
urging,
you
are
urging
this
as
i
follow
you
both
of
the
matter
of
high
(inaudible)
between
two
governments
what
is
usually
called
comity,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
originated
on
that
ground
that
it
makes
for
the
smooth
workings
of
this
two
geared
governments,
these
two
governments
of
ours,
the
government
of
united
states
go
through
this
regular
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
own
state,
if
review
is
a
sought
of
an
order
of
your
commission,
by
an
interested
party
how
is
that
suit
entitled
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
state
is
always
joined
if
a
shipper
or
a
railroad
objects
to
some
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
public
--
i
see
california
was
not
the
state,
but
(inaudible)
of
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
must
have
been
or
have
you
been
fortunate
enough,
never
to
have
had
a
suit
against
the
commission
in
which
some
constitutional
claim
was
made,
you
had
such
things,
haven't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
if
it's
in
the
supreme
court,
if
your
commission
takes
jurisdiction
and
a
shipper
or
a
railroad
claims
that
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
is
unconstitutional,
and
on
that
seeks
review
in
your
supreme
court,
the
state
as
i
understand
you
would
not
be
joined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
couldn't
be
against
the
state
as
such,
it
might
be
against
the
government
or
the
legislature,
i
don't
know
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
be
against
â€“
if
you
couldn't
enjoin
the
state
as
such,
whom
would
you
enjoin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
in
addition
to
what
you
have
said,
these
considerations
of
practical
incidence,
practical
--
all
of
inconvenience
or
difficulty
or
embarrassment,
putting
financial
consideration
to
one
side,
what
do
you
say
to
these
practicalities,
the
arguments
of
really
inconvenience
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
disturbance
or
call
them
what
you
will,
embarrassment
that
mr.
davis
urged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
any
or
do
you,
am
i
right
in
assuming
you
do
not
question
that
congress
could
tomorrow
in
organizing
things,
pass
a
statute
saying
it's
the
policy
of
the
united
states
in
view
of
the
intermittent
help
that
it
is
giving
to
railroads
of
one
sort
or
another
that
all
governmental
property
be
carried
without
cost.
putting
to
one
side
question
of
taking
property
without
due
processes
of
law,
california
couldn't
say
this,
thereby
the
government
exceeded
its
power,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
then
we
get
on
to
the
narrower
question
as
mr.
davis
puts
it,
whether
you
haven't
got
here
not
a
conflict
with
an
explicit
statute,
but
a
sufficient
practical
and
conflict
with
what
the
government
wants
to
do
or
is
doing
particularly
in
view
of
california's
very
sizable
relation
to
these
armed
service
shipments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
where
would
you
at
all
if
california
can
do
this,
new
york
can
do
it,
really.
justice
felix
frankfurter
florida
et
cetera?
