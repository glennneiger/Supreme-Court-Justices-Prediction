mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
issue
in
this
case
and
in
the
next
case
which
follows
is
whether
when
a
person
dies
leaving
an
estate
which
is
insufficient
to
meet
income
taxes
which
he
incurred
while
alive,
whether
the
united
states
can
recover
and
collect
from
the
beneficiaries
of
his
life
insurance.
now,
this
question
can
be
further
divided
into
whether
the
beneficiary,
if
liable
at
all,
is
liable
to
the
full
extent
of
the
receipts
from
the
insurance
company
or
whether
it
might
--
the
beneficiary
might
be
limited
in
liability
to
the
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policies
which
the
insured
might
have
reduced
the
possession
during
his
life.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
there
are
really
only
two
cases
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
this
case
and
then
there's
petition
on
cross
petition
in
the
bess
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
good
many
other
cases
which
have
been
decided
on
this
issue,
but
before
this
court
at
present
time
are
these
two
cases.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that's
one
of
the
basic
problems
in
this
case.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
after
dr.
stern
died
in
1949,
they
discovered
that
he
had
been
cheating
on
his
income
tax.
a
substantial
liability
including
fraud
penalties
was
adjudicated
against
him
in
the
tax
court
and
the
amount
of
that
liability
is
not
in
question
here.
at
the
time
of
his
death,
dr.
stern
had
enforced
17
life
insurance
policies
which
had
accumulated
a
substantial
cash
surrender
values.
his
wife
was
named
as
beneficiary
in
each
one
of
these
insurance
policies,
but
dr.
stern
has
retained
the
right
to
assign
the
policies,
to
change
the
beneficiary,
to
borrow
against
the
cash
surrender
value
or
to
surrender
the
policies
entirely.
since
they
were
insufficient
assets
in
dr.
stern's
estate
to
meet
his
income
taxes,
the
united
states
attempted
to
collect
these
taxes
from
the
beneficiary
of
his
life
--
of
his
life
insurance
on
the
ground
that
she
was
an
assignee,
a
transferee
of
these
--
of
this
property
from
him
and
that
since
it
was
assigned
to
her
without
consideration
when
the
taxes
couldn't
be
paid
that
the
united
states
was
entitled
to
follow
these
assets
in
different
hands.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
we
can
assume
that
he
was,
at
least
the
united
states
has
not
proved
that
he
wasn't.
so,
the
purposes
of
this
case,
it
can
be
assumed
he
was
so.
mrs.
stern
submitted
the
question
of
her
liability
to
the
tax
court
and
the
tax
court
found
that
she
was
liable
up
to
the
full
amount
of
the
insurance
benefits
that
she
had
received.
she
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
tax
court
on
the
ground
that
a
widow
is
not
a
transferee
with
respect
to
insurance
policies
and
in
addition,
that
under
kentucky
law,
a
widow,
a
beneficiary
of
insurance
cannot
be
liable
for
her
husband's
death.
since
this
decision
was
in
conflict,
at
least
in
part
with
the
case
of
united
states
against
bess
which
was
decided
in
the
third
circuit.
the
united
states
petitioned
for
certiorari
and
that's
why
we
are
here.
now,
just
a
word
about
the
nature
of
these
policies
that
were
involved,
there
were
17
of
them
and
they
were
not
termed
insurance
which
is
pure
insurance
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
savings
element
in
it.
these
were
ordinary
life
insurance
policies
under
which
the
insured
pays
a
amount
in
excess
of
the
pure
insurance
cost
during
the
early
years
of
the
policy
and
a
reserved
accumulates
which
he,
under
his
insurance
contract,
is
entitled
to
borrow
against
or
in
case
he
surrenders
the
policy,
he's
entitled
to
withdraw
the
cash
surrender
value
in
full.
now,
also
with
--
with
respect
to
these
policies,
the
insured
retain
full
control
to
change
the
beneficiary
at
any
time
up
to
his
death
or
to
assign
the
policy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
sorry,
mr.
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
they
are
all
--
they
all
anteceded
the
tax
here
is
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
premiums
were
paid
up
until
the
time
--
were
paid
by
dr.
stern
up
to
the
time
of
his
death.
now,
the
courts
have
reached
diverse
results
in
cases
on
substantially
similar
cases
--
similar
facts
to
this.
the
tax
court
has
uniformly
held
that
the
beneficiary
of
such
insurance
is
liable
to
the
--
to
the
full
amount
of
the
principal
amount
of
the
insurance
paid
to
the
beneficiary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
has
held
that
the
beneficiary
is
liable
but
only
to
the
extent
of
a
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policies
which
the
insured
could
have
reduced
the
possession
during
his
life
time.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
transfer
from
the
insured
to
the
beneficiary
of
a
cash
surrender
value,
but
it's
held
that
the
beneficiary
is
not
liable
because
liability
is
governed
by
new
york
law
and
under
new
york
law,
the
insurance
goes
to
the
beneficiary
free
and
clear
of
death.
the
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
have
held
that
the
insurance
beneficiary
is
under
no
liability
to
the
government
at
all.
now,
basically,
the
results
in
these
cases
do
not
rest
upon
any
particular
language
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
particular
action
was
brought
under
a
section
called
section
311
of
the
1939
code
which
is
merely
a
section
which
provides
for
the
procedure
of
collecting
a
liability
against
the
transferee.
it
is
uniformly
agreed
in
the
cases
that
section
311
does
not
itself
establish
the
liability.
the
basis
for
the
government's
claim
in
these
cases
is
the
so-called
trust
fund
doctrine
and
that
in
very
simple
words
is,
that
when
a
debtor
transfers
part
of
his
assets
to
a
third
person
without
consideration
at
a
time
when
he
is
insolvent
or
when
this
transfer
will
--
a
transfer
will
make
him
insolvent
that
the
creditor
can
follow
those
assets
into
the
hands
of
the
transferee.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
there's
nothing
in
the
tax
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
originally,
you'll
get
it
from
13
elizabeth
5,
but
it
is
part
of
our
law
at
the
time
--
it's
always
been
recognized
as
part
of
our
equity
law
since
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
both
state
and
federal
law
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
we've
got
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
well,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
it
is
something
that
the
collection
--
when
a
debt
is
--
when
the
debt
is
established
under
the
--
under
the
primary
death
is
established
under
the
tax
law,
of
course,
and
the
question
of
who
is
liable
for
that
debt
and
how
one
goes
about
obtaining
it,
is
how
the
courts
enforced
in
effect,
how
they
enforce
that
liability
against
whom
they
will
enforce
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
certainly
does
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
assume
the
contrary.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
he
was
solvent
at
the
time
he
paid
the
--
at
the
time
he
took
out
the
contract
and
at
the
time
he
paid
the
premiums,
i
am
assuming
that
he
is
insolvent.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
--
no.
i
am
going
after
the
transfer
of
either
the
entire
amount
of
the
policy
or
the
cash
surrender
value
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
property
of
the
taxpayer
which
was
transferred
to
the
beneficiary
at
the
time
of
the
taxpayer's
death.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
a
big
problem
if
you
went
back
to
13
elizabeth
itself
would
be
intent
to
defraud.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
elizabeth
one.
[laughter]
now,
the
original
fraudulent
conveyance
act
involved
intentional
defrauding
of
creditors,
then
as
it
has
been
developed
in
the
law,
when
a
--
when
a
debtor
is
insolvent
and
transfers
part
of
his
property
without
consideration,
it
has
been
held
that
you
don't
go
into
the
intent
that
you
just
--
that
an
insolvent
person
just
can't
transfer
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
we
have
--
in
order
to
establish
our
case,
the
transfer
would
have
to
take
place
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
transfer
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
death.
i'm
not
sure
that
you
could
say
that
he
did
it,
but
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
--
he
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
took
no
voluntary
--
he
took
no
affirmative
act.
he
--
up
until
the
time
of
his
death,
he
had
a
--
let's
take
the
face
value.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
certainly
--
this
is
the
origin
of
--
of
the
trust
fund
doctrine.
it's
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
derives
from
fraud.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
my
--
my
argument
is
that
he
had
the
power
up
until
the
time
he
died
to
transferred
this
to
anybody
else.
this
--
she
was
temporarily
named.
she
had
a
--
a
right
which
could
be
divested.
it
is
a
power
of
--
in
effect
--
a
thing
that
you
have
in
a
power
of
appointment
so
that
her
right
matured,
whatever
rights
he
retained
were
transferred
at
that
time
of
his
death.
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
right,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
tentative
right
to
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
well,
i'm
not
going
into
whether
he
should
or
whether
he
shouldn't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
the
effect
of
the
law,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
there
was
any
voluntary
act,
they
arose
instead
that
of
--
he
didn't
exercise
his
power
in
any
other
way.
he
had
a
power
to
move
it
to
somebody
else
and
he
died.
i
don't
call
that
a
voluntary
act.
it
is
the
act
which
caused
his
--
his
death.
if
we
run
into
this
same
sort
of
problem
and
the
court
is
meted
with
respect
to
insurance
policy,
with
respect
to
estate
taxes.
the
--
the
law
--
the
state
law
includes
in
a
decedents
gross
estate,
certain
insurance
policies
as
to
which
he
retained
certain
powers
of
ownership
such
as
changing
the
beneficiary.
and
soon
after
the
--
the
act
was
passed,
it
was
attacked
on
the
ground
that
the
decedent
didn't
really
transfer
anything,
that
he
didn't
own
the
policy.
he
just
taken
out
a
--
a
third
party
contract
and
when
he
died,
these
rights
originated
and
came
to
the
beneficiary.
and
this
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
state
law
passed
said,
that
there
was
in
effect
a
transfer
which
occurs
because
of
the
death
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
person
to
be
taxed
in
that
case
and
i
submit
that
it's
the
same
kind
of
a
transfer
which
occurs
here.
here
is
a
man
that
has
certain
rights
which
--
and
as
to
the
cash
surrender
value.
he
can
actually
reduce
the
amount
of
money,
the
actual
possession.
he
dies,
the
rights
passed
to
--
to
the
beneficiary
and
the
question
is
can
we
follow
them?
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
there
was
a
transfer.
that
is
all
i'm
raising
it
for,
that
there
is
a
transfer.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
and
you
have
to
find
that
the
--
that
there
is
a
transfer.
maybe
this
was
would
be
clear
if
i
approached
it
first
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
cash
surrender
value
itself.
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i'm
wrong.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
except
the
tax
--
the
tax
court
of
course.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
has
been
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we've
--
they
think
they're
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
sixth
circuit?
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
the
state
of
the
opinion.
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
think
my
position
can
be
made
clearer
if
i
point
out
some
of
the
aspects
of
this
cash
surrender
value,
which
it
is
our
position,
the
insured
had
and
transferred
at
the
time
of
his
death.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
this
court
has
--
has
pointed
out
the
similarity
between
the
cash
surrender
value
in
an
insurance
policy
and
the
savings
deposit
in
a
savings
bank
and
the
short
analysis
shows
that
--
that
this
is
indeed
sound.
if
a
man
wishes
to
ensure
his
life
for
$10,000
and
takes
out
a
term
insurance
policy
and
annually
deposits
in
a
savings
bank
the
difference
between
the
cost
of
a
term
policy
and
the
cost
of
an
ordinary
life
policy,
he
will
in
fact
get
the
equivalent
of
taking
out
an
ordinary
life
policy
where
the
company
itself
accumulates
the
savings
instead
of
--
is
having
to
do
so
in
a
separate
account.
now,
if
the
man
took
out
term
insurance
plus
savings
account,
there'd
be
no
question
that
on
his
death,
the
savings
account
would
be
--
could
be
reached
for
--
for
his
taxes
or
for
any
debt.
the
mere
fact
that
he
accumulates
his
savings
with
the
same
company
that
gives
the
insurance
policy,
seems
to
us
to
make
--
to
make
no
difference
as
to
whether
it
should
be
subject
to
his
debt.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
held
and
i
--
i
think
there's
really
little
dispute
about
it
now,
that
if
it
is
ascertained
during
the
insured's
life
that
he
owes
these
income
taxes,
the
united
states
can
recover
--
during
his
life
can
recover
the
--
the
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policies.
sometimes,
it's
done
through
attachment
and
sometimes
it's
done
through
a
separate
third
party
garnishments
to
--
in
which
the
insurance
company
is
named
to
the
--
to
the
party,
but
the
cases
generally
hold
that
you
can
reach
that
cash
surrender
value
and
similarly
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
during
the
lifetime
and
similarly
in
bankruptcy,
the
bank
--
the
bankruptcy
statute
includes
the
cash
surrender
value
within
the
gross
--
within
the
estate
of
the
--
of
the
debtor
although
there
are
certain
provisions
so
that
he
can
keep
them
alive
by
making
payments
of
the
premiums
to
save
the
insurance,
but
it
--
it
is
regularly
recognized
as
an
asset
of
the
insured
which
can
be
reached
in
order
to
--
to
pay
his
debts.
and
therefore
it
seems
that
it
is
something
which
materially
he
has
and
which
if
--
if
we
could
ascertain
the
amount
of
income
tax
in
time,
we
could
have
reached.
and
if
it
is
transferred
from
him
to
somebody
else
at
the
time
of
his
death,
it
would
seem
only
reasonable
that
we
should
be
able
to
follow
it.
now,
when
you
come
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
could
be
so
except
that
would
--
the
exemptions
statutes
of
most
states
provides
specifically
to
protect
the
--
the
beneficiary
of
the
insurance
benefits
from
predators
of
the
--
of
the
deceased.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
we
would
say
that
they
were
--
they
were
an
exemption
in
the
--
and
the
states
have
no
--
no
power
to
put
in
exemptions
as
to
what
the
united
states
make
a
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
no
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
none
as
far
as
insurance
benefits
are
concerned.
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
state
tax?
insurance
--
the
insurance
payments
are
included
within
the
gross
of
estate
of
the
deceased
as
part
of
the
estate
tax.
if
the
insured
retains
this
incident
of
ownership
which
were
involved
in
this
case
of
a
right
to
change
the
beneficiary
far
down
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it
is
specifically,
made
part
of
the
gross
estate
and
that
is
why
the
case
came
up
whether
or
not
there
was
a
transfer
because
if
there
wasn't
a
transfer,
it
was
argued
that
there
was
a
direct
tax
on
the
insurance
and
that
it
wasn't
properly
apportioned.
and
so,
it
became
a
constitutional
question
whether
there
was
a
transfer
of
these
insurance
benefits
from
the
deceased
to
the
beneficiary
which
would
support
an
excised
--
excised
tax
on
the
transfer
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
sufficient
of
a
transfer
with
respect
to
the
entire
--
face
amount
of
the
policy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
the
estate
tax
is
part
of
the
--
if
the
--
if
the
insured
retains
this
incident
of
ownership
which
are
involved
here,
these
incidents
of
power
to
control
then
this
is
part
of
the
gross
estate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
are,
there's
a
$60,000
exemption
in
the
--
in
the
estate
tax
and
if
the
insurance
policy
is
part
of
the
--
if
the
--
if
the
proceeds
are
part
of
the
estate,
they
--
and
don't
exceed
this
--
there
is
a
$60,000
and
then
there's
a
widow's
exemption
too.
i
mean,
there
are
other
exemptions.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
not
with
respect
to
insurance
as
such.
i
mean,
this
was
as
an
estate
tax
exemption
which
isn't
specifically
attached
to
insurance.
there
used
to
be
--
there
used
to
be
a
--
a
volume
exemption
with
respect
to
life
insurance
in
the
estate
tax
which
is
no
longer
there.
insurances
in
one
way
with
respect
to
the
--
the
face
amount
of
the
policy,
merely
a
third
party
contract.
if
a
desires
to
give
b
an
automobile
and
a
goes
to
a
dealer
and
pays
him
the
price
of
the
car
and
asked
that
it
be
delivered
to
b,
in
common
powers,
a
gives
b
the
automobile,
even
though
a
never
had
title
to
the
automobile
himself.
he
provided
for
a
transfer,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happens
in
the
case
of
insurance.
the
insured
goes
to
the
insurance
company
and
provides
that
if
he
will
pay
the
premiums,
the
price
of
the
insurance
from
time
to
time,
the
insurance
company
will
transfer
the
face
amount
of
the
policy
to
the
beneficiary
on
his
death,
and
if
one
must
said
it
in
that
light
by
the
mere
questions
of
the
--
of
title
are
not
important.
it
is
a
--
a
provision
for
where
he
has
bought
and
had
delivered
the
insurance
to
the
beneficiary.
the
court
below
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
quite
a
list
of
cases
going
back
quite
away.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
of
any
--
of
any
inconsistent
actions
by
the
government.
the
court
below,
following
rowen,
held
that
the
liability
of
a
beneficiary
in
a
case
like
this
is
to
be
determined
by
a
state
law
rather
than
by
federal
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
says
the
question
of
liability
depends
upon
federal
law
and
it
seems
to
me
really
impossible
that
there
could
be
an
equitable
method
of
collecting
income
taxes
if
liability
is
not
determined
by
federal
law.
it
is
true
that
in
some
respects,
income
taxes
can
be
affected
by
state
law
if
--
if
for
example
title
is
involved
and
the
states
determined
title,
then
there
is
an
indirect
effect
to
the
state
law.
we
--
we
know
for
example
that
a
few
years
ago,
the
community
property
law
in
the
western
states
resulted
in
a
situation
where
a
man
and
his
wife
could
divide
their
income
for
the
community
property
estate
and
couldn't
in
other
state
and
this
has
affected
taxes
was
a
direct
effect
of
the
state
law.
but
that's
a
very
different
situation
from
where
the
state
law
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
whether
there
will
be
liability
of
a
to
b.
if
a
state
can
say
that
the
widow
isn't
liable
under
these
circumstances,
i
don't
know
why
a
state
couldn't
say
that
a
man's
entire
estate
shall
pass
to
--
all
of
his
properties
shall
pass
through
his
estate,
free
of
taxes
whether
it
would
be
insurance
or
anything
else.
and
in
this
respect,
each
state
could
fight
with
the
other
to
see
what
benefits
it
could
gain
for
its
--
its
citizens
against
the
--
against
the
federal
tax
collector.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
the
--
generally
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
form
of
these
statutes
is
generally
that
the
beneficiary
shall
get
full
title
free
and
clear.
it's
stated
affirmatively
in
that
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
would
--
i
would
have
no
doubt
if
they
get
titled,
but
i
would
have
doubt
that
the
states
could
by
saying
that
they
get
it
free
and
clear
of
any
claim.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
then
we
come
back
again,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
when
the
interest
was
created.
if
we
go
back
to
the
time
the
insurance
policy
was
taken
out,
out
of
premiums
were
paid
then
we
--
we
would
have
a
very
--
a
very
bad
case
because
there's
insolvency
at
that
time.
we
have
to
treat
it
as
though
the
interest
matured
at
the
time
of
the
taxpayer's
death.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
and
there's
no
question,
they
had
--
some
states
say,
a
divested
right
subject
to
divest
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it
is
a
real
interest,
but
it
isn't
a
final
interest
and
it
doesn't
--
and
it
doesn't
really
come
down
to
cash
from
the
bank
until
the
man
died.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that's
when
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
that
is
the
time
when
we
say
there
is
a
transfer
of
--
of
the
insurance
interest
to
the
beneficiary.
it's
necessary
that
--
our
case
really
depends
upon
--
upon
the
transfer
occurring
at
that
time
or
we
--
or
we
have
no
case.
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
the
present
state
of
confusion
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
states
have
enacted
specific
laws
of
relation
to
insurance
to
protect
widows
and
orphans
and
people
who
needs
the
benefits
of
insurance.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
question
--
that
is
--
that's
right.
if
there
is
--
that
policy
maybe
a
good
policy
and
maybe
congress
should
have
done
something
about
it,
but
congress
hasn't
provided
this
exemption.
it's
the
states
which
should
provided
the
exemption,
and
i
think
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we
should
construe
this
language
as
saying
that
congress
has
for
some
reason,
without
expressing
it,
adopted
a
state
exemption.
mr.
john
f.
davis
specifically,
it's
provided
a
transferee
liability.
mr.
john
f.
davis
specifically.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
right.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
when
--
but
when
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
legislative
history
of
the
inclusion
of
this
provision
and
the
estate
tax
said
that
they
were
not
enlarging
the
liability,
but
merely
making
it
specific.
