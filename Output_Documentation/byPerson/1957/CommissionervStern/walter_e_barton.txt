mr.
walter
e.
barton
mr.
barton.
mr.
openheim
is
in
the
next
case,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
before
--
mr.
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
attempting
to
argue
the
--
to
answer
the
argument
of
the
counsel
on
the
other
side,
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
our
contention
that
the
questions
argued
by
petitioner
are
not
properly
before
this
court.
the
only
question
in
the
tax
court
was
whether
the
petitioner
or
the
respondent
rather,
was
a
transferee
of
the
assets
of
the
estate
of
milton
j.
stern
deceased.
now,
that
appears
on
page
4
of
the
record
which
is
in
the
deficiency
letter
sent
to
mrs.
stern,
the
respondent.
and
then,
in
the
pleadings,
in
the
petition,
the
answer
and
the
reply
the
reference
is
made
25
times
i
believe
it
is
to
the
liability
of
the
respondent
as
transferee
of
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
and
that
is
what
the
tax
court
decided.
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
page
16
of
the
record,
it
is
argued
and
decided
that
the
petitioner
is
liable
as
transferee
of
the
estate
of
milton
j.
stern,
deceased.
now,
the
argument
has
been
addressed
to
the
proposition
of
whether
she
is
a
transferee
of
the
decedent.
of
course,
if
these
proceeds
had
been
paid
to
the
estate
and
turned
over
by
the
executor
to
mrs.
stern,
we've
never
would
have
gone
into
the
tax
court
because
necessarily,
she
would
have
been
a
transferee
there
of
assets
of
the
estate.
another
question
which
does
not
--
was
not
contended
for
in
the
tax
court
and
wasn't
raised
there
was
the
question
with
respect
to
the
cash
surrender
values
of
the
policies.
the
only
question
down
below
was
whether
or
not
she
was
liable
for
the
proceeds
of
the
insurance.
so
on
those
two
issues,
we
contend
that
those
questions
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
that.
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
i
don't
think
i
meant
to
say
that,
your
honor.
what
i
said
was
the
question
presented
to
the
tax
court
was
whether
the
petitioner
was
a
transferee
of
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
never
any
question
presented
the
tax
court
as
to
whether
she
was
a
transferee
of
the
decedent
himself,
and
of
course,
there
is
an
immense
difference
between
being
a
transferee
of
the
decedent
and
a
transferee
of
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
the
--
the
insurance
proceeds
never
were
paid
to
the
estate
and
as
i
said,
if
they
had
been
and
then
had
been
paid
over
to
this
widow
beneficiary,
we
never
would
even
gone
into
the
tax
court.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
the
tax
court
did
understand
that
i
--
i'm
sure
the
tax
court
understood
it
but
the
only
issue
presented
was
whether
she
was
a
transferee
of
the
estate
and
that's
what
the
tax
court
decided
in
the
order.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well
--
i
--
that
may
be
the
views,
your
honors,
but
i
don't
believe
it
is.
i
think
if
we
have
entirely
different
questions
in
the
case
as
to
whether
it's
a
transfer
of
property
in
the
form
of
proceeds
or
cash
surrender
values
from
the
decedent,
then
what
we
would
have
if
the
question
were
whether
she
was
a
transferee
of
the
estate
of
the
decedent.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
if
they
had
gone
in
the
estates
then
no
question
would
have
ever
risen,
because
necessarily
she
had
been
liable
if
the
estate
had
gotten
these
assets
and
turned
them
over
to
her.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
it
should
have
gone
to
the
estate
under
the
way
the
policy
was
set
up
because
the
policy
was
payable
to
the
--
to
the
insured's
beneficiary,
the
widow.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
then
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
of
course
the
government
doesn't
even
contend
they
were
in
his
estate.
they
--
they
only
argued
that
he
ought
to
change
the
beneficiaries
so
it
did
go
in
his
estate
the
way
i
understand
the
argument.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
the
cash
surrender
values
are
a
different
matter
of
course
that
--
the
cash
surrender
values
never
either
went
into
the
estates,
so
we'd
have
the
same
question
there.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
it
could
not
levy
on
it
after
his
death.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
it
couldn't
levy
on
it
after
his
death.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
i
think
i
said
4.
yes,
that's
the
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
page
4
in
the
first
paragraph,
constituting
your
liability
as
transferee
of
assets
to
the
estate
of
milton
j.
stern.
now,
most
--
assuming
the
questions
are
probably
before
the
court,
the
government's
argument
principally
is
predicated
on
the
theory
that
there's
the
same
kind
of
a
transfer
here
as
would
be
involved
in
the
case
of
a
estate
tax.
if
your
honors
care
to
turn
to
page
10
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
there
the
sections
of
the
estate
tax
law,
which
in
our
opinion
clearly
indicate
that
proceeds
of
insurance
were
not
the
property
of
the
decedent.
for
instance,
811
provides
that
the
gross
estates
shall
include
all
the
value
of
all
property
at
the
time
of
the
decedent's
death.
now,
in
811
(a),
to
the
extent
of
the
interest
therein
of
the
decedent
at
the
time
of
his
death.
now,
that
would
be
stocks
or
real
estate
or
something
he
might
own
that
would
go
to
his
heirs
or
to
his
executor.
now,
when
you
get
down
to
the
next
sections
about
life
insurance,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
interest
of
the
decedent
in
the
life
insurance.
it
says
to
the
extent
of
the
amount
receivable
by
all
other
beneficiaries
as
insurance
showing
that
congress
in
enacting
the
legislation
never
considered
that
the
decedent
had
an
--
a
property
interest
in
the
proceeds
of
life
insurance.
if
that
--
if
the
congress
have
so
considered,
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
have
incorporated
these
two
sections
about
proceeds
going
to
this
executor
or
proceeds
going
to
any
other
beneficiary.
now,
chief
justice
vinson,
when
he
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
john
hancock
life
insurance
case,
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
he
pointed
out
the
distinction
i
have
quoted
on
page
11
of
my
brief.
a
paragraph
of
his
opinion
in
which
he
shows
that
the
statute
has
two
lines
he
says.
one
is
the
interest
of
the
decedent
with
respect
to
property
which
he
makes
the
transfer.
the
other
is
insurance
which
goes
to
the
beneficiary
and
he
states
that
the
statute
proceeds
to
impose
a
lien
on
the
estate
property
to
the
extent
of
the
decedent's
interest
at
the
time
of
transfer
or
to
the
extent
of
the
beneficiary's
interest
under
the
insurance
contract.
so
it
isn't
necessary
and
this
--
in
the
--
it's
chase
national
bank
case
didn't
hold
that
there
was
a
transfer
of
life
insurance
proceeds
from
the
decedent
to
the
beneficiary.
in
that
case,
the
court
said,
it
was
the
termination
of
the
power
to
control
of
the
insured
over
the
policy
at
the
time
of
his
death
which
rendered
the
proceeds
includable
in
his
gross
estate.
not
because
he
owns
the
proceeds
and
by
imperative
reasoning
not
because
he
own
the
cash
surrender
values
but
because
at
his
death,
the
power
to
change
a
beneficiary
terminated
and
shifted
the
economic
benefit
of
that
policy
into
the
hands
of
the
beneficiary.
and
that
the
court
said
in
the
chase
national
bank
case
was
the
basis
for
the
tax.
now,
there
are
other
cases
where
there
are
properties
included
in
the
gross
estate
which
the
decedent
doesn't
own
a
property
in
at
the
time
of
his
death.
for
instance,
transfers
in
contemplation
of
death
maybe
made
years
before.
revocable
transfers
and
interests
in
joint
tenancies
or
tenancies
by
the
entireties.
they're
all
segregated
in
the
estate
tax
law,
separate
and
apart
from
the
one
section
that
refers
to
property
in
which
the
decedent
has
an
interest
showing
that
all
kinds
of
properties
may
be
included
in
the
gross
estates
including
life
insurance
proceeds
with
respect
to
which
the
decedent
didn't
own
a
property
interest
up
to
time
of
his
death.
now,
then
the
eight
and
the
ninth
circuits
in
two
different
cases
each
which
i
have
cited
on
page
12
of
the
brief
have
held
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
transfer
rendering
property
includable
in
the
gross
estate
at
the
time
of
death
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
transferee
liability
and
in
income
tax
case.
and
in
fact,
in
that
case,
it
was
a
tenancy
by
the
entirety
and
joint
tenancies
and
they
said
there
wasn't
any
property
interest
that
went
to
the
survivor
which
constituted
property
under
section
311
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
admitted
that
they
couldn't
get
certain
property
and
the
joint
names
of
the
decedent
and
its
widow
that
is
some
bonds
and
some
real
estate.
now,
those
properties
were
includable
in
the
gross
estate
just
same
as
insurance.
so
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
distinction
between
properties
of
that
kind
and
life
insurance.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
life
insurance
is
--
policy
is
a
contract
where
the
insured
pays
a
premium
in
consideration
for
the
payment
of
proceeds
to
his
beneficiary.
as
soon
as
that
policy
is
signed,
the
insurance
company
is
liable
for
the
full
amount
if
the
insured
dies
the
next
day
which
demonstrates,
we
think
that
when
the
insurance
company
pays
the
proceeds,
the
insurance
company
pays
its
own
money
and
it
doesn't
pay
anything
that
belongs
to
the
insured.
now,
as
justice
harlan
this
morning
pointed
out
all
five
circuit
courts
of
appeals
which
are
passive
on
this
question
have
held
that
there's
no
transfer
of
proceeds
and
there's
been
no
circuit
court
of
appeals
that's
held
of
the
contrary.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
that's
the
proceeds
of
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
transferee
section
of
the
income
tax
law,
section
311.
now,
i
like
just
to
make
one
statement
before
proceeding
a
little
further,
i
understood
the
counsel
to
say
that
the
record
showed
that
the
insured
paid
the
premiums
up
to
the
day
of
his
death.
the
record
doesn't
show
in
any
respect
who
paid
the
premiums
or
how
long.
it
shows
that
these
policies
were
taken
out
in
getting
about
1910
up
to
about
1935.
and
the
widow,
the
respondent
here
was
made
beneficiary
in
1919,
after
they
married
and
she's
made
beneficiary
in
the
last
policy
in
1935.
he
died
in
1939.
there's
no
change
in
beneficiary
between
1949.
there's
no
--
no
change
in
beneficiary
from
the
time
these
--
from
1935
up
to
the
day
of
his
death.
now,
these
tax
years
are
1944
to
1947.
the
court
of
appeals
below
made
the
statement
that
there's
no
evidence
of
insolvency
before
death.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
took
out
these
policies
or
maintained
them
to
defraud,
defeat
the
creditors.
and
i
would
say
further
there's
no
evidence
whatever
in
the
case
as
to
whether
the
insured
paid
any
premium
from
these
policies
during
the
taxable
years
1944
to
1947,
or
after
that
--
after
the
date
of
his
death.
and
as
to
all
of
that,
the
government
has
a
burden
of
proof
under
section
1119
(a)
because
the
government
has
a
burden
of
proving
transferee
liability
and
the
burden
is
not
on
the
taxpayer.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
the
cash
surrender
value,
it's
been
in
the
record.
let's
say
there
are
--
i
think
about
$27,000.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
i
think
there
are
about
(inaudible)
$47,000.
the
cash
surrender
value
is
$27,000
and
the
proceeds
are
$47,000.
now,
that's
on
page
13
of
the
record.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
there's
no
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever.
as
i
stated,
there
was
a
--
this
case
went
to
the
tax
court
on
a
stipulation
principally
and
there
was
no
evidence,
no
statement
made
in
the
stipulation
as
to
who
paid
the
premiums
or
how
long
the
period.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
for
all
you
know,
she
might
have
paid
them
or
for
all
we
know,
he
may
have
paid
them
all
in
a
lump
sum
in
the
beginning
as
far
as
the
evidence
goes.
now,
the
tax
court
said
in
the
opinion
they
assumed
that
he
paid
the
premiums
because
we
stipulated,
he
took
out
the
policies
but
there's
no
evidence,
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
who
paid
the
premiums
and
i
say
the
burden
is
on
the
government
under
a
case
of
this
kind
and
the
government
never
produced
any
evidence
with
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
the
tax
court
assumed
that
he
paid
the
premiums.
i
don't
believe
they
said
up
to
the
date
of
his
death.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
i
don't
like
to
say,
i
don't
like
to
admit
something
that
isn't
in
the
records,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
it
isn't
in
the
record
he
paid
them.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
the
tax
court
said
that
it
was
stipulated
that
dr.
stern
took
out
the
policies.
therefore,
we
assume
he
paid
the
premiums.
that's
what
the
tax
court
said.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
(voice
overlap)
--
if
he
turned
this
property
over
to
the
widow
with
the
rights
to
revoke
it
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well
your
honor
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
i
--
i
don't
believe
it
would
and
here's
the
case
that
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
find
until
after
a
brief
was
filed,
a
decision
of
this
court
in
jones
versus
clinton.
quite
an
old
case
but
i
think
it's
sound,
101
u.s.
225.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
that's
right,
101
u.s.225.
now,
the
bankrupt
made
a
voluntary
assignment
of
all
of
these
assets.
now,
prior
to
the
assignment,
i
don't
know
how
long
before
but
prior
to
that
time
and
i
don't
believe
there's
any
evidence,
while
the
evidence
was,
he
was
solvent
when
he
did
it.
he
gave
a
deed
to
his
wife
of
certain
real
estate
and
also
included
in
this
deed,
certain
life
insurance
policies
but
he
kept
in
the
deed
a
power
to
revoke
it
and
take
it
back
or
a
power
to
appoint
it.
now,
the
question
was
whether
when
he
made
the
assignment
of
all
of
his
assets
to
the
assignee.
that
included
his
power
of
revocation
of
that
assignment
to
his
wife.
this
court
held
it
did
not.
this
court
said
that
power
is
not
an
interest
in
property
which
can
be
transferred
to
another
or
sold
on
execution
or
devised
by
will.
the
grantor
could
indeed
escape
the
power
either
by
deed
or
will,
but
he
could
not
best
power
in
any
other
person.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
that
would
be,
yes,
because
--
yes
your
honor,
the
bank
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
the
bankruptcy
law
today
provides
that
shall
--
the
bankrupt
shall
have
title
to
all
of
the
trustees,
title
to
all
property
and
that
there
shall
be
included
all
of
the
bankrupt's
powers
which
he
can
exercise
for
his
own
benefit.
so,
that
would
be
carried
to
the
present
time.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
i
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
the
reason,
your
honor
is
of
course,
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
policy
it
would
have
in
the
savings
bank,
but
the
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
the
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
the
insured
on
a
level
premium
payment
plan
as
the
counsel
this
morning
stated
pays
more
in
the
early
years
in
the
cost
of
mortality.
the
laws
of
the
state
require
a
solvency
reserve,
which
is
the
excess
over
the
level
premium
over
the
--
over
the
cost
mortality
and
then
with
the
accumulation
of
interest.
now,
the
cash
surrender
value
might
be
equivalent
to
the
reserve
or
maybe
like
deduct
the
cancelation
charge,
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
reserve
doesn't
mean
that
the
insured
owns
that
reserve
fund.
now,
if
the
insured
wants
to
borrow
money
from
the
insurance
company,
it
comes
out
of
the
reserve.
he's
got
to
pay
an
--
he
got
to
pay
an
interest
on
that.
now,
if
that
were
his
own
money,
he
wouldn't
have
paid
any
interest
on
it.
and
the
reserve
fund
under
the
law
and
investment
of
the
insurance
company,
accumulates
interests.
who
pays
an
income
tax
without
interest?
it
isn't
the
insured
causing
interest
that
goes
into
that
reserve
fund
belongs
to
the
insurance
company.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
that's
right.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
now,
the
insured
has
a
right
to
recover
the
cash
surrender
value
of
his
policy
if
he
surrenders
his
policy.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
i
believe
that
your
honor
is
incorrect
in
that.
now,
i
have
cited
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
yes,
but
you
don't
own
that
until
you
surrender
your
policy.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
yes,
but
you
can't
get
it
except
to
surrender
your
policy
and
terminate
your
contract
insurance.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
that's
right.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
you
own
that
cash
surrender
value.
you've
got
to
surrender
for
the
cash
surrender
value
policy.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
yes,
well,
that
is
--
that
is
true
perhaps,
your
honor,
but
then
the
question
gets
around
to
the
proposition
of
whether
the
cash
surrender
value
passes
to
the
beneficiary
at
the
time
of
the
decedent's
death.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
if
they
had
made
an
assessment,
then
a
lien
automatically
would
have
attached
to
all
of
his
property
and
i
would
say
an
insurance
policy
is
a
property.
now,
first
in
this
case,
this
tax
wasn't
assessed
until
almost
six
years
after
he
died
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
the
deficiency.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
it
--
yes,
it's
approved
before
his
death.
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
that.
now
then,
we
--
we
have
in
our
brief
contended,
there
is
no
transfer
of
the
cash
surrender
value
or
the
proceeds.
i
don't
believe
the
government
contends
very
seriously
about
the
proceeds.
the
question
there
is
the
beneficiary,
a
transferee
of
property
of
a
taxpayer.
now,
they
argue
that
by
analogy,
you
can
go
to
the
transferee
section
under
estate
tax
law.
well,
the
transferee
section
in
the
estate
tax
and
the
income
tax
law
both
originated
in
1926.
they
read
exactly
the
same
way
except
in
income
tax,
it
said
that
the
property
of
the
taxpayer
and
the
other
said
property
of
the
decedent.
now,
in
1918,
was
the
first
time
that
life
insurance
is
brought
into
the
estate
tax.
and
in
the
same
law,
they
made
the
beneficiary
of
the
policy
personally
liable
for
the
tax
to
the
extent
of
the
proceeds
produced
the
estate
tax.
now,
that
was
1918.
in
1926,
the
transferee
provision
in
both
sections
of
the
law
were
put
into
effect,
and
it
was
not
until
1942
that
congress
amended
the
estate
tax
section
and
brought
in
a
beneficiary
of
an
insurance
policy
although
that
beneficiary
had
been
liable
all
these
years
from
1918
and
of
course
in
1926
where
the
transferee
section
was
first
enacted
they
amended
the
law
and
made
the
beneficiary
subject
to
the
summary
process
of
assessment,
but
that
amendment
did
not
make
the
beneficiary
viable
for
the
tax.
the
beneficiary
is
already
liable
under
the
former
section
and
here
under
827
(b),
the
beneficiary
is
liable.
so,
we
say
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
rowen
case
in
new
york
said,
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
changed
the
law
in
the
income
tax
showed
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
produce
the
same
result
that
they
did
in
the
estate
tax
when
they
did
amend
the
law.
now,
then
if
we
should
be
wrong
--
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
the
liability
of
the
beneficiary
of
life
insurance
was
already
existent
in
the
case
of
the
estate
taxes,
it
had
been
from
1918.
so,
all
congress
did
in
1942
was
not
to
make
the
beneficiary
liable
but
to
bring
the
beneficiary
under
that
summary
procedure.
mr.
walter
e.
barton
well,
if
you
should
hold
that
she
is
a
transferee
then
we've
got
to
find
out
what
is
the
transferee
liability.
and
there,
we
say,
you
have
to
look
at
estate
law.
now,
the
only
court
that's
held
that
state
law
doesn't
apply
is
in
the
bess
case
which
is
going
to
be
argued
right
away
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
that
too
much,
but
that
new
jersey
law
was
almost
word
for
word
like
the
kentucky
law
and
the
third
circuit
in
the
bess
case
said
that
if
you
look
to
the
state
law
of
new
jersey.
the
widow
beneficiary
is
not
liable
for
the
tax
of
the
decedent
but
the
court
in
the
bess
case
says
you
don't
look
to
state
law,
you
look
to
general
law,
but
i
don't
know
where
you
look
for
the
general
law.
that's
what
the
court
said
up
in
the
rowen
case.
the
third
circuit
didn't
point
out
any
law
you
looked
to
but
we
say
that
you
got
to
look
the
state
law
under
the
kentucky
law.
there's
no
liability.
