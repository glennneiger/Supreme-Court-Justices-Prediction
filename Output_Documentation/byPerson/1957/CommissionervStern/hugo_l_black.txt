yes.
is
there
any
difference
between
the
transfer
of
the
estate
of
the
deceased,
transfer
of
assets
of
the
estate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
said
was
the
transfer
of
the
assets
--
the
transferee
of
assets
(inaudible).
i
presume
they
met
by
that
if
that's
the
policy

justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
the
government's
right

it's
the
government's
right
to
trust

they
will
transfer

(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
cash
surrender
value
on
the
day
of
his
death?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
payment
of
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
instead
of
insurance
$40,000
worth
of
personal
property
has
been
turned
over
to
a
custodian.
then
he
understands
that
the
payment
back
if
the
man
wanted
to
pay
at
the
time
of
his
death,
$27,000
surrendered
over.
otherwise,
he
was

would
there
be
any
difference
from
your
position
--
turned
over
to
the
widow

justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
it's
just
--
sure.
turned
it
over
to
a
custodian
$40,000
(inaudible)
and
with
the
understanding
that
it
goes
to
the
widow
because
he
doesn't
take
anything
back
from
--
before
he
died.
but
then
after
the
very
moment
of
his
death,
he
can
get
in
fact,
$27,000
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
difference
so
far
as
the
legal
question
that
you're
arguing?
justice
hugo
l.

225?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
his,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
his
because
i've
always
thought
of
my
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can
get
it
today
if
i
happen
to
have
a
policy
that
has

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
have
the
money
in
my
hand
but
if
the
company
is
any
good,
i've
got
the
right
to
give
right
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
(inaudible)
equivalent
of
the
cash
surrender
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
whatever
maybe
--
whatever
the
cash

lifetime,

looked
to

black
but
require

owed

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
argument
--
that
argument
does
depend
on
whether
she
is
a
transferee
or
not,
does
it?
but
you're
saying
there
is
that
congress
is
taking
hold
of
this
thing
and
legislate
it
but
they
didn't
choose
to
pose
a
liability
under

then
is
your
case

on
whether
we
agree
with

that
she's
not
a
