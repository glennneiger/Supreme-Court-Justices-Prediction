justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
know
there
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
trust
fund
doctrine
that
you
say
isn't
a
derogative
of
any
provisions
of
the
tax
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
--
you
get
it
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
switching
sizes
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
and
you
climb
up
against
the
state
and
federal
law
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
where
do
you
get
it
because
you
have
answered
impliedly
that
federal
law
prevails,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
federal
law
is
taken
out
of
the
interior,
is
it,
common
law
interior?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
assumed
the
contrary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
elizabeth
the
second.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
transfer
made?
you
have
to
fix
a
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
--
which
derived
from
fraud,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
say,
that
doctrine
has
bloomed
and
blossomed
and
grown
so
that
now
fraud
is
a
fiction
and
by
operation
of
law,
she
gets
the
benefit
which
she
ultimately
hold
on
to
because
he
died
insolvent,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
her
right
--
her
right
originated
way
back,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
tentative
right.
you
say
that,
when
he
died
insolvent,
he
should
have
exercised
the
power
of
appointment
in
favor
of
uncle
sam
as
the
tax
collector.
that's
really
what
this
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
what
the
law
will
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
use
the
same
kind
of
the
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
(inaudible)
transfer
here
is
a
remedial
enforcement
of
some
governments
part,
there
somebody
who
got
something
in
case
of
death
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)[laugh]
justice
felix

liabilities
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
at
the
time
the
inference
was
created,
there
is
no
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
insured.
i'm
talking
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
things
that
have
life
that
full
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
congress
has
done
nothing
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suggestion
that
should
have
gone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
is
that
it
should
have
gone
in
the
estate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
174
the
tax
(inaudible)
that
he
paid
the
premiums
during
the
years
when
his
estate
is
depleted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
why
--
or
through
the
premiums,
he
pleaded
as
a
estate
or
surrendered
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
for
all
we
know,
she
might
have
paid
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis
said
that
we
may
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
assumption
of
trying
to
put
out
the
policy
if
he
was
not
himself
--
on
the
same
basis
of
the
two
--
although
the
evidence
in
the
record
doesn't
disclose
it.
that
he
paid
the
premiums
(inaudible)
the
right
of
the
policy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
assumption
that
she
might
have
paid
them
is
not
to
be
entertained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it's
in
the
record
that
he
pays
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not.
but
they
made
that
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barton,
may
i
assume
justice
black's
question
in
a
more
practical
if
i
may
say
so
or
more
concrete
aspect
in
massachusetts
and
in
one
or
two
other
states
that
you
are
(inaudible).
in
massachusetts,
one
of
the
key
--
no,
one
of
the
important
source
of
insurance
writing
is
through
the
savings
bank.
they
are
authorized
and
have
been
for
now
what,
30
odd
years
or
more.
writing
insurance
on
the
theory
that
insurance
is
nothing
but
a
form
of
savings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
has
the
basis
of
it
in
the
vast
amount
as
you
probably
know,
a
very
great
deal
of
insurance
is
written
through
the
savings
bank
of
massachusetts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
between
another
form
of
the
general
question
that
justice
black
asked,
as
in
this
to
be
treated
like
money
in
the
borrowing
savings
bank
or
whatever
savings
bank
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you'll
have
somebody,
your
beneficiary
will
file
the
revocation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
fund
of
course,
there's
no
trust
fund
in
any
sense
of
a
reach
in
which
part
of
it
is
mine
but
that's
no
more
--
that's
equally
true
or
untrue
of
a
savings
bank
account
and
any
of
the
savings
bank.
nobody
owns
an
adequate
cost
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
actual
money
in
the
vault.
