mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
was
instituted
in
the
district
court
of
harris
county,
texas
on
the
27th
day
of
august
1953
in
behalf
of
a
(inaudible)
seaman
and
engineer
on
a
motor
vessel
j.c.
stephens
owned
and
operated
by
the
respondent
magnolia
petroleum
company.
this
action
was
removed
by
way
of
plea
of
privileged
to
the
district
court
of
dallas
county
where
the
trial
was
held.
the
pleadings
in
sort
of
orthodox
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
in
houston.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
the
state
court
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
--
and
removed
to
the
state
court
of
dallas
county.
the
pleadings
in
sort
of
orthodox
fashion
alleged
unseaworthiness
and
negligence.
before
trial,
the
respondent
interposed
a
plea
of
limitation
both
to
the
action
under
the
jones
act
and
to
the
action
which
petitioner
here
claims
is
also
under
the
jones
act
but
under
the
principles
of
the
maritime
law
that
proceeded
the
jones
act.
the
theory
of
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
was
that
when
the
jones
act
was
enacted,
a
two-year
limitation
statute
prevailed
and
when
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
limitation
provisional
was
increased
to
three
years,
it
did
not
apply
because
it
was
not
specifically
provided
in
the
extension
as
to
the
jones
act.
and
also,
stated
and
urged
below
that
the
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness
has
been
barred
by
limitation
because
the
two-year
texas
limitation
statute
applied
and
not
the
two-year
statute.
the
trial
court
overruled
after
hearing
both
of
these
pleas
and
trial
was
held
on
the
merits.
at
the
trial
and
conformity
with
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
applicable
in
the
state
court
of
texas,
special
issues
or
interrogatories
were
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
jury
found
first
that
petitioner
did
receive
any
injury
to
his
body
while
attempting
to
walk
down
a
set
--
a
set
of
stairs
leading
from
a
lounge
to
the
galley
below
which
he
had
to
go
in
order
to
reach
the
engine
room
where
he
was
employed
as
an
engineer.
the
jury
also
found
one
of
the
allegations
urged
by
the
petitioner
that
the
portholes
over
the
stairs
from
which
he
fell
were
not
watertight
causing
seawater
to
come
in
and
making
them
dangerous
causing
his
fall.
the
jury
found
that
the
portholes
or
windows
over
these
stairs
were
not
watertight.
petitioner
insisted
that
the
inquiry
immediately
following
this
inquiry
should
be
was
such
on
seaway
the
condition
or
was
such
failure
to
have
these
portholes
watertight
approximate
cause
of
petitioner
to
the
injuries
on
the
theory
of
that.
once
the
unseaworthy
action
or
the
effect
has
been
found
the
unseaworthiness
follows
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
next
one
is
just
a
question
of
approximate
cause.
the
court
refused
to
submit
such
an
issue
and
instead
asked
the
jury
whether
that
failure
to
have
these
portholes
or
windows
watertight
rendered
the
vessel
unseaworthy
then
gave
a
definition
over
the
objections
of
petitioner
stating
you
are
instructed
that
by
the
term
unseaworthy
as
used
herein
means
that
a
vessel
with
it's
appliances
and
the
fittings
is
not
reasonably
fit
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
being
used.
petitioner
objected
first
that
there
was
an
unnecessary
question
of
the
jury
whether
or
not
that
led
the
vessel
unseaworthy.
and
secondly,
stated
that
if
the
court
was
to
submit
such
an
inquiry
then
the
definition
is
erroneous
because
it
emplaces
a
greater
burden
than
the
one
upon
petitioner,
than
the
one
required
by
law,
because
the
definition
requires
the
jury
to
find
that
by
reason
of
that
failure
to
have
these
portholes
or
windows
watertight.
the
vessel
as
a
whole
is
unseaworthy
whereas
the
burden
upon
us
was
to
show
that
that
particular
port
of
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
approximately
causing
injury.
the
court
refused
to
do
so
and
refused
to
do
so
on
a
similar
issue
inquiring
about
whether
or
not
the
deck
above
the
galley
was
watertight,
(inaudible)
shows
that
it
wasn't
and
submitted
the
same
type
of
issues.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
particularly
i
say
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
in
that
setting
specifically
that
portholes
were
not
watertight
and
water
would
come
through,
the
largest
are
from
the
stairs
that
the
deck
above
the
galley
was
not
watertight,
that
water
would
come
through
and
lodge
itself
on
the
steps
very
specifically
set
out.
then
i
made
the
same
objections
and
the
same
exceptions
and
requested
the
same
definitions
with
reference
to
question
number
14
but
of
course
the
same
result.
the
jury,
however,
was
not
15
minutes
and
send
an
inquiry
to
the
court
saying
judge
long
does
the
term
unseaworthy
refer
to
the
vessel
as
a
whole
or
to
the
three
portholes
or
three
windows
above
the
galley,
the
specific
question.
the
court
refused
to
answer
to
that
stating,
“we
the
court,
the
charge
contains
all
destructions
and
definitions.”
jury
of
layman
naturally
answered
the
question
of
unseaworthiness
no,
that
a
jury
was
confused.
it's
so
clear
by
the
issue
that
they've
send
out
that
at
least
no
room
for
that
otherwise
they
would
have
never
send
that
very
cautioned
and
intelligent
question
out.
again,
when
the
jury
send
out
that
question
in
conformity
with
our
practice,
are
requested
in
writing
that
a
court
issue,
answer
the
jury
the
question
that
in
connection
with
your
answer,
you
are
instructed
that
we
have
referenced
to
the
portholes
over
the
stairs
leading
from
the
lounge
to
the
galley.
the
court
refused
it
at
that
time
again,
i
asked
for
a
definite
definition
particularly
pinpointing
as
the
court
should
that
the
defect
we
were
talking
about
was
not
the
vessel
as
a
whole
but
the
specific
windows
and
the
specific
deck
above
the
galley
the
court
again
refused.
the
jury
found
acquitted
defendant
that
the
respondent
here
of
all
negligence
bound
$22,500
for
the
damages
and
some
$6000
plus
for
maintenance.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
no,
that's
exactly
the
way
i've
requested.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
by
the
definition.
yes,
sir,
as
clearly
illustrated
by
the
jury
this
question.
now
--
no,
it's
not
a
--
justice
harlan,
it
is
not
as
i've
shown
a
specification
over
--
on
page
number
35.
i
say
that
was
unnecessary
once
they
answer
on
the
jury
was
requested
and
answer
specification
number
two
as
it's
not
in
my
brief,
it
appears
on
page
384
of
the
record.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
384
of
the
record
itself.
i
objected
to
that
part
of
the
issue
that
appeared
on
page
35
of
my
brief
because
i
find
it
wholly
unnecessary
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
particularly
putman
versus
united
states
and
many
other
cases.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
number
three.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
said
in
view
of
number
two
immediately
proceeding
number
three.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
number
three
was
not
necessary.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir,
i'm
getting
to
that
immediately
next
of
i
--
i
think.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
thank
you,
sir.
i
say
that
--
that
the
method
of
submitting
that
issue
itself
put
--
deprived
petitioner
of
the
federally
created
right.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
of
limitation,
i
approached
the
question
of
limitation
on
two
grounds.
one
that
the
jones
act
was
an
all
inclusive
statute
that
it
took
in
all
personal
injuries
suffered
by
seaman
and
when
once
the
congress
has
passed
an
act,
providing
that
all
personal
injuries,
the
statute
shall
be
three
years,
that
is
controlling
otherwise
the
--
we
have
a
judicial
chameleon
that
changes
these
color
as
accordance
with
the
topography
or
geography
of
the
country.
it
would
be
ridiculous,
i
submit,
that
a
seaman
in
texas
must
--
would
lose
his
law
suit
that
he
bought
--
cause
he
bought
it
after
two
years
but
one
in
new
york
can
recover
because
he
bought
it
in
three
years
and
one
in
louisiana
would
lose
it
because
he
didn't
bring
within
one
year.
secondly,
we
have
the
statute
with
reference
to
analogy.
now,
if
analogy
is
to
be
had
and
by
the
way
respondent
pleaded
last
year
so
we
--
petitioner
pleaded
by
way
of
protection
incursion
excused
from
last
year.
and
it
was
shown
there
that
all
of
the
witnesses
that
were
present
at
the
time
of
the
injury
were
present
and
testified
at
the
trial
of
the
case
that
this
man
was
kept
on
the
employ
of
the
employer
for
a
period
of
--
of
almost
two
and
a
half
years.
so
a
good
grant
of
excuse
were
present
to
excuse
delay
if
delay
is
in
the
case
and
i
submit
there
is.
secondly,
as
they
were
own
questionably
there
was
no
prejudice
to
the
respondent
here.
now,
i
submit
that
a
case
that
i
haven't
cited
but
recently
where
again
lindgren
versus
united
states
decided
by
this
court
many
years
ago
its
38
--
281
u.s.
38
and
the
appellate
court
decision
is
28
f.2d
125.
in
that
case,
lindgren
sued
the
united
states
and
that
was
--
and
sought
under
both
negligence
or
on
--
and
unseaworthiness
and
it
was
sued
for
the
death,
lindgren
died
leaving
no
beneficiaries
which
could
take
under
the
provisions
of
the
jones
act
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
district
court
allowed
them
$5000
damages
to
who
--
to
the
administrator
under
the
--
on
the
virginia
statute,
i
believe,
because
under
the
virginia
statue,
you
did
not
have
to
have
this
class
of
beneficiaries
in
order
to
see
the
recovery.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
saying
that
congress
has
spoken
in
enacting
the
jones
act
which
sets
out
exactly
who
the
beneficiaries
are
and
since
questionably
these
beneficiaries
were
not
existent,
he
can
recover.
but
counsel
for
the
petitioner
(inaudible)
took
the
position
that
this
is
also
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness
which
the
jones
act
does
not
cover
and
therefore
the
state
statute
applies
which
does
allow
recovery.
but
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
not
so
the
court
has
spoken
clearly
to
congress
--
congress
has
spoken
clearly
saying
that
you
cannot
recover
unless
you
have
these
class
of
beneficiaries
there
and
since
they're
not
existent,
it
matters
not
whether
you
recover
under
unseaworthiness
or
under
the
jones
act
by
way
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
lindgren
versus
u.s.
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
it's
281
u.s.
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
--
38,
28
f.2d
125.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
--
i
thought
i
had
it
but
i
checked
it
this
morning
when
i
saw
it,
i
did
not
but
i
think
it's
a
relevant
decision
and
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
texas
is
correct
then
lindgren
versus
u.s.
is
wrong
for
this
reason.
in
lindgren
versus
u.s.
this
court
have
said,
the
congress
had
passed
an
act
applicable
to
jones
act
actions
which
prohibits
recovery
unless
these
class
of
beneficiaries
are
alive
and
it
matters
not
that
you
come
in
here
and
say
that
you
proceeded
under
unseaworthiness.
the
reason
of
--
the
parallel
i
think
is
clear
if
the
--
the
argument
is
made
that
a
plea
of
statue
of
limitation
applies
only
to
the
jones
act
then
lindgren
versus
u.s.
is
wrong
because
they
say
it
matters
not.
if
the
provisional
beneficiaries
in
the
jones
act
is
applicable
then
the
provision
of
the
limitation
of
clear
limitation
is
applicable
more
over
this
court
time
and
time
again
as
stated
that
section
688
title
46
applies
to
all
maritime
causes
of
action.
i
say
that
is
the
fault
of
the
courts
to
some
extent
primarily
the
fault
of
the
lawyers
that
fell
into
a
mail
saying
over
and
over
again
that
the
jones
act
is
a
negligence
statute.
i
say
and
i
urge
this
court
to
see
that
the
jones
act
is
not
merely
a
negligence
statute,
where
you
couldn't
proceed
under
the
fela
to
impose
liability
under
the
safety
appliance
act
which
certainly
is
a
non-negligence
statute.
this
similarity
is
exactly
the
same
and
of
course
this
similarity
in
my
position
is
supported
by
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
kernan
versus
the
american
dredging
company
decided
i
believe
january
27,
1958
by
this
court.
and
this
--
since
i
like
to
have
about
a
few
minutes
to
reply,
i
say
that
a
statute
of
limitation
enacted
by
congress
in
three
year
is
applicable
to
all
causes
of
action
by
--
urged
by
a
seaman
in
the
event
of
personal
injuries
since
congress
has
decreed
that
otherwise
the
uniformity
of
the
matter
would
be
seriously
impaired.
secondly,
the
issues
submitted
by
the
trial
court
below
has
impaired
and
prevented
the
sea
--
the
seaman
of
appealing
its
federally
created
right
and
a
method
on
which
they
were
committed
and
this
court
has
very
reasonably
also
and
there
are
no
case
held
that
a
state
court
cannot
by
its
practice
and
procedure
deprive
a
citizen
of
its
federally
created
right.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
it
is
my
opinion
and
i
certainly
strongly
urge
the
court
to
also
speak
on
my
second
point,
which
is
the
proper
submission
of
the
definition
of
unseaworthiness.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
the
court
of
appeal
never
reached
that
point,
that's
true
but
as
much
as
it
is
a
great
honor
for
any
lawyers
certainly
for
me
to
appear
before
this
court,
i
would
not
want
to
come
back
on
this
case
again.
i
--
i
think
this
court
ought
to
also
pronounce
the
rights
of
--
of
this
litigant
on
the
second
question.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
they
might.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
think
justice
frankfurter
that
the
facts
made
that
the
undisputed
questions
by
both
counsel
here
raises
the
second
question
without
the
necessity
of
going
through
like
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
but
that's
appearing
from
the
record
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
from
i
mean
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
think
so.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
no,
sir,
you
can
go
ahead
on
the
analogy
matter
but
i
--
i
do
honestly
believe
it
does,
but
the
court
--
the
court
can
do
one
hold
that
the
congress
having
spoken
that
a
two-year
statute
applies
to
seaman
receiving
personal
injury
that
--
that's
controlling
on
all
states.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
i
understand
that
--
and
i
would
find
the
help
as
much
as
i
can
by
my
being
here
in
my
brief,
that's
number
one.
number
two
this
court
can
say
we
find
that
no
prejudices
existed
and
if
any
analogy
is
to
be
followed,
a
two-year
statute
enacted
by
congress
since
it's
a
federally
created
right.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
there
--
there
was
no
federal
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
two
years,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
states
statutes
so
provide
because
there
was
no
federal
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
well,
sir
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
that's
exactly
the
case
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
and
this
court
has
so
held
with
reference
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
(inaudible)
court
just
held
this.
i
thank
you.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
mr.
mandell,
you
may
proceed.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
--
i
think
perhaps
i
maybe
of
aid
to
the
court
in
reference
to
the
history
of
the
legislation.
i
have
checked
that
and
found
no
history
of
legislation
except
this.
this
court
decided
arizona
versus
(inaudible)
of
1942
or
1943
or
that
about
i
believe.
in
that
case,
a
seaman
sued
under
the
jones
act
for
personal
injuries
and
the
attorney
for
the
steamship
company
very
advertly
i
thought
came
back
and
interpose
the
plea
of
assumption
of
risk
stating
that
if
they
are
going
to
take
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
total,
they
can
take
only
the
good
and
not
the
bad.
it
would
be
bad
and
the
--
at
that
time,
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
i'm
sorry
was
page
6,
i
believe.
the
doctrine
of
assumption
of
risk
could've
been
applied
because
the
law
hasn't
been
amended
since
1939.
this
court
and
the
court
below
rejected
that
argument
stating
this
that
the
jones
act
was
not
meant
to
limit
the
rights
that
a
seaman
had
under
the
maritime
law
but
why
don't
you
enlarged
it
that
a
jones
act
wasn't
drafted
on
the
maritime
law
or
which
it
became
apart
and
i
say
therefore
that
while
this
court
had
never
had
this
question
brought
out
before
directly
the
question
of
limitation
except
in
engel
versus
davenport
which
this
court
particularly
states
we
need
not
pass
from
the
question
whether
the
jones
act
period
of
limitation
applies
on
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness
because
we
don't
have
it
before.
but
in
that
case
in
the
arizona
versus
(inaudible)
case,
this
court
stated
that
a
right
that
they
had
the
--
the
jones
act
do
not
afford
the
right
to
avoid
the
assumption
of
risk
defense
nevertheless
it's
right
that
they
had
an
admiralty
and
it's
embraced
and
continued
and
became
a
part
of
the
jones
act
as
i
believe
was
a
right
of
unseaworthiness
and
the
statute
of
limitation
under
the
jones
act
became
a
part
of
the
jones
act.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
partially
right.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
don't
agree
with
--
i
don't
agree
with
you
justice
frankfurter.
i
was
saying
that
it
was
desired
by
congress.
congress
simply
did
enact.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
i
say
that
local
law
must
apply
in
the
absence
of
--
of
congressional
action
or
(voice

--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
if
known
action
means
policy.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
if
non-action
means
policy,
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur

mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.

thank
you

mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
except
--
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
arthur
j.
mandell
yes,
justice
frankfurter,
the
very
language
of
the
statute
(voice

--
mr.

thank
you
very
much.
