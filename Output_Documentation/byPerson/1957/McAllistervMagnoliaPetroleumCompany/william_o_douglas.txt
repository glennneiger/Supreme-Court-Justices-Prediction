justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
your
main
question
here
was
the
statute
of
limitation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
have
very
much
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
name
of
the
case
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
did
you
cite
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
not
in
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
it's
based
on
both
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
gathered
then
i
suppose,
he
must
proceed
within
the
two
years
or
his
--
takes
his
chance
of
losing
out.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
a
practical
matter,
we
have
something
here
that
implicates
only
the
unseaworthiness
but
ordinary
negligence
suit
under
the
jones
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
a
rather
--
rather
direct
bearing
upon
them
too,
i
would
think.
