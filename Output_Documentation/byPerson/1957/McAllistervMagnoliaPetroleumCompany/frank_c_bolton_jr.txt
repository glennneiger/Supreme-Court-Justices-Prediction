mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
our
argument
primarily
almost
solely
to
the
question
of
limitations.
mr.
mandell
has
in
a
large
manner
made
summary
of
the
jury
findings.
there
were
some
34
special
interrogatories
submitted
and
only
15
of
which
were
required
to
be
answered
to
arrive
at
the
verdict
which
the
jury
found
because
some
of
the
issues
were
conditionally
submitted
upon
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
a
preceding
issue.
the
jury
exonerated
the
respondent
from
any
act
of
negligence.
they
did
it
specifically
with
reference
to
the
specific
acts
about
which
inquiry
was
made
and
it
did
so
generally
by
finding
that
the
injuries
resulted
from
an
unavoidable
accident.
the
seaworthy
issues
were
submitted
as
requested
by
counsel
except
insofar
as
he
has
outlined
here.
the
jury
found
the
condition
existed
but
that
the
condition
did
not
constitute
unseaworthiness
and
under
the
court's
instructions
they
were
not
then
required
to
determine
the
approximate
cause
issue
which
followed.
now,
to
make
my
point
as
to
the
applicable
statute
of
limitation,
it
is
i
think
necessary
to
go
to
the
historical
backgrounds
or
a
brief
summary
at
least
so
long
since
the
(inaudible)
or
back
in
the
early
days
of
this
court.
the
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness
as
a
condition
has
been
recognized
as
a
matter
of
national
law.
the
unseaworthiness
in
that
since
is
a
condition
without
regard
as
to
why
the
condition
existed.
the
cause
of
action
then
that
a
seaman
had
under
that
law
depended
merely
upon
him
showing
that
the
condition
existed
and
not
showing
how
it
came
about.
with
the
enactment
of
the
jones
act
in
1920,
the
law
then
changed
and
the
seaman's
right
were
expanded
in
many
particulars.
as
this
court
well
knows,
the
jones
act
adopts
the
provisions
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
modifying
the
common-law
rights
of
railway
employees
and
that
we
commonly
think
of
those
laws
as
being
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
now,
the
jones
act
has
in
it
some
substantive
rights
certainly
and
it
adopts
a
statute
which
has
any
other
substantive
rights.
it
is
long
been
held
that
the
statutory
period
prescribed
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
is
substantive
rather
than
procedural
since
it
comes
within
the
rule
that
it
is
a
portion
of
the
statute
creating
the
right.
now,
section
56
of
chapter
45
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
modifies
the
common-law
by
prescribing
a
period
of
limitation
within
which
the
action
provided
in
that
law
could
be
brought.
the
reach
and
scope
of
section
56
is
limited
to
actions
brought
under
this
chapter.
section
52
of
that
chapter
describes
the
actions
which
maybe
brought
under
that
charges
and
section
52
relates
to
causes
of
actions
by
employees
or
survivors
against
the
employers
or
injuries
resulting
--
injuries
or
death
resulting
in
whole
or
in
part
from
negligence.
now,
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
jones
act,
this
court
have
before
it
the
case
of
engel
against
davenport
and
in
that
case
the
question
was
whether
the
prescriptive
period
provided
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
at
that
time,
two
years,
controlled
over
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
state
of
california
which
at
that
time
was
a
one
year
statute.
the
court
recognized
the
problem
which
we
have
here
today.
it
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
issue
because
the
plaintiff
there
had
declared
upon
a
cause
of
action
based
upon
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
as
a
result
of
negligence,
so
the
court
permitted
the
action
within
the
longer
period
of
time.
the
next
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
which
most
merely
approaches
our
problem
is
the
case
of
mcgee
versus
the
united
states
in
165
f.2d.
there,
the
second
circuit
discussed
the
holding
in
engel
against
davenport
and
interpreted
that
holding
to
mean
that
if
the
plaintiff
declared
upon
a
cause
of
action
based
upon
negligence
--
negligence
on
seaworthiness
then
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
make
that
proof
in
order
to
avail
himself
of
a
longer
period
of
limitation
as
prescribed
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
now,
i
believed
the
law
to
be
that
when
a
summary
--
that
when
a
seaman,
asserts
an
action
for
unseaworthiness
in
a
state
court.
he
must
bring
his
action
within
the
state
prescribed
period
if
it
is
factually
based
upon
unseaworthiness,
simplicity
around
seaworthiness
which
exist
as
a
condition
not
arising
from
negligence
but
that
he
may
bring
it
within
the
period
of
the
jones
act
as
a
connection
arising
under
the
jones
act
if
the
same
condition
is
based
upon
some
negligence
of
the
ship
or
its
owner.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
sir
--
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
if
these
facts
do
not
sustain
his
negligent
count
then
he
does
have
that
--
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
yes
--
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
sir.
the
statute
of
limitations
which
would
apply
to
the
same
type
of
action
brought
in
the
law
side
on
--
as
an
action
at
law
in
the
federal
district
court
and
with
trial
by
jury
and
so
on
under
the
election
which
the
--
the
seaman
employee
had
would
be
governed
i
think
under
the
same
rules
because
of
the
rules
of
the
decision
act
insofar
as
it
would
apply
to
the
federal
court
sitting
in
that
state.
of
course,
then
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court,
you
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
now,
it
is
our
position
here
that
since
the
jury
facts
have
become
the
facts
before
this
court
and
particularly
those
with
reference
to
negligence
which
were
not
made
the
point
of
objection
on
appeal
at
all.
in
other
words,
the
counsel
did
not
raise
in
the
court
below
and
does
not
raise
here
any
points
of
appeal
relating
to
the
cause
of
action
which
he
asserted
based
upon
negligence.
and
since
the
jury
exonerated
the
respondent
here
from
all
acts
of
negligence
then
we
must
treat
this
case
as
if
it
were
a
case
based
only
upon
unseaworthiness
simplicity
or
unseaworthiness
which
existed
of
the
type
that
existed
prior
to
the
basis
to
the
jones
act.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
not
of
the
negligence.
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
i
believe
that
--
that
certainly
is
my
position,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
to
be
counsel's
position.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
do
not
think
so
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned.
i
--
i
believe
that
the
--
the
election
there
is
as
--
the
remedy
for
the
seaman
to
proceed
at
law
with
trial
by
jury
rather
than
the
election
of
remedies
between
the
unseaworthiness
and
--
and
negligent
counts.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that.
i
--
i
believe
that
his
election
is
simply
between
whether
he
proceeds
in
the
court
at
law
and
obtains
the
jury
trial
wherein
he
may
incorporate
all
of
this
counts
based
upon
the
same
facts
and
secure
in
them
that
they
either
by
reason
of
fault
or
by
reason
of
unseaworthiness
if
his
proof
is
--
is
--
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
--
such
as
distinct.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
well,
that
i
--
i
don't
quite
know
that
i
understand
the
court's
question
but
if
--
if
i
--
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
that
--
that
is
the
question
which
the
courts
below
have
had
some
difficulty
in
determining
and
--
and
the
most
recent
way
to
authority
i
think
is
that
the
election
is
only
as
to
whether
he
proceeds
before
a
jury
or
proceeds
admiralty.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
i
--
i
suggested
that
it's
substantive
in
the
jones
act
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
texas
act
which
was
applied
by
the
court
below
is
procedure
and
it
is
so
been
held.
it
is
a
general
statute
of
limitations
not
a
portion
of
the
statute
creating
the
right.
to
me,
the
--
the
right
of
the
texas
court
to
apply
its
own
statute
generally
in
this
type
of
case
is
no
different
from
committing
it
to
prescribe
the
jurisdiction
of
its
courts
or
the
prerequisite
steps
to
preserve
appellate
point
--
points
or
the
rules
of
civil
procedures.
the
only
other
point
that
i
wish
to
make
is
that
the
court
below
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
any
of
the
assignments
of
error
or
counter
assignments
of
error
--
or
it
had
an
opportunity
but
it
did
not
see
fit
to
pass
upon
them
and
if
the
court
does
see
fit
to
reverse
the
court
below,
i
believe
that
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case
would
be
to
remand
it
for
a
further
consideration
so
that
it
may
consider
all
of
the
points
which
were
briefed
at
the
submission
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
originally
thought
that
i
had
a
very
good
point
of
law
that
the
amendment
to
the
fela,
the
1939
amendment
of
the
fela
could
not
be
attributed
to
apply
it
to
the
jones
act
and
just
about
the
time
that
we
argued
or
we're
arguing
our
motions
below
this
court
rendered
its
opinion
in
the
cox
versus
roth
case
and
my
confidence
in
that
point
materially
decreased
and
so
i
--
i
have
abandoned
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
--
is
actually
here
now
insofar
as
the
initial
act
is
concerned,
of
course
the
background
there
goes
back
to
the
--
on
the
condition
that
existed
but
the
efforts
to
pass
a
--
a
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
and
to
apply
rights
to
these
classes
of
people,
federal
rights,
if
you
please
that
did
not
apply
the
other
classes
of
employees
generally.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
well,
this
court
has
have
before
its
famous
cases
which
could
not
have
reached
here
had
counsels
contention
been
correct
for
example
in
the
mahnich
versus
southern
steamship
company
case,
that
was
a
case
which
was
admittedly
filed
after
the
prescriptive
period
in
the
jones
act
through
it
was
filed
in
evidently
and
the
--
the
six-year,
i
believe
it
was
the
six-year
statute
which
was
applied
in
the
state
in
which
the
court
set
and
this
court
in
its
action
sent
back
for
trial
on
the
issues
of
the
situation
there.
that
case
would
not
have
been
alive
so
to
speak
had
the
--
the
court
and
should
the
court
apply
counsels
contentions
that
the
jones
act
embodies
the
whole
of
the
maritime
law
in
support
it
relates
to
seaman
injuries.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
i
--
i
do
not
either,
sir.
now
the
state
--
the
state
of
new
york
applies
its
six-year
statute
of
limitations
to
unseaworthy
claims
brought
in
those
courts.
this
contention
would
--
by
counsel
result
and
those
actions
being
terminated
for
three
years.
they
arrived
i
believe
then
under
a
theory
of
a
breach
of
warranty
which
they
attribute
to
their
contractual
provision
in
their
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that.
actually
the
lawyers
in
texas
are
more
familiar
with
the
texas
laws
than
they
are
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
if
the
courts
of
texas
or
the
statutes
of
texas
apply
uniformly
to
all
litigants
in
those
courts
except
insofar
as
the
expressed
provisions
of
the
jones
act
--
the
jones
act,
the
three-year
statute
does
definitely
apply
and
i'll
make
no
contention
and
it
does
not.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
bolton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
have
to
know
that.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
believe
that's
all.
thank
you.
