justice

frankfurter
could
we
--
could
we
decide
what
you
call
the
second
question
without
reading
the
whole
record
in
order
to
find
the
relevance
of
the
--
is
this
an
abstract
question
that
you're
tendering
or
does
it
relate
to
the
facts
made
out
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
something
about
the
bearing
of
the
jury
must
it
so
understood
it,
didn't
you
say
something
in
the
bearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
appearing
from
the
record
without
going
through
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
problem
is,
what
it
is
that
congress
said
when
it's
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
inferring
and
assuming
or
inferring
that
you
would
be
--
you
would
have
the
cause
of
action
which
you
here
urged
prior
to
the
jones
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
although
--
and
what
are
the
statute
of
limitation
prior
to
the
jones
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
controlling
statute
of
limitation
in
this
litigation
prior
to
the
jones
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
years,
why
--
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
right
was
a
--
the
substantive
right
was
uniformed
throughout
the
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
unseaworthiness
was
that
general
question
of
national
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
enforceability
depended
upon
the
state
law
prior
to
jones
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
statutory
limitation
was
the
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
the
jones
act
was
passed
not
taking
any
change
in
the
maritime
law,
but
having
a
provision
regarding
the
statute
of
limitation
in
the
same
act
that
change
the
law
regarding
unseaworthiness,
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
what
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
not
in
dispute
between
you
as
i
understood
mr.
mandell.
that
is
not
in
dispute
between
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it's
not
in
dispute
that
the
case
that's
now
before
us
is
as
though
he
had
laid
merely
unseaworthiness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
fact
that
you
joined
the
two
and
the
other
one
as
you
say
the
defendant
has
exonerated,
it
doesn't
change
the
nature
of
the
legal
problem
now
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask,
i
heard
nothing
about
any
light
shed
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
jones
act.
i
gather
there
isn't
any
as
the
counsel
would've
produced
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
on
--
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
there's
no
light
as
to
--
secondly,
i
gather
not
--
secondly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
is
a
bit
surprising
that
there
should
be
seemingly
as
little
light
on
the
substance
--
on
the
actual
determination
whether
the
jones
act
does
or
doesn't
apply
where
an
action
is
brought
merely
for
unseaworthiness
or
that's
the
only
claim
that
is
sustained.
here,
the
statutes
been
enforced
since
--
for
38
years.
one
counsel
is
surprised
that
law
isn't
--
everything
else
about
life
but
is
unexpected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
you
might
have
to
meet
the
argument
if
the
jones
act
sets
the
minimum
but
if
a
state
wants
to
give
more,
that
doesn't
contradict
the
jones
act.
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
much
of
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
it
--
if
the
mode
of
enforcement
because
the
locality
of
the
injury
is
local,
is
left
to
local
law,
that's
not
the
difficult
--
anyhow,
new
york
had
can
work
that
out
if
it
wants
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
texas
lawyers
have
to
be
familiar
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
independent
republic
of
texas
even
have
to
take
account
of
that
national
law
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mandell,
you
stated
with
great
candor
that
prior
to
the
jones
act,
the
local
law
of
limitation
where
it's
decide
by
congress
to
be
applied
to
suits
in
state
courts
and
also
the
federal
court
to
suit
in
any
court
state
or
federal
giving
a
maritime
right
for
unseaworthiness,
if
you're
in
maintenance
et
cetera
or
subject
to
the
local
law
of
limitation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
wrong
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i
accept
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
correction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
cause
act
and
not
act,
if
congress
doesn't
act
in
an
area
in
which
it
doesn't
give
a
statute
of
limitation
then
that's
the
policy
of
congress
that
the
local
law
should
apply
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
congress
has
chosen
not
to
leave
the
local
law
to
be
applicable
to
transactions
that
transpire
local.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
policy,
isn't
it
from
the
beginning
of
our
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
want
to
take
your
time
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
talking
about
words.
the
fact
is
that
if
congress
doesn't
pass
the
statute
of
limitation,
the
local
statute
applies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
the
right
derives
from
federal
constitution
on
those
law.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
now
knowing
the
history
of
the
jones
act,
i
think
i
can
say
both
you
and
i
know
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
indicate
--
will
you
state,
you
tell
me
whether
there
--
tell
the
court
whether
there
is
the
slightest
intimation
in
the
course
of
that
history
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
enforceable
rights
for
--
of
maritime
law
regarding
unseaworthiness
when
it
passed
the
jones
act
or
rather
whether
it
was
concerned
to
undo
what
i
believe
to
be
the
undesirable
cause
of
decisions
in
this
court
and
give
recovery
under
the
jones
act
not
only
different
substantive
rights
but
also
the
right
of
recovery
to
those
who
is
--
who--
in
cases
of
death.
is
there
any
indication
that
anybody
was
concerned
with
changing
the
then
maritime
law
about
unseaworthiness
except
to
create
a
new
substantive
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
big
except.
i
mean
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
that
you
find
in
anybody's
utterance
that
was
concerned
with
changing
the
then
existing
law
regarding
unseaworthiness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
read
that
as
whether
you
can,
but
apart
from
that,
is
there
anything
in
how
the
language
of
the
statute
does
that
i
cannot
see
for
the
light
of
it.
