did
i
hear
you
say,
mr.
mccracken,
that
the
premium
on
the
annuity
wasn't
reduced
because
of
the
insurance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there's
no
--
there
has
been
no
insurance
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
interest
of
the
beneficiary
--
the
interest
of
the
beneficiary
in
le
gierse
did
not
arrive,
did
not
come
into
being
until
that
the
testator
is
dead,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
here,
is
that
true
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
she
--
could
she
affect
the
interest
of
the
beneficiaries
and
the
policy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
opposite
was
the
fact
in
le
gierse,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
reaching
that.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
different
facts
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
interrupt
you
to
state
it
exactly
what
it
is
the
government
is
seeking
to
tax
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
--
you're
trying
to
tax
--
would
you
please
correct
the
inaccuracy
of
what
i'm
about
to
say,
you're
trying
to
tax
an
interest
which
came
into
being
not
at
all
in
contemplation
of
death
long
before
death
but
of
subsisting
living
interest
with
dollars
and
cents
which
were
wholly
unaffected
by
the
death
of
the
testator,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whatever
they
are,
the
variation
is
wholly
independent
of
the
creator
of
the
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
none
of
that
--
none
of
those
interest
would
have
been
taxable
except
to
the
beneficiaries
themselves,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
every
--
all
the
money
value
of
the
interest
that
this
woman
created
was
there
after
tax
--
an
interest
as
much
in
the
complete
dominion
of
those
beneficiaries
as
a
book
that
you
may
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
won't
they
tax
as
interest
in
contemplation
of
death?
i
could
understand
that,
i
mean
i
could
understand
that
argument
much
more
earlier
than
in
this
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
as
you
rightly
indicated
a
minute
ago,
the
size
of
what
they
were
getting
was
contingent
absolutely
and
was
created
to
be
contingent
upon
her
death.
so
i
could
understand
an
argument
that
this
was
in
contemplation
of
death.
why
--
why
--
why
didn't
the
court
--
the
government
take
that
route?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
could
interpret
that
i
think
with
as
much
justice
that
she
had
an
incident
of
ownerships
since
the
quality
of
the
ownership
was
dependent
upon
her
death
and
she
so
created
it
that
the
fulfillment
of
what
she
was
going
to
do
was
all
through
her
actions
and
was
dependent
upon
the
continuity
of
her
life.
she
didn't
--
ownership
in
the
ordinary
sense
had
an
estate
in
it
as
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
--
your
whole
argument
is
that
there
was
a
nexus
between
her
--
between
her
death
and
the
enjoyment
as
to
which
these
people
came,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
might
be
wrong
all
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
be
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
nothing
as
a
matter
of
law
that
would
have
prevented
one
of
the
eager
beneficiaries
who'd
lost
a
lot
of
money
and
who
needed
cash
getting
even
blasted,
getting
$50,000,
let
us
say
less,
wouldn't
it,
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
suppose
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
sometimes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sometimes
people
take
less
cash
because
they're
under
pressure
or
whatnot
or
the
spare
of
the
old
lady
living,
people
live
and
come
down
to
a
hundred.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
legal
transaction
in
this
case
must
be
judged
as
to
what
took
place
rather
than
the
legal
consequences
when
the
--
when
the
transactions
were
consummated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there,
the
substance
was
different
because
the
--
the
decedent
held
on.
that's
certainly
a
great
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
she
put
no
string
on
it?
