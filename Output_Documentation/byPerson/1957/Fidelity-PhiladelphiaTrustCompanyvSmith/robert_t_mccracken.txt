mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
if
the
court
please.
this
case
comes
here
from
--
on
certiorari
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
which
reversed
the
district
court,
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
and
it
brings
before
the
court
a
question
which
has
been
before
several
courts
of
appeals,
and
undoubtedly
that's
the
reason
that
this
court
granted
certiorari,
they
have
not
all
agreed
upon
the
inclusion
of
an
insurance
policy
in
a
testator's
estate.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these,
this
old
lady,
mrs.
robert
haines,
a
resident
of
philadelphia
at
the
age
of
--
in
somewhere
in
the
70s,
in
1934
was
persuaded
to
make
an
investment
or
rather
three
investments
totalling
$350,000
in
the
face
value
of
insurance.
the
beneficiaries
of
which
were
her
four
children.
at
her
age,
she
could
not
have
obtained
this
policy
without
a
medical
examination,
had
she
not
taken
out
at
the
same
time
annuities
from
the
same
companies
which
issued
the
insurance
policies
payable
to
her
and
non-refundable
at
her
death.
the
mathematics
of
the
transaction
were
such
as
carefully
worked
out
for
the
insurance
company
that
the
company
couldn't
lose.
she
paid
not
quite
the
face
value
of
the
policy
for
the
policy
but
a
considerable
sum
for
the
annuity
which
added
to
the
premium
that
she
had
for
the
policy,
exceeded
the
face
value
of
the
policy
by
a
substantial
amount.
a
similar
case
came
before
this
court
some
17
years
ago,
1941,
called
helvering
against
le
gierse,
and
in
that
case,
the
sole
question
presented
was,
was
this
insurance
of
such
a
nature
that
it
could
be
deducted
to
the
extent
of
$40,000
from
--
there's
a
taxable
state.
your
honors,
will
recall
that
up
to
a
certain
time,
the
insurance
made
out
to
beneficiaries
other
than
the
estate
was
deductible
up
to
the
extent
of
$40,000.
this
court
--
that
was
the
only
question
presented
in
that
case
so
stated.
this
court
decided
that
it
was
not
insurance
and
your
honors
so
decided
because
you
said
there
was
no
risk
for
the
very
reason
that
i
have
just
stated,
the
company
saw
to
it
that
it
got
enough
money
that
the
time
that
these
two
premiums
were
paid,
so
that
no
matter
what
happens,
whether
this
woman
died
the
day
after
she
took
out
the
policy
and
they
paid
the
face
value
of
the
policy
which
was
more
than
the
face
value
of
the
premium
on
the
policy
but
considerably
less
than
the
agreed
regular
premiums
or
whether
she
lived
for
20
years.
and
the
surrender
value,
the
cruel
value
grew
all
the
time
on
the
policy.
the
company
just
couldn't
lose
and
that
additional
amount
which
ran
above
the
face
value
of
the
policy
was
of
course
to
take
care
of
the
so-called
loaning
charges,
the
agent's
commission,
the
expenses
of
the
--
of
the
underwriting
and
the
profit
of
the
company.
now
that's
what,
your
honors,
decided
in
that
case
and
that's
all
that
was
decided
and
so
stated.
other
cases
have
since
arisen
including
this
one
in
which
what
you
said
there
has
been
taken
and
reached
out
to
control
a
situation
that
was
not
before
you
then.
what
you
said
there
was
this
is
not
insurance,
it
is
a
form
of
investment
using
the
insurance
policy
as
a
medium
of
investment
and
as
such
form
of
investment,
it
is
subject
only
to
the
risks
that
the
ordinary
investment
is.
every
case
has
been
decided
since
has
repeated
that
statement
and
has
stated
it
to
be
the
law
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it
being
the
law
that
this
is
not
insurance,
yet
anything
but
nomenclature.
his
insurance
went
out
of
the
case
of
these
series
of
cases
when,
your
honors,
decided
the
le
gierse
case.
now,
let
us
take
that
position
totally
and
i'll
go
on,
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
this
old
lady,
as
soon
as
she
took
out
the
insurance
policies,
assigned
them
towards
her
four
children,
absolutely,
irrevocably
and
they
were
--
they
took
possession.
and
that
time
on,
they
received
the
dividends
of
the
policy
which
are
not
large
as
your
honors
know
but
there
are
dividends
paid
on
policies.
they
also
enjoyed
the
annual
accretion
of
value
in
the
--
the
surrender
value
which
is
made
up
in
part
of
dividends.
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
that.
she
couldn't
have
touched
the
policies.
they
could've
taken
those
policies
out
in
any
year
up
to
the
time
of
her
death
and
surrendered
them,
and
gotten
the
surrender
value,
and
invested
it,
and
according
to
a
recent
case
which
the
tax
court
has
decided
from
which
no
appeal
was
taken
and
which
that
exactly
happened,
the
tax
court
said,
why
of
course
this
isn't
taxable,
there's
nothing
to
tax.
these
people
have
--
have
converted
this
asset
and
there's
nothing
to
tax.
they
may
have
spent
it
to
any
event.
that
was
the
reasoning
of
the
tax
court.
now
she
could
have
--
they
could
have
done
that
but
they
didn't
do
it.
they
left
the
policies
there
until
her
death.
i
represented
the
executors.
i
represented
her
for
many
years
and
i
wish
i'd
represent
too
and
they
brought
these
policies
to
her,
i
wouldn't
have
let
her
sign
them
because
i
don't
like
this
kind
of
an
investment,
i
would
have
demonstrated
to,
your
honors
in
a
few
moments
that
it
is
not
a
wise
investment.
but
we
--
i
advised
the
executors
not
to
include
this
in
the
tax
return,
the
state
tax.
they
did
not.
the
commissioner
assessed
the
deficiency
of
i
think
it's
a
$106,000
and
we
paid
the
tax
and
brought
suit
for
the
--
for
the
refund.
the
district
court
decided
in
our
favor.
the
court
of
appeals
following
a
decision
of
the
second
court
--
second
circuit
that
decided
against
us
and
we're
here
on
this
conflict
of
courts
below.
now,
let
us
take
the
position,
may
i
please
the
court,
which
of
course
we
must
take
that
this
is
not
in
any
sense
an
insurance
question.
your
honors,
took
that
out
of
the
case
in
1941
and
it's
never
been
there
since.
that
this
is
a
question
in
which
an
insurance
company
was
used
as
a
medium
or
machinery
of
investment,
that's
all
it
is.
now,
let
me
just
give
your
honors
one
or
two
analogies
which
occurred
to
me,
always
remembering
that
we're
talking
about
investments.
let
us
suppose
that
this
old
lady
had
gone
to
a
trust
wanting
to
give
this
$350,000
to
her
children
irrevocably
and
frankly
wanting
to
get
it
out
of
her
estate,
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
includable
in
the
--
in
the
tax
which
is
a
very
usual
and
common
thing
to
do,
it
is
not
evasion,
it's
following
the
rules,
she
had
12
years
so
there
was
no
question
to
that.
and
i
may
say
that
there's
no
question
here
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
contemplation
of
death
or
something
to
take
effect
of
death.
the
government
puts
--
bases
its
claim
entirely
on
the
section
of
the
act
that
says
that
she
retain
the
income.
she
retained
an
income
and
interest
in
the
--
in
the
property,
in
the
policy.
now,
let
us
suppose,
of
course
she
didn't,
i'll
explain
that
to
your
honors,
she
didn't
declare
at
all
in
this
policy,
all
that
she
had
retained
was
the
annuity
which
she
bought
at
the
same
time
and
which
she
could
have
bought
at
the
same
price
without
the
policy.
no
question
about
that,
that's
in
the
record.
now,
let
us
suppose
she'd
come
to
me
and
said,
"i
want
to
supply
$350,000
for
my
children.
i
want
to
do
it
now
while
i'm
alive."
and
suppose
i
had
said
to
her
and
she
had
accepted
the
advise,
go
to
a
trust
company
and
set
up
a
trust
for
the
benefit
of
your
children
for
life
or
for
your
life,
the
income
to
be
paid
to
them
for
your
life
but
giving
them
the
power
if
you
please,
by
unanimous
memorial
to
the
trustee
to
terminate
the
trust
at
any
time
and
get
the
money
which
is
equivalent
to
the
surrender
value
of
the
insurance
company.
and
then
i
have
said,
she
accepted
the
trust
company.
well,
i
want
them
to
take
this
there
myself
too
and
here
is
some
more
money
and
i'd
like
to
buy
or
set
up
a
trust
for
myself
for
life,
all
the
income
to
come
to
me
and
on
my
death
to
go
to
my
children.
now,
i
take
it,
your
honors
that
of
course
the
second
of
those
trusts
would
be
taxable.
she
retains
the
income,
nobody
disproves
that.
but
i
take
it,
your
honors,
that
in
that
set
of
circumstances,
even
the
government
would
not
have
tried
to
tax
the
first
of
those
two
trusts
and
i
say
that
with
assurance
because
i
tried
exactly
such
a
case,
a
number
of
years
ago
in
which
a
woman
who
had
been
--
who
curiously
enough
also
had
four
children
and
this
lady
have
been
giving
each
of
her
children
their
allowance
for
about
$5000
to
$6000
a
year
and
she
got
all
the
time
to
pay
the
taxes
on
her
own
income
in
the
high
brackets
because
it
cost
her
$12,000
to
$15,000
a
piece
to
pay
those
children
this
$5000.
and
somebody
advised
her,
why
don't
you
set
up
a
trust
for
them
and
let
them
pay
the
tax
on
their
own
income
from
the
trust
and
that's
exactly
what
she
did,
set
up
the
irrevocable
trust.
they
began
to
get
the
income,
pay
the
taxes
on
it,
she
lived
seven
or
eight
years,
or
nine
years,
i
forgotten
which
and
died.
and
they
attempted
--
the
government
attempted
to
tax
that
--
include
that
in
the
estate.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
yes,
yes.
the
government
have
to
do
that.
they
of
course
couldn't
do
it
on
this
section
of
the
act
because
she
didn't
retain
the
income.
here,
they're
doing
it
only
on
the
retention
of
income,
alleged
detention
of
income.
they
did
it
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
gift
and
contemplation
death.
well,
i
tried
that
case
before
the
tax
court.
i
asked
your
honors,
pardon
me,
a
personal
illusion
but
it's
exactly
this
situation.
i
tried
that
case
before
the
tax
court
and
i
was
able
to
persuade
the
tax
court,
not
that
it
was
--
that
there
were
--
that
it
was
not
delivered
in
contemplation
of
death
but
it
was
delivered
in
contemplation
of
continued
life
that
she
got,
she
wanted
to
lessen
her
income
tax
payments
and
still
give
this
--
her
children
a
needful
amount
of
money
to
live
on
and
the
tax
court
decided
in
my
favor
and
the
government
threw
up
its
hands
never
even
appealed.
now,
therefore,
i
say
with
some
assurance
that
in
the
analogy
that
i
just
attempted
to
give
to
your
honors,
if
she
had
set
up
this
trust
fund,
these
two
funds
with
the
same
trust
company,
on
the
same
day
through
a
one
check
for
the
--
if
you
please
for
the
total
amount
of
money
with
the
both
of
them
or
deposit
to
secure
it.
if
she
set
those
up,
of
course
the
second
of
the
trust
funds
in
which
she
retained
the
income
would
have
been
taxable
and
of
course
the
first
would
not.
now,
i
say
that
there
isn't
an
iota
of
difference
between
that
first
type
of
fund
and
this
insurance
policy
which
was
irrevocably
assigned
to
the
children
and
which
the
children
could
have
taken
out
any
day
at
all
and
surrender
it
for
less
than
its
face
value
but
for
a
very
substantial
part
of
its
face
value
and
just
before
her
death
for
almost
its
exact
face
value.
it
was
their
property.
yes,
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
yes,
sir
and
they
--
they
possessed
the
policies
and
they
got
the
income
from
it.
the
dividends
were
paid
to
them
by
the
company
and
the
company
recognized
it
and
uses
an
irrevocable
assignment
and
they
collected
the
insurance.
we
didn't
collect
insurance.
the
--
the
executors
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
insurance.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
oh,
yes,
gift
tax
were
paid.
oh,
yes,
yes.
i
think
she
was
entirely
comfortable
in
her
mind
that
the
whole
thing
have
been
handled
that
way.
now,
the
government
will
come
back
and
say
this,
all
they
may
say
but
the
trouble
is
that
this
woman
couldn't
get
the
policy
of
insurance
without
taking
out
the
annuity,
therefore
it
was
bound
to
be
one
investment.
now,
let
me
just
stretch
my
analogy
a
little
further.
let
us
suppose
in
going
to
this
trust
company,
she
had
attempted
to
set
up
a
small
trust
first
for
her
children
and
in
my
experience,
trustees
won't
always
take
small
trusts.
they
will
say
to
you,
no,
this
--
this
--
this
doesn't
pay.
we
won't
take
a
trust
of
$10,000
or
$5000
or
whatnot.
they
--
they
have
refused
and
then
she
had
said,
"will
you
take
it
if
i
take
out
a
trust
there
--
put
out
--
create
a
trust
of
a
half
million
dollars
for
myself?"
and
they
will
of
course
would've
said
yes.
now,
they
would
--
there
would
have
been
one
transaction
in
which
she
could
not
have
gotten
the
first
without
supplying
the
second,
just
as
she
can
--
couldn't
get
the
first
here
without
supplying
the
annuity
although
she
could
get
the
annuity
without
taking
out
the
policy.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
no,
sir.
the
pre
--
the
record
shows
that
the
premium
on
the
annuity
was
exactly
what
she
or
anybody
else
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
of
her
age
and
the
premium
on
the
policy
was
exactly
what
she
or
anybody
else
would
have
paid
for
that
policy,
had
she
taken
a
medical
examination
and
passed
it.
the
premiums
were
calculated
on
the
actuaries
or
rate
just
exactly
as
if
this
curious
crossing
transaction.
that's
all
the
record
and
that's
it
with
it.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
one
transaction,
although
it
took
place
on
the
same
day
but
we
have
two
transactions
just
as
i've
tried
to
point
out
to,
your
honors,
with
respect
to
the
trust
--
trust
company.
we
have
two
transactions,
one
for
the
children,
the
insurance
policy
and
the
other
for
herself,
the
annuity.
all
she
ever
got
after
she
paid
that
money
or
all
she
ever
could
get
was
what
the
annuity
gave
her.
all
of
the
children
got
or
ever
could
get
was
what
the
life
insurance
policy
gave
them.
she
couldn't
touch
that.
they
couldn't
touch
the
annuity.
the
moment
she
walked
out
of
that
place
assigning
the
policies
to
these
children
irrevocably,
the
whole
thing
was
split
wide
open
with
two
winners,
absolute
winners,
one
on
each
side.
now,
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
--
there
was
--
the
section
upon
which
they
base
this,
namely
that
she
retained
the
income
for
life
on
that
insurance
policy,
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
that
can
prevail.
if
the
government
--
if
she
lived
12
years,
i
may
say
she's
an
extremely
vigorous
old
lady,
she
was
a
director
of
a
large
steel
company
and
attended
all
the
director's
meetings
up
to
about
a
year
of
her
death.
she
lived
12
years
after
this.
there's
no
question
that
government
doesn't
suggest
that
this
was
in
contemplation
of
death
or
anything
of
that
kind.
so
that's
out
of
the
case
or
something
to
take
effect
to
the
death,
that's
all
out
of
the
case.
there's
nothing
in
this
case
if
you
--
even
look
at
the
government's
brief,
their
citation
of
the
--
of
the
statute
under
which
it
acts
is
the
retention
of
income
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
there
were
really
three
policies.
the
insurance
--
there
was
a
very
clever
salesman
that
(inaudible)
this
woman,
he
first
sold
her
a
$200,000
policy
in
the
mutual
life
of
new
york
and
then
he
sold
her
a
$100,000
policy
a
day
or
two
later
in
the
same
company.
and
then
he
showed
her
the
$50,000
to
john
hancock
life
insurance
company.
that
policy
differs
in
a
slight
degree
because
there
the
assignment
was
not
to
the
children
direct
or
to
a
trustee,
the
fidelity-philadelphia
for
the
children
but
absolute
--
absolute
irrevocable
and
they
were
just
to
get
(inaudible)
children
instead
of
giving
it
to
the
children
direct.
but
at
that
time,
she
thought
perhaps
she
gave
them
enough,
but
she
gave
them
the
300,
so
she
thought
she
better
put
something
in
trust
for
it.
but
it's
absolute
and
that
company
has
just
the
same
--
had
just
the
same
right
to
surrender
value
as
the
children
themselves.
now,
i
mentioned
just
the
word
and
i'm
merely
through
sir.
i
mentioned
the
cases,
the
fact
that
there
had
been
certain
cases.
there
is
a
conflict
to
the
cases.
the
--
there
was
one
other
case
that
came
here
before
your
honors,
the
goldstone
case
and
that
was
a
very
similar
case.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
a
case
called
united
states
against
goldstone.
it's
in
325
u.s.
it's
on
the
brief
sir.
there,
the
situation
was
different
in
this
respect.
it
wasn't
an
absolute
assignment
as
to
goldstone
reserve,
the
reserve
--
the
reversionary
right
in
the
policy
into
his
estate.
and
justice
murphy's
opinion
starts
out
by
saying
that
the
one
determining
factor
in
this
case
is
the
reservation
of
this
reversionary
right.
now,
that's
only
other
case
that's
been
before
your
honors,
except
--
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
sir?
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
that's
the
one
i
just
said.
the
--
the
one
case
has
been
out
of
my
side
is
the
bohnen
case,
decided
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
b-o-h-n-e-n,
bohnen,
bohnen.
and
it
came
here
and
was
decided
--
was
affirmed
on
a
four
to
four
court
holding,
mr.
justice
jackson
being
ill
at
the
time.
and
when
justice
jackson
took
the
seat
of
the
bench,
an
application
was
made
for
a
rehearing
and,
your
honors,
refused
the
rehearing.
now,
whether
that
refusal
means
anything
at
all
or
whether
it
means
that,
your
honors,
were
satisfied
with
the
decision,
i
don't
know
and
nobody
--
nobody
else
on
this
side
of
the
bar
does.
but
that's
the
only
other
case,
the
--
that
--
that's
the
only
chance
this
court
has
had
at
the
exact
question
that's
here.
the
bohnen
case
was
identical
with
this
case.
there
was
in
case
in
the
--
in
the
second
circuit
called
burr,
that
was
the
first
case
and
then
two
others
had
followed
it,
one
of
the
two
being
--
being
this
case
of
ours
and
they
were
just
following
the
burr
case.
our
contention
is
that
the
difficulty
with
those
cases
that
while
they
start
out
by
reciting,
your
honors
holding
that
there's
no
insurance
in
this
picture,
it's
a
pure
and
simple
investment.
when
they
get
down
to
the
decision,
they
start
to
talk
about
all
the
provisions
of
insurance
policies
and
they
drag
the
insurance
back
into
the
case
in
order
to
reach
and
they
got
to,
in
order
to
reach
the
decision
that
they
did
reach.
but
i
submit,
sir
that
you
can't
so
drag
it
in
to
take
this
out
of
the
field
of
investment
which
this
court
has
said
it
is
and
i've
tried
to
argue
this
case
honestly
on
the
theory
that
it's
an
investment
and
nothing
else.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
may
i
just
say
one
thing
if,
your
honors,
please.
mr.
robert
t.
mccracken
i
don't
think
i
used
quite
all
my
time
as
to
counsel's
analogy
of
the
single
trust
with
reservation
of
income
to
the
settler
remainder
to
the
children
being
this
exact
situation.
i
submit
that
it
could
not
be
the
situation
--
exact
situation
unless
in
the
trustee's
instrument
the
children
were
given
the
right
to
take
out
three
quarters
of
the
--
of
the
principal
of
the
trust
and
what
could
have
become
of
her
income
if
that
was
so.
the
statute
says
that
it's
only
taxable
if
she
retains
the
income
upon
that
part
which
is
attempted
to
be
included
and
she
didn't
retain
any
income
on
the
part
that
is
intended
to
be
included
in
this
case.
