chief

would
you
state
me
out
on
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
please.
i'd
like
to
know
what
difference
it
makes
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
whether
her
heirs
got
as
a
much
as
she
expected
that
they
would
get
out
of
this
insurance
policy
or
whether
they
got
less
provided
she
had
divested
herself
of
her
entire
interest
in
it.

i
--
that
--
that
isn't
clear
in
my
mind.
i
like
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
baum
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
supposed
--
suppose
that
they
did
turn
these
policies
in
and
take
the
face
value
before
she
died,
would
there
been
any
tax
due?
chief
justice
earl
warren
looking
through
form
to
substance,
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
substance
here
is
that
she
divested
herself,
all
of
her
right
and
interest
in
this
transaction,
in
this
--
in
this
fund
and
at
the
time
she
died,
she
was
possessed
with
none
of
it?
chief
justice

warren
mr.
mccracken.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
