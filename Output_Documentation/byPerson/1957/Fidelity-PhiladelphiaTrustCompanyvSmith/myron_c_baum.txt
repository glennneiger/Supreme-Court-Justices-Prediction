mr.
myron
c.
baum
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it
might
help
a
little
bit
if
we
talked
about
some
concrete
facts
here
in
terms
of
the
premiums
that
were
paid.
there
were
three
insurance
policies
and
three
contemporaneous
annuity
contracts.
i
think
it
would
be
easier
if
we
consider
that
as
one
insurance
policy
totalling
$350,000
and
an
annuity
which
yielded
$8000
and
some
odd
dollars
per
year.
there
is
no
substantial
difference
between
the
--
among
the
three
policies,
we
do
not
contest
the
--
any
question
as
to
the
revocability
of
the
assignments.
the
formula
for
issuing
these
contracts
was
that
the
combined
premiums
for
the
insurance
and
the
annuity
must
equal
eleven-tenths
of
the
face
value
of
the
insurance
policy.
this
decedent
pay
for
$350,000
worth
of
insurance,
$384,000
--
strictly
speaking
that
should
be
$385,000,
there's
a
discrepancy
of
$1000
in
one
of
the
policy
but
we
will
assume
since
it
makes
no
substantial
difference
that
it
was
eleven-tenths.
she
was
not
required
to
take
any
medical
examination
but
the
premium
for
the
insurance
policy
was
charged
at
the
regular
insurance
rates,
namely
the
same
rates
that
would
have
been
charged
had
she
been
found
medically
to
be
in
good
health.
that
premium
was
a
combined
total
of
$314,000.
the
balance
of
the
total
required,
namely
$384,000,
was
the
total
allocable
to
the
annuity
and
by
that
i
mean
as
the
district
court
found
that
she
did
not
have
any
choice
in
how
much
of
an
annuity
she
wanted.
she
had
to
purchase
an
annuity
which
cost
$70,000.
she
couldn't
say
i
want
an
annuity
that
would
yield
me
only
$5000
a
year.
the
transaction
worked
the
other
way.
it
worked
from
the
premium
end.
she
had
to
purchase
a
$70,000
premium
annuity,
whatever
the
yield
might
be
and
that
is
exactly
what
she
did.
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious
and
in
fact
it
is
stated
expressly
in
the
findings
below.
the
company
required
this
in
order
to
protect
itself
in
case
she
died
a
short
time
after
the
policy
issue.
if
that
should
happen,
the
company
would
always
have
in
hand
a
sum
sufficient
to
pay
the
insurance.
that
--
the
10%
extra
was
for
loaning
charges
and
commissions
as
counsel
state
but
even
after
that,
the
company
always
had
$350,000
in
its
possession
and
was
obligated
to
pay
this
annuity
of
$8000
which
comes
to
approximately
2.5%
on
the
investment.
that
leads
us
squarely
to
helvering
versus
le
gierse,
which
counsel
mentioned.
i
would
like
to
state
at
the
outset
that
this
court
in
helvering
versus
le
gierse
did
not
solely
decide
that
this
was
not
insurance.
at
the
last
page
of
mr.
justice
murphy's
opinion,
after
having
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
was
not
insurance,
he
states,
we
now
must
consider
whether
it
is
taxable
and
he
then
said
it
is
taxable
under
section
302
(c)
of
a
prior
revenue
act
which
is
the
predecessor
of
section
811
(c)
which
is
the
section
we
are
now
dealing
with
today.
so
this
court
in
le
gierse
said
that
this
transaction
was
taxable
under
the
very
same
section
we
are
presently
concerned.
but
it
went
much
further
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it
--
well
in
that
--
at
that
time
it
was
section
302.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it's
in
substance
the
same,
yes,
your
honor.
there
have
been
various
modifications
there
since.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
no,
sir.
the
only
difference
factually
between
this
case
and
le
gierse,
and
we
may
straighten
that
out
right
now,
is
that
in
le
gierse
the
decedent
still
owned
the
policies
at
her
death,
the
insurance
policy.
she
had
not
assigned.
that
question
was
--
was
manifested
throughout,
she
still
held
it.
i'm
not
saying
that
le
gierse
has
decided
this
case
but
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
what
it
did
decide.
it
did
decide
under
those
facts
without
an
assignment
that
this
transaction
was
taxable
and
in
doing
so
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
well,
it's
a
question
of
what
you
mean
by
their
interest.
they
have
an
interest
during
the
decedent's
lifetime,
here
they
have
the
privilege
of
surrendering
the
policy
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
in
this
case,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
no,
your
honor.
in
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
opposite
was
the
fact
in
le
gierse.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
i
think
i
--
i
will
come
to
why
i
think
that
is
not
a
difference.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that's
right.
in
le
gierse,
this
court
examined
it,
examined
this
transaction
and
said,
as
counsel
stated,
that
this
was
an
investment,
a
single
investment.
it
expressly
said
that
although
these
policies
are
separate
and
neither
refers
to
the
other
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
there
was
no
contract
with
the
insurance
company
which
reference
was
made
to
both.
they
were
handled
with
separate
application,
separate
premium
payments,
separate
all
the
way
through
and
so
was
it
in
le
gierse,
that
even
though
these
were
completely
separate
--
separate
and
as
mr.
justice
murphy
stated,
studiously
avoided
any
reference
to
each
other.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
they
represented
a
single
investment
because
the
policies
counteract
each
other.
why
do
they
counteract
each
other
is
a
very
simple
reason.
when
the
insurance
is
purchased
from
the
company's
point
of
view,
the
company
is
--
if
we
may
use
the
word
betting
that
the
insured
will
live
a
long
time.
when
it
issues
an
annuity
policy
it
is
betting
the
opposite.
it
is
betting
that
the
annuitant
will
live
a
short
time.
the
two
counterbalance.
if
the
court
is
interested
in
the
appendix
to
mr.
justice
--
to
judge
clark's
opinion
in
the
third
circuit
in
commissioner
versus
keller's
estate
which
was
later
affirmed
by
this
court.
he
has
set
forth
the
algebraic
computations
which
prove
that
the
discounted
sum
necessary
to
pay
the
face
value
of
the
insurance,
plus
the
discounted
sum
necessary
to
pay
the
annuity
always
--
always
equal
to
the
face
value
of
the
policy
or
as
he
puts
it
in
terms
of
a
$100.
he
has
set
that
forth
in
his
opinion
and
he
has
the
computation.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
government
is
seeking
to
tax
this
as
a
single
investment,
your
honor,
from
which
the
income
is
retained.
the
insurance
is
entirely
dependent
upon
the
annuity.
it
could
not
exist
without
the
annuity.
therefore,
the
whole
thing
must
be
taken
together
as
one
unit.
the
--
the
income
comes
from
the
entire
fund,
not
merely
from
the
annuity
portion.
it
comes
from
the
entire
fund
and
necessarily
so
because
otherwise
the
company
would
be
gambling
with
its
policy
holder's
money
in
attempting
to
issue
insurance
in
this
manner.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
an
interest
which
--
for
which
the
rights
of
the
beneficiaries
vary
from
time
to
time
in
substantial
respects.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
your
honor.
but
what
this
--
what
this
decedent
did
as
counsel
frankly
stated
was
he
wanted
to
transfer
$350,000
to
--
she
wanted
to
transfer
$350,000
to
her
children.
if
shecpo
did
not
do
so
outright
and
never
do
in
her
lifetime
were
those
children
entitled
to
$350,000.
if
they
had
surrendered
the
policy,
they
would
received
almost
at
all
times
not
only
less
than
the
face
value
but
less
than
the
premium
which
she
paid
for
the
policy
and
because
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
if
they
had
surrendered
it,
then
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
relationship.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
but
the
fact
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that
is
right,
your
honor.
with
this
exception,
the
fact
is
that
the
statute
says
that
it
taxes
income
which
is
retained
--
a
transfer
of
property
from
which
income
is
retained
for
any
period
which
does
not
in
fact
end
before
death.
the
fact
is
here,
your
honor,
that
the
assignees
of
the
policies
and
beneficiaries
at
the
same
time
did
not
surrender
these
policies.
they
fulfilled
to
manifest
intention
of
this
decedent
to
receive
the
$350,000.
the
only
way
they
could
do
that
was
not
to
exercise
their
rights
as
owners
of
the
policies.we
have
to
take,
i
think,
a
realistic
view
of
this
transaction.
if
they
had
exercised
their
rights
at
any
time,
there
would
have
been
a
severe
penalty
upon
them
financially.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
well,
an
interesting
point
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
contemplation
of
death
theory,
your
honor,
i
think
--
does,
your
honor,
mean
to
take
that
effect
in
possession
or
enjoyment
at
death?
mr.
myron
c.
baum
but
the
reason
we
could
not
take
that
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
subsection
of
section
811,
which
includes
those
says
that
such
a
transfer
is
taxable
only
if
the
decedent
held
incidence
of
ownership
at
the
time
of
her
death.
she
had
admittedly
no
incidence
of
ownership
in
this
insurance
policy.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
well
as,
your
honor,
said
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
if
we
had
argued
the
other
way,
then
your
honor
would
have
possibly
asked
me
where
are
the
incidents
of
ownership
which
she
held
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
--
and
i
would
had
to
say
none.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
we
might
be.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
fully
aware
of
that
and
the
previous
decision
of
this
court
clearly
so
indicates.
le
gierse
not
only
considered
the
facts
as
they
existed
where
the
policies
had
not
been
assigned
but
it
was
expressly
stated
in
le
gierse
that
no
matter
who
holds
these
two
contracts,
they
still
operate
to
counteract
each
other
and
this
is
so
because
the
insurance
company
could
not
have
undertaken
to
agree,
to
pay
$350,000
for
a
premium
of
$314,000
when
it
had
no
assurance
even
if
the
decedent
was
in
good
health.
the
bohnen
case
which
leads
to
the
conflict
here,
we
have
three
circuits
which
have
ruled
in
the
court
with
the
government's
view,
namely
the
second,
the
third
and
the
sixth.
but
the
seventh
circuit
in
bohnen
said
that
the
fact
that
the
two
contracts
were
issued
at
the
same
time
and
that
the
policy
could
have
not
been
obtained
without
the
annuities
of
no
legal
significance
and
that
seems
to
be
the
basis
of
its
holding.
yet
in
le
gierse,
this
court
fastened
upon
that
very
point
to
show
that
that
was
a
single
investment.
and
i
failed
to
see
how
this
case
differs
from
a
straight
trust
where
the
decedent
reserves
to
herself
the
income
for
life
and
hasn't
created
a
con
--
a
vested
remainder
in
her
children.
that
life
can
--
as
the
court
below
appropriately
noted,
has
no
rights,
or
title,
or
legal
interest
in
the
remainder
created
in
favor
of
the
children.
the
life
tenant
merely
has
the
income
but
the
two
are
still
interrelated
and
that
certainly
is
the
classic
example
of
the
retention
of
income
for
life
situation
which
this
court
has
held
taxable.
it
is
interesting
also
to
note
that
in
two
states
under
similar
statutes,
the
same
result
have
been
reached
similar
to
those
that
the
government
is
now
contending.
those
states
are
the
states
of
connecticut
and
new
jersey
where
similar
combination
policies
were
presented
to
the
court
and
a
question
of
a
state
taxation
at
both
courts
held
that
the
two
were
related,
that
this
was
a
transfer
with
the
retention
of
income.
i
might
say
also
in
reference
to
the
goldstone
case
that
in
goldstone,
counsel
correctly
noted
that
this
court
decided
the
case
upon
the
ground
that
the
decedent
had
retained
a
reversionary
interest
in
the
policy.
the
court
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
states
that
because
of
this
decision,
we
need
not
pass
upon
the
government's
alternative
contention,
that
this
is
taxable
as
a
transfer
with
income
retained
for
life.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
run
into
a
furious
situation
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
le
gierse.
it
is
not
taxable
as
insurance
because
this
court
has
said
in
le
gierse
that
these
combination
contracts
are
not
insurance
and
if
this
court
reverses
the
judgment
below,
it
is
not
taxable
in
any
other
fashion.
therefore,
we
have
a
perfect
device
for
avoidance
of
any
tax
with
a
--
by
a
bootstrap
of
lifting
up
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
le
gierse
which
was
originally
designed
to
prevent
the
taxpayer
from
taking
advantage
of
an
insurance
exemption.
now,
as
to
the
surrender
value,
i
would
like
to
add
one
word.
i
think
i
have
partially
covered
it
when
i
said
that
the
statute
is
directed
to
a
period
which
does
not
in
fact
end
before
death
and
in
fact
these
policies
were
never
surrendered.
in
addition
to
that,
however,
we
need
not
speculate
as
to
what
the
situation
would
be.
counsel
has
afforded
us
i
think
a
very
good
analogy
for
our
purposes
in
his
brief,
where
he
compares
the
situation
to
that
of
a
savings
bond
which
you
purchase
for
$900,
which
--
that
reaches
its
full
value
of
$1000
in
10
or
12
years.
and
he
says,
suppose
that
have
been
transferred
to
the
children,
the
children
can
cash
that
in
at
any
time.
but
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
in
that
case,
the
donor
has
given
only
$900
for
that
bond
and
the
donee
never
receives
less
than
$900.
here,
if
we
take
the
premium,
the
decedent
paid
$314,000
for
these
three
insurance
policies.
if
the
children
had
sought
to
cash
them
in
shortly
after
their
issuance,
they
would
have
received
$25,000
less
than
that
amount,
and
$61,000
less
than
the
face
value
of
the
policy.
and
even
in
1938,
they
would
have
received
$14,000
less
than
the
premium
and
$50,000
less
than
the
face
value.
the
cash
surrender
value
never
did
reach,
i
must
correct
counsel
on
that,
never
did
reach
the
face
value.
its
higher
figure
was
$326,000
which
was
still
$24,000
below
the
face
value
of
the
policy.
so
that
as
the
court
below
noted
and
has
quoted
from
the
new
jersey
decision
in
bank
of
new
york,
it
is
fantastic
to
assume
that
what
this
decedent
really
meant
to
do
was
an
out
and
out
transfer
of
this
insurance
policy
to
her
children
as
a
present
gift.
what
she
intended
and
what
everybody
to
the
transaction
obviously
understood
was
that
this
would
be
held
until
her
death
that
she
would
continue
to
enjoy
the
income.
and
as
the
court
noted
in
le
gierse,
and
coming
back
to
this
interrelation,
the
court
said
in
le
gierse
that
the
only
risk
the
insurance
company
assumes
is
an
investment
risk
that
the
funds
which
it
holds
will
not
earn
as
much
as
it
has
agreed
to
pay
to
the
annuity.
in
speaking
of
that,
the
court
was
referring
not
to
the
annuity
alone
but
to
the
entire
fund
held
at
its
disposal.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
difference
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'd
be
glad
to
try
and
clarify
it.
the
difference
is,
the
petitioner
asserts
this
is
an
out
and
out
gift.
n
fact
he
goes
so
far
as
to
say
it's
an
out
and
out
gift
of
the
cash
surrender
value.
this
court,
i
might
note,
has
held
in
guggenheim
versus
rasquin
that
the
cash
surrender
value
is
not
even
the
measure
of
the
value
of
this
type
of
policy.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
policy,
not
the
cash
surrender
value,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
the
policy
was
given
but
they
say
it
was
an
out
and
out
gift
of
the
cash
surrender
value
and
of
its
subsequent
accretions,
and
that
it
was
up
to
the
assignees
alone
to
decide
whether
it
should
continue
to
exist
or
not.
what
i
say
now,
the
reason
that
that
becomes
important
therefore,
your
honor,
is
that
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
it
was
never
intended
that
they
should
exercise
any
present
dominion
over
this
policy,
that
they
--
if
they
did,
it
would
have
cost
a
severe
penalty.
this
was
a
strange
way
to
make
a
gift,
where
you
--
you
transfer
to
your
donees
property
which
will
net
them
say
$50,000
less
than
what
you
had
put
into
it
at
the
same
time
with
no
investment
laws
involved
and
that
is
exactly
what
would
have
happened
here.
if
they
had
attempted
to
realize
on
their
--
on
--
on
this
policy
during
her
lifetime,
she
would
have
been
penalized
by
having
just
contributed
to
the
insurance
company,
the
difference
between
the
cash
surrender
value
and
the
face
value
of
this
policy.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it
would
have
taken
all
the
beneficiaries
but
certainly
not,
your
honor.
all
the
beneficiaries
would
have
had
to
act
together,
there
were
four.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
and
they
were
joint
beneficiaries.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
all
four
of
them
--
yes,
certainly
not.
there
was
nothing
as
a
matter
of
law
from
taking
the
cash
if
they
had
wished
to
do
so
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
and
i
make
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that
could
be
so,
your
honor.
but
as
this
court
said
in
goldstone,
we
must
look
at
the
facts
as
they
exist
at
the
time
of
death,
and
at
the
time
of
death
this
policy
had
not
been
surrendered,
and
whether
these
speculative
possibilities
might
have
arisen,
the
fact
is
that
they
did
not
arise.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
no,
i
was
referring,
your
honor,
to
the
language
about
which
does
not
in
fact
end
before
his
death
in
the
--
in
the
statute.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that
would
have
created
a
wholly
new
relationship,
your
honor,
and
i
think
if
i
may
express
my
opinion,
they
would
--
the
--
the
insurance
policy
is
gone,
the
--
the
beneficiaries
or
assignees
have
received
the
cash.
the
annuity
would
then
become
a
true
annuity
in
the
usual
sense,
namely,
an
annuity
which
has
of
this
--
as
its
objective
the
use
of
income
and
part
of
corpus,
and
possibly
speaking
there
would
have
been
no
tax.
i
say
possibly
for
this
reason,
the
commissioner
has
taken
the
position
in
one
case
as
counsel
noted
before
the
tax
court
that
this
made
no
difference.
the
tax
court
ruled
against
him.
that
case
was
not
appealed
and
we
don't
have
that
problem
here
since
the
surrender
was
not
made
here.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
yes,
sir.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
legally
proper,
there
is
no
doubt,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
she
did
it
and
what
she
did
was
legally
proper.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
that,
your
honor,
depends
on
where
the
income
is
paid
from
and
what
i've
tried
to
urge
upon,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
itself
held
in
le
gierse
and
quite
correctly
that
that
is
an
income
upon
the
whole
sum
invested,
namely,
the
amount
invested
in
the
insurance
and
in
the
--
and
in
the
annuity.
the
company
is
holding
that
combined
fund.
that's
how
it
is
enabled
to
be
whole
at
all
times
and
without
laws.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it
is
in
form,
your
honor,
but
as
this
court
said
in
le
gierse,
we
must
look
through
the
forms
of
the
substance
of
this
transaction
and
this
is
all
one.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
it
certainly
is
and
i
would
say
it
was
even
greater,
your
honor,
had
not
this
court
said
that
no
matter
who
held
the
policy
the
result
would
be
the
same
and
that
is
i
think
the
effect
of
your
language,
not
of
yours,
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
--
the
court
language
in
--
in
le
gierse.
that
--
mr.
myron
c.
baum
no,
your
honor.
i
must
respectfully
disagree.
i
would
say
that
the
substance
is
that
she
put
this
money
away,
as
if
she
had
put
it
in
a
bank
and
said
to
the
bank,
"pay
me
the
income
from
this
during
my
lifetime.
pay
my
beneficiaries
the
principal
at
my
death."
now,
i
--
in
fact
in
my
brief
i
thought
of
another
analogy
which
is
an
analogy
where
you
create
a
trust
with
a
life
income
to
yourself
and
a
remainder
to
your
children,
with
the
privilege
in
your
children
to
discount
the
remainder
in
advance
by
withdrawing
a
lesser
amount.
if
the
children
do
not
withdraw
that
amount
but
leave
it
there
until
death,
then
this
is
squarely
a
remainder
with
a
life
estate
which
is
the
classic
situation,
that
this
section
811
(c)
is
designed
to
tax.
i
failed
to
see
that
there's
any
substantial
difference
here
and
that
coming
again
to
your
honors
prior
question
is
that
what
this
transaction
--
and
that
was
why
i
was
talking
about
the
difference
in
value
that
this
shows
that
this
decedent
intended
that
this
money
stay
there
during
her
life
and
that
the
children
would
leave
it
there
during
her
life.
mr.
myron
c.
baum
she
put
no
legal
string
on
it.
no,
your
honor,
that
is
quite
true.
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
stated,
i
respectfully
submit
judgment
should
be
affirmed.thank
you.
