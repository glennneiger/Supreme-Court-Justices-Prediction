justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
this
--
when
did
this
problem,
under
this
general
statute,
first
began
to
show
the
difficulties
the
courts
have
found
it,
or
at
least
have
reached
results
that
you
now
seek
to
get
upset
in
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
have
been
a
district
court
decision,
how
do
they
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
do
they
begin
to
go
one
way
or
the
other?
what
i'm
getting
at
is
i'm
always
troubled.
the
department
takes
a
long
time
to
get
a
ruling
from
this
court
instead
of
getting
an
elucidation
of
ambiguity
on
the
hill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
--
not
in
the
lose
sense
of
the
term
but
it's
not
a
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
false
claims
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
a
very
different
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
this
statute
put
into
the
court,
1940?
when
did
--
i
ordered
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
didn't
get
into
the
code
until
when.
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
bothers
me,
and
seriously
bothers
me
mr.
doub,
is
why
when
you've
got
a
technical
statute
like
this,
and
by
technical
statute,
i
mean
no
more
than
that
not
general
loose
phrases
when
used,
but
specific
phrases,
namely,
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
office
that
thereon,
i
say
not
a
general
phrase,
the
government
of
united
states
which
is
--
which
has
expansive,
which
has
a
supple
term,
expanding
term,
but
or
any
department
or
office
of
that
kind
of
particularity.
the
last
codification
was
1878.
now,
in
1878,
i
don't
know
an
incorrect
--
you
inform
me,
i
don't
suppose
there
was
a
government
corporation,
they
were
government
incorporated,
government
charted
corporation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it?
smithsonian?
justice
felix
frankfurter
smithsonian.
even
there,
the
government
didn't
own
all
the
stock.
anyhow,
but
certainly
between
1878
and
down
to
1940,
beginning
with
the
panama
canal
and
so
on,
you
had
a
vast
number,
proliferating
phenomenon
in
regard
to
government
owned
corporations.
and
what
i
don't
understand
is
when
you
come
to
recodify
why
a
phrase
like
that
with
its
limitations
of
time
couldn't
have
been
changed
though
it's
the
including
things
without
having
all
this
litigation.
i
can
--
i
can
not
only
can
understand
but
i,
i
wrote
the
opinion
in
kieffer,
that's
a
different
problem,
whether
the
–
that
the
immunity
statute
should
apply.
that's
a
very
different
--
not
the
immunity
statute,
but
the
immunity
assumptions.
but
when
you
come
to
a
statute
which
has
this
particular
recession,
i
cannot
understand
why
you
do
not
get
clarifying
legislation,
why
congress
puts
it
in
and
then
we
are
argued
–
it's
argued
to
us,
“oh
well
don't
bother
about
that
phrase.
it
includes
everything
that
in
the
course
of
time
has
been
within
the
general
agents
of
the
united
states,”
which
is
your
argument.
that's
the
sum
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
--
i
do
injustice
through
what
they
follow,
i
know
but
that's
the
sum
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
1940,
in
1940
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
sure,
not
in
1878
but
what
about
1940
where
in
proposals,
when
everyone
of
these
provisions
in
draft
was
sent
to
department
of
justice
and
to
every
branch
of
the
governments
for
their
comments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
sins
of
your
predecessors
shall
descend
upon
you.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any,
mr.
doub,
is
there
any
government,
is
there
any
corporation,
any
corporate
body
in
which
the
government
has
shares
and
somebody
else
has
also
shares?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
they
be
--
would
they
be
the
government
of
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
government
has
any
--
doesn't
hold
any
shares
of
stock
in
a
national
bank,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
tva
is
a
formalism?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
a
lot
of
reality
behind
that
formalism,
isn't
there?
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
know
what
to
say,
i
don't
know
what
you
gain
by
calling
it
a
formalism.
a
certain
very
important
social
purposes,
economic
purposes,
political
purposes,
behind
the
utilization
of
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
this
--
i
didn't
get
to
try
to
get
it
shell,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
clarity,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
--
i
should
think
that
there
was
such
decisions
by
this
court,
it
would
have
been
a
--
so
long
incentive
and
has
been
an
impulse
to
rubbing
them,
wiping
them
off
the
books
if
times
have
changed
and
the
--
and
the
codification
process
after
that
proceeded
as
it
had
and
when
it
picked
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
haven't
they
--
aren't
there
some
corporations
which
have
some
properties,
corporate
properties
which
have
come
to
the
government
by
way
of
alien
property
custodian,
in
there
which
is
a
mix
--
what
you
call
a
hybrid
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
allowing
as
having
--
i
think
i
ought
to
distribute
my
favors
equally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
having
found
some
difficulty
with
mr.
doub's
argument,
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
that
the
--
that
the
content
of
a
term
of
generality,
for
instance,
i
would
have
no
trouble
at
all
if
this
was
the
government
of
the
united
states
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
can't
fix
the
meaning,
the
content
of
a
term
like
the
government
to
what
was
the
government
in
1878.
and
therefore,
this
sought
that,
it
must
be
as
of
the
time
that
it
was
written,
doesn't
mean
that
a
word
isn't
ambulatory
as
it
were,
if
it
doesn't
live
like
a
tree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
do
that,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
you
are
not
to
be
bound
as
you
said,
as
one
of
this
--
in
reading
a
statute,
a
statute
is
--
is
of
course
a
literary
composition,
but
its
also
something
else,
it's
a
projection
into
the
future.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
carries
all
the
meaning
that
fairly
may
be
contained
through
the
course
of
time
as
to
the
content
of
the
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
warren.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
propose
this
amendment?
did
the
--
did
the
department
of
justice
or
the
government
or
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
--
you
said
they
said,
who
is
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
said
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
case
is
that
mr.
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
where,
at
the
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
was
the
earlier
case
that
i
was
looking
up
if
i
recall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
strang.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
way
--
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
41.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
your
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
phrase
"government
department
or
officer
thereof."
did
that
originate
in
the
false
claims
statute
in
1963?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
wondering
why.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
reason
for
the
particularity
is
in
order
to
avoid
the
general
rule
which
you
invoked
of
not
having
a
criminal
statute
construed
beyond
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
delicately
narrow
limits
of
what
the
words
carry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
thought
they
covered
it
and
what
you
are
saying
is
they
didn't
cover
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
a
new
phenomenon
had
a
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
they
thought
they
covered
the
instrumentalities
that
where
the
government
as
of
1878
–
