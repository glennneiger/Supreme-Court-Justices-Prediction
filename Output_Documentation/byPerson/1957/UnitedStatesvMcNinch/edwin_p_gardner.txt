mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
mcninch
portion
of
the
case.
i'd
like
to
clarify
a
few
factual
situations
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
dismissing
the
complaint,
of
course,
we
had
to
admit
the
allegation.
what
happened
actually
in
the
mcninch
case
was
that
the
mcninch
people
were
contractors
operating
and
repairing
houses,
and
in
turn,
they
finance
their
customers
to
title
1
policies
ensured
by
the
fha.
now,
the
direct
question
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not
an
application
where
they
actually
ballooned
the
--
the
financial
resources
of
the
applicant,
who
owned
the
house,
who
was
getting
the
loans,
the
loans
made
in
his
name,
not
in
mcninch's
name,
but
then
went
to
the
bank.
our
sole
question
here,
as
i
see
it,
with
the
exception
of
what
mr.
epps
has
put
forward
and
i
believe
fha
as
far
as
they
intend
one
of
the
statute
go
is
the
same
as
the
government
corporation.
but
the
main
question
here
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
ballooning
of
an
application
for
loan
to
be
made
by
bank
to
a
third
party
constitutes
a
claim
within
the
contemplation
of
the
statute.
now,
this
case
has
been
decided
by
united
states
versus
cochran,
235
f.2d
131
certiorari
denied
352
u.s.
941,
and
also
by
united
states
versus
tieger,
234
f.2d
589,
certiorari
denied
352
u.s.
941.
the
facts
are
the
same.
i
think,
hereto,
we've
got
to
look
to
what
congress
meant.
now,
two
of
our
people
were
prosecuted
under
section
1010
title
18
u.s.c.
it
appears
on
page
8
of
the
mcninch's
brief.
now,
in
the
5438,
which
is
the
false
claims
statute,
a
criminal
statute,
the
penalties
were
five
years
or
$10,000,
and
that
was
a
claim.
in
1010
to
which
two
of
our
people
plead
guilty,
the
criminal
penalty
is
two
years
or
$5000.
now
this
statute
was
enacted,
as
i
understand
in
1939,
and
deals
entirely
with
what
we
have
here,
statements
to
the
fha
--
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
sir?
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
no
sir,
1010
is
not
here.
i
was
trying
to
point
out
that
what
our
people
were
convicted
of
was
a
lesser
crime
and
a
statute
much
broader
in
scope
than
the
original
false
claims
statute
and
the
civil
count
for
it
as
is
here
now,
1010
deals
primarily
with
exactly
what
happens
and
the
whole
essence
of
it
says,
anything
that
you
do
to
influence
fha
to
make
somebody
else
a
loan
so
that
it
can
be
ensured
is
criminal.
and
as
was
said
in
the
--
in
the
cochran
case,
certainly
our
people
were
properly
prosecuted.
well,
what
is
said
in
the
cochran
case,
i
believe,
is
true
here.
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
is
to
read
into
section
538
which
is
now
section
231,
the
civil
portion
of
the
3349,
is
to
read
into
231
that
same
language
as
is
contained
in
1010.
and
that
isn't
possible
because
in
order
to
be
guilty
under
the
hess
case,
and
mr.
justice
black
so
stated,
“in
order
to
be
guilty
under
the
civil
portion
of
the
false
claims
act,
you
had
to
have
committed
the
act
under
the
criminal
act.”
so,
actually,
you
have
to
have
the
same
counterpart
for
both
the
civil
act
and
the
criminal
act.
now
what
our
people
did
was
an
act
--
criminal
act
under
section
1010.
i
would
assume
that
the
government
thought
that
the
acts
that
our
people
committed
were
not
such
that
could
have
been
--
they
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
the
false
claims
statute.
certainly,
congress
didn't
apparently
think
that
on
this
representation
as
concerns
on
influence
for
an
fha
loans
to
a
lending
institution
certainly
didn't
think
that
that
fell
within
the
false
claims
statute
or
act
they
--
or
else
they
wouldn't
have
enacted
the
act.
now,
i
think
mr.
hastie
in
tieger
hit
the
nail
right
on
the
head
and
i
might
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
here
that
i
believe
mr.
doub
said
that
all
three
of
the
cases
are
both
the
third,
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
circuit
seem
to
think
that
this
might
have
someday
become
a
claim
if
there
had
been
any
loss
of
money
by
the
government.
i
think
the
only
reference
that
i
can
find
and
remember
is
the
statement
in
the
tieger
case
where
judge
hastie
said,
“true,
the
contract,
tieger,
induced
might
have
led
to
what
undoubtedly
would
be
considered
a
claim
against
the
united
states
but
it
never
did.”
and
he
goes
on
further
to
say,
“tieger
did
the
same
mcninch
did.”
he
says,
“and
certainly,
there
is
no
indication
that
tieger
intended
or
even
anticipated
any
default
by
the
bar
and
a
consequent
claim
on
the
guarantor.”
now,
what
the
government
is
saying
here
is
that
an
application
made
by
a
third
party
probably
prepared
by
mcninch,
what
it
was
--
i
think
what
happened
was
mcninch
knew
that
you
had
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
income
and
when
he
filled
out
these
application
banks,
he
boosted
their
income
a
little
bit,
the
man
signed
it,
sent
it
down
to
the
bank
along
with
the
other
necessary
papers,
the
bank
made
him
the
loan
and
then
the
bank
for
a
premium
that
pays
fha,
sends
it
off
to
fha
and
ask
them
to
insure
it.
now,
fha,
true,
is
bound
if
the
bank
acted
in
good
faith.
but
the
bank
does
not
have
to
go
against
the
insurance,
doesn't
have
to
make
this
claim,
most
of
the
time,
in
small
amount
as
like
this,
if
there
is
a
default,
they
prefer
to
collect
how
much
security
they
have.
but
the
question
is,
can
the
ballooning
on
that
application
in
any
sense
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
1878
be
a
claim?
cochran
says
it
was
not,
tieger
says
it
was
not,
there
wasn't
intended
to
be
one.
certainly,
it
have
to
be
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
--
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
to
fha?
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
i
--
it
would
have
pass
sir
that
financial
qualifications
of
the
applicant,
it
had
to
be
at
a
certain
level
for
a
certain
amount
of
loan.
apparently,
some
of
these
people
made
with
--
on
illustration,
i'd
say
$50
a
week
when
one
maybe
should
make
$60
a
week.
the
applicants
were
actually
--
applications
were
signed
by
the
applicants.
they
were
aware
that
it
was
ballooned.
now
--
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
that's
it
exactly
mr.
justice,
that's
it
exactly.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
am
glad
i
am
not
faced
with
that.
i
--
i
think
tieger
had
some
merit
there
because
in
order
to
have
a
default,
you
would
first
have
to
be
--
the
man
that
ballooned
it
would
have
to
know
that
there
was
a
default.
he'd
also
have
to
or
not
pay
it
because
he
intended
to
defraud.
i
think
you
have
to
have
the
intent
there
mr.
justice
douglas.
but
here,
sir?
but
here,
the
mere
ballooning
of
application,
certainly
in
my
opinion,
was
not
contemplated
by
congress
at
the
time
they
enacted
the
civil
false
claims
act.
and
it
certainly
indicated
that
they
later
came
along
and
if
i
would
like
to
pull
from
the
1010
statute
and
it
says
the
main
body
of
it,
1010
says,
and
for
--
or
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
in
any
way
the
action
of
such
administration.
now
i
think
it's
also
to
be
noted
that
--
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
that's
what
it
was
called
sir,
reading
it
says,
if
i
might
read
it
to
you,
“whoever,
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
any
loan
or
advance
of
credit
from
any
person,
partnership,
association,
or
corporation
with
the
intent
that
such
loan
or
advance
of
credit
shall
be
offered
to
or
accepted
by
the
federal
housing
administration
for
insurance,
or
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
any
extension
or
renewal
of
any
loan,
advance
of
credit,
or
mortgage
insured
by
such
administration,
or
the
acceptance,
release,
or
substitution
of
any
security
on
such
loan,
advance
of
credit,
or
for
the
purpose
of
influencing,
in
any
way
the
action
of
such
administration.”
and
then
it
goes
to
say,
he
will
be
fined
$5000
or
two
years
whereas
your
false
claim
statute
says,
if
you
claim,
then
you
to
be
are
fined
$10,000
or
five
years.
certainly,
congress
in
enacting
1010,
realized
that
these
acts
of
these,
our
defendant,
then
they
will
properly
prosecute
because
they
did
rather
a
false
statement.
they
were
properly
prosecuted
but
i
think
the
government,
if
they
had
thought
this
was
true,
it
would
have
prosecuted
on
the
civil
claims
act,
i
think
that's
true
because
of
this,
they
have
prosecuted
since
1939
numbers
of
cases
under
1010.
and
this
is
the
first
series
of
cases
brought
under
the
false
claims
civil
act
as
the
late
judge
parker
said,
that
they
seem
to
have
taken
the
little
jack
horner
theory,
somebody
stuck
his
finger
in
the
pie
and
come
up
with
a
plum.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
i
--
it
is
possible
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
no
sir,
there
has
been
no
questions.
the
--
the
decision
in
--
in
cochran,
i
believe,
and
also
in
tieger
says
if
it's
possible
to
view
this
commercially
advantageous
privilege
of
exchanging
a
little
money
for
such
an
aleatory
promises
a
claim
--
excuse
me,
they
just
say
it
that
this
is
a
conditional
contract
and
if
a
conditional
contract
was
contemplated
in
the
original
statute
as
being
a
--a
claim,
tieger
and
cochran
say
that
it
isn't.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
tieger
says
both
the
legislative
history
and
certain
language
of
the
false
claims
act
point
to
the
soundness
of
the
construction
which
thus
restricts
the
claim
against
the
united
states
to
this
conventional
meaning
of
demand
for
property
or
money.
and
then
the
court
there
goes
on
to
cite
the
cohn
case
where
it
said
that
it
is
a
claim
for
property
or
money.
and
of
course
as
judge
hastie
said,
the
government
has
said
that
this
is
dictum
and
i
would
like
to
quote
from
what
he
says,
he
says,
“seeking
to
minimize
the
force
of
this
construction,
the
government
calls
it
'dictum',
meaning,
a
parament
of
the
construction
was
more
restrictive
than
the
exigencies
of
the
case
required."
but
he
goes
on
to
say
that
“to
an
inferior
court,
it's
been
pointed
out
to
us
that
it's
a
claim
for
property
or
money.”
and
he
thinks
in,
as
i
--
believe
that
such
was
not
contemplated
within
the
meaning
of
the
original
act.
of
course,
mr.
epps
has
explained
the
history
behind
and
of
course
mr.
justice
black
has
pointed
out
in
the
hess
case
that
sound
statutory
interpretation
of
both
the
acts
require
that
they'd
be
considered
together.
i
might
add
--
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
no
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
no
sir,
it
would
not.
our
statute
is
exclusively
for
fha,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
believe
that
is
a
strengthening
part.
it
deals
with
--
i
believe
the
government
in
their
brief
said
they
have
thousands
of
these
things.
i
think
that's
why
fha
put
it
in
there.
they
realized
it
wasn't
a
claim
but
is
a
deterrent.
i
don't
know
under
commodity
whether
there
are
any
parallel
criminal
statutes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
in
the
claims
--
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
oh,
i
think
there
is
quite
a
distinct
difference
between
the
claims
and
the
two,
mr.
justice
black.
there
was
money
paid
out
in
commodity,
actually
paid
to
the
defendants
--
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
yes
sir,
a
false
note,
that's
--
that's
correct.
in
--
in
the
fha
proposition,
the
only
thing
that
was
falsified,
mr.
justice
black,
was
the
ballooning
of
credit
application.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
yes
the
criminal
act.
i
don't
think
it
comes
under
civil
counterpart
of
the
false
claims
act
which
we
have
here
now.
and,
it's
then
seen
by
three
courts,
third,
fifth
and
fourth
circuits.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
as
in
cochran
--
i
mean
in
rainwater
and
cato,
there
is
a
conflict
on
this
particular
point
being
the
same
in
both
tieger,
cochran
and
mcninch
here,
there
has
been
no
conflict
between
the
four.
thank
you.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
i
don't
believe
i
have
any
more
time.
mr.
edwin
p.
gardner
well
i'll
waive
that.
