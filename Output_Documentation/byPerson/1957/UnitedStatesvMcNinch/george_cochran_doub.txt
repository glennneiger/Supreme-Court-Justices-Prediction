mr.
george
cochran
doub
if
the
court
please.
these
are
three
separate
cases
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
each
involves
the
proper
scope
of
the
civil
false
claims
act.
in
the
mcninch
case,
originating
in
south
carolina,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
civil
false
claims
act
did
not
apply
to
fraudulent
applications
for
loans
guaranteed
by
the
federal
housing
administration.
in
the
toepleman
case,
originating
in
north
carolina,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
civil
false
claims
act
did
not
apply
to
fraudulent
applications
for
loans
to
the
commodity
credit
corporation
because
it
was
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation,
and
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation,
according
to
the
fourth
circuit,
is
not
a
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
and
in
the
cato
case,
originating
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
the
same
decision
was
made.
now,
the
facts
in
the
mcninch
case
were
these,
the
defendants
where
the
officers
and
--
and
the
salesmen
of
an
unincorporated
home
construction
business.
they
presented
to
a
south
carolina
bank,
an
fha
approved
lending
institution,
a
false
and
fraudulent
fha
loan
application
on
the
forms
of
fha
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
fha
guaranteed
loans
for
the
construction
or
repair
of
homes.
now,
the
applications
were
fraudulent
and
fictitious.
they
included
false
credit
reports
in
order
to
bring
the
applications
within
the
eligibility
provisions
of
the
statute.
our
complaint
under
the
civil
false
claims
act
alleged,
the
applications
or
claims
were
filed
with
the
intent
that
they
should
be
reported
to
and
accepted
by
fha
for
insurance.
that
is
the
guarantee.
well,
in
reliance
upon
the
integrity
of
the
applications,
the
bank
approved
the
loans,
reported
them
to
fha,
fha
guaranteed
payment
of
the
loans
to
the
bank
in
the
event
of
a
default
and
the
bank
made
the
loan
as
guaranteed
by
fha
to
these
applicants.
and
those
actual
payments
were
obtained.
now,
the
compliant
further
alleges
a
conspiracy
by
the
defendants
to
defraud
the
united
states
under
this
--
the
same
provisions
of
the
civil
false
claims
act
and
it
alleges
in
that
connection
that
the
defendants
obtained
2000
counterfeit
credit
report
forms
of
a
credit
company
for
this
fraudulent
purpose.
now,
i
might
say,
because
great
significance
is
attached
to
--
to
this
fact
by
the
lower
court
and
by
the
defendants,
after
the
discovery
of
the
fraud,
but
before
these
suits
were
instituted
and
before
criminal
suits
were
instituted,
the
defendants
bought
back
these
--
these
notes,
so
there's
been
no
default
on
the
notes
and
there
has
been
no
loss
by
fha.
now,
the
facts
in
these
cases
are
typical
of
thousands
referred
by
the
fha
to
the
department
of
justice
originating
all
over
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
type
of
fraud,
our
experience
shows
that
my
division
is
more
prevalent
numerically.
we
have
more
cases
numerically
of
this
type
than
under
any
government
program.
now
under
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
this
is
--
this
is
the
first
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
they
go
both
ways.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
[laughter]
i
don't
recall
that,
i
don't
believe
i
can
answer
that
point.
now,
let
me
remind
you
of
the
provisions
of
the
civil
false
claims
act.
it
provides
for
the
payment
to
the
united
states
of
the
sum
of
$2000
as
liquidated
damages
or
imputed
damages
or
forfeitures,
as
to
each
fraudulent
claim,
and
in
addition,
double
the
amount
of
actual
damages.
it's
applicable
to
anyone
who
makes
or
causes
to
be
made
or
presents
or
causes
to
be
presented
a
false
claim,
for
payment
or
for
approval,
by
any
person
or
officer
in
the
civil
--
civil
service
of
the
united
states.
and
it
covers
any
claim
upon
or
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
officer
thereof,
and
it
also
applies
to
obtaining
or
aiding
to
obtain
so
it
is
a
broad,
comprehensive
statute
and
there
are
no
qualifying
or
exclusionary
clauses.
now,
in
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
the
record
doesn't
show
that,
your
honor.
in
marcus
against
hess,
mr.
justice
black
said
for
the
--
for
unanimous
court
on
this
point
in
interpreting
the
civil
false
claims
act.
he
said
if
--
the
court
said
it
is
a
civil
remedial
statute
and
not
a
penal
statute.
it's
to
be
accorded
the
fair
meaning
of
its
intent.
it
was
immaterial
that
the
false
claims
were
filed
against
a
third
party
and
not
directly
with
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
there,
they
were
filed
with
their
municipality.
and
here,
they
were
filed
with
a
south
carolina
bank.
it
was
also
--
you
also
held
that
the
object
of
a
statute
was
to
provide
protection
against
those
who
would
cheat
the
united
states
and
to
reach
any
person
without
regard
to
whether
that
person
had
direct
contractual
relations
with
the
government,
and
that
is
also
true
here.
the
court
also
held
that
the
test
of
application
of
the
act
was
whether,
ultimately
and
eventually,
there
might
result
payment
of
government
money.
i
might
say
that
in
that
case,
that
was
a
case
where
fraudulent
claims
were
asserted
by
contractors
against
a
municipality
which
was
under
contract
with
pwa.
in
other
words,
pwa
was
supplying
a
great
deal
of
the
funds
for
the
construction
of
this
municipal
public
improvement.
and
so,
though
the
false
claims
were
presented
to
the
municipality,
the
loss
was
ultimately
born
by
the
treasury
of
the
united
states,
although
not
in
--
in
its
entirety,
only
in
part.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
followed
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
with
chief
judge
biggs
dissenting
in
the
opinion
in
the
cochran
case
of
the
fifth
circuit
with
judge
reed
dissenting,
holding
that
such
fraudulent
applications
did
not
constitute
claims
against
the
government
within
the
meaning
of
the
false
claims
act.
now,
the
--
these
circuits
strictly
interpreted
the
word
“claim”
in
the
false
claims
act
as
a
demand
for
money
or
property
as
a
right,
and
since
no
demands
were
made
for
the
payment
of
the
loans,
the
act
did
not
cover
the
transaction.
and
the
opinion
suggests
that
if
there
had
been
an
actual
default
on
the
loans,
and
if
there
had
been
an
actual
payment
by
fha,
then
the
act
would
apply.
but
here,
these
applications
were
made
upon
fha
titled
loan
credit
forms,
here
the
defendants
made
the
fraudulent
applications
with
the
objective
and
intent
in
understanding
that
they
would
be
reported
to
and
accepted
by
fha
for
guarantees.
here,
they
knew
the
bank
wouldn't
have
made
these
loans
except
for
the
government's
guarantee.
now,
what
was
the
essence
of
this
transaction?
upon
fha
approval
of
this
bank,
which
happened
before
these
applications
were
filed,
and
upon
the
filing
of
these
applications
on
these
fha
forms,
with
the
representations
made
in
--
in
them,
that
brought
them
within
the
scope
of
the
act
and
entitled
them
to
the
loan,
and
entitle
the
bank
to
the
guarantee
of
the
government.
and
when
the
bank
made
that
guarantee,
it
became
unqualifiedly
committed
as
the
guarantor
of
any
future
losses.
so,
we
say
that
these
applications
were
in
reality
and
practically
in
--
in
substance
directed
against
the
assets
of
the
united
states.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
word
“claim”
under
the
statute
goes
beyond
a
simple
demand
for
the
immediate
payment
of
money.
here,
the
claim,
the
fraudulent
claim
was
to
the
pledge
of
the
credit
of
the
united
states
and
it
was
that
guarantee
which
we
made,
and
we
say
that
guarantee
was
a
property.
now,
you'll
notice
this
no
restrictive
language
in
the
statute
as
to
the
word
“claim”.
it
says,
any
claim,
which
would
ordinarily
mean
all
claims.
it
refers
not
merely
to
payment,
but
payment
or
approval
of
a
fraudulent
claim.
now,
the
third
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
interpret
this
statute
as
directed
the
claims
for
money
or
property.
we
don't
object
to
that.
and
--
and
i
think
that's
undoubtedly
so,
but
we
say
the
word
“property”
shouldn't
have
been
restricted
by
those
circuits
to
tangible
property,
that,
of
course,
it
covers
property
in
its
ordinary
sense,
tangibles
or
intangibles.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
if
the
bank
is
at
--
if
the
bank
did
not
know
of
the
misrepresentations,
the
--
the
government
has
logged
on
its
contract
to
guarantee.
so,
all
we're
--
the
--
the
real
issue
in
this
case
we
--
we
submit
is
this,
is
a
contract
of
guarantee
--
is
a
pledge
to
the
credit
of
the
united
states
property,
if
so,
this
was
a
claim
for
property
under
the
civil
false
claims
act.
now,
we
say
property
should
be
deemed
to
include
a
franchise,
a
patent,
a
copyright,
a
contract
of
insurance,
a
contract
of
guarantee,
a
contract
of
indemnity,
any
that
shows
an
action
of
any
legal
right.
i
might
remind
you
of
what
this
court
said
in
the
arenz
case
in
290
u.s.
66,
which
i
don't
think
is
on
our
brief,
in
construing
the
word
“property”
in
a
statute.
we
said
--
it's
fidelity
and
deposit
company
against
arenz,
290
u.s.
66.
and
this
is
a
way
you
construe
the
word
“property”
in
a
federal
statute.
property
is
a
word
of
very
broad
meaning
and
when
used
without
qualification,
expressly
made
or
plainly
implied,
it
reasonably
may
be
construe
to
include
obligations,
rights
and
other
intangibles
as
well
as
physical
things.
and
then
in
lynch
against
united
states
in
292
u.s.,
and
an
opinion
by
justice
brandeis
who
held
at
war
risk
insurance
policies
being
contracts
for
property
and
created
vested
rights.
and
so,
we
say
here,
that
fha
applications,
fraudulent
ones,
that
these
defendants
for
a
loan
guaranteed
by
fha
were
a
claim
for
a
contract
of
indemnity.
now,
the
--
the
third
circuit
and
the
fifth
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
has
made
--
made
another
false
distinction,
we
believe.
they
say
that
the
test
of
liability
is
whether
that's
what's
involved
on
the
loan,
which
suggest
that
the
government,
after
discovering
a
fraud,
would
sit
idly
by
to
ascertain
whether
a
default
occurred
before
the
six-year
statute
of
limitation
as
far
as
the
action,
or
see
whether
the
defrauders
--
would
accord
the
defrauders
an
opportunity
to
buy
the
notes
in
case
of
a
default
to
prevent
a
call
upon
the
guarantee.
of
course,
it
would
be
practically
an
invitation
to
fraud.
it
would
be
an
engine
of
fraud.
it
would
be
an
invitation
to
take
a
gamble.
if
the
fraud
isn't
discovered,
there's
no
problem.
if
fraud
is
discovered,
buy
the
notes
back,
and
you
could
have
a
loss
of
evidence,
the
government
has
to
wait
after
it
discovers
the
fraud
for
--
for
perhaps
years.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
did
not
say
it
was
in
the
statute.
i
said
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
that
the
third
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
have
interpreted
the
statute
as
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
applying
the
claims
for
money
or
property.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
i
accept
that.
now,
it's
not
necessary
under
this
statute,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
government
suffer
a
pecuniary
loss.
the
statute
isn't
in
terms
of
loss.
the
wrongful
act
is
not
the
obtaining
of
money
or
property
by
fraud,
it's
not
defrauding
the
government.
the
wrongful
act,
the
offense
is
not
cheating
the
government,
but
it
is
attempting
to
cheat
the
government.
then
mr.
justice
black
said
in
his
opinion
in
marcus
against
hess,
it
applies
to
those
who
would
cheat
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
then
the
--
the
$2000
liquidated
damage,
a
forfeiture
provision.
obviously,
it
designed
to
cover,
to
impute
damages
to
the
government,
although,
it
maybe
unable
to
prove
any.
though
the
statute
assumes
an
injury
by
that
forfeiture
provision,
it
imputes
liquated
damages
and
that
--
are
desirable,
because
whenever
there
is
an
attempted
fraud,
though
not
successful,
is
investigative
expense
and
clerical
expense
and
legal
expense.
so,
we
say
there
is
no
requirement
statutory
or
judicial
that
specific
damages
be
shown.
in
rex
trailer
company,
mr.
justice
clark
said
for
the
court
in
--
for
unanimous
court
in
that
case,
and
that
the
language
of
that
statute,
the
surplus
property
act,
was
somewhat
similar
to
this,
it
can
be
distinguished
but
he
said
the
fact
that
no
damages
are
shown
is
not
fatal.
and
we
say
his
language
there
should
be
applied
here.
so,
we
suggest
respectfully
that
there
is
no
valid
distinction
between
default
and
pre-default
claim.
the
distinction
made
is
artificial.
it's
unrealistic.
and
so,
it
follows
that
when
there
is
a
fraudulent
application,
a
fraudulent
claim
for
a
guaranteed
fha
loan,
the
statute
has
been
violated,
and
that
is
the
wrongful
act,
filing
the
claim.
and
that
wrongful
act,
which
is
its
basis,
is
the
same,
whether
there
is
a
loss,
actual
loss
by
the
government
or
not,
default
is
not
critical,
but
the
filing
of
the
false
claim
is.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
toepleman
case
and
the
cato
case,
one
is
in
north
carolina
and
one
from
virginia.
there,
the
government
brought
suits
under
the
same
civil
false
claims
act
for
alleged
frauds
upon
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
commodity
credit
had
authorized
the
defendant
corporations
as
commodity's
agents
to
make
non-recourse
loans
to
purchasers
of
eligible
1948
crop
cut.
now,
the
defendants
submitted
to
commodity
credit
corporation
hundreds
of
notes,
fraudulent
notes
of
alleged
cotton
producers.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
if
they
falsely
certify
that
the
note
makers
had
produced
cotton.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
note
makers
had
sold
their
cotton
to
the
defendants
and
had
no
further
interest
in
the
cotton.
and
the
defendants
persuaded
and
are
induced
the
producers
of
the
cotton
to
sign
these
notes
or
--
or
rather
applications,
these
false
statements
that
they
had
produced
the
cotton
even
after
they
had
purchased
their
cotton
and
they
had
no
further
interest
in
it.
they
also
falsely
certified
that
the
benefit
of
the
loan
would
accrue
solely
to
the
note
maker
and
that
was
untrue
because
they
--
they
weren't
going
accrue
to
the
note
makers,
they
were
going
to
accrue
to
the
defendants
who
had
purchased
this
cotton.
they
also
falsely
alleged
the
benefits
below,
and
it
had
not
been
transferred
to
any
other
party.
now,
on
the
basis
of
these
false
statements,
the
defendants
obtained
payment
of
these
fraudulent
notes
from
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
now,
actually
they
made
no
dispersement
to
the
purchasers
or
rather
to
the
producers,
the
latter
having
no
interest
in
them
and
they
retained
these
commodity
payment.
in
other
words,
here
was
just
a
fraudulent
scheme
of
some
cotton
brokers
to
protect
themselves
from
loss.
the
price
of
cotton
went
up,
and
probably
that
was
one
thing.
but
if
the
price
of
cotton
fell,
this
cotton
they
had
bought
from
the
real
producers,
then
they
would
be
protected
by
obtaining
these
payments
on
these
fraudulent
notes
from
the
commodity
credit
corporation.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
this
commodity
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
in
these
cases,
yes.
in
these
cases,
there
were
losses?
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no
actual
loss,
because
these
defendants
bought
up
these
notes
and
i
think
they
bought
them
up
after
they
--
they
discovered
that
we
had
discovered
the
fraud.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
civil
false
claims
act
did
not
apply
to
frauds
upon
the
commodity
credit
corporation
of
the
type
i
have
just
described
on
one
simple
single
ground
and
that
is
that
commodity
credit
was
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation.
and
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation
is
not
a
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
correct.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i
accept
your
qualification.
so,
the
court
held
that
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation,
though
operating
exclusively
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
though
executing
a
federal
government
program
with
public
money
is
not
a
part
of
the
federal
government
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
it
came
in
at
1940,
i
might
say
this
about
the
--
about
the
statute.
it
originated
in
1863
by
virtue
of
the
extensive
frauds
perpetrated
upon
the
government
during
the
civil
war.
it
was
reenacted
in
1873
and
reenacted
again
in
1878.
now,
the
--
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
don't
recall
and
it
was
codified
in
the
code.
i
might
say
that
the
--
there
are
two
separate
statutes
that
are
involved
in
the
3490,
3490
which
was
adopted
in
1878
or
reenacted
then,
refers
to
--
incorporates
by
reference
the
criminal
statute
known
as
5438
and
we
agree
with
counsel
for
the
defendants
in
all
of
these
cases
that
in
interpreting
these
statutes,
you
must
interpret
the
--
the
5438,
the
criminal
statute
which
was
embodied
in
this
by
reference
in
3490
as
it
was
enacted
in
1878.
and
that
criminal
statute
has
been
modified
and
amended
many
times
since
then.
we
agree
those
amendments
were
not
incorporated
into
the
civil
false
claims
act.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
there's
only
one.
mr.
george

there
was
only
one.

mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i'll
state
the
sum
of
it
this
way,
the
respondents
contend
that
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
in
reenacting
this
false
claims
act
in
1878
considered
and
intended
and
determined
that
a
government
corporation
so,
such
as
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
should
be
included
within
its
terms
and
they
say
congress
didn't
so
intend
because
there
were
no
such
corporations,
that
was
your
point
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
1878
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
i'm
afraid
i
didn't
--
it
was
not
in
the
court
of
justice
and
with
justice
frankfurter
and
i
did
owe
responsibility
for
these
statutes
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
through
our
answering
the
defendants'
contention,
as
i
have
stated
it,
we
submit
that's
not
equality.
it's
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
show
that
congress
in
1878
determined
to
include
a
specific
form
of
government
activity
which
is
not
then
developed.
the
true
inquiry,
we
say
is,
did
congress
then
intends
by
the
use
of
this
broad
language
of
the
act
to
include
all
fraudulent
claims
against
the
government
regardless
of
the
type
of
government
agencies
which
existed
then
or
might
develop
thereafter.
in
another
words,
did
by
using
this
broad
language,
congress
intend
that
the
act
should
be
applied
not
only
to
existing
known
departments
of
the
government,
but
to
any
new
types
of
government
agencies,
to
any
new
corporate
forms
of
activity
provided,
then
in
reality
and
in
substance,
they
were
a
part
of
the
government.
now,
we're
unable
to
find
sufficient
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
commodity
credit
and
the
government
itself.
let
me
explain
what
commodity
credit
is.
it's
defined
in
the
statute
to
be
an
agency,
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
within
the
department
of
agriculture,
it
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
stabilizing
foreign
income
and
prices,
so
it
has
a
public
purpose.
it's
not
a
private
banking
venture,
for
instance
like,
a
national
bank
incorporated
under
federal
law.
it's
manned
entirely
by
officers
and
employees
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
all
of
its
personnel
are
--
their
salaries
are
paid
by
the
department
of
agriculture.
it
has
no
officers,
it
has
no
directors,
it
has
no
employees
outside
the
department
of
agriculture
or
independent
of
agriculture.
now
it's
been
--
the
statute
further
provides
that
commodity
has
all
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
of
united
states
with
respect
to
priority
of
payment
of
debts
from
--
under
--
in
bankruptcy.
its
obligations
are
deemed
in
the
instrumentality
for
the
united
states.
it
--
its
income
is
exempted
from
federal
and
state
taxation.
suits
may
be
brought
directly
against
the
united
states
on
its
obligations.
although,
if
charter
says
it
might
sue
and
it
may
be
sued,
and
the
united
states
may
sue
anyone
in
its
own
name
upon
claims
of
commodity
credit.
all
of
its
capital
came
from
the
treasury
of
united
states
and
it's
authorized
to
borrow
up
to
$14.5
billion
upon
the
credit
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
hasn't
borrowed
any
--
it
--
it
borrows
from
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
and
then
periodically,
congress
cancels
the
debt.
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
there
are
such
types
of
corporations
and
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
there
are
number
of
them
listed
and
i'll
give
you
a
--
a
reference,
if
i
may,
later.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
they
would
not,
they
would
not,
neither
would
national
banks,
neither
would
any
corporations
in
which
the
government
merely
has
a
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
but
they
are
--
there
are
agencies
and
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
with
certain
purposes.
but
what's
involved
here
is
something
very
different
from
that
--
before
i'd
like
to
--
before
i
leave
the
commodity
credit,
i
want
to
point
this
out,
the
agricultural
act
of
1949
direct
the
secretary
in
making
cotton
loans
to
support
the
price
of
cotton
through
the
use
of
commodity
credit
corporation
and
other
means
available.
the
1948
act
is
similar
language.
now,
in
rainwater,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
commodity
credit
was
nothing
but
a
book
keeping
device
for
the
handling
of
government
money.
it
was
a
matter
of
form
which
should
not
be
allowed
to
obscure
substantive
realities,
and
in
view
of
your
functional
interpretation
of
this
false
claims
act
in
marcus
against
hess.
and
the
eighth
circuit
could
find
no
material
distinction
between
your
decision
as
to
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation
and
this
situation,
because
in
cherry
cotton
mills
against
united
states
where
you
permitted
the
united
states
to
sue
on
obligations
due
the
rfc,
this
court
said
that
the
congress
chose
to
call
it
a
corporation.
it
does
not
honor
its
characteristic
so
to
make
it
something
other
than
what
is
actually
is,
an
agency
selected
by
the
government
to
accomplish
purely
a
governmental
purpose.
now,
we
say
that
the
restrictive
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit,
which
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
eighth
circuit,
limiting
the
scope
of
the
false
claims
act,
we
think
it
ignores
the
realities
of
the
situation
and
the
substance
of
the
situation
in
adhering
their
corporate
section
formalism.
and
we
think
it's
at
variance
with
your
decision
in
marcus
against
hess.
remember,
there,
you
held
that
the
statute
applied,
the
claims
against
the
municipality
where
the
laws
ultimately
was
born
by
the
treasury
of
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
i
do,
sir.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
tva
is
a
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
have
a
far
stronger
case
here
mr.
justice
frankfurter
than
we
would
have
it
if
we
were
dealing
with
tva.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
here,
we're
dealing
with
nothing
but
a
shell.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
as
i
was
suggesting
in
marcus
against
hess,
if
you
held
a
test
of
liability
under
this
act
and
its
coverage
was
the
source
of
the
money
and
whether
the
financial
loss
will
ultimately
be
born
by
the
united
states.
there,
you
treated
false
claims
within
the
act
when
they
were
not
against
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation
but
against
a
wholly
independent,
independent
entity
with
no
relation
to
the
united
states
except
under
contract,
namely,
state
municipalities
and
school
district
and
if
you
held
the
act
of
cowardice
unanimously
on
that
point.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
my
answer
to
that
is
this,
that
amendment
goes
far
beyond
what
we
are
contending
for.
if
it
--
it
extended
the
false
claims
act
to
any
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
had
a
stock
interest.
now,
we're
not
going
that
far.
we're
not
contending
for
that,
we
are
not
contending
that
if
the
united
states
had
a
stock
interest
in
a
railroad
or
some
other
venture
and
there's
a
private
capital
in
that
venture,
perhaps,
a
private
management,
courses
that
you
wouldn't
cover
but
that
that
amendment
would,
that
amendment
would
apply
to
such
corporation.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
of
course
there
was
no
reason
to
amend
the
--
no
they
didn't.
no
amendments
were
made
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
well,
i
think
that's
the
principal
contention
of
the
respondent
and
that
they
rely
largely
upon
that
amendment
to
the
criminal
act
and
the
courts
--
the
--
the
criminal
act
that's
applicable
here
is
the
one
that's
enacted
in
this
1878
form.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
my
--
my
contention
is
that
if
that
amendment
had
merely
provided
that
it
should
--
the
statute
should
be
extended
to
apply
to
wholly
owned
government
corporation,
then
i
think
they'd
have
a
good
point.
but
it
doesn't
do
that,
it
goes
far
beyond
that.
it
applies
to
any
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
has
a
stock
interest
and
that
could
be
a
majority
stock
interest
or
a
minority
stock
interest
or
10
shares.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
of
course,
we're
executing
intentions
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
that's
enough
to
--
to
--
for
you
to
accept,
the
--
the
notion
that
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
a
mere
shell
--
within
the
department
of
justice
is
not
a
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
suppose
it
became
desirable
and
congress
deemed
it
efficient
and
desirable
for
the
--
for
us
to
incorporate
veterans
administration
or
federal
housing
administration
or
perhaps
the
department
of
justice.
functions
are
performed
in
the
same
way,
only
then
to
be
said
we
are
outside
the
government,
we've
been
pushed
through
the
door,
we've
taken
on
some
sort
of
debts
of
a
--
of
a
private
corporation,
i
think
it's
an
emphasis
upon
artificial
formulas
and
it
goes
beyond
what
i
could
accept.
so,
we
contend
that,
first,
that
all
wholly
owned
government
corporations
fulfilling
a
public
purpose
in
utilizing
treasury
bonds
could
be
deemed
a
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
a
department
thereof,
and
this
is
an
appropriate
time
at
long
last
to
override
to
override
--
to
override
several
decisions
made
when
there
were
a
few
pioneered
corporations
created,
that
is
united
states
fleet
corporation
in
1918.
and
the
court
did
accept
them
as
separate
entities.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
took
a
different
position
from
that,
in
western
union
telegraph
company
against
united
states
fleet
corporation.
there,
he
held
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation.
it
was
a
department
of
the
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
was
for
the
--
in
interpreting
a
contract
between
western
union
and
the
united
states,
and
the
question
was
whether
the
fleet
corporation
was
entitled
to
favorable
government
rates
under
a
contract
that
provided
it
would
be
applicable
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
its
departments.
now,
the
--
the
language
of
that
contract
is
identical
with
the
language
in
this
statute
by
coincidence
and
yet
you
said
for
unanimous
court,
you
said
for
unanimous
court
that
the
united
states
fleet
corporation
was
a
wholly
owned
government
corporation
and
that
was
a
department
of
the
united
states.
but
if
you
don't
accept
that
theory,
you're
not
prepared
to
go
that
far,
and
to
say
that
wholly
owned
government
corporations,
operating
exclusively
for
a
public
purpose,
exclusively
with
public
funds
is
not
--
are
not
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
then
we
ask
you
to
hold
that
in
any
event,
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
merely
a
creature
or
agency
within
the
department
of
agriculture
without
any
independent
office
or
directors
or
any
office
of
its
own,
that
in
any
event,
that
mere
conduit
to
fulfill
the
secretary's
programs
should
be
deemed
a
part
of
the
united
states
and
within
the
statute.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
fha,
the
problem
is
entirely
different.
fha
is
not
a
corporation,
so
the
question
in
mcninch
case
is
the
--
is
the
other
one.
