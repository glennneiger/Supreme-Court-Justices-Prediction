justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
when
you
say
--
you
said
that
they
made
restitution
(inaudible)
going
to
report
back
to
denounce
prior
to
that
point.
what
was
it
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
government
remain
or
the
fha
remain
on
the
hook,
once
it
is
discovered
that
there
has
been
a
fraudulent
application
for
a
loan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
do
you
find
the
word
“property”,
according
to
government
of
property
in
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
shipping
corporations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
the
circumstances
in
1918?
the
criminal
false
claims
act
was
amended
to
add
specifically
government
owned
corporations
or
as
nothing
was
done
about
the
civil
false
claims
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
why
didn't
they
also
include
within
that
coverage
the
civil
false
claims
act
as
well.
they
amendment
it
only
criminally
to
be
applied
to
partially
owned
government
corporations
that
they
didn't
carry
even
that
amendment
into
the
civil
--
civil
false
claims
act,
civil
false
claims
liability.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
why
didn't
they,
that's
a
simple
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
raised
it
with
you
because
i
thought
it
was
a
strong
argument
and
i
wanted
to
hear
what
your
answer
was?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
a
reason
why
the
government
--
why
the
congress
should
be
one
of
those
corporations
--
false
claims
respecting
those
corporations,
partially
owned
corporations
held
criminally
liable
but
not
civilly
liable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
know
that
and
you've
got
that
serious
thing
right
on
the
face
of
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
drawing
a
distinction
between
that
and
fha?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
--
what's
that
decision,
excuse
me.
what's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that
legislative
history
referred
to?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
purpose?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
purpose
of
making
the
false
statement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
