mr.
a.
c.
epps
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i,
in
this
case,
am
counsel
for
cato
brothers,
the
two
individual
cato
men
and
mrs.
dunn
nee
stone,
that's
one
of
these
three
cases,
they
are
three
separate
cases
from
three
separate
districts
in
three
different
states
being
heard.
i
say
that
because
a
--
a
portion
of
the
argument
only
deals
with
my
clients.
i
must
say
that
the
petitioner's
argument,
while
i
find
it
persuasive
and
powerful,
is
addressed,
i
think,
to
the
wrong
form.
i
think
they
could
be
talking
to
congress
and
not
to
this
topic.
the
hess
case
has
been
referred
to
and
i
refer
to
certain
language
of
this
court
in
the
hess
case,
page
542,
sound
rules
of
statutory
construction
exist
to
discover
and
not
direct
to
congressional
will.
the
government
presses
upon
those
strong
arguments
of
policy
against
the
statutory
plan.
but
the
entire
force
of
these
considerations
as
directed
solely
at
what
the
government
think
congress
should
have
done,
rather
than
what
it
did,
and
then
finally
on
547,
and
finally
their
conditions
have
changed
since
the
act
was
passed
in
1863.
but
the
trouble
with
these
arguments
is
that
they
are
addressed
to
the
wrong
form.
conditions
may
have
changed,
but
the
statute
has
not.
now,
i
was
talking
about
this
statute
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
point.
now,
the
government
has
known
about
this
government
corporation
technicality
since
1938.
they
were
held
against
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
the
salzman
salant
case,
in
1938
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
the
gilchrist
case.
they
have
had
us
on
the
griddle
since
1948,
there
--
this
is
our
10th
anniversary
in
this
case.
and
they
haven't
done
anything
so
far
as
congress
is
concerned.
we
think
that
20
years
is
time
enough
for
the
problem
to
go
to
congress.
now,
they
are
found
to
argue
that
a
functional
approach
or
expediency,
if
you
will,
is
to
make
a
note,
the
act
of
congress
which
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
in
1918,
and
to
change
the
intent
of
congress
in
1878
which
was
the
last
time
the
statute
was
amended.
this
case
involves,
if
you
please,
the
construction
of
a
criminal
statute,
5438
of
the
revised
statutes,
as
they'd
existed
in
1878
and
that
criminal
statute,
if
you
please,
should
not
be
extended
by
interpretation
and
in
line
with
fundamental
principles,
it
must
define
a
criminal
act
with
certainty.
now,
how
do
we
get
to
that
and
why
do
i
say
that?
this
is
a
case
upon
the
case
of
the
incorporation
by
reference,
if
you
please.
the
government
has
now
graciously
conceded
that
they
misquoted
the
statute.
they
did
so
--
they
--
perhaps,
my
purpose
is
very
important.
the
revised
statutes,
3490,
unchanged
since
1878,
if
you
will,
is
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
this
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
government,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
government,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
problem.
and
this
was
the
statute
which
they
are
suing
us
on.
any
person,
not
in
the
military
or
naval
forces
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
militia
called
into
or
actively
employed
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
who
shall
do
or
commit
any
of
the
acts
prohibited
by
any
of
the
provisions
of
section
4400
and
38
title
crimes,
shall
forfeit
and
pay
to
the
united
states
the
sum
of
$2000,
and
in
addition,
double
the
amount
of
damages
which
the
united
states
may
have
sustained
by
reason
of
the
doing
or
committing
such
acts
together
with
the
cost
for
suit
and
such
forfeiture
and
damages
shall
be
sued
buying
the
same
suit.
that
is
the
civil
statute
which
is
unchanged.
and
that
is
the
incorporating
statute,
if
you
please.
now,
revised
statutes
5438,
which
were
incorporated
as
we
have
seen,
define
the
crime,
and
this
is
a
criminal
statute
which
we
say
cannot
be
extended
by
interpretation
and
must
define
the
crime
of
reasonable
service.
as
it
existed
in
--
in
1878,
that
statute
did
not
say
anything
about
the
government
corporation.
it
didn't
know
anything
about
government
corporations,
except
the
smithsonian
institute
which
merely
said.
but
this
is
--
part
of
the
fact
that
that
statute
has
been
off,
it
has
been
amended,
repealed,
reenacted
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
1918,
they
came
in
and
included
a
government
corporation.
and
incidentally,
it
was
not
a
partially
owned
government
corporation
because
mr.
justice
holmes
in
u.s.
against
walter,
if
it
please
the
court,
said
it
was
such
a
corporation
that
--
that
was
totally
owned
by
the
government
and
it
had
to
be
or
else
the
law
would
have
been
unconstitutional,
the
amendment
would
have
been
unconstitutional.
and
it
specifically
held
that
it
was
limited
to
such
corporations
as
were
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states,
so
i
think
that
put
such
questions
to
rest.
now,
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
the
affect
of
this
amendment,
of
these
amendments
to
the
incorporated
statute
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
united
states
against
walter,
if
you
please
sir,
263
u.s.
15.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
justice
holmes'
opinion
and
he
says
quite
clearly
that
if
it
was
the
type
of
corporation
which
--
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
monarch
and
stock
holder,
for
example,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
--
for
the
statute
to
say
any
corporation
in
which
their
stock
is
owned,
because
the
man
might
trade
with
any
corporation
at
his
peril,
but
if
he
reads
into
that
amendment,
the
limitation
that
the
corporation
covered
by
that
amendment
must
be
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
he
does
so
in
that
walter
case.
and
that's
a
--
that's
a
complete
answer
to
the
argument
of
the
hybrid
corporation
which
the
government
is
making
here.
now
--
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
sir
i
would
speak
only
from
ignorance,
i
do
know
that
there
are
certain
corporations
that
--
that
are
not
wholly
owned
such
as
federal
land
bank,
i
think,
is
one
of
them.
there
are
some
mentioned
in
the
government
corporation
control
act
to
some
four
or
five
of
them.
land
bank
is
one
of
them.
that
is
the
case
which
you
give
maybe
but
--
and
i
would
think
there
would
be.
now,
the
effect
of
the
amendment
of
the
incorporated
statute,
if
you
please,
cannot
change
the
ambit
or
the
scope
of
the
incorporating
statute,
the
civil
statute
which
has
not
been
changed
since
1878,
must
be
read
and
so
must
the
incorporated
statute
be
read
as
both
existed
in
1878,
not
1940
sir.
but
as
they
both
stood
in
1878,
because
this
court
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
we
can
show
by
what
congress
itself
said
it
meant
in
1918.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
and
what
the
court
said
it
meant,
that
it
did
not
mean
a
government
corporation
and
i
think
we
are
bound
by
that.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
with
certain
qualifications,
if
you
please
sir,
a
criminal
statute
since
this
is
a
criminal
statute
and
that's
the
only
thing
that
has
been
amended,
must
define
a
crime
with
certainty
and
must
not
be
extended
by
interpretation.
now,
the
case
of
the
proprietors
of
the
bridge
against
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
that
say
as
that
when
you
say
bridge
in
--
in
1790,
you
don't
mean
railroad
bridge
70
years
later
and
so
it
took
--
there
has
the
limitation
on
the
point
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
makes
i
believe.
now,
we
say
that
this
modern
trend
argument
is
trying
to
put
an
amendment
now
into
this
criminal
statute
which
is
not
there.
but
it
was
put
there
in
1918,
put
there
by
congress,
which
meant
that
it
wasn't
covered
before
congress
put
it
there.
now,
one
comment
about
our
facts
that
i
want
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
and
the
judicial
decisions,
it
was
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
our
claims
were
submitted
to
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
not
the
united
states
government,
and
it
was
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
government
suffered
no
legally
recoverable
damages
in
our
case.
with
the
amendments
which
i
shall
take,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
seems
highly
important
that
we
must
search
the
meaning
of
section
5438
of
the
revised
statutes.
as
it
existed,
or
what
it
meant
in
1878,
as
it
has
been
shown
to
have
been
interpreted
since
that
time,
and
we
look
to
the
legislative
history
and
we
look
to
judicial
opinion.
now,
the
--
this
legislative
history
shows
clearly
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
cover
a
government
corporation,
about
5438
in
1878
and
that
their
cases
show
that
they
--
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
cover,
it
did
not
cover.
now,
it's
already
been
pointed
out
that
5438
makes
it
a
crime
to
present
a
claim
against
the
government
of
the
united
states,
department
of
the
united
states
or
any
officer
that
govern,
that's
all.
now,
while
it's
true
that
this
was
3490
should
be
construed
broadly
to
protect
the
treasury,
still
in
1918
after
5438
had
gone
through
various
amendments
and
become
section
35
of
the
criminal
code,
if
you
please,
in
1918,
section
35
was
amended
by
congress
to
include
or
any
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
of
america
is
a
stockholder,
and
that
means
as
we
have
seen
that
it
must
be
such
a
corporation
as
to
be
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
not
just
any
corporation.
congress
was
too
broad,
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
if
it
had
been
that
board.
now,
was
this
amendment
an
extension
of
the
terms
of
the
law
or
was
it
just
a
clarification?
we
think
that
we
can
show
clearly
that
it
wasn't
extension.
now,
the
committee
reports
in
talking
of
that
amendment
had
this
to
say,
representative
guard
says,
the
amendment
served
to
fully
reenact
and
reinforce
the
provisions
of
section
35
of
the
criminal
code,
so
that
it
will
include
all
the
offense
heretofore
contained
there
in,
and
an
offense
against
any
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
stockholder.
again,
when
it
was
explained
the
bill,
mr.
representative
(inaudible),
said,
"the
only
amendments
to
the
existing
laws
are
the
extension
of
the
penalty
of
this
act
to
false
and
fraudulent
claims
that
are
presented
against
corporations
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
stockholder,"
an
extension
if
you
will.
once
again,
when
the
bill
was
received
from
the
senate,
mr.
(inaudible)
said,
“this
amendment”,
and
i
have
to
quote
him,
“at
section
35
as
amended
to
extend
the
law
to
false
and
fraudulent
claims
made
against
a
corporation
in
which
the
united
stated
is
a
stockholder.
well,
if
they
were
going
to
extend
the
law
to
the
corporations
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
stockholder,
it
could
never
applied
prior
to
1918."
mr.
a.
c.
epps
in
page
12
and
13
of
our
briefs.
it's
a
--h.r.
report
668,
65th
congress
second
section
9
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
that's
my
understanding
sir.
the
reason
they
had
done
it
sir
and
the
bramblett
case,
this
is
my
next
point,
but
i'm
glad
to
get
to
it,
the
reason
they
had
done
it
was
that
prior
to
1918,
they
had
tried
to
prosecute
people
under
5438
or
then
section
35
and
they
said
it
didn't
cover
government
corporations,
so
they
had
to
come
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
the
court
said
so.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
yes
sir,
the
court
said
it
didn't
cover.
now
that's
in
the
bramblett
case
sir,
cited
in
our
brief,
u.s.
against
bramblett,
shows
that
history,
120
f.supp.
and
it's
348
u.s.
503.
there
were
judicial
cases
that
said
that
they
didn't
cover.
now,
there
are
other
cases
which
deal
with
the
history,
united
states
against
bowman
states
that
section
35
was
amended
in
--
in
1918
to
extend
the
act
to
cover
a
government
corporation,
united
states
against
bowman
that
is.
a
very
helpful
case
is
pierce
against
the
united
states,
decided
this
court
in
1941
involving,
if
you
please,
the
tva.
and
section
32
of
the
criminal
code
which
has
language
almost
identical
to
section
35,
now,
this
man
had
pretended
to
be
an
officer
of
the
tva.
and
in
doing
so,
the
government
tried
to
prosecute
him
for
pretending
to
be
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
the
particular
words
of
the
statute
in
32
are
just
about
identical
to
the
words
here
using
government
or
officer
of
department
thereof.
and
this
court
said
that
the
crime
could
not
be
proved
under
section
32
of
the
criminal
code
and
by
way
of
passing
and
pointed
out
the
extension
of
35
that
it
was
similar.
and
–-
mr.
a.
c.
epps
pierce
against
the
united
states,
if
you
please
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
this
court
sir
in
1941.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
was
it
walter
u.s.?
mr.
a.
c.
epps
strang
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
it
was
in
strang
too
sir.
strang
was
section
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
--
41,
i
was
just
get
to
that,
that
was
the
fleet
corporation
sir
and
it
was
a
question
of
whether
a
man
could
have
interest
and
still
deal
with
the
government.
but
pierce
is
a
later
case
and
it
involves
the
tva
and
is
very,
very
helpful
on
this
point.
did
you
ask
for
that
citation?
mr.
a.
c.
epps
all
right.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
all
right
sir.
as
i
say,
this
man
had
been
pretending
to
be
or
was
charged
with
being
a
--
officer
of
the
tva.
now,
after
he
was
indicted
and
before
the
case
got
to
this
court,
congress
changed
section
32
to
include
all
any
corporation
in
which
the
united
states
of
america
is
a
stockholder.
this
court,
speaking
to
mr.
justice
reed
said,
“the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
alleged
defenses
did
not
speak
of
pretenses
of
acting
under
authority
of
corporations
owned
or
controlled
by
the
united
states.”
it
was
passed
in
1884,
six
years
later
than
(inaudible).
it
was
passed
in
1884
before
the
united
states
owned
or
controlled
corporations
operating
hotels,
boat
lines
of
generating
plants.
the
amendments,
subsequent
to
the
occasion
fixed
by
the
indictment,
extended
its
scope
first
to
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
and
later
to
all
corporations
owned
or
controlled
by
the
united
states.
these
legislative
extensions
of
the
scope
of
the
act
were
in
accord
with
the
growing
importance
of
the
administrative
corporation
but
a
comparable
judicial
enlargement
of
a
criminal
act
by
interpretation
is
at
war
with
the
fundamental
concept
of
the
common
law
that
crimes
must
be
defined
with
appropriate
definiteness.
now,
we
say
sir
that
5438,
as
it
existed
in
1878,
cannot
be
extended
by
interpretation.
i
have
already
cited
the
salzman
and
salant
and
the
gilchrist
cases
decided
in
1938,
20
years
ago.
now,
the
rainwater
case
says
that
the
section
5438
should
be
liberally
construed,
and
i
think
there
is
a
little
bit
of
confusion
in
that
decision,
because
while
we
admit
that
3490,
a
civil
remedy
must
be
liberally
construed,
5438,
the
criminal
section,
the
incorporated
statute,
if
you
please,
cannot
be
and
should
not
be
liberally
construed.
now,
the
hess
case
has
been
cited
and
rightly
so,
we
cite
the
hess
case
to
show
that
you
cannot
say
that
5438
has
one
meaning
when
it
is
incorporated
in
the
civil
statute
and
another
meaning
when
you
read
it
as
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
there
amply
shows
that.
he
says,
“true,
5438
is
criminal
and
for
that
reason,
in
interpreting
so
much
of
its
language
as
it
shares
in
common
with
3490,
we
must
give
it
careful
scrutiny
lest
those
be
brought
within
its
reach
who
are
not
clearly
included.”
then
again,
on
page
542
of
the
opinion,
he
says,
"this
qui
tam
policy,
allowing
informers
to
institute
civil
suit
under
section
3490,”
which
incidentally
has
now
been
written
over
the
law,
“cannot
be
used
to
detract
from
the
meaning
of
the
language
in
the
criminal
section
and
we
cannot
say
that
the
same
substantive
language
has
one
meaning
if
criminal
prosecutions
are
brought
by
public
officials
and
quite
a
different
meaning
whether
same
language
is
invoked
civilly
by
an
informant.”
now,
the
hess
case
is
not
the
same
case
as
our
case,
in
the
first
place,
the
hess
case
did
not
involve
a
government
corporation.
the
hess
case
announces
a
rule
of
construction
of
section
3490
and
the
informer
statutes,
if
you
please.
but
we
say,
in
our
case,
you
don't
have
to
construe
it.
why,
because
congress
itself
has
said
what
it
meant
when
dealing
with
a
government
corporation.
we
read
the
--
the
legislative
history,
congress
said
what
it
meant.
the
cases
have
said
that
it
did
not
prior
to
1980,
and
5438
did
not
reach
a
–
this
crime
of
a
false
claim
against
the
government
corporation.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
opinion,
in
the
hess
case,
the
court
deals
with
the
fact
that
in
1863,
which
was
the
time
this
informer's
act
first
started
and
that
federal
aid
to
states
was
known,
it
was
in
the
minds
of
congress
and
it
dwells
on
that.
on
the
other
hand,
i
point
to
the
opinion
in
the
pierce
case,
which
says
in
1884,
six
years
after
our
statute,
the
concept
of
the
government
corporation
was
not
in
the
minds
of
congress
and
it
could
not
be.
now,
–-
mr.
a.
c.
epps
so
far
as
i
know,
i
cannot
answer
that
sir,
i'm
sorry.
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
where
–-
mr.
a.
c.
epps
but
i
know
that
the
cases
in
dealing
with
it
have
said
that
it
does
not
include
a
government
corporation.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
ordinary
meaning
of
the
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
yes
sir.
now,
--
mr.
a.
c.
epps
well,
–-
mr.
a.
c.
epps
no
sir.
i
don't
think
they
thought
they
covered
it,
they
didn't
think
anything
about
it.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
c.
epps
that
is
correct
sir
and
the
instrumentality
in
the
walter
case
has
shown
that
it
was
not
covered
because
mr.
justice
holmes
says
that
in
1918,
they
included
the
instrumentality
of
the
government,
that's
what
they
did
in
1918.
now,
i
have
co-counsel,
i
must
respect
that
time.
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
government
is
now
seeking
a
judicial
amendment
to
an
act
of
congress
and
would
nullify
the
one
act
of
congress
and
would
change
the
meaning
of
another
act
of
congress,
and
finally
that
a
criminal
law
should
not
be
extended
by
implication
and
that
a
crime
should
be
defined
with
appropriate
definiteness.
finally,
we
think
the
government
should
go
to
another
part
of
washington,
namely,
capitol
hill
with
its
argument
and
not
to
this
problem.
thank
you.
