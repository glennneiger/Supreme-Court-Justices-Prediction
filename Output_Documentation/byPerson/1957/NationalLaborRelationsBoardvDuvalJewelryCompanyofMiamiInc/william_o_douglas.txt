justice
william
o.
douglas
is
the
issuance
of
the
meeting
--
procedure
for
issuance
involved
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
all
we
had
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
here,
the
board
and
i
think
it
fills
out
blanks
of
these
and
distributes
them
in
--
in
the
regional
offices.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
od
course
the
(inaudible)
region
administrator
and
if
he
thinks
a
good
cause
has
been
shown
he
grants
them
one,
fills
it
in
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it
unless
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
have
a
petition
to
revoke
and
that's
where
we
are
in
this
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
there's
no
issue
in
the
problem
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
delegation
of
the
--
of
the
power
of
attempt
to
revocation
stage
i
think
that's
what
stage
--
was
that
the
issue
stage,
is
that
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
anything
in
this
legislative
history
if
there
was
any
life
from
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
what's
the
name
of
the
case,
mr.
hamilton?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
that
your
strongest
point
is
to
find
that
the
section
whether
it
was
at
the
board
or
any
of
it
(inaudible)
the
issuance
of
subpoenas
(inaudible)
was
revoked.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
that
--
in
the
representation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
gather
that
your
point
is
that
this
--
this
might
be
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
in
representation?
