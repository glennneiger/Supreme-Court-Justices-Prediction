mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
--
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
review
of
the
judgment
of
that
court
in
denying
enforcement
of
certain
subpoenas
duces
tecum
issued
in
the
course
of
a
representation
proceeding
under
the
section
9
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
section
11
(1)
of
the
act
provides
that
the
board
shall
issue
subpoenas
forthwith
upon
the
application
of
any
party
to
the
proceeding.
the
section
further
provides
that
the
person
subpoenaed
may
contest
the
validity
of
the
subpoena
by
filing
a
petition
to
revoke
with
the
board.
and
the
board
shall
revoke
the
subpoena
if
in
its
opinion
the
evidence
sought
is
irrelevant
to
the
subpoena,
does
not
describe
it
with
sufficient
particularity.
now,
by
regulation,
the
board
has
provided
that
whereas
here,
a
subpoena
is
returnable
at
a
hearing,
the
petition
to
revoke
shall
be
filed
with
and
ruled
on
in
the
first
instance
by
the
hearing
officer.
his
ruling
is
in
turn
subject
to
review
by
the
board
itself
under
a
special
appeal
procedure
which
i
will
describe
in
detail
later.
the
question
presented
is
whether
this
board
regulation
is
authorized
by
the
statute
or
a
stated
otherwise,
thus
section
11
(1)
require
the
board
alone
to
rule
on
petitions
to
revoke
subpoenas
or
may
the
board
authorize
the
hearing
officer
to
make
the
initial
ruling
on
such
petition
pursuant
to
this
procedure.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
a
special
appeal
procedure
whereby
the
party
under
the
board's
rules
can
request
the
board
for
permission
to
appeal
specially
at
that
stage.
the
party
makes
out
the
--
the
case
that
he
has
for
offsetting
the
hearing
officer
and
that
question
goes
to
the
board
and
if
the
board
determines
that
a
substantial
question
is
presented
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
hearing
officer's
ruling,
it
will
grant
the
special
appeal,
consider
the
subpoena
question
and
upset
the
hearing
officer
if
need
be.
there
are
situations
where
the
board
has
revoked
subpoenas
pursuant
to
this
procedure.
we
have
reproduced
several
such
orders
in
the
appendix
to
our
--
our
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
didn't
get
your
question.
mr.
norton
j.
come
a
non-party
in
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
the
non
--
the
--
the
non-party
could
petition
to
revoke
the
subpoena
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
as
i
understand
it.
now,
the
same
question
is
--
is
presented
in
the
case
which
follows.
however,
there,
the
subpoenas
were
issued
in
connection
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
and
we
believe
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
furnishes
an
additional
source
or
authority
for
the
board's
procedure
in
such
proceedings.
now,
briefly
here,
the
underlying
facts
are
these.
in
november
of
1955,
a
union,
the
retail
clerks
filed
the
petition
with
the
board's
regional
office
for
a
representation
election
among
the
employees
at
a
retail
jewelry
store
in
miami,
florida.
at
the
hearing,
the
employer
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
business
of
the
store
did
not
satisfy
the
board's
jurisdictional
yardsticks
for
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction.
however,
the
store
refused
to
furnish
any
information
to
substantiate
that
contention
whereupon
the
hearing
was
adjourned
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
information
by
subpoenas.
five
subpoenas
deces
tecum
and
one
testimonial
subpoena,
the
validity
of
which
is
not
an
issue
here,
were,
thereupon,
issued
and
served.
they
were
issued
to
the
store
where
the
union
was
claiming
representation
rights
and
to
three
other
stores
allegedly
part
of
the
same
intrastate
chain,
because
under
the
board's
jurisdictional
yardsticks,
jurisdiction
will
be
asserted
over
an
intrastate
retail
store
if
its
out
of
state
purchases
meet
a
certain
figure
and
even
if
the
purchases
of
the
particular
store
do
not
satisfy
the
standard
if
the
store
is
part
of
a
chain
and
the
total
purchases
of
the
stores
is
in
the
chain
meet
the
figure
then
jurisdiction
will
be
asserted.
so
that
the
subpoenas
here
requested,
merely,
sufficient
information
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
board's
chain
store
standard
was
met.
they
were
issued
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
similar
to
that
followed
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
that
is,
the
board
attorney
assigned
to
the
case
made
application
to
the
regional
director
setting
forth
the
person
to
be
subpoenaed
and
the
information
sought
and
the
regional
director
issued
the
attorney
blank
subpoenas
bearing
the
seal
of
the
board
and
the
facsimile
signature
of
a
board
member
and
were
filled-in
by
the
attorney
and
served.
now,
upon
service
of
the
subpoenas,
the
respondents
filed
petitions
to
revoke
the
subpoena
alleging
that
they
were
burdensome
and
has
not
been
properly
issued
which
petitions
were
addressed
to
and
filed
with
the
board
in
washington.
and
copies
were
sent
to
the
hearing
officer
in
miami.
the
executive
secretary
of
the
board
returned
the
petitions
calling
respondents'
attention
to
the
provision
of
the
board's
rules
herein
issue
which
requires
that
these
petitions
be
filed
with
the
hearing
officer.
the
hearing
officer
then
fixed
a
date
for
respondents
to
file
briefs
and
argue
orally
in
support
of
the
petitions
which
respondents
declined
to
avail
themselves
of
and
the
hearing
officer
proceeded
to
deny
the
petitions
to
revoke
on
the
ground
that
they
presented
no
substantial
issue
as
to
the
validity
of
the
subpoenas.
and
when
the
hearing
was
reconvened,
respondents
appeared
through
counsel
and
indicated
they
would
not
comply
with
the
subpoenas,
whereupon,
pursuant
to
section
11
(2)
of
the
act
the
board
then
instituted
proceedings
to
enforce
the
subpoenas
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
enforcement
of
the
subpoenas
on
the
ground
that
they
were
unreasonable
and
oppressive
and
were
invalidly
issued
and
that
the
regional
director
was
not
a
party
to
the
proceeding
entitled
to
utilize
the
subpoenas.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
agreed
that
the
subpoena
should
not
be
enforced
but
for
a
different
reason.
the
court
was
of
the
views
that
this
board
procedure
or
ruling
on
this
petition
to
revoke
in
the
first
instance
by
the
hearing
officer,
constituted
an
unauthorized
delegation
of
authority
to
the
hearing
officer.
and
since
the
board
itself
had
not
passed
on
respondents'
petitions
to
revoke,
the
suit
in
the
court's
view
was
thus
premature
and
could
not
be
maintained.
now,
the
board's
position
is
a
two-fold.
we
believe,
first
of
all,
that
properly
understood,
the
board's
procedure
for
revocation
of
subpoenas
does
not
present
a
delegation
problem
at
all
and
that
the
board
itself
retains
the
power
of
final
decision
through
this
appeal
procedure
which
i've
indicated
at
the
outset.
in
the
alternative,
however,
we
submit
that
even
if
the
board's
procedure
were
viewed
as
entailing
a
delegation
of
board
authority
with
the
hearing
officer,
the
act
does
not
preclude
such
delegation.
now,
i've
indicated
briefly
that
under
this
procedure,
the
board
requires
that
the
petition
to
revoke
first
be
filed
with
the
hearing
officer.
now,
in
an
unfair
labor
practice,
this
hearing
officer
is
a
trial
examiner
with
the
independent
status
conferred
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that's
the
situation
in
the
case
which
follows.
in
a
representation
case,
such
as
we
have
here,
he
is
a
field
examiner
or
attorney
under
staff
of
the
regional
office.
the
reason
for
the
difference
is
that
a
representation
case
is
essentially
an
investigation
and
not
--
not
necessary
a
type
of
proceeding
and
is
exempt
from
the
hearing
requirements
of
the
apa.
in
such
cases,
the
board
is
thus
free,
not
restricted
to
the
panel
of
hearing
officers
setup
under
that
act
and
can
utilize
other
qualified
personnel
for
the
hearing
officer
function.
however,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
hearing
officer
in
the
--
our
case
does
not
make
recommendations
to
the
board.
his
function
at
the
hearing
is
otherwise
is
responsible
as
that
of
a
trial
examiner
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
he
may
call
on
and
examine
witnesses,
rule
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
regulate
the
course
of
the
hearing
and
ensure
that
it's
his
job
to
see
that
a
full
and
complete
record
is
developed
for
the
board.
now,
if
a
party
is
dissatisfied
with
the
hearing
officer's
action
on
the
petition
to
revoke,
the
board's
procedure
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset
affords
the
party
an
opportunity
to
apply
to
the
board
for
permission
to
appeal
specially
and
if
a
substantial
question
is
presented,
the
board
will
entertain
the
appeal.
moreover,
there
is
opportunity
when
the
case
is
before
the
board
for
final
decision
to
obtain
board
review
of
the
subpoena
question.
now,
of
course,
that
does
not
afford
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
situation
where
the
hearing
officer
has
denied
the
petition
to
revoke
but
where
he
grants
a
petition
to
revoke
the
subpoena.
and
the
party
aggrieved
is
the
person
requesting
the
subpoena.
he
is
afforded
an
opportunity
to
obtain
board
review
in
regress
of
that
situation
when
the
case
comes
before
the
board
for
final
decision
because
the
board
can
as
it
has
in
such
cases
ordered
the
hearing
reopened
should
it
find
that
the
evidence
denied
to
the
individual
was
material.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
not
too
sure
that
i
--
pursuant
to
subpoena
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
where
the
--
where
the
subpoena
is
not
quashed,
the
opportunity
is
afforded
under
the
special
appeal
procedure
for
the
individual
to
have
the
board
quash
the
subpoena
before
the
subpoena
is
enforced.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
i
should
point
out
that
the
board
has
utilized
this
procedure
of
having
the
hearing
officer
make
the
initial
ruling
on
the
validity
of
the
propriety
of
the
subpoena
subject
to
review
by
the
board
itself
since
the
earliest
wagner
act
days.
under
the
wagner
act,
however,
the
subpoena
procedure
was
a
one-step
one
rather
than
a
two-step
one
and
the
decisional
judgement
was
exercised
at
the
stage
of
determining
whether
the
subpoena
should
issue.
whereas,
under
taft-hartley,
the
issuance
is
automatic
and
the
judgment
is
deferred
to
the
petition
to
revoke
stage.
but
apart
from
that
difference,
the
board's
rules,
since
the
earliest
wagner
act
days,
provided
for
the
same
method
of
having
the
hearing
officer
initially
rule
on
the
propriety
of
the
subpoena.
and
these
practical
considerations
explain
this
procedure.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
we
get
enforcement
on
the
subpoena.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
board's
subpoenas
are
not
self-enforced
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
before
the
hearing
officer.
the
respondent
did
not
elect
to
request
permission
for
a
special
appeal
after
the
hearing
officer
denied
his
petition
to
revoke.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
that
they're
broken
down
insofar
as
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
could
become
a
serious
problem.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
could
become
a
serious
problem
in
terms
of
the
number
of
enforcement
cases
that
we've
had,
i'd
say
that
they've
averaged
probably
five
or
ten
year
or
more,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
but
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it's
indicative
to
the
fact
that
the
parties
have
generally
been
satisfied
with
the
way
this
procedure
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
are
no
statistics
in
the
reports
of
the
board
your
honor.
i
have
attempted
to
ascertain
some
statistics
for
our
regional
offices
and
i
find
that
--
and
they
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
information
i
was
referring
to
was
set
forth
at
page
36
of
our
--
of
our
brief.
it
shows
that
in
a
recent
fiscal
year
of
period,
there
were
total
of
about
218
subpoenas,
duces
tecum
issued
in
a
--
in
connection
with
representation
cases
and
roughly,
petitions
to
revoke
or
file
in
about
20%
of
those
cases.
now,
potentially,
everyone
of
those
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
a
--
the
fiscal
year
ending
june
30th,
1956.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
--
that
is
correct.
now,
however,
in
a
representation
case
as
the
court
is
aware,
it
is
extremely
urgent
to
proceed
expeditiously
and
hold
the
election
promptly
because
of
the
danger
of
strikes.
if
the
parties
had
a
procedure
open
to
them
whereby
they
could
come
shooting
into
the
board
in
everyone
of
these
subpoena
cases,
potentially,
there's
no
way
of
telling
how
many
the
board
would
get.
and
when
the
board
would
get
them
originally
as
distinguished
from
through
the
special
appeals
procedure,
the
hearings
could
be
delayed
a
substantial
period
of
time.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
parties
though,
over
the
years
have
appreciated
that
under
this
procedure,
the
board
will
not
entertain
an
--
an
appeal
unless
there's
a
substantial
question
presented
as
to
the
hearing
officer's
ruling.
now,
if
you
wipe
out
the
hearing
officer
and
they
come
in,
in
every
case,
they
don't
have
to
make
that
showing
and
it
also
even
assuming
they're
acting
in
good
faith
does
put
an
additional
burden
on
the
board
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we've
been
pretty
careful
in
our
use
of
subpoenas
so
that
at
least
recently,
that
has
not
been
a
common
complaint.
it's
usually
irrelevance.
it
doesn't
pertain
to
--
to
any
matter,
an
issue
or
privilege
information
they
sought.
they
generally
fall
in
that
--
in
that
category.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
is
accurate.
however,
in
the
situation
where
a
substantial
case
is
made
up,
the
board
has
to
revoke
subpoenas.
we've
reproduced
several
such
orders
that
go
back
over
--
over
a
period
of
time.
it
just
depends
upon
what
the
--
what
the
problem
is.
if
--
if
this
--
if
the
hearing
officer
has
--
has
gone
off
base,
there's
an
opportunity
there
for
getting
the
board
to
--
to
reverse
them
promptly.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
--
i'm
not
your
honor.
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
is
happening
under
--
under
cudahy.
now,
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
--
no.
i
mean
how
--
how
the
wage
in
our
administration
has
--
has
spared.
i
strongly
suspect
that
they've
managed
to
--
to
get
along
all
right
because
i
don't
recall
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
it
had
been
amended
since
cudahy.
however,
i
think
they've
got
a
--
a
little
different
problem
from
the
kind
that
we've
got
here
particularly
with
our
representation
cases
or
the
need
for
speed
in
holding
the
election
as
extremely
necessary
and
a
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
because
he's
--
he's
on
the
--
on
the
spot.
he's
been
holding
the
hearing.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
they
do.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
all
that
you
had
in
cudahy
except
that
issuance
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
you
get
a
petition
to
revoke.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that's
where
we
are
in
this
case.
however,
i
think
that
the
procedure
for
issuance
under
cudahy
was
not
automatic
so
that
you
had
an
element
of
the
decisional
judgment
involved
at
the
issuance
stage
in
cudahy
that
you
have
all
channeled
into
the
petition
to
revoke
stage
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
there
is
no
issue
in
this
problem.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
that
was
the
ground
of
the
district
court.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
of
appeals
put
it
solely
on
the
delegation
of
the
petition
to
revoke
function.
now,
and
as
i've
indicated,
our
first
position
is
that
we
don't
have
a
delegation
problem.
we've
got
a
practical
procedure
for
using
assistance
in
discharge
of
a
board
function
similar
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
--
well
delegation,
of
course,
is
a
matter
of
--
of
degree
as
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
isn't
the
kind
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
well,
that
is
correct
but
what
i
meant
by
saying
that
it
wasn't
a
delegation
problem,
it
wasn't
--
it
isn't
a
situation
where
the
board
has
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
divested
itself
of
responsibility
for
the
support
in
its
action
which
is
what
you
had
in
cudahy
and
in
mohawk
because
there
was
no
provision
there
for
any
review
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
a
control
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
with
--
although
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
--
that
is
correct.
i
--
i
think
that
judge
reeves
did
not
fully
appreciate
perhaps
the
extent
to
which
the
board
had
reserved
a
--
a
control
here.
he
--
he
viewed
it
as
simply
a
question
of
whether
the
board's
power
was
original
or
--
or
appellate
under
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
are
things
in
the
legislative
history
which
hurt
us
and
there
are
things
which
--
which
help
us.
and
i
intended
to
--
to
get
to
that
now
and
if
i
do
not
have
sufficient
time
i'll
finish
it
in
the
--
in
the
next
case.
the
two
things
that
looked
against
delegation
if
this
were
completely
a
--
a
situation
where
the
board
hadn't
reserved
an
open
call
are
that
section
11
(1)
and
this
is
what
judge
reeves
emphasized,
draws
a
distinction
between
the
subpoena
power
and
the
power
to
inspect
and
copy
evidence
and
the
power
to
administer
oaths.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
that
in
speaking
about
the
subpoena
power
section
11
(1)
says
the
board
whereas
in
speaking
about
the
power
to
inspect
and
the
power
to
copy,
it
talks
about
the
board
or
its
agents.
now,
if
you
stop
there,
i
recognize
that
we
have
a
difficult
world
to
hold.
however,
as
mohawk
shows,
the
answer
as
to
whether
congress
intended
the
subpoena
power
to
be
delegated,
depends
upon
the
statute
as
a
whole.
and
we
believe
that
on
examining
the
other
facts
which
are
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
they
over
balance
the
impression
that
you
would
get
from
just
looking
at
section
11
(1)
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
sir?
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
ask
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
is,
your
honor,
and
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
require
anything
more.
i
think
that
the
board,
although
this
appeal
is
denominated
a
discretionary
appeal
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
grantee
of
appeal
does
look
for
what
the
hearing
officer
has
done
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
substantial
claim
of
impropriety.
and
that
it's
not
a
situation
where
the
party
is
given
--
given
the
brush-off.
when
a
serious
problem
is
presented,
an
opportunity
is
--
is
available
for
a
board
redress
before
the
--
the
action
has
involved.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
and
as
i
tried
to
point
out
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
it
has
worked
this
way
so
long.
i
think
that
we
can
fairly
speculate,
though
as
to
what
would
happen,
given
the
volatile
nature
of
a
representation
case
and
its
widespread
occurrences
throughout
the
country.
what
would
happen
if
every
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
--
that
is
correct
but
as
i
intend
to
show
later
and
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
congress,
it
could
fairly
be
said
was
aware
of
the
way
the
board
has
been
utilizing
its
procedure
through
the
years,
because
the
attorney
general's
administrative
committee
made
reference
to
how
this
worked
under
the
wagner
act.
now,
its
report
was
published
to
the
senate
document.
this
has
been
in
the
board's
rules
since
as
far
a
back
as
1939
and
in
taft-hartley,
when
congress
got
around
to
amending
the
act,
it
looked
at
the
subpoena
provision.
and
although
there
is
no
indication
that
it
discussed
this
particular
problem,
it
--
for
the
house
bill
proposed
to
make
some
changes
in
the
sense
of
depriving
the
board
of
the
use
of
subpoenas
prior
to
hearings
in
unfair
labor
practice
and
appoints
cases.
and
they
provided
for
this
step
procedure
and
then
when
the
--
the
senate
bill
proposed
no
change
in
the
wagner
act
language
and
then
when
it
emerged
from
conference,
the
only
thing
that
they
did
was
to
adopt
the
petition
to
revoke
a
procedure,
the
house
bill
rejecting
the
elimination
of
the
use
of
subpoenas
prior
to
hearing
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
and
senator
taft
said,
the
only
change
that
we're
making
in
existing
law,
insofar
as
subpoenas
are
concerned
is
to
convert
it
from
a
one-step
into
a
two-step
procedure.
now,
granted
that
you
don't
have
a
specific
dealing
with
--
with
this
--
this
problem,
we
certainly
do
have
a
situation
where
congress
was
looking
into
the
board's
subpoena
procedures
and
the
only
thing
that
they
emerged
with
is
a
change
which
would
convert
it
from
a
one-step
into
a
two-step
procedure.
so,
we
think
that
in
--
in
the
face
of
that,
we
have
to
a
degree
at
least
a
legislative
ratification
on
the
board's
subpoena
procedure.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
not
until
taft-hartley
as
nearly
as
i
can
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
until
after
taft-hartley.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
your
honor's
statement
is
certainly
more
advisory.
