justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
can
a
non-party
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
non-party
witness
the
subpoena.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
court's
subpoenas
issued
against
people
are
not
parties
for
the
proceeding
doesn't
--
don't
stay
on
occasion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
come,
tell
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
mean
that
to
gather
the
motion
to
quash
in
the
first
instance
is
made
before
the
hearing
officer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
denied
it.
and
i
understand
an
application
may
be
made
for
what
you
call
question
appeal
and
got
from
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
whether
or
not
that
appeal
will
be
entertained
as
i
gather
a
matter
of
the
board's
discretion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
that's
denied
and
then
i
gather
the
witness
must
produce
subpoena,
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
then
you
to
go
into
the
court
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
so
that
if
it's
denied,
still
an
opportunity
with
the
district
court
can
exist,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
a
board
initiated
proceedings
were
enforced
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
instance,
there
actually
was
a
hearing,
was
it
filed
--
it
was
before
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
think
the
board's
regulations
for
example
cover
this
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
regulations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
provision
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
and
are
you
suggesting
--
was
there
any
evidence
of
the
abuse
that
you've
described
namely,
of
--
it
couldn't
have
been
the
court
until
this
provision
got
under
taft-hartley
act
as
i
get
it.
but
you
should
now
describe
for
us
is
that
the
hearers
understand
that
they
have
no
choice
but
to
issue
the
subpoena
upon
request
but
promptly
they
revoke
it
so
that
the
requirement
that
they
issue
it
becomes
meaningless
and
the
requirement
as
you
see
it
under
11
(1),
that
the
issue
of
revocation
will
be
determined
only
by
the
board
as
they
come
in.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
prior
you
say,
prior
to
taft-hartley,
the
practice
was,
in
the
first
place,
the
examiner
would
or
would
not
issue
the
subpoena
as
you
saw
fit,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
secondly,
if
he
did
issue
it,
he
might
also
revoke
it,
is
that
it?
prior
to
taft-hartley?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
once
it
was
issued,
that
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
--
then
what
--
what
--
what
could
a
party
do?
would
they
have
to
obey
the
subpoena
or
would
--
could
they
await
an
the
enforcement
proceeding
then?
