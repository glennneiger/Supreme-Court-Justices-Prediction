justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
what
are
those
statistics
of
this
--
the
incidents
of
what
greater
(inaudible)
how
often
are
these
appeals
contested?
are
these
--
not
a
relevance
when
you
(inaudible)
how
often
is
--
is
there
a
contest
to
the
subpoena.
any
--
any
statistics
in
the
report
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
man
instituted
this
problem?
is
this
a
serious
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
board
hasn't
one
the
holdings
sleeping
all
these
years
so
that
there's
likely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
create
an
activity
in
the
past
and
then
that
there
has
been.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
often
the
board
is
called
upon,
how
often
they're
--
they're
challenged
under
the
present
procedure
how
often
the
views
are
taken
to
the
board.
is
it
not
--
as
this
is
an
administrative
problem
in
part
setting,
you
are
arguing
or
will
argue
that
this
is
why
it's
ineffective
which
makes
for
the
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
the
congress
with
due
regard
to
those
rights
that
should
be
safeguarded
in
individuals,
isn't
that
the
substance
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
as
bearing
on
that,
one
wants
to
know
what
the
nature
of
this
limited
problem
is.
how
often
does
this
come
up?
are
there
any
statistics
in
the
reports
of
the
board
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
short,
if
this
comes
up
--
if
the
board
is
called
upon
independent
in
lieu,
there's
only
x
number
of
times
and
x
is
twelve
a
year
or
five
a
year
its
one
problem.
if
this
arrived
as
two
hundred
times
a
year,
it's
another
problem.
i
don't
know
which
way
it
looked
because
the
frequency
of
it,
the
dissatisfaction
with
the
subpoena
that's
issued
may
prove
the
opposite
thing.
it
may
either
prove
you
shouldn't
put
that
burden
on
the
board
in
the
first
instance
or
it
may
prove
that
so
it's
serious
that
it
should
be
put
on
the
board.
i
don't
know
which
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
period
over
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
there
are
40
motions
for
revocations
filed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
because
--
because
an
attack
against
the
subpoena
is
made
for
dilatory
purposes,
the
delaying
purposes
but
because
of
the
burden
on
the
board,
because
if
--
if
delay
is
a
danger,
then
there's
great
opportunity
for
delay
of
having
first
the
examiner
and
then
an
appeal
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
they'd
want
to
have
a
full
hearing,
lawyers
and
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
maybe
opinion
writing
would
begin.
what
is
the
ground
of
attack
on
the
scheme
of
motion
and
here
is
extensiveness
--
undue
extensiveness
of
the
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
suggesting
that
most
of
them
are
turned
down?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
in
a
position
to
--
you've
had
to
say
what
has
happened
to
all
these
prophesies
of
dire
evil
that
cudahy
they're
supposed
to
usher
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
happening
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
what
you've
said
that
the
examiner
dispatches
the
complaint
against
the
subpoena
promptly
that
the
--
there's
a
quick
disposition
of
these
motions
to
revoke?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
not
the
problem
that
that's
--
if
you
had
to
go
to
the
board,
if
--
if
you
sent
them
out
here
as
against
the
scattered
authority
of
the
examiners,
they
sit
all
over
the
united
states,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
must
say
that
i
don't
understand
that.
the
--
the
whole
point
of
judge
reeves
was
that
the
statute
says
the
board
may
and
the
board
means
the
board,
and
you
pass
it
on
to
somebody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
delegation
usually
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
now
questioning
the
merits
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
there's
a
delegation
problem,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
10
years,
a
controlled
delegation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
call
to
reserve
your
right
to
pass
on
it
and
therefore
it's
merely
--
i
mean
somebody
helped
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
judge
reeves
(inaudible)
that
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
whether
i
have
to
do
it
or
whether
i'll
let
somebody
else
do
it
was
merely
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
24
hours
in
a
day
on
the
whole
that
these
appellants
are
going
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
he's
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
powers
of
the
board
itself
and
the
power
to
these
agents
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
evidence
that
congress
at
all
thought
about
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
the
word,
that
it
used
the
word,
the
board
may?
is
there
any
evidence,
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other,
that
the
board,
if
the
congress
had
in
mind
the
difference
between
a
divestment
of
authority
and
a
retention
of
positive
delegated
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
why
do
we
fuss
around
finding
out
what
congress
intended?
that's
the
crucial
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
you
have
to
argue
without
pushing
the
argument
too
far
is
that
you
have
here
administrative
practice
of
30
years
when
it
had
begun
to
be
challenged
in
the
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
after
tart-hartley?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
better
the
opposition.
you
have
an
administrative
practice
not
challenging
this
court
that
in
itself
is
alleging
the
argument,
the
respondents
can
deal
with
it
(inaudible)
an
administrative
fact
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress,
not
nearly
(inaudible)
to
deny
the
attention
(inaudible)
but
they
were
aware
of
it.
they
can't
do
anything
about
to
relate
the
date
to
what
statute
the
system
that
isn't
obvious,
it's
merely
argumentatively
in
question
to
the
statute,
why
do
we
have
that
is
the
case
and
all
the
other
things
weren't
just
necessary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
make
a
final
report
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
that
means
that
they
pass
judgment.
that
involves
judgment,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
is
the
report
merely
(inaudible)
and
merely
a
summary
of
the
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
no
--
and
no
characterization
or
no
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
highly
intelligent
ibm
machine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
perhaps
i
shouldn't
say
that
in
--
of
--
in
fairness
to
the
ibm
machine.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
intervene
in
the
discussion
between
you
and
my
brother
whittaker.
what
--
that
the
system
that
you're
attacking
doesn't
make
of
the
hearing
agent
--
officer
merely
a
conduit
for
transmission
of
the
objection
that's
put
to
him.
he
really
passes
it
on
it
and
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this
examination,
there
must
be
affirmative
steps
of
an
appeal
date,
is
that
right?
so
that
he
isn't
merely
a
--
a
secretary,
or
a
clerk,
were
to
summarize
under
the
present
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
don't
care
what
the
board
is
trying
to
make.
the
existing
system
implies
--
not
implies,
under
the
existing
system,
motion
for
revocation
is
made
to
him
and
he
revokes
or
doesn't
revoke,
he
--
deny
--
a
motion
denied
and
that
does
not
automatically
go
up
to
the
board
but
it
can
go
up
only
by
way
of
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
he
isn't
on
the
assumption
of
the
question.
he
isn't
just
a
fellow
who
helps
the
board
to
decide.
he
decides
but
the
board
may
pull
it
back,
is
that
right?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
present
scheme
is
that
he
decide
what
if
you
want
to
get
a
review
of
it
then
you
appeal
like
any
other
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
they
said
we
wouldn't
hear
the
appeal
or
turned
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
they
decided
against
your
wish
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
wasn't
(inaudible).
as
i
understand
you
to
say
the
--
wasn't
until
(inaudible)
that
the
specific
provision
regarding
revocation
came
into
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
you've
further
to
say
that
therefore,
the
proceeding
prior
to
that
can't
have
the
weight
of
continuing
administrative
practice
because
there
wasn't
any,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
congress
changed
it.
now,
were
there
no
--
under
the
old
--
under
--
prior
to
tart-hartley,
subpoenas
were
issued,
and
the
way
which
they've
been
issued
and
where
there
are
no
protests
or
there
are
no
motions
for
revocation
before
the
administrative
authority,
other
than
the
cases
that
came
into
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
happened
in
between
--
was
it
1936
and
1935
and
1947.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
one
--
one
may
draw
some
inferences,
i
don't
know
how
valid.
one,
that
--
that
things
were
going
the
way
things
should
go
mostly
in
a
--
a
sensible,
easy
way.
officials
discharged
their
responsibilities.
lawyers
were
reasonably,
as
they
seem
to
be,
if
i
may
say
so,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
so,
that
isn't
a
terrible
problem
one
way
or
the
other,
which
i
suspected
is
construed.
what's
all
the
excitement
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
with
you.
if
congress
had
something,
it's
not
for
me
to
say
they
shouldn't
have
said
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
your
self-restraint
if
that's
what
it
is.
if
you
don't
say
it
with
--
the
--
the
cudahy
case
is
on
the
books,
congress
presumably
knew
all
about
it,
more
than
half
of
the
members
of
it,
two-thirds
of
the
members
of
congress
have
voted
therefore,
they
read
our
opinions
usually
with
great
care
and
understanding
and
therefore
they
knew
about
cudahy
and
applied,
they
adopted
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
also
going
to
argue
that
it
seems
the
statute
says
the
board
or
members
thereof
that
they
had
in
mind
not
to
put
too
heavy
a
burden
on
the
board
of
the
collectivity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
all
those
acts
had
specific
meaning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
all
those
--
were
those
provisions
in
the
original
act
or
did
they
come
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
came
after
cudahy
is
i
think.
i'm
not
sure.
