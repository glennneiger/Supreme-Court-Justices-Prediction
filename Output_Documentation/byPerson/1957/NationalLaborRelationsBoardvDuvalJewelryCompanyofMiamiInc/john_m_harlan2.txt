justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
in
part
of
the
deal,
they
decided
that
the
subpoena
was
bad
because
it's
having
an
issue
problem,
am
i
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
--
that
was
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals'
holding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
that
justice
frankfurter
raised
is
very
important.
really
the
essence
in
your
position
is
that
administratively
to
construe
the
subpoena
power
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
going
to
make
it
difficult
for
the
board
to
operate
and
yet
we've
got
no
figures
here
as
to
the
magnitude
of
this
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
you
might
have
to
go
to
congress
about
it.
they
would
carry
it
out
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
shouldn't
the
board
have
the
assistance,
mechanical
assistance
if
you
(inaudible)
as
an
examiner
or
sit
through
the
--
this
voluminous
stuff
and
then
come
up
with
a
report
that's
going
to
list
them
on
the
burden
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
things
in
the
board.
i
know
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
prevailed
on
the
--
all
these
things
have
to
go
to
the
board,
that
the
board
under
the
statute
say
well,
except
in
the
unusual
case,
we
are
not
going
to
review
the
subpoenas
except
on
final
--
final
hearing,
we'll
postpone
the
final
one.
justice
john
m.
harlan
review
until
the
case
comes
up
to
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
my
question
was,
supposing
you
forget
about
the
trial
examiner,
take
him
out
of
the
picture
and
then
the
board
said,
as
they
have
said
to
you
in
this
letter,
where
you
don't
think
that
this
is
important
to
review
at
this
stage,
we'll
defer
it
until
the
matter
is
right.
did
they
have
that
authority
under
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
they
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that
under
the
statute
if
you
eliminate
the
examiner's
step
in
this
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
this
matter
is
affected
at
all
by
the
fact
that
before
the
subpoena
can
be
enforced,
the
district
court
has
to
take
a
look
at
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
danger
of
contempt
here
or
anything
of
that
kind?
as
there
would
--
might
be
in
a
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
the
ordinary
subpoena.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
like
cruelty
and
under
cruelty.
