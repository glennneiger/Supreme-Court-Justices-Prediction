mr.
theo
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honor.
it
might
be
well
to
take
just
a
moment
to
fill
in
some
things
in
the
beginning
of
this
case.
the
national
labor
relations
board
entertained
their
petition
against
one
corporation
in
miami
of
a
chain
of
intrastate
stores.
this
corporation
appeared
at
the
hearing.
it
filed
as
a
counsel
for
the
board
has
stated
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it
filed
also
with
that
a
sworn
affidavit
setting
up
in
full
the
business
of
that
corporation
and
showing
that
that
corporation
was
not
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
board's
jurisdiction
as
it
was
then
fixed.
the
board
then
went
out
and
brought
in
three
or
four
corporations,
whose
employees
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
in
order
to
attempt
to
prove
jurisdiction.
then
the
subpoenas
were
issued.
and
those
subpoenas
require
that
these
corporations
bring
for
an
entire
year
all
of
their
records
into
the
hearing,
covering
every
sale
and
every
purchase
between
the
corporations
for
an
entire
year
in
other
words,
the
complete
business
of
the
corporations
for
a
year.
in
the
answer
in
the
district
court,
the
respondents
stated
and
it
has
never
been
contradicted
that
it
would
have
taken
at
least
eight
weeks
to
get
this
data
up
for
the
board.
consequently,
the
corporation
refused
to
abide
by
the
subpoenas.
one
of
the
principal
reasons
was
that
they
were
oppressed
--
oppressing
the
non-reasonable
and
the
district
court
so
held.
there
was
some
statement
made
with
the
hearing
officer
offered
to
permit
counsel
to
--
to
have
oral
argument
and
to
file
a
brief.
that's
true.
but
the
position
of
the
respondents
has
always
been
that
the
hearing
officer
had
no
authority
to
either
hear
or
rule
upon
those
petitions
to
revoke.
we
had
asked
the
board
itself
for
our
argument
and
the
opportunity
to
file
a
brief,
and
the
board
refused
to
permit
that.
the
board
merely
sent
our
petition
back
and
attempted
to
force
us
to
hand
it
through
the
hearing
officer.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
like
for
the
court
to
remember
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
representation
case,
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
there's
an
innate
and
fundamental
difference
between
these
two
types
of
cases.
generally
speaking,
representation
cases
and
hearing
officers
whose
authority
is
in
question
here
are
not
covered
by
the
administrative
procedures
act
at
all.
hearing
officers
are
called
trial
examiners
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases
and
they
are
covered
by
the
administrative
procedures
act.
another
thing
to
remember
is
that
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
issuance
of
subpoenas.
we're
concerned
with
a
much
more
important
problem,
the
revocation
of
subpoenas.
there
has
been
some
question
about
what
might
happen
hypothetically
in
the
future,
where
this
court
through
the
hearing
officers
had
no
authority
to
revoke
subpoenas.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
first
court
that
made
a
decision
along
these
lines
was
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
versus
pesante
case
which
was
decided
in
1954
by
the
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
california.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there's
been
very
much
disruption
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
procedures,
although
that
case
was
entirely
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
the
very
issues
that
are
concerned
here
and
it
was
not
appealed.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i'm
sorry.
mr.
theo
hamilton
national
labor
relations
board
versus
pesante.
it's
cited
in
the
brief
for
the
respondents.
the
board
has
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
wording
of
the
act
is
that
you
say
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
features
but
i'm
going
to
point
out
to
the
court
what
happened
in
congress
prior
to
the
time
this
act
was
passed,
which
has
a
direct
bearing
on
it.
i
need
not
tell
this
court
anything
about
the
importance
of
subpoena
power
merely
mention
the
fact
that
the
subpoena
power
is
one
of
the
most
important,
one
of
the
most
delicate,
one
which
involves
the
most
intricate
problems
of
constitutional
statutory
law.
and
we
have
that
involved
here,
where
a
hearing
officer
tried
to
issue
a
subpoena
requiring
a
private
citizen
to
produce
his
books
and
records
for
a
period,
in
this
case,
of
an
entire
year.
the
source
of
all
subpoena
power
in
a
hearing
officer
arises
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
i
want
to
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
this
section
was
changed
into
material
particulars
in
the
taft-hartley
law.
mr.
theo
hamilton
yes,
sir.
in
the
wagner
act,
there
was
no
provision
for
revocation
of
subpoenas.
it
was
not
mentioned
and
the
act
did
not
require
the
mandatory
issuance
of
subpoenas.
now,
those
two
factors
were
introduced
by
congress
and
congress
presumably
knew
at
that
time
what
the
practice
of
the
board
was,
and
yet
congress
changed
that
act
in
two
material
particulars,
each
of
which
materially
changed
the
handling
of
subpoenas,
not
only
the
issuance
but
the
revocation
of
subpoenas.
the
act
has
passed
this,
the
court
knows
in
1947.
administrative
practice
prior
to
that
time,
i
would
say
has
no
bearing
on
this
because
congress
knew
what
the
board
was
doing
and
changed
it
in
these
two
material
particulars.
mr.
theo
hamilton
11
(1)
was
the
act
--
was
the
section
of
the
act
when
it
is
changed.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
believe
it
is,
sir.
i'm
not
positive
of
that.
there's
certainly
a
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
--
quotation
there.
as
i
said,
the
entire
source
of
authority
for
the
powers
of
a
hearing
officer
in
reference
to
subpoenas
must
be
contained
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
not
have
the
authority
under
the
act
to
issue
or
promulgate
a
rule
by
which
it
can
delegate
power
to
revoke
a
subpoena
to
a
hearing
officer,
whether
it's
in
the
initial
instance
or
in
the
final
instance.
the
act
itself
clearly
states
that
petitions
for
revocation
shall
be
referred
to
the
board
and
it
has
no
language
such
as
it
has
in
many
other
instances
of
the
board
handling
administrative
matters
through
its
agents.
the
fundamental
issue
is
whether
a
hearing
officer
in
a
representation
case
has
authority
to
rule
upon
revocation
of
subpoenas.
as
we
see
it,
the
--
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
the
board's
rules
and
regulations
has
to
be
determined
primarily
upon
the
authority
that
--
that
the
hearing
officer
or
the
board
has
in
relation
to
revocation
of
subpoenas.
and
since
the
act
itself
clearly
says
that
petitions
to
revoke
shall
be
referred
to
the
board
and
it
does
not
mention
the
possibility
of
any
agent
or
agency
or
does
not
permit
the
--
expressly
permit
the
delegation
of
that
power.
we
say
that
the
board
rules
are
(inaudible)
the
fifth
circuit
so
held.
we
think
that
citizens,
appearing
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
employers
appearing
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
witnesses,
should
have
a
responsible
agency
to
rule
upon
such
an
important
matter.
we
think
that
the
congress
intended
that
a
responsible
agency
rule
upon
revocation
of
subpoenas
to
wit,
the
board
itself.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
might
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
sections
of
the
act
clearly
shows
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
hearing
officers
should
not
have
any
extensive
powers.
in
the
taft-hartley
law,
the
labor
management
relations
act
passed
in
1947,
congress
inserted
the
provision
that
hearing
officers
could
not
make
even
recommendations
as
to
any
issue
that
was
to
go
to
the
board.
a
hearing
officer
is
merely,
in
effect,
a
reporter.
he
takes
a
record.
he
is
not
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence
and
every
hearing
officer
conducts
a
hearing,
clearly
states
that
before
he
starts
in
the
hearing.
it
is
not
going
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
evidence.
the
hearing
officers
merely
get
a
record.
they
can't
rule
on
motions
to
dismiss.
they
cannot
rule
on
any
issue
of
representation
under
the
act.
they
have
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
they
make
a
report
without
a
recommendation.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
--
i
mr.
theo
hamilton
--
would
think
that
the
act
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
it's
merely
a
summary
without
a
recommendation.
that
specifically
prohibits
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
no,
sir.
mr.
theo
hamilton
well
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
the
--
the
actual
practice
of
the
board
in
using
hearing
officers
and
the
wording
of
the
act
shows
clearly
that
no
authority
is
intended
to
be
vested
in
hearing
officers.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
permissible,
first,
if
the
law
permitted
it
and
didn't
prohibit
it.
i
think
that
the
law
prohibits
them
from
doing
that
in
this
case
as
to
revocation
of
subpoenas.
mr.
theo
hamilton
the
law
specifically
says
that
they
cannot
make
a
recommendation.
mr.
theo
hamilton
that's
right
sir.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i'd
say
that
the
board
is
trying
to
make
him
into
a
judicial
officer.
mr.
theo
hamilton
only
by
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
either
--
either
by
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
he
--
he
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
that's
right
sir.
mr.
theo
hamilton
again,
here's
the
word
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
the
executive
secretary
of
the
board
has
exactly
said
in
a
letter,
in
which
i
was
counsel,
hudson
pulp
and
paper
corporation,
12-ca-32
and
33
on
june
the
9th,
1957
in
which
i
appealed.
and
i
might
say
that
in
my
16
years
of
practice
before
the
board,
i've
never
had
an
appeal
granted
although,
i've
requested
in
many
times.
this
one
was
incorrect.
mr.
theo
hamilton
an
appeal
from
any
kind
of
a
ruling
of
a
hearing
officer
or
trial
examiner,
i
have
never
had
one
granted
by
the
board.
mr.
theo
hamilton
here's
what
they
said
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
it's
--
no.
here's
what
they
said,
that
i
--
i
did
not
furnish
sufficient
facts
upon
which
they
could
decide
the
appeal.
mr.
theo
hamilton
so
they
--
and
here's
what
they
wrote
back.
special
appeal
is
only
intended
to
provide
for
interlocutory
appeal
in
those
rare
cases,
where
an
aggrieved
party
can
show
quickly
that
a
trial
examiner's
ruling
should
not
await
the
procedure
under
section
102
(46).
mr.
theo
hamilton
are
you
asking
whether
they
would
have
the
authority
under
the
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
know
how
they
could
operate
in
that
way.
i
think
they
would
have
to
undertake
the
--
the
entertaining
of
the
petition
to
revoke
because
the
case
couldn't
proceed
unless
the
evidence
were
presumed
--
produced
presumably.
and
when
a
petition
to
revoke
is
filed,
directly
with
the
board,
the
board
rules
upon
it.
if
the
board
or
the
other
party
can't
proceed
without
the
evidence
then
of
course
the
hearing
is
adjourned
until
the
evidence
is
produced.
mr.
theo
hamilton
well,
in
--
in
justice
to
the
counsel
for
the
lewis
case,
i'd
rather
not
state
a
position
on
that.
in
this
case,
his
position
i'm
sure
will
be
that
--
that
you
can't
do
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
either.
now,
that
isn't
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
think
all
of
it's
devoted
to
that,
sir.
i
--
i'm
not
concerned
with,
in
this
case,
with
the
powers
of
a
trial
examiner
because
they're
entirely
different.
one's
under
the
administrative
procedures
act,
the
hearing
officers
in
representation
cases
are
not.
all
of
the
cases
of
which
i
am
aware
have
involved
unfair
labor
practice
cases
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
there's
only
--
there's
only
two
cases
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
that's
right.
there
are
only
two
cases
of
which
i
am
aware,
in
which
the
power
of
a
hearing
officer
to
revoke
a
subpoena
has
been
involved
and
that's
the
pesante
case
in
california
and
this
case.
only
two
cases
have
ever
been
decided
insofar,
as
i
know.
mr.
theo
hamilton
yes,
sir.
it
was
the
same
as
this
in
that
respect.
mr.
theo
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
theo
hamilton
that's
right.
mr.
theo
hamilton
in
a
way
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
congress
--
congress
changed
it.
mr.
theo
hamilton
the
practice
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
very
little
happened
in
--
in
relation
to
subpoenas
and
i
think
counsel
for
the
board
will
bear
me
out
on
that,
very
little
happened.
and
the
board
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
you
mean
prior
to
taft-hartley?
mr.
theo
hamilton
the
regulations
of
the
board
did
not
cover
revocation
of
subpoenas
prior
to
taft
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
no
provision
at
all.
mr.
theo
hamilton
it
is
this,
your
honor.
congress
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
well,
i'd
just
wanted
to
go
into
the
reasons
for
changing
the
subpoena
procedures
in
taft-hartley.
it's
pretty
well
established.
in
fact,
the
board
admits
it
in
its
brief
that
the
board
was
one
of
the
administrative
agencies,
which
was
under
severe
criticism
because
they
permitted
their
own
counsel
to
have
subpoenas
and
--
and
required
everybody
else
to
only
get
them
on
a
showing
of
relevant
--
relevancy
on
a
written
application
for
it.
so,
congress
undertook
to
correct
that
criticism
and
changed
it
so
that
they
made
it
mandatory
that
a
subpoena
be
issued
when
it's
requested.
now,
that
became
the
law
in
1947.
so
there
was
a
criticism
against
the
board
and
other
administrative
agencies
in
that
respect.
then
in
addition
to
that,
congress
attempted
to
put
in
the
hands
of
the
board
itself
a
responsible
agency
the
question
of
ruling
--
judicial
ruling,
if
you
please,
on
revocations
of
subpoenas.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
wouldn't
want
to
disappoint
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
intended
to
say
that
before
(inaudible)[laughter]
the
--
i
would
like
to
quote
one
statement
from
the
act
relating
to
the
hearing
officers."
such
hearing
may
be
conducted
by
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
regional
office,
who
shall
not
make
any
recommendations
with
respect
thereto."
that's
about
as
broad
as
it
could
be
in
cutting
his
power
down
to
nothing.
mr.
theo
hamilton
that's
in
representation
proceedings
only.
now,
the
board's
practice
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
in
1947,
was
to
permit
hearing
officers,
and
they
were
all
called
trial
examiners
in
those
days.
both
hearing
officers
in
representation
cases
and
hearing
officers
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases,
was
to
permit
them
to
rule
in
the
first
instance
on
applications
for
subpoenas
and
if
they
chose
not
to
issue
a
subpoena,
they
didn't
issue.
now,
the
practice
of
the
board
since
the
labor
management
relations
act
has
been
exactly
the
same.
the
act
of
congress
has
not
changed
it
and
practically
affected
all,
and
the
only
way
we
can
get
it
changed
is
to
have
a
court
change
it.
as
a
practical
matter,
a
person
who's
asked
for
a
subpoena
in
a
hearing,
in
a
representation
case
hearing,
is
told
by
the
hearing
officer,
i've
got
to
issue
it
because
it's
mandatory
but
i
will
revoke
it
and
he
tells
the
other
party
how
to
revoke
it.
in
the
(inaudible)
case
cited
by
the
board,
i
quoted
from
the
transcript
in
that
case
in
my
brief,
"the
hearing
officer
told
the
person
that
was
asking
for
a
subpoena
i've
got
to
issue
it
but
i
will
immediately
entertain
a
motion
to
revoke
it
and
grant
it."
and
then
the
union's
representative
who
had
asked
for
it
says,
"now,
let
me
understand
clearly
just
what
you
want
me
to
do."
so,
in
--
in
practical
effect,
what
the
board
has
been
doing
ever
since
the
labor
management
relations
act
is
just
exactly
as
it's
been
doing
before.
what
good
does
it
do
in
any
respect,
insofar
as
the
words
and
the
mandate
of
congress
is
concerned,
to
permit
a
hearing
officer,
in
a
representation
case,
instead
of
saying,
i
will
issue
the
subpoena.
i
will
issue
it
but
i
will
immediately
revoke
it.
it
subverts
the
intent
of
congress
entirely
in
respect
to
the
revocation
of
subpoenas.
mr.
theo
hamilton
the
intent
of?
mr.
theo
hamilton
that
and
the
committee
reports.
and
at
this
time
i
will
point
out
the
committee
reports,
which
have
a
direct
bearing
on
it.
first,
again,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
words
of
the
act
aren't
ambiguous.
they
are
just
as
clear
as
the
english
language
can
make
them.
congress
knew
what
the
--
the
practice
in
the
procedure.
the
board
wasn't
just
as
obviously
intended
to
change
it
so,
no
amount
of
speculation,
no
concern
of
the
board
as
to
its
convenience.
no
question
as
to
what
is
wise
or
expedience
ought
to
be
used
to
change
that
plan
and
on
unambiguous
meaning,
but
we
can
go
further
than
that
to
show
what
congress
meant.
house
resolution
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
that's
correct,
sir.
only
by
the
board
or
by
a
panel
of
the
board.
mr.
theo
hamilton
yes.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
--
i
think
that
the
general
practice
and
i
understand
corrected
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
board,
a
general
practice
was
that
they
decided
in
the
first
instance
whether
one
would
be
issued
or
not
and
they
have
no
procedure
for
revocation.
mr.
theo
hamilton
yes,
sir.
mr.
theo
hamilton
well,
if
--
if
we
--
well
remember,
we
didn't
have
an
administrative
procedures
act
to
make
any
differentiation
between
these
two
officers
and
he
would
just
have
to
fall
back
on
general
law.
frankly,
i
did
not
--
i
have
not
ever
had
a
case
involving
subpoenas
until
after
the
taft-hartley
law.
so,
in
my
present
experience
is
nil
on
that.
and
i
know
of
--
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
other
cases
involving
subpoenas
that's
prior
to
taft-hartley.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
think
they
intended
to
permit
the
board
to
handle
matters
of
this
kind
with
a
three-member
panel
as
you
know
they
now
do
and
i
think
that
would
--
i
think
it
has
very
greatly
helped
the
board
in
the
handling
of
its
cases.
house
resolution
3020,
has
a
reason
to
pass
by
the
house,
contained
a
provision
about
revocation
stating
that
the
person
subpoenaed
might
petition
the
board
and
i
quote,
"or
its
duly
authorized
agents
or
agent
to
revoke
the
subpoena."
and
i
quote
again,
"if
in
its,
his
or
their
opinion,
the
subpoena
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
the
act."
now,
the
house
conference
report
510
on
house
resolution
3020
contained
wording
of
the
present
law,
leaving
out
references
to
the
agents
of
the
board.
and
the
board's
counsel
has
stated
here
that
senator
taft
made
a
statement.
they
only
intended
to
change
the
act
in
one
particular
in
his
brief
says
and
i
quote
from
page
47,
"as
stated
by
senator
taft,
section
11
authorizes
the
board
to
conduct
hearings
and
investigations
in
the
subpoena
witnesses.
this
section
has
not
changed
in
the
senate
amendment
and
was
modified
by
the
countries
in
only
one
respect.
now,
what
he
says
is
true
but
what
he
doesn't
tell
you
is
that
that's
the
senate
amendment,
not
the
act
that
became
law.
because
that
changed
it
in
two
respects,
not
only
the
filing
of
mandatory
issuance
of
subpoenas
but
as
to
revocation
of
subpoenas.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
think,
of
course,
that
it
is.
i
think
that
a
court
ought
always
to
be
permitted
to
rule
upon
administrative
agencies,
prior
rulings
in
matters
of
this
kind.
mr.
theo
hamilton
the
board
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
the
board
always
alleges,
i
think,
it
certainly
has
in
this
case,
that
the
respondents
have
been
guilty
of
contumacious
conduct.
now,
they
have
not
pursued
that.
they
have
a
rule
on
contumacious
conduct
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
rule
itself
would
cover
that
but
they
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
the
board
always
alleges
that
it
constitutes
contumacious
conduct
but
i
don't
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
sir?
mr.
theo
hamilton
[laughs]
and
as
i
said,
they've
never
tried
to
follow
that
up
but
they
always
alleged
it.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
there'd
be
any
phases
for
pursuing
it.
but
i
think
that
probably
that's
a
reason
that
they
have.
now,
congress
could
have
made
expressed
provisions
for
delegation
of
authority
if
it
wished
to
do
so.
it
did
in
the
case
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
the
federal
power
commission,
the
tariff
commission,
the
u.s.
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
--
maritime
commission.
mr.
theo
hamilton
have
--
have
specific
powers
to
permit
the
delegation
of
other
power.
mr.
theo
hamilton
i'm
not
sure,
sir,
whether
they
were
in
the
original
act
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
i
got
this
information
from
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
case.
now,
the
board
has
--
not
dwell
too
much
on
the
cudahy
case.
the
cudahy
case
we
think
is
ruling
here.
the
court
considered
a
--
a
case
very
similar
on
the
law.
the
act
in
congress
had
a
prior
history
exactly
the
same
as
this
act
and
we
think
that
the
reasoning
of
the
court
there
should
apply
here.
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
statement
--
mr.
theo
hamilton
thank
you,
sir.
i'd
appreciate
making
one
more
statement.
the
board
has
talked
about
exhaustion
of
remedies.
i
merely
want
to
point
out
that
the
rule
of
the
board
does
not
require
a
person
to
use
that
appeal.
it's
merely
a
permission
to
ask
for
permission
to
appeal
and
therefore
the
administrative
exhaustion
of
--
of
remedies
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
