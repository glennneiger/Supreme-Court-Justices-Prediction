justice
charles

whittaker
(inaudible)
that
the
specific
language
(inaudible)
that
requires
an
action
--
an
application
for
revocation
of
a
subpoena
to
bring
to
board
is
--
still
empowers
the
board
to
delegate
initial
action
on
such
motions,
plans,
the
redress
from
the
hearing
officer
or
trial
examiners
actually
is
only
by
a
discretionary
review
which
the
board
may
or
may
not
allow.
and
usually
doesn't
allowed
and
then
say
we
will
examine
after
adverse
result
upon
that
would
deal
from
a
whole
case.
and
that's
what
i
meant
about
these
clowns
scrambling
the
egg.
if
the
testimony
should
not
have
been
produced
and
it
--
and
it
has
been
required
and
it's
done
injury
that
can't
be
undone
later,
can
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
do
you
think
that
this
idea
of
allowing
the
board
the
discretionary
review
after
and
you
knew
after
it's
required
this
hearing
officer
as
the
whole
of
the
end
of
a
new
deal
that's
your
protection?

do
