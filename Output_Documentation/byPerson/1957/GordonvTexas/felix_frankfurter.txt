that's
the
(voice

justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
--
the
permittee
provision
of
the
law
in
the
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
delivery
it
means,
what
it
means
to
you,
could
texas
provide
as
a
means
of
enforcing
a
liquor
statute
and
in
the
interest
of
avoiding
what
one
has
a
right
to
assume
or
the
opportunities
for
evasion
that
even
a
fellow
texas
stuff
through
should
get
a
permit
to
take
it
through,
could
texas
do
that?
i'm
not
saying
it
has
done
it
but
could
it,
not
merely
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
use
in
the
state
would
have
a
control
system
of
stuff
going
through
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
it
could?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
texas
couldn't
say
--
awfully
easy
to
say,
we're
just
going
through
rather
than
consume
again
in
the
state,
you
better
get
a
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
admitting
that.
couldn't
it
as
a
matter
of
assuring
the
state
that
it's
going
through
or
not
stopping
there
or
being
used
there
or
sold
on
the
way
to
some
foreign
or
profitable
transaction,
couldn't
it
as
a
means
of
administration
exercise
that
(inaudible)?
i'm
not
saying
it
has
done
so
that
this
statute
is
susceptible
to
that
construction,
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
making
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
it's
above
--
if
in
fact
--
if
in
fact
as
a
matter
of
truth,
somebody
brings
in
liquor
from
--
from
mexico
into
texas
to
go
to
texas
or
the
chief
justice
suggested
new
mexico,
texas
can
do
nothing
about
assuring
the
fact
that
he
is
going
to
go
through
to
new
mexico
rather
than
make
a
profitable
sale
having
changed
his
mind
instead
of
bringing
it
to
his
father-in-law
making
a
profitable
turn
of
the
penny
in
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
mean
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
that's
how
you
construe
the
--
what
is
it,
the
nineteenth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
in
detail
that
will
become
--
stating
in
detail,
in
precise
detail
the
exact
procedure
that
a
person
bona
fide
in
good
faith
and
with
unchanging
purpose
bringing
in
liquor
from
texas
to
move
on
to
north
carolina,
what
he
would
do
or
what
he
would
be
able
to
do
at
the
port
of
entry
once
he
gets
into
the
texas
(inaudible)
exactly
what
he
would
have
to
do
or
he
would
be
able
do?
what
machinery
goes
through?
what
it
would
cost
him
if
anything,
what
return
if
anything
would
be
made
of
any
fee
that
he
has
to
pay,
could
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
an
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
texas
has
legislation
by
which
nobody
in
a
private
car
can
get
liquor
through
the
state
of
texas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
lot
fee
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
prohibiting
the
carriage
of
liquor
in
private
car.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
beyond
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
beyond
that
he
--
he
can
pay
a
thousand
dollars
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
specific
provision
which
translates
legislatively
what
you
said
that
this
is
a
measure
in
keeping
what
the
transportation
through
or
in
texas
of
liquor
by
a
private
--
personal
automobile?
where
is
that
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
this
--
can
you
reverse
to
the
decisions
of
your
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
132
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
ultimately
to
supreme
court
of
criminal
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice

for
our
purpose,
it
is
the
law
of
texas
declared
by
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
our
purpose
of
the
law
of
texas
or
written
to
your
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
(inaudible)
or
anybody
and
the
chief
justice
driving
from
texas
(inaudible)
something
that
he
can't
have
(inaudible)
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
he
pays?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
that
but
he
would
be
--
he
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
isn't
--
it's
not
--
i
don't
know
where
to
take
this
--
but
this
is
not
a
fiscal
tax.
justice

licensing
whom
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
people
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
had
a
case
in
--
did
this
court
have
occasion
to
construe
delivery
in
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
include
physical
(inaudible)
coming
into
a
state
and
transfer
it
to
another
state.
do
we
have
a
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
your
--
this
statute
according
to
what
you've
told
us
of
the
rulings
of
your
court,
raises
a
question
whether
the
twenty-first
amendment
giving
texas
power
to
deal
with
liquor
brought
--
for
delivery
or
use
(inaudible)
does
bring
into
play
what
the
delivery
covers
within
the
scope
of
that
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
like
many
or
a
few
opinions
that
had
been
written
by
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
carter
in
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
must
be
your
confession
that
this
is
not
(voice

the
holding
of
a
(inaudible)
giving
texas
regular
authoritative
power
over
liquors
within
its
physical
confines,
includes
liquor
that
it
is
only
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
and
according
to
your
statement,
this
couldn't
have
--
you
couldn't
get
any
tax
stamp
possessed
because
a
private
person
bringing
in
liquor
cannot
get
legalized
right
to
bring
it
to
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
no
tax
is
paid
to
be
sure
but
he
couldn't
possibly
pay
it.
but
nevertheless,
you
say
it
contraband
because
he
is
a
fellow
who
can't
get
a
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
to
sustain
your
--
your
conviction,
you
have
to
show
not
only
possession
of
this
liquor
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
your
court
--
if
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
says
that
a
fellow
who
has
in
his
possession
liquor
without
appropriate
stamp,
had
violated
the
statute
and
it
is
no
defense
that
he
is
a
fellow
who
couldn't
possibly
get
a
stamp
because
he
is
forbidden
from
carrying
it
at
all
but
the
determination
is
not
reviewable
by
this
court.
that's
the
local
law
of
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
early
suggestion
and
early
words
from
the
appellant,
but
is
there
any
suggestion
that
this
conviction
offense
the
due
process
clause
because
he
was
convicted
procedurally
for
the
wrong
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
as
if
(voice

--
justice

all
the
satisfaction
of
the
--
of
the
information
of
--
of
the
status

the
adequacy
of
evidence
to
satisfy
the
information
as
before.
justice

that
was
on
page
21?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
stewart.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
texas
obtain
liquor
from
coming
in
at
all?
could
texas
say
make
himself
a
prohibition
state
for
his
own
people
and
interest
of
enforcement
of
effectiveness
involved
or
any
liquor
coming
in
from
many
other
states
or
from
any
foreign
countries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
stamped?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
stamped?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
--
why
didn't
your
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
the
right
to
fine
the
crime
that's
made
up.
you
say
because
he
didn't
think
it
was
--
no
stamp
is
required.
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there's
no
tax
at
all.
all
fiscal,
all
dollar
and
cents
(inaudible)
and
texas
has
a
separable
colloquially
drawn
statute
which
says
that
in
view
of
the
illusive
character
and
the
slippery
nature
of
liquor
when
you
want
to
concentrate
attention
or
enforcement
by
providing
that
liquor
can
be
transported
within
the
bounds
of
texas
whether
from
one
place
to
another
or
coming
in
from
mexico
and
going
outside
the
other
way
around
from
north
to
south.
that
can
be
only
done
by
licensed
carriers
not
a
--
and
anybody
who
brings
the
license
carrier
and
carry
this
liquor
shall
be
guilty
of
an
offense.
no
taxation
and
no
money
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
says
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
story.
that's
(inaudible)
the
power
of
the
government
or
its
military.
that's
a
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
the
point
of
that
was
that
it's
a
government
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
for
all
practical
purposes
like
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
export-import
clause
is
out
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
liquor
i
mean.
that's
to
liquor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
purely
restrict
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you're
right
then
the
congress
of
united
states
having
nothing
else
to
do,
(inaudible)
the
purpose
statute
saying
that
texas
and
all
the
other
states
may
do
what
they
please
within
their
confines
but
may
deal
the
liquor
traffic
so
important
for
national
security
or
whatnot,
the
enjoyment
of
people
which
enlarge
their
morale
that
liquor
shall
be
allowed
to
come
in
every
state
--
in
one
state
to
another
and
one
foreign
country
into
other
state.
could
they
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
yet
--
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
within
its
boundary.
this
is
liquor
that
came
into
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
but
you
say
it
does
lead
free
indeed
cast
upon
this
court
the
duty
of
determining
whether
a
particular
measure
or
dry
state
is
fairly
calculated
to
protect
the
dryness
of
that
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
do
that?
didn't
your
argument
get
down
that
we
must
say
that
this
is
not
related
to
the
protection
of
texas
as
a
dry
state?
