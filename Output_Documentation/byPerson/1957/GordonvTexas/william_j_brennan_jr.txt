justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
that's
about
getting
a
permit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
also
the
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
richard's
tell
me.i
don't
quite
follow
it.
why
was
that
the
--
that
texas
then
in
phase
of
his
declaration
of
intention
to
take
it
in
north
carolina
insisted
on
the
payment
of
the
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
should
have
happened,
i
gather
on
your
theory
is
that
each
of
them
could
have
kept
one
bottle
or
three
of
them,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
(voice
overlap)
they
accepted
to
have
to
pay
the
tax
from
the
one
bottle.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
on
the
basis
of
his
declaration
that
they're
going
to
the
north
carolina
with
it,
it
should
have
concede.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
everything
of
the
three
bottles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
effect,
i
gather,
he
could
not
encourage
himself
of
the
offense
even
if
subsequently
he
had
paid
the
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
didn't
have
to
take
him
back
to
the
bridge
and
give
him
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me.
does
any
of
texas
position
depend
on
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
position
that
you're
asserting
for
texas
depend
in
anyways
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
to
in
other
way
mr.
richards.
does
that
depend
also
on
our
concluding
that
delivery
does
include
possession
under
these
circumstances
that
delivery
within
the
meaning
of
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
i
mean
is
with
--
unless
this
regulation
authorized
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
does
your
case
fall?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
it
does?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
richards,
can
this
conviction
be
supported
under
the
language
of
this
information
merely
on
the
proof
that
at
least
one
quart
if
he
was
entitle
to
one
quart,
stamped,
he
could
have
carried
it
through
texas
but
he'd
need
--
he
did
not
have
even
one
quart
stamp.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
sure
that
liquor
in
fact
would
not
be
used
or
delivered
therein,
isn't
there
some
room
for
state
regulation
as
to
the
method
by
which
--
that
which
it
is
said
shall
be
carried
across
the
state?
they
may
be
assured
will
be
carried
across
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
for
example
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suppose
the
state
could
say
that
you
may
carry
it
across
here.
we
think
that
reasonably
to
be
sure
it
doesn't
stop
here
and
isn't
delivered
here
and
it
isn't
used
here.
it
may
go
across
only
by
common
carrier
in
the
bond.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
can't
--
may
they
not
--
i'm
assuming
the
question
justice
frankfurter
put
to
you,
it's
completely
dry
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
may
not
a
state
that
it
is
a
completely
dry
state
say
that
if
you
say
you're
going
to
take
it
across
into
another
state
just
to
be
sure
that
you
do,
we
insist
that
it
go
by
common
carrier
in
bond.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
meaning
of
twenty-first
amendment?
certainly,
it
must
allow
some
leeway
to
a
state,
doesn't
it,
to
regulate,
to
assure
that
there
shall
be
no
delivery
or
use
of
liquor
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
delivered
or
used
in
the
state
without
regard
to
what
the
congress
has
done?
