the
tax
for

--
justice

me

i'm
asking
about
texas
law.

does
it
permit
or
issue?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
they're
pretty
authoritative
on
their
--
when
it
comes
to
texas
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
court
says
that
it's
unlawful
to
import
liquor
into
texas
without
a
permit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
gets
pretty
close
if
that's
the
true
to
the
arkansas
case
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it's
here
and
it's
cited
by
the

i
have
it
in
front
of
me,

says
article

no
person
shall
import
to
the
state,
any
liquor
in
excess
of
what's
imported.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
unless
a
permit
will
be
first
obtained
from
the
border.that's
the
one
i
think
justice
black
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
mean
mr.
richards
that
if
he
paid
$100
could
he
--
he
could
not
have
taken
this
liquor
with
him?
justice
william
o.
douglas
give
$100
and
leave
the
liquor
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
would
he
get
it
across?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
would
he
get
it
across?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
not
in
transit
across.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
basically
your
argument.
