mr.
b.
r.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
that
we
have
today
is
a
bit
different
from
the
points
that
normally
get
publicity,
the
ones
of
the
federal
government
imposing
their
will
upon
the
state's
rights
of
the
various
states.
i
think
in
this
instance,
this
is
a
case
of
the
state
imposing
its
will
on
the
federal
rights
in
a
case.
we
have
involved
in
this
case
--
i
would
like
to
relate
the
facts
if
that's
permissible.
a
man
charged
with
possession
of
liquor
in
the
state
of
texas
on
which
the
texas
liquor
stamp
had
not
been
paid.
the
facts
involved
--
he
was
fined
incidentally
$100
in
the
county
court
of
hidalgo
county,
texas.
the
facts
involved
are
these.
mr.
gordon,
the
appellant,
his
wife
and
daughter
had
been
residing
for
sometime
in
cuernavaca,
mexico.
mr.
gordon
is
or
was
an
author.
his
wife
and
his
daughter
decided
that
they
should
return
to
the
states
and
in
the
process,
they
purchased
each
of
them
and
jointly
together,
12
bottles
of
mexican
liquor.
i
think
there
were
some
eight
or
nine
bottles
of
rums
and
some
other
types
of
brandy,
a
total
of
12
bottles.
they
reached
the
border
and
during
the
period
of
their
journey
with
11
bottles
as
they
cross
the
port
of
entry
in
hidalgo
--
hidalgo
county,
texas.
they
passed
through
the
u.s.
customs
inspection
and
after
clearance
through
the
customs
inspection
station,
they
were
approached
by
the
texas
state
control
board
official
on
duty
at
the
international
bridge
there
in
hidalgo
and
requested
that
they
pay
a
texas
state
liquor
tax
on
this
liquor
which
they
were
importing
from
the
state
of
mexico
--
republic
of
mexico.
they
were
merely
joining
--
he
requested
that
that
be
paid
and
the
appellant
refused.
his
offhand
remark
as
i
recall
the
testimony
was
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
he
left
the
port
of
entry
in
journeyed
towards
mcallen,
texas.
town
of
ten
miles
away,
he
was
stopped
in
the
process
by
state
highway
patrolmen,
some
seven
miles
distance
and
held
by
them
--
by
the
state
highway
patrolmen
until
some
officials
for
the
liquor
control
board
arrived
at
the
point
where
he
was
stopped.
he
was
taken
into
custody
by
the
officials
of
the
liquor
control
board
and
turned
to
the
international
bridge
and
given
the
opportunity
to
again
pay
the
texas
state
tax
and
he
again
he
refused.
the
officials
then
took
mr.
gordon
before
a
local
justice
of
the
peace
and
charged
him
with
the
possession
of
unstamped
liquor
in
the
state
of
texas.
he
was
held
in
jail
that
night
and
the
next
day
he
was
released
and
he
and
his
wife
and
daughter
continued
their
journey
to
the
state
of
north
carolina.
he
returned
in
november
and
was
tried
the
jury
--
before
a
jury
and
the
jury
verdict
was
guilty
and
a
fine
of
$100
was
given.
i
might
mention
that
the
car
that
he
was
driving
bore
a
north
carolina
license
plate
at
that
time.
now,
at
the
time
of
trial
prior
thereto
in
--
at
all
times
during
the
appeal,
we
raised
two
points
that
the
texas
liquor
tax
violated
the
u.s.
constitution
that
it
violated
it
--
the
portion
of
the
export-import
clause
where
congress
is
given
the
control
over
duties
on
exports
and
imports
and
secondly
on
the
commerce
clause.
we
presented
this
to
the
court
for
the
first
time
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
prior
to
trial.
we
also
had
a
sworn
motion
to
quash
prior
to
trial.
we
had
our
trial
--
both
of
those
motions
were
overruled.
we
had
a
trial.
i
had
a
motion
to
instruct
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
jury
based
on
these
two
grounds
and
some
others
that
were
local
in
nature.
that
motion
was
overruled.
the
verdict
was
brought
in.
i
mean
prior
to
that
time,
a
requested
instructions
of
the
court
to
the
jury,
upholding
and
showing
these
various
courses
of
the
constitutionality
that
--
so
that
they
could
be
presented
and
argued
to
the
jury.
these
instructions
were
used
by
the
court
and
then
the
verdict
was
held.
we
presented
our
exceptions,
our
bills
of
exceptions
on
all
of
those
points
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
state
of
texas.
and
in
their
opinion,
the
constitutionality
question
did
not
arise
or
it
was
not
pertinent
to
this
very
fact.
i
would
first
like
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
they
said
that
--
that
--
so
far
as
they
can
see
that
it
was
not
violative
of
the
constitution
in
both
instances
either
on
the
commerce
clause
or
under
the
export-import
clause.
the
export-import
portion
is
based
on
the
clause
which
gives
to
congress
the
complete
control
of
duties
on
exports
and
imports.
there's
one
exception
in
there
for
inspection
purposes
and
i
don't
think
that
enters
--
enter
this
case.
i
don't
think
it
entered
into
the
record,
any
place.
the
first
case
that
came
before
this
court
as
i
read
the
cases,
was
the
case
of
brown
versus
maryland
in
1837
i
believe,
chief
justice
marshall
wrote
the
opinion.
and
in
that
case,
he
set
up
what
is
known
as
the
original
package
doctrine
saying
that
when
a
thing
is
imported
from
a
foreign
country
or
without
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states,
then
such
import
is
not
subject
to
state
taxation
as
long
as
it
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
importer
that
the
same
is
in
the
original
package
and
under
the
control
of
the
import.
when
such
import
become
so
commingled
with
the
mass
of
the
goods
of
a
state
to
which
it
is
destined,
then
in
that
instance,
the
state
might
have
control
and
may
have
the
right
to
tax.
now,
this
case
was
considered
next
--
i
mean
the
provision
of
the
constitution
was
next
considered
by
the
court
in
the
license
cases.
there
were
three
cases
from
new
hampshire
and
massachusetts
in
rhode
island,
involving
the
question
of
a
local
ordinance
requiring
a
tax
on
sellers
of
liquor
in
the
local
towns
and
they
were
brought
up.
none
of
which
were
involved
on
a
direct
import
from
the
--
from
a
foreign
country.
they
had
gone
through
the
process
of
being
sold
or
were
out
of
the
importers
but
chief
justice
taney
and
several
of
the
other
justices
stated
that
if
the
liquor
involved
in
the
cases
had
been
a
foreign
import
that
the
--
the
town
ordinances
would
have
been
unconstitutional
that
the
tax
would
not
have
been
valid.
the
--
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases
along
that
line.
the
--
probably
a
pertinent
one
is
--
there
was
--
was
the
case
of
low
versus
austin
in
which
liquor
imported
from
france
was
taken
into
the
city
of
san
francisco
and
stored
in
the
warehouse
there.
the
city
of
san
francisco
attempted
to
assess
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
the
liquor
as
it
was
stored
in
the
warehouse.
it
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
original
importer.
and
they
import
or
paid
the
tax
and
then
sue
to
recover
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
an
unconstitutional
tax.
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
such
a
tax,
even
though
it
was
equal
to
all
goods
in
the
city
of
san
francisco,
not
discriminating
as
to
the
liquor
or
otherwise.
the
court
held
that
the
tax
was
invalid
because
the
import
was
still
in
--
in
the
hands
of
the
importer.
and
consequently,
it
was
not
subject
to
a
local
taxation.
it
had
not
become
a
part
of
the
general
mass
of
goods
of
the
--
the
state
or
the
tax
immunity
was
trying
to
levy
the
tax.
perhaps,
the
most
recent
case
considered
by
this
court
was
hooven
&
allison
co.
versus
evatt
involving
a
case
of
him.
now
these
ones
that
i've
cited
before
had
been
involving
liquor.
hooven
&
allison
co.
versus
evatt
involved
a
rope
manufacturer
in
the
state
of
ohio.
and
he
had
imported
him
from
india,
from
the
philippine
islands
and
various
other
places
and
stored
it
in
his
warehouse
in
ohio.
the
state
of
ohio
attempted
to
assess
the
ad
valorem
tax
on
that
import.
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
importer
and
was
not
subject
to
a
state
tax,
even
though
it
had
come
to
rest
in
the
state.
it
had
not
become
a
part
of
the
mass
of
goods
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
consequently
it
was
not
subject
to
a
tax.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
they
construed
it
as
a
used
tax.
that's
correct.
and
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir
i
say
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
--
the
reason
--
for
this
reason.as
part
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
here
involved
that
the
defendant
or
the
appellant
stated
to
elect
control
officers
that
he
had
no
intention
to
use
it,
dispose
of
it
or
sell
it
in
the
state
of
texas
that
he
was
merely
carrying
the
same
through
the
state
of
texas,
through
the
state
of
his
destination,
the
state
of
north
carolina.
and
we're
contending
that
the
tax
of
texas
was
invalid
for
--
it
was
still
an
import.
it
was
in
the
hands
of
an
importer,
the
appellant
herein.
and
that
he
was
merely
carried
through
the
state
of
texas.
if
texas
could
put
a
tax
on
it
in
louisiana,
mississippi,
alabama,
georgia,
all
the
rest
of
them
up
until
he
got
to
south
carolina
--
i
mean
north
carolina,
could
impose
a
tax
thereon
under
the
reason
the
meaning
of
state
tax
--
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir,
very
definitely.
i
think
it
runs
more
foul
of
the
export
clause
than
it
does
of
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
it
run
a
foul
on
both
them.
but
i
--
the
various
cases
that
this
court
has
passed
on
says
that
--
that
among
other
things
that
the
clause
was
put
in
the
constitution
to
make
the
policy
as
to
imports
uniform
throughout
the
united
states.
now,
the
state
of
texas
can
impose
a
tax,
whatever
they
wish
that
destroys
that
uniformity
of
policy
immediately.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
instance
has
passed
as
part
of
the
duty
statutes
or
the
import
statutes,
a
law
saying
that
a
person
returning
from
the
--
a
foreign
country
may
bring
in
as
part
of
the
goods
with
them
a
full
wine
galloon
of
liquor,
free
of
tax.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
sir?
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
the
question
will
permit
even
entered
into
this
particular
case.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
the
court
talks
about
it.
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
in
the
case.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
there
was
nothing
in
the
facts
as
to
whether
a
permit
was
issued,
could
have
been
issued
or
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
they
have
permits
of
certain
persons
that
are
allowed
to
have
permits.
in
this
particular
instance,
they
have
a
statute,
article
66-23
(a)
section
1
which
says
that
a
person
may
transport
liquor
from
a
place
where
the
purchase
or
the
sale
thereof
is
legal
to
where
a
--
the
possession
there
was
legal.
so
i
don't
believe
that
he
would
necessarily
have
to
have
a
permit.
i
think
the
court
was
mistaken
in
that
particular
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
true,
yes.
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
they
did
not
consider
that
section
that
states
that
a
person
may
transport
that
liquor
anywhere
in
the
state.
from
place
where
the
possession
of
--
is
the
sale
or
purchase
that
is
legal
to
a
place
where
the
possession
of
it
is
legal.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
a
person
went
as
one
of
the
justices
argued
there
i
think
in
one
of
the
concurring
opinions.
a
person
would
run
into
this
fact,
if
he
didn't
have
the
right
to
transport
liquor
from
the
liquor
store
where
he
bought
it
without
a
permit
to
his
home
then
you
would
run
into
a
complete
prohibition.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
that
that
again
runs
afoul
of
the
constitutional
provision.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
i
think
what
they're
saying
--
they're
--
they're
trying
to
--
control
imports
on
--
on
a
matter
that
congress
has
acted
on.
congress
had
said
that
a
person
returning
from
a
foreign
country
may
bring
in
a
wine
galloon
of
liquor
free
of
duty
which
to
me
would
imply
the
right
to
carry
that
to
any
place
in
united
states
without
interference
from
any
local
or
state
regulation.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
it
could
be
interpreted
any
other
way.
i'll
be
glad
to
read
that
section.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
in
any
event,
the
provision
was
put
in
the
constitution
to
eliminate
the
evil
of
maritime
or
border
states
controlling
imports
into
the
united
states.
if
they
have
the
right
to
tax,
they
would
have
the
right
to
enrich
their
own
treasuries
at
the
expense
of
the
border's
states.
i
mean
of
the
interior
states.
and
actually
that
your
uniform
policy
would
breakdown
immediately.
i
think
if
we
go
back
in
the
history,
we
can
find
it
under
the
constitutional
congress
that
--
under
the
continental
congress
that
that
was
a
big
part
of
their
problem
that
the
states
were
bickering.
they
had
no
uniform
policy
as
to
import
from
without
and
even
in
the
other
foreign
nations
were
taking
quite
an
advantage
of
it.
i
think
you
will
see
in
each
one
of
this
case
--
in
all
of
these
cases
that
the
courts
have
--
this
court
has
maintained
that
the
import
does
not
end
immediately
upon
arriving
into
the
united
states
that
its
immunity
as
an
import
survives
until
it
reaches
its
final
destination.
and
until
such
time
as
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
mass
of
goods
of
that
state.
now,
there
are
two
cases
out
of
california,
one
by
the
supreme
court
and
one
by
the
court
of
appeals,
von
hamm-young
company
versus
city
and
county
of
san
francisco
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
california,
march
14,
1947.
and
they
go
back
--
and
this
von
hamm
case
and
the
(inaudible)
company
versus
city
and
county
of
san
francisco,
again
are
involved
--
involved
imports
of
liquor
coming
into
the
united
states
and
the
attempt
by
a
political
subdivision
other
than
the
federal
government
to
impose
a
tax
on
those
imports.
now
granted
that
these
were
big
importers
but
i
think
it
equally
applies
to
the
person
who
brings
it
in
under
the
federal
statutes
that
allowed
them
to
do
it
as
well
as
to
a
large
scale
of
import.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
it
is
not
set
up
or
so.
no,
sir.
it
is
uniformed
throughout
the
state.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
well,
there
again
--
that's
--
that's
the
position
that
the
state
has
maintained
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
it
maintain
--
we
say
that
the
tax
is
invalid
because
it
is
still
an
import
and
hence
not
subject
to
any
tax
are
controlled
by
the
state
of
texas
until
it
has
become
a
part
of
the
mass
of
goods
of
the
state
of
texas.
this
is
in
its
original
--
these
bottles
were
in
their
original
package
or
carried
by
the
defendant
or
attempt
to
be
carried
by
the
appellant
through
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
there
was
not
one
--
there
was
one
broken
in
the
possession
of
the
liquor
control
agents.
i
assume
it
is
either
evaporated
or
drained
away.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
it
was
broken
accidentally.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no.
the
--
there
was
one
that
had
been
either
broken
or
used
in
the
trip
prior
to
the
time
that
they
left
for
the
border.
so
that
they
had
11
bottles
within
the
limitation
that
is
allowed
by
the
import
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
say
--
i
say
the
--
each
bottle,
the
four
bottles
or
five
bottles
per
--
mr.
gordon
--
that
mr.
gordon
had,
the
five
bottles
that
his
wife
had
and
the
two
bottles
that
his
daughter
had
or
one
bottle
that
the
daughter
had,
are
the
original
package.
that
is
the
form
in
which
they
were
imported.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
in
this
instance
that
they
would
be.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
i
--
it
wouldn't
--
a
sealed
case,
i
would
say
no
because
there
were
different
types
of
liquor
involved.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
twelve
bottles
in
the
case,
that's
normal.
yes,
sir
but
they
were
various
kinds.
in
other
words,
there
were
rum
and
brandy
and
i
think
some
(inaudible)
of
some
type,
so
that
each
bottle
would
have
been
with
the
individual.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
that
he
carried
it
in
a
carton
--
that
they
carry
it
in
a
carton
and
had
put
it
in
the
trunk
of
their
car.
the
other
point
is
the
fact
that
it
violates
commerce
clause.
here,
we
have
a
question
arouse
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
this
man
was
actually
in
interstate
commerce,
transporting
across
the
state
line.
but
the
case
of
simpson
versus
u.s.,
i
think
sets
that
at
rest,
involved
a
man
transporting
five
bottles
of
liquor
across
the
--
a
state
line
into
a
state
where
the
manufacture
of
liquor
was
prohibited.
and
he
was
filed
on
under
a
federal
statute
for
transporting.
so
--
and
they
held
--
and
this
court
held
that
he
was
in
the
interstate
commerce.
so
i
think
that
we
have
our
appellant
within
the
interstate
commerce
provision.
and
that
the
cases
are
numerous
in
a
state
that
a
tax
on
goods
moving
in
the
interstate
commerce
is
an
invalid
--
invalid
tax
as
an
undue
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce.
there
were
a
number
of
cases
that
bothers
me
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
court
had
passed
on
liquor
question
a
number
of
times
in
connection
with
the
twenty-first
amendment.
and
i
think
that
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
court
has
held
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
enact
regulatory
measures
concerning
the
interstate
transportation
of
liquor.
so
long
as
the
same
does
not
violate
some
action
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
here
again,
i
say
that
the
provision
that
congress
has
allowed
the
person
to
bring
in
not
less
than
one
wine
galloon
of
liquor
for
his
own
personal
use,
implies
that
if
he
has
the
right
to
transport
that
to
his
home
or
to
his
residence
and
that
any
--
any
state
action
to
the
contrary
must
be
on
constitution.
the
--
perhaps
the
most
recent
case
was
the
case
of
carter
versus
the
commonwealth
or
carter
versus
virginia
before
this
court
in
1944.
that
the
court
said
at
that
time,
it
has
been
held
that
a
shipment
through
a
state
is
not
transportation
or
importation
into
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
amendment,
talking
about
the
twenty-first
amendment.
it
is
enough
that
virginia
could
conclude
in
the
absence
of
contrary
federal
legislation
that
she
could
not
safely
permit
the
transportation
of
liquor
through
her
territory
by
those
who
concededly
mean
to
break
federal
laws
and
the
rules
of
a
neighboring
state.
now,
i
say
that
by
the
action
of
the
congress
in
allowing
a
person
to
bring
this
import
in,
free
of
duty,
is
such
federal
legislation
or
federal
action
as
the
court
had
in
mind
and
that
consequently,
being
in
interstate
commerce
that
the
state
action
of
trying
to
impose
a
tax
on
goods
moving
through
the
state
must
be
void
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
were
uniform
as
to
all
liquor
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
under
the
decision
of
this
court
that
they
have
a
right
to
limit
it
to
a
--
as
to
how
it's
carried.
i
don't
think
they
could
prohibit
transportation
through
the
state.
in
other
words,
you
could
go
--
go,
say
new
hampshire
up
here
could
--
i
mean
maine
could
be
standing
by
one
of
the
border
states
there.
by
that
state
saying
no
liquor
maybe
transported
through
this
state
and
that
maine
would
be
completely
dry
as
far
as
land
transportation
is
concerned.
is
that
--
the
--
i
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
here,
i
think
they
are
pertinent.
i
think
that
they
uphold
a
position
that
we're
trying
to
maintain.
i
think
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
the
state
of
texas
was
completely
an
error.
in
this
respect,
they
said,
they
assumed
that
the
importation
must
have
been
completed
at
the
time
that
tax
was
applied
to
this
liquor.
and
i
think
their
error
was
in
assuming
that
that
importation
was
completed
the
very
instant
--
instant
that
it
entered
the
state
of
texas.
an
import
remains
an
import
until
such
time
as
it
reaches
its
final
destination
and
becomes
a
part
of
the
mass
of
the
goods
for
the
state.
in
this
case,
it
could
not
have
been
under
the
admitted
facts,
undisputed
facts.
he
says,
i'm
not
going
to
use
it,
i'm
not
going
to
sell
it,
i'm
not
going
to
dispose
of
it,
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything
with
it
but
carry
it
through
the
state
of
texas,
through
the
state
of
louisiana,
through
the
state
of
alabama
up
to
north
carolina.
and
yet,
they
maintained
that
texas
has
a
legal
right
to
tax
that.we
say
that
the
import
survives
in
any
tax
regardless
of
what
is
an
ad
valorem
tax,
whether
it's
a
used
tax
or
any
type
of
tax
by
the
state
of
texas
is
completely
invalid
under
the
foreign
export-import
clause
in
the
constitution
and
the
foreign
commerce
clause
for
that
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
they
say
upon
the
use
--
the
tax
is
set
up
on
this
basis
as
it
is
here
by
levied
on
the
first
sale
of
liquor
in
addition
to
the
other
fees
and
tax
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
that's
the
way
this
--
the
act
reached.
it
is
hereby
levied
and
imposed
on
the
first
sale
in
addition
to
the
other
fees
and
taxes
levied
by
this
act
that
followed.
a
tax
of
$1.40
per
galloon
on
each
galloon
of
the
sales
first,
and
it
goes
on
to
say
the
first
--
the
term
for
sale
as
used
in
article
1
of
this
act
shall
mean
include
and
include
the
for
sale
possession,
distribution
or
use
in
the
state
of
any
and
all
liquor
refined,
blended,
manufactured,
imported
into
or
in
any
other
manner
produced
or
require,
possessed
or
brought
in
to
the
state.
and
clearly,
used
tax
are
sales
tax.
it
is
part
of
a
general
regulatory
statute.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
agree.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
it's
a
mere
possession
in
the
state
of
texas
enough
for
the
tax
to
apply.
we
say
the
possession
is
not
enough
because
we
are
carrying
it
through
the
state
as
an
import,
as
an
exempt
import
or
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that
is
undisputed.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
one
other
point
i
might
bring
out
in
the
--
in
the
evidence
that
was
presented
in
my
questioning
--
the
control
agents,
they
stated
--
i
asked
them
if
there
were
any
other
places
in
the
state
of
texas
whereby
a
person
could
purchase
a
tax
stamp
and
place
it
on
the
liquor,
unstamped
liquor
other
than
the
texas-mexico
border.
and
they
said
no.
that
the
only
place
they
have
them
are
on
the
border
between
texas
and
mexico,
none
between
texas
and
new
mexico,
none
between
texas
and
oklahoma
and
none
between
texas
and
louisiana
or
arkansas
that
it
is
only
on
the
mexican
border
where
the
persons
are
stopped
in
a
tax
collection.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
there
are
provisions
in
the
act
--
actually
when
this
first
came
up,
i
was
quite
of
a
lost
to
determine
under
what
sections
they
were
charging
the
defendant.
and
i'm
still
not
really
sure.
there
are
number
of
sections
in
the
act
that
involved
either
importation
or
the
sale
as
--
as
we
have
here
and
to
somewhat
conflict.
i
mean
there
are
somewhat
of
conflict
within
the
act
itself.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
other
than,
say
you're
common
carriers
or
you're
a
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
--
carrier
such
as
that.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
well,
i
don't
think
under
the
circumstances
if
it
were
--
if
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
i
don't
think
he
could
transport
it
without
a
permit
from
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
there
are
some
30
types
of
permits
as
i
recall.
he
would
either
have
to
get
a
wholesaler
or
wholesale
distributor's
permit
or
a
license
under
--
as
a
common
carrier.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
then
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
don't
believe
so.
in
other
words
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
--
i
think
he
would
have
to
pay
the
tax
and
i
don't
think
they'll
let
him
transport.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
feel
that
--
that
the
whole
statute,
anything
that
has
to
do
with
imports
is
void
under
the
constitution
because
they
have
imposed
a
state
will
on
the
imports
from
a
foreign
country
and
consequently
violated
this
uniformity
that
is
not
only
desirable
but
is
imperative
and
that
the
control
of
such
is
within
the
federal
government.
it's
not
one
of
these
fields
that
--
that
the
state
can
act
in.
it's
prohibited
to
them
and
that
anything
that
comes
in
conflict
with
that
probation
must
be
violative
of
the
constitution
as
this
tax,
we
contend
is.
consequently,
if
the
tax
is
not
valid
that
he
owed
no
tax,
there
was
no
offense
and
the
prosecution
must
fail
because
he's
prosecuted
simply
for
having
the
possession
of
unstamped
liquor.
and
that
it
was
elicit
because
it
was
unstamped.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
not
unless
you
come
in
under
one
of
the
permittees
that
are
allowed
under
the
statute.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
right.
incidentally
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes.
and
they
say
that
--
well,
there's
just
any
permit
unless
you
have
to
be
a
wholesale
leader
or
retail
leader
or
something
like
that.
no
way
that
an
individual
for
his
own
personal
use
other
than
the
statute
that
i
cited,
this
23
(a)
section
1,
can
transport
liquor
across
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
now
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
correct.
it
says
to
import
for
delivery
or
use
therein.
we're
not
--
we're
not
delivering
or
using
it
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
unless
your
possession
is
used
and
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
merely
carrying
out
the
(inaudible)
act
which
was
--
people
from
bringing
it
into
the
state
in
violation
of
their
laws
for
use
and
delivery,
use
or
delivery,
either
way
in
that
state.
delivery
to
me
implies
that
it
will
be
used
in
that
state
or
get
in
that
state.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
don't
see
how
because
his
intentions
were
to
carry
it
completely
through
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
it
was
uncontroverted.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
don't
think
they
could
in
this
--
in
this
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
sir.i
don't
think
they
could.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
not
under
the
statute
that
congress
has
passed
allowing
a
person
to
bring
into
this
country,
duty
free,
one
--
no
more
than
one
wine
galloon
of
liquor.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
not
because
the
import
gives
it
--
the
import
law
gives
him
the
right
to
carry
it
to
their
final
destination.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
in
this
instance.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
--
i
think
that
texas
--
anything
that
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
well,
i
think
you'd
run
into
the
de
minimis
proposition
there
on
that
particular
one
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
because
they
are
limited
to
bring
in
liquor
personally
to
one
wine
of
galloon,
that's
(inaudible)
of
liquor.
and
that
consequently,
the
statute
gives
them
that
right
to
carry
it
through
without
interference
of
any
sort
by
the
state
statute
or
the
state
because
texas
come
along
and
say
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
twenty-first.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
based
on
what
argument
i've
tried
to
present
here.
i
honestly
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
and
dismiss
the
prosecution.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice
and
gentlemen.
i
would
like
to
clear
up
something
that
seems
to
have
puzzled
you
as
i
see
it.
the
information
in
this
particular
case
charged
possession,
illegal
possession
of
the
liquor
and
that
the
reason
that
possession
was
illegal
was
because
the
appellant
herein
had
not
paid
the
stamp
tax
due
on
that
liquor.
if
he
had
paid
the
stamp
tax
and
affixed
it
on
the
bottle,
he
never
would
have
been
charged.
that
was
the
sole
point
for
the
court
that
he
had
not
paid
the
tax,
consequently,
his
possession
was
illegal
because
the
tax
was
not
paid.
he
claimed
that
the
tax
was
not
valid,
therefore
he
was
not
--
he
did
not
need
to
pay
the
tax.
and
if
he
did
not
need
to
pay
the
tax,
he
could
not
be
charge
with
illegal
possession
of
the
liquor
for
--
for
not
having
tax
payments
on
it.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
in
fact
that
was
--
this
is
going
outside
of
the
record
perhaps
but
as
long
as
the
tourist
prior
to
the
decision
set
down
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
paid
the
tax,
any
known
which
they
were
from
they
could
bring
in
four
quarts
of
liquor,
pay
the
tax
and
transport
through
the
state
of
texas.
that
was
done
in
custody.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
for
use
and
delivery
therein,
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
they
are
in
transit
across.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
they
could
devise
a
method,
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
they
could
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
they
could
even
do
this
that
they
could
say
for
instance,
you
can
bring
this
liquor
through,
we
will
stamp
it
or
we
will
seal
it.
and
you
report
at
the
texas
border
where
you
leave
the
state
of
texas,
if
you
--
you
have
used
any
liquor
then
you
pay
the
tax.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
don't
think
they
could
for
this
reason
that
the
congress
has
passed
legislation
saying
that
they
may
import
that.
and
that
since
congress
has
acted
the
state
cannot
deny
the
person
the
right
to
bring
in
that
gallon
of
liquor.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
but
in
this
instance,
i
think
--
i
think
that's
what
this
court
has
held
that
they
may
regulate,
for
instance
in
the
carter
case.
they
require
that
person
to
--
and
incidentally,
this
was
commercial
transportation
involved
in
the
carter
case,
in
the
duckworth
case
and
all
cases
that
were
cited
by
mr.
richards,
were
all
commercial
transportation
say
150
cases,
a
thousand
cases
of
liquors
such
as
that.
the
state
in
those
instances
required
a
bond
and
they
required
a
route
designation
showing
the
route
that
they
will
pass
through
in
that
state.
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
a
reasonable
regulation
in
absence
of
any
action
by
the
federal
congress.
and
each
instance,
the
court
has
qualified
in
his
opinion
by
saying
in
absence
of
any
regulation
by
congress
and
i
think
here
we
have
the
regulation
by
congress.
the
congress
has
assumed
that
the
person
returning
from
a
foreign
country
may
bring
in
one
quart
of
liquor
free.
since
it's
an
import,
he
has
a
right
to
carry
it
to
his
destination
without
interference
from
the
state
on
the
border.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
the
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that
but
let
me
say
this
and
maybe
it
will
answer
it.
the
possession
was
illegal
because
the
tax
was
not
affixed.
we
say
the
tax
is
unconstitutional
and
not
due.
consequently,
the
possession
would
not
be
illegal.
does
that
--
does
that
answer
or
am
i
just
going
around
it
and
avoid
it?
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
the
crime
is
the
possession
of
the
unstamped
liquor
and
if
the
liquor
is
in
due,
there
is
no
crime.
i
mean
if
the
tax
is
not
due,
there
is
no
crime.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
the
possession
and
tax
are
intertwined.
there's
no
--
no
separating.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
possession
of
unstamped
liquor.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
sir?
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
sir.
he
refused
to
pay
the
tax
saying
it
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
say
the
stamp
is
unconstitutional,
yes,
sir.
and
as
unconstitutional,
he
did
not
owe
it.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
sir?
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
exactly
what
he
said.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i'm
saying
that
they
cannot
impose
this
tax.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
and
consequently
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
right.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
he
could
have
put
a
stamp
on
it.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
he
could
have
purchased
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
well,
let
me
--
let
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
what
i'm
trying
to
say
--
perhaps
may
be
this
will
get
it.
i'm
trying
to
say
that
--
that
texas
could
not
impose
the
tax
on
liquor
traveling
through
the
state
of
texas.
that
therefore
he
was
--
should
have
been
able
to
carry
that
liquor
through
the
state
of
texas
without
any
tax
being
paid
to
the
state
of
texas.
and
that
therefore,
if
they
charged
him
with
possession
of
unstamped
liquor,
they
just
can't
charge
him
with
that
particular
thing.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
--
yes,
sir,
i
recognize
that
they
have
a
regulatory
power
to
do
so.but
a
tax
and
regulation
is
--
they're
separable
in
the
collins
versus
yosemite
park
case.
the
--
this
court
said
that
such
a
tax
was
separable
from
the
regulatory
phrase
of
the
alcoholic
control
act
of
california.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
under
the
carter
case,
they
could
do
that.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
but
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
in
absence
of
federal
legislation,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now,
the
federal
government
comes
along
and
says,
“all
right,
you
as
a
private
individual
can
carry
so
much
liquor
through
the
state.”
any
state
legislation
contrary
would
be
void.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
i
think
this
court
has
interpreted.
it
could
mean
delivery
and
use
theory
and
not
in
transit.
i
think
in
the
yellow
cab
company
--
yellow
cab
transit
company
case
about
transporting
liquor
through
the
state
of
oklahoma
to
the
military
reservation
at
fort
sill.
they
said
that
they
could
do
that.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
there
again,
government
has
power
over
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
exactly
what
i'm
contending.
the
government
has
the
power
over
the
export
and
import
business
and
if
the
individual
state
cannot
vary
the
uniformity
for
the
whole
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
correct.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
government
by
the
export-import
clause
has
complete
control.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
well,
that's
my
contention
that
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
my
contention
that
the
--
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
repeal
the
export-import
clause.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
it
would
have
--
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
it
would
have
to
be
by
implication
only.
it
does
not
say
we
also
repeal
the
export-import
clause
or
control
of
--
of
foreign
commerce.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
because
the
individual
state
has
a
control
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
of
the
liquor
within
its
boundaries.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
but
it
is
going
through
the
state
of
texas.
it
is
my
contention.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
if
--
if
this
court
should
construe.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
because
of
the
regulation
or
the
--
the
--
or
the
regulation,
not
regulation,
but
that
the
legislation
by
congress.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
then
if
that
--
if
that
didn't
cover
it
and
the
export-import
clause
did
not
cover
it
then
i
would
be
out,
yes
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
to
control
within
the
state
border
and
so
far
as
the
possession
or
--
i
mean
as
insofar
as
use
or
delivering
in
that
state
is
concerned,
no
they
could
not.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
right.
but
he
it
did
not
repeal
the
export-import
clause
and
didn't
repeal
the
foreign
commerce
clause
under
which
congress
has
acted.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
that's
correct.
may
i
emphasize
that
--
that
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
defendant
if
he
had
pay
the
tax,
there
would
been
no
regulation
other
than
that.
that
is
--
i'm
not
stipulating
but
uncontroverted
in
the
--
in
the
statement
of
facts
that
if
he
had
paid
the
tax,
he
could
have
gone
on
his
way.
there
was
no
question
of
a
permit
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
as
to
whether
they
have
permit
or
not.
there
was
no
question
on
that.
they
seem
to
think
that
that
came
into
it.
what
we
were
attacking
the
entire
thing
on
the
tax
base
only,
not
as
a
regulatory
measure
but
a
revenue
raising
tax
omission.
i
think
if
you'll
check
our
liquor
control
act,
article
666,
the
same
is
used
for
revenue
production.
i
think
perhaps
my
brief
has
cited
this
cases
and
i
think
they
are
pertinent
and
will
bear
me
out
that
there
is
a
definite
separation
of
powers
that
should
be
maintained.
let
me
--
let
me
give
this
one
instance
and
then
i'll
quit.
for
instance,
if
the
state
of
texas
on
tax
decided
to
go
in
and
tax
scotch
whiskey
at
the
rate
of
$10
a
quart,
all
the
imports
from
--
from
mexico
tax
scotch
whiskey
at
$10
a
quart.
no
tax
for
rum.
they
would
be
affecting
the
general
right
of
the
congress
to
control
the
import-export
industry.
they
would
be
affecting
it
locally,
just
as
definitely
as
if
they
had
gone
in
to
say,
you
can't
bring
in
rum
but
you
can
bring
in
scotch
or
you
can
bring
in
(inaudible)
or
you
might
bring
in
(inaudible).
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
as
long
as
it's
going
through
their
state
to
a
final
destination
and
is
an
import,
it
is
without
the
bounds
of
the
state's
regulatory
powers
or
taxing
powers.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
r.
stewart
and
i
think
--
i
think
under
article
666-23a
(1)
that
they
have
the
right
to
carry
it
through
the
state.
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
