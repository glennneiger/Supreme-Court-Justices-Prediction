what
is

which
is
the

here?
the

(voice

not

bols?
justice
charles

it
was
determined
not
taxed
or
failure
to
pay
a
tax
but
merely
--
justice
charles

whittaker
possession
only?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
contrary
to
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
because
he
had
failed
to
pay
in
taxes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
richards,
i'm
troubled
by
one
thing
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
maybe
you
can
help
me.
you
have
stated
that
this
fine
imposed
upon
petitioner
was
not
for
failure
to
pay
a
tax
but
for
merely
having
possession
which
was
illegal
under
the
local
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
the
petitioner
then,
getting
down
to
this
particular
case,
guilty
of
the
offense
charged
in
the
information
which
says
that
he
had
in
--
in
his
possession,
a
rum,
both
now
in
the
container
to
which
no
tax
stamps
showing
the
payment
of
the
tax
on
said
beverage
due
to
state
of
texas
was
affixed
and
to
which
so
unstamped
container,
is
this
literally
being
read,
no
valid
evidence
was
affixed
showing
a
payment
of
the
tax
on
such
beverage
due
to
the
state
of
texas
and
the
tax
stamp
was
then
and
there
required
by
the
laws
of
texas
to
be
affixed
to
such
container
and
the
tax
on
such
beverage
was
then
and
there
due
to
the
state
of
texas
and
the
tax
imposed
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
on
such
illicit
beverage
had
not
been
paid
all
against
the
piece
of
dignity
of
the
state.
now
--
and
the
question,
isolating
our
attention
to
this
particular
case,
does
this
information
charge
a
violation
of
the
law?in
this
particular
case,
says
he
is
guilty
because
he
failed
to
pay
the
tax,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
this
information?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
he
couldn't
have
got
the
stamps.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
--
for
one
gallon.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
didn't
need
it
for
one
gallon.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
needed
no
stamp.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
with
that
one
quart?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
could
he
get
stamps?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
stewart.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
have
you
to
say
in
respect
to
justice
frankfurter's
question
put
to
mr.
richards
that
if
this
fine
was
--
find
him
guilty
and
was
made
and
the
fine
imposed
upon
a
wrong
ground,
namely,
refusal
to
pay
a
tax,
not
mainly
for
possession
--
no,
the
other
way
around,
refusal
to
pay
a
tax
when
it
should
have
been
on
possession
that
such
as
inadequate
state
ground
decision
and
we
have
no
jurisdiction.
if
--
in
other
words,
if
the
state
--
if
the
actual
ground
of
the
conviction
was
possession
though
you
charged
something
else
and
the
conviction
was
had,
would
we
have
jurisdiction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
actually,
the
statute
as
argued
by
mr.
richards
makes
the
crime
to
consist
of
possession
alone
without
the
payment.
let
me
see
