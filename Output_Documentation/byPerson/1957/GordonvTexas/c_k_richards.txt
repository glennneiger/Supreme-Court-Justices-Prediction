mr.
c.
k.
richards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
make
a
statement
at
the
outset
the
chief
justice
has
come
to
the
question
as
to
whether
it
was
conceded
that
he
was
going
to
--
the
appellant
was
going
to
use
this
for
his
own
use.
the
state
concedes
nothing.
the
record
shows
that
the
appellant
did
make
the
statement
that
he
and
his
companions,
that
is
wife
and
daughter
had
purchased
this
11
galloon
bottles
in
mexico
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
it
through
the
state
of
texas
for
his
personal
use
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
that
he
did
not
intend
to
use,
sell
or
otherwise
dispose
of
it
in
the
state
of
texas
but
we
will
not
concede
that
he
could
not
have
done
so.
he
--
that
was
his
statement
that
he
made.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
there
was
no
evidence
to
sustain
his
contention
either
because
i
--
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
he
never
got
the
chance.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
was
his
testimony
which
is
uncontroverted
and
i
fail
to
see
how
anybody
could
controvert
it,
unless
he
had
the
opportunity
to
--
to
transport
it.
now,
our
contention
is
briefly
this,
and
i
will
concede
at
the
offset
that
had
this
whiskey
had
been
purchased
in
mexico,
it
could
be
transported
through
the
state
of
texas
after
it
came
to
the
port
of
entry
into
the
state
of
north
carolina
without
the
payment
of
the
tax
in
interstate
commerce
if
he
had
complied
with
the
regulations
that
the
state
of
texas
has
set
up
under
the
liquor
control
act.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
about
getting
a
permit,
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
he
was
stopped
there
at
the
bridge
and
when
that
liquor
was
being
declared
at
the
customs
office,
assuming
that
he
was
traveling
in
private
conveyance,
which
he
was,
he
could
call
the
customs
broker.
but
customs
broker
pointed
up
--
put
up
a
bond
and
transport
it
by
a
common
carrier
which
is
also
under
bond
from
the
port
of
entry
to
his
home
in
north
carolina.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
couldn't
tell
you
what
it
would
cost
him,
your
honor,
but
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
mr.
chief
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
--
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
at
the
outset,
i
never
did
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question.
there
is
no
way
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
that
liquor
can
be
transported
in
a
private
automobile
through
the
state
of
texas
and
interstate
commerce.
that
has
been
definitely
decided
for
the
reason
that
there
is
no
permit
which
an
individual
can
get
to
transport
intoxicating
liquor
in
private
automobile.
in
fact,
this
court
had
before
if
not
so
very
long
ago,
the
case
of
cartlidge
versus
rainey
from
the
fifth
circuit
which
involve
the
transportation
from
the
state
of
arkansas
through
the
state
of
texas
and
to
the
state
of
oklahoma
of
a
private
automobile
loaded
down
to
the
gunnels
with
various
bottles
of
intoxicating
liquor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
in
the
end
--
in
this
individual
case?
no,
sir.
not
according
to
my
theory
which
i'll
try
to
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
would
have
to
leave
the
liquor
there.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
pardon?
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
could
get
it
across
by
getting
a
customs
broker
before
it
entered
texas
to
put
it
in
bond,
deliver
it
to
a
common
carrier
who's
also
under
bond
and
then
it
should
go
in
interstate
commerce
to
its
destination.
they
would
be
no
custom's
duty
if
it
was
exempt.
he
would
of
course
have
to
pay
the
customs
broker's
fee
and
the
common
carrier's
fee.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
he
would
be
exempt
from
tax.
no,
your
honor.
it's
specifically
provided
in
the
--
any
person
authorized
to
export
liquor
from
the
state
and
having
liquor
intended
for
shipment
from
one
place
to
a
point
outside
must
keep
it
in
a
separate
compartment.
they
gave
them
a
little
sort
of
a
--
let's
say
fare
or
passport
which
shows
that
that
is
intended
for
export
and
no
tax
is
due
thereon.
the
tax
is
a
possessory
or
used
tax.
it
is
not
a
duty.
it
is
for
possession
or
used
--
or
use
in
the
state
now.
to
continue
my
answer,
that
is
the
only
way
that
i
know
that
this
liquor
could
be
transported
by
the
individual
who
is
coming
in
to
the
customs
and
having
it
for
his
own
personal
use
could
bring
it
to
the
state
of
texas.
there
is
no
provision
for
making
bond.
the
legislature
did
not
see
fit
to
do
it.
now,
the
legislature
did
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
by
an
individual,
yes,
your
honor
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
fee
or
any
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
well,
the
--
there's
a
provision
in
the
law
that
one
--
one
quart
not
to
exceed
one
quart
may
be
imported
into
the
state
of
texas,
brought
into
the
state
of
texas
but
the
stamp,
the
tax
must
be
paid
and
the
stamp
to
fix.
now,
the
last
legislature
changed
that
so
that
non-residence
of
texas
could
bring
in
not
to
exceed
for
a
quart.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
is
the
sole
exemption.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
and
could
not
keep
the
liquor,
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
the
mental
processes
of
some
of
these
agents
of
the
texas
liquor
control
board.
i
do
know
that
the
law
says
that
the
--
in
there
at
least
the
way
they
concede
--
construe
it,
if
you
have
liquor
in
the
state
of
texas
to
which
no
stamp
has
been
affixed,
no
tax
paid,
it
is
an
illegal
beverage
except
that
is
all
that
which
is
in
excess
of
one
quart.
therefore,
he's
subject
to
seizure.
now,
if
he
had
brought
one
quart
in
there
and
has
refused
to
pay
the
tax,
he
might
be
confronted
with
a
different
situation
but
he
had
exceeded.
he
and
his
two
companions
each
exceeded
the
allotment
for
personal
use.
he
said
it
was
brought
in
for
personal
use.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
nothing
would
have
been
done
if
each
one
had
kept
one
bottle.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
they
would
have
to
pay
--
the
tax
is
levied
on
the
fact
that
it
was
--
it
was
illegally
possessed.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
is
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
because
they
--
it
would
be
unlawful
for
him
to
transport.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
there
is
no
provision,
your
honor.
that
is
judicial
--
judicial
interpretation.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
can
refer
you
to
a
case
of
bols
versus
state.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
bol,
b-o-l.
they
are
cited
in
my
brief
at
--
glancing
on
page
5.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
132,
also
the
case
of
chalmers
versus
state,
216
s.w.
2d
203.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
which
is
the
court
of
last
--
last
resort.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
now,
in
--
the
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
matter
what
he
pay.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
still
could
not
have
taken
it,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
would
still
be
subject
to
fine
because
he
had
imported
more
than
the
exempted
provision.
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
the
tax
incidentally
is
a
regulatory
tax
primarily.
now,
the
taxes
are
divided
in
two
sections.
i
have
not
cited
those
in
my
brief
because
i
--
although
i
should
have.
i
will
admit
that
i
was
in
error
not
so
doing.
we
have
the
permit
fees,
the
license
fees.
those
are
solely
a
revenue
measures.
they
go
one-fourth
for
the
permanent
school
fund
and
three-fourth
to
the
old
age
assistance.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
for
the
wholesalers,
the
retailers,
the
position
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
the
people
in
business.
i'm
sure
in
case
of
an
occupation
of
dealing
with
it.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
the
--
this
tax
which
is
denominated
as
a
sales
tax
but
which
is
in
fact
a
possession
or
used
tax.
it
is
primarily
regulatory
tax
and
after
the
expenses
of
the
enforcement
of
the
liquor
control
act
have
been
--
that
which
the
legislature
choose
to
appropriate
for
that
purpose
have
been
expended
and
then
the
balance
goes
into
the
general
fund
and
maybe
used
for
other
purposes.
i
think
that
there's
an
allocation,
one-fourth
additional
of
that
for
the
school
fund.
the
tax
is
generally
--
the
stamp
is
generally
fixed
by
the
retailer
in
the
package
store
before
he
sells
it.
and
to
that
extent,
it's
a
sales
tax
but
if
i
bring
it
in
from
arkansas
as
in
the
case
of
chalmers.
he
brought
them
from
louisiana.
he
brought
it
in
with
the
united
--
with
the
federal
stamp
attached,
the
louisiana
stamp
attached.
but
no
texas
stamp
so
it
was
seized.
he
didn't
have
a
permit
to
transport
it
within
the
state
of
texas
in
private
automobile.
that
is
a
case
in
bols
versus
state.
now,
there
is
an
old
case,
horton
versus
state
where
the
man
had
in
his
possession,
not
quite
a
quart,
and
under
the
law
before
it
was
amended,
you
were
allowed
to
import
one
quart
in
without
the
payment
of
any
tax.
that
law
was
later
on
amended
and
required
with
the
proviso
that
provide
the
tax
be
paid
and
the
stamp
be
affixed.
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
he
is
--
the
court
under
the
--
within
the
exempt
of
provision.
he
was
not
guilty
of
any
offense.
in
other
words,
the
states
contention
in
here
is
bottomed
on
effect
the
--
if
the
importer
had
brought
this
in
as
an
import
to
be
transported
in
interstate
commerce
any
tax
that
we
would
attempt
to
levy
upon
him
would
be
void.
it
would
plainly
be
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
but
the
amount
that
he
brought
in
made
itself
ipso
facto
contraband
and
the
fact
that
he
had
possession
of
it
and
could
not
get
a
permit
to
transport
in
--
in
interstate
commerce
to
north
carolina.
it
was
still
contraband.
therefore,
it
was
subject
to
the
tax.
that
is
on
the
basis
of
his
possession.
he
had
it
in
there
illegally.
now,
that
is
the
gist
of
the
state's
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
it
is
a
fine
for
the
possession
of
unstamped
liquor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
sir.
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
in
a
way
it
is.
it's
a
--
it's
a
tax
on
the
possession
of
unstamped
liquor.
you
might
say
it's
a
fine.
it
might
be
a
civil
fine
as
opposed
to
the
criminal
penalty
of
the
$100
for
having
possession
of
it.
there's
a
criminal
penalty
for
transporting
or
having
in
your
possession
any
illegal
beverages.
this
is
an
illegal
beverage
because
it's
not
stamped.
i
realize
the
fact
that
what
your
honor
i
think
his
question
direct
to
me
is
why
--
why
catch
an
illegal
beverage.
well,
the
possession
of
an
illegal
beverage
i
think
is
always
been
subject
to
a
tax.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
have
the
citation
right
with
me
but
prior
to
the
--
or
during
the
prohibition
here,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
have
what
they
call
the
floor
tax
for
the
possession
of
beverages
which
was
illegal
to
possess.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
that
was
a
criminal
trial,
your
honor.
the
--
the
tax
--
he
didn't
--
he
had
not
paid
the
possessory
tax.
if
he
paid
the
possessory
tax,
he
could
not
have
been
prosecuted.
he
was
prosecuted
for
the
possession
of
unstamped
liquor
which
is
an
illicit
beverage.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
if
--
for
the
possession
only.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
for
the
possession
only.
they
--
if
you'll
recall,
the
counsel
said
that
he
--
they
took
him
back
to
the
bridge
again
and
offered
him
the
opportunity
to
pay
the
tax
which
he
refused
standing
on
his
--
what
he
alleged
to
be
his
constitutional
rights.
so
then,
he
was
arrested.
the
liquor
was
confiscated
and
he
was
tried
before
a
jury.
and
the
issues
were
submitted.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
the
possession
of
--
of
11
gallons
of
unstamped
liquor
which
is
a
possession
of
an
illegal
beverage.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
contrary
to
law,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
that
if
he
--
no,
not
after
the
--
he
couldn't
have
purged
himself
after
the
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
don't
think
that
was
necessary.
he
had
the
opportunity
and
he
stood
on
his
alleged
constitutional
rights.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
pardon
me?
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
the
whole
texas
liquor
control
act
is
based
on
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
have
not
--
i
am
trying
to
read
all
the
cases
that
this
opinion,
this
court
has
written
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
that
question
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
there
are
not
many
cases
on
the
tax
question.
i
think
the
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
i
think
it
does,
definitely.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
sir.
your
honor,
i
--
i
have
cite
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
carter
--
carter
case.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
there
is
a
case
which
was
just
--
which
were
decided
on
october
29th
by
the
tenth
circuit
murphy
versus
love
which
according
to
gossip
will
eventually
reach
this
court.
there's
a
divided
court
there,
however,
that
was
not
directly
on
this
point.
it
brings
into
effect
the
--
into
play
the
amendment
and
the
federal
enclave
at
fort
leavenworth,
kansas.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
is
familiar
with
it
or
not
or
whether
the
court
would
care
to
have
me
discuss
it
or
not.
well,
it
does
bear
on
it
to
--
to
an
--
in
a
certain
degree.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor,
definitely
that
is
the
basis
of
the
cartlidge
versus
rainey,
the
duckworth
case
and
the
ziffrin
case.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
my
–-
i
don't
know
whether
i
follow
your
honor's
question.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
would
say
that
it
did.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
would
say
that
it
did,
definitely.
i
think
that
the
power
which
is
the
legislature
is
delegated
to
the
liquor
control
board
under
the
liquor
control
act
is
definitely
a
product
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
it
was
the
intention
of
the
legislature,
i
think,
to
prevent
any
liquor
from
being
brought
into
the
state
of
texas
from
--
for
use
or
sale
or
dispose
of
unless
it
came
to
the
proper
channels
and
unless
a
tax
had
been
paid.
now,
as
it
happens
at
the
--
usually
the
tax
is
affixed
by
the
retailer
to
the
bottle
before
the
sold
to
the
purchaser.
that's
in
a
package
store
and
the
package
stores
are
the
only
ones
who
have
the
right
to
sell
liquor
in
the
original
package.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
as
much
as
you
can
pay
for
i
think.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no
limit.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
you
--
except
that
it
cannot
be
transported
from
a
wet
area
to
a
dry
area.
that
is
the
section
which
counsel
quoted
666-23
(a).
it
can
be
transported
from
a
place
where
it's
authorized
to
be
sold
to
another
place
where
it's
authorized
to
be
used
which
would
be
from
one
wet
county
to
another
one,
but
it
can't
be
transported
from
a
wet
county
and
to
a
dry
county.
if
it
is,
it's
subject
to
seizure,
stamped
or
unstamped.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor,
without
the
payment
of
a
tax.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
that
there
is
a
provision
that
a
contract
carrier
may.we
have
a
difference
in
--
in
automobile
carriers.
we
have
what's
called
a
common
carrier.
we
have
specialized
carriers
and
we
have
a
contract
carrier.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
now,
i
can
read
if
your
honor
will
permit
me,
i
can
read
the
definition
of
carrier.
the
word
carrier
when
used
in
this
section
shall
mean
and
include
water
carriers,
airplane
lines.
all
steam,
electric
motor
power
railway
carriers
and
common
carrier
and
motor
carriers
operating
under
(inaudible)
convinced
necessity
issued
by
the
railroad
commission
of
texas
or
by
certificates
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
holders
of
such
certificates
shall
be
authorized
to
transport
liquor
into
and
out
of
the
state
and
points
within
this
--
and
between
points
within
the
state.
such
carrier
shall
furnish
such
information
concerning
the
transportation
of
liquor
as
maybe
required
by
the
board.
the
annual
state
fee
for
carrier
permits
should
be
$5.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
now,
that
--
that
differs
from
the
ziffrin
case
and
that
a
common
carrier
holding
the
certificate
from
the
federal
--
under
the
federal
motor
carrier
act
doesn't
have
to
get
a
state
permit.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
definite.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
not
on
a
tax
basis,
no.
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
on
the
tax
basis.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
the
carriage
to
the
state
to
prevent
it
from
being
--
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
there
is
a
provision
for
these
carriers
to
separate
the
interstate
shipment
from
the
state
shipment.
they're
kept
in
separate
compartments.
the
idea
being
that
the
common
carriers
are
responsible.
they
are
under
bond
and
they
can't
drop
off
into
dry
area
and
there
are
quite
a
number
of
dry
areas
in
the
state
of
texas,
kind
of
15
cases
which
can
be
use
and
even
though
the
tax
has
been
paid.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
oh,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
as
far
as
the
export-import
feature
is
concerned.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
can
bring
a
quart
not
to
exceed
one
quart.
now
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
not
necessarily.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
can
carry
it
all
the
way
through
and
that
quite
frequently
is
done.
that
quite
frequently
is
done.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
in
excess
of
one
quart.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
on
--
with
a
permit.
yes,
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
he
could.
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
he
could
do
so.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
provided
with
stamp,
of
course
it
would
be
stamped
if
he
bought
it
from
a
package
store.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
$5.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
purely
a
regular
store.
the
--
the
entire
scheme
of
the
liquor
control
act
is
regulation.
i
might
state
that
it
is
--
as
counsel
said
there
are
several
features
in
there
that
seem
to
contradict
themselves.
but
this
law
was
compromised
between
the
wet
and
the
dry
thought.
it's
a
--
it's
a
sort
of
a
hybrid.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
as
i
read
the
law
and
as
i've
just
stated
to
the
court,
i
--
the
law
is
rather
next
step.
the
illicit
beverage
is
defined
in
666-3
(a)
which
is
on
page
16
of
the
appendix.
the
illicit
beverages
shall
mean
and
refer
to
any
alcoholic
beverages
possessed
imported
or
transported
in
violation
in
this
act
or
on
which
any
tax
imposed
to
the
laws
of
the
state
has
not
been
paid
and
the
tax
stamped
affixed
thereto.
now,
no
person
shall
import
into
the
state
any
liquor
in
excess
of
one
quart
from
any
source
unless
a
permit
be
first
obtained
from
the
board
and
any
person
so
purchasing
or
importing
liquor
in
violation
in
this
section
shall
be
subject
to
penalties
here
and
after
provide.
and
here
comes
the
carriers.
now,
for
tax
purposes
only,
this
is
666-1732,
protects
purposes
on
a
distilled
spirits
contained
in
the
container
having
attached
thereto
the
federal
liquor
strip
stamp
or
imported
from
any
foreign
country.
i
hereby
subject
to
trans
--
to
taxation
and
must
have
affixed
thereto
the
appropriate
texas
tax
stamp
for
the
distilled
spirits.
now,
that's
for
tax
purposes
only.
first,
they
say
that
the
illicit
beverage
is
one
which
is
possessed
which
doesn't
have
the
tax
stamp
on
it.
and
subsequently,
they
say
that
anything
that
is
imported
from
a
foreign
country
must
have
the
tax
stamp
on
it
and
if
it
doesn't
have
the
tax
stamp
on
it
then
its
contraband.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
is
true.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
can't
get
it.
now,
that
--
if
the
--
the
indictment
or
the
information
here
does
not
specify
the
number
of
quart,
it
says
he
had
in
his
possession
out
and
the
illicit
beverage
as
defined
under
the
act.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
--
that
the
tax
had
not
been
paid.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
it
was
subject
to
tax.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
under
the
information,
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
he
could
have
got
one
stamp.
he
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
he
could
not
have
get
--
i
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
it
would
seem
as
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
as
i
say,
your
honor,
the
meeting
place
upon
this
by
the
agents
of
the
liquor
control
board
is
that
everything
inside
has
got
to
have
a
stamp
on
it
willy-nilly
that
it
--
i
fail
to
see
any
reason
why
the
--
anything
in
excess
of
one
quart
to
each
person
was
not
the
imported
if
provided
it
was
not
in
interstate
commerce
in
violation
along
with
subject
to
seizure.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
if
he
puts
a
stamp.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
he
would
be
--
i
think
your
honor,
i
think
he
would
be
prohibited
by
law
from
possessing
more
than
one
quart
which
is
imported
from
mexico
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
--
or
any
--
any
state
of
the
--
the
united
states.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
would
have
needed
stamps,
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no
--
yes,
sir,
that
would
have
needed
stamps
also.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
that
he
could.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
period,
yes.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
exactly
my
contention.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no,
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
i
have
answered
--
attempted
to
answer
in
the
state's
brief
is
that
it's
not
an
export-import
tax
and
it
wasn't
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
--
it's
not
an
interstate
commerce
and
that's
all
the
sufficiency
of
the
information.
it
has
never
been
great.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
isn't
before,
no,
your
honor.
now,
in
six
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
no.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
it
was
still
liquor
if
it
exceeded
the
alcoholic
content
that
was
required
to
the
tax.
now
the
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
--
in
answer
to
--
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
666-23a
(4)
it
provides
--
it
is
provided
that
any
person
may
bring
into
this
state
not
more
than
one
quart
of
liquor
for
his
own
personal
use.
that's
the
way
the
law
used
to
be.
then
they
added
this,
provided
further
that
he
shall
pay
and
affix
thereto
the
required
state
tax
stamps.
now,
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom,
the
last
session
i
think,
has
increased
i
don't
know
whether
i
stated
this
before
or
not,
has
increased
the
--
the
amount
allowable
to
a
non-resident
of
texas
to
four
quarts.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
that
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
think
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
i
hardly
believe
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it's
been
the
price
that
the
(voice
overlap)
there
and
it
hurts
the
chambers
of
commerce
that
the
people
coming
to
texas,
they
prefer
to
go
to
some
other
state
where
that
--
port
of
entry
where
that
doesn't
affect
it.
mr.
c.
k.
richards
well,
tijuana
is
still
with
us
and
i
think
there
are
ports
of
entry
in
new
mexico,
i
think
it's
very
small
and
there
are
two
in
arizona,
douglas
and
nogales.
what
--
they
require
that
military
personnel,
this
amendment
requires
that
military
personnel
stationed
in
texas
are
restricted
to
one
quart
only.
military
personnel
living
outside
the
state
or
outside
the
state
of
texas
may
bring
in
four
quarts.
this
whole
texas
liquor
control
act
is
a
--
is
a
product
of
trial
and
error
so
to
speak.
it's
amended
that
every
session
in
the
legislature
one
way
or
another
depending
on
the
amount
of
pressure
brought
by
the
various
forces.
briefly,
in
order
to
conclude
my
argument,
i
don't
think
that
any
of
the
cases
cited
by
counsel
for
the
appellant
or
after
the
board,
i
think
all
the
export-import
tax
cases
i
think
it's
good
--
they're
a
good
law
but
they're
all
ad
valorem
cases.
and
there's
no
question
that
the
findings
of
the
court
particularly
in
that
(inaudible)
case.
that
was
where
the
liquor
was
being
assembled
from
outside
of
california,
came
to
rest
in
the
warehouse
for
export
to
the
hawaiian
islands.they
attempted
to
let
the
ad
valorem
tax
on
it.
a
great
question
before
the
court
was
there
whether
that
had
come
to
rest
and
not
to
--
a
tax
could
be
--
would
attach.
(inaudible)
case
with
the
converse
of
that,
that
was
importation
into
california
and
again
there
was
the
ad
valorem
tax.
to
my
mind,
the
carter
case
is
--
and
the
duckworth
cases
are
in
our
support.
the
jamison
case
that
counsel
cited
was
a
case
that
arose
under
the
read
amendment
which
was
purely
against
the
transportation
from
dry
to
wet
state.
the
man
had
five
quarts
and
he
was
transporting
it
by
a
private
automobile.
the
matter
that
was
before
this
court
seemed
to
be
that
he
said
that
those
were
of
his
own
personal
use
and
the
court's
majority
opinion
said
that
it
was
immaterial
whether
it's
his
personal
use
or
not.
and
mr.
justice
clark,
not
the
present
mr.
justice
clark,
but
his
predecessor,
dissented,
stating
that
he
thought
that
since
it
was
for
his
personal
use,
that
it
was
excluded
from
the
commerce
clause,
it's
the
commerce
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
was
--
that
was
--
mr.
c.
k.
richards
that
was
a
pre-twenty-first
amendment
case.
we
--
i
fail
to
find
any
cases.
our
case
here
is
bottomed
on
this
cartlidge
versus
rainey
that
the
transportation
was
illegal.
that
is
he
couldn't
go
to
texas,
therefore
it
was
contraband.
now,
the
fact
that
--
i
think
the
state
of
texas
should
afford
some
relief
to
a
person
who
is
coming
through
as
a
bona
fide
tourist
and
intends
that
for
his
own
personal
use.
the
fact
is
the
legislature
is
not
seemed
fit
to
do
it
except
for
these
one
and
now
four
quart
exemption.
we
think
that
the
conviction
being
for
the
possession
of
an
illegal
beverage,
the
illegal
beverage
being
that
which
is
not
stamped.
and
since
it
was
not
in
interstate
commerce,
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
