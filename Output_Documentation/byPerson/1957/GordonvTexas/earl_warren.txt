number
71,
i.
n.
gordon,
appellant
versus
state
of
texas.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
passed
on
--
it
passed
on
the
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
a
state
concede
that
all
you
were
doing
was
carrying
it
through
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
undisputed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
act
purports
to
apply
to
coming
into
the
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
any
other
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
state
have
any
--
does
the
state
have
any
kind
of
a
permit
that
will
enable
the
person
to
carry
liquor
through
the
state
in
bonds
so
to
speak
or
there
is
nothing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
if
a
person
--
if
a
person
let's
say
was
destined
for
new
mexico,
he
came
into
the
border
as
--
as
your
client
did
with
a
truckload
of
liquor
and
was
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
it
through
to
new
mexico,
not
a
public
carrier
but
his
own
--
his
own
truck
and
cleared
that
the
--
at
the
border
and
start
to
go
through
to
new
mexico.
is
there
no
way
that
the
state
provides
for
that
man
to
protect
himself
against
this
--
this
tax
or
would
he
have
to
pay
the
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
a
permit
would
he
get?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
maybe
he
wasn't
--
maybe
he
was
neither
of
those
--
maybe
he
wanted
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
maybe
he
wanted
to
take
it
to
his
home
in
--in
new
mexico,
let
us
say,
and
he
came
to
the
border
with
this
truckload
of
liquors.
how
would
he
--
or
would
he
have
to
pay
the
tax
of
texas
or
is
there
any
kind
of
permit
that
the
state
issues
that
will
enable
him
to
go
through
the
state
without
having
to
pay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
something
--
anything
like
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
believe
what?
will
he
have
to
pay
it
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
what
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
richards.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
richards.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
stewart,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
richards
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
without
the
payment
of
the
tax
if
he
gets
--
if
he
pay
his
tax.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
in
other
words,
this
man
had
paid
$1.40
a
gallon
on
his
11
bottles,
he
still
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
is
the
limit,
mr.
richards
if
they
sell
on
those
package
stores?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
limit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
limit
on
how
--
how
it's
transported?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
richards,
suppose
--
suppose
a
man
went
to
--
to
one
of
your
store,
one
of
your
package
store
and
you
said
there
was
no
limit
on
what
he
could
buy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
could
buy
a
whole
truckload
if
he
wants.suppose
he
bought
a
truckload
and
transport
it
through
the
state
as
long
as
he
didn't
go
into
a
dry
territory
which
you
speak
of,
he
could
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
get
through
the
state
analysis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
other
question
i'd
like
to
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
one
other
question
i'd
like
to
ask
you
is
that
--
that
permit
that
you
spoke
of
that
goes
to
common
carriers
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
so
forth.
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
cost
of
that
permit
is
only
$5.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
purely
a
regular
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
fact
--
what
is
the
law
rather
if
he
had
paid
the
tax?
do
you
contend
that
he
could
have
transported
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
do
with
the
twenty-first
amendment?
