coming
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
the
statute
permitting
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
see
if
i
fully
understand
that
(inaudible)
of
your
law
as
a
regulatory
measure
for
a
judgment
of
twenty-first
amendment.
i
understand
that
liquor
can
be
transported
through
the
state
if
certain
authorized
(inaudible)
transported.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
extend
beyond
recognized
common
carriers
such
as
a
railroad
or
a
trucking
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
--
what
i
was
wondering
was,
has
the
state
of
texas
set
up
for
itself
a
new
category
of
carrier
if
they
need
certain
qualification
of
texas
and
transport
it
through
the
state
and
interstate
commerce
or
does
that
merely
apply
for
a
recognized
common
carrier
to
the
now
existing
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
the
(inaudible)
of
the
regulation
of
the
state
seeks
to
interpose
(inaudible)
interstate
commerce
insofar
as
attempting
to
limit
transportation
through
the
state
to
the
recognized
common
carrier.
justice

that
is
not
on
a
tax
basis
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
regulating
the
carriage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
of
texas
evidently
claimed
as
i
understand
the
(inaudible)
its
power
to
do
that
under
the
court
--
the
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
rather
than

and
admits
that
the
related
issues
or
something
else
that
--
that
regulation
would
be
permitted
by
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
apply
to
the
extent
that
--
i
am
a
little
mixed
up
on
the
point
so
far.
i
understand
now
that
they're
going
to
take
the

it
has
to
be
done
by
common
carriers.
suppose
a
man
just
want
to
drive
to
texas.
can
he
bring
liquor
--
a
bottle
of
liquor
in

justice
hugo
l.
black
he
have
to
drink
it
while
he's
there
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can
carry
it
all
the
way
through.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
what
you
have
is
a
prohibition
against
transporting
liquors
through
the
state
of
texas
in
excess
of
one
quart.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
unless,
it
is
transported
through
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
would
probably
argue
that
it's
against
the
law
of
whatever
liquor
in
texas
that's
not
stamped
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
would
say
that
it
doesn't
excuse
a
man
of
that
violation
to
prove
on
his
part
that
he
can't
establish
because
he's
cared
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
got
any
doubt
(inaudible)
it's
not
in
the
question
raised
that
this
liquor
didn't
have
to
be
taxed
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
still
liquor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
argument
of
that?
i
want
to
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
people
from
outside
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
more
liquor
than
people
in
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
didn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
didn't,
he
still
had
possession
of
unstamped
liquor
and
that's
a
crime
in
that
state,
can
he
defend
by
saying
(inaudible)
has
no
right.
i
didn't
have
to
pay
and
put
a
stamp.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
can
make
it
against
the
law
on
that
state
if
they
have
possession
of
unstamped
liquor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
had
--
he
had
liquor
that
was
not
stamped.
suppose
--
let's
say
it's
a
surplusage
if
you
want,
they
--
they
could
have
simply
charge
him
with
having
possession
of
unstamped
liquor
which
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.

and
suppose
that
--
that's
what
they
do,
charge
him
with
having
possession
of
unstamped
liquor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
that
not
make
it
a
crime
and
what
difference
does
it
make
because
he
could
have
put
a
stamp
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
does
it
make
if
he
could
have
and
he
didn't
have
(inaudible)
and
he
had
possession
of
unstamped
liquor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
texas
is
barred
from

of
making
that
a
crime
and
i
should
think
if
they
visit
the
virginia
case
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
--
what
you're
saying
in
(inaudible)
it's
a
state
contention
without
power
even
since
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
limit
the
transportation
of
liquor
through
their
--
through
their
(inaudible)
to
common
carriers
if
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
wrong
(inaudible)
if
you're
wrong
in
citing
that
texas
is
without
power
put
on
this
regulation
inside
the
case
then
to
(inaudible)
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
leaves
texas
free
to
limit
the
shipment
of
liquor
through
texas,
the
common
carriers
then
you
are
out
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
then
you
will
have
to
expose
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
congress
has
the
power
to
say
now
to
pass
liquor
legislation
just
take

take
away
from
the
state's
power
given
from
the

in

insofar
as
the

then
why
couldn't
they
say
that's
under
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
hugo

you're
limiting
your
state

i
see,
you're
limiting
your
statement

the

you
made
that

can
carry
it
