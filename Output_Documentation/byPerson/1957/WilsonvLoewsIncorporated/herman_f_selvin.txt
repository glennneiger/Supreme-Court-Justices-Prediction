mr.
herman
f.
selvin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
now
clear
here
as
it
was
in
both
the
trial
court
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
below
that
this
action
was
and
is
a
common
law
tort
action
characterized
by
judge
kenny
only
this
morning,
as
a
tort
action
seeking
relief
for
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
as
at
page
11
of
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioners
concede,
the
state
of
california
had
no
connection
whatever,
had
taken
no
action
in
respect
of
the
conduct,
the
combination
or
agreement
which
it
is
alleged
here
is
unlawful
until
a
judgment
of
its
court
dismissing
the
complaint
was
entered.
their
entire
constitutional
argument
is
premised
not
on
the
fact
that
in
some
way
the
california
court,
in
this
case,
denied
them
procedural
due
process,
not
on
the
fact
that
the
california
court
upheld
against
constitutional
challenge,
some
action
of
some
other
agency
or
department
of
the
state
of
california,
but
solely
and
simply
and
wholly
on
the
fact
that
by
rendering
its
judgment
of
dismissal,
the
court
deprived
these
petitioners
of
their
constitutional
rights.
i
should
think
therefore
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
some
significance
to
know
precisely
what
it
was
that
the
california
court,
the
district
court
of
appeals
to
whom
this
certiorari
runs
decided.
it
held
--
it
affirmed
the
judgment
of
dismissal
upon
one
ground
and
one
ground
alone
that
it
did
not
appear
from
the
complaint
construed
as
it
was
required
to
be
construed
under
the
california
practice
that
the
injury
claimed
by
these
petitioners
had
been
brought
about
by
or
was
the
result
of
the
challenged
combination
or
agreement
and
that's
all
there
was
to
the
decision
below.
the
court
expressly
stated
that
in
view
of
that
conclusion,
we
do
not
reach
the
other
contentions
made.
it
treated
the
case
as
a
simple
and
conventional
tort
case
decided
it
on
what
we
have
characterized
in
our
briefs
as
on
the
question
of
standing
to
sue.
they
haven't
been
hurt
for
the
combination.
they
haven't
shown
they
were
hurt
by
it
and
therefore
there
were
no
position
to
challenge
it.
now,
from
that
common
law
tort
decision,
mr.
margolis
has
argued
this
morning,
there
arises
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
in
his
view,
james
against
marinship
should
have
controlled
rather
than
the
cases
which
the
district
court
of
appeals
purported
to
follow.
now,
it
has
been
many
times
said
and
held
in
this
court
that
an
erroneous
decision
of
state
law,
even
an
inconsistent
decision
of
state
law
inconsistent
with
prior
decisions
of
a
state
raises
no
question
under
either
the
due
process
or
the
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
constitution
and
that's
for
a
very
obvious
reason
because
otherwise
this
court
would
have
power
and
jurisdiction
to
review
every
decision
of
a
state
court
on
any
and
every
subject.
mr.
margolis
says
that
the
classification
is
an
unreasonable
one.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
is
not
a
reviewable
question
here
because
he
is
complaining
not
of
a
classification
upheld
by
the
state
court
as
the
result
of
the
action
of
some
other
state
agency,
but
of
the
classification
made
by
the
court
itself
in
handing
down
this
decision.
but
the
classification
is
unreasonable
that
it
can
be
defended
within
the
broad
limits
of
classification
that
this
court
has
supported
the
states
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
what
do
the
state
do?
in
james
against
marinship
which
is
the
case
upon
which
mr.
margolis
depends,
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
a
combination
of
employers
and
a
closed
union,
a
union
which
he
excluded
colored
people
from
membership
could
not,
under
the
california
common
law,
enter
into
a
close
shop
agreement,
so
that
colored
employees
actually
employed
at
that
time
and
excluded
from
membership
in
the
union
would
loose
their
existing
employment.
that
was
the
decision
in
james
against
marinship
and
it
was
a
decision
as
matter
of
state
law.
in
our
case,
the
court
simply
held
that
persons
who
have
no
existing
employment,
who
failed
to
show
any
reasonable
prospect
of
existing
employment,
had
no
standing
to
sue
in
respect
of
a
combination
or
agreement
which
is
alleged
was
arbitrary
and
unfair.
on
the
one
--
on
the
one
hand
in
the
class
are
those
who
have
an
existing
or
established
or
reasonably
perspective
employment,
on
the
other
are
those
who
do
not.
as
to
the
first
class,
the
state
of
california
says,
“you
have
a
cause
of
action
if
you
prove
those
facts”,
as
to
the
other,
the
state
of
california
says,
“you
have
no
cause
of
action
because
you
haven't
proved
the
one
necessary
element
that
will
bring
you
over
on
the
other
class.”
and
that,
we
submit,
your
honor
is
a
reason
classification,
even
assuming
that
this
court
can
properly
consider
the
equal
protection
question
with
respect
to
the
decision
of
the
california
court
on
a
question
of
state
law.
the
court
did
not
directly
or
indirectly
or
by
any
intimation
decide
that
this
challenge
combination
was
or
was
not
lawful
either
under
state
law
or
under
federal
law.
for
all
we
know
today,
when
persons
appropriately
situated
so
as
to
be
able
to
raise
the
question,
challenge
this
combination
if
it
still
exists
in
a
california
court,
the
california
court
may
hold
that
it
is
violative
of
--
of
state
law
or
of
federal
law
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes.
we
have
the
cartwright
act
which
is
a
--
which
is
a
state
antitrust
act
and
which
is
sometimes
invoked,
it
was
never
invoked
in
this
case.
well,
the
california
court
didn't
decide
this
constitutional
questions,
didn't
have
to.
but
let's
assume
in
order
to
meet
the
petitioners
head
on
that
it
should
have
decided
the
questions
and
that
by
affirming
the
dismissal,
it
did
decide
this
constitutional
questions.
what
constitutional
right
of
these
petitioners,
have
been
violated?
the
real
attack
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
that's
right,
your
honor.yes.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no
language
except
his
final
conclusion
that
the
demurrer
should
be
sustained,
because
as
i
understand
the
position
of
the
petitioners,
it
is
the
mere
fact
that
their
complaint
was
dismissed
not
because
of
anything
the
judge
myers
or
for
that
matter
judge
(inaudible)
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
said
that
deprived
on
their
constitutional
rights.
but
the
mere
fact
that
their
complaint
was
dismissed,
they
have
engraves.
they
say
all
of
these
questions
which
they
say,
couldn't
have
been
decided
against
them
and
should
have
kept
the
case
in
court
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
think
they
would,
your
honor,
in
this
respect.
if
their
contention
was
going
to
be
as
it
now
is,
that
the
entry
of
a
judgment
on
the
state
a
facts
would
deprive
them
of
constitutional
rights,
then
they
were
obligated
to
assert
in
the
court
that
had
indicated
it
was
going
to
enter
that
judgment
but
to
do
so
would
violate
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
and
i
am
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
as
they
contend
that
they
were.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
yes.
they
must
raise
it
before
the
appellate
court,
certainly.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
we
cited
--
we've
cited
the
california
practice
case
as
to
the
effect
that
the
appellate
courts
need
not,
and
ordinary,
will
not
consider
any
point
not
made
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
there
aren't
--
there
aren't
cases
in
california
to
the
effect
that
a
particular
point
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
in
such
a
way
as
to
require
it
to
pass
upon,
will
not
be
considered
on
appeal
and
it
not
be
considered
on
appeal.
if
the
--
if
the
question
is
there,
if
it
was
before
the
trial
court,
if
in
someway
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
either
by
appropriate
pleading,
by
argument,
by
brief,
by
objection,
by
motion,
by
any
method.
and
the
record
discloses
that
fact
and
the
failure
to
pass
upon
it
below
will
not
preclude
appellate
review
if
it
is
necessary
for
the
appellate
court
to
reach
the
question.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
whatever
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
whatever
their
constitutional
contention
is
today,
it
should
have
been
made
in
that
form
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
although
step
further.
it
should
have
been
made
in
the
trial
court
after
the
trial
court
had
unmistakably
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
enter
that
kind
of
a
judgment
and
a
procedure
was
available
for
making
the
contention
of
the
trial
court.
let
me
give
an
example
that
takes
as
out
of
the
esoteric
realm
of
constitutional
law
but
may
illustrate
california
practice.
generally
speaking,
you
do
not
have
an
order
to
save
a
point
for
appeal.
you
do
not
have
to
renew
it
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
even
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
but
certain
types
of
questions
you
do
because
the
first
opportunity
the
court
has
to
pass
upon
the
question
is
after
the
verdict
had
come
in
or
the
judgment
has
been
entered
as
versus
the
excessiveness
of
damages.
you
cannot
review
that
on
appeal
in
california
unless
you
have
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
upon
that
ground
in
the
lower
court.
now,
what
happened
here?
up
until
the
time
that
the
judgment
of,
first,
the
trial
court
and
then
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
was
entered,
there
was
no
apparent
thought
in
the
minds
of
the
petitioners
but
any
constitutional
rights
had
been
invaded
or
were
going
to
be
invaded.
there
contention
now
is
that
simply
by
dismissing
their
complaint,
their
constitutional
rights
were
invaded,
when
the
court
informed
them
by
sustaining
the
demurrer
without
leave,
that
a
judgment
of
dismissal
would
be
entered
mandatorily
and
as
a
matter
of
routine
within
a
comparatively
short
time.
then
it
was
the
time
we
say,
when
they
should
have
said
to
the
trial
court,
"if
you
enter
this
judgment
which
you
say
you're
going
to
enter,
you
will
deprive
of
us
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
and
all
of
the
rest
of
the
consequences
if
they
now
say,
flow
from
the
mere
fact
of
that
judgment
alone."
remember,
sir,
that
it
is
not
the
judgment
as
a
confirmation
of
some
other
state
action
that
raises
the
constitutional
question
here.
it
is
the
judgment
as
itself
an
act
of
the
state
that
it
is
claimed,
deprived
them
of
their
constitutional
right.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
well,
that
--
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
true
of
almost
any
judgment
or
any
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
in
the
petition
for
rehearing,
certain
limited
constitutional
questions
were
raised.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
--
that
they
did
raise
some
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
if
there
were
time.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
if
they
were
timely
under
the
state
practice
at
that
time.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes.
and
in
substantially
the
same
form,
certainly
no
more
elaborately
in
the
petition
for
hearing
before
the
supreme
court
in
each
instance
along
with
the
primary
stress
on
other
problems,
the
state
law
problems
in
the
case.
in
each
instance,
the
petitions
were
denied
without
opinion,
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
denial
was
based
in
any
way
upon
the
constitutional
question
presented
and
the
assumption
must
be
that
it
was
not
upon
that
ground
because
under
the
california
practice,
questions
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
petition
for
hearing
or
petition
for
rehearing
will
not
be
considered.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
not
as
it
first
develops
at
that
time
and
i
think
by
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
only
the
fact,
that
the
memorandum
opinion
was
a
ruling
that
the
complaint
was
going
to
be
dismissed
for
whatever
reasons.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
on
state
grounds.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
but
it
was
going
to
be
dismissed.
their
contention
now
is
that
that
dismissal
even
on
a
state
ground,
constituted
a
denial
of
the
constitutional
rights
which
they
assert
they
set
up
in
the
complaint.
now,
if
that
dismissal
hands
that
effect,
certainly,
the
latest
time
at
which
they
should
have
challenged
it
was
when
they
were
informed
that
that
was
going
to
be
done.
and
the
memorandum
opinion
informed
them
it
was
going
to
be
done,
not
on
constitutional
grounds,
i
agree,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
not
on
constitutional
ground
does
not
determine
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
are
making.
they
say
regardless
of
the
ground
upon
which
the
trial
court
dismissed
this
complaint.
the
dismissal
in
the
face
of
these
allegations
was
a
denial
of
due
process
of
equal
protection.
and
if
that's
so,
why
then
it
sometime
at
the
earliest
opportunity
after
that
became
apparent,
they
were
required
to
challenge
it.
they
could
have
challenge
at
the
trial
court.
they
didn't
challenge
it
in
the
court
of
appeal
until
a
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
oh,
i
--
i
quite
agree.
it's
a
quite
a
different
question
and
i
have
discussed
and
duplicated
mr.
walker's
discussion
in
response
to
questions
that
i
haven't
intended
myself
to
get
into
it.
but
getting
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
question,
basically,
petitioner's
case
has
rested
on
the
asserted
unlawfulness
of
this
combination
or
agreement
or
conspiracy
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
and
the
question
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
which
must
be
answered
is
whether
such
an
agreement
by
private
individuals
gives
them
a
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
without
reference
to
any
other
legislation
or
implementing
constitutional
provisions
of
any
kind.
the
answer
to
that
question,
is
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
because
at
least
one
thing
has
been
repeated
many
times
in
this
court
without
substantial
dissent
and
that
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
restriction
against
the
states.
it
creates
no
rights
as
between
individual
and
individual.
that
general
proposition
has
been
applied
in
a
context
peculiarly
appropriate
to
this
case
and
in
a
number
of
cases
which
i
am
--
should
render
the
state,
do
no
appear
in
our
brief
but
to
which
i
should
like
to
direct
the
special
attention
of
the
court.
as
we
all
know,
we've
had
for
sometime
federal
legislation
which
makes
it
both
crime
and
a
civil
cause
of
action
at
least
to
the
federal
court
or
two
or
more
persons
to
conspire,
to
intimidate,
threaten
or
oppress
any
citizen
in
a
free
exercise
of
a
right
or
privilege
secured
or
protected
by
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
hodges
versus
united
states,
203
u.s.
1,
it
was
held
that
that
legislation
was
inapplicable
to
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
a
certain
class
of
citizens
of
their
jobs
of
the
right
to
pursue
their
colleagues
because
the
constitutional
power
or
jurisdiction
of
the
congress
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
go
that
far,
to
protecting
individuals
against
individual
exertions
of
arbitrary
or
discriminatory
power.
in
united
states
versus
wheeler,
254
u.s.
281,
an
indictment
for
a
conspiracy
to
deport
citizens
from
one
state
to
another
and
exclude
them
from
the
state
against
private
individual
was
held
that
for
the
same
reason.
in
united
states
against
williams
341
u.s.
70,
involving
the
coerced
confession
by
third
degree
methods
obtained
by
private
individuals.
it
was
held
that
the
rights
which
the
congress
could
constitutionally
protect
as
against
the
action
of
individuals
excluded
those
rights,
which
the
constitution
secured
only
against
state
interference.
now,
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
protect
the
work,
the
right
to
work
or
any
other
right
or
immunity
which
as
against
the
states,
it
protects.
if
it
does
not
protect
it
against
individual
conduct
then
this
combination
or
agreement
cannot
be
unlawful
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
not
unconstitutional
because
it
is
individual
action
and
if
that
is
so,
when
the
district
court
of
appeal
held,
if
it
did
so
hold,
that
petitioners
constitutional
rights
were
not
infringed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
it,
its
action
was
not
unconstitutional.
we
can't
assume,
in
view
of
the
silence
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
with
respect
to
these
constitutional
questions,
a
silence
induced,
we
say,
because
the
questions
were
never
raised.
we
can't
assume
that
the
court
held
anymore
than
what
i
have
just
said.
they
were
asked
to
hold
but
this
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
and
for
injunctive
relief
in
respect
of
a
concerted
combination
not
to
deal.
it
held
expressly
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
because
injury
was
not
shown
or
followed
from
the
alleged
wrongful
act.
it
held,
according
to
petitioners
by
necessary
implication
although
certainly
not
expressly
that
the
combination
was
not
unlawful
for
the
other
reasons
and
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
view
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
which
i've
referred,
and
if
that's
it
held,
it
correctly
decided
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
and
its
decision
cannot
therefore
be
said
in
itself
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
i
should
say,
it
would
depend
on
the
manner
of
the
upholding
and
it
was
just
to
that
that
i
was
coming,
your
honor.
in
the
restrictive
covenant
cases,
in
shelly
against
kraemer,
barrows
against
jackson,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
this
court
did
is
best
typified
by
just
two
or
three
sentences
from
the
opinion
in
barrows,
explaining
what
the
court
had
done
in
shelly.
under
the
applicable
law,
these
covenants
are
not
invalid.
no
one
will
be
punished
for
voluntarily
adhering
to
them.
therefore,
no
one's
constitutional
rights
are
infringed
by
them.
but
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
of
course,
there
was
something
more
in
this
case
than
that.
the
state's
coercive
power
was
put
behind
the
covenant
by
injunctive
restraint
and
mandate
in
shelly,
by
request
for
damages
which
the
california
court
refused
in
barrows,
so
that
the
covenants
there
were
no
longer
voluntarily
covenants
--
voluntarily
adhered
to
but
were
because
of
the
action
taken
by
the
state
court
and
would
on
all
other
cases
have
been
because
of
the
action
taken
by
the
state
court,
covenants,
performance
of
which
could
have
been
compelled
in
a
way
that
action
is
always
and
ordinarily
compelled
through
the
use
of
state
sanctions.
but
the
implications
of
shelly
and
barrows
all
converge
upon
the
proposition,
that
where
all
that
the
state
does
is
to
tolerate
these
covenants
or
agreements,
does
not
put
behind
them
the
coercive
power
of
the
state
to
compel
performance
of
them
that
then
you
have
not
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
only
individual
action
or
state
in
action.
now,
i
say
the
implications
converged
on
that
proposition,
i
gather
that
in
the
first
instance
from
the
care
with
which
the
court
differentiated
the
mere
validity
of
the
covenants
in
themselves
from
the
situation
which
was
produced
when
the
court
enforced
the
covenants
from
the
way
in
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
contrasted
the
terms
state
in
action
and
action.
more
particularly,
however,
i
think
those
implications
come
from
the
whole
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
court,
for
if,
if
mere
state
toleration
of
private
conduct
but
short
of
sanctioning
the
conduct
becomes
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
virtually
all
private
conduct
is
such.
because
all
private
conduct
not
declared
unlawful
by
positive
state
law
is
conduct
which
is
tolerated
by
the
state
but
if
that's
all
the
state
does.
and
if
it
does
not
put
behind
it
the
sanctions
of
its
civil
or
penal
law,
it
is
still
private
conduct.
in
other
words,
as
i
say,
we
do
what
this
court
consistently,
since
this
waterhouse
case
has
refused
to
do,
turned
the
fourteenth
amendment
into
a
municipal
code
for
the
governing
of
individual
action
instead
of
a
restriction
upon
the
states.
and
while
i
realize,
your
honor,
that
it
is
presumptuous
to
attempt
to
tell
a
court
which
decided
the
case,
what
it
meant
by
the
case,
i
think,
i
should
like
to
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
about
marsh
against
alabama.
as
i
read
marsh
against
alabama,
the
state
action
involve
in
that
case,
the
state
action
that
was
expressly
held
it
to
be
unconstitutional
was
not
this
individual
conduct
of
the
managers
of
the
corporation
in
excluding
these
jehovah's
witness
from
the
streets.
it
was
the
act
of
the
state
of
alabama
in
putting
its
criminal
law
behind
that
individual
act
of
the
managers
and
sending
the
jehovah's
witness
to
jail.
and
this
court
expressly
stated,
in
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
that
insofar
as
the
state
has
put
its
power
behind
this
conduct
by
its
penal
statute,
its
action
cannot
stand.
where
is
the
state
action?
there
it
just
does
in
shelly
against
kraemer,
the
private
conduct
was
implemented
by
the
coercive
power
of
the
state,
in
that
case,
the
criminal
sanction
in
shelly
and
barrows
by
the
civil
sanction.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
yes,
sir.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
if
the
denial
--
if
there's
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
but
so
far
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
concerned,
the
constitutional
right
in
the
individual
is
not
to
be
free
from
the
interference
of
other
individuals
but
to
be
free
from
interference
by
the
state.
now,
of
course,
a
judge
--
judgment
--
judicial
action
can
be
state
action
but
it
must
--
i
think
must
be
tested
by
fourteenth
amendment
standards
in
appropriate
cases.
but
when
a
court
--
all
that
a
court
does,
when
all
that
the
court
does
is
to
say,
nothing
in
the
positive
law
of
the
state
of
california
makes
an
agreement
of
this
sort
invalid
so
long
as
it
is
voluntarily
adhered
to,
california
isn't
enforcing
that
agreement.
it
isn't
putting
a
sanction
behind
the
agreement.
it
is
simply,
shrugging
its
shoulders
in
effect
and
saying
private
conduct
will
be
private
conduct
and
it
may
be
distasteful
private
conduct,
it
may
be
calling
private
conduct.
it
may
even
be
conduct
which
if
it
were
undertaken
by
the
state,
would
bring
it
within
the
undertakers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
the
whole
history
of
the
amendment,
as
i
read
that
history,
has
always
been
but
it
is
only
against
the
state
that
it
operates
not
against
the
individual.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
so
long
as
that's
all
there
was.
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
it
would
violate
the
common
law
of
california
in
my
opinion
and
there
would
be
ample
remedy
but
--
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
an
action
for
interference
with
business
relations
or
refusal
not
to
deal.
however,
you
want
to
determine.
mr.
herman
f.
selvin
no,
no.
because
in
order
to
deprive
him
of
a
constitutional
right,
the
depriver
must
be
the
state,
in
this
case,
the
private
individual
who
deprives
him
of
the
right.
our
whole
point
in
that
connection
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
i
say,
is
only
a
restriction
on
the
state.
it
creates
no
rights
between
individuals
as
such.
that
has
been
its
history
and
for
the
reason
to
which
i
have
indicated
and
for,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
perhaps
an
even
more
compelling
reason.
the
basic
purpose,
as
i
see
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
keep
--
secure
the
human
individual
and
his
personal
freedom
and
the
freedom
to
express
himself
in
whatever
ways
within
broad
limits,
his
talent,
his
temperament,
his
personality
may
dictate
it,
to
lay
room
in
this
country
for
all
shapes
and
varieties
of
opinion
and
conduct
without
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
interference
from
the
state.
and
accordingly,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designably
prepared
as
a
restriction
upon
the
state's
power
to
interfere
with
that
individual
freedom
again
within
broad
limits,
not
as
a
restriction
on
the
individual
to
be
as
free
as
consistently
with
the
policy
of
the
state
in
which
he
lives,
he
desires
to
be.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
to
make
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
same
kind
of
a
restriction
on
the
individual
that
it
is
on
to
states
is
not
to
follow
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
to
support
its
great
purpose.
thank
you,
your
honors.
