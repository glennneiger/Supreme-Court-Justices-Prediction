mr.

chief
justice

warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
walker,
should
they
have
raised
--
should
they
have
raised
under
the
california
practice,
the
question
of
constitutionality
in
their
complaint?
are
they
obliged
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
authorities
to
that
effect
in
the
united
states
court,
i
say,
are
in
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
ask,
just
this
one
question.
if
the
plaintiffs
were
not
required
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
trial
court
in
their
complaint,
where
would
be
the
first
time
that
they
would
be
obliged
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
doesn't
the
court
think
its
true
everything
that's
in
the
--
in
the
complaint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
cite
in
your
--
in
your
brief
the
--
the
california
case
of
the
said
complaint
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
raised
it
before
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
selvin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
i
want
--
i'd
like
to
clear
up
something
in
my
mind.
as
i
understood
mr.
walker,
there
are
no
california
cases
which
would
require
the
constitutional
issued
to
the
pleading
that
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
would
you
mind
telling
me
then
what
there
is
in
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
superior
court
judge
that
would
require
them
to
raise
all
of
these
issues
before
the
court
of
appeals?
what
language
in
that
opinion
would
--
would
require
the
raising
of
it
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
the
superior
judge
put
it
on
--
on
state
grounds
other
than
--
than
federal
constitutional
grounds
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
would
they
be
--
be
obliged
to
do
more
than
to
--
to
meet
the
--
the
issue,
as
raised
by
the
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
--
did
you
cite
the
opinions
of
that
effect
on
you
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
--
if
a
plaintiff
files
an
ordinary
tort
action
in
the
superior
court
and
the
court
sustains
a
general
demurrer
on
state
grounds,
is
the
plaintiff
to
be
prejudiced
because
he
doesn't
raise
a
constitutional
question
when
he
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
to
reverse
the
superior
court.
are
there
cases
to
that
effect
in
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
supposed
the
constitution
--
constitutional
issue
first
develops
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
would
it
be
too
late
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
raise
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
rehearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
asked,
mr.
selvin,
what
--
what
is
there
if
he
doesn't
have
to
allege
in
the
complaint?
what
is
there
in
the
memorandum
of
opinion
of
the
superior
judge
that
would
compel
him
to
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
if
he's
to
raise
it
in
the
time
and
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
state
--
on
state
grounds?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
supposed
the
state
court
upheld
restricted
covenants
if
in
being,
would
that
be
state
action?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
that
be
denial
of
a
--
of
a
constitutional
right
by
state
which
would
continue
a
illegal
practice
of
this
state
action
as
well
as
if
the
judgment
had
gone
for
the
--
for
the
plaintiff
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
affirmative
relief
against
the
defendants?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you
say
all
the
employers
in
california
join
together
and
inspired
together
to
prevent
this
certain
group
of
citizens
from
--
of
california
from
--
from
being
employed
any
place
in
california,
that
would
not
violate
some
constitutional
provision?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
the
remedy
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
a
man
whom
he
has
one
skill
that
he
alleges
that
he
has
been
kept
out.
the
only
industry
in
which
he
can
use
that
skill
is
that
just
--
is
that
not
just
as
much
to
try
with
him
of
his
constitutional
right
as
if
he
was
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
margolis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead
you
--
you
have
30
seconds.
