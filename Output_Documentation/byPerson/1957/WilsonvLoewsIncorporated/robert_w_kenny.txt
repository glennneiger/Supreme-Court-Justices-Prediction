mr.
robert
w.
kenny
if
the
court
please.
the
petitioners
had
planned
to
divide
their
argument
and
my
purpose
would
keep
the
--
me
to
discuss
the
facts
in
the
record,
the
procedural
steps
that
brought
us
to
this
court
and
then
my
colleague,
mr.
margolis
will
discuss
the
constitutional
and
legal
questions
that
are
applicable
to
them.this
case
involves
the
black
list
in
the
entertainment
industry.
this
black
list
is
now
over
10
years
old
and
it's
still
in
existence
today.
and
because
of
it,
men
and
women
are
still
excluded
from
callings
to
which
they
haven't
devoted
their
entire
professional
lives
and
careers.
the
existence
of
this
black
list
is
admitted
by
the
pleadings.no
judicial
relief,
however,
either
by
injunctions
or
by
damages
has
ever
yet
been
given
to
the
victims
of
what
is
conceded
on
the
pleadings
to
be
the
concerted
action
of
a
monopolistic
group
that
controls
all
of
the
employment
opportunities
in
this
particular
industry.
we
have
never
even
had
a
trial.
and
on
the
pleadings,
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
case
of
a
complete
monopoly
of
both
the
production
and
the
distribution
of
motion
pictures
and
of
all
employment
opportunities
in
that
industry
in
the
united
states.
american
history,
i
believe,
has
very
few
parallels
to
such
a
situation
as
continues
to
exist
in
the
motion
picture
industry
today.
the
facts
alleged
in
the
petitioner's
complaint
are
as
follows.
there
are
23
petitioners
in
this
case.
they
are
actors
and
actresses
and
writers
and
research
workers
and
backlot
workers,
one
classified
as
a
grip.
at
the
time
they
filed
their
complaint
in
the
state
court
of
california
in
march
1953,
these
petitioners
had
each,
from
five
to
25
years,
of
experience
in
their
professions.
and
many
of
them
had
acquired
reputations,
national
reputations
for
excellence
of
work
in
the
motion-picture
industry
and
at
one
high
esteem
professionally.
the
respondents,
that
is
the
industry
respondents,
are
the
motion-picture
distributors
and
producers
of
the
united
states.
between
them,
they
control
all
of
the
production
and
distribution
of
motion
pictures
and
they
control,
as
i've
said,
all
employment
industries
for
all
employees
in
the
motion-picture
industry.
two
of
the
remaining
respondents
are
members
of
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
and
the
third
is
an
investigator
employed
by
that
committee.
the
complaint
alleges
that
these
respondents
acted
both
officially
and
unofficially.
the
agreement
of
the
respondents
is
that
prior
to
march
of
1951,
and
we
alleged
the
agreement
was
made,
they
agreed
first
to
exclude
from
employment
in
the
motion-picture
industry
all
persons
who
sought
employment
who
had
been
subpoenaed
as
witnesses
before
the
house
committee
and
who
relied
on
their
federal
constitutional
privileges
including
the
fifth
amendment
to
answer
questions
that
pertain
to
their
political
affiliations
and
associations
or
beliefs.
18
of
the
petitioners
fall
under
this
category.
second
part
of
the
agreement
was
among
the
respondents
that
they
would
exclude
from
employment
in
the
industry
all
persons
who
had
been
named
as
communists
but
who
had
failed
to
appear
voluntarily
before
the
committee
and
upon
such
voluntary
appearance
submit
to
committee
inquiries
without
asserting
their
constitutional
privileges.
and
five
of
the
petitioners
fall
within
this
group.
furthermore,
this
agreement
among
the
respondents
was
that
they
would
persuade
all
other
employers
in
the
industry
to
desist
and
refrain
from
employing
all
such
persons
with
the
intent
of
preventing
them
from
obtaining
any
employment
in
the
motion-picture
industry.
then
as
one
of
the
means
of
effectuating
this
agreement,
all
of
the
respondents
published
and
circulated
throughout
the
entire
industry
a
list
which
contained
the
names
of
all
such
employment,
the
employees
who
came
within
these
two
categories
with
the
direction
and
intent
that
they'd
not
be
employed
and
the
publication
and
circulation
of
such
a
list
continues
today.
while
alleges
that
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
was
first,
to
limit
control
and
direct
the
political
activities
of
all
employees
of
the
respondents.
and
second,
to
coerce
and
influence
in
the
motion-picture
industry
all
employees
by
threat
of
loss
of
employment
and
thereby
to
coerce
them
to
refrain
for
--
from
adopting
or
following
any
political
action
or
relying
which
was
not
acceptable
to
the
house
un-american
activities
committee.
and
third
--
the
third
purpose
was
to
limit
employment
to
those
persons
whose
political
believes
were
acceptable
to
that
committee.
and
fourth,
to
limit
the
production
of
motion
pictures
by
the
industry
to
those
the
conduct
--
the
content
of
which
was
acceptable
to
the
house
un-american
activities
committee.
when
it
states
that
the
defendants
and
each
of
them
by
this
conduct
wrongfully,
maliciously
and
without
justification
have
interfered
with
and
injured
the
right
of
said
employees
and
other
persons
reasonably
to
expect
employment
in
the
motion-picture
industry
and
to
pursue
their
professions
and
occupations
therein
and
it
prevented
their
employment
there.
the
--
as
i
said,
the
complaint
was
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
money
damages.
thus,
in
the
original
complaint,
the
petitioners
sought
enforcement
of
three
federal
rights
by
the
california
state
courts.
these
were,
first,
the
right
to
pursue
their
chosen
callings
in
the
industry,
second,
their
right
to
attend
as
witnesses
in
a
federal
forum
and
to
invoke
there
their
federal
constitutional
privileges,
and
third,
their
rights
to
freedom
of
speech
and
press
an
assembly
to
be
exercised
free
from
coercion
and
interference.
now,
the
pleadings
in
the
state
court
conform
to
the
california
rule
that
ultimate
facts
only
can
be
pleaded
and
that
references
to
statutes
and
constitutional
provisions
and
principles
of
law
are
not
properly
part
of
the
pleadings
themselves.
the
respondents
demurred
generally
to
the
original
complaint.
and
in
california
as
elsewhere,
a
demurrer
admits
the
truth
of
all
facts
that
are
properly
pleaded.
the
trial
judge
in
the
law
and
motion
department
of
the
superior
court
there
in
los
angeles
sustained
these
general
demurrers
up
to
the
original
complaint
and
a
minute
order
which
gave
no
indication
of
the
grounds
and
had
no
opinion
but
gave
his
leave
to
amend.
and
since
the
demurrer
was
impart
based
upon
the
ground
that
the
words
"black
list"
and
"conspiracy"
were
conclusions
of
law,
we
amended
omitting
the
use
of
those
words
but
otherwise,
the
amended
complaint
was
identical
with
the
original
complaint.
and
there,
the
respondents
again
demurred
generally
to
the
amended
complaint.
this
time,
the
trial
court
sustained
the
demurrers
without
leave
to
amend.
however,
this
time,
the
trial
court
rendered
a
written
opinion,
which
is
part
of
the
record.
i
point
out
that
despite
the
arguments
that
the
respondents
had
made
to
the
trial
court
despite
those
and
contrary
to
them,
the
trial
court
held
that
we,
the
petitioners,
did
have
a
standing
to
sue
in
the
court
for
an
invasion
of
our
right
to
work.
and
the
trial
court,
in
its
opinion,
recognized
that
we
were
asserting
a
right
to
pursue
as
petitioners,
the
--
their
chosen
professions
to
attend
as
witnesses
in
a
federal
form
and
to
evoke
their
federal
constitutional
privileges
without
losing
their
right
to
work
and
their
rights
to
freedom
of
speech.
however,
the
trial
court
did
sustain
the
demurrers
upon
the
ground
that
the
burden
was
upon
the
petitioners
to
plead
a
lack
of
justification.
and
they
were
required
to
--
the
court
rule,
that
we
were
to
plead
a
lack
of
justification
for
the
acts
of
the
respondents.
and
the
trial
court
held
that
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
with
respect
to
the
invocation
of
constitutional
privileges
and
its
purpose
of
limiting
the
political
beliefs
of
the
employees
and
of
restricting
the
content
of
motion-picture,
trial
court
had
held
that
all
of
that
did
not
show,
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
lack
of
justification.
and
in
the
trial
court's
written
opinion,
it
was
discussed,
it
was
discussed
first
the
relationship
of
the
right
to
work,
to
due
process
and
to
the
privileges
of
--
and
immunities
of
citizens.
and
we
say
that
this
is
the
constitutional
case
which
permeates
the
entire
--
it
is
the
constitutional
point
that
permanetes
the
entire
case.
second,
the
trial
court,
in
its
opinion,
discussed
the
--
state
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
duty
of
the
state
to
protect
against
private
action
directed
out
of
its
exercise.
we
say
that
these
are
the
questions
obviously
arising
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
third,
the
trial
court
held
that
since
the
state
government
could
fire
employees
who
were
claiming
the
fifth
amendment,
this,
i
might
say,
was
written
before
this
court's
decision
in
slochower,
the
court
said,
"well,
since
the
state
can
fire
employees
and
take
the
fifth
amendment,
a
reason
from
that
that
private
employers
have
the
same
rights."
and
fourth,
the
trial
court
opinion
contained
a
likely
discussion
of
--
of
free
speech,
political
sense,
association,
the
censorship,
allegations
of
the
complaint.
but
it
held
that
a
private
combination
of
private
employers
which
act
--
acted
to
suppress
these
rights
was
not
unlawful.so
the
trial
court
sustained,
as
i
say,
the
general
demurrers
without
leave
to
amend
and
this
made
an
entry
of
the
judgment
of
dismissal
mandatory
and
a
judgment
of
dismissal
so
entered
is
final
and
appealable.
and
we
appeal,
we
appeal
to
the
district
court
of
appeals,
which
is
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
in
california.
and
in
that
appeal,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
of
dismissal,
which
held
the
petitioners
to
be
without
any
remedy
at
all,
that
that
judgment
had
deprived
the
petitioners
of
their
liberties
and
properties
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
urge
that
the
monopolistic
combination
of
the
respondents
had
deprived
the
petitioners
of
their
fundamental
right
to
work
for
a
living.
we
urge
that
the
combination
of
respondents
had
arrogated
powers
that
were
denied
the
government
itself.
fourth,
that
the
conduct
of
the
witnesses
before
the
committee
and
their
exercise
of
constitutional
privileges,
including
the
one
against
self-incrimination,
did
not
justify
this
concerted
agreement.
and
we
finally
urged
that
the
respondents
had
invaded
rights
secured
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
was
patently
violative
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
press
and
assembly.
the
district
court
had
appealed
and
handed
down
its
opinion
which
completely
disregarded
the
reasoning
of
the
trial
court.
and
the
trial
court's
reasoning
was
that
the
justification
was
not
a
matter
--
it
was
not
a
matter
of
defense.
it
was
a
matter
that
we
had
to
overcome
affirmatively
by
our
own
pleading.
the
district
court
of
appeals
disregarded
that
and
instead,
the
district
court
of
appeal,
for
the
first
time
since
the
inception
of
these
proceedings,
held
that
the
complaint
was
insufficient
because
it
had
failed
to
allege
any
existing
contract
or
any
prospect
of
a
contract.
and
the
appellate
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
view
of
that
conclusion,
it
didn't
reach
any
of
the
other
part
--
points
that
have
been
urged
by
counsel.
so
i
say
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
state
courts
have
ruled
in
favor
of
the
respondents'
argument
that
the
petitioners
could
not
prevail
unless
they
were
able
to
plead
a
right
based
on
a
specific
contract
or
the
prospect
of
one.
the
petitioners
then
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
which
we
again
argued
that
the
appellate
court
had
denied
us
the
equal
protection
of
law
and
deprived
us
of
property
without
due
process
when
it
had
held
that
we
had
no
legal
regrets
against
admitted
wrongdoers
who
would
deprive
them
admittedly
of
their
right
to
pursue
their
chosen
avocations
merely
because
the
petitioners
were
not
able
to
allege
the
existence
of
a
contract
or
the
probability
of
a
contract
for
employment.
that
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied.
thereafter,
we,
petitioners,
petitioned
the
--
the
state
supreme
court
for
a
hearing.
and
we
again
raise
all
of
the
previously
discussed
constitutional
issues.
the
supreme
court
denied
this
petition.
however,
mr.
justice
carter
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
petition
should
have
been
granted.
so
i
say
the
petitioners'
case
is
grounded
primarily
on
their
contention
that
the
conduct
and
agreement
of
the
respondents
wrongfully
and
unjustifiably
impaired
their
reasonable
expectation
of
employment
in
the
industry
and
their
federally
protected
right
to
pursue
their
professions
and
occupations.
the
respondents'
contention,
with
which
the
state
court
agreed,
is
that
the
petitioners
had
no
standing
to
sue
at
all
because
they
could
not
allege
that
they
had
an
employment
contract
or
a
specific
prospect
of
one.
we
contend
that
it
was
the
exclusion
from
all
work
opportunity
by
this
monopolistic
combination
and
not
the
deprivation
of
some
specific
contract
that
was
the
wrong
committed
here.
mr.
robert
w.
kenny
no,
this
was
a
--
a
suit
--
a
common
law
action
for
concerted
refusal
to
deal.
