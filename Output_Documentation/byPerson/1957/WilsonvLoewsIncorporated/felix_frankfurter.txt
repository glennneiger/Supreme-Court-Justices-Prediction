justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
gather
from
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
to
mr.
kenny
that
this
is
for
a
tort
action
(inaudible)
common
law,
by
common
law,
i
mean
an
action
of
tort
under
allowable
california
law,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no
--
this
fact,
no
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
if
california
tomorrow
saw
fit
to
abolish
all
--
withdrew
from
the
jurisdiction
of
its
court
all
tort
action,
you
--
your
redress
wouldn't
be
in
the
california
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
might
have
to
go
to
the
federal
courts
but
couldn't
california
say,
“we
don't
believe
in
state-imposed
duty
and
damages"?
i
don't
know
whether
california
has
but
also
took
tort
actions
from
time
to
time
withdrawn
from
the
statute
saying
the
court
shan't
bring
suit
for
breach
of
promise.
the
court
--
court
shan't
jurisdiction
for
this
statute
is
out
on
other
thing.
and
if
california
chose
not
to
allow
recovery
to
this
court
with
torts
with
anything
of
the
due
process
clause
that
--
that
require
this
court
to
say,
“you
must
do
your
course
for
that
purpose.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
california
stated,
“we
don't
believe
in
litigation,
we'll
have
no
courts,”
could
this
court
issue
a
mandamus
that
should
have
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
therefore
you
could
go
to
the
federal
court
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
could
therefore
impose
jurisdiction
upon
state
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
might
very
well.
you
might
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
state
your
answer
quite
clearly
was
that
you're
here
seeking
to
enforce
a
course
of
action
given
you
by
the
common
law
of
california,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
arrive
from
common
law
of
california
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suing
--
are
you
suing
for
money
or
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
money
are
you
suing
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
state
has
all
sorts
of
power
to
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
its
court
and
to
make
certain
requirement
of
what
enables
you
to
get
relief
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
make
money
limitations.
it
may
make
class
limitation
as
a
course
of
action.
like
this
court,
it
may
have
requirement
about
standing,
etcetera,
etcetera,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
caused
--
you
haven't
got
a
contract
of
expectation
of
getting
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
call
--
that's
what
i
call
standing
to
sue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
does
that
imply
that
in
very
cognate
cases,
they
don't
make
this
requirement
to
a
suit
that
you
have
either
an
existing
or
a
prospectively
promising
opportunity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
cognate
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
they
--
in
other
cases,
they
don't
make
this
requirement.
before
you
can
get
relief,
you
must
either
allege
a
breach
of
contract
or
a
breach
of
a
perspective
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
not
an
abstract
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they're
in
the
business
of
dealing
with
real
life
litigations
and
real
life
intrusions
into
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
court,
the
court
of
california
said
you
haven't
got
it,
if
you
haven't
got
a
contract
or
the
likelihood
of
getting
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understood
judge
kenny
didn't
say
that
that
was
the
only
ground
of
the
court,
it
said
either
an
existing
contract
or
the
expectation
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
may
belong
to
a
people
who
are
handicapped
either
by
talent
or
by
age
or
by
something
else
that's
relevant
to
the
--
to
the
prospective
contractor.
he
may
have
lack
of
those
qualifications
which
are
likely
to
get
him
a
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
compel
the
movie
people
from
hiring
any
of
these
people
even
if
every
one
of
these
conditions
are
satisfied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
i'm
asking
whether
you
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
say
that
that's
what
we
call
an
unreasonable
classification
and
therefore
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
constitutional
questions,
these
other
constitution?
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
totally
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
the
state
can't
draw
a
line
of
relief
between
those
who
enjoy
existing
conflicts,
i
have
a
prospect
of
one,
and
those
who
are
without
qualifications.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
makes
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
equal
protection
or
--
or
violation
of
denial
--
it
may
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
even
as
to
interest
or
opportunities
which
the
state
has
the
right
to
deny
everybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
can't
make
a
differentiation
that
has
no
basis
in
what
we
call
(inaudible)
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
--
on
this
propriety,
you
should
invoke
truax
against
corrigan.
i
noticed
that
this
is,
for
me,
a
very
offensive
case
or
invoke
by
a
so-called
liberal
lawyers
whenever
they
seek
their
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
for
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
from
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
are
right,
you
have
at
least
stated
a
federal
cause
of
action
against
federal
officials.
but
this
--
this
is
a
california
tort
action.
i
don't
see
how
you
--
how
you
can
say
this
is
a
violation
by
federal
officials
of
their
federal
obligations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
has
nothing
--
that's
true
about
the
opinions.
i
mean
--
what
you've
just
said
is
true
as
against
this
(inaudible)
defendant
who
hold
no
federal
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
complaint
charge
that
these
members
of
the
--
of
the
congress
were
in
--
if
i
may
use
a
vulgaris,
were
in
cahoots
with
the
hollywood
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
this
is
a
conscious
that
they
got
together,
not
that
they
accomplished
convergingly
the
same
result
but
they
really
had
a
community
of
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
--
but
somehow
rather
there
was
a
partnership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
they
brought
the
favors,
the
charges
that
some
members
of
this
committee
sat
down
or
communicated
or
telephoned
or
wired
or
talked,
is
that
right?
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
this.
i
don't
see
what
the
point
is
of
striking
conspiracy
but
insisting
there
was
an
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
draw
a
fair
inference
in
your
argument
that
f.e.p.c.
legislation
is
really
redundant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
point
of
view
of
--
of
constitutionality,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
a
large
corporation,
as
many
of
you
do,
excludes
certain
categories
from
employment,
from
the
point
of
view
of
--
of
a
deprivation
on
what
you're
talking
about,
i
repeat
my
question.
isn't
f.e.p.c.
largely
needless
legislation
because
it's
now
in
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
violation
of
the
sherman
law
is
--
such
as
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
a
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
large
employer
as
always
--
any
number
of
this
country,
large,
single
corporate
large
employers.
i
gather
your
argument
and
draw
the
proper
inference.
you
can
accomplish
under
the
constitution
now
with
all
these
painful
under
all
small
productive
efforts
as
getting
f.e.p.c.
legislation
where
the
case
is
concerned
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
one
doesn't
go
on
the
ground
in
marsh
that
it
was
--
that
a
private
person
couldn't
do
that.
that
isn't
the
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
nothing
to
do
what
i
think
about
this.
we're
talking
here
about
the
powers
of
courts,
ambiguous
powers
of
this
court
deal
with
what
california
did
as
a
matter
of
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
i
think
is
distasteful
to
me
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
awful
lot
of
things
that
is
distasteful
to
me
that
i
can't
do
anything
about
it
as
a
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
answer
your
question
because
i
don't
accept
your
starting
point
that
a
private
organization
determining
who
should
be
admitted
to
justice
is
the
same
thing
as
hollywood.
we
haven't
yet
reached
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
further
question?
in
the
petition
for
review
or
whatever
segment
you
will
call?
what
is
it
in
california?
when
you
decide
the
supreme
court
to
review
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
is
that,
i
take
it,
the
petitioners
bring
federal
--
i
take
it,
i
assume,
they
raise
federal
constitutional
question,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
they
did
it
--
when
they
raised
it
in
their
petition
for
review
to
the
supreme
court
of
california,
in
your
opposition
to
that
petition.
i
assumed
you
made
it
on
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
raise
the
question
that
you
raise
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
federal
question
was
too
late.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
if
i
recollect
that.
this
case
is
to
hasten
the
--
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied
without
ado,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
walker
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
walker,
did
i
--
did
i
understand,
the
rule
which
were
invoked
and
which,
i
think
strongly
to
be
expected
here.
the
reason
for
that
rule
is
that,
did
you
make
a
federal
claim?
you
are
to
give
the
state
court
an
opportunity
to
pass
it
on
rather
this
court
can't
say
that
the
state
court
disregarded
the
federal
claim
if
it
wasn't
brought
to
its
attention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
reason
is
satisfied
if
the
state
court
of
its
own
appeals
that
the
determination
of
what
is
brought
before
does
involve
such
a
federal
question.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
opinion
of
the
amendment
--
memorandum
ruling
of
the
superior
court
on
page
46.in
the
present
case,
the
question
has
have
plaintiff
properly
raised
in
their
pleading,
the
question
of
defendants
liability
for
a
concerted
refusal
without
justifications?
the
answer
requires
the
consideration
of
the
privilege
to
refuse
self-incrimination.
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
--
to
the
constitution
that
is
before
the
citation,
i
think,
and
the
privilege
of
embodying
the
california
constitutional
law.
now,
if
the
court
of
its
own
motion
concluded
that
in
order
to
pass
on
the
issue
that
is
before
it
requires
a
scrutiny
of
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution
doesn't
that
bring
the
federal
constitutional
question
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say
--
do
i
infer
that
you
mean
--
you
suggest
that
in
all
event,
these
questions
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
before
the
duty
of
the
state
court
to
accord
a
remedy
for
some
affirmative
--
some
inroad
upon
a
federal
right
to
those
questions,
not
only
were
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
california
court
but
they
were
not
brought
and
the
court
did
not
deal
what
they
were
in
because
they
didn't
discussed
it.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
sherman
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
local
sherman
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
on
the
assumption
that
the
--
these
constitutional
rights
were
raised
by
their
complaint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
--
if
a
complaint
raises
federal
constitutional
rights
and
the
court
throws
out
the
complaint
or
decides
adversely
to
the
complaint.
it
is
to
be
deemed
on
state
ground.
are
you
saying
that
it
is
the
law
of
california
which
is
(inaudible),
are
you
saying
that
if
they
want
to
save
their
federal
constitutional
right
--
rights,
which
were
not
pass
on
by
the
(inaudible)
judge
what
should
have
been
passed
on,
they
must
raise
that
before
the
appellate
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
think
two
questions
little
blended
in
your
argument.
part
of
your
argument
is
--
is
at
the
point
that
mr.
walker
gets
it,
namely,
that
in
the
superior
court
--
superior
court
exposed
of
this
complaint
on
a
professed
state
ground.
it
entered
an
appeal
to
the
district
court
and
under
your
law,
under
california
procedure
if
they
claim
that
the
judgment
in
the
superior
court
denied
their
federal
claim
here,
properly
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
superior
court
in
the
complaint.
that
although
the
--
the
superior
court
confess
to
go
on
a
state
ground.
they
still
insist
that
there's
a
federal
claim
which
they
have
a
right
to
have
enforce
by
appropriate
appeal
in
the
district
court.
that's
the
question
of
the
procedural
mode
by
which
a
federal
question
must
be
brought
before
a
state
court.
that's
a
very
different
question
as
i
gather.
there's
nothing
to
do
as
to
whether
or
not
what
the
court
of
california
here
did
was
before
we
say
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
by
the
supremacy
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
refers
to
something
which
is
the
supreme
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
i
should
think
and
(inaudible)
to
the
pleadings
here
and
say
that
in
your
complaint,
you
raised
the
constitutional
questions
you
urged
against
the
bar.
can
one
say
that
you
raise
these
questions
after
the
district
court
decided
against
them?
can
one
say
that
you
raised
them
that
the
--
if
the
district
court
considered
them
in
any
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
in
your
--
in
your
opinion
to
the
district
court,
that
we
raised
the
following
federal
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
mean
anything
to
me
mr.
margolis,
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
supremacy
clause
substitute
some
other
provision
of
federal
rights
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
asking
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
supremacy
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
be
vital
whether
or
not
according
to
california
procedural
law,
you
raised
the
federal
question
in
time
for
consideration
by
the
district
court
or
by
the
superior
court
which
it
raised
and
not
passed
on
by
the
superior
court.
at
that
time,
i
think,
i
understand
california
law
to
be,
it
would
be
very
common
that
if
you
raise
a
federal
constitutional
question
in
the
court
of
first
instance
and
that
court,
for
one
reason
or
another
doesn't
deal
with
the
federal
question,
you
may
then
go
up
to
the
appellate
court
and
say
we
have
a
federal
claim
which
we
exist
on
and
which
the
court
adversely,
have
not
passed
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
federal
court
didn't
pass
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
superior
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
didn't
pass
on
it,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
tell
me
this.
under
california
law,
in
order
to
go
out
to
the
district
court
must
--
what
kind
of
a
paper
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
brief
you
must
set
forth
the
questions
that
you
want
the
district
court
could
pass
on,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
to
bring
questions
of
constitutionality
that
you
want
passed
on
to
the
objection
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
if
it
was
done,
it
was
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
you
mean
that
--
that
the
first
time
you
knew
and
could
deal
with
the
provisions
of
the
superior
court
that
in
order
to
bring
an
ordinary
common
law
at
all
for
infraction
of
the
right,
require
that
you
allege
that
you
have
some
interest
into
the
point
of
asking
for
a
job,
the
deprivation
of
which
was
the
basis
of
your
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
basis
of
the
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
explicitly
--
explicit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
look
what
it
says
in
the
superior
court.
the
plaintiff
has
not
alleged
the
existence
of
any
contract,
that
any
defendant
or
(inaudible)
or
attempted
any
conventional
allegation
of
the
restraint
of
trade.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
couldn't
have
been
surprised
by
a
question
which
the
superior
court
discussed
and
even
assuming
that
is
so,
there
are
other
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
say,
they
were
surprised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
state
action
against
you
and
not
granting
you
relief.
that
was
the
state
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
action
isn't
the
point
of
law.
a
state
action
is
granting
or
denial
a
remedy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
were
appealing
and
we
are
considering
here
judgment
not
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
you
rely
on,
that
important
case,
very
important
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
when
a
court
decides
something
that
is
really
a
surprise,
it
couldn't
be
a
surprise
if
the
court
had
it
in
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
--
there
was
no
question.
that
issue
was
not
incompetent
and
my
suggestion
is
that
here,
this
issue
was
in
controversy
but
lower
court
says
--
the
superior
court
says,
assuming
you're
right,
let's
go
on.
and
to
say
that
that
has
deprived
(inaudible)
case
every
time
that
a
district
(inaudible)
the
court,
discusses
an
issue
and
proposed
of
it
is
a
surprise
if
on
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
takes
to
congress.
