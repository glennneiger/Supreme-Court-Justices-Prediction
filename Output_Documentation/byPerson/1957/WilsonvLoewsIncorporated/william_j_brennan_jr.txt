justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this,
mr.
selvin.
are
you
suggesting
that
what
should
have
been
done
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
effect
was
to
say,
the
judgment
dismissing
the
complaints
by
sustaining
the
demur.
denies
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
it
denies
a
remedy
where
california
should
provide
a
remedy
--

et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
it
be
an
act
of
the
state
until
the
opportunities
to
appeal
from
it
had
been
exhausted
and
the
appeals
determined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
gather
that
it
was
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
you
conceive
these
questions
were
properly
raised?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
bring
those
questions
here.
to
bring
--
sufficiently
in
any
event
to
bring
those
questions
here,
i
gather
you
conceive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
were
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
that
petition
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
--
what
was
raised
throughout?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
federal
rights.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
right
there.
what
is
the
specific
state
action
on
which
you
complain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
addressed
the
federal
questions
at
least
to
that
action
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
in
the
superior
court,
you
have
a
cause
of
action
without
having
a
contract
to
the
possibility,
that
for
the
first
time
or
probability
one
but
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
law
was
laid
down
that
you
have
no
cause
of
action
without
--
after
showing
a
contract
or
the
probability
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where's
your
petition
for
rehearing,
this
printed
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
file
with
the
clerk?
