mr.
irving
m.
walker
i'm
sorry
but
i
understand
your
statement
--
provided
argument.
i
must
confess
to
a
sentimental
desire
on
my
part
not
to
complete
a
professional
career
that
run
for
50
odd
years
without
having
the
privilege
of
addressing
this
court.
i
have
a
more
substantive
reason,
however,
for
presenting
an
argument
at
this
time.
i
should
like
to
emphasize
one
of
the
points
that
are
made
by
the
respondents,
which
it
seems
to
me
might
be
controlling
of
this
case
in
this
court.
i
refer
particularly,
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
more
particularly
to
the
contention
of
the
respondents
that
the
constitutional
points
now
are
being
urged
upon
the
court
by
the
petitioners
were
raised
too
late.
they
were
not
raised
in
the
trial
court.
it's
quite
too
that
under
the
law
of
california
a
statement
or
allegations
of
fact
are
all
that
is
required.
but
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
attention
of
the
court
if
constitutional
points
are
involved
or
federal
laws
are
involved
must
be
called
to
that
fact.
and
in
the
case
at
bar
and
notwithstanding
the
protestations
of
my
learned
opponent,
these
matters
were
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court.
there
is
a
statement
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
effect
that
they
were
all
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
i
must
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
nowhere
in
this
record
does
it
appear
that
these
matters
were
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
as
constitutional
questions
and
that
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
did
not
vest
upon
any
of
the
so-called
constitutional
questions.
it
is
true
that
in
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
trial
judge,
there
is
some
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination.
but
it's
in
the
general
context
of
the
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
in
the
action
had
met
--
met
the
obligation
to
show
that
there
was
no
justification
for
the
complaint
of
acts
of
the
defendants.
now,
it
is
said
by
the
petitioners
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
has
denied
them
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
an
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes,
indeed
--
mr.
irving
m.
walker
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
they
raised
a
number
of
these
questions
all
those
--
mr.
irving
m.
walker
that
is
too
late
under
our
facts
and
has
been
so
declared
by
this
court
in
connection
with
california
cases.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
glad
so.
that's
the
reason
i
indicated
that
this
might
be
determined
into
the
case.
there
is
the
complaint
as
indicated
by
mr.
margolis
that
it
is
the
judgment
--
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
it's
a
petition
--
it's
a
petition
to
review,
a
petition
to
hear
after
decision
by
the
district
court.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
they
raised
them
first,
as
i
see
it,
in
the
petition
for
a
rehearing
before
the
district
court
and
again
raised
them
in
their
petition
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes,
your
honor
and
also
in
our
reply
to
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
district
court
of
appeals.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes,
a
mere
order
of
denial.
no
--
no
opinion
of
memorandum
or
otherwise.
the
petitioner's
complaint,
that
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
that
raises
these
questions
of
due
process
and
so
forth.
now,
if
that
is
true,
it
was
equally
true
of
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
when
the
demurrer
was
sustained
without
leave
to
amend
as
i
think
counsel
has
conceded.
it
was
inevitable
that
a
judgment
of
dismissal
would
be
entered
unless
something
was
done
by
the
plaintiffs
to
stay
off
that
result.
then
they
knew
that
this
judgment
which
they
claim
would
have
or
does
have
this
effect
was
going
to
be
entered
and
they
have
the
opportunity
under
the
california
law
and
beyond
any
possible
question
at
anytime
before
the
judgment
was
entered,
to
ask
the
trial
court
for
a
reconsideration
of
this
matter
and
they
could
then
have
indicated
to
the
trial
court
that
these
constitutional
questions
were
involved
and
that
a
judgment
such
as
was
indicated
would
create
this
cons
--
constitutional
situation.
no
such
motion
for
reconsideration
was
made
and
the
judgment
was
entered.
and
in
that
connection,
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
seems
to
me
to
be
an
inconsistency
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners.
they
say
that
these
problems,
these
constitutional
problems
were
involved
in
this
case
from
the
out
--
outset
by
reason
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
how
can
that
be
true
if
their
reliance
here
is
upon
a
claim
that
the
judgment
is
the
thing
that
creates
the
constitutional
questions
because
there
they
say,
came
the
action
on
the
part
of
the
state
which
was
required
in
order
to
make
them
fourteenth
amendment
questions.
now,
there
was
no
element
of
surprise
as
far
as
these
gentlemen
were
concerned
in
the
decision
of
the
district
court
of
appeals.
it
is
true
that
the
trial
court
did
not
base
its
determination
upon
one
of
the
grounds
that
was
urged
by
the
defendants,
the
respondents
here.
but
the
record
shows,
and
i
refer
to
page
27
of
the
transcript
in
this
court,
to
an
excerpt
on
the
memorandum
of
points
and
authorities
in
support
of
the
demur
of
the
respondents.
the
complaint
does
not
state
facts
sufficient
to
--
to
constitute
a
cause
of
action
for
interference
with
business
relations.
no
existing
contract
between
plaintiffs
and
any
of
the
defendants
is
alleged.
consequently,
there
must
be
shown
a
reasonable
probability
that
but
for
the
alleged
interference.
business
relations
between
the
parties
would
have
been
entered
into.
it
is
not
enough
that
plaintiff's
hope
or
even
expected
that
such
relations
might
eventuate,
the
fact
that
they
would
have
eventuated
must
appear
citing
authority
for
the
contention.
and
so,
they
knew
as
soon
as
the
first
demurrer
was
filed
that
this
was
one
of
the
contentions
of
the
respondents
as
to
the
law
of
this
case
and
might
be
adopted
either
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
higher
court.
now,
the
effect
of
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
to
call
these
federal
questions
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
had,
i
submit,
this
effect.
none
of
these
questions
had
to
be
considered
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
under
california
practice.
they
were
not
considered
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
on
what
would
have
been
a
perfectly
proper
ground
and
not
having
been
to
say
it
--
considered,
not
having
been
decided,
this
court,
i
think
has
no
right
to
consider.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
i
can't
say
that
that
is
true
on
the
basis
of
the
decisions.
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
when
they
had
completed
these
factual
allegations
that
they
should
have
indicated
in
their
--
in
their
complaint
and
certainly
it
would
have
been
appropriate
if
not
required
that
as
a
result
of
these
facts
which
they
set
forth,
that
there
arose
these
effects
with
regard
to
the
constitution
--
constitution
of
the
united
states.
they
--
the
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
irving
m.
walker
i
do
not
have
them
and
i
don't
believe
they
exist.
this
court
has
said
on
various
occasions
that
these
matters
must
be
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
its
indicated
in
places
that
--
in
times
that
they
should
be
in
the
pleadings,
but
i
can't
say
that
this
court
has
made
a
positive
statement
to
that
effect
either.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
the
first
time
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
do
it,
i
think,
would
have
been
upon
the
presentation
of
their
case
in
connection
with
the
demurrer.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
if
it
is
well
pleaded.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes.
and
as
i
say
these
federal
questions
may
lurk
--
some
federal
questions
may
lurk
in
these
allegations
but
unless
the
court,
trial
court's
attention
is
called
to
the
fact
that
these
are
the
questions
involved.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
have
been
presented
to
the
court
for
decision.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
i
think
not
within
the
context
of
the
--
of
the
trial
court's
memorandum
opinion.
he
was
dealing
entirely
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
necessary
for
the
plaintiffs
to
show
that
the
action
of
the
defendants
was
not
justified.
and
it
was
only
as
a
part
of
that
discussion
that
he
went
into
this
question
and
then
applied
it
in
one
particular
to
the
group
of
defendants
who
had
not
appeared
before
the
court
and
said,
“of
course,
it
could
have
no
application
to
them
because
they
were
never
placed
in
a
position
where
they
had
to
exercise
or
consider
the
exercise
of
their
federal
privilege
for
their
constitutional
privilege.”
mr.
irving
m.
walker
but
i
--
mr.
irving
m.
walker
did
not
discuss
them.
did
not
pass
upon
them,
was
necessary
to
its
decision
which
was
a
decision
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not
stated
the
cause
of
action
because
they
had
not
made
allegations
that
were
sufficient
to
show
that
the
action
of
the
defendants
was
not
justified.
now,
in
the
district
court
and
i'm
referring
to
the
opening
brief
of
the
plaintiffs
and
it
was
their
obligation,
if
they
were
going
to
raise
these
constitutional
questions
to
raise
them
in
their
opening
brief
not
in
their
reply
brief
but
in
their
opening
brief
under
the
california
procedure.
there
appears,
and
it
is
my
contention
that
these
questions
were
not
presented
properly
to
the
district
court
of
appeals,
that
court
therefore,
could
refuse
them
just
as
it
could
because
they
had
not
been
raised
in
time.
on
page
7
of
the
opening
brief
of
petitioners,
the
district
court,
there
is
a
heading.
the
judgments
by
the
court
below
sustaining
the
demurrers,
to
the
complaint
and
dismissing
the
action
without
trial
deprived
appellants
of
their
liberties
and
properties
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
due
process
provisions
of
the
california
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
there,
the
proposition
that
is
presented
if
there
has
been
--
they
have
been
deprived
of
due
procedural
process
and
of
course,
there
could
be
no
soundness
in
my
humble
opinion
to
such
a
proposition
which
is
not
urged
now
for
such
a
proposition.
because
they
had
proceeded
as
required
under
the
california
law
and
filed
their
complaint,
fought
the
defendants
in
the
court
and
the
ordinary
steps
have
been
taken
that
were
proper
under
the
procedure
of
california,
resulting
in
this
sustaining
of
the
demurrer
without
leave
to
amend
and
in
the
judgment.
i
should
add
that
there
was
no
determination
or
discussion
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
of
any
of
these
questions
and
as
i
have
said,
it
would
have
been
justified
and
not
discussing
them
because
they
were
not
presented
in
the
trial
court
and
because
they
were
not
truly
presented
in
the
opening
brief
because
following,
even
this
end
to
which
i
have
called
the
court's
attention.
there
is
no
discussion
of
these
questions
as
constitutional
questions
as
such.
the
district
court
of
appeals
rendered
its
judgment
on
what
is
apparent
obviously
i
should
say
a
question
of
california
state
law
and
a
question
that
is
in
independent
ground,
an
inadequate
ground
under
the
state
law.
now,
these
questions
were
brought
up
or
some
of
them
at
least
were
brought
up
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
as
already
stated,
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied
without
comment.
it's
also
stated,
the
same
objections
were
raised
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
in
their
answer
to
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
same
situation
existed
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
yes
--
yes,
your
honor,
at
length.
mr.
irving
m.
walker
at
--
at
length,
your
honor,
at
--
at
length
your
honor
yes.
i
shall
only
deal
for
a
moment
so
as
to
save
the
time
for
mr.
selvin
with
the
proposition
that
the
decision
was
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
for
the
decision
that
it
was
not
simply
an
effort
to
evade
any
federal
question.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statement
of
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
which
is
attached
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
the
complaint
in
the
case
of
bar
is
devoid
of
any
allegation
of
fact
that
any
contract
or
relationship
would
have
been
entered
into
between
anyone
of
plaintiffs
and
anyone
of
the
defendant,
motion
picture
producers
and
distributors
or
with
anyone
in
the
motion
picture
industry,
but
for
the
alleged
agreement.
there
is
no
factual
showing
of
denial
of
employment.
there
is
no
allegation
that
at
the
time
the
agreement
was
made
or
at
anytime
thereafter.
anyone
of
the
plaintiffs
was
an
employee
of
anyone
of
the
defendants
or
had
any
reasonable
prospect
of
becoming
such
or
that
anyone
of
them,
was
or
is
or
had
any
prospect
of
being
a
producer
of
motion
pictures.
there's
not
even
an
allegation
that
there
were
any
negotiations
pending
or
that
any
plaintiff
was
seeking
employment
in
the
industry
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
tortuous
interference.
there
is
no
allegation
that
at
anytime
after
the
making
of
the
agreement,
anyone
of
plaintiff's
requested
employment
from
anyone
of
the
defendants
or
from
anyone
in
the
motion
picture
industry.
it
is
not
alleged
that
what
for
defendants
alleged
interference.
anyone
of
plaintiffs
would
or
even
probably
or
possibly
would
have
been
employed
in
the
industry.
at
the
oral
argument,
counsel
for
plaintiffs
conceded
it
was
not
alleged
that
individual
plaintiffs
did
apply
for
work
and
were
denied
the
right
to
work.
so
far
as
it
appears,
the
last
efforts
of
plaintiffs
to
obtain
employment
may
have
occurred
years
before
the
agreement.
all
that
is
alleged
is
that
at
some
unspecified
time
prior
to
the
agreement
they
have
been
so
employed.
when
and
why
that
employment
was
terminated
is
not
alleged.
since
the
employment
terminated
some
time
before
the
agreement
in
the
absence
of
contrary
allegation,
the
inference
necessarily
is
that
the
termination
was
a
result
of
facts,
wholly
disconnected
from
the
agreement
and
that
those
facts
whatever
they
may
have
been
are
still
effect
--
still
are
effective.
it
cannot
be
inferred
from
the
alleged
facts
that
at
some
unspecified
time,
prior
to
the
agreement,
plaintiffs
were
employed
in
the
motion
picture
industry.
they
have
not
obtained
employment
since
they
invoked
their
constitutional
privilege
solely
because
of
that
fact.
thank
you,
your
honors.
