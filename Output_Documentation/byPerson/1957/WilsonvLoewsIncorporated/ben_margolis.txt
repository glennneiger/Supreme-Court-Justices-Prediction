mr.
ben
margolis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
was
based
upon
the
assumption
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleged
interference
with
a
specific
contract
or
a
specific
business
relationship.
a
reading
of
the
complaint
makes
it
readily
apparent
that
the
unambiguous
allegations
of
the
complaint
charge
not
interference
with
a
specific
contract
or
a
specific
business
relationship
but
rather
alleged
total
exclusion
from
the
opportunity
to
work
from
the
right
to
pursue
a
calling.
what
they
alleged
in
fact,
we
assert,
is
total
exclusion
from
entry
into
the
marketplace
in
which
contracts
of
employment
and
business
relationships
are
negotiated
and
consummated.
it
is
this
total
exclusion
from
the
marketplace
which
at
one
and
the
same
time
is
the
principle
injury
alleged
and
is
the
coercive
power
used
by
this
monopolistic
combination
to
deprive
the
petitioners
of
other
constitutional
rights.
under
our
system,
individuals
are
not
guaranteed
that
they
will
ever
have
a
specific
contract
or
that
they
will
ever
enter
into
a
specific
business
relationship.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
correct.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
the
way
the
--
the
action
was
instituted
but
it
was
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
constitutional
right
to
pursue
a
calling
that
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
there
would
be
a
question
whether
the
court
--
whether
california
could
constantly
withdraw
all
remedies
for
torts
within
the
meaning
of
the
--
within
the
provisions
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
think
if
california
offered
no
remedy
whatsoever
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
for
deprivation
of
property
rights
which
are
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
by
the
way
the
breach
of
promise
cases
and
those
kinds
of
cases
are
public
policy
cases
and
do
not
involve
property
rights
which
are
necessarily
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
remedy
would
be
under
those
circumstances
but
i
believe
that
the
refusal
to
grant
any
relief
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
whether
we
could
impose
jurisdiction
up
--
but
we
don't
have
that
sort
of
a
situation
here.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
the
state
here,
the
legislature
--
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
correct.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
also,
that
is
--
that
was
part
of
my
answer,
the
rest
of
my
answer
is
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
enforce
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
certain
constitutional
right
simultaneously
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
and
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
and
also
to
enforce
a
right
over
which
the
california
court
clearly
has
jurisdiction.
there's
no
question
about
jurisdiction
here.
what
would
be
the
situation
if
the
legislature
sought
to
take
away
all
jurisdiction
from
the
courts
is
not
something
that
is
before
us
here.
this
court
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
ben
margolis
suing
for
money
and
for
an
injunction,
for
both.
mr.
ben
margolis
many
millions
of
dollars,
i
don't
remember
the
exact
amount.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
ben
margolis
i
think
that
this
is
so
but
the
question
is
--
that
is
not
the
question
involved
here.
the
question
is
whether
it
may
deny
all
remedy.
if
the
denial
here
had
been
based
upon
the
proposition
that
these
individuals
had
sued
for
too
much
money
or
that
the
only
an
injunction
would
be
granted
in
this
sort
of
a
situation
that
the
court
would
grant
only
an
injunction,
and
by
the
way,
that
this
apply
to
all
persons
equally
in
the
same
position
because
we
have
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
point
here
and
there's
also
a
supremacy
point
here.
but
here,
the
point
is
that
what
the
california
court
said
was
here
is
the
subject
over
which
we
do
have
jurisdiction.
there's
no
contention
that
they
don't
have
jurisdiction.
we
will
not
condition
relief
upon
some
procedural
step
upon
you're
limiting
your
claim
for
damages,
upon
you're
asking
only
for
a
certain
kind
of
relief,
we
say
that
you
--
you
are
totally
excluded
from
all
relief.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
right,
but
that
isn't
the
procedural
step.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
i
think
what
is
involved
here
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
by
creating
this
requirement
of
standing,
they
have
taken
all
way
all
remedies
from
these
people
and
by
taking
away
all
remedies
from
the
petitioners
have
denied
them
the
constitutional
rights.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
correct.
we're
arguing
that
it's
about
a
bona
fide
state
ground.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
right.
mr.
ben
margolis
regardless
of
whether
it
could
withdraw
all
torts
from
its
courts,
it
hasn't
done
so.
and
it
has
said
to
the
citizens
of
the
state,
"we
will
protect
you
when
you
are
injured
by
the
wrongful
acts
of
others
including
this
kind
of
a
tort."
but
it
has
now
said
this
is
one
group
from
which
we
withdraw
this.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
remedy
but
this
remedy
is
being
denied
these
people
on
a
purely
arbitrary
and
capricious
ground,
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
as
my
argument
goes
on.
mr.
ben
margolis
not
in
cognate
cases.
mr.
ben
margolis
no,
no.
i
--
mr.
ben
margolis
your
--
your
honor
will
recall,
perhaps,
that
in
parker
versus
lester,
and
i
think
your
honor
wrote
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
referred
to
the
fact
that
a
case
could
safely
be
sent
back
to
the
california
supreme
court
because
that
court
had
been
diligent
in
its
protection
of
the
civil
liberties
of
its
citizen.
and
you
cited
as
evidence
of
that
fact
the
case
of
james
versus
marinship.
now,
the
case
of
james
versus
marinship
happens
to
be
a
case
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
spoke
most
eloquently
and
most
forcefully
of
the
fact
that
in
the
state
of
california,
the
right
to
work
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
extending
to
all
and
that
the
state
of
california
will
protect
that
right.
so
we
are
dealing
here
--
mr.
ben
margolis
it
--
but
there
wasn't
any
--
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
what
we
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
have
here.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
what
we
have
here.
we
have
total
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
let
me
say
this.
when
you're
suing
for
the
right
to
pursue
a
calling,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
the
right
to
enter
the
marketplace
in
order
to
compete,
in
order
to
obtain
a
contract
or
in
order
to
obtain
a
business
relationship,
it
is
simply
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
achieved
that
business
relationship
before
you
can
enter
the
marketplace.
mr.
ben
margolis
they
read
--
no,
what
they
said
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
a
contract.
how
can
one
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
a
contract
if
he
is
completely
foreclosed
from
entering
the
marketplace
and
negotiating
or
attempting
to
negotiate?
mr.
ben
margolis
but
on
the
admitted
facts
here
--
you
see,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
not
with
some
other
case.
the
admitted
facts
here
are
number
one,
that
these
people
are
people
of
high
standing
and
high
reputation
in
the
industry,
number
two,
that
these
people
have
been
excluded
from
any
opportunity
to
achieve
a
contract
solely
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
appeared
before
a
federal
forum
and
exercise
their
right
as
witnesses
in
the
matter
that
has
been
indicated.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
not
the
remedy
we
are
seeking.
mr.
ben
margolis
no.
we're
not
--
we're
not
seeking
but
we
could
get
damages
for
their
concerted
refusal
to
permit
these
people
to
enter
the
marketplace
and
we
could
get
an
injunction
against
this
concerted
action
and
that
is
the
remedy
that
we
are
seeking.
mr.
ben
margolis
in
this
case,
the
marketplace
is
the
entire
motion-picture
industry
in
the
united
states.
what
these
respondents
have
done,
these
respondents
who
control
all
employment
opportunities
in
the
motion-picture
industry
have
said,
“we
will
not
employ
any
of
these
people
and
we
will
not
permit
anyone
else
in
the
motion-picture
industry
to
employ
any
of
these
people.”
so
that
they
have
closed
all
opportunities
for
these
petitioners
to
pursue
their
calling
to
obtain
any
employment
within
the
industry.
that
is
the
basis
for
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
ben
margolis
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
ben
margolis
no,
i
--
i
understood
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
simply
ask
me
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
california
has
to
grant
a
tort
remedy.
and
i
answer
that
in
my
--
in
my
opinion
was
in
the
affirmative.
however,
our
case
does
not
depend
solely
on
that.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
we
have
a
number
of
points.
let
me
turn
to
one
of
the
points
then
that
this
does
not
depend
at
all
upon
that.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is,
of
course
--
mr.
ben
margolis
we
have
--
i
--
i'm
sorry
that
i
was
not
clear.
i
thought
that
i
have
said
that
we
have
grounds
which
existed
independently
of
whether
or
not
the
state
could
withdraw
the
tort
remedy.
there
are
supreme
--
some
supreme
court
cases
that
we
have
cited
which
say
that
the
withdrawal
of
all
remedies
constitutes
a
denial
of
due
process.
that's
only
one
of
our
problems.
mr.
ben
margolis
and
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
there
are
two
points
that
we
have
which
--
at
least
two
points
that
relate
to
your
question.
the
first
is
our
claim
that
there
has
been
here
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now,
here,
the
state
does
afford
a
remedy
and,
of
course,
i
need
not
argue
to
this
court
that
where
it
does
afford
a
remedy,
it
may
not
make
arbitrary
classifications
or
unreasonable
classifications
between
the
people
to
which
it
does
afford
a
remedy.
now,
here,
the
state,
under
the
supreme
--
under
the
--
under
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
james
versus
marinship
and
others
has
held,
and
this
is
binding
upon
the
district
court
of
appeal,
it
has
never
been
reversed,
has
held
that
the
right
to
work,
the
right
to
pursue
a
calling
as
such
is
protected
under
california
law.
the
effect
of
this
decision
is
to
place
in
one
category
those
who
do
have
contracts
and
say
that
they
may
protect
their
right
to
have
--
to
pursue
--
do
have
contracts
or
reasonable
prospects
of
contracts
and
say
that
they
may
protect
their
rights
to
pursue
a
calling.
but
to
place
in
another
category
those
who
have
been
totally
excluded
from
any
opportunity
of
obtaining
contract
by
the
action
of
these
respondents
and
say
that
they
--
because
they
do
not
have
any
contract
or
do
not
have
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
obtaining
contract
that
therefore,
they
are
excluded
from
pursuing
their
right
to
a
calling
or
--
or
at
least
having
that
right
protected
in
the
federal
court
in
the
--
in
the
state
court
either
by
an
action
for
damages,
by
injunctive
relief
or
in
any
other
way.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
no.
no,
this
is
an
--
i
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
try
to
make
it
clear,
mr.--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
this
is
--
this
does
not
depend
upon
whether
the
state
has
the
power
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
to
withdraw
all
court
remedies.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
--
that
is
my
position.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
where
--
where
the
right
to
work
and
the
right
to
pursue
a
calling
is
protected
by
state
laws,
as
it
is
here.
in
--
in
those
situations
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
at
least,
let
me
say
this,
that
it
strengthens
our
case
and
we
do
have
that
here.
it
strengthens
our
case
and
we
do
have
that
here.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
correct.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
right.
and
here
to
say
that
one
must
have
a
contract
which
he
has
been
precluded
by
the
wrongful
act
of
another
from
having
any
possibility
of
opinion
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
pursue
a
calling
is
simply
irrational.
it
just
has
no
relationship
to
the
protection
of
the
right
involved.
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
my
provision
in
this
situation,
yes.
also,
there
is
involved
this
particular
problem
here
which
maybe
another
way
of
putting
the
same
point.
the
district
court
of
appeal
did
not
purport
to
change
the
law
of
california
with
regard
to
the
protection
of
the
right
to
work.
it
simply
refuse
to
apply
the
established
law
which
protects
the
right
of
--
the
right
to
work
in
the
state
of
california
to
these
petitioners
and
to
select
these
petitioners
and
to
refuse
to
apply
to
them
rights
which
are
protected
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
california
is
also
another
basis
for
arguing
that
this
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now,
the
second
point
which
has
no
relationship
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
case
of
like
--
the
--
the
leading
case
in
california
is
the
case
of
--
that
i
referred
to
before,
james
versus
marinship
and
there,
the
right
--
they
speak
of
the
right
to
work
and
they
speak
of
it
without
any
reference.
and
it's
quite
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
contract
that
has
no
reference
to
the
existence
of
contract
or
the
nonexistence
of
a
contract.
it's
the
right
to
work
in
the
--
in
the
manner
that
the
phrase
was
used
in
truax
versus
corrigan
which
doesn't
depend
upon
the
--
having
a
contract
but
which
is
--
which
means
the
right
to
--
to
compete
for
jobs,
to
try
to
obtain
employment
on
equal
terms
without
--
without
discrimination
under
the
law
or
from
private
combinations
of
this
kind.
now,
also
--
and
prior
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
ben
margolis
i
think
that
while
truax
versus
corrigan
in
many
ways
is
a
bad
case
that
there
are
some
of
the
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
there
are
some
other
principles
in
it
that
i
still
allow
and
i'm
relying
upon
those
principles,
not
the
others.
i
turn
out
to
another
ground
which
is
totally
independent,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
state
may
be
totally
deprived
as
citizens
of
all
tort
remedies
for
a
particular
wrong.
it
is
our
claim
that
the
effect
of
the
state
court
judgment
is
to
ignore
and
to
violate
the
provision
of
the
constitution
making
the
constitution
--
the
federal
constitution
and
the
laws
thereunder,
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
now,
this
has
been
treated
in
respondents'
brief
as
though
all
we
were
relying
upon
were
the
fact
that
the
action
taken
against
these
petitioners
resulted
from
their
claim
of
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
is
not
accurate.
the
situation
is
as
follows.
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
under
the
constitution
that
has
been
held
by
this
court,
has
the
power
to
investigate.
pursuant
to
that
power,
congress
has
enacted
a
series
of
laws
giving
congress
the
power
to
subpoena
witnesses,
requiring
them
to
testify,
establishing
penalties
for
their
refusal
to
testify
and
setting
up
a
whole
body
of
relationships
between
the
witnesses
and
congress,
which
body
of
relationship
has
been
supplemented
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
some
of
them
last
term,
holding
that
the
various
federal
guarantees
of
the
first
and
the
fifth
amendment
and
other
guarantees
applicable
to
persons
generally
apply
in
--
to
witnesses
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
legislative
hearing.
now,
it
is
this
entire
body
of
rights
and
duties
of
witnesses
which
we
say
constitute
to
supreme
law
of
the
land.
the
issue
between
the
parties
here
is
a
relatively
narrow
and
we
think
simple
one.
the
respondents
take
the
position
that
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
does
not
apply
here
because
the
only
interference,
the
only
retaliation
against
these
witnesses
came
from
private
sources.
in
the
first
place,
and
this,
i
think,
is
perhaps
the
least
important
answer
to
this,
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
the
fact
as
alleged
in
the
pleadings
and
as
admitted.
it
is
alleged
in
the
pleadings
that
this
was
a
conspiracy
involving
federal
officials,
that
is
officials
of
the
federal
government,
acting
jointly
with
a
private
monopoly
combination.
now,
whatever
else
maybe
said,
it
would
seem
quite
clear
that
the
supremacy
clause
is
certainly
--
certainly
makes
the
laws
and
constitution
of
the
united
states
binding
on
federal
officials
and
binding
upon
those
acting
in
conjunction
with
them
in
a
conspiracy
to
violate
persons
because
of
their
exercise
of
federally
protected
right.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
--
mr.
ben
margolis
in
this
federal
tort
action
in
which
we
are
complaining
of
the
violation
of
the
right
to
work,
the
taking
away
--
the
injury
is
the
taking
away
of
the
right
to
work
and
the
interference
with
other
constitutional
right.
the
court,
in
applying
the
law,
has
the
duty
to
apply
the
law
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
will
be
injured
because
of
its
exercise
of
federally
protected
rights,
of
its
rights
protected
by
the
laws
--
mr.
ben
margolis
that
is
our
point.
mr.
ben
margolis
we
make
that
point
also.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
here,
we
have
--
we
don't
have
just
civilians
but
we
have
a
combination.
but
our
point
is
that
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
for
the
federal
government
and
federal
officials,
by
the
state
government
and
state
official
and
for
private
individuals
that
--
mr.
ben
margolis
precisely.
mr.
ben
margolis
charges
joint
action
and
joint
intent.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
what
the
charge
is.
mr.
ben
margolis
a
complaint
charges
a
single
conspiracy
to
which
the
members
of
the
committee,
the
investigator
and
this
monopolistic
combination
of
party.
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
i
think
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
a
single
agreement,
yes.
we
struck
the
word
"conspiracy"
but
what
is
left
is
agreement
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
and
a
conspiracy
is
an
agreement
to
do
a
certain
kind
of
an
action.
mr.
ben
margolis
the
only
reason
that
the
word
"conspiracy"
was
stricken
was
because
during
the
course
under
california
law,
it
has
been
time
and
time
again
held
that
the
word
"agreement"
is
not
a
conclusion.
it
was
argued
however
before
the
trial
court
that
the
word
"conspiracy"
and
the
word
"black
list",
which
appeared
in
the
complaint,
were
conclusions.
we
didn't
agree
with
that
and
we
did
not
know
when
the
court
sustained
the
original
demurrer
what
his
grounds
were
for
sustaining
the
demurrer.
but
this
argument
had
been
made
and
during
the
course
of
the
--
of
the
argument
the
judge
had
seemed
to
give
attentive
ear
to
this
contention
with
which
we
disagreed.
we
try
to
meet
this
objection
and
we
think
we
left
our
complaint
in
substantially
the
same
form
and
meaning
substantially
the
same
thing
by
striking
these
--
these
words
which
we
thought
that
the
judge
held
were
conclusions
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
actually
work.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
it
alleged
a
joint
agreement
and
a
mutual
impair.
and
as
i
say,
i
understand
conspiracy
to
mean
precisely
that.
our
last
point
is
that
there
has
been
a
denial
of
due
process
here.
by
the
state
sanctioning,
a
private
monopoly,
together
with
members
of
a
federal
committee
engaging
in
a
joint
agreement
and
course
of
action
designed
to
deny
to
individuals
the
right
to
pursue
a
calling
because
they
had
exercised
their
constitutional
guarantees
as
witnesses
before
a
federal
committee
and
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
their
political
ideas
and
association
and
for
the
further
purpose
of
controlling
the
content
of
motion-picture.
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
sanctioning
of
this
kind
of
monopolistic
control
of
the
right
to
enter
a
calling
based
upon
the
surrender
of
constitutional
rights
constitutes
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
here
once
more,
we
are
not
concern
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
could
take
away
all
tort
remedies
from
everybody.
the
question
here
is
whether
this
monopoly
which
control
all
employment
opportunities
in
an
entire
industry
may
in
effect
set
itself
up
as
a
licensing
agency
and
determine
who
may
and
who
may
not
enter
into
a
particular
calling
and
may,
in
the
process
of
doing
so,
establish
conditions
calling
for
surrender
of
constitutional
rights
which
must
be
met
before
access
to
that
particular
calling
will
be
permitted.
here,
we
have
the
sole
point
that
has
been
raised
that
there
is
a
no
state
action.
it
is
our
assertion,
our
position
that
the
state
of
california
acted
when
it
dismissed
the
complaint
here
and
the
state
of
california
acted
when
the
court
--
district
court
of
appeal
wrote
an
opinion
establishing
a
policy
of
law,
a
policy
of
law
that
private
monopolies
have
this
power
and
that
they
may
do
these
things
and
that
the
state
will
permit
this
to
be
done
without
affording
its
citizens
any
protection
whatsoever.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
very
much
like
the
case
of
marsh
versus
alabama,
that
where
a
private
combination
arrogates
onto
itself
the
kind
of
powers
which
belong
to
the
government,
there
was
the
running
of
a
power.
here,
it
was
the
--
it
is
the
determination
of
what
the
conditions
are
or
what
the
prerequisites
are
for
entering
into
a
calling
for
having
the
right
to
work.
we
say
that
there
is
no
greater
right
in
a
private
monopoly
combination
to
run
a
town
or
to
control
who
may
enter
a
calling
than
there
is
in
such
a
combination
to
operate
a
town
and
to
utilize
that
town
as
a
means
of
depriving
people
of
their
constitutional
right.
in
effect,
what
they
have
done
here
is
to
set
up
this
monopoly
as
a
licensing
agent.
and
what
they
have
said
to
this
monopoly
is
you
are
free
to
bar
from
the
profession
anybody
that
you
want
to
bar
from
entering
into
this
industry
for
any
purpose
that
you
desire,
for
any
reason
at
all
as
long
as
that
person
does
not
already
have
a
contract
or
a
reasonable
prospect
of
a
contract.
now,
if
this
is
the
law,
then
this
monopoly
can
say,
"we
will
not
take
any
of
the
graduates
of
a
particular
university
because
the
president
of
that
university
has
criticized
the
motion-picture
industry
and
has
injured
the
motion-picture
industry
and
we
will
not
take
any
graduates
from
any
university
in
the
future
where
there
is
any
criticism
of
the
motion-picture
industry,"
and
there
would
be
no
wrong
which
the
state
was
bound
to
protect
under
the
due
process
clause
because
the
students
graduating
from
that
--
those
colleges
obviously
did
not
yet
have
contracts
or
prospects
of
contracts
of
employment
or
this
monopoly
could
exclude
absolutely
any
political,
any
religious,
any
national,
any
social
group
which,
at
any
particular
time,
was
unpopular
as
long
as
the
member
of
that
group
did
not
already
have
a
contract
or
reasonable
prospect
of
a
contract
and
could
exclude
them
on
whatever
ground
the
industry
choose
but
the
grounds
here
being
that
the
employment
of
such
people
by
one
person
in
the
industry
would
injure
other
members
of
the
industry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
would
give
a
private
monopoly
complete
unequivocal
control
of
all
opportunity
to
determine
who
may
or
who
may
not
work
in
an
entire
industry
in
the
united
states.
it
is
our
position
that
to
the
extent
that
such
powers
may
be
exercise
at
all,
they
belong
to
the
state
and
that
even
when
the
state
lays
down
requirements
for
entry
into
a
profession,
witness
the
konigsberg
case,
that
state
may
not
lay
down
unreasonable
qualifications.
no
more
may
a
private
industry
--
industrial
combination
exercising
monopoly
powers
in
effect
state
powers
lay
down
unreasonable
and
unconstitutional
conditions
for
entry
into
a
calling
assuming
arguendo
that
they
have
the
right
to
lay
down
any
conditions
whatsoever.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
would
say
this
that
if
all
of
the
--
if
there
was
a
combination
and
conspiracy
of
the
kind
charged
here
which
totally
excluded
all
people
of
a
certain
nationality
or
group
from
the
entire
opportunity
to
pursue
a
calling
that
there
would
be
a
remedy.
but
the
f.e.p.c.
legislation
is
directed,
as
i
understand
it,
against
individual
acts
of
individual
employers.
we
are
not
acting
for
a
remedy
against
individual
acts
of
individual
employer.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
there
was
a
great
distinction
between
what
a
private
employer
may
do
in
determining
who
he
will
hire
and
will
not
hire
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
between
what
a
combination
which
employ
--
which
controls
all
employment
opportunities
within
entire
huge
industries
if
you
go
throughout
the
united
states
may
do.
the
private
employer
may
--
mr.
ben
margolis
it
may
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
law
--
mr.
ben
margolis
it
may
be
a
violation
of
that
but
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
our
contention
is
that
when
a
monopolistic
combination
sets
itself
up
in
this
manner
and
not
only
agrees
among
its
own
members
that
it
will
not
hire
certain
persons
but
persuade
every
other
employer
in
the
industry
not
to
hire
certain
persons
that
this
combination
asserting
itself
up
as
a
kind
of
super
government.
it
is
exercising
governmental
power
just
as
surely
as
the
corporation
in
marsh
versus
alabama
was
exercising
governmental
powers
when
around
a
town.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
i
mean.
suppose
that
in
the
konigsberg
case
--
mr.
ben
margolis
well,
let
me
--
that
was
my
understanding
or
one
of
the
basis.
but
let
me
give
--
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
i
mean,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
let's
take
the
konigsberg
case.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
understand
that,
of
course.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
understand
that,
of
course.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
i
wanted
to
give
your
honor
an
example
of
--
in
relation
to
the
konigsberg
case.
the
konigsberg
case
was
one
in
which
the
state
of
california,
by
its
action,
denied
entry
to
the
profession
of
law.
suppose
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
california,
a
private
organization
was
permitted
to
determine
who
should
practice
law,
suppose
they
were
permitted
to
do
that,
would
a
--
that
private
organization,
without
any
review
to
the
court,
would
that
private
organization's
denial
of
konigsberg's
right
to
practice
be
any
less
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause
then
was
the
violation
by
--
mr.
ben
margolis
few
moments
as
to
how
these
questions
were
raised,
if
the
court
please.
we
heard
nothing
about
the
supremacy
point
from
counsel.
now,
as
far
as
the
supremacy
point
is
concerned,
the
trial
judge
discussed
that
in
his
opinion
and
said
in
effect
that
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
as
applied,
nevertheless
required
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
so,
it
was
considered
and
was
passed
on
by
the
trial
court.
it
was
raised
specifically
on
page
26
of
the
opening
brief.
it
was
raised
again
on
the
petition
for
rehearing.
so,
this
has
been
raised
throughout.
now,
let
us
take
due
process
and
equal
protection.
mr.
ben
margolis
the
supremacy
point,
supreme
law
of
the
land.
now,
let
us
take
due
process
and
equal
protection.
contrary
to
what
counsel
has
served
--
mr.
ben
margolis
the
point
(voice
overlap)
--
the
failure
to
(voice
overlap)
i'm
--
i'm
trying
it
shorthand.
the
failure
to
apply
the
supreme
court
--
the
supreme
--
the
failure
to
apply
enforce
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
federal
right
is
what
i'm
talking
about,
the
rights
of
--
right
of
--
the
rights
of
these
people
as
witnesses
to
perform
their
duties
as
witnesses
without
injury
from
any
source.
mr.
ben
margolis
the
district
--
the
--
the
district
court
of
appeals
have
not
considered
but
they
were
raised
--
they're
in
the
pleading
--
the
pleadings
assert
that
these
people
were
being
punished
by
the
combination
or
being
injured
by
the
combination
because
of
their
exercise
of
their
rights
of
witnesses
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
it's
on
page
26
of
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
federal
--
with
respect
to
the
supremacy
clause.
now,
i
wanted
to
--
mr.
ben
margolis
but
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
we
spell
out
what
those
federal
rights
are.
mr.
ben
margolis
nobody
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
well,
it
set
forth
--
it
is
clearly
set
forth
in
the
complaint
--
mr.
ben
margolis
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
ben
margolis
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
read
it
because
i
want
to
move
on
to
some
other
things
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
all
we
were
required
to
do
in
the
complaint
was
to
allege
of
the
fact
upon
which
our
federal
--
mr.
ben
margolis
no.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
--
mr.
ben
margolis
the
superior
court
in
considering
the
issue
of
justification
discussed
the
question
of
the
federal
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
federal
rights
as
a
witness.
mr.
ben
margolis
you
file
a
brief
on
appeal.
mr.
ben
margolis
just
that
--
mr.
ben
margolis
you
said
--
well,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
specific
statement
of
questions.
you
have
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
and
this
was
done.
mr.
ben
margolis
now,
insofar
as
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
--
and
due
process
are
concerned,
it
is
our
position
that
these
arose
out
of
the
action
of
the
court,
not
only
in
dismissing
the
complaint
but
on
the
grounds
on
which
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
for
example,
in
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
ruled
in
our
favor
insofar
as
the
cause
of
action
being
one
for
the
right
to
work
and
not
requiring
a
specific
contract.
that
was
in
our
faith.
it
ruled
against
us
on
the
issue
of
justification,
should
we
then
have
moved
for
reconsideration
and
said
to
the
trial
court,
"if
you
had
ruled
against
us
on
the
issue
of
the
necessity
for
a
contract,
you
would
have
denied
us
our
constitutional
rights."
that's
--
that's
the
kind
of
a
motion
for
reconsideration
we
would
have
had
to
make.
we
would
have
had
to
say,
if
you
had
ruled
differently
than
you
did
rule.
if
your
grounds
for
your
ruling
had
been
different,
then
you
would
have
denied
us
of
these
constitutional
rights.
when
we
went
up
on
appeal,
we
claim
that
there
were
certain
constitutional
rights
involved
in
the
issue
of
justification
and
we
urged
those
constitutional
rights,
due
process
and
equal
protection
but
in
the
light
of
the
trial
court's
ruling,
the
trial
court
up
to
that
point
having
ruled
in
our
favor,
insofar
as
the
point
now
before
this
court
is
concerned.
the
first
time
--
the
first
time
that
we
knew
that
the
--
that
any
state
of
california,
any
court
of
the
state
of
california
was
going
to
require
a
contract
as
a
condition
of
enforcing
this
right
was
when
the
district
court
of
appeal
handed
down
its
decision.
and
what
did
we
have
to
anticipate?
number
one,
that
they
will
treat
our
complaint
which
is
based
upon
their
right
to
work
as
though
it
were
based
upon
violation
of
a
specific
contract
--
mr.
ben
margolis
the
specific
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeal
on
the
grounds
upon
which
it
is
based.
that
is
the
specific
and
--
and
we
just
have
no
way
of
knowing
before
that
that
they
would
disregard
the
right
to
work.
mr.
ben
margolis
the
first
opportunity
we
have
--
the
first
time
that
we
knew
that
--
that
those
questions
are
rolled.
the
supremacy
point
which
was
present
at
all
times
is
present
in
the
case
at
all
times.
it
was
raised
at
all
times,
was
considered
by
the
trial
court
and
was
raised
in
our
briefs.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
we
have
these
adequate
matters
which
we
could
answer
which
shall
adequately
answered
in
our
brief.
mr.
ben
margolis
the
superior
court
did
not
so
ruled,
it
ruled
the
other
way.
that's
the
point.
the
--
the
superior
court
ruled
the
other
way
on
this
point.
the
district
court
appeal
was
the
first
court.
mr.
ben
margolis
the
superior
court
rule
that
it
appeared
from
the
face
of
the
pleadings,
it
--
it
ruled
first
of
all,
that
there
--
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
loss
of
the
right
to
work,
pleaded
here.
but
it
said
that
there
can
be
there
can
be
justification.
it
is
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
show
--
to
show
lack
of
justification
in
the
complaint
that
the
complaint
on
its
face
did
not
show
such
lack
of
justification.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
superior
court's
ruling.
it
had
ruled
in
our
favor
on
the
point
that
the
district
court
of
appeal
later
ruled
against
us
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
it's
in
there.
i
think
it's
the
--
what's
it?
mr.
kenny,
perhaps,
can
help
me
find
the
specific
page
reference?
i
think
--
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
it
was
affirming,
that
as
far
as
it
was
treating
our
right
as
one
which
existed
regardless
of
contract.
your
honor,
will
find
it
on
page
45
of
the
--
of
the
record.
now,
there
is
one
--
well,
i
think
my
time
is
up.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
--
mr.
ben
margolis
right.
they
have
to
go
on.
you
see,
they
go
on
to
hold
that
this
--
that
this
is
not
insufficient.
they
considered
the
point.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
the
point
is
that
there
was
no
state
action
against
--
mr.
ben
margolis
the
point
is
that
there
was
no
state
action
against
us
on
those
grounds.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
this
--
mr.
ben
margolis
but
we
have
--
if
we
had
moved
for
reconsideration.
here's
what
we
would
have
had
to
say.
if
you
had
ruled
differently
than
you
ruled,
you
would
have
denied
us
due
process
because
they
had
ruled
that
our
--
that
we
didn't
have
to
have
a
contract.
we
would
have
had
to
say,
if
you
had
ruled
that
we
require
the
contract,
you
would
have
denied
us
due
process
and
equal
protection.
mr.
ben
margolis
but
the
judgment
was
based
entirely
upon
lack
of
justification
which
was
an
independent
ground.
mr.
ben
margolis
(inaudible)
mr.
ben
margolis
well
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
no
think
of
(inaudible)
doesn't
simply
involve
a
question
of,
i
think,
the
issue
was
raised
in
(inaudible)
but
what
happened
was
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
law.
and
--
and
what
the
appellate
court
did
in
(inaudible)
was
to
change
the
law
and
accept
a
contention
which
in
effect
changed
the
law.
now
--
mr.
ben
margolis
we
would
have
had
to
anticipate,
if
the
court
please,
that
our
complaint
would
be
treated
as
alleging
something
entirely
different
than
as
alleged.
and
i
submit
that
we
were
not
required
to
anticipate
that.
mr.
ben
margolis
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
it's
--
it's
printed
and
i
believe
it's
on
file
here.
mr.
ben
margolis
no,
it's
not
printed
in
the
record.
it's
on
--
mr.
ben
margolis
yes,
it's
on
file
here
with
the
clerk.
mr.
ben
margolis
no.
by
--
you
will
just
raise
the
points
in
the
brief
in
your
argument.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
under
the
law
of
california
there
--
mr.
ben
margolis
the
briefs
are
there.
mr.
ben
margolis
they
were
--
mr.
ben
margolis
--
offered
as
part
of
the
record
whether
they
have
been
accepted
as
part
of
the
record
under
the
court's
rule.
i
--
i
don't
know
for
sure.
mr.
ben
margolis
yes.
we
--
we
raised
that
and
we
also
said
that
the
court's
ruling
--
we
said
in
the
--
in
the
appellate
court,
that
the
court's
ruling
denied
us
of
--
of
due
process
and
of
equal
protection.
it
was
argued
in
a
somewhat
different
context
than
it
is
being
argued
now.
but
we
did
argue
that
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
denied
us
due
process
and
equal
protection.
that
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
it
was
argued
in
the
light
of
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
ben
margolis
that's
right.
mr.
ben
margolis
right.
mr.
ben
margolis
right.
mr.
ben
margolis
it
was
challenged
at
every
step
of
the
case.
