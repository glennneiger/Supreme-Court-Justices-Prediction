justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
in
your
case
(inaudible)
on
a
holding
of
this
court
that
california
has
to
give
enforcement
(inaudible)
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
gather
that
from
what
you've
said.
i
--
i
have
so
understood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
came
up
to
this
court
several
times.
the
court
finally
sent
it
back
not
because
california
was
compelled
that
they're
guilty
but
the
(inaudible)
whether
california
is
guilty,
the
assumption
being
that
it
would
give
a
remedy
--
would
have
given
a
remedy
but
for
the
fact
that
it
is
withdrawn,
what
has
been
done
did
not
violate
the
federal
constitution
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
what
you've
been
arguing
up
to
this
time.
i
had
supposed
that
you
would
continue
that
what
they
had
done
was
to
misconstrue
the
federal
constitution
and
hold
that
for
that
reason,
there
was
no
cause
of
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
it
quite
a
different
situation
so
far
as
i
am
concern.
you're
saying
that
you
have
a
right
to
go
into
the
federal
--
state
court
to
enforce
a
court
remedy
where
the
state
refuses
to
give
any.
we
held
in
hood
versus
bell
that
the
federal
courts
maybe
over
but
that
--
did
not
depend
on
whether
it
was
the
state
control
but
--
up
today
in
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter,
you
have
left
me
with
the
impression
that
what
you
are
depending
on
that
the
court
wrongfully
held
that
it
would
not
give
a
remedy
because
there
was
no
contract.
that's
quite
different
from
the
court
saying,
â€œwe
will
not
give
a
remedy
although
we
have
--
we
do
supply
remedy,
we'll
not
give
it
here
because
we
think
that
there
has
been
no
constitutional
or
federal
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
argue
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
this.
if
you
had
showed
that
you're
not
depending
on
that,
would
you
say
the
state
does
give
a
remedy,
if
you
have
that
--
if
that's
your
contention
(inaudible)
of
the
remedy
and
would
have
given
the
remedy
to
these
people,
what's
the
point
of
misconstruction
of
a
federal
constitutional
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
does
not
finally
get
down
to
what
you're
arguing
or
saying
(inaudible)
if
the
state
just
cannot
give
protection
to
a
court
action
of
the
people
who
have
contracts
who
--
who
refuses
to
those
who
have
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
that,
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
--
you
are
saying
that
they
do
allow
a
remedy
even
for
--
or
for
without
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
have
just
denied
them
and
you
are
invoking
now
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
printed
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
raise
objections
when
you're
on
appeal
in
the
appellate
court,
by
assignments
of
error
or
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
in
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
briefs
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
raise
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
raise
it
in
the
appellant
court,
the
superior
court's
decision,
that
you
have
no
cause
of
action
because
you
couldn't
show
justification
on
account
of
the
construction
that
court
gave
to
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
superior
court
according
to
the
record
at
page
46,
you
cited
your
complaint
was
not
good
on
the
ground
that
you
didn't
show,
you
fail
to
show
such
a
refusal
without
justification
under
the
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
said
that
in
order
to
decide
that,
it
had
to
turn
to
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
turn
to
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
gave
its
meaning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then,
what
i'm
asking
is,
if
you
and
your
petition
or
in
your
brief
in
the
supreme
court
and
your
motion
for
--
appellate
court
and
your
motion
for
rehearing
challenge
that
interpretation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
