justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
explaining
a
phrase
you
used
earlier
that
she
was
paroled
into
the
united
states?
isn't
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thing
she
was
--
she
came
in
by
ship,
i
take
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
she
was
physically
detained
at
the
place
of
reception
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
san
francisco
harbor
whatever
--
wherever
that
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
san
francisco,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
then,
go
on
from
there.
what
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
--
on
what
ground
she's
actually
deported?
such
parole
is
--
parole
is
the
technical
term,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what
ground
--
what
ground
it's
asserted?
what
--
what
bases
--
on
what
ground
may
the
power
be
exercised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
that
--
was
that
a
recognized
administrative
discretion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
go
way
back
in
the
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws,
namely
that
people
are
held
one
week
or
other
takes
time
and
they
let
them
out
on
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
there's
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
talking
about
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
implied
--
an
implied
exercise
by
the
immigration
authority,
the
physical
--
the
physical
--
the
opportunity
of
leaving
the
place,
the
physical
detention
to
walk
freely
about
the
streets
of
new
york
to
san
francisco
under
giving
of
a
bond.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
statute?
what
--
what
is
the
statute?
what
chages
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
immediately
just
grab
the
administrative
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
just
--
it
just
recognized
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
implied
that
--
that
she
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
go
to
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
the
implication
that
you
just
stated
it
that
at
any
time
that
the
immigration
authorities
want
physically
to
get
hold
of
the
incoming
person,
he
should
be
made
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
am
i
right
and
i
don't
mean
to
make
any
implication
whatever
on
the
problem
that's
before
us.
and
am
i
right
in
inferring
from
what
you
have
said
that
if
he'd
been
physically
if
he
continued
in
the
physical
custody
of
the
detention
place
in
san
francisco,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
--
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
don't
draw
any
inference
from
that.
i
just
want
to
know
if
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
i
think
is
that
in
a
proper
case,
you
--you
would
have
this
court
to
recognize
the
constitutional
right
of
exile?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
be
noted
that
i
may
have
no
doubt
about
it.
the
statute
that
you
think
is
governing
has
what
precise
words
as
to
the
place
and
from,
a
place
to
which
the
alien
has
to
be
sent.
what
are
the
precise
words
of
the
applicable
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whence
they
came?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
to
be
either
if
she
came
from
hong
kong
that
should
be
awareness.
so,
if
she
came
to
hong
kong
from
china,
that
could
be
awareness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
she
came
without
--
just
in
transit
in
the
technical
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
decisions
--
have
the
decisions
construed
when
she
came
--
when
she
came
to
mean
the
last
port
from
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
it?
what
does
this
argue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
carrier
here
was
a
fellow
--
the
carrier
from
hong
kong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
find
the
--
the
order
of
deportation
is
not
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
--
have
you
(inaudible)
or
i
suppose
that's
the
documents
to
which
we
have
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
i
want
to
know
is
there
a
document
which
specifically
directs
to
what
place
that
indicates
the
geography
of
the
termination
of
the
journey
which
is
commanded
to
be
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
the
one
that's
exhibit
(a)
attached
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
suppose
that
--
there
must
be
some
piece
of
paper
on
which
you
as
their
attorney
have
told
that
she
must
be
taken
by
some
ship
somewhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap)
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
don't
know
where
she
shall
be
--
she
will
be
shipped
to
hong
kong
or
to
china,
mainland.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
document
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
would
tell
me
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
all
a
matter
of
oral
communication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
see
that
that's
the
basis
for
judicial
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
of
course
the
letter
for
you
that
exhibit
(a)
is
there
asking
for
this
(voice
overlap)
persons
who
made
the
letter
(inaudible)
the
decision
based
on
allegation
that
physical
persecution
should
deportation
to
china
be
effective.
what
i
want
to
know
is
suppose
the
government
now
says,
“we
change.
we
will
now
issue
a
formal
order
saying
this
woman
should
be
sent
to
hong
kong.”
after
all,
that
ship
that
brought
her
can't
be
asked
to
take
her
to
china.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
couldn't
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
would
have
to
bear
the
expense
of
taking
her
back
to
hong
kong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
that,
my
question
is,
suppose
the
--
the
inspector
of
the
immigration
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
general
(inaudible)
would
sign
a
piece
of
paper
and
say,
“the
ship
is
to
carry
her
merely
to
hong
kong,”
and
we
have
no
further
interest
what
happens
to
her
after
she
gets
to
hong
kong.
what
will
be
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
depends
whether
arrangements
can
be
made.
that
depends
upon
the
arrangement
between
the
state
department
and
the
government
of
hong
kong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
if
the
government
gets
up,
i'm
not
--
i'm
trying
to
pull
where
this
leads
us
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
difficulty
for
me
is
the
--
the
government
gets
up
and
certainly
it
authorizes
to
say
the
government
was
trying
to
make
arraignments
for
this
woman's
deportation,
physically
carriage
to
hong
kong
and
not
beyond.
you
said
the
case
at
the
bottom
was
up,
out
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you.
if
you
are
right
in
saying
that
if
you
are
merely
sent
to
hong
kong,
you
would
have
no
case.
then,
within
the
united
states,
it
can't
change
the
--
the
reach
of
the
job
with
which
she
can
be
sent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
if
she's
sent
to
--
if
she's
sent
to
china,
she
has
no
--
the
government
may
have
no
right
to
send
her
to
china
no
matter
what
within
the
united
states
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
very
--
that's
a
very
different
case
than
this
enormous
case
of
suggesting
a
constitutional
right
of
entry
to
the
united
state,
whether
the
united
states
want
to
take
them
in
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
until
china
has
a
government
that
we
like,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
narrower
issue
is
that
this
order
is
wrong
so
far
as
there
is
an
order
before
us
and
that
she's
being
sent
to
china
when
she
ought
to
be
sent
to
hong
kong
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
no
matter
what
her
status
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
regardless
if
china
were
a
paradise,
you
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
could
--
how
is
that
--
what
are
the
finances
of
this
thing
if
--
if
an
--
if
an
alien
comes
from
a
port
to
which
alone,
the
government
can
compel
the
carrier
to
take
her,
who
pays
for
the
expense
that's
going
on
from
there
to
the
eventual
land
of
citizenship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
having
the
impression
of
the
phrase
within
the
united
states,
goes
back
to
immigration
legislation
long
before
the
present
difficulty
in
connection
or
that
have
arisen
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
what
the
construction
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
the
phrase
itself
is
an
old
phrase,
is
it
not,
within
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
construction.
i'm
saying
the
fact,
the
words
within
the
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
have
been
in
legislation
and
in
opinion
of
this
court
long
antedating
these
compassionate
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
are
you
saying
that
there
is
outstanding
an
in
--
an
uncontested
legally
valid
order
of
deportation,
that
the
attorney
general
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart
can't
say,
“oh
well,
this
is
a
hard
case.i'll
give
relief,”
but
he
has
no
power
to
do
that,
but
the
congress
in
243
has
given
him
power
under
certain
circumstances
that
you
find
conditionally
and
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
has
ruled
that
this
case
doesn't
come
within
those
conditions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
i
haven't
--
you
haven't
made
clear
to
me
at
least
why
--
why
he
couldn't
act
under
section
212
(d)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
difference
between
212
--
212
(d)
and
--
and
243,
namely
that
212
isn't
restricted
by
whatever
within
the
united
states
may
mean,
whereas
243
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
application
with
212
(d)
was
rejected,
because
as
a
matter
of
--
on
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
attorney
general,
by
the
immigration
federal,
by
the
authorized
officials,
it
was
with
the
suggestion
that
she
would
be
returned
to
a
physically
dangerous
country
which
found
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
why
it
was
rejected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
the
same
--
if
that
--
if
that
would
be
an
allowable
finding
of
fact,
why
are
we
not
discussing
an
abstract
case
here,
in
fact
that
would
equally
buy
him
from
exercising
power
under
243
(h)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
(voice
overlap)
or
it
wasn't
found
with
reason.
if
it
was
found
with
reason
in
212
(d),
it
must
equally
be
available
under
243
(h).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
is
wasn't
founded
in
reason
for
243
(h)
then
although
212
(d)
may
not
be
before
us,
but
it's
not
a
very
attractive
kind
of
a
situation
to
present.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
just
taking
out
of
the
alien
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
you
--
you
baffle
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
attorney
general
has
been
given
under
two
sections
with
the
important
difference
that
you
indicate,
restricted
within
the
other
issue,
this
compassionate
power,
this
power
of
--
of
relief
in
human
situations.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
that's
ought
to
be
exercised
with
the
appropriate
anxiety
with
which
such
a
power
should
be
exercised,
such
a
power
of
mercy.
and
it
troubles
me
to
say
that
it
was
found
unavailable
under
212,
because
she
hasn't
made
out
this
danger,
but
maybe,
she
can
make
it
out
under
243.
that
bothered
me
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
aware
of
that,
but
you
specifically
used
the
language
of
physical
danger?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
ground
would
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
basis
for
judgment
made
in
212
is
the
same
as
the
basis
for
judgment
in
243.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know,
but
other
means
in
addition
to
and
have
excluded
off
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
excluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
still
bothered.
the
more
you
talk
about
saying,
“there
are
all
sorts
of
niceties
of
--
of
technical
judgment
of
the
same
basis
for
judgment,”
the
more
troubled
i
am.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
help
in
this
light.
that
doesn't
help
in
this
light
because
i
don't
want
to
be
pushed
into
giving
a
construction
to
settle
--
to
a
traditional
phrase
like
within
the
united
states,
because
of
what
appears,
the
--
the
way
power
is
not
exercised
under
212
(d).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
is
the
point.
the
immigration
service
isn't
--
we're
not
here
concerned,
at
least
i'm
not
whether
something
will
help
or
harm
some
notions
of
the
immigration
service.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
specific
immigration
statutes
which
it
is
our
duty
to
apply
and
enforce
whether
we
like
them
or
not.
in
the
second
place,
there's
a
long
tradition
of
construction
of
words
--
terms
of
art
in
the
immigration
laws.
and
the
third
place,
the
one
you've
just
indicated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
leads
to
a
very
serious
thing
to
make
a
ruling
and
to
be
asked
to
make
a
ruling,
the
upshot
of
which
will
be,
people
won't
be
led
out
of
the
detention
place,
the
places
of
detention,
because
it
will
then
be
suggested
they're
within
the
united
states,
so
that
a
particular
case
that
may
appeal
to
our
emotion
maybe
of
a
greatest
disservice
to
aliens
coming
into
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
won't
parole
them
a
year
after.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
call
that
a
legal
fiction.
this
--
this
court
had
at
the
beginning
long
before
the
parole
problem
(inaudible)
and
it
has
very
serious
consequences
in
the
kind
of
rights
to
be
accorded
to
a
fellow
who
is
waiting
to
be
--
waiting
at
(inaudible)
to
have
the
authority
to
decide
whether
she'd
be
let
in
or
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
--
the
whole
line
of
cases
from
ju
toy.
the
difference
between
incoming
and
resident
aliens,
the
whole
structure
of
the
immigration
law
is
based
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
disassociate
myself
from
your
notion
that
it's
a
fiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
a
derogatory
sense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
fiction
that
has
no
reality.
it
has
great
reality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
about
this,
because
i
came
on
an
immigrant
ship.
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
whether
you
have
to
stay
on
that
ship
or
allowed
to
go
off
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
that
it
--
that
--
that
it's
a
harsh
term
whether
it's
irrelevant
to
this
court's
determination
of
what
statutes
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
within
the
united
states,
must
either
be
--
have
geographic
content,
must
have
a
geographic
meaning
or
a
traditionally
legally
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we're
not
taking
off
a
ship
and
taking
to
ellis
island.
i
was
then
physically,
geographically
within
the
united
states,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i've
been
allowed
to
land
at
the
(inaudible)
now,
within
the
united
states
in
any
sense,
that
is
read
as
a
geographic
term
and
if
it
isn't
a
geographic
term,
then
it
must
be
a
legal
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
time
you
think
she
arrived
implies
that
it's
a
part
of
a
journey.
was
it
part
of
a
journey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
she
--
i
think
the
other
way
around.
if
she
should
be
sent
to
hong
kong,
then
the
failure
of
the
hong
kong
authorities
or
the
refusal
of
the
hong
kong
authorities
to
receive
her
doesn't
affect
our
power
to
send
her
elsewhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
question
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
i
are
interested
in.
namely,
if
her
sole
journey
to
hong
kong
was
(inaudible)
that
she
should
be
sent
to
hong
kong,
then
i
suggest
she
can't
be
sent
to
china
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
refusal
of
hong
kong
to
take
her,
simply
means
that
the
we've
got
to
keep
her.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said,
the
record
doesn't
enlighten
us
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
charge
--
and
the
allegation
is
made
the
way
i
understand
counsel
for
petitioner,
not
denied
by
the
government
that
that's
really
where
she
established
a
solid
footing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
address
you
that
that's
immaterial
to
our
immediate
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sand,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
take
care
of
--
by
appropriate
memorandum
of
a
couple
in
my
mind.
if
this
record
raises
doubt,
whether
or
not
china
is
the
place
which
on
your
construction
of
statute
within,
she
can
be
and
should
be
sent.
if
that
is
a
matter
of
doubt
on
the
facts,
and
it
may
well
be
that
she
should
--
that
hong
kong
is
the
place
to
which
she
should
be
sent
under
the
statute.
i
don't
--
i'm
saying
it's
a
greater
doubt,
if
the
--
if
that
question
is
served,
then
i
--
i
don't
think
i
want
to
reach
your
problem,
the
statutory
problem,
because
then,
under
a
different
provision
of
the
statute,
she
can't
be
sent
to
china.
and
i
would
like
you
to
say
what
you
have
to
say
dealing
with
what
i
think
has
been
generated
as
a
substantial
doubt
on
that
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
i
understand
all
of
that,
perfectly
clear.
you
made
it
clear.
it
was
clear
before
this
and
you
made
it
clear.
but
the
question
is,
in
my
mind,
that
if
it's
a
matter
of
fact,
she
shouldn't
be
sent
to
china
that
the
place
whence
she
came
is
hong
kong,
then
i
don't
propose
to
consider
the
issue
that
both
of
you
want
me
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
that
the
sufficient
doubt
has
been
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
factual
questions
exist
which
are
not
in
the
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
your
duty
to
put
before
the
court
if
they're
available,
because
questions
of
mootness
do
not
necessarily
have
to
appear
in
the
record.
indeed,
most
of
the
time,
they
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
--
you're
leaving
out
of
account
or
vast
constitutional
difference
between
procedures,
between
exclusion
and
deportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
why
do
you
say
that
they're
--
they're
the
same
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
they're
sent
out,
but
the
--
the
protective
--
the
protection,
the
legal
protection
in
the
case
of
an
incoming
alien
and
one
who
is
here
and
thought
to
be
sent
out
are
vastly
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
don't
say
they're
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
can't
construe
these
statutes
according
to
the
particular
appeal
of
a
particular
case
or
how
close
a
particular
case
on
one
side
of
the
line
comes
to
another
side
of
the
line.
i've
just
indicated
to
you
with
your
agreement
that
the
difference
between
not
letting
a
fellow
come
in
although
he
--
in
ellis
island
or
a
detention
center
in
san
francisco
where
not
and
a
fellow
who's
in
and
is
to
be
deported
is
profound
in
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
although
you
are
saying
they're
the
same
and
yet,
very
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
a
person
comes
in
and
he's
here,
doesn't
mean
that
the
fellow
who
isn't
here,
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
is
here.
