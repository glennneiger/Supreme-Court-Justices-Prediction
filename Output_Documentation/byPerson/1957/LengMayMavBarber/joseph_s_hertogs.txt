mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today,
seeking
reversal
of
a
judgment
entered
in
the
district
court
and
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
in
the
instant
case
was
born
in
china
in
about
1938.
some
time
prior
to
the
communist
invasion,
she
and
other
members
of
the
family
moved
to
hong
kong
and
took
up
residence
in
hong
kong.
in
1951,
when
she
was
12
and
a
half
years
of
age,
her
father
submitted
in
her
behalf
an
application
for
documentation
with
the
american
consulate
general
at
hong
kong.
american
consulate
general
issued
documentation
in
the
case
and
the
girl
proceeded
to
the
port
of
entry
of
san
francisco,
california.
subsequent
to
the
time
of
her
arrival
in
1951,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
determined
that
she
had
failed
to
reasonably
establish
her
claimed
relationship
to
her
citizen
father
and
therefore,
her
claim
to
united
states
nationality.
as
a
result,
they
ordered
her
excluded
and
deported
from
the
united
states
as
an
alien,
not
in
possession
of
a
proper
immigration
visa
authorizing
her
admission
for
permanent
residence.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
she
was
12
and
a
half
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
her
arrival.
during
the
interim,
prosecution
had
taken
place.
the
government
in
the
prosecution
contended
that
the
parents
and
one
other
member
of
the
family
had
committed
perjury
in
a
primary
and
preliminary
statements
made
to
officials
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
those
members
of
the
family
were
indicted
and
they
were
acquitted.however,
during
the
interim,
they
saw
fit
to
parole
her
into
the
united
states.
as
a
result,
the
proceedings
in
the
instant
case
were
not
concluded
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
was
not
arrived
at
until
1953.
in
the
early
part
of
1954,
the
petitioner
received
a
notice
to
surrender
for
deportation
to
communist
china.
and
merely
after
following
such
notification,
there
was
filed
in
her
behalf
with
the
district
director
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
who
is
the
respondent
in
the
instant
proceeding,
an
application
for
a
stay
or
deportation
on
the
grounds
of
physical
persecution.
such
application
was
filed,
presumed
to
regulations
and
in
effect.
it
was
contended
in
that
petition
that
this
--
this
petitioner
would
suffer
physical
persecution,
probable
death
and
at
least
would
be
required
to
adhere
to
predispose
to
which
she
did
not
believe.
the
immigration
service
refused
to
accept
such
application,
stating
that
she
was
not
a
person
eligible
for
that
relief,
that
merely
following
notification
of
that
decision,
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
san
francisco.
the
court,
in
its
decision,
reached
a
conclusion
that
the
pleadings
did
not
state
facts
sufficient
to
warrant
the
issue
--
issuance
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
circuit
court
of
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
it.
and
i
might
state
that
at
no
time
was
the
petitioner
ever
given
a
hearing.
that
no
time
was
an
order
to
show
cause
ever
issued
by
the
district
court.
no
hearing
was
ever
held.
therefore,
the
only
thing
which
we
have
before
this
court
are
the
pleadings
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
similar
question
was
presented
to
other
--
two
other
circuits.
the
second
circuit
held
similar
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
persons
excluded
from
admission
to
the
united
states
were
not
persons
within
the
united
states,
within
the
statutory
language
of
section
243
(h)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
the
word
i
used.
that
is
the
word
in
phraseology
used
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
it
is
a
release
from
detention.
at
the
time
of
arrival
detention
facilities
were
available
in
the
appraisers
building
located
in
the
city.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
for
15
months.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
after
15
months
of
detention,
she
was
released
from
custody
upon
filing
a
bond.
she
was
permitted
to
come
physically
into
the
united
states,
remain
in
the
united
states
and
subsequently
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
at
that
time,
there
was
no
statutory
language
providing
it
for
the
parole
of
such
aliens.
since
that
time,
after
enactment
of
the
act
of
1952
which
became
effective
in
december
1952,
there
was
statutory
provisions
provided.
however,
the
release
in
this
case
occurred
prior
to
the
1952
act.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
they
did
it
in
a
number
of
other
cases.
a
similar
case
was
the
one
which
i
have
previously
before
this
court
which
was
reversed
in
the
suggestion
of
mootness,
the
case
of
choosing
who
have
lived
in
this
country
for
many
years.
he
was
an
armory
discharged
veteran
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
and
who
was
under
likewise
had
been
ordered
to
surrender
for
deportation.
a
similar
situation,
it
where
--
where
there
has
been
lengthy
detention
and
in
a
case
of
a
young
girl
such
as
this,
they
assumed
the
authority
to
release
from
detention.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
normally,
your
honor,
they
do
not
release
them.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that's
right.
the
interest
of
justice
in
fairness
and
that
is
what
occurred
in
this
case.
now,
the
court
has
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
this
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
section
212
(d)
(5)
of
the
new
immigration
act
of
1952.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
your
honor.
however,
the
bond
was
--
the
bond
agreement
which
she
signed
required
her
to
appear
at
anytime
when
called
upon
was
a
sufficient
notice
by
officers
of
the
immigration
service.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
it
was
not.
there
was
no
restriction
placed
at
all
(voice
overlap).
she
did
stayed
right
in
san
francisco.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
there
wasn't
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct
on
written
notice.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
normally,
the
chief
phraseology,
"release
on
bond"
applies
in
the
warrant
of
arrest
case.
the
--
a
parole
case
is
normally
one
which
is
not
--
there's
no
bond
exactly.
however,
it's
been
a
customary
practice
in
san
francisco
for
a
number
of
years
to
always
exact
the
bond
where
a
chinese
person
is
involved.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
it
varies,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
$500.
in
other
cases,
it
goes
as
high
as
$2000.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reached
a
contrary
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
this
type
of
person
is
a
person
within
the
united
states
and
entitled
to
a
relief
sought.
the
court
held
that
she
was
entitled
to
--
that
--
that
man
was
--
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
there
never
was
any
hearing.
they
held
that
she
was
not
eligible
and
refused
to
accept
the
application.
there
were
never
was
any
hearing.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
i
would
be
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
i
would
stay
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
i
was
going
to
come
to
that,
your
honor.
there's
a
difference
of
positions
between
counsel
in
the
following
case
and
myself
without
--
with
that
regard.
i
think
that
there
are
four
points
in
this
case.
one
is
the
human
rights,
whether
any
humanitarian
consideration
will
be
given
to
deportation
of
any
alien
to
a
communist
dominated
country
where
they
--
they
are
likely
to
suffer
physical
persecution.
the
other
three
points
are
all
one
of
statutory
construction
of
the
provisions
of
the
act.
there
are
three
questions
involved
in
the
statutory
construction
problem.
the
first
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
deportation?
secondly,
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
“any
alien”
as
used
in
section
243
(h),
the
section
under
which
the
application
was
filed.
the
third
question
is
what
is
the
meaning
of,
“within
the
united
states,”
as
used
in
the
same
section
of
law?
i
only
passed
over
lightly
the
first
one
because
i
think
we
can
reach
a
decision
--
the
court
can
reach
a
decision
on
the
statutory
construction
angle.
however,
i
believe
that
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated,
“if
a
person
were
detained
and
they
were
to
be
deported
to
a
communist
country
and
all
of
the
evidence
and
it
could
be
clearly
established
that
they
would
suffer
physical
persecution
and
probable
death.”
i
don't
think
the
courts
were
--
are
without
power
to
interfere
to
the
administrative
discretion.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
she
would
--
there's
no
question
about
where
she
was
to
be
returned.
it
was
admitted
and
it's
submitted
in
the
pleadings
that
she
was
to
be
returned
to
communist
china.
she
was
to
be
taken
by
boat
to
hong
kong.
she
had
a
transit
--
they
had
obtained
a
transit
visa
through
hong
kong.
she
was
to
be
placed
on
the
train,
taken
up
to
the
border
and
physically
put
over
the
border
in
the
communist
china.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
they
have
issued
a
transit
visa
and
a
transit
visa
only.
i
am
going
to
come
to
that
particular
question
afterwards
because
i
think
it
is
one
involved
in
the
statutory
construction,
because
this
petitioner
came
from
hong
kong.
it
is
true
that
she
is
a
native
and
citizen
of
china,
but
she
came
to
the
united
states
from
hong
kong
and
the
excluding
provisions,
the
law
relating
to
exclusion
says
that
they
shall
be
immediately
deported
back
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came.
that
is
not
what
they
--
is
occurring
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
a
contention
of
the
government
that
she
is
deportable
from
the
united
states
as
an
excluded
and
deportable
alien.
now,
the
section
relating
to
that
particular
section,
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
she
arrived
was
section
18
of
the
act
of
1917.
that
act
itself
said
they
shall
be
immediately
deported
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ng
weng
cheong
case
that
was
at
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
where
there
was
no
immediate
deportation,
that
the
person
have
to
be
deported
under
section
20
of
the
same
act.
that
is
the
act
of
1917.
now,
the
act
of
that
act
provided
that
they
could
not
only
be
deported
from
the
place
from
whence
they
came,
but
to
the
place
of
the
nationality,
to
a
country
in
close
proximity
thereto
or
to
any
other
country
of
a
choice
if
that
country
would
accept
him.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
to
whence
they
came.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
i
would
say
that
if
she
came
through
and
was
in
transit
to
in
hong
kong,
there
would
be
no
doubt
she
was
coming
from
china,
but
that
is
not
true
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
not
in
this
particular
case.
those
facts
--
those
are
facts
which
we
could
definitely
prove
at
the
time
that
the
hearing
were
granted
in
the
lower
court.
this
person
lived
in
hong
kong
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
prior
to
obtaining
documentation
from
the
american
consulate
in
hong
kong.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes.
i
--
that's
only
on
the
immigration
service
decision
because
that
same
section
provides
that
the
carrier
shall
take
the
individual
back
to
the
same
port
and
that
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
for
the
expenses.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
one
of
the
things
which
is
causing
confusion
in
the
instant
case
is
the
fact
that
we
had
two
sections
of
law
and
the
fact
that
the
time
of
arrival
of
this
applicant
in
1951,
at
the
time
of
the
conclusion
of
the
final
decision
of
the
administrative
agency,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
in
1952
had
been
passed.
there
are
two
similar
sections
contained
in
the
new
act,
section
237
and
section
243.
however,
in
section
243,
that
is
the
one
relating
to
certain
types
of
classes
of
aliens
and
it
is
the
contention
of
counsel
for
the
respondent.
at
section
237,
the
one
relating
to
exclusion
and
deportation
of
aliens
is
the
one
which
is
applicable
in
the
instant
case.
now,
section
237
states
in
itself.
it
refers
to
a
person
who
has
been
excluded
under
this
act.
by
this
act,
they're
referring
to
the
act
of
1952.
this
girl
was
not
excluded
under
the
1952
act.
she
was
excluded
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
the
--
of
1917.
we
also
have
and
giving
consideration
to
that
argument,
the
savings
clause
which
this
court
has
previously
construed
as
being
very
broad
and
it
preserves
any
rights,
status,
conditions
or
anything
in
the
process
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
the
new
legislation.
now,
section
243
states
that
a
person
shall
be
deported
whether
pursuant
to
this
act
or
any
other
act
or
treaty.
now,
since
section
237
refers
to
only
deportation
under
this
act,
that
is
the
1952
act,
she
is
not
deportable
from
united
states
under
that
section.
she
is
deportable
under
section
243
(h),
the
section
that
provides
for
the
deportation
of
persons
under
the
1952
act
or
any
other
act
or
treaty.
it
is
very
important
because
we
are
seeking
here
relief
under
section
243
(h),
yet,
the
immigration
service
and
the
courts
below
contend
that
she
is
not
an
alien
eligible
for
that
relief.
they
are
holding
that
even
though
she
maybe
deportable
from
the
united
states
under
section
243
(a),
she
is
not
entitled
to
relief
under
a
subsection
of
the
same
section
of
law.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
it
is
not.
not
an
exclusion
case.
it's
not
a
document.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
it
already
said
that
she
had
failed
to
reasonably
establish,
to
claim
relationship
to
united
states
citizens.
she
should
be
deported
from
united
states
in
the
manner
provided
by
law.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
the
only
--
only
indication
and
the
only
notification
we
received
is
a
notice
on
a
form
letter
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
your
honor.
it
is
one
which
was
adopted
subsequent
to
the
institution
of
the
--
this
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
it
was
filed
after
this
proceeding
has
started.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
not
--
not
at
the
time
that
this
proceeding
was
filed.
no.
after
that
time,
because
there
was
objection
to
counsel
to
the
practice
of
failing
to
notify
not
only
aliens,
but
counsel
where
the
person
was
to
be
deported.
they
have
adopted
a
new
practice
and
may
now
issue
a
written
notification
stating
the
place
to
whence
a
person
is
to
be
deported.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
thing
that
the
court
has
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
your
honor,
you
--
all
you
have
before
the
court
is
the
pleadings.
the
pleadings
were
not
denied
and
in
the
pleadings,
it
is
stated
that
i
as
counsel
was
notified
by
the
official
officer
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
of
san
franscisco
that
this
alien
was
to
be
deported
to
communist
china.
that
has
never
been
denied
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
denial
on
the
part
of
the
government
at
this
time.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
however,
they
have
made
arrangements
as
it
states.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
district
director?
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
i
would
state
that
if
arrangements
have
been
made
for
her
admission
to
hong
kong,
we
would
have
no
right
to
be
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
cases
where
persons
have
been
returned
to
hong
kong.
and
in
those
cases,
no
action
of
this
nature
has
been
filed.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct.
i
agree.
in
this
particular
case,
the
decision
below
rest
upon
interpretation
of
the
phrase
within
the
united
states
as
it
is
contained
in
section
243
(h)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
stated
that
this
alien
is
not
a
person
within
the
united
states
as
contemplated
in
a
congressional
legislation.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
--
i
might
be
here
for
statutory
construction,
your
honor,
of
the
section.
however,
a
person
who
is
going
to
return
to
a
country
such
as
hong
kong
certainly
could
not
contend
that
they
would
be
subject
to
physical
persecution
and
file
an
application
for
the
relief
as
provided
by
that
section
of
law.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
my
contention.
that
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
i
am
not
contending
that
this
person
should
be
admitted
to
the
united
states
law
free
for
permanent
residence
nor
that
she
is
entitled
to
admission
for
permanent
residence.
however,
it
is
my
contention
that
she's
entitled
to
a
stay
of
deportation
or
a
continuation
abroad.
i
don't
care
which
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that's
--
no,
until
such
time
these
arrangements
can
be
made
to
deport
her
to
a
country
where
she
would
not
suffer
physical
persecution.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no
matter
what
her
status
is.
they
cannot
send
her
to
china
because
that's
not
the
place
from
whence
she
came.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
except,
your
honor,
that
section
243
if
--
if
you
hold
section
243
of
the
new
act
is
the
applicable
deportation
statute
then
they
can
deport
her
to
china,
because
that
section
provides
that
they
cannot
--
they
can
be
deported
not
only
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came,
but
to
the
country
of
their
citizenship
and
nationality
to
any
country
in
close
proximity
thereto
or
to
any
other
country
that
they
may
choose.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
the
government
was
paying
for
it
in
this
particular
case.
now,
getting
to
the
phrase
within
the
united
states,
i
would
like
to
cover
that
before
my
time
expires.
a
lot
of
the
argument
will
be
covered
by
counsel
representing
the
following
case.
however,
i
would
like
to
comment
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
feel
that
within
the
united
states
applies
in
the
instant
case.
now,
relating
to
section
262
of
the
same
act.
it
states
that
any
alien
in
the
united
states
must
comply
with
the
alien
registration
provisions
and
it
uses
the
word
“in”.
in
section
265
of
the
same
act,
it
provides
that
any
alien
within
the
united
states
must
file
an
alien
address
report
card
in
the
month
of
january
of
each
year.
now,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
admit
that
a
person
paroled
in
the
united
states
is
a
person
required
to
comply
with
the
alien
registration
provision
and
is
a
person
required
to
file
an
alien
address
report
card
in
the
month
of
january
of
each
year.
in
addition,
when
congress
passed
this
enactment
in
300
--
section
360,
it
provided
that
a
person,
any
alien
in
the
united
states
who've
made
a
claim
of
united
states
citizenship
could
file
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
where
they
claimed
permanent
residence,
except
an
alien
excluded
from
united
states.
now,
they
said,
“any
alien
within
the
united
states,
except
an
excluded
alien.”
now,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
put
the
phraseology
except
and
exclude
alien
into
that
piece
of
legislation,
unless
an
excluded
alien
was
an
individual
who
was
within
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
of
course,
sir.
i
disagree
with
--
i
disagree
with
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
it
has
had
many
constructions,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
has
have
been.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
for
a
long
period
of
time.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
if
i
might
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
there
is
one
comment
i
would
like
to
make
in
the
argument
by
counsel
for
the
respondent.
he
refers
to
exclusion
and
deportation
as
if
they
were
two
separate
and
distinct
things.
they
are
not.
exclusion
and
deportation
is
a
phraseology
used
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
and
has
been
used
for
many
years.
it
refers
to
a
type
of
deportation.
the
other
type
which
is
referred
to
is
expulsion
and
deportation.
however,
whether
it
is
exclusion
or
whether
it
is
expulsion,
they
both
result
in
deportation,
which
is
the
physical
removal
of
a
person
from
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
there
is
a
difference.
one
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
as
far
as
--
he
said
one
is
deportation
and
one
is
exclusion.
i
hold
that
they
both
are
deportation.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
now,
under
--
under
one
of
the
answering
--
one
of
the
questions
of
mr.
chief
justice
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
a
person
who
had
sneaked
in
the
united
states
would
be
eligible
to
fall
in
this
section.
the
answer
would
have
to
be
answered
affirmative
even
though
he
had
been
in
the
united
states
for
only
one
day.
it
would
not
necessarily
have
to
be
in
the
united
states
for
the
period
of
time
which
this
girl
was
here
in
--
on
parole.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
but
it's
--
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
one
point
which
i
want
to
refer
to
once
again
is
the
fact
that
construing
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
--
as
a
whole,
the
1952
section.
the
word
“in”
and
“within”
is
used
constantly
throughout
the
legislation.
and
in
every
case,
it
refers
to
the
fact
of
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
and
a
person
on
parole
is
construed
as
being
a
person
who
must
comply
with
other
provisions
of
the
same
piece
of
legislation.
the
only
other
comment
i
would
like
to
make
is
this.
the
immigration
service
in
ordering
this
alien
deported
to
communist
china
must
have
been
directing
deportation
under
section
243
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
if
such
be
the
case,
then
certainly
she
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
a
subsection
of
the
same
section
of
law.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
well,
i
think
the
first
answer
in
the
first
problem,
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
212
(d)
(5)
and
243
(h),
i
would
answer
that
in
the
affirmative.
there
is,
with
regard
to
the
application
which
was
submitted
for
relief
under
212
(d)
(5)
when
this
case
was
taken
off
the
counter
to
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general.
there
was
just
a
written
application
submitted
to
the
district
director
in
accordance
with
his
regulations
for
relief
under
that
provision.
no
evidence
was
submitted.
no
hearing
was
conducted.
recently,
the
immigration
service
has
determined
that
in
a
case
filed
under
section
243
that
the
person
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer,
at
which
time
they
are
orally
examined
and
an
opportunity
to
support
it
for
the
introduction
of
evidence
and
we
have
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
regional
commissioner.
and
in
those
cases,
of
course,
we
rely
upon
many
other
things
which
are
referred
to
in
the
petitioner's
opening
brief,
concerning
the
korean
situation,
the
fact
the
congress
saw
fit
to
enact
legislation
for
displaced
persons,
for
refugees
and
prior
decisions
of
the
immigration
service
that
people
similarly
situated
would
suffer
physical
persecution.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
under
2
(d)
--
212
(d)
(5),
you
have
no
hearing.
mr.
joseph
s.
hertogs
no,
your
honor.
