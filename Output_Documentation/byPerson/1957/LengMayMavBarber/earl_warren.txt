with

mr.

chief
justice
earl

mr.
hertogs
is
there
no
distinction
at
all
between
parole
as
that
term
is
used
in
this
another
cases
and
on
the
other
hand,
release
on
bond?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
in
what
amount
--
what
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
country
would
this
--
would
this
petitioner
be
returned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
the
hong
kong
--
doesn't
the
hong
kong
authorities
have
a
say
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sand,
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
--
if
this
court
should
decide
the
case
in
favor
of
petitioner
that
that
would
adversely
affect
the
immigration
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
sand,
suppose
that
this
young
woman,
instead
of
coming
into
the
country
by
parole
had
sneaked
across
the
border
and
had
been
in
this
country
for
the
same
length
of
time
and
the
attorney
general
wanted
to
send
her
back,
the
country
she
came
from,
say
it
was
the
same
country,
would
he
have
jurisdiction
under
243
(h)
there
to
--
to
consider
her
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
then
--
why
then
wouldn't
he
have
it
--
would
he
have
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
she
wouldn't
be
legally
within
the
united
states
as
she
sneaked
towards
the
border
(voice
overlap)
would
she?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
based
your
--
your
argument
on
the
fiction
as
to
whether
this
--
this
young
woman
is
actually
within
the
united
states
now
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
referring
back
to
your
--
to
your
fiction,
don't
you
believe
that
the
--
that
the
fiction
as
to
whether
one
who
sneaks
into
the
country
is
--
is
in
the
country
and
one
who
is
here
under
parole
is
not
within
the
country,
becomes
a
distinction
without
a
difference
when
the
government
permits
the
person
to
come
into
the
country
and
permits
the
person
to
remain
here
for
a
period
of
time
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
--
for
any
purpose,
whether
it's
for
the
purpose
of
--
well,
for
any
purpose.
and
she
remains
here
for
--
for
a
period
of
years,
so
far
as
the
fiction
of
whether
she
is
in
the
united
states
or
not.
and
whether
that
fiction
should
keep
should
keep
her
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
country,
put
her
out
of
the
country
regardless
of
what
persecution
she
might
meet
when
she
goes
home,
disappears.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
can
you
say
that
there's
such
a
great
danger
of
the
change
of
status
when
all
she
ask
for
is
to
have
the
same
kind
of
consideration
under
section
243
(h)
that
you
say
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
give
her
under
the
other
sections?
now,
what
grave
consequence
is
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
is
a
person
--
here's
a
person
who
is
in
one
of
those
detention
centers
under
parole?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
that's
not
requested
in
these
cases.
they're
just
asking
as
to
those
who
are
on
parole.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
do
propose
to
return
this
young
woman
to
china.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
what
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
propose
--
you
do
propose
to
send
her
back
to
china,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
39
--
oh
you
have
--
i
think
you
had
a
few
moments
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
may
have
two
or
three
minutes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
wish
to
--
to
conclude.
