mr.
leonard
b.
sand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
state
at
the
outset
that
the
issue
which
is
now
before
this
court,
which
wholly
want
a
statutory
construction
is
whether
the
attorney
general
has
any
power
to
act
under
a
certain
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationalization
act
of
1952,
which
speaks
of
withholding
deportation
of
any
alien
within
the
united
states.
the
question
is
whether
he
has
any
power
to
act
under
that
particular
section
of
the
statute.
there
is
presented
in
this
case
no
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
orders
excluding
these
aliens
from
the
united
states.
some
reference
is
made
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
hearing
in
this
case
and
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
counsel
for
petitioner
there
refers
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
hearing
held
on
the
application
under
243
(h),
because
the
attorney
general
took
the
view
that
he
had
no
power
to
act
under
that
statute.
there
was
of
course
a
hearing
on
the
earlier
question
of
excludability
of
this
alien
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
orders
which
have
excluded
the
alien
in
this
case
and
in
the
succeeding
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
i'm
saying
--
i'm
saying
almost
that.
i'm
saying
that
the
attorney
general
has
said,
that
with
respect
to
an
alien
who
has
been
excluded
from
the
united
states
albeit
released
on
parole,
there
is
no
power
to
act
under
this
particular
section
of
the
statute.
now,
the
court
will
recall
that
on
the
motion
of
the
solicitor
general,
this
case
was
held
in
advance,
because
the
solicitor
general
was
of
the
view
that
there
was
power
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
under
which
the
attorney
general
might
grant
parole,
might
continue
parole,
might
continue
the
physical
presence
of
the
alien
in
this
country.
and
that
in
considering
whether
to
exercise
the
discretion
given
in
that
other
section
of
the
statute,
which
is
212
(d)
(5)
and
which
appears
at
page
3
of
the
government's
brief,
a
relevant
consideration
would
be
whether
the
alien
would
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
in
other
words,
the
question
now
before
this
court,
is
not
whether
congress
has
anywhere
given
the
attorney
general
power
to
act
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
physical
persecution
by
an
excluded
alien,
but
whether
he
has
given
--
whether
congress
has
given
the
attorney
general
power
to
so
act
under
section
243
(h).
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
could
and
in
fact
what
has
--
what
has
occurred
is
that
while
the
case
was
pending
in
this
court,
applications
were
made
for
relief
by
petitioner
in
this
case
and
respondents
in
the
succeeding
case
for
relief
under
to
212
(d)
(5).
those
applications
have
been
denied
by
the
attorney
general,
acting
through
his
delegate
in
the
immigration
service
on
the
grounds
among
others
that
the
petitioner
failed
to
establish
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
service
that
she'd
be
subject
to
physical
persecution
in
the
country
to
which
she
was
being
sent.
now,
the
action
under
212
(d)
(5)
is
not
now
before
this
court
and
i
make
reference
to
it,
simply
to
emphasize
again
that
the
question
is
not
whether
there
is
any
power
in
the
attorney
general
to
act
with
respect
to
such
a
claim
on
the
part
of
an
excluded
alien.
the
question
is
whether
that
power
is
contained
in
212
(d)
(5).
we
agree
that
it
is,
whether
it
is
also
contained
in
243
(h).
the
attorney
general
has
taken
the
view
that
it
does
not
--
that
the
explicit
phrase
“deportation
of
any
alien
within
the
united
states,”
indicates
that
that
provision
has
reference
only
to
aliens
who
in
legal
contemplation,
as
well
as
in
fact
all
within
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
is
the
basis
for
the
--
for
the
distinction
with
respect
to
this
relief,
because
212
(d)
(5)
talks
of
parole
into
the
united
states
and
talks
of
applicants
for
admission
to
the
united
states.
so
clearly,
the
relief
within
in
that
section
maybe
accorded
to
--
to
one
who
is
at
the
gates,
whereas
243
(h)
which
talks
of
any
alien
within
the
united
states
has
reference.
the
government
submits
to
aliens
who
are
legally
within
the
united
states
who
were
subject
to
deportation
rather
than
exclusion.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
was
rejected
because
among
other
reasons.
the
petitioner
failed
to
establish
in
the
view
of
the
service
that
she
will
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
when
you
say
allowable
finding
of
fact,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
this
was
a
--
it's
the
same
reason
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
under
--
i
think
there
would
--
there's
still
a
case
before
this
court,
because
under
--
under
--
the
practice
has
been
under
243
(h)
to
accord
the
--
the
alien
a
--
a
hearing
and
for
findings
to
be
made
under
243
(h).
under
212
(d)
(5),
there
was
no
--
the
alien
is
permitted
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
no,
the
--
the
alien
was
--
was
afforded
an
opportunity
to
submit
whatever
material
it
saw
fit
and
then
there
was
the
rejection
of
the
claim
by
the
--
by
the
director
of
immigration
in
the
letter
to
the
alien
which
set
--
set
forth
the
fact
that
because
for
other
reasons
--
because
among
other
reasons,
petitioner
has
failed
to
establish
in
the
view
of
a
service
that
she
will
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
the
standards
are
not
identical
under
the
two
sections,
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
because
among
other
reasons.
you
see,
under
--
under
243
(h),
the
only
question
is
whether
the
alien
would
be
subject
to
physical
persecution.
the
language
which
is
set
forth
in
212
(d)
(5)
provides
a
different
standard.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
--
that
was
the
language
which
we
are
told
by
the
service
and
--
and
the
petitioner
was
told
with
the
grounds
for
the
rejection
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
under
212
(d)
(5).
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
not
necessarily,
because
there
are
other
factors
which
may
--
may
also
be
considering.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
there
are
also
maybe
differences,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
which
--
to
which
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
what
comes
down
to
is
this,
that
if
--
if
it
is
found
that
there
is
power,
if
this
court
should
hold
that
there
is
power
under
243
(h)
for
the
attorney
general
to
act,
it
may
very
well
be
that
--
that
the
end
result
with
be
the
same.
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
is
it
--
yes.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
--
that
--
i
think
that
what
petitioner
in
this
case
is
basically
attacking
is
the
concept
of
parole.
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
the
only
court
which
is
held
at
243
(h)
is
applicable
here,
which
is
the
district
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
held
that
the
alien
was
within
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
the
parole.
now,
as
--
as
counsel
for
petitioner
stated
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
concept
of
parole
is
--
is
a
longstanding
one,
which
long
antedates
this
statute
and
that
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
such
cases,
this
kaplan
against
tod
in
1925.
that
parole
did
not
bring
the
alien
within
the
united
states
in
--
in
contemplation
of
law,
so
that
--
so
that
what
this
case
comes
down
to
is
whether
the
fact
that
the
alien
has
been
granted
parole,
will
change
her
immigration
status,
so
as
to
bring
her
within
a
different
area
of
operation
of
the
immigration
statutes.
and
that
is
a
concept
which
we
submit
is
hostile
to
the
basic
notion
of
parole
and
which
will
in
the
long
run,
not
only
operate
to
the
judgment
of
the
service,
but
--
but
to
the
detriment
of
the
alien
as
well.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
think,
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
argument
which
is
advanced
on
behalf
of
the
aliens
in
this
case
is
that
--
is
hostile,
as
i've
stated,
to
this
--
to
the
concept
of
parole,
because
it
would
seek
to
attach
to
parole
the
consequences
of
changing
the
immigration
status.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
--
certainly,
it
would
have
to
be
a
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
parole
an
alien,
what
consequences
that
would
have
on
the
status
of
the
alien
and
--
and
the
whole
--
we
--
we're
dealing
here
with
the
legal
fiction,
the
legal
fiction
being
that
an
excluded
alien
paroled
in
the
united
states
is
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
within
the
united
states.
now,
i
don't
think
legal
fiction
is
a
term
of
disparagement.
it
indicates,
this
is
a
concept
which
was
invoked
to
serve
a
purpose
and
in
determining
whether
or
not,
one
looks
to
the
physical
fact
that
the
alien
is
physically
in
the
country,
or
to
the
legal
fact.
one
has
to
refer
back
to
this
purpose
for
which
this
legal
fiction
was
created.
and
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
history
of
the
immigration
statutes
and
from
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
such,
as
kaplan
against
tod
that
the
purpose
was
to
permit
the
alien
to
enjoy
the
greater
liberty
and
freedom
which
parole
offers
without
altering
the
immigration
status.
and
that
is
the
concept
which
congress
explicitly
recognized
in
the
immigration
act
of
1952.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
nishimura
ekiu
against
united
states
in
1892
held
that
an
alien
in
the
detention
center
was
not
legally
within
the
united
states.
and
then
--
then,
as
mr.
justice
holmes
said
in
kaplan
against
tod,
the
prison
bounds
were
expanded.
the
alien
was
permitted
to
--
to
enjoy
parole,
but
legally,
she
was
regarded
as
still
being
on
the
vessel
which
brought
her
to
the
--
to
the
united
states.
and
this
was
a
concept,
which
was
to
the
benefit
of
the
alien.
this
is
the
concept,
which
permitted
the
alien
not
to
be
forced
to
remain
physically
on
the
vessel,
not
to
be
forced
to
be
--
to
remain
in
the
detention
center.
since
november
1954,
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
attorney
general,
through
the
immigration
service
to
grant
parole
as
to
all
aliens,
except
those
thought
likely
to
abscond
and
--
and
security
risks.
and
as
the
court
--
the
court
may
judicially
note,
the
large
detention
centers
have
been
closed.
this
is
a
policy
which
we
think
is
a
--
a
beneficial
one,
a
humanitarian
one.
and
we
shrink
from
any
construction
of
the
immigration
laws,
the
consequence
of
which
is
going
to
be
to
require
a
--
a
change
in
the
immigration
status
of
the
alien
by
virtue
of
parole,
because
the
whole
concept
of
parole
is
that
the
status
quo
of
the
alien
remains
unchanged.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
he
--
he
would,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
--
because
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
because
it's
basic
to
the
government's
argument
that
there
has
always
been
in
the
immigration
laws
of
this
country,
a
distinction
between
the
excluded
alien
and
the
alien
who
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
in
the
united
states.
this
is
a
distinction
which
--
which
is
reflected
as
i
say
in
--
in
the
earliest
--
in
the
earliest
cases
and
in
every
case
in
which
that
distinction
has
been
made
and
there
are
several
that
can
be
said,
“oh,
if
---
if
the
alien
had
not
been
stopped
at
the
port,
but
had
sneaked
to
cross
the
border,”
then
it
would
be
different.
yes,
it
would
be
different
because
then
--
then,
there
was
never
available
to
the
--
to
the
government
the
--
the
power
to
--
to
keep
the
alien
at
the
border.
what's
involved
here
is
the
question
whether
where
the
government
has
the
power
physically
as
well
as
legally
to
exclude
the
alien
from
the
country,
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
alien
permits
her
to
come
in
on
parole.
she
is
then
to
be
regarded
as
legally
within
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
she
would
be
--
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
she
would
be
within
the
united
states
though
--
the
fact
that
she
was
in
the
united
states
would
be
--
would
be
legally
cognizable.
we
would
not
engage
in
this
--
in
this
concept
that
the
excluded
alien,
though
paroled,
is
not
legally
within
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
a
concept
which
as
i
have
said
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
base
my
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
fact
that
reading
the
immigration
act
of
1952,
the
government
finds
in
it
over
and
over
again
instances
that
congress
has
adhered
in
this
statute
as
it
has
in
old
prior
statutes,
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
difference
between
an
excluded
alien,
who
is
subject
to
exclusion
and
--
and
an
alien
who
is
within
the
united
states
and
in
subject
to
deportation.
and
that
this
particular
statute,
243
(h),
deals
only
with
aliens
who
are
subject
to
deportation.
one
finds
that
in
the
immigration
act
of
1952,
that
there
are
separate
provisions,
separate
chapters
which
deal
with
exclusion
and
those
which
deal
with
deportation.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
that
when
we're
dealing
with
this
fiction
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
is
not
term
of
disparagement.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
will.
well,
i
thought
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
want
to
associate
my
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
--
i
want
to
join
in
--
in
associating
myself
from
--
from
any
notion
that's
a
term
of
disparagement.
this
is
a
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
i
think
it's
in
a
humanitarian
term.
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
the
only
device,
the
only
method
by
which
it
is
possible
for
the
united
states
which
must
of
course
maintain
control
over
who
will
and
who
will
not
come
to
this
country.
it
is
the
only
device
by
which
the
united
states
can
permit
a
--
a
screening
of
these
aliens,
a
determination
of
which
aliens
are
admissible
and
which
will
be
excluded.
the
only
way
that
that
can
be
done
without
requiring
the
aliens
physically
to
be
kept
aboard
the
ship
or
--
or
in
--
in
the
detention
center,
and
in
--
in
further
answering
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
whenever
you
have
to
determine,
the
government
submits,
whether
you
will
adhere
to
the
concept
that
an
excluded
alien,
though
paroled
is
not
within
the
united
states.
you
have
to
go
back
to
this
basic
concept
that
this
is
the
device
which
permits
the
alien
to
enjoy
this
greater
liberty
while
her
immigration
status
is
being
determined.
and
--
and
i
think
that
that
if
you
say,
“well
--
well,
she's
here.”
then,
you
--
then
you're
compelling
in
essence,
those
who
are
entrusted
with
the
administration
of
the
immigration
laws
to
say,
“well,
then,
we
can't
let
her
be
here.
we
must
keep
her
on
the
boat.
we
must
keep
her
in
the
detention
center.”
it's
anomalous.
it's
a
paradox
that
in
this
case,
the
argument
which
is
hostile
to
the
concept
of
parole,
but
be
--
hostile
to
that
concept
because
it
reasons
from
the
mere
fact
of
parole.
there
is
a
change
in
the
immigration
status
that
that
argument
is
advanced
here
on
behalf
of
the
alien.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
consequence
is,
mr.
justice
warren,
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
the
attorney
general
saw
fit
or
did
not
see
fit
to
act
under
243
(h).
this
is
a
question
of
whether
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
--
which
throughout
the
act,
recognize
the
difference
between
exclusion
and
--
and
deportation,
whether
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
given
the
attorney
general
any
power
to
act
under
this
statute.
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
very
illuminating,
because
prior
to
1952,
in
this
particular
statute,
there
were
not
the
words
within
the
united
states.
and
in
the
1952
immigration
act,
congress
specifically
inserted
in
this
provision
the
phrase
within
the
united
states.
now,
obviously,
congress
doesn't
legislate
extraterritorially.
there
is
no
provision.
there
is
no
occasion
or
purpose
for
congress
to
--
to
provide
the
deportation
of
--
of
an
alien
from
one
foreign
country
to
another.
and
so,
the
phrase
within
the
united
states
following
the
phrase
deportation
of
any
alien
is
completely
meaningless.
it's
--
it's
a
redundant
phrase
which
had
no
purpose
when
it
was
inserted,
unless,
it
has
reference,
unless,
it
has
reference
to
this
concept
that
an
alien
who
has
been
excluded
is
not
legally
within
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
three
courts
of
appeals
have
--
have
passed
upon
this
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
second
circuit
in
(inaudible)
which
is
now
pending
on
--
on
petition
of
certiorari
has
agreed
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
that
there
is
no
power
to
act
under
this
provision
of
the
statute.
the
district
of
--
of
columbia
in
the
case
which
the
court
will
next
hear
has
held
otherwise.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
is
the
only
conflict.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
mr.
justice
burton,
i
would
think
logically
that
that
would
follow
and
that
of
course
would
wipe
out
from
the
--
from
the
pages
of
this
court's
report,
the
countless
cases
which
you
held
than
an
alien
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
no
he
is
not.
so,
if
he
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
therefore,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
come
back
to
the
proposition
that
if
the
united
states
had
not
exercised
its
discretion
to
grant
parole
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
question
as
to
the
status
of
the
alien.
but
by
virtue
of
parole,
despite
the
fact
that
congress
explicitly
provided
that
parole
should
not
change
the
status
of
the
alien.
you
would
be
saying
that
--
that
the
immigration
status
was
changed.
i
suggest
and
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
such
a
contention
would,
in
the
long
run,
not
be
in
the
best
interest
of
--
of
the
--
of
aliens?
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
and
it
could
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
it
could
--
you're
correct
that
it
can
only
have
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
i
may
just
--
just
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that's
correct.
it
can
only
be
geographically
illegal
and
it
can't
be
geographical,
because
congress
--
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
no
power
to
provide
for
the
deportation
of
any
alien
who's
not
within
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
we
could
send
--
she
could
be
sent
back
to
hong
kong
of
course,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
only
if
the
authorities
in
the
hong
kong
would
permit
her
to
--
to
remain
in
hong
kong.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
she
arrived
from
the
mainland
of
china
via
hong
kong
and
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
the
record
does
not
indicate,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
length
of
her
residence
in
hong
kong.
but
had
she
been
in
hong
kong
long
enough
so
that
the
hong
kong
authorities
were
satisfied
that
she
had
established
permanent
residence
in
hong
kong.
then
–
then,
they
would
received
her
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
we
--
well,
in
fact,
the
sending
back
of
aliens
to
the
mainland
of
china
through
hong
kong
is
done
through
diplomatic
relations
which
we
have
with
the
authorities
in
hong
kong.
of
course
–-
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that
is
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
this
is
--
that's
right.
this
is
a
–
this
is
a
question
which
--
which
the
hong
kong,
the
--
the
country
from
whence
she
came
means
the
country
of
--
of
last
permanent
residence
and
if
–-
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
the
--
the
record
does
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
as
a
matter
of
--
there
is
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
--
the
united
states
has
--
is
--
is
powerless
to
tell
the
hong
kong
authorities
who
they
should
--
should
permit
to
remain
in
hong
kong
and
--
and
who
they
should
not
permit
to
remain
in
hong
kong.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
in
--
in
fact,
the
practice
had
been
to
obtain
transit
visas
through
hong
kong
and
for
the
--
the
aliens
who
arrived
from
the
mainland
of
china
and
who
went
through
hong
kong,
but
who
were
not
in
hong
kong
for
so
--
on
a
period
of
time,
that
the
hong
kong
authorities
will
--
will
permit
them
to
remain.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
we
propose
to
follow
the
procedure
which
is
set
forth
in
the
--in
an
affidavit
in
a
--
which
is
in
deportation
case
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondent's
brief
in
the
next
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
it
is
a
procedure
which
--
under
which
the
hong
kong
government
grants
a
transit
visa.
under
that
visa,
the
--
the
alien
is
taken
to
hong
kong
and
is
presented
at
the
--
at
the
border.
if
she
as
--
is
accepted
into
china
as
in
--
in
fact
has
always
occurred,
well
then
she
--
she
has
been
returned
to
china.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
if
she
–-
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
her
ultimate
destination
is
china.
that's
not
denied,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes.
well,
i
refer
to
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
it
appears
at
--
at
page
3
of
the
--
of
the
government's
--
the
brief
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
i
have
reference
to
the
last
clause
in
section
212
(d)
(5).
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
that's
right.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
status
quo,
what
--
whatever
condition
the
alien
was
in
at
the
time
she
was
paroled
is
the
condition
which
--
which
she
continuous
to
enjoy.
in
the
next
case,
i
will
deal
with
that
at
great
length.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
i
--
i
think
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
what
--
there
is
a
complaint
--
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleged
that
the
alien
was
being
sent
back
to
china.
the
government
did
not
controvert
that
allegation.
the
only
question
which
the
record
in
this
case
raises
is
whether
there
is
power
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
well,
that
would
--
that
would
depend
on
--
on
factual
questions.
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
but
those
--
mr.
leonard
b.
sand
yes,
not
in
the
record.
