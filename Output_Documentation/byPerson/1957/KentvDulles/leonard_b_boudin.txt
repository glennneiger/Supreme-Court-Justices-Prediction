mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
these
cases
which
are
suits
for
passports
by
american
citizens
against
the
secretary
of
state
arose
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
involved
the
following
issue,
whether
the
secretary
of
state
has
the
right
to
deny
passports
to
american
citizens
on
the
basis
of
political
standard
devised
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
issues
involved
are
both
statutory
and
constitutional.
so,
of
course,
we
address
ourselves
to
the
alleged
lack
of
authority
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
state
under
any
statutes
of
the
united
states.
the
facts
which
i
actually
referred
to
very
briefly
are
these.
dr.
walter
briehl
is
an
american
psychiatrist
who's
approximately
is
27
years.
he
served
as
a
lieutenant
colonel
in
united
states
army
in
charge
of
army
hospitals
at
the
psychiatric
parts
of
the
hospitals.
he
is
a
practicing
psychiatrist
in
los
angeles
and
is
connected
with
many
medical
societies,
psychoanalytic,
psychiatric
and
otherwise
which
i
specified
in
the
record.
as
a
member
of
the
society
as
a
delegate
of
these
medical
societies,
he
has
had
occasion
to
travel
abroad,
most
recently
in
1953
with
an
american
passport
for
the
purpose
of
attending
international
conventions
on
mental
health
and
on
psychoanalysis
and
reporting
back
to
his
medical
societies.
he
did
that
in
1953,
and
when
he
attempted
to
renew
his
passport
in
1955
for
the
same
purpose
acting
as
a
delegate
of
his
medical
societies,
he
received
instead
a
typical
letter
from
the
director
of
the
passport
office
in
which
it
was
said,
that
certain
allegations
had
been
made
against
dr.
briehl
by
persons
who
are
not
specified.
the
allegations
were
of
course
not
for
him,
but
we
know
that
he
had
at
one
time
unspecified
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
he
has
been
a
member
of
a
number
of
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
three
or
four
or
five,
or
associated
with
him
and
that
he
had
once
petitioned
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
not
to
prosecute
communists
under
the
smith
act.
and
so,
the
department
had
he
made
these
charges
against
dr.
briehl
said
to
him
in
his
letter,
“we
ask
you
now
for
an
affidavit
as
to
whether
you
have
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
ever,
whether
you
are
now,
and
we
ask
you
also
to
explain
under
oath
your
connections
with
the
communist-front
organizations
which
we
have
described
in
our
letter
and
any
other
communist-front
organizations?”
dr.
briehl
demanded
a
hearing,
a
quasi-judicial
hearing
in
view
of
a
recent
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
dulles
against
nathan,
and
instead
he
received
an
informal
hearing
in
the
passport
office
in
1955
and
which
he
was
the
only
witness.
no
witnesses
were
offered
by
the
government
in
support
of
any
of
the
allegations
and
instead,
the
passport
office
sought
to
examine
dr.
briehl
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
of
his
letter.
he
declined
to
answer
the
questions
with
respect
to
communist
party
membership,
communist-front
organizations
so-called
or
his
associations.
and
the
department
refused
to
issue
a
passport
to
him,
indeed,
refused
to
act
upon
his
passport
application
at
all.
now,
the
case
of
mr.
rockwell
kent
is
essentially
the
same.
mr.
kent
is
well-known
explorer,
writer
and
artist,
internationally
known
of
course,
known
--
i
assume
to
the
members
of
this
court.
he
has
traveled
abroad
very
widely
for
more
than
50
years
using
passports.
well,
passports
were
required
as
they
have
more
recently
and
i
assume
traveling
without
passports
in
the
earlier
years
when
they
were
not
required.
and
the
great
created
work
manifested
in
his
writings
and
in
his
art
has
been
the
product
of
this
international
travel.
mr.
kent
applied
in
1955
for
a
passport
to
travel
abroad
where
as
he
said
under
oath,
"pleasure
and
profession."
and
i
assume
that
the
tour
intermingled
with
him,
and
he
received
a
similar
letter
from
the
director
of
the
passport
office
stating,
“you
mr.
kent
are
alleged
who
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
time,
place
unspecified.
you
mr.
kent
had
been
connected
with
many
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list
and
you
have
done
many
other
things,
some
of
which
we
will
now
specify.
and
your
honors
will
see
and
i
think
the
outrage
of
the
kinds
of
things
alleged
on
page
8
of
my
brief,
alleged
against
an
american
citizen
as
mentioned
as
a
reason
for
denying
him
liberty
of
movement.
for
example,
it
has
been
alleged
if
you
sought
to
repeal
in
the
walter-mccarran
law.
it
has
been
alleged
that
you
urge
clemency
for
rosenberg,
so
it
is.
you
urge
to
release
on
bail
of
steve
nelson
who
was
convicted
of
sedition
in
pennsylvania,
he
was
sponsor
of
a
petition
addressed
to
attorney
general
brownell
criticizing
the
use
of
paid
informants.
i
surely,
do
not
have
to
rely
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
upholding
the
positions
taken
by
mr.
kent
on
many
of
these
issues.
the
fact
is
that
mr.
kent
had
a
constitutional
right
to
take
all
of
these
positions
and
at
the
same
time
to
have
the
liberty
of
movement
which
is
demanded.
now,
both
mr.
kent
--
mr.
kent
also,
i
may
say,
was
given
the
same
kind
of
informal
hearing,
only
with
two
variations.
his
autobiography
called
“it's
me,
o
lord”
which
he
tells
the
entire
philosophy
of
life
as
candidly
as
anyone
could,
was
introduced
in
the
evidence
by
the
passport
office.
his
book
was
put
in
there
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
mr.
kent
had
admitted
that
he
had
been
connected
with
the
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
and
also,
the
passport
office
introduced
testimony
given
by
mr.
kent
before
the
mccarthy
committee
in
1953
because
the
department
considered
it
significant
that
he
had
asserted
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
both
plaintiffs
started
these
lawsuits
which
were
dismissed
in
the
district
court
under
the
secretary
regulations
and
the
dismissal
was
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
should
of
course
give
your
honors
first
the
regulations
because
they
are
--
before
i
give
your
honors
the
regulations,
may
i
state
two
concessions
made
by
the
government
which
has
never
been
made
in
the
course
of
these
two
years
of
litigation
or
indeed
in
the
five
years
in
which
we
have
been
litigating
many
other
passport
cases
in
the
district.
for
the
first
time,
we
learned
in
this
court
and
into
the
credit
of
the
government
that
there
is
a
constitutional
liberty
of
movement.
they
make
that
concession.
they
seek
to
undercut
it
but
we'll
discuss
that
later.
secondly,
they,
for
the
first
time
disavow
the
claim
of
inherent
power
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
control
the
movement
of
citizens
abroad,
a
claim
of
inherent
power
that
was
made
up
to
this
court's
level.
therefore,
we
come
down
to
the
preliminary
questions.
where
is
the
statute
that
authorizes
the
secretary
of
state,
prevent
american
citizens
from
going
abroad
for
profession,
pleasure,
vagrancy
or
any
other
reasons?
now,
we
turn
to
the
regulations
again.
the
regulations
holds
vagueness
and
i
must
say,
outrageous
character
is
apparent
from
their
reading
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
shall
hold
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
very
well,
i
shall
hold
--
withhold
to
turn,
your
honor.
i
shall
let
your
honor's
judgment
determine
that
after
reading
the
regulations.
the
regulations
provide
in
section
51.135
at
page
66
the
following.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
56,
thank
you,
your
honor,
of
my
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
there
are
three
categories
of
citizens
who
are
not
to
be
permitted
the
right
to
travel,
three
categories.
the
first,
category
a
are
members
of
the
communist
party
who
have
recently
terminated
--
or
who
have
recently
terminated
such
membership
under
circumstances
indicating
of
the
view
of
the
secretary
of
state,
they
are
still
controlled
by
the
communist
party.
category
b
are
persons
regardless
of
a
formal
state
of
their
affiliation
who
engage
in
activities
which
supports
the
communist
movements
under
circumstances
indicating
the
view
of
the
department
as
subject
to
control.
and
category
c
on
page
67
are
persons
regardless
of
a
formal
state
of
their
affiliation
after
whom
there
is
reason
to
believe
on
the
balance
of
all
the
evidence
of
a
going
abroad
to
engage
in
activities
which
will
advance
the
communist
movement.
we
are
not
concerned
in
this
case
with
51.136
which
talks
about
people
who
are
going
abroad
to
violate
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
or
the
people
who
would
do
things
prejudicial
to
the
orderly
conduct
of
foreign
relations
or
even
prejudicial
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
we
are
concerned
with
51.135.
now,
the
question
is,
where
is
the
authority
for
51.135?
the
regulations
themselves,
your
honors
will
see
on
page
66
cite
a
single
statute,
22
u.s.c.211
(a).
and
that
statute,
which
is
on
page
59
of
my
brief,
is
also
disavowed
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
although
it's
the
only
statute
referred
to
the
regulations
as
a
source
of
the
secretary's
authority.
because
of
time,
i
won't
go
into
that
statute
because
the
government
has
conceded
that
it
does
not
give
it
the
power
to
control
travel,
but
merely
to
issue
passports
a
somewhat
different
problem
which
i
think
i
need
not
go
into.
the
government
now
however,
for
the
first
time
relies
exclusively
upon
the
mccarran-walter
act
of
1952,
print
--
8
united
states
code
section
1185
is
on
page
60
of
my
brief,
and
which
makes
it
a
crime
during
the
period
of
national
emergency
proclaimed
by
the
president
for
american
citizens
who
travel
abroad,
to
depart
from
the
united
states
or
to
enter
the
united
states
without
a
valid
passport.
your
honors
will
note
that
this
statute
is
not
cited
in
the
preamble
to
the
secretary's
regulations.
your
honors
will
as
a
matter
of
fact
note
that
this
statute
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
regulations
of
august
28,
1952.
and
finally,
that
the
statute
says
nothing
about
an
authority
to
the
secretary
of
state
to
control
travel,
and
if
it
had
said
anything
about
such
authority,
i
would
of
course
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
are
no
standards
in
the
statutes.
now,
if
this
statute
is
to
be
given
any
meaning
whatsoever,
it
would
have
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with,
as
a
complement
to
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
section
6.
that
was
the
statute
in
which
congress
decided
what
character
of
persons
should
not
have
passports.
and
that
statute
appears
at
pages
59
and
60
of
my
brief.
the
standards
set
forth
in
that
statute,
the
standards
set
forth
in
that
statute
is
a
single
one,
persons
who
are
members
--
presently
members
of
an
organization
found
by
a
final
order
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board,
to
be
a
communist
action
organization.
present
membership
in
an
organization
found
by
that
board
to
be
a
communist
action.
your
honors
can
compare
that
particular
statute
with
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
secretary's
regulations
and
the
differences
are
quite
obvious.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
shall
your
honor.
the
executive
order
referred
to
in
the
regulations
is
an
executive
order
which
merely
provides
that
the
secretary
may
issue
regulations
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
passports
which
regulations
must
be
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
executive
order.
the
executive
order
itself
following
the
tradition
of
executive
orders
from
the
beginning
of
this
nation
set
forth
no
substantive
conditions
for
the
right
to
travel
and
we
therefore
assume
that
when
the
executive
order
said
that
the
secretary
can
issue
a
regulation
consistent
with,
there
must
be
regulations
of
essentially
the
same
kind.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
now,
of
course
those
--
those
regulations,
that
regulation
of
7856
was
promulgated
at
1938
in
a
time
when
a
passport
was
not
necessary
for
travel.
and
we
are
now
discussing
a
situation
in
1955
and
1958
when
a
passport
has
become
necessary
for
travel.
the
president
has
never
in
any
regulation,
in
any
proclamation
said
that
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
issue
regulations,
establishing
substantive
conditions.
now,
with
regard
to
this
part
of
the
president's
executive
order
as
relating
to
the
normal
--
normal
right
to
issue
passports,
but
not
to
the
right
to
deny
passports
when
travel
is
a
condition
upon
it.
now,
the
secretary
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
would
be
true
and
that
would
--
i
think
that
would
provide
for
the
secretary
to
issue
regulation
of
the
same
procedural
time
that
he
always
had
issues
throughout
the
history
of
this
country,
not
regulations
which
determine
who
can
travel.
now,
the
government
cannot
find
any
content
in
the
mccarran-walter
act,
either
by
way
of
authority
to
the
secretary
to
control
travel
or
by
way
of
determine
--
setting
forth
the
standards
pursuant
to
which
this
travel
can
be
controlled.
and
so,
the
government
relies
upon
a
statute
of
1918
and
the
statute
of
1941,
predecessor
statutes
but
both
of
course,
dealing
with
war-time
situations.
and
the
government
cites
a
house
committee
report
in
which
it
was
indicated.
there
is
some
language
there
that
it
was
intended,
statute
of
1918,
to
present
espionage.
all
that
we
can
say
to
that
is
that
it
is
--
the
statute
of
1941
--
sorry,
the
statute
of
1952
which
is
here
involved
contains
no
authority
of
any
kind
and
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
read
into
that
statute,
a
house
committee
report
involving
a
1918
statute
involving
war
time,
and
war
time
espionage
as
an
authority
to
the
secretary
in
1952
to
promulgate
regulations
dealing
with
the
subject
of
communism
and
membership
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
and
we
may
also
add
that
of
course
in
1918
and
1941,
congress
had
not
spoken.
congress
had
not
said
that
a
certain
class
of
american
citizens
could
not
travel,
an
issue
that
is
not
before
this
court
of
course,
because
your
honors
recall,
there
is
no
final
order
involving
the
communist
party
or
everyone
else
as
a
result
to
the
litigation
that
has
been
in
the
courts
since
the
passage
of
the
mccarran
act.
but
what
is
significant
is
that
all
the
reading
of
the
mccarran-walter
act
at
least
gives
it
some
meaning
because
we
can
read
it
in
conjunction
with
the
act
of
1950.
the
secretary's
reading
gives
him
authority
carle
blanche
to
deny
the
right
to
travel
to
american
citizens,
no
limitations,
no
standards
whatsoever.
i
may
say
also
as
a
final
word
on
this
subject
that
the
regulations
of
1952,
august
28,
1952,
were
never
intended
to
be
based
upon
the
mccarran-walter
act,
aside
from
the
fact
they
don't
mention
it,
and
the
fact
the
act
wasn't
in
effect
then.
as
the
government
admits,
as
we
have
cited
secretary
or
secretary
office
is
admitting.
the
regulations
of
1952
are
intended
to
comply
with
what
the
secretary
believed
to
be
the
spirit
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
secretary
must
follow
the
latter
of
that
statute
and
not
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
spirit.
if
congress
determine
the
adequate
remedy,
namely
the
remedy
by
a
hearing,
certainly
consisting
of
more
due
process
than
has
--
than
has
occurred
here
on
the
part
of
the
secretary,
namely
hearing
before
the
subversive
activities
control
board.
and
then
a
relatively
precise
statement
of
who
it
is
who
is
to
be
denied
a
passport,
namely
a
present
member,
not
a
person
who
may
have,
in
the
view
of
the
department,
follow
the
communist
party
line,
not
a
person
who
may
have
been
a
communist
party
at
one
time.
we
are
not
here
arguing
the
constitutionality
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
we
think
that
the
objections
which
i'll
next
turn
to
are
very
substantial
objections
even
against
that
statute
but
are
not
to
the
same
degree,
namely
the
objections
under
the
first
amendment.
i
therefore,
now
turn
to
the
first
amendment
part
of
my
argument.
we
have
seen
here
that
there
are
sanctions
imposed
by
the
secretary
of
state.
the
sanctions
consist
of
a
restraint
of
movement.
may
not
seem
like
a
great
restraint
to
a
man
who's
confined
in
the
present
but
is
certainly
a
restraint.
and
it
is
a
restraint
which
has
had
an
effect
upon
the
professional
activities
of
these
men,
upon
dr.
briehl's
patient,
upon
his
medical
society,
upon
mr.
kent's
creative
work
and
of
course
upon
their
livelihood.
the
admitted
basis
for
the
restraint
is
the
exercise
of
lawful
activities,
disapproved
by
the
government,
there's
no
conceptual
questions
to
that.
it
referred
to
the
secretary
of
state,
the
attorney
general
and
congressional
committees
or
the
certain
character
as
the
government.
but
the
fact
is
that
these
are
all
lawful
activities
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
because
of
this
past
exercise
of
lawful
activities,
constitutionally
protected,
no
one
has
ever
charged
a
fine
here
on
the
part
of
either
petitioner.
these
petitioners
are
denied
this
liberty
of
movement
given
to
other
american
citizens.
i
may
say
of
course
that
we
have
called
attention
in
our
brief
to
the
vagueness
of
the
secretary's
standards
relying
upon
--
inquired
upon
statements
made
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
the
burstyn
case
which
i
will
not
quote
from
at
this
moment,
but
we
consider
equally
significant,
the
fact
that
there
are
lawful
activities
which
are
the
basis
of
the
denial
of
the
right
to
travel,
and
that
there
is
a
complete
indifference
for
the
purpose
of
the
travel.
it
makes
no
difference
from
the
secretary
of
state
whether
there
is
a
medical
convention
abroad
or
whether
a
man
wants
to
paint.
indeed,
mr.
kent
was
told
by
mr.
shipley,
the
former
director,
“i
will
not
give
you
a
passport
to
go
to
any
country
for
any
purpose.”
this
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
let
me
tell
your
honor
that.
i
get
it
in
two
ways.
first,
because
these
people
--
because
they
have
exercised
the
right
of
petition,
the
right
of
making
speeches.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
well,
i
should
have
that.
the
right
of
assembly.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
they
have
addressed
themselves
to
the
president
of
the
united
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
of
course
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course,
i
would
not
make
any
such
broad
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
--
i
am
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
may
i?
it
is
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
freedom
of
assembly.
if
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
well,
no.
i
--
i
--
let
me
turn
back
first
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
i
think
it
must
be
explicit
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
make
two
points,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
in
denying
the
liberty
of
movement
to
the
petitioners
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
it
probably
is
simply
a
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
government
concedes
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
it
certainly
not.
i
am
suggesting
to
your
honors
that
when
mr.
kent
is
denied
the
right
to
travel
because
he
has
petitioned
the
attorney
general
or
because
he
has
made
a
speech
or
because
he
has
taken
a
public
possession
or
when
dr.
briehl
is
denied
his
right
to
travel
because
he,
dr.
briehl,
wrote
an
article
for
a
magazine
called
"social
work
today"
with
--
which
the
attorney
general
disapproves
of
that
that
this
is
a
restraint
upon
dr.
briehl
and
mr.
kent
in
the
first
amendment
activities
which
they
exercised
in
the
past.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
it
comes
from
the
first
amendment
and
i
think
it
comes
from
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
i
--
your
--
your
honor
is
really
saying
is
liberty
of
movement,
the
first
amendment
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
i
would
say
liberty
of
movement
is
a
fifth
amendment
right
and
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
cannot
be
taken
away
from
the
petitioners
because
they
have
exercised
first
amendment
right
in
the
past.
that
was
really
my
point.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
make
it
that
clear,
your
honor,
before.
now,
the
--
the
secretary
of
state
takes
the
position
here
through
the
government
that
somehow,
or
that
something
may
happen
abroad
if
the
petitioners
go
there
which
justified
a
restraint
and
he
believes
as
something
may
happen
because
their
past
political
associations
are
to
him
undesirable.
and
we
have
never
really
had
it
specified
in
any
of
the
courts
or
indeed
in
this
court
whether
it
is
that
his
belief,
dr.
briehl
will
do
or
mr.
kent
will
do
if
they
are
abroad.
now,
even
if
it
was
specified,
even
if
we
were
told
what
they
would
do
when
they
went
abroad,
we
would
argue
that
this
is
a
form
of
prior
restraint.
we
thought
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
more
than
that,
and
where
they
declined
to
submit
the
examination
with
respect
to
other
matters
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
of
past
political
associations.
yes,
the
department
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
was
the
secretary's
position.
quite
so,
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
secretary
--
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
the
secretary
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
the
secretary
never
asked
--
offered
united
states
a
choice.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
would
be
this
case
if
we
were
limited
it
to
the
affidavit
issue,
but
we
aren't.
we
say
that
the
secretary
have
no
right
to
promulgate
--
political
regulations
at
all.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
if
we
pass
that
and
we
come
nearly
to
the
affidavit,
then
your
honor
would
have
a
point
on
the
affidavit,
but
we're
addressing
ourselves
to
the
basic
standards,
and
the
affidavits
we
regard
is
a
secondary
aspect
of
this.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
sure
you
--
i'm
sure
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
if
your
honor
thinks
that
the
secretary
has
a
right
to
ask
five
out
of
10
questions
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
then
that
--
i
must
put
aside
my
assumption
he
has
the
right
to
ask
none.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
therefore
--
therefore,
adopting
your
honor's
assumption,
my
answer
is
that,
no,
the
secretary
would
still
act
improperly
in
denying
a
passport
because
he
isn't
giving
us
a
choice.
he
knows
whether
he
will
take
three
or
four.
he
says
he
wants
them
all.
now,
we
aren't
suppose
to
pick
and
choose.
we
aren't
the
judges
there
.when
the
secretary
says
he
wants
10
answers,
we
can't
assume
that
he'll
take
three.
that's
really
my
position
on
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
well,
i
think
you
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
i
suppose
one
can
make
tenders
if
the
secretary
was
dividing
his
examination
into
separate
pieces.
but
this
a
full-scale
demand
of
a
right
to
examine
a
man's
political
associations,
or
the
right
to
ask
him
why
he
--
why
he
filed
the
petition
with
the
attorney
general.
why
he
invited
paul
robeson
for
dinner.
well,
we
aren't
supposed
to
take
each
one
of
these
100
questions
and
break
them
up
and
say,
“a
few
will
answer
and
then
in
few
cases,
we
won't
answer.”
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
suggest
as
if
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
i
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
never
think
that
anything
i
say
is
obvious,
your
honor.
i'm
merely
suggesting
that
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
secretary
is
the
best
one
to
decide
whether
he
will
take
a
few
answers
or
a
lot
of
answers
or
whether
he
will
insist
on
everything.
now,
i
may
say
that
there
is
a
question
that
the
--
the
secretary
here
relied
upon
the
japanese
relocation
cases,
upon
the
english
detention
cases,
upon
a.c.a.
against
dowd,
upon
the
alien,
upon
the
cases
like
garner.
and
of
course
all
of
these
are
distinguishable.
the
japanese
cases
and
the
english
cases
were
cases
of
actual
war
time
danger
and
they
are
extreme
cases,
these
cases
which
certainly
cannot
prevail
at
this
time.
a.c.a.
against
douds,
we
dealt
with
a
congressional
determination,
a
finding
that
communist
leadership
of
labor
unions
was
a
dangerous
thing
because
of
the
political
strikes
and
that
these
unions
have
been
given
tremendous
power
by
the
act.
and
therefore,
although
court
was
careful
to
say
they
weren't
actually
agencies
of
the
government,
i
think,
there
was
an
implication
of
responsibility
there
which
in
the
view
of
the
--
the
legislature
and
which
this
court
pay
deference
to,
justified
a
degree
of
control
over
this
union
leadership.
and
of
course
in
that
case,
the
unions
could
have
remained
with
their
union
officials,
communist
if
they
were,
simply
not
use
the
facilities
of
the
national
relations
board.
a
loss
and
a
substantial
loss,
but
the
unions
could
have
functioned.
we
of
course
cannot
travel
in
the
absence
of
passport.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
under
the
mccarran
act
of
1952,
it
is
made
a
crime
to
go
abroad
without
a
passport
in
the
event
of
a
national
emergency
declared
by
the
president.
in
january
17,
1953,
the
president
declared
such
a
national
emergency.
that
declaration
has
never
been
rescinded,
now
five
years
later.
i
think
i
will
reserve
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
your
honor
please.
i
must
say
that
i
gave
the
court
too
hasty
in
examination
of
1185
upon
which
the
solicitor
general
relies
and
will
the
court
look
at
page
61
and
see
from
the
language
there
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
my
brief.
thank
you,
sir.
whether
there
is
any
authority
to
the
secretary
of
state
in
1185
on
page
61
of
my
brief
to
control
travel,
to
set
up
systems
of
classes
of
people
who
may
not
travel.
and
if
there
is
such
an
authority,
are
there
any
standards
in
the
language
of
1185?
all
it
says
is
under
such
rules
of
the
president,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
depart
from
or
enter,
or
attempt
to
depart
from
or
enter
the
united
states
unless
he
bears
a
valid
passport.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
language
does
not
say
that
the
secretary
can
decide
who
can
travel
and
if
they
did
say
that
the
secretary
could
decide
who
could
travel,
it
would
be
an
obvious
unlawful
delegation
because
there
is
no
standard
in
that
language,
not
a
single
standard.
it
must
be
some
standard.
here,
we
have
no
authority
and
no
standard
and
merely
suggest
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
this
is
also
interpretation.
it
would
be
constitutionality
if
it
said
the
second
--
alone
if
the
secretary
can
restrain
travel,
but
it
narrowly
doesn't
say
that
the
secretary
can
restrain
travel.
but
it
says,
at
the
secretary
--
it
does
not
give
any
standards
upon
which
the
secretary
might
act.
well,
i've
been
obscure,
your
honor,
because
i
want
to
clarify
my
position.
if
1185
said
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
control
travel
with
determined
classifications,
there
would
be
authority.
and
then,
your
honors
would
have
to
look
at
that
statute
and
say,
“are
there
any
standards?”
but
since
the
statute
does
not
contain
even
that
authority,
you
may
not
reach
this
constitutional
problem.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
so.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
there
is
a
reason,
your
honor
why
that
can
be
done
here.
in
1952
when
this
statute
was
passed,
there
was
in
effect
a
determination
by
congress
as
to
the
kind
of
people
who
were
required,
who
could
not
have
passport,
namely
members
of
communist
action
organization.
but
with
the
end
of
the
war,
emergency
approaching
under
the
act
of
1941,
although
congress
said
that
certain
people
couldn't
have
passports,
they
could
nevertheless,
have
traveled
because
there
was
no
statute
except
for
the
emergency
statutes
of
the
past
which
would
make
a
passport
a
necessity.
therefore,
if
congress
wanted
to
prevent,
wanted
to
implement
the
act
of
1950,
this
was
the
way
in
which
it
could
be
done.
the
act
of
1950
says
this
group
cannot
have
passports
and
the
act
of
1952
says,
“you
cannot
leave
the
country
without
a
passport.”
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
secretary
of
power.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
and
may
i
also
tell
you
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
because
there
i
think
you
would
have
an
equal,
unlawful
delegation
because
they
are
on
those
standards
regarding
the
president.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
because
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
authority
even
to
the
president
that
1185
to
control
travel.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
say
that
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
i'd
say
the
secretary
of
state
can't
deny
a
passport
because
the
man
won't
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
may
i
answer
that
question,
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
by
--
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
exactly,
by
pointing
out
that
we
are
not
asking
for
a
--
a
document
introducing
us
to
a
foreign
power.
the
situation
is
different
in
1955
and
1958.
we
will
take
any
passport
that
is
issued
which
identifies
as
--
as
american
citizens
which
we
are
and
which
other
countries
will
then
permit
us
to
enter
as
a
result
of.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--i
--
yes.
yes,
i
do
but
i
don't
agree
that
this
is
political
document.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
below
as
your
honor
will
see
from
the
opinion
recognized
that
whatever
the
passport
once
was,
it
is
today
a
requirement
of
movement.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
no
longer
really
a
political
document.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
don't
--
we
are
still
in
here
for
a
piece
of
paper
we're
accredited.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
we
also
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
see
what
my
prayer
is.
my
prayer
asked
for
a
passport.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
on
page
4
of
the
record,
sir.
we
are
asking
for
a
passport
and
a
passport
as
we
construe
it
under
the
act
of
1926
which
is
not
prescribed.
the
form
of
the
passport
is
merely
a
certificate
of
identity
that
we
are
american
citizens.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
your
honor.
we
aren't
asking
for
any
particular
language.
if
the
language
is
significant
as
a
letter
of
introduction,
we
can
do
it
without
it.
we
simply
want
a
document
which
is
necessary
in
view
of
1185
to
leave
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
all
we
want
is
the
license
to
depart.
we're
preventing
from
departing
at
the
present
time.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
haven't
said
that
they
can
make
conditions,
no,
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
are
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
the
--
if
--
if
--
may
i
continue?
if
the
language
of
a
passport
which
is
used
at
the
present
time
is
regarded
as
a
--
an
introduction
to
a
foreign
power,
then
we
don't
need
that
language
and
our
request
for
relief
under
the
passport
act
1926
is
a
request
for
that
document
which
is
necessary
for
us
to
leave
the
country.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
know
because
that
isn't
my
problem
here,
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
my
--
my
problem
is
--
my
problem
is
that
they
had
imposed
the
condition
to
our
lawful
departure
and
that
condition
is
a
passport.
as
long
as
1185
is
on
the
book,
requiring
us
to
have
a
document
of
a
certificate
of
identity
or
whatever
we
call
it,
we
have
a
right
to
that
certificate
of
identity.
we
cannot
be
deprived
of
it
because
we've
exercised
these
rights
of
freedom
of
speech
into
dissociation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
i
think
i
can
answer,
your
honor.
we
have
not
claimed
that
1185
which
required
the
passport
as
the
condition
for
departure
is
unconstitutional.
as
we
read
if
--
we
don't
have
to
meet
that
issue.
1185
thus
state
what
the
law
is.
you
must
have
a
passport
to
leave
the
country.
we
are
saying
that
in
view
of
that
state
of
the
law,
as
represented
by
1185
which
we're
not
attacking
that
we
cannot
reside
as
the
passport
regulations.
the
secretary
must
give
us
a
passport.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
i
have
agreed
to
that,
but
i
have
also
said
if
i
may
repeat
that
the
secretary
may
not
condition
the
issuance
of
that
departure.
i
bet
your
honor
understands
me
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
upon
in
improper
conditions
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
that's
quite
true.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
--
we
have
no
--
we
--
we
can't
question
the
fact
that
for
example,
a
motor
vehicle
bureau
can
require
a
--
an
automobile
license
of
a
man.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
don't
--
we
don't
question
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
--
i
have
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
perhaps
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
point.
and
may
i
say
to
your
honors
have
had
a
construction
of
213,
a
construction
of
211(a)
which
appears
on
page
59
of
my
brief,
which
is
not
supported
by
the
language
there.
it
was
suggested
here
and
i'm
not
clear
whether
the
suggestion
is
still
made
by
the
solicitor
general.
but
under
211(a),
the
act
of
1926,
which
by
the
way
has
never
been
amended,
your
honors.
the
act
of
1926
was
not
amended
by
anything.
that
statute
as
is
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
at
one
point
authorizes
the
secretary
to
require
an
affidavit
at
the
communist
party
membership
and
these
other
things.
there
is
nothing
in
211(a)
if
your
honors
will
see
it,
which
contains
such
an
authority.and
in
those
several
cases
in
which
non-communist
affidavit
said
that
it
was
upheld
by
this
court
aside
from
the
fact
that
they
were
relatively
precise
affidavits.
i
have
to
use
that
term
and
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
required
here
with
the
course
of
the
examinations
of
dr.
briehl
and
mr.
kent.
in
all
of
those
cases,
whether
it
would
garner
or
aca
against
douds,
we
found
that
it
was
a
legislative
body
that
had
made
the
determination
of
such
an
affidavit
should
be
required.
here,
there
is
no
statute
in
the
united
states,
which
says
that
the
secretary
of
state
can
ask
for
an
affidavit
of
that
kind.
congress
has
not
asked
for
such
an
affidavit.
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
doesn't
ask
for
such
an
affidavit.
only
the
secretary
of
state
here
has
asked
for
that
affidavit.
they
got
a
complete
problem.
