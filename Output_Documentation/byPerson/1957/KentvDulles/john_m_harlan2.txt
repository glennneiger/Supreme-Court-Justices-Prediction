could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
posture
of
this
directivee?
i
had
understood,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
that
there
was
no
determination
made
here.
there
was
no
informal,
there
was
an
informal
hearing,
but
no
formal
hearing
that
things
came
to
an
end
in
the
department
when
your
clients
declined
to,
both
will
look
to
furnish
a
non-communist
affidavit?

right.

and
that
therefore,
the
secretary's
position
was,
if
that
stays
that
since
he
had
a
right
to
request
that
information
and
since
you
refuse
it,
that
ended
the
matter
and
he
will
justify
in
denying
a
passport,
is
that

you're
going

take
a

justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
date
of
the
original
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
the
first
time
this
statute
appeared
on
the
books?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
i
understood
the
petitioner's
argument,
it
was
that
if
you
took
the
1926
act
along
211(a),
that
that
did
not
authorize
the
asking
of
these
questions
and
did
not
authorize
the
request
with
the
noncommunist
affidavi.
but,
the
section
merely
related
to
questions
and
regulations
that
were
incident
to
the
mechanical
procedural
problem
of
issuing
a
passport.
now,
that
is
their
position.
i
understand
your
answer
to
that
is
you
don't
stop.
it
was
in
the
four
corners
of
the
1926
act.
you
say
you
can't
read
that
act
alone.
it
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
1185,
the
presidential
proclamation,
et
cetera.
and
when
you
put
those
two
acts
together
even
though
what
they
say
might
have
been
true,
if
1926
act
stood
alone,
that
act
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
these
other
acts
and
then
you
get
the
position
you
take.
justice
john
m.

isn't
that
your

position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
--
i
don't
understand
the
answer
and
i
thought
you'd
misspoken
yourself,
which
i
gather
is
the
fact
now
that
we've
force
this
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
could
you
put
the
answer
this
way
that
if
all
you
had
was
the
1926
act,
you'd
be
prepared
to
defend
your
position.we
don't
have
to
get
to
that
without
going
to
the
next
subject
with
him
because
you've
got
these
other
statutes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
constitutionality

justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
the
statute
is
sufficiently
ambiguous
so
that
as
a
matter
of
construction
we
can
avoid
the
constitutional
issue.
