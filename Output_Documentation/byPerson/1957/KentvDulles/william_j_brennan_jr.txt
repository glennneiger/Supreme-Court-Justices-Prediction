justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
are
you
saying
that
without
1185,
211
(a)
could
not
in
any
event
be
the
source
of
any
power
to
control
travel
under
the
guise
of
a
power
to
grant
or
refuse
passports?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
it
was
as
i
understood
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
other
words,
you
really
have
to
focus
on
1185
to
find
congressional
authority.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
what
i
have
with
reference
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
one
on
which,
that
mr.
boudin
is
not
--
and
still
being
outstanding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
before
you
leave
that,
mr.
solicitor,
i
--
well,
that
--
that's
to
suggest
that
could
be
done
--
although
the
questions
were
asked
for
the
purposes
of
controlling
powers
i
understand
it
on
the
basis
of
the
1926
act
without
reference
to
1185
or
the
1952
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
1926
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
what
i'm
looking
at
is
at
--
at
109
of
your
brief.isn't
that
the
1926
act,
211(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
1926?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
211(a)
is
the
19
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yet
the
federal
has
nothing
to
do.
i
thought
you
said
before
lunch,
i
thought
you
said
that
section
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
to
control
travel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have
to
get
at
least
the
--
the
authority
to
control
--
the
authority
to
control,
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
control
is
your
1952
act,
1185,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
i
asked
you
a
question
before
lunch
--
the
government's
concession
that
the
right
to
travel
is
a
liberty
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
carried
with
it
the
concession
that
this
could
not
be
defended
that
is
this
line
of
question
as
a
method
of
controlling
the
right
to
travel
could
not
be
defended
under
the
1926
statute
standing
alone.
i
may
--
perhaps,
i
must
admit
i
understood
you.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is,
may
be
defended
constitutionally
when
read
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
congressional
regulation
as
the
right
to
travel
found
in
1185.
was
i
wrong
in
--
did
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
subsection
(b),
you
recognized
in
the
provision,
"subject
to
such
limitations
as
the
president
may
authorize
and
prescribe,"
no
delegation
of
authority
to
the
secretary
to
promulgate
regulations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wanted
to
ask
a
question,
might
the
president
himself
set
lip
the
identical
regulations
under
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
understand
the
term
it,
but
not
on
--
not
under
the
absence
of
authority
in
the
statute
to
the
president.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
want
a
license
to
depart
lawfully?
