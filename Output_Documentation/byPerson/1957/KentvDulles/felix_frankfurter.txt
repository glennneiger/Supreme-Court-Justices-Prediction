justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
first
time
you
used
the
word
“a
right
to
petition”.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
right
of
petition
is
urged
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
bringing
--
he
may
not
have
the
right
of
petition
but
in
order
to
invalidate
something
on
some
constitutional
ground
--
ground,
we
must
refer
to
a
provision
of
the
constitution
or
something
that
is
inevitably
drawn
from
the
whole
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
which
part
of
the
--
we
just
announce
it
everytime
a
question
of
constitutional
order
comes
up
here,
just
first
amendment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can
call
the
universe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
which
part
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
the
first
amendment
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
freedom
of
speech
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
establishment
of
religion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
--
one
person
going
by
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
something
explicit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying,
something
else
is
undue
but
either
by
ancillary
government
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
does
that
come
from?
does
that
come
from
the
first
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
give
me
the
basis
on
which
you
asked
me
to
declare
action
of
congress
or
the
precedence
or
a
subordinate's
unconstitutional
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
asking
too
much?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
understood
you
that
your
main
ground
and
almost
the
major
premise
of
your
argument
is
that
here
is
an
unfair
limitation
upon
the
right
of
motion,
the
right
to
travel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
does
that
come
from
the
first
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
they
come
from
the
fifth,
but
does
it
come
from
the
first?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
was
--
i
appeal
--
i
can
understand
the
problem
better
if
it's
unlikely
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
does
that
mean
that
if
the
secretary
asks
certain
questions
by
which
say
as
judge
--
justice
washington's
view,
he
could
have
and
by
which
he
couldn't,
that
he
can
just
say,
"i
won't
answer
any
and
be
justified
because
they've
included
some
that
shouldn't
have
been
asked?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
you
passed
that.
but
you
passed
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
break
up
your
argument
into
three
or
four
positions.
i
can
deal
with
each
one
separately
just
as
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
--
i've
asked
you
a
specific
question
which
to
me
is
in
the
case,
namely,
the
secretary
asked
a
man
to
answer
10
questions.
suppose
agree
without
further
ado
that
five
of
them,
he's
unauthorized
to
ask.
may
an
applicant
for
a
passport
say,
“i
don't
propose
to
answer
any
of
these.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
at
this
point,
i'm
--
i
must
make
that
assumption
or
to
put
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
can
--
you
can
make
him
a
tender.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
answer
--
all
of
us
give
questions,
hasn't
--
we
answered
some
questions
and
not
answer
others.
we
can
ask
him.(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
that
--
that
answer
of
yours
doesn't
even
require
a
discussion?
that's
the
matter
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
so
obvious,
so
obvious
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
on
your
proposition
that
there's
no
power
to
withhold
a
passport
or
rather
that
a
man
can
go
abroad
without
a
passport.
what's
stopping
them
from
going
abroad
without
a
passport?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
terms
--
is
the
--
is
the
passport
printed
here
where
--
that
exact
terms
of
the
passport.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
could
you
have
a
copy,
a
struck
off
of
the
exact
text
of
what
it
is
that
the
passport
says?
i'm
thinking
of
--
i
like
to
see
what
the
present
passport
is.
maybe
i
could
look
at
some
of
my
old
ones,
compare
to
what
it
was
in
--
in
the
old
case
that
you
cite
in
the
d'arbel
case.
is
it
substantially
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
i
noticed
that
in
robert
e.
johnson
and
taney's
argument
in
1835-1
haven't
looked
at
the
statute,but
the
reporter
peter
gives
their
argument.
it
says
the
acts
of
congress
recognized
passport.
this
is
what
robert
v.johnson
and
tony
said
in
their
arguments
in
1835.
you
happen
to
know
that
those
--
what
those
recognitions
were
by
a
statute?
i
don't
think
they
are
refer
--
i've
just
looked
at
statutes
and
outside
of
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
case,
as
you
know,
is
a
passport
that
john
quincy
adams
signed
as
secretary
of
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
evidently,
he
must
have
thought
that
is
the
power
to
issue
passports.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
answer
the
question
of
whether
a
man
can
travel
and
have
consequences
follow,
deleterious
consequences
if
he
doesn't
get
one
of
these
documents,
which
is
the
problem
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congressional
authority
but
i
take
it
--
do
you
say
congressional
authority
or
--
or
congressional
actions
or
basis
for
the
secretary's
authority
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
it's
congressional
action
as
a
basis
for
the
secretary's
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
present
passport.
it
has
the
exact
language
for
the
passport
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
state
beyond
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you
to
--
to
tell
me
what
is
meant
by
--
what
is
implied
of
the
case
by
section
27
in
the
first
crime
that
says
in
1790.
i
believe
that
is
the
first
crime
accessed
by
the
congress,
april
30th,
1790.
section
27
says
that
if
any
person
shall
violate
safe
conduct
or
passports
duly
obtained
and
issued
under
the
authority
of
united
states
shall
be
punished
by
--
by
42
years.
what
does
that
mean,
to
violate
any
passport
duly
obtained
and
issued
under
the
authority,
how
would
you
be
violating
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
wasn't
--
the
violations
exist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
this
assumes
that
you
got
a
passport,
it
was
duly
obtained
and
issued
as
the
one
by
john
quincy
adams
was
in
that
early
case?
how
would
one
violate
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
country?
the
geographical
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
not
what
this
means.
if
john
quincy
adams
issued
a
passport
to
go
to
peru
or
belgium,
and
he
goes
to
the
then-prussia,
would
that
be
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
essentially
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
this
provision
continue
down
to
date?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
congress
imposed
a
sentence
of
three
years
for
that,
james
madison
and
the
congress?
that's
highly
illuminating.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
the
--
and
that
is
in
looking
at
the
terms
of
the
relief
prayed
for
that
the
petitioner
stand
on
the
act
of
1926.
now,
assume
they
can't
stand
on
the
act
of
1926,
could
be
--
what
if
any
of
the
--
of
the
demands
made
of
the
record
with
requirements
of
the
state
department
for
kent
and
justice
prettyman.
would
--
would
you
justify
under
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
do
you
think
it
was
restricted
in
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
or
wrong
-
i
really
don't
know-in
view
of
the
judgment
which
they
pray,
is
the
question
at
all
open
to
this
court
to
say
that
the
secretary
of
state
must
issue
the
passport,
put
aside
the
question
of
emergency?
the
secretary
of
state
must
issue
a
passport
to
these
applicants
for
a
passport
upon
refusal
to
answer
any
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
i
--
the
question
to
the
answer
you
gave
us
a
minute
ago
in
my
question
since
they
sent
--
since
they
claimed
rights
under
the
passport
act
of
1926
that
if
their
rights
aren't
on
their
own
requested
of
their
own
prayers
to
be
measured
by
their
rights
under
the
act
of
1926,
then
it
becomes
relevant
to
question
whether
the
government's
position
is
that
under
that
act,
the
procedure
of
the
secretary
of
state
is
dependable
or
justifiable,
right?
i
understood
that
you
said
yes,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
to
the
emergency
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
was
there
--
what
about
there
--
it's
a
given
out
there
and
you
suppose
you
--
you
deal
on
its
face.
what
is
there
on
the
1926?
assume
that
they
know
declaration
of
emergency
that
the
secretary
of
state
can
exact
as
the
conditions
in
granting
or
giving
a
passport?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
any
oath
of
the
1926
act
require
an
oath
who
disavowed
the
communist
membership
--
party
membership
with
your
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
you
could
say
you
can
grant
that,
the
basis
that
they've
prayed
on
they're
not
entitle
to
have
relief,
is
your
position,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that
but
you
say
that
would
then
justify
such
a
demand,
disavowing
membership
to
the
communist
party
on
the
basis
of
the
1926
act,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
tried
--
are
weak
in
their
first
prayer.
therefore,
plaintiff
prays
for
a
judgment
decreeing
that
the
plaintiff
--
this
is
page
six
of
the
481
record
--
plaintiff
prays
for
a
judgment
decreeing
that
the
plaintiff,
as
an
american
citizen,
is
entitled
to
a
passport
under
the
statutes
of
the
united
states,
including
the
passport
act
of
1926.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
states
then
their
rights
haven't
been
deposited
if
they
haven't
cut
come
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
answering
unequivocally
that
if
you
take
only
1926
unamended,
the
secretary
of
state
then
asked
the
applicant
to
swear,
could
asked
in
1926,
i
don't
know
when
he
did,
that
he's
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry.
211(a),
which
you've
just
been
talking
about-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
authorizes
the
secretary
of
state
to
grant
and
issue
passports,
etcetera
.
has
it
authorized
them
to
grant?
i
presume
it
also
authorizes
not
to
grant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
the
act
of
1926?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
petitioners
asked
for
this
to
have
relief.
they
say
-
including
the-under
the
act
of
1926,
secretary
dulles
must
issue
me
a
passport.
isn't
that
what
they're
asking
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
they
ask
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
can
you
satisfy
--
but
can
you
satisfy
by
acting
under
211
(a)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
their
claim
is
broad,
or
whether
their
reasoning
is
broad,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
they
asked?
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether,
under
that
provision,
with
the
added
qualification,
"under
such
rules
as
the
president
shall
designate"-
did
he
issue
any
rules
under
'26?
were
there
any
in
being?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
--
there
was
no
question
in
the
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
under
that
--
i
--
i'm
sorry
to
have
the
repetition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
seems
to
be
pretty
important.
under
the
authority
of
211(a)
so
what
could
it
act?
it
has
the
secretary
of
state
the
right
to
withhold
this
application
for
a
passport
because
they
wouldn't
answer
any
question,
and
he
taking
the
position
but
because
he
asked
that
question,
there's
no
reason
for
them
not
answering
good
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
1926
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
why
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
say
that
the
claim
isn't
--
that
he
can
travel,
though
he's
free
to
travel
because
if
he
be
travels
he
might
be
violating
a
criminal
law.
i
don't
think
we
can
again
give
a
declaratory
judgment
on
that
basis
because
you
can't
enjoin
the
criminal
prosecution
even
though
it
maybe
among
those
unconstitutional
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
if
you
throw
it
--
it
if
the
secretary
of
state
is
justified.
i
--i'm
not
--
i
really
am
positive.
if
the
secretary
of
state
was
justified
under
211(a),
not
to
grant
a
passport
because
the
petitioner
didn't
ask
the
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
why
doesn't
that
--
why
is
it
not
justified
with
the
secretary
of
state
and
how
can
get
a
remedy
against
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
by
statute
he's
allowed
to
make
that
denial
then
you
must
reach
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
that
denial
under
the
1926
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
under
the
1926
act,
he
may
impose
that
condition
to
the
granting
of
the
passport
and
whatever
consequences
may
it
pull
through
under
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
me
that
all
is
limited
to
and
defined
by
the
scope
and
constitutionality
of
the
act
of
1926.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor
--
if
you
had
nothing
but
the
act
of
1926
and
the
government
was
here
or
here
defending
the
right
before
issuing
a
passport
that
he
should
answer
certain
questions
would
the
government
do
one
this
year
saying
secretary
of
state
was
authorized
to
ask
those
questions,
the
refusal
and
the
constitutional
justification
of
asking
those
questions
leading
to
the
denial
of
the
passport.
of
course,
you
would
be
taken
away
his
rights
to
travel.
you'll
have
to
talk
about
that
because
if
--
if
you
may
condition
his
travel
on
having
a
passport
or
if
you
want
the
risk
of
going
to
jail
and
traveling
without
a
passport,
but
by
denying
him
a
passport,
you're
interfering
with
his
right
of
free
locomotion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
statute
--
the
criminal
sanction,
namely,
that
he
may
land
in
jail
for
violation
of
--
of
criminal
statute.
i
don't
see
how
i
can
make
a
declaratory
judgment
that
he
can't
be
possibly
because
you
can
enjoin
and
approve
a
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
didn't
you
ask
of
me
that
under
the
1926
act
that
he
had
nothing
else
the
secretary
of
state
can
ask
--
ask
of
his
affidavit
and
ask
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
--
there
is
no
record
in
any
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
--
do
not
say
you've
misspoken
yourself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
use
it.
i'm
just
putting
all
items,
i
want
you
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
very
simple
question
i'm
asking.
under
the
1926
act,
if
the
secretary
of
state
has
nothing
else
for
this
--
for
the
assertion
of
authority,
could
he
have
asked
these
questions
and
demanded
this
affidavit?
is
that
question
acceptable
of
an
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
there
if
your
answer
is
correct
that
the
--
that
the
secretary
of
state
may
exact
an
affidavit
because
then
the
petitioner
were
to
say,
in
exacting
his
affidavit,
you're
interfering
with
my
freedom
of
travel
because
you
are
making
me
disclose
some
privacy
that
i
do
not
want
to
disclose.
that
is
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
mr.
boudin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
deny
with
all
your
prayers
squarely
deny
--
do
you
deny
that
the
secretary
that
you
deny
the
constitutional
power
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
withhold
issuing
a
passport
whatever
good
it
may
do
to
pursue
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don's
say
as
though
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
if
he
has
no
delegated
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
his
constitution
moving
on
but
the
congress
of
the
united
states
can
give
the
secretary
of
state
the
power
to
deny
me
a
passport?
i'm
assuming
that-you
say
that
an
american
citizen
has
the
right
to
tra
vel
without
having
a
document,
whatever
he
may
get
out
of
that
-
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
put
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
deny
that
the
secretary
of
state
can
satisfy
himself
before
he
issues
that
political
document,
as
you
call
it,
that
you
don't
belong
to
the
-
that
your
client
doesn
't
belong
to
the
communist
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
i
missed
something
but
you
just
said
that
you
don't
deny
that
you
may
be
required
to
have
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
secretary
of
state
accrediting
you
to
a
friendly
nation.
do
you
deny
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
what
you
inform.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
still
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
will
you
please
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
you
please
turn
to
your
prayers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let's
turn.
le's
go
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
it's
something
over
the
signature
of
the
secretary
of
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
has,
as
i
have
indicated,
exactly
the
same
language
that
it
has
had
since-
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
you
agree
that
the
government
put
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
make
conditions
upon
your
reason
to
leave
with
that,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
your
--
well,
look
at
your
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
seem
familiar
with
it.
look
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
based
on
a
judgment
between
that
the
plaintiff
and
the
american
citizens
was
entitled
to
a
transport
under
the
statute
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
the
passport
act
of
1946.
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
language
is
more
words
to
put
in
the
conflict
of
something
in
our
position.
when
you
asked
for
a
passport,
i
assumed
you're
asking
for
the
kind
of
document
that
is
issued
under
the
seal
of
the
state
department
since
1789.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
arguing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
agree
that
constitutionally
the
congress
of
the
united
states
may
provide
that
mr.
kent
and
dr.
briehl
can't
leave
the
united
states
without
giving
a
document
which
amounts
to
(inaudible)
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
want
your
problem
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
repeat
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
a
right
to
a
cer
tificate
of
identity
and
you
must
get
it
from
the
secretary
of
state,
you
must
either
agree
that
the
congress
may
make
such
requirements
upon
my
leaving
this
country,
or
you
must
say
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
insist
on
pressing
my
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
now
agree
that
it
is
not
beyond
the
constitutional
power
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
to
condition
on
american
citizen
leaving
this
country
to
get
some
kind
of
piece
of
paper
from
the
secretary
of
state,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
in
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
i
understand
that
you
and
i
would
agree
that
the
secretary
of
state
can't
be
authorized
by
the
congress
before
issuing
me
passport
to
find
out
what
my
religion
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
i
--
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear
that
you're
asked
and
by
asking
agree
to
the
constitutional
power
to
have
the
secretary
of
state
condition
your
leaving
and
mine
on
the
granting
of
some
kind
of
a
piece
paper
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
it
gets
down
to
what
the
conditions
may
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
made
such
suggestion
that
is
like
a
motor
vehicle
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
bureau
can
require
an
automobile
license
of
a
man.
we
don't
question
that.
