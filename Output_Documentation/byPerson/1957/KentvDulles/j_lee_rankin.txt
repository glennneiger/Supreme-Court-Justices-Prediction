mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
concedes
before
this
court
that
there
is
a
right
to
travel
and
believe
that
it
was
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
that
concession
was
made
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
i
don't
think
we
are
entitled
to
any
credit
for
it.it's
our
duty
and
obligation
to
this
court
and
the
country,
as
soon
as
we
are
able
to
learn
that
we
are
wrong
to
come
forward
and
say
so
and
we
do.
that
does
not
decide
this
case
however.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
much
more
complex
than
counsel
has
indicated
to
this
court.
the
question
that
seems
to
us
stops
at
the
threshold
in
these
two
cases
and
is
best
considered
if
we
recognize
that
the
secretary
here
refused
to
proceed
with
these
proceedings,
hearings
or
processing.
in
any
respect
because
of
one
thing,
the
refusal
of
these
petitioners
to
give
the
affidavit
that
was
required
in
--
under
the
proceedings
that
the
secretary
had
set
out.
so,
we
then
reach
back
into
the
question
of
what
authority
used
there
under
the
law
for
the
secretary
to
require
of
these
things,
and
we
first
have
to
turn
to
the
statute.
now,
it's
been
claimed
that
the
government
never
called
attention
before
to
this
--
to
this
statute
in
regard
to
travel
control,
section
1185.
and
in
our
brief
on
pages
13
and
31,
this
very
case
before
the
court
of
appeals,
we
call
attention
to
both
of
those
statutes
and
say
that
they
have
to
be
construed
together
in
order
to
determine
the
right
to
the
parties
and
the
authority
that
we
conceive
in
this
case.
now,
that's
not
the
brief
in
this
court,
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
did
call
attention
to
this
very
point
in
developing
in
our
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals
because
it's
charged
here
that
this
is
the
first
time
we
raised
that
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
the
problem
in
regard
with
the
statutes
are
these.
the
government
would
have
an
easy
time
of
it,
if
we
could
just
say
that
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
grant
or
deny
passports
either
inherently
or
by
statute
and
thereby,
the
petitioners
have
no
rights
to
travel.
because
if
we
could
put
that
statute
to
11
(a)
and
its
predecessors
in
a
water-tight
compartment
one
side
and
say,
“you
examine
that.”
i'm
satisfied
but
this
court
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
for
a
period
of
--
143,
there
are
some
three
years
or
some
lesser
period,
at
least
since
1856.
that
power
has
been
exercised
both
as
an
inherent
power
of
the
secretary
and
also
recognized
by
congress
in
later
years
whereby
he
has
issued
passports
and
denied
passport
or
that
long
history
of
this
country.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice,
but
it's
referred
to,
i
think
in
a
footnote,
the
nature
of
it
and
it's
recognized
that
it
is
a
political
document.
and
it
asked
the
--
the
foreign
country
to
recognize
this
person
and
treat
him
with
consideration
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
so,
mr.
justice
but
my
co-counsel
says
he
thinks
it's
in
the
brief
and
we'll
--
since
we
find
it,
i'll
tell
you,
call
it
to
your
attention.
that
statute
of
--
but
first,
this
power
was
exercised
by
the
secretary
over
such
a
long
period
of
years
and
the
government
claims,
i
want
to
make
this
clear,
that
there
is
the
inherent
power
in
the
secretary
to
grant
or
deny
the
passport,
but
it
does
not
claim
the
power
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
at
all
to
grant
or
deny
the
right
to
travel.
our
problem
is
not
as
difficult
here
because,
it
--
in
fairness
to
the
petitioners,
it
seems
to
the
government,
that's
the
only
way
you
consider
this,
can
--
can
properly
consider
this
question
is
to
take
both
of
these
statutes
which
clearly
congress
intended
to
do
in
the
history
and
it
--
its
consideration
of
this
problem
and
try
to
put
them
together
because
the
congress
took
this
power
that
the
secretary
had
been
exercising
over
a
considerable
period
of
years
as
an
inherent
power
and
later
recognized
by
the
congress
and
passed
in
this
statute
in
which
there's
a
general
statement
of
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief,
and
said,
“take
this
power
of
granting
or
denying
a
passport
that
you've
got
over
here,
mr.
secretary,
and
you
act
upon
it.”
and
then
they
passed
over
here,
a
separate
statute,
1185
and
i'll
call
your
attention
to
it
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief,
the
government's
brief
in
which
they
said,
“if
you
don't
have
this
passport
that
the
secretary
grants
or
denies,
you
can't
travel.”
so,
we
say
that
the
government
must
face
up
to
the
proposition
that
it
must
consider
both
of
these
statutes
and
we
think
the
petitioners
must
barely
consider
both
of
them
in
order
to
try
to
construe
the
rights
of
the
parties
in
--
in
this
case
before
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
sorry,
mr.
justice,
i
don't
recall
that
particular
--
but
there
was
a
recognition
back
in
1814
of
the
restriction
in
travelling
from
parts
of
the
united
states,
outside
back
in
those
days
and
there
was
also
by
secretary
seward,
a
restriction
that
he
made
that
was
not
statutory
at
all.
now,
we
don't
claim
that
the
government
has
that
power,
that
the
executive
branch
has
that
power
to
do
it
on
its
own,
but
he
did
exercise
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
such
a
recognized
power
by
all
sovereign
countries.
that
has
been
exercised
all
over
the
years,
but
that
doesn't
solve
our
problem
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
the
--
it's
always
been
treated
over
a
great
period
of
years
as
a
document
that
said,
“mr.
citizen
a
is
entitled
to
travel
as
a
respected
citizen
of
our
country
throughout
the
various
countries
that
are
designated
or
except
for
the
questions.”
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
and
we
have
to
reach
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
congress
properly
could
tie
these
two
powers
together,
that
is
the
travel
control
and
say
that
it
will
be
measured
and
regulated
by
whether
or
not
a
man
has
or
it
does
not
have
a
passport
and
then
examine
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
congress
actually
did
that
very
act
in
it's
passing
of
the
statutes,
whether
the
statutes
are
broad
enough
to
cover
what
the
secretary
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
we
say.
so
that
if
there
is
such
power
that
is
the
use
of
the
passport
power
to
control
travel.
it's
got
to
be
found
in
1185.
i
would
say,
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
only
thing
that
i
would
like
to
add
to
that
is
it
seems
to
me,
the
history
shows
that
congress
contemplated
the
use
of
that
in
such
a
way
that
it
--
it
considered
that
they
were
making
the
two
statutes
and
that
it
was
using
this
passport
control,
but
it's
that
particular
statute
that
gave
the
right
to
grant
or
deny
passports,
did
not
give
the
right
to
grant
or
deny
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
travel,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
very
largely
or
entirely.
the
problem
--
the
consideration
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
all
right.
now,
section
1185
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
a
and
it
provides
in
--
generally,
in
regard
to
the
proclamation
of
the
emergency.
there's
no
question
between
the
parties
that
that
emergency
was
proclaimed
by
the
president
and
that
thereafter,
it
also
provides
that
he
proclaim
that
these
restrictions
be
necessary
in
that
emergency
and
that
was
proclaimed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
at
page
29
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote,
the
language
of
the
passport
is
set
out.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
on
page
31,
there
are
some
references
about
at
the
bottom
of
page
30
and
carrying
on
to
31
our
references
to
some
enactments
by
the
congress
in
which
it
had
recognize
the
power
of
the
secretary
was
being
exercised
to
grant
or
deny
passports
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
now,
turning
to
the
appendix
at
page
102
of
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
important
language
is
in
1185,
the
paragraph
numbered
1.
no,
that's
not
it.
in
paragraph
b,
i'm
sorry,
1(b)
that's
on
103,
citizens
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
president
and
subject
to
such
limitations
and
exceptions
as
the
president
may
authorize
and
prescribe
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
depart
from
or
enter,
or
attempt
to
depart
from
or
enter
the
united
states,
unless
he
bears
a
valid
passport.
and
then,
you
proceed
over
to
page
104
and
on
to
105
and
there's
an
--
a
proclamation
of
emergency.
then,
106
and
107
is
a
proclamation
by
the
president
as
to
an
emergency
and
to
the
need
for
the
passport
control
under
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
it
is
still
outstanding,
yes.
then,
in
paragraph
numbered
1
on
page
107,
provides
the
departure
and
entry
of
citizens
and
nationals
of
the
united
states
from
entering
the
united
states
including
the
canal
zone
and
all
territory
and
waters
continental
or
insular,
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
shall
be
subject
to
the
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
published
and
so
forth.
and
then,
in
paragraph
numbered
4,
it
goes
on
in
regard
to
the
proclamation
and
makes
a
part
of
the
proclamation,
all
of
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
in
regard
to
the
issues
of
passports
in
accordance
with
this
statute
and
the
proclamations.
then,
on
page
109,
we
have
the
provisions
in
regard
to
the
granting
of
the
passports,
the
statute
that
empowers
the
secretary
to
grant
or
deny
passports
and
it
incorporates
in
the
first
paragraph
there
at
six
--
section
211(a)
under
such
rules
as
the
president
shall
designate
and
prescribe
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
and
in
213,
it
provides
for
an
application
for
passport.
it
requires
that
they
submit
a
written
application,
duly
verified
by
its
oath
before
a
person
authorizes
them
the
power
to
administer
oaths.
we
continue
recital
of
every
matter
of
fact
which
maybe
required
by
law
or
by
any
rules
authorized
by
law
to
be
stated
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
issues
of
any
such
passport.
and
the
secretary
proceeded
to
make
a
regulation.
but
first,
we
have
the
executive
or
the
number
of
7856
on
110,
providing
for
affidavits
and
support
an
application
for
passport.
and
then,
section
51.77
authorizes
the
secretary
of
state
to
make
the
passport
regulations.
531
provides
that
anyone
who
doesn't
bear
such
a
--
a
valid
passport
issued
under
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
state
shall
not
--
shall
not
travel
beyond
the
western
hemisphere.
then,
the
secretary
of
state
prescribed
certain
regulations
set
out
on
page
112.
and
51.135
is
the
one
of
particular
interest
in
this
case
and
subparagraphs
a,
b
and
c.
then,
turning
to
page
115,
section
51.142
is
the
secretary
as
distinguished
from
the
president's
giving
it
authority
to
the
secretary
to
provide
for
applications,
affidavit
and
oath,
the
secretary's
requirement.
then,
before
their
affirmation
by
applicants
be
given
as
to
membership
in
the
communist
party,
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
in
the
passport
division
and
before
the
board,
if
it
was
deemed
necessary,
the
applicant
maybe
required
as
a
part
of
his
application
to
subscribe
under
oath
or
affirmation
to
a
statement
with
respect
to
present
or
past
membership
in
the
communist
party.
if
applicant
states
that
he
is
communist,
refusal
of
the
passport
in
this
case
will
be
--
be
without
further
proceedings.
now,
that's
the
--
taking
that
frame
through
those
various
statutes
and
the
proclamations
and
the
regulations,
the
government's
position
that
the
proclamations
and
regulations
were
provided
for
and
authorized
by
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
construes
that
it
has
to
be
used
to
be
violated
and
the
--
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
often
this
--
often
the
passports
are
restricted.
in
fact,
that's
a
common
practice.
now,
to
stamp
on
passports
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
if
they
cannot
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
way
i
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
read
it.
and
the
government
construes
that
the
person
has
to
use
the
passport
in
order
to
be
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
in
this
particular
kent
case,
the
evidence
i
think
is
uncontradicted
but
mr.
kent
went
into
iron
curtain
countries
and
to
moscow
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
his
passport
on
several
missions
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that's
discussed
in
the
case,
but
it
is
not
a
ground
for
the
action
here.
the
ground
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
termination
of
these
proceedings
or
failure
to
furnish
the
affidavit
is
proper,
lawful
and
whether
not
if
the
petitioners
have
lost
rights
that
they
are
entitled
to
under
the
constitution
and
law
and
is
the
cause
of
that
and
so
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
secretary
having
the
power
to
require
such
an
affidavit
and
in
general
terms
at
that
time.
we
believe
that
the
statutes
and
regulations,
proclamations
that
i
referred
to,
do
authorize
the
requirement
of
an
application,
that
the
application
is
necessary
for
the
secretary
to
get
the
facts
from
which
he
can
be
able
to
issue
or
deny
the
passport
and
also
that
the
requirement
under
the
oath
is
reasonable,
it's
expressly
provided
for
by
not
only
the
--
the
regulations
of
the
secretary,
but
also
the
proclamation
of
the
president.
and
going
back
into
the
history
of
these
four
matters,
which
largely
developed
in
the
war
period
of
1914
and
later
years
the
congress
addressed
itself
to
this
question
of
travel
control
because
it
found
and
there's
a
considerable
history
of
the
--
in
the
hearings
about
it
that
passports
were
being
used
by
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
further
the
war
efforts
and
the
various
espionage
and
subversive
activities
of
germany
during
world
war
i
and
prior
thereto.
and
it
is
because
of
that
investigations
have
found
that
it's
very
expensive,
both
in
this
hemisphere
and
in
europe
of
this
activity
that's
going
on
that
the
congress
authorized
this
authority
to
restrict
this
travel
control
and
prevent
or
prohibit
where
the
secretary
was
able
to
find
it,
the
conduct
of
american
citizens
in
that
way
in
aiding
the
war
effort
of
--
of
foreign
power.
then,
the
act,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
too,
that
until
the
--
until
the
act
of
1952,
this
power
of
--
of
travel
control
was
limited
to
war
periods
and
it
was
in
the
act
of
1952
that
the
congress
extended
this
to
the
emergency
proclamation
as
well
as
providing
that
it
should
cover
any
war
period.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
1918.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
in
this
type
and
form.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
we
think
that
the
--
the
problem
would
be
the
same
under
that
act
as
it
is
under
the
1952
act.
there
would
be
the
same
general
provisions
in
regard
to
the
authority
for
travel
control
and
they
were
carried
down
through
the
years
were
the
only
difference
in
1952,
being
the
provision
of
adding
that
if
a
person
declared
an
emergency
as
distinguished
from
war
period
and
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
that's
my
recollection.and
that
further
that
he
would
have
to
declare
that
these
travel
controls
were
necessary
under
the
1952
law
and
the
earlier
statutes
provided
that
in
--
during
a
war
period,
they
would
be
affected.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
would
think
that
question
is
only
open
to
the
court.
if
you
should
decide
that
the
secretary
has
no
right
to
ask
any
questions
or
to
control
travel
by
refusing
a
passport
in
any
event
and
that
you
were
satisfied
with
a
position
of
the
petitioners
that
if
they
prove
citizenship,
the
secretary
had
no
discretion
whatsoever
and
had
to
issue
a
passport.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
can
exact
an
application
and
that
application
is
in
the
form
of
an
oath
that
isn't
--
that
has
to
be
sworn
to,
answering
the
various
questions
that
he
sits
--
sees
fit
to
promulgate
in
order
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
say
in
heir
position
is
it
that
we
cannot
make
such
demands.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
the
--
the
section
211
(a)
which
is
the
section
in
the
immigration
nationality
act
and
i
think
it's
the
amended
section
that
they're
relying
on
and
that
they
don't
try
to
go
back
as
far
as
1926,
on
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
think
they
would
take
that
as
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
no,
but
it
was
involved
with
the
question
of
--
of
the
contemplation
of
the
--
all
that's
developed
since
with
regard
to
communist
activity
since
1926.
it
wouldn't
be
limited
to
whatever
the
situation
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that'd
been
my
position
is.
there's
also
the
period
of
the
--
of
world
war
ii
during
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
correct
construction
is
that
1185
has
to
be
read
with
the
innovation
of
the
nationality
act
is
now
addition
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
oh
as
in
--
it
was
the
amended
act.
it
was
carried
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
1926
act
in
regard
to
the
right
to
travel
is
1185.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
211(a).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
regard
to
the
right
to
issue
the
passport.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes,
except
that
1185
was
a
re-enactment
of
the
earlier.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
i
think
their
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
their
claims
is
broader
than
that.
they
say
that
you
can't
deny
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
under
211(a),
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir,
a
presidential
rule
under
211(a).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
sir.
or
he
takes
the
position
that
he
could
ask
the
questions
including
the
questions
in
regard
to
membership
past
or
present.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
under
--
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
under
the
1926
act,
211(a).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
take
into
control
that
denying
a
passport
takes
away
his
right
to
travel.
and
if
that's
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
then
you
have
to
see
whether
the
two
together
are
within
the
constitutional
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
due
process.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
their
position
is
that
that
action
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
state
by
reason
of
1185,
reaches
in
to
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
travel
because
of
the
fact
that
--
that
the
two
are
tied
together
by
the
congress.
and
therefore,
by
just
the
act
of
denying
a
passport,
the
secretary
tells
him
he
can't
travel.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course
their
position
is
that
we
can't
ask
that
question
because
the
consequences
that
flow
from
it
are
taken
away
from
a
right
that's
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
its
our
position
that
we
can
ask
a
question
that
he
hasn't
answered
the
question,
so
we
get
down
to
this
point
where
he
hasn't
exhausted
his
remedy
by
answering
the
question
and
that's
how
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
try
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
--
if
you
construe
that
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
can
deny
or
grant
a
passport
whether
the
secretary
has
that
power,
it's
the
government's
position
that
there
isn't
any
question,
but
what
he
has
it
inherently
and
congress
has
recognized
and
granted
over
a
period
of
--
long
period
of
years.
but
it's
also
the
government's
position,
we
believe
it's
in
this
case
that
you
can't
disregard
1185
because
that
says
that
if
you
deny
the
passport
over
here,
you
take
something
away
from
the
same
time
over
here
and
that
it
would
not
be
of
something
you
take
away
is
the
constitutionally
protected
right
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
so
that
we
have
to
treat
both
statutes
in
common
as
congress
said
as
the
measure
of
whether
you
have
the
right
to
travel
under
8
--
1185.
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
you
get
a
passport
over
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
there
were
times
when
granting
or
denying
of
the
passport
would
not
preclude
you
from
traveling.
it
was
a
--
you
could
travel
anyway
without
a
passport
during
the
history
of
our
country
and
they
were
not
the
sanction
that
go
with
the
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
statutes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
were
several
periods
during
our
history
of
the
different
periods
when
the
--
the
passport
was
required,
but
during
the
entire
period
that's
involved
in
this
case,
he
had
to
have
a
passport
in
order
to
travel
because
the
statute
required
and
there
was
criminal
sanctions
if
he
didn't.
now,
we
in
our
footnote
in
our
brief,
we
call
attention
to
the
court
the
fact
that
we
could
claim
that
it
--
what
the
argument
could
be
made
that
under
the
statute
in
regard
to
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
grant
or
deny
a
passport,
that
you
didn't
have
to
consider
1185
because
all
it
was
really
involved
here
was
that
you
didn't
file
the
affidavit
or
you
didn't
make
the
oath.
and
therefore,
the
secretary
was
authorized
regardless
of
anything
else
not
to
grant
the
passport.
but
we
felt
that
that
didn't
dispose
of
this
case
properly
for
the
court.
and
the
court
would
have
to
go
further
to
examine
the
effect
of
that
act
and
if
you
say
to
a
man
that
unless
you
get
a
passport,
you
can't
travel
and
he's
got
the
right
to
travel,
constitutionally
protected
right
to
travel
subject
to
whatever
due
process
and
rights
in
the
fifth
amendment,
whatever
lawful
limitations
there
are
under
the
fifth
amendment.
then,
you
have
to
go
on
to
examine
that
question
and
that
it
isn't
as
simple
as
it
would
be
for
the
government
if
we
just
said,
“it
all
depends
on
sectio
211(a),”
and
if
you
find
it,
the
passport
is
probably
denied,
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
position.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that'
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
think
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
i
did
answer
that
that
way
but
i
want
to
put
a
caveat,
that
i
feel,
in
frankness
with
the
court,
it
isn't
a
proper
solution
or
approach
to
this
case
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
not
to
reach
in
to
what
the
effect
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
1185
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
what
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
sorry
if
i
have
confused
you
and
i
took
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
only
if
i
say
further
that
as
long
as
the
section
1185
was
on
the
books.
i
think
you
have
to
face
up
to
what
effect
it
might
have
if
you
deny
the
passport.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
my
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
that
1185
helps
and
hurts
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned.
in
that,
it
puts
to
him
sanctions
that
we
have
to
deal
with
--
with
regard
to
a
constitutional
problem
that
if
we
just
had
211(a),
it
wouldn't
be
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
overlooked
that
particular
sanction
that
he
would
be
complaining
about,
but
he
has
a
more
difficult
and
more
burdensome
sanction
that
he
is
complaining
about
here
that
he
might
have
all
these
penalties
to
cover.
