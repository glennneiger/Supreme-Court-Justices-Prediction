justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
it
had
--
had
been
a
direction
of
a
new
trial,
you
would
not
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
not
mean
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
you
want
--
asking
us
to
do
is
restore
the
original
judgment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
plaintiff,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
alternatively
in
any
event,
what
you
have
at
trial
on
the
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
under
--
underlying
south
carolina
question
is
resolved,
i
gather
that
south
carolina
has
a
factor
under
which
this
respondent
might
be
a
statutory
employer,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
issue
really
is
then
one
of
fact
whether
this
respondent
is
or
is
not
a
statutory
employer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
that's
the
underlying
south
carolina
question
as
settled.
there
was
no
dispute
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that,
the
south
carolina
law
has
a
special
definition
of
statutory
employer
that's
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
legally
insufficient?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
question
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
a
recent
decision
on
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
suggest
that
they
might
take
a
different
view
of
this
in
this
pleadings
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
whether
this
court
ought
to
decide
this
or
that
or
the
court
of
appeals,
but
in
light
of
that
opinion
to
that
decision
in
south
carolina
court
consider
the
question
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
alternatively,
did
you
raise
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
they
disagreed
with
you
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
affirmative
defense
that
at
least
there
should
be
a
remand
for
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
your
petition
for
rehearing
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
hammer,
may
i
get
back
just
a
moment
to
the
other
question
we
were
talking
about.
i
noticed
that
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
this
is
it
say,
"in
consequence,
both
the
owner
and
the
contractors
whom
he
engages
to
do
his
work
are
subjected
to
the
requirements
of
the
act
and
the
workers
receive
double
protection."
now,
is
that
what
you
say
is
contrary
to
the
recent
holding
of
the
south
carolina's
supreme
court
in
the
adams
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
this
is
a
flatly
erroneous
statement
of
south
carolina
law
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
stated
in
the
adams
case,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
were
--
you
--
your
point
is
that
this
petitioner's
employer
was
not
voluntarily
under
the
south
carolina
act
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
required
to
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
where
--
where
do
--
where
does
the
fact
in
that
regard
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
significance
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
significance
of
the
deletion
according
to
the
footnote
by
the
trial
judge
of
that
statement
from
the
answer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
excluded
from
the
answer
then
does
not
mean
stricken
from
the
answer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
merely
was
not
read
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
stands
as
part
of
the
pleading,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
did
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
opinion
anywhere
refer
to
that
provision
or
otherwise
state
that
the
bouligny,
if
that's
the
name
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
bouligny
was
required
to
operate
under
the
compensation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
have
it,
i
see
it
at
page
59,
it
was
conceded
in
the
court
below
that
both
blue
ridge,
the
owner,
and
bouligny,
the
contractor
had
complied
with
and
were
operating
under
the
compensation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
you
mean
blue
ridge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
elected
and
over
--
earlier
it
says
that
the
bouligny,
it
--
was
operating
under
the
requirement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
significant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
mr.
hammer.
mr.
walker.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
walker,
does
that
mean
that
even
if
there
is
merit,
i'm
not
suggesting
there
is,
just
as
a
hypothesis,
in
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
treated
the
workmen's
compensation
act
contrary
to
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
did
in
the
adams
case.
assuming
that
was
so,
that
nevertheless,
the
petitioner
could
not
here
be
heard
on
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
need
to
argue
that
now.
i'm
--
i'm
asking
--
assuming
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assuming
that
that
was
--
is
a
sound
argument,
are
you
telling
us
nevertheless
he
cannot
be
heard
because
of
the
events
which
you
referred
us
to
at
page
4?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
i'm
trying
to
get.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
is
--
what
is
your
argument
but
--
in
answer
to
his
--
based
on
the
adams
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
i
noticed
that
the
--
that
the
south
carolina
court
observes
here
is
that
the
emporium,
that
was
the
immediate
employer,
i
have
the
opinion
here,
was
voluntarily
under
the
act
and
is
what
this
holding
you
--
are
you
suggesting
this
holding
really
is
only
this
that
the
statutory
employer
is
nevertheless
liable
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
immediate
employer
was
voluntarily
under
the
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
page
40
to
42,
mr.
walker?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
walker,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
other
question,
on
this
matter
of
the
plaintiff's
giving
testimony
on
this
issue
at
the
trial
court.
you
referred
us
to
pages
48
and
49,
the
colloquy
between
the
court,
yourself,
and
mr.
hammer.
i
noticed
that
when
mr.
--
when
the
court
addresses
mr.
hammer,
he
--
the
phrases
that
i
find,
at
least
two
or
three
times
here,
in
the
event
i
overrule
your
motion,
do
you
contemplate
putting
any
testimony
in
reply?
is
there
any
significance
in
the
--
in
the
event
i
overruled
your
motion
bearing
on
what
we're
interested
into?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
was
--
wasn't
the
court
in
effect
saying
to
him
--
perhaps,
your
motion
is
well
taken,
mr.
hammer.
but
if
i
don't
agree
with
you
and
i
overrule
it,
are
you
going
to
be
prepared
to
offer
some
testimony
on
the
subject,
isn't
that
what
it
meant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
why
should
he
--
when
the
court
finally
ruled
with
him
and
dismissed
your
affirmative
defense,
why
is
he
penalized
to
--
not
to
be
allowed
to
expand
the
record
on
that
issue,
we,
in
the
remand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
he
may
have
other
evidence
as
i
understand
it.
one
of
his
points
here
is
that
if
he
had
an
opportunity
now
that
the
--
if
the
law
has
established
for
the
court
of
appeals
includes
him
in
the
case
that
he'd
have
evidence
to
establish
but
in
fact
you
are
not
engaged
in
the
same
business
as
the
petitioner's
employer
was
engaged
in.
and
therefore,
that
the
workman's
compensation
act
provision
on
which
you
rely
is
not
applicable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
as
i
understand
it
that
he
has
evidence
that
had
an
opportunity
to
present
would
establish
that
the
defense
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act
upon
which
you
rely
is
not
a
good
defense
because
it
would
be
inapplicable,
as
i
understand
his
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
in
--
i
didn't
quite
read
it
that
way.
i
thought
the
condition
that
was
being
put
to
him
by
the
trial
judge
was
that
as
the
motion
was
not
well-taken
and
was
overruled
that
the
motion
to
dismiss,
would
he
be
prepared
to
come
across
with
some
additional
evidence.
and
he
said
or
come
forward
rather,
i
frankly
don't
know
what
this
point
of
any
reply
that
is
necessary.
i
don't
know
of
any
evidence
in
this
case
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
i
don't
see
that
that's
any
--
suggesting
that
there
is
no
evidence
available
if
it
was
necessary
to
bring
it
forward.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
that
question
of
law
even
though
it's
for
a
judge
and
not
a
jury
to
determine
as
i
gather
at
least
north
carolina
practice
holds,
yet
based
upon
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
not
what
he
was
getting
at,
that
he
wanted
a
chance
to
show
that
if
he
had
to
do
it,
he
could
produce
facts
which
would
sustain
the
merit
of
his
motion
as
a
matter
of
law.
that
as
i
understood
him
and
the
trial
judge
in
effect
said,
“no,
you're
using
--
you're
putting
out
any
more
evidence
i
think
already
your
motion
is
well-taken
on
whatever
this
is.”
and
granted
his
motion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
walker.
are
you
meeting
into
the
erie-tompkins
question
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
much
time
you
have
left
but
i'd
like
to
hear
your
view
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
on
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
it
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
hammer,
i
might
understand
from
what
you've
just
said
that
if
you
had
an
opportunity
to
offer
evidence
to
meet
the
evidence
of
the
respondent
on
the
affirmative
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
evidence
would
show
both
that
under
this
contract
with
the
petitioner's
employer
and
the
work
of
these
three
men,
which
you've
mentioned,
both
required
the
making
of
service
connections
to
residences.
does
this
contract
require
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
i
don't
quite
understand
your
analogy
to
the
hammering
of
the
nail.
are
you
saying
to
us
that
this
contract
never
called
for
service
connections
to
residences
that
if
that
was
done,
it
was
done
only
by
these
three
employees
or
the
maintenance
crew
of
the
respondent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand,
but
do
you
know
what
the
fact
is
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
call
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
contract
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
to
the
work
covered
by
the
contract,
is
that
a
portion
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
that
at
--
at
any
--
in
any
event,
these
three
employees
never
constructed
substations,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
read
it
that
way
for
what
comfort
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
none
of
this
court
of
appeal
judges
had
ever
sat
and
--
or
not
even
lawyers
of
south
carolina.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
more
than
a
former
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
