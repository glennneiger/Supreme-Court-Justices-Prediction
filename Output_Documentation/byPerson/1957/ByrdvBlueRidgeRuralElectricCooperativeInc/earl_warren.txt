mr.
hammer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
gentlemen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hammer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
since
they
had
--
according
to
his
testimony
as
you
read
it,
since
they
had
last
built
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
had
testified
that
the
company
had
constructed
one
about
three
years
before
and
then
on
his
cross-examination
he
stated
that
was
not
the
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
point
out
to
us
in
the
record
the
particular
testimony
of
mr.
(inaudible)
that
you
rely
upon
to
show
that
there
were
three
substations
constructed
by
this
company.
where
can
we
find
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
forty-three.
what
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
that?
now,
let's
take
it
from
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
rather
have
the
testimony
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
don't
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
there
was
some
departure
from
that,
was
there
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
one
built
two
or
three
years
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
34.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
says,
"i
beg
your
pardon,
i
like
to
change
that
sir,
if
i
may.
we
have
a
station
at
oak
way
and
that
would
be
seven
and
duke
power
has
what
we
call,
eliminate
our
client.
that
wasn't
clear
in
my
mind."
but
where
does
he
say
that
--
why
does
he
say
that
they
--
where
and
when
the
company
constructed
these
three
substations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
i
understood
you
just
say
there
is
no
repudiation
on
that,
can
you
show
me
in
the
record
where
his
final
statement
that
you
rest
on
said
that
the
company
did
build
station
a,
did
build
station
b,
did
build
station
c?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
it's
material?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
if
they
had
built
some
of
the
substations
and
so
25
years
ago
and
they
built
a
great
number
of
them
since
all
by
contract.
you
would
say
that
the
fact
that
they
did
built
some
25
years
ago
made
it
a
part
of
the
business
of
this
corporation
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
take
it
that
no
building
built
for
a
manufacturer
or
a
power
company
or
any
other
kind
of
a
--
of
a
company
becomes
a
part
of
this
operating
business
until
it's
completed
and
--
and
used
for
that
purpose,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
that
term
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
beside
the
point
we're
discussing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
not
beside
the
point
we've
been
discussing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hammer,
you
have
a
couple
of
minutes
left.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
walker.
