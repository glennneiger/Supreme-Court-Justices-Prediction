mr.
wesley
m.
walker
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
honorable
court.
as
the
court
has
seen
from
the
transcript,
the
respondent
here
is
a
rural
electric
cooperative
operating
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
it
was
created
by
a
special
statute,
the
rural
electric
cooperative
act
of
south
carolina.
and
in
the
course
of
his
business
through
the
years,
it
entered
upon
and
continued
a
very
large
expansion
program.
this
program
went
on
for
years
being
largely
done
by
its
own
employees.
upon
occasion,
the
respondent
here
would
contract
for
a
certain
work
to
be
done.
in
1952,
the
respondent
here
led
a
contract
after
procuring
a
loan
from
the
federal
rule
electrification
administration
and
this
contract
contemplated
this
construction
of
a
body
to
seven
miles
of
conversion
lines
and
about
24
miles
of
new
lines
and
also
for
two
substations.
the
petitioner
here
was
an
employee
of
the
contractor,
bouligny,
that
is
the
contractor
was
his
immediate
employee.
we
point
out
there
to
the
court
that
the
statute,
72-11
of
the
south
carolina
code
of
laws
of
1952
contemplates
the
letting
of
work
by
contract
and
for
that
work
that
is
done
by
contract
to
be
a
part
of
the
work
of
the
owner,
that
is
the
employer.
reading
from
72-11
which
is
on
page
two
of
our
briefs,
it
says
that
in
this
section
and
section
72-113
and
72-114
referred
to
as
owner,
“when
any
person
undertake
to
perform
or
execute
any
work
which
is
a
part
of
his
trade,
business
occupation,
and
contracts
with
any
other
person
referred
to
as,”
in
this
section
and
section
72-113
to
116,
“referred
to
as
subcontractor,
for
the
execution
or
performance
by
or
under
such
subcontractor
of
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
work
undertaken
by
such
owner.
the
owner
shall
be
liable
to
pay
to
any
workman
employed
in
the
work
any
compensation
under
this
title
which
he
would've
been
liable
to
pay
if
the
workman
had
been
immediately
employed
by
him."
my
point
there
is
that
the
statute
itself
contemplates
the
contracting
of
the
work.
we
say
here
that
the
work
being
done
was
a
part
of
the
trade
and
business
of
the
respondent.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
statute
is
the
general
workman
compensation
part
of
a
general
one,
workmen's
compensation
statute
of
south
--
south
carolina.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes.
that
is
correct.
and
here,
the
petitioner,
at
the
time
of
his
injury
had
climbed
a
substation
that
was
under
construction.
he
was
not
injured
by
the
substations
but
he
reached
out
and
contacted
a
line
that
was
connected
to
the
substation
on
the
outside
and
that
he
was
going
to
measure
what
they
call
a
jumper
and
he
was
going
to
measure
that
line,
that
jumper
to
connect
it
from
the
line
on
the
outside
to
a
point
on
the
inside
of
the
substation.
it
was
then
that
his
injury
occurred.
thereafter,
this
petitioner
as
shown
by
the
record,
collected
his
compensation
from
the
insurance
carrier
for
his
immediate
from
--
of
his
immediate
employee,
that
is
the
bouligny
company.
this
action
was
subsequently
brought.
the
sections
or
in
the
answer
as
shown
in
the
brief,
i
submit
that
first
we
play
it,
the
workmen's
compensation
law
of
south
carolina
as
a
bar
alleging
that
the
employee,
that
is
the
petitioner,
claimed
it
below,
had
collected
his
workmen's
compensation
and
that
he
was
barred
by
the
act.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
through
his
counsel
moved
to
strike.
at
the
same
time,
we
moved
to
amend
to
specifically
add
this
portion
of
the
statute
including
the
words
that
the
work
being
done
was
a
part
of
the
trade,
business,
and
occupation
of
the
employer.
the
trial
judge
allowed
the
amendment
and
denied
the
motion
to
strike.
the
case
came
on
for
trial
and
immediately
before
going
into
the
courtroom,
the
jury
having
been
drawn,
there
was
a
conference
before
the
district
judge
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
the
motion
as
made
by
the
plaintiff's
counsel,
that
is
the
petitioner
here.
and
at
that
time,
the
plaintiff's
counsel,
the
petitioner
here,
moved
to
eliminate
from
the
case
all
evidence
relating
to
workmen's
compensation
excepting
the
one
item
of
whether
or
not
the
work
being
done
was
a
part
of
the
trade
and
business
of
the
owner-employer,
the
respondent
here.
the
court
will
see
on
page
2
which
my
adversary
read
a
moment
ago
at
the
top
and
there
the
court
repeated
in
substance
his
motion.
as
i
started
out
to
say
in
the
very
beginning,
what
you
are
doing
now,
you
are
moving
that
they
not
be
allowed
to
read
that
defense
before
the
jury
because
it
is
a
legal
defense,
purely
a
question
of
law
and
must
be
decided
on
legal
grounds.
later
on
and
following
all
over
to
page
4,
the
defense
in
the
motion
was
discussed
and
thereupon,
upon
the
petitioner's
motion
and
by
the
trial
judge,
everything
was
excluded
excepting
the
point
as
stated
toward
the
bottom
of
page
4.
mr.
william
stated,
"the
only
question
left
would
be
whether
or
not
this
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
business
of
blue
ridge."
in
other
words,
was
the
only
question
that
would
be
left
is
and
the
meaning
of
the
workmen's
compensation
act
was
the
plaintiff,
the
employee
of
blue
ridge
electric
that
would
be
the
only
question
left.
mr.
hammer
stated
that's
correct.
we
submit
that
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
there,
the
trial
judge
concluded
that
here
was
a
question
of
law.
the
petitioner's
counsel
was
contending
to
the
court
that
it
was
purely
a
question
of
law.
time
and
again
during
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
stated
that
it
was
strictly
a
question
of
law.
and
at
the
time
that
petitioner
made
his
motion
to
strike,
the
district
judge
then
stated
that
it
was
a
question
of
law.
there
was
no
question
at
that
time
and
there
was
no
question
before
the
trial
judge
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
elements.
that
was
not
mentioned
before
his
answer.
the
argument
was
and
the
district
judge
concluded
that
it
was
strictly
and
purely
a
question
of
law
and
we
submit
that
the
district
judge
made
his
decision
upon
an
erroneous
concept
of
south
carolina
law.
the
district
judge
said
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
the
district
judge
concluded
and
stated
that
the
work
being
done
was
not
a
part
of
the
trade
and
business
of
the
owner,
the
employer
who
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
--
i
think
i'm
answering
you
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
took
that
position
at
the
very
outset
before
we
went
into
the
courtroom
by
moving
it
to
be
eliminated
and
excluded
upon
grounds
that
it
was
strictly
a
question
of
law
and
his
statement
on
page
2
as
the
court
repeated
his
motion
and
he
said
that
at
that
time
that
he
was
moving
because
it
was
a
legal
question
and
a
question
only
for
the
court
to
decide.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
submit
that
the
petitioner's
argument
with
respect
to
the
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
did
not
follow
you.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
submit
--
yes
sir,
i
submit
that.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
do
contend
that
because
here
was
a
question
of
law.
now,
may
i
go
further
in
that
direction?
we
submit
that
the
evidence
here
is
abundant.
i
challenge
the
statement
of
my
adversary
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
the
evidence
here
was
amply
abundant.
there
was
a
testimony
of
mr.
(inaudible),
the
manager.
there
was
the
testimony
of
mr.
(inaudible),
the
engineer.
there
was
the
contract
which
was
introduced
into
evidence.
all
of
that
is
clearly
set
forth
in
what
we
currently
--
carefully
documented
opinion
of
the
court
below.
i
believe
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
we
submit
that
he
is
--
he,
our
petitioner
here,
my
adversary
is
drawing
an
improper
conception
of
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
said.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
adams
versus
davison-paxon
case
affirmed
the
doctrine
that
has
stood
for
many
years
in
south
carolina
dating
back
to
marchbanks
versus
duke
power
company.
the
marchbanks
versus
duke
power
company
is
the
bedrock
of
this
principle
in
south
carolina
and
it
has
been
affirmed
time
and
time
again.
the
ballard
case
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
here
had
been
decided
and
was
reported
prior
to
the
time
of
the
adams
versus
davison-paxon
case.
but
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
not
recognize
the
principal
advocates
in
the
ballard
case
that
unless
the
employer
was
under
the
act
and
had
the
actual
liability,
then
he
would
not
have
any
immunity.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
marchbanks
case,
it's
been
--
it
cites
the
maryland
case
of
the
state
versus
bennett
building
company.
and
there,
they
point
out
that
the
basic
principle,
before
they
emphasized
theories
that
if
the
owner,
the
employer,
the
statutory
employer
is
under
the
act
to
bear
its
liabilities,
it
must
also
be
accepted
and
is
under
the
act
to
bear
its
immunities.
and
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
we
do
not
think
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
or
not
the
immediate
employer
was
a
volunteer
or
compulsory
under
the
act.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
if
the
employer
has
in
excess,
i
believe
it
is
a
14
employees
then
he
must
come
under
the
act.
and
i
do
not
think
--
we
do
not
concede
that
the
whole
decision
would
turn
upon
whether
or
not
the
employer
had
14
or
more
or
less
employees.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
he
makes
that
point
in
his
reply
brief,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
what
he
says
in
his
brief
on
the
merits.
he
says
on
page
31
of
his
brief
on
the
merits,
in
making
his
point
--
his
point
in
(inaudible)
is
as
follows
which
appears
on
page
28.
the
record
is
void
of
the
evidence
required
by
south
carolina
law
to
run
the
applicable,
the
workmen's
compensation
act
as
a
defense.
then
he
says
on
page
31,
the
ruling
of
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
south
carolina,
honorable
c.
c.
white
involved
a
question
of
local
substantive
law
of
south
carolina.
his
ruling
was
in
accord
with
correct
principles
of
law
and
in
consonance
with
the
reasoning
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
miles
versus
west
virginia
pulp.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
that
was
on
page
31
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
--
of
the
brief
on
the
merits
and
then
he
comes
in
for
the
first
time
in
his
reply
brief
and
we
find
it
on
page
20
where
he
says
that
it
is
a
procedural
question.
but
in
his
brief
on
the
merits,
he
has
previously
stated
that
it
was
a
question
of
local
substantive
law
of
south
carolina.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
prior
to
the
petition
here,
there
has
been
no
question
in
the
court
below
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
but
assuming
the
point
correctly
raised
here
or
anywhere
else
for
the
first
time,
we
say
that
the
evidence
is
abundant.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
judge
--
justice
soper.
in
the
court
below,
it
appears
in
the
transcript.
his
documentation
of
the
facts
on
pages
59,
60
and
61,
he
outlines
them.
i
will
not
go
into
them
here.
we
have
outlined
them
and
dealt
with
them
extensively
in
our
brief.
but
we
submit
this
that
the
question
here
primarily
is
a
question
of
law.
to
go
back,
there
would
be
nothing
to
submit
to
the
jury.
the
question
of
coverage
which
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
the
question
of
coverage
under
the
south
carolina
workmen's
compensation
act
is
a
question
of
law
for
the
court.
that
was
clearly
decided
in
adams
versus
davidson-paxon.
it
was
previously
decided
in
a
number
of
cases
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
law
in
all
jurisdiction.
certainly,
it
is
clearly
annunciated
time
and
again
under
the
south
carolina
law.
now,
if
there
is
no
question
here
for
the
jury,
if
it
was
strictly
a
question
of
law,
then
there
could
not
be
any
deprivation
of
right
of
this
petitioner
with
regard
to
his
rights
under
the
seventh
amendment
as
to
a
jury
trial
because
that
question
was
entirely
within
the
prerogative
of
the
court
and
they
tried
it
again.
it
was
still
being
questioned
for
the
judge
to
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
coverage.
there
is
no
submission
under
our
south
carolina
law
and
any
law
that
i
know
of,
may
it
please
the
court,
where
a
question
of
coverage,
a
jurisdictional
question
is
to
be
decided
by
the
jury.
now,
with
regard
to
what
transpired,
at
the
time
of
the
motion
by
the
petitioner,
the
respondent
here,
the
defendant
had
completed
his
case
and
thereupon
the
petitioner,
plaintiff
below,
moved
to
strike
this
affirmative
defense.
at
that
time,
the
district
judge
inquired
if
he
had
anything
in
reply,
he
asked
a
direct
question.
the
court
said
in
the
event,
i'm
reading
from
page
48
at
the
bottom
of
the
transcript,
the
court
said
in
the
event,
i
overruled
your
motion
that
you
contemplate
putting
up
in
a
testimony
in
reply.
you
have
that
right
of
course,
on
this
point,
i
mean.
my
adversary
stated,
we
haven't
discussed
it
but
we
are
making
that
motion.
i
frankly
don't
know
at
this
point
of
any
reply
that
is
necessary,
i
don't
know
of
any
evidence
in
this
case.
the
court
reporter
placed
the
days
there
but
there,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
said
he
knew
of
no
evidence.
he
pursued
his
motion
and
the
district
judge
prior
to
any
ruling
upon
that
motion
stated
that
in
the
event
he
granted
it,
he
would
permit
the
respondent,
the
defendant
in
the
court
below
to
include
the
grounds
of
that
defense
as
a
ground
for
his
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
which
the
court
assumed
that
we
would
make.
thereupon
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
then
again,
he
asked
the
petitioner
if
they
had
any
testimony
in
reply
and
they
said
that
they
had
none.
then,
the
court
permitted
us
to
make
our
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
and
we
submit
that
there
again
was
a
question
presented
to
the
petitioner
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
made
an
election
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
they
proposed
to
offer
any
testimony
in
reply.
the
opportunity
was
given
to
them
time
and
again.
and
reading
a
moment
ago
from
page
48
where
i
read
the
statement
of
the
court
and
of
counsel,
folio
353
on
page
48
will
show
the
grounds
that
the
petitioner
here
made
in
his
motion
to
strike.
he
stated
there
in
his
motion
was
that
we
move
to
strike
the
affirmative
defense
with
respect
to
those
allegation
that
the
plaintiff
is
precluded
or
excluded
from
bringing
this
action
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
in
work
which
is
part
of
the
trade,
business,
and
occupation
of
the
defendant
within
the
meaning
of
the
workmen's
compensation
act.
for
the
reason
that
it
has
been
conclusively
demonstrated
that
the
defendant
is
not
engaged
in
the
business
of
constructing
substations
and
the
business
of
bouligny
was
one
for
the
construction
of
substations
and
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
under
which
the
defendant
was
incorporated,
it
was
he,
engaged
in
the
business
of
supplying
and
distributing
electricity.
now,
that
was
the
grounds
of
its
motion
and
it
was
directed
against
the
part
of
that
defense
which
had
been
agreed
upon
and
ruled
by
the
court
in
the
conference
immediately
preceding
the
trial
that
there
was
only
one
issue
here
and
if
we
establish
that
defense
then
the
petitioner
concede,
the
district
judge
concluded
that
we
would
have
a
complete
defense.
with
regard
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
byrd,
which
my
adversary
would
affect,
we
submit
that
the
testimony
itself
stands
in
the
record
to
be
examined
by
this
court.
there
was
no
recanting,
there
was
no
retraction.
not
only
that,
it
was
corroborated
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
(inaudible)
the
engineer
who
was
employed
and
used
by
the
respondent
here
in
connection
with
all
of
the
expansion
of
its
electrification
program.
the
record
shows
and
mr.
(inaudible)
testimony
shows
that
they
employed
some
16
men
at
all
times
who
engaged
two-thirds
of
that
time
in
construction
work,
one-third
of
that
time
in
what
might
be
called
maintenance
or
repair
work.
there
is
no
place
in
the
testimony
where
mr.
(inaudible)
takes
back
or
recants,
or
retracts.
what
mr.
(inaudible)
does
is
to
point
out
that
the
three
substation
which
he
stated
that
the
respondent
coop
had
constructed,
that
those
three
substations
were
all
constructed
prior
to
the
time
of
the
six
which
were
then
and
then
used
as
of
the
date
of
the
trial.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
according
to
his
testimony
as
i
recall,
it
had
been
some
two
or
three
years.
i
would
have
to
go
for
the
record
up
on
that.
i've
--
i
believe
that
it
had
been
several
times.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
would
say
this
that
they
--
according
to
his
testimony
that
they
constructed
the
original
substations.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
first,
i
would
refer,
your
honor
to
page
43.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
of
our
brief
on
the
merits.
i
wish
to
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
all
right,
sir.
i
wanted
--
i
wanted
to
refer
you
there
because
there,
we
summarized
the
testimony
of
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
all
right,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
on
page
31,
he
was
asked
a
question,
"have
any
been
constructed
by
his
own
employees
similar
to
the
one
near
walhalla
that
has
been
under
discussion
in
this
case?"
answer
-
"yes,
sir.
we
have
built
substations
of
that
nature.”
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
question
-
“do
you
recall
how
many
substations
the
cooperative
has
built
with
its
own
employees?”
answer
-
"yes,
sir,
we
built
three."
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
there
were
some
departure
from
that
on
cross-examination
as
to
one
particular
substation
as
i
recall
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
built
that
particular
substation.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
on
page
34
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
--
mr.
--
the
question
was,
"mr.
(inaudible),
do
you
recall
when
the
substation
near
walhalla
was
completed
and
turned
over
to
the
cooperative
for
use?"
he
said,
"no,
sir.
i
don't
recall
the
exact
date
but
i
believe
it
was
in
march
or
february
of
1952."
that's
not
your
question,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
that
was
on
the
recall
and
the
cross-examination
and
the
question
was,
"is
your
oak
way
station
what
you
mean
by
tigerville,
the
one
at
oak
way?”
and
he
said,
“we
do
have
a
station
at
oak
way
and
that
would
be
seventh.
duke
power
company
has
what
we
call,
eliminated
our
tigerville
station.
that's
why
it
wasn't
clear
in
my
mind.”
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
don't
recall
that
he
said
exactly.
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
that
he
testified
directly
that
as
to
the
dates
when
these
three
were
constructed.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
was
ever
asked.
i
don't
think
that
he
was
ever
asked
with
regard
to
those
three
stations
that
were
built.
when
did
you
build
each
one?
i'm
not
there
when
that
was
asked.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
in
the
record.
we
submit
that
in
so
far,
he
did
not
testify
directly
the
record
as
to
when
and
what
as
to
each
particular
one.
there
was
no
effort
to
show
that.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
there.
the
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
material
in
the
--
in
the
least,
sir.
we
submit
that
the
testimony
insofar
as
all
of
the
work
that
was
being
done
including
the
matter
of
constructing
the
substation
would
be
shown
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
(inaudible),
by
the
contract
itself
and
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
(inaudible)
but
as
to
when
and
where
they
may
have
built
any
particular
one.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
material,
with
regard
to
the
work
being
done
under
this
contract
being
a
part
of
the
trade,
business
and
occupation
of
the
respondent.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
as
long
as
the
work
that
was
being
done
entered
into
and
became
a
part
of
and
directly
into
and
became
a
part
of
the
business
of
the
respondents,
the
owner.
we
submit
that
it
would
constitute
a
part
of
our
trade
and
business.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
don't
think
that
a
building
built
by
a
manufacturer
could
become
a
part
of
its
operating
business
until
it
is
completed.
but
may
i
emphasize
here
that
the
petitioner
was
not
injured
by
this
substation.
he
had
climbed
up
the
substation
and
had
used
it
merely
as
a
platform.
he
was
standing
on
the
substation.
he
contacted
a
line.
he
reached
out
and
contacted
a
newly
constructed
line
that
had
been
constructed
as
a
part
of
the
conversion
program
under
this
contract.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
and
it
was
relied
that
he
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
sir?
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
think
that
it
is
in
direct
answer
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
it
is
a
--
where
the
thing
that
caused
his
injury
is
a
part
of
the
work
of
business
and
trade
that
was
being
carried
also.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
think
that
there
would
be
some
significance
there.
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
the
court
giving
him
notice,
it
was
providing
him
with
every
opportunity
to
protect
himself
that
they
are
--
he
did
have
the
occasion
because
he
could
have
put
in
a
testimony
in
and
reply
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
think
that
he
is
penalized.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
hear
you
there,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
he
stated
into
the
record,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
he
did
not
know
of
any
evidence
and
that
was
immediately
upon
the
motion
being
made
and
the
court
asked
him
that
question
right
in
the
beginning.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
was
not
brought
up
at
that
time
with
regard
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
it
was
still
--
been
in
there
strictly
a
question
of
law,
a
question
of
coverage
as
to
whether
or
not
the
work
being
done
was
a
part
of
the
trade
and
business
of
the
owner-employer.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
it
would
be
based
upon
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
but
the
trial
judge
based
his
granting
of
the
motion
upon
an
erroneous
concept
and
that
he
said
that
the
work
that
was
being
done,
he
said
it
in
this
way,
he
said
that,
“we
were
not
in
the
contracting
business.”
and
he
said
that,
“unless
we
work
in
the
contracting
business,”
then
he
did
not
consider
that
the
work
that
we
were
doing
or
the
work
that
was
being
done
would
be
a
part
of
our
trade
and
business
and
that
is
clearly
on
the
record
as
to
the
basis
upon
which
the
trial
judge
made
his
ruling.
and
we
say
that
that
was
an
erroneous
concept
to
the
south
carolina
law
and
not
upon
the
basis
that
they
might
have
some
reply
testimony
that
would
contradict
or
change
the
facts
to
your
circumstances.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
honorable
court.
the
rights
and
remedies
here
involved
were
created
and
controlled
by
virtue
of
a
south
carolina
statute.
in
our
brief,
we
referred
to
the
case
of
caughman
versus
columbia
y.m.c.a.on
page
23
in
which
case
it
is
stated,
"it
was
stated
in
marchbanks
versus
duke
power
company,
et
al.,
that
workmen's
compensation
acts
or
in
derogation
of
or
departures
from
the
common
law
and
are
not
a
mandatory
cumulative
or
supplemental
thereto,
nor
declaratory
thereof
but
wholly,
substitutional
in
character."
these
rights
and
remedies
pursuant
to
workmen's
compensation
acts
are
unknown
to
common
law.
certainly,
the
constitutionality
of
workmen's
compensation
acts
in
the
various
states
have
been
tested
time
and
again.
i
believe
this
court
held
in
the
mountain
timber
company
versus
state
of
washington
with
respect
to
the
washington
compensation
act,
that
it's
between
employee
and
employer
the
act
abolishes
all
right
of
recovery
in
ordinary
cases
and
therefore,
leaves
nothing
to
be
tried
by
jury.
now,
the
issue
of
the
affirmative
defense
of
the
respondent
in
the
present
case
was
before
the
court
from
the
outset.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
affirmative
defense
was
confronted
with
issue
by
motion
four
times
during
the
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
am
partially
there.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
thank
you.
i
will
get
into
that.
there's
one
matter
i
wish
to
touch
on
first.
it
will
revert
around
to
it,
mr.
justice
brennan.
now,
there
were
four
motions
made
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
first
motion
was
by
the
petitioner
at
the
outset
to
conceal
the
compensation
issue
from
the
jury
because
it
was
a
question
of
law.
the
second
motion
was
made
by
the
respondent.
i
made
the
motion
at
the
close
of
the
petitioner,
the
plaintiff's
testimony
by
way
of
involuntary
dismissal,
contending
that
the
plaintiff's
own
testimony
showed
that
the
work
being
done
was
a
part
of
the
trade
and
business
of
the
defendant,
and
therefore
the
workmen's
compensation
defense
was
a
bar
to
the
plaintiff's
action.
third,
at
the
close
of
the
respondent's
testimony,
the
plaintiff
moved
to
dismiss
the
defense.
and
at
that
time,
the
court
inquired
of
the
plaintiff
if
he
had
any
testimony
throughout
there
and
reply.
then
following
that,
and
before
exercising
his
ruling
on
the
motion,
the
trial
judge
stated
that,
“now,
the
defendant
here
is
going
to
make
a
motion,
another
motion
in
connection
with
his
defense
at
the
close
of
all
the
testimonies.
do
you
have
any
evidence
to
put
in
by
way
of
replying?”
the
plaintiff
said,
“we
make
our
motion
now.”
then
following
that,
the
district
judge
said
that
he
would
grant
the
motion.
but
in
so
doing,
and
in
those
pages
of
the
record
between
48
and
52,
the
trial
judge
said,
“i'm
going
to
allow
the
defendant
to
make
his
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
and
i'm
going
to
allow
him
to
include
this
affirmative
defense
as
a
ground
of
that
motion.”
my
point
quickly
is
this,
may
it
please
this
court,
that
the
issue
was
paramount
throughout
the
trial
from
the
outset
to
the
end.
there
was
no
motion
made
by
the
plaintiff
to
strike
his
admission
with
respect
to
this
defense.
there
was
no
motion
made
by
this
plaintiff
to
strike
the
testimony
that
had
been
presented
throughout
the
trial
with
regard
to
this
defense.
certainly,
the
district
judge,
the
trial
judge
when
he
said,
“i'm
going
to
keep
the
matter
open.”
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
he
admitted
the
detail
in
that
respect.
but
there
was
that
testimony
and
no
testimony
offered
to
rebut.
that
would
come
directly
under
support
that
i
make
here,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
correct,
sir.
yes,
sir.
the
evidence
was
in
the
record.
there
was
no
motion
to
strike
it.
it
was
there.
the
plaintiff
was
confronted
with
it
and
it
was
uncontradicted.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
feel
certain
that
the
evidence
would
have
remained
the
same.
it
could
not
have
been
contradicted.
those
facts
are
there.
they
could
not
be
contradicted,
but
he
had
the
opportunity.
the
plaintiff
had
the
occasion.
he
was
advised,
he
was
notified,
he
was
warned.
he
elected
to
make
his
motion
at
the
time
that
he
did
and
the
court
specifically
held
the
matter
open.
and
then,
at
the
conclusion,
the
court
had
undertook.
the
court
listened
to
the
arguments.
this
matter
on
the
motion
for
directed
verdict
was
fully
argued.
i
argued
it
to
the
best
of
my
capacity
and
then
at
the
conclusion
of
it,
the
judge
ruled
upon
the
motion.
but
the
judge
expressly
allowed
our
rights
to
be
reserved.
he
granted
us
an
exception
with
respect
to
the
plaintiff's
motion
to
dismiss
the
affirmative
defense.
and
when
this
matter
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
below,
i
wish
to
point
out
here
that
go
back
to
the
trial
and
with
regard
to
the
trial
judge
allowing
this
matter
to
be
kept
open,
allowing
this
affirmative
defense
to
be
a
part
of
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
the
plaintiff
did
not
take
exception.
the
plaintiff
made
no
objection.
he
sets
out.
if
he
had
any
objection
to
what
the
trial
judge
was
doing
at
the
time
of
making
his
ruling,
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
in
the
trial
court
to
exercise
his
objection
at
that
time
and
to
say
so.
now,
to
go
one
step
further,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioner
here
has
never
complained
of
the
trial
judge
allowing
us,
the
respondent,
to
keep
and
to
tell
that
part
of
our
motion
in
our
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
he
could
have
made
some
objection
or
he
could
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
--
have
taken
exception,
sir,
but
he
did
neither.
the
petitioner
is
here
complaining
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
the
right
of
a
jury
trial
under
the
seventh
amendment.
that
is
the
petitioner's
complaint
here
in
this
honorable
court.
and
we
submit
most
respectfully,
the
petitioner
here
has
not
been
deprived
of
any
right
of
jury
trial.
this
question
of
the
compensation
act,
this
question
of
the
south
carolina
act,
the
south
carolina
law,
it
was
strictly
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
it
was
a
matter
of
law
for
the
court
to
decide
and
that
had
been
determined
in
this
case
from
the
outset
on
the
plaintiff
--
his
own
motion.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
we
say,
sir,
that
it
is
a
matter
of
substantive
law
of
south
carolina.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
issue.
the
--
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
is
not
a
matter
that
can
be
tried
by
men
of
the
jury,
men
not
trained
in
the
law.
it
is
a
matter
that
must
be
decided
by
the
court.
it
is
an
issue
of
law.in
that
respect,
i
wish
to
refer
to
our
brief
again
where
we
cited
the
guaranty
trust
case.
and
we
think
that
here,
it
applies.
here
is
erie
versus
tompkins
as
applied
to
our
case
and
if
i
may
to
read
the
quote
from
our
brief
with
respect
to
erie
versus
tompkins
and
then
to
apply
here.
this
court
said
erie
versus
tompkins
was
not
an
endeavor
to
formulate
scientific
legal
terminology.
it
expressed
a
policy
that
touches
vitally
the
proper
distribution
of
judicial
power
between
state
and
federal
courts.
in
essence,
the
intent
of
that
decision
was
to
insure
that
in
all
cases
where
a
federal
court
is
exercising
jurisdiction
solely
because
of
the
diversity
of
citizenship
of
the
parties
and
certainly
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
the
federal
court
was
exercised
solely
because
of
the
diversity
of
citizenship
of
the
parties
and
the
jurisdictional
amount
involved.
and
going
on,
the
court
--
this
court
said
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
in
the
federal
court
should
be
substantially
the
same,
so
far
as
legal
rules
determine
the
outcome
of
a
litigation
as
it
would
be
if
tried
in
a
state
court.
the
nub
of
the
policy
that
underlies
erie
versus
tompkins
is
that
for
the
same
transaction,
the
accident
of
a
suit
by
a
non-resident
litigant
in
a
federal
court
instead
of
a
state
court,
a
block
away
should
not
lead
to
a
substantially
different
result.
and
concluding
plainly
enough,
a
statute
that
would
completely
bar
recovery
in
a
suit
if
brought
in
a
state
court
bears
only
state-created
right.
we
say
it
bears
upon
the
substantive
law
of
the
state
as
created
by
our
statute.
it
bears
on
a
state-created
right
vitally
and
not
merely
formally
or
negligibly
as
to
consequences
that
so
intimately
affect
recovery
or
non-recovery
a
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case
should
follow
state
law.
thank
you
for
your
courtesy.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
by
the
court.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
may
i
go
in
just
a
slight
more
detail
there,
sir?
if
the
claim
is
brought
before
the
industrial
commission,
then
the
industrial
commission
will,
of
course,
make
the
first
determination
as
to
jurisdiction.
but
under
our
south
carolina
compensation
act,
that
is
the
one
factual
matter
that
is
reviewable
by
the
court
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
our
state.
and
adams
versus
davison-paxon
and
the
line
of
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
have
held
time
and
again
that
it
is
a
matter
of
law
for
the
court
to
decide,
it
is
the
matter
of
jurisdiction,
sir.
thank
you
for
your
courtesy.
