may

please

your

this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
certiorari
granted
to
review
to
decision
of
the
court
below.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
reversed
a
district
court
judgment
entered
upon
a
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
remanded
it
with
directions
to
enter
judgment
for
the
respondent
company
on
the
ground
of
its
affirmative
defense
and
then
reversed
it.
the
court
below
held
that
the
evidence
based
solely
upon
the
testimony
of
the
managing
agent
of
the
respondent
company
even
though
changed,
corrected,
recanted,
repudiated
by
the
witness
on
the
stand
prior
to
the
completion
of
his
examination,
had
probative
value
and
was
thus
legally
sufficient
to
establish
affirmative
defense.
and
in
remand,
the
court
went
even
further
and
held
that
since
this
testimony
had
not
been
controverted
by
required
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
the
evidence
was
not
only
legal,
its
sufficient
but
did
as
a
matter
of
law
conclusively
established
respondent's
affirmative
defense
and
warranted
a
directed
verdict
in
favor
of
respondents.
and
thus
in
remanding
the
directed
entry
of
judgment
for
the
respondent
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
affirmative
defense
had
been
dismissed
prior
to
petitioner's
case
and
reply,
so
that
petitioner
had
no
occasion
to
offer
reply
testimony.
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
if
there
were
directions
for
new
trial,
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
evidence
was
legally
insufficient
to
sustain
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct,
sir.
the
questions
thus
presented
to
this
court
are
first,
whether
a
federal
appellate
court
may
reverse
the
ruling
of
a
district
judge,
dismissing
an
affirmative
defense
for
want
of
substantial
evidence
where
the
evidence
produced
in
support
of
the
affirmative
defense
is
legally
insufficient
to
sustain
the
owners
proof,
impose
upon
a
defendant
according
to
the
standard
applied
by
this
court
and
the
applicable
state
court
in
testing
the
legal
sufficiency
of
one's
evidence.
and
secondly,
assuming
that
the
trial
judge
committed
reversible
errands,
missing
the
affirmative
defense,
does
a
federal
appellate
court
have
the
right
in
reversing
to
direct
entry
of
judgment
for
a
respond
--
on
this
issue
where
the
evidence
produced
in
support
of
the
affirmative
defense
is
subject
to
conflicting
inferences
and
conclusion
and
depends
upon
witnesses
whose
credibility
is
placed
in
issue.
or
under
circumstances
where
because
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
judge
declared
erroneous,
a
plaintiff
has
no
opportunity
or
occasion
at
the
trial
of
the
case
to
dispute
or
controvert
the
facts
on
the
issue
of
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
sir.
he
was
asked
if
there
was
--
if
he
was
going
to
put
in
proof
and
the
counsel
stated
to
the
court
that
we
are
asking
now
for
dismissal
of
the
affirmative
defense
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
because
if
the
evidence
is
not
legally
sufficient,
we
see
no
occasion
to
put
in
any
proof
and
the
court
and
the
district
judge
did
dismiss
the
affirmative
defense
after
which
he
was
asked
if
had
any
reply
testimony.
and
of
course,
the
issue
having
gone
--
having
gone
out
of
the
case,
no
reply
testimony
on
that
issue
was
offered.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
no.
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
sir.
our
position
--
our
position
is
that
if
the
evidence
is
not
legally
sufficient
at
the
conclusion
of
the
respondent's
affirmative
presentation
of
its
testimony,
we
have
a
right
to
ask
for
dismissal
so
that
we
wouldn't
be
burdened
with
proceedings
with
the
trial
any
further
to
controvert
any
evidence
which
is
not
legally
sufficient.
i
think
that's
in
the
spirit
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
is
to
grant
a
speedy
and
inexpensive
determination
of
every
proceedings.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
that's
the
same
position
that
the
defendant
has
put
in
when
he
makes
the
motion
for
directed
verdict
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
and
if
it's
sustained
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
decide
that
it
should
not
have
been
sustained,
he
comes
back
and
he's
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
the
foot
is
now
--
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot
now.
now,
the
plaintiff
is
making
that
motion
before
his
case
in
reply.
and
if
the
defendant
had
made
a
motion
before
its
case
in
defense,
he
certainly
would
have
a
right
to
a
new
trial.
if
he
was
successful
in
the
district
court
and
unsuccessful
in
the
reviewing
court,
that's
our
position,
sir.
same
right
they
have,
we
have,
plaintiff
and
defendant
have
equal
rights.
the
important
facts
in
this
case
briefly
are
these,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
it
resolves
the
south
--
south
carolina
law,
as
well
as
the
applicable
standard
apply
in
a
federal
court
in
testing
the
legal
sufficiency
of
one's
evidence.
there's
a
combination
of
south
carolina
law
as
well
as
the
applicable
standard
apply
in
a
federal
court
in
testing
a
legal
sufficiency
of
one's
evidence.
mr.
henry
hammer
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
it
was
one
of
fact
if
the
evidence
was
legally
sufficient.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
it's
one
of
fact.
now,
i
might
go
a
little
bit
further,
its
one
of
statutory
construction,
too.
and
i
might
take
this
point
up
to
this
time.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
it's
--
the
statute
--
we
must
consider
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
enacted
and
it
was
enacted
for
the
protection
of
employees
of
independent
contractors
who
are
not
otherwise
entitled
to
benefits
under
law
which
requires
their
immediate
employer.
mr.
henry
hammer
thank
you,
sir.
answering
your
last
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
evidence
was
not
only
legally
sufficient
to
sustain
the
owner's
proof
and
pose
upon
the
defendant
according
to
the
standards
applied
by
both
this
court
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
henry
hammer
legally
insufficient,
but
also
that
the
dismissal
of
the
affirmative
defense
find
support
on
another
ground
and
probably
distinct
and
apart
from
the
legal
insufficiency
of
the
others.
for
this
reason,
in
respondent's
answer,
it
is
alleged
that
the
petitioner's
employer
of
bouligny
construction
company
was
operating
under
the
requirements
of
the
south
carolina
workmen's
compensation
act
as
distinguished
from
a
voluntary
election
on
his
part
to
operate
under
the
act.
and
under
such
circumstances,
we
submit
that
section
72-111
of
the
south
carolina
workmen's
compensation
act
which
they
seek
to
invoke
now
as
a
basic
defense,
the
petitioner's
cause
of
action,
never
became
operative
because
the
statute
was
never
intended
to
and
never
did
create
any
legal
liability
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
to
provide
workmen's
compensation
coverage
for
the
petitioner
herein.
the
statute
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
those
circumstances
where
for
the
protection
of
employees
who
are
not
otherwise
entitled
to
workmen's
compensation
benefits
by
law
which
requires
their
immediate
employers
to
provide
workmen's
compensation
benefits
for
them.
mr.
henry
hammer
in
what
--
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
and
it's
very
important.
i
express
this
that
the
immediate
employer
didn't
come
under
the
act
voluntarily.
he
was
required
to
come
within
the
operation
of
the
statute.
and
as
stated
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
recent
case
of
adams
versus
davison-paxon
company
and
i
quote
from
page
12
on
--
in
petitioner's
reply
brief,
"the
courts
said
that
the
act
was
intended
to
apply,
to
extend
the
benefits
of
workmen's
compensation
to
workmen
who
otherwise
would
not
be
entitled
to
that."
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
it
was
--
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
we
didn't
raise
the
question
in
the
district
court.
but
i
call
to
the
court's
attention,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
question
but
i
call
to
the
court
--
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
page
2
of
the
record
where
the
court
stated,
district
judge
stated
as
i
started
out
to
say
in
the
very
beginning
what
you
are
doing
now,
you
are
moving
that
they
not
be
allowed
to
read
that
defense
before
the
jury
because
--
because
it
is
a
legal
offense."
mr.
henry
hammer
page
2
of
the
transcript.
page
2
of
the
transcript
of
record.
the
court
stated,
"that
--
purely
a
question
of
law,
it
must
be
decided
on
legal
grounds.
is
that
what
you're
moving
for?”
my
answer
was,
“that's
the
first
motion.
and
secondly,
in
the
event
they
allowed
to
read
it,
they
should
read
only
those
portions
of
the
answer
which
are
material
and
would
not
permit
prejudicial
matter
to
come
into
the
case.”
so
we
did
raise
the
question
in
the
district
court.
moreover,
in
petitioner's
brief,
answer
in
the
brief,
they
stated
that
the
motion
was
made
to
amend
the
answer,
to
include
this
affirmative
defense
some
several
weeks
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
although
this
case
had
been
pending
for
quite
sometime
and
we
objected
to
the
amendment
of
this
answer,
and
stated
on
page
7
of
petitioners
brief
that
the
petitioner
moved
to
strike
the
defense.
and
at
--
at
approximately
the
same
time
the
respondent
entered
a
motion
to
amend
the
allegations.
and
of
course
the
motion
was
granted
by
the
district
judge
permitting
the
amendment.
although
the
district
judge
didn't
dismiss
the
case
on
that
ground
we
raised
the
question
in
the
district
court.
we
also
posed
the
question
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
decided
the
question.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
question
adversely
to
the
petitioner.
but
we
contend,
as
stated
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
that
this
act
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
those
workmen
who
are
otherwise
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
act.
the
--
otherwise,
it
would
be
useless
to
legislation.
why
would
the
legislature
provide
a
double
protection
to
employees
of
independent
contractor?
mr.
henry
hammer
that
case
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
had
--
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
a
--
that
case
very
definitely
and
unequivocally
in
my
mind
suggest
that
the
affirmative
defense
is
not
proper,
not
legally
--
doesn't
constitute
a
legal
defense.
mr.
henry
hammer
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
pretty
adamant
about
the
decision
on
that
point
and
they
very
definitely
stated
that
the
--
our
contention
was
hopefully
without
merit
and
i
think
this
court
should
decide
it.
i
have
no
question
about
the
fact
that
this
court
should
decide
it.
mr.
henry
hammer
we
did
that
in
a
petition
for
a
rehearing.
we
had
no
idea
that
the
court
would
go
as
far
as
it
did
and
then
when
we
first
learned
of
the
situation
--
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
petition
for
rehearing
is
part
of
the
appendix,
a
part
of
the
transcripts
of
records.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
it's
cited
at
the
--
the
pertinent
language
is
cited
on
page
12
of
the
reply
brief
for
petitioner,
that's
the
blue
brief.
but
i
submit
this,
the
whole
otherwise,
this
statute,
this
section
would
extend
the
application
of
the
act
beyond
its
clear
and
expressed
purpose
and
it
would
serve
not
for
the
protection
of
the
employees
but
would
serve
for
the
protection
of
owners
to
the
detriment
of
the
employees
and
would
permit
owners
to
absolve
themselves
from
liability
because
under
circumstances
where
no
possible
valid
reason
exist
for
such
immunity.
we
submit
on
that
ground
the
affirmative
defense
should
have
been
dismissed.
now,
adverting
now
to
the
factual
questions
in
this
case
for
the
lack
of
evidence
to
support,
even
the
theory
of
defense
pursued
by
the
respondent,
it
appears
that
the
petitioner
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
western
district
of
south
carolina
against
respondent
blue
ridge
rural
electric
cooperative
by
and
ca
south
carolina
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
supplying
electricity
to
recover
damages
for
its
negligence
in
causing
and
permitting
electric
current
to
run
into
a
substation.
in
the
process
of
construction
an
uncompleted
steel
structures,
steel
and
concrete
structure,
in
the
process
of
construction
upon
which
the
petitioner
byrd
was
working,
resulting
in
the
lost
and
amputation
of
the
forearms
of
the
petitioner
who
incidentally
at
that
time
was
24
years
of
age,
married,
father
of
two
children,
and
had
an
earning
capacity
of
approximately
$5000
per
year.
at
the
time
of
his
injuries,
this
petitioner
was
working
as
an
employee
of
bouligny
construction
company,
an
independent
contracting
construction
firm,
a
cooperation
of
north
carolina
which
was
engaged
on
a
written
contract
to
construct
a
large
project
in
south
carolina
including
the
substation
involved
herein
at
a
cost
to
respondent
of
approximately
$334,000.
and
on
the
project,
they
employed
approximately
50
men.
and
as
i've
stated,
the
respondent,
several
weeks
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
case,
amended
it's
affirmative
defense
to
allege
that
the
work
of
constructing
substations
being
performed
by
the
independent
contractor
was
part
of
the
respondent's
business
and
hence
it
alleged
that
under
section
72-111
of
the
workmen's
compensation
act
department
provision
involved
herein,
the
petitioner
could
have
brought
an
action.
under
the
compensation
act
to
recover
benefits
and
therefore
his
present
action
at
common-law
was
bought.
and
in
order
to
establish
this
defense,
the
respondent
sought
to
establish
this
defense
solely
by
evidence.
that
is
direct
employees
ordinarily
and
appropriately
performed
the
work
of
constructing
substations.
and
it
sought
to
establish
this
evidence
by
the
sole
testimony
of
respondent's
manager,
a.j.
(inaudible)
who
on
depositions
prior
to
trial
professed
to
have
little,
if
any,
knowledge
concerning
the
work
performed
by
the
employees
of
the
respondent
company
or
the
nature
of
the
work
involved
in
the
construction
of
a
substation.
notwithstanding,
at
the
trial
of
his
case,
he
took
the
stand
and
testified
on
direct
examination
unequivocally
that
the
respondent
had
six
substations
and
constructed
with
its
own
employees
and
facilities
three
of
the
substations
and
that
the
last
of
these
three
substations
was
constructed
at
liberty,
south
carolina
three
years
prior
to
petitioner's
injuries
with
respondents
direct
employees
and
facilities.
however,
the
following
day
when
he
was
recalled
to
the
stand
for
further
cross-examination
and
confronted
with
telegraphic
--
confronted
with
telegrams
from
independent
contractors
who
had
actually
constructed
subs
--
the
substations
which
he
was
talking
about.
he
changed,
corrected,
recanted,
and
repudiated
his
testimony
of
the
prior
day
by
stating
that
the
respondent
did
not
construct
with
its
own
facilities
and
employees
the
substation
built
at
liberty,
south
carolina
three
years
prior
for
petitioner's
injuries
and
finally
admitted
that
the
respondent
didn't
construct
with
its
own
employees
and
facilities
any
of
its
substations.
other
than
this
testimony
the
record
is
void
of
evidence
that
the
respondent's
direct
employees
performed
such
work
to
support
respondent's
theory
of
defense.
moreover,
as
pointed
out
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
miles
versus
west
virginia
pulp
and
paper
company
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
the
application
of
this
section
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
work
being
performed
by
the
independent
contractor
be
owned
by
the
owner
at
the
time
of
the
employee's
injuries.
in
the
instant
case,
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
substation
was
neither
owned,
possessed,
nor
controlled,
nor
in
use,
nor
in
operation
as
an
integral
part
of
respondent's
business
at
the
time
of
the
petitioner's
injuries.
therefore,
adverting
to
our
first
question
involved
--
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
the
very
instrumentality,
the
substation
was
neither
owned,
possessed,
nor
controlled
by
the
respondent.
it
would,
under
the
contract,
awarded
to
the
independent
contractor
he
had
exclusive
possession
and
control
of
the
work
subject
of
course
to
the
inspection,
test
and
approval
by
another
independent
contractor,
not
an
independent
contracting
engineering
firm
which
supervised
the
work.
mr.
henry
hammer
on
their
premises,
yes
sir,
on
the
premises.
we
submit
therefore
that
according
to
our
first
question
involved
that
the
reversal
by
the
court
below
was
clearly
erroneous
and
we
rest
our
contention
upon
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
galloway
versus
united
states,
319
u.s.
372
where
in
this
court
at
pages
379
and
380,
in
testing
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
a
party
having
the
burden
of
proof,
applied
the
standard
of
refusing
to
give
legal
efficacy
or
probative
value
to
the
testimony
of
a
witness
who
changes,
corrects,
recants
and
repudiates
his
testimony
on
the
witness
stand.
a
standard
which
has
been
followed
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
line
of
decisions
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
had
forward
spaces
that
properly
and
only
administration
of
justice
to
discourage
the
giving
of
false
testimony.
we
also
rely
upon
the
principle
enunciated
on
a
principle
flowing
from
the
application
of
this
standard
as
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
galloway
case
and
i
quote,
"that
mere
speculation
may
not
be
allowed
to
do
duly
for
probative
facts
after
making
due
allowance
for
all
--
all
reasonably
possible
emphasis
favoring
a
party
whose
case
is
attacked."
and
judged
by
the
foregoing
standard
and
the
principle
flowing
from
the
application
of
this
standards,
we
submit
that
there's
no
substantial
evidence
of
record
in
this
case
upon
which
a
finding
of
favor
of
respondent's
affirmative
defense
can
be
based
upon
the
theory
of
the
defense
pursued
by
the
respondent
in
the
court
below.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
in
the
adams
case,
the
court
very
purportedly
said,
"the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
extend
the
benefits
of
workmen's
compensation
to
workmen
who
otherwise
would
not
be
entitled
to
them
by
law."
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
now,
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
and
i
want
to
make
myself
clear
that
if
the
independent
contractor
had
kept
--
come
into
the
act
voluntarily,
of
course
this
section
would
apply
provided
the
other
provisions
would
have
to
fall,
under
the
adams
case.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
hammer
exactly.
mr.
henry
hammer
appears
in
the
answer
filed
in
the
court
below
in
the
district
court,
paragraph
six,
page
b
of
the
transcript
of
record
which
says
--
mr.
henry
hammer
page
b.
got
a
small
"b"
on
the
top
of
the
transcript
of
record.
and
it
states
there
that
the
defendant
alleges
that
the
said
r.h.
bouligny,
inc.
was
operating
under
the
requirements
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
and
provision
of
the
south
--
mr.
henry
hammer
pardon
sir?
mr.
henry
hammer
we
contended
sir,
that
that
statement
should
not
be
read
to
the
jury
because
it
would
prejudice
the
case
of
the
plaintiff
in
permitting
collateral
evidence
of
compensation
to
come
into
the
case
and
if
they
put
--
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
it
wasn't
stricken.
we
admit
that
--
mr.
henry
hammer
that
was
not
read
to
the
jury.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
the
evidence
also
shows
they
had
40
or
50
employees
which
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
but
there
is
a
document
which
states
that.
mr.
henry
hammer
bouligny.
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
nothing
was
stated
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes
sir.
and
i
want
to
call
the
court's
--
the
court's
--
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
bouligny
had
elected
to
come
in,
not
--
you
read
on
page
c
of
the
transcript
of
record,
paragraph
7,
and
there
the
distinguishing
feature
that
bouligny,
the
respondent
had
elected
to
come
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
mean
--
excuse
me,
blue
ridge.
mr.
henry
hammer
blue
ridge.
mr.
henry
hammer
correct.
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes.
yes,
sir.
i
do
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
testimony
where
this
witness
(inaudible)
did
change
his
testimony
given
on
direct.
and
on
page
38,
the
witness
was
specifically
asked
on
cross-examination,
“how
long
prior
to
the
construction
of
this
substation
that
mr.
byrd
got
his
arm
spurned
off
on?”
“has
been
since
the
substation
had
been
constructed
in
behalf
of
the
blue
ridge
off
by
that?”
answer
-
“approximately
three
years.”
and
he
state
that
was
at
liberty,
south
carolina.
“who
build
that?”
he
said
-
“we
built
that,
sir.
we
did,
sir.”
again,
he
was
asked,
“did
you
build
that?”
he
says,
“yes,
sir.”
“three
years
before?”
“yes,
sir.”
then
on
page
42
of
the
record,
his
final
examination,
the
question
was
asked
them,
“and
the
substation
at
liberty
was
built
by
who?”
answer
--
the
one
--
“there
are
now,
sir,
i
don't
know
who
built
that
offhand,
sir.”
“you
don't
know
who
built
your
substation
at
liberty?”
“no,
not
right
now.
i
do
not,
sir.”
question
-
“would
it
refresh
your
recollection
the
name
samta
builders?
do
you
recall
now
that
they
built
that
substation?”
answer
-
“since
you
mentioned
it,
they
did
some
work
for
us,
sir.”
question
-
“i
didn't
ask
you
that."
i
said,
"didn't
they
build
your
substation
at
liberty?
you
don't
know
whether
they
did
or
not?”
answer
-
“i
would
say,
they
did,
yes,
sir.”
then,
when
he
was
equivocating,
the
final
question
was
put
to
him.
“you
didn't
build
any
of
the
substations
that
you're
operating
now.”
the
answer
was,
“no,
sir,
we
--
no,
sir.”
that
was
a
final
retraction
of
all
his
previous
testimony
by
which
--
by
which
they
sought
to
sustain
their
affirmative
defense
and
we
submit
that
left
the
record
with
no
evidence
upon
which
the
affirmative
defense
can
be
sustained
on
a
theory
of
proof
which
they
presume.
and
so
far
as
the
witness
mr.
(inaudible),
significantly
enough,
he
did
not
testify
that
the
employees
of
the
respondent
company
built
any
substations
and
i
call
your
attention
to
that,
to
his
testimony.
it
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
hammer
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
with
reference
to
the
testimony
of
the
respondent's
managing
agent,
(inaudible),
we
submit
that
if
that
testimony
can
be
treated
as
some
evidence
that
the
respondent's
direct
employees
at
some
time
perform
the
activity
of
building
substations,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
at
the
time
the
petitioner
lost
both
his
arms
and
for
a
long
time
prior
to
thereto,
the
respondent
was
not
engaged
in
this
activity
if
indeed
if
ever
was
engaged
in
such
activities.
and
in
this
connection,
with
reference
to
a
question
asked
of
me
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
to
whether
the
nature
of
the
work
at
the
time
of
injury
controls,
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
case
of
gordon
versus
hollywood-beaufort
package
corporation,
213
s.c.438
--
mr.
henry
hammer
no,
sir.
that
was
--
mr.
henry
hammer
213
s.c.438.
mr.
henry
hammer
or
in
49
s.e.2d
718
in
which
this
court
--
in
which
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
the
type
of
activity
performed
at
the
time
of
the
petitioner's
injuries
by
the
owner
controls
in
determining
whether
the
work
comes
within
the
act
or
if
excluded
from
the
act.
mr.
henry
hammer
the
type
of
work
that
is
being
performed
by
the
employer,
the
employer's
activities.
in
that
case,
if
your
honors
please,
it
appeared
that
a
claim
was
brought
against
the
defendant,
hollywood-beaufort
package
corporation,
for
workmen's
compensation
benefits.
and
it
also
appeared
that
sometime
prior
to
the
petitioner's
injuries,
the
employer
was
engaged
in
manufacturing
rotary
veneer
which
was
used
in
its
principal
business
of
also
manufacturing
shipping
containers.
and
under
the
south
carolina
statute
where
an
employer
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
shipping
containers
principally,
he
is
exempt
from
the
application
of
the
act.
sometime
previous
to
the
petitioner's
injuries,
this
employer
gave
up
its
operations
of
manufacturing
shipping
containers
but
retained
that
part
of
the
operation
of
producing
rotary
veneer
which
was
placed
or
used
for
the
manufacture
of
shipping
containers.
the
petitioner
or
the
claimant
sustained
an
injury
at
that
time
at
some
time
subsequent
thereto
and
the
employer
sought
to
deny
liability
of
its
responsibility
for
payment
of
workmen's
compensation
benefits
under
the
act
on
the
ground
that
it
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
shipping
containers
principally
and
therefore,
under
the
provisions
of
the
act,
it
was
exempt.
and
the
court
very
empathically
held
in
that
case
that
the
only
question
presented
therefore
is
whether
or
not,
and
i
quote,
“at
the
time
of
the
injury
and
death
of
john
gordon,
the
appellant,
was
subject
to
and
bound
by
the
provisions
of
the
south
carolina
workmen's
compensation
act.”
and
the
court
held
that
since
it
had
no
facilities
to
engage
in
the
manufacturing
of
shipping
containers,
which
it
previously
had
and
had
given
up
those
facilities,
the
court
held
that
the
employer
was
bound
by
the
provisions
of
the
south
carolina
workmen's
compensations
act.
of
course,
the
situation
in
that
case
is
converse
from
the
situation
in
this
case
because
in
this
case,
we
submit,
that
if
the
respondent,
blue
ridge,
had
any
time
been
engaged
in
such
business
of
manufacturing
substations,
the
evidence
is
totally
clear
in
this
case
that
it
had
not
performed
such
activity
for
a
long
time
prior
to
petitioner's
interest.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
mr.
justice
whittaker,
we
absolutely
do
dispute
that
fact
because
we
took
a
deposition
prior
to
trial
of
a
witness
which
we
had
planned
to
put
up
in
the
event
our
motion
would
have
been
denied,
showing
that
they
only
had
three
lines
in
their
employee
and
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
construction
of
substations.
mr.
henry
hammer
we
certainly
deny
that
too,
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
transmission
--
the
construction
of
transmission
lines.
the
only
work
that
they
have
to
do
was
the
work
of
connecting
or
putting
connecting
lines
from
its
existing
lines
to
the
homes
of
consumers
in
order
to
make
service
connections.
mr.
henry
hammer
well,
we
can't
--
we
cannot
deny
it
right
now.
but
that's
the
only
evidence
they
had
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
well,
under
those
circumstances
i
stated,
in
response
to
your
honor's
question
yesterday,
it
must
appear
that
the
whole
of
the
work
of
the
independent
contractor
being
performed
for
the
respondent
here
was
part
or
the
whole
of
the
respondent's
business.
the
mere
fact
is
that
a
small
activity
performed
by
the
independent
contractor
would
be
the
same
type
of
activity
performed
by
the
respondent,
blue
ridge,
would
not
make
the
work
of
the
independent
contractor
the
trade,
business,
or
occupation
of
the
owner
because
we
many
times
have
those
situations
where
a
classic
example
is
where,
as
i
stated
yesterday,
the
driving
of
a
nail
into
the
wall
may
be
performed
by
a
large
building
contractor
and
that
same
work
might
be
performed
by
a
--
outfit
like
sears
roebuck
and
company
where
they
have
maintenance
men
who
drive
a
nail
in
the
wall
to
keep
the
wall
in
repair.
but
that
would
not
mean
that
the
work
of
the
independent
contractor,
the
trade,
business
or
occupation
of
the
owner.
i
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
previous
case
of
sears
roebuck
versus
wallace
cited
in
the
brief
clearly
enunciated
the
controlling
principles
but
did
not
apply
them
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
hammer
this
contract,
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain,
does
not
require
that
particular
one.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
might
answer
the
question
this
way
that
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
call
for
or
does
not
but
if
it
does
call
for
it,
my
position
is
that
that,
in
itself,
would
not
make
the
work
of
the
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
don't
recall
that
because
the
theory
of
the
--
of
the
respondent's
case
as
stated
in
its
answer
on
page
--
mr.
henry
hammer
portions
of
the
contract
is
in
the
record.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
do
not
believe
it
includes
all
of
the
work.
but
if
your
honor
please,
if
you'll
refer
to
page
c
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
--
mr.
henry
hammer
page
c,
marked
small
“c”.
it
will
appear
therefrom
that
the
defense
was
limited
to
the
fact
that
this
work
included
the
construction
of
a
substation
and
that
the
construction
of
the
substation
by
bouligny
was
part
of
the
trade
business
and
occupation.
that
was
the
theory
of
their
defense.
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
that's
our
definite
--
mr.
henry
hammer
--
position
that
they
never
constructed
substations,
never
had
anything
to
do
with
substations.
in
fact,
the
respondent's
own
managing
agent
on
deposition
prior
to
trial
stated
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
new
construction.
mr.
henry
hammer
first
of
all,
if
your
honors
please,
we
can
show
that
they
never
constructed
a
substation.
mr.
henry
hammer
pardon,
sir?
mr.
henry
hammer
we
--
we
thought
we
had
proved
it
by
the
testimony
of
(inaudible)
who
changed,
corrected,
recanted
that
and
repudiated
his
testimony
and
--
mr.
henry
hammer
--
we
felt
that
in
view
of
that
retraction
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
record
upon
which
a
finding
of
favorable
response
affirmative
defense
could
have
been
supported.
and
the
judge
sustained
our
position
and
in
the
orderly
process
of
a
trial,
we
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
nor
incumbent
upon
us
having
--
have
the
affirmative
defense
dismissed
to
go
ahead
and
proceed.
mr.
henry
hammer
i
did
and
i
said
that
i
--
mr.
henry
hammer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
this
is
the
same
position
that
we're
in,
that
a
defendant
is
in
when
he
makes
a
motion
for
an
involuntary
dismissal
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
he
had
the
same
opportunity
to
present
testimony
and
merely
if
he's
successful
in
the
lower
court
and
reversed
in
the
upper
court,
it
does
not
mean
that
he
--
mr.
henry
hammer
that
was
--
mr.
henry
hammer
the
--
mr.
henry
hammer
if
he's
correct.
mr.
henry
hammer
but
--
mr.
henry
hammer
--
in
his
opinion,
if
your
honor
please,
he
also
based
his
decision
upon
the
fact
that
the
employees
had
engaged
in
constructing
three
substations
and
that
they
were
engaged
in
another
and
separate
distinct
business
of
--
mr.
henry
hammer
we
--
mr.
henry
hammer
we
would
--
we
would
--
mr.
henry
hammer
we
would
certainly
show,
if
the
court
please,
by
expert
testimony
that
this
is
not
the
trade,
business
or
occupation
of
a
rural
electric
cooperative
if
we
had
that
opportunity
at
the
trial
and
if
our
motion
had
been
denied
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
henry
hammer
mr.
justice
--
mr.
henry
hammer
well,
i
perhaps
used
an
incorrect
word
but
nevertheless,
our
position
was
the
same
as
the
position
of
any
defendant
who
moves
for
an
involuntary
dismissal
as
against
a
person
having
the
burden
of
proof.
and
a
burden
of
proof
is
--
it
must
be
remembered
in
this
case,
was
imposed
upon
the
respondent
blue
ridge.
mr.
henry
hammer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
may
call
your
attention
to
the
transcript
at
page
48,
he
asked
me,
"in
the
event
of,"
--
and
i
read
from
the
transcript
of
the
court,
“in
the
event
i
overruled
your
motion,
do
you
contemplate
putting
up
any
testimony
in
reply?
you
have
that
right
of
course
on
this
point,
i
mean.”
my
answer
was
this,
“we
haven't
discussed
it
that
we
are
making
that
motion.
i
frankly
don't
know
at
this
point
of
any
reply
that
is
necessary.
i
don't
know
of
any
evidence
in
this
case.”
now,
as
--
i
was
about
to
say
that
would
be
necessary
and,
of
course,
i
was
interrupted
and
then
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
court
and
mr.
walker.
and
then,
i
stated
to
the
court,
"we
are
moving
at
this
time
in
the
nature
of
an,"
--
it
says
voluntary
dismissal,
i
believe
that's
now
in
printing,
involuntary
dismissal.
and
the
court
says,
“you
move
to
dismiss
the
defense?"
"yes,
sir,
at
this
stage
of
this
game.”
then
he
asked,
"mr.
walker,
what
do
you
say?”
and
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
court.
and
after
that,
the
court
very
properly
so
overruled
rather
dismissed
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
henry
hammer
the
court
went
that
far.
mr.
henry
hammer
well,
i
interpreted
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that's
holding
it
on
several
grounds
and
this
--
mr.
henry
hammer
and
i
--
i
am
taking
up
each
of
the
ground,
but
i
--
i
didn't
want
to
be
precluded
as
to
any
particular
ground.
you
--
your
honor
stated
it
correctly.
that
was
an
additional
--
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
i
agree
--
mr.
henry
hammer
yes,
sir.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
in
our
argument,
the
respondent
contended
that
since
the
statute
under
which
it
was
organized
empowered
it
to
perform
the
work
that
the
independent
contractor,
bouligny,
was
performing,
this
was
proof
in
itself
that
the
respondent
was
engaged
in
the
construction
of
substations.
and
at
page
60
of
the
transcript,
the
court
in
reversing
apparently
placed
some
reliance
upon
this
contention
by
stating,
and
i
quote,
“there
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
of
the
work
is
covered
by
the
bouligny
contractor.”
it
was
of
a
class
which
blue
ridge
was
empowered
by
its
charter
to
perform.
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
contention
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
south
carolina
law.
and
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
vermillion
versus
woman's
college
of
due
west
reported
in
104
south
carolina,
in
which
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
corporation
organizes
or
obtains
a
charter
under
a
statute
providing
for
the
incorporation
of
eleemosynary
corporation
is
not,
of
itself,
sufficient
proof
that
such
corporation
is,
and
now,
eleemosynary
corporation
in
the
absence
of
evidence
as
to
its
actual
operations.
that's
the
holding
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
as
to
whether
proof
that
one
--
that
one
has
the
power
as
distinguished
from
the
exercise
of
that
power,
sir,
is
engaged
in
a
particular
business.
and
we
submit
that
if
respondent's
reasoning
and
the
court's
reasoning
below
has
followed
section
72-111
of
the
act
would
take
on
a
meaning
far
different
than
the
plain
wording
of
the
statutes.
it
would
extend
the
liability
of
owners
to
work
which
corporate
owners
have
the
power
to
perform
and
individual
owners
have
the
right
to
perform.
mr.
henry
hammer
that
was
--
that
was
one
of
the
questions
involved.
mr.
henry
hammer
it
was
a
--
an
operation
between
apparent
and
subsidiary
--
mr.
henry
hammer
and
this
--
mr.
henry
hammer
but,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said
also
that
even
though
you
were
supposed
to
liberally
construe
the
statute,
the
court,
and
i
refer
to
the
case
of
mcdowell
versus
stilley
plywood
company,
said
the
courts
are
--
and
i
quote,
“are
without
authority
to
enlarge
the
meaning
of
the
terms
used
by
the
legislature.”
mr.
henry
hammer
if
we
follow
that
construction,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
then
the
phrase
“trade,
business
or
occupation”
will
have
no
meaning.
owners
would
be
liable
for
the
injury
sustained
by
employees
of
independent
contractors
under
all
circumstances
save
the
exceptional
one
where
the
contract
with
the
independent
contract
by
a
corporate
owner
is
ultra
vires
or
the
contract
by
an
individual
with
the
independent
contract
is
prohibited
by
law.
mr.
henry
hammer
but
we
must
look
at
this
thing
in
context,
not
out
of
context.
we
must
look
at
the
interpretation
to
be
given
to
a
statute
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
enacted
and
what
was
the
purpose
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
employees
of
independent
contractors
who
are
not
otherwise
protected
by
law
and
to
prevent
employers
from
debating
responsibility
under
the
act
by
doing
to
--
through
independent
contractors
work
which
is
not
performed,
which
work
rather
which
is
ordinarily
performed
by
direct
employees.
none
of
--
mr.
henry
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
hammer
but
we
do
not
have
that
situation
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
henry
hammer
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
we
--
there
was
no
need
for
the
legislature
to
use
the
words
"trade,
business,
work"
which
is
part
of
the
trade,
business,
or
occupation.
we
can
say
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
say
we
should
give
greater
weight
to
the
district
judge
who
was
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
of
longstanding
who
had
sat
as
an
associate
--
mr.
henry
hammer
the
court
has
so
stated
in
mcallister
versus
united
states,
348
u.s.19,
that
the
court
sits
in
the
same
position
as
does
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
district
court's
finding.
mr.
henry
hammer
he
sat
as
an
associate
justice
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
he
served
for
a
long
time
as
a
member
of
the
south
carolina
legislature.
mr.
henry
hammer
they
were
not
even
lawyers
of
south
carolina.
and
we
have
another
decision
by
another
district
judge
of
south
carolina
in
the
ballard
case
wherein
the
judge
held
that
under
circumstances
such
as
existence
in
the
present
case,
the
workmen's
compensation
is
not
applicable
herein
and
the
very
eminent
judge.
mr.
henry
hammer
moore?
he's
from
west
virginia.
mr.
henry
hammer
and
--
mr.
henry
hammer
i
claim
immunity
as
mr.
justice
black
[laughter]
suggests.
mr.
henry
hammer
now,
i
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
we
should
give
due
weight
to
the
opinions
of
judges
who
sit
in
the
district
where
--
mr.
henry
hammer
with
all
due
--
mr.
henry
hammer
with
--
mr.
henry
hammer
with
all
due
deference
to
judge
soper
and
judge
parker,
whom
i
love
and
adore,
i
say
that
they
were
incorrect
in
seeking
to
interpret
this
statute
in
the
manner
they
did
because
they
opened
the
door
really
wide
and
removed
every
limitation
there
is
on
the
liability
of
an
owner
for
the
work
sustained
by
an
employee
of
an
independent
contractor
in
direct
conflict
to
the
expressed
language
of
the
statute
which
unequivocally
states
that
the
work
must
be
part
of
the
trade,
business
or
occupation.
mr.
henry
hammer
they'd
both
be
under
the
act,
but
that
involves
another
section,
section
70
--
mr.
henry
hammer
--
which
--
which
doesn't
require
that
the
work
be
part
of
the
trade,
business
or
occupation
of
the
owner.
mr.
henry
hammer
section
72-111
said
--
states
that
in
order
to
hold
an
owner
liable
--
mr.
henry
hammer
that
relates
to
a
--
independent
contractor
hiring
a
subcontractor.
that's
section
72-112.
this
one
relates
to
an
individual
or
corporate
owner
hiring
an
independent
contractor.
the
other
goes
a
step
down.
mr.
henry
hammer
language
is
entirely
different.
in
fact,
it
states
very
unequivocally
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
trade,
business
or
occupation
of
the
owner.
that
was
the
smith
versus
fulmer
case
cited
in
the
brief
thank
you,
sir.
