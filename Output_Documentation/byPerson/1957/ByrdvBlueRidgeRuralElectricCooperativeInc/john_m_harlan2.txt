justice
john
m.
harlan
wasn't
he
given
an
opportunity
to
put
in
proof.
you
--
you
have
said
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
good.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
put
it
--
put
it
in
other
way,
if
judge
soper
is
correct
as
to
the
south
carolina
law,
this
evidence
that
you're
referring
to
would
be
wholly
immaterial,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
he's
correct
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
i
have
said.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
he
--
he
says
flatly
in
his
opinion
that
that
consideration
is
an
irrelevant
consideration
under
the
south
carolina
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
couldn't
say
it
more
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
all
of
that
--
all
of
that
was
in
the
context
of
an
issue
of
a
theory
in
the
south
carolina
statute
which
the
court
of
appeals
since
held
to
be
wrong
because
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
from
the
fact
that
this
organization,
blue
ridge,
was
engaged
in
distributing
power,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
of
appeals
said
power
stations,
lines
were
part
of
the
business.
and
it
was
wholly
immaterial
whether
the
company
itself
had
ever
engaged
in
the
physical
construction
work
itself.
now,
you
say
that's
wrong
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
if
that's
right,
why,
all
of
this
discussion
is
wholly
irrelevant,
isn't
this,
to
whether
you
were
closed
off
or
whether
you
weren't?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
my
ground
--
if
my
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
correct,
and
that
it's
manifest,
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
haywire
on
south
carolina
law,
all
of
this
discussion
is
to
whether
you
were
thrown,
shutoff
or
not
is
immaterial,
you
agree
with
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
you'd
agree
with
it.
