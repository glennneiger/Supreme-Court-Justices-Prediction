justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
evidence
if
this
case
goes
back
to
this
trial?
what
evidence
you
--
would
you
now
want
to
offer
that
you
did
not
have
an
opportunity
of
offering
as
the
original
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
didn't
you
--
will
you
shut
off
from
showing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
have
no
opportunity
to
show
that
in
the
original
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
he
dismissed
it
he
asked
you
whether
you
had
anything
to
say
on
that
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
therefore
it
isn't
that
you
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
prove
something
that
you're
not
ready
to
prove,
you
had
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reversal
--
but
the
reversal
was
not
with
reference
to
that.
the
reversal
was
with
reference
to
the
conception,
the
different
conception,
the
opposing
conception
as
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
requirement
in
south
carolina
workmen's
compensation
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
reversal
was
not
based
with
reference
to
that
point
that
you're
making
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
giving
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
benefit
of
the
most
favorable
construction.
and
on
that
basis,
he
construed
the
workmen's
compensation
law
of
south
carolina
the
way
you
construed
it.
i
fully
understand
your
attack
on
his
construction
of
the
statute.
i
do
not
understand
your
claim
that
you
now
would
like
to
offer
something
you
won't
prevent
him
from
offering
at
the
original
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
is
against
him
so
far
as
i
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reference
(inaudible)
ambiguity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
he
granted
that
motion,
before
he
indicated
his
mind,
he
asked
you
whether
you
had
anything
more
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
not
at
this
state
of
the
game.
a
lawsuit
isn't
a
game.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wanted
to
know
--
the
judge
wanted
to
know
what
the
issues
were
before
you
disclose
his
mind
on
the
legal
premises.
and
the
act
was
explicitly
(inaudible)
that
he
has
got
anything
more
to
say.
you
said
not
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
you
were
--
and
i
do
not
regard
it
as
proper
administration
of
justice
for
lawyers
to
sit
back
and
wait
to
see
which
way
to
pass
(inaudible)
and
then
decide
what
position
they'll
take.
i
regard
that
as
hostile
to
the
administration
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
--
all
your
cases,
so
far
as
i
reckon,
indicate
that
the
so-called
little
construction
must
be
given
to
the
statutes
for
the
sake
of
benefitting
(inaudible)
and
not
making
growth
construction
like
your
container
case.
there's
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
that
was
a
question
of
whether
you
look
through
the
corporate,
failed
to
see
that
the
holding
company
was
the
real
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
that
was
proved
because
of
that
question
because
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
subsidiary
company
was
engaged
in
that
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
the
court
says
you
--
it's
sufficient
that
the
immediate
employer
was
a
subsidiary
and
a
legal
entity
and
you
do
not
look
through
that,
and
disregard
that
as
ultimate
holding
company.
that's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
in
that
case,
they
said
what
they've
said
again
and
again
in
south
carolina
that
you
construe
the
statutory,
sweep
in
statutory
employer
rather
than
to
keep
them
out.
now,
you're
arguing
in
the
interest
of
a
workman
to
conspire
the
workmen's
compensation
act
of
south
carolina
because
in
this
particular
case,
the
interest
is
in
direct
to
the
confinement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
court.
the
court
can't
write
legislation
but
they
construe
it
and
the
whole
(inaudible)
was
--
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
but
the
south
carolina
is
in
the
opposite
direction
of
your
general
(inaudible)
namely,
you're
giving
a
list
of
narrow
construction
that
was
--
must
meant
to
be
liberal
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
clause
with
specific
exception.
a
clause
the
statute
makes
within
which
at
the
industry
regarding
which
workmen's
compensation
act
does
not
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
plus
--
plus
gave
workmen
the
benefit
of
(inaudible)
employers
as
against
fly
by
night
impecunious
or
an
inherent
irresponsible
contractor
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
very
important
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
can't
construe.
i
can't
construe
the
statute.
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
to
meet
the
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
under
south
carolina
law
by
one
of
the
most
experienced
judges
in
the
land
had
a
number
of
considerations
before
him
had
given
us
to
construct
of
the
court
of
--
of
the
south
carolina
law.
if
the
south
carolina
law,
construed
by
a
court
with
experienced
judges
and
(inaudible)
south
carolina,
one
of
them
a
member
of
it,
tell
us
what
the
law
is.
you
say
we
could
disregard
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
this
court
has
done
in
the
series
of
cases
much
more
complicated
than
this.
it
says
that
must
be
obviously
wrong
for
this
court
to
reject
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
telling
is
the
lawful
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
federal
statute,
not
a
local
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
moore
the
district
judge?
where
is
he
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
justice
parker
and
judge
soper,
how
long
have
they
sat
in
--
in
south
carolina?
how
often
do
they
sit?
presumably,
they
know
more
about
south
carolina
law
than
we
do,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
the
best
answer
you
can
give.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we've
got
courts
of
appeals
that
suppose
to
review
district
judges.
and
now,
for
the
first
time
i
hear
we
must
yield
to
the
local
district
judges
instead
of
the
court
of
appeals.
how
long
had
judge
soper
sat
in
south
carolina?
how
long
has
he
been
down
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
30
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
many
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
just
strikes
me
as
odd
that
something
that
is
so
unequivocal,
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
read
it,
could
have
escaped
the
understanding
of
judge
parker
and
judge
soper.
it
does
strike
me
as
odd
for
any
lawyer
to
make
such
a
claim.
