it.
chief

earl
warren
mr.
forrest.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
it
before
he
was
taken
into
custody,
mr.
forrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forrest
there
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
were
some
statements
made
by
counsel
to
the
effect
that
a
detective
told
him
that
it
wouldn't
be
well
for
him
to
get
out
that
the
--
the
crowd
might
do
something
to
him.
do
you
--
do
you
--
would
you
mind
giving
us
your
recollection
of
that
phase
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
at
all,
would
you
tell
me
your
--
your
version
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no,
no.
take
it
up
in
your
own
time
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
anytime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
do
you
mean
that
--
what
do
you
mean?
did
the
--
did
the
state
put
him
on
and
have
him
deny
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
he
cross
examine
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forrest,
you
--
you
said
he
went
--
when
he
went
to
the
hospital,
he
went
there
of
his
own
free
choice.
now,
when
you
say
choice,
do
you
mean
the
choice
between
staying
in
jail
or
going
to
the
hospital,
or
do
you
mean
the
choice
between
going
to
the
hospital
and
having
his
free
will?does
the
record
show
which
--
which
kind
of
a
choice
he
had?
i
just
want
it
because
it
could
be
one
thing
if
they
--
if
he
could
have
his
freedom
and
--
or
go
to
the
hospital
be
quite
another.
if
--
if
his
only
choice
was
between
sleeping
in
a
cell
on
--
on
an
iron
bed
or
going
to
--
to
a
hospital
or
he
could
sleep
in
a
--
in
a
regular
bed.
now,
does
the
record
show
what
kind
of
a
choice
he
was
given?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
so
because
you're
not
answering
it.
you
--
you
told
us
that
during
--
during
the
time
he
was
under
arrest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
before
arraignment
that
he
went
twice
to
the
state
hospital.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
told
us
also
that
he
went
there
of
his
own
choice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
asked
you
what
choice
he
exercised.
did
he
exercise
the
choice
just
between
remaining
in
a
--
in
a
cell
under
arrest
where
he
had
to
sleep
on
an
iron
bed
or
go
to
the
hospital
or
did
he
have
his
choice
of
going
to
the
hospital
or
having
his
freedom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
--
a
choice
has
got
to
be
between
two
things
at
least,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
choice
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
then
--
then
we
get
at
this
way
then.
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
he
was
not
under
restraint
when
he
was
in
the
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
was
the
defendant
under
arrest
at
that
time?
when
he
took
him
to
the
jail,
was
he
under
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
how
long
did
he
remain
under
arrest
before
he
--
he
went
--
was
taken
for
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
--
was
the
--
did
he
go
before
a
magistrate
20
days
after
he
was
taken
into
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
not
talking
about
him
deducting
and
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
theory
of
the
state
in
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
this
matter.
was
--
it's
your
position
that
he
went
to
the
--
to
the
hospital
of
his
own
free
will.
when
they
finished
with
him
at
the
hospital,
was
he
operating
under
his
own
free
will
to
go
where
he
wanted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
taken
under
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
same
thing
happened
the
second
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
want
us
to
conclude
from
that
that
he
was
not
under
arrest
while
he
was
in
the
hospital?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
where
do
you
base
it
on
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
he
say
--
didn't
he
say
though
in
the
record
that
the
reason
he
went
there
was
because
he'd
rather
have
a
decent
place
to
sleep
and
sleep
in
a
--
in
a
bed
rather
than
in
the
cot
or
whatever
it
was,
in
the
cell
in
the
jail.
wasn't
that
the
reason
he
gave?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
proceed
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
there
was
no
particular
reason
for
taking
him
to
a
mental
hospital
for
treatment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
--
did
he
say
that
was
during
these
--
these
days
or
what
he
calls
“unlawful
detention”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he's
been
to
the
state
hospital
before
that,
hasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
did
they
take
him
to
a
state
hospital
for?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
inference
--
there
was
--
in
the
record
was,
there's
no
testimony
but
there
was
an
inference
that
they
had
sent
him
there
not
only
for
treatment
for
syphilis
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
that
it
was
also
for
--
for
observation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
thought
you
just
read
us
some
testimony
saying
that
there's
no
question
about
his
mentality.
it
was
very
clear,
it
was
very
sharp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
you
said
is
--
i
understood
him
to
say
his
mind
was
very
clear,
very
sharp.
and
so
--
well,
that
to
me
has
something
to
do
with
a
man's
mental
condition
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
his
mind
is
clear.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
yes.i
supposed
that's
true.
well,
what's
in
the
record,
you
are
going
to
point
to
something
in
the
record
for
me,
will
you?
i
--
i
saw
you
look
towards
the
record.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
point
out
something.
all
right,
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
local
hospital,
county
hospital
or
city
hospital?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wait
a
minute.
no
--
no
question
on
the
problem
on
--
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
thus,
if
a
man
was
arrested
and
held
for
20
odd
days
without
being
taken
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
magistrate,
there's
no
problem
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
his
friends
were
free
to
come
and
see
him
at
anytime,
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
matousec
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
his
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
tacy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
that
before
or
after
he
first
went
to
a
mental
hospital?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
mean
he
made
--
he
made
--
these
proceedings
started
after
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
corbett
visited
him
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
29
days
after
he
was
arrested.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
some
members
of
the
bar
talked
to
their
president,
mr.
corbett
and
said,
“well,
this
fellow,
have
we
got
lawyer
for
the
other
lawyer?”
and
evidently
induced
mr.
corbett
to
see
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
get
the
sequence
in
mind
if
i
--
if
i
can?
where
--
where
was
mr.
triplett
when
--
when
this
gentleman
came
to
see
him,
the
president
of
the
bar
association?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
in
his
jail
cell.
had
he
ever
been
to
the
state
hospital
before
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
when
--
when
did
this
proceeding,
legal
proceeding
and
have
him
examined
as
his
excite
--
apparently
whatever
it
was
in
that
hospital
admission.
chief
justice
earl
warren
right
after
corbett
visited.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
