justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
tacy,
may
i
ask
whether
the
--
the
stenographic
record
is
close
as
the
circumstances
of
--
under
which
mr.
corbett
made
this
offer
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proposed
having
all
we
have
in
the
record
that
i
have
before
me,
is
that
several
lawyers
would
be
glad
to
offer
their
services.
how
did
that
--
does
the
record,
the
stenographic
record
show
how
he
came
to
make
this
visit
and
make
such
an
offer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
there
--
that
may
there
shed
some
light
on
what
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
how
did
that
come
about?
that
isn't
a
normal
thing
unless
it's
normal
in
iowa?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
how
did
that
come
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
record
doesn't
shed
any
light?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
have
been
some
antecedent
something
to
stimulate
the
persons
of
the
bar
association
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
want
to
get
habeas
corpus,
there
are
members
of
the
bar
ready
to
serve
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
pleases
to
read
it
but
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
also
a
stirs
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
now,
that
was
disputed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
source
of
my
curiosity
is
that,
that
what
actually
the
details
of
mr.
corbett's
testimony,
as
in
for
the
minute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
shed
light
on
the
conditions
under
which
the
petitioner
was
then
and
confined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
he
could
be
a
private
judiciary
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
such
suggestion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
--
your
position
isn't
that
the
mere
days
of
detention
without
arraignment
violates
--
is
a
deprivation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
not
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
hearsay
that
he
was
physically
unavailable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
a
mental
hospital?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
--
can
you
give
the
dates
between
mr.
corbett's
visit
and
the
testimony
which
has
just
been
referred
to,
mr.
corbett?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
--
all
right.
and
this
was
--
mr.
corbett
testified
as
to
his
talk
with
the
petitioner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
of
october
1?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
two
talks
as
i
looked
at
the
stenographic
minutes.
mr.
corbett
had
two
--
two
interviews
according
to
the
minutes.
he
was
recalled,
he
was
put
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
whenever
that
was.
you
could
say
that's
october
1st,
and
when
was
the
trial,
the
date
of
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
next
year
--
the
next
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
appeal
affirmative
of
what
you've
just
stated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
it.
i'm
just
pointing
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
apparently,
this
--
he
did
this
all
on
his
own.
didn't
he,
matousec?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
next
question
answered
though?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
he
said
to
mr.
corbett.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
that's
what
he
says
to
the
president
of
the
bar
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
did
he
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
as
to
why
he
went
and
his
attitude
towards
his
going
to
the
cherokee
state
mental
hospital.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
corbett.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
this
that
he
wanted
to
lie
in
a
better
bed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you've
just
said
something.
is
that
in
the
record
that
he
was
before
some
--
some
--
with
some
state
procedure
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
then
there's
a
best
of
reasons
for
having
--
for
having
taken
him
to
the
cherokee
hospital
for
mental
diseases
rather
than
some
city
hospital
of
ordinary
general
diseases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you've
indicated
a
little
while
ago
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
some
procedure
that
for
some
presumably
good
reason,
the
authorities
thought
there
ought
to
be
some
entirely
be
mistaken
his
--
into
his
mental
health.
isn't
that
what
you
said
a
minute
ago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
corbett
didn't
go
there
to
do
something.
he
went
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
what
i've
read
in
the
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
evidently
some
--
if
i
may
so,
commendable
members
of
the
sioux
city
bar
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
present,
i
assume,
there
was
alot
about
this
in
the
newspapers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
offer
himself
as
a
lawyer
he
disavowed
that
completely
and
you
accepted
that
disavowed.
what
he
said
to
the
bar,
members
of
the
bar
that
he
want
a
lawyer.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
all,
not
only
the
testimony
but
you're
--
of
what
you
think
of
mr.
corbett,
makes
one
attached
verity
to
what
he
testified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
he
replied
to
your
questions
by
saying
he
concluded
after
talking
with
triplett.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
triplett's
statement
that
his
rights
were
not
being
interfered
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
did
you
ask
him
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
has
very
clearly
answered.
he
says,
“no,
i
didn't
think
that,”
he
didn't
say
there
was
a
violation
of
disregarding
the
local
statute
of
proper
arraignment.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
did
not
think
that
he's
right.
so
that
is
--
it
isn't
fair
for
us,
i
don't
think
we
can
infer
that
here
is
a
friend
of
the
bar
association
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
i
tried
to
open
that
it
is
the
rights
of
the
board
that
were
being
violated
and
paid
no
attention
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
it
seems
to
be
the
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
isn't
any
of
these
in
the
record,
mr.
tacey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
the
stenographic
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
many
--
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
your
--
that's
a
hypothetic
question
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
is
exactly
the
same
confession,
word
per
word,
every
other
circumstance
is
saying
had
been
made
in
a
(inaudible)
mind
local
hospital
rather
than
in
cherokee,
would
your
position
be
any
different?
