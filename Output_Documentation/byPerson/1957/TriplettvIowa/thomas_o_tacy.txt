mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
chief
justice
warren,
honorable
justices
of
this
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
seemed
to
the
petitioner
to
be
a
case
where
in
the
factual
situation
is
infinitely
more
important
than
the
legal
situation.
in
other
words,
the
petitioner
does
not
propose
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
on
the
legal
questions
involved
here
unless
something
new
is
raised
by
the
respondent
concerning
the
law.
i
think
it's
conceded
by
both
sides
that
this
court
has
the
right
in
certiorari
to
review
de
novo
the
entire
proceedings
in
a
state
court
in
a
criminal
case
and
to
determine
and
make
an
independent
determination
as
to
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
violated
in
due
process
of
law,
denied
to
the
accused.
the
--
without
going
to
an
extended
argument
now
about
the
law,
the
recent
decisions
and
the
past
decisions
going
back
many
years
indicate
that
there
should
be
no
question
about
this
proposition.
and
now,
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
on
august
31st,
1954,
a
little
boy
by
the
name
of
jimmy
bremmers
disappeared
from
his
home,
sioux
city,
iowa.
and
about
29
days
later,
his
body
was
found
after
extended
search
in
a
pasture
about
6
miles
from
sioux
city
out
on
a
winding
country
road.
it
happened
at
this
time
that
mr.
ernest
triplett
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
soliciting
music
lessons
from
parents
in
the
vicinity
where
jimmy
bremmers
lived
on
the
night
he
disappeared
and
on
other
occasions.
now,
a
neighbor
out
in
that
vicinity
called
the
police
department
in
sioux
city
and
said
there
was
a
music
salesman
out
here
soliciting
music
lessons
the
night
jimmy
disappeared.
and
on
that
suspicion
alone,
ernest
triplett
was
requested
or
his
employer
was
requested
to
have
mr.
triplett
wait
for
the
police
because
they
want
to
question
him.
now,
this
request
for
mr.
triplett
to
wait
at
his
employer's
office,
the
flood
music
company
in
sioux
city
for
the
police
came
in
about
9:30.
mr.
flood
testified
as
he
didn't
appear
nervous
at
all.
he
said,
“yes,
i'll
wait
for
them.”
he
waited
for
them
until
1:30
in
the
afternoon,
went
out
and
got
his
lunch
and
came
back.
and
then
about
1:30
in
the
afternoon,
they
came
to
get
him.
and
detective
dennison
and
matousec,
sioux
city
police,
took
him
into
custody
where
as
the
record
shows
here,
he
was
detained
without
a
warrant
for
a
total
of
20
or
21
days
by
the
police
and
that
interval
of
detention
was
interrupted
twice
by
sending
him
down
to
the
state
hospital
for
mental
treatment
at
cherokee,
iowa
near
sioux
city.
now,
the
first
instance
he
was
sent
down
there
by
the
request,
he
says
detective
--
one
of
the
detectives
in
sioux
city
and
that
was
on
september
15th,
1954.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
had
none
and
no
record
of
any
felonies.
his
record
was
clear
as
to
any
felony
or
any
mental
trouble.
then
after
he
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
what
is
it?
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
i
say
that
but
no
record
of
any
--
of
any
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
oh,
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
might
have
been
that
he
would
--
had
been
arrested
for
some
minor
offense
like
being
drunk
or
something
like
that,
but
no,
no
major
crime.
no
sex
crime.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no
sex
crime.
no
--
no
other
felony.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
the
--
the
officers
said
that
he
was
sent
down
there
for
--
first,
for
treatment
at
his
request.
however,
he
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
they
said
that
--
that
he
should
--
that
it
was
a
treatment
for
an
old
case
of
syphilis.
now,
he
denies
that
that
he
requested
that.
he
says
the
officer
has
requested
it
and
made
out
the
application
for
him
and
he
signed
it.
be
that
as
it
may,
he
was
brought
back
from
the
institution
later.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
that's
--
that's
what
the
record
shows.
he
says
he
went
down
there
because
he
could
rest
better
on
the
beds
down
there,
he
thought,
than
on
the
steel
mattress,
steel
mesh
in
the
jail
of
sioux
city.
now,
the
question
here
--
the
whole
question
here
is
whether
this
confession
which
was
obtained
and
i
want
to
make
this
a
little
bit
short
now
at
the
present
time.
this
confession
was
obtained
when
he
was
taken
to
the
mental
hospital
for
the
second
time.
now,
after
he
was
been
jailed
and
questioned
practically
everyday
for
20
days
in
the
sioux
city
jail
without
being
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
there
was
one
in
the
same
building
down
the
hall,
the
detectives
admit
that
they
questioned
him
everyday.
and
when
asked
that
when
he
reiterated
over
and
over
that
he
wasn't
guilty,
he
wouldn't
take
no
for
an
answer,
and
they
said,
“no.”
and
the
defendant
testified,
the
accused
testified.
that
after
he
reached
a
certain
point,
that
he
didn't
deny
anything
further,
he
--
and
this
is
his
language
--
and
showed
you
the
character
of
the
education
or
lack
of
the
man.
he
testifies
there
wasn't
no
use
to
deny
nothing.
“you
tell
him
and
they
would
turn
right
around
and
shove
it
back
in
your
mouth.”
that's
his
language
in
the
record
here,
both
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
--
in
the
record
itself.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
oh,
he
was
confined.
and
the
record
shows
he
was
under
custody
--
the
custody
of
the
police
all
the
time.
i
brought
that
out
very
carefully.
it's
in
the
record,
sir,
that
he
--
he
never
at
any
time
could
leave.
that's
admitted
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
he
was
a
long
ways
from
his
family,
it
seemed.
he
had
a
brother
in
oregon
who
is
a
preacher
but
he
wasn't
out
there.
and
he
testifies
he
was
trying
to
earn
enough
money
in
the
music
solicitation
business
to
go
up
where
his
brother
was.
but
now,
he
was
visited.
we'll,
get
this
now.
he
was
visited
after
he
was
29
days
either
in
police
custody,
20
days
and
in
the
hospital
a
part
of
the
time.
he
was
approached
by
stanley
corbett
who
was
then
the
president
of
the
sioux
city
bar
association
and
stanley
corbett
asked
him
if
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
and
his
reply
was
that
he
wasn't
guilty
of
anything.he
didn't
know
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that
is
what
mr.
corbett
testified
to.
mr.
triplett
testified
he
didn't,
remember
that.
but
also,
mr.
triplett
testified
the
reason
he
didn't
want
to
get
out
on
the
street
now
was
that
the
--
a
detective
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
the
reason
why
he
said
that
mr.
--
a
detective
in
sioux
city,
the
record
will
show
his
name,
told
him
that
it
would
not
be
good
for
him
to
get
out
on
the
street
and
let
the
public
get
a
hold
of
him
because
what
they
want
to
do
to
you.
now,
that's
in
the
record
and
it
is
uncontradicted.
and
the
detective
who
is
supposed
to
have
told
him
that
was
in
the
courtroom
and
so
was
the
prosecutor
and
it
isn't
denied
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
the
--
no,
the
--
your
honor.
the
implication
there
is
that
this
detective
that
told
him
it
wouldn't
be
safe
for
him
on
the
street
and
the
only
thing
that
stanley
corbett
a
lawyer,
he
was
suggesting,
was
whether
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
now,
he
wasn't
advised
to
his
rights
to
a
lawyer
and,
your
--
your
honor,
i
take
--
we
take
this
position.
those
men
are
not
in
position
to
set
themselves
up
as
a
magistrate
and
decide
whether
this
man
wants
a
lawyer
or
not.
they're
holding
him
there
against
the
iowa
statute
which
is
similar
to
the
statutes
of
other
states
that
they
must
take
him
before
a
magistrate
without
unnecessary
delay
and
they're
not
doing
that.
they're
holding
him
there.
now,
he
--
he
testifies
that
he
was
afraid
there.
that
is
that
mr.
--
the
detective
had
told
him
what
would
happen
if
he
got
on
the
street.
now,
here's
something
significant,
your
honor.
you'll
find
all
through
the
record,
in
the
--
in
the
brief
and
argument
quoting
the
record
that
this
man
was
not
free
to
go.
he
was
always
under
police
custody
and
was
under
arrest
without
a
warrant
all
this
time.
he
was
not
free
to
go.
you
will
find
that
in
the
record.
and
when
this
confession
was
taken,
here
was
the
circumstance.
stanley
corbett
visited
him
on
october
the
1st.
then,
according
to
the
respondent's
version
of
the
defendant's
testimony,
he
was
then
taken
to
the
state
mental
hospital.
then,
now
here's
what
happened
after
stanley
corbett
offered
legal
help.
the
man
was
taken
to
the
commission
on
insanity
in
sioux
city
and
committed
to
the
state
mental
hospital
again,
and
only
three
days
elapsed
before
they
got
this
confession
from
him.
and
when
this
confession
which
is
the
gist
of
this
case,
whether
it
was
voluntary
or
not,
is
the
gist
of
this
case,
this
confession
was
taken
from
him.
now,
on
the
6th
of
october
--
so
between
the
1st
of
october
and
the
5th
of
october,
they
took
him
to
sioux
city
and
having
him
committed
to
cherokee
again
where
the
lawyer
couldn't
have
done
anything
if
he'd
wanted
to.
and
on
the
6th
of
october
now,
five
days
after
stanley
corbett
offered
to
help;
his
confession
was
gotten
from
him
by
chief
of
--
not
chief
detective
but
rather
the
psychiatrist
within
the
--
the
same
hospital
by
the
name
of
dr.azordegan.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he'd
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
sir.
it
--
according
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
according
to
mr.
corbett's
testimony
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
was
the
president
of
the
local
bar
association
and
some
of
the
bars
suggested
that
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
it
isn't
normal
in
iowa.
it
is
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
i
--
i
do
not
know,
sir.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
the
record
doesn't
show.
he
just
went
and
asked
him
if
he
wanted
a
lawyer
and
said
some
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
he
said
some
of
the
other
lawyer
had
suggested.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
i
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
we
might
also
inquire,
your
honor,
why
mr.
corbett
didn't
insist
on
having
him
arraigned
when
he'd
already
been
held
29
days
without
arraignment
at
that
time
if
he
was
there
to
protect
him.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
mr.
corbett
you
mean?
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
testified
that
he
offered
him
--
he
said
that
he
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
they
told
him
they
bar
association
would
furnish
him
counsel
but
he
said
he
did
not
want
to
leave
the
jail
or
the
hospital
whichever
place
he
might
be.
is
that
the
testimony?
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
--
i
think
that
is
mr.
corbett's
testimony.
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
what
is
it?
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
that's
disputed.
now,
mr.
triplett
says
he
doesn't
remember
saying
that
to
mr.
corbett
or
mr.
corbett
saying
that
to
him.
but
he
also
says
that
he
was
under
this
fear
of
mob
violence
and
that
is
not
disputed
in
the
record.
now,
the
question
in
my
mind
is,
your
honor.
could
these
people,
even
mr.
corbett,
and
could
these
detectives
set
themselves
up
as
magistrates
and
decide
whether
or
not
this
man
wanted
a
lawyer.
his
rights
to
due
process
would
be
to
take
him
before
a
magistrate
where
all
his
rights
would
be
explained
to
him
by
a
magistrate
not
by
some
president
or
some
bar
association.
i
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
was
arraigned
on
first
degree
murder.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
they
arrested
him
for
the
--
evidently
for
the
murder
of
jimmy
bremmers.
so,
they
had
to
arrest
him
for
it
and
he
was
taken
in
without
a
warrant.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
the
--
the
boy's
body
had
been
found
i
believe
on
the
--
but
mr.
corbett
didn't
know
about
that
at
the
time.
i
don't
believe
that
he
knew.
i
think
the
record
will
show
that.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
the
date
of
the
arrest,
well,
it's
found
29
days
later.
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
and
now,
the
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
that's
right
and
then
they
immediately
took
mr.
triplett
from
the
jail
and
took
him
out
into
the
country
where
the
boy's
body
was
found
and
showed
him
a
blanket
covered
body
and
--
and
such
as
that.
now,
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
and
i
want
to
save
a
little
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
necessary.
the
reason
they
held
this
man
is
expressed
in
one
sentence
by
william
dennison,
the
man
who
arrested
him,
and
i
asked
him
on
cross-examination,
“why
didn't
you
take
this
man
before
a
magistrate
as
the
law
requires
you
to
do
before
you
got
the
confession
instead
of
afterwards
hold
him
in
for
some
20
days
in
the
police
custody?”
he
said
"because
i
still
thought
he
was
guilty."
now,
they
can
say
what
the
police
about
why
they
held
him
but
that's
the
testimony
of
the
chief
detectives
under
whose
custody
was
because
he
still
thought
he
was
guilty.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
that
is
not,
sir.
but
the
way
that
the
confession
was
gotten
in
the
insane
hospital
after
he's
committed
there
and
dr.azordegan
promised
him
a
job
at
the
hospital
work
to
do
and
let
him
out
in
a
couple
of
years
if
he
confessed.
now,
that's
uncontradicted
in
the
record,
we
you
understand.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that's
right.
the
whole
totality
of
it,
i
think
violates
every
concept
of
the
due
process
of
law.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that's
right.
the
doctor
was
not
available
for
some
reason.
they
gave
a
lot
of
reasons
but
they
didn't
--
it
was
all
hearsay.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
they
said
--
no,
they
didn't
say
that
by
direct
testimony.
they
asked
bill
sanguin
who
was
a
--
a
tenant
at
the
hospital
where
dr.
azordegan
was
and
he
said
he
heard
a
report
that
he
was
overseas.
then
they
asked
the
accused
himself
on
cross
examination,
“haven't
you
been
advised
that
dr.azordegan
is
overseas?”
and
triplett
answered,
“no,
i
haven't
been
advised.
i
heard
it
a
minute
ago."
now,
there's
all
we
got
in
there.
they
didn't
call
the
superintendent
to
know
why
there
was
two
doctors
left
at
the
hospital
right
after
this
thing
happened.
this
confession
taken
in
the
hospital
was
taken
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
the
superintendent
by
the
way.
and
we
have
our
suspicion
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
sir.
a
tape
recording.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
it's
on
page
--
in
--
in
the
record,
the
--
that's
the
page
--
the
confession
40
--
40
to
49.
yes,
i'd
like
to
save
a
little
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
how
much
time
do
i
have,
chief
justice,
do
you
know?
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
do
you
know
how
much
time
i
have?
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
all
right.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
i'll
state
that.
that
the
trial
was
held
the
30th
in
june.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
the
next
year
of
this
confession
of
the
statement,
october.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
(inaudible)
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court's
endowed
about
under
what
circumstances
the
accused
went
to
cherokee
state
mental
hospital
the
first
time
on
page
75
of
the
record.
triplett
was
asked,
it
--
bottom
of
page
74
of
the
record.
“did
you
not
request
to
go
to
cherokee
mental
hospital?”
he
answers,
“the
request
was
made
to
mr.
gibbons.”
gibbons
said,
“i'll
let
you
write
the
letter.”
he
says,
“you
can
or
is
your
arm
cramped
this
morning?
and
i
will
tell
you
what
to
put
in
that
letter.”
and
he
says,
“put
it
in
there
so,
so
at
your
own
request,
signed.”
“would
you
call
that
your
own
request
or
would
you
call
it
the
request
of
mr.
gibbons?”
that's
the
circumstances
on
which
you
first
went
positive.
now
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
yes,
“did
you
want
to
go
to
cherokee?”
answer,
“do
i
want
to
lay
in
a
good
bed
or
lay
on
steel.”
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
no,
no,
that's
what
he
said
to
--
in
cross-examination.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
you
mean
in
their
interchange
by
this
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
--
he
said
that.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
you
mean
he
said
that
in
the
interchange
of
conversation
between
him
and
mr.
corbett.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
he
didn't.
he
said
that
--
that
he
hadn't
done
anything
and
he
thought
they
were
going
to
turn
him
loose.
that's
his
testimony.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well,
mr.
corbett
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
mr.
corbett
came
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
now,
mr.
corbett
came
to
see
him
after
he's
been
in
custody
29
days.
then
as
soon
as
mr.
corbett
offered
him
assistance,
and
i
draw
an
inference
from
this
which
possibly
i
am
allowed
to
draw.
they
took
him
--
according
to
the
record
here,
they
took
him
immediately
to
sioux
city
before
the
insane
commission
and
had
him
committed
to
the
cherokee
state
mental
hospital
for
observation
in
what
is
known
as
the
--
as
the
observation
ward.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that's
right.
he
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
well,
he
--
he
was
--
he
signed
--
he
signed
an
application
that
time
that
they
request
the
officers,
they
put
an
x
for
him
to
sign
and
he
signed
it
that
he's
inflicted
with
his
--
he's
inflicted
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
it
is
not
in
the
record,
sir.
this
record
is
not
too
complete.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
what
is
it?
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
i
--
i
think,
sir
that
that
is
--
if
that
is
in
the
record
that
--
i
think
it's
--
i
think
the
state
referred
to
that
in
their
--
i
believe
in
their
--
they
say
--
they
say
as
soon
as
mr.
corbett's
interview,
he
may
say
he
was
then
taken
to
the
state
mental
hospital.
that's
all
we
have
here.
that
he
was
then
taken.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
well
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
i
believe
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
now
that
--
the
statement
i
made
was
when
corbett
came
to
see
him
after
29
days
of
detention
partly
in
the
hospital
and
partly
in
the
office
of
the
--
or
rather
the
police
station
in
sioux
city.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
after
corbett
visited.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
and
instead
of
giving
corbett
time
to
do
something,
they
took
him
right
down
there
and
the
fourth
day
got
this
confession.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
to
find
out.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
very
much
so.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
i
consider
mr.
corbett
a
very
reputable
member
of
the
bar.
his
intentions
were
good.
but
i
say
that
when
he
had
a
suspicion
that
this
man's
rights
were
being
invaded,
due
process
denied
him,
i
think
it
was
his
duty
if
he
was
going
to
give
the
man
any
advice.
i
think
it
was
his
duty
to
tell
the
officers
to
arraign
him
right
there.
there
were
some
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
wasn't
being
held
against
his
will.
that's
--
yes,
he
concluded
that.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
sir.
and
he
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
oh,
no.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
i
don't
think
that.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that.
i
would
like
to
refer
now
briefly
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
was
in
a
jail
cell.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
he
had
been
there
on
the
15th
of
september
and
stayed
a
little
while.
that's
the
time
that
he
said
he
wanted
to
--
he'd
like
to
sleep
on
a
better
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
--
bed.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
and
then
when
mr.
corbett
interviewed
him,
it
was
15
days
later.
that
is
the
1st
of
october.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
then
immediately,
he
was
taken
to
the
state
hospital
again
to
put
through
the
screening
center
and
to
be
examined,
and
then
the
fourth
day
now,
after
mr.
corbett
interviewed
him,
they
had
that
confession
out
of
him
down
there
on
the
6th
of
october.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
right
after
corbett
visited.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
the
state's
brief
--
the
state's
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes,
it
is
in
the
record,
sir.
i
think
i
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
it's
in
the
--
yes,
it's
in
the
stenographic
minute.
it's
in
the
reporter's
transcript,
certainly.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
oh
yes,
that's
all
in
the
reporter's
transcript.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
i
think
so,
sir.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
you
will
find
all
of
that
in
the
--
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
that's
right.
and
they
are
in
the
reporter's
transcript
which
we
called
the
--
the
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
it
is
not
sir.
it
is
under
--
it's
under
the
regular
insanity
statute.
just
plain
insanity,
that's
what
it
says.
that
the
--
the
applicants
or
those
who
apply
it
for
them
is
afflicted
with
insanity.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no.
not
with
the
--
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
no,
and
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
sexual
psychopathic
statute
in
iowa
is
very
recent.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
even
as
in
existence
and
--
but
there
was
nothing
about
that.
it
was
plain
insanity.
now,
i
want
to
say
just
--
if
i
can
say
one
more
word
now.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
that
here
is
a
confession
that
was
extorted
from
this
man
in
an
insane
hospital
when
there
had
been
no
finding
made
as
to
why
he
was
down
there
or
whether
he
couldn't
--
should
have
been
sent
down
there
and
it
as
under
circumstances
that
couldn't
have
been
carried
on
in
a
court
of
law.
it
wasn't
a
voluntary
confession.
it
was
a
grueling
cross-examination
by
four
different
people.
one
attendant
in
the
hospital
had
him
in
charge,
one
detective
and
two
doctors
got
part
in
it.
there
was
no
voluntary
expression
on
his
part.
there's
nothing
that
came
from
his
own
mind,
he
so
testified.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
yes.
mr.
thomas
o.
tacy
oh,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
sir.
i
don't
believe
it
would.
