mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
recently
interested
itself
in
a
number
of
cases
similar
to
the
one
now
before
it.
the
gist
of
these
cases,
that
is
those
cases
which
pertain
to
state
criminal
prosecutions,
has
been
to
determine
--
for
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
and
a
confession
obtained
in
the
period
of
custody
was
obtained
in
such
a
manner
as
to
violate
the
--
the
petitioners
or
the
defendants
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
--
the
confession
was
obtained
by
physical
or
mental
coercion.
the
test
as
recently
reaffirmed
in
the
payne
case
on
monday
remains.
it's
the
contrasting
of
the
pressures
that
are
applied
to
the
person
confessing
as
opposed
to
his
power
to
resist.
that
question
as
pointed
out
by
the
respondents
certainly
can
--
or
by
the
petitioner
can
certainly
best
be
answered
by
a
close
examination
into
the
facts.
i'd
like
to
talk
first
about
the
general
fact
background
and
later,
more
particularly
about
some
of
the
specific
testimony
given
by
both
police
officers,
the
trial
court
and
specially
the
defendant
himself.
the
general
facts
in
chronological
order
went
about
as
follows.
on
august
31,
the
lad
disappeared.
at
that
time,
the
defendant
was
employed
as
a
door-to-door
solicitor
and
salesman
on
behalf
of
the
flood
music
company
in
sioux
city.
he
was
operating
in
the
neighborhood
in
which
the
boy
lived
and
from
which
he
disappeared
on
the
day
that
he
did
disappear.
when
the
disappearance
of
the
boy
became
generally
known,
a
search
was
instituted.
also,
word
was
passed
to
the
police,
to
the
sioux
city
police
and
thereupon
on
september
2nd,
took
him
to
the
police
station.
shortly
after
he
got
to
the
police
station,
a
private
detective
in
sioux
city
by
the
name
of
matousec
appeared
and
asked
for
a
permission
to
question
triplett.
this
was
granted
and
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
that
he
was
kept
or
in
any
way,
inhibited
from
seeing
the
defendant.
matousec's
testimony
was
that
he
attempted
to
elicit
information
as
to
the
crime
by
suggesting
to
the
defendant
that
he
would
procure
counsel
for
him,
and
this
is
substantiated
by
the
defendant's
testimony.
at
that
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
no,
sir.
this
was
--
this
was
immediately
after
he
was
taken.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
first
few
days
after
he
was
taken
into
custody.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i
am
sorry
that
i
do
not
enjoy
the
same
circumstance
as
the
petitioner
for
the
--
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
does
and
that
he
tried
the
case
in
the
lower
court
and
i
did
not
get
it
until
it
came
to
the
united
states
supreme
court.
but
i'm
--
i
feel
confident
that
the
record
will
bare
--
bare
out
that
in
the
first
few
days
of
his
custody,
he
was
approached
by
matousec
and
refused
matousec's
in
effect
offer
of
counsel.
on
september
15th,
he
volunteered
to
go
to
and
was
taken
to
the
cherokee
mental
health
institute
for
observation.
this
is
the
wording
of
the
record,
“for
observation
and
treatment
of
syphilis.”
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
this
is
a
question
i
cannot
answer,
justice.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
perhaps
it
may
have,
justice
black.
and
i
do
not
--
i
just
don't
know.
i'm
not
that
well
acquainted
with
the
trial
court
situation
which
was
in
1954.
while
there,
the
body
of
jimmy
bremmers
was
located.
the
defendant
was
brought
back
from
the
mental
health
institute,
taken
to
a
place
on
the
highway
adjacent
to
the
field
in
which
the
body
lay.
the
roadway
there
is
considerably
below
the
--it's
--
in
other
words,
it's
a
cut
in
a
hill.
the
defendant
without
instructions
from
anyone
walked
diagonally
directly
up
bank.
i
believe
he
went
across
to
a
point
outside
the
fence,
pointed
to
the
body
and
said,
what
is
that?
there
was
some
evidence
that
he
turned
pale
at
the
time
that
he
did
that.
after
he
viewed
the
body,
he
was
returned
to
the
sioux
city
police
station,
kept
there
for
a
few
more
days.
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
visit
of
the
then
sioux
city
bar
association
president
stanley
corbett
took
place.
mr.
corbett
came
in,
asked
to
see
the
defendant.
again,
there
was
no
inhibition.
he
was
allowed
to
see
him.
and
at
that
time,
he
--
in
substance,
what
he
asked
him
was,
"are
you
being
held
against
your
will?"
and
he
said,
he
was
not
being
held
against
his
will
because
he
wanted
to
help
the
police
solve
the
murder.
he
was
also
asked
or
offered
counsel
to
take
his
choice
of
counsel
in
the
sioux
city
area.
this,
he
steadfastly
refused
as
he
had
done
previously.
i
should
probably
point
out
also
that
detective
dennison
testified
that
on
numerous
occasions,
three
or
four
times
in
the
period
between
2
and
15th
of
september.
the
first
period
of
incarceration
or
custody
that
he
asked
him
about
--
if
he
wanted
an
attorney
and
he
steadfastly
refused
the
services
of
an
attorney.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i'm
--
thank
you.
counsel
for
petitioner
informs
me
that
he
was
52.
i
was
going
to
say
that
i'm
sure
that
he
was
middle-aged.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i
don't
know
in
what
you
mean
--
in
what
way
do
you
mean
it's
peculiar,
justice?
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
of
course,
azordegan,
the
doctor,
the
psychiatrist
to
obtain
the
confession
was
an
iranian.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
not
very
well.
no,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
from
the
beginning
of
his
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
i
--
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
he
was
in
a
mental
hospital.
azordegan
was
a
staff
psychiatrist
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
corbett's
testimony
was
that
he
was
not
being
held
against
his
will
and
that
he
steadfastly
refused
the
offer
of
services
of
counsel
in
the
sioux
city
area.
the
defendant
then
was
returned
again
at
his
own
request
to
the
cherokee
institution,
the
mental
health
institute,
and
it
was
on
this
period
that
the
confession
was
obtained.
as
near
as
i
can
gather
from
what
is
in
the
record,
what
happened
was
that
the
mental
institute
people
who
help
people
down
there
called
the
sioux
city
police,
had
them
come
down.
they
test
--
the
sioux
city
police
testified
that
they
did
not
know
a
confession
was
to
be
gotten
that
afternoon.
when
they
got
there,
they
were
taken
in
a
room,
there
were
three
or
four
police
--
two
--
two
police
officers
present.
azordegan,
the
psychiatrist,
who
--
whose
voice
you
will
hear
on
exhibit
p
which
is
with
the
court.
the
--
of
course
the
petitioner
and
one
bill
saying
when
a
staff
--
a
member
of
the
staff
at
the
mental
health
institute
who
operated
the
tape
recording
machine.he
made
his
confession
and
the
trial
was
then
had
on
the
merits.
now,
since
that
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
state's
reaction
to
that,
you
realize
that
--
that
this
is
uncorroborated
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
--
the
defended
himself,
when
he
took
the
stand
insisted
that
one
of
the
police
officers
told
him,
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
police
officers,
told
him
that
--
inferred
to
him,
i
don't
think
the
language
is
exactly
mob
actions
but
inferred
to
him
that
if
he
got
out
of
the
police
station,
there
would
be
dire
consequences.
now,
in
connection
with
that
i
intended
to
take
it
up
a
little
later
but
i'll
take
it
up
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
i'll
just
have
to
deal
with
it
right
now,
justice.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
on
the
one
hand,
that
points
again
to
the
volunteer
nature
of
his
custody
and
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
gibbons
was
certainly
available
to
the
petitioner
for
cross-examination.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
state
did
not
do
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
was
the
statement
made,
i
guess,
the
statement
was
made
subsequent
to
--
well,
they
could
have
--
surely,
he
could
have
been
recalled.
well,
i'd
like
to
concede
that
point.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
mr.
corbett's
visit
took
place
on
october
1.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i
would
have
to
refer
to
counsel
for
the
petition.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
man
was
arrested
in
january
and
the
trial
held
the
next
june
6th.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
now,
since
the
test
as
to
whether
or
not
this,
the
confession
that
was
admitted
for
the
evidence
violates
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
whether
--
is
--
involves
looking
at
the
pressures
that
were
applied
to
him
with
respect
to
his
ability
to
withstand
those
pressures.
i
would
like
to
go
at
--
into
some
detail
into
the
facts
which
--
most
of
which
i
have
set
out
on
pages
4,
5
and
6
i
believe
of
--
well
4
through
10
of
the
state's
brief
beginning
with
police
officer
dennison.
he
testified
that
mr.
triplett
wasn't
kept
when
he
was
in
custody.
he
slept
regularly,
was
not
interviewed
for
any
sustained
period
of
time
that
he
said,
quote,
"i
want
to
go
along
with
you
boys,
i
want
to
cooperate
with
you."
that
triplett
volunteered
to
go
to
the
mental
health
instituted
charity.
now,
the
volunteering
on
those
things
i
think
is
better
brought
out
by
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
does
not
contend
that
he
was
in
custody
any
of
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
mental
health
institute.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i
don't
think
there's
a
contention
by
the
--
by
the
petitioner
as
to
why
he
went
there.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
state
contends
that
he
went
there
voluntarily,
that
they
offered
to
take
him
there.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
for
the
--
the
purposes
of
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
only
--
the
only
explanation
that
i
can
offer
to
you,
justices,
that
which
appears
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
he
makes
a
reference
to
a
petition
--
petition
for
insanity
against
the
petitioner.
is
that
not
correct,
mr.
tacy?
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
he
alludes
to
some
civil
procedure
taken
prior
to
trial.
there
is
no
further
reference
to
it
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
there
is
no
reference
to
it
in
the
trial
court
record.
i
think
i
should
also
point
out
this.
that
under
the
iowa
statute,
i
believe
it's
783.3,
the
court
is
required
to
stop
the
trial
and
have
a
trial
on
the
insanity
issue
if
any
evidence
is
presented
to
it
either
on
its
own
motion
or
on
the
part
of
either
party
as
to
insanity
of
the
defendant.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
this
was
not
done.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
now,
your
question?
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
certainly,
it
does
show
that
whether
it
shows
that
he
was
sent
there
for
other
reasons,
i
don't
think
so,
specially
in
view
of
the
counsel's
statement
that
the
petitioner
[laughs]
there
to
go
down
there
because
he
would
rather
sleep
on
a
mattress
than
on
the
steel
bed
that
was
given
to
him
in
the
sioux
city,
which
incidentally
the
record
shows
he
was
given
a
mattress
after
a
few
days.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i
think
that
he
knew
he
was
going
there
for
observation
as
well
as
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
presumably
homosexual
tendencies.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
no,
sir.
i
wish
there
were.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
it
is
one
of
those
institutions
where
that
treatment
and
diagnosis
may
be
made.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
the
state
contends
that
this
was
voluntarily
on
the
basis
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
we
have
both.
the
court
may
--
there
--
there
are
civil
proceedings,
there
are
--
there
are
summary
proceedings
by
a
court
in
a
criminal
case
and
there
are
--
in
other
words,
he
can
be
both
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
the
--
the
only
statement
that
he
was
sent
there
for
observation
and
treatment
of
syphilis.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i
don't
think
i
can
put
my
finger
on
it
this
minute
if
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
thank
you.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
perhaps
i
should
first
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
he
got
a
mattress
after
a
few
days.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i'd
say
perhaps
i
should
first
point
out
that
he
--
the
record
shows
he
did
get
a
mattress
after
a
few
days
but
be
that
as
it
may.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
without
going
outside
the
record
are
the
implications
to
be
--
to
be
taken
from
the
record.
in
other
words
the
petitioner
makes
no
allegation
to
that
effect.
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
did
not
stop
the
trial
and
hold
a
criminal
proceeding.
do
i
--
if
i
understood
your
question
correctly
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
this
is
true.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
i
think
he
had
his
choice
of
going
to
the
hospital,
certainly.
whether
he
had
his
choice
of
freedom,
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
of
course
our
contention
is
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
--
that
--
that
his
choice
was
also
that
he
stay
in
prison.
that's
what
he
asked
to
do.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
if
i
answer
yes
to
that,
i
have
nothing
in
the
record
to
substantiate
me
except
the
implication,
the
necessary
implication.
the
record
and
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
insist
that
he
was
held
20
days,
well
of
course,
the
actual
period
of
custody
was
even
longer
than
20
days
when
you
add
in
those
periods
of
custody
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
in
the
mental
health
institute.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
he
does
not
choose
to
add
those
periods.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
--
indicative
of
the
fact
that
he
had
a
choice
whether
he
was
going
down
there
and
that
he
did
not
contend
that
he
was
at
that
time
in
custody.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
20
days.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest

dennison,
officer
dennison
testified
that
when
triplett
was
in
custody,
he
slept
regularly,
was
not
interviewed
for
any
sustained
period
of
time.
that
he
could
not
easily
be
led
in
the
discussions
in
the
questioning
of
him.
that
he
was
of
normal
mentality.
triplett
--
that
triplett
volunteered
to
go
to
the
mental
health
institute
for
observation
and
treatment
of
syphilis,
record
page
97.
on
three
or
four
occasions,
he
asked
triplett
if
he
wanted
a
lawyer
and
the
defendant
said
he
did
not
want
any
lawyer.
that
there
were
never
any
promises
or
threats
made.
that
he
did
not
expect
a
confession
the
day
he
went
to
the
mental
health
institute.
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
custody,
his
treatment
generally
speaking
was
good.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
statement
of
gibson
--
of
harry
--
of
chief
detective
harry
gibbons.
a
sioux
city
bar
association
president
said
in
effect
at
mr.
triplett,
that
he
informed
mr.
triplett
if
he
was
being
held
against
his
will
to
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
he
would
give
assistance
of
counsel
for
him,
and
that
triplett
insisted
that
he
did
not
want
to
leave
the
jail
or
the
hospital
whichever
place
he
might
be
stating
he
had
no
other
place
to
go
and
that
he
wanted
to
stay
there
and
work
for
mr.
gibbons
in
attempting
to
solve
this
murder.
chief
of
police
russell
white
testified
that
he
was
normal
with
respect
to
mentality
and
alertness
and
probably
he's
a
harder
person
to
interrogate
as
i
have
ever
encountered.
he's
very
alert.
i
don't
think
anybody
during
my
time
of
being
with
him
and
listening
to
him
ever
was
ahead
of
erny
triplett
on
interrogation.
that
he
never
made
any
promises
or
threats
to
the
defendant
and
that
no
one
did
in
his
presence.
and
that
triplett
was
of
average
intelligence,
exceedingly
alert
and
his
mind
was
not
easily
led
or
swayed.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
the
only
other
evidence
that
i
know
of
is
what
the
--
the
petitioner
has
asserted
that
there
was
this
other
proceeding
challenging
the
sanity
of
the
man.
but
he
makes
no
further
reference
to
it
and
there
is
none
on
the
record
as
to
the
outcome
of
that
proceeding.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
he
said
that
it
followed
immediately
the
visit
of
corbett.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.

yes,

mr.

h.
forrest
testimony
of
officer
dennison.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
of
course.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
necessarily
correlation
between
his
intelligence
in
the
state
of
his
sanity.
i
mean,
i
think
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
but
might
--
but
he
might
very
well
have
a
homosexual
tendency
without
affecting
the
clearness
of
his
mind.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
no,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
since
i
am
so
short
on
time,
i
want
to
go
to
the
very
heart
of
our
argument.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,

city
hospital.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
well,
i'm
sure
it
has
a
security
ward.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
it
--
it
does
not
appear
that
he
was
housed
in
a
security
ward.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
no,
sir.
you
have
considered
a
number
of
factors
previously
as
the
kind
of
pressure
that
when
exerted
on
a
certain
personality,
are
sufficient
to
have
violated
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
among
those
are
age,
comparative
youth
as
you
had
in
the
fikes
case,
education,
you
had
in
the
fikes
case,
mentality,
you
had
in
the
fikes
case
again.
but
contrary
to
this,
we
have
a
52-year
old
white
man.
the
flood's
testimony,
that
is,
the
people
who
employed
him
was
that
he
was
alert
and
active
and
a
good
salesman
for
them.
the
testimony
of
the
police
was
that
he
was
alert.
certainly
his
own
testimony
bears
out
the
fact
that
he
was
articulate.
there
is
no
problem
on
legality
of
arrest
which
you
considered
in
chambers
versus
florida.
no
problem
on
conditions
of
incarceration
as
in
the
watts
case.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
there
is
a
question
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
this
is
a
question
of
delay
of
arraignment
as
in
my
classification.
in
other
words,
the
conditions
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
were
not
violent
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
that's
what
i
meant
to
refer.
there
was
no
period
to
prolong
questioning.
certainly,
the
record
that
the
trial
court
made
on
page
16
verifies
that
there
was
no
physical
violence.
there
was
no
deprivation
of
food
and
rest.
triplett
himself
admitted
he
was
given
coffee
and
so
forth.
there
were
no
relays
of
long
--
long
relays
of
police
officers,
no
emotional
exhaustion
that's
shown
in
the
record.
triplett
bragged
about
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
wear
out
the
--
his
questioners.
counsel
and
friends
were
certainly
admitted
to
see
him.
he
refused
to
take
advantage
or
to
use
them
in
any
way.
he
was
certainly
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
[laughs]
he
was
warned
of
his
--
certainly,
warned
of
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
no,
matousec
was
allowed
to
walk
in.
he
was
a
completely
disinterested
person.
he
was
certainly
not
--
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
he
was
--
witness
matousec
was
the
private
detective
who
visited
him
the
first
few
days.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes,
sir.
he
was
subsequently
employed
by
the
defense
counsel.
so
that
what
we
have
is
a
lengthy
delay.
the
state
does
not
--
does
not
deny
that
the
delay
was
lengthy.
it
does
not
deny
that
it
was
unlawful.
758.1
of
the
colorado
requires
that
he
be
taken
forth
with
two
magistrates.
what
you
have
held
in
stein,
you
have
held
in
alliance,
that
delay
in
arraignment
alone
is
not
sufficient.
that
there
must
be
something
to
--
to
make
a
composite
and
we
do
not
think
the
state's
position
is
that
there
is
no
composite
available
here.
all
there
was,
was
the
delay.
additionally,
we
feel
that
the
pressures
that
were
exerted
against
this
defendant
as
opposed
to
the
kind
of
a
defendant
he
was,
and
i
do
feel
i
must
allude
briefly
to
some
of
his
testimony.
for
example,
“the
only
voluntary
statement
i
made
to
seeing
jimmy
bremmers
was
that
i
--
that
i
saw
some
children
playing
in
a
nice
yard
but
i
thought
one
of
them
might
have
been
him
but
i
gave
them
a
fabulous
story
on
that.
i
gave
them
a
fabulous
story
on
that
other.”
question,
mr.
triplett,
“do
you
have
any
reason
why
should
--
why
that
you,
under
serious
questioning
for
day
after
day
that
you
were
out
rather
easily?”
answer,
“well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
i
wore
out
too
easily.
i
put
a
few
of
the
big
boys
to
sleep
down
there
in
the
desk
after
i
got
on
the
desk.
after
i
got
down
to
cherokee,
they
appeared
to
take
this
tape
recording.
i
got
the
same
amount
of
sleep
there.”
“that's
right,
i'm
denying
everything
i
told
the
police.
now
if
you
want
the
truth,
have
doubts
there.”
“are
you
lying
now
or
when
you
talked
to
the
police?”
“i'm
sworn
in
here.
you're
not
going
to
get
me
for
perjury”.
we
think
that
this
shows
the
kind
of
a
personality
that
it's
going
to
take
considerable
pressure
to
be
exerted
on
to
take
it
to
have
deprived
of
him
his
--
of
him
--
him
of
his
rights
and
we
feel
further
that
the
only
pressure
that
was
exerted
was
this
half-hearted
almost
voluntary
custody
of
20
days.
thank
you.
mr.
freeman
h.
forrest
yes.
