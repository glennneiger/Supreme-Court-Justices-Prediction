m.

do
you
--
do
you
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
security
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
applied
to
mr.
lerner.
i
also
attack
it
generally
on
the
theory
that
there
was
no
national
emergency
which
would
have
justified
a
summary
discharge
of
employees
in
the
civil
service
at
a
time
in
1954,
when
mr.
lerner
was
discharged
when
there
was
no
national
emergency.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
it
have
to
be,
you
say,
(inaudible)
the
times
that
you
deal
with
national
emergency
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
and
so
it
states
in
the
preamble.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
with
security.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
availability
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
this
--
to
your
client
in
the
stay
inference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
your
position
turned
entirely
on
that
--
supposing
that
position
is
to
be
accepted?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
mean
in
breadth?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
assuming
that
you
would
plead
it
simply
or
state
it's
just
amendment
privilege
period,
would
you
then
say
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
detection
that
still
this
--
the
state
couldn't
use
that
anyway
it
wanted
to?
justice
john
m.
harlan
slochower
didn't
decide
anything
of
that
kind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
slochower
went
on
the
premise
that
the
use
of
a
--
the
use
of
a
--
of
a
claim
of
privilege
in
a
federal
investigation
knowing
for
it
being
made
by
the
state
without
giving
this
man
a
hearing
on
his
--
on
his
position
whether
he
could
hold
his
position
as
a
school
teacher
that
lacked
due
process,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
didn't
say
anything
as
to
how
far
the
privilege
could
be
used
as
evidence
that
the
state
court
used
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
think
about
the
terms.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
before
you
sit
down?
justice
john
m.
harlan
cut
through
this.
assuming
that
we
--
interpreter
--
one
interprets
these
opinions
as
meaning
that
he
was
discharged
because
he
claimed
his
fifth
amendment
rights
to
get
these
subtle
distinctions
as
it
is
to
me
that
you're
drawing.
and
he
was
discharged
because
taking
his
claim
of
privilege,
the
transit
authority
then
said,
“well,
we
regard
that
as
creating
a
doubt
in
our
mind.”
do
you
concede
you're
out
of
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
me
was
you
spent
so
much
time
arguing
this
question
as
to
whether
you
can
fragmentize
this
problem
down
to
what
would
have
happened
if
he
hadn't
claimed
these
fifth
amendment
rights
and
then
you
say
the
fifth
amendment
rights
is
just
surplusage
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
complaint.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
had
a
903
case
which
we
had
in
slochower
and
as
the
statute
said
that
if
the
state
employer
will
--
employee
will
be
discharged
if
he
claims
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
then
you
have
to
face
the
question
that
you've
been
trying
to
circle
around
with
don't
you?
