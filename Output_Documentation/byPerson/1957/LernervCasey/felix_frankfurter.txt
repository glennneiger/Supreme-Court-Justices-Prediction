justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
a
short
answer
to
one
that
was
given?
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
sustained
on
that
ground
but
they
--
they
went
to
the
constitutional
question
at
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
can't
take
or
recognize
on
a
specified
state
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
trial
is
within
the
power
of
state
courts
and
if
a
state
ground
isn't
available
the
rest
of
the
evidence
is
not
on
state
ground
to
include
us
in
the
decision
as
was
done
in
the
case
yesterday.
it's
a
very
different
thing
if
the
supreme
court
rules
in
the
majority
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
and
take
consideration
and
go
to
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
state
question.
that's
a
state
question.
but
the
other
one
isn't
a
state
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you'll
have
to
decide
whether
you're
right
or
the
other
side
is
right
in
what
the
state
law
is
(inaudible)
the
other
thing
is
not
subject
to
state
determination.
it's
a
state
law
from
which
if
the
state
court
does
what
it
did
here
and
those
are
the
federal
questions.
how
we
can
say
they
might
be
pointed
out
under
state
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
lack
of
procedure
by
--
in
which
he
was
(inaudible)
if
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
judgeable
as
such
if
he
did
and
why
aren't
these
--
why
is
the
question
for
us
to
be
considered
on
the
same
basis
as
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
court
of
appeals
justified
it
on
that
ground,
is
it
for
us
to
dig
out
some
other
state
ground
by
which
he
might
have
been
protected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
question
as
such
if
you've
stated
it
is
subject
to
the
scrutiny
under
the
federal
or
rather
the
relevant
federal
criteria,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
not
think
we
can
say
it
goes
well
in
any
event
you
might
have
protected
yourself
by
resorting
to
some
other
procedure
that
the
state
makes
available
which
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
invoke
as
a
ground
for
supporting
determination
of
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
then
the
--
the
right
to
that
--
the
right
to
that
in
terms
of
the
decision
of
the
court
to
--
it
makes
you
wonder
to
open
here
the
challenge
on
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
court
should
revers
the
court
of
appeals
would
the
statute
fall,
according
to
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
court
have
any
business
to
go
beyond
the
application
of
this
statute
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
any
interest
allowable
beyond
inference
that
he
has
made
a
choice
of
letting
the
employer
infer,
that
he
is
unquestionable
as
being
a
less
of
a
danger
than
the
danger
that
comes
from
--
that
comes
to
him
if
he
incurred
the
risk
by
answering
something
might
suggest
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
are
on
sound
ground
when
you
say
that
someone
might
make
that
inference.
not
that
that
is
allowable,
but
someone
might
make
that
inference.
and
therefore,
you
have
conceived
two
choices
with
which
we
have
to
offer
in
front
of
it
and
fronted
in
by
neither
of
which
is
desirable
or
possible
if
you
choose
the
lesser
as
we
can
say
all
the
time.
now,
the
lesser
one
is
that
he
will
take
the
risk
the
people
will
make
an
inference
adversely
on
him
on
reliability
rather
than
the
subversiveness
in
fact,
to
do
it
and
taking
the
risk,
that
the
employer
by
making
that
inference,
he
trusts
in
the
deeper
insight
of
the
employer
to
know
that
he's
untrustworthy
and
rather
not
trustworthy
men.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
must
--
in
your
position
i
don't
think
you
must
say
that
it
isn't
the
deprivation
of
any
constitutional
rights
of
the
employer
to
make
an
unreasonable
inference,
to
draw
an
unreasonable
inference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
logically
--
logically,
that's
what
it
must
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
just
because
a
man
doesn't
answer
the
question
that
means
that
it's
appropriate
to
call
him
unreliable
because
sometimes
it
is
and
sometimes
it
isn't.
it
all
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
who
is
asking
the
question,
what
business
he
has
to
ask
the
question
and
what
rule
or
frame
of
mind
that
he
should
be
asking
all
of
those
things
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
the
greatest
prize
of
counsel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
factually,
what
was
it?
factually,
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
what
you
said
judge
conway
said
in
plain
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
ground
of
his
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
ask
him
a
question
and
he
refuses
to
answer
that
it's
not
normal
in
the
situation
that
the
answer
that
you
and
i
often
will
use
that
before
they
had
the
affirmative
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
committing
myself
to
the
rightness
or
the
wrongness
as
judge
--
as
judge
conway
said
that
in
plain
english
words
in
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
nothing
in
--
there's
nothing
to
the
transit
authority
that
the
states
have
been
free
to
ask
the
questions
that
they
put
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
ask
what
was
in
there
if
you're
willing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
suppose
the
state
court
interpreted
the
state
authority
as
meaning
that
they
fired
him,
that
they
are
reading
of
their
document
of
dismissal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
you
can
come
here
and
ask
us
to
say
they
were
quite
wrong
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
unless
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
it.
(inaudible)
there
was
--
there
was
a
time
when
i
used
to
(inaudible)
suppose
a
charge
would
come
before
the
--
the
subway
authority
--
transit
authority
that
a
conductor
has
been
drunk,
suspected
of
taking
--
and
they
bring
him
before
the
appropriate
people
and
ask
whether
he
was
drunk
in
this
case
and
he
refuses
to
answer.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
the
authority
--
transit
authority
say
this
is
chargeable
and
no
more
is
what
i've
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
means
that
it
wouldn't
--
that
due
process
clause
of
the
united
states,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
bar
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
sustaining
the
transit
authority
from
finding
that
the
information
that
has
come
to
them
from
reliable
people
on
the
basis
of
which
they
ask
him
questions
whether
he
was
or
wasn't
drunk
isn't
“evidence
within
the
scope
of
that
statute.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
ever
to
be
a
violation
of
due
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
we
have
information
that
you've
been
drunk,
three
night
succession
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
you
please
tell
us
whether
your
(inaudible)
he
refused
to
answer
and
they
couldn't
discharge
him
under
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
evidence
isn't
evident
in
the
court
of
law,
this
court
had
held
in
all
the
immigration
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
evidence
in
the
--
the
jury
and
the
evidence
that's
required
doesn't
mean
the
usual
evidence
that
you
and
i
are
familiar
with
in
an
adversary
proceeding
in
a
court
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
say
that
wasn't
his
refusal
to
answer
it
left
what
information
they
had
as
evidence
it
means
i
can't
agree
that
this
court
would
hold
if
that's
a
violation
as
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
i
read
to
be
that
he
didn't
ask
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
chief
justice
conway
issued
the
claim
is
english
as
you
can
see
that
he
refused
to
answer,
an
evidence
(inaudible)
he
then
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
has
and
an
issue
for
saying
he
refused
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
destroy
the
validity
or
the
cause
of
the
first
statement
as
to
why
they
fired
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
they
said
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
because
they
never
--
did
they
infer
to
that
if
they
say
the
transit
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
isn't
a
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
the
highest
court
to
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
conway
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
there
the
courts
would
have
to
decide
whether
this
record
on
the
interpretation
given
by
the
highest
court
violates
some
of
the
portions
of
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
you
link
if
there
is
any
validity
in
that
opinion
that
you
file
the
full
text
in
their
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
have
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
want
to
ask
you
question,
mr.
boudin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
to
me,
is
very
important.
i
hope
i
hold
(inaudible)
to
you.
the
notes
of
deciding
a
particular
case,
not
some
public
cases
like
--
but
i
should
like
to
know
the
reach
of
this
to
this
court
to
make
a
decision.
and
i
would
like
you
to
ask
you
this
question,
not
termination
but
employment.
suppose
the
person
in
this
position
seeks
employment
and
he's
asking
questions.
they
refuse
to
answer.
and
the
record
is
clear
that
he
refused
employment
because
(inaudible)
and
i
think
it's
very
important
for
us
to
know
how
far
he's
going
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
mean
to
say
do
you
think,
the
state
new
york
would
say,
“we're
not
going
to
hire
either
a
jew
or
a
catholic
or
a
naturalized
citizen?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
it
could?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
doubt
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
the
state
of
new
york
refuses
to
hire
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
anybody
who
is
--
whoever
you
were,
a
democrat
or
a
republican?
justice
felix
frankfurter
