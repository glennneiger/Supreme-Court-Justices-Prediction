mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
the
court
pleases.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york.
the
court
has
that
we
serve
the
constitution
on
jurisdiction
in
the
court
i
would
address
myself
with
that
issue
after
i've
indicated
the
facts
from
the
statute
that
is
involved.
the
appellant,
max
lerner
is
a
subway
conductor
in
the
city
of
new
york.
he's
been
a
subway
conductor
for
21
years.
he
has
civil
service
status
and
he's
employed
by
a
corporation
created
by
the
state
of
new
york,
a
state
corporation
namely
the
new
york
city
transit
authority
of
which
the
appellees
are
the
members
to
which
i'll
refer
to
as
the
authority
or
the
appellee
as
the
case
maybe.
it
is,
of
course,
relevant
to
know
the
kind
of
job
that
we
are
dealing
with
for
various
reasons
that
appeared
to
have
had
constitutional
significance
occasionally.
and
then
i
have
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
record
on
page
6,
a
statement
which
is
necessarily
undisputed
since
this
comes
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
a
petition,
a
record
which
says
that
his
primary
duty,
reading
at
paragraph
10,
at
volume
10.
his
primary
duty
is
consistent
of
opening
and
closing
subway
car
doors
to
permit
the
entrance
and
exit
of
passengers
together
with
certain
routine
duties
incidental
thereto.
and
for
21
years,
mr.
lerner
pushed
a
button
which
opens
the
door
when
the
train
arrived
at
the
station
and
pushed
another
button
after
the
passengers
were
able
to
get
on
or
off
which
closed
the
doors.
those
are
the
duties
of
a
person
involved
in
this
litigation.
now,
mr.
lerner,
at
the
time
that
mr.
lerner
was
dismissed
by
the
new
york
city
transit
authority
under
the
security
risk
law,
which
i
shall
describe
in
detail
or
rather
there
were
also
in
effect
two
statutes
in
the
state
of
new
york
providing
for
the
dismissal
of
civil
service
employees.
one
of
the
statutes
was
section
22,
the
civil
service
law
which
provided
for
the
discharge
for
incompetency
or
misconduct.
and
the
other
statute
was
section
12
(a)
of
the
civil
service
law
which
this
court
notably
advocates
which
provided
for
the
discharge
for
membership
of
their
organization
to
the
proscribed
character.
but
there
is
significance
that
with
respect
to
12
(a)
as
this
court
noted
in
adler.
in
fact,
as
a
determining
factor
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
feinberg
law
that
12
(a)
requires
evidence
to
be
produced
against
the
person
who
was
charged
with
membership
in
the
proscribed
organization,
such
membership
on
the
12
(a)
to
be
--
take
--
it
takes
evidence
on
the
12
(a)
to
be
taken
in
open
court
with
the
witnesses
available
for
cross-examination.
now,
mr.
lerner,
my
client
was
not
discharged
under
12
(a)
and
he
was
not
discharged
under
section
22,
the
civil
service
law.
he
was
discharged
instead
under
the
security
risk
law
of
new
york,
a
statute
passed
in
1951.
that
statute
provides
for
the
summary
dismissal
of
people
who
were
described
as
security
risks
and
it
was
passed
because
of
the
korean
war
and
during
the
korean
war
in
1951.
it
was
passed
as
the
preamble
to
the
statute
indicates
as
the
government's
memorandum
indicates
as
the
statement
of
policy
in
section
1
indicates,
“in
aid
of
the
national
defense,
the
national
security.”
and
i
may
say
that
the
government's
message
indicates
an
aid
of
the
foreign
relations
policy
of
the
united
states,
a
state
law
with
those
federal
purposes.
and
the
statute
provides
for
collaboration
with
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
who
relies
upon
the
attorney
general's
listings
and
for
the
entrance
actually
of
contracts
for
mutual
operation
in
this
so-called
subversive
area
between
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
federal
government.
the
statute
provides
that
in
certain
jobs
described
as
sensitive
positions,
security
provisions
or
on
certain
agencies
which
are
security
agencies
so
to
be
designated
by
the
civil
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york,
employees
maybe
summarily
dismissed
by
a
procedure
which
i
will
indicate
but
i
should
say
first,
at
the
definition
of
security
agencies
and
security
positions
are
as
follows.
they
must
relate
--
the
employee
must
be
involved
in
functions
relevant
to
the
national
security,
i'm
paraphrasing,
or
he
must
have
something
to
do
with
presidential
information
relevant
to
the
national
security,
a
very
high
standard.
now,
in
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
with
security,
with
national
security.
but
i
may
say,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
while
i
will
address
myself
to
that
in
the
latter
part
of
my
argument,
the
facts
of
this
case
justified
my
relying
upon
the
slochower
decision
of
this
court
because
of
the
fact
that
the
inferences
that
we're
drawing
here
were
inferences
of
disloyalty
or
lack
of
security
or
being
the
security
risk
on
the
part
of
the
mr.
lerner
and
that
because
he
invoked
this
privilege,
a
fact
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment.
now,
the
security
risk
law
was
not
implemented
during
the
korean
conflict,
the
alleged
period
of
national
emergency.
instead,
it
was
not
until
1953
to
1954,
after
the
korean
conflict
ended
and
after
a
similarity
to
mr.
carroll's
case,
the
beilan
after
the
house
committee
on
un-
american
activities
came
to
new
york
that
--
that
the
civil
service
commission
began
naming
one
agency
after
another
and
one
job
after
another
as
security
agencies
or
security
jobs.
and
it
named
literally
60
agencies
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
state
of
new
york,
not
federal
agencies
but
city
and
state
agencies
as
agencies
or
positions
having
something
to
do
with
national
security.
hendricks
beats
my
principal
brief
set
forth
a
critical
memorandum
by
a
committee
of
the
government
of
new
york
on
that
particular
subject.
the
transit
authority,
the
appellee
here
was
named
as
a
security
agency
by
the
civil
service
commission
without
any
hearing,
without
any
notice
to
the
appellants
or
to
other
employees.
and
obviously,
without
any
reference
to
the
kind
of
job
that
appellant
had
as
a
subway
conductor.
now,
the
appellant
was
working
in
1954,
as
he
had
for
21
years
as
a
subway
conductor
until
he
received
that
an
--
an
instruction
to
appear
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation
of
the
city
of
new
york.
your
honors,
will
recall
my
statement,
my
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
this
is
a
state
corporation,
the
transit
authority,
not
a
city
corporation.
however,
the
commissioner
of
investigation
of
the
city
of
new
york
has
very
broad
powers
of
investigation
under
the
new
york
city
charter,
section
803.
he
may
examine
any
one
and
any
thing
which
may
relate
to
the
best
interest
of
the
city
in
his
opinion.
the
best
interest
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
it
has
been
judicially
held
that
he
may
even
examine
people
who
have
never
had
any
employment
with
the
city
of
new
york
as
commissioner
of
investigation.
his
powers
are
equivalent
to
those
of
a
congressional
committee
or
a
grand
jury.
he
can,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
witness
review
this
to
answer
in
the
unlimited
examinations
that
can
held
and
that
are
held
under
section
803
of
the
city
charter,
803
not
903,
of
course.
he
may
go
into
court
and
he
may
ask
the
court
to
hold
the
witness
in
contempt.
and
of
course,
your
honors
will
recall
the
similarity
to
the
rogers
situation
if
a
witness
were
in
this
particular
situation
to
answer
questions
about
himself
that
the
commission
of
investigation,
he
would
find
that
he
had
waived
his
privilege
and
would
have
to
answer
questions
about
other
people,
a
very
different
point,
situation
as
i
will
indicate
in
a
so
that
was
to
confront
the
employee
who
was
asked
by
his
employer
to
execute
an
affidavit
with
respect
to
himself
garner
as
an
example.
now,
mr.
lerner,
came
before
the
commission
of
investigation
on
two
occasions
in
september
and
october
of
1954
and
was
asked
whether
he
was
then,
or
rather
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
he
said,
"i
decline
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
my
constitutional
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution."
mr.
lerner
was
told
by
the
commission
of
investigation
on
these
two
occasions
taking
them
as
one,
the
following,
(a)
we
will
not
tell
you
whether
there
are
any
charges
against
you
and
this
is
not
as
employer
to
the
commissioner.
(b)
this
is
an
investigation
under
the
security
risk
law
of
new
york.
(c)
if
you
do
not
answer
our
questions,
by
the
way
he
was
put
under
oath,
you
will
be
discharged
under
section
903
of
the
--
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
now,
the
commissioner
might
have
pardoned
for
errors
of
the
law
because
this
court
didn't
hand
down
the
slochower
case,
until
a
year
and
a
quarter
later.
but
he
couldn't
be
pardoned
for
his
misconstruction
of
the
charter
since
mr.
lerner
was
not
an
employee
of
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
lerner
stood
on
his
privilege
that
when
he
went
back
to
his
employer,
he
received
a
letter
from
his
employer
which
appears
in
the
record
and
that
that
letter
says
as
follows.
“you
appeared
before
the
commission
of
investigation.”
i'm
referring
now
to
page
8
--
page
10.
“you
appeared
before
the
commission
of
investigation,
and
when
asked
whether
or
not
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
you
declined
to
answer
and
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
therefore,
we
regard
this
as
evidence
of
unreliability
under
the
security
risk
law
and
you
are
suspended
and
given
an
opportunity
to
answer
if
you
wish.”
and
was
obviously
no
point
in
answering.
the
fact
was
not
in
dispute.
that
is
the
fact
that
he
had
stated
his
privilege
before
the
commissioner
of
investigation.
there
were
no
other
charges
against
him
except
the
fact
that
he
had
stated
the
privilege,
he
didn't
answer
and
the
next
response
was
a
letter
of
discharge.
and
that
letter
of
discharge
is
accompanied
by
a
resolution
on
page
14
of
the
record
which
is
quite
interesting.
first,
it
incorporates
by
reference
to
the
prior
letter,
his
invocation
of
his
constitutional
privilege
and
concludes
that
he
had
given
by
the
invocation
of
the
privilege,
evidence
that
he
is
a
security
risk
under
the
security
risk
law
of
new
york.
that
is
point
one
of
our
brief
point
two.
secondly,
it
adds
and
may
i
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
14
of
the
record,
further
investigation
has
revealed
activities.
i
emphasize
the
word
activities
on
the
part
of
max
lerner
which
give
reasonable
ground
for
a
belief
that
he
is
not
a
good
security
risk
and
he's
been
recommended
that
he'd
be
terminated
and
he
was
terminated.
now,
we
are
arguing
this
case
before
your
honors
in
1958
and
we
have
never
yet
been
told
what
we've
never
seen
in
the
evidence.
we
had
never
been
told
what
those
further
activities
are.
we
still
do
not
know
that
he
may
have
(inaudible)
to
the
further
activities.
mr.
lerner,
then
instituted
action
in
the
state
supreme
court
by
petition.
the
petition
appears
at
the
opening
pages
of
the
record,
pages
5
to
9
and
that
petition
has
fact
which
i
have
recited
and
which
are
not
challenged
before
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
petition,
the
privilege
of
a
complaint
was
made
in
the
court
below.
it
was
made
in
the
lowest
court.
when
we
appeared
in
the
lowest
court
of
the
state,
your
honors,
will
remember
this
is
pre-slocowher,
pre-slocowher.
there
was
a
candor
on
the
part
of
the
transit
authority
which
was
truly
admirable.
they
admitted
and
they
agreed
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
here
and
it's
stated
that
they
discharged
him
because
they
drew
from
his
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
fact
that
he
was
a
security
risk
right
due
the
inference
which
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to
in
footnote
9
of
his
dissenting
opinion
in
konigsberg.
they
do
the
inference
with
mr.
justice
burton,
said
could
not
be
drawn
in
the
slochower
case
from
the
mere
section
of
privilege.
they
expressly
said
and
at
the
page
5
of
my
brief,
i
have
set
it
forth
in
my
reply
brief,
the
test
established
by
the
security
risk
law
has
been
met
in
this
case,
in
the
instant
case.
surely
it
cannot
be
said
that
it's
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
a
man
who
refused
to
reply
on
the
ground
of
possible
of
self-incrimination,
when
asked
point
blank
about
membership
of
the
communist
party,
not
a
political
party,
but
a
subversive
organization
is
a
proper
person
to
have
in
a
security
agency.
and
then
if
your
honors,
will
turn
to
page
13
of
my
reply
brief,
you
will
see
what
the
--
what
they
said
there
and
oddly
enough
the
italicized
words
at
the
bottom
of
page
15
of
my
reply
brief,
are
their
appellants
in
the
court
below
because
one
of
the
italicized
words,
“on
the
ground
that
his
answers
might
incriminate
him.”
in
short,
they
drew
the
inference
in
1954
which
this
court
in
1956
said
could
not
be
drawn
for
the
invocation
of
the
privilege.
and
indeed
they
draw
the
explicit
inference
which
some
of
the
dissenting
members
of
this
court
said
could
not
be
joined
in
the
slochower
case
because
it
wasn't
clear,
possibly,
to
some
members
of
the
court
what
the
inference
withdrawn
in
the
slochower
and
was
perfectly
clear
what
was
on
here.
now,
when
this
case
therefore
came
to
the
state
supreme
court,
mr.
justice
brennan
agreed
that
the
inference
could
be
drawn
here
as
to
unreliability
under
the
statutes.
he
was
much
less
concerned
with
the
argument
now
made
on
appeal
that
is
the
garner
situation
which
i'll
distinguish
in
the
court
shortly.
he
said,
“there
is
no
dispute.”
and
i
refer
to
page
18
of
the
record.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
petitioner
asserted
the
constitutional
privilege.
that
was
a
significant
thing
for
the
court
at
special
term.
and
he
said
later
on
at
page
24
of
the
record
with
respect
to
our
contention
which
he
dismissed.
he
contends,
talking
about
my
client,
at
the
assertion
of
his
constitutional
privilege,
cannot
be
regarded
as
reasonable
grounds
for
belief
that
he
was
of
doubtful
trust
and
reliability.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
determination
of
that
question
rests
solely
with
the
authority
since
the
statute
vests
actual
discretion
in
the
security
agency
to
decide
that
issue,
namely,
whether
the
assertion
of
a
privilege
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
brennan
is
grounds
for
inferring
unreliability.
and
he
thereafter
referred
to
section
903
of
the
new
york
city
charter
as
yet
unanalyzed
by
this
court.
and
he
referred
to
article
1,
section
6
of
the
--
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
reading
it
erroneously
as
i'll
indicate
if
the
need
there
be,
both
dealing
with
the
invocation
of
the
privilege.
so
far
therefore
as
mr.
justice
brennan
is
concerned
and
the
appellees
were
concerned,
this
was
a
discharge
in
which
they
concluded
as
an
invocation
of
a
privilege,
not
a
failure
to
disclose
to
an
employer.
we'll
discuss
that
in
the
afternoon.
if
invocation
of
the
privilege
show
that
he
was
an
unreliable
man,
show
that
underneath
it
was
something
there
which
they
can
conclude
actually
existed.
shall
i
proceed?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
in
addition
to
this
slochower
case,
i,
of
course,
rely
upon
the
konigsberg
case
because
in
konigsberg,
this
court
said
that
you
could
not
draw
up
an
inference
of
unreliability
where
a
person
refused
to
answer
a
question
in
this
area,
presumably
in
some
other
areas,
relying
in
good
faith
upon
a
constitutional
claim.
that
the
court
was
not
dealing,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
footnote,
was
not
dealing
with
the
constitutional
privilege.
but
certainly
if
the
court
was
--
if
that
is
the
law,
as
i
trust
it
is,
that
the
assertion
of
a
first
amendment
right
and
other
rights
is
not
a
ground
for
inferring
guilt
so
the
same
rule
must
apply
to
this
situation.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
decisions
of
this
court
in
slochower,
the
appellees
immediately
turned
their
position
before
the
appellate
division
in
a
supplemental
brief
in
the
court
below.
and
thereafter,
the
court
of
appeals
are
now
here
into
a
complete
forgetfulness
as
to
the
reason
given
by
them
by
which
they
are
court-bound
for
the
original
discharge,
a
complete
forgetfulness
as
to
the
inference
that
was
drawn
and
they
attempted
to
assimilate
this
case,
therefore,
to
garner
moving
back.
now,
the
distinction
between
garner
and
our
case
may
be
set
forth
as
follows.
in
garner,
there
was
a
precise
disclosure
statute.
in
this
case,
there
is
not
a
disclosure
statute
precise
or
otherwise.
in
this
case,
there
is
an
evidentiary
statute,
that
is
a
statute
stating
that
upon
certain
kinds
of
evidence,
so-called,
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
few
minutes,
evidence
of
unreliability,
the
employee
may
be
discharged
and
we
would
take
the
position
here
that
whatever
may
be
the
duty
of
the
employee
of
a
state
employer
under
a
statute
possibly
under
a
regulation,
i
don't
have
to
meet
that
issue,
under
a
statute
stating
that
you
must
disclose.
although,
we're
not
saying
what
consequences
might
be,
either
way.
the
situation
is
different
where
the
state
is
required
to
prove
its
case
by
evidence
and
that
garner
is
simply
inapplicable.
now,
in
the
appellate
division
while
garner
appears,
referred
to
very
frequently
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
while
garner
is
also
referred
to
very
frequently,
actually
neither
court,
being
a
judicial
body,
wanted
to
or
was
able
to
get
away
completely
from
the
precise
reason
given
by
the
appellees
for
the
discharge,
namely,
the
inference
that
was
drawn
from
the
assertion
of
the
privilege.
and
so,
said
the
appellate
division
at
page
35
of
the
record
repeated
thereafter,
“it's
true
we
may
not
infer
that
appellant
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
from
the
decision
of
the
privilege.
on
the
other
hand,”
and
i
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
“on
the
other
hand,”
“on
the
other
hand,
we
are
required
to
and
should
accept
this
truthful,
his
statements
of
answers
to
the
questions
propounded
might
have
tended
to
incriminate
him.”
in
other
words,
they
will
not
draw
the
inference,
but
they
will
draw
the
inference.
otherwise,
the
sentence
has
no
meaning.
and
thereafter,
the
appellate
division,
the
court
of
appeals
said
at
page
63
of
the
record
--
pardon
me,
it's
page
--
yes,
63
and
64.
when
the
employee
refuses
to
tell
his
employer
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
surely
he
is
giving
evidence
of
reasonable
grounds
for
doubt
as
to
whether
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said
in
the
special
term
opinion,
“he
might
be
a
member.
he
is
giving
reasonable
grounds
for
doubt
as
to
his
trustworthiness
and
reliability
as
a
security
risk.”
and
as
we
say,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
the
opinion
in
slochower
and
indeed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
slochower
to
the
extent
that
they
moved
along
on
the
issue
do
not
accept
as
justifiable,
as
consistent
with
due
process,
the
inference
of
unreliability
which
all
the
courts
below
as
well
as
the
appellees
drew
in
the
situation.
now,
there
is
one
other
reason
why
this
is
not
garner,
citing
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
disclosure
situation.
there
is
a
radical
difference,
as
i
suggested
before
in
my
statement
of
the
facts,
between
the
employer,
who,
as
this
court
believe,
has
a
duty,
has
a
right
to
ask
his
employees
certain
questions
about
his
own
employees'
record
and
the
kind
of
investigating
official
that
the
commissioner
of
investigation
of
the
city
of
new
york
is.
there
are
two
points
that
i
am
now
making.one
is,
the
commission
of
investigation
is
not
the
transit
authority.
he's
a
part
of
a
different
government.
and
the
second
thing
is
that
the
commissioner
of
investigation
has
a
broad
sweeping
power
and
this
would
be
an
extension
of
garner.
this
would
mean
giving
a
--
an
investigating
official
the
power
to
ask
the
people
about
other
people
and
ask
the
details
about
one's
life,
because
in
large
part
of
the
waiver
doctrine
that
will
be
implicit
in
the
witnesses
and
to
ask
to
himself
in
answer
that
he
could
very
reasonably
give
to
his
employer
without
the
slightest
danger.
now,
what
do
they
say
about
the
commissioner
of
investigation?
in
our
petition,
we
have
--
we
pointed
out
that
the
investigation
was
initiated.
i
hope
the
court
will
remember
my
word
initiated
at
the
instructions
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
who
told
the
commissioner
of
investigation
to
investigate
a
number
of
employees
in
various
agencies.
the
city
of
new
york
was
the
lessor,
a
lessor
of
a
physical
property
of
the
transit
authority
and
it
is
because
the
city
was
a
lessor
that
they
argued
below
that
the
city
had
a
right
to
have
its
commissioner
call
the
employees
of
the
transit
authority
and
we
disputed
that
and
we
lost
in
the
court
below.
what
we
did
we
lost
in
the
court
below
on
a
ground
that
we
cannot
argue
here,
namely
that
the
city
charter
gives
the
commissioner
certain
jurisdiction
to
investigate
virtually
anything
he
wants
to
in
--
under
the
--
under
the
standard
of
the
best
interests
of
the
city.
but
the
fact
that
he
has
power
of
the
city
charter
to
investigate
an
employee
of
the
transit
authority
or
a
person
who
was
not
employed
by
any
agency
of
government
at
all
does
not
make
him
the
employer.
he
is
still
not
the
employer
of
appellant
and
this
was
recognized.
again,
it's
--
it's
the
second
thing
that
the
appellees
have
forgotten
since
the
original
argument
in
the
state
supreme
court.
this
was
recognized
in
the
state
supreme
court
by
the
appellees
and
by
mr.
justice
brennan
with
special
terms,
because
the
appellees
pointed
out
in
the
state
supreme
court
that
this
had
been
initiated
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation
and
they
said
there's
no
reason
why
the
commission
of
investigation
can't
make
available
to
the
transit
authority
anything
in
his
possession
and
that
the
transit
authority
cannot
use
whatever
the
commissioner
gives
it,
in
the
same
way
that
it
could
use
evidence
coming
from
a
congressional
committee.
and
i
refer
your
honors
to
page
8
of
my
reply
brief
where
this
quotation
is
set
forth.
it
is
submitted
and
i'll
only
read
the
first
line
that
under
the
security
risk
law,
the
authority
may
consider
and
weigh
evidence
from
any
source
whether
it
be
from
the
commission
of
investigation,
the
police
department,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
or
evidence
of
testimony
before
any
legislative
or
congressional
committee.
now,
it
may
be
that
they
can
consider
anything
they
get,
what
all
this
proves
is,
at
the
commission
of
investigation
was
treated
by
the
transit
authority,
not
as
their
agents
authorized
by
the
transit
authority
to
act
as
an
employer
or
the
place
of
the
employer,
but
as
a
source
of
information
which
anybody
including
a
grand
jury
or
congressional
committee
might
have
made
available
to
the
--
to
the
transit
authority.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
shall
do
so
now.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
analyzing
this
statute.
if
your
honor
will
recall
my
emphasis
on
the
federal
character
of
the
proceeding
of
the
federal
purposes
of
the
state
laws
that
my
client
had
a
right
to
treat
this
as
a
federal
proceeding,
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
purpose
of
the
activities
of
the
commission
of
investigation
was
to
aide
the
national
defense
program.
now,
if
the
court
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
then,
i
--
i
treat
this
as
a
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
not
necessarily
onto
the
fifth,
but
the
constitutional
privilege
in
breadth
and
that
was
i
think
how
the
courts
below
treated
her.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
mean
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
other
courts
did
not
distinguish
between
the
constitutional
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
constitutional
privilege
in
the
self-incrimination
under
the
state
constitution.
they
were
treating
this
as
if
the
witness
had
come
before
a
state
body
and
was
pleading
whatever
privilege
he
possessed
against
self-incrimination.
and
if
that
is
the
case,
then
we
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
commission
of
investigation
was
a
federal
body
or
a
sapient
body.
we
still
had
the
right
not
to
be
discharged
by
the
transit
authority
because
the
commissioner,
a
different
--
a
different
group
of
people
decided
to
ask
questions
and
because
we
pleaded
the
privilege
before
the
commissioner.
now,
however,
we
are
the
ones
who
have
said
that
in
addition
to
the
state
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
cannot
be
used
by
the
transit
authority
as
the
grounds
--
as
evidence
of
disloyalty,
in
addition
to
that,
we
say
that
because
the
commission
of
investigation
was
acting
as
a
federal
agent,
this
was
precisely
as
if
we
had
asserted
the
constitutional
privilege
before
a
federal
body.
and
therefore,
a
right
to
assert
it
was
not
only
comprehended
within
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
a
right
to
assert
it
was
an
immunity
and
privilege
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
that
if
we
set
it
our
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
whether
we
pleaded
our
state
privilege
or
our
federal
privilege,
the
--
the
drawing
of
an
inference
that
the
assertion
of
either
privilege
was
evidence
of
disloyalty
or
possible
disloyalty
will
be
arbitrary
action
within
the
definition
of
slochower,
but
slochower
did
not
depend
of
course
upon
the
tribunal
before
which
it
was,
this
too
was
dependent
and
brought
upon
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
responsible
employer.
but
the
immunities
and
privileges
point
in
slochower
is
not
passed
upon
the
court
as
your
honor
recalls.
in
short,
i
say
that
when
you
assert
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
whether
you
say
under
state
law
or
do
you
stay
under
federal
law,
whether
you
say
on
the
state
law
because
you
regard
the
state
privilege
is
broad
enough
to
protect
you,
murdock,
not
withstanding,
against
the
danger
of
incrimination
under
federal
law,
no
matter
how
you
plead
it,
it
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
under
slochower
for
that
plea
of
the
privilege
to
be
treated
as
evidence
of
disloyalty.
now,
my
argument
that
this
is
a
federal
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
slochower
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
--
i've
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
your
honor
please,
i
believe
that
the
reference
made
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
clark
for
the
fact
that
he
sent
us
the
-
-the
inference
was
drawn
and
could
not
be
drawn
from
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
to
control
this
case
and
that
they
sent
us
the
inference
has
been
drawn
in
the
present
case
from
the
invocation
of
the
privilege.
and
if
i
may
illustrate
that
by
reference
to
the
statute
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
that
the
sentence
--
the
inference
cannot
be
drawn,
mr.
justice
clark,
no
matter
who
is
asking
the
question.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
then
you
get
the
question
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
quite
true.
you
would
then
have
that
the
insubordination
problem
would
arise
if
you
had
a
--
an
employer
asking
the
question
and
a
clear
duty
imposed
upon
the
employee
either
by
statute
or
if
this
court
would
hold
as
a
matter
of
the
relationship.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
would
be
the
gist,
that's
right,
correct.
and
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
the
employer
asking
the
question.
we
have
a
city
agency
asking
the
question
and
the
employer
saying
that
that
is
evidence
upon
reliability.
and
may
i
come
down
to
one
more
point
but
i
will,
of
course,
proceed
further
on
this
if
i'm
asked
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
dual
reason
for
the
discharge.
your
honors
may
recall
my
stating
that
the
original
letter
of
suspension
merely
referred
to
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
but
the
discharge
letter
referred
to
other
activities
and
there
was
never
a
hearing
on
those
other
activities.
there
was
never
an
elucidation
about
those
--
other
activities
were.
and
so,
we
say
that
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
let
me,
because
i
would
not
want
to,
even
in
the
short
time,
i'm
leading
for
my
main
argument,
avoid
the
constitutional
--
the
jurisdictional
issue.
the
jurisdictional
issue
was
raised
by
appellees
unless
they
developed
it
further,
in
which
case
i
can
respond
to
what
seems
to
be
this.
that
the
appellant
should
have
gone
to
the
civil
service
commission
on
an
appeal,
rather
to
have
gone
into
the
state
supreme
court
for
review
of
the
transit
authority's
action.
this
is
really
an
argument
of
the
non-exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
answers
such
as
for
example
the
appellees'
acquiescence
in
the
courts
below
on
this
particular
way
of
testing
the
constitutional
problems
involved
and
the
fact
of
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
here
provides
that
when
we
go
to
the
commission,
if
we
do,
not
to
say
what
happens
when
we
don't.
we
can
never
appeal
to
the
courts,
so
said
the
statute.
we
have
the
right
to
take
the
statute
as
its
worth,
but
there
is
a
real
and
finally
there's
a
principle
in
new
york
administrative
law
which
i
cited
in
one
of
my
earlier
briefs,
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
that
you
have
a
choice
normally
of
going
either
to
the
highest
administrative
body
in
the
state
or
going
into
the
courts.
if
you
go
into
the
courts,
you
have
a
greater
power
of
review
than
if
you
go
to
the
highest
administrative
body.
but
the
real
answer,
the
answer
that
i
might
have
given
at
the
beginning
of
this
discussion
is
this.
we
raised
all
the
federal
constitutional
issues
in
the
lower
courts
including
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
other
courts
decided
those
issues.
the
question
that
this
court
has
said
so
often
of
whether
or
not
federal
issues
are
raised
as
a
matter
normally
of
federal
--
of
state
court
procedure
and
the
state
court
was
perfectly
satisfied
as
were
the
appellees
up
to
recently
to
have
the
issues
decided
by
it.
now,
i
want
to
turn
in
possibly
two
minutes
of
my
final
discussion
to
the
other
points
that
i
made
in
the
brief,
because
while
i
think
that
the
issue
can
be
determined
by
the
slochower
and
konigsberg
principles,
now,
i
may
say,
if
i
must
mr.
justice
harlan,
by
footnote
9
even
though,
your
honor,
is
not
concluded
that's
one
of
the
position
to
the
konigsberg
decision.
i
want
to
point
out
in
point
(4)
of
our
brief,
we
take
the
position
that
the
state
cannot
decide
that
an
employee
can
be
discharged
for
membership
in
an
organization
even
if
it'd
be
the
communist
party,
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
emergency
situation
which
we
justify
such
drastic
action.
and
that
in
1954,
we
submit,
there
was
no
emergency
which
would
justify
the
discharge
of
an
employee
of
the
state
of
new
york,
subway
conductor,
a
humble
man,
opening
and
closing
doors
or
not
and
as
if
even
if
he
had
joined
the
communist
party,
even
if
he
was
then
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
is
certainly
with
no
emergency,
which
call
for
the
discharge
of
a
man
for
stating
the
constitutional
privilege.
now,
it
may
be
asked
whether
we
ever
reach
this
point
and
the
reason
why
it
is
conceivable
we
reach
it,
if
i
fail
to
prevail
on
the
other
points,
is
that
we
were
discharged
not
for
nondisclosure
as
in
garner,
but
discharged
because
there
was
evidence
of
unreliability.
and
we
may
just
as
well
take
the
maximum
of
the
evidence
and
say,
“the
inferences
were
drawn
that
he
was
or
might
have
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
so,
if
your
honors
disagree
with
me
on
the
earlier
points
which
i
have
made,
we
may
be
faced
with
the
question
a
kind
of
discharge
for
inferred
membership
in
the
communist
party
be
valid
if
the
employee
is
a
subway
conductor
in
the
city
of
new
york,
not
the
federal
government
waging
the
war,
if
the
year
is
1954
and
if
his
duties
are
the
duties
which
have
been
described
incontrovertible
in
the
petition.
they
add
a
few
more
duties
in
their
appendix
to
their
brief
which
your
honors,
i
don't
think,
can
consider
as
part
of
this
record,
namely,
that
the
subway
conductor
might
go
on
the
tracks
because
he
has
a
badge.
well,
i
submit
that
without
a
badge,
the
millions
of
passengers
who
travel
on
the
new
york
subway
system
can
do
exactly
the
same
kind
of
theoretical
damage
that
is
suggested
here
and
can
go
on
tracks
and
go
into
washrooms
and
control
the
same
number
of
bonds
as
a
subway
conductor
can
possibly
do.
subway
conductor,
who
i
may
say,
from
this
complaint,
have
the
presumption
of
--
of
good
conduct
above
the
average
train
passenger
because
of
his
record
as
a
loyal
employee
for
21
years,
i
did
not
indicate
anything
further
on
that
point.
i
will
withhold
if
i
may
be
clarified.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
difficulty
is
that
we
have
been
hearing
the
discussion
in
the
last
few
minutes
from
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
is
--
is
not
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
situation
that
it's
not
in
this
case.
i
remind
the
court
what
i
probably
failed
to
do
in
sufficient
detail
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument
that
the
language
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
as
chief
--
judge
fuld
points
out
in
the
court
below
and
indeed
as
judge
(inaudible)
points
out
in
the
appellate
division
below,
both
dissenting.
the
language
of
the
statute
requires
evidence,
evidence
of
unreliability.
that
your
honors
will
look
at
the
statute
as
i
trust
will
be
done
eventually,
your
honors,
will
see
that
the
statutes
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
in
--
at
page
34
of
my
principal
brief.
it
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
33.
it
requires
that
the
body
which
suspends
or
discharges,
the
top
of
page
34
i'm
reading,
mr.
justice
black,
shall
find
after
proper
investigation
and
inquiry
that
upon
all
the
evidence,
reasonable
grounds
exist
for
belief
that
because
of
doubtful
trust
and
reliability,
the
employment
et
cetera
would
endanger
the
security
of
the
nation
and
the
state.
now,
that
is
a
--
an
evidentiary
statute.
that
does
nothing
to
do
with
the
disclosure.
i
--
the
discussion
was
quite
interesting,
but
i
think
theoretical
because
we
are
dealing
here
what
a
statute
requiring
evidence.
and
when
the
transit
authority
proceeded
against
max
lerner,
the
appellant
here,
they
did
not
fire
him
for
insubordination,
a
very
easy
word
to
use
or
for
violation
of
his
obligation,
a
very
easy
word
--
phrase
to
use.
they
discharged
him
as
the
record
shows
at
record
10
and
record
14,
they
suspended
him
because
of
his
invocation
of
the
privilege
and
they
discharged
him
for
the
other
reason
as
well,
namely,
the
activities
which
were
never
specified.
but
this
argument
about
a
disclosure
would
be
reasonable
if,
(a)
there
were
a
disclosure
statute
and
(b),
more
important
i
think
or
as
important
as
the
nonexistence
of
disclosure
statute.
the
state
was
proceeding
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
evidence
being
required.
this
court
never
said
in
garner
that
evidence
had
anything
which
required
except
the
noncompliance
with
the
obligation
to
take
the
oath
in
the
garner
situation.
this
statute
requires
evidence
and
everyone
treated
the
invocation
of
the
privilege
as
evidence.
now,
we
are
told
here
that
mr.
--
mr.
judge
conway's
remarks
may
be
construed
as
suggesting
that
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employee,
but
we
are
not,
with
all
do
respect,
concerned
really
with
what
the
judges
below
said
as
to
the
reason
for
the
discharge.
if
the
transit
authority
as
inclusive
here,
they
said
they
fired
my
client
because
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
they
are
bound
by
it
and
if
that
is
a
violation
of
due
process,
no
level
of
judicial
decision
below,
i
say
below,
can
deprive
my
client
of
a
due
process.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
why,
of
course,
the
original
suspension
order
says,
“refused
to
answer
and
invoked
the
fifth.”
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
the
statement,
“invoked
the
fifth”
can't
be
surplusage.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course
it's
in
there,
but
it's
coupled
at
each
point
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
with
the
invocation
of
the
fifth.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
i
could
come
here
if
they
--
if
they
said
--
let
me
finish
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
you
please,
if
they
have
stated
that
it's
refusal
to
answer
was
evidence
of
being
a
security
risk.
in
other
words,
i'm
not
withdrawing
from
the
basic
position
i
take
here
that
they
discharged
him
provoking
the
fifth.
they
did
it.
they
set
it
in
the
supreme
court
below
and
nothing
can
avoid
that.
but
suppose
we
didn't
even
have
the
fifth
here.
i
would
then
be
before
this
court
and
say
that
the
refusal
to
answer,
the
naked
refusal
to
answer
would
not
be
evidence
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
and
i'm
sure.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
could
--
i'll
answer
you
completely.
they
could
not
discharge
him
under
security
risk
law
which
requires
evidence
of
unreliability.
they
might
have
made
a
charge
against
him
in
the
particular
case
you
indicate
with
respect
to
insubordination,
but
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
was
not
done
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
your
honor,
means
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
--
that
his
refusal
to
answer?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
will
say
to
your
honor,
that
in
my
view
of
the
due
process
clause
with
all
due
respect,
they
could
not
say,
that
he
was
discharged
because
his
answer
was
evident
that
he
had
done
any
such
thing
if
they
were
to
discharge
him
because
of
their
basic
common
law
power
assuming
that
they
have
his
employer
for
insubordination
for
the
violation
of
the
duty
imposed
upon
the
employee,
accidental
problems.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
think,
your
honor
has
that
problem
to
consider
here
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
because
we
have
a
--
an
explicit
statement
that
the
reason
for
discharge
was
the
invocation
of
the
fifth.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
which
the
transit
authority
read
below
its
--
read
below
to
me
that
he
invoked
the
constitutional
privilege.
why,
if
they
discharged
him
only
for
his
refusal
to
answer
for
this
obligation,
why
did
they
consider
that,
not
only
reasonable
grounds
for
inferring
that
he
might
have
been
a
member
the
communist
party.
but
why
do
they
say
in
the
courts
below,
we
call
your
honor's
attention
the
court
with
the
special
term
that
section
903
of
the
city
charter
which
refers
to
the
invocation
of
the
privilege.
we'll
call
your
honors'
attention
to
article
1,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
which
refers
to
the
invocation
of
the
privilege.
they
made
this
a
privilege
case.
we
didn't.
and
then
it's
because
they
made
it,
your
honor
that
i
am
--
no
point
is
necessary
to
answer
the
hypothetical
situation
which
is
suggested.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
then
if
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
would
also
read,
justice
--
judge
conway's
opinion
about
the
part
beginning
on
the
bottom
of
page
63,
to
the
top
of
64,
where
he
considered
this
to
be
evidence
of
reasonable
grounds
for
unreliability
and
this
does
not
discuss
the
obligation
of
the
employer
and
employee.
and
i
should
also
say
to
your
honor,
if
your
honor
will
read
the
dissenting
opinions
of
judge
fuld
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--and
of
van
voorhis.
now,
may
i
add
one
more
point
in
direct
response
to
your
honor's
questions.
let's
assume
that
the
transit
authority
came
here
today
and
said,
“yes,
we
fired
him
as
we
said
in
the
lowest
court
below
because
we
believe
he
was
a
communist.
we
fired
him
because
we
drew
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
when
he
asserted
his
constitutional
privilege.”
that's
what
they
said
in
the
lowest
court
below.
and
let
us
assume
that
judge
conway
had
said,
“we
will
regard
this
as
a
firing,
despite
what
the
transit
authority
said
as
a
firing
for
nondisclosure.”
i
think,
your
honors
would
accept
the
admission
made
by
the
transit
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
transit
authority?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
they
always
said
he
refused
to
answer,
of
course,
your
honor,
but
always.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
no.
i
understand.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
i
understand
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
understand.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
filed
with
your
honors,
a
copy
of
their
brief
in
the
lowest
state
court
and
i'm
satisfied
for
you
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think,
your
honors
should
know
that,
of
course,
i
have
already
filed
the
full
text
of
their
brief.
i'm
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
yes.
i
have
filed
the
full
text
of
their
briefs
in
the
lower
state
court.
i
have
not
given
this
court,
just
excerpts
from
the
brief.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please
do.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
know
of
any
statutory
or
constitutional
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
hire
anyone
at
all.
i
think
it
has
absolute
power
in
terms
of
deciding
whom
to
hire.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
i
don't
speak
of
it
so
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
have
no
--
i
do
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
i
do
not
know
whether
it
could.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
--
well,
whenever
the
court
says
and
when
whether
--
and
whatever
counsels
give
the
examples
of
a
jew
or
catholic
obviously,
we
have
an
extreme
position
which
apparently
control
no
other
rules
of
law.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
will
agree
that
if
a
jew
or
catholic
would
present
an
extreme
situation
and
yet,
it
might
be
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
refuse
to
hire
even
that
kind
of
person.
i
don't
know.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
know
whether
there
are
any
limitations
on
the
power
of
the
--
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
hire.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
i'm
not
--
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
discuss
that
issue.
i
do
know
only
one
thing
why
mr.
lerner
was
discharged.
and
i
rely
for
that
upon
their
admissions.
i
thank
your
honors.
