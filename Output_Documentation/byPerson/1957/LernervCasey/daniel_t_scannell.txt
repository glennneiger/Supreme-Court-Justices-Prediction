mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
before
the
court
a
challenge
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
security
risk
law
of
state
of
the
new
york,
both
as
it
is
written
and
applied.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
korean
crisis
or
the
korean
war
did
cause
the
new
york
state
legislature
to
come
in
to
action.
now,
it's
also
true
that
they
were
concerned
with
the
defense
and
security
of
the
nation,
but
what
mr.
boudin
forgot
to
mention
is
they
also
said
they
were
concerned
with
the
defense
and
security
of
the
state
as
well.
i
may
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
was
time
to
take
a
look
at
the
public
employees
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
determine
whether
there
were
any
such
employees
who
were
members
of
subversive
organizations
or
employees
who,
because
of
doubtful
trust
and
reliability,
should
be
removed
from
certain
security
positions
or
security
agencies.
that
was
the
objective
of
the
legislature.
and
the
legislature
in
setting
up
the
machinery
in
the
act
provided
that
the
state
civil
service
commission
should
determine
which
agencies
would
be
security
agencies
and
they
setup
certain
norms
that
the
agency
would
have
to
do
with
jobs
which
had
a
--
a
relationship
to
the
security
of
the
nation
and
the
state
or
where
confidential
information
having
the
same
relationship
was
handled.
they
further
provided
that
in
the
event
the
agency
as
such
was
not
found
to
be
of
such
a
character,
that
there
maybe
certain
jobs
in
that
agency
which
would
be
of
that
character
and
they
would
be
designated
as
security
jobs.
now,
the
legislature
was
also
very
careful
with
the
term
“subversive
organization”
and
they
defined
it.
they
defined
it
as
any
group
which
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
they
also
empowered
the
state
civil
service
commission
to
make
listings
of
such
organizations.
and
they
required,
however,
that
the
state
civil
service
commission
would
be
responsible
for
having
a
hearing
and
which
the
organization
to
be
listed
could
have
an
opportunity
to
present
its
side
of
the
case.
in
addition
it
provided
that
they
could
avail
themselves
of
existing
list
of
such
organizations,
if
the
list
were
made
by
the
federal
government
or
by
the
state
board
of
regents,
provided
however,
such
listing
was
made
after
due
hearing.
now,
the
state
civil
service
commission
did
avail
itself
of
such
a
listing
of
the
communist
party
which
was
made
by
the
state
board
of
regents
in
1953,
after
extensive
hearings
as
to
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
party.
and
it
was
concluded
and
it
was
adjudicated
that
the
communist
party
did
have
as
one
of
its
policies
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
now,
i
think
the
procedure
followed
in
the
security
risk
law,
can
best
be
illustrated
by
what
happened
to
mr.
lerner
himself.
the
state
civil
service
commission
listed
the
transit
authority
as
a
security
risk
agency.
and
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
york
desiring
to
have
this
security
risk
program
carried
out
with
a
certain
degree
of
expertness,
decided
that
as
to
all
city
security
risk
agencies,
the
commissioner
of
investigation
would
conduct
the
inquiries
as
to
whether
an
employee
was
a
security
risk
or
not.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i'll
be
very
happy
to,
your
honor.
the
transit
authority
is
the
successor
to
the
old
new
york
city
board
of
transportation.
it
is
a
creature
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
reason
it
was
created
was
that
there
was
a
large
operating
deficit
in
the
operation
of
the
transit
facilities
and
the
city
was
not
raising
the
fare
to
meet
that
deficit.
so,
the
legislature
came
along
and
said,
“we'll
create
a
separate
body
and
that
body
will
be
compelled
by
law
to
charge
a
fare
which
will
produce
operating
revenue
equal
to
operating
expenses.”
but
they
transferred
all
of
the
employees
to
the
new
york
city
transit
authority
and
they
provided
by
law
that
any
of
the
facilities
formerly
used
by
the
old
board
of
transportation,
namely,
of
other
city
agencies
could
continue
to
be
used
by
the
transit
authority.
now,
when
mr.
lerner
was
called
as
part
of
this
security
risk
investigation
by
the
commissioner
of
investigation,
he
was
directed
to
go
there
by
his
employer,
the
new
york
city
transit
authority.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
the
highest
new
york
state
court,
found
that
the
commissioner
of
investigation
was
acting
not
only
for
the
city
of
new
york,
but
also
for
the
employer,
the
new
york
city
transit
authority
when
he
examined
mr.
lerner.
now,
mr.
lerner
appeared
before
the
commission
of
investigation
and
he
was
asked
a
number
of
preliminary
questions
and
then
they
came
to
the
question,
“are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
mr.
lerner
declined
to
answer
on
the
grounds
that
it
may
tend
to
incriminate
him.
the
examiner
said,
“i
think
this
is
something
you
should
give
some
consideration
to.
why
don't
you
go
home
and
think
it
over
and
come
back
in
a
week?”
mr.
lerner
came
back
in
a
week
on
september
21st,
1954,
i
believe
it
is
or
1953
and
he
--
no,
it's
--
it's
1954.
he
came
back
and
he
said,
“i
would
like
to
get
an
attorney
before
i
--
before
i
resume
the
examination
because
i
want
to
be
sure
of
what
my
rights
are
on
this
situation.”
he
came
back
with
an
attorney
sometime
around
september
30th.
the
attorney
said,
“i
would
like
time
to
prepare,”
which
time
was
given.
he
returned
again
on
october
8th
with
the
attorney
and
he
took
the
same
position
that
he
would
not
answer
questions
as
to
present
communist
party
membership
because
to
answer
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
and
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
the
transit
authority
was,
of
course,
notified
of
this
and
they
gave
the
matter
consideration
and
then
sent
a
notice
to
mr.
lerner
informing
him
that
they
concluded
that
he
was
a
security
risk.
and
in
mr.
boudin,
reading
from
the
record
or
referring
to
the
record,
he
said
that
they
told
him
because
he
had
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
he
was
found
to
be
a
security
risk.
that
tells
only
half
the
story.
the
exact
language
was
that
upon
--
pardon
me
just
a
second.
this
action
has
been
taken
because
on
september
14th
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
--
on
--
thank
you,
your
honor.
it's
page
10
of
the
record.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
and
it's
the
second
paragraph
on
that
page.
this
action
has
been
taken
because
on
september
14,
1954,
while
testifying
under
oath
at
the
office
of
the
commission
of
investigation
of
the
city
of
new
york,
he
refused
to
answer
questions
as
to
whether
he
was
then
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
same
notice
was
sent
to
him
when
he
was
notified
at
his
dismissal.
now,
there
are
--
the
information
contained
in
the
notice,
contained
in
a
narrative
form
and
informed
him
that
because
he
had
refused
to
give
the
information
he
was
asked
and
relied
on
the
invocation
of
the
privilege,
he
was
considered
as
a
security
risk.
i
think
it
is
unfair
to
say
that
the
reason
he
was
dismissed
was
because
he
had
invoked
privilege.
now,
in
any
event,
at
that
point
that
the
authority
notified
him
that
he
had
30
days
within
which
to
produce
affidavits
or
statements
as
to
why
he
should
not
be
considered
as
security
risk.
during
the
30-day
interval,
the
authority
heard
nothing
from
mr.
lerner
or
anyone
representing
him
and
they,
then,
thereupon
notify
him
of
his
dismissal.
now
under
the
security
risk
law
mr.
lerner,
could
have
gone
to
the
state
civil
service
commission
and
appealed
his
dismissal
or
his
holding
that
he
was
a
security
risk.
and
before
the
state
civil
service
commission,
he
could
have
done
a
number
of
things.
he
could
have
challenged
the
designation
of
the
communist
party
as
a
subversive
organization.
he
could
have
challenged
the
designation
of
the
transit
authority
as
security
agency.
he
could
have
challenged
the
conclusion
that
his
position
was
a
security
position.
he
could
have
challenged
the
conclusion
of
the
transit
authority
that
he
was
a
security
risk.
but
instead,
he
went
directly
to
court
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
security
risk
law
and
at
special
term,
it's
true.
the
transit
authority
did
argue
that
he
had
not
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies.
and
the
judge
at
special
term
said,
“since
there
are
no
decisions
on
the
constitutionality
of
security
risk
law,
i
will
undertake
to
pass
on
it,”
but
it
is
significant
that
the
judge
at
special
term
noted
that
mr.
lerner
was
complaining
about
a
lack
of
due
process.
and
then
on
page
22
of
the
record,
the
court
said,
“the
security
risk
law,”
this
is
the
first
paragraph
beginning
of
that
page
“also
provides
for
an
appeal
to
the
state
civil
service
commission
by
any
person
who
feels
himself
aggrieved
by
determination
of
transfer
or
dismissal,”
but
petitioner
did
not
avail
himself
of
this
relief.
it
is
observed
that
upon
appeal,
the
state
civil
service
commission
has
given
wide
latitude
to
require
amplification
of
the
reasons
given
for
the
action
appealed
from,
to
hold
or
conduct
public
hearings
or
private
hearings
and
to
subpoena
and
compel
the
attendance
of
witnesses
and
the
production
of
books,
papers,
records
and
documents.
upon
such
hearing,
the
employee
is
given
the
right
by
the
statute
to
be
represented
by
counsel
and
to
present
evidence
in
his
own
behalf.
now,
the
position
of
the
transit
authority
on
this
appeal
is
that
the
petitioner
or
the
appellant
does
not
have
the
right
to
challenge
in
this
court
any
of
those
items
which
he
could
have
had
a
full
review
on
before
the
state
civil
service
commission.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
we
pray
on
our
brief,
your
honor.
that's
not
so.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
which
indicate
that
although
it
says
the
decision
shall
be
final,
the
decisions
of
the
commission
of
education
and
similar
state
bodies
with
similar
language
in
the
statute
have
been
reviewed
by
our
courts.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
your
honor,
the
reason
that
i'm
making
the
point
is
this
and
i
don't
dispute
your
analysis
of
it,
is
that
he
cannot
raise
questions
as
to
lack
of
procedure
when
he
didn't
avail
himself
of
the
procedure.
i
agree
that
there
is
presented
a
question
here
as
to
whether
or
not
the
public
employer,
when
the
public
employee
refuses
to
give
information
as
to
present
communist
party
membership
and
then
invokes
as
the
reason
for
it
that
it
may
tend
to
incriminate
him.
i
agree
that
that
question
is
here
before
this
court
as
to
whether
the
public
employer
may
then
determine
that
he
is
a
person
no
longer
worthy
of
trust.
i
think
that's
before
the
court,
but
i
think
the
lack
of
procedure
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well
--
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
did
not
raise
any
question
as
to
the
lack
of
process.
the
appellate
division
passed
on
it
and
the
appellate
division
said,
“there
was
process
and
you
could
have
gone
to
the
state
civil
service
commission.”
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
do
is
they
said
there
was
a
valid
basis
here
under
the
act
for
finding
that
this
employee
was
a
security
risk.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
i
--
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
inherent
in
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
is
an
acknowledgment
that
under
the
statute
be
aware
that
specifically
provided
under
the
statute
that
if
he
wanted
additional
opportunities
to
explain
or
to
challenge
certain
things,
they
were
there
for
him.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
it's
in
the
opinion
at
the
appellate
division
level,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
it
just
that
way.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
came
down
to
the
--
to
the
basic
proposition
in
which
it
held
that
it's
the
refusal
to
answer.
that
is
the
thing
that
breaches
the
bond
of
confidence
between
the
employer
and
an
employee.
mr.
daniel
t.
scannell
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
think
this
is
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
garner,
except
that
in
reality,
it's
a
stronger
situation
than
garner.
in
garner,
as
i
read
the
case,
you
had
a
general
enactment
in
1941
which
said
employees
may
not
belong
to
organizations
which
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
then,
you
had
it
implemented
in
1948
by
an
enactment
of
the
municipality
of
los
angeles
which
required
that
the
employees
supplied
by
affidavit
information
as
to
communist
party
membership
present
and
past
as
well
as
the
communist
political
association.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
case
to
indicate
that
the
local
legislative
body
in
making
that
directive
had
reached
any
conclusions
after
hearing
as
to
the
nature
and
character
of
the
communist
party.
now,
in
the
instant
case,
you
have
a
full
scale
hearing
at
which
the
aims
and
purposes
of
the
party
had
developed.
and
then,
the
question
is
put
to
the
employee
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
a
member.
now,
i
think
the
situation
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
slochower
in
that
you
don't
have
any
of
the
automatic
forfeiture
features
on
the
posing
of
the
question
as
such.
it's
true
by
refusing
to
answer
the
question
he
was
deemed
to
be
a
security
risk.
but
it
is
not
the
situation
you
had
in
also
wieman
against
updegraff
where
the
employee
had
to
take
the
oath
at
his
peril
and
there
wasn't
a
provision
for
scienter
or
knowing
membership.
now,
of
course,
if
the
decision
is
reached
that
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
so
broad
that
it
released
the
employee
of
all
obligations
to
answer
his
employer,
i
would
suggest
that
you're
really
going
to
have
a
new
era
of
employer-employee
relationships
and
the
employer
will
be
compelled
in
almost
all
instances
to
start
to
seek
information
and
evidence
from
sources
other
than
the
employee.
the
traditional
thing,
as
i
understand
it,
both
in
public
and
private
employment
is
if
there's
a
question
involving
the
employee
to
go
directly
to
the
employee
and
ask
him
and
the
employee
is
under
a
corresponding
obligation
to
answer.
and
i
think
that
the
contention
that
it's
only
when
a
state
legislature
or
a
local
legislative
body
frames
the
particular
question
and
frames
the
obligation
to
answer
that
it's
only
under
those
circumstances,
is
really
to
ignore
the
fundamental
philosophy
present
in
garner
which
is
that
there
are
certain,
pertinent
information,
questions
which
the
employer
may
put
and
which
the
employee
is
under
an
obligation
to
answer.
now,
the
attorney
for
the
appellant
has
made
references
to
our
brief
of
that
special
term
and
i
think
if
the
court
reads
the
brief
in
each
case,
it
will
find
that
it
was
in
a
sense
of
reciting
what
the
appellant
has
done.
it
says
that
he
refused
to
answer

gave
it
as
his
reason
for
answering

refusing
to
answer,
the
invocation
of
the
fifth

all
through
the
case,
is
the
clear
indication
that
it
was
his
refusal
to
answer,
rather
than
the
means
used
that
caused
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
bad
risk.
i've
agreed
to
share
my
time
with
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
