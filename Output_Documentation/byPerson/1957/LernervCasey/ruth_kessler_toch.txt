ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
is
in
this
case,
not
only
in
support
of
his
--
of
his
statutory
duty
to
appear
in
support
of
constitutionality
of
state
statute,
but
in
essence
representing
the
civil
service
commission
of
the
state
which
supervises
the
civil
service
system
in
new
york
state
and
has
the
overall
responsibility
of
administering
this
particular
law.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
would
think
not.
it
would
depend
upon
what
ground.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
certainly
think
not.
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
under
the
principle
that
the
court
does
not
reach
constitutional
questions
unless
they
are
presented
and
there
is
one
question
presented
in
this
case.
we,
here,
urge
that
under
the
striking
of
a
balance
between
the
public
interest,
the
government's
interest
in
the
protection
of
the
freedom
of
all
the
people
and
the
total
freedom
of
the
individual
this
application
of
the
statute
in
this
case
has
been
entirely
constitutional
and
i
say
this
after
so
searching
as
a
public
employee
to
whom
that
the
statute
might
well
be
applied.
now,
they
--
i
think
we
ought
to
have
in
mind
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
several
questions
which
i
believe
take
them
out
over
the
case.
in
the
first
place,
it
has
construed
the
statute
as
implicitly
permitting
the
asking
of
this
question.
it
has
also,
of
course,
construed
the
status
of
the
transit
authority
and
the
commissioner
of
investigation
and
that
is
a
construction
of
state
statutes.
it
has
also
said,
“why
this
petitioner
was
dismissed
and
--
and
the
grounds
upon
which
he
was
not
dismissed.”
at
page
63
of
the
record,
chief
justice
conway
says
that
no
inference
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
must
draw
from
the
refusal
to
answer.
he
also
says
that
the
petitioner
was
not
discharged
for
invoking
the
fifth
amendment,
that
he
was
discharged
for
creating
a
doubt
as
to
his
trustworthiness
and
reliability
by
refusing
to
answer
the
question
as
to
communist
party
membership.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
that
it
is
very
clear
and
i
think
that
judge
conway
used
an
illustration
in
his
--
in
his
opinion
that
makes
it
clear.
i
think
we
stand
with
the
premise
that
under
the
principles
which
this
court
has
laid
down,
the
government
has
the
right
to
ask
the
employee
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
is
required
to
answer.
now,
if
he
adds
to
it,
as
judge
conway
says
he
says,
“i
won't
answer.”
he
turns
around
and
walks
out
of
the
room,
he
comes
back
five
minutes
later
and
he
said,
“you
know
why
i
don't
want
to
--
i
won't
answer
it,
because
i
think
it
will
incriminate
me.”
now,
i
don't
think
that
--
and,
of
course,
needn't
think
that
that
takes
away
from
--
relieves
him
of
the
obligation
to
answer
or
takes
away
from
government
the
right
to
have
the
answer
from
him.
because
if
that
were
so,
we
might
as
well
forget
about
this
obligation
to
answer
because
practically
any
employee
will
be
out
his
mind
if
he
didn't
have
that
reason.
and
moreover,
i
think
that
that
is
--
let's
--
let's
assume
for
the
purpose
of
argument
ant
i
stress
very
strongly,
that
i'm
assuming
it
for
the
purpose
of
argument
and
i
stress
very
solemnly
that
i'm
assuming
it
for
the
purpose
of
arguing
only.
let's
assume
that
he's
adding
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
reason,
did
add
to
the
doubt
in
the
mind
--
that
he
created
in
the
mind
of
his
employer
as
to
its
trustworthiness
because
he
refused
to
answer
the
question.
i
don't
think
that
we
are
diminishing
the
value
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
disturbing
the
principle
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
reference
to
it.
if
we
say
that
yes,
it
did
add
the
doubt
and
that
was
the
reason
for
it
because
he
is
not
being
forced
to
answer
the
question.
he
is
not
being
prosecuted
for
contempt
for
refusal
to
answer
the
question.
and
incidentally,
i
should
say
that
there's
a
case
pending
in
the
courts
in
new
york.
i
don't
think
it's
unethical
to
say
that
mr.
boudin
is
counsel
for
the
petitioner
there.
we've
argued
in
special
terms
several
years
ago.
it
is
pending
and
because
mr.
boudin
has
asked
the
court
to
withhold
decision
until
this
case
is
decided.
there,
the
employee
also
an
operating
employee
of
the
transit
is
--
of
the
new
york
city
subway
system,
refused
to
answer
the
question
and
did
not
plea
the
fifth
amendment,
he
was
dismissed
too.
in
other
words,
the
transit
authority
would
dismiss
an
operating
employee
for
refusal
to
answer
the
question
whether
he
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
or
he
didn't,
but
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
protect
and
i
think
this
court
had
said
so
in
a
--
in
a
series
of
decisions
on
the
fifth
amendment
two
years
ago.
it
does
not
protect.
it
protects
rather
against
being
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
oneself
so
that
the
testimony
will
be
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
that
is
its
ineffable
value.
but
if
in
pleading
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
court
has
said
so
and
several
of
the
justices
have
said
so
individually,
if
he
suggests
doubt
about
himself
or
bring
some
other
disadvantage
to
himself,
that
is
something
which
he
can't,
broadly
speaking,
avoid.
and
if
there
are
further
results,
he
has
no
complaint
under
the
constitution.
he
has
had
and
he
has
and
continues
his
--
to
have
his
constitutional
right
to
silence
and
that
is
what
the
fifth
amendment
protects
and
he
has
it
here.
now,
in
returning
to
--
and
i
--
in
doing
this
in
somewhat
broad
strokes,
leaving
some
of
the
particular
question
of
this
procedure
here
and
so
on
to
mr.
scannell,
one
challenge
that
they
--
mr.
boudin
makes
is
to
the
propriety
of
enacting
or
continuing
to
enact
the
security
risk
law
--
a
security
risk
law
at
this
time.
now,
apart
from
the
question
that,
unless
the
law
was
surely
unreasonable,
this
court
and
no
court
will
go
behind
the
legislature's
judgment
that
the
statute
is
necessary.
and
also,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
the
east
new
york
case,
one
emergency
may
bring
us
back
to
the
bar.
other
--
where
emergency
may
cause
its
continuance.
i
think
that
the
cole
case
was
decided
on
the
premise
that
without
even
a
discussion
of
it
that
there
is
certainly
a
reasonable
need
for
a
security
risk
law
at
this
time.
and
that
was
in
1956
and
i
doubt
that
there
is
less
reason
today.
now,
i
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
that
this
--
the
right
to
ask
this
question
is
implicit
in
this
statute.
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
to
provide
by
statute
for
the
right
of
an
employer
to
ask
a
particular
question.
i
think
if
the
question
is
upon
the
subject
which
is
barred
for
some
constitutional
reason,
then
that
may
be
raised
as
a
--
as
it
was
raised
in
garner,
such
as
being
raised
here.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
needs
to
provide
that
the
particular
question
may
be
asked.
now,
we
have,
this
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
ask
an
employee
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
exists.
now,
i
think
if
we
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
underlying
reason
why
the
court
has
so
held,
we
find
that
the
refusal
to
answer
the
question
in
this
case
meets
the
ground
for
discharge
under
the
statute.
isn't
that
actually
on
the
theory,
if
you
will,
that
it
fell
down
to
this
case
but
on
a
theory
that
government
is
not
required
to
employ
persons
of
doubtful
trust
and
reliability.
now,
that
has
been
applied
to
various
decisions
to
employees
generally
in
the
garner
case,
to
school
teachers
in
the
adler
case
and
so
on.
and
here,
we
have
a
security
risk
law.
so,
what
appears
to
be
a
fortiori.
now,
why
the
court
has
held
that
the
question
as
to
party
membership
is
permissible,
i
think
it's
very
plain
in
the
context
of
our
times.
the
communist
party
is
not
a
conventional
political
party
and
this
court
has
said
so
over
and
over
again.
unfortunately,
and
for
that
reason
the
--
that
question
is
permissible.
it
is
relevant
to
public
employment
and
it
is
certainly
relevant
to
employment
in
security
positions
and
i
should
add
that
the
state
civil
service
commission
has
specifically
construed
the
statute
as
applicable
only
to
persons
in
security
positions
and
within,
in
january,
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
state
has
upheld
that
construction
and
thus
far,
no
appeal
has
been
taken
at
the
same
time
to
appeal
has
expired.
now,
as
to
drawing
doubt
from
the
refusal
to
answer
the
question,
that
is
quite
a
normal
reaction
to
anyone's
refusal
to
answer
the
question
--
a
question.
if
mr.
boudin
were
to
ask
me,
“did
you
stop
in
the
clerk's
office
on
the
way
to
the
court
room?”
and
i
were
to
say,
“i
won't
tell
you.”
he,
of
course,
i'm
suggesting
a
doubt
is
to
whether
i
did
or
whether
i
didn't.
now,
and
--
and
also
as
to,
“why
on
earth
won't
she
tell
me?”
of
course,
normally,
it
is
--
one
doesn't
and
may
not
answer
a
question
because
when
it
concludes
that
it
is
no
affair
of
the
questioner.
but
in
this
case,
that
it
is
an
affair
of
the
government
whether
he
is
or
is
not
a
member
the
communist
party.
and
we
can
cite
that
in
this
particular
case
the
normal
reaction
is
not
an
understandable
one
and
a
proper
one.
now,
as
to
--
as
i've
said,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
petitioner
here
was
not
discharged
for
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
so
it's
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
the
question
of
whether
one
maybe
discharged
for
membership
in
the
party
under
this
bar
or
the
question
of
knowledge
and
so
on
is
not
to
be
decided
in
this
case
because
for
one
thing,
it
is
not
in
the
case
and,
or
in
addition
and
for
that
very
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
it
and
this
court
has
held
that
it
will
not
--
it
will
not
construe
statutory
provisions
before
the
highest
state
court
has
construed
them.
i
think
that
--
that,
that
about
covers
the
three
broad
issues
in
--
in
the
case
which
i
have
felt
the
state
civil
service
commission
should
bring
before
the
court.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
(inaudible)
whittaker.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
oh,
indeed
not.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
i
do
not,
judge
whittaker.
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
agree
with
mr.
scannell
that
it
was
--
it
created
doubt
of
trust
and
reliability
under
this
and
the
basis
of
discharge
under
the
statute
is
a
reasonable
finding
of
doubtful
trust
and
reliability.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
see
a
doubt
in
his
mind
about
myself.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
oh,
no,
no.
in
fact,
our
position
is
that
he
was
discharged
and
properly
so,
for
refusal
to
answer
the
question
and
the
fact
that
he's
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
had
no
bearing.
and
we're
saying
that
there
is
a
misstatement
of
the
issue
when
mr.
boudin
argues
that
he
was
dismissed
for
pleading
the
fifth
amendment.
he
was
not
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
in
the
passage
that
i
read.
he
was
dismissed
only
for
refusal
to
answer
for
creating
doubt
as
to
his
trustworthiness
and
reliability
by
refusing
to
answer.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
because
he
had
the
obligation
to
answer.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
because
he
--
he
was
refusing
to
answer
a
question
that
government
has
the
right
to
have
from
him.
and
so,
he
was
not
establishing
that
report
with
his
employer
on
a
subject
as
to
which
the
employer
had
the
right
to
have
the
truth
from
him,
the
assurance
from
him.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
what
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
he
--
he
had
to
as
you
say,
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter
make
this
choice
and
he
made
the
choice
and
if
there
were
some
i
mean
if
--
if
at
least
the
employer
was
therefore
so
troubled
about
him,
that
he
felt
that
he
could
not
keep
him
on
in
a
security
position,
that
was
the
choice
that
he
selected.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
yes
if
we
want
to
go
to
that
far
i
think
perhaps
if
it
was
a
reasonable
inference.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
they
didn't
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
mr.
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
perhaps
we
have
three
possibilities
there.
an
inference
of
reliability,
an
inference
of
unreliability
and
in
between
the
inference
which
was
the
basis
of
discharge,
which
is
the
basis
of
discharge
under
the
statute,
just
doubt.
he
didn't
answer.
they
didn't
know.
therefore,
they
did
not
have
the
assurance
that
he
was
trustworthy
and
reliable.
and
therefore,
under
the
statute,
they
had
a
right
to
discharge
him.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
right.
[laughs]
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
that's
the
suspension
notice
(inaudible).
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
justice
black.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
think
that
we
have
to
read
it.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
the
word
“and
“before
“and
invokes
the
fifth
amendment.”
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
i
think
tremendously
important.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
mr.
justice
black,
the
transit
authority,
its
secretary,
so
to
speak.
the
executive
director
and
general
manager
sent
the
notice
to
mr.
lerner
and
included
the
resolution
of
the
transit
authority
which
he
was
simply
reporting
in
the
letter.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
and
the
resolution
says,
as
the
ground
for
--
for
a
suspension.
that
you
refuse
to
answer
questions,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
invoked
the
fifth
amendment.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
it
says
that
twice.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
page?
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
now,
that's
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
that
was
mr.
justice
brennan's
statement
in
the
course
of
his
opinion.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
i
think
that
that
brief
is
mr.
scannell's
brief
which
he
can
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
now,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
what
judge
brennan
was
doing
there,
was
giving
added
reasons
to
support
his
determination.
it
was
the
--
perhaps,
the
policy
as
--
as
embodied
in
the
--
in
903.
it
is
the
policy
in
a
sense
that's
embodied
in
article
1,
section
6
of
the
--
of
our
state
constitution.
but
that
does
not
say
that
was
the
ground
for
the
--
for
dismissal.
now,
mr.
scanell
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i'm
reading
it
over.
assuming
that
the
answer
to
(2),
that
is
whether
the
transit
authority
was
probably
designated
security
agent
say,
“whether,
the
security
risk
law
authorizes
the
transit
authority
to
suspend
and
discharge
when
occupying
the
position,
subway
conductor
and
such
security
agency
merely
a
--
upon
his
showing
them
or
not
that
he
was
then
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
refused
to
answer
and
then
gave
us
a
reason
for
so
refusing
that
to
answer
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
yes,
precisely,
mr.
justice
black.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
he
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
was
recited
and
the
court,
judge
conway
--
chief
judge
conway
is
here
reciting
the
issue
that
has
been
presented
by
the
facts
and
by
the
appellant.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
the
--
this
court
handed
down
the
slochower
opinion
between
the
time
that
the
--
the
--
our
main
briefs
were
filed
in
the
appellate
division
and
the
time
that
the
appellate
division
rendered
its
decision.
and
if
look,
mr.
justice
black,
at
the
judge,
you
get
his
opinion
in
the
appellate
division,
he
did
consider
it.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
am
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
will
go
back
and
look
at
my
brief
in
special
term
and
see
exactly
what
i
did
say.
now,
mr.
scannell
asked
me
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
another
portion
of
judge
brenner's
opinion,
page
25
of
the
record.
he
says,
“if
he
makes
the
disclosure
of
non-affiliation,
he
loses
nothing
and
regain
the
confidence
which
was
formally
beset
by
suspicion,
thus
guilty
or
not,
no
man
in
public
service
is
entitled
to
withhold
information
as
to
this
communist
association
and
at
the
same
time
serve
the
people.”
now,
in
other
words,
it
appears
to
me
mr.
justice
black
that
all
the
way
through
the
court's
opinions,
we're
reciting
the
fact
and
they
were.
they
were
telling
the
whole
story,
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
took
cognizance
of
what
was
part
of
the
fact.
i
--
enter
--
i
mean
what
had
happened
does
not
mean
that
that
was
the
basis
for
his
dismissal.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
it
didn't
because
--
mr.
justice
black,
because
the
court
of
appeals
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
don't
think
it
did.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
that
the
--
a
court
has
the
right
and
this
court
does
such
all
the
time,
decides
a
--
cases
on
what
it
regards
as
the
proper
basis
of
decision
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
whether
that
is
something
that's
raised
or
not.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
oh,
i
should
say,
sir.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
indeed.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
quite
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no
question
about
it.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
wouldn't
have
any
such
case
in
mind,
of
that
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
in
the
first
place
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
this
was
not
a
conviction.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
don't
think
it
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
is,
but
it
was
i
--
i
say
again
that
these
were
things
that
were
raised.
i
mean,
they
were
in
the
case.
i
think
the
court
did
not
ignore
them.
i
--
i
think,
the
court
decided
the
case
exactly
on
the
basis
on
which
the
transit
authority
had
dismissed
the
man.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
and
--
and
i
--
and
the
court
simply
took
cognizance.
i
think,
all
the
opinions
in
this
case
were
very
thoughtfully
read,
that
every
aspect
was
very
carefully
considered.
and
so,
they
--
they
explored
everything.
judge
brenner
did,
judge
(inaudible),
chief
judge
conway
did,
but
they
then
decided
the
case
upon
the
facts
as
they
actually
occurred
and
rejected
the
interpretation,
if
you
will
that
mr.
--
that
the
appellant
has
been
making
here
and
that
he
made
below.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
sure.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no
--
no.
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
indeed
do
not
and
i
--
i
try
to
say
that
very
near
the
outset
of
the
argument.
i
think,
under
ullman,
definitely
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
we're
not
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
well,
i
think
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
factually,
mr.
justice
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
--
harlan
it
was
and
that
is
why
i
have
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
factually,
it
was
the
plea
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
the
basis
of
this
charge
and
that
is
why
i
discussed
the
cases
though
it
hadn't
been
pleaded.
and
then
also,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
had
been
and
i
think
that
under
ullman,
they
--
and
slochower,
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
discharge
him
for
creating
a
doubt.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
except
that
there
are
all
the
--
the
factors
that
would
be
distinguishing
because
here,
there
would
be
a
question
of
the
substance
of
the
question
and
also
the
fact
that
it
was
the
employer
who
was
doing
the
questioning.
and
i
have
tried
to
itemize,
so
to
speak,
the
--
the
distinguishing
factors.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
justice
brennan.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
so.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
--
i
--
yes.
i
make
no
distinction
and
then
i
--
it
--
but.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
and
the
“but”
is
that
even
though
he
--
yes
--
no,
i'll
come
back
to
it.
i
make
no
distinction.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
say
they
have
--
they
have
the
right
to
dismiss
for
refusing
to
answer
the
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
no,
i
don't.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes,
i
think
--
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
i
think
we
have
to.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
that's
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
yes.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
exactly,
right.
ms.
ruth
kessler
toch
exactly
right.
