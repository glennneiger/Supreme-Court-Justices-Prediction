justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
ms.
toch,
is
it
your
view
that
this
case
was
decided
upon
the
finding
by
the
court
that
the
refusal
to
answer
was
evidence
of
past
communist
affiliation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
why
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
argue
that
matter
here?
i
understood
that
it
was
mr.
scannell's
argument
that
the
court
sustained
the
discharge
upon
the
ground,
that
the
refusal
to
answer
was
such
insubordination
and
the
like
has
justified
the
--
the
discharge.
now,
do
you
take
a
contrary
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
stated
in
your
example
that
if
you
had
told
mr.
boudin
and
in
answer
to
his
questions
to
whether
you'd
stopped
at
the
clerk
--
clerk's
office
that
you
refused
to
answer.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
might
legitimately
refer
--
infer
some
--
that
--
that
you
have
for
example.
now,
what
relevance
has
that
to
--
to
this
case
(voice
overlap)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
to
say
that
the
failure
to
--
that
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
privilege
is
some
evidence
that
the
answer
if
given
would
have
been
affirmative?

charles
