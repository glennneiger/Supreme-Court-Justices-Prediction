justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe
this
is
the
same
question
that
the
cost
of
lot
sold
is
of
course
not
a
deduction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
by
reason
of
the
definition
of
gross
income?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
gross
income.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
in
fact
the
statute
had
made
cost
of
lot
sold
a
deduction.
the
argument
you're
making
here
is
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
not
remain
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
--
why
is
the
--
why
is
the
schedule
prepared
the
way
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
your
schedule
prepared
as
it
is?
you
have
made
--
according
to
this,
you
have
a
schedule
of
income.
you
have
subheading
revenue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gross
--
gross
receipts
of
sale.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
take
off
the
cost
of
lot
sold.
now,
down
below
that,
you
have
a
brand
new
category
called
“deduction.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
don't
they
enter
into
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
why
don't
go
to
deduction
equally
under
any
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
government
conceded.
