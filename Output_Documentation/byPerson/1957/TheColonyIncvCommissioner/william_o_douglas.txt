well,
how
far
does
that
take
--
take
us
suppose
that
i
properly
report
my
--
my
salary?
but
i
improperly
claim
exemptions
and
deductions
so
that
the
--
that
the
taxable
income
is
reported
inaccurately
by
more
than
25%.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
not.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
how
do
you
distinguish
that
through
this
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
would
be
--
your
rule
would
be
applicable
to
excess
the
claims
for
depreciation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
do
you
--
why
do
you
draw
that
distinction
in
this
case
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
between
depreciation
case
and
your
--
this
instant
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
definition
of
gross
income
includes
gains
and
profits
derived
from
any
sort,
and
that
requires
a
competition
that
--
at
a
retail
store.
it
has
gross
--
gross
receipts
and
he
has
expenses.
you
have
to
figure
your
deductions
for
this
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
--
that's
--
that's
what
i
thought
hastie
was
worrying
about
in
the
third
circuit.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
told
me
that
the
problem
of
deduction
isn't
here,
but
i
would
think
that
--
that
you
get
to
the
profits
or
the
gains
or
profits
of
a
retail
store
and
that
you
get
into
deduction
necessarily.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
from
any
source,
what
--
whatever
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
was
just
trying
to
see
how
far
your
theory
would
be
applied.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
hastie
was
not
exaggerating,
that
he
has
--
i
mean
i
--
i
don't
understand.
