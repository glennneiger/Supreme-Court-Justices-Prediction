mr.
a.
robert
doll
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case
rising
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
specifically,
the
question
in
this
case
involves
the
statutory
construction
of
section
275
(c)
of
the
1939
code.
generally
speaking,
the
internal
revenue
service
must
assess
tax
deficiencies
or
taxes
within
three
years
after
a
tax
return
is
filed.
there
are
certain
exceptions
including
fraudulent
returns
and
where
no
return
is
filed,
where
there's
no
statute.
there's
the
so-called
five-year
statute
which
is
the
one
we're
dealing
with.
that
section
provides
that
if
a
taxpayer
omits
from
gross
income,
amounts
properly
includable
therein
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
gross
income
stated
in
the
return
then
the
commissioner
has
five
years
instead
of
three
to
make
the
assessment.
the
taxpayer's
construction
of
that
statute
is
that
omits
from
gross
income
means
leaving
out
items
of
receipt.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
contends
that
where
--
wherever
a
taxpayer's
gross
income
is
understated
in
a
statutory
amount
regardless
of
the
cause
of
the
understatement,
the
five-year
statute
applies.
in
terms
of
volume,
i
think
perhaps
the
petitioner
has
a
better
side
of
the
case.
this
issue
of
course
has
been
up
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeal
for
the
third,
fifth,
ninth
and
eighth
circuits
have
construed
the
statute
the
way
that
the
taxpayer
here
is
contending.
on
the
other
hand,
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
are
construed
as
the
respondent
without
having
construed.
i
think
that
the
facts
in
this
case
point
up
the
issue,
the
material
facts
and
they
are
the
--
this
taxpayer
was
in
the
subdivision
business
subdividing
the
land.
he
did
not
build
but
he
subdivide
it.
during
the
years
in
question,
he
reported
all
of
his
gross
receipts
from
a
sale
of
his
lots
but
he
over
reported
the
cost
of
his
lot
sold.
he
overstated
them.
the
principal
item
of
overstatement
was
the
cost
of
a
water
supply
system
which
he
had
allocated
certain
amounts
to
that
cost
to
each
lot
that
was
sold.
the
tax
court
held
on
the
merits
that
he'd
overstated
the
cost
and
i
might
point
out
that
they
went
at
some
length,
i
think,
they
had
to
distinguish
a
earlier
decision
of
theirs
to
decide
against
the
taxpayer
on
the
merits.
as
you
can
see
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
no,
sir.
it
was
not.
it
was
--
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
and
the
government
made
reference
to
it,
this
was
an
innocent
overstatement
that
had
a
reasonable
basis.
now,
the
tax
court
held
as
a
--
has
held
in
the
past
that
in
this
case
where
the
overstatement
of
the
cost
to
good
sold
resulted
in
an
understated
gross
income
and
--
that
overstated
offset
item
resulting
in
an
understated
gross
income
that
there
was
no
omission.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirm
citing
an
earlier
decision
of
this
it
--
of
its
own.
i
think,
however,
at
least
we
feel
that
in
its
opinion,
which
is
very
short,
the
sixth
circuit
perhaps
indicated
that
it
had
misgivings
because
it
eluded
favorably,
we
think,
to
the
contrary
decisions
in
the
courts
of
appeal
for
the
third,
fifth,
ninth
and
eighth
circuits.
the
reasons
why
the
petitioner
thinks
that
it
is
right
are
as
follows.
as
i've
said,
our
position
is
that
omits
from
gross
income
means
leaves
out
items
of
receipt.
first
of
all,
the
statutory
language
itself,
the
verb
in
the
statute
is
the
word
“omits.”
the
ordinary
and
normal
meaning
of
that
verb
according
to
the
dictionary
is
to
leave
out
to
--
not
to
mention
the
fail
to
include
or
insert.
secondly,
going
to
the
legislative
history,
we
feel
that
that
--
that
that
also
supports
this.
i
might,
if
i
may,
take
you
back
to
when
this
was
put
in
to
the
--
the
code.
it
was
in
the
revenue
act
of
1934.
in
the
revenue
act
of
1932,
the
--
the
statute
of
limitations,
they're
set
out
with
a
normal
three-year
statute
and
then
they
switched
over
to
no
statutes
of
--
no
statute
of
limitations
in
the
case
of
fraudulent
returns
and
no
returns.
in
the
revenue
act
of
1934,
when
this
section
275
(c)
was
first
proposed,
there
was
an
unlimited
statute
of
limitations.
we
feel
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
to
catch
situations
that
were,
to
certain
extent,
similar
to
a
fraudulent
return
or
filing
no
return
at
all.
they
--
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations.
but
going
to
the
committee
reports
themselves,
if
i
may
just
briefly
and
i'm
looking
at
page
14
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
in
the
--
the
first
pertinent
bit
of
legislative
history
was
a
house
subcommittee
report
starting
in
the
--
at
the
second
paragraph.
"your
subcommittee
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
limitation
period
on
assessment
should
also
not
apply
to
certain
cases
where
the
taxpayer
has
understated
his
gross
income
on
his
return
by
a
large
amount,
even
though
fraud
with
intent
to
evade
tax
cannot
be
established.
it
is,
therefore,
recommended
that
the
statute
of
limitations
shall
not
apply
where
the
taxpayer
has
failed
to
disclose
in
his
return
an
amount
of
gross
income
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
amount
of
gross
income
stated
in
the
return.
the
government
should
not
be
penalized
where
a
taxpayer
is
so
negligent
as
to
leave
out
items
of
such
magnitude
from
his
return."
following
this
subcommittee
report,
there
was
a
hearing
that
was
held
before
the
full
house
committee
and
at
that
time,
mr.
roswell
magill
was
with
the
treasury
department
and
he
had
a
--
a
discussion
which
is
set
out
on
page
15
of
the
petitioner's
brief
with
--
with
congressman
jerry
cooper
of
tennessee.
now
if
i
may
just
prefer
to
the
first
question
and
answer,
"mr.
cooper,
what
we
really
had
in
mind
was
just
this
kind
of
a
situation.
assume
that
a
taxpayer
left
out,
say,
a
million
dollars,
he
just
forgot
it.
we
felt
that
whenever
we
found
that
he
did
that
we
ought
to
get
the
money
on
it,
the
tax
on
it.”
following
the
--
this
hearing,
the
house
committee
adopted
a
report
also
providing
for
an
unlimited
period
for
assessment
and
their
report
which
is
similar
to
the
one
i
read,
the
--
the
subcommittee
report
is
on
page
--
well,
16
and
also
the
senate
finance
committee
report.
now,
we
feel
that
when
you
take
the
--
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
statute
and
when
you
go
to
the
legislative
history
that
is
clear
that
--
that
what
congress
was
really
concerned
with
was
leaving
out
items
of
receipt.
after
all
that
--
that
is
what
you
put
in
the
tax
return.
now,
in
this
case
where
we
have
an
understatement
of
gross
income
that
results
from
--
from
an
inflated
item,
there's
nothing
left
out
of
this
return,
there's
too
much
put
in.
and
from
a
logical
standpoint,
i
don't
think
congress
was
--
was
aiming
at
that.
for
example,
when
you
take
your
gross
income,
there
is
--
there
are
deductions
from
gross
income.
in
other
words,
section
23
of
the
1939
code
permits
rent
and
so
forth
to
be
deducted
from
gross
income
to
get
your
net
income.
well,
quite
obviously,
the
statute
would
not
apply
regardless
of
how
far
overstated
these
rent
items
or
salary
or
what
have
you,
these
deductible
items.
now,
we
feel
that
those
items,
those
overstated
items
where
there
are
errors
resulting
from
a
--
from
an
overstatement
below
the
gross
income
line
that
are
clearly
not
--
will
not
bring
a
statute
into
play.
the
congress
didn't
--
didn't
have
in
mind
that
an
error
above
the
gross
income
line
and
the
cost
of
good
sold
that
--
that
they
weren't
really
concerned
with
that
type
of
an
error.
they
--
they
were
concerned
with
left
out
items.
and
i
--
i
think
that
perhaps
the
reason
for
that
--
there's
a
reason
for
that.
in
the
case
of
overstated
deductions,
as
well
as
overstated
cost
of
good
sold,
that
figures
on
the
tax
return.
to
get
the
benefit
from
that
figure,
you've
got
to
claim
it
on
the
tax
return.
well,
the
revenue
agents,
they
don't
have
the
same
problems
of
trying
to
discover
where
the
error
is.
it's
on
the
return
and
they
can
just
verify
it
from
--
from
what's
already
there.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
what
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
uptegrove
case
found
that
that
was
a
mathematical
error
that
congress
was
not
concerned
with
that
type
of
an
error.
they
were
concerned
with
leaving
out.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
the
opinions
that
have
construed
the
statute
as
we're
now
urging
or
--
it's
--
the
--
there's
the
uptegrove
case
in
the
third
circuit,
which
was
the
first
case
decided
and
that
is
exactly
the
same
on
the
facts
to
this
case.
that
was
a
cost
of
good
sold
case.
the
court,
the
third
circuit
then
decided
the
deakman-wells
case
where
a
taxpayer
showed
his
gross
receipts
on
a
schedule
attached
to
his
return
but
then
subtracted
items
from
it
to
convert
itself
to
a
--
a
cash
basis.
the
--
the
next
decision
was
--
i
think
was
the
goodenow
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
slaff
versus
the
commissioner,
which
was
the
ninth
circuit
case
and
davis
v.
hightower,
a
fifth
circuit
case.
all
those
cases
adopt
this
construction.
there's
one
further
point
that
i
would
like
to
mention
--
mention
the
--
the
statutory
language,
the
legislative
history
and
what
we
think
is
the
logic
of
the
interpretation.
in
1954,
congress
enacted
section
6501
--
6501(e)
(1)
(a),
which
is
the
successor
to
section
275
(c)
of
the
1939
code.
in
--
and
i'm
looking
at
page
23
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
footnote
sets
forth
the
new
--
the
new
law.
under
a,
the
general
rule,
congress
adopted
precisely
the
same
language
that
was
contained
in
section
275
(c).
it
made
two
changes,
which
aren't
--
which
are
not
material,
but
they
adopted
substantially
the
same
language.
if
the
taxpayer
omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
properly
includible
therein,
then
for
purposes
of
this
subparagraph,
they
go
down
to
subsection
(i).
in
the
case
of
a
trade
or
business,
the
term
"gross
income"
means
the
total
of
the
amounts
received
from
sale
of
goods
or
services
prior
to
diminution
by
the
cost
of
such
sales.
in
other
words,
in
that
subsection
(i),
congress
is
essentially
adopting
the
--
the
construction
we
urge
in
this
case.
the
government
has
contended
that
congress
changed
the
law
in
1954.
we
admit
that
the
law
was
changed
to
the
extent
that
they
started
out
with
the
old
law
and
then
they
added
new
language.
the
purpose
of
that
new
language,
we
think,
was
obviously
to
approve
the
prior
construction.
they
agreed
with
it
and
we
think
it
was
to
explain
it
and
to
clarify
and
to
say
what
the
proper
construction
of
the
predecessor
section
was.
in
the
committee
reports
that
i
referred
to,
there
are
in
each
of
those
reports,
statements
of
a
general
nature
to
the
effect
and
they
start
out
the
reports
on
that
thing
and
i'm
looking
at
page
14,
the
house
subcommittee
report.
"your
subcommittee
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
limitation
period
on
assessment
should
--
should
also
not
apply
to
certain
cases
where
the
taxpayer
has
understated
his
gross
income
on
his
return."
the
respondent
attaches
great
significance
to
the
use
of
the
word
“understatement”
there.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
and
we
think
quite
correctly
that
that
was
of
a
general
introductory
nature
that
after
that
language
in
each
of
the
committee
reports,
congress
wants
a
specific
example
of
--
of
what
they
were
thinking
about.
the
next
sentence,
for
example,
“it
is,
therefore,
recommended
that
--
that
statute
of
limitations
shall
not
apply
where
the
taxpayer
has
failed
to
disclose
in
his
return
an
amount
of
gross
income
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
gross
income
stated
in
the
return.
the
government
should
not
be
penalized
where
a
taxpayer
is
so
negligent
as
to
leave
out
items."
in
conclusion,
we
think
that
the
common
sense
reading
the
statute
is
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
and
the
logical
approach
is
to
show
that
that
--
that
the
only
way
--
what
congress
really
intended
was
to
give
the
taxpayer
two
extra
years.
he's
already
--
the
--
the
commissioner
already
has
three
years,
that
he
was
to
have
two
more
years
where
a
--
items
of
receipt
were
left
out
of
the
return,
the
computation
of
gross
income.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
may
it
please
the
court.
i
submit
that
the
respondent's
argument
is
based
on
hindsight.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
the
question
of
whether
in
defining
gross
income,
you
--
this
cost
a
good
sold
item
in
there.
now
here
is
what
--
as
i
understand
it,
what
the
respondent
--
his
argument
is.
under
section
22
(a),
that
is
the
general
definition
of
gross
income.
it
--
they
set
out
certain
specific
items
if
dividends
are
includible
in
gross
income
and
gains
or
profits
--
from
any
source,
whatsoever.
now,
the
respondent
takes
that
word
“gains”
and
he
goes
over
--
over
to
section
111
of
the
code.
now,
that
section
provides
that
in
determining
the
gain
from
a
sale
of
property,
there's
a
difference
between
the
gross
proceeds
from
a
sale
and
the
cost
of
the
property.
now,
he
takes
two
sections
of
the
code,
22
and
111
and
says
they
that
in
enacting
section
275
(c),
congress
was
intending
to
cover
this
situation.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
when
congress
enacted
275
(c),
they
weren't
concerned
about
section
22
(a)
or
section
111,
they
were
concerned
with
omits
from.
now,
the
reason
they
use
gross
income
is
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
generally
synonymous
with
gross
receipts.
and
the
majority
of
tax
returns,
the
income
and
the
receipts
are
the
same.
that's
what's
includible.
that's
--
and
from
that,
you
take
off
figures.
now,
it
so
happens
that
in
the
case
of
a
manufacturing
concern
that
you
take
your
gross
receipts
and
you
subtract
from
that,
your
cost
to
good
sold
and
from
an
accounting
standpoint,
you
come
up
with
gross
income
but
the
only
thing
includible
in
gross
income
are
the
receipts.
the
cost
are
offset
items.
you
subtract
from
that.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
sir?
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
right.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
well,
that
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
this
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
well,
that
is
what
we
consider
one
of
the
--
the
strongest
--
the
things
we
rely
on
for
our
construction.
in
other
words,
under
the
tax
laws
or
accounting
laws,
we
start
off
with
gross
receipts.
you
subtract
from
that
in
the
case
of
a
manufacturing
concern,
the
cost
of
the
property
being
sold
and
then
you
come
up
with
gross
income.
now,
under
our
tax
laws,
your
advertising,
your
rent,
and
so
forth
are
specifically
authorized
as
deductions
by
law.
you
subtract
those
from
your
gross
income
to
get
your
net
income.
now,
we
feel
because
the
statute
obviously
doesn't
cover
those
items.
they
can
be
overstated.
it
doesn't
matter
how
far
they're
overstated.
the
deductions
authorized
by
section
23
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
they
conceded
as
a
must,
and
we
say
that
the
cost
item,
which
is
similar
in
nature
to
those
items,
they're
both
expenditures
that
you
report
on
a
return
and
to
get
your
benefits,
you've
got
to
report
them.
we
--
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
--
just
because
it
was
a
cost
item,
for
the
statute
to
apply.
it
--
it's
inconsistent.
if
they
were
worried
about
that
type
of
an
error,
they
would
have
gone
under
--
include
the
deductions
that
you
take
from
gross
income.
did
i
make
myself
clear
on
that?
mr.
a.
robert
doll
we
think
that
when
you
stand
back
and
look
at
this
statute,
what
congress
really
meant
omits
from
gross
income.
now,
omits
means
to
leave
out
items
of
receipt.
that's
actually
what
they
had
in
mind.
now,
and
there
are
examples
i
submit
in
the
committee
reports
are
exactly
that
kind
of
a
situation.
take
for
example
in
the
senate
report,
on
page
16
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
for
instance,
a
case
might
arise
where
a
taxpayer
failed
to
report
a
dividend
because
he
was
erroneously
advised
by
the
officers
of
the
corporation
that
it
was
paid
out
of
capital
or
he
might
report
his
income
for
one
year,
an
item
of
income
which
properly
belonged
in
another
year.
now,
a
dividend
is
a
receipt.
that's
exactly
what
congress
was
aiming
at.
now
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
sir?
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that
is
our
position,
sir,
that
they
were
aiming
at
left
out
receipts.
that's
what
this
statute
was
intended
to
--
to
give
the
commissioner
a
longer
period
when
the
taxpayer
left
out
items
of
receipt
from
his
income.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
from
his
--
from
his
gross
income.
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
yes,
sir.
but
we
think
is
that
--
in
--
in
the
latter
situation,
the
non-dividend
situation,
the
receipts
as
you
say
are
in
there
and
you
subtracted
some
cost
from
those
receipts
to
come
up
from
the
gain
of
the
sale
of
the
property.
now,
we
feel
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
--
was
not
concerned
about
errors
resulting
from
the
overstated
cost
items.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
because
they
were
only
concerned
with
omissions
from
the
left
out
we
feel.
they
--
they
weren't
concerned
--
in
other
words
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
--
they
weren't
concerned
with
all
errors.
it
was
simply
from
left
out
items
of
receipt.
now
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
well,
that's
the
respondent's
case.
that's
his
argument.
we
think
there's
a
big
difference.
we
think
it
--
that
when
you
read
these
committee
reports
and
when
you
take
the
normal
statutory
language
that
--
that
the
case
that
you
mentioned
there
was
no
omission
there.
it
--
the
income
was
understated.
we
will
admit
that
in
this
case,
gross
income
was
understated
but
we
deny
that
there
was
anything
omitted
from
gross
income.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that
is
correct,
sir.
our
cost
were
overstated
and
our
--
our
gross
income
was
understated
but
we
--
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
correct.
but
we
--
we
don't
think
because
our
gross
income
was
understated.
there
was
no
omission
from
gross
income.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
robert
doll
we
--
we
admit
that.
that's
true.
one
further
point,
if
i
may,
that
the
respondent
has
stated
that
there
is
a
long
--
that
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
judicial
history
that
there've
been
in
a
long
period
of
time
where
the
cases
adopted
one
view.
we
--
we
don't
think
that
is
true
in
this
particular
case,
this
type
of
situation.
the
cases
by
and
large
that
the
respondent
relies
on,
the
real
issue
in
that
case
was
where
there
were
on
a
schedule
attached
to
a
return,
statements
to
the
effect
that
certain
alleged
receipts
were
nontaxable.
the
courts
in
the
early
cases
held
that
that
was
not
a
sufficient
disclosure
and
that
therefore,
that
was
an
omission.
i
think
the
--
that
type
of
situation
would
then
--
cured
by
the
1954
law
in
the
second
subsection.
we
think
it
actually
--
the
--
the
issue
didn't
come
to
our
head,
really,
until
the
uptegrove
case,
which
was
the
first
conflicting
case
with
the
reis
case
as
far
as
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
go.
thank
you.
