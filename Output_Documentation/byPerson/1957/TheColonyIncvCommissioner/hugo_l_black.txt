can
the
tax
form
set
out
when
you
get
--
get
down
to
a
point
where
you
have
income,
where
do
you
get
the

what

what
is
in
the

that
says
gross
income
in
connection
with
the

of

why

why
is
that
(inaudible)
justice

how
can
you
go
from
the
fact
if
they
mentioned
dividend
in
the
report
and
make
the
next
step
to
say
that's
what
they
were
aiming
at
this
implication

gross
income?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you've
made
this
report
for
gross
income,
you
first
took
all
--
you
talk
what
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
down
and
your
report
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
receipts
that
you
put
down
there
so
far
as
the
gross
income
was
concerned,
was
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
what's
the
difference
in
that
and
the
dividend.
either
one
of
them
has
to
put
in
as
a
part
of
your
gross
income.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
if
--
if
it's
gross
income,
and
that's
probably
the
gross
income,
the
gross
income
whether
up
or
down,
according
to
the
amounts
you
put,
you
(inaudible)
we
use
to
compute
the
gross

(inaudible)
justice

why
wouldn't
it
wanted
that
as
much
as
anything
else?
you
may
have
25%
error.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
error.(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
if
you
leave
it
out
by
figuring
it,
instead
of
just
by
not
figuring
it,
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
entered
--
when
you
entered
the
list
on
this
report
as
i
just
read
it,
it's
made
up
very
wrong.
you
entered
a
list
provided
that
you
had
received
as
your
gross
income.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
entered
a
certain
figure
reached
by
calculations
on
a
basis
which
was
not
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
put
that
in
there
and
the
government
lost
a
tax
on
it
by
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
it
was
not
included,
that
the
right
figure
was
not
included
in
the
list
of
gross
item,
the
gross
income
you
received.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
deduction
comes
in
quite
a
different
way.
that
comes
after
you
figured
up
all
your
gross
income.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
you
call
it
understated
or
not
is
what
--
as
much
as
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
much

it
was.
