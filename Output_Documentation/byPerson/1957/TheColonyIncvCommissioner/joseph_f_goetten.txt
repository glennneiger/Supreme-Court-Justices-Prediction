mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
agree
that
the
single
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
general
three-year
statute
of
limitations
bars
assessment
and
collection
of
tax
deficiencies
admittedly
due,
as
the
taxpayer
contends
or
whether
if
the
courts
below
held
the
five-year
statute
of
limitations
applies.
the
important
facts
are
not
disputed.
the
taxpayer
corporation
in
this
case
understated
its
gain
from
sales
of
property
by
more
than
25%
of
the
amount
reported
as
gross
income
in
its
return.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
yes.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
in
the
main
part,
it
consisted
of
allocating
to
the
various
lots
sold
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
a
waterworks
that
the
taxpayer
had
constructed
to
furnish
water
to
these
various
residential
lots
it
was
selling.
the
difficulty
with
the
taxpayer
adding
that
to
the
cost
basis
of
the
lots
was
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
transfer
that
to
the
purchasers
of
the
lots
or
to
a
--
a
nonprofit
corporation
to
hold
it
for
them.
the
taxpayer
retained
title
to
the
waterworks
and
sold
the
water
to
the
lots
that
was
there
were
not
included.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
that's
right,
your
honor.
he
did
a
portion
wrongfully
because
he
kept
title
that
was
still
his
waterworks.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
well,
i
think
it's
conceded
for
purposes
of
this
case,
erroneously.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
well,
he
sold
the
lots
in
three
different
years,
your
honor.
two
years
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
yes,
he
allocated
--
he
sold
some
of
the
lots
in
the
two
years
before
the
court
at
this
time,
19
fiscal
years
ending
at
1946
and
1947,
and
then
he
sold
some
in
1950.
he
allocated
the
total
cost
of
the
waterworks
to
the
various
lots
as
sold,
a
proportionate
part.
now
this
understatement
of
gain
here
resulted
from
overstating
the
cost
or
adjusted
basis
of
the
lot
sold.
and
accordingly,
part
of
the
gain
from
the
sales
of
the
lots
was
not
correctly
shown
as
gain,
but
was
erroneously
shown
as
a
return
of
capital
investment
in
the
property.
now
the
statute
to
be
construed
in
this
case
is
set
forth
at
pages
3
to
4
of
the
government's
brief.
it's
very
short
and
very
simple,
section
275
(c)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
it
provides
that
the
commissioner
will
have
five
years
after
a
return
is
filed
within
which
to
assess
or
collect
deficiencies.
“if
the
taxpayer
omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
properly
includible
therein
which
is
in
excess
of
25
per
centum
of
the
amount
of
gross
income
stated
in
the
return.”
now,
taxpayer
would
emphasize
the
world
“omits”
in
that
statute,
but
the
word
“omits”
standing
alone
is
meaningless.
it
immediately
suggest
the
questions
“omits
what
from
what?”
and
the
statute
supplies
the
answer.
it
says
omits
from
gross
income
an
amount
properly
includible
therein.
now,
gross
income
is
a
term
of
art.
it's
defined
by
statute.
so
defined,
it
expressly
includes
gains
from
the
sales
of
property.
gain
from
the
sale
of
property
in
turn
is
also
defined
by
statute
as
the
excess
of
the
sales
proceeds
or
amount
realized
over
the
cost
or
adjusted
basis
of
the
property
sold.
applying
these
statutory
definitions
here
gain
from
the
sale
of
property
is
“properly
includible”
and
“gross
income.”
total
sales
proceeds
or
total
receipts
are
not
properly
includible.
accordingly
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
an
omission
from
gross
income
of
a
part
of
the
gain
from
the
sales
of
property
is
an
omission
of
an
amount
properly
includible
therein.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
that
would
not
be
an
understatement
of
gross
income
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
well,
congress
could
have
used
the
terms
“omission
of
net
income”
or
omissions
from
the
tax
itself,
more
than
25%.
it
did
not
use
that
language.
it
has
not
--
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history,
the
hearings
or
anything,
why
they
chose
the
term
“gross
income.”
but
i
think
there's
a
very
good
obvious
reason.
gross
income
is
the
basic
figure.
there
are
very
few
computations
in
arriving
at
gross
income.
once
you
get
to
net
income,
there
are
a
whole
series
of
computations
involved.
there
are
even
more
when
you
get
to
the
tax
itself.
accordingly,
if
congress
had
talked
about
a
25%
omission
from
net
income
as
stated
on
the
return,
it
would
be
perhaps
embodying
many
mathematical
errors
of
the
taxpayer
in
computing
his
tax.
by
picking
gross
income
stated
in
the
return,
it
picked
a
figure
which
does
not
include
many
computations.
it
does
include
a
few.
i
think
that
is
perhaps
the
--
the
real
answer
to
why
the
statute
is
drafted
the
way
it
is.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
no.
your
honor,
form
1040
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
--
or
whatever
the
form
is,
contains
no
specific
item
labeled
“gross
income”
and
it's
not
our
position
as
the
taxpayer
maintains
that
if
gross
income
is
correctly
stated
in
the
various
schedules
set
up
for
various
types
of
gross
income
such
as
dividends,
interests,
hence
received
and
so
forth,
if
there's
any
error
in
carrying
that
over
to
the
phase
of
the
return
or
any
error
adding
the
figure
up,
we
do
not
contend
that's
an
omission
from
gross
income.
the
statute
talks
about
gross
income
stated
in
the
return.
it's
our
position
that
means
stated
in
the
schedules
of
various
types
of
gross
income
and
to
get
back
to
concealment
if
an
item
is
not
stated
as
gross
income
or
if
it's
stated
as
a
--
an
excess
of
cost
basis.
the
commissioner
is
not
familiar
entirely
with
the
facts
that
took
place.
he
--
it
is
concealed.
it
is
not
disclose.
the
important
factor
is
that
it
must
be
disclosed
as
gross
income.
now,
it
--
it's
also
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
this
statutory
provision
that
a
taxpayer
omits
within
the
meaning
of
the
section
when
he
understates
his
gross
income
on
his
return.
now,
the
committee
reports
are
set
forth
at
pages
19
to
20
of
the
government's
brief
and
they
both
refer
to
this
law
in
the
following
language,
the
change
enlarges
the
scope
of
this
provision
to
include
cases
wherein
the
taxpayer
understates
gross
income
on
its
return
by
an
amount
which
is
an
excess
of
25%
of
the
gross
income
stated
in
the
return.
they
clearly
meant
“omits”
to
include
the
word
“understates.”
now
it
is
true
as
taxpayer
has
pointed
out
that
the
committee
reports
giving
examples
also
go
on
to
describe
omissions
as
a
leaving
out
or
a
failure
to
disclose.
but
when
this
language
is
read
in
the
full
context
of
the
committee
reports,
it's
clear
that
it
refers
to
a
failure
to
disclose
as
gross
income
or
a
leaving
out
of
items
of
gross
income.
none
of
the
examples
given
refers
to
a
failure
to
disclose
or
leaving
out
of
gross
receipts,
gross
proceeds
of
sale
or
anything
other
than
gross
income.
now
there
are
some
cases
such
as
salary,
dividends
where
gross
income
and
gross
receipts
may
be
synonymous,
but
none
of
the
examples
given
is
an
example
of
a
gross
receipt
that
is
not
gross
income.
and
the
statute
proceeds
to
provide
when
the
omission
from
gross
income
of
an
amount
properly
includible
therein
shall
be
crucial,
and
i
think
this
is
the
really
important
part
of
the
statute.
it
is
crucial
only
if
the
omitted
amount
is
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
amount
of
gross
income
stated
in
the
return,
and
is
thus
apparent
that
congress
was
primarily
concerned
with
a
relative
size
of
the
omission.
and
i
should
point
out
here
that
this
very
provision
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
not
thinking
in
terms
of
how
long
will
the
commissioner
need
to
catch
up
with
the
particular
error
here
because
it
obviously
takes
him
just
as
long
to
find
an
omission
of
a
smaller
amount
from
gross
income
as
it
does
to
find
an
omission
of
a
larger
amount
from
gross
income.
the
committee
reports
make
it
clear
that
congress
merely
decided
that
taxpayers
failing
to
state
as
gross
income,
relatively
large
amounts
which
should
be
included
therein
should
run
the
risk
of
the
longer
statute
of
limitations.
congress
was
concerned
with
results,
not
causes,
with
relatively
large
omissions
and
not
that
those
may
have
been
honest
omissions.
in
fact,
the
committee
reports
show
that
congress
intended
to
cover
honest
mistakes
in
this
section.
dishonest
mistakes
are
covered
somewhere
else.
and
it
meant
to
require
taxpayers
to
run
the
risk
of
the
longer
limitations
even
if
they
omitted
the
doubtful
item
from
gross
income.
in
other
words,
it's
all
--
it's
frequently
a
difficult
question
is
to
whether
a
particular
item
of
gross
income
should
be
reported
in
one
year
or
another
year.
and
if
you
leave
it
out,
you
don't
report
it
as
gross
income
for
a
particular
year,
it's
an
omission
within
the
meaning
of
this
section
and
the
committee
reports
give
that
specific
example.
in
fact,
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
house
bill
was
amended
by
the
senate.
the
house
bill
would
have
provided
no
statute
of
limitations
where
it
was
the
25
--
an
omission
in
excess
to
25%.
the
senate
thought
that
that
was
too
harsh
where
the
error
was
an
honest
error
and
that
applied
your
--
limitations
should
be
provided.
this
last
part
of
the
statute
also
provides
the
measure
for
the
amount
omitted.
it
speaks
of
20
--
in
excess
of
25%
of
the
amount
of
gross
income
stated
in
the
return,
and
as
i
have
pointed
out,
the
only
place
where
gross
income
is
fully
stated
in
the
return
is
in
the
schedules.
and
our
position
has
been
misconceived
by
taxpayer.
it
was
misconceived
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
uptegrove
case
where
they
say
that
the
commissioner's
position
is
that
if
the
final
figure
in
the
gross
income
computation
is
understated
then
there
has
been
an
omission
from
gross
income
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that
is
not
the
commissioner's
position
and
has
never
been.
if
there
is
an
error
in
transposing
an
amount
of
gross
income
from
a
schedule
to
the
phase
of
the
return,
but
the
amount
is
fully
disclosed
and
is
disclosed
as
gross
income
in
the
schedule,
there's
been
no
omission.
if
there's
a
mathematical
error,
that
is
an
error
in
adding
up
the
figures
on
the
phase
of
the
return,
that
is
not
on
omission
from
gross
incomes.
we
don't
look
at
the
last
figure.
we
look
at
each
figure
which
describes
a
particular
type
of
gross
income
either
--
either
received
or
approved
by
a
particular
taxpayer.
and
that
that
is
clearly
the
commissioner's
position
is
made
clear
by
two
factors.
first
of
all,
the
commissioner
has
an
old
statute
of
limitations
problem
with
respect
to
mathematical
errors
on
the
phase
of
the
return.
there
is
a
100%
mathematical
verification
of
returns.
there
are
so
many
returns
filed.
the
commissioner
cannot
audit
all
of
them,
a
relatively
small
number,
perhaps
10%
are
audited.
but
there
is
a
mathematical
verification
of
returns
and
the
commissioner
needs
not
--
not
even
three
years
to
accomplish
that
objective.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
fact
that
there
is
--
even
in
the
court
a
special
treatment
for
mathematical
errors.
they
are
treated
separately,
section
272
(f),
which
was
added
to
the
code
at
the
same
in
1934.
at
the
same
time,
this
statute
was
added
provide
its
--
provides
that
the
commissioner
does
not
have
to
send
the
90-day
notice
of
his
determination
of
a
deficiency
in
the
case
of
a
mathematical
error.
if
it's
in
the
taxpayer's
favor,
he
merely
sends
him
a
letter
with
a
check.
if
it's
in
the
commissioner's
favor.
he
sends
a
letter
and
tells
him
to
remit.
and
accordingly,
our
position
is
that
there
is
an
omission
from
gross
income
under
the
terms
and
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
whenever
the
gross
income
stated
in
the
various
schedules
of
the
return
is
deflated
by
more
than
25%.
now
we
submit
that
that
would
be
the
logical
construction
of
this
statute
even
if
the
proposition
were
coming
up
way
back
in
1934.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
no,
your
honor,
not
if
they're
in
the
deduction,
if
they're
treated
as
a
deduction.
there
are
certain
instances
where
by
rulings,
the
commissioner
allows
depreciation
to
be
taken
out
in
arriving
at
a
certain
item
that
goes
in
the
gross
income
schedule.
but
ordinarily,
depreciation
is
a
deduction
item
and
as
such,
an
overstated
deduction
item
would
not
be
an
understatement
of
gross.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
between
a
deduction
item
and
--
and
a
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
because
congress
has
used
the
term
gross
income,
it's
written
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
it
--
it
expresses
concern
with
omissions
from
gross
income
of
amounts
properly
includible
therein.
it
could
have
said
net
income
and
caught
overstated
deductions.
it
didn't
say
so.
it
could
have
--
it
could
have
said
omissions
from
the
tax
itself
and
even
brought
more
than
understated
items
of
gross
and
overstated
items
of
deduction.
but
i
think
the
logical
reason
why
they're
not
doing
it
is
that
then,
if
they
talked
about
net
income
stated
in
the
return
or
the
tax
reported
in
the
return
and
there
are
frequently
errors,
mathematical
errors,
it
would
have
encompassed
that
within
the
statute
and
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
do
that.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
by
reason
of
the
statutory
definition
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
of
gross
income
and
a
gain
from
sale.
there
are
two
definitions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
if,
your
honor
--
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly
that
you
included
the
cost
of
the
trailer
in
your
cost
basis
of
the
property
and
subtracted
that
in
the
writing
that
you
gained
from
sell,
my
answer
is
yes.
and
i
think
that
congress
intended
to
cover
mistakes
by
that
and
the
five-year
statute
has
made
crystal
clear
by
the
committee
reports,
which
i
previously
referred
to
on
pages
19
to
20
of
our
--
our
brief.
in
changing
the
senate
bill,
which
would
have
provided
an
unlimited
period
for
assessment
in
this
type
of
case,
the
house
said
--
or
i
mean,
the
house
bill,
the
senate
said,
“your
committee
is
in
general
accord
with
the
policy
expressed
in
this
section
of
the
house
bill.
however,
it
is
believed
that
in
the
case
of
a
taxpayer
who
makes
an
honest
mistake,
it
would
be
unfair
to
keep
the
statute
open
indefinitely.
for
instance,
a
case
might
arise
where
a
taxpayer
failed
to
report
a
dividend
because
he
was
erroneously
advised
by
the
officers
of
the
corporation
that
it
was
paid
out
of
capital
or
he
might
report
his
income
for
one
year,
an
item
of
income
which
properly
belonged
in
another
year,
which
is
often
a
very
difficult
question.
accordingly,
your
committee
has
provided
for
a
five-year
statute
in
such
cases."
in
other
words,
they
intended
to
cover
honest
mistakes
here,
your
honor.
close
questions
like
in
what
year
does
the
income
go
and
you
put
it
in
a
wrong
year,
it
amounts
to
a
25%
omission,
the
five-year
statute
applies.
it's
not
because
it
takes
the
commissioner
longer
to
catch
the
error.
it's
just
that
they
felt
because
of
the
adverse
effect
on
the
revenue,
a
person
making
a
mistake,
an
honest
mistake
that
large,
should
run
the
risk
of
a
longer
period.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
yes,
your
honor,
even
though
it
is
because
the
--
it's
often
a
very
--
not
only
a
legal
conclusion
but
a
very
difficult
legal
conclusion
as
to
--
to
determine
in
which
year
an
item
of
income
should
go.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
even
all
--
all
the
facts
have
been
revealed.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
exactly,
your
honor.
we're
--
we're
trying
to
collect
something
that's
actually
due
here
and
we're
dealing
with
something
technical
as
statute
of
limitations
and
whether
it
bars
and
accordingly,
any
statute
of
limitations
as
to
a
certain
extent
arbitrary.
congress
has
set
one
here.
we
submit
it
issues,
plain
language
in
setting
that
statute,
the
legislative
history
is
crystal
clear
and
you
would
reach
this
conclusion
even
if
you
didn't
have
a
long
history
of
an
administrative
and
judicial
construction,
but
you
do
have
that.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1934
and
the
treasury
regulations
which
were
issued
at
that
time
under
the
1934
act
provided
that
if
they
are
submitted
from
the
gross
income
stated
in
the
return,
they
say
nothing
about
any
computation
or
disclosure
or
anything
else,
if
they're
submitted
from
the
gross
income
stated
in
the
return,
an
--
an
amount
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
omits,
i
--
i
say
it
means
leaves
out
an
item
of
gross
income,
fails
to
disclose
an
item
as
gross
income
or
understates
gross
income.
those
are
the
terms
the
committee
used,
i
think,
in
the
same
context,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
both
in
the
sense
of
understate
--
yes,
the
--
the
committee
reports
used
it
as
understates
and
when
they
also
go
on
to
use
synonymous
terms
such
as
leave
out
or
fail
to
--
fail
to
disclose,
they
say
leave
out
items
of
gross
income,
fail
to
disclose
as
gross
income.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
subtraction.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
it's
the
alleged
cost
in
this
case,
but
it's
an
erroneous
cost
basis.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
which
is
labeled
gross
revenue,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
the
statute
requires
it.
i
--
i
think
you
have
to
distort
the
statute
to
come
to
any
other
conclusion.
and
as
i
would
like
to
point
out,
the
regulations
interpreted,
the
1934
code
provision
as
applying
to
an
omission
from
gross
income
stated
in
the
return,
it
had
to
be
stated
as
such,
those
regulations
were
adopted
under
the
1934
act.
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1936,
1938
and
1939.
the
same
regulations
were
repeated
under
each
of
those
statutes.
i
think
if
congress
had
disagreed
with
that
construction,
they
would
have
said
so.
moreover,
the
judicial
construction
of
this
statute
was
entirely
consistent
for
19
years
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
from
1934
to
1953,
19
years,
this
legislation
was
unanimously
construed
by
the
courts
as
applying
to
omissions
from
gross
income
as
defined
by
statute.
the
tax
court
in
the
malloy
case,
the
second
circuit
in
the
ketcham
case,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
foster's
estate
case,
the
sixth
circuit
in
ewald
and
reis,
and
the
ninth
in
the
o'bryan
case
so
held.
we
think
if
there
was
any
doubt
initially,
it
should
have
been
put
to
rest
by
these
19
years
of
consistent
administrative
and
judicial
construction,
and
this
brings
us
to
our
final
point
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
in
1953,
the
first
circuit
decided
uptegrove
and
i'll
tell
you
what
the
basis
of
their
conclusion
was.
first,
they
misstated
the
commissioner's
position.
they
said
that
the
commissioner's
position
is
that
income
is
omitted
if
the
ultimate
figure
in
the
computation
of
gross
income
is
understated.
that
has
never
been
the
commissioner's
position.
then
they
got
into
the
word
“computation”
and
they
wrote
that
into
the
statute.
they
wrote
the
statute
as
if
it
read
and
an
omission
from
the
computation
of
gross
income.
it
doesn't
say
that.
they
had
to
go
further
and
write
in
something
else
because
if
you
talk
nearly
about
an
omission
from
the
computation,
you
might
have
been
omitting
a
negative
item
rather
than
a
plus
item.
so
they
have
to
write
in
an
omission
from
the
computation
of
gross
income
of
a
plus
item
such
as
a
receipt
item
or
a
taxable
receipt,
for
instance,
if
it's
a
dividend,
taxable
or
taxable
dividend
rather
than
nontaxable
dividend.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
also
defined
by
regulation
that
gross
income
in
the
case
of
a
merchandising
or
manufacturing
concern
means
gross
receipts
less
the
direct
cost
of
good
sold.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
well,
i
don't
read
the
opinion.
i
--
if
that
was
a
cost
of
receipts
case,
your
honor,
it
was
exactly
like
this
one
and
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
--
and
he
was
worried
about
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
well,
it's
gain
from
sale,
if
your
honor
please,
gain
from
the
sale
of
property
and
that
itself
is
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
yes,
but
this
is
a
specific
source.
it
is
from
sale
property
that's
undisputed
in
section
111
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
judge
hastie
with
all
due
respect,
pulled
many
of
the
statements
from
the
legislative
history
out
of
context.
he
relied
on
the
words
leave
out
and
fail
to
disclose,
but
if
those
are
read
in
the
full
context
to
the
committee
reports,
it's
clear
that
they
may
leave
out
items
of
gross
income
or
failed
to
disclose
as
gross
income.
and
--
and
we
think
therefore,
that
since
the
statute
says
what
gained
from
sales
shall
comprised,
you
follow
the
statutory
language
and
these
are
omissions
from
gross
income.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
because
for
instance,
gross
income
does
not
include
a
nontaxable
dividend
and
that's
one
--
if
your
honor
please,
that's
one
of
the
beauties
of
this
statute,
by
talking
about
omissions
from
gross
income.
they
avoid
all
these
many
detailed
computations
and
they
also
avoid
the
problem
of
--
in
the
case
for
instance
of
a
dividend,
whether
it's
taxable
or
not.
if
it
goes
in
gross
income,
it's
a
taxable
dividend,
so
if
you'll
omit
something,
it
is
not
a
taxable
dividend
such
as
a
declaration
of
a
common
stock
dividend
and
uncommon
stock,
then
you
have
no
problem
on
the
statute.
it's
not
an
omission.
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
your
honor,
unfortunately,
that
has
not
been
printed.
there
is
no
sharp
dividing
line.
the
--
the
returns
in
this
case
are
in
the
record
and
the
first
one
is
on
page
27.
and
the
first
general
heading
is
gross
income
and
then
item
15
is
a
figure
called
total
income,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
is
not
either
total
gross
income
or
total
net
income.
it's
a
hybrid
figure
and
i
can
show
by
example,
item
10,
rents
received.
that
is
gross
income,
but
turned
down
to
12
(b)
net
gain
from
sale
or
exchange
of
property
other
than
capital
assets.
that
is
not
a
gross
income
figure.
it's
a
net
income
figure
and
there's
a
good
reason
why
they
put
it
up
here
and
take
it
out
this
way.
ordinarily,
a
person
who
is
not
in
the
business
of
selling
property
can't
take
a
general
deduction
for
property,
expenses
of
selling
property.
this
net
gain
figure
that
goes
on
the
face
of
the
return
as
subtracted
from
it,
not
only
the
cost
of
good
sold
but
the
expenses
of
sale.
and
unless
they're
grouped
together,
the
sale
itself
and
the
expenses
of
sale
as
they
are
in
the
schedule
called
for,
schedule
b,
which
unfortunately
was
on
the
back
of
this
form
and
hasn't
been
printed.
unless
they're
put
together,
a
person
checking
the
form
has
no
idea
whether
the
expenses
of
sale
are
deductible
or
not.
it's
unfortunate
that
this
form
is
drafted
so
as
to
help
the
--
the
people
that
have
to
go
over
and
check
it.
it
would
be
better
for
the
lawyer
to
broke
--
mr.
joseph
f.
goetten
well,
it
helps
the
taxpayer
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
that
it
makes
this
computation
as
easy
--
easily
--
as
easy
as
possible
but
it
doesn't
break
it
down
for
the
lawyer
in
terms
of
gross
income,
adjusted
gross
income,
net
income
tax.
that
is
not
done
on
the
form.
