m.
harlan
are
there
any
suggestion
that
the
jurisdiction
might
be
predicated
on
the
other
sections
to
rules,
subsection
of
the
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
under
your
view
of
it,
that
this
case
went
back,
goes
as
to
whom
there
was
no
jurisdiction
were
weeded
out,
would
there
then
be
a
retrial
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
the
district
court
of
the
merits
as
to
those
over
whom
there
would
be
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
could
sue
black,
couldn't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me,
you
said
8f,
i
don't
find
8f.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
--
isn't
your
point,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
the
jurisdictional
purposes
is
a
distinction
between
a
complaint
or
the
recovery
is
sought
in
a
common
fund
and
a
complaint
that
alleges
a
cause
of
action,
the
damage
is
based
on
the
theory
of
impressive
--
constructed
trust.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
would
have
been?
