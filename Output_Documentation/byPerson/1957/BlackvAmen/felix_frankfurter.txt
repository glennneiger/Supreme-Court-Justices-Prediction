justice

the
party
being
asked
--
may
i
ask
where
in
the
record
if
you
can
turn
to
quickly,
the
explicit,
specific
relief
asked
by
the
non-diversity
interveners,
appears?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
was
the
specific
relief
and
that's
still
justice
douglas'
question.
you
said
they
--
their
relief
was
directed
to
a
personal
claim
for
themselves,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
where
--
may
i
--
is
it
in
the
--
is
it
in
the
record
that
i
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sometimes
doing
a
falsity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
see
exactly
what
it
is
the
interveners
asked
for.
did
they
all
ask
for
the
same
kind
of
thing
in
the
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
is
relevant
to
the
question
put
to
you
by
justice
harlan
to
which
will
come
in
later
to
your
arguments
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
plaintiff
who
has
standing
without
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
plaintiff
who
has
standing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
have
no
standing
according
to
your
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
21.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
sort
of
incorporate
by
reference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
all
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
come
to
answer
justice
harlan's
question,
you
will
deal
with
the
extent
to
which
they
joined
in
asking
for
corporate
relief
rather
than
an
individual's
relief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
acheson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
which
i
also
addressed
to
mr.
smith,
let
me
see
if
--
answering,
come
to
his
term.
there
were
some
25
individual
--
how
many,
something
like
25
individual
plaintiff,
something,
whatever
they
were.
of
these,
how
many
were
unquestionably
set
--
how
many
satisfied
diversity?
two?
three?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
unquestionably
on
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
clear
--
clearly
two
do
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
does.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
question
i
want
to
put
to
you.
if
they
come
in
--
if
they
come
in
on
the
assumption
that
an
allegation
of
diversity
was
unnecessary
because
of
the
view
of
the
court
assuming
your
position
is
the
one
the
court
took
below.
in
view
of
the
court
that
this
is
23
(3)
etcetera,
did
they
come
in
on
that
basis
and
therefore,
their
counsel
being
elegant
pleaders
didn't
have
to
set
forth
diversity
of
jurisdiction?
if
they
did
that,
then
we
can't
assume,
assuming
you
raised
the
point
below,
that
diversity
jurisdiction
does
exist
unless
it's
affirmatively
asserted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
as
to
each
one
of
them,
there
has
to
be
an
examination
on
the
assumption
of
your
argument
that
--
that
if
it's
diversity,
if
you
are
right
about
this
particular
class
--
spurious
class
and
each
one
would
have
affirmatively
to
maintain
this
jurisdiction.
and
on
the
record,
you
say,
since
the
contrary
theory
was
the
basis
of
this
litigation,
that
would
have
to
be
considered
de
novo
down
below,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
two
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
are
two
who
are
plainly
not
and
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
mr.
smith's
theory
is
right
then
there
was
no
need
of
alleging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
he's
not
right,
there
must
be
an
affirmative
reconsideration
of
this
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
accept
as
conveying
the
idea
of
interdependence
that
you
can't
decide
a's
lawsuit
without
--
if
the
federal
is
thereby
deciding
b,
is
that
what
you
mean
by
interdependence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
at
the
beginning
of
the
suit
that
you
can't
say,
"jones
defrauded
a
without
necessarily
determining
that
he
did
or
didn't
before
b."
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
heard
it
said
that,
the
court
below,
that
some
were
defrauded
and
some
were
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
some
of
the
claimants
weren't
--
that
some
of
the
plaintiffs
were
defrauded,
the
court
below
found,
and
some
were
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fellow
who
was
--
suppose
some
of
the
people
in
this
who
were
plaintiffs,
you
haven't
come
in,
couldn't
they
brought
separate
suits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
by
the
fund
is
that
property
of
money,
if
he
was
judgment
--
if
he
was
judgment
proof
of
black,
isn't
that
all
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course,
the
court
always
has
to
get
hold
of
a
read,
whatever
it
is,
whether
it's
money
or
a
share.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
know
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
know
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
story
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
respect
diversity
and
citizenship
as
scrupulously
as
i
have
to
but
not
beyond
that
(inaudible).
and
you
well
pointed
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
as
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
smith
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
i
ask
whether
in
this
case,
if
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
plaintiff
interveners
had
not
come
in,
have
stayed
out,
would
they
had
been
foreclosed
by
any
adjudication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say,
one
of
these
non-intervening
interveners
that
i
hypothesized,
if
he
stayed
out,
couldn't
sue,
even
in
the
state
court
or
assuming
there
is
diversity
in
the
federal
court
and
get
a
judgment
for
fraud
against
black?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
tomorrow
to
state
what
follows
if
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
is
to
stand,
namely
what
the
district
court
would
do.
and
assuming
a
judgment
would
be
entered
without
any
further
proceeding,
what
kind
of
a
judgment
the
district
court
will
enter
on
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
you
can
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
smith,
you
can
sustain
your
judgment
of
course
on
any
ground
on
which
you
can
sustain
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
ground
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
sustaining
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
they
only
added
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
said
in
terms
--
i
repeat
you've
--
you've
been
sustained
in
those
judgments
on
anything
that
sustained.
and
while
their
claims
and
demands
were
separate,
they
allege
substantially.
now,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
requires
us
hereafter,
to
look
at
all
the
briefs
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
counsel
below
to
find
out
what
they
were
addressing
themselves
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
that
sometimes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
the
petitioner
says,
is
what
i
read
in
the
opinion.
