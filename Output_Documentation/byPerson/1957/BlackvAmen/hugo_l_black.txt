justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
justice
douglas.
suppose
there
are
25
people
who
filed
a
suit,
separate
(inaudible)
suit
like
this.
submitted,
they
all
trying
to
get
to
the
federal
court
by
reason
of
diversity.
one
other
person
comes
in
and
he
is
not
entitled
to
get
in
by
diversity,
he
gets
in
as
an
intervener.
are
you
claiming
that
in
the
circumstances,
the
25
would
lose
their
judgment
over
to
one
person
who
intervened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
he
does
come
in,
i
have
in
the
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
dismissed
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
is
--
we
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
smith?
that
the
plaintiff
seems
to
allege
what
you
have
been
insisting
on
that
impressing
of
the
trust
by
reason
of
fraud
and
as
their
prayer
calls
for
relief
on
that
basis,
what
position
did
the
defendant
has
taken
to
answer
to
that
charge
as
to
the
court
was
arising
on
the
count
of
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
claim
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
claim
that
that
phase
of
the
bill
failed
to
state
any
cause
of
action
on
which
relief
would
be
granted,
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
they
just
deny
the
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
they
just
denied
the
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
no
--
there
seems
to
have
been
no
sharply,
contest
at
issue
between
the
parties
that
i've
seen
yet
in
here
as
to
that
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
allegations
brought
to
the
assumption
that
if
you
could
prove
your
fraud,
it
wouldn't
bring
about
the
--
show
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
an
ex
maleficio.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
he
--
is
he
right
in
relying
on
that
if
he
is
--
if
his
petition
is
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
--
would
in
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
--
just
one
more
question
but
i'm
not
sure
about
one
point.
the
complaint
alleges
facts
which
are
supposed
was
their
nature
for
arguments
that
there
was
a
trust
fund
created
and
that
there
--
this
trust
fund
is
shown
in
the
bill.
assuming
that
all
the
parties
were,
this
is
if
they
were
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
rest
on
the
basis
that
the
complaint
just
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
in
that
respect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--and
i
assume
if
it
did
--
if
it
did
show
upon
as
they
alleged
and
as
they
prayed
for
that
they
wouldn't
have
to
be
diversity,
would
be
among
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
phase
of
the
complaint
i'm
talking
about,
whether
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
the
trust
--
and
the
trust
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
its
--
it's
a
way
of
charging
the
facts
too.
they
charge
that
it
was
there.
now,
i
can
understand
that
if
it
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
on
that
basis,
that
you
could
raise
your
question
of
diversity.
but
if
it
does
state
a
cause
of
action,
why
would
that
not
be
enough.
if
it
states
a
cause
of
action
as
to
their
being
a
trustee,
i
don't
think
it's
maleficio,
then
--
assuming
that's
the
fact,
would
there
have
to
be
diversity
among
other
interveners?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
there
would
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
assuming
that
there
is,
assuming
they
are
right
in
charging
that
there
is.
what
would
happen
to
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
so
read
the
complaint
both
as
to
the
allegations
in
the
trial,
maybe
i'm
wrong
with
that.
that's
the
only
--
their
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
us
assume
that's
correct.
what
would
you
say
then
because
i
--
i
look
at
it
further,
i
just
want
--
assuming
they
are,
do
you
still
say
that
your
position
would
be
well
taken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
--
you'd
--
you'd
say,
then
it
doesn't
state
a
cause
of
action
on
that
phase
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
phase
of
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
phase
of
the
case
there,
were
they
charged
that
there's
a
--
there
been
this
fraud
--
perpetrated
that
that
made
them,
created
to
impress
the
trust
on
the
fund
that
he
had
gotten
and
on
the
stock
that
he
had
gotten
and
that
--
then
they
ask
for
a
prayer
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
if
that
is
well-charged,
then
states
a
cause
of
action.
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is,
because
i'm
not
(inaudible)
would
you
still
say
that
your
position
is
well
taken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
you're
still
--
you
are
saying
again
that
there
could
have
been
no
trust
fund,
there
aren't
ex
maleficio
created.
justice
hugo
l.
black
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
your
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
that
they
obtained
in
the
end
enough
money
or
--
or
--
show
the
money
they've
received
from
him
through
the
cause
will
be
an
evidence
that
they
own
them,
would
that
create
--
make
a
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
you
have
not
raised
the
question
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
try
this
case
if
it
were
real,
genuine
trust
fund
which
was
to
be
administered
by
the
court
and
divided
up
among
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
if
i'm
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
not
well
used,
i'm
talking
about
the,
how
to
try
it
by
reason
of
diversity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
what
i
meant
to
ask
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
way.
