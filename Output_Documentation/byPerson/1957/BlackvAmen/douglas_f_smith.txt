mr.
douglas
f.
smith
may
it
please
the
court.
my
distinguished
brother
has
made
some
reference
to
an
earlier
participation
of
mine
in
this
case.
i
think
he
somewhat
overemphasizes
the
significance
of
--
add
harmony
on
--
in
that
respect.
he
does
it
very
pleasantly
but
i
think
it
reflects
somewhat
of
an
overappraisal
of
the
importance
of
that
matter.
we
--
we'll
refer
to
that
a
little
later
on
if
our
time
permits,
and
i
think
it
will.
i
want
to
digress
from
the
ordered
plan
of
my
argument
to
say
this
at
the
very
outset.
if
my
distinguished
opponent
has
said
once,
he
said
20
times
that
here,
you
have
no
fund.
i
don't
want
to
catapult
myself
into
a
discussion
of
this
case
on
the
merits
before
i've
led
up
to
it.
but
i
just
want
to
say
this
about
that
contention
that
here
there's
no
fund,
which
is
the
critical
thing
apparently
in
petitioner's
mind.
in
every
single
case
in
which
this
court
has
exercised
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
non-diverse
interveners
in
order
to
finally
permit
a
court
to
dispose
a
property
or
money
or
a
fund
of
which
it's
taken
control.
there
isn't
a
single
one
of
those
cases
in
which
there's
any
money
locked
up
in
the
clerk's
drawer
or
in
the
registry
of
the
court.
every
single
case
is
a
case
in
which
a
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
of
some
fund
by
virtue
of
having
service
upon
the
defendant
and
has
impressed
an
equitable
trust
upon
that
money
and
that's
precisely
what
the
court
did
here
with
reference
to
black's
unjust
enrichment.
i
--
i
want
to
go
on
and
develop
this
case
if
i
may
in
an
orderly
way.
the
court
was
persuaded
to
grant
certiorari
here.
we
say
it
with
great
deference
and
humility
to
decide
a
question
which
is
not
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
certiorari
was
granted
upon
the
representation
of
the
petitioners
here
that
respondent's
claims
are
related
solely
in
the
sense
that
they
involve
some
common
questions
of
law
and
fact.
the
question
stated
by
you
for
decision
simply
assumed
the
correctness
of
that
assumption,
copied
it
out
of
their
petition
and
set
that
down
as
the
question.
that
question
is
not
here
before
this
court
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
claims
of
the
numerous
parties
here
are
not
separate
and
distinct,
they're
interdependent
claims
to
property
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
impressed
a
constructive
trust.
the
claim
of
each
party
here
is
for
a
proportionate
share
of
the
distribution
of
the
1947
sale
which
came
into
black's
hands
as
unjust
enrichment
and
upon
which
the
court
impressed
a
constructive
trust.
the
claims
are
interdependent
by
their
very
nature
inherently
and
my
friend
on
the
other
side
is
compelled
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
conceive
that
if
they
are
interdependent,
then
the
court
has
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
non-diverse
interveners.
now,
i'm
going
to
show
in
the
reply
brief
when
they
finally
face
the
facts
that
they
have
admitted
the
interdependence
of
these
claims.
now,
a
second
question
before
the
court
and
i
shall
undertake
later
to
show
that
this
is
a
substantial
question,
is
whether
or
not
quite
apart
from
the
diversity
of
citizenship
or
any
question
about
that,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
because
of
the
existence
here
of
a
federal
question.
the
complaint
alleged,
they
say
it
--
it's
an
afterthought.
the
complaint
alleged
that
black's
fraud
here
constituted
not
only
a
violation
of
the
common
law
but
that
it
constituted
a
violation
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
and
thus,
made
unlawful
and
forbad
the
gross
fraud
committed
by
william
black
in
this
case.
now,
if
you
please,
to
know
whether
these
claims
are
related
solely
in
the
sense
that
they
involve
some
common
questions
or
whether
their
interdependent
claims
and
to
know
whether
this
federal
cause
of
action
is
a
substantial
cause
of
action.
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
facts,
look
at
the
facts
as
to
how
the
case
arose,
how
black
treated
these
shares,
what
relief
is
sought
and
the
formula
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
determining
how
much
everybody
is
entitled
to
it.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
yes,
sir.
that's
substantially
it,
that
if
you
need
b
in
there
to
determine
what
his
share
is
in
this
common
unjust
enrichment,
then
they're
interdependent.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
where
you
got
a
fund
as
we
have
here
of
the
only
type
this
court
has
ever
dealt
with,
a
fund
that
consists
of
unjust
enrichment
upon
which
the
court
has
impressed
constructive
trust
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i'm
going
to
undertake
to
demonstrate
to
your
honor,
you
do
have
that
interdependence.
then
to
finally
adjudicate
the
question
and
dispose
of
the
fund
of
which
the
court
has
taken
jurisdiction,
you
need
to
know
what
these
interest
is.
that's
my
point.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
some
--
what,
please?
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
that's
true.
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
you
had
to
have
everybody
in
court
to
see
who
was
defrauded
and
for
how
much
in
order
to
--
to
distribute
and
allocate
this
fund
of
which
the
court
had
taken
jurisdiction.
that's
my
principle
factual
argument
that
i'm
going
to
get
to
a
little
later.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
they
couldn't
have
brought
separate
suits
to
participate
in
this
unjust
enrichment
on
which
the
court
impressed
a
constructive
trust
because
that
was
a
fund
of
which
the
court
took
jurisdiction.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
they
could
sue
black
on
some
theory,
possibly,
but
not
--
not
--
they
could
not
sue
black
on
our
theory
to
participate
in
this
unjust
enrichment
of
which
this
court
had
first
taken
jurisdiction.
most
of
these
cases
on
competition
between
courts,
your
honor,
depend
on
who
first
gets
jurisdiction
of
the
plaintiff
that
has
the
money
and
not
this
court.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
yes.
i
mean
the
fund
exactly
in
the
sense
that
existed
in
stewart
versus
dunham
where
the
fund,
as
mr.
acheson
would
call
it,
was
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
fraudulent
transferee.
it
wasn't
in
the
registry
of
the
court,
the
court
took
--
took
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
fraudulent
transferee
and
that
was
the
fund,
and
that's
the
fund
that
my
friends
have
got
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
you
honor,
let
me
say
this
to
the
justice.
there
isn't
a
case
in
the
books
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
which
this
court
or
if
you
please,
any
court
to
my
knowledge,
has
distinguished
between
these
two
things.
one,
money
locked
up
in
the
registry
of
the
court
or
in
the
clerk's
desk
and
two,
money
in
possession
of
the
defendant
on
which
the
court
has
impressed
a
constructive
trust.
i
can't
find
any
difference
between
those
two
things.
this
is
the
latter
situation
and
that's
the
situation
that
existed
in
substantially
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
exercised
ancillary
jurisdiction.
now,
i
want
to
give
you
the
facts
of
this
case
because
after
all,
i
take
it,
this
turns
on
the
facts.
many
of
the
parties
here
live
in
and
around
the
aledo,
a
farming
community
in
illinois.
william
black
in
1938
came
into
this
community.
he
was
an
oil
explorer,
driller,
he
wanted
to
get
money
to
finance
some
drilling
in
illinois.
he
establish
connections
in
aledo,
illinois
with
a
lawyer
there
of
wide
acquaintance.
and
working
together,
they
induced
a
large
number
of
the
people
in
that
little
farming
area
to
put
up
money
for
his
oil
explorations.
he
immediately
won
their
trust
and
confidence.
he
is
that
kind
of
an
operator.
the
first
agreement
that
they
made
between
them
to
show
that
fiduciary
relationship
is
that
in
this
agreement,
black
was
authorized
to
transact
all
business
of
every
kind
and
nature
under
and
in
connection
with
said
agreement
without
interference
from
any
parties
of
the
second
part.
well,
he
didn't
find
oil
in
illinois
and
so
he
moved
to
kansas.
and
again,
this
group
of
aledo
people
advanced
in
excess
of
all
he
used
in
the
purchase
and
leasing
and
development
of
our
properties
in
the
state
of
kansas.
a
corporation
was
formed
and
they
were
allotted
shares
in
proportion
to
their
advances.
that
was
a
corporation
just
informed.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
states
for
all
practical
purposes.
now,
i'm
quoting,
“black
was
the
corporation.
he
did
with
it
as
he
saw
fit
and
the
stockholders
followed
him
with
almost
blind
loyalty.
in
kansas,
black
struck
oil
fairly
prolifically.
in
1944
when
the
properties
began
to
increase
in
value,
he
formulated
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
a
--
and
i'm
quoting.
"a
definite
plan
to
eliminate
the
large
family
of
stockholders
including
the
aledo
group
and
to
acquire
the
stock
or
a
majority
of
it
in
the
effectuation
of
that
plan.”
our
respondent's
faith
and
confidence
in
black
was
such
that
he
didn't
need
to
indulge
in
any
particular
subtleties
in
order
to
get
this
stock
away
from
them.
he
just
told
them
or
had
them
told
that
the
company
had
been
sold,
if
you
please,
and
that
their
share
amounted
to
about
$11
per
share.h
he
told
them
they
must
just
turn
in
their
stock
a
half
of
it
in
1944
and
the
other
half
in
1945
and
they
did
so.
now,
the
shares
that
were
thus
personally
acquired
were
paid
for
by
back
out
of
company
funds
that
he
just
made
in
advance
to
himself
for
that
purpose.
he
took
a
block
of
it
in
his
own
name,
just
put
in
his
own
name.
at
the
bulk
of
it,
he
just
simply
retired.
well,
since
at
the
time
of
liquidation
he
owned
practically
all
the
stock,
put
in
it
--
retire
and
it
had
just
the
same
effects
substantially
as
that
that
he
took
in
his
own
name
as
if
he'd
taken
it
all
in
his
own
name.
now,
black's
second
major
fraud
was
the
secret
issuance
to
himself.
he
was
the
corporation
as
the
court
of
appeal
said.
he
just
issued
to
himself
32,000
shares
as
a
secret
property.
the
court
of
appeals
says
about
that,
“it's
clear
beyond
doubt
that
it
was
issued
surreptitiously,
covertly,
and
we
say
fraudulently
to
black."
i
--
actually,
the
company
hadn't
been
sold
at
all
in
1944
but
in
1947
when
he
had
succeeded
in
his
plan
of
eliminating
what
was
pleasantly
called
the
family
of
stockholders,
where
then
he
sold
to
ncra
for
a
price
of
$4.5
million.
now
we've
designated
for
printing
black's
entire
record
or
testimony
on
cross-examination.
i
committed
to
your
attention
because
it
shows
the
particular
way
in
which
it
--
he
handled
these
shares
that
make
these
claims
interdependent,
claims
to
this
fund
upon
which
the
court
impressed
a
constructive
trust.
it
also
shows
that
we've
got
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute
here.
incidentally,
it
shows
through
black's
own
list,
a
fraud
as
callous
and
cruel
as
was
ever
committed
by
a
fiduciary
against
people
who
trusted
him.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
sale
of
this
stock,
this
company,
black
owned
the
predominant
majority
of
the
stock.
his
stock
consisted
of
three
increments,
the
32,000
shares
that
he
stole.
it
consisted
of
the
shares
that
he
got
from
these
respondents
that
he
just
put
in
his
own
name.
it
consisted
of
a
block
of
shares
that
he
legally
owned.
now,
all
of
those
shares
are
the
participation
of
all
of
those
shares
was
of
course
very
greatly
increased
in
the
participation
of
the
--
in
the
sale.
their
share
was
very
greatly
increased
by
the
fraudulent
acquisition
and
the
arbiter
retirement
of
these
thousands
of
shares
of
the
respondents
nationally.
the
result
was
that
black
took
about
$3.5
million
out
of
the
$4.5
million
purchase
price.
now,
on
those
facts,
i
want
to
deal
first
with
the
federal
question
because
it
isn't
necessary
to
say
much
about
it
and
i
can
get
that
out
of
the
way.
we
say,
if
you
please,
that
without
regard
whatsoever
to
the
existence
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
there's
a
federal
question
here
that
gives
the
federal
court
jurisdiction.
in
that,
the
complaint
alleged
a
federal
statutory
cause
of
action.
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
in
conjunction
with
rule
x-10b-5
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
which
that
act
requires
to
be
made,
make
unlawful
acts
which
constitute
fraud
or
deceit
in
the
purchase
of
securities
and
thus,
make
unlawful,
the
gross
fraud
committed
by
black
in
this
case.
specifically,
it's
made
unlawful
by
the
act
and
the
rule
by
means
of
the
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
which
were
used
here.
i
quote,
“to
engage
in
any
act,
practice,
or
course
of
business
which
operates
or
would
operate
as
a
fraud
or
deceit
upon
any
person
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.”
now,
i
say
to
you
that
within
the
rule
cited
or
quoted
or
laid
down,
i
should
say
by
this
court
in
hurn
versus
oursler.
what
we
have
here
is
a
single
cause
of
action
for
fraud
supported
on
two
grounds,
a
common
law
ground
and
a
federal
ground.
we
charge
fraud
and
we
prove
fraud.
here,
far
from
this
question,
they
--
they
attempt
to
--
i
think
if
they
say
it's
a
happenstance
or
an
afterthought,
it'll
go
away.
but
here,
far
from
the
federal
question
being
insubstantial,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
may
fairly
be
read
to
sustain
the
cause
of
action
on
the
federal
ground
as
well
as
on
the
state
ground.
it's
a
determination
of
fraud
committed
by
black
and
that
satisfies
both
the
state
and
the
federal.
of
course
such
a
construction
of
the
opinion
isn't
at
all
necessary
under
the
rule
of
this
court
to
sustain
the
existence
of
a
federal
question
and
to
sustain
the
existence
of
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
for
that
reason.
the
rule
of
the
court
stated
in
the
syler
case
is
that
if
the
federal
question
is
substantial,
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
even
if
the
court
omits
to
pass
upon
the
federal
question
or
even
if
it
rules
adversely
upon
it.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
while
the
merits
of
this
federal
claim
are
of
course
not
before
this
court,
we
think
that
if
--
far
from
being
insubstantial,
whether
that
question
were
here,
this
court
would
certainly
hold
that
black's
gross
fraud
is
not
beyond
the
reach
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
and
rule
x-10b-5.
and
so,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
position
that
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction
here
because
of
the
existence
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
is
invulnerable
and
we
think
it's
more
invulnerable
or
we
think
that
there's
great
evidence
of
its
invulnerability
from
the
manner
in
which
they
attempt
to
deal
with
it.
they
say
in
their
brief,
and
my
distinguished
friend
has
said
here,
citing
niles
versus
beeman
(ph),
the
contention
is
an
afterthought.
that's
a
fragment
of
this
sentence
in
which
that
language
appears.
the
sentence
is
this;
“the
contention
is
an
afterthought
and
plainly
was
not
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
of
the
bill
of
complaint.
that's
what
this
court
hold.
here
in
paragraphs
8f,
and
i
want
to
be
explicit.
in
paragraphs
8f
and
19
of
the
complaint,
we
explicitly
alleged
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
quoted
almost
the
entire
text
of
rule
x-10b-5.
the
evidence,
if
you
please,
proved
equally.
we
weren't
talking
--
of
course
neither
side
was
talking
about
what
kind
of
fraud
this
is,
we
were
talking
about
whether
we're
--
whether
there
was
fraud.
but
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
establishes
equally
a
violation
of
the
federal
claim
and
a
violation
of
the
state
claim
and
it
would
require
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well,
the
reason
you
don't
find
it,
sir,
is
because
the
complaint
was
amended
and
there
was
a
lot
that
was
just
shorthand
in
the
report
but
i'll
read
--
that
have
to
be
appearing
on
page
15.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
to
employ
devices
schemes
and
artifices
to
defraud
and
then
follows
the
verbatim
statement
of
rule
x-10b-5,
another
rule
of
the
complaint
if
you
please.
19
--
i
mean,
another
paragraph
of
complaint.
having
specifically
alleged
a
violation
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
under
which
this
rule
is
promulgated.
i
say
if
you
please
that
if
--
it
would
require
a
change
in
the
subtle
line
of
decisions
on
this
--
this
court
with
reference
to
a
federal
question
to
say
that
this
--
this
did
not
present
a
substantial
federal
question.
now,
i
want
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
other
great
point
in
this
case
whether
these
claims
are
interdependent
claims
to
property
in
the
control
of
the
court
or
whether
they're
related
solely
in
the
sense
that
they
present
some
common
questions
of
law
and
fact.
before
doing
that,
i'd
like
to
spend
a
moment
on
stating
the
class
suits
that
were
brought,
the
type
of
relief
asked
and
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
two
identical
class
actions
were
brought
in
the
state
of
kansas,
mark
the
fact
please
that
one
was
brought
in
the
state
court
and
the
other
in
the
federal
court.
the
petitioner
here
who
is
so
concerned
and
so
solicitous
of
the
burden
imposed
upon
federal
courts
by
diversity
jurisdiction
in
general.
it
was
the
petitioner
who
removed
the
state
case
to
the
federal
court
asserting
federal
jurisdiction.
although
they
presently
have
a
great
deal
to
say
in
favor
of
a
state
determination
to
this
question
naturally,
they
wanted
a
federal
determination
until
they
got
it.
and
secondly,
as
to
diversity,
there's
no
genuine
question
here
as
to
the
diversity
of
citizenship
with
these
parties.
when
a
party
testifies,
i
submit
that
he's
been
farming
in
the
state
of
illinois
for
40
years
or
living
in
aledo
for
27
years
and
that
was
the
type
of
testimony
offered
here.
it
approaches
the
frivolous
to
try
to
raise
questions
about
citizenship
but
they
were
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
they'd
want
an
elucidation
of
whether
residents
in
illinois
as
a
farmer
for
40
years
means
that
he's
living
there,
they
were
there
and
had
their
full
opportunity
to
inquire.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
petitioners
no
to
an
absolute
certainty
that
there
are
only
two
non-diverse
people
in
this
case
and
that's
mr.
and
mrs.
constant.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
the
record
shows
the
substantial
fact
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
yes.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
and
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
observation
that
the
court
made
that
made
me
to
ought
to
go
back
to
the
left,
the
court
really
find
out.
i
say
that
in
view
of
this
issue
about
citizenship,
it
was
raised.
when
this
man
goes
on
and
says,
“well,
i
live
in
illinois.
i've
been
farming
there
for
40
years.”
if
somebody
thinks
that
means
that
he
isn't
a
citizen,
there's
some
nuance
between
citizenship
and
residence.
there
was
the
chance
to
find
out
about
it.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
i
knew
that,
your
honor.
now,
when
black
consummated
his
fraud,
he
moved
to
california.
two
of
his
victims,
mr.
and
mrs.
constant
are
also
now
residents
of
california.
they
lived
in
aledo
and
have
citizenship
there,
if
you
please,
when
this
fraud
was
committed.
mrs.
constant
was
a
doctor's
assistant
there.
her
husband
was
in
the
navy.
when
he
got
out
of
the
navy,
they
moved
to
california,
which
is
black's
residence.
they're
the
only
two
non-diverse
individuals
in
this
case.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
yes,
sir,
it
does.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
no,
they
didn't.
they
didn't
make
any
allegations
as
i
recall
it.
now,
i'm
a
little
bit
hazy
about
that,
i
recall
it
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
because
they
made
mr.
seder
advise
me,
they
did
make
some
allegations
on
citizenship.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
oh,
yes.
yes,
it
would.
it
would
take
care
--
it's
on
page
39,
if
the
justice
please.
now,
i
want
to
come
to
the
merits
with
this
statement.
as
i
said
very
unconnectedly
in
the
first
instance,
i
think,
the
reason
for
the
federal
court's
historic
exercise
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
non-diverse
interveners.
in
certain
types
of
cases
is
--
has
been
made
very
clear
by
this
court.
when
the
court
has
in
its
control
for
disposition,
property
or
money
as
to
which
there
are
a
number
of
plaintiffs,
full
equity
and
justice
make
it
necessary
to
let
those
people
come
into
court
to
present
their
claims
and
to
share
in
the
participation
of
the
property
subject
to
the
disposition
of
the
court.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
now
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well,
you're
asking
me
about
res
judicata
of
course,
and
i
think
they'd
be
bound
in
this
respect.
i
think
they
couldn't
win
to
another
court
and
undertake
to
get
paid
out
of
the
unjust
enrichment
upon
which
this
court
impressed
a
constructive
trust
and
i
think
what
would
happen
in
this
case
and
should
happen
in
this
case
is
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court
with
a
mandate
to
serve
notice
and
let
anybody
come
in
who
hasn't
come
in
and
prove
up
and
participate
in
the
distribution
of
this
fund
of
which
the
court
has
taken
control.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
he
couldn't
get
a
judgment
for
fraud.
that
--
that
raises
the
question
of
due
--
res
judicata
in
the
dickinson
case
that
i
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
to
refer
to.
judge
clark,
former
dean
clark,
said
that
he
--
he
wasn't
going
to
anticipate
res
judicata
questions.
i
think
that
if
this
case
proceeds
as
i
hope
it
will
that
finally,
everybody
will
have
to
come
in
and
be
permitted
to
come
in
and
certainly,
it'll
be
res
judicata
as
to
the
fellow
that
comes
in.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
and
that's
as
far
as
i
--
now,
i
have
attempted
to
state
the
rule
that
underlies
the
exercise
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
by
this
court,
where
the
courts
got
property
in
an
order
distributed
and
each
to
know
whom
it
belongs
to.
now,
the
petitioners
concede
this.
on
page
22
of
the
brief,
i
don't
mean
to
herald
that
as
a
big
concession,
they're
conceding
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
rule.
but
on
page
22
of
their
brief
referring
to
stewart
versus
dunham
on
which
we
strongly
rely,
and
your
honor,
you
won't
find
any
difference
between
the
so-called
fund
that
existed
there
and
the
fund
we've
got
here
because
the
court
have
jurisdiction
to
the
defendant.
referring
to
the
dunham
case,
they
say
this
on
page
22.
in
this
type
of
action
as
emphasized
in
stewart
versus
dunham,
all
members
of
the
class
having
claims
regardless
of
their
citizenship
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
decree
adjudicating
rights
in
the
fund
or
other
property
under
the
court's
control.
not
in
the
registry
of
the
court,
but
under
the
court's
control.
on
the
next
page,
however,
it
occur
that
the
action
here,
and
i'm
quoting
again,
“presents
only
a
series
of
separate
and
distinct
claims.”
now,
mark
this,
“related
solely
in
the
sense
that
there's
a
common
question
of
law
or
fact
involved
in
the
common
relief
as
sought.”
i'm
going
to
show
that
they've
had
to
concede
in
the
reply
briefs
that
that
just
isn't
so.
that's
the
issue
between
us.
now,
the
theory
of
these
class
actions
which
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
is
this,
that
these
people
that
were
defrauded
of
their
stock
continued
to
be
the
equitable
owners
of
that
stock
until
the
time
of
the
sale.
and
that
upon
the
sale,
equity
impressed
a
constructive
trust
upon
that
portion
of
the
purchased
price
that
came
into
black's
hands
for
the
interest
represented
by
those
shares
equitably
held
by
these
people.
and
he
denominated
black
a
trustee
ex
maleficio
to
account
for
that
unjust
enrichment.
the
court
recognized
first
that
the
rights
being
vindicated
was
a
common
right
to
participate
in
that
unjust
enrichment.
the
court
said
this,
three
--
two
or
three
sentences.
“in
equity,
the
stockholders
remain
the
owners
of
their
shares
with
the
right
to
participate
in
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
in
the
proportion
that
their
stock
ownership
there
as
to
the
total
stock
entitled
to
participate
in
the
assets
of
the
company
at
the
time
of
sale.”
i'm
still
quoting.
“in
these
circumstances,
equity
will
impress
a
trust
upon
the
stock
and
constitute
black
a
trustee
for
the
profits
he
reaped
from
the
date
he
received
it
until
he
finally
sold
it
or
retired.”
now,
here's
the
reason
these
claims
are
interdependent.
the
fact
is
that
no
one
having
a
claim
here
that
his
shares
were
fraudulently
acquired
and
arbitrarily
retired.
no
such
person
has
a
claim
for
any
fixed
absolute
or
pre-determinable
amount.
all
he
has
is
a
claim
that
he
was
deprived
of
a
common
right
to
participate
in
the
proceeds
of
the
1947
sale.
the
claim
and
the
recovery
on
each
of
these
claims
of
the
defrauded
stockholders
necessarily
depended
therefore
on
the
total
number
of
shares
that
were
fraudulently
acquired,
and
entitled
to
be
equitably
outstanding.
and
that
obviously
depended
in
turn
upon
the
determination
of
the
total
number
of
shares
that
were
entitled
to
participate
on
the
ground
that
their
--
of
the
owners
that
their
shares
were
fraudulently
acquired
and
arbitrarily
retired.
and
so,
the
claims
are
inherently
interdependent.
now,
i
want
to
sharply
contrast
the
explicit
representation
--
i
don't
mean
to
use
that
in
an
unpleasant
sense,
the
--
the
assertion
of
my
friend
on
the
other
side
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
i
want
to
contrast
that
with
fact.
petitioner
told
this
court,
“your
plaintiffs
are
to
be
paid
in
full.
your
recovery
is
based
on
an
ordinary
tort
liability
for
defrauding.”
i
want
to
contrast
that
with
the
court
of
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
“recovery
is
predicated
upon
the
equitable
principle
of
unjust
enrichment,
not
the
theory
of
provable
damages.”
well
then,
mr.
acheson
goes
on.
“your
recovery
is
based
on
an
ordinary
tort
liability
for
defrauding
under”
--
and
i'm
quoting,
“a
formula
resulting
in
the
same
fixed,
absolute
amount
of
each
claimant
regardless
of
the
number
of
claimants.”
i'm
going
to
show
that
he
has
admitted
that
that
isn't
true
in
his
reply
brief.
now,
let's
see
whether
the
--
under
this
court
of
appeals
formula,
the
setup
for
the
district
court.
the
claims
is
represented
by
petitioners
“are
to
be
paid
in
full,”
as
counsel
says.
under
a
formula
which
produces
the
same
fixed
absolute
amount,
each
claimant
regardless
the
number
of
claim.
or
whether
under
the
prescribed,
formula
they're
actually
practically,
factually
interdependent.
this
formula
provides
first
that
only
validly
issued
shares
may
participate.
what
follows
is
the
critical
part
of
the
formula
that
they
just
ignored
in
their
petition
for
certiorari.
the
court
says,
“validly
issued
shares
involved
in
the
1947
sale
must
include
any
arbitrarily
retired”
--
i
underscore
that
language
--
“arbitrarily
retired
by
black
prior
to
set
sale
and
of
course
must
exclude
the
stock
fictitiously
issued.”
“arbitrarily
retired,”
they
are
the
keywords
in
this
formula.
to
determine
which
shares
were
arbitrarily
retired
and
entitled
to
participate
in
the
proceeds
is
necessary
to
determine
on
the
evidence,
if
you
please,
what
shares
were
fraudulently
acquired,
who
was
defrauded,
and
for
how
much.
it's
necessary
to
do
that
as
they
now
concede
in
order
to
determine
the
recovery
on
every
other
claim
against
this
property
in
the
control
of
the
court.
our
chart
on
page
27
of
the
brief
shows
the
interdependence
of
these
claims
under
the
court's
formula.
due
to
the
fact,
if
you
please,
that
the
number
of
shares
outstanding,
the
number
of
validly
issued
shares
which
include
only
those
who
were
fraudulently
acquired,
the
number
of
shares
outstanding
is
a
variable
depending
upon
the
determination
of
the
merits
of
every
other
claim
to
that
fund
of
which
the
court
has
taken
control.
as
shown
in
column
two,
if
amen
shares
the
loan,
had
established
the
basis
for
recovery,
the
outturn
to
him
would
have
been
$81
per
share.
taking
the
--
another
--
the
other
extreme
shown
in
column
two
on
that
chart,
“if
everybody
before
the
distinct
court
who
made
a
claim
had
been
shown
to
be
entitled
to
recover,
the
amount
would
have
been
$48.66.
they
all
weren't
permitted
to
recover.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
lot
of
them
were
not
by
the
district
court
or
he
didn't'
make
findings
that
they've
been
deprived
of
their
shares
to
a
fraud
and
they
appealed.
and
as
to
some
that
appealed,
the
court
said
there
that
--
as
to
those
few
that
they
were
defrauded,
they
were
entitled
to
participate
and
what
practical
effect
did
that
had?
that
enlarged
the
divisor,
it
reduced
the
per
share
out
turn
for
every
individual
in
the
case.
now,
that's
what
i
call
here
interdependence
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
type
of
case
which
requires
a
court
to
take
ancillary
jurisdiction
if
he's
disposed
of
the
whole
fund.
that
wide
variation
shows
the
degree
of
interdependence.
now,
i
want
to
summarize
by
saying
this.
there
isn't
just
one
element
of
interdependence
here.
there
are
three
factors
that
make
these
claims
interdependent.
the
amount
of
recovery
on
each
individual
claim
depends
on
a
determination
of
the
merits
of
every
other
claim.
that's
one.
the
second
is
that
all
illegally
and
equitably
outstanding
shares
here
have
a
common
right
to
participate
in
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
that
went
to
that
fictitious
32,000
shares
that
black
issued
secretly
and
fraudulent
to
himself.
now,
there's
the
third
type
of
interdependency.
some
of
black's
business
cronies
were
permitted
to
stay
in
this
thing
until
the
sale,
and
to
participate
in
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
their
participation,
of
course
like
black's,
was
very
greatly
increased
by
the
arbitrary
retirement
of
the
shares
of
the
aledo
group.
that
didn't
go
to
swell
black's
unjust
enrichment,
it
went
to
those
individuals.
and
the
result
of
it
is
that
black's
unjust
enrichment
which
is
the
property,
the
fund,
upon
which
this
court
has
issued
levy
to
constructive
trust.
it's
less
than
the
total
loss
of
the
respondents.
and
the
result
is,
because
of
that
discrepancy
that
--
if
every
claim
here
must
be
pro
rata
adjusted
because
the
unjust
enrichment
is
less
than
the
total
loss,
so
to
those
three
types
of
interdependency.
now,
in
his
reply
brief,
for
the
first
time,
prior
to
that
time,
mr.
acheson
has
relied
upon
what
somebody
said
in
the
early
stages
this
case
below
or
on
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
--
he
comes
to
grips
for
the
first
time
in
his
reply
brief
with
the
facts
that
determined
whether
there
is
truly
interdependence
or
where
there's
not.
now,
we
submit
that
on
pages
17
to
21
of
his
reply
brief
--
i
like
to
underscore
that.
17
to
21
of
his
reply
brief.
he
shows
that
he
finds
it
impossible
to
turn
to
the
facts
and
to
discuss
the
facts
without
conceding
that
there
is
indeed
interdependence
as
between
these
claims
to
the
fund
upon
which
the
court
impressed
a
constructive
trust.
petitioner
there
acknowledges,
as
i'm
going
to
point
out
to
you,
as
our
chart
demonstrates,
that
the
recovery
on
every
claim
here
depends
in
literal
fact
upon
a
determination
of
the
merits
of
every
other
claim
of
every
other
person
seeking
a
right
to
participate.
brought
face-to-face
for
the
first
time
with
the
court
of
appeals
formula
which
they
had
ignored
in
the
three
brief
previously
filed.
brought
face-to-face
with
it,
the
statement
in
the
formula
that
only
validly
issued
shares
can
participate
and
that
it
must
be
determined
by
the
evidence
as
to
each
share
whether
it
was
fraudulently
obtained
and
arbitrarily
required
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
was
validly
--
existed.
face-to-face
with
that,
they're
brought
to
this
striking
confession.
i'm
going
to
put
together
a
few
sentence
to
this,
in
that
portion
of
their
brief.
the
total
number
of
validly
issued
shares
at
liquidation
is
a
fact
to
be
determined.
in
determining
the
fact
from
the
proof,
a
court
must
decide
the
number
of
validly
issued
shares
at
the
time
of
liquidation,
facts
that
go
beyond
an
individual
plaintiff's
interest
must
be
considered
in
working
of
the
amount
of
recovery.
here,
the
amount
per
share
to
which
he's
entitled.
there's
five-minute
period
or
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
i'll
note
that
to
address
my
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
i'll
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
may
it
please
the
court.
to
recapitulate
for
just
a
moment,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
that
in
our
view,
the
question
here
is
essentially
one
of
fact
not
of
law.
we
say
that
on
the
facts
here,
the
question
posed
by
the
court
on
certiorari
is
not
presented,
it's
not
presented
by
the
facts.
petitioner
cites
a
number
of
decisions
by
distinguished
courts
and
judges
which
hold
as
--
he
stated
in
one
quite
graphically
that
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
non-diverse
interveners
in
a
case
in
which
the
claims
are
simply
a
conjury
of
separate
claims
involving
only
common
questions.
we
don't
find
it
necessary
to
deal
with
those
cases.
they
do
not
relate
to
the
facts
of
the
case
before
the
court.
they're
germane
to
the
argument
that
brother
acheson
has
with
professor
moore
which
is
an
interesting
question
but
it's
an
academic
one
in
this
case.
on
the
other
hand,
we
rely
on
many
cases
in
which
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
have
held
that
if
the
claims
are
interdependent
claims
to
funds
of
which
the
federal
court
has
taken
control,
that
then
jurisdiction
exists
to
make
a
full
disposition
of
that
property
subject
to
the
control
of
the
court.
petitioner
purports
not
to
question
these
decisions
naturally.
he
says
yes
but
in
those
cases,
there
were
--
there
were
really
funds
there.
well,
let's
see
about
that.
in
the
leading
case
of
stewart
versus
dunham,
decision
of
this
court,
there
was
an
equitable
trust
imposed
upon
money
in
the
hands
of
the
fraudulent
transferee.
it
wasn't
locked
in
the
court's
safe
or
in
the
physical
possession
of
the
court.
it
was
--
it
was
just
money
in
the
hands
of
the
fraudulent
transferee.
let's
look
at
hanley
versus
(inaudible).
there,
there
wasn't
any
money
in
possession
of
the
court
in
the
literal
sense.
it
was
money
in
the
hands
of
stockholders
who
hadn't
paid
for
their
stock
subscriptions
and
the
creditor
is
one
to
get
to
him.
and
the
court
impressed
a
constructive
trust
on
it
and
then
heard
the
property,
was
property
in
the
assets
of
an
insurance
company.
and
in
dickinson
versus
burnham,
there
is
a
case
that's
particularly
an
uncomfortable
one
from
my
friend.
it
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
fairly
recently.
there,
there
had
been
money
collected
for
a
corporate
purpose.
but
as
the
district
court
said
in
that
case,
the
case
was
not
one
to
collect
from
a
trustee
of
that
money
that
had
been
collected,
the
trustee
wasn't
in
court.
it
was
not
a
case
to
reinstate
a
trust.
if
you
please,
it
was
precisely
the
situation
we
have
here,
the
court
impressed
a
constructive
trust
upon
unjust
enrichment
that
came
into
the
hands
of
a
fraud
feasor,
exactly
the
situation
we
have
here
and
the
court
said
that
there
were
independent
claims
in
an
order
fully
to
distribute
the
fund.
it
should
be
done
by
one
court.
and
he
took
--
he
took
jurisdiction
of
non-diverse
interveners
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
i
was
going
to
put
that
last
but
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
if
you
don't
mind,
i
--
i
will.
i'm
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
get
to
it.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
so,
they
can't
do
much
with
this
fund
distinction.
and
so
finally
and
belatedly
and
in
the
fourth
brief,
they
filed
in
this
court,
they
come
to
the
reality
of
dealing
with
the
facts.
and
i've
put
together
some
of
these
sentences
and
that's
where
i
left
off
when
the
court
rose
yesterday.
in
which
they
say,
the
total
number
of
validly
issued
shares
at
liquidation
is
a
fact
to
be
determined.
in
determining
the
fact
from
the
proof,
a
court
must
decide
the
number
of
validly
issued
shares
at
the
time
of
liquidation.
mark
this
please,
“facts
that
go
beyond
an
individual
plaintiff's
interests
must
be
considered
in
working
out
the
amount
of
recovery.
here,
the
amount
per
share
to
which
he
is
entitled.”
now,
i
earnestly
ask
the
court
to
compare
that
admission,
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
the
court's
got
to
know
how
much
everybody
else
is
entitled
to
with
this
statement
upon
which
they
--
by
which
they
induced
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
just
please
compare
what
i've
read
in
the
reply
brief
with
his
statement.
“the
court
of
appeals
formula,"
and
i'm
quoting,
"produces
the
same
fixed
absolute
amount
to
each
claimant
regardless
of
the
number
of
claimants.”
that's
the
--
that's
the
representation
upon
which
you
granted
certiorari.
now,
for
the
first
time
in
their
reply
brief,
they
come
to
face
with
the
reality,
namely
the
intensely
practical
fact
that
the
amount
that
every
person
gets
out
of
this
fund
on
which
the
courts
impressed
the
constructive
trust.
the
--
everybody's
claim
is
for
more
or
fewer
dollars
depending
upon
the
merits
of
the
claim
of
every
other
individual
who
stopped
was
arbitrarily
retired.
for
the
first
time,
they
have
conceded
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
actual,
factual
interdependence
here
makes
it
necessary
to
determine
on
the
evidence
as
to
each
of
these
claims
whether
the
individual
parted
with
his
stock
through
fraud
and
the
amount
of
his
claim.
they
concede
in
the
part
i've
read
to
the
court
that
they
--
you
have
to
do
that
in
order
to
determine
how
much
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to.
now,
let's
see
what
this
means
further.
it
means
that
after
the
court
has
determined
the
precise
amount
of
the
unjust
enrichment
and
determined
exactly
the
amount
that
all
the
victims
of
this
fraud
are
entitled
to.
that
then,
the
court
can't
distribute
that
unjust
enrichment
of
which
he's
taking
control,
but
he's
got
to
the
people
that
have
been
shown
by
this
evidence
that
they
say
is
necessary
to
be
entitled
to
it.
he
can't
distribute
this
fund
of
which
he's
taking
control.
but
he's
got
to
turn
back
to
the
trustee
ex
maleficio.
he's
got
to
turn
back
to
black.
that
part
of
this
fund
which
has
been
shown
to
be
due
to
the
non-diverse
interveners.
well
now,
in
this
case
for
example,
what
that
means
is
that
you've
got
to
determine
from
the
evidence
of
mr.
and
mrs.
constant
whether
they
parted
with
their
shares
through
fraud
and
how
much
they
are
entitled
to.
you've
got
to
do
that,
they
say,
in
order
to
determine
what
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to,
but
after
you
have
determined
what
the
constants
are
entitled
to,
then
they
say,
"the
court
must
turn
them
out
of
court
because
they're
non-diverse
and
it
can't
give
them
their
established
part
of
this
fund.
professor
(inaudible),
one
time,
characterized
the
type
of
cases
in
which
federal
courts
exercise
ancillary
jurisdiction
over
non-diverse
people.
i
say
in
that
non-diverse
people
are
permitted
to
come
in
order
to
dispose
of
the
property
of
which
the
court
has
taken
jurisdiction.
and
that
he
says
it's
like
dividing
up
a
pie.
he
says
you've
got
to
count
the
people
around
the
table.
you've
got
to
know
who's
there
before
you
cut
the
pie,
before
you
know
how
many
pieces
there
are.
well,
my
friend
on
the
other
side
goes
partway.
they
--
they
have
to
count
the
constants.
they
have
to
count
the
people.
they
have
to
find
out
about
it.
but
after
the
pie
has
been
cut,
then
the
constants
are
turned
away
from
the
table,
they
are
not
permitted
to
get
their
pieces
of
the
pie.
but
those
pieces
of
the
pie
are
turned
back
to
the
fraud
feasor
out
of
this
property
of
which
the
court
has
taken
jurisdiction.
now,
we
submit
that
what
this
contention
adds
up
to
is
a
brand
new
contention
in
this
lawsuit
that
federal
courts
just
don't
have
after
all
--
federal
courts
don't
have
the
jurisdiction
they
have
exercised
from
the
beginning
of
the
court
to
deal
with
non-diverse
interveners
in
order
to
adjudicate
interdependent
rights
to
property
on
which
the
court
has
impressed
a
constructive
trust.
the
petition
here
was
aimed
primarily
and
naturally
so
at
the
substantive
judgment
alone,
the
judgment
holding
black
guilty
of
fraud
and
require
him
account
for
his
unjust
enrichment.
but
the
court
denied
certiorari
on
the
merits
of
that
substantive
judgment
and
left
black
only
with
this
narrow
jurisdictional
point.
the
jurisdictional
point
is
so
self-limiting
that
black
has
found
that
an
extremely
poor
substitute
for
the
review
on
the
merits
which
he
sought.
the
jurisdictional
point
involving
the
constants
is
a
self-limiting
point
because
the
very
heart
of
the
contention
on
which
it
rest
is
that
the
claims
of
the
constants
are
wholly
separate
and
distinct
from
those
of
every
other
party.
so,
if
we
accept
completely
here
and
i
think
my
friend
on
the
other
side
conceded
this
in
a
question
from
justice
black
or
justice
douglas,
its
--
if
we
accept
fully
the
proposition
that
the
court's
question
was
correctly
posed
on
the
facts
which
we
say
it
was.
and
if
we
concede
arguendo
that
non-diverse
parties
should
not
be
permitted
in
this
case,
concede
everything
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
argue
under
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari
that
we
have
here.
what
we
come
to
is
the
proposition,
that
two
parties,
the
constants
were
non-diverse,
were
permitted
to
intervene
here
and
ought
to
be
dismissed
out
of
this
case
without
questions.
well
now,
that
would
be
most
unfortunate
for
the
constants.
we've
devoted
our
entire
defense
here
substantially
to
showing
that
it
would
be
an
unjust
and
improper
result.
but
at
the
same
time,
its
very
poor
comfort
for
mr.
black,
and
so
he
asks
an
opportunity
to
perform
a
very
delicate
operation
which
he
didn't
really
elaborate
here
in
argument
as
he
did
in
his
brief.
the
judgment
against
the
constants
would
--
the
dropping
out
of
the
constants
would
reduce
the
judgment
only
insignificant.
and
so
black
has
deemed
it
to
be
utterly
essential
to
find
some
basis
on
which
he
could
defeat
the
participation
of
the
other
plaintiffs
as
well
as
the
constants.
and
since
the
majority
of
the
other
parties
are
residents
of
illinois,
the
expedient
which
he
has
adopted
is
an
effort
to
destroy
the
diversity
of
the
illinois
people.
and
here's
where
the
delicate
operation
comes
in.
he
sees
as
his
vehicle
on
black
marshall
oil
corporation.
he
wants
the
black
marshall
oil
company
to
be
held
to
be
a
necessary
party
in
order
to
destroy
the
diversity
that
exist
between
the
bulk
of
the
plaintiffs
and
black
marshall.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
it
is
not
here
--
it
is
not
here.
somehow
however,
he
must
contend
that
black
marshall
is
a
necessary
party
and
must
be
aligned
as
a
defendant,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
dissolve
and
fully
liquidated
before
this
suit
was
brought,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
in
their
petition,
own
petition
for
removal,
they
said
it
wasn't
a
necessary
party.
it
seems
i
have
five
minutes.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well,
now
the
sufficient
reason
why
that
didn't
work
has
been
observed
by
justice
douglas.
the
court
did
not
take
jurisdiction
of
that
question,
did
not
grant
certiorari
as
to
that
question.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
equity
in
the
corporate
claim
because
the
money
would
go
to
n.c.r.a.,
the
purchaser
which
had
gotten
full
value
for
what
it
paid.
but
the
court
held
that
black
equity
would
not
permit
black
to
participate
in
the
proceeds
of
this
sale
in
respect
to
this
32,000
shares.
that
contention
was
vigorously
attacked
in
this
court
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
by
the
petitioner
asserting
that
the
wrong
resulted
not
to
the
stockholders
but
to
the
corporation.
the
court
denied
certiorari
on
that
issue,
not
withstanding
that
denial
and
limitation
on
certiorari
in
a
desperate
effort
to
defeat
the
participation
of
this
illinois
people.
they
simply
reargue
all
over
again
that
question
and
what
they
asked
is
a
remand
to
the
district
court
that
will
broad
enough
to
enable
them
to
argue
that
question
to
the
district
court,
and
thus,
achieve
the
same
result
as
if
they
have
gotten
a
certiorari
on
the
merits
which
was
denied,
and
then
gotten
the
substantive
judgment
set
aside.
now,
i
--
i
come
to
this
action
of
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
want
to
say
first
and
correct
a
misstatement
of
my
brother
acheson
on
the
opening,
in
which
he
said
twice
that
it
was
a
divided
court
that
reversed,
it
was
not.
it
was
a
unanimous
court
with
reference
to
the
basic
fraud
that
black
had
committed
wholly
and
that
he
must
account
for
his
unjust
enrichment.
one
judge
dissented
on
some
technical
grounds
with
reference
to
the
corporation
and
the
32,000
shares.
now,
to
avoid
coming
to
grips
with
the
facts,
as
the
interdependence
here,
they
relied
throughout
three
of
their
briefs
on
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
done
here.
they
rely
upon
the
circumstance
that
in
a
different
context
and
in
reply
to
a
different
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
these
questions
involved
this
claim,
this
suit
involves
common
questions
of
law
and
fact.
as
of
course
most
obviously
it
does,
and
that
it
does
met
the
requirements
of
spurious
class
action.
now,
let's
see,
if
you
please,
what
contention
the
court
was
responding
to
and
what
significance
that
has
if
any
in
relation
to
the
question
under
discussion
here.
petitioner's
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
exactly
the
opposite
of
their
position
here.they
said
there
that
these
claims
didn't
present
common
questions
of
law
and
fact.
they
didn't
present
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
because
they
said
that
the
fraud
had
been
separately
committed.
they
said
it
wasn't
a
spurious
class
action
and
for
that
reason
--
for
that
reason
because
it
wasn't
a
spurious
class
action,
the
court
couldn't
hear
non-diverse
interveners.
well,
they
--
they
made
their
assertion
that
these
claims
didn't
present
common
questions
of
law
and
fact,
mr.
justice,
on
the
theory
that
they
had
been
separately
committed
not
by
one
prospectus
or
at
one
meeting.
the
court
of
appeals
responding
to
that
held
that
the
fraudulent
representations
were
made
in
pursuance
of
a
definite
plan
to
eliminate
a
large
family
of
stockholders,
i'm
quoting,
“and
that
the
testimony
indisputably
shows
the
general
pattern
of
action.”
and
so,
he
said
that
the
claims
do
present
common
questions
of
law
and
fact.
now,
that
was
the
only
question
before
the
court
on
this
point.
it
had
no
occasion
whatever
to
find
out
or
to
say
whether
in
addition
to
presenting
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
which
of
course
they
do,
they
were
also
interdependent.
with
the
court's
formula,
you
will
find
when
you
study
it,
does
recognize
the
interdependence
of
the
claims
and
makes
provision
for
it.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
the
court
was
responding
--
you've
got
to
take
that
in
context,
mr.
justice.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
all
right,
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well,
i
--
i
think
maybe
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
--
that
becomes
necessary
when
--
when
a
petitioner
relies
not
on
the
facts
of
his
case
but
upon
what
somebody
has
said
about
it.
but
bear
mind,
if
you
please
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
just
a
matter
of
fairness
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
point
out
that
they
weren't
dealing
at
all
with
the
question
that's
presented
here.
they
heard
no
argument
on
it.
they
were
dealing
simply
with
a
question
as
to
whether
these
frauds
had
been
separately
committed
and
that's
all
they
were
dealing
with.
but
they
did
make
provision
for
the
interdependence
of
these
claims
in
the
formula
and
why
did
they
do
so?
simply
because,
mr.
justice,
they
couldn't
spell
out
the
mechanics
by
which
the
district
court
should
deal
with
these
claims
below
without
confronting
the
facts
of
interdependence
and
that's
the
thing
that
has
forced
these
people
when
they
come
to
deal
with
the
facts
to
admit
the
interdependence.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well,
your
honor,
my
recollection
of
that
answer
and
i
think
it's
accurate,
is
that
they
went
down
through
the
complaint
mostly
with
denials.
they
just
denied,
for
example,
existence
of
a
federal
question,
they
just
denied
this
and
denied
that
and
then
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
prayed
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
well,
no.
they
--
they
didn't.
they
just
--
they
just
answered
and
asked
judgment
for
the
defendants
which
we
normally
do.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
oh,
yes.
they
just
denied
the
fraud
and
asked
that
no
relief
be
granted.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
your
honor
there
was
--
there
was
--
mr.
douglas
f.
smith
it
was
not
assemblance
of
--
of
an
attack
made
on
that
theory,
not
at
all.
