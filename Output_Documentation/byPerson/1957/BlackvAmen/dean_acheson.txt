mr.
dean
acheson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
limited
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
that
court
reversed
on
a
divided
vote.
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
kansas,
which
after
trial,
dismissed
three
suits
which
have
been
heard
together.
the
principal
suit
was
brought
by
a
stockholder,
a
single
stockholder
in
a
corporation
of
illinois
known
as
the
black-marshall
oil
company.
it
was
brought
against
the
petitioner
here
who
was
the
president
of
that
corporation
and
the
manager
of
it.
the
jurisdiction
was
alleged
to
be
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
complaint
resounded
in
fraud.
it
alleged
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
been
induced
to
sell
stock
which
the
plaintiff
owned
in
the
black-marshall
oil
company
as
have
many
other
stockholders,
it
was
alleged,
by
reason
of
fraudulent
representations
for
which
the
defendant
was
said
to
be
responsible.
it
went
on
to
allege
that
less
was
paid
for
the
stock
than
its
value
at
the
time
of
the
sale
that
the
stock
was
held
until
four
or
five
years
later
when
there
was
a
sale
of
the
corporation
and
a
winding
up
of
its
affairs
at
which
time
the
stock
was
worth
more
than
it
had
been
at
the
time
of
the
sale
and
that
the
defendant
was
a
constructive
trustee.
it
alleged
further
that
the
defendant
had
acquired
stock
from
the
corporation
without
paying
adequate
consideration
so
that
his
share
in
the
division
of
the
assets
of
the
corporation
was
fraudulently
increased
by
that
amount
also.
there
was
a
second
suit,
which
was
brought
by
receivers
which
the
plaintiff
in
the
first
suit
had
had
appointed,
which
made
the
same
allegations
that
i've
just
recited
and
asked
for
a
recovery
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
for
the
amount
of
the
stock,
the
value
of
the
stock
in
liquidation
which
was
said
to
have
been
issued
without
consideration.
there
was
a
third
case
brought
by
other
stockholders
in
the
state
court
in
kansas
making
the
same
allegations.
now,
these
cases
were
brought
together.
all
the
parties
intervened
in
the
first
case
and
the
cases
were
tried
together
before
judge
hill
of
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
your
honor.
the
individual
stockholders
who
brought
suit
asked
that
they
be
considered
setting
the
trust
of
the
defendant
and
that
he
should
pay
them
the
value
of
their
stock.
mr.
dean
acheson
personally,
yes
sir,
each
one.
and
the
corporation
wanted
to
recover
from
the
defendant
the
value
of
the
stocks
supposed
to
have
been
issued
without
adequate
compensation.
judge
hill
had
a
long
file
and
found
on
the
merits
against
the
plaintiffs.
he
found
that
the
defendant
was
not
guilty
of
any
misrepresentation,
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
man
who
didn't
make
misrepresentations,
that
he
was
not
his
agent,
that
he
did
not
know
about
it,
that
he'd
pay
full
value
for
the
stock
and
the
--
both
from
the
plaintiffs
and
also
from
the
corporation,
and
the
judge
dismissed
all
the
cases.
there
was
then
an
appeal
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
over
the
dissent
of
one
of
the
judges,
reversed
the
district
court
on
the
facts.
it
found
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
in
that
court
of
--
of
the
respondent
in
that
court
guilty
of
fraud
and
allowed
the
individuals
to
recover
on
the
shares
which
they
had
sold
under
these
representations,
either
to
the
defendant
below
or
to
the
corporation.
the
court
then
went
on
and
allowed
the
receivers
to
recover
the
value
of
the
stock
which
this
court
of
appeals
said
had
been
issued
without
consideration.
so
there
were
two
recoveries,
the
individual
plaintiffs
on
the
shares
which
they
had
sold
and
the
receivers
on
account
of
the
stock
issued
without
consideration.
as
the
federal
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
question
was
whether
the
claims
of
the
stockholders
who
did
not
have
diversity
of
citizenship
in
the
state
court
and
those
who
intervened
in
the
federal
court
could
be
heard
because
there
were
common
questions
of
law
and
fact,
and
common
reliefs
sought
under
federal
rule
23
(a)
(3).
in
other
words,
was
it
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
spurious
class
action,
an
action
which
has
in
common
questions
of
law
and
fact,
but
no
jural
connection
between
the
parties.
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
such
a
case
and
that
in
the
--
that
such
cases,
only
the
original
plaintiff
needed
to
establish
diversity
of
citizenship
and
that
then,
others
could
come
in
regardless
of
their
own
citizenship.
mr.
dean
acheson
this
comes
in
later,
your
honor,
if
i
may
--
mr.
dean
acheson
--
bring
that
in.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
not
involved.
there
was
the
jurisdictional
amount.
that
--
that
is
not
an
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
dean
acheson
only
diversity,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
only
diversity.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
--
they
are
in
the
petitions
for
intervention.
which
--
which
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
dean
acheson
yes.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
relief
asked
for
by
the
plaintiff
is
on
page
8
of
the
record,
follows
in
--
i
guess
17,
18.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
dean
acheson
now,
the
interveners
come
along
--
mr.
dean
acheson
they
--
we
have
interveners'
complaint
of
an
h.
c.
wadleigh
on
page
21.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes.
they
--
they're
all
the
same.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
asked
for
the
same
(voice
overlap).
mr.
dean
acheson
they
--
yes
sir,
they
do.
mr.
dean
acheson
they
do.
after
the
court
made
the
decision
to
which
i
referred,
a
petition
for
rehearing
is
filed
and
as
result
of
that
petition
for
rehearing,
the
court
of
appeals
withdrew
its
judgment
and
its
opinion.
because
it
appeared
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
when
it
--
it
ought
--
have
allowed
the
receivers
to
recover
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
the
result
of
their
action
there
was
that
the
purchaser
of
the
corporation
stopped.
it
was
not
involved
in
this
suit
at
all.
it
was
an
outside
corporation.
and
then
on,
all
the
stock
of
the
corporation
would
as
a
result
of
the
receiver's
success
merely
recover
a
large
part
of
his
purchase
price
back
again.
and
since
that
was
not
an
equitable
result,
it
withdrew
the
judgment
and
decision.
and
then
it
held
that
each
plaintiff
and
each
intervener
who
had
established
that
he
had
fraudulent
representations
made
to
him,
was
permitted
to
recover
both
for
the
wrong
against
himself
and
for
the
wrong
against
the
corporation,
which
the
court
went
on
to
say,
was
not
really
a
wrong
against
the
corporation
but
had
now
been
transformed
into
a
wrong
against
the
interveners
and
the
plaintiffs.
so
these
were
merged
together
and
each
plaintiff
and
intervener
was
allowed
to
recover
on
his
own
right.
in
regard
to
jurisdiction,
the
court
affirmed
its
earlier
finding
that
the
jurisdiction
allay
in
rule
23
(a)
(3)
that
these
suits
were
joined
together
by
common
questions
of
fact
in
law
and
common
relief
was
asked.
we
asked
the
certiorari
to
this
court
on
both
questions,
both
on
the
fact
that
the
court
had
been
wrong
in
reversing
the
district
court
on
facts
and
also
that
the
court
had
been
wrong.
i'm
saying
that
under
rule
23
(a)
(3)
where
there
were
common
questions
only
of
law
and
fact
that
each
intervener
or
plaintiff
did
not
have
to
establish
federal
jurisdiction
independently.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
jurisdictional
question
only
and
our
brief
present
as
a
--
presents
it
here
as
it
was
presented
to
your
honors.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
number
of
persons
asserting
separate
and
distinct
demands
as
--
as
to
which
there
were
some
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
may
intervene
in
the
proceeding
in
a
federal
court
regardless
of
the
citizenship
of
each
intervener
or
of
the
jurisdictional
requirements
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
might
do,
merely
because
the
original
plaintiff
in
this
so-called
spurious
class
action
possessed
the
requisite
jurisdictional
requirements
including
diversity
of
citizenship.
that
was
what
we
thought
was
the
question
presented
and
that
was
the
question
on
which
this
court
allowed
certiorari.
but
in
his
brief
on
the
merits
filed
on
the
11th
of
october
before
this
court,
my
learned
and
distinguished
brother,
counsel
for
the
respondents
says
that
that
is
not
the
question
presented
at
all.
it's
quite
a
different
question.
and
he
says
that
the
court
was
led
to
believe
that
that
was
the
question
presented
on
account
of
representations
by
me.
now,
of
course
nothing
could
show
me
with
more
regret
than
to
have
led
this
court
into
error,
which
would
be
wasteful
of
its
time.
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
perhaps
my
responsibility
is
reduced
here
and
the
likelihood
that
error
has
occurred
is
practically
minimized
by
the
fact
that
my
distinguished
brother
took
exactly
this
attitude
quite
successfully
in
both
the
lower
courts
in
this
very
case.
it
was
he
who
argued
that
this
case
fell
on
this
rule
23
(a)
(3),
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
he
who
argued
that
under
rule
23
(a)
(3),
it
was
necessary
only
to
establish
diversity
of
citizenship
and
the
original
plaintiff
and
that
all
others
could
come
flooding
in
under
that
protection.
we
unfortunately,
were
quite
unsuccessful
in
both
the
lower
courts.
first
of
all,
it
was
argued
that
this
wasn't
a
class
suit
of
any
sort,
spurious
or
otherwise.
but
if
we
were
wrong
about
that
and
if
my
brother
was
right,
nevertheless,
even
under
section
23
(a)
(3),
each
plaintiff
or
intervener
must
establish
his
own
right
to
be
in
a
federal
court.
however,
we
were
swept
away
by
the
success
of
our
opponent's
advocacy
and
the
court
held
with
him
that
this
was
an
(a)
--
23
(a)
(3)
case,
that
it
was
bound,
all
these
cases
were
bound
together
by
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
and
a
common
recovery
and
in
such
a
case,
it
was
not
necessary
to
establish
more
than
the
original
plaintiff's
diversity
of
citizenship.
counsel
who
was
self-triumphant
in
presenting
that
point
of
view
to
the
court
below
now
charge
us
with
--
perhaps
indicating
something
which
was
not
altogether
accurate
in
saying
that
that
is
the
question
involved
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
court
will
understand
that
perhaps
we
experience
some
of
the
emotions
of
the
lamb
in
aesop's
fable
which
was
abraded
by
the
wolf
for
polluting
the
stream
from
which
the
wolf
was
drinking,
although
the
unfortunate
lamb
was
a
long
way
downstream
from
the
wolf.
but
however
that
may
be.
we
have
collected
all
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
the
respondents
in
our
brief,
ten
pages
of
these
arguments
in
the
reply
brief
on
pages
10
to
14
--
4
to
14,
to
indicate
that
their
view
at
that
time
was
quite
identical
with
the
view
which
we
hold
now
as
to
the
question
which
is
presented.
we
leave
this
phase
of
the
argument
without
dwelling
on
--
on
those
formal
expressions
of
our
opponents
with
perhaps
only
two
comments.
one
is
to
paraphrase
a
remark
which
i
heard
made
from
this
bench
a
great
many
years
ago
by
mr.
justice
holmes,
who
--
who
said
that
when
counsel
come
to
reconcile
his
present
exegesis
with
his
past
position,
he
may
count
on
my
undivided
attention.
the
other
observation
is
that
however
unlikely
it
may
be
that
counsel
on
both
sides
in
this
case
and
both
lower
courts
have
been
wholly
wrong
about
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction,
it
is
still
conceivable
and
it
still
falls
within
the
power
of
the
human
mind
to
grasp
that
that
might
be
so,
and
therefore,
it's
necessary
to
turn
to
a
consideration
of
what
our
opponents
believed
as
the
question
presented
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
whereas
they
thought
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
a
common
law
and
common
fact
question
and
fell
under
rule
23
(a)
(3),
they
have
now
discovered
that
it
isn't
that
sort
of
a
case
at
all.
it's
a
case
involving,
they
believe,
interdependent
claims
to
a
common
fund
and
therefore,
falls
not
under
23
(a)
(3)
but
under
23
(a)
(2).
but
they
believe
it
is
a
--
a
case
exactly
like
a
creditor's
bill
case,
you
know,
where
there
has
been
a
fraudulent
transaction,
receivers
are
appointed
upon
this,
brought
into
court,
all
creditors
come
in
and
the
fund
is
divided
among
those
who
--
who
come
into
court.
and
they
are
of
course
--
it
is
a
long
and
well-established
rule
that
if
the
plaintiff
has
diversity
of
citizenship,
then
the
distribution
of
the
fund
to
others
who
may
have
an
interest
in
it,
that
is
merely
ancillary
to
the
original
proceeding,
and
therefore,
they
may
come
in,
because
clearly,
if
they
did
not
come
in,
their
rights
would
be
cut
off.
the
fund
is
going
to
be
distributed
and
their
rights
would
be
--
would
--
would
be
gone.
but
in
the
present
case,
there's
no
common
fund
at
all.
instead,
here
are
a
group
of
separate
plaintiffs
and
interveners.
they're
all
plaintiffs
who
have
claims
based
upon
fraudulent
representations
alleged
to
have
been
made
to
each
one
of
them.
it
is
alleged
that
each
one
of
them
relied
on
his
fraudulent
reputation
--
representations,
that
each
one
took
action
and
each
one
suffered
a
loss.
and
as
a
result
of
all
of
that,
it
is
said
that
the
defendant
became
a
constructive
trustee
and
that
he
holds
their
stock
and
the
proceeds
of
their
stock
for
them.
they're
clearly
--
there
are
separate
recovery
sought
against
a
defendant.
they
have
no
jural
connection
whatever
with
one
another
and
they
are
both
together
for
trial
merely
because
there
are
common
questions
of
fact
and
common
questions
of
law
and
common
money
judgments
asked,
not
to
have
a
participation
in
a
fund,
but
have
to
--
to
have
individual
judgments
against
the
petitioner,
black.
now,
there
would
be
no
argument
about
this
at
all
if
the
facts
were
simply
that
the
defendant
acquired
the
stock
from
the
individual
plaintiffs,
kept
it
until
the
dissolution
of
the
company
and
then
received
so
much
for
each
purchase
of
stock.
clearly
then,
each
purchaser
will
be
seen
to
be
coming
to
the
defendant
and
asking
for
the
value
of
his
stock
which
had
been
purchased
as
a
result
of
the
fraudulent
representations
before.
but
here,
there
are
two
facts,
which
while
they
do
not
change
the
--
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
common
fund,
whatever,
do
make
the
computation
only
a
slightly
bit
--
slight
bit
more
complicated.
these
facts
are
--
are
the
following.
i
mentioned
a
little
while
ago
that
a
--
the
defendant
was
accused
of
having
taken
stock
for
the
corporation
for
which
he
paid
no
adequate
consideration.
the
lower
court
held
that
he
did
pay
adequate
consideration
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
said
no.
now
as
to
that
stock,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"since
no
adequate
consideration
was
paid
for
it,
we
regard
it
as
cancelled,
just
strike
it
out.
in
determining
what
the
value
per
share
was
on
dissolution,
pay
no
attention
to
that
stuff.
furthermore,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
not
all
of
the
stock
purchased
from
all
the
plaintiffs
and
intervene
--
intervenors
was
held
by
the
defendant.
some
of
it
in
his
capacity
as
president
of
the
company,
he
had
retired.
so
the
court
says,
"strike
out
the
stock
which
he
got
without
payment
of
adequate
consideration
and
add
on
the
shares
which
were
retired."
now,
that
the
biggest
shares
which
he
got
allegedly
without
compensation
numbered
32
odd
thousand.
the
number
of
shares
which
were
retired,
numbered
31
odd
thousand
shares.
so
the
simple
result
is
that
you
detract
from
the
stock
about
1000
shares.
you
take
away
32,
you
add
31,
the
difference
is
one
and
therefore,
instead
of
having
86,000
shares
outstanding,
there
were
85
something,
and
each
stockholder's
value
of
his
stock
is
computed
on
--
on
the
basis
of
the
smaller
outstanding
shares.
it
--
it
makes
no
difference
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
ultimate
value
of
the
stock.
on
dissolution,
the
value
per
share
was
according
to
respondent's
figures,
$51.06.
as
a
result
of
all
these
computation,
it
turns
out
to
be
$51.75,
a
trivial
and
unimportant
modification
of
--
of
that
share
value.
still,
each
claimant
is
claiming
a
money
judgment
against
the
defendant.
each
claimant
is
claiming
the
value
of
his
stock,
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
is
that
the
per
share
value
instead
of
$51.06
is
now
$51.75.
it
still
leaves
it
individual
claims
against
an
individual
defendant.
now,
our
opponents
have
a
difficult
time
in
suggesting
that
this
creates
a
common
fund.
so
they're
going
to
change
the
argument
and
say
the
claims
are
interdependent.
well
now,
why
are
they
interdependent?
what
--
what
is
interdependent
about?
they
say
because
each
respondent
who
is
--
each
plaintiff
who
is
victorious
affects
the
case
in
two
ways.
one
way
in
which
he
affects
it
is
that
he
is
entitled
to
recover.
another
way
in
which
he
affects
it
is
that
his
shares,
if
they
have
been
retired,
have
to
be
added
back
in.
therefore,
the
more
shares
that
are
added
back
in,
the
greater
the
total
outstanding
shares
and
when
you
divide
it,
the
--
the
denominator
of
the
fraction
is
reduced
or
changed.
this
is
a
pure
calculation.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
common
fund
and
it
--
it
really
isn't
true
even
in
fact
that
each
--
that
recovery
of
each
claimant
affects
the
result.
now,
why
is
that
so?
because
as
i've
suggested
a
moment
ago,
some
of
the
shares
which
were
purchased
were
not
retired.
therefore,
to
the
extent
of
all
those
who
are
not
retired,
clearly,
you
don't
add
their
shares
to
the
outstanding
stock
because
they
were
outstanding
still.
there
is
no
--
that
affects
the
computation
in
no
way.
the
important
thing
is
that
all
of
these
has
to
do
with
computing
the
value
of
some
shares
for
which
defendant
as
held
by
the
circuit
court,
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
a
constructive
trustee,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
common
fund.
there
is
no
fund
of
money
which
is
to
be
divided
among
all
these
people.
each
one
has
a
separate
claim.
each
one
has
to
make
out
his
own
right
to
recover
by
showing
that
representations
were
made
to
it.
each
one
has
to
make
out
that
he
--
he
relied
upon
these
representations
enacted
to
his
objection.
now,
if
this
is
so,
then
clearly,
this
is
a
--
a
case
of
common
questions
of
law
and
fact,
the
questions
--
a
case
under
23
(a)
(3).
if
that
is
the
case,
then
we
assert
that
each
claimant
has
to
make
out
his
own
right
to
come
into
a
federal
court
and
that
conclusion
is
hardly
disputed
in
the
brief
on
the
merits
by
our
opponents.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
only
--
yes,
your
honor.
this
branch
of
the
case,
the
only
one
that
i
know
--
well,
i
--
i
--
there
may
be
some
others,
i
don't
wish
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
--
there
may
be
some
others
but
if
they
are,
they're
district
court
cases.
the
--
let
me
examine
for
a
moment
the
--
this
matter
that
i've
just
been
stating,
perhaps
somewhat
dogmatically,
that
this
is
a
case
of
separate
actions,
and
not
a
case
of
a
common
fund.
now,
it
so
happens
that
in
the
second
circuit,
in
a
group
of
five
cases
or
more,
i've
only
picked
out
five
here,
all
this
i
did
by
an
overlapping
group
of
the
most
distinguished
judges
in
the
second
circuit.
the
two
hands,
judges
swan,
chase,
frank,
clark,
and
a
visitor
from
the
third
circuit
in
one
of
them,
judge
maris.
in
all
--
these
cases,
they
point
out
a
line
between
what
is
a
common
fund
case
and
the
reasons
why
they're
--
only
the
jurisdiction
needs
to
be
acquired
over
by
the
original
plaintiff
and
these
separate
cases
by
only
a
question
of
common
law
and
fact
is
involved.
in
the
first
one,
it
is
--
it
is
the
case
--
excellance
of
--
of
a
fund
case.
this
is
very
much
relied
on
by
respondents
in
this
case.
it's
the
dickinson
case
and
if
ever
there
was
a
case
of
a
common
fund,
this
is
it.
in
that
case,
a
group
of
people
subscribed
$600,000
for
a
common
financial
purpose.
this
fund
was
embezzled.
people
ran
off
for
the
whole
effect.
now,
$176,000
was
traced
to
two
men.
the
--
they
had
--
they
were
found
in
possession
of
that
much
of
the
--
of
the
swag.
two
of
the
subscribers
who
had
diversity
of
citizenship
as
against
a
and
b
who
went
off
with
the
money,
brought
them
into
the
federal
court
and
there,
it
was
proved
and
judgment
was
given
that
they
had
improperly
taken
these
funds.
at
this
point,
by
service
by
publication,
by
registered
mail,
all
possible
ways,
all
the
available
living
reachable,
original
subscribers
were
brought
into
court
and
there,
they
were
given
their
proportionate
share
of
the
$176,000.
of
course
they
weren't
quite
all.
of
the
people,
some
had
died
or
moved
away,
but
vastly
more
than
--
than
$176,000.
so
their
proportion
was
whatever
they
subscribed,
the
fraction
over
$600,000
divided
into
the
176.
now
the
court
says,
"the
presence
of
all
these
other
people
is
ancillary
to
our
distribution
of
this
fund
of
$176,000.
we
have
it
properly
before
us.
we
have
to
distribute
it,
and
therefore,
we
must
have,
regardless
of
--
of
citizenship
of
the
people
who
claim
an
interest
in
that
fund."
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
a
case
that
the
one
before
this
court
is
not.
and
it's
pointed
out
in
the
very
next
case.
it's
--
the
one
i
have
just
mentioned
is
a
case
exactly
like
stewart
versus
dunham
which
your
honors
decided,
and
is
a
case
of
a
creditor's
bill,
but
you
said
the
same
thing.
now,
in
the
next
case,
this
shows
where
the
line
is
drawn.
it's
a
case
of
ayer
versus
kemper
in
the
48
f.2d.
here
we
had
judges
learned
hand,
swan
and
chase.
judge
chase
holds
over
from
the
earlier
case.
here,
kemper
was
the
receiver
of
a
railway
and
a
fiduciary
for
ayer
and
the
other
note
holders
who
--
whose
security
he
held.
by
fraudulent
representations,
the
trustee
purchased
from
the
note
holders
their
notes,
both
by
positive
representations
and
by
the
suppression
of
information,
which
it's
--
was
his
duty
to
disclose.
question
then
arose
whether
persons
not
before
the
court
were
bound
by
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
that
case,
and
judges
hand,
swan
and
chase
said,
"most
certainly
not."
each
one
of
these
men
has
a
separate
--
totally
a
separate
action
against
kemper.
he
--
he
misled
each
one
separately.
each
one
relied
separately
on
the
misrepresentation
and
each
one
is
bound.
those
who
are
not
before
the
court
are
not
bound
and
each
one
must
establish
his
own
federal
right
to
come
into
a
federal
court.
there
was
no
common
fund.
they
were
separate
suits.
then
come
in
to
one
other
case
in
this
in
the
second
circuit,
164
federal,
steele
versus
the
guaranty
trust
company.
there,
the
judges
were
learned
hand,
augustus
hand
and
jerome
frank.
in
that
case,
the
guaranty
trust
company
was
a
trustee
of
note
issue.
by
breach
of
its
fiduciary
duties,
it
failed
to
take
action
against
the
debtor
until
so
much
of
his
assets
were
dissipated
that
only
49%
on
--
on
each
note's
value
could
be
recovered.
he
didn't
even
act
then.
so
each
one
of
these
note
holders
joined
in
together
in
a
suit,
brings
action
against
the
guaranty
trust
company
saying,
"your
breach
of
duty
lost
me
at
least
49%
of
my
investment."
and
the
court
said,
"these
are
separate
suits."
judge
frank's
language,
"is
a
'conjuries'
of
separate
suits
under
rule
23
(a)
(3)
where
each
claimant
must
prove
federal
jurisdiction."
then
i
had
another
case
very
much
like
it,
miller
versus
the
national
city
bank.
in
that
case,
we
have
judge
learned
hand,
judge
swan
and
judge
frank.
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
national
city
bank
was
alleged
to
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
with
the
guaranty
to
induce
note
holders
under
towards
--
where
that
guaranty
was
a
trustee
of
security
for
the
notes,
not
to
take
action
against
the
guaranty
until
the
fund
had
been
used
by
the
guaranty
for
purposes
of
its
own.
in
this
case,
these
judges
again
said,
"these
are
separate
claims.
what
you
say
in
effect
is
that
the
national
city
bank
deceived
each
one
of
you.
each
one
of
you
was
induced
not
to
proceed
against
the
guaranty
until
the
funds
were
gone.
there
is
no
jural
connection
between
you,
there
is
no
fund
in
the
hands
of
the
national
city.
you
are
suing
it
for
breach
of
trust
and
--
and
tort
claim."
another
case
of
the
same
court
is
(inaudible)
company.
here
we
had
judge
learned
hand
and
judge
chase
and
judge
frank.
that
case
was
held
that
stockholders
who
bring
a
suit
for
injunction
against
the
corporation
to
prevent
the
sale
of
stock
and
alleged
violation
of
their
preemptive
rights
have
separate
suits
against
the
corporation.
the
suits
are
--
are
brought
together
by
reason
of
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
under
rule
23
(a)
(3)
and
each
must
prove
his
own
right
to
come
into
the
federal
court.
now,
your
honors,
this
has
been
a
long
excursion
in
pursuit
of
--
of
respondent's
statement
as
what
is
the
question
presented
to
you?
but
i
think
it
has
not
been
wholly
wasted
because
i
think
it
does
show
us
that
the
present
case
is
truly
a
case
of
separate
claim.
there
is
no
common
fund.
there's
no
jural
connection
between
these
people.
each
one
says
he
was
deceived
or
she
was
deceived.
each
one
says
he
or
she
relied
on
these
representations
and
indeed
in
the
court
below,
it
was
found
that
some
did
and
some
didn't.
and
therefore,
those
who
did
not
rely
or
were
not
deceived
were
not
allowed
to
recover
and
those
who
were
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
were
allowed
to
recover.
and
i
think
it
shows
also
to
us
the
reason.
this
is
not
merely
an
arbitrary
--
arbitrary
matter
of
saying,
"well,
if
you're
under
section
23
(a)
(2),
you
don't
have
to
show
federal
jurisdiction,
but
if
you
put
--
make
the
number
3
than
you
do,
that
isn't
the
point."
the
point
is
that
where
there
are
separate
suits,
those
who
are
not
before
the
court
are
not
bound
by
the
result,
whereas,
if
there
are
separate
suits,
where
--
where
there
are
separate
suits,
they
are
not
bound
by
the
result
and
therefore,
they
must
prove
their
right
to
come
in.
each
one
has
his
own
lawsuit
and
he
must
prove
his
right
to
come
in
to
a
federal
court.
whereas,
if
there
is
a
fund
and
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
fund,
because
the
original
plaintiff
had
diversity,
then
the
claims
of
these
intervenors
in
such
a
case
are
purely
ancillary.
the
court
is
going
to
dispose
of
the
fund.
the
fund
is
there
in
court
to
be
divided
and
everyone
claiming
an
interest
must
in
right
be
able
to
come
in.
the
first
case,
i've
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
judge
frank
said,
"these
are
merely
a
'conjuries'
of
--
of
separate
cases.
judge
prettyman
in
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
says
that
the
joinder
of
cases
such
as
the
one
involved
here
is
a
matter
of
economy
and
efficiency
on
the
part
of
courts
and
parties,
an
avoidance
of
multiplicity
of
suits."
and
he
goes
on
to
point
out
that
each
claimant
or
intervenor
must
prove
his
own
right
to
be
in
a
federal
court.
even
professor
moore
upon
whose
writings
the
court
below
relied
and
they
were
recited
--
cited
by
the
respondents,
the
court
below
followed
them.
even
professor
moore
who
--
whose
reasons
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
says
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
dean
acheson
because
he
is
--
i'll
tell
you
why,
your
honor.
professor
moore
is
--
is
the
author
of
the
view
that
in
this
23
(a)
(3)
cases,
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
a
jurisdiction
if
the
original
plaintiff
has
jurisdiction.
originally,
in
support
of
that
view,
we
gave
your
honor's
decision
in
the
stewart
case.
the
stewart
case
however
was
patently
a
case
of
a
common
fund.
so
in
the
second
edition
of
his
works,
he
dropped
the
stewart
case
and
he
put
in
shipley
case
from
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
now,
it
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
writers
on
this
subject
that
the
only
authority
cited
in
the
shipley
case
is
professor
moore.
and
now,
the
only
authority
cited
by
professor
moore
is
the
shipley
case.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
beg
your
pardon.[laughter]
this
is
a
good
way
to
work.[laughter]
you
can
really
build
up
a
reputation
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
even
professor
moore,
if
you
would
find
me
for
another
reputation
of
the
word
"even,"
your
honor.
professor
moore,
although
he
says
there
is
no
jural
connection
between
the
claimants,
plaintiffs
and
interveners
in
the
--
in
the
suit
bound
together
with
common
questions
of
law
and
fact,
he
draws
an
odd
conclusion
from
that.
he
says
that
if
there
are
only
a
few
such
plaintiffs
or
interveners,
then
they
must
act
under
rule
24
(b).
they
must
ask
to
intervene.
and
when
they
ask
to
intervene,
they
must
show
federal
jurisdiction.
but
if
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
then,
then
they
join
together
under
rule
23
(a)
(3)
and
come
in
as
a
spurious
class
and
then
they
don't
have
to
show
it
at
all.
and
he
says
the
reason
for
this
is
procedural
convenience.
in
other
words,
there
are
only
two
or
three,
you
have
to
show
--
each
one
shows
his
federal
jurisdiction.
but
if
they're
more
than
that,
you
don't.
and
this
--
in
writing
about
it,
--
professor
hart
at
harvard
and
professor
wechsler
of
columbia
asked
whether
it's
--
they
say,
"is
the
supreme
court
likely
to
uphold
this
use
of
rule
23
(a)
(3)
to
accomplish
so
bold
an
enlargement
of
federal
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
in
large
measure,
this
court
has
indicated
the
correct
principles
here
in
clark
versus
paul
gray,
incorporated
in
306
united
states.
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
your
honor,
our
argument
leads
to
this.
we
say
that
only
in
those
cases
where
there
was
diversity
did
the
court
have
jurisdiction
to
any
--
under
any
kind
of
a
decree.
now,
we
will
come
--
i'll
come
right
to
it
now.
our
opponents
say
to
us,
--
well,
this
is
just
a
dry
legal
question
because
they
only
admit
that
there
are
two
people
who
--
who
are
citizens
of
california,
which
is
the
state
of
which
the
defendant
is
a
citizen.
i
say
it's
clear
about
these
two.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it's
very
unclear
about
the
rest
of
them
because
there
are
no
allegations
as
to
their
citizenship
except
the
original
plaintiff.
there
is
very
sketchy
proof,
no
request
for
findings
of
fact
and
no
findings
of
(inaudible).
some
of
them
may
not
have
diversity,
some
may,
but
that
is
unimportant.
so
far
as
these
two
are
concerned,
their
phrase
is,
"we
would
have
won
a
skirmish,
but
lost
the
war,"
if
your
honors
decide
as
we
urge
you
to
decide.
we
think
we
can
worry
about
what
we
have
won
or
lost.
in
fact,
these
two
people
have
claims
which
on
one
basis,
the
respondent's
calculation
are
said
to
be
$100,000,
on
another
basis,
$200,000.
so
it's
an
--
substantial
in
and
of
itself.
but
the
--
the
thing
that
is
really
important
here
is
if
this
jurisdictional
question
is
straightened
out,
and
the
cases
go
back
to
the
--
reconsidered
on
the
basis
of
proper
jurisdiction,
then
there
arises
a
question
which
really
may
go
to
the
very
heart
of
this
recovery
and
that
is
whether
the
black-marshall
oil
company
is
a
necessary
party
defendant.
if
it
is,
it
is
a
citizen
of
illinois
and
certainly
a
large
number
of
these
plaintiffs
who
claim
to
have
lived
in
illinois
at
the
time
these
actions
took
place
are
citizens
of
the
same
state
as
a
necessary
defendant.
now,
whether
it's
a
necessary
defendant
or
not,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
decide,
although
we
are
scolded
by
our
opponents
for
discussing
some
matters
beyond
the
strict
jurisdictional
question.
we
discuss
them
to
show
that
this
is
not
a
dry
legal
question
but
a
very
important
one.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes
sir.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
no,
no,
mr.
justice
black.
we
are
not
claiming
that
at
all,
sir.
all
we
are
claiming
is
that
the
one
person
cannot
come
in.
mr.
dean
acheson
then
it
gets
dismissed
out.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir.
but
what
i'm
now
saying
is
that
when
you
straighten
out
this
jurisdictional
tangle,
it
goes
back
to
the
lower
court.
there,
we
can
say
to
the
lower
court,
"now,
you
are
paying
no
attention
to
the
citizenship
of
these
people
because
you
believed
it
was
unimportant."
it
is
very
important
that
the
black-marshall
oil
company
be
--
come
back
into
this
case
as
a
necessary
party
defendant.
and
if
it
does,
then
a
very
large
number
of
people
have
to
be
dismissed
out.
they
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
in
the
state
court,
many
grave
errors
of
state
law
will
be
corrected.
errors
pointed
out
by
judge
phillips
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
dean
acheson
it
was
a
party
defendant,
your
honor.
it
wasn't
--
wasn't
brought
in
by
us.
it
was
the
first
party
defendant
named
in
the
long,
long
list
in
the
suits
brought
by
my
opponents.
now,
how
did
it
disappear
out
of
this
case?
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
it
disappeared
in
a
very
interesting
way.
amen,
the
plaintiff
in
the
original
proceeding,
this
corporation
had
--
had
been
dissolved
under
--
it
was
--
under
the
law
of
illinois,
it
had
two
years
when
it
should
be
resurrected.
and
before
the
two
years
were
out,
amen
asked
for
receivers
to
be
appointed.
the
receivers
were
appointed
by
the
district
court
in
illinois,
and
one
of
the
receivers
is
an
illinois
citizen,
the
other
is
a
kansas
citizen.
so
the
two
receivers
appear
in
the
district
court
in
kansas.
they
filed
a
suit
against
black.
they
intervened
in
the
other
person's
suit
as
plaintiffs.
they
then
asked
for
the
corporation
to
be
dismissed
so
that
an
illinois
defendant
is
whisked
out
of
the
case
before
you
could
hardly
notice
it
and
in
comes
the
receivers
as
plaintiffs.
so,
diversity
has
--
has
that
--
has
gotten
rid
of
this
very
difficult
and
tricky
problem
of
diversity.
the
illinois
defendant
is
out.
in
its
place,
there
is
an
illinois
plaintiff.
so
we
say
this
is
one
of
the
vitally
important
question
--
mr.
dean
acheson
no.
mr.
dean
acheson
your
honor,
if
--
if
this
case
went
back
with
the
instructions
which
we
hope
you
would
give
then
we
believe
that
in
the
district
court,
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
of
course
correct
its
error
and
send
the
case
on
down
to
the
district
court.
and
in
the
district
court,
we
believe
that
there,
we
would
say,
"now,
the
supreme
court
has
told
you
that
you
are
proceeding
quite
wrongly."
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
thrown
these
receivers
out
of
the
case.
they're
no
longer
in
the
case
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"they
have
no
right
to
recover.
they're
out."
very
well,
then
we
go
back
to
where
we
were
before.
we
have
the
corporation
as
a
defendant.
we
have
the
corporation
out,
we
have
the
receivers
in,
the
receivers
are
now
out,
let's
have
the
corporation
back."
and
if
the
corporation
is
back
then
those
citizens
who
turn
out
to
be
citizens
of
illinois
will
have
to
go
to
the
state
court.
now,
whether
in
the
state
court
the
same
record
would
be
used
is
a
matter
of
the
counsel
at
the
trial.
now,
those
people
who
--
who
had
survived
this
correct
diversity
test
would
of
course
remain
and
then
whatever
judgments
they
are
entitled
to
would
not
be
effective.
but
people
who
never
had
a
right
to
be
in
court
will
have
to
go
to
a
court
where
they
have
a
right
to
be.
mr.
dean
acheson
we
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
know.
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
there
are
--
there
are
two
who
clearly
do
not.
mr.
dean
acheson
now,
we
know
that
one
does.
mr.
dean
acheson
now,
what
happens
to
the
rest,
i
don't
know.
mr.
dean
acheson
mr.
smith
believes
that
they
all
satisfied.
mr.
dean
acheson
and
cannot
tell
from
this
record.
mr.
dean
acheson
well
--
that's
--
that's
quite
correct,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
should
think
so.
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
amen,
the
original
plaintiff
in
the
original
suit,
he
was
the
sole
plaintiff,
nobody
else,
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
north
--
south
dakota,
i
forgot
which
one
it
is.
mr.
dean
acheson
but
as
to
him,
there
is
diversity,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
dean
acheson
two
are
plainly
not.
there
are
great
many
about
whom
there
is
such
evidence
as,
“well,
i
live
in
this
place”
or
“i'm
the
wife
of
someone
who
lives
in
some
place.”
but
there
are
no
allegations,
no
findings
of
fact
and
it's
only
fugitive
testimony.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
(inaudible).
now,
may
i
just
take
one
further
moment
and
save
the
rest
of
my
time
because
our
opponents
have
introduced
into
their
brief
filed
in
october
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
new
thought.
and
that
is
that
there
on
pages
48
and
51
of
their
brief,
they
say
that
--
there's
a
federal
question
here,
this
is
--
case
really
don't
have
to
rest
on
diversity
at
all,
that
their
cause
of
action
was
stated
and
proved
under
a
rule
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
was
authorized
by
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934.
now,
although
this
case
was
filed,
these
petitions
were
filed
at
1949,
no
evidence,
no
argument,
oral
or
written,
has
ever
been
based
on
this
claim.
it
is
not
imperative
before
until
this
time.
in
the
district
court,
no
findings
of
fact
or
conclusions
of
law
were
asked
for
on
the
basis
of
any
federal
question
being
involved
here.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
no
argument.
in
the
brief
and
opposition
in
this
court,
it
was
not
mentioned.
even
in
the
brief
on
the
merits,
the
respondents
do
not
suggest
that
this
claim
which
they
now
advance
for
the
first
time
is
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
mention
of
this
so-called
rule,
which
is
a
rule
indeed
of
the
sec
until
this
brief.
there
was
not
even
a
mention
of
the
act
of
1934
in
any
pleading
which
is
shown
in
the
record
as
certified
by
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court.
so
tenuous
is
this
claim
that
counsel
for
the
respondents
did
not
even
notice
until
october
1957
that
an
amendment
to
a
pleading
which
they
have
made
earlier
had
been
left
out
of
the
record
ever
since
1954.
they
amended
the
pleadings
by
striking
out
a
reference
to
one
federal
statute
and
putting
in
a
reference
to
another.
that
was
in
1949.
in
printing
the
record
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
this
reference
was
left
out,
they
didn't
even
notice
it,
the
three
and
a
half
years,
so
little
attention
that
they
pay
to
it.
what
actually
happened
is
--
on
paragraph
19
on
page
8
of
the
record.
in
their
original
complaint,
they
have
an
information,
believe
the
conspirators
--
conspiracies,
joint
ventures
and
unlawful
acts
violated
the
federal
securities
act
of
1933,
the
farm
credit
act
and
various
other
acts.
and
an
--
an
amendment,
they
struck
out
the
farm
credit
act
and
put
in
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1932,
1934.
this
was
left
out
in
printing
the
record,
they
didn't
even
notice
it
for
three
and
a
half
years.
and
in
regard
to
such
an
argument,
i
suggest
only
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
niles-
bement
farm
company
case
that
it
was
an
afterthought.
much
too
casual
in
media
to
give
serious
color
to
the
claim
now
made,
but
the
cause
of
action
asserted
is
one
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
dean
acheson
if
the
court
please.
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
stress.
my
learned
--
learned
friend's
argument,
i
think,
brings
out
forcefully
the
tyranny
of
words.
i'm
not
clear
whether
his
--
the
victim
or
whether
he's
using
words
as
an
ally
to
impose
their
tyranny
on
us.
here,
the
tyrannical
word
is
“fund".
he
accuses
me
of
believing,
which
would
certainly
be
a
naïve
thing
for
a
lawyer
to
believe,
that
there
is
no
fund
unless
there
is
some
money
locked
up
in
the
safe
in
the
clerk's
office,
of
course,
i
have
no
such
fantastic
idea
as
that.
the
term
“common
fund”
and
he
always
keeps
dropping
off
the
important
word
“common".
the
term
“common
fund”
as
it's
used
in
the
law
means
a
definite
sum
of
money
in
which
people
have
rights,
usually
the
rights
exceeding
the
amount
of
money.
the
amount
of
money
is
before
the
court
either
because
the
person
who
owns
it
as
before
the
court
or
because
it
is
paid
in.
let's
figure
all
about
it's
being
paid
in.
in
the
dickinson
case
which
is
his
favorite
case
and
it
is
my
favorite
case
also
because
it
brings
out
very
clearly
what
this
case
is
not.
in
the
dickinson
case,
the
fund
was
a
106
--
$176,000.
it
was
not
in
court,
of
course,
it
wasn't
in
court.
it
was
owned
by
two
men
who
had
stolen
it
and
the
subscribers
to
the
original
fund
of
$600,000
said,
"we
have
a
pro
rata
interest
in
that
fund."
and
the
court
said,
“you
have.
we
now
decide
that
this
fund
was
improperly
taken
by
these
two
men.
all
of
you
who
put
up
the
original
$600,000
have
got
a
pro
rata
interest
and
you
may
all
come
in
and
get
your
interest."
but
the
way
my
learned
friend
uses
the
term
“fund”,
it
means
the
sum
of
all
the
separate
demands
of
all
the
separate
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
he
uses
--
it
would
be
a
fund
in
his
sense
of
the
word
if
i
ran
down
an
automobile
--
with
my
automobile,
it
went
down
a
loading
platform
on
which
50
people
were
standing
and
heard
all
of
them.
if
they
all
sued
me
that
some
total
of
their
claims
would
be,
in
his
view,
a
fund,
because
they
all
have
claims
against
me.
it
all
has
--
came
out
of
a
common
transaction,
their
common
questions
of
law
involved.
therefore,
it's
a
fund.
any
one
person
on
the
loading
platform
had
diversity
of
citizenship
with
me,
then
according
to
his
argument,
they
could
all
come
into
a
federal
court.
but
then
he
keeps
talking
about
a
trust
fund,
the
court
impressed
a
trust
on
a
fund,
or
what
did
the
court
impress
anything
on.
it
isn't
a
fund.
if
there's
any
fund
at
all
and
this
--
these
words
of
trust
are
merely
used
to
describe
the
nature
of
the
recovery,
not
a
sum
of
money.
he
can't
tell
you
what
sum
of
money
is
in
this
fund,
he
doesn't
know.
nobody
will
know
until
the
individual
recoveries
are
added
up.
there
isn't
a
trust
imposed
on
something.
in
the
language
of
the
court,
there
are
all
kinds
of
trust
that
as
--
as
many
trusts
as
there
are
defendants,
but
they
are
separate.
the
point
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
word
“fund".
there's
nothing
common
about
this.
each
plaintiff
has
his
own
separate
recovery.
that
--
and
that
again
is
brought
out
very
clearly
in
cases
like
ayer
versus
kemper
and
miller
versus
the
national
--
the
national
city
which
i
talked
about
yesterday.
then
that
brings
me
to
the
second
part
of
--
of
--
second
point
i
want
to
make.
counsel
was
asked,
what
is
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
it's
an
unjust
enrichment.
that
is
the
basis
of
their
decision
and
why
was
it
the
basis?
because
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
which
is
concurred
in
by
all
four
judges
who
heard
this
case
and
by
counsel,
he
can't
say
one
single
word
against
him.
and
that
is
that
black
paid
these
people,
the
full
value
of
their
stock
when
they
bought
it.
absolutely
down
to
the
last
cent
of
the
full
value.
therefore,
they
have
no
cause
of
action
for
in
fraud
or
in
tort.
so,
what
did
they
do?
they
say,
"well,
there's
a
trust
on
this."
there
was
misrepresentation
here
and
therefore,
you
hold
each
one
of
these
blocks
of
stock,
entrust
for
its
owner
until
the
corporation
is
dissolved,
and
then
you
pay
him
out.
now,
two
things
come
out
of
this.
one
of
them
is,
if
there
is
not
a
common
trust
but
even
on
the
language
of
--
of
the
court,
there
is
a
specific
trust
imposed
on
each
block
of
stock
for
each
owner.
and
the
second
thing
that
comes
out
of
it
that
i
want
to
stress
is
over
and
over
and
over
again
where
we
have
been
arguing
here,
my
friend
has
been
arguing
here
as
though
you
hadn't
granted
certiorari
on
the
first
point,
as
though
we
were
attacking
or
--
or
defending
the
court
of
appeals
in
overruling
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
fraud
at
all,
not
a
different
fraud.
when
we
come
to
the
court
of
appeals,
my
friend
says
there
was
not
a
dividend
court
on
this
question.
there
was
divided
court
on
this
question,
a
proof
of
this
comes
from
reading
the
opinion.
what
the
judge
phillips
decide
on
this
question?
he
decided
that
the
man
who
made
the
misrepresentations,
made
it
within
the
scope
of
--
of
an
agency
which
black
had
given
him.
he
did
not
find.
in
fact,
he
specifically
found
the
other
way
that
black
was
not
responsible
for
what
this
man
said.
therefore,
we
have
two
judges,
the
judge
who
heard
the
case,
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
who
said
this
man
is
not
guilty
of
any
fraud.
but
judge
phillips
joins
with
the
others
and
say,
"we
must
hold
him
liable
for
somebody
else's
fraud
because
he
comes
within
--
it
came
within
the
scope
of
an
agency
given
to
him."
the
other
two
judges
of
course
go
further
and
--
and
say
the
opposite.
but
in
impressing
all
of
this
evidence
when
they
talk
about
fraud
on
this
court,
please
remember
that
out
of
the
four
judges
who
heard
it,
the
judge
who
heard
the
testimony
did
not
believe
it
and
either
did
the
chief
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals.
one
last
word.
we're
talking
--
keep
talking,
my
brother
does
about
the
federal
question
which
is
involved.
i
went
over
it
yesterday
to
show
you
that
this
federal
question
had
never
been
mentioned
in
any
proceeding,
in
any
argument,
in
any
evidence,
in
any
brief
filed
throughout
the
entire
length
of
this
case.
and
my
brother
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
if
fairly
read
would
read
on
this
federal
question.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
the
remotest
idea
that
anyone
dreamed
that
there
was
a
federal
question.
it
wasn't
mentioned
to
it.
it
wasn't
in
the
record
when
--
which
went
up
to
it.
it
wasn't
any
brief
which
was
before
it.
this
federal
question
has
not
been
followed
until
the
brief
filed
on
october
11th,
1957.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
dean
acheson
what
--
what
the
--
what
my
friend
on
the
other
side
is
now
arguing.
the
truth
is
that
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
this
question
of
federal
jurisdiction
on
diversity.
but
as
he
says
a
federal
statute
is
involved.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
sir.
he
is
not.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
that
every
single
decision
which
is
--
is
cited
in
my
friend's
brief,
your
honors,
every
decision
of
this
court
that
he
cites
and
i
would
be
glad
to
apologize
if
there's
a
single
one
of
which
this
isn't
true.
every
one
of
those
single
decisions
says
that,
if
you
have
not
litigated
the
case
or
put
it
the
other
way,
that
in
all
those
cases,
the
federal
statute
was
the
center
of
the
litigation.
a
testimony
was
taken
on
it,
briefs
were
written
about
it,
arguments
were
made
upon
it.
any
of
the
cases,
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
federal
question
and
said,
"no,
we
don't
think
it
is
involved
on
the
court."
and
when
they
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said,
"certainly,
we
think
it's
involved,
it
was
the
center
of
this
case."
therefore,
it
is
a
federal
law
case.
but
there,
he
cannot
find
one
single
solitary
case
to
say
that
when
--
not
a
word
has
been
said
about
it,
not
as
single
solitary
word
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
then
when
we
go
through
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
come
to
this
court.
he
can
certainly
discover
that
all
the
time
that
was
lurking
in
the
background
here,
have
question
under
a
federal
law.
and
if
we
now
read
all
the
proceedings
as
though
they
had
been
taken
under
that
statute,
then
he
can
sustain
his
jurisdiction.
now,
there's
no
support
for
that
theory
in
anything
your
honors
to
decide
it.
mr.
dean
acheson
your
honor,
in
--
in
the
first
place
--
let
me
be
clear
that
we
have
not
asked
in
our
brief
and
i
do
not
ask
in
argument
that
this
court
consider
that
question.
i
do
not
ask
this
court
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
oil
company
is
a
necessary
party
defendant.
you
have
not
granted
certiorari
on
that
question
and
i
quite
understand
that
your
jurisdiction
here
under
your
granting
of
the
writ
is
limited
to
the
federal
jurisdiction
question.
now,
if
your
honors
decide
that
question
in
a
way
in
which
we
urge
you
to
decide
it,
then
when
we
go
back
to
the
district
court,
we
will
say,
"let's
realign
these
parties
in
accordance
with
the
supreme
court's
decision."
you
had
in
this
case
not
brought
in
by
us
but
by
the
other
side
as
their
principal
defendant,
the
first
one
named
in
the
list
of
defendants,
the
first
one
described
in
the
complaint,
the
black
marshall
oil
company,
a
corporation
of
illinois.
we
say
that
corporation
--
we
will
say
to
the
district
court,
this
corporation
is
a
necessary
party.
why
is
it?
because
if
you
read
that
prayer
in
the
complaints,
you
will
see
that
each
one
of
these
interveners
and
stockholders
asks
to
be
restored
to
his
right
as
a
stockholder
of
a
corporation
to
be
given
back
his
stock,
to
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
liquidating
dividend
of
the
corporation.
and
we
say
the
corporation
of
course
is
a
necessary
party.
they
thought
it
was
when
they
brought
the
suit.
and
how
did
it
disappear?
because
they
appointed
receivers
for
it.
the
receivers
came
in
as
party's
plaintiff.
they
asked
for
the
dismissal
of
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
was
dismissed.
now,
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
receivers
out
of
the
case,
said
they
have
no
standing
to
sue.
it
was
--
it'd
be
inequitable
to
allow
them
to
recover.
therefore,
they
are
gone
and
back
must
come,
the
corporation.
the
corporation
must
be
a
party
defendant.
it
cannot
be
a
party
plaintiff.
and
if
it
is,
then
we
all
go
back
to
the
district
court.
we're
not
saying
that
anyone
is
going
to
be
denied
any
of
their
rights
to
make
any
proof.
they
all
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
in
the
state
court,
they
will
discover
the
questions
of
state
law
which
were
erroneously
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
if
you
decide
it
correctly.
and
this
of
course
is
--
is
an
aftermath
to
my
--
my
brother.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
corporation
hadn't
been
dissolved
but
was
within
two
years
of
being
resolved.
and
under
the
law
of
illinois,
on
application,
it
could
be
revived
for
litigating
purposes
and
that
action
was
done,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
no.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
your
honor.
i
think
i've
not
made
myself
clear.
we
--
we
do
not
question
the
fact
that
this
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
that
phase
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
phase,
your
honor,
is
--
is
only
a
way
of
praying
for
relief.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
--
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
acheson
this
--
this
has
been
the
whole
--
this
is
what
i've
been
trying
to
--
to
urge
and
that
is
that
there
is
not
a
trust
fund.
mr.
dean
acheson
this
is
a
separate
--
mr.
dean
acheson
your
honor,
they
do
not
charge
that
there
is.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
black
--
mr.
black
brought
--
mr.
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
--
i
think
you
are
wrong,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
acheson
if
--
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
i
would
say
that
our
position
would
be
well
taken
because
i
would
say
that
it'd
be
perfectly
obvious
on
the
phase
of
the
complaint
that
what
they
mean
by
a
trust
fund
is
a
series
of
trust
funds.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
it
does
--
does
state
a
cause
of
action
because
each
fellow
--
mr.
dean
acheson
--
states
his
own
cause
of
action.
mr.
dean
acheson
your
honor
--
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
i
would
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
acheson
because
it
is
inherit
in
the
situation
that
there
is
not
one
fraud,
the
20
frauds.
mr.
dean
acheson
there
are
20
people,
he
had
separate
people
and
each
one
of
them
says,
i
have
been
defrauded.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
dean
acheson
i'm
saying
that
each
one
of
these
can
claim
that
there
is
a
trust
fund
created
for
him
out
of
the
proceeds
of
his
stock.
mr.
dean
acheson
but
he
has
no
interest
in
--
in
the
proceeds
of
the
next
man
in
stock.
each
fellow
is
interested
only
in
his
own
stock
and
if
there's
any
trust
fund
created,
it's
a
trust
fund
for
each
man
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
securities
of
each
man.
mr.
dean
acheson
not
in
the
slightest
bit.
each
one
would
be
dealt
with
by
himself.
here
is
a
man
who
has
10
shares.
that's
all
he
has.
he
can't
have
any
right
in
anything
more
than
the
proceeds
of
his
10
shares.
now,
either
mr.
black
can
pay
him
that
or
he
can't
pay
him
that.
he
doesn't
grow
on
somebody
else's
shares.
if
he
draws
on
that
--
the
proceeds
of
those
shares.
mr.
dean
acheson
i'm
not
even
challenging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
try
it
at
all,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
dean
acheson
but
because
there
are
some
people
--
mr.
dean
acheson
if
--
if
there
were
--
there
was
no
diversity
in
here
at
all,
the
court
would
not
have
power
to
decide
the
case,
no.
clearly,
it
would
not.
now,
i
think
that
your
honor
perhaps
asking
me
is
this.
are
you
asking
me
--
suppose
one
person
had
diversity
and
everyone
else
did
not,
would
the
case
then
be
properly
in
the
federal
court
in
regard
to
those
who
have
no
diversity?
it
clearly
would
not
because
there
is
no
common
fund,
your
honor.
mr.
dean
acheson
oh,
wasn't
that?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
dean
acheson
a
series
of
constructive
trust.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
