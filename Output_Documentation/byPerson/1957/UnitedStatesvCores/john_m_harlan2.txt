what
would
you
do
with
him
if
he
was
a
commuter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
commutes
from
new
york
to
greenwich,
works
to
new
york,
lives
in
greenwich.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
prosecutor
maybe
in
the
place.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it's
domicile,
perhaps.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
your
theory
work
in
this
situation,
mr.
clifford,
supposing
on
the
28th
day,
the
alien
goes
to
his
lawyer
and
says,
“i
want
to
get
an
extension.”
the
lawyer
says,
“yes,
i'll
go
down.”
and
then
he
gets
reported
back
on
the
29th
day,
the
department
has
got
it
under
consideration.
he
will
know
in
a
week.
then
at
the
end
of
a
week,
which
is
after
the
29th
day,
the
lawyer
says,
“i'm
sorry,
i
can't
get
the
extension.”
the
alien
still
continues
to
remain
in
the
country,
but
he's
living
at
that
time
in
new
york
instead
in
philadelphia.
is
he
committing
an
offense
and
if
so,
where
is
he
--
where
is
the
offense
committed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then
the
mere
past
due,
the
29
days,
would
not
be
so
be
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
answer
to
the
question
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
--
can
you
make
a
broad
generalization
of
that
kind,
a
divorce
from
a
particular
section
of
the
statute
that
constitutes
the
offense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
say
how
can
you
make
a
broad
generalization
of
that
kind
or
it
applies
to
remaining
on
the
one
hand
and
then
on
the
other
and
filing
false
registration
certificates.
the
--
the
content
of
those
offenses
is
different,
isn't
it?
