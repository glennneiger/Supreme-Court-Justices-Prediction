mr.
clark
m.
clifford
thank
you
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
may
it
please,
your
honor.
there
is
involved
in
this
case
an
important
question.
the
determination
of
which
will
not
only
dispose
of
this
controversy
but
will
be
of
substantial
value
to
the
courts
below
in
finding
a
uniformity
of
approach
to
this
problem.
however,
there
is
a
more
important
consideration
than
that
in
this
case.
for
it
appears
to
us
that
under
the
government's
theory,
they
would
deprive
this
defendant
and
other
similarly
situated
of
a
basic
important
right
that
he
is
given
by
the
law.
i
believe
that
my
presentation
would
be
most
effective
and
i
would
trust
most
helpful.
if
i
were
to
point
out
the
two
basic
considerations
upon
which
the
court
below
reached
his
decision,
then
i
shall
refer
to
the
government's
efforts
to
circumvent
that
reason,
so
that
we
might
analyze
the
government's
position
and
see
if
there
is
merit
in
their
contentions.
we
start
with
the
basic
principle
that
this
defendant,
romualdo
cores,
must
be
tried
in
the
district
in
which
the
offense
was
committed.
one
becomes
impressed
with
the
importance
that
our
law
attaches
to
that
consideration.
it
appears
first,
as
your
honors
are
aware,
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
reiterated
in
substance
in
the
sixth
amendment
where
it
said
that
the
man
shall
be
tried
in
the
state
in
the
district
in
which
the
offense
is
perpetrated.
it
goes
on
then
and
that
constitutional
theory
is
carried
into
our
statutory
law
under
rule
18
of
criminal
procedure
which
says
substantially
the
same.
then
in
the
jurisdictional
section
of
the
statutes
on
immigration
appears
section
1329
and
there
it
is
reiterated
again
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
shall
be
found
in
this
section
and
offenses
are
to
be
tried
where
such
offenses
took
place.
now
that's
premise
number
one.
now
the
court
below,
i
must
say
we're
entire
agreement
with
them,
found
that
the
offense
in
this
instance
was
committed
at
the
time
that
romualdo
cores'
permit
expired.
this
man
was
here,
we'll
assume,
on
a
29-day
permit
under
the
immigration
law.
he
was
an
alien
crewman.
that
permit
expired.
now,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
offense
that
took
place
in
this
case
was
the
affirmative
act
of
romualdo
cores
in
staying
in
this
country
after
his
permit
expired.
it
took
no
other
act
on
his
part
or
on
the
part
of
any
other
person.
it's
when
he
decided
to
violate
the
law
and
stay
in
this
country,
and
his
permit
expired,
that
is
the
act
which
we
contend
constituted
the
criminal
act.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i
think
the
answer,
justice
harlan,
is
that
this
statute
provides
that
he
must
willfully
remain,
and
i
believe
that
when
his
lawyer
says
to
him,
“now,
i
have
an
application
here
for
an
extension
and
i
think
we're
going
to
get
it
and
just
hold
on.”
i
don't
believe
he
is
willfully
remaining
under
those
circumstances.
but
that
when
then
such
application
will
say
is
denied,
it's
when
the
willfulness
begins
and
it's
where
he
is
located
at
the
time
that
the
willful
violation
starts
that
he
has
committed
a
crime.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
would
not.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
--
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
there
must
also
be
willfulness.
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
where
on
the
28th
day,
this
defendant
is
struck
by
an
automobile
and
is
rendered
unconscious
and
the
29th
day
comes
and
goes.
he
is
not
willfully
violating
the
law
on
the
29th
day.
but
on
the
30th
day
he
recovers
and
he's
well
and
he
says,
“well,
my
ship's
gone,
i'm
going
to
stay
here.”
he
is
guilty
of
a
willful
violation
on
the
30th
day
and
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
yes.
he
is
still
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
he
is
still
illegally
in
the
country,
but
the
crime
was
committed
where
he
willfully
said,
“i
am
going
to
stay
in
violation
of
this
permit
of
mine.”
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
correct.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
what
i
say
is
that
there
is
a
time
that
the
criminal
act
is
committed
and
we
find
no
intention
that
i
was
going
to
later,
for
this
to
be
a
continuing
offense.
and
the
general
concept
is
that
when
a
crime
is
--
is
enumerated
it
is
considered
to
be
an
--
an
act,
an
affirmative
act.
and
i
say
that
if
--
if
there
is
no
language
that
appears
that
would
indicate
that
it
is
a
continuing
crime
it
then
comes
under
the
general
rule
that
it
is
an
act
at
a
certain
time,
and
that
is
our
construction
that
it
is
an
act
at
a
time.
now,
after
he
commits
the
act,
we
say
that
sets
the
jurisdiction.
now,
he
may
illegally
continue
to
remain
in
the
country,
but
it's
when
he
committed
that
illegal
act
of
remaining
under
the
statute
that
that
sets
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
only
you
said
it
better
than
i.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well,
now
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
exactly.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
that
is
our
contention.
now,
the
court
would
escape
--
i
mean,
the
government
would
escape
that
interpretation
by
two
suggestions.
first,
they
say
that
the
offense
of
remaining
is
a
continuous
offense
and
then
they
say
also
that
the
offense
comes
under
that
statute
that
provides
for
an
offense
that
starts
in
one
district
and
goes
into
another
or
occurs
in
more
than
one.
let's
take
them
up
one
at
a
time,
(a),
that
the
offense
of
remaining
is
a
continuous
crime.
now,
the
answer
to
that
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
government
is
that
criminal
violations
of
immigration
acts
have
never
been
regarded
as
continuing
crimes.
now,
our
brief
enumerates
a
number
of
cases
of
this
type.
a
man
comes
in
at
a
port
illegally.
he's
guilty
of
illegal
entry.
he
then
leaves
that
port
and
goes
to
one
other
place.
there's
an
interesting
case
where
a
party
comes
in
at
new
york.
he
is
later
apprehended
in
california.
now,
he
entered
illegally.
he
has
continued
to
remain
illegally
in
the
country
all
during
those
weeks
and
months.
he
is
apprehended
in
california
and
tried
there.
the
court
said
the
california
court
district
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
that
the
crime
was
committed
back
where
he
entered
in
new
york.
the
immigration
cases
annotated
are
replete
with
that
type
of
case.
there
has
been
a
definite
theory
of
law
growing
up
in
cases
similar
to
this
that
a
man
who
enters
illegally
and
who
continues
illegally
in
this
country
is
not
guilty
of
a
continuing
crime.
i
might
say
that
the
government
concedes
that
point
also.
they
do
not
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
well,
we
contend
that
in
theory
they're
the
same.
now,
i
might
draw
this
analogy,
see
if
this
helps,
your
honor.
this
man,
romualdo,
on
a
--
on
a
monday
is
in
a
certain
place,
he's
in
a
saloon.
he
has
a
friend
named
antonio
with
him
on
that
monday.
now,
romualdo
is
here
illegally
because
his
permit
expired
the
day
before
when
the
crime
was
committed.
he's
here
illegally.
now,
antonio,
his
friend,
sitting
with
him
on
monday
is
here
illegally
because
he
entered
yesterday,
sunday,
illegally.
we
don't
see
the
distinction
between
those
two
individual.
the
first
man
was
guilty
of
a
crime
by
remaining
here
illegally
and
he
started
the
crime,
as
justice
frankfurter
suggested,
at
the
--
at
the
time
of
that
affirmative
act.
the
other
man
came
in
yesterday
illegally.
they're
both
here.
now,
the
court
say,
the
man
who
entered
and
stays
here
is
not
guilty
of
a
continuing
crime.
we
say
merely
by
analogy,
the
man
who
overstays
his
leave
and
continuous
to
remain
here
is
not
guilty
of
a
continuing
crime.
now,
there
is
another
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
yes,
there
are.
there
are
--
there
are
two
exceptions.
i
will
treat
it
now,
that
your
honor
has
brought
it
up.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
oh,
all
right.
well
then
if
i
might,
i'll
reach
it
in
order.
thank
you.
now,
on
this
question
of
continuing,
i
just
like
to
leave
it
with
this
one
further
thought.
we
consider
the
basic
elementary
principle
that
ordinarily
when
a
man
is
charged
with
an
offense,
it
is
an
affirmative
act.
now,
if
the
congress
is
going
to
intend
that
a
crime
be
a
continuing
act
we
say
they
can
say
so,
they
can
tell
the
bar,
they
can
tell
this
court
if
they
so.
now,
they
have
in
some
instances
because
in
the
section
that's
been
referred
to
and
will
be
referred
to
later
that
is
section
3237,
that
section
that
covers
offenses
that
have
taken
place
in
different
districts.
in
the
second
paragraph
of
that
section,
the
congress
has
said,
“any
offense
involving
the
use
of
the
mails
or
transportation
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
is
a
continuing
offense.”
and
how
simple
it
would
have
been
in
this
instance
had
congress
intended
this
to
be
a
continuing
offense
for
the
congress,
too,
have
said,
“in
this
crime
of
remaining,
any
alien
crewmen
who
willfully
remains
in
the
united
states
in
excess
of
the
number
of
days
allowed
is
guilty
of
a
continuing
offense
and
shall
be
guilty
of
misdemeanor.
it
was
so
easy
for
them
to
say
the
fact
that
they
did
not,
that
they
refused
to
say
it,
although
the
discussions
came
up
indicates
very
clearly
to
us
that
they
did
not
--
that
intend
that
it
be
a
continuing
offense.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
it
--
it
is
not
printed
in
the
brief.
if,
your
honor
please,
on
page
33a
of
the
government's
brief
appears
the
first
paragraph
of
that
section.
and
that
we
--
i've
just
added
the
second
paragraph.
they
just
put
the
first
paragraph
in,
the
second
paragraph
was
--
was
not
included.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
no.
there
--
there
is
a
broad
general
type
of
discussion
that
is
referred
to
in
the
government
brief,
in
which
they
talk
about
the
number
of
seamen
who
come
in
and
who
are
remaining
here.
and
in
that
general
type
of
discussion,
there's
questions
of
venue
and
jurisdiction
referred
to.
i
don't
say
that
it
is
a
specific
subject
to
come.
next
point,
the
government
attempts
very
different
--
very
strenuously
to
bring
this
offense
in
under
section
3237.
that
is
the
section
that
we've
mentioned
about
that
refers
to
a
crime
that
starts
in
one
district
and
goes
into
another
district,
or
a
crime
that
is
committed
in
more
than
one
district.
we
--
we
say
that
this
does
not
--
this
type
of
offense
does
not
come
under
that
section.
it
does
not
begin
in
one
district
and
it
isn't
completed
in
another
district.
we
--
we
contend
that
it
does
not
exist
in
more
than
one
district.
we
say
it's
the
affirmative
act
of
this
man
staying.
at
the
expiration
of
his
permit,
the
offense
was
complete.
it
takes
no
other
act
by
him
or
by
anybody
else.
now,
under
this
section
3237
are
annotated
many
cases.
we've
gone
through
those.
they're
the
type
of
case
that
you
would
expect,
they're
conspiracy
cases.
they
are
cases
that
involved
using
the
mails
to
defraud.
there
are
ordinarily
a
number
of
persons
involved
in
it.
there
is
a
very
good
analysis
and
a
very
good
statement
of
what
this
section
means
and
the
type
of
case
it
refers
to.
it
appears
in
the
memorandum
that
the
court
below
wrote
in
a
similar
case
called
the
tavares
case.
and
in
construing
this
section
and
in
holding
below
that
this
section
did
not
cover
this
type
of
offense,
the
simple
offense
of
remaining.
the
court
below
said,
where
a
crime
consists
of
distinct
parts,
which
have
different
localities
or
where
it
may
be
said
there
is
a
continuously
moving
act,
commencing
with
the
offender.
and
hence,
ultimately
consummated
through
him
or
where
there's
a
confederation
in
purpose
between
two
or
more
persons,
that's
the
type
of
offense
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
section
3237.
we
submit
that
it
--
this
does
not
come
up.
now,
getting
to
the
point
that
justice
douglas
raised,
congress
in
the
immigration
act
provides
this
jurisdictional
section.
now,
they
say
that
there
are
two
offenses,
which
can
be
tried
in
the
district
where
the
defendant
is
apprehended
but
only
those
two.
the
section
says,
“these
defendants
shall
be
tried
where
the
offense
is
committed
with
the
exception,
however,
that
where
a
man
illegally
enters
he
may
be
tried
wherever
he
is
found.
exception
number
two,
if
a
man
has
been
deported
and
reenters,
he
may
be
tried
wherever
he
can
be
found
or
apprehended.”
those
are
the
only
two
exceptions.
now,
the
congress
had
the
right
at
the
time
when
enumerating
this
jurisdictional
section
to
say,
“yes,
we'll
include
the
crime
of
illegal
entry.
we'll
include
the
crime
of
entry
after
deportation
and
we
will
include
the
crime
of
section
1282,
which
is
the
crime
of
remaining
over
permit
time.”
they
did
not
do
it.
they
specifically
refrained
from
doing
it.
and
yet,
it
is
the
desire
of
the
government
in
this
case
that
this
court
write
that
in.
there
is
a
very
apt
and
appropriate
quote
from
a
case,
united
states
versus
johnson,
in
which
are
very
similar
question
came
up
in
323
u.s.,
it
had
to
do
with
enforcement
of
the
federal
denture
act.
and
in
that
case,
justice
frankfurter,
in
speaking
for
the
court
said,
“in
view
of
the
keen
awareness
of
enforcing
officials
as
well
as
that
of
the
members
of
the
committee
on
interstate
commerce
of
the
problems
raised
by
venue
in
criminal
trials,
it
is
inadmissible
to
suggest
either
oversight
on
the
part
of
congress
in
failing
to
make
provision
for
choice
of
venue
or
to
make
the
cavalier
assumption
that
that
which
is
specifically
provided
for
in
other
enactments,
that
is
trial
in
more
than
one
district,
was
authorized
but
through
parsimony
of
language
left
unexpressed.”
now,
we
say
that
in
this
instance,
the
congress
had
a
right
to
include
this
section.
speaking
of
parsimony
of
language,
they
needed
no
language
at
all.
they
needed
merely
the
figures
1282,
that's
all
the
congress
had
to
do,
was
add
this
section
to
the
two
exceptions.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
write
into
the
law
an
exception
which
the
congress
itself
chose
not
to
do.
counsel
makes
the
suggestion
that
in
this
type
of
case
where
a
man
has
remained
over
his
permit,
that
he
perhaps
should
be
tried
where
he
resides.
now,
that's
an
interesting
twist
to
the
case.
i'll
give
it
just
two
minutes.
and
--
and
they
state
that
in
the
beginning
on
page
6
of
the
government
brief,
they
say,
“so
that
an
alien
maybe
prosecuted
for
such
offense
wherever
he
is
living
at
the
time
prosecution
is
brought.”
then
again
on
12
they
reiterated
a
little
more
strongly
where
they
say
“the
venue
for
a
prosecution
of
an
alien
crewman
for
the
misdemeanor
of
willfully
remaining,
lies
in
any
judicial
district
where
he
is
found
residing
after
expiration
of
his
permit.”
they
say
it
again
on
page
18,
so
apparently,
that's
the
theory
with
which
they
started
out.
on
18,
the
offense
occurs
wherever
the
alien
deliberately
resides.
after
a
little
while,
i
submit,
the
--
the
cat
gets
out
of
the
bag
because
on
page
28
of
the
government
brief
we
find
--
i
don't
believe
that's
what
the
government
really
means.
because
on
page
28
they
say,
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph
on
28,
“it
would
have
been
redundant
to
insert
a
light
clause
in
regard
to
the
crime
of
remaining
because
as
an
inherently
continuing
act,
it
would
normally
occur
where
the
alien
was
apprehended.”
that's
what
apparently
they
want.
they
want
the
venue,
they
want
the
jurisdiction
to
lie
where
he
was
apprehended.
and
again,
their
concluding
sentence
shows
what
the
ultimate
underlying
motive
is.
we
submit
that
every
relevant
indication
of
congressional
intent
indicates
that
congress
meant
secretary
--
section
1282
(c)
to
describe
a
continuing
offense
and
that
venue
should
therefore
lie
wherever
that
offense
continues
to
be
committed,
that
is
wherever
the
alien
is
found.
now,
we
submit
that
it
finally
comes
out,
what
they
want
to
do
is
try
this
man,
cores,
and
other
similarly
situated
where
apprehended.
now,
that's
exactly
what
those
two
exceptions
are
to
the
general
jurisdiction,
where
apprehended.
that
is
the
man
who
comes
in
illegally,
the
man
who
comes
in
after
being
deported,
they
can
be
tried
where
apprehended,
but
they
now
want
to
try
this
fellow
where
apprehended,
although
the
congress
chose
not
to
make
any
such
exception
in
this
crime
of
remaining.
now,
someone
might
ask,
when
the
crime
of
remaining
could
have
been
so
simply
made
a
continuing
offense,
all
congress
had
to
do
as
we
mentioned
previously,
was
where
they
said
that
the
crime
of
remaining
is
a
misdemeanor,
they
could
have
said,
“and
shall
be
a
continuing
offense”.
when
they
so
easily
could
have
done
it,
why
did
not
congress
make
this
crime
of
remaining
a
continuing
offense?
i
believe
there
is
an
answer.
i
believe
because
they
were
concerned
about
the
abuses
that
would
result
from
making
this
a
continuing
offense.
one
has
already
been
suggested.
where
is
the
statute
of
limitations?
apparently,
there
is
none
that
could
very
well
be
infused.
and
i
say
that
the
type
of
abuse
that
could
come
under
this
theory
of
continuing
offense,
curiously
enough
is
dramatically
illustrated
in
the
government's
own
brief.
on
page
19
of
the
government's
own
brief,
appears
this
statement
at
the
top.
and
let
me
read
it
and
then
let
me
suggest
the
significance
of
it,
“in
this
case,
the
information,
which
we'll
refer
to
shortly,
permitted
proof
that
appellee
was
willfully
remaining
in
the
united
states
beyond
the
specified
period
when
he
went
to
connecticut,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
residing
there
at
the
instant
his
permit
expired.”
now,
look
where
that
leads
us.
as
we
look
at
the
record
we
find
that
on
page
2
is
the
information
and
it
says,
“on
or
about
may
26,
1955
at
bethel,
connecticut
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
cores
did
commit
an
offense.”
now,
they
say
that
under
that
information,
they
can
introduce
proof
of
the
offense.
now,
the
offense
as
shown
here,
that
you'll
see
also
in
the
record
is,
he
was
in
connecticut
in
may
of
1957,
two
years
later.
and
yet
they
say
under
our
theory
of
continuing
offense,
we
can
charge
a
man
in
an
information
with
an
offense
on
may
26,
1955,
he
can
prepare
himself
to
answer
that
defense
and
yet,
we
can
come
into
court
and
show
that
he
committed
offense
in
may
1957
and
we
can
hold
him
guilty.
now,
we
say
that
congress
never
intended
anything
like
that.
we
say
further
that
we
cannot
believe
that
this
court
could
put
its
stamp
of
approval
on
any
such
construction.
and
i
believe
it
shows
very
clearly
why
the
congress
did
not
choose
to
enlarge
this
into
a
continuing
offense.
as
amicus,
i
believe
i
have
one
other
responsibility.
that
is
to
protect
this
man's
rights
under
the
record
that
exist
here
and
i
submit
to
you
a
curious
situation
exists.
it's
a
very
short
record.
as
i
looked
at
it,
as
i
read
it,
as
i
studied
it,
i
couldn't
get
over
the
uneasy
feeling
that
there
was
something
wrong
about
it.
finally,
if
the
court
will
excuse
me,
i
concluded
there's
something
fishy
about
it,
and
i
--
and
i
believe
there
is.
as
you
look
at
the
colloquy
between
counsel
here,
for
instance,
it
took
place.
apparently,
this
defendant,
cores,
was
represented,
in
big
print
it
says,
“for
the
defendant”.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
but
in
--
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
page
3,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
clark
m.
clifford
page
3
of
the
record.
thank
you.
in
this
colloquy
that
took
place
which
look,
i
must
say
very
curious
to
me,
it
seemed
to
--
it
didn't
seem
as
though
it
started
at
the
beginning
but
that's
all
that
came
up.
but
here,
there's
a
colloquy
between
judge
and
counsel
but
the
counsel
is
a
government
counsel.
there's
no
time
do
i
see
the
defendant's
counsel
saying
anything.
and
yet,
the
queerest
thing
about
it
is
that
this
man
is
charged
with
an
offense
in
may
of
1955,
he
knows
that
he's
not
guilty
of
that
offense
because
the
government's
attorney
says
he
was
in
new
york
for
a
year
before
coming
to
connecticut.
and
yet
when
this
man
is
charged
with
an
offense
in
may
of
1955
for
which
he
knows
he's
not
guilty,
there's
a
record
in
here
as
though
at
one
time
he
tried
to
plead
guilty.
now,
i
don't
know
what
was
going
on
down
below,
but
it
made
me
very
uneasy.
i
don't
know
where
his
counsel
was.
i
don't
know
why
there
should
be
any
such
suggestion
because
he
had
a
complete
defense,
not
only
did
he
not
commit
the
crime
charged
in
the
--
in
the
information
but
just
one
month
before
this
case
came
up
for
hearing,
was
this
tavares
case,
in
which
the
court
wrote
a
memorandum
and
said
he
had
no
jurisdiction.
and
yet
that's
not
raised
in
behalf
of
the
defendant.
the
only
thing
that
saved
this
defendant
below
was
a
conscientious
district
judge,
named
judge
smith,
who
had
to
bring
the
matter
up.
now,
the
importance
of
that
is
this,
in
addition
to
the
construction
of
the
statute,
which
appears
to
us,
clearly
means
that
this
is
not
a
continuing
crime.
there
is
another
reason
why
the
verdict
below
of
dismissal
should
be
affirmed.
i
say
that
it
should
be
affirmed
aside
from
the
other
consideration
on
this
record
alone,
because
on
page
2
of
the
record,
we
see
that
this
man
is
charged
with
an
offense
on
may
26,
1955.
over
on
page
3
in
the
first
sentence,
the
government
attorney
says,
“i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention,
he
stayed
in
new
york
for
about
a
year
before
coming
to
connecticut.”
i
submit
what
could
the
court
do
and
do
otherwise?
a
man
is
charged
with
an
offense
on
may
26,
1955,
the
government's
own
proof
through
statement
of
counsel
is
that
he
did
not
come
to
connecticut
for
at
least
a
year
thereafter.
i
think
the
judge
said,
“i
was
given
jurisdiction
by
the
charge
in
the
information,
you
have
disproved
it
to
me,
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
dismiss.”
amicus
submits
that
under
two
theories,
both
the
first
one
on
the
construction
of
the
statute,
the
second
one,
because
the
record
itself
shows
lack
of
jurisdiction,
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honor.
