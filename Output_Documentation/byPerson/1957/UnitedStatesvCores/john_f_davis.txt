mr.
john
f.
davis
if
this
court
wish
me
to
proceed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
a
criminal
information,
charging
an
alien
seaman
with
remaining
in
the
united
states
for
a
period
in
excess
of
the
number
of
days
permitted
by
his
landing
permit.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
information
on
the
ground
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
because
the
suit
was
commenced
it
thought
in
the
long
--
in
the
wrong
district.
the
appellee
was
an
alien
crewman
from
a
ship
which
put
in
at
philadelphia.
he
was
given
a
landing
permit
which
allowed
him
to
remain
in
the
united
states
for
the
period
the
ship
was
in
philadelphia
of
not
more
than
29
days.
instead
of
sailing
with
the
ship,
he
went
on
to
new
york,
where
he
stayed
for
about
a
year
and
then
he
went
to
connecticut,
where
he
was
residing
at
the
time
he
was
apprehending
--
apprehended
and
this
proceeding
was
commenced.
this
proceeding
was
commenced
in
connecticut,
where
he
was
residing
when
he
was
apprehended.
the
district
judge
held
that
if
--
if
this
man
had
committed
an
offense,
it
was
completed
when
the
ship
sails
and
that
it
was
a
single
offense,
which
was
done
at
that
time
and
therefore,
he
was
not
in
violation
of
the
law
while
he
was
residing
in
connecticut.
and
for
this
reason,
it
dismissed
the
information.
the
government
brings
the
case
here
under
the
criminal
appeals
act.
section
3237
of
the
criminal
code
provides
that
any
offense
committed
in
more
than
one
district
may
be
inquired
off
and
prosecuted
in
any
district
in
which
the
offense
was
committed.
and
so
the
simple
question
here
is
whether
the
offense
with
which
this
appellee
was
charged
was
a
continuing
offense,
which
was
in
the
process
of
being
committed
when
he
lived
in
connecticut,
whether
it
was
a
non-continuing
offense
which
was
completed
when
the
ship
sailed.
first,
i
think
we
should
look
at
the
definition
of
the
offense
as
it
contained
--
as
it
is
contained
in
the
statute.
that
is
printed
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
it
reads,
“any
alien
seaman
--
any
alien
crewman
who
wilfully
remains
in
the
united
states
in
excess
of
the
number
of
days
allowed
in
any
conditional
permit
issued
under
subsection
(a)
of
this
section,
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.”
the
important
words
from
our
point
of
view
were,
“any
alien
crewman
who
willfully
remains
in
the
united
states
in
excess
of
the
number
of
days
allowed”.
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
there
are
three
geographic
localities
where
it
is
possible
that
someone
might
claim
that
there
was
venue.
first
is
philadelphia,
the
city
where
the
vessel
put
in
and
from
which
it
sailed.
it
would
really
make
little
sense
to
require
trial
to
be
held
in
philadelphia
because
the
seaman
is
not
in
fact
required
to
sail
from
philadelphia
by
the
law.
as
long
as
he
--
the
law
reads,
for
the
period
permitted
by
the
--
by
the
permit,
as
long
as
he
leaves
the
united
states
within
that
period
of
time,
whether
he
leaves
from
philadelphia
or
somewhere
else,
he
is
not
in
violation
of
the
law
.in
fact,
many
landing
permits
contemplate
that
the
seaman
will
leave
from
another
port
on
another
vessel
and
many
of
the
landing
permits
therefore
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
original
--
the
original
port
of
entry.
now,
the
second
locality,
where
venue
might
be
asserted
is
the
place
where
the
crewman
was
physically
at
the
time
the
permit
expired.
this
of
course
depends
in
part
on
chance.
he
might
in
fact
be
in
--
in
transit
from
one
place
to
another
at
the
time
--
the
moment
the
permit
expired.
and
if
the
permit
were
--
the
length
of
the
permit
were
measured
by
the
time
that
the
vessel
remained
in
port,
he
might
not
even
know
of
this
precise
time
that
the
vessel
departed
and
therefore,
he
would
not
know
at
what
time
he
was
actually
violating
the
law.
now,
the
third
possible
place
to
pick
the
venue
is
the
place
or
the
places
where
the
--
where
the
alien
crewman
resides
--
remains
after
the
period
of
time
which
it
permitted
by
his
landing
permit.
we
believe
that
establishing
venue
in
this
place
coincides
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
it
coincides
with
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
is
involved
and
that
imposes
no
hardship
on
the
--
on
the
alien
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
he
were
a
commuter,
he
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
--
on
our
--
on
my
theory,
it
would
be
a
question
whether
he
was
remaining
in
those
two
places
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
that
is
true.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
--
i
think
it's
domicile,
but
i
think
also
he
would
be
remaining
in
new
york
if
he
worked
there.
i
don't
mean
to
use
residence
in
any
two
technical
term.
i
mean,
he
must
willfully
be
staying
in
a
place
and
rather
than
merely
passing
through
it.
i
say
this
--
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
language
of
the
statute
as
i
pointed
out
a
minute
ago
is
that
he
willfully
remains
in
the
united
states
in
excess
of
the
number
of
days
allowed.
it
does
not
say
that
the
alien
must
leave
at
or
before
the
termination
of
his
--
of
his
permit.
it
uses
the
word
remain
and
that
word
in
itself
has
a
--
has
a
sense
of
continuation.
it
can
be
defined
as,
if
he
continued
to
stay
in
the
united
states.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
on
the
language,
just
purely
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
this
man
was
remaining
in
the
united
states
at
the
time
he
was
apprehended
in
connecticut.
now,
as
to
the
nature
of
the
offense,
here,
there
is
no
objection
to
the
alien's
entry.
there
was
nothing
illegal
about
it.
he
has
committed
no
crime
outside
of
remaining
since
he
has
come
to
this
country,
forfeiting
his
right
to
stay.
we
have
--
there
is
no
discovery
of
any
disloyalty,
no
association
of
his
past,
which
makes
him
ineligible
to
remain
in
this
country.
instead,
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
congress
was
--
was
getting
at
in
this
case
was
an
alien
who
stayed,
who
remained
in
the
country
longer
than
he
was
permitted
to,
remained
by
the
--
by
the
immigration
law.
this
law
was
passed
by
congress
after
an
investigation,
in
which
it
was
determined
that
every
year,
thousands
of
alien
seamen
were
attempting
to
loose
themselves
in
the
population
of
the
united
states
and
obtain
a
right
to
stay
here
by
--
not
a
right
to
stay
here
but
obtaining
the
actual
staying
here
by
losing
themselves
in
the
--
in
the
general
population.
congress
wasn't
concerned
really
with
a
man
who
overstayed
his
leave
by
days,
hours,
or
minutes.
it
was
concerned
with
seamen
who
were
using
their
entry
into
the
united
states
as
seamen
as
a
method
of
acquiring
illegal
residence
here
and
therefore,
i
say
that
the
very
nature
of
the
crime,
which
congress
was
attacking
was
that
very
thing
which
this
appellee
was
doing
in
connecticut
at
the
time
he
was
apprehended.
now,
since
the
constitutional
provisions
on
--
on
venue,
without
a
doubt
intended
to
protect
defendants
from
the
hardships
of
being
tried
in
places
where
they
are
not
properly
able
to
defend
themselves.
it
--
it
is
appropriate
that
in
considering
the
construction
of
this
statute,
we
should
consider
it
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
provisions
that
say
a
man
shall
be
tried
in
the
--
in
the
district
where
the
crime
takes
place.
and
we
should
consider
whether
or
not
the
construction,
which
i
suggest
is
one
which
will
constitute
the
kind
of
hardship
which
the
constitution
was
attempting
to
--
to
eliminate.
well,
in
this
case,
as
i
say,
there
were
three
places
where
he
could
be
tried
and
this
case
might
be
taken
as
more
or
less
characteristic
of
this
case.
he
could
have
been
tried
in
philadelphia
of
--
that's
one
possibility
as
to
where
a
venue
could
be
asserted.
that
certainly
would
not
be
a
place
which
would
be
--
which
we
have
any
reason
to
believe
--
to
believe
would
be
convenient
to
the
seaman.
so
far
as
we
would
know,
he
hasn't
been
in
--
in
philadelphia
since
the
day
he
landed
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
country.
and
similarly
with
new
york,
he
stayed
in
new
york
and
presumably,
may
well
have
been
there
at
the
time
when
--
when
the
ship
sailed,
when
his
permit
expired.
but
so
far
as
we
know,
he
has
no
connections
there
and
it
would
have
been
--
it
would
be
equally
difficult
for
him
to
defend
himself
in
new
york.
on
the
other
hand,
connecticut
is
the
place
of
his
residence
and
it
is
therefore
more
consistent
with
the
--
with
the
constitutional
provisions
that
he
should
be
tried
in
--
in
connecticut.
the
disadvantage
which
the
--
which
the
alien
suffers
from
our
construction
is
that
if
it
is
a
continuing
crime,
it
may
be
that
he
could
be
tried
in
more
than
one
district.
and
therefore,
we
are
faced
with
the
question
whether
he
would
suffer
a
hardship
because
the
department
of
justice
would
be
in
a
position
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
various
districts
to
determine
which
--
in
which
district
to
bring
suit
against
him.
and
with
--
in
regard
to
this
--
this
matter,
i
may
say
that
the
present
criminal
code
--
code
of
criminal
procedure
gives
him
protection
because
when
there
is
a
crime
which
takes
place
in
more
than
one
district,
the
department
of
justice
no
longer
has
the
--
has
the
right
to
choose
the
district.
the
judge
--
the
district
court
in
which
the
case
is
brought,
has
discretion
to
remove
the
case
to
any
other
district
where
the
crime
--
where
the
crime
equally
occurred
in
order
that
justice
may
be
done
and
therefore,
the
matter
is
left
in
the
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
court
itself.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
appears
in
the
--
in
the
quote.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
--
this
provision
of
which
i
read?
i
think
it
came
in
with
the
adoption
of
the
present
court
criminal
procedure.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it's
been
there
for
some
time.
i
have
to
check
on
it.
but
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
is
a
continuing
offense
then
the
problem
is
when
would
the
statute
of
limitations
run?
would
it
run
and
if
it
continues
--
well,
it
might
be
argued,
it
may
well
be
argued
if
it
is
a
continuing
offense
that
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
run.
that
as
long
as
he
continues
to
remain
in
the
united
states,
he
is
--
he
is
subject
to
prosecution.
i
do
not
think
that
necessarily
follows,
however,
from
my
argument
as
to
venue.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
there
was
no
--
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
necessarily
run
forever.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
i
think
it
probably
would,
but
i
think
that
it
is
not
certain
that
it
would
and
let
me
explain
what
i
mean.
under
the
--
under
the
immigration
act
for
example,
with
respect
to
illegal
entry,
there
is
a
special
provision
saying
that
when
an
alien
is
apprehended,
he
may
be
tried
in
the
place
of
apprehension
rather
than
going
back
to
the
place
of
entry.
but
there's
no
question
with
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
case
of
illegal
entry
as
such
will
run
from
the
place
--
from
the
time
of
entry
rather
than
from
the
time
of
apprehension
or
the
time
he
remains
in
the
country.
now,
i
suggest
that
it
is
possible,
if
there
is
concern
about
the
continuation
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
it
is
possible
that
under
the
immigration
act,
one
could
say
that
congress
has
shown
an
intent
that
--
to
distinguish
between
questions
of
venue
and
questions
of
the
time
of
the
running
into
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
the
court
could
say
in
the
light
of
the
immigration
act
then,
this
provision
has
entry
that
congress
may
well
have
intended
--
could
have
intended
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
run
from
the
time
that
his
permit
expired.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
is
true.
now,
i
--
i
am
not
urging
them.
i'm
certainly
not
trying
to
give
away
a
future
government
case
if
there
is
one
with
respect
to
statute
of
limitations
in
case
of
--
in
case
it
should
arise
in
this
continuing
offense.
there
are
many
continuing
offenses
where
the
statute
of
limitations,
of
course,
does
not
run
as
long
as
the
illegal
activity
is
continued.
conspiracy
of
course
is
--
is
an
example,
which
this
court
has
recorded
all
the
time.
failure
to
register
under
the
--
under
the
alien
registration
act
is
another
case.
failure
--
failure
to
register
under
the
selective
service
act
is
another
case.
and
so,
that
there
is
a
general
theory
of
law
that
one
doesn't
get
a
right
to
violate
the
law
by
violating
it.
there
is
no
prescription
runs
and
as
long
as
he
continues
to
--
to
violate
the
statute
will
not
run.
that
question
is
not
before
the
court.
and
i
merely
suggest
that
it
doesn't
follow
necessarily
from
the
argument
which
i
am
making
here
on
venue.
now,
the
court
below
found
some
support
for
its
position
that
this
was
a
non-continuing
crime.
on
the
--
on
another
provision
of
the
statute
dealing
with
entry
and
reentry
after
--
after
an
alien
had
been
deported,
there
is
a
specific
provision,
section
1329
of
the
--
of
the
immigration
act,
which
says,
“that
in
those
cases
of
illegal
entry
and
reentry,
the
alien
maybe
prosecuted
at
the
place
where
he
is
apprehended.”
and
the
court
said,
congress
has
dealt
specifically
with
these
problems
and
made
the
provision
and
put
venue
in
them
and
by
leaving
out
a
provision
with
respect
to
overstaying
the
leave,
it
must
have
intended
a
different
result.
i
submit
the
difference
in
treatment
by
congress
is
not
dependent
upon
an
intent
to
have
a
different
result,
rather,
it
is
dependent
upon
the
fact
that
the
crimes
of
illegal
entry
and
reentry
are
by
nature
specific
terminable
acts.
and
that
if
congress
had
intended
them
--
intended
to
give
a
right
to
the
government
to
prosecute
it,
where
the
alien
was
apprehended,
it
was
necessary
to
make
this
specific
provision.
and
in
fact
that
by
making
this
provision,
it
probably
supports
our
position
because
it
would
be
illogical
to
permit
aliens
who
have
been
entered
illegally
or
reentered
illegally
to
be
prosecuted
where
they're
apprehended
and
not
to
permit
a
seaman
in
the
situation
which
we
have.
therefore
in
summary,
i
--
i
suggest
that
this
--
this
offense
both
by
its
nature,
by
definition
in
the
statute,
and
by
its
consideration
and
inconsideration
of
the
rights
of
the
alien
involved,
may
well
should
be
held
to
be
a
continuing
offense
and
that
venues
should
be
placed
in
connecticut.
i
will
reserve,
if
i
may,
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
if
i
understood
mr.
clifford's
argument
correctly,
at
one
stage
he
suggested
to
the
court
that
in
the
case
of
continuing
crime
offenses,
venue
should
be
fixed
by
the
beginning
of
the
crime
rather
than
where
it
continues.
in
that
regard,
i
may
say
that
congress
has
acted
not
in
this
statute
but
in
the
--
generally
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
code.
it
acted
after
the
decision
in
the
johnson
case,
where
this
court
said
that
if
the
court
--
if
congress
meant
these
offenses
to
be
prosecuted
in
more
than
one
place
it
should
say
so.
congress
then
proceeded
in
18
u.s.c.
3237
to
say
precisely
that,
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
continuing
crime,
the
defendant
may
be
prosecuted
in
any
place
where
that
crime
takes
place.
and
therefore,
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
was
no
necessity
when
congress
had
defined
a
crime
as
a
continuing
one
as
it
is
our
contention
it
did
in
the
immigration
act,
no
necessity
for
making
a
special
venue
provision.
i
would
like
to
refer
also
to
this
discreancy
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
information.
the
criminal
information
as
it
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
this
record
is
defective.
the
united
states
attorney
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
--
and
told
the
court
that
actually,
the
man
was
not
in
bethel,
connecticut
on
may
26,
1955
but
that
he
came
there
two
years
later.
and
so,
this
would
be
a
situation
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
amend
the
information
to
conform
with
the
facts
in
order
to
--
before
the
--
before
the
proceeding
would
be
completed.
rule
7
(e)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provides
specifically
for
amending
information
to
conform
to
the
facts
as
they
existed.
now
of
course,
if
that
resulted
in
a
hardship
on
the
alien,
if
that
did
prevent
him
from
making
his
defense,
the
court
should
not
exercise
its
discretion
to
permit
that
amendment.
the
court
didn't
go
into
that.
appellate
dismissed
the
complaint
entirely
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
venue
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
general
statute
of
limitations
of
five
years
would
apply
to
this,
the
general
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
it
would
--
i
--
i
believe
it
would
run
from
the
last
date
that
he
continued
to
remain
illegally
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
would.
i
--
i
say
i
believe
that.
i
do
not
believe
it's
inevitable
if
that
is
the
result
because
as
i
suggested
earlier,
in
the
light
of
the
--
of
title
8,
they
do
separate
venue
and
statute
of
limitations
for
the
purposes
of
entry
and
reentry.
and
i
believe
that
if
it
were
felt
that
that
was
inappropriate
construction,
that
they
could
separate
venue
and
statute
of
limitations
for
this
case
also.
