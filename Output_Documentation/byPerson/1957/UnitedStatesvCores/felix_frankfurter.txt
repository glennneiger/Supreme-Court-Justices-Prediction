justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
that
--
when
did
that
come
in
to
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
way
back
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
other
way
around.
the
fact
that
you
fix
venue
at
one
place
doesn't
make
it
a
non-continuing
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
he
seems
to
be
willfully
remaining
on
the
31st
day
by
the
time
he
goes
to
another
city?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
congress
has
expressed
the
specific
words
what
the
crime
was,
words
of,
“willfully
remains.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
why
with
full
knowledge
that
he
has
no
right
to
remain.
his
lawyer
advised
him
on
his
31st
day
in
new
york
(inaudible)
willfully
to
remain,
does
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
next
day,
for
one
reason
or
another,
he
moved
to
philadelphia.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
is
the
theory
by
which
on
a
fair
construction
of
a
criminal
statute
or
a
lenient
construction
if
he
seizes
willfully
to
remain
in
philadelphia
against
the
law.
he
remained
there
in
violation
of
the
law,
but
you
say
it
isn't
a
willfully
remain
in
there,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
he
begins
to
willfully
remain,
the
beginning
is
the
exhaustion
of
what
congress
has
condemned,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it's
exhaustion
in
every
way,
the
statute
of
limitation
runs
from
that
moment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
that
is
your
--
the
statute
of
limitation
runs,
the
venue
is
determined,
those
two
(inaudible)
criminal
prosecution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
would
be
after
he
left
the
united
states.
