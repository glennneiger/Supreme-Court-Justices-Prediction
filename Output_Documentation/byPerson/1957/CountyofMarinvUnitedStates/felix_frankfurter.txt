frankfurter
where
--
i'm
sorry
i
miss
something.
where
was
this
motion
to
amend
(inaudible)
something
to
make?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
this?
this
amendment
was
to
one
end?
this
is
in
the
district
court,
i
believe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
commission
had
acted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
issue
contested
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
complaint
--
in
the
complaint
in
which
you
challenged
the
order,
no
objection
was
made
to
that
aspect
of
the
order
and
in
the
district
court,
we
tried
to
amend
the
basis
of
--
for
the
extent
and
scope
or
the
nature
of
the
issues
which
you
challenged,
is
that
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
in
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you
fall
into
this,
may
i
ask
this?
at
the
labor
union,
for
them
--
do
they
--
had
they
been
before
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
plaintiffs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
--
and
they
raised
the
public
interest
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
although
they
had
objected
to
the
report
and
the
determination
of
the
commission,
they
did
not
in
court
aline
on
your
side
objects
to
raise
the
public
interest
question,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
didn't
raise
the
public
interest
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
after
they
dismiss
that
the
commission
having
gone
partly
on
the
ground
of
its
desirability,
as
i
understand
from
you,
of
having
two
separate
unions
for
bargaining
purposes.
the
union
itself
in
its
answer
did
not
raise
that
question
but
then,
you
keep
it
up
after
they
dropped
that
although
they
have
made
no
objection,
is
that
right?
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
going
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
drawing
any
inference.
i
just
want
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
this
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
you
--
you
then
made
the
point
not
because
they
have
made
them,
there
--
it
was
no
longer
there
to
raise
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
this
is
new
evidence
that
hadn't
been
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
provision
of
the
statute,
if
any,
which
(inaudible)
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
hear
new
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wanted
the
case
to
go
back
to
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
basis
of
the
new
evidence
facing
for
it.
you
wanted
--
you
want
the
district
court's
dissent
not
to
decide
any
of
the
issues
presented
back
to
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
is
--
the
commission
denied
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
very
good
reason?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
the
case
was
closed
before
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
how
long
had
the
case
been
before
the
commission
(inaudible)
been
before
the
examiner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
--
in
your
petition
for
reopening
the
case,
did
you
lay
the
ground
that
this
is
a
newly
discovered
evidence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
not
capable
of
having
been
produced
during
all
this
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
makes
--
why
would
this
--
why
was
it
not
available
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
later
testimony
of
his
was
not
capable
of
having
been
carried
it
out
by
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
this
was
expert
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rather
available
figures.
well,
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
time
period
was
the
same
and
the
conditions
were
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
same
operation.
they
may
well
be
in
this
case
of
fluctuating
prices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
ratios
and
not
amount?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
despite
--
well,
despite
present
cross-examined
before
your
state
commission
regarding
his
contradictory
and
so
forth
on
your
place,
contradicted
testimony
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
your
commission
have
the
--
his
testimony
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that
would
be
more
confounded
now.
you
were
before
the
commission,
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
heard
his
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
knew
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
cross-examine
him
before
your
state
commission
regarding
his
contradiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
then,
why
shouldn't
--
why
should
the
i.c.c.
a
part
of
the
contradiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
it
was
so
obvious
that
you
didn't
make
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
should
think
the
reliability
of
a
witness
is
an
issue
--
is
--
is
issue
that
goes
to
the
value
of
the
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
a
fact
that
you
did
not
make
use
of
his
prior
different
testimony
on
the
same
portion,
but
you're
not
willing
to
say
important,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
it
wasn't
relevant
for
you
to
cross-examine
him
on
his
inconsistency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
deem
it's
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
happened
to
decide
whether
the
commission
was
within
its
discretionary
power
in
not
opening
the
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
the
question
before
it
was,
whether
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
and
not
reopen
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
the
question
here
whether
the
district
court
allowably
said
that
that
wasn't
exercise,
not
an
abuse
of
discretion,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
question,
on
this
issue,
what
was
the
difference
between
the
act
of
1920
about
which
justice
brennan
asked
you
and
the
transportation
act
of
1940?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
in
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
regard
to
the
actual
content
of
what
is
now
section
5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
as
you
said
it
was
a
supplanting
of
the
provisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
19
--
in
1920
act,
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
this
both
case,
it
both
authorized
--
made
provision
for
authorization,
consolidation
and
mergers
and
also
directed
the
commission
to
make
a
comprehensive
plan
to
unify
the
railroad
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
he
sure
is
paying
and
therefore,
that
was
cut
out
in
the
1940
amendment.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
were
the
changes,
the
subsequent
changes
between
the
authorizations
of
the
1920
and
1940
acts
in
relating
to
the
same
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
cut
--
cut
the
first
cutout.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
a
railroad,
these
are
motor
carriers,
a
railroad
couldn't
divest
itself
as
part
of
its
system,
could
it,
without
permission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
provision
was
there
to
allow
divestiture,
a
part
of
a
railroad
system
by
transferring
it
to
some
other
railroads?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
that
extent,
there
was
a
split
off
provided
for
or
authorized
by
the
act.
if
you're
going
to
use
word
like
“split
off,”
there
was
a
split
off,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whenever
there
was
a
divestment
of
a
system
of
railroads
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
its
activities,
there's
a
split
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
suggest
to
it
--
i
suppose
you
would
say
in
that
case
there
is
a
--
a
merger
of
the
really
acquiring
road
into
divesting
road.
that's
--
that's
the
difference,
isn't
it?
but
here,
there's
--
there's
an
internal
separation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
--
here,
you
have
to
get
somebody's
permission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
conclusion
of
your
contention
that
if
a
railroad
or
motor
enterprise
would
like
to
cut-off
a
non-paid
aspect,
it
cannot
so
rid
itself
of
a
vesting
asset
unless
it
is
able
to
transfer
to
an
existing
parent.
is
that
your
--
that's
what
it
get
down
to
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
it's
about
the
commission
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
court
has
rendered
some
decisions
that
i
respect,
but
i
don't
agree
with
it
at
the
time
which
made
also
to
(inaudible)
on
requirement
of
state
approval.
i'm
thinking
of
schwabacher
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
--
that's
schwabacher
but
i'm
--
i'm
indicating
the
attitude
of
this
court
for
all
those
problems,
the
state-interstate
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
was
closer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
pretty
far
away
so
far
as
i'm
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we've
got
--
those
are
really
different
problems.
that's
the
question
on
the
floor
when
you
display
a
conceded
state
rate.
all
right.
all
i'm
saying
is,
if
you
say
that's
the
closest,
then
we've
got
to
make
new
law
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
there's
a
separate
argument
on
this
after
the
main
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
of
insufficiency
of
evidence
isn't
--
isn't
now
being
urged.it's
not
here,
is
it?
but
there
is
no
basis
in
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
in
the
questions
--
that
is
not
as
ever
a
specific
issue
here,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
(inaudible)
in
my
question.
i
look
at
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
is
not
presented
as
it's
--
you
said
there
are
two
questions
were
raised
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
there's
no
basis
in
evidence
of
what
the
commission
did.
and
two,
the
case
should
be
sent
back
to
the
commission
for
further
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
matter
is
being
urged
that
(inaudible)
is
being
urged
that
the
formal,
the
insufficiency
of
this
none
adequacy
of
the
evidence
is
not
here
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
think
that
was
so
relevant
to
this
problem
immediately
after
the
labor
union
pulled
out
of
the
litigation?
why
is
that
relevant
and
say
you
haven't
urge
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i
don't
see
how
the
withdrawal
by
the
union
of
their
position
in
the
litigation
exposed
the
sham.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
suppose
the
sham?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
agreement
showed
to
me
that
the
union
made
a
kind
of
arrangement
that
was
satisfactory
to
do
them.
that's
all
it
shows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
the
situation
throughout
this
litigation
from
the
time
you
filed
your
complaint
in
october.
i'm
not
saying
you
are
wrong
but
i
don't
see
that
--
that
your
justification
doesn't
seem
to
hitch
with
the
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
were
subject
to
such
a
private
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
two
corporations
all
through
this
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
intervening
event
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
commission's
action.
it
had
to
do
with
the
pursuit
of
self-interest
by
the
labor
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
imposition
on
the
time
of
the
court
but
to
take
to
that
to
go
back,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
