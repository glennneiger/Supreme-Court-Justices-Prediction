mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
to
discuss
the
facts
relating
to
the
posture
of
this
case,
what
has
been
properly
before
the
district
court
and
what
we
believe
is
properly
before
this
court.
now,
the
court
proceeding
began
on
october
1955
and
these
appellants
filed
their
complaint
and
it's
in
the
record
of
pages
1
to
7.
and
on
that
complaint,
they
attacked
the
commission's
orders
solely
on
a
single
ground
that
transactions
of
this
type,
split-up
as
they
call
it,
are
not
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
under
section
5.
nothing
was
said
in
there
about
the
rate,
policies
to
california
commission,
nothing
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
commission's
findings,
their
support
on
the
evidence
or
anything
else.
simply,
the
question
of
whether
this
type
of
transaction
is
covered
by
section
5.
as
the
appellants
have
stated,
thereafter
both
the
appellants
and
the
defendants,
united
states
and
interstate
commerce
commission
filed
motions
for
judgment
in
the
pleadings.
it
was
perfectly
clear
what
everybody
was
doing.
the
appellants
stated
in
their
own
motion
that
they
so
moved
for
the
reason
that
the
pleadings
of
the
various
parties
showed
that
there
is
no
question
of
fact
involved
in
the
case
and
that
the
sole
question
recited
is
one
of
law.
plaintiffs
did
not
file
to
the
district
court
the
record
of
the
evidence
received
before
the
commission.
that
evidence
is
not
before
this
court.
then,
the
case
went
to
argument
before
the
three
judges.
and
it
was
only
in
the
course
of
the
oral
argument
before
three
federal
judges.
now,
for
the
first
time,
we'd
heard
about
this
proposal
to
amend
the
complaint
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
the
appellant's
counsel
stated
that
he
intended,
"to,"
and
i
quote,
"to
ask
leave
of
the
court
in
the
event
the
determination
of
the
court
should
be
against
us
on
the
legal
question
raised
to
give
us
permission
to
amend
the
complaint,
to
set
forth
as
an
additional
ground
the
challenge
of
the
finding
of
the
commission
that
the
order
in
question
is
consistent
with
the
public
interest".
and
not
even
at
that
point,
if
may
i
point
out,
not
even
at
that
point
did
he
say
anything
about
challenging
the
commission's
action
in
refusing
to
reopen
the
case
for
rehearing
and
reconsideration.
and
it
was
not
until
february
28,
five
days
after
the
oral
argument
before
the
three-judge
court
that
these
appellants
filed
their
motion
for
leave
to
amend
their
complaint.
the
district
court
heard
argument
on
this
motion.
then
on
april
12,
1957,
the
three-judge
court
handed
down
its
decision.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
in
april
1956.
the
three-judge
court
called
us
out
to
--
to
argue
on
whether
the
motion
to
amend
should
be
granted.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
want
to
make
an
erroneous
statement
here,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
gave
very
much
of
a
response.
i
would
like
to
check
that
in
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
i'm
in
error,
i
would
like
to
saw
it
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
we
contend
that
the
district
court
did
not
err
in
denying
this
motion.
because
this
motion,
for
the
first
time,
asked
leave
to
amend
the
complaint
in
two
major
respects,
first,
to
allege
that
the
commission's
order
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
second,
that
the
commission's
action
in
--
in
denying
the
--
the
appellant's
petition
for
reconsideration
involved
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
commission.
that
--
it's
admitted,
has
been
from
the
beginning,
that
this
was
not
due
to
any
inadvertence
or
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
appellants.
it
was
a
deliberate
tactical
choice.
they,
themselves,
state
it
with
candor.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
you've
heard
quite
a
bit
of
argument
on
that
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
nor
i
in
my
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct,
sir.
but
i
make
this
very
clear
that
the
original
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court
made
no
attack
on
the
commission's
action
in
refusing
to
reopen
the
proceeding.
that
issue
too,
like
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
was
raised
only
in
this
motion
to
amend
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
filed
after
the
argument
before
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
right,
sir.
correct,
sir.
now,
the
appellants
based
their
argument
on
rule
15
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
provides
that
after
issue
has
been
joined,
a
party
may
amend
this
proceeding
only
by
leave
of
court
or
by
written
consent
of
the
adverse
party
and
leave
shall
be
grant
--
given
freely
when
justice
so
requires.
but
we
submit
that
rule
15
is
directed
largely,
primarily
at
the
amendment
of
pleadings
in
connection
with
judicial
trials.
every
one
of
the
--
of
the
cases,
cited
by
the
appellants
on
this
point,
relates
the
amendment
of
pleadings
in
cases
tried
by
the
courts.
we
are
concerned,
as
we
see
it,
in
this
situation
with
an
amendment
or
pleadings
in
the
usual
sense
at
all,
because
what
the
appellants
are
trying
to
do
here
is
not
just
a
little
old
amendment
of
a
pleading,
it
amounts
to
a
deliberate
attempt.
it's
almost
unique
to
subject
administrative
orders
to
piecemeal
successive
review
or
rolling
review.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
filed
a
complaint.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
filed
a
complaint.
would
have
--
we
--
we
have
oral
argument
before
three
federal
judges
at
the
briefs.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
that
--
that's
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir,
because
it's
just
a
historical
accident,
your
honor,
that
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
have
any
application
here,
if
the
historical
accident
that
i.c.c.
orders
are
not
reviewable
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
if
our
orders
were
reviewable
on
the
courts
of
appeals,
say
like
the
--
the
orders
of
the
communications
commission,
s.c.c.
and
the
labor
board,
no
one
would
seriously
contend
that
rule
15
could
be
applied
to
--
to
permit
such
successive
piecemeal
review
of
administrative
orders.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
have
--
know
of
no
case
prior
to
this
in
which
that
has
been
urged
as
authority
for
permitting
or
encouraging
successive
piecemeal
reviews
of
an
administrative
order.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
there
has
been
no
such
case.we
know
of
no
previous
attempt
that
so
apply.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
a
--
talking
about
the
--
sticking
to
--
sticking
to
the
commission's
practice
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
have
been
a
number.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
shortly
after
a
complaint
has
been
filed
in
a
three-judge
court.
parties
have
offered
an
amendment.
neither
the
government
or
intervening
defendants
have
ever
made
any
point
of
that
where
it's
been
done
while
in
advance
at
hearing.
at
the
most,
we
have
asked
for
a
postponement
of
hearing,
a
postponement
of
briefing
dates
in
order
to
adjust
to
--
to
the
amendments
to
the
complaint.
but
this
chronology,
this
is
unique
in
our
practice,
and
so
far
as
i
know,
in
--
in
the
history
of
federal
judicial
review
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
(inaudible)
of
civil
rules
does
apply
in
appropriate
circumstances
to
the
amendment
of
a
complaint
seeking
review
of
an
administrative
order.
we
submit
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
in
denying
the
appellant's
motion
to
amend
because
again,
this
was
not
a
routine
motion
to
amend
filed
at
an
early
stage
in
the
proceedings,
rather
it
came
so
late
that
it
amounted
to
a
deliberate
attempt
to
split
up
to
what
would
normally
be
a
single
review
proceeding,
a
single
day
in
court
into
a
piecemeal
review
of
an
administrative
order
because
the
appellant
stated
candidly
to
the
three-judge
court
that
they
would
seek
to
amend
their
complaint.
if
the
one
question
under
section
5,
which
they
had
raised
in
their
original
complaint,
if
that
question
was
resolved
against
them,
then
they
would
like
to
amend
to
--
to
litigate
some
further
questions.
and
raising
--
raising
the
question
on
amendment
that
late
is
essentially
the
same,
we
submit,
in
terms
of
the
wasting
of
judicial
time
and
the
harassment
of
parties,
as
if
they
had
actually
waited
until
the
three-judge
court
had
rendered
its
decision
and
judgment
upon
the
one
point
raised
in
the
complaint.
now,
such
repetitive
review,
such
piecemeal
review
of
commission
orders,
we
submit,
is
repugnant
to
the
whole
pattern
of
arrangements
which
congress
has
provided
and
indeed
which
this
court
has
impart
provided
for
the
review
of
administrative
orders.
some
years
ago
in
the
united
states
v.
griffin,
this
court
had
occasioned
to
analyze
the
review
provisions
provided
for
the
review
of
interstate
commerce
commission
orders.
and
the
court
specifically
adverted
to
the
fact
that
congress
sought
to
avert
the
delays
incident
to
litigation.
and
in
many
recent
regulatory
statutes,
almost
typically,
congress
has
specified
a
period
within
which
proceedings
for
judicial
review
of
particular
types
of
administrative
orders
must
be
brought,
such
periods
are
typically
30
or
60
days.
but
this
whole
pattern
of
congressional
purpose
and
the
purpose
of
this
court
were
reasonably
expeditious
review
of
orders
for
a
single
day
in
the
court
for
those
that
want
to
challenge
regulatory
orders
is
thwarted.
if
this
new
theory
of
a
piecemeal
ruling
review
of
orders
and
the
guides
of
amendments
to
complaints
is
accepted,
if
this
--
in
many
respects,
we
view
this
aspect
of
the
case
as
more
important
than
the
subsequent
law
aspect
because
in
these
rate
cases
in
particular,
and
i
emphasize
i
--
this
is
no
reflection
on
the
parties
to
this
case,
i'm
just
speaking
generally,
in
these
rate
cases,
delay
is
typically
worth
a
great
deal
to
one
side
or
the
other.
delay
is
precious
to
the
carrier
if
it
has
rate
--
if
it
has
rates
in
effect.
delay
is
precious
to
the
protesters
if
the
carrier
can't
get
rate
--
can't
get
rates
into
effect.
and
if,
by
a
theory
of
amendments
to
complaints,
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
other
orders
of
federal
regulatory
agencies
can
be
subjected
to
this
kind
of
piecemeal
review,
then
they'll
--
then
it
--
that
there
will
have
been
created
a
unique
procedure
for
dilatory
tactics.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
may
i
review
the
posture
of
the
case?
a
complaint
filed
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
responsive
pleadings,
briefs,
briefs
on
the
merits
of
the
one
question
under
section
5,
which
the
appellant
raised
in
their
original
complaint,
counsel
for
the
parties,
assemblance
san
francisco
before
the
three-judge
court,
argument
is
held
on
the
merits
of
the
one
question
raised
in
the
original
complaint.
and
in
the
course
of
that
argument
for
the
first
time,
the
court
has
told,
the
defendants
are
told
by
the
appellants
that
if
this
one
question
raised
by
them
in
their
complaint
is
resolved
against
them
by
the
three-judge
court,
then
they'd
like
to
amend
their
complaint
to
litigate
some
further
questions.
and
we
submit
that
that
sort
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
case
was
argued
in
--
on
february
23.
on
february
28,
they
filed
this
motion
for
leave
to
amend.
now,
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
1956.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
three-judge
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
april
of
1957.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
14
months.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
may
i
say
this
without
intending
the
slightness
reflection
or
criticism
of
the
three-judge
court.
at
the
time
this
idea
of
amending
the
complaint
was
raised,
their
argument
before
the
court
in
february
of
1956,
none
of
the
parties
had
any
idea
when
the
three-judge
court
would
come
down
to
its
decision.
for
all
we
knew,
they
--
they
might
have
handed
down
a
decision
four
or
five
weeks
later.
in
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
know
now.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
what
i
--
what
i
do
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
course
not,
sir.
but
--
but
i
am
saying
that
in
the
--
that
in
the
ordinary
three-judge
case,
nothing
like
14
months
elapses
between
argument
and
decision.
and
that
--
and
that
in
the
average
case
to
permit
this
sort
of
rewriting
of
the
complaint
at
or
following
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
perhaps
once,
perhaps
twice
for
the
limit
that
that
--
that
will
delay
the
completion
of
these
proceedings,
it
will
--
it
will
prevent
giving
to
these
orders
of
administrative
agencies
the
finality
within
a
reasonable
time,
which
congress
clearly
has
indicated
that
they
should
have.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
submit,
sir,
that
congress
and
this
court
have
defined
justice
in
the
review
of
administrative
orders
as
containing
some
other
--
some
other
factors
too.
everybody
should
have
their
day
in
court,
determines
an
i.c.c.
order.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
this
amendment
business
should
be
so
restricted
that
people
have
one
full
day
in
court,
not
two
or
three.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
your
honor
refers
to
a
gross
injustice,
but
this
was
the
appellant's
choice,
some
tactical
choice
of
theirs.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
i
certainly
do,
sir.
and
--
and
whether
it's
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
those
of
any
federal
agency.
congress
has
intended
and
this
--
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
intention
and
applied
it,
that
--
that
this
regulatory
orders
many
of
which
involved
matters
of
great
moment,
the
whole
regions
of
the
country.
it
shall
--
it
shall
be
final.
it
shall
come
to
rest
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
but
then
the
reasonable
period
of
time,
which
allows
those
who
want
to
challenge
it
one
day
in
court,
not
two
days
or
three
days.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
your
--
and
this
court
has
never
departed
from
that
principle,
happily
or
haven't
been
asked
to
before.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it's
almost
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
record
is
not
before
you.
for
example,
one
of
the
issues
they
wanted
to
raise
was
that
--
was
that
the
commission's
findings
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
evidence
is
not
before
you.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
choose
to
file
the
evidentiary
record
with
the
district
court
and
therefore,
it
was
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
not
certified
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
the
district
court
had
before
it
only
the
pleadings
before
the
commission
and
the
commission's
report
and
the
rest
of
this
were
in
the
record
consist
of
the
various
court
pleadings.
none
of
the
evidence
is
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
on
page
118
of
the
record
and
the
gist
--
the
gist
of
the
court
ruling
appears
to
be
as
follows.
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
power
of
the
court
to
permit
amendment
should
not
be
used
to
completely
change
the
theory
of
the
case
after
the
case
has
been
submitted
to
the
court
on
another
theory
without
some
showing
of
lack
of
knowledge,
mistake
or
inadvertence
on
the
part
of
the
parties
seeking
amendment
or
some
change
of
conditions
of
which
the
party
had
no
knowledge
or
control.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
in
--
but
in
fairness
to
the
three-judge
court,
i
assume
they
were
saying
that
in
the
context
of
the
--
of
the
chronology
of
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
we
--
we
argued
essentially
on
the
facts.
as
i
recall,
we
assumed
that
it
applied
to
permit
amendments
under
appropriate
circumstances.
i
think
we
are
--
i
think
our
--
our
whole
argument
was
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
under
the
chronology
of
--
on
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
the
fact
is
supported,
we
think
they
do.
as
i
say,
this
has
been
tried
so
seldom
if
at
all
that
we
do
--
that
we
don't
have
much
by
way
of
precedent
to
point
to.
but
your
honors
did
have
a
somewhat
similar
question
back
in
281
u.s.
in
grubb
v.
public
utilities
commission
of
ohio.
and
you
dealt
with
it
in
language
which
we
think
fits
here
like
a
hat.
and
you
said,
“he
was
not
at
liberty
to
prosecute
that
right
by
piecemeal
as
by
presenting
a
part
only
of
the
available
grounds
and
reserving
others
for
another
suit
if
failing
in
that.”
now,
that
case
involved
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
the
same
thing.
he
waited
until
he
saw
how
his
arguments
on
the
first
point,
how
they
went
with
the
three-judge
court,
then
he
said,
"let's
--
if
we
lose
on
that,
we
want
to
amend
our
complaint."
that
just
isn't
the
way
orders
have
been
reviewed,
administrative
orders
for
the
last
75
years
under
the
rules
laid
down
by
congress
and
this
court.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
issue
decided
by
the
--
considered
and
decided
by
the
court
below
as
to
whether
this
type
of
transaction
is
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
under
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
now,
the
provision,
which
we
think
is
pertinent
and
controlling,
is
that
portion
of
section
5
(a)
(2)
which
provides
that,
“it
shall
be
lawful,
with
the
approval
of
the
commission,
for
any
carrier
to
acquire
control
of
another
through
ownership
of
its
stock
or
by
otherwise.”
now,
here,
the
commission
exercised
jurisdiction
over
a
double
transaction
but
to
be
consummated
simultaneously,
transaction
by
which
golden
gate
would
acquire
certain
carrier
franchises
and
properties
from
pacific
greyhound,
thus
making
golden
--
golden
gate
a
carrier,
and
at
the
same
time,
pacific
would
still
remain
the
carrier
by
reason
of
--
of
the
franchises
and
operations
which
would
continue
to
operate.
pacific
would
acquire
control
of
golden
gate
by
taking
all
of
its
capital
stock.
in
brief,
what
the
commission
did
was
to
determine
what
was
happening,
what
had
happened
at
the
point
when
the
transaction
was
consummated.
now,
the
appellant's
argument
briefly
is
that
section
5
(2)
doesn't
apply
to
what
they
refer
to
as
split-ups
of
carriers
as
distinguished
from
consolidations
or
unifications.
and
as
a
parallel
argument,
they
--
they
contend
that
section
5
doesn't
apply
unless
using
the
names
of
this
case,
unless
golden
gate
was
a
carrier
prior
to
the
beginning
of
these
transactions.
and
they
contend
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
not
--
was
not
concerned
to
reach
with
section
5,
split-ups
of
carrier
operation
as
distinguished
from
carrier
unifications
or
consolidations.
well,
now,
to
begin
with,
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
literal
statutory
language,
just
looking
only
at
the
language
in
a
very
literal
way,
this
transaction
was
subject
to
section
5
because
by
the
--
by
the
time
the
transaction
is
completed,
one
carrier
has
acquired
control
of
another.
but
more
importantly,
i
think
from
the
beginning,
this
court
has
not
interpreted
section
5
strictly
or
in
any
dictionary
sense.
were
you
going
to
ask
me
a
question,
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
can't
become
a
carrier
as
you
suggested.
it
can't
become
a
carrier
except
upon
the
consummation
of
the
transaction.
for
example,
at
the
--
at
the
present
time,
golden
gate
is
an
empty
corporate
shell.pending
this
litigation,
the
transaction
has
not
been
consummated.
but
if
--
but
when
the
transactions
are
authorized,
if
they
are
authorized,
consummated
is
authorized
by
the
commission's
order.
and
as
they
are
completed,
golden
gate
will
be
in
the
carrier
business,
admittedly
carrying
on
carrier
operations
and
it
will
be
controlled
by
another
carrier,
pacific
greyhound.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
would
answer
--
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
section
5
applies
to
such
a
variety
of
transactions,
but
this
court
has
never
insisted
that
every
transaction
covered
by
section
5
be
spelled
out
in
--
in
quite
that
detail.
and
secondly,
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
show
that
the
purposes,
which
congress
intended
to
be
served
by
this
control
under
section
5
require
that
the
commission
exercise
control
over
this
type
of
carrier
split-up.
because
in
a
--
in
a
number
of
cases
under
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
cases
dealing
with
section
5
and
related
provisions
of
the
act
such
of
those
of
section
20
(a),
concerned
with
security
issues
that
this
court
has
given
a
broad
remedial
sweep
to
these
provisions.
thus,
in
the
schwabacher
case,
you
summarized
your
prior
decisions
as
confirming
the
power
and
duty
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
regardless
of
state
law
to
control
rate
and
capital
structures,
physical
make
up
and
relations
between
carriers,
in
the
light
of
the
public
interest
and
an
efficient
--
in
an
efficient
national
transportation
system.
now,
turning
to
what
we
think
is
the
leading
case
in
the
interpretation
of
section
5,
the
new
york
central
securities
corporation
case
in
287
u.s.
now,
that
case
involved
section
5
as
it
read
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920.
and
at
that
time,
so
far
as
here
pertinent,
section
5
then
--
then
authorized
a
carrier
with
the
prior
approval
of
the
commission
to
acquire
control
of
another
carrier
by
lease
or
by
purchase
of
stock.
and
in
that
case,
the
commission
had
authorized
a
carrier
to
list
the
properties
of
two
carriers,
which
it
already
controlled
through
stock
ownership.
and
this
court
held
that
the
lease,
despite
the
prior
stock
control,
that
the
lease
involved
in
acquisition
of
control,
which
require
the
commission's
approval
under
section
5.
and
we
think
the
gist
of
this
court's
decision
in
that
case
appears
in
one
short
paragraph,
which
your
honors
quoted
last
term
with
approval
in
the
alleghany
case,
and
i
quote
briefly,
“the
public
interest
is
served
by
economy
and
efficiency
in
operation
that
the
expected
advantages
are
inadequately
secured
by
stock
ownership
and
will
be
better
secured
by
lease.
the
statute
affords
no
basis
for
the
contention
that
the
latter
maybe
authorized,
although
the
former
exist.”
then
on
the
alleghany
case,
this
court
recognized
what
was
not
really
an
issue
in
that
case.
this
court
recognized
that
approval
under
section
5
is
required
for
the
merger
of
a
wholly
owned
carrier
corporation
and
to
its
carrier
parent.
but
--
and
in
the
alleghany
case,
this
court
said
in
determining,
the
test
to
determine,
the
test
to
apply
in
determining
what
transactions
are
subject
to
section
5
is
the
crux
of
each
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
an
acquisition
of
control,
is
the
nature
of
the
change
in
relations
between
the
companies,
whose
proposed
transactions
is
before
the
commission
for
approval.
and
the
dissenting
opinion
on
that
case
recognized
that
section
5
applies
to
many
intra-system
transactions
by
carriers.
so,
we
think
the
rationale
of
those
two
leading
decisions
under
section
5,
both
before
and
after
the
1940
amendment,
is
that
if
a
transaction
results
in
a
significant
change
in
the
control
of
relationship
between
carriers,
then
it's
subject
to
section
5.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
admittedly,
alleghany
was
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
set
of
facts.
i'm
drawing
on
that
only
for
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
so.
certainly
--
certainly,
the
immediate
issue
in
this
case
has
never
been
before
this
court
or
indeed
before
any
federal
court.
and
we
think
that
such
a
--
such
a
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
haven't
thought
all
of
that
through
frankly.
i
think
the
same
definition
would
apply
if
what
was
being
done
here
was
not
an
acquisition
of
stock
control,
but
if
it
were
being
done
by
lease
or
purchase
of
properties.
as
to
whether
that
would
be
the
same,
it
would
always
be
the
same,
have
the
same
meaning
under
the
tremendous
variety
of
--
of
transactions
which
can
arise
under
section
5.
i'm
reluctant
to
be
dogmatic.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
ultimately,
the
scope
of
it
is
--
is
determined
by
the
courts.
the
commission
has
not
had
occasion
to
deal
with
--
that
i
can
think
of
with
any
other
situation
in
which
it
had
to
--
in
which
it
looked
at
the
consummation
of
a
transaction
to
determine
who
was
a
carrier.
this
type
of
situation,
and
we
cite
four
or
five
identical
situations
in
other
cases
before
the
commission,
is
the
only
thing
in
that
area
that
i'm
aware
of,
in
other
words,
a
split-up
of
--
of
different
types
of
carrier
operations
into
separate
carrier
entities.
it's
the
only
thing
i
know
of
that
we
had
to
deal
with
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
historically,
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
has
not
been
a
--
a
major
thing
in
the
commission's
work.
there
is
this
case
and
the
four
or
five
prior
cases
cited
and
--
and
cited
in
our
brief.
some
of
them
referred
to
by
the
appellants.
there
have
been
five
or
six
cases
at
the
most
since
1940.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
is
a
--
is
a
dangerous
time
in
history
for
prediction
in
the
field
of
transportation.
as
your
honors
probably
know,
we're
in
the
middle
of
a
transportation
revolution,
reassessment
of
the
respective
roles
of
different
--
different
types
of
carriers,
new
--
new
ratemaking
techniques,
new
types
of
equipment.
whether
the
--
whether
the
--
this
type
of
situation
would
arise
more
frequently
or
less
frequently
in
the
future,
i
can't
give
you
an
honest
opinion,
one
that's
worth
anything.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
have
speculated
about
the
same
thing
frankly.
it
hasn't
been
out
so
far.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
can
--
i
can
only
guess,
sir.
i
--
i
have
speculated.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
we
--
we
rely
on
the
clause
a
bit
later
for
any
carrier
or
two
or
more
carriers
jointly
to
acquire
control
of
another
through
ownership
of
its
stock
or
otherwise.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
at
the
end
of
the
transaction,
both
are
admittedly
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
certainly,
that
has
been
the
typical
case.
now,
what
the
commission
did
here
in
substance
was
to
authorize
pacific
greyhound
to
segregate
into
separate
corporate
carrier
entities,
its
short-haul
commuter
operations
on
the
one
hand,
and
at
long
haul,
intercity
operations
on
the
other.
and
on
the
series
of
prior
decisions
beginning
in
1940,
the
commission
has
done
exactly
that
same
sort
of
thing
to
authorize
carriers,
to
segregate
substantially
different
types
of
carrier
operations.
now,
they
are
summarized
in
our
brief
at
pages
15
and
20,
but
i
can
just
pinpoint
each
of
them
now.
in
the
columbia
motor
service
case,
there
was
involved
a
separation
of
contract
carrier
from
common
carrier
operations.
in
consolidated
freightways,
it
was
a
separation
of
the
transportation
of
automobiles
with
special
equipment
from
the
transportation
of
general
commodities
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
equipment.
the
takin
case
involves
the
segregation
of
interstate
transportation
of
general
commodities
from
intrastate
transportation
of
household
goods.
and
the
gehlhaus
case
involved
a
segregation
of
motor
carrier
operations
from
water
carrier
operations.
and
all
those
cases,
the
commission
recognized
that
the
different
management
and
operating
problems
of
the
distinctly
different
types
of
transportation
warranted
their
segregation
into
separate
operations
--
into
separate
corporations.
at
the
same
time,
the
commission
feels
and
i
submit
that
such
a
division
of
a
carrier's
operations
and
no
matter
how
useful,
no
matter
how
helpful
it
may
be
in
terms
of
more
efficient
transportation,
there's
something
that
cannot
be
done
without
control,
without
regulation
because
the
resulting
division
of
assets,
how
that's
done
is
crucial
to
the
ability
of
each
of
the
--
of
the
succeeding
corporations
to
--
to
serve
the
public.
it
relates
to
--
well,
it
can
affect
their
credit
standing
and
other
matters
with
which
congress
intended
the
commission
to
concern
itself
in
exercising
its
powers
under
section
5.
so
we
think
that
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case
and
the
type
of
thing
the
commission
did
here
in
authorizing
a
division
of
carrier
operations,
as
it
did
on
these
other
--
in
these
prior
cases
is
consistent,
not
only
with
the
letter
of
section
5
to
which
we
don't
attach
so
much
weight
but
to
the
broad
purposes
of
section
5,
which
this
court
has
recognized
again
and
again.
in
brief,
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
economic
transportation
that
carriers
would
be
able
to
do
this
depending
upon
the
circumstances
to
--
to
divide
clearly
different
types
of
transportation
operations
in
a
--
in
a
separate
corporate
entities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
the
commission
made
--
the
commission
did
not
make
a
finding
in
those
terms.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
commission
detailed
at
some
length
in
its
report
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
the
separate
types
of
management
problems
involved
between
the
long-haul
transportation
and
the
short-haul
commuter
operation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
commission
discussed
the
matter
at
length
in
its
report.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
--
the
commission's
report
is
printed
as
a
part
of
the
record,
but
not
--
but
not
on
the
underlying
evidence
is
printed
there.
and
we
submit
that
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
all
it's
before
the
court
is
the
--
is
the
general
--
almost
academic
question
of
the
commission's
power
--
jurisdiction
to
--
to
authorize
this
type
of
thing,
this
general
type
of
thing,
this
--
what
the
appellants
call
a
split-up
under
section
5
of
the
underlying
merits,
which
certainly
could
have
been
challenged
by
these
appellants.
they
could
have
challenged
it,
the
commission's
action
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
all
those
things
which
could
have
been
raised,
haven't
been
raised,
haven't
been
presented
to
the
court
below
or
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
--
i
don't
mean
academic.
but
it's
here
just
as
a
general
question
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
whether
we
--
as
to
whether
we
can
--
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
commission
can
authorize
this
type
of
transaction.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
that's
what
i
meant
to
say,
sir.
now,
i
have
said
that
this
precise
issue
hasn't
been
considered
by
the
federal
courts.
there
are
two
cases,
which
i
find
a
little
difficult
to
understand
but
which
--
which
at
least
deal
with
similar
questions.
they
are
cited
in
our
brief,
their
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
are
dealing
with
the
similar
consolidation
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
those
decisions
of
those
two
courts
of
appeals
at
least
stand
for
the
proposition
that
in
determining
whether
for
the
purpose
of
such
statutory
provisions,
one
carrier
has
acquired
control
of
another
carrier.
the
agency
should
look
to
see
what
the
result
is
at
the
consummation
of
the
transaction.
the
facts
in
those
cases
were
somewhat
different
than
this,
so
we
cannot
cite
them
as
cases
in
point.
we
do
--
we
do
refer
your
honors
to
the
reasoning
from
those
cases,
which
are
set
forth
at
some
detail
in
our
briefs.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
we
can
say
generally
they
were
because
they
are
practically
forbidden,
whole
--
the
whole
paragraphs
of
the
section
are
--
are
verbatim
--
verbatim
list
and
the
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
is
some
element
of
such
distinction.
i
wouldn't
know
how
far
to
go
in
--
in
making
such
a
distinction.
for
example,
there
is
a
--
a
declaration
of
policy
in
that
act
which
puts
a
much
heavier
emphasis
on
the
value
of
competition
in
their
transportation
than
anything
which
appears
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
would
like
to
refer
only
briefly
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
as
a
--
apparent
contention
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
commission
should
not
so
act
under
section
5
as
to
affect
intrastate
operating
rights
which
are
subject
to
regulation
by
state
commissions.
but
your
honors
have
passed
upon
that
general
type
of
question
again
and
again
in
--
in
questions
in
cases
interpreting
paragraph
11
of
section
5.
now,
paragraph
11
says
that
upon
approval
of
a
transaction
by
the
commission,
the
participating
carriers
may
carry
it
out
without
regard
to
the
limitations
of
federal,
state
or
municipal
law
and
specifically
that
they
may
exercise
any
control
or
franchises
acquired
through
such
transaction.
your
honors
have
--
have
considered
that
so
many
times
and
interpret
it,
so
--
and
applied
it
so
broadly
and
literally
that
i
think
we
do
not
need
to
labor
it
here.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
