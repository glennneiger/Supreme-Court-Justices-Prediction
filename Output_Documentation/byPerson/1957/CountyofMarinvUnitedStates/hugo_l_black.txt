justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
testimony
given
before
the
i.c.c.that
$150,000
would
be
adequate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
he
testify
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
commission
found
what
was
--
that
was
adequate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
did
rather
use
it
before
the
i.c.c.,
next
to
the
rehearing
where
it
was
relevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
based
on
his
ideas,
as
i
understood
it,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
because
the
court
declined
to
permit
the
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
they
filed
a
complaint
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
asked
to
amend
the
complaint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it
shouldn't
be
governed
by
that
ruling
so
far
as
the
pleading
is
freely
amended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
should
be
carved
out
as
an
exemption
in
connection
with
complaints
challenging
the
i.c.c.
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
that
apply?
i
don't
understand.
i'm
asking
questions
because
i
always
thought
that
out
of
all
the
rules,
probably
that's
one
of
the
best
rules,
(inaudible)
allowing
people
where
justice
is
required
to
amend
their
complaint
at
anytime
before
the
court
(inaudible)
if
justice
is
required
and
you
--
and
you
(inaudible)
so
as
not
to
apply
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
aside
from
that,
has
--
has
there
ever
been
a
case
before
where
the
questioning
is
argued
or
decided
or
argued
if
that
rule
would
not
apply
to
the
pleading
of
this
type?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there'd
been
many
amendments,
hasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
when
they
filed
their
complaint,
there'd
been
many
amendments,
as
i
recall
it,
before
the
case
is
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
just
think
it
might
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
i
don't
understand
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
a
reason
would
require
that
this
type
of
--
that
we
read
it
out
is
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
this
would
have
delayed
the
carrier?
i
can
understand
your
argument
that
you
will
not
be
allowed
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
delay
in
this
particular
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
delay
would
have
been
brought
about?
when
was
the
case
--
when
did
they
ask
him
and
when
did
the
case
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
beginning
what
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
14
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
would
it
delay
the
judge
to
let
them
do
that
if
they
claim
that
they
had
just
placed
for
the
witness
to
testify
the
one
thing
they
had
discovered
that
he
testified
quite
another
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
know
now
when
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
14
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
judgment
that
--
that
they
could
have
decided
it
necessarily
later
beyond
that
14
months
to
let
them
(inaudible)
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
general
in
flexible
rule
taking
this
out,
idea
that
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
came
to
a
court
of
justice,
two
judges
and
that
people
should
be
allowed
to
amend
at
anytime
if
they
have
some
relevant
reasons
that
will
not
do
an
injury
to
that
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
--
even
though
it
works
a
gross
injustice
in
a
particular
case
would
not
delay
it
at
all,
but
you
are
saying,
we
shouldn't
apply
it,
the
general
civil
rule
which
was
entered
to
achieve
the
ends
of
justice
rather
than
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
about
the
technical
choice.
all
i
know
is
that
we've
had
a
rule
which
we
could
use
to
consider
very
liberally.
the
rule
says
it
can
--
complains
can
be
amended
in
a
regular
lawsuit
even
after
the
--
after
the
case
has
been
argued
and
the
charge
has
been
made.
that's
the
general
idea
of
justice
referred
and
you
say
that
we
should
depart
from
it
in
connection
with
the
challenges
against
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
one
day
--
that
one
day
is
the
revenue
concept,
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
that
--
if
you
mean
by
that
that
while
a
case
is
in
progress
[laughs],
it
goes
on
for
two
years.
you
got
to
stick
to
the
original
pleadings
as
the
word.
you
will
never
go
back
on
it
because
in
some
other
case,
it
might
delay
a
--
it
might
delay
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
they
did
not
take
the
position
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
language
did
the
court
use
in
declining
to
permit
the
amendment?
did
it
use
anything
like
the
language
of
the
rule
or
anything
that
was
its
equivalent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that,
as
i
recall
it,
is
the
language
that
was
used
in
connection
of
those
things
many
years.
but
state
and
the
federal
court
before
the
(inaudible)
rules
of
amendment
were
adopted
and
that,
as
i
recall
it,
is
the
language
that's
used
frequently
in
reference
to
setting
aside
judgment
by
the
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
he
did
(inaudible)
as
far
as
his
language
is
concerned.
he
used
the
language,
which
indicated
his
adherence
to
the
idea
that
you
had
to
satisfy
the
criteria
for
a
judgment
--
judgment
by
the
court
set
aside
rather
than
make
an
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
argue
there
or
did
the
commission
argued
there
that
that
the
rule
shouldn't
apply?
rule
15?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
understand
that
argument.
i
think
that's
clear
and
valid
agreement
if
--
if
the
fact
is
supported.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
carriers.
did
either
one
of
them
or
did
the
alleghany
case
will
support
your
judgments
to
hold
that
the
section
5
applied
where
one
was
a
carrier
and
one
was
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
just
wondered
if
the
--
if
the
(inaudible)
has
this
court
ever
approved
application
of
section
5,
acquisition
of
one
carrier
over
a
non-carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
ginnane,
do
you
have
to
depend
for
--
to
charge
of
the
commission
on
the
purchase,
words
of
(inaudible)
should
be
lawful
with
approval
and
authorization
of
the
commission
as
provided
in
subdivision
(b)
for
two
or
more
carriers
to
consolidate
or
merge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
another
carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
thing
[laughs]
is
disturbed
in
our
case
unless
both
of
these
were
carriers.
what
adequate
information
you
get
through
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
they
saw
it,
they're
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
this
meant
that
--
i
--
i
presume
it
meant
but
it
sounds
like
it
meant
that
somebody
could
at
least
two
carriers
could
initiate
it
or
one
could
initiate
it,
the
action
to
get
control
of
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
academic.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
you
have
any
power
though?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
you
have
any
power
at
all?
