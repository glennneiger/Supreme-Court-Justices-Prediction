mr.
spurgeon
avakian
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
special
machinery
provided
by
congress
in
section
5
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
encourage
consolidations
of
carriers
can
be
used
for
the
slit
up
of
a
single
carrier's
operations
into
separate
corporations
for
the
purpose
of
escaping
the
regulatory
policies
applied
by
the
state
utility
commission
to
the
essentially
intrastate
operations
involved
in
the
split-up.
it
also
raises
the
issue
of
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
leave
to
amend
the
complaint
to
challenge
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
where
the
original
complaint
raised
only
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
statute
and
the
amendment
was
offered
contemporaneously
with
the
submission
of
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
issue
as
to
the
applicability
of
section
5
is
of
particular
significance
because
of
the
interplay
of
federal
state
relationships
in
the
regulation
of
local
transportation
services.
the
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
affirming
the
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that
order,
which
was
rendered
in
1955,
granted
an
application
by
pacific
greyhound
lines
and
its
newly
created
subsidiary,
golden
gate
transit
lines,
to
transfer
greyhound's
local
san
francisco
bay
area
operations
to
the
new
subsidiary,
golden
gate.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
held
that
section
5
applied.
this
section
provides
that
the
transactions
for
the
consolidation
or
merger
or
unification
of
carrier
operations,
either
by
acquisition
of
property
or
by
arrangements
for
common
control,
must
be
first
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
when
so
approved
may
be
consummated
without
regard
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
without
the
approval
of
any
other
federal
agency
or
of
any
state
agency.
if
section
5
does
not
apply
to
this
transaction,
then
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
authority
is
limited,
under
section
212
(b),
to
a
transfer
of
the
interstate
operating
rights
only
and
the
state
commission
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
proposed
transfer
of
the
intrastate
service.
in
the
district
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
this
service
is
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
essentially
a
commuter
service
radiating
out
of
san
francisco,
a
distance
of
25
to
30
miles,
northward
into
marin
country,
eastward
into
contra
costa
country
and
southerly
into
what
is
known
as
the
peninsula
area.
in
the
district
court,
the
original
complaint
raised
only
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
section
5.
both
sides,
that
is
plaintiffs
and
--
and
the
government,
made
motions
for
summary
judgment.
greyhound
and
golden
gate,
as
interveners,
filed
a
motion
to
amend
and
while
those
motions
came
up
for
argument,
the
appellants,
who
are
here
now,
asked
to
leave
to
amend
their
complaint
to
challenge
the
public
interest
findings
as
well.
the
motion
to
amend
was
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
in
the
district
court.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
amend
was
by
two
of
the
judges.
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
dissented
on
the
ground
that
under
rule
15
(a)
the
amendment
should
be
allowed
in
the
interest
of
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
and
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
oh,
yes,
it
was.
it
was
contested
before
the
commission
and
it
was
contested
on
a
petition
for
rehearing
which
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
correct.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
correct.
on
the
--
on
the
section
5
point,
that
would
control
the
case
finally.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
issue
had
been
joined,
your
honor,
by
this
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
because
the
complaint
raised
only
the
legal
question
of
the
applicability
of
section
5
but
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
there
had
been
an
answer
by
the
united
states
but
not
by
the
interveners.
and
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
the
complaint
originally
was
not
only
by
these
appellants
who
are
two
commuter
associations
and
two
counties,
but
also
joined
as
plaintiffs
originally
where
the
labor
unions
who
represented
greyhound
drivers.
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
to
dismiss
were
set
for
argument
on
february
23rd,
1956.
when
they
were
called,
the
interveners
greyhound
and
golden
gate
and
the
united
states
offered
a
dismissal
by
the
labor
union
plaintiffs
on
the
basis
of
an
agreement
which
had
been
reached
two
days
before
february
21st.
and
that
agreement
contained
the
provision
that
if
this
transaction
were
consummated,
the
labor
contract
of
the
unions
with
the
two
carriers
would
be
a
single
labor
contract.
this
was
directly
contrary
to
one
of
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
public
interest
factors
which
would
be
served
by
this
separation
was
the
separation
of
separate
labor
contracts
for
each
operation
and
the
commission's
order
recited
that
there
had
been
problems
in
the
past
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
greyhound
had
to
deal
with
its
local
drivers
in
the
same
bargaining
agreements
as
it
did
with
its
intercity
drivers.
and
when
this
agreement,
which
resulted
in
the
dismissal
of
the
labor
unions,
was
presented
to
the
court
at
the
time
the
motions
came
up
for
argument,
we
stated
to
the
court
that
in
view
of
this
development
and
our
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
that
of
the
issue
of
public
interest,
we
desired
leave
to
amend
the
complaint
to
raise
also
the
issue
of
whether
the
evidence
supported
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
commission.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
as
plaintiffs,
yes.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
jointly
with
us.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
they
had
raised
the
public
interest
question
before
the
commission
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
but
not
before
the
court.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
they
were
--
they
were
exactly
with
us.
there
was
a
single
complaint.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
and
we
only
raised
it
after
they
dismissed.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
it
is
essentially
correct.
the
--
the
only
thing
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
--
the
unions
were
joint
plaintiffs
with
us
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
in
a
single
complaint.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
neither
one
of
us
raised
it.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
we
made
the
point
because
this
agreement
as
we
saw
this
contrary
to
the
finding
of
the
commission.
the
background
of
this
case,
if
i
may
state
it
very
briefly
and
the
background
is
important
because
the
--
a
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
specifically
recites
that
greyhound's
purpose
in
the
slit-up
is
to
escape
the
rate
regulation
policies
of
the
california
public
utilities
commission.
the
background
is
essentially
this.
i've
already
stated
the
area
covered.
the
population
in
that
area
is
approximately
400,000
people.
the
revenue
from
this
service
which
is
proposed
to
be
split
off
is
approximately
$3,700,000
a
year.
and
of
this
revenue,
5.7%
represents
interstate
commerce
and
94.3%
represents
intrastate
commerce.
greyhound's
dissatisfaction
with
the
state
public
utilities
commission
is
based
on
several
factors.
one
is
that
in
establishing
rates
for
this
local
service,
the
state
public
utilities
commission
has
consistently
held
that
greyhound's
revenue
needs
for
this
service
should
be
determined
in
the
light
of
its
total
intrastate
revenues
and
that
as
long
as
greyhound
receives
an
adequate
return
in
its
total
intrastate
service,
it
is
not
entitled
to
an
increase
in
rates
in
this
particular
segment.
and
i
might
say
that
in
its
rate
decisions,
the
state
commission
has
allowed
greyhound
a
fair
rate
of
return
on
its
intrastate
operations
in
the
most
recent
decision
in
1957,
a
7.1%
rate
of
return
was
allowed
on
the
total
intrastate
service.
in
a
decision
in
1951,
dealing
with
the
statewide
rates,
a
6.4%
rate
of
return
was
allowed.
in
applying
this
policy,
the
state
commission
takes
into
consideration
the
fact
that
because
of
the
necessity
to
preserve
competition
between
greyhound
and
others
in
other
areas
of
the
state,
it
is
forced
to
establish
rates
in
the
other
areas
which
give
greyhound
more
than
a
fair
rate
of
return.
and
that
windfall
is
offset
in
the
state
commission's
minds
by
the
rates
that
it
establishes
in
this
local
service.
and
the
state
commission
also
states
that
it
considers
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
with
respect
to
increases
in
commuter
rates
and
where
it
has
given
increases
in
this
particular
segment.
it
has
felt
that
there
was
a
limiting
factor
as
to
the
amount
of
revenue
which
effectively
could
be
obtained
by
an
increase
by
reason
of
the
diversion
of
traffic
to
carpools
and
other
means
of
transportation
that
would
result
if
the
increases
were
too
high.
and
finally,
the
carrier
here,
greyhound,
previously
tried
to
get
permission
from
the
state
commission
to
transfer
a
portion
of
this
service,
the
marin
country
portion,
to
another
operator.
and
after
a
lengthy
hearing,
the
state
commission
held
that
the
proposed
financing
of
that
transfer
of
a
limited
segment
of
this
operation
was
insufficient,
even
though
the
transferee
was
proposing
to
invest
$200,000
working
capital
in
the
operation.
in
this
case,
which
involve
not
only
marin
but
contra
costa
and
the
peninsula
operation,
greyhound
proposed
to
put
into
golden
gate
only
$150,000
in
working
capital
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
conditioned
its
approval
on
the
sum
of
only
$250,000
as
a
working
capital.
after
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
rendered
its
decision
in
which
it
rejected
the
protest
made
by
the
labor
unions
and
by
the
present
appellants
as
to
the
applicability
of
section
5
and
as
to
the
public
interest,
both
groups,
both
the
unions
and
the
present
appellants
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
commission
in
which
they
again
challenged
the
applicability
of
section
5.
they
challenged
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
commission
and
furthermore,
they
ask
for
further
hearing
because
of
some
additional
testimony
which
had
been
given
after
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
decision.
and
i
mention
this
because
in
the
proposed
amendment,
we
seek
to
charge
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
denying
this
petition
for
further
hearing.
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
proceeding,
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
at
all
stages.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
we
would
argue
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
those
findings
and
we
would
argue
the
question
of
abuse
of
discretion
in
denying
the
further
hearing
in
view
of
the
facts
which
i'm
just
about
to
state.
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
principal
greyhound
witness
testified
that
$150,000
cash
working
capital
would
be
adequate
for
the
subsidiary
to
perform
the
services.
this
was
in
the
phase
of
the
own
showing
of
the
carriers,
that
the
one
year's
operation
would
produce
a
loss
of
$230,000.
two
weeks
after
the
interstate
commerce
commission
order
had
been
handed
down,
this
same
witness,
testifying
before
the
state
utilities
commission
in
a
proceeding
seeking
an
increase
in
rates
for
the
--
for
the
marin
and
peninsula
services,
testified
that
there
should
be
included
in
the
rate
base
or
rate-making
purposes,
the
item
of
cash
working
capital
in
an
amount
equal
to
one-twelfth
of
the
annual
cash
expenditures.
and
in
the
examination
in
that
case,
he
said
most
emphatically
that
this
was
a
necessary
working
capital.
he
even
said
that
a
new
company
would
have
to
provide
that
much
capital.
now,
as
applied
to
this
case,
that
would
require
a
working
cash
working
capital
of
$321,000
and
the
petition
for
rehearing
set
forth
a
verbatim
transcript
of
this
witness'
testimony
before
the
state
commission
and
asked
for
further
hearing
before
the
i.c.c.,
which
was
denied.
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
the
new
evidence
that
--
upon
which
we
asked
for
reopening,
that's
right.
and
our
amendment
insofar
as
it
relates
to
that
charges,
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
denial
of
the
hearing
because
that
testimony
would
be
directly
contrary,
not
only
to
what
was
testified
before
the
i.c.c.,
but
also
would
invalidate
the
i.c.c.'s
conclusion
that
$250,000
in
cash
working
capital
would
be
adequate.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
this
is
not
new
evidence
which
we
wanted
to
present
to
the
district
court.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
we're
charging
that
the
district
court
on
this
phase
of
it
should
have
held
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
should
reopen
the
proceeding
and
take
the
evidence.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
this
was
on
the
basis
of
new
evidence
submitted
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
denied.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no.
i
just
simply
denied
it
in
order
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
it
was
--
while
the
time
for
petition
for
rehearing
was
still
open.
this
testimony
that
i'm
mentioning
was
given
two
weeks
after
the
interstate
commerce
commission
handed
down.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
case
was
heard
by
the
examiner
in
april
of
1954.
the
examiner
rendered
his
proposed
report
recommending
denial
of
the
application
in
the
fall
of
1955
and
--
i
am
sorry,
in
the
fall
of
1954.
and
thereafter,
the
entire
commission
heard
our
argument
and
in
july
of
1955,
issued
its
order
granting
the
application.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes,
we
did.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes,
we
did
and
it
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
because
it
was
a
testimony
given
by
the
principal
greyhound
witness
given
for
the
first
time
after
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decision
come
down
but
relating
to
the
very
issue
of
what's
necessary
working
capital
for
this
kind
of
an
operation.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
not
only
that,
your
honor,
but
in
the
phase
of
that,
since
he
was
the
principal
greyhound
witness,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
if
they
heard
that
testimony,
could
not
possibly
have
concluded
that
$250,000
would
be
work-adequate
capital.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no,
your
honor.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
because
it's
--
it's
something
which
they
speak
from
their
own
knowledge.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
this
is
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no.
the
--
the
thing
that
was
not
available
to
us
was
greyhound's
own
judgment
as
to
what
is
necessary
working
capital.
and
this
was
the
vice
president
of
greyhound
testifying
in
one
case
that
$150,000
is
adequate,
testifying
in
another
case
where
it's
to
their
advantage
to
build
up
the
rate
base
that
there
should
be
included
in
the
rate
base
an
amount
equal
to
one
month's
cash
expenditures
as
necessary
working
capital.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
it's
--
it's
essentially
the
same
operation,
your
honor.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
what
proportion
of
your
expenses
you
need
as
cash
working
capital
would
be
affected
by
time.
it
might
be
affected
by
whether
they
are
the
same
operations
or
not,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
in
april
of
1954.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no,
it
--
he
testified
before
the
state
commission
in
july
of
1955
and
his
testimony
was
that
cash
working
capital
had
to
be
in
the
amount
of
one-twelfth
of
the
annual
cash
expenditures.
and
that
formula,
as
applied
to
the
showing
made
in
this
case
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
the
basis
of
the
expenses
shown
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
would
be
$321,000
cash
working
capital.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
$250,000.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
this
very
company
and
almost
exactly
the
same
operation.
the
state
utility
commission
proceeding
involved
the
rates
for
the
marin
and
peninsula
services.
these
proceeding
involved
those
two
plus
the
contra
costa
county,
which
is
the
smaller
portion.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
he
was
not
--
no.
he
was
cross-examined
as
to
whether
he
was
sure
that
you
needed
this
much
working
capital
and
he
became
quite
emphatic
in
saying
that
you
have
to
have
this
much.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
the
--
no,
the
commission
didn't
have
it.
this
cross-examination,
your
honor,
was
by
myself
as
counsel
for
these
same
people
who
were
appellants
here.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
it's
obviously
contradictory,
your
honor.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
the
point
that
was
involved
there
was
a
different
issue
from
what's
involved
here.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
i
might
say
that
there
--
insofar
as
reliability
of
the
witness
is
concern,
there
was
considerable
cross-examination
on
other
points
in
which
contradictions
had
been
developed.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
not
before
the
state
commission.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right
and
it's
set
forth
verbatim
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
filed
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
before
the
state
commission,
it
would
have
been
relevant.
oh,
i
don't
say
it's
not
relevant.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
there
are
a
lot
of
things
which
are
relevant
in
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
cross-examination
which
the
examiner
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
i
deem
it
relevant,
but
i
didn't
deem
it
within
the
scope
of
--
of
my
judgment
as
to
why
i
should
cross-examine
him
in
the
context
of
everything
else
in
which
i
cross-examine.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
no.
no
--
no,
i
don't.
that's
--
the
question
here
is
whether
the
lower
court
should
have
permitted
us
to
make
the
amendment
to
raise
this
question.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
on
that
branch
of
it,
yes.
and,
of
course,
our
men
would
also
challenge
the
public
interest
findings
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no.
no,
that
is
not
involved.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
not
in
a
legal
sense.
in
a
realistic
sense,
the
--
there's
a
great
bearing
on
rates,
of
course
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
because
in
--
in
a
realistic
sense,
if
the
separation
goes
through,
then
in
an
application
for
rates
involving
this
local
service,
the
only
carrier
before
the
state
commission
will
be
the
golden
gate
subsidiary.
and
this
will
circumvent
what
the
state
commission
has
been
applying
as
a
policy
of
considering
greyhound's
windfall
in
the
rest
of
the
state
in
deciding
what
the
rates
for
this
service
should
be.
now,
i
feel
--
if
the
court
please,
that
this
question
of
whether
we
should
have
been
permitted
to
make
this
amendment
in
the
lower
court
is
effectively
controlled
by
what
this
court
did
just
a
month
ago
in
spevack
versus
strauss,
355
u.s.601,
where
in
granting
certiorari,
it
directed
that
the
matter
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
directions
to
allow
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
which
had
been
presented
there
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
reflects
the
liberal
rules
of
pleading
set
forth
in
15
(a)
of
the
civil
rules.
and
certainly,
if
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
deny
an
amendment
presented
for
the
first
time
in
that
court,
then
all
the
more,
in
our
case,
where
we
presented
the
amendment
at
the
outset
of
arguments
on
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court,
the
amendment
should
have
been
allowed.
and
i
might
say
that
the
court
took
14
months
to
deny
our
motion
to
amend.
our
motion
to
amend
was
made
in
february
of
1956.
it
was
set
down
for
oral
argument
in
april
of
1956
and
it
was
not
denied
by
the
district
court
until
april
of
1957,
a
full
14
months
after
we
filed
the
motion
so
that
it
can
--
the
action
of
the
lower
court
can
hardly
be
explained
or
defended
on
the
ground
that
it
would
have
unfairly
delayed
disposition
of
the
case.
the
lower
court
did
not
contend
that
the
amendment
was
insubstantial.
on
the
contrary,
it
said
only
that
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
mistake,
inadvertence,
neglect
or
changed
conditions,
the
amendment
should
not
be
allowed.
these
are
the
criteria
which
govern
the
granting
of
relief
from
a
default
judgment
and
not
the
criteria
which
govern
the
granting
of
amendments
to
pleadings.
i
pass
now
to
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
section
5
to
split-ups.
the
statutory
language
itself
quite
clearly
shows
that
split-ups
are
not
contemplated
by
section
5.
it
sets
forth
five
classes
of
transactions,
and
if
my
telescope
the
language
but
read
what
i
read
verbatim,
the
five
classes
are
as
follows,
and
these
are
set
forth
on
pages
22
and
23
of
our
main
brief,
“for
two
or
more
carriers
to
consolidate
or
merge
their
properties
or
franchises
into
one
corporation.
secondly,
for
any
carrier
to
purchase
lease
or
contract
to
operate
the
properties
of
another.
third,
for
any
carrier
to
acquire
control
of
another.
fourth,
for
a
person
which
is
not
a
carrier
to
acquire
control
of
two
or
more
carriers.
and
fifth,
for
a
person
which
is
not
a
carrier
and
which
has
control
of
one
or
more
carriers
to
acquire
control
of
another
carrier.”
in
every
instance,
we
start
out
with
two
or
more
carriers
to
come
within
these
provisions.
now,
the
commission
in
the
lower
court
applied
the
provision
--
the
third
provision,
which
i
read
which
is,
“for
any
carrier
to
acquire
control
of
another”.
and
the
reasoning
of
the
commission
in
the
lower
court
was
that
on
the
consummation
of
this
transaction,
golden
gate,
which
is
presently
not
a
carrier,
will
become
a
carrier
once
it
gets
into
the
operation
of
the
--
of
the
service
which
is
proposed
to
be
transferred.
it
will
become
a
carrier
and
at
that
time,
it
will
be
controlled
by
its
parent,
greyhound,
which
is
a
carrier
and
therefore,
we
have
claimed
by
operation
bootstrap
into
a
situation
of
one
carrier
acquiring
control
of
another
carrier.
not
only
does
this
do
violence
to
the
language
of
section
5,
but
it
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
section
5
as
clearly
shown
by
the
legislative
history,
as
this
court
has
frequently
itself
set
forth
in
its
opinions.
this
provision,
section
5,
as
written
into
the
1940
transportation
act
had,
as
its
purpose,
the
provision
of
means
of
relief
for
a
very
sick
transportation
industry.
in
the
1920
act,
which
was
passed
when
the
government
was
turning
the
operation
of
the
railroad
back
to
the
companies,
congress
had
decided
upon
the
approach
of
imposing
on
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
obligation
to
formulate
plans
of
consolidation
of
railroads
into
a
relatively
few
systems.
and
once
the
commission
formulated
and
announced
a
consolidation
plan,
carriers
could
then
initiate
mergers
and
consolidations
but
that
approach
never
worked
because
the
commission
never
got
around
to
formulating
a
plan
of
consolidation.
so
finally,
after
lengthy
studies
by
presidential
committees
and
congressional
committees,
in
the
1940
act,
this
was
all
changed.
the
obligation
on
the
commission
to
formulate
plans
was
removed
and
carriers
were
given
the
authority
to
initiate
voluntarily,
merger
and
consolidation
plans
subject
to
the
requirement
that
they
must
be
approved
by
the
commission
as
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
committee
report
show
that
congress
was
dealing
with
an
industry
which
was
described
as
being
one-third
in
bankruptcy
and
the
other
third
on
the
verge,
and
the
need
for
providing
effective
and
practical
means
of
consolidating
weak
carriers
was
urgent.
obviously,
in
the
case
particularly
of
large
carriers,
mergers
and
consolidations
could
not
effectively
be
carried
out
if
the
approval
were
required
of
every
other
regulatory
agency
which
might
have
jurisdiction
over
any
portion
of
the
transaction.
and
for
that
reason,
congress
provided
that
once
approved
by
the
commission,
this
merger
and
consolidation
plans
could
be
carried
out
regardless
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
without
invoking
the
approval
of
any
federal
agency
or
of
any
state
agency.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
exactly.
it
was
to
--
in
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
never.
every
term
in
this
committee
reports
is
in
the
line
of
merger,
consolidation,
cooling,
unification,
combination,
acquiring
common
control,
all
the
language
and
all
of
the
discussion
is
in
terms
of
enabling
weak
carriers
to
combine.
what
greyhound
proposes
to
do
here
is
to
cut
off
the
weak
member
of
its
single
corporate
body
and
send
it
out
to
flounder
for
itself
and
very
proudly
to
die
in
the
bankruptcy
courts,
and
to
do
this
under
the
--
the
purported
authority
of
a
statute
which
was
designed
to
encourage
just
the
opposite
form
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
section
5
has
been
applied
to
split-ups
by
the
commission,
so
far
as
i
know
from
my
own
research
and
briefs
of
the
appellees
in
five
cases.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
earliest
case
is
1940.
the
second
case
is
1940
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
the
--
in
its
present
form,
it
came
in
1940.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right,
yes.
now,
those
two
cases
in
1940
and
1941
are
the
only
commission
cases
decided
prior
to
the
time
when
we
contested
this
construction
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
so,
the
administrative
history
up
to
the
point
where
we
challenged
it
in
our
case
consists
of
these
two
cases
in
1940
and
1941.
neither
of
those
two
cases
were
they
contested
proceeding,
there
was
nobody
before
the
commission
objecting
to
what
was
being
done.
and
as
our
supplemental
brief
shows
in
the
first
of
these,
the
1940
case,
columbia
terminals,
the
carriers
themselves
didn't
rely
upon
the
exclusive
authority
of
the
commission
but
they
went
to
the
state
commission
and
got
approval
from
the
state
commission
for
the
transfer
of
the
intrastate
right
involved.
that's
the
total
administrative
interpretation
prior
to
the
commencement
of
our
case.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
--
the
three
decisions
since
are
in
1954,
1956
and
1957.
they
likewise
involved
proceedings
in
which
there
was
nobody
protesting
what
was
being
done.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
they
didn't
get
into
court.
these
are
all
commission
decision.
there
are
no
court
decisions.
there's
--
there's
never
been
anybody
in
these
commission
proceedings
who
showed
an
interest
in
the
matter
and
who
therefore
would
have
been
in
the
position
to
go
into
court
on
this.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
every
decision
of
this
court
and
of
any
other
court
has
been
in
the
field
of
mergers.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
we
--
we
don't
reach
the
question
which
divided
the
court
there
because
in
that
case,
you
had
several
existing
carriers
already
under
a
common
control
with
a
proposal
to
--
to
strengthen
or
increase
the
control
by
a
--
a
merger
of
some
of
the
controlled
entities
into
the
other.
and
the
question
there
which
divided
the
court
would
whether
that
transaction
constituted
an
acquisition
of
control
or
whether
the
control
had
already
been
acquired
by
previous
transactions.so,
we
don't
reach
that
question
here
at
all.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
insofar
as
split-ups
are
concerned?
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
how?
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
19
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes,
but
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
big
change,
your
honor,
was
that
under
the
1920
act,
the
carriers
could
not
initiate
a
merger
or
consolidation
unless
the
commission
had
first
announced
a
consolidation
plan.
and
then,
consistently
with
the
announced
consolidation
plan,
carriers
could
propose
mergers
consistent
with
them.
the
1940
act
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
in
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
when
the
motor
carrier
act
was
first
enacted
in
1935,
it
provided
for
mergers
and
consolidations
with
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
pretty
much
the
same
language
which
is
contained
in
the
1940
amendment
to
section
5
and
at
that
time
the
motor
carrier
provisions
were
repealed
from
--
from
part
two
of
the
motor
carrier
act
and
motor
carriers
were
brought
under
section
5
along
with
water
carriers
and
the
railroads.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
correct.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
--
the
divestment
by
transfer
would
have
had
to
have
been
by
approval
of
the
commission
in
terms
of
a
purchase
of
one
portion
of
the
carrier's
property
by
another
carrier.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
--
this
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
as
--
as
long
as
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
as
--
in
that
sense,
yes.
as
long
as
it
goes
from
one
carrier
to
another
carrier,
it's
within
section
5
but
the
--
the
split-up
and
i
use
“split-up”
rather
than
“split
off”
to
distinguish
that
situation,
the
split-up
here
does
not
involve
a
transfer
to
some
other
existing
carrier
but
rather
the
subdivision
of
a
single
carrier
into
two
units.
the
vice
of
this
situation
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
this
--
this
is
like
an
--
an
amoeba
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
subdividing
itself.
only
the
amoeba
has
the
protoplasmic
quality
to
create
a
completely
new
and
independent
unit
out
of
its
subdivision
whereas
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
and
--
and
here
in
addition,
the
segment
being
cut-off
realistically
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
grow
into
successful
and
healthy
manhood,
but
rather,
it's
being
cut-off
in
--
in
such
a
way
that
the
operation
itself
is
going
to
be
a
weak
floundering
and
probably
a
dying
operation.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes,
with
this
qualification.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that
if
it
gets
state
approval,
it
may
have
been.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
that's
right.
it
would
have
to
get
the
approval
whatever
commission
had
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
branch
or
segment.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
i
think
the
--
the
case
which
comes
closest
to
applying
the
philosophy
which
we
think
applies
here
is
the
decision
of
this
court
last
january
in
the
chicago
commuter
case,
the
milwaukee
road
case
in
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
made
an
order
increasing
the
intrastate
commuter
rates
on
the
ground
that
they
constituted
--
the
existing
rates
constitute
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
this
court
held
in
setting
that
aside
that
the
finding
of
that
type
could
not
be
supported
unless
the
entire
intrastate
rate
structure
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
was
inevitable.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
--
the
factually,
of
course,
is
--
is
different
but
the
philosophy
which
the
court
express
about
the
need
for
a
scrupulous
regard
for
the
state
--
interest
of
the
state
under
the
federal
system
which
we
have,
the
philosophy
expressed
in
that
opinion
applies
here
in
the
sense
that
the
court
should
not
oust
the
jurisdiction
of
state
agencies
under
section
5,
unless
the
transaction
is
of
the
type
which
section
5
was
designed
to
meet.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
i
--
i
say
it's
close
in
--
in
the
philosophy
expressed,
not
in
the
issue
presented,
your
honor.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
refer
once
again
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
amendment
to
the
complaint
was
offered.
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
report
at
page
21
of
the
record,
there
is
this
statement
regarding
one
of
the
public
interest
reasons
which
impelled
the
commission
to
authorize
this
transaction.
part
of
the
overall
management
problem
is
that
of
labor
management
relations,
which,
although
strongly
disputed
by
the
union,
applicants
contend
with
benefit
from
the
proposed
separation
of
the
operations.
the
negotiation
of
employment
contracts
with
the
union
in
the
past
has
been
made
especially
difficult
because
the
terms
applicable
to
the
two
classes
of
drivers
have
been
embraced
in
a
single
labor
agreement
even
though
the
operating
practices
have
been
different.
and
then
the
report
goes
on
to
point
to
a
strike
situation
which
resulted
because
of
conditions
peculiar
to
one
group
but
involving
the
entire
system.
now,
in
the
phase
of
that
finding,
greyhound
and
golden
gate
on
february
21,
1956
negotiated
an
agreement
with
the
labor
unions
who,
up
to
that
point,
were
joint
parties
plaintiff
with
us.
and
that
agreement
provided
that
if
this
transaction
went
through,
the
employees
of
golden
gate
and
greyhound
would
be
covered
by
a
single
labor
agreement.
now,
it
was
this
strange
circumstance
on
february
21,
announced
to
the
court
on
february
23,
that
led
the
appellants
immediately
to
reevaluate
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
commission
should
be
challenged
and
appellants
immediately
made
oral
request
for
a
permission
to
amend.
and
as
mr.
matthew
has
just
stated,
the
court
gave
permission
to
file
a
written
motion
with
the
proposed
amendment
in
writing
and
that
was
done
five
days
later,
a
weekend
having
intervened.
those
were
the
circumstances
that
led
to
the
motion
to
amend.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
complaint
had
been
filed
on
october
18.
the
answer
of
the
united
states
had
been
filed
on
december
15.
the
intervention
of
greyhound
and
golden
gate
had
come
about
in
january
of
1956.
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
complaint
was
filed
october
1855
and
our
oral
request
for
permission
to
amend
was
february
23rd,
immediately
upon
the
announcement
to
the
court
of
the
contract
between
the
labor
unions
and
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
the
--
the
relevance
to
me,
your
honor,
is
this.
a
--
a
challenge
to
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
raises
a
question
which,
from
the
appellant's
point
of
view,
is
a
very
difficult
one
because
the
court
must
be
persuaded
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
in
the
record,
none
of
the
grounds
set
forth
in
--
in
the
commission's
findings
are
substantial
and
supported
by
the
evidence.
and
if
there
is
one
substantial
factor
which
would
support
the
commission's
order,
a
challenge
based
on
the
--
on
the
adequacy
of
the
findings
will
not
succeed.
and
very
frankly,
the
one
factor
which
troubled
me
when
i
initially
made
the
judgment
decision
not
to
challenge
the
findings
was
this
question
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
conclusion
which
recited
a
strike
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
having
separate
labor
agreements.
now,
this
was
rather
dramatically
exposed
to
me
as
a
sham
presentation
which
greyhound
and
golden
gate
had
made
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
had
successfully
sold
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
it
wasn't
the
withdrawal,
it
was
the
entering
of
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
contract,
the
--
the
contract
that
was
entered
into
between
the
unions
and
greyhound
is
what
exposed
it
because
that
showed
that
greyhound
and
golden
gate
realistically
were
not
concerned
about
having
a
single
labor
agreement
with
both
passes
of
congress.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
of
course,
it
was
a
satisfactory
to
them
because
as
long
as
they
could
deal
with
--
on
the
single
basis,
that's
all
they
were
interested
in.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
the
--
i
hope
i
can
make
myself
clear
that
the
thing
that
brought
about
the
reevaluation
in
my
mind
of
whether
or
not
i
should
challenge
the
public
interest
finding
and
which
led
to
the
request
for
the
amendment
was
that,
in
my
judgment
as
a
lawyer,
i
thought
i
could
now
possibly
urge
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
substantial
basis
for
the
public
interest
findings
of
the
commission.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
no,
because
the
commission's
finding
was
that
the
separation
would
result
in
their
being
separate
labor
agreements
and
that
would
be
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
the
public
interest
factor.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
well,
that's
--
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor.
but
the
--
this
brought
about
a
completely
different
context
in
which
to
appraise
the
question
of
what
challenge
should
be
made
to
the
commission's
findings.
now,
this
amendment
came
when
the
court
was
first
assembled
to
consider
these
motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
argument
on
those
motions
for
summary
judgment
is
not
waste
of
time
if
this
amendment
is
granted
because
the
amendment
did
not
eliminate
the
statutory
question
from
the
case.
the
court
would
still
have
had
to
concern
itself
with
the
question
of
whether
section
5
applied.
so,
there
was
no
imposition
on
the
time
of
the
court.
the
intervening
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
the
court
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
--
the
court
might
have
concluded
as
one
possible
outcome
under
our
amendment
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
for
further
consideration.
that's
a
possibility.
in
view
of
the
time
which
elapsed
before
the
court
even
ruled
on
our
motion,
14
months
after
it
was
filed,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
contended
nor
did
the
district
court
state
this
is
the
ground,
that
delay
was
a
reason
for
denial
rather
as
it's
already
been
brought
out.
the
reason
for
the
denial
was
that
the
applicable
criteria
were
inadvertence
mistake,
excusable
neglect
and
so
on,
the
criteria
for
a
relief
from
a
default
judgment
rather
than
the
standards
which
rule
15
(a)
requires.
and
i
am
rather
shocked,
i
will
say,
to
have
heard
mr.
ginnane
say
here,
and
this
is
not
set
in
their
brief,
to
say
here
that
rule
15
(a)
does
not
apply
to
proceedings
for
the
review
of
interstate
commerce
commission
orders.
if
that
--
the
novel
argument,
i've
never
heard
it
suggested
before.
if
rule
15
(a)
doesn't
apply,
then
i
don't
know
what
rule
does
govern
these
proceedings.
the
important
consideration
that
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
court
on
this
point
is
that
just
a
month
ago
in
the
spevack
case,
where
the
proposal
to
amend
was
made
in
the
appellate
court
after
the
appellate
court
had
decided
the
case,
after
the
plaintiff
had
lost
in
two
courts.
the
plaintiff
then
asked
in
the
appellate
court
for
leave
to
amend
and
was
refused
and
this
court
remanded
that
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
permit
the
amendment.
with
respect
to
the
application
of
section
5,
i
think
it
has
been
made
clear
that
this
transaction
does
not
involve
any
change
in
the
beneficial
ownership
of
the
carrier
properties
involved
in
this
proceeding.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
operating
rights
or
carrier
properties
belonging
to
one
carrier
entity
are
being
transferred
to
another
carrier
entity.
this
is
not
that
type
of
situation.
the
beneficial
ownership
remains
exactly
the
same.
this
is
not
even
a
case
where
there
is
a
rearrangement
within
a
single
beneficial
ownership
of
the
--
the
legal
ownership,
so
as
to
--
to
increase
the
degree
of
control,
so
that
it
could
be
argued
that
there
is
an
acquisition
of
control
in
the
sense
of
increase.
this
is
not
even
that
kind
of
a
case.
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
where
we
start
with
a
single
carrier
and
subdivide
it
into
two.
there
is
no
clause
of
the
statutory
language
which
does
not
involve
two
carriers
at
the
start.
now,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
--
as
what
to
the
effect
would
be
either
as
to
the
holding
that
section
5
(2)
applies
or
as
to
a
holding
that
section
5
(2)
that
does
not
apply.
if
this
court
holds
that
section
5
(2)
applies
to
this
kind
of
a
split-up,
then
i
venture
to
say
that
it
will
not
take
long
for
the
transportation
lawyers
in
the
country
to
figure
out
that
the
same
technique
then
can
be
used
to
sever
from
a
single
carrier
operation
a
segment
which
is
considered
unprofitable
and
to
do
that
with
a
complete
bypassing
of
the
state
commission
which
has
jurisdiction
over
that
segment.
this
court
has
frequently
held
that
a
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
no,
if
the
section
does
not
apply,
then
what
is
the
problem?
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
then
the
--
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
then
--
then
in
this
situation,
the
intrastate
operating
rights
could
not
be
transferred
without
the
approval
of
the
state
commission.
the
i.c.c.
under
section
212
could
authorize
the
transfer
only
of
the
interstate
operating
rights
involved
and
that
where
it
comes
then
to
the
other
facet
of
the
question.
would
a
holding
that
section
5
(2)
is
inapplicable
to
create
any
problems?
counsel
for
appellees
talked
about
a
jurisdictional
void.
there
is
no
jurisdictional
void
because
section
212
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
applying
to
motor
carriers,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
6
of
our
main
brief,
says,
“except
as
provided
in
section
5,
any
certificate
or
permit
may
be
transferred
pursuant
to
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
commission
may
prescribe."
so
that
automatically,
if
section
5
does
not
apply,
the
commission
still
has
jurisdiction
as
to
the
interstate
rights
under
section
212
(b),
so
there
is
no
void
in
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
area
of
non-regulation.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes,
about
--
not
quite
6%
of
the
traffic
is
interstate.
mr.
spurgeon
avakian
yes,
that's
right.
so
that
we
don't
have
this
problem
of
creating
a
void
in
regulation.
the
general
counsel
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
will
presumably
is
in
a
better
position
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
to
advise
the
court
as
to
what
problems
might
arise,
was
powerless
to
set
forth
any
problem
which
might
be
created.
and
it's
clear
that
there
can
be
done
because
there
will
still
not
be
any
possibility
of
manipulations
without
obtaining
the
authority
of
some
commission,
whatever
commission
has
the
jurisdiction.
