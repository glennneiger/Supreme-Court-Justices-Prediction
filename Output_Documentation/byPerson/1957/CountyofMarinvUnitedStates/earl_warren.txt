chief
justice
earl
warren
just
--
just
a
moment
--
just
a
moment
please.
you
may
respond
when
your
time
comes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
respond
when
your
time
comes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginnane.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
response
from
the
--
from
the
court
at
the
time
they
first
mentioned
that
they
wanted
to
amend
the
complaint?
did
the
--
did
the
court
intimate
whether
it
would
entertain
the
motion
of
that
kind
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
we're
saying
is
this,
he
isn't
asking
to
have
another
suit.
he
merely
asked
to
--
to
amend
his
pleadings
here
so
he
can
have
it
all
determined
in
one
suit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
was
just
going
to
--
to
ask
if
the
language
didn't
import
the
fact
that
--
that
the
commission
could
give
approval
to
a
carrier
not
to
make
a
carrier
and
then
give
it
approval
but
to
--
to
give
it
to
a
carrier
and
if
you
can
be
a
little
more
specific,
i'd
like
to
--
i
like
to
know
how
you
--
you
--
why
you
claim
that
this
company
that
never
had
anything
to
do
with
transportation
before
can
be
a
carrier
until
the
judgment
becomes
final.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
congress
meant
that,
why
wouldn't
they
say
for
any
corporation
authorized
by
the
commission
to
become
a
carrier
to
acquire
control
of
another
if
it
meant
just
that
--
just
what
you
said
it
means.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
use
the
word
"carriers"
in
all
of
these
subdivisions
in
exactly
the
same
way?
do
you
think
wherever
the
word
"carrier"
appears
in
1,
2,
3,
4
or
5
that
it
should
be
interpreted
the
way
you
have
interpreted
it
for
us
here
in
--
in
this
particular
subdivision?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
say
that
you
conclude
from
that
when
--
that
whenever
congress
does
use
the
word
"carrier",
you'll
know
it
might
be
designedly
that
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
a
right
to
determine
when
and
--
and
where
it
will
consider
that
they
must
be
carriers
before
--
before
the
proceeding
or
--
or
whether
they
can
wait
until
it's
all
over
and
--
and
the
commission
decides
whether
they
want
them
to
be
carriers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
the
same
legislative
history
with
the
--
with
the
provisions
of
the
cab
proposed
in
congress
for
the
same
reasons
that
--
that
this
section
was
proposed
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wasn't
--
wasn't
the
--
the
provision
in
the
civil
aeronautics
act
more
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
protecting
against
monopoly
and
on
the
other
hand,
these
provisions
more
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
relieving
the
railroads
from
some
of
the
stringent
antitrust
regulations
and
making
it
easier
for
them
to
merge
in
order
to
take
care
of
--
of
the
sick
industry
where
the
other
was
rebutting
industry
and
they
want
to
keep
the
lines
straight
so
there
would
be
ample
competition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
avakian
--
oh,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
matthew.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
is
up,
mr.
matthew.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
you
may
complete
your
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right.
mr.
avakian.
