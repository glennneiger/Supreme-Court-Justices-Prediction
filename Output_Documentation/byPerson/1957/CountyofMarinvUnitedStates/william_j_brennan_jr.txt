what
is
the
service
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
i
gather
that
both
proceedings
are
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
certainly
as
though
it
states
here
of
a
question
whether
the
state
commission
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
will
not
--
the
outcome
here
will
not
determine
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
understand
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
the
commission
therefore
applied
section
5
to
split-up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
what's
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
section
5
is
1920,
came
in
1920.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
it's
--
it
came
in
originally
and
it
might
be
in
1920.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hasn't
there
been
any
provision
decision
at
all
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
they
get
into
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
you
have
jurisdiction
to
(inaudible)
commuter
services
for
example
are
unprofitable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
if
this
is
(inaudible)
in
this
case,
it
might
(inaudible)
some
analysis
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
we
don't
have
the
right
of
the
commission
before
us.
but
is
there
findings
(inaudible)
on
its
own
list,
as
i
understand
it,
large
community
service
has
the
better
chance
of
possibly
in
--
in
the
public
interest
of
its
own
(inaudible)
and
enacted
with
the
--
the
way
now
it
is
in
the
general
operations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
underlying
all
this
is
more
economic
transportation
for
the
overall
public
benefit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
consideration
which
leads
to
the
approving
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
necessarily,
that
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
some
judgment
though
that
at
least
this
particular
community
service
is
not
going
to
be
impaired
by
this
separation
from
the
general
operation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
it
but
we
don't
have
it
now.
