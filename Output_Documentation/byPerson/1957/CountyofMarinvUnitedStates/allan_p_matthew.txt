mr.
allan
p.
matthew
pardon
me.
mr.
allan
p.
matthew
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
time
remaining
is
quite
brief
and
yet
i
do
wish
to
say
a
few
things
on
both
of
the
two
issues
which
are
before
the
court
at
this
time.
i
must
be
brief.
i
realized
that
perhaps
it
can
be
little
more
than
a
summary
but
first
dealing
with
this
jurisdictional
issue.
may
i
say
that
i
think
i
would
respond
to
the
question
posed
by
the
chief
justice
and
other
justices
as
to
what
particular
language
of
the
section
is
that
upon
which
we
rely
to
validate
this
particular
transaction.
i
would
refer
it
by
section
5
(11),
a
text
appearing
upon
page
5
--
15
rather
of
our
brief
for
the
appellees,
golden
gate
transit
lines,
et
al,
and
now,
i
just
briefly
read,
“the
authority
conferred
by
this
section
shall
be
exclusive
and
plenary,
and
any
carrier
or
corporation
participating
in
or
resulting
from
any
transaction
approved
by
the
commission
thereunder,
shall
have
full
power,"
and
so
forth.
mr.
allan
p.
matthew
no,
but
i
think
it
defined
just
what
is
in
section
5
and
it
does
apply
to
resulting
(inaudible)
and
i
have
had
no
doubt
and
i
examined
the
provision
of
the
statute
time
and
time
again.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
was
at
particular
pains
to
button
up
and
complete
this
jurisdiction
to
the
commission,
so
that
there'll
be
no
means
to
escape
from
it.
and
we
venture
to
say
upon
our
brief
here
that
we
can't
conceive
any
language
as
a
more
comprehensive
and
get
so
specific.
now,
clearly,
we
do
have
a
carrier
which
will
result
from
the
transaction
which
the
commission
has
approved.
i
think
that's
right
within
the
expressed
terms
of
the
statute.
now,
we
carry
forward
just
a
bit.
this
is
an
intra-system
transaction.
these
are
words
frequently
used
by
this
court.
the
--
it
is
not
to
the
course
that
these
provisions
of
the
statute
deal
only
with
mergers
and
consolidations.
granting
of
that
was
the
main
objective,
objective
as
of
the
legislation
as
it
has
been
developed
here
thus
far.
the
statute
does
not
restricted
to
that
but
covers
all
manual
acquisitions
and
specifically
some
purely
intra-system
transactions.
now,
the
transaction,
which
was
authorized
by
the
commission
and
approved
by
this
court
in
the
new
york
central
securities
case,
was
nothing
but
an
intra-system
transaction
and
is
observed
by
--
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
alleghany
case,
in
commenting
upon
the
decision
in
the
new
york
security
--
central
securities
case.
it
is
said
that
section
5
(2)
(a)
requires
many,
many
intra-system
transactions
to
be
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
commission
and
that
was
too
here.
now,
mr.
ginnane
has
referred
to
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
the
schwabacher
case,
which
we
think
is
very
significant
because
we
have
there
set
forth
in
a
single
sentence
what
i
may
call
the
basic
philosophy
of
these
provisions
alone.
and
i
briefly
read
that
one
sentence
again,
“the
tenure
of
all
of
this
was
to
confirm
the
power
and
duty
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
regardless
of
state
law
to
control
rate
and
capital
structures,
physical
makeup
and
relation
to
tin
carriers
in
the
light
of
the
public
interest
in
an
efficient
national
transportation
system.”
neither
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
immediate
program
which
the
commission
approved
in
our
case,
this
transaction
is
within
the
precise
times,
as
i
read
it,
of
this
declaration
of
basic
policy
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
schwabacher
case.
i
could
continue
beyond
it
but
i
think
that's
all
that
i
need.
i
--
i
want
to
act
to
this
great
equation
as
to
the
possible
consequences
of
a
ruling
here
that
this
transaction
is
enough
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
there
would
be
a
very
unfortunate
jurisdictional
void
of
these
particular
carriers,
the
greyhound,
if
you
please,
or
a
real
carrier
could
form
a
subsidiary
corporation
to
be
controlled
by
it
and
transfer
to
that
carrier
such
properties
as
it
might
desire
and
could
transfer
to
it
stock
in
other
corporations,
thus
seeking
the
approval
of
the
commission.
now,
the
commission
has
brought
that
out
in
its
brief
here
and
said
so
in
several
decisions,
there'll
be
a
void
if
a
transaction
to
this
immediate
character
were
not
subject
to
the
commission's
control.
now,
there's
much
more
that
i
would
like
to
say
on
that
jurisdictional
question
but
i
think
i
have
enough
time,
but
i
do
want
to
answer
an
inquiry
that
came
from
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe,
as
to
the
findings
of
the
commission
as
to
how
the
carriers
would
function
under
this
transaction
as
authorized.
the
opinion
of
the
commission
is
here.
of
course,
the
record
before
the
commission
is
not
here.
it
was
not
before
the
lower
court
as
has
been
stated.
i
am
not
free
to
discuss
anything
in
that
record.
those
issues,
many
of
them
and
not
before
this
court
now,
but
we
asked
the
court
in
particular
to
review
what
the
commission
says
upon
pages
17
to
18
of
--
no,
we
passed
that,
pardon
me,
and
i
correct
that,
upon
pages
27
to
28
in
particular
of
its
opinion.
there
starting
with
the
--
well,
i
say
the
paragraph
at
the
middle
of
that
page
27,
where
the
commission
addresses
itself
to
the
public
interest
in
the
national
transportation
policy
and
then
where
the
paragraph
commencing
toward
the
bottom
of
that
page,
it
deals
with
the
whole
problem
which
was
here
before
the
commission
in
dealing
with
these
local
operations
and
briefly
points
out,
and
i'll
just
mentioned
this,
briefly
refers
in
the
third
line
of
that
last
paragraph
to
the
impractical
retention
in
a
single
entity
of
how
the
similar
operation
it
is
on,
then
it
deals
with
the
services
which
will
be
left.
all
of
this
will
be
subdivided
on
page
28
then
further
on
page
--
i'll
just
briefly
refer
to
this,
31.
it
makes
these
findings
as
to
consistency
to
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
i
can't
comment
beyond
that
and
i
again
will
point
out,
there's
just
one
issue
here
we're
dealing
with
in
this
branch
of
the
case
and
that
is
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
it
was
jurisdiction
in
the
commission
to
authorize
this
transaction.
we
submit
that
it
was
and
that
it
be
ghastly
against
the
public
interest
if
that
jurisdiction
we
held
not
to
exist
there.
now,
just
a
few
words
about
the
effort
to
amend
this
complaint,
there
would
be
no
much
understanding
as
to
the
circumstances
there.
we
have
not
contend
it
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
mr.
ginnane
has
not
given
the
court
the
impression
that
under
all
conditions,
a
complaint
attacking
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
seeking
its
annulment
should
not
be
subject
to
amendment.
in
proper
case,
there
might
be,
but
the
congress
has
made
it
very
clear
and
this
is
spelled
out
so
carefully
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
for
the
anonymous
court
in
the
griffin
case
in
303
united
states
that
i'm
sure
are
not
to
be
overlooked.
it
gives
us
the
history
of
these
rules
for
expedited
procedure
in
dealing
with
complaints
brought
to
in
all
orders,
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
points
out
that
they
originated
in
1903
with
statutes
to
enforce
the
antitrust
act
or
opposing
it.
and
then
in
1906
by
the
hepburn
act,
they
were
extended
of
the
interstate
commerce
commissioner.
then
in
1910,
when
the
commerce
court
is
created,
they
were
continued
in
effect.
some
20
years
later
when
the
commerce
court
was
abolished,
they
were
still
continue
to
effect
under
the
terms
of
the
urgent
deficiencies
act.
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
--
brandeis
makes
it
exceedingly
here,
so
clear
that
surely
we
ought
not
to
disregard
them
at
all,
and
i'm
quoting
in,
referring
to
these
expedited
procedures.
he
says,
“these
expedited
procedures
in
suits
by
the
united
states
--
pardon
me
just
a
moment.
“these
extradited
procedures
--
pardon
me.
i'm
trying
to
go
along
too
hasty
i
guess.
the
court
says
and
this
is
quoted
upon
page
41
of
the
commission's
brief
here
that
--
and
i'm
quoting,
“upon
both
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
rest
the
obligation
to
give
the
case
precedence
over
others.”
and
he
says
further
and
i
again
quote
it,
“in
such
cases,
congress
sought
to
guard
against
ill-conceited
action
by
a
single
judge
and
to
avert
delays
ordinarily
instant
litigation.”
so
that
congress
in
this
type
of
case
has
particularly
undertook
to
guard
against
the
very
sorted
length
that
our
adversaries
thought
to
impose
upon
us
in
this
case.
now,
just
a
few
words
about
the
chronology
of
this
case
if
my
time
is
not
expired.
that
chronology
has
some
importance.
the
court
will
bear
in
mind
that
the
order
of
the
commission
was
entered
on
july
6,
1955.
it
was
already
nearly
three
years
old
incidentally.
on
october
18,
1955,
the
complaint
to
annul
the
order
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
san
francisco.
on
february
17,
1956,
appellant's
motion
for
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings
was
filed,
following
motion
for
judgment
in
pleadings
by
the
government
and
motion
to
dismiss
on
our
part.
now,
on
february
28,
1956,
where
the
appellant's
motion
relieved
to
amend
the
complaint.
that
is
only
11
days
after
he
had
pleaded
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
now,
let's
turn
to
the
transcript
just
a
moment,
if
we
have
that
much
time.
page
17,
we
have
--
i
think
it's
page
17,
the
appellant's
motion
for
leave
to
--
pardon
me,
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
filed
february
17,
1956,
commencing
at
the
fifth
line
at
the
bottom.
it
is
alleged,
there
is
no
question
of
fact
involved
in
the
case
and
the
sole
question
presented
is
one
of
law,
which
should
be
determined
in
favor
of
the
prejudice.
therefore,
he
was
entitled
to
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
we
turn
over
pages
--
just
to
page
74.
on
pages
74
to
78
inclusive,
we
have
his
motion
where
leave
to
amend
his
complaint
filed
only
11
days
after
he
filed
his
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
i
want
to
answer
one
further
question
that
came
from
the
chief
justice.
when
appellant's
counsel
made
the
first
suggestion
to
the
court
at
the
opening
of
the
hearing
on
february
23rd,
it's
the
first
time
he
suggested
it
that
if
the
court
was
going
to
rule
against
him
on
his
jurisdictional
issues,
he
want
to
leave
to
amend
--
pardon
me.
must
i
stop?
mr.
allan
p.
matthew
could
i
just
complete
that
one
sentence?
mr.
allan
p.
matthew
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allan
p.
matthew
but
i
don't
want
to
leave
any
misunderstanding,
that's
all.
when
the
--
i'm
sorry,
but
he
made
the
suggestion
that
the
court
might
rule
against
him
on
the
jurisdiction.
he
wants
leave
to
amend
his
complaint.
certainly,
judge
healy
is
very
improperly
observed
that
the
judgment
could
not
be
made
in
that
form,
his
constant
desire
to
amend
to
file
his
motion
to
amend.
i'm
sorry
to
(inaudible)
with
my
time.
i'm
sorry.
