may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
may
i
ask,
mr.
knowlton?
was
there
a
testimony
in
any
respect
different
from
--
from
their
testimony
at
the
first
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
the
alleged
victims.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
knowlton,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
furman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
why
there
was
an
--
an
indictment
or
the
robbery
of
this
fourth
man
at
the
time
that
they
happened?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
explanation
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
what
--
i
am
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
needed
him
for
an
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
your
--
if
your
theory
is
right,
would
there
be
any
legal
distinction
between
trying
him
twice
as
was
done
here
and
trying
him
four
times
for
--
on
for
the
robbery
of
each
one
of
them
individually?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
in
this
case
--
in
this
case
the
defendant
had
been
tried
by
--
by
a
judge
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
judge
said,
“i
find
this
man
not
guilty
because
i
don't
believe
they
proved
he
was
present
at
the
--
at
the
robbery.”
and
then
you
proceeded
to
indict
him
for
this
fourth
--
fourth
man,
would
you
be
in
the
same
legal
position
that
you
are
now
or
would
you
be
in
a
different
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
that's
--
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know
if
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
knowlton.

justice
earl
warren

in
this
assignment
to

indigent
prisoner,

it's
a
good
public

since
you
were
granted
and
we
--
we
do
appreciate
it,
sir.
and
mr.

the
