justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
the
date
of
the
indictment
of
the
second
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
didn't
get
the
trial
until
two
years
later
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yager
is
not
mentioned
in
the
other
indictments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
what
bearing
has
determination
--
that
determination
there
can
be
of
why
the
jury
acquitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
my
question
was
what
must
i
determine,
must
i
make
up
my
mind
why
the
jury
acquitted
in
order
to
deal
with
those
propositions
which
you
tended?
how
can
i
--
how
can
anybody
know
why
that
jury
acquitted?
the
jury
might
have
acquitted
because
they
saw
a
young
wife
in
there
sitting
in
court.
the
jury
may
have
acquitted
for
a
thousand
of
one
reason.
when
you
get
all
truth,
one
hypothesis
may
be
more
attractive
than
another
but
it'd
be
nothing
but
a
guess
because
we
know
jury
acquit
or
convict
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
or
for
no
reason.
it
may
have
been
too
late
in
the
day
to
settle
the
controversy
about
him.
a
thousand
and
one
reasons,
they've
entered
into
that
judgment.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
the
bearing
on
your
propositions
the
determination
of
why
that
jury
acquitted.
i
can
understand
you're
telling
what
the
issue
was
before
the
jury.
i
can
understand
that.
that
seems
to
be,
of
course,
relevant
and
may
be
vital.
but
what
they
did
with
the
issue
and
we
know
all
the
quirks
and
the
irrationality,
if
you
please,
that
determines
jury
verdict,
i
do
not
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
i
understand.
that
--
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
--
do
you
think
you
can
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
i
don't
subscribe
the
thought
that
was
down
in
an
unreasonable
institution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
jersey
have
--
allow
for
a
special
verdict
from
those
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
--
would
you
mind
stating
out
how
that
operates
in
new
jersey?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
this
--
is
this
something
like
a
new
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
knowlton,
would
you
agree
that
palko
decided
that
--
that
double
jeopardy
as
a
technical
--
by
technical
i
don't
mean
invidiously
--
it
was
an
invidious
admiralty
that
the
--
whatever
content
double
jeopardy
may
have
these
constitutional
provisions
containing
it
is
not
as
such
absorbed
by
the
fourteenth
--
by
the
due
process
clause.
would
you
admit
that
was
palko's
standpoint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
therefore
the
whole
discussion
of
whole
problem
cannot
be
drawn
out
of
what
the
scope
limits
are
of
double
jeopardy
for
they
knew
the
constitution
is?
do
you
view
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
that
we
are
entirely
on
the
--
on
the
different
terrain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
call
these
differences
in
opinion
which
has
been
revealed
in
--
in
this
court,
(inaudible)
that
clause
came
under
review
or
--
or
not
to
government,
your
problem,
or
this
problem,
or
my
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
have
you
any
observations
to
make
on
the
bearing
of
the
rejected
doctrine
of
inconsistency
and
verdict
upon
our
problem
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
remember
in
the
dunn
case,
mr.
justice
holmes
said
that
if
there
had
been
two
separate
indictments,
separate
trials
for
the
maintenance
of
(inaudible)
the
sale
of
illegal
liquor
and
another
one
for
the
sale
or
the
possession
of
illegal
liquor.
the
sale
evidencing
offered
in
support
of
each
an
acquittal
on
one
could
not
be
pleaded
as
res
judicata
of
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
presupposes
that
the
issue
here
was
the
identification
or
the
--
or
the
killing
or
the
attack
to
san
diego.
now,
that
clearly
was
not
an
issue
if
the
indictment
of
the
definition
of
the
scope
of
the
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
dunn
says
that,
“we
can't
go
into
that
for
the
reason
--
the
only
extensive
reasoning
is
the
quotation
that
justice
holmes
made
of
judge
henderson.”
you
need
to
inspect
that.
the
most
that
can
be
said
in
such
cases
is
that
the
verdict
shows
that
either
the
acquittal
or
the
conviction,
the
jury
did
not
pick
the
real
conclusion
but
that
does
not
show
that
they
were
not
convinced
of
the
defendant's
guilt.
we
interpret
the
acquittal
as
no
more
than
their
assumption
of
a
power
which
they
had
no
right
to
exercise
but
which
they
were
disposed
to
contend.
in
other
words
you
can't
go
into
those.
you
can't
--
there's
no
way
of
determining
what
led
or
did
not
lead
that
jury
to
do
what
they
did
in
relation
to
a
difference
in
coming
up
with
the
second
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
yager
is
not
the
--
one
of
the
defined
people
as
to
whom
the
crime
or
crimes
were
charged.
it
is
beyond
the
capacity
of
men
to
determine
what
it
is
that
they
did
or
didn't
decide
with
reference
to
yager.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
if
you
follow.
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
opinion
in
the
willie
francis
case.
it
doesn't
follow
that
because
you
can
do
this,
you
can
go
on
doing
this.
that's
--
that's
the
kind
of
abstract
mechanical
reasoning
that
is
employed.
