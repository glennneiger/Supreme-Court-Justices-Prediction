mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
which
held
in
a
four-to-three
decision.
the
petitioner's
right
to
due
process
of
law
had
not
been
violated.
the
question
is,
whether
it
violates
the
sense
of
fundamental
justice,
to
allow
the
state
to
dissect
--
to
dissect
one
criminal
transaction
into
four
premises
for
the
purpose
of
retrying
the
same
issue
upon
the
same
evidence
which
led
to
an
acquittal
29
months
before.
the
question
of
fundamental
justice
must
be
answered
upon
the
facts
of
every
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
on
september
20th,
1950,
there
was
a
robbery
of
a
tavern
and
all
of
the
people
in
the
tavern.
in
june
of
1951,
the
bergen
county
grand
jury
returned
three
indictments
against
petitioner.
each
indictment
alleged
the
petitioner
in
concert
with
two
unknown
persons
had
robbed
the
specified
individual.
the
second
count
on
the
indictment
charged
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
these
indictments
were
joined
for
trial
and
this
was
--
these
indictments
were
tried
in
may
of
1952.
at
that
trial,
the
state
called
five
witnesses.
this
group
of
witnesses
included
the
three
victims
named
in
the
indictments
and
two
other
victims
of
the
holdup.
each
of
the
five
witnesses
testified
unequivocally
and
without
contradiction,
to
the
fact
that
he
was
put
in
fear
and
that
as
a
result
of
that
fear
property
was
taken
from
this
person.
these
are
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
robbery
under
the
applicable
new
jersey
statute,
and
these
were
the
elements
that
were
alleged
in
the
indictments.
however,
three
of
the
witnesses
for
the
state
stated
affirmatively
that
petitioner
was
not
one
of
the
robbers.
a
fourth
witness
where
the
state
said,
that
he
could
identify
under
oath
petitioner
as
one
of
the
participants
in
the
holdup.
as
a
result
of
the
five
witnesses
for
the
state,
only
one
witness,
elmer
yager,
affirmatively
identified
petitioner
as
one
of
the
robbers.
petitioner
testified
as
to
alibi.
he
stated
that
he
had
never
been
in
the
town
of
fairview
in
new
jersey
where
the
robbery
took
place,
that
he
did
not
participate
in
the
robbery,
and
that
he
was
in
--
in
new
york
city
with
his
mother-in-law
at
the
time
of
the
robbery.
upon
the
basis
of
this
evidence
the
jury
acquitted
on
all
three
indictments.
petitioner
was
returned
to
new
york
for
incarceration,
and
in
july
of
1952,
the
bergen
county
grand
jury
returned
another
indictment
against
him.
this
indictment
was
the
same
in
all
respect
for
the
first
three
except
that
elmer
yager
was
named
as
the
victim.
elmer
yager
was
the
witness
who
had
identified
him
in
the
first
trial.
in
may
of
1954,
petitioner
was
returned
to
new
jersey,
placed
in
the
bergen
county
jail
where
he
remained
until
october
18th
and
19th,
1954
when
he
was
finally
brought
to
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
the
first
--
first
trial
was
in
may
of
1952,
the
second
trial
on
october
of
1954,
29
months,
was
taken.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
the
date
of
the
indictment
of
the
second
trial
was
in
july
--
i
believe
july
17th,
1952,
about
two
months
after
the
first
acquittal.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
he
was
in
new
york.
he'd
been
returned
from
new
york
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
no,
sir.
at
the
second
trial,
they
called
just
one
witness,
elmer
yager.
he
--
he
is
the
witness
who
had
identified
petitioner
in
the
first
trial.
he
refuted
his
testimony
once
again.
the
four
witnesses
who
had
testified
for
the
state
on
the
first
trial
and
had
disappointed
them
were
not
called
by
the
state.
they
testified
for
the
petitioner.
they
once
again
repeated
their
testimony.
petitioner
once
again
testified
as
to
alibi.
this
fact
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
no.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
no,
sir.
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
--
victims
all
testified
to
the
fact
that
they
were
robbed
and
that
they
--
the
three
of
them
said
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
robbers
and
the
fourth
said
that
he
could
not
swear
that
he
was
one
of
the
robbers.
at
--
at
this
trial,
the
jury
convicted
petitioner.
the
state
in
attempting
to
sustain
this
second
trial
attempts
to
formulate
other
hypothesis
for
the
first
verdict
other
than
the
fact
--
lack
of
identification.
petitioner
contends
that
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
first
verdict
was
that
the
first
jury
found
that
petitioner
was
not
one
of
the
robbers
or
at
least
that
they
found,
that
they
had
not
proved
him
to
be
a
participant
in
the
holdup.
we
contend
this
for
a
number
of
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
state
admits
that
the
only
issue
in
the
first
trial
was
the
question
of
identification.
they
admitted
that
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
they
admitted
in
their
counterstatement
of
facts
in
their
--
in
their
brief
in
this
court.
also,
the
facts
of
the
robbery,
the
elements
of
the
robbery
have
been
conclusively
shown
by
five
witnesses
and
were
not
contradicted
and
were
not
disputed.
the
question
of
identification
has
been
raised
by
four
out
of
the
five
state
witnesses.
finally,
the
only
issue
that
could
have
been
common
and
conclusive
upon
all
three
indictments
was
the
question
of
whether
petitioner
was
one
of
the
robbers
and
the
jury
acquitted
upon
all
three.
the
state,
in
page
13,
of
their
brief
gave
alternative
hypothesis
and
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
or
two
of
mentioning
them.
in
the
first
place
they
say,
that
the
jury
might
not
have
believed
mr.
cascio,
mr.
capezzuto
and
mr
galiardo,
the
named
victims,
when
they
said
that
they
were
put
in
fear
and
had
been
robbed.
this
--
this
wouldn't
require
that
the
jury
in
relation
to
the
three
indictments
disbelieve
each
one
of
these
individuals
upon
testimony
which
was
not
contradicted
and
which
was
unequivocal,
and
testimony
which
was
buttressed
by
the
testimony
of
two
additional
witnesses
as
to
the
fact
of
the
robbery.
they
attempt
to
go
further
and
say
that
maybe
they
didn't
believe
him
because
of
the
retraction
of
a
prior
identification.
this
statement
is
based
upon
an
erroneous
defunction
of
fact
according
to
their
counterstatement
of
facts.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
it
is
one
of
the
petitioner's
contentions
that
one
--
that
there
are
three
reasons
why
that
violates
the
fundamental
justice
to
allow
the
state
to
re-litigate
the
fact
upon
the
same
evidence
which
has
lead
to
an
acquittal.
those
reasons
are
--
that
it
is
--
that
the
prohibition
is
uniformly
accepted,
i
have
been
unable
to
find
a
case
in
which
the
court
has
faced
the
problem
and
held
that
they
said
re-litigate
the
fact.
second
reason
which
i
would
like
to
expound
later
on
is
that
according
to
palko
against
connecticut
and
brock
against
north
carolina,
the
due
process
clause
protects
the
fundamental
policies
underlying
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
it
is
one
of
my
contentions
that
there
are
at
least
three
types
of
cases
in
the
double
jeopardy
case
which
show
that
the
prevention
of
the
re-litigation
of
the
same
fact
is
the
fundamental
policy
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
and
finally,
i
believe
that
if
the
state
can
re-litigate
the
same
fact
upon
the
same
issue,
it
undermined
many
of
our
most
cherished
safeguards
in
relation
to
an
anglo
--
of
our
anglo-
american
adversarial
system
of
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
the
--
the
reasons
that
i
attempted
to
bring
this,
the
reason
for
the
court
to
allow
it
is
that
the
state
had
contended
and
the
court
--
and
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
held
that
this
was
not
the
same
offense
and
not
the
retrial
of
the
same
fact.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
because
of
the
difference
in
the
identity
of
the
victim
which
had
no
trial
significance.
it
was
my
impression
that
if
i
could
demonstrate
why
the
jury
acquitted.
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
my
--
i
--
i
--
in
relation
to
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
--
unless
you
can,
there
can
be
no
estoppel
in
relation
to
the
state
and
in
the
same
fact,
and
i
believe
that
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
assumption
in
the
u.s.
against
sealfon
but
further
than
that,
i
believe
that
the
jury
is
universally
recognized
as
a
fact
finder
in
our
system
of
law,
and
as
such
is
entitled
to
a
resumption
--
presumption
of
reasonableness.
it
is
true
that
they
can
acquit
a
retrial.
well,
i
think
that
if
this
is
an
unreasonable
institution,
we
have
universally
adopted
then
a
system
which
--
which
gives
it
to
them
a
power
to
be
unreasonable
and
maybe
we
ought
to
try
again.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
i
think
that
the
significant
thing,
of
course,
is
that
the
issue
at
the
first
trial
was
the
issue
of
my
(inaudible)
as
i
stated
previously,
this
court
in
the
unanimous
opinion,
united
states
against
sealfon
held
that
the
federal
government
could
not
re-litigate
an
issue
which
has
been
previously
decided.
there
are
three
ways,
i
think,
of
showing
that
this
rule
is
a
rule
of
fundamental
justice.
as
previously
stated,
i
think
that
it
is
uniformly
accepted
as
true
both
in
civil
and
criminal
matters.
secondly,
i
think
that
it
is
an
underlying
policy
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
i
think
that
both
palko
against
connecticut
and
brock
against
north
carolina
assumed
that
the
basic
policies
of
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
are
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
brock
case,
the
state
falls
short
of
its
obligation
if
it
--
if
it
attempts
to
retry
an
individual
upon
a
charge
for
which
he
had
been
acquitted.
there
are
three
types
of
cases
where
this
is
significant
or
has
been
demonstrated
to
be
one
of
the
underlying
policies.
for
instance,
a
man
cannot
be
tried
for
murder
after
having
been
acquitted
of
manslaughter
of
the
same
individual.
this
was
held
in
the
case
of
u.s.
against
graf.
the
test
that
was
approved
by
the
supreme
court
and
by
mr
justice
harlan
who
wrote
the
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
was
whether
the
first
verdict
negative
to
facts
in
the
second
charge.
this
test
gives
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
the
first
verdict
was
an
acquittal,
not
a
conviction.
because
on
a
lesser
and
included
offense,
the
first
verdict
would
do
nothing
more
than
affirm
some
of
the
facts
in
the
second
charge
if
it
were
a
conviction.
this
test
also,
i
believe,
emphasizes
the
danger
of
inconsistent
verdicts.
the
same
evidence
test
is
applied
by
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
for
the
majority
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
would
allow
a
re-litigation
except
where
the
evidence
necessary
to
sustain
a
conviction
under
the
second
indictment,
would
have
precluded
the
conviction
under
the
first.
he
reasoned
further
that
since
the
victims
were
different,
there
could
be
no
double
jeopardy.
this
gives
undue
emphasis
to
the
identity
of
the
victims
which
were
not
an
issue
at
the
--
at
the
first
trial.
the
same
maybe
said
for
his
rule
in
relation
to
collateral
estoppels.
whatever
necessity
there
was
in
the
past
for
the
application
of
abstract
logic
to
this
proposition
or
this
problem,
that
necessity
does
not
exist
today.
today
transcripts
are
kept
of
every
trial.
complete
transcripts.
and
a
study
of
the
transcript
can
demonstrate
what
the
issues
were
at
the
first
litigation.
the
second
type
of
case
where
the
principle
against
re-litigation
of
the
same
issue
has
been
demonstrated
are
the
cases
involving
state
appeals.
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
there's
a
statute
which
allows
the
state
appeal.
however,
in
state
against
agnew
it
was
held
that
the
state
could
not
appeal
a
determination
of
the
trier
of
fact
absent
legal
heir.
and
the
reason
the
court
gave
for
that
holding
was,
that
to
allow
such
a
--
an
appeal
would
be
to
successfully
undermine
the
policies
behind
their
double
jeopardy
provisions.
the
third
group
of
cases,
i
think,
that
--
that
demonstrate
this
principle
go
much
further
than
the
petitioner's
case.
those
are
the
abortive
trial
cases.
the
rule
is
almost
uniformly
accepted
that
a
state
may
not
terminate
the
proceedings
prior
to
verdict,
and
then
try
the
defendant
over
again
unless
determination
was
absolutely
necessary.
the
reason
for
this
has
been
given
as
a
fear
that
the
prosecution
sensing
that
the
first
--
the
first
jury
was
hostile,
would
attempt
to
terminate
the
proceeding
prior
to
the
verdict,
so
that
they
could
try
the
same
issue
in
front
of
another
jury.
in
the
light
of
these
three
areas
of
double
jeopardy,
i
believe
that
the
prohibition
against
re-litigation
of
the
same
issue
is
a
fundamental
policy
of
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
and
therefore
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
finally,
i
think
that
to
allow
re-litigation
of
the
same
issue
upon
the
same
evidence
is
to
undermine
any
for
the
basic
safeguards
of
our
adversary
system
of
trial.
the
state
before
it
can
incarcerate
a
man
and
deprive
him
of
liberty
has
to
prove
that
this
man
is
guilty
with
a
high
degree
of
probability.
this
has
been
incorporated
into
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
has
been
held
to
be
requirement
of
due
process.
yet
looking
at
this
record
today,
no
man
can
say
whether
or
not
mr.
hoag
was
one
of
the
robbers.
on
the
issue
of
whether
he
was
one,
the
first
jury
acquitted.
the
second
jury
convicted.
this
does
not
refute
mr.
hoag's
continuing
claim
of
innocence
with
anywhere
near
the
sufficient
or
requisite
degree
of
certainty.
one
of
the
most
basic
safeguards
of
our
system
and
one
of
the
greatest
safeguards
that
we
have
against
erroneous
conviction
is
the
right
to
a
fair
trial.
this
has
been
held
to
be
due
process
in
a
great
number
of
types
of
cases.
yet,
unless
the
verdict
is
given
its
broadest
significance
so
that
the
state
may
not
re-litigate
the
same
issue,
the
concept
of
a
fair
trial
loses
its
validity
as
a
--
a
safeguard
against
erroneous
conviction.
it
does
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
if
the
state
can
retry
the
same
issue
on
the
same
evidence
to
successive
jury
even
though
the
trials
be
fair,
eventual
conviction
is
a
normal
certainty
regardless
of
guilt.
the
same
can
be
said
about
a
jury
trial
which
was
described
by
this
court
recently
as
one
of
the
greatest
bulwarks
against
governmental
arbitraries.
it
does
a
man
little
good
to
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
with
the
same
issue
to
be
submitted
to
a
successive
jury.
sooner
or
later,
a
jury
will
be
found
which
will
convict
regardless
of
guilt.
another
aggravating
factor
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
the
state's
knowing
refusal
to
indict
for
mr.
yager's
robbery
until
after
the
first
acquittal
caused
the
29-month
delay.
mr.
yager
had
filed
a
statement
with
the
police
the
day
of
the
robbery
so
the
government
knew,
the
state
knew
from
the
time
of
the
robbery
that
he
purported
to
be
a
victim.
today
it
attempts
to
overcome
this
aggravation
by
stating
that
mr.
hoag
was
in
new
york,
incarcerated
in
new
york
and
they
couldn't
bring
him
to
trial
sooner.
this
overlooks
the
fact
that
they
knew
from
the
day
of
the
robbery
that
mr.
yager
was
the
victim
and
that
they
did
not
indict.
this
overlooks
the
fact
that
they
did
have
jurisdiction
of
mr.
hoag
the
day
and
at
the
time
of
the
first
trial
which
was
the
ideal
time
to
settle
all
of
the
issues.
secondly,
they
say
that
it
is
not
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
even
though
his
mother-in-law
died
between
the
first
and
second
trial,
and
petitioner
can
testify
that
he
had
been
in
new
york
city
that
he
--
with
his
mother-in-law
at
the
time
of
the
robbery.
they
say
that
the
failure
of
the
first
trial
contemplates
in
the
context
to
the
fact
than
present.
the
failure
to
call
the
mother-in-law
at
that
trial,
under
those
circumstances,
shows
that
she
would
not
have
been
helpful
to
the
petitioner
in
the
second
trial.
the
state
having
caused
this
delay
by
their
own
knowing
action
are
in
a
particularly
poor
position
and
speculated
to
what
the
prejudice
might
have
been
to
mr.
hoag.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
no
sir,
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
record
to
show
why
they
did
not.
therefore,
the
petitioner
contends
that
his
conviction
and
his
incarceration
under
that
conviction,
violates
the
sense
of
fundamental
justice.
the
state
knowingly
refused
to
indict
for
a
known
victim,
they
cut
one
criminal
transaction
up
into
four
offenses,
they
re-litigated
the
same
issue
upon
the
same
evidence,
29
months
after
the
first
trial
and
for
five
months
prior
to
the
second
trial
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
bergen
county
jail
awaiting
that
trial
even
though
the
only
issue
at
the
first
trial
has
been
his
identification.
therefore,
the
petitioners
respectfully
request
that
bergen
county
court
judgment
in
this
case
be
reversed
and
that
he
be
released
from
custody
thereunder.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
although
accounts
for
the
state
mentioned
the
number
of
times
separate
issue,
there
was
admittedly
only
one
issue
in
the
first
trial
and
in
the
second
trial
as
well.
that
was
the
identity.
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
there
is
no
question
on
the
facts
which
they
do
not
take
a
contempt
that
these
people
were
robbed
by
--
the
four
victims
were
robbed
by
different
people.
in
relation
to
the
problem
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
four
--
the
four
victims
named
in
indictment
were
all
robbed
by
the
same
three
robbers.
and
this
is
demonstrated
in
a
number
of
ways,
one
of
which
is
that
the
first
trial,
the
only
identification
was
mr.
yager's
identification.
and
yet
it
--
it
--
a
directed
verdict
was
refused
showing
the
first
trial
court's
recognition
of
this
--
of
this
situation.
in
relation
to
the
problem
of
harassment
under
palko
against
connecticut,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
under
the
theory
of
the
test
of
offense
as
used
by
the
majority
in
new
jersey,
there
is
no
difference
or
there
could
have
been
four
trials
here
and
in
logic
there
is
no
difference
between
two
and
four
trials
on
the
same
issue.
if
they
--
if
he
requires
for
harassment,
a
demonstration
of
the
motives
of
the
prosecutor
that
requires
speculation
and
is
very
often
an
--
an
impossible
task
to
demonstrate
by
the
defendant.
i'd
like
also
to
point
out
this
time
that
the
term
collateral
estoppel
has
been
used,
that
this
case
is
--
does
not
require
collateral
estoppel
in
--
in
its
broadest
sense
where
it
would
--
as
in
sealfon
case
where
there
was
new
evidence
on
the
only
disputed
issue.
in
this
case
there
is
no
new
evidence
on
the
only
disputed
issue
for
insofar
as
the
phrase
collateral
estoppel
would
preclude
re-litigation
on
the
same
issue
with
new
evidence
this
case
did
not
go
that
far.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
term
“offense”
in
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
the
technical
term
that
can
be
expanded
and
contracted
and
that
mr.
kirchheimer
in
the
yale
law
journal
points
up
this
term
the
act-offense
dichotomy
threatens
to
undermine
the
basic
policy
through
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
if
you
--
if
you
define
offense
narrowly
enough
and
the
--
the
test
used
by
the
new
jersey
courts
in
this
case
was
described
by
the
american
law
institute
as
being
the
outstanding
example
of
all
the
tests
today
are
so
narrow
that
they
fail
to
afford
the
defendant,
any
appreciable
safeguard.
if
you
use
the
term
offense
in
that
nature,
certainly
some
auxillary
method
is
necessary
to
preclude
re-litigation
on
the
same
side
and
upon
the
same
evidence.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
yes
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
that
is
--
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
that
is
correct,
sir.
i
believe
that
your
statement
in
brock
against
north
carolina
where
you
said
that
the
scope
was
a
double
jeopardy
provision
or
the
technical
aspects
of
it
were
not
incorporated
but
the
due
process
does
protect
the
fundamental
policy.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
i
believe
that
that
problem
is
distinguishable
because
in
that
situation
you
have
one
jury
with
the
possibility
of
a
conviction
on
--
on
two
counts
or
on
two
indictments
joined
for
one
trial.
in
that
situation,
it
has
been
recognized
and
in
both
the
dunn
case
and
the
dotterweich
case,
which
are
cited
in
my
brief,
that
the
jury
may
compromise
and
--
or
they
may
be
acting
leniently.
now,
the
first
verdict
in
the
first
trial
here
was
an
acquittal
upon
three
indictments.
there
was
no
compromise
in
that
verdict.
there
was
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
i
think
that
he
is
applying
here
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
same
evidence
we
have.
he
--
he
doesn't
go
in
--
in
that
analysis.
he
doesn't
go
to
the
problem
that
we
have
here
where
there
was
only
one
issue.
he
is
stating
abstractly
that
they
may
be
different,
may
have
involved
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
but
the
only
--
since
all
four
were
robbed
by
the
same
robbers
and
since
yager's
testimony
was
the
only
identification,
the
first
verdict
is
inconsistent
with
the
second
verdict
since
that
was
the
only
issue
and
either
trial
was
mr.
hoag
one
of
the
three
robbers.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
well
i
--
i
thought
that
we
had
determined
that
the
crucial
question
was
the
--
the
fact
of
the
issue
having
then
the
identification.
i
think
that
the
state
is
asking
speculate
this
other
possible
reason.
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
well
i
--
i
think
that
in
that
point
we
choose
to
disagree.
i
think
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
presume
that
the
jury
--
i
can
--
i
can
see
the
inconsistent
verdicts
in
one
trial
where
you
can
say
that
the
jury
some
were
for
an
acquittal
and
some
were
for
a
conviction
and
they
convicted
on
only
one
of
the
two.
it's
a
compromise.
but
in
the
first
verdict
here,
there
was
an
acquittal
upon
all
three.
there
was
no
compromise
there.
they
found
that
--
that
he
did
not
rob
these
three
men
in
a
trial
where
the
only
issue
was
whether
he
was
one
of
the
robbers.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
those
circumstances
a
second
verdict
finding
of
guilty
of
robbing
yager
is
--
is
inconsistent.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
leaves
open
the
utilization,
the
extremely
narrow
definition
of
offense.
the
door
--
it
leaves
the
door
open
to
continually
holding
out
one
indictment
in
this
situation
and
continually
saving
one
to
see
if
you
can
convict
the
second
time
around.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
under
these
circumstances,
it
goes
beyond
petitioner's
claim
of
the
denial
of
due
process
to
ordered
liberty.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
constitutes
a
threat
to
any
particular
individual
that
the
prosecutor
determines
he
wants
to
convict
because
it
seems
if
they
can
do
this,
they
can
convict
eventually.
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
my
--
mr.
robert
e.
knowlton
well
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
true
and
i
think
that
this
is
--
that
in
--
in
some,
and
i
think
that
is
true
that
because
they
can
do
it
the
second
time
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
this
court
couldn't
say
that
a
third
time
would
be
harassment
but
i
--
i
myself,
if
i
know
logical
distinction
between
one
and
two
and
they
did
do
--
it
had
two
trials
for
petitioner
hoag.
