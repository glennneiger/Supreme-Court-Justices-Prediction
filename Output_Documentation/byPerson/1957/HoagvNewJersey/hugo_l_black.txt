justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
you're
--
you're
just
starting
out
on
the
case.
as
you
see
the
case,
was
its
possible
under
the
evidence
for
this
people
who
have
been
guilty
of
robbing
yager,
if
they
were
innocent
of
the
charge
of
robbing
the
other
three?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
the
jury
could
have
found
that
or
was
there
any
basis
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
what
was
the
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whatever
they
decided
on
was,
were
the
circumstances
--
did
it
all
happen
as
a
part
of
one
kind
of
this
action
simultaneously
were
practically
simultaneously
insofar
as
(inaudible)
were
concerned
in
connection
with
the
robbery
of
the
four
individuals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
with
all
that's
part
of
one
single
transaction
that
came
in,
committed
a
robbery.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
the
people
in
there,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
yager
forced
to
go
up
against
the
wall?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
yager
taken
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yager
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
yager
was
tied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
facts
(inaudible)
the
robbery
was
concerned,
it
was
all
a
part
of
one
single
robbery
so
to
speak?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
three
--
of
four
different
persons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
say
is
that
--
that
they're
conceding
that
that's
the
fact.
they
robbed
them
all
at
the
same
time.
you
say
that
new
jersey
has
a
right
insofar
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
to
try
a
man
for
the
four
different
robberies
and
four
different
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
two
--
two
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
different
robberies
of
two
different
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
there
are
no
other
--
other
difference
that
you
know
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
one
before
you.
