mr.
david
d.
furman
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
please.
the
state
of
new
jersey
opposes
the
petitioner's
claim
of
the
safeguarding
and
his
double
jeopardy
under
the
benefits
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel.
the
issue
is
whether
under
the
facts
a
state
court
judgment
of
conviction
amounts
to
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
no
case
in
this
court
directly
or
by
necessary
implication
compels
that
result.
no
case
in
this
court
that
maybe
fairly
stated
even
suggests
that
result
under
these
facts.
the
palko
case
and
the
brock
case
may
stand
for
the
proposition
although
my
brother
from
illinois
disputes
this
that
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy
is
a
fundamental
right
safeguarded
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
case.
the
constitution
of
new
jersey
as
well
as
the
fifth
amendment
bar
a
retrial
after
acquittal
for
the
same
offense.
william
hoag
was
--
was
tried
and
acquitted
of
the
crime
of
robbing
one
cascio,
one
capezzuto,
and
one
galiardo.
he
was
then
tried
and
convicted
for
the
crime
of
robbing
elmer
yager
separate
crimes
occurring
at
the
same
time,
the
same
place
as
part
of
the
tavern
holdup,
but
each
crime
requiring
proof
of
the
elements
of
a
robbery.
that
is,
putting
in
fear
each
of
the
victims,
taking
personal
property
forcibly
from
each
of
the
victims,
and
a
criminal
intent.
new
jersey
in
the
--
in
the
superior
court
appellate
division
and
then
the
supreme
court
applied
the
recognized
common
law
test
for
double
jeopardy.
and
they
found
that
a
retrial
and
a
conviction
were
not
barred
under
those
recognized
tests.
those
are
that
same
evidence
tests
and
the
single
act
test.
now,
the
same
evidence
test
is,
as
most
commonly
stated
is,
with
the
evidence
necessary
for
a
conviction
on
the
second
charge
have
been
sufficient
for
a
conviction
on
the
first
charge.
evidence
of
the
--
of
the
putting
in
fear
of
elmer
yager,
or
the
taking
of
personal
property
from
elmer
yager
would
have
been
without
bearing
and
the
trial
of
the
indictments
for
robbery
of
the
other
three
men.
mr.
david
d.
furman
no
it
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
d.
furman
i
can
--
i
can
offer
an
explanation
off
the
record.
mr.
david
d.
furman
mr.
yager
lives
in
monmouth
county,
new
jersey.
now,
the
other
three
men
live
in
bergen
county.
they
were
available
apparently
at
the
first
grand
jury
proceeding.
elmer
yager
was
not
available
and
was
not
present
at
the
first
grand
jury
proceeding.
now,
that
maybe
the
explanation
why
the
indictments
were
returned
for
robbery
of
--
of
those
three
men
and
not
of
elmer
yager.
elmer
yager
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
no.
that
they
did
not
necessarily
need
him
there,
but
i
offer
that
as
the
only
explanation
i
say.
mr.
david
d.
furman
he
was
available,
of
course,
at
the
first
trial.
he
testified.
but
we
suggest
that
his
testimony
--
when
he
was
an
alleged
victim
in
the
second
trial
was
that
much
more
compelling,
because
he
was
not
a
--
he
was
not
a
complaining
witness
or
an
alleged
victim
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
david
d.
furman
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
the
--
that
the
jury
could
have
found
the
defendant
innocent
of
the
crime
of
robbing
the
other
three
and
found
him
guilty
of
the
crime
of
robbing
yager.
i
think
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
they
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
the
only
contested
issue
at
the
first
trial,
as
has
been
stated
by
my
adversary,
was
whether
elmer
--
whether
hoag
was
present
and
a
participant.
the
only
testimony
that
he
offered
was
testimony
of
an
alibi.
the
state
at
the
first
trial
offered
proof
of
the
substantive
elements
of
robbery
of
the
other
three
men,
but
the
jury
might
--
did
not
necessarily
did
not
have
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
robbery
of
the
other
three
men.
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
prove
all
those
elements
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
here
to
show
that
the
jury
did
not
decide
because
they
thought
that
these
individual
men
were
not
put
in
fear
or
did
not
decide
because
they
--
they
did
not
believe
that
there
was
property
taken
from
those
men,
or
that
they
did
not
believe
that
there
was
a
criminal
intent
as
to
those
men.
there's
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
general
verdict
which
would
--
which
would
show
necessarily
that
that
first
jury
decided
on
the
issue
of
identity.
mr.
david
d.
furman
the
robbery
has
occurred
within
a
short
period
of
time.
there
was
a
tavern
holdup.
galiardo,
one
of
the
first
victims,
that
is
one
of
the
victims
who
--
for
whom
a
robbery
of
whom
the
first
indictments
were
returned
was
the
owner.
and
he
served
also
as
bartender.
two
of
the
other
--
the
two
other
victims
in
the
first
indictments
were
patrons.
mr.
yager
testified
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
stopping
off
there,
that
he
was
returning
from
his
--
from
relatives
in
new
york
city,
and
he
was
returning
to
his
home.
and
from
all
the
testimony,
he
was
--
he
was
robbed
at
approximately
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
place
as
the
other
men.
of
course,
as
far
as
the
other
men
are
concerned,
the
jury
--
the
jury
may
have
disbelieved
that
a
crime
was
committed
as
to
the
other
three.
and
the
jury
may
have
believed
that
the
--
that
the
crime
was
only
committed
as
to
yager.
i
don't
suggest
or
don't
suggest
anything
and
i
would
certainly
have
to
go
into
the
realm
of
--
of
speculation
and
hypothesis.
but
it's
a
--
it's
entirely
possible
that
the
jury
did
not
believe.
for
example,
that
the
other
three
men
were
put
in
fear
or
that
there
was
a
criminal
intent
as
to
the
other
three
men.
mr.
david
d.
furman
the
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
the
evidence
indicated
that
there
were
at
least
three
men
who
entered
the
tavern.
two
of
them
apparently
had
guns,
those
at
--
those
at
the
bar
watching
a
--
a
broadcast
of
a
baseball
game
as
well
as
galiardo
the
owner
were
forced
to
go
to
--
to
go
up
against
the
wall
with
their
hands
up.
they
have
property
taken
from
them.
mr.
david
d.
furman
that's
right.
and
then
they
were
taken
into
an
adjoining
room
and
--
and
compelled
to
--
to
lie
on
the
floor.
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes.
and
they
were
all
tied.
mr.
david
d.
furman
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes.
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes.
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes.
so
it
was
all
in
--
in
a
general
sense
one
robbery
although
in
--
in
new
jersey
as
well
as
i
--
and
i
suppose
other
common
law
jurisdictions
a
crime
of
robbery,
is
the
taking
from
one
person.
and
the
indictments
were
--
were
for
the
crime
of
robbery
of
each
of
these
four
men,
the
three
first
indictments
and
then
the
yager
indictment
which
was
tried
separately.
mr.
david
d.
furman
i
don't
necessarily
say
that,
mr.
justice
black.
we're
dealing
with
this
case
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
which
would
--
which
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
we
say
that
under
the
--
under
these
facts,
where
there
was
a
trial
for
the
robbery
of
--
of
the
three
men,
the
state
offered
proof
of
the
elements
of
robbery.
the
--
the
defendant
offered
proof
only
of
an
alibi
and
there
was
a
general
verdict
of
not
guilty.
but
the
state
can
then
retry
for
the
crime
of
--
of
robbery
of
the
fourth
man.
there's
no
showing
here
of
any
harassment,
any
--
any
deliberate
attempt
to
subject
him
to
--
to
retrials,
any
carelessness
in
the
--
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
--
in
palko
and
brock.
mr.
david
d.
furman
the
only
possible
legal
distinction
would
be
whether
--
the
four
successive
trials
are
not
into
harassment.
that
is
a
possibility
that
is
not
offered
in
this
record.
we
--
we
respectfully
urge.
mr.
david
d.
furman
no,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
furman
well
as
i
understand,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
--
in
the
palko
case
for
example,
mr.
justice
cardozo
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
showing,
that
this
--
that
the
defendant
palko
had
been
carelessly
subjected
to
a
retrial.
there
was
no
showing
that
he
had
been
harassed.
the
same
language
is
--
is
used
in
the
--
in
the
brock
case
of
where
there
was
a
mistrial.
particularly
in
--
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion,
he
says
that
there
is
no
showing
here
of
harassment
a
suggestion
that
if
a
--
if
a
state
court
is
harassing
a
man
by
forcing
him
again
and
again
to
trial
of
--
of
the
same
or
--
or
substantially
closed
facts.
mr.
david
d.
furman
we
would
--
we
would
urge
here
that
--
two
does
not
amount
to
harassment,
that
harassment
would
have
to
be
presented
in
another
record.
there's
no
--
there's
no
indication
here
that
--
that
this
was
other
than
a
regular
procedure
or
a
reasonable
effort
to
enforce
the
criminal
laws.
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes.
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes.
this
--
this
case
certainly
does
not
fall
under
either
the
same
evidence
or
the
single
act
test
of
double
jeopardy.
the
--
the
same
evidence
test,
as
i've
stated
is
inapplicable
because
the
evidence
of
the
--
of
the
robbery
of
yager
was
irrelevant
and
had
no
reference
to
the
charge
of
robbery
of
the
three
other
men.
the
single
act
test
has
been
described
as
an
extension
of
--
of
the
same
evidence
test
or
--
or
an
extension
of
double
jeopardy
beyond
the
same
evidence
test.
where
the
same
act
results
in
two
criminal
offenses,
then
--
then
a
retrial
of
the
second
offense
may
be
barred.
again
plainly
unavailable,
the
robbing
of
yager
was
not
an
--an
essential
ingredient
or
integral
part
of
the
alleged
robbery
of
the
three
other
men.
the
knob
of
this
case
is
in
the
--
in
the
area
of
collateral
estoppel
and
due
process
of
law.
the
theory
or
the
principle
of
facts
necessarily
adjudicated
cannot
be
retried.
the
only
contested
issue
at
the
first
trial
whether
yager
was
--
whether
hoag
was
present.
the
other
issues
necessarily
in
the
case
to
overrule
or
to
reverse
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
--
this
court
must
be
--
must
assign
that
identity
was
determined
at
the
first
trial.
contrary
to
new
jersey
law,
this
court
must
then
decide
that
the
new
jersey
determination
was
so
unreasonable
or
so
at
war
with
--
with
fair
play
and
justice
that
there
was
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
under
new
jersey
laws,
the
majority
decided.
the
general
verdict
is
not
open
for
a
speculative
inquiry
into
which
of
the
several
issues
were
decided
by
the
jury.
a
state
is
never
entitled
to
a
direction
of
a
verdict
in
a
criminal
case.
the
criminal
defendant
has
a
basic
right
that
all
issues
be
decided
by
the
jury.
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
on
the
state
and
never
shifts.
the
acquittal
here
might
have
been
due
to
the
failure
to
establish
the
other
facts
at
the
trial
of
the
cascio,
capezzuto,
and
galiardo
indictments.
the
acquittal
might
have
been
due
to
the
jury's
realization
that
apparently,
at
least,
galiardo
and
one
other
witness
had
retracted
from
a
previous
identification
and
had
recreated
the
problem.
and
that
if
they
could
not
be
believed
in
--
as
they
were
inconsistent
there,
they
perhaps
were
inconsistent
in
other
things.
perhaps
when
they
said
they
were
put
in
fear,
they
cannot
be
believed
on
that.
the
result
here
is
--
is
certainly
inline
with
--
with
other
cases
in
other
courts
which
have
considered
comparable
issues.
now,
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
dunn
case,
for
example,
considered
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
of
law
in
an
erroneous
jury
verdict.
where
the
jury
returned
inconsistent
verdicts,
one
of
acquittal
on
and
one
of
--
of
conviction,
that
the
--
the
criminal
defendant
could
not
get
a
reversal
on
grounds
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
david
d.
furman
certainly
there's
no
case
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
certainly
there's
no
case,
mr.
justice
harlan,
where
this
court
has
--
has
held
or
composed
to
hold
that
--
that
the
states
were
required
to
give
collateral
estoppel
effect
to
--
to
parts
of
--
of
verdicts
in
state
criminal
cases.
now
--
your
question
--
raises
one
possible
answer
if
--
if
you
--
if
the
state
verdict
clearly
showed
a
decision
on
one
issue.
if
the
state
verdict
clearly
to
show
the
decision
on
one
issue
and
there
was
a
retrial
of
that
issue,
then
--
then
a
different
--
and
then
a
different
case
is
presented,
in
this
case.
but
here,
under
state
law,
there
--
there
was
no
determination
of
the
issue
of
identity
at
the
first
trial.
the
general
verdict
might
have
been
put
on
one
of
many
other
grounds
and
we
would
urge
that
this
court
should
--
should
give
in
that
case
at
least
full
effect
to
the
new
jersey
law
which
is
not
unreasonable
and
not
--
and
not
at
war
with
--
with
fundamentals
of
justice.
mr.
david
d.
furman
we'd
certainly
be
in
a
different
legal
position.
mr.
david
d.
furman
because
then
--
mr.
david
d.
furman
--
there
--
then
there
would
be
a
positive
determination
of
one
issue.
mr.
david
d.
furman
i
--
i
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
say
that
the
--
the
new
jersey
judgment
of
conviction
in
that
case
should
be
reversed
by
this
court
but
it
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
furman
well
it's
a
--
i
--
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
in
--
in
very
great
detail
because
i
never
had
experience
with
one.
mr.
david
d.
furman
but
the
rule
does
provide
for
it.
i
think
the
rule
is
not
often
used
but
--
the
rule
does
permit
submission
of
particular
issues
to
the
jury.
mr.
david
d.
furman
yes.
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
case
of
--
of
the
two
cases
cited
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
are
both
worth
the
attention
of
this
court.
one
was
people
versus
rogers,
a
new
york
case
1918
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
how
there
--
how
the
defendant
was
acquitted
of
robbery,
one
man.
his
defense
was
an
alibi.
and
he
was
--
he
was
convicted
for
robbery
of
another
man
at
the
same
time
and
place.
that
was
a
holdup
of
a
store.
two
men
--
the
two
alleged
victims
were
in
fact
brothers,
proprietors
of
the
store.
this
--
the
--
the
conviction
for
attempted
robbery
in
the
second
man
was
sustained.
although
the
--
the
--
again
the
contested
issue
was
the
defendant's
presence.
and
the
--
the
lower
court
said
that
the
verdict
spoke
but
one
thing,
that
the
defendant
was
not
guilty.
the
burton
case
in
--
in
washington
is
substantially
in
the
court.
the
jury
here
could
have
utterly
disregarded
all
evidence
of
alibi
and
yet
have
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
now,
there's
no
res
judicata
effect
on
the
alibi
or
on
the
issue
of
identity.
and
the
opinion
of
the
new
jersey
court
apparently
inline
with
--
with
the
new
york
and
washington
decisions.
the
cases
of
sealfon
versus
united
states
and
--
and
the
emich
motors
case
are
cited,
both
cases
arising
in
federal
courts.
both
cases
suggested
by
the
petitioner
hoag
showed
that
this
court
is
prepared
to
examine
into
a
general
verdict
and
decide
which
of
several
issues
have
been
determined.
as
we
read
those
cases
they
don't
hold
that.
this
--
the
sealfon
case
was
a
--
was
on
a
--
on
a
charge
a
fourth
commission
of
the
crime
of
--
of
defrauding
the
government.
there's
been
a
prior
acquittal
on
a
charge
of
--
of
conspiracy
to
commit
the
offense.
and
by
established
law
of
conspiracy
to
commit
the
offense
and
the
substantive
offense
itself
were
separate
and
independent
offenses.
mr.
justice
douglas
--
analyzing
the
--
the
record
in
the
two
trials
found
that
the
--
that
the
only
proof,
the
only
evidence
upon
which
the
defendant
could
have
been
convicted
at
either
trial
was
the
evidence
of
the
writing
of
a
letter.
now
the
letter
is
something
to
the
effect
that
some
of
--
some
of
the
syrups
manufactured
by
or
some
of
the
syrups
in
which
sealfon
dealt
were
being
sold
to
the
brooklyn
navy
yard.
and
he
--
he
--
the
--
the
letter
was
the
only
--
was
the
only
testimony
or
the
only
proof
either
of
a
conspiracy
or
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
in
defrauding
the
government.
and
there
because
there
was
an
identity
that
the
--
the
substantive
act
asserted
as
a
criminal
act
and
both
charges
was
identically
the
same
and
the
proof
had
been
before
the
first
jury
and
the
first
jury
had
acquitted,
this
court
ruled
that
a
second
--
that
a
conviction
on
the
substantive
offense
had
to
be
reversed.
that
it
was
contrary
to
due
process
of
law.
the
emich
motors
case
is
a
--
is
a
case
considering
the
effect
in
the
civil
proceeding
of
a
criminal
conviction
under
the
clayton
act.
and
the
statute
provides
that
the
criminal
conviction
shall
have
--
shall
have
prima
facie
effect
in
the
--
in
a
subsequent
civil
--
civil
proceeding
in
establishing
the
general
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade.
and
that's
--
that's
just
about
the
--
the
holding
of
this
court
--
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
could
--
could
put
in
evidence
how
that
general
conspiracy
affected
him
and
of
his
particular
damages
and
to
that
extent
the
--
the
judgment.
in
the
first
criminal
case
was
given
a
res
judicata
effect
by
statute.
the
--
the
two
dangers
which
are
sometimes
cited
--
calling
for
the
protection
against
double
jeopardy
or
the
danger
of
harassment
or
the
danger
of
erroneous
conviction.
we
--
we
respectfully
urge
that
there's
no
showing
of
any
harassment
here.
in
the
louisiana
electric
chair
case,
the
--
the
lack
of
malice
was
presumed
by
this
court.
i
cannot,
without
going
outside
the
record,
give
any
explanation
for
the
pleasure
to
indict
on
the
charge
of
robbery
of
yager
at
the
first
trial
and
respond
in
the
first
instance.
in
response
to
questions
i
have
pointed
out
that
yager
was
not
a
witness
in
the
first
grand
jury
proceeding.
but
certainly,
the
--
the
regularity
and
--
and
lack
of
malice
of
the
state
should
not
be
questioned
unless
there
is
some
affirmative
showing
and
there
is
no
such
affirmative
showing
here.
now,
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
danger
of
an
erroneous
conviction
although
this
defendant
pleaded
not
guilty,
he
has
never
attacked
the
fairness
of
the
second
trial
as
such
or
the
validity
of
that
conviction.
there
is
no
plea
in
new
jersey
of
collateral
estoppel.
now,
the
plea
is
available
in
criminal
cases
are
guilty,
not
guilty,
nolo
contendere,
utraque
acquit
and
utraque
convict.
the
--
the
lack
of
a
plea
of
collateral
estoppel
is
--
is
perhaps
indicative
of
--
of
new
jersey
law,
substantive
law.
the
rules
of
joinder
in
new
jersey
are
discretionary.
it's
not
mandatory.
that
where
there
is
one
criminal
transaction
perhaps
in
the
sense
that
mr.
justice
black
had
used
the
term,
that
all
indictments
are
--
are
tried
--
are
joined
together
for
trial.
certainly
if
this
court
should
reverse
here
--
it
restricts
the
prosecutor
in
many
cases
where
there
is
a
transaction
involving
--
involving
multiple
crimes
against
several
people
and
one
or
more
of
the
complaining
witnesses
are
not
available
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
first
trial
or
as
the
--
as
the
case
is
ready
for
the
first
trial.
shall
the
prosecutor
hold
up
and
not
bring
the
--
the
other
indictments
to
trial
or
shall
he
wait
on
the
possibility
that
the
--
the
other
complaining
witness
returns.
any
--
any
reading
of
the
--
of
the
transfers
of
the
two
trials
of
william
hoag
will
lead
to
the
conclusion
certainly
that
--
that
elmer
yager
had
--
had
a
more
detailed
recollection
of
the
events.
he
testified
in
more
detail.
the
state
suggests
that
he
testified
more
accurately.
but
he
--
he
certainly
was
an
impressive
witness.
and
at
the
second
trial
when
the
--
when
the
jury
realized
that
he
was
the
--
that
he
was
the
victim,
he
was
--
perhaps
more
--
more
impressive
than
in
the
earlier
trial
where
he
was
not
one
of
those
for
who
--
for
whose
robbery
and
indictment
was
being
tried.
as
--
as
an
additional
point,
the
petitioner
hoag
has
--
has
raised
the
--
the
lack
of
a
speedy
trial.
now
he
had
a
--
he
had
a
remedy
under
new
jersey
practice,
he
could
have
--
he
could
have
moved
to
fix
a
date
for
trial.
never
did
that.
i
don't
see
how
he
can
contend
for
--
contend
that
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law.
the
lack
of
a
speed
trial
is
--
is
it
attributable
first,
he
was
a
fugitive
for
about
a
year
from
the
time
of
the
tavern
holdup
until
--
that
was
in
1950,
until
the
fall
of
1951.
second,
after
his
acquittal
on
the
charges
of
robbery
of
the
other
three
men,
he
was
returned
to
new
york
for
incarceration.
he
was
there
for
two
years.
he
was
brought
back
to
bergen
county.
he
was
unable
to
raise
bail.
he
was
confined
in
jail
during
the
summer
months
when
the
court
was
not
sitting
for
criminal
trials.
he
had
his
remedy.
the
remedy
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
we
--
we
contend
that
he
failed
to
avail
himself
for
that
remedy
and
he
was
not
denied
due
process
of
law
in
the
federal
sense.
the
--
the
principle
of
--
of
unassailability
of
the
general
verdict
established
in
new
jersey
in
accordance
with
other
common
law
jurisdictions
does
not
deny
the
fundamental
essentials
of
--
of
a
fair
trial.
the
fourteenth
amendment
exacts
from
the
state's
fair
dealing
and
justice
and
prosecution
of
criminal
defendants.
that
was
accorded
here
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
should
be
sustained.
mr.
david
d.
furman
thank
you.
