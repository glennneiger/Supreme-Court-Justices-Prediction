justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
that
is
just
an
affidavit
of
the
grandfather
the
support
of
the
son's
position
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he's
never
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
has
been
an
order
of
the
new
york
court
the
records
of
the
grandfather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
require
the
grandfather
to
do
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
contention
in
this
case
maybe
--
is
that
--
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
could
have
been
given
finding
effect
by
a
north
carolina
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
against
the
grandfather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
make
him
--
how
do
you
bring
that
about
if
he
is
not
a
party
to
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
north
carolina
exercised
a
parents
(inaudible)
jurisdiction--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
trial
was
in
north
carolina.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
the
custody
has
to
originate
from
new
york
to
order
a
subpoena?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
mean
that
the
north
carolina
decree
cannot
be
construed?
i
understand
that
the
father
in
fact
is
in
the
navy
all
the
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
child
has
been
brought
up
by
the
grandparents
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
record
show,
the
child
never
seen
his
father.
isn't
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
mean
never
but
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
since
the
grandparents
have
had
the
child.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
far
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
the
father
has
not
been
around.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
the
north
carolina
decree
can
be
interpreted
since
the
award
in
this
instance
without
qualification
to
the
grandparents,
am
i
not
correct
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
north
carolina
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
without
qualification
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
awarded
the
child
to
the
grandparents.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
you
suppose
that
might
have
been
an
award.
it
could
be
interpreted
as
an
award
to
the
grandparents
independent
of
any
rights
to
the
parents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
you
are
faced
with
a
problem
that
parent's
patriotic
exercise
by
the
north
carolina
courts
maybe
an
independent
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suppose
in
this
instance,
the
grandparents
had
not
been
on
good
terms
with
their
son,
if
the
child
was
actually
in
north
carolina
living
with
the
grandparents
as
i
understand
it.
i
suppose
the
type
of
this
new
york
proceeding
that
new
york
--
it's
been
made
awarding
custody
to
the
father
of
the
child
and
the
grandparents
got
into
a
north
carolina
court
and
got
an
independent
award
for
themselves.
was
the
north
carolina
court
would
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
for
the
new
york
case?
