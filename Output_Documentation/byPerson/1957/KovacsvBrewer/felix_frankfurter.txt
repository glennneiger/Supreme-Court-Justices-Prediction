justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that's
what
new
york
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
be
on
the
basis
that
north
carolina
--
that
the
determination
by
the
new
york
court
of
the
well-being
of
the
--
the
proper
--
proper
regard
to
the
well-being
of
the
child,
physically
resident
in
north
carolina
is
an
adjudication
--
i
don't
know
what
in
personam
which
another
full
page
(inaudible)
must
be
respect
by
north
carolina.
that's
your
case,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
that
each
member
of
the
court
doesn't
so
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you'll
suggest
that
i
re-read
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
here,
a
new
york
court
originally
had
the
disposition
of
a
child.
they
thought
the
welfare
of
the
child
required
that
it'd
be
handed
over
to
the
grandfather
who
i
suppose
could
not
have
been
compelled
to
take
charge
of
this
child.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nevertheless,
in
--
in
the
human
disposition
of
the
situation,
a
child
goes
and
lived
with
the
grandparents
and
has
lived
how
many
years
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
four
years.
and
the
child
is
there
and
has
been
there.
and
now
because
another
new
york
judge
several
years
later
thinks
that
she
would
make
a
good
--
what
shall
i
say?
tender
and
desirable
mother
and
such
a
judge,
i
take
it
for
granted,
is
allowed
to
make
that
judgment.
if
a
child
isn't
there
and
he
does
not
know
anything
about
it
at
a
distance,
that
determination
that's
controlling
upon
north
carolina
in
theory
and
law
as
though
these
were
a
controversy
about
a
negotiable
instrument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
it
to
be
accurate
whether
it's
extreme
or
not,
there's
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
to
you
that
may
against
anderson
was
made
possible
by
my
concurrence
and
my
special
detailed
explanation
of
what
i
understand
the
opinion
to
be
because
otherwise,
whatever
may
and
anderson
and
sort
of
my
concurrence
had
the
agreement
of
only
four
members
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
arguing
that
as
to
that
question.
i'm
trying
to
say
that
i
must
decide
your
way
because
of
may
and
anderson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
that
is
not
what
made
a
court
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
ground.
that
is
not
the
way
i
understood
what
the
opinion
of
my
brother
(inaudible)
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you
--
you
may
not
have
the
agreement
of
the
court
with
you
as
new
proposition.
i'm
saying
to
you
that
you
cannot
tell
us
that
would
be
an
answer
to
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
can
quote
it
but
all
i'm
saying
is
there
are
only
four
people
who
agreed
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
(c)
--
or
(c)
that
there's
no
reason
for
changing
the
welfare
--
the
conditions
of
welfare
under
which
the
child
live.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
new
york
could
do
that
the
next
day
after
this
decree,
couldn't
it?
new
york
itself
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
north
carolina
can't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
change
circumstances
meaning
the
judgment
of
one
estimable
new
york
judge
predicts
on
the
whole
--
mrs.
kovacs
isn't
good
a
thing
for
the
child
as
a
mother
ought
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
only
ground.
that's
right.
and
the
north
carolina
court
said,
we
think
this
--
this
child
is
morally
and
emotionally
so
well
sheltered
where
he
is
if
we
ought
not
to
serve
a
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
--
as
i
recall
that,
i
think
i
wrote
something
there
too
and
the
whole
point
of
that
case
was
that
you're
dealing
--
when
you're
dealing
with
custody,
you're
dealing
with
something
very
different
from
a
negotiable
instance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
get
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
here
--
but
here,
new
york
is
setting
aside
the
north
carolina
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
point
is,
isn't
it
true
that
the
child
is
--
there's
no
question
--
is
there
any
question
that
the
child's
well
--
being
has
been
preserved
during
these
four
years
and
that
will
be
disturbed
on
the
theory
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
north
carolina
must
now
bow
to
new
york
although
the
child
is
before
the
judges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
child
before
the
new
york
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
quote
it
to
you
why
it
is
relevant
to
my
mind?
it
isn't
merely
a
question
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
judge
acted
but
what
legal
rule,
what
imperative
requirement
we
should
make
to
determination
by
distant
tribunal
abstractly
considering
the
question
without
having
available
the
kind
of
evidence
in
a
normal
instance,
determine
such
a
judgment.
now,
the
cases
to
which
i
--
you
refer,
i
read
a
lot
of
them.
they
deal
with
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
whether
a
child
of
eight
years
or
nine
years
or
six
years
or
12
years
can
give
evidence
on
what
basis
the
court
can
act.
the
cases
are
full
of
that
kind
of
thought.
but
we're
not
considering
a
legal
question
which
you're
tendering
quite
right
now
that
abstractly
considered
because
the
new
york
district
court,
having
no
evidence
before
except
the
quality
of
the
mother
now
that
she's
remarried
to
change
the
condition
in
which
the
child
has
been
in
the
last
four
years
as
a
constitutional
doctrine.
that's
what
you're
tendering,
right?
aren't
you?
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
it
a
constitutional
doctrine
you're
tendering?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
in
order
to
determine
a
constitutional
question,
we
are
not
to
determine
it
in
abstract
(inaudible).
a
legal
question
that
the
child
is
like
a
negotiable
instance
like
a
bill
of
exchange
and
since
the
bill
of
exchange
determines
in
new
york
and
binds
other
state,
ergo,
a
determination
regarding
the
child
binds
all
the
other
state.
i'm
challenging
the
basis
on
which
we
are
asked
to
pronounce
such
a
constitutional
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
(inaudible)
