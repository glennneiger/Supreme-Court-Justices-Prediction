mr.
louis
haimoff
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
north
--
north
carolina.
the
judgment
involved
is
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
in
north
carolina
which
denied
the
petition
of
the
petitioner
here,
mrs.
kovacs,
to
enforce
in
north
carolina
an
award
of
the
new
york
court
which
had
--
which
had
awarded
to
her
the
custody
of
her
child.
the
child
was
then
eight
years
of
age,
a
little
girl.
the
case
comes
here
on
the
following
facts.
the
parties
were
married
originally
in
new
york
where
they
resided.
the
marriage
occurred
in
1945.
the
child
was
born
in
new
york
in
1946.
in
1950,
the
husband
brought
an
action
against
the
wife
for
divorce
in
new
york
and
after
a
trial,
judgment
was
rendered
in
favor
of
the
husband
against
the
wife.
with
respect
to
custody,
the
court
held
that
while
it
would
not
have
ordinarily
taken
the
child
from
his
mother
really
by
reason
of
the
misconduct
which
had
been
found
in
the
case,
nevertheless,
the
court
did
so
for
the
reason
that
he
found
that
the
mother's
financial
situation
and
circumstances
with
such
as
not
to
promote
the
interest
and
welfare
of
the
child.
there
was
another
problem
with
respect
to
custody
because
the
husband
was
then
in
the
navy
and
has
been
throughout
this
proceeding.
mr.
louis
haimoff
in
the
navy.
he
was
enlisted,
a
man
in
the
navy.
mr.
louis
haimoff
if
he
is,
your
honor,
in
the
navy.
for
that
reason,
the
court
ultimately
decided
to
award
the
custody
of
the
child
to
the
paternal
grandfather
who
was
a
resident
of
north
carolina.
and
accordingly
the
child,
he
went
to
north
carolina
and
remained
there
with
her
grandfather.
mr.
louis
haimoff
so
far,
as
the
record
is
concerned,
yes
your
honor.
in
1951
and
again
in
1952,
mrs.
kovacs
made
application
to
the
supreme
court
in
new
york
to
modify
the
order
which
has
been
made
and
both
of
these
applications
were
denied.
the
court
presumably
finding
that
there
has
been
no
sufficient
change
in
her
circumstances
as
to
warrant
any
change
of
custody.
in
1954,
however,
she
married
joseph
kovacs
who
has
been
named
as
correspondent
in
the
original
divorce
action
and
she
went
to
live
with
him
in
riverdale,
new
york.
based
upon
this
change
in
her
circumstances,
a
new
application
was
made,
came
on
to
be
heard,
the
brewers,
the
grandfather,
the
father
and
son
appeared
by
counsel
submitted
affidavits
and
upon
the
basis
of
the
evidence
submitted,
the
court
modified
its
earlier
order
and
awarded
custody
of
the
child
to
mrs.kovacs.
with
this
order,
the
petitioner
here
attempted
to
obtain
custody
of
the
child.
the
brewers
however
refused
voluntarily
to
surrender
the
child.
mr.
louis
haimoff
the
brewer
--
both
of
them.
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
the
proceeding
was
a
motion
in
the
divorce
action
so
that
brewer,
jr.,
the
plaintiff
appeared
by
counsel
submitted
an
affidavit
and
his
father
who
had
actual
custody
of
the
child
did
not
appear
by
counsel
but
did
submitted
an
affidavit
in
opposition
to
the
application
to
modify
the
custody
award.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
way,
the
motion,
the
application
of
mrs.
kovacs
was
by
motion
in
the
divorce
action.
in
other
words,
if
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
grandfather
was
added
as
another
party,
that
is
not
so.
mr.
louis
haimoff
he
has
never
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
the
order
of
the
new
york
court
was
in
fact
directed
to
the
grandfather
but
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
it
did
require
the
grandfather
to
surrender
custody
of
the
child
since
the
order
of
the
supreme
court
originally
had
awarded
custody
of
the
child
to
the
grandfather.
i
think
possibly,
the
legal
analysis
of
that
situation
is
that
the
grandfather
is
acting
pursuant
to
court
order
as
agent
of
the
father,
brewer,
jr.,
who
was
in
the
navy
taking
care
of
the
child
temporarily
pending
his
service
in
the
navy.
if
he
was
--
i
think
the
father
ever
left
the
navy,
the
custody
of
the
child
would
then
be
turned
over
to
him.
but
that
never
happened.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
louis
haimoff
at
that
time
--
that's
correct,
your
honor,
which
was
the
point
of
the
north
carolina
decision.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
with
the
grandfather.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
about
the
decree
that
contain
a
reference
to
north
carolina.
but
since
it
had
appeared
that
the
grandfather
lived
in
north
carolina,
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
inference
from
the
decree.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
in
north
carolina.
mr.
louis
haimoff
except
to
the
extent
that
he
became
a
party
in
legal
theory
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
his
custody
depended
upon
the
right
of
the
child's
father
to
custody
but
in
no
other
way.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
that
your
honor
makes
now
i
see
is
this.
how
could
the
court
have
awarded
custody
to
the
grandfather
if
the
grandfather
was
not
a
party
to
the
proceeding?
mr.
louis
haimoff
no?
mr.
louis
haimoff
he
made
no
appearance
unless
his
submission
of
an
affidavit
is
construed
to
be
tantamount
to
an
appearance.
other
than
that,
he
may
not.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
materially
but
that's
our
position.
may
i
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor,
well
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
the
grandfather's
right
to
custody
of
the
child
has
no
origin.
it
has
no
justificationit
has
no
basis
except
in
the
order
of
the
new
york
court.
once
you
remove
that
basis
for
the
custody
of
the
child
with
the
grandfather,
then
he
has
no
right
to
it.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i'm
coming
to
that,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
that's
exactly
the
question
i
was
presented.
mr.
louis
haimoff
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
based
upon
the
idea
of
a
notion
that
the
state
has
acted
as
parents
patriotic,
i
consider
it
applies
only
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
parent
or
were
the
rights
of
a
parents
are
being
adjudicated.
the
point
of
this
whole
appeal
is
that
what
we
have
involved
here
is
an
adjudication
of
the
right
of
the
parents
as
between
the
parents
to
the
custody
of
the
child.
now,
the
net
effect
of
the
new
york
decision
was
to
award
the
custody
of
the
child
to
the
father.
well
the
reasons
which
i
have
pointed
out,
the
court
considered
it
appropriate
to
send
the
child
to
the
father's
father
or
the
child's
grandfather
in
north
carolina.
he
couldn't
send
the
child
to
the
navy.
mr.
louis
haimoff
over
the
parties.
mr.
louis
haimoff
parents,
both
parents
in
our
view
is
what
basic
and
necessary
and
nothing
else
is
necessary.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
refer
to
the
study
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
so
far
as
this
record
shows
--
well,
i
don't
think
that's
true,
if
your
honor
please
because
the
divorce
proceeding
was
brought
in
1951
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
since
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
since.
mr.
louis
haimoff
so
far
as
this
--
well,
that
isn't
true
either,
if
your
honor
please
because
there
were
affidavits
in
the
case
which
was
submitted
which
indicate
the
father's
great
love
for
his
child
and
the
fact
that
he
has
seen
the
child
from
time
to
time
on
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
in
new
york
or
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
that
is
possible
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
north
carolina
had
any
right
to
do
it
in
view
of
the
prior
judgment
of
the
new
york
court.
mr.
louis
haimoff
it
is
--
it
is
an
independent
basis
but
it's
not
applicable
here.
mr.
louis
haimoff
that's
--
that's
our
view.
mr.
louis
haimoff
no,
they
would
not.
in
other
words,
there's
no
question
about
the
power,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
north
carolina
court,
act
upon
the
basis
of
circumstances
which
occurred
subsequent
to
the
entry
of
the
new
--
of
the
new
york
decree.
there's
no
question
about
that
at
all.
the
only
point
that
we
make
here
is
that
north
carolina
has
no
right
to
award
custody
of
the
child
to
the
grandfather
because
judge
stevens
in
north
carolina
disagreed
with
judge
(inaudible)
in
new
york
as
to
where
the
child
wanted
to
be
on
the
same
fact.
that's
basically
our
position.
mr.
louis
haimoff
that's
our
position.
and
our
position
further
is
that
that
decision
has
already
been
made
by
this
court
in
may
against
anderson.
in
other
words
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
may
i
suggest
that
the
reasons
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
no,
you're
not
--
i
will
not
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
there
is
no
question.
that
has
been
raised
and
i've
cited
in
the
brief
several
new
york
case
which
squarely
make
that
--
take
that
holding
and
that
is
that
the
presence
of
the
child
is
not
necessary
to
a
jurisdiction
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basis
and
principle
of
an
adjudication
of
custody
which
was
made
clear,
i
believe
at
least,
and
may
against
anderson
makes
it
conclusive
that
a
custody
adjudication
has
now
been
held
to
be
a
proceeding
and
in
personam
and
not
a
proceeding
in
rem
and
that
therefore
the
presence
of
the
child
is
--
is
irrelevant
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
either
that
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
does
not
apply
to
custody
cases
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
louis
haimoff
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
haimoff
four
years.
mr.
louis
haimoff
four
years.
mr.
louis
haimoff
exactly.
now
may
i
--
may
i
add
to
that,
if
your
honor
please
that
if
--
if
--
if
that
statement
is
not
correct
although
it
sounds
extreme
as
it
was
put
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
it
is
accurate.
(voice
overlap)
and
it
is
a
necessary
result
of
the
adjudication
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
may
against
anderson
which
was
to
the
effect
that
a
proceeding
with
respect
to
custody
is
a
proceeding
in
personam.
in
other
words,
if
you
--
if
you
are
dealing
with
the
rights
of
individuals
with
respect
to
money
or
with
respect
to
children,
and
if
you
hold
that
personal
service
on
both
--
on
both
parents,
it
is
necessary.
in
order
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction,
you
have
in
effect
rule
that
in
custody
cases,
no
distinction
is
to
be
drawn.
and
that
once
you
have
defined
the
rights
of
the
parents,
once
you
have
held
that
we
are
concerned
in
custody
matters
with
the
rights
of
the
parents
then
it
follows
that
you
are
dealing
with
the
personal
rights
of
individuals,
the
mother
and
the
father
and
that
the
presence
of
the
child
or
the
physical
whereabouts
of
the
child
is
irrelevant.
now,
the
fact
that
the
child
is
not
present
in
court
and
the
fact
that
the
judge
has
no
opportunity,
let
us
say,
to
confer
with
the
child,
ought
not
to
make
a
difference
unless
you
are
going
to
establish
a
different
rule
for
an
infant
or
for
a
grown
child.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
--
i
am
not
prepared,
if
your
honor
please.
i
mean
i
did
not
prepare
to
reargue
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
custody
proceeding
or
to
be
deemed
to
be
a
proceeding
in
rem
or
in
personam.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
don't
think
that
that
is
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
decision
has
to
ought
to
be
this
way
because
of
a
fact
that
a
decision
had
to
be
made
as
to
whether
or
not
in
custody
cases,
you
could
deprive
the
mother
or
the
father
of
his
or
her
rights
to
custody
in
his
absence.
any
party
so
to
speak.
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
now
then
assume
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
i
don't
know
what
i
would
say
of
any
purpose
by
quoting
the
language
from
may
against
anderson
which
i
rely
upon.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
see
your
honor.
mr.
louis
haimoff
they
are
in
a
very
definite
sense
in
which
i
assume
your
honor
means
that
term,
yes.
mr.
louis
haimoff
subject
to
change.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
say
that
north
--
north
carolina
would
not
--
would
have
no
right
to
fight
otherwise
unless
it
did
so
on
the
basis
of
a
fact,
unless
it
did
so
on
either
one
of
two
basis
(a)
fact
which
had
occurred
since
the
rendition
of
the
new
york
award
or
(b),
upon
the
basis
of
facts
which
for
one
reason
or
another
had
not
been
presented
to
the
new
york
court.
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
that's
amounts
to
a
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
yes
it
could.
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
but
new
york
court
--
but
the
new
york
court
could
not
except
on
the
basis
of
changed
circumstances.
in
other
words
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well
that
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
i
would
like
--
perhaps
i
want
at
this
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
refer
to
--
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
halvey
case
where
the
statement
was
made
that
the
--
where
the
statement
was
made
after
florida
decree
or
to
be
binding
in
new
york
and
that
the
new
york
court
ought
not
to
change
the
florida
decree
simply
because
the
new
york
court
disagreed
with
the
florida
decision.
perhaps
i
could
read
the
language
because
it's
exactly
the
point
i
have
in
mind.
mr.
louis
haimoff
that
is
true
in
a
sense
your
honor.
the
language
i
have
in
mind
is
this.
the
child's
welfare
must
be
the
controlling
consideration.
whenever
a
court
which
can
actually
lay
hold
of
a
child
is
appealed
to
on
behalf
of
the
child,
there's
no
question
about
that.
short
of
that,
a
valid
custodial
decree
by
florida
could
not
be
set
aside
simply
because
a
new
york
court,
on
independent
consideration,
has
its
own
view
of
what
custody
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
louis
haimoff
in
other
words,
it's
my
--
if
the
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well
that's
--
that
i
think
is
not
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
new
york
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
we
don't
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
we
don't
agree
with
that,
if
your
honor
please.
and
the
--
and
the
new
york
court
which
originally
made
the
order,
awarding
custody
to
the
grandfather
has
now
also
reconsidered
its
decision
and
it's
in
line
with
the
normal
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
well,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that,
if
i
may
your
honor
as
to
whether
or
not
the
child
was
before
the
new
york
court.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
not
to
--
well
not
to
confuse
but
link
together
at
the
same
time
the
question
as
to
the
legal
right
of
the
court
to
make
decision
and
the
further
question
as
to
whether
we
agree
with
it
or
whether
it
acted
on
--
on
insufficient
evidence.
in
other
words,
the
question
it
seems
to
me
that
is
now
being
raised
is
how
can
a
court
make
a
decision
with
respect
to
custody
unless
the
child
is
in
court?
well
now,
it
very
often
happens
that
such
orders
are
made
and
the
child
is
not
in
court.
the
child
maybe
away
in
school.
this
is
a
matter
for
the
judge
to
--
to
determine
but
we
are
not
concerned
with
that
question.
that's
dealing
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
the
new
york
court
that
might
be
a
matter
that
could
be
presented
on
appeal.
mr.
brewer,
jr.
could
have
taken
an
appeal
in
new
york
and
urge
it.
how
could
this
new
york
court
have
changed
the
decision
that
was
formerly
made?
the
child
wasn't
even
here.
this
is
a
matter
that's
addressed,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
correctness
of
the
decision
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
--
not
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
to
make
it.
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
don't
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
with
all
due
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
i
am
tendering
a
constitutional
doctrine
but
not
that
one
which
it
seems
to
me
still
addressed
to
the
question
of
the
correctness
of
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court.
i'm
not
dealing
with
that.
i'm
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
make
that
decision
and
it
seems
to
me
that
does
not
depend
and
i
see
no
authority
for
it
anywhere
on
the
fact
that
the
child
happens
to
be
physically
within
the
state.
are
we
dealing
now
with
physical
presence,
residence
or
domicile?
mr.
louis
haimoff
the
only
--
the
answer
that
i
would
like
to
make
to
that
is
this,
that
we
are
dealing
in
custody
cases
with
the
rights
of
the
parents.
mr.
louis
haimoff
this
i
believe
to
be
the
necessary
implication
of
may
against
anderson
and
i
believe
that
to
be
crucial
to
the
decision
of
this
question.
mr.
louis
haimoff
the
fact
that
a
resolution
of
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
parents
to
the
custody
of
the
child
depends
or
turns
upon
the
welfare
of
the
children.
it
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
what
is
basically
being
passed
upon
or
adjudicated
is
the
right
of
either
parents
to
the
custody,
care,
management
and
companionship
of
the
child.
mr.
louis
haimoff
they
don't
own
them,
that
is
true
but
they
are
legal
rights
and
all
legal
rights,
all
legal
--
i
mean
in
other
words,
there
is
nothing
in
the
united
states
constitution
in
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
which
says
that
all
judgments
except
judgments
in
custody
matters
must
be
respected
by
other
states.
it
says
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
no
state
does
but
there
is
an
established
--
but
the
fact
--
but
the
proposition
which
is
that
a
court
may
modify
its
earlier
decision
assumes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
have
made
its
earlier
decision
and
acts
upon
the
basis
of
evidence
of
--
of
facts
which
have
occurred
since
the
rendition
of
the
early
adjustment.
there
is
no
question
that
the
new
york
court
as
in
the
halvey
case
which
presented
that
situation.
the
new
york
court
there
on
the
basis
of
fact
which
have
not
been
presented,
require
the
court
modify
the
acquired
decision
and
this
court
sustained
the
action
of
the
florida
--
of
the
new
york
court
on
the
very
theory
that
what
florida
could
do,
new
york
could
do.
so
we
--
that
question
is
not
presented
here
because
that
question
assumes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
make
the
original
--
and
also
assume
since
the
courts
talk
in
terms
of
facts
not
previously
presented
and
in
terms
of
changed
circumstances
also
assume
that
in
the
absence
of
those
things,
in
the
absence
of
changed
circumstances,
in
the
absence
of
evidence
which
had
not
been
presented
to
the
prior
courts
that
--
that
award
would
be
binding
and
ought
to
be
respected
because
otherwise,
judicial
proceedings
with
respect
to
custody
matters
are
excluded
or
excised
from
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
as
if
there
has
been
a
specific
exception
of
that
type
of
judgment.
now
--
mr.
louis
haimoff
there
are
two
types
of
jurisdiction
in
a
state
where
the
child
is
physically
located.
there
is
the
jurisdiction
which
has
been
referred
to
which
was
applied
in
the
halvey
case
based
upon
as
i
said
the
evidence
not
submitted
or
upon
other
facts.
there
is
also
another
type
of
jurisdiction
which
is
entirely
independent
of
the
jurisdiction
and
we
have
thus
far
have
been
talking
about
which
has
to
do
with
a
divorce
proceeding
and
the
incidental
power
of
the
court
which
is
passing
upon
a
divorce
to
make
awards
with
respect
to
alimony
and
custody.
there
is
another
jurisdiction
which
was
set
forth
in
the
finley
case
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
was
actually
the
origin
of
the
north
carolina
rule
about
the
reece.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
parties
could
not
bring
into
the
new
york
court
a
dispute
which
had
to
do
with
their
respective
claims
to
the
custody
of
the
children
without
at
the
same
time
bringing
--
unless
there
were
a
divorce
action.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
independent
proceeding
to
define
the
rights
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
the
child.
the
court
did
say
however
that
the
court
--
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
jurisdiction
as
parent's
patriot
to
take
care
of
the
child
if
the
welfare
of
the
child
requires
it.
but
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
nothing
in
that
case
to
show
that
this
was
a
kind
of
an
emergency
situation
which
required
the
court
to
intervene
for
the
benefit
of
the
child.
now,
that
is
the
jurisdiction
and
that
would
apply
whether
there
are
no
parents.
it
applies
to
orphans,
to
abandoned
children,
it
has
nothing
to
do
in
my
opinion
where
the
situation
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
divorce
suit,
where
the
court
and
the
divorce
action
made
an
award
with
respect
to
custody
and
where
that
court
subsequently
modifies
it
upon
the
appearance
of
the
parties.
it
will
be
entirely
different
of
course
that
the
parties
had
not
appeared.
based
upon
the
appearance
of
the
parties
and
then
another
court
supposing
the
following
day
on
the
same
facts
says,
“well,
we
don't
agree
with
you
new
york
supreme
court
judge.
we
have
our
own
view
as
to
what
custody
would
be
appropriate.”
i
don't
think
that
--
i
mean
either
--
either
i
say
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
applies
the
custody
proceedings
or
it
does
not.
if
it
does
apply,
then
this
judgment
has
to
be
reversed.
