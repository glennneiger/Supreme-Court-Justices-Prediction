are
public
officials
eligible
to
serve
as
jury
commissioner,
as
sheriffs,
et
cetera?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
this
instance,
were
any
of
the
jury
commissioners
public
officials?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
the
jury
commissioners
for
a
given
term
pick
the
jury
panels?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
do
they
do
that
within
a
few
days
before
a
term?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
large
is
the
panel
usually?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
does
that
panel,
a
grand
jury
as
well
as
the
petit
jury
is
picked
from
that
panel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
are
no
qualifications
whatever
that
guides
the
jury
commissioners
in
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
a
statutory
requirement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
only
one
in
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
in
that
connection
are
you
suggesting
that
these
qualifications
in
206
all
add
up
to
one
thing?
this
has
good
character,
approved
integrity,
sound
judgment
and
reasonable
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
i
thought
you
told
me
earlier
that
the
only
qualification
is
good
moral
character,
and
this
indicates
that,
in
words
at
least
there
are
four
requisites,
good
character,
approved
integrity,
sound
judgment
and
reasonable
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
they
ought
--
add
up
to
the
one
thing
or
are
they
four
separate
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
didn't
he
tell
us
--
didn't
he
tell
us
that
it
was
represented
to
him,
that
there
was
no
record
except
the
one
that
he
did
get.
it
wasn't
until
later
that
it
was
disclosed
and
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
somehow
learned
that
there
was
a
--
that
there
were
other
records.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
