mr.
wiley
a.
branton
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
defendant
frank
andrew
payne
is
or
rather
was
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
commission
of
the
crime
a
19-year-old
negro
youth,
was
tried
for
a
charge
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
in
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county,
arkansas.
he
was
convicted
of
that
crime
in
jefferson
county,
took
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
where
the
conviction
was
affirmed
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
to
the
petitioner
to
hear
or
to
determine
two
points
raised
in
the
petition.
one,
whether
or
not
members
of
the
negro
race
were
systematically
excluded
or
their
number
limited
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
panel
and
of
the
jury
commission.
and
two
whether
the
petitioner's
alleged
confession
was
introduced
into
evidence
after
the
same
had
been
illegally
and
unlawfully
secured
from
him.
i
should
like
to
argue
those
two
points
in
the
order
of
that
certiorari
was
granted,
namely
beginning
with
the
filing
of
our
motion
to
quash
the
then
panel
on
the
grounds
of
racial
discrimination.
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
the
motion
which
was
filed
in
the
lower
court,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
negro,
that
he
was
charged
with
the
slaying
of
an
elderly
white
man
and
that
he
was
tried
before
an
all
white
jury
in
jefferson
county,
arkansas.
the
population
of
jefferson
county
according
to
the
1950
census
is
76,075
of
which
37,835
or
approximately
50%
of
the
total
population
is
composed
of
colored
people.
the
jury
panel
is
selected
from
qualified
electors
within
the
county
pursuant
to
arkansas
law.
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial
on
the
lower
court
there
were
19,452
qualified
voters
in
jefferson
county,
of
which
5774
or
30%
were
negroes.
the
petitioner
in
proper
time
prior
to
the
hearing
of
the
case
on
the
merits
filed
a
motion
seeking
to
quash
the
jury
panel
on
the
grounds,
one,
that
for
more
than
50
years
in
jefferson
county,
arkansas
no
negro
had
ever
been
appointed
to
the
three-man
jury
commission
which
is
charged
with
responsibility
of
selecting
persons
to
serve
on
the
jury
panel
in
jefferson
county.
and
two,
that
of
the
persons
selected
for
jury
service,
that
the
jury
commission
was
acting
in
a
manner
so
as
to
have
and
inapportioned
limiting
of
the
number
of
negroes
called
for
jury
service
in
jefferson
county.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
term
of
office
of
the
jury
commission
amounts
to
approximately
six
months.
there
are
two
terms
of
court
each
year
and
the
court
appoints
a
three-man
jury
commission
a
few
days
prior
to
the
beginning
of
each
term
of
court.
the
term
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
it
is
the
practice
to
change
them
and
i'm
rather
definite
that
it
is
required
by
law
that
they
be
changed.
i
think
there
is
a
two
year
span
between
the
time
that
they
can
serve.
so
that
you
do
get
a
different,
an
entirely
different
jury
commission
at
each
term
of
court.
the
terms
of
court
in
jefferson
county
begin
in
march
and
in
october,
of
course
each
commission
serves
until
the
next
term
the
court
begins.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
not
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
only
prerequisite
for
voting
in
the
state
of
arkansas
is
a
payment
of
a
$1
poll
tax
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
--
and
then
you
are
a
qualified
to
elector
for
all
purposes
under
the
arkansas
law.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir.
you
can
skip
as
many
years
as
you
want,
the
only
requirement
being
that
if
you
pay
on
or
before
october
the
1st
of
the
year
preceding
the
year
in
which
the
elections
take
place.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
i
do
not
believe
that
they
are,
your
honor,
i
could
not
answer
that
question.
i
know
that
there
are
some
exclusions
by
law.
but
as
to
what
public
officials
they
include,
i
couldn't
answer
that.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir,
none
of
the
jury
commissioners
were
public
officials,
no.
they
were
proper
persons
to
serve
on
the
jury
commission.
we
only
charge
the
racial
discrimination
of
the
selection.
this
three-man
jury
commission
was
appointed
by
the
court
a
few
days
prior
to
each
term
of
court,
and
there
has
never
been
a
negro
serving
as
a
jury
commissioner
in
the
history
of
anybody
who
we
were
able
to
get
to
testify
who
had
any
knowledge
on
it
at
all.
there
has
been
a
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court
and
from
other
courts
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
race
in
the
selection
of
petit
juries
which
try
the
cases,
nor
of
grand
juries
which
return
the
indictment.
and
as
early
as
strauder
versus
west
virginia
this
court
said
that
the
constitution
of
juries
is
a
very
essential
part
of
the
protection
such
of
mode
of
trial
is
intended
to
secure.
we
have
no
case
law
at
all
to
support
our
argument,
other
than
to
say
a
fortiori
that
we
contend
that
such
reasoning
should
also
apply
to
the
three-man
jury
commission
which
selects
the
people
to
serve
on
the
jury
panel
in
the
first
place,
and
that
the
appointment
of
this
three-man
jury
commission
at
each
term
of
court
is
such
an
integral
part
of
the
selection
of
jurors,
that
if
there
has
been
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
persons
to
serve
on
this
commission
in
the
first
place
that
that
is
just
as
unconstitutional
as
discrimination
by
race
for
serving
on
either
a
petit
or
grand
jury.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
only
for
that
one
term
of
court.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
they
are
given
the
poll
tax
record
from
the
county
and
purportedly
they
go
through
this
entire
record
of
persons,
of
qualified
electors
and
select
at
random
or
in
any
manner
that
they
so
desire
a
sufficient
number
of
persons
to
serve
on
the
jury
panel.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
panels
normally
in
that
particular
county
consist
of
about
36
persons
for
the
regular
panel,
then
there
is
a
25-man
special
list
which
normally
is
not
opened
unless
the
36-man
panel
has
been
exhausted.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no.
they
select
really
three
panels.
the
jury
commission
selects
a
grand
jury
panel,
they
select
a
civil
petit
jury
and
then
they
select
a
criminal
petit
jury.
and
all
of
the
facts
now
which
i
talk
about
with
reference
to
the
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
panel,
i
have
specific
reference
to
the
criminal
jury
only
and
i
do
not
have
with
me
nor
do
i
raise
in
this
argument
discrimination
as
to
the
grand
jury
or
as
to
the
civil
jury.
now,
insofar
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned,
in
arkansas
it's
something
that
is
just
more
or
less
a
tradition,
because
to
my
own
personal
knowledge,
as
long
as
i
have
been
practicing
i
do
not
recall
a
single
instance
that
a
grand
jury
has
returned
an
indictment
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
it
is
normally
done
by
the
filing
of
an
information
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
we
raised
that
as
a
question
on
certiorari
but
we
were
not
granted
the
right
to
review
on
that
question.
as
a
matter
of
practice
it
is
done
by
the
filing
of
the
information
of
the
--
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
--
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
in
--
in
a
capital
case
the
state
has
10
peremptory
challenges
and
the
defendant
has
12
peremptory
challenges.
now,
the
second
reason
for
the
filing
of
our
motion
to
quash
the
panel,
aside
from
the
fact
that
no
negroes
have
ever
been
appointed
to
the
jury
commission,
the
fact
that
we
contend
that
there
has
been
an
arbitrary
and
an
inapportioned
limiting
of
the
number
of
negroes
serving
on
the
petit
jury.
now,
prior
to
1947
no
negro
had
ever
served
on
a
jury
in
jefferson
county
for
more
than
50
years.
and
in
the
march
1947
term
of
jefferson
circuit
court,
in
a
case
then
pending,
the
defense
attorney
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
then
panel
on
the
grounds
that
there
had
been
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
jury
service
in
that
county.
that
motion
was
granted
and
the
jury
commission
was
directed
to
select
a
new
panel
and
on
that
panel
there
were
some
13
or
more
negroes
appointed
on
the
panel.
but
beginning
with
the
next
term
of
court
which
was
the
october
term
of
1947,
down
to
and
including
the
october
term
of
1955,
on
page
25
of
the
petitioner's
brief
we
set
forth
there
the
total
number
of
persons
selected
on
the
panel
and
off
to
the
right
we
have
the
total
number
of
negroes
who
have
been
placed
on
that
panel.
if
you
will
note
there,
the
number
of
negroes
who
have
been
called
for
jury
service
not
for
one
term
of
court,
but
for
17
consecutive
terms
of
court
from
october
of
1947
down
to
october
of
1955,
you
have
only
had
a
total
of
29
negroes
called
for
jury
service
out
a
total
of
669
jurors
which
constitutes
only
four
and
three-tenths
percent
of
the
number
of
persons
called
for
jury
service.
if
you
will
note
there
it
seems
to
follow
a
rather
definite
pattern
of
limiting
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
panel
to
just
to
two
or
three
negroes
per
panel.
and
of
course
that
means
that
in,
not
only
in
a
capital
case
but
even
in
a
misdemeanor,
unless
there
happens
to
be
a
negro
on
that
panel
who
satisfies
the
prosecuting
attorneys,
then
it
means
that
the
state
has
more
peremptory
challenges
authorized
by
law,
so
that
they
can
exclude
all
of
the
negroes
on
the
panel
so
that
in
practical
effect
no
negro
can
actually
serve
on
a
jury
unless
it
meets
with
the
approval
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
that
case.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
they
must
be
persons
of
good
moral
character,
is
about
the
only
requirement
for
serving
on
the
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
that's
a
statutory
requirement.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
there
is
--
there's
no
educational
requirement,
there's
nothing
else,
that's
--
it
--
they
are
taken
purely
from
the
electors.
i'm
tying
to
see
if
i
cite
in
my
brief
the
exact
requirement.
on
the
top
of
page
three.
they
shall
select
from
the
electors
of
the
county
16
persons
of
good
character,
of
approved
integrity,
sound
judgment
and
reasonable
information
to
serve
the
next
time
that
the
court
has
grand
jurors.
and
i
do
know
that
that
is
the
same
requirement
for
persons
serving
as
petit
jurors.
those
are
the
only
requirements
under
the
arkansas
law.
that
is
cited
under
arkansas
--
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
arkansas
statute
section
39-206.
those
are
the
only
requirements
for
serving
on
the
jury
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
only
by
saying
that
because
of
this
inapportioned
limiting
and
having
such
few
negroes
on
the
panel,
we
see
here
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
total
number
of
negroes
ever
appearing
on
the
panel
is
less
than
the
peremptory
challenges
allowed
to
the
state
even
in
a
misdemeanor
case,
to
say
nothing
of
a
capital
case.
and
that
therefore,
the
state
could
if
it
wanted
to,
use
their
peremptory
challenges
to
exclude
the
few
negroes
who
were
actually
on
the
panel.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
contend
that
there
should
be
any
certain
number
of
negroes
on
the
panel.
in
fact,
we
don't
insist
there
should
be
a
single
negro
on
the
panel.
we
don't
ask
for
any
systematic
inclusion
and
certainly
i
think
we
all
agree
that
systematic
exclusion
is
wrong.
well,
we
say
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
jury
from
which
there
has
been
no
racial
consideration
or
discrimination
shown,
it
might
be
an
all
negro
panel,
it
might
be
all
white
panel,
but
we
say
that
the
pattern
that
has
been
followed
is
one
to
inapportionately
limit
the
number
of
negroes
who
are
placed
on
that
panel
and
that
it
is
therefore
discriminatory.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
that
is
what
we
allege,
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
that
is
the
position
that
we
take
in
our
brief
and
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
we
say
that
there
is
no
reason
to
say
that
there
are
not
a
sufficient
number
of
negroes
who
possess
all
of
those
qualifications.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
that
is
correct.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir.
i
think
they
are
separate
things.
we
don't
--
we
don't
raise
that
in
our
argument.
it's
--
it's
our
contention
that
there
is
sufficient
number
of
people
from
both
races
who
possess
the
necessary
qualifications,
and
that
the
qualifications
of
the
individual
juror
does
not
enter
into
this
other
than
the
fact
that
we
allege
that
there
is
a
racial
discrimination.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
this
includes
all
of
the
people
who
were
on
the
payroll
record
and
in
trying
to
show
the
number
of
persons
called,
at
that
time
the
only
information
which
we
could
find
was
that
if
they
were
--
if
their
names
never
appeared
on
the
payroll
record
at
sometime
or
another,
that
there
would
be
no
record
of
the
number
--
of
the
persons
who
were
actually
called
for
jury
service.
now
in
our
brief
we
cite
the
law
which
requires
that
these
persons
must
come
into
court,
in
answer
to
the
service
of
the
summons
by
the
sheriff
after
having
been
selected
by
the
jury
commissions.
and
that
if
they
are
then
excused
from
jury
service,
they
are
still
entitled
to
$5
per
day,
even
though
they
maybe
excused
when
they
come
there
and
show
some
good
cause
why
they
should
not
serve
on
their
--
on
that
panel.
and
that
therefore
the
payroll
record
is
probably
an
accurate
record
of
the
number
of
persons
called
for
jury
service,
both
white
and
colored.
now,
there
was
some
discussion
with
the
trial
court
when
that
was
offered
in
which
the
court
made
some
statement
that
persons
had
been
excused
by
the
court
without
ever
coming
to
the
court
that
therefore
their
names
would
not
appear.
there
was
no
proof
offered
on
it,
and
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
negroes
were
excused
in
any
greater
percentage
or
proportion
than
white
persons
were
excused.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
if
--
this
is
the
record
of
the
names
of
the
persons
who
appeared.
now
the
law
says
that
if
they
appear,
they
are
suppose
to
draw
the
pay.
so
we
insist
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
they
might
--
of
course
that's
not
in
the
record,
but
in
talking
with
the
clerk,
sometimes
they
go
maybe
several
months
before
they
come
by
and
claim
it,
if
they
don't
come
by,
you
mail
some
check
or
something.
the
general
rule,
they
claim
it.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
the
law
requires
that
they
be
paid.
i
think
there
are
some
people
who
have
never
actually
picked
up
the
check,
never
drawn
the
pay,
but
their
name
is
on
the
payroll
record
there
and
they
authorized
--
i
mean,
they
have
the
right
to
pick
it
up
if
they
ever
come
and
call
for
it.
i
don't
know
when
the
list
expires,
but
the
information
that
we
cite
here
was
obtained
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
the
record,
the
payroll
record
went
back
to
october
of
1947.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir.
if
they
are
summoned
and
appear
their
name
automatically
goes
on
that
payroll
record.
now
the
--
the
apparent
allegation
by
the
state
is
that
there
are
persons
who
are
summoned
and
who
get
excused
without
ever
even
coming
to
court,
and
that
their
names
do
not
appear
on
the
record.
now,
if
there
is
such
information,
we
don't
have
it,
and
we
feel
that
that
burden
was
on
the
state
to
show
it,
but
we
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
we
--
we
do
not
deny
it
that
it
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
--
that
at
sometime
it
probably
occurred,
but
we
--
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
--
we
certainly
do
not
concede
that
negroes
were
excused
in
any
greater
percentage
or
proportion
than
white
persons,
if
they
sought
excuses
prior
to
the
time
of
coming
to
court.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
pine
bluff.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
actually
your
honor
they
do
have.
i'd
have
to
go
out
of
the
record
to
discuss
that
because
at
that
time
that
was
all
of
the
information
that
we
could
get.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
it
would.
there
again,
that
is
not
in
the
record,
and
at
the
time
that
we
tried
this
case,
we
were
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
record.
in
fact,
the
record
we
have
is
the
only
record
that
was
available
to
us
at
that
time,
the
only
one
that
we
could
find
or
determine
was
actually
in
existence.
since
that
time
we've
found
that
there
is
another
record
but
it
is
not
in
this
record
and
i
certainly
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
comment
on
what
that
record
contains.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
sir?
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
record
in
the
circuit
clerk's
office
which
contains
the
actual
names
of
persons
selected
by
the
jury
commission
which
differs
somewhat
from
the
names
on
page
25
of
our
brief
in
that
it
includes
all
of
the
persons
put
on
the
panel
whether
they
served
or
not,
and
it
is
of
course
the
true
and
accurate
record.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
we
did
not
use
it
because
we
did
not
know
that
it
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
and
we
only
found
out
about
that
record
subsequent
to
the
trial.
in
fact
the
clerk
told
us
that
the
payroll
record
was
the
only
record
that
he
kept.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
he
said
that
that
was
the
only
record
that
he
kept
and
that
unless
they
had
actually
served
and
got
on
the
payroll
record
that
he
would
have
no
record.
but
now
that
of
course
is
--
is
not
in
the
record
of
this
case.
since
that
time
we
have
learned
that
there
was
a
true
record
and
i
have
had
the
opportunity
of
examining
that
record.
but
that
was
subsequent
to
the
trial
of
this
case
and
therefore
is
not
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
first
why
in
order
to
explain
why
i
happened
to
testify
because
it's
a
little
bit
unusual
for
a
defense
lawyer
to
testify.
i
had
intended
to
prove
this
information
by
the
testimony
of
a
deputy
sheriff
who
has
been
in
the
sheriff's
office
for
a
good
many
years
and
who
is
the
person
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
serving
these
summons.
the
trial
court
felt
that
it
would
delay
the
trial,
to
put
him
on
and
to
have
him
go
down
this
long
list
and
suggested
and
in
fact
invited
me
to
take
the
stand
and
to
testify
since
i
claimed
to
have
already
made
the
search.
it
is
nothing
unusual
in
a
rural
community
like
pine
bluff
or
jefferson
county.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
pine
bluff
is
a
pretty
good
sized
town
your
honor,
it's
about
40,000
persons.
but
generally
the
jury
commission
uses
the
same
people
over
and
over
for
jury
service
at
each
term
of
court,
allowing
only
an
elapse
of
the
time
requirement,
that
is
required
by
statute
in
which
they
cannot
serve.
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
you
would
not
find
--
i
mean,
of
the
669
people,
for
example
listed
on
page
25,
while
i
do
not
have
the
actual
record
on
it,
i
would
say
that
there
are
not
more
than
150
different
people,
they
have
used
the
same
people
over
and
over.
and
for
most
of
this
time,
the
jury
commission
would
insert
a
c
behind
the
name
of
every
colored
person
placed
on
the
panel.
now,
they
just
stopped
that
practice
just
a
few
years
ago,
and
if
you
go
back
from
1947
down
for
about
1952,
wherever
there
is
a
negro
on
the
panel
there
will
be
a
small
c
in
parenthesis
at
the
end
of
the
name
and
so
they
make
the
designation
by
race.
but
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
sir?
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
it
ended
somewhere
about
1952.
i
couldn't
be
exact
about
the
years,
but
i
know
that
the
first
few
years,
beginning
in
1947
the
jury
commission
in
filling
out
the
summons
list
would
insert
a
small
c
in
parenthesis
behind
the
name
of
each
negro,
and
it
is
nothing
unusual
in
a
situation
like
that
where
you
have
only
had
approximately
150
different
people
and
they
use
them
over
and
over
to
not
know
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
it
was
not
stopped
because
of
any
specific
decision,
i
rather
think
that
it
was
stopped
voluntarily
or
they
may
have
been
looking
at
decisions
from
other
courts,
they
then
stopped
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
there
was
no
--
no
case
pending
in
arkansas
which
called
at
least.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
they
were
also
repeated.
in
fact
on
page
26
of
our
brief
we
say
that
only
23
different
negroes
have
ever
been
called
for
jury
service.
and
of
course,
you've
only
had
29
calls
so
there
were
some
repeats
there.
and
most
of
these
negroes
who
have
been
called
for
jury
service
are
placed
on
the
panel,
are
persons
above
the
age
of
65
and
while
persons
65
years
old
and
older
may
serve
on
the
jury
panel,
they
can
claim
an
exemption
and
are
not
required
to
serve
if
they
so
elect.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
i
could
not
agree.
i
rather
--
i
am
rather
of
the
opinion
and
it
has
been
my
experience
that
the
few
negroes
who
have
been
called
for
jury
service
are
so
proud
of
the
fact
of
having
been
called,
that
the
percentage
of
persons
asking
to
be
excused
is
less
than
that
of
white
persons.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
selection
of
this
jury
panel,
the
jury
commission
is
given
the
poll
tax
list
and
they
select
their
names
entirely
from
the
poll
tax
list.
and
under
arkansas
law
it
is
required
that
the
race
of
the
taxpayer
be
shown
on
that
list
so
that
therefore
the
very
two
which
is
being
used
by
the
jury
commission
has
a
racial
designation
and
they
therefore
know
in
advance
whether
or
not
they
are
in
fact
selecting
a
white
person
or
a
colored
person.
the
three
jury
commissioners
testified
and
the
sum
total
of
their
testimony
we
think
brings
this
case
squarely
in
line
with
cassell
versus
texas.
we
cite
--
repeat
some
of
that
testimony
on
page
28
of
our
brief.
for
example,
in
the
footnotes
there,
in
asking
mr.
truelock
one
of
the
commissioners
a
question,
he
said
i
felt
that
in
the
selection
of
a
jury
i
could
not
take
anybody
that
i
didn't
know,
he
might
be
a
better
qualified
man
that
i
would,
but
i
still
wouldn't
know
it.
i
was
limited
to
the
number
of
people
whom
i
was
trying
to
select.
and
in
answer
to
a
further
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
personally
familiar
with
very
many
negroes
in
the
county
who
might
be
qualified
as
jurors,
his
answer
was,
"i
don't
think
i
am
sir."
and
then
down
at
the
bottom,
mr.
william
stated
that
he
had
raise
in
mind
when
he
selected
the
one
or
two
negroes
whose
names
appeared
on
the
panel.
we
say
that
to
select
persons
from
a
poll
tax
list
that
has
a
racial
designation
is
pretty
much
the
same
situation
that
you
had
in
avery
versus
georgia
where
they
put
the
names
of
the
white
jurors
on
the
white
slips
and
the
names
of
the
negro
jurors
on
yellow
slips.
now
we
can't
see
where
that
situation
is
any
different
from
where
you
go
out
and
select
the
names
in
the
first
place
from
an
official
poll
tax
record
that
designates
the
taxpayer
by
race.
and
we
say
that
the
whole
of
the
petitioner's
evidence
in
this
case
was
uncontradicted
and
that
his
motion
to
quash
the
jury
panel
should
therefore
have
been
granted.
we'd
like
to
move
on
to
the
confession
which
we
contend
was
unlawfully
obtained
from
the
defendant.
there
is
some
testimony
which
is
in
conflict
as
there
always
is
in
these
cases,
and
therefore
we
do
not
intend
to
even
mention
the
testimony
which
is
in
conflict.
the
court
under
the
usual
procedure
which
we
follow
in
arkansas
first
heard
the
testimony
relating
to
the
confession
in
chambers.
and
then
overruled
our
motion
to
quash
the
confession
on
the
grounds
that
it
has
been
unlawfully
obtained
and
we
went
then
into
the
jury
room
and
went
over
pretty
much
the
same
testimony
before
the
jury.
the
defendant,
petitioner
in
this
case
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
absolutely
total
exclusion.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
there
were
one
or
two
cases,
the
first
case
that
it
was
raised
in
was
in
washington
versus
state
of
arkansas
which
was
immediately
following
the
wilkerson
case
where
the
petition
was
granted.
and
the
court
said
in
that
particular
case,
that
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
proceeding
term
of
court,
the
motion
was
granted
and
negroes
were
put
on
the
jury
for
the
first
time,
that
the
petitioners
could
not
come
in
and
say
that
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
you
only
have
so
many
in
the
next
term
of
court
that
that
showed
a
systematic
inclusion
or
an
arbitrary
limiting
of
the
numbers
of
negro.
in
other
words,
there
had
not
been
a
sufficient
pattern
established.
and
this
is
the
only
case
to
my
knowledge
to
reach
the
state
of
arkansas
on
this
systematic
inclusion
where
you've
had
a
pattern
over
the
years,
of
course
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
affirmed
the
lower
court.
as
to
the
confession
the
defendant
took
the
stand
on
his
own
behalf
and
testified
that
he
was
19
years
old,
that
he
was
arrested
while
was
at
work
about
10
or
11
o'clock
on
a
wednesday
morning.
that
he
missed
his
regular
noon
meal
because
he
has
been
arrested.
and
that
he
was
in
the
chief
of
police's
office
that
afternoon
when
supper
was
being
served
and
consequently
other
than
getting
his
breakfast
on
wednesday
morning,
he
received
no
food
on
wednesday.
that
on
thursday
morning
he
was
awakened
around
6
o'clock
in
the
city
jail
in
pine
bluff,
required
to
remove
his
clothing
and
his
shoes
and
socks,
that
he
was
then
taken
to
little
rock
without
any
breakfast,
and
that
he
was
taken
to
state
police
headquarters
in
little
rock
where
he
was
given
a
lie
detector
test,
and
that
he
was
given
a
sandwich
around
1
p.m.
on
thursday,
and
that
that
was
the
first
food
in
the
more
than
26
hours
that
he
--
since
he
had
been
arrested.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
he
--
the
record
shows
that
he
was
required
to
take
off
his
clothing,
take
off
his
shoes
and
socks
and
in
researching
the
record,
i
see
where
he
got
some
shoes
back
when
he
got
to
little
rock,
the
record
is
silent
on
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
according
to
the
record
he
was
taken
naked,
now
nobody
asked
that
question
and
frankly
that's
a
question
that
has
intrigued
me
upon
rereading
the
record.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
they
were
taken
off
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
oh,
no,
no.
they
say
that
they
took
them
off
to
examine
for
blood
stains,
but
they
also
say
in
answer
to
some
questions
that
they
gave
him
some
shoes
back,
when
they
got
him
up
to
little
rock.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir,
because
the
question
was
not
raised
as
to
--
by
either
side
as
to
whether
or
not
they
ever
gave
him
any
clothes
back.the
only
question
which
is
in
the
record
is
to
whether
or
not
they
ever
gave
him
any
shoes,
and
in
answer
to
that
they
said,
yes,
they
gave
him
some
when
they
got
to
little
rock.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
police
officer
who
testified
said
they
gave
him
some
--
maybe
an
hour
or
so
after
he
got
to
little
rock
which
was
about
three
hours
after
they
took
them
off.
well,
i
think
they
took
the
shoes
off
the
night
before
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
sir?
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
on
page
56
of
the
record,
up
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
question
was
on
the
morning
you
got
him
up
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
this
was
in
--
this
was
in
the
middle
of
october.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
i
rather
think
it
was
more
or
less
normal
climate.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
a
little
--
a
little
bit
on
the
cool
side
but
people
to
put
shoes
back
on
by
that
time
in
arkansas.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
how
is
that,
sir?
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
most
of
them
don't
--
most
of
us
don't
go
barefooted
as
late
as
october,
your
honor.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
your
honor
it
would
vary
depending
of
course
upon
the
time
of
day
and
i
just
couldn't
answer
that
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
i
just
couldn't
answer
that
question.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
arkansas
is
just
below
missouri.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir.
pine
bluff
is
in
south
eastern
arkansas.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir.
it
is
--
it
is
only
a
100
miles
from
greenville,
mississippi.
but
it's
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
i
think
your
honor
can
conclude
that
i
probably
would
have
asked
the
question
if
i
had
thought
that
he
had
been
taken
naked.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
defendant
also
alleges
that
on
thursday
upon
his
return
to
pine
bluff,
after
this
lie
detector
examination
and
questioning
in
little
rock,
that
he
was
taken
to
dumas,
arkansas
and
locked
up
in
jail
down
there.
that
he
was
kept
awake
all
night
by
a
jailer
who
threatened
him
with
the
same
type
of
treatment
which
was
accorded
to
a
negro
boy
over
in
mississippi.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
this
was
thursday
night.
now,
your
honor
that
point
is
in
dispute,
the
defendant
claims
that
he
was
taken
down
to
the
city
jail
in
dumas
on
thursday
night
before
his
confession
on
friday.
the
state
contends
that
he
was
not
taken
to
dumas
until
friday
night
after
the
confession.
now,
they
don't
deny
that
those
things
didn't
happen
to
him
down
there,
but
they
just
say
that
it
happened
after
the
confession
and
not
before
the
confession.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
taken
to
dumas,
arkansas
which
is
some
50
miles
south
of
pine
bluff
where
he
was
locked
up
in
jail
for
safekeeping
because
the
chief
of
police
thought
that
there
might
be
some
mob
action
in
pine
bluff
and
he
was
kept
awake
all
night
long
by
the
jailer
who
threatened
him
with
physical
abuse
and
told
him
that
the
same
thing
would
happened
to
him
that
had
happened
to
a
negro
boy
over
in
mississippi.
and
why,
we
don't
know
what
he
had
in
mind.
this
was
at
or
about
the
same
time
that
the
(inaudible)
case
was
in
the
news
everyday.
the
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
that
he
was
taken
down
there?
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir,
i
do
not,
other
than
the
fact
i
know
that
it
was
in
the
news
at
that
time.
i
do
not
know
the
exact
date.
i
do
recall
that
the
incident
happened
in
august
of
1955.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
well,
they
--
they
point
out
the
fact
that
the
state
says
that
that
was
after
the
confession.
i
think
they
agree
with
the
statement,
it
was
after
the
confession.
that
is
the
only
point
in
the
confession
that
we
say
that
there
is
any
conflict
of
testimony
on
it
all.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
jailer
--
the
jailer
at
dumas,
arkansas
kept
the
petitioner
awake
all
night
in
the
jail
questioning
him,
threatening
him,
tell
him
that
--
and
according
to
the
defendant,
made
remarks
that
he
was
going
to
be
hang,
and
that
he,
the
jailer,
would
be
there
when
they
hang
him
and
that
they
would
do
the
same
thing
to
him
that
they
did
to
the
colored
boy
over
in
mississippi.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
it
is
not
questioned
that
that
took
place.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
only
thing
that
is
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
that
--
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
that
is
questioned.
the
petitioner
said
that
it
happened
on
thursday
night
before
the
confession
on
friday.
the
state
says
that
it
happened
on
friday
night
after
the
confession
on
friday
afternoon.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
that's
the
point
that's
in
conflict.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
jailer
did
not
testify.
they
offered
no
evidence
to
contradict
that
this
situation
happened,
they
only
say
that
it
happened
on
the
night
before
the
confession,
i
mean,
on
the
night
after
the
confession.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
state.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
or
the
state
patrolman
who
took,
sergeant
halsell,
who
took
the
defendant
down
to
dumas,
stated
that
he
took
the
defendant
to
dumas
on
friday
night
after
the
confession.
the
defendant
said
that
he
was
taken
to
dumas
on
thursday
night
before
the
confession.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir,
insofar
as
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
defendant
also
testified
that
he
knew
of
his
own
knowledge
that
two
of
his
brothers
were
arrested
prior
to
his
confession.
he
also
states
that
he
knows
that
three
of
his
nephews
were
arrested,
and
he
claims
that
the
chief
of
police
told
him
that
before
it
was
over
with,
if
he
didn't
confess
that
they
were
going
to
go
out
and
get
his
whole
family
including
his
mother.
the
chief
of
police
of
course
denies
making
that
statement.
the
chief
does
admit
however
and
substantiates
a
statement
made
by
the
defendant
that
immediately
prior
to
his
confession
at
or
about
1
o'clock
on
friday
afternoon
that
the
chief
of
police
came
up
to
his
cell
in
the
jail
and
told
him
that
there
were
30
or
40
people
outside
who
wanted
to
get
in
to
him
and
that
if
he
would
tell
the
truth
about
it
that
he
could
probably
keep
these
people
from
getting
to
him.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir
and
we
--
we
raise
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
and
--
and
as
to
that
issue
which
is
in
conflict,
we
merely
state
that
part
for
the
record
because
we
take
the
position
that
the
trial
court
and
the
jury
had
the
right
to
pass
on
that
as
a
factual
matter
and
we
don't
raise
that
as
a
part
of
it
at
all.
but
we
merely
mentioned
it
in
relating
the
testimony
that
we
do
have
here,
because
so
many
of
the
other
things
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
--
are
not
conflicted.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
defendant
was
arrested
on
a
thursday
morning
without
a
warrant.
he
was
held
in
jail
all
day
on
thursday
through
the
noon
hour
without
any
food.
he
was
not
given
any
supper
on
thursday
night
or
rather
on
wednesday
night
the
day
of
his
arrest.
he
was
awakened
at
6
o'clock
on
a
thursday
morning
and
taken
at
least
barefooted
and
with
no
socks
to
little
rock
without
breakfast.
he
was
given
a
lie
detector
test
up
in
little
rock
and
questioned
all
day
in
little
rock.
he
was
never
arraigned,
not
even
up
until
the
day
of
his
trial,
the
first
time
that
any
--
any
question
came
up
about
arraignment
was
on
the
day
of
the
trial.
of
course,
at
the
day
of
the
trial
there
was
no
point
in
worrying
about
arraignment
at
that
time.
arkansas
law
requires
first
of
all
that
a
person
not
be
arrested
without
a
warrant,
unless
there
is
probably
reason
for
believing
that
the
person
being
arrested
has
committed
a
felony.
well
even
if
they
had
probable
reason
for
thinking
that
he
had
committed
a
felony,
the
law
still
requires
that
the
person
so
arrested
be
taken
forthwith
before
the
nearest
magistrate
and
properly
informed
of
the
charges
placed
against
him
and
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel.
this
defendant
was
never
arraigned
and
that
is
uncontradicted
and
is
admitted
to
by
the
parties.
he
was
--
the
chief
of
police
went
up
to
his
cell
on
1
o'clock
on
friday,
the
day
of
the
confession
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
he
did
not
have
breakfast
before
going
to
little
rock.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
he
was
arrested
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
all
right.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
well,
from
the
time
of
his
arrest
at
10
o'clock
on
a
wednesday
morning,
until
the
time
of
his
confession
at
1
o'clock
on
friday,
he
had
a
sandwich
at
about
1
o'clock
on
thursday
and
he
had
breakfast
on
friday
morning.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
immediately
prior
to
his
confession
and
following
all
of
the
other
events
which
we
have
alleged,
it
is
uncontradicted
that
the
chief
of
police
went
to
his
cell
on
the
jail
and
told
the
defendant
that
there
were
30
or
40
people
outside
who
wanted
to
get
into
him
and
that
if
he
would
tell
the
truth
and
confess
that
he
could
probably
keep
them
from
getting
him.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
the
chief
of
police
testified
and
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
such
an
event
occurred.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
five
minutes,
the
man
confessed
and
went
downstairs
and
made
the
confession
orally
to
the
chief
and
then
went
out
and
got
a
stenographer
and
wrote
it
out.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
may
it
please
the
court.
i
noticed
that
there
has
been
considerable
questioning
back
and
forth
as
to
what
the
chief
of
police
meant
about
whether
or
not
there
were
30
or
40
people
downstairs
just
prior
to
the
confession.
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
bottom
of
page
113
on
cross-examination
of
the
chief
of
police
by
myself,
i
specifically
asked
him
this
question,
“state
whether
or
not
anything
was
said
to
the
defendant
to
the
effect
that
there
would
be
30
or
40
people
there
in
a
few
minutes
that
wanted
to
get
him?
his
answer
was,
“i
told
him
that
would
be
possible,
that
would
be
that
many.
it
was
possible
there
could
be
that
many.”
i
think
that
clears
up
what
the
chief
of
police
meant
because
certainly
the
question
was,
“did
you
tell
him
that
there'd
be
that
many
people
there
to
get
him.”
now
the
state
contends
what
he
meant
was,
there'd
be
30
or
40
people
there
to
witness
the
confession.
and
certainly
to
use
the
language
to
get
him,
it
can't
mean
but
one
thing
namely
just
what
it
implied
that
there
would
be
possible
mob
violence.
the
defendant
specifically
repudiates
his
confession
on
page
94.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
transcript
of
record
printed
here
as
to
the
defense
on
the
merits
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
only
part
of
the
record
here
is
that
part
designated
by
the
petitioner.
naturally,
the
petitioner
was
only
going
to
designate
that
part
that
this
court
would
consider
on
certiorari,
we
didn't
feel
that
we
should
make
our
state's
case,
they
failed
to
cross
designate,
it's
not
here.
the
defendant
took
the
witness
stand
on
his
own
behalf
admitted
to
the
slaying,
but
states
that
he
was
working
there,
that
he
and
his
employer
got
into
a
very
heated
argument
that
the
employer
slapped
him
and
that
he
reached
down,
passed
an
iron
bar,
and
that
he
jumped
over
this
counter,
that
they
fought
over,
he
got
it
away
from
him
and
beat
him
with
an
iron
bar
and
when
he
realized
what
he
had
done
that
his
first
thought
was
to
get
away
and
the
man
was
there
checking
up
and
he
took
some
money.
now
it
should
be
remembered
that
this
defendant
was
not
charged
with
a
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
while
in
the
perpetration
of
a
felony,
because
the
state
would
have
had
--
would
have
had
an
easier
case
in
the
arkansas
law,
no
premeditation
being
required.
now,
they're
trying
to
imply
here
that
he
was
charged
with
robbing
the
man.
but
he
wasn't
even
charged
with
that.
it's
true
that
he
had
400
some
odd
dollars
but
he
was
never
charged
with
a
slaying
while
the
perpetration
of
a
felony.
and
that
is
significant.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
no,
sir.
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
if
your
honor
please,
we
object
to
the
information
in
the
first
place
because
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
we
objected
--
mr.
wiley
a.
branton
we
objected
to
the
testimony
of
sergent
halsell
who
first
testified,
yes,
sir
we
did.
but
if
--
if
you
have
reference
to
the
objection
of
the
possible
commission
of
other
crimes
insofar
as
that
angle
is
concerned
we
did
not
raise
that
as
a
legal
question.
as
to
that
payroll
record,
the
payroll
record
is
--
the
payroll
record
accurately
reflects
the
actual
number
of
persons
who
served
on
the
jury
in
jefferson
county.
and
therefore
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
the
number
of
negroes
who
served
the
preceding
year,
one
commissioner
said
that
he
couldn't
use
all
of
those
who
had
been
used
a
year
before.
the
record
shows
that
only
two
or
perhaps
four
had
been
used
a
year
before.
anybody
who
had
been
excused
would
not
be
on
the
payroll
record
and
therefore
could
be
used
on
the
next
panel.
the
testimony
as
to
that
payroll
record
is
uncontradicted.
the
state
says
if
we
don't
know
how
to
add
and
that
the
total
number
there
is
640,
we
still
get
669.
we
attempted
to
put
the
sheriff
on
the
stand,
the
record,
the
permanent
record
is
kept
not
in
the
sheriff's
office,
but
in
the
office
of
the
circuit
clerk
the
same
person
who
said
he
had
no
such
record.
and
the
court
didn't
even
want
us
to
burden
the
trial
because
after
all
we
had
been
in
court
for
half
a
day
and
if
you
take
longer
than
two
days
in
arkansas
to
electrocute
a
negro,
why
then,
you
have
an
unusually
long
trial.
so
we
wound
up
in
two
days.
and
the
court
didn't
want
this
trial
delayed
and
suggested
that
i
get
on
the
stand
and
testify.
now
we
submit
that
after
having
been
invited
to
make
this
testimony
and
certainly
we
have
the
burden,
then
the
burden
of
rebutting
that
presumption
which
we
had
raised
was
on
the
state
and
they
offered
no
testimony
whatsoever
to
rebut
the
evidence
which
we
had
offered.
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
more
negroes
excused
from
jury
service
as
compared
with
white,
the
record
is
silent.
as
i
say,
we'd
have
go
outside
the
record
but
certainly
the
percentage
of
negroes
who
served
would
be
even
more
disparaging
if
we
used
the
accurate
record
rather
than
the
payroll
record.
and
even
if
that
was
not
true
there
is
nothing
here
that
the
state
says
that
people
get
excused
for
two
things,
having
made
this,
and
this,
that
and
the
other.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
can
take
any
judicial
knowledge
of
the
fact
or
be
presumptuous
enough
to
say
that
negroes
have
any
more
(inaudible)
than
white
people,
that
therefore
a
greater
percentage
of
negroes
would
asked
to
be
excused
than
would
white.
and
as
to
the
inference
that
might
be
raised
by
such
a
situation
as
you
have
in
jefferson
county
with
such
a
small
number
of
people,
being
--
negroes
being
called
for
jury
service
over
a
long
period
of
time.
this
court
said,
in
another
decision
coming
out
of
texas
that
it
should
tax
the
credulity
of
the
court,
to
say
that
mere
chance
resulted
in
such
few
negroes
being
called
for
jury
service
in
a
county,
where
you
have
such
a
high
percentage
of
negroes
making
up
the
population
and
a
high
percentage
of
qualified
voters.
another
question
was
directed
to
the
attorney
general
as
to
whether
or
not
in
jefferson
county
you
would
find
an
unusually
high
percentage
of
illiterate
colored
people
in
that
county.
now
i've
lived
in
that
county
all
in
my
life.
insofar
as
negroes
are
concerned,
jefferson
county
is
the
leading
cultural
and
educational
county
of
the
state
of
arkansas
for
negroes.
it
is
the
home
of
the
arkansas
state
college
for
negroes.
it
is
the
home
of
(inaudible)
institute
for
negroes.
for
many,
many
years
the
negro
high
school
has
been
accredited
by
the
north
central
association.
and
i
dare
say
that
percentage
wise
there
is
a
greater
percentage
of
literate
negroes
in
jefferson
county
than
any
other
county
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
that
the
literacy
qualifications
of
negroes
is
probably
equal
to
or
superior
percentage
wise
than
the
literacy
test
of
white
people
in
that
county
because
there
is
not
a
single
white
college
within
that
county.
and
certainly
anytime
that
you
have
a
county
where
you've
had
a
college
down
through
the
years,
there
generally
is
a
higher
literacy
portion
in
that
particular
county
than
you
have
in
a
county
where
you
do
not
have
a
college.
