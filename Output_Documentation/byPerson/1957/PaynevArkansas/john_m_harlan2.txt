(inaudible)
justice
john

could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
table
on
page
25,
is
that
the
total
number
of
negro
column
on
the
righthand
side,
does
that
show
all
the
people
who
were
called
or
merely
those
who
were
on
the
top?
i
mean,
in
other
words,
would
it
be
--
does
this
exclude
the
possibility
that
there
were
others
who
were
called
and
for
some
reason
or
other,
were
not
put
on
the
panel
because
they
asked
to
be
excused,
that
they
weren't
found
qualified
or
something?

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
--
justice

m.
harlan
that
doesn't
appear
in
this
record,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
typewritten
record
this
morning
and
i
looked
at
it
hastily,
am
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
he
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense
apart
from
the
confession,
he
admitted
that
he
killed
the
man
and
that
the
defense
was
that
he
had
done
it
in
self
defense,
is
that
correct?

m.
harlan
heat
of
passion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
he
never
repudiated
his
confession
on
the
witness
stand
which
he
did
--
where
he
testified
in
his
own
behalf,
did
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
in
the
typewritten
record
that
you
haven't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
haven't
printed
that
part
of
the
testimony
in
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
typewritten
record
to
get
the
whole
picture
of
what
this
fellow
testified
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you've
got
to
look
at
the
typewritten
record
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
this
typewritten
testimony,
this
typewritten
record,
he
admitted
that
he
took
the
money,
didn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
testified
affirmative
of
having
taken
the
money.
