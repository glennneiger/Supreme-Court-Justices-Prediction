mr.
thorp
thomas
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
regarding
the
systematic
exclusion
is
as
i
see
it,
did
the
petitioner
here
meet
the
burden
of
proof
imposed
on
him
by
the
rule
announced
in
patton
against
mississippi,
by
showing
a
conscious
and
a
purposeful
and
arbitrary
discrimination
of
race
in
the
selection
of
a
petit
jury.
since
they
were
members
of
the
negro
race
on
the
panel
at
which
this
petitioner
was
tried,
then
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
petitioner
to
prove
a
conscious
discrimination
by
the
limiting
of
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
panel.
now
this,
the
state
of
arkansas
contends
that
he
has
failed
to
do,
taking
the
record
and
staying
well
within
its
bounds,
on
record
11
and
12,
it's
pertinent
testimony
of
the
jury
commissioner
truelock,
said
the
question,
“do
you
know
very
many
negroes
who
would
be
qualified
for
jury
service?”
he
answers,
“i
think
so.”
question
“do
you
think
of
any
while
you
served
on
this
panel?”
answer
“well,
there
were
quite
a
few
that
i
certainly
would
have
selected,
but
they
had
already
served
the
past
year
or
had
some
other
reason
why
they
could
not.”
also
on
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
the
payroll
record
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
they
--
no,
your
honor
they
could
not
have
served
without
being
on
it.
the
last
record
was
in
1955
which
showed
a
total
number
of
two
negroes
on
the
panel.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
the
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
the
other
reasons
your
honor
i
can't
answer.
he
did
explain
later
in
his
testimony
that
he
felt
some
of
them
lived
too
far
away
from
pine
bluff,
that
it
would
impose
on
them
to
ask
them
to
come
in,
some
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
said
they,
and
later
on
in
his
testimony
he
does
explain
that.
but
one
of
the
reasons
he
said
that
he
did
not
select
more
negroes
on
the
panel
was
because
they
had
already
served
the
previous
year
and
under
the
arkansas
law
they
can
only
serve
once
every
two
years.
mr.
thorp
thomas
now
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
mr.
chief
justice
warren
it
reflects
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
this
--
this
record
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
that
you
are
reading
from
is
the
payroll
record
which
does
not
disclose
all
of
the
negroes
that
were
summoned
for
jury
service.
it
reflects
only
those
who
actually
served
on
the
jury.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
as
a
practical
matter
in
arkansas
and
the
way
it
works
is
if
you
have
a
toothache
or
something
you
can
get
on
the
phone
and
call
the
judge
and
tell
him,
"well,
i've
got
a
toothache.
i
got
to
go
to
a
dentist
or
i
am
sick
or
my
wife
is
going
to
have
a
baby,"
and
the
judge
is
simply
not
going
to
make
you
come
down.
therefore
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
the
--
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that.
but
i
will
--
there
is
some
testimony
here
between
mr.
branton
and
the
trial
judge
regarding
that
particular
point.
and
it
appears
at
25
and
26
of
the
record.
about
three-fourths
of
the
way
down
on
page
25.
the
court
made
this
statement.
“you
are
testifying
from
the
payroll
that
indicates
that
that
is
the
number
who
have
actually
served
on
the
jury.
do
you
know
that
the
jury
commission
has
selected
many
other
colored
people
who
at
their
request
the
court
has
excused
and
who
did
not
serve?”
mr.
branton
answers,
he
said,
“are
you
asking
me
that?”
the
court
said,
“i
am
asking
you
if
you
know
that.”
mr.
branton
says,
“all
i
know
is
that
from
time
to
time
negroes
have
been
excused
from
jury
service.”
and
then
the
court
says
if
their
names
don't
show
on
this
list
because
they
were
excused,
they
don't
draw
or
pay
and
mr.
branton
says
that
may
be
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
i
think
its
testimony
on
the
part
of
mr.
branton's.
mr.
thorp
thomas
it's
--
it's
certainly
a
fact
that
needed
clarifying.
now
to
give
you
an
example
of
what
i'm
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
there's
no
--
there's
no
proof
in
the
record
as
to
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
and
that's
your
honors,
precisely
the
point
i'm
making,
that
under
the
holding
in
the
patton
against
mississippi,
the
burden
since
there
were
negroes
on
this
particular
panel,
the
burden
was
not
on
the
state
to
show
how
many
negroes
it
served
or
had
not
served.
the
burden
was
on
the
petitioner
and
he
did
not
meet
that
burden
because
he
doesn't
show
how
many
were
actually
selected,
he
just
merely
shows
how
many
actually
served
and
was
paid.
now,
to
indicate
my
point
a
little
further,
you
will
notice
that
on
page
25
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
on
the
october
1947
term.
it
says
the
total
number
of
jurors
is
31
and
the
total
number
of
negroes
two.
well
in
this
washington
against
the
state
in
the
213,
arkansas
at
218,
it
involves
a
trial
during
this
particular
term,
this
october
of
1947
term.
and
here
is
what
the
arkansas
court
said
speaking
on
the
facts
that
the
proof
in
this
record
shows
that
the
three
negroes
who
were
a
member
of
the
regular
panel,
petit
jurors
called
in
this
case
and
then
they
list
them
(inaudible),
and
they
were
numbered
7,
10
and
12.
now
then,
if
mr.
branton's
payroll
record
is
correct,
then
he
is
minus
one
on
that
very
proof
alone.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
supreme
court
record
of
the
march
1947,
october
term
rather
of
1947
in
jefferson
county
that
shows
that
there
were
three
negroes.
mr.
branton's
record
here
merely
shows
two.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
wasn't
there
your
honor.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
the
prosecuting
attorney
did
not
contest
it.
mr.
thorp
thomas
no.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
the
delay
of
time,
i
don't
think
that
mr.
branton
would
deliberately
fabricate
his
testimony,
and
i
doubt
that
the
judge
did
there
either.
if
i
had
been
there
i
would
probably
agree
to
it,
although
what
i'm
saying
here
now,
the
burden
was
not
on
the
state
to
prove
how
many
were
summoned,
the
burden
was
on
the
petitioner
to
show
a
conscious
and
deliberate
discrimination
and
he
has
failed
to
do
it.
for
example,
and
i
think
to
show
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
it
probably
wouldn't
in
that
instance,
no.
mr.
thorp
thomas
there
are
some
breaking
points.
now,
i
noticed
in
the
cases
like
hill
against
texas,
in
patton
against
mississippi,
there
it
had
been
a
great
lapse
of
time
in
all
of
those
cases
where
there
had
been
no
negro
to
serve
on
the
juries,
now
here
in
this
case
on
the
payroll
evidence
alone
it
indicates
that
they
were
including
negroes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
correct.
mr.
thorp
thomas
now,
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
this
question
too
about
an
arkansas
statute
in
regard
to
how
the
jurors
are
paid,
and
that
is
that
arkansas
statutes
39,
301.1
and
it
reads
thusly,
“person
whose
names
appear
on
any
legal
and
authorized
grand
jury
or
petit
jury
list
of
the
respective
counties
of
arkansas,
shall
receive
in
addition
to
other
fees
allowed
down
blow
other
than
under
authority
of
another
act,
a,
when
such
person
or
a
person
failed
for
any
reason
to
attend
court,
none.
b,
when
such
persons
are
persons
attend
court
and
are
excused
by
the
court
for
any
reason
from
serving
as
a
juror
$5
and
then
when
they
actually
serve
its
$7.50.”
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
what
actually
occurs.
i
mean,
there's
--
if
--
of
course
there's
no
proof
in
this
record
that
that
happens.
mr.
thorp
thomas
as
meaning
everybody
who
actually
served.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
i
believe
you
can
go
that
far.
mr.
thorp
thomas
actually
appeared.
mr.
thorp
thomas
not
necessarily
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
--
i
think
the
--
how
easy
can
--
you
can
get
excused
from
serving
depends
in
large
part
on
how
pressing
the
need
is
for
a
juror's
particular
time.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
would
say
so,
yes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
as
the
other.
now
to
get
back
to
the
--
and
i
believe
there
was
one
other
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
in
arkansas,
around
the
1st
of
october,
it
is
generally
around
70
degrees.
mr.
thorp
thomas
which
might
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
count
in
part
for
that
we
in
arkansas
don't
wear
shoes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
sir?
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
it
is.
mr.
thorp
thomas
hardly
ever
gets
really
cold
until
sometime
in
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
january.
mr.
thorp
thomas
to
get
back
to
the
--
on
my
point
here,
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
this
conscious
limiting
of
the
juries
and
the
burden
was
on
him
to
show
it,
jury
commissioner
(inaudible),
when
he
was
asked
at
record
15,
when
you
selected
al
pinnington,
were
you
selecting
him
as
just
another
juror
or
were
you
selecting
him
with
a
special
and
point
in
mind
to
get
a
negro
on
the
panel.
and
the
commissioner
answered,
"well,
i
don't
know
that
we
made
anything
special
of
that.
we
felt
like
the
jury
we
were
selecting
was
responsible
citizens
of
the
county."
in
other
words
he
--
that's
no
proof
of
any
conscious
or
arbitrary
discrimination.
mr.
thorp
thomas
sir?
mr.
thorp
thomas
of
the
county.
mr.
thorp
thomas
now
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
there
is
--
it's
the
same
method,
it's
identical.
mr.
thorp
thomas
only
in
the
county
in
which
i
am
from.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
in
our
county
the
--
there
is
pretty
good
cross
section
on
our
juries,
both
civil
and
criminal.
mr.
thorp
thomas
it's
a
different
county.
it
is
an
adjoining
county,
i
believe.
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
now,
to
get
back
to
the
minds
of
these
jury
commissioners,
where
to
me
the
whole
answer
to
this
problem
lies
is
to
the
--
it
was
the
burden
on
the
petitioner
to
show
this
conscious
discrimination.
now,
here
is
what
one
of
the
commissioner,
this
was
truelock.
“so,
do
you
recall
whether
or
not
the
names
of
other
12?
do
you
recall
whether
or
not
the
names
of
any
other
negroes
were
mentioned
to
the
panel?”
answer
“any
others,
yes,
sir,
other
than
the
ones
that
were
selected,
the
answer
is
yes,
sir.”
question
“how
did
you
arrive
at
the
selection
of
those
that
were
selected?
did
you
decide
you
wanted
so
many
on
there?”
meaning
so
many
negroes
on
there,
presumably
to
--
as
the
way
the
question
was
loaded,
presumably
to
comply
with
the
law
or
just
barely
comply,
and
his
answer
was,
“no,
we
just
go
down
the
list
and
here
is
the
man.
we
discussed
to
him
what
he
would
do
or
would
not
do,
will
it
be
possible
to
serve
or
was
he
too
old.
what
was
his
work
and
just
those
things,
in
fact
it
is
a
very
difficult
operation
to
get
a
jury
and
we
were
coming
to
get
anybody
we
thought
could
serve.”
now
that
is
completely
barren
of
any
inference
that
they
wanted
to
get
anything
other
than
a
representative
jury.
and
his
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
don't
think
that
you
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
what
i
think
would
be
the
fair
inference.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
that
based,
and
i'd
have
to
draw
two
inferences
from
your
question,
one
that
the
number
of
negroes
as
you
said
ran
from
zero
to
six,
i'd
have
to
assume
that
that
list
included
all
those
who
had
been
selected
to
serve.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
one
or
two
it
might
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
double
it
or
less
than?
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
don't
think
there
is
any
inference
allowable
from
there.
mr.
thorp
thomas
now,
you
said
the
population
was
equally
divided,
that
is
true
but
when
it
comes
down
to
the
number
who
are
qualified
to
serve
as
juries
then
it
ceases
to
be
50-50.
then
it
comes
down
to
something
like
one-third
and
two-thirds.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
in
arkansas
was
having
a
poll
tax,
plus
the
other
four
things
that
are
set
out
by
the
statute.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
it's
--
it's
set
out
in
both
briefs
your
honor,
page
24
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
at
page
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
about
2
to
1.
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
page
15
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
have
no
--
i
have
no
idea.
judging
from
the
makeup
of
that
particular
county,
it
would
be
my
guess
that
there
is
a
great
amount
of
illiteracy,
because
it's
largely
an
agricultural
county.
it
is
changing
somewhat
now.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
think
that
they
have
to
show
that
--
that
the
jury
commissioner's
mind,
there
is
an
intent
to
discriminate
and
i
think
that
the
only
way
you
could
show
it
even
backing,
apparently
as
you
are
over
a
number
of
years,
that
you
could
not
take
the
jury
commissioner's
one
isolated
instance
where
the
--
and
bring
the
jury
commissioners
in
and
have
him
testified.
i
think
you
would
have
to
go
back
to
really
prove
it,
to
go
back
to
the
jury
commissioners
and
at
each
term
they
were
selected
and
examine
them.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
not
when
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
think
if
you
look
at
it
from
a
mathematical
viewpoint
which
i
know
sometimes
this
court
does,
from
the
number
of
white
people
selected
which
mr.
branton
i
believe
his
record
shows
669,
if
you
re-add
the
column
at
640,
the
number
of
white
persons
who
have
served
in
relation,
in
their
ratio
to
the
number
that
have
poll
taxes
and
we
presume
they
are
qualified
meet
the
other
four
requirements,
then
only
4.68%
of
the
qualified
white
persons
have
served
over
the
same
period
of
time.
so
i
don't
think
that
that's
any
criteria.
mr.
thorp
thomas
october
1955?
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
they've
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
now,
of
course
you
are
having
first
to
speculate
that
none
were
chosen,
because
this
is
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
as
i
understand
the
holding
in
patton
against
mississippi,
the
burden
was
not
on
the
state
to
prove
that.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
is
correct,
i
mean
i
don't
know.
i
can't
speculate
or
draw
an
inference
from
jury
commissioners
that
i
have
never
seen
and
don't
know.
i
don't
know
what
they
were
thinking.
mr.
thorp
thomas
they
--
to
--
i
grant
you
it
does
arouse
your
suspicious
--
suspicions
somewhat.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
probably
true.
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this
is
not
the
complete
picture.
and
it's
somewhat
the
same
situation
that
the
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
none.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
believe
in
the
pierre
case
there
was
a
showing
that
for
a
great
number
of
years
there
had
been
no
negroes
on
the
panel.
mr.
thorp
thomas
then
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
it
probably
wouldn't
if
it
were
consistently
come
up
with
one
on
it.
mr.
thorp
thomas
however
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
it's
possible
that
they
didn't
know.
mr.
thorp
thomas
it's
possible
that
they
knew
some
and
they
didn't
think
they
were
qualified.
there
is
many
probables
in
it.
mr.
thorp
thomas
in
the
cassell
case,
yes.
but
in
the
pierre
case,
and
in
the
patton
case,
where
for
a
great
number
of
years
it
is
--
it
has
shown
that
there
have
been
no
negroes
on
the
panel,
then
they
have
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
and
the
burden
of
proof
then
shifts
to
the
state
to
bring
on
some
evidence
to
prove
why
there
were
never
any
selected.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
here
--
in
here
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
because
here
there
--
we
know
some
have
served
in
practically
every
--
in
every
term
of
court.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true.
according
to
the
payroll
record.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true,
and
i
think
that
this
court
will
have
to
change
its
past
decisions.
mr.
thorp
thomas
let's
say
patton
against
mississippi,
or
even
--
let's
take
the
brown
against
allen.
there
the
jury
commissioners,
i
believe
they
were
selecting
a
grand
jury,
very
frankly
stated,
and
it's
in
the
record.
and
it's
in
--
it's
in
the
report
that
they
didn't
intend
to
select
but
one,
negro
for
the
grand
jury
and
after
they
got
him
on
there
they
were
through
with
the
negro
question.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
that's
true
but
i
mean
taking
this
record
from
what
was
happening
prior
to
the
wilkerson
case
in
--
in
this
particular
county
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
in
1947,
it's
changed
radically
too.
mr.
thorp
thomas
a
period
of
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
this
--
i
think
this
brings
up
to
1955,
but
it
--
some
changed
from
none
to
some.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
right.
this
is
not
the
complete
record.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
--
under
the
decision
in
patton
against
mississippi,
he
failed
to
meet
his
burden.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
--
i
think
that
he
said
this,
that
he
asked
mr.
meade,
who
is
the
county
clerk,
"was
there
any
other
record?"
and
mr.
meade
said,
i
don't
have
any
other
record
that
would
indicate
and
don't
i
think
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
he
went
any
--
i
don't
think
he
searched
any
further
than
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
sir?
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
believe
the
sheriff's
office.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
sir.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
sir.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
don't
have
that
statute
but
the
statute
on
summoning
the
jurors,
they
have
to
have
a
summons
with
their
name
on
it
and
their
address
which
is
kept
from
the
record
in
the
sheriff's
office,
and
i
say
this,
that
this
record
could
have
been
complete
with
a
little
more
--
if
he
had
just
gotten
that
in
then
we'd
have
a
complete
picture
of
it.
and
i'll
confess,
i'm
as
ignorant
of
the
true
facts
as
anyone,
but
i
do
know
this,
that
this
list
are
the
number
that
he
say
actually
served,
actually
appeared
that's
true,
i'll
accept
his
testimony
on
that,
but
i'll
say
this,
it
is
not
the
actual
number
who
were
selected.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
your
honor
it
was
the
same
record
that
--
that
he
had
searched.
mr.
thorp
thomas
it
was
the
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
it
was
the
record
from
the
clerk's
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
office.
sir?
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
had
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
the
judge
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
sir.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
the
record
that
he
was
attempting
to
have
this
other
gentleman
testify
from,
was
the
record
from
the
county
clerk's
office
which
is
the
identical
record
that
he
had
searched
and
already
knew
the
numbers,
so
in
order
to
expedite
the
trial
the
judge
asked
him
haven't
you
searched
the
same
record
and
he
said,
"yes."
"well,
put
to
testimony
on
by
yourself
otherwise
we'll
have
to
sit
here
while
this
man
reads
some
40
pages
of
records."
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
sir.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
think
that
it
would
possibly
maybe
not
over
two
or
three
more
on
each
panel.
i
wouldn't
venture
more
than
that.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true.
and
it
might
show
four,
five
or
six,
white
that
didn't
come
too?
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
would
think
so.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
doubt
it.
mr.
thorp
thomas
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
for
me
to
base
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
ordinarily
if
it
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
if
there's
a
lot
of
feeling
about
it,
the
answer
would
be
yes,
they
would
summon
more.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
--
that's
true
and
then
of
course
if
a
perspective
juror
on
his
voir
dire
examination
would
say
that
he
does
believe
in
capital
punishment,
why,
he'd
be
crossed
off
and
so
it
does
take
a
greater
amount
of
veniremen
for
a
capital
case.
mr.
thorp
thomas
sir?
mr.
thorp
thomas
we
have
special,
what
we
call
special
panels
that
are
picked
by
the
jury
commissioners
at
the
same
time
they
select
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes.
there
are
always
--
a
list
is
always
available
and
then
of
course
if
something
like
this
is
coming
up
then
they
can't
summon.
but
i
think
possibly
that
this
case
stands
pretty
much
in
the
same
situation,
that
united
states
against
brant
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio
which
was
a
1955
case,
139
f.
supp.
where
we
are
making
the
same
claim
as
they
are
making
here
that
negroes
as
a
class
were
excluded
from
jury
service.
however,
in
the
brant
case
the
record
was
clear
that
throughout
the
years
covered
by
the
evidence
colored
persons
were
represented
on
the
jury
list
and
actually
served
as
jurors
in
the
cases
and
that's
the
same
thing
that
we
have
here.
the
court
said
to
sustain
this
claim.
defendant's
relied
in
part
on
the
fact
that
no
member
of
the
indicting
grand
jury
was
a
negro
that
their
contention
that
this
evidence
--
that
this
is
evidence
of
discrimination
is
void
of
merit,
because
it's
well
settled
and
an
accused
person
is
not
entitled
to
have
a
jury
composed
and
in
part
of
persons
who
are
members
of
the
his
own
race
nor
is
anyone
entitled
to
that.
and
then
they
cite
the
martin
against
texas
in
200
us
and
akins
against
texas
in
325
u.s.
now
to
--
i
think
that
the
akins
case
is
probably
the
complete
answer
to
this
one.
and
the
language
of
this
court
in
that
case
is
that
petitioner's
sole
objection
to
the
grand
jury
is
that
the
commissioners
deliberately
and
intentionally
and
purposefully
limited
number
of
the
negro
race
that
should
be
selected
on
same
said
--
grand
jury
panel
to
one
member.
now,
that's
what
he
is
saying
here
that
that
we
are
systematic
--
we
have
systematic
inclusion
rather
than
systematic
exclusion.
and
this
court
said
fairness
in
selection
has
never
been
held
to
require
proportional
representation
of
races
upon
the
jury
citing
virginia
against
rives
and
thomas
against
texas.
this
court
further
said
our
direct
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
sir.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
am
sure
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
i
mean,
i
think
what
he
is
saying
though
that
the
fact
that
the
number
of
negroes
were
so
small
on
the
jury
panels
that
that
would
show
inclusion,
systematic
inclusion
but
to
follow
that
line
of
reasoning
further
then
the
only
way
a
state
could
ever
prove
that
it
--
there
was
not
systematic
inclusion
would
--
then
you'd
have
to
go
the
proportionate
basis.
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
seems
to
be
objecting
though
because
we
are
not
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
he
seems
to
be
objecting
though
your
honor
that
we
haven't
included
enough.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
it's
still
the
state's
contention
that
he
has
not
met
his
burden
of
proof
because
we
don't
know
how
many.
there
are
actually
--
that
they
were
actually
selected
and
the
only
way
we
can
arrive
at
any
figure
on
that
would
be
by
speculation
and
conjecture
because
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
when
a
--
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
and
i
think
to
prove,
to
prove
his
claim
then
he
must
show
how
many
were
actually
selected,
not
how
many
actually
served,
which
is
all
his
record
shows
here.
and
if
it
were
like
you,
your
example
there
just
one
every
time
then
i'd
agree
with
you
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well
i
mean
if
you
are
ever
going
to
prove
that
discrimination
then
i
think
you
must
show
the
actual
numbers
that
were
selected
because
the
discrimination
lies
in
the
selection
rather
than
in
the
serving.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i'd
say
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
i'd
say
the
petitioner
had
a
much
stronger
case
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
you
mean
from
a
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
the
number
that
we
are
actually
served
rather
than
from
the
number
that
was
selected?
mr.
thorp
thomas
i'm
afraid
that
i'd
probably
have
to
infer
that
there
was
some
discrimination.
mr.
thorp
thomas
you
mean,
with
the
same
number
of
qualified
electors?
mr.
thorp
thomas
probably
wouldn't.
i'd
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
petitioner's
confessions.
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
to
--
set
out
the
grounds
that
--
believed
that
it
was
coerced.
well,
the
petitioner's
grounds,
he
alleges
one
that
he
was
mentally
retarded,
that
he
was
arrested
without
a
warrant,
that
he
was
interrogated
constantly,
that
he
was
deprived
food,
threatened
by
mobs
and
that
he
was
held
incommunicado
and
that
the
chief
of
police
had
threatened
to
arrest
all
the
members
of
his
family
if
he
didn't
confess.
now,
if
all
these
things
were
true
then
i
would
not
hesitate
to
tell
this
court
they
should
reverse
it
because
in
my
mind
it
would
coercion.
but
the
only
thing
that
i
know
to
do
in
explaining
these
things
is
go
to
the
record
and
see
what
the
testimony
is.
and
mr.
branton
--
i
believe
all
of
the
facts
as
he
gave
them
was
based
on
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
and
since
he
was
on
trial
for
his
life
he
might
be
excused
some
latitude
in
his
testimony.
now,
to
go
to
the
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
all
right,
there's
only
one
and
that
is
a
testimony
of
the
chief
of
police
when
he
told
the
petitioner
he
was
the
--
the
chief
of
police
was
on
cross-examination,
was
asked
by
mr.
branton,
“did
you
tell
the
petitioner
that
30
or
40
people
were
likely
to
be
there
in
a
few
minutes?
and
he
said,
“i
said
there
could
possibly
be
that
many
and
there
possibly
would
be.”
now,
i
frankly
and
in
all
truthfulness
do
not
know
whether
he
meant
they
were
coming
there
to
witness
the
confession,
that
they
were
--
that
he
told
them
there
was
a
mob
outside,
the
record
to
me
is
not
clear
but
that
is
the
only
questionable
incident
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
in
this
whole
record
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
about
five
minutes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
record
69,
it's
about
12
lines
down,
question
is,
“state
whether
or
not
you
told
him,
the
defendant,
there
might
be
30
or
40
people
there
in
the
next
few
minutes?”
answer
“i
said
it
was
possible.”
now,
to
me
that
is
the
only
piece
of
evidence
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
on
record
page
69.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
now
this
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
what
did
the
petitioner
say,
he
said
that
there
was
--
that
the
chief
of
police
told
him
that
there
were
30
or
40
people
that
wanted
to
get
in
there
to
get
him,
i
believe
is
the
way
he
put
it.
mr.
thorp
thomas
to
my
knowledge
this
is
at
--
on
page
69.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
believe
128.
mr.
thorp
thomas
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
question
“what
caused
you
to
be
afraid,
frank?”
answer
“well,
it
was
the
conversation
that
chief
norman
young
was
talking,
when
he
said,
30
or
40
peoples
outside.”
then
from
the
conversation
of
this
officer
down
at
dumas
and
the
way
he
was
talking,
in
other
words.
he
says
peoples,
it
were
somebody
outside
and
were
someone
that
was
outside
wanting
to
get
in
to
me.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
happened
a
different
night,
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
mr.
thorp
thomas
this,
but
this
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
only
as
to
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
-
what
is
in
the
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
what
happened
at
dumas
is
fairly,
clearly
happened
a
night
later.
there
is
--
there
is
just,
i
mean
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
just
abundant
on
that.
mr.
thorp
thomas
what
occurred
at
dumas
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
was
after
the
confession.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
and
i
have
the
record
cited
to
show
what
happened
after
the
confession
at
58,
60,
66,
90,
91
and
106.
now,
at
record
91,
now
this
is
petitioner
testifying,
he
forgot
himself
here
and
he
--
what
was
this
statement
the
man
said
you
about
hanging
somebody?
answer
“and
the
petitioner
has
testified
and
he
has
mental
lapse
here,
he
wasn't
on
guard,
while
he
was
questioning
me,
as
i
said
before,
he
was
questioning
me,
had
i
confessed
that
i
did
it,
and
i
told
him,
yes,
i
had.”
mr.
thorp
thomas
128.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
sir.
mr.
thorp
thomas
page
69.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
believe
it
was
the
--
mr.
branton
was
cross-examining
the
chief
on
that
point.
mr.
thorp
thomas
at
--
that
state
whether
or
not
--
it's
about
the
--
about
12
lines
down
on
page
69.
“state
whether
or
not
you
told
him,
the
defendant,
there
might
be
30
or
40
people
there
in
the
next
few
minutes.”
and
chief
young
answered,
“i
said
it
was
possible.”
mr.
thorp
thomas
well
now,
it
goes
on
here
is
the
reason
that
i
have
a
question
about
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
to
my
knowledge
he
didn't,
this
is
it.
he
just
says,
“i
said
it
was
possible.”
and
i
think
another
place
in
the
record
somewhere,
he
was
testifying
about
it
and
he
says,
“i
said
it
was
possible
there
could
be
that
many.”
and
he
said,
“it
was
possible
there
would
have
been
that
many.”
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
the
chief
of
police.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
that's
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
--
that's
the
only
thing
i
think
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
that
you
might
infer
any
--
any
course
from
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
would
be
the
only
statement
in
the
whole
record.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
right.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
then
he
goes
on
right
on
page
69
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
what
i
--
i
wish
you
would
note
mr.
justice
black,
how
this
question
is
phrased
on
page
69.
you'll
notice
that
he
doesn't
mention
anything
that
30
or
40
people
to
go
in
there
to
get
you,
he
said
there'd
be
30
or
40
people
there
in
a
few
minutes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
now,
there
were
several
people
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
that
did
come
in
after
this
confession
who
witnessed
it.
now,
i
don't
personally
know
and
can't
gain
from
the
record
whether
the
--
the
chief
was
referring
to
the
witnesses
or
he
actually
did
say
something
about
a
mob.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
i
believe
you're
on
a
different
page.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
i
was
talking
about
page
69.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
128.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
that
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
only
the
part
says,
wanting
to
get
in
to.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
is
what
i
get
out
from
page
69
because
when
you
come
on
down
and
read
in
context
without
taking
it
out
of
context.
if
you
take
it
out
of
context,
it
looks
--
you
don't
know.
but,
if
you
go
on
down
close
to
the
bottom
of
--
that's
the
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true,
he
--
he
had
--
he
--
in
his
testimony,
the
sheriff
said,
i
had
promised
frank,
the
petitioner,
that
he
could
make
this
confession
to
me
in
private
and
he
kept
his
promise
and
he
wouldn't
let
anyone
else
in,
he
testified
until
he
got
frank's
permission.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
don't
think
so
if
you
read
it
in
context.
on
69,
right
after
he
says,
“i
said
it
was
possible.”
“did
you
go
downstairs
to
your
office?”
“yes.”
“was
his
confession
interrupted?”
says,
“it
was
by
a
knock
on
the
door,”
and
he
went
to
the
door,
he
said
the
then
sheriff
and
a
state
trooper
were
at
the
door.
“did
you
permit
them
to
come
in?”
"i
did
not.”
“did
you
tell
them
anything
about
the
defendant?”
he
said,
“i
told
them
that
he
was
making
an
oral
confession.”
and
said
then,
“did
he
complete
his
confession
roughly,
then
what
you
do?”
“i
asked
him
if
he
would
mind
the
sheriff
and
sergeant
halsell
to
come
in.”
“how
much
later
was
that?”
he
says,
“not
more
than
five
minutes.”
question
“then,
did
the
other
people
come
in?”
connect
it
back
up
here,
there
would
be
30
or
40
there,
reading
it
directly
in
context.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
do
not.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
think
it
was.
mr.
thorp
thomas
for
--
for
this
reason.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
don't
think
possibly
the
statement
as
you
put
it
was
not
denied
as
such,
but
during
chief
young's
testimony,
he
explained
it
in
a
different
way,
i
mean
answered
the
questions
in
a
different
way
where
you
could
possibly
draw
any
inference
you
want
to,
you
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
the
reason
that
i
think
that
it
wasn't
coerced
is
his
subsequent
demeanor
after
that.
that
is
shown
by
the
testimony
of
the
court
reporter
and
the
other
witnesses
to
the
effect
that,
well,
a
few
minutes
later,
here
he
is
testifying,
and
he
was
watching
the
court
reporter
to
takes
the
notes
in
shorthand,
and
he
is
very
careful
not
to
talk
too
fast,
so
she'll
get
everything
down
that
he
is
saying.
mr.
thorp
thomas
and
he
shows
no
outward
signs
of
fear,
and
that
would
lead
me
to
believe
that
there
is
just
no
substance
to
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
the
argument
of
a
coerced
confession.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
it
depends
on
whose
testimony
you're
going
to
believe,
the
chief
of
police
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
they
didn't
deny
it
as
such.
mr.
thorp
thomas
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
shows
whether
he
was
fed
or
not.
the
--
chief
young
testified
that
the
first
meal
in
the
morning
at
the
jail
was
at
8,
the
evening
meal
started
around
between
4
and
5.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
sir,
but
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
the
--
the
record
positively
shows
that
he
was
fed
two
sandwiches
or
at
least
one,
by
his
own
testimony,
at
noon
that
day.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that
after
he
came
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
after
they
had
finished
taken
the
lie
detector
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
he
was
arrested
on
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
11
o'clock
on
wednesday
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
was
arrested
on
wednesday,
the
sandwiches
were
on
thursday
noon
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
when
--
that
was
after
he
had
completed
the
lie
detector
test,
and
was
turned
back
over
to
the
police
officer.
they
fed
him
and
returned
him
to
pine
bluff,
where
he
was
placed
in
jail
for
the
remainder
of
the
night,
which
would
indicate
to
me
that
he
was
there
at
the
time
that
the
food
was
served.
certainly
he
was
there
the
next
morning,
because
he
wasn't
taken
out
of
that
cell
until
he
wanted
to
confess
at
approximately
1
o'clock
on
friday.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
don't
know
whether
they
could
prove
it
your
honor
or
not.
as
i
say
i
wasn't
in
that
phase
of
the
case,
i
have
only
been
connected
with
it
during
the
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
there
is
nothing
--
i
will
say
that
very
frankly
there's
nothing
in
the
record
any
direct
testimony
that
would
reflect
anything
to
the
contrary
other
than
what
the
petitioner
said.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
your
honor
may
i
say
you
this.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
--
reading
the
record,
and
staying
strictly
with
the
record,
i
have
not
drawn
the
same
conclusions
from
this
that
you
have,
like
you
say
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
where
he
is
dragged
around
the
contrary
without
any
shoes,
he
was
merely
taken
from
pine
bluff
to
little
rock
without
shoes
where
he
was
given
shoes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
the
officer
testified
that
--
officer
halsell
testified
that
he
gave
him
the
shoes
immediately
upon
his
arrival
at
state
police
headquarters
that
morning.
now,
it
was
the
petitioner
who
said
that
he
didn't
receive
the
shoes
until
4:30
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
i
say
according
to
the
record
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
if
the
facts
were
as
you
stated
to
me,
then
my
answer
would
have
been
different.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
don't
think
that
one
factor
alone
would
affect
it.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
because
i'm
very
(inaudible)
myself
voluntarily.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well
now,
on
the
--
on
the
morning
--
on
that
friday
morning,
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
dispute
in
a
record
that
he
was
placed
back
in
the
jail
on
his
return
from
little
rock,
for
the
remainder
of
the
night.
they
had
to
put
him
there
the
next
morning.
i
mean,
he
had
to
be
in
jail
the
next
morning
during
the
time
they
served
breakfast.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
by
his
own
testimony
he
said
the
reason
i
confessed
is
because
i
was
afraid
of
what
the
sheriff
told
me
and
what
the
jailer
at
dumas
told
me.
he
never
once
says
in
his
testimony
that
the
reason
he
confessed
was
because
he
was
hungry.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
he
said
he
had
two
sandwiches
and
the
coke
and
a
candy
bar
and
some
peanuts
and
testified
that
sergeant
halsell,
although
he
had
had
breakfast,
now
this
was
in
dumas
that
morning
in
jail,
sergeant
halsell,
he
told
him
he
was
still
hungry
and
he
stopped
outside
of
dumas
and
bought
him
ham
and
eggs
and
milk.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well
that
was
--
apparently
after
--
that
was
after
he
had
confessed,
that
was
at
dumas.
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
he
also
fed
him,
the
day
that
he
had
him
in
little
rock,
of
course
there
is
no
--
it
is
like
you
say
there
is
no
testimony
to
the
contrary,
to
contradict
that
he
said
he
wasn't
fed.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
the
record
will
reflect
that
he
was
given
more
then
just
the
two
sandwiches.
mr.
thorp
thomas
by
his
own
testimony,
he
says
in
there
that
besides
that
that
he
was
given
a
candy
bar,
that
he
was
given
some
peanuts
and
on
his
own
testimony
he
said
that
the
jailer
threatened
him
in
dumas
before
he
confessed
and
that
he
goes
in
all
that
that
he
was
fed
before
he
was
confessed.
of
course,
that
isn't
true
because
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
true
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
but
he
still
received
--
he
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
no.
he
didn't
say
he
got
it
in
dumas,
he
said
he
got
it
in
the
jail.
mr.
thorp
thomas
sergent
halsell
purchased
that
for
him
outside
of
dumas.
mr.
thorp
thomas
i
--
i
don't
quite
follow
you
judge
whittaker.
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
no.
he
--
he
admitted
that
he
killed
the
man.
but
he
said
he
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
said
he
did
it
in
a
sudden
heat
of
passion.
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
your
--
no
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
there
is
much
at
this
recording
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
self
defense
and
sudden
heat
of
passion,
there
were
two
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
(inaudible)
there.
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
said
the
--
i
believe
that
that
wasn't
the
truth,
and
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
in
his
behalf,
that
he
did
repudiate
the
confession.
mr.
thorp
thomas
it
may
--
it
may
not
--
you
mean,
how
does
his
testimony
differ
from
his
plea
of
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
it
doesn't
itself
in
that
sense.
as
i
remember
the
record,
he
said
that
the
confession
he
made
was
not
true
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
said,
“what
is
the
truth?”
and
on
objection
by
mr.
branton
the
court
stopped
the
prosecutor
from
pursuing
that
line
of
questioning
any
further.
and
i
believe
that
testimony
was
taken
in
chambers
possibly
at
around
91.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
but
it
is
not
in
this
record.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
thorp
thomas
that's
correct.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
sir.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes,
it
is
in
this
one
and
the
other
one
too
and
the
typewritten,
it's
in
both
of
them.
mr.
thorp
thomas
well,
he
took
the
officer's
--
very
frankly
admitted
that
he
took
it,
he
took
them
to
where
he
had
it
hidden
in
a
piano.
mr.
thorp
thomas
and
also
there's
some
other
testimony
and
i
don't
know
whether
it's
in
this
particular
record
or
in
the
typewritten.
mr.
thorp
thomas
yes.
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
even
took
them,
the
officers
to
the
spot
that
he
thrown
the
iron
rod
where
he
crushed
his
employer's
skull
and
point
out
this
is
where
i
threw
it
and
that's
where
a
man
had
found
it.
there
was
an
ample
independent
evidence
which
he
can
--
been
convicted
of
--
mr.
thorp
thomas
--
other
than
the
confession.
mr.
thorp
thomas
no,
he
did
never
deny
making
the
confession.
mr.
thorp
thomas
he
said
that
that
wasn't
the
truth,
but
i
don't
think
he
--
in
any,
in
the
other
record
the
typewritten
record,
he
tells
his
story
that
is
different
than
the
confession.
thank
you.
