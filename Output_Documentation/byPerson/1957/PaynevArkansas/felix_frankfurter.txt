(inaudible)
was
the
practice
stopped
voluntarily
or
because
of
some
(inaudible)
justice
felix

there
wasn't
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
branton,
i'd
rather
go
on
the
inference
over
the
years
in
cases
that
have
come
before
us
the
things
that
are
not
in
the
record,
the
documents
therefore,
nevertheless,
taking
into
account
of
my
--
as
a
matter
of
practice,
it
would
make
(inaudible)
i'm
told
they
can't
fight
specifically,
take
it
outside
the
record
in
the
usual
sense
of
that
phrase.
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this,
whether
you
and
attorney
general
would
agree
on
whether
or
not
in
practice
of
--
practice
that
happens
to
be
common,
it
was
found
that
negroes
on
the
whole
if
they
are
summoned
are
more
likely
that
they
asked
to
be
excused
than
white
folks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
maybe,
if
one
gets
going
on
this,
that
maybe
because
they
are
selected
because
they
would
(inaudible)
that
may
well
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
testimony
about
the
shoes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
your
cross-examination?
what
is
it?
that's
your
cross-examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
a
normal
climate,
is
that
it,
any
normal
climate
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
also
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
the
extraordinary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
to
infer
that
a
(inaudible)
cross-examiner
like
you
have
asked
some
questions
as
to
the
fact
he's
been
taken
naked
to
little
rock.
is
that
a
fair
inference
to
be
drawn?
is
this
considering
the
purpose
of
the
court's
examination?
would
i
be
stretching
much
to
assume
that
you
would
not
have
missed
the
chance
to
prove,
they
took
him
naked
to
the
indignity
that
that
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly
that
did
you
ask
--
if
you
had
thought
he
would,
you
would
have
thought
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
did
you
happen
to
know
the
exact
date
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
in
mississippi.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
pursue
this,
(inaudible)
is
relevant,
it
comes
to
my
mind
(inaudible)
now,
what
is
the
relevance
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that
is
not
questioned
that
that
took
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
is
not
questioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
preceded
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
cannot
find
anything
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
somebody's
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
vital
thing
is
when
he
was
taken,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
there
was
testimony
one
way
by
the
state
and
another
way
by
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this,
whether
this
conflicting
--
from
--
to
verify
it
from
my
point
of
view,
highly
damaging
testimony,
was
this
conflict
developed
before
the
judge's
chamber
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
have
him
decide
(inaudible)
let
it
go
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
and
that
again
was
testified
before
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
state
the
merits
of
that
argument,
what
you
regard
as
uncontradicted,
a
non-conflicting
testimony
in
which
from
your
point
of
view
--
from
your
point
of
view
establishes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
summarily
in
part,
one
item
after
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
--
you
--
you
said
also
the
day
before,
he
didn't
have
lunch
or
did
he
have
no
food
or
when
did
he
have
food,
did
he
not
have
--
did
not
breakfast
at
little
rock
and
before
he
was
taken
to
little
rock
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
gave
him
breakfast
later?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
he
was
kept
without
food,
am
i
to
infer
-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
no
food,
suppose
you
state
what
food
he
did
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
instead
of
having
me
ask
what
he
didn't
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
stop
you
long
enough
to
either
tell
me,
to
explain
what
is
meant
by
his
answer,
"well,
they
had
other
reasons."
(inaudible)
as
to
other
reasons
serving,
how
would
that
a,
what
kind
of
other
reasons
and
b,
how
would
those
other
reasons
be
communicated
to
the
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
say,
i
asked
some
other
reasons
for
not
taking
this,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
just
answered
the
chief
justice
as
to
how
few
they
were,
so
that
takes
care
of
the
two,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
can
understand
all
that.
that
was
the
four
point
of
my
question
to
your
brother.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
basis
have
we
pursued
that
there
were
these
rejections
or
non-acceptance
or
non-calling
on
such
grounds?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
for
reason
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
last
word,
as
in,
responsible
citizen
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
county.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
there's
any
difference
in
the
selection
of
juries
between
criminal
cases
and
civil
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
easy
for
you
to
state
what
the
records
would
show
roughly
in
civil
cases
down
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
taking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
this
county
do
you
have
to
know
what
the
showing
would
be
to
civil
cases
where
juries
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
what
inference
do
you
think
is
allowed
if
any
inference
is
allowed
from
the
fact
that
in
a
county
in
which
the
population
between
colored
and
--
white
and
colored
is
about
half
and
half,
as
it
is
in
this
county
and
the
process
by
which
jurors
get
on
panels
runs
over
a
course
of
years
from
30
to
60,
as
to
white
and
never
more
than
six,
only
one
as
i
noticed
it,
runs
from
zero
to
normally
two,
what
inference
is
allowable
that
there
is
not
operating
an
individualized
judgment
each
year
for
some
predisposition
in
the
selection
of
people
which
already
makes
a
classification
that
they
want
more
whites
than
of
colored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you
what
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
inference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
difference
couldn't
be
much,
the
margin
of
error
couldn't
be
large,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
say
four,
it
runs
never
at
--
on
the
average
of
four
a
year,
it's
much
less,
i'm
giving
the
figures
but
the
negroes
(inaudible)
let
us
say
the
average
of
negroes
is
never
above
four,
and
the
average
of
whites
is
never
below
13,
what
inference
is
allowable
if
any,
this
is
not
an
argument,
this
is
a
real
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
even
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
say
qualified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
--
does
the
record
show
what
the
base
of
--
what
the
pool
from
which
whites
and
coloreds
are
drawn
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
rules
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
and
what
your
--
your
state's
position,
it
seems
that
the
state's
position,
that
merely
on
the
face
of
the
petition,
the
pool
of
white
people,
pool
of
colored
people,
having
the
disparity
of
which
you
refer.
merely
on
the
face
of
the
figures,
in
the
light
of
no
human
testimony
that
in
fact
biased,
determined
the
selection,
the
elements
that
enter
into
the
area
of
judgment
is
open
to
the
jury
commissioners,
might
well
work
out
this
way,
is
that
the
statement
--
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
--
no
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
am
merely
suggesting
that
--
that
in
one
or
two
cases,
the
dice
should
always
fall
the
same
way.
and
if
one
assumes
what
is
required
is
a
judgment
subject
to
all
the
non-provable
fair
basis
of
discretion,
there
shouldn't
enter
consciously
or
unconsciously
--
consciously
or
unconsciously
an
exclusionary
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
intent
is
a
--
is
an
ultimate
judgment
of
inference
on
a
lot
of
non-demonstrable
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
any
--
have
you
--
do
you
happen
to
have
any
light
on
why
from
1947
to
1955,
figures
on
the
whole
run
pretty
uniformly
except
in
(inaudible)
there
are
considerable
variances,
64
(inaudible)
the
total
number
of
jurors
is
white,
64
in
1950,
54
in
1951,
(inaudible)
and
then
65,
1958.
which
is
considered
the
smallest
of
the
number,
the
percentage
of
increases
from
the
average
is
enormous
rather
considerably.
do
you
happen
to
have
any
reasons
why
that
in
march
(inaudible)
there
were
64,
in
the
october
term,
49
--
i
mean,
32.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
got
anything
to
do
with
it,
this
october?
i
noticed
that
--
that
is
true
because
two
of
the
increased
numbers
happen
to
be
in
october,
two
in
march
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
more
before
there's
more
peremptory
challenges.
well,
you
got
to
have
more
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
systematic
inclusion
isn't
allowed,
isn't
it,
the
legal
doctrine,
all
that
was
meant
(inaudible)
that
you
do
not
satisfy
--
do
not
disapprove
prohibitive
discrimination
by,
saying,
“well,
we'll
have
one
negro
or
two.”
in
any
event
that
will
--
that
will
satisfy
the
requirement
or
disprove
on
this
way
the
systematic
discrimination.
you
can't
--
he
wouldn't
object
having
systematically
included
more
negroes
than
--
than
anybody
mathematically
required
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wasn't
objecting
that
--
he
wouldn't
be
here
though
we've
had
a
case
there
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that's
a
discrimination,
that
the
inclusion
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
do
not
disapprove
this
claim
of
intentional
discrimination
by
saying,
“well
look,
each
term
is
quite
so
--
that
each
term
we
did
that,
one
negro,
do
not
satisfy
the
principle
of
inadmissible
exclusion
by
including
a
(inaudible)
colored
man?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
this
--
i
am
not
saying
that
this
--
that
this
case,
i'm
saying
that
its
position,
your
answer
is
that
he
has
a
burden
of
showing
no
matter
what
the
figures
show
that
the
figures
are
of
the
result
with
the
intention
of
keeping
out
colored
people
from
service,
who
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
be
on
the
panel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
--
could
you
quickly
turn
to
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
on
this
very
point,
what
is
his
comment
of
these
30
or
40
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
128.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
officer
down
at
dumas,
that's
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
and
that
you
say
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
there
a
--
is
that
also
unquestioned,
is
there
also
agreement
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
of
the
confession,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
state
couldn't,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
result
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
will
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
and
there's
no
controversy
that
the
chief
of
police
said
something
about
30
or
40
people
in
the
next
few
minutes,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
isn't
quite
regarding
the
testimony
because
the
action
to
include
not
only
the
connotation
that
chief
norman
young
but
also
of
that
officer
at
dumas,
can
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
page
128.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
that
when
a
(inaudible)
i
understand
that
the
chief
of
your
argument
is
the
chief
of
police
simply
says,
30
people
there
in
the
next
few
minutes
without
saying
what
the
people
were
there
for,
what
their
purpose
was,
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
that's
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i'm
--
i'm
turning
to
what
the
petitioner
has
made
on
page
28
--
128.
and
the
petitioner
gets
in
the
phrase
to
get
--
to
get
into
me,
he
concludes
that
act
referring
not
only
what
chief
norman
young
said
there,
but
also
what
the
officer
down
at
dumas
said.
