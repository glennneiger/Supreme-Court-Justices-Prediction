they?
chief

well
then,
in
the
year
1954
there
were
two
terms,
march
1954
and
there
was
only
one
negro
who
would
have
disqualified
himself
for
that
year
because
he
was
the
only
one
called
and
in
the
october
term
there
were
none
called.

if
you're

if
you're
summoned

excused
before
you
respond
to
the
summons
you
haven't
been
on
the
jury,
have
you?
chief

that's
part
of
the
testimony,
is
it?
that's

that's
a
query,
isn't
it,
and
not
a
testimony
on

the
court?
chief

well,
he
doesn't
know
it.
chief

i'm
asking
proof
that
there

we
have
to

this

mr.

you
didn't

it
down

but
(voice

--
chief

they
didn't
contest
it.
chief

they
wouldn't
even

they
wouldn't
even
let
a
state
officer
give
the
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
different
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
doesn't
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
in
about
16
or
18
terms
of
the
court
over
a
period
of
nine
--
nine
years,
that
once
there
was
six,
another
time
there
were
four
negroes
and
on
no
other
occasion
was
there
more
than
two
and
on
the
good
many
of
the
times
there
was
one
and
several
times
none
on
the
panel
out
of
5774
qualified
electors,
doesn't
seem
to
you
a
little
strange
that
that
would
become
the
pattern
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that
would
be
the
--
the
extent
to
which
any
one
of
those
--
those
panels
would
have
colored
people
on
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
you
--
could
you
give
me
some
rationale
explanation
of
the
october
1954
term
which
is
the
same
as
about
five
others
in
that
there
are
no
negroes
on
the
panel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
october
1954.
they
had
39
--
39
whites
on
that
jury
and
not
a
single
negro,
now
would
you
just
give
me
some
rationale
explantation
as
to
how
that
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
happen
if
they
were
trying
to
give
a
cross-section
of
the
--
of
the
county
in
--
in
establishing
this
jury
panel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
have
no
evidence
in
here
that
there
were
any
so
excused.
you
have
a
question
by
the
judge,
but
there
is
no
testimony
in
this
record
as
i
see
it
that
any
negroes
were
excused
before
they
came
in
here
to
respond
to
the
--
to
the
subpoena.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
only
answer
you
have
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
make
any
effort
to
show
what
the
--
what
the
true
picture
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
public
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
required
by
the
statute
to
be
kept
in
the
sheriff's
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
statute
quoted
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
that
he
tried
to
prove
this
through
the
sheriff's
office
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
judge
wouldn't
permit
him
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
that
a
particular
record,
they
wanted
him
to
consult
the
records
and
find
out
how
many
it
was,
and
the
judge
said
that'll
take
too
much
time,
we
can't
do
that,
you
do
it,
you've
made
an
investigation
of
these
records,
you
use
--
you
use
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
information.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
he's
trying
to
get
it
from
the
sheriff,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
try
to
get?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
other
side
of
this

chief

the
other
side
of
this
involves
of
any
such

trying
to
maintain
the
said
principle,
don't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
as
i
understood
mr.
branton,
he
said
he
didn't
make
any
such
contention
on
his
brief,
(inaudible)
the
brief
excludes
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thomas
before
you
sit
down,
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
the
proof,
the
lack
of
proof?
now
as
i
understood
mr.
branton,
as
i
understand
the
briefs,
this
man
was
arrested
at
about
10
o'clock
wednesday
morning.
he
was
given
no
food
on
wednesday,
he
was
given
the
sandwich,
i
think,
your
witnesses
say
two
sandwiches
on
--
at
noon
on
thursday,
and
then
nothing
more
to
eat
until
after
he
--
after
he
confessed
on
friday
afternoon.
now,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
took
him
by
6
o'clock
to
little
rock.
chief
justice
earl

he
had
no
breakfast.

on

i
understood
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thursday
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
testified
--
he
testified
that
he
did
not
receive
any
food
and
although
the
state
took
notice
of
that,
all
they
would
say
was
that
he
was
in
the
building
when
the
others
were
fed.
chief

earl

but
that's
all
that
--
that
that's
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
now
do
you
not
--
do
you
not
think
that
a
19-year-old
man,
whatever
you
want
to
call
him
or
a
boy,
whichever
it
is,
who
was
thrown
into
jail
and
held
for
26
hours,
without
any
food,
and
then
is
given
one
or
two
sandwiches.
and
then
this
questions
off
and
on
for
another
26
hours
or
so
before
he's
given
any
more
food.
and
half
of
the
time
without
even
any
shoes
on,
dragged
around
the
country.
do
you
not
think
that
that
has
some
effect
upon
his
--
his
mental
condition
and
his
willingness
to
--
to
do
what
the
police
wanted
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
good
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
as
i
read
the
record,
your
own
witnesses
said
that
his
shoes
were
taken
from
him
about
6:30
in
the
morning
and
then
they
took
him
to
little
rock
and
they
gave
him
some
shoes
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
made
a
mistake
about
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
just
--
let's
leave
the
shoes
out
of
it,
and
just
take
that
food
conversation.
do
you
not
--
do
you
think
that
that
to
his
conduct
compatible
with
free
and
voluntary
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
well,
how
about
--
how
about
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
that
factor
coupled
with
the
other
one,
to
the
effect
that
the
sheriff
told
him
that
there
were
30
or
40
people
out
there
and
he
tried
to
protect
him.
would
that
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
doesn't
prove
that
they
gave
him
any
breakfast.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there's
--
there
is
no
one
for
the
state
who
testified
that
they
did
give
him
any
breakfast.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
one
who
testified
that
any
if
at
all
except
those
two
sandwiches
26
hours
after
he
was
arrested.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
testified
the
fact
that
he
didn't
get
any
food,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ham
and
eggs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that,
after
his
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that
makes
a
difference,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
that's
the
reason
why
i
--
i
asked
you
whether
there
isn't
more
than
just
the
one
point,
you
say
the
only
issue
in
the
case,
as
you
see
it
is
what
the
sherriff
is
supposed
to
have
told
him
just
beforehand.
but
you
don't
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
this
young
was
kept
in
jail
and
questioned
and
night
and
day
at
various
times,
i
don't
say
continuously,
and
that
he
was
given
no
food,
except
one
or
two
sandwiches
over
a
period
of
more
than
two
day.
chief
justice

--

things
