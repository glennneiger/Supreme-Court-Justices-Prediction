black
is
that
accumulated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
the
names
appear
if
they
were
paid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
there
are
many
of
them
who
were
called
for
that
obligation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
require
that
they
be
paid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
statute
or
any
practice
shown
under
which
the
clerk
can
fail
to
put
their
name
on
the
payroll
record
if
they're
summoned
and
appear?
justice
hugo

i
suppose

i
suppose
you
wouldn't
deny
that
that
sometimes
occur.

what's
the

(inaudible)
justice

what
did
you
say
about

according
to
the

it's
undisputed.

that

justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

did
they
say
what
happened
after
the
confession?
justice
hugo

black
what
did
the
jailer
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
just
started
about
the
police,
the
chief
of
police.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
chief
of
police
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
before
it
(inaudible)
justice

black
did
you
--
did
you
mean
if
arkansas
had
shown
there
had
been
only
one
colored
man
in
15
years,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
--
shall
remain
on
the
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
--
there
are
some
other
points
at
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
--
those
who
were
excused,
i
noticed
because
that
figure
is
probably
the
same
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
say
is
that
the
jury
(inaudible)
maybe
a
week,
they
can't
do
this
two
weeks
before
that
time,
frequently
some
of
them
will
call
up
the
judge
or
the
clerk,
get
excused
before
they
come
to
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
come
to
court
in
response
to
the
summons,
they
are
entitled
to
their
pay,
is
it
not,
and
get
on
the
paperwork.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand,
but
we
--
we
can
accept
the
payroll.
i
didn't
mean
that
everybody
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
everybody
who
actually
appeared.
justice
hugo
l.
black
actually
appeared.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
those
who
get
excused
in
advance
(inaudible)
that's
--
they
have
to
hear
from
the
judge
to
be
excused
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
knows
how
to
go
up
there,
calls
him
up
(inaudible)
to
get
excused.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
taking
about
the
--
it's
a
small
number
that
get
excused,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
it
would
likely
be
as
many
on
one
side

black
70
degrees.
justice
hugo

black
that's
a

isn't
it?

that's
a

there.

black
january?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
have
you
looked
up
the
government
census
to
see
what
percentage
of
colored
people
in
the
county
are
educated,
to
the
highest
degree
of
education?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
unusually
low
percentage
when
they
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
that's
it.
but
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
no
race
is
entitled
to
portional
representation
on
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
we
see
in
pierre
versus
louisiana,
where
there
was
a
very
great
disproportion
or
he's
done
it
all
and
(inaudible)
that
was
shown,
the
government
and
the
state
failed
to
show
why
there
would
be
such
a
disproportion
and
it
had
(voice

to
perform
its
duties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
here,
did
they
come
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
in
all
these
years,
that
shown
each
year
they've
put
one,
would
that
be
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
when
it
consistently
gets
this

justice

black
--
this
low,
when
it
consistently
gets
this
low
in
such
a
(inaudible)
a
number
of
colored
people
there.
is
it
possible
to
draw
any
inference
that
that
would
happen
accidently
unless
you
say
that
the
jury
commissioners
just
didn't
know.
would
that
--
justice

l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo

black
haven't
we
also
said
that
if
say
they
don't
know,
they
did
not
know
(inaudible)
justice

black
well,
in
your
mind
--
justice

black
a
very,
very
small
percentage
--
justice

black
(inaudible)
of
the
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there's
no
reason
at
all,
except
to
guess
where
it
is.
as
to
why
that
should
so
consistently
happen
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
as
i
recall
it,
maybe
i
should
consider
that
case,
but
as
i
recall
it,
there
was
something
said
there
about
the
fact
that
they
had
shown
the
breaking
away
from
an
old
pattern
of
the
past.
justice

(voice

--
justice

that's
the

of

have
made
the
change.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
have
another
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
state
make
any
objection
to
this
(inaudible)
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
may
i
ask
you
now,
you
--
you
know
the
system,
have
you
any
reason
to
tell
us
some
(inaudible)
that
the
other
record
would
make
any
substantial
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
might
possibly
show
that
two
or
three
were
summoned
but
didn't
come.
justice
hugo
l.
black
probably
about
the
same
percentage
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
a
little
more
than
white.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do?
justice

black
do
you
summon
a
bigger
panel
when
you
have
capital
cases
(inaudible)
justice

l.
black
you
have
elected
--
justice

i
mean
(inaudible)
capital
cases
we
try,
can
you
summon
a
greater
number
of
jurors,
prospective
jurors
for
that
venire.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
special
venire.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it
--
why
would
this
--
that
settled
it.
people
can
be
(inaudible)
in
such
a
way
that
those
selected
could
know
in
advance
they
would
serve
and
that
has
come
up
(inaudible)
the
result.
why
therefore
do
you
say
that
that
wouldn't
--
you
have
to
show
the
number
that
you've
selected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
this
thing
could
show
--
suppose
the
whites
were
--
they
haven't
made
those
(inaudible)
would
you
say
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
that's
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
--
would
you
still
say
think
that
nobody
could
infer
from
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
no
--
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
that
--
but
supposed
it's
reversed
the
other
way
that
a
number
of
white
people
had
served
with
(inaudible)
a
number
of
colored
people
would

how
would
you
feel
about
that?
is
that
your
discrimination?
justice

(voice

just
like
in
here.
justice

black
i
want
to

i
wanted

mr.

asked
you
this

what
he

the

would
it
serve
your
argument
if
you

conceded

fact,
undisputed
fact
insofar
as
the

is

was
at
first

how
long
was
that

justice

black
how
long
was
that
supposed
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
now
what
--
where
is
the
--
the
piece
of
evidence
where
the
defendant
said
he
was
told
there
might
be
30
or
40
people
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
the
petitioner,
they
have
--
they
have
said
--
stating
there'd
be
30
or
40
people
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
say
was
the
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
chief
of
police
--
did
he
make
any
further
statements
in
this
--
about
it
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
at
--
on
page
--
at
the
top
of
page
128
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
he
said,
with
reference
to
the
same
conversation
that
the
chief
testified
about
--
chief
of
police,
chief
norman
young
said
30
or
40
people
were
outside
wanting
to
get
in
to
me.
and
he
asked
me
if
i
wanted
to
make
a
confession
he
would
try
to
keep
them
out.
did
any
--
did
the
state
ask
the
chief
whether
or
not
that
was
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
69.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
did
he
deny
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
pretty
plainly
refers
to
the
statement
that
this
man
made
that
he
said
there
were
30
or
40
people
out
there
waiting
to
get
him,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
did
the
state
ever
ask
that
the
policeman
ever
deny
it,
chief
of
police
ever
deny
it
that
other
parts
of
the
statement
that
he
made
about
the
30
or
40
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nobody
--
nobody
every
denied
the
statement
of
petitioner
that
the
chief
of
police
told
him
that
they
were
out
there
to
get
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you'd
have
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
the
fact
remains,
does
it
not,
that
you
have
a
statement
by
the
petitioner
that
he
said
--
he
said
there
were
30
or
40
people,
that
he
said
they
were
there
to
get
him,
you
have
no
denial
of
that
in
the
record
by
anybody
representing
arkansas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
the
top
of
the
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
top
of
the
page,
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
that
been
disputed
by
you
here?
he
would
try
to
keep
them
out,
has
that
been
--
has
that
been
disputed
by
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
you
have
here,
i
wish
you'd
state
whether
or
not
you
think
that
shows
the
confession
was
coerced
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let
me
ask
a
question.
you
have
undisputed
testimony
to
this
effect,
no
witnesses
deny
it.
chief
norman
young
said
30
or
40
people
were
outside
waiting
to
get
in
to
me,
and
he
asked
me
if
i
wanted
to
make
a
confession,
he
would
try
to
keep
them
out.
and
nobody
has
denied
that.
in
your
judgment,
if
that
is
true,
was
this
a
free
and
voluntary
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
with
that
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
with
that
statement
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
made
no
statement
on
(inaudible)
about
whether
this
man
--
whether
30
or
40
people
there,
the
statement
was
true,
that
he
had
told
this
young
fellow
that
there
were
30
to
40
people
out
there
waiting
to
get
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
have
to
defend
it,
do
you
not,
on
the
basis
that
this
undisputed
testimony
in
the
record.
the
chief
of
police
told
him
five
minutes
before
the
confession,
you
got
to
go
ahead
and
talk
to
the
30
or
40
out
there
waiting
to
get
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
who
denies
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
admit
or
deny
he
got
the
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
about
the
confession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
ample
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
ample
independent
evidence
was
that
he
denied
that
he
had
made
the
confession
that
they
offered
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
as
they
stated
it.
