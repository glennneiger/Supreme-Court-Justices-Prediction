mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
court's
writ
in
this
case
to
the
second
circuit
brings
up
for
review
questions
relating
to
the
scope
and
meaning
of
the
so-called
noerr,
pennington
doctrine,
a
doctrine
which,
as
this
court
knows,
made
clear
that
the
sherman
act
is
not
applicable
to
combinations
of
businessmen
associated
together
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
influence
or
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
legislation
beneficial
to
themselves
in
association
and
unfavorable
to
their
competitors.
that
noerr
doctrine
is
based,
as
your
honors
know,
on
a
construction
of
what
the
sherman
act
read
by
itself
was
meant
to
cover
and
not
to
cover,
and
on
overtones
of
the
first
amendment
affecting
the
right
of
association
and
the
right
to
petition
the
government.
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
with
the
national
electrical
code,
the
nec,
which
i
shall
call
it,
which
i
am
holding
up,
a
700
plus
page
compilation
from
antennas
to
ex-rays...
it
doesn't
have
any
y's
or
z's...
which
is
compiled
every
three
years
by
the
national
fire
protection
association,
a
private
standard-setting
organization.
this
code
is,
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out,
the
most
widely
disseminated
and
most
widely
adopted
standards
code
in
the
world.
it
is
adopted
as
legislation
as
it
appears
in
this
book,
line
by
line,
in
a
majority
of
the
states
of
the
united
states,
and
in
a
majority
of
the
large
municipalities.
it
is
adopted
by
most
of
the
other
states
with
relatively
modest
amendments.
this
controversy
began
when
carlon,
as
it
has
been
called,
a
subsidiary
of
the
respondent,
and
we
have
referred
to
carlon
throughout
the
case
rather
than
indian
head,
carlon
undertook
to
have
a
new
article
331
added
to
this
code
which
would
have
included
as
suitable
equipment
electric
nonmetallic
tubing
made
of
polyvinyl
chloride.
that
tubing
is
a
kind
of
raceway
for
carrying
wires
through
the
walls
and
floors
of
buildings.
and
the
objective
of
carlon
was
to
have
that
product
included
in
this
code
because,
as
we
all
agree,
without
such
inclusion
it
couldn't
sell
it
in
most
of
the
places
throughout
the
united
states
where
that
code
is
law.
there
has
been
evidence
throughout
this
case
that
there
is,
was
at
all
times
that
are
material
scientific
evidence
that
this
tubing
made
of
polyvinyl
chloride
is
unsafe,
that
it
was
hazardous
to
human
life
in
the
event
of
fire,
which
is
what
that
code
is,
of
course,
ultimately
concerned
with.
i
might
mention
that
since
a
footnote
in
our
friend's
brief
suggests
that
that
statement
is
misleading,
i
should
say
that
at
page
4a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
you
will
find
the
circuit
reflecting
the
concurrent
findings
of
both
lower
courts
that
there
was
scientific
evidence
of
the
hazardousness
of
this
product
at
the
material
times
in
this
case.
now,
the
way
you
get
something
into
this
code
is
by
a
multistep
process
that
the
circuit
described.
first,
the
proposed
article
goes
before
a
so-called
code-making
panel.
whatever
happens
there
is
reviewable
at
a
second
step,
a
membership
meeting
of
the
members
of
the
nfpa,
the
fire
protection
association.
if
there
is
a
result
which
the
party
adversely
affected
wishes
to
complain
there
is
an
appeal
to
a
standards
council
and
to
the
board
of
directors,
and
then
if
there
has
been
a
rejection
of
a
proposed
article,
there
is
a
procedure
for
seeking
a
tentative
interim
amendment
which
would
put
the
proposed
article
into
the
code.
now,
this
whole
case
centers
on
the
second
step,
the
membership
vote,
which
took
place
in
this
case
on
may
20,
1980.
the
code-making
panel
had
at
first
rejected
enmt,
their
product,
then
changed
its
decision
and
approved
it
subject
to
the
membership
meeting.
at
that
next
step,
all
members
of
the
nfpa,
and
there
were
at
the
time
31,500
members,
all
members
who
had
held
membership
for
30
days
or
more
are
eligible
to
vote.
now,
the
members
are
explicitly
and
as
everyone
understands
interest
group
representatives.
quoting
from
the
nfpa's
description
of
itself,
interested
members,
and
most
members
are
interested,
as
part
of
the
process
that
the
nfpa
describes
and
extols,
and
i
quote,
"have
the
privilege
of
designating
their
representatives
and
instructing
them
how
to
vote.
"
now,
allied
within
that
rule
as
part
of
the
effort
of
itself
and
other
companies
in
competition
with
this
polyvinyl
product
collected
155
members
for
that
may
20
meeting,
and
those
members
included
executives
of
the
company,
employees,
sales
agents,
and
even
the
wife
of
a
sales
director.
other
steel
companies
also
gathered
whatever
members
they
could,
so
that
among
them
these
alleged
conspirators
had
230
votes
at
that
meeting.
the
final
vote
went
394
to
390
against
carlon.
as
i
have
said,
however,
and
as
the
jury
found,
this
was
by
no
means
the
last
step.
the
jury
said
in
its
finding,
"this
vote
did
not
effectively
determine
that
enmt
would
not
be
in
the
code.
"
it
said
that
vote
was
a
substantial
factor,
but
that
carlon
had,
and
i
am
quoting
another
finding,
"a
full
and
effective
appeal
from
the
vote
of
the
membership
and
that
the
vote
and
allied's,
the
petitioner's
behavior
had
not,
had
not
deprived
carlon
of
full
and
effective
access
to
the
nfpa.
"
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
answers
to
those
interrogatories
will
be
found
at
pages
23,
4,
and
5
of
this
slender
joint
appendix.
carlon
took
its
appeal
to
the
standards
council
and
to
the
board
of
directors,
where
it
was
defeated
on
those
appeals
and
the
record
shows
there
is
plenary
authority
to
consider
whatever
the
appellant
wishes
to
present,
including
even
new
evidence,
and
then
carlon
sought
as
the
last
step
in
this
process
a
tentative
interim
amendment.
it
was
defeated
at
every
stage,
and
the
most
interesting
in
some
respects
was
the
last
stage,
because
in
the
denial
of
the
tentative
interim
amendment,
the
tia,
the
directors
made
clear
that
one
of
the
serious
considerations
leading
to
that
denial
at
that
time
was
their
still
unresolved
doubts
about
safety.
thereafter,
as
the
briefs
show,
and
nobody
disagrees
on
this,
in
1984
carlon's
product
was
allowed
into
the
code
but
with
a
limitation
to
three-story
buildings,
again
reflecting
three
years
later
the
still
lingering
concerns
about
safety
in
the
event
of
fire.
however,
going
back
to
october,
1981,
carlon,
as
a
result
of
that
rejection
of
its
article,
brought
this
lawsuit
against
allied
and
the
nfpa,
later
dropped
the
nfpa,
pursued
the
case
against
carlon.
the
gist
of
the
lawsuit
as
we
think
is
perfectly
clear
is
stated
in
the
language
of
the
complaint
quoted
at
pages
13
and
14
of
the
joint
appendix
that
this
suit
was
brought,
and
i
quote,
"because
of
the
adoption
and
application
of
the
nec
by
states
and
municipalities.
"
and
i
end
the
quote
there,
without
their
article
331
by
all
these
states
and
municipalities,
they
lost
a
tremendous
lot
of
sales,
which
is
not
disputed.
our
client
asserted
the
noerr,
pennington
doctrine
as
a
defense,
and
i
will
try
to
abbreviate.
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
reserved
on
that,
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury.
there
was
a
verdict
for
carlon
including
the
quaint
finding
by
the
jury
that
allied,
our
client,
had
subverted
the
nfpa
process.
after
that
verdict
and
then
a
second
portion
of
the
trial...
i
should
have
said
it
was
a
bifurcated
trial,
liability
first,
then
damages...
there
was
a
verdict
for
$3.8
million,
trebled
plus,
of
course,
attorney's
fees.
the
trial
judge
set
that
verdict
aside,
holding
that
the
noerr,
pennington
defense
was
after
all
a
valid
defense.
on
carlon's
appeal
the
circuit
unanimously
reversed
and
held
that
noerr,
pennington
does
not
apply,
and
that
is
what
brings
us
here.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
time
it
got
to
this
legal
aspect
of
the
case
lost
sight
of
the
facts
it
had
so
carefully
stated
and
utterly,
with
all
deference,
utterly
misconceived
what
noerr,
pennington...
what
the
noerr
decision
itself
was
about,
what
its
facts
were,
and
what
it
held.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
noerr
decision,
which
had
its
27th
anniversary
last
saturday,
related
to
what
the
court,
all
three
courts
describe
as
a
vicious,
corrupt,
and
fraudulent
publicity
campaign
addressed
to
the
general
public
by
a
railroad
association
in
an
effort
to
poison
public
opinion
against
the
trucking
industry
and
thereby
as
the
hoped
for
next
step
to
achieve
legislation
hostile
to
truckers.
the
court
said
that
the
campaign
by
the
railroads
included
conduct
that
justice
black
described
for
a
unanimous
bench
as
reprehensible.
the
so-called
third
party
technique
of
representing
opinions
and
expressions
coming
actually
from
the
railroads
were
the
emanations
of
citizens
and
civic
associations.
the
court
held
nevertheless
that
all
this
was
a
part
of
an
attempt
to
influence
legislation
by
means
of
that
publicity
campaign
and
therefore--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--no,
i
think
strictly,
justice
o'connor,
noerr
rests
on
a
construction
of
the
sherman
strictly,
that
whatever
else
you
might
say
about
that
reprehensible
conduct,
it
was
not
conduct
at
which
the
sherman
act
was
aimed.
it
was
not--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--well,
i
would
say,
to
try
my
best
to
report
justicue
black's
opinion
accurately,
that
after
saying
that
this
is
not
sherman
act
conduct,
he
went
on
to
say
in
that
many
words
that
if
we
were
to
rule
otherwise,
we
would
run
into
serious
concerns
under
the
first
amendment
because
we
would
be
cutting
into
or
we
might
be
cutting
into
the
right
of
association
and
the
right
through
association
to
petition
the
government.
but
i
think
scholars
have
agreed,
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
was
only
two
cases
later
in
the
california
trucking
case
that
this
court
came
down
and
explicitly
said
that
one
leg
of
the
noerr,
pennington
doctrine
is
indeed
the
first
amendment.
i
have
concentrated
on
the
court's
principle
as
i
understand
them
initially
on
the
sherman
act,
because
i
think
noerr
did
concentrate
that
way,
and
what
justice
black
said
is,
whatever
else
you
say
about
this
conduct,
which,
by
the
way,
is
illegal
conduct,
as
the
third
circuit
had
held,
whatever
else
you
say
about
it,
this
isn't
what
the
sherman
act
was
about.
it
is
not
a
case
of
people
giving
up
their
trade
freedom.
it
is
not
a
case
of
price
fixing
or
boycotts
or
market
divisions
or
any
other
kind
of
market
behavior
about
which
senator
sherman
and
his
friends
were
thinking.
it
is
an
attempt
to
influence
public
opinion
with
the
goal
of
getting
legislation,
and
that
is
not
sherman
act
conduct
even
before
you
reach
the
first
amendment,
and
then,
of
course,
the
justice
and
this
court
unanimously
did
reach
the
first
amendment.
now,
in
the
opinion
for
the
second
circuit
of
judge
lumbar,
they
ran
a
series
of
distinctions
of
noerr,
and
again
with
great
respect
it
is
our
submission
that
every
one
of
them
is
clearly
wrong.
they
say,
first,
that
noerr's
holding,
in
the
language
of
the
circuit,
depended
upon
the
unique
nature
of
petitions
directed
to
the
government
in
our
political
system.
well,
that
is
a
mistake.
there
were
no
petitions
directed
to
the
government
at
all
in
the
noerr
case.
the
noerr
case,
as
justice
black
wrote
over
and
over
again,
was
about
this
campaign
of
publicity
addressed
to
the
general
public
with
the
hope
or
anticipation
that
the
public
in
turn
would
have
an
impact
on
the
legislature.
now,
that
was
indirect.
and
judge
lumbard
writes
that
our
conduct
is
somehow
distinguishable
because
it
is
indirect.
well,
we
say
it
is
not
distinguishable
at
all.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
in
that
sense,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
direct,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
a
word
in
the
noerr
opinion
that
describes
directness
in
any
such
sense.
the
opinion
is
about
this
broad
effort,
vicious
and
corrupt,
to
poison
the
public
mind,
and
to
be
sure,
that
includes
members
of
legislatures.
but
then
when
you
speak
of
directness
and
indirectness,
let's
compare
the
cases.
this
book
goes
directly
into
the
statute
books,
and
everybody
knows
that
influencing
the
contents
or
exclusions
from
this
nec
leads
directly,
certainly,
and
predictably
to
legislation,
and
our
friends
knew
that,
and
that
is
why
when
they
sued,
leaving
aside
certain--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
and
similarly,
whatever
public
influence
was
exerted
by
that
vicious
publicity
campaign
in
noerr
only
eventuated
in
the
legislative
conduct
that
the
railroads
sought
when
the
legislators
took
the
action
that
is
for
them
to
take.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
whatever
unreasonably
means,
i
think
it
is
clear
under
noerr
and
under
the
decisions
since
then
that
though
we
would
not
use
such
characterizations,
the
defendants
could
have
acted
viciously
and
reprehensibly
and
perhaps,
though
i
don't
want
to
press
this,
illegally
as
long
as
what
they
were
doing
was
attempting
to
influence
legislation.
the
solicitor
general
says
some
place
that
of
course
the
noerr
doctrine
would
not
cover
kidnapping
legislators.
i
think
that
takes
us
away
from
our
subject,
because
i
don't
think
everybody
has
thought
until
now
that
the
sherman
act
related
to
kidnapping
legislators,
but
where
the
conduct
is
arguably
sherman
act,
and
justice
black
said
this
kind
of
attempt
to
influence
the
legislature
is
not,
the
fact
that
it
turns
out
to
be
such
an
attempt
because
of
what
are
found
in
the
end
to
be
the
real
meanings
of
the
sherman
act
in
the
light
of
the
first
amendment
preclude
sherman
act
liability.
i
might
say
there's
a
seventh
circuit
case
cited
in
our
brief
which
involved
actual
bribery
of
city
council
members.
it's
the
metrocable
case
in
1975.
and
there
again,
going
much
farther
than
we
have
to
go
in
this
case,
the
court
read
noerr
to
apply.
judge
lombard
said
that
there
is
a
distinction
that
is
important
here
between
the
submission
of
a
group's,
and
i
am
quoting,
"of
a
group's
recommendations
to
the
government
and
the
antecedent
conduct
which
generated
those
recommendations.
"
now,
again,
that
is
a
similar,
in
our
view
a
similar
misapprehension
of
what
noerr
was
about.
there
was
no
submission
of
a
group's
recommendations
to
the
legislature
so
far
as
the
noerr
analysis
of
the
problem
was
concerned.
there
was
only
the
antecedent
conduct.
if
anything,
if
you
are
looking
to
the
submission
to
a
legislature,
this
code
as
a
practical
matter
everyone
knows
is
a
submission
to
the
legislature.
now,
in
a
number
of
states,
although
there
is
indeed
the
intervening
official
act
of
the
legislature,
it
is
a
fact,
undisputed
in
this
record,
that
the
adoption
of
this
code
is
automatic,
and
i
suppose
everyone
who
knows
more
about
the--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--yes,
i
said
in
a
number
of
states.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
actually,
in
judge
lombard's
opinion,
i
believe
it
may
be
the
first
footnote,
you
will
find
him
saving
that
this
is
the
most
widely
adopted
code,
and
if
i
just
find
his
first
footnote
rather
than
mine
i
might
be
able
to
read
to
your
honor,
and
he
cites
specifics
from
an
affidavit
on
our
behalf,
that
is,
that
26
states
adopted
verbatim,
19
adopted
with
amendments,
and
if
you
pursue
that
it
appears
that
maybe
ten
or
eleven
of
the
114
articles
in
this
code
tend
to
be
amended,
and
the
municipalities,
which
are
very
important
in
this
regard,
also
widely
adopt
it,
and
it
says
here,
and
i
think
the
survey
was
of
municipalities
of
over
100,000
population,
232
adopted
this
code
exactly
as
written,
256
adopted
it
and
made
changes
on
average
changing
only
eleven
articles,
but
compare--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--your
honor,
the
code
comes
out
every
three
years,
but
i
am
stalling
just
a
bit.
i
have
not
read
one
of
those
statutes
and
seen
exactly
how
they
adopted--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--i
would
in
ignorance
settle
for
its
not
being
automatic
and
for
the
legislators
looking
at
it
every
three
years
and
looking
at
these
700
pages
and
deciding
that
they
can
do
no
better
or
other
than
adopt
this
code
as
it
is
written.
i
want
to
touch
on
one
final
point
of
judge
lombard's.
he
said
you
wouldn't
know
where
to
cut
this
off
if
you
made
this
process
subject
to
noerr,
because
you
wouldn't
know
how
many
legislatures
had
to
adopt
it
before
noerr
applied.
again,
i
want
to
say
of
justice
black's
opinion
that
there
you
have
a
result
that
comprised
only
one
legislative
veto
in
pennsylvania
flowing
as
the
evidence
showed
from
that
reprehensible
publicity
campaign.
if
results
count,
and
we
don't
think
they
do,
because
the
opinion
spoke
of
attempts
to
influence
legislation,
but
if
results
count,
then
this
case
is
more
clearly
within
the
principles
of
noerr
than
the
facts
of
noerr
itself.
i
do
want
to
add--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
in
two
minutes
i
just
be
blunt,
if
the
court
please.
the
answer
mr.
yerman
gave
to
justice
o'connor
questions
about
independent
marketplace
injury
are
incorrect.
the
complaint
rested
on
injury
caused
by
the
enactment
of
this
code
into
statutes.
when
they
were
trying
to
beat
off
a
judgment
nov,
judge
sprizzo
said,
i
think
your
theory
of
damages
all
along
was
that
your
damages
flowed
from
the
fact
that
you
were
not
approved
and
therefore
not
adopted
by
state
legislatures
involved.
as
to
the
proof
of
damages,
the
court
will
find
no
evidence,
no
evidence
allegedly
segregating
so-called
independent
marketplace
injury
from
the
broad
injury
that
their
expert
testified
to
which
all
came
from
not
being
adopted.
if
you
look
at
the
verdict--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
the
nfpa
had
such
a
rule?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
in
the
nfpa?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
weird
rule,
and
i
would
try
very
hard
to
help
mr.
yerman
find
a
theory
that
would
find
it
invalid,
but
it
is
impossible
to
have
an
interest-representing
agency
as
this
one
is,
frankly,
continuing
to
function
and
giving
that
kind
of
dictatorial
power
to
anyone
at
the
interest--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--pardon?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
the
case
is
utterly
different,
your
honor.
i
think
as
the
nfpa
says,
this
is
a
place
where
all
interests
can
come
and
debate.
after
their
vote,
the
higher
ups
in
the
agency
will
review
what
has
happened
with
plenary
authority
to
overturn
it
if
they
think--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--your
honor,
i
don't
argue
that.
i
don't
know
with
the
red
light
on
whether
i
can
tell
the
chief
justice
that
there
was
also--
