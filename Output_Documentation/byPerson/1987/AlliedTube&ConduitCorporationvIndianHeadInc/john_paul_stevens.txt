justice
stevens
judge
frankel,
it
is
true
that
it
goes
directly
into
the
statute
books
but
only
after
the
various
legislatures
decide
to
put
it
in
the
statute
books.
justice
stevens
and
your
position
is,
mr.
frankel,
that
because
of
noerr,
pennington
the
defendants
here
could
act
unreasonably
in
influencing
that
code.
justice
stevens
mr.
frankel,
i
thought
it
was
not
really
undisputed
that
the
adoption
of
the
code
was
automatic.
i
forget
whether
it
is
judge
lombard's
opinion
or
the
respondent's
brief
said
that
it
is
amended
in
places,
and
that
only
half
the
states
adopt
it
verbatim.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
am
sorry.
justice
stevens
mr.
frankel,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
understand
your
argument
about
the
damages.
my
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
noerr
theory?
justice
stevens
would
it
apply
equally
if
in
this
case
they
had
adopted
a
rule
giving
the
steel
conduit
people
a
veto
over
any
change
in
specifications?
justice
stevens
by
reason
of,
say,
lobbying,
the
steel
conduit
people,
instead
of
lobbying
about
this,
got
such
a
rule
adopted.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
is
this
case
really
different
from
that?
justice
stevens
is
this
case
really
different
from
that?
justice
stevens
you
rest
on
the
proposition
this
case
is
different
than
the
hypothetical
one
i
give
you.
you
don't
argue
that
noerr
would
apply
in
my
hypothetical?
