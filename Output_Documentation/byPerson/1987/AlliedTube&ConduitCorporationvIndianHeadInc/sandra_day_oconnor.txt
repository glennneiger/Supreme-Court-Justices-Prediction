justice
o'connor
mr.
frankel,
what
does
the
court's
holding
in
noerr
rest
on?
is
it
the
right
to
petition
the
government?
is
that
the
constitutional
basis
of
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
that
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act
required
because
of
some
constitutional
provision,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
in
a
sense
it
is
direct
insofar
as
members
of
congress
are
also
members
of
the
public.
justice
o'connor
mr.
yerman,
just
by
way
of
clarification,
do
you
concede
that
your
client
is
not
entitled
to
damages
flowing
from
any
governmental
agency's
decision
to
adopt
the
national
electrical
code?
justice
o'connor
just
the
independent
marketplace
injury,
for
example,
in
states
that
didn't
adopt
the
code?
justice
o'connor
and
you
didn't
put
evidence
in
of
damages
in
states
that
adopted
the
code.
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
even
if
they
get
together
and
publish
a
pamphlet?
justice
o'connor
jointly?
justice
o'connor
to
present,
to
express
their
views?
