any
question,
or
is
there
any
issue
here
before
us
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
legal
rules
the
district
court
applied?
justice
white
so
the
issue
is
just
whether
any
jury
could
have
found
under
these
instructions--
justice
white
--what
question
about
the
sherman
act
is
involved
here?
justice
white
all
right,
then
the
question
is,
is
there
enough
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
your
brief,
this
red
brief,
the
second
question
you
listed
is,
if
petitioner's
conspiracy
was
not
immunized
by
the
noerr
doctrine,
was
there
evidence
to
support
the
jury's
determination
that
the
conspiracy
in
question
unreasonably
restrained
trade?
justice
white
now,
that
is...
i
just
asked
you
if
that
is
in
issue.
