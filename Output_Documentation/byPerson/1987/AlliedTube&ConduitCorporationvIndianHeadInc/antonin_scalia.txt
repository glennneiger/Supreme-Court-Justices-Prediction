justice
scalia
mr.
frankel,
could
you
clarify
that?
when
it
says
that
26
adopted
it
through
the
process
of
incorporation
by
reference,
is
that
a
process
which
is
what
you
might
call
year
by
year
incorporation?
does
the
statute
say
that
this
code
as
amended
from
year
to
year
shall
be
the
governing
code,
or
does
the
legislature
each
year
pass
a
separate
statute?
justice
scalia
it
would
be
much
more
impressive,
of
course,
if
it
is
automatic
and
if
you
know
when
you
get
an
amendment
to
this
it
will
automatically
go
into
the
law.
justice
scalia
mr.
yerman,
you
state
as
sort
of
a
given
that
this
would
be
an
anti-trust
violation
absent
the
legislative
involvement
at
the
end
of
it
all.
justice
scalia
is
that
entirely
clear?
what
if
the
jury
here
did
find
in
response
to
the
interrogatories
that
these
defendants
believed
that
there
was
a
safety
problem,
that
that
was
at
least
part
of
their
motivation?
now,
what
if
these
people
had
instead
of
stacking
the
house
simply
done
all
they
could
to
speak
eloquently,
and
shared
information
and
what-not,
and
maybe
took
a
three-month
course
on
public
speaking
in
order
to
get
across
to
the
body
that
this
thing
really
is
dangerous?
now,
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
scalia
i
am
not
asking
about
noerr,
you
understand.
justice
scalia
oh,
no,
but
correct
data.
we
are
talking
correct
data
here.
well,
wait
a
minute.
correct
data.
not
incorrect
data.
justice
scalia
even
though
they
talk
with
one
another,
and
of
course
to
say
that
they
are
not
motivated
by
anti-competitive
considerations
is
absurd.
i
mean,
you
know,
otherwise
they'd
say,
yes,
it
is
unsafe,
but
i
am
not
going
to
make
a
big
deal
about
it.
what
really
gets
them
motivated
to
take
the
rhetoric
courses
and
to
share
the
information
is
the
competitive...
that
would
still
be
all
right.
justice
scalia
so
does
stacking
meetings.
if
it
happened
in
the
congress
you
would
say,
boy,
what
a
legislative
genius,
you
know,
whoever
put
that
together
was,
or
if
it
happened
in
the
iowa
caucuses
you
would
say
somebody
was
really
thinking,
that
is
very
clever
democratic
politicking.
now,
this
was
in
the
rules
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
how
does
that
constitute
an
anti-trust
violation?
i
mean,
maybe
we
can
put
them
in
jail
if
there
is
some
statute
that
says
you
shall
not
subvert
the
rules
of
private
organizations,
but
we
are
talking
here
about
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
now,
the
effect
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
no
matter
how
it
is
achieved.
the
motivation,
safety
or
no
safety,
is
either
reasonable
or
unreasonable
no
matter
what
techniques
are
used.
how
does
the
fact
that
they
violate,
you
know,
the
rules
of
the
marquis
of
salisbury
or
whoever
makes
rules
for
not
packing
organization,
how
does
that
make
this
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
you
are
stacking
it
by
saying
that
it
wasn't
based
on
the
merits.
the
jury
found
that
they
truly
believed
it
was
unsafe.
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
it
was
based
on
the
merits.
some
of
the
subsequent
history
seems
to
indicate
that
it
may
have
been
based
on
the
merits.
the
only
thing
you
are
complaining
about
is
using
rules
which
didn't
really
violate
any
of
the
principles
of
the
association
but
which
you
think
are
unfair.
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
i
am
stacking
it
because,
as
justice
stevens
held
in
professional
engineers,
and
especially
in
a
standard-making
context,
your
own
view
of
the
safety
of
the
product,
your
reason
for
violating
the
anti-trust
laws
because
you
think
it
is
unsafe
is
irrelevant.
as
justice
stevens
described
it,
that
type
of
philosophy
would
be
a
frontal
assault
on
the
sherman
act,
and
that
is
totally
rejected,
whether
they
thought
it
was
safe
or
unsafe
does
not
license
them
to
subvert
the
standard
and
come
up
with
a
non-meritorious
standard.
when
i
say
meritorious,
justice
scalia,
what
i
mean,
and
let
me
be
clear
on
this,
is
the
consensus
that
otherwise
would
have
been
reached
in
that
private
standard-making
body
but
for
the
corruption.
in
any
private
standard-making
debate
one
side
is
going
to
be
right--
--what
is
your
definition
of
corruption,
though?
justice
scalia
i
think
it
was
put
more
felicitously
in
the
petition.
the
second
question
was
whether,
even
without
regard
to
the
noerr
doctrine
such
lobbying
and
voting
tactics
otherwise
lawful
and
in
compliance
with
the
rules
of
a
code-making
association
are
proscribed
by
the
sherman
act
if
a
jury
finds
they
"subvert
the
rules".
you
would
agree
with
that?
justice
scalia
mr.
yerman,
just
let
me
ask
before
we
get
off--
justice
scalia
--suppose
they
hadn't
gotten
new
members
within
the
30...
you
know,
before
the
30-day
deadline,
but
had
simply
called
up
all
of
the
people,
all
of
their
steel-making
conduit
buddies
and
said
it
is
an
important
vote,
we
think
this
stuff
is
unsafe,
but
more
important,
it
is
really
going
to
hurt
our
business.
make
sure
that
all
of
your
people
who
are
members
get
out
for
this
meeting.
would
that
have
been
a
subversion?
justice
scalia
but
you
see,
that
is
my
difficulty.
i
am
concerned
about
these
organizations.
i
think
they
fulfill
an
important
role,
and
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
adopt
a
rule
that
makes
the
people
that
participate
in
them
know
what
constitutes
a
treble
damage
liability
or
not.
justice
scalia
not
quite.
you
still
have
to
have
a
jury
finding
that
these
people
were
motivated,
at
least
in
part,
although
that
may
not
have
been
worth
the
plane
fare,
at
least
in
part
by
the
fact
they
really
believed
this
stuff
was
unsafe.
and
that
doesn't
create
such
a
terrible
system.
you
say,
you
know,
we
are
harnessing
the
power
of
greed
to
make
sure
that
unsafe
products
don't
get
onto
the
marketplace.
of
course
the
competitors
will
be
the
one
who
are
interested
about
it,
but
that
achieves
some
social
good,
you
might
say.
