mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
begin
by
turning
directly
to
noerr.
as
we
have
all
heard,
justice
black
focused
in
that
case
on
what
he
described
as
the
right
of
the
people
to
inform
their
representatives
in
government
of
their
desires
with
respect
to
the
passage
or
enforcement
of
law.
with
that
in
mind,
the
court
held
that
the
railroad
publicity
campaign
in
that
case,
despite
being
deceiptful
and
underhanded,
did
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws
because,
in
the
words
of
noerr,
a
publicity
campaign
to
influence
governmental
action
falls
clearly
within
the
category
of
political
activity
to
which
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply.
congress,
the
court
concluded,
had
not
intended
the
sherman
act
for
application
in
the
political
arena,
and
those
are
the
key
words,
"the
political
arena",
because
none
of
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
conspiracy
hatched
by
allied
within
the
confines
of
the
national
fire
protection
assoication,
a
totally
private
body,
a
private
standard-making
group
accountable
to
no
one,
and
in
the
words
of
this
court
a
group
rife
with
opportunities
for
anticompetitive
behavior.
what
happened
here
was
nothing
like
what
happened
in
noerr.
there
the
railroad's
publicity
campaign
was
aimed
at
getting
at
legislation
to
injure
the
truckers,
and
it
was
obviously
a
public
campaign
in
the
political
arena
aimed
at
the
body
politic.
and
if
all
allied
and
its
cohorts
had
done
in
this
case
was
to
engage
in
a
publicity
campaign
against
carlon
and
its
product,
none
of
us
would
be
here
today.
but
allied
did
much
more
than
that.
first,
they
conspired
with
their
competitors
to
exclude
carlon's
product
from
the
national
electrical
code,
a
private
industry
code
that
is
a
conceded
fact,
that
conspiracy
to
exclude.
and
as
the
court
below
found,
that
conspiracy
caused
independent
marketplace
injury
to
carlon
wholly
independent
of
any
injury
caused
by
being
excluded
by
law.
in
other
words,
in
all
of
those
jurisdictions
where
carlon
could
otherwise
have
sold
its
product
notwithstanding
any
state
action,
carlon
suffered
independent
marketplace
injury.
the
record
is
abundantly
clear
that
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
that
that
was
what
the
evidence
was
limited
to,
and
if
we
want,
a
little
bit
later
i
will
get
to
that
specific
evidence.
now,
allied
argues
that
what
it
did
so
long
as
its
actions
were
ultimately
in
pursuit
of
legislation
is
somehow
sheltered
by
noerr.
in
effect,
allied
seeks
to
duck
under
the
noerr
umbrella
by
claiming
that
its
conduct,
an
anti-trust
violation
committed
within
the
national
fire
protection
association
which
standing
alone
caused
injury
to
carlon
was
ultimately
aimed
at
getting
some
states
to
enact
this
code.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
am,
justice
o'connor.
allied--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--that
is
all
we
are
talking
about,
exactly.
that
is
where
we
were
injured.
that
is
what
the
trial
court
limited
our
damage
claim
to,
and
that
is
the
injury
we
were
awarded
by
the--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--right.
correct.
allied's
argument
cannot
hold
water
because
violations
of
the
anti-trust
laws
cannot
fall
by
the
wayside
merely
because
conspirators
claim
that
their
violations
were
in
pursuit
of
legislation.
even
if
that
claim
were
true,
for
example,
the
conspirators
in
the
fashion
originators
case
would
not
have
been
exonerated
if
they
had
proven
that
they
engaged
in
their
group
boycott
in
order
to
spur
legislation
banning
the
sale
of
pirated
dress
designs.
such
a
violation
stands
alone,
was
a
violation,
and
that
was
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws,
notwithstanding
that
maybe
they
did
it
in
order
to
inspire
congress
to
pass
the
law.
there
have
been
district
court
cases
in
the
same
area,
as
your
honors
may
recall,
the
pennylvania
service
station
dealers
who
all
boycotted
the
sale
of
gasoline
for
a
period
of
time
in
order
to
spur
the
government
to
increase
price
support.
that
was
rejected.
not
every
antecedent,
anti-trust
violation
on
the
weight
of
the
legislature
is
sheltered
ny
noerr,
and
it
never
has
been.
put
simply,
a
private
restraint
does
not
come
under
noerr
merely
because
there
is
some
hope
or
expectation
of
governmental
endorsement,
not
as
here
in
particular
where
we
have
an
antecedent,
completed
anti-trust
violation.
conspiracy,
injury,
damage
all
caused
outside
the
political
arena
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
action,
but
because
we
were
excluded
from
a
private
industry
code.
allied
may
have
hoped
that
by
excluding
us
from
the
nec
it
might
in
fact
bar
us
from
states
that
would
adopt
that
into
law,
but
that
doesn't
excuse
them
from
the
damage
we
suffered
in
all
those
other
places
where
the
law
was
never
passed,
and
we
are
talking,
incidentally,
about
roughly
half
the
country.
it
is
really
kind
of
ironic
when
you
think
about
it.
in
hydrolevel
there
was
a
misinterpretation
of
a
code.
not
a
word
was
mentioned
of
noerr.
in
hydrolevel
the
code,
according
to
this
court,
was
adopted
in
whole
by
46
states.
in
fact,
this
court
made
a
point
of
saying
the
thing
that
made
that
anti-trust
violation
in
hydrolevel
so
terrible,
so
pernicious
was
because
of
the
governmental
adoption,
the
importance
and
influence
of
the
code.
what
this
all
comes
down
to
is
that
the
hold
that
noerr
applies
here
would
be
to
conclude
that
the
congress
that
enacted
the
sherman
act,
because
i
agree
with
mr.
frankel
that
in
fact
noerr
itself...
justice
black
was
initially
grounding
it
on
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act,
would
be
to
conclude
that
when
senator
sherman
introduced
the
sherman
act
he
intended
to
insulate
from
all
anti-trust
scrutiny
all
concerted
activity
in
a
private
standard-making
context
in
effect
to
license
the
blatant
anticompetitive
conspiracy
found
in
this
case,
and
i
submit
that
that
simply
defies
logic
and
reason,
especially
in
light
of
the
legion
of
anti-trust
cases
which
have
held
over
the
years
that
private
standard-making
conspiracies
are
in
fact
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason
at
least.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
yes.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
justice
scalia,
i
am
really
glad
to
asked
that
question,
because
i
think
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
why
noerr
doesn't
apply
here.
let's
think
about
this.
why
are
we
talking
about
noerr?
we
are
talking
about
noerr
apart
from
statutory
interpretation
because
of
the
first
amendment
implications
of
noerr,
the
right
to
petition,
the
right
to
assemble,
the
right
to
speak,
to
debate,
to
persuade,
to
disseminate
information.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
well,
i
do
understand,
and
i
think
in
this
respect
both
the
rule
of
reason
and
noerr
in
a
way
come
together,
because
i
think
i
can
answer
your
question
two
ways.
in
a
private
standard-making
organization...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
there
would
be
no
problem.
let
me
do
that
first.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
they
can
say
anything
they
want.
yes,
they
can
speak
in
a
private
standard-making
context.
they
can
speak
and
give
their
views,
and
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
even
if
they
were
wrong,
even
if
they
made
a
mistake--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--i
think
at
that
point
i
would
have
a
problem.
now,
i
mean,
i
don't
have
that
case
here.
i
think
in
a
private
standard-making
context
which
is
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason,
the
intentional
submission
of
incorrect
data
in
a
conspiratorial
context
to
exclude
a
product
from
the
marketplace
i
think
is
something
a
jury,
a
finder
of
fact,
would
weigh
heavily--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--then
i
have
no
problem
at
all.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
absolutely.
i
mean,
that
is
the
essence
of
private
standard-making.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
yes.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
yes.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
goes
on
every
day
in
private
standard-making,
and
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
that's
the
root
of
the
issue.
okay.
first
of
all,
within
the
rules,
allied
conceded
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
what
we
had
here
was
a
potential
for
abuse.
that
is
how
they
described
the
rule
situation
of
the
nfpa.
the
nfpa
had
rules
that
allowed
someone,
unfortunately
in
this
case,
to
circumvent
their
procedures
and
to
subvert
the
consensus
standard-making
process
in
order
to
come
up
with
a
consensus
on
this
issue
that
was
different
from
the
consensus
that
otherwise
would
have
been
achieved
if
they
had
followed
the
nfpa
procedures.
i
would
urge
you
to
review
the
briefs
and
the
record
on
this,
because
that
was
the
specific
jury
finding.
they
talk
a
lot
in
their
brief
about
this
subversion
thing
being
somewhat
ambiguous,
or
vague,
or
what
does
it
mean?
well,
a,
let's
remember
a
couple
of
things.
first,
they
never
objected
to
the
question
being
put
to
the
jury.
b,
they
never
objected
to
the
instruction
to
the
jury
on
what
it
was
all
about.
and
c,
what
was
it
all
about?
what
it
was
all
about
was,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
to
a
fare-thee-well
on
this
and
they
put
in
evidence
to
a
fare-thee-well
on
this
that
the
nfpa
operates
under
certain
standards
and
procedures.
sure
it
has
some
rules,
but
there
was
a
loophole
and
they
drove
a
truck
through
the
loophole
and
thereby
subverted
the
procedures
and
produced
a
result
that
otherwise
would
not
have
been
producible.
now,
they
came
in
and
they
argued,
just
like
they
are
talking
here,
this
was
everyday
stuff,
it
goes
on
all
the
time,
there
was
a
history
of
this
at
the
npfa
and
nobody
considered
it
wrong,
nobody
thought
there
was
anything
improper
about
it.
they
argued
all
of
that
to
the
jury,
and
the
judge
told
the
jury
to
consider
all
that,
in
a
rule
of
reason
context
consider
whether
this
was
all
correct
or
proper,
and
the
jury
rejected
it
out
of
hand.
they
said
absolutely
not.
this
was
a
subversion
of
the
process.
now,
i
will
agree
there
were--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--the
jury
was
instructed
on
this
as
well,
and
it
is
the
same
way
you
do
any
rule
of
reason
analysis.
let
me
begin,
first
of
all,
by
pointing
out
that
in
the
hydrolevel
case
there
was
a
misinterpretation
of
the
standard.
it
was
not,
as
mr.
frankel
points
out,
price
fixing.
it
wasn't
a
classic
group
boycott
like
in
fashion
originators.
this
court
in
hydrolevel
had
no
problem
understanding
and
holding
that
when
a
couple
of
competitors
fool
around
with
the
code
and
put
out
some
phony
interpretation,
that
that
was
clearly
a
conspiracy
to
exclude
the
competitor's
product
by
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
sell
it,
and
that
is
what
they
did
in
hydrolevel,
and
that
was
a
violation,
but
let
me
answer
your
question
on
the
rule
of
reason,
judge
scalia,
if
you
would
like
me
to,
please.
what
happened
here
was,
there
was
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
you
start
out
with
the
fundamentals
of
private
standard-making.
private
standard-making,
with
all
due
respect,
are
walking
conspiracies.
they
are
a
bunch
of
competitors
who
sit
around
deciding
which
of
their
competitor's
products
will
be
allowed
in
and
which
are
going
to
be
excluded.
the
law
over
the
years
has
evolved
under
the
rule
of
reason
to
permit
private
standard-making
because
the
dissemination
of
information,
in
a
nutshell,
the
dissemination
of
information,
the
promulgation
of
meritorious
standards
is
thought
to
be
pro-competitive,
and
it
is
that
pro-competitive
benefit
that
outweighs
the
anti-competitive
side
of
having
some
products
excluded.
this
is
all
rather
run
of
the
mill.
now,
what
happened
here?
what
happened
here
was,
a
bunch
of
competitors
get
together
and
conspire
to
subvert
this
meritorious
standard-making
process
to
come
up
with
a
standard
in
effect,
with
an
exclusion
that
wasn't
based
on
the
merits,
to
use
this
as
a
way
to
block
someone's
product.
all
right?
just
like
the
conspirators
in
hydrolevel
got
together
to
misinterpret
the
code
to
exclude
their
competitor's
product.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
in
this
case,
corruption
in
this
case
was
in
effect
the
dilution
of
the
votes,
of
all--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--there
was
no
specific
rule
that
said
that.
that
is
correct.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
hold
the
private
standard-making
process
and
the
rule
of
reason
analysis
of
whether
private
standard-making
is
lawful
or
not
up
to
a
standard
where
the
organization
promulgates
rules,
and
if
their
rule
isn't
violated,
everything
they
do
is
okay.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
in
this
case,
in
effect,
yes.
that's
right.
i
mean,
it's
a
tough
case
to
prove.
i
think
you
have
a--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--the
charge
was
never
objected
to.
the
rule
of
reason
charge
came
in
without
objection.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
that
is
not
an
issue
either,
justice
white.
that
has
not
been
questioned.
the
jury
verdicts
have
not
been
questioned
in
terms
of
sufficiency.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
i
think
that
they
argue
that
there
is
no
rule
of
reason
violation
here
based
upon
the
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
well,
i
mean,
i
really
don't
think
that's
the
question,
because
i
think
that
the
jury
sufficiency
issue
is
already
resolved.
i
think
perhaps
you
could
look
at
all
this,
i
suppose,
take
the
whole
case,
and
say,
we
think
that
on
this
record
this
is
not
a
rule
of
reason
violation.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
i
think--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--fair
enough.
that
is
fair
enough.
and
i
am
not
trying
to
walk
away
from
that.
all
i
am
saying
is,
i
don't
think
there's
an
issue
of
evidentiary
sufficiency
here,
and
i
think
perhaps
you
are
right,
that
could
have
been
put
more
felicitously.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
fair
enough.
and
i
apologize
for
the
ambiguity,
justice
white,
but
i
really
think
that
is
what
the
issue
is.
on
the
issue
of
the
inconsistency
of
the
verdicts
in
talking
about
no
violation
of
rules
and
so
forth,
the
jury
and
the
trial
court
had
no
problem
understanding
based
upon
the
evidence
here
why
even
though
there
were
these
rules
under
all
of
the
evidence
put
in
concerning
how
the
nfpa
operated,
what
the
nfpa's
overall
policies,
standards,
and
what
everybody
in
that
organization
understood
its
objectives
and
standards
to
be,
that
this
was
in
fact
a
corruption
of
the
process,
that
this
was
in
fact
the
achievement
of
a
consensus
other
than
the
consensus
that
would
have
been
achieved.
when
the
plaintiff
argued
below
that
the
verdicts
were
inconsistent,
something
not
before
you
today,
the
judge
held
that
it
is
not
inconsistent,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
finding
of
subversion
even
though
there
was
a
finding
that
the
rules
weren't
violated
or
there
wasn't
effective
appeal.
he
said,
that
is
not
consistent.
you
know
it.
you
argued
to
the
jury
there
was
no
violation
of
the
rules
and
the
jury
found
that,
but
i
told
the
jury
they
were
entitled
to
consider
on
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
whether
or
not
even
though
you
technically
complied
with
the
rules
whether
you
subverted
the
spirit
of
the
rules
as
well
as
their
letter,
so
that
finding
is
totally
not
consistent.
indeed,
that
is
precisely
the
answer
we
contemplated
when
we
put
it
to
the
jury,
and
he
goes
on
that
way,
to
point
out
that
he
found
there
was
nothing
inconsistent,
and
i
would
point
out,
of
course,
that
at
this
level
it
is
hardly
the
time
to
start
looking
into
inconsistencies,
especially
where
the
rule
is
very
clear
that
if
the
verdicts
can
be
read
in
any
way
to
be
consistent,
then
the
verdict
is
to
be
sustained,
and
i
think
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
have
reviewed
that
issue,
and
both
have
found
the
jury's
verdicts
were
consistent.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
oh,
absolutely.
it
is
all
over
the
place.
that
is
what
this
organization
is
all
about,
is
consensus.
now,
let
me
just
say
one--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--yes.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
well,
you
know,
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
answer
that,
because
the
issue
of
that
wasn't
necessarily
raised.
my
tendency
would
be
to
think
probably
not,
unless--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--and
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
mean
to
not
try
to
answer
your
question.
let
me
just
say
that
i
think
it
is
a
tough
case,
and
i
started
to
say
that
before.
it
will
be
a
very
tough
case
to
persuade
a
jury
that
in
the
context
of
all
of
the
proceedings
that
go
on,
in
the
context
of
the
history
of
the
organization
and
so
forth,
that
someone
corrupted
the
process
by
producing
a
consensus
that
otherwise
wouldn't
have
been
achieved.
i
think
that
is
going
to
be
a
very
hard
thing
to
get
a
jury
verdict
on.
it
wasn't
easy
for
us.
what
made
it
easy
here
in
this
case
was
because
the
action
was
so
far
away
from
anything
that
this
organization
had
ever
seen
or
done,
was
so
far
outside
what
we
consider
to
be
acceptable
behavior
in
this
organization
under
their
procedures
that
it
was
clearly
a
violation.
if
you
can--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
you
tell
that
by
submitting
to
the
jury,
as
allied
did,
a
history
of
what
went
on
in
that
organization,
of
what
kinds
of
things
were
being
done,
of
what
people
understood
was
permissible
and
what
people
understood
was
not
permissible.
by
putting
in--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--well,
i
know
there
was
no
rule
that
said--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
just
a
minute.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
yes.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
it
was
based...
it
was
not
based
on
a
specific
rule,
as
i
say.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
yes,
it
was
based
upon
a
standard
that
everyone
understood
in
that
organization,
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
achieve
a
result
on
a
vote
in
that
organization
by
dominating
the
meeting
with
a
commercial
interest.
that
is
what
everyone
understood.
they
were
not
supposed
to
take
a
standard
which
is
up
for
review
by
that
organization
and
bring
in
as
many
people
as
are
allied
to
you,
pay
their
expenses
to
boston
for
the
meeting,
220
votes,
so
that
you
can
achieve
a
consensus
that
is
different
from
what
otherwise
would
have
been
achieved
on
the
merits.
you
can
lobby.
you
can
speak.
you
can
talk
to
all
the
people
who
would
otherwise
be
coming.
you
can
try
to
make
sure
there
is
an
important
discussion
of
this.
but
you
shouldn't
change
what
the
vote
otherwise
would
have
been.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
you
know
it
when
you
bring
in
220
people,
you
pay
their
expenses,
they
are
know-nothing
voters,
they
don't
know
what
they
are
voting
on,
they
are
not
participating
in
the
debate,
they
have
nothing
to
say
about
anything
other
than
they
were
trucked
up
to
boston
to
vote
no
on
the
product.
nothing
like
that
has
ever
happened
before,
and
everyone
in
the
meeting--
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
--not
for
220
people.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
there
were
300...
the
vote
turned
out
to
be
394
to
390.
okay?
if
they
had
brought
ten
people
and
if
they
could
have
shown
that
over
the
years
they
normally
brought
five,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
a
lawsuit.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
well,
let
me
turn
it
around
for
just
a
second,
justice
rehnquist,
because
i
don't
suggest
that
this
is
that
easy
a
question,
but
let's
think
about
the
alternative
for
a
second.
you
have
a
private
standard-making
association.
put
noerr
aside
for
a
minute.
you
have
a
private
standard-making
association
that
has
the
power
to
exclude
the
product
from
the
marketplace.
are
we
saying
that
under
the
anti-trust
laws
the
question
of
whether
a
new
and
innovative
product
gets
into
the
code,
gets
into
the
marketplace
is
strictly
a
matter
of
which
company
has
enough
money
to
bring
enough
people
to
private
standard-making
meetings
to
block
it
or
not
block
it?
i
mean,
is
that
what
the
result
is,
because
that
is
the
result
you
are
left
with
unless
you
are
prepared
to
deal
with
this
question,
and
simply
to
say,
well,
the
organization
didn't
have
a
rule
against
it
leaves
us
at
sea.
mr.
fredric
w.
yerman
the
answer
to
that,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
point
made
in
professional
engineers
about
safety
was
that
people
can't
dictate
what
goes
on
the
market
or
not
because
they
think
it
is
safe
or
not
safe.
you
take
this
product.
mr.
frankel
made
a
whole
point
about
how
it
was
excluded
in
'80,
it
came
in
in
'83
with
a
three-story
limit.
in
'87
the
three-story
limit
was
dropped.
the
product
is
not
unsafe.
there
was
a
debate
about
it.
there
are
debates
about
a
lot
of
products.
just
because
you
can
marshall
enough
evidence
to
say
i
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
product,
what
product
is
there
out
there
that
you
could
not
legitimately
prove,
i
genuinely
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
it,
and
then
i
come
into
this
private
standard-making
association
with
that
finding,
justice
scalia,
and
please
do
not
put
aside
the
fact
there
was
a
concession
in
the
case
that
they
had
an
anticompetitive
motive,
they
conceded
that
they
wanted
to
exclude
the
product
for
commercial
reasons
as
well,
so
all
they
have
to
do
is
find
one
little
piece
of
information,
one
scientist
who
says,
i
think
there
is
a
problem
with
this,
and
you
are
home
free.
bring
all
the
votes
you
can.
truck
them
up
to
boston,
and
you
are
out
of
the
code,
and
forget
the
sherman
act.
i
just
don't
think
you
can
be
left
with
that
kind
of
result.
i
agree,
it
is
not
that
easy
a
line
to
draw
when
the
consensus
standard-making
process
and
private
standard-making
is
subverted,
but
i
think
a
line
has
to
be
drawn,
and
i
think
it
was
easily
drawn
here.
one
last
thing
if
i
can
just
get
this
out
on
noerr,
and
i
don't
want
to
forget
this.
noerr
was
brought
to
preserve
speech,
debate,
persuasion,
as
i
said
before.
wouldn't
it
be
the
supreme
irony
if
in
the
name
of
preserving
the
right
to
debate
and
give
information
you
allow
a
procedure
that
says,
and
when
all
is
said
and
done,
all
the
debate
is
out
the
window,
all
the
information
that
was
disseminated,
you
can
forget
about
because
we
are
bringing
in
220
know-nothings
who
don't
care
what
the
information
is,
they
are
voting
no.
don't
i
have
noerr
rights,
too?
don't
i
have
a
right
to
know
that
when
i
make
an
argument,
when
i
make
a
debate,
when
i
give
information,
that
when
the
vote
comes
in
people
are
going
to
vote
on
the
merits
and
the
vote
will
reflect
the
information.
in
this
case,
my
noerr
rights
disappear
because
everything
i
said
didn't
matter.
there
were
220
people
that
came
in
and
outvoted
me
not
because
of
any
information
or
anything
else.
one
last
word.
if
for
any
reason,
and
i
of
course
respectfully
argue
that
it
ought
not
to
be,
you
were
inclined
to
apply
noerr
in
this
situation,
then
i
would
urge
you
to
look
closely
at
the
sham
ruling
in
the
sessions
decision,
which
is
also
before
you
on
a
cert
petition
now
in
the
ninth
circuit
on
similar
facts,
although
different.
sessions,
all
the
people
that
were
voters
were
government
officials,
and
there
was
no
injury
other
than
injury
from
the
state,
and
both
of
those
are
very
important
distinctions
from
us
in
sessions.
i
am
not
rearguing
sessions,
but
what
the
sessions
court
said
was,
we
think,
and
they
analyzed
this
out
to
say
noerr
should
apply,
but
they
said,
nevertheless,
looking
at
the
second
circuit,
we
disagree
with
their
noerr
reasoning,
but
clearly
what
happened
in
the
second
circuit
would
be
a
sham.
and
i
would
say
to
you,
this,
too,
should
be
a
sham
even
if
noerr
applies.
what
greater
sham
is
there
than
after
you
have
had
all
the
noerr
protected
speech,
to
in
effect
block
us,
take
us
out
of
the
whole
tribunal,
take
us
out
of
this
legislature,
bring
in
220
new
legislators,
and
let
them
vote
us
down?
if
you
are
going
to
analogize
this
situation
to
a
legislative
situation,
the
nfpa
is
somehow
thought
of
like
a
legislature.
you
can
say
anything,
you
can
give
information,
you
can
give
wrong
information.
maybe
even
you
can
lie,
but
what
you
can't
do
when
all
is
said
and
done
when
that
is
finished
is
truck
in
220
new
legislators
who
are
on
your
payroll
and
get
them
to
vote
it
down.
where
does
that
leave
the
noerr
protected
speech?
what
is
the
sense
of
having
noerr
if
the
speech
doesn't
matter?
are
there
any
other
questions?
okay.
thank
you
very
much.
