the
other
case,
allied
tube
&
conduit
versus
indian
head,
that
case
involves
a
private
association,
the
national
fire
protection
association,
which
publishes
product
standards
and
codes
related
to
fire
protection.
its
national
electrical
code,
which
establishes
requirements
for
the
design
and
installation
of
electrical
wiring
systems,
is
routinely
adopted
into
law
by
a
substantial
number
of
state
and
local
governments.
throughout
the
relevant
period,
the
code
permitted
however,
the
use
of
only
electrical
conduits
made
of
steel.
respondent
is
a
manufacturer
of
plastic
conduit
and
then
initiated
a
proposal
before
the
association
to
extend
code
approval
to
plastic
conduit
as
well
as
steel
conduit.
the
proposal
was
approved
by
one
of
the
association's
professional
panels,
and
thus
could
be
adopted
into
the
code
by
a
simple
majority
of
the
members
attending
the
association's
1980
annual
meeting.
before
the
meeting
was
held
however,
petitioner,
which
is
the
nation's
largest
producer
of
steel
conduit
joined
by
members
of
the
steel
industry,
other
steel
conduit
manufacturers,
and
independent
sales
agents
collectively
agreed
to
exclude
respondent's
plastic
product
from
the
1981
code.
it
did
so
by
packing
the
annual
meeting
with
new
association
members,
made
members
only
for
the
purpose
and
for
the
--
who
was
to
discharge
the
simple
function
of
voting
against
respondent's
proposal.
after
the
proposal
was
defeated
at
the
meeting
and
an
appeal
to
the
association's
board
of
directors
was
denied,
respondent
brought
this
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
petitioner
and
the
others
had
unreasonably
restrained
trade
in
the
electrical
conduit
market
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
jury
found
petitioner
liable,
but
the
court
granted
a
judgment
n.o.v.
for
the
petitioner,
reasoning
that
it
was
entitled
to
antitrust
immunity
under
the
doctrine
of
eastern
railroad
presidents
conference
versus
noerr
motor
freight,
the
decision
of
ours
for
some
years
ago.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
we
affirmed
the
reversal.
we
hold
that
noerr
antitrust
immunity
does
not
apply
to
the
petitioner.
the
scope
of
noerr
protection
depends
on
the
source,
context,
and
nature
of
the
anticompetitive
restraint
an
issue.
in
this
case,
the
operative
restraint
is
a
product's
standard
set
by
a
private
association
without
official
authority
that
includes
members
having
horizontal
and
vertical
business
relations
and
economic
incentives
to
restrain
competition.
based
on
a
careful
examination
of
the
nature
and
context
of
this
restraint,
we
conclude
that
even
though
the
product
standard
is
routinely
adopted
by
legislatures,
petitioner's
efforts
to
exclude
respondent's
product
from
that
standard
enjoy
no
nor
immunity
from
any
antitrust
liability
flowing
from
the
effect
the
standard
has
of
its
own
force
in
the
market
place.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor
has
joined.
