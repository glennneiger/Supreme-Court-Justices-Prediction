chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-157,
allied
tube
and
conduit
corporation
versus
indian
head,
inc.--
mr.
frankel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
frankel,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
interrogatories?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
they
were
evilly
motivated,
that
they
gave
their
views
but
their
intent
was
to
suppress
competition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
rule
against
dilution
of
votes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
it
just
a
question
then
the
jury
decides
on
all
the
evidence
whether
something
was
"corrupt"
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
can
you
tell
that
it
was
so
far
outside
of
what
was
considered
acceptable
behavior?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
though
not
based
on
any
rule
of
the
organization?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
asked
you
a
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
it
or
was
it
not
based
on
any
rule
of
the
organization?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
it
based
on
an
unspecific
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
whether
you
are
changing
what
the
vote
would
otherwise
have
been?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no
expenses
had
ever
been
paid
before,
of
anyone
had
ever
been
paid
before?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
cutoff?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
every
one
of
these
questions
then
goes
to
the
jury,
because
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
summary
judgment
for
a
defense
because
it
is
always
a
question
of
degree
that
has
to
be
answered
by
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
yerman.
mr.
frankel,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you
should,
mr.
frankel.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
