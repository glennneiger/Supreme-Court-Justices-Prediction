mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
appeal
of
the
decision
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
a
procedural
rule
requiring
appellate
counsel
to
inform
the
court
why
issues
in
an
appeal
lack
merit
when
counsel
reaches
that
conclusion.
we
contend
in
this
case
that
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
in
error
and
that
the
effect
of
the
appellee's
argument
and
the
decision
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
to
ask
this
court
to
redefine
either
the
role
of
counsel
in
an
appeal
or
the
nature
of
an
appeal
or
both.
now,--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
in
this
particular
case,
the
problem
with
that
result
is
that,
as
appellee
concedes
in
their
brief,
it
removes
an
appeal
from
the
adversarial
testing
process
once
counsel
reaches
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
in
so
doing,
since
wisconsin
has
provided
by
its
constitution
that
a
client
is
entitled
to
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
he
is
getting
something
less
than
that
in
the
wisconsin
judicial
system.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
we
are
not
contending
that
the
indigent
defendant
is
entitled
to
everything.
for
example,
i
think
you
are
correct
that
a
client
who
has
a
great
deal
of
money
can
shop
around.
i
think
that
was
recognized
in
the
united
states
v.
edwards,
7th
circuit
case.
you
can
shop
around
and
look
for
someone
to
make
that
argument.
at
the
same
time,
this
court
has
held
consistently
that,
in
fact,
in
discussing
the
due
process
rule,
they've
also
discussed
it
in
the
context
of
equal
protection,
and
they
say
essentially
the
purpose
of
anders
is
to
try
to
provide
a
criminal
defendant
with
the
same
type
of
representation
he
would
receive
if
he
were
having
a
retained
counsel.
so,
the
court
has
made
that
recognition
in
the
past.
basically,
in
this
situation,
appellee
concedes
that
the
purpose
of
this
rule
is
to
take
the
appeal
out
of
the
adversarial
testing
process.
now,
since
the
court
has
previously
described
in
polk
county
v.
dodson
and
evitts
v.
lucey
that
an
appeal
is
just
that,
it's
the
adversarial
testing
process,
and
that
a
client
is
deprived
of
due
process
when
he
has
less
than
that.
in
effect,
what
they
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is,
in
a
context
of
a
no
merit
appeal,
take
the
appeal
out
of
the
adversarial
process,
redefine
the
nature
of
appeal,
and
give
the
client
something
less
than
that
which
he
is
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
right
in
wisconsin.
now,
in
addition--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--the
one
thing
that
anders
did...
i
do
not.
i
think
the
one
thing
that
anders
did--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--right.
i
think
the
one
thing
that
anders
did
is
to
try--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--no.
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
no.
i
can't
imagine
a
client
paying
a
lawyer
to
go
in
and
argue
the
case
as
totally
frivolous.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
in
effect,
the
poor
defendant...
for
example,
in
anders,
anders
tried
to
resolve
a
difficult
ethical
dilemma
that
counsel
faces.
when,
on
the
one
hand,
you
are
obligated
to
litigate
the
appeal
on
the
client's
behalf
to
the
best
of
one's
ability,
but,
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
reached
the
decision
that
the
case
is
wholly
frivolous
and
without
arguable
merit.
now,
the
client
is
entitled
to
have
the
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
and
he's
entitled
to
a
vigorous
advocate
to
put
forth
issues
on
his
behalf.
at
the
same
time,
the
lawyer
is
confronted
with--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--under
anders,
he
is
entitled
to
that.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
should
the
court
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
case
is
wholly
frivolous.
however,
anders
does--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--right.
the
one
problem
i
think
with
that
analysis,
i
think
anders
does
require
you
to
be
an
advocate.
for
example,
anders
cites
as
its
support
the
case
of
ellis
v.
united
states.
ellis
v.
united
states
had
a
discussion
requirement
very
similar
to
the
one
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
adopted
in
this
case,
and
in
that
particular
case,
two
different
attorneys
evaluated
the
appeal,
cited
possible
issues
to
support
the
appeal,
and
then,
after
raising
those
issues,
then
proceeded
to
advise
the
court
why
those
issues
lacked
merit.
the
united
states
supreme
court
reversed
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
and
held
that
that
was
not
acting
as
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
client.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
no.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that
is
what
anders
says.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
i
don't
think
he
should.
i
think
at
that
point--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--no,
no.
i
think--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--right.
i
think
it
ties
into
justice
stevens'
question.
i
think
counsel
is
under
anders
supposed
to
make
a
vigorous
argument.
i
think
as
a
preface
to
the
argument,
counsel
must
advise
the
court
that,
in
his
opinion,
he
believes
the
argument
he
is
about
to
make
is
frivolous,
but
he
should
still
argue
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
client.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
in
anders,
that
essentially
is
correct.
however,
the
value
of
that
rule
and
the
reason
anders
is
a
difficult
case
for
an
appellate
lawyer
to
defend,
because
you
are
doing
exactly
that.
you
are
telling
the
court
that,
in
your
opinion,
the
case
is
frivolous.
however,
by--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
at
that
point,
by
telling
the
court
why
the
case
is
frivolous,
the
lawyer
is
doing
more
than
just
acknowledging
that,
in
his
opinion,
the
case
is
weak,
but
the
court
must
make
the
determination.
at
that
point,
counsel
is
now
providing
the
brief,
in
effect,
for
the
other
side.
you
are
now
briefing
both
sides
of
the
case.
here's
our
case,
here's
the
state's
case.
in
my
opinion,
i'd
side
with
the
state.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
and
that's
why
i
believe
that
anders
resolved
that
ethical
dilemma.
anders
says
in
that
situation,
we
give
you
permission
to
tell
us
that
the
case
is
frivolous,
but
we
still
want
you
to
argue
it.
so,
they
have
resolved
the
ethical
dilemma.
they
allow
the
attorney
to
be
ethical
because
you
are
telling
the
court
that
in
your
opinion
the
case
is
frivolous,
and
at
the
same
time,
they
allow
you
to
be
an
advocate.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
that's,
in
fact,
the
case
in--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
no.
the
lawyer
is
not
supposed
to
do
that,
and
we
are
not
arguing
that
there
are
attorneys
out
there
who
would
be
unethical.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
in
fact,
the
irony
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
decision,
if
it
had
really...
saves
the
court
no
time
whatsoever.
the
only
agency
that
is
saved
any
time
by
the
anders
procedure
is
the
agency
representing
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
court
in
either
case
has
to
evaluate
the
arguments
that
are
presented
to
it
by
appellate
counsel,
whether
it's
a
meritorious
appeal
or
whether
it's
a
no
merit
appeal.
the
public
defender
or
the
appointed
appellate
counsel
who
is
representing
the
defendant
has
to
brief
the
issues
in
either
situation,
advise
the
client
of
the
possible
ramifications
to
the
appeal,
his
analysis
of
the
merits
of
the
appeal,
and
whether
or
not
there's
a
possibility
of
success,
and
then
present
those
arguments
to
the
court.
the
only
one
who
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
in
this
situation
is
the
representative
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
because,
now,
appointed
appellate's
counsel
is
doing
their
job
for
them.
we
are
now
briefing
the
case
for
the
state.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
was
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
complained
about
the
money.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
in
wisconsin,
the
attorney
general's
office
is
not
supposed
to
file
a
response
brief
in
an
anders
situation.
in
fact,
they
have
taken
the
position
earlier
in
this
case
that
they
should
not
even
be
served
with
a
copy
of
the
brief
in
that
situation,
and
they
have
taken
a
consistent
position
that
they
do
not
have
to
respond
and
so
far
that
is
the
rule
of
law
in
wisconsin.
so,
you
are
not
anticipating
getting
a
response
from
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
an
anders
situation.
the
only
one
who
provides
the
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
an
anders
situation
is
the
attorney
for
the
client.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
actually,
it
does
not
because
by
providing
the
court
with
those
reasons,
assuming
that
you've
made
an
accurate
determination,
what
you
have
done
in
that
situation
is
told
the
court
why
the
case
lacks
merit.
it's
our
position
that
if
it
is
not
readily
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
anders
brief
why
that
case
is
frivolous,
then
perhaps
counsel
was
wrong
in
making
that
determination.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
but
the
answer
to
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
in
that
situation,
the
court
can
order
the
opposing
side
to
brief
the
case
for
the
other
side.
you
don't
need
for
counsel
to
step
in.
you
don't
need
to
increase
the
appellate
process.
you
still
have
an
advocate's
brief
on
behalf
of
the
client.
the
issues
are
still
highlighted.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
a
lawyer
does
that
when
he
makes
the
analysis
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
the
problem
is
not
with
making
the
analysis
for
the
case.
the
problem
is
within
providing
that
analysis--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--your
honor,
i've
only
filed
two
anders
briefs
in
my
life.
i
question
whether
i
should
have
filed
either
one
of
them.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
in
one
of
the
cases,
in
fact,
i
did
include
a
statement
of
the
reasons
at
my
client's
direction,
and
i
do
think
it
made
a
difference
because
his
case
came
subsequent
to
this
one.
his
conviction
has
already
been
affirmed.
that
is
one
of
the
unique
things
about
the
wisconsin
rule.
you
don't
dismiss
an
appeal
in
wisconsin
if
the
court
accepts
an
anders
brief.
you
affirm
the
conviction.
so,
he
has
an
appeal,
but
it's
not
the
same
type
of
appeal
that's
contemplated
by
the
constitution.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
no.
i
agree
the
constitution
does
not
contemplate
a
lot
of
frivolous
appeals.
i
think
counsel's
responsibility
is
to
try
to
argue
on
behalf
of
his
client
as
best
as
possible.
in
the
unlikely
event
that
you
do
have
or
the
unique
event
that
you
do
have
a
frivolous
appeal,
you're
still
obligated
until
you
are
allowed
to
withdraw
from
the
case
to
protect
that
appeal.
you
still
represent
the
client,
and
to
the
extent
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
client's
ethical
responsibility
and
a
client's
legal
responsibility
to
the
client
under
the
constitution,
it's
our
contention
that
the
constitution
should
control.
we
are
not
supposed
to
be
an
administrative
aid
to
the
court.
polk
county
v.
dodson,
the
court
made
it
clear.
the
client
is
supposed
to
have
the
undivided
loyalty
of
the
attorney,
and
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
admittedly
done
in
admitting
that
it
goes
beyond
anders
is
it
says,
no,
you
have
two
duties
in
this
case.
only
one
is
to
the
client,
the
other
is
to
the
court,
and
we
want
you
to
wear
both
hats
at
the
same
time,
and
that
provides
the
client,
and
this
goes
to
the
second
part
of
the
argument,
with
the
redefining
of
the
role
of
counsel,
that
provides
the
client
with
less
than
an
advocate.
you
are
not
being
an
advocate.
you
are
being
a
counselor
as
appellee
as
pointed
out--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
that.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
because
the
client
at
that
point
says,
i
have
a
right
to
an
appeal
and
i
want
the
appeal,
and
at
that
point,
the
lawyer's
duty
is
to
protect
that
appeal.
his
constitutional
duty.
because
he
has
the
right
to
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
not
as
a
matter
of
privilege.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
i
understand
your
concern,
justice
scalia.
the
problem
in
that
situation
is
that,
for
example,
if
we
liken
this
to
a
trial
situation
as
this
court
has
done
in
the
past,
in
evitts
v.
lucey,
they
described
the
role
of
counsel.
they
cited
strickland
v.
washington
and
united
states
v.
cronic.
if
you
liken
this
to
a
trial
situation,
this
would
be
akin
to
a
lawyer
coming
in
on
the
eve
of
trial,
evaluating
the
case,
telling
the
client
it's
obvious
that
you're
guilty,
it's
obvious
that
we
don't
have
a
prayer,
we
ought
to
plead
and
lake
the
best
deal
possible,
and
the
client
says,
no,
i
want
a
trial,
and
the
lawyer
says,
no,
i'm
going
to
plead
you
guilty.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
your
question
points
to
the
very
reason
why
this
case
is
here.
it
is
precisely
because
in
an
appellate
situation
that
the
burden
is
now
on
the
defendant.
precisely
because
a
defendant
now
needs
a
lawyer
to
act
as
a
sword
to
overturn
that
appeal,
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
the
role
of
counsel
becomes
critical
in
appeal.
it's
critical
at
that
point.
he
needs
help,
more
help
there
so
that
he
can
come
in
and
try
to
overturn
the
decision;
otherwise,
the
judgment
of
guilt
is
already
in,
he
has
already
been
sentenced,
and
there
is
nothing
further
that
can
be
done
on
his
behalf.
that
is
the
reason
why
counsel
is
critical
on
appeal.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
i
understand
your
concern,
justice
rehnquist.
that's
why
we
are
defending
the
anders
decision,
because
anders
came
down
with
a
compromise,
that
allowed
the
attorney
on
the
one
hand
to
try
to
remain
that
advocate
while,
on
the
other
hand,
recognizing
the
ethical
duty
of
the
lawyer
not
to
knowingly
file
a
frivolous
appeal
and
pass
it
off
as
a
meritorious.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
not
if
the
lawyer
is
going
to
remain
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
client.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
to
do
that,
you
are
no
longer
acting
in
the
role
of
advocate.
at
that
point,
the
client
no
longer
has
an
advocate
for
appeal.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
no.
i
do
think
that
the
lawyer
has
a
duty
to
the
court,
and
that
is
why
the
anders
decision
has
recognized
that
dilemma
and
tried
to
come
down
with
an
answer.
it's
an
answer
that
makes
everyone
uneasy.
no
appellate
lawyer
i
know
likes
the
anders
decision
because
it
puts
you
in
a
very
awkward
position
of
arguing
a
case
that
you
already
assessed
lacks
merit.
you
have
to
make
meritorious
arguments
to
the
best
of
your
ability
in
that
situation.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
yes,
but
it's
the
duty--
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
--i
think
in
that
situation,
it
can
only
do
so
if
it
redefines
the
role
of
either
the
appeal
or
counsel
in
that
setting
because
as
long
as
this
court
has
taken
the
position
that
a
client
is
entitled
to
the
adversarial
process
in
an
appeal,
and
as
long
as
this
court
has
taken
the
position
that
the
client
is
entitled
to
an
advocate,
to
then
say,
but
in
this
narrow
realm
of
cases,
we're
going
to
give
these
clients
less
than
that
is
giving
that
class
of
clients
less
than
the
advocacy
and
the
appellate
representation
than
other
clients
are
receiving.
so,
in
effect,
the
court
is
asking
us
to
wear
two
hats,
to
brief
both
sides,
to
be
more
of
an
administrative
aid
to
the
court,
and
actually
to
argue
as
an
amicus
curiae,
and
this
court
in
anders,
in
ellis,
in
evitts,
and
all
other
decisions
discussing
this
issue,
has
said
counsel
cannot
do
that,
counsel
cannot
act
as
an
amicus
curiae.
the
irony
of
the
state's
position
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
is
that
it's
far
less
onerous
to
argue
or
to
take
the
position
of
the
dissent
in
anders
as
it
is
to
take
the
position
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
this
case
because,
at
least
in
that
setting,
the
client
still
had
the
appeal
because
the
client
can
still
come
forward
and
make,
absence
of
counsel,
he
can
make
his
own
frivolous
arguments
and
still
have
a
full
appeal
on
the
merits.
in
this
setting,
the
client
does
not
receive
that.
he
receives
less
than
an
appeal.
he
receives
less
than
advocacy,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
to
adopt
this
procedure
is
to
provide
this
class
of
clients
with
less
than
that
they're
entitled
to
under
wisconsin
law.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
she
was.
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
she
called
for
in
her
dissent
a
re-evaluation
of
the
rule.
there
are
obviously
problems
to
this
dilemma
that
appellate
counsel
faced,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
position
that
protects
the
rights
of
the
client
and
the
ethical
duties
of
the
lawyer
better
than
anders.
so,
it
is
our
position
that
we
would
ask
that
this
court
reaffirm
anders
and
reverse
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
i
would
ask
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
yes.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
very
briefly,
one
of
the
arguments
advanced
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
this
case
is
to
argue
that
there
is
no
way
any
so-called
no
merit
letter
to
determine
if
an
attorney
acts
as
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
client.
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
this
case
does
not
present
that
situation.
this
is
a
case
where
counsel
has
identified
issues
on
behalf
of
the
client,
so
the
court
is
in
a
better
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
counsel's
assessment
is
accurate
based
on
the
identification
of
those
issues.
this
is
not
the
same
as
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
anders.
in
addition,
the
state
has
conceded
once
again
here
in
the
argument
that
a
client
will
not
receive
a
full
appeal
in
an
anders
situation.
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
wisconsin
constitutional
provision
that
provides
that
all
criminal
defendants
receive
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
making
that
ruling
basically
admitted
that
it
was
going
beyond
the
requirements
of
anders
and
that
it
was
asking
an
attorney
to
do
something
more
than
remain
as
an
advocate.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that
it's
strictly
a
violation
of
the
wisconsin
constitution,
from
that
standpoint.
our
argument
is
that
by
requiring
an
attorney
to
act
as
less
than
an
advocate,
which
is
what
the
6th
amendment
requires,
and
by
requiring
an
attorney,
once
the
state
provides
for
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
to
provide
the
client
with
less
than
that
appeal,
then
the
14th
amendment
and
the
6th
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
have
been
violated.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
the
issues
that
have
been
identified
are
in
the
record.
the
issues
that
were
identified,
the
attorney,
myself,
after
identifying
the
issues,
gave
a
preface
to
those
issues
indicating
that,
in
my
opinion,
those
issues
are
wholly
frivolous
and
lack
arguable
merit.
however,
here
they
are.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
those
are
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
that's
correct.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
11.
mr.
louis
bennett
butler,
jr.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
