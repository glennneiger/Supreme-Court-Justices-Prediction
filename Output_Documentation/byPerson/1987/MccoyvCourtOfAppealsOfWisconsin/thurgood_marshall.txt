justice
marshall
it
has
been
done.
what
about
a
case
where
the
lawyers
argue
the
case
and
haven't
read
the
briefs.
the
judge
says,
well,
look,
is
your
only
part
in
this
that
the
man
was
convicted
on
three
counts
and
was
sentenced
on
count
two
before
he
was
sentenced
on
count
one.
and
he
says,
yes,
that's
the
only
point.
he
said,
why
are
you
bringing
it
here.
he
said,
well,
i
was
appointed
and
the
client
insisted
on
it.
well,
all
he
wasted
was
five
minutes
of
the
court's
time.
that's
all.
justice
marshall
is
it
true
that
the
government
does
not
file
briefs
in
these
cases?
justice
marshall
so,
there's
no
appeal?
