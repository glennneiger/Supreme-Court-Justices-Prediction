but
for
what
it's
worth,
it
does
relieve
you
as
representative
of
the
state
of
a
duty
to
brief
the
case.
justice
blackmun
why
should
they
be
relieved?
justice
blackmun
why
should
the
court
have
to
determine
whether
there
is
or
is
not
merit
after
an
anders
brief
is
filed?
why
isn't
that
your
job?
justice
blackmun
i
still
ask,
why
isn't
it
your
job,
though?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
who
benefits
is
the
state
attorney.
