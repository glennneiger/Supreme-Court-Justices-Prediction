justice
o'connor
and
we've
said
that
that
doesn't
violate
the
6th
amendment.
justice
o'connor
so,
why
does
it
violate
the
6th
amendment
for
the
lawyer
to
tell
the
court
why
he
thinks
it's
frivolous?
justice
o'connor
well,
a
lawyer
has
an
ethical
obligation
under
some
circumstances
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
authorities
on
the
other
side,
doesn't
he?
justice
o'connor
or
she?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
butler,
suppose
the
state
as
a
matter
of
course
set
these
appeals
for
a
limited
oral
argument
in
each
instance,
and
the
lawyer
comes
in
representing
the
defendant
and
has
indicated
to
the
court
that
the
lawyer
wants
to
withdraw,
and
the
reason
is
the
lawyer
thinks
that
it's
frivolous,
do
you
think
the
court
can
properly
ask
the
lawyer
to
justify
that
orally
and
say,
tell
me
why
you
think
we
should
let
you
withdraw?
tell
me
why.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
the
court
can
properly
even
ask
the
lawyer
at
oral
argument
to
explain?
justice
o'connor
then
you
think
that
the
lawyer
has
no
duty
to
the
court,
even
when
the
court
asks
the
lawyer's
help?
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
recognize
that
every
lawyer
has
two
loyalties,
in
effect;
one
to
the
client
and
one
to
the
court?
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
yes,
that's
right,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
can
ask
the
lawyer
to
tell
the
court
why
the
lawyer
is
taking
a
certain
position.
in
this
case,
the
court
has
made
a
universal
question,
tell
me
why.
