justice
scalia
yes,
but
that's
not
what
brings
you
here.
i
mean,
you're
not
complaining
about
saving
the
state
money.
you're
complaining
about
prejudice
to
your
client.
justice
scalia
right.
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
assume
that
the
state
would
come
in
with
an
opposing
brief
anyway,
the
only
effect...
the
only
possible
effect
of
making
counsel
state
why
he
thinks
it's
frivolous
is
to
enable
the
court
more
readily
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
his
reasons
are
wrong.
don't
you
think
if
you're
going
to
have
a
brief
for
the
other
side
from
the
state
anyway,
don't
you
think
it
would
more
likely
help
than
harm
the
individual
defendant
for
counsel
who
has
very
bad
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
appeal
is
frivolous
to
set
forth
those
very
bad
reasons
in
a
brief
and
the
court
can
look
at
it
right
away?
otherwise,
all
the
court
knows
is,
well,
he's
made
these
arguments,
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts,
he
thinks
it's
all
nonsense.
i
don't
see
how
your
client
is
hurt
by
that.
justice
scalia
well,
wisconsin
can
well
look
at
it
a
different
way,
that
the
reason
he's
setting
forth
the
causes
for
frivolousness
are
not
to
harm
his
client,
but,
rather,
to
justify
to
the
court
his
withdrawal
from
the
case.
now,
there
do
arise
situations
where
a
lawyer
has
two
obligations;
one
to
the
court,
one
to
the
client.
in
justifying
his
actions
to
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
he
is
certainly
being
no
less
loyal
to
the
client
that
by
the
mere
fact
of
his
saying
i
will
not
take
an
appeal.
i
mean,
at
that
point,
he's
already
betrayed
the
client
if
you
consider
that
a
betrayal.
from
there
on,
all
he's
doing
is
justifying
to
the
court
the
reason
for
his
withdrawal,
so
that
the
court,
if
it
sees
that
the
reason
is
no
good,
can
take
appropriate
action
to
be
sure
that
a
proper
appeal
is
litigated.
