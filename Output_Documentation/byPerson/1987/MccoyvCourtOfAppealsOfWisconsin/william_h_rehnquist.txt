mr.
butler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that's
the
result
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
decision?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what's
the
matter
with
that
result?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
indigent
defendants
who
will
get
appeals
as
a
matter
of
right
as
in
wisconsin
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
counsel,
but
we
have
cases
that
say
they're
not
going
to
get
everything
that
the
well-heeled
criminal
defendant
is
going
to
get.
it
just
isn't
in
the
nature
of
things.
probably
a
well-heeled
defendant
can
walk
into
some
law
office
and
plunk
down
enough
money
to
get
the
lawyer
to
make
any
claim
the
defendant
tells
him
to
make.
it's
unfortunate,
but
it's
true.
but
certainly
you
don't
contend
that
the
indigent
defendant
is
entitled
to
that
sort
of
service,
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
the
kiss
of
death
in
any
real
live
court,
is
to
say
i'm
going
to
make
the
following
points
and
i
intend
to
make
them
very
vigorously,
but
i
want
to
tell
you
beforehand
that
i
think
it's
all
a
pile
of
junk.
that's
really
what
he's
saying.
by
asking
to
resign.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
butler,
i
think
there
is
a
good
deal
of
difference
between
a
trial
situation
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
always
on
the
government
and
any
competent
attorney
knows
that
he
represents
the
defendant
by
simply
putting
the
government
to
its
proof,
just
by
cross
examining,
and
on
the
other
hand,
on
appeal,
you
get
into
situations,
which
i
daresay
you've
confronted
some
yourself
having
filed
two
anders,
where
you
have
to...
you
know,
the
burden
of
proof
is
no
longer
on
the
government,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
appellant,
and
there
just
isn't
much...
there's
virtually
nothing
to
complain
about.
everything
that
you
asked
the
trial
court
to
do,
the
trial
court
did.
the
jury
still
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
would
agree,
i
take
it,
that
there
are
some
appeals,
i
don't
know
how
large
a
class
it
is,
that
even
the
best
lawyer
in
the
world
has
virtually
no
chance
of
getting...
of
succeeding
on;
whereas,
it's
not
nearly
as
easy
to
evaluate
that
in
the
trial
situation.
everybody
agrees
that
abandoning
a
client
or
saying
i
think
your
defense
is
frivolous,
therefore
i
won't
represent
you
in
trial,
it
just
can't
be
done.
it
isn't
done.
it
isn't
a
problem.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
justice
abrahamson,
who
dissented
below,
was
very
happy
with
the
anders
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
butler.
mr.
kleinmaier,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kleinmaier.
mr.
butler,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
didn't
think
it
was
contrary
to
the
wisconsin
constitution
or
they
wouldn't
have
said
it
was
all
right.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
is
undoubtedly
a
federal
constitutional
question.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
rely
here
on
a
violation
of
the
wisconsin
constitution
when
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
has
upheld
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
butler.
the
case
is
submitted.
