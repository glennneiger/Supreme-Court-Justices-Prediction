justice
white
but
if
he
points
out
those
arguable
basis
for
the
appeal,
and
then
in
the
last
line
says
i
resign,
please
let
me
out,
and
the
court
lets
him
out,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
is
there?
justice
white
that's
what
anders
says.
justice
white
and
he
doesn't
need
to
give
any
reason
for
asking
to
resign
or
to
get
out?
justice
white
so,
it's
just
to
be
inferred
that
my
mother-in-law
is
sick
or
what?
is
it
i
just
haven't
got
time
or--
justice
white
--it's
really
inferred
that
he
thinks
it's
frivolous.
justice
white
and
so
he
can't
be
sanctioned
then,
i
suppose.
justice
white
because
most
lawyers
have,
at
least
under
the
current
rules,
have
an
obligation
not
to
file
frivolous
papers.
justice
white
because
they
can
be...
certainly,
in
the
trial
court,
rule
11
would
catch
them,
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
so,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
say
that
even
a
well-paid...
even
a
paying
client
isn't
entitled
to
a
lawyer
who
will
file
frivolous
cases.
the
lawyer
isn't
supposed
to
do
that.
justice
white
does
the
state's
procedure
here
satisfy
the
anders
requirement
that
the
attorney
point
to
anything
in
the
record
that
arguably
supports
his
client?
justice
white
and
then
he
says,
but
this
is
frivolous?
justice
white
because
these
things
are...
these
arguments
are
so
baseless,
they're
frivolous,
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
justice
harlan
in
anders
has
said
that
you
can't
really
point...
if
you
can
point
to
anything
that's
arguable,
it
just
isn't
frivolous.
justice
white
anders
didn't
say
on
its
face
that
you
weren't
entitled
not
only
to
satisfy
what
the
court
said
the
attorney
had
to
say,
but
it
didn't
say
that...
it
didn't
hold
that
the...
that
it
was
impermissible
for
the
lawyer
to
explain
why
he
thought
it
was
frivolous.
justice
white
but
i
suppose
the
case
that's
arguably
more
against
this
wisconsin
procedure
is
ellis.
justice
white
that's
a
short
precarium,
but
it
doesn't
say
very
much.
justice
white
do
you
know
where
we
could
find
or
i
could
find
an
example
of
a
brief
that
satisfies
the
wisconsin
rule?
because
the
one
that
was
filed
in
mr.
mccoy's
case
here,
i
guess,
he
said
he
purported
to
comply
with
anders
but
left
out
the
explanation
of
frivolity.
justice
white
and
that's
the
way
this
original
proceeding
got
started.
justice
white
you
say
that
it's
possible
to
file
a
letter
that
satisfies
both
anders
and
the
wisconsin
rule,
i
take
it?
don't
you?
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
justice
white
all
you
have
to
do
is
add
to
an
anders
brief
when
you
say,
i
think
that
the
case
is
frivolous,
i
want
to
withdraw,
and
here's
why
i
think
it's
frivolous.
justice
white
but
you
think
it's
possible
to
write
a
letter
that
satisfies
both
anders
and
the
wisconsin
rule?
justice
white
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
and
there's
nothing...
not
in
this
record,
is
there,
an
example
of
the
letter--
justice
white
--so,
we
really
are
sort
of
dealing
in
an
abstraction.
justice
white
are
you
the
one
who
filed
the
anders
letter?
justice
white
and
said
that
you
couldn't
really...
and
you
left
out
the
explanation
of
frivolity?
justice
white
thank
you
very
much.
