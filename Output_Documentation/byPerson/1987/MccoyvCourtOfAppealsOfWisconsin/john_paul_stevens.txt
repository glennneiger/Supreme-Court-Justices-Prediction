justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
mr.
butler,
right
there?
assuming
you
just
applied
anders
as
written
and
you
don't
have
this
additional
requirement
of
a
lawyer
explaining
why
he
thinks
it's
frivolous,
do
you
think
the
normal
anders
case
in
which
the
lawyer
files
an
anders
brief,
in
which
he
makes
the...
identifies
the
arguable
arguments
on
behalf
of
his
client
and
then
says,
but
i
think
they're
frivolous,
do
you
think
that
takes
it
out
of
the
adversarial
process?
justice
stevens
you
think
that
is
the
same
advocacy
that
the
rich
person
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned
would
get?
justice
stevens
it
is
the
same
advocacy
that
the
rich
client
would
get?
do
you
think
his
client
is
going
to
go
in
and
make
some
arguable
things,
saying
yes,
but
i
think
it's
frivolous
and
i'd
like
to
withdraw?
justice
stevens
what
we've
got
is
a
case
where
the
paying
client,
if
he's
got
a
conscience
lawyer,
would
say
to
him,
you're
going
to
waste
your
money.
i'm
telling
you
that
in
advance.
it's
not
worth
$5,000
to
file
this.
of
course,
if
you
want
to
throw
your
money
away,
i'll
file
your
papers
for
you.
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
poor
defendant
is
entitled
to
have
the
state
waste
the
same
amount
of
money.
justice
stevens
that's
correct.
justice
stevens
but
he's
not
under
anders.
he's
not
under
anders
entitled
to
that.
justice
stevens
no,
he's
not
entitled
to
the
vigorous
advocacy.
he's
entitled
to
have
the
points
identified,
the
colorable
basis
identified
and
then
the
lawyer
is
entitled
to
withdraw.
justice
stevens
but
he
doesn't
go
in
and
make
a
vigorous
argument,
don't
let
me
withdraw.
he
files
his
brief
with
the
arguable
points
in
it
and
says
i
think
these
are
frivolous.
and
then
he's
out
and
if
the
court
thinks
there's
anything
in
it,
they
appoint
a
new
lawyer
under
anders.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
hurts
your
client.
that's
the
question.
(a)
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
actually
benefit
the
client
in
some
cases
because
i've
had
cases
where
i
thought
the
answer
was
perfectly
clear
and
then
i
started
to
write
out
the
reasons
why
it's
clear
and
i
find,
well,
it
isn't
really
all
that
clear,
and
if
you
come
to
a
conclusion
that
something
is
frivolous,
say,
oh,
there's
nothing
to
this
case,
and
then
you
have
to
explain
why,
you're
going
to
be
darn
sure
it
is
frivolous.
it's
easy
sometimes
in
a
big
record
to
say
that
i
don't
think
there's
anything
here.
so,
doesn't
the
requirement
of
articulating
the
basis
for
the
conclusion
it's
frivolous
actually
provide
some
protection
to
the
client?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
he
is
wrong,
he
won't
be
able
to
spell
out
satisfactory
reasons
and
he'll
change
his
mind.
but
if
he
can
just
file
it
without
stating
the
reasons,
he's
going
to
go
ahead
and
make
some
mistakes.
that's
my
point.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
in
that
case,
it
would
be
better
for
the
lawyer
to
find
out
himself
that
he
was
initially
wrong
in
his
judgment
of
frivolity
or
frivolousness,
whatever
the
right
word
is,
and
to
correct
it
himself
and
say,
no,
there
is
some
merit
to
it,
rather
than
filing
an
anders
brief
without
an
explanation
and
then
having
the
state
say,
well,
he
acknowledges
frivolous,
so
that's
it.
justice
stevens
well,
you
hope
he
does.
justice
stevens
well,
if
he
does
it,
how
often
does
he
do
it
wrong?
how
many
anders
briefs
have
you
filed
that
you
think
you
shouldn't
have
filed?
justice
stevens
in
those
cases,
do
you
think
it
would
have
really
made
any
difference
if
you'd
included
the
statement
of
reasons?
justice
stevens
well,
except
the
constitution
doesn't
really
contemplate
an
awful
lot
of
frivolous
appeals.
i
mean,...
well,
anyway.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you're
arguing...
you
say
he's
entitled
to
the
undivided
loyalty
of
the
lawyer.
well,
the
lawyer
gives
him
his
undivided
loyalty
and
when
he
says
to
him,
i
recognize
you
want
to
appeal
but
there
is
absolutely
no
merit
to
this
appeal,
it's
a
waste
of
time
and
money
and
everything
else,
and,
so,
i
don't
think
you
should
appeal.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
that.
justice
stevens
and
then
he
goes
on
and
he
says,
moreover,
since
it's
frivolous,
i
have
an
ethical
duty
not
to
prosecute
it
and
to
advise
the
court
of
it.
why
is
that
inconsistent
with
his
duty
to
his
client?
justice
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
in
ellis,
both
sides
agreed
the
appeal
was
not
frivolous?
that's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
these
others.
justice
stevens
the
solicitor
general
agreed
when
the
case
was
before
us
that
it
was
not
a
frivolous
case.
justice
stevens
well,
surely
you
can't
withdraw
under
anders
just
because
you
think
the
odds
are
against
you
on
that.
justice
stevens
then
you
wouldn't
have
any
criminal
appeals
if
that
was
the
case.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
before
this
rule...
how
long
has
the
rule
been
in
its
present
form?
justice
stevens
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
before
1978,
when
an
anders
brief
was
filed
without
an
explanation
of
why
it
was
frivolous,
did
the
state
then
respond?
justice
stevens
so,
that
hasn't
changed.
i
mean,
in
either
event,
once
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
represented
to
the
court
there's
a
frivolous
appeal,
the
attorney
general's
office
says
this
is
not
a
case
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
on.
don't
file
anything.
justice
stevens
mr.
butler,
just
to
help
me
out
on
one
thing.
you
say
that
in
this
case,
the
lawyer
did
find
there
were
arguable
claims
that
could
have
been
asserted
on
appeal.
are
those
in
the
record,
what
those
points
were?
justice
stevens
but
can
you
tell
me
where
in
the
record
those
issues
are
identified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
third
case
involves
a
rather
difficult
area
concerns
the
problem
confronted
by
a
lawyer
who
is
appointed
to
represent
an
indigent
defendant
on
appeal,
who
concludes
that
the
appeal
has
absolutely
no
merit
and
is
actually
frivolous.
wisconsin
has
rule
that
requires
such
a
lawyer
to
--
who
must
--
who
may
--
who
may
face
an
ethical
obligation
to
withdraw
to
file
a
brief
with
the
appellate
court
explaining
not
only
what
arguments
are
available
in
support
of
the
appeal,
but
also
the
reasons
why
the
lawyer
has
concluded
that
the
appeal
is
frivolous.
puts
the
lawyer
in
the
difficult
position
of
setting
forth
reasons
that
are
opposed
to
the
interest
of
his
or
her
client.
and
we
are
asked
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
rule,
and
in
the
divided
court,
we
conclude
that
the
rule
does
give
the
--
does
not
infringe
the
client's
right
to
effective
representation
by
counsel
because
in
preparing
the
explanation
for
the
lawyers
decision,
it
is
necessary
first
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
merits
of
the
case
and
the
brief
will
enable
the
court,
the
appellate
court
to
determine
whether
the
client
has
in
fact
received
effective
representation
before
the
decision
to
ask
for
withdrawal
was
made.
so,
we
affirm
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
decision
upholding
the
validity
of
the
rule.
but
justice
brennan
joined
by
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
