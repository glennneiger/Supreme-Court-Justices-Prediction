mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
ironic
that
in
an
attack
on
the
wisconsin
procedure,
which
requires
the
defense
attorney
to
explain
the
reasons
for
reaching
a
conclusion
an
appeal
is
frivolous,
the
case
is
based
on
the...
the
argument
is
based
on
anders
because
in
the
anders
case,
the
petitioner
himself,
one
of
the
remedies
he
thought
would
be
better
than
the
situation
he
faced
was
to
have
the
defense
attorney
provide
an
explanation.
as
quoted,
the
source
of
this
is
a
footnote
in
nickols,
the
nickols
v.
gagnon
case.
the
brief
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
in
anders
recommended
a
procedure
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
because
it
afforded
more
adequate
protection
because
counsel
must
convince
the
court
that
the
issues
are
truly
frivolous.
that's
what
essentially
the
discussion
requirement
of
the
wisconsin
rule
is.
the
defense
attorney
who
has
stated
that...
set
forth
the
facts
and
the
law
then
asks...
states
it's
frivolous
and
seeks
to
withdraw
and
all
this
discussion
requirement
does
it
ask
him
to
explain
why
he
reached
that
conclusion,
and
in
making
that
requirement
on
the
attorney,
i
think
that
is
completely
consistent
with
the
anders
decision
and--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--yes,
sir.
as
part
of
the
procedure
in
wisconsin
also,
the
attorney
cites
the
facts
and
the
legal
authority.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
yes.
the
wisconsin
procedure
was
the
court's
attempt.
the
rule
is
a
codification
of
the
wisconsin
case
of
cleghorn
v.
state,
which
was
a
wisconsin
court's
attempt
to
implement
the
anders
decision.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that's
a
difficult
part
of
implementing
the
anders
decision,
and
i
think
what
maybe
what's
required
is
that
the
defense
attorney
review
the
case
and
he
finds
it's
frivolous,
and
then
he
or
she
has
to
look
at
it
and
those
things...
when
you
review
a
record
that
you
find
is
frivolous,
there
are
certainly
going
to
be
things
that
draw
your
attention,
you
check
out,
because
it
just
doesn't
seem...
seems
out
of
the
ordinary.
in
reviewing
the
record
and
complying
with
anders,
the
attorney
would
then
point
out,
i
think,
the
things
that...
the
best
arguments
that
could
be
found,
and--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--right.
it
did
not
make
a
point
of
it
either
way.
in
fact,
in
a
footnote,
it
cited
the
district
of
columbia
rule
and
said
there
was
not
approving
or
disapproving
of
that
rule
in
the
anders
case.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well,
as
i
recall--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--and
that's
the
problem,
i
think,
that
it
doesn't
say
very
much
because
in
reading
the
case,
we
don't
know
what
exactly
it
was
the
attorneys
did.
there,
they
gave
an
evaluation.
i
think
a
distinction
between
an
amicus
and
an
advocate,
the
advocate
obviously
is
attempting
to
serve
his
client
and
he's
going
to
review
the
record
to
find
whether
there's
merit
or
whether
it's
frivolous,
he
has
to
review
all
the
facts
and
all
the
law
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
his
client
and,
if,
in
reviewing
it
that
way,
he
can
find
something
that
he
can
make
a
legitimate
argument
on,
then
he
should
pursue
the
appeal.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
but
i
think
that...
the
attorneys
who
had
reviewed
it
had
originally
reached
a
conclusion,
i
think,
based
on
the
argument
that--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--but
i
think
a
case
would
be
one
where
i
think
someone
could
look
at
it
and
say,
you're
probably
going
to
lose,
but
it's
not
frivolous
because
you
have
a
good
argument,
but
you
may
still
lose
it.
i
think
in
serving
your
client
as
an
advocate,
you're
going
to
look
at
a
case
and
say,
you
may
have
a
chance...
you
may
lose,
but
there's
a
very
good
argument
that
we
should
pursue.
the
amicus,
i
think,
would
take
more...
advising
the
court,
would
take
the
approach,
there
may
be
an
argument
but
it's
going
to
lose,
therefore
don't...
you
know,
the
advice
is
it's
a
losing
argument
and
stop
at
that
point.
that's,
i
think,
a
distinction
between
the
two
roles.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that's
precisely
right,
and
that's
where
i
think
the
attorney
acts
as
an
advocate
because
he
doesn't
view
it
that
way.
he
looks
to
see
whether
there's
a
good
argument
he
can
make,
even
though
it
might
lose.
if
he
can
convince
the
court,
he
may
be
the
one
able
to
do
it.
i
think
the
discussion
requires
in
compliance
with
the
policy,
an
important
concern
of
anders
is
there's
a
statement
in
the
anders
case,
the
court,
in
reviewing
the
letter
submitted
by
the
attorney
there,
said
one
of
the
problems
was
there
was
no
way
to
determine
whether
the
attorney
had
acted
as
an
advocate
when
he
reviewed
the
record
and
the
law.
this
discussion
requirement
provides
that
information
to
the
court.
if
the
attorney
just
cites
facts,
cites
some
cases,
and
then
jumps
to
the
statement,
the
case
is
frivolous,
there's
no
way
to
tell
whether
he
evaluated
the
law
properly.
when
he
gives
the
evaluation,
the
court
can
then
determine
whether
he
reviewed
the
case
as
an
advocate
or
more
in
the
light
of
an
amicus
where
he's
just
saying
it
might
be
a
losing
case.
in
addition,
when
he
does
this,
there's
another
concern
that's
been
pointed
out,
that
this
constitutes
briefing
the
case
against
the
client
in
violation
of
anders.
i
don't
think
it
does.
anders
already
tells
the
attorney
to
cite
the
facts,
cite
some
authorities,
advise
the
court
if
you've
concluded
the
case
is
frivolous,
and
ask
the
court
to
withdraw.
i
think
that
the
additional
step
of
simply
explaining
how
it
jumped
from
law
and
authorities
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
frivolous
does
not
constitute
briefing
the
case
against
the
client.
the
damage
that
is
done
is
flagging
the
case
as
being
frivolous.
simply
to
explain
how
he
got
to
that
conclusion
is
not
going
to
do
further
damage
to
the
client.
it's
simply
going
to
help
the
court
review
the
case.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
think
that's
part
of
the
whole
process,
because
if
the
state
is
briefing
the
case,
what
you
have
is
an
appeal.
you
have
a
brief
filed
for
the
client,
the
defendant;
a
brief
filed
for
the
state,
and
you
have
the
court
deciding
it,
and
that's
a
full-fledged
appeal,
whereas
this
is
part
of
a
process
that
recognizes
that
frivolous
cases
should
not
be
brought...
followed
up
on
a
full
appeal,
and
this
is
a
method
of
relieving
the
attorney
from
representation
before
the
appeal
is
brought.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
so
that
the...
the
defense
lawyer?
because
the
appeal
is
frivolous
and
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
the
courts
should
not
be
clogged
up
with
frivolous
appeals.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
not
in
wisconsin.
if
the
court...
the
defense
lawyer
files
the
no
merit
report,
if
the
court
finds
merit,
then
it's
sent
back
to
the
attorney
or
a
new
attorney
and
the
case
is
briefed
and
then
it
follows
through
regular
appeals.
the
state
would
file
a
brief,
of
course.
but,
no,
the
state
does
not
file
any
response
to
the
no
merit
report.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well,
this
court
said
in
anders
that
the
court
has
the
responsibility
to
make
the
independent
determination
whether
the
appeal
is
frivolous,
and--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--yes,
there
is
some
benefit,
but,
again,
i
think
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
avoid
an
appeal
because
the
issue
is
determined
as
frivolous,
and
if
you
have
the
state
responding,
that
is
an
appeal.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
the...
the
full
appeal
in
wisconsin,
there...
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
in
criminal
cases,
i
think
in
all
cases,
the
court
of
appeals,
there
are
very
few
oral
arguments
and
the
entire
appeal
constitutes
briefs
being
filed
by
each
side
and
the
court
reaching
a
decision.
so,
another
question,
i
guess,
is
if
the
state...
if
the
attorney
general's
office
is
involved
on
behalf
of
the
state,
what
kind
of
brief
was
filed.
is
this
one...
what
you
have
is
a
report
from
the
defense
attorney
saying
the
case
is
frivolous.
is
the
state
then
supposed
to
respond
and
say
no,
it's
not
frivolous?
the
state's
position
would
normally
be
that
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
think
since
1978.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i'm
not
sure
if
even
before
this
rule,
if
the
briefs...
if
the
no
merit
reports
were
even
filed
with
the
attorney
general's
office.
i
think
they
were
filed
with
the
court.
i'm
not
sure
about
that
point.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
right.
i--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--right.
to
get
a
brief
filed
in
compliance
with
that
rule,
the
only
source
that
i
would
think
of
would
be
the
clerk's
office
for
the
wisconsin
courts.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well,
what
i
meant
was
i--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--that's
right.
we
acknowledge
that
it
is
in
addition
to
anders.
i
mean,
anders
itself
does
not
specifically
require
it.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well,
i
think
that
if
you
satisfy
the
wisconsin
rule,
you
will...
you
have
satisfied
anders
because
the
wisconsin
rule
requires
the
same
thing
as
anders,
and,
in
addition,
specifically
requires
the
attorney
explain.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
no,
it's
not
a
situation
where
the
evidence
was
introduced
that
would
have
precluded.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
yes.
in
that
regard,
yes.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
also
pointed
out
one
of
the
rationales
for
this,
and
i
think
it
is
a
fact,
and
this
is
also
consistent
with
anders,
that
the
documents
submitted
by
the
no
merit
report
is
of
assistance
to
the
court
and
assistance
to
the
court
was
one
of
the
policies
or
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
in
anders
said
was
to
be
accomplished
by
the
report,
and
this
requirement
to
assist
the
court
by
helping
it
in
its
independent
review
it
has
to
undertake,
but
it
will
be
of
assistance
to
get
the
analysis
from
the...
the
evaluation
from
the
defense
attorney
also.
i
think
that
concludes
the
argument.
