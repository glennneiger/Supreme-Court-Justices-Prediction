turn
out
that

give
me
the
case
that
was
over
120
days
where
the
complainant
recovered
in
the
state

well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
marshall
do
you
mean
this
is
the
first
time
you
knew
the
statute
was
in?
justice
marshall
but
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books.
justice
marshall
and
when
you
filed
a
case
you
knew
that
you
had
to
not
apply
to
it,
and
instead
of
going
to
the
federal
court
you
went
to
the
state
court,
period,
end
quote.
justice
marshall
well,

else
do
you
have?
