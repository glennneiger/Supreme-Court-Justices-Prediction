justice
jr.
how
is
the
issue
whether
the
municipality
has
been
prejudiced,
how
is
that
decided?
justice
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
an
actual
notice.
the
four
months
has
gone
by.
now
there
is
something
that
you
say
satisfies
the
actual
notice.
justice
jr.
but
the
plaintiff
nevertheless
still
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
municipality
was
not
prejudiced.
justice
jr.
how
does
he
do
that?
justice
jr.
well,
how
does
he
get
into
court?
justice
jr.
how
does
he
get
into
court?
justice
jr.
i
thought
you
said
no
lawsuit
until
after
he
has
satisfied
the
requirement
of
proving
that
the
municipality
was
not
prejudiced.
where
does
he
do
that?
justice
jr.
he
files
the
lawsuit?
justice
jr.
now,
wait
a
minute.
first
he
gives
actual
notice,
whatever
that
may
be.
justice
jr.
i
thought
he
couldn't
do
that
until
he
established
that
the
municipality
was
not
prejudiced.
justice
jr.
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
second,
the
actual
notice
provision.
justice
jr.
that's
two
different
things.
he
gives
you
actual
notice
and
he
files
a
lawsuit.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
how
much
time
after
he
has
given
you
actual
notice
does
he
have
before
he
may
file
the
lawsuit?
justice
jr.
how
much
time
after
he
has
given
actual
notice
does
he
have
to
file
the
lawsuit?
justice
jr.
including
proving
that
the
municipality
was
not
prejudiced?
justice
jr.
where
has
he
done
that?

this
--
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
nine
months
after
being
allegedly
beaten
by
milwaukee
police
officers
who
arrested
petitioner
on
a
disorderly
conduct
charge
that
was
later
dropped.
petitioner
filed
in
a
wisconsin
state
court,
this
action
under
the
federal
statute
42
u.s.c.
1983.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
beating
and
arrest
were
racially
motivated,
and
violated
the
plaintiff's
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution.
now,
wisconsin
has
a
notice
of
claim
statute,
which
provides
among
other
things
that
before
a
suit
like
this
may
be
brought
in
a
state
court
against
a
state
or
local
governmental
entity
or
officer,
the
plaintiff,
within
120
days
of
the
alleged
injury,
must
notify
the
defendant
of
the
circumstances
and
amount
of
the
claim
and
the
plaintiff's
intent
to
hold
the
named
defendant
or
defendants
liable.
the
defendant,
after
filing
that
notice,
then
has
120
days
to
grant
or
disallow
the
requested
relief.
if
the
defendant
denies
the
relief,
the
plaintiff
must
bring
suit
within
six
months
of
receiving
the
notice
of
disallowance.
the
trial
court
denied
a
motion
of
the
respondents
to
dismiss
the
suit
as
to
petitioner's
1983
claim
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute,
and
the
wisconsin
intermediate
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
however,
reversed
holding
that
while
congress
may
establish
the
procedural
framework
under
which
claims
are
heard
in
federal
courts,
states
retain
the
authority
under
the
constitution
to
prescribe
procedures
that
govern
actions
in
their
own
tribunals
including
actions
to
vindicate
congressionally
created
rights
such
as
the
rights
created
by
1983.
we
reversed
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
we
hold
that
because
wisconsin
notice
of
claim
statute
conflicts
both
in
its
purpose
and
the
fact
with
1983's
remedial
objectives,
and
because
its
enforcement
in
state-court
actions
will
frequently
and
predictably
produce
different
outcomes
in
1983
litigation
based
solely
on
whether
the
claim
is
asserted
in
state
or
a
federal
court,
the
notice
of
claim
statute
is
pre-empted
pursuant
to
the
supremacy
clause
when
the
1983
action
is
brought
in
a
state
court.
wisconsin's
notice
of
claim
statute,
we
think
undermines
1983's
unique
remedy
against
state
governmental
bodies
and
their
officials
by
conditioning
the
right
of
recovery
so
as
to
minimize
governmental
liability.
the
state
statute
also
discriminates
against
the
federal
right
against
the
state
of
--
affords
the
victim
of
an
intentional
tort
two
years
to
recognize
the
compensable
nature
of
his
or
her
injury
while
the
civil
rights
victim
is
given
only
four
months
to
appreciate
that
he
or
she
has
been
deprived
of
a
federal
constitutional
or
statutory
right.
moreover,
the
notice
provision
operates
in
part
as
an
exhaustion
requirement
by
forcing
claimants
to
seek
satisfaction
in
the
first
instance
from
the
governmental
defendant.
congress,
we
think,
never
intended
that
those
injured
by
governmental
wrongdoers
could
be
required,
as
a
condition
of
recovery,
to
submit
their
claims
to
the
government
responsible
for
their
injuries.
finally,
application
of
wisconsin's
statute
to
state-court
1983
actions
cannot
be
approved
as
a
matter
of
equitable
federalism.
just
as
federal
courts
are
constitutionally
obligated
to
apply
state
law
to
state
claims,
the
supremacy
clause
imposes
on
state
courts
a
constitutional
duty
to
proceed
in
such
manner
that
all
the
substantial
rights
of
the
parties
under
controlling
federal
law
are
protected.
a
state
law
that
predictably
alters
the
outcome
of
1983
claims
depending
solely
on
whether
they
are
bought
in
a
state
or
federal
court
within
the
state
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
the
federal
interest,
1983
was
enacted
by
the
congress
to
further.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
