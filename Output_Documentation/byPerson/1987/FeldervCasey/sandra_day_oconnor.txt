justice
o'connor
mr.
steinglass,
let
me
ask
before
you
launch
into
that
another
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
state
statute.
does
it
require
or
apply
if
the
suit
in
the
state
court
is
against
the
employee
in
his
individual
capacity?
justice
o'connor
and
your
suit
here
or
the
plaintiff's
suit
here
was
against
employees
in
both
their
official
capacity
and
their
individual
capacity?
justice
o'connor
but
the
court
below
didn't
make
any
distinction,
i
gather.
justice
o'connor
did
you
ask
the
court
to
make
such
a
distinction--
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
steinglass,
it
does
strike
me
that
just
possibly
people
who
want
to
rely
on
state
courts
for
their
litigation
and
file
suit
there
generally
speaking
have
to
take
those
courts
as
they
find
them,
with
whatever
procedural
requirements
those
courts
employ.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
with
the
fela
one
can
say
that
congress
was
addressing
specifically
the
procedural
requirements
that
were
to
be
met
in
those
cases,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
1983
litigation,
which
did
seem
to
be
addressed
to
opening
a
remedy
in
federal
courts.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
one
can
find
a
focus
and
a
congressional
intent
to
effect
those
very
things
in
that
particular
act,
but
i
am
not
sure
one
can
find
it
in
1983.
justice
o'connor
well,
how
would
it
have
been
possible
to
comply
afterwards
with
the
time
limit?
justice
o'connor
but
didn't...
i
thought
the
state
court
found
there
wasn't
actual
notice
here.
justice
o'connor
so
there
was
no
way
this
plaintiff
could
have
met
the
requirement.
justice
o'connor
was
the
suit
filed
within
the
initial
120-day
period?
justice
o'connor
no,
and
so
since
there
was
no
actual
notice,
there
would
be
no
way
this
plaintiff
could
have
complied,
as
i
see
it.
justice
o'connor
in
your
brief
on
page
22
you
appear
to
me
to
say
that
the
statute
requires
only
that
the
notice
of
claim
be
filed
no
later
than
120
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations.
that
seems
sort
of
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
mr.
langley,
does
the
statute
apply
at
all
to
a
suit
against
an
employee
in
the
individual
capacity
of
the
employee?
justice
o'connor
if
this
claim
had
been
filed...
if
the
suit
had
been
filed
in
federal
court,
do
you
think
that
the
state
could
apply
its
notice
of
claim
statute?
justice
o'connor
is
that
because
it
is
close
to
an
exhaustion
requirement
such
as
the
court
dealt
with
in
patsy?
justice
o'connor
mr.
langley,
the
city
certainly
can't
take
the
position
here
that
it
didn't
know
enough
of
the
underlying
facts
to
take
any
action
it
wanted
to
to
straighten
out
its
police
department
operation.
justice
o'connor
and
you
must
wait
120
more
days
to
give
the
municipality
the
opportunity
to
make
a
settlement
offer?
