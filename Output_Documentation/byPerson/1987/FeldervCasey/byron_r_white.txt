justice
white
six
months
from
what?
justice
white
so
a
notice
of
claim
must
be
filed
within
120
days
of
the
wrong?
justice
white
and
then
after
it's
filed
there's
another
120
days?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
could
the
wisconsin
courts
just
decline
to
entertain
1983
actions?
justice
white
is
there
any
decision
by
this
court
either
way?
justice
white
what
would
be
the
same
kind
of
claims?
justice
white
well,
you
know
the
wisconsin
courts
entertain
those.
justice
white
how
can
you
comply
with
it
after
120
days
has
run?
justice
white
i
thought
the
most
common
way
of
effecting
a
settlement
is
sue
somebody.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
you
could
come
back
and
negotiate
with
a
plaintiff
who
has
filed
a
suit.
justice
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
white
all
right.
within
three
years
the
plaintiff
gives
what
you
would
describe
as
actual
notice
to
the
city.
i
don't
know
what
that
is,
but
he
gives
them
actual
notice,
and
the
next
day
he
sues.
justice
white
well,
so
actual
notice
isn't
enough,
is
it?
justice
white
i
take
it
you
say,
in
effect
then
you
are
saying
that
the
requirement
that
you
give
notice
within
120
days
is
a
nullity
in
your
statute.
justice
white
well,
if
you
can
give
actual
notice
two
years
from
the
event,
which
you
say
you
can.
justice
white
well,
so
actual
notice
isn't
enough.
