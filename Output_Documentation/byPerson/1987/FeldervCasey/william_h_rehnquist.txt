chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-526,
bobby
felder
versus
duane
casey,
et
al.--
mr.
steinglass,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
steinglass--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--if
you
have
actual
notice,
is
any
writing
at
all
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
matter
of
decisional
law
then,
you
just
don't
know.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
steinglass,
is
your
principal
complaint
here
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
after
the
notice
is...
after
the
city
counsel
has
refused
to
act
or
the
requirement
of
a
notice
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
again,
we
don't
know
under
wisconsin
law
whether
if
you
file
the
notice
of
claim
and
it's
not
acted
on
by
the
city
council,
how
long
thereafter
you
have
to
file?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
see
exactly
why
the
length
of
the
limitations
period
is
involved
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
never
got
to
this
question,
as
i
understand.
it
could
have
decided
it
authoritatively
but
didn't
because
your
client
hadn't
filed
a
notice
of
claim.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
don't
know
whether
that's
true
in
wisconsin
or
not,
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
well,
i
thought
you
were
about
to
address
the
suitability
of
different
lengths
of
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
itself
has
imposed
that
sort
of
a
regimen
on
federal
tort
claims
act
cases,
hasn't
it?
don't
you
have
to
make
an
administrative
claim
first
if
you
are
suing
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
steinglass.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
langley.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
actual
notice,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
so
long
as
the
city
knows
some
time
during
the
period
of
the
overall
statute
of
limitations
that
you
have
a
claim
against
them,
that
is
actual
notice,
are
you?
because
surely
a
complaint
filed
in
the
circuit
court
would
be
actual
notice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
langley.
mr.
steinglass,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
steinglass.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-526,
felder
against
casey
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
