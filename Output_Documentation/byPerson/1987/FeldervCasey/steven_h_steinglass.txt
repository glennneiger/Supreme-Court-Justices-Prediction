mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
states
like
wisconsin,
which
opened
their
courts
to
1983
actions,
may
require
1983
plaintiffs
to
comply
with
notice
of
claims
statutes.
had
bobby
felder
filed
this
1983
action
in
the
federal
courts
he
would
not
have
been
required
to
comply
with
the
wisconsin
notice
of
claims
statute.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
acknowledged
this,
but
characterized
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
as
a
procedural
requirement,
and
relying
in
part
on
the
tenth
amendment,
held
that
state
courts
entertaining
1983
cases
could
require
compliance
with
state
procedural
rules
such
as
notice
of
claim
requirements.
despite
this
characterization
of
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
as
procedural,
the
requirement
has
nothing
to
do
with
regulating
the
conduct
of
litigation
in
the
state
courts.
the
notice
of
claim
statute
in
wisconsin
has
its
origin
in
legislation
enacted
in
response
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
abrogation
of
governmental
tort
immunity
in
1962.
in
addition
to
partially
restoring
governmental
immunity,
the
notice
of
claims
statute
established
a
condition
precedent
for
commencing
or
maintaining
civil
actions
in
the
state
courts
of
wisconsin
against
local
governmental
entities
and
their
employees.
to
maintain
such
a
suit,
a
prospective
plaintiff
must
serve
a
written
notice
of
the
circumstances
of
the
claim
within
120
days
of
the
event
giving
rise
to
the
claim.
when
a
governmental
employee
is
a
defendant,
as
in
the
present
case,
the
prospective
plaintiff
must
serve
the
notice
of
claim
on
both
the
governmental
entity
and
on
all
of
the
governmental
employees
in
the
case.
service
must
be
made
according
to
the
requirements
of
service
of
process
for
summons
under
wisconsin
law.
in
addition
to
the
notice
of
the
circumstances
of
the
claim,
a
claimant
must
also
present
an
itemized
statement
of
the
relief
sought.
this
itemized
statement
of
the
relief
sought
may
be
in
the
same
document,
but
it
need
not
be.
in
cases
involving
damages,
however,
it
must
contain
the
specific
sum
of
money
sought.
at
that
point
a
claimant
may
not
go
into
court.
there
is
a
120-day
waiting
period.
a
claimant
may
not
sue
until
the
claim
is
disallowed
or
until
the
120-day
period
expires.
at
that
time
there
is
a
six-month
statute
of
limitations
under
wisconsin
law
within
which
the
plaintiff...
the
claimant
must
bring
their
action.
the
statute
is
broadly
applicable
to
civil
actions
in
the
wisconsin
courts--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--six
months
from
the
date
on
which
the
claim
is
disallowed.
if
the
claim
is
disallowed
by
operation
of
law,
that
is,
because
the
common
counsel
has
taken
no
steps
on
it,
it
would
be
six
months
after
the
expiration
of
the
120-day
waiting
period.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no.
the
way
it
works,
your
honor,
is,
the
notice
of
claim
must
be
filed
within
the
120
days
of
the
event,
the
incident.
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
has
a
second
part
of
it.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that
second
notice
or
document
need
not
be
filed
right
away.
a
claimant
can
wait.
they
can
wait
two
months,
three
months,
several
months.
when
that
second
document,
which
contains
the
itemization
of
what
they
are
seeking,
is
filed,
then
the
120-day
waiting
period
begins
to
run
so
there
can
be
a
longer
period
of
time
that
elapses.
at
that
point
the...
after
the
disallowance,
of
course,
the
six
month
period
begins.
now,
there
is
some
flexibility
in
the
wisconsin
statute,
and
we
acknowledge
that
when
prospective
plaintiffs
do
not
file
their
formal
statutory
notice
of
claim
within
the
120-day
period
they
may
still
meet
the
conditions
of
the
statute
if
they
can
establish
the
following.
firstly,
they
must
establish
that
the
entity
had
actual
notice
of
the
injury.
secondly,
they
must
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
the
plaintiff
must
prove
a
negative.
the
plaintiff
must
demonstrate
that
the
defendants
were
not
prejudiced
by
virtue
of
the
absence
of
timely,
formal
statutory
notice.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
plaintiff
would
have
had
to
have
shown
that
the
city
of
milwaukee
and
all
ten
of
the
individual
defendants,
respondents
in
this
court,
were
not
prejudiced
by
virtue
of
their
not
having
received
formal
statutory
notice
within
the
120-day
period.
now,
the
wisconsin
courts
have
given
very
little
guidance
as
to
what
this
prejudice
requirement
means
or
how
a
plaintiff
is
to
establish
this
additional
element
of
their
case,
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
focus
of
that
inquiry
is
not
upon
why
the
plaintiff
did
or
did
not
file
their
notice
of
claim,
but
the
focus
is
solely
on
the
prejudice
to
the
defendants.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
the
statute
does
not
require
actual
notice.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
this
case
held
that
in
cases
in
which
documents
are
used
to
provide
the
actual
notice
they
must
meet
certain
minimal
requirements.
the
way
in
which
they
frame
that
leads
one
to
conclude
that
under
the
statute
something
other
than
documents
would
be
acceptable.
in
this
case
there
weren't
the
kinds
of
formal
documents
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
expected.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that,
i
think,
is
the
correct
answer.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
the
wisconsin
notice
of
requirement
is
inconsistent
with
section
1983.
now,
we
acknowledge
that
this
court
has
never
addressed
a
case
squarely
raising
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
section
1983
and
notice
of
claim
requirements.
nonetheless,
we
believe
that
decisions
of
this
court
construing
essential
attributions
of
a
section
1983
cause
of
action
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
is
improper.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
statute
refers
to
suits
against
the
employee
for
acts
done
in
their
official
capacity
or
in
the
course
of
their
agency
or
employment.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that
is
also
correct.
that
is
also
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
think
the
central
argument
that
was
made
in
the
case
below
was
that
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
was
simply
inapplicable
to
1983
cases,
and
a
secondary
argument
was
that
it
didn't
apply
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
don't
believe
the
specific
argument
that
you
raise
was
in
fact
raised
in
the
wisconsin
courts.
this
court
in
wilson
versus
garcia
addressed
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
in
section
1983
actions
and
held
that
in
each
state
there
should
be
a
single
limitations
period
for
1983
litigation,
and
that
that
limitations
period
should
be
the
limitations
period
for
general
personal
injury
actions.
the
wisconsin
court
of
appeals
in
the
present
case
identified
the
appropriate
limitations
period
in
this
case
as
three
years.
the
notice
of
claims
statute,
we
contend,
operates
to
cut
off
a
plaintiff's
right
to
sue
short
of
that
full
statutory
period.
now,
in
support
of
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
identified
as
the
primary
purpose
of
the
requirement
the
desire
to
settle
disputes
without
resort
to
litigation,
certainly
a
legitimate
purpose
in
the
abstract.
however,
this
court
rejected
that
identical
purpose
when
offered
by
the
state
of
maryland
as
a
justification
for
its
six-month
limitation
period
in
cases
involving
administrative
agency
allegations
of
employment
discrimination
in
burnett
versus
gratten.
but
the
court
has
noted
that
in
choosing
a
appropriate
limitations
period,
a
different
balance
of
interests
enters
into
a
state
decision
than
the
appropriate
balance
of
interests
that
should
be
considered
when
a
court
is
dealing
with
a
federally
created
cause
of
action.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
i
think
this
case
principally
involves
the
requirement
of
a
notice
at
all.
one
of
the
ambiguities
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
decision
is,
they
never
addressed
whether
they
believed
that
the
six-month
limitations
period
is
applicable.
the
wisconsin
court
of
appeals
held
it
was
a
full
three-year
period,
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
dismissed
this
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
file
the
initial
notice
of
claim
within
120
days
of
the
incident,
and
did
not
give
actual
notice
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
we
have
no
definitive
ruling
as
to
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
thinks
about
that.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
if
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
applies
in
federal
court?
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
why
the
plaintiff
chose
the
state
courts
rather
than
the
federal
courts,
but
congress
gave
plaintiffs
that
choice,
and
that
is
part
of
our
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
i
have
practiced
law
in
wisconsin
for
many
years,
and
the
wisconsin
courts
are
perfectly
fine
courts,
quite
capable
of
dealing
with
1983
issues
and
other
federal
rights,
and
the
plaintiff
made
that
decision.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
what?
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
apparently.
that's
why
we're
here
today,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
that
is
clear.
in
looking
at
limitations,
period,
this
court
has
required
a
review
of
the
practicalities
of
litigation.
i
just
want
to
talk
about
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
there
is
a
three-year
limitations
period
using
the
period
identified
by
the
wisconsin
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
that
entitles
a
plaintiff
to
wait
that
full
period.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that
is
correct,
but
the
use
of
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
to
deny
a
right
to
sue
before
the
expiration
of
the
full
limitations
period
cuts
off
the
ability
to
go
to
court.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
even
if
the
limitations
period
was
two
years,
i
mean,
the
wisconsin
court
in
this
case
saw
the
notice
of
claim
issue
as
being
dispositive.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
what
i
really
was
planning
to
address
was
the
way
in
which
the
short
notice
of
claim
requirement
placed
a
burden
on
plaintiffs
who
were
seeking
access
to
the
state
courts,
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
was,
i
was
going
to
analogize
to
this
court's
discussion
in
burnett
about
the
practicalities
of
litigation
and
the
difficulty
that
prospective
claimants
often
have.
they
often
aren't
aware
of
the
notice
of
claim
procedure.
they
are
not
aware
of
the
formality
of
the
procedure.
they
certainly
can
proceed
pro
se.
there
is
nothing
prohibiting
them
from
doing
that,
but
often
they
are
simply
unaware.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
that
argument
can
be
made,
but
it
has
never
been
accepted
with
the
breadth
that
your
question
suggests,
your
honor.
in
the
fela
cases
plaintiffs
have
been
permitted
to
go
to
state
court,
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
litigant--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--well,
we
certainly
don't
dispute
that
an
important
function
of
1983
was
to
create
access
to
federal
courts.
in
1971
section
1
of
the
act
had
a
jurisdictional
counterpart,
but
congress
wrote
in
broad
terms
and
established
a
remedy,
a
remedy
which
this
court
held
is
available
in
both
state
and
in
federal
courts.
i
would
just
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
fela
analog
and
say
that
in
fela
cases
this
court
has
rejected,
state
pleading
rules
that
were
burdensome.
this
court
has
rejected
state
standards
dealing
with
the
directed
verdict
standard.
this
court
has
rejected
state
policies
involving
the
burden
of
proof
on
releases.
there
have
been
a
number
of
decisions
in
this
court
in
fela
litigation
involving
what
could
be
characterized
as
procedural
aspects
of
state
law,
and--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--well,
i
can't
point
to
any
specific
intent
in
which
congress
said
state
courts
must
here
1983
cases
or
if
state
courts
do
hear
1983
cases
they
must
follow
these
procedures
or
those
procedures.
it
is
admittedly
a
very,
very
bare
statute,
and
yet
we
must
look
at
the
remedy
that
is
created
and
ask
whether
that
statute
should
mean
one
thing
in
state
court
and
another
thing
in
federal
court.
i
think
the
implication
of
the
wisconsin
decision
is
that
1983
will
mean
one
thing
in
the
state
courts
and
one
thing
in
the
federal
courts,
and
the
result
of
this
decision
is
that
in
wisconsin,
at
least,
when
litigants,
claimants
for
whatever
reason
do
not
comply
with
notice
of
claim
requirements,
they...
within
the
statutory
120-day
period,
they
will
simply
not
utilize
the
state
courts.
they
will
not
take
the
risk.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes,
four
to
three,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that's
right.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
so
did
the
four
lower
court
judges,
but
they--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--that
is
true,
but
we
clearly
did
lose
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court.
of
that
there
is
no
doubt.
in
addition
to
the
conflict
with
the
notice...
with
the
statute
of
limitations
principles,
it
is
our
position
that
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
constitutes
an
impermissible
exhaustion
requirement.
in
patsy
this
court
held
that
1983
cases
need
not
be
preceded
by
resort
to
administrative
remedies,
in
fact,
even
adequate
and
available
administrative
remedies.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
that
possibility
is
there.
the
question
that
would
raise,
of
course,
is
whether
they
could
properly
do
so.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
not
with
respect
to
1983
cases,
at
least
not
directly.
in
both
martinez
and
thiboutot
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
non-discrimination
principle
would
apply,
and
so
if
the
wisconsin
courts
entertained
the
same
type
of
claims
under
state
law
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
exclude
1983
cases,
no
squarer
holding--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--well,
that's
a
question
to
which
this
court
has
not
provided
a
great
deal
of
guidance.
in
testa
this
court
observed
that
the
rhode
island
courts
in
addition
to
entertaining
emergency
price
control
act
claims...
excuse
me,
refused
to
entertain
emergency
price
control
act
claims,
but
entertained
both
flsa
federal
claims
and
other
state
claims.
i
think
the
analogy
in
this
case
would
be
other
tort
actions
against,
or
tort
type
actions
against
local
governmental
defendants
or
entities,
claims
under
the
wisconsin
constitution.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--well,
the
non-discrimination
principle,
to
be
sure,
weights
the
balance
very
heavily
in
favor
of
state
courts
entertaining
cases,
and
i
think
that
is
how
it
should
be.
beyond
that,
there
is
support
for
even
the
more
difficult
issue
which
this
court
need
not
address,
but
at
least
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
white,
i
should
point
out
that
the
connecticut
courts
in
1912
refused
to
entertain
fela
cases.
they
disagreed
with
the
substantive
policies
involved
in
the
fela
legislation,
and
what
this
court
did
in
mondou,
the
second
employer
liability
act
case,
is,
they
classified
connecticut's
disagreement
with
federal
law
as
inadmissible,
and
the
court
stated
that
the
existence
of
the
jurisdiction
creates
an
implication
of
duty
to
exercise
it,
and
that
its
exercise
may
be
onerous
does
not
militate
against
that
implication.
we
read
cases
like
mondou
and
testa
as
not
simply
establishing
a
principle
of
non-discrimination.
states
are
under
an
obligation
that
goes
beyond
simply
refraining
from
discriminating
against
federal
causes
of
action,
but
those
issues--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
as
i
was
just
indicating,
the
issue,
the
ultimate
issue
of
the
obligation
of
state
courts
as
a
constitutional
matter
or
even
a
statutory
matter
to
entertain
federal
causes
of
action
in
general
or
1983
cases
in
particular
is
simply
not
involved
in
this
case,
because
the
wisconsin
courts
have
opened
their
doors
and
opened
them
widely,
not
as
widely
as
we
would
like,
as
this
case
illustrates,
but
they
have
entertained
1983
cases.
in
fact,
virtually
every
state
in
this
country
has
entertained
1983
cases
with
very,
very
minimal
guidance
from
this
court
in
terms
of
what
should
happen
when
a
1983
case
is
heard
in
the
state
courts.
this
court
has
spoken
to
state
court
1983
cases
on
a
few
occasions.
in
thiboutot
it
required
the
attorney
fee...
the
companion
attorney
fee
provision
to
apply.
in
martinez
versus
california
the
court
held
that
when
state
courts
entertained
1983
cases
they
were
obligated
to
apply
the
federal
immunity
standard,
so
we
have
some
minimal
guidance
which
supports
the
proposition
that
when
state
courts
entertain
1983
actions,
they
are
required
to
entertain
the
entire
cause
of
action
with
all
of
its
attributes.
one
of
the
attributes
of
1983
is
the
no
exhaustion
policy
that
was
established
in
patsy,
but
in
wisconsin
a
claimant
who
believes
they
have
a
1983
claim
and
wants
to
pursue
it
in
state
court
cannot
immediately
go
to
state
court.
they
have
to
go
to
city
hall,
and
then
they
have
to
wait
120
days,
and
they
have
to
do
that
in
all
cases
as
a
result
of
the
notice
of
claim
requirement,
so
the
immediate
access
to
a
judicial
forum
that
is
the
right
of
plaintiffs
is
1983
cases
is
not
available
in
wisconsin.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--i
would
say
the--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--no.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
there
may
be
other
rules
that
apply.
well,
the
exhaustion
requirement
to
be
sure.
if
the
state
had
a
policy--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--the
exhaustion
case--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--was
used
against
us
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
i
would...
other
rules
that
the
plaintiff
would
not
want
to
comply
with?
rules
limiting
the
availability
of
attorneys'
fees
and
not
applying
federal
standards.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
no,
no,
no
other
rules
in--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--well,
we
would
abide
by
all
the
rules
that
are
properly
applicable.
i
mean,
what
i
have
to
say
in
response
to
this,
justice
marshall--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--well,
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
did
comply
with
all
of
the
wisconsin
rules,
and
most
of
the
wisconsin
rules
that
could
be
classified
as
procedural
are
rules
that
govern
the
conduct
of
litigation,
that
govern
what
goes
on
once
a
plaintiff
files
a
case
in
court.
we
don't
argue
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
or
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
or
the
federal
standard
on
jury
unanimity
apply
in
the
state
courts.
those
are
rules,
policies
that
apply
to
litigation,
apply
once
the
case
is
filed,
and
are
uniquely
by
their
terms
applicable
in
federal
court.
they
regulate
essential
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
as
well.
what
the
wisconsin
notice
of
claim
requirement
does
is,
it
first
creates
a
condition
that
has
to
be
complied
with
before
one
goes
to
court.
secondly,
it
creates
a
special
set
of
protections
for
a
subclass
of
state
court
defendants.
notice
of
claim
requirements
do
not
apply
in
all
wisconsin
litigation.
they
apply
only
in
suits
against
governmental
employees
and
governmental
entities,
the
very
defendants
who
are
most
likely
to
be
defendants
in
1983
cases.
when
this
court
rejected
the
new
mexico
tort
claims
act
statute
of
limitations
in
wilson
versus
garcia
in
favor
of
the
general
limitations
period
for
personal
injury
actions,
it
pointed
out
that
the
use
of
the
general
limitations
period
would
prevent
states
from
discriminating
against
1983
claimants.
we
believe
that
the
notice
of
claim
requirement
places
a
burden
on
1983
claimants
that
cannot
be
justified.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
that
is
correct.
that
is
perfectly
appropriate.
congress
believes
that
the
absence
of
notice
of
claim
requirements
is
a
defect
in
1983
litigation
whether
filed
in
the
state
or
in
the
federal
courts.
congress
is
free
to
act,
and
we
would
think
that
that
is
where
the
proper
response
should
be.
notice
of
claim
requirements
are
very
complicated.
they
are
very
varied.
and
we
think
the
court
should
draw
a
clear
bright
line
and
simply
say
that
notice
of
claim
requirements
are
not
applicable
in
state
court
1983
litigation.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
thank
you.
we
don't
dispute
that
the
statute
may
work
very
well
in
wisconsin
in
the
traditional
tort
litigation
for
which
it
was
adopted.
in
cases
involving
potholes,
ice
on
the
sidewalk,
defective
highways,
the
statute
may
work
fine.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
no
experience
to
support
the
conclusion
that
it
works
fine
in
section
1983
cases
involving
allegations
of
constitutional
deprivations.
the
statute
is,
we
suggest,
not
a
simple
statute.
with
all
respect,
i
have
to
say
that
the
final
colloquy
between
counsel
and
the
court
demonstrates
many
of
the
complexities
of
the
statute.
and
this
is
a
statute
that
an
unrepresented
claimant
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
understand
and
comply
with.
i
think
it
flies
in
the
face
of
reality
to
conclude
that
it
is
a
simple
statute.
in
this
particular
case
the
plaintiff
was
put
on
notice
about
his
alleged
non-compliance
with
the
statute
after
his
litigation
was
filed.
at
that
time
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
file
a
notice
complying
with
the
second
part
of
the
requirement,
and
wait
120
days,
because
by
definition
that--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--i
didn't
try
the
case
below
but
the
formal
notification
of
the
statute
came
through
the
affirmative
defendant.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
it
had
been
on
the
books
since
1963
but
it
only
applied
to
tort
litigation
until
1977,
and
when
this
case
was
filed,
your
honor,
not
a
single
federal
or
state
court
in
this
country
had
ever
in
a
reported
decision
held
that
notice
of
claims
statutes
in
any
state
applied
to
1983
cases.
moreover,
the
federal
district
courts
in
wisconsin--
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
--that's
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
h.
steinglass
well,
what
i
have
is
that
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
robertson
versus
wegman,
in
which
the
court
indicated
that
the
issue
was
not
whether
a
particular
plaintiff
wins
or
loses
in
terms
of
determining
the
propriety
of
a
state
policy,
but
for
the
same
reasons
we
would
say
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
a
particular
plaintiff
might
or
might
not
have
been
able
to
comply
with
the
statute.
the
issue
is
the
appropriateness
of
the
requirement
in
1983
litigation
and
the
appropriateness
of
the
requirement
in
1983
litigation
not
only
in
the
wisconsin
courts
but
in
the
courts
throughout
the
country,
because
any
decision
that
this
court
makes
affirming
the
use
of
notice
of
claim
requirements
will
in
all
likelihood
be
a
binding
precedent
throughout
the
country.
thank
you
very
much.
