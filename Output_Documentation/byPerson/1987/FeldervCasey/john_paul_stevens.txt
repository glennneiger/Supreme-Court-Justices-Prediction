justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
i
guess
there
are
two
filings,
the
claim
itself
and
then
the
claim
for
damages.
if
the
claimant
asked
for
$10,000
in
the
notice,
does
that
place
a
limit
on
what
can
be
recovered
in
the
wisconsin
court?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
requirement?
justice
stevens
is
the
figure
admissible,
i
take
it...
sort
of
like
a
settlement
offer,
i
guess,
then.
is
the
figure
admissible
in
the
trial
later
on?
if
the
plaintiff
claims
more,
could
the
defendant
say,
all
you
claimed
in
your
notice
of
claim
was
a
smaller
amount?
justice
stevens
one
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
that
if
the
statute
only
applies
to
state
court
litigation
as
most
of
the
other
courts
seem
to
hold,
i
suppose
the
real
impact
is
that
you
would
just
channel
this
litigation
into
the
federal
courts.
justice
stevens
you've
got
to
do
something
within
120
days.
justice
stevens
and
a
lot
of
people
don't.
justice
stevens
let
me
modify
my
point.
it
is
at
least
true
that
any
plaintiff
who
sleeps
on
his
or
her
rights
for
120
days
would
have
to
go
into
federal
court.
justice
stevens
or
gives
actual
notice
and
shows
no
prejudice,
but
there
are
risks
not
to
go...
i
mean,
it
is
a
lot
safer
to
go
into
federal
court.
justice
stevens
the
action
notice
has
to
be
something
more
than
filing
a
complaint,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
of
course,
there
was
opportunity,
but
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
what
is
the
time
period
in
which
after
the
120,
initial
120
day
period
has
run
you
can
comply
with
the
statute
by
giving
actual
notice?
justice
stevens
so
you
are
telling
me
that
any
time
within
three
years
the
plaintiff
could
have
given
actual
notice
of
the
claim
and
then
filed
suit?
justice
stevens
if
that
is
true,
why
isn't
filing
the
complaint
adequate?
if
you
filed
a
complaint
within
three
years,
if
all
you
need
is
actual
notice,
how
can
you
better
describe...
give
actual
notice
than
say,
i
want
to
sue
you
because
this
incident
occurred
on
whatever
the
date
was,
and
i
got
hurt,
and
so
forth.
why
isn't
that
actual
notice?
justice
stevens
i
understand
all
that,
but
you
are
telling
me
that
actual
notice
within
three
years
is
all
they
have
to
do.
why
can't
they
then
dismiss
the
complaint
and
refile
it
the
next
day,
say,
i
gave
you
notice
yesterday?
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
are
correct
i
don't
understand
why
the
case
is
even
here.
or
even
why
you
have
a
statute.
and
you
are
playing
fast
and
lose
with
the
statute
anyway
by
allowing
actual
notice
instead
of
the
specific
kind
of
notice
that
is
required,
but
you
are
suddenly
going
to
stop
short
of
allowing
the
complaint
to
be
actual
notice.
that
seems
to
me
getting
perfinicky
at
a
very
late
date.
