mr.
grant
f.
langley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
did
not
lose
this
case
in
state
court
because
the
notice
of
claims
statute
at
issue
here
was
too
difficult,
too
complicated,
or
too
burdensome
for
him
to
comply
with.
petitioner
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
comply
either
before
or
after
the
city
raised
the
defense
in
this
case
of
failure
to
comply.
no
effort
whatsoever
was
made
to
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
under
our
notice
of
claims
statute
you
have
120
days
in
which
to
file
a
written
notice
with
the
city.
however,
if
you
fail
to
do
that
you
are
not
barred
in
bringing
your
action.
there
is
an
alternative,
actual
notice
and
prejudice.
once
we--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--the
state
court
found
that
there
was
neither
written
notice
within
120
days--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
or
actual
notice.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--nor
actual
notice.
however--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--what
i
was
saying
was,
we
raised
the
defense
of
failure
to
comply
with
this
provision
in
three
separate
answers.
he
had
his
first
complaint--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--no,
but
actual
notice--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--actual
notice
does
not
have
to
be
made
within
120
days.
actual
notice
can
be
made
at
any
time
during
the
overall
statute
of
limitations.
his
suit
was
filed
nine
months
after
the
incidents.
when
we
responded
to
that
suit
we
raised
this
issue.
he
had
well
over
two
years
to
provide
actual
notice
to
the
city.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
there
are
two
120-day
provisions.
the
first
is
with
respect
to
the
notice
of
claim.
the
second
is
with
respect
to
the
claim
itself.
you
must
file
a
claim,
the
second
provision,
again
at
any
time
within
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations,
but
once
you
file
your
claim,
unless
the
city
disallows
the
claim
by
formal
written
notice,
you
must
wait
120
days
to
bring
your
lawsuit.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
hasn't
answered
this
issue,
but
it
may
be
that
you
cannot
wait
more
than
two
years
and
eight
months
to
provide
that
claim
document
or
you
will
run
into
a
problem
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
that's
the
120-day
limitation
that
we
were
referring
to.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
but
the
intent
of
the
statute
is
to
give
the
municipality
an
opportunity
to
investigate,
and
if
appropriate,
to
resolve
an
issue
such
as
this
before
litigation.
if
we
permit
simply
compliance
with
the
statute
by
the
filing
of
a
lawsuit,
the
statute
itself
becomes
meaningless.
that's
the
concern
of
the
court,
and
that
was
the
concern
of
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
the
state's
interest
is
in
resolving
these
disputes
without
litigation.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
resolution
may
be
by
payment
of
the
claim,
by
settlement,
or
in
many
instances
by
denial
of
the
claim
and
because
of
the
reasons
for
denial
it
does
not
result
in
a
lawsuit.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
i
don't
believe
so
in
this
case
that
it
is
an
exhaustion
of
remedies,
because
all
the
claimant
is
required
to
do
is
to
file
a
document,
a
document.
the
claimant
doesn't
have
to
participate
in
the
process.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
that.
the
state's
interest
is
in
attempting
to
resolve
these
issues
short
of
litigation,
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
precludes
a
plaintiff
who
submits
that
document
from
bringing
the
lawsuit,
from
going
into
court.
i
agree
that
the
statute
says
that
after
you
file
a
claim
you
must
wait
120
days.
but
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
procedure
of
responding
to
that
claim
that
the
claimant
must
participate
in.
the
claimant
can
simply
ignore
the
process
after
that
and
file
a
lawsuit.
the
concern
again
of
the
court
in
this
case
was
that
there
was
no
attempt
to
comply
whatsoever.
the
reason
that
court
does
not
require
or
the
state
does
not
require
participation
in
the
process
is,
the
state
does
want
to
preserve
these
claims,
and
does
want
to
give
a
claimant
an
opportunity
to
go
into
court,
to
file
a
lawsuit
if
the
claimant
feels
that
that
is
the
only
appropriate
result,
but
in
many
claims,
in
many
instances
we
are
able
to
resolve
these
matters
short
of
litigation.
the
statute
works.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
this
case,
but
i
believe
it
does.
we
have
to
remember
that
as
part
of
this
statutory
scheme
there
is
an
indemnification
provision.
the
city
indemnifies
its
employees
for
acts
undertaken
in
the
scope
of
employment,
and
the
introductory
language
of
the
statute
talks
about
acts
done
in
official
capacity
or
in
the
course
of
their
agency
or
employment.
i
believe
under
those
circumstances
even
if
the
individual
is
sued
as
an
individual
and
not
in
scope
of
employment,
that
it
could
reasonably
be
argued
that
the
statute
still
applies.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
i
think...
first
of
all,
this
court
has
not
decided
that
issue.
secondly,
the
purposes
behind
the
statute
are
important
regardless
of
whether
the
litigation
is
brought
in
state
court
or
in
federal
court,
but
i
recognize
that
the
weight
of
authority
in
the
circuits
and
in
the
district
courts
is
that
it
does
not
apply,
it
does
not
apply
to
a
case
brought
in
federal
courts.
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
it
would
apply
to
pendent
state
claims.
i
point
out
here--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--there
is
in
my
judgment
in
reviewing
those
cases
very
little
analysis
of
why
that
is
the
answer.
however,
i
believe
that
the
purpose
or
the
reasoning
behind
the
court
is
really
the
application
of
the
1988
analysis.
they
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
gap
or
a
deficiency
in
the
federal
law
before
turning
to
state
law,
and
generally
the
courts
have
held
that
this
type
of
requirement
does
not
represent
a
gap
or
deficiency
in
the
federal
law,
and
therefore
they
do
not
need
to
consider
it.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
i'm
sorry.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
no
gap
where
the
only
issue
is
a
precondition
imposed
by
the
state
in
bringing
a
lawsuit.
here,
the
precondition
that
we
have
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
remedy
itself.
it
in
no
way
so
long
as
you
comply
with
the
statute
affects
the
remedy
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to.
therefore,
since
it
is
not
a
gap
in
the
federal
law,
it
is
not
essential
to
a
determination
of
the
federal
remedy,
the
federal
courts
have
held
that
they
don't
have
to
look
to
the
state
claims
procedure.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
the
other
way,
but
in
my
judgment
if
the
issue
were
presented
to
this
court
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
the
purpose
is,
if
a
claimant,
if
we
can
assume
that
a
claimant
acts
in
good
faith,
it
puts
the
city
on
notice
of
what
the
claimant
values
that
claim
at.
if
we,
in
terms
of
investigation,
determine
that
this
is
a
valid
claim
and
we
should
attempt
to
resolve
it,
the
claim
would
give
us
some
idea
of
what
the
claimant
is
seeking
in
terms
of
damages.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
however,
that
indicates
that
the
claimant
is
bound
by
that
figure.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
in
my
judgment
it
is
not.
in
my
judgment
the
only
way
that
the
city
can
react
to
that
is
to
make
an
offer.
i
don't
even
consider
the
claim
an
offer
to
the
city.
the
city
must
respond
with
an
offer,
and
under
the
statute
the
claimant
can
either
accept
that
offer
or
simply
wait
the
120
days
and
file
his
lawsuit.
it
is
not
an
offer.
it
is
not
a
matter
that
could
be
introduced
in
court.
it
is
a
document
that
simply
gives
the
city
the
opportunity
to,
one,
investigate
the
circumstances,
and
to
attempt
to
compromise.
i
would
also
point
out
that
there's
another
important
purpose
behind
this
statute,
and
it's
a
purpose
that's
consistent
with
1983
and
the
federal
law.
it
provides
us
with
an
opportunity
when
we
receive
notice
of
a
claim
such
as
this
to
investigate
and
to,
if
necessary,
take
remedial
action.
this
is
a
significant
public
benefit
to
the
statute.
we
may
determine
that
it's
appropriate
to
discipline
an
offer
involved.
it
may
be
appropriate
to
review
a
policy.
for
example,
if
a
case
involving
a
strip
search,
a
claim
were
filed
against
the
city
for
a
strip
search,
i
think
all
would
agree
that
there
is
nothing
more
degrading
than
a
person
who
is
subject
to
strip
search
by
police
officers.
in
a
case
such
as
that,
if
we
receive
a
claim
reasonably
shortly
after
the
incident
occurs,
it
gives
us
an
opportunity
to
review
the
policy.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
that's
correct
in
this
case,
but
the
overall
purpose
is
to
afford
the
city
an
opportunity
to
take
remedial
actions.
i
agree
with
you
that
in
terms
of
the
incident
we
had
knowledge
of
the
incident
very
shortly
after
it
occurred.
our
courts
said
that
knowledge
of
the
incident
simply
was
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
claim
statutes,
but
we
did
have
knowledge
of
the
incident
and
in
fact
we
did
conduct
a
full
investigation
of
the
incident
itself.
but
again
in
the
strip
search
example,
if
we
find
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
policy,
we
can
rewrite
policy.
if
we
find
that
it's
necessary
we
can
re-educate
our
police
officers
in
what
the
requirements
of
that
policy
are,
and
we
can
do
it
in
such
a
manner
that
others
may
not
suffer
the
same
alleged
injustice.
that
is
why
the
statute
is
so
important
to
municipalities,
not
only
to
resolve
the
claim
before
it,
but
also
to
take
remedial
action
so
that
this
type
of
incident
does
not
occur
again.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
i
don't
believe
that
that
will
occur.
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
comply
with
the
statute
is
minimal.
the
claimant
need
not
hire
an
attorney
in
order
to
comply
with
the
first
part
of
the
statute.
you
need
not
conduct
an
investigation.
you
need
not
prepare
pleadings.
you
don't
have
to
do
any
of
those
things
that--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--you
have
to
do
something
within
120
days--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--but
the
obligation
is
a
minimal
obligation.
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
a
three
sentence
document
that
would
have
complied
with
both
sections
of
the
claims
statutes.
i
should
point
out
that
the
issue
was
raised
with
respect
to
that
document.
the
document
isn't
directed
to
the
employees.
it
is
only
directed
to
the
municipality.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
either.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
it's
a
lot
safer
to
go
to
federal
court,
but
i
think
if
you,
in
looking
at
the
decisions
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
the
risks
in
providing
actual
notice
and
prejudice
are
minimal
at
best.
the
court
has
never
held--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--generally,
generally
counsel
comply
if
they
have
not
filed
the
notice
of
claim
documents.
they
will
comply
with
the
actual
notice
requirement
simply
by
filing
the
claim
documents
at
any
time
after
the
running
of
the
120
days.
in
each
and
every
instance
where
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
looked
at
the
claim
document
it
has
concluded
that
that
was
actual
notice,
and
in
every
instance
the
court
has
never
found
that
the
city
was
prejudiced
by
its
failure
to
get
the
notice
of
claim
within
120
days.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
again,
my
judgment
is--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--there
are
any
number
of
cases
where
the
claim
was
filed
after
120
days...
i'm
sorry,
not
a
1983
claim.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
you're
correct,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
what
happens
with
the
actual
notice
and
prejudice,
our
court
has
never
addressed
that
issue,
and
it
didn't
address
the
issue
in
this
case
because
it
found
that
there
was
no
attempt
at
compliance
whatsoever.
surprisingly
enough,
there
was
no
attempt
at
compliance
even
though
there
were
both
federal
1983
claims
and
state
claims.
there
were
state
claims
in
this
litigation,
and
yet
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
notice
of
claim
or
claim
provision.
we
don't
agree
that
this
is
an
immunity
case,
a
limitation
case,
or
an
exhaustion
case.
in
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
case,
you
generally
have
a
time
consuming
burden
and
potentially
expensive
burden
placed
on
a
claimant
before
that
claimant
goes
into
court.
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
or
the
claimant
in
this
case
is
minimal.
when
you
weigh
it
against
the
public
benefits
of
a
statute
such
as
this,
the
burden
is
minimal.
it
is
not
a
limitation
because
if
you
do
not
file
the
notice
of
claim
within
120
days
you
can
still
provide
actual
notice.
so
it
is
not
an
absolute
bar.
there
was
some
discussion
of
the
six-month
limitation,
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
six-month
limitation
runs
only
after
a
claim
has
been
filed
and
after
the
city
serves
notice
of
disallowance
of
the
claim
in
which
document
we
must
state
that
the
claimant
has
six
months
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
the
claimant
already
knows
of
the
claim.
we
have
taken
steps
to
disallow
the
claim.
we
provide
written
notice,
and
in
that
notice,
which
is
served
by
certified
mail,
we
must
advise
the
claimant
that
there
is
six
months
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
if
the
120-day
period
runs,
with
no
notice
of
disallowance,
that
six-month
limitation
does
not
apply.
it
only
applies
where
we
by
formal
action
disallow
the
claim
and
provide
notice
of
that
disallowance
to
the
claimant.
this
is
not
an
immunity
statute.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
afford
municipalities
an
opportunity
to
amicably
resolve
disputes
such
as
this
with
its
citizens
without
going
into
court.
that's
the
purpose
behind
the
statute,
to
give
us
an
opportunity
to
resolve
those
issues.
the
wisconsin
court
has
already
recognized
that
federal
law
governs
the
issue
of
immunity,
and
the
wisconsin
court
has
followed
this
court
in
terms
of
immunities.
we
have
a
$25,000
limitation
in
state
court
actions.
the
wisconsin
court
has
determined
that
that
does
not
apply
to
1983
claims.
the
wisconsin
court
has
already
determined
that
attorney's
fees
will
be
recoverable
in
1983
claims.
i
would
point
out
also
that
the
wisconsin
court
has
not
addressed
the
appropriateness
of
that
six-month
statute
of
limitations
that
i
just
referred
to.
the
court
hasn't
addressed
that
issue.
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
court
will
determine
that
six-month
limitation
on
a
claim
requiring
that
you
file
a
lawsuit
may
be
an
improper
burden,
may
be
an
immunity
that
the
court
will
not
apply
in
1983
litigation.
it
simply
hasn't
addressed
that
question.
it
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
statute,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
is
not
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
there
is
a
positive
obligation
placed
on
a
municipality
to
call
attention
to
the
statute
in
its
pleadings,
to
call
attention
to
the
failure
of
a
claimant
to
comply
with
the
statute
in
its
pleadings.
if
we
don't
do
that,
the
defense
is
waived,
and
that
is
true
both
with
respect
to
the
notice
of
claim
and
the
claim
provision.
we
have
the
obligation
to
raise
the
defense.
we
have
the
obligation
to
place
a
claimant
on
notice
that
this
statute
is
applicable
and
it
must
be
complied
with.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
again,
by
any
type
of
actual
notice
after
120
days
the
court
has
held
that
the
action
is
not
barred
so
long
as
the
claimant
can
show
that
the
municipality
is
not
prejudiced.
and
by
the
way,
i
would
suggest
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
indicated
that
the
requirement
that
a
claimant
show
no
prejudice
is
a
minimal
requirement,
a
minimal
requirement.
prejudice
generally
means
that
we
haven't
had
the
opportunity
to
investigate
the
claim.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
the
court
has
held
that
the
overall
statute
of
limitations
in
wisconsin
is
three
years.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
court
would
find
that
we
were
not
prejudiced,
and
that
had
he
made
that
minimal
effort--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--in
theory
i
agree
but
the
statute
says
that
a
claimant
can
neither
bring
nor
maintain
an
action
without
complying
with
the
statute.
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
statute--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--but
that
is
exactly
what
our
court
has
said
because
of
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
statute.
they
want
to
afford
municipalities
an
opportunity
to
address
these
matters
prior
to
litigation.
it
does
no
good
for
us
the
statute
would
be
virtually
worthless
if
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
order
to
comply
with
the--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--no.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
your
honor,
in
most
municipalities
these
claims
are
resolved
prior
to
litigation.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
there
are
very
few
claims
which
are
filed
with
the
city
which
ultimately
result
in
litigation.
the
statute
works.
it
works
very
well.
its
purposes
are
being
served
by
requiring
this
claim
prior
to
litigation.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
the
next
day
he
could
not
sue.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
he
would
have
to
also
comply
with
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
claim
provision.
that
second
part
of
the
statute
was
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
court
resolved
the
failure
to
comply
based
on
the
claimant's
failure
to
provide
notice
of
claim.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
i
cannot
agree
with
that.
i
can't
agree--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--but
the
claimant
also
must
show
if
he
is
going
to
rely
on
the
actual
notice
provision
that
the
municipality
was
not
prejudiced
in
so
doing.
again,
it
is
a
minimal
burden,
but
that
is
the
requirement.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
that's
correct.
he
must
take
the
additional
step
and
show
that
the
municipality
was
not
burdened.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
to
make
a
settlement.
that's
right.
once
the
claim
document
is
filed,
and
as
i
pointed
out
normally
if
the
120-day
time
period
is
missed,
the
claim
document
serves
as
both
actual
notice
and
claim,
and
he
must
then
wait
120
days
prior
to
filing
the
lawsuit.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
the
question
that
the
court
addresses--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--right.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
yes.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
the
question
that
the
court
will
look
at
is--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
he
simply--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--he
would
file
his
lawsuit
after--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--files
the
lawsuit.
we
raise--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--right.
and
then
files
the
lawsuit.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
no,
in
terms
of
the
first
statute,
the
first
section--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--the
notice
provision
is
the
first
section.
the
claim
provision
is
the
second.
if
he
has
given
us
actual
notice,
he
files
the
lawsuit,
we
raise
the
defense
that
we
were
prejudiced--
mr.
grant
f.
langley
--right.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
the
time
limit
that
he
has
to
wait
for
filing
the
lawsuit
does
not
apply
to
actual
notice.
it
applies
to
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
claim.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
assuming
that
he
has
complied
with
the
claim
statute,
he
can
file
the
lawsuit
immediately.
assuming
he
has
complied
with
the
second
section,
he
can
file
the
lawsuit
immediately.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
yes.
mr.
grant
f.
langley
he
has
not
done
that
in
this
case.
the
court
held
that
while
the
city
was
aware
that
there
was
an
incident,
we
were
not
aware
that
this
person
would
seek
as
a
result
of
the
facts
of
that
incident
to
recover
damages
against
the
city.
the
court
held
that
in
order
to
comply
with
the
actual
notice
requirement
you
must
advise
the
city,
the
common
council,
and
the
mayor
that
you
intend
to
seek
to
recover
damages
as
a
result
of
that
incident.
we
get
notices
of
this
type
of
incident
or
other
types
that
could
result
in
lawsuits
throughout
the
departments
of
the
city
that
the
common
council
and
the
mayor
never
become
aware
of,
so
they
can't
afford
themselves
of
the
benefits
of
the
statute
because
they
are
not
aware
that
these
incidents
occur.
in
fact,
in
this
case
there
is
a
footnote
regarding
comments
made
by
one
of
the
aldermen
who
received
a
call
about
this
incident
and
who
reported
it
to
the
chief
of
police.
he
indicated
that
he
didn't
feel
that
this
was
a
claim
or
a
notice
of
claim,
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
telephone
call
that
he
had
received
from
a
constituent
regarding
an
incident
that
he
wanted
the
department
to
look
into.
he
didn't
believe
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
statute
as
a
result
of
the
call
that
he
received.
again,
the
statute
is
somewhat
confusing
because
of
its
two
parts
and
the
time
frames
contained
in
the
two
parts,
but
it
has
served
its
purposes
well,
and
it
is
not,
and
i
repeat,
it
is
not
a
substantial
burden
placed
on
a
claimant.
compliance
is
minimal.
the
problem
that
the
claimant
had
in
this
case
was
simply
a
refusal
to
comply
with
the
statute
in
any
regard,
even
though
the
claimant
was
put
on
notice.
thank
you
very
much.
