--would
you
make
that
same
argument
if
they
had
been
defeated
and
were
no
longer
members
of
the

if
this
had
happened
25
years
ago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
case
defending
the

isn't
it
jurisdictional,
mr.
lee?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.

mean
may
we
not
so
respond
to
you?

jr.

noticed
the

j.
brennan,

thought
they
did
not.

i
right?
