mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
were
to
simply
hold
that
the
appellants
here
had
no
standing
to
appeal,
that
would
not
necessarily
result
in
the
vacation
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment;
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cantor.
