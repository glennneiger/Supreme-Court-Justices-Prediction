mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
questions.
the
first
concerns
the
article
3
standing
of
defendants
to
defend
against
constitutional
attack,
a
new
jersey
statute
which
permits
one
minute
of
silence
during
the
day,
during
which
they
may
engage
in
introspection
and
contemplation.
and
the
second
issue
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
on
the
merits.
our
basic
position
on
standing
is
that
we
meet
the
core
article
3
requirement.
that
requirement
as
has
been
stated
by
baker
v.
carr
is
such
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
as
to
assure
that
concrete
adverseness
which
sharpens
the
presentations
of
the
issues.
it
is
important
to
analyze
that
against
the
background
of
this
one
central
fact
in
this
case.
it
was
not
messrs.
karcher
and
orechio
that
invoked
the
federal
judicial
machinery
in
this
case.
it
is
the
appellees,
themselves,
the
very
ones
who
are
calling
standing
into
question
who
are
the
plaintiffs.
but
once
the
suit
was
brought
and
the
attorney
general
and
the
other
executive
officers
refused
to
defend
the
statute,
then
it
was
proper
for
messrs.
karcher
and
orechio
to
defend
the
statute
as
intervenors
in
defense
of
their
own
reputation
as
legislators.
that
is
what
they
do
for
a
living.
they
pass
legislation.
their
job
is
to
pass
good
legislation,
to
pass
responsible
legislation,
to
pass
constitutional
legislation.
and
their
reputational
stake
in
life
depends
on
their
ability
to
pass
such
legislation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
honestly
don't
know,
justice
blackmun
whether
it
is
or
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
in
new
jersey
or
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
did
intervene
in
their
official
capacity.
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
at
the
time
that
they
intervened,
they
did
hold
those
offices,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
do
not
at
the
present
time.
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
necessarily,
under
the
rules
apply...
do
not
apply
by
their
own
terms
to
legislative
officers.
those
officers...
those
rules
apply,
in
our
view,
to
executive
officers
who
do
have
ongoing
responsibilities
and,
therefore,
the
language
of
the
rules
substituting
one
for
the
other
makes
sense.
it
does
not
make
sense
in
the
context
of
legislators.
and,
in
any
event,
because
of
their
interest
as
legislators,
as
the
producers
of
this
legislative
product,
they
have
standing,
core
representational
standing,
reputational
standing
because
of
their
own
interest
in
their
own
reputation
for
their
ability
to
pass
legislation
and
have
it
upheld
as
constitutional.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
also
have
standing
in
their
own
respect.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
argument
might
be
slightly
less
strong,
but
i
guess,
yes,
justice
brennan,
i'd
make
the
same
argument
if
they
had
been
defeated.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
there
are...
there
comes
points
of
diminishing
returns.
when
the
nature
of
that
interest...
as
they
take
new
jobs,
then
they
are
no
longer
legislators.
then
they
do
something
else
for
a
living.
but
at
the
present
time,
that
is
what
they
do
for
a
living.
and,
certainly
that
is
what
they...
they
have
standing
in
that
respect.
you
have
to
bear
in
mind,
also,
that
there
is
a
difference
between,
we
submit,
the
standing...
standing
as
a
plaintiff
to
attack
constitutionality
in
the
first
place
and
standing
of
defendant.
the
major
standing
cases
that
have
raised
the
stringent
requirements,
valley
forge,
worth
v.
seldon,
flass
v.
cohen
and
so
forth,
have
all
been
plaintiff
standing
cases.
and
i
submit
that
cases
like
chathau,
and
united
states
v.
lovett,
and
bob
jones
v.
the
united
states
simply
fit
in
a
different
category
where
in
those
cases,
there
is
no
question
there
was
a
case
in
controversy,
whether
chathau
was
going
to
be
deported
depended
on
whether
that
statute
was
upheld
as
constitutional
or
not.
the
only
problem
was
that
like
here
there
was
no
party
to
take
the
adverse
side.
both
sides
took
the
same
position.
and,
as
a
consequence,
the
house
and
senate
were
permitted
to
intervene
and
take
the
same
side.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
there
was
not.
now,
there
are
differences...
excuse
me,
justice
scalia.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
question
calls
me
to
question
whether
my
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question
is
really
the
best
one
or
not.
once
they
are
no
longer
legislators...
i
think
i
would
like
to
withdraw
my
answer
to
that
question
and
say
that
once
they
are
no
longer
legislators,
or
once
they
are
no
longer
in
the
executive
branch,
then
they
do
not
have
that
concrete
stake
in
the
outcome.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right,
which
might
give
them
standing
because
of
their
personal
stake
in
the
outcome.
certainly,
as
concrete
a
stake
as
was
the
case
in
the
price
anderson
case
or
as
was
in
the
scrap
case.
in
the
bob
jones
case,
for
example,
there
was
nobody
on
opposite
sides
by
the
time
the
case
got
to
this
court.
and
this
court
simply
appointed
a
respected
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
to
represent
one
side.
now,
let
me
make
two
final
suggestions.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
that
is
correct.
the
narrow
question
that
she
asked
was
whether
the
rules
applied.
my
answer
was
that
in
our
view
it
applied.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
understand
the
extension
of
the
question
and
it
is
a
more
difficult,
it
is
a
more
difficult
question.
but
regardless,
you
still
have,
as
long
as
they
are
legislators,
their
concrete
interest
that
is
just
as
great
as
the
interest
of
some
that
have
been
sustained
by
this
court
when
you
had
plaintiff
standing,
not
defendant
standing,
but
plaintiff
standing
as
sustaining
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
sufficient.
now,
we
submit
two
final
things
for
your
consideration.
the
first
is
that
for
these
reasons,
that
is
enough.
and
if
it
is
enough...
if
it
has
been
enough
in
comparable
instances
for
plaintiffs,
it
ought
to
be
enough
here
under
these
circumstances
for
defendants.
but
that
under
any
circumstances,
the
ones
who
have
the
most
to
lose
from
a
ruling
on
justiciability
grounds,
the
arguments
that
the
plaintiffs
are
making
are
the
plaintiffs,
themselves.
because
it
has
been
very
clear
for
sometime
that
plaintiffs...
that
no...
that
no
harm
can
spawned,
no
legal
consequence
can
be
spawned
by
unreviewable
judgments.
what
we
now
have
is
two
judgments
of
two
federal
courts
that
have
been
spawned
because
of
these
defendants,
to
whose
standing
no
one
objected
at
any
time.
they
are
there.
they
are
judgments.
those
judgments
cannot
stand.
and
in
the
event
that
this
one
must
be
reversed,
then
clearly,
under
the
authorities
of
this
case,
what
must
happen
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
vacated
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
but
i
am
not
sure
it
solves
the
case,
either,
because
they
had
already
appealed
by
the
time
there
was
any
objection
made
to
their
being
here.
this
objection
was
not
made
until
one
month
after
the
jurisdictional
statement
had
been
filed.
and
you
would
still
end
up
with--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
that
event--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
i
think
you
can.
and
maybe
you
perhaps
have
an
obligation
to
do
so.
i
guess
my
real
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
that
would
be
a
complete
perversion
of
muncie
wier
principles
to
say
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
appeal
has
been
taken
by
one
or
by
another.
because
the
theory
of
muncie
wier
as
i
read
it
is
that
an
appeal
can
spawn
no
legal
consequences.
that
it
is
simply
unfair
to
say
to
the
plaintiff,
"well,
for
article
3
reasons,
you
cannot
go
ahead
with
your
appeal.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
assume
so.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
nevertheless,
the
same
principle
that
says
that
no
appeal
can
spawn
any
legal
consequences
applies
under
this
circumstances.
and
the
same
basic
underlying
principle
of
fairness.
the
final
of
my
two
points
is
this:
we
think
they
are
standing
here--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--absolutely
not.
that
is
not
what
i
am
saying.
i
sue
you;
you
win.
i
decide
not
to
appeal.
total
victory
for
you.
it
is
when
it
becomes
moot
or
for
some
article
3
or
other
reason
outside
my
control
the
judicial
system
is
unable
to
go
ahead
with
the
case
on
the
same
basis
that
it
did
below
that
the
muncie
wier
doctrine
comes
into
play.
and
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
did.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
messrs.
karcher
and
orechio.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
were
the
original
defendants.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me,
the
intervenor
defendants.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
as
legislators.
that
is
correct.
we
contend
that
they
are
still
entitled
to
maintain
their
position
as
the
parties
who
are
pursuing
this
lawsuit.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me.
not
as
legislators.
i
apologize.
i
misspoke.
they
have
been
replaced
as
speaker
of
the
house
and
president
of
the
senate.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
only
for
the
speaker
of
the
senate.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
now,
the
final
point
with
respect
to
standing
and
then
i
do
want
to
move
on
to
the
merits
is
that
assume
that
you
disagree
with
us.
and
it
is
a
close
question.
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
these
issues
of
great
national
moment
that
consume
for
people
like
my
client
enormous
amounts
of
resources.
and
that
consume
for
this
court
not
small
amounts
of
resources
being
decided
once
they
are
here.
i
say
that
without
derogating
in
any
way
the
principles
of
article
3,
but
that
if
there
is
a
way
to
decide
it
without
doing
any
violence
to
article
3,
once
the
case
is
here,
it
ought
to
be
done.
you
have
before
you
a
motion
to
put
on
our
side
of
the
case
the
same
kinds
of
parties
as
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
case.
two
parents
and
a
teacher.
and
i
would
suggest
as
a
possible
consideration
that
you
reconsider,
if
necessary,
the
motion
to
intervene
filed
by
those
people.
turning
to
the
merits,
there
is
an
interesting
parallel
in
this
case
between
one
aspect
of
wallace
v.
jaffree,
and
the
statute
here.
i
think
justice
stevens
particularly
will
remember
because
i
remember
with
great
discomfort
the
exchange
that
he
had
with
paul
battor
over
this
particular
statute
that
there
was
one
statute,
one
of
the
three
statutes
that
was
concededly
constitutional.
everyone
in
the
case
agreed
it
was
constitutional.
and,
indeed,
the
fact
that
everyone
agreed
that
it
was
constitutional
became
part
of
the
reason...
became
a
crucial
fact
in
the
decision
in
wallace
v.
jaffree.
this
statute
that
is
at
issue
today
is
identical,
identical
to
alabama
code
section
20...
16.1.20
that
everyone
agreed
was
constitutional
in
wallace
v.
jaffree.
that
alabama
statute
provides
for,
and
i
am
quoting:
"a
period
of
silence
not
to
exceed
one
minute
in
duration
which
shall
be
observed
for
meditation.
"
whereas,
the
present
statute
provides
for
a
one-minute
period
of
silence
to
be
used
so
at
the
discretion
of
the
individual
student
before
the
opening
exercises
of
each
day
for
quiet
and
private
contemplation
or
introspection.
there
is
not
a
nickel's
worth
of
difference
between
them.
excuse
me.
there
is.
there
is
one
difference
between
them
and
that
is
that
the
alabama
statute
is
mandatory.
the
moment
of
meditation
must
be
used
for
that
purpose,
whereas,
in
new
jersey
the
student
has
the
option
whether
to
use
his
or
her
60
seconds
for
introspection
or
contemplation.
the
three-part
lemon
test
squarely
vindicates
the
constitutionality
of
new
jersey's
moment
of
silence.
in
this
case,
there
are
two
purposes
and
the
major
focus
in
this
case,
as
in
wallace
v.
jaffree
is
on
purpose.
the
first
of
these
purposes,
the
case
for
the
first
of
these
purposes
can
be
very
simply
and
powerfully
stated.
and
it
is
as
follows:
there
is
a
legitimate
secular
pedological
purpose
for
a
moment
of
silence
at
the
beginning
of
each
day
and,
second,
the
statute
itself
says
that
that
objective,
legitimate
pedological
purpose
is
its
purpose.
and
that
objective
purpose
is
to
provide
for
a
moment
of
introspection
and
contemplation
at
the
beginning
of
the
day.
now,
under
lynch
v.
donnelly,
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry
because
lynch
makes
a
couple
of
things...
well,
cases
all
the
way
from
really
abington
through
mueller
make
it
quite
clear,
the
first
thing,
that
in
deciding
matters
of
purpose,
a
great
deal
of
deference
is
given
to
the
individual
legislature.
and,
second,
lynch
makes
it
clear
that
if
there
are
several
purposes
and
one
of
them
is
a
non-sham,
legitimate
purpose,
then
you
are
over
that
hurdle
and
you
go
on
to
effect
and
entanglement.
it
is
probably
best
stated
by
lynch
where
the
court
said
that
even
where
the
benefits
to
religion
were
substantial
we
saw
a
secular
purpose
and
no
conflict
with
the
establishment
of
cause.
how,
then,
could
the
district
court
possibly
hold
where
you
had
an
objective
purpose
stated
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
no
contrary
purpose
stated
on
the
face
of
the
statute
hold
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
he
did
so
by
saying
that
the
secular
purpose
was
a
pretext
and
that
it
was
really
just
a
pretext
for
bringing
prayer
back
to
the
schools.
he
did
so
by
relying
on
the
hearsay
statements
from
five
legislators
who
said
that
that
was
its
real
purpose,
even
though
other
legislators
said
that
the
statute
means
what
it
says.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
some
of
it
was
post-legislative,
justice
white.
actually,
most
of
the
post-legislative
related
to
other
matters
such
as
what
was--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
was
no
record,
there
was...
well,
the
best
that
you
had,
the
best
that
you
had
was
hearsay.
somebody
else
being
there
saying,
"yes,
i
was
there
and
i
heard
to
somebody
say
this.
"
that
is
the
best
that
you
had.
but
you
had
equally
good
stuff
on
the
other
side
for
other
people.
now,
this
experience,
the
district
court's
experience
with
this
kind,
with
this
kind
of
reliance
on,
quote,
v.
o'brien
and
other
cases
against
post-legislative
statements
and
hearsay
statements,
generally.
and
that
if
you
have
got
something
in
the
record,
you
ought
to
stick
to
what
is
in
the
record.
and
what
comes
from
the
court's
rule
in
this
case
is
a
mystery.
apparently,
it
would
allow
for
a
single
legislator
veto
so
that
if
i
were
one
who
disfavored
the
moment
of
silence
bill,
i
could
simply
say,
"i
favor
this
bill
and
the
reason
i
favor
it.
"
or
i
could
say
i
favor
it
or
not.
i
could
simply
say,
"i
think
that
what
this
is
going
to
do
is
bring
prayer
back
to
the
schools.
"
equally
outrageous
in
my
opinion
was
the
district
court's
consideration
of
expert
opinion
on
both
sides
of
the
fundamental
policy
issue,
whether
the
moment
of
silence
really
would
make
a
contribution
to
school
secular
purposes,
including
the
transition
time
from
a
pre-school
mindset
to
a
post-school
mindset.
it
is
no
surprise
that
school
people
were
willing
to
express
an
opinion
on
both
sides
of
that
issue
as
to
whether
you
really
would
get
a
quieting
down
effect
and
a
salutary
effect
from
that
kind
of
experience
or
not.
what
is
surprising
is
the
district
court
was
willing
to
listen
to
it.
public
policy
for
the
state
of
new
jersey,
including
school
policy,
is
set
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
and
if
that
legislature
determines,
in
its
wisdom,
that
the
boundary
between
what
happens
during
the
school
hours
and
what
happens
just
before
school
hours
may
be
marked
or
that
school
discipline
may
be
improved
by
having
a
moment
of
silence
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
day,
then
it
doesn't
matter
all
of
the
legislators...
excuse
me,
all
of
the
school
experts
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
think
about
that
issue.
their
opinions
on
that
issue
should
be
addressed
to
the
legislature,
itself,
and
not
to
a
federal
district
court
reviewing
for
a
constitutionality.
neither
lemon
v.
kurtzman
nor
any
other
case
has
ever
held
that
a
statute
filed,
the
establishment
clause...
held
a
statute
violate
of
the
establishment
clause
because
the
court
takes
a
different
view
from
that
of
the
legislature
as
to
whether
the
secular
objective
can
be
achieved.
the
second
purpose
that
is
established
by
this
statute
is
that
it
provides
an
accommodation
for
those
students
who
want
to
use
the
moment
of
silence
of
prayer.
now,
as
i
read
wallace
v.
jaffree,
under
wallace
v.
jaffree,
if
the
statute
provided
only
that
you
use
it
for
prayer,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
it
doesn't.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
my
opinion,
that
would
be
violative
of
the
statute,
justice
stevens.
it
is
completely
permissive...
much
of
the...
i
will
just
say
this
and
then
i
will
save
the
rest
of
the
time
for
my
rebuttal.
much
of
the
district
court's
difficulty
in
this
case
is
based
on
its
assumption
that
the
statute
is
mandatory
and
not
permissive.
and
they
are
just
plain
wrong.
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
in
that
respect.
it
is
mandatory
on
the
teacher.
the
teacher
has
to
permit
the
student,
but
the
student
can
use
it
for
whatever.
the
only
requirement
is
that
it
be
quiet.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
also
have
that
many
comments,
your
honor.
first,
with
regard
to
the
suggestion
that
the
case
for...
the
case
of
this
being
anything
other
than
just
a
newspaper
collection
of
clippings
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
the
moment
of
silence
was
in
support
of
prayer,
simply
cannot
withstand
the
record.
and
i
would
simply
invite
the
court's
attention
in
that
respect
to
two
things.
one
is
the
opinion,
itself,
which
it
is
very
apparent
that
that
is
all
that
they
did
was
just
go
through
and
quote
statements
from
people
who
had
been
there.
the
best
statement
in
the
whole
record
is
the
sentence
that
come
from
judge
becker
in
which
he
says:
"that
the
evidence
as
a
whole
is
equivocal
at
best.
"
"the
single
unambiguous
piece
of
evidence,
the
statute
on
its
face,
attests
the
secular
motives.
"
and
i
submit
that
under
this
court's
cases,
that
is
all
that
is
needed.
now,
second,
with
respect
to
accommodation.
the
only
way
that
can
sustain
the
proposition
that
the
difference
between
a
minute
and
an
hour
cuts
in
zorach's
favor
is
exactly
the
basis
that
was
just
stated.
and
that
is
if
you
say
that
the
only
possible
accommodation...
the
only
permissible
accommodation
doctrine
turns
on
the
removal
of
an
impediment,
but
that
simply...
doctrine
simply
far
outran
that
particular
notion.
cases
like
alan,
and
tilton
and
epperson,
i
think
have
to
be
explained
as
accommodation
cases
and
there
was
no
impediment
in
those
cases.
and,
indeed,
in
zorach,
itself,
you
could
say
that
there
was
an
accommodation
because
the
state
was
requiring
attendance
at
school.
but
that
really
falls
short,
because
those
students
could
have
attended
their
religious
instruction,
as
many
religious
students
do
throughout
the
country
today,
at
a
time
earlier
than
school.
zorach
v.
clauson
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
an
affirmance
of
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
karcher
v.
may.
and
the
two
differences
are:
the
one
minute
and
the
one
hour
and
the
difference
between
the
extent
to
which
you
bring
the
forces
of
the
school
into
play.
in
this
case,
there
are
only
60
seconds
of
the
school's
attention
time
that
were
used,
maybe
not
even
school
hour
time,
probably
school
hour
time;
whereas
in
zorach
v.
clauson,
it
was
a
full
hour
and
the...
in
zorach
v.
clauson--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
am
sorry.
i
missed
the
red
light.
i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
