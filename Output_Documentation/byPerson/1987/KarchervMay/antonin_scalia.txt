justice
antonin
scalia
i
presume
that
what
you
say
about
professional
politicians
who
have
chosen
to
be
professional
legislators
would
apply
to
professional
politicians
who
have
chosen
to
make
their
career
in
the
executive
branch.
so,
it
would
follow
that
if
we...
even
if
we
apply
our
federal
rule
that
requires
the
substitution
of
one
executive
officer
for
another,
a
former
executive
officer
who
disagrees
with
the
position
being
taken
by
the
then
current
executive
officer
would
continue
to
have
standing
to
participate
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
could
have
a
different
job
in
the
executive
branch.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
still
haven't
met
justice
o'connor's
point
that
even
if
you
assume
that
that
character
of
standing
is
adequate,
that
is
not
the
character
on
the
basis
of
which
these
particular
individuals
intervened.
they
didn't
purport
to
be
vindicating
their
integrity
as
legislators.
they
purported
to
be
there
in
a
representational
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
extend
the
question
beyond
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
how
that
works.
it
seems
to
me
that
whenever
you
lose
below...
well,
let's
see.
if
you
win
below
and
the
other
side
takes
an
appeal,
you
think
you
can
always
wash
out
the
whole
judgment
by
simply
saying
you
no
longer
have
any
interest
in
contesting
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
defense
of
it
any
more
important
than
the
execution
of
it?
i
mean
if
you
can
say
that,
you
know,
where
the
executive
declines
to
defend
it,
the
legislature
can
step
in
to
do
so.
why
can't
you
say
where
the
executive
declines
to
execute
it,
the
legislature
can
step
in
to
do
so.
this
doctrine
of
necessity
that
you
are
expounding.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
that
new
jersey
does
have
a
statute
that
allows
the
new
jersey
legislature
to
litigate
does
that
bind
us
as
to
whether
there
is
article
3
standing
on
the
part
of
a
legislature
to
litigate
concerning
the
lawfulness
of
a
statute
that
it
has
passed?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
held
that
a
legislature
has
standing
to
litigate
the
constitutionality
of
its
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
case
you
have.
well,
certainly,
there
is
something
to
be
said,
perhaps
not
in
a
strict
standing
sense,
for
a
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
goes
into
a
federal
district
court
and
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
to
have
that
case
defended
on
the
merits
rather
than
simply
have
it
go
by
a
default
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cantor,
if
you
are
right
that
there
was
standing,
originally,
for
this
case
to
be
decided
and
if
you
are
also
right
that
there
now
no
longer
is
standing,
why
shouldn't
we
dispose
of
this
case
the
way
we
would
dispose
of
a
case
that
originally
posed
a
controversy,
which
controversy
has
become
moot
while
it
is
on
appeal.
that
is
simply
remand
with
a
direction
to
vacate
the
judgment
below.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
controversy
between
whom?
not
a
controversy
between
the
parties.
a
case
becomes
moot
even
if
it
involves
a
very
sensitive
public
issue,
where
the
party
who
was
raising
that
public
issue
happens
to
have
died.
you
could
make
the
same
statement:
the
issue
is
still
a
very
important
one.
there
is
a
real
controversy.
unfortunately,
this
case
is
moot.
now,
why
isn't
that
the
situation
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
it
was
legislative
history?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cantor,
assuming
the
preponderance
of
legislative
history
that
you
referred
to,
is
there
anything
in
that
preponderance
of
legislative
history
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
this
was
being
done
by
the
new
jersey
legislature
as
an
accommodation
to
religious
practice?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
preponderance
of
the
legislative
history
would
contradict
the
assertion
that
this
was
being
done
in
order
to
accommodate
religious
practice?
or,
more
specifically,
how
do
you...
how
would
you
distinguish
this
proposal?
assuming
that
there
was
some
desire
to
make
things
easier
for
the
religiously
motivated,
predominantly
in
the
legislature's
mind.
assuming
that.
how
do
you
distinguish
this
from
what
we
have
upheld;
that
is
the
new
york
legislature
making
available
release
time
for
those
who
wished
to
do
so
to
go
to
religious
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
what
i
am
asking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
the
degree
of
impediment.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
the
degree
of
accommodation
was
greater.
i
mean,
if
anything,
here
is
the
state
taking
out
a
whole
hour
as
opposed
to
five
minutes
a
week.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
any
impediment
in
zorach
v.
clauson
to
go
to
sunday
school
on
sunday?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
second
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
goes
to
entanglement,
i
presume,
and
not
to
religious
motivation.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
meditate.
their
secular
alternative
is
to
think
about
ayn
rand
or,
you
know,
whatever
you
like.
