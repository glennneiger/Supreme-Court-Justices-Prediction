mr.
lee,
wasn't
it
reasonably
clear
from
the
record
that
mr.
karcher
and
mr.
orechio
appeared
in
their
official
capacity?
they
intervened
in
that
capacity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
no
longer
hold
the
offices
that
they
held
at
the
time
they
intervened
as
speaker
and
president,
respectively;
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
they
no
longer
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why,
under
our
federal
rules,
are
not
their
successors
automatically
substituted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
cantor,
under
new
jersey
law,
does
a
presiding
officer
of
a
house
and
the
legislature,
is
that
person
able
to
bind
the
entire
legislature
for
purposes
of
making
it
a
party
to
a
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
his
intervention
made
the
entire
legislative
body
that
he
represented
a
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
do
you
point
to
in
new
jersey
law
for
that
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
take
the
position
that
the
real
intervening
party
was,
in
effect,
the
whole
legislature?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cantor,
would
you
concede
that
if
all
we
had
before
us
was
the
language
and
text
of
the
statute
that
was
passed
that
it
would
survive
our
establishment
clause
tests?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
we
have
given
some
indication
that
it
is
risky
or
dangerous
to
try
to
prove
legislative
intent
by
the
use
of
statements
of
individual
legislators
in
the
course
of
passage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-1551,
karcher
versus
may
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
thrid
circuit.
the
former
presiding
officers
of
the
new
jersey
legislature
seek
to
appeal
a
judgment
declaring
unconstitutional
the
new
jersey
law
providing
for
a
minute
of
silence
in
the
public
schools
of
that
state.
we
do
not
reach
the
merits
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below
because
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
public
officials
who
have
participated
in
a
lawsuit
solely
in
their
official
capacities
may
not
appeal
an
adverse
judgment
after
they
have
left
office.
mr.
karcher
and
mr.
orechio
participated
in
the
judgment
below
only
in
their
official
capacities
as
the
presiding
officers
of
the
new
jersey
general
assembly
and
the
senate.
since
they
no
longer
hold
those
positions
and
since
the
incumbent
presiding
officers
have
withdrawn
the
legislature's
appeal,
mr.
karcher
and
mr.
orechio
may
not
pursue
this
appeal
in
their
capacities
as
presiding
officers.
they
have
never
participated
in
this
lawsuit
in
their
capacities
as
individual
legislators
or
as
representatives
of
the
expired
200th
new
jersey
legislature
which
enacted
the
provision.
for
that
reason,
we
hold
they
are
not,
in
those
capacities,
parties
entitled
to
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
because
we
have
no
proper
party
appellant
before
us,
we
dismiss
the
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
