mr.
norman
l.
cantor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
start
with
the
standing
issue
which
is
a
threshold
issue,
of
course,
in
this
case.
and
our
basic
position,
of
course,
is
that
the
real
party
in
interest
that
intervened
in
this
litigation
was
the
new
jersey
legislature.
and
the
representatives
of
that
legislature
have
now
determined
to
withdraw
the
appeal
leaving
this
court
with
no
jurisdiction--
i
note
that
mr.
lee,
if
i
understand
him
correctly,
has
abandoned
the
argument
originally
made
in
their
brief
that
mr.
karcher
was
in
as
an
individual
as
well
as
a
representative
of
the
legislature.
the
record
clearly
refutes
that
contention
of
the
brief.
as
i
understand
mr.
lee,
he
no
longer
insists
on
that
position.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
we
would
certainly
be
making
the
argument
that
if
his
sole
status
today
is
as
individual
legislator,
then
he
lacks--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--his
sole
status
in
this
litigation
is
as
a
representative
of
the
body.
and
he
is
not
allowed
to
switch
roles
in
mid-stream.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
this
court
said
so
in
bender
v.
williamsport.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
that
is
certainly
possible,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
that
is
certainly
possible,
your
honor.
you
passed
on...
the
court
passed
on
that
motion
quite
recently.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
there
was
a
motion
for
intervention
here
filed
by
mr.
lee
on
behalf
of
a
teacher
and
student
in
new
jersey.
and
that
motion
was
denied.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
the
present
leadership
of
the
new
jersey
legislature,
both
the
speaker
of
the
assembly
and
the
president
of
the
senate
have
notified
the
court
that
they
do
not
wish
to
prosecute
this
appeal
and
they
have
instructed
their
counsel
to
withdraw
the
appeal.
their
counsel
so
notified
the
court
in
april
of
1986
and
the
only
question
is
whether
mr.
karcher,
in
some
capacity,
is
allowed
to
pursue
the
appeal
despite
the
wishes
of
the
new
jersey
legislature.
now,
there
are
several
reasons
why
he,
as
an
individual,
cannot
pursue
the
appeal.
first
of
all,
because
a
collective
body
was
the
real
party
in
interest,
the
new
jersey
legislature,
it
is
clear
that
only
that
body,
itself,
or
a
representative
can
determine
whether
to
appeal
from
an
adverse
judgment.
that
is
the
lesson
of
bender
v.
williamsport
school
district
where
an
individual
member
of
the
school
board
attempted
to
bring
an
appeal
before
this
court
and
this
court
denied
standing
because
it
was
the
collective
school
board
which
was
deemed
to
be
the
party
in
interest.
we
have
a
very
similar
situation
with
regard
to
mr.
karcher's
current
effort
to
continue
this
litigation.
he
also,
we
would
contend,
lacks
article
3
standing
as
an
individual
legislator.
there
is
no
supreme
court
case
which
gives
standing
to
an
individual
legislator
to
contest
the
constitutionality
of
a
legislative
measure
unless
there
has
been
action
depriving
that
individual
of
an
actual
vote.
a
disenfranchisement
of
the
legislator.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
i
would
point
out
that
alan
karcher
intervened
in
this
very
action
through
that
very
device
and
the
appellants--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--there
is
no
question
that
that
was
the
understanding
of
everyone
involved
in
this
litigation,
including
the
district
court.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
okay.
well,
what...
what
the
intervenors,
what
mr.
karcher,
himself,
pointed
to
at
the
time
that
he
intervened
in
january
of
1983
was
both
the
rules
and
the
custom
of
the
new
jersey
legislature.
their
counsel,
mr.
marinari
stated
to
the
federal
district
court
as
the
presiding
officers
of
both
houses,
they
are
empowered
by
the
rules
of
both
houses
to
represent
the
house
in
litigation.
i
continue,
quote:
"it
is
the
presiding
officer
of
each
house
and
in
charge
of
all
administrative
duties
and
from
that
we
have
been
in
numerous
suites.
"
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
make
one
further
point
in
substantiation
of
their
contention
that
the
presiding
officer
can
bind
the
legislative
body.
and
that
is
we
checked
up
on
their
custom
claim.
and
we
discovered
that,
indeed,
they
had
intervened
in
other
legislation...
i'm
sorry,
in
other
litigation
through
the
action
of
the
presiding
officers
of
the
legislature.
we
cite
a
case
in
note
66
of
page
8
of
our
brief
which
provides
an
example
and
states
the
history
of
that
litigation.
and
it
was
mr.
karcher,
himself,
who
intervened
on
behalf
of
the
legislature
in
that
instance.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
they
intervened
after--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--they
made
a
motion
and
they
were
granted
intervenor
status
after
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
who
was
representing
the
commissioner
of
education,
determined
not
to
defend
the
statute
on
the
basis--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--he
determined
not
to
defend
the
statute,
but
the
statute
was
still
enforce.
we
still
had
a
litigation
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
the
original
suit
was
not
against
the
legislature.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
because
in
other
instances,
this
court
has
indicated,
such
as
in
diamond
v.
charles
where
the
illinois
legislature
was
present
to
defend
the
abortion
statute
even
though
they
were
not
originally
named.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
pardon?
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
they
were
not
originally
a
named
party.
i
believe
they
intervened.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
i
believe...
my
recollection,
your
honor,
is
that
the
state
of
illinois
was
not
a
party
and
intervened
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
this--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--i
don't
have
any
question
but
that
the
legislature
is
entitled
to
intervene
when
one
of
its
officers,
namely,
the
commissioner
of
education,
is
sued
as
a
party
defendant,
refuses
the
defend
the
state
enactment
and
the
enactment
is
there
without
any
defense,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--it
is
the
legislature,
itself--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--that
denominated
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
as
the
normal
party
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
its
enactment.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
the
party.
the
exclusive
party.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
that's
correct.
but,
just
as
the
legislature
designated
by
statute--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--i
would
think
so,
justice
marshall.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
the
legislature,
not
any
individual
legislator.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
when
the
legislative--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--i
don't
think
that
the
defense
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
legislative
measure
is
necessarily
exclusively
an
executive
act.
it
certainly
normally
is,
but
i
have
no...
we
had
no
quarrel,
the
district
court
had
no
quarrel
with
having
the
legislature
defend
its
statute.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
i
would
think
that
the
legislature
can
adopt
legislation
directing
the
attorney
general
to
prosecute
or
to
enforce
the
measure.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
i
don't
think
it
binds
this
court
necessarily,
but
i
think
if
the
legislature
designates
itself
as
having
a
sufficient
interest
either
in
its
own
capacity
or
as
a
representative
of
the
potential
beneficiaries
of
the
statute,
i
think
that
that
is
a
meaningful
interest.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
i
view
diamond
v.
charles
as
saying
that.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
has
been
a
claim
made
that
mr.
karcher
might
represent
the
200th
legislature
which
went
out
of
existence
three
and
one-half
years
ago.
and
i
simply
want
to
take
a
few
moments
to
dispel
that
notion.
first
of
all,
it
doesn't
conform
with
reality
that
he
indeed
represented
the
200th
legislature
as
opposed
to
the
new
jersey
legislature.
it
happened
to
be
the
200th
legislature
at
the
time
that
it
intervened,
but
that
was
not
noted
because,
of
course,
it
was
not
deemed
significant.
the
appeal
to
the
third
circuit
was
process
and
funded
by
the
201st
legislature.
and,
indeed,
now
time
has
gone
by
and
the
202nd
legislature
has
determined
not
to
appeal.
there
was
never
any
indication
that
mr.
karcher
was
exclusively
a
representative
of
the
200th
legislature.
it
also
does
not
conform
with
reason
to
suggest
that.
the
party
in
interest
in
the
defense
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
enactment
is
the
current
legislature
as
the
policy
maker
for
the
state
of
new
jersey,
the
shaper
of
the
state's
criminal
and
civil
codes.
that
is
the
message
of
diamond
v.
charles,
that
it
is
the
function
of
the
current
legislature
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
statute's
constitutionality
should
be
maintained
by
appeal
to
this
court.
the
illinois
legislature
determined
not
to
appeal
and
this
court
recognized
its
status
and
dismissed
the
appeal.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
i
don't
think
the
analogy
to
mootness
is
sound
at
all.
there
is
an
ongoing
and
very
live
controversy,
the
effect
of
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal
here
will
be
that
the
third
circuit
judgment
remains
very
much
in
force.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
because
the
dispute
is
not
moot.
when
a
party
determines
not
to
pursue
an
appeal
from
a
judgment,
that
does
not
render
the
prior
judgment
moot.
and
that
is
precisely
the
situation
here.
the
new
jersey
legislature
has
determined
to
acquiesce
in
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
they
determined
that
they
can
live
with
it.
they
can
take--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
diamond
v.
charles
indicates,
they
had
two
options.
they
could
have
chosen
the
repeal
of
the
statute
or
they
could
have
done
what
they
indeed
did
and
that
is
to
acquiesce
in
the
judgment
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
yes.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
you
are
correct,
justice
brennan.
i
will
make
one
last
point
on
the
issue
of
standing
and
it
is
simply
to
make
a
juris
prudential...
a
statement
of
constitutional
juris
prudence.
we
urge
the
court
not
to
reach
out
to
resolve
a
constitutional
issue
where
the
legislative
party
in
interest
has
determined
to
acquiesce
in
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision.
the
supreme
court
adjudication
of
a
constitutional
issue
is
a
precious
currency
which
ought
not
to
be
expended
except
where
resolution
of
a
constitutional
issue
is
necessary.
that
was
the
message
of
tva
v.
ashwander
ever
since
1937
and
justice
brandeis's
principles
of
the
avoidance
of
unnecessary
constitutional
adjudication.
counsel's
suggestion
that
standing
is
less
important
where
a
defendant
rather
than
a
plaintiff
is
involved
simply
ignores
cases
like
bender
v.
williamsport
school
district
and
diamond
v.
charles,
both
decided
in
1986.
i
will
turn
now
to
the
merits
of
the
dispute
and
to
the
determination
by
the
federal
district
court
of
new
jersey
and
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
new
jersey's
minute
of
silence
law,
[a10-64,]
violated
the
establishment
clause.
our
basic
contention
is
that
the
district
court's
approach
was
eminently
sound
and
that
its
conclusion
was
eminently
sound.
the
district
court
concluded
after
five
days
of
trial
and
scores
of
exhibits
that
the
actual
legislative
purpose
behind
[a10-64]
was
religious.
more
specifically,
a
purpose
to
reinject
prayer
into
the
schools
in
a
fashion
prohibited
by
supreme
court
precedent.
our
basic
contention
here
is
that
that
conclusion
is
amply
supported
in
the
record
and
deserves
to
be
upheld.
we
devote
considerable
attention
to
enumerating
the
reasons
for
that
claim
at
our
brief
at
pages
16
to
26
and
36
to
37.
i
would
simply
mention
that
there
were
numerous
elements
of
proof.
it
was
not
simply
isolated
statements
by
a
legislator.
there
were
in
the
legislative
history
a
very
clear
and
dominant
focus
on
the
issue
of
prayer
and
neglect
of
any
other--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--new
jersey
does
not
keep
a
record
of
either
the
committee
hearings
or
the
legislative
debates.
as
a
consequence,
we
were
forced
to
seek
various
indirect
means
of
showing
the
legislative
history.
we
did
present
witnesses...
eye
witnesses--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--that's
correct.
[laughter]
i
reiterate
that
there
are
a
variety
or
elements
of
proof
in
the
record
below,
including
the
dominant
focus
of
the
legislative
history,
including
statements
by
seven
legislators,
including
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
and
the
president
of
the
senate.
there
is
the
utter
refutation
of
the
sole
asserted
secular
purpose;
namely,
that
the
minute
of
silence
law
was
aimed
at
creating
a
calming
transition
period.
we
presented
numerous
elements
aimed
at
refuting
that
notion
and
in
federal
district
court,
after
hearing
our
proofs,
concluded
that
indeed
that
was
not
an
actual
purpose
of
the
new
jersey
legislation
and
indeed
that
asserted
secular
purpose
was
a
sham.
the
third
circuit
accepted
that
determination
and
i
think
the
record
stands
very
clearly
that
the
sole
asserted
secular
purpose
was
rejected
by
the
federal
district
court
as
a
sham,
a
conclusion
which
was
upheld
by
the
third
circuit.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
if
the
court
refused
to
look
at
all
beyond
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is
conceivable
to
me
that
the
measure
would
be
upheld.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
the
burden
of
demonstrating
an
illicit
collective
legislative
purpose
is
a
heavy
burden
and
a
hard
burden
to
satisfy.
nonetheless,
statements
by
legislators
are
one
of
the
elements
of
proof
of
collective
legislative
intent
and
that
is
exactly
the
way
those
statements
were
used
in
this
instance,
as
one
of
the
indicia
of
proof.
with
regard
to
your
comment
about
the
face
of
this
statute,
i
think
it
was
clear
from
the
record
at
the
time
that
the
federal
district
court
decided
to
delve
behind
the
face
of
the
statute
that
there
were
considerable
indicia
of
prayer
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
in
the
immediate
background
of
the
statute
which
warranted
that
inquiry
into
actual
legislative
purpose.
for
example,
there
was
the
term,
"contemplation",
which
as
the
record
demonstrates
has
a
certain
religious
connotation.
there
was
the
selection
of
the
first
minute
of
the
school
day,
a
format
which
mimicked
or
replicated
the
traditional
time
for
school
prayer.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
justice
stevens,
no
one
has
interpreted
the
statute
in
the
fashion
that
you
are
suggesting.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
the
district
court
specifically
asked
whether
or
not
that
was
a
plausible
reading
of
the
statute.
and
the
record
shows
that
no
one--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--right.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
all
i
can
tell
you,
justice
stevens,
is
that
every
administrator
and
every
party
associated
with
implementation
of
this
statute
interpreted
it
otherwise,
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
day
meant
as
part
of
the
opening
exercises
once
the
school
had
started.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
i
repeat
that
all
i
can
tell
you--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--they
are
the
people
who
were
charged
with
implementing
the
statute
and
they
were
giving
their
fair
interpretation
of
what
the
statute
intended.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
several
things,
i
think,
justice
scalia.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
okay,
i
will
turn
to
the
issue
of
accommodation,
since
you
raise
it.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
justice
scalia,
first
of
all
to
directly
answer
your
question
about
zorach
v.
clauson,
i
think
there
are
at
least
four
ways
in
which
zorach
v.
clauson
ought
to
be
distinguishable
from
the
instant
litigation.
first
of
all,
the
degree
of
impediment
to
the
religious
practice
was
considerably
greater
in
the
case
of
zorach
v.
clauson
than
it
is
in
the
instant
case.
that
is
they
were
talking
there
about
an
hour
of
released
time
during
the
week
as
opposed
to
one
minute
per
day.
that's
one
suggestion.
that
the
degree
of
impediment
to
the
religious
practice
was
different.
secondly,
there--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--one
of
our
theses
is
that
an
accommodation
of
a
religious
exercise
is
usually
appropriate
only
when
there
is
some
kind
of
impediment
to
the
religious
practice.
if
it
is
simply
a
facilitation
of
religious
practice
when
there
is
no
obstacle,
then
the
message
is
that
government
is
encouraging
and
endorsing
a
religious
practice.
therefore,
the
fact
that
one
hour
could
not
be
accommodated
within
the
school
context
makes
it
different
from
one
minute
which
we
claim
could
be
accommodated
without
any
special
kind
of
legislation.
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
numerous
opportunities
for
school
children
in
new
jersey
to
have
a
minute
of
silence
during
the
course
of
the
ongoing
school
day.
there
was
no
need,
therefore...
there
was
no
impediment
existing
which
would
warrant
a
pure
accommodation
measure.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
no,
but
that
was
the
whole
point.
why
was
there
an
accommodation
needed.
apparently,
school
children
thought
that
it
was
burdensome
to
have
to
take
the
hour
at
some
other
time.
it
is
certainly
not
burdensome
to
take
the
minute
in
some
other
context.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
the
second
difference
is
that
in
zorach
v.
clauson,
there
was
no
juxtaposition
between
public
school
classrooms
and
the
religious
exercise
while
here,
in
fact,
we
are
talking
about
a
religious
exercise
within
the
school
building,
within
the
classroom.
thirdly,
the
presence
of
extensive
regulations
on
the
part
of
the
state
commissioner
of
education
and
the
city,
board
of
education--
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
--it
goes
to
effects
more
than
to
purpose.
but
i
think
it
is
an
important
distinction
because
one
of
our
contentions
here
is
that
the
total
absence
of
any
kind
of
regulations,
any
kind
of
implementing
guidelines
meant
that
the
practice
would
inevitably
be
abused.
and,
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
a
meaningful
secular
alternative
was
provided
to
the
religious
exercise
in
zorach
v.
clauson
while
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
instance.
the
record
says
with
regard
to
zorach
that
those
not
released
stay
in
the
classrooms.
i
give
justice
douglas
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
i
assume
that
they
weren't
simply
warehoused
in
the
classrooms
and
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
secular
educational
activity
going
on.
one
of
our
contentions
here
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
conclude
that
even
under
an
accommodation
view
of
the
statute
as
judge
gibbons
took
in
the
third
circuit,
that
it
is
still
unconstitutional,
that
his
conclusion
was
correct,
because
there
were
no
secular
alternatives
provided
and
articulated
for
these
school
children,
these
impressionable
school
children.
they
were
told
that
we,
the
state
of
new
jersey,
are
preempting
the
normal
educational
program
in
order
to
permit
students
to
pray.
that
was
the
message.
mr.
norman
l.
cantor
what
they
were
told,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
is
an
opportunity
for
contemplation
or
introspection.
and
this
measure
was
applicable
from
kindergarten
through
12th
grade.
i
suggest
to
you
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute
to
tell
kindergarten
through
3rd
graders
that
they
have
an
option
of
contemplation
or
introspection
during
the
first
minute
of
the
school
day
is
to
tell
them
nothing.
the
only
message
that
they
understand
is
that
that
is
the
traditional
format
for
school
prayer.
they
don't
understand
what
contemplation
or
introspection
is
unless
there
are
guidelines
articulating
an
alternative
secular
function.
