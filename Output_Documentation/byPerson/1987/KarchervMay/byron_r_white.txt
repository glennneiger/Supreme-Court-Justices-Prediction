justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
if
your
clients
had
won
below
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
other
side
had
come
up
here,
and
then
it
was
decided
that
for
some
reason
that
these,
that
the
respondents
then,
if
they
didn't
want
to
defend
the
case,
the
court
would
have
appointed
somebody
to
defend
from
the
bottom
side.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
clients
were
the
appellants.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
was
no
record
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
that
the
intervenors
had
said
both
as
speakers
of
the
house
and
as
individual
legislators,
you
wouldn't
be
making...
you
still
would
be
making
the
argument
there
is
no
standing.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
don't...
i
suppose
we
have
authority
to
consider
him
as
an
individual
legislator,
whether
he
intervened
that
way
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
said
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
could
say
something
else,
too,
i
suppose
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
we
could
reconsider
the
motion
for
an
intervention
here
by
somebody
else,
too.
