justice
thurgood

they
were
the
original
defendants?
justice
thurgood

were
the
intervenor
defendants.
they
signed
the
notice
of
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
now,
they
have
been
replaced.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
only
claimed
that
for
the
speaker,
you
don't
claim
it
for
an
individual
member
of
the
house;
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
the
speaker
has
the
right
to
represent
the
legislature.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
legislature
wasn't
sued.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
did
they
get
right
to
intervene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
wasn't
against
the
legislature.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
how
come
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
be
represented?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
interested
in
your
belief.
i
am
interested
in
what
happened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
the
legislature
of
new
jersey
have
the
right
to
intervene
in
any
case
involving
a
statute
of
the
state
of
new
jersey?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
that
from?
a
statute
of
new
jersey?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--did
it
say
normal
party
or
did
it
say
"the"
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
it
didn't
say
anybody
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
suppose
that
somebody
attacks
the
income
tax
law
in
new
jersey
and
the
attorney
general
says,
"i'm
not
going
to
defend
it.
"
the
legislature
can
come
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
any
legislation?
wouldn't
that
upset
all
the
balance--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--that
makes
the
legislature
an
executive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happened
to
the
executive
part?
the
legislative
can
take
over
the
executive?
