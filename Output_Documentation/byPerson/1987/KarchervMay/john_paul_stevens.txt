justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr
lee,
can
i
ask
you
whether
you
think
it
would
violate
the
statute
for
the
teacher
during
this
minute
to
allow
some
students
to
pray
out
loud?
because
it
says
the
students
are
permitted
to
observe
a
one-minute
period
of
silence.
i
wonder
if
that
would
allow
some
to
be
silent
and
others
to
pray
out
loud.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
i
don't
think
that
is
quite
what
the
statute
says.
it
says,
"before
the
opening
exercises".
why
would
it
not
comply
with
a
statute
for
a
principal
to
say
that
school
exercises
shall
begin
at
9:00
a.m.
from
8
until
8:30
the
assembly
hall
will
be
open
and
any
student
who
wants
to
can
go
in
there
for
a
minute
for
silent
contemplation?
why
wouldn't
that
satisfy
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
are
being
asked
by
justice
o'connor
if
we
just
have
the
statute
and
nothing
else--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
that
is
what
i
am
saving.
if
i
just
have
the
statute
and
nothing
else,
what
i
suggest
would
be
clearly
in
compliance
with
the
statute;
wouldn't
it?
what
language
would
deny
the
principal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
doesn't
say
at
the
beginning.
it
says
before
the
beginning.
it
doesn't
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
day.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
they
based
their
interpretation
not
on
what
the
statute
says,
but
what
they
thought
it
meant?
