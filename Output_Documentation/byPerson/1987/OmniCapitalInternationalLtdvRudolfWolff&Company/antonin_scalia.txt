mr.

justice

if
the
congress
is
not
using
the
manner
of
service
as
a
shorthand
for
prescribing
what
the
reach
of
personal
jurisdiction
is,
then
why
is
it
that
when
the
manner
of
service
is
improper,
the
suit
is
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
isn't
that
what
happens?
is
it
dismissed
for
procedural--
justice
scalia
--that
is
not
a
jurisdictional
defect?
justice
scalia
well,
what
other
kinds
of
jurisdictions
are
there
other
than
jurisdiction
over
the
person
and
the
subject
matter?
justice
scalia
so,
you
are
saying
that
all
these
dismissals
because
of
improper
service
really
are
not
jurisdictional--
justice
scalia
--what
if
you
have
an
improper
service
of
process
and
the
point
is
not
noted
by
the
defendant,
the
case
goes
on
to
judgment
and
that
judgment
is
then
sued
on
somewhere
else.
justice
scalia
the
individual
never
appears.
justice

improper
service.
improper
service
and
the
individual
never
appears
and
judgment
is
entered
nonetheless?
justice
scalia
there
is
jurisdiction
over
the
person,
then,
right?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
waive
it
by
not
appearing?
justice
scalia
it
is
not
what
they
can
do,
it
is
what
they
choose
to
do.
the
chief
justice's
question
focuses
on
the
fact
that
rule
83
is
not
mandatory.
it
says
that
in
cases
not
provided
for
by
rule,
they
may
regulate
their
practice
in
any
manner
not
inconsistent
with
these
rules.
now,
it
wouldn't
be
inconsistent
to
assert
the
full
scope
of
jurisdiction
that
you
assert
exists,
but
it
also
would
not
be
inconsistent
to
assert
something
less
than
that.
so,
how
would
you
be
reversed
if
you
chose
to
exercise
less
than
that?
justice
scalia
so,
you
can
have
93
different
rules.
