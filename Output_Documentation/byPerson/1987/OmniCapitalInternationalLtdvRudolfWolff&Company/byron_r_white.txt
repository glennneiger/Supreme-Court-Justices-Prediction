justice
white
do
you
think
rule
4(e)
ever
applies
to
a
purely
federal
question
case?
justice
white
or
it
just
doesn't
apply
when
there
is
a
foreigner
involved?
justice
white
so,
in
a
purely
federal
question
case,
rule
4(e)
wouldn't
apply
at
all
if
the
question
is
the
amenability
of
the
defendant
to
service?
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
state
didn't
have
a
long
arm
statute
at
all
and
there
is
just
a
purely
federal
question
case
pending
in
a
federal
court?
justice
white
can
you
serve
at
all?
justice
white
if
a
state
doesn't
have
a
long
arm
statute
it
means
that
its
courts...
you
may
never
bring
in
a
non-resident
into
its
courts.
why
shouldn't
rule
4(e)
then
govern
that?
you
can't
bring
him
in
in
a
federal
court,
either.
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
state
says
that...
the
state
law
is
that
you
just
may
not
serve
this
person
at
all.
you
just
may
not
even
try
to
bring
him
in.
he
is
just
not
amenable
to
the
service
of
process
for
the
purposes
of
a
state
court
suit.
now,
why
shouldn't
the
federal
court
follow
that
under
4(e)?
justice
white
rule
4(e)
says
that
whenever
a
statute
of
the
united
states
or
an
order
of
the
court
provides
for
service
of
summons,
then
you
will
serve
the
summons
that
way.
what
is
the...
what
does
the
reference
to
an
order
of
the
court
mean?
justice
white
you
mean
a
federal
court
in
a
federal
question
case
could,
where
a
statute
does
not
provide
for
a
service,
just
enter
an
order
in
that
particular
case
providing
for
serving
of
process?
justice
white
well,
what
about
amenability?
justice
white
well,
could
an
order,
could
just...
i
just
don't
know
why
the
rule
has
a
reference
to
an
order
of
the
court.
justice
white
you
say
that
4(e)
just
deals
with
the
manner
of
service
of
process
and
never
in
any
action
doesn't
go
to
amenability
of
service
outside
the
state.
justice
white
and
so,
i
suppose
you
would
say
federal
district
court
could
by
rule
say
that
when
the
suits
are
against
non-residents
service
of
process
may
be
had
on
those
people
to
the
extent
the
fifth
amendment
will
allow.
justice
white
and
provide
the
method.
justice
white
and
without
having
to
worry
about
rule
4(e).
