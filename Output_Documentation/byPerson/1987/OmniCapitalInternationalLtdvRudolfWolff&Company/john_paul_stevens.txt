justice
stevens
well,
that
is
a
rather
extreme
position.
say
the
defendant
never
even
heard
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
stevens
well,
he
has
some
remedy
other
than
12(b)?
justice
stevens
well,
what
is
the
difference
if
you
have
never
heard
of
it
and
you
are
improperly
served?
what
is
the
distinction?
when
is
an
improper
service
waived
and
when
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
even
if
he
never
even
heard
of
the
fact
that
a
lawsuit
had
been
brought
against
him?
justice
stevens
how
could
he
waive?
justice
stevens
well,
he
hears
about
it
when
they
collect
on
the
judgment,
but
the
time
to
file
a
12(b)
motion
is
long
gone.
justice
stevens
do
you
have
any
cases
for
this
rather
novel
approach?
justice
stevens
mr.
paskoff,
before
you
get
into
your
legal
argument,
could
you
help
me
on
one
factual
matter?
justice
stevens
your
opponent
indicated
at
the
end
of
his
argument
something
i
hadn't
really
quite
understood.
that
the
london
parties
who
deny
personal...
who
claim
there
is
no
personal
jurisdiction
over
them,
were
subjected
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
of
the
court
while
it
was
a
securities
act
claim
and
then
they
subsequently
claim
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
i
had
thought
they
were
brought
in
as
third
parties
after
the
securities
act--
justice
stevens
--you
had
it
in
section
27.
justice
stevens
whether
your
contacts
with
the
whole
country
were
adequate.
justice
stevens
and
that
motion
was
never
decided.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
so,
then
your
client
was
before
the
court.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
had
lost
on
that
argument,
your
client
would
have
been
before
the
court?
justice
stevens
and,
of
course,
if
the
district
court
was
right
on
the
contacts
rule.
justice
stevens
what
if
the
district
judge
had
deferred
ruling
on
your
pre-emption
argument
or
the,
you
know,
that
there's
no
securities
act
claim
here,
until
the
end
of
the
plaintiffs'
case,
something
like
that.
and
then
they
had
said,
"well,
i
was
wrong.
"
"i
never
should
have
gone
to
trial
on
the
securities
act
because
there
is
just
no...
it
has
been
preempted
by
the
commodities
exchange
act.
"
would
you
still
be
able
to
get
out
on
your
present
jurisdictional
theory,
do
you
think?
justice
stevens
after
the
case
is
half
tried?
justice
stevens
what
if
instead
of
the
preempt,
the
argument
that
the
commodities
act
superceded
the
other,
you
had
simply
persuaded
the
district
judge
that
it
didn't
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
securities
act
and,
yet,
you
were
properly
before...
if
you
were
before
the
court
on
the
securities
act,
i
presume
they
also
could
have
tried
the
commodities
exchange
claim
at
the
same
time.
couldn't
they?
you
can't
have
a
pending
jurisdiction
motion.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
i
understand.
but
at
least
that
he
had
the
right
to
bring
you
before
the
court
and
require
you
to
make
that
argument
to
the
court
and
demonstrate
that
there
really
is
no
valid
claim
under
the
securities
act.
justice
stevens
so,
you
were,
for
a
brief
period
of
time
at
least,
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
louisiana
court.
it's
a
kind
of
a
puzzle.
i
don't
know
what...
they
haven't
really
argued
this,
but
i
have
to
confess
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
you
don't
really
want
to
give
that
pendant
jurisdiction
necessarily
applies
to
jurisdiction
over
the
person
as
well
as
it
applies
to
jurisdiction
over
subject
matter?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
would
also
demonstrate
that
congress
didn't
intend
any
cause
of
action
to
be
implied.
