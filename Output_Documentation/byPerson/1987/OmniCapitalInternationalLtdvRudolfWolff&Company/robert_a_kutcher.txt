mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
addresses
squarely
the
question
of
whether
in
a
purely
federal
question
case
arising
under
the
commodities
act
against
foreign
nationals
a
federal
court
is
bound
by
the
state
long
arm
statute
in
which
it
sits
in
determining
whether
the
foreign
national
is
subject
to
personal
jurisdiction.
ancillary
to
that
issue
is
the
question
of
whether
in
a
private
commodities
claim
there
exists
the
same
nationwide
service
standard
as
that
found
in
other
provisions
of
the
commodities
act.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
they
do
not
need
to
be
repeated.
i
do
want
to
point
out,
however,
to
the
court
that
this
is
one
of
the
so-called
"silver
straddle"
cases
which
was
argued
in
front
of
the
tax
court.
the
silver
straddle
cases
involved
over
1400
united
states
taxpayers
who,
through
trading
in
silver
straddles,
were
attempting
to
shelter
over
$100
million.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
among
those
investors,
rudolf
wolff
&
company
and
james
gourlay
were
among
the
london
brokers
who
effected
some
of
the
trades.
accordingly,
there
was
a
substantial
participation
by
not
only
among
these
petitioners
but
about
1400
united
states
taxpayers,
all
involved
in
the
same
transactions.
the
facts
of
the
case
present
the
court
with
clear
alternatives.
under
the
louisiana
long
arm
statute,
we
have
conceded
that
there
are
insufficient
contacts
to
maintain
this
commodities
fraud
suit
against
rudolf
wolff
&
company
and
james
gourlay,
one
of
whom
is
a
british
corporation,
the
other
is
a
national
of
the
united
kingdom.
however,
it
has
also
been
determined
that
if
one
aggregates
their
contacts
not
only
with
the
state
of
louisiana,
but
throughout
the
united
states,
then
there
are
sufficient
contacts
to
subject
them
to
suit
under
the
commodities
act.
the
question
which
is
presented
here
is
what
standard
should
this
court
apply.
in
essence,
your
honors,
this
case
comes
down
to
the
application
of
federal
rule
civil
procedure
4(e)
and
whether
that
procedural
rule
imposes
a
substantive
standard
on
personal
jurisdiction.
we
submit
that
it
does
not
and,
as
judge
wisdom
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
rule
4
is
nothing
more
than
a
procedural
rule
designed
for
efficient
housekeeping
of
the
federal
courts.
it
was
never
intended
nor
should
it
be
construed
to
impose
substantive
standards
of
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
justice
white,
rule
4(e)
applies--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--well,
rule
4(e)
applies
for
the
purpose
of
the
physical
means
of
effecting
service
of
process,
not
the
amenability
of
the
individual
to
the
court's
law.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
has
to
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
argument
and
i
think...
and
i
think
your
opinion,
your
honor,
in
insurance
corporation
of
ireland
properly
points
out
that
the
source
for
personal
jurisdiction
comes
from
the
fifth
amendment,
comes
from
the
due
process
clause,
and
4(e),
we
submit
is
nothing
more
than
the
procedural
means,
the
second
half
of
determining
whether
or
not
you
have
got
personal
jurisdiction,
but
it
doesn't
effect
the
amenability.
this
case
involves
foreign
nationals
and
i
certainly
make
the
argument--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
that
if
the
state
does
not
have
a
long
arm
statute
then
what
you
are
faced
with
is
whether
or
not
it
comports
with
the
due
process
clause.
and,
as
you
pointed
out,
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause
is
the
basis
for
personal
jurisdiction.
so,
yes,
sir,
i
think
you
can.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
can...
the
manner
in
which
you
physically
effect
that
service
i
think,
as
judge
wisdom
said
in
his
dissent,
is
something
that
can
be
fashioned
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
you
do
not
need
to
have
a
specific
provision
in
4(e)
to
determine
all
methods
of
service
of
process,
because
rule
82
and
83
permit
the
courts
to
fashion
rules
which
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rules.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
justice
o'connor,
a
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
you
are
correct.
and
that
is
the
conclusion
of
our
theory
that
the
courts...
the
federal
courts,
the
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction,
that
is
that
congress
will
only
create
those
statutes
and
you
do
not
have
the
authority
to
hear
that
case.
but
with
respect
to
personal
jurisdiction,
with
whether
or
not
you
can
bring
somebody
in
to
hear
a
case,
that
comes
either
from
the
fifth
amendment
insofar
as
federal
question
cases--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--yes,
ma'am.
i
can't
do
anything
about
that.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
our
argument
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
there
be
due
process
in
bringing
someone
into
a
court.
that
is
whether--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--yes,
sir.
i
do.
i
do,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
and
i
can't
argue
that
point
with
you,
either.
our
position
is
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth...
if
there
were
no,
as
justice
white
asked
me:
if
there
were
no
state
long
arm
statute,
i
think
that
a
state
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
not
under
the
fifth
amendment,
can
bring
someone
in,
determine
personal
jurisdiction
based
on
the
limits
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
fact,
as
the
court
knows
there
are
some
state
statutes
which
simply
say
if
it
is
okay
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
can
do
it.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
well,
that
relates
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not...
the
distinction
that
i'm
making,
justice
white,
is
the
distinction
between
the
amenability
to
jurisdiction
and
the
physical
means
of
service
of
process.
and
i
think
you
can't
bring
them
in
based
on--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--because
this
is
a
federal
question
case
and
the
authorities
and
the
authority
under
which
a
federal
court
is
acting
in
a
federal
question
case
stems
from
the
commodities
exchange
act
and
not
from
state
action.
and
that
is
precisely
the
argument
that
we
are
making:
that
in
this
particular
instance
the
authority
under
which
the
court
is
acting
has
no
relationship
to
what
jurisdiction
or
what
state
the
district
court
is
sitting
in.
to
do
otherwise
would
permit
a
disparity
in
treatment,
depending
on
a
state's
long
arm
statute.
to
do
otherwise
would
permit
a
foreign
national
who,
as
in
this
case,
has
been
found
to
have
adequate
contacts
throughout
the
united
states,
but
insufficient
contacts
in
any
one
state
to
avoid
ever
having
to
answer
on
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
any
commodities
fraud
was
committed
or
not
committed.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--insofar
as
a
claim
against
foreign
nationals
is
concerned,
i
think
that
the
standard
is--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--insofar
as
claims
against
foreign
nationals
are
concerned
because
the
source
of
the
authority
comes
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
well,
i
think
it
comes
from
whether
or
not
it
meets
the
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
justice
that
this
court
has
adopted
over
the
past
50
years.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
don't
think
you
have
to
make
that
presumption,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
the
due
process
clause
on
its
own
permits
you
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
meet
the
standards
of
traditional
justice
and
fair
play.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
that
under,
i
think
that
under
4(e)
as
was
argued
by
judge
wisdom
in
the
dissent
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
congress
in
a
case...
in
the
case
of
this
nature
involving
what
has
been
in
the
legislative
history
deemed
to
be
something
of
significant
importance
to
the
enforcement
of
commodities
actions
would
permit
the
extension
of
a
nationwide
service
of
process.
now,
that
i
will
address
a
little
bit
later
if
the
court
doesn't
mind
regarding
the
application
in
commodities
act,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
origin
of
the
way
the
commodities
act
was
originated
and
the
history
revolving
around
the
commodities
act
that
it
is
clear
that
a
commodities
action
was
designed
to
prohibit
the
very
same
abuses
which
the
securities
laws
50
years
earlier
were
designed
to
prohibit.
and,
under
those
circumstances,
we
submit
that
there
should
certainly
with
regard
to
commodities
actions
be
a
nationwide
service
standard
for
service
of
process.
yes,
sir?
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
it
refers
to
local
rules
or
to
rules
which
the
courts--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--to
effect
the
physical
means
of
notifying
a
defendant
of
the
pendency
of
an
action
in
a
jurisdiction.
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
petro
shipping
case.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
on
amenability,
it
comes
down
to
the
standard
of
whether
or
not
you
meet
the
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
well,
it
seems...
my
interpretation
of
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
authorizes
and
incorporates
rule
83
where
the
court
has
the
authority
to
enter
rules
as
long
as
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
that
is
how
i
interpret
that
particular
provision.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
another
alternative
that
could
apply.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
the
suit
is
dismissed
for
insufficiency
of
service
of
process.
and
the
process
is
fair--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--it
is
not
a
personal
jurisdictional
defect,
no,
sir.
i
think
it
is
dismissed
for
insufficiency
of
service
of
process.
and
i
think
if
you
can
properly--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--that's
it.
but
what
i
am
suggesting--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--they
are
not
necessarily.
i
think
that
they
are
separately
addressed
under
rule
12(b).
you
can
bring
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
a
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction
or
you
can
bring
a
motion
for
insufficiency
of
service
or
insufficiency
of
process.
so,
the
federal
rules
contemplate
a
distinction
between
personal
jurisdiction
and
service
of
process.
and
i
think
what
has
happened...
and
i
can't
argue
with
justice
o'connor
that
the
courts
have
done
this...
is
somehow
they
have
adopted
a
substantive
constitutional
basis
and
incorporated
that
into
the
procedure
of
rule
4
for
obtaining
service
of
process.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
that's
waived.
as
i
appreciate
12(b)
the
only
thing
that
you
can't
waive
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
you
can
waive
personal
jurisdiction
and
you
can
waive
the
service
of
process,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that,
as
in
this
case,
if
you
don't
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
for--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--and
if
you've
got
good
service
and
the
individual
never
appears
and
the
default
is
taken,
i
don't
think
you
can
collaterally--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--as
i
appreciate
it,
you
would
have
to
come
back
and
argue
the
same
way
you
would
in
any
other
default.
the
service...
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
service
is
waived
if
it
is
not
asserted
under
rule
12(b).
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
so.
it's
waived.
it's...
there--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--well,
the
same
way
that
you
would
if
you
don't
assert
it,
you
waive
it.
and
if
you
appear,
judge.
justice.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--well,
then
he
has
got
the
same
remedies
available
to
him--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
an
improper
service
is
waived
if...
i
think
an
improper
service
such
as
would
be
dismissable
under
rule
12(b)
would
be
waived
in
any
instance
that
any
other
12(b)
motion
would
be
waived.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
well,
if
he
never
heard
of
it--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--then
i
assume,
then
i
would
assume
that
when
they
went
to
try
to
collect
on
the
judgment
he
would
have
remedies
available
to
him.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
that
is
something
that
is
addressed,
frankly,
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was...
whether
he
should
have
known
about
it
or
not.
but
that
really--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--no,
sir,
because
i
didn't
plan
on
getting
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
default
was
taken.
i
think
we
are
taking
the
position
that
under
the...
that
rule
4
simply
prescribes
the
method
by
which
you
physically
notify
someone
of
a
suit.
rule
4,
by
its
own
language,
says
service
may
be
made
under
the
circumstances
which
we
argue
and
which
judge
wisdom
and
five
other
circuit
court
judges
in
the
fifth
circuit,
viewed
to
be
discretionary,
not
the
mandatory
method
of
if
you
can't
do
it
this
way,
you
can't
do
it
at
all,
but
simply,
you
can
another
route.
and
the
whole
basis
should
be
whether
or
not
the
presence
of
the
defendant
in
the
federal
court
is
such
that
it
does
not
offend
the
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
as
i
understand
it
it
deals
with--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--yes,
sir.
as
i
appreciate
it
and
again
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
and
as
was
determined
in
the
petro
shipping
case
which
is
cited
in
judge
wisdom's
dissent
that
the
court
has
the...
the
federal
district
court
has
the
authority
to
effect
a
method
by
which
service
is
obtained.
and
what
we
are
submitting--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
absolutely.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
oh,
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
federal
question
cases,
which
the
commodities
act
certainly
is,
and
certainly
in
cases
involving
foreign
nationals.
and,
if
you
look
at
the
national
contacts
cases
which
have
been
decided,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
they
all
talk
about...
one
of
the
factors
that
we--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
the
authority
is
such
that--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--i
think
that
the
argument
that
we
are
asserting,
chief
justice,
is
that
under
the...
that
the
federal
rules
should
not
substantively
effect
the
rights
of
a
plaintiff
to
maintain
an
action
against
a
foreign
national.
judge
wisdom
analogized
the
state
long
arm
statute
to
the
national
contacts
theory
in
cases
involving
foreign
nationals.
and
i
think
that
is
a
pretty
fair
analogy.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
well,
i
think
that
83
just
permits
you
to
fashion...
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
have
93
different
rules.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
as
long
as
the
rule
is
in
compliance--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--with
the
limits
of
what
is
permitted
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
well,
every
district
has,
i
think...
i
think
the
federal
courts
have
that
authority.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
chief
justice,
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of
appellate
review.
i
can't
answer
your
question
specifically
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
likelihood,
frankly,
of
93
different
opinions
as
to
what
they
can
do
or
what
a
district
court
judge
can
do--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--in
thinking
about
it,
i
think,
as
mr.
lee
did
this
morning,
i
think
that
i
have
got
to
change
my
response
and
say
that
as
long
as
it
is
constitutional
a
district
court
judge
can
do
anything
which
is
permitted
under
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--theoretically,
you
can
have
93
different
rules.
i
think...
but
the
venue
provisions
which
are
going
to
limit
where
you
can
maintain
an
action
regardless
of
personal
jurisdiction
are
going
to
have
an
effect
here
as
well.
and
that
is
something
that
i
think
needs
to
be
addressed.
as
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
in
several
cases,
the
federal
courts
have
never
had
to
fashion
a
personal
jurisdiction
basis
because
your
strict
venue
requirements
dictate
that
you
can
either
bring
your
action
where
the
plaintiffs
reside
or
the
cause
of
action
arose
where
the
defendants
reside,
depending
on
whether
or
not
you
have
got
diversity
of
federal
question
jurisdiction.
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
limitation,
if
you
will,
on
the
power
of
a
federal
district
court
stems
from
the
venue
provisions
and
not
from
the
personal
jurisdiction
basis.
and
that
is
the
argument
which
we
are
asserting:
that
venue
is
what
is
going
to
limit
the
hailing
of
a
foreign
national,
such
as
rudolf
wolff
&
company,
into
a
court
where
there
wouldn't...
where
the
court
may
have
the
personal
jurisdiction
and
it
may
be
constitutional
and
it
may
meet
traditional
notions
of
fair
play,
but
it
simply
is
not
the
proper
venue.
and
you
have
got
to
shop
elsewhere.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
i
think
that,
yes,
sir.
that's
my
argument
and
1
think
that
in
federal--
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
--and
i
think...
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
and
provide
the
method.
and
i
think
that
is
accurate.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
that's
exactly
right.
and
that's
the
national
contacts
theory.
you
look
to
the
basis
of
the
foreign
nationals
contacts
with
the
entire
united
states.
and
this
court
has
held
in
at
least
one
case
that
in
terms
of
foreign
relations
that
this
is
one
country.
it
is
not
50
separate
states.
it
is
not
50
separate
autonomous
units.
it
is
one
country
with
regard
to
foreign
nationals.
i
think
that
standard
applies.
and
i
think
it
particularly
applies
in
a
case
of
this
nature
in
an
action
which
is
a
commodities
fraud
case
which
was
initially
filed
as
a
securities
fraud
claim.
the
irony
is
that
this
lawsuit
when
it
was
initially
filed,
was
filed
as
a
securities
fraud
claim.
no
dispute
that
section
27
permits
nationwide
service
of
process.
subsequently,
the
case
is
amended
to
include
a
commodities
fraud
claim,
then
it
is
determined
that
the
commodities
remedy
is
the
exclusive
remedy.
and,
now,
all
of
a
sudden,
these
petitioners,
who
when
the
suit
was
filed
had
service
of
process
against
rudolf
wolff
&
company
and
against
james
gourlay,
all
find
themselves
relegated
to
the
state
remedy,
the
louisiana
state
long
arm
statute
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
have
got
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
nationals.
they
went
from
no
contest
as
to
having
it
to
being
relegated
to
the
state
claim
simply...
and
the
facts,
and
the
underlying
facts
of
causes
of
action
never
changed.
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
believe
that
insofar
as
this
cause
of
action
is
concerned
that
a
nationwide
national
contacts
theory
should
apply
and
that
rudolf
wolff
and
james
gourlay
have
both
been
found
to
have
national
contacts
with
the
united
states,
although
not
with
the
state
of
louisiana.
and
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
a.
kutcher
first,
i
will
respond
to
justice
stevens'
inquiry
regarding
what
happened
in
the
district
court
below.
the
district
court
judge
did
find
that
there
existed
adequate
national
contacts
based
on...
for
mr.
rudolf
wolff
and
mr.
james
gourlay,
and
held
that
he
had
personal
jurisdiction.
subsequently,
the
fifth
circuit
in
demelo
came
out
and
said:
you
have
to
look
to
the
state
statute
under
4(e).
and
that
was
when
they
came
back
for
motion
for
reconsideration.
and
the
district
court
judge
reversed
himself
based
on
the
demelo
decision,
but
there
was
no
question
that
the
judicial
determination
after
discovery
as
to
the
contacts
found
that
there
weren't
adequate
national
contacts.
the
national
contacts
theory
in
federal
question
cases
i
think
has
application
here
and,
as
judge
wisdom
indicated
in
dissent,
in
the
appellate
court
opinion,
is
something
which
the
court
should
consider
in
federal
question
cases.
mr.
paskoff's
argument
that
what
is
going
to
result
are
rampant
lawsuits
everywhere
in
all
federal
question
cases
ignores
what
i
alluded
to
in
my
argument
in
chief
and
that
is
the
venue
provisions
of
the
united
states
code
which
will
limit
where
litigation
can
take
place.
before
1963,
this
court
in
international
shoe
and
its
successors
determined
that
all
that
is
required
is
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
justice.
the
argument
that
a
rule
of
procedure
which
has
been
described
as
a
housekeeping
rule
should
somehow
control
the
rights
of
a
federal
litigant
in
a
federal
cause
of
action
in
a
federal
court
is
something
which
places
procedure
over
substance.
this
is
a
commodities
fraud
claim.
the
exclusive
place
to
bring
it
is
in
the
united
states
district
courts.
and
the
effect
of
the
fifth
circuit
decision
is
to
insulate
the
foreign
aliens
from
any
action
in
any
district
court
because
they
don't
have
adequate
contacts
with
that
particular
district,
although
there
is
no
question
that
they
have
contacts
with
the
entire
country.
i
thank
your
honors
for
your
time.
if
you
have
got
any
questions,
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
them.
