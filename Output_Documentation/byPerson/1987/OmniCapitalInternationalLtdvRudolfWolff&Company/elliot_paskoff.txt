mr.
elliot
paskoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
address
the
limitations
of
personal
jurisdiction
in
federal
courts
over
non-residents,
i
think
we
should
start
in
the
beginning.
pursuant
to
article
3,
section
1
of
the
constitution,
it
is
congress
that
is
ordained...
that
may
ordain
and
create
the
lower
federal
courts.
our
federal
court
system
is
a
creature
of
congressional
grant
as
a
limited...
as
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
our
federal
district
courts
may
not
create
their
own
jurisdictional
premise.
if
we
delve
back
into
history,
we
find
that
the
members
of
this
nation's
first
congress
were
concerned
with
pre-revolutionary
oppressiveness
of
causing
persons
to
travel
long
distances
to
settle
their
disputes.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
yes,
sir.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
your
honor,
what
has
happened
is
in
the
original
point
landing
litigation,
one
of
my
clients,
rudolf
wolff
&
co.,
ltd.
,
was
named
as
a
direct
party.
that
defendant
moved
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
assert
impersonum
jurisdiction
under
section
27.
we
never
conceded
that
we
were
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court
in
louisiana
pursuant
to
section
27.
the
reason
why
we
never
conceded
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
assertion
of
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
non-resident
is
a
dual-pronged
requirement.
and
these
are
not
parallel
prongs.
the
initial
prong
is
you
require
a
statutory
grant
from
congress--
mr.
elliot
paskoff
--yes,
but
then
you
had
the
next
step.
the
next
step
was
whether
or
not
that
statutory
grant
as
applied
comports
with
traditional
notions
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
exactly.
now,
understanding
the--
mr.
elliot
paskoff
--your
honor,
that
motion...
that
motion
was
decided...
the
motion
was
decided
and
that
was
point
landing
1.
in
point
landing
1,
the
federal
district
court
held
that
there
was
impersonum
jurisdiction.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
yes.
but
we
also
argued
at
that
time,
your
honor,
that
the
commodities
act
as
amended
in
1974
granted
exclusive
jurisdiction...
i
know
this
is
not
part
of
this
petition,
but
we
did
argue
that
it
granted
exclusive
jurisdiction
through
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
and
to
the
federal
district
courts.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
if
i
had
lost
under
that
argument,
we
would
have
been
before
the
court.
that's
right.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
that
is
correct.
under
section
27
of
the
federal
securities--
mr.
elliot
paskoff
--i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
because
if
the
commodities
exchange
act
has
preempted
the
regulation
of
commodities
futures
trading,
then
section
27
does
not
apply
because
the
commodity...
because
the
securities
exchange
act
is
not
applicable
to
determining
the
duties
and
liabilities
involved
with
trading
of
commodity
futures.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
well,
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
your
honor,
except
congressional
history
has
clearly
indicated
that
the
commodity
exchange
act
preempts--
mr.
elliot
paskoff
--that
is
correct.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
that's
correct.
part
of
the
second
prong
of
the
petitioners'
request
to
this
court
is
to
ask
for
an
implication
of
nationwide
service
of
process
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
congress
has
had
three
separate
opportunities
within
the
last
12
years
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
nationwide
service
of
process.
in
1974,
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
act
was
enacted
and
it
specifically
conferred
nationwide
service
of
process
under
section
13(a)(1)
on
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission.
it
similarly
conferred
nationwide
service
of
process
on
the
sister
states'
attorney
generals
under
section
13(a)(2).
nowhere
was
there
a
mention
that
there
was
a
nationwide
service
of
process
for
private
litigants.
this
court
decided
merrill
lynch
v.
curran
in
1982,
holding
that
a
private
right
of
action
exists
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
in
1982,
the
futures
trading
act
amending
the
commodity
exchange
act
expressly
provided
for
a
private
right
of
action
by
a
private
litigant
aggrieved
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
that
was
the
perfect
place
if
congress
had
so
intended
to
assert
a
nationwide
service
of
process
clause
for
private
litigants.
that
act
is
silent.
that
provision
does
not
provide
for
nationwide
service
of
process
in
enforcing
private
claims.
congressional
history
with
respect
to
the
enactment
of
section
25
in
1982
indicates
that
congress
recognized...
the
agricultural
committee
of
the
house
stated
that
congress
does
not
intend
to
rely
upon
private
litigants
as
the
policemen
of
the
commodity
exchange
act.
more
recently,
congress
enacted
the
futures
trading
act
of
1986
which
among
other
provisions
granted
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
the
power
to
serve
extra-territorial
subpoenas
beyond
the
united
states'
territories.
in
the
conference
committee
report
relating
to
that
provision,
the
conference
committee
has
instructed
the
commissioners
that
prior
to
the
issuance
of
a
pre-complaint
investigatory
subpoena
they
must
confer
with
the
department
of
state
in
order
to
meet
with
representatives
of
the
receiving
nation
so
as
not
to
cause
a
perception
of
intrusion
on
the
sovereignty
of
the
receiving
nation.
it
is
not
surprising
in
light
of
the
caution
and
sensitivity
expressed
by
congress
in
dealing
with
aliens
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
a
restrictive
scope
of
personal
jurisdiction
has
been
defined
because
congress
simply
cannot
restrain
private
litigants
in
their
dealing
with
aliens.
so,
we
are
left
with
the
statutes,
the
commodity
exchange
act.
it
has
in
some
sections
grants
of
nationwide
service
of
process
with
respect
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
and
in
other
sections
relating
to
private
action,
there
is
no
such
language.
this
court
has
observed
in
russello
v.
united
states
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
construction
that
where
congress
includes
particular
language
in
one
part
of
the
statute
but
omits
that
language
in
another
section
of
the
statute,
it
will
be
presumed
that
that
omission
was
intentional
and
deliberate.
the
basic
assumption
is
that
congress
knows
how
to
write
its
statutes.
i
think
the
likely
inference
that
i
draw
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
grant
extra-territorial
jurisdiction
as
a
weapon
to
private
litigants.
for
that
reason,
i
would
urge
this
court
to
reject
the
request
by
the
petitioners
to
imply
a
nationwide
service
of
process
clause
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
mr.
elliot
paskoff
your
honor,
not
necessarily.
and
the
reason...
i
am
quite
familiar
with
your
decision
in
merrill
lynch
v.
curran.
the
congressional
intent
relied
upon
by
the
majority
seemed
to
want
to
preserve
a
private
right
of
action
which
existed
by
case
law
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
act
of
1974.
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
by
case
law.
so
all
that
decision
does
is
preserve.
congress
did
not
intend,
congress
did
not
specifically
intend
to
eliminate
that
private
right
of
action.
when
a
federal
statute
is
silent
as
to
a
provision
for
nationwide
service
of
process,
rule
4(e)
instructs
us
how
to
obtain
impersonum
jurisdiction
over
a
non-resident.
1963,
we
had
4(e)
amended
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
used
the
language,
"service
of
process
may
be
made
under
the
circumstances
and
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
statute
or
rule
of
the
state
where
the
district
court
is
sitting.
"
the
commentators
including
the
reporter
to
the
advisory
committee
in
1963
have
indicated
that
it
was
the
intent
to
incorporate
by
reference
the
state's
standard
of
amenability
to
personal
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
other
reason
to
include
the
language
under
the
circumstances
but
for
to
include
the
state
standard
of
personal
jurisdiction.
thus,
if
respondents
wolff
and
gourlay
were
amenable
to
the
impersonum
jurisdiction
of
the
louisiana
long
arm
statute,
then
they
would
be
amenable
to
the
impersonum
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court
under
4(e).
petitioners
concede
and
this
can
be
found
at
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix.
petitioners
concede
and
plaintiffs
concede
that
there
is
no
personal
jurisdiction
under
the
louisiana
long
arm
statute.
what
concerns
me
is
an
implication
of
nationwide
service
of
process
under
the
commodity
exchange
act.
if
that
were
to
be
granted
today
would,
by
analogy,
be
applicable
to
every
single
federal
question
statute
which
is
silent
as
to
service
of
process.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
any
member
of
the
court
has
a
question
for
me,
i
would
respond.
otherwise,
i
will
sit.
