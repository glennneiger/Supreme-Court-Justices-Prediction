chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
on
no.
86-740,
omni
capital
international
v.
rudolf
wolff
&
company.
mr.
kutcher,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
source
of
authority
to
serve
process.
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
restriction
on
the
authority
of
government.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
why
do
you
say
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
source
of
authority?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
not.
the
fifth
amendment,
you
agree,
is
not
an
affirmative
grant
of
authority
to
anyone.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
you
go
again
and
say
the
source
of
the
authority
comes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
source
of
the
authority
has
to
come
from
somewhere
else.
where
does
it
come
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
then
that
we
can
presume
that
congress
wished
to
reach
out
in
every
federal
question
cause
of
action
to
the
limits
of
the
due
process
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course.
but
there
is
always
the
question
entirely
apart
from
the
constitutional
limitation
whether
the
person
having
the
authority
wishes
to
exercise
it.
and
that
is
the
intimation
i
drew
from
justice
o'connor's
question
is
that
congress
in
several
sections
of
the
securities
act
has
indicated:
yes,
we
do
want
to
reach
as
far
as
we
can.
but
you
say
that
you
don't
need
any
indication
like
that
from
congress
because
in
every
case
they
have
created
a
federal
question
claim,
they
are
going
to
be
presumed
to
want
to
reach
as
far
as
they
can.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
could
be,
too,
couldn't
it
to
authorize
substitute
service,
substitute
service
of
process
where
one
method
has
been
tried
and
the
person
can't
be
found
at
the
address?
that
was
the
practice
in
arizona.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--let
me
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
kutcher.
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
rule
83,
does
that
mean
that
the
district
court
in
new
orleans
can
have
a
rule
saying:
we
want
to
go
to
the
full
extent
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
these
cases.
and
western
district
in
shreveport
can
say:
well,
no,
we
don't
think
we
will
go
that
far.
i
mean
is
it
93
different
rules
for
93
different
districts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
authority?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now,
are
you
going
to
get
back
to
my
question
about
rule
83?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
how
do
you
determine
which
rule
is
right
in
the
various
districts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
compliance
with
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
that
every
district
has
to
promulgate
a
rule
that
goes
as
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
permitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
one
particularly,
the
chief
judge
up
in
shreveport
says:
i
may
have
that
authority,
but
i
just
don't
choose
to
exercise
it.
that
is
not
the
way
i
read
this
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kutcher.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
paskoff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
paskoff.
mr.
kutcher,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kutcher.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-740,
omni
capital
investment
versus
rudolf
wolff
&
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
