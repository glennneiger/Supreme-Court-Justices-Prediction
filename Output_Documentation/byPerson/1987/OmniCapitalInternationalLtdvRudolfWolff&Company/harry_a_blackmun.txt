justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
does
not
lend
itself
well
to
announcement
from
the
bench
and
i
think
it
will
be
suffice
to
say
that
the
primary
issue
is
whether
a
federal
court
in
louisiana
had
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
british
corporation
and
the
person
who
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
kingdom.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
personal
jurisdiction
was
lacking
and
that
the
requirements
of
the
louisiana
long-arm
statute
were
not
met.
we
affirm
that
judgment.
the
requirement
of
personal
jurisdiction
here
flows
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
noticed
to
the
defendant
and
the
constitutionally
sufficient
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
four
or
more
not
in
themselves
enough.
the
defendant
also
must
be
amenable
to
service
of
summons,
and
we
refrained
from
treating
judicially
a
common
law
rule
that
authorizes
service
in
this
litigation,
and
that
responsibility
we
feel
rest
with
those
who
proposed
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
with
congress.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
