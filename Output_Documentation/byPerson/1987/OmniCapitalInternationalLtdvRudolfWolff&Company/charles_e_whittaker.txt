well,
mr.
kutcher,
i
think
most
decisions
in
this
area
have
taken
the
position
that
federal
courts
have
only
as
much
subject
matter
and
personal
jurisdiction
as
congress
gives
them
by
affirmative
grant.
justice
whittaker
and
under
your
theory,
there
would
not
be
an
affirmative
grant
of
jurisdiction
then.
justice
whittaker
yes.
justice
whittaker
well,
i
suppose
the
weight
of
authority
might
be
against
you
on
this
point;
wouldn't
it?
