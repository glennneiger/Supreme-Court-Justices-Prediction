justice
o'connor
mr.
kutcher,
there
are
some
federal
statutes
in
which
congress
has
expressly
adopted
a
provision
such
as
you
would
have
us
apply
here
without
an
express
provision.
justice
o'connor
so,
i
guess,
under
your
view,
all
those
affirmative
grants
of
jurisdiction
on
a
national
basis
by
congress
are
superfluous.
they
are
not
necessary.
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
think
that
that
action
by
congress
is
just
not
necessary.
it's
superfluous.
