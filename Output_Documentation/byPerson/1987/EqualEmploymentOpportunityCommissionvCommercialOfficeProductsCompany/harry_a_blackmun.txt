justice
blackmun
well,
it
certainly
isn't
always
black
and
white,
either,
is
it?
justice
blackmun
there
is
certainly
something
to
be
said
for
your
argument
that
you
don't
want
a
federal
agency
to
be
deciding
these
state-law
questions.
justice
blackmun
well,
you
had
a
dissent
on
the
tenth
circuit,
didn't
you?
justice
blackmun
which
would
be
indicative
of
ambiguity,
wouldn't
it?
justice
blackmun
judge
mckay.
justice
blackmun
let
me
give
you
an
example
right
here
in
this
court.
we
have
a
case
that
comes
down;
a
petition
for
rehearing
is
filed
within
the
timely
period...
denied.
then
two
years
go
by,
and
a
decision
comes
down
from
the
court
that
seems
to
bear
on
the
earlier
case.
a
petition
for
leave
to
file
a
second
petition
for
rehearing
is
filed.
we
consider
it,
don't
we?
justice
blackmun
does
that
mean
that
the
case
did
not
terminate
before?
justice
blackmun
so
do
i.
then
you
ought
to
reconsider
whether
you
think
something
that
has
been
terminated
can
be
reopened.
can
something
that
has
been
terminated
be
recommenced?
justice
blackmun
why
does
it
have
to
be
happenstance?
couldn't
he
walk
in
purposefully?
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
who
is
going
to
determine
that?
justice
blackmun
yes.
justice
blackmun
so
you
want
a
federal
agency
to
determine
timeliness
under
state
law
on
every
one
of
these
claims?
justice
blackmun
it
doesn't
sound
quite
right
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
agency
that
ought
to
determine
that
is
the
state
agency.
certainly,
in
a
lot
of
these
cases,
timeliness
is
not
readily
apparent,
or,
untimeliness
is
not
readily
apparent.
justice
blackmun
you're
going
to
bring
him
in
now,
too.
