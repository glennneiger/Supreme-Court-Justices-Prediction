mr.
james
l.
stone
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
timeliness
of
a
charge
of
employment
discrimination
submitted
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
290
days
after
the
alleged
discriminatory
act.
under
this
court's
decision
in
mohasco,
in
the
clear
language
of
section
706(c)
of
title
vii,
charges
filed
more
than
240
days
after
the
alleged
discriminatory
act
are
only
timely
if
the
state
agency
terminates
it
proceedings
prior
to
the
300th
day.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
"terminated",
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
word
should
be
given
its
plain
and
ordinary
meaning,
which
means
"to
complete,
or
to
end.
"
the
word
"terminated"
does
not
mean
"suspend".
when
you
give
the
word
"terminated"
its
plain
and
ordinary
meaning,
it
is
beyond
question
that
the
charge
here
was
untimely,
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
defined
"terminated"
by
saying
it
meant
the
completion
or
ending
of
activity.
it
found
it
difficult
to
understand
how
this
definition
could
in
any
way
be
controversial.
for
those
who
have
doubts
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
"terminated",
they
may
look
at
a
number
of
accepted
sources
an
authorities
to
confirm
that
the
word
means
what
the
tenth
circuit
said
it
meant.
we
have
an
example--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
justice--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--judge
mckay
did
believe
that
the
statute
might
have
been
ambiguous.
we
have
examined
a
dozen
or
more
dictionaries,
and
you
can
pick
up
any
dictionary
you
come
across.
you
will
find
that
the
word
"terminated"
is
always
defined
as
"to
complete
or
to
end".
no
where
will
you
find
that
it's
defined
to
mean
"suspend".
another
source
which
reveals
the
commonly-understood
meaning
of
the
word
1980.
on
three
separate
occasions,
while
the
court
was
explaining
the
operation
of
section
706(c)
in
that
opinion
the
court
used
synonyms
for
the
word
"terminated".
the
court
used
the
word
"ended"
in
place
of
the
word
"terminated".
the
court
used
the
word
"completed"
in
place
of
the
word
"terminated".
and
in
footnote
16,
the
court
stated
that
if
a
complainant
submits
a
charge
of
employment
discrimination
to
the
eeoc
more
than
240
days
after
the
alleged
discriminatory
act,
his
right
to
seek
relief
under
title
vii
will
be
preserve
if
the
state
agency
happens
to
complete
its
proceedings
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
300th
day.
the
petitioner
here,
itself
gave
the
word
"terminated"
the
same
meaning
that
we
are
suggesting
in
its
amicus
brief
in
mohasco.
on
two
different
occasions
in
the
amicus
brief,
the
petitioner
also
used
synonyms
for
the
word
706(c).
mr.
james
l.
stone
i
don't
believe
you
can,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
i
think
the
case
terminated
before.
mr.
james
l.
stone
no,
no
your
honor.
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
question--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--i
think
when
something
is
terminated,
it
comes
to
a
completion
or
an
ending.
mr.
james
l.
stone
i
don't
believe
you
can.
i
believe
it's
a
new
and
separate
and
distinct
event.
our
interpretation
of
the
word
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history.
senator
dirksen
used
the
words
706(c).
in
that
same
context,
on
a
number
of
other
occasions,
he
said
that
the
state
of
fair
employment
practice
agencies
"dispose
of"
charges
in
a
matter
of
a
week
or
two.
and
in
specifically
referring
to
the
state
of
california,
he
said
that
they
"disposed
of"
charges
in
five
days.
our
interpretation
is
consistent
with
senator
dirksen's
use
of
the
words
"dispose
of".
mr.
james
l.
stone
well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--in
those
rare
situations,
for
example,
where
the
termination
itself
might
have
been
procured
by
fraud,
and
the
state
agency
a
year
or
two
later
realizes
that,
because
these
statues
are
equitable
in
nature,
the
agency
can
go
back
in
and
reopen
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
james
l.
stone
but
it's--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--but
we
view
it
as
being
a
different
proceeding,
and
petitioner
claims
that
the
state
agency
was
going
to
act
further.
we
agree
with
that.
they
were
going
to
act
further.
we
believe
that
that
is
evidence
that
the
state
intended
to
take
further
action
and
didn't
terminate
its
proceedings
under
section
706(c).
there
even
more
persuasive
legislative
history,
however,
and
those
are
the
statements
of
senator
case,
who
was
one
of
the
floor
leaders
for
this
particular
legislation.
on
june
9,
1964,
the
day
before
the
historic
cloture
vote,
senator
case
stated
that
carefully-drafted
provisions
of
the
bill
require
that
if
there
is
possible
reason
to
believe
that
the
state
agency
will
deal
with
the
matter,
it
will
have
sixty
days
in
which
to
deal
with
it
before
the
federal
agency
will
be
called
in.
senator
case
also
said
earlier
that
day,
and
perhaps
even
more
importantly,
that
only
when
the
states
have
no
colorable
claim
to
give
consideration
to
such
matters
can
they
be
considered
by
the
federal
government
during
the
first
sixty
days.
here
the
facts
demonstrate
that
the
state
agency
did
not
dispose
of
this
charge.
here
the
facts
demonstrate
that
there
was
possible
reason
to
believe
that
the
state
agency
would
deal
with
this
charge
further.
here
there
is
evidence
that
the
state
did
retain
a
colorable
claim
to
process
this
charge
further.
mr.
james
l.
stone
justice
white,
under
our
statute,
the
statute
of
limitations
will
not
bar
the
processing
of
a
charge
until
the
respondent
raises
it
as
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
james
l.
stone
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
well,
it
is
an
alternative
argument.
we
believe
that
in
this
situation
the
charge
had
to
be
timely
under
state
law
to
receive
the
extended
filing
period.
there
had
to
be
an
agency
with
authority
to
grant
or
seek
relief.
mr.
james
l.
stone
but
it
doesn't
have
authority
to
grant
or
seek
relief
with
respect
to
this
charge.
mr.
james
l.
stone
because
this
charge
was
not
timely.
mr.
james
l.
stone
yes.
the
three
documents
demonstrate
conclusively
that
there
has
been
no
termination
here.
the
first
is
the
work-sharing
agreement,
which
is
found
in
the
appendix
end
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
in
the
last
sentence
of
paragraph
five
of
the
work-sharing
agreement,
it
provides
that
the
colorado
civil
rights
agency
will
review
the
eeoc's
resolution
of
any
charges
which
it
initially
processes.
this
establishes
the
state's
intention
to
take
further
action.
the
second
document
is
a
letter
which
the
state
agency
wrote
to
the
charging
party
the
day
after
it
received
notification
that
she
had
filed
a
charge
with
the
federal
government.
that's
found
at
appendix
i
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
in
that
letter,
the
state
agency
informed
the
charging
party
that
it
assigned
her
charge
a
number,
that
it
would
not
take
any
action
on
her
charge
until
the
federal
government
terminated
its
proceedings,
that
it
advised
her
that
the
state
agency
had
to
take
final
action
on
her
charge
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
and
that
it
informed
her
how
to
enlarge
that
period
of
time.
finally,
it
told
her
to
keep
the
state
agency
advised
of
her
address
and
telephone
number,
and
that
he
cooperation
in
these
matters
was
essential.
this
is
not
the
action
of
an
agency
which
has
disposed
of
a
charge.
the
third
exhibit
which
is
decisive
is
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
transmittal
form,
which
is
found
at
appendix
h.
the
top
portion
of
the
form
is
to
be
completed
by
the
eeoc,
and
then
it's
sent
to
the
state
agency,
where
the
state
agency
may
complete
the
bottom
portion
of
the
form.
the
form
allows
the
ccard,
which
is
the
state
agency
in
this
case,
to
express
its
intentions
with
respect
to
how
it
wants
to
process
the
charge.
it's
given
three
choices.
it
chose
the
second
choice,
to
initially
waive
processing
of
the
charge.
it
did
not
choose
the
third
choice,
which
was
to
dismiss
or
close
the
charge.
mr.
james
l.
stone
that
is
at
page
27(a),
appendix
h,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
it's
the
last
box
on
the
bottom
of
the
form.
mr.
james
l.
stone
here
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
concept
of
initial
waiver
of
processing,
which
results
in
a
temporary
cessation
or
suspension
state
proceedings,
is
the
equivalent
of
termination,
and
relies
on
a
first
circuit
opinion,
isaac
v.
harvard
university.
we
submitted,
and
the
tenth
circuit
agreed,
that
the
first
circuit's
definition
of
the
word
"terminated"
is
very
strained.
and
to
give
the
word
"terminated"
such
a
strained
meaning
here
is
particularly
inappropriate.
this
provision,
section
706(c)
which
we're
talking
about,
and
the
deferral
requirement,
was
at
the
heart
of
the
compromise...
the
very
compromise
which
ended
the
longest
filibuster
in
the
history
of
the
senate,
and
eventually
led
to
the
passage
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
senator
javitz
remarked
that
that
compromise
was
razor-thin,
and
there
was
no
place
to
move
either
way
off
the
edge
of
the
razor.
other
senators
have
remarked
that
but
for
the
compromise,
there
would
not
have
been
passage
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
at
that
time.
senator
dirksen,
who
was
the
chief
architect
for
this
amendment
stated
that
this
measure
had
received
meticulous
attention.
the
drafters
gave
meticulous
attention
to
the
meaning
of
every
word,
of
every
comma,
and
the
shading
of
every
phrase.
mr.
james
l.
stone
well,
they
were
concerned,
your
honor,
with
the
fact
that
the
state
agency
would
be
free
to
act
without
federal
intervention,
and
that
the
federal
government
would
be
prohibited
from
acting
during
this
deferral
period.
the
federal
government
is
prohibited
from
acting.
and
if
they're
prohibited
from
acting
during
this
period,
they
can
not
accept
the
charge
for
filing,
and
they
can
not
being
investigating
the
charge.
mr.
james
l.
stone
yes,
that's
correct.
the
interpretation
which
the
petitioner
here
gives
to
the
word
"terminated"
in
this
case
effectively
does
away
with
that
deferral
requirement.
it
completely
writes
it
out
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
deferral.
this
is
true
not
only
in
this
case,
but
in
countless
other
cases,
where
the
equal
employment
opportunity--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--well,
i'm
speaking,
your
honor,
where
the
state
initially
waives
processing.
mr.
james
l.
stone
because
in
these
situations,
there
is
an
advance
waiver.
that
occurs
today.
the
discriminatory
act
may
occur
six
months
from
now,
and
the
charge
may
be
filed
five
months
after
that.
so
they
have
waived
well
in
advance
of
even
the
act
occurring
of
the
charge
being
filed...
any
charge
being
filed.
and
according
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
however--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--that's
what
they
say.
mr.
james
l.
stone
pardon
me?
mr.
james
l.
stone
they
sent
a
copy
of
the
charge
with
the
charge
transmittal
form
to
the
state
agency.
the
charge
transmittal
form
is
exhibit--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--well,
under
the
work-sharing
agreement,
the
state
said
it
had
waived.
mr.
james
l.
stone
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--they
could
have
by
notifying
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
that
they
did
not
desire
to
go
forward
under
their
previously-agreed-to
arrangement.
mr.
james
l.
stone
that's
correct.
that's
the
provision
contained
in
the
work-sharing
agreement.
they
waived
this
well
in
advance
of
the
state
having
any
knowledge
of
this
charge.
mr.
james
l.
stone
or
if
the
complainant
would
happen
to
walk
into
the
state
agency
as
opposed
to
the
federal
agency,
just
by
happenstance.
mr.
james
l.
stone
well,
yes,
i'm
sure
they
could.
but
under
the
waiver
agreement,
your
honor,
charging
parties
who
walk
into
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission's
offices
will
have
their
charge
processed
by
the
eeoc,
even
though
the
statue
requires
that
the
eeoc
defer
for
sixty
days.
let
me
comment
briefly
on
the
second
part
of
our
brief.
up
until
this
point,
our
argument
on
termination
has
assumed
that
the
extended
300-day
filing
period
applies
to
this
charge.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
applies
because
the
charge
was
untimely
under
state
law.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
basic
filing
period
under
title
vii
was
180
days
for
charges
arising
in
jurisdictions
that
did
not
have
a
state
or
local
agency
which
could
grant
or
seek
relief
from
such
practice.
under
special
circumstances,
however,
in
deferral
states,
the
limitation
may
be
extended
by
an
additional
120
days
to
reach
the
magic
number
of
300.
this
extended
filing
period
is
only
available,
however,
where
the
charging
party
initially
institutes
proceedings
in
a
state
or
local
agency
which
as
authority
to
grant
or
seek
relief
from
the
particular
charge.
here
the
state
agency
didn't
have
that
authority,
if
the
charge
was
untimely
under
state
law.
under
the
united
airlines
v.
evans
case,
this
court
said,
"a
discriminatory
act,
which
is
not
made
the
basis
for
a
timely
charge
of
discrimination,
is
the
legal
equivalent
of
a
discriminatory
act
which
occurred
before
the
passage
of
the
act.
"
it's
an
unfortunate
event,
but
it
has
no
legal
consequence.
consequently,
if
an
untimely
state
charge
has
no
legal
consequence,
the
state
agency
doesn't
have
any
authority
to
grant
or
seek
relief
over
that
charge.
mr.
james
l.
stone
who's
going
to
determine
if
the
charge
is
timely
under
state
law?
mr.
james
l.
stone
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
can,
or
the
state
agency
can.
mr.
james
l.
stone
in
the
situation
where
the
extended
filing
period
is
to
be
allowed--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--well,
in
those
situations,
there
might
be
a
little
more
work
involved.
senator
humphrey,
during
the
debate
to--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--i'm
not
thinking
of
your
home
state,
your
honor,
when
i
mentioned
it.
but
senator
humphrey
said
and
recognized
that
this
approach
that
was
devised
was
not
the
fast
approach.
he
understood
that
it
was
somewhat
cumbersome,
and
he
acknowledged
that.
but
it
was
what
was
needed
to
get
the
filibuster
defeated,
and
there
had
to
be
some
give
and
take.
he
said
this
might
be
a
slower
approach,
and
a
more
cumbersome
approach.
mr.
james
l.
stone
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
stone
i
guess
it
would
depend
on
the
situation.
there
are
times
when,
depending
on
when
the
charge
is
filed,
how
quickly
after
the
discriminatory
act,
where
the
state
agency
would
still
have
time
to
review
the
federal
charge.
you
could
have
a
situation
where--
mr.
james
l.
stone
--not
routinely,
your
honor.
it
takes
the
eeoc
some
time
to
process
charges.
but
what
happens
here
is
that
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
with
the
states
for
the
first
sixty
days.
the
federal
government
can
not
act
during
that
sixty-day
period.
if
the
charge
is
timely
under
state
law
and
under
federal
law,
after
