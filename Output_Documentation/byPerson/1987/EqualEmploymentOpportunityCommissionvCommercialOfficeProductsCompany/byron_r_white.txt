justice
white
and
there
had
been
no
termination.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
there
is
a
termination,
even
though
the
case
is
going
to
go
back
to
that
state
commission?
justice
white
and
it
happens
sometimes
that
that
occurs.
justice
white
even
though
it's
been
terminated?
justice
white
well,
like
a
play,
it
can
come
on
the
next
night.
justice
white
you
mean
that
the
agency
can
just
waive
the
time
limit
if
it
wants
to?
justice
white
do
you
think
congress
really
anticipated
that
the
state
agency
could,
just
in
any
case
that
was
referred
to
it
or
filed
with
it,
say,
"sorry,
we
just
don't
want
to
do
this.
"
"let
the
eeoc
do
it
in
the
first
instance.
"
justice
white
i
thought
that
congress
really
wanted
to
really
refer
the
states
to
process
these
cases
first.
justice
white
i'm
not
asking
who
has
the
longest
back
log.
they're
just
trading
back
logs
aren't
they?
justice
white
this
is
just
an
argument
that
the
statute
of
limitations
should
be
extended.
after
all,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
if
there
was
a
filing
before
the
240
days.
justice
white
the
only
reason
is
that
there's
a
filing,
there's
a
reference
to
the
state
after
240
days.
justice
white
the
result
couldn't
have
happened
if
plaintiff
had
filed
with
the
eeoc
soon
enough.
justice
white
well,
exactly.
it's
always
true.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
how
could
the
state
have
done
it
if
the
charge
was
outside
its
time
limits?
justice
white
well,
do
you
give
up
on
you
180-day
argument?
justice
white
how
do
you
make
it,
then?
justice
white
well,
there
is
an
agency.
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
well,
you
just
told
me
that
unless
the
defendant
raises
it,
the
state
can
go
right
ahead
and
the
agency
can't.
the
180
days
is
a
zero.
isn't
that
what
you
just
told
me?
justice
white
where
is
this?
i
don't
see
these.
justice
white
you
mean,
here
this
charge
was
filed
with
the
eeoc
290
days
after
the
event.
then
the
eeoc
"referred
it".
is
that
right?
justice
white
how
did
they
do
it?
justice
white
how
did
they
do
it?
justice
white
prior
to
that
time,
the
state
hadn't
waived
anything.
justice
white
well,
it
waives
as
soon
as
it
sends
it
back.
justice
white
well,
you
mean
the
state
couldn't
have
kept
this
proceeding
and
investigated
it
itself?
justice
white
you
mean
every
single
thing
that
is
filed
with
the
eeoc
and
referred
to
the
state...
it
is
assumed
that
the
state
is
going
to
waive?
justice
white
so
the
only
cases
that
the
eeoc
isn't
going
to
go
forward
with
itself,
initially,
is
when
they
get
a
notice
back
that
"we
want
to
handle
this
case.
"
