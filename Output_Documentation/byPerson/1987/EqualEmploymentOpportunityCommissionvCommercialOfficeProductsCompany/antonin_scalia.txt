justice
scalia
i
know
a
lot
of
terminal
patients
who
will
be
delighted
to
hear
this.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
it
sounds
like
it
didn't
even
terminate.
it
didn't
even
commence,
did
it?
justice
scalia
how
did
it
commence?
they
said
they
declined
to
take
any
action.
justice
scalia
they
didn't
even
process
it.
but
it
was
filed.
justice
scalia
well,
what
the
respondents
say
to
that,
i
think,
is
that
you
can
read
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
was
worried
about
the
federal
government
doing
too
much
of
these
things.
they
really
wanted
the
states
to
do
most
of
them.
therefore,
they
put
in
the
termination
provision;
the
state
had
to
let
go.
justice
scalia
you
say
this
is
very
harmonious,
but
under
it
the
federal
government's
doing
an
awful
lot
of
the
processing
rather
than
the
states.
justice
scalia
but
congress
may
have
been
worried
about
that,
about
the
states
themselves
wanting
to
push
as
much
of
the
work
as
possible
onto
the
federal
government.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
congress
wanting
to
prevent
the
states,
even
if
they
wanted
to,
from
chucking
off
so
much
of
that
work.
justice
scalia
this
cooperative
arrangement
would
work
just
as
efficiently
if
we
interpreted
"terminate"
to
mean
"terminate"
the
way
it
means
"terminate"
normally.
if
the
state
simply
had
to
cut
the
line
and
sent
back
the
notice
saying,
"we
are
completed
with
this
proceeding.
"
then,
if
it
wanted
to
reopen
the
proceeding
after
the
federal
government
was
done,
somebody's
brief
says,
"there's
nothing
that
stops
a
proceeding
that
has
been
terminated
from
being
reopened.
"
now,
if
this
is
only
happening
four
times
a
year,
it's
hard
to
believe
that
it's
going
to
destroy
this
cooperative
arrangement
to
simply
require
them
to
terminate
it,
and
then
reopen
it
the
four
times
a
year
when
they
have
to.
justice
scalia
you
can't
recommence
something
that's
been
terminated?
justice
scalia
and
you
can't
start
it
up
again?
justice
scalia
then
i
guess
none
of
these
states
ever
terminate
any
of
their
proceedings.
i'm
sure
that
in
all
of
them
you
could
reopen
a
proceeding
for
some
reason,
certainly
for
fraud.
if
it
is
discovered
that
there
has
been
fraud
in
a
terminated
proceeding,
i'm
sure
you
can
reopen
it.
justice
scalia
so
if
that's
the
case,
then
none
of
these
proceedings
is
ever
terminated
in
these
states.
justice
scalia
so
you
can
reopen
a
terminated
proceeding?
justice
scalia
why
does
it
make
so
much
difference
to
you
whether
you
can
reopen
a
terminated
proceeding
or
not?
why
is
that
important
to
your
case?
i
don't
understand
why
you're
fighting
it.
it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
you
can
reopen
a
terminated
proceeding.
justice
scalia
appendix
h.
i
have
appendix
h.
where's
the
dismissal?
justice
scalia
to
dismiss,
close.
got
you.
justice
scalia
is
the
effect
of
the
sharing
agreement
here
not
only
to
lengthen
the
federal
period,
as
you
suggest,
but
also
to
lengthen
the
period
within
which
the
state
can
act?
justice
scalia
what
are
the
limitations
upon
the
state
acting
after
the
federal
government
has
acted?
are
there
any?
justice
scalia
can
a
state
agency
routinely
wait
for
the
federal
government
to
process
the
charge,
and
then
conduct
its
proceeding
after
that?
