mr.
lazarus,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily,
"termination"
means
"end",
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
"terminus"
is
a
latin
word
that
means
"end".
chief
justice
rehnquist
something
can
have
many
ends.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
when
something
ceases
temporarily,
you
ordinarily
would
say
it's
"suspended".
you
wouldn't
say
that
it
was
"terminated".
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it
seems
to
me
if
congress
meant
what
you
say
it
meant,
it
would
have
said
that
the
state
agency
relinquishes
jurisdiction
over
the
proceedings.
if
all
they
meant
was,
"the
state
got
a
first
crack,
and
if
they
didn't
want
it....
"
but
instead,
they
used
the
word
"terminate".
i
don't
think
you
adequately
explained
the
use
of
that
word.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
ordinarily
think
of
someone
describing
a
law
suit
as
having
been
terminated,
you
think
it
may
just
have
been
temporarily
suspended,
maybe
a
little
continuance
or
a
recess?
i
certainly
don't
think
so.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
know
the
result
congress
was
aiming
for
is
to
read
the
language
that
congress
used.
and
it
used
the
word
"terminate".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
stone.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
government's
position
here
denies
to
the
state
of
colorado
anything
it
wanted
in
this
situation.
and
i
thought
that
was
what
the
compromise
was
about.
what
the
government's
position
here
does
is
make
the
statute
of
limitations
longer
than
it
would
be
under
your
construction.
but
were
the
members
of
congress
terribly
concerned
about
just
how
long
the
statue
limitations
would
be?
chief
justice
rehnquist
unless,
in
your
view,
the
state
actually
dismisses
it,
or
resolves
it
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stone.
mr.
lazarus,
you
have
three
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
the
case
is
submitted.
