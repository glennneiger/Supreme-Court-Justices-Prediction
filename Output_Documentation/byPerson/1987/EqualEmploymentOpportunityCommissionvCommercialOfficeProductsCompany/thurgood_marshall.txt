counsel,
strictly
on
words,
could
you
reopen
something
that
had
been
terminated?
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
that
why
you
say
"reopen"?
justice
marshall
it's
because
it
has
been
terminated.
justice
marshall
so
the
two
can
happen
together.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
eeoc
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
in
that
case,
we
hold
that
a
state
agency's
waiver
of
the
60-day
federal
period
provided
by
title
vii
constitutes
a
termination
of
state
proceedings
so
that
the
eeoc
may
immediately
began
to
process
the
charge
of
discrimination.
therefore,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
into
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
