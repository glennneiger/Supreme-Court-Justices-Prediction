justice
o'connor
--yes.
yes,
but
here
the
claim
was
referred
to
the
state
by
the
eeoc.
the
claimant
never
went
there.
justice
o'connor
it
was
referred
by
the
eeoc,
and
after
the
state's
statute
of
limitations
had
expired.
justice
o'connor
it
sure
does.
are
you
going
to
talk
about
that?
justice
o'connor
do
all
fifty
states
have
state
agencies
that
qualify?
justice
o'connor
that
still
do
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
effect
of
your
position
is
for
all
the
states
that
do
to
convert
the
180-day
time
limit,
plus
the
sixty
days,
into
a
300-day
time
limit.
that's
the
effect.
justice
o'connor
but
that's
what
you're
really
asking
us
to
do.
wouldn't
it
have
been
a
lot
easier
for
congress
to
just
say,
"well,
we're
going
to
have
a
300-day
time
limit.
"
if
that's
what
they
intended?
justice
o'connor
it
depends
on
how
you
interpret
the
language
of
a
state
agency...
what
do
they
say...
"with
the
authority"?
justice
o'connor
authorized
to
remedy.
in
this
case
there
wasn't
a
state
agency
that
could
entertain
it
when
it
was
referred.
