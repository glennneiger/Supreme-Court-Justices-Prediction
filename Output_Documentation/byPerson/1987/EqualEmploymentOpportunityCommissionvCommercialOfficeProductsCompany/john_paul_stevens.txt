what
did
they
indicate?
justice
stevens
is
that
all
they
said?
justice
stevens
but
didn't
they
simultaneously
say
they
postponed,
or
might
consider
it
later,
or
something
like
that?
the
big
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
that
was
the
termination
of
the
state
proceeding.
that's
the
critical
issue.
justice
stevens
they
reserved
jurisdiction;
that
was
their
language?
and
your
basic
position
is
that
nevertheless,
that
was
a
termination
within
the
meaning
of
706(e)?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
lazarus,
wasn't
there
another
policy
consideration
that
was
quite
important
in
this
whole
scheme
of
timing?
that
is
that
they
wanted
the
claimants
to
process
their
claims
promptly.
the
general
rule
was
an
180-rule.
justice
stevens
--give
them
an
opportunity
to--
justice
stevens
but
if
that's
such
a
rare
case,
why
don't
they
simply
terminate
the
proceeding?
justice
stevens
and
they're
protecting
their
jurisdiction
by
saying,
"well,
you
go
ahead
an
investigate
it
first,
and
if
we
are
not
satisfied
with
your
results,
why
then
we'll
take
a
second
look
at
it.
"
justice
stevens
that's
not
the
scheme
congress
created.
justice
stevens
no,
but
it
said,
"if
you
want
to
act
on
it,
you
act
first.
"
that's
what
it
said,
in
essence.
justice
stevens
thats
the
issue,
i
suppose,
in
the
case.
justice
stevens
not
only
an
opportunity,
but
it's
an
opportunity
that
makes
the
federal
government
wait
until
after
they
have
terminated
what
they're
doing.
justice
stevens
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
really
meant
to
say,
"well,
wait
until
they
say
they
just
as
soon
would
have
the
federal
government
go
first.
"
justice
stevens
but
then
you're
saying
that
all
of
that
extra
time
that
was
being
given
in
order
for
the
state
to
do
whatever
it
thought
was
necessary
in
order
to
terminate
the
proceeding
in
the
way
the
statute
literally
reads,
you're
going
to
get
that
time
anyway.
justice
stevens
even
though
the
state
is
doing
nothing
but
receiving
the
form
and
sending
it
back
after
checking
off
a
box.
justice
stevens
but
you're
saying--
justice
stevens
i
don't
follow
that.
why
couldn't
they
have
just
processed
the
claim?
justice
stevens
well,
yes.
but
congress
didn't
envision
this
work-sharing
agreement.
that's
a
creation
of
the
agencies.
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
need
a
work-sharing
agreement
like
this
in
order
to
give
the
state
agency
an
opportunity
to
process
the
claim
when
it's
referred
to
it.
justice
stevens
again,
it
all
boils
down
to
what
meaning
one
puts
on
the
word
"terminated".
justice
stevens
but
the
way
in
which
it
works
well
is
that
the
federal
agency
is
much
busier
than
congress
thought
it
would
be,
and
the
states
are
much
less
busy.
justice
stevens
of
course.
two-hundred
and
forty
days--
--yes.
justice
stevens
well,
under
the
court
of
appeals
rationale.
justice
stevens
if
they
had
filed
under
240
days,
they
would
have
been
okay.
justice
stevens
the
whole
point,
in
other
words,
is
to
be
sure
they
have
it
at
a
period
longer
than
240
days.
justice
stevens
subject
to
the
60-day
condition.
justice
stevens
but
they
have
a
limited
exception,
and
that
is
when
the
proceeding
is
earlier
terminated
by
the
states.
and
its
exceptions
are
generally
narrowly
construed.
justice
stevens
the
first
general
rule
is
180
days.
the
second
general
rule
is
240
days...
but
anyway,
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens
well,
that
isn't
quite
right.
there
is
deferral
if
the
states
wants
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
they
leave
it
up
to
the
state.
justice
stevens
oh,
sure.
