mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
on
writ
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
tenth
circuit
concerns
the
timeliness
of
a
charge
filed
with
the
eeoc
pursuant
to
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
respondent,
commercial
office
products
company,
has
refused
to
comply
with
an
administrative
subpoena
issued
by
the
eeoc
pursuant
to
title
vii
on
the
ground
that
the
underlying
discrimination
charge
was
not
timely
filed
with
the
commission.
whether
the
charge
was
timely
filed
depends
on
the
answers
to
two
different
questions.
first,
on
what
date
was
the
charge
first
filed
with
the
eeoc;
and
second,
what
were
the
applicable
statue
limitations
under
title
vii,
with
respect
to
this
particular
charge?
the
answers
to
these
two
questions,
in
turn,
depend
on
the
meaning
of
two
related
provisions
of
title
vii,
paragraphs
c
and
e
of
section
706.
the
first,
section
706(c)
provides
that
where
there
are
federal
and
state
agencies
with
overlapping
jurisdictions
to
remedy
a
certain
employment
discrimination
practice,
a
charge
alleging
such
a
practice
can
not
be
filed
with
the
eeoc
until
sixty
days
after
state
proceedings
have
commenced,
unless
such
proceedings
have
earlier
terminated.
the
second
provision,
section
706(e)
provides
that
the
normal
180-day
federal
limitations
period
does
not
apply
in
that
circumstance.
instead,
the
charge
must
be
filed
with
the
eeoc
within
300
days
of
the
alleged
discriminatory
practice,
or
within
thirty
days
of
the
termination
of
state
proceedings,
whichever
is
earlier.
the
timeliness
of
the
charge
in
this
case
depends
on
the
application
of
these
two
provisions
to
the
following
facts:
the
individual
complainant
in
this
case
submitted
a
charge
to
the
eeoc
in
which
she
alleged
that
290
days
earlier,
the
respondent,
commercial
office
products,
had
discharged
her
from
appointment
on
account
of
her
sex.
the
eeoc
subsequently
accepted
the
charge
for
filing.
upon
determining,
the
colorado
civil
rights
division
declined
initially
to
process
the
charge,
and
wanted
the
eeoc
immediately
to
act
on
the
charge
instead.
the
state
agency
notified
the
eeoc
of
its
intention
in
three
different
ways.
first,
the
colorado
agency
had
previously
entered
into
a
work-sharing
agreement
with
the
eeoc
in
which
the
state
a
greed
in
advance
that
these
procedures
would
be
followed
with
respect
to
a
charge
such
as
this
one,
when
it
was
first
received
by
the
eeoc.
second,
the
eeoc
contacted
the
state
agency
on
the
day
that
it
first
received
the
charge,
and
on
that
day
received
oral
confirmation
that
these
procedures
should
be
followed
with
respect
to
the
charge.
third,
pursuant
to
the
work-sharing
agreement,
the
eeoc
sent
a
copy
of
the
charge
to
the
state
agency
along
with
a
transmittal
form.
that
was
four
days
after
it
received
the
charge.
five
days
after
that,
the
state
agency
sent
a
copy
of
that
transmittal
form
back
to
the
eeoc,
on
which
it
indicated
that
it
declined
to
initially
process
the
charge.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that
they
declined
to
initially
process
the
charge.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
all
it
said
on
that
form.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
pursuant
to
the
work-sharing
agreement,
they
reserved
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--precisely.
and
that's
where
we
disagree.
the
district
court
agreed
with
respondent
that
under
these
facts,
the
charge
had
not
been
timely
filed.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
both
of
the
courts
applied
the
300-day
limitations
period
rejecting
the
respondent's
alternative
argument,
but
they
both
concluded
that
the
charge
had
not
been
filed
with
the
eeoc
within
that
300
days
because
the
60-day
deferral
period
of
section
706(e)
took
it
outside
the
300
days.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
they
both
rejected
our
contention
that
there
had
been
a
termination
prior
to
that.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
say
there
is
a
termination
even
though
the
state
agency
has
nominally
reserved
jurisdiction,
if
it
wants,
to
act
after
the
eeoc
has
acted.
there
is
no
indication--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
state
agency
has
informed
us,
and
i
believe
it's
also
reflected
in
their
amicus
brief
filed,
that
four
or
five
times
a
year
they
reactivate
a
charge.
they
typically
only
do
that
when--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--because
the
termination
does
not
require,
we
believe,
a
complete
surrender,
and
there
is
really
no
reason
that
it
should.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
the
word
"termination"...
and
that's
where
we
disagree
with
respondent...
we
don't
believe
that
"end"
must
be
a
permanent--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
means
the
end,
but
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
be
irrevocable,
and
it
be
final.
it's
to
cease.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
it
depends
on
what
is
being
terminated.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
precisely
that.
but
it
depends
on
what
type
of
activity
is
being
terminated.
something
like
a
life...
by
the
nature
of
the
activity
being
terminated,
can
only
cease
once.
other
things,
such
as
proceedings
are
on-going
and
they
can
by
their
nature
cease
more
than
one
time.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that
is
right.
but
the
word
"termination"
includes
both
a
suspension,
as
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
and
a
final
disposition.
and
congress
chose
a
word
which
included
both.
that
word
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
underlying
the
deferral
requirement.
but
we
believe
that
there
is--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
it
did
commence.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
they
declined
to
initially
process
the
charge.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
it
was
filed
with
them.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
love
v.
pullman,
there
is
not
question.
the
same
procedure
was
followed
here,
in
fact,
that
was
followed
in
love
v.
pullman.
there
was
an
oral
confirmation;
it
was
the
same
agency
involved.
so
there
is
really
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
commencement
of
proceedings
within
the
meaning
of
section
706(c).
initially
processing
the
charges,
which
is
something
that
they
declined
to
do,
is
something
after
the
commencement
of
the
state
proceedings.
we
believe
that
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
relied
on
its
ruling
that
there
can
not
be
termination
proceedings
without
a
complete
and
irrevocable
surrendering
of
jurisdiction
was
incorrect.
we
also
believe
that
there
is
equally
no
merit
to
respondent's
ultimate
contention,
and
that
is
that
their
300-day
limitation
period
does
not
apply
in
the
first
instance
in
this
case
because
the
charge
was
not
timely
filed
with
the
state
agency
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
turning
to
the
first,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrues,
we
believe,
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
deferral
requirement
established
by
section
706(c).
the
court
of
appeals
when
under
its
reading
of
termination
requires
state
abdication
authority
instead
of
deference
to
state
authority,
and
would
invite
needless
sixty-day
delays
instead
of
promoting
expeditious
processing
of
claims.
indeed,
the
decision
threatens
to
undermine
the
operation
of
the
harmonious
and
efficient
and
cooperative
relationship
now
existing
between
federal
and
state
agencies,
and
precisely
the
relationship
that
congress
hoped
to
foster
in
enacting
title
vii,
and
which
now
exists
thanks
to
the
work-sharing
agreements.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
we
think
there
is
no
question
that
congress
hoped
to--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--to
the
extent
that
the
federal
government
is
doing
some
of
the
processing,
it
is
pursuant
to
the
agreement
that
the
states
have
the
upper
hand
in
voluntarily
entering
into
these
agreements.
the
states--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
statute
really
reflects
that
congress
chose
to
encourage
the
states
by
a
carrot,
and
not
by
a
stick.
by
encouraging
them,
by
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
act
first,
and
not
by
requiring
them
to
act,
and
not
by
saying
that
they
had
to
finally
dispose
of
a
claim
by
a
certain
time,
or
indeed,
that
to
take
advantage
of
an
efficient
work-sharing
relationship,
the
states
would
have
to
abdicate
their
authority.
it's
really
contrary
and
perverse
to
the
congressional
purpose
to
assume
that
congress
was
somehow
forcing
the
states
to
act.
we
think
that
instead
they
were
encouraging
them
by
giving
them
a
head
start...
a
carrot,
but
not
a
stick.
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
two
provisions,
of
paragraphs
(c)
and
(e)
of
section
706,
are
uncommonly
complex.
they
are
the
product,
we
admit,
of
a
hard-fought
compromise
fashioned
by
senators
dirksen
and
mansfield
in
order
to
overcome
a
filibuster
that
threatened
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
competing
policy
concerns
reflected
in
the
statutory
language
are
evident
throughout
the
legislative
debates,
and
they
are
principally
two.
first,
on
the
one
hand,
there
were
those
such
as
senator
dirksen
who
wanted
to
insure
that
state
agencies
had
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
address
appointment
discriminations
at
the
local
level.
on
the
other
hand,
there
were
those
who
did
not
want
the
force
of
a
federal
non-discrimination
remedy
to
depend
ultimately
on
the
effectiveness
of
state
law.
the
balance
was
carefully
struck
by
the
statutory
language
they
enacted.
the
language
provides
a
state
agency
with
that
prior
opportunity
to
process
a
charge
first,
by
giving
it
in
effect--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--they
wanted
them
to
process
promptly,
but
in
this
case
they
extended
the
limitations
period
in
order
to--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--give
the
state
agencies
their
chance.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
but
that
really
goes
to
the
second
point.
they
claim--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
i
will.
we
believe,
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
oscar
mayer,
that
there
only
have
to
be
two
things
for
there
to
be
a
state
deferral
agency
within
the
meaning
of
section
706(c)
to
require
that
that
deferral
take
place.
one--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i
believe
there
are
a
handful...
four
or
five
that
do
not.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right,
that
still
do
not.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
unless
the
state
agency
terminates
the
proceedings
prior
to
the
270
days,
in
which
case
it
would
be
the
thirty
days--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
congress
has
gotten
exactly
what
they
wanted.
congress
provided
for
an
extended
limitations
period
when
there
was
a
state
deferral
agency.
so
the
only
question
is
whether
there
is
such
an
agency.
and
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
charge
might
be
untimely
under
state
law--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right.
whether
there's
a
state
law
prohibiting
the
alleged
appointment
discrimination
practice,
and
whether
there
is
a
state
agency
authorized
to
remedy
such
practice.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
yes,
there
was.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
and
we
don't
resist
that
conclusion
here,
the
state
limitations
period
is
not
self-executing,
and
it
is
subject
to
waiver.
it
is
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
the
entire
purpose
of
the
deferral
requirement
is
to
allow
the
state
agency
for
itself
to
decide
what
is
the
impact
for
the
failure
to
meet
a
limitation
period...
not
to
have
the
federal
agency
decide.
not
to
have
the
federal
agency
decide
the
effectiveness
of
state
law,
but
to
allow
the
state
agency
itself
to
apply
its
own
law.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
as
it
isn't
in
this
case.
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
and
that
therefore
there
was
residual
jurisdiction,
and
no
termination.
senator
dirksen
and
others--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
senator
dirksen
and
these
others
objected
vehemently
to
the
prior
version
of
the
bill,
which
would
have
had
the
federal
government
investigating
and
deciding
whether
or
not
there
was
an
effective
state
law,
and
an
effective
state
agency.
the
prior
purpose
of
deferral,
and
the
deferral
requirement,
section
706(c)
was
to
avoid
that
situation.
but
respondent
invites
the
federal
government
to
undertake
just
such
an
intrusive
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
still
a
state
agency,
because
the
limitation
period
is
not
met.
that
varies
widely
among
the
states
upon
what
is
the
significance
of
a
charge
not
being
untimely,
and
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
untimely.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
congress
did
not
purport
to
dictate
what
states
decided
to
do.
what
is
being
done
here
is
not
at
all
an
abdication.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
they
wanted
two
things.
they
wanted
to
encourage
the
states
to
do
so,
not
to
require
the
states
to
do
so.
and
in
fact,
the
relationship
we
have
here
works
quite
well.
the
state
handle
a
lot
of
the
charges
first.
there
is
an
overabundance
of
charges,
and
the
state
and
federal
agencies
are
trying
to
work
hand-in-hand
to
deal
with
these
in
an
expeditious
way,
and
not
to
have
a
work-duplication
agreement,
but
a
work-sharing
agreement.
the
only
purpose
of
the
state
in
this
case,
reserving
its
jurisdiction,
really,
is
to
avoid
a
total
abdication
of
authority
and
to
avoid
the
untenable
result
that
would
be
produced
if
after
complete
surrender
of
jurisdiction,
the
eeoc
subsequently
determined
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction.
respondents
are
really
ignoring
reality
when
they
suggest
that
the
eeoc
and
the
state
are
somehow
conspiring
in
devious
ways
to
subject
them
to
multiple
jurisdiction
and
to
extend
the
limitations
period.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
come
up
with
an
efficient
and
expeditious
way
to
share
work.
the
state
agency
in
colorado
is
not
routinely
processing
the
charges
after
the
eeoc
has
acted.
they
are
simply
nominally
holding
their
jurisdiction
afterwards
in
order
to
avoid
what
would
be
an
untenable
position.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
because
they
believe
it
is
important
to
take
care
of
that
rare
case.
it's
the
states
that
insist
on
this
provision
of
the
work-sharing
agreement,
which
really
i
think
illustrates
quite
well
that
it's
not
the
federal
government
dominating
the
field.
it's
the
states,
who
are
playing
a
very
active
role
in
protecting
their
jurisdiction.
and
it
would
be
a
little
odd,
in
my--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--you
investigate
it
first
when
you
receive
it
first.
we'll
investigate
it
first--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
it
gives
the
states
the
option.
it
is
received,
and
the
state
proceedings
commence.
then
the
state
can
decide,
and
the
eeoc
can
decide,
and
not
force
the
states.
congress
didn't
intend
to
force
the
states
to
act
on
all
these
charges
finally--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
that's
where
we
disagree.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
said
that
you
were
given
the
opportunity
to
act
first
and
to
process
the
charge
first.
you
were
given
a
head
start.
but
you
don't
have--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right,
but--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--if
the
states...
and
the
states
have
the
authority...
and
that's
what
congress
gave
them.
congress
gave
them
that
leverage.
it's
that
leverage
they've
exercised
with
the
work-sharing
agreements.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
that's
not--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
not
precisely
true.
congress
wrote
section
706(e)
a
little
more
fine-tunely
than
that.
congress
said,
"it's
300
days,
or
thirty
days
after
the
termination
of
state
proceedings,
whichever
is
earlier.
"
so
as
soon
as
the
state
terminates
it
proceedings,
the
complainant
only
has
thirty
days
to
file
with
the
eeoc.
that
might
be
much
less
than
300
days;
that
may
be
less
than
180
days.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
300-day
limitation
period
does
not
apply
in
every
case.
it's
300
days
or
thirty
days
after
the
termination
of
state
proceedings.
our
broad
view,
which
we
believe
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
the
meaning
of
the
termination,
would
trigger
much
more
readily,
which
congress
accounted
for,
that
earlier
period.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
simply,
if
we
think
the
word
"terminate"
means
"to
cease",
and
whether
a
cessation
necessarily
is
permanent
and
irrevocable
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
activity
being
ceased.
a
life,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
is
something
which
by
its
nature,
when
you
terminate
it...
which
i
think
is
how
a
lot
of
people
think
of
the
term...
can
not
be
ceased
more
than
once.
but
a
proceeding
is
an
ongoing
process,
and
it
is
something
which
can
be
ceased.
and
it
is
not
necessarily--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
could
be
that
the
district
court
proceedings
have
been
terminated,
but
there
might
be
more
going
on
in
the
process.
and
the
statue
refers
to
such
proceedings;
the
proceedings
which
have
already
been
initiated.
and
we
think
if
you
look
to
the
purposes
underlying,
it
simply
leads
to
a
result
which
is
contrary
to
exactly
what
congress
was
going
after--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right,
but
we
believe
that
word
includes
an
ambiguity,
particularly
with
respect
to
what
is
being
terminated.
contrary
to
respondent's
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
does
not
dictate
that
the
stop
must
be
irrevocable.
and
the
words
"jurisdiction
authority"
do
not
appear
anywhere
in
the
relevant
portion
of
the
provision.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
there
were
four
purposes
to
the
deferral
requirement,
one
of
which
would
not
be
furthered
by
the
court
of
appeals
construction,
and
three
of
which
would
be
completely
defeated.
first,
congress
plainly
wanted
to
give
states
the
opportunity
to
begin
to
process
the
charge
first.
that
opportunity
is
provided
whether
or
not
a
termination
is
a
complete
and
irrevocable
surrender
of
jurisdiction.
second,
congress
wanted
to
defer
to
state
agencies
to
give
them
a
chance
to
use
their
authority
and
give
them
a
meaningful
role.
respondent's
proposed
construction,
however,
would
turn
that
on
its
head.
it
would
require
the
relinquishment
of
state
authority.
to
achieve
efficiency,
states
would
be
required
to
abdicate
their
authority.
third,
congress
wanted
to
promote
expeditious
processing--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
to
take
advantage
of
what
they
believe
is
an
efficient
work-sharing
arrangement--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
congress
didn't,
we
think,
preclude
the
states--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
true,
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
preclude
them
from
setting
up
this
kind
of
arrangement,
which
is
a
very
sensible
and
efficient
way
to
have
these
things
work.
we
believe
that
the
language
is
not
so
inflexible
to
prevent
the
states
from
entering
into
these
without
also
agreeing
to
completely
abdicate
their
authority.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
and
whether
one
is
willing,
as
we
believe
one
should
be
to
agree
that
there
is
sufficient
ambiguity
in
the
provision,
particularly
with
respect
to
what
it
applies
to...
to
look
at
the
purposes
in
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
deferral
requirement.
once
you
look
at
those
purposes,
it
becomes
clear
that
it
is
really
the
only
sensible
way.
rather
than
undoing
work-sharing
agreements
which
exist
throughout
the
country
they
are
working
really
quite
well...
it's
unusual
that
federal
and
state
coordination
works
so
well.
the
work-sharing
agreement
do.
it's
precisely
what
the
dirksen-mansfield
compromise--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
states
have
tremendous
back
logs
as
well.
i
think
about
one-third
of
the
claims
are
first
received
by
the
states.
and
as
the
amicus
brief
filed,
they
are
very
much
in
support.
there
is
really
no
resulting
federal
domination
in
the
field.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
they're
sharing
work.
they're
not
duplicating
work.
the
result
is
not
just
work--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it's
really
just
a
game
of
words
with
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
state
law:
whether
they
call
it
a
relinquishment
of
jurisdiction
or
whether
they
call
it
a
reopening.
in
effect,
that's
all
the
states
have
done
here.
they
have
been
explicit
about
it
rather
than
trying
to
hide
the
ball.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
issue
that
we're
really
talking
about
is
whether
on
section
706(c)
the
state
has
to
completely
abdicate
authority
in
order
to
terminate.
the
real
result
of
the
state
having
to
do
that--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
implications
in
this
case,
given
the
facts,
is
that
the
charge
would
in
fact
be
rendered
untimely
and
not
meet
the
300
days.
but
the
implication
in
the
broad
class
of
cases
would
be
that
every
single
instance,
whatever
the
state
wanted
to
call
it...
a
reopening...
but
somehow
reserved
to
itself
some
jurisdiction.
the
eeoc
would
have
to
sit
on
a
charge
for
sixty
days.
the
state
would
be
unwilling
to
act,
and
the
eeoc
would
be
unable
to
act.
and
in
certain
cases,
because
of
when
the
charge
was
filed,
such
as
a
case
like
this
one,
that
wasteful
day
would
also
have
the
additional
perverse
result
of
rendering
the
charges
untimely.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that
is
always
true.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
if
they
filed
it
after
the
second
day,
there
would
be
no
problem.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
not
under
respondent's
view,
of
course.
respondent's
say
that
it
would
have
to
be
under
eighty
days,
because
if
it's
untimely
under
state
law,
the
300-day
limitations
period--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
then
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
question,
though--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--is
what
if
they
don't?
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
and
when
the
congress
provides
for
300
days,
as
we
believe
they
have
done--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--congress
didn't
write
a
statute
which
said
that
everything
after
240
is
untimely.
so
we're
in
that
gray
area,
and
now
we
need
to
decide
when
the
filing--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
we
don't
think.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
if
the
court
permits,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
i
just
have
a
few
points
on
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
the
effect
of
the
work-sharing
agreement
in
this
case
is
not
to
lengthen
the
statute
limitations.
it
is
to
allow
the
charge
to
be
filed
immediately
with
the
eeoc,
and
to
avoid
the
sixty-day
delay.
whether
the
work-sharing
agreement
precludes
the
application
of
the
300-day
limitations
period
is
an
issue
which
respondent
has
not
clearly
raised
in
this
case,
but
is
raised
in
another
case
pending
before
the
court,
on
petitioner
certiorari
dixon
v.
westinghouse.
second,
not
every
charge
submitted
to
the
eeoc
first
is
filed
with
the
eeoc
first.
under
the
work-sharing
agreement,
those
charges
originating
one-hundred
miles
outside
of
denver
are,
page
52(a):
"filed,
processed
first
by
the
state
agency.
"
there
are
other
exceptions
outlined
on
page
48(a)
for
charges
that
are
received
first
by
the
eeoc
that
are
nonetheless
first
processed
by
the
state
agency.
the
state
agencies
in
this
case
have
really
done
nothing
more
than
reserve
nominal
jurisdiction
based
on
the
initial
filing
to
reopen
the
matter
later.
they
are
not
going
to
act,
if
at
all,
under
the
work-sharing
agreement,
until
after
the
eeoc
has
acted.
indeed,
under
colorado
law,
under,
i
think,
provision
24-34306-11,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
respondent's
petition,
a
colorado
agency
is
without
jurisdiction
to
act
180
days
after
the
charge
is
filed
with
the
state
agency
if
they
haven't
before
then
noticed
a
hearing.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
states
must
surrender
their
jurisdiction,
but
then
somehow
says
that
that
doesn't
prevent
them
from
reopening
it
later,
you'll
really
only
be
forcing
the
states
to
use
different
words.
in
effect,
that
is
what
the
states
have
done
here.
we
don't
believe
that
the
word
"terminate"
precludes
the
states
from
doing
so.
on
the
second
issue,
as
respondent
concedes,
the
untimeliness
under
colorado
law
did
not
deprive
the
colorado
agency
of
jurisdiction
to
process
the
charge.
hence,
it
must
be
a
deferral
agency
within
the
meaning
of
section
706(c).
the
court
made
this
clear
in
oscar
mayer
and
related
contexts,
at
page
763,
when
it
said
that
the
state
limitations
period
did
not
preclude
state
proceedings
from
being
commenced
under
the
related
provisions
of
the
age
discrimination
employment
act.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
further
questions.
