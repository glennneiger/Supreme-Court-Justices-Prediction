justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
this
case,
an
illinois
state
court
judge
exercised
his
authority
under
state
law
to
demote
and
then
discharge
a
probation
officer
working
under
his
supervision.
the
probation
officer
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
for
damages
under
section
1983
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
alleging
that
she
had
been
demoted
and
discharge
on
account
of
her
sex.
the
federal
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
defendant
judge
on
the
ground
that
he
was
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
for
his
actions.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
in
the
past
we
have
held
that
judges
are
absolutely
immune
for
their
acts
of
adjudication.
a
decision
to
demote
or
discharge
a
subordinate
employee,
however,
is
an
administrative
or
executive
act
not
included
within
the
judicial
function
itself.
in
this
context
the
traditional
justification
for
absolute
immunity
does
not
apply
and
we
hold
there
is
no
absolute
immunity
from
suit
for
damages
in
these
circumstances.
the
judgment
is
unanimous,
justice
blackmun
has
joined
all
but
part
2
of
the
opinion.
