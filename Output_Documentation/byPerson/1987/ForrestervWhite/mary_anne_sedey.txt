ms.
mary
anne
sedey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
cynthia
forrester,
sued
her
employer,
judge
howard
lee
white,
for
intentional
sex
discrimination
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983,
when
he
demoted
and
then
discharged
her
from
her
position
as
director
of
a
juvenile
court
diversion
program
and
juvenile
probation
officer
for
the
jersey
county
illinois
circuit
court.
the
issue
for
decision
in
this
court
is
whether
a
state
court
judge
is
engaged
in
a
judicial
act
and
therefore
protected
from
a
suit
for
damages
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
when
he
makes
a
personnel
decision
regarding
a
court
employee.
we
submit
that
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
bars
cynthia
forrester's
claim
for
damages
expands
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
far
beyond
the
limits
created
by
this
court's
decisions
and
beyond
the
scope
necessary
to
effectuate
its
legitimate
historical
purposes.
we
ask
this
court
to
rule
that
a
personnel
decision
is
not
a
judicial
act,
and
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
does
not
bar
a
suit
for
damages
under
section
1983
for
employment
discrimination.
this
court's
prior
decisions
clearly
articulate
what
is
a
judicial
act.
i
think
it's
clear
from
those
decisions
that
a
judge's
decision
to
fire
a
court
employee
does
not
fit
within
the
category
of
acts
which
this
court
has
defined
as
judicial
acts.
the
first
principle
in
trying
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
act
is
a
judicial
act
is
that
that
determination
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
characteristics
of
the
act,
not
the
status
of
the
actor.
in
other
words,
the
fact
that
the
person
is
a
judge
does
not
make
every
act
that
that
person
engages
in
a
judicial
act.
this
court
established
that
principle
in
a
case
decided
in
1880,
ex
parte
virginia,
a
case
in
which
the
facts
were
quite
similar
to
the
facts
of
the
case
of
forrester
versus
white.
in
addition,
this
court
has
held
explicitly
that
judicial
acts
are
acts
of
adjudication.
and
i'd
direct
the
court's
attention
to
its
decision
in
supreme
court
of
virginia
v.
consumers
union,
a
1980
case
in
which
this
court
ruled
that
even
an
official
action
taken
by
a
state
court
judge
pursuant
to
explicit
statutory
authority
is
not
a
judicial
act
when
that
judge
acts
not
on
parties
litigant,
and
when
the
act
does
not
arise
out
of
a
controversy
which
is
before
the
judge
for
adjudication.
i
think
that
these
cases
together
stand
for
the
proposition
that
judges
are
protected
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
only
when
they
are
engaged
in
acts
of
adjudication,
by
that,
we
mean
acts
connected
with
a
case,
a
controversy,
a
matter
before
a
judge
for
a
decision
by
him
or
her
acting
as
an
adjudicator.
that
principle
has
also
been
restated
in
two
other
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
the
1978
decision
in
butz
v.
economou
and
the
court's
1985
decision
in
cleavinger
v.
saxner.
in
the
butz
case,
this
court
held
that
hearing
officers
in
federal
administrative
agencies
are
entitled
to
judicial
immunity
when
they
are
hearing
cases
and
controversies.
in
that
decision,
this
court
noted
that
the
officials
in
those
cases
issued
subpoenas,
ruled
on
proffers
of
evidence,
make
and
recommend
decisions,
and
these
are
acts
which
are
integral
elements
of
the
adjudicatory
process.
again,
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
hearing
officers
in
these
federal
administrative
agencies
were
going
to
be
protected
by
the
doctrine
in
connection
with
were
acts
of
adjudication.
in
cleavinger
v.
saxner,
1985
case
decided
by
this
court,
the
question
arose
whether
prison
officials
acting
as
a
disciplinary
committee
holding
disciplinary
proceedings
with
regard
to
prisoners
were
engaged
in
judicial
acts
and
therefore
protected
from
suit
by
these
prisoners
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
and
again,
in
that
case,
this
court
held
as
recently
as
1985
that
when
the
attributes
of
judicial
proceeding
are
missing,
that
there
is
no
judicial
immunity.
the
decisions
of
this
court
clearly
hold
that
a
judicial
act
is
an
act
of
adjudication,
an
act
connected
with
or
arising
out
of
a
case
before
a
judge
for
adjudication.
the
judge's
acts
at
issue
in
this
case
were
two
decisions;
a
decision
to
demote
an
employee,
and
a
decision
to
discharge
an
employee,
basically
personnel
decisions
about
a
court
employee.
those
decisions
do
not
fit
within
the
category
of
acts
which
this
court
has
ruled
are
judicial
acts.
personnel
decisions,
no
matter
what
the
nature--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--it's
our
opinion,
your
honor,
that
it
would
not
be,
because
it
is
not
an
act
of
adjudication.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
under
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion,
that
would
be
a
judicial
act.
under
the
rule
which
we
propose
that
this
court
adopt
here,
it
would
not
be
a
judicial
act
because
it
wouldn't
be
arising
from
a
case
or
a
controversy
before
the
judge
for
adjudication.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
well,
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
would
say--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--all
right,
that
would
be
an
administrative
act,
not
an
act
of
adjudication
because
it
doesn't
arise
out
of
any
kind
of
matter
before
the
judge.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
i
think
it
would
depend
on
how
the
attack
was
made
on
the
firing
of
the
master.
in
other
words,
if
the
master
himself
brought
suit--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--the
fact
that
she
was
a
woman
would
not
be
enough,
no,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
i
think
we
do.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
what
we
have
here
is
an
action
under
section
1983.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
everything
that
this
woman
did,
assisted
the
judge--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--she
was
assisting
the
judge
in
carrying
out
his
judicial
functions,
but
the
judge's
decision
to
terminate
her
was
not
judicial,
it
was
administrative.
it
didn't
arise
out
of
any
case
or
controversy
before
the
judge
for
decision.
and
that's
the
distinction
here
that
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt,
that
an
act
that
arises
out
of
a
case
or
a
controversy
before
a
judge
for
decision
is
a
judicial
act,
an
act
of
adjudication.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
i
believe
she
would,
because
i
believe
that
that's
a
decision
about
assigning
work,
which
is
a
personnel
decision.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
litigant
who
was
coming
before
her
for
a
decision
of
a
case
tried
to
attack
that
decision,
i
don't
think
that
the
litigant
could
attack
that
decision
because
it's
a
judicial
act
viz
a
viz
the
litigant.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
in
theory,
i
believe
that
that
judge
would
have
a
claim,
because
again,
with
regard
to
that
judge's
work
assignment,
it
is
essentially
a
personnel
decision,
an
administrative
decision
of
the
chief
judge
to
assign
certain
work
to
that
individual.
on
the
other
hand,
if
an
attorney
who
was
going
to
appear
before
the
court
wanted
to
attack
that
decision,
i
believe
that
that
would
not
lie
because
again--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--viz
a
viz
the
litigant,
it's
an
act
of
adjudication.
so
i
think
that's
the
important
distinction
here,
mr.
justice.
essentially,
personnel
decisions
are
administrative
acts.
there
are
many
acts
that
a
judge
takes,
any
judge
at
any
level,
which
are
official
acts,
acts
assigned
to
the
judge
as
a
part
of
his
or
her
official
functions,
acts
that
perhaps
are
in
fact
authorized
by
statute,
but
as
this
court
has
ruled
in
ex
parte
virginia
and
consumers
union,
the
fact
that
an
act
is
an
official
act
of
the
judge,
the
fact
that
an
act
is
carried
out
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
does
not
make
it
a
judicial
act
for
purposes
of
judicial
immunity.
our
position
that
it
is
only
acts
of
adjudication
which
are
protected
by
judicial
immunity
also
derives
additional
support
from
the
doctrine's
historical
development.
the
earliest
cases--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--i
think
it
is
because
it
arises
in
connection
with
the
judge
carrying
out
his
judicial
function,
the
function
of
adjudication,
which
is
a
different
matter
i
think
than
the
matter
of
an
employment
decision
to
hire,
fire,
demote,
whatever,
which
i
believe
is
a
different
kind
of
an
act.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
well,
for
instance,
i
don't
think
that
a
litigant
who
felt
that
a
judge
was
discriminating
between
two
different
litigants
in
similar
law
suits
could
bring
an
action
attacking
the
judge's
decision
in
her
case.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
right.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
is
it
by
a
litigant,
somebody
who
complains
about
the
kind
of
advice?
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
then
i
believe
that
the
probation
officer
would
have
derivative
judicial
immunity
to
suit
by
a
litigant
who
was
unhappy
about
the
advice
that
she
was
giving
the
judge
in
connection
with
decisions
about
say
probation
or
sentencing,
that
kind
of
thing.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
correct.
the
judge
would
have
absolutely--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--i
think
he
has
qualified
immunity
exactly
the
same
as
any
other
governmental
official
would
have
with
respect
to
administrative
acts,
in
other
words,
qualified
good
faith
immunity
similar
to
that
provided
to
every
governmental
official.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
yes.
no.
not
if
he
fired
her
for
making
noise
during
a
decision
in
a
case.
i
believe
that
the
hypothetical
had
to
do
with
the
issuance
of
some
kind
of
contempt
order
in
connection
with
the
proceeding,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
contempt
order
in
the
context
of
a
hearing
is
different
from
the
administrative
decision
to
fire
that
employee
for
her
conduct
or
his
conduct
in
the
courtroom.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
exactly,
the
fact
that--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--the
latter,
the
fact
that
it's
a
contempt
order
issued
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding,
rather
than
an
administrative
personnel
decision
issued
in
the
judge's
capacity
as
the
employer
to
discharge
the
employee.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
yes,
i
believe
there
would
be.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
correct.
that
would
be
our
position.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
then,
justice,
i
would
say
that
he
has
a
good
defense
to
the
law
suit.
but
the
cause
of
action
for
money
damages
is
not
barred.
it
is
simply
that
he
has
a
good
defense,
as
any
other
governmental
official
would
be
required
to
put
on
a
good
defense.
that
judge
in
that
situation
could
do
that
as
well.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
the
merits
of
the
jury's
determination
here
that
there
was
sex
discrimination
or
the
merits
of
the
judge's
decision
to
discharge
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we're
talking
about
the
question
of
whether
the
petitioner
has
a
remedy
at
all.
whether
she
can
bring
the
claim.
and
i
would
remind
the
court
that
even
an
action
against
a
judge
for
injunctive
relief
is
not
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
so
that--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--we
are,
that's
correct.
again,
i
would
suggest
that
the
historical
underpinnings
of
this
doctrine
provide
strong
support
for
our
position
that
suits
about
employment
decisions
are
not
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
no.
the
judge
could
and
should
discharge
that
person
if
the
judge
has
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
doing
so.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
right.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
he
could
have
fired
her
if
he
had
a
legitimate
reason
not
based
on
her
sex.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
he
could
put
on
a
defense
to
her
law
suit
that
said
that
it
wasn't
discrimination,
and
that's
what
he
did
here.
but
a
jury
determined
that
it
was.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
he
has
the
same
protection
that
any
other--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--well,
i
think
the
judge
could
discharge
that
individual
regardless
of
their
sex?
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
absolutely.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
in
this
case--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--that's
right.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
one
of
the
differences.
but
the
other
difference
is
that
in
that
case,
the
judge's
decision
was
not
based
on
that
individual's
sex,
race,
religion,
age,
national
origin.
in
that
case,
the
judge's
decision
was
a
legitimate
non-discriminatory
one.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
no.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
no,
because
a
man
has
a
cause
of
action
for
sex
discrimination,
just
like
a
woman
has.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
in
any
case,
certainly.
and
the
judge
would
have
a
real
strong
defense
in
that
case,
i
think,
that
the
decision
was
a
legitimate
one
based
on
the
employee's
behavior,
not
based
on
the
employee's
sex.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
no.
i
think
that
what
qualifies--
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
--i
think
that
the
qualified
immunity
would
simply
provide
him
with
an
opportunity
to
say
that
he
didn't
realize
that
the
conduct
that
he's
charged
with
violated
a
statute,
and
i
don't
really
think
it
would
do
him
much
good.
qualified
immunity
in
a
discrimination
case
is
not
of
much
assistance
to
a
public
official.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
exactly
correct,
it
would.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
i
think
that
that
litigant
could
not
bring
a
suit
in
connection
with
that
decision.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
but
viz
a
viz
the
litigant,
it's
a
judicial
act,
it's
an
act
connected
with
the
proceedings
that
the
litigant
is
involved
in.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
i
would
not
allow
the
litigant
to
sue
because
of
judicial
immunity.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
correct,
because
viz
a
viz
the
judge
whose
unhappy
about
the
assignment,
there's
nothing
going
on
with
regard
to
her
that
has
to
do
with
the
adjudication
of
any
particular
controversy,
it's
simply
an
administrative
decision
to
assign
her
work
which
she
believes
was
made
on
the
basis
of
her
sex.
and
in
that
situation,
i
don't
believe
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
would
bar
the
suit.
i've
reserved
some
of
my
time,
so
i'll
sit
down
for
the
time
being.
thank
you.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
thank
you.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
threat
which
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
was
developed
to
protect
judges
against
was
in
fact
the
threat
of
lawsuits
against
judges
by
litigants
who
were
dissatisfied
with
the
outcome
of
a
case
or
a
controversy
that
that
judge
was
deciding.
and
basically,
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
common
law
wanted
to
protect
judges
against
that
kind
of
threat;
one
was
to
assure
that
judges
would
feel
safe
making
principled,
independent
judicial
decisions,
free
of
the
threat
of
that
kind
of
litigation
by
parties
who
were
dissatisfied
with
the
result
in
their
cases;
and
in
addition,
to
protect
final
judgments
from
collateral
attack,
again,
collateral
attack
by
litigants
who
were
dissatisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
cases
that
were
before
the
judge
for
adjudication,
for
decision.
judicial
immunity
is
an
absolute
immunity.
most
governmental
officials
have
only
a
qualified
immunity
and
it
is
the
function
that
judges
uniquely
carry
out
in
this
system
of
adjudicating
cases
or
controversies
and
the
threat
which
is
unique
to
judges
of
litigation
by
litigants
unhappy
with
the
determination
of
their
cases
which
justifies
the
granting
of
judicial
immunity.
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
all
the
absolute
immunity
cases
have
adopted
a
functional
approach
to
absolute
immunities.
only
where
there's
some
special
function,
some
unique
function
that
requires
protection
is
absolute
immunity
extended.
and
only
when
the
governmental
official
who
is
protected
by
absolute
immunity
is
engaged
in
that
function
is
judicial
immunity
a
bar
to
suit.
the
protection
extends
no
farther
than
the
justification
that
warrants
the
absolute
immunity.
since
it
is
the
adjudicatory
function
which
is
the
function
to
be
protected
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
adjudication
of
disputes
is
the
thing
that
judges
do
which
must
be
protected.
they
are
similar
to
any
other
governmental
official
in
hiring,
firing,
disciplining,
assigning
work
to
employees.
those
are
administrative
acts.
all
governmental
officials
are
required
to
carry
out
those
kinds
of
acts.
as
an
administrator,
a
judge
is
required
to
carry
out
those
acts.
there's
nothing
unique
about
the
judicial
function
that
makes
a
judge
any
more
likely
to
be
sued
say
for
employment
discrimination,
than
any
other
governmental
official.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
we
requested
reinstatement
in
this
case,
justice
white.
and
the
trial
court
denied
reinstatement.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
correct.
and
in
fact,
cynthia
forrester
is
like
many
judicial
employees
that
really
her
only
remedy
is
going
to
be
damages.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
the
back
pay
was
approximately
$26,000.
there
were
some
additional
amounts
for
the
costs
of
seeking
employment
and
compensation
for
humiliation,
embarrassment,
pain
and
suffering.
but
those
were
the
elements.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
in
fact,
there
is
an
indemnification
statute
in
illinois
and
judge
white
would
never
have
paid
one
penny
of
that
monetary
award.
the
state
of
illinois
would
have
paid
that
award.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
a
state
could
make
that
choice
to
not
indemnify
judges
against
these
kinds
of
suits.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
that's
correct.
and
i
think
one
important
point
to
recall
is
that
congress
decided
to
create
this
remedy
under
1983.
and
no
decision
of
this
court
has
ever
suggested
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
judges
to
be
subject
to
suit
under
1983.
the
most
this
court
has
ever
said
is
that
when
congress
passed
1983,
it
did
not
intend
to
abrogate
the
common
law
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed.
and
clearly,
the
common
law
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
did
not
anticipate
barring
suits
by
employees
for
employment
discrimination.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
1983
provides
a
general
remedy
for
various
kinds
of
violations
of
constitutional
rights
and
this
court
has
certainly
found
in
the
interim
that
1983
can
be
used
to
attack
sex
discrimination
in
employment.
ms.
mary
anne
sedey
yes.
there
is
an
indemnification
statute
that's
much
broader
than
just
judges.
thank
you.
