justice
stevens
may
i
give
you
another
example,
somewhat
like
justice
marshall's,
i
guess.
supposing
you
have
in
a
given
county
in
a
state
judicial
system,
a
chief
judge
who
has
the
assignment
power
to
assign
cases.
and
he
decides
to
assign
a
woman
judge
to
the
criminal
calendar
for
the
month
of
october.
and
she
brings
a
lawsuit
and
says
you
did
it
only
because
you
don't
like
women,
you
like
them
to
have
the
undesirable
assignments.
would
she
have
a
claim?
justice
stevens
supposing
in
a
multi-judge
appellate
court,
one
of
the
judges
didn't
like
his
opinion
assignments,
and
he
claimed
that
the
chief
judge
was
just
assigning
him
because
he
didn't
like
his
religion
or
his
race
or
his
sex.
would
he
have
a
claim?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
pursue
justice
scalia's
example
a
little
further.
say
a
prosecutor
adopted
a
policy
that
he
would
hire
only
white
males.
he
announced
it
publicly,
this
is
all
i
want,
because
my
experience
is
they're
the
best
prosecutors.
and
that
could
not
be
challenged
in
court?
justice
stevens
but
to
be
challenged
in
an
injunction
suit
is
the
only
you
could
do
it?
justice
stevens
so
then
what
he
does,
he
just
says,
i'll
repeal
that
policy,
then
he
just
continues
along
doing
exactly
the
same
thing,
and
he
couldn't
be--
justice
stevens
--are
you
saying
that
this
particular
plaintiff
could
bring
an
action
for
reinstatement
and
get
her
job
back?
justice
stevens
if
she
proved
that
the
only
reason
for
the
discharge
was
this
sex
discrimination?
justice
stevens
but
you
answer
on
my
male
whites
only
prosecutor
was
well,
he
could
get
equitable
relief,
but
now
you're
saying,
well
we
can't
give
that
either.
justice
stevens
well,
say
you
had
right
before
the
change
of
administration,
you
had
five
women
and
five
black
assistant
prosecutors
and
ten
whites.
and
they
fire
all
except
the
ten
white
males,
and
just
replace
them
with
ten
other
white
males.
nothing
could
be
done
about
it
as
i
understand
you.
justice
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
it
lie
here?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
so
if
it
was
cook
county
instead
of
where
the
case
arose,
you
have
a
whole
lot
of
probation
officers,
then
you
could
grant
equitable
relief?
justice
stevens
if
that's
true,
how
does
that
really
solve
the
problem
that
the
immunity
doctrine's
supposed
to
solve
in
part
of
avoiding
a
lot
of
law
suits
and
not
tying
up
the
judge's
time.
because
if
you
just
say
to
this
person
who's
been
improperly
or
allegedly
improperly
discharged,
you
can't
sue
for
damages,
i
would
assume
they'd
come
in
and
sue
and
ask
to
get
their
jobs
back.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
because
as
i
understood...
the
seventh
circuit
opinions
a
little
hard
for
me
to
know
just
where
they
draw
the
line
between
this
kind
of
immunity.
do
you
think
it
applies,
for
example,
to
secretaries,
law
clerks,
other
employees
in
an
office?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
judge
used
his
secretary
to
do
legal
research
for
him
and
analyze
the
record
and
check
citations.
some
secretaries
have
skills
that
others
don't
have.
wouldn't
that
make
her
decision
immune?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
think
you've
overlooked
a
point
justice
scalia
just
made.
i'm
the
defendant.
i
file
an
affidavit
and
i
say
my
secretary
did
all
this
stuff.
the
secretary
comes
out,
i
never
did
any
of
that.
you'd
have
to
have
a
trial
to
decide
what
she
really
did.
and
then
don't
you
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
absolute
immunity
is
to
free
the
judge
of
the
necessity
of
defending
the
law
suit.
justice
stevens
ms.
kaplan,
excuse
me
for
interrupting
again,
but
your
opponent
relies
heavily
on
ex
parte
virginia.
the
selection
of
jurors
for
racially
impermissible
grounds
by
a
judge.
why
is
the
selection
of
jurors
different
than
the
selection
of
probation
officers?
justice
stevens
the
work
of
a
juror
certainly
is
not
ministerial.
