justice
scalia
ms.
sedey,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
response
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
i
was
admiring
your
rigorous
adherence
to
the
logic
of
your
position,
but
ten
i
didn't
really
understand
that
logic
in
connection
with
the
chief
justice's
question.
did
you
say
that
there
would
be
judicial
immunity,
absolute
judicial
immunity
if
the
judge
fired
a
clerk
for
making
noise
during
the
argument
of
a
case?
justice
scalia
what's
the
magic
about
it,
that
it
is
a
contempt
order,
and
therefore
itself
a
judicial
act,
or
rather
that
it
is
a
contempt
order
issued
in
connection
with
another
judicial
proceeding?
justice
scalia
the
latter?
justice
scalia
so
having
held
her
in
contempt,
if
he
should
fire
this
contemptuous
clerk,
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
for
that
firing?
justice
scalia
there
would
be,
so
he
could
hold
her
in
contempt
but
couldn't
fire
her?
justice
scalia
some
administrative
acts
are
so
closely
connected
to
the
adjudicatory
function
that
immunity
would
attach?
for
example,
the
closest
example
to
that
was
the
example
that
justice
stevens
posed
about
the
assignment
of
an
opinion.
what
if
it
isn't
just
the
assignment
of
an
opinion
but
the
assignment
of
a
judge
to
a
particular
case
by
the
chief
judge
of
a
district,
and
the
litigant
comes
in
and
says,
this
judge
is
a
judge
that
is
known
to
be
a
hanging
judge
or
whatever,
to
be
a
judge
that
finds
the
facts
against
the
plaintiff,
and
the
only
reason
that
that
judge
was
assigned
to
this
case
was
because
i'm
a
woman.
justice
scalia
but
that's
an
administrative
decision,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
see,
so
you'd
allow
the
litigant
to
sue,
but
you
would
not
allow
the
judge
who
had
been
assigned
to
sue,
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
i'm
sorry.
you
would
not
allow
the
litigant,
but
you
would
allow
the
judge
to
sue?
justice
scalia
what
about
a
united
states
attorney
who
fires
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
on
the
claimed
ground
that
the
person's
incompetent,
but
the
individual
fired
claims
that
it
was
because
of
sex
discrimination?
justice
scalia
why?
i
don't
see
why.
i
mean,
you
have
the
same
function.
the
prosecutor
has
immunity
only
with
respect
to
his
prosecutory
decisions
that
are
related
to
the
judicial
function.
justice
scalia
so
assistant
u.s.
attorneys
can
be
fired
without
being
liable
for
suits.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by,
to
the
extent
that.
they
are.
i
mean,
they
all
are,
aren't
they?
that's
what
they
do.
they
prosecute
cases,
right?
so
therefore,
if
one
is
fired
for
incompetence,
allegedly
for
incompetence,
no
suit
would
lie
for
sex
discrimination?
justice
scalia
the
line
you're
asking
us
to
draw,
as
the
last
few
questions
indicate,
really
requires
very
specific
inquiry
into
the
character
of
the
particular
individual
involved,
as
opposed
to
the
line
which
your
opponent
would
draw,
which
is
one
that
can
be
drawn
sitting
back
in
an
armchair
and
just
thinking
about
the
function
involved.
and
there's
some
trouble
in
having
such
a
vague
line.
it
means
you
always
need
a
lawsuit
before
you
can
decide
whether
there's
a
lawsuit.
and
the
judge
is
to
some
extent
placed
at
risk
all
the
time.
justice
scalia
depends
on
how
you
use
your
secretary
as
your
response
to
justice
stevens
just
indicated.
justice
scalia
the
point
is
that
it
didn't
look
into
what
jurors
do.
it
looked
into
how
jurors
are
selected.
i
mean,
its
whole
point
of
departure
was
not
to
say,
what
do
jurors
do
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
selection
of
them
or
the
firing
of
them,
or
anything
else
constitutes
a
judicial
act.
what
it
looked
to
is
there
any
judicial
discretion
in
the
selecting
of
them.
if
we
applied
that
test
here,
there's
no
distinctively
judicial
discretion
involved.
justice
scalia
what
about
the
executive
process?
why
isn't
there
any
absolute
executive
immunity,
or
is
there?
do
we
have
some
somewhere?
justice
scalia
anybody
else?
justice
scalia
but
certainly
not
a
cabinet
secretary?
justice
scalia
wider
than
a
cabinet
secretary's?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
it
has
more
to
do,
as
judge
posner's
dissent
suggested,
that
if
there
is
a
distinction
between
let's
say
a
cabinet
secretary
and
a
judge,
that
what
it
comes
to
is
a
judge
is
more
likely
to
be
sued
by
a
litigant
than
a
cabinet
secretary,
personally,
you
know,
to
be
sued
personally
for
alleged
malfeasance
than
a
cabinet
secretary
is?
that
the
judicial
function
is
much
more
likely
to
be
gutted
by
litigation
than
is
the
executive
function?
justice
scalia
just
out
of
curiosity,
does
illinois
provide
indemnification
for
any
of
its
other
public
officials,
or
just
judges?
