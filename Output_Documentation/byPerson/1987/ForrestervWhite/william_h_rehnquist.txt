chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-761,
cynthia
forrester
versus
howard
lee
white.
ms.
sedey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let
me
interrupt
you
for
just
a
minute,
ms.
sedey,
if
i
may,
to
follow
up
on
some
of
the
earlier
questions.
supposing
that
a
judge
is
conducting
a
proceeding
in
court,
and
he
has
a
clerk
sitting
there,
a
clerk
of
the
court,
who
he
thinks
is
unduly
loquacious,
talking
with
people
coming
in.
and
so
he
tells
her
not
to
do
that,
and
she
says,
you
know,
when
a
man
sits
here
on
alternate
days
to
me,
you
let
him
talk
that
way.
i
think
you're
just
discriminating
against
me.
he
says,
you
do
it
again,
i'm
going
to
hold
you
in
contempt.
and
so
she
does
it
again,
he
holds
her
in
contempt.
now,
is
he
immune
from
that?
i
mean,
that's
closer,
much
closer
to
being
a
judicial
thing,
i
think,
than
the
examples
previously
given.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
your
argument
is
still
the
same.
you're
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
sex
between
two
similarly
situated
deputy
clerks
of
the
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
that's
pretty
clear.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
he
fired
her
and
truthfully
said
the
reason
i'm
firing
you
is
because
i
don't
retain
people
whom
i've
had
to
hold
in
contempt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
here,
we're
talking
about
money
damages?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
would
be
of
some
assistance
to
someone
in
the
seventh
circuit
from
the
time
the
seventh
circuit
decided
this
case
until
if
we
came
out
with
a
different
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed,
ms.
kaplan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
probation
officers
have
been
granted
absolute
immunity
as
against
a
suit
by
disappointed
prisoners?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
in
the
case
of
legislators,
there's
the
speech
and
debate
clause
which
expressly
provides
privilege
in
the
constitution,
whereas
the
immunity
for
judges
is
judicially
created?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
kaplan.
ms.
sedey,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sedey.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-761,
forrester
against
white
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
