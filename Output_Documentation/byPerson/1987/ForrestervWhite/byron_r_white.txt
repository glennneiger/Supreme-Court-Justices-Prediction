justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
what
if
the
suit
were
brought
against
the
clerk?
what
if
this
particular
law
clerk
or
officer,
probation
officer,
suppose
the
suit
is
against
the
probation
officer,
and
the
claim
is
that
the
probation
officer
has
been
misleading
the
judge
because
of
sexual
or
racial
discrimination?
so
what
if
it's
a
racial
discrimination
claim
against
the
probation
officer
in
connection
with
her
work?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
the
judge
doesn't
have
absolute
immunity
when
he
fires
her?
justice
white
does
he
have
any
immunity?
justice
white
well,
if
there's
qualified
immunity
in
this
case
which
you
concede
there
is
to
hold
the
judge
liable
for
damages,
it
would
have
to
be
found
that
he
had
to
know
that
he
was
firing
for
sex
discrimination,
because
of
gender.
justice
white
or
that
he...
well,
what
do
you
think
the
test
is
for
qualified
immunity?
justice
white
what
if
there
are
several
judges
in
a
certain
place
and
there's
a
chief
judge.
and
a
probation
officer
serves
one
or
two
of
the
judges
but
he
gets
fired
by
the
chief
judge
whom
the
probation
officer
has
never
ever
helped,
and
isn't
about
to.
the
chief
judge
doesn't
need
a
probation
officer
to
help
him.
is
that
judge
absolutely
immune?
justice
white
well,
that's
quite
a
different
rationale
than
you
just
stated
awhile
ago--
justice
white
--on
that
basis,
i
would
think
you
would
say
that
he
should
be
absolutely
immune
for
firing
his
secretary.
justice
white
do
you
think
you
could
have
gotten
an
injunction
for
reinstatement
here?
justice
white
just
for
lack
of
equity,
i
suppose.
justice
white
suppose
there
had
been
a
reinstatement
with
back
pay.
would
the
$86,000
equal
the
back
pay?
or
what
was
your
measure
of
damages?
justice
white
and
the
jury
awarded
the
damages,
i
take
it?
justice
white
and
is
there
any
provision
for
the
judge
to
be
reimbursed
by
the
state
or
by
the
county
or?
justice
white
well,
so
you
think
the
situation
is
just
as
though
the
state
said,
well
we
know
there's
a
policy
about
immunity
that
the
supreme
court
will
protect
our
state
officers,
but
we
don't
want
protection
for
our
state
officers,
for
our
judges.
if
they
commit
constitutional
violations,
it
should
be
stopped,
and
we
will
let
judgment
be
entered
against
them,
but
we
will
pay
them,
we
will
pay
the
damages?
justice
white
yes,
yes.
they
could
say,
let
them
pay.
or
they
could
say,
let
judgment
be
entered,
but
we'll
pay.
justice
white
which
is
what
you
think
should
be
the
case
here?
