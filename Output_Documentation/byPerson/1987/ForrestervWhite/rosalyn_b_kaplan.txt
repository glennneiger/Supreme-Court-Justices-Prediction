ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
seventh
circuit
properly
upheld
a
grant
of
judicial
immunity
in
connection
with
the
actions
of
judge
white
in
this
case.
and
i
would
ask
this
court
today
to
recognize
that
where
an
employee's
tasks
are
an
integral
part
of
the
discretionary
judicial
decision
making
process
acts
in
regard
to
personnel
decisions
regarding
this
employee
ought
also
to
be
recognized
as
judicial
acts,
and
the
judge
ought
to
be
entitled
to
immunity
for
executing
such
acts.
the
duties
of
a
probation
officer
have
been
well
recognized
as
substantive
functions
that
assist
the
discretionary
decision
making
process.
the
substance
of
a
judge's
sentencing
decisions,
his
disposition
in
juvenile
cases
are
going
to
reflect
the
quality,
the
advice,
the
recommendations
of
his
probation
officer.
the
soundness
of
those
decisions
is
an
important
consideration
and
a
judge
who
is
concerned
about
the
quality
of
his
decisions
has
got
to
make
a
personnel
decision
reflecting
his
concerns
for
his
decision
making
tasks.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
the
immunity
that
would
be
addressed
there
would
likely
be
an
executive
type
of
immunity
and
the
considerations
are
going
to
have
to
be
different
accordingly.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
to
the
extent
that
your
honor
is
talking
about
the
quasi
judicial
immunity
that's
extended
to
a
prosecutor
in
connection
with
prosecutorial
decisions
and
he
has
to
address
a
situation
where
his
employee
is
assisting
him
in
making
discretionary
decisions,
i
would
agree
that
the
same
analysis
would
apply.
i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
that
when
an
employee
is
involved
in
a
task
that
is
an
integral
part
of
a
judicial
process
for
which
immunity
applies,
the
personnel
decisions
regarding
that
employee
should
equally
be
recognized
as
judicial
acts
and
entitled
to
the
same
sort
of
immunity.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
to
the
extent
that
assistant
u.s.
attorneys
are
engaged
in
the
same
discretionary
function.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
yes.
the
same
reasoning
would
apply,
your
honor.
this
court
has
recognized
that
for
a
member
of
congress,
for
example,
that
member
of
congress
cannot
execute
all
of
his
legislative
functions
by
himself.
he
must
have
legislative
aides,
and
the
duties
of
those
legislative
aides
to
the
extent
that
they
are
legislative
duties
which
are
those
of
the
member
of
congress--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--certainly,
it
could
be
challenged,
your
honor.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
he
would
be
subject
to
an
action
for
damages.
this
court
has
noted
that
prosecutors
are
subject
to
very
strict
internal
controls.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
could
be
that
way.
could
be
done
through--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--your
honor,
he
could
be
disciplined
internally
as
a
prosecutor.
he
could
be
subject
to
criminal
sanctions
for
an
intentional
violation
of
the
federal
law,
as
of
course
could
a
judge.
the
immunity
that
we're
arguing
here
is
only
an
immunity
from
liability
for
a
civil
action
and
damages.
and
it
further
is
a
policy
that
is
a
policy
that
has
often
been
recognized--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--an
equitable
action
has
been
allowed
by
this
court
under
pulliam
v.
allen.
as
to
whether
or
not
this
individual
would
be
entitled
to
the
relief
of
reinstatement,
i
believe
that--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--i
believe
that
would
however
pose
another
difficulty.
the
courts
even
in
addressing
equitable
relief,
for
example,
under
title
vii,
have
recognized
that
they
will
find
other
relief
than
to
require
that
an
individual
work
very
closely
with
an
individual
who
has
been
fired.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
don't
know
that
each
assistant
prosecutor
would
work
so
closely
with
the
united
states
attorney.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
what
i
mean.
in
the
situation
of
a
staff
of
attorneys
working
for
one
prosecutor,
i
believe
that
equitable
relief
would
lie.
that
situation
has
got
to
be
distinguished
from
this
situation.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i'd
like
to
distinguish
that
on
the
basis
of
the
close
and
personal
relationship
in
a
very
small
office
in
a
county
court
where
there
is
a
judge
working
closely
with
one
probation
officer
and
all
of
those
functions
are
performed
together.
i
think
it's
a
difference
in
degree
and
equitable
relief
would
have
to
take
that
into
consideration.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
think
that
perhaps
equitable
relief
would
lie.
there's
a
different
procedure
involved.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
think
that's
a
possibility.
i
think
that's
a
possibility
that
this
court
allowed
to
exist
through
its
decision
in
pulliam
v.
allen,
and
that
there
are
still
other
interests
inherent
in
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
and
one
of
those
is
the
potential
liability
of
a
judge
for
an
action
in
damages.
the
state
of
the
law
on
judicial
immunity
as
it
exists
now
is
that
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
will
lie.
that
has
to
be
acknowledged.
nonetheless,
i
think
there
are
still
important
considerations
under
the
function
of
judicial
immunity
and
that
a
judge
ought
to
be
able
to
take
those
into
account
and
not
be
risking
his
personal
action
for
damages
and
to
cut
back
on
some
of
the
time
that
he
must
spend
involved
in
litigation
in
order
to
fulfill
his
decision
making
process.
certainly,
his
fears
of
retaliation
are
realistic
fears.
in
pulliam
v.
allen,
the
dissent
of
this
court
noted
that
actions
for
discrimination
had
geometrically
increased
since
the
enactment
of
section
1988.
last
year
alone,
civil
rights
employment
litigation
increased
in
the
federal
district
courts
by
14
percent,
and
this
was
at
a
time
when
other
civil
actions,
the
filing
of
other
civil
cases
had
decreased
for
the
first
time
since
i
believe
1977.
the
fear
is
there.
it's
a
realistic
fear
perhaps
a
judge
that
knows
more
about
the
process
than
anyone
is
going
to
be
more
concerned
than
anyone
of
risking
this
kind
of
litigation.
so
the
question
becomes,
when
a
judge
is
faced
with
a
decision
of
retaining
a
probation
officer
in
whom
he
lacks
confidence,
should
he
have
to
weigh
in
the
balance
the
threat
of
litigation
by
that
particular
individual?
there's
always
a
balance
involved
in
any
case
of
judicial
immunity.
and
the
balance
has
to
be
addressed.
and
i
believe
the
balance
in
a
particular
situation
where
an
employee
is
part
of
the
substantive
decision
making
process
that
a
favorable
decision
for
judicial
immunity
will
further
the
judicial
process.
certainly
the
judge
may
be
disciplined.
certainly
the
judge
may
be
subject
to
an
action
for
criminal
violations
of
the
federal
law.
but
i
ask
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
balance
is
in
favor
of
a
finding
of
immunity
for
this
kind
of
personnel
action
by
a
judge.
not
only
is
immunity
proper
as
a
matter
of
policy,
but
i
believe
it
is
consistent
with
the
precedent
of
this
court.
certainly
as
a
general
proposition,
it's
recognized
that
judicial
immunity
shields
a
judge
from
liability
for
damages
for
his
judicial
acts
taken
within
the
general
scope
of
his
jurisdiction.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
think
that
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
would
apply
very
likely
to
an
individual
like
a
law
clerk,
and
perhaps
to
a
staff
attorney
in
certain
courts.
it
would
not
i
believe
apply
to
a
secretary,
and
that
five
days
after
the
court
entered
this
opinion
in
forrester
v.
white,
it
entered
an
opinion
in
mcmillan
v.
svetanoff,
and
in
that
case,
a
judge
had
fired
his
court
reporter,
and
the
court
did
not
disavow
its
reasoning
in
forrester
v.
white,
but
it
explained
that
in
the
case
of
a
court
reporter,
the
individual
employee
did
not
assist
the
judge
in
his
decision
making
functions,
and
because
of
that
distinction,
the
relationship
was
more
that
of
an
employee
and
an
employer,
rather
than
a
judge
and
an
assistant
to
a
judge.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
mcmillan
rationale
was
later
applied
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
guercio
v.
brody,
and
in
that
case,
a
federal
bankruptcy
judge
was
held
not
immune
from
an
action
for
damages
for
firing
his
personal
secretary.
so
i
believe
that
that
is
where
the
line
is
drawn
under
the
seventh
circuit's
reasoning.
and
it's
a
line
just
based
upon
the
contributions
that
the
employee
makes
to
the
judicial
process.
it's
by
looking
at
the
relationship
to
the
judicial
process
that
i
believe
this
court
has
identified
what
is
a
judicial
act.
in
stump
v.
sparkman,
the
court
established
its
two
criteria;
whether
the
challenged
act
is
a
function
that
is
normally
performed
by
a
judge,
and
whether
the
parties
dealt
with
a
judge
in
his
judicial
capacity.
now,
the
case
law
establishes
that
these
criteria
were
not
intended
to
narrow
the
scope
of
what
is
a
judicial
act.
in
stump,
the
matter
before
the
court
was
an
ex
parte
petition.
the
person
affected
by
the
petition
was
not
before
the
court
in
person
or
by
counsel.
there
was
no
right
of
appeal
for
the
affected
person.
but
nonetheless,
it
was
regarded
as
a
judicial
act
and
entitled
to
immunity.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
judge
is
absolutely
immune
because
he
is
assisting
the
decision
making
process,
i
would
assume,
in
firing
a
probation
officer
if
that
is
his
responsibility.
ordinarily,
this
kind
of
decision--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--your
honor,
i'm
proposing
a
rationale--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--the
secretary
does
not
contribute
to
the
decision
making
process
and
the
probation
officer
does.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
think
that,
your
honor,
is
not
a
discretionary
function.
i
hope
not.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
referring
to
someone
who
has
substantive
input
in
the
discretionary
functions.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
think
that
that
could
change
the
decision,
your
honor,
because
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
you're
describing
a
situation
of
someone
whose
more
like
a
paralegal
assistant,
than
simply
a
secretary
who
is
engaged
in
what
you
might
call
more
ministerial
type
functions,
as
the
court
has
recognized
a
distinction
there.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
think
that
as
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
applied,
that
the
line
is
going
to
become
rather
clear.
a
judge
will
have
a
limited
number
of
employees.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
yes,
again.
but
to
just
call
someone
a
secretary
if
in
fact
what
they're
doing
is
the
work
of
a
paralegal,
i
think
that
they
are
not
going
to
be
a
great
number.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
think
that
in
most
cases,
your
honor,
a
very
limited
inquiry
based
on
the
kind
of
job
description
of
the
individual
should
be
sufficient.
it's
obviously
not
going
to
be
workable
if
there's
going
to
become
an
inquiry
where
every
individual's
going
to
say
well
i
did
this
and
i
did
this
and
the
reason
that
this
particular
individual
didn't
do
anything
further
was
that
the
judge
didn't
trust
that
individual
in
the
first
place.
i
believe
that
is
getting
more
complex
than
would
serve
the
purposes
of
immunity.
but
i
don't
think
that
means
a
line
absolutely
cannot
be
drawn.
and
to
the
extent
that
a
line
has
to
be
explored,
i
think
that
it
should
be
explored
on
the
basis
of
what
type
of
individual
is
serving
the
judge
in
a
judicial
capacity.
i
don't
think
that
is
going
to
create
a
huge
number
of
lawsuits
in
order
to
isolate
the
kinds
of
tasks
that
are
involved.
and
i
think
that
certainly
it's
worth
the
trouble
for
the
courts
to
engage
in
that
function.
a
judicial
process
is
being
served,
and
that's
how
a
judicial
act
is
identified.
as
in
stump,
that
was
a
judicial
act.
this
court
noted
that
the
issuance
of
a
warrant,
even
when
there's
no
case
pending,
and
there
may
never
be
a
case
pending,
that
also
is
a
judicial
act.
jurors
have
derivative
judicial
immunity
because
of
the
way
they
engage
in
the
judicial
process,
their
participation
in
the
judicial
process,
witnesses
have
judicial
immunity
because
of
their
participation
in
the
judicial
process.
and
indeed,
as
this
court
observed,
probation
officers
have
often
been
granted
absolute
immunity
because
of
their
substantive
contributions
to
the
process.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
i
mean.
and
this
type
of
function
is
what
i
believe
the
court
needs
to
look
at.
this
court
has
not
addressed
many
circumstances
where
personnel
decisions
are
at
issue.
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald,
i
recognize
that
was
a
very
particular
situation.
in
davis
v.
passman,
a
minority
of
this
court
did
recognize
that
an
employee
who
assisted
a
legislator
that
those
duties
were
bound
up
with
the
function
of
the
legislator.
and
that
kind
of
analysis
has
been
examined
in
depth
by
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
the
reasoning
that
i'm
urging
this
court
today
is
reasoning
that
can
be
found
in
the
decisions
of
those
courts,
and
i
think
it's
very
persuasive
reasoning.
in
agromayer
v.
colberg,
the
first
circuit
considered
a
situation
where
an
individual
had
applied
for
a
position
as
a
press
officer
with
the
puerto
rican
house
of
representatives.
the
district
court,
in
that
case,
in
evaluating
the
claim
of
the
individual
who
was
refused
the
position,
did
apply
the
kind
of
bright
line
test
that
is
being
urged
by
the
petitioner
today.
and
it
said,
well,
hiring
or
firing,
that's
administrative,
there's
no
immunity.
but
the
court
of
appeals
examined
the
situation
and
felt
that
that
kind
of
evaluation
was
too
narrow,
because
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
employee
was
considered
essential
to
the
legislative
process,
then
his
qualifications
and
his
selection
ought
also
to
be
considered
essential
to
the
legislative
process.
in
browning
v.
clerk,
u.s.
house
of
representatives,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
echoed
similar
reasoning.
there,
a
lawsuit
was
brought
by
an
official
reporter
who
had
been
fired
by
the
house
of
representatives.
and
the
court
recognized
that
the
ultimate
issue
before
it
was
not
the
personnel
act
involved,
but
rather
the
issue
was
the
duties
of
that
employee.
and
if
the
duties
implicated
speech
or
debate
concerns,
then
personnel
action
ought
to
be
found
to
implicate
the
same
concerns.
i
think
that
that
analysis
is
equally
useful
in
evaluating
a
claim
of
judicial
immunity
for
a
personnel
decision.
if
a
probation
officer's
duties
are...
and
i
submit
that
they
are...
an
integral
part
of
the
judicial
process,
then
a
personnel
decision
regarding
that
employee
ought
also--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--in
ex
parte
virginia,
the
court
ruled
on
two
alternative
bases,
and
this
court
has
since
recognized
that
it
did
not
hold
necessarily
that
a
ministerial
act
was
involved,
but
that
if
the
act
were
ministerial
or
judicial,
nonetheless,
the
judge
in
question
could
be
held
liable
under
the
criminal
civil
rights
laws.
the
court
in
evaluating
and
in
hypothesizing
that
the
act
was
ministerial
stated
that
because
the
act
of
selecting
jurors
could
be
performed
by
anyone,
it
admitted
of
no
judicial
discretion.
whether
that
would
be
held
the
same
way,
whether
the
same
discussion
would
apply
today
as
far
as
the
selection
of
jurors,
i
do
not
know.
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
selection
and
the
contributions
of
the
probation
officer
are
indeed
ministerial.
i
believe
that
the
work
that
the
probation
officer
does
is
substantive.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
however,
at
the
time,
the
qualifications
of
a
juror
and
the
performance
of
a
juror,
i
don't
believe
were
inquired
into
in
the
same
manner
that
they
are
today,
and
i
don't
know
that
the
court
would
indeed
find
that
the
selections
of
jurors
was
a
nondiscretionary
task
today.
and
of
course
the
court
in
ex
parte
virginia
did
not
specifically
so
hold.
the
point
is
that
if--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
is
discretion
involved,
that
is,
to
the
extent
that
a
judge
must
utilize
his
own
judicial
skills
in
evaluating
the
work
of
the
employee
that
he
has
selected
to
help
engage
in
those
skills.
again,
the
ex
parte
virginia
case
was
not
a
case
involving
a
civil
action.
it
was
not
decided
on
the
basis
of
whether
this
was
a
judicial
act
or
not.
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
judge's
liability
to
criminal
law.
i
believe
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
a
judge
ought
to
be
allowed
to
have
the
freedom
to
exercise
his
particular
training
and
his
particular
skills
in
order
to
evaluate
the
kind
of
assistant
that
he
is
going
to
have
to
assist
him
in
executing
those
skills.
certainly,
that
is
the
same
position
that
i've
been
advocating
that
has
been
followed
in
cases
of
legislative
immunity.
and
it
only
applies
when
the
individual
in
question
is
engaged
in
the
particular
functions
that
are
the
functions
of
the
official
whom
the
immunity
protects.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
first
of
all,
the
analysis
that
has
been
applied
for
legislative
immunity
has
been
applied
equally
to
state
legislators
who
are
not
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
and
to
federal
legislators.
but
i
particularly
would
point
out
that
this
court's
observation
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
that
the
source
of
the
immunity
is
not
so
controlling
as
the
nature
and
the
reasons
of
the
immunity.
and
i
think
that
there's
a
very
good
analogy
to
be
drawn
in
looking
at
the
language
used
to
describe
the
function
and
the
extent
of
legislative
immunity
that
parallels
quite
closely
the
language
used
to
describe
the
purpose
and
the
extent
of
judicial
immunity.
i
think
the
parallels
there
are
very
apt.
legislative
immunity
exists
to
protect
the
due
functioning
of
the
legislative
process,
and
it
only
extends
so
far
as
is
necessary
to
protect
those
functions.
judicial
immunity
has
the
same
sort
of
reasoning.
it
exists
only
insofar
as
necessary
to
protect
the
judicial
process,
and
those
particular
functions
that
are
identified
as
a
part
of
the
judicial
process.
i'm
asking
the
court
to
recognize
that
in
personnel
questions,
there
is
more
than
just
a--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--this
court
did
hold
that
there
was
absolute
immunity
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
for
the
president.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
and
it
did
not
decide
whether
his
assistants
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
might
be
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
for
the
same
sort
of
decision.
the
case
was
remanded
for
that
purpose.
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
distinction
has
been
made
on
the
basis
of
the
kinds
of
discretion
that
are
executed.
and
for
a
judge,
the
discretion
is
very
wide.
his
sentencing
decisions
certainly--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--this
court
i
believe
has
so
held,
your
honor,
yes,
that
the
judicial--
ms.
rosalyn
b.
kaplan
--i
agree
that
that
is
one
reason
for
immunity,
yes,
your
honor.
another
reason
is
the
exercise
of
the
kind
of
discretion
and
the
policy
decisions
that
have
been
traditionally
made
in
favor
of
protecting
the
judicial
process
from
this
kind
of
interference.
it's
that
kind
of
policy
decision
that
i
believe
applies
in
this
case
as
well
as
to
a
litigant,
and
i
would
recall
that
this
court's
earliest
decisions
based
upon
judicial
immunity
were
not
issued
because
a
judge
had
been
sued
by
a
disappointed
litigant.
rather,
they
were
issued
where
a
judge
had
disbarred
an
attorney,
stricken
an
attorney
from
the
rolls
of
court.
it's
a
different
kind
of
situation,
and
i
suggest
that
the
rationale
there,
although
the
court
did
discuss
the
cases
of
disappointed
litigants,
the
true
rationale
is
the
protection
of
the
judicial
process
by
enabling
a
court
to
have
this
authority
over
the
appointment
and
the
removal
of
these
officers
of
the
court.
a
probation
officer
is
also
an
officer
of
the
court.
and
i
think
that
the
decisions
made
with
regard
to
the
probation
officer
ought
also
to
be
recognized
as
judicial
decisions.
your
honors,
in
these
days
where
judicial
case
loads
are
increasing
and
a
judge
must
increasingly
rely
on
the
substantive
aid
of
his
assistants,
such
as
a
probation
officer,
i
believe
that
a
judge
is
entitled
to
absolute
judicial
immunity
for
his
acts,
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
