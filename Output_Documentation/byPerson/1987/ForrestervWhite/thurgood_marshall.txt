what
would
happen
if
the
judge
fired
his
clerk?
would
that
be
judicial?
justice
marshall
well,
suppose
he
fired
his
law
clerk.
would
that
be
judicial?
justice
marshall
well,
suppose
the
judge
fired
his
assistant,
his
chauffeur?
what
would
that
be?
justice
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
asking
you.
justice
marshall
suppose
he
appoints
a
master
to
hear
the
case
and
fires
him.
would
that
be
judicial?
justice
marshall
well,
if
the
master
happened
to
be
a
woman,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
marshall
you
need
more
than
that,
don't
you?
justice
marshall
and
where
is
that
here?
justice
marshall
that
doesn't
mean...
you
can
assert
anything
in
a
pleading.
that
doesn't
do
it.
i've
read
the
statute
and
everything
in
this
statute
is
judicial.
everything
that
this
woman
was
doing
was
judicial.
everything
that
i
read
in
here.
on
pages
84,
for
example.
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
assisting
the
judge
judicial?
justice
marshall
what
would
the
judge
have
to
do?
file
charges
against
this
person?
justice
marshall
that's
this
case,
i'm
talking
about
this
case
here?
justice
marshall
what
could
he
have
done
in
this
situation
that
would
have
satisfied
you?
justice
marshall
no,
you
know
that's
not
my
question.
with
the
exact
same
facts
as
this
case,
what
could
he
do?
justice
marshall
and
that's
all
he
can
do?
justice
marshall
he
has
no
protection
at
all?
justice
marshall
suppose
the
probation
officer's
a
man
and
punches
the
judge
in
the
mouth,
what
could
the
judge
do
then?
justice
marshall
he
could?
justice
marshall
oh,
he
can
get
some
relief
sometimes.
and
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case?
justice
marshall
she
didn't
punch
him
in
the
mouth.
justice
marshall
that's
the
difference.
justice
marshall
so
then
you
come
back
that
if
this
were
a
man,
he
wouldn't
have
any
cause
of
action?
justice
marshall
but
he
has
a
cause
of
action
if
he's
a
woman.
is
that
your
position?
justice
marshall
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
the
secretary
doesn't
participate
in
the...
who
types
the
opinion?
justice
marshall
i
hate
to
get
on
this
point,
but
1983
didn't
apply
to
women.
