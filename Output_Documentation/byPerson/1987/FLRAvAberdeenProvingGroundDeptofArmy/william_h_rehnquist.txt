chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
86-1715,
federal
labor
relations
authority
versus
aberdeen
proving
ground,
department
of
the
army.
ms.
peters,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
peters--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--as
i
understand
the
government's
contention
is
that
section
7117(a)(2),
which
is
reproduced
on
3a
of
your
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
when
it
says
that
the
duty
to
bargain
extends
only
if
the
authority
is
determined
under
subsection
(b)
of
this
section
that
no
compelling
need
exists,
that
that
is
the
only
way
that
a
compelling
need
determination
may
be
made
that
will
influence
the
bargaining...
now,
what
is
your
response
in
terms
of
just
specific
statutory
provisions
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
if
it
says
"only
if"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
doesn't
say
only
if
there
is
a
compelling,
it
says
only
if
the
authority
is
determined
under
subsection
(b)
of
this
section
that
no
compelling
need
exists.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
word
"only"
is
not
ordinarily
an
ambiguous
word.
if
it
says
this
shall
be
done
only
in
this
way,
it
means
only
that
and
not
otherwise.
and
you
have
to
really
swallow
that
here,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
peters.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
ms.
peters,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
peters.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
86-1715,
federal
labor
relations
authority
versus
aberdeen
proving
ground.
in
this
case
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
unanimously
affirmed.
