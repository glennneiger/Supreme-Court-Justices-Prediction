ms.
ruth
e.
peters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
arises
under
title
7
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
of
1978,
the
statutory
scheme
for
labor-management
relations
in
the
federal
sector.
the
case
involves
a
principle
that
is
as
basic
to
labor
relations
in
the
federal
sector
as
it
is
in
the
private
sector,
namely,
an
employer's
obligation
to
bargain
over
negotiable
matters
before
making
changes
in
the
working
conditions
of
employees.
the
case
also
involves
the
relationship
between
section
7117
of
title
vii,
which
describes
the
substantive
scope
of
bargaining
in
the
federal
sector
and
establishes
administrative
procedures
for
resolving
scope
of
bargaining
or
negotiability
issues,
and
the
statutory
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
which
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
federal
employer
to
refuse
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
also
establish
procedures
for
adjudicating
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
in
this
case,
when
respondent
aberdeen
proving
ground
announced
that
it
would
curtail
operations
the
day
after
thanksgiving
and
that
employees
would
be
placed
on
forced
annual
leave
for
that
day,
the
exclusive
representative
of
aberdeen's
employees
proposed
that
the
employees
instead
be
granted
administrative
leave
for
that
day.
aberdeen
refused
to
bargain
on
the
union's
proposals,
stating
that
agency
regulations
precluded
a
grant
of
administrative
leave
in
those
circumstances.
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
case
that
ensued,
the
authority
reexamined
and
reaffirmed
its
previous
holdings
that
the
authority
is
empowered
to
resolve
in
a
unilateral
change
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
an
employer
agency's
defense
that
bargaining
is
barred
by
an
agency
regulation
for
which
a
compelling
need
exists.
the
authority's
consistent
holdings
on
this
point
are,
we
submit,
faithful
to
the
text
and
the
purposes
of
the
authority's
enabling
act,
consistent
with
the
authority's
undisputed
ability
to
resolve
other
negotiability
differences
in
unilateral
change
unfair
labor
practice
cases,
consistent
with
the
practice
under
the
executive
order
program
that
predated
title
vii,
and
constitute
an
appropriate
harmonizing
of
the
negotiability
and
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
title
vii.
however,
respondent
aberdeen
argues
that
compelling
need
issues
alone
among
all
the
negotiability
defenses
available
to
an
employer
may
only
be
resolved
in
the
appeal
procedures
established
in
section
7117,
and
indeed
that
the
employer's
obligation
to
bargain
is
not
even
triggered
until
the
authority
resolves
the
compelling
need
issue
in
the
negotiability
appeal
forum.
aberdeen's
proffered
view
of
section
7117
cannot
be
squared
with
the
structure,
the
purposes,
and
the
history
of
that
provision
and
would
not
give
effect
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
statute.
it
is
incorrect
to
view
congress's
intending
that
an
employer's
mere
assertion
of
a
compelling
need
for
an
agency
regulation
should
be
permitted
to
disrupt
the
bargaining
obligation
in
unilateral
change
cases
when
congress
also
intended
that
agency
regulations
be
one
of
the
statute's
least
restrictive
bars
to
bargaining.
the
authority's
consistent
construction
of
its
enabling
act,
we
submit,
should
be
upheld.
to
examine
the
issues
in
this
case
it
is
helpful
to
review
very
briefly
the
scope
of
bargaining
in
the
federal
sector.
a
federal
sector
employer's
statutory
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
exclusive
representative
is
as
a
general
matter
a
broad
obligation.
however,
the
statutory
terms
governing
federal
sector
bargaining,
besides
defining
the
scope
of
matters
included
in
the
bargaining
obligation,
also
enumerate
several
matters
that
are
excluded
from
the
scope
of
the
duty
to
bargain.
for
example,
section
7117(a)(1)
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
duty
to
bargain
does
not
encompass
proposals
that
would
bring
about
an
inconsistency
with
federal
law
or
government-wide
regulation.
also
excluded
from
the
duty
to
bargain
are
proposals
that
would
improperly
intrude
on
the
exercise
of
the
management
rights
listed
in
section
7106,
and
the
statute
in
section
7117(c)
establishes
a
negotiability
appeal
procedure
for
resolving
those
kinds
of
scope
of
bargaining
questions.
the
statute
in
section
7117(a)(2)
also
excludes
from
the
bargaining
obligation
proposals
which
would
bring
about
an
inconsistency
only
with
those
regulations
for
which
there
is
a
compelling
need,
and
section
7117(b)
establishes
an
appeal
procedure
for
resolving
this
type
of
negotiability
issue.
the
authority's
regulations
implementing
section
7117
provide
that
when
an
employer
agency
refuses
to
bargain
over
a
union's
proposal
during
ongoing
negotiations
because
the
proposal
is
alleged
to
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
duty
to
bargain,
and
when
no
unilateral
change
or
contemplated
changes
in
conditions
of
employment
are
involved,
then
the
negotiability
issues
are
to
be
resolved
through
the
negotiability
appeal
procedure
set
forth
in
section
7117.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
there
has
been
no
compliance
that
we
know
of,
and
certainly
even
if
the
bargaining
had
taken
place
there
is
at
least
a
notice
posting
remedy
as
well
and
the
employer
here
continues
to
resist
the
notion
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
would
be
appropriate--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--if
we
prevail,
the
merits
of
the
compelling
need,
the
authority's
compelling
need
determination
that
there
is
no
compelling
need
for
the
agency
regulation
have
not
yet
been
resolved.
i
think
the
matter
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals,
unless,
of
course,
the
employer
decided
at
that
point
to
comply
with
the
authority's
order
in
all
respects.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
no,
there
is
not.
one
of
the
bills
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
was
the
house
bill
reported
out
of
the
house
committee.
that
bill,
although
it
referred
to
a
compelling
need
determination,
would
have
for
the
first
time
in
a
rather
fundamental
fashion
broadened
the
scope
of
bargaining
beyond
what
had
existed
under
the
executive
order
by
permitting
bargaining
in
an
area
in
which
an
employer
did
not
ordinarily
have
administrative
discretion,
that
is,
matters
covered
by
government-wide
regulation,
unless
there
were
a
compelling
need
for
the
government-wide
regulation.
and
also
the
house
report
accompanying
that
bill
indicated
that
other
types
of
scope
of
bargaining
issues
other
than
these
government-wide
regulation
issues
would
always
be
decided
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
however,
that
provision
was
rejected,
did
not
make
its
way
into
law.
instead,
what
we
have
here
is
a
system
that
is
fairly
much
analogous
to
the
executive
order
program.
that
is,
the
basic
contours
of
the
scope
of
bargaining
are
pretty
much
the
same.
an
employer
is
not
obliged
to
bargain
over
matters
that
are
inconsistent
with
federal
law
or
government-wide
regulation
or
with
agency
regulations,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
a
compelling
need
exists
for
the
agency
regulation.
and
also
there
is
a
statutory
management
right--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--the--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--yes,
the
section
7117(b)
provides
that
the
authority
may
at
its
discretion
in
that
appeal
procedure
hold
a
hearing.
to
my
knowledge,
the
authority
has
never
held
a
hearing
on
a
compelling
need
issue
under
those
negotiability
appeals
procedures.
of
course,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
any
higher
level
agency
first
of
all
from
internally
notifying
a
subordinate
level
that
when
such
an
issue
comes
up,
to
let
them
know
so
that
they
can
submit
a
written
paper
or
assist
them
in
the
pleadings
before
the
authority,
but
the
solicitor
general--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
sometimes
the
higher
agency
level
is
indeed
a
party
respondent
and
sometimes
not.
it
is
not
in
this
case,
but
for
example
i
think
in
both...
let's
see,
in
the
first
case
to
be
decided,
i
think
defense
logistics
agency,
at
least
the
primary
national
subdivision,
i
think,
was
a
party
respondent
to
that
case,
and
in
some
of
these
other
cases
that
the
authorities
decided
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
as
well.
the
higher
agency
level
is
named
as
a
party
respondent,
not
in
all
cases.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
it
is
not
accidental.
it
is
alleged
that
they
themselves
have--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--engaged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
that--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--i
think
we
can
be
assured
that
they
will
have
the
opportunity
if
they
wish.
they
may
not
always
be
a
party,
but
the
authority's
regulations
would
permit
someone
to
take
part
in
an
unfair
labor
practice.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
i
would
be
rather
surprised
if
the
authority
wouldn't
in
these
circumstances.
further,
even
if
it
did--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
i--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--it
wouldn't
have
to
if
it
didn't
want
to,
but
then
on
a
petition
for
review
someone
would
suggest
perhaps
that
it
had
improperly
denied
someone
access
and
in
any
event
its
views
on
intervention
or
taking
parts
in
proceedings
it
seems
to
me
are
fairly
liberal,
but
furthermore,
an
attorney
or
labor
relations
specialist
from
a
higher
agency
level
could
assist
the
people
involved
in
the
authority
litigation
at
the
level
of
bargaining
in
any
fashion
that
it
wished,
so
really
there
is...
it
can't
be
said
that
if
the
higher
agency
level
wishes
in
some
fashion
to
make
its
views
known,
that
it
would
be
really
precluded
from
having
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
no,
i
don't
think
congress
was
being
silly
in
any
of
these
provisions.
and
in
fact,
i
think
what
the
authority
has
tried
to
do
is
to
give
effect
to
both
the
negotiability
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions.
precisely
why
congress
first
made
hearings
discretionary
but
then
also
required
that
agencies
be
involved
if
there
were
a
hearing
is
really
not
clear.
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief
and
petition,
perhaps
it
would
be
to
provide
the
agency
one
more
chance
to
waive
the
issue
of
compelling
need
before
the
resources
were
expended
upon
going
forward
with
a
hearing
on
the
matter,
but
we
would
note
that
in
the
absence
of
a
hearing,
and
to
my
knowledge
there
hasn't
been
a
hearing
on
compelling
need
issues,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
agency
be...
participate
in
the
negotiability
appeal
procedure.
the
authority's
determination
that
it
is
empowered
to
resolve
an
employer's
compelling
need
negotiability
defense
in
a
unilateral
change
case
draws
support
first
of
all
from
section
7117.
it
is
apparent
from
the
text
and
structure
of
section
7117
that
these
provisions
have
as
their
object
purpose
to
describe
the
substantive
scope
of
the
bargaining
obligation
and
to
provide
procedures
for
resolving
negotiability
issues,
and
this
purpose
is
as
apparent
in
the
compelling
need
provisions
as
in
the
other
parts
of
section
7117.
the
authority
gives
effect
to
these
provisions
by
construing
section
7117
as
providing
the
appropriate
forum
for
resolving
negotiability
issues
that
emanate
from
ongoing
collective
bargaining
negotiations
when
no
unilateral
change
issues
are
involved,
but
given
the
purpose
of
the
provisions,
to
describe
and
determine
the
extent
of
the
bargaining
obligation,
it
seems
difficult
indeed
to
view
any
word
or
part
of
these
provisions
as
establishing
a
condition
precedent
for
the
duty
to
bargain
or
as
defining
when
the
duty
to
bargain
arises,
and
any
attempt
to
read
the
terms
of
section
7117
as
precluding
the
resolution
of
compelling
need
issues
in
unilateral
change
cases
must
begin
with
the
acknowledgement
that
not
a
single
word
in
section
7117
explicitly
addresses
the
relationship
between
that
section
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
statute.
as
the
d.c.
circuit
recently
noted
in
nlpbu
versus
flra,
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
the
relationship
between
the
statute's
negotiability
provisions
and
its
unfair
labor
practice
procedures
is
profoundly
ambiguous.
in
this
context
the
authority's
construction
of
the
statutory
terms
to
give
effect
to
both
the
negotiability
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
surely
must
pass
a
test
of
reasonableness.
the
authority's
construction
of
the
statute
draws
further
support
from
the
historical
development
of
the
compelling
need
test,
which
was
introduced
during
the
executive
order
era
in
order
to
broaden
the
scope
of
bargaining
and
to
limit
the
availability
of
agency
regulations
as
a
bar
to
bargaining,
and
indeed,
given
the
stringent
criteria
developed
by
the
authority,
like
its
executive
order
predecessor
for
evaluating
compelling
need,
and
given
that
the
employer
bears
the
burden
of
demonstrating
the
existence
of
a
compelling
need,
agency
regulations
serve
as
one
of
the
least
restrictive
bars
to
bargaining.
in
this
context,
it
would
seem
incongruous
to
view
congress
as
intending
that
compelling
need
determinations
serve
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
triggering
of
the
bargaining
obligation
or
to
view
compelling
need
determinations
as
the
sole
negotiability
defense
that
may
not
be
resolved
in
a
unilateral
change
unfair
labor
practice
case.
in
addition,
the
authority's
practice
of
resolving
negotiability
defenses,
including
compelling
need
defenses
in
a
unilateral
change
unfair
labor
practice
case
derives
support
from
consideration
of
important
public
policies.
first,
the
effective
administration
of
the
statute
is
fostered
when
all
the
issues,
including
all
the
employer's
negotiability
defenses,
can
be
resolved
in
one
proceeding.
the
dispute
resolution
process
is
streamlined
in
the
congressional
purpose
of
facilitating
and
promoting
collective
bargaining
is
served.
but
furthermore,
and
indeed
the
d.c.
circuit
in
upholding
the
authority's
view
in
defense
logistics
agency
considered
the
second
point
perhaps
even
more
important
access
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
forum
affords
employees
and
their
union
access
to
appropriate
remedies
for
an
employer's
unilateral
change
in
working
conditions.
as
the
d.c.
circuit
pointed
out
in
that
case,
when
bargaining...
when
an
employer
refuses
to
bargain
during
ongoing
negotiations,
the
only
detriment
to
the
employee
is
that
the
employee
itself
is
not
able
to
better
or
change
the
status
quo,
so--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
well,
as
we
indicated
earlier,
the
purpose
of
section
7117
is
to
describe
the
scope
of
bargaining,
not
when
bargaining
arises,
and
so
any
of
the
particular
words
or
phrases
must
be
read
in
that
context.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
only
says
only,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
only
referring
to
the
substantive
evaluation
of
whether
there
is
a
compelling
need.
their
using
that
word
it
seems
to
me,
could...
is
at
least
an
overly
legalistic.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
word
were
the
governing
word
in
section
7117,
that
it
would
lead
to
results
even
beyond
those
described
here,
for
example.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
i
think
it
must
be
read
in
context.
it
cannot
be
taken
out
of
section
7117
in
its
entirety,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
provision,
placing
the
emphasis
on
that
word,
for
example,
could
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
that,
for
example,
when
an
agency
makes
alternative
arguments
about
a
single
bargaining
proposal
alleging
both
section
7117(b)
defenses
and
section
7117(c)
defenses,
that
the
authority
would
have
to
hold
two
proceedings
there.
but
of
course
the
authority
has
always,
and
has
never
been
subject
to
challenge
so
far
as
i
know,
conducted
unified
proceedings
addressing
all
negotiability
issues
in
one
proceeding,
and
it
would
also
seem
to
suggest
perhaps
that
every
agency
regulation
out
there
that
touches
on
conditions
of
employment
would
have
to
somehow
walk
through
the
authority's
door
before
bargaining
could
begin,
and
for
example...
and
there
is
certainly
no
thought
of
that
so
far
as
i
know
in
the
federal
sector
program.
in
fact,
the
fourth
circuit's
first
decision,
the
fort
belvoir
decision,
arose
when
the
subordinate
level
in
the
union
requested
a
waiver
of
the
higher
level
agency
and
the
waiver
was
denied,
but
certainly
it
describes
a
fact
pattern
where
parties
felt
free
to
seek
a
waiver
on
an
agency
regulation
rather
than
going
to
the
authority.
the
authority
said
that
only
it
and
only
in
that
proceeding
could
decide
a
compelling
need
issue.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
first
of
all
there
is
no
plain
language
that
would
assist
us,
unfortunately,
in
the
construction
of
these
statutory
terms,
and
that
even
if
they
were,
they
could
not
be
read
as
overriding
the
purposes
of
the
statute
as
a
whole.
finally,
i
would
just
want
to
note
that
there
are
no
drawbacks
resulting
from
the
authority's
practice
of
resolving
compelling
need
issues
in
unilateral
change
cases.
aberdeen's
suggestion
that
a
determination
of
compelling
need
issues
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
forum
somehow
restricts
the
agency
ability
to
regulate
its
affairs
is
simply
without
basis.
the
authority's
case
law
makes
clear
that
an
agency
is
not
barred
from
promulgating
regulations
or
even
from
disseminating
these
regulations
to
subordinate
levels
of
the
agency.
the
agency's
regulations
also
do
fix
the
rights
and
obligations
within
the
agency,
including
within
the
bargaining
unit,
unless
the
employer
and
the
union
agree
otherwise
in
collective
negotiations.
and
the
only
requirement
on
the
employer
is
the
statutory
one
to
bargain
before
implementation
of
the
agency
regulation
as
to
the
bargaining
unit.
further,
if
a
compelling
need
is
found
the
employer
will
not
be
required
to
bargain
over
inconsistent
proposals
and
even
if
there
is
no
compelling
need
found
and
the
authority
orders
that
the
change
be
rescinded,
such
a
remedy
would
only
deprive
the
employer
of
the
results
of
a
unilateral
change
that
it
should
have
not
made
in
the
first
place
without
bargaining.
in
short,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
opined
in
defense
logistics
agency,
the
authority
has
good
reasons
for
its
construction
of
its
enabling
statute,
reasons
that
are
firmly
rooted
in
the
terms
and
the
history
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
and
that
give
effect
to
both
the
negotiability
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
in
this
enactment.
we
respectfully
request
that
the
authority's
construction
of
the
statute
be
upheld,
and
also
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
just
a
few
brief
points
to
make.
first
of
all,
respondent
has
suggested
that
the
ideal
system
that
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
issuing
agency
as
a
necessary
party
to
any
compelling
need
determination
by
the
authority.
i
would
suggest
that
if
congress
had
that
ideal
system
in
mind
it
would
have
made
it
plain,
as
it
were,
by
requiring
that
in
the
statute,
but
in
fact
it
did
not.
the
only
reference
to
agencies
as
necessary
parties
are
when
the
authority
in
its
discretion
holds
hearings
under
section
7117(b),
and
the
authority
to
my
knowledge
ordinarily
does
not
and
in
fact
has
not
held
hearings
in
those
types...
in
that
type
of
appeal
procedure.
secondly,
i
would
again
just
emphasize
that
the
is
no
plain
language
in
7117.
there
is
not
a
single
word
that
directly
and
explicitly
discusses
the
relationship
between
section
7117
and
the
unfair
labor
practice
procedures.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes,
under
section
7117.
yes,
and
as
we
noted,
there
are...
in
our
brief
we
noted
the
number
of
cases
that
there
were,
and
that
by
far
those
are
cases
in
which
the
authority
has
not
found
compelling
need.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
the
ones
that
are
held
under
the
negotiability
procedure,
yes.
the
12
or
13
or
so
that
were
unfair
labor
practice
procedures,
unless
there
was
a
stipulated
record
in
some
of
them,
there
would
have
been
hearings,
and
the
agency,
if
it
were
named
as
a
party,
would
have
been
a
party,
and
could
have
asked
to
intervene
or
be
an
amicus
if
it
were
not.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
no,
the
authority
makes
the
compelling
need
determination,
not
the
issuing
agency.
the
authority
issues
the
regulations
and
applies
those
regulations.
secondly,
as
to
the
respondent's
point
that
the
authority
has
yet
to
make
an
argument
based
on
the
statute,
i
would
say
that
that
is
simply
incorrect,
and
would
direct
the
court's
attention
not
only
to
the
arguments
made
by
counsel
but
to
the
authority's
decision
which
discusses
explicit
terms
of
the
statute
and
decides
on
the
basis
of
those
terms
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
ongoing
negotiation
where
negotiability
defenses
must
be
raised
through
the
appeal
procedure
and
unilateral
change
situations
where
they
can
be
raised
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
procedure.
and
in
terms
of
the
respondent's
notion
that
congress
explicitly
considered
and
rejected
the
practice
that
we
have
suggested,
again,
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
wrong.
not
only
was
the
legislative
proposal
for
compelling
need
for
government-wide
regulations
not
enacted,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
those
types
of
negotiability
determinations
which
would
have
been
the
only
ones
left
under
that
legislative
proposal
could
not
be
made
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
in
a
unilateral
change
context.
it
simply
indicates,
and
in
fact
the
court
in
defense
logistics
agency
found
support
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
even
those
compelling
need
determinations
were
directed
only
at
the
ongoing
negotiations
scenario,
and
not
necessarily
at
the
unilateral
change
situation.
and
so
not
only
was
it
not...
not
enacted,
but
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
proposal
that
would
support
the
respondent's
argument
here,
and
in
terms
of
their
reliance
upon
the
difference
of
language
in
section
7117(b)
that
the
authority
shall
determine
compelling
need
issues
and
the
language
in
7117(c)
that
the
union
may
appeal,
we
would
point
out
that
those
provisions
simply
aren't
parallel,
and
contrary
to
the
respondent,
there
is
a
parallel
provision
in
section
7117(c)
which,
of
course,
directs
the
authority
that
it
shall
determine
those
issues,
too,
when
they
are
presented
to
the
authority.
that
provision
is
in
section
7117(c)(6).
whereas
the
language
7117(c)
simply
indicates
that
the
union
need
not
appeal
but
can
issue
a
counterproposal
or
bargain
on
the
employer's
proposal
or
withdraw
its
proposal
or
do
whatever
it
wishes
instead
of
appealing,
and
also
that
that
optional
language
prevents
the
15-day
time
limit
from
automatically
being
triggered
if
there
is
an
allegation
of
nonnegotiability
in
the
section
7117(c)
proceeding.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes,
indeed.
the
authority
makes
compelling
need
determinations,
not...
the
defense
department
is
certainly
the
issuing
agency,
but
the
authority
has
issued
the
regulations
that
list
the
criteria
for
making
these
determinations,
and
also
puts
the
burden
squarely
on
the
employer,
and
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
by
a
very
large
part
compelling
need
determinations
result
in
a
finding
that
there
is
no
compelling
need
for
the
agency
regulations.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
section
7117(a)(2)
is
the
section
upon
which
the
respondent
principally
relies.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
under
that
section
again
the
authority
applies...
the
same
criteria
govern
and
the
same
burden
is
on
the
employer
agency,
be
it
a
negotiability
determine
or
an
unfair
labor
practice
determination,
the
same
criteria
apply,
the
burden
remains
upon
the
employer
agency,
and
the
employer
agency
of
course--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
having
once
made
the
determination
with
respect
to
a
particular
regulation
as
how
it
fits
against
a
particular
proposal,
i
am
not
sure
that
there
would
be
any
need
to,
but
of
course
the
executive
order
addressed
the
notion
of
seriatim
proceedings
and
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
put
everything
in
one
proceeding,
and
the
authority
has
simply
continued
with
that
practice.
thank
you.
