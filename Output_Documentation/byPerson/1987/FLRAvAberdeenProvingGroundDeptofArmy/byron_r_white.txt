justice
white
mr.
robbins,
is
the
authority's
position
or
interpretation
of
the
statute
entitled
to
some
particular
deference?
i
know
you
can
argue
that
there's...
let's
assume
that
there's
room
in
the
statute
for
their
construction.
is
that
the
agency
that
is
charged
with
enforcing
this
statute?
is
it
entitled
to
deference?
justice
white
well,
of
course,
the
agency
that
is
supposed
to
determine
compelling
need
has
some
interest
in
it,
too.
is
that
the
defense
department
in
this
case?
justice
white
but
your
argument
is
that
there
is
just
not
room
for
the
agency's
construction?
justice
white
and
so
the
ball
bounces.
justice
white
yes,
but
if
judges
are
equally
divided
on
whether
this
is
plain
language
or
not,
that
may
be
enough
to
say
that
it
isn't
plain
at
all.
justice
white
you
are
saying
if
we
split
five
to
four
on
whether
there
is
plain
language,
if
five
say
it
is
plain
language
and
four
say
it
is
not
plain
language,
you
say
the
five
have
the
right
answer?
justice
white
what
if
the
agency
who
has...
what
if
the
defense
department,
at
the
same
time
this
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
going
on,
determines
that
there
is
a
compelling
need
for
the
regulation?
can
the
authority
come
to
a
different
conclusion?
justice
white
well,
the
statute
says
that
these
compelling
need
determinations
shall
be
made
only
in
accordance
with,
with...
what
is
the
section?
justice
white
well,
what
if
a
determination
is
made
pursuant
to
that
section?
justice
white
could
the
authority
redetermine
it
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding?
