that
is
purely
accidental.
it
may
be
and
it
may
not
be.
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but--
justice
scalia
--but
you
can't
be
assured
that
when
this
issue
of
necessity
is
raised,
the
highest
level
of
the
agency
will
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
to
it.
justice
scalia
that
is
nice
of
the
authority,
but
the
authority
wouldn't
have
to
do
that
if
it
didn't
want
to,
right?
justice
scalia
but
the
authority
wouldn't
have
to
if
it
didn't
want
to.
is
that...
yes
or
no?
justice
scalia
yes
or
no?
justice

congress
providing
explicitly
for
that
in
the
other
section
was
really
doing
something
that
is
entirely
superfluous.
if
all
you
say
is
true,
it
is
inevitable
that
those
opinions
would
be
heard.
congress
was
just
being
silly
in
the
other
section
explicitly
to
require
the
agency
head
to
have
a
word,
right?
justice
scalia
you
are
clearly
on
the
sg's
plain
language
team
this
week,
mr.
robbins.
i
am
glad
to
hear
that.

justice
scalia
and
yet
your
office
is
arguing
in
another
case
the
mere
fact
that
some
other
courts
had
come
out
another
way
and
that
some
courts
had
entered
a
stay
was...
do
you
know
the
case
i
am
talking
about?
justice
scalia
was
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
the
government's
position
was
a
responsible
position.
there
was
substantial
justification
for
it.
now,
why
couldn't
we
say
here
that
the
decision
of
this
panel
of
superb
judges
on
the
d.c.
circuit
is
per
se
evidence
that
this
is
a
reasonable
position,
and
since
it
is
a
reasonable
position
we
defer
to
the
agency?
justice
scalia
or
a
footnote
that
said,
we
mean
it,
or
something.
justice

ms.
peters,
can
i
ask--
justice
scalia
--has
the
authority
ever
found
no
compelling
need
without
holding
a
hearing?
you
say
they
have
never
held
a
hearing.
so
i
guess--
justice
scalia
--has
not
found
a
compelling
need.
justice
scalia
and
they
are
all
cases
without
hearings?
justice
scalia
yes,
that
is...
i
had
thought
that
perhaps
the
agency
would
only
hold
a
hearing
if
it
was...
as
many
courts
might,
that
they
would
be,
for
example,
very
reluctant
to
reverse
the
court
below
without
full
argument,
but
would
be
willing
to
affirm
without
setting
the
case
for
argument.
you
are
telling
me
that
that
is
not
the
key
to
whether
you
have
a
hearing
or
not.
