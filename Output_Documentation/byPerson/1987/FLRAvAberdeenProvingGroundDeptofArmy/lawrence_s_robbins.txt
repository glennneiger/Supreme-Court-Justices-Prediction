mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
authority
has
reached
an
interpretive
impasse
in
this
case
because
it
embarked
on
the
wrong
path
at
the
outset.
correctly
viewed,
this
case
does
not
require
the
court
to
seek
out
private
labor
law
analogs
or
delve
into
pre-act
legislative
history
or
balance
free-floating
notions
of
efficiency
or
general
public
policy.
this
is
instead
a
case
about
the
plain
meaning
of
a
statute
that
speaks
directly
to
the
question
presented
and
answers,
and
the
answer
that
the
statute
provides
is
this.
a
proceeding
under
section
7117(b)
is
the
only
means
by
which
to
challenge
the
compelling
need
for
an
agency-wide
regulation
when
such
a
regulation
is
asserted
as
a
bar
to
federal
sector
collective
bargaining.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
statute
itself.
right
up
front,
section
7117(a)(2)
states
that
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
shall
extend
to
matters
that
are
the
subject
of
agency-wide
regulations
only
if
the
authority
has
determined
under
subsection
(b)
there
is
no
compelling
need
for
the
regulation
at
issue.
these
words
are
not
silent,
nor
are
they,
as
the
authority
suggests
in
its
reply
brief,
merely
the
starting
point
for
analysis.
only
if
the
authority
has
determined
the
compelling
need
issue
does
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
arise
at
all
with
respect
to
agency-wide
regulation
matters,
and
only,
as
the
fourth
circuit
put
it
in
the
fort
belvoir
decision,
is
a
"highly
singular"
word.
it
doesn't
suggest
that
there
are
lots
of
other
ways
to
do
the
same
thing,
and
as
we
read
the
statute
and
as
we
read
its
plain
language,
unless
and
until
that
compelling
need
determination
has
been
made
there
is
simply
no
duty
to
bargain
at
all
with
respect
to
matters
covered
by
the
regulations,
and
thus
the
authority's
assertion
throughout
its
brief
that
there
is
this
thing
called
a
continuing
duty
to
bargain
is
misplaced
in
this
context
because
the
bargaining
duty
cannot
continue
unless
and
until
it
first
arises,
and
it
doesn't
arise
under
the
statute
until
the
compelling
need
determination
has
been
made,
and
not
just
made
in
any
way
the
authority
sees
fit
to
make
it.
it
says
quite
explicitly
it
must
be
made
under
subsection
(b),
not
in
the
ulp
forum,
not
in
any
other
forum,
under
subsection
(b),
and
until
that
determination
has
been
made,
the
ulp
process
simply
cannot
get
under
way.
we
believe
the
language
is
plain,
and
that
its
purpose
is
evident
and
quite
sensible,
for
the
ulp
process
is
manifestly
inappropriate
for
resolving
disputes
concerning
the
compelling
need
for
agency-wide
regulations,
and
the
facts
of
this
case
illustrate
my
point.
here
a
federal
agency,
the
department
of
defense
and
its
primary
national
subdivision,
the
department
of
the
army,
promulgated
regulations
governing
anticipated
closures
at
agency
facilities.
the
machinists
and
aerospace
workers
contended
that
those
regulations
lacked
a
compelling
need.
when
it
made
that
claim,
it
asserted
in
effect
two
propositions,
first,
that
the
army
and
the
defense
department
could
not
apply
the
regulations,
their
regulations
in
a
particular
case
that
they
plainly
intended
to
cover,
and
second,
that
the
local
employer,
here
aberdeen
proving
grounds,
may
not
follow
a
regulation
that
its
parent
agency
explicitly
directed
it
to
obey.
a
union
asserts
both
such
propositions
every
time
it
asserts
that
an
agency-wide
regulation
lacks
a
compelling
need,
and
in
our
judgment
that
tells
us
two
things
about
what
an
ideal
system
ought
to
look
like
for
resolving
compelling
need.
first,
the
ideal
system
ought
to
entitle
the
agency
that
issued
the
regulation
a
chance
to
be
heard
on
the
question
whether
its
regulation
has
a
compelling
justification
and
deserves
to
be
applied
according
to
its
terms.
it
shouldn't
just
be
a
fortuity.
it
shouldn't
just
be
up
to
the
agency
if
it
feels
like
it.
it
should
be
right
in
the
statute
and
be
required.
and
second,
the
system,
the
ideal
system
should
not
saddle
the
local
employer
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
simply
because
it
obeyed
a
regulation
that
its
parent
agency
directed
it
to
follow,
and
in
our
view
that
is
just
exactly
the
system
that
congress
enacted.
first,
section
7117(a)(2)
says
that
there
is
no
duty
to
bargain
unless
and
until
the
authority
has
made
a
compelling
need
determination
under
subsection
(b)
and
that
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
the
local
employer
cannot
be
charged
with
the
ulp
simply
because
it
has
followed
its
parent's
regulations.
second,
section
7117(b)
creates
a
procedure
that
entitles
the
issuing
agency
to
be
heard
on
the
question
whether
its
regulation
passes
the
compelling
need
test.
under
subsection
(b)(3)
a
hearing
may
be
heard
at
which
the
issuing
agency
is
a
necessary
party,
at
which
the
general
counsel
who
is
the
prosecutor
in
the
ulp
forum
is
not
entitled
to
be
present,
and
in
which
the
only
issue
to
be
determined
is
the
question
of
compelling
need.
now,
earlier
during
the
argument
i
believe
justice
o'connor
put
a
question
to
ms.
peters
concerning
whether
there
is
any
relevant
legislative
history.
we
believe
there
is,
and
it
is
not
just
legislative
history
of
the
sort
that
is
a
filigree
on
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
but
it
was
congress's
explicit
answer
to
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
now,
to
be
sure,
as
ms.
peters
notes,
correctly,
the
answer
was
given
in
the
context
of
a
predecessor
statute,
one
in
which
the
compelling
need
language
was
used
with
respect
to
government-wide
regulations
and
not
agency-wide
regulations,
but
the
statutory
language
with
respect
to
compelling
need
was
identical.
it
was
the
same
exact
substantive
test,
the
compelling
need
procedures
were
identical,
and
the
house
took
up
the
question
whether
the
ulp
forum
would
be
available
to
resolve
the
compelling
need
questions
for
government-wide
regulations,
and
this
is
the
answer
they
gave:
"the
committee
intends
that
disputes
concerning
the
negotiability
of
proposals
and
matters
affecting
working
conditions
except
for
questions
of
compelling
need
under
section
7117
be
resolved
through
the
filing
and
processing
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
under
section
7116
and
7118.
"
that
is
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
now,
that
answer
doesn't
go
away
simply
because
congress
didn't
enact
the
version
of
section
7117
that
was
in
the
house
bill.
indeed,
there
is
good
reason
to
think
the
answer
is
even
more
relevant
given
what
they
did
subsequently,
because
the
scope
of
the
bargaining
obligation
got
smaller
after
the
house
bill
was
put
in.
the
government-wide
regulations
became
a
complete
bar
to
negotiations,
and
agency-wide
regulations,
which
had
previously
not
been
a
bar
at
all
under
the
prior
bill,
became
a
bar
to
the
extent
they
were
justified
by
compelling
need.
so
the
fact,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
prior
bill
didn't
become
law
doesn't
argue
for
overlooking
the
meaning
that
the...
or
in
this
case
the
house
of
representatives
imposed
on
the
identical
language
that
confronts
the
court
this
morning.
let
me
say
also
with
respect
to
the
7117(c)
argument
that
has
been
made,
the
authority
takes
the
view,
and
has
taken
the
view
this
morning
that
because
under
section
7117(c)
there
are
these
optional
alternative
procedures
either
in
the
ulp
forum
or
in
the
so-called
negotiability
appeal
forum,
that
therefore
the
same
option
ought
to
exist
with
respect
to
compelling
need,
we
don't
think
the
plain
language
of
those
statutes
can
absorb
that
argument.
indeed,
in
our
view
the
contrast
between
these
provisions
underscores
the
argument
we
make
this
morning.
for
unlike
section
7117(b)
which
states
that
the
authority
shall
determine
compelling
need
in
any
collective
bargaining
dispute
in
which
it
arises,
section
7117(c)
provides
that
if
with
respect
to
any
other
negotiability
dispute
an
agency
alleges
that
there
is
no
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith,
the
union
may
appeal
under
the
expedited
negotiability
procedures
detailed
in
the
balance
of
section
7117(c).
there
is
no
language
in
section
(c)
that
is
comparable
to
that
in
section
(b),
nothing
that
is...
that
commands
the
authority
that
it
shall
determine
negotiability
when
a
compelling
need
issue
is
the
bar
that
is
asserted
by
the
agency,
and
nor
for
that
matter
does
section
7117(c)
state
as
(a)(2)
does
that
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
does
not
arise
at
all
unless
and
until
the
authority
has
determined
the
negotiability
issue
in
the
expedited
compelling
need
process.
all
section
7117(c)
does
is
to
give
the
union
an
option,
an
option
that
finds
no
analogy
whatever
in
the
compelling
need
provisions.
we
believe
that
contrast
is
significant.
the
fact
that
congress
carved
out
one
type
of
negotiability
dispute
in
which
it
made
an
affirmative
demand
to
the
authority
that
it
shall
determine
it
and
determine
it
in
a
particular
way,
and
in
all
other
negotiability
cases
gave
an
explicit
option
to
resort
to
either
forum
suggests
that
congress
didn't
simply
back
into
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
but
chose
and
chose
deliberately.
and
as
i
suggested
before,
it
chose
wisely,
because
compelling
need
determinations
for
agency-wide
regulations
are
an
unusual
and
unique
type
of
dispute
which
deserves
and
ought
to
be
resolved
in
a
special
expedited
forum
in
which
the
issuing
agency
has
the
right,
the
statutory
right
to
be
present.
let
me
say
a
brief
word
about
the
argument
the
authority
makes
with
respect
to
the
executive
order
practice.
this
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
suggests
that
because
there
existed
under
the
executive
order
regime
a
right
in
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor
to
decide
all
negotiability
issues,
that
that
same
power
must
reside
in
an
alj
to
decide
compelling
need
questions
in
the
ulp
forum.
that
argument,
we
believe,
is
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
misstates
the
historical
record.
it
is
true,
to
be
sure,
that
executive
order
11838
gave
the
assistant
secretary
the
power
to
decide
negotiability
issues
that
had
previously
arisen
during
disputes
but
which
had
theretofore
been
outside
his
jurisdiction.
but
there
is
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
that
that
power
also
entitled
him
to
decide
compelling
need
questions
in
particular.
quite
the
contrary
is
the
case.
for
at
the
same
time
that
executive
order
11838
empowered
the
assistant
secretary
to
decide
negotiability
questions
in
general,
it
also
created
a
separate
and
distinct
and
quite
detailed
procedure
for
resolving
the
compelling
need
for
agency-wide
regulations
in
particular.
previously
agency
regulations
had
been
a
complete
bar
to
negotiations
under
the
executive
order
practice.
executive
order
11838
relaxed
that
limitation
but
did
so
in
a
particular
and,
we
believe,
in
a
deliberate
compromise
fashion
by
giving
the
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
labor
relation
council,
the
authority's
predecessor,
and
only
under
particular
procedural
circumstances.
there
is
no
hint
that
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor
also
inherited
that
new
power
at
the
same
time.
but
even
if
the
authority's
interpretation
of
the
executive
order
practice
were
correct,
and
we
believe
it
isn't,
there
is
no
persuasive
reason
to
think
that
congress
intended
to
enact
the
same
procedure,
for
it
didn't
adopt
the
language,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
observed
in
the
decision
in
fort
belvoir,
congress
clearly
had
this
executive
order
practice
before
it
when
it
enacted
title
vii,
and
yet
far
from
adopting
the
same
procedures,
it
instead
adopted
the
language
that
we
now
find
in
section
(a)(2)
and
(b).
the
authority
offers
no
convincing
explanation
how
the
superseded
language
of
the
executive
order,
which
in
our
view
it
in
any
event
misconstrues,
can
overcome
the
plain
meaning
of
the
compelling
need
provision.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
is
entitled
to
deference,
justice
white.
there
is,
i
should
say,
justice
white--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--in
this
case
it
is...
well,
there
are
two
regulations
at
issue
that
are
parallel
and
overlapping.
there
is
an
army
regulation,
which
is
the
primary
national
subdivision,
and
the
other
one
is
the
defense
department
regulation.
we
don't
dispute
that
there
is
deference
due
to
the
authority.
indeed,
this
court
made
that
quite
clear
in
the
batf
case
in--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--it
is
just
not...
it
is
not
in
the
ball
park.
i
mean,
their
construction
couldn't
be,
i
think,
more
plainly
precluded.
i
might
suggest
that
there
is
at
least
some
suggestion
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
did
not
expect
the
ordinary
rules
of
deference
to
apply
with
respect
to
the
flra.
i
am
referring
now
to
remarks
made
by
congressman
ford
after
the
adoption
of
title
vii
in
which
he
said
that
he
expected
the
courts
will
scrutinize
the
actions
of
the
authority
with
less
of
the
deference
given
to
other
administrative
agencies.
we
don't
take
that
position
here
this
morning.
we
think
it
doesn't
square
with
batf.
but
we
don't
think
deference
is
a
problem
for
us.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
you
won't
hear
holy
trinity
from
me
this
morning.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
can
tell
you
i
think
what
it
means
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
no,
i
think
it--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
it
means
what
this
court
has
said
it
means
in
chevron
and
cardoza-fonseca,
which
means
at
least
this
much,
that
when
the
authority
is
construing,
in
the
process
of
construing
plain
language,
and
gives
in
this
case
what
it
believes
the
plain
language
means,
if
this
court
applying
the
ordinary
canons
of
statutory
construction
determines
on
the
contrary
that
there
is
a
plain
meaning
to
the
statute
that
is
contrary
to
the
agency's
interpretation,
it
must
go
with
the
statute
and
not
with
the
agency.
that
is
what
has
happened
here.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
can
sign
off
on
the
second
one
without
fear
of
contradiction,
i
think.
you
should
certainly
listen
to
them.
they
have
been
working
with
the
statute,
but
they
just
got
it
wrong
here,
and
they
got
it
so
far
wrong
in
the
face
of
a
statute
that
is
so--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
deference
means
that,
for
example,
if
you
came
to
the
view
that
the
statute
was
silent
on
a
particular
matter
or
that
there
were
two
fairly
available
constructions,
sure,
the
implementing
agency
has
the
primary
call
on
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
don't
see
it
as
such
a
hobson's
choice.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interpretation--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--if
ours
is
the
one
that
in
your
judgment
the
statute
plainly
requires,
you
have
got
to
take
hours.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--sure.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
am
sorry,
justice
marshall?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
no.
well,
i
suppose
it
is...
there
is
no
problem
framing
the
opinion
in
a
way
that
respects
the
arguments
and
the
policy
judgments
that
the
authority
has
made,
but
our
view
is
that
in
the
final
analysis
there
is
no
way
to
construe
section
(a)(2)
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
regulations
and
the
practices
that
the
authority
has
offered
this
morning.
i
am
continually
struck
by
the
fact
that
after
all
the
briefs
have
been
submitted
and
after
the
arguments
have
been
made,
the
court
has
yet
to
hear
an
argument
based
on
the
statute
from
the
authority
here,
and
that
suggests
that
all
the
deference
in
the
world
can't
save
an
analysis
that
is
completely
untethered.
there
is
no
language--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no.

[generallaughter.]
no,
they
are
excellent
judges.
i
think
they
regarded
it
as
a
close
call.
i
mean,
they
sort
of
said,
well,
you
know,
the
authority
makes
arguments
x
and
those
are
okay.
they
are
no
great
shakes,
but
the
arguents
on
the
other
side
don't
really
overcome
them,
so
we
will
flip
a
coin
and
the
authority
gets
deference.
i
think
some
of
the
arguments
that
we
have
tried
to
suggest
to
the
court
in
our
briefs
were
not
made
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
nobody,
for
example,
uncovered
the
quote
from
the
house
report
that
we
think
is
a
definitive
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
correct.
i
believe
the
d.c.
circuit
got
it
wrong,
and
got
it
wrong
just
as
far
as
the
authority
has
and
in
just
the
same
ways.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
it
is
now
in
this
court,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plain
language
is
all
we
need,
but
in
this
case
we
can
rest
on
quite
a
number
of
other
bases
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
don't
think
so,
justice
white.
judges
get
things
wrong.
0
[generallaughter.]
and
people
disagree
about
very
difficult
issues
as
to
which
there
is
nevertheless
a
clearly
correct
answer.
i
don't
regard
the
existence
of
a
dispute
as
much
evidence
that
the
dispute
doesn't
have
an
answer
and
that
the
answer
isn't
a
clearly
correct
one.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
would,
of
course,
if
it
is
my
answer.

i
think
the
court
split
in
cardoza-fonseca,
which
as
i
recollect
was
a
plain
language
decision.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
do.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
among
other
things,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
eja
statute
that
we
were
attempting
to
argue
about
in
that
other
case
responds
to
many
different
concerns,
and
whether
or
not
attorneys'
fees
ought
to
go
to
the
prevailing
party
doesn't
necessarily
raise
quite
the
same
question
as
whether
congress
meant
what
it
said
when
it
used
words
like
(b)>
["].
it
seems
to
me
congress
couldn't
have
said
what
it
meant
any
more
clearly.
i
have
been
trying
to
think
of
another
statute
they
could
have
written.
i
suppose
they
could
have
said,
by
the
way,
if
the
authority
ever
promulgates
regulations
like
24
or
24.3,
toss
them
out
on
their
ear.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
we
are
not
kidding.
these
are
real
things.
they
could
have
put
it
in
italics.
but
i
think
they
did
a
good
enough
job.
indeed,
i
think
it
is
sufficiently
clear
that
there
is
really
no
need
to
turn
to
the
very
definitive
legislative
history.
let
me
just
say
that
in
conclusion
that
the
error
in
our
judgment
that
the
authority
has
made
today
is
the
same
one
it
made
in
batf
that
came
before
this
court
five
years
ago,
and
though
it
requests
this
court's
deference,
we
believe
what
this
court
said
in
that
case
remains
true
today.
the
deference
owed
to
an
expert
tribunal
cannot
be
allowed
to
slip
into
a
judicial
inertia
which
results
in
the
unauthorized
assumption
by
an
agency
of
major
policy
decisions
properly
made
by
congress.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
