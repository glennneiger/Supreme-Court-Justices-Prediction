doesn't
deference
mean,
listen,
that
is
all?
justice
marshall
well,
what
else?
justice
marshall
well,
suppose
one
construction
is
yours
and
one
is
the
agency's.
which
one
do
we
take?
justice
marshall
well,
assuming
it
is
a
choice,
which
one
should
we
take?
justice
marshall
and
say
with
all
deference
we
take
the
opposing
position.
but
i
think
you
say
we
have
to
say
with
all
deference
we
oppose
your
position.
we
reject
your
position.
justice
marshall
but
if
we
don't
put
that
language
in
there
it
is
wrong?
justice
marshall
if
we
don't
use
in
deference
language
we
are
