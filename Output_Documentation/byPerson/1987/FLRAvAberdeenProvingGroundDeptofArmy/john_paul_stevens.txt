i
didn't
think
so.
mr.
robbins,
what
does
the
word
"deference"
mean?
does
that
mean
we
must
take
what
they
say,
or
we
just
pay
some
attention
to
it,
or
there
is
strong...
what
do
you
think
it
means?
justice
stevens
it
means
that
we
pay
no
attention
to
them.
justice
stevens
to
what
extent
should
we
respect
their
views?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
does
that
mean
we
gave
them
no
deference,
or
we
gave
them
deference,
but
having
given
them
deference
we
still
concluded
they
were
wrong?
justice
stevens
but
you
know,
three
pretty
good
judges
came
to
the
other
conclusion,
three
excellent
judges,
i
should
say,
came
to
the
other
conclusion
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
maybe
we
shouldn't
defer
to
them,
either.
why
are
you
pausing?
you
are
not
pausing
as
to
whether
they
were
excellent
judges?
justice
stevens
no,
but
they
quote
the
plain
language
right
out
at
the
beginning
and
say
this
is
the
plain
language,
and
then
they
go
right
by
it.
they
do
meet
head
on
the
plain
language
argument.
your
position
is,
you
don't
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
at
all.
