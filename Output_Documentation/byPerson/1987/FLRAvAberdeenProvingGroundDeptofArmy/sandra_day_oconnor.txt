justice
o'connor
ms.
peters,
this
case
arose
out
of
one
day's
work,
the
decision
of
the
respondent
to
close
down
on
the
day
after
thanksgiving
in
1981?
justice
o'connor
and
the
union
still
wants
to
bargain
over
that?
justice
o'connor
so
if
you
win,
then
there
will
be
some
kind
of
bargaining
about
that
one
day
in
1981
presumably?
justice
o'connor
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
is
there
some
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
congress
considered
and
rejected
the
very
position
that
you
are
taking
today
on
behalf
of
the
authority?
justice
o'connor
now,
if
a...
if
the
sg
is
right,
then
i
take
it
the
agency
head,
that
would
be
the
department
of
defense
in
this
case,
would
have
an
opportunity
to
come
before
the
hearing
and
make
the
presentation
on
the
compelling
need
for
the
particular
regulation.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
were
just
decided
in...
as
part
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
question,
then
i
take
it
the
department
of
defense
in
this
case
would
not
be
a
party
to
that
and
wouldn't
be
able
to
appear
and
argue
about
the
need
for
its
regulation.
