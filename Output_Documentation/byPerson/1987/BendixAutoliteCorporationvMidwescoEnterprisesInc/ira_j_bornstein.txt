mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
counsel
indicated,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
very
simply
whether
or
not
the
ohio
tolling
statute
is
what
has
been
construed
as
a
forced
licensure
provision.
and
as
counsel
concedes,
each
and
every
court
which
has
been
faced
with
this
provision
or
a
similar
provision
has
found
it
to
be
a
constitutional
violation.
that
includes
the
lower
courts
here
as
well
as
the
courts
in
the
coons
case,
as
well
as
the
mckinley
court.
and
the
question
that
we
have
to
look
at,
as
the
court
indicated
in
hughes
versus
oklahoma,
is
the
practical
operation
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
focus,
and
what
you
have
to
look
at
is,
there
is
a
tolling
statute
here,
and
the
tolling
statute
says
that
in
order
to
obtain
its
benefits
there
must
be
physical
presence
in
the
state.
now,
even
though
it
is
somewhat
of
an
anachronism
as
we
pointed
out,
ohio
may
very
well
be
the
only
state
now
that
holds
that
physical
presence
in
the
state
is
not
the
equivalent
to
being
subject
to
service
under
the
longarm
jurisdiction.
it
is
only
the
same
as
actual
physical
service
within
the
confines
of
the
state.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
bendix
had
the
defendant,
midwesco,
served
under
longarm,
and
because
of
that
fact
and
the
fact
that
there
must
be
physical
presence,
it
is
necessary
to
see
how
that
physical
presence
can
be
obtained,
and
the
only
means
and
manner
in
which
it
can
be
done
is
via
the
qualifications
statute
of
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
i
agree,
and
i
believe
what
the
court
said
is
incorrect.
i
don't
believe
that
in
the
ohio
foreign
corporation
act
that
is
possible.
the
ohio
foreign--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--well,
what
the
sixth
circuit
said
is
that
they
could
have
put
their
provision
in
there.
they
didn't
state
and
did
not
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
validity
of
such
a
provision.
they
merely
stated
that
there
could
have
been
such
a
provision
in
there,
and
in
fact
i
believe
that
there
would
not
have
been
any
validity
because
it
would
allow
a
corporation
to
easily
circumvent
the
entire
corporate
scheme
setup
in
the
state
of
ohio.
one
could
easily
then
engage
in
business
by
going
ahead
and
entering
into
these
agreements,
these
side
agreements
without
having
to
become
qualified
and
appoint
an
agent.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
if
it
can
be
done
that
easily,
it
would
be
less
of
a
burden.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
it
would
be
helpful
to
know.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
no,
i
don't
believe
we
are,
because
in
searle
the
reason
that
they
were
stuck
was
there
was
what
was
considered
to
be
a
footnote
in
the
velmohos
case
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
possibly
there
were
other
means
in
which
it
could
be
done,
and
in
fact
after
remand,
and
coons
turned
out
to
be
the
culmination
of
searle,
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
found
there
was
no
other
way,
and
in
fact
the
same
argument
that
there
could
have
been
some
type
of
contractual
provision
was
raised
in
coons,
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
said
it
can't
be
done.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
that's
correct,
but
ohio
has
the
same
type
of
foreign
corporation
act,
almost
identical.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
well,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
all
that
they
were
stating
was
that
the
provision
could
have
been
in
there,
and
i
believe
that
because
of
the
fact
the
provision
was
not
in
there
and
therefore
it
was
moot,
they
were
not
going
to
issue
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
valid,
but
we
did
raise
the
argument
in
the
sixth
circuit
before
the
court
that
under
the
ohio
statutory
scheme
it
would
not
be
valid
and
it
would
allow
one
to
circumvent
it.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
they
did
not
make
any
statement
in
there
one
way
or
the
other.
as
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
under
section
1703.041
of
the
ohio
code
one
is
required
to
appoint
a
statutory
agent
in
order
to
transact
business
within
the
state,
and
the
effect
of
that
provision,
as
ohio
recognizes,
is
that
a
foreign
corporation
would
become
subject
to
the
general
jurisdiction
of
ohio
courts
for
any
and
all
transitory
causes
of
action,
and
the
courts
in
the
cases
we
have
cited
have
pointed
out
that
the
only
thing
that
they
would
look
to
then
is
whether
or
not
the
corporate
defendant
could
be
served
within
the
confines
of
the
state.
that
is
it.
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
plaintiff
resides
in
the
state
or
not.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
could
be
served.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
if
they
have
an
office
within
the
state
then
they
are
able
to
be
physically
served
within
the
state.
it
is
not
the
same
thing.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
then
that
would
comply.
they
could
be
served
in
the
state.
we
could
not
be
served
within
the
state.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
but
they
can't
be--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--well,
the
thing
is
that
in
this
instance
there
wasn't
one,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
can
be
compelled
to
come
in
and
appoint
an
agent
within
the
state.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
no,
i
don't
mean...
when
i
said
that--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--no,
because
there
is
still
physical
presence
within
the
state.
if
there
is
physical
presence
within
the
state
under
the
tolling
statute
then
you
can
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
tolling
statute.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
because
under...
the
only
way
you
can
appoint
an
agent
though
is
under
the
statutory
scheme.
you
can
have
it
under
an
agent
but
the
agents
have
to
be
appointed
under
the
ohio
foreign
corporation
act.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
because
looking
at
the
ohio
statutory
scheme,
that
is
the
only
way,
that
is
the
only
provision
anywhere
that
it
is
stated
how
a
foreign
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
can
appoint
an
agent.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
if
they
are
going
to
transact
business
within
the
state
of
ohio.
if
they
are
going
to
transact
business.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
if
you
are
a
foreign
corporation
i
believe
that
that
is
the
only
way.
i
have
not
seen
any
other
means
or
mode,
and
there
hasn't
been
any
other
which
has
been
suggested
by
bendix
in
this
case.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
that's
correct.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
fostoria,
ohio.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
it
consisted
of
installing
a
boiler,
having
people
there
and
literally
constructing
a
boiler.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
shipping
it
in
from
illniois
to
ohio,
and,
your
honor,
there
is
a
statute,
section
1703.02
of
the
ohio
code
which
says
that
a
foreign
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
which
comes
into
the
state
to
construct
any
type
of
machinery
or
equipment
is
still
considered
to
be
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
is
not
subject
to
the
qualification
provisions
of
the
statutory
scheme,
and
there
is
no
doubt
under
the
statutory
scheme
that
midwesco
was
still
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
and
would
not
otherwise
have
been
subject
to
qualification.
by
becoming
registered...
if,
as
our
position
is
that
you
must
become
registered
and
you
must
have
an
agent,
a
statutory
agent,
and
by
doing
that
under
the
ohio
law
in
essence
a
party
such
as
midwesco
is
being
forced
to
give
up
its
due
process
and
its
defenses
based
on
personal
jurisdiction,
because
once
there
is
someone
there
then
they
have
submitted
themselves
to
the
ohio
courts,
and
not
just...
i
mean,
the
effects
on
interstate
commerce
are
just
tremendous
if
one
thinks
about
that,
because
if
various
states
forced
these
types
of
requirements
upon
a
corporation,
then
they
could
become
subject
to
lawsuits
throughout
the
united
states
despite
the
fact
that
the
interstate
corporation
has
no
contact
with
the
forum
state.
merely
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
appointed
an
agent
in
order
to
comply,
they
could
be
defending
lawsuit
throughout
the
whole
50
united
states,
and
not
just
states
like
ohio.
midwesco
has
done
jobs
in
alaska.
they
could
be
sued
in
alaska
for
auto
accidents.
they
could
be
sued
in
puerto
rico.
they
could
be...
throughout
the
country,
and
they
would
be
forced
to
incur
the
cost
of
defending
cases
throughout
this
country
all
because
of
this.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
no,
i
believe
it
would
still
end
up
being
the
same
thing.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
but
the
problem
is
that
under
the
ohio
statutory
scheme
ohio
case
law
said
that
by
appointing
an
agent
within
the
state,
an
agent
gives
you
presence,
and
therefore
you
are
submitting
to
general
jurisdiction.
therefore
even
if
they
did
this
midwesco
would
in
essence
be
submitting
to
the
general
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
ohio.
it
is
not
just
because
of
the
qualification.
it
is
because
of
the
fact
that
if
they
were
still
required
to
appoint
an
agent,
that
agent
would
subject
them
to
jurisdiction
for
any
and
all
actions.
it
wouldn't
just
be
for
this
particular
action,
and
therefore
the
effect,
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
would
still
be
the
same.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
that
is
because
in
fact
the
corporation
has
agreed,
has
gone
in
and
established
a
physical--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
now,
as
far
as
these
forced
licensure
provisions,
this
court
has
long
held
these
provisions
to
be
unconstitutional,
and
unlike
what
counsel
for
bendix
has
said,
this
court
has
not
focused
on
the
sanctions.
this
court
has
focused
on
the
conditions.
in
fact,
recently
in
eli
lilly
versus
savon
drugs
this
court
pointed
out
that
it
was
the
conditions,
the
regulatory
conditions
that
were
being
looked
at,
and
it
was
not
the
sanctions
at
the
end,
and
in
fact
in
that
case
the
court
stated
that
it
is
well
established
that
new
jersey
cannot
require
lilly
to
get
a
certificate
of
authority
to
do
business
in
the
state
if
its
participation
in
this
trade
is
limited
to
its
wholly
interstate
sales
to
new
jersey.
there
is
no
limitation
or
qualification
on
the
sanction.
this
court
has
long
held,
going
back
to
1914,
quite
some
time
ago,
long
before
the
interstate
trade
developed
it
the
way
it
is
right
now,
in
sioux
remedy
versus
cope,
that
a
provision
such
as
this
was
unconstitutional.
sioux
remedy,
the
court
focused
on
the
condition,
and
interestingly
enough,
70
years
ago,
in
excess
of
70
years
ago
the
conditions
were
exactly
the
same.
the
condition
was
that
the
corporation
has
to
become
qualified
to
transact
business,
had
to
appoint
a
statutory
agent
and
became
subject
to
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
and
this
court
looked
at
that
and
said
that
the
conditions
being
imposed
were
much
too
great,
and
justice
vander
vanter,
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
prescience,
kind
of
foretold
the
future
in
that
case.
he
stated
that
if
one
state
can
impose
such
a
condition,
others
can,
and
in
that
way
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
can
be
subjected
to
great
embarrassment
and
serious
hazards,
and
that
was
in
1914.
here
we
are
in
1988.
trade
is
not
only
interstate
it
is
international,
and
those
burdens,
those
hazards,
that
embarrassment
has
only
disproportionately
increased
over
the
years.
it
is
also
necessary
to
keep
in
mind
the
entire
purpose
and
idea
behind
the
commerce
clause,
this
idea
of
preventing
economic
balkanization,
that
the
states
are
not
separate
economic
units,
and
that
you
cannot
keep
corporations
out
of
states
and
prevent
them
from
transacting
business.
as
the
court
stated
in
international
textbook
versus
pigg,
the
court
said
that
one
cannot
impose
a
condition
upon
a
corporation
of
another
state
seeking
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
kansas,
which
is
a
case
of
interstate
business,
and
which
is
a
regulation
of
interstate
commerce,
and
directly
burdens
on
such
commerce.
again,
it
is
the
conditions
that
are
being
focused
on.
it
is
not
the
sanctions.
it
is
not
the
fact
that
one
is
being
barred
from
the
courthouse
door.
it
is
the
fact
that
one
is
being
conditioned
to
become
registered,
become
licensed
within
the
state
in
order
to
transact
that
interstate
business.
and
even
though
the
courts
found,
and
we
believe
rightfully
found,
that
there
is
a
per
se
violation
here,
even
if
one
were
to
apply
the
test,
the
balancing
test
of
pike
versus
bruce
church,
it
is
our
belief,
as
we
have
already
set
out,
that
that
test
clearly
indicates
that
there
has
been
a
burden
upon
interstate
commerce,
because
of
the
fact
that
one
must
weigh
the
consequences,
and
the
only
effect
as
far
as
the
state
goes,
the
state
interest
that
has
been
established
here,
is
that
which
this
court
found
in
searle,
which
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
certain
interest
in
having
one
served
or
be
able
to
be
served
within
the
state.
however,
some
of
which
i
have
already
touched
upon,
the
effect
upon
interstate
commerce
here
is
great,
because
of
the
fact
it
will
subject
a
corporation
to
the
jurisdiction
of
potentially
lawsuits
within
all
50
states
if
all
50
states
should
choose
to
enact
similar
statutes
such
as
the
state
of
ohio
has
done.
and
the
effects
on
interstate
commerce
that
we
noted
in
our
brief,
this
case
is
a
construction
of--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--it
could
submit
you
to
jurisdiction
within
the
state
if
someone
should
choose
to
sue
you
there.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
but
if
you
have
been
forced
to
become
registered
and
have
an
agent
there
then
obviously--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--that
is
correct,
but
what
they've
done
is,
they've
taken--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--if
you
don't
register--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--well,
except
the
problem
is,
the
statute
as
drafted
allows
you
to
remain
liable
in
perpetuity,
and
if
you
are
a
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
the
odds
are
that
they
eventually
will
find
you,
and
they
could
find
you
in
50
years
or
just
choose
to
wait
50
years
to
find
you,
or
to
serve
you,
and
then
you
would
become
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
because
there
is
no
type
of
time
limitation
set
forth
in
this
at
all.
this
statute
is
as
broad
as
could
be.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
unfortunately,
you
don't
have
the
benefit
of
that,
and
therefore
even
though
they
could
serve
you
under
longarm
they
could
choose
to
wait
10,
20,
30,
or
40
years,
and
the
effects,
as
we
point
out,
this
is
a
construction
case.
i
mean
there
are
bonding
companies,
surety
bonding
companies,
insurance
companies
that
are
involved
in
cases
such
as
this,
and
what
would
the
effect
be
if
this
statute
were
to
be
upheld
and
the
principles
were
to
be
liable
in
perpetuity?
you
wouldn't
find
surety
companies
or
bonding
companies
that
are
willing
to
undertake
that
kind
of
liability
if
their
principal
could
be
sued
in
50
years.
who
is
going
to
even
be
around
to
know
that
the
case
was
about?
what
kind
of
witnesses
will
they
have?
and
how
could
these
companies
go
ahead
and
undertake
this
kind
of
liability
when--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--definitely.
if
they...
if
the
insurance
companies
or
bonding
companies
themselves
would
be
forced
to
be
defending
these
cases
potentially
in
myriad
states
throughout
the
country,
they
wouldn't
be
willing
to
bond
these
and
these
interstate
corporations
would
be
unable
to
come
within
states
such
as
ohio
and
engage
in
their
interstate
business.
and
the
other,
the
last
part
of
the
pike
versus
bruce
church
test
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
to
be
narrow,
it
has
to
be
as
narrow
as
could
be,
and
in
fact
this
statute
is
the
exact
opposite.
it
is
as
broad
as
possible.
it
states
that
it
is
tolled
forever.
there
is
no
time
limitation.
there
is
no
rational
relationship
at
all
between
the
tolling
and
how
long
it
takes
to
find
a
defendant.
so
that
if
it
only
takes
a
year
they
can
wait
50
years,
as
we
said,
and
in
fact
even
if
they
know
where
the
defendant
is
because
of
this
anachronistic
interpretation
in
ohio,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
knowing
that
longarm
jurisdiction
will
not
give
a
company
the
protection
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
they
can
choose
to
wait.
even
though
they
have
the
address
and
they
know
where
they
are,
they
can
just
choose
to
wait.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
well,
it
could
very
possibly
be,
if
there
is
a
younger
plaintiff
possibly,
but
it
is
often
times
more
difficult
for
a
defendant
to
defend
if
there
is
not
someone
there
directly
on
point
that
can
testify
to
what
happened,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
burden
is
more
on
the
defendant
in
that
kind
of
suit
than
it
is
on
the
plaintiff
from
the
standpoint
of
trying
to
have
someone
there
who
is
physically,
you
know,
in
existence
at
that
time,
and
it
might
be
the
type
of
thing
almost
like
a
choice
of
forum,
where
depending
on
the
situation
there
might
be
in
particular
instances
particular
reasons.
it
might
be
that
the
foreman
on
the
job
is
an
older
person,
and
there
might
be
a
personal
injury
type
case
or
something,
and
they
are
hoping
that
the
person
might
not
be
around
if
they
wait
a
long
period
of
time.
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
i
disagree
that
it's
evenhanded.
i
think
that
it's
grossly
discriminatory,
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
only
interstate
corporations,
which
under
the
statute
are
compelled
in
order
to
obtain
this
benefit
to
appoint
a
statutory
agent
and
become
subject
to
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
state
of
ohio,--
mr.
ira
j.
bornstein
--but
it
would
not
require
them
to
become
subject
to
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
ohio
to
appoint
an
agent
in
order
to
do
that.
a
person...
this
is
part
of
the
distinction
between
the
fact
a
person
has
physical
presence.
a
corporation
is
a
legal
fiction.
it
doesn't
have
physical
presence.
it
does
business.
that's
why
most
states
except
for
ohio
state
that
if
you
are
subject
to
longarm
jurisdiction
you
get
the
benefit
of
a
statute
such
as
this.
interstate
corporations
are
unique
in
this
aspect,
because
of
the
fact
the
only
way
they
can
do
it
is
to
appoint
a
statutory
agent
and
therefore
become
subject
to
the
general
jurisdiction,
and
a
person,
an
ohio
resident
does
not
have
that
problem,
is
not
forced
into
that
dilemma
or
that
hobson's
choice.
as
far
as
the
letters
from
the
ohio
secretary
of
state
which
were
referenced
by
mr.
crowley,
quite
to
the
contrary,
as
far
as
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
could
have
just
been
some
type
of
designation
with
the
secretary
of
state,
the
letters
are
not
different.
the
bottom
line
of
both
letters
is
exactly
the
same,
and
that's
because
of
the
fact
the
second
letter,
the
december
letter,
patricia
mell
stated
that
in
the
general
course
of
business
the
ohio
secretary
of
state
would
not,
would
not
recognize
nor
accept
a
designation
of
agents
from
an
unlicensed
foreign
corporation,
which
also
indicates
as
far
as
the
previous
questions,
is
there
any
indication
that
a
corporation
can
somehow
otherwise
appoint
an
agent,
this
indicates,
no,
it
can't,
because
the
ohio
secretary
of
state
themselves
has
come
out
and
said
that
you
can't,
we
won't
recognize
it,
we
won't
even
allow
it
to
be
filed.
the
only
way
for
a
company
to
file
this
with
us
is
to
first
become
licensed,
and
the
previous
letter,
from
september
of
1983
came
right
out
and
stated
that
they
will
not
accept
for
filing
a
designation
of
statutory
agent
for
an
unlicensed
foreign
corporation,
and
therefore
there
really
is
not
any
distinction
between
the
letters
except
for
some
speculative
language
that
then
followed
in
that
letter
about
what
happened
if
there
might
be,
might
be
some
investigation.
there's
no
guidelines
for
the
investigation,
no
type
of
format
to
do
it,
what
the
parameters
of
it
were,
and
in
fact,
looking
at
the
bottom
line,
there
was
not
even
a
statement
that
if
somehow
they
would
comply
with
the
investigation
that
the
secretary
of
state
would
even
ever
allow
or
recognize
that
registration
or
that
designation.
and
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
looking
at
it
came
out
and
correctly
stated
that
the
argument
was
highly
speculative
and
devoid
of
any
statutory
support.
there
was
no
statutory
support
at
all.
even
that
of
the
letters
which
they
relied
upon
which
were
not
even
filed
in
this
case
but
instead
in
the
companion
case
of
copley
versus
heil-quaker.
as
far
as
the
question
of
retroactivity,
i
haven't
heard
any
real
valid
excuses
here
today
nor
have
i
at
any
point
in
time
as
to
why
this
wasn't
raised.
they
claim
that
they
know
that
they
could
have
raised
it
at
any
point
in
time.
as
we
have
stated
all
along,
retroactivity
is
not
a
new
or
unique
issue.
it
is
something
that
the
issue
has
been
around
for
years
and
years
and
years.
made
a
choice.
they
looked
at
it,
and
they
decided,
they
claimed,
based
upon
the
initial
coons
case,
that
they
couldn't
win,
and
therefore
they
chose
not
to
raise
it.
they
didn't
raise
it
in
the
district
court.
they
didn't
raise
it
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
they
only
raised
it
after
the
coons
court
in
a
rehearing
before
the
supreme
court
found
that
it
would
only
be
applied
prospectively.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that...
they
waived
it.
it
was
not
even
raised,
in
fact,
in
their
opening
brief
in
the
sixth
circuit.
it
was
only
in
their
reply
brief,
and
the
same
excuse
they
gave
then
is
the
same
one
they
gave
now,
which
is
simply
the
fact,
we
made
a
choice,
but
coons
ii
came
along
and
we
realized
now
that
we
might
have
another
argument.
coons
ii,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
i
believe,
is
a
poorly
rationalized
decision.
i
believe
that
under
the
cases
that
we've
cited
that
it
would
be
patently
unfair,
besides
the
fact
that
they've
waived
it,
to
deny
midwesco
the
fruit
of
its
labor.
i
believe
that
it
would
have
a
tremendous
impact
upon
the
legal
profession
if
one
could
not
obtain
the
benefits
of
their
own
work,
and
if
the
clients
could
not
do
that,
and
in
fact
i
haven't
seen
any
cases
cited
by
bendix
indicating,
except
the
coons
ii
case,
that
one
is
not
entitled
to
the
application
in
their
own
case
of
a
decision
of
unconstitutionality.
first
of
all,
it
would
render
the
decision
basically
moot,
which
this
court
has
held
it
can't
do
on
a
constitutional
issue,
and
more
importantly
is
the
fact
that
in
all
the
cases,
including
chevron,
which
they
are
so
fond
of
citing,
chevron
involved
the
application
of
the
holding
in
another
case,
in
the
rodrigue
versus
aetna
casualty,
and
interestingly
enough,
in
that
case,
in
rodrigue,
the
court
held
that
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
holding.
the
case
was
remanded
back
down,
and
there
are
no
cases
cited
where
a
party
is
not
entitled
to
the
fruits
of
its
work,
and
i
believe
it
would
be
inequitable,
to
say
the
least,
to
deny
midwesco
the
benefits,
and
the
benefits
which
i
believe
it
has
conferred
upon
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
as
well
as
interstate
corporations,
who
are
always
the
beneficiaries
of
constitutional
holdings.
i
believe
that
we
have
established
that
this
is
a
forced
licensure
provision,
and
that
it
is
the
conditions
which
this
court
has
to
look
at.
it
has
to
look
at
that
because
of
the
whole
theory
behind
the
commerce
clause,
the
theory
behind
the
fact
that
the
states
are
not
separate
economic
unit,
the
fact
that
you
cannot
stop
interstate
corporations
from
going
into
and
engaging
in
business
in
the
various
states
and
i
believe
for
that
reason
that
this
court
must
affirm
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
