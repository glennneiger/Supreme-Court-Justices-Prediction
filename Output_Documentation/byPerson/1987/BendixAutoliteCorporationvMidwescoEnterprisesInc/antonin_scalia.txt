justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
you.
do
you
concede
that
if
the
only
way
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
shorter
statute
of
limitations
were
to
become
licensed
for
all
purposes
in
ohio,
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
scalia
he
has
to
be
an
agent
for
service
in
all
matters,
not
just
in
the
particular
contract.
justice
scalia
that
would
do
it.
justice
scalia
that
is
something
of
a
burden,
to
have
a
general
corporation
resident
for...
what
you
are
saying
is,
you
have
to
agree
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
the...
or
not
to
be...
not
to
have
the
burden
of
the
tolling
statute
you
have
to
have
a
resident
there
for
all
purposes
and
be
sued
by
anybody
who
wants
to
sue
you
in
that
state.
that
is
something
of
a
burden.
justice
scalia
no,
but
those
are
the
only
cases
that
you
have
in
ohio
that
talk
about
a
general
agent
for
service,
right?
justice
scalia
mr.
crowley,
i
have
a
special
concern
about
whether
this
statute
is
discriminatory
in
the
sense
that
it
is
peculiarly
directed
against
out
of
state
companies
or
against
interstate
business.
is
it
or
isn't?
justice
scalia
you
could
be,
i
take
it,
a
domestic
company
in
that
state
or
could
have
been
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
tort
and
then
if
you
move
your
company
elsewhere
you
would
still
be
liable.
justice
scalia
the
tolling
statute
would
apply.
or
if
you
were
a
private
citizen,
never
mind
companies--
justice
scalia
--if
you
were
a
private
citizen
and
didn't
even
move
your
residence
but...
well,
i
guess
you
could
be
served
at
your
residence,
i
don't
know.
if
you
moved
out
of
the
state
and
came
back
it
would
be
tolled
while
you
were
gone.
justice
scalia
you
think
that's
the
only
way
that
the
ohio
statute
can
be
complied
with?
suppose
you
have
a
state
that
isn't
doing
business
in
the
state
but
it
does...
it
does
no
business
but
it
does
rent
an
office
there.
you
think
that
that
would
not
comply
with
the
statute
unless
they
actually
registered
with
the
secretary
of
state?
justice
scalia
sure,
so
that
would
comply.
justice
scalia
well,
the
next
step
is,
they
don't
have
an
office
there
but
they
have
an
agent
there
who
is
in
somebody
else's
office.
justice
scalia
among
the
questions
you
wish
he
had
answered
is
whether
he
would
accept
it.
all
he
said
is
that
he
could.
justice
scalia
i
think
that's
the
bottom
line,
that
he
could.
