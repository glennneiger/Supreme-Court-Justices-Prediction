o'connor
mr.
crowley--
justice
o'connor
--if
the
only
way
to
satisfy
the
requirement
of
ohio's
statute
is
for
the
foreign
company
to
come
in
and
actual
register
to
do
business
for
all
purposes,
do
you
concede
that
it
would
fail
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
you
didn't
hear
my
question
then
or
maybe
i
misstated
it.
justice
o'connor
if
the
only
way
of
complying
with
the
ohio
statute
is
to
register
for
all
purposes,
do
you
concede
that
the
commerce
clause
burden
would
be
such
that
the
statute
would
fail?
justice
o'connor
we
will
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
i
would
like
you
to
address
that
question
first,
and
i
just
wonder
what
authority
you
rely
on
for
thinking
that
that
would
not
be
so
burdensome
as
to
fail.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
was
my
question
exactly.
justice
o'connor
and
i
have
different
responses
from
you
now
to
justice
scalia
and
to
me
and
i
don't
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
o'connor
well,
here
the
consequence
is
simply
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
tolled.
justice
o'connor
you
think
that
is
different
somehow.
justice
o'connor
now,
the
courts
below
in
this
case
apparently
did
not
find
that
the
statute,
the
tolling
statute
would
be
met
by
a
provision
in
the
contract.
justice
o'connor
but
they
said
that
didn't
answer
the
question.
justice
o'connor
how
are
we
to
know
what
the
state
law
is
on
that
subject?
justice
o'connor
nothing
from
this
state
of
ohio?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion,
is
it?
i
mean,
there
is
a
sentence
in
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
says
that
we
acknowledge
that
midwesco
could
have
chosen
to
name
an
agent
as
part
of
its
contract
with
bendix.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
want
us
then
to
say
the
sixth
circuit
was
just
wrong
on
that
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
answer
to
the
question,
though,
seems
to
me
to
affect
the
extent
of
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
if
it
can
be
done
that
easily,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
less
of
a
burden.
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
o'connor
and
it
would
be
helpful
to
know.
justice
o'connor
so
are
we
stuck
just
as
we
were
in
the
searle
case
with
not
knowing
and
having
to
send
it
back?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
was
new
jersey,
not
ohio.
