unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
matter
with
that?
unknown
speaker
but
you
seem
to
acknowledge
that
they
can
appoint
an
agent
within
the
state
without
complying
with
the
whole
licensing
scheme
of
the
secretary
of
state.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
gave
it
away
when
you
said
you
could
have
an
office
there
without
doing
business
in
the
state
and
they
could
serve
you
with
that
office.
i
think
you
gave
it
away
then,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
can
have
physical
presence
by
an
office,
why
can't
you
have
physical
presence
by
somebody
that
you
name
as
an
agent?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
that?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
have
any
agents,
foreign
corporations
can't
have
any
agents
in
that
state
unless
they
are
appointed
under
that
provision?
i
can't
imagine
that.
there
are
a
lot
of--
unknown
speaker
--but
this
was
not
a
company
that
was
transacting
business.
precisely.
i
mean,
this
is
a
company
that
doesn't
want
to
transact
business.
it
just
wants
to
have
an
agent
there.
i
can't
believe
that
the
only
way
to
get
an
agent
in
the
state
of
ohio
is
to
use
that
provision.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bornstein,
it
is
essential
for
you
to
prevail
here,
isn't
it,
to
show
that
midwesco
was
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce
in
its
dealings
in
ohio.
unknown
speaker
and
what,
it
sold
and
installed
a
boiler
to
bendix,
where,
in
fostoria,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
that...
what
did
the
installation
efforts
consist
of?
unknown
speaker
shipping
it
in
or--
unknown
speaker
--and
wasn't
subject
to
qualification.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that...
would
this
case
come
out
differently
from
your
point
of
view
if
ohio
had
a
provision
that
allowed
a
foreign
corporation
to
appoint
an
agent
for
service
of
process
without
requiring
them
to
qualify?
unknown
speaker
anybody...
any
foreign
corporation
that
wants
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
our
state
may
file
a
piece
of
paper
appointing
an
agent
for
service
of
process,
and
he
can
appoint
the
secretary
of
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
office
that
justice
scalia
asked
you
about?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wouldn't
be
a
valid
service,
i
take
it.
just
having
an
office
there
doesn't
mean
that
the
service
would
be
valid.
it
would
just
mean
there
would
be
presence
and
you
could
get
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
subject
you
to
suit.
it
just
means
that
you
can
be
served
in
a
state.
you
haven't
got
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
well,
if
they
can
find
you
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
you
haven't
been
forced
to
do
that.
the
only
thing
that
requires
you
to
register
here
is,
you
want
the
benefit
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
don't
register.
unknown
speaker
if
nobody
can
sue,
if
nobody
can
get
service
on
you,
why,
you
are
not
really
at
much
risk.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
if
they
find
out
they
could
use
the
longarm
statute
against
you
you
couldn't
get
the
statute
of
limitations
either.
unknown
speaker
the
plaintiff
might
be
pretty
old,
too.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
practical
motive
that
might
impel
them
to
wait,
as
you
point
out?
unknown
speaker
but
what
usually
happens
is
just
the
opposite.
it
is
usually
the
defendant
who
is
hiding,
not
the
plaintiff
who
is
waiting
50
years.
it
is
usually
just
the
opposite.
and
this
is
a
statute
to
meet
that
problem.
now,
it
applies
evenhandedly,
and
we
can't
under
the
constitution
grant
an
exemption
to
the
citizens
of
ohio,
for
example,
if
a
citizen
of
ohio,
even
if
he
is
reachable
by
longarm,
but
he
takes
off,
and
he
is
not
there,
and
can't
be
served,
the
statute
will
be
tolled.
you
are
asking
us
to
give
special
benefits
to
interstate
companies,
even
though
citizens
in
ohio
can
be
subjected
to
this
dog
in
the
manger
process
of
somebody
waiting
50
years,
we
have
to
give
interstate
companies
an
exemption
from
it.
why
should
we
do
that?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
want
to
just
reverse
the
discrimination?
you
would
not
be
striking
down
this
statute
for
ohio
residents.
it
would
continue
to
apply
to
them,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
crowley.
the
case
is
submitted.
