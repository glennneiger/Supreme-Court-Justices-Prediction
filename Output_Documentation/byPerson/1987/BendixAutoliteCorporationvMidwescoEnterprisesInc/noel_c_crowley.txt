mr.
noel
c.
crowley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
appellant
in
this
lawsuit
is
bendix
autolite
corporation.
it
had
a
contract
with
the
appellee,
midwesco
enterprises,
under
which
midwesco
sold
and
installed
in
state
of
ohio
a
particular
boiler
which
turned
out
to
be
defective.
the
contract
was
fully
performed
in
the
state
of
ohio,
but
bendix
has
been
denied
the
right
to
maintain
an
action
in
the
state
of
ohio
because
the
applicable
four-year
statute
of
limitations
had
expired,
and
whether
the
action
is
maintainable
at
this
time
depends
on
the
constitutionality
under
the
commerce
clause
of
a
particular
ohio
tolling
statute
which
suspends
the
running
of
the
period
of
limitations
in
situations
as
we
have
here
where
the
defendant
can't
be
served
within
the
state
of
ohio.
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
have
held,
and
we
say
incorrectly,
that
the
ohio
tolling
statute
constitutes
an
impermissible
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
those
rulings
were
incorrect,
we
contend,
because
the
supposed
burden
on
commerce
is
so
slight
and
so
speculative
as
to
make
it
questionable
whether
the
burden
has
any
reality
at
all.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
precisely
so.
we
maintain
that
such
theoretical
burden
as
may
exist
is
purely
incidental
to
a
valid
state
purpose
and
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
resultant
benefits
which
have
been
achieved
for
the
benefit
of
ohio
citizens,
and
those
benefits,
as
i
will
explain
in
a
moment,
are
not
at
all
theoretical,
but
have
been
explicitly
recognized
as
valid
and
legitimate
objects
of
state
concern
by
this
court's
1982
decision
in
the
case
of
g.d.
searle
and
company
against
cohn,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
now,
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
ohio
tolling
statute
is
to
preserve
the
right
of
ohio
citizens
to
assert
claims
against
individuals
and
corporations
who
are
not
amenable
to
service
within
the
state
either
because
they
once
lived
there
and
later
moved
away
or
because
they
are
concealing
themselves
within
the
state,
or
because
they
never
lived
there
at
all.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no,
just--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--certainly
that
would
follow.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
the
statute
here
in
question
is
virtually
identical
to
a
particular
new
jersey
statute
which
this
court
reviewed
in
the
searle
case.
now,
we
are
accused
by
our
opponents
here
of
misreading
searle,
and
also
as
behaving
as
though
searle
fully
disposed
of
all
the
issues
and
compels
a
decision
in
our
favor.
that
is
not
our
position,
and
i
think
our
brief
acknowledges
that
it
is
not
the
case.
but
the
searle
case
does
conclusively
establish
that
a
statute
of
the
sort
we
are
talking
about
does
have
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
and
it
is
a
purpose
that
remains
valid
and
subsisting,
notwithstanding
the
adoption
by
the
state
of
ohio
of
an
alternative
method
of
addressing
the
same
concern,
and
that
is
the
process
for
longarm
service.
arrangements
for
in-state
service
continue
to
be
of
benefit,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
searle,
because
it
can't
always
be
guaranteed
that
a
particular
company,
a
particular
out
of
state
company
or
out
of
state
individual
can
actually
be
found.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no,
we
don't
at
all
concede.
we
welcome
the
chance
to
point
out
that
we
don't
suppose
that
to
be
the
situation
at
all
in
ohio,
that
that
isn't
by
any
means
the
only
way--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--forgive
me.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no,
and
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
and
it
is
a
little
hard
to
reckon
with
the
question
if
that
was
the
only
way
of
complying.
the
ohio
statute
doesn't
require
any
kind
of
behavior
at
all.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
what
it
is
not,
justice
o'connor,
what
it
is
not
is
a
forced
licensure
statute.
we
concede
that
if
it
were
a
forced
licensure
statute,
that
if
as
a
practical
matter
the
only
way
you
could
do
business
in
ohio
was
to
qualify
to
do
business,
we
would
concede
under
that
set
of
facts
that
it
would
fail,
but
there
is
a
great
disparity
between
what
we
are
talking
about
here
and
the
so-called
forced
licensure
statutes.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no,
we
do
not
so
concede.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no.
we
thought
if
it
could
fairly
be
said
of
the
statute
that
you
had
to
qualify
to
do
business,
that--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--in
order
to
seriously
expect
to
do
business
in
the
state,
as,
for
example,
in
the
allenberg
cotton
case,
where
there
is
a
familiar
kind
of
statute
arid
where
the
situation
is
such
that
you
are
under
that
statute
denied
access
to
the
courts
of
the
state
unless
and
until
you
qualify
to
do
business,
and
they
are
describing
business
which
is
of
an
interstate
character.
the
court
very
properly
said
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
very
properly
said
that
a
statute
of
that
sort
is
so
tantamount
to
a
direct
order
to
license--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--well,
i
had
difficulty
with--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--i
am
putting
it
badly,
but
i
understand
our
position
and
i
am
going
to
try
once
again
to
explain
it.
it
is,
if
you,
as
a
condition
of
doing
business
if
you
had
an
allenberg
cotton
type
of
situation,
properly
described
as
a
forced
licensure
situation,
and
if
the
consequence
of
not
being
qualified
to
do
business
was
that
you
can't
go
to
the
courts
of
that
state,
in
other
words,
you
can
sell
things,
but
if
the
people
don't
voluntarily
pay
you
you
have
no--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--yes,
exactly,
and
we
don't
think
that
that
is
sufficiently
coercive.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
it
most
assuredly
is
different.
it
is
not
sufficiently,
coercive
as
to
obligate
somebody
to
do
anything.
it
is
not
an
intolerable
situation
to
sell
things
and
to
be
subject
to
suit
and
to
have
to
defend
suit
on
the
merits
and
not
have
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
so,
again,
yes,
if
it
were
true
that
it
was
forced
licensure
it
would
be
invalid.
it
is
not,
even
if
it
was
the
only
means
of
compliance,
and
it
is
not,
an
invalid
statute
here
because
of
the
great
disparity
in
severity
of
sanctions
between
forced
licensure
and
this.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
we
are
puzzled
and
to
some
extent
confounded
by
what
the
reasoning
of
the
circuit
court
was
in
that
regard.
they
acknowledged
that
it
could
have
happened,
that
there
could
have
been
a
designation
of
an
agent
in
this
individual
contract
which
would
not
have--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--yes,
and
we
are
at
a
loss
to
know
just
what
they
meant
by
that.
if
they
meant
that
there
would
have
been
other
remaining
constitutional
questions
as
applied
to
other
people,
that
treatment
was
wrong
for
the
reason
we
say
it
is
wrong
in
our
brief,
that--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--i
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
which
even
refers
to
licensure,
so
all
that
can
be
said
of
licensure
is
that
it
is
one
means
of
appointing
an
agent
for
the
service
of
process.
we
certainly
have
an
ohio
state
law
and
we
have
cited
it
in
our
brief
that
says
the
means
by
which
you
serve
a
company
is
among
other
things
to
serve
an
agent.
you
serve
somebody
who
is
appointed
as
an
agent,
you
have
served
the
company.
so
i
take
it
it
follows
inexorably
from
that
that
any
time
you
have
somebody
designated
as
an
agent
who
is
resident
in
the
state
of
ohio
so
that
you
can
make
the
service
within
that
state,
you
have
provided
a
means
of
service
and
you
have
defeated
the
tolling
statute,
so
that
it
simply
doesn't
apply.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
suggest
that
that
would
be
the
case.
if
he
is
an
agent
for
the
particular
service
that
is
being
made--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--that
should
be
in
all
respects
sufficient.
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
statutes,
any
of
the
decisions
to
suggest
anything
to
the
contrary.
we
have
other
cases
from
other
jurisdictions,
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief,
saying
that
with
respect
to
the
federal
counterpart
of
the
ohio
statute,
saying
that
where
there
is
a
designation
by
contract
it
can
be
as
limited
as
the
parties
to
the
contract
want
to
make
it.
in
this
case
the
designation
not
only
could
have
been
limited
to
bendix,
it
could
have
been
limited
even
as
to
bendix
to
claims
arising
out
of
this
particular
contract.
and
that
would
have
been
a
full
and
sufficient
answer
to
the
attempt
to
apply
the
tolling
statute
in
this
case.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
it
is
a
particular
virginia
district
court
opinion,
and
it
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
yes.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no,
but
it
is
not
talking
about
a
particular
statute,
it
is
just
talking
about,
in
general
about
the
designation
of
agents.
certainly--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--forgive
me.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
i
think
there
are
ohio
decisions
that
confirm
that
if
a
corporation
has
an
agent
present
within
the
state,
that
that
makes
it
present
within
the
state
for
purposes
of
the
tolling
statute.
i
think
that
much
is
established,
and
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any
remaining
question
once
that
is
established
on,
of
course,
that
point.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
if
that
were
the
fact
that
would
be
a
substantial
burden.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
i
don't
understand
that
the
cases
we
have
in
mind
establish
whether
it
is
general
or
specific,
and
i
can't
imagine
any
reason
why
a
narrow
and
specific
appointment,
if
indeed
it
is
a
real
appointment,
should
be
any
the
less
efficacious
as
regards
the
particular
claim
to
which
it
is
addressed.
i
guess
if
i
don't
do
anything
else
today
i
should
like
to
differentiate
this
case
from
the
forced
licensure
kind
of
case.
in
forced
licensure,
where
you
tell
the
court...
correction,
tell
the
company
that
it
can't
use
the
courts
of
that
state
unless
it
qualifies
to
do
business
that
statute
has
no
purpose
other
than
to
induce
licensure.
it
doesn't
serve
any
interests
of
the
state
simply
to
deny
various
companies
access
to
the
courts.
it
only
makes
sense
as
an
inducement
to
make
them
do
something.
nothing--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--oh,
very
much
so.
yes,
if
the
company
is
become
localized
and
is
a
domesticated
company,
it
is
indistinguishable
from
any
other
company
resident
in
ohio,
and
i
take
it
for
that
reason
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
as
to
that,
and
it
would
be
perfectly
valid
to
deny
that
company
access
to
the
courts
unless
and
until
it
is
qualified
to
do
business.
but
reverting
to
the
other
point,
there
is
not
the
tiniest
suggestion
that
this
tolling
statute
here
in
question
is
intended
to
induce
any
kind
of
behavior
at
all
on
the
part
of
companies
or
individuals
or
anybody
else,
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
legislature
didn't
fully
achieve
its
purpose
simply
when
it
extended
the
limitation
period,
that
it
had
any
purpose
beyond
that
or
that
it
cared
at
all
about
whether
somebody
qualified
to
do
business
entered
into
business
or
not,
and
if
they
had
had
any
such
intent,
if
the
idea
had
been
to
compel
companies
to
take
out
a
license,
certainly
the
statute
would
have
been
poorly
suited
to
that
end,
and
there
isn't
the
tiniest
hint
or
suggestion
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
as...
that
it
has
had
that
practical
effect,
that
companies
that
might
not
have
been
of
a
mind
to
do
so
have
ever
felt
compelled
to
qualify
to
do
business,
and
it
simply
isn't
the
same
kind
of
restraint
that
we
are
talking
about.
we
have
read
the
recent
or
modern
commerce
clause
cases
by
this
court,
and
we
understand
that
some
of
them
go
further
than
some
scholarly
commentators
would
have
had
it
go,
or
than
some
members
of
the
court
itself
would
have
had
it
go,
but
at
least
with
those
cases,
all
of
them
involved
matters
that
had
the
potential,
at
least,
for
some
serious
economic
or
regulatory
dislocation.
if,
for
example,
you
try
to
regulate
the
width
of
a
truck
or
the
length
of
a
truck,
as
was
done
in
the
raymond
motor
case,
or
the
south
carolina
against
barnwell
brochers
case,
that
is
a
serious
restraint.
we
have
no
trouble
understanding
that
that
is
something
to
talk
about
there
when
the
conversation
turns
to
burden
on
commerce.
telling
an
arizona
grower
that
he
has
to
stop
bulk
shipping
his
cantaloupe
into
nearby
california
and
instead
has
to
construct
his
own
packing
facility
so
that
the
state
of
arizona
can
enjoy
the
good
will
associated
with
his
cantaloupes
by
having
them
labeled
as
arizona
cantaloupes
that
is
a
serious
burden.
we
don't
fail
to
understand
that.
telling
a
new
jersey
land
fill
operator
that
he
can't
accept
refuse
that
is
generated
outside
the
state
of
new
jersey.
that,
you
don't
have
to
examine
that
with
a
microscope.
discouraging
out
of
state
banks
and
out
of
state
insurance
companies
from
setting
up
shop
within
a
particular
state,
that
is
a
real
burden.
but
in
contrast
to
what
is
going
on
here,
the
restraint
here,
and
we
are
indebted
to
chief
justice
rehnquist
for
his
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
the
case
of
coons
against
american
honda
corporation,
and
we
want
to
incorporate
by
reference
everything
he
said
about
the
supposed
restraining
effect
of
the
new
jersey
statute
there
in
question,
and
his
wording
describing
that
burden
was,
it
is
slight.
we
would
say
that
certainly
it
is
slight--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--it
occurs
to
us,
it
occurs
to
us
that
this
case
may
be
a
fitting
occasion
for
the
court
saying
that
there
is
a
burden
that
is
so
slight,
so
speculative,
so
insubstantial
that
it
shouldn't
ever
be
subjected
to
hostile
scrutiny
either
under
the
so-called
per
se
test
or
the
balancing
test,
and
this
would
be
an
occasion
for
that,
but
to
reach
the
result
we
want
we
certainly
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
and
certainly
don't
have
to
reverse
allenberg
cotton.
we
accept
that
rule
as
a
rule
of
forced
licensure,
and
our
quarrel
with
the
courts
below
is
that
they
simply
made
the
automatic
association,
because
we
are
talking
here,
we
are
using
some
of
the
same
concepts.
we
are
talking
about
appointments
of
agents
for
service.
we
are
talking
about
qualifying
to
do
business.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
every
lower
court
that
has
considered
this
matter
either
in
this
case
or
in
the
case
of
coons
against
american
honda
has
made
the
automatic
association
that,
oh,
this
is
one
of
those
forced
licensure
cases,
and
without
any
analysis
at
all,
any
examination
of
what
truly
is
happening
under
this
ohio
statute,
have
lept
to
the
conclusion
that
on
the
authority
of
allenberg
cotton
and
the
dahnke-walker
case
and
the
other
famous
licensure
cases,
that
this
is
simply
another
illustration
of
that
same
principle.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
it
most
assuredly
is
not.

absolutely.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
absolutely.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
i
take
it
that
it
would,
and
the
case
seemed...
the
ohio
cases
seemed
to
indicate
that
where
there
is
a
sojourn
of
substantial
length
out
of
the
state,
that
the
tolling
does
apply.
if
it
is
a
vacation
trip,
that
seems
not
to
count.
but
all
of
that
is...
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
way
to
avoid
the
detriment
of
the
tolling
statute
is
to
qualify
to
do
business.
we
suppose
that
that
is
a
matter
of
greater
interest
to
the
court,
and
so
we
put
that
first.
the
patent
reality
is
that
no
such
circumstance
has
been
shown
to
be
the
case.
no
impediment
whatever
to
putting
it
in
the
contract,
putting
the
appointment...
and
putting
it
in
a
very
limited
fashion.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
i
don't
understand
that
any
such
negotiations
would
be
necessary
at
all.
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
in
the
contract,
i
have
an
agent,
he
is
in
columbus.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
i
think
we
have
sort
of
anticipated
that
question,
first
of
all,
that
that
would
be
a
puzzling
response
for
the
other
company
to
make,
because
presumably
they
benefit
from
having
an
in-state
agent
on
whom
they
can
effect
the
service,
so
it
would
be
puzzling
to
see
them
resist
it,
but
if
they
did,
arbitrarily
or
whatever,
the
other
company
simply
writes
them
a
letter
unilaterally
designating,
saying,
if
you
have
any
quarrel
with
this
contract,
any
claim,
we
have
appointed
somebody
our
agent,
he
is
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
and
here
is
where
you
can
find
him.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
i
think
that
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
whole
of
it.
we
see
in
the
record
and
we
concede
it
is
a
somewhat
unsatisfactory
record
of
exchanges
with
the
ohio
secretary
of
state's
office.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
this--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--well,
that
is
a
distinguishable
case,
not
the
case
presented
here,
but
we
are
indebted
to
judge
potter
in
the
district
court
in
toledo
for
making
the
suggestion
in
oral
argument
that
it
might
be
perfectly
feasible
for
a
company
to
designate
an
agent
on
the
product
itself,
and
that
is
not
an
issue
we
are
raising
here--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--that
is
the...
what
i
was
starting
to
explore,
talking
about
the
correspondence
that
is
in
the
record
that
was
exchanged
with
the
ohio
secretary
of
state's
office,
and
there
are
two
letters.
the
letters
are
really
contradictory.
the
first
letter
says,
we
would
not
accept
for
filing
any
such
designation
apart
from
the
licensure
process,
in
effect.
i
am
paraphrasing.
the
second
letter
said
we
would
accept
such
a
letter.
we
didn't
mean
to
say
what
we
apparently
said
in
the
earlier
letter,
and
we
would
in
fact
accept
something
if
we
were
satisfied
after
an
appropriate
investigation
that
it
was
not
intended
to
circumvent
our
licensing
procedure.
that
is
to
say,
if
it
was
done
by
somebody
wholly
in
interstate
commerce--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--the
answer
to
the
question,
put
in
those
terms,
is,
assuredly
not.
it
doesn't
have
to
stand
or
fall
in
one
case,
and
this
being
the
kind
of
case
it
is,
its
validity,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
should
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
the
operative
considerations
as
we
find
it.
i
would
also,
on--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--forgive
me,
justice--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--yes,
and
that
argument
is
made.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
there
could
have
been.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
and
if
there
is
a
remaining
burden,
it
is
because
they
didn't
make
the
designations,
not
because
of
any
infirmity
in
the
statute,
is
our
answer.
we
would
also
point
out
that
this
matter
of
trying
to
isolate
the
burden
becomes
even
more
illusory
when
you
consider
is
there
even
a
single
claim.
first
of
all,
i
will
digress
and
say
there
is
not
a
single
transaction
that
is
shown
in
the
record
here
to
have
ever
been
discouraged,
much
less
a
company
been
discouraged
from
doing
business
by
reason
of
anything
we
are
talking
about
here,
but
on
the
question
of
what
burden
there
is,
how
can
you
tell
that
a
particular
claim,
if
it
was
brought
in
the
period
as
extended
by
the
tolling
statute
would
not
have
been
brought
sooner
if
there
had
been
no
tolling
statute,
if
there
didn't
need
to
be,
and
in
this
regard
i
am
reminded
of
my
earliest
apprenticeship
in
the
practice
of
law,
where
it
was
explained
to
me,
facetiously,
i
am
sure,
that
the
operative
principle
in
the
scheduling
of
work
activities
is,
don't
put
off
until
tomorrow
what
you
can
put
off
indefinitely.
so
who's
to
say
that
what
didn't
have
to
be
done
today
by
reason
of--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--i
hope
i
didn't
pay
attention
to
the
lesson
and
don't
observe
it.
but
certainly
if
you
are
given
to
understand
you
have
a
specified
length
of
time
to
do
something
you
can
be
excused
for
taking
that
seriously
and
acting
in
conformity
to
it.
that
brings
me
finally
to
the
question
of
retroactive
application.
we
concede
we
could
have
brought
up
the
issue
of
retroactive
application
from
the
earliest
time.
there
was
never
any
impediment.
we
were
discouraged
from
doing
so
because
of
the
treatment
the
retroactivity
issue
got
in
the
coons
case,
where
the
state
of
new
jersey
deliberated
about
that,
examined
the
issue
of
retroactivity
and
said
they
weren't
going
to...
they
were
not
going
to
make
it
prospective
only.
well,
it
was
on
that
set
of
facts
that
it
looked
like
an
argument
to
which
the
courts
were
inhospitable,
and
we
didn't
make
the
point.
then,
after
we
had
written
our
brief
in
chief
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
new
jersey
court
reversed
itself
and
said,
it
is
a
case
that
should
only
be
applied
prospectively
and
not
retroactively,
and
at
that
point
with
that
enhanced
value
of
the
argument,
we
made
it,
made
it
only
in
our
reply
brief.
the
sixth
circuit
declined
to
deal
with
it
on
the
merits
because
it
came
only
in
the
reply
brief.
we
think
it
should
have
been
understandable
the
way
it
arose,
and
it
either
is
or
it
isn't,
and
that
is...
we
don't
think
it
should
be
necessary
to
reach
that
point,
our
main
point
being
that
there
is
no...
no
under
analysis,
an
analysis
that
has
never
been
made
in
any
of
the
lower
courts,
under
analysis
any
real
burden
on
commerce,
and
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
thank
you.
in
describing
the
unthinkability
of
open-ended
liabilities
that
last
in
perpetuity,
let's
not
forget
the
defense
of
laches,
and
in
that
regard
we
acknowledge
that
midwesco
cites
certain
cases
to
the
effect
that
the
doctrine
doesn't
apply
or
doesn't
apply
in
its
normal
way
in
the
state
of
ohio.
he
cites
cases,
and
we
will
concede
that
the
cases
are
supportive
of
what
he
says.
he
is
just
as
clear
that
the
cases
are
demonstrably
wrong.
the
true
state
of
law
in
the
state
of
ohio
is
in
the
cases
we
site
on
page
20
of
our
brief,
and
they
are
more
recent
cases.
they
are
more
authoritative
because
they
come
from
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
and
they
make
it
clear
that
the
doctrine
of
laches
does
obtain.
even
if
it
were
open
ended
and
permanent,
if
the
company
is
engaged
entirely
in
interstate
commerce,
has
no
minimal
contacts
with
the
state,
why
should
that
be
unsatisfactory
to
them?
they
are
never
going
to
be
vulnerable
to
suit
anywhere
in
the
state
of
ohio.
there
is
nothing
parochial
about
this
state.
there
is
nothing
protectionist
about
it.
it
provides
for
evenhanded
treatment.
what
if
it
be
the
fact
that
there
is
no
statute
in
ohio
that
provides
for
an
alternative
method
of
service?
shouldn't
it
be
just
as
relevant
that
if
under
the
practice,
as
the
secretary
of
state
in
ohio
says
is
the
case,
there
are
circumstances
under
which
they
would
take,
and
the
whole
message
is
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
the
relevant
message
from
that
office,
what
does
it
matter
that
there
may
not
be
a
statute
if
it
is
the
practice
of
the
state
of
ohio
to
accept
designations
of
agency
apart
from
the
licensure
process?
that
letter
does
not--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--not
necessarily.
the
letter
doesn't...
there
are
lots
of
questions
one
could
think
of
that
we
wish
were
answered
by
the
letter.
our
only--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--nothing
in
the
letter
to
suggest
that
it
couldn't
be
a
limited
designation,
couldn't
identify
the
class
or
category
of
claims
and
of
people
in
whose
favor
it
might
operate.
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
no,
he
said...
i
understand--
mr.
noel
c.
crowley
--i
understand
that
they
said
on
page
28,
on
our
page
28
that
there
is
a
situation
in
which
they
would
do
it.
this
office...
well,
this
office
could
accept
without
requiring
the
corporation
to
obtain
a
license.
that
implies
to
me
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
they
would
do
it.
we
wish
we
knew
more
about
the
circumstances.
it
should
have
been
enough
to
withstand
summary
judgment
and
it
wasn't.
