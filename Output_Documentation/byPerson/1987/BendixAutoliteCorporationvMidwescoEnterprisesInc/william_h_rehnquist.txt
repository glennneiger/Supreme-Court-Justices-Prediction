chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bendix
autolite
coproration
versus
midwesco
enterprises,
inc.--
mr.
crowley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
the
ohio
tolling
statute
should
have
been
allowed
to
be
applied
by
the
ohio
courts
and
therefore
it
would
not
have
run
against
you
in
your
action
against
midwesco?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
one
proviso
of
the
allenberg
holding
that
the
company
has
to
be
engaged
only
in
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
crowley.
mr.
bornstein,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
bornstein,
in
that
passage
from
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
they
say
two
arguments
are
made.
one
is
appointing
an
agent,
and
the
other
is
giving
notice
to
the
secretary
of
state.
then
they
say
they
could
have
appointed
an
agent,
so
that
is
something
we
have
to
deal
with.
they
say
as
to
the
suggestion
giving
notice
to
the
secretary
of
state
it
is
highly
speculating
and
devoid
of
any
statutory
support.
now,
that
suggests
to
me
by
implication
that
they
thought
probably
the
first
thing,
appointing
an
agent
for
the
contract,
did
have
some
statutory
support.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they
certainly
didn't
use
your
argument
in
dealing
with
the
question
at
all,
did
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bornstein.
mr.
crowely,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-367,
bendix
autolite
corporation
against
midwesco
enterprises,
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
