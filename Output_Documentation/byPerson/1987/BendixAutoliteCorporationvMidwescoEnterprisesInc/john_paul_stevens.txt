justice
stevens
tell
me,
what
is
the
case
that
holds
that
would
have
been
a
sufficient
answer?
justice
stevens
a
virginia
case?
justice
stevens
the
ohio
statute
hasn't
been
construed
on
this
point,
though,
has
it?
justice
stevens
the
ohio
statute
has
not
been
construed
on
this
point.
there
are
no
ohio
authorities
supporting
your
position?
justice
stevens
do
you
also
rely
on
his
dissent
in
the
allenberg
cotton
case?
justice
stevens
you
don't.
justice
stevens
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
burden
in
the
problem
of
having
to
negotiate
the
appropriate
period
of
limitations
in
a
contract?
most
people
don't
have
to
negotiate
this
sort
of
provision.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
supposing
the
ohio
company
said,
we
want
the
benefit
of
the
existing
statute.
we
are
not
going
to
give
up
that
right.
what
are
you
going
to
give
us
for
that?
justice
stevens
and
how
long
will
he
be
there?
justice
stevens
the
operative
considerations
are
those
where
there
is
no
agent
been
appointed,
right?
justice
stevens
one
of
the
operative
considerations
that
we
find
is,
there
was
no
agent
appointed
in
ohio.
justice
stevens
if
you
represent
plaintiffs,
i
don't
imagine
you
explained
that
operative
principle
to
them,
that
we
are
not
going
to
get
to
your
work
any
sooner
than
we
have
to.
