justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ohio
has
a
statute
of
limitations
which
requires
that
contract
actions
be
commenced
within
a
four-year
period.
when
midwesco
was
sued
in
ohio
by
bendix,
it
invoked
the
statute
or
it's
all
agreed
the
suit
was
filed
six
years
after
the
contract
breach.
bendix,
however,
pointed
to
a
further
provision
of
ohio
law
which
provides
that
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
begin
to
run
if
the
defendant
is
not
present
in
ohio.
midwesco
is
an
illinois
company
and
it
was
present
in
ohio
only
while
it
did
the
single
project
for
bendix
six
years
earlier,
the
project
which
is
the
subject
of
this
suit.
the
only
way
for
midwesco
to
have
had
the
protection
of
the
limitation
statute
would
have
been
for
it
to
appoint
an
agent
for
service
of
process
in
ohio.
that
in
turn
would
have
subjected
midwesco
to
suit
by
anyone
for
any
transaction
at
all.
united
states
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
both
agreed
with
midwesco
that
this
restriction
on
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
is
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
too
agree
with
that
position
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
although
statute
of
limitations
defenses
are
not
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
obvious
that
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
legal
system
and
i
relied
upon
it
to
project
the
liabilities
of
persons
and
corporations
active
in
the
commercial
sphere.
the
state
may
not
withdraw
such
defenses
on
conditions
repugnant
to
the
commerce
clause.
the
burden
on
commerce
here
is
excessive
in
relation
to
any
interest
of
the
state.
the
ohio
statute
restricting
the
limitations
defense
may
therefore
not
be
invoked
to
bar
this
suit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
