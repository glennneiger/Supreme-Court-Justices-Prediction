justice
blackmun
mr.
hembree,
the
tax
years
involved
here
are
some
time
ago,
a
decade
or
so.
has
the
kentucky
usury
law
been
changed
in
the
meantime?
justice
blackmun
so
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
this
in
order
to,
as
you
put
it,
to
comply
with
the
kentucky
usury
law,
rather
than
to
avoid
it.
justice
blackmun
today
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
it.
justice
blackmun
all
right.
