justice
white
sounds
just
like
an
agency,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well,
i
interrupted
you
again,
and
i'm
sorry.
justice
white
--but
you'd
be
satisfied,
i
take
it,
if
one
of
these
partners
had
a
father
who
owned
a
title
company
and
they
just
went
over
to
the
title
company
and
said,
would
you
please
hold
the
title
to
this
property
for
us,
and
the
company
said,
sure.
and
we
won't
charge
you
anything
either.
you'd
be
all
right?
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
charge
this
one.
justice
white
it's
not
an
agency?
so
you
mean,
it
won't
be
enough
for
you
even
if
it's
an
independent
corporation
not
controlled
at
all?
justice
white
well,
it's
an
independent
corporation.
it's
owned
by
the
man's
father,
but
the
man's
father's
not
part
of
the
partnership.
he's
just
a
good
guy,
a
good
dad.
justice
white
so
if
they
went
through
these
same
motions
they
went
through
here
with
this
title
company
that
i
talked
about,
it
would
be
all
right.
justice
white
and
the
only
problem
is
the
controlled
corporation,
is
that
it?
justice
white
would
you
be
in
great
trouble
if
you
went
into
court
in
this
tax
case
in
kentucky
and
said
this
corporation
that
was
set
up
to
hold
title
is
just
the
alter
ego
for
the
partnership?
justice
white
would
you
be
in
any
trouble
under
kentucky
usury
laws?
justice
white
so
kentucky
wouldn't
mind.
they're
willing
to
go
just
on
the
record.
justice
white
so
everybody
knows
the
way
around
the
usury
law
in
kentucky.
justice
white
how
do
you
distinguish
moline?
justice
white
yes,
but
the
board
got
reversed.
justice
white
and
of
course,
the
government
in
that
case
was
on
your
side.
justice
white
i
think
the
government's
position
didn't
stand
up
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
i
know,
but
not
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
oh,
yeah,
all
right,
go
ahead.
justice
white
of
course,
that
solves
the
whole
case.
the
government
says
that
the
income
was
the
corporation's.
justice
white
--took
the
contrary
position
there.
justice
white
well,
the
tax
court
got
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
and
the
tax
court
agreed
with
the
government's
position
because
the
government
there
was
trying
to
stick
the
taxpayer,
the
individual,
trying
to
ignore
the--
justice
white
--you
may
be,
you
may
be.
