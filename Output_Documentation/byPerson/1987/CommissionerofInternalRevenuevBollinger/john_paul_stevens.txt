justice

mr.
horowitz,
the
partnership
didn't
own
the
stock
in
this
corporation,
did
it?
wasn't
one
of
the
individual
partners
the
owner?
justice
stevens
in
the
other
cases,
in
one
more,
i
don't
remember
the
number,
there
are
five
or
six
cases,
one
of
the
cases
the
sole
shareholder
is
the
beneficial
owner,
and
in
the
other
case,
some
of
the
other
cases,
there's
a
partnership
that
is
treating
it
as
income
and
the
partnership
didn't
own
the
corporation,
just
one
of
the
partners.
justice
stevens
well,
factually,
am
i
correct?
justice
stevens
well,
the
argument's
whether
they
were
corporate
expenses,
or
the
corporation
was
an
agent,
and
therefore
they're
the
principals'
expenses.
that's
the
issue.
justice
stevens
and
they
paid
the
expenses
of
a
corporate
entity
that
they
did
not
own.
justice
stevens
and
also
that
it
was
personally
guaranteed
by
the
partners
in
one
case,
and
by
the
individual
shareholder
in
the
other,
is
that
not
true?
justice
stevens
so
they
were
personally
liable
for
the
debt?
justice
stevens
and
they
made
the
regular
payments,
and
they
were
looked
to
as
the
principal
obligors,
even
though
they
were
even
though
the
were
in
the
form
of--
justice
stevens
--was
there
a
guarantee
in
the
moline
properties
case?
i
can't
tell
from
the
opinion.
justice
stevens
do
you
know
from
the
opinion
whether
the
individual,
after
the
assumption
by
the
corporation,
remained
liable
on
the
note
in
the
moline
case?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
ultimate
security
was
the
property
whereas
here,
the
ultimate
security
well--
justice
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
i
interrupted
you
and
i
apologize,
but
i
didn't
give
you
a
chance
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
stevens
which
was
what
more
should
the
taxpayer
have
done
in
order
to
make
it
a
true
agency
relationship
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
now,
there's
another
choice,
they
could
use
an
employee,
they
could
use
the
secretary
in
the
office
as
the
nominee
and
give
her
all
the
protections,
all
the
guarantees,
agree
to
insure
the
property
and
all
the
rest.
would
she
be
an
agent
or
not?
justice
stevens
but
assume
you
had
a
situation
for
a
different
reason
other
than
usury
that
you
felt
it
necessary
to
use
the
nominee.
you'd
say
that...
i
don't
know
why
that
would
be
any
different
that
you'd
then
have
an
individual
who'd
have
to
report
the
income
and
so
on.
justice
stevens
you
might
have
different
brackets.
maybe
you
don't
anymore,
but
depending
on
who
got
the
income
first.
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
there's
any
tax
avoidance
motive
here
do
you?
justice
stevens
what's
wrong
with
the
motive
that
it
may
be
a
little
cheaper
to
form
a
corporation
than
to
ask
some
national
corporation
to
use
one
of
their
subsidiaries
or
something
like
that?
isn't
that
a
legitimate
business
justification
for
doing
it?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
if
all
of
the
legal
incidents
of
the
relationship
are
identical,
whether
there's
compensation
or
not,
why
is
one
an
agency
and
the
other
not?
i
just
don't
understand.
if
all
of
the
controls
and
all
of
the
potential
liability
and
risks
of
the
profit
and
loss
and
everything
else
are
the
same,
i
don't
understand
why
the
fact
you
may
pay
somebody
like
corporation
trust
company
$100
a
year
for
performing
this
service
should
change
the
relationship?
justice
stevens
but
the
case
might
be
different
if
the
law
firm
that
represented
these
people
formed
a
corporation
and
the
partners
in
the
law
firm
just
served
as
stockholders
and
so
forth,
and
then
used
this
corporation
for
this
purpose.
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
stevens
you'd
have
exactly
the
same
control.
justice
stevens
no,
they'd
get
reimbursed
by
their
clients.
they're
not
going
to
do
this
as
a
matter
of
generosity
just
they'd
be
sure
that
all
expenses
are
paid
by
the
people
who
have
an
interest
in
having
the
business
go
forward.
justice
stevens
mr.
hembree,
maybe
they
were
agents
of
the
corporation.
maybe
they
were
agents
of
the
corporation,
i
say.
justice
stevens
well,
do
you
mean
to
say
that,
suppose,
as
your
opponent
suggests,
that
somebody
slipped
on
the
ice
in
front
of
the
building
and
brought
suit,
and
they
searched
the
title
records,
and
found...
i
suppose
the
record
title
showed
in
the
corporate
entity?
justice
stevens
i
suppose
if
they
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
corporate
entity
and
then
the
statute
of
limitations
ran
before
the
found
out
who
the
real
true
owner
was,
you'd
say
they
couldn't
recover
because
they
sued
the
wrong
party?
justice
stevens
if
they
didn't
name
the
other
people
as
defendants,
just
got
a
judgment
against
the
corporate
entity,
you
don't
think
they
could
recover
on
that
judgment
and
foreclose
against
the
real
estate,
if
they
had
to.
justice
stevens
they're
indemnified
but
would
it
not
be
true
that
a
judgment
would
be
a
lien
against
the
real
estate,
if
it
was
just
against
the
corporation?
justice
stevens
so
you
can't
totally
ignore
the
corporation.
justice
stevens
counsel,
isn't
that
your
distinction
with
the
moline
case,
not
the
fact
that
they
called
in
the
income
coming
from
one
or
the
other,
in
that
case,
there
was
no
agency
agreement,
whereas
there
was
in
this
case.
isn't
that
true?
justice
stevens
i
thought
the
argument
in
that
case
was
that
they
should
be
treated
as
an
agency
simply
because
they
were
wholly
owned
by
the
individual,
and
that
was
not
enough
to
establish
agency.
and
here
you
say
a),
you're
not
wholly
owned,
and
b)
we've
got
a
separate
nominee
agreement.
justice
stevens
and
in
other
words,
the
mere
fact
that
i
own
all
the
stock
is
not
enough
to
make
me
the
principal
in
the
corporation
an
agent.
basically,
that's
what--
