mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
two-tiered
structure
established
by
congress
to
govern
the
tax
treatment
of
a
corporation
and
its
shareholders.
to
briefly
summarize
that
structure,
it
treats
a
corporation
as
a
separate
taxable
entity
that
must
recognize
on
its
own
return
the
tax
consequences
of
its
business
activities.
the
shareholders'
individual
taxes
are
affected
by
this
business
activity
only
indirectly,
that
is,
in
connection
with
their
own
dealings
with
the
corporate
entity.
corporate
income
is
recognized
by
the
corporation.
the
shareholders
pay
tax
on
corporate
income
only
when
they
receive
a
distribution
of
corporate
earnings,
either
as
dividends
or
liquidating
distributions.
similarly,
when
a
corporation
suffers
net
operating
losses
in
a
given
year,
that
loss
is
deductible
by
the
corporation
on
its
own
return
and
may
be
carried
back
to
earlier
years
or
carried
forward
for
up
to
15
years
to
be
offset
against
corporate
income
in
future
years.
such
a
loss
would
be
reflected
on
the
shareholders'
return,
only
if
they
dispose
of
their
interest
in
the
corporation
or
liquidate
it.
back
in
the
1940s,
this
court
in
the
moline
case,
considered
the
question
whether
this
two-tiered
tax
structure
applied
in
full
to
so-called
dummy
corporations.
that
is,
situations
where
a
closely-held
corporation's
interest
are
essentially
congruent
with
those
of
its
shareholders
or
perhaps
in
many
cases
a
sole
shareholder,
and
where
the
business
activity
of
the
corporation
is
quite
limited.
the
facts
of
the
moline
case
are
in
many
respects
quite
similar
to
those
of
the
instant
case.
in
moline,
the
court
held
that
the
separate
entity
doctrine
was
fully
applicable
to
the
facts
there.
in
that
case,
the
mortgagee
had
required
an
individual
borrower
to
set
up
a
corporation
to
hold
title
to
mortgaged
property.
the
corporation
engaged
in
little
other
business
activity,
and
its
expenses
were
paid
directly
by
the
individual
shareholder.
despite
this
limited
activity
and
the
undisputed
fact
that
the
individual
was
the
beneficial
owner
of
the
property,
the
court
held
that
the
corporation
had
to
pay
tax
on
the
gain
when
the
property
was
sold.
the
court
summarized
its
holding,
as
follows,
and
i
quote:
"whether
the
purpose
be
to
gain
an
advantage
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
incorporation
or
to
avoid
or
to
comply
with
the
demands
of
creditors
or
to
serve
the
creator's
personal
or
undisclosed
convenience,
so
long
as
that
purpose
is
the
equivalent
of
business
activity
or
is
followed
by
the
carrying
on
of
business
by
the
corporation,
the
corporation
remains
a
separate
taxable
entity.
"
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
once
the
taxpayer
had
chosen
the
corporate
form
for
his
own
business
purposes,
he
was
bound
by
the
tax
consequences
of
this
choice.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
the
corporation
was
the
owner
of
the
property
and
the
fact
that
it
really
didn't
do
anything
other
than
operate
for
the
individual
shareholder
didn't
mean
that
that
could
just
be
transferred
to
the
individual
shareholder.
when
the
property
was
sold,
the
gain
had
to
be
recognized
by
the
corporation
and
a
corporate
tax
paid
on
the
gain.
now,
this
principle
of
moline
was
reaffirmed
several
years
later
by
the
court
in
the
national
carbide
case,
and
it's
now
a
well-settled
proposition,
and
indeed,
a
proposition
that
respondents
do
not
directly
challenge,
although,
as
i'll
explain
later,
we
think
the
thrust
of
their
argument
here
would
seriously
undermine
the
moline
principle.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
rule
of
moline.
respondents
in
this
case
chose
the
corporate
form
for
their
own
business
purposes,
and
now
they
seek
to
avoid
the
tax
consequences
of
that
choice.
in
short,
they
want
to
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
we
do.
we
do
recognize
that
exception.
there's
no
question
that
two
parties
can
deal
with
one
another
as
an
agent
and
a
principal,
in
which
case,
the
actions
of
the
agent
are
imputed
to
the
principal
and
the
principal
would
take
the
tax
consequences
of
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
you
mean
the
so-called
six
factors
that
are
set
out
in
national
carbide?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
those.
we
obviously
quarrel
with
respondents
over
what
the
proper
interpretation
of
those
factors
are.
we
do
think
that
that,
in
the
case
of
a
controlled
corporation,
that
was
intended
to
be
a
fairly
narrow
exception
by
the
national
carbide
court,
which
i
hope
to
explain
in
more
detail
a
little
bit
later.
but
we
don't
back
away
from
national
carbide.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
this
case?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
the
corporation
reported
any
income
in
this
case.
all
the
income
that
came
in
and
all
the
expenses
that
were
expended
in
constructing
the
apartment
complex
and
the
interest
paid
on
the
loan
was
all
reported
on
the
partners'
individual
returns.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
now,
basically
the
partners
treated
the
corporation
as
a
non-existent
shell.
now,
they
say
in
their
brief
that
they
concede
that
under
moline
it
was
a
separate
taxable
entity,
and
all
they
are
quibbling
about
is
were
the
particular
transactions
involved
with
these
apartment
complexes
should
be
attributed
directly
to
the
partners,
or
not.
but
the
fact
is
is
that
that's
all
there
was
in
the
corporation,
that's
all
that
was
going
on.
there
was
no
other
income
or
any
other
business
activity.
so
essentially,
they're
saying
that
the
corporations
have
to
be
disregarded.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
true
agent
relationship?
well,
we
think
where
there's
a
controlled
corporation
situation,
we
think
there
is
a
pretty
heavy
burden
to
be
borne
by
the
taxpayer
in
showing
that
there's
actually
a
true
agency.
the
problem
that
requires
this
heavy
burden,
and
we
think
this
was
set
forth
in
the
national
carbide
case,
is
that
the
relations
between
a
principal
and
his
agent
and
the
kind
of
control
that
a
principal
exerts
over
his
agent
is
quite
similar
to
the
kind
of
control
that
a
sole
shareholder
would
exert
over
a
closely
held
corporation,
just
in
the
exercise
of
the
normal
shareholder-corporation
relationship.
so
it's
kind
of
an
easy
expedient
for
avoiding
the
moline
rule
to
say,
well,
we've
got
this
corporation,
we
set
it
up,
we're
controlling
it,
but
we're
not
controlling
it
as
shareholders,
we're
controlling
it
as
agents,
and
we're
going
to
write
up
a
little
agreement
and
call
it
an
agency
agreement.
that's
what
the
taxpayer
tried
to
do
in
national
carbide
and
the
court
rejected
that.
now,
if
you
use
an
unrelated
agent,
then
the
situation
is
a
lot
clearer
because
there
is
no
other
basis
for
the
control
that
the
principal
is
exerting
over
the
agent,
so
it's
easy
enough
for
the
court
or
for
the
service
to
credit
the
agency
agreement.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
what
happened
was
the
corporation
went
out
and
it
got
a
loan
from
the
bank
in
its
own
name,
didn't
purport
to
be
acting
as
an
agent
or
anything
like
that,
and
then
it
took
the
loan
proceeds
and
deposited
them
into
an
account
that
was
called
a
construction
account.
and
that
was
not
denominated
as
a
corporate
account,
it
was
denominated
as
an
individual
account.
and
then
all
the
transactions
sort
of
flowed
out
of
that
account.
income
from
the
apartments
were
funneled
through--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
account
was
in
the
name
of
the
partnership.
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
was
not
labeled
as
a
corporate
account,
but
the
property
was
owned
by
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
was
the
obligor
on
the
loan.
so
basically
the
government's
position
is
that
although
they
called
it
an
individual
account,
they're
basically
skipping
a
step.
i
mean,
that
money
all
rebounded
to
the
corporation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
it
is.
in
moline,
the
court
specifically
stated
that
the
corporation
there
had
no
bank
accounts.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
in
both
cases,
the
income
was
attributable
to
the
property
in
which
the
corporation
held
title.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
because
the
corporation
here
owned
the
apartment
buildings
and
the
apartments
were
rented
out
and
the
tenants
paid
rent
to
the
owners--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
that's
just,
i
would
say
that's
a
descriptive
word.
the
partners
because
you've
got
a
controlled
corporation
and
the
corporation
obviously
doesn't
take
any
action
that's
not
directed
by
its
officers.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
mean,
the
facts
are
somewhat
confusing.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
in
most
of
the
cases
the
corporation
was
solely--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes.
in
most
of
the
cases,
the
corporation
was
solely
owned
by
bollinger
and
some
of
the
apartment
complexes,
the
partnerships
were
solely
bollinger,
and
some
he
had
other
partners
who
did
not
nominally
own
stock
in
the
corporation.
although,
as
we
explained
in
the
brief,
and
this
discussions
also
reflected
somewhat
in
the
national
carbide
decision,
i
think
that
the
partners
would
be
viewed
by
state
law
and
by
federal
income
tax
law
as
constructive
shareholders
in
these
partnerships.
because
they
were
making
payments
all
along
out
of
their
own
pockets
to
pay
corporate
expenses.
that's
normally
considered--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
what
you
get
down
to,
that's
the
bottom
line,
but
we
believe--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
there's
no
dispute
that
the
corporation
was
the
obligor
on
the
loan.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
part.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
i
have
to
disagree
with
that
statement.
i
mean
even
respondents
concede
in
their
brief
that
the
principal
obligor
on
the
loan
was
the
corporation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
in
the
moline
properties
case
originally
the
loan
was
taken
out
directly
by
the
individual,
and
then
the
bank
asked
them
to
set
up
this
corporation
and
so
the
corporation
then
assumed
the
liability,
assumed
the
mortgage.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
personal
guarantee
that
was
reflected
in
writing,
but
the
moline
case
is
clear
that
the
corporation
had
no
bank
accounts
and
had
no
money
in
its
own
name,
so
it's
clear
enough
that
the
individual
was
paying
the
loan
and
that
the
lender
was
looking
to
the
individual
for
the
payment
of
the
loan.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
here,
the
ultimate
security
is
also
the
property,
and
that
is
why
the
corporation
had
to
hold
record
title
to
the
property.
otherwise,
title
could
have
been
held
by
the
partners
and
they
could
have
avoided
some
of
these
problems.
but
a
lot
of
these
questions
are
focused
on
the
income
from
the
apartment
complexes.
and
of
course,
this
case
is
really,
at
least
the
particular
years
involved
here
about
the
deduction
of
the
expenses
and
the
losses
suffered
by
the
corporation
or
the
partners,
as
the
case
may
be
in
the
early
years.
certainly
a
large
portion
of
those
expenses
was
the
interest
expense
paid
on
the
loan
on
which
the
corporation
was
the
obligor
and
the
whole
system
wouldn't
work
unless
the
corporation
was
the
obligor.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
was
paid
out
of
this
construction
account
to
which
the
loan
proceeds
were
dumped
as
soon
as
they
were
received.
and
that
gets
you
back
to
the
original
conundrum,
i
suppose,
that
we
were
talking
about.
the
corporation
was
directed
to
dump
its
money
into
this
account
that
was
in
the
partners'
name.
now,
if
it
was
an
unrelated
corporation--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--at
this
point,
justice
scalia
will
have
to
remind
me.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
as
i
started
to
say--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
with
an
unrelated
agent,
it's
very
simple,
i
think.
in
the
case
of
a
controlled
corporation,
we
agree
that
it's
a
very
heavy
burden
that
they
have
to
bear.
they
have
to
show
that
the
relationship
was
equivalent
to
an
arm's
length
relationship
and
that
is
hard
to
do
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
corporation
was
set
up
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
handle
these
loans
of
these
particular
partnerships
that
controlled
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
not
to
me.
it
doesn't
sound
like
an
agency
because
of
the
peculiar
and
special
tax
structure
that
congress
has
set
up
between
corporations
and
shareholders
in
which
i
think
you
can
say
in
a
certain
loose
sense
that
a
relationship
between
a
corporation
and
its
shareholders
is
always
like
an
agency
in
the
sense
that
you're
referring
to.
the
corporation
is
a
legal
person,
but
it's
not
a
real
person,
and
it's
always
operating
for
the
benefit
of
its
shareholders.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
you
keep
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
avoid
answering
this
question.
we
gave
an
example
in
our
brief
of
the
sort
of
situation
where
we
think
it
would
be
pretty
clear
that
a
controlled
corporation
could
still
operate
as
an
independent
agent,
and
that
is
one
where
it
was
already
established
as
an
agent
and
was
operating
not
only
for
the
partners
that
controlled
it,
but
also
for
unrelated
parties.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
this
particular
situation--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no.
well,
we
don't
think
they
can
just
change
a
couple
of
facts.
i
mean,
in
this
case,
we
think
it's
the
fact
that
they
didn't
even
bother
to
pay
a
fee
to
the
agency
we
think
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
there
was
no
arm's
length
relationship.
but
even
if
they
had
paid
a
fee,--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--you
can
be
an
agent
without
being
compensated
but
it's
hard
to
describe
it
as
an
arm's
length
relationship,
if
there's
no
compensation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
zero,
because
the
corporation
is
doing
things.
it's
exposing
itself
to
liability,
for
example,
if
a
tenant
trips
on
the
ice
in
front
of
the
apartment
building
and
then
sues
the
corporation.
now,
i
mean,
here
because
the
corporation
was
hardly
different
from
bollinger,
that
may
seem
like
not
a
big
deal.
but
that
gets
you
back
to
the
argument
that
the
corporation
shouldn't
be
distinguished
from
the
shareholders
because
they
are
all
kind
of
intertwined
together,
mixed
up
in
the
same
thing.
that's
the
argument
that
the
court
rejected
in
moline.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
the
title
company
doesn't
charge
any
of
its
clients
anything?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
if
it
doesn't
charge
this
one,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
not
really
acting
as
an
arm's
length
agency.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
no.
if
it's
an
independent
corporation--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
probably
all
right
then.
i
mean,
the
whole
concern
of
national
carbide
is
distinguishing
the
control
of
the
corporation,
that
the
stockholders
exert
over--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--if
it
was
an
unrelated--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
the
problem
under
the
so-called
fifth
factor
of
national
carbide.
and
i
really
want
to
emphasize
that
that's
a
serious
problem
because
it's
that
problem
that
is
what
undermines
moline.
in
moline,
you've
established
a
tax
structure
in
which
the
corporation
and
shareholder
despite
their
identity
of
interest
need
to
be
treated
as
separate
taxable
entities.
and
in
this
case,
you
have
shareholders
that
are
trying
to
get
around
that
rule
essentially
by
saying,
well,
we'll
just
call
it
an
agent,
even
though
our
relationship
with
the
corporation
is
really
no
different.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
that's
right.
we're
saying
that
there's
at
least
a
presumption,
a
burden
that
the
shareholders
have
to
overcome
and
they
use
a
controlled
corporation
as
a
purported
agent
that
they
need
to
show
like
it's
really
like
dealing
with
an
unrelated
agent.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that's
right.
and
the
so-called
agency
adds
nothing
to
the
other
ways
that
you
have
of
controlling
the
corporation
and
therefore
it
doesn't
provide
a
reason
to
depart
from
what
would
ordinarily
be
the
tax
consequences
of
using
your
corporation.
i
really
would
like
to
emphasize
that
although
this
is
a
heavy
burden
that
may
be
difficult
to
meet,
we
don't
think
that
that's
unfair
or
unreasonable.
if
you
look
at
this
from
the
perspective
of
the
shareholders,
they
have
two
choices.
they
can
use
a
controlled
corporation,
if
they
really
want
to
use
an
agent,
let's
say,
they
can
use
a
controlled
corporation
as
an
agent
or
they
can
use
an
unrelated
corporation
as
an
agent.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
here,
they
needed
to
use
a
corporation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
if
you're
using
an
individual
as
an
agent,
you
don't
run
into
any
of
the
problems
that
you
have
here.
and
the
concern
here
is
whether
the
separate
tax
identity
of
a
corporation
is
going
to
be
disregarded.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
you
might
have
different
brackets,
but
i
don't
think
we'd
be
taking...
i
mean,
it's
just
not
a
concern.
the
concern
here
is
that
this
is
a
way
of
avoiding
corporate
tax.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
setting
up
the
corporation,
no.
the
reason
for
setting
up
the
corporation
was
to
get
the
loan
and
avoid
the
kentucky
usury
laws.
but
the
reason
for
this
litigation
is
tax
avoidance,
not
tax
avoidance
in
a
pejorative
sense,
but
the
tax
consequences
of
being
treated
as
a
partnership
are
more
advantageous
to
the
respondents
than
being
treated
as
a
corporation.
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
take
their
losses
immediately
and
offset
them
against
other
income
that
they
have
rather
than
if
it's
treated
as
a
corporation,
they'll
have
to
wait
to
take
the
losses
until
the
apartment
complexes
begin
to
show
profit
a
few
years
down
the
road.
so
it's
an
opportunity
to
accelerate
the
losses
that
the
take.
i'd
still
like
to
say
one
more
thing
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
i
think
basically
at
least
if
you're
going
to
use
a
corporation
as
an
agent,
you've
got
two
choices.
you
can
use
a
controlled
corporation,
you
can
use
an
unrelated
corporation.
now,
if
it's
truly
an
arm's
length
relationship,
there's
really
no
reason
not
to
use
an
unrelated
corporation.
and
therefore
we
think
the
fact
that
these
kind
of
partnerships
always
use
a
controlled
corporation
and
the
facts
in
this
case
and
the
facts
in
the
frink
case
that's
also
pending
before
this
court,
both
reflect
that
the
partnerships
were
unwilling
to
enter
into
these
kind
of
agreements
unless
they
could
use
a
controlled
corporation.
they
reflect
that
there's
more
going
on
than
just
an
arm's
length
agency
relationship.
if
they're
going
to
choose
to
use
a
controlled
corporation,
there
ought
to
be
a
presumption
that
there
is
a
degree
of
control
that's
being
exercised
that's
different
from
the
normal
principal
agent
relationship.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
why
is
it
cheaper,
justice
stevens?
it's
cheaper
only
because
the
corporation
is
related,
and
therefore--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
and
therefore
the
agent
is
giving
them
a
break
because
of
the
control
that
the
stockholders
exert
over
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
would
agree
that
$100
a
year
here
or
there
should
not,
that
the
court
should
not
come
up
with
a
ruling
that's
going
to
make
it
turn
on
that.
but
i
think
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
basic
principle
that
there's
this
entire
structure
set
up
that
recognizes
corporations
as
separate
entities,
even
though
they
may
be
doing
things
on
behalf
of
their
shareholders,
they're
not
very
different
from
the
kinds
of
things
that
an
agent
might
do
for
someone.
and
that's
structure
is
seriously
undermined
if
you
can
allow
the
shareholders
to
treat
some
of
the
operations
as
agency
operations,
and
not
treat
the
corporation
as
a
separate
entity
for
that.
if
you're
using
an
unrelated
agent,
then
the
agent
really
has
no
personal
interest
in
what
he's
doing,
and
kind
of
turns
it
all
over
to
the
principal
and
acts
in
the
name
of
the
principal.
but
when
you've
got
a
corporation--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
issue
because
you
wouldn't
have
the
apparent
control
there.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
position
the
service
would
take
there
because
i
don't
think
those
cases
have
come
up,
but
it
might
be
that
the
fact
that
the
partners
were
paying
all
the
expenses
and
everything
would
make
them
constructive
shareholders--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
what
i'm
saying,
and
the
fact
that
they're
paying
all
the
expenses,
i
think,
might
well
make
them
constructive
shareholders
of
the
corporation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
if
it's
an
unrelated
corporation
that
held
it
clearly
as
an
agent--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--did
it
take
out
the
loans?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that
sounds
like
an
agency
relationship
to
me
because
you
don't
have
the
moline
problem
of
needing
to
recognize
the
corporation
as
a
separate
taxable
entity,
because
you
don't
have
a
dealing
with
a
controlled
corporation.
i
mean,
moline
arises
only
in
the
case
of
or
it
addressed
the
relationship
between
the
corporation
and
the
shareholders
that
control
it,
and
how
the
tax
consequences
are
to
be
allocated
between
those
two.
when
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
relationship,
you
don't
run
into
the
sort
of
problems
that
national
carbide
dictum
is
concerned
about
and
the
government
is
concerned
about
in
this
case.
i
guess
my
time's
about
expired.
i'd
like
to
just
make
two
other
quick
points.
one
is
that
quite
apart
from
the
issue
we've
been
discussing
here,
we
think
in
this
case,
the
respondents
fail
the
sixth
factor
of
the
national
carbide
test
which
is
that
the
corporation's
here
did
not
act
as
agents
at
all,
they
acted
as
principles.
it
was
essential
to
the
success
of
the
whole
scheme
that
the
corporation
be
holding
the
title
in
its
own
name
and
take
out
the
loans
in
its
own
name,
not
on
behalf
of
the
partners
because
that
would
not
have
satisfied
the
kentucky
usury
laws.
and
second,
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
congress
has
dealt
with
these
kind
of
issues
in
some
detail
in
subchapter
s
of
the
code
in
which
they
have
recognized
that
in
certain
situations,
businesses
should
be
entitled
to
operate
as
corporations
and
still
have
the
tax
consequences
flow
through
to
the
individuals
as
partnerships.
but
congress
did
not
view
this
kind
of
situation
as
one
to
which
subchapter
s
should
apply.
and
because
of
a
specific
provision,
they
are
not
eligible
for
subchapter
s
treatment.
we
think
subchapter
s
would
be
somewhat
undermined
if
respondents
can
use
this
agency
mechanism
to
get
around
it.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
two
quick
points.
one
is
that
the
essence
of
the
holding
in
moline
is
that
a
dummy
corporation,
a
corporation
that
does
very
little
has
to
be
recognized
for
tax
purposes
if
it
engages
in
business
activity.
so
mr.
hembree's
contention
here--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
check
that,
justice
white,
since
you
mentioned
it
before.
i
don't
think
that
was
right.
i
thought
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
my
recollection
is
that
the
dispute
was
over
whether
the
corporation
would
have
to
pay
corporate
tax
and
it
was
the
government
that
wanted
to
collect
the
corporate
tax,
but
i
could
be
wrong.
i'm
not
sure.
i
will
check.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
point
i
want
to
is
that
mr.
hembree's
statement
that
the
corporation
should
not
be
recognized
here
because
it
did
so
little
is
exactly
the
contention
that
was
accepted
by
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
moline
and
reversed
by
this
court.
that's
exactly
inconsistent
with
moline,
and
the
more
general
proposition
that
what
the
code
wants
to
do
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
there
wasn't.
that's
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
actually
which
goes
to
justice
steven's
question
about
moline.
is
that
i
think
the
precise
holding
of
national
carbide,
is
that
you
can't
avoid
moline
simply
by
having
an
agency
agreement.
there
was
an
agency
agreement
in
national
carbide.
that
was
exactly
the
argument
that
the
taxpayer
tried
to
make
there.
and
what
national
carbide
said
is
that
that's
not
good
enough
because
the
agency
agreement
there
didn't
reflect
anything
different
than
the
kind
of
control
that
the
shareholders
exert
over
the
corporation.
they
just
put
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
said
that
the
subsidiaries
will
do
x,
y
and
z
as
agents.
but
it's
the
same
thing
that
the
shareholders
could
have
told
them
to
do
because
of
their
control.
it
has
to
be
something
different
from
a
shareholder
corporation
relationship.
and
that
is,
i
admit,
difficult
to
show
where
you
take
the
tack
of
setting
it
up
as
a
controlled
corporation
for
these
purposes.
it's
better
to
use
an
unrelated
agent.
but
that's,
you're
stuck
with
it
if
you
need
to
set
up
a
corporation
for
some
business
purpose
as
the
taxpayer
certainly
had
to
do
here,
then
you
are
stuck
with
the
tax
consequences
of
that.
and
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
they
complied
with
the
kentucky
usury
laws,
they
certainly
did
comply
with
the
kentucky
usury
laws.
